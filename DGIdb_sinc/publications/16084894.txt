objective: to determine the effect of 17␤-estradiol, progesterone,  xxxd2554xxx , levonorgestrel,
 xxxd2751xxx ,  xxxd3372xxx , and  xxxd3372xxx  metabolites on  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) isoforms 121 and
165 mrna in two breast cancer cell lines, mcf-7 ( xxxg730xxx  rich) and t47-d ( xxxg1737xxx 
rich), in vitro.
design: prospective basic research study.
setting: basic research laboratory.
patient(s): none.
intervention(s): mcf-7 and t47-d cells were cultured to 80% confluence in vitro. after 24 hours’ incubation in
serum-free media, 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 ␮m of 17␤-estradiol,  xxxd3372xxx , 3␣-hydroxytibolone and 3␤-hydroxytibolone
were added to mcf-7 cells. progesterone,  xxxd2554xxx , levonorgestrel,  xxxd2751xxx , and ⌬4
 xxxd3372xxx  at 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 ␮m were added to t47-d cells. the cells plus steroids were incubated for a further
24 hours.
main outcome measure(s): isolation and identification of vegf isoforms 121 and 165 using semiquantitative
polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis, with  xxxg798xxx  as an internal control.
result(s): 17␤-estradiol,  xxxd3372xxx , 3␣-hydroxytibolone, and 3␤-hydroxytibolone had no effect on vegf mrna
in mcf-7 cells. progesterone,  xxxd2554xxx , levonorgestrel, and  xxxd2751xxx  increased vegf
mrna in t47-d cells. ⌬4- xxxd3372xxx  also increased vegf mrna but to a lesser extent than the progestogens.
conclusion(s): 17␤-estradiol,  xxxd3372xxx , and  xxxd3372xxx  hydroxy-metabolites had no effect on vegf mrna in
mcf-7 cells. progesterone and progestins increased vegf mrna in t47-d breast cancer cells, but ⌬4- xxxd3372xxx 
was less effective than progestogens on this angiogenic gene in the t-47 d cells. this differential effect may be
related to breast cancer growth. (fertil steril威 2005;84:485–91. ©2005 by american society for reproductive

evidence from the women’s health initiative (whi) suggests that estrogen (e2) plus  xxxd2554xxx 
(mpa) increases the risk of breast cancer after 5 years of use
(1). the e2-alone arm of the whi found that the risk of
breast cancer was not increased after an average of 7 years of
use of unopposed e2 (2). these data suggest the possibility
that progestins may play a more important role in the growth
of breast tumors. estrogens alone as well as e2 plus the
synthetic progestins mpa,  xxxd2751xxx  (net), and
levonorgestrel (lng) have been reported to be associated
with an increase in the relative risk of breast cancer (3).

the action of progesterone (p4) on the human breast is
inconsistent. during the luteal phase of the natural cycle
when progesterone (p) levels are high, p4 has a proliferative
effect based on mitotic activity (4). observations from randomized controlled trials indicate that p4 used in postmenopausal women appears to be an antiproliferative agent (5).
the metabolism of synthetic progestins is poorly understood.  xxxd2554xxx  has been shown to undergo a ring reduction, hydroxylation at carbons 6 and 21,
and conjugation (primarily glucuronidation) (6). after an
oral pharmacologic dose of 10 mg of mpa, circulating
concentrations of 3–5 ng/ml are achieved 1 to 4 hours after
dosing. the half-life of mpa is 24 hours, and is mostly
bound nonspecifically to albumin. it has been shown that
net and lng undergo extensive a ring reduction, forming
reduced (and to a lesser extent, hydroxylated) metabolites.
mean peak levels of net and lng are observed 1 to 2 hours
after oral administration (6).

in vitro, progestins have been shown to inhibit, stimulate,
or have no effect on proliferation of breast cancer cells (7–9).
the effect of progestins on enzyme pathways capable of
synthesizing e2 within the breast has been extensively investigated. coldham and james (10) reported that mpa
stimulated the activity of 17␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reductase type i (17␤-hsd 1). on the other hand,
progestins such as lng and net were found to increase
both the oxidative and reductive activity of 17␤-hsd (11).
 xxxd3372xxx  ( xxxd3372xxx ; n.v. organon, oss, the netherlands), a
selective tissue estrogenic activity regulator (stear), is a
synthetic steroid that is used to treat or prevent menopausal
symptoms and osteoporosis. after oral administration,  xxxd3372xxx  is metabolized into three different metabolites, 3␣hydroxytibolone (3␣-tib), 3␤-hydroxytibolone (3␤-tib), and
⌬4  xxxd3372xxx  (⌬4-tib) (12).  xxxd3372xxx  inhibits the growth of
dmba-induced breast tumors in animal models (12).  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites also have been shown to have both
a proapoptotic and antiproliferative effect in both normal and
breast cancer cells in vitro (13). moreover,  xxxd3372xxx , 3␣-tib,
3␤-tib, and ⌬4-tib have been shown to reduce the formation
of biologically active free e2 in the breast, by altering several
enzyme pathways (14).
a recent prospective randomized study showed that
mammographic density is decreased after 12 months of
 xxxd3372xxx  use. in contrast, users of  xxxd2044xxx  (cee) plus mpa have an increased mammography density (15). the same study found that  xxxd3372xxx  use
resulted in antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in
human breast, whereas cee plus mpa induced a proliferative effect only (15).
angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels, is
essential for both breast tumor growth and metastasis (16).
although tumors lacking adequate vasculature become necrotic or apoptotic, tumors that have undergone neovascularization may not only enter a phase of rapid growth but
may also have increased metastatic potential (16).
breast tumor growth has been linked to an increased
production of  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf)
within the tumor (16). a potent angiogenic factor, vegf is
responsive to steroids (17). higher levels of vegf are found
in breast cancers compared with surrounding normal tissue
(18). high vegf levels have been correlated with both a
poor prognosis and a decrease in the overall survival of
breast cancer patients (19).
our experiments were designed to investigate the effect of
e2, p4, mpa, lng, net,  xxxd3372xxx , and  xxxd3372xxx  metabolites
on vegf mrna in two different breast cancer cell lines:
mcf-7 ( xxxg730xxx  rich) and t47-d (p receptor rich).
our hypothesis was that different steroids alter vegf
mrna expression, and that these alterations might be indicative of breast cancer growth in vivo.

materials and methods
breast cancer cells and culture
after mcf-7 breast cancer cells ( xxxg730xxx  rich cell
line) and t47-d breast cancer cells (p receptor rich cell line)
were obtained from american tissue culture collection
(atcc, rockville, md), they were grown in dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium (dmem; gibco, grand island,
ny) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (hyclone,
logan, ut). cells were maintained in 75-ml culture flasks
(corning incorporated, corning, ny) at 37°c in a 95% air,
5% co2 humidified incubator. the medium was changed
every other day. the cells were passed as required. the cells
were then seeded in a 6-well culture plate (corning) to give
a cell density of 0.25 ⫻ 106 cells per dish. the culture
medium was then replaced by phenol red-free dmem
(gibco) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped bovine
serum for 48 hours, during which time the cells proliferated
to 70% to 80% confluence. the charcoal-stripped bovine
serum was prepared by adding 20 grams of dextran-coated
charcoal (sigma) to 1 liter of bovine serum (sigma) and
mixing overnight at 4°c. the charcoal was then removed by
centrifugation and filtration.
treatments with 17␤-estradiol, p, mpa, lng, net,
 xxxd3372xxx  and  xxxd3372xxx  metabolites
the  xxxg730xxx  rich cell line, mcf-7 cells, was treated
with e2 (sigma),  xxxd3372xxx , and the two estrogenic metabolites of  xxxd3372xxx , 3␣-tib and 3␤-tib (nv organon). the p
receptor rich cell line, t47-d cells, was treated with p4,
lng, mpa, net (sigma), and the progestogenic metabolite
of  xxxd3372xxx , ⌬4-tib (nv organon). the individual steroids
were added in concentrations of 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 ␮m to
appropriate wells containing either mcf-7 or t47-d cells.
the concentration of steroid was selected based on our
previous experience (20). the control for all incubations was
media with ethanol only (final concentration of ethanol below 0.1%), which was the solvent for the steroids. the
incubation time after the addition of the individual steroid
was 24 hours. the cells from each well were then harvested
and stored at ⫺80°c until used for isolation of mrna.
rna isolation
we isolated the mrna as described elsewhere (20). the
extraction of poly (a)⫹rna was obtained by oligo (dt)
chromatography using a commercially available kit (microfast track; invitrogen, san diego, ca), following the manufacturer’s specifications. after rna isolation, the mrna
was treated with 1 u of rqi rnase free dnase i and 40 u of
rnasin, an rnase inhibitor (promega, madison, wi), in tris
buffer (1.5 mm mgcl2, 50 mm kcl, 10 mm tris-hcl) for
0.5 hours at 37°c to remove any residual genomic dna. the
mrna was then quantitated spectrophotometrically via its
absorption at a260. each sample was then evaporated to
dryness and resuspended in rna buffer (10 mm nacl, 10
mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0 and 1 mm edta) and stored at
⫺70°c until further analysis.

semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
was performed using a commercially available kit (perkinelmer, norwalk, ct) (20). briefly, 50 ng of mrna is
reverse transcribed in 10 ␮l aliquots of reaction mixture
consisting of 1 mm dntps, 2.5 u/␮l of m-mlv reverse
transcriptase, 1 u/␮l of rnase inhibitor, and 2.5 ␮m of
random hexamers in a buffer containing 50 mm kcl; 10
mm tris-hcl, ph 8.3;, and 5 mm mgcl2 for 40 minutes at
42°c, followed by heating to 99°c for 5 minutes, then
cooling to 5°c for 5 minutes. for quantitative pcr, vegf
cdna was amplified in the same tube with  xxxg798xxx 
cdna, which served as an internal control. an aliquot of
each reverse transcribed product (10 ␮l) was added to a final
volume of 80 ␮l of reaction mix containing 2.5 u of taq
polymerase (perkin elmer) 50 mm kcl, 10 mm tris-hcl,
ph 8.3, and 1.25 mm mgcl; the primers pairs for vegf and
 xxxg798xxx ; and 1.5 ␮ci of [␣-33] dctp (specific activity
3000 ci/mmol; dupont, boston, ma). the polymerase amplification was carried out for 32 cycles for vegf after we
had estimated the exponential phase for each set of coamplification reactions.
amplification of vegf cdna was initiated with denaturation for 3 minutes at 94°c followed by 32 cycles of
1-minute denaturation at 94°c, 1-minute annealing at 55°c,
and a 72°c extension cycle (1 minute). each pcr product is
then directly applied to 7% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without any treatment and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. the pcr-amplified fragments were excised
from each gel and dissolved overnight using 0.5 n quaternary ammonium hydroxide in toluene (soluenen 350; packard instruments company, meriden, ct). after the addition
of scintillation fluid, the samples were measured by scintillation spectroscopy. the results are expressed as a ratio of
counts per minute (cpm) of vegf mrna divided by  xxxg798xxx  mrna.
statistical analysis of results
the mean value for vegf obtained from three different
experiments within each hormone-treated group were comfertility and sterility姞

pared against control and against the other treatments using
the least significant difference (lsd) with p⬍.05 as a statistically significant difference. the analysis was performed
using sas version 8.0 (sas institute inc., cary, nc).
results
incubations in mcf-7 cell line
we demonstrated vegf mrna for the 121 and 165 isoforms in mcf-7 cells.  xxxg730xxx  (er) mrna was
verified in mcf-7 cells. minimal expression of progesterone
receptor (pr) was identified in this cell line. we conducted
a series of time-curve experiments to evaluate the effect of
e2 on vegf mrna expression. the mcf-7 cells were
incubated with e2 for 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours. we were
unable to demonstrate any increment of vegf mrna above
the control value in any of our experiments. also, we were
unable to observe any effect of  xxxd3372xxx , 3␣-tib and 3␤-tib,
compared with control on either vegf 121 or 165 isoforms
mrna in multiple experiments using mcf-7 cells in vitro
(data not shown).
incubations in t47-d cell line
 xxxg1737xxx  mrna was identified in t47-d cells,
but expression of er was not identified in this cell line.
progesterone at all concentrations increased vegf mrna
121 and 165 isoforms above control levels (p⬎.05) (figs. 1,
2).  xxxd2554xxx  at all concentrations increased vegf 121 and 165 mrna compared with control
(p⬍.05). levonorgestrel at all doses increased both vegf
isoforms (p⬍.05).  xxxd2751xxx  also increased vegf 121
and 165 isoforms in a dose-response manner (p⬍.05). when
compared with control ⌬4-tib increased vegf 121 and 165
mrna at 1.0 and 0.1 ␮m, respectively (p⬍.05), but expression of vegf 121 and 165 isoforms mrna were no different than control with ⌬4-tib at 0.01 ␮m concentration
(p⬍.1).
 xxxd2554xxx , lng, and net at 1.0 ␮m
had the same effect on vegf 121 and 165 mrna ⌬4-tib at
the same concentration only increased the two vegf isoforms mrna to 70% of the effect found with the synthetic
progestins.
compared with the other progestins, mpa at a concentration of 0.1 ␮m had a greater effect on vegf mrna. this
effect was at least 20% greater than that of lng and net,
and 50% greater than that of ⌬4-tib at similar concentrations
(figs. 1, 2).
discussion
our study appears to be the first to evaluate the effect of
various steroids on vegf mrna in two different breast
cancer cell lines. estradiol,  xxxd3372xxx , 3␣-tib, and 3␤-tib were
investigated in mcf-7 cell line ( xxxg730xxx  rich breast
cancer cell line). the effect of p4, synthetic progestins

(mpa, lng, and lng), and ⌬4-tib were evaluated in the pr
rich breast cancer cell line t47-d.
our results demonstrate that neither e2,  xxxd3372xxx , nor the
estrogen metabolites of  xxxd3372xxx  increased vegf mrna
above control levels in mcf-7 cells in vitro. progesterone,
mpa, net, and lng increased vegf mrna expression in
t47-d breast cancer cells. the progestogenic metabolite of
 xxxd3372xxx , ⌬4-tib, had less effect on vegf mrna expression
than did p and the synthetic progestins.
one important step is required to allow breast tumors to
grow, invade, and metastasize. this is the capacity of the
tumor to promote angiogenesis. breast cancers require neovascularization to progress beyond a few millimeters in
diameter (21). the best characterized of the angiogenic
factors that are involved in tumor growth is vegf, which
induces proliferation and migration in vitro of endothelial
cells while inhibiting apoptosis (22). in vivo, vegf both
stimulates angiogenesis and enhances permeability of the
capillaries. this increment in the capillary permeability is
thought to facilitate the extravasation and metastasis of tumor cells. the major distinguishing feature between normal
capillaries and tumor vessels is the “leakiness” of the latter
(17).

mirkin et al.

both abnormal and normal breast cells synthesize and
secrete vegf (22). the most widely expressed isoforms,
vegf 121 and vegf 165, are freely soluble. we have
demonstrated mrna for both secreted isoforms (121 and
165) in mcf-7 and t47-d cells; however, we were unable to
identify either the 189 or 206 isoform in these cells.
a number of factors play an important role in the regulation of vegf in the breast. levels of vegf mrna in the
normal breast are higher in premenopausal than in postmenopausal women, suggesting that steroid hormones may
increase vegf in the breast (23).
we were unable to demonstrate any increment of vegf
mrna in any of our experiments with differing concentrations of e2,  xxxd3372xxx , or the two estrogenic metabolites of
 xxxd3372xxx . we conducted a series of time-curve experiments
to evaluate the effect of e2 on the vegf genes to be sure that
we were not overlooking an early stimulus by e2. the
mcf-7 cells were incubated with e2 for 4, 12, 24, and 48
hours without evidence of up-regulation of the mrna for
the two vegf isoforms.
contradictory findings have been published regarding the
effect of e2 on vegf mrna in mcf-7 cells (18, 24 –27).

as proposed by hyder et al. (27), “fluctuation of several
factors in cell lines in different laboratories could explain
some discrepancies between the results of various investigators using similar experimental conditions.”
 xxxd3372xxx , 3␣-tib, and 3␤-tib did not increase vegf
mrna above control levels in this mcf-7 cell line. both
3␣-tib and 3␤-tib are metabolites of  xxxd3372xxx  with low affinity for the  xxxg730xxx ; 3␣-tib and 3␤-tib have been
shown to inhibit sulfatase and 17␤-hsd type i activities in
breast cancer cell line, and to induce apoptosis in normal
breast cells in vitro (13).
cline et al. (28) observed an antiproliferative effect of
 xxxd3372xxx  in the cynomolgus monkey breast. in humans,  xxxd3372xxx  decreased the breast bi-rads score (an index of breast
density) after 12 months of use, and is believed to be proapoptotic (assessed as expression of bcl-2) and have an
antiproliferative effect (assessed as expression of ki67) in
the breast (15). these facts, in addition to our finding of a
lack of vegf mrna stimulation by the estrogenic metabolites of  xxxd3372xxx , might indicate a favorable effect of this
compound on the breast. however, this suggestion should be
taken with caution until the outcome of current randomized
clinical trials assessing the effect of  xxxd3372xxx  on the incidence of breast cancer are published.
fertility and sterility姞

we evaluated the effect of different p4, progestins, and
the progestagenic metabolite of  xxxd3372xxx , ⌬4-tib, on vegf
mrna in pr rich t47-d breast cancer cells. progesterone,
mpa, lng, and net all increased vegf mrna to a
greater extent than did ⌬4-tib. our findings suggest that p
and synthetic progestins may have a greater effect on breast
cancer angiogenesis than ⌬4-tib. the clinical effects of this
increase in angiogenic activity might be related to breast
tumor growth. this hypothesis is certainly speculative because there has not been any means of correlating in vitro
and in vivo outcomes. we used concentrations of the progestins in vitro that are much greater than those found in
vivo. the effect of the difference in hormonal concentrations
between in vivo situations and our in vitro experiments
should be interpreted with caution. it should be noted that
concentrations of vegf in human breast neoplasia appear to
be correlated with both metastasis and prognosis (19).
 xxxd2554xxx  had a greater effect on
vegf mrna than lng and net at similar concentrations
in the same in vitro system. these data suggest that there
might be a potential difference in breast angiogenesis associated with these progestins. compared with other progestins, mpa has been shown to have the highest proliferative
rate on breast cancer cells in vitro (29). the up-regulation of
489

vegf mrna with progestins and ⌬4-tib in t47-d cells is
mediated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. this
effect is blocked by the antiprogestin mifepristone in breast
cancer cells in vitro (30). three functional p response elements (pres) have been described in the vegf gene, lending support to this observation (31).
progesterone stimulated vegf mrna in t47-d cells
after 24 hours of treatment. this was in agreement with the
findings of other investigators (30). wu et al. (31) had
demonstrated a similar stimulation of vegf mrna using a
different t47-d breast cancer cell line. it is interesting that
these investigators showed a greater stimulation in the cells
that only express pr-b. it is apparent that pr-a and pr-b
have different physiological functions and regulate different
genes (32). in human breast tissue, vegf levels are increased during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle when
p levels are elevated (33). these data would support our
hypothesis that progestational steroids can up-regulate
vegf mrna.
we found that ⌬4-tib stimulated mrna to a lesser extent
than either p or the other synthetic progestins. other investigators have evaluated the effect of ⌬4-tib on breast cells
under different in vitro conditions; ⌬4-tib has been reported
to inhibit sulfatase and to increase 17␤-dhs ii activities in
the t47-d cell line in vitro (14). these effects, which result
in lower conversion of estrone or  xxxd2046xxx  to e2, are
interpreted as a possible mechanism whereby  xxxd3372xxx  or its
metabolites could reduce the occurrence of breast neoplasia.
we have demonstrated that p and synthetic progestins
(including ⌬4-tib, a metabolite of  xxxd3372xxx ) increase vegf
mrna expression in pr rich t47-d breast cancer cells in
vitro. however, none of the estrogens investigated in the
estrogen-receptor positive mcf-7 cells increased vegf
mrna levels above control levels. we interpret these data
as indicating a potential mechanism of action of the progestational steroids that could influence the growth of breast
neoplasms.
