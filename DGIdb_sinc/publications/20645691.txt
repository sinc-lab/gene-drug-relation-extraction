evaluation of: reid ah, attard g, danila dc et al. significant and sustained antitumor activity
in post-docetaxel, castration-resistant prostate cancer with the  xxxg573xxx  inhibitor  xxxd55xxx 
acetate. j. clin. oncol. 28(9), 1489–1495 (2010).
inhibition of cytochrome p17 ( xxxg573xxx ), which is involved in androgen synthesis, is a promising
therapeutic strategy for castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc). the first multicenter, phase ii
study of a  xxxg573xxx  inhibitor, the small molecule  xxxd55xxx  acetate, has been conducted on
47 patients that received prior docetaxel chemotherapy for prostate cancer. with 1000 mg once
daily, declines of more than 50% in  xxxg1281xxx  and circulating tumor cell counts
were seen in 51 and 63% of patients, respectively. overall, the drug was well tolerated and had
a significant antitumor activity with symptomatic improvements. reid and colleagues’ study
highlights  xxxd55xxx  as a key molecule in crpc treatment and gives further evidence of the
involvement of the  xxxg183xxx  signaling axis in the disease. a randomized phase iii trial
is ongoing to define the prognostic impact of this drug among the very limited arsenal of drugs
currently available for crpc. in the meantime, other  xxxg573xxx  inhibitors are expected to show a
favorable safety and efficacy profile, as are other novel powerful agents and combinatorial
therapeutic strategies.

prostate cancer is the most common non­
cutaneous tumor in males and the third leading cancer-related cause of death in men in
the developed world [1] . prostate cancer may
remain hormone driven and so it is properly
named as castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc) and is no longer described as
‘hormone-resistant’ or ‘hormone-refractory’
prostate cancer. patients with crpc showed
a median survival advantage of approximately
18 months after docetaxel chemotherapy (a
us fda-approved therapeutic modality) [1] .
however, for many years there have been
very few viable alternatives for patients with
docetaxel-resistant cancer.
 xxxd55xxx  acetate is an orally active acetate salt with antiandrogen activity. currently,
 xxxd55xxx  is under investigation for use in
crpc, which frequently remains hormone
dependent [2–4] . this drug inhibits the enzymatic activity of the steroid 17a-monooxygenase (17a-hydrolase/ and c17, 20 lyase complex), which is a member of the cytochrome

p450 family ( xxxg573xxx  or cyp450c17) that
catalyzes the 17a-hydroxylation of steroid
intermediates involved in testosterone synthesis. administration of this agent may suppress
testosterone production by both the testes and
the adrenals to castrate-range levels.
the effects of  xxxg573xxx  inhibition had been
investigated previously, taking advantage of
the inhibitory properties of the antifungal
drug ketoconazole. however, ketoconazole is
nonselective and is not amenable to be specifically used for this purpose.  xxxd55xxx 
( xxxd55xxx ) is an oral, selective and irreversible
inhibitor of  xxxg573xxx . it is much more effective
than ketoconazole, but suffers from poor availability. for this reason, the institute of cancer
research (london, uk) created the prodrug
 xxxd55xxx  acetate (cb7630), which is rapidly
deacetylated to the active meta­bolite in vivo.
cougar biotechnology, inc. (los angeles, ca,
usa), conducted the research. so far cougar
has tested the drug in phase i, ii and iii clinical trials for prostate cancer. on july 10, 2009,

methods & results

in the first study, run at the royal marsden hospital (london,
uk)  xxxd55xxx  acetate was administered continuously daily in
patients who had not received prior chemotherapy. the compound induced a significant decline in  xxxg1281xxx 
(psa) in up to 70% of patients, as well as radiological regression
of tumors in both soft tissue and bone and symptomatic improvements. importantly,  xxxd55xxx  acetate was active at all doses
tested and was well tolerated [2] .
very recently, the same investigators conducted a more
advanced, multicenter, two-stage phase ii trial [5] . a total of
47 crpc patients, median age 67 years, were enrolled from
december 2006 to august 2007. all the patients had received
prior steroid therapy with docetaxel. in this study,  xxxd55xxx 
acetate 1000 mg (four 250 mg capsules) was orally administered, once daily, continuously, to the patients in 28‑day cycles.
the primary end point was the accomplishment of a decline
in psa of more than 50% in at least seven out of 35 patients.
more than 35 patients could be enrolled if the primary goal
was achieved. the secondary aims included psa declines of
more than 30 and 90%, rate of response evaluation criteria
in solid tumors (recist) responses and their duration, psa
progression time, circulating tumor cell (ctc) enumeration,
and of course a guarantee of safety issues.
in this report,  xxxd55xxx  acetate reduced psa levels, as well
as dramatically reducing the size of the tumors. the primary end
point was met in 24 out of 47 (51%) prostate cancer patients,
and the time to psa progression was prolonged by 161 days in
patients who had been treated with chemotherapy. declines
of ctc count of more than 50% were seen in 17 out of 27
(63%) patients after starting treatment with  xxxd55xxx  acetate.
maximal changes in ctc counts did not generally correlate
with maximal psa variations. interestingly enough, however,
psa and ctc were significantly associated in the subset of
patients with erg gene-rearrangement tumors, as opposed to
the complete lack of correlation in non-erg gene-rearrangement
tumors. regarding the manifested adverse events,  xxxd55xxx 
acetate was well tolerated. the patients showed the expected
toxicities related to anti­a ndrogen therapy, such as hypokalemia
(55%), hypertension (17%) and fluid retention (15%), and these
were easily managed with mineral corticoid receptor agonist
 xxxd2010xxx  or low-dose glucocorticoids. although the size of the
phase ii study was not sufficient to rule out any additional and
potentially serious side effects, it was clearly shown that all of
the most common side effects were easily managed.
discussion & significance

 xxxd55xxx  acetate seems to be a very promising compound in
crpc patients, and is generally well tolerated. the toxicities
after administration of  xxxd55xxx  had been expected since the
1028

first phase i study. hypokalemia, hypertension, and fluid retention appeared as a result of an increase in adrenocorticotrophic
hormones and a resultant excess of mineralocorticoid steroids
upstream of the  xxxg573xxx  pathway; these were overcome with
standard symptomatic therapy.
the english group alone, at the royal marsden hospital,
recently showed that ctc counts predict overall survival and
provide independent prognostic information regarding time to disease progression [6] . psa levels and ctc counts were significantly
correlated in patients with erg gene-rearrangement tumors and
this relationship provides information regarding the compound’s
mechanism of action.
in the phase ii trial, the examples of radiological responses in at
least two of the patients (patients 10 and 25) are absolutely spectacular. computed tomography and technetium tc 99m methy­
lene  xxxd2553xxx  (99mtc-mdp) bone scintigraphy showed
striking reductions of nodal and bony metastatic diseases.
a phase iii study compared the clinical benefit of  xxxd55xxx  acetate plus prednisone with placebo plus prednisone in
1158 patients with metastatic crpc who had failed one or two
previous chemotherapy regimens. at least one of the previous
chemotherapy regimens should have contained docetaxel [101] .
this phase iii trial is now closed and the ctc data from the
phase ii trial are going to be incorporated as an intermediate end
point of outcome in crpc. another phase iii study, still ongoing, is comparing the clinical benefit of  xxxd55xxx  acetate plus
prednisone with placebo plus prednisone in asymptomatic patients
or mildly symptomatic patients with metastatic crpc [102] .
expert commentary

castration-resistant prostate cancer patients show increasing
psa levels, suggesting resumption of transcription of hormoneregulated genes,  xxxg183xxx  overexpression and upregulation of enzymes involved in androgen biosynthesis, which results
in reactivation of the receptor. since crpc remains addicted
to steroid receptor signaling, including, but not exclusive to,
 xxxg183xxx , how does reactivation occur? and if prostate
cancers lose this addiction, do they remain driven by the same
oncogenic mechanisms? further understanding of the resistance mechanisms and androgen biosynthesis pathways, may
lead to the development of powerful new antiandrogens and
androgen-depleting agents [7,8] . among these, promising activity
has been shown since the early-phase tests by  xxxd55xxx  acetate
[2,5] , a cyp17a inhibitor that blocks steroid biosynthesis in the
adrenal gland and possibly within the tumor, and  xxxd2003xxx , a
new  xxxg183xxx  antagonist that blocks androgens from
binding to the  xxxg183xxx  and prevents nuclear trans­
location and co-activator recruitment of the ligand–receptor
complex. a phase i/ii study (nct00510718) tested  xxxd2003xxx 
in 140 patients in five us centers, and reported antitumor activity at all doses, including decreases in serum psa of 50% or more
in 78 out of 140 patients (56%) and conversion from unfavorable to favorable ctc counts in 25 out of 51 patients (49%)
[9] . at present, both  xxxd55xxx  and  xxxd2003xxx  are undergoing
phase iii clinical trials.

efficacy of  xxxd55xxx  acetate in post-docetaxel crpc

in the phase ii study, reid and collaborators observed the
encouraging antitumor activity of  xxxd55xxx  acetate in crpc
patients previously treated with docetaxel [5] . the study is of high
quality and is well designed but the number of patients is still
small and we are awaiting the results from the phase iii trials for
further confirmation. it is worth mentioning that in phase i  xxxd55xxx  also demonstrated antitumor activity in crpc patients
who received prior ketoconazole therapy [10] .
at the moment, other  xxxg573xxx  inhibitors are available but are
not yet developed enough to be evaluated in clinical trials. since
steroidal compounds often exhibit side effects attributable to
their structure, a german group tried to replace the molecular scaffold with nonsteroidal core structures. the activities of
these designer molecules have been tested with recombinant
human  xxxg573xxx  expressed in escherichia coli. among 20 new
 xxxd55xxx  mimetics designed, compounds 19 and 20 showed
activity comparable with  xxxd55xxx  and similar or even better
selectivity than the other cyp enzymes [11] . the same scientists
in another study synthesized 35 novel substituted imidazolyl
methylene biphenyls as  xxxg573xxx  inhibitors for the treatment of
prostate cancer. the core rigidified compounds (30–35) were
the most active ones, being much more potent than ketoconazole
and reaching the activity of  xxxd55xxx . however, they were
not very selective. compared with  xxxd55xxx , molecule 23 was
more active in vivo, showed a longer plasma half-life (10 h) and
had a higher bioavailability [12] .
in the prostate cancer treatment scenario there is an increased
number of compounds acting on other signaling networks,
besides the  xxxg183xxx  signaling pathway, such as signal
transduction pathway inhibitors including farnesyltransferase
inhibitors (ras-regulated signaling pathways), serine/threonineprotein kinase inhibitors (r af/mek/erk pathway), rapa­
mycin kinase inhibitors (mtor signaling pathway), heat-shock
protein hsp90 inhibitors and transcription factor inhibitors
(i.e., prolactin– xxxg2216xxx  and  xxxg1181xxx –stat3 signaling pathways)
[1] . other molecules, such as growth factors and their receptors, cell survival, angiogenesis pathways, metastasis suppressor
genes, gene and vaccine therapy, as well as combinatorial therapeutic strategies may all contribute significantly in the clinical
arena of advanced metastatic prostate cancer [1] . for instance, a
novel image-guided mda7/il24 gene-therapy approach based
on ultrasound-­mediated technology may become, in the future,
a nontoxic and effective alternative to standard adjuvant therapeutic treatment in primary and metastatic prostate cancer
patients [13] .
novel prostate cancer vaccines attempt to induce clinically relevant, cancer-specific systemic immune responses in patients with
prostate cancer and represent a new class of targeted, nontoxic
therapies. autologous antigen-presenting cell vaccines loaded
with the antigen  xxxg46xxx  and poxvirus vaccines
targeting psa have recently demonstrated a significant survival
benefit in randomized trials of patients with metastatic crpc.
combination of vaccines with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and
other biologic agents and selection of ideal patient populations
are under evaluation. one agent in particular, the  xxxd3205xxx

vaccine (dendreon corporation, wa, usa) was designed to stimulate t-cell immunity against  xxxg46xxx  and has
been recently approved by the fda [1,14] .
prostate cancer screening reinforces the study’s ability to reach
survival benefit. even when the trial targets the population most
likely to benefit, and employs a potent drug, we should use extra
care to minimize the adverse effects. indeed, even when the
therapy is aimed at a lethal condition and adverse effects are nonlife-threatening, they might still shift the balance and reduce
therapeutic compliance, affecting the desired outcome of the
whole therapeutic process. hot flushes are an important example
of side-effects requiring treatment even though they are nonlife-threatening, and are the most common complaints reported
by men undergoing androgen suppression treatment for prostate
cancer. in a randomized double-blind trial at 106 urology centers
in france between 2004 and 2007, 6 months of treatment with
 xxxd2463xxx , venlafaxine, cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone
proved to be effective in reducing hot flushes. however, the hormonal treatments cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone were
significantly more effective than venlafaxine. as cyproterone
is a recognized treatment in prostate cancer, and its use could
interfere with hormonal therapy, medroxyprogesterone could
be considered to be the standard treatment for hot flushes in
men undergoing androgen suppression for prostate cancer [15] .
it is demonstrated that high intratumoral levels of androgens
and active  xxxg183xxx  signaling are present in crpc,
suggesting that androgens may also be synthesized de novo.
inhibiting the systemic biosynthesis of androgens in crcp by
targeting  xxxg573xxx  with inhibitors such as  xxxd55xxx  acetate may
represent a rational therapeutic approach since the enzyme catalyzes steroid reactions in the androgen biosynthesis pathway.
the phase ii clinical trial by reid and co-investigators [5] was
successful but the results are still to be considered preliminary,
until the phase iii trials are completed. many other  xxxg573xxx 
inhibitors are under development, as well as many other drugs
that target different signaling pathways in metastatic prostate
cancer. the aim is for all of them to undergo trials and gain
approval from regulatory agencies; therefore, they will constitute
a tangible hope for a subset of patients that currently have very
limited resources.

ketoconazole. it is a prodrug that is rapidly deacetylated to the active metabolite in vivo.
• in a phase ii study of  xxxd55xxx  acetate in crpc patients that had received prior docetaxel chemotherapy, most of the patients
demonstrated a significant survival advantage. the primary end point of the study, namely reduction of  xxxg1281xxx  (psa)
of at least 50%, was reached in more than 50% of the patients, as opposed to a target of 20% or more.
• most secondary end points showed favorable outcomes, including further psa decrease, visible organ involvement and, notably,
decreased circulating tumor cell counts, which decreased by more than 50% in 63% of the patients.
•  xxxd55xxx  acetate is the first of a series of androgen inhibitors that promise to offer a specific and important prognostic advantage in
docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer and/or in synergic combination with docetaxel.
