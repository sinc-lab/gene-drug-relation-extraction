a new drug might make a positive contribution to existing therapies for hypertension by: 1) reducing blood
pressure (bp) via a novel pharmacologic mechanism; 2)
possessing pharmacologic or pharmacokinetic properties that make it superior to other members of its class;
or 3) facilitating bp control in refractory patients. in
this paper, we review four experimental agents that
promise to advance therapeutics by one of these mechanisms.  xxxd113xxx  is the ﬁrst in a new class of potent,
orally effective  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors.  xxxd113xxx  produces
dose-dependent bp reduction with few side effects
and constitutes a novel pharmacologic approach to
 xxxg1950xxx -angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition.  xxxd2704xxx  is
a third-generation, cardioselective beta -blocker that produces vasodilation and improves endothelial function
via the l-arginine/ xxxd2738xxx  pathway.  xxxd1715xxx  is an
ultra–short-acting, vascular-selective, dihydropyridine
calcium antagonist that is being developed for intravenous use in acute hospitalized patients.  xxxd1814xxx  is
an endothelina selective endothelin receptor antagonist
that is effective in achieving bp control in a signiﬁcant
percentage of patients who remain uncontrolled despite
treatment with three or more antihypertensive drugs.

introduction
many pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic modalities
are currently used for the treatment of elevated blood
pressure (bp). a variety of drugs are available that lower
bp by diverse pharmacologic mechanisms, including
diuresis, vasodilation, and interference with the two
primary neurohormonal systems that regulate bp—the
sympathetic nervous system (sns) and the  xxxg1950xxx -angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas). indeed, there are
more therapies available for hypertension than for

almost any condition in medicine. how, then, can new
pharmacologic agents make a meaningful contribution
to the treatment of hypertension?
the primary goal of antihypertensive therapy is to
reduce the risks associated with elevated bp. the overall
utility of bp reduction as a therapeutic strategy has been
amply demonstrated in clinical trials documenting signiﬁcant reductions in relevant cardiovascular and renal
end points. extensive experience with antihypertensive
therapies indicates that end point prevention is dependent
ﬁrst and foremost on bp reduction per se. however, it is
also clear that end-point reduction is inﬂuenced in important ways by the pharmacologic mechanism by which bp
reduction is achieved, by ancillary properties of speciﬁc
drugs that affect biologic processes other than bp, and by
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters that
determine the time course and magnitude of bp reduction.
in this paper, we review four new drugs that offer
the possibility of signiﬁcantly advancing the treatment
of hypertension (table 1). the  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd113xxx ,
represents the ﬁrst (orally effective) drug of a new class
and offers a novel pharmacologic approach to raas
inhibition.  xxxd2704xxx  is a beta-blocker that lowers bp by a
well-established mechanism but possesses ancillary pharmacologic properties that hold out the promise of better
end-point reduction compared with other members of its
class.  xxxd1715xxx  is a dihydropyridine calcium channel
blocker that reduces bp by a familiar mechanism but possesses an ultra-short pharmacologic half-life, which may
make it particularly useful for precisely controlling bp in
acute settings. the other new drug reviewed, the endothelin antagonist  xxxd1814xxx , is being developed for use in
individuals with refractory hypertension in whom existing
therapies are often incapable of achieving the degree of bp
control necessary to effect optimal end-point reduction.

 xxxd113xxx 
 xxxd113xxx  is the ﬁrst in a new class of orally effective,
nonpeptide, low-molecular-weight  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors, and
is currently being developed for the treatment of hypertension.  xxxd113xxx  is an extremely potent (inhibitory
concentration of 50% [ic50] = 0.6 nmol/l) and highly
speciﬁc inhibitor of human  xxxg1950xxx . the physiochemical

and low lipophilicity, render it partially resistant to biodegradation by peptidases in the intestinal tract, blood,
and liver. as a result,  xxxd113xxx  exhibits improved oral bioavailability (~2.6%) compared to earlier  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors
[1,2•]. this is an extremely important property, as earlier
agents lacked sufﬁcient oral bioavailability to become
clinically useful antihypertensive drugs [3].
the single- and multiple-dose oral pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd113xxx  have been investigated over a wide range of doses
in healthy subjects. maximum plasma concentrations
occur between 2 and 4 hours after oral administration.
the majority of a single oral dose of  xxxd113xxx  is excreted
in the feces as unchanged drug. in healthy volunteers, urinary excretion of  xxxd113xxx  accounts for only 0.1% to 1.1%
of the administered dose at steady state. with multiple
dosing, the terminal half-life of  xxxd113xxx  is approximately
25 to 30 hours, making it suitable for once-daily administration. in vitro inhibition data indicate that drug
interactions with agents that are metabolically cleared by
cytochrome p450 enzymes are unlikely [1,4].
the ability of oral  xxxd113xxx  to inhibit the raas has
been investigated in a number of mechanistic studies.
nussberger et al. [4] evaluated the effects of four oral
doses of  xxxd113xxx  compared to placebo and the  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitor, enalapril, on
components of the raas in 18 normotensive men. after
single oral doses and 8 days of repeated once-daily dosing,  xxxd113xxx  signiﬁcantly reduced plasma  xxxg1950xxx  activity
(pra) in a dose-dependent fashion. corresponding with
reduction in pra,  xxxd113xxx  caused a signiﬁcant decrease
in plasma levels of both  xxxg99xxx  and ii. although
enalapril reduced  xxxg99xxx  levels to a comparable
degree, its adminstration was associated with a more than
15-fold rise in pra and  xxxg99xxx  levels.
two dose-ranging trials in hypertensive patients have
compared the efﬁcacy and safety of various doses of  xxxd113xxx  to angiotensin-receptor blockers (arbs). in a 4-week
study using ambulatory bp monitoring to evaluate efﬁcacy,
 xxxd113xxx , in doses of 37.5 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg
once-daily, was compared to losartan, 100 mg once-daily.

patients included in the study had off-treatment average
daytime ambulatory systolic bp (sbp) > 140 mm hg. mean
reduction in daytime sbp was 0.4, 5.3, 8.0, and 11.0 mm
hg in the  xxxd113xxx  37.5-mg, 75-mg, 150-mg and 300-mg
groups, respectively.  xxxd113xxx  had no effect on heart rate.
the change in daytime sbp seen with losartan 100 mg was
10.9 mm hg, similar to that observed with  xxxd113xxx  300
mg. both  xxxd113xxx  and losartan provided bp reduction
throughout the 24-hour monitoring period. the adverse
event rates with  xxxd113xxx  were not dose-dependent and
were similar to losartan.
in a larger phase ii study, gradman et al. [5••] randomized 652 patients with hypertension (sitting diastolic
bp ≥ 95 mm hg and < 110 mm hg) to 8 weeks of treatment with once-daily oral doses of  xxxd113xxx  (150, 300, or
600 mg), irbesartan (150 mg), or placebo.  xxxd113xxx  150,
300, and 600 mg reduced mean trough sitting sbp by
10.8, 15.5, and 15.6 mm hg, respectively, compared with
a 5.1-mm hg reduction in the placebo group (p < .001)
and a 12.5-mm hg reduction with irbesartan. the
effects of  xxxd113xxx  on bp were dose-dependent, but only
up to the 300-mg dose. the trough-to-peak ratios for
 xxxd113xxx  150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg were 0.63, 0.74,
and 0.78. the incidence of adverse events during  xxxd113xxx  treatment was similar to placebo and irbesartan. the
incidence of diarrhea in patients receiving  xxxd113xxx  600
mg (6.9%) was greater than its occurrence in the other
treatment groups.
several studies have evaluated the mechanistic aspects
of combined raas blockade with  xxxd113xxx  and arbs. in
a crossover study, azizi et al. [2•] examined the effects
of placebo,  xxxd113xxx  (300 mg),  xxxd3487xxx  (160 mg), and
a low-dose combination ( xxxd113xxx  150 mg +  xxxd3487xxx 
80 mg) in 12 normotensive men. subjects were sodiumdepleted to activate the raas. as monotherapy,  xxxd113xxx 
decreased pra, and  xxxd3487xxx  increased pra as well as
circulating levels of  xxxg99xxx  and ii. in the combination arm, pra and  xxxg99xxx  and ii levels remained
the same as placebo. similar results were reported in an
open-label study [6] of 23 hypertensive patients in whom

new drugs for hypertension: what do they offer?

 xxxd113xxx  (150 mg) was added to irbesartan (150 mg).
pra increased 2.4-fold during irbesartan monotherapy
but returned to baseline after  xxxd113xxx  was added. thus,
addition of  xxxd113xxx  eliminated activation of the raas
resulting from arb administration.
 xxxd113xxx , the ﬁrst oral  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor, represents a
potentially important development in antihypertensive
therapy. blockade of the raas with ace inhibitors and
arbs has proven to be a highly effective strategy in the
treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders.  xxxg1950xxx  catalyzes the ﬁrst and rate-limiting step in
the raas physiologic cascade. for this reason,  xxxg1950xxx  has
long been viewed as the preferred pharmacologic target
for raas inhibition as it offers the potential for blocking
this complex hormonal system at its initial point of activation. studies to date have established that  xxxd113xxx  is a
potent inhibitor of  xxxg1950xxx , that its antihypertensive potency
is approximately equivalent to that of the arbs, and that
it exhibits a similar side-effect proﬁle. these properties
alone make it a promising antihypertensive agent.
the larger question relates to the ability of  xxxd113xxx 
to reduce cardiovascular end points compared with other
inhibitors of the raas. ace inhibitors and arbs promote raas activation even as they produce downstream
suppression of its physiologic effects. like many hormonal
systems, the raas is self-regulating and controlled by
negative feedback inhibition. stimulation of the  xxxg99xxx  type 1 (at1) receptor by  xxxg99xxx  reduces renal
 xxxg1950xxx  release. both ace inhibitors and arbs interfere
with this negative feedback loop. when an ace inhibitor is administered, the initial reduction in  xxxg99xxx 
levels stimulates a compensatory augmentation in  xxxg1950xxx 
release. the rise in pra leads to an accumulation of the
ace substrate,  xxxg99xxx , and this contributes to the
phenomenon of “ace escape,” which leads to the near
restoration of pretreatment  xxxg99xxx  levels. when an
arb is administered, reduction of  xxxg99xxx  binding
to the  xxxg100xxx  also causes  xxxg1950xxx  release and a marked
increase in circulating  xxxg99xxx  levels. it is possible
that the raas activation produced by ace inhibitors
and arbs limits their effectiveness.
unlike ace inhibitors and arbs,  xxxd113xxx  blocks the
raas without inducing a compensatory increase in pra,
 xxxg99xxx , or  xxxg99xxx  (table 2). it, therefore, has
the potential to more completely suppress the raas when
used either alone or in combination with other raas
blockers. the possibilities inherent in the latter approach
are illustrated by studies documenting that co-administration of  xxxd113xxx  with an arb blocks the expected increase
in pra and  xxxg99xxx  and ii levels. it is a reasonable
hypothesis that combination therapy with  xxxd113xxx  and
an arb or ace inhibitor could result in better long-term
end-organ protection than can be achieved by an arb or
ace inhibitor alone.
the high speciﬁcity of  xxxd113xxx  for human  xxxg1950xxx 
has made it difﬁcult to conduct end-organ studies in

conventional animal models. amelioration of targetorgan damage has been reported in double transgenic
mice (dtgr), which express both the human  xxxg1950xxx  and
 xxxg99xxx  genes [7]. there are as yet no studies
evaluating the effectiveness of  xxxd113xxx  compared to or in
conjunction with other raas blockers in achieving target-organ protection.

 xxxd2704xxx 

 xxxd2704xxx  is a third-generation, beta-adrenergic–blocking
agent with vasodilator properties.  xxxd2704xxx  is cardioselective, demonstrating very high afﬁnity for the  xxxg836xxx 
receptor and a 50-fold lower afﬁnity for  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  receptors [8].
the drug is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, dand l- xxxd2704xxx  [9]. the  xxxg836xxx  blocking activity of the agent
resides in d- xxxd2704xxx , which shows a more than 100-fold
greater afﬁnity for  xxxg836xxx  receptors compared to l- xxxd2704xxx .
the latter, however, is responsible for the apparently
unique vasodilatory properties of the agent that are not
mediated by blockade of alpha-adrenergic or stimulation of
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptors [10].
the property that distinguishes  xxxd2704xxx  from other
beta-blocking agents (with the possible exception of carvedilol) is its ability to effect vasodilation in both arteries
and veins via the l-arginine/ xxxd2738xxx  (no) pathway
[11]. in humans,  xxxd2704xxx  has been shown to produce
endothelial-dependent, no-mediated vasodilation in
both normotensive and hypertensive subjects [12]. in
eight patients with essential hypertension, dawes et al.
[13] administered  xxxd2704xxx  as an intrabrachial artery
infusion. the result was an increase in forearm blood
ﬂow (fbf) of approximately 60%. co-administration
of the no synthase (nos) inhibitor ng-monomethyl
l-arginine ( xxxd3291xxx ) markedly antagonized this effect,
conﬁrming that  xxxd2704xxx -induced vasodilation was the
result of activation of the l-arginine/no pathway. in a
fascinating in vitro study recently reported by mason
et al. [14••],  xxxd2704xxx  not only normalized the level
of bioavailable no in endothelial cells derived from
black patients (an ethnic subgroup exhibiting an apparent deﬁciency in no generation in the vasculature) but
also reversed  xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx  (enos) uncoupling and

improved its function.  xxxd2704xxx  has also been reported
to produce systemic antioxidant effects [15].
several studies have compared  xxxd2704xxx  to other
beta-blockers. tzemos et al. [16] conducted a double-blind,
crossover study in which  xxxd2704xxx  5 mg was compared
with atenolol 50 mg in 12 hypertensive patients with a
mean ambulatory bp of 154/97 mm hg. patients also
received 2.5 mg of the diuretic, bendroﬂuazide, during
both treatment periods. although both regimens reduced
bp equally, the vasodilator response to intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine was signiﬁcantly increased when
patients were receiving  xxxd2704xxx  but not atenolol. in
another study [17] in which  xxxd2704xxx  was compared to
the highly  xxxg836xxx  selective agent, bisoprolol, bioimpedence was
used to measure cardiac output and calculate systemic
vascular resistance (svr). a signiﬁcant decrease in svr
occurred following 2 weeks of treatment with  xxxd2704xxx 
but not bisoprolol. when compared with metoprolol,
 xxxd2704xxx  improved oxidative stress and insulin sensitivity,
decreased the plasma concentration of the adhesion molecule, soluble  xxxg2049xxx , and increased adiponectin levels
in hypertensive patients [15]. in an open-label study from
greece, erectile function (which depends on no availability) improved when patients were switched from other
beta-blockers to  xxxd2704xxx  [18].
the hemodynamic properties of  xxxd2704xxx  may also be
important in the treatment of patients with diastolic heart
failure. in a carefully conducted study [19], 26 patients
with hypertension and diastolic heart failure were randomized to receive  xxxd2704xxx  or atenolol for a 6-month
period. follow-up included invasive hemodynamic studies
performed both at rest and with exercise. mean arterial
pressure (map) was reduced to the same extent by both
drugs. consistent with earlier studies, svr at rest was
increased by atenolol and reduced by  xxxd2704xxx . although
no difference in exercise capacity was noted, cardiac
index at peak exercise was reduced by atenolol but not
by  xxxd2704xxx . signiﬁcantly,  xxxd2704xxx -treated patients
exhibited an approximately 20% reduction in pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure both at rest and with exercise .
in the seniors trial [20], 2128 patients older than 70
years of age with either systolic or diastolic heart failure
were randomized to receive  xxxd2704xxx  (10 mg) or placebo.
the primary end point (the composite of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospital admission) was reduced by
16% (p = 0.039) in  xxxd2704xxx -treated patients; the results
did not differ among patients with reduced and preserved
systolic function. the 12% reduction in overall mortality
was not, however, statistically signiﬁcant.
although classically considered to be preferred agents
for the treatment of hypertension, beta-blockers, in particular atenolol, have recently fallen into disfavor, and many
are questioning their suitability as ﬁrst-line drugs. in a
recent meta-analysis, carlberg et al. [21] reported that
atenolol—despite producing effective bp reduction—had
little or no effect on the incidence of myocardial infarction

and cardiovascular mortality, and only a marginal effect
on stroke rate compared with placebo. in two recent megatrials, a calcium channel blocker and an arb produced
superior end-point reduction compared to atenolol [22].
endothelial dysfunction is now recognized as a critical pathophysiologic precursor to the development of
atherosclerosis and its complications. the essential element of endothelial dysfunction is no deﬁciency. a large
and growing body of evidence supports the concept that
no, in addition to its role in facilitating normal vasodilatory responses, protects the vasculature from a variety
of insults including smooth muscle cell migration and
proliferation, endothelial adhesion of leukocytes, platelet
aggregation, and thrombosis. it is an unproved, but plausible, hypothesis that the lack of effect of most beta-blockers
in normalizing the endothelial dysfunction present in
hypertensive patients is a factor in the relatively poor performance of beta-blockers in long-term hypertension trials.
despite the controversy regarding their efﬁcacy as
ﬁrst-line antihypertensive therapy, the salutary effects of
beta-blockers in many patient populations, particularly those
with coronary artery disease, should not be discounted. betablockers clearly improve survival and reduce re-infarction
and sudden arrhythmic death following acute myocardial
infarction. they reduce myocardial oxygen demand and
are effective anti- xxxd1914xxx  agents. the promise of  xxxd2704xxx 
is that it could be a drug that retains the beneﬁcial properties of beta-blockers while adding the purported vascular
protective effects of improved no availability and endothelial function to them. large-scale clinical trials will be
required to test this hypothesis and determine the place
of  xxxd2704xxx  in the treatment of hypertension. the tantalizing suggestion that no deﬁciency in blacks could be
corrected by  xxxd2704xxx  warrants further study.

 xxxd1715xxx 
 xxxd1715xxx  is a vascular selective dihydropyridine calcium
channel blocker that is structurally related to  xxxd2092xxx  [23].
it is currently under development as an intravenous agent for
use in controlling bp in the perioperative setting. the novel
pharmacokinetic properties of this agent include very rapid
clearance and an ultra-short pharmacodynamic duration
of action [24]. after intravenous administration, the drug
is rapidly hydrolyzed to inactive metabolites by esterases in
arterial blood. the distribution and elimination of  xxxd1715xxx 
are best described by a three-compartment model. although
the terminal phase half-life is approximately 21 minutes, the
context-sensitive half-time, deﬁned as the time required for a
50% decrease in blood concentration, is less than 2 minutes
in coronary by-pass patients with hypertension after admission to the postoperative intensive care unit. bp reduction is
directly related to blood concentration, resulting in an agent
with a very rapid onset and offset of effect.
in a dose-ﬁnding study [25], 91 postoperative cardiac surgical patients exhibiting an map > 90 mm hg

were randomized to receive placebo or one of six intravenous doses of  xxxd1715xxx . hemodynamic responses
were recorded, and  xxxd1715xxx  plasma concentrations
were determined during infusion and following drug
discontinuation. map and svr were reduced in a
dose-dependent manner at infusion rates of more than
0.32 mug/kg/min. a  xxxd1715xxx  concentration of 26.3 mug/l
was associated with a 50% probability of attaining a
20% or greater reduction in map, approximately the
magnitude of desired response in this clinical situation.
this concentration corresponds to an infusion rate of
approximately 1.4 mug/kg/min. in this patient population,
many of whom had received beta-blocking agents,  xxxd1715xxx  administration was not associated with a reﬂex
increase in heart rate or any change in cardiac index.
in another study [26],  xxxd1715xxx  compared favorably to
sodium nitroprusside in a similar patient population. heart
rate increased less in patients given  xxxd1715xxx  compared to
those receiving nitroprusside, and stroke volume was signiﬁcantly reduced by nitroprusside but not by  xxxd1715xxx .
hypertension is commonly encountered during the
perioperative period in patients undergoing coronary
bypass or other surgical procedures. even bp elevations
that are not normally classiﬁed as “hypertension” may be
undesirable for several reasons. in patients with reduced
left ventricular systolic function, increases in bp may
degrade ventricular performance and precipitate heart
failure. increased ﬁlling pressures may provoke subendocardial ischemia in susceptible patients, and acute bp
elevation may exacerbate bleeding from surgical sites. the
mechanisms responsible for the hypertensive response
include pain, hypervolemia, activation of the raas due
to the lack of pulsatile blood ﬂow through the kidneys
during cardiopulmonary bypass, and increased activity of
the sympathetic nervous system.
traditionally, these patients have been treated with
short-acting direct vasodilators alone or in combination
with beta-blockers. among the most popular drugs are the
nitrovasodilators, sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin,
and esmolol, a beta-blocker with a short elimination half-life
(9 minutes). potential limitations in the use of nitroprusside include the accumulation of cyanate in patients with
decreased effective glomerular ﬁltration rate and the
possibility of precipitating ischemia through a coronary
steal phenomenon. stroke volume and cardiac output may
be reduced in patients receiving either nitroprusside or
nitroglycerin as a result of their venodilatory properties.
beta-blockade may be undesirable in patients with reduced
systolic function, acute bronchospasm, and/or a history of
bronchial hyperreactivity. other available agents include
intravenous hydralazine and  xxxd2097xxx , both of which
cause reﬂex tachycardia.
rapid onset and offset of bp reduction are desirable properties for drugs used in acute clinical settings.
because of its favorable pharmacokinetic properties,
 xxxd1715xxx  would appear to have signiﬁcant advan-

tages compared with the other available intravenous
dihydropyridine calcium antagonist,  xxxd2718xxx . like
 xxxd1715xxx ,  xxxd2718xxx  is a vascular selective agent that
is arterial-speciﬁc and is not associated with myocardial
depression or signiﬁcant reﬂex tachycardia. however,
the effects of  xxxd2718xxx  are not readily reversible
due to the fact that the time required for blood concentration to fall by 50% after drug discontinuation
is approximately 2 hours. the two drugs will be compared directly in the upcoming evaluation of  xxxd1715xxx 
in the postoperative treatment of hypertension assessing safety events.  xxxd1715xxx  could also prove useful
in a number of other clinical circumstances (including
the cardiac catheterization laboratory) in which rapid
control of bp is required.

 xxxd1814xxx 
 xxxd1814xxx  is a new endothelin-receptor antagonist
that produces selective blockade of the endothelin a
(eta) receptor [27].  xxxg674xxx  is a biologically active
peptide that exerts diverse effects on the vasculature
through stimulation of eta and et b receptors. acting at
the  xxxg676xxx , endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor
that, like  xxxg99xxx  and norepinephrine, promotes
vascular smooth muscle cell growth and hypertrophy. in
contrast, activation of the et b receptor results in vasodilation and the release of no [28]. the ﬁrst generation
of endothelin-receptor antagonists, of which  xxxd358xxx 
is the prototype, produces nonspeciﬁc blockade of both
eta and et b receptors.
in a population of 392 hypertensives with a mean
baseline bp of 168/103 mm hg,  xxxd1814xxx  was compared with placebo in a randomized, double-blind,
parallel-group, dose-ranging study [29].  xxxd1814xxx 
signiﬁcantly reduced both systolic and diastolic bp in a
dose-dependent manner. compared with placebo, administration of the 100-mg dose once daily resulted in a mean
bp reduction of 11.3/8.3 mm hg (p < 0.0001). there was
no effect of  xxxd1814xxx  on heart rate. the most important
drug-related adverse events were ﬂushing and peripheral
edema, both of which increased in a dose-dependent fashion in the active treatment groups. at the 100-mg dose of
 xxxd1814xxx , ﬂushing was observed in 9.4% and edema in
7.3% of participants.
in a recent study that has been reported only in
abstract form [30], the use of  xxxd1814xxx  as add-on therapy
was evaluated in 115 subjects with hypertension that was
uncontrolled (sbp > 140 mm hg) despite a treatment
regimen consisting of more than three antihypertensive
agents, including a diuretic. starting at a dose of 10 mg
once daily, the dose of  xxxd1814xxx  was increased at
2-week intervals in all patients to a maximum dose of
300 mg. at week 10 of  xxxd1814xxx  treatment, the placebocorrected change from baseline sbp (the primary end point)
was –11.6 ± 3.3 mm hg (p = 0.02) and –5.8 ± 2.3 mm hg

430 antihypertensive therapy: renal injury

(p = 0.004) for dbp. the proportion of patients achieving
jnc 7 sbp goals was 49% in  xxxd1814xxx -treated patients.
there were no serious adverse events reported and no
signiﬁcant elevations of hepatic transaminases. peripheral
edema was, however, reported in 17.3% of darusentantreated patients.
with the exception of primary pulmonary hypertension, the endothelin-receptor antagonists have shown
mixed results in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.  xxxd358xxx  was previously shown to reduce bp
in hypertensive patients to a similar degree as enalapril but with a less favorable side effect proﬁle [31]. in
heart failure patients, neither  xxxd358xxx  nor tezosentan
reduced relevant clinical end points [32]. in a series of
642 patients [33] with chronic heart failure,  xxxd1814xxx  in doses up to 300 mg once daily had no effect on
symptoms, exercise tolerance, or end-diastolic volume
compared to placebo and does not appear to be a useful
treatment. the relatively unfavorable side-effect proﬁle
of  xxxd1814xxx  makes it unlikely to become a ﬁrst-line
agent for the treatment of hypertension.
nevertheless,  xxxd1814xxx  has potential for use in
patients with resistant hypertension. resistant hypertension is defined by jnc 7 as the failure to achieve
goal bp in patients who are adhering to full doses of an
appropriate three-drug regimen that includes a diuretic
[34]. clearly, patients with resistant hypertension have
an adverse prognosis compared to patients in whom
bp control can be achieved. the real prevalence of
“resistant” or “refractory” hypertension varies in the
literature due to differences in definition but probably
constitutes 10% to 20% of the hypertensive population as traditionally defined (bp > 140/90 mm hg)
[35–37]. with the lower definition of hypertension
in diabetics and patients with renal disease, the proportion of patients classified as refractory to therapy
has increased. it may well increase further if, as seems
likely, target bp is lowered in other patient subgroups
who have been determined to be at increased global
risk for cardiovascular events.
experience indicates that combinations of drugs
that work by different pharmacologic mechanisms are
more likely to produce additive bp reduction compared
to combinations that include drugs acting by similar
or overlapping mechanisms. the endothelin system is
a distinct and important physiologic regulator of bp.
in the study of patients with refractory hypertension
cited earlier, selective blockade of the vasoconstricting  xxxg676xxx  with  xxxd1814xxx  produced significant
bp reduction and led to the ability to reach target bp
in almost 50% of patients with very difficult-to-treat
hypertension. despite its somewhat unfavorable sideeffect profile, this would appear to make it a potentially
valuable addition to existing therapies. additional
studies are needed.

conclusions
a new drug for hypertension may make a positive contribution to existing treatments in a number of ways. it
may reduce bp by a novel pharmacologic mechanism that
offers the possibility of improved end-point reduction
when given alone or in combination with other agents.
the introduction of the beta-blockers and ace inhibitors
serve as classic examples of this type of breakthrough. the
development of the oral  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors, of which  xxxd113xxx  is the prototype, could prove to be such a therapeutic
advance. currently, it is clear that  xxxd113xxx  is an effective
drug for reducing bp with potency and side-effect proﬁle
similar to arbs.
a useful new drug may use an established pharmacologic approach but possess ancillary properties
that improve efﬁcacy, correct deﬁciencies, or prevent
adverse events associated with other members of its
class. the development of the long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) and a
comparison to the prototype of its class, (short-acting)
nifedipine, illustrates this type of improvement. although
previous experience dictates caution in extrapolating
pharmacologic mechanisms to clinical outcomes, it is
conceivable that  xxxd2704xxx , with its vasodilatory properties based on increased no availability, could produce a
similar result for the beta-blockers.
the contrast between amlodipine and short-acting
nifedipine also illustrates the importance of pharmacokinetics in determining the utility of an antihypertensive
agent. the ultra-short pharmacodynamic half-life of
 xxxd1715xxx  could add the potent bp-lowering effects of
calcium channel blockade to the armamentarium for
clinicians treating bp elevation in acute settings.
an additional way in which a new drug might
favorably impact therapeutics would be to permit more
effective bp control in an individual patient or patient
population in which achievement of optimal bp is not
possible with existing treatments. there are a signiﬁcant
number of patients in whom bp cannot be effectively
controlled, despite administration of multiple agents.
the selective endothelin-receptor antagonist,  xxxd1814xxx , reduces bp by acting on a physiologic system that
has not previously been the target of oral antihypertensive therapy. although its application will probably be
limited, it could prove useful in achieving bp control in
patients who are truly resistant to currently available
drugs and drug combinations.
