abstract
although trastuzumab has been successfully used in patients with
her2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer, resistance is a
common problem that ultimately culminates in treatment failure. in
light of the importance of akt signaling in trastuzumab’s antitumor
action, we hypothesized that concurrent inhibition of akt could
enhance trastuzumab sensitivity and moreover reverse the resistant phenotype in her2-positive breast cancer cells. based on
our finding that celecoxib mediates antitumor effects through the
inhibition of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (pdk-1)/akt
signaling independently of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2), we used
celecoxib as a scaffold to develop a cox-2-inactive pdk-1 inhibitor, 2-amino-n-[4-[5-(2-phenanthrenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1hpyrazol-1-yl]phenyl]- xxxd63xxx  (osu-03012). here, we investigated the effect of osu-03012 on trastuzumab-mediated
apoptosis in four breast cancer cell lines with different her2
expression and trastuzumab-resistance status, including mda-

trastuzumab (herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the extracellular domain of the  xxxg2198xxx 
receptor her2, has been used in combination chemotherapy

mb-231, bt474, skbr3, and insulin-like growth factor-i receptoroverexpressing skbr3 (skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx ). effects of trastuzumab
and osu-03012, individually or in combination, on cell viability
and changes in pertinent biomarkers including her2 expression,
phosphorylation of akt,  xxxg419xxx , and the pdk-1 substrate p70s6k
were assessed. osu-03012 alone was able to trigger apoptosis
in all cell lines with equal potency (ic50 ⫽ 3– 4 ␮m), suggesting
no cross-resistance with trastuzumab. medium dose-effect
analysis indicates that osu-03012 potentiated trastuzumab’s
antiproliferative effect in her2-positive cells, especially in
skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells, through the down-regulation of pdk-1/akt
signaling. this synergy, however, was not observed in her2negative mda-mb-231 cells. this combination treatment represents a novel strategy to increase the efficacy of trastuzumab
and to overcome trastuzumab resistance in the treatment of
her2-positive breast cancer.

for the treatment of her2-overexpressing metastatic breast
cancer, an aggressive form of the disease with poor prognosis.
more recently, the results of three large adjuvant trials demonstrate that trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy significantly increased disease-free survival for women
with early-stage her2-positive breast cancer. despite these
advances, the clinical benefit of trastuzumab is compromised
by the facts that not all her2-overexpressing cancers respond clinically to the treatment and that some breast can-

overcoming trastuzumab resistance by osu-03012

materials and methods
cell culture and reagents. we used the following four breast
cancer cell lines to assess the impact of the pdk-1 inhibitor osu03012 on the sensitivity to the antiproliferative action of trastuzumab: low her2-expressing mda-mb-231, her2-positive bt474,
skbr3, and her2-positive and trastuzumab-resistant skbr3/
 xxxg1145xxx  (lu et al., 2001). cells were grown in 75-cm2 plastic tissue
culture flasks at 37°c in a humidified incubator in dulbecco’s minimal essential medium/ham’s f-12 (dmem/f12; 1:1) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs; invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), and
10 ␮g/ml gentamicin (sigma, st. louis, mo) at 37°c in 5% co2. cells

were passaged at 1:4 dilution with fresh medium once every 4 days.
trastuzumab, also known as herceptin (genentech inc., san francisco, ca), was obtained from the ohio state university hospital
pharmacy. the pdk-1 inhibitor osu-03012 was synthesized as described previously (zhu et al., 2004). mouse monoclonal anti-poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) was purchased from cell signaling
technology inc. (beverly, ma). rabbit antibodies against her2,
phospho-thr308-akt, akt, and  xxxg419xxx , and the mouse antibody
against p70s6k were obtained from santa cruz biotechnology, inc.
(santa cruz, ca). rabbit anti-phospho-thr229-p70s6k and anti-phospho-thr157-p27 were from r&d systems inc. (minneapolis, mn).
mouse monoclonal antiactin was purchased from mp biomedicals
inc. (irvine, ca). goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse igg-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were from jackson immunoresearch
laboratories (west grove, pa).
cell viability assay. cell viability was analyzed by the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide (mtt)
assay (tci america; portland, or) in six replicates. cells (3000)
were grown in 10% fbs-supplemented dmem/f12 medium in 96well, flat-bottomed plates and were exposed to various concentrations of individual agents or combination of drugs dissolved in dmso
(final concentration, ⱕ0.1%) in the same medium. control groups
received dmso vehicle at a concentration equal to that in drugtreated cells. after 72-h treatment, medium was removed and replaced by 200 ␮l of mtt (0.5 mg/ml) in dmem/f12 medium, and
cells were incubated in the co2 incubator at 37°c for 3 h. after
discarding the mtt solution, the reduced mtt dye was solubilized
with 200 ␮l/well dmso and was analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm in a plate reader. the ic50 value, which represents
the drug concentration required for 50% growth inhibition, was
calculated with the calcusyn software (biosoft, cambridge, uk) by
using the median-effect method (chou and talalay, 1984).
immunoblotting. the general procedure for the western blot
analysis was performed as follows. cells were scratched from culture
flasks and collected by centrifugation at 2000g and resuspended in
ripa lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 150 mm
nacl, 1 mm edta, 1% triton x-100, 1% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 0.1%
sds, and a mixture of protease inhibitor cocktail (calbiochem, la
jolla, ca) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 ␮m sodium fluoride, 5 ␮m
sodium vanadate, and 10 ␮m ␤-glycerol phosphate). the mixture
was sonicated for 5 s, and protein contents were analyzed by using
the bradford assay kit (bio-rad, hercules, ca). fifty micrograms of
total proteins was resolved in sds-polyacrylamide gels on a minigel
apparatus and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a
semidry transfer cell. after blocking with tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% tween 20 (tbst) and 5% nonfat milk for 60 min, the
membrane was incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at
1:1000 dilution in tbst-1% nonfat milk at 4°c overnight and
washed three times with tbst. the membrane was probed with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:3000
for 1 h at room temperature and washed with tbst three times. the
immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.
western blot analysis of parp cleavage. drug-treated cells
for 72 h were collected, washed with ice-cold pbs, and resuspended
in the aforementioned ripa lysis buffer. soluble cell lysates were
collected after centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000g for 5 min. equivalent
amounts of proteins (50 ␮g) from each lysate were resolved in 10%
sds-polyacrylamide gels. bands were transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes and analyzed by immunoblotting.
analysis of dna fragmentation by elisa. induction of apoptosis was assessed with a cell death detection elisa kit (roche
diagnostics, indianapolis, in) following the manufacturer’s instruction. this test is based on the quantitative determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated dna fragments in the form of mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes after induced apoptotic death. in
brief, 1 ⫻ 106 cells were exposed to individual treatments in a t-25
flask in 10% fbs-supplemented dmem/f12 medium for 72 h. both

cers develop resistance to this molecularly targeted drug
after initial response. evidence indicates that trastuzumab
mediates antiproliferative effects in her2-positive cells by
facilitating her2 degradation (yarden, 2001), down-regulation of phosphatidylinsitol 3-kinase (pi3k)/akt signaling
(clark et al., 2002), and increases in the expression of the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  xxxg419xxx . therefore, her2positive breast cancer cells are able to evade the antiproliferative action of trastuzumab by adopting mechanisms to
counter these antiproliferative mechanisms (hynes and
lane, 2005), including up-regulation of insulin-like growth
factor-i receptor ( xxxg1145xxx ) expression (lu et al., 2001), loss of
pten function (nagata et al., 2004), and down-regulation of
the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor  xxxg419xxx  expression (nahta et al., 2004). in light of the important role of akt
signaling in the antitumor action of trastuzumab (yakes et
al., 2002), these mechanistic findings provide a rationale for
the use of an akt signaling inhibitor to enhance the sensitivity to trastuzumab and, more important, to overcome trastuzumab resistance (arteaga, 2003; nagata et al., 2004).
on the basis of our finding that the  xxxg1884xxx 
(cox-2) inhibitor celecoxib mediates apoptosis in cancer
cells, in part, by blocking phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (pdk-1)/akt signaling independently of cox-2 inhibition, we have used celecoxib as a scaffold to develop a novel
class of pdk-1 inhibitors devoid of cox-2 activity (zhu et al.,
2004). the novel compound osu-03012 exhibits high potency
in deactivating akt and inducing apoptosis at low micromolar concentrations in cancer cells through pdk-1 inhibition.
because pdk-1 is a proximal mediator of pi3k signals,
pdk-1 inhibitors target a large portion of the pi3k/akt pathway and can potentially offer an effective treatment (crowder and ellis, 2005). this celecoxib-derived pdk-1 inhibitor
has been demonstrated to be effective in inhibiting the proliferation of a panel of breast cancer cell lines (kucab et al.,
2005) and is currently undergoing preclinical testing under
the rapid access to intervention development program at
the national cancer institute.
we hypothesized that concurrent inhibition of pdk-1/akt
signaling would sensitize her2-positive breast cancer cells,
even those with the resistant phenotype, to trastuzumab’s
antiproliferative effect. a similar strategy has been used to
overcome  xxxd2333xxx  resistance in bcr-abl mutant
cell lines (tseng et al., 2005). here, we demonstrate that
osu-03012 interacted synergistically with trastuzumab to
enhance cell killing in two her2-positive breast cancer cells
(bt474 and skbr3) and to reverse the resistant phenotype
in skbr3 cells that overexpress  xxxg1145xxx  (skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx ).
this synergistic effect, however, was not observed in mdamb-231 cells that lack her2 expression.

sensitive to trastuzumab because of lack of her2 expression.
exposure of her2-overexpressing bt474 and skbr3 cells to
trastuzumab caused a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation, which leveled off at the maximum cell reduction of
approximately 50% (fig. 1b, left). however, skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx 
cells acquired a resistant phenotype as a result of  xxxg1145xxx 
overexpression (lu et al., 2001). despite the discrepancy in
trastuzumab sensitivity, these four cell lines were equally
susceptible to the antiproliferative effect of osu-03012, indicating a lack of cross-resistance to osu-03012 in trastuzumab-resistant skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells (fig. 1b, right). the
respective ic50 values were the following: mda-mb-231,
3.8 ⫾ 0.4 ␮m; bt474, 3.9 ⫾ 0.4 ␮m; skbr3, 3.0 ⫾ 0.2 ␮m;
and skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx , 3.2 ⫾ 0.1 ␮m.
to shed light onto the mechanism responsible for this
differential response, we examined the effects of trastuzumab and osu-03012 on the expression and/or phosphorylation status of a number of pertinent signaling markers in
individual cell lines. these biomarkers included her2, akt,
the cdk inhibitor  xxxg419xxx , and the  xxxg1718xxx  substrate p70s6k.
 xxxg419xxx  is known to be phosphorylated by akt, which impairs
the nuclear import and action of this cdk inhibitor (liang et
al., 2002). in bt474 and skbr3 cells, trastuzumab caused a
dose-dependent decrease in her2 expression, accompanied
by increased  xxxg419xxx  expression and decreased phosphorylation of akt,  xxxg419xxx , and, to a lesser extent, p70s6k (fig. 2).
none of these effects, however, was noted in low her2expressing mda-mb-231 or trastuzumab-resistant skbr3/
 xxxg1145xxx  cells within the dose range examined, underlying the
lack of antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab in these two
cell lines.

these four different breast cancer cell lines exhibited distinct
molecular characteristics, which underlie differences in the
respective sensitivity to trastuzumab’s antiproliferative effects (fig. 1). among them, mda-mb-231 cells lacked her2
expression, whereas bt474, skbr3, and skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx 
cells displayed high abundance of her2 (fig. 1a). moreover,
skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells showed ectopic  xxxg1145xxx  overexpression.

floating and adherent cells were collected; cell lysates equivalent to
5 ⫻ 105 cells were used in the elisa.
flow cytometric analysis. fluorescein-conjugated  xxxg166xxx 
and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi) were used to quantify the percentage of
cells undergoing apoptosis by following the protocol by the manufacturer (molecular probes, eugene, or). in short, after exposure to
trastuzumab with or without osu-03012 in 10% fbs-supplemented
dmem/f12 medium for 24 h, cells were collected and resuspended in
1 ml of binding buffer (10 mm hepes, ph 7.4, 140 mm nacl, and 2.5
mm cacl2) at a concentration of 5 ⫻ 106 cells/ml. a 200-␮l solution
was transferred to a culture tube, to which were added fluoresceinconjugated  xxxg166xxx  and pi. the cells were gently vortexed and
incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. an additional
800 ␮l of binding buffer was added to each tube, and the samples
were analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter.
immunocytochemical analysis. skbr and skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx 
cells were treated with 5 ␮m osu-03012 in 10% fbs-supplemented
dmem/f12 medium for 24 h, washed with dulbecco’s pbs, fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and
then washed with pbs. the fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1%
triton x-100 in 1% fbs-containing pbs, stained with her2 antibodies at 1:100 dilution (santa cruz biotechnology) for 24 h at 4°c,
and treated with alexa fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit igg (molecular
probes) in the aforementioned pbs for conjugation. the nuclear
counter staining was performed using a 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing mounting medium (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca) before examination. images of immunocytochemically
labeled samples were observed using a zeiss confocal microscope
(lsm510; carl zeiss inc., thornwood, ny) with an argon laser and a
helium-neon laser and appropriate filters (excitation wavelength,
633 nm for her2 and 543 nm for 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).
statistical analysis. each experiment was performed in triplicate. all experiments were carried out at least two times on different
occasions. the medium-effect method was used to analyze doseresponse data for single or multiple drugs. the synergistic effect of
multiple drugs was determined by the definition of chou and talalay
(1984). cells were treated with series dilution of trastuzumab and
osu-03012 at fixed concentration ratios. the concentration of trastuzumab ranged from 1 to 10 ␮g/ml, whereas that of osu-03012 was
0.5 to 5 ␮m. these two drugs were assumed as totally independent
modes of action and were therefore mutually nonexclusive. by using
the software package calcusyn (biosoft, cambridge, uk), the values
of combination index (ci) were calculated. the values of ci at different levels of growth inhibition were calculated based on the formula for mutually nonexclusive mechanism: (d1/dx1) ⫹ (d2/dx2) ⫹
(d1d2/dxldx2), where dx1 and dx2 are the doses of drug 1 and drug 2
alone required to produce x percentage effect, and d1 and d2 are the
doses of drug 1 and drug 2 in combination required to produce the
same effect. the ci values less than 1, equal to 1, and greater than
1 are indicative of synergism, additive effect, and antagonism, respectively.

overcoming trastuzumab resistance by osu-03012

suggests a link between receptor internalization and her2
down-regulation. the underlying mechanism is currently under investigation.
osu-03012 restores the sensitivity of skbr/ xxxg1145xxx 
cells to trastuzumab’s antiproliferative effect. in light
of the important role of akt in the antitumor action of trastuzumab, we hypothesized that concurrent inhibition of
pdk-1/akt signaling by osu-03012 could sensitize trastuzumab-resistant cells to the residual antiproliferative activity of this antibody. to test this hypothesis, mda-mb-231,
bt474, skbr3, and skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells were exposed to
varying concentrations of trastuzumab in the presence of 2.5
or 5 ␮m osu-03012 versus dmso control for 72 h. figure 4
demonstrates the ability of osu-03012 to improve the sensitivity of her2-overexpressing cells to trastuzumab-induced cell death. for example, 10 ␮g/ml trastuzumab and 2.5
␮m osu-03012 alone caused approximately 25 and 30%,
respectively, cell reduction in bt474 and skbr3 cells, and
the combination of these two agents could achieve 65% cell
death. especially noteworthy, osu-03012 was able to overcome the resistant phenotype in skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells. although trastuzumab alone at concentrations lower than 50
␮g/ml was ineffective in inhibiting skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cell proliferation, osu-03012 restored the sensitivity of these resistant cells to trastuzumab’s antiproliferative effects to an

osu-03012 induces apoptosis through pdk-1 inhibition irrespective of her2 expression levels and resistant phenotype. osu-03012 was able to trigger apoptosis in all four cell lines at low micromolar concentrations
irrespective of the her2 expression status and resistant
phenotype, as evidenced by parp cleavage (fig. 2). as
shown, exposure of these four different types of cells to osu03012 caused dose-dependent decreases in the phosphorylation levels of akt,  xxxg419xxx , and p70s6k. moreover, the extent
of dephosphorylation in these biomarkers in trastuzumabinsensitive mda-mb-231 and skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells was in
line with that of bt474 and skbr3 cells, suggesting that
this apoptosis induction was, at least in part, attributable to
the ability of osu-03012 to down-regulate pdk-1/akt signaling. in contrast to trastuzumab, osu-03012 has no effect
on  xxxg419xxx  expression. nevertheless, this pdk-1 inhibitor
was able to repress her2 expression in a manner similar to
that of trastuzumab (fig. 2). this osu-03012-mediated
her2 down-regulation was reminiscent of the effect of the
hsp90 inhibitor  xxxd2187xxx  and its analogs on her2 degradation (zheng et al., 2000). immunocytochemical analysis
indicates that osu-03012 decreased the cell surface expression of her2 and facilitated the internalization of the receptor in both skbr3 and skbr/ xxxg1145xxx  cells, which was also
noted with the pi3k inhibitor  xxxd2523xxx  (fig. 3). this finding

a combination of 5 and 10 ␮g/ml trastuzumab with 5 ␮m
osu-03012 led to 60 and 89%, respectively, apoptotic death.
a similar finding was also noted with the  xxxg1145xxx -overexpressing skbr3 cells (bottom).
to demonstrate that there existed synergism between
these two drugs, we carried out the medium dose analysis of
the combined effect of osu-03012 and trastuzumab at a fixed
ratio on cell viability according to the median-effect method
(chou and talalay, 1984). figure 6a depicts the dose-response curves of these four cell lines after 72-h treatment of
five different dose combinations of trastuzumab (nanomolar)/
osu-03012 (micromolar) at a fixed ratio (7/0.5, 14/1, 28/2,
42/3, 56/4, and 70/5; f) versus varying concentrations of
trastuzumab (e) and osu-03012 (‚) alone. these dose-response data were used to determine ci values in relation to
the fraction affected (fig. 6b). with the exception of mdamb-231, the other three cell lines exhibited ci values all
lower than 1, which was indicative of synergism between
trastuzumab and osu-03012 in her2-overexpressing cells.
for example, the ci values calculated for the combination
treatment that caused 50% cell death (fractional effect, 0.5)
were 0.96, 0.50, 0.71, and 0.68 for mda-mb-231, bt474,
skbr3, and skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells, respectively.
osu-03012 overcomes trastuzumab resistance in
skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells by antagonizing the protective
effect of  xxxg1145xxx  overexpression on trastuzumab-mediated her2 repression, akt dephosphorylation, and
 xxxg419xxx  up-regulation. from a mechanistic perspective,
osu-03102-mediated sensitization of skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells to
trastuzumab could be accounted for by the ability of this
pdk-1/akt signaling inhibitor to counter the protective effect
of  xxxg1145xxx  overexpression on critical aspects of signal transduction pertinent to trastuzumab’s antiproliferative activity,
including her2 expression, akt phosphorylation, and
 xxxg419xxx  phosphorylation and expression (fig. 7). in all three
her2-overexpressing cell lines, the extent of changes in
these biomarkers by the combination treatment seemed to be

extent similar to that of the parent cell line skbr3 (fig. 4a).
this sensitizing effect, however, was not noted in the low
her2-expressing mda-mb-231 cells.
we used skbr3 and skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells to obtain evidence
that the chemosensitizing effect of osu-03012 was attributable
to its ability to enhance the susceptibility of these her2overexpressing cells to trastuzumab-induced apoptosis. dna
fragmentation elisa indicates that trastuzumab alone did
not cause appreciable increase in nucleosome formation even
at 20 ␮g/ml. however, in the presence of 5 ␮m osu-03012,
trastuzumab significantly increased the extent of dna fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner (ⴱ, p ⬍ 0.005 compared with 5 ␮m osu-03012 alone) (fig. 5a). the effect of
5 ␮m osu-03012 on sensitizing both cell lines to trastuzumab-induced apoptosis was also confirmed by the annexin
v/pi staining (fig. 5b). as shown, 10 ␮g/ml trastuzumab and
5 ␮m osu-03012 alone gave rise to 12 and 35%, respectively,
apoptosis compared with 13% for the vehicle control in
skbr3 cells (top). in contrast, treatment of skbr3 cells with

overcoming trastuzumab resistance by osu-03012

greater than the addition of individual effects. for example,
trastuzumab alone, within the dose range of 5 to 20 ␮g/ml,
had very little, if any, effects on any of these biomarkers in
skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells. however, it could facilitate the effect of
osu-03012 on her2 degradation, akt dephosphorylation,
and  xxxg419xxx  expression and dephosphorylation in a dosedependent manner. in line with the cell viability data, this
mechanistic synergy was not noted in mda-mb-231 cells.

discussion

a viable strategy to address this resistance issue (pandolfi,
2004).
the present study indicates that concurrent inhibition of
pdk-1 with osu-03012 reverses the trastuzumab-resistant
phenotype in  xxxg1145xxx -overexpressing skbr3 cells. these
trastuzumab-resistant cells exhibited the same susceptibility
to osu-03012 as their parent (skbr3) cells as well as bt474
and mda-mb-231 cells irrespective of the resistance status.
the lack of cross-resistance underscores the functional relevance of targeting pdk-1/akt signaling in trastuzumab-resistant cells. despite the resistant phenotype, trastuzumab
still retains its ability to bind her2 and to activate downstream apoptotic signaling in resistant cells. therefore, osu03012 could sensitize trastuzumab-resistant cells to trastuzumab’s antitumor action through pdk-1 inhibition, as
evidenced by the dephosphorylation of akt,  xxxg419xxx , and
p70s6k. it is noteworthy that western blot analysis indicates
that osu-03012 caused the repression of her2 expression in
a manner similar to that of trastuzumab. immunocytochemical analysis shows that osu-03012 treatment led to her2
internalization in both skbr3 and skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells,
which presumably led to receptor degradation. the effect of

although trastuzumab is useful in treating patients with
her2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer, overcoming
trastuzumab resistance represents an important challenge to
improve patient outcomes. although the mechanisms underlying the acquisition of trastuzumab resistance are not yet
well-defined, recent evidence suggests that her2-positive
cells might develop trastuzumab resistance by raising the
threshold against the antibody’s antiproliferative effect
through the up-regulation of pi3k/akt signaling or downregulation of the cdk inhibitor  xxxg419xxx . thus, combination of
trastuzumab with a pi3k/akt signaling inhibitor represents

factor receptor inhibitor such as gefitinib (iressa; astrazeneca pharmaceuticals lp, wilmington, de) or  xxxd2029xxx 
(tarceva; osi pharmaceuticals, melville, ny) is being evaluated as a strategy to prevent or delay resistance in her2positive patients (miller, 2004). the ability of gefitinib to
enhance the efficacy of trastuzumab has been demonstrated
in several sensitive breast cancer cell systems (moulder et
al., 2001). however, in a phase i trial in patients with pretreated metastatic breast cancer, the combination of trastuzumab and gefitinib was well tolerated but showed poor
antitumor activity.
because pdk-1/akt signaling represents important downstream effectors of many receptor tyrosine kinases, use of the
pdk-1 inhibitor osu-03012 enhances the efficacy in sensitive cells, and, more importantly, restores sensitivity in resistant cells. it is noteworthy that osu-03012 is currently
undergoing preclinical testing under the rapid access to
intervention development program at the national cancer
institute. our data indicate that oral administration of this
agent in tumor-bearing nude mice at 200 mg/kg for 1 month
achieves a peak serum concentration of more than 20 ␮m

osu-03012 on her2 down-regulation is reminiscent of that
of the hsp90 inhibitor  xxxd2187xxx  on her-family tyrosine
kinases((zheng et al., 2000), although the underlying mechanisms might differ. it was speculated that  xxxd2187xxx 
might repress the expression of her kinases through the
disruption of the interaction between hsp90 and the catalytic
domain of her kinases (zheng et al., 2000). we rationale
that the effect of osu-03012 on her2 down-regulation
might be attributable to the inhibition of pdk-1/akt signaling because  xxxd2523xxx  could also achieve a similar effect.
osu-03012’s ability to suppress her2 expression is noteworthy because her2 degradation represents a major mechanism underlying the antiproliferative effect of trastuzumab
and other anti-her2 antibodies (hurwitz et al., 1995;
frankel, 2002). a correlation has been shown between the
effectiveness in her2 down-regulation and the in vivo potency of different anti-her2 antibodies in tumor growth
inhibition (harwerth et al., 1993). reduced her2 at the cell
surface allows less her2 heterodimer formation, resulting in
reduced growth factor-induced signaling and proliferation.

with no apparent toxicity at necropsy (s.k. kulp and c.-s.
chen, unpublished data). our data indicate that low doses of
osu-03012 were able to synergize with trastuzumab in inducing apoptotic death in her2-positive cells.
the potential clinical relevance of the trastuzumab-osu03012 combination is considerable. not only do our data
suggest that the trastuzumab-osu-03012 combination represents a novel strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance,
but the in vitro evidence also suggests that osu-03012 can
increase the efficacy of trastuzumab in her2-positive breast
cancer treatment. the regimen of weekly trastuzumab dosing at 2 mg/kg or every 3-week dosing at 6 mg/kg will achieve
a steady-state serum level of 60 to 80 ␮g/ml (leyland-jones
et al., 2003). in vitro cell viability assays using bt474 and
skbr3 cells indicate that the maximum cell reduction attainable at this range was approximately 50%. however,
trastuzumab in this combination range in combination with
osu-03012 at 2.5 ␮m achieved greater than 90% killing.
recent data provide evidence that development of resistance to trastuzumab in vivo is often associated with increased  xxxg1145xxx  level (cohen and jani, 2005). this
suggests that the skbr3/ xxxg1145xxx  cell line we used may be a
relevant model for at least a subset of spontaneously arising
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancers. we are currently evaluating osu-03012 in combination with trastuzumab in preclinical in vivo animal models. if the results of in vivo testing
are promising, then this combination may represent a viable
