angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers are widely used for the treatment of hypertension, and one
angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker,  xxxd3303xxx , specifically activates the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (ppar)-␥. we studied the impact of ppar␥ mutants on transcriptional control
and interaction with cofactors to elucidate differences in the molecular mechanism between  xxxd3303xxx  and other ppar␥ agonists, thiazolidinediones (tzds). we created several amino acid substitutions in the ligand binding domain of ppar␥ that, based on molecular modeling, may affect
the binding of these agents. in transient expression experiments, wild-type ppar␥-mediated transcription stimulated by  xxxd3303xxx  was more than one third of that stimulated by tzds. the
activation stimulated by tzds was impaired, whereas activation stimulated by  xxxd3303xxx  was
retained, in the h323y, s342a, and h449a mutants. in the y473a mutant, the tzd-induced activation was further impaired and lower than that of  xxxd3303xxx -induced activation. coexpression
of coactivators enhanced the activation by both  xxxd3303xxx  and tzds, but activation by  xxxd3303xxx 
always exceeded that of tzds in the y473a mutant. based on a mammalian two-hybrid assay, the
interaction with corepressors was retained in y473a.  xxxd3303xxx  and tzds, but not 9cis retinoic
acid, dissociated corepressors from the wild-type ppar␥.  xxxd3303xxx  most effectively dissociated
corepressors from y473a. the interaction with coactivators was enhanced by tzd activation of
wild-type ppar␥ and both  xxxd3303xxx  and tzd activation of y473a. thus, the y473a mutant is
selectively stimulated by  xxxd3303xxx  but not tzds, suggesting that  xxxd3303xxx  and tzds have
differential effects on the transcriptional control. in conclusion, these ppar␥ mutants could be
powerful tools for developing novel therapeutic agents that retain the metabolic efficacy of
ppar␥ activation with fewer adverse effects, such as the increase in body weight associated
with tzds. (endocrinology 150: 862– 870, 2009)

ngiotensin-ii receptor blockers (arbs) provide complete
blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (ras) by specifically inhibiting the actions of  xxxg99xxx  at the level of the
angiotensin-ii type 1 receptor (1). because another class of antihypertensive agents targeting the ras, angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors, may cause a  xxxd1861xxx , arbs are increasingly
used for the treatment of hypertension. some arbs are reported
to lower the risk for type 2 diabetes (2– 4) and improve insulin
sensitivity in rodents (5) and humans (6).  xxxd3303xxx  is an arb
that is highly selective for the angiotensin-ii type 1 receptor (7).

recently  xxxd3303xxx  was reported to activate the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)-␥ in transactivation assays (8). the effect of arbs on ppar␥ activation was strongest
for  xxxd3303xxx , followed by irbesartan and losartan. the effects
of  xxxd3487xxx , candesartan, olmesartan, and eprosartan on
ppar␥ activation were minimal (8, 9). another group of ppar␥
ligands, thiazolidinediones (tzds), is a new class of antidiabetic
agents that act as insulin sensitizers, and the different effects of
these drugs suggest that tzds and  xxxd3303xxx  differentially modulate the expression of ppar␥ target genes (9).

a subgroup of the nuclear receptor (nr) superfamily that
includes the receptors for thyroid hormone,  xxxd3417xxx , vitamin d, and ppars form heterodimers with retinoid x receptors (rxrs) to modulate the transcription of genes that
contain hormone response elements (10, 11). these receptors
act as ligand-dependent transcription factors that suppress or
stimulate the expression of target genes (11). transcriptional
stimulation in response to ligand binding of these receptors is
mediated by interactions with coactivator proteins (coas).
based on the ␣-helical lxxll motif within coas, which interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the nrs, coas are classified

ded or antagonist-bound nrs suppress the basal activity of positively regulated promoters by binding to hormone response elements (23–26). two classes of nuclear corepressors (cors),
termed nuclear receptor cor (ncor) (27–29) and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (smrt) (30, 31),
have been identified, and are shown to mediate ligand-independent
repression. these cors assemble a repression complex that includes sin3 and histone deacetylases among other proteins (32–34).
therefore, transcriptional regulation involves chromatin remodeling caused by histone (de)acetylation by swapping these receptor-

crystal structures of the ppar ligand binding domains
(lbds) revealed a large binding pocket, which may explain the
diversity of ppar␥ ligands (35). as a result, ppar␥ may be
activated by a different set of ligands and may exert distinct effects
in vivo. the efficacy of activation may be due to the recruitment
of a different set of cofactors on the receptor. here, based on
molecular modeling information, we picked four amino acids

tsa-201 cells, a clone of human embryonic kidney 293
cells (38), were grown in phenol red-free dmem (nikken
biomedical laboratory, kyoto, japan) with 10% charcoalstripped fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 u/ml), and streptomycin (100 ␮g/ml) and were transfected by the calcium
phosphate method (38). the total amount of expression plasmid dna was kept constant in the different experimental
groups by adding corresponding amounts of the same plasmids without receptor. after exposure to the calcium phosphate-dna precipitate for 8 h, phenol red-free dmem with
10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum was added. cells
were harvested after 40 h for the measurement of luciferase
activity, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (dualluciferase reporter assay system; promega, madison, wi). the
transfection efficiencies were corrected with the internal

western blotting
nuclear extracts or cytosol fractions (10 ␮g) from transfected tsa-201 cells prepared using nuclear extract kit (active

the positions of the mutations were: h323 on helix 5, s342
on strand 3, h449 on helix 11, and y473 on helix 12 [activation function (af)-2]. transient expression experiments
were performed using tsa201 cells, which are derivatives of
293 cells. to test the protein expression of the ppar mutants
in the nucleus, we performed western blotting using antippar␥ antibody. the protein expression level of each mutant
in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions of transfected cells was
confirmed except for h323a (fig. 1c). because the protein
expressions of h323a both in the nucleus and cytosol were
poor for unknown reasons, we used the h323y mutant in
subsequent studies. the transcriptional activities of these mutants were examined using a reporter gene, ppre-tk-luc, to
characterize the functional properties in the presence of various ligands (fig. 2a). first, all ppar␥ ligands significantly
increased luciferase activity in all constructs.  xxxd3303xxx  (10
␮mol) stimulated the wild-type ppar␥-mediated transcription by more than 35% that of the tzds, such as troglitazone
and pioglitazone. the activation induced by troglitazone was
significantly impaired in the h323y and s342a mutants and
that by pioglitazone was impaired in the h449a ppar␥ mutant. the effects of  xxxd3303xxx  were retained in all three of
these mutants. in the y473a mutant, tzd-induced activation
was further impaired, such that the activation by  xxxd3303xxx 
exceeded that of the tzds. rxr is the heterodimeric partner
of ppar␥. the 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx , which is an rxr ligand,
stimulated the wild-type and mutant ppar␥s, probably mediated by rxr. dose response studies were performed (fig. 2b).
the smaller dose (1 ␮m) of troglitazone, pioglitazone, or  xxxd3303xxx  slightly, but significantly, stimulated wild-type ppar␥mediated transcription. the effects at the higher dose (100 ␮m)
of troglitazone and pioglitazone were similar to those  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m,
respectively. remarkably,  xxxd3303xxx  at 100 ␮m instead decreased the transcriptional activity compared with the smaller
doses. in the h323y mutant, stimulation by troglitazone or pioglitazone at the lower doses was less than that in the wild-type
receptor, whereas stimulation by  xxxd3303xxx  at all doses was
comparable with the wild type. in the y473a mutant, the effects
were the smallest at all doses of troglitazone or pioglitazone, but
those of  xxxd3303xxx  were retained.
the effects of coexpression of coas (18), such as class i
( xxxg1511xxx / xxxg1511xxx ), class ii (pbp/trap 220), and class iii (pgc1)
were examined.  xxxg1511xxx  enhanced the wild-type ppar␥-mediated transcription by  xxxd3303xxx  and tzds (fig. 3a).  xxxg1511xxx 
also enhanced the y473a-mediated transcription by these ligands, which resulted in greater activity induced by  xxxd3303xxx 
than by tzd. similar results were obtained by the coexpression
of pbp (fig. 3b) or pgc1s (fig. 3c), both on the wild-type
ppar␥ and y473a. using the  xxxg1805xxx ␥-lbd fused to the dnabinding domain (dbd) of the gal4 yeast transcription factor,
gal4-ppar␥, and a gal4 reporter gene, uas-tk-luc, the effects
of coexpression of coas were also examined. fsrc1 ( xxxg1510xxx   xxxg2198xxx ),
 xxxg1511xxx  ( xxxg1511xxx ),  xxxg1512xxx  ( xxxg1512xxx ), and a histone acetyltransferase,
 xxxg1227xxx , proportionally enhanced the activities of gal4ppar␥wt and gal4-y473a induced, respectively, by  xxxd3303xxx  and tzds (fig. 4a). similarly, pbp enhanced the activities of

the interaction with rxr␣ was studied using a mammalian two-hybrid assay (fig. 5). ppar␥-rxr␣ binding was
retained among mutants. the interactions with cors, such as
smrt and ncor, were similarly examined. both ppar␥smrt and -ncor binding was relatively impaired in h449a
but was retained in s342a and y473a in the absence of ligand
(fig. 6a). to evaluate the effects of ligands on the ppar␥-cor
interaction, we constructed an mppar␥-lbd fused to the
transcriptional activation domain of vp16, vp16-ppar␥.
the interaction between gal4-cor and vp16-ppar␥wt was
disrupted by  xxxd3303xxx  and tzds but not 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx

mutant was mainly induced by  xxxd3303xxx . a higher dose of  xxxd3303xxx  (100 ␮m) did not increase the dissociation of cors, consistent with the results of the transcriptional activity (fig. 2b). the
interaction with coas was also examined. the interaction of the

fig. 7. interactions of coas with mutant ppars in mammalian two-hybrid
assays. the combination of chimeric proteins is shown at the top. vp16mppar␥ expression plasmids (50 ng) were cotransfected into tsa-201 cells
together with uas-tk-luc (100 ng) and 10 ng of gal4- xxxg1510xxx   xxxg2198xxx  in the absence or
presence of various ligands. results are the mean ⫾ sd from at least three
transfections performed in triplicate. *, p ⬍ 0.05 (vs. corresponding control:
no ligand).

interaction between ppar␦ and ncor is unaffected by coexpression of rxr␣ (60).
we created several amino acid substitutions based on the
study of superimposition of  xxxd3303xxx  bound to ppar␥ on the
cocrystal structure of rosiglitazone (9). h323, h449, and y473
were considered rosiglitazone-bound proteins, and s342 was
considered a  xxxd3303xxx -bound protein. unexpectedly, however,  xxxd3303xxx -induced activities were retained in h449a and
y473a as well as s342a; and tzd-induced activities were moderately impaired in h449a as well as s342a. h323a was an
inactive mutant but h323y retained some activities in which
tyrosine is used in the context of wild-type ppar␣. interestingly,
the y473a mutant was activated by  xxxd3303xxx  but not by
tzds. this specificity was partially explained by the relatively
potent dissociation of cors and recruitment of coas by  xxxd3303xxx  on this mutant.
the region of the lbd occupied by  xxxd3303xxx  might be comparable with that occupied by other partial agonists of ppar␥,
including gw0072 (61) and ntzdpa (62). using the mammalian two-hybrid assay, gw0072 dissociated ncor similarly to
rosiglitazone but only partially recruited  xxxg1510xxx  and cbp (61). in
contrast,  xxxd3303xxx  or irbesartan partially dissociated ncor
and minimally recruited transcriptional intermediary factor-2
(src-2) using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay
(63). using the mammalian two-hybrid assay in this study,
 xxxd3303xxx  dissociated ncor and smrt similarly to troglitazone but minimally recruited  xxxg1510xxx  from the wild-type
ppar␥. in addition,  xxxd3303xxx  dissociated cors and recruited  xxxg1510xxx  in the y473a mutant (figs. 6b and 7), indicating that the mutation emphasizes the effects of ligand binding on conformational changes of the receptor.

fig. 8. function of mutant ppar isoforms with respect to a ppre-regulated
reporter gene. a, the full-length mppar␥, -␣, and -␦ are illustrated. the
amino acids of mppar␣ and -␦ corresponding with h323 or y473 in the
context of mppar␥ were mutated as denoted by white dots. the central dbd
and the carboxyl-terminal lbd are shaded. b, the ppar expression plasmids
for the indicated mutants (10 ng) were transfected into tsa-201 cells
together with ppre-tk-luc (50 ng) in the absence or presence of various
ligands. results are the mean ⫾ sd from at least three transfections
performed in triplicate.

together these results clearly demonstrated that the
y473a mutant is selectively stimulated by  xxxd3303xxx  but not
tzds. y473a interacts with rxr and its association with
coas and dissociation from cors paralleled the activities of
 xxxd3303xxx  and tzds. the design of ppar agonists or antagonists is of major medical interest. one agonist for ppar␣
is the fibrate class of drugs that improve dyslipidemia. ppar␥
agonists, such as the glitazone class of drugs, are used to treat
diabetes. arbs, which are widely used for the treatment of
hypertension, also stimulate ppar␥ and may have different
effects. in conclusion, these ppar␥ mutants may be powerful
tools for screening and developing novel therapeutic agents
that retain metabolic efficacy of ppar␥ activation with fewer
adverse effects than tzds.
