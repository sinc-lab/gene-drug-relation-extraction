abstract genetic polymorphism is a diverence in dna
sequence among individuals, groups, or populations that
give rise to diverent forms. diverences in dna sequences
that occur naturally in a population. single nucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions of nucleotides and repetitive sequences (microsatellites) are all examples of
polymorphism. the position at which such a sequence
diverence is found is a polymorphic site. a single nucleotide substitution is called a single nucleotide polymorphism
(snp). snps can occur in coding parts of the gene. if they
result in genetic code change, amino-acid polymorphism
would occur. the heterodimeric ifn- receptor ( xxxg1142xxx )
complex was made up of two receptor subunits including
 xxxg1142xxx -1 and  xxxg1142xxx -2. there exist wve dbsnp alleles in
 xxxg1142xxx  exon region and six dbsnp alleles in  xxxg1143xxx .
some researchers had found that the greatest risk of the
development of systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) be
detected in the individuals who had the met14/val14 genotype or the combination of  xxxg1142xxx  met14/val14 genotype
and  xxxg1143xxx  gln64/gln64 genotype in japanese patients.
so we aimed to assess the association between two polymorphisms within the  xxxg1142xxx  gene (a88g and a839g) and

sle in chinese patients. this study included 154 patients
with sle and 159 unrelated healthy controls. we examined
the  xxxg1142xxx  genotype by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)-single-strand conformation
polymorphism method, rt-pcr-restriction fragment
length polymorphism method and dna sequencing. genotype frequencies between sle patients and controls were
compared and relationship between genotype frequencies
and clinical manifestations of sle were evaluated. we
found that  xxxg1143xxx  arg64/arg64 genotype decrease the
risk of sle (or = 2.326, 95% ci 1.181–4.581, fisher
p = 0.015), and the same as  xxxg1143xxx  arg64/arg64 genotype and  xxxg1142xxx  val14/val14 genotype combination
(or = 2.420, 95% ci 1.206–4.854, fisher p = 0.013). the
allelic frequency of val14/met14 is signiwcantly higher in
the patients with oral ulcer or thrombocytopenia when compared with patient without these clinical feature
(or = 4.630, 95% ci 1.370–15.640, fisher p = 0.021; or
or = 6.368, 95% ci 2.009–20.191, fisher p = 0.003). on
the contrary, the allelic frequency of val14/val14 is lower
in the patients with oral ulcer or thrombocytopenia than
those without these clinical feature (or = 0.216, 95% ci
0.064–0.730, fisher p = 0.021; or or = 0.157, 95% ci
0.050–0.498, fisher p = 0.003). and after data analysis, we
also wnd that the allelic frequency of gln64/gln64 is lower
in the patients with arthritis when compared with patient
without arthritis (or = 0.369, 95% ci 0.166–0.818, fisher
p = 0.017). we can conclude that the  xxxg1142xxx  polymorphisms (val14met and gln64arg) are protective in sle in
chinese patients. we describe a novel association between
val14/met14 carriage and patients with oral ulcer or thrombocytopenia.

introduction
many factors have been proposed in the pathogenesis of
systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), such as genetic factors, environmental factors, hormonal action, viruses and
dysregulation of cytokine production, the causes of this disease is not well understood. genetic factors seem to play a
signiwcant role in susceptibility to sle. single nucleotide
polymorphism (snp) was the most variation of human
genome. if located in the coding regions, these polymorphisms might lead to an amino acid substitution; if located
in the control regions, they might led to abnormality of
expression production. interferon- (ifn-) is a secretory
protein produced by activated t lymphocytes and natural
killer (nk) cells. it is an important th1 cytokine; it can
stimulate the transform of th0 into th1 cell. on binding to
a speciwc cell surface receptor complex interferon- receptor ( xxxg1142xxx ), ifn- induces antiviral activity, upregulation
of class ii major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecule expression, b cell maturation, and release of mediators
of inxammation.  xxxg1142xxx  encodes the ligand-binding chain
(alpha) of the heterodimeric  xxxg1142xxx  and maps to 6q23-q24.
 xxxg1143xxx  encodes the non-ligand-binding partner of the
heterodimeric receptor and maps to 21q22.11 [6]. their
encoded protein forms the  xxxg1142xxx  and is thought to interact
with stat1, gaf,  xxxg1219xxx , and/or jak2 in the interferon
gamma signal transduction pathway [3]. there exist wve
dbsnp alleles in  xxxg1142xxx  exon region and six dbsnp alleles in  xxxg1143xxx . some researchers had described the amino
acid polymorphism (val14met and gln64arg) within the
 xxxg1142xxx  and  xxxg1143xxx , and found that the greatest risk of
the development of sle be detected in the japanese individuals who had the met14/val14 genotype or the combination of  xxxg1142xxx  met14/val14 genotype and  xxxg1143xxx 
gln64/gln64 genotype [11]. in order to assess the association between polymorphisms within the  xxxg1142xxx  gene with
sle in chinese people, we examined the  xxxg1142xxx  genotype
of 154 sle patients and 159 healthy subjects by the reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)-singlestrand conformation polymorphism method (sscp), rtpcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp)
method and dna sequencing.

used as controls. the patients with sle involved in this
research project were under permission from the clinical
ethics committee of our institute.
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) isolation
a total of 10 ml of venous blood from sle patients and
control subjects were collected, anti-agglutinated with
edta, and diluted with an equal volume of cold hanks
solution. pbmc were obtained by  xxxd3253xxx  density gradient
centrifugation with lymphocyte separation medium
(tianjing tdb, china).
rna extraction
total rna was extracted from peripheral mononuclear
cells (2 £ 107 cells) of 154 sle patients and 160 unrelated
chinese individuals by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/
phenol extraction method (trizol, invetrogen, usa). rna
was quantiwed by absorbance at 260 nm and purity was
checked by 260/280 nm absorbance and the integrity was
detected by agarose–formaldehyde gel electrophoresis after
staining with ethidium bromide.
rt-pcr
one-tenth of the total rna preparation was used in wrststrand cdna synthesis (rna pcr kit, invetrogen product, usa). one-wfth of the cdna reaction mixture was
used as a template in pcr. pcr amplication was performed in a dna thermal cycler (pe2400, biolab, usa)
as follows: initial denaturation at 94°c for 5 min, 35
cycles of ampliwcation (94°c for 60 s, 60°c for 60 s) and

ice before being applied to a 10% polyacrylamide gel plate
(acrylamide:bis = 49:1, 0.8 mm £ 8.0 cm £ 9.0 cm). electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage 45 v for

products were also prepared for sscp analysis. the results
of rt-pcr-rflp accorded with those of rt-pcr-sscp
(p < 0.05).

two microliters of pcr products digested with 5 u of sac i
and fok i under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (new england biolab, inc., beverly, ma, usa)
were sized-separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the dna bands were visualized by the silver
staining method.
dna sequencing
dnas showing variation on electrophoresis were puriwed
and then sequenced. commercial sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination method was performed on an automated sequencer using xuorescein-labelled primer (abi
prism 377 dna sequencer).

the distribution and analysis of  xxxg1142xxx  and  xxxg1143xxx 
genotype
the distribution of  xxxg1142xxx  and  xxxg1143xxx  genotypes presented in table 1, and we calculated ors based on single
genotype and genotype combination in sle cases and
healthy controls in table 2. there was no signiwcant diverence in the  xxxg1142xxx  genotype frequencies of these two
groups except for  xxxg1143xxx  arg64/arg64 genotype.
because the frequencies of arg64/arg64 genotype in sle
patients were lower than those in healthy controls, so the
 xxxg1143xxx  arg64/arg64 genotype decreased the risk of sle
(or = 2.326, 95% ci 1.181–4.581, fisher p = 0.015). in
table 2, we also show ors based on genotype combination
in sle cases and healthy controls. the decreased risk of
the development of sle was detected in the individuals

statistical analysis
all images were visualized under uv illumination (gel
doc 2000 system, biolab, usa), data were analyzed by
quantity one 1d analysis software (gel doc 2000 system, biolab, usa). the allelic frequency distribution in
these polymorphisms in both groups were analyzed by the
chi-square test. when the assumption of the chi-square
test was violated, the fisher’s exact test was performed. a
p-value less than 0.05 were considered statistically signiwcant. odds ratio (or) were calculated from allelic frequencies with 95% conwdence interval (95% ci). the same tests
were adopted for the evaluation of subgroups of sle
patients with diverent clinical manifestations and autoantibodies.

the ampliwed products of  xxxg1142xxx  from rnas were
digested with endonuclease fok i and electrophoresed on
10% polyacrylamide gel. silver staining method shows
rflp. fok i digestion of the pcr amplicon produced 130
and 34 bp for the val14 allele, and an intact 164 bp product
for the met14 allele. we were not able to detect any homozygous for the met14 allele. the ampliwed products from
rnas of  xxxg1143xxx  were digested with endonuclease sac i
and electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gel. silver
staining method shows rflp. sac i digestion of the pcr
amplicon produced 170 and 19 bp for the arg64 allele, and

discussion
systemic lupus erythematosus is a non-organ-speciwc autoimmune disorder characterized by poly-clonal hyperactivity of b lymphocytes and production of pathogenic
autoantibodies. genetic factors seem to play a signiwcant
role in susceptibility to sle; it is also a polygene disease.
there have been a number of reports concerning the role of
allelism within the mhc for susceptibility to sle, e.g. the
c4a0 allele [1], the hsp 70-2 gene [8], and the  xxxg2296xxx 
gene [9]. in non-mhc genes, the  xxxd3135xxx  [14] and the
 xxxg385xxx  gene mutation [12] have been found to be

123

associated with a subset of sle. with respect to cytokine
genes, speciwc genotypes of both  xxxg1161xxx  and bcl-2 were associated with an increased risk of developing sle [5]. moreover, the greatest risk of development of sle was detected
in individuals who had speciwc genotype combination of
 xxxg1142xxx  and  xxxg1143xxx  [7]. the short allele of at-rich minisatellite in the 3⬘ xanking region of  xxxg1181xxx  gene was associated with sle [4].
the association of sle with autoimmune and inxammation suggests the importance of genes involved in the
cytokine network. in fact, the respective roles in the development and acceleration of sle of two diverent t helper
cell subsets, namely th1 and th2, have not yet been
clearly dewned. th1 cells, which produce il-2 and ifn-,
are responsible for cell-mediated immunity, while th2
cells, which produce il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-6, and il-10, mediate
humoral immune responses [2]. ifn- is a secretory protein produced by activated t lymphocytes and nk cells. it
is an important th1 cytokine. on binding to a speciwc cell
surface receptor complex consisting of  xxxg1142xxx  and
 xxxg1143xxx , ifn- induces antiviral activity, upregulation of
mhc ii molecule expression, b cell maturation, and
release of mediators of inxammation. ifn- is mainly
responsible for the th1 response, cell mediate immunity.
 xxxg1142xxx  dysfunction may decrease the transform of th0 to
th1 cell. some researches have shown that mice with a
disruption in the  xxxg1142xxx  show increased antigen-speciwc
il-4 and  xxxg1180xxx  production [13]. so speculate that the shift
to th2 as a result of the polymorphism may increase the
susceptibility to sle.
nakashima et al. [7] found genetic polymorphism of a88g
within  xxxg1142xxx  and a839g within  xxxg1143xxx . these polymorphism led to an amino acid substitution of methionine for

arch dermatol res (2007) 299:367–371

valine (val14met) within  xxxg1142xxx  and arginine for glutamine (gln64arg) within  xxxg1143xxx . they also studied the
association between the genotype and the genotype combination of these  xxxg1142xxx  polymorphisms with sle in japanese. their data show that there was association between
 xxxg1142xxx  met14/val14 genotype and sle. the risk of sle
also associated with the  xxxg1142xxx  met14/val14 genotype
was conwned to individuals whose  xxxg1143xxx  genotype was
gln64/gln64. until now, there is no data about the association between polymorphisms within the  xxxg1142xxx  with sle
in chinese, so we did the work two years ago. our data suggest that there was no signiwcant diverence in the  xxxg1142xxx 
genotype frequencies of these two groups (p > 0.05) except
for  xxxg1143xxx  arg64/arg64 genotype. because the frequencies of arg64/arg64 genotype in sle patients were lower
than those in healthy controls, so the  xxxg1143xxx  arg64/arg64
genotype decreased the risk of sle (p < 0.05). the
decreased risk of the development of sle was also detected
in the individuals who had the combination of  xxxg1143xxx 
arg64/arg64 genotype and  xxxg1142xxx  val14/val14 genotype (p < 0.05). in our study, there were signiwcant diverences in the val14/met14 genotype distribution between
patients with and without oral ulcer or thrombocytopenic
(p < 0.05). the allelic frequency of val14/met14 is signiwcant higher in the patients with oral ulcer or thrombocytopenia when compared with patient without these clinical
feature (fisher p = 0.021 or fisher p = 0.003), while the
allelic frequency of val14/val14 is lower in the patients
with oral ulcer or thrombocytopenia than those without
these clinical feature inversely (fisher p = 0.021 or fisher
p = 0.003). and after data analysis, we also wnd that the
allelic frequency of gln64/gln64 is lower in the patients
with arthritis when compared with patient without arthritis
(fisher p = 0.017). our results were quite diverent from
theirs, we think genotype distribution be diverent among
diverent races. for further identiwcation, we should amplify
our sample sizes, and use multifarious assay methods. we
consider that these polymorphisms do not play a direct role
in pathogenesis of sle, but are members of genetic factors,
which may induce the development of this disease by combination with other loci or other circumstances. in fact,
there was a normal individual carrying these polymorphisms. further accumulation of knowledge on genetic
polymorphisms concerning the cytokine network would
deepen our understanding of the genetic factors involved in
sle.
