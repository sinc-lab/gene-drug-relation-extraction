introduction

vasopressin, also known as the anti-diuretic hormone (adh) or
 xxxd3495xxx  (avp), is a cyclic nonapeptide hormone.
avp has anti-diuretic, hypertensive, and stress modulatory
effects, which are mediated by three different receptors, the v2,
v1a, and the v1b vasopressin receptors, respectively [1]. the
vasopressin receptors belong to the g protein-coupled receptor
(gpcr) superfamily. the oxytocin (ot) receptor is often grouped

with the vasopressin receptors, since these receptors and
their endogenous ligands share considerable sequence homology. there is also strong evidence of cross-talk between the
vasopressin and oxytocin receptors, as vasopressin can bind to
oxytocin receptors and vice versa [2,3].
the v2 receptors, which are predominantly localized in the
kidney, are important for the regulation of fluid homeostasis
(reviewed in refs. [1,4–6]). activation of the  xxxg231xxx  results
in increased expression of aquaporin-2 water channels in the

luminal membrane of the kidney, leading to increased water
reabsorption by the kidney, and thus resulting in concentration of urine. further, inactivating mutations in the v2
receptor in humans have been associated with nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by polyuria and
excessive thirst [4,6]. as such, agonists at the  xxxg231xxx  act as
anti-diuretics.
in addition to vasopressin itself, desmopressin, a nonselective v2 peptide agonist has been approved for the
treatment of polyuria. desmopressin (1-desamino-8- xxxd862xxx 
vasopressin, ddavp1, minirin1, octostim1) is a peptidic analog
of vasopressin used in the treatment of central diabetes
insipidus, a condition that results from the defective secretion
of vasopressin. in addition, desmopressin is also approved as a
treatment for other disorders characterized by excessive urine
production, such as nocturia and primary nocturnal enuresis.
however, desmopressin is not an ideal drug. while desmopressin is active when administered nasally or orally, its
bioavailability under these conditions is less than 2% in humans
[7]. furthermore, desmopressin is non-selective, with potent
agonist activity at both human v2 and v1b receptors [8]. the v1b
receptor mediates depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in
rodents [9]. in humans, an association between desmopressin
use and depression has not been studied, but evidence suggests
a role for desmopressin in anxiety-like behaviors. for instance,
depressed individuals that are treated with desmopressin show
enhanced cortisol and acth secretion compared to normal or
non-treated depressed individuals [10,11]. moreover, intravenous administration of desmopressin in normal individuals has
been shown to increase plasma cortisol secretion [12–14].
to date, only one non-peptide compound with selective v2
receptor agonist activity, opc-51803, has been identified [15–
18]. however, opc-51803 shows partial agonist activity in vitro
with only 9-fold selectivity for the human  xxxg231xxx  over the
human  xxxg229xxx . activation of the  xxxg229xxx  might lead
to increased blood pressure, adverse circulatory effects, and
possibly stress-related disorders [19]. thus, there is a need for
additional small molecule  xxxg231xxx  agonists that display an
improved safety profile and better pharmacokinetics. here we
report the discovery and biochemical characterization of three
small molecule chemotypes with selective agonist activity at
the  xxxg231xxx .

tional cell-based assay that allows one to monitor receptordependent proliferative responses [23]. briefly, contact-inhibited cells are transiently transfected with the receptor target
and a marker gene and maintained in culture in the presence
or absence of ligand. cells expressing the receptor overcome
contact inhibition and proliferate in the presence of agonist
ligand specific for the target receptor; the extent of proliferation is dependent on the concentration of agonist, and can be
quantified using the marker gene. when no receptor is
transfected, no agonist response is observed, indicating that
all assayed response is from exogenously expressed receptors.
the r-sat1 technology has been validated for a number of
receptors including gpcrs [20], receptor tyrosine kinases [24],
cytokine receptors [25], and nuclear receptors [26,27].
to elaborate, nih/3t3 cells grown in 840 cm2 roller bottles
(corning incorporated life sciences, lowell, ma) or 632 cm2
cell factory flasks (nalge nunc international, rochester, ny) to
70% confluency were co-transfected with dna encoding bgalactosidase or green fluorescent protein, the individual
human receptors as described in the text, and ‘‘helper’’ dnas
encoding accessory proteins such as chimeric g-proteins
[23,28]. transfection was performed using polyfect (qiagen,
valencia, ca) as per manufacturer’s instructions. transfected
cells were frozen at 80 8c in dmem containing 10% calf serum
and 10%  xxxd1896xxx , and subsequently transferred to
135 8c for long-term storage. on day of the assay, cells were
thawed and added in dmem containing 30% ultraculture
(lonza, basel, switzerland) and 0.4% calf serum (hyclone,
logan, ut) directly to ligands at varying concentrations on 96well tissue culture plates. each concentration of a dose–
response curve was tested in triplicate. after 5 days in a
humidified chamber at 37 8c, 5% ambient co2, medium was
removed from plates and b-galactosidase activity was measured and analysed as previously described using the bgalactosidase substrate o-nitrophenyl-d-galactopyranoside
onpg (sigma–aldrich, st. louis, mo) [25]. plates were read
using a microplate reader at 420 nm. data from r-sattm
assays were fit to the equation: r = a + b(x/(x + c)), where
a = minimum response, b = maximum response minus minimum response, c = ec50, r = response, and x = concentration
of ligand. curves were generated using the curve fitting
softwares excel fit and graphpad prism (san diego, ca).

development of proliferation assays for vasopressin
and oxytocin receptors
using the functional mammalian cell-proliferation assay, rsat1, pharmacologically predictive assays were developed
for the v2, v1a, v1b, and ot receptors [23]. as shown in table 1
and fig. 1a, the known peptide agonists, vasopressin,
desmopressin and oxytocin show expected responses at the
vasopressin and oxytocin receptors compared to published
functional and radioligand binding data [3,8]. the rank order of
potency of the peptides at the v2 and  xxxg230xxx  was
avp =  xxxd1847xxx  > ot, whereas at the  xxxg229xxx  the rank order

louis, mo) for 1 h. briefly, cells were incubated with
vasopressin or test compounds in dmem + 1% bsa + 0.5 mm
 xxxd2388xxx  for 30 min at 37 8c. for antagonist experiments, cells
were incubated with test compounds in dmem + 1%
bsa + 0.5 mm  xxxd2388xxx  for 15 min, followed by the addition of
3 nm vasopressin, and subsequent incubation for 15 min.
camp accumulation was determined using the camp enzyme
immuno assay (eia) biotrak system as described in manufacturer’s protocol (ge healthcare bio-sciences corporation,
piscataway, nj).

brattleboro rat assay for diabetes insipidus

male brattleboro rats (harlan, san diego, ca) were used as
subjects and housed two per cage in a room with a 12 h:12 h
light:dark cycle and temperature maintained at 22  2 8c. ac94544 (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, s.c.),  xxxd1847xxx  (3 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle
(10% tween-80 in 90% sterile water, ph 7.5) was administered
to brattleboro rats (n = 4/dose). for oral administration, ac94544 was dispensed by oral gavage in the same vehicle.
immediately after administration, rats were placed individually into a circular metabolic cage with a wire floor and a
funnel that led to separate collection of urine and feces. urine
was collected in a graduated tube and the amount of urine
present was measured every 15 min over a 2-h session. water

was avp > ot   xxxd1847xxx . as expected,  xxxd1847xxx  had no detectable activity at the  xxxg229xxx  at 15 mm. in addition, the
peptide antagonist (d(ch2)51, tyr(et)2, val4, arg8, des-glynh29)-vasopressin (manning compound) [30] was able to
inhibit the vasopressin response at the  xxxg231xxx  in rsat1 with a pki of 6.8, similar to its reported binding affinity
[3] (data not shown).

3.2.
identification of three small molecule agonists at the
vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
using the v2 r-sat1 assay, a high-throughput screen of an
internal compound library of 176,277 small molecules was
performed to identify compounds with agonist activity at the
human  xxxg231xxx . this compound library is heavily biased in
favor of compounds displaying drug likeness characteristics
[31,32], and has chemical properties which are in broad
agreement with those properties from the mdl drug data
report (mddr) and the comprehensive medicinal chemistry
(cmc) library. moreover, the library exhibits unique chemical
space properties.
the screening effort identified three non-peptidic entities
with v2 agonist activity: n,n-dibenzyl-phthalmic acid (ac94544), (3,4-dihydro-2h-quinolin-1-yl)-(2-methyl-2h- xxxd3045xxx -3yl)-methanone (ac-88324) and 3-[1-(2-ethyl-phenyl)-1h-tetrazol-5-yl]-4-trifluoromethyl-pyridine (ac-110484). ac-94544 had
potency of (pec50) 7.1 at the  xxxg231xxx , while ac-88324 and

ac-110484 were approximately 15-fold lower in potency (pec50,
5.9, 5.7, respectively). ac-94544 lacked any detectable activity at
up to 15 mm at the related v1a, v1b, and ot receptors and showed
toxic effects at 50 mm (fig. 1b and table 2). ac-88324 and ac110484 lacked any detectable activity up to 50 mm at v1a, v1b, and
ot receptors. also, ac-94544 and ac-110484 did not show
antagonist activity up to 10 mm at the  xxxg1642xxx . thus, ac94544 was extremely selective, showing over 180-fold selectivity
for v2 over related vasopressin receptors. ac-88324 and ac110484 displayed moderate selectivity of at least 20-fold.
of the three classes of non-peptide agonists found, the
tetrahydroquinoline class (ac-88234) was structurally similar
to the benzoazepine class (opc-51803) previously reported
and therefore not pursued further. however, the two
remaining classes had novel characteristics compared with
known vasopressin compounds. unlike vasopressin and
desmopressin which both incorporate a basic motif (arginine), the ac-94544 class incorporates an acidic functionality,
a carboxylic acid pharmacophore. although speculative at
this point, this could be the major contribution to the high
selectivity seen with ac-94544; in support of this idea, a
modeling study indicates that the arginine in vasopressin
binds to negatively charged amino acids in the v1 receptors
[33]. the third class, ac-110484, has a rigid pyridine structure
which may be useful for determining the spatial arrangement
for the pharmacophores for selective v2 agonist activity. both
ac-94544 and ac-110484 have drug-like chemical character-

than 500 g/mol (ac-94544, mw = 345; ac-110484, mw = 319)
and c log p values below 5 (ac-94544, 3.1; ac-110484, 4.5) [31].
in addition, both ac-94544 and ac-110484 classes are
amenable to further optimization by high-throughput medicinal chemistry.

3.3.

broad profiling of compounds

ac-94544, ac-110484, and ac-88324 did not show activity when
tested at other gpcrs. no r-sat1 agonist activity  xxxd1891xxx  mm was
observed at the adrenergic a2a, a1d, muscarinic m5, serotonergic
5-ht1a, 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx , 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b, 5-ht2c, histamine h1,
h2, dopamine d2, corticotropin releasing factor crf1, crf2b,
and calcium-sensing  xxxg343xxx  receptors for all three compounds.
no agonist activity  xxxd1891xxx  mm was observed at the prostanoid
tp, formyl peptide receptor (fpr), formyl peptide receptor like-1
(fprl-1), histamine h3, dopamine d1, d3, cholecystokinin
ccka, cckb, or  xxxg1618xxx   xxxg1618xxx , nts2 receptors for ac94544 or ac-110484. no  xxxd1422xxx  activity was observed
for ac-94544 or ac-110484 at the chemokine  xxxg370xxx  or  xxxg370xxx 
receptors. no competitive antagonist activity was observed for
ac-94544 or ac-110484 at the adrenergic a1b, a2a, or histamine
h1/h3 receptors. finally, no binding affinity was observed for

to further characterize these compounds, we evaluated their
ability to modulate second messenger release, a classical
function of gpcrs. in hek-293 cells transiently transfected
with the  xxxg231xxx , vasopressin stimulated significant camp
accumulation through coupling to gs protein (pec50, 9.4  0.5,
n = 3) (fig. 2a). similar to the r-sat1 assay, ac-94544 (pec50,
5.9  0.3, n = 3) was more potent in the camp assay compared to
ac-110484 (pec50, 5.1  0.5, n = 2). however, unlike the full
response observed in r-sat1, ac-94544 and ac-110484 showed
partial agonism compared to vasopressin with 27  4% and
68  7% efficacy in stimulating camp production, respectively.
ac-88324 was tested at a single 10 mm dose, and showed 21  9%
efficacy (n = 2). by contrast, oxytocin showed 182  69% efficacy
(n = 3) in stimulating camp production at the  xxxg231xxx , as
expected [34]. when tested as an antagonist, ac-94544 showed
extremely weak activity (pki < 5) in the ability to inhibit
vasopressin response, while the manning compound showed
weak sub-micromolar potency as expected [3] (fig. 2b). thus, all
three compounds were revealed to be partial agonists at the v2
receptor in the camp assay, compared to the full agonists
vasopressin and oxytocin.

3.5.

effect of ac-94544 in rat model for diabetes insipidus

v2 agonists are known to display anti-diuretic effects in vivo.
the brattleboro rats harbor an autosomal recessive trait that
results in their inability to synthesize detectable amounts of
vasopressin. these rats are thus commonly used as a model to
assess anti-diuretic properties of test compounds. ac-94544
and  xxxd1847xxx  were administered to vasopressin-deficient brattleboro rats (n = 4) and effects on urine output were recorded
over a 2-h session. as expected,  xxxd1847xxx  (3 mg/kg, s.c.) decreased
urine output significantly, from 10.8  2.3 ml (vehicle) to
1.68  0.95 ml (fig. 3a) ( p < 0.01). ac-94544 was evaluated at
3, 10 and 30 mg/kg (s.c.). ac-94544 significantly reduced urine
output in a dose-dependent fashion  xxxd1891xxx  and 30 mg/kg over the
2-h session.  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg, ac-94544 decreased urine output to
3.9  1.5 ml ( p < 0.05), and at 30 mg/kg ac-94544 decreased
urine output to 3.9  2.0 ml ( p = 0.06) comparable in magnitude
to the effect seen with  xxxd1847xxx . in a different experiment, the
decrease in urine output compared to vehicle was steady
throughout the 2 h following ac-94544 administration (10 mg/
kg, s.c., p < 0.001) (fig. 3b). finally, when administered orally,
ac-94544 decreased urinary output compared to vehicle at 2 h
following administration (fig. 3c). however, the effect did not
reach statistical significance, possibly due to the use of a vehicle
which did not exhibit consistent absorption (fig. 3c). these data
demonstrate that ac-94544 can act as a v2 agonist in vivo.

agonism at the  xxxg231xxx  were identified. two compounds,
ac-94544 and ac-110484, showed partial agonist activity in a
camp accumulation assay. ac-94544 was also able to decrease
urine output in a rat model of central diabetes insipidus.
ac-94544, ac-110484, and ac-88324 appear more selective
than previously described v2 agonists. ac-94544 displayed
over 180-fold selectivity at the  xxxg231xxx  compared to the v1a,

v1b, and ot receptors, while ac-88324 and ac-110484 showed
moderate >20-fold selectivities. in contrast, the vasopressin
analog,  xxxd1847xxx , displays nanomolar potency at both v2 and v1b
receptors [8]. moreover, opc-51803, the first reported small
molecule agonist at the  xxxg231xxx , exhibits less than 10-fold
selectivity at the  xxxg231xxx  compared to v1a based on binding
data, and a 50-fold selectivity at the  xxxg231xxx  based on
calcium signaling data [18]. notably, opc-51803 does not show
v1a-mediated blood pressure effects in vivo in rats and dogs,
but binding data indicate it is more  xxxg231xxx  selective (20fold and 40-fold, respectively) in these species compared to the
human [16,17].
the three identified compounds behaved as full agonists in
r-sat1 but displayed partial agonism in the camp accumulation assay. the camp accumulation assay, like most second
messenger assays, measures the amount of camp amassed
after a short 2 h incubation of ligand on cells expressing the v2
receptor. in contrast, the r-sat1 assay measures cellular
transformation observed occurring over a 5- xxxd1861xxx  course,
integrating multiple signaling events such as camp accumulation. this results in a highly amplified, highly coupled
functional assay with a large receptor reserve [23]. thus it is
not surprising these compounds display much greater efficacy
in the r-sat1 assay compared to the camp assay.
in vivo, ac-94544 behaved as a full agonist in the
brattleboro rat model for diabetes insipidus. the full
agonism of ac-94544 in this rat model is not inconsistent
with the partial agonism observed in vitro in the camp assay.
the brattleboro rat strain is a vasopressin-deficient strain,
which has been shown to have a higher sensitivity to
agonists than normal rats, and has been used to detect weak
agonist activity of reported v2 antagonists. for instance, the
peptide antagonist, skf-101926, which has antagonist
properties in several animal species and models, acts as
an agonist in the brattleboro rat as well as in man [35]. it is
also notable that, like ac-94544, opc-51803 is also a partial
v2 agonist in vitro with full agonist activity in vivo in the
brattleboro rat model [17]. taken together, these results
indicate that there is likely to be substantial receptor reserve
for v2 receptors in vivo, and that partial agonists of the v2
receptor could be efficacious drugs.
the chemical class defined by ac-94544 shows promise as
therapeutic agents. in addition to selective v2 agonist activity
both in vitro and in vivo, ac-94544 did show oral activity,
although additional studies will be required to quantify oral
bioavailability. moreover, ac-94544 was found to be stable in
the presence of human liver microsomes (data not shown). in
addition, further chemical optimization of ac-94544 has
revealed structurally related compounds with selective agonist and competitive antagonist activities at the  xxxg231xxx 
(data not shown). ac-94544 and related compounds might
thus be used to modulate disorders of fluid homeostasis.
current  xxxg231xxx  agonists are anti-diuretics, and as such are
used to treat central diabetes insipidus, polyuria, nocturia and
primary nocturnal enuresis. however, administration of the
full v2 agonist desmopressin requires careful medical monitoring to avoid the risk of water intoxication when coadministered with other water-retaining drugs. compounds
with partial and selective agonism at the  xxxg231xxx  might
modulate vasopressin tone in a more subtle manner than a

potent full agonist or antagonist, and thus might be used to
treat fluid homeostasis disorders with less adverse effects.
