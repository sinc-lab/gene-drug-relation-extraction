wnk1 kinase polymorphism and blood pressure response
to a thiazide diuretic
stephen t. turner, gary l. schwartz, arlene b. chapman, eric boerwinkle
abstract—single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in genes encoding or influencing renal sodium transport systems were
investigated as potential predictors of blood pressure (bp) response to a thiazide diuretic. a sample of 585 adults with
essential hypertension (30 to 59.9 years of age; 50% blacks; 47% women) were treated with hydrochlorothiazide for 4
weeks (25 mg daily, orally) to determine office bp responses. ambulatory bp responses were measured in a subset of
228 subjects. after adjustment for ethnicity, sex, age, and waist-to-hip ratio, 3 snps in wnk1 (rs2107614, rs2277869,
and rs1159744), encoding a lysine-deficient protein kinase that regulates thiazide-sensitive sodium–potassium
cotransport, made statistically significant contributions to predicting ambulatory bp responses, accounting for 2% to 4%
of variation in systolic and diastolic responses (p⬍0.05). snps in the ␤2-adrenoceptor (rs2400707) and the epithelial
sodium channel ␥-subunit (rs5723 and rs5729) were associated with similar magnitude of variation in ambulatory
systolic bp response (p⫽0.028) or office diastolic bp response (p⬍0.05), respectively. however, snps evaluated in
the furosemide-sensitive sodium– xxxd2988xxx  cotransporter, potassium inwardly rectifying channel, chloride
channel, thiazide-sensitive  xxxd3213xxx  cotransporter, epithelial sodium channel ␤-subunit, and the  xxxg1602xxx  were not associated with significant variation in ambulatory or office bp responses. polymorphisms in
genes regulating renal sodium transport, in particular wnk1, predict interindividual differences in antihypertensive
responses to hydrochlorothiazide. (hypertension. 2005;36:758-765.)

t

he objective of the present study was to assess whether
common variation in genes (polymorphisms) influencing
renal tubular sodium transport may predict interindividual
differences in blood pressure (bp) response to a thiazide
diuretic. among sodium transporters expressed in the thick
ascending limb of henle’s loop, we investigated polymorphisms in the furosemide-sensitive sodium– xxxd2988xxx  cotransporter  xxxg2078xxx , the potassium inwardly rectifying channel  xxxg1249xxx , and the chloride channel clcnkb.
among distal nephron systems, we investigated polymorphisms in the thiazide-sensitive  xxxd3213xxx  cotransporter  xxxg2080xxx ; the lysine-deficient protein kinases 1 and 4,
wnk1 and wnk4, that regulate thiazide-sensitive sodium
chloride cotransport; the ␤- and ␥-subunits of the epithelial
sodium channel,  xxxg2032xxx  and  xxxg2034xxx ; and the  xxxg1602xxx   xxxg1602xxx . rare variants in these genes
(mutations) cause monogenic forms of hypertension (or
hypotension) by increasing (or decreasing) renal tubular
sodium reabsorption, leading to volume expansion (or contraction) and secondary suppression (or stimulation) of
plasma renin activity.1 a secondary objective was to assess
the effects of additional polymorphisms in ␣-adducin and
genes of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (raa) and adren-

ergic nervous systems that were implicated previously as
influencing renal sodium transport or bp response to
diuretics.2–5

methods
the sample consisted of 291 unrelated non-hispanic black adults
(150 women and 141 men) from atlanta, ga, and 294 unrelated
non-hispanic white adults (126 women and 168 men) from rochester, minn, 30 to 59.9 years of age, with previously diagnosed
essential hypertension uncomplicated by other illness. study candidates were identified in atlanta from lists of registered voters and
other clinic, hospital, and community-based sources, and in rochester, from a diagnostic index of residents of olmsted county.2,6 for
inclusion, subjects were required to have systolic and diastolic bp
⬍180 and 110 mm hg, respectively, and no contraindications to
stopping drugs that could influence bp level or other measurements.
postmenopausal women were allowed to continue hormone replacement therapy. participants signed a consent form, and human studies
review boards approved all study procedures, which were performed
in the general clinical research center (gcrc) of each institution
in accordance with institutional guidelines.

protocol
subjects had their medications withdrawn and were instructed by a
gcrc dietitian to ingest a sodium intake of 2 mmol per kg body
weight per day. at a minimum of 4 weeks after stopping previous

†pⱕ0.01; ‡pⱕ0.001; §pⱕ0.0001.

antihypertensive drugs, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was given
orally each day for 4 weeks. body weight, bp, 24-hour urine
excretion of potassium and aldosterone, and serum potassium concentration were measured after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. oral
potassium supplements (20 to 40 mmol/l per day) were prescribed
after 2 weeks if serum potassium was ⬍3.6 mmol/l⫺1. at the end of
the drug-free and treatment periods, subjects slept overnight in the
gcrc. at approximately 6 am the next morning, blood for measurement of plasma aldosterone concentration and renin activity was
drawn from subjects in the seated position after a 30-minute period
of ambulation.
at each study visit, bp was measured between 7 and 9 am in the
subject’s dominant arm with a random-zero sphygmomanometer
(hawksley and sons, ltd). an initial reading was obtained after 5
minutes of rest in the sitting position, followed by 2 additional
readings at 2-minute intervals, the average of which was used as the
office bp level. in a subset of 116 black subjects (57 women and 59
men) and 112 non-hispanic white subjects (26 women and 86 men)
who agreed also to undergo ambulatory bp monitoring, technically
satisfactory recordings were obtained at the end of the drug-free and
diuretic therapy periods. spacelabs monitoring equipment (model
90202) was applied and removed on consecutive mornings between
7 and 9 am just after the office bp readings. subjects were required
to go to bed  xxxd1891xxx  pm (in the gcrc) and arise at 6 am but otherwise
not to lie down or nap during the bp recording. in atlanta, the mean
(⫾sd) number of bp measurements recorded before and after
treatment was 63⫾4 (range 44 to 70) and 62⫾5 (range 39 to 68),
respectively, and in rochester, 124⫾13 (range 75 to 139) and
123⫾10 (range 92 to 140), respectively. for each recording, the
mean of all readings was used as the ambulatory bp level. responses
to hydrochlorothiazide were calculated as differences between posttreatment and pretreatment bp levels.

laboratory procedures
we selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) for genotyping
from the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi)
database of snps (dbsnp) and the celera discovery system
database (see table 2). to characterize as much variation within
each candidate gene as possible, we sought (in descending order of
preference) snps causing nonsynonymous or synonymous changes
in exons, snps in potential regulatory regions, and snps in introns.
celera identifiers, beginning with the letters “cv,” are given only for
those snps not found in the ncbi database. otherwise, only the
dbsnp reference identifier, beginning with the letters “rs,” is used.
for wnk1, which is located on chromosome 12p13.3 ⬇0.62 cm
from pter, the rs2286007 c3 t polymorphism is in exon 8 at
position 841 552, resulting in isoleucine instead of threonine at
amino acid 665, and can be found by a match to the sequence
tcagggatcctctgtcttca[c/t]agaatctcgagtgag-

cagcc, in which brackets surround the variable nucleotide. relationships between the other wnk1 snps, which are intronic, are
depicted in figure 1.
the selected snps were genotyped using the massarray
system, which employs polymerase chain reaction amplification,
followed by an allele-specific ligation reaction, matrix-assisted laser
desorption time of flight allele detection, and genotype calling with
proprietary software (sequenom). the sequences of all primers and
probes are available from the authors on request. aldosterone
concentration and renin activity were determined by radioimmunoassays as described previously.2

statistical methods
for quantitative traits, the 1-way anova was used to contrast
means (⫾sd) across groups, followed by scheffe’s multiple pairwise comparisons between groups. for categorical traits, ␹ 2 contingency tests were used to assess differences in relative frequencies
between groups. linear regression modeling was used to assess the
associations of bp responses with genotypes after adjustment for
covariates, including ethnicity, gender, age, waist-to-hip ratio, and
baseline bp. analyses were performed after pooling sexes and ethnic
groups when there was no evidence of interactions with genotype. to
explore possible epistatic effects of snps within genes, pairwise
linkage disequilibrium between snps in a gene were calculated
using the gold software package,7 and haplotypes were inferred
using the phase 2.0 software package.8 all statistical analyses were
performed using sas 8 (sas institute inc.). test statistics with p
values ⱕ0.05 were considered statistically significant.

results
the mean age of subjects varied from 47.7⫾5.7 (black
women) to 49.7⫾6.4 years (white women; table 1). of 35
sites assessed in 16 genes, 23 were polymorphic in both
ethnic groups (ie, relative frequency of less common allele
⬎1%), 1 was not polymorphic in blacks, 6 were not polymorphic in whites, and 5 were not polymorphic in either
ethnic group (table 2). for the 23 sites that were polymorphic
in both ethnic groups, genotype frequencies of 16 snps
differed significantly between ethnic groups.
in the 228 subjects who underwent ambulatory bp monitoring, the covariates, including ethnicity, sex, age, waist-tohip ratio, and baseline bp accounted for 23% and 20%,
respectively, of interindividual variation in ambulatory systolic and diastolic bp responses. in comparison, these covari-

ates accounted for 26% and 11%, respectively, of interindividual variation in office systolic and diastolic bp responses.9
three of the 4 snps in wnk1 were associated with
statistically significant differences in ambulatory bp responses after adjustment for the covariates (table 3; figure
2). the additional percentage of variation in bp responses
explained by each snp ranged between 2% and 4%. these
associations were directionally consistent not only across
systolic and diastolic bp responses (table 3) but also across
daytime and nighttime recording periods and across ethnic
groups (data not shown). for the rs1159744 g3 c polymorphism, the covariate-adjusted mean decline in ambulatory
systolic/diastolic bp was 7.2/3.6 mm hg greater in cc than
tt homozygotes (table 3). when all 3 snps were forced into
the same linear regression model, only the rs2277869 t3 c
polymorphism made an additional (ie, independent) contribution to the prediction of bp responses; consideration of
haplotypes constructed from the 3 linked snps (figure 1) did
not significantly improve the prediction of bp responses.
in separate models predicting baseline bp level, serum
concentrations of potassium and aldosterone, plasma renin
activity, and urinary excretion of potassium and aldosterone,

only the rs1159744 g3 c polymorphism was associated with
statistically significant differences in urinary potassium excretion at the end of diuretic therapy (figure 3; in blacks,
p⫽0.200; in non-hispanic whites, p⫽0.049). the fourth
wnk1 snp (rs2286007) was not significantly associated
with ambulatory bp responses in non-hispanic whites (analyses not shown), and this site was not polymorphic in blacks
(table 2). similarly, a snp in wnk4 (cv1588330) was not
significantly associated with ambulatory bp responses in
blacks (data not shown), and this site was not polymorphic in
whites (table 2). none of the wnk1 or wnk4 polymorphisms were significantly associated with office bp
responses to hydrochlorothiazide when analyzed 1 at a time
or as multilocus haplotypes.
of the snps in other genes, the ␤2-adrenoceptor ( xxxg92xxx )
rs2400707 g3 a polymorphism was significantly associated
with ambulatory systolic but not diastolic bp response (table 3)
or with office bp responses (data not shown). haplotypes
constructed from the  xxxg92xxx  rs2400707 and rs1042714 snps,
which were in linkage disequilibrium (p⬍0.0001), did not
improve prediction of ambulatory or office bp responses. the

discussion
thiazide diuretics are the preferred initial therapy for hypertension.10 the bp-lowering response initially depends on
reduction of intravascular fluid volume attributable to inhibition of renal tubular sodium reabsorption, which is subsequently opposed by counter-regulatory activities of the raa
system. plasma renin activity is the only laboratory measurement that has been consistently associated with bp response
to diuretic therapy.11 an inverse relationship of renin with bp
response to sodium and volume loss is one basis for the
greater antihypertensive effect of diuretic therapy in groups

waist-to-hip ratio, and baseline (pretreatment) bp level.

characterized by lower plasma renin activity, such as blacks
and the elderly.11
previously, we investigated whether polymorphisms in
genes of the raa system may predict bp response to a
thiazide diuretic. we found that polymorphisms in the genes
encoding  xxxg99xxx ,4  xxxg36xxx ,3
 xxxg99xxx  receptor type 1,4 endothelial no synthase,9 and
the ␤3-subunit of g-proteins2 were associated with interindividual differences in bp response to a standard antihypertensive dose of hydrochlorothiazide. nevertheless, most interindividual variation (⬎50%) remained unexplained after all
identified genetic and nongenetic predictors of response were
considered.6 in this study, we sought to evaluate more
comprehensively polymorphic variation in genes encoding
and regulating sodium transporters that may predict bp
response to hydrochlorothiazide.
of 30 snps in 16 genes evaluated, 3 of the 4 snps in
wnk1 provided evidence of a mechanistically plausible
relationship between genetic variation regulating renal tubular sodium reabsorption and bp response to hydrochlorothiazide. mutations in 2 members of the wnk family of
serine-threonine kinases, wnk1 and wnk4, cause familial
hyperkalemic hypertension, also known as gordon’s syn-

drome or pseudohypoaldosteronism type ii (phaii).12 this
low-renin, volume-expanded syndrome of hypertension is
chloride dependent, responsive to thiazide diuretic therapy
and phenotypically the mirror image of the sodium-wasting
hypotensive syndrome of gitelman, which results from lossof-function mutation of the thiazide-sensitive  xxxd3213xxx  cotransporter. in phaii,  xxxd3213xxx  cotransporter
gain of function results from mutations in the regulatory
wnk kinase pathway.12 in some families, missense mutations in highly conserved regions of exons 7 and 17 of wnk4
abrogate negative regulation of surface expression of cotransporters, whereas in other families, large deletions in the first
intron of wnk1 increase its expression, which prevents
wnk4 kinase inhibition of the cotransporter.13 of the 3
wnk1 snps that we found to be predictive of ambulatory bp
responses to hydrochlorothiazide, only one (rs2107614) is
located in intron 1. however, it was also in linkage disequilibrium with the other wnk1 snps measured across the gene
(figure 1), 2 of which showed similar evidence of association
with ambulatory bp responses. results of the multivariable
regression analyses that considered multiple snps either
additively or as haplotypes did not improve prediction of
responses. consequently, we cannot precisely locate the
dna variation within wnk1 responsible for the observed
effects on ambulatory bp responses.
the wnk1 snp that most consistently accounted for the
largest percentage of variation in ambulatory systolic and
diastolic bp responses (rs1159744) was also associated with
differences in urinary potassium excretion at the end of
diuretic therapy (table 3; figure 2). because wnk kinases
also regulate potassium ion secretion in the distal nephron,14
and a defect in secretion is seen in families with wnk1
mutations,12 this observed association may be biologically
plausible and consistent with the bp response associations.
however, some study subjects received oral potassium supplements, and no differences were observed among the wnk
genotypes in plasma concentrations or baseline urinary excretion of potassium before diuretic therapy. also, markers of
volume status such as plasma renin activity and aldosterone
did not differ among wnk genotypes. we suspect that this
paucity of other phenotypic differences associated with the
wnk1 snps reflects their overall subtle phenotypic impact,
unlike the distinct phaii phenotypes caused by rare wnk
mutations.
the snps in other genes we investigated showed less
compelling or no evidence of association with bp responses
to hydrochlorothiazide. in particular, a snp in  xxxg92xxx  was
significantly associated with ambulatory systolic but not
diastolic bp response or with office bp responses, and 2
snps in  xxxg2034xxx  were associated with office diastolic bp
response but not systolic bp or ambulatory bp responses.
office bp responses to hydrochlorothiazide are only moderately correlated when measured in the same subjects on 2
different occasions (systolic response r⫽0.61; diastolic response r⫽0.64)15 or when correlated with ambulatory bp
responses measured at the same time (systolic response
r⫽0.51; diastolic response r⫽0.46).16 hence, the observed
 xxxg2034xxx  snp associations with office but not ambulatory bp
responses may be less reliable. we also question the validity

of the observed association of a single snp in  xxxg92xxx  (of 4
measured in this and a previous study9) with ambulatory
systolic but not diastolic bp response. we found no predictive effects of the additional raa system and ␣-adducin
polymorphisms measured in this study. however, our snp
measurements represent only a small proportion of total
variation in the genes, and the snps we measured may not be
functional or in linkage disequilibrium with functional variation. for these reasons, negative results in the present study
cannot exclude the possibility that variation in the genes may
influence bp responses to hydrochlorothiazide.

perspectives
antihypertensive drug selection remains largely a trial and
error process17,18 that often fails to achieve adequate bp
control.19 for a given antihypertensive drug, bp responses are
distributed normally: the sd of responses is similar in
magnitude to the mean response (⬇5 to 10 mm hg), and the
range of responses is ⬎4⫻ the mean response.20 most of the
variation in response is attributable to pharmacodynamic
differences that reflect the heterogeneity of pathophysiologic
mechanisms contributing to elevation of bp.21 mapping and
sequencing of the human genome, along with increasingly
detailed characterization of snps genomewide, offer the
promise that pharmacogenetic approaches may allow greater
individualization and efficacy of antihypertensive therapy.
results from this study suggest that common variation in
wnk1, encoding a lysine deficient protein kinase that regulates thiazide-sensitive sodium–potassium cotransport, predicts differences in bp to hydrochlorothiazide.
