● purpose: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  xxxd201xxx  0.5% in the diagnosis of horner syndrome in
pediatric patients.
● design: prospective, interventional case series.
● methods: ten pediatric patients with a diagnosis of
horner syndrome and 10 age-matched controls with
physiologic anisocoria underwent pharmacological testing with  xxxd201xxx . the difference between the pupil
diameters of both eyes under low (room light off) and
high (room light on) ambient illumination before and one
hour after  xxxd201xxx  was instilled was recorded. any
adverse effects during the examination or reported by the
patient’s parents were recorded.
● results: the mean differences in pupil diameters
before and after  xxxd201xxx  testing in the horner
syndrome group were ⴚ2.05 mm and 0.97 mm, respectively, under low illumination (p ⴝ .0049) and ⴚ1.48
mm and 1.1 mm, respectively, under high illumination
(p ⴝ .0051). three patients with horner syndrome
showed positive values (reversal of anisocoria) only
under high ambient illumination, but not under low
illumination. there was no statistical difference in the
mean differences in pupil diameter before and after
 xxxd201xxx  testing in the control group. conjunctival
hyperemia was noted in two patients with horner syndrome and in three patients in the control group. no
systemic adverse effects were noted during the examination or were reported by patients’ parents.
● conclusions: the application of  xxxd201xxx  in
pediatric patients is safe and effective in the diagnosis of
horner syndrome. the reversal of anisocoria was more

obvious under high (room light on) ambient illumination.

orner syndrome is caused by an interrup-

tion of the sympathetic innervation to the eye
and ocular adnexae, which may occur at any
point along the three-neuron pathway from the hypothalamus to the orbit.1 the clinical signs of horner syndrome
are pupillary miosis and blepharoptosis. heterochromia
iridis, enophthalmos, defective accommodation, and facial
anhidrosis may also be observed.2 in pediatric patients, the
pathologic processes responsible for this sympathetic denervation range from birth trauma to life-threatening
conditions such as neuroblastoma and brainstem vascular
malformation.3 timely diagnosis and appropriate evaluation are important for life-saving intervention.
 xxxd201xxx  hydrochloride is an ␣-adrenergic receptor agonist with strong ␣2 and weak ␣1 activity, which is
approved for the treatment of increased intraocular pressure after argon laser trabeculoplasty. it was demonstrated
in a previous study that the ␣1 activity of  xxxd201xxx 
facilitates the diagnosis of horner syndrome at concentrations of 1% and 0.5%.4 –7 in this study, we evaluated the
efficacy of  xxxd201xxx  0.5% under low (room light off)
and high (room light on) illumination and the safety of
 xxxd201xxx  in children.

complete workup, including a neurologic examination, urine
test, and imaging studies. ten age-matched patients with
normal neurologic examination results, no eyelid ptosis, and
a diagnosis of physiologic anisocoria were included as the
control group. the diagnosis in all patients of both groups was
confirmed by a cocaine 4% test.
the difference in the diameters of the two pupils of each
patient (anisocoria) was measured photographically under
low (room light off, 20 lux) and high (room light on, 225
lux) ambient illumination before pharmacological testing.
one drop of  xxxd201xxx  ( xxxd201xxx ; alcon, fort worth,
texas, usa) was instilled into each eye, and the patient’s
parents were instructed to apply pressure over the lacrimal
sacs for three minutes to reduce systemic absorption.
the difference in pupil diameter between the two eyes
one hour after the  xxxd201xxx  had been instilled was
calculated photographically. photographs of the pupils
were taken with a digital single lens reflex (slr) camera
(d2h, nikon photo products, tokyo, japan) and a 60-mm
microlens (nikon af 60 mm/f2.8 diopters) while patients
were asked to fix on a distant (6 m) target or were attracted
by a moving toy. all photographs were taken at the same
photographic distance (36 cm). with the aid of a highspeed synchronized flash, we fixed the lens aperture (f8)
and shutter speed (1/250 second) simultaneously. the
photographs were then transferred to a computer. we used
adobe photoshop cs (adobe systems inc, san jose,
california, usa) software to measure the pupil diameters.
the difference in the pupil diameters of the patient’s
two eyes was calculated. negative values indicated that the
pupil with horner syndrome was smaller than the normal
pupil. positive values indicated that the pupil with horner
syndrome was larger than the normal pupil (reversal of
anisocoria). for the control group, the difference in the
pupil diameters was calculated as a minus b before and
after the instillation of  xxxd201xxx , where a represents
the diameter of the smaller pupil and b the diameter of the
larger pupil before pharmacological testing. two investigators (c.-h.h. and w.-y.c.) were masked to and sepa470

rately evaluated the photographs to measure the pupil sizes
of both the control and horner syndrome groups. these
investigators were also masked to the corresponding results
during the analysis of data. in total, there were three
discrepancies between the two investigators. these three
images were evaluated independently by a third investigator (p.-l.c.).
any adverse effect related to the instillation of  xxxd201xxx  was recorded during examination. we informed
patient’s parents of the possible side effects (especially
serious side effects: somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, and
respiratory depression) regarding the use of topical  xxxd201xxx  and asked them to report to us if they noticed
any side effects during examination and at home. for the
statistical analysis, wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank
test was used. p ⬍ .05 was considered statistically
significant.

results
all children with horner syndrome included in

this study had unilateral relative miosis that was greater
in the dark than in the light (mean values, ⫺2.05 mm
and ⫺1.48 mm, respectively) and normal pupillary responses to direct light. upper eyelid ptosis of 1 to 2 mm
ipsilateral to the smaller pupil was also present in all
patients. iris heterochromia was noted in six patients
(60%) with horner syndrome (table 1).
the mean anisocoria values before and after the instillation of  xxxd201xxx  under high illumination were
⫺1.48 mm and 1.1 mm, respectively, in the horner syndrome group (p ⫽ .0051) and ⫺0.55 mm and ⫺0.56 mm,

thus decelerates ␣1-stimulated mydriasis.9,10 topical  xxxd201xxx  produces a mydriatic result in affected eyes
rather than in the unaffected eye, as is the case with
cocaine testing. therefore, when testing for horner syndrome with  xxxd201xxx , the reversal of anisocoria is
easily detected clinically with the naked eye, even when
the reversal is slight. previous studies have demonstrated
sensitivities of 1.00 and 0.88 with  xxxd201xxx  1% and
 xxxd201xxx  0.5%, respectively, when used in the diagnosis of horner syndrome,4,5 and 1.00 when  xxxd201xxx 
was used in the diagnosis of oculosympathetic paresis.7
however, a study with an age-matched control group,
involving a comparison of effects under low and high
illumination, has never been performed.
all patients with horner syndrome showed reversal of
anisocoria under high (room light on) ambient illumination after the instillation of  xxxd201xxx . in contrast, all
patients with physiologic anisocoria showed no reversal of
anisocoria. in a previous study, seven of eight patients with
horner syndrome showed a reversal of anisocoria under
both light and dark illumination one hour after the
instillation of  xxxd201xxx .5 however, in our study, only
seven of 10 patients with horner syndrome showed a
reversal of anisocoria under low (room light off) ambient
illumination. the reason for these different outcomes is
unclear, but at least three factors may contribute to the
discrepancy.
first, and most important, there may be less supersensitivity or enough release of norepinephrine from remaining
fibers to lessen supersensitivity in these three patients.

showed positive values (reversal of anisocoria) after the
instillation of  xxxd201xxx  under high ambient illumination (figure 1, left), whereas only seven patients showed
a reversal of anisocoria under low illumination (figure 1,
right, and figure 2). conversely, all patients with physiologic anisocoria showed negative values irrespective of
the light conditions, and the differences in pupil diameters
were almost the same before and after pharmacological
testing (table 2). conjunctival hyperemia was noted in
two patients in the horner syndrome group and three
patients in the control group. no adverse systemic effects
were noted during the tests or were reported by parents.

discussion
the pharmacological diagnosis of horner syn-

drome with topical 5% or 10% cocaine has been the gold
standard test for years.8 because cocaine is a controlled
substance, it is difficult to obtain, and because of its short
shelf life, a fresh solution must be prepared for each
individual patient. we found that parents were often
hesitant to allow the use of cocaine as a diagnostic tool
when it was suggested during this study. the effect of
 xxxd201xxx  in the diagnosis of horner syndrome is due
to the denervation hypersensitivity of the postsynaptic ␣1
receptor in the pupil dilator muscle. this effect may be
indirectly amplified by the absence of presynaptic ␣2
receptor activity, which normally down-regulates the release of norepinephrine into the synaptic junction and

room light off (bottom right).

these three patients showed no dilation in the affected eye
after topical cocaine was installed; therefore, this could not
be the cause. the reversal of anisocoria was less prominent
in these three patients than in the other seven patients
both with room light on and off. as dr kardon commented on freedman and brown’s series,11 the major
concern relates to the use of  xxxd201xxx  in the diagnosis
of horner syndrome is whether all lesions will cause
supersensitivity. unlike cocaine,  xxxd201xxx  depends on
supersensitivity. if supersensitivity develops slowly or incompletely, then theoretically,  xxxd201xxx  may have a
negligible mydriatic effect. to prove the hypothesis, a
larger number of patients with horner syndrome caused by
different etiologies needs to tested.
second, the different light intensities may be the reason.
there is no mention of the light intensities used in some
previous studies.4 –7 in our study, the light intensity with
the room light on was 225 lux, which is almost the same as
that used in other studies.8,12 with the room light off and
only an overhead lamp on, the light intensity ranged from
5 lux to 40 lux (full power on). at light intensities below
15 lux, it is hard to focus on a target with a digital camera.
472

american journal

therefore, we chose to use a light intensity of 20 lux for
low ambient illumination. when two of the three patients
who showed no reversal of anisocoria were retested (the
parents of one patient refused because of a previous
conjunctival hyperemia reaction) at 30 and 40 lux, the
results were the same. it has been reported that after
instillation of the drug, the eye treated with  xxxd201xxx 
had a progressively larger mean pupil diameter than that of
the placebo-treated eye (p ⬍ .05 at one hour, p ⬍ .01 at
three and five hours, p ⬍ .005 at seven hours).13 therefore, we retested two of three patients who showed no
reversal of anisocoria after one hour, but even after
observation for 10 hours, the results were the same.
a third factor contributing to the different outcomes
may be the different methods used to measure pupil size.
infrared pupillography is considered the most accurate
technique for the measurement of the pupil diameter.14
however, it is expensive and requires cooperation from the
patient. in our study, many of the subjects were too young
to cooperate sufficiently to be treated with infrared pupillography. to achieve a more accurate result, we used a
digital slr camera equipped with a microlens to photoof

graph the pupil. because we had fixed the photographic
distance, we also controlled the image magnification rate.
the pupil size in the image was then measured with image
analysis software. we believe that measurements made
with digitized and computerized image processing could
maximally reduce the observational error.
it is logical that the reversal of anisocoria was more
obvious under high ambient illumination, because the
influence of the dilator muscle of the normal eye is avoided
under high illumination. as when pilocarpine 0.125% is
used in the diagnosis of adie pupil, the larger pupil
becomes smaller because the cholinergic supersensitivity of
the pupil sphincter becomes more obvious when observed
under dim lighting.15
pupil dilation of approximately 0.5 mm was observed in
the healthy eye after  xxxd201xxx  instillation in a small
proportion of subjects in some studies,16,17 whereas in other
studies,18,19 no marked dilation was observed in the
healthy eye. in the study by morales and associates,4 who
used  xxxd201xxx  1% for the diagnosis of horner syndrome, three patients showed 0.5- to 1-mm miosis under
low illumination and 0.5- to 2-mm miosis under high
illumination. in our study, the unaffected eye in two
patients in the horner syndrome group (patients 1 and 7)
and three patients (four eyes) in the control group showed
a mean mydriasis of 0.4 mm (range 0.2– 0.7 mm) after the
instillation of  xxxd201xxx . the discrepancies in these
vol. 142, no. 3

findings could be explained by the use of different concentrations of  xxxd201xxx .
the use of an ␣-adrenergic receptor agonist in the
treatment of glaucoma in children has been reported to
cause apnea, bradycardia, hypotension, somnolence, and
lethargy.20 enyedi and freedman21 reported that, of 30
children aged 2.4 to 16.8 years who had glaucoma and
received treatment with brimonidine, two experienced
somnolence and five had extreme fatigue. in an evaluation
of  xxxd201xxx  0.5% and 1% to control intraocular
pressure, the incidence of ocular events was higher in the
 xxxd201xxx  1% group than in the  xxxd201xxx  0.5%
group (40% vs 29.7%, respectively).22 the most frequent
ocular event related to therapy was conjunctival hyperemia, occurring in 21.5% of the  xxxd201xxx  0.5% group
and 21.9% of the  xxxd201xxx  1% group. dizziness was
noted in 3.1% of the  xxxd201xxx  0.5% group, and dry
mouth was noted in 3.1% of the  xxxd201xxx  1% group.20
in a previous report, “sleepier than usual” was reported by
the parents of one of six children administered  xxxd201xxx  1% to diagnose horner syndrome.6 in our study,
conjunctival hyperemia was noted in two patients in the
horner syndrome group and three patients in the control
group, but no adverse systemic effects were noted during
the examination or were reported by parents.
there are some limitations to our study. first, most of our
patients (eight patients) were identified from their records.

therefore, there may be some bias in the etiology of horner
syndrome in the experimental group. patients with a condition that was amenable to treatment or required emergency
surgery might not be truly represented in our sample. second,
we have not defined a cut-off point in light intensity at which
the reversal of anisocoria can no longer be observed, but have
compared the ease of observing anisocoria reversal with the
room light on and off. the relationship between light
intensity and the reversal of anisocoria should be addressed in
a future study. third, the number of patients in our study was
small. a large prospective study is required to establish the
safety of  xxxd201xxx  0.5% in the diagnosis of horner
syndrome in children.
in summary, our results show that testing for horner
syndrome with  xxxd201xxx  0.5% has excellent sensitivity and specificity in children, with no adverse systemic
effects. we suggest that the reversal of anisocoria is best
observed under high illumination.
