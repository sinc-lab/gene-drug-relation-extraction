abstract: myeloperoxidase (mpo) catalyzes the formation of potent oxidants that have been implicated
in the pathogenesis of various diseases including atherosclerosis, asthma, arthritis, and cancer. melatonin
plays an important part in the regulation of various body functions including circadian sleep rhythms,
blood pressure, oncogenesis, retinal function, seasonal reproduction, and immunity. here, we demonstrate
that melatonin serves as a potent inhibitor of mpo under physiological-like conditions. in the presence
of chloride (cl-), melatonin inactivated mpo at two points in the classic peroxidase cycle through binding
to mpo to form an inactive complex, melatonin-mpo-cl, and accelerating mpo compound ii formation,
an inactive form of mpo. inactivation of mpo was mirrored by the direct conversion of mpo-fe(iii)
to mpo compound ii without any sign of compound i accumulation. this behavior indicates that melatonin
binding modulates the formation of mpo intermediates and their decay rates. the cl- presence enhanced
the affinity of mpo toward melatonin, which switches the enzyme activity from peroxidation to catalaselike activity. in the absence of cl-, melatonin served as a 1e- substrate for mpo compound i, but at
higher concentration it limited the reaction by its dissociation from the corresponding complex. importantly,
melatonin-dependent inhibition of mpo occurred with a wide range of concentrations that span various
physiological and supplemental ranges. thus, the interplay between mpo and melatonin may have a
broader implication in the function of several biological systems. this dual regulation by melatonin is
unique and represents a new means through which melatonin can control mpo and its downstream
inflammatory pathways.

melatonin or  xxxd2559xxx  is a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland in the brain synthesized
from the amino acid tryptophan. it plays an important role
in the function of the neuroendocrine system and the
circadian rhythm (1-4). its synthesis and release are
stimulated by darkness and suppressed by light (5-7).
synthetic melatonin is available commercially, and its
supplements have been used in a variety of medical conditions such as jet lag, conditions resulting from shift work,
and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. melatonin has important antioxidant effects (8-10). it can inhibit h2o21-induced
lipid peroxidation and lipoprotein modification. however,
the possible in vivo reaction pathways for these properties
of melatonin have not been identified yet (11, 12).
mpo-mediated lipid peroxidation plays a crucial role in
the pathogenesis of many disorders including arthritis and
pulmonary and heart-related diseases (13-18). mpo is a
150-165 kda protein synthesized during myeloid differ†

entiation and constitutes the major component of neutrophil
azurophilic granules (19). mpo displays a unique ability to
catalyze h2o2-dependent peroxidation of halides and pseudohalides to produce antimicrobial agents, hypohalous acids,
through the formation of a ferryl pi cation radical (e-fe(iv)do•+pi) intermediate, compound i (20-24). hypohalous
acids are potent cytotoxic oxidants which directly oxidize
reactive groups, including sulfhydryls, iron-sulfur centers,
and hemes, or react with amines, forming chloramines (25,
26). mammalian peroxidases also oxidize multiple organic
and inorganic molecules by two successive sequential 1etransitions, generating oxidant and diffusible radical species
through the activated intermediates compound ii (e-fe(iv)do) and mpo-fe(iii), respectively (27-32). mpo
compound ii is a long-lasting intermediate whose decay to
the ground state (mpo-fe(iii)) is considered to be the ratelimiting step during steady-state catalysis (33, 34). a variety
of spectroscopic techniques, with a combination of structure
analysis and advanced computer modeling, have shown that
heme pockets of mammalian peroxidases are envisioned to
form the catalytic site where the stepwise reduction of h2o2
takes place (35-39). structural studies have demonstrated
that the heme of mpo lies at the base of a deep and narrow
cleft (35-37). therefore, blocking the entrance of the heme
pocket, ligand-binding to mpo heme iron, or perturbation
in the heme pocket geometry may promote the inhibition of
the enzyme (37-41).

melatonin and mammalian peroxidases

biochemistry, vol. 47, no. 8, 2008 2669

despite the potential significance of mpo to both human
health and disease, little is known about the factors that
down-regulate its activity and function. in the present study,
we utilized a combination of h2o2-selective electrode, optical
absorbance, and rapid kinetics measurements to assess the
effect of melatonin on the catalytic activity and function of
mpo.
materials and methods
material. the melatonin used was of the highest purity
grade obtained from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo).
enzyme purification. mpo was purified from detergent
extracts of human leukocytes as described (42-44). trace
levels of contaminating  xxxg720xxx  were then
removed by passage over a sulfopropyl sephadex column
(45). the purity of isolated mpo was established by
demonstrating a reinheitzal (rz) value of >0.85 (a430/a280);
sds-page analysis was achieved with coomassie blue
staining and in-gel tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase staining
to confirm the absence of observable contaminating  xxxg720xxx  activity (46). the enzyme concentration was
determined spectrophotometrically utilizing an extinction
coefficient of 89 000 (m-1 cm-1)/heme of mpo (46).
h2o2 selective electrode measurement. h2o2 measurements were carried out using a h2o2-selective electrode
(apollo 4000 free radical analyzer, world precision instruments, sarasota, fl). experiments were performed at 25 °c
by immersing the electrode in 3 ml of 0.2 m sodium
phosphate buffer, ph 7.0. a 20 µm concentration of h2o2
was added to a continuously stirred buffer solution containing
various levels of melatonin and/or cl- (100 mm) during
which the rise and fall of the h2o2 concentration was
continuously monitored. where indicated, 20 µl of mpo
(30 nm final) was added to the reaction mixture. to
determine the effect of melatonin on h2o2 consumption by
mpo, similar experiments were repeated by adding 20 µl
of the enzyme solution (300 nm final) to a continuously
stirred h2o2 solution in the absence and presence of various
melatonin concentrations.
absorbance measurements. spectra were recorded with a
cary 100 bio uv-vis spectrophotometer, at 25 °c, in
phosphate buffer, ph 7.0. experiments were performed with
a 1 ml cuvette containing mpo (0.7-1.0 µm) preincubated
with increasing concentrations of melatonin (6-200 µm),
in the absence and presence of 100 mm cl-. concentrated
volumes of h2o2 solution were added to the sample cuvette
(20 µm final), and absorbance changes were recorded from
300 to 700 nm.
rapid kinetic measurements. the kinetic measurements
of mpo compound i and/or compound ii formation and
decay in the absence and presence of different melatonin
and/or cl- concentrations were performed using a dualsyringe stopped-flow instrument obtained from hi-tech, ltd.
(model sf-61). experiments were initially performed under
conditions identical to those recently reported for mpo and
other related hemoproteins to facilitate comparison (47-49).
measurements were carried out under an aerobic atmosphere
 xxxd1891xxx  °c following rapid mixing of equal volumes of a h2o2containing buffer solution and a peroxidase solution that
contained 100 mm cl- and/or different melatonin concentrations. reactions were monitored at both 432 and 450 nm.

solution, final) of mpo solution to the h2o2/cl- stirred buffer
caused rapid mpo consumption (dotted line). addition of 20 µl
(30 nm final) of mpo solution to the h2o2/cl- solution supplemented with increasing melatonin concentrations, 5, 8, 10, 16, 21,
and 32 µm (solid lines from left to right, respectively), caused
slower h2o2 removal. (b) the same reactions were repeated by
adding 20 µl (300 nm final) of mpo to a buffer solution
supplemented with 100 mm cl- (dotted line) and increasing
concentrations of melatonin, 5, 10, 16, 21, and 50 µm (solid lines
from left to right, respectively). tracings shown are from a typical
experiment performed at least three times.

for all kinetic analyses were improved by averaging at least
six to eight individual traces. in some experiments, the
stopped-flow instrument was attached to a rapid-scanning
diode array device (hi-tech) designed to collect multiple
numbers of complete spectra (200-800 nm) at specific time
ranges. the detector was automatically calibrated relative
to a holmium oxide filter, as it has spectral peaks at 360.8,
418.5, 446.0, 453.4, 460.4, 536.4, and 637.5 nm, which were
used by the software to correctly align pixel positions with
wavelength. rapid-scanning experiments involve mixing
solutions of peroxidase (1-2 µm) preincubated with 200

ability of melatonin to inhibit mpo catalytic activity.
our initial experiments utilized a h2o2-selective electrode
to determine whether melatonin serves as a potent inhibitor
for mpo. reactions were performed under conditions where
mpo was present in catalytic amounts. the results are
illustrated in figures 1 and 2. as a control, we first examined
whether melatonin alone can consume h2o2. in the absence
of mpo, following addition of 20 µm h2o2 (final) to the

25 °c (dashed line). the dotted line represents a h2o2-selective
electrode trace after the addition of mpo (300 nm) to the h2o2

melatonin concentration is associated with a decreased rate of h2o2
consumption. tracings shown are from a typical experiment
performed at least three times.

continuously stirred reaction mixture, the h2o2 signal rose
rapidly, achieved a maximum after ∼30 s, and fell gradually
as h2o2 was depleted by autoreduction (figure 1a, dashed
line). addition of different melatonin levels (5, 8, 10, 16,
21, and 32 µm) and/or a plasma level of cl- (100 mm) to
a stirred h2o2 buffer solution had no or little effect on h2o2
autoreduction rates, indicating that melatonin alone did not
significantly consume h2o2 (data not shown). addition of
mpo (20 µl, 30 nm final) solution to a continuously stirred
h2o2 (20 µm) solution supplemented with 100 mm clcaused a rapid consumption of h2o2 (figure 1a, dotted line).
under these experimental conditions, mpo metabolized clthrough a 2e- oxidation pathway, generating hocl. the
rapid disappearance of h2o2 did not occur in the presence
of saturated amounts of melatonin (e.g., 32 µm). instead, a
much slower rate in h2o2 consumption (figure 1a) indicated
that melatonin inhibited the mpo catalytic activity. because
mpo is thought to utilize melatonin as a 1e- substrate, we
next examined whether oxidation of melatonin could restore
mpo catalytic activity. experiments were performed under
conditions where melatonin concentrations were lower than
the h2o2 concentrations used. the results are shown in
figure 1a. mpo catalyzed a slow reduction of h2o2, which
accelerated upon melatonin oxidation. the transformation
that is apparent from our kinetic analysis may represent a
switch in subcycles in which the first step in h2o2 consumption is limited by the rate of melatonin dissociation from
the cl-mpo-melatonin complex when the reaction is
initiated by adding an mpo solution to a melatonin/cl-/
h2o2 mixture. in this case, the second step of h2o2
consumption is the peroxidation reaction after the release of
melatonin from the melatonin-mpo-cl complex by either
oxidation or dissociation to generate inhibitor-free mpo.
under the latter circumstances, the enzyme generates hocl.
thus, the variation in the binding affinity of mpo-fe(iii)
toward melatonin and the release of melatonin from the
mpo-melatonin complex due to its oxidation accounts for
the inflection point in the h2o2 consumption rate. the ic50
value, the concentration of melatonin that inhibits h2o2
consumption by 50%, calculated from the initial rate of h2o2

galijasevic et al.
consumption, as a function of the melatonin concentration
was 3 µm. the maximum stoichiometry value obtained by
plotting the melatonin concentration used versus the h2o2
concentrations corresponding to the cross points of the
extrapolation of the limiting slopes of the two h2o2
consumption phases for the h2o2 traces shown in figure 1a
provided a maximum stoichiometry of 2.0 ( 0.3.
when the above experiments were repeated by adding 300
nm mpo, the h2o2 consumption rates were significantly
increased, the duration of the reactions decreased, and the
trend by which melatonin inhibits mpo stayed the same
(figure 1b). neither the maximum stoichiometry nor the ic50
values were affected by the mpo concentration. together,
these results show how different melatonin and mpo
concentrations can control h2o2 consumption rates in the
presence of cl-.
in the absence of cl-, addition of 20 µl of mpo (300
nm final) to a continuously stirred h2o2 (20 µm) solution
caused an immediate rapid decay in the level of free h2o2,
followed by a slower decay, indicating that h2o2 was
consumed as a substrate by mpo during catalysis (figure
2, dotted line). the first step occurred immediately after the
enzyme addition and was attributed to the formation of mpo
compound i. the second step was much slower and was
attributed to the reaction of mpo with h2o2 after the
conversion of mpo compound ii to mpo-fe(iii) (44). the
first phase was significantly attenuated when an mpo
solution was added to a stirred h2o2 solution supplemented
with 2 µm melatonin (figure 2, top solid line). this indicates
that melatonin may have served as a 1e- substrate for mpo
compound i and reduced the multiple cycles of h2o2
consumption that occur prior to the conversion of mpo
compound i to compound ii. increasing the melatonin
concentration increased the rate of h2o2 consumption,
indicating that melatonin serves as a 1e- substrate for mpo
compound ii (figure 2).
rapid kinetic measurements. under substrate-free conditions, mpo-fe(iii) displayed a soret absorbance peak
centered at 432 nm and visible peaks centered at 573, 630,
and 694 nm. upon addition of h2o2 to mpo-fe(iii),
compound ii accumulation was observed at 452 nm, and its
formation occurred through rapid initial formation of compound i. compound i was characterized by a significant
decrease in the extinction coefficient of the soret absorbance
peak at 432 nm, as previously reported (33). figure 3a shows
mpo compound i formation and its conversion to compound
ii when an mpo solution was rapidly mixed with the same
volume of a h2o2 solution  xxxd1891xxx  °c, using the stopped-flow
diode array spectrophotometer. similar results were obtained
when the mpo solution was preincubated with 100 µm
melatonin prior to initiation of the reaction, except that the
conversion rate constants of compound i to compound ii
were progressively accelerated (figure 3b). at higher
melatonin concentrations, the rate of the absorbance decrease
at 432 was essentially identical to the rate of absorbance
increase at 452 nm (data not shown), suggesting that mpo
binds to melatonin and its dissociation from the melatoninmpo complex is the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction.
to investigate the mechanism by which melatonin exerts
its effect, we utilized single-wavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy to examine the buildup, duration, and decay of mpo
compound ii during steady-state catalysis at five different

melatonin concentrations (0, 20, 65, 145, and 300 µm). the
reactions each received an equivalent amount of h2o2 (20
µm, final concentration). as shown in figure 4, we observed
a rapid buildup of mpo compound ii at all five melatonin
concentrations, followed by a steady state in which the
amount of complex remained relatively constant, and finally
a decay of the complex after mpo had reduced all of the
available h2o2. the rate of compound ii accumulation was
enhanced nearly 75-fold in the presence of melatonin and
increased in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner
(figure 5a). the presence of melatonin had a variable effect
on the steady-state concentration of compound ii that
develops following h2o2 addition (figure 5b). finally,
melatonin significantly accelerated the rate of mpo compound ii decay in a concentration-depended fashion (figure
5c). a plot of melatonin concentration versus rate of
compound ii decay demonstrated linear kinetics (figure 5c)
and yielded a second-order rate of 1.9 × 102 m-1 s-1. the
first-order rate constant derived from the y intercept was
similar to the one in the absence of melatonin. this behavior
may suggest that mpo compounds i and ii readily used
melatonin as a 1e- substrate and, at higher concentrations,
melatonin binds to mpo and limits the reaction by either its
dissociation from the melatonin-mpo complex or its
oxidation.
to examine how melatonin affects the formation of mpo
compound i, we studied h2o2 binding in the presence of

figure 4: mpo compound ii formation, duration, and decay during
mpo catalysis at five different melatonin concentrations. mpo
compound ii formation and decay were monitored at 452 nm and
10 °c. initial melatonin concentrations were 0, 20, 65, 145, and
300 µm. experiments were carried out by rapidly mixing an enzyme
solution (2.2 µm) preincubated with increasing concentrations of
melatonin against a buffer solution supplemented with 40 µm h2o2.

increasing melatonin concentration at 432 nm. in the absence
of melatonin, complex buildup was relatively fast and was
best described by a single-exponential equation with a
pseudo-first-order rate of 390 s-1. the mpo compound i
formation rate was decreased by approximately a factor of
0.5 at higher melatonin concentrations and matched the rate
of mpo compound ii formation observed at 452 nm (figure
5d). melatonin may decrease the rate of h2o2 binding by
constraining h2o2 within the distal pocket of mpo or
limiting the reaction by either the dissociation of melatonin
from the complex or melatonin oxidation. observing two
kinetically distinct heme irons at unsaturated melatonin
concentration suggests that at least two populations of mpo
exist in the samples: free and melatonin-bound enzyme.
we next utilized diode array spectrophotometry to examine
the effect of melatonin on the formation, duration, and decay
of mpo intermediates as they occur during steady-state
catalysis in the presence of plasma levels of cl- (100 mm).
investigations were carried out for three different conditions: in the presence of subsaturated and saturated levels
of melatonin as well as in the absence of melatonin. figure
6 shows the change in absorbance over time after addition
of h2o2 to a solution of mpo containing 100 mm cl- in
the absence and presence of melatonin. addition of h2o2 to
a solution of mpo in the presence of 100 mm cl- caused
small decreases in absorbance (figure 6a), indicating that
the decay of mpo compound i is faster than its formation.
therefore, compound i did not accumulate. when the same
reactions were repeated in the presence of saturated amounts

0.062, 0.106, 0.142, 0.202, 0.242, and 0.398 s after initiation

in a parallel series of experiments, single-wavelength
stopped-flow spectroscopy was also utilized to investigate
how melatonin interacts with mpo and switches the reaction
from a 2e- to a 1e- oxidation pathway during the metabolism
of cl-. reactions were again performed  xxxd1891xxx  °c, and the
absorbance change at 455 nm was monitored following rapid
mixing of enzyme incubated with various concentrations of
melatonin (5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 µm final) in the presence of
cl- (100 mm final) against a fixed amount of h2o2 (20 µm
final). in all cases, mpo compound ii formation occurred
without any indication of the buildup of compound i. figure

and decay of mpo compound ii collected at 452 nm in the
presence of increasing melatonin concentrations. analysis
of stopped-flow traces collected indicated the formation and
decay of mpo compound ii were both monophasic and
accurately fitted by a single-exponential function. figure 8

of a plasma level of cl-. the observed rates of mpo compound ii
formation (a), duration (b), and decay (c) (monitored at 452 nm)
observed in figure 7 were plotted as a function of the melatonin
concentration. data represent the mean of triplicate determinations

rate constant at higher melatonin concentrations indicates that
melatonin binds to mpo-fe(iii) in the presence of cl- and
limits the reaction by its dissociation from the corresponding
complex. the dissociation rate constant estimated from the
saturation levels of compound ii formation (15 s-1) was
∼15-fold slower than that observed in the absence of cl(225 s-1), while the first-order rate calculated from the
intercept was similar to that measured in the absence of
melatonin and cl-. the decrease of the mpo compound ii
decay rate constant at higher melatonin concentrations
confirms that melatonin binds to mpo and limits the mpo
catalytic activity by the rate of its dissociation for the
complex. the plot of the duration of mpo complex decay
as a function of the melatonin concentration was linear. when
the same reactions were monitored at 432 nm, the direction
of absorbance change reversed and the signal amplitudes
increased, but otherwise the reactions proceeded with identical kinetics (data not shown).
to assess the influence of h2o2 on the catalytic activity
of mpo, the rates of mpo-fe(iii) conversion to compound
ii were determined as a function of the h2o2 concentration.
investigations were carried out by mixing a buffer solution
sublimated with increasing h2o2 concentrations with a buffer
solution sublimated with fixed amounts of melatonin (200
µm), cl- (100 mm), and mpo (1.2 µm). again, the
observed rate constants measured at both 432 and 450 were
identical, and the plots of the apparent rate constants for h2o2
binding as a function of the h2o2 concentration were linear,
consistent with a simple one-step mechanism. the kon
calculated from the slope was 3.9 × 105 m-1 s-1 with an
intercept of 7 s-1 (figure 9).

a wealth of clinical and biochemical data support the
notion that exogenic hocl/ocl- and hypochlorite produced
by mpo catalysis are implicated in the initiation of lipid
peroxidation, which plays important roles in the pathogenesis
of atherosclerosis and other inflammatory processes (5052). however, no effective inhibitors have been identified
yet for the enzyme. melatonin displays the potential capacity
to resist oxidative processes both in vivo and in vitro and to
combat oxidative damage not only to lipids, but also to dna
(53-55). our current studies provide the first direct evidence
that melatonin can inhibit the catalytic activity of mpo by
multiple pathways. melatonin significantly inhibited h2o2
consumption in levels that span both (patho)physiological
and supplemental ranges (56, 57). preincubation of mpo
with a cl-/melatonin mixture generates a more complex
biological setting and suggests the possibility of the existence
of two separate binding sites on mpo. the present results
are the first to show a direct communication between the
two binding sites. indeed, cl- binding significantly enhances
mpo affinity toward melatonin. in the absence of cl-,
melatonin mainly serves as a 1e- substrate for mpo
compounds i and ii. thus, binding of mpo with its
cosubstrate, cl-, may cause conformational changes that
significantly enhance the affinity of the second binding site
toward melatonin, which in turn inhibits the catalytic activity
of mpo. there is already evidence to support the existence
of two halide-binding sites that have a distinct impact on
the heme iron microenvironment in mpo and regulate its
function (58). therefore, any structural changes in the mpo
heme environment that arise due to binding of the cosubstrate
to the active and inactive sites or to mpo heme iron are
envisioned to potentially affect the heme iron microenvironment, its substrate binding, its reduction potential, and
its catalytic activity. this may provide new insights into the
biological role of cl- in facilitating the cross-talk between
the two binding sites of mpo. collectively, understanding
the interplay between the two binding sites of mpo, in
addition to the ability of melatonin to switch peroxidation
catalytic activity to catalase-like activity, may help us further
understand the catalytic activity of the enzyme and advance
methods of inhibiting mpo and its downstream inflammatory
byproducts. this alone may be important in biologic settings

where mpo is expressed. this process subsequently may
lead to the development of biomarkers and therapeutic
interventions of various conditions such as atherosclerosis
and other diseases.
the mpo inhibition by melatonin is due to combination
effects, which include allosteric binding to the entrance of
the mpo heme pocket and accelerating the formation and
the decay of mpo compound ii, which switches the mpo
catalytic activity from peroxidation to catalase-like activity.
this allosteric binding to the mpo heme pocket entrance is
enhanced by cl- binding to the halide-binding site, where
hocl is generated, and prevents the access of h2o2 to the
catalytic site of the enzyme. thus, melatonin competes with
h2o2 and switches the reaction from free to melatonin-bound
enzyme (active to inactive form), and melatonin also
competes with the cosubstrate, cl-, and switches the reaction
from a 2e- oxidation to a 1e- oxidation pathway. rapid
mixing of mpo preincubated with melatonin and cl- against
the same volume of h2o2 solution caused immediate buildup
of a transient intermediate, compound ii, which then decays
to mpo-fe(iii) through oxidation of another melatonin
molecule, thereby closing the catalase-like cycle. the ability
of melatonin to compete with h2o2 and cl- on the active
sites of mpo-fe(iii) and mpo compound i, respectively,
is a key feature that drives the enzyme to alter its function
to catalase-like activity. our kinetic parameters have indicated that the decay of compound i occurs faster than its
formation and the decay of compound ii occurs slower than
its formation; thereby, as a replacement for compound i,
compound ii accumulated during steady-state catalysis. this
mechanism of competitive inhibition has been shown to occur
with tryptophan and several phenolic and aromatic amines.
a model that highlights melatonin interactions and inhibitions of mpo is illustrated in figure 10. previous rapid
kinetic measurements have demonstrated that the reaction
of mpo-fe(iii) with h2o2 to generate compound i is
relatively fast with a second-order rate constant of 1.07 ×
10-6 m-1 s-1  xxxd1891xxx  °c (39). chloride at a plasma concentration of 100 mm is the physiological substrate for mpo (45,
59). mpo compound i oxidizes halides in a single 2ereaction, leading to reduction of compound i to mpo-fe(iii). the high rate of cl- catalysis was associated with
undetectable compound i buildup and a minimal decrease
in the soret absorbance peak during the steady-state catalysis.
in the absence of cl- and during turnover, compound i is
converted to compound ii both spontaneously by 1e- leak
(from endogenous electron donors) and more rapidly in the
presence of melatonin, which serves as an exogenous 1ereductant (33, 60-62).

galijasevic et al.
in the absence of cl-, mpo consumes h2o2 by immediate
rapid decay in the level of free h2o2 followed by a slow
decay (44). the first step occurs immediately after mpo
addition and is attributed to multiple cycles of h2o2
consumption prior to the conversion of mpo compound i
to compound ii (44). our results showed that melatonin was
able to constrain this reaction by accelerating the conversion
of compound i to compound ii. formation of compound ii,
the inactive form of mpo, limits the h2o2 consumption rate
by the slow conversion rate of mpo compound ii to mpofe(iii) (44), which can be accelerated by melatonin. in the
presence of cl-, only the first phase is observed, indicating
that mpo catalyzes the formation of hocl. hocl is the
active component of bleach, which possesses potent bactericidal and viricidal activities (25, 26). the ability of
melatonin to influence compound i rates of formation
strongly supports the notion that melatonin competes with
h2o2 and binds tightly to mpo-fe(iii), forming a dead end
melatonin-mpo-cl complex. thus, cl- facilitates the
binding of melatonin to mpo.
the ability of melatonin to serve as an inhibitor for mpo
is illustrated by the dramatic slow dissociation rate of
melatonin from the melatonin-mpo-cl complex. as a
result, the ability of melatonin to compete with cl- and serve
as a 1e- substrate can lead to a lack of accumulation of
compound i and direct formation of compound ii. alternatively, the melatonin-mpo-cl complex may interact
directly with h2o2, leading to oxidation of melatonin (63)
and generation of mpo compound ii. under these circumstances the catalytic activity of mpo appears to be limited
by the slow conversion of mpo compound ii to mpo-fe(iii). whether the reaction of mpo occurs by the slow
dissociation of melatonin from cl-mpo-melatonin or
through the direct reaction of the complex with h2o2 to form
compound ii, which in turn is converted to mpo-fe(iii),
has not been established. the net results, however, are that
melatonin inhibits mpo catalytic activity.
taken together, our studies suggest a bidirectional relationship that links mpo and melatonin. this interplay
between mpo and melatonin may have a much broader
application in biological systems. evidence suggests that
mpo-mediated reactive oxidants can promote protein nitration, lipid peroxidation, amine chlorination, and thiol nitrosylation (13-18). these species can trigger various
inflammatory events that affect immune defenses, atherosclerosis, asthma, and arthritis (13-18). thus, inhibition of
mpo and its downstream inflammatory byproducts could
be attractive targets in the development of biomarkers and
therapeutic interventions of various conditions such as
atherosclerotic and cardiovascular diseases. melatonin may
have a beneficial role in modulating the pathogenesis of
several disorders by inhibiting mpo catalytic activity and
function. since melatonin is a major player in the sleepwake cycle, the interaction between melatonin and mpo may
prove to be an important mechanism in the regulation of
circadian rhythm and other sleep functions.
to date, the crystal structure of mpo with melatonin or
other related aromatic molecules remains unknown. recent
studies by hallingback et al. utilizing computational docking
have shown that melatonin could be docked to mpo-fe(iii), compound i, and compound ii forms (64). to achieve
stacking, they have shown that the indole ring is docked

melatonin and mammalian peroxidases
parallel to the heme plane and close enough to the d pyrrole
ring. the distance of the closest indole atom to the center of
the d ring is averaged between 3.3 and 3.5 å. comparison
among mpo-fe(iii), compound i, and compound ii modeling indicated that melatonin was pushed approximately 1 å
away from the ferryl oxygen in both compounds i and ii. in
all three cases, the side chain of the indole compound was
directed toward the outside of the distal cavity (64). thus,
the heme iron cannot be reduced by melatonin binding under
our experimental conditions. melatonin, like salicylhydroxamic acid and benzohydroxamic acid (40), is a bulky
aromatic molecule that may influence mpo steady-state
catalysis by binding to the entrance of the hydrophobic
pocket of the distal heme cavity and preventing the access
of h2o2 to the catalytic site of the enzyme. previous epr
and x-ray structure simulations have demonstrated that
aromatic molecules bind near the heme center of mpo (40).
the hydroxamic side chains of salicylhydroxamic acid and
benzohydroxamic acid seem to interact with the heme iron
(40). recent studies utilizing rapid kinetic measurements and
no binding to mpo-fe(iii) heme iron have also supported
the existence of two halide-binding sites that have a distinct
impact on the heme iron microenvironment in mpo (58).
our current results are consistent with two binding sites since
the inhibition of mpo requires the occupation of both mpo
binding sites, one site with chloride and the other site with
melatonin.
understanding the circumstances that lead to mpo inhibition can provide important information and a general
framework of understanding the role of mpo in certain
diseases. the heme moiety of mpo plays a critical role in
ligand binding and catalytic function of the enzyme (33, 65,
66). its primary function is to support electron transfer within
the catalytic domain of the enzyme during catalysis (33, 65,
66). our current findings provide further evidence for an
allosteric coupling among melatonin, the mpo entrance
binding (regulatory) site, and the catalytic center that induces
detectable inhibition of mpo. consequently, oxidation of
melatonin is required before it diffuses from the binding site
of the enzyme and restores the catalytic activity of mpo.
the finding that oxidation of melatonin can restore the
catalytic activity of mpo is very intriguing. because
melatonin oxidation is h2o2 dependent, we calculated the
ratio between melatonin consumed and h2o2 consumed and
found it requires approximately a 2:1 ratio for mpo
reactivation. this ratio is consistent with the fact that
melatonin switches the peroxidase function from peroxidation
to catalase-like activity (figure 10). more importantly,
oxidized melatonin had no biologically harmful sequela and
no effect on mpo activity. thus, inactivation of mpo and
its catalytic duration can be controlled effectively by melatonin supplementation. indeed, when the melatonin concentration is less than twice the h2o2 concentration, h2o2
consumption proceeds in a slower and linear manner and
mpo decays rapidly to mpo-fe(iii) after melatonin oxidation. this behavior clearly demonstrates that mpo is capable
of restoring its catalytic activity and rejoining the peroxidase
cycle after melatonin exhaustion. on the other hand, when
the melatonin concentration is greater than twice the h2o2
concentration, the initial slow phase of h2o2 consumption
remains at the same rate through the progression of the
reaction and ceases when h2o2 is completely consumed. the

biochemistry, vol. 47, no. 8, 2008 2675
oxidation of melatonin is supported by the control studies
that show no h2o2 consumption in the absence of mpo.
melatonin and peroxidase activities are apparently coupled
through complex and interdependent pathways. it appears
that the affinity of mpo for melatonin is very high under
physiological conditions. mpo may be acting as a chelator
for melatonin and limiting its bioavailability and function.
this may partly explain the harmful effects of sleep loss on
various body functions. in addition, melatonin may have an
important role in the inhibition of mpo activity in various
tissues during inflammation. hence, it is possible to speculate
that increased inflammation and decreased immunity associated with lack of sleep are the result of a lack of inhibitory
protective effects of melatonin on mpo during prolonged
waking hours and chronic sleep loss. on the other hand, the
pathogenesis of various disease processes can be very
complicated and involves multiple inflammatory mediators
and oxidizing agents. the biological consequences of melatonin-peroxidase interactions may have broad implications
in the regulation of sleep, inflammation, infectious, and
cardiovascular events in vivo.
