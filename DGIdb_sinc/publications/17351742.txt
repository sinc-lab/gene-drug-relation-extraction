to the editor
in their interesting paper, finn et al. [1] reported that
 xxxd1815xxx  selectively inhibits growth of basal-type/’’triplenegative’’ breast cancer cell lines growing in vitro. authors
discussed that this activity may be happened through the
inhibition of src and/or bcl kinase. interestingly, by using a
panel of 21 basal-like tumors, nielsen et al. [2] showed
that triple-negative breast cancer cell was typically
immunohistochemically negative for  xxxg730xxx  and
her2 but positive for basal cytokeratins,  xxxg682xxx , and/or
c-kit. in another study it was shown that  xxxd1815xxx  also
inhibits c-kit in addition to inhibition of src and bcl kinases
[3]. therefore, inhibitory activity of  xxxd1815xxx  on the
growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines may also
be attributed to inhibition of c-kit in these cell lines.

small molecule inhibitor of both the src and abl kinases,
selectively inhibits growth of basal-type/’’triple-negative’’ breast
cancer cell lines growing in vitro. breast cancer res treat
