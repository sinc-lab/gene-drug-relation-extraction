abstract
we present a mechanism for agonist-promoted ␣2a-adrenergic
receptor (␣2a-ar) activation based on structural, pharmacological, and theoretical evidence of the interactions between phenethylamine ligands and ␣2a-ar. in this study, we have: 1)
isolated enantiomerically pure phenethylamines that differ both
in their chirality about the ␤-carbon, and in the presence/absence of one or more hydroxyl groups: the ␤-oh and the
catecholic meta- and para-oh groups; 2) used [3h]uk-14,304
[5-bromo-n-(4,5-dihydro-1h-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine;
agonist] and [3h]rx821002 [2-(2-methoxy-1,4-benzodioxan-2yl)-2-imidazoline; antagonist] competition binding assays to determine binding affinities of these ligands to the high- and
low-affinity forms of ␣2a-ar; 3) tested the ability of the ligands
to promote receptor activation by measuring agonist-induced
stimulation of [35s]gtp␥s binding in isolated cell membranes;

␣2-adrenoceptors (␣2-ars) belong to the rhodopsin-like
class of g-protein coupled receptors (gpcrs), characterized
by seven transmembrane (tm) ␣-helices with an extracellular n-terminus and a cytoplasmic c-terminus (kobilka et al.,
1987; bikker et al., 1998). the tm helices in ␣2-ars form a
water-accessible binding site for ligands in a pocket or crevice
between the helices in the interior of the receptor. residues
within this cavity directly participate in ligand binding,
which stabilizes the conformation of the receptor. agonist
ligands, whose pharmacological activity is manifested as an
activation of downstream signaling, shift the equilibrium
between the inactive and active receptor conformations in
favor of the active form (gether and kobilka, 1998). through
their interactions with naturally occurring and synthetic ligands, ␣2-ars mediate a variety of physiological and pharthis work was supported by the academy of finland, the technology
development center of finland, juvantia pharma ltd., and the erna and
victor hasselblad foundation and by a computational grant from the center
for scientific computing (espoo, finland).

and 4) used automated docking methods and our ␣2a-ar
model to predict the binding modes of the ligands inside the
␣2a-ar binding site. the ligand molecules are sequentially
missing different functional groups, and we have correlated the
structural features of the ligands and ligand-receptor interactions with experimental ligand binding and receptor activation
data. based on the analysis, we show that structural rearrangements in transmembrane helix (tm) 5 could take place upon
binding and subsequent activation of ␣2a-ar by phenethylamine agonists. we suggest that the following residues are
important in phenethylamine interactions with ␣2a-ar: asp113
(d3.32), val114 (v3.33), and thr118 (t3.37) in  xxxg2318xxx ; ser200 (s5.42),
cys201 (c5.43), and ser204 (s5.46) in  xxxg2318xxx ; phe391 (f6.52) and
tyr394 (y6.55) in tm6; and phe411 (f7.38) and phe412 (f7.39) in
tm7.

macological effects, and are thus key targets for pharmaceutical development. ␣2-ars have therapeutic applications in a
variety of diseases, for example, in the treatment of hypertension, pain, and depression (ruffolo et al., 1993; macdonald et al., 1997).
for ␣2a-ars, as well as all other types of ␣- and ␤-adrenoceptors, a conserved aspartate in the third transmembrane
helix ( xxxg2318xxx ) has been established as a residue critical for
phenethylamine ligand binding. in the human ␣2a-ar, this
residue corresponds to asp113 [d3.32 according to the indexing system of ballesteros and weinstein (1995)]. the negatively charged aspartate in  xxxg2318xxx  provides an anchoring point
for ligands containing positively charged amine groups (ruffolo, 1991; kobilka, 1995). other residues suggested to be
involved in the binding of phenethylamine ligands in ␣2a-ar
include cys201 (c5.43) in  xxxg2318xxx  (marjamäki et al., 1999; marjamäki et al., 1998), ser200 (s5.42) and ser204 (s5.46) also in
 xxxg2318xxx  (marjamäki et al., 1998, 1999; rudling et al., 1999;
salminen et al., 1999), and aromatic residues in tm6 (ko-

nyrönen et al.

to play an essential role in catecholamine binding, is apparently less important in photoactivation of bovine rhodopsin.
in the current study, we use two sets of ligand binding
experiments, a functional receptor activation assay, and molecular modeling to predict the binding modes of 12 phenethylamine ligands, and present a model of how they could
promote the activation of ␣2a-ar. we present an atomic
resolution model for the binding mode of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and their close structural analogs based on the
results of these experiments, and provide a structural explanation for the binding affinity differences of the r- and senantiomers of these molecules. in the model, the most critical interactions for the binding of the agonists exist between
the ligands and residues in  xxxg2318xxx ,  xxxg2318xxx , tm6, and tm7 of
␣2a-ar, which is consistent with many earlier reports. the
structural basis for the roles of the charged amine group, the
n-methyl group of epinephrine, the ␤-oh group, the aromatic ring, and the catecholic para- and meta-hydroxyls for
ligand binding and receptor activation in ␣2a-ar are also
revealed by this study.

materials and methods
experimental materials. [3h]rx821002 [2-(2-methoxy-1,4-benzodioxan-2-yl)-2-imidazoline] was obtained from amersham (buckinghamshire, uk; specific activity 52 ci/mmol). [3h]uk-14,304
[5-bromo-n-(4,5-dihydro-1h-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine] (62.5
ci/mmol) and [35s]gtp␥s (1,225 ci/mmol) were obtained from nen
(boston, ma).  xxxd201xxx , dopamine, (r)-norepinephrine (bitartrate), and unlabeled uk-14,304 were supplied by rbi/sigma
(natick, ma). (r)-2-amino-1-phenyl-ethanol and (s)-norepinephrine
(hydrogen l-tartrate) were purchased from fluka sigma-aldrich
(buchs, switzerland). (r)-epinephrine was from sigma chemical
(st. louis, mo). (r,s)-norphenephrine and (r,s)-octopamine were
obtained from aldrich chemical (milwaukee, wi). the enantiomers
of norphenephrine and octopamine were prepared using pseudomonas cepacia lipase-catalyzed resolution of the racemates (fmoc-protected in the case of octopamine) through enantioselective acylation
in toluene/tetrahydrofurane (3:1). nh3 treatment provided the free
(r)- and (s)-norphenephrine counterparts (enantiomeric excess ⬎
98%). candida antarctica lipase b-catalyzed ethanolysis and treatment with piperidine (5% (v/v)) in tetrahydrofurane provided the free
(r)- and (s)-octopamine enantiomers (enantiomeric excess ⬎ 98%
and 91%, respectively). cell culture reagents were supplied by life
technologies (gaithersburg, md). other chemicals were of analytical or reagent grade, and were purchased from commercial suppliers.
transfection and cell culture. adherent chinese hamster
ovary cells (american type culture collection, manassas, va) were
cultured as reported previously (pohjanoksa et al., 1997). cells were
transfected with a pmamneo-based expression construct encoding
the human ␣2a-ar and standard methods (pohjanoksa et al., 1997).
neomycin ( xxxg418xxx ; sigma)-resistant (750 ␮g/ml) cell cultures were
examined for their ability to bind the ␣2a-ar antagonist
[3h]rx821002. the transfected clonal cell lines were cultured in
medium containing 250 ␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx . the cell clone chosen for the
experiments expressed ␣2a-ar at a density of 1.3 pmol/mg total
cellular protein as determined with saturation binding experiments
with [3h]rx821002 (pohjanoksa et al., 1997).
competition ligand binding assays. competition binding assays with [3h]rx821002 were performed as reported previously
(halme et al., 1995; marjamäki et al., 1999), using a radioligand
concentration close to its affinity constant (kd) for ␣2a-ar and 13 to
15 concentrations of the competitive ligands. the assay buffer was 50
mm k⫹-phosphate buffer supplemented with 10 mm mgcl2. for
agonist competition assays with [3h]uk-14,304 as radioligand, cell
membranes (about 10 ␮g protein/sample) and 0.6 nm [3h]uk-14,304

bilka, 1995). binding of the ␤-oh group of the phenethylamines to adrenergic receptors has been suggested to involve
a serine (s2.61) in tm2 (li et al., 1995; hieble et al., 1998), a
serine (s4.57) in tm4 (strader et al., 1989; trumpp-kallmeyer et al., 1992), a serine in tm7 (s7.46; hieble et al., 1998),
and an asparagine (n6.55) in tm6 of the ␤2-ar (wieland et
al., 1996). the latter hydrogen bonding interaction could also
be possible in ␣2a-ar, where residue 6.55 is a tyrosine. however, hieble and colleagues (1998) have shown that this
residue has no effect on the stereospecific binding of the
␤-oh in phenethylamines. none of these proposals is compatible with our docking results, and we will suggest an
alternative determinant for the stereospecific binding of
␤-oh-phenethylamines to ␣2a-ar.
the first successful structural explanation for phenethylamine agonist binding to adrenergic receptors was the threepoint attachment hypothesis outlined by easson and stedman in the 1930s (see ruffolo, 1991). the original hypothesis
was formulated without any empirical information on the
structure of the binding site. although no x-ray structure of
␣2a-ar has so far been reported, the functional, structural,
and experimental data that exist in the literature for multiple classes of gpcrs can be combined to make an atomic
resolution model of a particular member of the receptor family (bikker et al., 1998). receptor binding and activation
assays, combined with a three-dimensional model of the receptor, allow us to study the receptor in great detail, which
improves understanding of the conformational changes that
take place upon receptor activation. the common location of
the ligand binding site for many rhodopsin-like gpcrs between  xxxg2318xxx ,  xxxg2318xxx , and tm6, and the accumulated functional
and structural evidence suggest that the activation of gpcrs
is connected to the movement of these transmembrane helices with respect to each other (kobilka, 1995; beck-sickinger,
1996; gether et al., 1997; unger et al., 1997; gether and
kobilka, 1998). we have previously introduced cysteine substitutions along  xxxg2318xxx  and demonstrated that two alkylating
agents with different chemical structures, chloroethylclonidine and 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate, most
likely recognize two different conformations of the human
␣2a-ar (marjamäki et al., 1999). molecular modeling (salminen et al., 1999) of the different receptor variants with these
alkylating agents supported this assertion and suggested to
us that  xxxg2318xxx  might rotate when ␣2a-ar is activated.
we now have a structural model for ␣2a-ar (salminen et
al., 1999) whose functionality has been verified through experimental studies that include site-directed mutagenesis
and ligand binding assays (marjamäki et al., 1999; salminen
et al., 1999) and that offers a better structural explanation
for small molecule ligand binding in comparison to models
based on the bacteriorhodopsin x-ray structure (marjamäki
et al., 1999; salminen et al., 1999). the model is based on an
␣-carbon template for the backbone of the receptor, and derives from the low-resolution electron microscopy structure of
frog rhodopsin and sequence alignments of hundreds of
gpcrs (baldwin et al., 1997). we also have a new model
based on the x-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin (palczewski
et al., 2000). the model based on this new structure positions
most of the same residues within the binding cavity as seen
in our current model. however, bovine rhodopsin is not an
adrenergic receptor, and  xxxg2318xxx , demonstrated by many groups

compounds covering 5.5 log units. nonspecific binding was defined
using 100 ␮m oxymetazoline. after 45 min at room temperature,

close analogs (table 1) to our model structure (salminen et al., 1999)
of ␣2a-ar. in general, the program will lead to the identification of
highly populated clusters corresponding to similar low-energy ligand-receptor complexes. because autodock only considers the enthalpic binding energy in its search for favorable orientations of
torsionally flexible ligands, the intermolecular interaction energy
function is not necessarily accurate in predicting the true binding
energy. thus, the cluster with the absolute minimum energy does
not necessarily represent the best or global energy minimum of the
ligand in the receptor binding-site, especially if the cluster is
sparsely populated. nonetheless, the method has been proven accurate enough to identify the possible conformations of ligand molecules at receptor binding sites (minke et al., 1999; rao and olson,
1999; salminen et al., 1999). indeed, a highly populated cluster of
similar conformations whose members are the result of many independent docking simulations suggests that the cluster is located at
an energy minimum that is easily accessible. moreover, a cluster
with a higher population is more likely to represent the natural
conformations of the ligand, even if a less populated cluster having a
slightly lower energy is present.
therefore, from 500 (norepinephrine and analogs with fewer degrees of freedom than epinephrine and analogs) to 800 (epinephrine
and analogs) separate docking simulations were made for each ligand, and the cluster with the highest population and the lowest
interaction energy was chosen as the representative conformation.
according to our own experience, the most populated clusters also
correlate best with other independent results, including the grid
maps and the ligand binding results. thus, in creating the representative binding modes for each of the ligands, we: 1) selected the
optimal docked conformations to the receptor (i.e., binding modes)
found after cluster analysis in autodock; 2) visualized the binding
modes on a graphics station superimposed with the grid maps,
choosing the binding mode that correlated best with these maps; 3)
then used the predicted binding mode to explain the ligand binding
and activity data; and 4) considered how well our model complexes
correlated with the existing ␣2a-ar ligand binding and activation
data.

results
a total of 12 phenethylamines (table 1), (r)-norepinephrine and five analogs (fig. 1, a and b) and (r)-epinephrine
and five analogs (fig. 1, c and d), were docked to the structural model (salminen et al., 1999) of ␣2a-ar (as indicated in
table 1, some s-isomers were not docked to the receptor
model). ki values for competition with the antagonist radioligand [3h]rx821002 to probe the lower affinity binding
state and with the agonist radioligand [3h]uk-14,304 to
probe the higher affinity binding state and receptor activation results (emax and ec50 values for [35s]gtp␥s binding in
isolated membranes) were determined experimentally for dopamine, (r)-norepinephrine, (s)-norepinephrine, (r)-epinephrine, (r)-norphenephrine, (s)-norphenephrine, (r)-octopamine, (s)-octopamine, and (r)-2-amino-1-phenyl-ethanol.
two additional agonist ligands, uk-14,304 and  xxxd201xxx , which are not phenethylamines but aminoimidazolines, were included for purposes of comparison. the results of these experiments are summarized in table 2. the
competition binding results obtained with the antagonist
radioligand [3h]rx821002 were calculated using both onesite and two-site models. two-site models were statistically
significantly superior (p ⬍ 0.05) to one-site models for (r)and (s)-norepinephrine, (r)-epinephrine, uk-14,304, and paminoclonidine. these two-site competition binding results
are shown in table 3.

mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm nacl, and 1 ␮m gdp; ph 7.4 at 25°c).
the reaction was started by adding an aliquot of membrane suspension (5 ␮g of membrane protein per well) to microwells containing
reaction buffer and 0.08 to 0.15 nm [35s]gtp␥s with agonist in a
total volume of 250 ␮l. the microwell plates were incubated for 25
min at room temperature. the incubation was terminated by rapid
filtration through glass fiber filters using a tomtec harvester 96
mach ii (tomtec, inc., hamden, ct). the filters were washed with
3 ⫻ 4 ml of cold wash buffer (20 mm tris-hcl, 5 mm mgcl2, and 1
mm edta; ph 7.4 at 4°c). the bound radioactivity was determined
in a 1205 betaplate liquid scintillation counter (wallac oy, turku,
finland).
␣2a-ar model and ligand models. the previously reported
model structure of ␣2a-ar was used in this study (salminen et al.,
1999). the model is based on an ␣-carbon template derived from the
low-resolution electron microscopy structure of frog rhodopsin and
the alignment of a large number of gpcrs (baldwin et al., 1997).
the ligand structures (table 1) were built with the program hyperchem version 5.01 (hypercube, inc., gainesville, fl) and optimized using a short 200 ps simulated annealing procedure described
elsewhere (salminen et al., 1999). after simulated annealing, the
ligands were energy minimized in vacuo using the mm⫹ (extended
mm2) force field.
automated docking. norepinephrine and epinephrine and their
analogs, a total of 12 different ligands, were automatically docked to
the ligand binding site of the ␣2a-ar model. the atomic partial
charges, required for the docking simulations, were assigned to atoms of both the ␣2a-ar model and the ligand set according to the
gasteiger method (gasteiger and marsili, 1980) implemented in
quanta 97 (molecular simulations, inc., san diego, ca). the computer program autodock version 2.4 (morris et al., 1996) was used to
dock the flexible small molecule ligands in the rigid ␣2a-ar receptor
model. conformational searches were limited to a 25 å3 volume
containing the ␣2a-ar ligand binding site and nearby residues. to
find low-energy conformations of ligands in the receptor binding site,
autodock uses monte carlo simulated annealing combined with a
rapid, atomic resolution, grid-based method of energy evaluation
using the amber forcefield and a distance-dependent dielectric
constant to account for the solvent effects.
docking parameters. the following scheme was used to seek
low-energy ligand conformations: 1) 500 to 800 separate docking
simulations were performed for each ligand; 2) for each simulation,
there were 100 constant temperature cycles with 8000 steps accepted
or rejected; 3) the initial simulation temperature (rt ⫽ 300 cal/mol,
where r ⫽ gas constant and t ⫽ absolute temperature) was reduced
by a factor of 0.97 in each cycle; and 4) flexibility of both the ligand
and the orientation of the ligand in the binding site was introduced
by allowing torsional rotation and molecule translation steps for the
ligands of 15° and 0.2 å, respectively, reduced by a factor of 0.97 in
each cycle. in this way, over 107 docked ligand-receptor conformations were evaluated for each ligand. next, the docked structures
were clustered into similar groups that differ by less than 1 å
root-mean-square deviation from each other at the binding site.
grid calculations. the computer program grid version 16
(goodford, 1985) was used to map essential interactions in the binding site of the ␣2a-ar model. grid calculates energies of interaction
between a chemical probe and the receptor. the probes used in this
study mimic charged and neutral amino groups, (phenolic) hydroxyl
groups, methyl groups, aromatic carbons, and hydrophobic groups.
probes were placed at positions throughout a 30 å ⫻ 30 å ⫻ 30 å
cube (3 points/å, 27 points/å3) centered at the ␣2a-ar ligand binding
site, and the interaction energies were calculated at each point. the
flexibility of amino acid side chains of the ␣2a-ar model was considered in the evaluation of the interaction energy. the grid maps
were visualized using the program cerius 2 (molecular simulations, inc.) and gopenmol (bergman et al., 1997).

autodock was used to dock epinephrine, norepinephrine, and their

the phenethylamine analogs differ from each other by
either missing one or more hydroxyl groups (␤-oh, and catecholic meta- and para-oh groups) and/or in their chirality

be divided into six chemical domains whose interactions with
␣2a-ar can be classified: the positively charged amine group,

the positively charged amine group. with norepinephrine and its analogs, the most important interaction is
formed between the positively charged amine group (fig. 3)
of the ligands and the negatively charged side chain carboxyl
group of asp113 (d3.32) in  xxxg2318xxx  of the receptor (wang et al.,
1991; kobilka, 1995). in general, the interactions between
asp113 (d3.32) and the amine group in the ligands should be
strong and anchor the amine group close to that residue, as
observed in the docking simulations (fig. 1). the grid calculations also indicated a large volume near asp113 (d3.32)
where charged and neutral amine groups could be placed
with favorable interaction energy. the electrostatic surface
potential shown in fig. 2, b and c, clearly shows the region
of negative charge about asp113 (d3.32) in the receptor’s
ligand binding site.
the n-methyl group in epinephrine and analogs.
the n-methyl group (fig. 3) in epinephrine and its analogs
packs against phe411 and phe412 (f7.38 and f7.39) in tm7 in
the docking simulations (fig. 1, c and d). grid maps also
show that those parts of tm7 exposed to the binding cavity
are favorable for hydrophobic, aromatic and methyl contacts.
the presence of the n-methyl group in epinephrine and analogs would be predicted to improve the binding affinity by
making an additional hydrophobic contact with phe411
(f7.38) and phe412 (f7.39) in tm7. indeed, the affinity of
(r)-epinephrine is 4 times higher than the affinity of (r)norepinephrine in [3h]rx821002 binding studies and 3 times

competition binding and functional assay results
the binding (ki) and activation (ec50) values are presented for molecules that were commercially available, either as pure enantiomers or as racemic mixtures that were
subsequently resolved into their separate pure enantiomers. in the case of the epinephrines, only (r)-epinephrine was available from a commercial source. two separate
binding assays were used with competition against [3h]rx821002 and [3h]uk-14,304: the apparent ki is the inhibition constant for a one-site model. in the assays with
[3h]rx821002, two-site fits were statistically significantly superior to one-site fits only for (r)- and (s)-norepinephrine, (r)-epinephrine, uk-14,304 and  xxxd201xxx 
(table 3). the functional assay is based on measurement of agonist-induced binding of [35s]gtp␥s to ␣2a-ar-coupled g-proteins in isolated membranes. ec50 values of
agonists are reported. ki and ec50 ratios are the values reported for a ligand divided by that seen for (r)-norepinephrine. values in parentheses are emax relative to

para- and meta-catecholic oh groups. by dividing the ligands into six individual domains, we sought to understand
the effect that each of these six chemical groups has on
binding affinity and activation of ␣2a-ar.
over 107 ligand conformations were studied to produce
each ligand-receptor complex model. to obtain the representative receptor-ligand complexes, we selected optimal docked
poses found after cluster analysis in autodock and visualization of the binding modes on a graphics workstation together
with the grid ligand affinity maps of the receptor binding
site. the predicted binding modes of this set of ligands based
on docking simulations, when taken in combination with
experimental results on binding and receptor activation,
makes it possible to assign functional roles to the chemical
groups of the ligands, as well as to the receptor itself. figure
2 shows the overall location of the ligand binding site on the
model structure.
we have thus used a series of very similar ligand molecules
that are sequentially missing different functional groups.
because we have an accurate structural model for the mode
of binding between each ligand and the receptor, we can then
correlate the observed structural differences of the ligands
and ligand-receptor interactions with the similarities and
differences in the experimental data. this then permits us to
discriminate between those interactions that are important
for binding affinity and those interactions that help to stabilize the activated form of the receptor.

molecular mechanism for ␣2a-ar activation

higher in the [3h]uk-14,304 assay (table 2). the rank order
of affinity of (r)-epinephrine and (r)-norepinephrine is, however, the opposite for the high-affinity binding site population as revealed in a two-site analysis of the [3h]rx821002
competition results (table 3). furthermore, the ec50 values
measured for stimulation of [35s]gtp␥s binding are quite
similar for (r)-epinephrine and (r)-norepinephrine (table 2).
thus, the n-methyl group affects the binding affinity to the
low-affinity receptor conformation, but is not directly coupled
to the activation process.
the ␤-oh group. with both (r)-epinephrine and (r)norepinephrine, the ␤-oh group (fig. 3) is positioned in a
way that it can form a hydrogen bond with one side chain

oxygen of asp113 (d3.32) (fig. 1). consistent with this view,
the grid maps calculated for ␣2a-ar indicate a favorable
interaction for a hydroxyl group within a volume above (toward the extracellular surface) and at the level of the plane
of the side chain oxygens of asp113 (d3.32). the interactions
between ␣2a-ar and the ␤-oh are unlikely to be any further
than 4 to 5 å away from asp113 (d3.32) because of the
restrictions imposed by the ligand geometry. if the amine
group in (r)-norepinephrine interacts with asp113 (d3.32),
and the catecholic end of the ligand is oriented toward residues in  xxxg2318xxx , it is also not possible for the ␤-oh to interact
with ser90 (s2.61) in tm2. the ␤-oh group would thus not
point toward tm2, as suggested by previous mutagenesis
studies (li et al., 1995), but would be located on the opposite
side of the ligand, pointing toward asp113 (d3.32) in  xxxg2318xxx .
in the docking simulations, the ␤-oh group in each of the
r-isomers forms a hydrogen bond to asp113 (d3.32) (fig. 2),
whereas in the s-enantiomers of epinephrine and norepinephrine and their analogs, the favorable interactions with
asp113 (d3.32) cannot take place. consistent with this, the ki
values of the s-isomers of norepinephrine and its analogs,
derived from competitive radioligand binding assays, are
larger than those of the r-enantiomers. the affinity of dopamine (no ␤-oh group) is also clearly lower than that of
(r)-norepinephrine (table 2). the ki values of (s)-norphenephrine and (s)-octopamine were only slightly larger than
those of the r-isomers (1.3-fold difference in competition
assays with [3h]rx821002), which is a smaller difference
than that seen between (s)-norepinephrine and (r)-norepinephrine (4-fold). in the [3h]uk-14,304 competition binding
assays, however, the affinity differences between the (s)- and
r-isomers were much greater (8- to 22-fold). an even greater
affinity difference was seen when the [3h]rx821002 binding
results were fit to a two-site competition binding model.
two-site fits were statistically significantly superior to onesite fits only for (r)- and (s)-norepinephrine, (r)-epinephrine, uk-14,304, and  xxxd201xxx  (table 3). for both
(r)- and (s)-norepinephrine, the proportion of high-affinity
sites was approximately 30%, but whereas the affinity difference between the stereoisomers was approximately 4-fold for
the low-affinity receptor population (4,400 ⫾ 400 vs.
17,200 ⫾ 500 nm), the corresponding difference for the highaffinity receptor population was much greater, 2000-fold
(0.5 ⫾ 0.1 vs. 1000 ⫾ 400 nm). thus, the s-isomers do not
seem to be as effective in stabilizing the high-affinity form of
the receptor as the corresponding r-isomers. the large affinity differences observed in the [3h]uk-14,304 competition
assays between the s- and r-isomers may reflect the unfavorable orientation of the ␤-oh group in the s-isomers with
respect to the ligand binding site of the active form of ␣2a-ar.
this notion is supported by the results obtained for dopamine
in the [3h]uk-14,304 assay, because its binding affinity was
intermediate to those of (s)-norepinephrine and (r)-norepinephrine.
absence of the ␤-oh group, as in dopamine, removes the
possibility for a hydrogen bond to contact asp113 (d3.32),
found for the r-isomers of norepinephrine and epinephrine
and their analogs. in the docking simulations, the ␤-carbon of
dopamine is placed close to the bottom of the binding cavity
and in the same position as the ␤-oh is placed in (s)-norepinephrine (fig. 1, a and b). in our ␣2a-ar model of the
inactive form of the receptor, there is free space to place a

the receptor conformation is switched to the g-protein activating state.

small downward-pointing group between asp113 (d3.32) and
cys117 (c3.36) in  xxxg2318xxx . on the other hand, dopamine, without
an interaction between a ␤-oh and asp113 (d3.32), is conformationally more flexible than (s)-norepinephrine, which may
affect its ability to activate the receptor. in docking epineph-

rine analogs lacking the ␤-oh group (fig. 1, c and d), the
␤-oh contact with asp113 (d3.32) in  xxxg2318xxx  is removed. the
n-methyl group bends slightly upward, the ligand packs
more toward tm7, and a hydrogen bond between the amine
group and asp113 (d3.32) side chain oxygens is optimized.

tm7. c, the two possible orientations of the catechol ring found in this study (light color: alternative docked conformation; dark color: conformation

extracellular surface (rotamer with dark color) and thus interacts with ser200 (s5.42) in the active receptor conformation.

molecular mechanism for ␣2a-ar activation

ues of (r)-norepinephrine and (r)-norphenephrine, (r)-octopamine, and (r)-amino-1-phenyl-ethanol were only 5-, 7-,
and 2-fold, respectively, in the antagonist competition assays
with [3h]rx821002 (table 2). (r)-amino-1-phenyl-ethanol
was able to bind quite well to the receptor, although it has no
catecholic oh groups, but the complex was inactive in the
functional assay. the loss of affinity at the high-affinity
receptor conformation after removal of one or both catecholic
hydroxyl groups was more dramatic when two-site fits were
attempted for the [3h]rx821002 competition binding results
(compared with the [3h]uk-14,304 competition results): the
[3h]rx821002 competition curves were steep and monophasic, and no high-affinity component could be modeled for the
binding results of (r)- or (s)-octopamine, (r)- or (s)-norphenephrine, or (r)-2-amino-1-phenyl-ethanol (not shown). the
other investigated ␣2a-ar ligands,  xxxd201xxx  and
uk-14,304, are 2–3 å longer than the phenethylamines and
can more easily form good contacts with residues from both
 xxxg2318xxx  and  xxxg2318xxx  than can the phenethylamines. this may
partly explain the high binding affinity and efficacy of these
agonists.
despite the marginal contribution of the catecholic oh
groups toward the binding affinity for the low-affinity ligandbinding form of the receptor as probed by the [3h]rx821002
competition ligand assays, the catecholic hydroxyls seem to
be very important for receptor activation (table 2): (r)-amino-1-phenyl-ethanol (no catechol-oh) is incapable of activating ␣2a-ar as evidenced by the [35s]gtp␥s binding results.
(r)-norphenephrine (missing the para-oh group) is a partial
agonist with 14-fold lower potency and only about 30% relative efficacy in activating ␣2a-ar, compared with (r)-norepinephrine. similarly, (r)-octopamine, missing the meta-oh
group, has 110-fold lower potency and about 50% efficacy in
activating ␣2a-ar compared with (r)-norepinephrine.
dopamine, although having both catecholic oh groups,
is missing the anchoring ␤-oh group. the ␤-oh group,
present in either the (r)- or (s)-configuration in the other
phenylethylamine ligands studied here, limits the conformational flexibility of the ligand through its interactions
with the receptor. in dopamine, no such group exists and
dopamine can rotate to provide a number of different conformations that would not affect the ligand’s interactions
with asp113 (d3.32) or interactions between the ligand’s
aromatic ring and hydrophobic amino acids lining the
binding pocket. consequently, dopamine has a higher
binding affinity than (s)-norepinephrine in the competition binding assays (table 2). on the other hand, the
conformational freedom present in dopamine would clearly
affect the positioning of the catecholic oh groups with
respect to residue side chains in  xxxg2318xxx . this is reflected in
the 5-fold reduction in functional potency in comparison
with (s)-norepinephrine, and even more dramatic loss of
function compared with (r)-norepinephrine. this proposal
is supported by the results of activation assays using a
conformationally restricted dopamine analog, 2-amino-6,7dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphtalene: in [35s]gtp␥s
assays, this analog (ec50 ⫽ 309 nm) is 13-fold more potent
in activating ␣2a-ar than is (s)-norepinephrine (s.
wurster, unpublished results). dopamine also achieves
full efficacy in comparison with (r)-norepinephrine in the
functional [35s]gtp␥s binding assays, which is thus attributed to the presence of both catecholic oh groups.

taken together, the differences in binding affinities between the s- and r-enantiomers (table 2; ruffolo, 1991), and
the mechanistic explanation provided by our docking simulations strongly suggest that the ␤-oh provides an important
contribution toward the binding affinity of ␤-oh-phenethylamines at ␣2a-ar and probably also to other adrenergic
receptors. the results of our analysis (fig. 1) suggest that
this contribution of the ␤-oh to binding affinity of the risomers occurs through coordination with the side chain of
asp113 (d3.32).
the aromatic ring. optimal placement of the aromatic
ring, present in all of the investigated ligands, is with the
ring plane packed against tm6, with additional interactions
with  xxxg2318xxx  and  xxxg2318xxx  (figs. 1 and 3). grid calculations predict
favorable aromatic group interactions between  xxxg2318xxx  and
tm6, induced by the aromatic side chains of phe391 (f6.52)
and tyr394 (y6.55) in tm6, both of which are conserved in all
␣2-ar subtypes, and partially by the side chains of phe205
(f5.47) and cys201 (c5.43) in  xxxg2318xxx  (fig. 1). on the opposite
face of the docked conformation of the aromatic ring lies
another conserved residue, val114 (v3.33) in  xxxg2318xxx . aromatic
rings, for example the adenine ring, are often seen sandwiched between valine or another hydrophobic residue on one
face of the ring and aromatic residues on the opposite face of
the ring (denessiouk and johnson, 2000). the catecholic oh
groups (see below) are very likely to be in contact with
thr118 (t3.37) in  xxxg2318xxx  and cys201 (c5.43) in  xxxg2318xxx , and are
oriented toward  xxxg2318xxx  where ser200 (s5.42) and ser204 (s5.46)
are located; interactions with these groups would affect the
orientation of the aromatic ring when docked.
the para- and meta-catecholic oh groups. in the
docking simulations, the two catecholic oh groups (fig. 3)
contact residue side chains within  xxxg2318xxx  and  xxxg2318xxx , and thus
influence the orientation of the aromatic ring. in the docking
simulations, coordination can take place between catecholic
hydroxyls and the side chains of thr118 (t3.37) in  xxxg2318xxx ; and
ser200 (s5.42), ser204 (s5.46), and cys201 (c5.43) in  xxxg2318xxx . of
the latter three residues, we believe that only cys201 is
exposed to the binding cavity in the low-affinity or inactive
form of the receptor (fig. 1). in the activated or higher affinity form of the receptor, we suggest that rotation of  xxxg2318xxx 
occurs and exposes both ser200 (s5.42) and ser204 (s5.46) to
the ligand-binding cavity (marjamäki et al., 1999; salminen
et al., 1999). because of this rotation, good contacts are
formed between the meta-oh and para-oh and ser200
(s5.42) and ser204 (s5.46) (fig. 3). due to the inaccuracies in
the docking forcefield, the distinction between the two possible orientations of the catecholic ring in ␣2a-ar is difficult.
the calculated energy difference between two possible ligand
conformations, which differ in that the catechol ring is
flipped by 180°, is too small to distinguish between the two
conformations. because mutagenesis studies (wang et al.,
1991; rudling et al., 1999) have indicated that the meta-oh
is likely to interact with ser200 (s5.42) and the para-hydroxyl
with ser204 (s5.46) in ␣2a-ar, and because this orientation
also is in agreement with results obtained with other adrenergic receptors (strader et al., 1989, hwa and perez, 1996),
the modeled orientation of the catechol ring was adjusted to
correspond to these results (fig. 3).
the catecholic hydroxyls do not seem to be critically important for the binding affinity of the phenethylamines to the
low-affinity state of ␣2a-ar. differences between the ki val-

rx821002 and uk-14,304 probe different activation
states of the receptor. we have used two different ligandbinding assays in this study. [3h]rx821002 is an antagonist
ligand, which mainly probes the predominant inactive state
of the receptor, whereas [3h]uk-14,304 is an ␣2a-ar agonist,
which probes the activated receptor. both ligands are superficially similar, especially with regard to the imidazole end,
which is likely to bind to asp113 (d3.32). at its opposite end,
rx821002 has an unsubstituted phenyl ring, which can only
participate in hydrophobic and aromatic interactions. these
interactions are presumably not capable of stabilizing the
activated form of the receptor. in contrast, uk-14,304 has
two aromatic ring nitrogens that can participate in interactions that can help to promote or to maintain an activated
conformation. this contrasts with  xxxd201xxx , a less
potent and efficacious agonist than uk-14,304:  xxxd201xxx  has a single amine group extending from the phenyl ring that can make one stabilizing set of polar interactions with the receptor, instead of the two possible with
uk-14,304.  xxxd201xxx  is also shorter than
uk-14,304. it is important to consider these aspects in the
analysis of the data presented here.
ligand binding affinity. the predicted location of the
ligand binding site of ␣2a-ar and a set of representative
phenethylamine binding modes are presented in figs. 2 and
3. according to the easson-stedman hypothesis, an adrenoceptor should have three functional points in its binding site
to accommodate the charged aliphatic nitrogen, the ␤-oh
group, and the aromatic ring of phenethylamine ligands [see
ruffolo (1991) for a detailed discussion]. in our model (fig. 2),
these interactions are primarily contributed by residues in
 xxxg2318xxx ,  xxxg2318xxx , and tm6 (fig. 3). in addition, we suggest that
residues in tm7 should have a role in ligand binding in the
case of epinephrine and analogs (fig. 3).
the details of the attachment of phenethylamine ligands to
their receptors (fig. 3) are now suggested by us to include the
following interactions for ␣2a-ar. first, the charged amine
group would be optimally coordinated to one side chain oxygen of asp113 (d3.32) in  xxxg2318xxx ; the importance of this interaction has been well documented (wang et al., 1991; kobilka,
1995; bikker et al., 1998; gether and kobilka, 1998). additionally, ␣2a-ar binds (r)-epinephrine with a higher binding
affinity in comparison to (r)-norepinephrine, and we attribute this to the additional contacts formed between the
n-methyl group of epinephrine and the hydrophobic residues
phe411 (f7.38) and phe412 (f7.39) in tm7. second, with the
r-isomers, the ␤-oh group would form a hydrogen bond with
the other side chain oxygen of asp113 (d3.32). unfortunately,
this proposition cannot be directly tested with site-directed
substitution mutagenesis, because the aspartate is required
for receptor functionality. receptor-ligand docking results
suggest that s-isomerism at the ␤-carbon causes the ␤-oh
group to be oriented in a direction opposite to that seen for
the r-isomers, resulting in the loss of one easson-stedman
contact point and reflected in poorer binding in comparison
with the r-isomers (table 1; ruffolo, 1991). grid calculations also suggest that weaker interactions occur for the
s-isomers because the ␤-oh group would be placed within a
volume below asp113 (d3.32), indicated to be slightly hydrophobic, probably due to the presence of the nearby side

chains of phe116 (f3.35) and cys117 (c3.36). cys117 (c3.36) in
 xxxg2318xxx  is in close proximity to the amine end of the ligands and
may contribute to the binding site environment, too, but its
role was not clarified in the current study. dopamine, which
lacks the ␤-oh group, behaves in a manner similar to the
s-isomers in that it binds poorly to ␣2a-ar and possibly due
to conformational flexibility only activates ␣2a-ar with low
potency (table 2).
third, the phenyl group of the phenethylamine ligands
would pack (␲-␲ stacking interactions) with one ring face
against conserved aromatic residues in tm6, tyr394 (y6.55)
and phe391 (f6.52), and possibly phe205 (f5.47) in  xxxg2318xxx ; and
with val114 (v3.33) in  xxxg2318xxx  packing against the other face of
the ring (fig. 3). the ␣2a-ar binding site is rich in aromatic
residues: the side chains of phe205 (f5.47) in  xxxg2318xxx , phe391
(f6.52) and tyr394 (y6.55) in tm6, and phe411 (f7.38) and
phe412 (f7.39) in tm7 are accessible to ligands in the binding
cavity. in our model, a network of aromatic interactions could
form if small adjustments took place in the orientations of
the side chains of these residues. as indicated by our previous studies (marjamäki et al., 1999; salminen et al., 1999),
cys201 (c5.43), ser200 (s5.42), and ser204 (s5.46) in  xxxg2318xxx  of
␣2a-ar also have important roles both in orienting and binding ligands.
the deletion of one or both of the catecholic hydroxyl
groups from (r)-norepinephrine results in 2- to 7-fold lower
(competition assay using [3h]rx821002, which mainly
probes the predominant “low-affinity” inactive receptor conformation) and 28- to 146-fold lower (competition assay using
[3h]uk-14,304, thought to probe the “high-affinity” active
conformation of the receptor) binding affinity. (r)-amino-1phenyl-ethanol has the aliphatic amine group, the ␤-oh
group, and the phenyl ring in the correct orientation, and
binds relatively well to ␣2a-ar; but, it lacks efficacy in activating the receptor because it has no catecholic oh groups
(as reflected in [3h]uk-14,304 competition assays and functional assays; table 2). thus, it seems that the catecholic oh
groups have a more important role in receptor activation
than in ligand binding. in the phenethylamines, the catecholic oh groups most probably interact with cys201 (c5.43)
in  xxxg2318xxx . the para-oh group may also coordinate to thr118
(t3.37) in  xxxg2318xxx  if the catecholic ring is positioned as described
previously. furthermore, the catecholic hydroxyl groups
would be able to form intimate contacts with ser200 (s5.42)
and ser204 (s5.46) in  xxxg2318xxx , if  xxxg2318xxx  rotates clockwise (viewed
from the extracellular surface) with respect to  xxxg2318xxx  and tm6,
exposing ser200 (s5.42) and ser204 (s5.46) to the ligandbinding cavity, thus enabling  xxxg2318xxx  and  xxxg2318xxx  to move closer
toward each other (figs. 3 and 4). this dramatic change in
the structure of the receptor would certainly be reflected as
structural alterations at the inner membrane surface, because intracellular loop 3, accepted to be intimately involved
in g-protein activation (jewell-motz et al., 1998), is located
between  xxxg2318xxx  and tm6. this proposal is supported by the
observed effects of alkylating agents of different sizes targeted to cysteine substitutions engineered along  xxxg2318xxx  (marjamäki et al., 1999), and by modeling and ligand binding
studies involving these mutant receptors (salminen et al.,
1999). we also have supporting evidence for this notion from
recent experiments involving the same phenylethylamine
(r)- and s-enantiomers used in the present study, and the
engineered  xxxg2318xxx  serine-to-cysteine substitutions used in our

molecular mechanism for ␣2a-ar activation

fig. 4. proposed mechanism for agonist-independent activation and agonist-induced ␣2a-ar activation by norepinephrine and epinephrine. a,
agonist-independent activation of receptor (r) proceeds through a conformational change involving  xxxg2318xxx ,  xxxg2318xxx , and tm6. this conformational
change would be transmitted to the intracellular loops that can then bind
and activate the g-protein complex (␣␤␥). the energy barrier for this
transition would probably be high such that the population of activated
receptor (r*) capable of binding g-proteins (g) in the absence of ligand
(l) would be low. this low concentration of activated receptor would,
however, be able to bind tightly to agonists (stars) presented to them (b,
right-hand side). in the case of agonist ligands, the equilibrium would
favor the formation of the activated ligand-bound complex (l*r*),
whereas antagonists (circles) with  xxxd1422xxx  activity would shift the
equilibrium in favor of the inactive receptor form (lr).

the orientation of the aromatic ring is locked into place by
these nonpolar interactions and very probably through interactions between the catecholic oh groups and thr118 (t3.37)
in  xxxg2318xxx ; and ser200 (s5.42), cys201 (c5.43), and ser204 (s5.46)
in  xxxg2318xxx .
in our model of the inactive receptor conformation, the
length of the phenethylamine ligands is too short to reach
easily both asp113 (d3.32) in  xxxg2318xxx  and the polar residues in
 xxxg2318xxx  (cys201 (c5.43), ser200 (s5.42), and ser204 (s5.46)) without structural alterations. the length of the ligands does
affect their ability to bind to ␣2a-ar (salminen et al., 1999),
because longer ligands such as uk-14,304 and  xxxd201xxx  can more easily interact with both asp113 (d3.32) in
 xxxg2318xxx  and ser200 (s5.42), cys201 (c5.43), and ser204 (s5.46) in
 xxxg2318xxx . aromatic nitrogens in uk-14,304 and the amino group
in  xxxd201xxx  are able to interact with ser200 (s5.42),
cys201 (c5.43), and ser204 (s5.46) in  xxxg2318xxx  in the active form
of the receptor; with rx821002, polar interactions with  xxxg2318xxx 
probably cannot be formed. thus, we propose that the final
stage in phenethylamine ligand binding to the inactive receptor conformation is coupled to the transition of the ␣2a-ar
inactive state to the g-protein activation state, which is then
stabilized by phenethylamine ligands that have catecholic
oh groups. the activation of ␣2a-ar can be envisioned as a
rotation that exposes both  xxxg2318xxx  serines to the ligand binding
cavity and movement of  xxxg2318xxx  toward the ligand,  xxxg2318xxx , and
tm6. this would substantially increase the number of interactions with the ligand and could be the mechanism by which
structural alterations are transmitted to the third intracellular loop, and by which the equilibrium between inactive
and active receptor conformations is shifted in favor of the
g-protein activating state (see figs. 3 and 4). in support of
this model, our ligand binding results (table 2) indicate that
the catecholic oh groups are not so critical for binding, but
are very important for receptor activation. additionally, our
previous studies strongly suggested that alkylating reagents
of different sizes designed to specifically react with engineered cysteines at positions 200 and 204 recognized two
different conformations of ␣2a-ar (marjamäki et al., 1999)
and that rotation of  xxxg2318xxx  is likely to be involved (salminen et
al., 1999). an equilibrium model for receptor activation
would suggest that a fraction of the total receptor population
could, in the absence of ligands, spontaneously be in this
activated conformation. a diagram describing the equilibrium between inactive and active receptor states in the presence and absence of agonist is presented in fig. 4, along with
the changes in the relative disposition of residues that are
suggested to occur upon activation (fig. 3). this model for
receptor activation can also rationalize the effects of partial
agonists of ␣2a-ar. partial agonists may either stabilize an
intermediate state, or their ability to favor the necessary
conformational changes could be limited.
in summary, we have constructed a model that correlates
well with the current published information on ␣2a-ar. the
results we present offer a detailed view of the activation of
␣2a-ar by (r)-phenethylamines. this model is based both on
extensive computer simulations and in vitro experiments
probing both binding affinity and receptor activation using a
set of structurally closely analogous ␣2a-ar ligands. the
small differences within the ligand sets allow us to evaluate
the role of each part of the ligand molecule in terms of the
proposed interactions with key conserved amino acids lining

previous studies (marjamäki et al., 1999; salminen et al.,
1999).
receptor activation. gether and kobilka (1998) have
suggested a general model for the activation of rhodopsin-like
gpcrs. we propose a similar but more detailed scheme for
the activation of ␣2a-ar by (r)-phenethylamines (figs. 3 and
4). we suggest that binding of a phenethylamine to ␣2a-ar is
initiated by the formation of a hydrogen bond between the
negatively charged carboxylate in asp113 (d3.32) in  xxxg2318xxx  and
the positively charged aliphatic amine group in the ligand.
the n-methyl group of epinephrine increases the binding
affinity through nonpolar interactions with hydrophobic residues in tm7. the interaction between the ligand and
␣2a-ar is enforced by the formation of another hydrogen
bond between the ␤-oh of the ligand and the other oxygen in
the asp113 (d3.32) side chain. the agonist is oriented within
the binding site so that the aromatic ring is sandwiched
between the aromatic interactions with tyr394 (y6.55) and
phe391 (f6.52) in tm6 and possibly phe205 (f5.47) in  xxxg2318xxx ,
and hydrophobic interactions with val114 (v3.33) in  xxxg2318xxx .

the binding cavity of the receptor itself. the model is consistent with and updates the easson-stedman hypothesis for
catecholamine binding to the ␣2-type adrenoceptors (ruffolo,
1991), and the activation follows a scheme as described in
general for the rhodopsin-like gpcrs (gether and kobilka,
1998).
