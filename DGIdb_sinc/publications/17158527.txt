introduction
arsenic, an element that is found both in native and in combined form,
has been used medicinally for over 2400 years. in the 19th century, it
was the mainstay of the materia medica. a solution of potassium
arsenite (fowler’s solution) was used for a variety of systemic illnesses from the 18th until the 20th century. this multipurpose solution was also the primary therapy for the treatment of chronic
myelogenous leukemia until it was replaced by radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy. the past 100 years have seen a precipitous decline in arsenic use; by the mid-1990s, the only recognized indication
was the treatment of trypanosomiasis. much of this decline was due to
concerns about the toxicity and potential carcinogenicity of chronic
arsenic administration (1). chinese physicians had been using arseniccontaining medicines, including  xxxd226xxx , as part of a treatment

inorganic arsenic (arsenite and arsenate) in drinking water has
been associated with skin cancers and increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases. additionally, studies have demonstrated the
pro-angiogenic effect of arsenite and its potential promotion of
tumor angiogenesis and tumor progression. furthermore, recent
reports demonstrated reversal of skin co-carcinogenesis by an
organoselenium compound. the present study was undertaken
to determine the effect and mechanism on angiogenesis of arsenite
at low level and its potential reversal by various selenium-derived
compounds. the pro-angiogenesis effects and mechanisms of sodium arsenite were determined using the chick chorioallantoic
membrane (cam) model over 3 days and compared with standard pro-angiogenesis factors, such as basic fibroblast growth
factor (b-fgf). additionally, the potential effect of various selenium-derived compounds—such as dimethyl selenone, diphenyl
selenone, sodium selenite or se-methyl selenocysteine—in reversing the pro-angiogenesis effect of arsenite or b-fgf was also
determined in the cam model. the pro-angiogenesis effect of
arsenite or b-fgf was significantly (p , 0.01) blocked by dimethyl selenone, diphenyl selenone, sodium selenite or se-methyl
selenocysteine. the pro-angiogenesis effect of either sodium arsenite at 33 nm or b-fgf was blocked (p , 0.01) by the extracellular
signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2) activation inhibitor, pd
98059. additionally, the pro-angiogenic effect of arsenic or b-fgf
was blocked as well (p , 0.01) by the avb3 antagonist, xt199.
these data suggest that the pro-angiogenesis effect of arsenic is
initiated at the plasma membrane integrin avb3, involves activation of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway and is effectively reversed by various
selenium-derived compounds.

for acute  xxxg1785xxx  (apl). their accumulated experience showed that a stable solution of  xxxd226xxx  given by intravenous infusion was remarkably effective both in patients with
newly diagnosed apl and in those with refractory and relapsed
apl (2). the mechanisms of action of arsenic derivatives in this
disease and other malignancies are many and include induction of
apoptosis, inhibition of proliferation and inhibition of angiogenesis
(2). molecular studies and ongoing clinical trials suggest that, as
a chemotherapeutic agent,  xxxd226xxx  shows great promise in
the treatment of malignant diseases (2).
 xxxd226xxx  can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in
multiple myeloma cells in vitro and in vivo (3). however, low concentrations of  xxxd226xxx  stimulate vascular cell proliferation in
cell culture and angiogenesis in vivo (4,5). arsenite was shown to
cause dose-dependent increase in vessel density in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (cam) assay (5). the threshold  xxxd226xxx 
concentration for this response was 0.033 lm, and inhibition of vessel
growth was observed at concentrations .1 lm (5). hence, arsenite
might have carcinogenic effect at low levels of exposure, which might
be accelerated by its pro-angiogenesis effects.
data supported a potential anti-angiogenic effect of selenium in
the chemoprevention of cancer (6,7). with regard to tumor angiogenesis, the chemopreventive effect of increased selenium intake on
chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis has been associated
with reduced intratumoral microvessel density (6). control of angiogenesis is a complex process involving local release of vascular
growth factors, the extracellular matrix, adhesion molecules and
metabolic factors (7–9). mechanical forces within blood vessels
may also play a role (7). the principal endogenous growth factors
implicated in new blood vessel growth are the fibroblast growth
factor (fgf) family and  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf)
(10). the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signal transduction cascade (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2
[ xxxg1369xxx /2]) is known to be involved both in vegf gene expression
and in control of proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (10). the
availability of a chick cam model of angiogenesis (10–14) allowed
us to define the effect of low levels of sodium arsenite and its potential mechanism of actions.
in this report, we describe a pro-angiogenesis effect of  xxxd226xxx  that is comparable with that of basic fgf (b-fgf) or vegf in
the cam model. we also provide evidence that representative selenium compounds reverse the pro-angiogenesis effect of arsenic,
which is initiated at the endothelial cell plasma membrane, involves
a plasma membrane integrin avb3 receptor and is mediated by activation of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 signal transduction pathway.

arsenic, selenium and angiogenesis modulation

needle, a small hole was made in the shell at the air sac, and a second hole was
made on the long side of the egg, directly over an avascular portion of the
embryonic membrane that was identified by candling. a false air sac was
created beneath the second hole by distal application of negative pressure,
so that the cam separated from the shell. a window 1.0 cm2 was cut in
the shell over the dropped cam, allowing direct access to the underlying
membrane. sodium arsenite in comparison with standard pro-angiogenic
stimuli b-fgf (1 lg/ml) and vegf (2 lg/ml) was used. sterile disks of
#1 filter paper (whatman international, kent, uk) were pre-treated with 3
mg/ml  xxxd1754xxx  and air-dried under sterile conditions. sodium arsenite, b-fgf, vegf or control vehicle and inhibitors were then applied to the
disks; the disks were allowed to dry, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) and placed on the cams. filters treated with thyroid hormone and
analogs, sodium arsenite, b-fgf or vegf were placed on the first day of
the 3-day incubation, and selenium analogs were added 30 min later to selected
arsenite-treated cams. at 24 h, the mapk cascade inhibitor pd 98059 or the
avb3 integrin antagonist xt199 or the various selenium-containing compounds were also added to the cams pre-treated with arsenite or b-fgf, by
means of the filter disks.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance comparing
each experimental group with its respective control group. the statistical significance was defined as p , 0.05.

results
effect of arsenic on angiogenesis
sodium arsenite at 33 nm resulted in a significant (p , 0.01) stimulation
of angiogenesis in the cam model that is comparable with that obtained
with b-fgf or vegf (figure 1a and b).
effect of selenium-containing compounds on arsenic-induced
angiogenesis
the pro-angiogenesis effect of arsenite was significantly (p , 0.01)
blocked by various selenium-containing compounds  xxxd1891xxx  lmoles of
either dimethyl selenone or diphenyl selenone (figure 2a and b).
similarly, either dimethyl selenone or diphenyl selenone significantly
(p , 0.01) blocked b-fgf-induced angiogenesis in the cam model
(figure 3a and b). likewise, 10 lmoles of either sodium selenite or
se-methyl selenocysteine significantly inhibited arsenite-induced angiogenesis (figure 4a–c) or b-fgf-induced angiogenesis (figure
5a–c) in the cam model.
there was greater efficacy in reversing arsenite pro-angiogenesis at
the same molar doses (10 lmoles) by dimethyl selenone as compared
with diphenyl selenone. additionally, sodium selenite demonstrated
greater efficacy as compared with se-methyl selenocysteine. similar
efficacy was demonstrated for these various selenium-derived compounds in reversing b-fgf-mediated angiogenesis (figures 2–5).
the  xxxg1369xxx /2 signal transduction pathway in stimulation of
angiogenesis by arsenic
sodium arsenite at 33 nm caused a two-fold increase in blood vessel
branching, a response that was effectively blocked (p , 0.01) by the
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activation inhibitor, pd 98059 (figures 6a and b). we have

shown previously that b-fgf stimulation of branch formation was
also blocked by this inhibitor of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation (14).
the role of integrin avb3 in arsenic-mediated angiogenesis
the integrin avb3 antagonist xt199 is known to inhibit b-fgf stimulation of angiogenesis in the cam assay (14). the pro-angiogenic
effect of arsenic is blocked (p , 0.01) by the avb3 antagonist, xt199
(figures 6a and b), and thus the pro-angiogenesis effect of arsenic is
initiated at the plasma membrane integrin avb3 and involves activation of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway to promote b-fgf release from endothelial cells.
discussion
animal studies showed that arsenite alone is not a complete carcinogen (with the exception of some transplacental studies by the
waalkes laboratory [16]). skin tumors are the most frequent arsenic-associated tumors in humans. arsenite (and arsenate, which is
converted to arsenite) acts to enhance the carcinogencity of other
agents (17). one possible way that an agent can enhance carcinogenesis without being a complete carcinogen is by enhancing angiogenesis, as demonstrated in this investigation. inorganic arsenic (arsenite
and arsenate) in drinking water has been associated with skin cancers
in several countries, such as taiwan, chile, argentina, bangladesh
and mexico. this association has not been established in the usa. in
addition, inorganic arsenic alone in drinking water does not cause
skin cancers in animals. it was recently shown that concentrations as
low as 1.25 mg/l sodium arsenite were able to enhance the tumorigenicity of solar uv irradiation in mice (17,18). in this report, we

microscopic analysis of cam sections
after incubation at 37°c with 55% relative humidity for 3 days, the cam
tissue directly beneath each filter disk was resected from each cam sample.
tissues were washed three times with pbs, placed in 35-mm petri dishes
(nalge nunc, rochester, ny) and examined under an sv6 stereomicroscope
(karl zeiss, thornwood, ny) at 50 magnification. digital images of cam
sections exposed to the treatment filters were collected using a 3-ccd color
video camera system (toshiba america, new york, ny) and analyzed with
image-pro software (media cybernetics, silver spring, md). the number of
vessel branch points contained in a circular region equal to the area of each
filter disk was counted. one image was counted in each cam preparation,
and findings from eight cam preparations were analyzed for each treatment
condition. each experiment was carried out three times. the resulting angiogenesis index is the mean ± sd of new branch points in each treatment
condition.

in agreement with our results, the pro-angiogenic effects of arsenic
trioxide were recently demonstrated in mouse matrigel implants. low
and high doses of  xxxd226xxx  were synergistic with b-fgf in
increasing vessel density in the matrigel assay (5). furthermore, the
effects of  xxxd226xxx  on tumor growth implanted in nude mice
after biweekly injections of 0.5–5.0 mg/kg  xxxd226xxx  were determined. in that study, significant tumor growth and lung metastasis
were seen in all animals, with the largest tumors occurring in animals
treated with lower doses of  xxxd226xxx . these studies support the
hypothesis and indicate that induction of angiogenesis, enhanced tumor growth and metastasis are potential dose-dependent toxic side effects of arsenic therapies (5). in contrast, the anti-angiogenic properties
of tetraarsenic oxide, another trivalent arsenic compound, was shown in
vitro and in vivo (19). it inhibited the proliferation, migration into the
denuded area and invasion through a layer of matrigel of b-fgf-stimulated bovine capillary endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner
(19). further data supported the chemopreventive effect of selenium
and argue against the involvement of selenoproteins (19) but rather for
a key role for methylated forms of selenium metabolites (19,20).
in our current study, selenones, selenite or se-methyl selenocysteine demonstrated potent anti-angiogenesis efficacy in inhibiting the
pro-angiogenesis effect of either arsenite or b-fgf, with greater efficacy with dimethyl selenone and sodium arsenite as compared with
diphenyl selenone and se-methyl selenocysteine at the same molar
doses. previous work has suggested that anti-angiogenic activity may
be a novel mechanism contributing to the cancer chemopreventive
activity of selenium (21,22). data support a potential anti-angiogenic effect of selenium-derived compounds in the chemoprevention of
cancer, as do data that contrast two pools of selenium metabolites,
namely, methaneselenol versus hydrogen selenide, which differentially affect proteins and cellular processes crucial to tumor angiogenesis regulation (6,21–23). in our studies, the metabolic fate of the
selenium from each compound is not known. based on these studies
and our current study, the use of selenium-derived compounds along
with  xxxd226xxx  might lead to improved efficacy and safety of the
use of arsenic alone. the exact metabolic fate of selenium derived
from these various selenium-containing compounds is unknown. further studies are needed to document such combination in various
preclinical and clinical settings.
other studies showed that the c- xxxg1370xxx  (jnk)
(and possibly p38) are involved with high-dose arsenite, and erk

is involved at lower doses (24). in this report, the molecular
mechanism by which mapk pathways might differentially contribute to cell growth regulation and cell death in response to different
dosages of arsenite was determined. a low level of arsenite stimulated erk signaling pathway and enhanced cell proliferation, and
this arsenite-induced erk activity was blocked by mapk inhibitor,
pd 98059. in contrast, a high level of arsenite stimulated the jnk
signaling pathway and induced cell apoptosis; this arsenite-induced
jnk activity was blocked by  xxxd3231xxx ,  xxxd3231xxx . the implications of these findings are that a high concentration of arsenic
exposure causes apoptosis, whereas a low concentration of arsenic
exposure is carcinogenic and may result in aberrant cell accumulation (24). this carcinogenic effect of low-level arsenic might be
accelerated by its pro-angiogenesis effects at low levels. another
report shows that arsenite induces erk, but not jnk, which is required for its effects on cell transformation (25). taking all these
data together, it appears that the cellular effects of low-level arsenic
is mediated via erk, as shown in our and other reports in various
cell lines (24–26).
accumulated evidence from prospective studies, intervention trials and studies on animal models of cancer has suggested a strong
inverse correlation between selenium intake and cancer incidence.
several putative mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the
chemopreventive activities of selenium: of these, the inhibition

of cellular proliferation and the induction of apoptosis are particularly attractive. the mapk pathways are known to be important
regulators of cell death, and signal transduction studies suggest
that selenium induces several changes in the mapk signaling pathways (27).
interactions between arsenic and selenium at the metabolic level
are multifaceted and complex. these interactions are of practical
significance because populations in various parts of the world are
simultaneously exposed to inorganic arsenic in drinking water and
selenium mainly in the diet at varying levels. overall, this study
suggests that dietary selenium status alters arsenic metabolism and
disposition (28,29). the several selenium-containing compounds
showed differing degrees of effectiveness in reversing arsenic-mediated
angiogenesis at equimolar doses, but the exact mechanism in term of
metabolic or molecular interactions requires further investigations.
this current study demonstrated a similar pro-angiogenesis mechanism for as(iii) and b-fgf that is mediated via the activation of
mapk ( xxxg1369xxx /2) (as evident by the blockade with mapk inhibitor)
as well as via the avb3 integrin (as evident by the blockade with
specific avb3 antagonist). both pro-angiogenic effects of as(iii)
and b-fgf are blocked by selenium-derived compounds. additionally, this investigation showed that selenium supplementation provided a potential solution to the risk of environmental exposure to
low-level as(iii).
