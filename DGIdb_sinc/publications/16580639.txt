abstract
the pharmacological actions of morphine and morphine-like drugs, such as heroin, mediate primarily through the l-opioid receptor
(mor). it has been proposed that the functional diversity of mor may be related to alternative splicing of the mor gene. although a
number of mor mrna splice variants have been reported, their biological function has been controversial. in this study, two novel
splice variants of the human mor gene were discovered. splice variants 1 and 2 (here called the sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx ) retain diﬀerent portions
of intron i. in vitro translation of sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  produced proteins with the predicted molecular weights. the splice variant proteins were
identical to the wild-type  xxxg1635xxx  up to the ﬁrst transmembrane domains, but were diﬀerent after the ﬁrst intracellular loop domains.
sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  of hmor were present in human neuroblastoma nmb cells and human whole brain conﬁrmed by rt-pcr. in a receptor
binding assay, cells expressing the sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  do not exhibit binding to [3h] xxxd1913xxx . the formations of mor æ sv1 and mor
æ  xxxg2233xxx  heterodimers were demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between mor and
splice variants. co-transfection of mor-gfp and sv-dsred gene showed that mor and sv protein co-localized at the cytoplasmic
membrane. in nmb cells expressing human mor gene, transfection of sv1 or  xxxg2233xxx  reduced binding activity of the endogenous mor.
these data support a potential role of sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  proteins as possible biological modulator of human l-opioid receptor.

morphine has been used as a potent clinical analgesic
for pain killing, but has serious limitations such as tolerance and dependence. the opioid receptors are classiﬁed
into three major types (l, d, and j) that were determined
by numerous pharmacological reports and molecular cloning [1]. all three types of opioid receptors belong to the
superfamily of g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs). previous studies suggested that the l-opioid receptor (mor)
plays important roles in morphine-induced analgesia, tolerance, and dependence as indicated from pharmacological
studies and analysis of mor knockout mice [2,3]. upon
binding with opioids, mor is able to couple to g-proteins
and to regulate adenylyl cyclase, intracellular calcium,

inwardly rectifying potassium channels, map kinase, and
other messengers, which further trigger a cascade of intracellular events [4].
mor is expressed mainly in the central nervous system
(cns), but densities of mor vary in diﬀerent parts of the
brain that may be related to diﬀering roles of mor in speciﬁc brain regions [5]. furthermore, mor is also expressed
in other tissues, such as immune cells [6]. the presence of
mor in immune cells can elucidate the reason why drug
abusers (opioid and heroin) become more susceptible to
external pathogens after weakening the body’s immune system by chronic drug use, especially well described in hivinfected opiate users [7–9].
the l-opioid receptor,  xxxg1635xxx , was the ﬁrst cloned
l-opioid receptor cdna and consisted of 4 exons
[10–12]. alternative splicing variants of mor have been

h.s. choi et al. / biochemical and biophysical research communications 343 (2006) 1132–1140

identiﬁed in human [13,14], rat [15], and mouse tissues [16–
19]. it has been reported that the mouse mor genome is
greater than 250 kb long, contains at least 17 exons, and
undergoes extensive alternative splicing [20]. antisense
mapping studies in both mice [21] and rats [22] supported
the possibility that the various subtypes of mor could
result from alternative splicing of the mor gene.
several splice variants of human mor have been
identiﬁed. mor-1a is an intron-retention variant which
lacks exon 4 [13]. mor-1o and mor-1x contain exons
1, 2, and 3 of the original hmor-1, and exon o or exon
x as the alternative fourth exon, respectively [14]. they
share the same ﬁrst three exons that encode all seven
transmembrane domains. the only diﬀerence among
these variants is in a carboxyl terminal portion of the
receptors. all three variants were detected in human neuroblastoma be (2) c cells and human brain [23]. despite
the report of these mor splicing variants, it remains
largely unknown as to how the generation of variants
is regulated. previous studies have reported that morknockout mice lacking exons 2 and 3 of the mor gene
exhibit a loss of mor-mediated g-protein activation in
the pons/medulla [24]. mor agonists (such as damgo,
endomorphin-1, and endomorphin-2) could not produce
an increasing of gtp binding to the pons/medulla in
mor (exon 2 and 3)-knockout mice, but b-endorphin
could increase gtp binding to the pons/medulla in
mor (exon 2 and 3)-knockout mice, suggesting that
the portion of only exon 1 containing transmembrane
domain 1 (tm1) may have a functional role in opioid
signaling. however, this is largely controversial.
gpcrs have been shown to dimerize/oligomerize.
receptor oligomerization is essential for receptor function,
i.e., for the gabab [25], metabotropic glutamate [26], taste
receptor [27], and rhodopsin [28] as well as opioid receptors, which has been shown to form heterodimers/oligomeric structures in native disk membrane [29]. moreover,
oligomerization has been shown to play an important modulatory role. dimerization of opioid receptors has been
shown to alter opioid ligand properties and aﬀect receptor
traﬃcking both in vitro [30–32] and in vivo [33]. in our
study, two novel human mor splice variants that contain
exon 1 and diﬀerent size of intron 1 were identiﬁed. the
sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  were detected in human neuroblastoma
nmb cells and human brain. furthermore, we report here
that they hetero-dimerized with and modulate the binding
activity of the wild-type mor.

materials for tissue culture were from life technologies (rockville, md).
all other reagents were from sigma (st. louise, mo).
cell culture and transfection. human neuroblastoma nmb cells were
cultured as previously described [34]. hek-293 cells were cultured in
minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 u/ml penicillin, and 10 lg/ml streptomycin. for transfection, cells
were plated in 6-well dishes at a concentration of 1 · 106 cells/well and
cultured overnight before transfection. various plasmids at equimolar
concentrations were used with eﬀectene transfection reagent (qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s manual [35].
reverse transcription-pcr of human mor and splice variants (sv1
and  xxxg2233xxx ). total rna isolated from human neuroblastoma nmb cells
according to the supplier’s protocol (tri reagent, molecular research
center) and human brain total rna (ambion) were analyzed by reverse
transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) using primers, as follows. primers speciﬁc
to mor mrna were primer p1 (5 0 -gatcatggccctctactcca-3 0 ,
located at position 216 in exon 1) and primer p2 (5 0 -gcatttcggg
gagtacggaa-3 0 , located at position 557 in exon 2 to avoid ampliﬁcation of genomic dna). the pcr cycle conditions for human mor
consisted of 95 c for 60 s, 60 c for 60 s, and 72 c for 60 s followed by a
10-min extension at 72 c (34 cycles) and for splice variants consisted of
95 c for 60 s, 60 c for 60 s, and 72 c for 60 s, followed by a 10-min
extension at 72 c (30 cycles). the pcr products of partial human mor
and splice variants (sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx ) gene were cloned into the pcrii-topo
vector (invitrogen) and sequenced.
identiﬁcation and cloning of human mor, sv1, and  xxxg2233xxx . to obtain a
full-length cdna clone of human mor (hmor), a sense primer p3
covering start codon in exon 1 (5 0 -tcagtaccatggacagcagc-3 0 )
and an antisense primer containing the mor gene termination site
(5 0 -tgttagggcaacggagca-3 0 ) were used in a pcr with the ﬁrststrand cdna reverse-transcribed from total rna of human neuroblastoma nmb cells as the template. to obtain cdna clones of sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx ,
primers speciﬁc to human sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  mrna, the above sense primer
p3 and an antisense primer p4 (5 0 -tatcagtcttcttggtagcat
gtca-3 0 , located at position 146 in intron1) were used. rt-pcrs were
performed using the qiagen onestep rt-pcr kit. the pcr products
of the full-length hmor (1.2 kb), sv1 (400 bp), and  xxxg2233xxx  (450 bp) were
ampliﬁed, cloned into the pcrii-topo vector, and sequenced.
in vitro transcription/translation of human sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx . the cdna
fragments containing the human mor, sv1, and  xxxg2233xxx  in pcrii-topo
were subcloned into the ecori site of pcdna3.1 (invitrogen). the
resulting plasmids, pcdna3.1-hmor, pcdna3.1-sv1, and pcdna3.1sv2, were transcribed and translated in vitro with a tnt-coupled reticulocyte lysate kit (promega). brieﬂy, the plasmids were incubated with t7
rna polymerase containing the above tnt kit and 0.04 mci [35s]methionine at 30 c for 1 h. the translation products were separated on a
14% sds–polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was visualized by
autoradiography.
receptor constructs. the human mor, sv1, and  xxxg2233xxx  coding
sequences without their stop codon were ampliﬁed from the receptor
expression plasmids using sense and antisense primers harboring unique
cloning site (hindiii and sali for mor, sv1, and  xxxg2233xxx ). the pcr fragments were then inserted in-frame into pcmv4 (5) and gfp-n1 to yield
constructs named hmor (pcmv4), sv1 (pcmv5),  xxxg2233xxx  (pcmv5), and
hmor-gfp. renilla luciferase gene of prl-sv40 was inserted in-frame
into hmor (pcmv4), sv1 (pcmv5), and  xxxg2233xxx  (pcmv5) to yield constructs named hmor-rluc, sv1-rluc, and  xxxg2233xxx -rluc. the sequences of
all constructs were conﬁrmed by dna sequencing.
radioligand binding. nmb cells containing endogenous opioid receptor and hek cells containing hmor, sv1, and  xxxg2233xxx  gene were harvested
and resuspended in 25 mm hepes buﬀer (ph 7.6). after the protein
concentrations of the cells were determined by the lowry method,
[3h] xxxd1913xxx  (2 nm) binding in the presence or absence of 1 lm
ctop (selective antagonist for mor) was carried out so as to determine
the speciﬁc binding. prism 3 program (graphpad, san diego, ca) was
used to analyze. all binding experiments were performed in triplicate.
co-immunoprecipitation of flag-tagged hmor and rluc-fusion
receptors. cells in six-well plates were co-transfected with c-terminal

receptors in a ratio of 1:1. forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were
washed with ice-cold phosphate-buﬀered saline (pbs) and lysed with
buﬀer containing 50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.4, 300 mm nacl, 10% glycerol,
1.5 mm cacl2, and 1 mm mgcl2 plus protease inhibitors on ice for
30 min. the lysates were centrifuged at 27,000g for 10 min. the supernatants were incubated with anti-flag antibodies for 2 h at 4 c. then,
30 ll of 50% protein g beads was added, and the mixture was incubated
for another hour at 4 c. the beads were washed three times with lysis
buﬀer and then suspended in dulbecco’s pbs and distributed into 96-well
microplates for luciferase activity assay using renilla luciferase assay
system (promega). rluc without a fused receptor was served as background control.

confocal microscopy. cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 1 lg
gfp and dsred2 fused opioid receptors. twenty-four hours after
transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated into glass-bottomed culture

cultured for another 24 h. fixing cells were observed using a laser scanning
confocal microscope.

50,000 cells per well. deepblue c was added at a ﬁnal concentration
of 5 lm, and the readings at 410 and 515 nm were measured simultaneously using fusion system (perkin-elmer life and analytical sciences). the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (bret) signal
was determined by the ratio of the light emitted by the receptor-gfp
(515 nm) over the light emitted by the receptor-rluc (410 nm). the

exon 2 speciﬁc primers from total rna of human neuroblastoma nmb cells. in addition to the expected fragment (340 bp) corresponding to the wild-type mor1
gene, we observed two new bands, 515 and 562 bp
(fig. 1b). we designated these as splice variant 1
(sv1) and splice variant 2 ( xxxg2233xxx ). in order to isolate
sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  only, we used a splice speciﬁc primer (p4
in fig. 1a), antisense primer speciﬁc to the retained
intron 1 sequence and we isolated sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  transcripts in nmb cells (fig. 1c).
sequencing of the splice variants revealed new 173 bp
(sv1) and 220 bp ( xxxg2233xxx ) insertions between exon 1 and
exon 2 (figs. 2a and b). the new intronic coding sequences for sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  were located between exon 1 and exon
2 (fig. 1a). sequence analysis of sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  indicated
that they encoded a premature stop codon (tga) and typical splicing junctions (gt/ag). the transcripts of sv1
were more abundant than transcripts of  xxxg2233xxx , which suggest
the major splice variant of mor in nmb cells might be
sv1.
expression of human mor, sv1, and  xxxg2233xxx  in human brain
to address whether the two sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  transcripts are
present in human brain, rt-pcrs were performed using
total rna from human brain (purchased from ambion).
when using primers p1 and p2 speciﬁc to exon 1 and exon
2, only  xxxg1635xxx  was detected eﬀectively (fig. 1d). however, by using a speciﬁc primer set (primers p3 and p4) to the
retained intron 1 sequence, both sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  transcripts
were detected in the brain with the similar quantity. therefore, both sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  transcripts were also expressed in
human brain. in nmb cells, sv1 was more expressed than
 xxxg2233xxx  (fig. 1c), suggesting that these human neuroblastoma
cells (nmb) may have a diﬀerent splicing system for mor
gene compared to normal human brain.
in vitro translations of human sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx 
translation of sv1 is predicted to generate total 128
amino acids including extra 32 amino acids from the
new coding intron b (fig. 2a).  xxxg2233xxx  is predicted to generate total 101 amino acids including extra 5 amino acids
from the new coding introns a and b (fig. 2b). to
determine whether the two sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  transcripts
could be translated into proteins, we carried out in vitro
translation of sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx . in vitro translated products

conﬁrmed the correct molecular weight as predicted from
their sequences. the molecular weights of the sv1 and
 xxxg2233xxx  proteins were approximately 14 and 11 kda, respectively (fig. 2c).
heterodimerization of hmor and splice variants (sv1
and  xxxg2233xxx )
to determine whether splice variants (sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx )
dimerize with hmor, we performed the co-immunoprecipitation and bret assay. hetero-oligomerization of
dor-kor and mor-dor had been reported by using
co-immunoprecipitation of epitope tag, whereas the interaction between mor-kor was uncertain [30]. jordan
and devi were unable to show interaction between
mor-kor by co-immunoprecipitation of diﬀerent epitope-tagged mor and kor, but wang and sadee [36]
showed interaction between mor and kor using co-immunoprecipitation of rluc fusion receptors. so to determine whether hmor and splice variants (sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx )
dimerize, we performed the co-immunoprecipitation of
c-terminal flag-tagged hmor and rluc fusion receptors, followed by rluc activity. rluc without a fused receptor served as background control. shown in figs. 3a
and b, rluc-fused hmor, sv1, and  xxxg2233xxx  co-immunoprecipitate with c-terminal flag-tagged hmor in each
combination, whereas no rluc activity was recovered with
the rluc construct alone. the result indicated that the
interactions between hmor and splice variants (sv1 and
 xxxg2233xxx ) did not diﬀer from other receptor interactions, supporting direct physical interaction between hmor and
splice variants. to further conﬁrm hmor-sv1 (and  xxxg2233xxx )
heterodimer formation, we performed bret assay
(fig. 3c), which is based on energy transfer from a bioluminescent donor to a ﬂuorescent protein [36]. in this study,
we used a modiﬁed form of the rluc coelenterazine substrate, called deepblue c, which emits the blue light
between 390 and 400 nm upon activation of renilla luciferase. stimulated at this wavelength, the gfp variant, gfp2
emits green light at 505–508 nm, when in close molecular
proximity to the rluc. the bret signal was measured
as ratio of green light emitted by gfp2 over blue light emitted by rluc. to measure hmor-sv1 ( xxxg2233xxx ) heterodimerization by bret, hmor with gfp2 and sv1 ( xxxg2233xxx ) with
rluc protein were fused at the c-terminal. cells expressing
hmor-sv1 and hmor- xxxg2233xxx  had a 4-fold higher bret
signal than cells expression hmor-gfp and rluc

antagonist ctop for mor. when the splice variants (sv1
and  xxxg2233xxx ) were transfected into hek-293 cells, they had no
binding activity as compared to wild-type hmor transfected cells, indicating that these two variants have no opioid
binding ability by themselves (fig. 4a). interestingly, in
nmb cells expressing endogeneous hmor protein, speciﬁc
surface binding of hmor was reduced by the over-expression of splice variants (sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx ) (fig. 4b). these data
indicate that the splice variant and hmor protein interact
to each other and then co-localized at the cell membrane.
dimerized splice variant and hmor inhibit ligand binding
of human opioid receptor on the surface.
discussion

fig. 4. the splice variants do not display high binding to [3h] xxxd1913xxx  and reduced the binding activity of human opioid receptor. (a)
binding of [3h] xxxd1913xxx  from hek-293 cells expressing hmor
(2 lg) and splice variants (2 lg each, sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx ) separately. all values
of binding assay correspond to means ± sem calculated from at least
three independent experiments. (b) nmb cell, opioid receptor expression
cells were transfected with 2 lg of splice variant (sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx ) cdna.
binding activity of [3h] xxxd1913xxx  to nmb cells was carried out as
described under materials and methods. all values correspond to
means ± sem calculated from at least three independent experiments.

(fig. 3c). taken together, these results demonstrate that
formation of hmor and splice variant (sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx ) heterodimers occurs at hek-293 cells.
membrane co-localization of human mor and splice
variants (sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx )
since the splice variants (sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx ) form heterodimers with hmor inside the cell (figs. 3b and c), we further investigated where the location of these hmor-sv1,
hmor- xxxg2233xxx  heterodimers was localized. hek-293 cells
were co-transfected with gfp-mor and dsred2-sv1
(and  xxxg2233xxx ), the cellular distribution of hmor and splice
variants (sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx ) was examined by confocal laser
microscopy. both splice variants and opioid receptors were
observed on the cell surface (fig. 3d). so they are co-localized at cell membrane.
splice variants modulate the binding activity of human
opioid receptor
the presence of splice variants in vitro and in vivo intrigued us to investigate their biological role to wild-type
mor function. after various diﬀerent approaches, we
ﬁnalized to have a meaningful result with the opioid binding assays as follows (fig. 4). the following binding activity of opioid receptor was monitored by measuring the
[3h] xxxd1913xxx  speciﬁc binding with or without selective

the mouse mor gene has been reported to undergo
extensive splicing at both its 5 0 - and 3 0 -ends. now several
human mor splice variants [hmor-1a, hmor-1b (1–
5), hmor-1o, hmor-1x, and hmor-1y] have been
reported [14,23]. all these human mor variants share
exons 1, 2, and 3 of the original hmor-1. as the process
of splicing is not nearly as precise as one might imagine,
splicing small exons in a sea of large introns is so diﬃcult
that the splicing machinery is error prone [37]. we have
identiﬁed two novel splice variants of the human mor
gene, each retaining diﬀerent portions of intron 1 and a
premature stop codon (figs. 1 and 2). these variants, as
well as wild-type, can be translated into proteins of the predicted molecular weights and also expressed in human neuronal cell and brain.
alternative splicing has been shown to aﬀect more than
one-third of human genes. in eukaryotes, elaborate sets of
mechanisms have evolved to ensure that the multistep process of gene expression is accurately executed. one of these
elaborate mechanisms is mrna surveillance for mrna
quality control [38]. the mrna surveillance facilitates
the detection and destruction of mrna that contains premature stop codons by a process called nonsense-mediated
decay (nmd), presumably to prevent the production of
potentially deleterious proteins [39]. sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx , which
contain premature stop codons, could be candidates for
nmd. if this were the case, transcripts of sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx 
would be rapidly degraded without being accumulated.
however, we have conﬁrmed that the two variants are present not only in nmb cells but also in human brain (fig. 1).
each has the same nucleotide sequence in nmb cells and in
human brain. the mrnas of sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  that are not
degraded by nonsense-mediated decay may produce abnormal mor proteins and may interfere with mor signaling.
therefore, they could have pharmacological meaning.
there has been some controversy regarding the biological
function of mor splice variants. one hypothesis is that
changes in protein conformation rather than alternative
splicing cause the functional diversity of mors [40]. however, experimental data are controversial due in part to their
very low abundance and a general lack of validation from
independent laboratories [20]. the 3 0 terminal splicing of

rat and mouse mors inﬂuences agonist-mediated
internalization and receptor resensitization [41,42].
l-opioid ligands show signiﬁcant binding diﬀerences to different splice variants, and their regional expression patterns
vary considerably [16,43–45]. the diﬀerent splice variants
could be responsible for morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide-mediated analgesia [21,22]. the mor agonist b-endorphin induces g-protein activation in mor (exon 2 and 3)knockout mice, but damgo, endomorphine-1, and endomorphine-2 do not [24]. since the gene structures of sv1 and
 xxxg2233xxx  are very similar to that of mor (exon 2 and 3)-knockout mice, proteins encoded by sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx  might play a
role in g-protein activation through b-endorphin.
we found that splice variant-hmor heterodimer complex was demonstrated by bret assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiment. the exact nature of the opioid
receptor homo- and heterodimerization has not been
deﬁned [46]. two general schemes for the dimerization of
gpcrs have been proposed by reynolds and co-workers
[47]; (1) the 1:1 stoichiometric molecular complexes of the
receptors or contact dimers and (2) the swapping of the
transmembrane domains of the gpcrs. using computational three-dimensional models of the opioid receptors,
filizola and weinstein [48] suggested the most likely interfaces between the opioid receptor homodimers are tm4tm4, tm4- xxxg2318xxx , and  xxxg2318xxx - xxxg2318xxx  for dor, tm1-tm1
for mor, and  xxxg2318xxx - xxxg2318xxx  for j-opioid receptor. we
assumed that hmor and splice variants (sv1 and  xxxg2233xxx )
might dimerize through tm1 of hmor and tm1 of splice
variant and then co-localized at the cell membrane. the
heteromeric receptor interaction likely occurs during or
soon following translation and then transported to the cell
surface [49]. dimerized splice variants inhibit ligand binding of human mor (fig. 4b). these data support a potential role of splice variant protein as possible biological
modulator of hmor ligands.
