abstract: the binding properties of opioid receptors on isolated nerve terminals (neurosecretosomes)from bovine posterior pituitaries were characterized. both [3h] xxxd2070xxx 
and [3h]ethylketocyclazocine ([3h]ekc) showed highaffinity binding with complex binding isotherms, consistent
with the presence of multiple classes of binding sites. [d
alaz,d-leu']enkephalin showed no specific binding and
failed to displace [3h]etorphineat high concentrations, indicating the absence of p, 6, or benzomorphan (kz) sites.
mathematical modelling of the data suggested the presence
of three classes of binding sites. the first was of high affinity
with kd values of 0.9 and 2.0 nm for  xxxd2070xxx  and ekc,
respectively. the second class of sites appeared to bind etor-

phine with a kd of 150 nm, and ekc with extremely low
affinity (unmeasurable binding). the third class of sites was
characterizedby kdvalues of 7 and 2 pkffor  xxxd2070xxx  and
ekc, respectively. these results indicate that the nerve terminals of bovine posterior pituitary contain opioid binding
sites of the k type. futhermore, these binding sites appear
heterogeneous, consisting of at least two and possibly more
subtypes or states. key words: neurosecretosomesopioid receptors (k) -posterior pituitary-dynorphinmathematical modelling- xxxd2070xxx -ethylketocyclazocine. pesce g . et al. characterization of k opioid receptors

the neural lobe of the pituitary, which containsprimarily the oxytocin and vasopressin nerve endings of
the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system, has long
been known to contain also opiate receptors (simantov and snyder, 1977), as well as a variety of endogenous opioid peptides. because the neural lobe is a relatively simple neuronal structure, containing virtually
only nerve endings and dial cells (known as pituicytes), it is generally believed that this system would
be an ideal model for the functional study of opioid
peptide receptors. however, despite its simple anatomy, the neural lobe is quite complex with respect to
the types of opioid peptides that are localized either
in or near it. opioid peptides derived from all three
members of the opioid gene family (i.e., enkephalin,
dynorphin, and  xxxg1801xxx ) could, in principle, act on the neural lobe. nerve terminals containing met- and  xxxg1722xxx  (rossier et al., 1977,
1979, 1 9 8 0 kumar et al., 1979) as well as dynorphin
(goldstein and ghazarosian, 1980; hollt et al., 1980;
nakao et al., 1981;watson et al., 198 1; giraud et al.,

1983) and a-neoendorphin (it0 et al., 198 1; weber et
al., 1982; zamir et al., 1984) are located in the neural
lobe itself. these peptides are localized in separate
nerve terminals, and also are found to coexist in neurosecretory vesicles in the oxytocin and vasopressin
nerve terminals themselves (martin and voigt, 198 1;
whitnall et al., 1983). /3-endorphin, although not localized in the neural lobe (bloom et al., 1977), is
found at high concentration in the nearby intermediate lobe, and could theoretically diffuse into the neural lobe. indeed, some experimental evidence exists to
support this notion (knepel and meyer, 1983).
many studies have indicated that opiates and opioid peptides may modulate the secretion of oxytocin
and vasopressin directly at the neural lobe level
(clarke et al., 1979; lutz-bucher and koch, 1980;
bicknell and leng, 1982; lightman et al., 1982;
knepel and meyer, 1983; carter and lightman, 1984;
bicknell et al., 1985). there is, however, some contention about the ligand selectivity of this modulation

and little is known about the underlying mechanisms.
several authors have suggested that the opioid receptors in the neural lobe are primarily on the pituicytes
and not the nerve terminals (lightman et al., 1983;
van leeuwen et al., 1983; bunn et al., 1985). accordingly, we have conducted a series of experiments on
isolated nerve terminals (neurosecretosomes) from
the bovine neural lobe, to determine whether opiate
binding sites are present on these structures, and to
characterize the types of these receptors. we report
here that neural lobe nerve terminals do contain opiate receptors and these are of the k type. in contrast,
p, 6, and benzomorphan ( k ~ opioid
)
binding sites were
not demonstrable.
materials and methods
preparation of neurosecretosomes
fifteen to twenty bovine posterior pituitaries were obtained at the abbatoir and transported to the laboratory at
room temperature in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmn-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n’-2-ethanesulfonicacid (hepes)-tris
buffer (ph 7.3). the intermediate lobe tissue was carefully
dissected away and the neural lobes were minced into approximately 1-mm cubes with scissors. six minced neural
lobes were transferred into 20 mi of the above medium and
homogenized in a teflon-glasshomogenizer modified as described by bindler et al. (1967). homogenization was carried out using an eberbach motorized unit with three to four
complete strokes. the homogenate was centrifuged in a sorval1 rc-2b high-speed centrifuge at 750 g for 2 min. the
supernatant was carefully aspirated and saved, and the pellet was rehomogenized in 20 ml of sucrose medium (see
above) and recentrifuged at 750 g for 2 min. the supernatants were combined and passed through two layers of
cheesecloth and centrifuged at 5,ooo g for 20 min. the pellet
consisted of the crude neurosecretosome (neurosecretory
nerve endings) fraction. this pellet was resuspended in sucrose medium and made up to 30% in percoll (phannacia)
in 12.5-ml ultraclear tubes and centrifuged at 50,ooo g for
45 min in a l265b ultracentrifuge (beckman). the particulate band at the 1.045-1.055 g/ml density region of the gradient was collected as purified neurosecretosomes. the
preparation was carried out at room temperature since previous studies have shown that the nerve teminals secrete
their contents on cooling without any applied stimulus. we
have shown that neurosecretosomes prepared in this manner are viable and can be stimulated to secrete in a calciumdependent manner. the purity of the preparation was assessed by both biochemical (marker enzyme analysis) and
electron microscopicprocedures. more than 95%of the lactate dehydrogenase activity in the preparation was inaccessible to substrate until triton x- 100 was added, suggesting
that this cytosolic enzyme was enclosed in membranebound particles (russell, in preparation). electron microscopic studies showed that >80% of the profiles were nerve
endings containing dense core secretory vesicles and mitochondria (fig. 1). no pinched off glial elements were observed. all the profiles showed staining with an anti-neurophysin antibody, suggesting that they represent pinched off
neurosecretory nerve endings (data not shown). this preparation of intact neurosecretosomes was used for studies on
opiate agonist binding under isotonic conditions.

electron microscopy
aliquots of the neurosecretosome preparation were
mixed with equal volume of fixative (8%glutaraldehyde,0.2
m sodium cacodylate, 0.4% picnc acid, ph 6.0) and incubated in the cold for 1 h. the preparation was centrifuged
in a beckman microfuge and the supernatent was removed.
fresh fixative was diluted to 50% of the above concentration, and 1 ml was added. after a second centrifugation the
pellet was stained with uranyl acetate and osmium tetroxide. thin sections were cut from the pellet followingembedding in plastic and observed in a jeol electron microscope.
opiate binding assay
binding of 3h-labelled opiate agonists to intact neurosecretosomes was assayed in an isotonic sucrose solution of
the following composition: sucrose, 0.25 m; hepes-tris,
10 mm(ph 7.3); phenyl methylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 pg/ml;
aprotinin, 1000 u/ml; bacitracin, 0.02% (wt/vol). the final
protein concentration was usually 0.3-0.5 mg/ml. incubations were performed in a final volume of 1 ml consisting
of 500 pl of a neurosecretosome preparation, 50 pl of the
radiolabelled ligand, and 450 p1 of the same medium containing the desired concentration of unlabelled ligand. incubations were performed at 37’c for 30 min.
the labelled ligands used were (f)-[3h] xxxd2070xxx  (amersham, arlington heights, il, u.s.a.; sp act 40 ci/mmol) at
a final concentration of 0.4 nm, (f)-[3h]ethylketocyclazocine (ekc, new england nuclear, boston, ma, u.s.a.;
sp act 24 ci/mmol) at a final concentration of 1.2 nm,
and 3h[~alaz,~ xxxg2329xxx ]enkephalin
(dadl; new england
nuclear, sp act 45 ci/mmol) at a final concentration of 1.5
nm. following the incubation, samples were filtered
through whatman gf/b filters mounted on a vacuum manifold. the filters had been washed for 1 h prior to use. neurosecretosomes on the filters were washed three times with
5 ml of ice-cold 50 mmtris-c1, ph 7.4, buffer. filters were
incubated overnight in scintillation vials containing 5 ml
of redi-solve (beckman) and counted in a ls 330 liquid
scintillation spectrometer (beckman). all assays were carried out at least in triplicate samples. protein was assayed
using fluorescamine as described previously by bohlen et al.
(1975).
analysis of binding data
data were analyzed using the allfit and ligand programs to estimate ics0values and logit-log slopes (pseudohill coefficients) as described previously by de lean et al.
(1978) and munson and rodbard (1980). the means of
triplicate measurements were analyzed assuming constant
percentage error in bound ligand concentration. modeling
using the above programs was performed as described earlier by munson and rodbard (1980) and lutz et al. (1984).
selection among models was based on the root-meansquare (rms) error of each fit using the extra sum-ofsquares f test, and on the randomness of residuals around
the fitted curve (munson and rodbard, 1980).

the assay both ligands were specifically bound to neurosecretosomes, and could be displaced by increasing
concentrations of unlabelled ligand (fig. 2). data
from competition curves were analyzed using the
ligand program (munson and rodbard, 1980).
fitting the data with a two-site model gave a significantly better fit (p < 0.02 for  xxxd2070xxx  and p < 0.05
for ekc) when compared with a one-site model, indicating heterogeneity in binding sites. parameters for
this preliminary analysis are shown in table 1.
the data in fig. 2 and table 1 are derived from
three separate experiments using three separate, fresh
preparations of neurosecretosomes. the rms error
corresponds to approximately 8% error in bound ligand concentration for any specified total ligand concentration. considerably smaller variability was
found when each of the individual sets of curves was
analyzed separately. approximately 75% of the specific binding at infinitesimal ligand concentrationwas
attributable to the high-affinity site for both ligands.
we selected [3h]etorphineand [3h]ekcas radiolabelled ligands since they can bind to all three major
classes of opiate receptor (p, 6, k ) , and because they
have been used in this laboratory (g. pesce et al., in
preparation) and others (castanas et al., 1985a,b)to
characterize three subtypes ofthe k receptors. the spe-

cific binding of both these ligands to neurosecretosomes indicated the presence of putative opiate receptors on the membrane. further experiments designed
to delineate the particular receptor type present in
these nerve terminals are described below.
studies of [3h]dadlbinding, and displacement of
13h]etorphineby dadl
the binding of [3h]dadlto neurosecretosomes
was measured in three experiments, and no significant
specific binding of dadl was observed. since dadl
has high affinity for both p and 6 receptors (kumar et
al., 1979; goldstein and ghazarosian, 1980; hollt et
al., 1980) these data indicate the absence of these receptor subtypes. unlabelled dadl, over the concentration range of lo-’ ‘-1 0-4 m, also failed to displace
[3hjetorphine binding to the bovine neurosecretosome preparation (fig. 3). previous studies have
shown that dadl will displace  xxxd2070xxx  from the
benzomorphan (or putative “ k 2”) receptors of bovine
adrenal medulla, with kdin the range of 200-500 nm
(castanas et al., 1985a,b; g. pesce et al., in preparam dadl to distion). the consistent failure of
place  xxxd2070xxx  would suggest not only the absence of
p and 6 sites but also the absence o f “k2” subtype of k
sites on the neurosecretosomemembranes.

three separate experiments on three separate preparations of
neurosecretosomes. binding studies were carried out as described under materials and methods.analysis of the data shows
the best fit with a model involving two classes of sites (munson
and rodbard, 1980);parameters for  xxxd2070xxx  were (ko), = 4.8
nm;(k& = 390 nm.the final concentrationsof  xxxd2070xxx  binding
sites in the incubation mixture were 2.1 x lo-'om and 1 .o x lo-'
m; nonspecific binding was 0.032b/f. for ekc, binding parameters were (k& = 1 .onm; (k& = 600 nm; with concentrationsof
3.0x lo-" m and 6.2x 1 o-'m, respectively; nonspecific binding
= 0.018 b/f. rms error was 8% for  xxxd2070xxx  and 9% for ekc.

the experiments presented thus far indicate that
there are at least two classes of binding sites, high
affinity and low affinity, for both  xxxd2070xxx  and ekc.
it was possible that both  xxxd2070xxx  and ekc bind with
high affinity to the same site and with low affinity to
the second site. alternatively, one binding site might
be selective for  xxxd2070xxx  and the other selective for
ekc. another possibility would be a model involving
three classes of binding sites, two showing high affinity
toward  xxxd2070xxx , one of which also shows high
affinityfor ekc, whereas the third is nonselective between the two ligands and has low affinity for both.
in an attempt to distinguish between the above possible models (and several additional alternatives), we
utilized a complete self- and cross-displacement paradigm, whereby the binding of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  and
[3h]ekc was each displaced with unlabelled  xxxd2070xxx  and ekc. a typical experiment is shown in fig.

lo-''- 10-9 m range, whereas the two compounds
are nearly equipotent above
m. the program
ligand was used to analyze data from a total of 11
such experiments (table 2; fig. 5).
the best model derived from this analysis, shown
diagramatically in fig. 5 , indicated the presence of
three classes of sites. binding site r i showed high
affinity for both  xxxd2070xxx  and ekc, with approximately twofold higher affinity for  xxxd2070xxx . the site
designated r2 was present at nearly 750-fold higher
concentration, with a kd for  xxxd2070xxx  of 150 am,
and essentially no measurable affinity for ekc, with
a kdin excess of
m. the third site, r,, was present at a still higher concentration, but showed extremely low affinities for both  xxxd2070xxx  and ekc (in
the micromolar range). nonspecific binding for  xxxd2070xxx  (n, ) was approximately 0.04, whereas that for
ekc (n2)was approximately 0.02, expressed as a ratio of bound/free. these results suggest that approximately 75% of the specific binding of  xxxd2070xxx  occurred at site r1,
the remaining 25% occurring to site
r2.similarly, approximately 75% of the specific binding of ekc is at site r i,but the remainder of its bind-

discussion
the present binding studies, utilizing [3h] xxxd2070xxx 
and [3h]ekc,on intact, isolated neurosecretosomes
from the bovine posterior pituitary have shown unequivocally that the nerve terminals in the neural lobe
contain high-affinity opioid binding sites. the same
experimental preparation showed no binding of
[3h]dadl.the present data suggest that the opioid
receptors of the neural lobe nerve endings are of the k
variety (see wood, 1982; paterson et al., 1983;
goldstein and james, 1984; castanas et al., 1985a,b
for discussion of opioid receptor types and subtypes).
recent autoradiographic binding studies (herkenham et al., 1985; gerstberger and barden, 1986) and
radioreceptor binding studies (martin and falke,
1985; gerstberger and barden, 1986) in the neural
lobe also indicate a predominance of k binding sites.
the presence of d i k e receptors on nerve terminals
in the posterior pituitary is consistent with the presence of endogenous dynorphin ligands in neural lobe
nerve terminals (goldstein and ghazarosian, 1980;
hollt et al., 1980; ito et al., 1981; nakao et al., 1981;
watson et al., 1981; weber et al., 1982; giraud et al.,
1983; whitnall et al., 1983; zamir et a]., 1984; khachaturian et al., 1985). dynorphin is generally regarded as the natural endogenous ligand of the k opioid receptor (chavkin et al., 1982;corbett et al., 1982;
james et al., 1982; castanas et al., 1985b). the coexistence of dynorphin a (rosier et al. 1977, 1979,
1980; simantov and snyder, 1977; kumar et al.,
1979; goldstein and ghazarosian, 1980; hollt et al.,
1980; nakao et al., 1981) in vasopressin neurosecretory vesicles (whitnall et al., 1983)is suggestive of an
autoregulatory mechanism in the neural lobe system.
our identification of the k type of opioid receptors
on neural lobe nerve terminals is directly pertinent to
several physiological studies that have described the
effects of opiates and opiopeptides on neural lobe secretion of vasopressin and oxytocin. several studies

425

have reported inhibition of vasopressin secretion
(lutz-bucher and koch, 1980; knepel and meyer,
1983; carter and lightman, 1984; zein et al., 1984;
nordmann et al., 1986),whereas others have reported
an exclusive effect on inhibition of oxytocin release
with no effect on vasopressin secretion (clarke et al.,
1979; bicknell and leng, 1982). most of these studies
have been done with little regard to the nature of the
opioid receptor type present in the neural lobe. two
recent studies, however, have used k-selective agonists
and antagonists, and have demonstrated inhibition of
the secretion of vasopressin (carter and lightman,
1984) and oxytocin (bicknell et al., 1985) from rat
neural lobe. our data demonstrating a k type of receptor on neural lobe terminals suggest that k-selective
agonists and antagonists should be utilized in such
physiological experiments on the neural lobe.
the present studies show that k binding sites of bovine posterior pituitary are heterogeneous. the model
shown in fig. 5 is the best way to summarize the available data, but this model is not fully established by the
present data. futher studies are needed to characterize
the two putative sites or states r,and r2, using a wide
variety of opioid peptides, alkaloids, benzomorphans,
and other k-selective ligands. even when a two-site
model is used, it appears that one site has high affinity
for both ekc and  xxxd2070xxx , whereas the other site is
 xxxd2070xxx  selective. this is an invariant feature of the
data, and presents the provocative hypothesisthat two
or more receptor subtypes may be present. this hypothesis deserves further investigation.
