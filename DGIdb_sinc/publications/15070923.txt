( xxxg618xxx ), and  xxxg1040xxx  (hdc) are known autoantigens in endocrine disorders. we report, for the first
time, the prevalence of serum autoantibody reactivity against
 xxxd519xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg523xxx ), an enzyme that
shares 50% amino acid identity with the 65- and 67-kda isoforms of gad ( xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx ), in endocrine autoimmune
disease. three of 83 patients (3.6%) with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (aps1) were anti- xxxg523xxx  positive

65-kda isoform of the  xxxd3047xxx  (plp)dependent enzyme  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg850xxx ),
which is expressed in the insulin-producing ␤-cells of the
pancreas, is a major target of autoantibodies (1). in a subset
of patients with  xxxg1193xxx , antibodies against the larger isoform
 xxxg849xxx , which is encoded by a separate gene (2), can also
be detected (3). gad can be assigned to the group ii plpdependent amino acid decarboxylases, which also include
 xxxg618xxx  ( xxxg618xxx ) and histidine
decarboxylase (hdc) (4). the three-dimensional structure of
pig  xxxg618xxx  has recently become available (5).
autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (aps1), also
known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasisectodermal dystrophy (online mendelian inheritance in
man no. 240300), is caused by defects of the aire gene (for
autoimmune regulator) on chromosome 21 (6, 7). manifestations of this syndrome include chronic mucocutaneous
candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, adrenal failure, alopecia,
vitiligo,  xxxg1193xxx , pernicious anemia, intestinal dysfunction,
and chronic active hepatitis (8). several of these manifestations have been linked to specific autoantibodies against

cross-reacted with  xxxg850xxx , and the anti- xxxg523xxx -positive sera
were also reactive with  xxxg618xxx  and hdc. the low frequency of
anti- xxxg523xxx  reactivity is in striking contrast to the prevalence
of antibodies against  xxxg850xxx ,  xxxg618xxx , and hdc in aps1 patients, suggesting that different mechanisms control the immunological tolerance toward  xxxg523xxx  and the other group ii
decarboxylases. moreover,  xxxg523xxx  may be a useful mold for the
construction of recombinant chimerical antigens in attempts
to map conformational epitopes on other group ii plpdependent amino acid decarboxylases. (j clin endocrinol
metab 89: 1636 –1640, 2004)

intracellular enzymes, including  xxxg850xxx ,  xxxg618xxx , and hdc
(9, 10), and it has been proposed that aps1 could be a useful
model for organ-specific autoimmunity in general.
the rate-limiting enzyme in the taurine biosynthesis,  xxxd519xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg523xxx ) shows 50% amino
acid sequence identity with  xxxg850xxx , making it the plpdependent decarboxylase most closely related to  xxxg850xxx 
apart from  xxxg849xxx  (11, 12). for comparison, the levels of
amino acid identity between  xxxg850xxx  and the other group ii
decarboxylases are shown in fig. 1.  xxxg523xxx  consists of homodimers of approximately 55-kda subunits (11) and is predominantly expressed in the liver and kidney (13). recently,
high levels of  xxxg523xxx  transcripts and enzymatic activity were
found in adipose tissue (14). brain-specific  xxxg523xxx  transcripts,
differing in the 5⬘ untranslated region, have been described
(12), but the level of  xxxg523xxx  expression in the brain is controversial (14). expression has also been detected in other tissues
such as the retina and the lactating mammary gland (15, 16).
although evidence is lacking, it is conceivable that autoimmune reactions might contribute to retinal and renal dysfunction in a subset of  xxxg1193xxx  patients. autoantibodies against
 xxxg523xxx  have been found in a rat model for hepatocellular carcinoma (17), but never, to our knowledge, in humans. in the
study presented here, we investigated the presence of anticsad antibodies in aps1,  xxxg1193xxx , and addison’s disease.

into those with clearly elevated indices and those with normal or slightly
elevated values (25).

preabsorption
serum samples diluted 1:25 in a volume of 50 ␮l were incubated with
1 ␮g of purified recombinant  xxxg850xxx  (diamyd, stockholm, sweden) for
4 h at ⫹4 c, whereafter 30,000 cpm 35s-labeled in vitro-translated  xxxg523xxx ,
 xxxg850xxx , or  xxxg618xxx  was added in a volume of 50 ␮l. samples were
incubated overnight at ⫹4 c, and 100 ␮l of 10% fast flow protein
a-sepharose (amersham biosciences, uppsala, sweden) was then
added. after 1 h of agitation, immune complexes were washed and
analyzed by sds-page followed by phosphorimager analysis.

np_000808,  xxxg523xxx , np_000781, and np_002103, respectively). sequence identity (in percentage) by pairwise clustalw alignments of
the full-length amino acid sequences is indicated. the thickness of
each line is proportional to the degree of sequence identity.

dison’s disease were analyzed (18 –20). as controls, 87 healthy blood
donor sera were analyzed. data on antibody reactivity against  xxxg850xxx ,
 xxxg618xxx , and hdc were available from previous studies (9, 10, 21). serum
samples were collected with the informed consent of the subjects for the
purpose of autoantibody analyses. blood donor samples were rendered
anonymous so that they could not be traced to specific individuals. the
study was approved by the local ethics committee.

the mammalian gene collection cdna clone 18185 (genbank accession no. bc008561) was used as template for coupled in vitro transcription and translation of 35s-labeled antigen. this cdna contains an open reading frame encoding
a putative protein of 493 amino acids with more than 99%
identity (492/493 amino acids) with the recently published
mouse  xxxg523xxx  sequence (13). furthermore, the nucleotide
sequence completely matches the genomic sequence of
mouse chromosome 15 (data not shown). this clearly shows
that the cdna used in subsequent experiments represents
mouse  xxxg523xxx . clustalw alignments showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of mouse  xxxg523xxx  has 52% identity
with human  xxxg850xxx  and 89% identity with human  xxxg523xxx .
in vitro translation of mouse  xxxg523xxx  yielded a major product
of approximately 55 kda as estimated by sds-page analysis
(fig. 2a).
analysis of serum samples from patients with aps1,

sequence analyses
the expressed sequence tag database at the national center for biotechnology information at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov was searched
with the basic local alignment search tool (22), using published amino
acid sequences of  xxxg523xxx  and  xxxg850xxx  to identify full-length  xxxg523xxx 
cdna clones. the mammalian gene collection cdna clone 18185 (genbank accession no. bc008561) was obtained from the uk human genome mapping project resource centre (cambridge, uk). clustalw
alignments (23) were performed at www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw.

in vitro transcription and translation
coupled in vitro transcription and translation of 35s-labeled antigen
was performed using the tnt system (promega, madison, wi). translation products were analyzed by sds-page followed by phosphorimager analysis (molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca). 35s-methionine
incorporation was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by scintillation counting.

radioimmunoprecipitation assay
immunoprecipitation of in vitro-translated  xxxg523xxx  was carried out in
96-well plates, essentially as described previously (24, 25). all serum
samples were analyzed in duplicate. approximately 9000 cpm of radiolabeled  xxxg523xxx  and 2.5 ␮l serum in a final volume of 50 ␮l were used
for each reaction. an anti- xxxg523xxx  reactivity index was calculated for each
serum as follows: (cpm of unknown sample ⫺ cpm of negative control)/
(cpm of positive control ⫺ cpm of negative control) as described (24, 25).
as a positive control, we used the aps1 serum that showed the strongest
reactivity in pilot experiments, and as a negative control serum from a
healthy donor. an anti- xxxg523xxx  reactivity index of 0.1 was set as an
arbitrary upper normal limit, as this value segregated the aps1 cohort

 xxxg1193xxx , and addison’s disease and from healthy blood donors showed that only three of 83 aps1 sera (3.6%), and none
of the other serum samples, had antibody levels clearly above
the background (fig. 2b). two of these patients were only
weakly positive. clinical characteristics of the three anticsad-positive patients are summarized in table 1.
to test whether anti- xxxg523xxx  antibodies cross-react with
 xxxg850xxx , we performed a competition experiment in which
preincubation of serum samples with excess recombinant
human  xxxg850xxx  was followed by immunoprecipitation analysis of 35s-labeled, in vitro-translated  xxxg523xxx  (fig. 3). parallel
immunoprecipitations of 35s-labeled  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg618xxx 
with and without  xxxg850xxx  competition were carried out as
controls. after preabsorption with excess unlabeled  xxxg850xxx ,
the anti- xxxg523xxx  reactivity was decreased in all three anticsad-positive sera, most obviously in the serum with the
strongest anti- xxxg523xxx  reactivity. as expected, preincubation
of patient sera with unlabeled  xxxg850xxx  also efficiently
blocked subsequent immunoprecipitation of 35s-labeled
 xxxg850xxx . anti- xxxg618xxx  reactivity was not affected by preabsorption with  xxxg850xxx .
data on autoantibody reactivity against  xxxg850xxx ,  xxxg618xxx ,
and hdc were available for the aps1 patients, including the
three patients who were positive for anti- xxxg523xxx  antibodies
(9). a comparison of the antibody reactivity patterns for all
83 aps1 sera against these four different enzymes is illustrated in fig. 4.

sköldberg et al. • antibody reactivity against  xxxg523xxx 

in  xxxg1193xxx , as 84  xxxg1193xxx  serum samples tested were negative.
anti- xxxg523xxx  antibodies do not appear to be associated with
any of the known autoimmune manifestations of aps1, and
mucocutaneous candidiasis was the only manifestation
present in all three patients. a preabsorption experiment
with recombinant human  xxxg850xxx  indicated that at least part
of the anti- xxxg523xxx  reactivity may be attributed to the presence
of cross-reactive anti- xxxg850xxx  antibodies. the finding that
anti- xxxg523xxx  antibody reactivity was found in aps1 patient
sera only, and the observed cross-reactivity with  xxxg850xxx ,
may reflect the propensity of aps1 patients to develop antigad antibodies directed against different epitopes than
 xxxg1193xxx  patients do (26).
it is notable that all three anti- xxxg523xxx -positive patient sera
also reacted with all the other three plp-dependent decarboxylases  xxxg850xxx ,  xxxg618xxx , and hdc. the comparison of
antibody reactivity against the different group ii plpdependent amino acid decarboxylases in the 83 aps1
patients also showed that none of the patients who were
anti- xxxg850xxx /anti-hdc double-positive were anti- xxxg618xxx 
negative. the limited number of samples makes a statistical
interpretation difficult, but it may be speculated that this
latter finding is related to coexpression of  xxxg618xxx  with
 xxxg850xxx  and hdc in different endocrine cell types.

discussion

using a candidate approach, we have identified  xxxg523xxx  as
a minor target of autoantibodies in aps1. to our knowledge,
this is the first report of anti- xxxg523xxx  antibody reactivity in
humans. despite its close structural relation to  xxxg850xxx ,
 xxxg523xxx  does not seem to have any relevance as an autoantigen

sköldberg et al. • antibody reactivity against  xxxg523xxx 

it is an intriguing fact that autoantigens in organ-specific
autoimmune disorders often are intracellular enzymes, and
it has been speculated that this may be related to unique
immunogenic properties (27, 28). the observed low prevalence of anti- xxxg523xxx  antibodies is in striking contrast to the
prevalence rates of antibodies against  xxxg850xxx ,  xxxg618xxx , and
hdc, which in previous studies at our laboratory have been
found in 37, 51, and 37% of aps1 patients, respectively (9, 10).
defects of the aire gene thus only rarely cause a break of
immunological tolerance to  xxxg523xxx , suggesting that the frequent loss of tolerance against the related enzymes  xxxg850xxx ,
 xxxg618xxx , and hdc is in fact not due to structural features but
perhaps rather due to differences in tissue distribution or
other factors influencing antigen presentation and maintenance of immunological tolerance.
autoantibodies directed against intracellular antigens in
autoimmune diseases are generally believed not to be directly pathogenic themselves, but merely to reflect the activation of autoreactive t helper cells, and the destruction of
target cells is supposed to be mediated by cytotoxic t cells.
although much more difficult to perform than studies of
autoantibody responses, progress has been made in recent
years in studies of autoreactive t cells in organ-specific autoimmunity (29, 30). our increasing knowledge of autoantibody specificities in aps1 may form a basis for future
studies of t cell reactivity against the different groups of
structurally related autoantigens in this disorder, to clarify
the relation between b cell and t cell autoreactivity against
defined antigens, and to elucidate the possible existence of
cross-reactive t cell epitopes.
in conclusion,  xxxg523xxx  has been shown in this study to be
a novel but rare target of autoantibodies in aps1. despite the
close structural relation of  xxxg523xxx  with  xxxg850xxx , no reactivity
was detected in  xxxg1193xxx  sera. these findings extend our
knowledge of autoantibody specificities in aps1, and  xxxg523xxx 
may provide a useful neutral partner in construction of recombinant chimerical antigens in attempts to map the conformational epitopes on other group ii plp-dependent
amino acid decarboxylases (31).
