abstract
the n-terminal sequence of  xxxd2317xxx , a widely used peptide antagonist of the bradykinin b2 receptors, is analogous to that of other known
 xxxg163xxx  inhibitors.  xxxd2317xxx  competitively inhibited the hydrolysis of  xxxd2428xxx -p-nitroanilide by recombinant  xxxg163xxx  (ki
9.1 mum). in the rabbit aorta,  xxxd2317xxx  (10–30 mum) potentiated angiotensin iii, but not  xxxg99xxx  (contraction mediated by angiotensin at1
receptors), and lys-des-arg9-bradykinin, but not des-arg9-bradykinin (effects mediated by the bradykinin b1 receptors), consistent with the
known susceptibility of these agonists to  xxxg163xxx . at concentrations possibly reached in vivo (e.g., in kidneys),  xxxd2317xxx  alters
physiological systems different from bradykinin b2 receptors.

1. introduction
 xxxd2317xxx  (hoe 140;  xxxd862xxx [hyp3, thi 5, d-tic7, oic8]bradykinin) is a “second generation” peptide antagonist of the
 xxxg258xxx  with nanomolar affinity (leeb-lundberg
et al., 2005; fortin and marceau, 2006). this compound has
been widely used as a tool to dissect the role of the kallikrein–
kinin system in physiology and pathology, as it has been
exploited in hundreds of research papers and more than 15
clinical studies; further, it is in clinical trial for hereditary
angioedema and ascites associated with liver cirrhosis (rosenk⁎ corresponding author. centre de recherche en rhumatologie et immunologie,

ranz et al., 2005).  xxxd2317xxx  is a sequence-related, high affinity
and peptidase-resistant antagonist of bradykinin with variable
properties from one mammalian species to another. thus, it is
fully surmountable at the human  xxxg258xxx , but
insurmountable and practically irreversible at the rabbit orthologue; it is a partial agonist at the sheep receptor and a full
agonist at the ornithokinin receptor, the chicken protein most
related to the mammalian  xxxg258xxx  (leeblundberg et al., 2005).
we have lately discovered that  xxxd2317xxx  and several other
bradykinin receptor ligands can act as micromolar affinity
inhibitors of crude  xxxg163xxx  ( xxxg163xxx ), a widely distributed ectoenzyme capable of degrading various vasoactive
peptides related or not to bradykinin (gera et al., 2006).
 xxxg163xxx  is an important inactivation pathway for the
optimal agonist of the human and rabbit bradykinin b1 receptor,
lys-des-arg9-bradykinin (des-arg10-kallidin) (pelorosso et al.,

m.-t. bawolak et al. / european journal of pharmacology 551 (2006) 108–111

2005; fortin et al., 2005; gera et al., 2006). in addition, as a
polyvalent member of the “degradome”, it inactivates some
neuropeptides,  xxxg562xxx  (riemann et al., 1999) and
angiotensin iii, a peptide believed to mediate a pressor effect
in the brain and kidneys (reaux et al., 2001; farjah et al., 2004).
thus, estimating the in vivo role of the  xxxg258xxx 
using  xxxd2317xxx , especially its vasodilator and salutary effects in
hypertension, may be misleading because off-target effects may
include the potentiation of a pressor peptide (angiotensin iii)
and of an inflammatory mediator (lys-des-arg9-bradykinin)
capable of increasing the sympathetic activity and peripheral
vascular resistance when protected from peptidases (audet
et al., 1997). numerous nonpeptide antagonists of both bradykinin receptor subtypes have been developed in recent years
(fortin and marceau, 2006). these drugs are more conventional
as far as biotransport is concerned, and perhaps less prone to
off-target actions. lf 16-0687 ( xxxd174xxx ) is an excellent
example of a relatively water soluble competitive antagonist
of both the human and rabbit bradykinin b2 receptors (pruneau
et al., 1999; houle et al., 2000).
the present study aims to verify whether  xxxd2317xxx  can exert
physiological off-target effects due to the potentiation of angiotensin iii and lys-des-arg9-bradykinin in the isolated rabbit aorta;
these effects are mediated respectively by the angiotensin at1 and
bradykinin b1 receptors, but modulated by the expression of
 xxxg163xxx  in smooth muscle layers of this tissue (fortin
et al., 2005; gera et al., 2006). the relevant molecular interaction
of  xxxd2317xxx  has been quantified and characterized using recombinant human  xxxg163xxx  (breslin et al., 2003). a
modern nonpeptide  xxxg258xxx  antagonist, lf 160687 ( xxxd174xxx ), has been compared with  xxxd2317xxx  in these assays
in an attempt to clarify the pharmacological specificity of alternate
probes for the kallikrein–kinin system.

enzyme kinetics and competitive inhibition ki values were evaluated using a computer program (tallarida and murray, 1987).

2.3. contractility studies
a local animal care committee approved the procedures
based on rabbits. rabbit aortic rings with intact endothelium
were suspended under a tension of 2 g in 5 ml tissue baths
containing oxygenated (95% o2: 5% co2) and warmed (37 °c)
krebs solution (fortin et al., 2005; gera et al., 2006). the
procedures described in our recent report (gera et al., 2006)
were precisely applied to measure the potency of  xxxg99xxx 
and iii in the presence or absence of a putative aminopeptidase
n inhibitor ( xxxd2317xxx , applied 30 min before). other tissues
were stimulated with the bradykinin b1 receptor agonists lysdes-arg9-bradykinin or des-arg9-bradykinin, ligands of high
and low affinity, respectively, in the presence or absence of
 xxxd2317xxx  or lf 16-0687 (applied 30 min before). the concentration–response curves for the contraction induced by the
bradykinin b1 receptor agonists were constructed 5.5 h from
tissue mounting (fortin et al., 2005).

competitive inhibitor of the reaction (double-reciprocal plot,
fig. 1b; calculated competitive ki 9.1 mum). lf 16-0687
(25 mum) exerted a minimal effect on the reaction (extrapolated
competitive ki 203 mum, 102 mum under the hypothesis of
noncompetitive inhibition; fig. 1).
3.2. organ bath pharmacology
kinins contract the rabbit aorta exclusively via their b1
receptors (regoli and barabé, 1980). thus,  xxxd2317xxx , a highly
selective antagonist of the bradykinin b2 receptors (leeblundberg et al., 2005), should not interact with the actions of
the high affinity agonist of this receptor subtype, lys-des-arg9bradykinin, at the receptor level. we observed that  xxxd2317xxx , itself
devoid of any contractile effect, potentiated lys-des-arg9bradykinin-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent
manner (1–10 mum; fig. 2a), reproducing the effect of the
 xxxg163xxx  inhibitor amastatin in this system (fortin et al.,
2005). thus, a 2.5-fold shift to the left of the concentration–effect
curve to the bradykinin b1 receptor agonist was recorded in the
presence of  xxxd2317xxx  (10 mum; p b 0.05, mann–whitney test on
individual ec50 values relative to control values). the nonpeptide
 xxxg258xxx  antagonist lf 16-0687 (10 mum) had no
effect on the potency of lys-des-arg9-bradykinin (fig. 2a). desarg9-bradykinin is an agonist of lower affinity at the rabbit
bradykinin b1 receptor; its concentration–effect relationship was
not influenced by  xxxd2317xxx  (10 mum; fig. 2b), consistent with the
fact that it is not a significant substrate for  xxxg163xxx 
(fortin et al., 2005).
amastatin is known to potentiate the contraction caused by
angiotensin iii but not  xxxg99xxx , in the rabbit aorta (gera
et al., 2006).  xxxd2317xxx  (10–30 mum) behaved precisely in that

manner (fig. 2c, d), with a ∼4-fold potentiation of angiotensin
iii at 30 mum of  xxxd2317xxx  (p b 0.05 relative to controls).
4. discussion
while studying the effects of novel peptide antagonists of the
bradykinin b1 receptor using the rabbit aorta contractility and
other assays, some novel analogues were unexpectedly found to
inhibit  xxxg163xxx  (gera et al., 2006). this led to the
formal characterization of one of the novel peptides, b-10356
( xxxd862xxx -lys-[hyp3, cpg5, d-tic7, cpg8]des-arg9-bradykinin), as a stable  xxxg163xxx  inhibitor (not consumed by
its interaction with the peptidase) with a ki of 0.9–2.2 mum,
depending on the species (gera et al., 2006). it was then noted
that  xxxd2317xxx , with the related n-terminal sequence  xxxd862xxx -arg,
could share this properties vis-à-vis  xxxg163xxx . the
present report evidences that the affinity of  xxxd2317xxx  for human
recombinant  xxxg163xxx  (9.1 mum) is close to that
previously estimated from a crude source of peptidase (6.7 mum,
human smooth muscle cell membranes) (gera et al., 2006).
further, the effect of this peptide  xxxd1891xxx –30 mum qualitatively
reproduced that of amastatin, as it potentiated angiotensin iii,
but not  xxxg99xxx , and lys-des-arg9-bradykinin, but not
des-arg9-bradykinin in the rabbit aorta (fig. 2). these findings
are in agreement with the known susceptibility of these peptides
to  xxxg163xxx  degradation combined with a large loss of
biological activity for each reaction product (angiotensin iv and
des-arg9-bradykinin, respectively), relative to the substrate
vasoactive peptide. the modern nonpeptide  xxxg258xxx  antagonist lf 16-0687 had negligible affinity for  xxxg163xxx  and, accordingly, did not potentiate lys-des-arg9bradykinin-induced contractility.

the contractile agonists; lf 16-0687 was also used against lys-des-arg9-bradykinin. values are the means ± s.e.m. of the number of determinations indicated by n.

the practical importance of the off-target effect of  xxxd2317xxx 
on  xxxg163xxx  is likely to be determined by the drug
concentration reached in vivo and whether it approximates the
relatively high (micromolar) concentrations needed to inhibit
the peptidase. lf 16-0687, in a recent phase i clinical study,
reached a plasma concentration of approximately 600 nm following a 22.5 mg subcutaneous dose (marmarou et al., 2005).
 xxxg163xxx  inhibition is not a concern with this drug,
essentially inactive  xxxd1891xxx –25 mum (figs. 1 and 2). objective
information about the clinical pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2317xxx  is
scarce; a dose of 100 mug/kg infused over 1 h has produced a
mean plasma concentration of approximately 300 nm in human
subjects, along with a surmountable antagonism of exogenous
bradykinin (arterial vasodilation) (cockcroft et al., 1994).
however, higher doses are envisioned in the treatment of
hereditary angioedema (intravenous infusion of 800 mug/kg over
30 min, or 45 mg subcutaneously) (rosenkranz et al., 2005).
high doses are given because the drug is cleared rapidly; such
regimens may produce systemic micromolar concentrations at
least transiently. alternatively, such concentrations may be
reached at sites of administration or in the kidneys, following
tubular water reabsorption. indeed,  xxxg163xxx  is present
in the brush border of proximal tubule epithelium and has been
proposed to limit the pressor effect of angiotensin iii at this
level (farjah et al., 2004). caution should also be exercised in
the interpretation of numerous animal studies that involved
 xxxd2317xxx . for instance, duka et al. (2006) recently reported a
raise in blood pressure in rats treated with a peptide bradykinin
b1 receptor antagonist (r-954) combined with  xxxd2317xxx 
(500 mug/kg/day, over 3 weeks). as this raise of blood pressure
was abated by losartan, interference of  xxxd2317xxx  or both antagonist peptides with the pressor effect of angiotensin iii following  xxxg163xxx  blockade cannot be ruled out.
fears of detrimental cardiovascular decompensation may have
been a factor in the lack of development of  xxxg258xxx 
antagonists for specific indications such as inflammatory hyperalgesia and inflammation, based on evidence largely obtained with
 xxxd2317xxx  in various animal models (marceau and regoli, 2004).
however, the phase i study of lf 16-0687 failed to evidence any
effect of the drug on vital signs, including blood pressure, for a
drug that is only very slowly eliminated (marmarou et al., 2005).
the off-target action of  xxxd2317xxx  on  xxxg163xxx  at micromolar concentrations that can possibly be reached in vivo (e.g.,
in kidneys) has the potential to alter several physiological systems.
the activity of other peptidases may be altered as well by the
peptide (there are at least 40 aminopeptidases coded in the human
genome). a rigorous nonpeptide medicinal chemistry approach
may be superior for assessing the therapeutic potential of bradykinin receptor antagonism and the physiological role of
bradykinin b2 receptors, as illustrated with lf 16-0687.
