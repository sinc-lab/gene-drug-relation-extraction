 xxxd1714xxx  stimulates neurotrophic support in streptozotocindiabetic rats

background: the diabetic neuropathies are characterized by axonal degeneration of peripheral
nerves. the commonest variant of this condition is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy, in which
the principal presenting features can be explained by impaired neurotrophic support of sensory
neurones.
aims: the aims of these experiments were to determine whether de®cits in  xxxg1564xxx 
(ngf) content and the products of its target genes ( xxxg2240xxx  and calcitonin-gene related
peptide; cgrp) in the sciatic nerve of  xxxd3249xxx -induced rats could be prevented using
 xxxd1714xxx , which has been demonstrated to induce ngf synthesis in vitro.
results: diabetes of 8 weeks duration produced a reduction in measurable sciatic nerve ngf-like
immunoreactivity (ngf-li) content of 53% (p < 0.01). this was accompanied by depletion of
 xxxg2240xxx  (of 43%; p < 0.01) and cgrp (of 45%; p < 0.01). treatment with  xxxd1714xxx  (30 mg/kg,
100 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg; daily subcutaneous injection) signi®cantly increased the ngf-li and
neuropeptide content of the sciatic nerve, with 30 mg/kg of  xxxd1714xxx  normalising the levels in
diabetic animals. the alterations in steady state sciatic nerve ngf-li were proportionally related
to the amount of ngf-li delivered to the primary afferent neurones via retrograde transport. thus,
there was a signi®cant reduction in accumulation of ngf-li distal to a 12-h ligature in diabetic
untreated rats (p < 0.01), which was normalized by  xxxd1714xxx  (30 mg/kg; p < 0.05). treatment of
control or diabetic rats with  xxxd1714xxx  did not affect the local production of ngf-li in the sciatic
nerve adjacent to and triggered by an occluding ligature. the change in ngf-li content of neuronal
tissue in the  xxxd1714xxx  treated rats was a re¯ection of the capture of ngf derived from the
peripheral targets of the sciatic nerve. the soleus and edl muscles showed reductions in ngf-li
in untreated diabetic animals.  xxxd1714xxx  signi®cantly (p < 0.05) increased ngf-li in the soleus
muscle.
conclusion:  xxxd1714xxx  could be a useful tool in alleviating the de®cits in  xxxg259xxx  support
in diabetes.

 xxxd1714xxx  and sciatic nerve ngf

fig. 1 the left sciatic nerve was ligated tightly at two points,
1 cm apart, and the ligatures left in place for 12 h, before 0.5-cm
segments were removed distal to each ligature. ligation of the
nerve interrupts axonal transport of components of axoplasm,
but it also promotes synthesis of ngf by non-neuronal cells in
the nerve trunk. thus, ngf in the segment distal to ligature 2
was an amalgam of retrogradely transported and locally
synthesized material. ngf distal to ligature 1 re¯ected mainly
local synthesis and was therefore subtracted from that distal to
ligature 2 to obtain an estimate of axonally transported ngf.
ngf-like immunoreactivity in the samples were measured by
elisa.

produce many of the morphological changes which
are characteristic of the human condition [3,4] and, in
spite of their reduced longevity, form a useful model.
studies on neurotrophic support in diabetic rats have
so far concentrated on  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf).
thus, in  xxxd3249xxx -diabetic rats, there is reduced
capture and retrograde axonal transport of exogenous
iodinated-ngf in the sciatic and mesenteric nerves
[5,6]. in diabetic rats, endogenous ngf mrna [7] and
protein [8] levels are abnormally low in several
tissues and retrograde transport of endogenous ngf
is reduced [9]. administration of either murine [10]
or human recombinant [9] ngf to diabetic rats
prevents or corrects de®cits in neuropeptide expression and may also adjust defective sensory perception
[11]. ngf, produced in peripheral target tissues of the
lower limb±skin and skeletal muscle±binds to a high
af®nity  xxxg2198xxx  receptor, trka, on nerve
terminals and, after internalisation, is retrogradely
transported to the cell body where, by activation of
second messenger signals and changes in transcription factor expression, it in¯uences the phenotype
expression of mature neurones (see [12,13] for recent
reviews). thus, a constant supply of ngf from the
periphery is required to maintain normal phenotype
in those adult primary sensory neurones which
express trka [14].
it is now established that the genes coding for
 xxxg2240xxx  (as  xxxg2240xxx  a) and calcitonin
gene-related peptide (cgrp) are targets for ngf in

primary afferent neurones [14,15] and the reduced
expression of both these genes in diabetic rats is
secondary to reduced delivery of ngf to the relevant
nerve cell bodies [9,10]. both peptides are also
de®cient in sural nerves of diabetic patients with
peripheral neuropathy [16] and reduced ngf has
been reported in skin from neuropathic diabetic
patients [17]. thus, replacement of de®cient neurotrophic support is a signi®cant therapeutic avenue in
the management of diabetic neuropathy. however,
clinical trials with recombinant ngf have raised
problems due to resultant pain and irritation [1,18],
possibly as a result of local over-stimulation of
expression of neuropeptides, and it may be that
disseminated delivery, as inevitably results from
systemic administration, will load neurones with
ngf in such an unphysiological manner as to make
this approach dif®cult. an alternative strategy is to
use drugs which stimulate the expression of endogenous ngf. this could still result in expression of
excessive amounts of ngf, but the drug dosage could
then be lowered and, most importantly, the boosted
ngf production would occur at physiologically
appropriate sites.
 xxxd1714xxx , a b2-adrenoceptor agonist, has been
demonstrated to induce ngf synthesis both in vitro
and in the central nervous system [19]. the study
reported here was designed to investigate the capacity of
 xxxd1714xxx  to counteract the de®cits in expression of
ngf and the neuropeptides under its in¯uence± xxxg2240xxx  and cgrp±in control and streptozotocindiabetic rats.

materials and methods
animals and diabetes induction
male wistar rats (initial weight 300±320 g) were
divided into eight groups of animals at random and
fasted overnight. three groups of animals were made
diabetic with a single intraperitoneal injection of
 xxxd3249xxx  (55 mg/kg; sigma), dissolved in physiological saline. diabetes was veri®ed 3 days later with
a tail vein blood glucose measurement (re¯ xxxd1719xxx  ii
bcl boehringer mannheim, uk). all diabetic animals
had a blood glucose concentration of greater than
15 mmol/l. diabetic and control animals were agematched and were maintained for 8 weeks. one
control and one diabetic group of animals were
untreated, whilst the others were treated once daily
with  xxxd1714xxx  by subcutaneous injection. three
doses of  xxxd1714xxx  were used in different groups ±

ligation of the sciatic nerve and tissue collection
under recovery halothane anaesthesia (5% in o2 for
induction, 2% for maintenance) the left sciatic nerve was
ligated at two points, 1 cm apart for the study of retrograde
transport of ngf (see ®gure 1 for protocol design). the rats
were killed 12 h after ligation, and blood taken for plasma
glucose determination (god-perid kit, boehringer
mannheim). a 0.5-cm segment of the left sciatic nerve
distal to ligature 1 and a 0.5-cm segment distal to ligature 2
(®gure 1), were excised for analysis of ngf content by
elisa. the right (i.e. contralateral to the ligature)
hindlimb muscles, soleus and extensor digitorum longus
(edl) were dissected out and weighed. both soleus muscle
and edl muscle samples were assayed for ngf by elisa.
the right sciatic nerve was excised and adjacent segments
used for peptide analysis and for determination of ngf
content. all animal procedures were approved by the uk
home of®ce.

statistical analysis

nerve and muscle samples were homogenized in a
solution containing 50 mm tris hcl, 0.2 m nacl, 1%
bsa, 0.05% sodium azide, 0.1% triton x-100, 1 mm
phenylmethylsulphonyl ¯uoride (pmsf), 40 u/ml aprotinin and 4 mm edta. samples were then centrifuged at
100 000 g for 20 min and the resulting supernatant was
collected and freeze dried overnight. the assay was
performed in 96 well nunc immunosorb plates. wells
were coated with solution containing 50 mm na2co3,
50 mm nahco3, 0.1% sodium azide and monoclonal
mouse ngf antibody (boehringer mannheim) [20], at a
concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. after a 2-h incubation period at
37 °c, the wells were washed (as in subsequent washes)
with a solution containing 50 mm tris hcl, 0.2 m nacl,
10 mm cacl2, 0.1% triton x-100 and 0.05% sodium azide
and then incubated with blocking solution (coating
solution plus 0.5% bsa) at 37 °c for 30 min to inhibit
non-speci®c binding. after washing, mouse b-ngf standard (rat ngf is not available) and samples (100 ml of each)
were added, in triplicate for the standards and in duplicate
for the samples, to the plate and incubated overnight at
4 °c. after washing, 100 ml of mouse secondary anti-ngf
antibody, conjugated to the enzyme b-galactosidase
(boehringer mannheim) [20], were added and the plate
incubated for 4 h at 37 °c. colour was developed by the
addition of substrate solution containing 100 mm hepes,
150 mm nacl, 2 mm mgcl2, 0.1% sodium azide, 1% bsa

a 1-cm of portion of sciatic nerve, adjacent to the
segment used for ngf-like immunoreactivity (ngf-li)
(see above), was assayed for  xxxg2240xxx  and calcitonin
gene-related peptide (cgrp), both peptides being measured in the same extract. each nerve sample was boiled
for 10 min in extraction buffer containing 2 m acetic acid,
10 mm hydrochloric acid, 1 m edta and 1 mm dithiothreitol (dtt). the samples were then homogenized
using a polytron (kinematica, luzern) before being
frozen at ± 70 °c until assay (< 14 days later). after
thawing, the sample was divided into two equal parts,
one for the  xxxg2240xxx  assay and the other for the cgrp
assay. the samples were then freeze dried overnight.
the immunoassays for both peptides are described in
full elsewhere [21,22].

results
animal weights and diabetes
diabetes resulted in marked hyperglycaemia and progressive body weight loss in comparison to control animals
(table 1). hyperglycaemia was unaffected by treatment
with any of the doses of  xxxd1714xxx  used, nor did
 xxxd1714xxx  affect plasma glucose concentrations in control animals (table 1). there was no signi®cant change in
body weights when untreated control and untreated
diabetic animals were compared to their treated counterparts, though in diabetic rats, the two lower doses of
 xxxd1714xxx  tended to increase the body weight. in control
rats  xxxd1714xxx  increased the weights of both muscles,
though the effect on edl was more marked (table 2). in
untreated diabetic rats the weight of both muscles was
reduced compared to those of untreated controls.

differing effects in control and diabetic animals. in
control animals, all three doses of  xxxd1714xxx  were
effective at increasing steady state ngf-li in the sciatic
nerve (p < 0.01 vs. untreated control). in diabetic
animals, 30 mg/kg of  xxxd1714xxx  normalized ngf-li in
the sciatic nerve (p < 0.01 vs. untreated diabetic).
however, no signi®cant effect was seen with the two
other doses used in this study.

retrograde transport of ngf in the sciatic nerve
the alterations in steady state sciatic nerve ngf-li were
proportional to the amount of ngf-li delivered to the
primary afferent neurones via retrograde transport.
group data for 12 h accumulation of retrogradely
transported ngf-li are shown in table 3. thus, there
was a signi®cant reduction in distal accumulation of
ngf-li in diabetic treated rats (p < 0.01 vs. untreated
control), which was normalized by treatment with
 xxxd1714xxx  at a dose of 30 mg/kg (p < 0.05 vs. untreated
diabetic) and, in control animals, was increased above
control levels at all dose regimes of  xxxd1714xxx . local
synthesis of ngf, attributed to ngf production by nonneuronal cells in the nerve trunk, was also measured in
the segment distal to the ®rst ligature (see ®gure 1 and
table 3). the levels of local production of ngf were
decreased in untreated diabetic rats when compared to
controls (p < 0.01), treatment with  xxxd1714xxx  was
without effect on the local production of ngf at the
doses tested in both control and diabetic rats.

steady state neuropeptide levels in the sciatic
nerve
data showing steady state levels of the neuropeptides are
shown in table 3. there were clear depletions in the
content of  xxxg2240xxx  and cgrp in the sciatic nerve of
untreated diabetic rats when compared to untreated
controls (p < 0.05). treatment with  xxxd1714xxx  produced
a dose-dependent increase in steady state  xxxg2240xxx  and
cgrp levels in the sciatic nerve of control rats (p < 0.05 vs.
untreated control). whilst the effects observed in sciatic
nerve from diabetic rats were not as dramatic as those seen
in control rats, the lowest dose of  xxxd1714xxx  (30 mg/kg),
normalized the de®cits in  xxxg2240xxx  and cgrp content of
the sciatic nerve (p < 0.01 vs. untreated diabetic). the
medium and high dose were without any signi®cant effect
in diabetic animals. interestingly, the medium dose of
 xxxd1714xxx  had a marked effect on cgrp levels in treated
diabetic rats without a concomitant increase in sp levels at
the dose used. regression analysis demonstrated signi®cant correlation between sp and cgrp content of the
sciatic nerve (r2 = 0.55, p < 0.01; see ®gure 2a) and between
the retrograde transport of ngf in the sciatic nerve and its
sp content (r2 = 0.38, p < 0.01; see ®gure 2b).

the data reported here show marked reductions in
steady state sciatic nerve ngf levels and in the retrograde axonal transport of endogenous ngf-li in rats

were associated with diminished ngf levels in peripheral targets of the sciatic nerve such as the soleus and
edl muscles.  xxxd1714xxx  treatment (30 mg/kg) reversed
the diabetes-induced de®cits in steady state ngf
content of the sciatic nerve and caused a signi®cant
increase in soleus muscle ngf content. these changes
occurred without signi®cant alterations in soleus and
edl muscle wet weights. the increase in steady state
ngf-li in the sciatic nerve was derived from an

increased amount of ngf-li in retrograde axonal
transport. there was no effect on local ngf synthesis,
which is attributable to non-neuronal cells around the
nerve [23,24]. elevation of steady state ngf levels in the
sciatic nerve was accompanied by reversal of de®cits in
 xxxg2240xxx  and cgrp content of the sciatic nerve.
de®cits in  xxxg2240xxx  and cgrp content of the sciatic
nerve in the  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic rat model
have been previously reported [9] and are associated
with neuronal dysfunction [25]. exogenous administration of ngf prevents these de®cits in  xxxg2240xxx  and
cgrp [10,11], together with a de®cient response to
thermal nociception, which is mediated by central
 xxxg2240xxx  release [11]. ngf is an established regulatory factor in the expression of mrna species coding for
the precursor of  xxxg2240xxx  ( xxxg2240xxx  a) and
for cgrp [14]. consequently, it is reasonable to
conclude that reduced expression of the genes encoding
these neuropeptides is secondary to reduced delivery of
ngf to the relevant nerve cell bodies [9,10]. as
exogenous administration of ngf is associated with
alleviation of the neuropeptide de®cit in the sciatic
nerve [11,26],  xxxd1714xxx , by reversing the ngf de®cit
produces a similar effect on the levels of  xxxg2240xxx 
and cgrp in the nerve.
b-adrenoceptor stimulation is one of the putative
mechanisms for increasing endogenous ngf synthesis
[27]. stimulation of b-adrenoceptors, increased cellular
ngf mrna and ngf in the medium of cultured
astroglial cells via a camp-dependent mechanism
[27,28].  xxxd1714xxx  treatment of c6 glioma cells
increased expression of ngf mrna [29], with inhibition by propranolol (a non-selective b-adrenoceptor
antagonist) but not  xxxd2914xxx  (an a-adrenoceptor
antagonist), suggesting b-adrenoceptor involvement.
furthermore, the increased expression of ngf mrna
was abolished by the selective b2-adrenoceptor antagonist ici 118551, emphasising the importance of the b2adrenoceptor in ngf synthesis [29]. in vivo, a single
intraperitoneal injection of  xxxd1714xxx  elicited a 2±3fold increase in ngf and ngf mrna species in the rat
cerebral cortex [19].
in the rat, the anabolic activity of  xxxd1714xxx  on
skeletal muscle is expressed as muscle ®bre hypertrophy
[30]. reports suggest that b-adrenoceptor agonists such
as  xxxd1714xxx  stimulate protein synthesis [30,31] and
inhibit protein degradation [32]. the difference between
these observations may relate to the temporal sequence
of events induced by  xxxd1714xxx , since initial changes
in rat muscle involve altered protein synthesis, while
more chronic treatment leads to a decrease in protein
breakdown [33]. this direct effect on muscle was
ã 1999 blackwell science ltd

s. s. riaz and d.r. tomlinson

thought to be augmented by an indirect mechanism,
possibly mediated by anabolic hormones such as
insulin. however, major anabolic hormones such as
insulin and  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  have now been excluded
from playing a vital role in the onset of clenbuterolinduced muscle hypertrophy [30,34].
in the study reported here, both the soleus and edl
muscles were responsive to  xxxd1714xxx  treatment and
hypertrophy of these muscles occurred at the two
higher doses of  xxxd1714xxx . soleus muscle is composed of mainly slow oxidative ®bres, with some fast
glycolytic ®bres and appears to be less responsive
than the edl, which contains a high proportion of
fast oxidative glycolytic and fast glycolytic ®bres [35].
previous studies have reported a signi®cant decrease
in the proportion of fast oxidative glycolytic ®bres
and a corresponding increase in fast glycolytic ®bres
in response to  xxxd1714xxx  [35]. therefore, muscle
containing a high proportion of glycolytic ®bres may
be more profoundly affected by  xxxd1714xxx  than one
composed of oxidative ®bres. this could account for
the differing degree of hypertrophy seen in the soleus
and edl muscles in this study. differences in
threshold of action could also re¯ect differences in
b-adrenoceptor density between these two muscles.
however, the b-adrenoceptor density in rat muscle
still remains controversial, although ®bre atrophy in
rats caused by administration of the b2-adrenoceptor
antagonist, butoxamine, suggests that at least part of
the growth of fast ®bres may be in¯uenced by
endogenous stimulation of the b2-adrenoceptor [36].
thus, it is unclear how differences in the metabolic
activity of slow and fast ®bre types in response to b2adrenoceptor stimulation can account for the differential patterns of growth observed here.
diabetes-induced de®cits in ngf mrna in the soleus
muscle have been previously reported [37]. hindlimb
skeletal muscles, such as soleus, gastrocnemius and
edl, innervated by the sciatic nerve, are principal
peripheral target tissues implicated in the synthesis of
ngf [38,39]. it is possible that the muscle wasting
observed here, could reduce the size of the target ®elds
and hence cause reduced supply of ngf to the sciatic
nerve without causing any alterations in ngf transcription in the soleus muscle. treatment with  xxxd1714xxx ,
causing an anabolic effect on the muscle could therefore
increase ngf production simply as a by-product of
increased muscle mass. however, the greatest increase
in ngf in the sciatic nerve of diabetic rats was observed
at the lowest dose (30 mg/kg) of  xxxd1714xxx  and this was
not associated with the most marked increase in muscle
mass.

it is interesting to note that there was no evidence of
stimulation of the local synthesis of ngf (triggered by
the ligature) in sciatic nerve. at the time-points after
ligation used here, this synthesis of ngf is primarily in
schwann cells and is driven by macrophage-derived
interleukin 1b [24]. this cytokine is a much more
powerful stimulator of ngf than  xxxd1714xxx  [40], so
that we suggest that local synthesis at the ligature was
probably stimulated to a level approaching its maximum
in sciatic nerves of untreated rats and was therefore
refractory to  xxxd1714xxx .
this study demonstrates that  xxxd1714xxx  can stimulate endogenous ngf, with correction of expression
de®cits in ngf target genes, in a rat model of peripheral
neuropathy. if the cardiac b-adrenoceptors were protected and effects on glucose metabolism did not disrupt
control of diabetes, this may even have direct therapeutic potential in diabetes mellitus.
