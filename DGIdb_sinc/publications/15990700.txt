cox-2 inhibitors and metabolism of essential  xxxd2154xxx .  selective cox-2 inhibitors increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke that is attributed to their ability to inhibit prostacyclin (pgi2), lipoxins, resolvins, and endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  (eno) but not platelet cox-1 derived thromboxane a2 (txa2). in contrast, aspirin blocks both cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes that, in turn, increases intracellular concentrations of dihomo-gamma- xxxd2490xxx  ( xxxd1886xxx ),  xxxd208xxx  (aa),  xxxd2318xxx  (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and reduced formation of eicosanoids. on the other hand, such an increase is much less with specific cox-2 inhibitors since they do not block the formation of eicosanoids through cox-1 pathway.  xxxd1886xxx , aa and epa form precursors to  xxxd124xxx , pgi2, and pgi3 respectively, which are potent vasodilators and platelet anti-aggregators, and thus aid in the prevention of thrombus formation. epa has anti-arrhythmic action, and epa, dha (docosahexaenoic acid),  xxxd1886xxx , and  xxxd124xxx  have anti-inflammatory actions as well. epa, dha, and aa augment eno formation that has anti-atherosclerotic action. hence, combining efas with cox-2 inhibitors will prevent thrombotic cardiovascular events.
