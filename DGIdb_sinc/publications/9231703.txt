abstract: a  xxxg321xxx  was cloned from guinea
pig brain by using a degenerate reverse transcription—
polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) strategy. when the
cloned guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  was transfected
into cos 1 cells,  xxxd407xxx  stimulated intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation with an ec50 of 0.1 nm,
whereas human calcitonin was >250-fold less potent
(ec50 27.6 nm). related neuropeptides rat acgrp and
rat amylin did not activate the guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  at physiologic concentrations. stimulation of the
transfected guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  by  xxxd407xxx  also resulted in phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis
with an ec50 of 2.5 nm. expression of the  xxxg321xxx  was mapped by a combination of rt-pcr, northern analysis, and expression in xenopus oocytes. the
guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  was most highly expressed
in diencephalon and a single subtype was detected. key

mains characteristic of g protein—coupled receptors.
based on sequence homology, calcitonin receptors belong to the subfamily of receptors for secretin,  xxxg1885xxx / xxxg1885xxx -related peptide,
 xxxg2417xxx , glucagon and glucagonlike peptide 1, and  xxxg891xxx 
(albrandt et al., 1993; zolnierowicz et al., 1994).
alternative splicing of the  xxxg321xxx  premrna can generate multiple subtypes of receptors.
while activation of all calcitonin receptors has been
shown to increase intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  (camp),
certain subtypes can also stimulate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (chabre et al., 1992; kuestner et al.,
1994). in the rat, two isoforms of calcitonin receptors
have been identified that differ by the presence of a
37-amino acid insertion in the second extracellular domain. the larger subtype is predominantly expressed
in brain and displays altered binding affinities for calcitonin than the smaller subtype (albrandt et al., 1993;
sexton et al., 1993; houssami et al., 1994). in a similar
manner, a 16-amino acid insertion in the first intracellular loop of the human and porcine  xxxg321xxx 
generates multiple receptor subtypes in these species
and affects second messenger activation (zolnierowicz
et al., 1994; moore et al., 1995; nussenzveig et al.,
19%). a third  xxxg321xxx  subtype has been
identified in humans, where 47 residues of the amino
terminus are deleted, resulting in reduced ability to
couple with g proteins (albrandt et al., 1995). a
fourth  xxxg321xxx  subtype exists in rabbit

calcitonin is a 32-amino acid carboxyl-amidated
peptide hormone secreted by the parafollicular cells
of the thyroid. release of calcitonin is stimulated by
elevated plasma calcium whereby it mediates a systemic hypocalcemic response by activating receptors
on the skeleton and kidney (warshawsky et al., 1980;
azria, 1989). other calcitonin effects that are centrally
mediated include anorexia, reduction in gastric acid
secretion, and analgesia (azria, 1989). in addition to
bone and kidney, calcitonin receptors have been identified in brain, lung, placenta, spermatozoa, testicular
leydig cells, lymphoid cells, and malignant cells of
lung and breast origin (zaidi et al., 1991; gorn et al.,
1992). calcitonin receptors have recently been cloned
from the human (gorn et al., 1992, 1993; kuestner et
al., 1994; albrandt et al., 1995), pig (lin et al., 1991;
zolnierowicz et al., 1994), mouse (yamin et al., 1993,
1994), rat (albrandt et al., 1993; sexton et al., 1993),
and rabbit (shyu et al., 1996). the deduced amino
acid sequences of these calcitonin receptors contain

where 14 amino acids within the seventh transmembrane domain are deleted, affecting binding affinity,
camp activation, and inositol phosphate (ip) production (shyu et al., 1996). thus, sequence insertions and
deletions can affect the pharmacological and signal
transduction properties of  xxxg321xxx  subtypes.
this report describes the identification, tissue localization, and pharmacological characterization of a
guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  by reverse transcription—
polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), by northern
blotting, and by expression in eukaryotic cells and in
oocytes. in contrast to previously examined species, a
single subtype of  xxxg321xxx  was detected in
the guinea pig.

materials and methods
rt-pcr and  xxxg2389xxx  ( xxxg2389xxx )
cloning
guinea pig tissue was dissected and total rna was isolated from selected organs by the guanidine isothiocyanate
method (sambrook et al., 1989). mrna was purified from
total rna using the polyattract mrna isolation system
(promega). rt reactions were performed on 150 ng of
mrna with an appropriate primer and the enzyme superscript ii reverse transcriptase (gibcobrl). the resulting
single-stranded cdna was used as template for 25 cycles
of pcr using taq dna polymerase (gibcobrl). for pcr
with degenerate primers, the reaction was first cycled three

times using an annealing temperature of 37°cwith a 2-min
ramp to 72°c,then subjected to 25 cycles of pcr (1 mm,
95°c;1 mm, 60°c;1 min. 72°c) using previously described
conditions (gomez-saladin et al., 1994).
degenerate pcr amplimers were cloned using the
cloneamp system (gibcobrl). degenerate primers ctr. 1

their 5‘12 nucleotides. after pcr, the uracils were removed
with  xxxg2389xxx , and the pcr products were annealed into the
plasmid  xxxg80xxx  1 (gibcobrl). annealed plasmids were
electroporated into competent e. cou top 10 cells (invitrogen) and propagated using standard conditions (sambrook et al., 1989). positive colonies were identified by
dna sequencing, and one clone, psport.ctr.7, was used
as a template for generating guinea pig  xxxg321xxx 
probes and designing primers for 5‘ and 3‘ race (rapid
amplification of cdna ends).

northern and southern blotting
northern blots were performed as described (sambrook
et al., 1989). five micrograms of mrna was size-fractionated on a 1.2% agarose/6% formaldehyde gel, transferred to
nytran membrane (schleicher and schuell), and hybridized
with a guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  probe under stringent
conditions. probes were synthesized by performing pcr on
the plasmid psport.ctr.7 with the primers ctr.8 (5‘

primed ß-actin cdna probe.
the radiolabeled  xxxg321xxx  probe was also used
for southern blots and colony hybridizations. pcr products
for southern blotting analysis were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel; dna was denatured, transferred to a nytran membrane, and hybridized as described
for northern blots.

oocyte-cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (cftr) assay
plasmid containing the cftr cdna (pacf23,

provided
by j. riordan, mayo clinic, scottsdale, az, u.s.a.) was

linearized and transcribed in vitro into capped crna using the mmessage mmachine kit (ambion). plasmid
containing the full-length guinea pig  xxxg321xxx 
cdna (gp.dna3.ctr) was also linearized and capped in
vitro transcripts were prepared. twenty nanograms of
gp.dna3.ctr crna or 20 ng of guinea pig tissue mrna
was coinjected with 20 ng of cftr per oocyte. oocytes
were prepared as described (luebke et al., 1996), and injected oocytes were incubated 24—72 h in 0r2 medium
(richter and smith, 1984) at 19°cto allow for protein synthesis. oocytes were voltage clamped at —50 mv and incubated with 10_8 or lo-~m  xxxd407xxx  (5ct), rat
cs-calcitonin gene—related peptide (rrrcgrp), rat amylin
(ramylin), or human  xxxg80xxx  (hadm) (bachem).
antisense experiments using the oocyte—cftr assay
were performed with a guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  primer
sequence ctr.7 (ctr.7as, see fig. lb). two micrograms
of ctr.7as was coinjected with either guinea pig calcitonin
receptor crna or diencephalon mrna plus cftr erna,
and oocytes were assayed 24 or 72 h after injection as described above.

cdna library construction and screening
a edna library was constructed from guinea pig diencephalon mrna using the clontech marathon cdna
amplification kit. rt was primed using a “lock-dock“ ohgo(dt) primer (clontech laboratories) to ensure a

unique 3‘ terminus for the cdna library. first- and secondstrand edna synthesis was performed using standard protocols. t4 dna polymerase then blunted the ends of the resalting double-stranded edna, and marathon pcr adapters
(clontech) were ligated. subsequent 5‘ and 3‘ race
reactions were performed, each using a primer specific to
the guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  sequence (obtained from
the degenerate pcr cloned product, psport.ctr.7) and a
primer to the ligated adapter sequence ap- i (clontech).
the specific primer used for 5‘ race was ctr. 11 (5‘ cat
aga  xxxg889xxx  acc cac gat agc c 3‘), and for 3‘ race
the specific primer was ctr.8 (5‘ atg tgc tgg gac
gat act cca gc 3‘). the expand long template pcr
system (boehringer mannheim), containing a combination
of thermostable taq and pwo dna polymerases, was used

for pcr based on the manufacturer‘s recommendations.
marathon race 5‘ and 3‘ pcr products were ligated into
the ta plasmid pcr ii (invitrogen). plasmids were electroporated into e. coli and screened by colony hybridization
(sambrook et al., 1989). plasmid dna was prepared from
positives‘ (p5 ‘.ctr. 11) and 3‘ (p3 ‘.ctr.2) race clones

and sequenced by using the dsdna cycle sequencing kit
(gibcobrl).
the diencephalon edna library (150 ng/reaction) was

cct tcc aac aaa  xxxg889xxx  ctt 3‘) and ctr.14 (5‘ tcc
tgg tog cag atg taa act ggg 3‘). thermal cycling was performed for 25 cycles (1 mm, 95°c; 1 min.
60°c; 1 mm, 72°c).

reconstruction of the full-length calcitonin
receptor
the overlapping partial cdnas (p5‘.ctr.ll and
p3‘.ctr.2) were used to construct a full-length guinea
pig  xxxg321xxx  edna. pcr was performed
on p5‘.ctr.hl and p3‘.ctr.2 using primer pairs ctr.1 1
+ ap-1, and ctr.8 + ap-1, respectively (see fig. i). the

pcr products were gel purified, annealed, and extended in
a pcr reaction without primers (1 min. 95°c;30 min. 68°c;
for 15 cycles) with expand long template pcr system
polymerases. in these reactions, overlapping regions of the
sense 5‘ amphimer and antisense 3‘ amplimer strand annealed and extended to create the full-length edna product.
an aliquot (10%) of this fusion product was then used as
template for pcr with primers specific to the adapter sequence ap- i, present at each end of the edna. the resulting
full-length edna was cloned into the plasmid psport i
(gp.sport.ctr) and sequenced. for transfection studies,
the full-length  xxxg321xxx  edna was subsequently
cloned into the plasmid pcdna3 (invitrogen) and denoted
gp.dna3.ctr. in this construct, expression of the ealcitonin
receptor edna is under the transcriptional control of the
cmv promoter.

radiolabeled competition assays
cos 1 cells transfected with gp.dna3.ctr were used
to prepare membranes for binding studies. forty-eight-hour
posttransfection cells were collected by scraping into homogenization buffer (15 mm hepes, ph 8.0/5 mm edta/5
mm egta) + protease inhibitors (2 ~ig/ml leupeptin, 16
jig/mi  xxxd302xxx , 2 j.tglml pepstatin a, and 50 jig/ml lima
bean  xxxd207xxx ) and homogenized at high speed in a
brinkmann polytron for 15 s. the homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 g for 10 min at 4°cand the membrane pellet
resuspended in homogenization buffer + protease inhibitors.
this homogenate was centrifuged a second time, and the
pellet resuspended in assay buffer (50 mm hepes, ph 8.0/
5 mm mgc1

2/5 mm edta). five hundred micrograms of
membranes was used in a reaction volume of 300 j.tl made

to 2% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) containing 50 pm 1251
sct (2,000 cilmmol, amersham) plus increasing amounts
(0—l0-~m) of unlabeled sct, human calcitonin (hct),
ramyhin, or racgrp. incubations were performed at room
temperature for 2 h and terminated by the addition of 4 ml
assay buffer and rapid filtration over whatman gfib filters
presoaked in assay buffer + 2% bsa. filters were counted
in a packard cobra ii y-counter. nonspecific binding, -~1%,
was defined as binding in the presence of 1 ‚um sct. specific
binding = (observed binding) — (nonspecific binding). data
were normalized to maximum specific binding and fit to a
single-site model in an iterative, least-squares, nonlinear,
sigmoidal curve (prism, graphpad software).

cell culture, transient transfection, and second
messenger assays (camp and inositol phosphates)
cos i cells were propagated in culture media containing
dulbecco‘s modified eagle‘s medium (dmem) with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 0.6%  xxxd2871xxx , 1% streptomycin so4,
and 3% glutammne, and maintained at 37°c in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% co2 in air. on reaching 80% confluence,
cells seeded in 12-well plates were transfected with i jig
gp.dna3.ctr edna and 6 jil lipofectamlne (oibcobrl) in serum-free media for 5 h, after which the transfection media was replaced with culture media. twenty-four
hours after transfeetion, the media was replaced with serumfree dmem (100 nm selenium, 5 jig/mi insulin, 20 ‚uglml

were incubated first with  xxxd2388xxx  (lbmx)
or l1c1 for 15 min at 37°c,and then for 20 min with varying
concentrations of indicated peptides plus  xxxd2388xxx  or lici,
and assayed respectively for camp production by sequential
column chromatography (wong et al., 1991), or for ip production by anion-exchange chromatography (seuwen et al.,
1988), and data presented as ratios of {([3h]eamp)i
([3h]atp + [3h]eamp)} x 100 or {(3h-ip)/([3h]inositol + 3h-ip) i x 100. data from camp and ip assays
were fit using the program prism (graphpad software).
results

cloning the guinea pig diencephalon calcitonin
receptor
the deduced amino acid sequence of the known
calcitonin receptors was aligned, and conserved regions were used to design degenerate ohigonucleotide
primers (see fig. 2, boxed regions). these degenerate
oligonucleotides, ctr.1 and ctr.5, were used as
primers for rt-pcr. mrna isolated from guinea pig
brain and kidney was used as template for rt primed
with ctr.5. the resulting first-strand cdna was
used for pcr with the primers ctr,1 and ctr.5,
and a pcr product of 987 bp was identified and annealed into the plasmid  xxxg80xxx  1 for sequencing
(ps‘port.ctr.7). ten identical brain and kidney
clones were isolated, with deduced amino acid sequence homology >79% to the known calcitonin receptors. to obtain a full-length guinea pig calcitonin
receptor, the nucleotide sequence from the cloned pcr
amplimer, psport.ctr.7, was used to design specific primers fors‘ (ctr.ll) and 3‘ (ctr.8) race
(fig. tb). a edna library was constructed from
guinea pig diencephalon mrna and served as template
for 5‘ race (primers ctr. il and ap- i) and 3‘
race (primers ctr.8 and ap- 1). the pcr products
from the race reactions were ligated into the plasmid
pcr ii (invitrogen) and identified by colony hybridization. sequencing revealed 5‘ (p5‘.ctr.ll) and 3‘
(p3 ‘.ctr.2) clones with 237 nucleotides of overlapping sequence that together contained the full-length
guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  (fig. ia). an annealing
reaction with p5‘.ctr.ll and p3‘.ctr.2 was performed to reconstruct the full-length receptor, and the

designated gp.sport.ctr (fig. la).
analysis of the full-length guinea pig diencephalon
 xxxg321xxx  (fig. lb) revealed an open reading
frame of 1,434 base pairs. this edna contains 19 bp
of 5‘ untranslated region and 1.8 kb of 3‘ untranslated region. a putative signal peptide is present at the
amino terminus of the receptor protein, with a predicted cleavage site between ser26 and glu27 (von
heijne, 1983; prabhakaran, 1990) (fig. lb). the open
reading frame contains seven hydrophobic domains
predicted to be membrane spanning. before the first
putative transmembrane domain are four potential sites
for n-linked glycosylation (fig. lb). fourteen cysteines are present in the guinea pig  xxxg321xxx 
that are conserved in other calcitonin receptors (fig.

kidney and used as template for rt-pcr. amplimers
were size fractionated on an agarose gel for southern
blotting and hybridized with a radiolabeled guinea pig
 xxxg321xxx  probe. a l-kb pcr band was observed with the greatest intensity in diencephalon, less

observed in the diencephalon, brainstem, and kidney.
however, this pcr product was not related to the calcitonm receptor, as determined by dna sequence analysis
(data not shown). to determine quantitative tissue expression of the guinea pig  xxxg321xxx , a northem
blot using 5 jig of guinea pig poly (a) ± mrna from
the brainstem, cerebellum, cerebrum, diencephalon, kidney, and heart was probed with a radiolabeled guinea

diencephalon, and kidney, in agreement with calcitomn
receptor expression determined by rt-pcr.

from the cerebellum or heart. rna molecular weight markers are

subtypes of the  xxxg321xxx  have been detected
in the human, rat, mouse, pig, and rabbit. these subtypes,
which result from alternative splicing of receptor prei~rna,result in a deletion in the amino-terminal extracellular domain (human), an insertion in the first cytoplasmic loop (human and porcine), an insertion in the
first extracellular loop (mouse and rat), or a deletion in
the seventh transmembrane domain (rabbit) (fig. 4a).
to test for these receptor subtypes, a guinea pig diencephalon edna library was screened by pcr with primers
designed to flank these variable regions. an amino-terminal deletion would be detected with the primers ctr. 16
+ ctr. 10, insertions in the first cytoplasmic loop or first

extracellular loop would be detected with primers ctr.6
+ ctr.12, and deletions in the seventh transmembrane
would be detected with primers ctr.13 + ctr.14. predicted and observed amplimers are listed in fig. 4b, and
as can be seen in fig. 4c, no  xxxg321xxx  subtypes
were detected in the guinea pig.

sues. the cftr was used as a sensor for intracellular
camp in the oocyte (uezono et al., 1993; luebke et
al., 1996) (fig. sa). the cftr is a  xxxg1836xxx 
(pka)-activated chloride channel (bear et al., 1991),
and activation of a g~-coupledreceptor results in increased intracellular camp, activating pka, which in
turn phosphorylates and activates the cftr, resulting
in a ligand-induced cftr cl current. oocytes coinjected with the guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  erna
and cftr erna produced a calcitonin-induced cl
current on incubation with 10_8 m sct (fig. 5b, upper

were incubated with 10_8 m rcrcgrp, ramylin, or
hadm (fig. 5c). calcitonin did not induce any currents in uninjected oocytes, or in oocytes injected with
either receptor erna or cftr erna alone (data not

was blocked by coinjection of antisense oligonucleotide made against the cloned guinea pig calcitonin re-

 xxxg321xxx  erna and cftr erna. twenty-four hours
after injection, oocytes were voltage clamped and incubated with
10_8 m sct, resulting in a calcitonin-induced current (upper
trace), which was blocked by coinjection with an antisense oligonucleotide made to the  xxxg321xxx  edna (lower trace).
for all experiments, inward cl - currents are shown as upward
deflections in the current trace. upward arrow indicates application of ligand; downward arrow indicates washout. c: oocytes
coinjected with guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  erna and cftr
cana were not responsive to 10_8 m racgrp, ramylin, or
hadm.

random antisense oligonucleotides had no effect on the
calcitonin-induced currents (data not shown).
the oocyte-cftr assay was used to determine the
tissue distribution of  xxxg321xxx  expression.
mrna from guinea pig brainstem, cerebellum, cerebrum, diencephalon, heart, or kidney was coinjected
with cftr erna into oocytes, and 72 h after injection
thq oocytes were incubated with l0~m sct. a representative calcitonin-induced current from an oocyte injected with dieneephalon mrna is shown in the top
trace of fig. 6a. the specificity of this current was
demonstrated by coinjecting oocytes with diencephalon mrna, cftr erna, and antisense oligonucleotide ctr.7as. incubation of these oocytes with 10~
m sct produced no observable calcitonin current (fig.
6a, lower trace). the antisense oligonucleotide did
not alter oocyte viability or competence for signal
transduction, as subsequent incubations of these oocytes with l0~ m rcrcgrp resulted in a cgrp-specific current (fig. 6b). dieneephalon mrna produced
the largest calcitonin-induced c1 currents, kidney and
brainstemproduced the next largest currents, cerebrum
produced the smallest currents, and cerebellum and
heart were nonresponsive (fig. 7a), in agreement with
the rt-pcr and northern analysis. when the same
oocytes used in fig. 7a were subsequently incubated

with racgrp, the pattern of cftr activation was
different from that observed for caleitonin. in contrast
to the ealcitonin receptor, corp receptor expression
was present in all tissues examined, with highest levels

in brainstem, dieneephalon, and cerebrum, and lower
levels in heart, cerebellum, and kidney (fig. 7b). in
all cases, the cgrp-evoked currents were greater than
those evoked by caleitonin, and could be measured 48
h after injection vs. 72 h for ealeitonin, implying that
the corp receptor either signaled through a more po-

tent second messenger cascade or was expressed at
higher levels than the ealcitonin receptor.

discussion
the guinea pig caleitonin receptor was isolated on
a 3.5-kb edna with an open reading frame encoding
a protein of 478 amino acids. the predicted mature
receptor protein of 452 amino acids contains seven
putative hydrophobic transmembrane domains characteristic for the family of g protein—coupled receptors.

function of the cloned ealeitonin receptor was demonstrated electrophysiologically by expression in oocytes,
and
by monitoring second
messengercos
production
2si~caleitoninbinding
in transfeeted
cells. and
i when the cloned guinea pig ealeitonin receptor was
coexpressed in oocytes with the cftr, a ealeitonininducible c1 current was observed, which was generated by activation of the ealeitonin receptor and subsequent accumulation of intracellular camp. the oocytecftr assay was also used to map caleitonin receptor
expression in mrna isolated from guinea pig tissue.
diencephalon mrna produced the greatest c1 currents, corresponding to the highest levels of caleitonin
receptor mrna expression. caleitonin did not elicit
any response in oocytes injected with cerebellum or
heart mrna. as a control for mrna integrity, the
same oocytes were tested with racgrp. brainstem,
cerebrum, cerebellum, dieneephalon, heart, and kidney
were all responsive to incubation with cgrp, consistent with the reports of cgrp receptors in these tissues
(poyner, 1992). these eleetrophysiological results
were confirmed by rt-pcr and northern blots, which
also could not detect ealeitonin receptor expression in
cerebellum or heart. the lack of guinea pig cerebellar
caleitonin receptor expression is in contrast to rt-pcr
data from human, rat, and rabbit (albrandt et al., 1993;
sexton et al., 1993; kuestner et al., 1994; shyu et

463

al., 1996). coinjeetion of diencephalon mrna plus
antisense oligonueleotides designed to the cloned  xxxg321xxx  eliminated the caleitonin response in
the oocyte-cftr assay but had no effect on cgrpinduced currents. the specificity of the antisense oligonueleotide in abolishing only the ealcitonin response
in oocytes confirmed that ealeitonin and cgrp do not
interact at each other‘s receptors.
sct was a potent ligand for the guinea pig calcitonin
receptor in second messenger and binding assays. human ealeitonin was second in rank potency among
peptides tested. ramylin was not an effective ligand
for the guinea pig ealeitonin receptor, similar to the
rat and human receptors (kuestner et al., 1994; sexton
et al., 1994), and in contrast to the porcine receptor
where amylin was a high-affinity agonist (sexton et
al., 1994). racgrp demonstrated the least ability to
bind or activate the guinea pig ealeitonin receptor and
was not a physiologie ligand in these experiments.
several subtypes of  xxxg321xxx  have been
defined by the presence of insertions or deletions compared with the initial porcine receptor sequence identified by lin et al. (1991). a number of alternative
splice variations of the ealeitonin receptor have been
described in the cns. differences include a deletion
in the first amino-terminal domain, an insertion in the
first intracellular or extracellular loops, or a deletion
in the seventh transmembrane domain (fig. 4). such
isoforms have been identified in a single organ, and
even within a single cell type in the ease of the porcine
llc-pk~cells (zolnierowicz et al., 1994). northern
blot analysis for the guinea pig ealcitonin receptor
identified a single 4.0-kb transcript. however, northern
analysis may not have sufficient resolution to detect
alternative splice variants containing small changes.
therefore, pcr was used to detect alterations in the
guinea pig  xxxg321xxx  by using primers that
flanked regions of alterations described in other species. no homologous subtypes were detected in the
guinça pig (fig. 4). although we cannot rule out receptor subtypes derived from subtle changes (such as
amino acid substitutions), our data imply that the
guinea pig may have evolved a single  xxxg321xxx  to perform the roles that the various subtypes perform in other species.
