wilms tumor is one of the most frequent neoplasias in
children. our previous microarray screening in a large
series of wilms tumors revealed several candidate genes
that are deregulated in advanced tumors and are part of
the  xxxd3417xxx  signaling pathway. to investigate
whether  xxxd3417xxx  could be employed as a novel
therapeutic agent in these tumors, we treated cultured
wilms tumor cells with different concentrations of alltrans  xxxd3417xxx  (atra) and assessed gene expression
changes by real-time rt–pcr as well as microarray
analysis. several genes like  xxxg1934xxx , rarres3,
 xxxg542xxx , cks2,  xxxg365xxx , igfbp3, ube2c, ccl2 or
itm2b that were previously found to be deregulated in
advanced tumors exhibited opposite expression changes
after atra treatment. in addition to enhanced retinoid
signaling, the transforming growth factor-beta ( xxxg2269xxx )
pathway was strongly activated by atra treatment of
wilms tumor cells. both the  xxxd3417xxx  and the  xxxg2269xxx 
pathway mediate inhibition of cell growth. these ﬁndings
represent the ﬁrst molecular evidence of a potential beneﬁt
from atra treatment in wilms tumors.

wilms tumor or nephroblastoma is a malignant kidney
tumor that affects one in 10 000 children. only a minority
of wilms tumors (10–15%) carries mutations in wt1, the
wilms tumor gene 1, and/or b-catenin ( xxxg545xxx ),
whereas the molecular basis of wilms tumorigenesis
remains unclear in most cases. with the aim of detecting
new candidate genes associated with malignancy grade
and tumor progression, we recently performed cdna
microarray experiments using a large series of 77 primary
wilms tumors (zirn et al., 2005). several differentially

expressed genes, for example, rarres3,  xxxg542xxx  and
 xxxg512xxx , were not only associated with disease progression but are also part of the  xxxd3417xxx  signaling
pathway. we therefore speculated that  xxxd3417xxx 
treatment may represent a novel therapeutic approach
in advanced tumors. expression of these previously
identiﬁed  xxxd3417xxx -regulated genes that are deregulated in advanced wilms tumors should then be reversed
after treatment with  xxxd3417xxx . additionally, we aimed
at the identiﬁcation of novel  xxxd3417xxx -dependent
genes in wilms tumors through expression proﬁling of
treated cells (see supplementary material).
all-trans  xxxd3417xxx  (atra) is a  xxxd3105xxx 
derivative capable of inhibiting cell proliferation and
inducing cell differentiation (ross et al., 2000). these
regulatory effects have been demonstrated in normal
cells as well as in several types of cancer cells. a direct
consequence of these experimental data has been the use
of atra in the induction treatment of acute  xxxg1785xxx  leading to high rates of complete
remission and cure in combination with chemotherapy
(for a review see freemantle et al., 2003). in several
other cancer types, clinical trials with  xxxd3417xxx  are
currently performed, for example, in advanced neuroblastoma (reynolds et al., 2003).
to investigate the response of wilms tumors to
atra, we used two different sources of wilms tumor
cells: (1) mz 128 are derived from a tumor with
predominantly stromal histology, a wt1 mutation, and
a cytogenetically detectable de novo chromosome 7/12
translocation (lobbert et al., 1998); (2) ws 427 are
primary cells from a triphasic tumor without wt1
mutation, where the majority of cells grew in a
cobblestone-like pattern during short-term culture. both
types of cells were initially treated with different
concentrations of atra (100 nm, 10 mm and 1 mm)
for 24 h. gene expression was then assayed by real-time
qpcr for a series of ra-regulated genes, especially ones
that had shown differential regulation in advanced
wilms tumors in our previous microarray study.
altogether 11 genes were studied by qpcr:  xxxg1934xxx ,
rarres3,  xxxg512xxx , igfbp3,  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1933xxx  and
trim22 were upregulated by atra treatment,
whereas enpp2 was downregulated. rarres2, igf2

figure 1 examples of differential gene expression in both types of wilms tumor cells after exposure to various concentrations of
atra (sigma, taufkirchen, germany) for 24 h. after rna extraction with trizol reagent (invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany), cdna
synthesis and real-time pcr were performed as described previously (zirn et al., 2005). qpcr fold changes refer to untreated control
cells (fold change ¼ 1). four genes were induced by atra ( xxxg1934xxx , rarres3,  xxxg512xxx , igfbp3), whereas enpp2/atx
represents an example of a downregulated gene. rarres2 is not differentially regulated in a consistent manner

and rara remained unchanged. the latter three genes
also remained unchanged in advanced wilms tumors.
data for six of these genes are shown in figure 1. it is
important to note that differential gene expression
occurred concordantly in both types of cells. atra
concentrations of 100 nm had little effect, whereas 10 mm
and 1 mm strongly altered gene regulation. compared to
10 mm, application of 1 mm atra did not further
enhance differential gene regulation.
to investigate how cell growth is inﬂuenced by
continuous atra treatment, we additionally exposed
both types of cells to atra for 5 days. the atracontaining medium was changed once in between.
whereas cell growth was almost unchanged at a
concentration of 100 nm atra as compared to
untreated cells, higher concentrations markedly inhibited cell proliferation. cell growth was completely
stopped when a concentration of 1 mm atra was
applied for 5 days (data not shown).
to assess global gene expression changes and to
identify additional  xxxd3417xxx -regulated candidate
genes in wilms tumors, we performed microarray
analysis of both cell lines after 24 h atra treatment.
in these experiments, an atra concentration of 10 mm
was chosen for two reasons: ﬁrstly, it exerted a strong
regulatory effect in qpcr (compare figure 1), and
secondly, previous experiments suggested similar concentrations to be effective in vivo (reynolds et al., 1991).
for quality control, each experiment was performed as
sandwich hybridization, that is, instead of a coverslip, a

second microarray slide was used. the mean log-ratios
m were calculated from replicates. only gene replicates
with optimal reproducibility, that is, difference of less
than 75% of the calculated average log-ratio and signal
intensity that was higher than background intensity
were included in the ﬁnal analysis.
for both types of cells, the 30 candidate genes with
highest fold changes due to atra treatment are listed
in table 1. several of the genes identiﬁed are known
atra targets, for example, igfbp3 and  xxxg542xxx /
 xxxg542xxx  (freemantle et al., 2002), and their regulation
was in accordance with the literature. all overlapping
genes were concordantly regulated, that is, in the same
direction.
we then performed hierarchical clustering of those
genes that (1) were differentially regulated in advanced
tumors and (2) changed their expression in atratreated tumor cells. hierarchical clustering of these
genes revealed a frequent coregulation in individual
tumors from our previous study, despite the heterogeneity of that collection (figure 2). additionally, most
genes exhibited opposite regulation after atra treatment as compared to their overall regulation in high risk
and relapsed wilms tumors. for example, the genes
 xxxg1934xxx  and rarres3 had been frequently downregulated in high-risk and relapsed tumors, whereas
their expression was increased after atra treatment.
this atra-induced inverse expression of genes associated with disease progression is an important ﬁnding
since it represents the ﬁrst molecular evidence of a
oncogene

cdna microarray experiments were performed as sandwich hybridizations and standardized as described previously (zirn et al., 2005). to
compare expression proﬁles, the difference of the mean log 2-ratios between atra-treated cells and control was calculated, respectively, based on
replicated measurements

of wilms tumors (zirn et al., in press). individual tumors are represented by vertical columns. high-risk and relapsed tumors are
denoted by black squares in the middle bar. gene symbols are listed on the right. the table below the red-green cluster lists the overall
fold changes of these genes in high-risk (as opposed to intermediate risk) and relapsed (as opposed to 3-year relapse-free) tumors from
our previous study. on the right side, the mean fold changes in both types of cells after atra treatment are displayed. in both, the
microarray cluster and the table, green squares designate downregulation of a gene and red squares designate upregulation. gray
squares indicate missing or poorly reproducible data between replicated measurements

potential beneﬁt of  xxxd3417xxx  treatment in wilms
tumors.

retinoid signaling
the retinoid signal is transduced by two families of nuclear
receptors, the  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars) (rara,
 xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx ) and the retinoid x receptors ( xxxg1998xxx ,
 xxxg1999xxx  and  xxxg2000xxx ), which cooperate as rar/rxr
heterodimers (kastner et al., 1997). atra exclusively
activates rars, whereas 9-cis ra stimulates both rars
and rxrs. the upregulation of the rars by atra has
been described previously (farias et al., 2002; reynolds
et al., 2003). as a consequence of atra exposure in
wilms tumor cells, we found the rars  xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx 
to be upregulated (table 1), whereas rara remained
unchanged in both types of atra-treated wilms tumor
cells.  xxxg1932xxx  was represented in two different clones on the
array, which were both independently upregulated in
replicated measurements in both cell types.  xxxg1933xxx  was
only upregulated in ws 427.
additionally, the rar responders  xxxg1934xxx  and
rarres3, which represent retinoid-inducible tumor
suppressor genes, were induced by atra treatment.

for both genes, replicated gene expression measurements on the array resulted in strong upregulation in
one cell type, but minor changes or poor reproducibility
in the other (figure 2). we therefore analysed both
genes by real-time rt–pcr and found a strong and
reproducible upregulation of both genes in both cell
types (figure 1).
the expression of  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1933xxx ,  xxxg1934xxx  and
rarres3 strongly inhibits cellular proliferation and
mediates differentiation of normal and cancer tissues.
correspondingly,  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1934xxx  and rarres3
mrna levels were found to be repressed in many
different tumors (freemantle et al., 2003; shyu et al.,
2003; sriuranpong et al., 2004). moreover, downregulation of  xxxg1932xxx  and rarres3 could be associated with
disease progression in neuroblastoma (cheung et al.,
1998) and b-cell lymphocytic leukemia (casanova et al.,
2001), respectively. in our previous microarray analysis
of 77 wilms tumors,  xxxg1934xxx  and rarres3 were
also downregulated in advanced tumors. therefore, we
interpret the inverse expression of  xxxg1934xxx  and
rarres3 following atra treatment as a positive
response to atra. together with  xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx ,
these genes may be involved in differentiation processes
in atra-treated wilms tumor cells. during normal
kidney development,  xxxd3417xxx  is one of the
oncogene

 xxxd3417xxx  treatment of wilms tumor cells

important factors involved in primary pattern formation
and this may in part be recapitulated in these tumor cells
(burrow, 2000).
 xxxg634xxx  (dehydrogenase/reductase sdr family member 3) also known as  xxxg1942xxx  or  xxxg634xxx  (prostate and
retinal short chain dehydrogenase/reductase) was also
found to be strongly upregulated in both cell lines (13.6and 4.6-fold).  xxxg634xxx  is a known  xxxd3417xxx -inducible
gene (cerignoli et al., 2002) that encodes a retinal
reductase (kedishvili et al., 2002). retinol regeneration
by  xxxg634xxx  depends on the presence of the cellular
 xxxd3417xxx  binding protein  xxxg512xxx  (cerignoli et al.,
2002), a gene that was concordantly upregulated in
atra-treated wilms tumor cells. in addition to classical
ra signaling, further pathways appear to be affected by
atra treatment that may mediate effects on growth
control and differentiation as discussed below.
smad/transforming growth factor-beta ( xxxg2269xxx ) signaling
the activation of the  xxxg2269xxx  pathway strongly inhibits
cell cycle progression at the g1 phase with smad
proteins as the principal intracellular transducers. their
capacity to activate  xxxg2269xxx  target genes is enhanced by a
direct interaction with  xxxg1933xxx  (pendaries et al., 2003).
the upregulation of  xxxg2170xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx , which we
found in atra-treated wilms tumor cells, may
contribute to enhanced  xxxg2269xxx  signaling and may thereby
counteract disease progression. this is consistent with
the observation that inactivation of smads was
associated with poor outcome in several cancer types,
for example, breast and colorectal cancer (xie et al.,
2002; xie et al., 2003).
interestingly, the atra-induced igfbp6, igfbp3
and  xxxg542xxx / xxxg542xxx  genes are also thought to exhibit
antiproliferative activities in vivo since upregulation,
especially of the latter two, was inversely associated with
tumor progression in several cancer types (petridou et al.,
2001; xie et al., 2004). these factors were further shown
to mediate directly the antiproliferative and proapoptotic
effects of  xxxg2269xxx  (kansra et al., 2000; koliopanos et al.,
2002). additionally, pdgf (platelet-derived growth
factor) and plasminogen activators have been described
as mediators of  xxxg2269xxx  signaling (battegay et al., 1990;
imai et al., 1997). we found the receptors  xxxg1709xxx  and
 xxxg1768xxx  (plasminogen activator urokinase receptor) to be
upregulated in atra exposed wilms tumor cells. of
note, overexpression of  xxxg1768xxx  has been associated with
longer survival in children with neuroblastoma (li et al.,
2004). taken together, this combination of differentially
expressed genes strongly hints at a connection between
 xxxd3417xxx  and other signaling systems in tumor
progression, of which the smad/ xxxg2269xxx  pathway may
play the most prominent role.

genes involved in cell proliferation and matrix remodeling
several genes differentially expressed as a consequence
of atra exposure in wilms tumors have previously
oncogene

described functions in cell proliferation: these are the
upregulated genes dlc1, akap12/gravin and itm2b,
as well as the downregulated genes cks2 and  xxxg365xxx .
dlc1 and akap12/gravin were reported to be either
deleted or downregulated in human cancer, whereas
restoration of their expression induced apoptosis (yuan
et al., 2003; choi et al., 2004). itm2b is a known
regulator of cell death that promotes apoptosis and
interacts with  xxxg250xxx  (fleischer et al., 2002). therefore,
upregulation of these genes may contribute to growth
inhibition in atra-treated wilms tumor cells.  xxxg365xxx 
and cks2 are well-known cell cycle checkpoint genes
whose overexpression was linked to cell proliferation
and tumor progression (urbanowicz-kachnowicz et al.,
1999; bahnassy et al., 2004). hence, downregulation of
these genes in wilms tumors may convey antiproliferative effects.
the removal or modiﬁcation of cell adhesion is a
prerequisite of both tumor growth or spreading and
tumor angiogenesis. several integrins are involved in
these processes and they not only mediate cellular
adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins but also
transduce intracellular signals that promote the attachment and migration of cells on the surrounding
extracellular matrix (for a review see jin and varner,
2004). we found the expression of itgb1 (ﬁbronectin
receptor) and itga1 to be altered by atra. in
addition, several components of the basement membrane that interact with integrins were differentially
expressed after atra exposure, for example, laminin a4
(gonzalez et al., 2002), nidogen-2 (salmivirta et al.,
2002) and  xxxg542xxx / xxxg542xxx  (chang et al., 2004). therefore, matrix remodeling may also contribute to inhibition of cell growth in wilms tumor cells.

consequences for the potential clinical application of
atra in advanced wilms tumors
the current study has identiﬁed a variety of regulatory
genes that are candidate targets of atra in wilms
tumors. several genes that had previously been associated with wilms tumor progression were inversely
regulated after atra treatment. this provides the ﬁrst
molecular evidence of a potential beneﬁt of  xxxd3417xxx 
treatment in wilms tumors. especially in those tumors
that resist conventional therapy, atra-induced growth
inhibition may provide an alternative or additional
therapeutic approach.
further biological studies are clearly needed to
conﬁrm these positive effects of atra in wilms tumors
before ﬁrst clinical trials with retinoids in advanced
tumors could be envisaged. atra needs to be
compared to other retinoids such as  xxxd2404xxx  and
 xxxd2099xxx  that exhibit partially different pharmacological effects. moreover, the mode of administration
(continuous versus pulse therapy) inﬂuences pharmacokinetic properties and thereby impacts on the effectiveness of retinoid therapy. for example, in high-risk
neuroblastoma, a phase iii trial with high-dose pulse

 xxxd3417xxx  treatment of wilms tumor cells
b zirn et al

5251

therapy signiﬁcantly improved event-free survival (reynolds et al., 2003). pulse therapy may be of advantage
since continuous atra application was shown to
induce its own metabolism, thus reducing peak levels
of the drug (adamson et al., 1997).
our study suggests that an atra concentration of
10 mm effectively inhibits cell growth and induces gene
regulation. drug levels between 1 and 10 mm were also
reported to lead to growth inhibition in other in vitro
studies in cancer cells and were suggested to be
effectively reached in target tissues in vivo (reynolds

et al., 2003). these are only some of the practical issues
that would have to be addressed before retinoids could
be clinically applied in advanced wilms tumors, but our
data suggest that it may be well worth the effort.
