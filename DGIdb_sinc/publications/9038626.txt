range of primary cancers and tumour-derived cell lines [ 11.
recently, we reported the first study of thyroid cancers in
which four of a series of seven showed deletion of the pl6
gene locus [2]. in the light of recent reports pointing to the
occurrence of point mutations [i] and differences in transcriptional regulation [3], we have now looked for more
subtle lesions in the remaining cell lines that appeared to
have a normal ~16 gene in our initial report, namely, ftc
133 (derived from follicular carcinoma), bcpap and npa
(both from papillary cancers). two types of analyses were
performed; sequencing of genomic dna and methylation
status.
in sequencing
the genomic
dna,
the two exons
in which most of the p16 gene (approximately 97%) lies, were
isolated by pcr (polymerase chain reaction) using primers as
follows: exon
1 gaagaaagaggaggggctg
and
exon
2
acacagcgctacctgattccaattc;
tctgagctttggand
agcttcc-ittccgtc
aagctc.
genomic dna (100 ng) was amplified for 40
cycles (94°c 40 s; 60°c 40 s; 72°c 90 s) under standard conditions with the addition of 3.6% formamide. purified pcr
products were subcloned using the ta system (invitrogen).
both strands of three clones from each cell line were analysed
by double-stranded dna cycle sequencing on an abi 373 system using the original pcr primers, abi prism dye terminators and taq fs.
in the npa cell line, a point mutation in the splice donor
consensus site flanking exon 1, was identified (t + c at base
256, genbank u 128 18). this would result in an incorrectly
spliced mrna and inappropriate translation, effectively abolishing pl6 function. this observation was confirmed by direct
sequencing of another pcr product from npa dna. the
other cell lines had wild type pl6 sequence.
reduction of gene expression, caused by de ylo’uo
methylation of cpg islands within exon 1 ofp16, has been identified
in both primary tumours and tumour-derived cell lines [3].
