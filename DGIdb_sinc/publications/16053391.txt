case history
resistance to thyroid hormone in a patient
with thyroid dysgenesis
helmut grasberger,1 usanee ringkananont,1 michael croxson,2 and samuel refetoff1,3,4

we report a patient with the unusual coincidence of two rare congenital disorders, lingual ectopy of the thyroid
gland and resistance to thyroid hormone (rth), resulting in impaired thyroid hormone production and action, respectively. the proposita had a positive  xxxd3368xxx  (tsh) newborn screening test (350 mu/l, confirmed) with
normal  xxxd1863xxx  (t4) and no clinical signs of hypothyroidism. a scintiscan revealed lingual but no orthotopic thyroid tissue. levothyroxine ( xxxd2750xxx ) replacement failed to reduce tsh and was discontinued after four months owing
to significantly elevated free t4. her physical and mental development was unremarkable, and she was considered to be clinically euthyroid throughout childhood, even though she received either no t4 or a dose insufficient
to lessen hyperthyrotropinemia. at the age of 15 years, t4 was gradually increased to a supraphysiological dose
of 300 g/d, resulting in the normalization of the serum tsh level, and subjective improvements in her ability to
concentrate. the proposita’s mother was clinically euthyroid, had a palpable diffuse goiter, and thyroid function
tests consistent with rth. this diagnosis was confirmed by detection of a heterozygous mutation (r320h) in the
thyroid  xxxg1603xxx - (tr-) gene found in both the proposita and her mother. under the high-dose t4 regimen, the patient’s tsh and free t4 values resembled those of untreated patients with tr r320h mutation, suggesting that a compensated state could be achieved, at least at the pituitary level. in the proposita, treatment of hyperthyrotropinemia is clearly mandatory because of potential complications inflicted by tsh-stimulated growth of
the lingual tissue. to our knowledge, this represents the first report of congenital hypothyroidism secondary to
thyroid dysgenesis complicated by coincidental rth.

introduction

e

ctopic thyroid,

resulting from a defect in the migration
of the median thyroid anlage, is by far the most common
cause of congenital hypothyroidism due to thyroid dysgenesis, accounting for about 80% of cases (1,2). most frequently,
the ectopic thyroid tissue is found at the lingual position. although microscopic lingual thyroid tissue seems to be common, with an incidence of 1:10 in cadaver dissections (3,4),
the incidence of clinically apparent lingual thyroid is likely
closer to 1:100,000 (5). in these cases, there is usually no other
thyroid tissue at the normal position and the ectopic thyroids
are almost always hypoplastic because they lack the normal
lateral expansion (1).
resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is characterized by
decreased responsiveness to thyroid hormone and is most
commonly caused by mutations in the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx - (tr) gene that produce a dominant negative effect

(6,7). rth has an estimated minimal incidence of about
1:40,000 based on follow-up of newborns with elevated
screening total  xxxd1863xxx  (tt4) values (8). the typical constellation of thyroid test abnormalities in serum of subjects
with rth is elevated free thyroid hormones in conjunction
with normal or slightly elevated level of  xxxd3368xxx  (tsh).
although not classified as congenital hypothyroidism, this
syndrome is clinically variable, and usually includes features
of both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism (6,7). furthermore, even though serum tsh concentrations in rth may
be slightly elevated, detection of rth by a positive neonatal tsh screening test has been described in rare cases (9–11).
herein we describe an unusual case with two congenital thyroid conditions, lingual ectopy of the thyroid gland and rth.

riod. delivery (birth weight, 3630 g) and neonatal course
were normal. newborn screening revealed a tsh greater
than 400 mu/l, confirmed by an umbilical cord blood tsh
of 350 mu/l (normal range,  20). in the same sample, tt4
was normal (6.8 ng/dl; normal range, 5–12). both knee epiphyses were visualized on x-ray. a scintiscan showed uptake at the base of the tongue, but none at the normal thyroidal position, consistent with lingual ectopy of the thyroid
gland. at 2 weeks of age, her tsh remained elevated at 300
mu/l, and she was started on levothyroxine ( xxxd2750xxx ). at the
age of 5 months, her tsh remained elevated (60 mu/l), but
the pediatrician chose to withdraw  xxxd2750xxx  treatment in light of
an elevated free  xxxd1863xxx  (ft4) of 31 ng/dl (normal range,
10–25). for the next 5 years, while not receiving  xxxd2750xxx  therapy,
her ft4 stayed in the normal range with persistently elevated
serum tsh concentrations. her physical and intellectual development was unremarkable. at the age of 5.5 years, having tsh of 100 mu/l with tt4 of 6.7 ng/dl,  xxxd2750xxx  was
restarted by another consultant pediatrician. despite mild
elevation of ft4 and high normal to slightly increased free
triiodothyronine (ft3), her tsh remained elevated. at the
age of 15.5 years, when on a daily  xxxd2750xxx  dose of 200 g, her
tsh was 14 mu/l with ft4 of 26.6 ng/dl and ft3 of 7.5
pg/dl (normal range, 3–9). a 99mtc-pertechnetate scintigraphy, performed after withdrawal of  xxxd2750xxx  for 3 weeks, confirmed the finding of a lingual thyroid with a normal uptake
of 1.2% at 20 minutes (fig. 1a and 1b). the lingual tissue
could be visualized by laryngoscopy (fig. 1c).
after transfer to the adult endocrinology service, at age
16, the patient’s  xxxd2750xxx  dose was increased to 300 g/d. although she had appeared to be clinically euthyroid throughout childhood, she reported subjective improvement in wellbeing with the increase in the  xxxd2750xxx  dose. ft4 and ft3 were
now clearly elevated at 35.1 ng/dl and 6.7 pg/dl, respectively, while tsh was only slightly increased at 5.5 mu/l,
a constellation of test results typical for rth. physical and
emotional development proceeded normally without attention deficit disorder. she had completed the 11th grade with
above average achievements. hearing was normal.
both parents were caucasian born in new zealand. a paternal grandfather was of indian origin. they were clinically
euthyroid, although the mother had a small diffuse goiter.

blood samples were obtained from the patient and parents
after securing written informed consent for studies approved
by the institutional review board.
as shown in figure 2a, serum iodothyronine and thyroglobulin concentrations were elevated in the patient and
her mother. tsh level was above the upper limit of normal
only in the patient, presumably because of incomplete compliance with  xxxd2750xxx  intake. in addition, her mother had positive peroxidase autoantibodies, indicating that she also had
autoimmune thyroid disease. all tests of thyroid function
were normal in the father.
direct sequencing of the tr gene of the patient identified
a guanine-to-adenine transition in exon 9, resulting in the substitution of the normal arginine with a histidine at codon 320
(r320h) (fig. 2b). as suspected, the patient’s mother was
found to be a carrier of the same mutation (fig. 2c).
discussion
here we describe a patient with the unique combination
of two congenital conditions affecting normal thyroid hormone physiology. one at the level of thyroid hormone production impairing the ability of the thyroid gland to supply
adequate amounts of thyroid hormone, and the other, rth,
caused by a mutant tr that interferes with the action of
thyroid hormone.
the standard treatment for lingual thyroid is  xxxd2750xxx  supplementation to provide normal thyroid hormone levels, maintain normal tsh and, thus, prevent complications associated
with the potential growth of the thyroid tissue. in the rare
cases of lingual thyroid with presence of orthotopic thyroid
tissue, t4 supplementation might not be required and close
follow-up on the size of the lingual thyroid is sufficient. in
our patient, in the absence of  xxxd2750xxx  therapy, total and ft4 levels were within the normal range, but the serum tsh concentrations were disproportionately high. during the first 5
months of life, when on  xxxd2750xxx  treatment, her tsh level never
normalized even though ft4 was clearly elevated.
it should be noted that numerous reports have documented
elevated serum tsh concentrations in 20%–50% of t4-treated
infants with congenital hypothyroidism, including thyroid ectopy, despite clinical euthyroidism and normal serum thyroid

hormone concentrations (12–15). although the exact pathophysiologic mechanism of this phenomenon remains to be clarified, it has been attributed to an abnormal maturation of the
feedback control of tsh secretion, which may in approximately
10% of cases persist into adulthood (16). in the patient reported
here, the normal concentration of ft4 in the absence of  xxxd2750xxx  treat-

ment had presumably been considered to denote a euthyroid
state. throughout childhood and early adolescence, the patient
had not received  xxxd2750xxx  treatment at all or only at a dose insufficient to normalize serum tsh concentration. only treatment
with a supraphysiologic dose of  xxxd2750xxx  brought her tsh level to
the normal range concomitant with clearly elevated thyroid

rth and lingual ectopy
hormone levels. the situation in our patient is thus similar to
patients with rth who have had thyroid ablation and in whom
the biochemical diagnosis of hormonal resistance is more difficult. under both circumstances, the main feature of rth is
the persistent elevation of tsh levels despite treatment with
doses of thyroid hormones that, under normal circumstances,
are sufficient (17). such patients may be suspected of being
poorly compliant, and a suppression test, using graded doses
of t3, may be useful to clarify the diagnosis (6).
in our patient, the diagnosis of rth was confirmed by genomic sequencing of the tr gene revealing an arginine to histidine mutation in the t3-ligand binding domain (r320h). the
mutation was inherited from the mother, which showed the
abnormalities of thyroid function tests expected in rth (fig.
2a). the r320h mutation causes a rather modest reduction of
t3-binding to 40% of the wild-type tr (18). this mutation has
been identified in members of other unrelated families (19,20)
and is associated with a relatively mild form of rth in terms
of the free thyroid hormone level required to maintain a normal serum tsh concentration. in those families, affected members had only minimal elevation of free t4 and t3 levels with
normal serum tsh concentration. subjects harboring the
r320h mutation also showed normal responses of both positively (ferritin, shbg) and negatively (cholesterol, creatine kinase) regulated peripheral tissue markers of t3 action (18). in
one kindred with this tr-mutation, affected members were
shown to have average to superior intelligence, but were
judged to have significant attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and learning disabilities (19).
while other patients with tr r320h rarely require treatment with thyroid hormone,  xxxd2750xxx  is clearly indicated in the
patient reported here. as shown in figure 3, treatment with
a supraphysiologic  xxxd2750xxx  dose (equivalent to 5 g/kg body
weight) was required to reach ft4 and tsh levels in the
range generally found for untreated patients with this mutation, which we regard as a compensated state. clearly,
maintenance of euthyrotropinemia is also mandatory to prevent complications inflicted by further expansion of the lingual thyroid tissue.
