this spotlight review focuses on the
second-generation proteasome inhibitor
 xxxd441xxx , which was recently approved
by the us food and drug administration
for treatment of relapsed and refractory

multiple myeloma patients who have received at least 2 prior therapies, including
bortezomib and an immunomodulatory
agent, and have demonstrated disease
progression on or within 60 days of the

completion of the last therapy. this review
focuses on clinical trial data leading to drug
approval and provides advice for treating
physicians who are now accessing this drug
for patients. (blood. 2013;121(6):893-897)

introduction
proteasome inhibition is highly effective treatment for multiple
myeloma (mm), waldenström macroglobulinemia, low-grade nonhodgkin lymphomas, and primary amyloidosis.1 almost 10 years
ago, the us food and drug administration (fda) approved the
dipeptidyl boronic acid derivative proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
(btz) for the treatment of refractory mm and subsequently
frontline therapy for mm, thus opening the door to a new era of
improved mm therapy. indeed, disease-free and overall survival
for most mm patients has been significantly extended. nevertheless primary or secondary btz resistance2 is common, and
treatment is often limited by btz-induced, dose-limiting side
effects, mostly consequent to peripheral neuropathy.3 although less
frequent btz administration at lower doses and using subcutaneous delivery4,5 may contribute to a lowered btz neuropathy
incidence and severity without seemingly compromising efficacy,
new proteasome inhibitors—the “second generation”—have now
been developed and are aimed at being potentially more efficacious
and less toxic. the fda recently granted accelerated approval for
 xxxd441xxx  (cfz) injection for the treatment of patients with mm
who have received at least 2 prior therapies, including btz and an
immunomodulatory agent, and who have demonstrated disease
progression on or within 60 days of the completion of last therapy.
this spotlight review focuses on the data leading to drug approval
and provides helpful management tips for treating physicians.
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway inhibition in mm treatment

proteasomes are present in all eukaryotic cells.6,7 they degrade
proteins8,9 and influence a multitude of cellular processes,10-16
including proliferation and dna repair.17-19 proteasome inhibition
leads to an unfolded protein stress response by accumulation of
misfolded proteins in the cell,20-22 inhibits nf-␬b,23 and thus
induces cell-cycle arrest24,25 and apoptosis.26-28 the (malignant)
plasma cell in particular is susceptible to proteasome inhibition,
even to small changes,29 because of its inherent function in ab
production.22,30-32
the proteasome

the constitutive 26s proteasome consists of protein-recognizing
19s regulatory particles and a 20s proteolytic core33 that carries
3 protein-specific29 catalytic sites: the chymotrypsin, trypsin, and

caspase-like sites.34,35 blocking the chymotrypsin-like site is most
effective in cellular growth inhibition in vitro, but coinhibition of
other proteasome subunits further increases overall growth
retardation.35-38 unique immunoproteasomes exist in cells of
immune or hematopoietic origin, where the catalytic sites differ
from the constitutive proteasomes.36 these play an important role
in generating antigens for mhc class i presentation.39 both
constitutive and immunoproteasomes are expressed in mm cells
and are targeted by the available inhibitors btz and cfz. it has not
been fully elucidated whether the anticancer effects depend on
inhibition of one or both proteasome types because study results are
ambiguous.40-43

cfz-specific inhibition of the proteasome

cfz (also known as  xxxd441xxx ) is a cell-permeable tetrapeptide
epoxyketone analog of epoxomicin.44,45 it primarily inhibits the
chymotrypsin-like site of the proteasome (figure 1); in high doses,
it shows additional inhibitory effects on the trypsin-like and
caspase-like sites.46 cfz forms stable and irreversible adducts
exclusively with the proteasome but not with other proteases.45-48
btz, in contrast, forms (slowly) reversible and less specific
adducts predominantly with the chymotrypsin-like and the caspaselike site, but also with a multitude of serine proteases,49-51
potentially contributing to some of the neurotoxicity.

cfz pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics

cfz penetrates all tissues but the brain extensively. it is largely
metabolized extrahepatically and is rapidly cleared from the
circulation by biliary and renal excretion (t1/2 ⫽ 15-30 minutes):
less than 1% is excreted intact.46,52-54 unlike btz, cfz is not
primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome p450,55,56 and therefore plasma levels are minimally dependent on liver function and
concomitant medication.57 because of irreversible binding of cfz,
proteasome function after therapy can only be regained by de novo
proteasome synthesis.52 consecutive daily dosing of cfz is
optimal for inhibition of the proteasome in preclinical studies, thus
leading to the eventual clinical schedule.46

cfz resistance

a significant number of mm patients present with either primary or
secondary proteasome inhibitor resistance. interestingly, some
btz-resistant cell lines41 and patients58 are responsive to cfz
therapy and some cfz-resistant cell lines remain sensitive to btz
treatment.59,60 differences in underlying resistance mechanisms
have not been convincingly elucidated.2,61-67 recently, upregulation of p-glycoprotein could be demonstrated after cfz,
suggesting that drug transport may contribute to resistance.68,69
cfz phase 1 clinical trials

in the first phase 1 trial, cfz was administered in escalating doses
on 5 consecutive days, followed by a 9-day rest period in a 14-day
cycle. sustained proteasome inhibition was achieved; common side
effects were low-grade fatigue and nausea, but no significant
peripheral neuropathy was observed. two cfz-associated doselimiting toxicities (dlt) occurred (thrombocytopenia and febrile
neutropenia). the minimal effective dose (med) was determined
to be 11 mg/m2 and 15 mg/m2 the maximal tolerated dose (mtd).52
in a second phase 1 trial, cfz was given on a 4-week cycle, on
days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 to 37 patients with hematologic
malignancies. five responses were seen in 26 mm patients at doses
above 15 mg/m2 and an mtd was not reached. the highest dose
administered was 27 mg/m2. of all of the patients included, 3 had
serious adverse events (saes) during phase one (sepsis, elevated
liver enzymes, and chemical pancreatitis), all considered possibly
related to cfz. five patients in the expansion cohort had 9 saes,
of which 1 was considered to be cfz related (hypoxia); 1 patient
with a preexisting grade 2 renal impairment developed grade 3
renal failure. although 50% of the patients entered the study with
preexisting peripheral neuropathy, no aggravation to grade 3/4 was
reported.54
cfz phase 2 clinical trials

px 171-003 was the primary trial used for registration purposes
and addressed cfz single-agent activity in a cohort of particularly
poor prognosis and unmet medical need patients. therefore,
266 heavily pretreated mm patients (82% had ⬎ 4 lines of therapy
and 80% were double refractory) were treated with single-agent

cfz in the twice-weekly regimen (see previous paragraph) with a
dose-reduced (20 mg/m2) first cycle to abrogate potential tumorlysis syndrome. dosing in cycle 2 was escalated to 27 mg/m2. the
overall response rate (orr) was 23.7%, with a median duration of
response of 7.8 months, a progression-free survival of 3.7 months,
and an overall survival of 15.6 months. clinical benefit was seen in
one-third of the patients. outcome was not influenced by adverse
cytogenetics, renal impairment, disease stage, or eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance score. five of the
24 deaths in the 266 patients on trial were considered possibly
related to cfz treatment, including 2 cardiac arrests. drug-related
aes of all grades were most frequently fatigue (37%), nausea
(34%), and thrombocythemia. hematologic ae grade 3/4 included
anemia (24%), thrombocytopenia (29%), lymphopenia (20%), and
neutropenia (11%). nonhematologic aes grade 3/4 included
pneumonia (9%), hyponatremia (8.3%), fatigue (7.5%), and hypophosphatemia (6.0%). one-third of the patients experienced mild
to moderate dyspnea without detectable lung injury, possibly
because of extensive hydration patients received. although 77% of
patients had grade 1/2 peripheral neuropathy at study inclusion,
treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy was uncommon
(12.4%) and considered to be cfz related in only 8.3% of patients.
acute renal failure qualifying for an severe ae occurred in 5 of
266 patients and was considered likely to be related to cfz.70
other supportive clinical trials for registration included a phase
2 trial in 129 relapsed but btz-naive mm patients. this trial showed an
impressive single-agent orr of 52%.71 table 1 lists trials including orr data and table 2 lists trials including survival data.
the impact of renal insufficiency in cfz treatment was
investigated in a phase 2 trial in 39 relapsed mm patients with
varying renal impairment. toxicities were manageable and independent of renal status; dose adjustment was not necessary.72,73
in the px-171-010 trial, the long-term safety of cfz treatment
was assessed. no cumulative toxicities, including late development
of peripheral neuropathy or significant emerging renal dysfunction,
were observed.74
the extension of the infusion time from 2-10 minutes to
30 minutes allowed tolerance of higher doses of cfz. dlts were
seen at a dose of 70 mg/m2 and at 56 mg/m2, an impressive

single-agent orr of 60% was achieved. grade 3/4 toxicities were
thrombocytopenia (38%), anemia (21%), and hypertension (13%).75
cfz clinical trials combination therapy

a phase 1 trial (px-171-006) in relapsed mm patients examined
cfz with standard-dose lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in a 28-day cycle (no dlts were observed and the orr was
78%).76 a phase 1/2 trial of this combination was then performed in
newly diagnosed patients. cfz was dose escalated in this study and
a 36 mg/m2 dose was found to be tolerable. after a median of
12 cycles of therapy, the orr was 98%, with an impressive
stringent complete remission rate of 42%.77
cfz plus  xxxd2562xxx  and prednisone (cmp) for elderly patients
with newly diagnosed mm was administered on the usual schedule
twice weekly with a 12-day rest in a 42-day cycle. the mtd was
36 mg/m2 and 2 dlts (fever and hypotension) occurred. the
regimen was judged to be safe and effective. an orr of 92% could
be determined in an interim analysis.78
other reported alkylator combination regimens include
cyclone (cyclophosphamide, cfz, thalidomide, and dexamethasone) for newly diagnosed mm patients, which, again, demonstrated efficacy, with an orr of 100% and deep responses in many
patients.79
cfz practical guidance

the fda-approved label dose and the dose being tested in phase 3
clinical trials is cfz 20 mg/m2 in the first 28-day cycle and, if
tolerated in cycle 1, escalating to 27 mg/m2 for cycle 2 and beyond.
the current vial size of 60 mg is well suited to the 27 mg/m2 dose.
higher doses up to at least 45 mg/m2 were tolerable in limited
phase 1/2 testing, but data on these doses are still accumulating and
this treatment is not currently used outside of clinical trials.

cfz is administered intravenously over 2-10 minutes on
consecutive days each week for 3 weeks (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and
16), followed by a 12-day rest period (days 17-28). if signs of dose
intolerance occur, a dose reduction down to 20 mg/m2 or an
extension of infusion time up to 30 minutes can be considered.
the staged dose escalation between cycles 1 and 2 reflects
concerns from phase 1 testing about possible tumor lysis, early
infusion reaction with fever and dyspnea, and increases in creatinine in the presence of high tumor burden and dehydration.
therefore, current advice is to maintain adequate fluid volume
status throughout treatment and to monitor blood chemistries
closely, particularly in cycle 1. in our practice, this currently means
obtaining laboratory reports on days 1, 2, 3, 8, and 15 in cycle 1 and
on days 1, 8, and 15 thereafter. before each dose in cycle 1, it is
currently recommended—and is our practice—to give 250 ml of
iv fluid before each dose if the patient can tolerate such fluid
challenge. in cycle 2 and beyond, oral hydration is likely adequate.
after hydration and routine allopurinol, tumor lysis on clinical
trials was relatively uncommon. however, concerns have been
voiced that the high incidence of dyspnea and, less frequently,
cardiac events observed may in part reflect fluid overload rather
than drug toxicity. this has led to a relaxation of hydration
guidelines in ongoing clinical trials so that aggressive oral hydration for 24 hours before the first dose rather than iv fluids and cfz
dose escalation beginning on day 8 instead of cycle 2 are being
used. data from these studies are not yet available. even in these
studies, iv hydration is recommended for patients considered at
high risk for tumor lysis.
infusion reactions characterized by a spectrum of systemic
symptoms were observed in early clinical trials. these were most
evident with the first few doses, so the advice is to premedicate in
cycle 1 with dexamethasone 4 mg before all doses of cfz. beyond
cycle 1, dexamethasone prophylaxis can also be stopped if the
patient tolerates the drug.
as with btz treatment, shingles or hepatitis reactivation has
been reported so prophylaxis is recommended.
in conclusion, although the use of tumor-lysis prophylaxis,
premedication with dexamethasone, and dose escalation in cycle 2
may seem cumbersome, many of these preventative measures are
being relaxed in ongoing trials and as results emerge, more
convenient supportive care regimens may be recommended. even
now, we would advise caution with overly aggressive hydration in

elderly, cardiac-,compromised, or hypertensive patients. although
the consecutive daily dosing schedule may be less convenient, it is
important to note that patient compliance has generally been high
in our experience and a consensus opinion of physician clinical trial
participants is that cfz is a well tolerated drug in the majority of
patients and offers the unique benefit of minimal neuropathy.

summary

cfz is a potent proteasome inhibitor and effective therapy in mm
with an advantageous side effect profile characterized by low rates
of peripheral neuropathy and potential use in other diseases as
waldenström macroglobulinemia, lymphoma, amyloidosis, and
autoimmune diseases. in mm, cfz is a welcome addition to btz,
alkylators, corticosteroids, and the immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide and lenalidomide in the therapeutic arsenal. the results of
ongoing phase 2 and multiple phase 3 trials will help to further
define the role of cfz in mm therapy and will help to establish the
best dosing, schedule, and supportive care management that benefit
these patients.
