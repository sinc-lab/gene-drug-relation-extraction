abstract
sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p) is a sphingolipid metabolite that functions as a bioactive lipid molecule. s1p is degraded either by
s1p lyase or by s1p phosphohydrolase. the gene encoding mammalian s1p lyase, spl, has been identiﬁed. here, we characterize
the spl protein in its expression, localization, and topology. the expression levels of the spl protein correlated well with the  xxxd1890xxx -1-phosphate (dhs1p) lyase activity in most tissues. however, liver and heart exhibited high dhs1p lyase activities
compared to their spl protein levels. the spl mrna expression was temporally regulated during mouse embryonal development.
immunoﬂuorescence microscopy demonstrated that spl is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. proteinase k digestion studies
revealed that the large hydrophilic domain, containing the active site, faces the cytosol. this active site orientation is opposite to that
of s1p phosphohydrolase, indicating that the degradation of s1p by two s1p-degrading enzymes occurs in spatially separated sides
of the endoplasmic reticulum.

the bioactive lipid molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate
(s1p) regulates diverse biological processes, including
proliferation, diﬀerentiation, migration, and apoptosis,
by acting as both an extracellular ligand for s1p family
receptors and an intracellular second messenger [1–5].
s1p is synthesized from sphingosine (sph) by sph kinase
and is degraded either by s1p lyase to hexadecenal and
phosphoethanolamine, or by s1p phosphohydrolase to
sph. thus, the overall cellular s1p level is determined
by a balance between its mediated synthesis and
degradation.

the yeast gene  xxxg273xxx /dpl1, which encodes s1p
lyase, was ﬁrst identiﬁed during a study that isolate multicopy suppressors of a sphingosine-sensitive phenotype
[6]. this enzyme was further found to be conserved
among eukaryotes. the mouse s1p lyase gene spl
was later identiﬁed by its similarity to the caenorhabditis
elegans spl gene [7].
since the late 1960s, extensive enzymatic characterization of s1p lyase has been performed, mainly using
the activity present in rat liver [8]. studies have revealed
a requirement for pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate (plp) as a
cofactor and a sensitivity to heavy metal ions and detergent. more recently, the enzyme was determined to be
localized in the microsomal fraction [9–12]. moreover,
it was demonstrated that s1p lyase recognizes as substrates both s1p and  xxxd1890xxx -1-phosphate

(dhs1p), a phospholipid synthesized from de novo
 xxxd1890xxx  (dhs). remarkably, though, this
enzyme exhibits substrate speciﬁcity to only the naturally occurring d (+)- xxxd2033xxx  isomers [10,13–15]. to
date, however, there has been no evidence that spl is
the sole gene encoding a mammalian s1p lyase. therefore, it is unclear whether the known enzymatic characteristics of the s1p lyase, determined using the activity
present in rat liver, are fully attributable to the spl protein. in the current study, we examine the tissue- and
development-dependent expression of spl, by northern
blotting, and the intracellular localization and topology,
by immunoblotting. our results provide evidence that
the large hydrophilic domain of this enzyme, which contains residues involved in the active site, faces the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (er).
considering that the active site of s1p phosphohydrolase is localized on the luminal side of the er, s1p is
likely to be degraded in diﬀerent leaﬂets of the er membrane by two s1p-degrading enzymes.

materials and methods
cell culture and transfection. mouse teratocarcinoma f9 cells and
hela cells were grown in dulbeccoõs modiﬁed eagleõs media d6429 or
d6046, respectively (sigma–aldrich, st. louis, mo), containing 10%
fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 100 u/ml penicillin and
100 lg/ml streptomycin. f9 cells were grown on 0.1% gelatin-coated
dishes. f9-7 cells (spl/, neomycin- and  xxxd3041xxx -sensitive) were
generated from f9-2 cells (spl/, neomycin- and  xxxd3041xxx -resistant) [16]. f9-8 cells are stably transformed f9-7 cells carrying the gene
for n-terminally ha-tagged mouse spl (ha-spl) in f9-7 cells. details of the construction of f9-7 and f9-8 cells will be described elsewhere. transfections were performed using lipofectamine plus and
lipofectamine 2000 reagents for hela cells and f9 cells, respectively,
both from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca).
plasmids. the plasmid pcdna3-flag-spl, which encodes nterminally flag-tagged mouse spl, was constructed by cloning a
1.8 kb bglii–noti fragment of pgem-spl [16] into the bamhi–noti
site of pcdna3-flag1 [17].
a derivative of the pce-puro vector, pce-puro-3·ha4, was designed for use in producing c-terminally, triple ha-tagged (3·ha)
proteins. to generate pce-puro-spl-3·ha, the spl cdna was ﬁrst
ampliﬁed by pcr using primers 5 0 -agatctgccaccatgc
ccggaaccgacctcctcaag-3 0 and 5 0 -gctagcgcgggg
ctttggagaaccgttc-3 0 and the pgem-spl plasmid [16] as a
template. the ampliﬁed fragment was then cloned into pgem-t
easy (promega, madison, wi) to generate the pgem-spl-2 plasmid.
the pce-puro-spl-3·ha was constructed by cloning a 1.8 kb
bglii–nhei fragment of pgem-spl-2 into the bamhi–nhei site of
pce-puro-3·ha4.
measurement of dhs1p lyase activity. a dhs1p lyase assay was
performed in vitro as reported [16], with minor modiﬁcations.
[3h]dhs1p was synthesized by incubating [4,5-3h]d - xxxd2033xxx -dhs
(50 ci/mmol; american radiolabeled chemicals, st. louis, mo) with
puriﬁed yeast long-chain base kinase lcb4p, in the presence of 10 mm
mgcl2 and 2 mm atp, for 2 h at 37 c. the [3h]dhs1p was then
puriﬁed by a two-step extraction method described previously [18] and
suspended in 0.2% triton x-100. lysates were prepared from cultured
cells or various tissues from 8-week-old c57bl/6 cr mice, as described
previously [16,19]. brieﬂy, cells or tissues were sonicated in buﬀer a

10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (dtt), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl
ﬂuoride (pmsf), and 1· protease inhibitor mixture (complete; roche
diagnostics, mannheim, germany)). the resulting lysates were mixed
with a 0.4-fold volume of buﬀer b (0.15 m sodium phosphate (ph7.4),
1.5 mm edta, 37.5 mm sodium ﬂuoride, 18 mm b-glycerophosphate, 0.75 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.9 mm plp, 8.9 mm sodium
orthovanadate, 0.71% triton x-100, 1 mm dtt, 1 mm pmsf, and
1· protease inhibitor mixture) and 2 lci the [3h]dhs1p. the enzyme
reaction was performed by incubating the samples at 37 c and terminated by adding 3.75 volumes of chloroform:methanol:hcl
(100:200:1, v/v/v). lipids were extracted with 1.25 volumes of chloroform and 1.25 volumes of 1% aqueous kcl. phases were separated
by centrifugation, and the organic phase was recovered, dried, and
suspended in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). the lipids were resolved
by tlc on silica gel 60 high performance tlc plates (merck,
darmstadt, germany) with 1-butanol:acetic acid:h2o (3:1:1, v/v/v),
and were visualized by spraying the plates with the ﬂuorographic reagent en3hance spray (perkin–elmer, boston, ma) and exposing
them to x-ray ﬁlm at 80 c.
immunoblotting and immunoﬂuorescence microscopy. cell lysates
were prepared from cultured cells or various mouse tissues, as described previously [16,19]. immunoblotting was performed as reported
[16] using ecl or ecl plus western blotting detection reagents
(amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj). primary antibodies used in
the assay included our aﬃnity-puriﬁed anti-spl antibody [16], the
anti- xxxg334xxx  antibody h-70 (0.2 lg/ml), the anti-ha antibody y-11
(0.2 lg/ml), and the anti- xxxg575xxx  antibody h-70 (0.2 lg/ml), all from
santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, ca), anti-gm130 antibody
(1 lg/ml; bd biosciences, palo alto, ca), and anti-kdel antibody
(2.5 lg/ml; stressgen biotechnologies, san diego, ca). peroxidaselabeled donkey anti-rabbit ig f(ab 0 )2 (diluted 1:10,000) and donkey
anti-mouse ig f(ab 0 )2 (diluted 1:10,000), both from amersham biosciences, were used as secondary antibodies.
immunoﬂuorescence microscopic analysis was performed as described previously [20] using anti-flag m5 (5 lg/ml; sigma) and
anti- xxxg323xxx  (5 lg/ml; alexis, lausen, switzerland) antibodies.
alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse igg (3.3 lg/ml), and alexa 594conjugated anti-rabbit igg (5 lg/ml) antibodies, both from molecular
probes (eugene, or) were used as secondary antibodies. cells were
observed under an lsm510 confocal laser scanning microscope (carl
zeiss, oberkochen, germany) with a 63· lens (carl zeiss).
preparation of smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum. liver was
isolated from an adult c57bl/6 j mouse, washed with cold phosphatebuﬀered saline (pbs), and lysed, using an electric potter homogenizer
for 10 strokes, in buﬀer c (10 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose,
5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm dtt, 1 mm pmsf, and 1· protease inhibitor
mixture). after one centrifugation at 8000g at 4 c for 10 min, the
supernatant was further centrifuged at 105,000g at 4 c for 1 h. the
resulting pellet (microsomal fraction) was suspended in 1.67 ml buﬀer
c and then mixed with 2.51 ml of a 2.1 m sucrose solution in buﬀer d
(50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5), 5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm dtt, 1 mm pmsf,
and 1· protease inhibitor mixture). this mixture (ﬁnal concentration
1.35 m sucrose) was layered onto 3 ml of a solution of 2.1 m sucrose in
buﬀer d, and covered with 3 ml of a 0.8 m sucrose solution in buﬀer
d, thereby providing a sucrose gradient. samples were centrifuged at
105,000g at 4 c for 6 h. the smooth er (ser) at the 0.8 m/1.35 m
sucrose interface and the rough er (rer) at the 1.35 m/2.1 m sucrose interface were collected.
preparation of soluble and membrane fractions. f9-8 cells were
washed twice with pbs, suspended in buﬀer e (20 mm hepes–naoh
(ph 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm dtt, 1 mm pmsf, and 1· protease
inhibitor mixture), and sonicated. after centrifugation at 300g for
3 min at 4 c, the resulting supernatant (total lysate) was treated with
an equal volume of buﬀer e, 0.2 m na2co3 (ph 11.5), 0.2 m naoh,
5 m urea, or 2 m nacl. after a 1 h incubation at 4 c, the mixtures

were centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h at 4 c to separate soluble and
membrane fractions.
proteinase k digestion. f9-7 cells transfected with pce-puro-spl3·ha were washed twice with pbs, suspended in buﬀer e, and lysed
using an electric potter homogenizer for 10 strokes. after removal of
cell debris by centrifuging at 300g for 3 min at 4 c, the supernatant
was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000g for 1 h at 4 c. the
resulting pellet was suspended in buﬀer e (without protease inhibitors)
and treated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase k on ice for 1 h, in the presence
or absence of 1% triton x-100. after termination of the digestion with
1 mm pmsf, total proteins were precipitated with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min. protein precipitates were washed with 5%
trichloroacetic acid and with acetone, and were then suspended in sds
sample buﬀer (62.5 mm tris–hcl (ph 6.8), 2% sds, 10% glycerol,
and a trace amount of bromophenol blue) containing 1 mm pmsf.
proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel by sds–page
and subjected to immunoblotting as above.
northern blotting. total rna blots containing 20 lg rna from
several mouse embryo stages were purchased from seegene (seoul,
korea). a probe for the spl mrna was prepared using a 0.53-kb
dna fragment corresponding to the middle region of the spl orf.
this fragment was ampliﬁed using primers 5 0 -ggcgttagaga
aggggatcaaaactcc-3 0 and 5 0 -ccaggccgtgagccagct
atgcttgg-3 0 from pgem-spl plasmid [16]. the ampliﬁed fragments were then gel-puriﬁed and labeled with [a-32p]dctp (3000 ci/
mmol; perkin–elmer life and analytical sciences, boston, ma) by
random priming, using random primer dna labeling kit ver.2
(takara bio, shiga, japan). after hybridization with expresshyb
buﬀer (bd biosciences clontech, palo alto, ca) at 68 c for 2 h, the
membrane was washed and exposed to x-ray ﬁlm at 80 c.

tissue distribution of spl
gene expression of mouse spl has been analyzed
only by northern blotting in a limited number of tissues
[7]. to investigate the tissue-speciﬁc expression of the
spl protein more extensively, immunoblotting was performed on samples from 12 diﬀerent mouse tissues. as
shown in fig. 1a, expression levels of the spl protein
were highest in small intestine and thymus. spleen also
expressed high levels of the spl protein, whereas liver,
kidney, lung, stomach, and testis expressed only moderate levels, and brain, heart, and skeletal muscle barely
detectable amounts (left panel). spl was also not detected in platelets, the only tissue known to have no
s1p lyase activity [21]. even after a longer ﬁlm exposure,
which aided detection in heart and skeletal muscle (right
panel), no expression was observed in platelets.
we also measured in vitro the dhs1p lyase activities
in the tissue lysates. as shown in fig. 1b, the highest
activity was detected in small intestine and thymus, followed by liver and spleen. most of these high activities
correlated well with the high protein levels of spl, except in liver, which expressed only intermediate levels
of spl. testis, heart, lung, kidney, and stomach all displayed moderate activity, whereas brain and skeletal
muscle exhibited low activity, and platelets no activity.

again, the relatively high dhs1p lyase activity in heart
did not correlate with the very low expression of spl.
subcellular localization of spl
we investigated the intracellular localization of spl
in detail. indirect immunoﬂuorescent microscopic analysis demonstrated that flag-tagged spl expressed in
hela cells was localized at the er, as its ﬂuorescence
completely merged with that of  xxxg323xxx , an er protein (fig. 2a). the er is categorized into two subcompartments, the rough er (rer) and smooth er (ser),
by the presence or absence of ribosomes. the ser is
abundant only in certain cell types including steroid-synthesizing cells and liver cells, and it plays an important
role in lipid metabolism. although most membrane proteins are shared between the rer and ser, some proteins, especially those involved in lipid metabolism such
as cytochrome p-450, are enriched only in the ser [22].
we investigated the distribution of spl between the
rer and ser in mouse liver extracts using microsomes
prepared by sucrose-density gradient centrifugation.
spl, together with er chaperones such as  xxxg334xxx ,
 xxxg1099xxx , and  xxxg1101xxx , was recovered nearly equally from

was dissociated from the membrane by alkaline or urea
treatment (fig. 3, lower panel). these data indicated
that spl is an integral membrane protein, which is consistent with the prediction that spl contains a transmembrane segment at the n-terminus.
we further investigated the orientation within the er
membrane of the large hydrophilic domain in spl that
follows the putative n-terminal transmembrane segment. for this purpose, intact organelles prepared from
f9-7 cells transiently transfected with the pce-puro
spl-3·ha plasmid were treated with proteinase k in
the presence or absence of triton x-100.  xxxg334xxx , a
type i membrane protein with an n-terminal large domain facing towards the lumen of the er [23], was used
as a control for preparing the intact er. upon treatment with proteinase k in the absence of triton
x-100, the c-terminal tail of  xxxg334xxx  was digested, generating calnexindc (fig. 4a, lane 8). on the other hand,
no similarly protected band for the spl protein was detected by immunoblotting with either an anti-spl or
anti-ha antibody (fig. 4a, lanes 2 and 5, repectively).

membrane topology of spl
we also examined the membrane association of spl
under various conditions using f9-8 cells, which stably
express ha-tagged spl. the association was not disturbed by alkaline, urea, or high salt treatment (fig. 3,
upper panel). these results were similar to those for
the integral membrane protein marker  xxxg334xxx  (fig. 3,
middle panel), but contrasted sharply with those for
the peripheral membrane protein marker gm130, which

fig. 3. spl is a membrane-spanning protein. total lysates prepared
from f9-8 cells (spl//ha-spl) were treated with buﬀer, 0.1 m
na2co3, 0.1 m naoh, 2.5 m urea, or 1 m nacl, separated by
centrifugation at 100,000g for 1 h into soluble (s) and membrane (m)
fractions, and examined by immunoblotting with an anti-ha, anticalnexin, or anti-gm130 antibody. cnx,  xxxg334xxx .

fig. 5. the expression of spl mrna is developmentally regulated.
(upper panel) a 32p-labeled spl probe was hybridized to 20 lg of
total rna from each stage of mouse embryo. (lower panel) 28s and
18s ribosomal rnas were stained with ethidium bromide to demonstrate uniform rna loading.

these results indicated that the large hydrophilic domain of spl is exposed to the cytosol.
spl expression during mouse embryogenesis
recently, it was reported that spl expression was
developmentally regulated in dictyostelium discoideum,
c. elegans, and drosophila melanogaster [24–26]. we
also previously demonstrated that spl expression is increased during in vitro primitive endoderm diﬀerentiation using embryonic carcinoma (ec) f9 cells [16].
however, whether, how, and to what extent expression
of spl is regulated during mouse development remains
unclear. therefore, we examined the developmental
stage speciﬁc expression pattern of spl mrna by
northern blotting. spl mrna was expressed throughout mouse embryogenesis. additionally, a transient increase was observed from embryonic day (e) 5.5 to e
7.5 (fig. 5).

discussion
s1p lyase activity had already been detected by the
late 1960s [27–32], and its enzymatic characteristics,
including substrate speciﬁcity, localization, and tissue
distribution, were investigated extensively. however,
identiﬁcation of the mammalian gene (spl) encoding
s1p lyase occurred only recently in 1998 [7] and direct
studies regarding gene expression have been few. we
investigated the tissue distribution patterns of the spl
protein and the dhs1p lyase activity in detail and
found some inconsistencies (fig. 1). our results for the
dhs1p lyase activity of various mouse tissues were similar to previous results for several rat tissues [8], and
most activities correlated with the expression levels of
the protein (fig. 1). however, although the spl protein
levels in liver were equivalent to those in lung, stomach,
testis, and kidney, the activity in liver was approximately 2-fold higher than activities in the other tissues.
furthermore, the amount of spl in liver was much less
than that in spleen, yet the activities in these tissues were
nearly equal (fig. 1). in addition, spl was barely detectable in heart, while the activity in this tissue was comparable to that in kidney or lung (fig. 1). it is possible that

another s1p lyase exists, and that liver and heart express
the second enzyme in high amounts. alternatively, the
activities of spl may be up-regulated in liver and heart.
we prefer the former possibility, since the spl-null cells
(f9-7) still possess weak but signiﬁcant s1p lyase activity (m. ikeda, a. kihara, y. kariya, and y. igarashi,
unpublished results).
s1p functions as a bioactive lipid molecule not only
extracellularly but also intracellularly. its intracellular
levels are maintained by a balance in the activities of
the synthesizing enzyme, sph kinase, and the degrading
enzymes, s1p lyase and s1p phosphohydrolase. in addition to their contributions to signaling, these enzymes
seem to play important roles in regulating the cellular
amounts of sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids,
since some tissues, such as small intestine and thymus,
possess high activities for both sph kinase [19] and
s1p lyase (fig. 1b). small intestine might actively convert sphingolipids absorbed from food into
glycerophospholipids.
immunoﬂuorescence microscopic analysis indicated
that mouse spl is localized at the er (fig. 2a), which
is consistent with a recent report regarding human spl
[33]. separation of the ser and rer by sucrose density
gradient centrifugation demonstrated that spl is
equally distributed between the ser and rer (fig.
2b). the membrane association of spl was resistant
to alkaline, urea, and high salt treatments, suggesting
that spl is an integral membrane protein (fig. 3). proteinase k digestion assays revealed that most of the spl
protein is exposed to the cytosol (fig. 4a). from these
results and predictions deduced from its sequence, we
propose a structural model for the spl protein as
illustrated in fig. 4b. in this model, spl has one transmembrane segment at its n-terminus, with its large
c-terminal domain facing the cytosol. spl is a plp-dependent enzyme, and its lys residue (lys-353) is an active site that forms an internal schiﬀ base with plp. the
pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase conserved domain
which contains lys-353 is located in the c-terminal domain, suggesting that s1p is cleaved to hexadecenal and
phosphoethanolamine on the cytosolic side of the er
membrane. the subcellular localization and topology
of spl revealed here are in agreement with previous
enzymatic analyses of a s1p lyase [12]. this membrane
topology is reasonable since glycerophospholipid synthesis also takes place in the cytoplasmic leaﬂet of the
er membrane bilayer. interestingly, though, the active
site of another s1p-degrading enzyme, s1p phosphohydrolase, is exposed to the opposite side of the er membrane, the er lumen [34]. thus, the location at which
these two enzymes degrade s1p diﬀers.
using f9 cells, we recently demonstrated that spl is
regulated in its expression during ec to primitive endoderm diﬀerentiation and that it is involved in this diﬀerentiation [16]. in the study presented here, we revealed that

m. ikeda et al. / biochemical and biophysical research communications 325 (2004) 338–343

expression of spl is also regulated during embryogenesis.
the expression was transiently increased during e 5.5 to e
7.5 (fig. 5). e 7.5 is the approximate beginning of gastrulation, in which pronounced diﬀerentiation and rearrangement are observed. therefore, it is possible that
spl has a role in mouse development, although further
studies using spl knock-out mice are required.
