 xxxg1110xxx  receptor agonists and human coronary artery reactivity in vitro: crossover comparisons of 5-ht and sumatriptan with  xxxd3135xxx  and l-741,519.  1.  xxxd3135xxx  ( xxxd3135xxx , (n,n-dimethyl-2-[5-( xxxd17xxx -1-ylmethyl)-1h-indol-3-yl] ethylamine)) and its structurally related analogue l-741,519 (n-methyl-4-[5-( xxxd17xxx -4-yl)-1h-indol-3-yl]piperidine) are novel  xxxg1110xxx -receptor agonists.  xxxd3135xxx  has shown efficacy as an anti-migraine agent in clinical trials. since angiographic studies in patients have shown that sumatriptan (an established  xxxg1110xxx -receptor agonist) can cause coronary artery vasoconstriction, we compared the effects of  xxxd3135xxx  and l-741,519 with those of 5-ht and sumatriptan on endothelium-denuded segments of human coronary artery in vitro. 2. coronary arteries were obtained from explanted hearts from patients undergoing cardiac transplantation (n = 16 viable arteries from 13 males, 3 females, aged 38-68 years) and arterial segments (5-6 mm in length) were mounted in organ baths for isometric tension recording. each segment was first exposed to 45mm kcl and then to 5-ht (1 nm-100 microm). concentration-effect curves to  xxxd3135xxx  and sumatriptan (study 1, n = 6 or 7 arteries) or sumatriptan and l-741,519 (study 2, n = 8 arteries) were then performed in a consecutive and random manner. the response to repeated application of 5-ht was obtained in separate segments. 3. one artery showed severe atheroma and was not included in the analysis. anova showed that 5-ht responsiveness varied significantly between arteries from different patients; but not between arterial segments from the same patient. desensitization was seen consistently across all agonists but did not significantly affect inter-agonist comparisons. 4. there was graded effectiveness in the ability of the agonists to cause contraction with the rank order of emax values being 5-ht >> sumatriptan > l-741,519 >  xxxd3135xxx . in terms of ec50 values, l-741,519 was significantly more potent than sumatriptan. 5. the present study (using a 'cross-over' experimental protocol) confirms our previous observation that  xxxd3135xxx  is less effective than sumatriptan in causing contraction of human isolated coronary artery. furthermore, it shows that the lower maximum contractile response to  xxxd3135xxx , compared with that of sumatriptan, is not merely the consequence of variability in response to  xxxg1110xxx -receptor agonists between patients or between segments from the same artery.
