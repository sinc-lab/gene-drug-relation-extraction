histidine triad nucleotide binding protein (hint)2 belongs to
a histidine triad (hit) superfamily that has a characteristic
c-terminal active site motif, hxhxhxx, where x is a hydrophobic residue (1). hit enzymes are a ubiquitous superfamily

otide hydrolyases, and nucleotidyltransferases (1). five distinct
branches of hit superfamily have been recently classified by a
phylogenetic study of hit proteins (2, 3). recently,  xxxg1050xxx 
homologs isolated from rabbit (4), human (5), chicken (6), yeast
(4), and escherichia coli (5) have been shown to be  xxxd2705xxx  phosphoramidases. human  xxxg1050xxx  has been shown to
associate with, and possibly regulate several transcription factors such as  xxxg725xxx  (7), mitf (8, 9), and usf2 (10). additionally,
 xxxg1050xxx  knock out mice have been shown to have an increased
susceptibility to the induction of ovarian and mammary tumors
by the carcinogen dimethylbenzanthracene and to spontaneous
tumors (11). up-regulation of  xxxg1050xxx  and the significantly
reduced in vivo tumorigenicity of  xxxd1823xxx -treated non-smallcell lung cancer cell line nci-h522 suggested that hhint1
might be a tumor suppressor (12). recently, weiske and huber
(13) reported that  xxxg1050xxx  triggers apoptosis independent of its
phosphoramidase activity (13). human hint2, which is 61%
identical to  xxxg1050xxx , has recently been shown to be a mitochondrial apoptotic sensitizer that is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinomas (14). although hints are efficient hydrolases
of  xxxd2705xxx  phosphoramidates, cellular function and
biochemical relevance of the enzymatic phosphoramidase
activity has not been determined.
the  xxxg797xxx  ( xxxg797xxx ) branch of the hit superfamily is only found in eukaryotes. like hint,  xxxg797xxx  is also a
homodimer with tumor suppressor activity (15). human  xxxg797xxx  is
a diadenosine p1,p3-triphosphate (ap3a) hydrolyase as well as
phosphoramidase (16, 17). the precise mechanism of action by
which it affects tumor development is not well understood,
although site-directed mutagenesis studies have indicated that
the  xxxg797xxx  tumor suppressor function is likely not dependent
on its  xxxg797xxx  activity (18). in contrast to the first
two branches, the galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase
branch has been shown to be the second enzyme in the leloir
pathway necessary for galactose utilization (19, 20). although,
galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is a homodimer with
little overall sequence homology with  xxxg1050xxx  or  xxxg797xxx , it does
share some tertiary structure similarity (21). the fourth family
is aprataxin, which is mutated in ataxia-oculomotor apraxia1
(22, 23) and possesses phosphoramidase and ap4a hydrolase
activity as well as dna/rna binding properties (2); recently,
the physiological substrate for aprataxin has been shown to be
abortive adenylated dna ligation intermediates (3). the last
family is the scavenger  xxxg613xxx , dcps/
 xxxg613xxx , a 7-methyl-gpppg hydrolase (24, 25).
recently, hhint1 has been isolated from complexes with
 xxxg1225xxx  ( xxxg1225xxx ) and mitf or usf2 transcription factors (9, 10). to elucidate the biochemical connection

histidine triad nucleotide binding proteins (hints) are the
most ancient members of the histidine triad protein superfamily
of nucleotidyltransferases and hydrolyases. protein-protein
interaction studies have found that complexes of the transcription factors mitf or usf2 and  xxxg1225xxx  ( xxxg1225xxx )
are associated with human  xxxg1050xxx . therefore, we hypothesized
that lysyl-amp or the lysrs䡠lysyl-amp may be a native substrate for hints. to explore the biochemical relationship
between  xxxg1050xxx  and  xxxg1225xxx , a series of catalytic radiolabeling,
mutagenesis, and kinetic experiments was conducted with purified lysrss and hints from human and escherichia coli. after
incubation of the e. coli or human  xxxg1225xxx  with hints and
[␣-32p]atp, but not [␣-32p]gtp, 32p-labeled hints were
observed. by varying time and the concentrations of lysine,
mg2ⴙ, or  xxxg1225xxx , the adenylation of hint was found to be
dependent on the formation of lysyl-amp. site-directed
mutagenesis studies of the active site histidine triad revealed
that hint labeling could be abolished by substitution of either
his-101 of e. coli hint or his-112 of human  xxxg1050xxx  by either
alanine or glycine. ap4a, believed to be synthesized by  xxxg1225xxx  in
vivo, and zn2ⴙ were shown to inhibit the formation of hintamp with an ic50 value in the low micromolar range. consistent with pyrophosphate being an inhibitor for aminoacyl-trna
synthetase, incubations in the presence of pyrophosphatase
resulted in enhanced formation of hint-amp. these results
demonstrate that the lysyl-amp intermediate formed by  xxxg1225xxx 
is a natural substrate for hints and suggests a potential highly
conserved regulatory role for hints on  xxxg1225xxx  and possibly other
aminoacyl-trna synthetases.

hint is a lysyl-amp hydrolase
between  xxxg1225xxx  and  xxxg1050xxx , both e. coli  xxxg1225xxx  (eclysu) and
human  xxxg1225xxx  (hlysrs) were purified and shown to label
echint and hhint1 with [␣-32p]atp but not with [␥-32p]atp,
[␣-32p]gtp, or [␥-32p]gtp. this was found to be consistent
with chemical degradation and mutagenic experiments revealing that the hint-amp intermediate formed upon interaction
with  xxxg1225xxx  contained a phosphoramidate linkage between
amp and a strictly conserved and catalytically essential active
site histidine (his-112 of hhint1, fig. 1). furthermore, by varying individual components in the aminoacylation reaction, the
formation of the hint-amp intermediate was found to be
dependent on the formation of the lysyl-amp intermediate.
hence, hints may function in part to regulate the catalytic
activity of  xxxg1225xxx  by providing a possible new mechanism of
pre-transfer editing or by scavenging highly reactive inappropriately released aminoacyl-adenylates. moreover, the interaction of  xxxg1050xxx  with transcription factors such as usf2 and mitf
may be mediated by the adenylation of  xxxg1050xxx  by  xxxg1225xxx .

experimental procedures
protein purification—the e. coli bs68 strain harboring the
pbas39 (derived from pet3a) plasmid for expressing eclysu as
a c-terminal his6-tag fusion protein was a gift from dr. paul
schimmel (the scripps research institute) (26). the plasmid
pm368 encoding hlysrs expresses a fusion protein containing the n-terminal mrgshhhhhhssgwvd sequence
appended to full-length hlysrs was a gift from dr. karin musierforsyth (university of minnesota) (27). both  xxxg1225xxx  enzymes were
purified by using ni2⫹-agarose binding according to a previously
published procedure (27). wild type and mutants of hhint1 and
echint were purified by an amp-agarose column from echint
knock out strain (bb2) as described previously (5).
labeling of hints by purified e. coli lysu—e. coli lysu
(6.25 ␮m) was incubated with [␣-32p]atp or [␣-32p]gtp (0.33
␮m, 800 ci/mmol, mp biomedicals) in buffer a (10 ␮l, 25 mm
tris hcl, ph 7.8, 100 mm nacl, 2 mm mgcl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor tablet (roche applied science)) at 23 °c
for 10 min followed by the addition of either buffer a (5 ␮l),
echint (5 ␮l, 1.25, 3, or 7.5 ␮m), hhint1 (5 ␮l, 1.25, 3, or 7.5 ␮m),
or the chimera mutant (5 ␮l, 1.25, 3, or 7.5 ␮m) and incubated
for 10 min. the reaction was terminated by the addition of sds
sample buffer (4⫻, 5 ␮l, invitrogen). the reaction mixture was
boiled for 10 min, and the proteins were separated by sdspage and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane. labeled proteins were visualized by subjecting
dried polyvinylidene difluoride membranes to autoradiography
with a storage phosphor screen for 12 h followed by scanning
with a storm 840 phosphorimager.
lysyl-amp-dependent adenylation of hints by e. coli lysu
and human  xxxg1225xxx —the concentration of eclysu, hlysrs,
lysine, [␣-32p]atp, mg 2⫹, zn 2⫹, nucleotides, yeast inorganic
pyrophosphatase (sigma), hint proteins, and incubation time
period for each experiment is described in the legends to figs.
3–9. the reactions were terminated by the addition of sds
sample buffer (4⫻), and samples were analyzed as described
above. quantitation of the intensity of the 32p signal was carried
out with imagequant software (ge healthcare).

10 mm nacl, 10 mm mgcl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03 unit/␮l
 xxxg1804xxx ) at 23 °c. aliquots (2 ␮l) were withdrawn and quenched in ice-cold sodium acetate solution (200 mm,
ph 5.0). after 10 or 30 min, echint (2.5 ␮m) was added to the
remaining reaction mixture, and amp formation was monitored for an additional 10 min. aliquots of quenched reactions
(1 ␮l) were spotted in duplicate on polyethyleneimine-cellulose
plates (20 ⫻ 10 cm, selecto scientific) pre-developed with
water. the air-dried tlc plate was developed in ammonium
acetate (100 mm), 5% acetic acid solution. the 32p signal was
detected and quantitated as described above.

results
the chimeric mutant of hhint1 and echint—human  xxxg1050xxx 
and echint shared 50% sequence identity over 107 alignable
amino acids, but their c termini are distinct. the c terminus
may play an important role on determining substrate specificity. homology modeling studies revealed that the c termini of
echint are likely to reside in a similar location to that of the
hhint1.3 to address this possibility, a human/e. coli chimera
was created by replacing the c terminus of hhint1 (gln-120 to
gly-126) with the c terminus of echint (pro-109 to leu-119).

figure 3. enhanced adenylation of echint by eclysu by the addition of
lysine. incubation of eclysu (0.22 ␮m) was carried out at 23 °c for 10 min with
[␣-32p]atp (0.38 ␮m) in buffer a followed by the addition of echint (0.28 or 2.8 ␮m)
for 10 min (lanes 2 and 4) and in buffer a containing lysine (2.2 ␮m) followed by
the addition of echint (0.28 or 2.8 ␮m) for 10 min (lanes 3 and 5). the addition
of lysine enhanced the amount of hint-amp by factors of 11 or 5.

nucleotidylation of hints by eclysu—adenylation but not
guanylation of hints was observed after incubation with eclysu
(fig. 2a), whereas the control experiments without eclysu (fig.
2a, lanes 1, 5, and 8) revealed negligible labeling of hints.
adenylation of echint (fig. 2a, lanes 3 and 4, 13 kda), hhint1
(fig. 2a, lanes 6 and 7, 14 kda), and the chimera mutant (fig.
2a: lanes 9 and 10, 14 kda) was compared which demonstrate
that labeling of echint and the chimera was more intense than
the labeling of hhint1, indicating the potential role of the c-terminal loop in facilitating labeling. in contrast to adenylation,
incubation of eclysu with [␣-32p]-gtp revealed weak labeling
of eclysu (59 kda) after the addition of hhint1 (fig. 2b, lane 3)
and the chimera (fig. 2b, lane 4) but no labeling with only buffer
a (fig. 2b, lane 1) or echint (fig. 2b, lane 2).
enhanced adenylation of hint by eclysu by the addition of
lysine—to first investigate whether the  xxxg1225xxx  activity associated with eclysu was responsible for the
adenylation of hints, the effect of lysine on hint-amp formation was evaluated. incubation of eclysu (0.22 ␮m) was
carried out at 23 °c for 10 min with [␣-32p]atp (0.38 ␮m) in
buffer a followed by the addition of echint (0.28 or 2.8 ␮m)
for 10 min (fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4) and in buffer a containing
lysine (2.2 ␮m) followed by the addition of echint (0.28 or 2.8 ␮m)
for 10 min (lanes 3 and 5). the addition of lysine (2.2 ␮m) enhanced
hint-amp formation by 11-fold, when the eclysu (0.22 ␮m)
and echint (0.28 ␮m) were comparable in concentration. consistent with a saturable process, when the amount of echint was
increased by 10-fold, only a 5-fold increase in labeling was

echint (0.5 ␮m, 1 ␮m, lanes 3 and 4), hhint1 (lanes 6 and 7), and the chimera

hint is a lysyl-amp hydrolase

observed. because the small amount of hint-amp was
observed in the absence of added lysine (fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4), it
is highly likely that a small amount of contaminating lysine or
lysyl-amp bound with eclysu is present with the purified
enzyme. in addition, at the higher echint concentration, we do
observe small amounts of labeled eclysu (fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5,
59 kda), possibly indicating that at high enough concentrations
of hint, adenylation of eclysu can be observed.
time dependence of hint adenylation by eclysu—to evaluate the rate of adenylate-hint formation, after preincubation of
eclysu (0.022 ␮m), lysine (2.2 ␮m), and [␣-32p]atp (0.38 ␮m)
for 1 min, excess echint (1.4 ␮m) was added to initiate the
reaction; the reaction was carried out for an additional 8 min
with aliquots removed and quenched at 1-min intervals. as
shown in fig. 4, maximal hint-amp formation was observed
between 1 and 3 min after initiation. consistent with rapid
consumption of atp by eclysu and turnover of the hintamp intermediate, over the course of the next 5 min, a
6-fold decrease in the intensity of echint labeling was
observed. in subsequent experiments, the labeling of echint
was carried out for maximum of 1 min.
adenylation of eclysu by echint—incubation of eclysu
(0.022 ␮m) with lysine and [␣-32p]-atp for 1 min followed by the
addition of various concentrations of echint (0.056 –14 ␮m)
revealed that the intensity of the hint-amp was proportional to
the added amount of echint, reaching a plateau between 1.4
and 2.8 ␮m. moreover, labeling of eclysu was noticeable when
incubations were carried out with at least a 56-fold excess of
echint. the prevalence of an additional higher mr band, consistent in size with covalently linked eclysu and echint, was
observed at the highest echint concentration (14 ␮m) (fig. 5).
the possibility that this band may result from the labeling of
 xxxg1225xxx  at multiple sites cannot be ruled out. labeling of the high
mr band and eclysu is likely to suppress the amount of
observed echint-amp.

figure 5. adenylation of eclysu by echint. incubation of eclysu (0.022 ␮m)
was carried out at 23 °c in buffer a containing lysine (2.2 ␮m) with [␣-32p]atp
(0.35 ␮m) for 1 min followed by the addition of echint (0.056 –14 ␮m) and
incubation for 1 min. maximal hint-amp formation was observed at 2.8 ␮m
echint. formation of eclysu-amp was observed after the concentration of
echint reached 1.4 ␮m. the intensity of the eclysu-amp was increased with
higher concentrations of echint (2.8 ⬃ 4 ␮m). moreover, the eclysu/echintamp complex or multiple adenylated eclysu was observed at 14 ␮m echint.

adenylation of hint is dependent on the concentration of
lysine and mg2⫹—because lysine is one of the substrates and
mg2⫹ is absolutely required for lysyl-amp formation (30), it is
of interest to determine the effect of both molecules on adenylation of echint in more detail. hence, various concentrations
of lysine (0.025–2500 ␮m) were examined to reveal a saturation-type behavior with respect to the amount of lysine; under
these conditions maximal intensity was observed at 25 ␮m
lysine (fig. 6a). in addition, labeling was observed only when
mg2⫹ was present in the reaction mixture, with maximal intensity reached at a concentration of 1500 ␮m (fig. 6b). taken
together, the observed reliance of echint adenylation on lysine
and mg2⫹ is consistent with a labeling reaction dependent on
the formation of lysyl-amp by eclysu.
inhibition of hint adenylation by zn2⫹, ap4a, and ap3a—
divalent zn2⫹ has been shown to stimulate ap4a formation by
eclysu. the mechanism has been shown to rely on the ability of
zn2⫹ to stimulate nucleophilic attack by the ␥-phosphate of atp
on lysyl-amp (31). in addition, zn2⫹, but not ap4a, has been
shown to inhibit hint activity with an ic50 of (9.5 ⫾ 2.1) ␮m.4
therefore, we chose to test the effect of zn2⫹, ap4a, and other
nucleotides on the formation of hint-amp. as shown in fig. 7,
zn2⫹ (15 ␮m) inhibited hint-amp formation by 80%, and
ap4a inhibited hint-amp formation with an ic50 of 15 ␮m.
moreover, about 70 –90% inhibition was observed for incubations with 150 ␮m ap4a, ap3a, or atp. consistent with the
preference of  xxxg1225xxx  for atp and not gtp, incubations with
150 ␮m gtp decreased hint-amp by only 50%, whereas inhibition by either amp or gmp was not observed (supplemental

(0.022 ␮m) in buffer a containing lysine (2.2 ␮m) with [␣-32p]atp (0.35 ␮m) for 1
min. after the addition of echint (1.4 ␮m), aliquots were withdrawn at 1-min
intervals and quenched with sds sample buffer. the steady-state level of
hint-amp was maintained for 2 min, then the intensity was decreased from 3
to 8 min.

dependence of hint adenylation on the concentration of
echint and eclysu—to examine the concentration effect of
echint and eclysu on hint-amp intermediate formation, we
first fixed the eclysu concentration (0.025 ␮m) and varied the
concentration of echint from 0.05 to 12.5 ␮m. a plateau in the
amount of echint labeling was observed over the concentration
range 2.5–12.5 ␮m echint (fig. 8a). when the eclysu concentration was varied from 0.025 to 14 ␮m with a fixed echint
concentration (6.25 ␮m), the intensity of hint-amp was found
to increase with increasing amounts of eclysu (fig. 8b).
effect of inorganic pyrophosphate (ppi) on hint-amp
formation—yeast  xxxg1804xxx , which hydrolyzes ppi, has been used to enhance the catalytic activity of

of  xxxg1804xxx  to aminoacyl-trna synthetase
reaction mixtures has been suggested to more closely mimic the
in vivo conditions for aminoacylation (33, 34). therefore,
adenylation of echint was also carried out with and without

intensity for hhint1. labeling by hlysrs demonstrated a

that the hint c terminus is responsible for mediating the differential labeling observed by the eclysu and hlysrs.

discussion
aminoacyl-trna synthetases are essential enzymes that
charge amino acids with their corresponding cognate trnas to
form aminoacyl-trnas, which are a prerequisite for protein
biosynthesis. aminoacyl-trna synthetases synthesize aminoacyl-trna in a two-step reaction (35). in the first step, a carboxylate of an amino acid reacts with atp to form an activated
aminoacyl-amp intermediate. in the second step, a trna
reacts with the intermediate to form the aminoacyl-trna. in
addition to the aminoacylation reaction,  xxxg1225xxx

carried out in buffer a containing lysine (35 ␮m) and  xxxg1804xxx  (0.02 unit/␮l) with [␣-32p]atp (0.9 ␮m) at 23 °c for 1 min followed by

hlysrs (1 ␮m) (b). wt, wild type.

and several other aminoacyl-trna synthetases are known to
catalyze the formation of ap4a (36 –38).
in addition to their well recognized aminoacylation activity,
several aminoacyl-trna synthetases appear to have alternative
cellular and possibly physiological roles (39). for example, the
association of human  xxxg1225xxx  with the human immunodeficiency virus proteins vrp (40) and gag (41, 42) and the involvement of  xxxg1021xxx  and aspartyl-trna synthetase with pro-inflammatory cytokines (43) suggest that
aminoacyl-trna synthetases have multiple physiological functions. recently, hlysrs has been shown to suppress gene transcription in complexes with hhint1 and mitf (9) or usf2 (10).
dissociation of hhint1 from the complex by ap4a leads to an
observable increase of the transcription of specific genes. nevertheless, the ubiquitous presence of hints suggests that an
underlining and highly conserved physiological function is
likely to exist. although protein phosphoramidate adenylates

increases by ⬃2-fold in the presence of echint. taken together,
these results are consistent with formation of a covalent p-n
bond between the active site histidine and amp. as observed
for other hit proteins, such as  xxxg797xxx  and galactose-1-phosphate
uridylyltransferase (19, 48, 49), which also proceed through
active site histidine-amp intermediates, the catalytic mechanism used by hints proceeds through formation of an adenylated enzyme intermediate (fig. 10). the extent to which hint
hydrolysis of the aminoacyl-adenylate is dependent on proteinprotein transfer or the release of lysyl-amp from the active site
of  xxxg1225xxx  remains to be determined (fig. 11).
although e. coli and human hints are nearly 50% sequence
similar and their active sites consist of a conserved set of side
chains, the c termini of each enzyme is quite unique. x-ray
crystal structure analysis of the human and rabbit structures
has clearly demonstrated that the c termini of one monomer is
in close proximity to the active site of the opposite monomer
(21, 48, 50). consequently, we hypothesized that a chimeric
hint in which the c terminus of the human enzyme was
replaced by that the c terminus of the e. coli enzyme may be
responsible for substrate specificity differences. indeed, regardjournal of biological chemistry

such as adenylated dna ligase are well known, thus far they
have been shown not to be substrates for hints (4). because no
small molecule nucleoside phosphoramidates are known to
exist, we hypothesized that, based on the association of hhint1
with hlysrs, aminoacyl-adenylates may be natural substrates
for hints.
to investigate the relationship between  xxxg1225xxx  and hintamp formation, a series of experiments was carried out under
various conditions to verify the necessity for lysyl-amp formation. consistent with the preference of aminoacyl-trna synthetase for atp over gtp, labeling of hints was only observed
for incubations with [␣-32p]atp (fig. 2). in addition, gtp was
found to be a significantly poorer inhibitor of hint-amp formation than atp. in support of our findings, recent modeling
studies attempting to develop a molecular rationale for the substrate specificity of eclysu have concluded that the enzyme has
a greater propensity to bind atp in the necessary productive
conformation than gtp (44).
given the catalytic processes involving  xxxg1225xxx  (fig. 11), we
proposed that formation of hint-amp is dependent on the formation of lysyl-amp. as can be seen in figs. 2 and 5, increasing
the amount of lysine in the reaction solution resulted in enhanced
and saturable hint labeling, as expected from an enzymatic process. hint labeling was found to be dependent on mg2⫹, which is
required for aminoacyl-adenylate formation, whereas the addition
of zn2⫹, which favors ap4a formation, was found to be inhibitory.
in addition, our observation that ap4a and ap3a, which are neither substrates nor inhibitors of hints, are potent inhibitors of
hint-amp formation is consistent with the inhibitory effect of
zn2⫹ and the necessity of lysyl-amp for labeling. that we can
observe a plateau in the amount of labeling as we increase the
amount of echint is indicative of a substrate-saturable enzymatic reaction, with an apparent km of (0.85 ⫾ 0.34) ␮m, which
is about 25-fold lower than that observed for the cognate
trnalys (45).
the removal of ppi, a byproduct of aminoacyl-trna synthetase aminoacyl-adenylate formation, by pyrophosphatase has
been shown to significantly enhance trna aminoacylation
(34). because the binding site for both ppi and the incoming
trna are overlapping,  xxxg1804xxx  has been
shown to aid the reaction by reducing product inhibition and
the rate of the reverse reaction. similarly, a greater amount of
hint adenylation was observed with reaction mixtures containing  xxxg1804xxx .
previously, it has been proposed that hints, like other members of the hit family, carry out substrate hydrolysis by
employing nucleophilic catalysis (1, 46). of the four conserved
active site histidines, one has been shown to be catalytically
essential and presumably required for intermediate formation.
adenylated enzymes were not observed when the putative
nucleophilic histidine in either echint (his-101) or hhint1
(his-112, fig. 1) was mutated to alanine or glycine. chemical
degradation studies and pulse-chase experiments with cold
atp have demonstrated that the hint-adenylate is sensitive to
acid, but not base, and that the intermediate has a half-life of ⬍1
min. this result is consistent with kinetic experiments with
model adenosine phosphoramidate substrate that have
revealed the half-life of the echint-amp, hhint1-amp, chime-

less of the  xxxg1225xxx , the chimera was more effectively labeled than
either of the two parental hints. in particular, the bacterial c
terminus improved adenylation of hhint1 by eclysu by nearly
100-fold, with the chimeric protein appearing to be as effectively labeled as the echint by eclysu. surprisingly, hlysrs
more effectively labeled echint than hhint1. as can be seen in
fig. 9b, the e. coli c terminus appears to be at least partially
responsible for enhanced adenylate formation, since chimera
labeling is enhanced 47-fold. the additional 4-fold increase in
chimera labeling relative to echint may reflect additional
hhint1 specific determinants of adenylation or difference in the
half-life of the hint-amp intermediate.
taken together, these results demonstrate that the lysylamp is a physiological substrate for hints. in retrospect, the
ability of hints to hydrolyze aminoacyl-adenylates should not
be surprising given the similar structure and the greater reactivity when compared with nucleoside phosphoramidates.
given the broad conservation of hints in all three kingdoms of
life and their wide spread tissue distribution, a common evolutionarily conserved function appears likely. although it is possible that hints are cellular scavengers of inadvertently released
aminoacyl-adenylates, the results of recent e. coli protein-protein interaction studies demonstrating that elongation factor
(ef-tu) binds not only to lysyl, alanyl-, and isoleucyl-trna
synthetase but also echint suggests that the ability of hints to
hydrolyze aminoacyl-adenylates may possibly have a role to
play as regulators of protein translation (51). whether this role
may be to assist in pre-transfer editing or the regulation of
adenylate formation remains to be determined. in addition, in
mammalian cells, the adenylation of hint by  xxxg1225xxx  might be
responsible for the regulation of complex formation with the
transcription factors, usf2 and mitf. ongoing enzyme- and
cell-based studies should clarify their apparently necessary cellular role.
