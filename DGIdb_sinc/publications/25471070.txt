abstract
objective: to describe the effectiveness of  xxxd2693xxx  for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (oic) in
chronic non–cancer pain patients. data sources: citations in pubmed, google scholar, cochrane library, cinahl,
sciencedirect, and proquest were obtained. reference lists from individual articles obtained were reviewed for additional
sources. study selection and data extraction: all english-language publications available as poster presentations,
abstracts, and peer-reviewed articles ranging from preclinical to phase iii trials and published between 2007 and september
14, 2014, were reviewed and summarized. data synthesis:  xxxd2693xxx  was shown to be effective for increasing the
average weekly number of spontaneous bowel movements (sbms) in a single phase ii trial enrolling 208 patients. phase iii
trials (kodiac-04/-05) enrolling a total of 1352 patients developed a new primary end point with a more strict responder
criteria. this entailed a mean increase in sbms, at least 3 sbms per week, efficacy in 9 of 12 weeks, and efficacy in 3 of the
final 4 weeks of the study period. both groups receiving  xxxd2693xxx  25 mg had significant improvement over the placebo
group. the improvement was similar in patients who reported failure with laxatives in the past and regardless of daily
opioid dose. a long-term trial (kodiac-08) showed safety over 52 weeks. conclusion: oic affects many individuals
treated with opioids for chronic non–cancer pain. previous over-the-counter or prescription treatment options were
limited by a lack of adequate and well-controlled studies, multiple daily dosing, or need for injections. cost issues may limit
therapy with  xxxd2693xxx  to select patients.

introduction
opioids are commonly used analgesics for multiple disorders, including acute and chronic pain. in 2013, approximately 75 million patients filled an estimated 477 million
prescriptions for opioid analgesics.1 one of the most commonly reported adverse effects of opioids is opioid-induced
constipation (oic), characterized by a reduction in spontaneous bowel movements (sbms) after initiation of an opioid analgesic medication.2 this is attributed to the activation
of enteric mu-opioid receptors that lead to decreased gastric
motility as well as decreased gastrointestinal, biliary, and
pancreatic secretions. additionally, propulsion in the small
and large intestines is inhibited, whereas nonpropulsive
contractions are increased.3 oic is estimated to affect
between 35% and 95% of patients treated with opioids for
chronic non–cancer pain, although these numbers may be
skewed by self-reporting oic in patients with sufficient
weekly sbms from a clinician’s standpoint.2-4 patients will
often initially attempt to treat oic with over-the-counter
(otc) stool softeners, stimulant laxatives, or osmotic laxatives, but data supporting these therapies are anecdotal, and
patients often fail these practices; a meta-analysis was

attempted to compare docusate, sennosides, or lactulose
with  xxxd2982xxx  (peg), but there were insufficient
well-controlled trials to perform the meta-analysis.5 the
lack of controlled clinical trials may be because none of the
otc therapies specifically treat the cause of oic.3 this
article will review the use of  xxxd2693xxx  in the management
of oic.

pharmacology
 xxxd2693xxx  is a pegylated naloxone molecule that works as
an antagonist at primarily the mu-opioid receptor; pegylation
reduces passive permeability of  xxxd2693xxx  across the bloodbrain barrier and makes it a substrate for p-glycoprotein
( xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx ) transport.6,7 in preclinical models, permeability at
the blood-brain barrier was reduced 15-fold compared with
naloxone;  xxxd2693xxx  was found to attenuate the gastric peristaltic effects of morphine without a significant effect on
analgesia.6 morphine-induced miosis was used to evaluate
the ability of  xxxd2693xxx  to cross the blood-brain barrier.
healthy male volunteers were given morphine 5 mg/70 kg
intravenously along with oral  xxxd2693xxx  (8 to 1000 mg) or
placebo solution using a double-blind, cross-over design
with a 1-week washout period. no central antagonism of
pupil constriction was observed in 46 (95.8%) participants.
two participants had a possible attenuation; one received
 xxxd2693xxx  250 mg, and the other received  xxxd2693xxx  1000
mg along with the morphine dose.8,9

pharmacokinetics
 xxxd2693xxx  exposure after a single dose is dose dependent
from 8 to 1000 mg.8 single oral doses of 25 mg result in
time to maximum plasma concentration values from 1.5 to
2.0 hours and 1.4 hours with chronic dosing in patients with
oic.7,10,11 the apparent elimination half-life with single
doses ranges from 4 to 8 hours, but increases to 14.1 hours
with chronic dosing.8,10 with 28 days of repeated daily dosing, accumulation was not seen and is not expected.10 in
vitro studies show  xxxd2693xxx  to be metabolized only by
cytochrome p-450 (cyp)-3a4 and to be a weak inhibitor of
cyp2d6 and cyp2c19, which moderately affects the
pharmacokinetics of midazolam.12 the major metabolism
involves shortening of the peg chain or oxidation of the
peg moiety.7 plasma binding is low, with 80% to 100% of
 xxxd2693xxx  free in human plasma. glucuronidation is minimal with plasma concentrations of the glucuronide conjugate 100-fold less than  xxxd2693xxx . additionally, concomitant
administration of  xxxd2693xxx  and morphine did not affect the
glucuronidation of morphine.12 clinically significant drugdrug interactions occur with cyp3a4 inhibitors.12,13
 xxxd2693xxx  undergoes enterohepatic recycling, which
delays the time to peak plasma concentration in healthy
patients and those with mild hepatic impairment but not in
patients with moderate hepatic impairment.7 moderate and
severe renal impairment affect both the maximum plasma
concentration (cmax) and area under the plasma concentration–time curve (auc) of  xxxd2693xxx ; 2 patients with moderate and 2 patients with severe renal impairment had

excessively elevated total exposure (auc) and cmax values.
their aucs were between 2.0- and 2.7-fold higher than the
geometric mean of their respective groups, and their cmax values were between 1.5- and 3.0-fold higher than the geometric
mean of their respective groups. urinary excretion was
decreased in patients with severe renal impairment, and the
fraction excreted in the urine is approximately half of that
observed in participants with normal renal function. urinary
recovery in patients with moderate renal impairment is similar to recovery in those with normal renal function.14

clinical trials
phase ii trial
a phase ii, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
dose-escalation, multicenter, international trial was performed by webster et al.10 of the 267 patients screened, 208
were randomized, and 207 were included in the safety analysis. stratification was based on daily opioid dose, with 30
to 100 morphine equivalent units (meus) and >100 to 1000
meus as low-and high-dose groups, respectively. the
study consisted of a <10-day screening period, a 14-day
run-in period, a 7-day single-blind placebo phase, a 29-day
double-blind phase, and a 12- to 16-day follow-up period.
the primary end point was the change in sbms per week
from baseline to the end of week 1 of the double-blind
period. a modified intent-to-treat analysis (n = 185) of all
patients with baseline and end of week-1 data and who had
received at least 1 dose during the double-blind period was
used. the modified intent-to-treat population consisted of
62% women, with a mean age of 49.7 years, and 58% were
classified in the high daily opioid use group. patients were
randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive placebo or  xxxd2693xxx  5, 25,
or 50 mg during the 29-day double-blind period. bisacodyl
was allowed as a rescue medication if a sbm had not
occurred in a 72-hour period. the weekly increase in sbms
was greater both with  xxxd2693xxx  25 mg compared with placebo (2.9 vs 1.0; p = 0.002) and with  xxxd2693xxx  50 mg compared with placebo (3.3 vs 0.5; p = 0.0001) but not with
 xxxd2693xxx  5 mg. median time to laxation was better with the
2 higher doses of  xxxd2693xxx  but not with the  xxxd2693xxx  5-mg
dose. discontinuations were more frequent in the active
50-mg arm (11  xxxd2693xxx , 3 placebo) and were a result of
adverse reactions (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea/
vomiting, and abdominal pain); these adverse reactions
accounted for 7 of 11 discontinuations from 50 mg  xxxd2693xxx . three patients (2 placebo, 1  xxxd2693xxx ) discontinued
from the 5-mg cohort, and 3 patients (3  xxxd2693xxx ) discontinued from the 25-mg cohort.

kodiac-05) were reported by chey et al.15 inclusion criteria were 30 to 1000 meu/d for the treatment of chronic
non–cancer pain, fewer than 3 sbms per week, and at least
25% of sbms described as having one or more of the following: hard or lumpy stools, straining, or a sense of incomplete evacuation or anorectal obstruction. patients were
randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo,  xxxd2693xxx  12.5 mg, or
 xxxd2693xxx  25 mg once daily for 12 weeks. stratification was
by opioid dose (previously described low or high), with
enrollment designed to include at least 50% of laxative nonresponders (use of one or more laxative classes for a minimum of 4 days within 2 weeks of screening) in each group.
patients were not allowed to receive opioid antagonist,
mixed antagonist, or strong inhibitors of cyp3a4 or  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx .
the primary end point was the response rate during the
12-week treatment period. responders were defined as
patients with at least 3 sbms per week and an increase of at
least 1 sbm over baseline for at least 9 of the 12 weeks and
at least 3 of the 4 final study weeks. this end point was
designed to show a clinically relevant improvement and
durability of therapy over the entire trial. secondary end
points were the response rate in the subgroup considered
nonresponders to previous laxative use, increase in sbms
from baseline, improvement in constipation symptoms, and
reduction in rescue laxative use. if patients had no bowel
movement within 72 hours, they were allowed to use bisacodyl (10 to 15 mg, a maximum of 3 doses per episode) as a
rescue medication followed by one-time use of an enema, if
necessary. in kodiac-04, 652 patients were randomized,
and 524 (80%) completed the study. kodiac-05 randomized 700 patients, of whom 537 (76.7%) completed the
study. if the patients failed to record in their electronic diary
for at least 4 of 7 days during a week, they were classified
as not having a treatment response during those weeks. all
patients who discontinued from the study were classified as
nonresponders for the weeks after discontinuation. a higher
proportion of patients were responders in the  xxxd2693xxx 
25-mg group for both kodiac-04 (p = 0.001) and
kodiac-05 (p = 0.002) and for the 12.5-mg group in
kodiac-04 (p = 0.02);  xxxd2693xxx  12.5 mg did not meet
the primary end point in kodiac-05 (p = 0.20). a hierarchical statistical plan allowed for analysis of secondary end
points in all groups except for  xxxd2693xxx  12.5 mg in
kodiac-05. primary and key secondary end points are
summarized in table 1.

phase iii long-term safety trial
a 52-week, randomized, open-label, multicenter, safety and
tolerability extension trial (kodiac-08) was performed
after the pivotal efficacy trials.16 a total of 844 patients who
lived in the united states were recruited and randomized;
760 were new patients, and 84 were from the kodiac-04
or kodiac-05 studies. all patients were receiving a stable

maintenance opioid therapy at a dose of 30 to 1000 meu/d
for the treatment of chronic non–cancer pain. patients were
randomized 2:1 to receive either  xxxd2693xxx  25 mg or usual
care as prescribed by their physician. laxatives were not
allowed for patients assigned to the  xxxd2693xxx  group, but
bisacodyl was allowed as a rescue medication. the usual
care group could use any laxative, except  xxxd2614xxx 
or naloxone-containing products, and the laxative regimen
could be modified by the investigator throughout the study.
the study was completed by 327 patients (58.1%) in the
 xxxd2693xxx  group and 189 patients (67.3%) in the usual care
group. this was a safety extension study that showed no
new adverse events with  xxxd2693xxx  over a mean duration of
exposure of 268 days. use of breakthrough opioid medication was similar in both groups (36% with  xxxd2693xxx  and
34.8% with usual care). the study was not designed to show
efficacy, but a surrogate marker may be inferred by the sustained decrease in weekly rescue bisacodyl dose from 1.1
mg/wk from baseline to month 1 compared with 0 mg/wk
from month 1 to month 12. the usual care group did not
have a rescue medication because the dose of their laxatives
could be adjusted throughout the study.

dosage recommendations
the recommended dose of  xxxd2693xxx  is 25 mg once daily 1
hour before or 2 hours after a meal; the dose can be reduced
to 12.5 mg if patients are unable to tolerate 25 mg.13 patients

should be instructed to avoid grapefruit juice while taking
 xxxd2693xxx . the dose of  xxxd2693xxx  should be reduced to 12.5
mg, and more vigilant monitoring for adverse events should
be performed in patients with renal impairment (crcl < 60
ml/min) or concurrent administration of moderate cyp3a4
inhibitors (eg, verapamil, diltiazem, or erythromycin) and
patients not tolerating 25 mg.13 no dosage adjustment is
recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment
(child-pugh class a) or moderate hepatic impairment
(child-pugh class b).  xxxd2693xxx  use is not recommended in
patients with severe hepatic impairment.7,13

adverse effects
the most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea,
flatulence).13 a thorough qt/qtc study in healthy volunteers showed no significant changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, qt, pr, and qrs intervals with  xxxd2693xxx  25 mg
or  xxxd2693xxx  150 mg.11 increase in requirements of maintenance opioids was infrequent and similar across groups
receiving either placebo or  xxxd2693xxx ; additionally,
increased requirements of breakthrough opioids was also
similar between groups.17
 xxxd134xxx , another peripheral acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (pamora), is indicated for short-term use
to accelerate postoperative recovery of upper-and lowergastrointestinal tracts. trials with  xxxd134xxx  raised concerns of cardiovascular outcomes with all pamoras.18
the food and drug administration’s (fda’s) anesthetic
and analgesic drug products advisory committee recommended not requiring premarketing studies specifically
designed to address cardiovascular risks for all pamoras,
including  xxxd2693xxx , under development for the treatment
of oic, although postmarketing studies were recommended.19 regardless, composite cardiovascular outcomes (including cardiovascular death, myocardial
infarction, stroke, or congestive heart failure) were of special interest in kodiac-04, kodiac-05, and
kodiac-08. post hoc analysis showed that these populations had more than 66% of patients with at least 1 cardiovascular risk, and more than 40% had either a history of
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or at least 2 cardiovascular risk factors.15,16,20 four patients in kodiac-04/-05 (2
 xxxd2693xxx , 2 placebo) experienced myocardial infarctions.15 four patients in kodiac-08 (2  xxxd2693xxx , 2 placebo) experienced events adjudicated as major
cardiovascular events; one died from idiopathic generalized epilepsy, a second patient died in her sleep, a third
patient had an ischemic cerebral infarction and survived,
and the fourth had elevated troponin and survived.16 the
incidence of serious adverse events, including cardiovascular events or opioid withdrawal, were low.17

formulary considerations
 xxxd2693xxx  is the third drug approved specifically for oic.
 xxxd2513xxx  and  xxxd2614xxx , the first 2 are currently
available only as branded medications.21,22  xxxd2614xxx 
has recently been approved for oic in chronic non–cancer
pain.22 a summary of medications approved for oic is provided in table 2.
although fda reviewers found no abuse potential for
 xxxd2693xxx , it is classified as a schedule ii drug under the
controlled substance act because of its structural relationship to noroxymorphone; this was potentially because
analogues of schedule-ii controlled substances approved
for medical use are designated as schedule-ii products
under title 21 sections usc §802(32)(a) and §813.13,23-25
the manufacturer has submitted a descheduling request,
but the date of review has not been made public.23 as a
schedule-ii product,  xxxd2693xxx  will be heavily restricted,
although with the recent transition of hydrocodone-containing products to schedule-ii, chronic pain patients
using hydrocodone will be required to visit their prescriber
more regularly.26
other recommendations for the management of oic
include the use of bowel stimulants, stool softeners, and
peg. additional laxatives used include salines, suppositories, enemas, and lactulose.2,4,16 use of these otc agents is
based on anecdotal evidence, and many patients continue to
experience oic despite using one or more otc products in
combination with dietary modifications, increased fluids,
increased exercise, and fiber supplements.2,4,5 the phase iii
trials of  xxxd2693xxx  were designed to require robust improvement in oic, with a multifactorial end point rather than a
simple improvement in sbms per week.15  xxxd2513xxx 
approval was based on mean change in sbms per week, and
the most recent indication for  xxxd2614xxx  was based

on a proportion of patients with at least 3 sbms per week

summary
 xxxd2693xxx  was approved in the united states in september
of 2014 with the brand name  xxxd2693xxx . it is a pegylated
naloxone molecule with mu-opioid antagonist activity,
reduced central permeability, and oral bioavailability. trials
showed long-term safety and at least 12 weeks of effectiveness in patients with oic using a range of opioid doses
while including patients not previously responding to laxative use. rescue use of bisacodyl was allowed in all clinical
trials, but head-to-head comparisons with other treatment
options have not been performed. adverse events of special
interest that were monitored include major cardiovascular
events and opioid withdrawal; these were reported at similar rates across treatment groups.  xxxd2693xxx  is entering a
field dominated by otc and nonpharmacological products;
cost and current scheduling restrictions may limit treatment
to select patients.
