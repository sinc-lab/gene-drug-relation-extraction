abstract. the two [3h]aldosterone-binding proteins of rat
brain cytosol were characterized by a dextran-coated charcoal
method. with molybdate present to stabilize receptors, the affinities of the two sites for [3h] aldosterone in adrenalectomized
perfused rat brain cytosols were 0.28 and 18.0 nm at 4 c. high
affinity sites comprised 15% of the total receptor number. a
small contamination of perfused brain cytosol preparations with
corticosteroid-binding globulin (cbg) was found. however, due
to the very high affinity of cbg for corticosterone at 4 c, this
slight contamination resulted in significant alterations in the
apparent affinity of steroids competing for aldosterone-binding
sites. selective precipitation of cytosol receptors with 36%
(nh4)2so4 reduced cbg concentrations to negligible levels.
after blockade of low affinity sites with a highly selective glucocorticoid (ru 26988), the order of steroids in competing for
the high affinity receptor was desoxycorticosterone > fludrocor-

ldosterone is a steroid hormone synthesized
and released by the adrenal cortex. it is classified
as a mineralocorticoid (1) because of its well established
properties of enhancing sodium retention and potassium
excretion subsequent to occupation of receptors in the
collecting tubules of the kidney (2-4), salivary glands
(4), and gut (5). receptors for aldosterone have been
found in brain (6-8) and in blood vessels (9,10), although
the nature and function of these receptors is not as yet
clear. we have undertaken a detailed study of the [3h]
aldosterone binding sites of rat brain in order to help
establish the identity of these sites.
corticosteroid binding globulin [(cbg) transcortin],
is a serum glycoprotein found in all vertebrates which
binds corticosteroids, and especially corticosterone, with
very high affinity (11). cbg or a protein with a steroidbinding specificity similar to that of cbg (corticosterone
> desoxycorticosterone » aldosterone » dexamethasone) is reported to occur intracellularly in kidney (12,
13), pituitary (14, 15), human lymphocytes (16), and
muscle (17), as well as in liver (18), where it is synthesized and released into the blood stream. its function is
unknown, although hypothesized to serve as a transreceived july 6,1982.

tisone > corticosterone > aldosterone > progesterone > dexamethasone. readdition of a small quantity of dialyzed serum to
cytosol preparations yielded a profile of steroid binding similar
to that of the kidney  xxxg1602xxx  (aldosterone >
desoxycorticosterone > corticosterone). the distribution of both
receptors in brain regions of adrenalectomized rats was determined. both receptors were at greatest density in the hippocampus and lowest density in the hypothalamus. the high affinity
site was at greatest density in limbic regions, whereas the low
affinity receptor, apparently identical to the glucocorticoid type
ii receptor, was at greatest density in cortex and cerebellum. it
is concluded that the high affinity  xxxg1602xxx  of rat
brain, which had been identified in preliminary studies as a
 xxxg1602xxx , may bind either corticosterone or
aldosterone in vivo. (endocrinology 113: 2043,1983)

porter and storage site for glucocorticoids. we have taken
precautions to minimize distortions in binding due to the
presence of cbg, and report that the high affinity [3h]
 xxxg1602xxx  of rat brain has even greater affinity
for corticosterone, the endogenous glucocorticoid of the
rat.
materials and methods
cytosol and serum preparation
male sprague-dawley rats, weighing 120-150 g, were adrenalectomized under pentobarbitol anesthesia and maintained
on 0.9% nacl and free access to food for 3-11 days before use.
on the day of the experiment, animals were anesthetized with
50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbitol and perfused through the heart
with 50 ml cold 0.9% nacl. whole brains, excluding pituitaries
and olfactory bulbs, were rapidly removed to ice and homogenized in 4 vol ice-cold incubation buffer. this buffer (temm)
contained 20 mm tes, 1.5 mm naedta, 12 mm  xxxd2668xxx , and 10 mm  xxxd3216xxx , with ph brought to 7.4
at 4 c with naoh. for most experiments, the homogenate was
then centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 x g, and the supernatant
was used in binding assays at a final dilution of 8-15% (original
wet weight/volume). for the regional distribution experiments,
homogenates were centrifuged for 45 min at 30,000 x g. for
studies using (nh4)2so4, homogenates were centrifuged for 45
min at 30,000 x g, the surface layer of lipid was removed by

binding assays
cytosols in temm buffer were incubated with 3h-labeled
steroids, unlabeled steroids, and not more than 1% ethanol in
a final volume of 1 ml for approximately 20 h at 4 c. preliminary studies indicated that [3h]aldosterone binding was somewhat greater at 20 h than at 4 h and was stable for at least 25
h. incubation at 4 c yielded greater binding than did incubations at 25 or 37 c, during which binding began to decline after
4 and 1 h, respectively. assays were terminated by adding 0.1
ml cold dextran-coated charcoal solution (10% acid-washed
norit-a charcoal, 1% dextran, and 1% ovalbumin). after 5 min
on ice, tubes were centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 x g, and 0.7
ml of the resulting supernatant was assayed for tritium by
liquid scintillation spectrometry at a counting efficiency of 42%.
nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10"5 m
aldosterone. kidney cytosols were incubated at 4 c for only 4
h, since 20-h incubation caused a large reduction in binding,
presumably due to the greater abundance in kidney cytosol
preparations of proteolytic enzymes. for assays of [3h]corticosterone binding, nonspecific binding was determined in the
presence of 10~6 m corticosterone.
to measure binding in slices, brains from saline-perfused
adrenalectomized rats were removed to a cold petri dish and
minced with a razor blade. minced tissue was washed three
times by suspending and centrifuging in 10 vol ice-cold buffer
(137 mm nacl, 5.1 mm kc1, 6.6 mm na2hpo4, and 0.74 mm
cacl2, ph 7.4). slices were incubated in 2 ml buffer (~100 mg
tissue/tube) with [3h]aldosterone and unlabeled steroids. after
2 h of incubation at 4 c, 3 ml cold buffer were added per tube,
slices were centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 x g, and buffer was
removed by aspiration. this procedure was repeated twice more
to wash the slices. slices were then homogenized by sonication
in 0.5 ml 50% ethanol. radioactivity in 0.4 ml homogenate was
determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy, and protein
content was determined in an aliquot of the remaining solution
from each tube.
saturation isotherms were generated by varying the concentration of 3h-labeled steroid. binding constants were determined by the method of scatchard (19). the scatfit-59
program written by munson (20) was used to analyze biphasic
scatchard plots by the newton-gauss weighted nonlinear least

squares method. for calculations of bound to free ratios, this
program uses free concentrations derived by subtracting the
amount of ligand specifically bound (b) from the total amount
of ligand present. weights for the regression are set equal to 1/
b2. proteins were determined by the method of bradford (21),
using coomassie brilliant blue from bio-rad (richmond, ca)
and 7-globulin as protein standard.
materials
[3h]aldosterone (77.0 ci/mmol), [3h]corticosterone (105 ci/
mmol), [3h]dexamethasone (50.0 ci/mmol), [3h]desoxycorticosterone (46.8 ci/mmol), and [3h] xxxd3418xxx 
(37.1 ci/mmol) were all obtained from new england nuclear
corp. (boston, ma). before addition to the assay, solvents were
evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the 3h-labeled
steroids were redissolved in ethanol and buffer. the purity of
the [3h]corticosterone was measured by thin layer chromatography. a peak containing 95.5% of the [3h]corticosterone spotted on a kodak silica gel sheet (eastman kodak, rochester,
ny) migrated to an rf of 0.55 in a solvent system consisting of
chloroform-methanol-h2o (188:12:1). ru 26988 was a generous
gift of dr. d. philibert, roussel-uclaf (romainville, france).
other unlabeled steroids were purchased from sigma chemical
co. (st. louis, mo).

results
steroid binding to cbg
although cbg has been exceptionally well characterized (11), values for steroid affinities vary depending on
species and assay parameters, such as temperature and
ph, and the method used to measure binding. therefore,
we first examined the binding of 3h-labeled steroids to
rat serum under our assay conditions to be able to
recognize contamination of cytosol with cbg. binding
of [3h]corticosterone to rat serum proteins reaches equilibrium after 2 h of incubation at 4 c and is stable for at
least 17 h. an incubation period of 17-20 h was used.
very small amounts of serum bind enough [3h]corticosterone at 1 nm to alter its free concentration significantly. as little as 2 /a serum/ml assay binds over 60%
of the [3h]corticosterone present at a starting concentration of 1 nm (fig. 1).
saturation experiments with [3h]corticosterone concentrations varying from 0.1-5 nm were performed using
concentrations of dialyzed serum varying from 0.17-2 /xl
serum/ml assay. the resulting scatchard plots were curvilinear at higher serum concentrations, becoming linear
at the lowest serum concentration of 0.17 jul/ml assay.
at this concentration, a dissociation constant (kd) of
0.16 nm was obtained, with a b max of 525 pmol/ml serum.
the ability of adrenalectomized rat serum to bind
other steroids was determined. no specific binding of
[3h]aldosterone (10 nm) or [3h]dexamethasone (5 nm)
was measurable at a serum dilution of 5 /ul/ml. dexa-

pipette, and the supernatant was saved. cold temm buffer
saturated with (nh4)2so4 was added dropwise to reach a final
36% saturation. after 30 min on ice, the solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 4,500 rpm. the supernatant was discarded,
and the pellet was resuspended in temm.
for studies of binding to serum proteins, serum was obtained
by centrifugation of trunk blood or blood obtained by cardiac
puncture of pentobarbitol-anesthetized rats. serum was stored
frozen for up to 2 months before assay. where indicated, serum
was dialyzed overnight at 4 c against 2000 vol 20 mm tes
buffer n- tris [ hydroxymethy 1 ] methyl - 2 - aminoethanesulfonic
acid, ph 7.4. in preliminary studies, molybdate produced a
slight increase and  xxxd2668xxx  produced a slight decrease
in the maximum binding (bmax) of [3h]corticosterone to serum
proteins. both agents were excluded from the buffer, and 1 mg/
ml ovalbumin was added to the buffer in studies of serum
binding.

from adrenalectomized rats was incubated at concentrations ranging

corticosterone. values from two experiments varied by less than 10%.

methasone at concentrations as high as 10~ m produced
no apparent displacement of [3h]corticosterone binding
to serum. as found by many other laboratories, aldosterone is relatively weak at displacing [3h]corticosterone
from serum, having an ic50 greater than 10~7 m. these
experiments indicate that the binding of [3h]aldosterone
at nanomolar concentrations to rat brain cytosols does
not represent binding to cbg. due to the very high
affinity of cbg for corticosterone at 4 c, even small
amounts of contaminating serum (<1 /il/ml assay) bind
significant amounts of corticosterone and, to a lesser
extent, desoxycorticosterone.

blockade of low affinity binding. to determine accurately
the specificity of the high affnity [3h]aldosterone-binding site, it was necessary to block the binding of steroids
to the two other corticosteroid-binding sites present in
brain cytosols, the type ii receptor and cbg. calculations from the experimentally determined binding constants show that even at the low concentration of 0.5
nm, 46% of [3h]aldosterone binding is to the more prevalent low affinity sites. therefore, we used the procedure
reported by moguilewsky and raynaud (7) of blocking
low affinity binding with the highly specific glucocorticoid ru 26988. of the steroids that we tested on brain
cytosols, ru 26988 had the greatest selectivity for low
over high affinity sites (fig. 2). spironolactone had the
greatest selectivity for high us. low affinity sites. a similar selectivity was found for these two steroids in displacing [3h]aldosterone from rat kidney cytosols (fig.
2). competition curves for the low affinity receptor were
quite similar in brain and kidney. however, when high
affinity binding was measured, the brain had a greater

reported by anderson and fanestil (6) and indicate the
presence of two receptor populations or of negative cooperativity. the high affinity site [kd = 0.28 ± 0.12 nm;

asone does not alter the binding of [3h]corticosterone to
rat serum, although it totally displaces the specific binding of [3h]aldosterone to rat brain cytosols. binding of
[3h]corticosterone (2 nm) displaceable by 10~6 m dexamethasone was taken to represent binding to cytosol
receptors, while specific binding remaining in the presence of 10~6 m dexamethasone indicated binding to cbg.
with cytosol prepared from one adrenalectomized rat
that was killed by decapitation and not perfused with
saline, 87% of the specific [3h]corticosterone binding
was not displaceable by 10~6 m dexamethasone, indicating a large contamination by cbg. with perfused brain,
28% of the [3h]corticosterone binding was dexamethasone insensitive, indicating the presence of a smaller, yet
still significant, amount of cbg. to further reduce cbg
contamination, cytosol proteins from perfused rat brains
were precipitated with 36% saturated (nh4)2so4, as described in materials and methods, and resuspended in
fresh buffer. this concentration of (nh4)2so4 was chosen because cbg precipitates when (nh4)2so4 is added
at over 40% saturation (11). a similar procedure was
used by dekloet and mcewen (14) to remove cbg-like
binding proteins from pituitary cytosols. after
(nh4)2so4 precipitation, only 2-3% of specific [3h]corticosterone binding was not displaceable by 10~6 m dexamethasone. therefore, (nh4)2so4-precipitated cytosol
was used for all competition studies due to the near
elimination of contaminating cbg by this procedure.
stability of cytosol receptors after (nh4)2so4 precipitation. saturation experiments demonstrated that
(nh4)2so4 precipitation did not alter the affiity of the
high affinity receptor (kd = 0.17 ± 0.01 nm; n = 2) or
the susceptibility of the two receptors to selective blockade by ru 26988 and spironolactone (fig. 4). however,
it should be noted that saturation curves indicated a
higher apparent affinity for the low affinity site after
(nh4)2so4 precipitation [kd = 3.5 ± 1.1 nm (n = 2) after
(nh4)2so4; kd = 18.0 ± 2.5 nm for untreated cytosol (n
= 6)]. this may indicate that cbg in perfused cytosol
sequesters [3h]aldosterone at high concentrations (>10
nm), reducing the amount available to cytosol receptors.
the (nh4)2so4 procedure resulted in a 46% yield of high
affinity receptors and a 38% yield of low affinity receptors, as determined by scatchard analysis of saturation
curves. both receptors were increased in density (by 46%
and 22%, respectively) relative to protein concentration.
steroid specificity of cytosol receptors. the ability of several steroids to displace [3h]aldosterone from the high
affinity cytosol receptor was measured. cbg was removed by saline perfusion and (nh4)2so4 precipitation.
binding to low affinity receptors was blocked with 10~8
m ru 26988. a concentration of 0.5 nm [3h]aldosterone
was used. using the apparent binding constants obtained

apparent affinity than the kidney for aldosterone and
spironolactone (fig. 2). this may reflect real differences
in the high affinity receptors of these two tissues or
merely a greater proportion of high to low affinity receptors in brain than kidney.
saturation curves of [3h] aldosterone binding were run
in the presence of 10~8 m ru 26988 or 10"8 m spironolactone. spironolactone  xxxd1891xxx ~8 m blocked binding to the
high affinity site, while ru 26988  xxxd1891xxx "8 m greatly
reduced binding to the low affinity site (fig. 3).

aldosterone incorporation into brain slices. we measured
[3h]aldosterone binding to brain slices to determine if
the unusual steroid specificity of binding to cytosol proteins might be due to an alteration in receptors occurring
during tissue homogenization. since the presence of 10
mm molybdate did not alter [3h] aldosterone incorporation into brain slices in a preliminary experiment, molybdate was eliminated from the buffer for these experiments. a shorter incubation time (2 h at 4 c) was used
to prevent tissue degradation. brain slices were thoroughly washed with buffer before assay to reduce cbg
levels.
the order of steroids in competing for the incorporation of [3h]aldosterone (0.5 nm) into brain slices (table
3) was similar to the order seen for binding to cell-free
cytosol preparations. the percent inhibition of specific
[3h]aldosteroe incorporation into slices was highly correlated with the percent inhibition of high affinity binding to cytosol proteins (r = 0.839 for seven steroids).
regional distribution
the regional distribution in adrenalectomized rat
brain cytosol of the high and low affinity binding sites
was determined. the hippocampus contained far greater
levels of both high and low affinity receptors than any
other region (table 4). ouside of this one region, the
distribution of the two receptor populations was not

significantly correlated (r = 0.222 for 15 regions). the
high affinity site was found at greatest densities in the
limbic system, while outside of the hippocampus, the low
affinity site was found at highest 4e«sity4r the cerebral
cortex and cerebellum. the greatest ratio of high to low
affinity sites was in the hippocampus, while the lowest
was in the cerebellum.
binding of [3h]corticosterone to cbg-like binders was
determined in the same cytosol samples used for determining [3h]aldosterone binding. cytosols were frozen
first, which does not alter binding to cbg, and dexamethasone-insensitive [3h] corticosterone binding was
assayed at a concentration of 2 nm [3h]corticosterone.
cbg-like binding was found at greatest density in olfactory bulbs (59 fmol/mg protein), hypothalamus (54 fmol/
mg protein), and spinal cord (46 fmol/mg protein). the
brainstem areas, cerebellum, and striatum contained intermediate levels (28-36 fmol/mg protein) of cbg-like
binding sites. the hippocampus, amygdala, and all areas
of the cerebral cortex contained the lowest density (1621 fmol/mg protein) of cbg-like binders. these binding
sites may be either intracellular cbg-like proteins or
blood-borne cbg trapped in brain tissue and meninges.

discussion
[3h] aldosterone appears to bind to two populations of
receptors in brain (6, 7), kidney (1, 23), and vascular
smooth muscle (9,10). in the kidney, the higher affinity
binding site has been identified as a type i (mineralocorticoid) receptor, while the lower affinity site is the type

ably lower affinities.
the binding specificity of the low affinity site was
slightly different when measured with [3h] aldosterone
or [3h]triamcinolone. both assays were run in the presence of spironolactone to block binding to the high
affinity site. in both cases, the order of steroid potency
was triamcinolone > dexamethasone > aldosterone. the
addition of serum to the incubation greatly reduced the
competing potency of corticosterone, cortisol, and desoxycorticosterone.

brain aldosterone receptors

the order of potency of steroids in competing for the
high affinity receptor is notably different from the specificity of the  xxxg1602xxx  of kidney due to
the high potency of corticosterone and desoxycorticosterone in the brain. however, the addition of small
amounts of serum to brain cytosols causes a great reduction in the competitive potency of desoxycorticosterone
and corticosterone due to sequestration by cbg, yielding
steroid specificity identical to that of the kidney  xxxg1602xxx . the steroid specificity of the high
affinity site measured in cell-free cytosols is reflected by
the ability of steroids to compete for [3h] aldosterone
incorporation into brain slices. therefore, this specificity
was not produced artifactually by changes occurring during tissue homogenization.
it is important to note that the affinity and specificity
of the high affinity [3h]  xxxg1602xxx  of brain are
virtually identical to those recently reported for the high
affinity [3h]aldosterone-binding site of vascular smooth
muscle (9, 10). for the seven steroids assayed in both
the present study and by kornel et al. (10), a correlation
coefficient of 0.985 is obtained for potency relative to
aldosterone at the high affinity receptor of brain cytosol
vs. potency at the high affinity receptor of rabbit aorta
cytosol. lan et al. (28) recently reported a relatively high
affinity of corticosterone (74% that of aldosterone) for
type i [3h]aldosterone receptors of cultured rat pituitary
cells. in a separate study, lan et al. (29) reassessed the
binding of steroids to kidney cytosols and found that
cortisol, /?-methasone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone
have a greater affinity for the type 1 receptor than had
previously been appreciated. during the final preparation
of this manuscript, veldhuis et al. (30) reported that
corticosterone and desoxycorticosterone have a greater
affinity than aldosterone for the high affinity [3h] xxxg1602xxx  of rat hippocampal cytosol. krozowski
et al. (31) also recently found that corticosterone, desoxycorticosterone, and aldosterone have nearly equal affinities for rat hippocampal corticosteroid receptors in the
presence of ru 26988.
these studies raise the question of whether the  xxxg1602xxx  of the kidney is identical to the
high affinity [3h]aldosterone-binding site of brain and
vascular smooth muscle. the presence of cbg and intracellular cbg-like binders (type iii receptors) in all
previously published studies of kidney receptor specificity suggest that the affinities of desoxycorticosterone and
corticosterone for the type i site may be greater than
previously thought. preliminary attempts in this laboratory to obtain kidney cytosol receptors free of cbglike binding sites using (nh4)2so4 precipitation were
unsuccessful, possibly due to different properties of intracellular cbg-like proteins or the large quantities of
cbg present even in perfused kidney cytosol prepara-

ii (glucocorticoid)' receptor (1, 23). the identity of the
two aldosterone receptors in brain has not been clearly
established. in the present work, the affinities of the two
brain receptors for aldosterone (0.28 and 18.0 nm) are
higher than those previously (6) reported (1.5 and 63
nm). this is probably due to the use in the present study
of molybdate in the incubations.
molybdate stabilizes glucocorticoid receptors (24, 25),
preventing the effects of heating, of (nh4)2so4 precipitation at 4 c, and of exposure to high salt concentrations.
in the absence of molybdate, all three of these procedures
cause transformation of occupied receptors to the dnabinding state and inactivation of unoccupied receptors.
in the presence of molybdate, receptors are not affected
by these treatments. the mechanism of receptor stabilization by molybdate is not presently known. however,
molybdate has a similar stabilizing affect upon several
steroid hormone receptors, including those for aldosterone (26). since unoccupied receptors are more rapidly
degraded under various conditions, stabilization by molybdate may have a greater relative effect upon receptors
exposed to low rather than high 3h-labeled steroid concentrations, resulting in higher apparent affinities. using
adrenalectomized rat kidney cytosols, grekin and sider
(27) reported a 6-fold high affinity (0.5 nm at 20 c) of
[3h]aldosterone for the type i receptor as well as a 33%
increase in the b max (to 46.7 fmol/mg protein) when
molybdate was included in the incubation medium.
we obtained a kd for [3h]corticosterone binding to
dilute rat serum (1:6000 dilution) of 0.16 nm at 4 c. the
dissociation constant for corticosterone binding to cbg
at 4 c was previously reported to be 0.67 nm, as measured
by a dextran-coated charcoal method (22), and 2 nm
when measured by an equilibrium dialysis technique (11).
although the high affinity of dilute cbg for corticosterone at 4 c causes serious interferences in cytosol receptor
binding studies, these results do not reflect upon the
considerably lower affinity of cbg at physiological concentrations and 37 c.
precautions were taken in the present study to eliminate cbg from cytosol preparations by selective
(nh4)2so4 precipitation of cytosol receptors from perfused brain homogenates. contamination of samples by
even small amounts of serum results in the selective
binding to cbg of corticosterone, desoxycorticosterone,
and cortisol, thereby reducing their free concentrations
and abilities to compete with 3h-labeled steroids for
cytosol receptors. the highly specific glucocorticoid ru
26988 was used, as described by moguilewsky and raynaud (7), to block low affinity receptors. under these
conditions, less than 3% of specific [3h]corticosterone
binding is to cbg rather than cytosol receptors, and less
than 5% of [3h]aldosterone binding is to the low affinity
receptor.

tions. the high affinity of the  xxxg1602xxx  for
corticosterone emphasizes the importance demonstrated
by funder et al. (23) of serum cbg and possibly of
intracellular cbg-like proteins in preventing corticosterone from activating mineralocorticoid receptors. a
similar mechanism may be equally important in reducing
the ability of desoxycorticosterone to bind high affinity
aldosterone receptors, in light of the exceptionally high
affinity of desoxycorticosterone for this receptor.
autoradiographic localization after in vivo injections
of [3h]aldosterone (34, 35) or low concentrations of [3h]
corticosterone (36-38) in adrenalectomized rats yields
an almost identical regional distribution of radioactivity.
both steroids heavily label neuronal nuclei of the hippocampus, septum, and amygdala. the present work
shows these areas to have the greatest density of high
affinity aldosterone receptors, which, as previously discussed, can bind either corticosterone or aldosterone.
dekloet, mcewen and colleagues (14, 36, 39) have demonstrated the existence of two corticosterone-binding
receptors in rat brain in addition to a cbg-like binder.
we suggest that these two receptors are identical to the
two receptors measured by [3h]aldosterone binding.
in summary, we have determined the specificity of the
high affinity  xxxg1602xxx  of rat brain under
conditions that exclude steroid binding to cbg and low
affinity receptors. of the endogenous steroids, this site
has the greatest affinity for desoxycorticosterone, followed by corticosterone and then aldosterone. this receptor appears to be identical to the high affinity aldosterone receptors of vascular smooth muscle. in the
presence of small amounts of cbg, the steroid specificity
of the site, as determined by competition experiments,
appears to be similar to that of the mineralocorticoid
receptor of kidney. the endogenous steroid that activates
this receptor physiologically is not yet known and may
vary from tissue to tissue depending on the presence of
intracellular cbg-like binding proteins.
