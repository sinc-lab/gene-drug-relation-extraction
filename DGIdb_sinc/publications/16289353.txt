12 kda ligand devoid of neuroprotective properties and (3-3pyridyl)-1-propyl(2 s)-1-(3,3-dimethyl-1,2-dioxopentyl)-2-pyrrolidine carboxylate, a non-immunosuppressant ligand of fk506
binding protein 12 kda, exerteing neuroprotective effects.
conclusion: the beneficial effects of tacrolimus during in
vitro ischemia/reperfusion seem to indicate the restoration of

abstract—background: the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of the immunosuppressant tacrolimus, observed in vivo, remain unclear. here we quantify these effects
in vitro, and evaluate the potential involvement of the glutamate and/or immunophilin fk506 binding protein 12 kda in
tacrolimus-induced neuroprotection.
methods: primary cultures of neurons and astrocytes
from rat cerebral cortex were subjected to transient oxygenglucose deprivation. neuronal injury was evaluated by cell
counting after immunostaining experiments, lactate dehydrogenase release and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction. the involvement of the immunophilin fk506 binding protein 12 kda was explored using
an anti-fk506 binding protein 12 kda antibody, (3-3-pyridyl)-1propyl(2 s)-1-(3,3-dimethyl-1,2-dioxopentyl)-2-pyrrolidine carboxylate and rapamycin. extracellular glutamate and glutamate
uptake were respectively measured by high performance liquid chromatography and l-[3h]glutamate incorporation.
results: when added during either oxygen-glucose deprivation or reoxygenation, fk506 (50 –500 pm) offered significant neuroprotection. during oxygen-glucose deprivation, it
was able to reverse the oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced
increase in extracellular glutamate and decrease in glutamate
uptake and this effect was reversed in the presence of threo3-methyl glutamate, a specific inhibitor of glutamate transporter-1. blocking fk506 binding protein 12 kda inhibited the
neuroprotection induced by tacrolimus added during either
oxygen-glucose deprivation or reoxygenation. tacrolimusinduced neuroprotection was also reversed in the presence
of rapamycin, an immunosuppressant fk506 binding protein

the immunosuppressive compound tacrolimus (fk506) has
been reported to be a powerful neuroprotective agent in
animal models of cerebral ischemia in vivo (sharkey and
butcher, 1994; sharkey et al., 1996 and ide et al., 1996)
when injected before or after injury (for review, see macleod
et al., 2005). as an immunosuppressant, tacrolimus is
known to inhibit calcineurin-mediated t-cell activation by
forming a complex with the immunophilin fk506 binding
protein 12 kda ( xxxg798xxx ) (wiederrecht et al., 1992). during ischemia–reperfusion injuries, the involvement of
 xxxg798xxx  in tacrolimus-induced neuroprotection is still under debate (tanaka et al., 2002; gold et al., 1999 and
brecht et al., 2003) and other mechanisms have been
explored. either tacrolimus-mediated protection from free
radical-induced deterioration of mitochondrial function after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (nakai et al., 1997), or an
in vitro (kikuchi et al., 1998; dawson et al., 1993; toung et
al., 1999; butcher et al., 1997) antiexcitotoxic effect mediated
by the attenuation of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)-elicited/
no-related free radical production via inhibition of no synthase, has been suggested.
it is well known that a massive increase of extracellular
glutamate levels occurs during ischemia, which induces
excitotoxic neuron death mainly due to overstimulation of
nmda receptors (benveniste et al., 1984). under normal
conditions, the extracellular concentrations of glutamate
depend on degree of release into the synaptic cleft and of
uptake into cells by high affinity glutamate transporters
located both on neurons ( xxxg2102xxx ,
 xxxg2102xxx ) and glial cells (glutamate/aspartate transporter
(glast) and glutamate transporter-1 ( xxxg2103xxx )). the role of
glutamate uptake in the regulation of the extracellular glutamate concentrations during ischemia has recently been
re-assessed as an inhibition (jabaudon et al., 2000) and
even an inversion (rossi et al., 2000) of the transport
process, thus allowing the neurotransmitter to be released
from the nervous cells and astrocytes into the extracellular

space. extracellular glutamate level has not previously
been considered as a major determinant of the neuroprotective effect of tacrolimus on in vivo models of ischemia
(drake et al., 1996). however, a possible anti-excitotoxic
effect of fk506 based on the preservation of glutamate
uptake during ischemia has never been explored.
the aim of this study was first to quantify, on primary
mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes from rat cerebral
cortex subjected to transient oxygen-glucose deprivation
( xxxg791xxx ), the neuroprotection afforded by tacrolimus, added
either before injury or during reoxygenation. secondly, the
potential involvement of glutamate and  xxxg798xxx  in tacrolimus-induced neuroprotection was analyzed.

experimental procedures
the experimental protocols, involving animals and their care,
strictly conformed to the guidelines of the french agriculture and
forestry ministry (decree 87– 848). in all experiments attention
was paid to the regulations of local authorities for handling laboratory animals, the european communities council directive (86/
609/eec). particular efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.

preparation of cell cultures
mixed cortical neuronal– glial cell cultures were prepared from the
cortex of 18-days-old wistar rat fetuses. briefly, after removal of
meningeal, striatal, hippocampal tissues and olfactory bulbs, cerebral cortices were pooled and maintained in ice-cold phosphate
buffered saline solution (pbs; bio-whittaker, emerainville,
france) supplemented with glucose (33 mm). cells were mechanically dissociated from forebrains in dissociation medium by trituration through a fire polished 9-inch pasteur pipette. after centrifugation (400 r.p.m. for 10 min) the pellets were resuspended in
minimum essential medium with earle’s salts l-glutamine free
(mem; life technologie, invitrogen, cergy pontoise, france),
supplemented with glucose 15 mm (final concentration 20 mm),
calf serum 5%, horse serum 5% (sigma, lyon, france), penicillin
50 ui/ml and streptomycin 50 ␮g/ml. cells were plated to achieve
a confluent monolayer (105 cells/cm2) on plastic 12 or 24-well
culture plates (costar, vitaris, baar, france) previously coated
with poly-ornithine (10 ␮g/ml). cells were incubated at 37 °c in a
humidified 6% co2 and 94% air atmosphere. experiments were
performed after synaptogenesis, on mature cultures, in a serum
free-medium, at 13 days in vitro (div). cell types at div 13 were
analyzed by immunochemical staining and determined to be
51⫾8% neurons, 35⫾6% astrocytes and 14⫾8% undetermined
cells.

 xxxg791xxx  followed by reoxygenation
mixed cultures were exposed to a transient  xxxg791xxx  as described by
goldberg and choi (1993) with little modifications (velly et al.,
2003). cells were placed in a hypoxic chamber (po2 ⬍2 mm hg
by constant insertion of 94% n2 and 6% co2). culture medium
was exchanged two times with a glucose-free  xxxd2988xxx  (bss0–o2 in mm: nacl 116, kcl 5.4,  xxxd2534xxx  0.8, nah2po4
1.0, cacl2 1.8, nahco3 26.2, phenol red 0.025, sucrose 20)
bubbled with an anaerobic gas mix (95% n2, 5% co2) for 30 min
to remove residual oxygen. cells were incubated at 37 °c in this
solution for 80 min to produce  xxxg791xxx . this  xxxg791xxx  duration produced
injury selectively limited to neurons with no injury to the glial layer
(velly et al., 2003).  xxxg791xxx  was terminated by removing cultures
from the chamber, replacing the exposure solution with oxygenated mem (20 min bubbling with a 95% air, 5% co2 aerobic gas
mix) supplemented with 20 mm glucose and returning the multi-

wells to the incubator under normoxic conditions for 24 h. cells
submitted to  xxxg791xxx  and not treated with drugs were called control
cells. sham wash cell cultures, not submitted to  xxxg791xxx , were
placed in glucose  xxxd2988xxx  (bss20)⫹o2 (containing
20 mm glucose and aerated for 20 min with aerobic gas mix) for
80 min. then bss20⫹o2 was replaced by mem.

lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) release
neuronal injury was quantitatively assessed by measurement of
ldh release into bathing medium, immediately after  xxxg791xxx  and
24 h after reoxygenation, with cytotoxicity detection kit (ldh)
from roche diagnostic, meylan, france. this cytosolic enzyme is
released from damaged or destroyed cells and it has been established previously that ldh release correlates linearly with the
number of damaged or dying neurons after both excitotoxic and
apoptotic injuries. background ldh levels were determined in
sham wash sister cultures and subtracted from experimental values to yield the ldh activity specific to the experimental injury.
results obtained immediately after  xxxg791xxx  and 24 h after reoxygenation were pooled and expressed as percent of the maximal ldh
level corresponding to a near complete neuronal death without
glial cell death (⫽100%), determined by assaying sister cell cultures exposed to nmda (tocris) 300 ␮m and glycine 1 ␮m (tocris, zürich, switzerland) for a full 24 h.

3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (mtt) reduction test
neuronal viability was quantitatively evaluated by the reduction of
mtt (sigma) by the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase in
living cells. twenty-four hours after  xxxg791xxx , cultures were incubated
with mtt 5 mg/ml (v/v: 1/10) for 3 h at 37 °c. the formazan
product formed by the reduction of mtt was solubilized in hcl
0.08 n/isopropanol. cell viability corresponded to the value of the
optical density (od) read at 570 nm with background subtraction
at 630 nm. values obtained from cultures exposed to nmda and
glycine during the 24 h following the  xxxg791xxx  (100% neuronal death)
were subtracted to those measured in all experimental conditions.
results were expressed as percent of the od measured in sham
wash cells.
in order to determine the involvement of  xxxg798xxx  in the neuroprotection of tacrolimus, we also studied the effect of a mouse
monoclonal anti- xxxg798xxx  antibody (interchim, montluçon, france)
on the tacrolimus-induced inhibition of  xxxg791xxx -elicited mtt reduction. this antibody is directed toward the first 13 amino end
sequence of the human  xxxg798xxx  protein and does not cross-react
with the other members of the immunophilin family. for these
experiments, prior to adding tacrolimus (50 pm) and anti- xxxg798xxx 
antibody (50 nm) during  xxxg791xxx , cells were permeabilized by saponin (15 ␮g/ml for 10 min). negative controls were performed using
a purified mouse irrelevant igg1 (immunotech, marseille, france;
50 nm).

immunocytochemistry
assessment of the  xxxg791xxx -induced neuronal damage was also performed 24 h after the insult, by astrocytes and neurons immunochemical numeration, as described by velly et al. (2003). neurons
were labeled with mouse monoclonal anti-microtubule associated
protein ( xxxg1360xxx ; 1:500 dilution; roche diagnostics) and astrocytes with rabbit monoclonal anti- xxxg883xxx 
(gfap; 1:500 dilution; dako, glostrup, denmark). secondary antibodies were from molecular probes, invitrogen: alexa fluor 488
goat anti-rabbit igg (h⫹l) and alexa fluor 546 goat anti-mouse
igg (h⫹l). nuclear counterstaining was performed with 4=,6diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (dapi; sigma). the numeration was performed on three independent cultures and four
distinct fields. results were expressed as percent of the total

c. labrande et al. / neuroscience 137 (2006) 231–239
number of nuclei counterstained. the analysis was performed by
two observers who had no previous knowledge of the treatment
allocation.

measurement of extracellular glutamate
extracellular levels of glutamate in the culture supernatants submitted to  xxxg791xxx  were measured at the end of the  xxxg791xxx  by high
performance liquid chromatography (hplc) according to the technique described by geddes and wood (1984) with little modifications. an aliquot of 50 ␮l of culture supernatant was deproteinized
by 50 ␮l of 0.5 n perchloric acid, mixed and centrifuged (13,000
r.p.m. for 10 min) at 4 °c. the supernatant was then stored at
⫺80 °c until hplc analysis. all samples were analyzed for glutamate content using hplc along with a fluorometric detection
(scanning fluorescence detector 474; waters corporation, stquentin en-yvelines, france) after precolumn derivatization with
o-phtaldialdehyde. each sample was diluted 1/20 in a 0.15 m
sodium borate buffer and 10 ␮l of the dilution was directly injected
into a c-18 column (spherisorb, smi-labhut ltd., gloucestershire, uk 5 ␮m ods2 150⫻3 mm). the mobile phase consisted
of 0.1 m  xxxd2987xxx  (ph 5.8) in methanol (v/v; 1/7). elution
was performed with a methanol gradient ranging from 12.5–56%.
glutamate concentrations in the culture supernatants were calculated with reference to a standard mixture (program millenium 32,
waters corporation, version 3.05 software). results were expressed as percent of ␮m glutamate in sham wash cells.

uptake experiments
uptake experiments were performed at the end of the insult on
sham wash and control cells, untreated or treated with tacrolimus
(50 pm), which was added during the  xxxg791xxx . in experiments performed to test a potential direct effect of tacrolimus on basal
glutamate uptake, the compound was added on sham wash cells
80 min before uptake measurements. after the cells had been
washed twice with the uptake buffer (in mm: glucose 10, kcl 5,
nacl 127, cacl2 2.5,  xxxd2534xxx  0.2, nah2po4 1.3 and hepes 10;
ph 7.4), uptake assays were performed in accordance with our
previous description (lortet et al., 1999). briefly, the reaction was
started by adding l-[3h]glutamate (specific activity 15–25 ci/
mmol; nen, perkinelmer, courtaboeuf cedex, france)  xxxd1891xxx ⫺6 m
final concentration, diluted in the buffered physiological medium.
incubations were performed at 37 °c for 2 min. the reaction was
stopped by rapidly adding 1 ml of cold, sodium-free buffer, and
followed by two wash cycles with the same cold medium. to
dissolve the cells, naoh 1 n was added to the culture dishes and
the radioactivity was assessed by liquid scintillation counting at
least 12 h later. to determine the part of radioactivity not due to
sodium-dependent glutamate transport, l-[3h]glutamate uptake
was assessed in physiological medium in which sodium was
omitted and replaced by choline. glutamate transport was calculated as glutamate uptake in the presence of sodium minus glutamate uptake in the absence of sodium. protein content was
determined by the method developed by lowry et al. (1951) using
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard. to estimate the role of the
glial glutamate transporter  xxxg2103xxx  in the measured uptake rates,

233

some incubations were performed in the presence of threo-3methyl glutamate (3mg) a relatively specific inhibitor of this carrier
(armer, 2000), which was added (300 ␮m) at the time of the
uptake experiments. results (pmol glutamate/mg protein/min)
were expressed as percent of glutamate uptake rate in sham wash
cells.

drugs
tacrolimus (fujisawa, munich, germany, 0.5–500 pm), (3-3-pyridyl)-1-propyl(2 s)-1-(3,3-dimethyl-1,2-dioxopentyl)-2-pyrrolidine
carboxylate (gpi1046), a non-immunosuppressant ligand of
 xxxg798xxx  (guilford pharmaceuticals, bloomington, in usa,
100 pm), and rapamycin, an immunosuppressant  xxxg798xxx  ligand
devoid of neuroprotective properties (wyeth, louvain-la-neuve,
france, 500 nm) were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (final concentration ⬍0.1%). the vehicle control experiments were performed by using the same amounts of dimethylsulfoxide and
showed that the vehicle alone had no effect on the activities
measured on sham wash and control cells (data not shown).
dizocilpine, a non-competitive nmda receptor antagonist (mk801, tocris, 10 ␮m) used as the reference neuroprotectant
(huang et al., 2002) and 3mg were dissolved in water.

statistical analysis
each parameter investigated was analyzed statistically by one-way
anova followed by fisher’s test for multiple comparisons (statview
5.0; sas institute, grégy-sur-yerres, france). results are reported
as mean⫾standard deviation differences are considered significant
for p⬍0.05.

results
protective effects of tacrolimus against
 xxxg791xxx -induced neuronal injury
neuronal damage was first assessed by cell counting after
immunostaining experiments (table 1). compared with
sham wash,  xxxg791xxx  induced a significant decrease in the
neuronal count observed in controls 24 h after the injury
but did not affect the number of gfap/dapi positive cells
(underlying glial cells). this decrease was significantly
reversed by tacrolimus, mk-801 and gpi1046 but not by
rapamycin added during  xxxg791xxx .
ldh release and mtt reduction are closely correlated
with cell counting for quantification of neuron death. in fact,
24 h after  xxxg791xxx , 74⫾18% of the neurons had died, as shown
by ldh release (fig. 1) and 21⫾13% remained viable, as
evaluated by mtt reduction (data not shown). tacrolimus,
added during either  xxxg791xxx  (fig. 1a) or during reoxygenation
(fig. 1b), elicited a potent and dose-dependent neuroprotective effect, as shown by a significant reversal of the
 xxxg791xxx -induced increase in ldh release and decrease in

 xxxg791xxx  80 min
fig. 2. after 80 min of  xxxg791xxx , tacrolimus counteracted the  xxxg791xxx -induced increase in extracellular glutamate. extracellular levels of glutamate in the
culture supernatants were estimated at the end of the  xxxg791xxx  period by hplc analysis along with a fluorometric detection. at the end of the 80 min  xxxg791xxx 
exposure, glutamate extracellular levels were significantly increased compared with those measured in sham wash cells. tacrolimus 50 pm added in
sham wash cells, did not modify the glutamate extracellular levels but, when added during the injury (0.5–500 pm), dose-dependently counteracted
the  xxxg791xxx -induced elevation of glutamate concentration. * p⬍0.05 vs. control (n⫽5 cultures per condition pooled from four experiments).

involvement of glutamate in tacrolimus-induced
neuroprotection
after 80 min of  xxxg791xxx , extracellular glutamate levels were
significantly increased compared with sham wash (fig. 2).
tacrolimus, which did not modify the glutamate level in
sham wash, counteracted the  xxxg791xxx -induced elevation of
glutamate levels when it was added during the injury.
moreover, it decreased the extracellular glutamate level to
sham wash levels (0.83⫾0.20 ␮m).
after 80 min of  xxxg791xxx , the glutamate transport activity
of controls presented a 53⫾9% impairment compared
with sham wash (fig. 3a). tacrolimus did not exhibit
any effect on basal glutamate uptake rate measured in
sham wash. however, when added during the injury, it
counteracted the  xxxg791xxx -induced decrease in glutamate
transport (percent sham wash;  xxxg791xxx ⫹fk506: 82⫾11%).
to clarify the involvement of  xxxg2103xxx  in the uptake activity
measured with or without tacrolimus, experiments were
performed in the presence of 3mg, which preferentially inhibits this carrier (fig. 3b). 3mg induced a
33⫾7% decrease in uptake rate measured in sham
wash but did not further affect this activity after  xxxg791xxx 
(percent sham wash;  xxxg791xxx : 54⫾13%;  xxxg791xxx ⫹3mg:
63⫾2%). moreover, the protective effect of a preventive
treatment with tacrolimus on the glutamate uptake rate
measured in  xxxg791xxx  cells was reversed in the presence
of 3mg (percent sham wash;  xxxg791xxx ⫹fk506: 88⫾16%;
 xxxg791xxx ⫹fk506⫹3mg: 52⫾4%). twenty-four hours after
 xxxg791xxx , the glutamate transport activity in controls,
and in cells treated with tacrolimus added during  xxxg791xxx 
or during reoxygenation, was not significantly different
from the sham wash uptake rate (percent sham

wash;  xxxg791xxx : 88⫾9%; tacrolimus added during  xxxg791xxx :
97⫾18%; tacrolimus added during reoxygenation:
99⫾7%).
role of  xxxg798xxx  in the tacrolimus-induced
neuroprotection
twenty-four hours after  xxxg791xxx , the monoclonal anti- xxxg798xxx 
antibody and rapamycin cancelled the neuroprotective effect
of tacrolimus added during the injury or during reoxygenation,
as shown by the mtt reduction rate (fig. 4). the antifkbp12 antibody and rapamycin alone were unable to protect neuronal cells from  xxxg791xxx  as shown by mmt test (percent
sham wash;  xxxg791xxx : 22⫾21%; odg⫹anti- xxxg798xxx : 30⫾16%;
 xxxg791xxx ⫹rapamycin: 27⫾11%) and combining either tacrolimus
and the anti- xxxg798xxx  antibody, or tacrolimus and rapamycin,
did not modify the mtt reduction rate in sham wash. the
permeabilizing agent saponin did not modify mtt reduction
in sham wash and did not interfere with the protective effect
of tacrolimus (percent sham wash; sham wash⫹saponin:
81⫾9%;  xxxg791xxx ⫹fk506⫹saponin: 82⫾13%). purified mouse
irrelevant igg1 antibody, used as negative control, did not
abolish the neuroprotective effect of tacrolimus (percent of

discussion
using a transient  xxxg791xxx  on primary mixed cultures of
neurons and astrocytes, we show that tacrolimus reverses  xxxg791xxx -induced neuron death when assessed 24 h
after the injury. this protective effect is observed when
tacrolimus was added either during  xxxg791xxx  or during
reoxygenation. both of these beneficial effects can prob-

ably be explained by the binding of tacrolimus to
 xxxg798xxx . moreover, the effect of tacrolimus added during  xxxg791xxx  may be mediated, at least in part, by the fact
that it reverses the  xxxg791xxx -induced rise in extracellular
glutamate levels and decrease in glutamate uptake. finally, our results also indicate that tacrolimus protects a
 xxxg2103xxx -dependent transport mechanism.

fig. 4. role of fkpb12 in the neuroprotective effect of tacrolimus. either the anti- xxxg798xxx  antibody or rapamycin was combined with tacrolimus and
introduced either during  xxxg791xxx  or during reoxygenation. before adding the combination of anti- xxxg798xxx  and tacrolimus during  xxxg791xxx , cells were
permeabilized by saponin. both the anti- xxxg798xxx  antibody and rapamycin totally inhibited tacrolimus’s ability to protect against mtt reduction caused
by  xxxg791xxx . gpi1046 added either at the start of  xxxg791xxx  or during reoxygenation protected neurons from  xxxg791xxx , as shown by the inhibition of the
 xxxg791xxx -induced decrease in mtt reduction. * p⬍0.05 vs. control (n⫽4 cultures per condition pooled from four experiments).

the tacrolimus concentrations used (5–500 pm) were
less than the residual levels measured in the blood of transplanted patients (ueda et al., 1995) but were close to those
reported in the in vitro experiments of gold et al. (1999), who
demonstrated a tacrolimus-induced neurotrophic effect.
we found that tacrolimus, added either during  xxxg791xxx  or
during reoxygenation, exhibited a neuroprotective effect.
this is in good agreement with studies indicating that the
compound can exert protective effects in animal stroke
models when applied up to 2 h following injury (furuichi et
al., 2003 and arii et al., 2001). we observed that the
neuroprotection afforded by tacrolimus added during the
injury was due, at least in part, to its antiexcitotoxic effect.
the protective effect of tacrolimus against ischemic injury
was comparable to that of mk-801 used as a reference
compound against excitotoxic neuron loss (huang et al.,
2002). however, unlike tacrolimus, mk-801 exhibited a
neuroprotective effect only when the drug was added during  xxxg791xxx . this could be explained by the fact that excitotoxic mechanisms, and especially nmda receptor activa-

tion, were active mainly during  xxxg791xxx . the effect of tacrolimus on nmda-mediated toxicity is still under debate.
indeed, several in vitro studies have reported that tacrolimus, at high concentrations (500 nm), induces an attenuation of nmda-elicited/no-related free radical production
via inhibition of no synthase (kikuchi et al., 1998 and
dawson et al., 1993), while others have found evidence
refuting an antiexcitotoxic effect of tacrolimus in vivo
(toung et al., 1999 and butcher et al., 1997). other indirect
antiexcitotoxic mechanisms could be involved in the neuroprotective effects of tacrolimus during ischemia, such as
the inhibition of the accumulation of extracellular glutamate. glutamate accumulation in the extracellular space
after in vivo or in vitro experimental ischemia is now a
generally accepted phenomenon (lipton, 1999), depending on excessive release (benveniste et al., 1984) coupled
with a decreased (jabaudon et al., 2000) or reversed
(rossi et al., 2000) glutamate uptake process by high
affinity glutamate transporters located on both neurons
( xxxg2102xxx ) and glial cells (glast and  xxxg2103xxx ).

c. labrande et al. / neuroscience 137 (2006) 231–239

at the end of the injury, we also described an ogdinduced increase in extracellular glutamate levels. while
the  xxxg791xxx -induced increase in extracellular glutamate levels was observed to be counteracted by tacrolimus, this
was probably not due to direct inhibition of glutamate release, since tacrolimus had no effect on ischemia-induced
synaptic overflow of glutamate in vivo (drake et al., 1996).
the maintenance of non-excitotoxic glutamate levels during  xxxg791xxx  in the presence of tacrolimus can more likely be
explained by the preservation of glutamate transport. we
show here for the first time that, when added during the
injury, tacrolimus curtailed the  xxxg791xxx -induced inhibition of
glutamate uptake. this protective effect of tacrolimus on
glutamate transport may be due to antioxidant properties.
indeed, reactive oxygen species formed during  xxxg791xxx  and
reoxygenation may induce an inhibition of glutamate uptake by oxidation of the sulfhydryl groups of the glutamate
carriers (trotti et al., 1998). tacrolimus alone did not scavenge free radicals and therefore had no antioxidant properties. however, it has been shown to increase cellular
glutathione content and to protect neuronal cell lines
against h2o2 toxicity (tanaka et al., 2001, 2002). it downregulated free radical tissue levels after liver ischemia
(garcia-criado et al., 1997) and inhibited, although only in
vitro, no synthase activity (dawson et al., 1993). finally,
tacrolimus was shown to down-regulate reactive oxygen
species generation by mitochondrial complex iii (zini et al.,
1998). similarly, in our in vitro model, tacrolimus may
indirectly limit the  xxxg791xxx -induced impairment of glutamate
uptake via inhibition of reactive oxygen species formation.
whatever the mechanism involved in the tacrolimusmediated protection of glutamate transporters during  xxxg791xxx ,
the transport activity measured in cells treated by this drug
seems to reflect a  xxxg2103xxx -dependent process since 3mg, a
not fully specific  xxxg2103xxx  inhibitor, reversed the tacrolimusinduced preservation of glutamate uptake during ischemia.
however, 3mg was able to dramatically reduce the uptake
rate of the sham wash, indicating that the glutamate transport process in our normoxic experimental conditions relied largely on  xxxg2103xxx . however, 3mg did not further decrease glutamate transport during  xxxg791xxx , suggesting that
 xxxg2103xxx -mediated glutamate uptake was totally inhibited by
ischemic conditions. similar findings have been reported
during ischemia on hippocampal slices in the presence of
dihydrokainate, also considered a specific  xxxg2103xxx  blocker
(roettger and lipton, 1996).
in addition to this antiexcitotoxic effect afforded during
 xxxg791xxx , tacrolimus was able to protect neuronal cells when
added during reoxygenation. we demonstrate that the
 xxxg798xxx  immunophilin seems to be required for the tacrolimus-induced neuroprotective effects during and after  xxxg791xxx .
this suggests that  xxxg798xxx  could be the first step in the
overall neuroprotective effects of tacrolimus, even including
its antiexcitotoxic effects. this hypothesis is strongly supported by the fact that the anti- xxxg798xxx  antibody totally inhibited these effects. further indirect proof is provided by the
reversal of the tacrolimus-induced neuroprotection by an immunosuppressant  xxxg798xxx  ligand devoid of neuroprotective
properties, rapamycin, which presumably acts as an fk506

antagonist at  xxxg798xxx  (dawson et al., 1993). moreover, in
our experimental model, gpi1046, a non-immunosuppressant ligand of  xxxg798xxx , exerted neuroprotective effects
which agree well with its antioxidant properties on h2o2treated sh-sy5y cell lines (tanaka et al., 2002). however,
in this study (tanaka et al., 2002), tacrolimus and gpi1046induced protection was also observed on cells which did
not express  xxxg798xxx , suggesting that these neuroprotective effects could be mediated by fkbps other than
 xxxg798xxx , as shown for tacrolimus’s neurotrophic effects
(gold et al., 1999). finally, a more recent study (brecht et al.,
2003) has suggested that the tacrolimus-induced neuroprotection in the ischemic rat brain is related to tacrolimusinduced changes in the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase
activity of immunophilins, including  xxxg798xxx . another hypothesis could be that fk506 mediates neuroprotection via stress
kinases (klettner and herdegen, 2003) which have been
reported to protect against glutamate excitotoxicity (rordorf
et al., 1991).

conclusion
in conclusion, this study demonstrates a neuroprotective
effect of tacrolimus in an in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion. this protective effect was observed both when
tacrolimus was added at the time of injury and when added
during reoxygenation. both of these beneficial effects of
tacrolimus on neuronal viability may involve the  xxxg798xxx 
pathway and its preventive action may be mediated, at
least in part, by a restoration of the  xxxg2103xxx -mediated activity
which is dramatically impaired by  xxxg791xxx , thus allowing extracellular glutamate levels to be maintained below excitotoxic concentrations. further research is needed to precisely define the mechanism through which tacrolimus acts
on glutamate transport: by increase in the membrane fraction of the transporters or by increase in the affinity of the
transporters for glutamate.
