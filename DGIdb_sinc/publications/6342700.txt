an ester derivative of  xxxd189xxx , is a new non-narcotic analgesic,
which also has some anti-inflammatory properties. pharmacological studies have
demonstrated analgesic activity in the parent molecule and in both its acid and alcohol
metabolites, whereas the anti-inflammatory activity appears to be more specifically
associated with the acid metabolite (1, 2). preliminary in vivo and in vitro studies have
indicated that the drug is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor.

controlled studies in man have confirmed the analgesic activity of  xxxd193xxx  after a
single dose of 300 mg (3). at repeated doses of 300 mg three times a day,  xxxd193xxx  is
generally well tolerated and has remarkably good gastric tolerability: a study of faecal
blood loss, using 31cr, has shown that  xxxd193xxx  at 450 mg/day and 900 mg/day causes
no greater gastric bleeding than placebo and significantly less than aspirin at 1.8 g/day (4).
kinetic studies in humans indicate that peak plasma levels with  xxxd193xxx  are
obtained two hours after dosing and elimination is bi-exponential (alpha half-life 1.2 h; beta
half-life 43 h). the main acid metabolite shows peak plasma levels at 1.2 h (alpha half-life
1.1 h; beta half-life 13.4 h). following repeated dosing, there is no accumulation of drug or
metabolites in the body (5, 6). a three-times-daily regimen has generally been found satisfactory for chronic treatment.

summary
 xxxd193xxx  is a new non-narcotic analgesic. in a double-blind, cross-over study the efficacy of
 xxxd193xxx  at doses of 450 mg/day and 900 mg/day was compared to naproxen 750 mg/day and
placebo in patients with osteoarthritis. each drug treatment was given for two weeks, the total duration of the study being eight consecutive weeks.
 xxxd193xxx , at either dose, was effective in relieving pain associated with osteoarthritis; the
efficacy was comparable to naproxen. there was no definite indication that 900 mg/day was more
effective than 450 mg/day.
 xxxd193xxx , at both dosage levels, was well tolerated. any noted side-effects were mild. there
was a total of 12 side-effects in nine patients with the high dose,fiveside-effects infivepatients with
the low dose, compared with 11 side-effects in nine patients with naproxen and 10 side-effects in
seven patients with placebo.

the purpose of this study was to carry out an investigation into the analgesic efficacy
of the compound and to evaluate a therapeutic dose in osteoarthritis.
materials and methods

patient selection
twenty-four out-patients, of either sex, with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee,
confirmed by radiography, were chosen for the study. patients with any rheumatoid disorders, gout, a history of gastric ulcers, or with hepatic, renal or cardiac insufficiency were
excluded. other exclusion criteria were: history of epilepsy, alcoholism, drug dependency,
mental retardation, pregnancy, or females of child-bearing age. the purpose of this study
was fully explained to each selected patient and written consent to take part was obtained.
assessments
efficacy assessments were carried out using pain analogue scales for pain on movement, at rest and in the most painful joint. duration of morning stiffness and paracetamol
consumption after each treatment period were also assessed. a plasma sample was taken
initially and after each treatment period to verify compliance and determine plasma levels
after each drug treatment.
after each treatment period, patients were asked by means of a simple, non-leading
question, if they noticed any unwanted effects, and at the end of the study patients were
asked to estimate the treatment they found to be most satisfactory.
statistical analysis
the results were assessed using friedman's two-factor analysis of variance. if the
analysis of variance indicated a significant difference between drug treatments, the treatments were compared by wilcoxon matched pair signed rank test.
demographic data
twenty-four patients were admitted and 18 of these completed the study. demographic data are shown in table i.

withdrawals
six patients were withdrawn before completing the study. three patients withdrew

study design
the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd193xxx  was evaluated in comparison with placebo
and naproxen using a double-blind cross-over design. all patients received each drug for
14 days; the sequence of drug administration was randomized according to a latin square
design.  xxxd193xxx  was given to all patients in doses of 150 mg t.d.s. and 300 mg t.d.s.
naproxen was given at a dose of 750 mg/day (250 mg mane and 500 mg nocte). all four
treatments were administered using tablets of identical appearance with the same number
of doses per day. a bioavailability study, carried out separately, using the formulations
employed in this study produced plasma levels similar to the commercially available
formulations and indicated bioequivalence.
the total duration of the study was eight weeks. for ethical reasons a 'wash-out'
period was not included in the design. however, patients were asked to discontinue any
analgesic or anti-inflammatory drug therapy on the day prior to commencement of the
study. throughout the study patients were allowed paracetamol, up to 4 g/day, as a
'rescue' analgesic. no other anti-inflammatory or analgesic drug therapy was permitted.

results
the results of friedman's analysis of variance are summarized in table ii. the rank
sums, friedman's test statistic and its probability value are given for all pain scores. comparing the treatments within each pain score, a lower sum indicates less pain than a higher
sum. the 'most painful joint' scale failed to show an overall significant difference between
the treatments. for the remaining three analyses no difference between placebo and initial
score was observed. the differences between treatments are reported for each score
separately below.
pain on movement
 xxxd193xxx  at both dosage levels and naproxen were superior to placebo (p < 0.05)
and there was no significant difference between the  xxxd193xxx  and naproxen effect.
pain at rest
the high-dose  xxxd193xxx  (900 mg/day) and naproxen were superior to placebo
(p < 0.05), while the difference between  xxxd193xxx  450 mg/day and placebo did not reach

while taking placebo, for personal reasons unrelated to the drug therapy, and one patient
withdrew while taking  xxxd193xxx  450 mg/day when she developed influenza. a further
patient withdrew after six weeks as she was hospitalized for hip surgery and another withdrew after four weeks, while taking naproxen, complaining of nausea and headache. this
patient had already taken  xxxd193xxx  900 mg/day and placebo. it was considered unlikely
that these effects were drug-related.

statistical significance (p = 0.11). there was no significant difference between naproxen
and  xxxd193xxx  900 mg/day but naproxen was superior to the low-dose  xxxd193xxx 
(p < 0.05). the high dose of  xxxd193xxx  reduced pain at rest more than the low dose
although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08).

duration of morning stiffness
the results suggest a reduction in morning stiffness after treatment with  xxxd193xxx 
450 mg, but this was not confirmed by statistical analysis (table iii).

returned paracetamol count
there was no significant difference in the number of paracetamol tablets taken in each
treatment period.
patient preference
at the end of the study patients were asked to state which treatment period they
considered to have been the most beneficial in reducing the painful symptoms of their
disease. seven patients preferred  xxxd193xxx  900 mg, four naproxen, and four  xxxd193xxx 
450 mg. three patients indicated no preference. there was no significant difference in the
preference for each different treatment (x2 test).
side-effects
the side-effects are summarized in table iv. with the exception of one patient, who
was mentioned under 'patient withdrawals', all side-effects were mild and did not interfere
with the conduct of the study.

overall pain
the analysis was repeated combining the three analogue scores, pain at rest, on
movement and associated with most painful joint. a significant reduction in pain compared with placebo was confirmed for naproxen and both doses of  xxxd193xxx . for the
overall pain score there was no difference between the  xxxd193xxx  and naproxen effect.

patients who completed the study and it was considered that these patients followed their
instructions very carefully and the number of departures from the protocol was very small.
satisfactory patient compliance was further emphasized by the plasma-level data (table

 xxxd193xxx  at 450 mg/day and 900 mg/day was effective in reducing pain associated
with osteoarthritis.  xxxd193xxx  900 mg/day and naproxen 750 mg/day gave similar results
in the statistical analysis of all the pain indices used in the study. however, in one index
only, pain at rest, was there a tendency to indicate that the higher dose of  xxxd193xxx  is
superior to the lower dose. it is therefore possible that the benefits obtained from the higher
dose may be marginal in certain patients, although it should be remembered that more
patients stated a preference for  xxxd193xxx  900 mg/day. it would appear from these results

discussion
in view of the previously reported analgesic properties of  xxxd193xxx  (3), it was
considered reasonable to conduct an evaluation of this drug in osteoarthritis and compare
its effect with naproxen and placebo.
naproxen 750 mg/day provided significant pain relief in accordance with past
experience (7). plasma levels after naproxen and  xxxd193xxx  were consistent with previous
results (5, 8), thus supporting the validity of the assessment procedures and compliance of
the patients.

that higher doses should be kept for patients with severe pain who respond well to treatment with this drug.
neither  xxxd193xxx  nor naproxen was superior to placebo in the relief of morning
stiffness, as this is perhaps an unreliable measure in osteoarthritis, being more meaningful
in rheumatoid disease. there was also no improvement in pain associated with the patients'
most severely affected joint after either of the active drugs; this again may be expected
after only two weeks of treatment.
none of the secondary effects recorded was severe. five patients reported side-effects
after the low dose of  xxxd193xxx , compared to nine patients after the high dose, nine
patients after naproxen and seven patients after the placebo treatment period. this
suggests that the new analgesic may be used with safety in daily doses up to 900 mg. there
were slightly more side-effects reported after the higher dose than the low dose. this
indicates that until further tolerability data are available, doses of 900 mg/day should only
be used when necessary, after confirming that the drug is well tolerated at lower doses.
it is concluded that  xxxd193xxx  at doses of 450 to 900 mg per day provides significant
pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis. the drug at these doses can be used with safety.
the higher 900 mg dose provided a therapeutic index comparable to naproxen 750
mg/day. as analgesic activity was confirmed with the lower 450 mg dose, higher doses
should only be used when necessary in patients where the drug is well tolerated.
