abstract  xxxd1944xxx  is currently used for the treatment of
paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (af). pharmacological inhibition of cardiac two-pore-domain potassium
(k2p) channels results in action potential prolongation and
has recently been proposed as novel antiarrhythmic strategy.
we hypothesized that blockade of human k2p channels contributes to the electrophysiological efficacy of  xxxd1944xxx  in
af. two-electrode voltage clamp and whole-cell patch clamp
electrophysiology was used to record k2p currents from xenopus oocytes and chinese hamster ovary cells. all functional
human k2p channels were screened for  xxxd1944xxx  sensitivity, revealing significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of cardiac  xxxg1256xxx  ( xxxg1256xxx ; ic50 026.7 mum) and  xxxg1257xxx 
channels ( xxxg1257xxx ; ic50 018.7 mum) with maximum current
reduction of 60.3 and 65.5 % in oocytes. ic50 values obtained
from mammalian cells yielded 6.1 mum ( xxxg1256xxx ) and 5.2 mum
( xxxg1257xxx ). the molecular mechanism of action was studied in
detail.  xxxd1944xxx  block affected open and closed channels.
 xxxg1257xxx  currents were reduced in frequency-dependent fashion
in contrast to  xxxg1256xxx . mutagenesis studies revealed that amino
acid residues implicated in  xxxg1257xxx  drug interactions were not
required for  xxxd1944xxx  blockade. the class iii antiarrhythmic drug  xxxd1944xxx  targets multiple human cardiac twopore-domain potassium channels, including atrial-selective
 xxxg1257xxx  currents. k2p current inhibition by  xxxd1944xxx  represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of action that
extends the multichannel blocking profile of the drug.

introduction
atrial fibrillation (af) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and effective pharmacological management
of af still remains an unmet medical need.  xxxd1944xxx  has
been developed to overcome adverse effects of the established class iii antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone (kathofer et
al. 2005; ehrlich and nattel 2009; schweizer et al. 2011).
the athena trial demonstrated a reduction of a combined
end point of death or hospitalization due to cardiovascular
events (hohnloser et al. 2009).  xxxd1944xxx  is currently
available for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent
af. more recently, the pallas study revealed increased
rates of heart failure, stroke, and death from cardiovascular
causes in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, highlighting significant limitations of  xxxd1944xxx  in this population (connolly et al. 2011). at the molecular level,
 xxxd1944xxx  acts as multichannel blocker, targeting
k+, na+, ca2+, and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic
nucleotide-gated (hcn) channels (thomas et al. 2003;
kathofer et al. 2005; bogdan et al. 2011; schweizer et
al. 2011). in addition, the drug exhibits alpha- and betaantagonistic properties. despite its widespread clinical
use,  xxxd1944xxx  effects on cardiovascular electrophysiology are insufficiently understood. this is particularly
significant as comprehensive knowledge of the molecular mechanism of action is critical for clinical application safety of this novel antiarrhythmic compound.
the emerging family of two-pore-domain potassium
(k2p) channels stabilizes the resting membrane potential
and facilitates repolarization (thomas and goldstein

1004

2009). regulation of k2p background currents is a mechanism for control of cellular excitability (patel and honore
2001; bayliss et al. 2003; thomas et al. 2008; staudacher et
al. 2011a, b; gierten et al. 2012; rahm et al. 2012). in the
heart, genetic inactivation or inhibition of two-pore-domain
k+ (k2p) currents by class iii antiarrhythmic drugs results in
action potential prolongation and suppression of electrical
automaticity (lalevée et al. 2006; putzke et al. 2007; decher
et al. 2011; donner et al. 2011; limberg et al. 2011). in
particular, human  xxxg1257xxx  ( xxxg1257xxx , tandem of p domains in
a weak inward rectifying k+ channel (twik)-related acid
sensitive k+ channel 1) channels are selectively expressed in
atria and represent targets for the pharmacological management of atrial fibrillation with amiodarone or carvedilol
(xian tao et al. 2006; limberg et al. 2011). furthermore,
stretch-sensitive  xxxg1256xxx  ( xxxg1256xxx , twik-related k+ channel) channels are implicated in mechanoelectrical feedback
and arrhythmogenesis (xian tao et al. 2006). atrial
expression of additional k2p channels has been revealed
(e.g., k2p6.1, k2p17.1); however, their functional significance remains to be confirmed (decher et al. 2001; liu
et al. 2004). finally, k2p-mediated k+ conductance contributes to the regulation of vascular tone and diameter in
systemic and pulmonary arteries (gurney and manoury
2009; seyler et al. 2012).
effects of  xxxd1944xxx  on cardiovascular two-pore domain k+ channels have not been addressed to date. this
study provides a systematic assessment of  xxxd1944xxx  sensitivity among all functional human k2p channels. biophysical mechanisms of  xxxg1256xxx  and  xxxg1257xxx  blockade were
studied in detail to provide a more complete characterization
of the electrophysiological profile of  xxxd1944xxx . furthermore, the identification of vascular k2p channel targets may
provide a potential mechanistic explanation for side-effect
liability of  xxxd1944xxx .

and k2p17.1 (eu978944). in vitro transcription was performed as published (thomas et al. 2008). after vector
linearization, cdna was transcribed using t7 dna polymerase and the mmessage mmachine kit (ambion, austin,
usa). rna transcripts were quantified by spectrophotometry after separation by agarose gel electrophoresis.
oocyte preparation
the investigation conforms to the directive 2010/63/eu of
the european parliament. approval was granted by the local
animal welfare committee (reference number a-19/07).
all experiments have been carried out in accordance with
the united states national institutes of health guide for the
care and use of laboratory animals (nih publication no.
85-23, revised 1996) as reported earlier (gierten et al. 2008;
staudacher et al. 2011b; seyler et al. 2012). briefly, oocytes
were isolated from xenopus laevis ovarian lobes after surgical exstripation during tricaine anesthesia (1 g/l; ph 7.5).
oocyte collection was alternated between left and right
ovaries, and a maximum of three surgeries were performed
on one individual frog. after the final collection of oocytes,
anesthetized frogs were killed by decerebration and pithing.
complementary rna (0.25–23 ng; 46 nl/oocyte) was
injected into stage v–vi defolliculated xenopus oocytes.
tissue culture
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells were cultured in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine
serum (invitrogen), 100 u/ml  xxxd2871xxx  sodium, and
100 mug/ml streptomycin sulfate in an atmosphere of
95 % humidified air and 5 % co2 at 37 °c (gierten
et al. 2008). cells were passaged regularly and subcultured prior to treatment. transient transfections of cho
cells were performed using fugene hd transfection
reagent (promega, madison, usa) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

molecular biology
electrophysiology
complementary dnas encoding human k2p1.1 k274q
(rajan et al. 2005),  xxxg1256xxx  (genbank accession number,
ef165334),  xxxg1257xxx  ( xxxg1257xxx ), and  xxxg1258xxx 
(nm_016601) were kindly provided by steve goldstein
(chicago, usa), and hk2p18.1 cdna (nm_181840) was
obtained from c. spencer yost (san francisco, usa). niels
decher (marburg, germany) contributed mutant hk2p3.1
t92a and hk2p3.1 t198a constructs (streit et al. 2011).
amplification of the following human cdnas was previously described (gierten et al. 2008): hk2p4.1 (eu978935),
k 2p 5.1 (eu978936), k 2p 6.1 (eu978937), k 2p 10.1
(eu978939), k2p13.1 (eu978942), k2p16.1 (eu978943),

two-electrode voltage clamp (tevc) measurements on
x. laevis oocytes were performed 1 to 3 days after
oocyte injection as described earlier (thomas et al.
2008; gierten et al. 2012). macroscopic currents were
measured with an oc-725 c amplifier (warner instruments, hamden, usa). data were sampled at 2 khz
and filtered at 1 khz. current recordings from cho
cells were carried out using the whole-cell patch clamp
technique with an rk-400 amplifier (bio-logic sas,
claix, france) as reported (thomas et al. 2001; gierten
et al. 2008). pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass

naunyn-schmiedeberg's arch pharmacol (2012) 385:1003–1016

(1b120f-4; world precision instruments, berlin, germany) using a flaming/brown p-87 micropipette puller
(sutter instruments, novato, usa). all experiments
were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °c), and
leak currents were not subtracted. the holding potential
was −80 mv in all experiments performed in this study.
solutions and drugs
tevc electrodes were filled with 3 m kcl. the bath
solution contained 96 mm nacl, 4 mm kcl, 1.1 mm
cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, and 5 mm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid (hepes) (ph 7.4). human
k2p16.1 and k2p17.1 currents were activated by adjusting
the extracellular ph to 8.5 (gierten et al. 2008). for wholecell patch clamp recordings from cho cells, electrodes
were filled with the following solution (in millimolars):
100 k-aspartate, 20 kcl, 2.0 mgcl2, 1.0 cacl2, 10 egta,
2 atp, and 10 hepes, (ph 7.2). the external solution for
these experiments contained (in millimolars): 140 nacl,
5.0 kcl, 1.0 mgcl2, 1.8 cacl2, 10 hepes, and 10 glucose
(ph adjusted to 7.4 with naoh).  xxxd1944xxx  (toronto
research chemicals, north york, canada) and amiodarone
(sigma-aldrich, steinheim, germany) were dissolved in
 xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) to stock solutions of 100 mm
and stored at 4 °c. sotalol (bristol myers squibb, regensburg, germany) was prepared as 10 mm stock solution in
h2o and stored at 4 °c. on the day of experiments, aliquots
of the stock solutions were diluted to the desired concentrations with the respective external solution.

results
 xxxd1944xxx  targets human k2p background potassium
channels
 xxxd1944xxx  sensitivity was assessed in all functional human k2p channels using the x. laevis oocyte expression
system. from a holding potential of −80 mv, currents were
activated using depolarizing pulses (500 ms) to voltages
between −140 and +60 mv in 20-mv increments. current
amplitudes were measured at the end of the +20-mv pulse.
this protocol was used in all experiments in this study,
unless indicated. human k2p1.1 subunits were previously
revealed to produce functional channels when a lysine residue at position 274 is replaced by glutamine (rajan et al.
2005; feliciangeli et al. 2007). thus, we expressed
k2p1.1 k274q crna to achieve significant current levels.
electrophysiological effects of 100 mum  xxxd1944xxx  (30-min
incubation) on k2p family members are summarized in fig. 1.
 xxxd1944xxx  significantly inhibited human k2p channels 2.1
( xxxg1256xxx ; −60.3 ±2.8 %; n 09; p< 0.0001), 3.1 ( xxxg1257xxx ;
−65.5±2.3 %; n09; p<0.0001), 6.1 (twik2; −10.7±2.0 %;
n05; p00.009), and 9.1 ( xxxg1258xxx ; −31.7±3.2 %; n05; p0
0.011). in contrast, hk2p13.1 (tandem pore domain halothaneinhibited k+ channel (thik)1; +14.9±4.4 %; n05; p00.049)
and hk 2p 18.1 (twik-related spinal cord k + channel
(tresk); +29.0±4.3 %; n05; p00.016) channels were activated by  xxxd1944xxx . k2p5.1 (task2) current enhancement
(+46.3±11.4 %; n05; p00.052) did not reach statistical significance. application of the solvent (0.1 % dmso; 30 min)
did not significantly affect mean k2p current amplitudes (n0
3–5; fig. 1, black bars).

data analysis and statistics
data are presented as mean ± standard error of the
mean (sem). pclamp (axon instruments, foster city,
usa), origin 6 (originlab, northampton, usa), and
excel (microsoft, redmond, usa) software were used
for data acquisition and analysis. concentration–response relationships for drug-induced block were fit
with a hill equation of the following form: idrug/iconn
 xxxd3105xxx  0 1/[1 + (d/ic50) ], where i indicates current, d is the
drug concentration, n is the hill coefficient, and ic50
is the concentration necessary for 50 % block. statistical
comparisons were performed using paired and unpaired
student’st tests (two-tailed tests), where appropriate. a
p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
multiple comparisons were performed using one-way
anova. if the hypothesis of equal means could be
rejected at the 0.05 level, pairwise comparisons of
groups were made and the probability values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the bonferroni
correction.

inhibition of cardiac  xxxg1256xxx  and  xxxg1257xxx  channels
by  xxxd1944xxx 
pharmacological actions of  xxxd1944xxx  were studied in
detail focussing on two k2p channels with confirmed functional significance in the cardiovascular system, hk2p2.1
and hk2p3.1 (xian tao et al. 2006; putzke et al. 2007;
gurney and manoury 2009; seyler et al. 2012). channels
expressed in oocytes were activated by 500-ms depolarizing
steps to +20 mv, and currents were measured at the end of
the test pulse every 2 min (fig. 2a, d). after a control period
with no significant amplitude changes (20 min),  xxxg1256xxx  and
 xxxg1257xxx  currents decreased rapidly upon administration of
100 mum  xxxd1944xxx  (fig. 2b, e). inhibitory effects of
100 mum  xxxd1944xxx  were partially reversible (fig. 2b, e).
current levels reached 66.9 ± 5.2 % ( xxxg1256xxx ; n 05) and
45.6±3.7 % ( xxxg1257xxx ; n05) of controls 20 min after removal
of the drug.  xxxd1944xxx  reduced  xxxg1256xxx  and  xxxg1257xxx  potassium currents in a concentration-dependent manner. currents in the presence of the drug were normalized to their

center, currents were quantified at +20 mv membrane voltage. significant current reduction was observed with human  xxxg1256xxx ,  xxxg1257xxx ,

k2p6.1, and  xxxg1258xxx , while hk2p13.1 and hk2p18.1 channels were
activated. administration of the solvent, dmso (0.1 %, filled columns;
n03–5 cells), did not significantly modulate k2p channels. data are

respective control values and plotted as relative current
amplitudes (fig. 2c). the half-maximal concentrations
(ic50) for inhibition of two-pore-domain channels  xxxg1256xxx 
and  xxxg1257xxx  were 26.7±7.5 mum and 18.7±4.5 mum with hill
coefficients nh of 2.0±0.5 and 1.7±0.5, respectively (n05
to 9 cells were studied at each concentration). blockade of
cardiovascular k2p channels remained incomplete with
maximum current reduction of 60.3 and 65.5 % in oocytes
(fig. 2c), a finding similar to amiodarone inhibition of
 xxxg1257xxx  reported earlier (gierten et al. 2010).
to probe specificity of the pharmacological action of
 xxxd1944xxx  on  xxxg1256xxx  and  xxxg1257xxx  among class iii antiarrhythmic drugs, we studied the effects of amiodarone
(100 mum) and sotalol (100 mum) under similar experimental
conditions. application of amiodarone did not significantly

affect hk2p2.1 currents (n06; p00.08), whereas hk2p3.1
channels were reduced by amiodarone (−64.3±0.76 %; n0
4; p00.025) (fig. 2f) as described (gierten et al. 2010). in
contrast, sotalol did not significantly inhibit  xxxg1256xxx  (n03;
p00.12) or  xxxg1257xxx  currents (n05; p00.41) (fig. 2f).
biophysical characteristics of k2p channel blockade
drug effects on k2p current voltage (i–v) relationship were
investigated under isochronal recording conditions. currents
were recorded as described in fig. 1. representative families
of  xxxg1256xxx  and  xxxg1257xxx  current traces are shown for control
conditions and after application of 100 mum  xxxd1944xxx  for

amiodarone and sotalol on k2p channels in comparison with  xxxd1944xxx . currents were recorded as described in a. mean ± sem relative
current amplitudes and structural formulas are displayed (***p<0.001
versus respective control measurements). dotted lines indicate zero
current level

maximal activation voltages (v1/2) normalized to current
amplitudes recorded at +60 mv yielded 24.0 ± 0.5 mv
(k2p2.1control), 23.3 ± 0.7 mv (k2p2.1dronedarone ), 13.0 ±
0.3 mv (k2p3.1control), and 9.6±1.5 mv (k2p3.1dronedarone).
relative current inhibition was plotted as function of the test
pulse potential in fig. 3e ( xxxg1256xxx ; n09) and fig. 3h ( xxxg1257xxx ;
n09). reduction of k2p currents was not significantly different between −40 and +60 mvor between −140 and −100 mv
(fig. 3e, h). however, the effect of  xxxd1944xxx  was significantly reduced at potentials below the reversal potential compared to −40 mv (fig. 3e, h).
reduction of hk2p2.1 and hk2p3.1 background k+ currents by  xxxd1944xxx  (100 mum; 30 min) was associated with
changes in resting membrane potential (rmp; fig. 3i).  xxxd1944xxx  depolarized the rmp oocytes expressing  xxxg1256xxx 
channels by 4.6±0.9 mv to −55.7±3.8 mv compared to
control recordings (rmp0−60.2±3.6 mv; n06; p00.005).
in cells expressing  xxxg1257xxx , the rmp was depolarized by
8.9 ± 1.5 mv to −61.1 ± 1.3 mv compared to controls
(rmp0−70.0±1.3 mv; n05; p00.004).
macroscopic hk2p2.1 and 3.1 currents can be divided
into an instantaneous (measured 2 ms after the step to
+20 mv) and a time-dependent current component (measured at the end of the 500-ms test pulse), respectively

(fig. 3j). the instantaneous current was 80.4 ± 2.7 %
(hk2p2.1; n011) and 74.5±2.8 % (hk2p3.1; n09) of the
fully activated current under control conditions in the absence of the drug. inhibition of the instantaneous component
by 100 mum  xxxd1944xxx  (30 min) was weaker compared to
blockade of maximum currents for hk2p2.1 (−50.9±3.4 %
versus −60.9±3.4 %; p<0.0001) and for hk2p3.1 (−59.3±
2.3 % versus −68.4±2.4 %; p00.00007) (fig. 3j).
 xxxd1944xxx  affects closed and open conformations
of hk2p2.1 and hk2p3.1 channels
state-dependent blockade of k2p channels hk2p2.1 and
hk2p3.1 was analyzed using a single depolarizing step from
the holding potential (−80 mv) to +20 mv for 7.5 s. increased activation rates (i.e., faster transitions from closed to
open states of single channels) were observed at more positive potentials in previous studies (lopes et al. 2000;
bockenhauer et al. 2001). currents were recorded under
control conditions and after application of 100 mum  xxxd1944xxx  for 30 min while keeping the membrane potential at
−80 mv. the degree of inhibition after the incubation period
is displayed with linear and logarithmic time scales in
fig. 4a–d. during the +20-mv step, we expect that more

p00.03) and 64.1±7.4 % (hk2p3.1, n05; p00.002). to
provide a quantitative measure of current rectification, the
ratio between outward current (iout; determined at +50 mv)
and inward current (iin; recorded at −100 mv) was calculated for hk2p2.1 and hk2p3.1 currents under control conditions and in the presence of 100 mum  xxxd1944xxx ,
respectively.  xxxd1944xxx  reduced the absolute iout/iin ratio
of hk2p3.1 from 29.6±4.7 to 13.3±5.2 (n05; p00.0006),
indicating decreased outward rectification after drug treatment (fig. 4f). the apparent reduction of hk2p2.1 outward
rectification by  xxxd1944xxx  from 43.3±14.7 to 23.8±8.8
(n05; p00.08) was not statistically significant (fig. 4e).
please note that very low k2p inward current amplitudes
may have prevented the detection of significant inward k+
current blockade.
 xxxg1257xxx  inhibition by  xxxd1944xxx  is frequency dependent
to study the frequency dependence of block, human k2p
channels were rapidly activated by a depolarizing step to
+20 mv (500 ms) at intervals of 1 or 10 s, respectively. the
development of current reduction in the presence of 100 mum
 xxxd1944xxx  was plotted versus time (fig. 4g, h). blockade
of hk2p3.1 channels was frequency dependent. the degree
of inhibition after 30 min was significantly (p00.0001)
higher at 1-hz stimulation rate (67.3 ±3.5 %; n05; p0
0.002) compared to 0.1 hz (30.4±3.8 %; n05; p00.046).
in contrast to hk2p3.1, inhibition of hk2p2.1 was similar at
1-hz (51.4±2.1 %; n06; p00.0005) and 0.1-hz (42.0±
4.5 %; n09; p<0.0001) stimulation rates.
concentration-dependent blockade of hk2p2.1 and hk2p3.1
channels expressed in mammalian cells
concentration–response relationships obtained from mammalian expression systems are required to evaluate the clinical significance of drug–receptor interactions in a more
physiological setting. we expressed k2p potassium channels
heterologously in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells to
analyze channel sensitivities (fig. 5). from a holding

potential of −80 mv, depolarizing pulses were applied for
500 ms to voltages between −120 and +80 mv in 20-mv
increments (0.2 hz). the degree of inhibition was determined at +60 mv after reaching steady-state conditions
(usually within 4–6 min) (fig. 5a, b). the ic50 values for
blockade of hk2p2.1 and hk2p3.1 background channels in
cho cells yielded 6.1±0.5 mum (hill coefficient nh 02.1±
0.2; fig. 5c) and 5.2±0.1 mum (hill coefficient nh 01.5±
0.04; fig. 5d). three to five cells were investigated at each
concentration. untransfected control cells did not exhibit
significant k+ conductance under the given experimental
conditions (n04; fig. 5e).
 xxxd1944xxx  inhibition of hk2p3.1 channels does not
involve threonine pore residues t92 and t198
molecular determinants of  xxxg1257xxx  channel blockade by the
experimental compound a1899 were recently revealed
(streit et al. 2011). threonine residues located within the
k+ selectivity signature sequence of each pore-forming domain (fig. 6a, b) are required for high-affinity a1899 binding, as mutation to alanine residues markedly reduced drug
affinity. we investigated the effects of 100 mum  xxxd1944xxx 
on mutant  xxxg1257xxx  t92a and  xxxg1257xxx  t198a channels to
assess the significance of these amino acid residues in
 xxxd1944xxx  blockade of  xxxg1257xxx . currents were recorded
as described in fig. 1, and amplitudes were determined after
30-min of drug application at +20 mv (fig. 6c, d). inhibition of mutant  xxxg1257xxx  t92a (−70.9±2.2 %; n05; p00.005)
and  xxxg1257xxx  t198a channels (−72.9 ± 2.2 %; n 05; p 0
0.0009) was not attenuated compared to wild-type currents
(−65.5±2.3 %; n09; p<0.0001) (fig. 6e).

discussion
cardiac k2p background k+ currents are inhibited
by the class iii antiarrhythmic drug  xxxd1944xxx 
human cardiovascular  xxxg1256xxx  and  xxxg1257xxx  background potassium currents are inhibited by  xxxd1944xxx . k2p channel
inhibition extends the electrophysiological multichannel
blocking profile of the drug (table 1). the ic50 values
obtained from xenopus oocytes were 26.7 mum ( xxxg1256xxx )
and 18.7 mum ( xxxg1257xxx ), respectively. these findings were
extended to ik2p2.1 and ik2p3.1 recorded from mammalian
cho cells, revealing ic50 values of 6.1 and 5.2 mum, respectively. this 3.6- to 4.4-fold difference in sensitivity
between xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells has been
observed previously (thomas et al. 2001; obers et al. 2010;
staudacher et al. 2011c) and is related to specific properties
of oocytes (e.g., the vitelline membrane and the yolk) that
reduce the actual drug concentration at the plasma

membrane.  xxxd1944xxx  blocked or activated additional
k 2p channel family members that have not yet been
assigned cardiovascular function (fig. 1).  xxxd1944xxx 
plasma concentrations between 142 and 248 nm have been
reported, and metabolic interactions via cyp3a4 metabolism increase mean plasma levels by up to 10-fold (dorian
2010). the in vitro plasma protein binding of  xxxd1944xxx 
is >98 %. assuming similar protein binding in vivo, free
 xxxd1944xxx  levels yield 2.8–5.0 nm and may be increased
to 28–50 nm through metabolic interactions. taking into
consideration that free plasma concentrations differ from
experimental ic50 values by ~104- to 2,179-fold, k2p current inhibition may not be clinically relevant in the majority
of patients receiving  xxxd1944xxx . rather, a comparison of
experimental pharmacological data with therapeutic plasma
concentrations indicates that the overall antiarrhythmic efficacy of  xxxd1944xxx  in atrial fibrillation may primarily
result from a combination of electrophysiological effects
on herg/ikr and ik,ach with additional action on ica,l,
ina, and hcn4 (table 1).

blocked in their closed and open states (fig. 4). closed state
block is reflected by current inhibition observed at the
beginning of the test pulse, whereas time-dependent blockade indicates open state block. in addition, open channel
block is illustrated by the observation that block of sustained
 xxxg1256xxx  and  xxxg1257xxx  current was more pronounced compared
to reduction of instantaneous currents (fig. 3). we acknowledge limitations caused by the lack of definitive differentiation between open and closed states as the channels may
open over the entire voltage range, albeit with different open
probabilities. open rectification, a biophysical property
characteristic to k2p channel function in physiological ionic
conditions, was reduced by  xxxd1944xxx  (fig. 4). inhibition
was more pronounced during voltage steps below the reversal potential compared to more depolarized potentials
(fig. 3), possibly caused by depolarization-facilitated movement of the positively charged drug molecule into the
channel pore cavity.
the rapid onset of block argues in favor of a direct
drug–channel interaction and against increased protein
turnover or accelerated protein degradation as molecular
mechanisms of action (fig. 2). unblocking occurred
slowly, and a complete washout could not be achieved
(fig. 2). incomplete reversibility may be attributed to
trapping of the drug molecule inside the k2p channel

biophysical characteristics of  xxxg1256xxx  and  xxxg1257xxx  blockade

pore cavity. intracellular accumulation of the drug may
further contribute to slow washout kinetics. open channel
block and relatively slow unblocking kinetics resulted in
frequency-dependent accumulation of hk 2p3.1 block
(fig. 4). however, steady-state inhibition of hk2p2.1
was not significantly different at 1-hz stimulation rate
compared to 0.1 hz despite similar blocking kinetics of
both channels. more rapid hk2p2.1 unblocking kinetics
(fig. 2) owing to structural differences could explain

channel-specific frequency dependence of  xxxd1944xxx 
block (milac et al. 2011).
structural determinants of drug binding
molecular interactions between pharmacological compounds and k2p channels are incompletely understood. in
a recent investigation, high-affinity blockade of hk2p3.1 by
the experimental drug a1899 was analyzed (streit et al.

2011). threonine residues located in the potassium selectivity filter sequences and pore-facing amino acids in transmembrane segments 2 and 4 of the channel were identified
as binding site. in contrast to a1899,  xxxd1944xxx  sensitivity was not reduced by mutation of threonine residues t92
or t198, respectively (fig. 6), indicating that these residues
were not required for  xxxd1944xxx  binding to hk2p3.1.
rather, different binding mechanisms of high-affinity (e.g.
a1899) and low-affinity inhibitors (e.g.,  xxxd1944xxx ) of
 xxxg1257xxx  channels are suggested. this notion is further supported by the lack of  xxxd1944xxx  specificity within the k2p
channel family (fig. 1), whereas a1899 selectively targeted  xxxg1257xxx  (streit et al. 2011). the precise molecular
mechanism of  xxxd1944xxx  binding to  xxxg1257xxx  needs to be
addressed in future studies, taking into consideration
recent reports of k2p channel crystal structures (brohawn
et al. 2012; miller et al. 2012).
clinical implications
af suppression may either be achieved by elimination of
electrical triggers (e.g., by electrical pulmonary vein isolation) or by prevention of electrical reentry. antiarrhythmic
drug therapy primarily aims at prolonging atrial action potential duration and refractoriness to suppress reentry. outward potassium currents repolarize the cardiac action
potential, and currents mediated by k2p channels may contribute to repolarization of cardiomyocytes (marban 2002).
there is evidence of k2p channel expression in human
atrium at the mrna level (ellinghaus et al. 2005; limberg
et al. 2011). in addition,  xxxg1257xxx  channel knockout mice
exhibit prolongation of action potentials and qtc intervals
(decher et al. 2011; donner et al. 2011), illustrating functional significance of cardiac k2p channels in rodents. furthermore, single-channel patch clamp recordings from
human atrial myocytes indicated functional  xxxg1257xxx  channel
expression in human atrium (limberg et al. 2011). however,
it is important to consider that the specific contribution of
 xxxg1256xxx  or  xxxg1257xxx  k+ channels to human atrial repolarization
has not yet been determined.
in terms of electrophysiological changes in af, preliminary evidence for k2p channel remodeling was provided by
ellinghaus et al. (2005). k2p1.1 expression was reduced in
af compared to individuals in sinus rhythm. limitations
arise from the small sample size (a total of 13 patients were
analyzed using real time pcr). cautiously considering the
limitations mentioned above, we speculate that blockade of
cardiac k2p channels could add to the antiarrhythmic efficacy of  xxxd1944xxx  in atrial fibrillation patients. frequencydependent inhibition of k2p potassium currents (fig. 4) may
be particularly beneficial, as prolongation of refractoriness is
required primarily during tachycardia, resulting in interruption of electrical reentry.

naunyn-schmiedeberg's arch pharmacol (2012) 385:1003–1016

in search for future antiarrhythmic drug therapy, compounds that specifically act on atrial-selective targets are
expected to be particularly effective while harboring little
potential to induce ventricular arrhythmia (ehrlich et al.
2008; dobrev and nattel 2010; ravens 2010; iwasaki et
al. 2011). in addition to the effect of  xxxd1944xxx  on atriumselective  xxxg1257xxx  channels described in this work, other
antiarrhythmic drugs target atrial k+ channels as well. propafenone,  xxxd2113xxx , dofetilide, and the experimental compound ave0118 inhibit ik,ach in human atrial cardiac
myocytes (voigt et al. 2010). additional experimental drugs
including inhibitors of ik,ach, ikur, or non-selective transient
receptor potential channels and activators of atrial gap junction proteins have been developed. their electrophysiological mechanism of action and antiarrhythmic efficacy are
currently being evaluated (ehrlich et al. 2008; dobrev and
nattel 2010; ravens 2010; iwasaki et al. 2011).
finally, vascular  xxxg1256xxx  and  xxxg1257xxx  currents have
been implicated in vasodilation. an emerging body of
evidence suggests that vasodilator-mediated relaxation of
vascular smooth muscle cells is impaired by reduction of
k2p currents (gurney and manoury 2009; goonetilleke
and quayle 2012; seyler et al. 2012). however, a mechanistic link between k2p channel-dependent vasoconstriction caused by  xxxd1944xxx  and an increased incidence
of stroke observed in the pallas trial remains speculative (connolly et al. 2011).

conclusions
the present study adds human  xxxg1256xxx  and  xxxg1257xxx  potassium
currents to the electrophysiological target profile of  xxxd1944xxx  and provides mechanistic evidence to establish cardiac k2p channels as antiarrhythmic drug targets.
