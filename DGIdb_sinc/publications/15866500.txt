abstract
a novel method employing high-performance liquid chromatograph–mass spectrometry (lc–ms) has been developed and validated for
the quantitation of plasma 2 -deoxyuridine (udr). it involves a plasma clean-up step with strong anion-exchange solid-phase extraction
(sax-spe) followed by hplc separation and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry detection (apci–ms) in a
selected-ion monitoring (sim) mode. the ionization conditions were optimised in negative ion mode to give the best intensity of the dominant
formate adduct [m + hcoo]− at m/z 273. retention times were 7.5 and 12.5 min for 2 -deoxyuridine and 5-iodo-2 -deoxyuridine, an iodinated
analogue internal standard (is), respectively. peak area ratios of 2 -deoxyuridine to is were used for regression analysis of the calibration
curve. the latter was linear from 5 to 400 nmol/l using 1 ml sample volume of plasma. the average recovery was 81.5% and 78.6% for
2 -deoxyuridine and  xxxd2323xxx , respectively. the method provides sufficient sensitivity, precision, accuracy and selectivity for
routine analysis of human plasma 2 -deoxyuridine concentration with the lowest limit of quantitation (lloq) of 5 nmol/l. clinical studies
in cancer patients treated with the new fluoropyrimidine analogue  xxxd425xxx  (n4 -pentoxycarbonyl-5 -5-fluorocytidine) have shown that
plasma 2 -deoxyuridine was significantly elevated after 1 week of treatment, consistent with inhibition of  xxxg2366xxx  (ts). these
findings suggest that the mechanism of antiproliferative toxicity of  xxxd425xxx  is at least partly due to ts inhibitory activity of its active
metabolite 5-fluoro-2 - xxxd1838xxx  (fdump). monitoring of plasma udr concentrations have the potential to help clinicians
to guide scheduling of  xxxd425xxx  or other ts inhibitors in clinical trials. marked differences of plasma 2 -deoxyuridine between human
and rodents have also been confirmed. in conclusion, the lc–ms method developed is simple, highly selective and sensitive and permits
pharmacodynamic studies of ts inhibitors in several species.

of 2 -deoxyuridine 5 -monophosphate (dump) to 2  xxxd3364xxx  5 -monophosphate (tmp), and this reaction
is the only de novo synthetic pathway for production of 2  xxxd3364xxx  5 -triphosphate (ttp). hence, this pathway
is crucial for dna synthesis and a critical target for the fluoropyrimidine drugs which are widely used in the treatment
of breast, gastrointestinal, and head and neck cancers [1,2].

anticancer drugs will selectively inhibit the rapid growth of
cancer cells by blocking dna replication and repair [3]. subsequent to ts inhibition, it is expected that accumulation of
dump occur as a consequence of reduced formation of tmp.
dump is then catabolized intracellularly to udr which effluxes from cells and can be measured in plasma. the observed rise in udr in clinical studies of ts inhibitors is taken
as evidence that ts inhibition also occurs in normal tissue
along with the tumour. the novel ts inhibitor,  xxxd425xxx ,
on the other hand, is thought to be selectively activated to
5-fu in the tumour. hence, ts inhibition should occur predominantly in the tumour and monitoring of plasma levels of
udr could provide an important surrogate marker of estimating drug response and to provide rational dose adjustment in
each patient for optimal therapeutic outcome with a minimum
of untoward side effects [4,5].
udr (fig. 1) is an oxypyrimidine, which is very polar and
weakly acidic (pka ∼ 9.3) in nature. the conjugated doublebond system of pyrimidine absorbs light in the uv region,
and most hplc assays of udr have used spectrophotometric
detection. only a few of these methods have been intended for
the measurement of plasma udr concentrations in humans,
which have been reported to range from 20 to 100 nmol/l
[5,6]. more recently, it has been argued that plasma udr levels are well below 50 nmol/l and beyond the sensitivity limit
of hplc-uv detection [7,8]. in contrast, an earlier study using radioimmunoassay (ria) found the mean human plasma
udr level to be 620 nmol/l [9]. therefore, there is significant
discrepancy in reporting plasma udr levels and an accurate reference concentration range in humans has not been
established. all the previously reported hplc-uv methods
involved tedious sample extraction procedures and extensive
chromatographic run time, 60 to 110 min for each sample, to
overcome the difficulties of separation of udr from interfering endogenous polar materials in plasma matrix. the major

problem encountered in these hplc-uv analyses is not only
the specificity and selectivity of detection methods but also
the complexity of sample workup procedures. the validation
of sample extraction procedure in these assays was not always
possible by the internal standard method due to the complex
plasma matrix. even with hplc coupled with photodiode
array (pda) detection, the validity of the characterization is
difficult to justify especially when the udr concentration is
low.
the availability of highly selective and sensitive lc–ms
chromatographic techniques permit accurate determination
of low levels of various compounds. given the uncertainty
in the specificity of hplc-uv for udr discussed above, we
sought to extend our previous work to the detection of nucleosides [10]. in this report, we describe the development of
a new simple solid-phase sample extraction procedure and a
novel lc–ms method for quantitation of plasma udr. the
described technique offers simpler sample preparation steps
and better selectivity in detection compared to conventional
hplc-uv. the application of this method is exemplified
from a clinical trial of  xxxd425xxx  in colorectal cancer patients. plasma levels of udr in human volunteers and rodents
are also reported.

2. experimental
2.1. chemicals and reagents
all aqueous solutions were prepared in milli-q water (millipore, milford, ma, usa). udr and 5-iodo-2 deoxyuridine (internal standard (is)) were obtained from
sigma (st. louis, mo, usa). hplc-grade acetonitrile and
methanol were purchased from mallinckrodt baker (sellbybiolab, sydney, australia).  xxxd2154xxx , acetic acid and

sodium hydroxide (naoh) were supplied by  xxxg257xxx  (poole,
uk). extract-clean anion-exchange (sax) solid-phase extraction (spe) cartridges (200 mg bed weight, 3 ml tube size)
were obtained from alltech (deerfield, il, usa). each spe
cartridge had ion exchange capacity of 0.15 meq/100 mg bed
weight.

udr and 5-iodo-2 -deoxyuridine, respectively. the ms data
were analysed using lc–ms workstation classs-8000␣ software (shimadzu scientific instruments, kyoto, japan). the
peak area ratios of the standards were used to obtain a nonweighting scheme regression equation and concentrations in
quality controls and study samples were then calculated using
measure peak area ratios and the regression equation.

2.2. instrumentation and chromatographic conditions
2.3. preparation of standards and control samples
the hplc–ms system used in the validation and application of the method consisted of a shimadzu lc–ms
qp8000␣ module (shimadzu scientific instruments, kyoto,
japan) equipped with a sil-10 autoinjector with sample
cooler and lc-10 in-line vacuum degassing solvent delivery
units. chromatographic control, data collection and processing were carried out using shimadzu class 8000 data software. hplc separation of analytes was performed on a waters atlantis dc18 3 ␮m, 150 mm × 2.1 mm reversed-phase
analytical column (waters, sydney, australia) coupled with
a 1 mm opti-guard pre-column (optimize technologies,
oregon city, usa). the eluant was a gradient mixture of
10 mm  xxxd2154xxx  with 2% acetonitrile (mobile phase a)
and acetonitrile:water (90:10) (mobile phase b) delivered at
0.25 ml/min and at ambient temperature. after equilibration
of the column with 100% a, the gradient profile was carried
out as shown in table 1. the volume of the reconstituted extract injected into the hplc was 20 ␮l. the eluate from the
hplc column was directed in series via a shimadzu spd1-av uv–vis detector operated in dual wavelength mode
(254 and 280 nm) into the ionization region of the mass spectrometer (shimadzu qp8000␣) without flow splitting. the
eluant outflow to detector was re-directed automatically to
waste from 0 to 6 min and at 14 min by means of a solvent
switching valve. the optimal mass spectrometric conditions
for udr detection was achieved in negative ion mode, with
a curved desolvation line (cdl) temperature of 230 ◦ c, a
cdl voltage of 45 v, deflector voltages of −35 v (use for
in-source collision induced dissociation) and a corona probe
voltage of −3 kv. the chemical ionization source probe temperature was set at 350 ◦ c and a nitrogen flow rate of 2 l/min
was used for the nebulization. mass spectra of both analytes
were acquired over the scan range m/z 100–500 in approximately 1 s. quantitative data were carried out using selectedion monitoring (sim) analysis. the ions selected to monitor
were m/z 273.2 and m/z 399.1 for formate adduct ions of

a stock standard solution of 2 mmol/l udr was prepared in water. this solution was further diluted with water to give a series spiking standard solutions with concentrations of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 ␮mol/l.
a 2 mmol/l stock standard solution of the internal standard  xxxd2323xxx  was prepared in water and diluted
with water to 10 ␮mol/l to give a working standard solution. stock solutions, prepared monthly, were subdivided into
1 ml aliquots and stored in 1.5 ml eppendorf sample tubes
at 4 ◦ c until use. working standard solutions were freshly
prepared for each run. blank human plasma for calibration,
stored at −80 ◦ c, were prepared in pooled normal human
plasma from heparinized whole blood which had been dialyzed with cellulose membrane tubing (molecular cut-off size
of 1000) overnight to remove endogenous udr as previously
described by longo et al. [11]. authentic qc samples were
prepared from pooled patients plasma of day 0 (low) and day
8 (high) to mimic the authentic study samples.
2.4. calibration and sample preparation
calibration curves ranging from 5 to 400 nmol/l of udr
in plasma were constructed by spiking udr into blank dialyzed human plasma (1 ml) with 40 ␮l of spiking standard
solutions. for the unknown samples, fresh whole blood was
collected in a pre-chilled heparinized blood tube kept on-ice,
and plasma was rapidly separated from cells by centrifuging
at 3300 × g at 4 ◦ c for 15 min. plasma samples were stored at
−80 ◦ c and thawed just prior to analysis. plasma calibration
standards, plasma and qc samples were spiked with 20 ␮l
of internal standards to give a final plasma concentration of
200 nmol/l. after brief mixing, 1 ml of acetonitrile was added
to each sample and these were kept on-ice for another 10 min
before centrifuging at 4 ◦ c, 16,000 × g for 10 min. the clear
supernatants were then carefully removed and adjusted to ph
12 with 40 ␮l of 2 mol/l naoh solution.
2.5. solid-phase extraction
selective isolation and extraction of udr from plasma
matrix is a crucial step prior to lc–ms sample analysis
to achieve better sensitivity and to evade unnecessary fouling of the chromatographic column. blank human plasma
spiked with 50 nmol/l udr was used for the initial screening study for recovery using different spe strategies. the

124

k.m. li et al. / j. chromatogr. b 820 (2005) 121–130

spiked plasma was subjected to various protein precipitation methods (10% trichloroacetic acid, 70% perchloric acid
and acetonitrile) and extracted with a range of spe resin
chemistries such as non-polar c18 (waters), mixed-mode
(waters qma, bond-elut certify ii and strata screen-a),
sax (alltech and bond-elut). the highest recovery and most
reproducible extraction procedure for udr were achieved
with the use of polystyrene divinylbenzene (ps-dvb) based
strong anion-exchange resins. the optimum spe procedure
was as follows: using a supelco visiprep spe vacuum manifolds (sigma-aldrich, sydney, australia), alltech extractclean sax-spe (3 ml, 200 mg) cartridges were preconditioned with 2 ml acetonitrile followed by 2 ml 0.01 mol/l
naoh. alkalised sample supernatants were then loaded on
the sax-spe cartridge with flow rate of not greater than
1 ml/min and the latter was rinsed with 2 ml acetonitrile.
the analytes were eluted with two fractions of 1 ml 10%
glacial acetic acid in water at flow rate of not greater than
1 ml/min. the eluant was dried under vacuum in a speedvac vacuum evaporator (savant instruments, farmingdale,
ny, usa) and the dried residue was re-dissolved in 50 ␮l of
10 mmol/l  xxxd2154xxx  with 2% acetonitrile (mobile phase a).
the mixture was centrifuged, the supernatant was then transferred to micro insert vials and 20 ␮l of reconstituted solution in duplicate was automatically injected into the lc–ms
system.
2.6. assay validation
2.6.1. linearity, precision, accuracy, recovery and
sensitivity
peak area ratios of udr to the internal standard measured
at each nominal concentration were used to construct nonweighted least-square linear regression curves. the inter- and
intra-run precision and accuracy of the method were evaluated on three separate days by triplicate analyses of blank human plasma containing udr at concentration ranging from 5
to 400 nmol/l. an estimate of the inter-run precision for udr
was obtained by one-way analysis of variance (anova) for
each test concentration using “run day” as the classification
variable [12]. the day mean square (dayms), error mean
square (errms) and the grand mean (gm) of the observed
concentration across analytical run days were obtained. the
inter-run precision was calculated for each calibrated standard as follows, when n is the number of replicates within
each analytical run:
inter-run precision =

[dayms − errms]/n]0.5
× 100%
gm

the intra-run precision was calculated for each calibration
standard as follows:
intra-run precision =

[errms]0.5
× 100%
gm

the accuracy was assessed for each calibration standard and
expressed as a percentage of bias ((mean value − nominal

value)/nominal value × 100). to study the effect of coextracted blank plasma matrix, recovery was conducted by
comparing responses of replicates of spiked plasma samples
(10 and 200 nmol/l) with those of blank extraction eluants
to which the same amounts of analytes had been added to
post-extraction. similar recovery study was also conducted
on authentic pooled patient plasma on day 0. the analytical
limits of assay were determined by analysis of five replicates
of different concentrations of spiked udr from a single pool
of plasma blank matrix. the lower limit of quantification
(lloq) was defined as the concentration, which produced
assay results within ±20% of the nominal concentration, with
a coefficient of variation less than 20%.
2.6.2. stability
for assessment of stability of udr in whole blood and
plasma, fresh whole blood and plasma samples spiked with
udr to a final concentration of approximately 50 and
150 nmol/l were used for short-term stability study at 23 ◦ c
and on-ice before extraction. these stability blood samples
were separated and assayed at 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 h interval. these
fresh plasma samples were also used to assess the long-term
storage effect. they were assayed in duplicate on the day of
preparation and the remainder of each control was divided
into multiple tubes and stored at −80 ◦ c. these control samples were removed and assayed periodically up to 3 months.
triplicate of each stability control samples (low and high concentrations) were also subjected to three freeze/thaw (4 ◦ c)
cycles to assess stability over a 3-day period.
2.7. clinical studies
the clinical studies were carried out in sydney cancer
centre, royal prince alfred hospital. plasma udr concentrations were measured in 26 cancer patients enrolled in an
on going clinical study evaluating the relationship between
predictive factors and therapeutic response to  xxxd425xxx 
in advanced colorectal cancer patients. the patients received
2 g  xxxd425xxx  twice daily orally for 2 weeks of a 3-week
cycle. heparinized blood samples (10 ml) were collected on
day 0, day 8, day 15 and day 22 of each cycle for plasma
udr assay. the blood collection procedures were described
in section 2.4. the plasma layer was removed and stored at
−80 ◦ c until analysis. plasma samples from normal volunteers and rodents were also collected and stored similarly.
these studies were approved by the ethics committees of
the central area health service and university of sydney,
respectively.
2.8. statistical method
the values shown are mean ± s.e. statistical analysis of
data was achieved by anova, paired and unpaired student’s
t-tests (graphpad prism programme). the minimum significance level for all statistical tests was set at p < 0.05.

3. results

endogenous peaks in the blank plasma precluded the use of
uv–vis detection for measurement of udr.

3.1. lc–ms analysis
typical mass spectral features of udr and internal
standard 5-iodo-2 -deoxyuridine under the atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization–mass spectrometry detection
(apci–ms) negative ion condition are shown in figs. 1 and 2,
respectively. both analytes produced predominant ions consistent with their formate adducts, [m + hco2 ]− at m/z 273
and 399. the high adduct formation (nucleophilic addition)
in the gas-phase maximised ms sensitivity for quantitation
of udr in the sample. the analytes could also be monitored
in positive mode, however, the peak intensity and the signalto-noise ratios were much less than those achieved using negative mode. the cleavage of glycosidic bonds with the loss
of deoxyribose sugar, m/z 116, also yield the corresponding
fragment ions uracil [m − h − 116]− of m/z 111 and deprotonated molecular ion [m − h]− with m/z 227 in udr, and
 xxxd540xxx  formate adduct [m + hco2 − 116]− with m/z
283 and  xxxd540xxx  ion [m − h − 116]− of m/z 237 in internal standard 5-iodo-2 -deoxyuridine. the described losses
and resulting fragment ions are consistent with the chemical
structures of both compounds. the general mass spectra, including fragmentations, are similar to those observed from
nucleosides with capillary fast atom bombardment (fab)
[13] and electrospray lc–m–ms [14]. the sim mass chromatograms of a representative plasma sample of blank, spiked
udr, 5-iodo-2 -deoxyuridine (is), patient on day 0, 8 and human volunteer, wistar rat, c-57 mouse are depicted in figs. 3
and 4a–d, respectively. the retention time for udr (7.5 min)
was identified by comparing with those of an authentic standard. no interfering endogenous peaks were observed in both
the plasma blank and unknown samples using lc–ms analysis. however, the presence of considerable interference from

the assay validated for linearity and reproducibility of the
calibration curves by running five separated duplicate freshly
prepared plasma standard of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and
400 nmol/l. the typical equation obtained by least squared
regression was y = 0.0021x + 0.025 for udr. regression coefficients (r2 ) were ≥0.989 for all calibration curves (table 2).
the intra- and inter-run accuracy (expressed as % bias) and
precision (expressed as %r.s.d.) for udr based on peak area
ratios are presented in table 3. the assay bias ranged from
−2.0 to 15.6% over the concentration range 5–400 nmol/l.
the inter-run precision for all concentrations was less than
13.4% and overall intra-run precision for udr was less than
12.9%.
the analytical recoveries of plasma udr in dialyzed blank
plasma was calculated from pre-spiked and post-spiked of
extracted plasma concentrations of 10 and 200 nmol/l. the
spiked plasma was then analysed by the described method.
recoveries from 10 separated batch assays over a 2-month
period were 79.7 ± 1.39% and 83.2 ± 1.53% for 10 and

2 -deoxyuridine (is) was 78.6 ± 1.35% (77.6 ± 1.69% and
79.7 ± 1.55% at udr concentrations of 10 and 200 nmol/l,
respectively). similar recovery results were obtained from
pooled authentic patient plasma. it is consistent with recoveries from dialyzed plasma samples and no matrix differences
were observed. the lowest limit of quantitation (lloq) was
determined by analysis of five replicates of different concentrations of plasma udr. using 1 ml of plasma sample, the
lloq for plasma udr was 5 nmol/l for which the r.s.d.
was less than 20%.
3.2.2. stability
the short-term stability of 50 nmol/l udr in plasma and
whole blood kept on-ice and 23 ◦ c is shown in figs. 5 and 6,
respectively. there were no significant changes when fresh
plasma or whole blood sample were kept on-ice for 2 h after
spiking with udr at both concentrations of 50 and 150 nmo/l.
however, the plasma udr of 50 nmol/l concentration was
significantly reduced (p < 0.05) when the incubations were
carried out at 23 ◦ c for 2 h for plasma samples. udr concentrations were significantly decreased to 87% (p < 0.01),
72% (p < 0.001) and 70% (p < 0.001) when the whole blood
samples incubated at 23 ◦ c after 0.5, 1 and 2 h, respectively.
similar reduction was observed with plasma udr concentration of 150 nmol/l. for long-term stability of plasma samples

stored at −80 ◦ c, repeated analysis of the control plasma udr
samples (50 and 150 nmol/l) showed no apparent changed
in concentration over 3 months. in addition, no significant
change in plasma udr concentration was also observed after
three freeze/thaw (4 ◦ c) cycles over a 3-day period (one-way
anova). the stock 2 mmol/l udr aqueous solutions were
stable for at least 4 weeks when store refrigerated.

3.3. clinical studies
the plasma udr concentrations in patients treated with
one cycle of  xxxd425xxx  are shown in fig. 7. the plasma
udr concentrations of treated patients were significantly
increased on day 8 (∼3-fold, p < 0.001), day 15 (2-fold,

basal levels. no significant change in udr levels in blood
samples obtained from the three normal volunteers occurred over the same period of time. there were large
significant differences in plasma udr concentrations between humans and rodents. plasma udr concentrations in
healthy volunteers (52.9 ± 3.17 nmol/l, n = 6) and cancer patients (48.2 ± 4.04 nmol/l, n = 26) were 9- and 76-fold less
than wistar rats (446 ± 24.3 nmol/l, n = 6) and c-57 mice
(3810 ± 60 nmol/l, n = 6), respectively. specifically, there

the removal of interference and the enrichment of analytes
for quantitation of pyrimidine nucleosides in plasma sample
has always been a challenging task for analytical chemists.
the difficulty is not only because of the very low concentration of these compounds present in the sample matrix but
also due to their hydrophilic properties which render isolation and separation from other polar endogenous compounds
extremely challenging. in particular, the use of hydrophobic
extraction phases (e.g. organic solvents, c18 cartridges) also
leads to the recovery of lipophilic endogenous compounds
from the matrix, which then accumulates on the analytic column. also, the resolution of polar analytes using hplc and
reverse-phase chromatography is always difficult. inadequate
sample preparation procedures are often a contributing factor
to error in subsequent analysis.
hplc-uv methods have been proposed and widely used
for the quantitative analysis of plasma nucleosides. conventional perchloric acid protein precipitation technique with
two-stage hplc runs has been used to measure nucleosides
in plasma matrix by uv detection [15,16]. these two-stage
assay procedures are complex, time-consuming and difficult
for batch processing for routine quantitative analysis. slight
variations in analytical conditions (temperature in particular), can lead to incorrect or incomplete recovery of the analyte in the first run. analytical methods using organic solvent acetonitrile for protein precipitation have also been applied for the quantitation of plasma udr in mice [17]. again,
the use of two-stage chromatographic runs (separated by
peak collection, lyophilization and chromatographic quantitation) to overcome the background interference precludes
these from being effectively used as a routine analytical methods. recently, spe resins (isolute env+) with hydroxylated
highly cross-linked polystyrene-based polymers have been
used to enhance the selectivity and specificity for the extraction of udr in human plasma [5,6]. even so, the problem
of lipophilic contaminants means that such methods require
inordinately long run times to ensure that a stable baseline
can be re-established after each sample. otherwise, chromatograms may be corrupted by the elution of peaks, which
originated from previous injections. for example, run times
used in the above methods have been as long as 110 min for
each sample.
in addition, human udr concentrations at well below
50 nmol/l are beyond the limit of sensitivity of hplc-uv detection have recently been reported [7,8]. marti et al. verified
the specificity of the uv absorption of udr peak by treating
each sample with purified  xxxg2365xxx  (tp) and
concluded that an endogenous peak, co-eluting at the same
retention time as udr, could account for falsely high concentrations in hplc-uv analysis. furthermore, endogenous

substances such as hippuric acid, aromatic acids and drugs
such as 6- xxxd2573xxx  ( xxxd2573xxx ) and methotrexate (mtx)
may interfere with the nucleosides analysis as has been reported [18]. the major problems encountered in these previous hplc-uv assays are the selectivity of the sample extraction techniques and quantitative analysis methods. even
with uv–vis photodiode array (pda) assays for the detection
and quantitation of udr, separation and identification may
be complicated by endogenous interferences in the sample
matrices. in our study, we confirmed that the chromatograms
acquired from uv detection at the usual wavelength of 254
and 280 nm could not be used to measure udr in human
subjects. with previously published methods, the extraction
efficiency could not be established because of interferences
in the detection of internal standards and in sample matrix.
the new sample clean-up procedure presented here involves a novel approach to the extraction of the udr using
polymeric-based (ps-dvb) sax-spe, which provides better and more selective recovery than other resin chemistries.
this cleanliness is due to the fact that most of the interferences are removed during the column rinsing steps using the
organic solvent acetonitrile, while the analytes present in the
plasma are retained on the column. being a weak acid, udr
is present almost entirely as monoanionic species at ph 12, so
that retention on the column is mainly from anion-exchange
mechanisms. the acetonitrile in the washing step served to
promote the ionic interaction whilst disrupting hydrophobic
interactions and hydrogen bonding to remove non-polar materials such as  xxxd2154xxx , lipid and other hydrophilic compounds in the plasma samples. the low ph eluent of acetic
acid then reversed the anion-exchange component of retention as udr molecules become unionized. indeed, sax extraction bed chemistry achieved improved analytical recovery for udr (79.7%) as compared to a previously reported
non-polar (70%) bonded phase spe chemistry [6]. the other
feature of the described plasma clean-up step was the use of
acetonitrile, as both the protein precipitant and rinsing solution, which produces a very clean and enriched udr plasma
extract for subsequent ms measurement. in theory, the described sax extraction method can also be applied for measuring other oxypyrimidines in different biological matrices
with slightly alternation of the ph and/or the organic solvents, which can be manipulated very predictably, in sample
loading and washing steps.
conventional reverse-phase c18 hplc columns used in
previous studies required the use of mobile phase that contain ion-pairing agents in order to retain and separate polar nucleosides [5,6]. although ion-pairing agents can turn a
reversed-phase hplc column into an ion exchange column
to provide better retention, ion-pair chromatography requires
very long column equilibration times, which are difficult for
running reproducible gradient separation and most importantly, are not compatible with mass spectrometry analysis.
retention of these types of polar analytes also requires the
use of mobile phases that contain very low organic modifier. therefore, under these aqueous conditions, conventional

129

c18 stationary phases can exhibit a sudden loss of retention
with the collapse of c18 chains. in this study, we have tested
several hplc columns (eps, prevail, aqua and atlantis)
specifically for analysing polar compounds. the difunctional
non-polar (dc18 ) bonding chemistry of the waters atlantis
column demonstrated a better retention for polar compounds
and was compatible with the very low organic mobile phase
(2%) used in the chromatographic runs. there was no apparent shift of retention time of the hplc runs observed in the
course of study.
the choice of sample matrix for preparation of calibration standards and qc samples is particularly challenging for
analysing endogenous compounds. it is problematic to simply prepare calibration samples by adding increasing amount
of udr to pooled human plasma as unknown samples with
low udr concentration will be out of the lowest calibration
range. more importantly, the absolute total mass of the analyte, at some point, needs to be known for analytical accuracy validation. in order to eliminate endogenous analyte
and preserve as much of the characteristics of the matrix
as possible, dialyzed plasma has been used for the method
validation [11,19]. this approach is superior to the use of
either aqueous or “artificial plasma” solutions [6]. the validation experiments in our study have shown that the assay
has very good accuracy and precision. the reproducibility
and sensitivity of the new method is appropriate for the measurement of plasma udr in both normal subjects and cancer
patients. the lower limit of quantitation of 5 nmol/l and linear
dynamic calibration range of 5–400 nmol/l of the assay are
adequate for the analysis of plasma udr in patients receiving ts inhibitors of both pre- and post-treatment concentrations without dilution of samples. the total chromatographic
run time of 25 min is also a significant improvement of sample turnaround time (2.5- to 4.4-fold increased) compared to
previous hplc-uv methods. our experiments showed that
udr stability in whole blood was very temperature sensitive
(figs. 5 and 6) and is consistent with the presence of high tp
activity in platelets and peripheral blood lymphocytes [7,20].
a significant loss of udr concentration in plasma samples
at 23 ◦ c also suggests that residual tp activity is present in
plasma [10].
as shown in figs. 3 and 4, no interfering endogenous
peaks were observed in the plasma samples using lc–ms
analysis. the described optimal ms condition for udr detection were achieved in negative ion mode which added further selectivity for detecting compounds as it required the
presence of acidic groups or electronegative elements in the
molecules for the production of negative ion. in general, the
production of negative ion (deprotonation) contains less energy than positive ion (protonation) and therefore produces
fewer fragments. the use of an internal standard 5-iodo-2 deoxyuridine of virtually the same physical and chemical
properties as udr in the described assay served to correct
for the changes of extraction efficiency and in mass spectrometer response during quantitative analysis. the recovery of is (average 78.6%) was consistent at both low and

high udr concentrations. quantitation using an internal standard method was not possible in previous hplc-uv techniques. our results provide the first reliable reference plasma
udr concentration (range 30–86 nmol/l) in humans using
lc–ms method. pharmacodynamic studies have shown that
oral  xxxd425xxx  produced significant elevation of plasma
udr after 1 week and over the first cycle of treatment, consistent with ts inhibition. these marked increases in plasma
udr concentrations are comparable to those previously reported in rodents [17] and patients [6]. these findings further
suggest that the mechanism of the antiproliferative toxicity of
 xxxd425xxx  is at least partly due to ts inhibitory activity of
its active metabolite fdump. the data described indicate that
plasma udr monitoring has the potential to assist clinicians
in the development of optimal schedules for  xxxd425xxx  or
other ts inhibitors in clinical trials. using the dialyzed human plasma calibration preparation, we have also confirmed
large differences in plasma udr levels between human subjects and rodents.
in conclusion, the new lc–ms method described here
provides major advantages in terms of simplicity of sample
extraction, selectivity of detection and turnaround time as
compared with previous hplc-uv methods. this method
has been successfully applied to analyse udr concentrations
in patients receiving  xxxd425xxx  treatment. the linear mass
spectrometer response over a wide dynamic range of concentrations of the method is useful for pharmacodynamic studies
of ts inhibitors in both humans and rodents.
