regulation of cellular functions by nutrients, including the
control of gene expression, is well documented in prokaryotes
and lower eukaryotes. in mammals, these responses have also
been observed, and lipids and carbohydrates, among other dietary constituents, have been shown to be important regulators
of gene expression (1–3). mammalian cells can also adapt to
dietary or pathological fluctuations in amino acid availability
(4, 5). amino acid limitation elicits a series of cellular responses, among which the up-regulation of amino acid transport systems was one of the first to be recognized (reviewed in
refs. 6 and 7). subsequently, a number of genes have been
shown to specifically change their expression levels following
amino acid deprivation, although the underlying mechanisms
are not completely known (4, 5). under such limiting conditions, amino acids play a signaling role in the cell, conveying
regulatory messages to the transcriptional machinery and affecting the turnover of specific mrnas and proteins (5, 8).
these processes are beginning to be understood with work
carried out mainly in cultured cells, given the complexity of the
response to amino acid deprivation in intact animals, which
includes nutrient-induced changes in hormone levels.
 xxxd2595xxx  is an essential amino acid required for protein
synthesis and participates, together with atp, in the formation
of  xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ),1 the principal biological
methyl donor (9 –11). upon transfer of its activated methyl
group to many different acceptor molecules,  xxxd3156xxx  is converted into s- xxxd3157xxx  ( xxxd3157xxx ), a molecule that
can be further hydrolyzed to adenosine and homocysteine in a
reversible reaction (10). homocysteine in turn may be converted into cystathionine or remethylated back to  xxxd2595xxx , depending on the cellular needs for this amino acid (10).
mammalian cells have developed a series of adaptive mechanisms that respond to fluctuations in  xxxd2595xxx  availability,
which have been best characterized in the liver and involve the
modulation of enzymatic activities implicated in methionine
metabolism (10, 12). some of these mechanisms, including the
capacity to remethylate homocysteine, are impaired in the
transformed cell, giving rise to the condition of “methionine
dependence” in cancer (reviewed in ref. 13).

in mammals, methionine adenosyltransferase (mat),
the enzyme responsible for  xxxd3156xxx 
( xxxd3156xxx ) synthesis, is encoded by two genes,  xxxg1378xxx 
and  xxxg1379xxx . in liver,  xxxg1378xxx  expression is associated
with high  xxxd3156xxx  levels and a differentiated phenotype,
whereas  xxxg1379xxx  expression is associated with lower
 xxxd3156xxx  levels and a dedifferentiated phenotype. in the
current study, we examined regulation of  xxxg1379xxx  gene
expression by  xxxd2595xxx  availability using hepg2
cells. in  xxxd2595xxx -deficient cells,  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression is rapidly induced, and methionine adenosyltransferase activity is increased. restoration of  xxxd2595xxx  rapidly down-regulates  xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels; for
this effect,  xxxd2595xxx  needs to be converted into
 xxxd3156xxx . this novel action of  xxxd3156xxx  is not mediated
through a methyl transfer reaction.  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression was also regulated by 5ⴕ- xxxd2619xxx , but
this was dependent on 5ⴕ- xxxd2619xxx  conversion to methionine through the salvage pathway. the
transcription rate of the  xxxg1379xxx  gene remained unchanged during  xxxd2595xxx  starvation; however, its
mrna half-life was significantly increased (from 100
min to more than 3 h). the effect of  xxxd2595xxx  withdrawal on  xxxg1379xxx  mrna stabilization requires both
gene transcription and protein synthesis. we conclude
that  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression is modulated as an adaptive response of the cell to  xxxd2595xxx  availability
through its conversion to  xxxd3156xxx .

salt produced by knoll (milan, italy) was from europharma (madrid,
spain). 5⬘- xxxd2619xxx  (mta) was generously provided by
knoll (milan, italy). all other reagents were of analytical grade, and
unless otherwise stated, they were purchased form sigma.
cell culture and treatment conditions—human hepg2 hepatoma
cells were obtained from the american type culture collection (atcc)
(manassas, va), and huh7 human hepatoma cells were from our tissue
culture facility at the university of navarra. cells were maintained in
minimum eagle’s medium (mem) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin (all from invitrogen) at 37 °c in a humid atmosphere of 5% co2
in air. to test  xxxg1379xxx  expression, cells were cultured in l-methioninedeficient mem supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and varying
concentrations of  xxxd2595xxx  (sigma). it has been estimated that
 xxxd2595xxx  concentration in bovine serum is around 15 ␮m, so the
final concentration of  xxxd2595xxx  in our experiments would be around
0.75 ␮m; in this work, this is referred to as  xxxd2595xxx  restriction. in
some experiments, cells were kept in krebs-ringer bicarbonate (krb)
and varying concentrations of  xxxd2595xxx . no significant differences
in cell viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion test, were
observed under the different treatments.
determination of mat activity and  xxxd3156xxx  levels—cells (3 ⫻ 106)
were lysed by freeze thawing in 300 ␮l of 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5)
containing 0.3 mm sucrose, 0.1% ␤- xxxd26xxx , 1 mm  xxxd302xxx , and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. the homogenate was
centrifuged for 30 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000 ⫻ g, and mat activity was assayed in
the supernatant as described previously (27). for the determination of
 xxxd3156xxx  concentrations, cells were lysed and deproteinized in 0.4 m
perchloric acid and centrifuged at 12,000 ⫻ g for 15 min at 4 °c.
supernatants were filtered and analyzed by high performance liquid
chromatography as described previously (27).
rna isolation and northern blot analysis—total rna was isolated
by the guanidinium thiocyanate method as described (28, 29). rna
concentration was determined spectrophotometrically before use, and
the integrity was checked by electrophoresis with subsequent ethidium
bromide staining. electrophoresis of rna and gel blotting were carried
out as described (27, 29). northern hybridization analysis was performed on total rna using standard procedures as described (27, 29).
all probes (human  xxxg1379xxx  and  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ) cdnas) were labeled with [32p]dctp using a random
primer kit (rediprime dna labeling system; amersham bisociences).
to ensure equal loading of rna samples, membranes were also hybrid-

nuclear run-on transcription assay—nuclei from 3 ⫻ 107 hepg2
cells kept in mem without  xxxd2595xxx  for different durations were
isolated as described previously (27). transcription reactions were performed for 30 min at 37 °c with 60 ␮l of the isolated nuclei in a final
volume of 200 ␮l in the presence of 100 ␮ci of [␣-32p] xxxd3475xxx  (800 ci/mmol; amersham biosciences) and 0.5 mm unlabeled
nucleotides essentially as described (27). elongated rna transcripts
were purified by phenol extraction as described above, denatured, and
hybridized (at equivalent amounts of radioactivity (i.e. 1–2 ⫻ 106 cpm))
to 5 ␮g of the corresponding cdnas and immobilized on nytran filters
in hybridization buffer (0.2 m napo4 (ph 7.2), 1 mm edta, 7% sds,
45% formamide, and 250 mg/ml escherichia coli transfer rna as carrier) for 48 h at 42 °c. the dnas used were the human  xxxg1379xxx ,
 xxxg861xxx ,  xxxg1471xxx ,  xxxg104xxx , and 18 s cdnas;
puc18 was used for background control. the filters were washed and
exposed to x-ray films. quantitation was performed by scanning densitometry of the x-ray films, using the molecular analyst software (biorad). data were normalized to the transcription of the  xxxg861xxx  gene,
the steady-state mrna levels of which were not affected by short term
 xxxd2595xxx  depletion.
statistics—unless otherwise stated, the data are means ⫾ s.e. of at

 xxxd3156xxx , is catalyzed by the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase (mat). in mammals, there are three isoenzymes for
mat (mat i, mat ii, and mat iii); mat i and mat iii are
two oligomeric forms (a tetramer and dimer, respectively) of
the protein coded by  xxxg1378xxx  gene, whereas mat ii is the
product of the  xxxg1379xxx  gene (11, 14, 15). the expression of both
genes is differentially regulated;  xxxg1378xxx  is expressed in the
adult hepatocyte, whereas  xxxg1379xxx  is expressed in all other
cells of the organism and in the fetal hepatocyte (11, 14).
interestingly,  xxxg1379xxx  expression is induced when the adult
hepatocyte proliferates (as occurs during liver regeneration)
and upon neoplastic transformation of the liver, where  xxxg1378xxx 
expression is silenced (11, 16 –18). although both enzymes catalyze the same reaction, they display distinct catalytic and
regulatory properties that impact on the intracellular concentrations of  xxxd3156xxx  (11). we have recently shown that in liver,
 xxxd3156xxx  plays a pivotal role in the regulation of essential cellular functions, such as the control of cellular proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis (18 –24); consequently, the levels
of this metabolite must be tightly controlled in this organ. in
the present work, we describe how expression of the  xxxg1379xxx 
gene is acutely regulated by the availability of  xxxd2595xxx 
and investigate the mechanisms behind this response. our
observations indicate that fluctuations in  xxxd2595xxx  availability regulate  xxxg1379xxx  expression mainly at the level of
mrna turnover; additionally, we demonstrate an essential
role for  xxxd3156xxx  in this response, further supporting the hypothesis of  xxxd3156xxx  as a signaling molecule in the liver (25).

on the levels of  xxxd2595xxx  in the culture medium, as observed when hepg2 cells were cultured for 24 h in mem
supplemented with increasing concentrations of this amino
acid (fig. 1b). the intracellular levels of  xxxd3156xxx  in cells cultured during 24 h in mem supplemented with 0, 100, or 1000
␮m  xxxd2595xxx  were 0.16 ⫾ 0.02, 1.04 ⫾ 0.06, and 1.52 ⫾ 0.01
nmol/mg of protein, respectively. the levels of  xxxg861xxx  mrna
and 18 s ribosomal rna were also measured, and no significant changes were observed (fig. 1, a and b). the induction of
 xxxg1379xxx  gene expression correlated with the up-regulation of
mat ii activity when measured 24 h after culture in  xxxd2595xxx -restricted mem (fig. 1c). the same observations were
made in huh7 cells (data not shown).
specificity of  xxxg1379xxx  response to  xxxd2595xxx  depletion—to determine whether the observed up-regulation of
 xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels was limited to  xxxd2595xxx  restriction in
culture medium, hepg2 cells were grown in complete mem
(100 ␮m  xxxd2595xxx ) until 70% confluence and subsequently
cultured in krb buffer for 2 h in the presence of 0 or 100 ␮m
 xxxd2595xxx . as shown in fig. 2a,  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression
was induced in methionine-deficient krb medium, whereas
the addition of  xxxd2595xxx  prevented this response. the expression of other genes related to  xxxd3156xxx  metabolic pathways,
such as  xxxg104xxx  and 5⬘- xxxg1471xxx , was also tested in hepg2 cells under
the above mentioned conditions, and no significant changes
were observed (fig. 2a).
we next examined the mechanisms through which  xxxd2595xxx  could mediate this acute effect on  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression. as previously stated, besides its involvement in protein
synthesis, intracellular  xxxd2595xxx  is metabolized into
 xxxd3156xxx  by the action of mat (fig. 3 summarizes  xxxd3156xxx 
metabolic pathways). we tested whether  xxxd3156xxx  could mimic
the effect of  xxxd2595xxx  on  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression. for this

purpose, hepg2 cells were cultured in methionine-restricted
mem for 24 h in the presence of 4 mm  xxxd3156xxx , and  xxxg1379xxx 
mrna levels were subsequently analyzed by northern blotting. intracellular  xxxd3156xxx  concentrations were measured in
control and  xxxd3156xxx -treated cells 8 h after the addition of this
compound. these concentrations were 0.20 ⫾ 0.01 and 5.02 ⫾
0.2 nmol/mg of protein in control and  xxxd3156xxx -treated cells,
respectively. as shown in fig. 2b, the potent induction of
 xxxg1379xxx  gene expression that occurs in the absence of  xxxd2595xxx  (lane 2) was not observed to such an extent when  xxxd3156xxx 
was added to the culture medium (fig. 2b, compare lanes 2 and
3). however, under the same conditions, the nonmetabolizable
d-isomer of methionine (at 100 ␮m) had no effect on  xxxg1379xxx 
gene expression (fig. 2b, lane 4). interestingly, mta (at 500
␮m), a product of  xxxd3156xxx  metabolism generated in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway and the first molecule in the methionine salvage route (30 –32) (fig. 3), was very effective in
preventing the induction of  xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels by methionine restriction (fig. 2b, lane 5). in liver cells, homocysteine
can be remethylated and converted back to methionine through
two alternative pathways that involve the enzyme methionine
synthase or the enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (10, 11) (fig. 3).  xxxg1479xxx  is a cobalamin-dependent enzyme that requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to convert homocysteine into methionine (33). we incubated hepg2
cells with homocysteine (200 ␮m),  xxxd2147xxx  (100 ␮m, a precursor of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate), and cyanocobalamin (15
␮m) for 24 h in the absence of  xxxd2595xxx . as shown in fig.
2b, lane 6, this treatment had no effect on  xxxg1379xxx  mrna
levels that were strongly induced after 24 h in a methioninedeficient medium. similarly, we explored the pathway catalyzed by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase for the conversion of homocysteine into methionine by incubating cells
with betaine (2 mm) and homocysteine (200 ␮m) for 24 h in the
absence of the  xxxd2595xxx  addition. this treatment was also
unable to modulate the induction of  xxxg1379xxx  mrna in response
to  xxxd2595xxx  restriction (fig. 2b, lane 7).
the induction of  xxxg1379xxx  mrna elicited by methionine restriction could be due either to an increase in transcription of
the gene or to increased mrna stability. consequently, we
have measured the effect of  xxxd2595xxx  restriction on the
transcription rate of the  xxxg1379xxx  gene in hepg2 cells by performing nuclear run-on studies. we observed that the transcription rate of the  xxxg1379xxx  gene remained constant at different time points after  xxxd2595xxx  withdrawal for up to 4 h;
similarly, the transcription rate of  xxxg861xxx  was not affected
under this condition (fig. 4a).

 xxxd3156xxx  regulates  xxxg1379xxx  mrna stability

we next tested whether ongoing transcription or translation
was necessary for the observed induction of  xxxg1379xxx  mrna
levels in response to  xxxd2595xxx  restriction. for this purpose,
cells were grown in complete mem until 70% confluence and
then transferred to  xxxd2595xxx -restricted mem in the presence of either  xxxd1800xxx  d ( xxxd1800xxx ) (5 ␮g/ml) or cycloheximide
(0.1 mm) for 3 h. as shown in fig. 4, b and c, both treatments
completely abolished the induction of  xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels.
these observations indicate that both transcription and protein
synthesis are required for the up-regulation of  xxxg1379xxx  gene
expression during  xxxd2595xxx  depletion.
 xxxg1379xxx  mrna is stabilized in  xxxd2595xxx -depleted
cells—taken together, our data suggest that  xxxd2595xxx  restriction increases  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression by stabilizing the
mrna. to support this hypothesis, we determined  xxxg1379xxx 
mrna half-life in complete and in  xxxd2595xxx -depleted
mem. hepg2 cells growing in complete mem were incubated
for different periods of time in the presence or absence of  xxxd1800xxx 
(5 ␮g/ml), and  xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels were measured by northern blotting. under this condition, we could estimate that
 xxxg1379xxx  mrna decayed with a half-life of ⬃100 min in lmethionine-supplemented medium (fig. 5a). in order to determine  xxxg1379xxx  mrna half-life in  xxxd2595xxx -restricted medium, cells were cultured in the absence of this amino acid for
4 h and then treated with  xxxd1800xxx  (5 ␮g/ml) for up to 3 h in the
same medium. as shown in fig. 5b, the level of  xxxg1379xxx  mrna
remained constant in  xxxd2595xxx -depleted cells, suggesting
an mrna half-life much longer than 3 h.
we wanted to further explore the mechanisms through
which  xxxd2595xxx  could mediate this acute regulation of
 xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels. we first determined whether  xxxd3156xxx 
and mta were acting on  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression also at the
level of mrna stability. for this purpose, hepg2 cells were
incubated for 4 h in  xxxd2595xxx -deficient mem, and then
 xxxd3156xxx  (4 mm) or mta (500 ␮m) was added to the cultures in

fig. 5. effect of  xxxd2595xxx  depletion on the half-life of
 xxxg1379xxx  mrna in hepg2 cells. a, quantitation of  xxxg1379xxx  mrna
levels in hepg2 cells kept in mem supplemented with 100 ␮m lmethionine in the absence (closed circles) or presence (closed triangles)

data are means ⫹ s.e. of three experiments performed in duplicate
(asterisk indicates p ⬍ 0.05 with respect controls without  xxxd1800xxx ). values
were normalized to 18 s rrna levels.

the absence or presence of  xxxd1800xxx  (5 ␮g/ml) and incubations
continued up to 6 h more. analysis of  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression
under these treatments indicated that both  xxxd3156xxx  and mta
shared with  xxxd2595xxx  its ability to down-regulate  xxxg1379xxx 
mrna in the absence of ongoing transcription (fig. 6). interestingly, mta needed to be metabolized through the methionine salvage pathway to exert its effect on  xxxg1379xxx  mrna
levels, since the concomitant addition of adenine (1 mm), an
inhibitor of  xxxg1471xxx , the first and rate-limiting enzyme in this
pathway (33), completely blocked its effect (fig. 6). of particular relevance is the observation that  xxxd2595xxx  has to be
metabolized and converted into  xxxd3156xxx  to mediate its effect on
 xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels, as evidenced when  xxxd2595xxx  treatment was performed in the presence of  xxxd1778xxx  (20 mm), a
competitive inhibitor of mat activity (34) (fig. 6). if under
these conditions (treatment with  xxxd2595xxx  and  xxxd1778xxx ) exogenous  xxxd3156xxx  (4 mm) was added to the cells,
 xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels were down-regulated (fig. 6). the addition of either adenine or  xxxd1778xxx  to  xxxd2595xxx -starved
cells had no effect on  xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels (data not shown).
as previously mentioned, an essential role of  xxxd2595xxx ,
through its conversion into  xxxd3156xxx , is to provide the cell with
the necessary activated methyl groups for a vast number of
transmethylation reactions. hence, it was important to know if
a transmethylation reaction(s) could be involved in the regulation of  xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels. for this purpose, l-methioninedeprived cells were treated with  xxxd2595xxx  in the presence
of the adenosine analog 3-deazaadenosine (c3-ado) (30 ␮m, 30
min prior to  xxxd2595xxx  addition) (37). c3-ado is an inhibitor
of  xxxg104xxx  and leads to a significant
increase in the intracellular levels of  xxxd3157xxx ; additionally, it
can be converted into the more stable 3-deaza-derivative of
 xxxd3157xxx  (s-3-deaza- xxxd3157xxx  (c3- xxxd3157xxx )) (37).
 xxxd3157xxx  and c3- xxxd3157xxx  are strong inhibitors of methylation
reactions (14, 37). we observed that the effect of  xxxd2595xxx 
was preserved in the presence of c3-ado (fig. 6), suggesting
that methylation reactions were not involved in the regulation
of  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression by this amino acid.

 xxxd3156xxx  regulates  xxxg1379xxx  mrna stability

discussion

in this work, we have provided evidence for the acute regulation of  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression in response to the availability
of  xxxd2595xxx . incubation of human hepatoma hepg2 cells
(and huh7 cells; not shown) in medium restricted in this
amino acid resulted in the rapid induction of  xxxg1379xxx  mrna
levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. a parallel increase in mat activity was observed in cells cultured
under reduced  xxxd2595xxx  availability, suggesting that
translation of  xxxg1379xxx  mrna was taking place even in the
presence of limiting amounts of  xxxd2595xxx . this observation
is in agreement with other reports showing the induction of
specific proteins under limited availability of  xxxd2595xxx  (38,
39).  xxxg1379xxx  gene response seemed to be mainly due to changes
in  xxxd2595xxx  levels and not to fluctuations in other amino
acids or nutrients. this may be inferred by our experiments in
which hepg2 cells were incubated in krb buffer and induction
of  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression was modulated by the sole addition
of  xxxd2595xxx .
as mentioned previously, besides its role in protein synthesis,  xxxd2595xxx  enters a metabolic pathway in which it is
converted, together with atp, into  xxxd3156xxx , the main methyl
donor compound in the cell. it was important to know if the
observed response of  xxxg1379xxx  gene to fluctuations in  xxxd2595xxx  levels could be related to this metabolic pathway. we
observed that  xxxd3156xxx  addition to  xxxd2595xxx -starved cultures was effective in down-regulating the expression of
 xxxg1379xxx  gene. this observation, together with the finding that
the nonmetabolizable d-isomer of methionine had no effect on
 xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels, provided the first evidence supporting
the concept that  xxxd2595xxx  mediates its effect on  xxxg1379xxx 
gene expression through its conversion into  xxxd3156xxx . we also
tested the effect of other molecules that are subsequent metabolic products of  xxxd2595xxx  and  xxxd3156xxx , such as homocysteine and mta. homocysteine treatment had no effect on
 xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels, suggesting that this metabolite was not
involved in the cellular signaling of  xxxd2595xxx  limitation.
homocysteine can serve as a precursor of  xxxd2595xxx  in all
cells; however, transformed cells, including hepatoma cells, are

unable to grow if homocysteine is used in place of methionine in
culture medium (13, 40, 41). our present data further support
this notion. with regard to mta, a product of  xxxd3156xxx  metabolism in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway and a precursor of
 xxxd2595xxx  in the so-called methionine salvage pathway, we
observed that it was able to modulate  xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels in
 xxxd2595xxx -starved cultures. as we later observed, mta effect was dependent on its metabolism through the methionine
salvage pathway and therefore probably due to its ultimate
conversion into this amino acid and subsequently into  xxxd3156xxx .
adenine, a product of mta metabolism and an inhibitor of
 xxxg1471xxx , the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the methionine
salvage pathway (30 –32, 35), blocked mta effect. methionine
dependence of tumor cells has been associated with defects in
 xxxg1471xxx  expression leading to the suppression of this salvage
pathway (13, 41, 42); however, this is not the case for hepg2,
where we found that  xxxg1471xxx  expression was normal (data not
shown). additionally, these data attest to the importance of the
methionine salvage pathway in methionine conservation under
limited supply of this amino acid and further support the
relevance of this metabolic route as a target in antineoplastic
therapy.
we have provided evidence showing that  xxxg1379xxx  gene transcription remained constant during  xxxd2595xxx  starvation at
least up to 4 h after the removal of this amino acid from the
culture medium. these data suggested that the potent effect of
 xxxd2595xxx  on  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression might take place at
the post-transcriptional level. in the regulation of gene expression by amino acids, both types of mechanisms, namely the
regulation of gene transcription and of mrna stability, have
been described. for instance, transcription of the asparagine
synthetase gene and the stability of the high affinity cationic
amino acid transporter-1 mrna are known to be modulated by
amino acid starvation (43, 44). in the case of certain genes,
such as cationic amino acid transporter-1, changes in its mrna
turnover rate alone account for the dramatic induction on the
expression of this gene in amino acid-depleted medium (44, 46).
because the  xxxg1379xxx  gene transcription rate was not significantly altered by  xxxd2595xxx  starvation, we measured
 xxxg1379xxx  mrna half-life in  xxxd2595xxx -fed and -starved cultures. we observed a significant increase in  xxxg1379xxx  mrna
half-life in response to  xxxd2595xxx  starvation. interestingly,
this effect was completely dependent on de novo protein synthesis. this observation suggests that a protein factor(s) may
be synthesized that binds and stabilizes  xxxg1379xxx  mrna when
cellular  xxxd2595xxx  levels are reduced. this kind of mechanism has been reported for the regulation of mrnas encoding
proteins such as transferrin receptor (45), the cationic amino
acid transporter-1 (46), and others (47).
once we established that  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression was regulated by  xxxd2595xxx  at the level of mrna turnover, we
confirmed that the observed effects of  xxxd3156xxx  and mta on
 xxxg1379xxx  steady state mrna levels were also mediated at this
same level. in these experiments, it was also clearly established that  xxxd2595xxx  per se was not sufficient to convey the
cellular signal(s) that modulated  xxxg1379xxx  mrna turnover.
conversion of  xxxd2595xxx  into  xxxd3156xxx  was absolutely necessary, given the fact that  xxxd1778xxx , a competitive inhibitor of
mat ii activity (34), completely abolished  xxxd2595xxx  action.
in line with this is the observation that when exogenous
 xxxd3156xxx  was added, the blockade imposed by  xxxd1778xxx  on
 xxxd2595xxx  effect was overcome. taken together, these findings provide an explanation for our previous observations made
in  xxxg1378xxx  knockout mice. these animals display dramatically
elevated levels of circulating  xxxd2595xxx  (around 8-fold increase compared with wild type mice), and at the same time the

expression of the  xxxg1379xxx  gene is induced in their liver (21).
these seemingly contradictory observations may be explained
by the fact that the hepatic concentration of  xxxd3156xxx  in these
knockout mice is reduced to about 25% of that found in wild
type animals (21).
another interesting finding was the observation that treatment with c3-ado, a compound that increases the intracellular
concentration of  xxxd3157xxx , and c3- xxxd3157xxx , two potent inhibitors
of methylation reactions, did not interfere with the effect of
 xxxd2595xxx  on  xxxg1379xxx  mrna levels. this finding suggests
that a methylation reaction is not involved in the effect of
 xxxd2595xxx  (and consequently of  xxxd3156xxx ) on  xxxg1379xxx  gene
expression, although we cannot exclude a methyl transfer reaction that would be resistant to  xxxd3157xxx  or c3- xxxd3157xxx  inhibition. we have previously described that  xxxd3156xxx  is able to
induce the transcription of the  xxxg1378xxx  gene in cultured rat
hepatocytes (24, 25) and that in this effect a methylation reaction is probably involved (24). now we report on a novel effect
of  xxxd3156xxx  on gene expression that occurs at the postranscriptional level and in which a different mechanism of action is
seemingly involved. an alternative mode of action for  xxxd3156xxx 
could be its direct binding to a cellular target structure. such
interaction of  xxxd3156xxx  is known to occur in eukaryotic cells, and
the best characterized target is the enzyme cystathionine
␤-synthase, which is allosterically regulated by  xxxd3156xxx  binding to a specific domain termed the cystathionine ␤-synthase
domain (49). interestingly, this cystathionine ␤-synthase domain is a widespread structure that was originally described in
archaebacteria and is well conserved throughout evolution (50).
given the central role played by  xxxd3156xxx  in cellular metabolism, the sharp induction in  xxxg1379xxx  gene expression in response to reduced  xxxd2595xxx  and  xxxd3156xxx  availability could
be regarded as an adaptive mechanism of the cell aimed at
preserving the intracellular levels of  xxxd3156xxx . as we have
shown, this is a finely tuned response, and we can envision
different potential explanations for this to be so. in the first
place, for each  xxxd3156xxx  molecule synthesized, one atp molecule and one  xxxd2595xxx  molecule are consumed at the expense of the homeostasis of cellular energetics and protein
synthesis (10, 11). additionally, recent observations suggest
that  xxxd3156xxx  plays a role in the cell that transcends its purely
metabolic function as a methyl donor and metabolic intermediate (reviewed in ref. 26). changes in  xxxd3156xxx  levels modulate
proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, so its synthesis
needs to be carefully controlled. in this regard, the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd3156xxx  on mat ii activity has been well characterized
(12, 13, 48). our present observations represent a novel action
of  xxxd3156xxx  in the regulation of cellular physiology, this time
modulating its own production also through the regulation of
 xxxg1379xxx  mrna stability.
