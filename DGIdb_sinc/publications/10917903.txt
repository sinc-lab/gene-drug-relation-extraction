abstract previous studies reveal that supplementation of human diets with ␥- xxxd2490xxx  (gla) reduces the
generation of lipid mediators of inflammation and attenuates clinical symptoms of chronic inflammatory disorders
such as rheumatoid arthritis. however, we have shown that supplementation with this same fatty acid also causes
a marked increase in serum  xxxd208xxx  (aa) levels, a potentially harmful side effect. the objective of this study
was to design a supplementation strategy that maintained the capacity of gla to reduce lipid mediators without
causing elevations in serum aa levels. initial in vitro studies utilizing hep-g2 liver cells revealed that addition of
 xxxd2318xxx  (epa) blocked ⌬-5-desaturase activity, the terminal enzymatic step in aa synthesis. to test
the in vivo effects of a gla and epa combination in humans, adult volunteers consuming controlled diets
supplemented these diets with 3.0 g/d of gla and epa. this supplementation strategy significantly increased
serum levels of epa, but did not increase aa levels. epa and the elongation product of gla, dihomo-␥-linolenic
acid ( xxxd1886xxx ) levels in neutrophil glycerolipids increased significantly during the 3-wk supplementation period.
neutrophils isolated from volunteers fed diets supplemented with gla and epa released similar quantities of aa,
but synthesized significantly lower quantities of leukotrienes compared with their neutrophils before supplementation. this study revealed that a gla and epa supplement combination may be utilized to reduce the synthesis
of proinflammatory aa metabolites, and importantly, not induce potentially harmful increases in serum aa
levels. j. nutr. 130: 1925–1931, 2000.

␥- xxxd2490xxx  (gla)3 is an 18-carbon polyunsaturated
fatty acid of the (n-6) series. when given as a dietary supplement, this fatty acid has been shown to relieve the signs and
symptoms of chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis (andreassi et al. 1997,
kunkel et al. 1981, leventhal et al. 1993 and 1994, lovell et
al. 1981, morse et al. 1989, tate et al. 1989, zurier et al.
1996). many of the clinical effects of gla supplementation
have been attributed to its capacity to block the metabolism of
 xxxd208xxx  (aa) to bioactive eicosanoids. however, this
is a somewhat paradoxical finding because gla, via its metabolism by elongase and ⌬-5-desaturase activities, is a poten-

tial precursor of aa; thus, adding dietary gla might be
expected to increase aa levels with subsequent proinflammatory effects. recent in vitro and in vivo studies have begun to
resolve this paradox by demonstrating that inflammatory cells
such as human neutrophils contain the elongase but not the
⌬-5-desaturase activity, and thus dietary gla supplementation leads to the accumulation of dihomo-␥- xxxd2490xxx 
( xxxd1886xxx ) and not aa in cellular glycerolipids. importantly,
neutrophils from subjects supplemented with gla produce
less leukotriene b4 (ltb4) than they did before supplementation (johnson et al. 1997, ziboh and fletcher 1992). together,
these studies reveal that the endogenous elongase activity in
certain inflammatory cells can be utilized to synthesize close
structural analogs of aa (i.e.,  xxxd1886xxx ) from appropriate dietary precursors, and these analogs may then affect aa metabolism (chilton-lopez et al. 1996, johnson et al. 1997).
in contrast to neutrophils, gla supplementation can
markedly increase serum aa, suggesting that dietary gla in
circulation has the potential to be both elongated to  xxxd1886xxx 
and subsequently desaturated to aa. thus, in vivo gla
supplementation in humans attenuates aa metabolism in
certain inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, but can also

lead to the potentially adverse effect of increasing serum aa
levels. previous studies have suggested that the accumulation
of aa in serum can have important consequences in humans.
for example, aa has been shown to enhance the formation of
platelet-aggregating endoperoxides and thromboxanes (hamberg et al. 1974 and 1975, smith et al. 1974, willis 1974).
moreover, high levels of aa in humans result in an increased
tendency for the secondary irreversible phase of platelet aggregation (seyberth et al. 1975). in most cases, an increase in
sensitivity of platelets to aggregating stimuli is not desirable.
the observation that serum aa accumulates after gla
supplementation raises important concerns about the longterm effect of this dietary supplementation strategy (johnson
et al.1997). it also highlights the need to find dietary strategies
that will produce natural inhibitors (such as  xxxd1886xxx ) of aa
within inflammatory cells, thereby reducing the synthesis of
proinflammatory eicosanoids without increasing serum levels
of aa. we tested the hypothesis that the addition of the (n-3)
fatty acid product of the ⌬-5-desaturase reaction,  xxxd2318xxx  (epa), attenuates the in vitro and in vivo conversion of  xxxd1886xxx  to aa by nonneutrophil sources, thereby
reducing serum aa accumulation observed during gla supplementation.

dietary protocols. the protocols used were approved by the
institutional review board and written consent was obtained from
each volunteer before starting the study. healthy volunteers had
baseline interviews with a nutritionist for diet history and a review of
study procedures. height, weight, activity levels and usual eating
habits were assessed to determine energy needs and to eliminate
potentially noncompliant subjects. energy intake needs were established using the harris benedict equation with the addition of a
factor of 1.3–1.7 for activity level. all food consumed by subjects for
the 21-d outpatient period was prepared by the metabolic kitchen of
the wake forest university school of medicine general clinical
research center (gcrc) using a 5-d menu cycle prepared under
controlled, constant conditions. the nutritional composition of the
diet is given in table 1. subjects reported to the gcrc five times per
week to be weighed and receive their meals. subjects received daily
checklists of foods to be consumed and returned them with notations
of any deviations from the diet provided. regular contact and communication with the gcrc nutritionists were maintained, and minor modifications to the menus were made as needed to ensure
compliance. weights were monitored and energy intakes adjusted (in
increments of 418 kj) if a weight change of ⬎1 kg from baseline was
observed for three consecutive visits or total weight change exceeded
1.5 kg. all subjects maintained body weight within 1.5 kg of baseline
weight during the study as seen in table 2; only one subject required
adjustment of energy intake during the study (table 2). table 3
shows the composition of several minor  xxxd2154xxx  consumed during
the 5-d menu cycle as determined by negative ion chemical ionization gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (nici-gc/ms; see below). there were no adverse effects reported by any of the volunteers.

protocol a. healthy volunteers (n ⫽ 4; 2 men and 2 women;
ages ranging from 25 to 37 y) consumed the controlled diet (described
above). they took 10 capsules (5 capsules in the morning and 5
capsules in the evening) of borage oil (bio-efa) containing ⬃3.0 g
gla/d. blood was obtained, and serum and neutrophils were isolated
after an overnight fast, the morning before starting the supplementation and each week of the supplementation.
protocol b. healthy volunteers (n ⫽ 12; 5 women and 7 men;
ages ranging from 23 to 42 y) consumed the controlled diet (described
above) and were supplemented with oils enriched in gla (⬃3 g/d)
and epa (⬃3 g/d). specifically, they consumed 10 capsules/d (5
capsules in the morning and 5 capsules at night) of bio-efa and 5
capsules/d (3 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at night) of
concentrated fish oil (twin epa), for 21 d. nici-gc/ms (see
below) revealed that the twin epa capsule contained ⬃600 mg of
epa and ⬃280 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (dha). blood was
obtained, and serum and neutrophils isolated after an overnight fast,
the morning before supplementation, each week during the supplementation and 2 wk after ending the supplementation (washout).
analysis of serum lipids. venous blood (⬃2 ml) was taken from
each volunteer at each time point described above, and serum was
isolated as previously described (chilton et al. 1993). the lipids from
a 100-␮l aliquot of the serum were extracted by the method of bligh
and dyer (1959). trideuterated  xxxd3244xxx  (100 ng) and octadeuterated  xxxd208xxx  (100 ng) were added as internal standards to
the samples.  xxxd2154xxx  were cleaved from glycerolipids by base
hydrolysis [0.5 mol/l potassium hydroxide in methanol/water (3:1)
for 30 min at 60°c]. reactions were stopped by neutralizing the
mixture using 0.5 ml of 6 mol/l hcl. samples were then loaded onto
bakerbond octadecyl columns and fatty acid– enriched fractions were
extracted as previously described (chilton et al. 1993).  xxxd2154xxx 
were then converted to pentafluorobenzyl esters using 20% pentafluorobenzyl bromide and 20% diisopropylethylamine for 30 min at
40°c. quantities of  xxxd2154xxx  were then determined by nicigc/ms as described below.
analysis of fatty acid composition of neutrophil glycerolipids.
neutrophils were isolated from whole blood of each volunteer at each
time point and were suspended  xxxd1891xxx  ⫻ 109 cells/l in hbss containing calcium. mole quantities of  xxxd2154xxx  were determined as
previously described (chilton et al.1993). briefly, total lipids were
extracted by the method of bligh and dyer (1959). octadeuterated
 xxxd208xxx  and trideuterated  xxxd3244xxx  (100 ng each) were
added to samples as internal standards.  xxxd2154xxx  were hydrolyzed
from glycerolipids utilizing base hydrolysis, and  xxxd2154xxx  extracted
and derivatized as described above. quantities of  xxxd2154xxx  were then
determined by nici-gc/ms as described below.
analysis of products after neutrophil stimulation. isolated neutrophils were suspended in hbss containing calcium at a concentration of 10 ⫻ 109 cells/l. neutrophils were then stimulated by the
addition of ionophore a23187 (1 ␮mol/l) and reactions allowed to

proceed for 5 min. when analyzing the capacity of neutrophils to
release  xxxd2154xxx , reactions were terminated with methanol/chloroform (2:1, v/v). trideuterated  xxxd3244xxx  (100 ng) and octadeuterated arachidonic (100 ng) acid were added as internal standards.
mole quantities of  xxxd2154xxx  released were determined utilizing
nici-gc/ms as described below. when analyzing the capacity of
neutrophils to synthesize leukotrienes, reactions were terminated by
removing cells from supernatant fluids utilizing centrifugation (400
⫻ g, 5 min, 4°c). supernatant fluids were removed and acidified with
9%  xxxd2154xxx . pgb2 (250 ng) was added to each sample as an
internal standard before the  xxxd2154xxx  and eicosanoids were extracted with four volumes of ethyl acetate (2x). this extract was then
loaded onto an lc-18 reverse-phase narrowbore hplc column (25
cm ⫻ 2.1 mm) purchased from supelco (bellefonte, pa); the leukotrienes were eluted with a mobile phase of methanol/water/phosphoric acid (55:45:0.02, v/v/v, ph 5.6) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. after
5 min, the methanol composition of the mobile phase was increased
to 100% over 30 min. the areas under the uv peaks (at 270 nm)
corresponding to ltb4, ltb5, 6-trans isomers and 20-oh-ltb4 were
identified and compared with the peak area of pgb2 that was added
as an internal standard. mole quantities of leukotrienes were determined utilizing standard curves.
analysis of the fatty acid composition of the food samples from
the 5-d rotating menu. a total day’s food from each day of the menu
cycle was homogenized using a blender. lipids were extracted from
the 5-d liquefied preparation by the method of bligh and dyer (1959).
octadeuterated  xxxd208xxx  (100 ng) and trideuterated stearic
acid (100 ng) were added as internal standards.  xxxd2154xxx  were
hydrolyzed from glycerolipids by base hydrolysis, extracted and derivatized as described above. quantities of  xxxd2154xxx  were determined
by nici-gc/ms as described below.
analysis of the fatty acid composition of borage oil and fish oil
capsules. the contents of the capsules were suspended in methanol/
chloroform (1:1, v/v). octadeuterated  xxxd208xxx  and trideuterated  xxxd3244xxx  (100 ng each) were added as internal standards.
 xxxd2154xxx  were hydrolyzed from glycerolipids by base hydrolysis, and
 xxxd2154xxx  extracted and derivatized as described above. mole quantities of  xxxd2154xxx  were determined by nici-gc/ms.
in vitro fatty acid metabolism in hep-g2 cells. hep-g2 cells
(106) were cultured in 6 ml of dmem culture medium supplemented
with 1 ml/l penicillin ⫹ streptomycin, 1 ml/l fetal bovine serum
and 1 ml/l insulin ⫹ transferrin at 37°c in 5% co2. solvents were
removed from epa and  xxxd1886xxx  under a stream of nitrogen, and these
 xxxd2154xxx  were resuspended in dmem containing 1% fetal bovine
serum. this buffer solution was incubated with hep-g2 cells for 24 h
at  xxxd2154xxx  concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 ␮mol/l. after 24 h,
the media were removed and adherent cells washed (2x) with hbss
containing human  xxxg124xxx  (0.25g/l). hep-g2 cells were then
removed (rubber policeman) from flasks and suspended in hbss/
methanol/chloroform (1:2:1, v/v/v). lipids were extracted by the
method of bligh and dyer (1959) as described above. octadeuterated
 xxxd208xxx  (100 ng) and trideuterated  xxxd3244xxx  (100 ng)
were added as internal standards.  xxxd2154xxx  were removed from
glycerolipids by base hydrolysis, and  xxxd2154xxx  extracted and derivatized as described above. quantities of  xxxd2154xxx  were determined
by nici-gc/ms.
negative ion chemical ionization-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (nici-gc/ms). nici-gc/ms analysis was conducted on
a single-stage quadrapole mass spectrometer (hewlett-packard 5989;
greensboro, nc) as previously described (chilton et al. 1993). the
gas chromatography was performed on a hewlett-packard 5890 gc
using a 30-m db-17 fused silica column (spb-5; 0.25-mm film thickness; supelco). the initial column temperature was 60°c. the column was heated to 220°c at a rate of 40°c/min with a subsequent
increase in temperature to 280°c at a rate of 5°c/min. the injector
temperature was maintained at 250°c. each injection was performed
in the splitless mode. a volume of 1 ␮l from 200 ␮l of recovered
material dissolved in hexane was injected. helium was used as a
carrier gas. the pentafluorobenzyl esters were analyzed using selected
ion-recording techniques to monitor gla (m/z 277), la (m/z 279),
oa (m/z 281), epa (m/z 301),  xxxd1886xxx  (m/z 305), aa (m/z 303),

serum aa and  xxxd1886xxx  levels within 3 wk of the initiation of
gla ingestion. in contrast, the combination of epa with
gla did not increase serum aa levels (fig. 2, low panel),
suggesting that it is possible to block ⌬-5-desaturase in humans
with epa. however, the gla and epa combination markedly increased serum epa levels. after a 2-wk washout period,
epa levels returned to baseline levels. a previous study in our
laboratory demonstrated that aa and  xxxd1886xxx  levels increase
in response to gla supplementation and return to baseline
values after 2 wk (johnson et al. 1997). together, these data
suggest that the addition of epa to human diets containing
high levels of gla provides a means to block increases in
serum aa.
influence of the combination of gla and epa on the fatty

 xxxd1886xxx  and epa were significantly increased at wk 3 compared
with the baseline values (fig. 3). aa levels in neutrophil
lipids did not change. gla supplementation alone did not

results
influence of epa on ⌬-5-desaturase activity in hep-g2
cells. initial experiments in this study examined whether
epa, a ⌬-5-desaturase product, could inhibit the conversion of
 xxxd1886xxx  to aa in a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, hepg2. these hep-g2 cells exhibit morphological features of
mature hepatocytes (aden et al. 1979). moreover, this cell
line is a relevant experimental model for investigating fatty
acid metabolism of the human liver (angeletti and tacconi de
alaniz 1995). the addition of  xxxd1886xxx  to hep-g2 cells resulted in the conversion of  xxxd1886xxx  to aa. for example,
addition of 20 ␮mol/l  xxxd1886xxx  to the hep-g2 cells markedly
increased cellular aa levels. concomitant addition of epa
with a constant amount of  xxxd1886xxx  caused a dose-dependent
attenuation in the conversion of  xxxd1886xxx  to aa (fig. 1). epa
at 50 ␮mol/l inhibited aa formation from  xxxd1886xxx  (20
␮mol/l) by 50%. these data demonstrate the capacity of epa
to block ⌬-5-desaturase activity in isolated hepatocytes.
influence of the combination of gla and epa on the fatty
acid compositions of serum lipids. a concern with long-term
gla supplementation is that a marked increase in serum
levels of aa may occur. therefore, dietary strategies that
allow the accumulation of potential inhibitors of aa metabolism without increasing serum aa would be valuable. because epa inhibited ⌬-5-desaturase in hep-g2 cells, we determined whether epa could similarly suppress hepatic
conversion of  xxxd1886xxx  to aa in humans. two groups of volunteers consumed control diets (see subjects and methods)
and were supplemented with either gla (3.0 g/d) alone or a
combination of gla (3.0 g/d) and epa (3.0 g/d). figure 2

decrease in leukotrienes of the 4 series, there was an increase
in leukotriene b5 derived from released epa (fig. 6).
discussion
studies by several investigators have demonstrated that
dietary supplementation with gla has the potential to reduce
inflammation. this reduction in inflammation has been attributed to the capacity of the elongation product of gla,
 xxxd1886xxx , to block the synthesis of aa products and the capacity of  xxxd1886xxx  to be converted to oxidized products that have
anti-inflammatory activities (billah et al. 1985, chilton-lopez
et al. 1996, deluca et al. 1999, iversen et al. 1991 and 1992,
vanderhoek et al. 1980). our previous studies (chilton et al.

eicospentaenoic acid (epa). abbreviations: gla, ␥- xxxd2490xxx ;
 xxxd1886xxx , dihomo-␥- xxxd2490xxx ; aa,  xxxd208xxx .

1993, chilton-lopez et al. 1996, johnson et al.1996) and
those of ziboh and fletcher (1992) have demonstrated that
supplementation of low-to-moderate fat diets with gla markedly decreases the capacity of inflammatory cells such as human neutrophils to produce leukotrienes (johnson et al.1997).
we further demonstrated that the likely mechanism of inhibition by gla stems from its capacity to be elongated by an
endogenous elongase activity within the neutrophil to a close
structural analog of aa,  xxxd1886xxx  (fig. 7). however, neutrophils cannot further desaturate  xxxd1886xxx  to aa because they
lack ⌬-5-desaturase activity (chilton-lopez et al.1996). thus,
the endogenous elongase activity within inflammatory cells
can be utilized to synthesize close structural analogs of aa
(i.e.,  xxxd1886xxx ) from appropriate dietary precursors. it is postulated that these analogs affect aa metabolism, thereby mitigating clinical manifestations induced by aa metabolites.
a potentially important side effect of gla supplementation is elongation of gla to  xxxd1886xxx  and further desaturation
via ⌬-5-desaturase to aa by enzymes in the liver. this causes
a marked increase in serum aa levels. in a previous study of
aa supplementation in humans, similar increases in serum
aa levels were associated with an increase in the in vivo
aggregation of platelets (seyberth et al.1975). this increase in
platelet sensitivity raised concerns about potentially harmful
cardiovascular side effects and the long-term safety of any
dietary strategy that increases serum aa levels, including
those current formulations being sold in nutraceutical markets.
the current study was designed to determine whether dietary strategies could be designed that have the anti-inflammatory potential of gla without leading to increases in serum
aa. this was accomplished by the addition of the ⌬-5desaturase product of the (n-3) pathway, epa. initial in vitro
experiments demonstrated that epa had the capacity to block
⌬-5-desaturase activity in an isolated hepatocarcinoma cell
line. these experiments were followed by in vivo studies that
showed epa supplementation of human diets prevented the
accumulation of serum aa in response to gla without inhibiting accumulation of  xxxd1886xxx  in neutrophils. thus, both in
vivo and in vitro studies revealed that epa may act as an end
product inhibitor of the ⌬-5-desaturase.
we further examined the influence of the gla ⫹ epa
combination on leukotriene generation. the capacity of human neutrophils to release aa was not influenced by the gla
⫹ epa supplementation. in contrast, their capacity to generate leukotrienes (ltb4, 20-oh-ltb4 and related isomers) was

inhibited significantly (⬃40%) compared with neutrophils
from these same volunteers before supplementation. the inhibition observed in this study was greater than what has been
observed before for epa alone (chilton et al.1993). in contrast, the inhibition with epa/gla was somewhat less than
that seen in a previous study in our laboratory with gla alone
(johnson et al. 1997). however, the differences in leukotriene
generation in these studies were not powered sufficiently to
detect statistically significant differences and may be a function of biologic variability among the volunteers.
clinicians, patients, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical
companies are all increasingly utilizing natural products for the
treatment of clinical disorders. as this trend continues, it is
important that these products be both safe and effective.
overall, little attention has been paid to the potentially adverse effects of dietary supplements and specifically, dietary
fatty acid supplementation strategies. this study shows how a
potentially important complication, arising from supplementation with a simple fatty acid, can be avoided by using
appropriate fatty acid combinations. as the nutraceutical industry continues to experience explosive growth, it will be
increasingly important to understand the safety profiles of
dietary supplements and avoid complications that arise from
such supplements.
