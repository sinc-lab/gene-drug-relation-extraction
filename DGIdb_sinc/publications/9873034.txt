in primary sequence, gene chromosomal location, and activation by ca21 (4 – 6). a  xxxg1577xxx  isoform ( xxxg1577xxx ) that is
present in brain and skeletal muscle (7, 8), and an endothelial
nos isoform (enos) expressed in the vasculature or brain (9,
10) are dependent on calmodulin (cam) binding for activity,
which is reversible and occurs in response to elevated intracellular ca21. in contrast, a continuously active nos isoform
(inos) is expressed in cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines
or bacterial products (11), and is neither stimulated by ca21
nor blocked by cam antagonists due to its containing tightlybound cam (12). numerous pathologies are attributed to excess no production by inos (13–16) and have led to a quest for
specific inhibitors of this isoform. work has focused on a broad
range of molecules including substrate analogs, guanidine derivatives, thioureas, and heterocycles, with some specific inhibitors beginning to emerge (17–27).
although the nos isoforms differ regarding their primary
sequence and mode of expression, they all are bi-domain enzymes comprised of a c-terminal reductase domain that contains binding sites for nadph, fad, fmn, and cam, and an
n-terminal oxygenase domain that contains binding sites for
heme, tetrahydrobiopterin (h4b), and  xxxd220xxx  (5, 28 –31). the
nos heme shares characteristics with the heme in cytochromes p-450 in that it coordinates to the protein through a
cysteine thiolate (30 –32), can bind o2 as a sixth ligand (33),
and may directly participate in oxygen activation and product
formation (33–37). thus, as with the cytochromes p-450, the
nos heme represents a potential target for enzyme inhibition.
in fact, compounds that bind directly to the nos heme iron
such as co, no, cn, imidazole, and n-phenyl imidazoles all
inhibit no synthesis (22, 34, 38 – 40).
the noss are only active as homodimers (41– 43). for inos
(29) and possibly  xxxg1577xxx  and enos (44 – 46), only the oxygenase
domains of two subunits interact to form the dimer, with the
reductase domains attached as extensions that may destabilize
the dimer (47). both the oxygenase and reductase domain of
each nos isoform can fold and function independent of one
another (45– 47). for example, the inos oxygenase domain
(inosox, amino acids 1– 498) is expressed in escherichia coli as
a dimer, exhibits normal affinity toward  xxxd220xxx  and h4b, and
catalyzes no synthesis from the reaction intermediate n-hydroxy- xxxd220xxx  either in a h2o2-supported reaction or when supplied with nadph and its reductase domain (48 –50). a crystal
structure of dimeric inosox with  xxxd220xxx  and h4b bound has
been published (32).
full-length nos monomers isolated from mammalian cells
are devoid of h4b and heme, but contain bound fad and fmn,
functional nadph and cam binding sites, and can catalyze
electron transfer to artificial acceptors such as  xxxg569xxx  at
rates that match their respective dimeric forms (41, 42). work
with full-length inos and  xxxg1577xxx  monomers indicates that
their dimerization minimally requires that heme be inserted
into the protein during the dimerization reaction (41, 42, 51).

cytokine- xxxg1578xxx  (inos) is a
homodimeric enzyme that generates  xxxd2738xxx  (no)
and  xxxd2429xxx  from l-arginine ( xxxd220xxx ) and o2. the nterminal oxygenase domain (amino acids 1– 498; inosox) in each subunit binds heme,  xxxd220xxx , and tetrahydrobiopterin (h4b), is the site of no synthesis, and is
responsible for the dimeric interaction, which must occur to synthesize no. in both cells and purified systems,
inos dimer assembly is promoted by h4b,  xxxd220xxx , and
 xxxd220xxx  analogs. we examined the ability of imidazole and
n-substituted imidazoles to promote or inhibit dimerization of heme-containing inosox monomers, or to affect inos dimerization in cells. imidazole, 1-phenylimidazole,  xxxd1732xxx , and  xxxd2640xxx  all bound to the
inosox monomer heme iron. imidazole and 1-phenylimidazole promoted inosox dimerization, whereas  xxxd1732xxx  (30 mm) and  xxxd2640xxx  (15 mm) did not, and
instead inhibited dimerization normally promoted by
 xxxd220xxx  and h4b.  xxxd1732xxx  also bound to inosox
dimers in the absence of  xxxd220xxx  and h4b and caused their
dissociation. when added to cells expressing inos,  xxxd1732xxx  (50 mm) had no effect on inos protein expression but almost completely inhibited its dimerization
and consequent no synthesis over an 8-h culture period,
without affecting calmodulin interaction with inos.
thus, imidazoles can promote or inhibit dimerization of
inos both in vitro and in cells, depending on their structure. bulky imidazoles like  xxxd1732xxx  block no synthesis by inhibiting assembly of the inos dimer, revealing a new means to control cellular no synthesis.

experimental procedures

materials—interferon-g was a gift from genentech, south san francisco, ca. antibodies against inos and cam were from transduction
laboratories (lexington, ky) and upstate biotechnology inc. (lake
placid, ny). the enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) kit for immunodetection was from amersham international plc (little chalfon,
united kingdom). bacterial culture materials were purchased from
difco labs (detroit, mi) and becton dickinson microbiology systems
(cockeysville, md).  xxxd1732xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx  were purchased from
sigma, while  xxxd48xxx , 1-phenylimidazole, and 2-phenylimidazole were purchased from aldrich. mammalian cell culture materials
were purchased from life technologies inc. (gaithersburg, md), ampicillin was from  xxxd164xxx  (princeton, nj).  xxxd502xxx  and lysozyme were
from boehringer-mannheim gmbh (germany). ni21- xxxd2739xxx 
resin was from novagen inc. (madison, wi). gel filtration protein
standards were from bio-rad.  xxxd1732xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx  stock solutions were prepared in me2so, while all other imidazoles were dissolved in buffer.
cell culture and protein preparation—raw 264.7 macrophage cell
cultures (500 ml) were grown in spinner flasks and induced to express
inos by adding 10 units/ml interferon-g and 1 mg/ml e. coli lipopolysaccharide as previously detailed (41).  xxxd1732xxx  was added as a

2-ml me2so solution to each culture as described below. in some
cases, inos monomers and dimers were purified from the soluble raw
264.7 cell fraction by sequential chromatography on 29,59-adp sepharose and mono-q anion exchange columns using fast protein liquid
chromatography (41).
the oxygenase domain of inos (amino acids 1– 498, inosox) containing a 6-hisitidine c terminus was expressed in e. coli and purified
in the absence of  xxxd220xxx  and h4b essentially as detailed in siddhanta et
al. (60), while full-length inos containing a 6-histidine tag at its n
terminus was expressed in e. coli and purified in the absence of  xxxd220xxx 
and h4b as described in wu et al. (61). the purified inosox and
full-length inos proteins were 70 – 80% dimeric as isolated and were
dissociated into monomers with urea according to previous methods (47,
60). briefly, inosox was diluted to 3 mm in 40 mm hepes, ph 7.5,
containing 10% glycerol, 3 mm dtt, and 5 m urea at 4 °c. after 1 h, this
solution (;1 ml) was sequentially dialyzed at 4 °c against 200 ml of the
same buffer containing 5 m urea for 90 min, against 200 ml of the same
buffer containing 2 m urea for 4 h, and against 200 ml the same buffer
containing 0.1 m urea overnight. the same procedure was used for
full-length inos except 2.5 m urea was used to dissociate the dimer and
intermediate dialysis with 2 m urea was omitted. these procedures
resulted in preparations that contained 60 – 80% monomer and 20 – 40%
dimer (percentages reflect distribution of inos protein mass) as determined by gel filtration chromatography. the urea-generated inos
monomers contained heme but no h4b (47, 53) and were used within 1
day of their preparation.
no synthesis activity—the no synthesis activity of activated cell
cultures or of soluble cell supernatants was estimated using the colorimetric griess assay for nitrite as described previously (41). culture
fluid was analyzed directly for nitrite. no synthesis activity of cell
supernatants or column fractions was determined in 100-ml incubations
containing aliquots of cell supernatants or column fractions and 40 mm
 xxxd3449xxx , ph 7.8, 1 mm nadph, 2 mm  xxxd220xxx , 3 mm dtt, protease
inhibitors, and 4 mm each of fad, fmn, and h4b as described previously (41). incubations were run for 60 min at 37 °c prior to analyzing
for nitrite. no synthesis activity of purified full-length inos was determined using the spectrophotometric oxyhemoglobin assay. cuvette
samples (350 ml) contained inos, 5 mm oxyhemoglobin, 0.3 mm dtt, 1
mm  xxxd220xxx , 0.5 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , 1300 units/ml catalase,
and 150 units/ml superoxide dismutase in 40 mm epps, ph 7.6. reactions were initiated by adding 100 mm nadph and the rate of no
synthesis was measured at 401 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 38
mm21 cm21.
spectroscopy—optical spectra were recorded at room temperature on
a hitachi u-2110 spectrophotometer as detailed in sennequier and
stuehr (56). spectra were collected and processed using spectracalc
software (galactic industries corp., salem, nh). titrations of n-substituted imidazoles were performed by adding 3-ml aliquots of concentrated stock solutions (giving a final concentration range of 1–50 mm
and 1–20 mm, respectively, for  xxxd1732xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx ) to cuvettes
containing 1 ml of bis- xxxd3449xxx , ph 7.6, 1 mm dtt, inosox, and
 xxxd220xxx , or h4b as stated in the text. spectra were collected after each
addition. binding constants were derived from double-reciprocal plots
of the absorbance difference (peak to trough in the difference spectra)
versus the additive concentration.
dimer/monomer detection and formation—inos dimer and monomer in supernatants of lysed cells or purified inosox samples were
estimated by fractionating 100 ml of sample on a superdex 200 gel
filtration column at 4 °c. the column was run at 0.5 ml/min with 40 mm
 xxxd1593xxx  buffer, ph 7.4, containing 2 mm dtt, 10% glycerol,
and 200 mm nacl. under these conditions, dimer does not dissociate
into monomer nor do monomers form dimers.2 for samples containing
inosox, eluted protein was monitored at 280 nm and the peaks were
assigned to be dimer or monomer based on the elution volumes of
protein standards and authentic inosox monomer and dimer (47). the
dimer-monomer distribution in inosox samples was estimated based
on relative peak heights. for cell supernatants, aliquots of each column
fraction were subject to sds-page, proteins were transferred onto a
nytran membrane, and inos was detected using an anti-inos polyclonal antibody as detailed in albakri and stuehr (54). the sds-page
used a gradient of 5–20% acrylamide which allowed us to probe the
membrane for cam (17 kda) as well as for inos (130 kda). after inos
bands were visualized and quantitated by scanning densitometry, the
membrane was stripped of the antibody directed against inos and

the heme-containing nos monomer may be an intermediate
on the path toward forming a stable dimer (52), and although it
does not accumulate in mammalian cells containing h4b and
 xxxd220xxx  (41), it can be generated in vitro by dissociating purified
inos dimers with urea (47, 53). dimerization of inos monomers is also stimulated by h4b and  xxxd220xxx  (41, 47, 53) and is
inhibited in cells by no, which interferes with heme insertion
into the monomers (54). dimerization activates inos in part by
enabling electron transfer between enzyme flavin and heme
prosthetic groups (55), and by facilitating productive binding of
substrate and h4b (41, 49).
because dimer assembly is critical for no synthesis, it is
a potential target for therapeutic intervention. a study of
inos dimerization as promoted by  xxxd220xxx  showed that its
effect was stereospecific but not unique, because several larg and guanidine analogs that bind to the inos dimer also
promoted dimer assembly (41, 56). two substrate analogs
that exhibit greater affinity toward the inos dimer than
v
 xxxd220xxx , n -amino- xxxd220xxx  and  xxxd1641xxx  (21, 24), did not
promote dimer assembly, suggesting they might function as
antagonists. however, they were incapable of blocking dimer
assembly in the presence of excess  xxxd220xxx  (56), consistent with
their sharing a common binding site but being generally unable
to bind to inos monomers (32, 48, 49). this suggests that
substrate analogs have little inherent capacity to block inos
dimerization.
on the basis of these considerations, we tested if imidazoles
might positively or negatively influence inos dimer assembly.
because imidazoles bind to the nos heme iron, their binding
should not depend on nos dimeric structure, but simply on
whether heme is incorporated into the protein. in fact, the
crystal structure of a heme-containing inosox monomer shows
that two molecules of imidazole can bind within the monomer’s
distal heme pocket (57), one coordinating to the heme iron and
the other binding to the carboxylate of glu-371, which also
binds the guanidino nitrogens of  xxxd220xxx  (32, 48). we therefore
examined the ability of imidazole and n1-substituted imidazoles to promote or antagonize the dimerization of full-length
inos and inosox monomers, and compared results to those
obtained with  xxxd220xxx , h4b, or  xxxd48xxx , which are all
known to stabilize the nos dimer or promote its assembly
without binding to the heme iron (56, 58). we found that
imidazoles can promote or inhibit inos dimerization depending on their structure, and act through a mechanism that
involves binding to the heme iron. on this basis, we characterize an antifungal imidazole as a potent inhibitor of inos dimer
assembly both in a purified system and in cultured cells.

study.

results

the structures of the substituted imidazoles and indazole
used in this study are depicted in fig. 1. the ability of imidazole, phenylimidazoles, and  xxxd48xxx  to bind to a hemecontaining inosox monomer and affect dimerization was investigated by incubating monomers with each compound and
monitoring their binding and dimerization over a 40-min period with uv/visible spectroscopy and gel filtration chromatography. the inosox preparation used here was initially ;70%
monomeric based on gel filtration (data not shown) and in the
presence of dtt exhibited a split soret absorbance peak at 378
and 459 nm (fig. 2a), indicative of a dtt thiolate coordinating
as a sixth heme ligand to the ferric inosox monomer and
residual dimer (53, 59). adding imidazole to the inos monomer preparation caused immediate conversion to a species
exhibiting a single soret band with absorbance maximum at
429 nm (fig. 2a), indicating that imidazole quickly displaced
dtt as a sixth ligand to the heme iron in the inosox monomer
and residual dimer. the spectrum of imidazole-bound inosox
did not change over the subsequent 40-min incubation period.
in contrast, an inosox monomer incubated with  xxxd220xxx  and
h4b for 40 min underwent gradual spectral changes to generate a species with soret maxima at 398 nm (fig. 2a, inset),
which is the typical spectral change observed during dimerization of inosox monomers promoted by  xxxd220xxx  and h4b (47), and
indicates gradual displacement of dtt from the ferric heme as
dimerization progresses. incubation of inosox monomers with
 xxxd48xxx  also caused a gradual spectral change that
indicated displacement of dtt, and a high degree of dimerization (data not shown).
a significant portion of imidazole-bound inosox monomer
assembled into a dimer over the 40-min incubation period (fig.
2b). the amount of dimer present in the sample incubated with
imidazole exceeded the amount of dimer present in the sample
incubated with dtt alone,3 and was comparable to that ob3
molecules which coordinate to the inos heme iron do not necessarily promote dimer assembly (for example, dtt).

reprobed using a mouse antibody directed against bovine cam by a
standard procedure (12).
dimerization of inosox or full-length inos monomers was performed by incubating the protein (1 mm) at room temperature in 40 mm
hepes buffer, ph 7.5, containing 3 mm dtt, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum
albumin and  xxxd220xxx , h4b, and/or compounds as noted in the text. the
inosox dimer-monomer distribution was estimated by fractionating
100 ml of the incubate at various times on the superdex gel filtration
column as noted above. to monitor dimerization of inosox spectroscopically, the reaction was carried out in  xxxd3426xxx -ml cuvette and optical
spectra were recorded between 250 and 700 nm every 10 min. dimerization of full-length inos was followed by assaying no synthesis
activity of aliquots removed at indicated times.

tained for monomers incubated with  xxxd220xxx  and h4b (fig. 2b).
spectral and dimerization results obtained using 1-phenylimidazole were identical to those obtained with imidazole (data not
shown), indicating that a phenyl substituent at the n1 position
has no adverse effect on either heme binding or dimerization.
in contrast, incubating inosox monomers with 2-phenylimidazole did not result in spectral change or dimerization (data
not shown), consistent with 2-phenylimidazole binding poorly
to heme proteins due to a steric interaction between the phenyl
ring and porphyrin (22).
the rate of inos dimerization in the presence of imidazole
was investigated using urea-generated heme-containing monomers of full-length inos and assaying recovery of no synthesis, which is a dimer-specific activity used to measure inos
dimerization (41, 47, 53). as shown in fig. 3, there was an
increase in no synthesis activity within the first 20 min of
incubation followed by a more gradual increase. this time
course is similar to that observed for inos dimerization in
response to  xxxd220xxx  and h4b (47, 49, 53), and suggests that
dimerization follows binding of imidazole to the heme iron,
which occurs within seconds after mixing. recovery of no
synthesis was also associated with an increase in the proportion of dimer from 30 to 70% over the course of the imidazole
incubation as determined by gel filtration chromatography of
the 0 and 180-min samples (data not shown). we conclude that
imidazole and small n1-substituted imidazoles can promote
dimer assembly after binding to the heme iron. this differs
from  xxxd220xxx , h4b, or  xxxd48xxx , which promote dimer assembly without binding to the heme iron.
we then investigated if larger n1-substituted imidazoles
would bind to inosox monomer and affect dimer assembly.
addition of  xxxd1732xxx  (30 mm) or  xxxd2640xxx  (15 mm) led to an
immediate spectral change identical to that obtained when
imidazole was added (data not shown), indicating that these
bulky imidazoles bind rapidly to the monomer heme iron. the
affinity of the inosox monomer heme for  xxxd1732xxx  and
 xxxd2640xxx  was determined by perturbation difference spectrophotometry (shown for  xxxd1732xxx  in fig. 4a). the binding
constants derived from double-reciprocal plots of spectral
change versus wavelength were 7.3 6 1.0 mm for  xxxd1732xxx 
(fig. 4b) and 12 6 0.4 mm for  xxxd2640xxx  (data not shown). the
constant for  xxxd1732xxx  binding to inosox is in agreement
with its inhibitory constant for no production by stimulated
hepatocytes (13 mm) (62). we conclude the inosox monomer
heme can bind large n1-substituted imidazoles with high affinity, consistent with the monomer containing a relatively
open distal heme pocket (57).
gel filtration analysis of inosox monomers after incubation
with either  xxxd1732xxx  or  xxxd2640xxx  for 40 min showed that
it remained monomeric in both cases (fig. 5, top horizontal
row), indicating that these bulky imidazoles did not promote
dimer assembly. we therefore examined their ability to antagonize  xxxd220xxx - and h4b-promoted dimerization. monomers were
preincubated for 10 min either with buffer alone or containing
various concentrations of  xxxd1732xxx  or  xxxd2640xxx , and then
exposed to 1 mm  xxxd220xxx  and 10 mm h4b to promote dimerization,
which was assayed after an additional 10 and 40 min incubation. in the absence of  xxxd1732xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx , significant
dimer assembly occurred within 10 min of incubation with
 xxxd220xxx  and h4b and generated ;90% dimer by 40 min (fig. 5,
first vertical row).  xxxd1732xxx  or  xxxd2640xxx  inhibited dimer
assembly as promoted by  xxxd220xxx /h4b in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 5), with  xxxd2640xxx  being somewhat more
effective than  xxxd1732xxx . in cases where little or no dimerization occurred (30 mm  xxxd1732xxx  or 15 mm  xxxd2640xxx ),

fig. 3. time course of dimerization promoted by imidazole. a
full-length inos monomer preparation (1 mm) was incubated in buffer
containing dtt and 3 mm imidazole. aliquots were removed at the
times indicated and assayed immediately for no synthesis activity. the
data shown is representative of three similar experiments.

dimerization (see fig. 2a, inset) was not observed, whereas in
cases of partial dimerization (for example,  xxxd1891xxx  or 20 mm
 xxxd1732xxx ) we observed a time-dependent increase in absorbance centered at 396 nm, consistent with some h4b- and l-argpromoted dimerization and displacement of  xxxd1732xxx  (fig.
6).
we next investigated whether  xxxd1732xxx  or  xxxd2640xxx 
could dissociate an inosox dimer4 that had or had not been
preincubated with  xxxd220xxx  plus h4b. dimer not exposed to  xxxd220xxx 
and h4b bound  xxxd1732xxx  (15 mm) or  xxxd2640xxx  (30 mm)
rapidly, as judged by an immediate spectral change from the
split soret peak to a single peak centered at 429 nm (data not
shown; identical to that observed for imidazole in fig. 2a).
their binding was associated with subsequent conversion of
dimer to monomer over a 40-min incubation as determined by
gel filtration (fig. 7, traces a-c). in contrast, inosox dimer

that had been preincubated with  xxxd220xxx  and h4b was unable to
bind  xxxd1732xxx  or  xxxd2640xxx , as judged by a lack of spectral
change (data not shown), and also did not significantly dissociate into monomer over a 40-min incubation (fig. 7, trace d).
thus,  xxxd1732xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx  only bound to (and dissociated) dimeric inosox in the absence of  xxxd220xxx  plus h4b.
on the basis of the above data, we tested if  xxxd1732xxx 
would block assembly of dimeric inos in the raw 264.7
macrophage cell line. in a typical experiment, a 500-ml spinning cell culture was made 50 mm in  xxxd1732xxx , incubated for
30 min, then induced to express inos by adding lipopolysaccharide and interferon-g and incubated for an additional 8 h
before harvesting and cell lysis. control cultures received
me2so alone but were otherwise identically activated and processed. the nitrite concentration in the control culture increased from 2 to 30 mm over the 8-h induction period (fig. 8),
consistent with induced expression of active dimeric inos, but
the nitrite level did not increase in the culture given  xxxd1732xxx . cell supernatants prepared from representative matched
control and  xxxd1732xxx -treated cultures (500 ml each) contained 28 and 23 mg of soluble protein, respectively, indicating
that  xxxd1732xxx  caused little or no cell lysis under these
conditions. supernatant prepared from the clotrimazoletreated culture displayed a no synthesis specific activity that
was 6-fold lower than the control supernatant (0.38 versus 2.3
nmol of nitrite/min/mg of protein, respectively), but contained a
similar amount of inos protein as the control as judged by
western analysis (data not shown), consistent with corresponding observations in activated hepatocytes (62). thus, the  xxxd1732xxx -treated culture contained inos in a predominantly
inactive form.
inactive inos could arise from  xxxd1732xxx  inhibiting dimer
assembly, or alternatively, by  xxxd1732xxx  inhibiting cam
binding to inos (63, 64), which would likely prevent its proper
folding (61). we differentiated between these two possibilities
by determining inos dimer-monomer ratios in the cell lysates
and checking whether cam was associated to inos. the control activated supernatant (fig. 9, panel a) contained both
dimeric and monomeric inos in relatively equal proportion,
consistent with previous reports (41, 54), whereas the  xxxd1732xxx -treated supernatant (fig. 9, panel b) predominantly contained monomeric inos. scanning densitometry estimated the
dimer-monomer ratios to be 45:55 and 15:85 in each case,

zole-treated cells), as is typically observed for inos in denaturing gels (12, 61). measurement of no synthesis activity in
each gel filtration fraction (fig. 9, panel d) confirmed that
much less inos dimer was present in the supernatant from
 xxxd1732xxx -treated cells. we also checked for inos-associated
cam by determining the  xxxg569xxx  reductase activity of
inos monomer purified from  xxxd1732xxx -treated cells. monomer reductase activity in the absence or presence of added
ca21/cam was 2.0 6 0.3 and 3.1 6 0.5 mol of  xxxg569xxx 
reduced/min/mmol of inos, respectively, similar to the value
reported for inos monomers purified from conventional cultures (2.5 6 0.4 mol of  xxxg569xxx  reduced/min/mmol; ref.
41). we conclude that  xxxd1732xxx  inhibited inos dimer assembly in the cells without significantly preventing cam binding to inos.

monomer were incubated 40 min either in buffer alone (upper trace in
control column) or in buffer plus the indicated concentrations of  xxxd2640xxx  or  xxxd1732xxx . six other samples were first incubated 10 min
in buffer containing various concentrations of  xxxd1732xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx , and then had 1 mm  xxxd220xxx  and 10 mm h4b added to induce
dimerization. the traces are the elution profiles (a280) of aliquots removed from each sample at the indicated time and run on a superdex
gel filtration column. traces are aligned vertically and represent absorbance of the column eluate versus time. in each trace the inosox

our data show that imidazoles can positively or negatively
regulate inos dimer assembly. small molecules like imidazole
and 1-phenylimidazole promoted inos dimerization, whereas
bulky imidazoles like  xxxd1732xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx  did not, and
instead inhibited inos dimerization both in a purified system
and in cultured cells. their ability to block inos dimer assembly was unexpected and may suggest new strategies to control
no synthesis in cells.
how small molecules influence nos dimer assembly is not
clear. outside of a few cell culture studies (54, 65, 66), our
current understanding is based on work with purified nos
proteins or subcellular preparations. some general features
have emerged. for example, various derivatives of  xxxd220xxx  and
guanidine, various pteridines,  xxxd2060xxx , and  xxxd48xxx  all promote nos subunit dimerization (41, 47, 51, 56,
67) or stabilize the dimer (42, 43, 58). this suggests structural
constraints are minimal, and the promoting effect is not limited
to molecules acting as substrates or cofactors for no synthesis.
the active molecules noted above all bind to dimeric nos
isoforms with moderate to good affinity, but appear to bind
poorly or not at all to nos monomers, suggesting their binding
sites are incompletely formed in the monomer. in addition,
while most of these molecules seem to bind near the distal
heme pocket of nos, they do not ligate directly to the heme

although loose dimers have not been observed in mammalian cells,
all nos form a loose heme-containing dimer when overexpressed in e.

iron, and instead bind through interactions with the protein.
when molecules of this type are added to heme-containing
inos monomers, they cause a gradual shift to five-coordinate
high-spin heme that proceeds according to the tempo of inos
dimerization, as determined independently by monitoring protein fluorescence and catalytic changes associated with dimerization (47, 58). together, these features support a mechanism
in which nos subunits first interact reversibly to form a loose
dimer before the promoter molecules bind.5 subsequent promoter molecule binding then stabilizes the dimeric structure
and drives the monomer-dimer equilibrium toward stable
dimer (42, 52).
our current results suggest that imidazoles may not function
by this mechanism, but instead affect dimerization by binding
directly to the inos monomer heme iron. this possibility is
supported by the immediate and complete binding of imidazole
when it was added to inos monomers, the rate at which
dimerization occurred when imidazole was present at a concentration approximately 100 times kd, and the fact that imidazole
remained bound to the heme after the dimer had formed. its
binding to the monomer heme appears critical, because dimerization is not promoted by imidazoles that cannot bind to heme
(i.e. 2-phenylimidazole). thus, two means for promoting inos
dimerization appear possible: one involves subunit dimeric interaction as an initial step followed by promoter binding to
stabilize the dimeric structure (for example, h4b and  xxxd220xxx );
while the other may involve promoter binding as an initial
event followed by productive subunit interaction (imidazole).
both events may cause a common change in inos structure
that stabilizes the dimeric form.
 xxxd1732xxx  bound immediately to an inosox monomer or
to a  xxxd220xxx - and h4b-free dimer, but it was unable to bind to a
h4b- and  xxxd220xxx -saturated dimer. this provides further evidence that the distal heme pockets of an inos monomer or
h4b- and  xxxd220xxx -free dimer are similar in being exposed to the
solvent and able to accommodate large heme iron ligands like
 xxxd1732xxx  or dtt. bound h4b and  xxxd220xxx  excludes these
bulky ligands. because  xxxd1732xxx  could only dissociate inosox dimers with which it formed a heme-iron complex, it

likely affects inos quaternary structure after binding to the
heme iron, like the smaller imidazoles.
a scheme that incorporates  xxxd1732xxx  (and  xxxd2640xxx )
inhibition into a current model for inos dimer assembly (52) is
illustrated in fig. 10. heme-free inos monomers (inosm)
must incorporate heme (fe) in order to dimerize (41, 42).
heme-containing inos partitions in a monomer-loose dimer
equilibrium (inosmfe n inosdfe). h4b and  xxxd220xxx , if present,
can bind to the dimer and drive formation of stable, active
inos dimers (inosdfe(arg, h4b)).  xxxd1732xxx  reversibly
binds to the heme iron of a monomer and prevents its dimerization; it can also reversibly bind to the heme in a loose dimer
and cause it to dissociate. both processes lead to monomer
accumulation. occupancy of the distal heme pocket by  xxxd1732xxx  versus h4b plus  xxxd220xxx  appears to be mutually exclusive. this equilibrium binding model is consistent with  xxxd1732xxx  slowing inosox dimerization in response to  xxxd220xxx 
and h4b (fig. 5), rather than making it completely impossible.
how do bulky imidazoles like  xxxd1732xxx  prevent inos
dimerization at the molecular level? that  xxxd1732xxx  binds to
inosox monomer is consistent with crystal structures that
reveal an open heme pocket in the monomer (57). computer
modeling of a  xxxd1732xxx  molecule bound to the heme of an
inosox monomer or dimer predicts extensive collisions between  xxxd1732xxx ’s phenyl moieties and inosox b-strands 8b
and 9b, which are located above the heme. modeling also shows
that the phenyl groups do not extend far enough out of the
pocket to directly contact the dimer interface region.6 thus,
distortion of inos b-strands 8b and 9b is likely to occur upon
binding  xxxd1732xxx , which may perturb nearby structural
elements that participate in forming the dimer interface.
the function we propose for  xxxd1732xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx  in
fig. 10 differs from their other known effects. for example,
 xxxd1732xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx  inhibit cytochrome p450 catalysis
(69), notably in the course of oxidation of nv-hydroxy- xxxd220xxx 
(70). this occurs because  xxxd1732xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx  are hydrophobic enough to enter the p450 active site, which allows

fig. 9. effect of  xxxd1732xxx  on expressed inos dimer-monomer ratio, inos-associated cam, and no synthesis activity in
cells. supernatants of cell homogenates were prepared from the  xxxd1732xxx -treated or me2so-treated interferon-g and lipopolysaccharide-activated raw 264.7 cultures. 1 mg of protein from each supernatant was size-fractionated on a superdex column and the column

panels a and b show the western blot analysis of full-length inos
(130,000 mr band) in the column fractions of me2so- and clotrimazoletreated supernatants, respectively. fractions were designated to contain inos dimers or monomers based on the estimated molecular
weight of each fraction and by comparison to purified inos and protein
standards. panel c shows the western blot analysis after washing and
reprobing the blot of panel b ( xxxd1732xxx -treated cells) with an anticam antibody, and indicates the fractions containing cam (17,000 mr)
associated with inos (12). panel d indicates the no synthesis activity
of each supernatant gel filtration fraction from  xxxd1732xxx -treated
cells (open squares) and me2so-treated cells (filled squares). experiments shown are representative of two to four experiments.

tissues like lung epithelium continuously express inos (75),
and cellular assembly of dimer is sufficiently slow (66) to make
inos susceptible to  xxxd1732xxx  inhibition. it remains to be
seen whether cellular assembly of  xxxg1579xxx  isoforms is
also blocked by bulky imidazoles, or if structural analogs with
specificity toward a particular isoform can be developed.

fig. 10. model for  xxxd1732xxx  (clot) inhibition of inos
dimer assembly. following insertion of heme into an inos monomer
(inosmfe),  xxxd1732xxx  can bind to the heme iron in the monomer or
loosely formed dimer, and this inhibits formation of an  xxxd220xxx - and
h4b-containing stable dimer (inosdfe(arg, h4b)). see text for details.

their imidazole nitrogen to bind to the heme iron and prevent
substrate access and o2 binding. a similar mechanism cannot
operate in an active inos dimer, which by virtue of its bound
h4b and  xxxd220xxx  excludes bulky imidazoles from the active site.
 xxxd1732xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx  are also known to inhibit cam
binding to receptor proteins (63, 64) and to  xxxg1577xxx  at higher
concentrations (22). however, our dimerization experiments
utilized inosox, which does not have a cam-binding site.
significantly,  xxxd1732xxx  also inhibited dimerization of fulllength inos in cells that were actively engaged in inos protein synthesis, leading to accumulation of inos monomers in
the  xxxd1732xxx -treated cells and a lack of no synthesis. the
effect of  xxxd1732xxx  on cellular inos dimer assembly is striking if one considers that blocking no synthesis during inos
expression normally increases the proportion of dimer from 50
to 90% of the total inos (54). our data argue for a heme-based
mode of action for  xxxd1732xxx  in the cells. for example, the
 xxxd1732xxx -treated cells grew normally and expressed a normal amount of protein, confirming it is not toxic at the concentration used (62, 71). immunochemical and catalytic data indicated that inos monomers from  xxxd1732xxx -treated cells still
contained a normal amount of bound cam. this is consistent
with  xxxd1732xxx  being unable to dissociate cam from purified
inos dimer or inhibit its no synthesis when added to the
assay system (12, 72). the high affinity of inos toward cam
(12) likely constrains  xxxd1732xxx  to interact primarily in a
heme-dependent manner. our findings are in apparent conflict
with bogle and vallance (71), who report to have purified
cam-free inos from cells treated with econazole, a structural
relative of  xxxd2640xxx . whether structural differences allow
econazole to function through a cam-based mechanism deserves further study.
although  xxxd1732xxx  appears to inhibit cellular inos assembly through a heme-based mechanism, the exact point
where inhibition occurs is still unclear. for example,  xxxd1732xxx  could possibly affect events upstream from dimerization
that control heme availability or insertion into inos monomers. indeed, inos monomers which accumulated in the  xxxd1732xxx -treated cells were heme-free, suggesting  xxxd1732xxx 
affects heme incorporation into inos. heme-free inos monomers also accumulate in cells actively generating no, because
no apparently blocks heme insertion (54). in any case, our
current data indicate that cellular assembly of active inos is
remarkably sensitive to  xxxd1732xxx , and in principle may be
sensitive to any bulky imidazole that can bind to the monomer
heme iron.
 xxxd1732xxx  will likely inhibit inos dimerization in animal
cells only when it is present during active inos protein synthesis and dimer assembly. this is because  xxxd1732xxx  cannot
bind to the heme iron of an assembled inos dimer that has
already incorporated h4b and  xxxd220xxx , and almost all animal
cells and cell lines synthesize h4b and take in  xxxd220xxx  (73).
nevertheless, cytokine induction of inos is long lasting (74),
