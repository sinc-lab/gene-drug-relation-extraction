abstract
background: rheumatoid arthritis (ra) has been
associated with significant morbidity and economic
burden. traditional pharmacotherapy (eg, nsaids,
corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
[dmards]) can be inadequate in controlling symptoms and disease progression.  xxxd52xxx  is the first
selective co-stimulation modulator approved by the
us food and drug administration for the management of ra. it is a fusion protein developed to modulate the t-cell co-stimulatory signal that is mediated
through the cd28- xxxg396xxx /86 pathway.
objective: the objective of this manuscript was to
review the clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic properties, tolerability, and
clinical efficacy of  xxxd52xxx .
methods: medline and international pharmaceutical abstracts were searched through june and
may, respectively, of 2006 using the term  xxxd52xxx  or
 xxxg544xxx -ig. all prospective, randomized, phase ii and
iii trials, and their extension phases, were included.
results: phase ii and iii clinical trials found that
 xxxd52xxx , at a dose of 10 mg/kg administered as a
short iv infusion in combination with dmards, was
associated with significant clinical benefit in patients
with active ra. after 6 months of treatment, the
american college of rheumatology (acr) criteria for
20% clinical improvement (acr20 response) was attained in 41.9% to 67.9% of patients who received
 xxxd52xxx  compared with 19.5% to 39.7% of patients
who received placebo (p < 0.001). the percentages of
patients achieving the acr criteria for 50% and 70%
clinical improvement (acr50 and acr70) were
20.3% to 39.9% and 10.2% to 19.8%, respectively,
in the groups that received  xxxd52xxx  compared with

3.8% to 16.8% and 1.5% to 6.5%, respectively, in
the patients who received placebo (p -- 0.03 and p <
0.001). additionally,  xxxd52xxx  was found to improve
disease activity, physical function, pain, and healthrelated quality of life (hrqol). the most commonly
reported adverse effects associated with  xxxd52xxx 
treatment were headache (18.2%), upper respiratory
tract infection (12.7%), nasopharyngitis (11.5 %), and
nausea (11.5 %). the incidences of infections and serious infections were higher in the group that received
 xxxd52xxx  compared with patients who received placebo (53.8% vs 48.3% and 3.0% vs 1.9%, respectively;
p not reported). no significant between-group differences in mortality were found.
conclusions: available evidence suggests that  xxxd52xxx  was effective in controlling symptoms and improving h r q o l in patients with active ra and an
inadequate response to dmard therapy. the most
commonly reported adverse effects associated with
 xxxd52xxx  treatment were headache, upper respiratory
infection, nausea, and nasopharyngitis. additional trials are needed to determine the long-term safety profile of this agent and whether the clinical benefits of
 xxxd52xxx  found in the current clinical trials will be
sustained over time. (clin ther. 2006;28:1764-1778)

introduction
rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a chronic, inflammatory,
systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by symmetric inflammation of the synovial joints, which
leads to progressive erosion of bone and cartilage. 1
the incidence of ra in the united states is - 1 % of the
adult population, with women affected 3-fold more
frequently than men. 2 ra results in >9 million physician visits and >250,000 hospitalizations/y, with an average medical care cost of $5919/patient per year. 1,3,4
controlling joint damage, preventing loss of function, and decreasing pain are the primary goals of
managing ra. 1 currently, the pharmacotherapeutic
management of patients with ra consists of nsaids
and/or corticosteroids to control symptoms, in combination with nonbiological (eg, methotrexate,  xxxd2301xxx ,  xxxd3255xxx ,  xxxd2450xxx ) and/or biological (eg, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, anakinra)
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards) to
control disease progression. 1 despite the success of currently available treatment options, up to 25% of patients treated with methotrexate and up to 15% of
patients treated with a biological dmard do not attain adequate control of the disease, s in addition, up
to 30% of patients managed with a biological dmard
discontinue therapy secondary to lack of efficacy or
adverse effects,s
 xxxd52xxx , also known as  xxxg544xxx -ig, was approved in december 2005 by the us food and drug
administration and is the first selective co-stimulation
modulator that inhibits t-cell activation. this approach targets early immunomodulation of the pathways that contribute to inflammation and joint
destruction from ra. the objective of this manuscript
was to review the clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, tolerability,
and clinical efficacy of  xxxd52xxx .
materials and methods
we conducted a search for englishqanguage articles
and abstracts in international pharmaceutical abstracts
(1971-may 2006) and medline (1966-june 2006)
using the medical subject headings (mesh) 6 term
 xxxd52xxx  or  xxxg544xxx -ig with limitations set to distinguish humans with ra participating in clinical trials.
all prospective, randomized, phase ii and phase ill
trials and their extension phases were included.
bibliographies of clinical trials were reviewed for additional references. abstracts from meetings, includ-

mg those of the american college of rheumatology
(acr) and european league against rheumatism
(eular), were also reviewed.
res u lts
the review of the literature identified 4 phase ii 7-1°
and 3 phase iii u-13 clinical trials. the results of 5 of
these trials 7-9,11a2 had been published at the time of
manuscript preparation. the results of the additional
2 trials 1°a3 were available from abstracts.
clinical pharmacology
the synovial tissue of patients with ra contains
activated t cells, which suggests that activated t cells
contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of ra.
activated t cells stimulate macrophages, monocytes,
and synovial fibroblasts, which are involved in the
degradation and erosion of cartilage and bone. 14q6
t cells are believed to directly affect the autoimmune
and inflammatory cascade of ra by influencing cell
types through cell-to-cell contact and the production
of immunomodulatory cytokines. 14-16therefore, blocking t-cell activation is considered a rational approach
to the treatment of ra.
full activation of t cells requires co-stimulation
from their antigen-specific t-cell receptors and activation by a non-antigen-specific co-stimulatory receptor, typically cd28. cd28 is constitutively expressed
on t cells and binds to the ligand cds0 ( xxxg396xxx ) or
 xxxg398xxx  ( xxxg398xxx ) on activated antigen-presenting cells.
 xxxg544xxx -ig (cytotoxic t lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 fused to the heavy chain constant region of
human igg1 [ xxxd52xxx ]) blocks the links from cd28
to cds0 and  xxxg398xxx  by binding with higher avidity to
 xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx , resulting in downmodulation of the
immune response by the inability to engage the cd28
receptor on the t cell.  xxxd52xxx  binds to  xxxg396xxx  and
 xxxg398xxx  with 2500-fold and 570-fold greater affinity,
respectively, than does cd28.14-16

pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
properties
 xxxd52xxx  has been found to exhibit linear pharmacokinetic properties. in a small study of 43 patients
with psoriasis vulgaris, the cmax of  xxxd52xxx  after
a 1-hour iv infusion at doses ranging from 0.5 to
50 mg/kg were 17 and 2201 lag/ml, respectively. 17
the mean elimination half-life was 14.7 days, regardless
of the dose administered. 17 mean (sem) cmin values

associated with  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg iv were 28.7 (3.8)
and 22 (1.7) 1jg/ml at 60 and 180 days, respectively. 18
our review of the literature did not identify any trials
that have assessed additional pharmacokinetic parameters or the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd52xxx 
in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction.
two in vitro analyses 18,19assessed the effects of  xxxd52xxx  on t-cell proliferation. the first of these assessments found that  xxxd52xxx  was effective in suppressing
t-cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations between 0.316 and 100 lug/ml
(mean [sem] 10% [4%] to 24% [2%] and 39% [1%]
to 50% [4%], respectively), concentrations much lower
than those achieved with the currently recommended
 xxxd52xxx  dose of 10 mg/kg. 18 a subsequent analysis 19
showed that maximal inhibition of t-cell proliferation
(60%-95%) was associated with  xxxd52xxx  concentrations of 3 to 10 lag/ml. in this analysis,  xxxd52xxx  concentrations of 3 to 10 lag/ml resulted in inhibition of
proliferation of interleukin (il)-2,  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-0~, and interferon (ifn)-y (extent of inhibition not reported).  xxxd52xxx  did not inhibit il-8.
an open-label trial 2° aimed to investigate the effects
of  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg iv on synovial tissue histology in
12 patients and gene expression in 11 patients with
active ra and an inadequate response to at least
12 weeks of anti-tnf treatment. baseline characteristics
of patients are not reported. patients served as their own
controls. synovial tissue biopsies were obtained prior to
 xxxd52xxx  treatment and 7 to 14 days after the last infusion of  xxxd52xxx . administration of  xxxd52xxx  was associated with a decrease in cd4 staining by a score of
0.20 on a scale ranging from 0 to 4. there were also decreases in ifn-7, by 29.7%; il-1b, by 43.4%; tnf-0~,
by 23.6%; il-6, by 6%;  xxxg1418xxx , by
38.7%; and  xxxg1437xxx , by 48.3%.

efficacy and tolerability
the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd52xxx  have been
assessed in 4 phase ii 7-1° and 3 phase iii h-13 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.
all of the studies reviewed here included patients who
met the acr criteria for diagnosis of active ra21;
those in acr functional class i, ii, or iii (ie, at least
some functional capacity)22; and those between 18
and 65 years of age. with the exception of i trial, 8 all
of the trials we reviewed included patients who had
_>10 swollen joints and _>12 tender joints at the beginning of their respective studies.

efficacy was assessed primarily using the acr
criteria for 20% clinical improvement (acr20).
additional efficacy end points assessed in these clinical trials included acr criteria for 50% (acr50) and
70% (acr70) clinical improvement, improvement in
physical function, change in disease activity, improvement in health-related quality of life (hrqol), and
improvement in pain intensity. changes in physical
function were assessed using the health assessment
questionnaire (haq) 23 disability index. a clinically
significant improvement in physical function was defined as an increase of at least 0.3 unit from baseline
on the haq disability index (scale: 0 = no assistance
needed to 3 = subject usually needs both a special device and help from another person). disease activity
was assessed using the disease activity scale 28
(das28) 24 (score <2.6 indicates clinical remission,
_<3.2 indicates a low level of disease activity). the
acr criteria for clinical improvement 2s and the
das28 scores 24 are summarized in table i. hrqol
was assessed by the use of the medical outcomes
study 36-item short form health survey (sf-36) (medical outcomes trust, inc., boston, massachusetts). 26
sf-36 consists of 36 items. thirty-five of these items
were aggregated into 8 subscales: physical function;
pain; vitality; social function; and general, mental,
physical, and emotional health. scores on these 8 subscales were aggregated to derive physical-component
and mental-component summary scores (higher
scores indicate better health). separate 100-ram visual analog scales were used to assess pain as well as
patient and physician global assessments of disease
activity.

studies

the first trial, by moreland et al, 7 was a 12-week,
phase iia, multinational, dose-ranging clinical trial
conducted to determine the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of  xxxd52xxx  in patients with ra who
had been unsuccessfully treated with at least 1 nonbiological dmard or etanercept. although patients
were permitted to continue treatment with _>1 nsaid
and/or low-dose corticosteroid (prednisone _<10 mg/d
or equivalent), patients were asked to discontinue the
use of any dmard or etanercept 28 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. at randomization, the mean disease duration was 3.4 years, with
means of 30.3 tender and 21.9 swollen joints. the
population in that trial was 75% female, 91% white,

and 4% black. ninety percent of patients were receiving corticosteroids at study entry. participants were randomized to receive iv infusions of  xxxd52xxx  at doses
of 0.5 mg/kg (n = 26), 2 mg/kg (n = 32), or 10 mg/kg
(n = 32), or placebo (n = 32) on days 1, 15, 29, and 57.

at day 85, 23%, 44%, and 53% of the patients
who received  xxxd52xxx  0.5, 2, and 10 mg/kg, respectively, achieved an acr20 response compared with
31% in the group that received placebo (p not reported). also on day 85, 100% improvement in both
swollen and tender joints had occurred in 0%, 0%,

who received  xxxd52xxx  compared with 0% in the
group that received placebo (p not reported). the
most common adverse effects in patients who received
 xxxd52xxx  versus those who received placebo were
nausea and vomiting (5.6% vs 6.3%), headache
(8.9% vs 3.1%), fatigue (4.4% vs 3.1%), worsening
arthritis (4.4% vs 9.4%), and hypotension (3.3% vs
6.3%) (p not reported). the most common reason for
study withdrawal was worsening arthritis (32% in the
group that received placebo and 13% in the group
that received  xxxd52xxx ; p not reported).
although the study by moreland et al r was not
powered to detect statistical significance of betweengroup differences, the conclusion suggests that  xxxd52xxx  at doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg was associated with
improvements in the signs and symptoms of ra and
that  xxxd52xxx  was found to have efficacy in the treatment of ra. with only numeric improvements observed and a lack of statistical analysis of betweengroup differences, results must be interpreted with
caution and  xxxd52xxx  should be used only if potential
benefits outweigh the risks for adverse effects.
another trial, by kremer et al, s was a 6-month,
phase ii clinical trial to study the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd52xxx  in 339 patients with long-standing
ra (mean duration range, 8.9-9.7 years) despite at

least 6 months of treatment with weekly doses of methotrexate (mean dose range, 15.0-15.8 mg/wk). patients
were randomly assigned, with the use of a permutedblock size of 6, to receive infusions of  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg
(n = 105), 10 mg/kg (n = 115), or placebo (n = 119).
 xxxd52xxx  was given over a 30-minute infusion on days
1, 15, and 30 and each month thereafter for the entire
study duration. mean age was 55 years, 87% were white,
and 68% were women. although all use of dmards
other than methotrexate was discontinued, patients were
permitted to use nsaids and stable low-dose corticosteroids (<10 mg/d of prednisone or equivalent).
the primary end point of the study was the percentage of patients who achieved an acr20 response at
6 months. secondary end points included acr50 and
acr70 response rates. other end points included improvement in symptoms, functioning, and hrqol.
the acr20 response rates at the end of the study
were 60.0% in the group that received  xxxd52xxx 
10 mg/kg, 41.9% in the group that received  xxxd52xxx 
2 mg/kg, and 35.3% in the group that received placebo (p < 0.001 for  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg vs placebo; p =
ns for  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg vs placebo). in patients who
received  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg, the rates of acr50 and
acr70 responses were 22.9% and 10.5%, respectively, compared with 11.8% and 1.7% in patients who
received placebo (both, p < 0.05). in patients who received  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg, the rates of acr50 and
acr70 response were 36.5% and 16.5%, respectively,
compared with 11.8% and 1.7% with placebo (both,
p < 0.001). other end points are listed in table ii.
the most frequent adverse effects in the groups that
received placebo,  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg
observed in that trial s included headache (12.6%,
14.3%, and 10.4%, respectively), upper respiratory
tract infection (10.1%, 12.4%, and 13.0%), musculoskeletal pain (12.6%, 14.3%, and 7.0%), and nausea and vomiting (11.8%, 6.7%, and 13.9%) (p not
reported). other reported adverse effects included
fatigue, cough, diarrhea, and pharyngitis.
kremer et al s found that the percentages of serious adverse events were 10.1% in the group that received placebo, 11.4% in the group that received  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg
(p not reported), and 2.6% in the group that received
 xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg (p = 0.03 vs placebo). the rates of
discontinued treatment due to adverse events were 1.7%
in the group that received  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg, 6.7%
in the group that received  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg, and 5.9%
in the group that received placebo (p not reported).

based on the results of the study by kremer et al, s
the use of  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg appears to improve signs
and symptoms of ra with a tolerability profile similar
to that of placebo. although the reasons are unknown,
 xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg does not seem to be effective.
the third trial 9 was a phase iib extension of the
kremer trial s to determine the same primary and secondary end points over a 12-month period and yielded similar results. the major difference between this
trial and the previous one was that another dmard
could be added based on the clinical judgment of
the investigator. no significant differences in acr20,
acr50, and acr70 response rates were observed between the group that received  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg compared with the group that received placebo (table ii).
patients who had been treated with  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg
achieved an acr20 response rate of 62.6% compared with 36.1% in the placebo group (p < 0.001).
the acr50 and acr70 response rates in patients
who received 10 mg/kg  xxxd52xxx  versus patients
who received placebo were 41.7% versus 20.2% (p <
0.001) and 20.9% versus 7.6% (p = 0.003), respectively (table ii).
the most frequent adverse effects in the groups
that received placebo,  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg, and  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg were nasopharyngitis (9.2%, 18.1%,
and 14.8%, respectively), headache (15.1%, 16.2%,
and 14.8%), nausea (14.3%, 11.4%, and 13.9%),
and cough (12.6%, 9.5%, and 13.0%) (p not reported). treatment discontinuation rates at the end of the
study were 40.3%, 29.5%, and 22.6%, respectively,
in these 3 groups (p not reported).
the results of the second kremer study 9 supported
the tolerability of  xxxd52xxx  as well as the efficacy of
 xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg. it also supported the hypothesis
that the  xxxd52xxx  2-mg/kg dose was suboptimal.
study im1011011° was a 12-month, phase iib, multicenter study that assessed 121 patients with ra who
had had an inadequate response to etanercept. patients
who were receiving etanercept monotherapy were
eligible for participation in im101101 if they had
>_8 swollen joints and >10 tender joints, and patients
who were receiving etanercept and an oral dmard
were eligible if they had >_6 swollen joints and >8 tender
joints. patients were required to have been treated with
etanercept 25 mg sc biw for at least 3 months before
the study and to have been receiving a stable dose for
at least 28 days, with no response. patients were randomized (2:1) to receive  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg plus

etanercept 25 mg sc biw (n = 85) or placebo plus etanercept 25 mg sc biw (n = 36).  xxxd52xxx  and placebo
were administered as iv infusions on days 1, 15, 30,
and every 30 days thereafter.
the primary end point was the percentage of patients who achieved a modified acr20 response at
6 months. the modified acr20 excludes c-reactive
protein (crp) from the composite acr response due
to low baseline crp levels observed in patients with
active ra who received etanercept.
at 6 months, 48% of patients treated with  xxxd52xxx  compared with 31% in the group that received
placebo achieved a numeric difference in the modified
acr20 response (p = ns) (results at 12 months not
reported). similar to previous studies, 7,~ more patients
in the group that received placebo (33 %) discontinued
treatment with the study drug due to lack of medication effect than in the group that received  xxxd52xxx 
(11%) (p not reported). rates of adverse events were
not reported. it can be concluded that the study did
not provide significant clinical evidence of benefit
with the combination of  xxxd52xxx  and etanercept and
recommended that larger trials be completed to assess
this combination in the future.
phase iii studies

the  xxxd52xxx  trial in treatment of anti-tnf
inadequate responders (attain) i1 was a study in
391 patients with ra and an inadequate response to
at least 3 months of anti-tnf-0t treatment (etanercept, infliximab, or both). patients were included if
they had long-standing disease (mean [sd] duration,
12.2 [8.5] years in the group that received  xxxd52xxx 
and 11.4 [8.9] years in the group that received placebo). all patients were required to discontinue treatment with etanercept at least 28 days prior to
randomization and/or infliximab at least 60 days
prior to randomization. additional inclusion criteria
were use of an oral dmard for at least 3 months,
with the dose being stable for at least 28 days. the
most commonly used dmard in the  xxxd52xxx  and
placebo groups was methotrexate (75.6% and 82.0%,
respectively). a small percentage of patients (2.3%)
received anakinra as the background dmard. the
use of oral corticosteroids (<10 mg/d of prednisone or
equivalent) at a stable dose was allowed during the
study period.
patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive
placebo or  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg administered as a
t770

......

: •

30-minute iv infusion on days 1, 15, 29, and every
28 days thereafter for up to 6 months of treatment.
the primary end points of that trial included the proportions of patients with an acr20 response and the
proportions of patients with an improvement in
physical function (defined as an increase from baseline of at least 0.3 unit on the haq disability index)
at 6 months. additional end points were acr50 and
acr70 response rates, mean improvement in physical function (based on change in haq disability
index), changes in disease activity, and change in
hrqol.
at 6 months, 50.4% of patients who received  xxxd52xxx  and 19.5% of those who received placebo
achieved an acr20 response (p < 0.001). the acr50
and acr70 response rates were 20.3% and 10.2%,
respectively, in the group that received  xxxd52xxx  compared with 3.8% and 1.5% in the group that received
placebo (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively). ten
percent of the  xxxd52xxx  group achieved disease remission, defined as das28 score <2.6, at 6 months compared with 0.8% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). in
addition, 17.1% of patients in the  xxxd52xxx  group
had a low level of disease activity, defined as das28
score <3.2, compared with 3.1% in the placebo group
(p < 0.001). the mean improvement in the haq disability index was 0.45 in the group that received  xxxd52xxx  compared with 0.11 in the group that received
placebo (p < 0.001), and 47.3% and 23.3% of the
 xxxd52xxx  and placebo groups, respectively, had a clinically meaningful improvement in physical function
(p < 0.001). statistically significant improvements in
sf-36 mental- and physical-component summary scores
were seen in patients assigned to the group that received  xxxd52xxx  (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) (table iii). 11
in the group that received  xxxd52xxx , 79.5% of patients experienced an adverse event compared with
71.4% of patients in the group that received placebo
(p not reported). the most common adverse effect
was headache, affecting 12.4% of patients assigned to
receive  xxxd52xxx  compared with 5.3% of patients assigned to receive placebo (p = 0.03). the incidence of
serious infections was 2.3% irrespective of treatment
assignment. the definition of serious infection was
not provided. antibodies against  xxxd52xxx  developed
in 1.3% of patients. acute infusion reactions, most
commonly described as dizziness and headache, were
reported in 5% of patients who received  xxxd52xxx

compared with 3% in the group that received placebo
(p = ns). infusion reactions were classified as mild to
moderate; however, the definitions of severity of these
reactions were not provided.
of the group that received  xxxd52xxx , 86.4% of patients completed 6 months of treatment compared
with 74.4% of patients in the group that received
placebo. lack of efficacy was the main reason for discontinuation of the study drug and accounted for
5.4% of patients in the group that received  xxxd52xxx 
and 20.3% of patients in the group that received
placebo (p < 0.001). a serious adverse event was the
primary reason for discontinuation of treatment in
2.7% of the  xxxd52xxx  group compared with 1.5% of
the placebo group (p not reported).
the results of attain 11 suggest that  xxxd52xxx , in
combination with an oral dmard, administered as a
30-minute iv infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days
1, 15, 29, and every 28 days thereafter, may improve
symptoms, physical function, disease activity, and
quality of life in patients with advanced ra.
the  xxxd52xxx  in inadequate responders to
methotrexate (aim) 12 trial was a 1-year, multinational,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
that compared the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd52xxx 
relative to placebo in patients who received methotrexate and had an inadequate response to methotrexate
treatment. the primary efficacy end points of the aim
trial were acr20 response rate at 6 months, the proportion of patients with clinically significant improvement in haq disability index (>0.3 unit) at 1 year,
and structural damage progression at 1 year. additional
end points were acr50 and acr70 response rates at
6 months and all acr response rates at 1 year. structural damage progression was assessed with the use of
the genant-modified sharp score. 28 changes in disease
activity using das28 were also assessed.
patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg iv (n = 433) or placebo (n = 219) on
study days 1, 15, 29, and every 28 days thereafter for the
duration of the study. all patients received methotrexate
treatment for the duration of the study. however, patients were instructed to discontinue all other dmards.
the use of stable doses of nsaids and corticosteroids
(_<10 mg/d of prednisone or equivalent) were allowed.
changes to therapy were permissible between months 6
and 12 of the study and included adjustment of the
methotrexate dose, the addition of an oral dmard, or
adjustment of the corticosteroid dose.

baseline characteristics were similar between the 2
study groups. at randomization, the mean duration of
disease was 8.5 years in patients who received  xxxd52xxx  and 8.9 years in patients who received placebo.
the mean number of tender and swollen joints was
31.0 and 21.4, respectively, in patients who received
 xxxd52xxx  and 32.3 and 22.1 in patients who received
placebo.
 xxxd52xxx  therapy was associated with a clinically
significant increase in acr20, acr50, and acr70
response rates at 6 months and further increases
through 1 year (table ili). at 1 year, 42.5% of patients who received  xxxd52xxx  compared with 9.9% of
patients who received placebo achieved low disease
activity (p < 0.001) and 23.8% of patients who received  xxxd52xxx  compared with 1.9% of patients
who received placebo were in remission (p < 0.001).
additionally, at 1 year, the median changes from baseline in erosion score were 0.0 and 0.27 in the  xxxd52xxx  and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.029). the
median changes in total genant-modified sharp
scores were 0.25 and 0.53 in the  xxxd52xxx  and placebo groups (p = 0.012). those findings suggest that
 xxxd52xxx , when used in combination with methotrexate, may slow disease progression.
a subsequent analysis of the data from the aim
trial demonstrated that  xxxd52xxx  provides significant
and sustained improvement in pain, fatigue, disease
activity, and h r q o l over i year (results presented in
table iii). 29-31
the overall incidences of adverse events and serious
adverse events were 87.3% in the  xxxd52xxx  group and
84% in the placebo group (p not reported). the most
frequently reported adverse effects in the  xxxd52xxx  and
placebo groups were headache (17.6% vs 11.9%), nasopharyngitis (15.2% vs 11.4%), nausea (12.0% vs
11.0%), diarrhea (10.9% vs 9.6%), and upper respiratory infection (10.9% vs 9.6%). serious infection was
documented in 2.5 % of patients who received  xxxd52xxx 
compared with 0.9% of patients in the placebo group
(p not reported). acute infusion reactions occurred in
8.8% of patients treated with  xxxd52xxx  and 4.1% of
patients who received placebo.
more patients in the placebo group (26%) than in
the  xxxd52xxx  group (11%) discontinued the study
drug (p not reported). the most common reasons for
discontinuation were lack of efficacy ( xxxd52xxx , 3%;
placebo, 18%) and adverse events ( xxxd52xxx , 4.2%;
placebo, 1.8%) (p not reported).

the aim trial once again suggested that  xxxd52xxx ,
compared with placebo, in conjunction with methotrexate was associated with clinical improvement and
may have slowed the progression of ra. the major
limitation of the aim trial is that the study was funded by bristol-myers squibb company, the manufacturer of  xxxd52xxx . the funding source was involved
in designing the study, generating the randomization
schedule, and in statistical analysis and interpretation
of the results.
in the  xxxd52xxx  study of safety in use with other
rheumatoid arthritis therapies (assure), 13 1441 patients were randomized (randomization method not
reported) to receive  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg as an iv infusion (n = 959) or placebo (n = 482) for 1 year. all patients received either a biological or a nonbiological
dmard. patients were subdivided into 4 groups:
 xxxd52xxx /nonbiological dmard (n = 856), placebo/
nonbiological dmard (n = 418),  xxxd52xxx /biological
dmard (n -- 103), and placebo/biological dmard
(n = 64). overall, 12.8% of patients treated with  xxxd52xxx  and 18 % of patients treated with placebo did not
complete the study. an adverse event was the main
reason for discontinuation of therapy in 5.3% of patients who received  xxxd52xxx  and 3.9% of patients
who received placebo (p not reported). lack of efficacy resulted in discontinuation of study drug in 2.7%
of patients in the group that received  xxxd52xxx  and
9.1% of patients in the group that received placebo
(p not reported).
although the primary focus of assure was tolerability, patient-related outcomes, including physical
function and patient global assessment of disease activity and pain, were assessed. at 1 year, 47.3% of all
patients treated with  xxxd52xxx  achieved a clinically
meaningful haq response compared with 34.6% of
patients who received placebo (p < 0.001). additionally, patients assigned to the group that received
 xxxd52xxx  bad a greater mean percentage improvement from baseline at 1 year in physical function,
disease activity, and pain compared with placebo
(table iii). the greatest benefit on patient-related outcomes was seen in patients assigned to  xxxd52xxx  who
were treated with a nonbiological dmard (table iii).
the overall incidences of adverse events were
55.7% in the group that received  xxxd52xxx  and
49.6% in the group that received placebo (p not reported). the overall incidences of serious adverse
events in the  xxxd52xxx  group were 2.4% compared
1774

'

i ~

:~:(~i, ~i

with 2.7% in the placebo group. the incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events were highest in
the  xxxd52xxx /biological dmard group (95.1% and
22.3 %, respectively) compared with the other 3 groups,
in which the incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events ranged from 86.1% to 89.1% and 11.7%
to 12.5% (p not reported). a similar trend was seen in
the incidences of infections, serious infections, and neoplasms; 19.4%, 3.9%, and 6.8%, respectively, in patients assigned to receive  xxxd52xxx /biological dmard
compared with 6.3% to 8.8%, 1.0% to 1.6%, and
1.6% to 3.8% in patients assigned to the additional
3 groups (p not reported).
the results of assure suggest that the use of  xxxd52xxx  in combination with a biological dmard was
associated with an increased risk for toxicity without
any additional benefit. the results must be interpreted with caution because statistical analysis was not
performed in that trial and the results of the trial are
available only from abstracts.

tolerability considerations
the tolerability of  xxxd52xxx  was assessed by a
pooled analysis 13 of 5 double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials. tolerability data were aggregated from 2 phase ii
trials and 3 phase ill trials. a total of 1955 patients were
treated with  xxxd52xxx  2 or 10 mg/kg iv and 989 patients received placebo. the majority of patients (n =
1765) from these trials received  xxxd52xxx  at a fixed
dose of 10 mg/kg iv infusion on days 1, 15, 29, and
every 28 days thereafter. overall, 88.8% of patients assigned to receive  xxxd52xxx  and 84.9% of patients assigned to receive placebo experienced >1 adverse event
and 13.6% of patients in the group that received  xxxd52xxx  compared with 12.3% of patients in the group that
received placebo experienced a serious adverse event.
the majority of adverse events were mild to moderate.
the study drug was discontinued secondary to an adverse event in 5.5% of patients who received  xxxd52xxx 
and 3.9% of patients who received placebo. a serious
adverse event resulted in discontinuation of the study
drug in 2.7% of  xxxd52xxx -treated patients compared
with 1.6% of patients who received placebo. the incidence of mortality was 0.5% in patients who received
 xxxd52xxx  and 0.6% of the group assigned to placebo
(p not reported). causes of death were not reported by
the investigators.
the most frequent adverse events reported in the
 xxxd52xxx  and placebo groups were headache (18.2%

vs 12.6%), upper respiratory infections (12.7% vs
12.0%), nausea (11.5% vs 10.6%), and nasopharyngitis (11.5% vs 9.1%). there was no significant difference in the incidence of neoplasm (1.2% vs 1.0%).
 xxxd52xxx  therapy was associated with increased risks
for infection (53.8% vs 48.3%; p not reported) and
serious infections (3.0% vs 1.9%; p not reported)
compared with placebo. the rates of adverse events,
serious adverse events, infections, and serious infections were highest in patients treated with  xxxd52xxx 
and a biological dmard and occurred at incidences
of 94.1%, 19.6%, 63.7%, and 4.4%, respectively
(figure). these findings should be interpreted with
caution because they were presented in an abstract,
and statistical analysis was not performed.

drug-drug interactions
our review of the literature did not identify any
studies of drug-drug interactions with the use of  xxxd52xxx . in clinical trials,  xxxd52xxx  has been used in combination with nsaids, corticosteroids, methotrexate,
 xxxd3255xxx ,  xxxd2450xxx , and  xxxd2301xxx 
without any noticeable impact on the tolerability or
efficacy. based on the results from the assure trial 13

o

i

pham
,' i

and findings from a pooled analysis, 32 the use of  xxxd52xxx  in combination with biological dmards has
been associated with an increased risk for adverse effects, increases in the incidences of infections and serious infections, and an increase in the incidence of
neoplasms, without any additional benefit. it is difficult
to assess the effects of anakinra on the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd52xxx  due to limited experience with
concomitant use of these agents. therefore, administration of  xxxd52xxx  in combination with anakinra or
tnf-(z antagonists is not recommended. 33 a review of
the literature did not identify any anecdotal reports of
drug-drug interactions.

dosage, administration, and monitoring
 xxxd52xxx  has been approved for reducing signs
and symptoms of ra, inducing major clinical response, slowing the progression of structural damage,
and improving physical function in adult patients
(_>18 years of age) with moderate to severe active ra
who have had an inadequate response to dmards.
 xxxd52xxx  may be used as monotherapy or in combination with nonbiological dmards but should not
be used with tnf-c~ antagonists. it is supplied as a

white, preservative-free, sterile, lyophilized powder for
iv infusion after reconstitution with 10 ml of sterile
water and diluted with 100 ml of 0.9% sodium
chloride. each single-use vial contains 250 mg of
 xxxd52xxx  and should be administered iv over 30 minutes. the dose of  xxxd52xxx  is dependent on patients'
body weight. in patients weighing <60 kg, between 60
and 100 kg, and >100 kg, doses of 500 rag, 750 mg,
and 1000 rag, respectively, of  xxxd52xxx  are indicated.
this dosage appropriately corresponds to the effectively used 10-mg/kg  xxxd52xxx  dose that was used in
the trials reviewed. 8,9,11-13 after the initial administration,  xxxd52xxx  should be given at weeks 2 and 4, and
then every 4 weeks thereafter. patients as well as clinicians should monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, particularly upper respiratory tract infection and
nasopharyngitis, as well as nausea, infusion-related
hypersensitivity reactions, and dyspnea. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) exacerbations,
rhonchi, cough, and dyspnea were more frequent in
patients with copd when treated with  xxxd52xxx 
compared with when they received placebo. hence, respiratory status should be monitored closely in patients
with copd. 34  xxxd52xxx  is pregnancy category c
and should not be used during pregnancy unless it is
clearly needed. 33 the manufacturer does not indicate
the need to modify dosing based on renal impairment,
hepatic impairment, age, sex, or ethnicity.
pharmacoeconomic considerations
our review of the literature did not reveal any
formal pharmacoeconomic assessments of  xxxd52xxx 
treatment.  xxxd52xxx  is available as a lyophilized
powder for iv injection in a 15-ml vial containing
250 mg of  xxxd52xxx  at 16.7 mg/ml. the average
wholesale price per vial is $562.50. 35 thus, the cost
of  xxxd52xxx  for a person weighing -70 kg would be
-$3375 for the first month and $1687.50 per month
thereafter.
conclusions
 xxxd52xxx  is a fusion protein developed to modulate
the t-cell co-stimulatory signal that is mediated
through the cd28- xxxg396xxx /86 pathway. clinical trials
have consistently provided evidence of the efficacy of
this medication in combination with nonbiological
dmards in patients with moderate to severe, active
ra who had an inadequate response to tnf antagonists or methotrexate monotherapy.  xxxd52xxx  thera-

py had a significant and consistent impact on clinical
improvement, physical function, pain, disease activity,
and quality of life. the most commonly reported adverse effects associated with  xxxd52xxx  treatment were
headache (18.2%), upper respiratory infection (12.7%),
nasopharyngitis (11.5%), and nausea (11.5%). the
findings of the currently available clinical trials suggest that  xxxd52xxx  may become an important component of ra treatment. additional trials are needed
to determine long-term tolerability of this agent and
whether the clinical benefits of  xxxd52xxx  found in
the clinical trials reviewed here would be sustained
over time.
