cobalamin transport proteins and
their cell-surface receptors
bellur seetharam and raghunatha r. yammani
the primary function of cobalamin (cbl;  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx ) is the formation of red
blood cells and the maintenance of a healthy nervous system. before cells can
utilise dietary cbl, the vitamin must undergo cellular transport using two distinct
receptor-mediated events. first, dietary cbl bound to gastric intrinsic factor
(if) is taken up from the apical pole of ileal epithelial cells via a  xxxg557xxx ,
 xxxg557xxx , and is transported across the cell bound to another cbl-binding protein,
transcobalamin ii (tc ii). second, plasma tc ii–cbl is taken up by cells that
need cbl via the tc ii receptor (tc ii-r), a 62 kda protein that is expressed as a
functional dimer in cellular plasma membranes. human cbl deficiency can
develop as a result of acquired or inherited dysfunction in either of these two
transmembrane transport events. this review focuses on the biochemical,
cellular and molecular aspects of if and tc ii and their cell-surface receptors.
cobalamin (cbl;  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx ) is a water-soluble
vitamin of molecular weight 1357 that is present
in limited amounts in the diet, primarily in meat,
eggs and dairy products. owing to its highly polar
nature, the physiological amounts of cbl that are
needed on a daily basis (2–5 µg) cannot be
absorbed by diffusion, an inefficient process.
thus, all higher animals including humans have
developed a complex yet efficient mechanism to
extract very tiny amounts of cbl present bound
to food proteins, then absorb and transport it into
cells.
two distinct receptor-mediated events are
required to absorb and utilise cbl in mammals

(fig. 1). first, intestinal absorption of dietary and
biliary cbl involves gastric intrinsic factor (if)mediated transcellular transport of cbl across the
ileal cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. the
 xxxg557xxx  for if–cbl (ref. 1) was originally
known as  xxxg557xxx  but is now known as ‘ xxxg557xxx ’
because of the presence of a large number of
cub domains in its structure (see below) (ref. 2).
after entry into the ileal cell, cbl is transported
across it bound to another cbl-binding protein,
transcobalamin ii (tc ii) (ref. 3). absorbed cbl
bound to plasma tc ii is then transported to all
cells of the body that need cbl via portal vein
blood (ref. 4). the second receptor-mediated

figure 1. human cobalamin (cbl;  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx ) transport systems. (a) transport across ileal epithelium.
within the ileum, dietary cobalamin (cbl) is bound by gastric intrinsic factor (if), a glycoprotein secreted by the
gastric epithelium; the if–cbl complex then binds to  xxxg557xxx , a receptor localised to the apical pole of ileal
epithelial cells (enterocytes).  xxxg557xxx  lacks a membrane-anchoring domain, but is thought to associate with the
apical enterocyte membrane through an interaction with  xxxg1342xxx . cbl enters the ileal cell by receptor-mediated
endocytosis, and, following lysosomal degradation of if, is transported across the cell bound to the carrier
protein transcobalamin ii (tc ii), to be secreted into the portal vein. (b) cellular conversion to coenzyme forms.
plasma tc ii–cbl is taken up by most cells, such as hepatocytes and renal proximal tubular epithelial cells,
that express the tc ii receptor (tc ii-r). within the cells, cbl is converted to its coenzyme forms, methyl-cbl
and 5'-deoxyadenosyl-cbl, which are then used for the enzymatic conversion of homocysteine to methionine
and methylmalonyl coa to succinyl coa, respectively. (c) storage and clearance of cbl and cblas.
hepatocytes take up cbl or its analogues (cblas) bound to hc via the asialoglycoprotein receptor (asgp-r)
and cbl bound to tc ii via tc ii-r. cbl liberated following degradation of hc–cbl or tc ii–cbl is either stored
in the form of cbl-dependent enzymes or secreted via bile to be reabsorbed.  xxxg1414xxx  either released from hc or
still bound to it is secreted via bile. hc in the bile might originate from the circulation (via uptake by the
hepatocytes) or from de novo synthesis by the liver. in either case it is degraded in the intestinal lumen by
pancreatic proteases. once in the lumen, the secreted cbl and  xxxg1414xxx  bind to gastric if and, depending upon
the availability of free if–cbl binding sites of  xxxg557xxx , are either reabsorbed as a part of the enterohepatic
circulation or excreted in the faeces. the three receptors are shown in their monomeric forms, although  xxxg557xxx 
and tc ii-r are known to exist as a trimer and dimer, respectively; only one of the two subunits of asgp-r is
shown (fig001bsw).

physiology and pathophysiology of
intestinal absorption of cbl
the entire process of cbl absorption begins in
the stomach, continues in the intestinal lumen,
and is completed in the terminal ileum. the
multiple mechanisms involved include gastric
secretions of acid, pepsin and if, pancreatic
secretion of proteolytic enzymes, and a specific
ileal transport system. the most common cause
for the development of cbl deficiency, other than
lack of dietary intake (as in vegans and strict

vegetarians), is a failure of gastrointestinal
absorption of cbl. many aspects of this complex
normal physiological process have been learned
from patients who failed to absorb dietary cbl for
various reasons.

initial phases
cbl in the diet is mostly bound to food proteins
and must be extracted from these proteins before
it can bind to if and ultimately be transported to
the circulation. this is accomplished in three steps
(reviewed in refs 9, 10). first, most of the foodprotein-bound cbl is released in the stomach by
a combined action of acid and pepsin. second,
owing to its higher affinity for cbl at gastric ph,
hc derived from saliva and gastric secretions
sequesters cbl released from the food proteins,
preventing it from binding to if. third, pancreatic
proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and
others, proteolytically digest hc–cbl to release
cbl into the intestinal lumen. since degraded hc
cannot re-bind cbl, cbl that is freed from hc then
binds to gastric if (ref. 11).

intestinal uptake of if–cbl
even though a large amount of if is secreted
from the stomach and about 8–10 µg of cbl,
representing both dietary and biliary sources, is
presented to the enterocytes on a daily basis, the
capacity for cbl absorption is limited to about
1–1.5 µg/day. this limited capacity of if-mediated
cbl transport in the intestine is due to the
restriction of expression of  xxxg557xxx  to the terminal
ileum, the limited number of if–cbl-binding sites
at this location, and the slow turnover of the
receptor (ref. 12). however, since the daily loss
of cbl from the 5 mg of cbl stored by the human
body is estimated from animal studies to be about
0.02% (i.e. 1 µg/day) (ref. 13), it is likely that the
limited capacity of ileal cbl transport in humans
is adequate to compensate for the amount of cbl
lost on a daily basis.
in the ileal apical brush border,  xxxg557xxx  is
associated with  xxxg1342xxx , another large endocytic
receptor, of molecular mass 600 kda (fig. 2). the
interaction between these two proteins has been
suggested to be important for the endocytosis of
if–cbl (ref. 14). although  xxxg557xxx  and  xxxg1342xxx 
are associated with each other during endocytosis
of if–cbl, it is not known whether these two
membrane proteins recycle back to the apical
membranes still bound to each other or whether
they recycle separately.

cobalamin transport proteins and their cell-surface receptors

event is cellular entry of tc ii–cbl via the specific
tc ii receptor (tc ii-r), a 62 kda protein that
functions as a dimer in plasma membranes of
most tissues/cells (ref. 5). intracellularly, cbl is
converted to coenzyme forms – methyl-cbl and
5'-deoxyadenosyl-cbl – and is utilised for the
enzymatic remethylation of homocysteine to
methionine and for the conversion of
methylmalonyl coa to succinyl coa, respectively,
which are used in various metabolic processes
(ref. 6).
analogues of cbl produced by bacteria or
ingested from the diet are also absorbed (although
not utilised) by mammalian cells, and this is
accomplished via a third transport system. these
analogues bind with high affinity to  xxxg2255xxx 
(hc; also referred to as  xxxg2255xxx  or the r protein) and
are cleared via hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor
into bile (ref. 7). in addition to cbl analogues,
which are probably secreted bound to hc, cbl is
also secreted into the bile as a part of enterohepatic
circulation following its mobilisation from the
liver. it is likely that this process is designed
mainly to recirculate absorbed cbl obtained from
the diet and to provide cbl for tissues/cells that
need it when the exogenous sources of cbl are
inadequate or nonexistent. once in the lumen, cbl
and its analogues are mostly subjected to
reabsorption as a part of the enterohepatic
circulation, and when their concentrations exceed
the capacity of ileal  xxxg557xxx  to bind and reabsorb
them, they are excreted in the faeces.
this review focuses on the transport proteins
that are required for normal absorption and
transport of cbl, and how defects in their
expression or function, due to either inherited or
acquired causes, results in the development of cbl
deficiency. when relevant, structural aspects of
hc are discussed, but the structural aspects of the
asialoglycoprotein receptor are outside the scope
of this review and the reader is referred to ref. 8.

transcellular transport of cobalamin (cbl;  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx ) in an ileal cell
expert reviews in molecular medicine c 2003 cambridge university press
figure 2. transcellular transport of cobalamin (cbl;  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx ) in an ileal cell. following binding of cbl
to gastric intrinsic factor (if) in the gut lumen, the if–cbl complex binds to  xxxg557xxx  in the ileal apical brush
border.  xxxg557xxx  is also associated with  xxxg1342xxx  and the interaction between these two proteins has been
suggested to be important for the endocytosis of if–cbl. after endocytosis, if–cbl– xxxg557xxx – xxxg1342xxx  is processed
via the classical endosomal–lysosomal pathway. the release of cbl from if begins in the endosomes as a
result of acidic ph alone and is completed as these endosomes mature into lysosomes, and this process
requires degradation of if by lysosomal proteases. both  xxxg557xxx  and  xxxg1342xxx  might be recycled, and
intralysosomal free cbl is transported out of the lysosomes. it is speculated that cbl enters a secretory vesicle
that contains transcobalamin ii (tc ii) as cargo, and tc ii–cbl is then secreted via the basolateral membrane
to enter the circulation. there are at least four genetic disorders of cbl malabsorption known in children, in
which blocks occur at specific steps in the transport pathway. the blocks are labelled as types 1–4: type 1 is a
lack of formation of the if–cbl complex (types 1a–c) or its dysfunction (type 1d); type 2 is a lack of uptake (type
2a) or decreased uptake (type 2b) of if–cbl as a result of defects in  xxxg557xxx ; type 3 is retention of cbl inside the
ileal cell as a result of a failure in cbl transport out of the acidic vesicles; and type 4 is a failure of cbl to exit the
ileal cell and enter the circulation as a result of lack of tc ii synthesis (type 4a) or, rarely, dysfunctional tc ii
that is unable to bind cbl (type 4b). abbreviation: er, endoplasmic reticulum (fig002bsw).

following binding of if–cbl to  xxxg557xxx , if–cbl
is endocytosed from the apical or luminal side of
the ileal cell, and there is then a delay of about 4 h
before cbl enters the circulation bound to tc ii
(fig. 2). available evidence from several earlier
studies indicates that if–cbl is processed via the
classical endosomal–lysosomal pathway (ref. 10
and citations therein). at some stage during the
endosomal–lysosomal processing of the if–cbl
complex, if is degraded and liberated cbl is
transported out of the lysosomes. although not
directly demonstrated, it is speculated that cbl
enters a secretory vesicle that contains tc ii as
a cargo. tc ii–cbl is then secreted via the
basolateral membrane to enter the circulation. the
importance of lysosomes during the transcellular
transport of cbl is supported by the evidence that

lysosomal inhibitors such as chloroquine or
leupeptin prevented if degradation, resulting in
a failure to liberate cbl bound to it (refs 15, 16).

sensitive to acid and proteolytic enzymes (type
1b), does not bind cbl (type 1c), or can bind
cbl but has low affinity for the ileal receptor
(type 1d). the molecular basis for expression of
these phenotypes is not known. although
serum cbl levels are usually low, the gastric
function and morphology are normal and serum
autoantibodies to if are absent.
type 2 malabsorption arises from selective
gastrointestinal malabsorption of cbl, and is also
known as imerslund–grasbeck syndrome (ig
syndrome). by linkage analysis, the disease gene
of ig syndrome was mapped to a 6 cm region of
chromosome 10p12.1 (ref. 17), the same region
that encoded the if–cbl-binding protein  xxxg557xxx .
cbl malabsorption in these patients is due to total
lack of uptake (type 2a) or decreased uptake (type
2b) of if–cbl as a result of defects in  xxxg557xxx . over
200 patients have been identified worldwide, with
clusters of cases reported in norway, finland and
several middle eastern countries, including israel.
in addition to megalobastic anaemia and low
serum cbl levels, these patients also have
proteinuria, which is not cured even when cbl
status improves with treatment. malabsorption of
cbl and megaloblastic anaemia noted in finnish
patients have been attributed to two mutations
in the  xxxg557xxx  molecule (ref. 18): a missense
mutation resulting in the substitution of a proline

for leucine at residue position 1297 of  xxxg557xxx 
(fm1); and mutation of a single nucleotide (fm2)
that results in the inframe insertion of multiple
stop codons in cub domain 6 (see below).
whereas  xxxg557xxx  in fm1 patients has a decreased
affinity for if–cbl (ref. 19), patients with fm2
might have a truncated receptor that fails to reach
the apical brush border of ileal absorptive cells.
there is some debate about whether mutations
in the  xxxg557xxx  molecule are solely responsible
for the cbl malabsorption and megaloblastic
anaemia, as these mutations were noted only in
finnish patients and not in patients from norway
and saudi arabia. studies supporting the role of
a protein other than  xxxg557xxx , which is essential for
its functional expression in the apical brush border
membranes, have come from a canine model of
selective cbl malabsorption and megaloblastic
anaemia (ref. 20). in these affected animals  xxxg557xxx 
was not expressed in both the ileal and renal apical
brush border membrane (ref. 21) and did not
contain the disease mutations noted in finnish
patients (ref. 22). on the basis of these findings,
it was suggested (ref. 22) that more than one
phenotype of ig syndrome could exist and that
mutations in an accessory protein could affect
intracellular trafficking and targeting of  xxxg557xxx 
to the apical brush border. although no such
accessory protein has been identified, the

candidates include receptor-associated protein
(ref. 14),  xxxg1342xxx  (ref. 14), and the product of a
newly discovered gene, the  xxxg155xxx  gene
(amn) (ref. 23), that encodes a transmembrane
protein. amn contains a 5'-extracellular cysteinerich domain, and homozygous mutations in exons
1–4 also lead to both selective cbl malabsorption
and megaloblastic anaemia. however, it remains
to be established whether amn and  xxxg557xxx  gene
products function together or independently in
cbl absorption.
type 3 malabsorption is the intracellular
retention of cbl inside the ileal cell as a result of a
failure in cbl transport out of the acidic vesicles
(endosomes or lysosomes). this disorder, also
known as cbl f (ref. 24), is very rare and has been
described in only a handful of patients. although
not characterised well, a lysosomal transporter of
cbl has been demonstrated in rat liver (ref. 25).
cbl has been shown to accumulate in the
lysosomes of cbl f patients (ref. 26), and this is
thought to arise from the expression of a defective
transporter that fails to transport cbl out of the
lysosomes into the cytoplasm. thus, cbl cannot
bind to tc ii, a necessary step before cbl enters
the circulation, and is not available for the cellular
synthesis of its coenzyme forms (ref. 27). a
schilling test (which measures intestinal
absorption capacity for cbl) performed on a cbl
f child showed decreased urinary excretion of cbl,
indicating malabsorption of orally administered
cbl (ref. 28), and the importance of lysosomes in
cbl transport across the ileal cell. it should be
noted that both type 2 and type 3 malabsorption
have been collectively known as ig syndrome. in
both these disorders there is a failure of cbl
absorption after the formation of if–cbl complex
and before cbl is transferred to tc ii.
type 4 malabsorption describes a failure of
cbl to exit the ileal cell and enter the circulation.
it results from lack of tc ii synthesis (type 4a) or,
rarely, dysfunctional tc ii that is unable to bind
cbl (type 4b). surprisingly, children with type 4
malabsorption have normal or nearly normal
serum cbl levels, indicating that most of the
circulatory cbl is bound to plasma hc. however,
these children will develop cbl deficiency as cbl
bound to hc will not be delivered to cells other
than hepatocytes because of the paucity of
expression of the asialoglycoprotein receptor in
many tissues/cells
these genetic disorders of cbl absorption
appear to be inherited as autosomal traits. many

expert reviews

in molecular medicine

of the disorders have been detected in children
residing in western countries, and their incidence
worldwide is not known. it is important to
diagnose cbl deficiency in such children as
early as possible and treat them with regular
intramuscular injections of cbl to prevent
complications that can cause developmental delay
and megaloblastic anaemia. these rare genetic
disorders are discussed in more detail in other
review articles (e.g. ref. 29).
the molecular basis for the development of cbl
deficiency in children caused by defects in if and
tc ii is not fully understood. in a few cases that
have been examined, the most common cause of
human tc ii deficiency, lack of plasma tc ii, has
been shown to be due to small and large deletions
of the gene (ref. 30) or to nonsense-mutationmediated mrna degradation (ref. 31). in patients
with these mutations, no tc ii is synthesised. in
a few patients who express nonfunctional tc ii,
the defect appears to be errors in mrna editing
(ref. 32). in two cousins with juvenile pernicious
anaemia, the gene encoding if was intact
suggesting that this rare disease is not due to if
gene deletion (ref. 33).
although children with either dysfunction or
lack of if and tc ii do develop cbl deficiency,
it is not known whether hc deficiency or
dysfunction directly causes cbl deficiency. hc
deficiency has been noted in only a few children
and seems to occur either alone or along with a
deficiency of other granular proteins such as
lactoferrin (ref. 34). no dna abnormalities of
the gene encoding hc have been noted. patients
with hc deficiency have low serum cbl levels,
but they show no signs of cbl deficiency, most
probably because their plasma tc ii levels are
usually normal. however, some patients develop
myelopathy not attributed to other causes. the
role of hc in normal cbl balance is not known
and it is speculated, based on its higher affinity
for cbl analogues than cbl, that hc might
function in the hepatic clearance of harmful
analogues of cbl. thus, lack of hc might only
cause cbl deficiency when the cbl analogues
accumulate and replace cbl bound to intracellular
cbl-dependent enzymes and inhibit their
function. in addition, given the presence of hc
in human milk, it is likely that its absence in milk
from hc-deficient mothers might create cbl
deficiency in breast-fed infants (ref. 29). there is
some evidence in animal experiments that in
breast-fed pups, cbl bound to milk hc is taken

expression occur only after weaning.

acquired disorders
malabsorption of cbl by acquired causes can
occur as a consequence of diseases of multiple
organs, including the stomach, pancreas,
terminal ileum and thyroid (ref. 10; table 2).
malabsorption of cbl caused by diseases of the
stomach such as atropic gastritis, and partial or
total gastrectomy, involves either injury or loss
of parietal cells that produce if. in addition,
because of the lack of acid and pepsin, there
might be inadequate release of cbl bound to
food proteins. patients with gastric tumours
(zollinger–ellison syndrome) might gradually
develop cbl deficiency as a result of a slow
transfer of cbl from hc to if. however, these
patients appear to absorb crystalline cbl better

than food-protein-bound cbl (ref. 35). exocrine
pancreatic insufficiency or intestinal diseases such
as bacterial overgrowth, infestation, tropical
sprue, ileal disease and crohn’s disease are also
known to cause cbl malabsorption.
cbl malabsorption in patients with pancreatic
insufficiency is correctable with pancreatic
supplements (ref. 36), and in patients with
intestinal infestation and bacterial overgrowth it
can be corrected following elimination of these
causes (e.g. by treatment with antibiotics). patients
with permanent loss of if following total gastric
surgery, or loss of  xxxg557xxx  because of terminal ileal
resection, will require cbl supplementation. if
there is sufficient stomach remaining to produce
if or gut remaining to absorb if–cbl, cbl
deficiency can be treated with a large dose of oral
cbl; the alternative is regular intramuscular
injections of cbl.

the mechanism of cbl malabsorption noted
occasionally in patients with hypothyroidism
(ref. 37) is not known and it appears to depend
on the severity of the disease. on the basis of
animal studies, malabsorption of cbl in this
disorder appears to involve a deficit of the if–cbl
receptor (ref. 38).

structure and cellular expression of the
cbl transporters if and tc ii
molecular cloning and gene structure analysis of
the human cbl transporters if, tc ii and hc
have revealed that these three proteins are
derived from a common ancestral gene by gene
duplication, despite the localisation of the genes
encoding if and hc to chromosome 11 (refs 33,
39) and that encoding tc ii to chromosome 22
(ref. 40). it is not known whether the tc ii gene
was also originally located on chromosome 11 or
whether chromosome 22 was originally the
location of all three genes. the genes encoding
these transporters are of approximately 20 kb
length, contain an identical number of exons of
approximately the same size, but many of the
highly conserved hydrophobic regions of these
proteins are localised to different exons. in
addition, four out of eight intron–exon boundaries
are at identical locations, with the other four
located in very close proximity.
sequence alignment analysis at both cdna
(refs 41, 42) and genomic levels (ref. 40) has
provided some novel insights into the structure
of these proteins. although the overall homology
between if, tc ii and hc is only about 30%, there
are several regions in their sequence containing
10–15 residues where the homology is much
higher, with nearly 60–80% identity. in addition,
these proteins contain conserved cysteine residues
at six identical positions. in bovine tc ii these six
conserved cysteine residues have been shown to
form three intramolecular disulphide bonds
(ref. 43) and they appear to influence cbl binding
in vitro. however, more-recent studies (ref. 44)
using in vitro mutagenesis of human tc ii and
transfection in human fibroblasts have shown that
whereas two of the three disulphide bonds,
c98–c291 and c147–c187, affected both in vitro
cbl binding and in vivo stability of tc ii, the
third disulphide bond, c3–c249, had no role in
cbl binding, stability or secretion of tc ii. it is
likely that, similar to tc ii, both if and hc
also form three intramolecular disulphide
bonds as these might be required to protect the

highly homologous cbl-binding region(s) from
proteolytic degradation.
on the basis of these structural comparative
studies, it is very likely that the cbl-binding
regions in these proteins evolved before their
different receptor-binding regions. although the
entire if or tc ii molecule might be essential for
high-affinity binding of cbl, binding to their
respective receptors might utilise shorter regions
within their structures. the initial receptorbinding ( xxxg557xxx -binding) region of if is localised
to residues 25–62 at the n-terminal region
(ref. 45), where there is very little homology of
if with other cbl-binding proteins. however,
other contact points of if with its receptor might
develop after this initial binding (ref. 46). this is
not surprising since  xxxg557xxx  is a polyvalent protein
with multiple structural domains. the receptorrecognition region of tc ii has not been identified
yet, but preliminary studies indicate that the
binding site for tc ii-r is localised to the interior
of the molecule (b. seetharam et al., unpublished).
it is obvious from these studies that much needs
to be learned about the structure–function
relationship of these cbl transport proteins.
tc ii, which is not a glycoprotein, is secreted
in a constitutive manner from many human cells
in culture and in vivo, with endothelial cells
appearing to be the primary source of plasma
tc ii (ref. 47 and citations therein). tc ii is a
product of a typical housekeeping gene in that its
5'-flanking region lacks a discernable tata box,
contains multiple start sites and is gc-rich. the
differential levels of tc ii mrna noted in tissues
(ref. 48) might be related to relative ratios of the
transcription factors sp1 and sp3, both of which
bind to the gc/gt box (ref. 49). additional in
vitro transfection studies (ref. 50) have shown
that the physical interactions between sp1
(which binds to the gc box) and usf1 and
usf2 [transcriptional factors of the basic helix–
loop–helix (bhlh) family that bind to the e-box
from −523 to −528] might play a role in high
transcriptional activity of the tc ii promoter. in
addition to binding usf1 and usf2, the e-box also
binds to other members of the bhlh family of
transcription factors such as myc/max, mad/
max, and max/max, which transactivate many
oncogenes. this night partly explain the high
plasma tc ii levels noted in patients with some
forms of cancer (ref. 47).
by contrast to tc ii, which is expressed in
many cellular sites, cellular expression of the if

glycoprotein is limited to cells derived from
tissues originating from the foregut anlage, and
its secretion is regulated by a variety of factors
(ref. 9 and citations therein). sites of if synthesis
include gastric parietal (human), chief (rat) and
pancreatic duct (dog) cells. transgenic mice
experiments (ref. 51) using 1.1 kb of the 5'flanking region of mouse if gene fused with the
human  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  showed transgene
expression in the parietal cells, but not the chief
cells, although it is the latter that normally express
if in the mouse. these studies have underscored
the complexity of cell-specific expression of the
if gene, and further studies are required to
identify the cis–trans interactions that are
important in activation or suppression of the if
gene in any given type of gastric cell. hormones
such as cortisone (ref. 52) and  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx 
(ref. 53) are known to modulate if mrna levels
in rats; however, it is not known whether the
hormones directly affect transcription of the if
gene or exert their effects by altering the stability

of if mrna. table 3 summarises important
properties of these cbl-binding proteins.

structure and expression
in the 1970s and early 1980s, a cell-surface receptor
for if–cbl of molecular mass 200–230 kda was
identified and characterised from the terminal
ileal brush border membrane of a number of
mammalian species (reviewed in refs 9, 10 and
citations therein). in addition to the ileal
mucosa, work in the late 1980s and early 1990s
identified high-affinity if–cbl-binding sites in the
mammalian kidney (ref. 54) and murine yolk sac
(ref. 55). several later studies using isolated
kidney tissue (refs 21, 54, 56) demonstrated that
the if–cbl receptor was synthesised in the
kidney and was immunologically identical to
its counterpart in the intestine. moreover, as in
polarised intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells (ref. 3),

ligand interactions
 xxxg557xxx  is polyvalent in nature and has the ability
to bind to a structurally diverse set of ligands
(fig. 4) that include receptor-associated protein
(ref. 1), albumin (ref. 61),  xxxg173xxx /
high-density lipoprotein (refs 62, 63), transferrin
(ref. 64), immunoglobulin (ig) light chains
(ref. 65) and vitamin-d-binding protein (ref. 66).
although these proteins are normally largely
undetected in urine, their levels are elevated in
the urine of dogs and humans with ig syndrome.
two regions of  xxxg557xxx  – the n-terminal 113residue region and cub domains 6–8 – are
implicated in the binding of both if–cbl and
albumin. however, since these two ligands do
not compete for binding at both the regions, it is
likely that the two ligands bind to sites that are
spatially distinct in each region (ref. 67). it is
possible that similar spatial differences could exist
for the binding of other ligands, such as vitamind-binding protein. indeed, patients with ig
syndrome containing a missense mutation,
p1297l, in cub domain 8 that decreases the
affinity for if–cbl (ref. 19) failed to excrete
vitamin-d-binding protein or 25(oh)-d3 in their
urine (ref. 66); however, there was an increase in
the urinary excretion of vitamin-d-binding
protein and 25(oh)-d3 in patients with an intronic
mutation that resulted in the introduction of a
premature termination codon and truncation of
the  xxxg557xxx  molecule (ref. 18).

cobalamin transport proteins and their cell-surface receptors

the apically expressed receptor in polarised
opossum kidney cells was able to internalise
if–cbl and mediate transcellular transport of
cbl (ref. 57). furthermore, studies using a
family of dogs with selective inherited intestinal
malabsorption of cbl (ref. 20) demonstrated that
the receptor expression in the brush border of
both intestine and kidney was inhibited in
these animals (ref. 21). these results initially
suggested that both intestinal and renal receptors
are under similar types of regulation and thus
could be the products of the same gene. the earlier
estimates of molecular mass for if–cbl receptor
in the range of 200–230 kda were based on its
mobility on denaturing electrophoresis – a
method that is not accurate for determining the
molecular mass of heavily glycosylated proteins
whose mass is greater than 200 kda.
in 1998, an 11.2 kb gene encoding a protein of
molecular mass of 460 kda that bound if–cbl
with high affinity was cloned (ref. 2). the linear
structure of this protein,  xxxg557xxx , consists of three
structural domains: a 113-residue n-terminal
region, followed by eight epidermal growth
factor (egf)-like repeats and a tandemly arranged
cluster of 27 cub domains (fig. 3). cub is an
acronym for ‘complement clr/cls, uegf and
bone morphogenic protein-1’ (ref. 2). each
cub domain consists of about 110 amino acids
and such domains are found frequently in
developmentally regulated proteins such as bone
morphogenic protein (ref. 58), tolloid protein
(ref. 59) and spermadhesin (ref. 60).

figure 4. functional topography of  xxxg557xxx . a
proposed model for the functional orientation of
 xxxg557xxx  and  xxxg1342xxx  in the apical membranes of
polarised epithelia.  xxxg557xxx  is shown associating
(dashed line) with the transmembrane protein
 xxxg1342xxx  via the n-terminal domain of  xxxg557xxx  ( xxxg557xxx 
itself lacks a transmembrane domain, but might
interact with the membrane via palmitoylation).
several ligands are known to interact with the cub
domains, and in some cases binding regions on
 xxxg557xxx  have been identified: cub domains 6–8 are
important in binding of if (intrinsic factor)–cbl,
albumin, transferrin and  xxxg870xxx ;
cub domains 13–14 are important in binding to
receptor-associated protein. the locations of
alternative sites for if–cbl and albumin at the nterminus are also shown. the sites of two disease
mutations (fm1 in cub8 and fm2 in cub5) identified
in finnish patients are indicated by stars (fig004bsw).

is thought to have other functions, such as aiding
in the trimerisation of the  xxxg557xxx  molecule
(ref. 68) and interacting with  xxxg1342xxx  (ref. 38),
both of which could be important for making
peripheral contact with the lipid bilayer (fig. 4).
indeed, despite its role in the endocytosis of the
many ligands it binds,  xxxg557xxx  itself has no
cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains (ref. 2).
the structural elements of the n-terminal region
of  xxxg557xxx  that make contact with the lipid bilayer
are not known, but palmitoylation in this region
might be involved as  xxxg557xxx  from opossum
kidney cells has been shown to be palmitoylated
(ref. 12). on the basis of the in vitro binding of
 xxxg557xxx  to the 600 kda endocytic receptor  xxxg1342xxx 
(ref. 2), it is suggested that both endocytosis of
the many ligands that bind to  xxxg557xxx  and its
own membrane recycling are assisted by  xxxg1342xxx 
(ref. 2). in addition,  xxxg1342xxx  is thought to be a
chaperone for the plasma membrane delivery of
 xxxg557xxx  (ref. 69).
in vivo evidence for the importance of the
 xxxg1342xxx – xxxg557xxx  interaction has been obtained
recently in whole-body-irradiated rats, which
developed severe albuminuria due to loss of
albumin and  xxxg1342xxx  but did not lose if–cbl
binding to  xxxg557xxx  (ref. 70). these observations
support the distinct nature of albumin- and
if–cbl-binding sites on  xxxg557xxx  and might help
explain why some patients with ig syndrome
exhibit proteinuria (i.e. both binding sites
dysfunctional) whereas others do not (only the
if–cbl-binding site dysfunctional). although
structural details of the  xxxg557xxx – xxxg1342xxx 
interaction are not known, the n-terminal region
of  xxxg557xxx , including the eight egf domains, has
been implicated as one of the regions important
in  xxxg557xxx  binding to  xxxg1342xxx  (ref. 38). loss of this
region as a result of increased proteolytic
conversion of the 460 kda form of  xxxg557xxx  in the
intestine of thyroidectomised rats resulted in
decreased association of  xxxg557xxx  with  xxxg1342xxx , as
well as decreased absorption and transport of
orally administered cbl (ref. 38). these studies
have underscored the importance of  xxxg557xxx –
 xxxg1342xxx  interactions in the apical brush borders
of kidney cortex and intestine but additional
studies are required to identify other regions of
 xxxg557xxx  that may interact with  xxxg1342xxx . such
studies will help increase understanding of how
 xxxg1342xxx  assists in influencing multiple ligand
binding, internalisation and membrane recycling
of  xxxg557xxx .

additional roles for  xxxg557xxx 
 xxxg557xxx  is an important molecule required for
renal tubular reabsorption of many filtered
proteins, vitamins and other ligands yet to be
identified. in the intestine, however, it is not
known whether  xxxg557xxx  has any function other
than cbl absorption. however, as a result of its
ability to bind to galectin 3 (ref. 71), a protein
that plays a role in cell adhesion and tumour
progression (ref. 72), intestinal  xxxg557xxx  might
play a role in regulating gastrointestinal cancers
(ref. 73) and in inflammatory responses (ref. 74).
 xxxg557xxx  is also expressed in the yolk sac (ref. 75)
and could play an important role in the endocytic
mechanisms that are important in nutrient
transport at the maternal–foetal interface.  xxxg557xxx 
is generally found in the perforin-containing
granules of the uterine natural killer cells and is
endocytosed via galectin 3 (ref. 71). thus,  xxxg557xxx –
galectin-3 interactions might be important in
uterine natural killer cell function and in the
development of the foetus. further investigations
into the structure–function relationship of  xxxg557xxx 
are required to understand how, by binding to
different types of ligands,  xxxg557xxx  might affect
intestinal and renal function and regulate foetal
development.

the tc ii receptor
synthesis, membrane expression and
interactions
tc ii-r is initially synthesised as a 45 kda protein
that is then heavily glycosylated to form a
mature protein of molecular mass 62 kda;
however, following its expression in the plasma
membrane, it forms a functional noncovalent
homodimer of molecular mass 124 kda (ref. 5).
dimerisation of tc ii-r is driven by membrane
fluidity; it occurs only in plasma membranes
where the phospholipid:cholesterol ratio is 10:1
and cholesterol–phospholipid interactions are
essential to keep the dimer intact (refs 76, 77).
tc ii-r dimer levels represent nearly 80–90% of
total tissue tc ii-r protein levels in rat tissues
tested, suggesting that at steady state most of the
tc ii synthesised is delivered to the plasma
membranes (ref. 78). mature tc ii-r contains four
intramolecular disulphide bonds that are essential
for its ligand binding, but not for its intracellular
stability or its trafficking from the endoplasmic
reticulum to the trans-golgi (ref. 79).
in addition to binding to tc ii-r, tc ii–cbl
also binds to  xxxg1342xxx  on renal tubular epithelial

expert reviews

in molecular medicine

cells (ref. 80). the binding appears to contribute
to tubular reabsorption of filtered tc ii, as
 xxxg1342xxx -knockout mice have elevated levels of
urinary tc ii (ref. 81). however, more-recent
studies (ref. 82) have shown that  xxxg1342xxx 
binds tc ii-r with higher affinity than it
binds tc ii–cbl. thus, it is unlikely that
 xxxg1342xxx  has a direct role in the tubular
reabsorption of filtered tc ii or in the plasma
delivery of tc ii–cbl to cells with very little or no
expression of  xxxg1342xxx .

endocytosis of tc ii–cbl in polarised
epithelial cells
in human kidney and intestinal mucosa, tc ii-r
activity and protein levels are distributed between
the apical and the basolateral membranes in the
ratio of 1:6 and, in polarised intestinal epithelial
caco-2 cells, tc ii-r is able to mediate endocytosis
of tc ii–cbl from both plasma membrane
domains (ref. 83). however, apically endocytosed
tc ii–cbl is transcytosed intact to the basolateral
side whereas basolaterally internalised tc ii is
degraded in the lysosomes and cbl is retained
and utilised by the cells. since orally administered
labelled tc ii–cbl also crosses the mucosal
barrier in rats (ref. 83), it might be possible to
deliver cbl bound to tc ii in patients who have
undergone surgery of either stomach or terminal
ileum or who are unable to synthesise tc ii.

regulation of expression
several earlier studies (reviewed in ref. 47 and
citations therein) have shown by cell-surface
tc ii–cbl binding that cell-surface tc ii-r activity
levels are upregulated to import more cbl when
the cells are in a proliferating mode. available
evidence using cultured lymphocytes (ref. 84)
and methionine-dependent p-60 human glioma
cells (ref. 85) have shown that cell-surface
tc ii-r levels are regulated by intracellular
methyl-cbl levels. when cultured in the presence
of homocysteine, an immediate precursor of
methionine, methionine-dependent p-60 human
glioma cells showed a sixfold and twofold
increase in tc ii-r activity and intracellular cbl
levels, respectively. these studies have indicated
that upregulation of tc ii-r might occur in cells
when intracellular methyl-cbl demand increases,
to meet increased demand for remethylation of
imported homocysteine to methionine. this
observation is interesting as it suggests that
upregulation of tc ii-r on the cell surface might

be a property of tumour cells, which are highly
proliferative and also dependent on methionine.
several more-recent studies have shown
that cell-surface tc ii-r expression is indeed
upregulated in cancer cells. these studies have
demonstrated: (1) the ability of a monoclonal
antibody against tc ii that blocks its binding to
tc ii-r to inhibit proliferation of leukaemic cells
(ref. 86); (2) the ability to detect small tumours in
rats (ref. 87) and humans (ref. 88) by whole-body
radioimaging using a radiolabelled cbl analogue
that was imported in higher amounts to these sites
in the body; and (3) a relationship between higher
import of radiolabelled cbl and increased tc ii-r
protein expression (ref. 89) in ovarian cancer
nih-ovcar-5 cells and tumour xenografts that
were obtained using nih-ovcar-5 cells in nude
mice.
interestingly, higher tc ii-r levels noted in
nih-ovcar-3 cells required  xxxg1140xxx 
treatment (ref. 89), a characteristic of a family
of cell-surface markers containing ig domains,
such as human leukocyte antigens hla-i and
hla-ii, beta2-microglobulin and carcinoembryonic
antigen. this raises the possibility that tc ii-r also
belongs to this family of proteins and contains an
ig domain. in support of this suggestion are recent
observations that have shown the binding of pure
human tc ii-r to bacterial igg-binding proteins
such as staphylococcus aureus protein a (ref. 90).
moreover, radiolabelled cbl uptake in human
cells was inhibited by both antiserum to the ig fc
region and by protein a. taken together, these
observations have indicated strongly that human
tc ii-r is an igg-like protein. however, further
studies are required to understand the structural
elements of tc ii-r and the role of igg-like
domains in tc ii binding and internalisation.
developmentally, tc ii-mediated uptake of
cbl has been shown to occur in germ cells
(ref. 91) and murine yolk sac (ref. 92), and
immunoblot studies using rat tissue membranes
from rats of different ages have shown that
t c i i - r protein levels are not temporally
regulated during postnatal development (ref. 78)
– although their tissue levels vary, being highest
in the kidney. tc ii-r protein and activity levels
and plasma transport of absorbed cbl to
peripheral tissues are regulated by the hormone
cortisone, as all three were drastically reduced in
adult adrenalectomised rats (ref. 78), an effect
that was completely reversed following cortisone
treatment of these animals. the physiological

in molecular medicine

relevance, if any, of prenatal expression of tc ii-r
in cbl transport to developing foetal tissues is not
known, and further studies are needed to
understand whether cortisone exerts its effect at
transcriptional or translational levels.

concluding remarks
rapid strides have been made in the past ten years
in understanding the molecular structure of cblbinding proteins and their cell-surface receptors.
these include the cloning of genes encoding if
and tc ii, establishing the molecular basis of
human tc ii deficiency, elucidating the structure
and many functions of  xxxg557xxx , and identifying
two receptors for tc ii and the functional
importance of normal tc ii-r (ref. 93). another
important dimension, particularly of  xxxg557xxx 
and tc ii-r, is their interaction with  xxxg1342xxx 
and the ability of  xxxg557xxx  to interact with galectin
3, an animal lectin important in cancer and
inflammation. further studies in this area should
focus on the structural analysis of these proteins,
particularly  xxxg557xxx  and tc ii-r, and the effects
of their gene disruption in health and disease.
