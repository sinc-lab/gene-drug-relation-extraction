division of endocrinology and metabolism (n.m., k.b.) and department of radiology (d.m.) nemours children’s clinic,

(e.l.) at  xxxd173xxx , wilmington, delaware 19850

context: use of aromatase inhibitors to suppress estrogen production is being actively investigated
in a variety of experimental conditions in both females and males.  xxxd173xxx  ( xxxd173xxx ) is a
potent and selective reversible inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme in females.
objective: our objective was to characterize the pharmacokinetics (pk) and pharmacodynamics
(pd) of  xxxd173xxx  in adolescent males with gynecomastia of less than 1 yr duration. the effect of
 xxxd173xxx  on breast size was also assessed as an exploratory aim.
design: we conducted a pk/pd open-label study.
setting: this clinical research center study was undertaken at pediatric academic centers.
patients: forty-two boys with gynecomastia (mean age 13 ⫾ 1.8 yr; duration of gynecomastia 7.0 ⫾
2.5 months; body mass index 28.3 ⫾ 5.9 kg/m2) were recruited.
interventions:  xxxd173xxx , 1 mg, was given daily for 6 months.
main outcomes: we assessed pk/pd of  xxxd173xxx  after 14 d daily dosing and changes in breast
size (exploratory aim) by manual tape measurements (area) and ultrasound (volume) after 6
months.
results:  xxxd173xxx  was rapidly absorbed orally (time to reach maximum concentration, 1 h) with
a slow apparent clearance of 1.54 liters/h and a terminal half-life of 46.8 h. testosterone/estradiol
ratios increased significantly with concomitant increase in lh/fsh concentrations indicating aromatase blockade. there was a reduction in breast area (⬃63%) and breast volume (⬃57%) in the
study group as compared with baseline (p ⫽ 0.004). the drug was well tolerated.
conclusions:  xxxd173xxx  is a potent aromatase inhibitor in adolescent males, with rapid absorption and slow elimination kinetics after oral dosing. exploratory analysis of changes in breast size
showed breast reduction in the cohort; this deserves further study. (j clin endocrinol metab 94:
2975–2978, 2009)

a

romatase inhibitors (ais) potently inhibit androgen to estrogen conversion in vivo and are presently approved in postmenopausal women with  xxxg1603xxx -positive breast cancer.
the use of ais has been studied in boys with certain disorders of
growth and puberty (1–5). to date, the pharmacokinetics (pk) of

only one ai, exemestane, have been studied in males (6). we designed this study to characterize the pk properties of the ai  xxxd173xxx  in adolescent boys with recent-onset gynecomastia.
gynecomastia is characterized by proliferation and hyperplasia of ductal epithelium and edema of the surrounding

pk/pd of  xxxd173xxx  in adolescent boys

stromal and connective tissue and is due in part to increased
sensitivity to circulating estrogen in puberty (7). boys with longstanding gynecomastia were unresponsive to 6 months  xxxd173xxx  (2), possibly due to development of dense breast fibrosis. by
selecting patients with relatively recent onset of the disease (i.e.
⬍1 yr) here, we sought to avoid the periductal fibrosis and hyalinization of more longstanding gynecomastia (8). the effect of
treatment on breast volume (ultrasound) and area (manual measurement) was an exploratory aim, with each subject serving as
his own control.

subjects and methods
informed written consent/assent was obtained before study entry after
institutional review board approval (clinicaltrials.gov nct00241436).

study subjects
boys aged 11–18 yr, with pubertal gynecomastia (at least one breast
ⱖ2 cm in diameter by ultrasound or calipers) for less than 12 months and
no decrease in 3 months before study entry were recruited. subjects had
to be pubertal, healthy and on no medications. subjects were recruited
from the endocrine clinics at two participating centers in florida and
new york.

study design
a physical and genital exam was performed at baseline. breast volume was determined using ultrasound at study entry and after 6 months
 xxxd173xxx . measurements included the transverse (crosswise), sagittal
(superior aspect of breast to inferior aspect of breast), and anteroposterior diameters of the glandular tissue deep beneath the sc fat to the
anterior chest wall using 10-mhz high-resolution ultrasound or equivalent transducers. subjects were supine and total breast volume calculated from combination of each breast. transverse and sagittal manual
measurements of the breast size (supine) were also performed using a
measuring tape.
subjects were then begun on 1 mg  xxxd173xxx  ( xxxd173xxx ;  xxxd173xxx ,
wilmington, de) orally daily and 14 d later admitted to the clinical
research center for a pk study. patients were kept on nothing by mouth
6 – 8 h before and 2 h after administration. blood plasma samples were
collected within 30 min and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and
24 h after  xxxd173xxx  administration and stored frozen at ⫺20 c until
analysis. subjects continued on  xxxd173xxx  daily for 6 months with interim visits at 3 months. blood samples for testosterone, estradiol,
shbg, lh, and fsh concentrations as well as complete blood count and
chemistry profiles were obtained at baseline and 3 and 6 months.
physical exam and breast ultrasound were also repeated at 6 months.

assays
 xxxd173xxx  plasma concentrations were measured at the  xxxd173xxx 
laboratories (alderley park, uk) using hplc with tandem mass spectrometry. in brief, human plasma containing the analyte and internal
standard were extracted using a liquid/liquid extraction procedure, and
samples were evaporated to dryness, reconstituted, and analyzed by
hplc equipped with an ab/mds sciex api 4000 mass spectrometer.
positive ions were monitored in the multiple reaction-monitoring mode.
quantification was by peak area ratio.
testosterone, shbg, lh, and fsh concentrations were measured
using bayer chemiluminescence kits (diagnostics products corp., tarrytown, ny), estradiol by ria with a limit of quantitation of 3.4 pg/ml
and an intraassay coefficient of variation (cv) of 4.3–12.3%. complete
blood count and chemistry profiles were measured using standard
analyzers.

calculations
outcome variables derived for each subject at steady state included
maximum and minimum  xxxd173xxx  plasma concentration, time to
reach the maximum concentration (tmax), area under the curve (aucss)
calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule, apparent oral clearance (cl/f)
calculated as dose/aucss, and apparent volume of distribution during
terminal phase (vz/f) calculated as dose/(aucssx␭z), where ␭z was the
terminal elimination rate constant calculated by log-linear regression of
the terminal portion of the concentration-time profiles. the pk analysis
and parameter estimations were derived using noncompartmental methods with winnonlin professional version 5.0 or higher (pharsight corp.,
mountain view, ca).
we evaluated the changes in breast size over time as an exploratory
aim. a positive response was defined as a more than 50% reduction
in the calculated volume (by ultrasound) of gynecomastia of both
breasts combined after 6 months study treatment. we also calculated
the change in breast area by manual measurement.

safety
we monitored the incidence and intensity of adverse events, laboratory assessments (including hormone levels and liver function tests), and
physical examination (including changes in testicular volume and tanner
stage).

statistical analysis
descriptive statistics were used, and geometric means (exponentiated
value of the arithmetic mean of log-transformed values) were used to
transform/normalize skewed data. in addition, the effect of baseline
characteristics, age, and weight on cl/f and vz/f was assessed using an
anova model, with log-transformed cl/f and vz/f as respective dependent variables. results were reported as p values for the covariates,
and coefficient of determination (r2), which describes the overall fit of
the model.
analysis of the changes in breast size and plasma concentrations of
different hormones were compared using student’s t test at a 0.05 significance level.
the intention-to-treat (itt) population included all patients with
baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. the per-protocol population included patients who followed protocol. data are
shown as mean ⫾ sd unless otherwise indicated.

results
patient population
forty-two subjects were enrolled from two centers (37 at the
nemours children’s clinic, jacksonville, fl; five at montefiore
medical center, new york, ny); 38 subjects received study
medication and were included in the safety population. the itt
population (n ⫽ 36) was used for the pk analysis, and the perprotocol population (n ⫽ 25) was used for pharmacodynamic
(pd) analysis.
mean age of subjects was 13 ⫾ 1.8 yr, 66% were white, and
mean body mass index (bmi) was 28.3 ⫾ 5.9 kg/m2. all were in
puberty. the mean duration of gynecomastia was 7.0 ⫾ 2.5
months (3–11 months).
pk

safety assessments
seventy-eight adverse events were reported by 30 patients in
the safety population (n ⫽ 38), including gastroenteritis and
upper respiratory symptoms. there were two serious adverse
events reported. one had bilateral slipped capital femoral epiphyses that required surgery after 4 months treatment. the patient
was morbidly obese (bmi, 34.3 kg/m2). study medication was
stopped then, and recovery was uneventful. the other serious
adverse event was gastroenteritis. puberty progressed normally.
liver function and clinical laboratory tests were normal. overall,
the drug was well tolerated.

discussion
this is the first study to assess the pk of  xxxd173xxx  in males. we
observed that the disposition of  xxxd173xxx  follows a multiexponential decay, with a rapid absorption (median tmax of 1 h)
and a rapid distribution phase. elimination characteristics indicate that  xxxd173xxx  was slowly cleared (1.54 liters/h), with a
terminal elimination half-life of 46.8 h.  xxxd173xxx  was extensively distributed with an apparent volume (vz/f) of 98.4 liters.
there was no effect of age and weight on  xxxd173xxx ’s apparent
oral clearance and no effect of age on volume of distribution.
however, there was an effect of weight on apparent volume of
distribution (p ⫽ 0.03). these kinetics are similar to those reported in pre- and postmenopausal women (9 –12).
as expected, gonadotropin concentrations and hence testosterone concentrations rose significantly after aromatase blockade. however, the latter was well within the normal range for
puberty and congruent with the increases in young men and
adolescent boys treated in open-label (13, 14) and randomized
(5) studies.
estrogen concentrations, on the other hand, did not show as
marked a suppression as other studies in males (5, 13, 14). this
is likely due to differences in assays. these studies used a sensitive
ria instead of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, a superior choice when measuring small concentrations in
plasma (15). however the marked increase in testosterone/estradiol ratio (more than that seen in pubertal progression) (5) is
good evidence of the level of aromatase blockade.
in pubertal boys with gynecomastia for more than 1 yr treated
previously with  xxxd173xxx  vs. placebo for 6 months (2), there
was no difference in response. however, successful treatment of
male pubertal gynecomastia with ais, including those with
aromatase excess (16, 17), have been reported, suggesting that
medical management is more likely to be successful early in the
course of this disorder during its proliferative phase (17), before
the development of fibrosis, stromal hyalinization, and duct dilation (8, 18). afterward, only surgical options are available
(18). in this study, the adolescents had less chronic gynecomas-

tia, and although there was not an untreated control group, interesting trends were observed. exploratory analysis of patients
with a at least a 50% reduction in total breast area after 6 months
showed 36.1% of patients had such a reduction by ultrasound
and 72.2% manually. it is possible that estrogen blockade may
be most effective before dense fibrosis of the breast tissue develops. this requires further study because there is a high spontaneous remission rate of pubertal gynecomastia in various epidemiological studies.
in conclusion,  xxxd173xxx  administration to adolescent
males shows a rapid absorption and distribution followed by a
slow elimination phase, similar to postmenopausal women. the
drug was well tolerated. exploratory analysis of the changes in
breast size in adolescents with gynecomastia of less than 1 yr
duration suggests that many patients have breast reduction while
on medication. although no therapeutic recommendations can
be made, these data support the need for further, well-controlled
studies in recent-onset gynecomastia using aromatase inhibitors.
