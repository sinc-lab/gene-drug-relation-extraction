abstract
purpose activating mutations in  xxxg792xxx  have been
identified as potential therapeutic targets in endometrial
cancer, typically occurring alongside genetic alterations
that disrupt the mtor pathway, such as pten loss. these
observations suggest that the mtor pathway may act in
concert with oncogenic  xxxg792xxx  to drive endometrial cancer
growth in a subset of patients. the aim of this study was to
examine the therapeutic potential of a rational drug combination based on the simultaneous targeting of mutant- xxxg792xxx 
and mtor-driven signaling pathways in endometrial cancer
cells.
methods  xxxd2985xxx  is an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits all 4 members of the fgfr
family.  xxxd3114xxx  is a selective inhibitor of mtor that
has demonstrated positive clinical activity in endometrial
cancer. the combinatorial effects of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  on growth of endometrial cancer models, and their
modes of action, were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.
results the combination of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx 
had a synergistic effect on the in vitro growth of endometrial lines bearing an activating  xxxg792xxx  mutation, irrespective of pten status. concomitant inhibition of both

 xxxg792xxx  and mtor signaling pathways was observed, with
simultaneous blockade resulting in enhanced cell cycle
arrest.  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  each demonstrated
inhibition of tumor growth in vivo, but dual inhibition by
the combination of agents resulted in superior efficacy and
induced tumor regression in an endometrial xenograft.
conclusions these encouraging preclinical findings suggest the inhibition of both  xxxg792xxx  and mtor by the  xxxd2985xxx – xxxd3114xxx  combination may provide a new
therapeutic strategy to treat advanced endometrial cancers
with dual pathway dysregulation.

introduction
endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological
malignancy in the united states with an estimated 40,000
new cases per year [1]. while patients with early-stage
disease exhibit a favorable overall prognosis, there are few
effective therapies for women with advanced or recurrent
endometrial cancer, for whom median survival is only
around 12 months [2]. endometrial tumors are characterized by a variety of genetic alterations, including somatic
defects found in the  xxxg792xxx 
( xxxg792xxx ) gene. indeed, three separate studies have identified  xxxg792xxx  mutations in approximately 10 % of endometrial tumors [3–5]. these mutations primarily occur in
the extracellular or kinase domains and lead to ligandhypersensitivity, receptor dimerization or constitutive
kinase activation. such activating mutations confer an
oncogenic stimulus to tumor cells, and endometrial cell
lines bearing these alterations have been shown to be
sensitive to fgfr kinase inhibition [4, 5].

dysregulation of mtor activity in endometrial cancer
is extremely common, occurring via mutation of upstream
regulators  xxxg1745xxx  (36 %),  xxxg2218xxx  (20 %),  xxxg2338xxx  (13 %)
and, most frequently, pten (50–83 %) [6–8]. interestingly, while  xxxg792xxx  mutations have been found to be
mutually exclusive with kras mutations, they are highly
associated with pten loss, as 77 % of tumors bearing
 xxxg792xxx  mutations also carry mutations in pten [9]. these
findings suggest that regulation of the pi3k/akt/mtor
pathway may act together with  xxxg792xxx  to drive endometrial cancer growth in a subset of patients.
 xxxd2985xxx  is an oral multitargeted  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor (tki), originally characterized for its ability to
potently inhibit bcr-abl [10–12] that is currently being
investigated in clinical trials in patients with chronic
myeloid leukemia (cml) and ph ? all [13]. we
recently demonstrated that  xxxd2985xxx  also potently inhibits
the activity of all four fgfr family members in vitro and
inhibits  xxxg792xxx  mutant endometrial tumor growth in vivo
[14].  xxxd3114xxx  ( xxxd3114xxx ,  xxxd3114xxx ), a non-prodrug
analog of rapamycin, is a selective inhibitor of mtor
currently under clinical investigation as a targeted cancer
therapeutic [15, 16]. preclinical studies have shown that
 xxxd3114xxx  exhibits inhibitory activity in a panel of
endometrial cancer cell lines in vitro and displays potent
antitumor activity in an endometrial xenograft model [17].
moreover,  xxxd3114xxx  has shown promising single-agent
activity in a phase 2 trial of advanced, progressive endometrial cancer [18]. taken together, these findings
prompted further exploration of the combined efficacy of
 xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  in this disease. here, we show
that simultaneous treatment of endometrial tumor cells
with  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  results in potent, synergistic antiproliferative effects both in vitro and in vivo.
these findings support the potential therapeutic value of
dual inhibition of  xxxg792xxx  and mtor signaling pathways as
a novel strategy for the treatment of patients with advanced
or recurrent endometrial carcinoma with defined molecular
characteristics.

phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 (thr202/tyr204) and phospho-frs2a
(tyr196), all from cell signaling technology (beverly,
ma).  xxxd2985xxx  ( xxxd2985xxx ) and  xxxd3114xxx  ( xxxd3114xxx ;
 xxxd3114xxx ) were synthesized at ariad pharmaceuticals
inc. (cambridge, ma).
cell growth assays and median effect analysis
cell growth was assessed using either celltiter 96 aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay (promega,
madison, wi) or cyquant cell proliferation assay kit
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). exponentially growing cell
lines were plated into 96 well plates and the effective
concentration at 50 % maximum inhibition (ec50) determined for both compounds in each of the endometrial cell
lines and defined as 19. cells were seeded for 24 h, and
combination treatments of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx 
were performed with fixed 1:1 ratios of the ec50 concentrations for each inhibitor. twofold serial dilutions above
and below the ec50 values ranging from 0.1259 to 89
were added to the cell cultures for 72 h. the nature of
the  xxxd2985xxx – xxxd3114xxx  combination interaction was
evaluated using the combination index (ci) method of
chou and talalay [19], and values were generated using
median effect analysis (calcusyn software; biosoft).
flow cytometric analysis
an3ca cells were treated for 24 h with 5 nm  xxxd3114xxx , 30 nm  xxxd2985xxx , 5 nm  xxxd3114xxx  ? 30 nm  xxxd2985xxx  or left untreated (control). the cells were harvested
and fixed with 70 % ethanol in pbs overnight at 4 °c.
fixed cells were washed and then sequentially incubated
with 50 lg/ml  xxxg1963xxx  (37 °c for 30 min) and 20 lg/ml
 xxxd3027xxx  iodide (room temperature for 30 min in the
dark). dna content was analyzed using a facsort flow
cytometer and cellquest v3.1 software (becton, dickinson and company). the percentage of cells in each phase
of the cell cycle was then estimated from the  xxxd752xxx -a
channel data using modfit lt for mac v2.0 software
(verity software house, inc.).

materials and methods
immunoblot analysis
cell lines, antibodies and reagents
the an3ca cell line was obtained from the american
type culture collection, and the mfe-296 cell line purchased from dsmz (braunschweig, germany). cells were
maintained and cultured according to standard techniques
at 37 °c in 5 % (v/v) co2 using culture medium recommended by the supplier. the following antibodies were
used: akt, phospho-akt (ser473), s6 ribosomal protein,
phospho-s6 ribosomal protein (ser235/236),  xxxg1369xxx /2,

123

an3ca cells were cultured with  xxxd2985xxx  (30 or 300 nm),
 xxxd3114xxx  (0.5 or 5 nm), a combination of both, or left
untreated (control) for 24 h. cells were harvested, lysed in
ice-cold sds lysis buffer, and protein concentration determined using a bca protein assay (pierce, rockford, il).
cellular lysates were resolved by electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted
with antibodies against total and phosphorylated forms of
 xxxg1369xxx /2, akt, s6 ribosomal protein and phospho-frs2a.

subcutaneous tumor model
all animal experiments were carried out under a protocol
approved by the institutional animal care committee.
endometrial cancer xenografts were established by the
subcutaneous implantation of an3ca cells (2 9 106) into
the right flank of female nude mice (nu/nu strain) (charles
river laboratories; wilmington, ma). for analysis of
efficacy, when the average tumor volume reached
*200 mm3, mice (n = 10 mice/group) were administered
the indicated doses of  xxxd2985xxx  at once daily oral dosing
for 21 days, or  xxxd3114xxx  at five daily consecutive
doses per week (qdx5) for 3 weeks by intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection or the combination of both.  xxxd2985xxx  was
formulated in aqueous 25 mm citrate buffer (ph = 2.75)
and  xxxd3114xxx  diluted in a vehicle of 10 % dma (n,ndimethylacetamide), 10 % tween 80 and 40 % propylene
glycol in water. single-agent groups were dosed in combination with the appropriate vehicle, and control mice
were dosed with both vehicles based on the route of
administration and schedule described above. mean tumor
volumes were calculated for each treatment group by caliper measurements using the following formula: tumor
volume = (length 9 width2)/2. statistical analysis for the
combination studies was evaluated using a two-sample
t test assuming unequal variances. the percentage of tumor
growth inhibition (% tgi) was calculated relative to
vehicle-only treated animals, and the percentage of tumor
regression was determined relative to tumor volume at the
start of dosing.
pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics
following an3ca xenograft tumor establishment, mice
were treated with a single oral dose of  xxxd2985xxx  (30 mg/kg),
a single i.p. administration of  xxxd3114xxx  (1 mg/kg) or
both, and tumors harvested 6 h later. individual tumors
were frozen upon collection, homogenized in phosphosafe lysis buffer (novagen, gibbstown, nj) and analyzed
by immunoblotting. inhibitor concentrations in plasma
were determined by an internal standard liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method using protein
precipitation and calibration standards prepared in blank
mouse plasma.

results
synergistic effects of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx 
on growth of  xxxg792xxx -mutant endometrial cancer cells
we have previously reported that  xxxd2985xxx  potently and
selectively inhibits the growth of endometrial cancer cells

1317

containing activating mutations in  xxxg792xxx  compared to cells
with native (unmutated)  xxxg792xxx  [14]. in this study, we
evaluated the combinatorial effects of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  on growth of two endometrial cancer cell lines,
an3ca and mfe-296, both of which contain an
fgfr2n549k mutation that results in constitutive, ligandindependent activation of the receptor. in addition, both
lines have been shown to be sensitive to the effects of fgfr
inhibition. these two lines do, however, differ in their pten
status with mfe-296 being wild type and an3ca lacking
pten expression due to mutations in both alleles [9].
the consequences of dual inhibition of  xxxg792xxx  and
mtor signaling on cell growth were examined using the
fixed dose ratio method of chou and talalay to determine
whether the interaction between  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  was antagonistic, additive or synergistic [19]. we
began by identifying the concentration of each compound
that affected a half-maximal inhibition of growth (ec50).
the ec50s for  xxxd2985xxx  was 30 nm and 100 nm and for
 xxxd3114xxx  was 0.4 and 1 nm in an3ca and mfe-296
cells, respectively (data not shown). to determine their
combinatorial effect, the dosing range tested was between
0.125 and 8 times the ec50 for each compound. as shown
in fig. 1a, the combination of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx 
exhibited a marked dose-dependent effect on an3ca and
mfe-296 growth compared to either compound alone.
median effect analysis confirmed that compound interactions in an3ca cells were highly synergistic, with combination index (ci) values of 0.31, 0.12 and 0.05 at the 50,
75 and 90 % effective doses (ed50, ed75, ed90),
respectively (fig. 1b, left panel). a robust synergistic
interaction was also observed in the mfe-296 cell line with
ci values of 0.45, 0.29 and 0.2 at the ed50, ed75 and
ed90, respectively (fig. 1b, right panel).
 xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  combination treatment
promotes cell cycle arrest in endometrial cancer cells
we next investigated the effect of the  xxxd2985xxx – xxxd3114xxx  combination on cell cycle progression in an3ca
cells. with both compounds, single-agent treatment led to
an accumulation of cells in the g1 phase, with a concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in s phase (fig. 2).
consistent with enhanced growth inhibition observed for
this line, the effect of the  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx 
combination was more pronounced compared to either
compound alone, resulting in near-complete g1 arrest by
24 h. indeed, the increase in the proportion of cells in the
g1 phase and the reduction of cells in the s phase were
both significantly different from either agent alone
(p \ 0.001). as evidenced by the lack of an increase in the
sub-g1 fraction,  xxxd2985xxx ,  xxxd3114xxx  or the combination of both displayed significant apoptotic activity.

pathway modulation by combined  xxxg792xxx  and mtor
inhibition

 xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  resulted in the complete inhibition of frs2a, erk and s6 phosphorylation (lane 9).
interestingly, increased suppression of s6 phosphorylation
was observed at the 0.5 nm  xxxd3114xxx  dose when in
combination with  xxxd2985xxx  (lanes 5–6). similar results
were observed in mfe-296 cells (fig. 3c).

in order to investigate the signaling consequences of dual
treatment with  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx , we examined
the levels of expression and phosphorylation of components of the  xxxg792xxx  and mtor pathways (fig. 3a). as
shown in fig. 3b (lane 1), the fgfr adaptor protein,
frs2a, as well as erk, akt and s6 are constitutively
phosphorylated in an3ca cells. treatment of an3ca
cells with 30 nm  xxxd2985xxx  resulted in complete inhibition
of p-frs2a and partial inhibition of p- xxxg1369xxx /2 (lane 2),
whereas 300 nm resulted in complete inhibition of both
targets (lane 3).  xxxd2985xxx  did not inhibit akt or s6
phosphorylation at either concentration. in contrast, treatment with 0.5 nm (lane 4) or 5 nm (lane 7)  xxxd3114xxx 
resulted in partial or complete inhibition of p-s6, but had
no effect on frs2a, erk or akt phosphorylation at
either concentration. importantly, the combination of

we next evaluated whether the synergistic interaction
between  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  in vitro translated to
increased antitumor activity in vivo using the fgfr2n549k
an3ca xenograft model. we have previously demonstrated that both  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  are efficacious as single agents when administered to mice bearing
an3ca xenografts [14, 17]. however, although significant
tumor growth inhibition was observed, neither compound
alone caused tumor regression. dosing regimens that

1319

inhibition of tumor growth was observed with each compound as a single agent (fig. 4a, b).  xxxd2985xxx  inhibited
tumor growth by 26 and 81 %  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg and 30 mg/kg,
respectively, and  xxxd3114xxx  inhibited tumor growth by
48 and 70 % at doses of 0.3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg (table 1).
the combination of low-dose  xxxd2985xxx  (10 mg/kg) with
either 0.3 or 1 mg/kg  xxxd3114xxx  resulted in significantly
increased tumor growth inhibition (p \ 0.05) of 84 and
88 % (fig. 4a) when compared to either agent alone.
moreover, the combination of high-dose  xxxd2985xxx  (30 mg/kg)
with either 0.3 or 1 mg/kg  xxxd3114xxx  induced tumor
regression (fig. 4b), with the combination of 30 mg/kg
 xxxd2985xxx  and 1 mg/kg  xxxd3114xxx  resulting in a 43 %
regression in tumor size (table 1). taken together, these
data indicate that the combination of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  results in enhanced antitumor activity in vivo,
exhibiting superior and potent antitumor activity compared
to either compound independently. importantly, the drug
combinations were well tolerated for the duration of the
study with no overt signs of toxicity. while up to 19 %
body weight loss was observed by the end of the treatment
with the highest combination dose (30 mg/kg  xxxd2985xxx 
plus 1 mg/kg  xxxd3114xxx ) (supplementary figure 1),
this was reversible upon treatment discontinuation (data
not shown).
to confirm target inhibition in vivo, mice bearing
an3ca xenografts were treated with a single oral dose of
vehicle, 1 mg/kg  xxxd3114xxx , 30 mg/kg  xxxd2985xxx  or all

recapitulate the clinical regimens were used for these
studies:  xxxd2985xxx  was dosed daily and  xxxd3114xxx  was

 xxxd2985xxx  reduced frs2a and erk phosphorylation and
 xxxd3114xxx  inhibited s6 phosphorylation. notably, dual
inhibition of both pathways was observed in mice treated
with the combination of 30 mg/kg  xxxd2985xxx  and 1 mg/kg
 xxxd3114xxx , a regimen that resulted in tumor regression
in the efficacy study (fig. 4b). pharmacokinetic analysis
showed that mean plasma levels of  xxxd2985xxx  (128–186 ng/
ml) and  xxxd3114xxx  (415–588 ng/ml) are in line with
previous studies showing that these levels are sufficient for
target inhibition [14, 16]. the incomplete inhibition of s6
phosphorylation seen in two animals was associated with

reduced plasma concentrations of  xxxd3114xxx  in both
cases (fig. 4c).

discussion
patients with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer face
a dismal prognosis, with median survival times of approximately 12 months [20] and an overall survival rate less than
8 % [21]. the standards of care for advanced disease are
cytotoxic chemotherapy, indicated as a frontline treatment
for most women, and hormonal therapy, which benefits only
a small group of patients [2, 20]. the underlying genetic and
molecular events that drive endometrial tumorigenesis have
led to the testing of targeted therapeutic agents, several of

which are currently under investigation either alone or with
conventional therapy [22]. despite this approach, at present,
there are no approved molecularly targeted therapies for this
disease [23].
in this study, we show that dual inhibition of constitutive  xxxg792xxx  signaling and mtor activity using  xxxd2985xxx 
and  xxxd3114xxx , respectively, resulted in potent synergistic antiproliferative effects in endometrial cancer cell
lines that contain activating mutations in  xxxg792xxx . median
effect analysis revealed that very strong synergy, defined
by ci values\0.1, was observed over a range of nanomolar
concentrations for each compound. further, the combined
treatment augmented the cytostatic response observed with
either compound alone, resulting in near-complete g1
arrest of endometrial cancer cells. the fgfr signaling
network consists of multiple pathways including  xxxg1369xxx /2
and pi3k/akt/mtor that are differentially activated
depending on the cellular context [24]. here, we show that
both erk and akt are constitutively activated in an3ca
and mfe-296 cells; however,  xxxd2985xxx  treatment only
inhibits  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling and not akt. these data suggest that the pi3k/akt pathway is regulated independently of  xxxg792xxx  in these cells and that this pathway may
provide alternative growth signals in the presence of fgfr
inhibition. the pi3k/akt pathway activates mtor and
consequently its downstream target s6, and as expected,
treatment of both cell lines with  xxxd3114xxx  resulted in
the inhibition of this pathway. it has been reported that
feedback activation of akt can occur in certain settings
with mtor inhibitors [25]; however, we did not observe
hyperactivation of akt with  xxxd3114xxx  in either cell
line. importantly, the  xxxd2985xxx – xxxd3114xxx  combination
blocked both pathways concurrently at synergic concentrations of each drug in both cell lines. these findings
imply that the synergistic activity is a result of horizontal
blockade of parallel signaling circuits [26].

the occurrence of  xxxg792xxx  mutations in endometrial
cancer has been associated with mutations in the tumor
suppressor gene pten [9], and pten-deficient tumors are
thought to be particularly sensitive to mtor inhibition
[27–29]. indeed, we have previously reported that the
pten status of endometrial cell lines is associated with
single-agent  xxxd3114xxx  activity, with pten-/- lines
being more responsive to the antiproliferative effects of the
compound [17]. however, here the combinatorial effect of
 xxxd2985xxx – xxxd3114xxx  was synergistic in both pten
negative (an3ca) and pten positive (mfe-296) cell
lines. this result suggests that fgfr2n549k acts as the
dominant proliferative driver in these cells and that  xxxd3114xxx  can potentiate  xxxd2985xxx  activity in cells with
constitutive akt activity independent of pten loss.
an important finding of this study was that antiproliferative effects of the combination observed in vitro
mirrored synergistic antitumor activity in vivo. using the
an3ca xenograft model, the low-dose combination
( xxxd2985xxx  10 mg/kg and  xxxd3114xxx  0.3 mg/kg) exhibited
a similar reduction in tumor size as the single-agent  xxxd2985xxx  high-dose group (30 mg/kg). overall, the results
indicated that an equal or greater level of efficacy was
achieved with lower concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx  when
combined with  xxxd3114xxx . moreover, the combination
of  xxxd2985xxx  (30 mg/kg) with both doses of  xxxd3114xxx 
(0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg) resulted in tumor regression, which was
not observed with either agent alone. importantly, combination dose levels shown here to be active in the an3ca
xenograft are equivalent to those previously shown to be
active in models of t315i-mutant bcr-abl-driven
tumors for  xxxd2985xxx  [11] and sarcoma tumors for  xxxd3114xxx  [17], and such preclinical studies have translated to
observed clinical activity in patients [13, 30]. additionally,
the combination was well tolerated in mice with no signs of
overt toxicity at all efficacious doses.
in summary, we provide the first demonstration that
simultaneous blockade of mutant  xxxg792xxx  and mtor
activity results in strongly synergistic antiproliferative
effects, increased efficacy, and tumor regression in preclinical model of endometrial cancer. notably, our results
provide further support for targeting activating mutations
in  xxxg792xxx  for this malignancy, and based on the present
data,  xxxg792xxx  mutational status is likely to predict for those
patients most likely to respond to combination therapy.
importantly, the concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd3114xxx  required to inhibit fgfr and mtor, respectively,
are clinically achievable in patients [13, 16]. moreover,
exploiting the specific molecular characteristics of this
disease has helped identify a novel combination strategy to
potentially improve the antitumor activity of an mtor
inhibitor already showing clinical promise. taken together,
our findings provide strong support for the exploration of

the  xxxd2985xxx – xxxd3114xxx  combination as a novel therapeutic approach for patients with advanced or recurrent
endometrial tumors with defined molecular characteristics.
