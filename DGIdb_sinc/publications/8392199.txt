dol-induced head-twitch response in 5-htrreceptor supersensitive mice. pharmacol biochem behav 45(2) 269-274, 1993.--it was recently reported that acute cocaine pretreatment can reduce the (+)-l-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (dol)-induced 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-ht2)-receptor mediated head-twitch response ( xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx ) in mice via
indirect stimula6on of adrenerglc a2- and serotonerglc 5-htia-receptors. the aim of the present investigation was to determine
whether cocaine can alter the doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  in 5-ht2-receptor supersensitive mice. supersensitivity was induced by a
single injection of doi 48 h prior to experimentation. these supersensitive mice exhibited a greater frequency of  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  to a
challenge dose of doi 48 h after its initial administration. cocaine pretreatment dose-dependentiy reduced the doi-induced
 xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  in the supersensitive mice. the stimulant was approximately four times more potent in the 5-htz-receptor supersensitive
mice relative to its reported effects in normal mice. receptor blockade studies with yohimbine and aiprenolol revealed that
both of the inhibitory components of cocaine's actions (i.e., adrenergic c~2-and serotonerglc 5-ht~^-receptor effects, respectively) were more efficient in reducing the doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  in supersensitive mice compared to normosensitive animals.
the present results further support the previously suggested hypothesis that acute cocaine administration inhibits the 5-ht2receptor function by increasing the synaptic concentration of norepinephrine and serotonin via inhibition of their uptake and
therefore indirectly stimulating the respective inhibitory adrenerglc a2- and serotonerglc 5-ht~^-receptors.

the stimulant cocaine inhibits the uptake of dopamine and
norepinephrine to potentiate the actions of these catecholamines (10,19,27,29). despite the vast animal and clinical research in the past two decades, the intricate neurochemical
mechanisms that maintain cocaine abuse are not well defined
(41). it has become more clear that a single neurotransmitter
or neuroanatomic system cannot solely account for the complex behavioral, biochemical, and electropltysiologlcal actions
of cocaine. nonetheless, increased dopamiuerglc activity appears to be the basis of many of its effects (3-5,10,19,29,30).
however, a more recent biochemical review suggests that cocaine also exerts a powerful influence over the serotonin neuronal system that is more pronounced than on dopamine and
norepinephrine neurochemistry (41). a newly published behavioral study supports this notion because repeated administration of low doses of the stimulant potently enhanced the

5-ht~^-receptor

a2-receptor

functional sensitivity of several 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)
receptors (14). moreover, a variety o f recent electrophysiological (11,12) neuroendocrine (31), self-administration (7,8,32),
and in vivo voltametric neurochemistry combined with behavioral studies (5) strongly indicate the importance of serotonerglc components of cocaine's actions.
biochemical and behavioral studies have characterized up
to four different distinct types of receptor sites in the serotonerglc superfamily of receptors (21,39). moreover, some o f
these receptors (e.g., 5-ht0 appear to be heterogeneous and
consist o f a number of subtypes (5-ht~^, 5-ht~s, 5-htic,
and 5-htid). the 5-ht receptor system is involved in the
modulation o f important physiological processes such as appetite, blood pressure, sexual behavior and sleep. disturbance in the function o f these receptors has been linked to cns
disorders such as aggression, anxiety, depression, migraine,

and neurodegenerative disorders (21). although selective radioligands do not exist for many of these receptor sites and
some sites are too newly discovered to have had their pharmacology investigated in any detail, a number of behavioral,
biochemical, and physiological models have been developed
for studying the functional activity of many of these sites (22).
the most widely used behavioral model to study changes in
the 5-ht,-receptor function is the head-twitch response
( xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx ) in rodents. although the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  can be produced by
different neurotransmitter mechanisms (25), the head-twitch
produced by the selective or nonselective (direct and indirect)
5-ht2-receptor agonists is antagonized by selective 5-ht2receptor antagonists (17,34).
it has been known for more than a decade that stimulation
of the noradrenergic receptor system can modulate the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx 
induced by 5-ht agonists [for a review, see (25)]. in particular, excitation of noradrenergic ,,-receptors dose-dependently
attenuate the 5-ht2-receptor-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx . these inhibitory
,2-adrenoceptors appear to be postsynaptic because clonidine
suppression of 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  was not
reduced by 6-hydroxydopamine pretreatment (26). activation
of either adrenergic /51- or 8,-receptors do not produce the
 xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx ; however, their stimulation can enhance the frequency
of serotonergically induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  [for a review, see (25)].
moreover, the/3-receptor antagonists (selective and nonselective) do not affect the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  produced by the 5-ht2-receptor
agonists. thus, /~-adrenoceptor effects appear to be purely
facilitatory (25). more recently, several investigators have
shown that a functional interaction exists between 5-htia and
5-ht2-receptors such that simultaneous costimulation of 5htia receptors is inhibitory to 5-hte-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  (1,17).
further, darmani et al. (14,18) have reported that acute cocaine administration dose-dependently attenuates the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  induced by the "selective" and nonselective 5-ht,-receptor agonists. this inhibition in the 5-ht,-receptor function appears
to be due to indirect stimulation of the inhibitory adrenergic
,e- and serotonergic 5-htl^-receptors via the inhibition of
uptake of endogenous norepinephrine and serotonin by cocaine.
to further characterize the contribution of the indirect inhibitory components of cocaine's acute actions on the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx ,
one can selectively induce supersensitivity in 5-hte-receptor
function prior to administration of the stimulant. in a recent
study, it was shown that a single injection of the 5-ht~/ic
agonist, ( ± )- 1 - (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)- 2- aminopropane
hci [(±)-doi], can induce tolerance at 24 h but supersensitivity at 48 h prior to a challenge dose of doi (15). this
supersensitivity persisted up to 6 days following the initial
doi administration. thus, the purpose of this investigation
was to evaluate the acute inhibitory effects of cocaine on the
doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  48 h following an initial injection of doi.
method

animals and drugs
male albino mice of the icr strain, bred in the animal
facilities of the kirksville college of osteopathic medicine,
were used throughout the study. at the time of experiments,
animals weighed 18-22 g and were housed in groups of six on
a 12 l : 12 d cycle at a room temperature of 22 ± i°c with
ad lib supply of food and water. all experiments were performed between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. the following drugs
were obtained from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo):
 xxxd123xxx  tartrate and yohimbine hci. doi was purchased

from research biochemicals, inc. (natick, ma). cocaine hci
was obtained from the national institute on drug abuse.

experimental protocols
the dose-response effects of acute administration of cocaine on doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  in normosensitive mice has already been published (18). to determine the inhibitory doseresponse effects of the stimulant on doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  in
5-ht2-receptor supersensitive mice, two groups of animals
were initially injected with either distilled water (n = 7, ip)
or 2.5 mg/kg doi (n = 35, ip). doi-treated animals were
then randomly divided into five different groups (n = 6-7).
forty-eight hours following the initial injection, each animal
was randomly transferred to a 40 × 25 × 16-cm plastic cage
lined with wood chippings. animals were allowed 10 min to
acclimate to the test environment. the water-pretreated group
(normosensitive control) received a second injection of distilled water l0 min prior to administration of a 2.5-mg/kg
dose of doi. immediately following doi injection, the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx 
frequency was scored at 2-rain intervals for the next 20 min.
mean scores (± sem) for every 2-rain time period were calculated. the doi-pretreated groups received either water (supersensitive control, n = 6) or different doses of cocaine (0.5,
2.5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, ip, n = 7) following the acclimation
period. ten minutes later, these animals were injected with a
second dose of doi (2.5 mg/kg) and the induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  was
scored as described earlier. stimulation of serotonergic 5ht~a- and adrenergic az-receptors can attenuate the doiinduced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  in normosensitive mice (see the introductory
section). thus, their corresponding antagonists,  xxxd123xxx 
and yohimbine, were used for the determination of the indirect inhibitory actions of cocaine (via inhibition of uptake of
serotonin and norepinephrine) in 5-ht,-receptor supersensitive mice. therefore, a large group of mice were made supersensitive by a 48 h prior treatment with a single injection of
doi (2.5 mg/kg, ip). these animals were then randomly divided into seven groups. forty-eight hours following the initial
doi injection, each animal was allowed to acclimate to the
test environment 10 rain prior to the initiation of drug interaction studies. the control mice (group 1, n = 6) received an
ip injection of distilled water following the acclimation period
and 10 rain later each control mouse was injected with a 2.5mg/kg dose of doi. the doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  was scored for
20 min as described for the dose-response studies. yohimbinetreated mice received either yohimbine alone (0.1 mg/kg, n
= 6) (group 2) or a mixture of 0.5 mg/kg cocaine plus 0.1
mg/kg yohimbine (group 3, n = 6) or a mixture of 20 mg/
kg cocaine plus 0.1 mg/kg yohimbine (group 4, n = 5). ten
minutes later, each mouse received an ip injection of doi
(2.5 mg/kg) and the induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  was scored as described
for control mice. the remainder of the 5-ht,-receptor supersensitive mice received  xxxd123xxx  (10 mg/kg, ip) following
habituation to the test environment. twenty minutes later,
group 5 (n = 6) received an injection of distilled water
whereas groups 6 (n = 6) and 7 (n = 6) were treated with
either a 0.5- or a 20-mg/kg dose of cocaine (ip). ten minutes
later, each animal received doi (2.5 mg/kg, ip) and the induced behavior was scored for the next 20 rain as described
earlier. the dose and dosing schedules are based upon our
previous findings (13,14,17,18).

the same doi dose 48 h earlier) produced a 97% increase in
the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  frequency (61 ± 5) for the same observation period
(fig. 1). relative to the normosensitive group, the cumulative

lowest cocaine dose tested (0.5 mg/kg) significantly reduced
the total  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  score in supersensitive mice (61 ± 5) by 33%
(41 ± 3) in the 20-rain observation period. in these mice, the
cumulative  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  frequency exhibited significant decreases co
< 0.05) from the supersensitive control group from the
eighth-minute observation time interval and persisted
throughout the experiment. the 2.5-mg/kg cocaine-dose reduced the total  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  score by 44% co < 0.05) and the significance o f difference was apparent from the 6-rain observation
interval. the 10- and 20-mg/kg cocaine doses further reduced
the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  score by 75 and 84%, respectively. the significance
o f differences were apparent from the 2-rain time period for
each case.
a dose o f 0.1 m g / k g yohimbine had no significant effect
(63 ± 5) on the doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  frequency in supersensitive mice (61 ± 5) (fig. 2). a combination of 0.5 mg/kg cocalne plus 0.1 mg/kg yohimbine also failed to modify the
induced head-twitch score (fig. 3). however, a dose of 20 m g /
kg cocaine plus 0.1 mg/kg yohimbine significantly reduced
the doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  by 84% (fig 3). the significance of
difference was apparent as early as the fourth minute of observation. the extent o f total reduction in the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  frequency
was the same as that produced by the 20-mg/kg cocaine dose
when the effect o f the stimulant by itself was investigated on
the doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  (e.g., fig. 1).

discussion

although initial cocaine use can produce a feeling of well
being and a decrease in anxiety (20), chronic abuse or administration of high doses of the stimulant can induce clinical anxiety as well as other psychiatric problems (33). such anxiogenic
effects are also evident in rodents following acute and chronic
cocaine exposure (38,42). the anxiolytic effects of serotoncrgic 5-ht2-receptor antagonists have been demonstrated both
in animals (2,40) and man (9,37). moreover, it has been suggested that 5-ht2-receptors play a permissive role in anxietylike behaviors and downregulation of these receptors consistently results in anxiolytic effects (38). in addition, the 5-ht]a
agonists that possess anxiolytic activity can attenuate 5-ht2receptor function in rodents (1,17). thus, investigation of the
acute and chronic effects of cocaine on the serotonergic receptor systems can help to delineate the possible mechanisms
through which the cocaine-induced animal and clinical anxieties are expressed.
acute cocaine pretreatment has been shown to dosedependently attenuate the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  in mice when the behavior was
produced by either selective or nonselective 5-ht2-receptor
agonists (14,18). this attenuation in the induced behavior
appears to be due to functional interactions between: a) adrencrgic ct2- and serotonergic 5-ht2-receptors; b) serotonergic
5-ht~^- and 5-ht2-receptors. cocaine causes indirect stimulation of the inhibitory adrenergic cq- and serotoncrgic 5-htiareceptors by increasing the synaptic concentrations of these
bioamines (18). the increase in synaptic dopamine level does
not affect the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  score because dopamine receptors are not
involved in the modulation of the head-twitch behavior (25).
darmani and coworkers (14) have further shown that chronic
administration of low doses of the stimulant enhances the

5-ht2-receptor-induced head-twitch frequency, probably via
a persistent decrease in synaptic concentration of 5-ht. repeated cocaine administration has the potential to alter the
functional capacity of many receptor systems (14,23,24).
thus, to characterize the acute effects of cocaine on the headtwitch behavior in 5-ht2-receptor supersensitive animals and
reduce the possibility of altering the functional sensitivity o f
other receptor systems, the 5-ht2-receptor was selectively sensitized by pretreating test animals with a single injection of
the 5-ht2/~c agonist doi 48 h prior to actual experimentation
(15). in such treated animals, a challenge dose of doi produced a greater frequency of the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx . several investigators
(6,16,36) have previously reported that acute administration
of a moderate dose o f doi does not alter the 5-ht2-receptor
density or affinity 24-48 h following its injection. further,
even chronic administration of doi does not alter the adrenergic c~2- and serotonergic 5-htl^-receptors (6). it seems that
the induced increase in the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  frequency to a challenge dose
of doi is probably due to a specific alteration in the sensitivity
of the 5-ht2-receptor signal transduction mechanisms (13,15).
similar to published studies (13), the present results show that
a challenge dose of doi 48 h following its initial administration caused a significant increase (970/o) in the frequency o f
the  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx . in such supersensitive mice, acute cocaine pretreatment dose-dependently reduced the doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  score.
cocaine is 3.6 times more potent in inhibiting the induced
behavior in 5-ht2-receptor supersensitive mice (ids0 = 3.3
mg/kg) relative to the normosensitive group [ids0 = 11.8 rag/
kg; (18)1.
pretreatment with the adrenergic c~2-receptor antagonist,
yohimbine (0.1 mg/kg), was shown to prevent the cocaine (20
mg/kg)-induced attenuation of  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  in normosensitive mice
(18). similar to the latter report, in this study yohimbine pretreatment by itself failed to affect the doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx . in
the present investigation, however, yohimbine under the same
experimental conditions failed to antagonize the effects of a
20-mg/kg cocaine dose on the doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  in supersensitive mice. indeed, a similar degree of attenuation (84%) was
observed in cocaine-only-treated (control) supersensitive mice.
however, yohimbine did prevent the 35% inhibitory effects
of a smaller dose of cocaine (0.5 mg/kg) on the doi-induced
behavior. these results indicate that in the presence of ct2receptor blockade in 5-ht2-receptor supersensitive mice, the
inhibitory 5-ht~a component of cocaine's actions has a more
prominent role in the attenuation of doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  relative to its minor role in normosensitive mice.
in normosensitive mice, the 5-htrreceptor antagonist  xxxd123xxx  (10 mg/kg) was shown to partially prevent the inhibitory effects of a 20-mg/kg dose of cocaine on the doiinduced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  (18). presently, in supersensitive mice  xxxd123xxx 
(10 mg/kg) failed to prevent the inhibitory component of cocaine's (20 mg/kg) effects. moreover, even the low dose o f
cocaine (0.5 mg/kg) in the presence of  xxxd123xxx  reduced the
doi-induced  xxxg746xxx   xxxg2260xxx  frequency by a similar degree to that observed in cocalne-only-pretreated animals. these data suggest
that relative to normosensitive animals, 5-ht2-receptor supersensitive mice are also more responsive to the adrenergic t~2receptor inhibitory component of cocaine's actions. moreover, it appears that the inhibitory adrenergic t~2-receptor
effect of acute cocaine administration is more prominent than
its serotonergic 5-htia actions both in normo- and supersensitive mice. further, these inhibitory effects appear not to be
additive because cocaine-only-treated animals do not produce
a greater degree o f attenuation than those observed in the
presence of yohimbine or  xxxd123xxx .

cocaine and head-twitch response modulation
in summary, the present results indicate that 5-ht2-receptor supersensitive mice are m o r e sensitive to the inhibitory
influence o f cocaine via stimulation o f the inhibitory serotonergic 5-htia- and adrenergic a2-receptors. cocaine may also
affect the head-twitch frequency via various receptor systems
(25) by altering other neuronal mechanisms such as those o f
benzodiazepine-(35) and gaba-(28) receptors at high doses.

273

thus, a better understanding o f such receptor interactions can
lead to the development o f new therapeutic agents to combat
cocaine-induced psychiatric problems.
