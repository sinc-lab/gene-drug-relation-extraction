abstract the present investigation was carried out to
study the possible effects of quinacrine in modulating
cytoplasmic  xxxg1759xxx  (cpla2) mrna levels in
rat hippocampus after kainate treatment. injections of
kainate into the right lateral ventricle resulted in significant increases in cpla2 mrna levels in the hippocampus, at 3 days and 7 days after injection. the elevation in
cpla2 mrna levels is consistent with previous observations of increased cpla2 immunoreactivity in degenerating neurons and astrocytes at these times. rats that
received once daily intraperitoneal injections of quinacrine (5 mg/kg) after the intracerebroventricular kainate
injections showed almost complete attenuation of increased cpla2 expression, at both 3 and 7 days after
kainate injection. these results show that in addition to its
well-known effect of inhibition of pla2 activity, quinacrine could also inhibit cpla2 expression, and further
supports a role for pla2 in kainate-induced neuronal
injury.

introduction
cytoplasmic  xxxg1759xxx  (cpla2) is a 85 kda protein
that catalyzes the release of  xxxd208xxx  from the sn-2
position of glycerol moiety of glycerophospholipids. systemic administration of kainate to adult rats markedly
increases cpla2 immunoreactivity in degenerating neurons
of the hippocampus, 1 and 3 days after injection (sandhya et
al. 1998; farooqui et al. 2000). this increase in cpla2 immunoreactivity is accompanied by an accumulation of
4-hydroxynonenal (4- xxxg694xxx ) and a decrease in glutathione
immunoreactivity in neurons, suggesting that lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are closely associated with
kainate-induced neurotoxicity (ong et al. 2000a, 2000b).
the increase in cpla2 and 4- xxxg694xxx  after kainate treatment
can be blocked by treatment with quinacrine and cpla2specific inhibitors in organotypic hippocampal cultures (lu
et al. 2001a; farooqui et al. 2001). in addition, quinacrine
prevents a rise in cpla2 and 4- xxxg694xxx  immunoreactivity in
the rat lateral septal nucleus after fimbria-fornix transection,
supporting the importance of cpla2 in lipid peroxidation
damage after nerve transection (lu et al. 2001b).
the in vitro and in vivo observations that quinacrine
administration could reduce cpla2 immunoreactivity
suggest that quinacrine may have an effect in reducing
cpla2 expression itself, in addition to its well-known
effect as an inhibitor of pla2 enzyme activity. however,
so far, little is known about the possible regulation of
cpla2 mrna levels by quinacrine. the present study
was therefore carried out to study the possible effects of
quinacrine on modulating cpla2 mrna levels in rat
hippocampus after kainate injection.

materials and methods
kainate injections
eighteen male wistar rats, each weighing approximately 200 g,
were used. they were allocated to three groups of six rats each. the
first set of rats was used as experimental controls. they were

522
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1.2 ml of 7% chloral
hydrate, which was followed by exposure of the skull and
stereotaxic injection of phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) into the
right lateral ventricle (1.0 mm caudal to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral,
4.5 mm from the cortex) using a microliter syringe (hamilton co.,
reno, nv, usa). the rats were killed by chloral hydrate anesthesia
and decapitation 3 days or 1 week after injection (three rats at each
time point). the right and left hippocampi were quickly dissected
out and kept frozen until analysis.
the second set of rats received intraperitoneal injection of
0.2 ml saline 30 min before anesthesia, and injection of kainate into
the right lateral ventricle (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo, usa,
1.0 l of a 1 mg/ml solution in pbs). this procedure resulted in
seizures after the rats had recovered from the anesthesia. the rats
then received once daily intraperitoneal injections of 0.2 ml saline
up to the time of being killed at 3 days or 1 week after kainate
injection (three rats at each time point).
the third set of rats was treated in the same way as the second,
except that they received, instead of saline, intraperitoneal injections of 0.2 ml  xxxd3061xxx  (sigma-aldrich, 5 mg/
ml in saline, equivalent to a dose of 5 mg/kg) 30 min before the
kainate injection, and daily intraperitoneal injections of quinacrine
(5 mg/kg) after the kainate injection. this dose of quinacrine was
chosen based on the results of a previous study (dubin et al. 1982).
in that study, quinacrine appeared in monkey brain 24 h after
intrauterine injection, indicating that it is metabolically stable and
can cross he blood-brain barrier (dubin et al. 1982). the rats were
killed at either 3 days or 7 days after kainate injection (three rats at
each time point). all procedures involving animals were in
accordance with guidelines of the medical faculty animal care
and use committee.
synthesis and radiolabeling of probes for cpla2, triose
phosphate isomerase (tpi) and b-actin
a cdna library was synthesized from rat pancreas by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). the cdna
library was then used to generate probes for cpla2, and ‘housekeeping genes’ triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) and b-actin using
pcr. the sets of primers for the pcr reactions, with fragment size
in parentheses, were as follows:

overnight. they were then washed at high stringency [2 standard
saline citrate (ssc)/0.1% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  (sds), 0.2 ssc/
0.1% sds, and 0.1 ssc/0.1% sds at 60c for 15 min] and
exposed to x-ray film at –80c for 3 days. this was followed by
phosphoimaging and densitometric measurement of bands using a
bio-imaging analyzer (fujifilm, tokyo, japan). the blots were then
stripped by incubation in 0.1% sds for 1 h, and exposed to x-ray
film overnight to ensure that there were no residual probes. they
were then re-probed for tpi, analyzed, stripped and re-probed again
for b-actin. the densities of the cpla2 bands were normalized by
dividing by the densities of the tpi or b-actin bands in each lane.
the value in the left or right hippocampus (whichever was lower)
of pbs-injected control rats was designated as unity (1). the results
were subjected to statistical analysis using one-way anova with
bonferroni’s multiple comparison post hoc test. p<0.05 was
considered significant; p<0.01, very significant.

results
kainate induces increases in cpla2
mrna levels (fig. 1, table 1)
injections of kainate into the right lateral ventricle
resulted in increases in cpla2 mrna levels in the
hippocampus (fig. 1). three days after kainate injection,
the cpla2 mrna level in right hippocampus was
increased 7- or 8-fold above the control basal level when
normalized against tpi or b-actin (table 1 set d vs b,
p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). a smaller, non-significant increase of 4- or 6-fold above control levels was
observed on the left side.
the level of cpla2 mrna remained significantly
elevated above control 7 days after kainate injection. in

as expected, cpla2, tpi and b-actin pcr-amplified dna were
detected as 523, 450 and 253 bp dna fragments respectively. pcr
products were resolved on 1.4% agrose gel in tris-borate-edta
buffer with 0.2 ng/ml ethidium bromide. the bands were then cut
and purified using qiaquick gel extraction kit (qiagen gmbh,
hilden, germany). samples of 100 ng cpla2, tpi or b-actin pcr
fragments were then radiolabeled with 32p using a random priming
labeling system (amersham pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj,
usa).
northern blot analysis
total rna was isolated from the hippocampal specimens using the
method of chomczynski and sacchi (1987). the rna samples
showed discrete 28s and 18s ribosomal rna bands on gel
separation, indicating the integrity of the samples. ten micrograms
of total rna was denatured by glyoxal, separated on a 1% agarose
gel in 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.0) and transferred,
overnight, to a nylon filter. the filters were hybridized with the 32plabeled oligonucleotide probe for cpla2 diluted in expresshyb
solution (bd bioscience clontech, palo alto, ca, usa) at 60c

the right hippocampus, the cpla2 mrna level was 3- or
5-fold above control when normalized against tpi or  xxxd3440xxx  (table 1 set d vs b, p<0.05 in both cases). in the
left hippocampus, the cpla2 mrna level showed a
significant increase of 4-fold above control level at this
time, when normalized against b-actin (table 1 set c vs
a, p<0.01).
quinacrine abolishes kainate-induced increases
in cpla2 mrna levels (fig. 1, table 1)
kainate-induced increase in cpla2 mrna levels was
abolished when rats were treated with kainate plus
quinacrine (fig. 1). at 3 days post-kainate injections,
the cpla2 mrna level in the right hippocampus was 2fold above the control basal level when normalized
against tpi or b-actin (table 1 set f vs b, no significant
difference, ns). the left side showed an increase of 2fold above the control basal level when normalized
against either tpi or b-actin (table 1 set e vs a, ns). a
similar result was obtained  xxxd2274xxx  days postinjection. in
kainate-plus-quinacrine-injected rats, the cpla2 mrna
level in the right hippocampus was 1 or 2-fold above the
control level when normalized against tpi or b-actin,
respectively (table 1 set f vs b, ns), and that in the left
side was 2-fold above the control basal level (table 1 set
e vs a, ns). all the above differences were not
significantly different from controls.
at 3 and 7 days after kainate injections, the cpla2
mrna level in the right or left hippocampus of kainateplus-quinacrine-treated rats was also significantly less
than for those injected with kainate and saline, when
normalized against tpi or b-actin (table 1 set f vs d, and
set e vs c, p<0.01). the above results indicate that
quinacrine abolished kainate-induced elevations in cpla2
mrna levels.

discussion
injections of kainate into the right lateral ventricle
resulted in increases in cpla2 mrna levels in the
hippocampus of both sides at 3 and 7 days after injection.
the increase in cpla2 mrna levels at 3 days is
consistent with our previous study showing induction of
cpla2 immunoreactivity in degenerating neurons in the
hippocampal fields 3 days after kainate injection (sandhya et al. 1998). the increase in cpla2 mrna levels in
both hippocampi after kainate injection is consistent with
histologic findings of bilateral damage to the hippocampi,
after intracerebroventricular kainate injections (ong et al.
2000b).
the increase in cpla2 mrna levels  xxxd2274xxx  days is likely
to be due to increased expression of cpla2 in reactive
astrocytes, since our previous experiments have shown
that neurons have undergone degeneration, and that large
numbers of cpla2-immunopositive reactive astrocytes
are present in the degenerating ca fields at this time
(sandhya et al. 1998).
in contrast to animals that had been injected with
kainate plus saline, animals that had been injected with
kainate plus quinacrine showed an almost complete
inhibition of cpla2 expression. the effect of quinacrine
in inhibiting cpla2 mrna increase was observed at both
3 days and 7 days after kainate injection. since cpla2
immunoreactivity was observed in degenerating neurons
and astrocytes, respectively, at these times (sandhya et al.
1998), these present results indicate that quinacrine was
able to inhibit both neuronal and astrocytic increases in
cpla2 mrna.
the inhibitory effect of quinacrine on kainate-mediated upregulation of cpla2 mrna levels may be due to
modulation of transcription factors.  xxxg1759xxx 
inhibitors inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced degradation
of the inhibitor-kba protein and nfkb activation (van
puijenbroek et al. 1999). this, in turn, could lead to
decreased expression of cytokines such as interleukin-1
and  xxxg2296xxx -a, which increase cpla2 gene

524

expression (wu et al. 1996; newman et al. 1997).
another possibility, in view of recent observations that
quinacrine binds to the activating protein-1 (ap-1)
binding site of dna (stuhlmeier 2001), is that binding
of quinacrine onto the ap-1 binding site of the cpla2
promoter (miyashita et al. 1995) could have interfered
with ap-1 binding, and resulted in a reduced level of
transcription of the cpla2 gene.
in conclusion, this study has shown that there is
increased cpla2 mrna expression after kainate-induced
neuronal injury, and that this increase is abolished by
quinacrine. since the increase in cpla2 is associated with
an accumulation of toxic lipid peroxidation products
including 4- xxxg694xxx  in the degenerating hippocampus (ong
et al. 2000b; lu et al. 2001a), these results suggest that
quinacrine may be useful as a possible therapeutic agent
to treat neurological disorders. any use of quinacrine,
especially in epilepsy, must, however, be approached with
caution since the drug commonly produces psychosis, and
occasionally seizures (rockwell 1968). further studies
are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by
which quinacrine affects cpla2 transcription.
