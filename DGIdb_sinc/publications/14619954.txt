abstract
studies on vinca domain binding drugs were done in great details by a number of workers as it is recognized as a potential
target for anticancer drug development. their structures, properties, mode of action, success and failures as potential anticancer drug have been discussed in short details in this review. among these drugs rhizoxin and maytansine are competitive inhibitors, and bind at the  xxxd3511xxx  binding site of tubulin where as others are non-competitive inhibitors. besides binding,
these drugs also differ in the extent of gtp hydrolysis, gtp exchange and in the stabilization of colchicine binding site. the
toxicity level of these drugs towards the host cells and the extent of efflux of drugs by the p-glycoprotein mediated pump are
also discussed. (mol cell biochem 253: 41–47, 2003)

introduction
the crucial role of the mitotic spindle in cell division has
identified itself as an important target for anticancer drug
development. microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins are the major constituents of the mitotic spindle. they
have highly polar structure favoring growth at the plus (+)
end and shrinkage at the minus (–) end. a phenomenon normally termed as dynamic instability [1, 2]. this dynamic
equilibrium can be affected by treatment with some agents
or under influence of some conditions, which shifts the equilibrium between tubulin polymerization and depolymerization.
as a result, an increase in the length of the spindle fiber is
observed in case of taxol, which promotes polymerization.
similarly colchicine and low temperature favors the reverse
process. in these above processes there is alteration in the
polymer mass. but from recent studies it is known that
these antimitotic drugs act through stabilization of microtubule dynamics at relatively low drug concentration rather
than simple polymerization or depolymerization of microtubules [2–6]. since microtubule dynamics are required for
chromosomal movements during anaphase of a cell division

in mitosis it can be inferred that the spindle must be a very good
target for anticancer drug development [7–10]. most of these
agents act by blocking cells in the g2/m stage of the cell cycle. their ultimate fate destined is apoptosis, a cell suicide
mechanism. many antimitotic agents have been discovered by
screening natural products from plants, animals, microorganisms and marine organisms. these drugs are classified according to their mode of action on the spindle that is on tubulin and
microtubules. one group of drugs promotes polymerization
and the others act as polymerization inhibitors. drugs belonging to these groups are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively.
among polymerization inhibitors,  xxxd3511xxx  and colchicine
binding sites and their mechanism of actions are fairly well established. here we don’t include the colchicine group of drugs
since colchicine has limited use in cancer therapy because of
its toxic effects on cells producing hemorrhage and necrosis [11]. in this review we discuss properties of a few antimicrotubular drugs, which bind to vinca domain of tubulin or
affect  xxxd3511xxx  binding and inhibit microtubules polymerization despite of having structural dissimilarities. their binding properties with tubulin, their failure and success as potential
anticancer drugs are being presented.

vinca domain binding drugs of plant
and fungal origin
 xxxd3511xxx  ( xxxd3511xxx )
 xxxd3511xxx  (fig. 1) derived from catharanthus (vinca) roseus
(alkaloid family) is a highly useful drug for the treatment of
certain malignancies. these effects are mediated by the interaction of this drug with tubulin/microtubule system. it
diminishes the microtubule dynamics by suppressing dynamic instability at both ends of microtubules [12]. it favors
the formation of spirals, tubules and paracrystals at high
concentrations [13, 14]. in all cases the normal microtubule
function is hampered. attempts to localize the binding site
for  xxxd3511xxx  to either alpha or  xxxg217xxx  of tubulin is achieved with
limited success. from the cross-linking studies with bifunctional crosslinking agents (n, n′-ethylene) bis-iodoacetamide it is observed that cysbeta239-cysbeta354 cross-linking
is enhanced by  xxxd3511xxx  but cysbeta12-cysbeta201 or cysbeta211 is inhibited.  xxxd3511xxx  also inhibits the hydrolysis of exchangeable
gtp bound to  xxxg2353xxx  giving indirect evidence pointed to
beta tubulin [15, 16]. finally, the fluorescent  xxxd3511xxx  derivative  xxxd3511xxx -4′ anthranilate, which retained its antimitotic
activity and has high quantum yield was used to localize the

tubulin/microtubules

 xxxd3511xxx  binding site on tubulin. tryptic digestion followed by
hplc identifies a single fluorescent peptide spanning the
region beta (175–213) [17]. the binding of  xxxd3511xxx  to tubulin is
rapid and there are 1–2 high affinity sites in addition to several low affinity-binding sites [18].  xxxd3511xxx  and colchicine don’t
affect each other’s binding rather  xxxd3511xxx  protects the colchicine binding site against decay [19]. as the presumptive  xxxd3511xxx 
binding site is nearby the taxol-binding site on tubulin (beta217–231) so taxol binding is inhibited by  xxxd3511xxx  [20]. this is
obvious because taxol binds to polymerized tubulin and  xxxd3511xxx 
induced conformational changes inhibit polymer formation.
but once stable polymer is formed  xxxd3511xxx  has no effect. all
vinca site ligands inhibit microtubule assembly but may be
subdivided by their ability to induce non-microtubule polymer of tubulin.  xxxd3511xxx  and vincristine induce the formation of
non-microtubular polymers while maytansine and rhizoxin
do not, but all of them bind at the same site (or at least overlapping sites).

rhizoxin
rhizoxin (fig. 2) is a 16 membered macrolide isolated as a
fungal product (rhizopus chinensis). its significant antitumor
activity resembles that of vincristine [21–22]. based on the
structure activity study of rhizoxin and its homologues it is
suggested that the molecular geometry of the macrocyclic
lactone ring of these compounds play an important role in
their binding to tubulin. tubulin possesses one binding site
for rhizoxin per molecule with an affinity constant of ka =
1.7 × 107 m–1 [23]. rhizoxin inhibits  xxxd3511xxx  binding to tubulin
very strongly as it shares it’s binding site with maytansine
which is not identical but may overlap with the  xxxd3511xxx  binding site. since ansamitocin-p3 belongs to a maytansinoid
group of compounds, rhizoxin is expected to share the same
binding site with maytansine. unlike  xxxd3511xxx , rhizoxin does not
induce tubulin aggregation even at very high concentration.
although, both rhizoxin and maytansine were shown to
bind to tubulin at the same site, rhizoxin is more effective
against human and murine tumor cells than maytansine [24].
it has been found that residue beta100 of tubulin is responsible
for rhizoxin sensitivity. tubulin containing asn at this position confers this sensitivity [25]. mutation of asn to ile makes
tubulin drug resistant as indicated by the reduced binding of
the drug [26]. photo affinity labeling using azidodansyl derivative of rhizoxin identifies peptide fragment of beta tubulin
containing residue 363–379 [27]. like colchicine, rhizoxinbinding site is near the alpha beta interface. recently rhizoxin
analogues in marine bacterial isolates of the genus pseudomonas have been identified. some common properties
exhibited by them are mentioned below.

tral overlap between tubulin emission and the absorbance
of these drugs. the quenching of fluorescence is due to the
fact that the vinca-site occupancy results in the conformational changes on the tubulin structure [28].
3. vinca-site ligands antagonize the unfolding of amphipathic
alpha-helix around beta-390 of tubulin induced by colchicine,
inhibiting proteolytic cleavage near beta-390 [29].

vinca domain binding drugs of marine
sponge origin
hemiasterlin
it has been found that naturally occurring small peptides of
marine origin have very good potential for inhibition of microtubule assembly [30]. many of them are active against
human xenograft tumors in immunodefficient mice [31, 32].
hemiasterlin (fig. 3) is an active member of this family.
hemiasterlin like  xxxd1925xxx , cryptophycin and phomopsin
a protects the colchicine binding activity of tubulin. their
binding sites are different from vinca-alkaloid binding site
and inhibit  xxxd3511xxx  binding in a non-competitive fashion
(ki = 2.0 µm) [33]. they impede nucleotide exchange on
tubulin resulting oligopolymer formation [33]. a comparative analogy can be drawn in this respect that  xxxd3511xxx  stabilizes
colchicine binding site less potently than peptide bond containing drugs (unpublished). in contrast, all drugs without
oligomer formation capacity e.g. maytansine, rhizoxin,
halichondrin-b, spongastatin are devoid of such colchicine
site stabilizing activity [34–36].

spongistatin (fig. 4) is a member of the macrocyclic lactone
polyether group of drugs which bind tubulin at the vincadomain. it has been isolated from an eastern indian ocean
sponge in the genus spongia sp. [37]. it inhibits microtubule
assembly, gtp/gdp exchange and gtp binding to tubulin
[38, 39]. it inhibits noncompetitively the binding of vinblas-

tine and  xxxd1925xxx  indicating the binding site to be different but located in the vinca domain of tubulin. using three
dimensional electron crystallography structure of alphabeta tubulin
dimer search for possible spongistatin binding domain gives
clue about the previously unidentified region of beta tubulin
which can accommodate large molecular volume of this drug
[40]. this proposed binding pocket of spongistatin is in close
proximity to the gdp exchange site on the beta tubulin. this binding pocket makes contact with the longitudinal interdimer
interface of the microtubules contributing to the tubulin depolymerization activity of spongistatin. from this modeling
data the interaction of spongistatin with the drug binding
pocket of tubulin identifies two spiroketal group of spongistatin as the critical component of binding.
based on this study derivatives of spongistatin, spiket
compounds are identified which have properties identical
with parent compound [41]. it is very potent against solid tumor
cell line derived from lung cancer, colon cancer, melanoma and
solid tumor.
halichondrin-b
this polyether macrolide (fig. 5) of marine origin was isolated from the marine sponge halichondria okadai and subsequently from a more unrelated sponge, axinella species [42].
homohalichondrin-b, a less potent derivative of halichondrin
was also isolated but for their reduced toxicity and very low
availability in comparison to halichondrin-b detailed studies were not done with this derivative. perhaps both of them
are of microbial origin that dwells inside the sponges. this
compound inhibits microtubules assembly in vitro and in vivo
and inhibits the binding of  xxxd3511xxx  to tubulin in a noncompetitive manner (apparent ki = 5.0 µm). it does not stabilize colchicine binding to tubulin like other noncompetitive
inhibitors of peptide origin ( xxxd1925xxx , phomopsin a [43].
halichondrin-b inhibits tubulin dependent gtp hydrolysis,

interferes with the exchange of gtp on  xxxg2353xxx  in a highly
temperature dependent fashion, being more extensive at low
temperatures. halichondrin-b and homohalichondrin-b inhibit the formation of intrachain cross links between two
sulfhydryl groups in  xxxg2353xxx  like phomopsin-a, dolastatin10, maytansine and  xxxd3511xxx  but are inactive to alkylation
by iodoacetamide [44]. another important effect of this drug
is that it enhances the exposure of hydrophobic areas of
tubulin whereas homo derivative of this drug, like  xxxd3511xxx , phomopsin a and  xxxd1925xxx  is inactive. therefore,
in spite of binding to the same ‘vinca-domain’, this group of
drugs also has differences in their behaviors towards tubulin
structure.
recently, the discovery of synthetic route for halichondrinb indicates that the antimitotic activity lies in the macrocyclic
lactone c1-c38 moiety. this important information helps to
develop synthetic analogues er-076349 and  xxxd2024xxx   xxxd2025xxx 
that retain the antimitotic activity of parent compound. er076349 and  xxxd2024xxx   xxxd2025xxx  differs in their c35 alcohol and amine
substituents respectively but the second is more potent than
the first. the reason behind this observation is that er076349 is metabolized more readily than the other compound
and binding of  xxxd2024xxx   xxxd2025xxx  is less reversible compared to the
other. this property makes them more effective for in vivo
experiments than  xxxd3511xxx  and paclitaxel when they are
used as internal standards [45].
 xxxd1925xxx 
 xxxd1925xxx  (fig. 6) is a pseudo peptide containing four
unusual amino acids and isolated from the marine shell less
mollusk dolabela auricularia but subsequently it has been
synthesized [46]. the apparent target of this drug is the protein tubulin. this peptide inhibits microtubules assembly
(ic50 = 1.2 µm) and arrests cells at the metaphase stage of cell
division. it is a non-competitive inhibitor of  xxxd3511xxx  binding and it also inhibits gtp exchange [47]. the binding stoichiometry of  xxxd1925xxx  with tubulin is not known very
clearly. attempts to isolate drug tubulin complex has been met
with a limited success. at low drug concentration, the dis-

tinct species obtained are complex containing two drug molecules per two molecules of tubulin dimers. at higher drug concentrations massive polymer of aberrant morphology (tightly
coiled spirals) are obtained [48].  xxxd1925xxx  is a potent
inhibitor of a number of cancer cell lines and is active against
human sarcoma, melanoma and ovarian xenograft in nude
mice. this drug leads to apoptosis by bcl-2 phosphorylation
[49, 50].
 xxxd1925xxx  has much more cytotoxic effect than  xxxd3511xxx  because of its 15–19 times more retention power within
the cell.  xxxd3511xxx  within the cell is subjected to rapid efflux than  xxxd1925xxx  in absence of atp indicating that the
entry of this drug is mediated through an active transport
process.  xxxd1925xxx  is accumulated within the cell through
passive diffusion and no detectable efflux is observed for this
drug for at least 2 h in a drug free medium [51]. the potency
of this drug is due to the better retention of this drug and
tighter binding to tubulin. like paclitaxel- xxxd2041xxx  combination therapy this drug also produces synergistic effect
when applied in combination with  xxxd377xxx  [52, 53].
 xxxd1925xxx  has undergone phase i/ii clinical trial [54].
this drug produces bone marrow toxicity and a set of local
reactions. peripheral neurotoxicity is another problem associated with this drug. microtubules are essential components
for axonal transport in neurons and this drug inhibits the function of schwann cells which limits this drug from repeated
applications. the failure of this drug despite showing antimitotic action in the clinical study is due to the lack of a balance
between efficacy and toxicity. so they have poor therapeutic
index.

vinca domain binding drug of microbial
origin
cryptophycin
cryptophycin (fig. 7) is an antimitotic compound isolated
from the cyanobacterium (nostoc species). the main target
of the cryptophycin action is the tubulin /microtubule system.
mt assembled in the presence of paclitaxel is stable upon
treatment with cryptophycin suggesting cryptophycin binds

to unpolymerized tubulin. several characteristics of cryptophycin binding to microtubule system are as follows. cryptophycin  xxxd1740xxx  dimer instantaneously to form
tubulin-cryptophycin complex. binding is temperature independent and irreversible. two types of binding sites are
observed for cryptophycin on tubulin [55, 56]. one high affinity-binding site along with a number of lower affinity binding sites. it inhibits the binding of  xxxd3511xxx  to tubulin in
a non-competitive fashion [57]. similarly, reversal of this
phenomenon that is the inhibition of cryptophycin binding on
tubulin is also observed by  xxxd3511xxx . in electron microscopy,
ring type of structures are visible during tubulin-cryptophycin
complex formation which is in contrast with the effect of  xxxd3511xxx  binding to tubulin which form spirals at high concentration. cryptophycin affects microtubule dynamics upon
binding to microtubule end as a cryptophycin-tubulin complex. microtubule dynamics is an important phenomenon
can be described as the continuous growth at one end accompanied by shrinkage at the other, a process known as
treadmilling. cryptophycin is the most potent drug known
so far which exerts its antimitotic action through stabilization
of microtubule dynamics. it binds to the end of the microtubule but not to its surface like paclitaxel that is known from
the study of panda et al. [58]. it has profound effect both on
the (+) and (–) end of the microtubule. it has influences on
the growth as well as on the rate and extent of the shortening
of the microtubules but the effect is more on the shrinkage
rate. it forms poorly reversible complex with tubulin and the
binding stoichiometry is 5 molecules of the drug per microtubule end [58]. at this dose it alters the polymer mass by only
15% but suppresses the dynamicity by 50% [58]. this explains the reason why this drug is so potent and capable of
exerting its antimitotic action at very low concentration. this
lower drug concentration is not only sufficient to stabilize microtubule dynamics but also not producing too much cytotoxicity for the host cell. it increases the time spent by the
microtubules in the resting stage by decreasing the shortening rate of the microtubules. cryptophycin is more potent
compared to  xxxd3511xxx  and rhizoxin and treatment of cells with
only 25 nm cryptophycin blocks paracystal formation initiated by 5 µm  xxxd3511xxx . importantly, cryptophycin is able to cir-

46
cumvent a common form of multiple drug resistance i.e. pglycoprotein mediated efflux of anticancer drugs. the apparent irreversibility of the effects of cryptophycin on
microtubules makes this drug useful both in vitro and in intact cells for structural studies.

conclusion
though vinca group of drugs comprise one important category of antimitotic drugs they are not free from limitations
such as sensitivity towards p-glycoprotein mediated pump
and poor therapeutic index. to minimize cytotoxicity towards
host cells they are used in combination therapy with other
drugs. development of several drugs (e.g.  xxxd1925xxx ) cannot be progressed further because of the associated peripheral neurotoxicity in cytoskeletal tubulin function. targeted
delivery of vincristine is sometimes attempted with the help
of liposomal formulations [59]. another novel approach is
to tag antimitotic agents with the antibody raised against a
specific tumor antigen. taxol group of drugs, though not covered in this review also suffers from similar type of problems.
besides its low solubility and complex chemical structure
difficult to modify, cells often develop resistance towards
taxol due to the variations in the isotype content and due to
the mutations in the beta tubulin gene. so new approaches
such as generating inhibitors of important cell cycle regulators such as different kinases (polo, bub and aurora),
adociasulfate-2 (a competitive inhibitor of kinesin motor
domain) and monasterol have been designed to combat the
problem of uncontrolled cell division and serve as potential
anticancer drug of future [60, 61].
