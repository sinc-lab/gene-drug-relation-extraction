abstract
this study was designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. patients were
randomized by center to placebo (16 patients, 31%), oral  xxxd330xxx  300 mg/m2/day (21 patients, 40%),
or oral  xxxd330xxx  600 mg/m2/day (15 patients, 29%) following demonstration of stable or responsive disease after first-line chemotherapy. the study was prematurely terminated because of slow accrual after 54
patients enrolled. median time to progression (ttp) from the beginning of study drug treatment was 56 days
for placebo, 82 days for moderate-dose  xxxd330xxx  (300 mg/m2/day), and 128 days for high-dose  xxxd330xxx  (600 mg/m2/day) (p = 0.56, log-rank test). for prior chemotherapy responders only, median ttp
from the beginning of study drug treatment was 56 days for placebo, 146 days for moderate-dose  xxxd330xxx , and 177 days for high-dose  xxxd330xxx . of note, there were more chemotherapy responders randomized to the placebo group (63%) than the  xxxd330xxx  treatment arms (48% and 47%), further supporting a  xxxd330xxx -related improvement in ttp.  xxxd330xxx -related toxicity was manageable and consisted
primarily of elevated serum triglycerides and asthenia, skin toxicity (dryness, peeling, flaking), thyroid dysfunction, and headache. because this study was closed prematurely, it does not have the statistical power
to detect differences among the treatment groups. this study shows that patients can tolerate  xxxd330xxx 
at initial doses up to 600 mg/m2/day after platinum-based chemotherapy and that  xxxd330xxx  may have the
potential to delay disease progression in patients with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer with previously
stable or responsive disease following platinum-based chemotherapy.

sis despite standard treatments with surgery, radiation, and
chemotherapy. advances in chemotherapy have resulted in only
modest gains in survival for this disease.2 combining chemotherapy and novel, biologically based, noncytotoxic treatments
may allow us to spare marrow toxicity and enhance efficacy,
which provides the rationale for conducting this trial with  xxxd330xxx .
retinoids play critical roles in normal development and physiology and are capable of inhibiting cell growth, inducing differentiation, and inducing apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell
lines. naturally occurring and synthetic ligands that have distinctive binding properties and transactivation effects on the
various  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar) and retinoid x receptor
(rxr) subtypes have been described, thereby allowing differential modulation of retinoid receptor gene expression.3 alltrans- xxxd3417xxx  (tretinoin, atra) binds to rars with high

affinity but does not bind to rxrs, whereas 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx 
( xxxd114xxx ,  xxxd3417xxx ) transactivates both rars and rxrs.4 in
leukemic cells, activation of rar pathways regulates cell proliferation and differentiation, whereas activation of rxr pathways
leads to the induction of apoptosis.5
 xxxd330xxx  has been identified as an rxr-selective ligand
that does not have significant rar binding and transactivation
of rar-responsive genes except at higher dose levels.6 in the rat
mammary carcinoma model, n-nitroso-n-methylurea was used
to induce tumors, and the tumors were allowed to grow to an
established size prior to initiation of treatment. in this model,
 xxxd330xxx -treated animals showed complete regression in 72%
of treated tumors and had a reduced tumor load compared to
control.7
 xxxd330xxx  capsule therapy was recently approved by the
food and drug administration for the treatment of cutaneous
lesions in patients with cutaneous t-cell lymphoma that is refractory to at least one systemic treatment.8 in one phase i study
with  xxxd330xxx , five of 16 patients with nsclc had stable disease on therapy for up to 394 days, with a mean of 132 days
suggestive of activity in nsclc.9 in another phase i study,
eight of 20 patients with nsclc completed at least 3 months
of therapy with  xxxd330xxx ; one of these patients remained
stable for 9 months of continuous therapy.10,11
 xxxd330xxx , an rxr-selective, synthetic retinoid, was therefore studied to determine whether administration at a high or a
moderate dose is more effective than placebo in prolonging time
to progression (ttp) in patients with stage iiib nsclc with
pleural effusion, stage iv nsclc, or recurrent nsclc who
had stable or responsive disease following first-line, platinumbased combination chemotherapy. two dose levels of  xxxd330xxx 
were tested to determine whether rxr-selective therapy (moderate dose) or rxr and weak rar agonist therapy (high dose)
is optimal. the higher dose level, 600 mg/m2/day, was chosen to
be near but below the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) for the
drug. the moderate dose level, 300 mg/m2/day, was very well
tolerated in phase i/ii studies. the rationale behind the study of
two dose levels was to evaluate if a dose response exists between
drug dose of  xxxd330xxx  and efficacy as assessed by progressionfree interval and to compare the tolerability and safety profile of
the two dose levels. further plasma levels achieved at 300 mg/
m2 daily suggest very selective rxr activation, whereas levels in
the range of 600 mg/m2 daily may confer a degree of panagonist
activation with full rxr activation and some degree of rar
activation.9,10

patients and methods
objectives
the primary objectives of this study were 1) to determine
whether oral  xxxd330xxx  administration at a high (600 mg/m2/
day) or a moderate dose (300 mg/m2/day) is more effective than
placebo in increasing the progression-free interval (ttp) in patients with stage iiib nsclc with pleural effusion, stage iv
nsclc, or recurrent nsclc who have stable or responsive
disease following first-line platinum-based combination chemotherapy; 2) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of  xxxd330xxx 

capsules when administered to patients with nsclc following
treatment with platinum-based combination chemotherapy;
and 3) to document objective antitumor responses to  xxxd330xxx  capsules in patients with measurable or evaluable nsclc
at study entry.
a secondary objective was to determine whether  xxxd330xxx 
capsule therapy at high or moderate doses prolongs survival in
comparison to placebo in this patient population.

patient characteristics
key inclusion criteria included 1) histologically confirmed
stage iiib nsclc with pleural effusion, stage iv nsclc, or
recurrent nsclc with stable or responsive disease (as determined by the investigator according to standard definitions) following platinum-based combination chemotherapy; 2) stable
disease or tumor regression following 3-6 cycles of first-line,
platinum-based (cisplatin or carboplatin) combination chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin was given in combination with
a taxane, etoposide, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or vinblastine
therapy, at the investigator’s discretion); 3) the last cycle of
chemotherapy must have been received within the previous 21
to 35 days; 4) previous adjuvant chemotherapy after initial primary therapy for localized disease, providing adjuvant chemotherapy was completed at least 6 months previously; 5) eastern
cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance status of
0, 1, or 2 with an expected survival of at least 3 months; and 6)
adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.
key exclusion criteria included 1) central nervous system involvement unless radiographically stable or improved after
whole-brain radiation, 2) prior therapeutic retinoid for
nsclc, 3) history of pancreatitis or clinically significant risk
factors for developing pancreatitis, and 4) an abnormal (greater
than upper limit of normal) baseline fasting triglyceride level
(ftg).

study design
this was a multicenter, phase ii/iii, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing two dose levels of
 xxxd330xxx  capsules to placebo in the defined study population.
patients and investigators were blinded to the drug assignment
( xxxd330xxx  or placebo) but were not blinded to the dose level
assignment (300 or 600 mg/m2/day). eligible patients who had
signed the informed consent document, which was approved by
the appropriate institutional review board, were randomized
according to a balanced code at the center to one of the following three arms: 1)  xxxd330xxx  capsules at 600 mg/m2/day as a
single daily dose, 2)  xxxd330xxx  capsules at 300 mg/m2/day as a
single daily dose, or 3) placebo capsules either 600 mg/m2/day
or 300 mg/m2/day as a single daily dose.

withdrawal, treatment-limiting toxicity, or death. date and
cause of death were to be obtained on all patients. patients
underwent tumor assessment at baseline, every 8 weeks during
treatment, and at study termination. patients who progressed
while receiving  xxxd330xxx  capsules or placebo were to be removed from the study. the primary efficacy endpoint of the

study was the progression-free interval time from study entry
(first study drug dose) to progressive disease. a secondary efficacy endpoint was overall survival from first study drug dose.
patients were not required to have measurable or evaluable
disease at the time of study entry. however, patients must have
experienced stable disease (sd), improvement (i), a partial response (pr), or a complete response (cr) following previous
chemotherapy for advanced disease prior to enrollment on the
protocol. tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks during treatment and at study termination according to the following conventional criteria: cr was defined as complete disappearance of all disease, pr was at least a 50% decrease in the
sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of index
lesions, and i (for those with evaluable disease only) was a decrease in the size of the evaluable lesion with concurrence of at
least two observers. these responses required confirmation by at
least two measurements separated by at least 4 weeks. stable disease was defined as not meeting the requirements for response
or for progressive disease.

number of patients planned
clinical experience with oral  xxxd330xxx  therapy in this patient population was limited at the start of this study. in order to
quantify the therapeutic benefits of  xxxd330xxx  in the treatment
of patients with nsclc, an interim assessment, utilizing the
group sequential procedure developed by o’brien and fleming,12

212

february 2001

was to be performed after the enrollment of 90 patients, with a
minimum of 3 months of follow-up for each patient (phase ii
portion of the study). the interim assessment was to determine
the comparative magnitude of the progression-free interval between the  xxxd330xxx  treatment arms and the placebo arm.
these findings were to be utilized to decide whether both doses
of  xxxd330xxx  would be pursued in the second stage of the study
(phase iii portion). the estimated differences between the  xxxd330xxx  treatment(s) were to be utilized to determine the sample
size required to properly power the study to establish the benefit
of  xxxd330xxx  over placebo.

results
fifty-four patients were entered between november 19, 1996,
and june 11, 1998; however, two patients did not receive the drug
and were considered not evaluable for safety or efficacy. all patients were off study by january 6, 2000, and survival was updated through january 4, 2000. table 1 summarizes the patient
characteristics according to assigned treatment group. the patients with stage iiib disease were distributed relatively evenly
among the three groups. although not statistically significant,
patients randomized to placebo had a higher incidence of response (cr+pr) to prior chemotherapy than the other two
groups. induction treatments, other than carboplatin/paclitaxel
(36 patients), included cisplatin/vinorelbine (seven patients),
carboplatin/vinorelbine (two patients), carboplatin/docetaxel

significant differences in response or survival. the response rate
ranged from 15%-21% and the median survival ranged from
7.4-8.2 months.13 unfortunately, this is no better than the 25%
response and 8-month median survival with  xxxd3513xxx /cisplatin,
which was published in 1988.2 with lung cancer responsible for
one third of all cancer deaths and accounting for more cancer
deaths than breast, prostate, and colon cancer combined, progress
is clearly needed in the treatment of this disease.1
the protocol described herein evaluated two dose levels of
 xxxd330xxx  capsules: a high-dose level, 600 mg/m2/day, that is
just below the mtd in patients with advanced solid tumors and
a moderate-dose level, 300 mg/m2/day, that was very well tolerated in phase i/iia studies and is the initial dose approved for
treatment of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma.8 in the absence of definitive phase ii data, this protocol was designed as a phase ii
study that could evolve into a phase iii study after determination of the appropriate sample size based upon the interim assessment and safety profile. a precedent for this type of protocol design in nsclc trials exists in the literature.14
the results of the study are suggestive that maintenance therapy with  xxxd330xxx  can confer a ttp advantage compared to
placebo in patients with advanced nsclc that previously
demonstrated responsive or stable disease with platinum-based
combination chemotherapy. the data also suggest that there is a
dose-response effect with the higher dose superior to the moderate dose of  xxxd330xxx . for patients with responsive or stable
disease after chemotherapy, survival is longer in a dose-responsive manner as well, but this is not statistically significant. the
survival in this study is longer than most with platinum-based
therapy, but this is probably due to the selection of patients for
those with stable or responsive disease.
in previous studies, plasma levels achieved at  xxxd330xxx  300
mg/m2/day suggest very selective rxr gene activation, whereas
levels in the range of  xxxd330xxx  600 mg/m2/day may confer a

214

february 2001

degree of panagonist activation with full rxr activation and
some degree of rar activation.9,10 this rxr:rar ratio of activation may be important for activity in nsclc and may explain the possible dose-response effect observed. in a recent
study, expression of retinoid receptors in paired specimens of
normal and cancerous tissue from the lungs of 76 patients with
nsclc was evaluated. in tumor cells, overexpression of rxralpha and  xxxg1931xxx  was observed and rxr-beta and rarbeta expression was decreased in 18% and 63% of tumor specimens, respectively.15 as such, the effect of a synthetic retinoid
on receptor subtypes may be a critical determinant of activity.
however, the mechanisms by which retinoids regulate differentiation and proliferation and induce apoptosis are complex and
incompletely understood. many other genes involved in tumor
cell differentiation and proliferation include  xxxd3417xxx  response elements in their promoters.16 retinoids play a central
role in tumor stroma production and may regulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases,17 transforming growth factorbeta,18 and cell cycle regulator proteins such as cyclin-dependent
kinase i, p16, or p21.19
a major limitation with the clinical application of retinoids
has been their toxicity.20 thus, the ratio of efficacy to toxicity,
termed the therapeutic index, has become an important consideration in assessing the potential clinical utility of different retinoids.21  xxxd330xxx  has been demonstrated to have the potential for a favorable therapeutic index with manageable clinical
toxicity up to the 650 mg/m2/day dose level. in phase i studies
with  xxxd330xxx , mucocutaneous toxicities, a frequent complication of rar-selective retinoids and panagonists, were minimal with  xxxd330xxx  and observed only at the higher dose
levels.22,23 although  xxxd330xxx  is an rxr-selective ligand,
weak rar binding and transactivation does occur, particularly
at higher doses, and may explain the mild cutaneous toxicity observed. both the moderate- and high-dose arms of  xxxd330xxx

were well tolerated and suitable for chronic administration. additionally, phase i data suggest that  xxxd330xxx  is less susceptible
to autoinduction of metabolism, which is also a limitation of
other retinoids. although  xxxd330xxx  plasma levels decreased
over time, the levels were maintained in the range considered active in preclinical studies.9,10
because this study was closed prematurely for administrative
reasons as accrual lagged behind initial projections, it does not
have the power to statistically detect small differences in ttp or
survival among the treatment groups. a trial to detect differences in ttp given the point estimates determined by this study
would require over 100 patients in each group. as demonstrated
by this study, a study of larger size would be difficult to conduct
because identifying patients who are responsive and enrolling
them within 4-6 weeks from last chemotherapy is problematic.
future trials may require entering all patients at the beginning
of chemotherapy and then treating only those with stable or responsive disease with  xxxd330xxx  or conducting combination
trials of standard therapy with or without  xxxd330xxx .

conclusion
 xxxd330xxx  is a novel synthetic rxr-selective retinoid agonist
that is unique from traditional retinoids with regard to preclinical and clinical activity, toxicity, and metabolism. this study
showed that patients can tolerate oral  xxxd330xxx  at initial doses
up to 600 mg/m2/day after platinum-based combination chemotherapy and that  xxxd330xxx  may have the potential to delay
disease progression in patients with advanced nsclc treated
with platinum-based combination chemotherapy. this delay in
disease progression appeared to be more impressive in those patients who demonstrated a response rather than stable disease
after chemotherapy. although these data are compelling, further
study in adequately powered clinical trials will be required to
confirm the usefulness of oral  xxxd330xxx  as maintenance therapy in nsclc.
