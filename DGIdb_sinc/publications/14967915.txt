effects of 17beta-estradiol and tamoxifen on the selenoprotein  xxxg946xxx  ( xxxg946xxx ) mrna expression in male re...  the selenoprotein  xxxg946xxx  ( xxxg946xxx ) is highly expressed in testes under gonadotropin control. the expression patterns of  xxxg946xxx  mrna by 17beta-estradiol (e2) as an estrogen and tamoxifen (tam) as an estrogen antagonist were investigated in the reproductive organs of male rats. twelve-week-old male sprague-dawley rats were subcutaneously injected with e2 (7.5 microg/kg/day) or tam (5 mg/kg/day) for 1 week. the e2 treatment significantly increased the levels of  xxxg946xxx  mrna in both testes and prostates, whereas the tam treatment significantly decreased the levels of  xxxg946xxx  mrna, compared to the vehicle control (p<0.01). the treatment with e2 or tam slightly decreased the levels of  xxxg946xxx  mrna in epididymides. in histopathological examination, severe vacuolization and depletion of germ cells in the seminiferous tubules, cell debris in the tubular lumen, and mild proliferative changes in interstitial tissues were observed in the testes of tam-treated rats, whereas only mild spermatogonial proliferation was observed in the seminiferous tubules of e2-treated rats. there were no typical histopathological changes in the epididymides of any of the laboratory rats but mild epithelial proliferation in the prostates of e2- and tam-treated rats. these results suggest that  xxxg946xxx  mrna expression may be influenced by estrogen in the male reproductive organs.
