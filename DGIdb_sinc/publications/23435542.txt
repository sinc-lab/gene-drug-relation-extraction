abstract
activation of muscarinic subtype 3 (m3) muscarinic cholinergic
receptors (machrs) increases airway tone, whereas its blockade
improves lung function and quality of life in patients with pulmonary diseases. the present study evaluated the pharmacological properties of a novel machr antagonist,  xxxd3468xxx 
(4-[hydroxy(diphenyl)methyl]-1-{2-[(phenylmethyl)oxy]ethyl}1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane;  xxxd3468xxx ). the affinity (ki) of
 xxxd3468xxx  for the cloned human m1–m5 machrs ranged
from 0.05 to 0.16 nm. dissociation of [3h] xxxd3468xxx  from the
m3 machr was slower than that for the m2 machr [half-life
(t1/2) values: 82 and 9 minutes, respectively]. in chinese hamster
ovary cells transfected with recombinant human m3 machrs,
 xxxd3468xxx  demonstrated picomolar potency (–log pa2 5 23.9
pm) in an acetylcholine (ach)-mediated ca21 mobilization assay.
concentration-response curves indicate competitive antagonism
with partial reversibility after drug washout. using isolated human

introduction
pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (copd) remain a leading cause of disability and death
while contributing to the global health burden. a primary
manifestation of copd is the inability of these patients
to achieve sufficient oxygenation of extrapulmonary tissues.
oxygen transport from the atmosphere to the alveolar spaces
for exchange to the bloodstream can be aided by dilating the
airways using pharmacological agents. some of these compounds are designed to block the activity of the muscarinic
cholinergic receptors, in particular the muscarinic subtype
3 (m3) muscarinic cholinergic receptor (machr), which is
highly expressed on the airway smooth muscle.

bronchial strips,  xxxd3468xxx  was also potent and showed
competitive antagonism (–log pa2 5 316 pm) versus carbachol,
and was slowly reversible in a concentration-dependent manner
(1–100 nm). the time to 50% restoration of contraction  xxxd1891xxx  nm
was about 381 minutes (versus 413 minutes for tiotropium bromide).
in mice, the ed50 value was 0.02 mg/mouse intranasally. in conscious guinea pigs, intratracheal administration of  xxxd3468xxx  dose
dependently blocked ach-induced bronchoconstriction with long
duration of action, and was comparable to tiotropium; 2.5 mg
elicited 50% bronchoprotection for .24 hours. thus,  xxxd3468xxx 
is a potent anticholinergic agent that demonstrates slow functional reversibility at the human m3 machr and long duration of
action in animal models. this pharmacological profile translated
into a 24-hour duration of bronchodilation in vivo, which suggested  xxxd3468xxx  will be a once-daily inhaled treatment of
pulmonary diseases.

maintenance of the caliber of the airway tree is supported
by the parasympathetic nerve fibers carried within the vagus
nerve. parasympathetic ganglia are associated with the larger
airways with postganglionic fibers innervating smallerdiameter bronchioles that are largely responsible for establishing resistance for airflow from the atmosphere to the
gas exchange units (for review, refer to canning and fischer,
2001). vagotomy or administration of atropine results in
bronchodilation in both animals and humans, suggesting that
the parasympathetic nerves are tonically active, and can
provide a persistent obstruction (canning and undem, 1994).
neural output from both parasympathetic cholinergic and
nonadrenergic, noncholinergic fibers affects airway smooth
muscle contractile activity. sympathetic fibers do not directly
innervate these effector cells, even though b-adrenergic
receptors are situated within their plasma membrane. transmission of the parasympathetic neural impulse to the airway

 xxxd3468xxx : a novel inhaled muscarinic cholinergic antagonist

materials and methods
machr binding. studies were conducted using membranes
prepared from chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells stably expressing
the human m1–m5 machrs. the cloning, heterologous expression,
and scale-up growth of cho cells transfected with machrs were
conducted according to previous methods (allard et al., 1987; peralta
et al., 1987; bonner et al., 1988; chapman and browne, 1990). the
cells were grown to confluence at 37°c in a humidified incubator
gassed with 5% co2/95% o2. the m2 and m4 machrs were coexpressed with the chimeric g protein, gqi5 (dong et al., 1995). cho
cells containing m1, m3, or m5 machr were cultured in alpha
minimum essential medium (mem) (gibco, green island, ny) with
nucleosides, l-glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum, whereas those
expressing m2 and m4 machrs were cultured in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium nutrient mixture f12 media (gibco) supplemented
with 200 mg/l  xxxg418xxx  ( xxxd2191xxx ) and 10% fetal calf serum. membranes
were prepared by centrifugation (1000g for 10 minutes at 4°c) and
washing the cell pellet with phosphate-buffered saline followed by
rapid freezing using liquid n2 and storage at 280°c (rominger et al.,
2009). the frozen pellet was thawed, resuspended in cold hypotonic
medium (40 mm tris, ph 7.5; 1 mm  xxxd2534xxx ; 0.5 mm edta; 1 mm
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 2.5 mg/l leupeptin; 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin), and incubated on ice for 5 minutes. the suspension was homogenized, centrifuged (2000g  6 minutes at 4°c), and the pellet
resuspended. this procedure was repeated twice, and the supernatants

were collected for centrifugation (100,000g  60 minutes at 4°c).
following resuspension of this pellet, aliquots were stored at 280°c
until the day of experimentation. protein concentration was quantified using the bio-rad protein assay (hercules, ca).
ligand binding assays with  xxxd3468xxx  and [3h]-n-methyl scopolamine (0.5 nm) were performed using a scintillation proximity
assay for m1, m2, and m3 machrs and a filtration assay for m4 and
m5 machrs. for the scintillation proximity assay assay, membranes
were incubated with wheat germ agglutinin beads in 50 mm hepes
buffer, ph 7.4, at 4°c for 30 minutes and then with the radioligand in
a 96-well optiplate (perkinelmer, waltham, ma) for 2 hours at room
temperature in the presence of vehicle [1% dimethylsulfoxide (dmso)]
or  xxxd3468xxx  (0.01–300 nm). at the end of the incubation, the plates
were centrifuged (beckman cs-6r; beckman coulter, brea, ca; for 5
minutes at 2000g), and radioactivity was counted (top count, model
a9912; packard, meriden, ct). for the filtration assay, membranes
(m4 and m5) were similarly incubated in hepes buffer containing
the radioligand for 2 hours at room temperature in the presence of
vehicle (1% dmso) or  xxxd3468xxx  (0.03–300 nm). atropine was used
as a reference agent. reactions were terminated by rapid filtration
(brandel cell harvester; brandel, gaithersburg, md) through gf/c
filters (glass microfiber binder free 1.2 m; whatman, kent, uk).
membranes were washed with ice-cold 50 mm hepes and transferred to scintillation vials. radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter (beckman model ls6500). reactions were terminated
by rapid filtration as described earlier. data were obtained from
three independent experiments. specific binding was determined by
subtracting nonspecific binding (using 0.3 mm atropine) from total
binding. the inhibition constant (ki) for  xxxd3468xxx  was calculated
according to cheng and prusoff (1973), where ki 5 ic50/ [l]/kd 1 1; kd 5
0.17, 0.28, 0.16, 0.07, and 0.2 nm for m1–m5 machrs, respectively,
and [l] is the assay concentration of radioligand. membranes containing m3 machrs were also incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with increasing concentrations of [3h]-n-methyl scopolamine
(0.08–9.24 nm) in the presence or absence of  xxxd3468xxx  (0.2–0.5 nm)
in 50 mm hepes, ph 7.4. nonspecific binding was determined using
10 mm atropine. the saturation data were converted to a scatchard plot
for analysis.
for kinetic measurements of [3h] xxxd3468xxx  or [3h]tiotropium,
membrane fragments from cho cells stably expressing human m2 or
m3 machrs were prepared as previously described (slack et al.,
2011). fragments were placed in 96-deep-well plates maintained at
37°c in medium containing 50 mm hepes buffer, ph 7.4, with either
[3h] xxxd3468xxx , [3h]tiotropium, or vehicle (2% dmso) and 10 mm
atropine for nonspecific binding and specific binding. after varying
incubation periods, binding was terminated by rapid vacuum filtration (brandel). the filtrate was collected on gf/b (glass microfiber
binder free 1.0 m, whatman, kent, uk) filter papers presoaked in
0.3% v/v polyethylenimine, washed three times with ice-cold medium,
and the filters were transferred into vials containing ultima-flo m
(perkinelmer, beaconsfield, uk) and analyzed using a tricarb 2900
tr ls counter (perkinelmer). specific binding of [3h] xxxd3468xxx  or
[3h]tiotropium was not found on cells lacking muscarinic receptors
(unpublished data). saturation binding of [3h] xxxd3468xxx  (∼0.01–2.4
nm) or [3h]tiotropium (∼0.01–2.9 nm) to m2 or m3 machrs was
determined after incubation for 24 hours. association rates of
[ 3 h] xxxd3468xxx  (∼0.02–0.43 nm) or [3h]tiotropium (∼0.02–0.38 nm)
to machrs were measured using incubation times up to 1 hour.
rates of dissociation of radioligand ([3h] xxxd3468xxx  ∼0.1 nm or
[3h]tiotropium ∼0.2 nm) were determined after incubation of membranes for 1 hour, diluted (1:20) with medium containing 10 mm atropine
and then incubated for varying times up to 24 hours prior to filtration.
the equilibrium dissociation constant (kd), total number of receptors
(bmax), association rate (kon), and dissociation rate (koff) were calculated using commercially available software (prism 5.0; graphpad
software, san diego, ca). a one-affinity site model was used to determine kd and bmax values. association binding data were globally
fitted to an association kinetic model for kon values, whereas dissociation

smooth muscle cells and consequent contraction occurs via the
release of acetylcholine (ach) and binding to the m3 machr.
of the five machrs, the  xxxg448xxx  is the most abundant on
the airway smooth muscle cell, whereupon its action opposes
b-adrenergic receptor–induced relaxation ( xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1996;
coulson and fryer, 2003). modulation of the release of ach is
also influenced by m2 machrs located on the prejunctional
fibers, where they exhibit an inhibitory influence. activation
of the m3 machr by ach initiates a cascade of signaling
events engaging g proteins (gq), inositol triphosphate, and
phosphoinositide phospholipase c with a consequent increase
in intracellular calcium and enhancement of airway smooth
muscle contraction (see for example chilvers and nahorski,
1990).
bronchodilator therapy has become the mainstay for controlling symptoms brought about by enhanced parasympathetic nerve activity in patients with bronchoconstrictive
pulmonary diseases such as copd and asthma (cazzola
et al., 2012). b-adrenergic receptor agonists and xanthines
have been available for many years for symptom relief of these
diseases. more recently, antimuscarinic cholinergic antagonists have been sought for the management of disease to
maintain airway caliber for adequate gas exchange (buschpetersen and lainé, 2011). to promote adherence to therapy,
those agents with a long duration of action are more desirable,
and to avoid systemic effects of these medicines, inhalation of
the compound has benefitted these patients. this study was
conducted to characterize the preclinical pharmacology of 4[hydroxy(diphenyl)methyl]-1-{2-[(phenylmethyl)oxy]ethyl}1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane ( xxxd3468xxx ; world health
organization– and united states adopted name–approved
term is  xxxd3468xxx ), a potent machr antagonist that was
designed to be used once daily via the inhaled route. although
this compound is a pan-active pharmacophore for each of the
five muscarinic receptors, the data are, for the most part,
derived from functional assay systems depicting m3 machr
responses.

the average cumulative tension attained was 1.58 6 0.14 g (n 5 33)
with no significant difference among the treatment groups. agonistinduced responses were expressed as a percentage of the response to
the reference agonist, histamine (1 mm), obtained at the end of the
experiment. mean pec50 and geometric mean ec50 values were
calculated from nonlinear regression analyses (motulsky and christopoulos, 2003). when appropriate, potency values of the antagonists
were expressed as pkb and pa2 (arunlakshana and schild, 1959),
where pkb 5 2log [antagonist]/x 2 1, x is the ratio of agonist
concentration required to elicit 50% of the maximal contraction in the
presence of the antagonist compared with that in its absence, and
pa2 5 2log of the antagonist dissociation constant. analysis of pa2
values was accomplished using global fitting of the data (motulsky
and christopoulos, 2003).
in separate experiments, human bronchial strips were similarly
suspended in superfusion chambers (coleman and nials, 1989; harvard
apparatus, inc., holliston, ma; connected to biopac tsd125c
transducers). these tissues, however, were continuously superfused
(2 ml/min) with krebs-henseleit solution throughout the experiment, while agonists and antagonists were infused (0.02 ml/min) via
a 22-gauge needle inserted into the superfusate in contact with the
tissue. after a 1-hour equilibration period, the tissues were continuously exposed to carbachol (1 mm) until the conclusion of the
study, when reference data were collected. upon reaching a sustained contraction,  xxxd2401xxx  (10 mm) was administered to reference maximal relaxation, and was stopped to allow restoration of
the carbachol-induced tension. muscarinic antagonists were infused
at a single concentration per tissue until reaching a sustained
relaxation, about 6 hours, to ensure a state of equilibrium at the
lower antagonist concentrations, and tissues were rinsed of drug
for 10 hours. at this time, carbachol infusion was stopped to permit recovery of basal tone, and then a carbachol crc was obtained,
followed by a 1-mm histamine-induced reference contraction. figure 1
shows the experimental paradigm used in these studies to measure
the time to 50% of maximal relaxation produced in the presence of
the machr antagonists, referred to as on t1/2, and upon removal
of drug, i.e., their ex vivo duration of effect or the offset half-time of
tension recovery (off t1/2). in additional experiments, the trachea
was removed from male guinea pigs (450–650 g, dunkin-hartley;
charles river, portage, mi). the epithelium was removed, and
tracheal strips (2 cartilage rings) were prepared and similarly
evaluated.
airway mechanics. mice were pretreated intranasally (50 ml per
mouse) with vehicle (0.9% saline) or  xxxd3468xxx  at intervals (0.25–48
hours) prior to  xxxd2586xxx  challenge, and placed into individual
plethysmograph chambers (buxco electronics, troy, ny). fresh air
was supplied by bias flow pumps to the chambers. after baseline
respiratory [enhanced pause (penh)] values were collected, the mice
received  xxxd2586xxx  (30 mg/ml or ec80) by aerosol delivery (flow 5
1.6 ml/min  2 minutes; devilbiss model 5500d, utrasonic nebulizer;
devilbiss, somerset, pa). an average penh was then calculated for
5 minutes. penh 5 [(expiratory time / relaxation time) 2 1]  (peak
expiratory flow / peak inspiratory flow), and relaxation time is the
amount of time required for 70% of the tidal volume to expire. in some
cases, animals were treated on multiple, consecutive days as described in the figure legends. the data were expressed as the mean 6
s.e.m. percent inhibition of penh or (mean penh value of vehicle
treated group 2 penh for each drug-treated animal) divided by (mean
penh value of vehicle treated group)  100%. data were analyzed
using commercially available software (graphpad prism 3.0).
in guinea pigs (600–800 g), machr antagonists or vehicle (0.5%
tween; sigma-aldrich) were administered intratracheally by instillation (200 ml) under anesthesia (5% isofluorane). the animals
were reanesthetized (ketamine 90 mg/kg, xylazine 15 mg/kg intramuscular) after 4 hours for cannulation of the jugular vein, carotid
artery, and trachea for drug delivery, blood pressure recording, and
ventilation of the animal (pressure 5 8 cm h2o, 60 breaths/min;
model 683; harvard apparatus, south natick, ma). succinylcholine

binding data were fitted to a one-dissociation model for koff values and
estimates of dissociation half-lives (t1/2). kd values were also calculated
from kon and koff values using the equation kd 5 koff/kon.
potency measurements of  xxxd3468xxx  for receptors or sites other
than machrs were conducted by cerep laboratories (poitiers,
france).
calcium mobilization in cho cells. functional antagonism of
ach-mediated calcium transients via human m1, m2, and m3 achr
was carried out using a microtiter plate-based fluorometric imaging
plate reader (flipr) assay (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca)
(schroeder and neagle, 1996). cho cells were placed in 96-well plates
(40,000 cells/well; packard) for 24 hours, and then the medium was
replaced with eagle’s minimal essential medium containing earl’s
salts, l-glutamine, 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (sigma a-788; sigmaaldrich, st. louis, mo), 4 mm fluo-4-acetoxymethyl ester fluorescent
indicator dye (fluo-4 am; molecular probes, grand island, ny), and
2.5 mm probenecid for 1 hour at 37°c. this medium was replaced with
a similar one minus the dye and 0.1% gelatin instead of albumin. after
10 minutes, the cells were washed (3) with krebs–ringer-henseleit
buffer: nacl (120 mm), kcl (4.6 mm), kh2po4 (1.0 mm), nahco3
(25 mm), cacl2 (1.0 mm), mgcl2 (1.1 mm), glucose (11 mm), hepes
(20 mm), ph 7.4, plus 0.1% gelatin and 2.5 mm probenecid. cellular
responses to ach in the presence or absence of antagonist were
monitored (flipr excitation 5 488 nm, and emission 5 516 nm).
data were acquired every second and analyzed using commercially
available software (prism 5.0, graphpad software). potency and
mode of receptor interaction were determined by classic schild analysis (schild, 1949) using calculations of ec50 (half-maximal calcium
response) or pa2 values, where pa2 5 log (dr-1) –log[b]; dr was the
dose ratio defined as the ratio of equiactive concentration (ec50)
of agonist in the presence or absence of antagonist, and [b] was the
concentration of antagonist.
to evaluate the recovery of the ach-mediated calcium responses in
cho cells containing m3 machrs after exposure to antagonist, the
cells were either treated only with antagonist or exposed to the
compound and then washed (3 in 30-minute intervals) with krebsringer-henseleit to remove the compound. the latter group of cells
was then exposed to ach for determination of the residual inhibitory
response to the agonist-mediated increase in intracellular calcium.
the antagonist exposure period was 30 minutes in all cases, whereas
the duration of clearance was 180 minutes; the exception was for
tiotropium (90 minutes in most experiments and 180 minutes in one
experiment, with similar outcomes).
isolated airway responses. human lungs from organ donors
(five males, two females) were obtained from the national disease
research interchange (philadelphia, pa). the human biologic samples were sourced ethically, and their research use was in accord with
the terms of the informed consents. sections of bronchus were removed from the lung and cleaned of adherent parenchyma. bronchial
strips (paired; 3–4 mm in width) were suspended (resting tension 5
1.5 g) in 10-ml water-jacketed organ baths (37°c) made up of krebshenseleit solution containing nacl (113.0 mm), kcl (4.8 mm), cacl2
(2.5 mm), kh2po4 (1.2 mm),  xxxd2534xxx  (1.2 mm), nahco3 (25.0 mm),
and dextrose (11.0 mm) gassed with 95% o2:5% co2 and connected
to grass ft03c force-displacement transducers (grass instrument
company, quincy, ma). meclofenamic acid (1 mm) was added to
block endogenous cyclooxygenase activity. isometric responses were
recorded using a commercially available data acquisition system
(mp100ws/acknowledge; biopac systems, goleta, ca) interfaced
with a macintosh g4 computer (apple, cupertino, ca). after a 1-hour
equilibration period, pulmonary tissues were contracted with ach
(1 mm) until reaching a sustained response to examine tissue
viability. the average ach-induced increase in tension was 0.84 6
0.09 g (n 5 33). paired tissues were then rinsed at 15-minute intervals
to re-establish baseline tone. tissues were then exposed to machr
antagonists or vehicle for 120 minutes before cumulative addition of carbachol to obtain concentration-response curves (crcs)
(van rossum, 1963; muccitelli et al., 2000). in the absence of antagonist,

results
in vitro receptor binding studies. the binding affinity values (ki) for  xxxd3468xxx  obtained using membranes
prepared from cho cells stably expressing the individual five
recombinant human machrs are displayed in table 1. the
values (in pm and corresponding negative log value pki)
obtained under steady-state conditions using [3h]-n-methylscopolamine as the competing ligand are as follows: m1 5 159
(9.8), m2 5 151 (9.8), m3 5 62 (10.2), m4 5 50 (10.3), and
m5 5 131 (9.9). saturation binding of [3h]-n-methyl-scopolamine
to the  xxxg449xxx  was shifted rightward in the presence of
increasing concentrations of  xxxd3468xxx  without a change in
the maximum number of binding sites (bmax 5 5.75 pmol/ml).
the dissociation constant, kd, increased with each incremental change of  xxxd3468xxx .
additional saturation, association, and dissociation binding
studies were performed using [3h] xxxd3468xxx , and for comparison [3h]tiotropium, to determine receptor binding kinetics
at the m2 and m3 machrs. the values [equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) total number of receptors (bmax) association rate (kon), and dissociation rate (koff)] are also shown
in table 1. the data indicate that association was rapid for
both compounds at each receptor type. [3h] xxxd3468xxx  dissociates from the m3 machr more slowly, about 8-fold, than
from the m2 machr (82 versus 9 minutes, respectively). this
difference in dissociation between receptor subtype was also
found for [3h]tiotropium, although the time to reach 50%
receptor occupancy, t1/2, was longer than that for  xxxd3468xxx .
of note is the finding that [ 3 h] xxxd3468xxx  dissociates
from the m2 machr more readily (about 4-fold) than does
[3h]tiotropium. the affinity values, pkd, for the m3 and m2
machrs in these saturation studies showed marginally wider
separation for [3h] xxxd3468xxx  (10.5 versus 9.8) than for
[3h]tiotropium (10.7 versus 10.3).
evaluation of the selectivity of  xxxd3468xxx  using a standardized panel of receptors and channels suggested that it is
not likely to produce biologic effects unrelated to acetylcholine
or machr activity. affinity values (ki) for those proteins with
the most avid binding are 69 and 220 nm for k and s opiod
receptors, respectively; 330 nm for l-type  xxxg289xxx  channel;
170 nm for site 2 na1 channel; and 780 nm for dopamine
transporter. in human embryonic kidney 293 cells,  xxxd3468xxx

was administered (2.0 mg/kg i.v.) to paralyze the animal. resistance
and dynamic compliance were measured throughout the experiment
(palecek, 1969; diamond and o’donnell, 1977). once the animal was
stable, ach (10–100 mg/kg i.v.) was administered. alternate studies
used whole-body plethysmography (buxco xa; buxco electronics)
for determination of penh as an indicator of airway obstruction
(hamelmann et al., 1997). in these studies, animals were exposed to
an aerosol of ach (3.5 mg/ml, flow 5 0.6 ml/min  36 seconds followed
by a 2-minute drying time; devilbiss pulmosonic 5000d; devilbiss).
data (penh) were collected for 10 minutes following the ach exposure,
and the area under the curve was calculated.

glaxosmithkline policy on the care, welfare and treatment of
laboratory animals, and were reviewed by the institutional animal
care and use committee at glaxosmithkline facilities where the

charles river breeding laboratories) and guinea pigs (dunkinhartley; charles river breeding laboratories) were allowed free
access to food and water.
chemicals. the machr antagonist  xxxd3468xxx  (fig. 2) was

rightward displacement of the ach crc comparable to that
obtained previously, and when followed by extensive washing
for 180 minutes before ach challenge, a residual concentrationdependent rightward shift of the ach-induced crc was still
evident. nonetheless, the amount of rightward shift was
markedly less than that produced in the absence of washing. a
different pattern emerged for both ipratropium and tiotropium.
ipratropium (0.1–1 mm) inhibited the ach-induced calcium flux
in a concentration-dependent manner; however, there was
essentially no inhibition remaining after washing the cells. the
initial exposure of cells to tiotropium (3.3–330 nm) produced
concentration-dependent rightward shifts associated with progressive and marked suppression of the maximal ach response.
in the presence of the high concentration of tiotropium (330
nm), there was only a marginal calcium response stimulated
by ach. a rightward shift of the ach crc remained after
clearance of the antagonist from the cells; however, the three
concentrations of tiotropium resulted in the same magnitude
of rightward movement of the crc (relative to ach alone),
seemingly independent of the drug concentration applied initially to the cells. in addition, there was no loss of the maximal
response after clearance. these data indicate that these three
muscarinic receptor antagonists display independent patterns
of pharmacological activity upon exposure and after clearance
of the compounds.

in vitro functional studies. functional pharmacological activity of  xxxd3468xxx  was evaluated using two in vitro
systems: first, by monitoring calcium flux in cho cells
transfected with the human recombinant machrs (and gcoupled proteins) and stimulated with ach, and second, by
measuring contractile responses in strips of airway isolated
from human bronchus or guinea pig trachea.
in cells containing the human recombinant m3 machr, the
crc obtained with ach was shifted rightward in the presence
of  xxxd3468xxx  (1–1000 nm) in a concentration-dependent
manner (see fig. 3). the maximal ach response was minimally influenced by the presence of the antagonist. potency as
described by the pa2 value was in the pm range for m1–m3
machrs (9.6–10.6; see table 2). schild analysis indicated a
slope of unity consistent with receptor antagonism of the
competitive type for the m3 machr (slope 5 0.96; see fig. 3)
as well as for the m1 and m2 machrs (slope 5 0.83 and 0.93,
respectively; unpublished data).
additional cellular studies showed that the effects of
 xxxd3468xxx  on the m3 machr–mediated activity were slowly
reversible. in fig. 4, it can be seen that pretreatment of cells
with  xxxd3468xxx  (3.3–330 nm for 30 minutes) produced

maximal cch-induced contraction. in this case, the blockade
achieved with 10 nm ipratropium was equivalent to that
produced by 10 nm atropine. tiotropium at the low concentration (0.1 nm) had negligible effects on the cch-crc,
whereas contractile responses to the middle (1 nm) and high
concentrations (10 nm) were similar, both markedly suppressing the maximal cch-induced tension development by more
than 60%.
these latter studies were extended using a modified system
to determine the functional onset of antagonism and the
recovery of tension development by cch upon removal of
 xxxd3468xxx  by continuously superfusing the tissues with cch.
in this manner, the duration of action was estimated by
extrapolation of the half-time to tension recovery (off t1/2)
from a plot of tension developed versus time, and this was
compared with ipratropium and tiotropium (see fig. 6 for data
using 10 nm) and atropine as an additional reference
(unpublished data). the time to 50% of maximal relaxation
(termed on t1/2) for  xxxd3468xxx  was concentration-dependent
and decreased in value as the concentration of antagonist was
increased. at 1 nm, the measured on t1/2 (mean 6 s.e.m.) was
102 6 10 minutes (n 5 3), whereas  xxxd1891xxx  or 100 nm, it
decreased to 43 6 5 (n 5 5) and 20 6 2 (n 5 3) minutes,
respectively. similarly, concentration-dependent on t1/2 values were obtained for ipratropium [19 6 1 (n 5 3), 14 6 3 (n 5
5), and 6 6 0.4 (n 5 3) minutes, respectively] and tiotropium
[24 6 2 (n 5 3), 10 6 1 (n 5 7), and 6 6 0.1 (n 5 3) minutes,
respectively; 10 nm atropine 5 20 minutes, n 5 2, for paired
tissues, historical reference 5 9 6 1 minutes, n 5 17]. when
these tissues were washed free of  xxxd3468xxx , the off t1/2
(with confidence interval range) was also concentrationdependent. at 1 nm, the off t1/2 5 71 minutes (25–170
minutes; n 5 3) and recovery was fully restored, similar to
atropine. however, at the middle and high concentrations,
tension recovery was more prolonged [off t1/2 5 381 minutes
(241 to .600 minutes; n 5 7) and . 600 minutes (n 5 3)], and
only returned  xxxd1891xxx  hours to 67% (an average derived from
those tissues recovering by 50% or more  xxxd1891xxx  hours; some
tissues did not reach this level) and 6%, respectively. by

were similar for 90 minutes of cell washing (c) and for 180 minutes (n = 1; unpublished data). for reference, some cells were treated with antagonists and
ach without washing. studies were conducted independently and are shown here for comparison. the data represent the mean 6 s.e.m. (n = 4).

the pharmacological activity of  xxxd3468xxx  was also determined using the more complex tissue matrix of isolated
preparations of human airway (bronchial strips) in a conventional static tissue bath. in contrast to the studies described
earlier using individual machrs expressed in cho cells, the
human bronchial tissue contains a distribution of muscarinic
receptors, both m2 and m3 machrs, found in the normal
airway (coulson and fryer, 2003), albeit at a given segment of
the bronchial tree. thus, any potential interplay of antagonist
activity at the m2 machr or m3 machr would come to bear
on the contractile event. these data were compared with
those obtained for ipratropium, tiotropium, and atropine by
using paired bronchial strips excised from the same donors
(fig. 5). carbachol (cch), an ach mimetic, produced a cumulative concentration-dependent increase in tension development (referenced to that obtained with 1 mm histamine; the
absolute increase in tension was 1.59 6 0.14 g). the changes
in contractile activity were concentration-dependently blocked
by preincubation (120 minutes) of the tissues with  xxxd3468xxx 
(1–100 nm), thereby displacing the cch-crc to the right in
a parallel manner. the potency value, i.e., pa2 5 9.5, indicated sub-nm affinity with only a modest suppression of
the maximal response to cch. using only a single concentration of atropine (10 nm), a rightward shift of the
cch-crc also occurred, and the magnitude was comparable to that obtained at the lowest concentration (1 nm) of
 xxxd3468xxx . ipratropium (1–100 nm) also shifted the cchcrc to the right (pa2 5 9.2), but was without effect on the

contrast, contractile tension essentially recovered  xxxd1891xxx  hours
at all concentrations of ipratropium [off t1/2 (minutes) 5 6
(4–9; n 5 3), 63 (28–118; n 5 5), and 224 (143–310; n 5 3),
respectively]. tiotropium was slow to recover contractile
tension [off t1/2 (minutes) 5 176 (62 to .600; n 5 3), 434
(331 to .600; n 5 7), and .600, respectively], and had
negligible recovery of tension at 100 nm after 10 hours, about
1% (10 nm atropine offt1/2 5 55 minutes, n 5 2; historical
reference 5 34 minutes, range 5 23–49 minutes, n 5 17).
at the end of the protocol after clearance of cch, histamine
exposure elicited a robust contraction, indicating that the
tissues were viable and responsive to nonmuscarinic mechanisms. when the on t1/2 and off t1/2 values ( xxxd1891xxx  nm) were
measured in guinea pig tracheal strips, the average values

in vivo studies. it is well established that administration of exogenous ach (or mimetics) produces a robust
bronchoconstriction that can be countered by administration of muscarinic antagonists. pharmacodynamic activity of
 xxxd3468xxx  was evaluated in a murine model of  xxxd2586xxx 
(mch)-induced bronchoconstriction using a standard plethysmograph (penh served as a surrogate measure of changes
in airway tone). when administered intranasally as a solution,  xxxd3468xxx  blocked nebulized  xxxd2586xxx  (30 mg/ml
or ed80 value for maximal bronchoconstriction) in a dosedependent manner (ed50 5 0.02 mg per mouse measured
5 hours after instillation). the inhibitory effect following a
single administration was sustained for a prolonged period of
time, e.g., at 0.05 mg per mouse, inhibition was about 50% or
greater for up to 72 hours (data not shown). this inhibition
continued, albeit at lower levels, for nearly 7 days. comparable data were obtained for tiotropium at the same dose,
although the maximal bronchodilatory effect occurred sooner
(5 hours) than that of  xxxd3468xxx  (24 hours post dose). when
 xxxd3468xxx  was given once daily to mice for 5 consecutive
days (0.025 mg intranasally), the level of inhibition on the fifth
day was modestly increased above that obtained after a single
administration to the same mice (60 versus 35%, respectively). after the fifth day of dosing, the mice were rested for
5 additional days, allowing bronchomotor tone to return to
baseline levels. on the sixth day, the mice received one last
dose of antagonist and were once again challenged with mch.
the level of inhibition was essentially the same as that found
on the first day of testing, indicating that tolerance was not
evident with repeated intranasal delivery of  xxxd3468xxx . by
contrast, when  xxxd3468xxx  was given orally (2.0 mg/kg) to
mice at a dose 100 times the ed50 value (intranasal), there
was no observable protection against an mch challenge
(monitored for 24 hours post dose; unpublished data).
in similar studies using guinea pigs rather than mice,
intratracheal instillation of  xxxd3468xxx  (0.25, 2.5, and 25 mg
per guinea pig) dose dependently blocked the increase in penh
elicited by aerosolized ach (fig. 7a). inhibitory effects were

sustained for long periods of time, and the duration of the protection was more protracted with each increase in  xxxd3468xxx .
for example, the level of blockade corresponding to 50%
inhibition was maintained for more than 2 days at 2.5 mg per
guinea pig, and for more than 5 days at 25 mg per guinea
pig. these increments were not, however, dose-proportional.
when the inhibitory effects of  xxxd3468xxx  were compared
with those obtained with tiotropium (animals were given both
compounds at 2.5 mg per guinea pig), the findings were
comparable (fig. 7b). additional studies in which anesthetized guinea pigs were instrumented for measurements of
airway resistance and heart rate showed that  xxxd3468xxx 
(0.025, 0.25, and 2.5 mg) inhibited the ach-induced dosedependent increase in airway tone (fig. 8a). at the highest
dose of ach (100 mg i.v.), significant inhibition, i.e., 74.4%, p ,
0.05, was obtained 4 hours after instillation of 0.25 mg per
guinea pig of  xxxd3468xxx . comparable data were obtained
using tiotropium over the same dose range (fig. 8b). complete blockade resulted when the animals received the high

dose of either agent. in these same animals, a dose-related
decrease in heart rate occurred after each administration of
ach in vehicle and in the three drug-treated groups. instillation of  xxxd3468xxx  was not associated with a consistent
dose-related blockade of the ach-induced decrease in heart
rate (unpublished data). for example, the average decrease in
heart rate in the absence of antagonist was 148 6 8 beats per
minute after administration of 100 mg of ach, and at the high
dose of  xxxd3468xxx  (2.5 mg), heart rate declined by 136 6 14
beats per minute.

discussion
the purpose of the present study was to characterize the
pharmacological activity of a novel inhaled antagonist of the
muscarinic cholinergic receptors:  xxxd3468xxx , or  xxxd3468xxx . the major findings indicate that  xxxd3468xxx  is a
potent, competitive, pan-active machr antagonist with a long
duration of action. pharmacological activity was evaluated

is competitive, although the possibility of insurmountable
characteristics cannot be ruled out.
dissociation of [3h] xxxd3468xxx  from the human recombinant
m3 machr was slow. the time until 50% of [3h] xxxd3468xxx 
remained bound to the receptor was about 82 minutes.
dissociation from the m3 machr occurred more slowly
than from the m2 machr, i.e., half-life was 9 minutes. in
our hands, [3h]tiotropium also dissociated slowly from the
two receptors; however, the half-lives were longer lived,
i.e., 273 versus 39 minutes. both compounds avidly bind to
each receptor with less than a log difference in binding affinities between the two receptors. thus, potency per se was
not the likely basis for differences in receptor dissociation.
consistent with the present findings, casarosa et al. (2009)
reported that tiotropium dissociates more slowly from the m3
machr than the m2 machr; however, the half-lives were
27 and 2.6 hours, respectively. although both studies used
human receptors stably expressed in cho cells, methodological differences may have impacted the actual values (e.g.,
[3h]-n-methyl-scopolamine was used in competition kinetic
studies to derive the values in the latter report rather than
the more classic methods used in the present study). these
authors also noted that residence time at the m3 machr was
longer than that at the m2 machr for other antagonists,
i.e., ipratropium, aclidinium, and glycopyrolate. within this
group of compounds, the half-lives of ipratropium were the
shortest. recently, sykes et al. (2012) suggested that “physiological” assay conditions, in particular the sodium ion
concentration of the incubation medium, can markedly reduce
m3 machr residence times by as much as 10-fold, e.g., the
half-life of tiotropium decreased from 462 minutes in the
absence of sodium to 46 minutes in the presence of sodium.
nonetheless, the trends for m3 versus m2 machr dissociation seem to be a characteristic that is common to this group of
pharmacophores.
insight concerning the mechanism of the antagonistmachr interaction has been provided using ligand-bound
crystal structures of m2 and m3 machrs (haga et al., 2012;
kruse et al., 2012). even though the five machr subtypes are
separated into two major classes in accordance with their
selectivity for g proteins—m1, m3, and m5 are associated
with the gq/11 family and m2 and m4 with the gi/o-type
proteins (see, for example, caulfield and birdsall, 1998)—
they show a high level of sequence homology and overall
structural similarity in both intracellular and extracellular
loops within the proteins (kruse et al., 2012; haga et al.,
2012). conservation of the orthosteric binding pocket also
exists across m subtypes; however, structural divergence
between m2 and m3 machr may lie in the three-dimensional
architecture of the binding sites, and this feature may impact
the different dissociation rates of the assorted antagonists
(kruse et al., 2012). kruse et al. (2012) have suggested that as
tiotropium binds to and dissociates from the m3 machr, it
pauses at an alternate, allosteric site in the extracellular
vestibule. a portion of the extracellular loop (loop 2) nearest
the binding pocket of m2 machr may be more mobile, and
interacts with the thiophene ring of tiotropium, thereby
promoting its egress from the orthosteric binding site to the
extracellular vestibule and overcoming the largest energetic
barrier of the binding and dissociation path. in the absence of
additional crystallographic information for other m2 and m3
machr-antagonist complexes, the molecular mechanism(s)

using assays containing either the human recombinant
machrs or endogenous ones resident in human airway and
animal models. the animal models were not designed to simulate human pulmonary disease; rather, they address certain
features of the disease process, i.e., machr-induced bronchoconstriction (canning and chou, 2008). in all cases,  xxxd3468xxx 
potently blocked agonist-mediated events in a manner consistent with a competitive type of antagonism.
the strong antagonist-receptor interaction of  xxxd3468xxx 
was favorably reflected in radioligand binding studies where
affinity values were in the sub-nm range for the five human
machrs. for example, the pki or pkd values for the m3
machr were 10.2 and 10.5 using [3h]-n-methyl-scopolamine
or [3h] xxxd3468xxx , respectively. the level of functional in
vitro potency was obtained when the receptor system was
coupled with its appropriate g-protein and intracellular
molecular assembly to affect changes in intracellular calcium
signaling measured in cho cells and in isolated strips of
human bronchus. in the former assay system, the potency
described by the pa2 value was also sub-nm (pa2 5 10.6
for m3 machr). the parallel rightward shifts and modest
change in the maximal response (at concentrations up to
10 nm) of the ach-induced increase in intracellular calcium
imparted by the presence of the antagonist indicated competitive antagonism. this was confirmed by schild analysis,
where the slope was essentially unity, e.g., m3 machr 5
0.963. the temporal limits imposed by the flipr technology,
i.e., the duration of the antagonist exposure (30 minutes) with
the receptor was markedly greater than that for the agonist
(peak ach response occurs within 4–5 seconds in the absence
of drug), may not have afforded an opportunity for equilibrium, especially at the higher concentrations of the antagonist. at the higher concentrations of  xxxd3468xxx , there was
partial suppression of the maximal response. the impact of
incubation conditions and duration on pharmacological activity of long-acting muscarinic antagonists, such as tiotropium, has been brought out by previous investigations (disse
et al., 1993; casarosa et al., 2009, 2010). these investigators suggested that the affinity and maximal machrmediated effects of these agents may be underestimated should
the incubation time be abbreviated within the chosen assay
system.
a partial suppression of the maximal carbachol-induced
contractile response, albeit only about 10–25%, also resulted
when  xxxd3468xxx  was exposed to strips of isolated human
bronchus. in this case, suppression was independent of the
amount added to the static tissue bath. nonetheless, potency
was consistent with that obtained in the other in vitro
systems, with a calculated pa2 value of 9.5. by comparison,
the simple competitive muscarinic antagonist atropine was
without effect on the maximal response. ipratropium blocked
tension development in a manner similar to that of atropine,
and was equi-effective  xxxd1891xxx  nm. tiotropium at the lowest
effective concentration used in these studies, i.e., 1 nm,
reduced the maximal response to about 30% of that produced
by carbachol alone, and this pattern deviated little at the
higher concentration (10 nm). the latter effects likely represent an allosteric modulation of the receptor conformation.
these chemically distinct machr antagonists display quite
varied responses, from competitive to noncompetitive, in complex human biologic systems. taken together, the data suggest that the mode of antagonism provided by  xxxd3468xxx 

 xxxd3468xxx : a novel inhaled muscarinic cholinergic antagonist

the protective effects are long lived after a single dose to
animals and comparable to those obtained with tiotropium,
yet  xxxd3468xxx  does not appear to accumulate in the lung
nor create drug-induced tolerance following several days of
consecutive administration. the data underscore the view
that very small amounts of  xxxd3468xxx  are required to maintain a patent airway for gas exchange. these animal models
simulate airway obstructive events but do not equate to the
lung remodeling that takes place over decades in patients with
pulmonary diseases such as copd. nonetheless, if there is
a corollary in human disease for the bronchoprotection found in
these animal models,  xxxd3468xxx  should provide once daily
control of ach-driven enhancement of airway tone in the clinical
setting.
last, activity at the m2 machr represented by a blockade
of the ach-induced decline in heart rate measured in guinea
pigs was not observed within the efficacious dose range used
in the present investigation. it should be noted that diffusion
of the compound from the lung parenchyma to the large
plasma volume occupied by the systemic circulation dilutes
the drug concentration severalfold, thereby diminishing any
potential for m2 machr-mediated cardiac effects. altered
cardiac and pulmonary vagal tone is found in many pathophysiological conditions, including copd. clinical use of
machr antagonists such as tiotropium is currently accepted
as a treatment in this patient population. in a recent clinical
study of patients with copd, treatment with  xxxd3468xxx 
was well tolerated with no apparent treatment-related changes
in vital signs, including pulse rate, while significant improvement in lung function (fev1, forced expiratory volume in one
second) at all doses was obtained (decramer et al., 2013). the
pharmacological findings of the present investigation using
defined agonist-antagonist conditions would appear to have
a corollary to those found in the clinical setting. thus, these
results have therapeutic relevance.  xxxd3468xxx  may serve
as a long-acting competitive antagonist providing bronchodilatory relief to patients with pulmonary diseases such as
copd.

of dissociation remain to be fully understood despite the
recent progress in this area of drug design.
in the present study, slow receptor dissociation by  xxxd3468xxx 
is consistent with the persistent functional blockade observed in other in vitro assay systems. for example, extensive washing of intact cho cells with antagonist-free media
revealed that blockade of the ach-induced increase in
intracellular calcium was evident for both  xxxd3468xxx  and
tiotropium but not for ipratropium. interestingly, any suppression of the maximal response that was observed prior to
washing for either  xxxd3468xxx  or tiotropium was not apparent
during this “refractory” period. moreover, for  xxxd3468xxx , but
not for tiotropium, the level of refractory antagonism was
concentration-dependent, i.e., rightward displacement of the
ach crc. to what extent (or proportion) these ligands remained bound to either the orthosteric or allosteric sites
cannot be determined from the present experiments; however, they clearly indicate that the responses exhibited by
ipratropium,  xxxd3468xxx , and tiotropium during exposure
and clearance are complex and provide a different array of
receptor-ligand interactions.
different recovery patterns by the antagonists were also
borne out in the restoration of the carbachol-induced contraction of the isolated human bronchial strips after removing
the compounds from the superfusion bathing media. in these
studies, the temporal response after clearance of the low
concentration (1 nm) of ipratropium or  xxxd3468xxx  approximated that obtained upon clearance of atropine, in which
case there was full restoration of tension development (for
reference  xxxd1891xxx  nm; unpublished data). at all concentrations
(1–100 nm) of ipratropium, tension development returned
during the washout period. on the other hand, removal of the
middle (10 nm) and particularly the high (100 nm) concentrations of  xxxd3468xxx  and tiotropium continued to suppress
the tissue response to carbachol even after 10 hours of clearance. this prolonged duration of inhibition was also apparent
for the latter two compounds when administered to either
mice or guinea pigs.
engagement of  xxxd3468xxx  with its cognate receptors,
machrs located within the airway, was responsible for its
pharmacological activity in the animal models. muscarinic
receptors populate the airways of a variety of species, including humans, and are present on nerve terminals, airway
smooth muscle, vascular endothelium, and submucosal glands
(coulson and fryer, 2003). although m2 machrs are located
on prejunctional nerve terminals, and both m2 and m3
machrs are located on airway smooth muscle cells, it is the
m3 machr that dominates the action of ach upon release
from parasympathetic nerves. fisher et al. (2004) showed
that, in mice deficient of the m2 machr, vagal stimulation
or  xxxd2586xxx  challenge produced enhanced bronchoconstrictor activity, whereas in those lacking the m3 machr,
bronchoconstriction was abolished.  xxxd3468xxx  treatment
prevented bronchoconstriction in both the murine and guinea
pig models. given the separation of potency, albeit a modest
difference, and the kinetic differences in dissociation between the m2 and m3 machrs, it could be argued that the
bronchoprotection obtained in animal models primarily
resulted from blockade of the m3 machr. the potency value
obtained in the mouse model, i.e., ed50 5 0.02 mg per mouse,
is consistent with the levels of potency obtained in vitro using
recombinant human receptors and samples of human airway.
