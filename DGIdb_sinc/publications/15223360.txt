abstract
the effect of different dose, mode and duration of estradiol administration was examined in the different brain catecholaminergic
areas in ovariectomized (ovx) female rats. we determined changes in mrna levels of  xxxg2276xxx  (th), rate-limiting
enzyme in catecholamine (ca) biosynthesis, and of  xxxg875xxx  (gtpch), rate-limiting enzyme in biosynthesis of
tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), as well as concentration of bh4, which is an essential cofactor for th, tryptophan hydroxylase and nitric
oxide synthase. short-term administration of  xxxd2038xxx  (eb) by five injections of 15 or 40 ag/kg 12 h apart led to increase in
th and gtpch mrna levels in dopaminergic and noradrenergic cell bodies of the ventral tegmental area (vta), substantia nigra
(sn), locus coeruleus (lc) and the nucleus of solitary tract (nts) depending on dose of administration. estrogen-elicited alterations in
bh4 concentrations were mostly correlated with changes in gtpch mrna levels, except in sn. long-term administration of estradiol
by injections (eb: 25 ag/kg, 16 injections 24 h apart; 50 ag/kg, 16 injections 48 h apart) or pellets (0.1 mg 17 h-estradiol, 14 days)
were not very effective in modulating mrna levels for both genes in most locations except the nts. long-term injections of eb
elevated gtpch mrna levels throughout the nts and in microvessels. administration of estradiol by pellets led to decline of th
mrna in rostral-medial and elevation in caudal parts of the nts. thus, estradiol has a complex and differential effect on th and
gtpch gene expression in a tissue specific manner and depends on the mode of administration.

1. introduction
the risk of cardiovascular disease displays gender specific
differences with premenopausal women protected. estrogens
are likely at least partially responsible for this discrepancy
(reviewed in refs. [8,9,15]). estrogen administration to
experimental animals consistently showed neuroprotection,
and improvements in microcirculation and reduction in blood
pressure [3,16,31] indicating its potential benefit in alleviating neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders. in fact,

early studies suggested a reduction of cardiovascular events
in women with hormone replacement therapy. however,
recent double blind studies of the woman’s health initiative
suggesting an increase risk in coronary heart disease and
perhaps dementia, led to cessation of prempro (estrogen/
progesterone) administration. discrepancies in the effects of
estrogen therapy may be the result of methodological differences between study designs or may relate to differences in
the treatment regimens and/or in the subjects [10].
conflicting results may also be due, in part, to the mode of
hormone administration and their interaction with tissue
specific effects of estrogens.
estrogen receptors (era and erh) have been mapped
not only to brain areas directly involved in the regulation

of reproductive functions but also to other regions, including catecholaminergic structures, such as locus coeruleus
(lc), nucleus tractus solitarius (nts), and substantia nigra
(sn), although their density is lower and more diffuse
[28,29]. a number of studies have revealed that estradiol
can modulate catecholamine (ca) biosynthesis as well as
activity and gene expression of its rate-limiting enzyme,
 xxxg2276xxx  (th) [2,18,25,36]. th is regulated in
a complex fashion by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms [48]. changes in levels of its essential
cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), which is also an
essential cofactor for tryptophan hydroxylase and nitric
oxide synthase [1,32,45], are important for regulation of
th activity and stability [44]. bh4 levels are dependent
on activity of  xxxg875xxx  (gtpch), the first
and rate limiting enzyme of its biosynthesis [13,33,44].
th mrna levels in the nts and lc were shown to
be significantly higher in estrogen-treated castrated male
rats compared to the castrated or intact control groups
[25,36]. interestingly, within female rats, tissue specific
differences of catecholamine biosynthesis related gene
expression were observed in response to estradiol.  xxxd2038xxx  injections reduced both basal and forskolinstimulated th activity in hypothalamus [2]. however, our
recent study revealed that a similar protocol elicited a
dose-dependent elevation of th and dbh mrna levels
in lc, and th and gtpch mrna levels in the sn and
ventral tegmental area (vta) of ovariectomized rats
[2,38,41]. in contrast to these findings with injections,
continual estrogen replacement by capsules for 2 weeks
to rhesus monkey did not alter th mrna levels in the
lc [46].
here we utilized several paradigms of estradiol administration to examine whether estradiol can induce tissue
specific alterations in th and gtpch gene expression.

2. experimental procedures
2.1. animals
the new york medical college animal care and use
committee approved all animal experiments. adult female
ovariectomized (ovx) rats (230 – 250 g) were obtained
from taconic farms (germantown, ny) 8 days after the
surgery. food and water were available ad libitum and the
rats were maintained four per cage under controlled
temperature and light conditions. six days later, they were
treated with estradiol or appropriate vehicle. each group
contained eight animals. for short-term administration,

they were given 0, 15 or 40 ag/kg  xxxd2038xxx 
(eb, sigma) in sesame oil (0.5 ml/kg body weight) by
subcutaneous injections in the nape of the neck five
injections, twice daily 12 h apart (9 am and 9 pm).
for long-term injections, rats were administered 25 ag/kg
of eb once daily (9 am) for 16 days or 50 ag/kg eb
every 2 days for 30 days. control animals were treated
with the same volume of oil. for continual long-term
administration of estradiol, pellets with placebo or 17 hestradiol (0.1 mg/pellet, 21-day release) were implanted
subcutaneously in the nape of the neck. three hours after
the last injection (except for 50 ag/kg eb experiment
which were taken 24 h after the last injection) or 14 days
after implantation of pellets, the animals were euthanized
by decapitation between 8 am and noon. blood was
collected in edta containing tubes. plasma 17 h-estradiol
levels (table 1) were determined by radioimmunoassay
using 125i ria kit (icn). the brain was removed and
dissected using a tissue slicer with digital micrometer
(stoeltin). frontal sections 13.2 –14.2 and 14.2 –15 mm
from bregma were taken for rostral-medial and caudal
portions of nts, respectively; from 9.2 to 10.4 mm for
lc and from 4.8 to 5.5 mm for sn and vta. the slices
were placed in ice-cold saline, and the bilateral regions
were punched out from individual animals and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. arterioles from gracilis
muscle were isolated as previously described [16].
2.2. isolation of rna and quantitative analysis of th and
gtpch mrna levels
total rna was isolated as previously described [39].
briefly, the tissue from each animal was homogenized in
rna-stat-60 (tel-test). for northern blot analysis, rna
was then isolated and fractionated on 1.2% agarose gels
and transferred to gene-screen plus membranes (new
england nuclear). hybridizations were subsequently performed according to our previously published procedures
[39] with [32p] labeled rat th cdna, rat gtpch
crna and dna for 18s rrna, as a control. the
single-strand antisense crna probe for gtpch was
transcribed by using t7 rna polymerase and [32p]utp (800ci/mmol) by employing an rna transcription
kit (ambion). hybridization was performed at 42 jc
with th cdna probe and at 64 jc with gtpch
crna probe in ultrahyb solution (ambion). following washing, the blots were exposed to biomax film
(kodak) within the liner range of the signal. autoradiograms were scanned and analyzed by using image-proanalysis software (media cybernetics). the values for

th and gtpch mrna were normalized to levels of
18s rrna.
quantitative analysis of th and gtpch mrna levels
in the nts and gtpch mrna in microvessels was
performed by real-time rt-pcr with sybr green i with
lightcycler (roche molecular biochemicals, indianapolis,
in). rna was isolated as described above and rt reactions
performed separately with th or gtpch specific primers
5v-tcaggctcctctgacag-3v or 5v-aggctgcaaggcttctgtgatggc-3v, respectively.
rt reactions were performed in 5 al pcr mixture (1 
amv buffer, 12.5 am dntp, 8 units rnase, 1.25 units
amv, primer, and 1 ag of template rna); 20 al pcr
reactions was set up with final concentration of 1  lightcycler dna master sybr green i, 0.5 am of each of the
forward and reverse primers, 5 mm mgcl2 and 2 al of the
standard cdna or cdna with unknown concentration. a
standard curve using serial dilutions from 2 ng to 0.2 pg of a
gtpch or th cdna was used for the quantification by fit
points method. the following primers were used: for th: 5vgtgaaccaattccccatg-3v, 5v-agtacaccgtggagag-3v; for gtpch: 5v-ccacgccatgcagttcttcacca-3v, 5v-aggctgcaaggcttctgtgatggc-3v.
the presence of a specific target sequence was confirmed
with melting curve analysis by comparing its melting temperature with those of standards.
2.3. bh4 analysis by hplc
tetrahydrobiopterin was measured as its fully oxidized
form, biopterin, using an hplc (shimadzu, kyoto, japan)
coupled to a fluorescence detector [19]. brain samples were
homogenized by sonication in 250 al of extraction buffer
[20 mm tris– hcl (ph 7.4), 0.1 mm edta, 10% glycerol,
1% tween and 1/1000 volume of 1 m dtt], centrifuged at
16,000  g for 20 min and 100 al of supernatant mixed
with 100 al of 0.2 n hcl. oxidation was performed by the
addition of 10 al acidic  xxxd2375xxx . after 1 h, the
excess of iodine was reduced by adding 10 al of 2%
 xxxd228xxx . samples were filtered through the 4 mm
millex filter unit with 0.45 am filter pore size (millipore,
bedford, ma) and loaded to autosampler and separated in
allsphere ods 1– 5 am column (250 mm long, 4.6 mm i.d.;
alltech, deerfield, il). integration and analysis of the
hplc peaks were performed with ezstart 7.1.1 sp1
software (shimadzu). the concentration of bh4 was calculated based on a calibration curve created by the standards of 6-biopterine (sigma) from 0.5 to 6 pmol included in
the same run as the samples.
2.4. statistical analysis
data are presented as mean f s.e.m. results were
evaluated by student’s t-test or by anova, followed by
fisher’s post hoc comparisons. a value of p v 0.05 was
considered significant.

3. results
3.1. short-term estradiol injections raise th and gtpch
mrna and bh4 levels in several catecholaminergic brain
regions
we evaluated whether short-term estradiol injections can
modulate mrna levels for th and gtpch in dopaminergic cell bodies of the sn and vta as well as in noradrenergic neurons of the lc and the nts in ovx female
rats. two concentrations of eb, 15 or 40 ag/kg body
weight, were injected five times 12 h apart; 3 h after the
last injection rats were euthanized. relative mrna levels
of th and gtpch were determined by northern blot
analysis of rna from sn, vta or lc and by real time
pcr in the nts of rats. both concentrations of eb
significantly elevated mrnas for these enzymes in lc
(fig. 1). gtpch mrna levels were about 50% higher
than control levels with either concentration of eb. induction of th mrna in the lc was more effective with 40
ag/kg eb than with 15 ag/kg, which raised th mrna by
about 300%.
in dopaminergic neurons, the vta was more sensitive to
estrogen since both concentrations of eb elicited a modest,
but significant, rise in th and gtpch mrna levels (fig.
1). however, in the sn, there was no change in th mrna
levels and only the higher dose of eb caused about a twofold induction of gtpch mrna levels.
in the nts, only the higher concentration of eb induced
a significant elevation of th and gtpch mrna levels in
the caudal portion and of th mrna levels in the rostralmedial portion of the nucleus. injections of 15 ag/kg eb
elevated gtpch mrna levels in the rostral-medial, but
not the caudal portion of the nts.
since gtpch was elevated by eb, we examined
whether these changes are reflected in bh4 concentration.
bh4 content was measured after conversion to biopterin,
the fully oxidized form of bh4 [19]. this method is very
sensitive and detects levels as low as 0.1 pmol. the basal
levels among the catecholaminergic cell bodies of ovx
rats are shown in table 2. the concentration of bh4 in the
sn, vta and lc was in the range of 3.2 (lc) to 6.01 (sn)
pmol/ag protein. in the nts, levels of bh4 were much
lower about 1/10 (caudal) or 1/20 (rostral-medial) levels in
the sn.
estradiol administration to the ovx rats altered bh4
levels in catecholaminergic neurons (fig. 2). the changes
in concentration of bh4 in brain regions after 15 ag/kg of
eb injections were in good agreement with the eb induced
changes in gtpch mrna in the vta, lc and nts. bh4
levels were increased by estradiol in the vta, lc and
rostral-medial portion of the nts. in the caudal portion of
the nts, neither bh4 nor gtpch mrna was changed
with 15 ag/kg of eb. in the sn although no changes in
gtpch mrna levels were found in response to eb bh4
concentration was somewhat decreased.

3.2. effects of long-term estradiol administration on th and
gtpch mrna levels
next, we examined the effects of several paradigms of
long-term estradiol treatment. for pulsatile administration
of estradiol, rats were injected with eb 25 ag/kg once
daily for 16 days and tissues were taken 3 h after last
injection or with 50 ag/kg eb once every 2 days for 30
days and tissues were analyzed 24 h later. for continuous
administration of estradiol, 0.1 mg of 17 h-estradiol
containing pellets or placebo pellets were implanted
subcutaneously to ovx female rats for 14 days. the
effects on the lc, sn and vta are shown in table 3. in
contrast to the changes observed above with short-term
treatment, these treatments were mostly ineffective. only
significant changes were observed with 25 ag/kg eb
injections which raised gtpch mrna levels in the
lc and th mrna levels in the sn by about 50%.
the nts however, was responsive to long-term administration of estradiol. injections of 25 ag/kg eb once

daily for 16 days led to about two- to three-fold elevation
of th and gtpch mrna levels in the rostral-medial
nts and 50% increase in gtpch mrna levels in
caudal nts (fig. 3). one day after the last injection of
50 ag/kg eb (every other day), gtpch was greatly
increased in both parts of the nts. administration of 17
h-estradiol containing pellets had a marked and diverse
effect on th and gtpch mrna levels in the nts. it
led to a decline of th and gtpch mrna compared to
control values in rostral-medial nts, while it elevated
them in the caudal nts. a single injection of eb did not
induce any additional changes in th and gtpch mrna
levels in the animals which have received 17 h-estradiol
from pellets for 14 days.
since 50 ag/kg eb (every other day) is reported to be
responsible for preservation of  xxxd2738xxx  synthesis in
skeletal muscles arterioles [16], we further examined
whether this effect is at least partially due to changes
in biosynthesis of bh4, cofactor for no synthase.
gtpch mrna levels in microvessels were found to

4. discussion
this study reveals that estrogen can modulate th and
gtpch gene expression in brain catecholaminergic
regions. the response to estrogen was found to depend
on the dose, mode of administration and the tissue examined. the nts was the most sensitive area since it
responded to all the paradigms of estradiol administration.
the nts is widely accepted as a pivotal brain region
involved in the assimilation and integration of multiple
viscerosensory processes, including cardiovascular control
mechanisms, and also in osmoregulatory functions that
control body fluid homeostasis [14,24]. noradrenergic
neurons (a2 catecholaminergic cell group [7]) are located
throughout the rostral-medial and the most in caudal
(commissuralis) subnuclei of the nts; epinephrine-containing cells (c1 cell group) are generally more rostral than
a2 cells [37]. a2 cells are barosensitive, and thus respond
dynamically to alterations in blood pressure as part of the
homeostatic cardiovascular control process. the aortic
nerve in the rat consists mainly of baroreceptor fibers,
terminates most densely in the rostral and medial portions
of the nts while afferents arising from the carotid body
terminate most densely in the caudal portion. carotid sinus
afferents terminate in both regions (reviewed in ref.
[24,47]). thus, the rostral-medial portion of the nts
exerts more control on the arterial system while the caudal
nts is more selective for cardiac system. both pressor and
depressor challenges result in the production of c-fos
protein, particularly in the more caudal regions of the rat
nts, but also in a rostral proportion of a2 catecholaminergic cells [5].
estradiol induced changes in th and gtpch mrna
levels varied in the rostral-medial and caudal portions of the

5

nts and depended on the mode of administration. our
results also revealed that while the levels of estradiol in
blood of ovx rats were similar on the second day after
injections of 50 ag/kg eb and with implanted estradiol
containing pellets (129 or 112 pg/ml) changes in th and
gtpch mrna levels were different, especially in the nts.
in rats receiving 50 ag/kg eb injections, gtpch mrnas
were elevated in both regions of the nts. moreover, when
estradiol was constantly released from pellets, rostral and
caudal parts of the nts responded differently. in the rostralmedial nts, both th and gtpch mrna levels were
lowered in animals receiving the estradiol pellets. additional
injection of eb to these animals did not produce any
additional effect. in the caudal nts, mrna levels for both
genes were elevated by estradiol pellets. short-term administration of the higher dose of eb (40 ag/kg/12 h) by
injections as well as long-term eb injections (25 ag/kg/day
or 50 ag/kg/2 days) induced relatively similar elevations of
th and gtpch mrnas throughout the nts despite the
significant differences in blood estradiol concentration. we
can speculate that estrogen has differential effects on cardiac
and arterial systems or induce coordinate actions in the
regulation of cardiovascular system depending on duration
and mode of administration.
in the lc, the cell bodies of the major noradrenergic
system in the brain, short-term eb injections triggered a
rise in both th and gtpch mrnas, especially at the
higher dose. the elevation of th mrna levels in lc
with estrogen injections are consistent with the findings
by pau et al. [36] in which after several hours of
estradiol infusion th mrna levels were increased in
the lc of rhesus macaques. parallel regulation of th and
gtpch gene expression has been previously observed in
lc in response to several other treatments including
reserpine administration and immobilization stress
[13,39]. the parallel rise in gtpch and th in response
to estradiol treatment may be important for the activation
of ne system and modulation of neuroendocrine, behavior and autonomic function which involve the lc neurons. however, the long-term estradiol administration by
injections or pellets did not elicit any observed changes

in gene expression and did not alter bh4 levels in the
lc. in this regard, it has been previously reported that
when ovx animals were given estrogen by capsules, th
mrna was not elevated in the lc, although the same
treatment raised galanin mrna in this nucleus [36,46].
in the sn and vta, gtpch mrna was elevated by
estradiol (40 ag/ml) although without parallel changes in

th mrna. similarly, studies with reserpine concluded that
regulation of gtpch and th gene expression is not
coordinated within the sn [13]. the sn is generally less
responsive to several treatments, such as reserpine or
restrain stress, which elevate th gene expression in other
catecholaminergic regions [17,40].
the bh4 concentrations in the sn, vta and lc are
consistent with gtpch mrna levels measured previously
[13]. in the nts, where the density of catecholaminergic
neurons is relatively low, the concentration of bh4 is about
10 times lower than in dopaminergic cell bodies and lc. in
the caudal portion of the nts where noradrenergic neurons
are located, the level of bh4 was found to be twice as high as
in rostral-medial portion. the levels of bh4 in response to
five injections of eb in low doses correlated with changes in
gtpch mrna levels in all regions analyzed except the sn,
where its concentration was somewhat reduced despite no
change in gtpch mrna level. the discrepancy might be
due to the timing of analysis or in transport of bh4 to terminal
regions. in addition, a lack of association between the
abundance of gtpch mrna and bh4 concentration in
basal conditions in nigrostriatal neurons has been previously
reported [13]. differences between populations of catecholaminergic neurons with respect to bh4 biosynthesis rate and
turnover have also been observed [20,21].
it is considered that elevation of th and gtpch mrna
levels shown here leads to increased capacity for catecholamine biosynthesis. the low dose of eb injections was not
effective in the caudal nts but increased the gtpch
mrna levels and bh4 concentration in the rostral-medial
part of nts. since the lower dose of eb did not change th
mrna levels in the rostral-medial part of nts, we specu-

l.i. serova et al. / brain research 1015 (2004) 1–8

late that at this concentration eb may activate biosynthesis
of catecholamines by increasing activity or stability of
preexisting molecules of th [44]. in addition to effect on
biosynthesis of catecholamines in the cns, estradiol can
directly modulate functions of cardiovascular system
through activation of  xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx 
[4,6], which requires bh4 as a cofactor. it is has been
proposed that gender specific differences in endotheliumderived no production may be due to the effect of estrogen
on endothelial function [22]. in perimenopausal women,
estrogen supplementation has been reported to reduce blood
pressure and enhances basal but not acetylcholine-induced
no in forearm resistance arteries [43]. it has also been
shown that 17 h-estradiol treatment increases gtpch
protein, activity and bh4 production in blood vessels
[12]. our results revealed that estradiol induces elevation
of gtpch mrna in arterioles of gracilis muscle in ovx
females suggesting that estradiol can regulate production of
 xxxd2738xxx  through the elevation of bh4 biosynthesis since
elevated level of gtpch mrna was found in microvessels
of estradiol-treated rats.
there are several ways by which estrogen can activate
transcription of the th or gtpch genes. in the classical
pathway, the er binds to specific estrogen response element
(ere) within target genes and recruits a  xxxg1449xxx /p300 complex
to the promoter (reviewed in ref. [4]). this coactivator
complex enhances gene expression by remodeling chromatin and perhaps by contacting the basal transcription machinery. we analyzed the rat th promoter (matinspector
v2.1) and found a perfect half palindromic estrogen responsive motif (ggtca) in position
675. in the gtpch
promoter also three putative half-palindromic eres were
found. their ability to bind ers and potential role in
activation of transcription by e2 remains to be studied.
the ca regions analyzed in this study contain estradiol
receptors (era and erh) although their expression and
ratio varies among the tissues [42]. despite a high percentage of homology between those receptors, they have somewhat different functions [11,23,26,35]. the lc is one of the
areas in the brainstem with the highest levels of ers
[34,42]. the lc and nts were found to express relatively
equal amounts of era and erh. however, in the sn, only
erh is expressed, while in the vta, both ers are
expressed, but erh predominates. future studies will determine how the differential response of the different brain
locations is related to the specific er subtype. however,
even the same receptor subtype can interact with the
transcriptional apparatus in a cell specific manner (reviewed
in ref. [27]) since the ers interact with a large number of
proteins that can either positively or negatively regulate
target gene transcription [27,30].
the results of this study indicate that estrogen can
modulate synthesis of dopamine and noradrenaline in brain
catecholaminergic systems not directly involved in the
reproductive functions. the estrogen triggered alteration of
catecholamine related gene expression can implicate behav-

7

ioral plasticity of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons
controlling movement, mood, reward, stress and blood
pressure. the findings demonstrate the complexity of estradiol triggered regulation of gene expression in catecholaminergic regions and show that the effects of estrogen vary
among the nuclei belonging to different neuronal circuits.
estradiol has a differential effect on th and gtpch gene
expression also depending on the mode of administration.
the findings might help to explain some of the contradictory results obtained in postmenopausal women with estradiol replacement therapy and suggest that greater attention
should be paid to the mode of estrogen administration.
