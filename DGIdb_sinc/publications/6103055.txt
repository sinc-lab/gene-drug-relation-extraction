p- xxxd2844xxx  is over 20 times as potent as (+)-amphetamine as an inhibitor of
5-ht oxidation by  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  in mouse brain in vitro, with a ki value of 0.22 pm.
it is highly selective towards a-type  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  and possesses only weak activity
against the b-type enzyme (ki value about 500 p~ with  xxxd314xxx  as substrate and solubilized rat liver mitochondria as enzyme source). it is 10 times more active than (+)-amphetamine in protecting mouse brain  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  from inhibition by phenelzine in vivo.
o-methoxy- and m-methoxyamphetamines inhibit  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  both in vitro and in
vivo with potencies comparable with, or less than that of (+)-amphetamine.
p- xxxd2844xxx  is the simplest of the
hallucinogenic amphetamine derivatives (shulgin et
a1 1969). it causes neither the marked motor stimulation nor the stereotyped behaviour found with
amphetamine itself, and it affects 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurons much more strongly than
catecholaminergic neurons (tseng et a1 1976). it is
about ten times more active than amphetamine in
elevating brain 5-ht and in lowering 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (hitzemann et a1 1971). insertion of
chloro or methyl substituents into the para position
of amphetamine has been shown to enhance its
 xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitory properties (fuller
1966; ross et a1 1977), hence it seemed possible that
the high potency of p- xxxd2844xxx  in
raising brain 5-ht concentrations could be accounted for if this compound were appreciably more
active than amphetamine as an inhibitor of  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  (mao). in this paper it is shown that
p- xxxd2844xxx  is a highly potent and
selective inhibitor of a-type m a 0 both in vitro and
in vivo whereas the 0-and m-isomers have potencies
comparable with, or slightly less than that of (+)amphetamine.

amine sulphate was obtained from smith, kline &
french laboratories and phenelzine hydrogen
sulphate from fluka ag. [14c]-5-ht creatinine
sulphate and [14c]dopamine hydrochloride were
obtained from the radiochemical centre, amersham. these were diluted with aqueous solutions of
the same unlabelled substrates to give a final concentration of 40 pg base containing 0.225 pci (500 000 d
min--') ml-l.
animals. male cba strain mice (20-30 g) were used
in the in vivo experiments and as a source of brain
homogenate. mice given (+)-amphetamine were kept
singly in individual boxes to minimize central
excitement. sprague-dawley rats (200-300 g) were
used as a source of brain and liver mitochondria.
tissue and enzyme preparations. mice were killed by
cervical dislocation, and their brains were homogenized in 9 volumes of ice-cold 0.1 m sodium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) with an ultra-turrax 18/2
homogenizer. rat brain and liver mitochondria were
obtained by differential centrifugation of brain or
liver homogenized in 0.3 m sucrose (green 1962).
the sedimented mitochondria were suspended in
phosphate buffer to give a final volume of 1 ml g-'
wet weight of tissue. all preparations were stored at
- 15 "c until required. solubilized rat liver mitochondria were obtained by diluting the mitochondria1
suspension with 9 volumes of buffer containing
1.25% tergitol npx (british drug houses). the
suspension was left at room temperature (20 "c) for
10 min and was then centrifuged at 75 00og for
15 min. the clear supernatant, which contained the
solubilized enzyme, was decanted and kept at 0 "c.
the m a 0 activity of this preparation declines
slowly, decreasing by about 30% after 2 days, when
the preparation was discarded.

enzyme assays. m a 0 activity was assayed at low
substrate concentration at 30 "c and ph 7.4 essentially as described by otsuka & kobayashi (1964).
with [14c]-5-ht as substrate (final concentration
11.5 p ~ ) , the non-basic reaction products were
extracted directly into anisole containing 0.6 %
diphenyloxazole (ppo) ready for counting, as in
the original method, but with [14c]dopamine, the
product recovery on extraction with this solvent was
poor. consequently, with dopamine the reaction
products were first extracted into 10ml of ethyl
acetate, 7 ml of which was then added to 1 ml
ethanol and 7ml of anisole containing ppo for
counting. in the kinetic studies at varied 5-ht
concentration, the concentration of labelled substrate was kept constant and the total concentration
altered by adding various concentrations of unlabelled 5-ht immediately before the labelled substrate. the apparent m a 0 activity measured in
terms of counts min-l in the anisole extract was
corrected at each substrate concentration to allow for
the altered initial specific activity.
m a 0 activity of solubilized rat liver mitochondria
with  xxxd314xxx  as substrate was assayed by continuous recording on a pye unicam sp8-100 double
beam spectrophotometer of the increase in extinction
at 250 nm produced at 30 "c and ph 7.4 when
0.1 ml  xxxd314xxx  (normally 10 mm) was added to
0.2 ml enzyme preparation and 2.9 ml 0.1 m sodium
phosphate buffer containing the inhibitor (gorkin et
a1 1963).
in vivo experiments. pairs of male mice were given
(+)-amphetamine sulphate, one of the  xxxd2844xxx  hydrochlorides, or 0.9 % nacl 15 min
before phenelzine hydrogen sulphate. the drugs
were dissolved in 0.9% nacl and injected subcutaneously in a volume of 10 ml kg-l; the phenelzine was also neutralized with sodium bicarbonate.
all doses are expressed in terms of the drug salt.
after 24 h, the mice were killed and the brains were
removed and homogenized in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) for m a 0 assay by the radioisotopic method with 5-ht as substrate as described
above. the assay mixtures contained 5 mg brain
tissue in a total volume of 2 ml.

the oxidation of 5-ht by m a 0 in mouse brain
homogenate was inhibited competitively by p  xxxd2844xxx . the level of inhibition was
independent of how long the inhibitor was incubated

presence of two enzyme forms acting o n this substrate, one being very sensitive to inhibition by p  xxxd2844xxx , and the other being very
insensitive.
the low potency of all four compounds as inhibitors of the b form of m a 0 was confirmed by use of
 xxxd314xxx  as substrate with solubilized rat liver
mitochondria as the source of enzyme. (+)-amphetamine itself has already been shown to be a weak
reversible competitive inhibitor in this system
(mantle et al 1976). these authors also showed that
the inhibitory potency of amphetamine and other
phenylalkylamines with  xxxd314xxx  as substrate
and membrane bound m a 0 as enzyme source was
similar to that found using solubilized mao. the

concentration of  xxxd314xxx  used (312 p ~ is

inhibitory potency against m a 0 in vivo was
determined from the ability of these compounds to
diminish the long lasting inhibition of 5-ht oxidation by mouse brain m a 0 produced by injection of
phenelzine (green & el hait 1978). plots showing the

from experiments on the inhibition of rat brain
m a 0 in vitro by the irreversible inhibitor  xxxd1730xxx ,
johnston ( i 968) suggested that this tissue contained
two major forms of mao, the a-form which was
highly sensitive to  xxxd1730xxx  and for which 5-ht was
a specific substrate, and the b-form which was much
less sensitive to  xxxd1730xxx  and for which  xxxd314xxx 
was a specific substrate. dopamine and tyramine are
oxidized by both forms. although the molecular
differences underlying this classification are still
unclear and although difficulties sometimes arise in
applying it to all tissues (fowler et al 1978), it
nevertheless still provides a useful pragmatic basis
for interpreting the complex kinetic behaviour
observed when inhibition is studied with a range of
different substrates. a number of competitive
reversible inhibitors, including harmaline (fuller
1968) and amphetamine (mantle et all976) have also
been shown to possess moderate selectivity for the
a-form of mao. p- xxxd2844xxx , which is
over 1000 times more active in blocking 5-ht
oxidation than  xxxd314xxx  oxidation, must now be
included in this group. the selectivity of this compound for the a-form is confirmed by the plot of the
reciprocal of the residual enzyme activity against
inhibitor concentration obtained with dopamine as
substrate. his shows a clear division into two
sections, one corresponding to a form very sensitive

266

to inhibition by p- xxxd2844xxx , the other
corresponding to a form which is relatively insensitive
to this inhibitor.
selectivity for the a-form of m a 0 is also shown
by 0- and rn-methoxyamphetamines, as well as by
amphetamine itself, but the selectivity is less pronounced than with thep-isomer. the four compounds
show rather similar potencies with  xxxd314xxx  as
substrate, but p- xxxd2844xxx  is over 20
times as active as the other three compounds with

pharmacological effects in animals are normally
around 1 mg kg-i upwards (krishna menon et al
1976). the hallucinogenic dose in man is of the same
order (shulgin et al 1969). these doses would be
sufficient to produce extensive inhibition of m a 0 in
the brain, thus the presence of m a 0 inhibition
should be considered in any interpretation of the
effects of p- xxxd2844xxx  on 5-ht-ergic
nerve function.

5-ht.
the high intrinsic potency of p- xxxd2844xxx  against 5-ht oxidation is also shown in vivo,
where it is around 10 times more active than any of

the other compounds in protecting mouse brain
m a 0 against inhibition by phenelzine. there is a n
excellent correlation for the four compounds
between m a 0 inhibitory potency in vitro, and
ability to protect against phenelzine in vivo. if it
can be assumed that the dose of reversible inhibitor
required t o double the dose of phenelzine needed t o
produce 50% inhibition in vivo is also the dose
itself producing 50% inhibition (this hypothesis will
be discussed further in another paper), then the  xxxd1289xxx 
for inhibition of mouse brain m a 0 by p- xxxd2844xxx  in vivo is about 0.5 mg kg-l. this
dose is only about one quarter of the  xxxd1289xxx  for phenelzine, but whereas inhibition by phenelzine persists for
several days, the high level of inhibition by pmethoxyamphetamine is maintained only for a short
time and the extent of inhibition declines rapidly
after 1 h.
the relevance of m a 0 inhibition for the pharmacology of p- xxxd2844xxx  has not been
investigated directly, but the doses required t o elicit
