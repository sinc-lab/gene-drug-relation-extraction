amylin is a peptide hormone which is co-secreted with insulin from the pancreatic beta-cell. type 1 diabetic individuals and some type 2 diabetic individuals are characterised by amylin deficiency. animal experiments have
revealed several actions of amylin on intermediary metabolism, of these
some have been demonstrated to be of potential physiological relevance in
humans. in particular amylin appears to have important actions in controlling
prandial glucose homeostasis. the peptide hormone inhibits postprandial
glucagon secretion and delays gastric emptying thereby modifying postprandial hyperglycaemia in diabetic individuals which presumably adds to overall
glycaemic control without a concomitant increase in the number of severe
hypoglycaemic episodes. moreover, amylin acts as a satiety agent. amylin
replacement may therefore improve glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus.
however, human amylin exhibits physicochemical properties predisposing the
peptide hormone to aggregate and form amyloid fibres, which makes it
unsuitable for pharmacological use. a stable analogue,  xxxd2994xxx , with
actions and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties similar to the
native peptide has therefore been developed. the efficacy and safety of
 xxxd2994xxx  administration to diabetic individuals have been tested in a large
number of clinical trials. it is the aim of this review to describe possible
(patho)physiological actions of amylin as demonstrated in animal and human
models, to discuss the background for potential amylin (analogue) replacement in diabetes mellitus and to review results from clinical trials with the
amylin receptor analogue  xxxd2994xxx .

introduction

amylin is a 37 amino acid peptide hormone which is co-stored and co-secreted
with insulin from the pancreatic beta-cell [1] sharing the same processing enzymes.
amylin (also known as islet amyloid polypeptide or iapp) is the product of a distinct gene locus on chromosome 12 [2]. the peptide hormone has a signal transduction pathway similar to calcitonin (ct), calcitonin-gene-related peptide
(cgrp) and  xxxg80xxx  [3] and the specificity of the amylin receptor has
recently been characterised [3,4].
the possible role of amylin in human physiology is still not fully understood
but several studies in animals and humans demonstrate that amylin is capable of
influencing metabolism and, appears to modify postprandial glucose homeostasis.

amylin receptor agonists in the management of insulin-treated diabetes mellitus

it has been suggested that diabetes mellitus often represents
a state of bi-hormonal beta-cell deficiency. type 1 diabetic
individuals are characterised by amylin deficiency [5] whereas
type 2 diabetes may be associated with increased, normal or
decreased amylin levels [6]. deposits of amylin as amyloid are
frequently found in the pancreas of type 2 diabetic individuals and could represent a visible pathological feature which
disrupts islet structure and contributes to the islet dysfunction. discussion of the latter is outside the scope of this
review and the reader is referred to one of several reviews
(e.g., [7]).
human amylin has chemical properties predisposing the
peptide to spontaneous formation of amyloid fibres in aqueous solutions [8], meaning that the native peptide is not suitable for potential pharmacological use. the ability to form
amyloid fibres has been demonstrated to relate primarily to
the sequence at the 25 - 29 amino acid position of the peptide
[9] but other domains within the amylin molecule may also be
involved [10]. an analogue has been developed, substituting
three proline residues at position 25, 28 and 29. this analogue,  xxxd2994xxx , has been demonstrated to display actions
and pharmacokinetic- and dynamic properties similar to
human amylin [11].
since the characterisation of amylin in 1987 [12,13] an abundant amount of evidence from animal and human studies
have documented several physiological as well as pharmacological actions of this peptide. these actions will be discussed
below. however, it is the principal aim of this review to focus
on actions of the amylin receptor agonist,  xxxd2994xxx  and
draw attention to the background for a possible therapeutic
role of the latter in diabetes mellitus.

amylin physiology

amylin is secreted in response to nutrient stimuli [14] and displays a 24 h profile similar to that of insulin [15]. in addition,
amylin has recently been shown to be secreted in a high frequency pulsatile manner [16]. the peptide hormone circulates
in a non-glycosylated and a glycosylated form [17], of which
the former is the biological active compound. approximately
half is non-glycosylated. in healthy humans fasting plasma
amylin concentrations are in the range of 4 - 8 pmol/l and
between 15 - 25 pmol/l in the postprandial state. amylin distributes equally to insulin in plasma and interstitial fluids.
however, in contrast to insulin, amylin is not significantly
eliminated in the liver [18] but mainly through a renal metabolism [19] with a significantly slower clearance rate. experimental studies have shown that amylin appear to function mainly
as a neuroendocrine hormone that exerts its major effects via a
central pathway that includes high affinity binding sites in the
area postrema and other central nuclei with output through
the efferent pathways of the vagus nerve [20-23]. however,
there is also evidence to suggest that amylin may act locally in
the pancreatic beta-cell [24] with a possible paracrine effect to
inhibit its own secretion and that of insulin.
1642

2.1 the amylin

receptor
using binding studies, high-affinity binding sites for amylin
have been demonstrated in brain, kidney and skeletal muscle
in various animal models which is consistent with a functional
target [25]. furthermore, receptors for amylin were identified
in mouse insulin-secreting cell lines [24]. in spite of major
efforts, it has not been possible until recently to elucidate the
molecular basis for specific amylin receptors, although early
finding suggested that amylin performs its biological effect
through interaction with the cgrp receptor [26].
however, recent studies including transfection studies in
different expression systems [4,27,28] have revealed a functional
amylin receptor derived from interactions between the human
 xxxg321xxx  isotype 2 (hctr2) and receptor-activitymodifying protein 1 ( xxxg1926xxx ) and/or  xxxg1928xxx  where
ramps is a family of single-transmembrane-domain proteins
recently discovered. the ramps are believed to function by
transporting seven-transmembrane proteins to the cell surface
and thereby converting them to active receptors [4]. furthermore, rt-pcr demonstrated co-expression of genes encoding
the  xxxg321xxx  and  xxxg1926xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  in insulinsecreting cell lines thereby providing the molecular background for the presence of the amylin receptor [24]. there is
thus increasing evidence that interactions between the  xxxg321xxx , the cgrp receptor and the ramps form the
molecular background for all receptors included in the ct/
cgrp/amylin/ xxxg80xxx  family. this molecular characterisation permits amylin and amylinomimetic agents to be
addressed as amylin receptor agonists.
2.2 amylin

actions in animal experiments
glucose metabolism. several in vitro and in vivo studies,
mainly performed in rodents, have demonstrated significant
effects of amylin on glucose metabolism (for review, see [29]).
in the rat skeletal muscle amylin leads to insulin resistance [30]
by dose-dependently impairing glycogen synthase [31] and
increasing glycogen phosphorylase, [32] thus inhibiting glycogen synthesis and increasing glycogen breakdown and its subsequent glycolysis, the latter resulting in an increased lactate
output [33]. the peripherally derived lactate has been hypothesised to serve as fuel for an increased hepatic gluconeogenesis
with the aim of restoring hepatic glycogen depots. in accordance with this hypothesis it was demonstrated, in contrast to
insulin replacement alone, that the presence of amylin was
required for normalisation of liver glycogen content in  xxxd3249xxx  (stz) diabetic rats, characterised by depleted liver
glycogen stores [34]. amylin does not seem to have any direct
effects on hepatic glucose production [35].
a number of in vivo studies in rodents and dogs have
examined the effects of acute high dose amylin administration on insulin sensitivity employing the hyperinsulinaemic
euglyceamic clamp technique [36-38]. in accordance with the
in vitro studies, most in vivo studies have reported that pharmacological doses of amylin induce insulin resistance in
skeletal muscle.

insulin and glucagon secretion. data on the actions of amylin

on insulin secretion are not clear. some suggest that amylin
inhibits insulin secretion [39,40] but this finding is not generally accepted [41]. however, a selective amylin antagonist in
rats has been found to augment insulin secretion from isolated
pancreatic beta-cells [42] as well as in vivo during an argentine
challenge [43]. moreover, the occurrence of peripheral amylin
binding sites in pancreatic beta-cells could indicate a direct
effect on the insulin secreting cells [24].
amylin inhibits glucagon secretion in rats following an
arginine infusion in a dose-dependent manner [44]. the
amylin-induced inhibition of glucagon secretion was demonstrated at dose levels within those observed in the fed state
suggesting that this amylin action may be of physiological
significance. the glucagonostatic effect of amylin in rats is six
times more potent than glp-1 [45]. however, amylin exhibited no glucagonostatic effects on the isolated perfused
pancreas [46] implying that the ability of amylin to inhibit
glucagon secretion depends on extrapancreatic pathways,
therefore possibly arguing against a direct effect of amylin on
the pancreatic alpha-cell.
gastric emptying. amylin delays gastric emptying [47] and
thus operates as a modifier of the rate at which glucose enters
circulation. dose-response studies have demonstrated that
amylin is several times more potent in slowing gastric emptying than other gastrointestinal hormones like glp-1, secretin,
 xxxg977xxx  and cholecystokinin [48]. moreover,
in rats, lack of amylin accelerates gastric emptying [49] supporting the theory that this action of amylin represents a
physiological effect of the hormone. this effect of amylin
appears to be mediated through the cns and depends upon
an intact vagus nerve [23]. the ability of amylin to slow gastric
emptying has, however, been shown to be overridden by
hypoglycaemia [50].
inhibition of gastric acid and exocrine pancreas secretion. preliminary data indicates that physiological concentrations of
amylin appear to inhibit both  xxxd2873xxx -stimulated gastric
acid secretion [51] and the cholecystokinin-stimulated secretion of lipase and amylase from the exocrine pancreas [52].
these actions of amylin could theoretically complement the
delayed gastric emptying in modifying appearance rates of
carbohydrates from the gastrointestinal tract.
appetite and weight. in a dose-dependent manner, amylin
reduces food intake and body weight in rodents [53-55]. the
inhibitory effect on food intake is present both after intracerebrovascular and peripheral administration of amylin [54]. the
effect of the peptide hormone on reducing food intake
appears mainly to be mediated via central pathways that
includes the aforementioned high affinity binding sites in the
area postrema in the hindbrain [20-23]. unlike the effect of
amylin on gastric emptying, the anorectic effect of the peptide
hormone remains unaltered after vagotomy [55]. this latter
finding is most likely attributed to an ablation of vagal effer-

ents, as both effects of amylin appear to be centrally mediated.
a role for endogenous amylin as a modifier of food intake is
further supported by the finding of increased weight gain in
amylin gene-knockout mice [56].
2.3 amylin actions

in humans
three studies [57-59] have examined the possible impact of
acute administration of native amylin on in vivo glucose
metabolism in healthy humans. despite using highly pharmacological doses of the peptide hormone resulting in circulating
amylin levels 50 - 100 times above normal postprandial concentrations, no effect of native amylin could be demonstrated
on glucose uptake neither as assessed by a hyperinsulinaemic
euglycaemic clamp [59] nor during an iv. glucose tolerance test
[57,58]. however, during the latter a blunted insulin response
was found at the highest dosing level [58]. interpretation of
data should be done with caution. firstly, as previously discussed, native amylin has properties predisposing the native
peptide hormone to aggregate and precipitate which will
influence both bioactivity and radioimmunoactivity. secondly, the commercial amylin preparations may have varying
bioactivity. interestingly, the results from an in vitro experiment using incubated human muscle strips failed to demonstrate any influence of amylin in a picomolar range on
insulin-stimulated glucose transport [60] thus supporting the
lack of physiological amylin concentrations to directly influence skeletal muscle glucose metabolism in man.

native amylin versus the amylin receptor
analogue  xxxd2994xxx 
3.

as outlined above native human amylin has physiochemical
properties [8] which make it unsuitable for potential pharmacological use. the ability to form amyloid fibres and thus
amyloid plaques is primarily related to the sequence at the 25 29 amino acid position of the peptide hormone [9] which differ
between species. moreover recent data have suggested that the
amyloidogenic properties of amylin are also influenced by
other domains within the amylin molecule [10]. whereas
human amylin readily form islet amyloid, this ability is not
seen in rodents [8]. preparing the native human molecule for
pharmacological use led to the development of an analogue, in
which three proline residues were substituted at position 25,
28 and 29 [61]. this analogue,  xxxd2994xxx , is stable, soluble,
non-aggregating and non-adhesive but has been demonstrated
to display actions similar to those of the native peptide
hormone [11].  xxxd2994xxx  has been tested in several clinical
studies which aimed to restore amylin deficiency in diabetes
mellitus in order to asses safety and efficacy of the analogue in
terms of improved glycaemic control (vide infra). like insulin,
 xxxd2994xxx  needs to be administered subcutaneously. since
 xxxd2994xxx  precipitates above ph 5.5, it is currently not
suitable for co-formulation with insulin.

potential rationale for amylin replacement
in diabetes mellitus

add to the potential therapeutic interest in controlling
hyperglycaemia in diabetes mellitus.

destruction and dysfunction of the pancreatic beta-cell,
resulting in absolute and/or relative insulin deficiency represent key abnormalities in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes
[62,63]. assuming that physiological amylin concentrations
influence glucose metabolism, diabetes mellitus could thus be
considered as a condition of bi-hormonal beta-cell deficiency.
as outlined above amylin actions on glucose metabolism
have, however, primarily been characterised in animal experiments. hypothesising that at least some effects of amylin
could be extrapolated to humans, the possible impact on glucose homeostasis in diabetes mellitus needs to be further
addressed. recent understanding of amylin physiology in man
has revealed that the peptide hormone appears mainly to exert
its effects in the postprandial state by inhibiting glucagon
secretion and delaying gastric emptying thereby adding to the
control of postprandial hyperglycaemia. the importance of
postprandial blood glucose control as a specific target of therapy influencing overall glycaemic control and perhaps longterm complications in diabetes mellitus is currently being
extensively debated [64].

4.2 gastric

4.1 hyperglucagonaemia and diabetes mellitus
individuals with diabetes mellitus are often characterised by
elevated circulating glucagon levels [65], especially in the
postprandial state [66,67]. moreover, it should be noted that
even normal glucagon concentrations may be considered
excessive in view of the prevailing hyperglycaemia being an
inhibitor of glucagon secretion. this glucagon hypersecretion is assumed to add to the glucose intolerance in insulin
deficient subjects [67,68] by stimulation of endogenous glucose output. thus, a reduction of prandial glucagon might

1644

emptying and diabetes mellitus
whereas gastric emptying is clearly accelerated in some rodent
models of diabetes [49] studies of gastric emptying in patients
with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are inconclusive and often
confounded by lack of control for prevailing hyperglycaemia
[69] and hyperinsulinaemia [70] which per se retards gastric
emptying. in contrast, amylin deficiency will accelerate gastric
emptying [49]. in this context it is important to note that
much of the confusion in literature is derived from the fact
that diabetic neuropathy can have opposing effects on gastric
emptying to derangements in circulating glucose, insulin and
amylin levels. on average gastric emptying tends to be accelerated in the early stages of type 1 and type 2 diabetes [71,72]
though with a large degree of inter-individual variability. it
has previously been demonstrated that 30 - 50% of individuals with longstanding diabetes show evidence of retarded gastric emptying [69], though this number may be much lower
when examined using appropriate standardised techniques
[73]. the rate of gastric emptying is of course an important
regulator of the rate of appearance of glucose and other nutrients in circulation following meal. consequently, the concept
of increasing gut transit time and thereby postponing glucose
appearance in circulation is already well established in diabetes treatment including both diet treatment such as high fibre
diet and pharmacological agents such as the alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors.

whereas  xxxd2994xxx  failed to influence postprandial glucose
excursions in type 2 diabetic patients treated solely with diet
or oral hypoglycaemic agents, possibly attributed to lack of
amylin deficiency in these groups. the effect of acute  xxxd2994xxx  administration on delaying gastric emptying in type 1
diabetic patients has recently been confirmed using a sophisticated design [77].
possible effects of acute  xxxd2994xxx  administration on skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity in type 1 diabetic
patients have been examined in a placebo-controlled study
employing a two-step euglycaemic clamp followed by a hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp [78]. however, in line with
similar observations in healthy individuals using native amylin [59], the study failed to demonstrate any acute effects of the
analogue on whole-body and forearm insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, as well as hepatic glucose production (figure 2).
taken together these findings contradict the early hypothesis
that amylin receptor agonists induce insulin resistance in
humans. during the hypoglycaemic period mentioned above
[78] recovery from hypoglycaemia and the plasma glucagon
response to hypoglycaemia were not affected by  xxxd2994xxx .

a reduction in serum fructosamine and/or hba1c but some
studies have also focussed on potential (patho)physiological
actions of amylin receptor analogues. the development and
acceptance of  xxxd2994xxx  as a novel pharmacological
approach in the management of diabetes mellitus has not
been without hindrance [74]. however, the amylin agonist is
currently being discussed by the us food and drug administration (fda) and the european agency for the evaluation of
medical products (emea) as an adjunctive therapy for type 1
and type 2 diabetic individuals treated with insulin.
5.1 acute studies
the first  xxxd2994xxx  study in type 1 diabetic patients
involved a  xxxd2994xxx  infusion during a sustacal® meal and
an iv. glucose challenge [75]. this study convincingly demonstrated that the analogue was capable of reducing the glyceamic response to a sustacal® challenge but did not influence
the glycaemic response during iv. glucose administration
(figure 1). although the study did not measure gi motility,
these data supported that delayed gastric emptying could be
one important action of  xxxd2994xxx . similar data were later
reported in insulin treated type 2 diabetic patients [76]

analogously to acute  xxxd2994xxx  exposure, two weeks administration of  xxxd2994xxx  thrice daily to type 1 diabetic subjects
was able to blunt the glycaemic response to a sustacal® meal in
a dose-dependent manner [79]. as regards overall glycaemic
control it was subsequently demonstrated that 28 days of
 xxxd2994xxx  administration as an adjunct to insulin in type 1
diabetes significantly reduced 24 h plasma glucose [80] and
serum fructosamine [81,82]. the improved glycaemic control
during  xxxd2994xxx  treatment was not associated with an
increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes. modest gastrointestinal discomfort was the most frequent side effect. significant reduction in postprandial glucose excursions [78] and
serum fructosamine concentrations [83] following  xxxd2994xxx 
treatment have also been demonstrated in insulin treated
type 2 diabetic individuals.
rodent experiments have demonstated that co-administration of insulin and amylin is necessary to fully replace liver
glycogen stores [34]. a high liver glycogen content could serve
as protection against severe episodes of hypoglycaemia. a
recent study examining hepatic glucose production during a
glucagon challenge in type 1 diabetic individuals following
28 days of  xxxd2994xxx  administration [84] was unable to
detect any differences between  xxxd2994xxx  and placebo.
however, it should be noted that the study design did not
allow any conclusions with respect to liver glycogen content.
further studies have sought to address the effect of
four weeks of  xxxd2994xxx  administration on overall and
postprandial glycaemic control and in particular postprandial
glucagon secretion in patients with type 1 diabetes [82,85].
results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, study [82]
demonstrated that 28 days of  xxxd2994xxx  administration in a
dose of 30 µg t.i.d. to type 1 diabetic individuals significantly

reduced serum fructosamine. following each treatment
period, circulating concentrations of plasma glucose, serum
insulin and plasma glucagon were examined during daytime
(figure 3). despite similar circulating concentrations of insulin
following  xxxd2994xxx  and placebo, postprandial glucose
excursions were markedly reduced after  xxxd2994xxx .
moreover,  xxxd2994xxx  treatment led to reduced concentrations of glucagon (~ 25%) after a carbohydrate rich
breakfast meal (figure 3). reductions in postprandial glucagon
secretion were confirmed in another study [85] where
 xxxd2994xxx  in doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg t.i.d. was able to
dose-dependently reduce plasma glucagon. this glucagono1646

static property of  xxxd2994xxx  has been indirectly supported
by the finding of an enhanced glucagon secretion in diabetic
individuals following administration of a selective amylin
antagonist [86].
it is not clear how amylin agonists modulate postprandial
glucagon secretion, in particular whether there is a direct
effect on the pancreatic alpha-cell [46]. improved glycaemic
control [67] and delayed gastric emptying, the latter leading to
a more sluggish exposure of the protein nutrients capable of
stimulating glucagon secretion probably both contribute. it
may, however, also be mediated through changes in other substrates, hormones and peptides currently not well defined,
glp-1 does not appear to be involved [87]. from a clinical
point of view it is also important to consider whether the relative modest suppression in postprandial glucagon levels
observed in diabetic individuals during  xxxd2994xxx  treatment
[82,85,88] is of significance for glycaemic control. in this regard
there are several issues which need to be considered. firstly,
circulating concentrations of glucagon are considerably
increased in the portal vein compared to those measured in
peripheral plasma. secondly, though the  xxxd2994xxx  induced
suppression of circulating postprandial glucagon levels may
seem modest, they are quite remarkable when evaluated as a
percentage. thirdly, glucagon dynamics are more important
than absolute glucagon concentrations [89]. finally it has been
shown that even small changes in the postprandial glucagon
concentrations within the physiological range affect endogenous glucose release and aggravate postprandial hyperglycaemia in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic individuals [90,91].
5.3 long-term studies

results from six long-term randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled multicentre trials using  xxxd2994xxx  in
addition to insulin therapy in diabetic individuals have been
reported (table 1) [92-97]. three were conducted in type 1 and
three in type 2 diabetic individuals. furthermore one study in
type 1 diabetic individuals [92] was extended over a two-year
period as an open labelled study following the first year [98].
in 1998 the results from two 52-week randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre trials including ~ 1000 diabetic
individuals were reported [92,93]. in the type 1 diabetes study
[92] 477 subjects received either  xxxd2994xxx  or placebo.
hba1c was evaluated following 13, 26 and 52 weeks of treatment and a significant reduction in hba1c was observed in
individuals receiving  xxxd2994xxx  at all time points (figure 4).
in addition significantly more  xxxd2994xxx -treated individuals
reached the ada target of hba1c < 8% after 26 and
52 weeks (figure 5). of note, the improved glycaemic control
during  xxxd2994xxx  treatment was achieved without an
increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes. moreover,  xxxd2994xxx  treatment resulted in a concomitant improvement in
the lipid profile in terms of a decreased ldl/hdl ratio.
obese type 1 diabetic individuals (bmi > 27 kg/m2) experienced a significant weight loss of 1.3 kg during  xxxd2994xxx 
administration.

current insulin regimen. *indicates statistically significant
differences compared with placebo. data are adapted from [92].

similarly 539 obese insulin-treated type 2 diabetic individuals were randomised to either different doses of  xxxd2994xxx  or placebo [93]. at the highest dosing levels (75 and
150 µg twice a day) improvements in hba1c were moderate
after 13, 26 and 52 weeks of treatment (between -0.46%
and -0.93% change from baseline hba1c). furthermore,
 xxxd2994xxx -treated individuals required fewer upward insulin adjustments compared to those receiving placebo. differences in hba1c between  xxxd2994xxx - and placebo-treated
individuals were at all time points amplified in those subjects in whom insulin doses were not increased over time.
importantly,  xxxd2994xxx  treatment at the above mentioned
doses was associated with reduction in body weight (on average -1.6 kg and -2.7 kg, respectively). the most frequently
reported side effect was mild nausea which tended to be
dose-related and subside over time.
similar results have later been reported from two 26 weeksand another two 52 weeks studies, where  xxxd2994xxx  at different dosing levels was administered in type 1 and insulintreated type 2 diabetic individuals [94-97]. type 1 (n = 586)
diabetic individuals received either different doses of  xxxd2994xxx  or placebo for a period of 26 weeks [94]. on average
 xxxd2994xxx  treatment resulted in a significant reduction in
hba1c (between - 0.4% and - 0.6%). however, a subset of all
subjects (those observing a reduction in hba1c of > 0.5% following 4 weeks of treatment) achieved greater reduction in
hba1c throughout the trial. more  xxxd2994xxx  treated individuals (~ 45%) were included in this subset compared with
placebo (~ 25%). in addition to the previously reported

results [92] all  xxxd2994xxx  treated groups experienced a significant weight loss (on average between - 0.7 kg and -1.6 kg)
compared with a slight weight gain in the placebo group.
the 26-week type 2 diabetic study included 499 subjects
[95]. individuals were treated with either  xxxd2994xxx  at different doses or placebo. mean reduction in hba1c were ~ 0.7%
in the  xxxd2994xxx  groups. in accordance with results from the
type 1 diabetic study a subset of individuals were identified
who continued to achieve greater reduction in hba1c
throughout the trial [94]. in all  xxxd2994xxx  dosing groups
there was a significant weight loss (between 0.8 kg and
1.4 kg). side effects were as described [92,93].
results from the two 52-week type 1 and type 2 diabetic
studies [96,97] were reported at ada 2000. type 1 diabetic
individuals (n= 479) were treated with either  xxxd2994xxx  at
two different doses or placebo [96].  xxxd2994xxx  treated individuals experienced a significant reduction in average
hba1c of approximately 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively
compared to an increase in hba1c in placebo treated individuals. similarly  xxxd2994xxx  treated individuals had a
weight loss (-1.4 kg and -1.7 kg) compared to an increase in
weight in the placebo group.
in the 52-week type 2 diabetes study [97] 498 individuals
were treated with either  xxxd2994xxx  at two different doses or
placebo. the average reduction in hba1c between week 4 52 was modest (0.3% and 0.4%), which, however, were statistically significant compared with placebo. these improvements in glycaemic control were accompanied by a reduction
in body weight (0.5 and 1.2 kg).

finally  xxxd2994xxx  administration for a total period of 2years [98] showed a reduction in hba1c of 0.43%. following
the 52-week placebo-controlled part of the study the reduction was almost maintained throughout the open labelled
study period (- 0.35% following 104 weeks). moreover, in
agreement with previous observations the greatest reduction
in hba1c was seen in these individuals who experienced a
reduction in hba1c of > 0.5% over the initial 4 weeks of the
study period.
in summary, evidence from long-term (26 - 104 weeks)
 xxxd2994xxx  administration to type 1 and insulin-treated
type 2 diabetic individuals demonstrates that addition of
 xxxd2994xxx  to the insulin regimen results in an improved glycaemic control. importantly, by evaluating the reduction in
hba1c following four weeks of treatment the studies were
able to identify a subset of individuals who experienced the
greatest benefit throughout the study period. moreover,
despite the improved glycaemic control, body weight was
reduced. from a safety point of view it should be noted that
the improved glycaemic control during  xxxd2994xxx  treatment
apparently was reached without an increase in the number of
severe hypoglycaemic events [92-97]. the most frequently
reported side effect of  xxxd2994xxx  in all studies was a slight
gastrointestinal discomfort which was dose-dependent and
subsided with time. these results have been summarised in
table 1.

conclusion and expert opinion

during the last decade large prospective intervention studies
have taught us that near-normal glycaemic control is pivotal
to minimise late complications in diabetes mellitus.
furthermore, the dcct [99] clearly demonstrated that one
hindrance to optimise the glycaemic control in type 1
diabetic individuals is an increased risk of severe hypoglycaemic episodes. the ukpds [100] evidenced that the
natural history of type 2 diabetes in terms of beta-cell
function and insulin resistance is complex and that none of
the treatment regimens used (sulphonylureas, metformin
and insulin) were outstanding in controlling glucose
homeostasis. new antidiabetic compounds have recently
been introduced to the market, e.g., short-acting and longacting insulin analogues, thiazolidinediones and prandial
glucose regulators. the pharmaceutical industry enthusiastically tries to improve the current treatment concepts as well
as they develop new drugs, e.g., glp-1 analogues, dppivinhibitors, glucagons antagonists, glycogen phosphorylase
inhibitors and non-thiazolidinedion ppar agonists.
the amylin analogue,  xxxd2994xxx , is one of these novel
drugs to be used as an adjunct to insulin therapy. the
rationale for amylin replacement has been defined during the
past few years after some confusion in the early 1990s. several
large-scale phase iii studies involving more than 3000

expert opin. investig. drugs (2001) 10(9)

nyholm, brock, ørskov & schmitz

diabetic individuals have demonstrated a beneficial effect of
amylin replacement on the hba1c level in both type 1 and 2
diabetes without an increased number of hypoglycaemic
events and weight gain. subgroup analyses demonstrated a
reduction in hba1c of 0.6 - 0.8% in patients with unaltered
insulin doses.  xxxd2994xxx  has been shown primarily to reduce
prandial glucose excursions, which have been suggested to
play a role in development of cardiovascular complications. it
could be argued that the reduction in hba1c after  xxxd2994xxx  treatment is quite modest but it is probably difficult to
obtain a greater reduction ‘on top of ’ the insulin regimen.
furthermore it is not clarified to what extend hba1c reflects
postprandial glucose excursions [64]. face-to-face comparison
with other antidiabetic compounds would be of interest.

what really would be a milestone is, however, to further characterise responders to amylin receptor agonists versus nonresponders in order to define which patients will benefit from
treatment. it is a potential achilles heel that  xxxd2994xxx  for
the time being has to be administrated as sc. injections two or
three times a day without being suitable for co-formulation
with regular or nph insulin.  xxxd2994xxx  is currently being
discussed both in the us and in europe for approval as an
adjunctive therapy for insulin treated.
in the future further insight into the human genome will
presumably help us to tailor the pharmacological treatment in
diabetes. in the meantime all antidiabetic compounds which
prove to be efficient and safe should be greeted welcome on
this very competitive and complex market.
