abstract
considerable evidence indicates that serotonergic mechanisms, particularly the serotonin transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ), may
mediate central effects of cocaine and may also be involved in impulsive and aggressive behavior. we investigated
whether polymorphisms in the  xxxg2150xxx  gene were related to traits of impulsivity, sensation seeking, and aggression
among cocaine abusers. standardized measures of these personality traits were obtained in a sample of 105 severely
affected cocaine-dependent african-american subjects and 44 african-american controls. two polymorphisms of the
 xxxg2150xxx  gene were examined involving the 59 promoter (5httlpr) region and a 17 base pair variable-number-tandemrepeat (vntr) marker among cocaine patients. no significant relationships were observed between polymorphic
variants of the 5httlpr and vntr regions and scores on any of the trait measures. similarly, demographic
variables and measures of severity of substance use and depression were unrelated to allele frequencies or genotype
distributions of the variants among cocaine patients. as expected, cocaine patients scored significantly higher on total
scores of impulsivity, aggression, and sensation seeking compared to controls. the findings do not seem to support
an association between these polymorphisms in the  xxxg2150xxx  gene and impulsive-aggressive traits among cocainedependent african-american individuals. 䊚 2002 elsevier science ireland ltd. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
several studies have found impulsive and
aggressive behaviors to be associated with deficits
in central serotonin function. for example, reduced
concentrations of cerebrospinal 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (csf-5hiaa), a serotonin metabolite,
have been reported among impulsive and aggressive individuals compared to controls (linnoila et
al., 1983; stanley et al., 2000). also, platelet
tritiated paroxetine binding, a measure of serotonin
uptake sites, has been found to be inversely correlated with impulsivity and aggression among
individuals with personality disorders (coccaro et
al., 1996). although substantial evidence suggests
that traits of impulsivity and aggression may be
related to cocaine abuse (brady et al., 1998; martin
et al., 1994), relatively few studies have explored
the link between serotonin dysfunction and impulsivity and aggression among cocaine abusers. most
of these studies have utilized hormonal responses
to serotonergic agents (e.g. meta-cholorophenylpiperazine) and found that alterations in these
responses were related to measures of aggression
and impulsivity among cocaine abusers (buydensbranchey et al., 1997; handelsman et al., 1998).
data derived from twin and adoption studies, as
well as studies of individuals with personality
disorders, suggest that traits of impulsive-aggression may be partially heritable (coccaro et al.,
1993; plomin et al., 1994). furthermore, dysfunction of central serotonergic neurotransmission may
be one of the genetically and environmentally
influenced biological variables that may contribute
towards substance abuse (kendler et al., 1995).
among young rhesus monkeys, heritable influences account for more than 60% of the variance
in csf 5-hiaa metabolite concentrations; moreover, aggressive behavior may be associated with
genetically determined concentrations of csf5hiaa (higley et al., 1996). however, among
adult human and non-human primates, the influence of heritable factors on the central serotonin
turnover is considerably less and environmental
factors account for more than 50% of the variance
(higley et al., 1993; oxenstierna et al., 1986).
these findings have led researchers to examine

whether variations in genes controlling serotonin
metabolism (e.g. the serotonin transporter and the
tryptophan hydroxylase genes) may underlie the
partially heritable influences on impulsive and
aggressive traits among humans. there is some
evidence to indicate that a polymorphism in the
tryptophan hydroxylase gene may be associated
with measures of impulsivity and aggression
among normal men and individuals with personality disorders (manuck et al., 1999; new et al.,
1998; evans et al., 2000).
recently, the serotonin transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ) has
generated considerable interest among behavioral
genetic researchers due to certain characteristics.
the  xxxg2150xxx  regulates the magnitude and duration
of serotonergic neurotransmission and serves as an
initial target site for antidepressants (graham and
langer, 1992; schloss and williams, 1998). neuroimaging studies have demonstrated high affinity
binding of the cocaine analogue w125ix-rti-55 to
the  xxxg2150xxx  sites in human brain, suggesting that
the htt may serve as a binding site for cocaine
(staley et al., 1994). clinical and postmortem
studies of cocaine addicts seem to support these
findings (jacobsen et al., 2000; little et al., 1998).
the human  xxxg2150xxx  protein is found to be encoded
by a single and a biallelic repeat polymorphism in
the 59 promotor region of  xxxg2150xxx  yielding a short
and a long variant of the allele (gelernter et al.,
1995; lesch et al., 1994; ramammorthy et al.,
1993). the short variant has been associated with
reduced transcriptional efficiency resulting in
reduced serotonin expression and uptake (lesch et
al., 1996). another polymorphism involves a 17
base pair variable-number-tandem-repeat (vntr)
region located in the second intron of the  xxxg2150xxx 
gene with two common alleles and one rare allele
(lesch et al., 1994; ogilvie et al., 1996). in two
large studies from the us, the 5httlpr polymorphism was found to be associated with anxietyrelated traits (greenberg et al., 2000; lesch et al.,
1996). moreover, harm avoidance and the impulsivity and anger-hostility components of neuroticism were strongly associated with the short
genotype in lesch and colleagues’ study. similar
results were also obtained from a study of japanese
volunteers (katsuragi et al., 1999). however, other
studies attempting to replicate these findings have

ly reduced tritiated paroxetine binding (bmax) compared to controls; also, bmax was inversely
correlated with measures of aggression, impulsivity, and sensation seeking among cocaine patients
(patkar et al., in press). since bmax of paroxetine
binding is believed to reflect the density of platelet
transporter sites (coccaro et al., 1996), platelet
serotonin uptake is reported to be influenced by
genetic variations in the  xxxg2150xxx  (greenberg et al.,
1999), and traits of impulsivity-aggression are
substantially heritable (coccaro et al., 1993), we
hypothesized that measures of impulsivity, aggression, and sensation seeking were related to polymorphisms in the  xxxg2150xxx  gene among
cocaine-dependent individuals. to test our hypothesis, we selected a clinical sample of severely
affected african-american cocaine-dependent
patients, determined the genotypes resulting from
the 5htttlpr and vntr polymorphisms, and
compared the distribution of behavioral measures
among the different genotype groups.
2. methods

yielded negative findings (ball et al., 1997;
ebstein et al., 1997; gelernter et al., 1998; gustavsson et al., 1999). although the vntr polymorphism has been linked to susceptibility to
anxiety and depression in some studies (evans et
al., 1997; ogilvie et al., 1996), others have failed
to find such an association (stober et al., 1996;
hoehe et al., 1998).
most candidate gene studies among substance
abusers from the us have primarily recruited
individuals of european background and investigated alcohol dependence. there is relatively limited published data examining serotonin genes in
cocaine abuse, a major public health problem in
the us that particularly affects minority populations. in a previous study, we observed no significant differences in  xxxg2150xxx  gene polymorphisms
among african-american cocaine-dependent individuals and controls (patkar et al., 2001). however, in this study, we did not examine the
relationship of the transporter polymorphisms with
traits of impulsivity and aggression, reported to be
linked to serotonergic mechanisms (linnoila et al.,
1983). furthermore, we recently observed that
african-american cocaine abusers had significant-

2.1. subjects
one hundred and five subjects were recruited
from individuals attending a publicly funded, university-affiliated, intensive outpatient cocaine
treatment program that serves a predominantly
inner-city population in philadelphia. following a
complete description of the study, written informed
consent using an institutional review board—
approved consent form was obtained from all
subjects. the structured clinical interview (scid)
for dsm-iv axis i disorders (first et al., 1997)
was then administered to individuals who volunteered for the study. individuals with a diagnosis
of schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, a serious medical
illness, pregnancy or receiving psychotropic medications were excluded. if patients used more than
one substance, they were included only if their
primary drug was cocaine. urine drug screens
were obtained for all subjects as a part of routine
clinical intake.
nearly 92% of the patient population in our
treatment program were african-american, and the

106

a.a. patkar et al. / psychiatry research 110 (2002) 103–115

study sample was restricted to african-american
subjects to represent the clinical population of
cocaine abusers and to minimize any possible
ethnic variations in allele frequencies. furthermore, only subjects who reported cocaine use in
the previous 30 days on the addiction severity
index (asi), who had history of substance abuse
in one or more immediate family members (parents, siblings), and who had onset of regular
cocaine use before age 25 were included. the
family history was elicited by items on the family
history section of the asi. the sample was restricted to individuals with early age of onset of regular
cocaine use, inability to sustain abstinence, and
having one or more first degree affected relatives
to define a subset of severely affected cocainedependent patients with a high heritability risk
(mcgue et al., 1992). the likelihood of detecting
susceptibility genes is considered to be higher in
such phenotypes (berrettini and persico, 1996).
forty-four african-american controls were
recruited from those responding to local advertisements. consent and screening procedures were
similar to those followed for cocaine subjects.
control subjects were excluded if they had a
history of substance abuse (except tobacco), had
a major psychiatric disorder (schizophrenia, major
depression or bipolar disorder), had a positive
urine drug screen, or were taking psychotropic
medications.
2.2. personality and psychopathology assessments
all subjects had their medical health documented by medical history and physical examination
and were assessed using a battery of psychological
tests. the instruments were selected based on
evidence of significant heritability for traits of
sensation seeking (zuckerman, 2002) and impulsive-aggression (lesch and merschdorf, 2000),
previous studies linking scores on these scales to
indices of serotonergic function (buydens-branchey et al., 1997; coccaro et al., 1996), and
published literature that examined relationships
between impulsive aggression and polymorphisms
in candidate genes (manuck et al., 1999; reist et
al., 2001; vanyukov et al., 1998). these included
the sensation seeking scale-form v (sss) (zuck-

erman, 1993), the buss-durkee hostility inventory
(bdhi) (buss and durkee, 1957) and the barratt
impulsivity scale (bis) (barratt, 1985). addiction
severity was assessed using the addiction severity
index (asi) (mclellan et al., 1992). the asi was
performed only on cocaine subjects.
the sss (form v) is a widely used 40-item
self-report questionnaire which provides a total
sensation seeking score as well as scores on four
subscales assessing disinhibition, thrill and adventure seeking, experience seeking, and boredom
susceptibility. the sss has been tested extensively
in twin studies (fulker et al., 1980; hur and
bouchard, 1997; jinks and fulker, 1970; koopmans et al., 1995) and has been found to have
high heritability (0.56–0.63) for total scores and
various subscale component scores. moreover,
items on the sss have been found to be highly
correlated with items on the temperament and
character inventory (cloninger et al., 1994) and
eysenck’s personality questionnaire (eysenck and
eysenck, 1985; zuckerman and cloninger, 1995).
the sss has also been used to assess relationships
between candidate gene polymorphisms and measures of personality in substance abusers (vanyukov
et al., 1998). the bdhi is a 75-item questionnaire
composed of two main factors (motor aggression
and hostility) and eight subscales. the motor
aggression factor is composed of four subscales
(direct, indirect, verbal and irritability), while the
hostility factor is composed of two subscales
(resentment and suspiciousness). the remaining
subscales measure guilt and negativism. reliability
and validity have been established for the instrument (buss and durkee, 1957). the bdhi has
been used to examine the relationship between
impulsive–aggression and serotonin gene polymorphisms (new et al., 1998; manuck et al.,
1999), as well as polymorphisms in adrenergic
and monoamine oxidase enzyme genes (comings
et al., 2000; manuck et al., 2000). the bis is
another well-known, 34-item self-report questionnaire to measure different dimensions of impulsivity. it contains three subscales which measure
motor, cognitive and non-planning impulsivity.
this scale has been used to measure impulsivity
in a recent study examining the relationship
between serotonin gene polymorphisms and impul-

a.a. patkar et al. / psychiatry research 110 (2002) 103–115

sive personality traits (preuss et al., 2000; reist et
al., 2001). the addiction severity index (asi) is
a structured interview assessing the severity and
patterns of drug and alcohol use and impairment
in employment, medical, legal, familyysocial and
psychiatric domains of functioning. the asi has
been extensively used in clinical and research
settings.
2.3. molecular genetics
genomic dna was isolated from anticoagulated
venous blood using methods described by miller
et al. (1988) and two different polymorphisms in
the  xxxg2150xxx  gene were analyzed: a biallelic functional polymorphism in the 59 promoter region
(5httlpr) wherein 44 base pairs (bp) are either
inserted or deleted yielding a 484 bp (short form
designated s) or a 528 bp (long form designated
l) fragment (heils et al., 1996); and a polymorphism in a variable-number-tandem-repeat
(vntr) region located in intron 2 with three
alleles consisting of 9, 10 or 12 copies of the 17
bp repeat (lesch et al., 1994). polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) based amplification of the 59 promoter region was performed as described by heils
et al. (1996) and the vntr region was amplified
as described by ogilvie et al. (1996). the amplified fragments were separated on agarose gels and
bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and ultraviolet illumination. genotypes were
evaluated by two independent investigators who
were blind to the status of the subject, and any
discrepancies were resolved by test replication.
2.4. statistical analyses
the number of controls (ns44) was small for
genetic analyses, and therefore comparisons
between subjects and controls, were performed on
personality and not genetic variables. the allele
frequencies and genotype distributions of the polymorphic variants of the 5httlpr and vntr
regions were calculated. the primary behavioral
measures were total and subscale scores on bdhi,
bis, sss and asi. demographic variables were
compared across different genotype groups and

107

between subjects and controls using x2- and t-tests
(two-tailed). personality variables were compared
between cocaine patients and controls, and
between different genotypes of cocaine patients
using t-tests (two-tailed) with corrections for unequal variances where necessary or one-way analysis of variance (anova) as appropriate.
correlations between variables were performed
using pearson product-moment or point-biserial
correlations as appropriate.
2.5. power considerations
we tested the hypothesis that cocaine patients
will demonstrate significantly higher levels of
impulsivity, aggression and sensation seeking compared to controls and that these behavioral measures will be associated with polymorphisms in the
5httlpr and vntr regions in cocaine patients.
we initially computed the power to detect significant differences between cocaine subjects (ns
105) and controls (ns44) in the various
behavioral measures (summarized in table 2)
employing general linear model univariate analysis (spss, 1999). with one-tailed a set at 0.05,
the power to detect between-group differences in
scores on the bdhi (aggression) was 0.996
(adjusted r 2s0.16); on the sss (sensation seeking) was 0.964 (adjusted r 2s0.12) and on the
bis (impulsivity) was 0.866 (adjusted r 2s0.05).
the next set of analyses involved calculating the
power to detect an association between the various
behavioral measures and genotypes resulting from
the  xxxg2150xxx  polymorphisms. since no published data
found a relationship between impulsive-aggression
and  xxxg2150xxx  genotypes for substance-dependent individuals, we relied on our data that found a significant relationship between platelet  xxxg2150xxx  sites and
impulsivity-aggression (patkar et al., in press) and
published literature that found a significant association between bdhi scores of aggression and
polymorphisms in the trytophan hydroxylase gene
in 40 patients with mixed personality disorders
(new et al., 1998). in our study, a significant
correlation was observed between measures of
aggression (bdhi) and impulsivity (bis, sss)

108

a.a. patkar et al. / psychiatry research 110 (2002) 103–115

and bmax values of tritiated paroxetine binding (a
measure of  xxxg2150xxx  sites) (p-0.01 for bdhi, p0.001 for bis, sss, r ranged from 0.25 to 0.65)
among 105 cocaine patients (effect size f s0.62).
similarly, in the new et al. (1998) study, the effect
size ( f ) was strong ()0.4) as defined by cohen
(1988). we therefore assumed a similar effect size
( f s0.5) for the current study, particularly since
we attempted to reduce heterogeneity in our sample by defining a severely affected phenotype of
similar ethnic background (gershon et al., 1986).
with one-tailed a set at 0.05, with ns105, the
current study had a power of 0.81 to detect main
effects of the  xxxg2150xxx  polymorphism on the various
behavioral measures. based on these power considerations, we anticipated our sample size would
be sufficient to be able to address the research
questions of the study.
3. results
3.1. sample
from a total of 156 african-american (aa)
cocaine-dependent subjects volunteering for the
study, 105 fulfilled the criteria of onset of regular
use before age 25 and having one or more affected
family members. thus, the study sample comprised 105 aa patients with cocaine dependence
and 44 aa controls. the patients (71.5% male)
and controls (59.1% male) did not differ significantly in gender (x2s2.16, d.f.s1, ps0.33).
however, patients (36.57"6.40 were significantly
older than controls (32.77"5.74) (ts3.41, d.f.s
147, p-0.01). also, patients (85%) were significantly more likely to be unemployed compared to
controls (29%) (x2s40.6, d.f.s1, p-0.001).
similarly, significant differences were observed
between patients (74% single) and controls (47%
single) in marital status (x2s6.1, d.f.s1, p0.01). the mean age of first drug use was
18.95"5.12 years. cocaine patients on average
had used cocaine for 14.68"4.78 years; the average use was six rocks per day, and more than 95%
used cocaine on a daily basis. the mean number
of prior treatments for cocaine dependency was
four. nearly 85% of subjects fulfilled all seven
dsm-iv criteria of cocaine dependence. the

admission urine sample for 37% of the patients
was positive for cocaine, indicating that more than
one third of patients were actively using cocaine
at the time of admission. of the 63% of patients
who were abstinent, the average length of abstinence prior to admission was 15.8 days.
the allele frequencies and genotype distributions of the 5httlpr and vntr polymorphisms
among cocaine-dependent individuals are shown
in table 1. no significant relationships were found
between age and distribution of the 5httlpr
(fs0.82, ps0.44) or vntr (fs0.03, ps0.97)
genotypes. similarly, no significant differences
were observed in the distribution of sex among
the different genotypes of the 5httlpr (x2s
0.36, d.f.s2, ps0.83) or the vntr (x2s1.07,
d.f.s2, ps0.58) polymorphism. the data were
then analyzed to determine whether the pattern of
cocaine use was related to the transporter polymorphisms. no significant associations were found
between the 5httlpr genotypes on the one hand
and admission urine drug screen (x2s1.48, d.f.s
2, ps0.43), quantity (fs0.55, ps0.57), frequency (fs0.43, ps0.65) or duration of cocaine use
(fs0.34, ps0.72), age of first drug use (fs
0.82, ps0.44) or length of abstinence (fs1.12,
ps0.26) on the other. also, vntr genotypes
were not significantly related to admission urine
drug screen (x2s2.04, d.f.s2, ps0.27), quantity
(fs0.26, ps0.77), frequency (fs1.01, ps
0.37) or duration of cocaine use (fs0.48, ps
0.61), age of first drug use (fs0.21, ps0.81) or
length of abstinence (fs0.78, ps0.41).
a significant proportion of the cocaine-dependent subjects had additional current and lifetime
substance abuse and dependence diagnoses,
reflecting the clinical population in urban treatment
settings. however, no significant differences were
found in genotype distribution of the 5httlpr
or vntr polymorphisms among patients with
cocaine dependence alone and those with current
or lifetime alcohol dependence and abuse (all x22.02, p)0.05). with respect to other major substances (opioid and marijuana) also, no relationship was observed between genotypes of both
polymorphisms and axis i substance use diagnoses
(all x2-1.65, p)0.05).

3.2. personality and psychopathology measures:
patients vs. controls
as summarized in table 2, cocaine patients
showed significantly higher total scores and scores
on the cognitive subscale of the bis compared to
controls also, the patients obtained significantly
higher total scores as well as higher scores on the
disinhibition and thrill seeking subscales of the
sss compared to controls. similar differences were
found on most measures of aggression from the
bdhi. these included the total score and the
subscale scores measuring assault, indirect aggression, irritability, resentment and suspicion. no
significant group differences were observed for the
remainder of the subscales on the bis, the sss
and the bdhi. we also examined and found no
significant relationships between demographic
characteristics, including age, gender, employment,
and marital status, and scores on the bdhi, bis
and sss (x2-0.84, r-0.14, p)0.05 in each case)
among patients and controls.

3.3. relationship between 5httlpr and vntr
polymorphisms and measures of personality and
psychopathology among cocaine patients
as summarized in table 3, no significant relationships were found between genotypes of the
5httlpr and vntr polymorphisms and the total
scores on the bdhi, bis, sss and asi. also,
scores on the different subscales of the bdhi,
bis, sss and asi showed no significant relationships with either 5httlpr or vntr genotypes
(f values ranged from 0.02 to 2.24 for 5httlpr
genotypes and from 0.07 to 1.94 for vntr genotypes; p)0.05 in each case). we also examined
the data by comparing the ll genotype with a
combination of lys and sys genotypes and the
12y12 genotype with a combination of 10y12 and
10y10 genotypes as suggested by lesch et al.
(1996) and gustavsson et al. (1999). no significant relationships emerged between the various
personality and psychopathology assessments and

the 5httlpr (all t-1.62, p)0.05) or the vntr
genotype (all t-1.33, p)0.05).
3.4. correlations between subscale scores of personality assessments and 5httlpr and vntr
genotypes
we also examined the relationship of impulsivity, aggression and sensation seeking with the
5httlpr and vntr genotypes by performing a
factor analysis of the sss, bdhi and bis to
extract different components that may be related
to the genotypes (principal component analysis
for extraction, varimax rotation). the factor analysis revealed that a single component was extracted from each of the three scales indicating that the
instruments assessed separate dimensions of impulsivity, sensation seeking and hostility. the extraction scores ranged from 0.582 to 0.873 for the
subscales of the bdhi (component 1), 0.891–
0.922 for the different bis subscales (component

a.a. patkar et al. / psychiatry research 110 (2002) 103–115

2) and 0.747–0.820 for the subscales of the sss
(component 3). since each instrument appeared to
measure separate components, we performed correlations (point-biserial correlation) of subscale
scores of each scale with 5httlpr and vntr
genotypes. the results are summarized in table 4.
as seen from table 4, no significant correlations
were observed between subscale scores on the
bdhi, bis and sss and genotypes resulting from
polymorphism in the 5httlpr and vntr
regions of the serotonin transporter.
4. discussion
consistent with the research literature (moeller
et al., 1994; yudofsky et al., 1993), cocaine
patients reported higher scores on several measures
of impulsivity, aggression and sensation seeking
compared to controls. however, contrary to our
expectations, no significant relationships were
found between the 5httlpr and vntr polymorphisms in the  xxxg2150xxx  gene and scores on various measures of impulsivity, aggression and
sensation seeking among cocaine-dependent individuals. also, genotype distribution among cocaine
patients was not influenced by demographic characteristics such as age and gender, and additional
axis i substance use diagnoses. the personality
assessments used in this study have been widely
used in research studies and found to correlate
with biological and genetic indices of serotonergic
function in clinical and non-clinical populations
(manuck et al., 1999; coccaro et al., 1996).
the sensation seeking scale (zuckerman,
1993) used in the present study has been found to
be highly correlated with items on the tridimensional personality questionnaire (cloninger, 1987)
and the temperament and character inventory
(cloninger et al., 1994). in this respect, our findings using the sss are at variance with other
studies from america, israel and japan that reported a relationship between harm avoidance scores
on the tpq and 5httlpr genotypes (lesch et
al., 1996; osher et al., 2000; katsuragi et al.,
1999). differences in sample characteristics and
methodology could account in part for the discrepancies in our findings. for example, lesch et al.
(1996) studied primarily anxiety-related traits in

111

non-addicted individuals of european background
while the present study examined measures of
impulsivity and aggression among african-american cocaine users.
the allele frequencies in the present sample
were not significantly different from those reported
in other published studies of alcohol abusers
(sander et al., 1998; edenberg et al., 1998). we
selected a group of severely addicted individuals
who had significantly higher impulsivity and
aggression compared to controls and who had
affected first-degree relatives in the expectation
that the presumed relationship between personality
traits and a functional candidate allele would be
increased in such an extreme sample (lander and
shork, 1994). however, failure to detect a relationship between traits of impulsivity and aggression and  xxxg2150xxx  genotypes does not necessarily
indicate that the  xxxg2150xxx  transporter gene does not
contribute to these personality traits. a possibility
remains that the  xxxg2150xxx  polymorphism itself may
not mediate susceptibility to these personality
traits, but rather exert its effect through another
unknown polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium
with the present one.
unlike reports of an association between severity of symptoms and a polymorphism in the  xxxg2150xxx 
gene among some studies of alcoholics (sander et
al., 1997), we did not find a relationship between
 xxxg2150xxx  genotypes and severity of drug use among
cocaine addicts. this may represent a true lack of
relationship or, alternatively, it might be because
we studied a severely affected sample and did not
have sufficient variation in the patterns of cocaine
use to observe possible relationships. it is also
worth noting that the differences in the present
study were not only non-significant, but also very
small for practical purposes. for example, one of
the strongest differences was that of total sensation
seeking score compared across the distribution of
the promoter genotypes with f2,102s1.33. this
analysis’ effect size was f s0.113, falling into the
‘small’ category of cohen (1988). with ns105,
p-0.05, the power of this effect was only 0.16.
the smallness of this effect was illustrated by the
fact that in order to increase the power to 0.80,
approximately 750 subjects would be necessary.
similarly, differences on the barratt impulsivity

112

a.a. patkar et al. / psychiatry research 110 (2002) 103–115

scale score among the vntr genotypes, f2,101s
0.432, represented a power of only 0.08. to
achieve a power of 0.80 would have required an
n-value of 2340. in this context, certain limitations
of the study deserve comment. reflecting clinical
patient population, the cocaine-dependent individuals used a variety of other substances and some
were court-mandated. although we found no
effects of additional substance abuseydependence
on our findings and corrected for antisocial behavior by excluding criminal justice patients, a formal
diagnostic evaluation for personality disorders was
not performed. also, it is possible that in addition
to the  xxxg2150xxx  polymorphisms, other transcriptional
or non-genetic factors may be involved in regulating the levels of transporter protein (ordway,
2000). similarly, environmental factors may interact with psychopathological variables such as
impulsivity and aggression, and could confound
the relationship between biological and behavioral
variables. while we found no significant relationships between demographic variables such as
employment and marital status and behavioral
measures, data on social status were not available
and may have possibly affected the results.
in conclusion, the present study could not detect
an association between  xxxg2150xxx  genotypes and traits
of impulsivity, sensation seeking and aggression
among african-american cocaine-dependent individuals. it should be noted, though, that association
studies of unrelated individuals, such as reported
here, warrant cautious interpretation as unknown
sources of population stratification may affect the
results (greenberg et al., 1998). also, in multifactorial disorders such as cocaine dependence, the
phenotype is likely to reflect a complex interaction
between several genes and environmental factors.
further studies, preferably using family based
association approaches and on different ethnic
groups, are required to clarify the influence of
serotonergic genes on addictive disorders and personality correlates of such behavior.
