 xxxd3159xxx  (sa), an endogenous signaling molecule of plants, possesses anti-inflammatory
and anti-neoplastic actions in human. its derivative,
aspirin, is the most commonly used anti-inflammatory
and analgesic drug. aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  (salicylates) have been reported to have multiple pharmacological actions. however, it is unclear whether they
bind to a cellular protein. here, we report for the first
time the purification from human fibroblasts of a ⬃78
kda salicylate binding protein with sequence identity to
immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (bip).
the kd values of sa binding to crude extract and to
recombinant bip were 45.2 and 54.6 ␮m, respectively.
bip is a chaperone protein containing a polypeptide
binding site recognizing specific heptapeptide sequence and an atp binding site. a heptapeptide with
the specific sequence displaced sa binding in a concentration-dependent manner whereas a control heptapeptide did not. salicylates inhibited atpase activity stimulated by this specific heptapeptide but did not block
atp binding or induce bip expression. these results
indicate that salicylates bind specifically to the polypeptide binding site of bip in human cells that may
interfere with folding and transport of proteins important in inflammation.—deng, w.-g., ruan, k.-h., du,

 xxxd3159xxx  (sa) is a natural signaling molecule for
activation of plant defense mechanism and is a pharmacological agent for controlling the inflammatory
response in humans. it has been shown in plant cells
that sa is synthesized in response to environmental
injury (1) and serves as a messenger molecule to induce
the expression of plant defense-related genes (2). sa
was identified as the active component of willow bark
extracts that were shown to have anti-inflammatory
properties more than a century ago.  xxxd234xxx

matory drugs (3). recent studies have shown that sa
and aspirin also have anti-neoplastic properties (4).
the mechanisms by which sa and aspirin exert these
pharmacological actions in human are unclear. several
studies suggest that sa suppresses leukocyte activation
and adhesion to endothelial cells (5, 6) and enhances
cancer cell apoptosis (7, 8). these cellular activities
have been attributed to inhibition by sa of i␬b-kinase
activity and i␬b degradation with the consequent inhibition of nuclear factor ␬b (nf-␬b) activation (9, 10).
other signaling mechanisms have also been proposed
(11–13). the concentrations of sa (⬎5 mm) able to
inhibit nf-␬b activation are suprapharmacological, as
previously reported (14); at such high concentrations,
sa inhibits many mammalian cell kinases in a nonspecific manner. it is thus unlikely that the pharmacological actions of sa and aspirin can be explained by
suppression of nf-␬b activation. we have reported that
sa and aspirin at pharmacological concentrations
(10⫺5 to 10⫺3 m) suppress  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2)
transcription induced by proinflammatory cytokines
and mitogenic factors (15). a recent report has also
shown that salicylate at a pharmacological concentration selectively inhibits binding of ccaat/enhancer
binding protein ␤ (c/ebp␤) to cox-2 promoter (16).
since cox-2 plays an important role in inflammation
(17, 18) and tumorigenesis (19), this action of aspirin
and sa provides a more plausible explanation for their
anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic effects.
work from klessig’s group suggests that the action of
sa on plant cells is mediated by sa binding to plant
catalase, resulting in an elevation of h2o2, which is a
proposed signaling molecule in plant gene expression
(20, 21). this proposal was questioned by a report
showing that sa bound not only to catalase, but also to
other iron-containing enzymes in plant cells (22). it was
also reported that sa bound to bovine catalase at
relatively high concentrations (3 mm and higher).
thus, it remains unclear whether sa at pharmacologi1

cal concentrations binds to a human cellular protein.
here we report the purification of a protein from crude
extract of human fibroblasts that exhibited specific
binding to sa with a kd of 45.2 ␮m. amino acid
sequence of the nh2-terminal region of this purified
sa binding protein was identical to that of human
immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (bip).
the purified 78 kda protein was recognized by a
human anti-bip antibody. bip is a chaperone protein
containing a polypeptide site recognizing specific heptapeptide sequences and an atp binding site. aspirin
and salicylate bound specifically to the polypeptide
binding site and inhibited the bip atpase activity.

materials and methods
cell culture and treatment
human foreskin fibroblasts (hff) were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1:100 dilution of an antibiotic-antimycotic
solution. when cells reached 80 –90% confluence, medium
was removed and replaced with serum-free medium for 24 h.
after washing, cells were harvested and lysed with a lysis
buffer (50 mm tris-hcl ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm edta,
1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 5
␮g/ml aprotinin, 1% nonidet p40, 0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , and 0.1%  xxxd3215xxx ).
[14c] sa binding assay
sa binding assays were carried out as described (23) with
some modifications. in brief, 0.5 ml of binding mixture
containing 10 mm citrate ph 6.5, 10 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1 mm
edta, 2 mg protein, and increasing concentrations of
[14c]sa (12.9 ci/mol) was incubated at 4°c for 2 h in the
presence or absence of a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled
salicylate. bound and free [14c]sa were separated by a
spin-column exclusion chromatography with a p-6dg desalting gel column (bio-rad, hercules, ca). the radioactivity was
measured with a ␤-scintillation counter. specific binding
isotherms were constructed by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. kd and bmax were calculated by a
double reciprocal plot.
extraction and purification of sa binding protein(s)
sa binding proteins were purified from hff lysates by
binding activity-guided stepwise chromatography similar to
the procedure reported (20). the cell lysate was centrifuged
and the supernatant was brought to 50% of ammonium
sulfate saturation. the precipitate was collected after centrifugation and dissolved in a binding buffer (10 mm citrate ph
6.5, 10 mm  xxxd2534xxx  and 1 mm edta). this crude extract was
then dialyzed against the same binding buffer overnight and
centrifuged to remove undissolved fractions before sa binding assay. the extract was desalted on a sephadex g-25
column (pharmacia, piscataway, nj) equilibrated with binding buffer, followed by deae-sephacel chromatography on a
2.5 ⫻ 15 cm column (pharmacia) using a kcl gradient from
0 to 1.0 mm at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. sa binding activity
of the eluted fractions was analyzed and the fractions with sa
binding activity were pooled and chromatographed on a blue
dextran-agarose column (0.5⫻15 cm) (sigma, st. louis, mo)
2464

at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with binding buffer containing
0.5 m kcl. the active fractions were combined, concentrated,
and injected (0.1/ml per run) into a superose 6 hr 10/30
column (pharmacia) connected to an hplc system (waters,
millford, ma). fractions were eluted with binding buffer at a
flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. the active fractions were pooled and
concentrated. protein concentration was measured using a
protein assay kit (bio-rad).
protein separation and microsequencing
proteins in various chromatographic preparations were resolved in 12% polyacrylamide gels by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). protein
bands were detected by coomassie blue staining. molecular
weight markers were included to estimate the molecular
weight of sa binding proteins. active fractions obtained from
the final superose 6 hr chromatography step contained
two discrete bands. each band was electroblotted to a
pvdf membrane, excised from the gel, and sequenced with
applied biosystems 473a sequencer at baylor college of
medicine.
preparation of recombinant bip protein
a full coding sequence of human cdna of bip was inserted
into a  xxxg1073xxx  (gst) expression vector
pgex-4t-1 (pharmacia) and transformed into escherichia coli
strain bl21. expression of recombinant gst-bip fusion proteins was induced by isopropyl ␤-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1
mm). bip proteins were purified with a glutathione sepharose 4b column (pharmacia) after digesting gst-bip with
thrombin. this recombinant human bip has been shown
to have identical biochemical properties as purified bovine
bip (24).
western blotting analysis
purified recombinant bip and purified sa binding protein
preparations were separated by sds-page, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed
with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against human bip (stressgen, victoria, b.c., canada) using an ecl detection kit
(pharmacia).
atpase measurement
the atpase was assayed by measuring the free pi liberated
during atp hydrolysis according to a method previously
described (24). the standard assay was carried out at 37°c in
20 ␮l of reaction mixture containing 1 ␮g bip, 0.1 ␮m
[␥-32p]atp for 30 min, then 20 ␮l of 4% sds was added to
stop the reaction. the reaction mixture were extracted with
50 ␮l fresh phosphate reagent and 200 ␮l 65:35 xylene:
isobutyl alcohol. a 50 ␮l aliquot was removed from the upper
organic phase and the released pi radioactivity was counted in
a liquid scintillation counter.
atp binding assay
binding of atp was determined by using a nitrocellulose
filter assay as described previously (25). the mixtures for
incubation (20 ␮l total) contained 8 ␮g of bip, 20 mm
bis-tris, ph 7.0, 2 mm mgcl2, 30 mm kcl, 3 ␮m [3h]atp,
and various concentrations of sa. trace levels of adp in
mixtures were removed by adding 0.3 ␮g of pyruvate kinase
and 30 ␮m phosphoenolpyruvate. the reaction was stopped

the faseb journal

deng et al.

by addition of 3 ml of 10 mm bis-tris, ph 7.0, containing 2
mm mgcl2, followed by rapid filtration through a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 ␮m). the filter was washed three times with 5
ml wash buffer. radioactivity on the filter was determined
with a liquid scintillation spectrometer.
synthesis of heptapeptides
a heptapeptide with a sequence of kywwnll corresponding
to a sequence in  xxxg706xxx  of human immune deficiency virus
(26) reported to have a high affinity for human bip and a
control heptapeptide with a sequence of twfnstw without
binding activity for bip were synthesized (sigma-genosys,
woodlands, tx) and used in evaluating competition with
[14c]sa binding to bip.

results
the 50% ammonium sulfate fraction of hff lysates
exhibited specific sa binding activity and kinetic analysis revealed a single binding with a kd value of 45.2 ␮m
(fig. 1a). sa binding was reversed by addition of 1 mm
sa at 60 min of binding experiment (fig. 1b). the sa
binding activity was disrupted by pretreatment of the
cell extract with trypsin (20 ␮g/ml) or 0.5% sds (data
not shown), consistent with binding to a protein in the
cell extracts. to purify the sa binding protein, the cell
extract was subject to sephadex g-25 chromatography
for desalting, followed by sa binding activity-guided
stepwise deae-sephacel chromatography (fig. 2a),
blue dextran-agarose chromatography (fig. 2b), and
superose 6 hr chromatography (fig. 2c). active fractions from each chromatography step were pooled,
concentrated, and the proteins in these fractions were
separated by sds-page. after the final chromatography step, a major band at 78 kda and a minor band at
56 kda were detected (fig. 3a). these two bands were
excised and subject to microsequencing. a 15 amino
acid sequence of the 78 kda band was obtained, and
sequence comparison shows that it is identical to the
first 15 amino acid sequence of mature human bip
(fig. 3b). we were unable to obtain the sequence of the
minor band because of nh2-terminal block. table 1
summarized the purification of this 78 kda sa binding
protein. we obtained a 103-fold purification after four
steps of chromatography. in view of a 100% sequence
identity of the nh2-terminal 15 amino acid residues of
our purified protein to that of human bip, this purified
protein is probably bip. to support this, we performed
western blot analysis of the purified protein preparation using an anti-human bip antibody. the anti-bip
antibody recognized a single 78 kda band of our
purified protein preparation, which migrated to a
position on the gel identical to that of authentic human
bip expressed in e. coli (fig. 3c). thus, our purified
protein is biochemically and antigenically identical to
human bip. these results led us to conclude that bip is
a major sa binding protein in human fibroblasts. we
therefore carried out subsequent binding experiments
with purified human recombinant bip.

line denotes dissociation of binding after addition of unlabeled sa; the solid line indicates no addition of unlabeled sa.

the kinetics of sa binding to purified human bip
was determined by using [14c]sa at concentrations
from 0 –200 ␮m in the presence and absence of a
1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled sa. sa bound to
bip in a specific, saturable manner and double reciprocal analysis revealed a single binding site with a kd of
54.6 ␮m and a bmax of 263 pmol/mg bip (fig. 4a). the
binding parameters initially obtained using crude cell
extracts (fig. 1a) matched remarkably well with those
of purified bip, confirming that bip is the sa binding
protein in human cells. we next determined the relative potency of aspirin and several sa metabolites or
analogs in competing with sa binding by adding a
slightly more than 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled
aspirin or analogs (5 mm) to [14c] sa (40 ␮m), which
was incubated with purified bip, and the specific sa
binding activity was determined. at this molar excess,
unlabeled sa inhibited [14c]sa binding by ⬃90%
using vehicle control as the reference. aspirin has a

comparable inhibition as sa. of several  xxxd30xxx  ( xxxd30xxx ) compounds tested, 2,6- xxxd30xxx  was
equivalent to aspirin in inhibiting sa binding whereas
2,5- xxxd30xxx , 2,3- xxxd30xxx , and 3,5- xxxd30xxx  showed decreasing inhibiting potency (fig. 4b). 3,4-dimethylbenzoic
acid (3,4-dmba) inhibited sa binding by only ⬃20%
whereas 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-hba) did not significantly inhibit sa binding.
the bip molecule comprises an atpase domain at
the nh2-terminal region that binds atp and hydrolyzes
it to adp and a peptide binding domain at the carboxyl-terminal region that binds polypeptide with specific
heptapeptide sequences (27, 28). sa did not inhibit
atp binding to recombinant bip (fig. 5a). to determine whether sa bound to the peptide binding site, we
synthesized a heptapeptide (kywwnll) based on a
sequence in hiv  xxxg706xxx  that was reported to bind bip
with a kapp of 60 ␮m and a control sequence (twfnstw) also based on the hiv  xxxg706xxx  sequence, which
was reported to bind poorly to bip (kapp⬎500 ␮m)
(26). the active peptide competed with [14c]sa binding in a concentration-dependent manner whereas the
control peptide had no effect on sa binding (fig. 5b).
these results suggest that sa binds to the peptide
binding site of bip. peptide binding to bip stimulates
the bip atpase activity that converts atp to adp,
thereby closing the peptide binding pocket (28). we

determine whether sa inhibits atpase activity stimulated by the active peptide. both sa and aspirin inhibited the basal atpase activity in a concentration-dependent manner whereas the inactive benzoate 3,4-dmba
did not (fig. 6a). sa at 100 ␮m also significantly
inhibited atpase activity stimulated by 1 mm active
peptide whereas 3,4-dmba had no effect on atpase
activity (fig. 6b). these results further support the
binding of sa to the peptide binding site of bip.
it is suggested that reduced availability of free bip as
a result of bip complexing with misfolded proteins
signals the induction of bip expression (28). to test
whether sa binding to bip transmitted a signal for bip
overexpression, we treated hff with high concentrations of sa or its analogs and determined bip levels. bip
proteins were constitutively expressed in control hff
and neither sa nor aspirin altered the bip protein
levels (fig. 7). similarly, neither 2,6- xxxd30xxx  nor 2,5dhba altered the bip protein level (fig. 7). endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress has been reported to induce
the expression of c/ebp homologous protein (chop)
(29). chop forms heterodimers with c/ebp and suppresses transcriptional activation by c/ebp. since
c/ebp␤ is a key transactivator of cox-2 promoter and
salicylate suppresses cox-2 promoter activity by inhibiting c/ebp␤ binding to a proximal regulatory element on cox-2 promoter (16), we determined

discussion
we have purified from human fibroblasts a 78 kda sa
binding protein that shares sequence identity with
human bip as well as antigenic and sa binding
properties. the sequence of our purified protein
matches perfectly the first 15 amino acid sequence of
mature bip protein. the purified protein was recogtable 1. purification of sa binding  xxxd3240xxx

salicylate binding protein

nized by an antibody against human bip, migrated to
the same position on sds-page as purified recombinant bip, and had a molecular weight matching
human bip. sa binding kinetics of the whole cell
extracts also matched well with that of the recombinant human bip. these data support the notion that
the 78 kda sa binding protein purified from human
fibroblasts is bip. bip is an abundant cellular protein
in fibroblasts, and its 103-fold purification through
four steps of chromatography raised concern about
whether bip is a high-capacity low-affinity sa binding
protein; a low-capacity high-affinity binding protein
may be the true target of salicylate action. that only
a single class of binding was detected by kinetic
analysis of crude cellular lysates would argue against
the presence of a high-affinity binding protein. in its
presence, the binding kinetics would exhibit more
than a single class of binding. the relatively low
affinity of sa binding to bip (kd ⬃50 ␮m) is therapeutically relevant, as aspirin or other salicylates
achieve their therapeutic effect at a concentration
close to the dissociation constant of sa binding to
bip. sa could bind to an isoform of bip protein
whose nh2-terminal sequence and molecular weight
are close to the authentic bip. however, we consider
this unlikely because bip is encoded by a single gene
copy and there are no reported data or functional
implication of the existence of bip isoforms. in our
final purification step, a minor 56 kda protein was
2467

protein folding, and an eventual replacement of adp
by atp resulting in rapid dissociation of the properly
folded proteins from bip (30). thus, polypeptide
binding to bip is a pivotal step in bip chaperone
function. based on a computer scoring system verified by experimental data, it has been demonstrated
that bip binds to proteins with heptameric motifs
consisting of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acid
residue (31–33). several such motifs were reported in
the hiv  xxxg706xxx  protein (26). to determine whether
sa binds to the peptide binding site, we chose an
active heptapeptide (kywwnll) and a control heptapeptide (twfnstw) from the reported  xxxg706xxx 
sequence (26). we confirmed that the active peptide
increased atpase activity, an indication of active
peptide binding, whereas the control peptide did not
have a significant effect on atpase activity. that the
active peptide competed with [14c]sa binding in a
concentration-dependent manner is consistent with
binding of sa to the peptide binding site of bip. this
is further confirmed by inhibition of peptide-stimu-

also detected to have sa binding activity. its identity
is unclear at this time. as binding kinetics of crude
extracts fits a single class of binding site for sa, it is
unlikely that this 56 kda protein plays a major part in
sa binding.
bip (also known as  xxxg1101xxx ) is an er resident
protein. it belongs to the heat shock protein 70
(hsp70) family and the glucose-regulated protein
family with important chaperone functions (28). a
major activity of bip is binding of newly synthesized
polypeptides, allowing appropriate protein folding
and transport across the membrane (27, 30). these
complex actions are executed by coordinated biochemical reactions including rapid binding of
polypeptides by atp-bound bip, activation of atpase, which converts atp to adp, slow dissociation of
polypeptide in adp-bound bip to allow for proper

lated atpase activity by sa but not an inactive
benzoate derivative.
binding of sa to the peptide binding site of bip
may interfere with appropriate protein folding,
which may in turn cause a condition resembling er
distress. a consequence of er stress is the feedback
up-regulation of bip expression (28). however, we
did not find increased bip protein levels in hff
treated with  xxxd3219xxx  even at high concentrations. nor did we observe the expression of
chop, another molecule induced by er stress (29),
in hff after salicylate treatment. these data suggest
that binding of sa to bip does not cause global er
stress as seen in glucose starvation. salicylate binding
to bip could cause inhibition of protein synthesis, as
sa has been shown to inhibit protein synthesis (34).
however, the concentrations of  xxxd3219xxx 
that suppress global proteins synthesis were much
higher than the kd value for salicylate binding to bip.
sa at pharmacological concentrations could interfere with synthesis of a selective group of proteins

that are highly dependent on bip for folding and
transport. there is little information about the proteins whose synthesis and function are significantly
altered by salicylate binding to bip. a recent report
that salicylate at therapeutic concentration inhibits
p70/p85 s6 kinase activity (35) may provide a clue.
p70/p85 s6 kinase targets cellular proteins, including c/ebp␤, for phosphorylation (36). since salicylate suppresses c/ebp␤ binding to cox-2 promoter
region, thereby inhibiting cox-2 promoter activity
(15, 16), it may be speculated that through its
binding to bip, salicylate may perturb a protein
involved in activation of p70/p85 s6 kinase. our
results show that aspirin is as potent as sodium
salicylate in inhibiting [14c]sa binding to bip. this
is consistent with our earlier finding that aspirin
and  xxxd3219xxx  inhibit cox-2 transcription at
equivalent concentrations (15). evaluation of a series of sa metabolites and analogs suggests that
the oh group at position 2 of  xxxd306xxx  appears
to be crucial for bip binding and inhibition of

sa (1–20 mm) and its analogs did not alter bip
