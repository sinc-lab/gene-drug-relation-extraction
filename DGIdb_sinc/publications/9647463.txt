an intronless open reading frame encoding a protein (361aa in length) was isolated from a rat genomic
library probed with a dna fragment from rat heart. this protein showed 83% sequence identity with
the human p2y4 (hp2y4) receptor and represents a homologue of the human pyrimidinoceptor.
however, the rp2y4 receptor is not selective for uridine nucleotides and, instead, shows an agonist
potency order of itp=atp=adp(pure)=utp=atpgs=2-mesatp=ap4a4udp(pure). adp,
atpgs, 2-mesatp and udp are partial agonists. thus, in terms of agonist pro®le, rp2y4 is more
like the  xxxg1646xxx  receptor subtype. the rp2y4 receptor was reversibly antagonized by reactive blue 2 but not
by  xxxd3266xxx  which, otherwise, inhibits the hp2y2 receptor (a known  xxxg1646xxx  receptor). thus, rp2y4 and the
 xxxg1646xxx  subtype appear to be structurally distinct forms of the  xxxg1646xxx  receptor (where atp and utp are
equi-active) but can be distinguished as  xxxd3266xxx -insensitive and  xxxd3266xxx -sensitive  xxxg1646xxx  receptors,
respectively.

introduction the human p2y4 (hp2y4) receptor is selective
for pyrimidine-based nucleotides (i.e., utp and udp) while
purine-based nucleotides (e.g., atp, adp and itp) are either
weak partial agonists (communi et al., 1995) or seemingly
inert (nguyen et al., 1995). accordingly, the view has been
expressed (communi & boeynaems, 1997) that hp2y4
represents an example of the utp-selective pyrimidinoceptor
®rst proposed by seifert & schultz (1989). hp2y4 receptor-like
transcripts have been found in rat neonatal cardiac ®broblasts
and cardiac myocytes (webb et al., 1996). neither the sequence
nor the pharmacological pro®le for this rat p2y4 (rp2y4)
receptor has been identi®ed. here, we present data on the
isolation, protein sequence and pharmacological properties of
the rat homologue of hp2y4.
methods total rna was isolated from rat heart (spraguedawley, killed by co2 inhalation) and cdna was synthesized
using an oligo(dt)-primer and superscript reverse transcriptase (gibco brl, u.k.). one cdna fragment was 83%
homologous to the previously identi®ed cdna of the hp2y4
receptor and was used to screen a rat genomic library
(clontech). the subsequent rp2y4 clone was puri®ed and
subcloned in the prn3.lin transcription vector. defolliculated
xenopus oocytes were injected cytosolically with rat p2y4
crna (40 nl, 1 mg ml71), incubated for 48 h at 188c in
barth's solution and kept for up to 7 days at 48c before the
electrophysiological experiments. nucleotide-evoked membrane currents (icl,ca) were recorded from crna-injected
oocytes using the twin-electrode voltage-clamp technique.
oocytes were superfused with a ringer solution (5 ml min71,
at 188c) containing (mm): nacl2 110, kcl 2.5, hepes 5,
cacl2 1.8, adjusted to ph 7.5. nucleotides added to the
superfusate were applied for 120 s or until currents reached a
peak, then washed o with ringer solution for 60 ± 90 min.

nucleotide responses were normalized to the maximum
current (imax) evoked by utp (100 mm). the concentration
that evoked 50% of this maximum response (ec50) was taken
from hill plots. the amount of contaminating atp in adp
stocks was determined by the method of bioluminescence,
using the conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin catalyzed by
®re¯y luciferase. contaminating atp was removed from adp
stocks by adding hexokinase (50 u ml71) and glucose (25 mm)
for 2 h before the assays (see lazarowski et al., 1997). udp
solutions were treated with hexokinase (250 u ml71) and
glucose (25 mm) to remove utp. p2 antagonists were added
to the superfusate in cumulative concentrations, each
concentration being applied 60 min before the addition of
submaximal concentrations (ec70) of utp. the antagonist
concentration that reduced utp-responses by 50% (ic50) was
taken from inhibition curves.
results rt-pcr was used to amplify p2y-like sequences
from total rna isolated from the rat heart. a dna fragment
was isolated, subcloned into the pcr2.1 vector and 20
independent clones were subjected to partial sequencing
analysis. one clone was puri®ed, labelled to high speci®c
activity and used to screen 106 independent clones of a rat
genomic library. a genomic clone (rp2y4) was puri®ed and
subjected to detailed restriction and hybridization analysis. an
intronless open reading frame of 1083bp encoded a protein of
361 amino acids (figure 1). hydropathy analysis of the
predicted rp2y4 receptor protein revealed the presence of seven
transmembrane spanning domains. rp2y4 was closely related
to the human homologue hp2y4 (83% identical at the amino
acid level) and less related to rp2y2 (51%). a comparison of
the amino acid sequences of rp2y4, hp2y4 and rp2y2 is shown
(figure 1).
both atp (ec50, 1.8+0.2 mm; slope, 0.9+0.11; n=5) and
utp (ec50, 2.6+0.4 mm, slope, 0.9+0.05; n=5) were equiactive and equi-potent agonists at the recombinant rp2y4
receptor (figure 2a). atp and utp caused cross-desensitization at the rp2y4 receptor when superfused successively (each

at 3 mm, for 120 s). membrane currents to supramaximal
concentrations (100 mm) of atp and utp applied simultaneously were not additive. udp was approximately 3 fold less
potent (ec50, 6.3+1.7 mm; slope, 1.2+0.1; n=5) than atp
and utp, but gave maximal responses similar to these two
agonists. hexokinase pretreatment of udp stocks failed to
aect udp potency (ec50, 4.2+0.1 mm; n=4) but decreased
its maximal activity. thus, udp stocks were signi®cantly
contaminated with utp. the concentration-response curve for
adp was complex and ®tted best by a biphasic curve. the ®rst
phase (ec50, 0.67+0.08 mm; slope, 1.6+0.24; n=5) reached a
plateau at 25% maximal activity ( xxxd1891xxx  mm) while the second
phase (ec50, 127+27 mm; slope, 1.7+0.1; n=5) peaked at the
same maximal activity as atp and utp. measurement by the
luciferin-luciferase atp-assay revealed that the atp content
was 4.4+0.4% (n=4) of adp solutions. the second phase of
the adp curve was abolished after hexokinase treatment,
suggesting it was due to contamination of adp stocks by
atp. the ®rst phase of the adp-curve was displaced slightly
to the right by hexokinase treatment (ec50, 1.9+0.6 mm;
n=4). both itp (ec50, 1.4+0.5 mm; slope, 0.9+0.2; n=4) and
ap4a (ec50, 3.0+0.7 mm; slope, 0.8+0.1; n=4) were as potent
and active as atp and utp. both atpgs (ec50, 2.1+0.5 mm,
n=4) and 2-mesatp (ec50, 2.1+0.3 mm, n=4) were as
potent and active as adp after hexokinase treatment. the
potency order of agonists at rp2y4 was (by ec50 values):
itp = atp = adp(pure) = utp = atpgs = 2 - mesatp =
ap4a4udp(pure). however, adp, atpgs, 2-mesatp and
udp are partial agonists at rp2y4.

 xxxd3266xxx , ppads and reactive blue 2 (rb-2) (0.1 ± 100 mm)
were tested at rp2y44 against utp-mediated inward currents.
at 100 mm,  xxxd3266xxx  weakly antagonized (by *10%) utpresponses, ppads had no eect while rb-2 almost abolished
utp-responses (data not shown). the inhibitory action of rb2 was concentration-dependent and, in further experiments,
revealed an ic50 value of 21.1+2.9 mm (n=4) and slope of
0.8+0.1 (n=4) against utp-responses (figure 2b). the
blocking eect of rb-2 was reversed after washout (60 min).
discussion a clone isolated from a rat genomic library is
structurally related to the human p2y4 receptor gene and
mostly likely encodes the rat homologue. the predicted amino
acid sequences for the rp2y4 and hp2y4 receptors are highly
conserved (90%) over the seven hydrophobic (transmembrane
spanning) regions and cytoplasmic/extracellular loops but
show more diversity at the levels of the n- and c-termini
(overall sequence identity was 83%). n- and c-termini of p2y
receptors are unlikely to form the ligand binding domain and,
hence, unlikely to aect agonist selectivity (van rhee et al.,
1995). the agonist pro®le for rp2y4 expressed in xenopus
oocytes did not match the pro®le for hp2y4 but, instead, was
closer to the pro®le of rp2y2. the hp2y4 receptor shows a
marked preference for pyrimidine nucleotides (utp and udp)
and is weakly activated (if at all) by purine nucleotides
(nguyen et al., 1995; communi et al., 1995). the rp2y2
receptor shows no such preference and is stimulated equally by
atp and utp, as well as by atpgs, itp and diadenosine

tetraphosphate (ap4a) (chen et al., 1996; filippov et al.,
1997). these nucleotides, except for atpgs, were potent full
agonists of rp2y4 and, accordingly, this new clone is virtually
indistinguishable from rp2y2 on the basis of agonist activity.
another new clone isolated from a turkey blood cdna library
(boyer et al., 1997) is also related to hp2y4 (56%) yet has an
agonist pro®le (atp=utp4ap4a4atpgs4udp) similar
to the pro®le of rp2y4 shown here.
rp2y4 showed a preference for the p2 receptor antagonist
reactive blue 2 (rb-2) but was only slightly inhibited by
 xxxd3266xxx  (at 100 mm). this antagonist pro®le (rb-244suramin,  xxxd3047xxx -6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid
(ppads) inactive) for rp2y4 did not match the ranking
activity of these substances at hp2y4 receptors where only
ppads (30 mm and greater) signi®cantly inhibits while rb-2 is

a weak antagonist (communi et al., 1996). charlton et al.
(1996) has shown that  xxxd3266xxx  (pa2=5.77) is more eective
than ppads (pa2=4.32) at hp2y2 receptors. thus, rp2y4 and
hp2y2 represent two functional types of the  xxxg1646xxx  receptor
which, respectively, are  xxxd3266xxx -insensitive and suraminsensitive. it is interesting that  xxxg1646xxx  receptors in vascular
tissues can be subdivided into two subpopulations on the basis
of  xxxd3266xxx  sensitivity (dainty et al., 1994).
