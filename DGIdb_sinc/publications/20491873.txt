summary
purpose: activation of ionotropic c- xxxd2177xxx 
type a (gabaa) receptors induces in immature neocortical neurons a membrane depolarization that may contribute to the higher epilepsy susceptibility in newborns. to
elucidate whether depolarizing gabaergic responses
enhance or attenuate epileptiform activity in the immature neocortex, we investigated the effect of agonists,
antagonists, and positive modulators of gabaa receptors
on epileptiform activity.
methods: we performed in vitro field potential recordings on isolated whole neocortex preparations and whole
cell recordings of identified pyramidal neurons in 400-lm
slices of immature (postnatal day 1–7) mice. epileptiform
activity was induced by low mg2+ solutions with or without
50–100 lm  xxxd1804xxx .
results: bath application of gaba (3–100 lm, in the presence of tiagabine) attenuated epileptiform activity. the

epileptic seizures are a major neurologic disorder affecting about 1% of the population (blume, 2003). interestingly, seizure frequency is higher in children than in adults
(glauser, 1995; cowan, 2002). the majority of seizures in
children have a symptomatic origin—like fever (nelson &
ellenberg, 1976) or asphyxia (finer et al., 1981)—and may
interfere with cognitive development. human and animal
studies clearly identified early seizures as one risk factor for
the manifestation of epilepsy (holmes, 1997; khalilov
et al., 2003). in addition to other factors, the depolarizing
membrane responses mediated by gabaa receptors in
immature neurons of the hippocampus (e.g., ben-ari et al.,
1989; lamsa et al., 2000) and the neocortex (luhmann &
prince, 1991; owens et al., 1996) have been associated with

gaba transporter isoform 1 ( xxxg2143xxx ) inhibitor tiagabine
(30 lm) and the  xxxg2146xxx /3 specific inhibitor snap 5114
(40 lm) reduced the frequency of epileptiform activity.
the benzodiazepines midazolam (0.2 lm) and zolpidem
(0.5 lm) as well as the barbiturate phenobarbital (30 lm)
slightly attenuated epileptiform activity. continuous bath
application of the gabaergic antagonist gabazine
(sr-95531, 2–3 lm) or  xxxd2947xxx  (15 lm) induced epileptiform discharges.
discussion: these results demonstrate, that (1) the activation or positive modulation of gabaa receptors attenuates epileptiform activity, (2) gabaa antagonists
mediate a disinhibition, and (3) gaba uptake contributes
to the regulation of extracellular gaba in immature neocortex. we conclude from these findings that a constant
inhibition via gabaa receptors is required to suppress
epileptiform activity already in the immature neocortex.

the higher seizure susceptibility of immature central nervous systems (ben ari et al., 2007). these depolarizing
gabaergic responses are most likely caused by an
increased intracellular cl) concentration due to an altered
membrane cl) transport (rivera et al., 1999; yamada et al.,
2004; achilles et al., 2007). therefore, gaba contributes
to excitation in immature hippocampus (ben-ari et al.,
1989; sipila et al., 2005) and neocortex (owens et al.,
1996; achilles et al., 2007).
in agreement with this excitatory action of gaba, some
studies in the immature hippocampus showed that depolarizing gaba responses contribute to the generation of epileptiform activity (dzhala & staley, 2003; dzhala et al.,
2008). however, other studies demonstrated that inhibition
of gabaa receptors induces epileptiform activity (khalilov et al., 1997; lamsa et al., 2000; wells et al., 2000;
khazipov et al., 2004; kilb et al., 2007), suggesting an
inhibitory influence of gaba already in the newborn
rodent hippocampus. in contrast, information about the
effect of gabaa receptors on epileptiform activity in
immature neocortex is sparse and controversial. although

d. richter et al.
one study demonstrated that gaba antagonists induce epileptiform activity in neocortical slices of newborn mice
(wells et al., 2000), a recent report indicates that excitatory
gabaergic responses contribute to the generation of epileptiform activity in subgranular layers of the developing
cortex (rheims et al., 2008). detailed knowledge about
gabaergic functions in various brain areas during
development is essential to evaluate therapeutic capacities
and limitations of antiepileptic drugs that interact with the
gabaergic system in premature infants and neonates.
to investigate whether gabaa receptors inhibit or facilitate epileptiform activity in the immature neocortex, we
examined the effect of gabaa agonists, antagonists, and
modulators on epileptiform activity in whole neocortex
preparations and neocortical slices from immature (postnatal day 1–7) mice using extracellular field potential and
whole-cell recordings in slice preparations. we observed
that gabaergic antagonists provoked epileptiform activity,
whereas agonists and positive modulators of gabaa receptors attenuated epileptiform activity, suggesting that an
intrinsic activation of gabaa receptors suppresses epileptiform activity in immature neocortex.

materials and methods
preparation
all experiments were conducted in accordance with eu
directive 86/609/eec for the use of animals in research
and were approved by the local ethical committee (landesuntersuchungsanstalt rlp, koblenz, germany). c57bl/6
mouse pups of postnatal days 1–7 (p1-7, with the day of
birth as p0) were obtained from the local breeding facility.
preparation of isolated cortices was performed as described
in detail before (dupont et al., 2006), using a modified technique. animals were deeply anesthetized by  xxxd1993xxx 
( xxxd1993xxx , abbot, wiesbaden, germany) and decapitated.
isolated brains were immersed for 2–3 min in ice-cold standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) and were glued
with their caudal section on a spatula for easier handling.
the leptomeninges were stripped off, hemispheres were dissected, and all subcortical structures and the hippocampus
were removed from the cortical preparations. isolated cortices were transferred to an interface-type recording chamber where they were continuously superfused with acsf at
a rate of 7–9 ml per min at 31 € 1c. cortices were allowed
to recover for at least 1 h under these conditions. field
potential recordings showed rather stable postsynaptic
responses and epileptiform activity within a 6 h interval,
indicating the viability of this preparation in vitro (fig.
 xxxd3227xxx ,b). in addition, histochemical staining revealed no
signs of structural and functional disintegration in the isolated cortices after 6 h in vitro (fig. s1c,d). for preparation of coronal slices, isolated mice brains were glued on the
fixed stage of a vibratome (hr2, sigmann elektronik,
hffenhardt, germany), and 400-lm thick slices were

sectioned and subsequently stored in acsf for at least 1 h
before the experiment.
data acquisition and analysis
extracellular field potentials were recorded with tungsten
microelectrodes (impedance 4–5 mx; fhc, bowdoinham,
me, u.s.a.) placed in parietal cortical areas. signals were
amplified using ext10-2f amplifiers (npi, tamm,
germany), low-pass filtered at 3 khz, and stored on a pc
using an ad/da board (itc-16; heka, lamprecht,
german) and tida 4.11 software (heka). extracellular
field potentials were recorded simultaneously from maximally four separate cortices. preparations that did not
respond with epileptiform activity upon the application of
50–100 lm  xxxd1804xxx  in low-mg2+ solution were discarded from
analysis. all recordings were analyzed using the program
minianalysis 4.3.3 (synaptosoft, leonia, nj, u.s.a.).
epileptiform discharges were identified according to their
amplitude and shape by the minianalysis program, verified
by visual inspection, and analyzed with respect to amplitude, frequency (calculated from interevent intervals), and
duration. whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed as described previously (achilles et al., 2007) at
32 € 1c in a submerged-type recording chamber attached
to the fixed stage of a microscope (axioskop ii, zeiss,
gçttingen, germany). pyramidal neurons were identified
by their location and morphologic appearance in infrared
differential interference contrast image. patch-pipettes
(5–12 mx) were filled with pipette solution containing
86 k-gluconate, 44 kcl, 1 cacl2, 2 mgcl2, 11 ethylene
glycol tetraacetic acid (egta), 10 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid (hepes), 2 na2-atp, 0.5
na-gtp (ph adjusted to 7.4 with koh and osmolarity to
306 mosm with sucrose). potentials were corrected for
liquid-junction potentials of 9.1 mv. signals were recorded
with a discontinuous voltage-clamp/current-clamp amplifier (sec05l; npi). focal gaba pulses were applied via a
patch pipette for 2–10 ms with a pressure of 0.4 bar using a
pressure application system (lhda0533115h; lee, westbrook, ct, u.s.a.). values are given as mean € standard
error of the mean (sem). for statistical analysis wilcoxon,
kruskal-wallis, and fisher’s exact tests were used (systat
11, point richmond, ca, u.s.a.). significance was
assigned at p-levels of 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**), and 0.001 (***).
solutions and drugs
solutions were prepared from 10· concentrated stock
solutions and were equilibrated with 95% o2/5% co2 at
least 1 h before use. standard acsf consisted of 126 nacl,
26 nahco3, 1.25 nah2po5, 1 mgcl2, 2 cacl2, 2.5 kcl,
and 10 glucose (ph 7.4, osmolarity 306 mosm). in lowmg2+ solutions mgcl2 was replaced by 1 mm cacl2.

 xxxd2947xxx , phenobarbital, and snap 5114 were purchased
from sigma (taufkirchen, germany); midazolam from
braun (melsungen, germany); and all other substances
from merck (darmstadt, germany).  xxxd1804xxx ,  xxxd2947xxx ,
gabazine, tiagabine, snap-5114, and zolpidem were
dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, gaba in distilled water,
and midazolam in 0.9% nacl. all substances were added to
the solutions shortly before the experiment. the dimethyl
sulfoxide (dmso) concentration of the final solution never
exceeds 0.2%.

properties of epileptiform activity
bath application of 50 lm  xxxd1804xxx  induced epileptiform
activity in only one of 19 cortices. low-mg2+ solution
induced spontaneous epileptiform events with a frequency
of 0.02 € 0.01 hz (n = 18) in 18 of 25 cortices (fig. 1a).
epileptiform activity consisted either of single discharges
with a duration of 573 € 94 ms (n = 8) or of trains of
7.7 € 1.3 discharges (n = 10) occurring at a frequency of
0.28 € 0.03 hz (fig. 1b). the addition of  xxxd1804xxx  to lowmg2+ solution massively enhanced epileptiform activity. in
the presence of 50–100 lm  xxxd1804xxx  under low-mg2+ conditions, repetitive epileptiform activity was observed
(fig. 1c). in the majority of the experiments (154 of 157
cortices) this epileptiform activity consisted of single

discharges with a mean duration of 504 € 17 ms (fig. 1d).
discharges appeared at frequencies between 0.02 and
0.76 hz (mean 0.22 € 0.01 hz, n = 157). because the uniform continuous epileptiform activity induced by 50 lm
 xxxd1804xxx /low-mg2+ allows the identification of minor changes
in the excitability of the cortex, we used this model mainly
for the subsequent experiments. bath application of 10 lm
cnqx significantly reduced the frequency of low-mg2+ –
and  xxxd1804xxx /low-mg2+-induced epileptiform discharges by
42.5 € 8.8% (n = 14) and 23.3 € 6.5% (n = 17), respectively (fig. 1e). both low-mg2+-induced (n = 15) and
 xxxd1804xxx /low mg2+-induced epileptiform activity (n = 15) were
abolished by 60 lm dl-apv.
whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in cortical pyramidal neurons revealed that bath application of 50 lm  xxxd1804xxx  in
low-mg2+ solutions induced paroxysmal depolarization
shifts. under this condition spontaneous depolarizations of
31.5 € 0.9 mv (n = 6 cells) occurred at a frequency of
0.05 € 0.005 hz (fig. 1f). these paroxysmal depolarization shifts had a mean duration of 2.9 € 0.1 s and induced
on average 18 € 1.7 action potentials (fig. 1g).
gabaa agonists inhibit epileptiform activity
to address the question of whether gabaa receptors
mediate an inhibitory or excitatory influence, we investigated the effects of gabaergic agonists on  xxxd1804xxx /lowmg2+-induced epileptiform activity in the whole neocortex

preparation of p1-7 mice pups. because gaba uptake may
suppress an effect of exogenously provided gaba,
we applied gaba in the presence of tiagabine, a blocker of
 xxxg2143xxx  (dalby, 2000). application of 30 lm tiagabine significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the frequency of epileptiform
activity by 8.9 € 2.7% (fig. 2a,b) and the duration by
10.6 € 2.4% (n = 65) but had no significant effect on the
amplitude (95.1 € 2%). the effect of 30 lm tiagabine on
the frequency and duration of epileptiform activity showed
no significant (p = 0.661 and 0.073, respectively) dependence on the postnatal age (fig. 2b). in 30 lm tiagabine a
significantly (p = 0.0191 and 0.0025, respectively) stronger
reduction in discharge frequency was induced by bath application of 10 and 100 lm gaba (fig. 2c,d). application of
40 lm snap-5114, a blocker of  xxxg2146xxx /3 gaba transporters (keros & hablitz, 2005), had no significant effect on the
amplitude of epileptiform activity, but slightly reduced the
frequency by 4.9 € 2.1% (n = 22, p = 0.014, fig. 2e). the
effect of bath-applied gaba (10 and 100 lm) on discharge
frequency was not significantly altered in the presence of
40 lm snap-5114 (fig. 2e).
bath application of gaba in the presence of 30 lm
tiagabine showed a dose-dependent suppressive effect on
 xxxd1804xxx /low-mg2+-induced epileptiform activity. while 1 lm
gaba had no significant effect (p = 0.588) and 3–100 lm
gaba significantly reduced the frequency of epileptiform

activity (fig. 3a,b). the attenuating effect of gaba
remained stable during an interval of 15 min (fig. s2a,b).
bath application of higher gaba doses (10–100 lm)
efficiently attenuated epileptiform activity in all age groups
studied (fig. 3c), without a significant difference between
the age groups (p > 0.105). a statistically significant
(p = 0.019) age-dependent difference was observed for
3 lm gaba only. this gaba concentration significantly
reduced the frequency of epileptiform activity in cortices
from p1-4 but not from p5-7 animals (fig. 3c,d), suggesting a slight shift in gaba affinity within this developmental period. the duration of epileptiform discharge was not
significantly affected by bath application of gaba. wholecell patch-clamp experiments revealed that bath application
of gaba reduced the input resistance of cortical pyramidal
neurons in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 3e,f), suggesting
that a shunting effect of higher gaba concentrations may
mediate the gabaergic attenuation of epileptiform activity. on the other hand, bath-applied gaba reduced the
amplitude of inward currents induced by a focal pressure
application of 100 lm gaba, suggesting receptor desensitization (fig. 3g,h). in summary, these results demonstrate
that activation of gabaa receptors attenuates  xxxd1804xxx /
low-mg2+-induced epileptiform activity independent of the
postnatal age, suggesting an inhibitory action of gabaa
receptors on epileptiform activity.

(n = 9, fig. 4a). bath application of 10 lm gaba in the
presence of 30 lm tiagabine significantly reduced the frequency of epileptiform activity by 50 € 9.7% (n = 9,
fig. 4b,c), whereas 100 lm gaba reduced the frequency
by 74.1 € 9.6% (n = 7). in summary, these results demonstrate that gaba attenuates epileptiform activity also in the
low-mg2+ model.
gaba antagonists induce epileptiform activity
in immature neocortex
the previous experiments demonstrate that gaba, either
exogenously applied or at enhanced extracellular concentrations due to gaba uptake blockade, can attenuate epileptiform activity. however, gaba-mediated responses may be
altered under conditions with repetitive epileptiform discharges. in order to elucidate whether gaba mediates an
inhibitory influence on the immature neocortex in the
absence of excessive neuronal activity, we next investigated
the effect of gabaa receptor antagonists.
the specific gabaa antagonist gabazine (3 lm) induced
epileptiform discharges in 31 of 44 investigated cortices
(fig. 5a) these epileptiform discharges appeared
6.2 € 1.7 min after application with a low frequency of

and showed a similar appearance as the epileptiform disepilepsia, 51(8):1483–1492, 2010

charges induced by  xxxd1804xxx /low-mg2+ conditions (fig. 5b).
neither the incidence nor the frequency or duration of
epileptiform activity showed a significant dependency on
the postnatal age (fig. 5c,d). similar results were obtained
with the gaba antagonist  xxxd2947xxx  (15 lm), which
induced eileptiform discharges (in 14 of 17 cortices) that
started 18.1 € 1.9 min after  xxxd2947xxx  application, had a
duration of 382 € 57 ms, and occured at a frequency of
0.015 € 0.002. in summary, these results show that a continuous activation of gabaa receptors is required to suppress epileptiform discharges in the immature neocortex.
role of tonic gabaergic inhibition
because our previous experiments suggested that a continuous inhibitory action of gaba is required to suppress
epileptiform activity, we next tried to identify whether tonic
gabaergic responses contribute to the inhibitory effect. to
analyze tonic gabaergic components we evaluated the
effect of the benzodiazepines midazolam and zolpidem,
which specifically enhance tonic currents at low concentrations (sipila et al., 2007). application of 0.2 lm midazolam
significantly (p = 0.0096) reduced the amplitude of  xxxd1804xxx /
low-mg2+-induced epileptiform discharges to 83.7 € 5.8%

effect on frequency or amplitude and did not alter phenobarbital efficacy.

(n = 15; fig. 6a), but had no effect on the frequency
(98.7 € 3.1%) and duration (91.3 € 8.1%). application of
0.5 lm zolpidem induced a significant (p = 0.0076) reduction in amplitude to 82.7 € 5.1% (n = 11), but had no effect
on the frequency (105 € 5.1%) and duration (108 € 9.5%)
of epileptiform discharges. the effect of midazolam and zolpidem were stable throughout the application interval. in
summary, these results suggest that the enhancement of
tonic gabaergic currents attenuate epileptiform activity in
the immature neocortex. in addition, we tested the effect of
the barbiturate phenobarbital, since this drug is used as standard therapy for neonatal seizures (wheless et al., 2007).
these experiments revealed that 30 lm phenobarbital
slightly reduced the amplitude of epileptiform activity by
4.7 € 2.1% (n = 27, p = 0.004) and had no significant
effect on the frequency (104 € 3.5%) and duration
(96.8 € 2.4%; fig. 6b,c). no evidence for a transient effect
of phenobarbital was observed during the application

(fig. s2c). because bumetanide enhances the phenobarbital efficacy in the immature hippocampus (dzhala et al.,
2008), we also tested this substance. in the whole cortex
preparation the effect of 30 lm phenobarbital was not
significantly altered in the presence of 10 lm bumetanide
(fig. 6c). in the presence of bumetanide and phenobarbital,
the amplitude of epileptiform discharges amounted to
97 € 3.6%, (n = 10), the frequency to 97 € 4.2%, and the
duration to 103 € 2.8% of the values observed in the presence of bumetanide alone. bath application of 10 lm
bumetanide affected neither amplitude (100 € 4.1%,
n = 18) nor frequency (103 € 2.8%) or duration (101 €
2.2%) of epileptiform discharges (fig. 6c).

discussion
in the present study we demonstrate that (1) the activation
of gabaa receptors reduces epileptiform activity, (2) the
application of the gabaa antagonists gabazine and  xxxd2947xxx  induces epileptiform discharges, and (3) low concentrations of the positive gabaa receptor modulators
midazolam, zolpidem, and phenobarbital slightly reduce
epileptiform activity. in summary, these results suggest that
in the immature neocortex an activation of gabaa receptors can attenuate epileptiform activity and that a persistent
intrinsic activation of gabaa receptors is required to
suppress epileptiform activity.
although depolarizing and excitatory effects of gaba
have been reported for the immature neocortex (luhmann
& prince, 1991; owens et al., 1996; achilles et al., 2007;
rheims et al., 2008), the results of our present study demonstrate that gaba can mediate an inhibitory action in immature neocortex. after inhibition of endogenous gaba
uptake mechanisms low concentrations of gaba reduced
the frequency of epileptiform discharges in low-mg2+ or
low-mg2+/50 lm 4ap extracellular solutions. these findings indicate that gaba can have an inhibitory action on
epileptiform activity. the attenuation of epileptiform activity by gaba at concentrations above 10 lm showed no significant difference between different postnatal ages within
the first postnatal week, suggesting that gaba can mediate
comparable inhibitory actions throughout the postnatal ages
tested. in accordance with a previous report (wells et al.,
2000), we also show that inhibition of gabaa receptors
induces epileptiform activity in the immature mouse neocortex. we conclude from these findings that blockade of
gabaa receptors leads to a disinhibition of intracortical
circuits. in the whole cortex preparation, gabazine induced
epileptiform activity in about 70% of the preparations
tested, which was substantially higher than the rates
reported previously for rodent cortical slices (wells et al.,
2000) and most probably reflects the higher preservation of
connectivity in the whole cortex preparation. finally, the
present study revealed that application of the positive
gabaergic modulators midazolam, zolpidem, and

phenobarbital slightly reduced the amplitude of epileptiform discharges. these findings do not only support the
hypothesis that gaba can potentially mediate inhibition,
but further suggest that endogenously released gaba acting on gabaa receptors contribute to such an inhibitory
effect under our experimental conditions. in summary, these
results demonstrate that a continuous intrinsic activation of
gabaa receptors is required to suppress epileptiform activity. such an inhibitory gabaa effect in the immature cortex has been previously suggested from the observations
that blockade of gabaa receptors increases excitability
and induces epileptiform activity in the neocortex (agmon
et al., 1996; wells et al., 2000). these findings, as well as
our results, are in striking contrast to a recent report by
rheims and coworkers (rheims et al., 2008), who found
that gabazine attenuates  xxxd1804xxx –induced epileptiform discharges in cortical slices of p6-9 swiss mice. this discrepancy may be result from the different epilepsy model used
or may reflect a strain difference. interestingly, gaba
reduced the frequency of epileptiform activity but had no
obvious effect on the amplitude. this observation may
reflect a decreased excitability and an unaltered potential to
synchronize during an epileptiform discharge, since there is
evidence in the literature that the frequency of epileptiform
activity is controlled by the excitatory drive (e.g. lcke
et al., 1996; kilb et al., 2006), whereas the amplitude coincides with the size of coactive neuronal assemblies and thus
represents the synchronization within an epileptic discharge
(bikson et al., 2003). in combination with recent publications our data suggest that the main effect of gabaergic
action is identical in the neocortex and hippocampus of
immature rodents. in both cortical structures inhibition of
gabaa receptors induces epileptiform activity (khalilov
et al., 1997; wells et al., 2000; lamsa et al., 2000; khazipov et al., 2004; kilb et al., 2007; but see dzhala & staley,
2003; rheims et al., 2008), despite the fact that gabaa
receptors can mediate excitatory responses in the cerebral
cortex and hippocampus.
a plausible explanation for the inhibitory effect of depolarizing gabaergic responses is that activation of gabaa
receptor does not only mediate a membrane depolarization
but decreases the membrane resistance, thus shunting excitatory inputs (staley & mody, 1992; khalilov et al., 1999;
lamsa et al., 2000). in whole-cell experiments we were able
to show that bath application of gaba induced a dosedependent reduction in the input resistance of cortical cells,
but also desensitized gabaa receptors. although these
results indicate that bath-applied gaba exerts a complex
effect on gabaergic transmission, the reduction in the
input resistance is in line with the assumption that depolarizing gaba responses can mediate inhibitory actions via
shunting inhibition. the observed desensitization of
gabaa receptors may contribute to the rather limited efficiency of bath-applied gaba to attenuate epileptiform
activity. whether the amount of gabaergic inhibition will

be increased in more mature cortices could not be investigated in the whole cortex preparation.
any intense activation of gabaa receptors will induce
massive cl) fluxes, thus decreasing intracellular cl) concentration and gabaergic depolarization (achilles et al.,
2007), which can shift gabaergic action to shunting inhibition. however, even with lower gaba concentrations
that may induce minor cl) fluxes, no evidence for an excitatory action was observed in our experiments. repetitive
epileptiform discharges may also cause a shift in the gaba
reversal potential, for example, by alterations in the setpoint
of cl)-transport (brumback & staley, 2008), thus promoting an inhibitory gabaergic action under this condition.
however, our finding that inhibition of gabaa receptors
induced epileptiform activity indicates that gabaa receptors mediate an inhibitory effect on the cortical excitability
under resting conditions.
an additional finding of our experiments is that application of the  xxxg2143xxx  specific inhibitor tiagabine (dalby, 2000)
or the  xxxg2146xxx /3 inhibitor snap-5114 (keros & hablitz,
2005) attenuates epileptiform activity in the immature neocortex, suggesting that both gaba transporters are
involved in the regulation of interstitial gaba. the expression of  xxxg2143xxx  (conti et al., 2004) and  xxxg2144xxx  (minelli
et al., 2003) in neurons and glial cells of the immature cortex has been demonstrated already.  xxxg2143xxx  controls epileptiform activity in the immature hippocampus (sabau et al.,
1999; sipila et al., 2007; but see quilichini et al., 2003),
but was without effect in the entorhinal cortex of p5-7 rat
pups (sabau et al., 1999). in the whole cortex preparation
tiagabine reduced the frequency of low-mg2+ induced
epileptiform activity by approximately 25%. although
a comparable frequency reduction was observed in
hippocampal slices under interface conditions (sabau
et al.,1999), tiagabine failed to reduce the frequency in the
whole hippocampus preparation (quilichini et al., 2003).
this discrepancy may be caused by the high perfusion rates
required to maintain in toto preparations, which can alter the
composition of the interstitial compartment. the antiepileptogenic efficacy of tiagabine, but also the amount of tonic
gabaa receptor activation, might, therefore, be underestimated in our experiments.
low concentrations of the benzodiazepines midazolam
and zolpidem have been used previously to selectively
enhance tonic gabaergic currents in the immature hippocampus (sipila et al., 2007). in the present study, we demonstrate that low concentrations of midazolam and
zolpidem slightly attenuate epileptiform activity also in the
immature neocortex. therefore, gabaa receptors sensitive
to low benzodiazepine concentrations may contribute to the
tonic inhibitory effect of gaba. this effect may be mediated by a1–3 and c2 subunits; however, not all possible subunit compositions have been investigated yet (hevers &
lddens, 1998). enhancement of gabaergic function by
the barbiturate phenobarbital in a therapeutically relevant

1491
gaba inhibits epileptic activity
concentration (30–100 lm) led to an obvious reduction in
the frequency of epileptiform discharges in the hippocampus (quilichini et al., 2003; dzhala et al., 2008), whereas
this substance was rather ineffective in the present study. in
contrast to the hippocampus, where the cl)-uptake blocker
bumetanide enhances the antiepileptic efficacy of phenobarbital (dzhala et al., 2008), bumetanide seems to have no
effect in the neocortex. these different effects probably
result from expression of gabaa receptors with a lower
barbiturate affinity (thompson et al., 1996) in the immature
neocortex. from the present and previous studies (sabau
et al., 1999; quilichini et al., 2003; dzhala et al., 2008) it is
obvious that modulators of gabaergic action like gaba
uptake blockers, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates, mediate
only a partial attenuation of epileptiform activity in the
immature cortex, which may explain the limited potential of
these substances in some cases of neonatal epilepsies. however, the observation that midazolam produces a stronger
effect than phenobarbital in the immature neocortex as well
as clinical evidence for an anticonvulsant effect of midazolam in phenobarbital resistant neonatal epilepsies (castro
conde et al., 2005), suggests that this substance is a therapeutic option in neonatal epilepsies.
in summary, our results confirm that gaba can mediate
an inhibitory action in the immature neocortex and that this
inhibition is required to suppress epileptiform activity. our
finding that gaba uptake blockers as well as positive modulators of gabaa receptors attenuate repetitive epileptiform activity suggests that antiepileptic drugs belonging
to these classes can be of clinical relevance in newborns
(castro conde et al., 2005).
