summary
objective familial glucocorticoid deficiency type i (fgd1) is a
rare form of primary adrenal insufficiency resulting from recessive
mutations in the  xxxg1385xxx  ( xxxg1385xxx ,  xxxg1385xxx ). individuals with
this condition typically present in infancy or childhood with signs
and symptoms of cortisol insufficiency, but disturbances in the
renin-angiotensin system, aldosterone synthesis or sodium homeostasis are not a well-documented association of fgd1. as acth
stimulation has been shown to stimulate aldosterone release in
normal controls, and other causes of hyponatraemia can occur in
children with cortisol deficiency, we investigated whether  xxxg1385xxx 
changes might be identified in children with primary adrenal failure
who were being treated for mineralocorticoid insufficiency.

introduction
familial glucocorticoid deficiency type 1 (fgd1) (mim: 202200) is
an autosomal recessive acth–resistance syndrome resulting from
mutations in the  xxxg1385xxx  ( xxxg1385xxx ,  xxxg1385xxx 
[mim: 607397]).1,2 the molecular basis of this condition was first
described in 1993 and, to date, approximately 20 different  xxxg1385xxx 
mutations have been reported in around 40 individuals or families
with fgd1·3–11 the majority of  xxxg1385xxx  mutations are homozygous
or compound heterozygous missense mutations that impair the
function of this  xxxg89xxx  to varying degrees.10,11
to our knowledge, homozygous frameshift or nonsense mutations
in  xxxg1385xxx  have not been described previously.
children with fgd1 typically present with symptoms and signs
of glucocorticoid deficiency, such as prolonged jaundice, hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemic convulsions, failure to thrive, hyperpigmentation and sepsis.1,2 tall stature has also been reported in a
subset of individuals with fgd1, especially prior to glucocorticoid
treatment, but the pathogenic basis of this feature is not clear.6,12
disturbances in the renin-angiotensin system, mineralocorticoid
synthesis or sodium homeostasis are not a well-established feature
of this condition, and patients with classic fgd1 do not receive mineralocorticoid replacement. nevertheless, the  xxxg1385xxx  is expressed in
the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland, and acute administration
of acth(1–24) results in aldosterone release in normal human
volunteers.13–15 thus, a facilitative role for acth in supporting
mineralocorticoid synthesis may be physiologically important,
perhaps during stress or in early life – a time of relative mineralocorticoid insensitivity.16–19 furthermore, children with cortisol

deficiency may be volume depleted if unwell, or may be prone to
hyponatraemia due to reduced free-water clearance, which might be
interpreted as a salt-losing state in the acute clinical scenario.
here, we describe severe loss-of-function mutations in  xxxg1385xxx  in
seven children from three kindred, several of whom had evidence of
disturbed renin-sodium homeostasis and were receiving mineralocorticoid replacement. these children were originally thought to
have a recessive form of primary adrenal hypoplasia. thus, defining
the molecular basis of their condition has significant implications
for counselling, treatment and long-term prognosis.

methods
patients
a total of 22 individuals who had been diagnosed with likely
salt-losing forms of adrenal hypoplasia were included in the study.
of these, 19 were isolated cases and 3 were familial cases. in all cases,
mutations in the nuclear receptors  xxxg1594xxx  ( xxxg1594xxx ) and steroidogenic
factor 1 (sf1,  xxxg1604xxx ) had been excluded, as well as obvious steroid
biosynthetic defects, metabolic and autoimmune disorders affecting
adrenal function, and adrenal haemorrhage.

phosphatase (usb, cleveland, oh, usa) and then subjected to
direct sequencing using bigdye terminator version 1·1 (applied
biosystems, foster city, ca, usa) and a megabace1000tm capillary dna sequencer (amersham biosciences inc., little chalfont, uk). sequence analyser version 3·0 (amersham biosciences
inc.) and sequencher version 4·1 (genecodes corp., ann arbor, mi,
usa) were used to analyse the data.
plasma renin activity assays
plasma renin activity (pra) was measured using several different
independently validated assays over this 15-year study period,
and are expressed as pmol  xxxg99xxx /ml/h. in brief, pra was
measured in patient 1 by radioimmunoassay of  xxxg99xxx  using
a modification of an established method.20 sensitivity of the assay
was 0·3 ng/ml/h, intra-assay coefficient of variation was 4·9% and
interassay coefficient of variance was 6·5%. pra was measured in
kindred 2 by the technique reported by dillon et al.21 a commercial
radioimmunoassay (ria) (adaltis, casalecchio di reno, italy) was
used to measure pra in kindred 3.

 xxxg1385xxx . this change likely reduces ligand-binding affinity
and signal transduction, and has been shown to be associated with
marked loss of  xxxg1385xxx  function in previous in vitro studies using
y6 and os3 cells.10,11

fig. 1 patient 1 had low-normal aldosterone concentrations (upper panel)
and persistently elevated plasma renin activity (pra) (lower panel). the
steroid replacement regimen is shown above. shaded areas represent
age-adjusted normal ranges for each assay. recumbent measurements for
pra were taken after 2 years of age. conversion: pra, pmol/ml/h × 1·30

pra was elevated. she was started on hydrocortisone replacement
at relatively high doses (15–20 mg/m2/day) but had persistently
elevated pra and low aldosterone concentrations throughout early
childhood (fig. 1). consequently, 9alpha-fludrocortisone treatment was
started at 4 years of age, which resulted in a fall in renin activity.
mutational analysis revealed a homozygous s74i missense mutation
in  xxxg1385xxx  (fig. 2). this mutation converts a highly conserved serine

an older child had died at 18 months of age following a convulsion.
the proband (46,xy) presented with failure to thrive, hyperpigmentation and a hypoglycaemic convulsion at 19 months of age
in iran. cortisol was found to be low and he was started on methylprednisolone. at 21 months of age he was transferred for further
investigation. two days after stopping all treatment, there was no
cortisol increase following standard  xxxd1755xxx  stimulation and basal
pra was mildly elevated (table 1). serum 17- xxxd2303xxx 
(17-ohp) was not elevated. given these findings, he was diagnosed
as having adrenal hypoplasia and treated with hydrocortisone and
fludrocortisone throughout childhood. the fludrocortisone has
recently been stopped at the age of 14 and his pra has remained
within normal limits over 18 months.
his sister’s karyotype is 46,xx. she was investigated at 1 month
of age on account of the family history. she had a normal cortisol
response to standard  xxxd1755xxx  stimulation at one month of age
(peak 769 nmol/l), but became progressively pigmented throughout
the first year of life. investigations at 12 months of age showed absent
cortisol response to  xxxd1755xxx  stimulation and elevated acth. her
aldosterone was low but pra was not raised. almost simultaneously,
she developed a severe viral illness and became hyponatraemic
(sodium 129 mmol/l). she was started on hydrocortisone and
received fludrocortisone treatment transiently.
mutational analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations
(r146h/560delt) in  xxxg1385xxx  in both children (fig. 2). the r146h
change affects a highly conserved arginine in the second intracellular
loop of the receptor. this mutation has been reported previously

in a homozygous state in three patients, and was carried by the
mother. the arginine to histidine change likely affects the interaction
between the second cytoplasmic loop and fourth transmembrane
domain, resulting in severe loss of receptor function in y6 cells
through impaired g-protein coupling and ligand binding.10 the
second change is a single nucleotide deletion at position 560 (560delt)
resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon at amino acid
215. this novel change would be predicted to cause complete loss
of receptor function, and was carried by the father.
kindred iii (579–581deltgt)
the third family is a highly consanguineous kindred from qatar.
four of 12 children born in three nuclear families have primary
adrenal failure. the proband (46,xy) presented at 60 days of age
with pigmentation and a hypoglycaemic convulsion (table 1). he
had an elevated pra, his aldosterone was inappropriately low, and
he had mild hyponatraemia/hyperkalaemia. thus, he was diagnosed
as having adrenal hypoplasia and treated with hydrocortisone and
fludrocortisone. the second child (46,xx) presented at 4 days of age
with a hypoglycaemic convulsion. she was hyperpigmented and
found to be profoundly hypocortisolaemic (< 14 nmol/l), and was
started on hydrocortisone alone. given the emerging family history,
two further children were diagnosed as likely affected on the first day
of life on account of marked hyperpigmentation and hypoglycaemia,
and hydrocortisone was started almost immediately. one child was
also commenced on fludrocortisone as it was believed this family had
an autosomal recessive form of adrenal hypoplasia, and that treatment should be started before the onset of a salt-losing crisis. thus,
in all three cases, treatment was commenced within the first four days
of life before disturbances in pra or salt balance would likely have
become manifest.
mutational analysis revealed a novel homozygous three-nucleotide
deletion (579 – 581deltgt) in all affected individuals. this deletion
results in a stop codon at position 193 (y193x) in the fifth transmembrane domain of the  xxxg1385xxx  (fig. 2). their parents are all
carriers of this mutation and siblings are either heterozygous or normal.

discussion
the clinical diagnosis of adrenal failure in infancy or childhood can
be challenging. affected individuals often have an insidious clinical
course, and symptoms and signs can be nonspecific or subtle. hyperpigmentation is often overlooked, and when a child presents collapsed
or with a hypoglycaemic convulsion, life-saving treatment must be
administered.
when the child has marked hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, inappropriately high urinary sodium excretion and a reduced circulating
volume, the diagnosis of salt-losing primary adrenal failure is usually
clear. such salt-losing forms of adrenal insufficiency causing combined glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid insufficiency can occur in
several well-defined conditions, such as defects in steroidogenesis
(e.g. steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (star),  xxxg570xxx ,  xxxg1096xxx ,
 xxxg579xxx ), following adrenal destruction (e.g. haemorrhage, adrenoleukodystrophy, autoimmune), or with forms of congenital adrenal
hypoplasia (e.g. x-linked ( xxxg1594xxx ),  xxxg1604xxx , image).22,23

however, if biochemical findings are subtle (e.g. mild hyponatraemia with borderline high potassium), or if the child has
already received fluid resuscitation and steroid treatment, dissecting
out the exact biochemical nature of the condition at a later date can
be difficult.
the association of salt-losing states or apparent mineralocorticoid
insufficiency with forms of familial glucocorticoid deficiency/acth
resistance syndromes is less clear. spark et al. reported an impaired
aldosterone response to acth stimulation in a patient with fgd,
but the molecular diagnosis is not reported.24 furthermore, this
patient presented in childhood with isolated glucocorticoid insufficiency, no clinical disturbances in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
pathway were ever detected, and an impairment of aldosterone
response to acth stimulation was only evident in the recumbent
setting when the individual was assessed in early adulthood. in
addition, davidai et al. described mild disturbances in the reninangiotensin system in a patient with fgd.25 however, a  xxxg1385xxx 
mutation causing fgd1 in this individual has now been excluded
(z. hochberg, personal communication). thus, although it is known
that approximately 10–15% of individuals who have acth resistance
as part of the triple a (allgrove) syndrome (aaas, aladin)
(omim: 231550) do have evidence of mineralocorticoid deficiency,26
disturbances in renin-sodium homeostasis in patients with other
acth-resistance syndromes (fgd1 due to  xxxg1385xxx  mutations; fgd2
due to mutations in mrap [607398]) are not well established.27
in normal physiological states,  xxxg99xxx  is the major drive
to mineralocorticoid production. however, the  xxxg1385xxx  is
expressed in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland, and acute
administration of  xxxd1755xxx  to normal individuals produces a rapid
and dose-dependent rise in serum aldosterone.13–15 thus, acth
may have an important facilitative role stimulating mineralocorticoid synthesis and release, and functional studies have shown that
the  xxxg572xxx  minimal promoter is camp responsive.28 this facilitative effect of acth on mineralocorticoid release may be most
important during times of acute stress (e.g. illness, heat, convulsion),
salt-deprivation (e.g. breastfeeding), or when there is relative mineralocorticoid insensitivity (e.g. early infancy). consequently, one
might expect acth resistant states to be associated with some disturbance in renin-sodium homeostasis. however, this is not well
established in fgd1, as the changes described previously are often
homozygous or compound heterozygous missense changes in  xxxg1385xxx 
that have some limited residual activity.10,11
the individuals described here likely represent the most severe end
of the spectrum of fgd1, and include a family who are homozygous
for a severely disruptive frameshift mutation in the receptor (579–
581deltgt leading to a stop codon at 193). in this kindred, the
proband presented with a hypoglycaemic convulsion and hyperpigmentation at 60 days of age. subsequent affected individuals were
diagnosed in the first four days of life on account of marked hyperpigmentation and hypoglycaemia, before the usual onset of salt loss
or when biochemical evidence of salt loss might be manifest. given
the family history, steroid replacement was started immediately, and
one child received fludrocortisone as it was felt the family had a recessive form of adrenal hypoplasia. in kindred ii (r146h/560delt), the
proband presented with a hypoglycaemic convulsion at 19 months
of age, after an insidious period of failure to thrive. the elevated

 xxxg1385xxx  mutations and sodium homeostasis 209
renin led to a diagnosis of adrenal hypoplasia, and it was considered
necessary to add fludrocortisone treatment to the glucocorticoid
replacement. of note, his younger sister has a very adequate cortisol
response to  xxxd1755xxx  stimulation at one month of age, but was
profoundly cortisol deficient by one year. she was found to be
hyponatraemic when she presented with a respiratory viral illness.
as her plasma renin activity was low, the low sodium could have been
due to inappropriate adh release or an inability to excrete a water
load due to hypocortisolaemia. however, in the clinical context and
with the family history, it was felt that she had a possible salt-losing
form of adrenal hypoplasia. finally, patient 1 – who harbours a severe
loss-of-function missense mutation (s74i) – had long-standing
evidence of subtle disturbances in renin-aldosterone and was eventually commenced on fludrocortisone replacement at 4 years of age
(fig. 1) as it was felt she had a subtle form of adrenal hypoplasia.
this s74i mutation is one of the more frequent mutations reported
in  xxxg1385xxx  and has been reported in approximately 10 patients
previously.2 to our knowledge, none of these other patients have
received mineralocorticoid replacement.
taken together, these cases highlight that severe loss-of-function
mutations in  xxxg1385xxx  may be found in a significant proportion of
children with primary adrenal insufficiency and who have been
diagnosed as having salt losing forms of adrenal hypoplasia. these
findings may suggest a supportive role for acth in mineralocorticoid synthesis and release, especially in times of stress, salt-restriction
or relative mineralocorticoid insensitivity. in other situations,
hyponatraemia may reflect inappropriate adh release or relative
water overload following infection or convulsions, especially in a
glucocorticoid deficient state. as biochemical data are often limited
in the acute clinical situation, and the emphasis is on saving the
child’s life, it is possible that many more children with sporadic or
familial forms of adrenal disease have been labelled as having adrenal
hypoplasia or related conditions, whereas the true pathology lies
in the  xxxg1385xxx . this study highlights the importance of obtaining
accurate data on plasma renin activity, aldosterone and salt balance
in all infants and children diagnosed with primary adrenal failure,
with particular attention being paid to assay- and age-specific normal
ranges. making the correct diagnosis has important implications for
counselling and long-term management. mineralocorticoid requirements often decrease with age, as evidenced from the fall in normal
mineralocorticoid secretion rates after infancy and from the biochemical improvement throughout childhood seen in children
with autosomal dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism type i due to
mutations in the  xxxg1602xxx . thus, infants or young
children who appear to have salt loss should be started on fludrocortisone replacement, especially if there is persistently elevated
pra, urinary sodium loss, salt craving or poor growth, or if these
parameters are not normalized on a standard regimen of glucocorticoid replacement alone. however, it might be predicted that, with
careful monitoring, these children could be weaned off their fludrocortisone supplements eventually, or at least to reserve them for
times of stress or potential volume depletion. this situation contrasts
with individuals with x-linked adrenal hypoplasia who are likely to
require mineralocorticoid replacement for life. finally, the normal
cortisol response to  xxxd1755xxx  stimulation in a one-month-old
sibling, followed by profound cortisol insufficiency at one year of

age, shows that fgd1 may be a clinically progressive condition, and
ongoing clinical vigilance or molecular analysis are needed in
relatives even if physiological tests of cortisol reserve are initially
normal.
