abstract
the janus kinase (jak) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (stat) signal cascades are major pathways that
mediate the inﬂammatory functions of interferon-c (ifn-c), an important pro-inﬂammatory cytokine. therefore, regulation of
jak/stat signaling should modulate ifn-c-mediated inﬂammation. in this study, we found that  xxxd2748xxx 
( xxxd2748xxx ), a well-known lipoxygenase (lo) inhibitor, suppressed ifn-c-induced inﬂammatory responses in brain astrocytes. in
the presence of  xxxd2748xxx , interferon regulatory factor-1 expression was signiﬁcantly reduced. expression of monocyte chemotactic
protein-1 and interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 mrna in response to ifn-c was signiﬁcantly suppressed in the presence
of  xxxd2748xxx , as was tyrosine-phosphorylation of jak and stat. however, the  xxxg147xxx  products, leukotriene b4 (ltb4) and leukotriene c4, were not detected in cells treated with ifn-c, indicating that the eﬀect of  xxxd2748xxx  seemed to be independent of  xxxg147xxx  inhibition. in addition, two other  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors (rev5901 and aa861) did not mimic the eﬀect of  xxxd2748xxx , and the  xxxg147xxx  metabolites,
5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and ltb4, were unable to reverse  xxxd2748xxx -driven suppression of stat activation or aﬀect basal
stat phosphorylation. taken together, these results suggest that  xxxd2748xxx  regulates ifn-c-mediated inﬂammation through mechanisms unrelated to the inhibition of  xxxg147xxx .

interferon-c (ifn-c) plays a key regulatory role in
inﬂammation as a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine. the signal transduction pathways involved in the action of
ifn-c have been well studied, from receptor binding
to subsequent activation of gene transcription. ifn-c
binding to the receptor triggers the phosphorylation
and activation of a  xxxg2198xxx , janus kinase
(jak), which then phosphorylates signal transducer
and activator of transcription (stat). phosphorylated
stat forms active homodimers that move into the nu*

cleus, bind to ifn-c-activated sites (gas) [1], and induce transcription of ifn-c-responsive genes [2,3] such
as interferon regulatory factor-1 (irf-1), interferongamma inducible protein-10 ( xxxg559xxx ), macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 ( xxxg357xxx ), intracellular adhesion
molecule-1 (icam-1),  xxxg1578xxx 
(inos),  xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ), and class ii
major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules
[4–8]. therefore, the jak/stat signaling pathway appears to be an ideal target for regulation of ifn-c-mediated inﬂammation [9,10].
in the brain, astrocytes and microglia participate in
inﬂammation, where they induce expression of pro-in-

ﬂammatory mediators following injury. these pro-inﬂammatory mediators directly damage brain cells and/
or recruit immune cells from the surrounding tissues
and blood, as shown by observations of microglia
migration from surrounding tissues into the damaged
area and inﬁltration of t cells from blood after brain
trauma and ischemia [11,12]. astrocytes and microglia
can communicate with t cells through the expression
of mhc molecules. the activated t cells release ifnc, which may help sustain the activation of astrocytes
and microglia [13].
leukotrienes are emerging as critical mediators of
inﬂammatory responses in allergy, asthma, and arthritis
[14]. recently, it was reported that leukotrienes also
have important roles in brain inﬂammatory reactions
and formation of cerebral edema [15].  xxxg147xxx  is the key
enzyme that metabolizes  xxxd208xxx  and produces
leukotrienes [16].
in this study, we revealed that nordihydroguaiaretic
acid ( xxxd2748xxx ), a well-known inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx , reduced
ifn-c-induced inﬂammatory responses in cultured rat
brain astrocytes.  xxxd2748xxx  treatment also reduced ifnc-induced jak/stat phosphorylation and expression
of inﬂammatory mediators such as irf-1 and  xxxg559xxx .
however, the inhibitory eﬀect of  xxxd2748xxx  seems to be
independent of  xxxg147xxx  inhibition. these results suggest
that  xxxd2748xxx  inhibits inﬂammation through separately
blocking jak/stat activation and  xxxg147xxx .

cell culture. primary astrocytes and microglia were cultured from
the cerebral cortices of 1- to 3-day-old sprague–dawley rats as previously described [17,18]. brieﬂy, the cortices were triturated into single
cells in mem containing 10% fbs and plated into 75 cm2 t-ﬂasks (0.5
hemisphere/ﬂask) for 2–3 weeks. microglia were detached from the
ﬂasks by mild shaking and ﬁltered through a nylon mesh to remove
astrocytes and cell aggregates. microglia were seeded in dishes, washed
1 h later to remove unattached cells, and attached cells were used in
experiments. astrocytes remaining in the ﬂask were harvested with
0.1% trypsin. puriﬁed astrocytes were plated in dishes and cultured in
mem supplemented with 10% fbs. c6 rat astroglioma cells were

obtained from the american type culture collection (atcc,

10 lg/ml pepstatin, 1 lg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm edta). the lysate
was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000g at 4 °c and the supernatant
was collected. proteins were separated by sds–page and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. the membrane was incubated
with primary antibodies, reacted with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system.
ltb4 and ltc4 assay. ltb4 (ltc4) was measured by enzyme
immunoassay (eia) based on the competition between eicosanoid
and an eicosanoid conjugate (tracer) for a limited amount of
speciﬁc antibody. brieﬂy, 50 ll of conditioned culture media was
mixed with 50 ll of eicosanoid tracer and 50 ll of speciﬁc antiserum, in 96-well plates that were coated with mouse monoclonal
anti-rabbit antibody for ltb4 (ltc4) and pre-washed with speciﬁc
buﬀer. after 18 h of incubation at 4 °c, the plates were washed to
remove unbound reagents, and the enzyme substrates (ellmanõs
reagent) were added for 60–90 min at room temperature. the

 xxxd2748xxx  suppresses ifn-c-induced
inﬂammatory responses in brain glial cells
since ifn-c is a prominent inﬂammatory cytokine,
researchers are currently seeking methods for therapeutically regulating ifn-c-mediated inﬂammation. here,
we show that  xxxd2748xxx , a well-known inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx  (lo), signiﬁcantly suppressed ifn-c-induced inﬂammatory responses in brain glial cells.
stat is a major pathway that mediates inﬂammatory
functions of ifn-c, so we ﬁrst analyzed the eﬀect of
 xxxd2748xxx  on ifn-c-induced stat activation by western blotting with phospho-speciﬁc antibodies. in the
range of 5–20 lm,  xxxd2748xxx  dose-dependently suppressed ifn-c-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of
stat1 and stat3 in primary cultured astrocytes
(fig. 1a). the suppressive eﬀect of  xxxd2748xxx  on stat1
phosphorylation was detected throughout the tested
time period of 5–90 min (fig. 1b). the inhibitory eﬀect

fig. 1.  xxxd2748xxx  reduces ifn-c-induced phosphorylation of stat1 and stat3 in brain glial cells. cell lysates were separated by sds-page and
western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against phospho-tyr-stat1 (py-stat1) and phospho-tyr-stat3 (py-stat) as described
in materials and methods. the membrane was stripped and analyzed sequentially with anti-stat1 antibodies. (a) primary cultured astrocytes were
treated with the indicated doses of  xxxd2748xxx  for 15 min, and then 10 u/ml ifn-c was added to cells for 30 min. (b) primary astrocytes were treated
with  xxxd2748xxx  for 15 min, and then 10 u/ml ifn-c was added for the indicated times. (c) c6 astroglioma cells, (d) primary cultured microglia, or (e)
bv2 murine microglial cells were treated with  xxxd2748xxx  for 15 min, and then 10 u/ml ifn-c for 30 min.

of  xxxd2748xxx  was also observed in c6 rat astroglioma
cells (fig. 1c). in addition, in primary cultured
microglia and bv2 murine microglial cells,  xxxd2748xxx 
produced similar inhibitory eﬀect (figs. 1d and e).
these results suggest that the inhibitory eﬀect of
 xxxd2748xxx  on ifn-c-induced stat phosphorylation
could be a general phenomenon rather than being conﬁned to speciﬁc cell types.
as jak is an upstream signaling molecule of stat,
we next examined the eﬀect of  xxxd2748xxx  on jak activation. in the presence of 20 lm  xxxd2748xxx , ifn-c induced
tyrosine phosphorylation of jak2 was signiﬁcantly reduced in both primary cultured astrocytes and c6 cells
(figs. 2a and b). therefore, the target(s) of  xxxd2748xxx  in
the ifn-c signaling pathway appear to be upstream of
jak phosphorylation.
we further examined whether treatment with  xxxd2748xxx 
could suppress expression of inﬂammatory mediators in
glial cells treated with ifn-c. when primary astrocytes
were treated with ifn-c, irf-1 protein expression was
detected within 90 min. in the presence of  xxxd2748xxx ,
irf-1 protein expression levels were signiﬁcantly reduced (fig. 3a left).  xxxg559xxx  mrna expression in response to ifn-c was also signiﬁcantly suppressed in
the presence of  xxxd2748xxx  (fig. 3a, right). similar results
were obtained in c6 cells, where expression of both
irf-1 and  xxxg559xxx  was reduced in the presence of  xxxd2748xxx 
(fig. 3b, left and right). these results suggest that
 xxxd2748xxx  suppresses ifn-c-induced inﬂammatory responses such as jak/stat activation and expression
of inﬂammatory mediators.

 xxxd2748xxx  for 15 min and then with 10 u/ml ifn-c for 30 min. western

anti-stat1 antibodies.

with the indicated doses of  xxxd2748xxx  for 15 min, and then with 10 u/ml

western blot analysis was performed using anti-irf-1 antibodies. the

latter compound is converted into leukotriene a4, which
is the precursor of the biologically active ltb4 and
the cysteinyl leukotrienes (ltc4, ltd4, and lte4)
[14]. therefore, we assayed the levels of ltb4 and
ltc4 released into the culture media after ifn-c treatment, as a measure of  xxxg147xxx  activity. unexpectedly, we
found that ifn-c treatment did not aﬀect the produc-

tion of either ltb4 or ltc4, whereas a23187 (calcium
ionophore) induced production of ltb4 (figs. 4a
and b).
next, we examined two other  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors,
rev5901 and aa861 [19,20], suppressed ifn-c-induced
stat phosphorylation. unlike our results with  xxxd2748xxx ,
we found that neither rev5901 (ic50 for  xxxg147xxx  = 6 lm)
nor aa861 (ic50 for  xxxg147xxx  = 0.8 lm) suppressed ifnc-induced stat1 and stat3 phosphorylation across
concentration ranges of 30–100 lm and 5–20 lm,
respectively (figs. 5a and b). since  xxxd2748xxx  also inhibits
12-lo, we also tested the eﬀect of a 12-lo inhibitor,
baicalein [21], but found that 2–10 lm baicalein (ic50
for 12-lo = 0.12 lm) had no eﬀect on ifn-c-induced
stat phosphorylation (fig. 5c). in addition, we found
that treatment of  xxxg147xxx  metabolites such as 5-hete and
ltb4 [22,23] did not reverse the inhibitory eﬀect of
 xxxd2748xxx  on stat phosphorylation nor did it alter basal
or ifn-c-induced stat1 phosphorylation (figs. 6a
and b). taken together, these results suggest that
 xxxd2748xxx  suppresses ifn-c-induced stat phosphorylation independent of its ability to inhibit  xxxg147xxx  enzyme
activity.

15 min followed by treatment with 10 u/ml ifn-c for 30 min. western

separated by sds–page, and western blot analysis was performed using py-stat1 and py-stat3 antibodies. the membrane was stripped and

discussion
leukotrienes such as ltb4 and the cysteinyl leukotrienes are important mediators of inﬂammation in allergy,
asthma, arthritis, and even in injured brain [14].  xxxg147xxx  is a
key enzyme that catalyzes the production of leukotrienes
from  xxxd208xxx  [16]. although ifn-c is a major
pro-inﬂammatory cytokine, little information is available
as to whether  xxxg147xxx  could be involved in the pro-inﬂammatory function of ifn-c, particularly in brain glial cells.
activation of  xxxg147xxx  depends on ca2+, p38 mapk, and/or
rac [24–27]. it has been reported that ifn-c increases
intracellular calcium [28] and activates p38 mapk [29],
and we recently found that ifn-c activates rac in astrocytes [30]. the lines of evidence led us to examine the possibility of crosstalk between ifn-c and  xxxg147xxx .
we found that the well-known  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor,
 xxxd2748xxx , suppressed ifn-c-induced inﬂammatory responses, jak/stat activation, and inﬂammatory
mediators. however, two other speciﬁc  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors,
aa-861 and rev5901, did not mimic the eﬀect of
 xxxd2748xxx  in glial cells. although  xxxd2748xxx  inhibits 12-lo
(with a slightly lower aﬃnity than that for  xxxg147xxx ) [31],
the 12-lo inhibitor baicalein had no eﬀect on ifn-cinduced stat activation. these results suggest that
 xxxd2748xxx  suppresses ifn-c-induced inﬂammatory responses independent of its eﬀects on  xxxg147xxx  and/or 12lo. the  xxxg147xxx -independent eﬀect of  xxxd2748xxx  was further
supported by our observation that levels of ltb4 and
ltc4, two ﬁnal products of  xxxg147xxx , were not induced
by ifn-c treatment of glial cells. in addition, treatment
with the  xxxg147xxx  metabolites 5-hete and ltb4 had no effect on stat activation in the presence or absence of
ifn-c and/or  xxxd2748xxx . as it was recently reported that
 xxxd2748xxx  inhibits  xxxd2738xxx  production from tnf-atreated microglia through  xxxg147xxx -independent mechanisms [32], we also examined the eﬀects of inhibitors
of  xxxg1759xxx  ( xxxd3060xxx ) and cyclooxygenase
(indomethacin and sc560), which are involved in  xxxd208xxx  metabolism along with lipoxygenase. unlike the case of  xxxd2748xxx , none of these enzyme inhibitors

suppressed ifn-c-induced stat1 or -3 phosphorylation (data not shown). these results suggest that the
inhibitory eﬀect of  xxxd2748xxx  on ifn-c-signaling could
be unrelated to  xxxd208xxx  metabolism. although
further work will be required to fully examine how
 xxxd2748xxx  suppresses ifn-c-induced inﬂammatory responses, our work and previous studies may suggest
some possibilities. one possibility is that  xxxd2748xxx  might
inhibit  xxxg2198xxx  activity, as suggested by west
et al. [32]. ifn-c binding to the receptor triggers the
tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of jak (a  xxxg2198xxx ), which in turn induces tyrosine phosphorylation of stat. therefore,  xxxd2748xxx  could suppress
tyrosine phosphorylation of jak and stat through
the inhibition of  xxxg2198xxx  activity. another possibility is that  xxxd2748xxx  could suppress ifn-c-induced
inﬂammatory responses through its antioxidant eﬀects,
as  xxxd2748xxx  has antioxidant eﬀects and antioxidants have
been shown to inhibit ifn-c function [33,34]. therefore,
the exact target(s) of  xxxd2748xxx  in ifn-c signaling should
be further studied in the future.
in sum,  xxxg147xxx  has emerged as a new therapeutic target
of inﬂammatory diseases such as asthma, inﬂammatory
bowl disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and even neurodegenerative diseases. the results in this study showed that
the  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd2748xxx , suppresses the inﬂammatory responses of ifn-c in astrocytes. therefore,
 xxxd2748xxx  or  xxxd2748xxx -like drugs could be potent and eﬀective candidate therapeutics for novel treatments of
inﬂammatory or neurodegenerative diseases.
