abstract:  xxxg1479xxx  catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from
methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, generating tetrahydrofolate and methionine. during this primary
turnover cycle, the enzyme alternates between the active methylcobalamin and  xxxd1771xxx  forms of the
enzyme. formation of the cob(ii)alamin prosthetic group by oxidation of  xxxd1771xxx  or photolysis of
methylcobalamin renders the enzyme inactive.  xxxg1479xxx  from e. coli catalyzes its own
reactivation by a reductive methylation that involves electron transfer from reduced flavodoxin and methyl
transfer from  xxxd3156xxx . this process has been proposed to involve formation of a transient  xxxd1771xxx 
intermediate that is then trapped by methyl transfer from  xxxd3156xxx . during aerobic growth of e. coli,
electrons for this process are ultimately derived from nadph, and electron transfer does not generate a
detectable level of  xxxd1771xxx  due to the large potential difference between the nadph/nadp+ couple
and the  xxxd1771xxx /cob(ii)alamin couple. in this paper, we show that even in the presence of the strong
reductant flavodoxin hydroquinone,  xxxd1771xxx  is not observed as a significant intermediate. we
demonstrate, however, that this is due to a rate-limiting reorganization of the cobalt ligand environment
from five-coordinate to four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin. mutation of aspartate 757 to glutamate results in
a cob(ii)alamin enzyme that is ∼70% four-coordinate, and reductive methylation of this enzyme using
flavodoxin hydroquinone as the electron donor proceeds through a kinetically competent  xxxd1771xxx 
intermediate. furthermore, wild-type  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme produced by chemical reduction reacts with
 xxxd3156xxx  in a kinetically competent reaction. we provide evidence that methyl transfer from  xxxd3156xxx  to
 xxxd1771xxx  enzyme results initially in formation of a five-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme that slowly
decays to the active six-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme. we propose a kinetic scheme for reductive
methylation of wild-type cob(ii)alamin enzyme by  xxxd3156xxx  and flavodoxin hydroquinone in
which slow conformational changes mask the relatively fast electron and methyl transfer steps.

 xxxg1479xxx  from e. coli
catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from methylcobalamin enzyme to homocysteine, producing  xxxd1771xxx 
enzyme and methionine. the catalytic cycle is completed
by the transfer of a methyl group from ch3-h4folate1 to
 xxxd1771xxx  enzyme, generating h4folate and regenerating
the active methylcobalamin enzyme. oxidation of  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme or photolysis of methylcobalamin enzyme
leads to formation of inactive cob(ii)alamin enzyme. in e.
coli,  xxxg1479xxx  catalyzes the reactivation of
oxidized enzyme through a reductive methylation, in which
electron transfer from reduced flavodoxin and methyl transfer

from  xxxd3156xxx  lead to regeneration of the active methylcobalamin enzyme.
since  xxxd3156xxx  was first reported to be essential for
maintaining  xxxg1479xxx  activity (1, 2), a number
of studies have examined enzyme activation and the role of
 xxxd3156xxx . taylor and weissbach first established that the
methyl group from  xxxd3156xxx  is transferred to the cofactor,
forming methylcobalamin enzyme (3), and that this activated
methylcobalamin enzyme can undergo multiple turnovers
with homocysteine and ch3-h4folate in the absence of
 xxxd3156xxx  (4). a low-potential one-electron reducing system
is also required for activity (5, 6). this reducing system

figure 1: scheme depicting the events leading to in vivo reductive
methylation of cob(ii)alamin enzyme. under aerobic conditions,
oxidized ferredoxin (flavodoxin):nadp+ oxidoreductase (fnr‚
fadox) accepts a hydride from nadph and transfers the electrons
to flavodoxin (fld‚fmnox), generating primarily flavodoxin semiquinone. under anaerobic conditions, the decarboxylation of
pyruvate is coupled to reduction of flavodoxin, forming the
flavodoxin hydroquinone as the major species. these reduced forms
of flavodoxin bind to inactive cob(ii)alamin enzyme, leading to a
conformational change that is coupled with dissociation of his759
and protonation of the his759-asp757-ser810 triad (15, 16, 22).
electron transfer and methyl transfer result in formation of active
methylcobalamin enzyme. although nadph oxidation ultimately
produces 2 equiv of flavodoxin semiquinone, only one electron is
transferred to  xxxg1479xxx  during reductive methylation.
midpoint potentials cited are literature values (11, 15, 30).

was later shown to be involved in reductive methylation of
oxidized enzyme (7), but is not required for anaerobic
turnover of methylcobalamin enzyme with homocysteine and
ch3-h4folate (8, 9). more recently it has been shown that
electron transfer and methyl transfer are thermodynamically
coupled reactions, and that the rate of formation of methylcobalamin enzyme is dependent on the degree of reduction
of the oxidized enzyme (10). these experiments have led
to a model for reductive methylation in which electron
transfer leads to formation of a trace amount of  xxxd1771xxx 
enzyme, which is trapped by irreversible methyl transfer from
 xxxd3156xxx  (10).
during aerobic growth, the electrons for reductive methylation are derived from nadph via ferredoxin (flavodoxin):
nadp+ oxidoreductase and flavodoxin [formerly referred
to as the r and f proteins (7, 11, 12, 13, 14), figure 1].
under these conditions, electron transfer from reduced
oxidoreductase to flavodoxin produces flavodoxin semiquinone as the major species. since the flavodoxin semiquinone/oxidized midpoint potential [em7 ) -260 mv vs
she (15)] is much higher than the  xxxd1771xxx /cob(ii)alamin midpoint potential [em7 ) -490 mv (16)], the
equilibrium does not favor  xxxd1771xxx  formation, and it is
not formed as a detectable intermediate following electron
transfer from flavodoxin semiquinone to cob(ii)alamin
enzyme (17). in vitro, photochemical reduction of flavodoxin with deazaflavin and edta (18) allows conversion
to the hydroquinone oxidation state. since the flavodoxin
hydroquinone/semiquinone couple [em7 ) -440 mv (15)]
is close to the  xxxd1771xxx /cob(ii)alamin couple,  xxxd1771xxx  should be observed following electron transfer from
flavodoxin hydroquinone to cob(ii)alamin enzyme. flavodoxin hydroquinone is also the major form of flavodoxin
during anaerobic growth of e. coli, where it is produced by
the action of a thiamine diphosphate-dependent pyruvate:
flavodoxin oxidoreductase (19).

jarrett et al.
recent studies have demonstrated that reorganization of
the cobalt ligand environment and changes in the protein
conformation are events that probably precede the electron
and methyl group transfer steps that reactivate methionine
synthase. the cobalt ligand environment in the wild-type
cob(ii)alamin enzyme is predominantly five-coordinate (9),
with four equatorial nitrogen ligands provided by the corrin
macrocycle and one axial nitrogen ligand provided by
histidine 759 from the protein (20, 21). reduction to the
 xxxd1771xxx  oxidation state is coupled to dissociation of
his759 and protonation of the his759-asp757-ser810 hydrogen-bonded triad (16), resulting in formation of a fourcoordinate  xxxd1771xxx  cofactor. flavodoxin binding favors
reorganization of the five-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme
to four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin (15), an event that may
prepare the cobalamin cofactor for electron transfer from the
reduced flavin. reorganization of the cobalt ligand environment appears to be coupled with a conformational change
that alters the reactivity of the  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme.  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme that is generated from methylcobalamin
enzyme during primary turnover reacts rapidly with ch3h4folate, but is much less reactive with  xxxd3156xxx  or flavodoxin, while  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme that is generated by
reduction is reactive with  xxxd3156xxx  and flavodoxin, but is
unreactive with ch3-h4folate (22). these  xxxd1771xxx 
enzymes prepared by different routes also differ in their
proteolytic fragmentation pathways when they are treated
with trypsin (22). together, these studies suggest that
reductive methylation is associated with an altered conformation of the enzyme that is stabilized by flavodoxin binding.
in this paper, we demonstrate that reorganization of the
cob(ii)alamin ligand environment and/or the accompanying
conformational change is the rate-limiting step in the overall
reductive methylation pathway when flavodoxin hydroquinone is the electron donor. bypassing this reorganization
by mutation of asp757 to glutamate allows observation of
 xxxd1771xxx  as a discrete intermediate.  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme, produced by the reaction of asp757glu cob(ii)alamin
enzyme with flavodoxin hydroquinone or by chemical
reduction of wild-type cob(ii)alamin enzyme (22), reacts
rapidly with  xxxd3156xxx . we use stopped-flow spectroscopy
with a uv/visible diode-array detector to record absorption
spectra of intermediates at intervals throughout these reactions, and are able to model the resulting spectra using
previously reported spectra of the wild-type, asp757glu, and
his759gly enzymes (21). we further show that the immediate product of reductive methylation is an enzyme that
has a spectrum similar to the methylcobalamin his759gly
enzyme, suggesting that the five-coordinate methylcobalamin
cofactor is an intermediate in reductive methylation of wildtype enzyme. this five-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme
decays in a kinetically competent manner to the active sixcoordinate methylcobalamin enzyme, a process that we
propose is associated with conversion back to the active
primary turnover conformation of the enzyme.
materials and methods
materials. construction of the asp757glu mutation of
 xxxg1479xxx  and the methods for purification of
overexpressed wild-type and mutant enzymes have been
described (23). wild-type  xxxg1479xxx  was converted to the cob(ii)alamin form by anaerobic treatment with

reductive methylation of  xxxg1479xxx 
homocysteine and dithiothreitol, followed by gel filtration
chromatography (24). asp757glu cob(ii)alamin methionine
synthase is easily oxidized in air; therefore, the enzyme was
first converted to the methylcobalamin form by reductive
methylation with  xxxd3156xxx  in an electrochemical cell (24).
immediately prior to use in stopped-flow experiments, the
enzyme was equilibrated with an argon atmosphere and
converted to cob(ii)alamin enzyme by photolysis (described
below). flavodoxin was overexpressed and purified as
previously described (25). the following were obtained from
the indicated commercial sources and used without further
purification: l-homocysteine thiolactone and s-adenosyl-lmethionine (iodide salt) from sigma; methyl viologen and
protocatechuic acid from aldrich; (6r,s)-ch3-h4folate (calcium salt) from schirks laboratories. titanium(iii) citrate
(80 mm) was prepared from titanium(iii) chloride (1.9 m
in 2 m hcl, aldrich) as described previously (24, 26).
phosphate buffer refers to potassium phosphate buffer at ph
7.2, unless otherwise specified.
for stopped-flow studies of reductive methylation, flavodoxin was reduced to the semiquinone or hydroquinone
oxidation state by photoirradiation in the presence of
deazaflavin and edta (18). oxidized flavodoxin (150 µm)
and 5-deazaflavin-3-sulfonate were mixed in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.5 mm edta, and placed
in a glass tonometer along with protocatechuic acid (0.5
mm), while protocatechuate dioxygenase (∼0.1 mg) was
placed in a sidearm. semiquinone flavodoxin was obtained
using 1 µm deazaflavin, while hydroquinone flavodoxin was
obtained using 10 µm deazaflavin. the tonometer was
equilibrated with argon, and protocatechuate dioxygenase
was mixed with the flavodoxin solution to remove residual
oxygen. the tonometer was immersed in cold water and
irradiated with a 600 w tungsten/halogen lamp through the
side of the beaker. after three 10 s exposures, the semiquinone protein appears as a dark blue solution while the
hydroquinone protein appears as a pale yellow solution. uv/
visible spectra of each protein solution were used to estimate
the relative concentrations of oxidized, semiquinone, and
hydroquinone oxidation states.
to measure  xxxd3156xxx -dependent reductive methylation,
wild-type cob(ii)alamin enzyme (30 µm) and  xxxd3156xxx  (200
µm) were mixed in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer in a
glass tonometer, and equilibrated with argon. to avoid rapid
oxidation of asp757glu cob(ii)alamin enzyme in air, this
mutant enzyme was prepared as a solution of methylcobalamin enzyme (30 µm) and  xxxd3156xxx  (200 µm) in 10 mm
potassium phosphate buffer in a glass tonometer. following
equilibration with argon, the enzyme was converted to the
cob(ii)alamin oxidation state by 5 s irradiation with a 600
w tungsten/halogen lamp as described above. to maintain
anaerobiosis, all solutions were prepared with protocatechuic
acid and protocatechuate dioxygenase as described above.
the cob(ii)alamin enzyme and  xxxd3156xxx  were rapidly mixed
with reduced flavodoxin in an anaerobic stopped-flow
spectrophotometer at 25 °c, and spectra were recorded at
intervals from 2 ms to 10 s using a xenon lamp and a diodearray spectrophotometer. to minimize photoreduction of the
deazaflavin and slow photolysis of the methylcobalamin
product, a 360 nm cutoff filter was inserted in the light path
immediately following the xenon lamp. single-wavelength

biochemistry, vol. 37, no. 36, 1998 12651
kinetic traces were also obtained using a tungsten lamp, a
monochromator, and a photomultiplier tube.
the conversion of five-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme
to four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme accompanying
flavodoxin binding was measured by rapidly mixing wildtype cob(ii)alamin enzyme (30 µm) +  xxxd3156xxx  (200 µm)
with oxidized flavodoxin (150 µm), both in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.2, in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer at 25 °c. spectra were measured before and
after the reaction, and spectral changes were followed at 465
and 477 nm. the methylation of  xxxd1771xxx  methionine
synthase by  xxxd3156xxx  was observed by reducing the wildtype enzyme with titanium(iii) citrate (24). wild-type cob(ii)alamin enzyme (30 µm) in 10 mm tris, ph 7.2, was
placed in a tonometer and equilibrated with argon. titanium(iii) citrate (4 mm) was added with a syringe and the enzyme
equilibrated for 10 min, producing enzyme that contains
∼70-80%  xxxd1771xxx  and ∼20-30% cob(ii)alamin cofactor. this enzyme mixture was rapidly mixed in a stoppedflow spectrophotometer with  xxxd3156xxx  (200 µm) at 25 °c,
and spectra were recorded from 2 ms to 1 s using the diodearray configuration described above. single-wavelength
traces were obtained at selected wavelengths to monitor the
formation and decay of transient intermediates.
results
a scheme for the participation of  xxxd1771xxx  as an
intermediate in reductive methylation. reductive methylation of wild-type cob(ii)alamin  xxxg1479xxx  is
accomplished via electron transfer from reduced flavodoxin
and methyl transfer from  xxxd3156xxx ; presumably both transfers
directly involve the cobalamin cofactor. electron transfer
to the five-coordinate cob(ii)alamin cofactor would generate
 xxxd1771xxx  as an intermediate and require prior or concomitant dissociation of his759 from the cobalt, while methyl
transfer to this  xxxd1771xxx  intermediate must regenerate
the resting six-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme, and
therefore requires recoordination of his759 to the cobalt.
based on these necessary chemical events, a scheme is
proposed for changes in the cobalamin oxidation state and
coordination environment that lead from five-coordinate cob(ii)alamin to six-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme (figure
2, top). each of these proposed species has been generated
by chemical treatment of the wild-type enzyme or by
mutagenesis, and each has a unique uv/visible spectrum
(figure 2). these unique spectra in principle allow direct
observation of each species as a transient intermediate using
stopped-flow uv/visible spectroscopy. unfortunately, the
observations are complicated by temporal overlap of the
kinetic phases, and transient changes in the spectra of the
enzyme during reductive methylation often arise from
mixtures of the intermediate species. to analyze the
experiments described below, we have estimated rate constants by fitting single-wavelength transient absorbance
changes, including those shown in figures 4-7, to multiple
exponential functions. these rate constants were then
substituted into the various kinetic steps in figure 2, and
hopkinsim kinetic modeling software (d. wachsstock,
johns hopkins university) was used to simulate transient
changes in the concentrations of each intermediate (data not
shown). we were then able to model the transient absorbance changes using known extinction coefficients for each

reductive methylation of  xxxg1479xxx  with flavodoxin
hydroquinone (]): 30 µm enzyme and 200 µm  xxxd3156xxx  were
mixed with 150 µm flavodoxin hydroquinone in a stopped-flow
spectrophotometer, and the reaction was monitored at several
wavelengths (525 nm trace shown here). although the reaction is
multiphasic, a rough estimate of the rate constant can be calculated
from the half-time of ∼1.2 s at 25 °c; reductive methylation
proceeds approximately 50-fold faster in the presence of flavodoxin
hydroquinone than in the presence of an equal concentration of
flavodoxin semiquinone. the solid curve is fit to a five-exponential
function using a marquardt-levenberg algorithm while holding
fixed the four rate constants determined from the data in figure 4.
figure 2: general scheme for the sequence of reactions and
intermediates in reductive methylation is shown at the top of the
figure. five-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme (i) is converted to
four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme (ii) by dissociation and
protonation of the lower axial ligand, and then reduced to  xxxd1771xxx  (iii) by electron transfer from flavodoxin or chemical
reductants. methyl transfer from  xxxd3156xxx  to  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme
(iii) generates five-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme (iv), which
is then converted to the stable six-coordinate methylcobalamin
enzyme (v) by recoordination of the lower axial ligand. upper

and six-coordinate methylcobalamin (v, ‚‚‚). spectra of fourcoordinate cob(ii)alamin and five-coordinate methylcobalamin are
based on experimentally determined spectra of the his759gly
mutant enzyme. spectra of  xxxd1771xxx  and six-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme are those measured for wild-type enzyme. the
five-coordinate cob(ii)alamin spectrum is calculated from the wildtype spectrum assuming the wild-type enzyme is a mixture of 85%
five-coordinate and 15% four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme.

of the intermediate species. using these modeled data, we
have predicted spectra of the enzyme mixtures at various
times throughout reductive methylation and compared the
predicted spectra to spectra recorded with a stopped-flow
diode-array spectrophotometer. successive iterations of this
process have developed a self-consistent kinetic and spectral
interpretation of the experiments described below.
the rate of reductive methylation of cob(ii)alamin
enzyme is partially limited by the reduction potential of
the in vivo reducing system. in vivo reducing systems that
provide electrons for reductive methylation of cob(ii)alamin
 xxxg1479xxx  in e. coli include nadph and ferre-

doxin (flavodoxin):nadp+ oxidoreductase (7), yielding
flavodoxin in the semiquinone oxidation state, and pyruvate
and pyruvate:flavodoxin oxidoreductase, yielding flavodoxin
in the hydroquinone oxidation state (19). figure 3 compares
the rate of reduction of enzyme in the cob(ii)alamin form in
the presence of  xxxd3156xxx  and an excess of either the
flavodoxin semiquinone or the hydroquinone. we have
assumed that the 75 µm concentration of reduced flavodoxin
is sufficient to saturate  xxxg1479xxx  (15), although
this has not been rigorously tested. in the presence of
flavodoxin semiquinone, cob(ii)alamin enzyme is cleanly
converted to methylcobalamin with an apparent rate constant
of 0.01 s-1 at 25 ° c (figure 3, squares). in the presence of
flavodoxin hydroquinone, the rate of reductive methylation
was increased considerably relative to rates with flavodoxin
semiquinone as donor. however, the formation of methylcobalamin enzyme is kinetically complex when flavodoxin
hydroquinone is the electron donor (figure 3, diamonds); to
allow comparison to the reaction with flavodoxin semiquinone (squares), we have used changes in absorbance at
525 nm as a crude measure of the rate of methylcobalamin
formation. based on these data, the half-time for formation
of methylcobalamin enzyme is estimated to be ∼1.2 s,
indicating an approximately 50-fold increase in the rate of
methylation as compared to the reaction with flavodoxin
semiquinone. since the primary difference between these
experiments is the redox state of flavodoxin, the rate of
reductive methylation with flavodoxin semiquinone as
electron donor must be at least partially limited by the
relatively high midpoint potential of the flavodoxin semiquinone/oxidized couple. the poor reducing power of

reductive methylation of  xxxg1479xxx 

figure 4: spectral changes observed during reductive methylation
of cob(ii)alamin enzyme by excess  xxxd3156xxx  and flavodoxin
hydroquinone suggest that early intermediates are formed during
reductive methylation. experimental conditions are the same as in
figure 3 (]). an initial increase in absorbance at 390 nm (o) and
580 nm (4) suggests that electron transfer from flavodoxin
hydroquinone to cob(ii)alamin (kobs ) 130 s-1) leads to formation
of  xxxd1771xxx  and flavodoxin semiquinone, reaching a maximum
concentration of ∼0.5 ( 0.2 µm  xxxd1771xxx  at 11 ms. the
absorbance at 390 nm dissipates and the absorbance of the mixture
increases at 450 nm (0, kobs ) 25 s-1), while spectral changes are
not initially observed at 525 nm (]). this suggests that an
intermediate is formed at ∼80 ms with a maximal absorbance at
∼450 nm prior to the formation of significant amounts of
six-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme. formation of active
methylcobalamin enzyme is then observed at 525 nm (]) and
proceeds in two phases with apparent rate constants of 10 and 0.5
s-1. in each case, the solid curve is a simulation using the spectra
in figure 2 and the kinetic scheme depicted in figure 8. for 390
nm data (circles), the solid curve is simulated with ∆em ) -4 mv
for electron transfer, while the dashed curves indicate simulations
with ∆em ) -20 mv (upper curve) and +20 mv (lower curve).
kinetic traces have been shifted along the vertical axis to allow
easier comparison.

flavodoxin semiquinone may result in a decrease in the
electron transfer rate and/or the resulting  xxxd1771xxx 
population; both of these effects would decrease the overall
rate of reductive methylation.
when the reaction of cob(ii)alamin enzyme with  xxxd3156xxx 
and flavodoxin hydroquinone was monitored at several
wavelengths, it appeared that the enzyme was methylated
in at least three separate stages (figures 3 and 4). initially,
over the time range from 0.001 to 0.5 s, a small rapid increase
in absorbance at 390 nm suggests that ∼10% of the enzyme
is reduced to  xxxd1771xxx  with an apparent rate constant of
130 s-1 (figure 4, circles). the absorbance at 390 nm then
decreases with a rate constant of 25 s-1 (circles), and the
absorbance at 450 nm increases at 25 s-1 (figure 4, squares).
the absorbance at 450 nm then falls  xxxd1891xxx  s-1 (squares),
while the absorbance at 525 nm (figure 4, diamonds)
increases with the same rate constant. on a somewhat slower
time scale (0.5-10 s), the continued increase in absorbance
at 525 nm suggests that ∼80% of the enzyme is converted
directly from cob(ii)alamin to methylcobalamin with an
apparent rate constant of ∼0.5 s-1 (figure 4, diamonds).
finally, on a much slower time scale (10-200 s), ∼10% of
the enzyme is converted from cob(ii)alamin to methylcobalamin with an apparent rate constant of 0.02 s-1 (figure
3, diamonds). we are unable to model this final very slow
phase of methylation, which may be a reaction of damaged

biochemistry, vol. 37, no. 36, 1998 12653
enzyme, and it has been ignored in figure 4 and subsequent
data analyses. the ratio of the amplitudes of the fast (0.0010.5 s) methylation reactions to the slower (0.5-10 s) reaction
(∼1:8) is similar to the ratio of four-coordinate to fivecoordinate cob(ii)alamin that was observed for the wild-type
enzyme by epr spectroscopy (21), suggesting that dissociation of his759 from the cob(ii)alamin cofactor may be
limiting the rate of the slow phase of reductive methylation.
dissociation of his759 from the cobalt is rate-limiting
in the conversion of cob(ii)alamin enzyme to methylcobalamin enzyme. using epr and uv/visible spectroscopy,
we have previously shown that flavodoxin binding to cob(ii)alamin  xxxg1479xxx  results in dissociation of
his759 from the cobalt (15). this results in a shift in the
principle visible absorption band from 477 to 465 nm and
an increase in the extinction coefficient from 9470 to 12 500
m-1 cm-1 (21). we rapidly mixed oxidized flavodoxin with
wild-type cob(ii)alamin in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer and were able to use this spectral shift to detect formation
of the four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme. we found that
dissociation of his759 from the cobalt occurs at approximately the same rate as the slow phase for reductive
methylation of wild-type enzyme (kobs ) 0.4 s-1, figure 5,
solid curve), suggesting that this event is rate-limiting in the
reductive methylation of five-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme. to verify that the spectral changes seen were due to
dissociation of his759 from the cobalt, spectra of the enzyme
solutions prior to mixing and after 80 s were used to calculate
a difference spectrum for the complete reaction (figure 5,
inset). this difference spectrum was compared with one
calculated using the spectra of wild-type and his759gly cob(ii)alamin enzymes (21). differences between the predicted
and measured difference spectra from 480 to 550 nm may
indicate that the his759gly mutant is not a perfect model
for wild-type four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme.
the asp757glu mutant enzyme contains four-coordinate
cob(ii)alamin and allows direct observation of the electron
and methyl transfer reactions. mutation of asp757 to glu
results in a cob(ii)alamin enzyme that contains ∼70% fourcoordinate and ∼30% five-coordinate cob(ii)alamin (21). if
dissociation of his759 from the cobalt is rate-limiting in
reductive methylation, the four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin
enzyme should be completely methylated at a rate that is
comparable to the fast phase observed for wild-type enzyme,
and  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme should be observed as a discrete
intermediate. we mixed asp757glu cob(ii)alamin enzyme
and  xxxd3156xxx  with flavodoxin hydroquinone, and observed
an increase in absorbance at 390 and 580 nm that suggested
electron transfer from flavodoxin hydroquinone to cob(ii)alamin, forming  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme and flavodoxin semiquinone with an apparent rate constant of 130 s-1 (figure
6a). since initial changes in absorbance at 390 nm are
primarily due to  xxxd1771xxx  formation and changes in
absorbance at 580 nm are primarily due to flavodoxin
semiquinone formation, we used known extinction coefficients for these enzyme forms to calculate the stoichiometry
of product formation during electron transfer (figure 6b).
the initial rise in absorbance at 390 and 580 nm corresponded to approximately stoichiometric  xxxd1771xxx  (4.7
µm at 15 ms) and flavodoxin semiquinone (4.2 µm at 15
ms) formation. the absorbance at 390 nm subsequently falls,

figure 5: conversion of wild-type five-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme to four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme. wild-type cob(ii)alamin enzyme (15 µm) and  xxxd3156xxx  (200 µm) were mixed with oxidized flavodoxin (150 µm), and spectral changes were monitored at
465 nm (0). the rate of his759 dissociation (kobs ) 0.4 s-1, solid curve) is compared to reductive methylation catalyzed by excess flavodoxin
hydroquinone as assessed from the ∆a525 trace in figure 4 (dashed curve). the changes in the spectrum of the cob(ii)alamin enzyme:
flavodoxin mixture (inset, o) are modeled using spectra of the wild-type and his759gly cob(ii)alamin enzyme [solid curve (21)], suggesting
that the observed spectral changes correspond to dissociation of his759 from the cobalt. the rate of his759 dissociation and the rate of the
slowest phase of reductive methylation (over the range 2-10 s) are fit with similar rate constants (0.4 and 0.5 s-1, respectively), suggesting
that dissociation of his759 and accompanying conformational changes (22) may be largely rate-limiting in reductive methylation with
 xxxd3156xxx  and flavodoxin hydroquinone.

and the absorbance at 535 nm rises; these absorbance changes
are biphasic and share apparent rate constants of 25 and 10
s-1 (figure 6a). these spectral changes correspond to the
conversion of  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme to methylcobalamin
enzyme; the source of two kinetic rate constants becomes
apparent in experiments described below.
to characterize the intermediates formed during reductive
methylation of the asp757glu enzyme, we modeled the
spectra obtained at intervals throughout the reaction, using
the previously reported spectra of the asp757glu and
his759gly mutant enzymes and the known spectra of
flavodoxin hydroquinone and semiquinone. the ratios of
components in mixtures of intermediates were predicted
using the kinetic model described in figure 8 and hopkinsim kinetic modeling software. a difference spectrum
representing the initial phase of electron transfer was
generated by subtracting spectra recorded  xxxd1891xxx  and 2.6 ms
(figure 6c, upper panel), and is accurately modeled to
conversion of 2.1 µm four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme
to 1.7 µm  xxxd1771xxx  and 0.4 µm five-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme, and conversion of 2.1 µm flavodoxin
hydroquinone to semiquinone. a difference spectrum was
also generated for the subsequent methylation of asp757glu
 xxxd1771xxx  enzyme by subtracting spectra recorded at 200
and 26 ms (figure 6c, lower panel). this difference
spectrum is somewhat more difficult to simulate due to the
mixing of kinetic phases corresponding to methylation and
to reduction of additional cob(ii)alamin enzyme. the
primary reaction modeled is the conversion of 3.3 µm fourcoordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme and 2.4 µm  xxxd1771xxx 
enzyme to 1.3 µm five-coordinate and 4.7 µm six-coordinate

methylcobalamin enzyme. these reactions are accompanied
by conversion of an additional 3.3 µm flavodoxin hydroquinone to semiquinone.
as described in more detail for the wild-type enzyme
(below), we have invoked a five-coordinate methylcobalamin
enzyme as a transient intermediate in reductive methylation
to account for the apparent biphasic kinetics observed for
methylation of  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme. the spectrum of
his759gly methylcobalamin enzyme [figure 2 (21)] was
used for accurate simulation of the observed difference
spectra. the dashed curve in figure 6c corresponds to a
calculated spectrum assuming  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme is converted directly to six-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme,
while the solid curve assumes initial formation of fivecoordinate methylcobalamin enzyme at 25 s-1 followed by
conversion to six-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme  xxxd1891xxx 
s-1.
chemical reduction of wild-type enzyme to the  xxxd1771xxx  form allows observation of methyl transfer and
recoordination of his759 to the cobalt. although the
mutation of asp757 to glu allowed observation of intermediates in reductive methylation, these experiments did not
allow unambiguous identification of five-coordinate methylcobalamin cofactor as the immediate product of methyl
transfer from  xxxd3156xxx  to the  xxxd1771xxx  prosthetic group.
identification was complicated by overlap between changes
in the flavodoxin spectrum and critical regions of the
cobalamin spectrum. we were able to avoid this spectral
interference by chemically reducing wild-type cob(ii)alamin
enzyme with titanium(iii) citrate (22, 26). this chemical
reduction resulted in formation of a mixture of ∼8 µm cob-

reductive methylation of  xxxg1479xxx 

figure 6: reductive methylation of asp757glu cob(ii)alamin
enzyme confirms that  xxxd1771xxx  is formed as a competent
intermediate during reductive methylation. asp757glu cob(ii)alamin enzyme is ∼70% four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin, and this
fraction of the enzyme can react with reduced flavodoxin without
prior rate-limiting dissociation of his759 from the cobalt. asp757glu
cob(ii)alamin enzyme [20 µm total, ∼14 µm four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin] was rapidly mixed with  xxxd3156xxx  (100 µm) and
flavodoxin hydroquinone (75 µm) in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. (a) changes in absorbance at 390 nm (o), 535 nm (0),
and 580 nm (]) are plotted vs time after mixing; curves have been
shifted arbitrarily along the y-axis to allow easier comparison. (b)
the initial changes in absorbance at 390 and 580 nm were used to
calculate the concentration of  xxxd1771xxx  and flavodoxin semiquinone over the first 15 ms using previously reported extinction
coefficients (15, 16). the similarity of these calculated curves
suggests that electron transfer is approximately stoichiometric. slight
differences between these curves may be due to uncertainties in
the extinction coefficients of the proteins involved. (c) upper

390 nm (figure 7a, circles) coincided with an increase in
absorbance at 450 nm (squares), and both were associated
with an apparent rate constant of 25 s-1. the absorbance at

throughout the reaction, and have simulated the observed

figure 8: kinetic model used to simulate steps in the reductive methylation of wild-type and asp757glu cob(ii)alamin enzyme. the
inactive cob(ii)alamin enzyme contains tightly bound  xxxd3156xxx  and is an equilibrium mixture of five-coordinate and four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin forms (21). flavodoxin binding is coupled to proton uptake and conversion to the four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin cofactor (15).
electron transfer from flavodoxin hydroquinone to four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin in the asp757glu mutant is nearly equipotential (∆em )
-4 mv). for these simulations, the midpoint potential used for the four-coordinate wild-type cob(ii)alamin/ xxxd1771xxx  couple is assumed
to be the same as the experimentally determined potential for the asp757glu enzyme [em ) -436 mv (16)]. the observed rate constant
for this step is 130 s-1 in both wild-type and mutant enzymes; forward and reverse electron transfer rates are calculated assuming kobs )
k2 + k-2 and k2/k-2 ) 10(-∆em/59.2). transfer of the methyl group from  xxxd3156xxx  to the cobalt is irreversible and proceeds with a rate constant
of 25 s-1. dissociation of flavodoxin semiquinone,  xxxd3157xxx , and a proton is accompanied by recoordination of his759 to the cobalt.
six-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme is formed with an observed rate constant of 10 s-1.

formation of six-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme is
calculated by subtracting spectra recorded at 600 and 100
ms (figure 7b, squares); this spectrum is modeled to
conversion of 2.4 µm  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme and 2 µm fivecoordinate methylcobalamin enzyme to 4.4 µm six-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme (solid curve). in each case,
the dashed curve represents a calculated spectrum assuming
 xxxd1771xxx  enzyme is converted directly to six-coordinate
methylcobalamin enzyme. in this experiment, it is apparent
that an accurate fit of the kinetic and spectral data is only
possible if one assumes that five-coordinate methylcobalamin
enzyme is formed as an intermediate following transfer of a
methyl group from  xxxd3156xxx  to  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme.
discussion
methionine biosynthesis involves transfer of a methyl
group from ch3-h4folate to homocysteine; both are relatively
unreactive substrates at neutral ph. catalysis is achieved
by the  xxxg1479xxx  in part by
using  xxxd1771xxx  as a highly reactive nucleophile toward
ch3-h4folate. however,  xxxd1771xxx  is a potent reductant,
and this catalytic scheme requires that the enzyme either
stabilize and protect  xxxd1771xxx  during catalysis or develop
a strategy for regenerating  xxxd1771xxx  following inadvertent
oxidation. in a strictly anaerobic environment such as is
found in methanogenic and acetogenic bacteria, coi corrinoids may be relatively stable (27). in adapting to an
aerobic environment where oxidation to inactive cob(ii)alamin is a more common event, e. coli has evolved a system
that regenerates methylcobalamin enzyme, using flavodoxin
as electron donor and  xxxd3156xxx  as methyl donor. human
 xxxg1479xxx  is reactivated in a similar manner, using
reducing equivalents generated by a protein that incorporates
flavodoxin- and flavodoxin reductase-like components in a
single polypeptide chain (28).

the activation system in  xxxg1479xxx  must
circumvent a highly unfavorable redox potential for transfer
of electrons to cob(ii)alamin. the intracellular redox
potential of e. coli during aerobic growth is controlled by
the nadph/nadp+ ratio, which is ≈1 (29), establishing
an effective potential of -330 mv (30). this potential is
much higher than that for free  xxxd1771xxx /cob(ii)alamin,
which is -610 mv (31). the interactions of methionine
synthase with bound cobalamin act to raise the potential of
the  xxxd1771xxx /cob(ii)alamin couple to -490 mv (16). in
principle, conversion of five-coordinate to four-coordinate
cob(ii)alamin would be expected to further raise the midpoint
potential for reduction of cob(ii)alamin (31). coupling
reduction to irreversible methyl transfer from the reactive
methyl donor,  xxxd3156xxx , provides a large free energy decrease
to drive the overall reaction (10). thus, even under aerobic
conditions, irreversible methyl transfer from  xxxd3156xxx  is able
to trap the small amount of  xxxd1771xxx  produced and
eventually return all of the enzyme to the active methylcobalamin form.
to facilitate reduction of cob(ii)alamin enzyme, the bound
five-coordinate cob(ii)alamin prosthetic group is destabilized
relative to the free cofactor. at neutral ph, the free cofactor
exists in an equilibrium between five- and four-coordinate
cob(ii)alamin that strongly favors the five-coordinate species
[keq ) 62 (31)], while the enzyme-bound cofactor is ∼1015% four-coordinate [keq ≈ 5.5-9 (21)]. flavodoxin binds
to the cob(ii)alamin enzyme, and this interaction further
stabilizes the four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin conformation, as
assessed by epr and uv/visible spectroscopy (15). measurements of the rate of conversion of five-coordinate to fourcoordinate cob(ii)alamin upon binding flavodoxin to  xxxg1479xxx , described in this paper (figure 4),
demonstrate that the conversion is slow (kobs ≈ 0.4 s-1). in
fact, the rate of four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin formation is

reductive methylation of  xxxg1479xxx 
comparable to the overall rate of reductive methylation
catalyzed by  xxxd3156xxx  and flavodoxin hydroquinone, indicating that this conversion is the rate-limiting step in reductive
methylation.
mutation of asp757 to glutamate stabilizes four-coordinate
cob(ii)alamin, bypassing this rate-limiting conformational
change and allowing observation of subsequent intermediates
in reductive methylation. when asp757glu cob(ii)alamin
enzyme reacts with  xxxd3156xxx  and flavodoxin hydroquinone,
 xxxd1771xxx  enzyme forms rapidly (kobs ) 130 s-1, figure
6a-c). these experiments with the asp757glu mutant
enzyme provide the first conclusive spectral evidence that
the immediate product of electron transfer is the reduced  xxxd1771xxx  cofactor. since the difference in midpoint potential
between the asp757glu  xxxd1771xxx /cob(ii)alamin couple
and the flavodoxin hydroquinone/semiquinone couple is
known (∆em7 ) -4 mv), and if we assume that complex
formation with flavodoxin alters neither redox potential, we
can calculate the forward and reverse electron transfer rates
as 70 and 60 s-1 (figure 8, assuming kobs ) kf + kr).
the spectral changes observed during this fast electron
transfer step (figure 6c, upper panel) are accurately modeled
if we assume that only the ∼70% four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme is reduced by flavodoxin in this phase. the
remaining five-coordinate asp757glu cob(ii)alamin enzyme
is methylated at a much slower rate (kobs ≈ 0.5 s-1, data not
shown); presumably this rate is limited by the conversion
of five-coordinate to four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme.
either the five-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme does not
bind flavodoxin productively or the  xxxd1771xxx /cob(ii)alamin couple is too low for effective reduction by flavodoxin. further experiments will be required to distinguish
these possibilities.
in modeling the data for the wild-type enzyme shown in
figure 4, we have assumed the same midpoint potential for
reduction of the four-coordinate wild-type enzyme as for the
asp757glu mutant protein (em7 ) -436 mv, ∆em ) -4
mv). however, attempts to measure the midpoint potential
of the wild-type  xxxg1479xxx  in the presence of a
20-fold excess of flavodoxin hydroquinone (300 µm) yielded
a value of -510 mv [∆em ) +60 mv (15)]. due to
uncertainties in our estimates of the initial amount of wildtype four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme and in the
transient amount of  xxxd1771xxx  formed [the kinetic phase
associated with  xxxd1771xxx  formation overlaps with that
for methylcobalamin formation, as shown in figure 4], we
are not able to estimate ∆em for the wild-type enzyme
accurately from our data and can accommodate a range of
values from -40 to +40 mv. the forward and reverse
electron transfer rates associated with reduction of wild-type
enzyme, calculated explicitly from kobs and ∆em for the
asp757glu mutant enzyme in figure 8, could likewise
encompass a relatively large range of values for the wildtype enzyme: k2 ) 20-110 s-1 and k-2 ) 110-20 s-1. thus,
our estimates of the ∆em values and rates for electron transfer
in the wild-type  xxxg1479xxx :flavodoxin complex
should be regarded as tentative.
the asp757glu  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme is rapidly methylated by  xxxd3156xxx  (figure 6a). the resulting spectral changes
(figure 6c) are modeled most accurately assuming the
enzyme initially forms a five-coordinate methylcobalamin
enzyme (k3 ) 25 s-1) which then converts to six-coordinate

biochemistry, vol. 37, no. 36, 1998 12657
methylcobalamin enzyme (k4 ) 10 s-1, figure 8). chemical
reduction of wild-type enzyme allows direct observation of
the methyl transfer steps without interference from spectral
changes due to electron transfer (figure 7). when wildtype  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme reacts with  xxxd3156xxx , the initial
spectral changes suggest disappearance of  xxxd1771xxx  and
formation of a five-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme
species, similar to the his759gly mutant enzyme, with an
absorption maximum at 450 nm (21). this five-coordinate
methylcobalamin enzyme is then converted to six-coordinate
methylcobalamin enzyme (figure 7), in a kinetic step that
is presumably also associated with flavodoxin dissociation
and conversion to the active enzyme conformation involved
in primary turnover (22). since five-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme is not a significant intermediate following
methylation of wild-type  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme by ch3-h4folate, even during turnover of asp757glu mutant enzyme,
formation of a bond between his759 and the cobalt during
the catalytic cycle must be inherently faster than methyl
transfer, which proceeds with a kobs ≈ 180 s-1 (9). thus,
our ability to detect five-coordinate methylcobalamin during
reactivation, but not during the catalytic cycle, appears to
rest on the coupling of histidine reassociation to a slow
conformational change.
we have used several strategies to populate intermediates
in reductive methylation in order to visualize these transient
enzyme states, including chemical reduction of flavodoxin
and cob(ii)alamin enzyme, as well as mutation of asp757
and his759. it is perhaps worthwhile to consider how the
details of the kinetic mechanism might differ during aerobic
growth of e. coli. under these conditions, ecell ≈ -330 mv
(17, 30), and the predominant oxidation state of flavodoxin
bound to  xxxg1479xxx  is the semiquinone form. since
the flavodoxin semiquinone/oxidized couple has a much
higher midpoint potential (em7 ) -260 mv) than the  xxxd1771xxx /cob(ii)alamin couple, the driving force for electron
transfer is low, and therefore the equilibrium concentration
of  xxxd1771xxx  and the rate of electron transfer will be
significantly decreased. under aerobic physiological conditions, the rate of reductive methylation is predicted to be
primarily limited by the population of  xxxd1771xxx  that can
be generated by electron transfer from bound flavodoxin
semiquinone. optimal rates of reductive methylation are
achieved under anaerobic conditions where flavodoxin hydroquinone serves as electron donor.
among the known vitamin b12-dependent enzymes,  xxxg1479xxx  is unique in its ability to catalyze its own
reactivation. to do so requires the selective use of flavodoxin and  xxxd3156xxx  as substrates with oxidized enzyme,
without allowing these substrates to interfere in the primary
reactions of methionine biosynthesis.  xxxg1479xxx 
appears to maintain a strict separation between conformations
involved in primary turnover and reductive methylation (22).
the manner in which the enzyme is able to detect the
oxidation state of the cobalamin cofactor and to permit or
deny conformational interconversion remains one of the more
mysterious aspects of this enzyme.
