abstract
we report the results of a double-blind, randomized prospective trial on
d2 and  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy and the clinical effects of olanzapine
versus clozapine in a sample of neuroleptic-refractory schizophrenic
patients. receptor occupancy was evaluated in different cortical areas
and in basal ganglia using [18f]fluoro-ethyl-spiperone ([18f]fesp) and
positron emission tomography (pet). a total of 15 neuroleptic-free
patients completed the study undergoing a baseline and a posttreatment pet scan (olanzapine, nine patients, one female; clozapine, six
patients, three female) 8 weeks after starting treatment. pet data were
analysed both by regions of interest and on a voxel-by-voxel basis using
statistical parametric mapping (spm96). olanzapine and clozapine
induced a similar and significant inhibition of [18f]fesp binding index in
the cortex. in the basal ganglia, receptor occupancy was significantly

cerebral d2 and  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy

evidences indicate that the serotonergic system (namely the
 xxxg1113xxx  subtype) may have a relevant role in this disease
(bleich et al., 1988; breier, 1995). this receptor subtype is still
considered a hallmark for the development of new drugs in the
treatment of schizophrenia (gerlach and peacock, 1995; meltzer,
1999), despite an involvement of other 5-ht receptor subtypes,
such as the 5-ht1a subtype, having also been proposed (tauscher
et al., 2002). a pharmacological classification of typical and
atypical antipsychotics was suggested by meltzer on the basis of
the relative potency of different antipsychotics in preventing the
binding of [3h]nmsp to the cortex and basal ganglia of rat brain
in vivo. an in vitro 5-ht2-to- xxxg656xxx  potency ratio higher than
10 has been used to differentiate, on a preclinical basis, between
atypical and typical antipsychotics (meltzer et al., 1989).
the potency of typical and atypical antipsychotics, including
haloperidol, risperidone, clozapine ( xxxd1602xxx ) and olanzapine (olz),
with respect to 5-ht2a and d2-like receptors, has been widely
investigated both in vitro and/or in vivo using emission tomography (nordstrom et al., 1995; kapur et al., 1998; tauscher et al.,
1999; bressan et al., 2001). results of studies with positron
emission tomography (pet) in schizophrenic patients indicate that
the fraction of available 5-ht2a receptors occupied by clinical
doses of several atypical neuroleptics is quite homogeneous, and
generally ranges between 70% and 80%, whereas it is highly
heterogeneous for d2-like receptors.
it has been shown that  xxxd1602xxx  and olz have a partially overlapping profile on 5-ht2, m1 muscarinic and histaminic receptors,
and d1, d2, d3 and d4 dopamine receptors (bymaster et al.,
1999). despite their similarities, results of pet studies with
[11c]raclopride have demonstrated that the in vivo potency of olz
on d2-like receptors is definitely higher than that of  xxxd1602xxx . whereas
clinical doses (75–900 mg/day) of  xxxd1602xxx  occupy a variable fraction
(between 16% and 66%) of the available d2-like receptors, the
d2-like receptor occupancy induced by clinical doses of olz
(5–20 mg/day) ranges between 66% and 80% (nordstrom et al.,
1995; kapur et al., 1998; nordstrom et al., 1998; kapur et al.,
1999; remington and kapur, 1999; tauscher et al., 1999;
meisenzahl et al., 2000; xiberas et al., 2001). for typical neuroleptics a therapeutic window of d2-like receptor occupancy
between 60% and 70% (farde et al., 1992; nordstrom et al., 1993)
has been suggested. by contrast, for atypical neuroleptics, the relationship between clinical efficacy and in vivo receptor occupancy
is still unclear, namely for d2-like dopamine receptors (kapur et
al., 1998). according to kapur et al. (1996) the rate of dissociation
from d2 receptors appears to be of particular relevance in the onset
of extrapyramidal side-effect (eps) and the higher dissociation
rate of atypical neuroleptics has been correlated with the extrapyramidal tolerability of atypical neuroleptics (kapur and seeman,
2001).
although the in vivo potency of atypical neuroleptics, particularly  xxxd1602xxx  and olz, has been investigated in a number of pet
studies, a comparison of the receptor occupancy of these drugs, in
relation to their clinical effects, has not yet been performed in a
randomized, within-patients, controlled, clinical trial. we report
the results of a randomized, double-blind, parallel study evaluating
the pharmacological profiles, clinical efficacy and safety of olz

versus  xxxd1602xxx  in the treatment of treatment-resistant schizophrenic
patients. the outcome measures were the interaction of olz and
 xxxd1602xxx  with 5-ht2 and d2-like receptors in vivo by means of an
[18f]fesp-pet scan and change in clinical rating scores.

materials and methods
pharmacological treatment and study design
a double-blind, parallel study on the clinical efficacy of olz
versus  xxxd1602xxx  and their in vivo occupancy of 5-ht2a and d2-like
receptors was carried out at the istituto scientifico san raffaele
in milan, italy. the study was approved by the local ethical committee. written informed consent was obtained subsequent to
complete oral and written description of the study to the patients.
male and female inpatients aged at least 18 years with a diagnosis
of treatment-refractory schizophrenia were enrolled in the study.
schizophrenia was defined according to dms-iv, while refractoriness was defined as a lack of satisfactory clinical response to two
previous neuroleptic treatments with two different classes of
antipsychotics, with a duration of at least 6 weeks each, given at an
appropriate dosage (at least 500 mg chlorpromazine equivalent).
patients were also required to have a minimum brief psychiatric
rating scale (bprs) global score of 27 as extracted from the
positive and negative syndrome scale (panss; items scored
1–7). patients were considered eligible if they had been neuroleptic free for the last 3 weeks in the case of oral formulations and
for at least 6 months in the case of depot formulations.
before randomization, patients entered a placebo washout of
4–9 days to ensure consistency of eligibility criteria and perform
instrumental evaluations (blood chemistry, haematology, physical
state, electrocardiogram, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging
(mri). during this washout period, patients could be treated with
a rescue medication consisting in lorazepam up to 8 mg/day. only
patients who met all the eligibility criteria, and who had completed
the washout period and not responded to placebo treatment,
entered an 8-week double-blind active treatment period. all
enrolled patients underwent the first pet scan of the protocol
(baseline) before randomization. patients who could be elected
entered the study and were randomly allocated to one treatment
arm (randomization was blind to personnel at the study site, except
in emergency situations requiring patient withdrawal from the
study for a serious adverse event, in which case the blind code was
broken) with a dose titration schedule providing the target dose of
15 mg olz or 300 mg  xxxd1602xxx  at the end of the second week. doses
were divided into two administrations (morning 08.00 h and
evening 08.00 h.
these dosages could be maintained or increased to 20 or
400 mg, respectively, within the fourth week of treatment based on
clinical judgment. patients who tolerated at least 15 mg olz or
300 mg  xxxd1602xxx  continued the study at the highest achieved dose for
the following 4 weeks. a second pet scan (endpoint) was repeated
on the last study day, respectively, after 8 weeks of active treatment
and after 4 weeks of treatment at fixed dosages. the morning dose
of the day in which the pet scan was performed was administered

after the last dose
lorazepam, up to the maximum dose of 8 mg/day was allowed
as emergency treatment in case of agitation and severe anxiety,
while biperiden 2 mg was allowed as emergency treatment of acute
emerging extrapyramidal disorders.
all patients who entered the trial underwent weekly clinical
assessments, including physical examination, vital, blood and
urine parameters, body weight and occurrence of adverse events.
psychopathologic evaluation was performed upon recruitment and
at each weekly visit by a trained psychiatrist by means of the
panss, and the panss-derived bprs. the global clinical judgment on illness severity and change across the study was measured
by means of the clinical global impression checklist at the same
time points. on the same occasions, the occurrence and severity of
eps were assessed using the simpson–angus scale (sas) for
acute extrapyramidal effects and the abnormal involuntary
movement scale (aims) for tardive diskynesia (table 1).

neuroimaging
radiochemistry no-carrier added aqueous [18f]fluoride was
produced with the 18o(p,n) 18f nuclear reaction by proton bombardment of an 18o-enriched water target, with a cti/siemens
rds 112 cyclotron (siemens/cps, knoxville, tn, usa). the
synthesis of [18f]fesp was performed as previously described
(moresco et al., 2000). the tracer was produced with a radiochemical purity higher than 96% and a specific activity ranging
between 100 and 385 mbq/nmol (mean 288 ± 111 mbq/nmol).
the sterility and presence of pyrogens was tested by bacteriological analysis and by the limulus amebocyte lysate test.

pet scans [18f]fesp/pet studies were performed with an
18-ring whole body pet scanner (ge advance; general electric
medical system, milwaukee, wi, usa). patients received an
intravenous injection of approximately 1.07 ± 0.5 nmol [18f]fesp
(mean activity 251.6 mbq; range 107.3–333 mbq). two hours
after injection, a 10-min three-dimensional (3d) scan was carried
out providing simultaneous acquisition of data from 35 transaxial
planes (slice thickness 4.25 mm; axial field of view 15.5). 3d
images were corrected for tissue attenuation with a 10-min
post-injection transmission scan acquired at the end of the
emission study, as previously described (moresco et al., 2000).
images were reconstructed on a 128 × 128 matrix (pixel
size = 1.96) using a hann filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.5
cycle/pixel and a spatial resolution of the image plane of 8 mm
fwhm. reconstructed images were transferred to a sun-sparc
workstation for processing.
data analysis drugs’ effects on cerebral [18f]fesp binding
were evaluated both by a manual analysis of pet images based on
the definition of anatomical regions of interest (rois) and by an
automatic analysis based on the application of the statistical
parametric mapping (spm) (wellcome department of cognitive
neurology, institute of neurology, london, uk) to [18f]fesp
images.
roi: rois were defined on the first pet study (baseline) and then
copied onto the images of the second study (endpoint) after petto-pet realignment using dedicated software (woods et al., 1992).
circular rois of 12 mm diameter were drawn on cortical regions
(frontal, temporal, occipital, parietal and anterior cingulated),
basal ganglia (divided into head of caudate nucleus and putamen),

pituitary gland (1 roi), and cerebellum (3 rois in each hemisphere with exclusion of the vermis). rois were located on three
planes showing the highest radioactivity concentration, for basal
ganglia analysis, and on the plane with the highest radioactivity
concentration in the pituitary. accuracy of co-registration was
verified by checking the correct position of the rois copied from
the reference pet study (baseline) on the images of the second
pet study, and by comparing [18f]fesp binding values of coregistered pet endpoints images with those obtained by direct
drawing on non-co-registered pet endpoint images.
to measure the in vivo binding of [18f]fesp to 5-ht2a
(coenen et al., 1988; jovkar et al., 1991) and d2 receptors (barrio
et al., 1989; wienhard et al., 1990), we used a semiquantitative
method. this method is based on the assessment of specific-tonon-specific binding ratios calculated on pet images acquired at
120–130 min. because the cerebellum has a low density of 5-ht2a
and d2 receptors, it is used as the reference region for the nondisplaceable fraction of [18f]fesp in the brain (i.e. the free plus
the non-specifically bound ligand). a specific binding is defined as
the difference between the radioactivity concentration in the target
areas and that in the cerebellum, and the binding index (bi) of
[18f]fesp to 5-ht2a and d2-like receptors was calculated using:
bi = (area – crb)/crb
where area and crb are the integrated activity concentration
assessed at 120 and 130 min in any of the target region and
cerebellum, respectively.
the analysis applied to the in vivo measurement of [18f]fesp
binding to 5-ht2a and d2 receptors in the cortex and basal ganglia
is generally performed with tracers of reversible binding, with the
obvious limitation of the use of a reference region. it is based
on the assumption that the ratio between the specifically bound
and non-displaceable fractions of the tracer at the point of pseudoequilibrium (i.e. when the rates of ligand-to-receptor binding are in
a steady state) approximates the ratio bmax/kd.
as previously described (moresco et al., 2000), in normal
subjects, this ratio method yields a mean test–retest variability for
[18f]fesp binding lower than 2% in cortical regions and 4% in
basal ganglia. [18f]fesp reproducibility was obtained in a group
of six normal volunteers (one female, mean age 35.3 ± 16.3 years;
range 21–60 years) who underwent two pet scan using the
methodological procedures described above and a second scan
2–3 months after the first study.
receptor occupancy was calculated as the percentage inhibition
of [18f]fesp bi induced by either  xxxd1602xxx  or olz using:
inhibition (%) =
[(fesp – bibaseline – fesp – biendpoint)/(fesp – bibaseline)] × 100
 xxxg1113xxx  occupancy was obtained after the analysis of cortical regions, where [18f]fesp binds predominantly to 5-ht2
receptors (goffinet et al., 1990; barnes and sharp, 1999), while d2
receptor occupancy was evaluated in basal ganglia and the
pituitary gland where the tracer binding reflects dopaminergic
receptors expression (goffinet et al., 1990; hall et al., 1996).

pet-spm: to confirm the results of the roi analysis and to provide results on different brain regions, an spm analysis was also
performed using spm96 (friston et al., 1991; worsley et al., 1992;
kiebel et al., 1999).
each patient [18f]fesp image was normalized to an
[18f]fesp-pet template previously built in our centre. this template was based on pet and mri images of 10 normal volunteers
normalized into the talairach and tournoux stereotactic space
(talairach and tournoux, 1988) by the following steps: mri
images (t1-weighed) were co-registered to pet images using an
isocontour matching algorithm (pietrzyk et al., 1994); eventually,
each individual mri was normalized to the t1-weighed mri
template in the talairach and tournoux space; the transformation
matrix obtained was applied to the co-registered pet image; the
normalized pet images were divided on a pixel-by-pixel basis by
a mean cerebellar radioactivity value to transform distribution
images into binding related images, and finally the normalized
pet images were smoothed with a gaussian kernel (8 mm fwhm)
and averaged to obtain a mean image volume representing the
[18f]fesp template.
[18f]fesp pet images for patients were divided on a voxel-byvoxel basis by cerebellar radioactivity concentration (using cerebellar values derived from rois analysis) to obtain binding
images, and were eventually normalized to the [18f]fesp-pet
template and smoothed as described above.
statistical analysis in spm included analysis of t-maps
[spm(t)] to evaluate differences between conditions (baseline
versus endpoint within the olz and  xxxd1602xxx  groups) and drugs’
effects ( xxxd1602xxx  versus olz). spm(t) maps were transformed in
normal distribution z-maps [spm(z)] with a threshold of p < 0.01
(uncorrected).
regional differences of drug effect within the striatum, were
evaluated also by rois analysis on coronal brain section of
normalized [18f]fesp binding images. rois (circular) were
defined on five coronal section orthogonal to ap-cp lines starting
from the head of the caudate (fig. 1). the head of caudate nucleus
was divided in two portions: anterior (section 1 and 2; one roi
each plane and brain side) and posterior (section 3 and 4; one roi
each plane and brain side). the putamen was divided in four
portions according to a rostro–caudal direction starting from
section 2 (one roi each plane and brain side). additional rois
were also defined on the ventral portion of the rostral putamen
(section 2 and 3; one roi).

statistical analysis
clinical data clinical and psychopathological changes were
evaluated by comparing basal and final scores of the clinical scales
above mentioned of completers. safety and tolerability of both
drugs were evaluated by incidence of adverse events.
change in both continuous and categorical data was evaluated
by analysis of variance (anova), adopting treatment, gender,
diagnosis and age at first diagnosis as independent or grouping
variables. the univariate analysis of all relevant clinical parameters was accomplished with a two-tailed t-test for independent
samples, student’s test, the chi-square test with yate’s correction

considered statistically significant.
pet-rois regional baseline values of [18f]fesp bi of patients
who completed the study were compared with those of dropout
patients using a mann–whitney test for unpaired data (itt analysis). the test was also used to compare baseline values of olzversus  xxxd1602xxx -treated patients. differences between baseline versus
endpoint within either olz- or  xxxd1602xxx -treated patients were evaluated using a wilcoxon sum-rank test for paired data. differences in
drug effects were evaluated by means of a mann–whitney test,
comparing the relative (endpoint minus baseline) differences in
regional [18f]fesp binding. statistical analysis was performed by
means of the statistica 5.5 (statsoft inc., tulsa, ok, usa)
program. parametric bi images were analysed with the statistical
routine included in spm96 as already described above.

results
although a total of 24 patients were enrolled, only 23 entered the
trial because one patient did not comply with the placebo washout

period. the study population consisted of 16 males and seven
females. eleven patients were randomized to olz and 12 to  xxxd1602xxx .
of the 11 patients assigned to olz, nine completed the entire
observation period whereas, of the 12 patients assigned to  xxxd1602xxx ,
only six completed the observation period. therefore, the statistical analysis was focused on a total of 15 patients (nine olz; six
 xxxd1602xxx ), whose main baseline and endpoint demographic and psychiatric features are shown in table 1.
no statistically significant difference was observed with regard
to patients’ mean age (olz versus  xxxd1602xxx  34.1 ± 7.6 years versus
38.3 ± 9.1 years, respectively; p = 0.35), gender ratio (olz versus
 xxxd1602xxx  8 : 1 versus 3 : 3, respectively; p = 0.75). a slight but significant difference in baseline mean body weight was detected (olz
versus  xxxd1602xxx  78.5 ± 14.4 kg versus 65.5 ± 9.3 kg; p = 0.05). no
statistically significant differences were observed between the two
populations in terms of baseline mean panss scores (olz versus
 xxxd1602xxx  94.7 ± 13 versus 100.5 ± 15.1, respectively; p = 0.43); mean
positive panss scores (olz versus  xxxd1602xxx  16.5 ± 5.1 versus
18.2 ± 3.3, respectively; p = 0.48); mean negative panss scores
(olz versus  xxxd1602xxx  24.1 ± 4.6 versus 24.2 ± 4.6, respectively;
p = 0.96); mean bprs scores (olz versus  xxxd1602xxx  51.6 ± 7.4 versus

0; p = 0.22). no statistically significant difference was found also
for cgi baseline scores (olz versus  xxxd1602xxx  4.8 ± 0.7 versus
5.3 ± 0.5, respectively, p = 0.1) (table 1).
patients randomized to olz received a mean dose of 18.3 ±
0.5 mg/day (with a mean of 0.23 mg/kg per patient), whereas
patients randomized to  xxxd1602xxx  received a mean dose of 325.4 ±
9.7 mg/day (with a mean of 4.9 mg/kg per patient).
the analysis of variance revealed that mean panss scores did
not change significantly from baseline to endpoint between the two
treatment groups (p = 0.4; f = 0.85). namely, panss scores
varied from 94.7 ± 13 to 65 ± 20.9 in the olz-treated group and
from 100.5 ± 15.1 to 55.8 ± 18.9 in the  xxxd1602xxx -treated group. mean
positive panss scores showed a significantly greater reduction
from baseline to endpoint among the  xxxd1602xxx -treated group (from
18.2 ± 3.3 to 9.5 ± 3.3) than among the olz-treated group (from
16.5 ± 5.1 to 11.2 ± 1.8) (p = 0.0001; f = 0.067). by contrast, mean
negative panss scores did not show a significantly different
reduction of scores from baseline to endpoint between the two
groups (from 24.1 ± 4.6 to 17.3 ± 3.4 in the olz group and from
24.2 ± 4.6 to 18.9 ± 5.6 in the  xxxd1602xxx  group) (p = 0.5; f = 1). mean
reduction of bprs scores was not significantly from baseline to
endpoint between the two groups (from 51.6 ± 7.4 to 44.3 ± 6.5
in the olz group and from 56.0 ± 7.8 to 48.7 ± 5.4 in the  xxxd1602xxx 
group) (p = 0.19; f = 0.56); similarly, mean anchored bprs scores
did not show a significant change from baseline to endpoint
between the two groups (p = 0.08; f = 0.39).there was a numerical but not statistically significant difference in dropout rates
between olz and  xxxd1602xxx  patients (18.2% versus 50%, respectively;
p = 0.19).
side-effects were significantly more frequent in the  xxxd1602xxx  group
(91.7% versus 44.4%, p = 0.04). trial discontinuations due to
severe side-effects and related to treatment were five in the  xxxd1602xxx 
group (one acute toxic hepatitis, one disorientation, one leucopoenia

with agranulocytosis, one severe hypotension, one lypothimia),
and one in the olz group (increased cpk) (p = 0.05). one patient
dropped out in the  xxxd1602xxx  group for perceived lack of efficacy and
one patient in the olz group broke a foot, an event unrelated to
treatment but which required trial withdrawal for surgical needs.
both agranulocytosis and acute toxic hepatitis were amenable to
medical treatment after drug discontinuation.
extrapyramidal tolerability was similar in the two groups
because mean aims and sas scores were not significantly affected
by either treatment (table 1). it should be noted that no patient
showed any eps at the end of the treatment, but also that no patient
showed abnormal movements at any time as recorded by the aims
both groups presented an increase in baseline mean body
weight, with olz-treated patients scoring higher weekly increments. however, this group presented with significantly higher
baseline body weights and the analysis of change failed to reveal
statistically significant differences between the two groups from
baseline to endpoint (p = 0.73).
no differences in baseline values of [18f]fesp bi were detected
between: (i) patients who completed the study and dropout patients
(p > 0.1 in all areas examined) and (ii) between patients assigned
to olz treatment and patients assigned to  xxxd1602xxx  (p > 0.1 in all areas
examined). the results of occupancy studies are summarized in
table 2. in the cortex, where tracer uptake is mainly related to
5-ht2a receptors, repeated administration of olz or  xxxd1602xxx  induced
a significant reduction of [18f]fesp bi (p < 0.005 and p < 0.05 for
olz and  xxxd1602xxx , respectively). in most cortical regions, receptor
occupancy was slightly higher in the olz-treated group, although
differences between treatments were not statistically significant
(p > 0.1). by contrast, in the basal ganglia, where tracer binding is
mostly due to d2-like receptors, receptor occupancy was definitely
higher after olz than after  xxxd1602xxx  (p < 0.005). finally, in the
pituitary gland, an area rich in d2-like receptors, no significant
differences were observed between olz and  xxxd1602xxx  (p = 0.55).
similar results were obtained using automatic statistic analysis
(spm96). both drug significantly reduced [18f]fesp binding

(p threshold = 0.01) all over the cortex, in the basal ganglia and in
the pituitary gland. however, in the basal ganglia, and in particular
in the anterior portion of the putamen, olz effect was definitely
higher. (fig. 2). the presence of a rostro–caudal gradient in drug
effect differences was confirmed by roi analysis on coronal brain
slices. in particular, olz occupancy was significantly higher in the
anterior portions of the caudate nucleus (mean difference after
olz: 2.04 ± 0.68; mean difference after  xxxd1602xxx : 1.24 ± 0.51;
p = 0.01) and putamen (put1: mean difference after olz:

discussion
the activity of olz and  xxxd1602xxx  on 5-ht2 and d2 receptors in vivo

has been evaluated in several studies using [11c]raclopride for
d2-like receptors and spiperone derivatives for 5-ht2a (nordstrom
et al., 1995; kapur et al., 1999; meisenzahl et al., 2000; schmitt
et al., 2002; de haan et al., 2003). however, the olz and  xxxd1602xxx 
pharmacological profiles for 5-ht2 and d2 receptors and their
clinical efficacy have never been evaluated in the same experimental study.
the average dose of olanzapine in european countries was
found to be 14.5 ± 5.1 mg/day in the rodos study by kasper
et al. (2001), while the average dose of clozapine in european
trials, as reviewed by fleischhacker et al. (1994) was found to be
283.7 mg/day. doses in this study are thus comparable to the average effective doses used in the treatment of schizophrenia in
european countries, and this is the only way a relative comparison
can be made. drug equivalency is much more difficult to apply
among atypical antipsychotics compared to typical antipsychotics
because of the many receptor differences and the relative contribution to clinical outcome.

cerebral d2 and  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy

refractory schizophrenia are strongly limited by the low number of
completers, and this explains why no conclusion can be made by
looking at clinical data. nor can the data be referred to the treatment of resistant schizophrenia, as intended using kane’s criteria
of resistance, which was not used in this study. in our small
sample, completers analysis describes a similar effect of olz and
 xxxd1602xxx  in changing the main global parameters of clinical efficacy,
the panss total score and the negative symptoms subscale, while
 xxxd1602xxx  was superior in changing the panss positive subscale score.
nevertheless, a number of interesting results can be discussed
when occupancy and tolerability data are focused.
as previously mentioned, extrapyramidal tolerability was
favourable and similar in the two groups, despite the significantly
higher d2 occupancy induced by olz in the striatum. this latter
result supports the hypothesis that 5-ht2 blockade per se might be
relevant in protecting against d2 antagonism-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (stockmeier et al., 1993; kapur, 1996). however,
the involvement of 5-ht2a receptors in eps was recently revised
and criticized (nyberg et al., 1999; kapur et al., 2000) and the
major role of a fast dissociation rate from d2 receptors, rather then
interaction with other types of receptors, was proposed on the basis
of clinical, pharmacological and preclinical results (seeman and
tallerico, 1998). this issue has been revised more recently by
seeman and westerink (kapur and seeman, 2001; westerink,
2002).
the differences in global occupancy of striatal d2-like receptors is not surprising in the light of the higher affinity displayed by
olz. however, the higher occupancy of olz was confined to the
anterior portion of the putamen, and not the posterior portion or in
the pituitary, and this might explain the lack of extrapyramidal
symptoms observed in olz-treated patients. the mesolimbic and
the nigro-striatal dopamine system are anatomically and neurochemically separated within the basal ganglia of primate brain. the
mesolimbic system acts mainly on d3 dopamine receptors, which
are expressed along a ventro–dorsal gradient with the highest
concentration in the nucleus accumbens. d2-like receptors, which
are the major target of nigro-striatal dopamine neurones, display
a rostro–caudal increasing gradient, involving both the caudate
and putamen (piggott et al., 1999). in our study, we observed the
smallest differences in receptor occupancy in brain regions with a
predominant expression of d2 receptors (i.e. the posterior putamen
and the pituitary gland) (mengod et al., 1992; piggott et al., 1999).
seeman and tallerico (1998) showed that, at a therapeutic concentration, various antipsychotic drugs, including  xxxd1602xxx  and olz,
occupy a similar fraction of d2 receptors but not d3 or d4 receptors. thus, they proposed that the blockade of the d2 subtype
receptors is an essential requirement for antipsychotic efficacy.
however, d2 and d3 receptors are co-localized in different sensory
regions, suggesting ‘a function convergence’ of the two receptors
subtypes (joyce and gurevich, 1999). thus, whether the anatomical compartmentalization of d2-like receptors influences the
clinical effects of olz and  xxxd1602xxx  remains a matter of further investigation, requiring the development of tracers specific for the
different subtypes of d2-like receptors. this is of particular
relevance in view of the recent findings suggesting a link between
 xxxg657xxx  gene polymorphism and susceptibility to

antipychotic-induced movement disorders (eichhammer et al.,
2000; ozdemir et al., 2001; lerer et al., 2002).
another interesting finding is the similar occupancy found in
the pituitary gland. only few data on the measurement of pituitary
d2 receptors in vivo have been published. the limited size of the
pituitary leads to an underestimation of tracer binding because of
partial volume effects. for this reason, the pituitary can only be
visualized using tracers with a high signal to noise ratio, as is the
case with fesp, or high affinity benzamides (pirker et al., 1996).
the lack of a difference in pituitary receptor occupancy is agreement with the similar effect on prolactin increase and normalization induced by olz and  xxxd1602xxx  (crawford et al., 1997; markianos
et al., 1999; turrone et al., 2002).
our results raise numerous questions concerning the role of
striatal d2-like receptors in the clinical and tolerability profile of
atypical antipsychotics and whether other molecular mechanisms
(namely the receptor distribution within the rostro–caudal axis of
the striatum) should be considered. most pet studies on the inhibition of d2-like receptors induced by atypical neuroleptics have
been performed using pet tracers that do not allow measurement
of drug interaction in vivo within the mesocortical dopaminergic
system, and this network may be crucial for the clinical activity of
atypical neuroleptics. this issue is currently under evaluation using
new high affinity benzamides that allow measurement of cortical
d2-like dopamine receptors in vivo (pilowsky, 2001; talvik et al.,
2001; xiberas et al., 2001).
for drug occupancy evaluation, a within patients study design
was selected. the advantage of this strategy is that drug occupancy
is calculated within each subject, thus avoiding errors due to a
modification in receptors levels induced by previous long-term
treatments with antipsychotics (silvestri et al., 2000). however,
although we selected a group of patients in washout from at least
3 weeks and with an additional 7–9 days of placebo, one limit of
this strategy may be the underestimation of occupancy values due
to a residual effect of previous treatment. moreover, another limiting
fact is the failure to measure the plasma levels of the active drugs.
using [18f]fesp, we found lower values of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy compared to other studies. due to their pharmacological
profiles and the differences in regional distribution of d2 and
5-ht2a receptors, spiperone derivatives may potentially be used
for the simultaneous measurement of the effect of atypical neuroleptics on both receptor populations. the density of 5-ht2a receptors in the human cortex is approximately 25-fold greater than that
of d2 receptors. in the frontal cortex, binding of [11c]-n-methylspiperone to d2-like receptors in vivo has been reported to be less
than 10% of the total binding, or even negligible (frost et al., 1987;
nordstrom et al., 1995). in vitro, [18f]fesp displays a high
affinity for d2-like and 5-ht2 receptors (0.44 and 0.57 nm, respectively), a low affinity for alpha1 adrenergic receptors, and negligible
binding to other receptors (goffinet et al., 1990). pet studies
performed in vivo have demonstrated that [18f]fesp binds with
high affinity to d2 receptors in the striatum and to 5-ht2 receptors
in the cortex (jovkar et al., 1991). among 5-ht2 receptors, the
selectivity of [18f]fesp has not yet been reported. however, its
cerebral distribution resembles that of 5-ht2a receptors uniformly
distributed in the cerebral cortex (barnes and sharp, 1999).

cerebral d2 and  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy

thus, based on its pharmacological properties, we used
[18f]fesp as a tracer for the evaluation of 5-ht2 and d2 receptors
in a single pet scan. this strategy allowed the simultaneous measurement of 5-ht2-to-d2 occupancy ratios within the same patients
without exceeding radiation exposure and with simplification of
the experimental protocol. however, the specific pharmacological
profile must be considered when the results obtained from pet
studies with spiperone derivatives are compared with those
obtained with [11c]raclopride. a lower sensitivity of spiperone
derivatives in the evaluation of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy is generally
reported. (goyer et al., 1996; hagberg et al., 1998). in a study with
[11c]nmsp, goyer et al. (1996) found occupancy values of
15–34% in a group of schizophrenic patients receiving treatment
with 300–900 mg  xxxd1602xxx , which is lower than that found with
[11c]raclopride. several factors, including affinity (seeman and
van tol, 1995), lipophilicity, interaction with different portions
of d2 receptors, or a different selectivity for the subclasses of
d2 receptors (i.e. d2s, d2 l, d3 and d4) may account for the
differences observed.
in addition, the pharmacological profile of spiperone derivatives must also be considered for cortical areas when occupancy
values are compared with these obtained with selective 5-ht2a
receptor tracers such as [11c]mdl 100907 (ito et al., 1998).
in conclusion, as previously reported by other authors, repeated
treatment with olz promoted a four-fold inhibition of striatal
d2-like receptors but a similar fraction of occupancy on cortical
5-ht2 receptors. however, the higher occupancy of olz was
confined in a  xxxg657xxx  subtype rich region such as the anterior
portion of the putamen. the regional selectivity observed could be
related to the lack of extrapyramidal symptoms observed in olztreated patients at the doses used in the study. however, whether
the neurochemical and anatomical compartmentalization of d2like receptors and the differences in regional occupancies observed
in the present study influence the clinical effects of olz and  xxxd1602xxx ,
remains a matter for further investigation, requiring the development of tracers specific for the different subtypes of d2-like
receptors.
