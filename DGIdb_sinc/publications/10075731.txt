bition of platelet activation, and regulation of endothelial cell
permeability and adhesivity (1– 4). no is generated from the
conversion of l-arginine to  xxxd2429xxx  by the enzymatic action
of an nadph-dependent no synthase (nos) that requires
tetrahydrobiopterin, fad, and fmn as cofactors (5). the endothelial nos isoform ( xxxg1579xxx ) is constitutively expressed and
is activated upon an increase of intracellular calcium following
cell stimulation with receptor-dependent stimuli such as
thrombin and bradykinin or with receptor-independent stimuli
like calcium ionophore (6).
since no interferes with key processes in atherogenesis (7),
a lack of no might promote the development of atherosclerosis.
indeed, clinical studies have confirmed an impairment of vascular no synthesis in patients with atherosclerosis or with
increased atherogenic risk factors (8). the dysfunction of the
endothelial no pathway may involve impaired signal transduction mechanisms, decreased  xxxg1579xxx  activity, reduced intracellular availability of l-arginine, or increased inactivation of
no by superoxide anions or oxidized low density lipoproteins
(7, 8). accordingly, initial therapeutic strategies for an improvement of endothelial vasodilator function include the application of  xxxg36xxx  inhibitors that
stimulate no synthesis through the local accumulation of bradykinin as well as the supplementation of l-arginine and the
use of antioxidants (7, 9).
 xxxd228xxx  is the most important water-soluble antioxidant in human plasma (10). it effectively scavenges superoxide
and other reactive oxygen species and protects lipids against
peroxidation (11, 12).  xxxd228xxx  is thought to play a protective role in atherogenesis since epidemiological studies have
demonstrated that plasma  xxxd228xxx  levels are inversely
related to the mortality from coronary heart disease (13). moreover, a number of conditions known to be associated with an
increased risk for atherosclerosis have been linked with lower
plasma levels of  xxxd228xxx  (14 –17). recently, several studies have shown that an acute application of  xxxd228xxx  enhanced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with
diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or chronic heart failure and in cigarette smokers
(18 –23). these findings were attributed to the radical scavenging ability of  xxxd228xxx  which may protect no from inactivation. so far, however, direct effects of  xxxd228xxx  on endothelial no synthesis have not been examined.
the present study was designed to investigate whether
 xxxd228xxx  affects no production in human endothelial cells.
the synthesis of no was measured as the formation of its
co-product citrulline and as the accumulation of its effector
molecule cgmp after stimulating ascorbate-pretreated cells
with the calcium-increasing agonists  xxxd2379xxx  and thrombin.
additionally, the influence of  xxxd228xxx  on calcium-dependent citrulline formation in cell lysates and on the content of
 xxxg1579xxx  protein was investigated. we report that  xxxd228xxx

 xxxd228xxx  has been shown to enhance impaired
endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with
atherosclerosis by a mechanism that is thought to involve protection of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) from inactivation
by free oxygen radicals. the present study in human
endothelial cells from umbilical veins and coronary arteries investigates whether l- xxxd228xxx  additionally
affects cellular no synthesis. endothelial cells were incubated for 24 h with 0.1–100 mm  xxxd228xxx  and were
subsequently stimulated for 15 min with  xxxd2379xxx  (2
mm) or thrombin (1 unit/ml) in the absence of extracellular ascorbate. ascorbate pretreatment led to a 3-fold
increase of the cellular production of no measured as
the formation of its co-product citrulline and as the
accumulation of its effector molecule cgmp. the effect
was saturated at 100 mm and followed a similar kinetics
as seen for the uptake of ascorbate into the cells. the
investigation of the precursor molecule l-gulonolactone
and of different  xxxd228xxx  derivatives suggests that
the enediol structure of ascorbate is essential for its
effect on no synthesis.  xxxd228xxx  did not induce the
expression of the no synthase (nos) protein nor enhance the uptake of the nos substrate l-arginine into
endothelial cells. the  xxxd228xxx  effect was minimal
when the citrulline formation was measured in cell lysates from ascorbate-pretreated cells in the presence of
known cofactors for nos activity. however, when the
cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin was omitted from the assay, a similar potentiating effect of ascorbate pretreatment as seen in intact cells was demonstrated, suggesting that  xxxd228xxx  may either enhance the
availability of tetrahydrobiopterin or increase its affinity for the endothelial nos. our data suggest that intracellular  xxxd228xxx  enhances no synthesis in endothelial cells and that this may explain, in part, the
beneficial vascular effects of  xxxd228xxx .

 xxxd228xxx  potentiates no synthesis
that this action may be an important characteristic of this
agent to exert its beneficial effects in the vascular system.
experimental procedures

line production was calculated from the difference in radioactivity from
 xxxd2379xxx - or thrombin-stimulated cells and the corresponding unstimulated cells and was expressed in pmol/mg cell protein. basal
citrulline synthesis was determined from the l-name (1 mm, 30 min
preincubation)-inhibitable radioactivity in unstimulated cells and was
not always detectable.
determination of cgmp—huvec monolayers were incubated for 30
min in  xxxd1728xxx  containing 0.25% hsa and 0.5 mm  xxxd2388xxx . subsequently, the cells were stimulated with 2 mm  xxxd2379xxx  or
1 unit/ml thrombin for 15 min. the reaction was stopped with 96%
ethanol. when the ethanol had evaporated, 0.3 ml of buffer (50 mm tris,
4 mm edta (ph 7.5)) was applied. the cgmp content of 100 ml of
cellular extract was measured by radioimmunoassay following the instructions of the manufacturer. the intracellular cgmp concentration
was expressed in pmol/mg cell protein. the agonist-induced cgmp
production was determined from the difference of cgmp content in
 xxxd2379xxx - or thrombin-stimulated cells and the corresponding unstimulated cells.
[14c] xxxd228xxx  uptake in endothelial cells—huvec were incubated in culture medium containing 100 mm [14c] xxxd228xxx  (16
mci/mmol). after various times, incubations were stopped by washing
the cells with cold hepes buffer (ph 7.4) containing 100 mm phloretin
which had been shown to prevent the efflux of [14c]dehydroascorbic acid
(25). huvec were lysed with solubilization buffer; an aliquot of the
lysate was taken to determine the protein content (26), and the radioactivity of the remaining sample was measured by liquid scintillation
counting.
[14c]arginine uptake into endothelial cells—huvec were incubated in culture medium containing 335 mm l-[14c]arginine (3 mci/
mmol). after various times, incubations were stopped by washing the
cells with cold hepes buffer (ph 7.4) containing 5 mm l-arginine. the
solubilization of the cells and the measurement of radioactivity were
performed as described above.
sds electrophoresis and immunoblotting—huvec were detached
by trypsin/edta and suspended in a small volume of hepes/sorbitol
buffer (ph 7.4). for preparation of subcellular fractions, cell suspensions were sonicated on ice and centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 3 g
and 4 °c. proteins were solubilized by boiling the cells as well as the
soluble and particulate fractions in laemmli sample buffer. the samples were separated by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sdspage) on 7% gels (50 mg of protein per lane), blotted onto nitrocellulose
membranes, and subsequently subjected to immunostaining with primary antibodies against human  xxxg1579xxx  or against murine inos (1:250,
1.5 h). after an incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody (1:1000, 1.5 h), visualization of nos was achieved using the
ecl technique.
flow cytometric measurement of  xxxg1579xxx  protein—huvec were
fixed with 0.5% formaldehyde in pbs for 2.5 min, dissociated by a
combination of trypsinization (2 min) and scraping, and finally suspended in pbs containing 0.1% hsa. samples of 5 3 105 cells/50 ml
were labeled with a monoclonal antibody to  xxxg1579xxx  (1:25, 30 min) in the
presence of 0.06% saponin (w/v) and subsequently incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse igg(h 1 l) (1:50, 30
min). the cell-associated fluorescence of 5000 cells per sample was
determined in a facscan flow cytometer (becton/dickinson) using the
cellquest software and reported as mean fluorescence intensity in the
fl1 channel. the mean fluorescence intensity values were corrected for
nonspecific staining. calibration of the flow cytometer and calculation
of the numbers of  xxxg1579xxx  molecules per cell from the corrected mean
fluorescence intensity values were done using dako fluorospheres.
metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of  xxxg1579xxx —huvec
were incubated with 100 mm  xxxd228xxx  for 6 h. subsequently, 50 mci
of tran35s-label reagent in methionine-free rpmi medium containing
100 mm ascorbate was added for 3 h. untreated control cells were
processed in parallel. the labeled cells were lysed by the addition of
hepes buffer (ph 7.4) containing 0.5% triton x-100, 0.05% sds, and
protease inhibitors (1 mm pmsf, 0.6 mm leupeptin, 0.025 mm pepstatin). immunoprecipitation was performed with a monoclonal anti- xxxg1579xxx  antibody (8 mg per 500 mg of lysate protein, 4 °c, 2 h) which was
followed by a 1-h incubation with anti-mouse agarose. the precipitates
were washed with pbs containing 0.1% triton x-100, 0.1% sds, and
0.2% hsa and eluted by boiling in laemmli sample buffer. the samples
were separated, blotted, and immunostained as described above. the
autoradiography was performed with hyperfilm bmax at 220 °c for 2–10
days.

human serum proteins was from dianova (hamburg, germany);
nadph, tetrahydrobiopterin, and l-nitroarginine methyl ester (lname) were from alexis corp. (läufelfingen, switzerland). endothelial cell growth supplement, peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse igg (fabspecific), anti-mouse agarose, fad, fmn, calmodulin,  xxxd2379xxx ,

(deisenhofen, germany).
the composition of the hepes buffer (ph 7.4) was as follows (in mm):
10 hepes, 145 nacl, 5 kcl, 1  xxxd2534xxx , 10 glucose, 1.5 cacl2. hepes
homogenization buffer (ph 7.2) consisted of (in mm) 20 hepes, 0.5
edta, 0.5 egta, 1 dithiothreitol (dtt) 1 pmsf, 0.001 pepstatin, and
0.002 leupeptin. hepes/sorbitol buffer (ph 7.4) contained (in mm) 10
hepes, 340 sorbitol, 1 edta, 2 dtt, 1 pmsf, 0.6 leupeptin, and 0.025
pepstatin. the composition of the solubilization buffer was 100 mm
naoh, 2% na2co3, and 1% sds.
cell cultures—human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (huvec) were prepared with 0.05% collagenase, and primary coronary
artery endothelial cells (caec) were obtained from clonetics (san
diego, ca). cells were cultured in 75-cm2 plastic flasks in  xxxd1728xxx  containing 15% fetal calf serum, 5% human serum, and 7.5 mg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement. confluent cultures were detached by
trypsin/edta and plated on 30-mm diameter wells for the purpose of
cgmp determination and on 60-mm diameter dishes for the investigation of the other parameters. experiments were carried out with monolayers of the first to second passage (huvec) or third to fourth passage
(caec).
experimental incubations—preincubations of huvec or caec with
l- xxxd228xxx , l-gulonolactone, dehydroascorbic acid, and different
 xxxd228xxx  derivatives were performed in culture medium for 1–24 h.
the low content of  xxxd228xxx  in  xxxd1728xxx  (0.3 mm) was neglected since
the liquid media were stored between 1 and 3 weeks before use, and the
compound is extremely labile in solution. l- xxxd228xxx  stock solution
was freshly prepared in  xxxd1728xxx  and neutralized with 200 mm naoh
before the addition to the cells. stock solutions of the other compounds
were prepared in  xxxd1728xxx . stimulation of cells with  xxxd2379xxx  or thrombin was performed in the absence of  xxxd228xxx  or its derivatives.
 xxxd2379xxx  was dissolved at 1 mm in me2so and stored at 220 °c until
use. the final concentration of me2so did not exceed 0.1%, and control
cells received the same volume addition of solvent. the viability of cells
was determined by trypan blue exclusion and ranged from 95 to 98%
under the different conditions described. none of the tested compounds
altered the growth behavior of endothelial cells as evaluated by [3h]thymidine incorporation and by cell counting.
measurement of citrulline synthesis—citrulline synthesis was
measured by a modification of a previously described technique (24).
cell monolayers were incubated at 37 °c for 30 min in 1.5 ml of hepes
buffer (ph 7.4) containing 0.25% hsa. 10 mm l-[3h]arginine (0.33
ci/mmol) were added to each dish, and 1 min later cells were stimulated
with 2 mm  xxxd2379xxx  or 1 unit/ml thrombin. after 15 min the reaction
was stopped with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) containing 5 mm
l-arginine and 4 mm edta, and the cells were denaturated with 96%
ethanol. after evaporation, the soluble cellular components were dissolved in 20 mm hepes-na (ph 5.5) and applied to 2-ml columns of
dowex ag-50w-x8 (na1 form). the [3h]citrulline content of the eluate

l-[ c]arginine (303 mci/mmol), 3 mm tetrahydrobiopterin, 1 mm fad, 1
mm fmn, 100 nm calmodulin, 2 mm nadph, and 2.5 mm cacl2. incubations without calcium served as a blank. in some experiments tetrahydrobiopterin, fad, fmn, or calmodulin were omitted from the test.
after a 15-min incubation at 37 °c, the reaction was stopped by adding
hepes-na (20 mm, ph 5.5) containing 2 mm edta, and the reaction
mixture was applied to 2-ml columns of dowex ag-50w-x8 (na1 form).
the [3h]citrulline content of the eluate was quantified by liquid scintillation counting and after correction for basal values expressed in
pmol/mg lysate protein. in previous experiments we have demonstrated
that citrulline synthesis is a function of lysate protein up to 2.5 mg/ml
and is linear for at least 20 min. furthermore, half-maximal citrulline
formation was detectable at 3.4 6 0.3 mm l-arginine (results not shown).
protein determination—after lysing the cells with solubilization
buffer or with laemmli sample buffer, proteins were measured according to lowry et al. (26). protein determination in cell lysates containing
dtt was performed according to bradford using the bio-rad protein
microassay.
statistical analysis—each experimental point was performed in duplicate. all data are given as means 6 s.e. of three to six independent
experiments. to determine the statistical significance of the described
results, analysis of variance with bonferroni’s correction for multiple
comparisons or student’s t test for unpaired data were performed. a p
value of ,0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
results

effect of  xxxd228xxx  on citrulline and cgmp formation in
endothelial cells—no production upon endothelial cell stimulation is accompanied by an increased synthesis of citrulline
which is produced stoichiometrically with no, and by an accumulation of intracellular cgmp which is generated when no
activates the soluble  xxxg1587xxx  of the cells. accordingly,
both parameters indicate the formation of no. stimulation of
huvec with  xxxd2379xxx  led to a citrulline formation of 37 6 4
pmol/mg cellular protein (n 5 6). 24 h pretreatment of huvec
with 0.1–100 mm  xxxd228xxx  potentiated  xxxd2379xxx -stimulated citrulline production in a dose-dependent manner up to
73 6 19 pmol/mg (fig. 1). similar results were obtained when
huvec were stimulated with thrombin although the thrombin
response was generally lower. additionally,  xxxd228xxx  potentiated  xxxd2379xxx -induced citrulline formation in caec up
to 2.3-fold (fig. 1). the agonist-induced citrulline formation in

were stimulated for 15 min with  xxxd2379xxx  or thrombin in  xxxd1728xxx  containing 0.5 mm  xxxd2388xxx  (30 min preincubation). the
accumulated cgmp was measured in cellular extracts by radioimmunoassay. data are shown as agonist-induced cgmp production calculated from the difference in cgmp content from stimulated and unstimulated cells and expressed in pmol/mg cell protein (mean 6 s.e.,

was completely inhibited when cells were preincubated with 1
mm of the nos inhibitor l-name 30 min before stimulation.
the basal citrulline synthesis was generally lower than 5
pmol/mg protein and was not enhanced by ascorbate
incubation.
the effect of  xxxd228xxx  on  xxxd2379xxx -stimulated citrulline
synthesis was saturable since concentrations above 100 mm did
not induce further amplification. 24 h of preincubation of huvec with 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mm ascorbate followed by a
stimulation with  xxxd2379xxx  caused a citrulline production (in
pmol/mg cell protein) of 84 6 6, 81 6 8, 88 6 10, and 86 6 6,
respectively (n 5 3).
in addition to citrulline formation,  xxxd2379xxx  and thrombin
induced an accumulation of intracellular cgmp in huvec of
5.4 6 1.3 pmol/mg cell protein and 2.8 6 1.3 pmol/mg, respectively (n 5 6). 24 h preincubation of huvec with 0.1–100 mm
 xxxd228xxx  potentiated both  xxxd2379xxx - and thrombin-stimulated cgmp formation up to 2.9- and 2.7-fold, respectively,
thus confirming the effects on citrulline production (fig. 2).
again, the agonist-stimulated cgmp increase in both untreated and  xxxd228xxx -preincubated cells was entirely
blocked by a 30-min preincubation with 1 mm l-name.  xxxd228xxx  did not affect the basal cgmp formation that was 1.9 6
0.2 pmol/mg in control cells and 2.0 6 0.4 pmol/mg in cells
pretreated with 100 mm  xxxd228xxx  for 24 h (n 5 20).
time dependence of the  xxxd228xxx  effect—preincubation
of huvec with 100 mm l- xxxd228xxx  for different periods
followed by stimulation with  xxxd2379xxx  revealed that the potentiating effect on citrulline and cgmp formation was related
to the incubation time. a maximal amplification of ionomycininduced citrulline and cgmp production was achieved after an
18-h pretreatment (fig. 3). after a 6-h preincubation, 46 and
30% of the maximal effects on citrulline and cgmp synthesis,
respectively, were measured, whereas a 1-h treatment with
 xxxd228xxx  did not cause any potentiation of calcium-dependent citrulline and cgmp formation (fig. 3).
transport of  xxxd228xxx  into endothelial cells—to measure the [14c] xxxd228xxx  uptake into huvec, cells were incubated with 100 mm [14c]ascorbate (16 mci/mmol) for 1–24 h.
about 17, 36, 47, and 75% of the maximal  xxxd228xxx  uptake
were achieved after 1, 2, 3, and 6 h, respectively, while saturation occurred between 12 and 24 h (fig. 4). at 24 h the

hepes buffer (ph 7.4) containing 1.5 mm calcium and 10 mm l-[3h]arginine (0.33 ci/mmol). the generated [3h]citrulline was separated from

liquid scintillation counting. data are shown as agonist-induced citrulline production calculated from the difference in radioactivity from

citrulline or cgmp measurement. data are shown as agonist-induced

tivity of the added compound was 21.5 6 3.7 nmol/mg protein
assuming that ascorbate in non-supplemented cells was
negligible (27).
effect of  xxxd228xxx  derivatives on citrulline and cgmp
formation in endothelial cells—in addition to l- xxxd228xxx ,
we investigated how the ascorbate precursor molecule l-gulonolactone, the oxidation product dehydro-l- xxxd228xxx , as
well as the derivatives ascorbate 2-phosphate and ascorbate
2-sulfate (fig. 5) influence  xxxd2379xxx -stimulated no production. all compounds were applied to huvec cultures at a
concentration of 100 mm and for a preincubation period of 24 h.
l-gulonolactone did not affect either calcium-dependent citrulline or cgmp synthesis (fig. 6). dehydro-l- xxxd228xxx  increased  xxxd2379xxx -stimulated citrulline and cgmp production
by 62 and 73%, respectively, and was less effective than lascorbic acid (fig. 6). ascorbate 2-phosphate potentiated  xxxd2379xxx -induced citrulline and cgmp formation to a similar extent as l- xxxd228xxx , whereas ascorbate 2-sulfate, another
derivative with a substituted enediol lactone ring, showed 27
(citrulline) or 20% (cgmp) of the ascorbate effect (fig. 6).

cells—to determine if  xxxd228xxx  affects the transport of the
nos substrate arginine into the cells, huvec were incubated
in culture medium containing 335 mm l-[14c]arginine (3 mci/
mmol) in the presence or absence of 100 mm ascorbate for 1–24
h. table i shows that the [14c]arginine uptake was time-dependent but was not modified by  xxxd228xxx .
effect of  xxxd228xxx  on  xxxg1579xxx  protein content in endothelial cells—to determine  xxxg1579xxx  expression, cell lysates and
subcellular fractions from untreated and ascorbate (100 mm,
24 h)-treated huvec were separated by sds-page and subjected to western blot analysis using an anti- xxxg1579xxx  antibody.
fig. 7 shows that the  xxxg1579xxx  was mainly located in the particulate fraction. differences in  xxxg1579xxx  expression were not seen
in whole lysates or in membrane or cytosolic fractions between
untreated and  xxxd228xxx -incubated cells. western blots from
control cells and ascorbate-treated cells were also labeled with
a monoclonal antibody against inos, but no staining could be
detected (not shown).
the expression of  xxxg1579xxx  protein was also measured in permeabilized huvec using a flow cytometric technique. the
comparison of cellular fluorescence signals with signals from

the amount of  xxxg1579xxx  was not changed when huvec were
incubated with 100 mm  xxxd228xxx  for 24 h as the corrected
mean fluorescence intensity was 14.5 6 2.2 in control cells and
14.6 6 2.3 in ascorbate-treated cells (n 5 10).
effect of  xxxd228xxx  on de novo synthesis of  xxxg1579xxx  protein—to investigate if  xxxd228xxx  leads to an enhanced de
novo synthesis of  xxxg1579xxx  protein in huvec, lysates from biosynthetically labeled control cells and cells treated with 100 mm
ascorbate (6 h preincubation and 3 h coincubation with
[35s]methionine medium) were immunoprecipitated with an
anti-human  xxxg1579xxx  antibody, resolved by sds-page, and subjected to autoradiography and subsequent immunostaining.
fig. 8 shows that the 35s-labeled band running at 135 kda was
specific for  xxxg1579xxx  and was not different between control and
ascorbate-pretreated cells suggesting that  xxxg1579xxx  synthesis
was not altered by  xxxd228xxx .

measurement in the presence of all cofactors except tetrahydrobiopterin revealed a 2.5-fold higher citrulline formation in
lysates from ascorbate-pretreated cells (fig. 9). furthermore,
the potentiating effect of  xxxd228xxx  was not observed in
reactions where tetrahydrobiopterin was present, but other
cofactors (fad, fmn, and calmodulin) were omitted (results
not shown). the citrulline formation in lysates from both un-

the present study demonstrates that l- xxxd228xxx  in physiologically relevant concentrations (28, 29) potentiates agonistinduced endothelial no synthesis in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. this was shown by concomitant changes of both
the formation of the no co-product citrulline and the accumulation of the no effector molecule cgmp, although the latter
might additionally indicate an increase in biological activity of
no.
the ascorbate effect on no synthesis was most likely due to
an increase of the intracellular  xxxd228xxx  concentration
since cell stimulation was performed in the absence of extracellular ascorbate. under normal culture conditions cells are
unlikely to be saturated with  xxxd228xxx  because its concentration in culture media is generally low. accordingly, an incubation of the cells with ascorbate may lead to an intracellular
accumulation of the compound. indeed, using 100 mm 14clabeled ascorbate we found an uptake of the compound into
endothelial cells which was time-dependent and saturated be-

 xxxd228xxx  potentiates no synthesis

tween 12 and 24 h. the nature of this uptake is as yet unknown, although the involvement of an active transport mechanism has been demonstrated in endothelial cells (27).
we suggest that the observed rate of  xxxd228xxx  transport
into endothelial cells demonstrated in the present study may at
least partially account for the time dependence of the ascorbate
effect on endothelial no synthesis. the latter followed a kinetics similar to the ascorbate uptake being about half-maximal
after a 6-h incubation of cells with 100 mm  xxxd228xxx  and
maximal between 18 and 24 h. moreover, a saturation of the
ascorbate uptake into endothelial cells which might occur between 100 and 200 mm (27) could explain the lack of further no
synthesis potentiation with  xxxd228xxx  concentrations above
100 mm. interestingly, 100 mm is in the range of plasma levels of
healthy individuals (28), and similar concentrations have been
found in a recent pharmacokinetic study that described the
 xxxd228xxx  concentration as a function of dose in healthy
volunteers (29).
the molecular structure of l- xxxd228xxx  consists of an
unsaturated g-lactone ring with an enediol configuration
(–coh5coh) conjugated with a carbonyl group (fig. 5). our
data suggest that this structure may be essential for the potentiating effect of ascorbate on no production. l-gulonolactone, an  xxxd228xxx  precursor molecule, is lacking the enediol
configuration and cannot be transformed into  xxxd228xxx  in
human cells due to the absence of the enzyme l-gulonolactone
oxidase. accordingly, it did not affect  xxxd2379xxx -induced citrulline or cgmp synthesis. on the other hand, dehydroascorbic
acidwhichispartiallyconvertedbacktoascorbatebyglutathionedependent reactions (30) exerted a partial stimulatory effect,
and ascorbate 2-phosphate, known to be hydrolyzed by phosphatases to restore the unsubstituted enediol ring structure
(31), was as active as ascorbate itself in potentiating no synthesis. similarly, ascorbate 2-sulfate exerted a stimulatory action which was, however, less than 30% of the ascorbate effect.
this might be due to a lack of the hydrolyzing enzyme arylsulfatase a (32) and corresponds to studies that have shown that
the  xxxd228xxx  activity of ascorbate 2-sulfate was low in
humans (33).
although  xxxd228xxx  clearly enhanced agonist-induced no

production in endothelial cells, it did not induce the expression of
 xxxg1579xxx  protein. the amount of  xxxg1579xxx  recognized with specific
monoclonal antibodies in cell lysates or in permeabilized cells was
not altered by ascorbate pretreatment. likewise,  xxxd228xxx  did
not induce de novo synthesis of nos since the 35s-labeled protein
band which could be clearly identified as  xxxg1579xxx  by immunostaining was not different in untreated and ascorbate-treated cells.
the potentiating effect of  xxxd228xxx  on no synthesis was also
not due to a supplementation of the nos substrate l-arginine
because  xxxd228xxx  did not increase the cellular uptake of this
amino acid. since the endothelial no formation is influenced by the
intracellular amount of cofactors such as nadph, fad, fmn,
tetrahydrobiopterin, and calcium/calmodulin (34), we suggested
that ascorbate might act through effects on the availability of these
compounds. indeed, when the no formation was determined in cell
lysates from control cells and ascorbate-pretreated cells under saturated conditions and in the presence of all nos cofactors, the
potentiating effect of  xxxd228xxx  was largely lost. interestingly,
this was most probably due to the addition of tetrahydrobiopterin
since a potentiating effect of an ascorbate pretreatment was seen in
cell lysates when only tetrahydrobiopterin was omitted from the
assay. moreover, the addition of tetrahydrobiopterin reversed the
ascorbate effect in the absence of the cofactors fad, fmn, or
calmodulin, and when tetrahydrobiopterin was omitted, the potentiating effect of an ascorbate pretreatment on citrulline synthesis
could be seen regardless whether fad, fmn, and calmodulin were
added to the cell lysates (data not shown). from these results we
can speculate that  xxxd228xxx  may at least partially act through
an effect on the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin or enhance the
affinity of this cofactor toward  xxxg1579xxx . an increase of intracellular
tetrahydrobiopterin levels has already been shown to stimulate the
constitutive nos activity suggesting that the  xxxg1579xxx  is incompletely saturated with this cofactor (35, 36). tetrahydrobiopterin is
thought to stabilize the active homodimeric nos (37) and probably
acts as both a redox-active cofactor of l-arginine oxidation and an
allosteric effector of the enzyme protein (38). the possibility that
 xxxd228xxx  may enhance the apparent affinity of tetrahydrobiopterin for the  xxxg1577xxx  isoform has also been suggested (39).
so far, protective vascular effects of  xxxd228xxx  have been
attributed to its radical scavenging properties which may lead
to a protection of no from inactivation by superoxide anion and
to an increase of no bioavailability. these mechanisms may
be important in vivo and may explain the improvement of
endothelium-dependent vasodilation in cardiovascular patients by an acute  xxxd228xxx  application (18 –23). the results presented in this study describe a new mechanism for
vascular protection by  xxxd228xxx  which may be effective
when plasma levels of  xxxd228xxx  supply saturated intracellular ascorbate concentrations. we suggest that tissue saturation with  xxxd228xxx  provides the optimal reaction conditions
for adequate no synthesis in endothelial cells and that a decrease in the cellular  xxxd228xxx  content may support the
development of endothelial dysfunction. future clinical studies
investigating ascorbate effects on endothelial functions should
thus include parameters that evaluate no formation in vivo.
in summary, this study demonstrates that l- xxxd228xxx 
potentiates agonist-induced no formation in cultured endothelial cells in a dose-dependent fashion. the effect was time-dependent, related to an increase of intracellular ascorbate levels,
and saturated within physiologically relevant concentrations.
 xxxd228xxx  did not induce the expression of  xxxg1579xxx  protein
and may at least partially act through an effect on the availability or affinity of tetrahydrobiopterin for  xxxg1579xxx . further
studies are in progress to clarify these suggested mechanisms.
the findings presented in this study suggest that no formation
in endothelial cells depends on tissue ascorbate levels and that
