introduction
atrial fibrillation (af) is the most common significant cardiac
arrhythmia and causes considerable morbidity and mortality. it is
estimated to affect 4.5 million people in the eu and up to 2.3
million people in the us.1 – 3 because the prevalence of af
increases with age,3 – 5 it is estimated that the number of people
with the disease will increase dramatically over the next 50
years. thus, the projected number of persons with af in the us
will exceed 10 million by 2050 (figure 1).6
af is a chronic disorder, which promotes thrombus formation
particularly in the left atrium. af increases the overall risk of
stroke five-fold,7 and is associated with particularly severe
strokes.8,9 it is also a significant risk factor for stroke recurrence.10
one of the main objectives of treating patients with af with longterm anticoagulants is to prevent thrombo-embolism and reduce
the risk of stroke. the recent acc/aha/esc guidelines recommend a risk-based approach to stroke prevention (table 1),1
so that each individual’s stroke risk is calculated to identify those
who are at higher risk, and who may benefit most from anticoagulant therapy.  xxxd234xxx  (asa), an antiplatelet agent, is recommended for patients with af who have a low to intermediate
risk of stroke,5 but only provides modest protection.11

 xxxd3522xxx  antagonists (vkas), such as warfarin, are the only oral
anticoagulants currently recommended for the prevention of
stroke in patients with a moderate to high risk of stroke, who
account for 76% of patients with af.12 vkas produce their anticoagulant effect by preventing the g-carboxylation of the vitamin
k-dependent coagulation factors prothrombin and factors vii,
ix, and x.13 vkas reduce the risk of af-related stroke by about
70%.5,14 however, they have a narrow therapeutic window: insufficient anticoagulation may result in stroke, whereas overanticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding (figure 2).1,15 vkas
have unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,
which are affected by genetic factors, drug–drug interactions,
and consumption of foods containing  xxxd3522xxx .13 due to these
factors, regular coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment of
vkas are needed to ensure that anticoagulant effects remain
within the narrow therapeutic range.
coagulation monitoring has formed the cornerstone to the
effective management of patients receiving vkas. monitoring of
the international normalized ratio (inr) levels is required to compensate for the complex pharmacokinetics of the vkas, especially
the high inter- and intrapatient variability and multiple food and
drug interactions that leads to the need for dose adjustment.13 a
predictable pharmacological profile that negates the need for

atrial fibrillation (af) is a major risk factor for stroke. currently,  xxxd234xxx  (a platelet inhibitor) and  xxxd3522xxx 
antagonists (vkas; oral anticoagulants), including warfarin, are the only approved antithrombotic therapies for stroke
prevention in patients with af. although effective, vkas have unpredictable pharmacological effects, requiring regular
coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment to maintain effects within the therapeutic range. the clinical development pathway for novel anticoagulants often involves evaluation of efficacy and safety in a short-term indication,
such as the prevention of venous thrombo-embolism (vte), followed by longer-term vte treatment studies, and
finally chronic indications, including stroke prevention studies in patients with af. the coagulation pathway provides
many targets for novel anticoagulants, including  xxxg741xxx  ( xxxg741xxx ) and factor iia (thrombin). numerous oral, direct  xxxg741xxx 
inhibitors are in various stages of clinical development, including rivaroxaban, ly517717, ym150, du-176b, apixaban,
and betrixaban, and are anticipated to overcome the limitations of vkas. dabigatran is the only oral direct thrombin
inhibitor in late-stage development. studies of these agents for stroke prevention in patients with af are planned or
ongoing. if approved, they may represent the next generation of anticoagulants, by providing new therapeutic options
for stroke prevention in patients with af.

frequent monitoring is widely regarded as essential for any new
agent. there are clinical and pharmacoeconomical advantages to
fixed dose, unmonitored agents. for example, fewer hospital or
clinic visits and a lower potential for dose-adjustment errors
suggest that there are benefits for patients16 and healthcare professionals. however, coagulation monitoring is an important
opportunity to assess patients and reassure them.16 its absence
from routine clinical care will need to be addressed; it is important
to note that low molecular weight heparins (lmwhs) are widely
accepted anticoagulants administered parenterally that do not
require coagulation monitoring.
the limitations of vkas highlight the unmet need for new anticoagulants in the prevention of stroke in patients with af. therefore, the characteristics of an ideal anticoagulant for long-term use
in a chronic condition such as af would include: oral administration, predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, a

there are many targets for novel anticoagulants in the coagulation
pathway (figure 3).17 drugs targeting the  xxxg748xxx /factor viia
complex, such as  xxxg2266xxx , prevent the
initiation of coagulation. the propagation of coagulation can be
inhibited by drugs that block factors ixa or xa, or their respective
coenzymes, factors viiia and va. these cofactors can be inactivated by  xxxg1847xxx . soluble  xxxg2277xxx  can also
affect the protein c anticoagulant pathway by converting thrombin
(factor iia) from a procoagulant enzyme into a potent activator of
protein c.  xxxg741xxx  ( xxxg741xxx ) inhibitors may block  xxxg741xxx  indirectly or
directly. fondaparinux and idraparinux inhibit  xxxg741xxx  indirectly
requiring antithrombin as a cofactor. in contrast, direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors bind to the active site of  xxxg741xxx  and block the interaction with its
substrates. there are several orally active, direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors in
clinical development for stroke prevention in patients with af,
including ly517717, ym150, du-176b, apixaban, betrixaban, and
rivaroxaban ( xxxd3134xxx ).
in the final step of the coagulation pathway, thrombin converts
fibrinogen to fibrin. oral, direct thrombin inhibitors include  xxxd3538xxx  (now withdrawn) and dabigatran. they bind directly to thrombin, blocking its interaction with substrates and thereby preventing
fibrin formation, thrombin-mediated activation of factors v, viii,

similar comorbidities to patients with af. also, there are similarities between vte and af and their recommended treatments.
for example, haemodynamic conditions and the pathophysiology
of thrombus formation are similar in the systemic venous system
and the left atrium in patients with vte and af, respectively.
thus, new anticoagulants that have the ability to prevent and
treat vte may also be effective for stroke prevention in patients
with af. furthermore, guidelines recommend the same target
inr of warfarin, the current standard of care, for both the treatment of vte and stroke prevention in af.1,5,21 therefore, new
anticoagulants that can demonstrate efficacy and safety against
dose-adjusted warfarin should theoretically be effective in both
indications.

development of novel anticoagulants
although there is a great need for new anticoagulants for the prevention of stroke in patients with af, some novel anticoagulants
have been evaluated initially in short-term indications, such as
the prevention of venous thrombo-embolism (vte) after total
hip or knee replacement surgery. this approach is ideal for anticoagulant drug development, because studies with well-defined
efficacy and safety endpoints can be carried out in a population
in which there is a relatively high rate of vte events, and bleeding
can be monitored and controlled in a hospital environment. these
types of surgery are performed under elective circumstances in
patients who are fit enough to undergo the procedure. in addition,
there is a large number of patients who undergo this procedure on
a year-by-year basis.20 studies that are successful in phase ii lead to
the initiation of phase iii vte prevention studies. drugs may then
be investigated in the longer-term setting, such as phase ii vte
treatment studies, which have a duration of 3 months or longer.
vte treatment studies can be used as dose-finding studies for
stroke prevention studies in patients with af—meaning these
drugs can go straight into phase iii development in this indication
without having specific phase ii stroke prevention studies in
patients with af. phase iii studies in this indication require longterm therapy of a year or more, and large numbers of patients
are required to evaluate the effects of new agents compared
with vkas.
phase ii vte treatment studies can be used to guide anticoagulant dose selection in phase iii stroke prevention studies in
patients with af for several reasons: vte treatment studies
provide an indication of the long-term safety profile and anticoagulant effects of the study drug in patients with chronic disease and

several oral, direct thrombin inhibitors have undergone clinical
development or are being tested for stroke prevention in patients
with af, including  xxxd3538xxx  and dabigatran.22
 xxxd3538xxx  underwent an extensive clinical trial programme. it
was evaluated for vte prevention after orthopaedic surgery and
for treatment of vte18 before its efficacy in preventing stroke
and systemic thrombo-embolism in patients with af was demonstrated in two phase iii trials.23,24 however, hepatotoxicity and
major adverse cardiovascular events were observed in several
studies,23 – 26 and thus  xxxd3538xxx  was withdrawn from all
markets and from further development in february 2006.  xxxd3538xxx  is a prodrug, and its active metabolite melagatran has been
associated with rebound thrombin generation on termination in an
in vitro study.27 this rebound phenomenon has also been observed
in patients with unstable angina, and after termination of treatment
with  xxxd218xxx  (a direct thrombin inhibitor),  xxxd1805xxx  (a
lmwh), and unfractionated heparins,28,29 respectively.
three large-scale, non-inferiority phase iii studies have now
been reported on dabigatran. all three studies compared two
doses of dabigatran (150 and 220 mg once daily) with the
approved enoxaparin regimen for that region; in all three studies
the first dose of dabigatran was given as a half dose on the day
of surgery.30 – 32 two studies showed dabigatran 150 and 220 mg
once daily to be non-inferior to enoxaparin (40 mg once daily)
for the prevention of the composite of total vte and all-cause
mortality after total knee replacement (tkr) or total hip replacement (thr).30,31 the rates of major bleeding were low and similar
between the treatment groups in both studies.30,31 however, in a
third study of over 2600 patients, which compared 12 –15 days of
dabigatran or enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily, both doses of dabigatran were shown to be inferior to enoxaparin for the prevention of
the composite of total vte and all-cause mortality after major
knee replacement surgery.32 no significant differences in the incidence of liver enzyme elevation and acute coronary events were
observed across this phase iii programme.30 – 32
results from a dose-finding study in patients with af suggested
that dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) had similar efficacy and safety
to warfarin.33 subsequently, blinded doses of dabigatran 110 and
150 mg twice daily were chosen for the ongoing phase iii study
(re-ly) for the prevention of stroke in patients with af, vs. warfarin. this study has a target enrolment of 15 000 patients and
results are expected in 2010.

 xxxg741xxx  inhibitors
in development
numerous direct and indirect  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors are currently at
various stages of clinical development, including idraparinux, biotinylated idraparinux, ly517717, ym150, du-176b, apixaban,
betrixaban, and rivaroxaban (table 2). pivotal phase iii studies of
stroke prevention in patients with af are yet to be completed
for these agents; however, phase ii studies have been reported
in some cases, which establish the efficacy and safety of these
 xxxg741xxx  inhibitors for the prevention of vte after orthopaedic
surgery and/or for the treatment of vte. these findings suggest
that these drugs may have the potential to be useful for stroke prevention in patients with af.

an attractive alternative to direct thrombin inhibition is selective
inhibition of  xxxg741xxx . indeed,  xxxg741xxx  may be a better target than thrombin because it has fewer functions outside coagulation; thus, inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  may cause fewer side-effects.19,34 numerous
studies have shown that  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors have antithrombotic efficacy at doses that are not associated with excessive bleeding.35
moreover, unlike thrombin inhibitors, direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors such
as du-176b have not been associated with rebound thrombin generation.27,35,36 finally, numerous large-scale, randomized trials have
shown that the efficacy of heparin-based anticoagulants improves
as the selectivity for  xxxg741xxx  increases.37 – 40 for example, the selective
 xxxg741xxx  inhibitor fondaparinux has superior efficacy over lmwhs,
which inhibit  xxxg741xxx  and thrombin in ratios of 4:1 to 1.5:1, respectively, depending on the lmwh, and in turn have greater efficacy
than unfractionated heparin, which has a  xxxg741xxx :iia ratio of
1:1.19,41,42 therefore,  xxxg741xxx  may be a better target than factor iia
for an effective and safe anticoagulant.

new oral anticoagulants in af

oral, direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors
ly517717
ly517717 (lilly) is an oral, direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor with an inhibitory
rate constant (ki) for  xxxg741xxx  of 4.6 –6.6 nm and an elimination half-life
of 25 h in healthy subjects; it is eliminated mainly by the faecal
route.45 ly517717 has not yet been studied for stroke prevention
in patients with af, and only vte prevention data are currently
available. in a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in
patients undergoing tkr or thr, ly517717 demonstrated dosedependent efficacy with a similar incidence of bleeding to enoxaparin for the prevention of vte (dvt/pe).45 no information
is currently available regarding future studies with ly517717
(table 3).
ym150
ym150 (astellas) is an oral, direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor, with a ki for  xxxg741xxx 
of 31 nm, which inhibits prothrombin activation induced by free
and clot-associated  xxxg741xxx  and  xxxg741xxx . in preclinical
studies, ym150 demonstrated potent antithrombotic effects in
venous and arterial thrombosis animal models with a lower bleeding time prolongation than warfarin.46 in a phase iia, randomized,
open-label, dose-escalation study for the prevention of vte in
patients undergoing thr, ym150 (3, 10, 30, or 60 mg once
daily, starting 6–10 h after surgery) demonstrated a significant
dose–response relationship for the primary efficacy endpoint
(venographically determined dvt or symptomatic dvt/pe) and
no major bleeding was reported.47 further investigation of

ym150 will continue in the ongoing onyx-2 study, a randomized,
double-blind, phase ii, dose-ranging study of ym150 for vte prevention in patients undergoing thr. it has also been reported
that ym150 is in phase ii of development for stroke prevention
in patients with af.48
du-176b
du-176b (daiichi sankyo) is an oral, direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor that
inhibits  xxxg741xxx  with a ki of 0.6 nm, and is 10 000-fold more selective
for  xxxg741xxx  than thrombin. at present, only preclinical and phase i
clinical data on du-176b have been published. in rat models,
du-176b inhibited both arterial and venous thrombosis in the
same concentration range, whereas a 100-fold higher dose of fondaparinux was required to inhibit arterial thrombosis than venous
thrombosis.49 in a phase i study in healthy male subjects (n ¼ 12),
a single 60 mg dose of du-176b inhibited  xxxg741xxx  activity, prolonged
clotting parameters (prothrombin time and activated partial
thromboplastin time), and reduced thrombus formation (venous
and arterial) in a badimon chamber for up to 5 h after administration of the dose.50 a phase iia study of du-176b administered
once or twice daily for vte prevention after thr demonstrated
proof of principle, but the results have yet to be published.
phase iib studies with du-176b in vte prevention, stroke prevention in patients with af, and prevention of thrombo-embolic
events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (acs) are
planned or have been initiated.
apixaban
apixaban (bristol-myers squibb) is an oral, direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor
that is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of free  xxxg741xxx 
(ki ¼ 0.8 nm) and  xxxg741xxx  activity.51 preclinical studies of
apixaban demonstrated its high oral bioavailability, low metabolic
clearance, and multiple pathways of elimination—including renal
and intestinal excretion.52 the randomized, double-blind, phase ii
apropos study of apixaban (total daily dose 5–20 mg) vs. enoxaparin or warfarin for vte prevention after tkr in 1217 patients
has been completed recently. combined results from the apixaban
groups demonstrated similar efficacy compared with enoxaparin
and warfarin for reducing the incidence of the primary efficacy endpoint (the composite of dvt, pe, and all-cause mortality; p , 0.02
and p , 0.01 vs. enoxaparin and warfarin, respectively). the incidence of  xxxg941xxx  (alt) elevation (alt .3
upper limit of normal) was lower in the apixaban treatment
groups than the enoxaparin group.53 however, the incidence of
major bleeding ranged from 0.0 – 3.3% for the apixaban doses,
compared with an unexpectedly low rate of 0.0% in the enoxaparin
and warfarin groups.54 following these results, a phase iii apixaban
programme for vte prevention after orthopaedic surgery has
been initiated. the three advance studies will determine the
efficacy and safety of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily compared with
enoxaparin in patients who have undergone major orthopaedic
surgery. two additional phase ii studies are ongoing, which will
evaluate apixaban for vte prevention in patients with advanced
metastatic cancer, and secondary prevention in patients with
recent acs. recruitment for the botticelli-dvt study of apixaban
for the treatment of acute symptomatic dvt has also been completed. this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase ii

dosing. in a randomized vte treatment study, idraparinux
(2.5– 10 mg once weekly) had similar efficacy (composite of vte
and all-cause mortality, and change in thrombotic burden) to warfarin and demonstrated dose-dependent increases in major bleeding.43 the lowest dose of idraparinux (2.5 mg once weekly) was
compared with standard therapy in the phase iii van gogh
study, which was conducted in patients (n¼2904) with deep vein
thrombosis (dvt) or pulmonary embolism (pe) who received
treatment for 3 or 6 months. idraparinux had similar efficacy to
standard therapy for the treatment of dvt, but failed to demonstrate non-inferiority for the treatment of pe.44
the phase ii vte treatment study of idraparinux was also used
to define the dose for the phase iii amadeus study. this was an
open-label, non-inferiority trial comparing idraparinux with
dose-adjusted warfarin for the prevention of thrombo-embolic
events in patients with af and at least one additional risk factor
for stroke. it was stopped prematurely because there was a
lower incidence of events than expected in all groups, and a very
large number of patients would be required to show a significant
difference between the therapies. there was also a trend for
more bleeding.
because idraparinux has a very long duration of action, a biotinylated version of this drug (ssr 126517) is also in clinical development. the addition of the biotin moiety would allow the rapid
removal of the drug upon the addition of avidin. a bioequipotency
study of biotinylated idraparinux vs. idraparinux for the treatment
of dvt is currently ongoing, and patients are being recruited into
the phase iii cassiopea study of biotinylated idraparinux vs.
warfarin for the treatment of pe.

new oral anticoagulants in af

study examined the efficacy and safety of apixaban (5 mg twice
daily, 10 mg twice daily and 20 mg once daily) compared with a
lmwh or fondaparinux and a vka for the treatment of subjects
with acute, symptomatic dvt. all three doses of apixaban were
considered similar to standard of care and led to the initiation of
the phase iii aristotle study of apixaban for stroke prevention
in patients with af.55 this randomized, double-blind study aims to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of apixaban 5 mg twice daily vs.
warfarin in 15 000 patients.

rivaroxaban
rivaroxaban (bayer healthcare ag and johnson & johnson/
ortho-mcneil) is an oral, direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor with a ki of
0.4 nm.58 it has a half-life of up to 12 h in elderly subjects, and
up to 9 h at steady state in healthy young subjects.59,60 the compound has no direct effect on platelet aggregation and it potently
inhibits  xxxg741xxx  activity, as well as free and clot-associated
 xxxg741xxx  activity in human plasma.61,62 preclinical studies have demonstrated the antithrombotic effects of rivaroxaban in various animal
models of thrombosis.58,63,64
rivaroxaban was well tolerated in healthy human subjects, with
a rapid onset of action and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics.59,65 rivaroxaban has no major or active
circulating metabolites. it undergoes a dual mode of elimination
with one-third of the unchanged active drug being eliminated
renally; the remaining two-thirds of the drug are metabolized by
the liver.66 a low propensity for clinically relevant drug–drug
interactions has been observed with rivaroxaban67 – 69 and it has
no effect on the qtc interval.70 phase iii studies of rivaroxaban
for the prevention of vte after major orthopaedic surgery, the
treatment of vte, and the prevention of stroke in patients with
af are ongoing. furthermore, a large, dose-finding, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase ii study (atlas acs
timi 46) is underway, which will investigate the efficacy and
safety of rivaroxaban alone, or in combination with asa, or asa
and thienopyridine in patients with recent acs.

conclusions
vkas, including warfarin, are currently the only oral anticoagulants
available for stroke prevention in patients with af. new anticoagulants with a favourable safety profile that do not require frequent coagulation monitoring or dose adjustment are needed.
drugs that inhibit fiia and  xxxg741xxx  are attractive options and numerous
oral, direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors are in clinical development; they may

betrixaban
betrixaban [prt-054021: portola; licensed from millennium pharmaceuticals (mln-1021)] is an orally available, small-molecule,
direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor that specifically and reversibly inhibits  xxxg741xxx 
with a ki of 0.1 nm. it has a bioavailability of 47%, a half-life of
19 h and is excreted almost unchanged in bile. betrixaban has
demonstrated antithrombotic activity in animal models of
thrombosis, and inhibited thrombin generation in human blood
at similar concentrations. therefore, these concentrations of
betrixaban may be sufficient to prevent venous thrombosis
in humans.56 a phase i, randomized, placebo-controlled,
single-dose-escalation study in 64 healthy subjects demonstrated
that betrixaban was well tolerated across a wide range of doses.
the completed phase ii, randomized, open-label vte prevention
trial in patients undergoing tkr provided proof of principle for
the efficacy and safety of betrixaban (15 or 40 mg twice daily) compared with enoxaparin (30 mg twice daily) in 215 patients.57 there
are also plans to develop betrixaban for vte prevention and treatment, stroke prevention in patients with af, and for secondary
prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction.

the first results of the extensive phase iiii clinical development
programme for rivaroxaban in vte prevention after major orthopaedic surgery have been reported. record3 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind trial that compared the
efficacy and safety of oral rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily with subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for the prevention of vte
in patients undergoing tkr surgery.71 rivaroxaban showed significantly better efficacy than enoxaparin for the prevention of both
asymptomatic and clinically relevant, symptomatic venous
thrombo-embolic events. rivaroxaban and enoxaparin had
similar safety profiles. three additional studies in this indication
are ongoing. these studies are underpinned by the findings of
the extensive phase ii programme that investigated rivaroxaban
for the prevention of vte after major orthopaedic surgery.72 – 75
two phase iib studies, with a treatment duration of 12 weeks,
have investigated rivaroxaban for the treatment of vte. in the
odixa-dvt dose-ranging study, patients with acute, symptomatic
dvt were treated with rivaroxaban or enoxaparin and an oral
vka.76 in the einstein-dvt study, patients with acute, symptomatic, proximal dvt were randomized to receive double-blind
rivaroxaban or open-label enoxaparin,  xxxd3379xxx  or unfractionated
heparin, and an oral vka.77 taken together, the results in over
1150 patients with dvt suggested that all rivaroxaban doses
were effective for the treatment of proximal dvt with similar efficacy to standard therapy and a low incidence of recurrent vte.
furthermore, all rivaroxaban doses (10–30 mg twice daily and
20 –40 mg once daily) had a low rate of bleeding or adverse
events, similar to standard therapy, and there was no signal for
compromised liver safety with rivaroxaban. phase iii studies with
rivaroxaban for both the initial treatment and long-term secondary
prevention of vte (with 20 mg once daily) have been initiated.
the rivaroxaban vte treatment studies also served as dosefinding for phase iii studies of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention
in patients with af, and suggested that a fixed rivaroxaban dose
of 20 mg once daily would be suitable for investigation in the
rocket-af study. this is a randomized, double-blind study that
will compare the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban 20 mg once
daily with warfarin for the prevention of stroke in approximately
14 000 patients with af. in this study, patients with moderate
renal impairment, defined as a creatinine clearance between 30
and 49 ml/min, will receive a fixed dose of rivaroxaban 15 mg
once daily. previously, two pilot phase ib studies have been conducted in japanese patients with af to determine whether there
were any ethnic differences in the safety and pharmacology of rivaroxaban; however, the results are not yet available. the results of
the large-scale phase iii study of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention
in patients with af will determine whether rivaroxaban 20 mg
once daily can be used in this indication.

162
eventually replace vkas. rivaroxaban has already shown promising
efficacy and safety in vte prevention and treatment studies, relative to standard therapy, and a large-scale phase iii study of rivaroxaban aims to determine the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for
stroke prevention in patients with af. proof of principle for vte
prevention in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery has
also been shown for other oral, direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors in clinical
development, including ly517717, ym150, and apixaban. the
results of vte prevention studies are awaited for du-176b and
betrixaban but early findings are promising. dabigatran is currently
the only direct thrombin inhibitor being tested in this indication. if
any of these novel anticoagulants are approved for stroke prevention in patients with af, we could potentially see a change in therapeutic strategies for preventing thrombo-embolic events in
patients with af.
