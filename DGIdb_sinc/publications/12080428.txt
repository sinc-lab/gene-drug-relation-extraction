 xxxd2550xxx  ( xxxd2550xxx ), the first orally available
antihypertensive agent, is now rarely used. although
celebrated in the 1950s,  xxxd2550xxx  fell out of favour
because of its widespread ganglionic side effects at
antihypertensive doses (30–90 mg/day). however,
recent studies suggest that  xxxd2550xxx  is very effective at relatively low doses (2.5–5 mg b.i.d.) for blocking
the physiological effects of nicotine and improving
abstinence rates in smoking cessation studies, particularly for women. when these lower doses of  xxxd2550xxx  are given, patients do not experience the severity
of side effects that made the drug unpopular for the

treatment of hypertension. tobacco smoking is a strong
risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity, including accelerated atherosclerosis and increased risk of heart
attacks. though currently untested, the available evidence suggests that low-dose  xxxd2550xxx  therapy
might reduce blood pressure variability and atherogenetic lipid profile in smokers. with this in mind,  xxxd2550xxx  should be an important research tool in the
field of hypertension research, particularly in recalcitrant smokers with mild to moderate hypertension.

introduction
aceytlcholinergic nicotinic receptors (nachr) have
been implicated in adverse pulmonary and cardiovascular changes associated with tobacco smoking.1–3
the adverse effects of nicotine on the cardiovascular
system are numerous.4 as nachrs are ubiquitous in
both the peripheral and central nervous system, a
broadly affecting anticholinergic that can cross the
blood–brain barrier and act specifically as an nachr
antagonist may reduce the adverse cardiovascular
changes associated with smoking and may also aid
in smoking cessation. one such drug is  xxxd2550xxx  ( xxxd2550xxx ). introduced as a therapeutic agent
for the treatment of hypertension in the 1950s,
 xxxd2550xxx  was the first useful ganglionic blocking agent that was not a quarternary ammonium
compound.5 unlike other ganglionic blocking

agents, such as  xxxd3439xxx , hexamethonium and
 xxxd2877xxx , which are not well absorbed from the
gastrointestinal track and do not cross the blood–
brain barrier,  xxxd2550xxx  is almost completely
absorbed and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier
where it acts as an nachr antagonist.6,7
there is a substantial history of wide clinical use
of  xxxd2550xxx .8 between 1954 and 1984, merck
distributed both 10-mg and 2.5-mg tablets. the 10mg tablet was discontinued in march 1984. unfortunately,  xxxd2550xxx  distribution statistics are not
available for the period of greatest drug usage as an
antihypertensive agent (1954 to 1960). however,
from 1961 until 1996, merck distributed 41 572 046
and 7 029 400 of the 2.5-mg and 10 mg tablets,
respectively. in 1996, merck sold the  xxxd2550xxx 
nda to layton bioscience. the fda has since
approved a new manufacturing site and layton
bioscience redistributed  xxxd2550xxx  on the us
market in may 2000.8
 xxxd2550xxx  is currently approved for ‘the
management of moderately severe hypertension and
uncomplicated cases of malignant hypertension’.

the antihypertensive effects of  xxxd2550xxx 
reflect its blockade of impulse transmission at sympathetic ganglia due to competition for nachrs and
stabilization of postsynaptic membranes against
excitation by ach. this sympathetic ganglionic
blockade causes blood vessels to dilate and peripheral blood flow to increase, resulting in a reduction
in blood pressure. at therapeutic antihypertensive
doses (30–90 mg/day),  xxxd2550xxx  also has parasympathetic-blocking activity, causing nuisance
side effects such as constipation, urinary retention,
dryness of the mouth and skin, dilation of the
pupils, and loss of visual accommodation in some
patients.
recently, there is considerable interest in evaluating  xxxd2550xxx  for the treatment of other clinical
indications.8 the principal focus of research on
other clinical indications largely involves  xxxd2550xxx ’s potent blockade of brain nicotinic receptors
at doses that do not have a significant effect on parasympathetic function (2.5–10 mg/day).9 potential
indications currently under investigation include
treatment of cocaine10 and ethanol abuse,11 to facilitate smoking cessation,12–15 and to treat various neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety,16 epilepsy,17,18 tourette’s disorder,19 bipolar disorder20
and major depression.21,22  xxxd2550xxx  also
appears to be well suited for the prophylactic treatment of autonomic dysreflexia.23,24
the purpose of this paper is to critically review
the research available regarding the possible use of
 xxxd2550xxx  as an aid to smoking cessation and
to propose testable hypotheses that could be studied
in recalcitrant smokers with mild to moderate
hypertension.

 xxxd2550xxx  as an aid to smoking
cessation
while  xxxd2550xxx  is still in phase iii clinical
trials and not yet indicated by the fda for smoking
cessation, there are several published studies that
conclude that  xxxd2550xxx , particularly in combination with  xxxd2721xxx , increases the rates
of smoking abstinence14,25 especially in women.15
 xxxd2550xxx  was one of the first medications
studied for smoking cessation treatment at the
national institutes of drug abuse. unfortunately,
intolerable side effects including constipation,
drowsiness, and dry month caused by the high doses
employed (mean of 26.7 mg/day) outweighed the
drug’s beneficial effects on smoking cessation.26,27
however, rose et al28 found that a very low dose of
 xxxd2550xxx  (2.5 mg/day), which was well tolerated, reduced the subjective desire to smoke.
rose et al14,25 have also demonstrated the therapeutic utility of combining  xxxd2550xxx  with
 xxxd2721xxx  for the treatment of smoking
cessation. they have demonstrated that  xxxd2550xxx , given orally (2.5 to 5 mg b.i.d.) in combination
with nicotine patches, significantly prolonged the
journal of human hypertension

duration of continuous smoking abstinence. at 1year follow-up, smoking abstinence was achieved in
37.5% of subjects. furthermore, this combination
reduced ad-lib smoking, smoking satisfaction and
smoking craving. the most common side effect in
these studies was mild constipation, which
responded well to dosage reduction and/or over the
counter laxatives.
rose et al14 also found that daily administration
of  xxxd2550xxx  alone for 4 weeks prior to the quit
date was also more effective than nicotine patches
in reducing smoking satisfaction, cigarette craving
and measures of continuous abstinence over several
weeks. in a recent study investigating gender effects
in the treatment of smoking cessation, rose et al15
found that administration of  xxxd2550xxx  prior to
quitting smoking may be necessary to extinguish the
influence of environmental cues previously
reinforced by smoking. moreover, they found that
abstinence rates were much higher for women
receiving  xxxd2550xxx  than for men. because
results from other forms of smoking cessation therapy including nicotine replacement therapy29 and
oral bupropion administration,30 indicate that
women have a more difficult time remaining abstinent from smoking than men, these new findings
suggest that pre-cessation  xxxd2550xxx  treatment
may be uniquely beneficial for women.15 ongoing
clinical studies at duke university are investigating
this unique property of  xxxd2550xxx .
although there is some evidence that bupropion
(zyban) may function to selectively block certain
nicotinic receptors in the brain,31  xxxd2550xxx 
( xxxd2550xxx ) is the only orally active well established
nicotinic receptor blocker currently available on the
us market.

new research directions for
 xxxd2550xxx : smoking and
cardiovascular disease
it is well known that cigarette smoking contributes
to human diseases including coronary and peripheral vascular disease and stroke.32 also long known
is that blood pressure and heart rate increase during
smoking. these effects are specifically associated
with nicotine, while the other components of cigarette smoking seem to be of minor importance.33
nicotine activates both parasympathetic and sympathetic ganglia by mimicking the actions of acetylcholine at nicotinic receptors. nicotine primarily
acts through the sympathetic nervous system to
raise blood pressure and increase cardiac output and
total peripheral vascular resistance. heart rate can
increase by 20–30% shortly after smoking while
blood pressure increases by about 10%.33
while most studies have found that smokers do
not have a higher prevalence of hypertension than
do non-smokers, it is clear that smokers exhibit a
persistent activation of the sympathetic nervous system throughout the day along with marked blood

 xxxd2550xxx  ( xxxd2550xxx )
rd shytle et al

pressure variability. this suggests that smoking
results in transient blood pressure elevations with
each cigarette causing blood flow to be more turbulent in smokers.33 since blood pressure variability
bears a direct positive relationship with target tissue
damage, it would be highly desired to treat habitual
smokers with an antihypertensive medication that
could reduce this variability. while at least one
study found that some calcium channel blockers
reduced blood pressure variability in smokers,
acceleration of heart rate due to smoking was not
significantly affected.34 a recent study investigating
whether an interaction exists between the reninangiotensin system and smoking found that cigarette
smoking-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system was not blunted by acute angiotensinconverting enzyme (ace)-inhibition by captopril.35
moreover, the smoking related increase in blood
pressure is exaggerated by propanolol, a non-selective beta-blocker.36 in summary, there is limited evidence that existing antihypertensive therapy is
effective in reducing blood pressure variability in
smokers. since a long-acting nicotinic receptor
antagonist such as  xxxd2550xxx  should be more
selective in minimising cardiovascular variability in
smokers, future studies could be designed to determine the safety and efficacy of low-dose  xxxd2550xxx  therapy in smokers with mild to moderate
hypertension. in a recent pharmacokinetic study by
zevin, jacob and benowitz,37  xxxd2550xxx  was
found to reduce the volume of distribution of nicotine and the cardioacceleratory and adrenalinereleasing effects of nicotine in cigarette smoking
subjects. this effect, the authors suggest, indicates
that in addition to the well-known nicotinic receptor blocking properties, part of  xxxd2550xxx ’s nicotine blocking action may be due to a decrease in
nicotine transport into the brain.
though currently untested clinically,  xxxd2550xxx  could potentially reduce adverse lipid profile
in smokers. smokers on average have been found to
have a more atherogenetic lipid profile than do nonsmokers, with increased low-densitity lipoprotein
and decreased high-density lipoprotein.38 the
adverse lipid profile in smokers appears to be
caused by nicotine because it has also been found in
humans receiving nicotine gum,39,40 and in animals
receiving nicotine alone.41–43 nicotine-induced
increases in cholesterol, triacylglycerol, phospholipid and  xxxd2154xxx  in the liver and testes of rats are
counteracted by co-administration of the nicotinic
receptor antagonist,  xxxd2550xxx .44 preclinically,
 xxxd2550xxx  has been studied for its effect on
experimental atheromatosis in normal and hypertensive male sherman rats.45 hypertension was
induced unilateral nephrectomy, renal compression
and subcutaneous implantation of desoxycortisone
acetate. all animals were maintained on regular diet
from weeks 1 to 5 inclusive and then half of the normotensive rats and half of the hypertensive rats were
switched to a high cholesterol atherogenic diet for

the remainder of the 21-week experiment.  xxxd2550xxx  at a low dose (0.2 mg/kg) was administered
orally once per day, 7 days per week from weeks 11
to 21 inclusive.  xxxd2550xxx  had no significant
blood pressure effects in the normotensive groups
on regular or atherogenic diet, but reduced the systolic blood pressure of hypertensive rats to near normal levels regardless of diet. furthermore,  xxxd2550xxx  treatment reduced serum cholesterol levels to
near normal in the rats fed the atherogenic diet, and
significantly reduced the development of aortic
atheromatous lesions (as assessed at the conclusion
of the 21 week study) in both normotensive and
hypertensive animals receiving the high cholesterol diet.
in summary, these preclinical findings support the
testable hypothesis that low-dose  xxxd2550xxx 
therapy may reduce both blood pressure variability
and adverse lipid profiles in smokers.

conclusions
 xxxd2550xxx , the first orally available ganglionic
blocker developed for severe hypertension is rarely
used anymore. however, when doses 1/3rd or less
of the antihypertensive dose are used, patients do
not experience the severity of side effects that made
the  xxxd2550xxx  unpopular for the treatment of
hypertension.  xxxd2550xxx  has been found to
potently block the physiological effects of nicotine
and to aid in the treatment of smoking cessation,
particularly in women. tobacco smoking is a strong
risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity, including
accelerated atherosclerosis and increased risk of
heart attacks. these risks are particularly strong for
recalcitrant smokers with hypertension. animal
studies suggest that various adverse consequences of
smoking are primarily due to the pharmacological
actions of nicotine through acetylcholinergic nicotinic receptor activation. a broadly affecting anticholinergic, such as  xxxd2550xxx , that can cross
the blood–brain barrier and act specifically as a nicotinic antagonist, may not only reduce the desire to
smoke, but also alleviate the adverse cardiovascular
changes associated with smoking. with this in
mind, controlled clinical trials involving low-dose
 xxxd2550xxx  therapy should be considered for
smokers with mild to moderate hypertension.
