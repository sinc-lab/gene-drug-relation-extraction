dic surgery. rivaroxaban has been investigated in phase 2
clinical trials for treatment of vte and acute coronary syndrome.17-19 it is also being studied for the prevention of stroke
in patients with atrial fibrillation, vte prevention in medically ill patients, and the prevention of recurrent vte.20-22
phase 3 trials for the use of rivaroxaban in the prevention
of vte in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery
have been completed, leading to a new drug application
submission in july 2008 and an approval recommendation by
the food and drug administration’s (fda’s) cardiovascular
and renal drugs advisory committee in march 2009.23 in
may 2009, the fda issued a complete response letter asking
for additional information to further assess the benefit-risk
profile of the drug. according to the manufacturer, the fda
did not request that any new clinical or nonclinical studies to
evaluate the safety or efficacy of rivaroxaban be performed.
the additional information requested was that from completed and ongoing studies and market surveillance from outside
the us.24 as of march 2010, the fda has yet to approve the
drug. in september 2008, rivaroxaban was approved in both
canada and the european union.14,15
previous reviews have provided a summary of all rivaroxaban development programs and only a limited critique of the
record 4 trial.25-27 this article intends to provide a thorough review and critique of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy/safety profile of rivaroxaban to
inform pharmacists and other health-care professionals of
this newly developed oral agent for the prevention of vte in
patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery.
data sources
a literature search was performed in pubmed/medline
(1966–march 2010), international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970– march 2010), and embase (1990–march
2010), limited to publications in english, using the search
terms  xxxd3134xxx , rivaroxaban,  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor, hip replacement, and/or knee replacement to identify literature sources.
references from the retrieved articles were also
evaluated to identify relevant literature. unpublished phase 3 clinical trials in progress (using
www. clinicaltrials.gov) were also reviewed. the
fda, european medicines agency (emea),
and health canada web sites were used to retrieve product monographs, regulatory guidance,
and advisory committee briefing packets.

ly administered reversible direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor, rivaroxaban,
seems to have overcome some of these disadvantages. rivaroxaban exhibits a wide therapeutic window and flat dosedependent anticoagulant response, a favorable consequence
of reversible  xxxg741xxx  inhibition, nearly eliminating the need for
coagulation monitoring.28,29 it is an oxazolidinone derivative,
structurally similar to the antibiotic linezolid (figure 1),
which has been optimized for inhibition of  xxxg741xxx .30 the similarity in chemical structures between rivaroxaban and linezolid has not been proven to demonstrate any significant clinical
similarity. it has been determined that neither rivaroxaban nor
its metabolites exhibit any type of antibacterial activity, although there remains a concern that some adverse effects
characteristic of linezolid (eg, thrombocytopenia) will be displayed by rivaroxaban.16 by binding directly to  xxxg741xxx  with its
substrate prothrombin, this antithrombin (at)-independent
inhibitor has the potential of blocking the activity of both unbound  xxxg741xxx  and clot-bound  xxxg741xxx  activity.29 the inhibition of
the active site of  xxxg741xxx  without the need of a cofactor, antithrombin, greatly differentiates this molecule’s mechanism
of action from that of other indirect  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors, such as
lmwh and pentasaccharides.31
pharmacokinetics /pharmacodynamics
rivaroxaban displays concentration-dependent inhibition
of thrombin generation in a linear fashion up to a dose of 15
mg, with no significant accumulation following repeated dosing.29 with a rapid absorption and onset of action, maximum
concentration is generally reached within 2– 4 hours after administration in healthy recipients.17 rivaroxaban has an absolute bioavailability of 80–100% after a 10-mg dose.28 the
drug is approximately 92–95% protein bound and has a volume of distribution of approximately 50 l.28 the reversible
 xxxg741xxx  inhibitor exhibits a dual mode of elimination.17 nearly
one third of the drug is eliminated unchanged in the urine,
while the remaining drug is metabolized by the liver

anisms) into inactive metabolites and excreted via the kidneys or fecal route.17,28,29 the half-life is up to 9 hours in
healthy, young subjects and 12–13 hours in the healthy, elderly population.29
rivaroxaban inhibits  xxxg741xxx  activity in a dose-dependent
manner, with maximum inhibition occurring approximately 3
hours post dosing. pharmacodynamic studies have revealed
that inhibition is maintained for 8–12 hours following a dose
of 5 mg, while doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg maintain inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  for approximately 12 hours. prolongation of median prothrombin time (pt) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) are also dose-dependent, although pt is
affected to a greater degree than aptt.32
drug interactions
published data from formal drug interaction studies are
limited to 2 small studies of concomitant rivaroxaban and
naproxen or aspirin.33,34 general information is also available in the approved canadian monograph and european
union summary of product characteristics.14,15
cyp3a4 inhibitors and/or p-glycoprotein inhibitors

due to the potential increase in area under the curve,
maximum concentration, and pharmacodynamic effects, the
concomitant use of rivaroxaban with medications that are
both strong cyp3a4 inhibitors and p-glycoprotein inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, ritonavir) should be avoided.
substances inhibiting only 1 elimination pathway of rivaroxaban are expected to have less of an effect on plasma concentrations than are those that affect more than 1 pathway.
clinical judgment should be utilized when considering
whether or not rivaroxaban can be used in combination with
other agents (ie, mild-to-moderate cyp3a4 inhibitors).16
cyp3a4 inducers

caution should be used when administering rivaroxaban
with strong cyp3a4 inducers due to the potential reduction
in rivaroxaban plasma concentrations, as seen with rifampicin.15,16
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs/platelet
aggregation inhibitors

the concomitant administration of naproxen 500 mg
with rivaroxaban does not appear to result in a clinically
relevant prolongation of bleeding time; however, there is
the potential for individuals to experience a more pronounced pharmacodynamic response.33 in the record
trials, approximately 70% of subjects received a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug. these subjects did not experience an increased risk of bleeding compared to the
overall record population.23,35-38
theannals.com

the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban do not appear to be affected by the concomitant administration of clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose followed
by 75-mg maintenance dose). however, a clinically relevant increase in bleeding time was seen in a subset of subjects receiving clopidogrel that cannot be attributed to
platelet aggregation,  xxxg2049xxx , or glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor levels.28 less than 0.5% of subjects in the record
trials received clopidogrel, and the only bleeding event in
this subpopulation occurred in a subject receiving enoxaparin.15,16,28,35-38
a phase 1, randomized crossover study demonstrated
no clinically relevant pharmacodynamic interaction for
bleeding times with the coadministration of rivaroxaban
and aspirin compared to use of aspirin alone (aspirin 500mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg on day
2).34 these data suggest that concomitant therapy may be
feasible, when indicated.
clinical studies
the clinical development of rivaroxaban for the prevention of vte in major orthopedic surgery has produced 8
published phase 2 and 3 trials.35-42 the 4 phase 2 trials
were dose-ranging studies designed to identify the dosage
with optimal efficacy/safety.39-42 generally, the phase 2 trial
results did not support a dose-response relationship between rivaroxaban and the composite primary endpoint of
any dvt, nonfatal pe, or death from any cause during the
treatment period.39-42
four phase 3 studies were subsequently performed to
further evaluate the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in
the prevention of vte following total knee replacement
(tkr) or total hip replacement (thr).35-38 the inclusion
of thromboprophylaxis trials in patients undergoing tkr
or thr is consistent with emea guidance for achieving a
claim for vte prevention in major orthopedic surgery.35-38
these studies compared rivaroxaban 10 mg daily administered 6 – 8 hours post surgery to enoxaparin 30 mg
twice daily or 40 mg once daily administered either 12
hours before or 12–24 hours post surgery, depending upon
the study design.35-38 the choice of a lmwh as a comparator appears most appropriate due to the recommendation put forth by the accp guidelines.1 alternative medications, such as fondaparinux and warfarin, are not as
commonly used in clinical practice due to burdensome
monitoring requirements, drug interactions, and/or contraindications.4,12,13,43
the efficacy outcomes evaluated across these trials were
similar.35-38 the primary outcome used in all trials was the
composite of any dvt, nonfatal pe, or death from any
cause during the treatment period.35-38 an important secondary outcome evaluated was the incidence of major
vte, defined as the composite of proximal dvt, nonfatal

pe, and vte-associated death.35-38 while the optimal outcome to assess the efficacy of new drugs for this indication
has not been established, the emea guidance supports the
choice of this primary and secondary endpoint.44 the primary safety outcome assessed was the incidence of primary bleeding from treatment initiation through 2 days after
the last dose of study medication.35-38
various diagnostic tools were utilized to evaluate the incidence of vte.35-38 to assess patients for the presence of
dvt, ascending, bilateral venography via the rabinov and
paulin technique was utilized; this was an appropriate
choice, as its sensitivity is relatively high and it facilitates
blinded study adjudication.35-38 symptomatic pe was confirmed by pulmonary angiography, spiral computed tomography (ct), perfusion-ventilation lung scintigraphy
with or without spiral ct, or chest radiography, all of
which are commonly used in the clinical setting.35-38 in the
case of death, autopsies were requested.35-38 allowing flexibility in the choice of diagnostic method accurately reflects
clinical practice and improves the generalizability of the
results.
after noninferiority was established in the per protocol
population, analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy
outcomes were performed in modified intention-to-treat
(mitt) populations to determine whether rivaroxaban’s
efficacy was superior to that of enoxaparin’s. the mitt
population uniformly included patients who had received
at least 1 dose of study medication, had undergone the
planned surgery, and had an adequate assessment for
thromboembolism throughout the record studies. the
mitt population for major vte included patients whose
proximal veins could be assessed on a venogram.35-38
the study population, which consisted of patients at
least 18 years of age scheduled for tkr or thr, was
strictly controlled to reduce the risk of confounding variables. women of childbearing age were allowed to enroll;
those who were pregnant or breast-feeding were excluded.
additional exclusion criteria included severe renal impairment, clinically significant liver dysfunction, and the concomitant use of protease inhibitors and anticoagulant therapy. overall, the groups within the trials were evenly distributed, with the exception of sex in the record 3 trial,
which included significantly more female subjects: 70.2%
versus 66.3% of subjects were female in the rivaroxaban
and enoxaparin groups, respectively (p = 0.03) (table 1).37
no information regarding the use of concomitant medications at baseline or throughout the trials was provided.
record 1 was a randomized, double-blind, activecontrolled trial conducted in 27 countries.35 a total of 3153
patients scheduled for elective thr were included in the
mitt analysis of primary efficacy. study medications were
administered through day 35 after surgery. rivaroxaban
demonstrated statistically superior efficacy for the primary
efficacy outcome and major vte compared to enoxaparin

(p < 0.001); efficacy results of phase 3 trials are presented in
table 2. compared to enoxaparin-treated patients, those receiving rivaroxaban had an absolute risk reduction (arr) of
2.6% for the primary efficacy outcome, corresponding to a

the record 2 trial was a randomized, double-blind,
active-controlled trial, intended to evaluate long-term (5
week) thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban compared to
short-term (2 week) thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin

mitt population was used to compare the primary and
secondary efficacy endpoints in a total of 1733 patients.
baseline characteristics were similar between groups with
the exception of history of vte, which was present in
0.8% of patients in the rivaroxaban group and 1.6% of
those in the enoxaparin group. the occurrence of the primary efficacy outcome was significantly lower in patients
receiving rivaroxaban compared to enoxaparin (p <
0.0001), corresponding to an arr of 7.3% and an nnt of
14. compared to those on enoxaparin, the rate of major
vte in rivaroxaban patients was also statistically significantly reduced (p < 0.0001).36

rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery

record 3 was a randomized, double-blind, activecontrolled trial conducted in patients who were to undergo
tkr.37 study medications were administered through
10–14 days post surgery. an analysis in the mitt population (n = 1702) revealed that the primary efficacy outcome
occurred in 9.6% of patients who received rivaroxaban and
18.9% of patients who received enoxaparin (p < 0.001),
corresponding to an arr of 9.3% and an nnt of 11. the
incidence of major vte was also significantly lower in patients who received rivaroxaban compared to those who received enoxaparin (p = 0.01).37
the record 4 trial was a randomized, double-blind,
active-controlled trial that enrolled patients scheduled to
undergo tkr.38 study medications were administered
through 10–14 days after surgery. in the mitt population
(n = 1924), the primary efficacy outcome occurred in 6.9%
of patients taking rivaroxaban and 10.1% of those administered enoxaparin (p = 0.0118), corresponding to an arr of
3.19% and an nnt of 31. the mitt analysis for the secondary outcome (n = 2234) did not detect a statistically
significant difference in the rate of major vte between the
2 groups.38
adverse effects
the focus of the safety analysis in the phase 2 and 3 trials was the incidence of bleeding events from treatment
initiation through 2 days after the last dose of study medication. the primary safety endpoint evaluated in these tri-

als was major bleeding, defined as bleeding that was fatal,
occurred in a critical organ, necessitated reoperation, or extrasurgical-site bleeding that was clinically overt and associated with a reduction in hemoglobin of at least 2 g/dl or
required a transfusion of at least 2 units of whole blood or
packed red blood cells.35-42 in addition to bleeding events,
cardiovascular and hepatic events were prespecified adverse events of interest.35-42
the phase 2 studies demonstrated a statistically significant dose-dependent increase in the incidence of major
bleeding events. while mild elevations in aspartate aminotransferase and  xxxg941xxx  (alt) levels
were observed in all treatment groups, there did not appear
to be a dose-dependent relationship with increasing doses
of rivaroxaban.35-38
evidenced by the phase 3 trials, rivaroxaban has a comparable safety profile to that of enoxaparin (table 3).35-38
the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse
events included nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting, all of
which were statistically similar between the study
groups.28,35-38 the occurrence of dvt, the most frequently
reported serious adverse event, was lower in the rivaroxaban group than in the comparator enoxaparin group
(0.66% and 1.77%, p value not provided).28,35-38 in the
pooled analysis of the record trials, each of the predefined bleeding endpoints (major bleeding, non-major clinically relevant bleeding, other non-major bleeding, major or
non-major clinically relevant bleeding, and any bleeding)
were increased in the rivaroxaban group compared to the

rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery

enoxaparin group. these differences were not statistically
significant, with the exception of major or non-major clinically relevant bleeding, corresponding to an arr of
0.64% and a number needed to harm of 156 (p = 0.039).28
this observation may be confounded by higher drug exposure in the rivaroxaban group, as subjects in the enoxaparin
group in record 2 received only 2 weeks of drug therapy, while subjects in the rivaroxaban arm received 5 weeks
of therapy.36 additionally, the enoxaparin subjects in
record 3 received enoxaparin 40 mg once daily, which
is likely a suboptimal dose in tkr patients.37 the incidence of major bleeding events was statistically similar between rivaroxaban and enoxaparin treatment groups in
each trial, regardless of the duration of treatment. two fatal
bleeding events occurred in phase 3 trials, the first of
which occurred in a subject who had not received active rivaroxaban.35 the second event occurred in a 53-year-old
male who was on day 6 of rivaroxaban treatment when he
experienced an upper gastrointestinal bleeding event. several concomitant medications, including goody’s powder
(acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine), naproxen, and
 xxxd2807xxx , taken for 2 weeks prior to surgery, may have
contributed to the subject’s bleeding risk.28,42
the overall rate of cardiovascular events, cardiovascular
deaths, ischemic strokes, and myocardial infarctions were
evaluated during the record studies.35-38 treatment-emergent events were those that occurred from the start of treatment through 1 day after treatment cessation. initially, in
record 1 and 2, the cardiovascular events adjudication
committee (ac/cv) adjudicated only deaths that were assessed as cardiovascular deaths by the investigator, but this
protocol was eventually amended to include all deaths.28 following the un-blinding of record 1 and 2 data, an additional 14 cases of death underwent a retrospective review;
however, this post hoc analysis was not included in the published trials.28 the rates of cardiovascular events were similar
between rivaroxaban and enoxaparin groups.28,35,36 while the
number of cardiovascular events in the rivaroxaban group increased upon follow-up in record 1, 2, and 4, the opposite
was seen in record 3.35-38 it is unclear with the limited
sample size whether there is a rebound effect due to the discontinuation of anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or this occurred by chance alone.
on-treatment elevations of alt greater than 3 times the
upper limit of normal (uln) were seen as often or more
frequently in subjects receiving enoxaparin than those receiving rivaroxaban.35-38 a concurrent elevation in total
bilirubin greater than 2 times the uln occurred in 6 subjects in the rivaroxaban group and 7 in the enoxaparin
group. statistics concerning the analysis of elevated liver
enzyme levels were not provided in the trials. it is hypothesized that many of these cases were due to complications
of surgery rather than the treatment drug itself, as perioperative anesthetic agents, anesthesia-associated hypotension,
theannals.com

blood transfusions, and the use of plasma expanders or
analgesics could result in an increase in liver enzymes.28
all treatment-emergent cases of elevated alt levels (>3
times uln) in rivaroxaban-treated subjects, with or without concurrent elevations in total bilirubin (>2 times uln),
resolved before the end of the follow-up period.35-38 no follow-up information was available for 2 enoxaparin subjects with an elevated alt (>3 times uln) who withdrew
from the trial prematurely or a subject receiving enoxaparin with alt and total bilirubin elevations (>3 times
uln and >2 times uln, respectively) who experienced
cholecystitis.36
the benefit-risk profile of this new therapy is somewhat
unclear due to variation in trial designs, especially when
considering the relative level of drug exposure when compared to enoxaparin and insufficient enrollment to detect
differences in safety endpoints. to further shed light on the
efficacy/safety of the drug, a phase 4, prospective, observational, cohort study analyzing vte prophylaxis in hip or
knee surgery with planned enrollment of 15,000 subjects is
underway.46
limitations
despite the generally favorable efficacy and safety profile of this novel anticoagulant, certain limitations exist that
affect the interpretation of the results and their applicability
to clinical practice.
the study design and duration of therapy chosen for
enoxaparin may have biased the results in favor of rivaroxaban. record 3 compared a 40-mg once-daily
dose of enoxaparin to rivaroxaban in patients undergoing
tkr.37 this dose of enoxaparin has not been proven to
prevent vte in patients undergoing tkr. in fact, a randomized controlled clinical trial, which included 438 patients undergoing a tkr, demonstrated no statistically
significant difference in the rates of vte when comparing
placebo to enoxaparin 40 mg once daily.47 the record
4 trial utilized a more appropriate dose of enoxaparin (30
mg twice daily), which has proven effective in preventing
vte following tkr.38,48 record 2 compared 2 different durations of therapy, 5 weeks of therapy with rivaroxaban to 2 weeks of therapy with enoxaparin.36 this unbalanced design of record 2 does not appear to support
any superiority claim of rivaroxaban over enoxaparin; furthermore, the rate of patients with a history of vte in the
enoxaparin group was double that of the rivaroxaban
group at baseline.
other factors, such as definitions of study outcomes and
handling of adverse event data may have influenced the
interpretation of the results. major bleeding did not include
surgical-site bleeding events unless they required reoperation
or were fatal; numerous cases of major bleeding may have
been neglected as a result of this definition. the ac/cv’s

original handling of adverse event data led to the publication
of mortality data that were not inclusive of all cardiovascular
deaths; however, a post hoc analysis was performed on these
additional deaths and was included in the publicly available
advisory committee briefing packet.28
dose and administration
the record trials utilized a 10-mg once-daily dose of
rivaroxaban for vte prophylaxis following elective thr or
tkr surgery. the initial dose was administered within 6–8
hours after surgery, after hemostasis had been established.35-38
treatment duration in the record 1 and 4 trials, arguably
the most relevant trials, was 31–39 days following thr
surgery and 10–14 days following tkr surgery, respectively.35-38 no dose adjustments are likely required for elderly patients or obese patients, given the small change in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variables in these populations.49
rivaroxaban use should be avoided in patients with severe
renal (crcl <30 ml/min) and hepatic impairment due to a
lack of trial data in these populations.35-38
therapeutic issues
current guidelines put forth by the accp recommend
several medications for the prevention of vte in patients
undergoing major orthopedic surgery, including lmwh,
fondaparinux, and warfarin.1 fondaparinux appears to be at
least as efficacious as enoxaparin in clinical trials in patients undergoing elective thr and may be more efficacious in patients undergoing elective tkr for the prevention of vte.50-52 while there are some conflicting data, it is
generally thought that lmwh and thus fondaparinux (by
indirect comparison) are more efficacious than warfarin for
the prevention of vte in this patient population.1 the
record program, notably record 1 and 4, demonstrated the superiority of rivaroxaban over enoxaparin for
the prevention of vte in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery; the comparative efficacy to fondaparinux is
unknown.35-38 some may speculate that the efficacy of rivaroxaban may be higher than that of warfarin; however,
due to the large variance in rates of vte and the sensitivity
of assessment tools used in these trials, clinicians should be
wary of making comparisons across clinical trials. another
promising therapy, the investigational oral thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, has completed phase 3 studies and
been approved in both europe and canada. these dabigatran phase 3 studies in tkr demonstrated inferior efficacy
to enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneously twice daily and similar efficacy to 40 mg subcutaneously once daily in thr
for prophylaxis of vte.53-55 one may infer that the efficacy
of rivaroxaban is superior to that of this agent; again, one
should recognize the limitations of comparisons across
clinical trials. further research is needed to form any con1068

clusions regarding rivaroxaban’s efficacy and safety compared to drugs other than enoxaparin.
with regard to safety, bleeding risk is generally the main
concern for all drugs with this indication. it is generally
thought that lmwh and fondaparinux carry a slightly higher risk of bleeding than warfarin.1 rivaroxaban appears to
have a similar risk of bleeding to enoxaparin based upon the
record trials, most notably record 1 and 4.35-38
the most tangible benefit of this new therapy is the ease
of use. while other agents are available as injections, rivaroxaban is available as an oral tablet. in addition, these
agents are often administered 1–2 times a day, while rivaroxaban is administered once daily. a potential disadvantage of both fondaparinux and rivaroxaban is the lack
of an available antidote in the event of an overdose. the
only agent recommended by the accp guidelines with
equal ease of administration is warfarin, which is plagued
by drug interactions and frequent monitoring.1
summary
despite the limitations of the phase 3 rivaroxaban trials,
the drug has demonstrated comparable safety and superior
efficacy to the widely used lmwh, enoxaparin. rivaroxaban use was significantly more efficacious for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing tkr or thr, measured
specifically by the composite incidence of dvt, nonfatal pe,
and all-cause mortality, as well as the rate of major vte.
bleeding events, cardiovascular events, and hepatotoxicity
occurred at a statistically similar rate in patients receiving rivaroxaban and those receiving enoxaparin. the differences in
trial design, variant drug exposures, and relatively small sample sizes potentially limit the validity of these results.
if rivaroxaban is approved by the fda, the currently
available clinical data support its preferential use over
enoxaparin for prevention of vte in major orthopedic
surgery. oral administration and lack of intensive monitoring requirements could increase patient adherence to the anticoagulant. studies comparing the efficacy/safety to other
available treatments, such as fondaparinux and warfarin,
could further establish rivaroxaban’s place in clinical practice. ongoing and future clinical trials will provide clinicians
with the necessary information to further assess the efficacy,
safety, and pharmacoeconomics of rivaroxaban.

rivaroxabán para el uso tromboprofiláctico en pacientes con
cirugía mayor ortopédica
sn melillo, jv scanlon, bp exter, m steinberg, y ci jarvis
ann pharmacother 2010;44:1061-71.
extracto

el propósito de este artículo es repasar la farmacología,
farmacocinética, eficacia clínica, y el perfil de seguridad de rivaroxabán
e informar los médicos sobre este nuevo agente usado para la
prevención del tromboembolismo venoso (tev) en pacientes con
cirugía mayor ortopédica.
fuentes de información: se realizó una búsqueda en los bancos de
datos de pubmed/medline (1966 a febrero 2010), abstractos
farmacéuticos internacionales (1970–febrero 2010), y emsbase
(1990 a febrero 2010). se limitó la búsqueda a publicaciones en idioma
inglés y se usó términos como “ xxxd3134xxx , rivaroxaban,  xxxg741xxx 
inhibitor, hip replacement”, y/o “knee replacement” para identificar la
literatura relevante. se evaluó las referencias de publicadas encontradas
para identificar literatura relevante. estudios de fase iii no publicadas
(usando www.clinicaltrials.gov) también fueron repasados. se utilizó
las páginas web de la administration de alimentos y drogas, european
medicines agency, y health canada para obtener monografías del
producto, guías regulatorias y paquetes de comités consejeros.
selección de estudios y extracción de datos: todos los estudios que
refirieron a la farmacología, farmacocinética, seguridad, e eficacia
clínica de rivaroxabán en la prevención de tev en pacientes que
tuvieron cirugía mayor ortopédica fueron incluidos en este repaso. se
dio preferencia a los datos clínicos publicados.
sìntesis de datos: en comparación con enoxaparina, el uso de
rivaroxabán fue significativamente más eficaz en la tromboprofilaxis de
pacientes que tuvieron una implantación de prótesis total de rodilla
(ptr) o de cadera (ptc) en términos de los resultados de la incidencia
de trombosis venosa profunda, embolia pulmonar no mortal, mortalidad
de cualquier causa, y el índice de tev mayor. la frecuencia de
hemorragia entre ambos medicamentos fue estadísticamente similar. en
los estudios de fase iii, rivaroxabán fue administrado como 10 mg por
vía oral 6–8 horas después de la cirugía y después de que se haya
restablecido la hemostasia. después de allí, se administró rivaroxabán
una vez al día por 35 días en los pacientes que tuvieron ptr y de 10–14
días en los pacientes que tuvieron ptc.
conclusiones: rivaroxabán ha demostrado tener seguridad comparable
e eficacia superior a enoxaparina, la heparina de bajo peso molecular
comúnmente usado. estudios clínicos actuales y futuros permitirán que
los clínicos evalúen la eficacia, seguridad, y fármacoeconomía de
rivaroxabán.

résumé
objectif: revoir la pharmacologie, la pharmacocinétique ainsi que les
données d’efficacité et d’innocuité du rivaroxaban utilisé dans la
prévention des évenements thromboemboliques veineux chez les
patients ayant subi une arthroplastie totale élective de la hanche ou du
genou.
sources d’information: une recherche dans les banques de données
pubmed/medline, international pharmaceutique résumé et
embase a été effectuée au mois de février 2010 en utilisant les motsclés suivants:  xxxd3134xxx , rivaroxaban, inhibiteur du facteur de
coagulation xa, arthroplastie de la hanche, arthroplastie du genou. les
bibliographies des articles identifiés ont été revues afin d’identifier des
références additionnelles. de plus, les sites web des agences
réglementaires américaine, canadienne et européenne ont été consultés

rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery

pour obtenir les informations sur le produit, les lignes directrices
pertinentes et, lorsque disponibles, les documents de consultation
préparés pour les comités aviseurs scientifiques.
sélection de l’information: toutes les informations identifiées et
publiées en langue anglaise ont été évaluées pour cet article de revue.
résumé: le rivaroxaban est plus efficace que l’énoxaparine pour
prévenir les évenements thromboemboliques veineux chez les patients
ayant subi une arthroplastie de la hanche ou du genou, les paramètres
d’évaluation significatifs étant au niveau de l’incidence combinée des
thromboses veineuses profondes, des embolies pulmonaires non
mortelles et des mortalités toute cause confondue ainsi qu’au niveau du
taux de thromboembolies veineuses majeures. le taux de saignements

était toutefois similaire d’un groupe à l’autre. dans ces études,
l’administration du rivaroxaban était débutée à raison d’une dose orale
de 10 mg entre 6–8 heures durant la période post-opératoire et se
poursuivait pour une durée de 35 jours lors d’une arthroplastie de la
hanche et de 10–14 jours lors d’une arthroplastie du genou.
conclusions: le rivaroxaban a démontré une efficacité supérieure et
une innocuité comparable à celles de l’énoxaparine. les résultats
d’études actuellement en cours permettront de confirmer ces données
d’efficacité et d’innocuité ainsi que de mieux décrire les avantages
pharmacoéconomiques associés à ce nouvel agent.
