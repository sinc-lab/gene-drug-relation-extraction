summary:  xxxd1990xxx  ( xxxd1990xxx ), a potent, dipeptide renin
inhibitor, mimics the transition state of the human renin
substrate,  xxxg99xxx .  xxxd1990xxx  has been shown to
produce dose-related suppression of plasma renin activity
(pra) and  xxxg99xxx  when administered intrave-
nously. doses of  xxxd1990xxx  of less than 0.1 mg/kg induced
little hemodynamic response in normotensive and hyper-
tensive volunteers despite marked suppression of pra.
however, at doses of 0.3 and 1.2 mg/kg,  xxxd1990xxx  pro-
duced significant, dose-related decreases in systolic and
diastolic blood pressure (bp) in hypertensive patients,
and the bp response was enhanced by pretreatment with
hydrochlorothiazide. the effects of  xxxd1990xxx  on pra and

of the several approaches to inhibition of the
renin—angiotensin system (ras), interference with
the first and rate-limiting step in the formation of
 xxxg99xxx  (ang ii) by the inhibition of renin
offers a more specific and theoretically preferable
alternative to the commercially available angioten-
sin-converting enzyme inhibitors. the early renin
inhibitors tested in humans were analogues of the
only known naturally occurring substrate of renin,
 xxxg99xxx , and were highly peptidic in nature.
renin inhibitory peptide (rip), a decapeptide, was
the first renin inhibitor administered intravenously
to normotensive human subects (1). although a
range of doses was studied, only the highest dose
(1.0 mg/kg/min) produced a blood pressure response
in the supine position. upright tilting resulted in ex-
aggerated hypotension and pronounced bradycar-
dia. although the study demonstrated that a renin
inhibitory peptide could lower blood pressure, it
also suggested that other mechanisms may have
been involved in the observed response to this par-
ticular molecule.

bp are prolonged despite its relatively short elimination
phase plasma half-life (1.6 h). persistent pharmacologic
activity without evidence of tachyphylaxis was demon-
strated during | week of treatment in hypertensive pa-
tients. the observed dissociation between suppression of
pra and bp response and the recruitment of dose-related
bp decrements, despite complete suppression of pra,
are unexplained phenomena. the results of clinical trials
with  xxxd1990xxx  are encouraging, and suggest that renin
inhibitors may be safe, useful therapeutic agents in the
management of hypertension. key words:  xxxd1990xxx —
renin—renin inhibition— antihypertensive—hyperten-
sion—renin—angiotensin system.

advances in renin inhibitor chemistry led to the
discovery of structures that utilized the transition
state of  xxxg99xxx  and resulted in compounds
with in vitro activity in the nanomolar range (2,3).
h-142 was the first in a series of transition state
inhibitors to be tested in humans (4). the com-
pound, also a decapeptide, produced clear reduc-
tions in diastolic blood pressure in salt-depleted,
normotensive subjects, only slight reductions in sys-
tolic blood pressure, and significant increases in
heart rate.

more recent analogues of the transition state of
the renin substrate, incorporating organic substit-
uents, have resulted in a new generation of renin
inhibitors that are smaller, less peptidic in nature,
and more stable than their predecessors. the di-
peptide renin inhibitors cgp38560a, r0425892, and
 xxxd1990xxx  ( xxxd1990xxx ) have been studied in normo-
tensive individuals. all three compounds produced
dose-dependent decreases in plasma renin activity
(pra) and ang ii without concomitant changes in
blood pressure or heart rate (5—7).

clinical pharmacology of  xxxd1990xxx  s77

 xxxd1990xxx  is one of the first renin inhibitors to
have been studied extensively in phase ii clinical
studies in hypertensive individuals. the compound
is a potent dipeptide inhibitor of human renin, with
an icsy of 14 nm, measured at ph 7.4 in human
plasma. in preclinical studies, single intravenous
bolus injections of  xxxd1990xxx  (0.001—10 mg/kg), ad-
ministered to anesthetized normal and salt-depleted
cynomolgus monkeys, lowered blood pressure in a
dose-related manner in both groups. blood pressure
reductions were accompanied by substantial de-
creases in pra and were not associated with sig-
nificant tachycardia (8).

this report summarizes the clinical experience
with the renin inhibitor,  xxxd1990xxx . the studies de-
scribed in the review were conducted in normoten-
sive and hypertensive individuals and included both
acute and multiple-dose administration. the data
demonstrate that  xxxd1990xxx  is well tolerated and that
dose-related efficacy can be accomplished by renin
inhibition in humans.

studies in healthy normotensive
volunteers

the first clinical experience with  xxxd1990xxx  was a
tolerance study in which  xxxd1990xxx  was adminis-
tered to eight young healthy male normotensive sub-
jects receiving a 100 meq/day sodium-restricted diet
(7). on each of two consecutive dosing days, the
recumbent subjects received a vehicle infusion fol-
lowed by three intravenous doses of  xxxd1990xxx  given
over 2 min. doses ranging between 0.001 and 0.1
mg/kg were explored in each subject.

plasma renin activity was suppressed in a dose-
related fashion over the dose range studied. peak
reductions in pra were observed within 5 min of
the infusion of doses as low as 0.001 mg/kg of en-
alkiren. pra remained suppressed below baseline
values for at least 6 h following a dose of 0.1 mg/
kg. despite inhibition of pra, blood pressure and
heart rate showed little change within the dose range
tested. ang ij measurements, specific for the 1-8
octapeptide, also showed dose-related suppression
following the administration of  xxxd1990xxx , demon-
strating that the observed decrease in plasma renin
activity led to decreased ang ii formation. the
plasma elimination half-life of  xxxd1990xxx  in these
young healthy volunteers was calculated to be 1.6
h.

these observations demonstrate the ability of en-
alkiren to inhibit renin in humans. the fact that sig-
nificant blood pressure reductions were not ob-
served in supine normotensive subjects is not
surprising and is consistent with similar observa-
tions with captopril (9). this indicates that blood
pressure regulation under these conditions is not de-
pendent predominantly on the ras.

studies in patients with mild to
moderate essential hypertension

acute studies

in an open phase ii study, the responses to single,
escalating doses of  xxxd1990xxx  were evaluated to as-
sess the efficacy and tolerance of renin inhibition in
hypertensive patients.  xxxd1990xxx  was administered
to a group of 18 patients with mild to moderate es-
sential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure
of 95-115 mm hg) who were between 32 and 67
years of age (mean of 57 years), who had no evi-
dence of clinically significant renal, hepatic, or car-
diac disease, and who could be taken off antihy-
pertensive medication for at least 3 weeks prior to
the study start. patients were maintained on an un-
restricted sodium diet and studied in the semire-
cumbent position (10). these patients participated
in a series of three nonrandomized treatment pe-
riods and one placebo period, each separated by a
minimum of 2 days. in one  xxxd1990xxx  treatment pe-
riod, an escalating series of four  xxxd1990xxx  infusions
(0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg) was given. each dose
was infused over 5 min with a 45-min interval be-
tween doses (period 1). this experimental proce-
dure was repeated with identical escalating doses of
 xxxd1990xxx  after patients were pretreated with 25 mg
of hydrochlorothiazide ( xxxd2294xxx ) twice a day for at
least 2 days to enhance the baseline activity of the
renin—angiotensin system (period 2). a placebo pe-
riod, identical to periods | and 2, except that pa-
tients received four 5-min infusions of 5% dextrose
in water to correspond to the escalating doses of
 xxxd1990xxx , was included in the study to confirm that
the observed changes were, in fact, drug-related. in
a third treatment period, a 0.625 mg intravenous
dose of enalaprilat was infused over 5 min. if the
clinical response to this dose was unremarkable, the
dose was repeated | h later. this dosing schedule
corresponds to the recommended dosing regimen
for enalaprilat.

throughout each treatment period, blood pres-
sure (systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial) and heart
rate were measured at 5-min intervals by an auto-
matic device (dinamap, critikon, tampa, fl,
u.s.a.). blood samples were drawn at specified in-
tervals to evaluate pra. measurements were by ra-
dioimmunoassay according to the method described
by sealey and laragh (11), with incubation at ph
7.4. baseline blood pressure and pra values for
each treatment period were established over 45 min
prior to  xxxd1990xxx , enalaprilat, or placebo adminis-
tration.

the diastolic and systolic blood pressure data for
period i and period 2 are presented in fig. 1. en-
alkiren produced a dose-related fall in systolic and
diastolic blood pressure in both periods 1 and 2. the
addition of concomitant diuretic ( xxxd2294xxx ) therapy in
period 2 markedly enhanced the hypotensive effect

of  xxxd1990xxx  (10). the mean fall in diastolic blood
pressure following the highest tolerated dose in-
creased from 6.4% (6.1 mm hg) in period 1 to 12.8%
(11.8 mm hg) in period 2. systolic blood pressure
fell to a similar extent from 6.3% (9.7 mm hg) in
period 1 to 13% (18.6 mm hg) in period 2. five
patients did not receive the highest dose of  xxxd1990xxx 
(1 mg/kg) in period 2 because of a striking  xxxd240xxx -
sive effect with the 0.3 mg/kg dose. despite sub-
stantial reductions in systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, no reflex tachycardia was observed at any
dose of  xxxd1990xxx .

a comparison of the hypotensive effects of en-
alkiren and enalaprilat, when administered in the
presence of  xxxd2294xxx , indicates that both agents can
produce clinically significant blood pressure reduc-
tions, with 0.03 mg/kg of  xxxd1990xxx  achieving con-
sistent falls in both systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure equivalent to a single dose of 0.625 mg of
enalaprilat (12). systolic/diastolic blood pressure re-
ductions from baseline were 6.0/4.5 mm hg (p <
0.05, repeated-measures anova) following 0.03
mg/kg of  xxxd1990xxx  and 5.1/4.4 mm hg following
0.625 mg of enalaprilat (p < 0.05 for diastolic blood
pressure only). the highest tested dose of  xxxd1990xxx 
produced blood pressure reductions from baseline
of 18.6/11.8 mm hg (p < 0.05), whereas the highest
test dose of enalaprilat reduced blood pressure by
13.9/9.9 mm hg (p < 0.05).

following completion of the clinical phase of this
study, patients were categorized into two groups
according to their baseline pra values: a high pra
group (>3.5 ng ang i/ml/h; n = 6) and a lower pra
group (<3.5 ng ang i/ml/h; n = 11). in the presence
of  xxxd2294xxx , the highest tolerated dose of  xxxd1990xxx 
produced a statistically significant (p < 0.05) fall in
diastolic blood pressure from baseline in both the
high and lower pra groups, with the high pra
group experiencing a more profound reduction of 23
mm hg in blood pressure in comparison to an 8 mm
hg reduction in the lower pra group (10,13).

a related study of eight patients with a similar
protocol also demonstrated statistically and clini-
cally significant, dose-dependent falls in blood pres-
sure with enhancement of the hypotensive effect in
the presence of a diuretic (14).

multiple-dose studies

the following study was designed to evaluate the
effects of chronic administration (1 week) of a renin
inhibitor in humans to assess tolerance and efficacy
with repeated dosing. thirty-two patients with mild
to moderate essential hypertension (sitting diastolic
blood pressure of 100-114 mm hg) were studied in
a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose
trial (15). patients were maintained on a 60 meq/
day sodium diet for the duration of this inpatient
study. intravenous infusions were given every 6 h
clinical pharmacology of  xxxd1990xxx 

(0600, 1200, 1800, and 2400 h) for seven consecutive
days. on the eighth and final day of treatment, pa-
tients received only a single dose at 0600 h so that
blood pressure could be followed for 24 h. all in-
fusions were administered over 10 min with patients
in the sitting position. patients were randomly as-
signed to receive one of the following four treatment
regimens of  xxxd1990xxx : (a) placebo q6h; (b) 0.1 mg/
kg q6h; (c) 0.3 mg/kg q6h; and (d) 1.2 mg/kg q.d.
the 1.2 mg/kg dose was given once a day at 0600 h
with placebo infusions to correspond to the dosing
times of the other treatment regimens. the blood
pressure response was evaluated by 24-h ambula-
tory blood pressure recordings (spacelabs, inc.
redmond, wa, u.s.a.) obtained on the baseline
day, first day of treatment, midweek, seventh day
of treatment, and following the final infusion at 0600
hon day 8. blood samples were drawn at designated
intervals during the study for measurement of pra.

the baseline mean pras among the treatment
groups did not differ statistically (mean pra ranged
from 1.58 to 2.68 ng ang i/ml/h). pra was promptly
suppressed following the first administration of en-
alkiren and remained suppressed throughout the
study in all groups (15).

systolic and diastolic blood pressure data aver-
aged over 6 h intervals are shown in figs. 2 and 3,
respectively, for all four groups. despite sustained
suppression of pra in the low dosing group (0.1 mg/
kg q.i.d.), little change in blood pressure was ob-
served compared to placebo. the 0.3 mg/kg q.i.d.
and 1.2 mg/kg q.d. regimens both produced statis-
tically significant reductions in systolic and diastolic
blood pressure compared to the changes seen in the
placebo group. statistically significant blood pres-
sure responses were apparent on the first dosing
day. furthermore, the blood pressure lowering ef-
fect of  xxxd1990xxx  in both groups was enhanced be-
tween days | and 7.

on day 8, when only one infusion was adminis-
tered, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure low-
ering effect of  xxxd1990xxx  persisted for at least 12 h
following doses of 0.3 and 1.2 mg/kg. average dia-
stolic blood pressure, measured from 6 to 12 h post-
dosing on day 8, decreased 10.2% from a baseline
value of 97.5 mm hg for the 0.3 mg/kg group and
16.4% from a baseline value of 92 mm hg for the
1.2 mg/kg group. while systolic blood pressure re-
sponses were quantitatively larger than diastolic re-
sponses, the percentage reductions in systolic and

diastolic blood pressure were similar. interestingly,
on day 8, statistically significant reductions in sys-
tolic blood pressure were sustained for 24 h after a
single 1.2 mg/kg dose of  xxxd1990xxx .

blood pressure changes were not associated with
reflex tachycardia and the drug was well tolerated.
the prolonged reduction of blood pressure with re-
peated administration of  xxxd1990xxx , without evi-
dence of tachyphylaxis, suggests that renin inhibi-
tion may be a useful new approach to the treatment
of hypertension.
