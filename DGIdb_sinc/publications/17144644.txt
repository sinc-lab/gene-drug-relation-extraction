[pregabalin (lyrica) and neuropathic pain syndromes].  pregabalin is a novel central nervous system (cns) drug with no interaction at benzodiazepine or gaba receptor. its mechanism of action is correlated with its high affinity for the alpha/delta submit of the voltage-dependant cns calcium channel. pregabalin is rapidly absorbed with at least 90% bioavailable irrespective of dose, does not bind to plasma proteins and is excreted virtually unchanged by the kidneys. pharmacokinetics are linear and predictable across the therapeutic dose range (150-600 mg/ day). pregabalin is indicated, like gabapentin, in the treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes like post-herpetic neuralgia (phn) and diabetic polyneuropathy (dpn). efficacy in other neuropathic pain syndromes need further investigations. this paper emphasizes advantages and disadvantages on a clinical point of view.
