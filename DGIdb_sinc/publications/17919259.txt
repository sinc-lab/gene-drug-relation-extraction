abstract
several fluid retentive states such as heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and syndrome
of inappropriate  xxxd3495xxx  secretion are associated with inappropriate elevation
in plasma levels of  xxxd3495xxx  (avp), a neuropeptide that is secreted by the
hypothalamus and plays a critical role in the regulation of serum osmolality and in circulatory
homeostasis. the actions of avp are mediated by three receptor subtypes v 1a , v 2 , and v 1b .
the v 1a receptor regulates vasodilation and cellular hypertrophy while the v 2 receptor
regulates free water excretion. the v 1b receptor regulates  xxxg1801xxx  hormone
release.  xxxd1747xxx  is a nonpeptide dual v 1a /v 2 avp receptor antagonist. it binds with high
affinity, competitively, and reversibly to the v 1a /v 2 receptor subtypes; its antagonistic effect
is concentration dependent. it inhibits cyp3a4 liver enzyme and elevates plasma levels
of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. it is approved only for short-term intravenous
use. infusion site reaction is the most common reason for discontinuation of the drug.
in animals  xxxd1747xxx  increased urine volume and free water clearance. in heart failure
models it improved hemodynamic parameters and free water excretion.  xxxd1747xxx  has
been shown to correct hyponatremia in euvolemic or hypervolemic patients. its efficacy

and safety for short-term use have led to the food and drug administration (fda) approval
of its intravenous form for the correction of hyponatremia in euvolemic and hypervolemic
states. despite its ability to block the action of avp on v 1a receptors, no demonstrable
benefit from this action was noted in patients with chronic compensated heart failure and
it is not approved for this indication. consideration should be given to further evaluation of
its potential benefits in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

introduction
many clinical conditions have been associated with complex neuroendocrine interactions. in heart failure, activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone and adrenergic systems are part of a neurohormonal contribution to a vicious cycle resulting in, among other
things, an imbalanced volume homeostasis. drugs such as  xxxg36xxx 
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and beta-blockers are
proven effective therapies against this neurohormonal propagation of heart failure. receptor antagonism of another neurohormone,  xxxd3495xxx  (avp), may potentially be
beneficial in conditions of disrupted volume homeostasis. elevated serum level of avp
has been implicated in clinical conditions associated with abnormal water retention, such
as heart failure, cirrhosis, the syndrome of inappropriate  xxxd3495xxx  secretion
(siadh), and may potentially contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of these clinical conditions. the cardiovascular and renal effects of avp are mediated by two main
receptor subtypes (v 1a and v 2 ), and the ability to selectively block these receptors has led
to current development of at least half a dozen avp receptor antagonists. one of them,  xxxd1747xxx , a novel nonpeptide, dual v 1a /v 2 avp receptor antagonist is currently the only avp
receptor antagonist that is approved in the usa by the u.s. food and drug administration
(fda) in its intravenous form for the treatment of euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.
in addition to its proven efficacy in correcting hyponatremia by blocking the v 2 receptors
and inducing aquaresis, it has a theoretical advantage of blocking the v 1a receptors leading
to vasodilation and unloading of the heart. these properties make  xxxd1747xxx  an attractive
option for the treatment of congestive heart failure.

 xxxd3495xxx 
it has been suggested that two systems exist that define the action of avp. a central
system where avp acts as a neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of various central
nervous system-mediated functions such as learning and memory, social behaviors, and
autonomic function as well as a peripheral system that mediates the classical function
ascribed to avp (antidiuresis and vasoconstriction) (ring 2005). the latter system is the
focus of this review.
avp is a neuropeptide hormone discovered half a century ago produced in the supraoptic
nuclei and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary
(guyton 2006). this neurohormone is important in the maintenance of volume homeostasis
by osmotic and nonosmotic mechanisms (schrier and abraham 1999). osmoreceptors in the
hypothalamus detect very small changes in plasma osmolality and stimulate or inhibit avp

secretion resulting in tight control of serum sodium levels and plasma osmolality (guyton
2006). with a decrease of either cardiac output or peripheral vascular resistance causing
effective arterial underfilling, mechanoreceptors located in the carotid sinus, aortic arch, and
left ventricle stimulate sympathetic central nervous system outflow causing increased avp
production (kamoi et al. 1997; schrier and abraham 1999). a third mechanism affecting
avp levels involves a complex neurohormonal interaction with the renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone axis (brooks et al. 1986; mitchell et al. 1982). the nonosmotic mechanisms
seem to have a far greater influence than the osmoreceptors on controlling avp release in
low cardiac output states such as heart failure leading to paradoxical water retention in an
already edematous state (schrier and abraham 1999; uretsky et al. 1985).
among the neurohormones involved in heart failure, avp is one of the most important
contributors to a vicious cycle resulting in imbalanced volume homeostasis (schrier and
abraham 1999). in heart failure and other abnormal water retentive conditions including
cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and siadh, avp levels are found to be chronically elevated (abraham and schrier 1994; guyton 2006; szatalowicz et al. 1981). elevated avp
serum levels may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of these clinical conditions as higher circulating levels of the hormone are found in more advanced disease and
in hyponatremia (francis et al. 1990; goldsmith et al. 1983; rouleau et al. 1994).
in addition to fluid imbalance and hyponatremia caused by the effects of elevated circulating avp levels, unfavorable hemodynamic changes such as increased pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance tend to increase afterload and compromise
further the heart failure state (goldsmith et al. 1986; wallace et al. 1989).
hyponatremia is a very common problem in hospitalized patients (upadhyay et al. 2006)
and is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with heart failure (gheorghiade
et al. 2007; lee and packer 1986). impaired renal water excretion in the absence of renal
failure has been characterized by inappropriately elevated plasma levels of avp (adrogue
and madias 2000). the most common clinical conditions for hypervolemic hyponatremia
are heart failure and cirrhosis, while siadh is the most common cause of euvolemic
hyponatremia (bartter and schwartz 1967; bichet et al. 1982; goldsmith et al. 1983).
although hyponatremia is commonly defined as serum [na+ ] < 136 meq/l, recent data
from 47,647 patients hospitalized with heart failure clearly indicate a significant increase
in the risk of in-hospital mortality rate at serum sodium ≤ 138 meq/l, suggesting that the
definition of hyponatremia should be revised (ghali 2007).

vasopressin receptors
there are three avp receptor subtypes, v 1a , v 1b , and v 2 (ali et al. 2007; greenberg
and verbalis 2006). the v 1a receptor subtype is located in vascular smooth muscle cells,
cardiomyocytes, platelets, and hepatocytes (jard et al. 1988; park et al. 1997; verbalis
et al. 2002). as described above, one of the hemodynamic effects of avp mediated by this
receptor is vasoconstriction of smooth muscles producing an increase in systemic vascular
resistance and thus afterload (wallace et al. 1989). in vivo, reduced sympathetic nervous
system outflow as a result of central activation of the baroreflex system seems to mitigate
this vasoconstriction (ebert and cowley 1992; ebert et al. 1986). v 1a receptor-mediated
vasoconstriction of the coronary arteries has also been described and could potentially
reduce the blood supply to the heart (khayyal et al. 1985). a positive inotropic effect

on cardiomyocytes results when avp stimulates v 1a receptors. however, at high serum
levels of avp negative inotropy is observed, most likely secondary to the decreased global
perfusion due to coronary vasoconstriction (graf et al. 1997; walker et al. 1988). other
possible effects on cardiomyocytes include hypertrophy, which is believed to be a result of
increased intracellular myocyte calcium levels with increased protein synthesis (fukuzawa
et al. 1999; nakamura et al. 2000; reilly et al. 1998; tahara et al. 1998). the effect of the
receptor on platelets and hepatocytes appears to mediate platelet aggregation and glycogen
metabolism, respectively (howl et al. 1991; strasser et al. 2000). v 1a receptors are present
in low abundance on human hepatocytes and their effect on glycogen metabolism appears
to be very limited (howl et al. 1991).
the v 2 receptor subtype is predominantly found in the collecting tubules of the kidney
and mainly mediates the antidiuretic effect of avp (nielsen et al. 1999). this is accomplished by mobilization of intracellular vesicles of aquaporin-2 to the apical plasma membrane of the collecting duct cells producing an increased permeability to water and thus an
antidiuretic action (nielsen et al. 1999). generation of prostaglandin  xxxd2037xxx  in the medullary
interstitial cells has been found to oppose the v 2 -mediated renal effects, which explains the
antidiuretic effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (sonnenburg and smith 1988).
an extrarenal effect mediated by v 2 receptors located in the vascular endothelium has been
described implicating the secretion of the  xxxg2423xxx  (bernat et al. 1997).
a third known receptor, the v 1b receptor subtype found in the anterior pituitary, is
believed to mediate acth release (tanoue et al. 2004). this receptor subtype is also found
in langerhans cells of the pancreas and in the kidneys (folny et al. 2003; lolait et al. 1995).
there are no known direct cardiovascular effects mediated by this receptor subtype, which
has been implicated in mediating glucagon secretion and promotion of cellular proliferation
(folny et al. 2003).
the action of avp at its receptor subtypes involves binding to a 7-transmembrane domain
g-protein-coupled receptor leading to activation of either phosphoinositol or  xxxg67xxx 
depending on the receptor subtype. activation of both the v 1a and v 1b receptors is mediated
by phosphoinositol and the v 2 receptor by  xxxg67xxx . the activation of these signaling
modalities initiates a cascade of events involving calcium mobilization, coupling of the g q
protein and activation of multiple kinases (tahara et al. 1998; verbalis et al. 2002). the three
receptor subtypes are differentiated by different binding mechanisms that have facilitated
the development of selective antagonism.

 xxxd3495xxx  antagonists
the renal and hemodynamic effects associated with elevated avp in disease states
described above are inadequately controlled or mitigated by current therapy. conventional
therapy for treating volume retention and hyponatremia including loop diuretics and fluid
restriction has limited effects. diuretics may produce kaliuresis, natriuresis, and loss of
extracellular sodium (morrison 1997), and they have been associated with an adverse effect
on renal function (gottlieb et al. 2002) and outcome (cooper et al. 1999; domanski et al.
2003, 2006).
interest in developing drugs, which selectively block avp receptor subtypes, began in the
early 1960s with the development of peptide avp antagonists. unfortunately, although these
agents antagonized pressor and antidiuretic responses in animals, they were found to have a

paradoxical weak agonism in humans (verbalis et al. 2002). in addition, these compounds
had short biological half-lives and poor oral bioavailability (nicod et al. 1985; verbalis
et al 2002). in 1991, the first nonpeptide avp receptor antagonist was discovered in japan
(yamamura et al. 1991). since then half a dozen nonpeptide avp receptor antagonists have
been developed and are under clinical investigation. these newer compounds have better
bioavailability and longer biological half-lives than the earlier peptide compounds. of these
new antagonists, only  xxxd1747xxx  has been approved by the fda to date for the management
of euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. a summary of the actions of  xxxd1747xxx  can
be found in figure 1.

chemistry
(ym087)  xxxd1747xxx  or  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride was discovered at yamanouchi
pharmaceutical co. ltd. in japan and further developed at astellas pharma u.s.
inc. in the united states.  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride is a white to pale orangewhite powder that is slightly soluble in water (0.15 mg/ml at 23◦ c). the chemical
name for this benzazepine derivative is [1,1-biphenyl]-2-carboxamide,n-[4-[(4,5-dihydro2-methylimidazo[4,5-d][1]benzazepin-6(1h)-yl)carbonyl] phenyl] mono-hydrochloride,
which is a nonpeptide and functions as a dual v 1a and v 2 receptor antagonist
(fig. 2). yamanouchi’s chemists synthesized a series of azolbenzazepine derivatives in
an attempt to develop a nonpeptide dual v 1a and v 2 receptor antagonist. the initial series of compounds included 4 -(1,4,5,6-tetrahydroimidazo[4,5-d][1]benzoazepine6-carbonyl)benzanilide, which was a potent v 1a and v 2 receptor antagonist (matsuhisa
et al. 2000; nicod et al. 1985). one of the derivatives of this compound was ym087, or
 xxxd1747xxx . the synthetic route yielded a 5% overall yield initially but was later improved

to a 13% yield by a newly developed and more cost-effective synthetic route (tsunoda et al.
2004).

preclinical studies
 xxxd1747xxx  has potent affinity for both v 1a and v 2 receptor subtypes with a k i value
of 0.48 nm and 3.04 nm in vitro, respectively (burnier et al. 1999; tahara et al. 1997). at
concentrations up to 100 µm it has essentially no effect at the v 1b receptors.  xxxd1747xxx 
binds competitively and reversibly to the v 1a /v 2 receptor subtypes with an antagonistic
effect, that is concentration dependent (burnier et al. 1999; tahara et al. 1997). antagonism
of the v 1a receptor causes an improved hemodynamic profile by reducing systemic vascular
resistance, afterload (nicod et al 1995; yatsu et al. 1999, 2002), and also by decreasing direct
myocyte stimulation and hypertrophy. in an in vitro study, v 1a antagonism decreased the
effects of avp-induced contraction of rat vascular smooth muscle (tahara et al. 1997).
other in vitro rat studies demonstrated inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy and favorable
effects on remodeling, making v 1a blockade a promising target in heart failure (fukuzawa
et al. 1999; nakamura et al. 2000; tahara et al. 1998). however, confirmation from in vivo
studies is lacking to date. antagonism of the v 2 receptor increases free water excretion
causing hypoosmolar urine, enhanced diuresis, and increased plasma sodium levels (yatsu
et al. 1999).

pharmacokinetics
drug formulation and dosing
the pharmokinetics have been studied in healthy and special populations using both
oral and intravenous formulations.  xxxd1747xxx  injection is supplied as a sterile liquid in
an ampule. each ampule delivers 20 mg  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride, 1.2 g  xxxd3034xxx ,
0.4 g ethanol, and water for injection (tahara et al. 1997). lactic acid is added for ph
adjustment to 3.0 (tahara et al. 1997). a loading dose of 20 mg is administered through a
large vein given over 30 min followed by a maintenance dose of 20–40 mg per day for up
to 4 days by continuous infusion. the infusion site is changed every 24 h to avoid infusion
site complications like phlebitis. close monitoring of serum sodium and volume status
is recommended and the dose can be adjusted. oral  xxxd1747xxx  is usually administered at

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 25, no. 3, 2007

 xxxd1747xxx 

267

double the intravenous dose two times daily for a continued effect. in the majority of clinical
trials  xxxd1747xxx  has been administered orally at doses ranging from 20 to 80 mg. however,
oral formulation is currently not yet available.

bioavailability
in an animal study, oral  xxxd1747xxx  inhibited avp binding in v 1a and v 2 receptors in
the liver and kidney, respectively. its effect was dose-dependent and persisted for over 24 h
demonstrating potential long action (risvanis et al. 1999). the bioavailability of  xxxd1747xxx ,
60 mg p.o., was studied in six healthy individuals; its plasma levels reached a mean c max
of 664 ng/dl, its t 1/2 was 0.34 h with the absolute bioavailability of 44%. intravenous
 xxxd1747xxx , 50 mg, had a t 1/2 of 3.1 h (burnier et al. 1999). in 104 patients with class
iii/iv heart failure, a single intravenous dose of  xxxd1747xxx , 10, 20, or 40 mg, yielded a
maximum rate of elimination v max 5.08 ± 1.89 mg/h, an intrinsic metabolic clearance
rate of 17.6 ± 6.5 l/h, and a terminal t 1/2 of 7.8 h (range 5–12) (udelson et al. 2001).
the maximum plasma concentration c max was 100 to 1100 ng/ml with 10 and 40 mg
doses, respectively, and auc value 600 and 4000 ng/ml, respectively (udelson et al.
2001). the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1747xxx  following intravenous infusion (40 to 80 mg/d)
or oral administration was nonlinear probably due to inhibition by  xxxd1747xxx  of its own
metabolism ( xxxd1747xxx  insert, 2006). intersubject variability of  xxxd1747xxx  pharmacokinetics
was found to be high. pharmacokinetics of intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  and its metabolites was
studied in healthy male subjects;  xxxd1747xxx  administered i.v. as a 20-mg loading dose over
30 min followed by a continuous infusion of 40 mg/d for 3 days. at the end of the loading
dose, the mean c max for  xxxd1747xxx  was 619 ng/ml. twelve hours after the start of the
loading dose, plasma concentrations reached a minimum and then gradually increased over
the duration of the infusion to a mean concentration of 188 ng/ml by the end of the infusion.
the mean terminal elimination half-life after  xxxd1747xxx  infusion was 5.0 h with a mean
clearance of 15.2 l/h ( xxxd1747xxx  insert, 2006). the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1747xxx  was
studied in an open-label safety and efficay trial in patients with hypervolemic or euvolemic
hyponatremia. the patients ranged in age between 51 and 89 years; they received  xxxd1747xxx 
hydrochloride as a 20-mg loading dose (infused over 30 min) followed by a continuous
infusion of 20 or 40 mg/d for 4 days ( xxxd1747xxx  insert, 2006). the mean  xxxd1747xxx  plasma
levels in hypervolemic patients were 575.8 µg/dl, t 1/2 6.7 h, and a renal clearance of
10.1 l/h, while in the euvolemic group the plasma concentration was 781.1 µg/dl, t 1/2
8.6 h, and renal clearance of 9.5 l/h ( xxxd1747xxx  insert, 2006).

metabolism
 xxxd1747xxx  binds extensively to human plasma proteins; at plama levels of 10 to
1000 ng/ml 99% of the drug is bound. liver cytochrome p450 isozyme cyp3a4 is
responsible for the metabolism of  xxxd1747xxx  to four metabolites (burnier et al. 1999).
pharmacological activity of these metabolites at v 1a receptors ranges from 3 to 50% and
at v 2 receptors from 50 to 100% that of  xxxd1747xxx  ( xxxd1747xxx  insert, 2006). the combined
exposure of the metabolites after intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  was approximately 7% that of
 xxxd1747xxx , making only a small contribution to the clinical effects. after 10 mg i.v. or

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 25, no. 3, 2007

268

f. ali et al.

20 mg p.o., over 80% of the dose was excreted in feces and the rest in urine. twenty-four
hours after dosing, approximately 1% of the intravenous dose was excreted as intact  xxxd1747xxx  in urine ( xxxd1747xxx  insert, 2006). studies in special populations, including patients
with renal and hepatic insufficiency, demonstrated higher levels of  xxxd1747xxx  after oral
intake. since intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  results in higher exposure to the drug, caution should
be used in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

drug interactions
 xxxd1747xxx  is a sensitive substrate as well as a potent inhibitor of liver enzyme cyp3a4,
a cytochrome p450 isoenzyme. the coadministration with other drugs that inhibit the p450
system could result in an increase in  xxxd1747xxx  levels, thus increasing the chance for side
effects. similarly,  xxxd1747xxx  as a potent inhibitor of the p450 system can increase other
drug levels and potentially their side effects (table 1). the effect of ketoconazole, a potent
cyp3a4 inhibitor, on the serum levels of intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  has not been evaluated;
however, coadministration of oral  xxxd1747xxx  10 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg resulted in a
4- and 11-fold increase in c max and auc of  xxxd1747xxx , respectively ( xxxd1747xxx  insert, 2006).
when coadministered,  xxxd1747xxx  increases the drug effect of midazolam, simvastatin, and
amlodipine. intravenous  xxxd1747xxx , 40 mg/d, increased the mean auc values for 1 mg
i.v. or 2 mg p.o. doses of midazolam by approximately 2- and 3-fold, respectively. at
30 mg/d i.v.  xxxd1747xxx  resulted in a 3-fold increase in the auc of simvastatin and has
been associated with an increased incidence of rhabdomyolysis. forty milligrams p.o. of
twice daily  xxxd1747xxx  resulted in a 2-fold increase in the auc and half-life of amlodipine
( xxxd1747xxx  insert, 2006). coadministration of oral  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg twice daily with a
0.5-mg dose of digoxin resulted in a 30% reduction in systemic clearance and 43 and 79%
increases in digoxin auc and c max values, respectively. warfarin, captopril, and furosemide
when coadministered with oral  xxxd1747xxx , had no effect on drug levels of  xxxd1747xxx . the
interaction of i.v.  xxxd1747xxx  with warfarin has not been studied ( xxxd1747xxx  insert, 2006).

pharmacology
in vitro
some of the first in vitro studies with  xxxd1747xxx  demonstrated its high affinity for rat
kidney v 2 and rat liver v 1a receptors with a k i value of 3 and 0.5 nm, respectively (tahara
et al. 1997). v 1a antagonist activity by  xxxd1747xxx  was confirmed by attenuated avpinduced increases in ca2+ in vascular smooth muscle cells (ic 50 = 1.16 nm). v 2 antagonist
activity of  xxxd1747xxx  was confirmed by avp-mediated increase in camp (ic 50 = 17.3nm)
(tahara et al. 1997). in another in vitro binding study ic 50 values for  xxxd1747xxx  in the
displacement of specific avp binding were 0.9 ± 0.1 nm and 2.2 ± 0.1 nm, respectively,
for the effects on rat kidney v 2 and liver v 1a receptors (risvanis et al. 1999). beside rat
models, other in vitro models included canine platelet v 1a and kidney v 2 preparations; the
k i values of  xxxd1747xxx  were 0.6 and 0.7 nm, respectively. at the monkey liver v 1a and
kidney v 2 receptors the k i values of  xxxd1747xxx  were 26 and 10 nm, respectively (matsuhisa
et al. 2000; tahara et al. 1998).

in a human in vitro preparation of cloned v 1a and v 2 receptors expressed in cos1
cells, the respective k i values for  xxxd1747xxx -induced inhibition of avp were 6.3 and 1.1
nm.  xxxd1747xxx  was also found to inhibit concentration-dependent avp-induced increase
in intracellular ca2+ or in camp with ic 50 values of 14.3 and 2.0 nm, respectively (tahara
et al. 1998). avp-induced intracellular ca2+ , mitogen-activated kinase, and protein synthesis were inhibited by  xxxd1747xxx  in cultured rat cardiomyocyte cells with v 1a receptors
(tahara et al. 1998). the same effect was observed in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle
cells with an isolated population of v 1a receptors (ishikawa and saito 1998; tahara et al.
1997). avp-induced hyperplasia and hypertrophy of growth-arrested vascular smooth muscle cells were inhibited by  xxxd1747xxx . (ishikawa and saito 1998; tahara et al. 1997). these
in vitro studies suggested a potential role for  xxxd1747xxx  in the avp-induced cardiac and
vascular hypertrophy.

aquaretic effects
animal in vivo studies have demonstrated improvements in hemodynamic parameters and
free water excretion after  xxxd1747xxx  administration.  xxxd1747xxx  was studied in rats by i.v.
as well as by p.o. admninistration. in pithed rats, the pressor effects of avp were inhibited by
i.v.  xxxd1747xxx  with an id 50 value of 0.013 mg/kg (tahara et al. 1997). in rats with elevated
endogenous avp after water restriction for 16 to 20 h,  xxxd1747xxx  i.v. increased urinary
volume (tahara et al. 1997). in water-deprived rats  xxxd1747xxx  in food increased urine
volume and decreased urinary osmolality without any effect on the basal blood pressure,
although it inhibited pressor responses to avp (tomura at al. 1999). sustained aquaresis
for 8 to 10 h was seen in rats with access to water after oral  xxxd1747xxx  (tomura et al. 1999).
dose-dependent aquaresis was seen in normotensive rats after oral  xxxd1747xxx  without any
effect on the systolic blood pressure (risvanis et al. 1999).
in normal dogs, intravenous or oral  xxxd1747xxx  showed dose-dependent increase in urine
flow with little effect on natriuresis or kaliuresis (yatsu et al. 1997). these effects were
in contrast to those of furosemide, which produced marked natriuresis, kaliuresis, and
chloruresis (matsukawa et al. 2002; yatsu et al. 1999).

effects in heart failure models
several in vivo studies demonstrated potentially beneficial effects of  xxxd1747xxx  in heart
failure. in a study with pacing-induced heart failure in dogs, i.v.  xxxd1747xxx  increased urine
volume, reduced urine osmolality, and, more importantly, decreased left ventricular enddiastolic pressure and systemic vascular resistance. it also increased cardiac output as well
as maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure over time (dp/dt) (yatsu et al. 1999).
it has been suggested that that the favorable hemodynamic effects of  xxxd1747xxx  were due
to antagonism at the v 1a receptors and the aquaretic effects due to the antagonism at the
v 2 receptors. in another study in dogs infused with avp, i.v.  xxxd1747xxx  attenuated avpinduced decrease in cardiac output and reversed the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure as well as in peripheral vascular resistance (yatsu et al. 2002).
in rats with heart failure, induced by coronary artery ligation,  xxxd1747xxx , p.o. increased
urine volume and decreased urine osmolality with a favorable effect in attenuating the

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 25, no. 3, 2007

increase in left ventricular diastolic pressure and right ventricular weight (wada et al.
2002).
in vivo heart failure models permitted the assessment of possible effects of  xxxd1747xxx 
in combination with other heart failure therapies, such as  xxxg36xxx 
inhibitors, and served as an important step in assessing the practicality of possible future
clinical studies in heart failure. in a coronary ligation-induced model of heart failure, rats
received captopril,  xxxd1747xxx , or their combination, and their effects were compared to
those of a placebo over a four-week period. although  xxxd1747xxx  was associated with
increased water excretion, the combination therapy was the only treatment that reduced
blood pressure, natriuretic peptide levels, and pulmonary congestion (naitoh et al. 2002).

clinical studies
platelet aggregation
the effects of  xxxd1747xxx  at oral doses ranging from 15 to 120 mg on platelet aggregation
were evaluated in a phase i placebo-controlled randomized study in 84 healthy adults. the
results of the study showed that  xxxd1747xxx  blocked platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent
fashion with an ic 50 of 93 nm without producing any adverse events (strasser et al. 2000).

hyponatremia
the effect of  xxxd1747xxx  in correcting hyponatremia was evaluated in three randomized,
double-blind placebo-controlled trials in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum [na+ ] 115 < 130 meq/l) (verbalis et al. 2005). in one intravenous trial
(027), patients (n = 74) received a 20-mg i.v. loading dose of  xxxd1747xxx  or a placebo
followed by continuous infusion of  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg or 80 mg/d or placebo for 4 days.
in two oral trials (026 and 043) patients (n = 74 and 83), respectively, were given oral
 xxxd1747xxx  40 or 80 mg a day or placebo in two divided doses for 5 days. patients were
placed on a fluid restriction < 2 l/d. the primary efficacy measure in all trials was the
change in serum [na+ ] from baseline to end of treatment, measured by the area under the
serum [na+ ] – time curve (auc). secondary measures included time from the first dose
to a confined ≥ 4 meq/l increase in serum [na+ ], total time serum [na+ ] was ≥ 4 meq/l
above baseline, and the number of patients demonstrating a confirmed ≥ 6 meq/l increase
in serum [na+ ] or normal serum [na+ ] (≥135 meq/l). in the published oral study (ghali
et al. 2006), 74 patients received  xxxd1747xxx  (40 or 80 mg/d) or placebo, and most patients
(68%) were 65 years or older and 75% of patients had euvolemic hyponatremia. the results
demonstrated that the least-squares mean change from baseline in the serum [na+ ] auc
with  xxxd1747xxx  was 2-fold ( p = 0.03) and 2.5-fold greater ( p < 0.001) for 40 and 80 mg/d
of  xxxd1747xxx , respectively, compared to placebo. the median time to achieve an increase
in serum [na+ ] of 4 meq/l or more from baseline was 71.7 h for placebo, 27.5 h for 40
mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  ( p = 0.04), and 12.1 h for 80 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  ( p = 0.002). similar values
for mean total times with serum [na+ ] levels 4 meq/l or more above baseline were 46.5,
69.8, and 88.8 h ( p = 0.001), respectively. the least-squares mean change in serum [na+ ]
from baseline to end of treatment was 3.4, 6.4, and 8.2 meq/l for placebo, 40 mg/d and

meq/l) or increase of 6 meq/l or more was observed in 48%, 71%, and 82%, respectively,
for placebo, 40 mg/d, and 80 mg/d of  xxxd1747xxx  ( p = 0.014) (fig. 3). headache, hypotension, constipation, nausea, and postural hypotension were the most common adverse events
(ghali 2007).
these studies have clearly shown that  xxxd1747xxx  was more effective than placebo on all
primary and secondary efficacy measures and was well tolerated.
the initial fda approval of  xxxd1747xxx  was for euvolemic hyponatremia.

heart failure
 xxxd1747xxx  was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study that enrolled 170 patients; of these 162 received treatment and had at least one efficacy
measure and 143 completed treatment (goldsmith 2006; goldsmith et al. 2007). patients
were randomized to  xxxd1747xxx  i.v. 40 mg (n = 40), 80 mg (n = 40), 120 mg (n = 42)

or placebo. efficacy measures included assessment of total urine output and changes from
baseline body weight at 24, 48, and 72 h and auc for total urine output at 72 h and change
from baseline in patient-assessed severity of respiratory symptoms at 48 h. compared to
placebo,  xxxd1747xxx  at all doses used caused significantly greater total urine output and
a trend for a decrease in body weight at 40 mg and 80 mg/d. however, there was no
improvement in patient assessment of clinical status.
in another report, data from three phase iii trials were combined and the effect of
 xxxd1747xxx  in the subset of patients with heart failure was analyzed retrospectively (ghali
et al. 2006). in one trial in patients with hyponatremia (serum [na+ ] < 130 meq)  xxxd1747xxx 
was administered i.v. (027) and in two other trials p.o. (026 and 043) with hyponatremia
(serum [na+ ] < 130 meq). of the 241 patients enrolled in the three studies 94 (39%) had
heart failure and 147 (61%) did not. in the intravenous trial, patients received a 20 mg i.v.
loading dose of  xxxd1747xxx  or placebo followed by continuous infusion of the drug at 40
or 80 mg/d or placebo for 4 days. in the two oral trials, patients received 40 or 80 mg/d or
placebo in two divided doses for 5 days.
significant improvement in all efficacy endpoints were similar in patients with hyponatremia with or without heart failure, including primary (change in serum [na+ ]
from baseline to end of treatment measured by auc) as well as secondary endpoints
(change in serum [na+ ], time from first dose to a confirmed ≥ 4 meq/l increase,
total time that serum [na+ ] was ≥ 4 meq/l above baseline, and the number of patients demonstrating confirmed ≥ 6 meq/l increase in serum [na+ ] or normal serum
[na+ ]).
one interesting finding from this analysis was the slower rate of serum [na+ ] correction
in patients with heart failure (median time 27.2 and 23.9 h for the 40 mg and 80 mg
doses, respectively) compared to those without heart failure (10.0 and 8.4 h, respectively).
a decrease in na+ delivery to the distal tubules in patients with heart failure is a likely
explanation of this finding.
the effect of  xxxd1747xxx  on exercise capacity and symptoms was evaluated in a large
(n = 343) double-blind, placebo-controlled study named a dose evaluation of a vasopressin
antagonist in chf patients undergoing exercise (advance). there was no significant
improvement in either symptoms or exercise duration among patients receiving  xxxd1747xxx 
compared to the placebo group (russell et al. 2003).
in another pilot study 24 patients with heart failure class ii/iii received 40 or 80 mg
q.d. of furosemide for 6 days followed by concomitant  xxxd1747xxx , 20 or 40 mg q.d. for
an additional three days (tonkon et al. 2001). the addition of  xxxd1747xxx  was associated
with a significant increase in free water clearance with limited natriuresis and kaliuresis,
suggesting that conivptan may be useful as an adjunct therapy to furosemide.
another important study was a hemodynamic, double-blind study of 142 patients (nyha
class iii and iv), who were randomized to a single intravenous dose of  xxxd1747xxx  (10, 20, or
40 mg) or placebo. a significant reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (pcwp)
as well as right atrial pressure with the administration of 20 and 40 mg doses was noted. no
correlation was found between baseline serum [na+ ] concentration and changes in pcwp
(udelson et al. 2001).
interestingly, no statistically significant correlation was found between changes in pcwp
and changes in urine output. this observation suggested that the decrease in pcwp was
related to v 1a rather than v 2 inhibition. however, no significant change was noted in cardiac
index or blood pressure, an expected finding from v 1a inhibition.

f. ali et al.

review of the available data indicates that  xxxd1747xxx  is effective in correcting hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, as well as in reducing right atrial pressure and
pcwp.
considering that the hemodynamic study was done in stable outpatients, it is conceivable
that patients presenting with acute decompensation would demonstrate a different response.
therefore, serious consideration should be given to further exploration of the role of  xxxd1747xxx  in the management of acute decompensated heart failure.

contraindications
in patients with hypovolemia or total body fluid depletion,  xxxd1747xxx  can potentially
precipitate renal failure, ischemic organ damage, and shock and is thus contraindicated.
combining  xxxd1747xxx  with other potent inhibitors of cyp3a4 such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and ritonivir is contraindicated but, if unavoidable, then all drug levels and their
individual side effects should be monitored.  xxxd1747xxx  is contraindicated in pregnancy
(category c). it can cross the placenta and in animal studies it has demonstrated fetal
growth delay; however, it has never been studied in pregnant women (burnier et al. 1999;
tahara et al 2005).  xxxd1747xxx  is also contraindicated in lactation as it has been found in
the milk of lactating animals. patients with hepatic or renal failure may require caution and
dose adjustment.

toxicology
rats and mice had no increased carcinogenesis at doses equivalent to two times and six
times, respectively, human systemic exposure at a 20 mg  xxxd1747xxx  i.v. bolus followed by
40 mg/d infusion for 3 days ( xxxd1747xxx  insert, 2006). in animal studies, reports of female
infertility and lengthened diestrus were seen at elevated doses without any effect on male
infertility.

side effects
in healthy volunteers and patients, infusion site reactions occurred in 52.5% subjects
treated with  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d compared to 3.3% in the placebo group. infusion site
reaction was the most common reason for discontinuation. although most infusion site
complications were minor including local inflammation, phlebitis, and pain at the infusion
site, some serious infusion site reactions did occur. other side effects in decreasing order
included headaches, hypokalemia, thirst, vomiting, polyuria, peripheral edema, diarrhea,
and orthostatic hypotension ( xxxd1747xxx  insert, 2006). using central tendency analysis, a
study looking at the effects of intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  on qt interval showed no effect
of  xxxd1747xxx . there is no evidence for potential psychogenic dependence on the drug
or its abuse. the side effects of  xxxd1747xxx  in a recent clinical trial are summarized in
table 2.

conclusion
 xxxd1747xxx  is a dual v 1a /v 2 avp receptor antagonist. currently it is the only avp
antagonist approved in its intravenous form for the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic
hyponatremia. its efficacy and short-term safety for this indication are well established. it
provides, therefore, an attractive option for the correction of euvolemic and hypervolemic
hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. further evaluation of the potential additional clinical
benefits of v 1a inhibition with  xxxd1747xxx  in patients with acute decompensated heart
failure should be considered.
