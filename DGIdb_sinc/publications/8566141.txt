abstract

amantadine ( xxxd136xxx ) induced fos expression in the central, dorsal-medial and ventral-medial part of the
striatum. the distribution pattern of fos induced by amantadine was more similar to those seen with dopaminomimetics than
with n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonists. pretreatment with the dopamine d~ receptor antagonist, sch23390,
and the nmda receptor antagonist, mk-801, blocked amantadine induction of fos in the striatum. however, amantadine
induction of fos in the striatum was unaffected by the dopamine d 2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride. these results suggest that
amantadine induction of fos in the rat striatum is related to dopamine d~ and nmda receptors.

1. introduction

amantadine ( xxxd136xxx ) has been used
clinically for the treatment of parkinson's disease. although the anti-parkinsonian effect of amantadine has
been generally attributed to the dopaminomimetic effect on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons (von voigtlander and moore, 1971), it was reported recently that
amantadine also has an antagonistic effect on the nmethyl-d-aspartate (nmda) type of  xxxg981xxx  (kornhuber et al., 1991, 1994). however, there have
been few in vivo investigations on whether amantadine
acts mainly as a dopaminomimetic or an n m d a antagonist in the striatum (mizogichi et al., 1994).
the  xxxg810xxx  encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein, fos, which modulates the transcription of
target genes (morgan and curran, 1991). the activation of c-fos is elicited by a variety of pharmacological
agents such as dopaminomimetics (graybiel et al., 1990;

liu et al., 1994), dopamine receptor antagonists (robertson and fibiger, 1992) and n m d a receptor antagonists (dragunow and faull, 1990), and each drug
induces a drug-specific c-los expression pattern. however, to our knowledge, it is still unknown whether
amantadine administration induces c-los expression in
the central nervous system.
to investigate the effect of amantadine in the striatum, experiments were designed (1) to map the expression of fos in the rat striatum after acute amantadine
administration, (2) to determine if there are any differences in the specific pattern of fos compared to that
with dopaminomimetics, cocaine, methamphetamine
and the n m d a antagonist, mk-801, and (3) to determine the roles of the dopamine receptor and the
n m d a receptor in the expression of c-fos induced by
acute amantadine injection.

in rabbit polyclonal igg (oncogene science, uniondale, usa) raised against the peptide corresponding to
residues 4-17 of human c-fos protein. the antibody
was diluted 1:400 in 0.01 m pbs containing 0.2%
triton x-100. next the sections were incubated for 1 h
at 4°c with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit igg (vector
laboratories, burlingame, usa). the reaction was visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzide and 0.01% h 2 0 2
in 50 mm tris-buffer (ph 7.6). after a final washing
with 0.01 m pbs, the sections were mounted on
chrome-alum-coated slides, dehydrated, and coverslipped with permount. the sections were studied by
brightfield microscopy and projection drawings were
made with a camera lucida.

receptor antagonist, d 2 receptor antagonist or nmda
receptor antagonist was administered 30 rain prior to
amantadine injection (20 mg/kg). amantadine injection after treatment with saline induced fos expression
in the central, dorsal-medial and ventral-medial part of
the striatum (fig. 2a). prior administration of the
dopamine d~ receptor antagonist, sch23390 (1
mg/kg), completely blocked amantadine induction of
fos in the striatum (fig. 2b). however, amantadine
induction of fos in the striatum was unaffected by the
dopamine d e receptor antagonist, sulpiride (100
mg/kg) (fig. 2c). prior administration of mk-801 (1
mg/kg) blocked amantadine induction of fos in the
striatum (fig. 2d).

4. discussion
3. results

3.1. patterns of fos expression in the striatum after
injections of amantadine, methamphetamine, cocaine or
mk-801
rats injected with saline alone showed no fos immunoreactive neurons in the striatum (not shown in
the figures). amantadine induced fos expression in the
striatum, as characterized by an intense black reaction
product in the nucleus (fig. 2a). at the rostal level of
the striatum, fos-positive neurons were prominent in
the central, dorsal-medial and ventral-medial part of
the striatum (fig. 1a). however, the dorsal-lateral and
ventral-lateral part of the striatum was free of the
fos-immunopositive neurons. with increasing doses of
amantadine (e.g., 100 mg/kg), a slight increase in the
number of fos-immunopositive neurons was noted in
the central region of the striatum, but not in the
dorsal-lateral and ventral-lateral part of the striatum
(not shown in the figures).
methamphetamine (4 mg/kg) and cocaine (10
mg/kg) also induced fos expression in the central,
dorsal-medial and ventral-medial part of the striatum
(fig. ib and c). the los expression pattern induced by
methamphetamine was more pronounced in the central
part of the striatum than that of amantadine or cocaine
(fig. 1b). however, the non-competitive nmda receptor antagonist, mk-801 (1 mg/kg), induced few fospositive neurons in the striatum (fig. 1d).
3.2. patterns of fos expression in the striatum after
injections of antagonists of dopamine d 1, d 2 and nmda
receptors followed by amantadine
to ascertain whether fos expression induced by
amantadine is related to striatal dopamine d 1, d 2 and
nmda receptors, saline (1 ml/kg), the dopamine d 1

the immediate early gene c-los is elicited by a
variety of drugs and each drug induces drug-specific
c-fos expression in the central nervous system. although the anti-parkinsonian effect of amantadine has
been attributed to a direct dopaminomimetic effect on
nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, recent studies suggest that amantadine has an nmda receptor antagonistic action (kornhuber et al., 1994), which indirectly increases the dopamine level in the striatum and
ameliorates the symptoms of parkinson's disease. we
have therefore studied whether the distribution pattern
of fos induced by amantadine resembles those induced
by dopaminomimetics or nmda receptor antagonists.
in the present study, amantadine induced fos expression in the rat striatum. the fos-immunopositive
neurons were prominent in the central, dorsal-medial
and ventral-medial part of the striatum after injections
of 10-100 mg/kg of amantadine, whereas the nmda
receptor antagonist, mk-801, in accordance with other
reports (dragunow and faull, 1990; kiba and jayaraman, 1994), induced no fos-immunopositive neurons in
the striatum. the distribution pattern of fos induced
by amantadine was more similar to those seen with
dopaminomimetics, cocaine and methamphetamine
than that induced by mk-801. these results suggest
that amantadine directly or indirectly stimulates nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. although amantadine is a non-competitive nmda receptor antagonist,
the g i value of amantadine at the pcp binding site of
the nmda receptor is 10 /zm (kornhuber et al.,
1991), indicating an about 105 times lower affinity than
mk-801. a recent study (abe et al., 1992) showed that
the nmda receptor antagonist, ketamine, which has a
20 times higher affinity than amantadine, blocks the
induction of fos in a dose-dependent manner. ketamine inhibits fos expression at doses of 100 mg/kg
and 150 mg/kg, but not at a dose of 50 mg/kg. taking
these results together, it may be possible that amanta-

s.-i. tomitaka et al. / european journal of pharmacology 285 (1995) 207-211

dine at a dose of 100 mg/kg does not have a strong
enough nmda receptor antagonistic effect to block
fos in the striatum.
in the present study, induction of fos by amantadine in the striatum was blocked by the dopamine d~
receptor antagonist, sch23390. however, amantadine
induction of fos was not affected by the dopamine d e
receptor antagonist, sulpiride. these results suggest
that amantadine increases the dopamine level in the
striatum and that dopamine induces fos in the striatal
neurons by activating dopamine d 1 receptors (robertson and fibiger, 1992). interestingly, it was reported
recently that c-los induction in the rat septum is unaffected by a dopamine d 1 receptor antagonist and an
nmda receptor antagonist (graybiel et al., 1990),
indicating a regional difference in the mechanism of
c-los expression.
in conclusion, our results showed that amantadine
induces fos expression in rat striatum and that amantadine induction of fos is mediated by activation of
dopamine d a receptors and blocked by the nmda
receptor antagonist, mk801.
