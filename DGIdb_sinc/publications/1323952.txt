 xxxg2312xxx  is an essential enzyme (9, 21, 23, 53)
that is required for chromosome structure (5, 13, 14, 16, 17),
condensation (1, 36, 52, 56), and segregation (9, 23, 47, 54).
it also appears to play roles in dna replication, transcription, and recombination in eukaryotic cells (3, 6, 8, 30, 39,
43, 47, 51, 55).
in addition to its cellular functions,  xxxg2312xxx  is the
primary target for several classes of antineoplastic drugs (32,
48, 59). these agents are widely used for the treatment of
human cancers (32, 48, 59) and their clinical efficacies
correlate with their abilities to stabilize covalent enzymecleaved dna complexes that are intermediates in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme (31, 32, 43, 48, 59). previous
studies with etoposide (40, 46) and  xxxd168xxx  ( xxxd168xxx ) (45, 46) demonstrated that these topoisomerase 1i-targeted drugs stabilize
cleavage complexes primarily by inhibiting the ability of the
enzyme to religate cleaved dna.
recent work indicates that the dna cleavage complex of
eukaryotic  xxxg2312xxx  is also a target for novel 6,8difluoroquinolone derivatives (4, 44). while quinolone-based
drugs have been developed extensively as antimicrobial
agents (targeted to  xxxg2311xxx , the prokaryotic counterpart
of  xxxg2312xxx ) (12, 24, 58), these studies provided
evidence that quinolones may have potential as antineoplastic drugs. one of the difluoro compounds examined, 6,8difluoro-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-cyclopropyl-4-quinolone-3carboxylic acid (cp-115,953) (see fig. 1), was twice as
*

as etoposide at enhancing  xxxg2312xxx -mediated
dna cleavage (44). in addition, the n-1 ethyl-substituted
derivative of cp-115,953, cp-67,804, was -80% as potent as
etoposide (46). however, in contrast to previously characterized drugs, neither quinolone inhibited the religation
reaction of the enzyme to a significant extent (44). thus,
quinolone-based compounds in the cp-115,953 series may
constitute a novel mechanistic class of topoisomerase iidirected drugs.
the vast majority of clinically important quinolone antimicrobial agents are fluorinated in the c-6 position (7, 24).
this fluorine appears to be critical for potent quinolone
action both in vitro and in vivo (7). although the requirement
for the c-6 fluorine has been well established (7), the
importance of the c-8 fluoro group in 6,8-difluoroquinolones
such as cp-115,953 is not yet known. therefore, the present
study examined the effects of a novel quinolone derivative,
cp-115,955, on the catalytic activities of drosophila melanogaster  xxxg2312xxx . this latter compound is identical
to cp-115,953 except for the substitution of the c-8 fluorine
with a hydrogen atom (see fig. 1). on the basis of enzymatic
and cytotoxicity assays, this substitution decreased the
potency of the drug by 2.2- to 3.3-fold. this finding indicates
that the presence of a fluorine in the c-8 position enhances
quinolone action against eukaryotic  xxxg2312xxx .

a previous study (m. j. robinson, b. a. martin, t. d. gootz, p. r. mcguirk, m. moynihan, j. a. sutcliffe,
and n. osheroff, j. biol. chem. 266:14585-14592, 1991) demonstrated that novel 6,8-difluoroquinolones were
potent effectors of eukaryotic  xxxg2312xxx . to determine the contribution of the c-8 fluorine to drug
potency, we compared the effects of cp-115,955 [6-fluoro-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-cyclopropyl-4-quinolone-3carboxylic acid] on the enzymatic activities of drosophila melanogaster  xxxg2312xxx  with those of
cp-115,953 (the 6,8-difluoro parent compound of cp-115,955). removal of the c-8 fluoro group decreased the
ability of the quinolone to enhance enzyme-mediated dna cleavage -2.5-fold. like its difluorinated
counterpart, cp-115,955 increased the levels of cleavage intermediates without impairing the dna religation
reaction of the enzyme. removal of the c-8 fluorine reduced the ability of the quinolone to inhibit
 xxxg2312xxx -catalyzed dna relaxation. in addition, the cytotoxicity of cp-115,955 towards chinese
hamster ovary cells was decreased compared with that of cp-115,953. these results demonstrate that the c-8
fluorine increases the potency of quinolone derivatives against eukaryotic  xxxg2312xxx  and mammalian
cells. further comparisons of cp-115,955 with cp-115,953 and cp-67,804 (the n-1 ethyl-substituted derivative
of the difluoro parent compound) indicate that the two intrinsic activities of quinolone-based drugs towards
 xxxg2312xxx  (i.e., enhancement of dna cleavage and inhibition of catalytic strand passage) can be
differentially influenced by alteration of ring substituents. finally, correlations between the biochemical and
cytological activities of these drugs suggest that the ability to inhibit catalytic strand passage enhances the
cytotoxic potential of quinolones towards eukaryotic cells.

for these studies. cell lines were the generous gifts of r.

(gibco-brl, gaithersburg, md.) (without antibiotics) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum.
results
while most quinolone-based drugs are poor effectors of
eukaryotic systems (12, 24, 58), the difluoroquinolone derivative cp-115,953 has potent activity against eukaryotic  xxxg2312xxx  and mammalian cell lines (44). because of the
antineoplastic potential of  xxxg2312xxx -targeted agents
(32, 48, 59), it is important to understand the relative
contributions of ring substituents to drug action. a previous
study demonstrated that substitution of an ethyl for the
cyclopropyl group in the n-1 position of cp-115,953 decreased its potency against eukaryotic  xxxg2312xxx  and
mammalian cells by 2.5- to 22-fold (44). to describe the
contributions of the c-8 fluoro group to quinolone action, we
examined the effects of cp-115,955 (in which the fluorine is
substituted by a hydrogen atom) on d. melanogaster  xxxg2312xxx . the structures of cp-115,955 and its parent
compound, cp-115,953, are shown in fig. 1.
effects of cp-115,955 on the dna cleavage/religation equilibrium of  xxxg2312xxx . the chemotherapeutic efficacies
of  xxxg2312xxx -targeted antineoplastic drugs correlate
with their abilities to enhance enzyme-mediated dna cleavage (i.e., to shift the dna cleavage/religation equilibrium of
the enzyme towards the cleavage event) (31, 32, 48, 59).
 xxxg2312xxx  establishes cleavage/religation equilibria
both before and after its double-stranded dna passage
event (38, 39, 43, 46). since strand passage requires atp
binding (39, 41, 43, 51, 55), the pre- and post-strand passage
equilibria of the enzyme can be separated experimentally.
the dna cleavage/religation equilibrium described here
were established in the absence of atp. therefore, the
following experiments examined the effects of cp-115,955 on
the pre-strand passage equilibrium of the enzyme.
as determined by the increase in linear (form iii) dna,
cp-115,955 was a less effective enhancer of topoisomerase
ii-mediated double-stranded dna cleavage than was cp115,953 (fig. 2). no drug-induced dna breakage was observed in the absence of the enzyme. to quantitate differences in potencies, we examined the effects of these
quinolones on the dna cleavage/religation equilibrium of
the enzyme over a range of drug concentrations (fig. 3). as
calculated from the linear portion of the concentration
curves (c50 ,im drug), cp-115,955 was -40% as potent as
cp-115,953. thus, removing the c-8 fluoro group decreased
the ability of the quinolone to enhance topoisomerase iimediated dna cleavage -2.5-fold.
despite its decreased potency relative to that of cp115,955, cp-115,955 was still highly active against the d.
melanogaster enzyme. indeed, this monofluoroquinolone

banding in cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradients (33).
quinolone derivatives cp-115,955 and cp-115,953 were synthesized by the procedure of gilligan et al. (18). cp-115,955
and cp-115,953 were dissolved as 25 mm solutions in 0.1 n
naoh, diluted to 5 mm stocks with 10 mm tris-hcl (ph
8.0), and stored in the dark at -80°c. etoposide ( xxxd2068xxx ;
 xxxd2068xxx -23) was purchased from bristol laboratories (evansville, ind.) as a sterile 20-mg/ml solution in 2-mg/ml citric
acid, 30-mg/ml benzyl alcohol, 80-mg/ml polysorbate 80tween 80, 650-mg/ml  xxxd2982xxx  300, and 30.5%

mo.), sodium  xxxd3215xxx  (sds) and proteinase k were
obtained from e. merck biochemicals (west point, pa.), and
atp was obtained from pharmacia lkb biotechnology
(piscataway, n.j.). all other chemicals were analytical

topoisomerase li-mediated dna cleavage. all dna cleavage reaction mixtures contained 50 to 100 nm topoisomerase
ii and 5 nm negatively supercoiled pbr322 dna in a total
volume of 20 pl of cleavage buffer (10 mm tris-hci [ph 7.9],
25 mm nacl, 50 mm kcl, 5 mm mgcl2, 0.1 mm edta,
2.5% glycerol). dna cleavage/religation equilibria were
established by incubating samples at 30°c for 6 min. cleavage products were trapped (15) by the addition of 2 ,ul of 10%
sds. one microliter of 250 mm edta and 2 pl of a
0.8-mg/ml solution of proteinase k were added, and samples
were incubated at 45°c for 30 min to digest  xxxg2312xxx .
final products were mixed with 2.5 pl of loading buffer (60%
sucrose, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol ff,
10 mm tris-hcl [ph 7.9]), and the mixture was heated at
70°c for 1 min and subjected to electrophoresis in 40 mm
tris-acetate (ph 8.3) and 2 mm edta in 1% agarose (em
science, gibbstown, n.j.) gels. following electrophoresis,
dna bands were stained in a 1-,ug/ml solution of ethidium
bromide and visualized by transillumination with uv light
(300 nm). dna bands were photographed through kodak
23a and 12 filters with polaroid type 665 positive-negative
film. the amount of dna was quantitated by scanning
negatives with an e-c apparatus model ec910 scanning
densitometer using hoefer gs-370 data system software.
under the conditions used, the intensity of the bands in the
negatives was directly proportional to the amount of dna
present. the effects of drugs were examined over a concentration range of 0 to 150 ,um. an amount of diluent equal to
that in drug-containing samples was added to all control
samples. none of the diluents affected the topoisomerase
ii-mediated dna cleavage/religation equilibrium.

reaction mixtures contained 50 to 100 nm  xxxg2312xxx 
and 5 nm negatively supercoiled pbr322 dna in a total
volume of 20 p,l of cleavage buffer. initial dna cleavage/
religation equilibria were established at 30°c for 6 min.
 xxxg2312xxx -mediated religation of cleaved dna was
induced by rapidly shifting samples from 30 to 55°c (27, 28,
42, 46). religation was terminated by the addition of sds
(1% final concentration) at various time points up to 20 s.
samples were treated with edta and proteinase k as
described above. reaction products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitated as described above.
the effects of drugs on  xxxg2312xxx -mediated dna
religation were examined by the addition of 100 ,um cp115,955, 50 p,m cp-115,953, or 100 ,um etoposide to reaction
mixtures. drugs were added during the initial enzyme-dna

11).
effects of cp-115,955 on the ability of  xxxg2312xxx  to
religate cleaved dna. although the difluoroquinolone cp115,953 and its n-1 ethyl-substituted derivative cp-67,804
increase the levels of  xxxg2312xxx -dna cleavage complexes, they show little ability to inhibit the dna religation

reaction of the enzyme (44). this finding suggests that these
compounds enhance the levels of dna breakage primarily
by stimulating the forward rate of dna cleavage. this is in
marked contrast to the results obtained with topoisomerase
ii-targeted antineoplastic drugs such as etoposide (40, 46)
and  xxxd168xxx  (45, 46), which appear to stabilize cleavage
intermediates primarily by inhibiting enzyme-mediated dna
religation. to determine whether the c-8 fluoro group influences the mechanism of quinolone action, we monitored the
effects of cp-115,955 on the ability of  xxxg2312xxx  to
religate cleaved dna (prior to strand passage) by using a
heat-induced dna religation assay (27, 28, 42, 46). this
assay takes advantage of the fact that the religation reaction
of  xxxg2312xxx  is less sensitive to variations in temperature than is its cleavage reaction (27, 28, 42, 46). thus, after
establishment of the dna cleavage/religation equilibrium at
30°c (the optimal reaction temperature for d. melanogaster
 xxxg2312xxx  [41]), shifting samples to 55°c leads to the
time-dependent conversion of doubly-cleaved linear dna
back to its original supercoiled state (42, 46).

was -80% as potent as etoposide (a widely used  xxxg2312xxx -targeted antineoplastic drug [32, 48, 59]) at stimulating dna cleavage (40, 44, 46).
in addition to its activity against the eukaryotic type ii
enzyme, cp-115,955 was also a potent effector of e. coli
gyrase (data not shown). the minimal concentration of
cp-115,955 required to induce gyrase-mediated dna cleavage was 0.24 ,um, compared with 0.60 ,um for ciprofloxacin
(4) (the most potent gyrase-targeted antimicrobial agent
currently in clinical use [2, 24]). the minimal concentration
of the difluoro parent compound, cp-115,953, required to
induce gyrase-mediated dna cleavage was 0.22 ,um. thus,
removal of the c-8 fluorine had little effect on the potency of
the quinolone towards the prokaryotic enzyme. a similar
observation was made previously by comparing the potencies of the c-8 fluoro derivatives of norfloxacin,  xxxd2858xxx ,
and ciprofloxacin with those of their parent compounds (10,

dna religation are shown in fig. 4. data for cp-115,953 and
etoposide are shown for comparison. clearly, cp-115,955
did not impair the dna religation reaction of the enzyme. in
contrast, etoposide inhibited. this reaction -9-fold at the
same drug concentration. therefore, the substitution of
hydrogen for fluorine at the c-8 position decreases quinolone
potency but does not alter the mechanism of drug action.
to further confirm this finding, we analyzed the effects of
cp-115,955 by using a'second dna religation system (data
not shown). this second system relies on the fact that
calcium can be used to trap topqisomerase ii-dna cleavage
complexes in a kinetically active form (40, 42, 45, 57). once
again, cp-115,955 showed little ability to inhibit enzymemediated dna religation (compared with etoposide, which
inhibited dna religation -3-fold in this system [401).
inhibition of  xxxg2312xxx -catalyzed dna relaxation by
cp-115,955. a number 'of quinolone-based drugs inhibit the
catalytic dna strand passage reaction of eukaryotic  xxxg2312xxx  (4, 20, 25, 26, 29, 34, 35, 37, 41). the most
potent compound reported to date is cp-115,953, which

(44).
in a previous study, the vpm"-5 line showed only low
(-1.3-fold) cross-resistance to cp-115,953 (ec50 =12 ,um)
(46). removal of the c-8 fluoro group increased the resistance of vpmr-5 cells to this quinolone series (ec50 of
cp-115,955, '40 ,im) to -2.0-fold (table 1). the crossresistance of vpmrj5 cells to cp-115,955, albeit' low, suggests that  xxxg2312xxx  is a physiological target for this
quinolone in mammalian cells.

discussion
quinolone-based drugs represent some of the most effective antimicrobial agents currently in clinical use (2, 12, 24,
58). most members of this drug class show little potency
against eukaryotic systems (12, 24, 58). however, two novel
6,8-difluoroqui.nolones, cp-115,953'and'cp-67,804, recently
were found to be potent effectors of d. melanogaster and
calf thymus  xxxg2312xxx  (44). cp-115,953 was the more
active of the two compounds. it was about two times more
potent than etoposide at enhancing  xxxg2312xxx -mediated dna cleavage and displayed cytotoxicity towards cho
cells that was comparable to that of the antineoplastic drug.
although the importance of the c-6 fluoro group to quinolone potency has been well documented (7), little is known

the second was vpmr-5, a cho cell line selected for
resistance against epipodophyllotoxins (22). compared with
cho cells, vpmr-5 cells are 10- to 20-fold resistant to
etoposide (a representative epipodophyllotoxin) (19, 22, 44),
and they show broad cross-resistance to a number of topoisomerase ti-targeted antineoplastic drugs (19, 22). drug
resistance in this line results from the presence of a mutated,
resistant type ii enzyme, rather than a decrease in drug
uptake (19, 22, 50).
substitution of a hydrogen atom for the c-8 fluorine
decreased quinolone cytotoxicity towards wild-type cho
cells -2.2-fold (table 1). the effective concentration of
cp-115,955 required to kill 50% of the cells (ec50) was -20

lished.
the two intrinsic activities of quinolone-based drugs (i.e.,
enhancement of dna cleavage and inhibition of catalytic
strand passage) (12, 24, 58) can be differentially influenced
by the alteration of ring substituents. although substitutions
at the c-8 and n-1 positions (table 1) had similar effects on
dna cleavage, the n-1 substitution increased the ic50 of the
quinolone for dna relaxation to a greater extent. given the
relationships between dna cleavage, dna strand passage,
and cytotoxicity, the ability to differentially alter drug activities by specific ring substitutions may significantly affect
future quinolone design.
gyrase-targeted quinolones have been developed exclusively as antimicrobial agents (2, 12, 24, 58). even the most
potent gyrase-targeted drug in clinical use, ciprofloxacin,
shows only limited activity towards eukaryotic topoisomerase
11 (4). the series of fluoroquinolones described in table 1 are
novel in their high potency towards both gyrase and the eukaryotic type ii enzyme. considering the antineoplastic potential of these compounds, it is important to establish structureactivity relationships for different ring substituents within the
series. the results of the present study indicate that the c-8
fluoro group contributes to the potency of these compounds
against eukaryotic  xxxg2312xxx  and mammalian cells.

concerning the contribution of the c-8 fluorine to the actions
of these 6,8-difluoro compounds. to clarify the role of this
ring substituent, we compared the activities of the 6-monofluoroquinolone, cp-115,955, towards d. melanogaster  xxxg2312xxx  and cho cells with those of its 6,8-difluoro
parent compound, cp-115,953. in all cases, substitution of a
hydrogen atom for the c-8 fluorine decreased quinolone
potency 2.2- to 3.3-fold (table 1). as observed previously
with cp-115,953 and cp-67,804 (44), cp-115,955 stimulated
 xxxg2312xxx -mediated dna cleavage without inhibiting
the dna religation reaction of the enzyme. therefore,
cp-115,955 belongs to the same mechanistic class as the
difluoro compounds described above.
the presence of the c-8 fluorine enhanced quinolone activity towards both eukaryotic  xxxg2312xxx  and mammalian
cells. however, it did not affect the potency of the drug
towards  xxxg2311xxx . in other studies (10, 11), this fluoro
group has been correlated with decreased quinolone activity
against gyrase and/or bacterial cells. thus, the c-8 fluorine
appears to be specific for eukaryotic systems. this finding
makes the c-8 position a potential target for the future
development of quinolone-based antineoplastic agents.
the cytotoxic effects of topoisomerase ti-targeted antineoplastic agents and gyrase-targeted antimicrobial agents have
been correlated to their enhancement of enzyme-mediated
dna cleavage (2, 12, 24, 31, 58). however, cp-115,955 was
3.5 times more cytotoxic towards cho cells than was cp67,804, despite the fact that both were equally potent at increasing levels of enzyme-dna cleavage complexes (table
1). this finding suggests that other drug actions may contribute to cytotoxicity. to this point, cp-115,955 was 2.5 times
more potent at inhibiting enzyme-catalyzed dna relaxation
than was cp-67,804 (table 1). since the double-stranded
dna passage reaction of  xxxg2312xxx  is essential to cell
survival (9, 21, 23, 39, 43, 51, 53, 55), it is tempting to
speculate that the ability of quinolones to inhibit this activity
contributes to their cytotoxic potential. it will be necessary to
fully characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of these
quinolone-based drugs, however, before correlations between
this inhibitory activity and cell death can be firmly estab-
