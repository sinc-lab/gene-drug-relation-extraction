abstract
monosodium urate crystals stimulate monocytes and
macrophages to release  xxxg1170xxx  through the  xxxg1567xxx  component
of the inflammasome. the effectiveness of il-1 inhibition in
hereditary autoinflammatory syndromes with mutations in the
 xxxg1567xxx  protein suggested that il-1 inhibition might also be
effective in relieving the inflammatory manifestations of acute
gout. the effectiveness of il-1 inhibition was first evaluated in a
mouse model of monosodium urate crystal-induced
inflammation. il-1 inhibition prevented peritoneal neutrophil
accumulation but tnf blockade had no effect. based on these

findings, we performed a pilot, open-labeled study (trial
registration number isrctn10862635) in 10 patients with
gout who could not tolerate or had failed standard
antiinflammatory therapies. all patients received 100 mg
anakinra daily for 3 days. all 10 patients with acute gout
responded rapidly to anakinra. no adverse effects were
observed. il-1 blockade appears to be an effective therapy for
acute gouty arthritis. the clinical findings need to be confirmed
in a controlled study.

introduction

on assembly of the inflammasome, which consists of a member of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-leucine
rich repeat protein family (such as nalp1, nalp2,  xxxg1567xxx , or
ipaf), the adaptor protein asc and  xxxg340xxx  [7],  xxxg340xxx 
becomes active and cleaves pro- xxxg1170xxx  to release the mature
p17 form of  xxxg1170xxx . activators of the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome
include atp, the microbial cell-wall component muramyl
dipeptide and bacterial rnas [8-10]. msu and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals directly activate the inflammasome via  xxxg1567xxx  in monocytes or macrophages to release
active  xxxg1170xxx  and cause neutrophil influx into the peritoneal
space when administered by intraperitoneal injection. these
responses were abrogated in asc-/- or  xxxg340xxx -/- mice [6].

acute gout is a common cause of arthritis, affecting approximately 1% of the adult population, and epidemiological evidence suggests that its prevalence is increasing [1]. current
treatments during an acute attack include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), colchicine and corticosteroids.
although these agents are generally effective, they also
present significant risks in patients who have pre-existing
renal, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases.
gouty inflammation is due to monosodium urate (msu) crystal-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines from leukocytes. among the many cytokines implicated [2,3], il-1 may
have a special role in the inflammatory network, as msu crystals stimulate il-1 release by monocytes and synovial mononuclear cells [4]. the msu crystals trigger il-1 release through
innate immune pathways, which include tlr-2 and  xxxg2290xxx ,
found on the surface of monocytes and macrophages, as well
as the 'inflammasome' complex that leads to  xxxg1170xxx  activation
[5,6]. the inflammasome acts as an intracellular sensor of
inflammatory stimuli and regulates the activation of  xxxg340xxx .

spontaneous activation of the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome due to
mutations in the  xxxg1567xxx  gene has been implicated in hereditary autoinflammatory syndromes such as muckle–wells syndrome and chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous articular
[11]. affected patients respond dramatically to il-1 inhibition
[12,13], suggesting that  xxxg1170xxx  plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammation in these conditions. based on these

il = interleukin; mab = monoclonal antibody; msu = monosodium urate; nalp = nacht, lrr and pyrin domain containing protein; nsaid = nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug; pbs = phosphate-buffered saline; tlr = toll-like receptor; tnf =  xxxg2296xxx .

findings, we questioned whether il-1 inhibition may also have
a beneficial effect in gouty inflammation.
as treatment with drugs currently used in acute gout is not
always well tolerated or is contraindicated due to coexistent
medical problems, we investigated the validity of il-1 blockade
as therapy in acute gout. we first analyzed the effects of il-1
inhibition using the mouse peritoneal model of msu-induced
inflammation and then assessed the effects of anakinra in
patients with acute gout who presented contraindications or
were refractory to standard treatment in an open study.

ticosteroids continued their treatment at the same dose. clinical efficacy was assessed by clinical examination of the
swollen and tender joint count as well as the patient's evaluation of the efficacy of treatment in terms of pain reduction after
3 days of therapy in comparison with their symptoms before
treatment. all patients were followed up for >1 month. during
follow-up, patients were evaluated for side-effects related to
the treatment and for joint symptoms related to gout. all
patients were followed by physicians responsible for this study
(as and sr). the study protocol was approved by the local
institution's ethics committee and has the isrtcn trial registration number 10862635.

methods
reagents
msu crystals were prepared based on the method described
previously [14]. briefly, 1.68 g  xxxd3472xxx  was dissolved in 500
ml of 0.01 m naoh and heated to 70°c. naoh was added as
required to maintain the ph between 7.1 and 7.2, and the solution was filtered and incubated at room temperature with little
stirring slowly and continuously 24 hours.
animal studies
balb/c mice were treated intraperitoneally with pbs or 0.5
mg msu crystals in 0.5 ml sterile pbs. some mice were
injected intraperitoneally with 200 mug anti-il-1ri mab (clone
35f5; bd pharmingen, san jose, ca, usa) or with 200 mug
anti-tnf mab (clone tn3-19.12; bd pharmingen) or with 200
mug anakinra (kineret; amgen, thousand oaks, ca, usa) at
the time of msu injection. mice were euthanized after 6 hours
by co2 exposure and the peritoneal cavities were washed
with 10 ml cold pbs. the lavage fluids were analyzed for neutrophil recruitment by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using
the neutrophil markers ly-6g and  xxxg1206xxx  (bd pharmingen).
five mice per group were used for study.
human studies
the diagnosis of gout arthritis was based on clinical and laboratory features. all patients fulfilled the american college of
rheumatology criteria for acute gouty arthritis [15], but all had
a long previous history of either recurrent gouty attacks or
tophaceous gout. patients were treated with anakinra on an
open-label basis. all subjects had either failed conventional
treatment with nsaids, colchicine or corticosteroids for at
least 48 hours or had developed significant side-effects on
these drugs in the past. patients with an active untreated infection, with uncontrolled diabetes, with uncontrolled heart or respiratory failure or with chronic renal failure with a creatinine
clearance <30 ml/min were not eligible. joint infection was
excluded by prior bacterial culture in all cases that underwent
joint aspiration.

all patients consented to receive anakinra. treatment was
administered daily at a dose of 100 mg subcutaneously for 3
days. on starting anakinra, the nsaid or colchicine therapy
was discontinued. patients who were already on low-dose cor-

results
msu-induced peritoneal inflammation and its inhibition
by anakinra or anti-il-1ri mab
to study the inflammatory response to msu crystals in vivo,
we used a well-described model of neutrophil infiltration in the
peritoneal cavity subsequent to msu crystal administration. in
previous experiments we determined that intraperitoneal
administration of msu crystals induced a dose-dependent
neutrophil accumulation at the site of crystal deposition, with a
plateau effect observed at 500 mug (data not shown), and this
dose was therefore used in subsequent experiments. we went
on to determine whether il-1 blockade reduced the inflammatory response in the same model. coadministration of msu
crystals with two different il-1 inhibitors (anti-il-1ri mab or  xxxg1171xxx  antagonist (anakinra)) had similar and marked inhibitory
effects on neutrophil recruitment (figure 1a). this effect was
not observed when anti-tnf blocking mab was administered
in the same fashion as the il-1 inhibitors (figure 1b). the differences were statistically significant in comparison with the
positive msu control.

the same dose of tnf inhibitor was effective in suppressing
liver inflammation induced by concavalin a administration, a
model of hepatitis dependent on tnf production (data not
shown).
effects of anakinra in gout patients
the effectiveness of il-1 inhibition in suppressing the symptoms of acute gout was assessed in 10 patients who could not
tolerate or did not respond to standard antiinflammatory treatments. a summary of the medical histories is presented in
table 1. all patients responded rapidly to the drug, with the
most rapid onset observed within 24 hours. in all patients, subjective symptoms of gout were greatly relieved by 48 hours
after the first injection. no side-effects were observed during
the study period. clinical examination of affected joints
showed complete resolution of signs of arthritis in 9/10
patients on day 3 after initiation of treatment.
case 1
a 72-year-old woman with a 13-year history of chronic tophaceous gout and hyperuricemia was treated with rasburicase.

inhibition of monosodium urate-induced peritoneal neutrophil influx by anti-il-1 treatment
treatment. (a) balb/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5
mg monosodium urate (msu) crystals together with pbs or anti-il-1ri mab (200 mug) or anakinra (200 mug). (b) balb/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 mg msu crystals together with pbs or anti-tnf mab (200 mug) or anakinra (200 mug). neutrophil influx in the peritoneum was
quantified 6 hours later. values are the mean ± standard error of the mean of five mice per group. an unpaired student's t test was used to calculate
the p value.

the patient previously had a severe cutaneous reaction to
allopurinol, and uricosuric treatment with benzbromazone
caused renal stones. during previous gout flares, medical
treatment was unsatisfactory. she could only tolerate a low
dose of diclofenac (50–100 mg/day), as higher doses caused
gastrointestinal side-effects including one episode of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. colchicine at 1 mg/day provoked intolerable diarrhea, and oral corticosteroid caused severe
abdominal pain.
 xxxg2390xxx  treatment was commenced (14 mg intravenously daily
for 5 days) and resulted in rapid lowering of the patient's uric
acid levels. on the fourth day of treatment, arthritis developed
in her hand and foot joints. as treatment with diclofenac during
previous flares took more than 1 week to relieve her
symptoms, treatment with anakinra was started. her arthritis
responded rapidly and she was able to continue the course of
 xxxg2390xxx . no acute flares were observed during the following 2
months.
case 2
a 70-year-old man with an 8-year history of chronic tophaceous gout was assessed for hypouricemic treatment. the
patient's past medical history included congestive cardiac failure, severe ischemic heart disease, hypertension and renal
insufficiency (serum creatinine, 202 mumol/l; normal range, 44–

80 mumol/l). previous trials of treatment with allopurinol had to
be abandoned because acute gout developed after the first
dose, which did not respond to small doses of nsaids. higher
doses of nsaids were contraindicated because of renal failure. colchicine at low doses (<1 mg/day) provoked rapid
onset of diarrhea.
the patient was again started on a low dose of allopurinol
(100 mg), and after the first dose developed acute arthritis of
the right foot and ankle. anakinra was administered for 3 days
with rapid and complete resolution of signs and symptoms of
arthritis. the patient continued on allopurinol 100 mg daily,
and at follow-up 2 months later he had no further flare-ups
while continuing on the same dose of allopurinol.
case 3
a 72-year-old man with a past history of diabetes, hypertension, renal failure and ischemic heart disease presented with
polyarticular gout. arthritis involved the knees, the right ankle
and the right tarsal joints. msu crystals were detected in the
knee joint aspirate.

owing to renal impairment and a history of rectal bleeding on
colchicine, treatment with oral prednisone at 30 mg daily was
started with a tapering dose over 7 days. despite steroids, the
arthritis remained active and the patient could not walk. after

steroids were stopped, the patient received a 3-day course of
anakinra, with complete resolution of arthritis by the second
day. there had been no recurrence of arthritis at follow-up 1
month later.
case 4
a 50-year-old man with a 20-year history of polyarticular gout
principally involving the right ankle and big toe sought medical
advice because of increasingly frequent gout attacks. he had
started allopurinol but could not continue treatment because it
induced flare-ups of arthritis. nsaids caused severe gastrointestinal pain, and colchicine at 1 mg daily was ineffective.
higher doses of colchicine provoked diarrhea. on examination, he had arthritis of the right ankle joint and msu crystals
were identified in the joint aspirate.

a trial of anakinra was initiated at the same time as starting
allopurinol (300 mg/day). the patient's arthritis responded
rapidly and he continued on allopurinol. he was asymptomatic
2 months later.
case 5
a 40-year-old man with a 12-year history of gout presented
with recurrent podagra of the right big toe. the attacks
occurred approximately once every 2 months, and responded
normally to indomethacin 150 mg daily over 7 days. the
patient was taking allopurinol 300 mg daily and his  xxxd3472xxx 
level was stable at 322 mumol/l. he could not tolerate colchicine, which induced diarrhea when given at doses above 1.5
mg daily.

page 4 of 6
(page number not for citation purposes)

the patient consulted after another attack, which did not
respond to indomethacin over 2 days. joint aspiration confirmed the presence of urate crystals in the joint fluid. the
patient received anakinra and his symptoms completely
resolved 36 hours after the first injection. he has had no further attacks at the 6-week follow-up.
case 6
a 73-year-old female presented with acute gout involving the
big toes of both feet for the first time. she had a past medical
history of hypertension and knee osteoarthritis. on examination, both metatarsophalangeal-1 joints were red and swollen
and tender to the touch. the joint aspirate did not yield any
fluid. serum  xxxd3472xxx  was raised at 572 mumol/l and serum creatinine was normal at 72 mumol/l. a presumptive diagnosis of
acute gout was made because of the patient's clinical presentation and the hyperuricemia.

the patient's symptoms had not responded to 2 days of treatment with diclofenac (100 mg daily), so anakinra was started.
her joint pains were 50% improved by 24 hours and 80% by
36 hours after the injections. no further recurrence was
reported on follow-up at 1 month. the patient was started subsequently on allopurinol.
case 7
a 76-year-old man developed polyarticular gout affecting his
right ankle, the right tarsal joint and both big toe joints during
hospitalization for acute cholecystitis and bacterial sepsis. the
patient had a past medical history of cardiovascular disease
treated with low-dose aspirin and nitrates, of hypertension, of
obstructive airway disease and of cirrhosis. on examination,

available online http://arthritis-research.com/content/9/2/r28

joint inflammation was observed at the aforementioned
affected sites. aspiration of the ankle joint revealed  xxxd3472xxx 
crystals.
owing to a lack of response to nsaids over 48 hours, anakinra treatment was started. the patient responded after the
first injection, and the symptoms and signs of gout were completely abolished 48 hours afterwards.
case 8
a 70-year-old man developed arthritis of his right wrist, elbow,
hand and shoulder. the patient's past medical history included
chronic renal failure, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease
with atrial fibrillation. gout was suspected because of hyperuricemia and he was treated with colchicine, which provoked
rectal bleeding and a worsening of renal failure. the patient's
serum urate was raised at 779 mumol/l and his serum creatinine
was 258 mumol/l. the joint aspiration of the left elbow revealed
msu crystals.

a trial of treatment with prednisone caused a decompensation
of the patient's diabetes. anakinra was started and on review,
after completing the injections, the symptoms of arthritis of the
knee and elbow were greatly reduced, but the right wrist and
hand remained moderately painful.
case 9
a 53-year-old male presented with severe tophaceous gout of
17 years' duration. in the past, treatment with allopurinol and
uricosurics had been attempted but discontinued because
treatment provoked acute attacks of gout that were not well
controlled by nsaids. colchicine caused severe diarrhea at a
dose of 1 mg/day. there was a positive family history of gout.
on examination, tophi were detected over the elbows, fingers,
knees, ankles and feet, with signs of inflammation in the hands,
knees and right foot. the patient's serum urate was increased
at 660 mumol/l and his renal function was normal.

owing to the patient's prior intolerance of nsaids and colchicine, a further attempt to start allopurinol was made under
cover of anakinra, given at 100 mg daily over 3 days. on starting anakinra, the patient reported a 50% decrease in joint
pains after 2 days and he started allopurinol 200 mg daily and
acetametacin 90 mg daily without complications. on follow-up
1 month later, the patient had one minor attack of gout and the
allopurinol was continued.
case 10
a 38-year-old male presented with painful arthritis of the left
wrist. in the past, the left wrist was fractured in a road traffic
accident and the patient also had a past history of gout affecting the ankles and the left knee. aspiration of the left wrist
showed msu crystals. colchicine (2 mg/day) over 5 days was
not effective in controlling the symptoms of gout.

anakinra was administered and there was a rapid clinical
response. on follow-up at day 7 after the first injection, the left
wrist was still slightly swollen and tender but the ankle and
knee were asymptomatic. the patient was subsequently
started on allopurinol.

discussion
msu crystals induce tissue inflammation via multiple mechanisms. the release of monocyte-derived cytokines, triggered
by urate crystals, can in turn modulate endothelial expression
of adhesion molecules that enhance neutrophil recruitment to
the site of inflammation [16]. within the joint, the release of
chemokines, prostanoids as well as kinins further amplifies the
inflammatory response [17]. the recent finding that msu crystals induce il-1 release by activation of the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome led us to investigate whether il-1 blockade could inhibit
inflammation provoked by msu. our results from animal studies confirmed the effectiveness of il-1 inhibition in preventing
neutrophil trafficking to the peritoneum, whereas tnf inhibition did not have any effect. indeed, tnf inhibition aggravated
neutrophil influx. at present we do not have any simple explanation for the apparent increase in neutrophil accumulation in
mice treated with the anti-tnf mab. this observation was
made in the two separate experiments performed with five animals per group. the anti-tnf agent employed inhibited concavalin a-induced hepatitis, demonstrating that the reagent is
biologically active.
the latter results differed from those reported by chapman
and colleagues, who found that anti-tnf inhibited msuinduced endothelial activation, as evidenced by scintigraphy,
in a porcine monoarthritis model [16]. these differences may
be due to the different species employed in the animal models
as well as to the differences in the cytokine inhibitors tested.
apart from the inflammasome, il-1 secretion by macrophages
in contact with msu can also be induced through a tlrdependent mechanism [5]. in the current experiments, il-1
inhibitors would block the effects of activation via both the tlr
and the inflammasome pathways.
as proof of concept that il-1 inhibition may be clinically effective, we performed an open-label study of anakinra treatment
in patients with acute gout. all patients had acute excacerbations of longstanding gout and three had severe tophaceous
gout. all the patients had either not responded adequately to
standard treatment with nsaids, colchicine or steroids (n = 7)
or had significant comorbidities that made use of these treatments hazardous (n = 4). three patients could not continue
hypouricemic treatment with allopurinol because of the acute
flares provoked at the start of treatment. only three daily injections were administered, and in all cases the symptoms of gout
responded rapidly. all patients had responded within 48
hours, and in four patients (cases 2, 3, 4 and 10) the symptoms improved within 24 hours. patients' subjective assessment of pain due to gout was positive, and the mean

diminution of pain was 79% by day 3 after the first injection.
not all patients responded so well, particularly in two of the
patients who had tophaceous gout. they had a moderate
response, although still with >50% reduction of pain. as il-1
blockade may increase the risk of infection, we excluded any
patient who had proven or clinically suspected active infection.
when appropriate, joint aspiration was performed to exclude
septic arthritis. no treatment-related side-effects were
observed during therapy and there were no infectious
complications. on follow-up, three patients who had tophaceous gout reported mild joint pains but no acute flare during
the first month.

although these findings are positive, we have to stress that
this was an open-label study and confirmation of these results
would require a randomized controlled trial to prove that il-1
inhibition is effective in acute gout. if the effectiveness of il-1
is confirmed, then a short course of il-1 inhibition may prove
to be a valid addition to the therapeutic arsenal when the physician is confronted with complicated cases of gouty arthritis.

conclusion
in this pilot study involving 10 patients with gouty arthritis
refractory to conventional therapies, anakinra given at 100 mg
daily for 3 days rapidly relieved the inflammatory symptoms of
gout. these results reinforce the findings that implicate  xxxg1170xxx 
in the pathophysiology of gout and need to be confirmed by
randomized controlled trials. il-1 inhibition may be a promising
therapeutic target in crystal-induced arthritis.
