acetylcholine is the predominant neurotransmitter in the neuromuscular junction, and a role in bone has
been postulated. the expression of nicotinic receptors has been reported in osteoblasts, but the expression
and function of muscarinic receptor in bone remain obscure. in this study, we investigated the expression and
functional activities of muscarinic receptor subtypes in human osteoblast cell lines and animal and human
bone tissue. the mrna levels of muscarinic receptor subtypes were detected by reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction. we found that muscarinic subtypes m1, m2, m3, m4, and m5 were expressed at
different levels in human osteosarcoma hos cells, rat femur, and human rib bone tissue; m1, m4, m5 were in
cultured mouse femur bone cells and cultured mouse calvarial bone cells; m2, m3, m4 were in bovine bone.
the mrna of neuronal markers, light-, medium- and heavy-neuroﬁlament, was not found in human bone
tissues to exclude the possible contamination from neuronal tissue.  xxxd2586xxx  induced an elevation in
cytosolic calcium concentration and proliferation in hos cells. both effects were blocked by atropine. we
conclude that muscarinic receptor is present in bone tissue to evoke calcium signaling and modulate cell
proliferation. different muscarinic receptor subtypes are distributed in various parts of the animal skeletal
system including the different species and bone portions. bone remodeling involving osteoblast proliferation
leads the possibilities that muscarinic receptor may play roles in bone remodeling.

1. introduction
the vertebrate skeleton is richly innervated with peripheral nerve
terminals. it has been proposed that signaling molecules in the nervous
system participate in the control of bone metabolism. adrenergic and
neuropeptide receptors have been shown to be expressed in osteoblast
and osteoclast cells (huang et al., 2009; kundu et al., 1999; takeda et al.,
2002; togari, 2002; togari et al., 1997). a neuro-osteogenic pathway has
been proposed. in addition to bone metabolism, bone differentiation has
been proposed to be linked to neuronal signaling. diffusible axon
guidance molecules, acting as chemoattractants and chemorepellents,
guide the growth of nerve ﬁbers within the bone (togari, 2002; togari
and arai, 2008). it is known that the adrenergic pathway plays some
roles in bone tissue. however, the role of the cholinergic pathway, which
is predominant in the neuronal system, remains obscure in bone tissue.
bone remodeling is controlled by endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine mechanisms. in recent years, acetylcholine has been demonstrated
to be synthesized and secreted by nonneuronal as well as neuronal
tissues (fujii et al., 2009; galea and estrada, 1991; proskocil et al., 2004).
acetylcholine is synthesized by the action of  xxxg440xxx 
on acetyl-coa, and signaling is terminated by acetylcholinesterase,

which hydrolyzes acetylcholine to choline and acetate. acetylcholinesterase has been reported to be expressed by osteoblasts (grisaru et al.,
1999; inkson et al., 2004), and the presence of acetylcholinesterase in
osteoblast adhesion and differentiation may reﬂect the presence of
acetylcholine receptors. however, the roles of acetylcholine in bone are
unclear.
acetylcholine receptors are categorized into 2 classes: muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors, including 5 distinct receptors coupled to
heteromeric g proteins; and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors comprised of different subunits that assemble to form a cation channel. luo
and his colleagues used in situ hybridization to investigate the
distribution of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the inner ear of rats
and identiﬁed alpha9 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors subunit mrna
expression in developing osteoblasts and/or chondrocytes in the
cochlear capsule (luo et al., 1998). others have reported the expression
of alpha7 and  xxxg833xxx  nicotinic acetylcholine receptors subunit mrnas in
periosteal cells and human primary bone (romano et al., 1997; walker
et al., 2001). nicotine has been reported to regulate osteoblast
proliferation and to induce expression of the  xxxg1222xxx  transcription factor
complex and the bone matrix protein osteopontin (walker et al., 2001).
nicotine has also been reported to inhibit the formation of osteoclasts
and to inhibit bone resorption in osteoblast/mononuclear cell cocultures
(yuhara et al., 1999). in addition to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the
existence and putative functions of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
in bone remain obscure, especially in human bone tissue. in this study,
we investigated the expression and functional activities of muscarinic

the suspension was gained after centrifuge. the cells were cultured
until conﬂuent and treated with rna extraction buffer (trizol™; 1 ml/
10 cm dish). the cell extraction was collected, vortexed and kept in ice
for 10 min. the following steps were similar to those mentioned
previously.

2.1. material
human osteosarcoma hos cells were purchase from bioresource
collection and research center (hsinchu, taiwan). human bone
specimens were obtained from taipei veterans general hospital and
listed in table 2. specimens were collected from ten patients with
bone injuries or scoliosis that all have patient's agreements under irb
approval (taipei veterans general hospital-institutional review
board no. 97-06-24a). mice and rats were obtained from animals
center of national taiwan university hospital. carbachol, epibatidine,
 xxxd2586xxx , thapsigargin, hepes, nahco3, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (mtt), digitonin, egta and
 xxxd3215xxx  (sds) were obtained from sigma-aldrich co.
(st. louis, mo, usa). fura-2/am was obtained from molecular probe
(eugene, or, usa). collagenase type i was obtained from worthington biochemical co. (lakewood, nj, usa). ham's f12 medium,
dulbecco's modiﬁed eagle's medium, alpha-mem, minimum essential
medium, penicillin–streptomycin were obtained from gibco brl
(gaithersburg, md, usa).
2.2. cell culture
hos (human osteosacroma, bcrc cat. 60308) were cultured in 90%
minimum essential medium eagle with 2 mm l-glutamine and earle's
bss adjusted to contain 1.5 g/l sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate and 10% fetal
bovine serum at 37 °c in a humidiﬁed air with 5% co2 (mcallister et al.,
1971).
2.3. isolation and culture of primary calvaria osteoblasts
icr mice (3-day old) were obtained from animals center of
national taiwan university hospital. for the preparation of osteoblast-like cells, mouse calvaria bone and mouse femur were used for
the isolation of osteoblasts by using collagenase type i digestion. cells
were maintained in alpha-mem containing 1.5 g/l sodium bicarbonate,
1% penicillin–streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum cultured at
37 °c in a humidiﬁed air with 5% co2 (horwood et al., 1998). our
animal study was approved by the institutional animal care and use
committee at soochow university.
2.4. rna extraction
rna extraction was carried based on a method modiﬁed from
chen et al. (2005). for human bone samples, vgh-irb (taipei
veterans general hospital—institutional review board no. 97-0624a) approved volunteer's bone specimen were collected during
surgery excision and cut immediately to a thickness of 5–10 mm and
frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. the samples were homogenized using a hand-held homogenized in ice-cold rna extraction
buffer (trizol™; 2 ml/g). tissue samples were collected and put on ice
for 10 min. 1-bromo-3-chloropropane (10%) was added to each
sample and mixed homogeneously at 4 °c for 10 min, then at 4 °c
centrifugation (12,000 rpm, sorvall legend mach 1.6r) for 10 min.
the suspension (0.5 ml) and 0.5 ml isoproylpanol kept at −80 °c for
2 h and then at 4 °c centrifugation (15,777 g) for 30 min. the
precipitate was washed with ice cold 75% ethanol twice and the
precipitate was suspended in depc water. the rna concentration was
detected by a dna/rna calculator. before cdna synthesis, the
samples were treated with dnase at 37 °c for 30 min, and then
stopped with the dnase inactivation reagent at 25 °c for 2 min and

2.5. cdna synthesis
a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) of the
total rna sample was completed using a standard protocol with
random primers (3 mug/mul), 10 mum of each dntp in depc water kept at
65 °c for 5 min. cdna synthesis started at the addition of superscript
iii reverse transcriptase (200 u/mul), ribonuclease inhibitor (ribolock™, 40 u/mul) and 0.1 m dtt in ﬁrst-strand buffer (50 mm tris–hcl,
ph 8.3; 75 mm kcl; 3 mm mgcl2, invitrogen) at 25 °c for 5 min, then
activated under 50 °c for 60 min. the reaction was inactivated by
heating at 70 °c for 15 min. negative controls consisting of reaction
mixtures without rna were also processed in parallel with the
experimental samples.

2.6. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
resulting cdna was used for subsequent polymerase chain reactions
using primers (0.5 mum) for the ﬁve muscarinic receptor subtypes, and
the  xxxg53xxx ,  xxxg861xxx  gene. type-speciﬁc primers were designed based on
published nucleotide sequences for the ﬁve human muscarinic receptor
genes listed in table 1. reactions were carried out in a thermal cycler
(astec, pc818) using 5 u/mul taq dna polymerase 1.5 mm mgcl2, pcr
buffer (500 mm kcl; 200 mm tris–hcl, ph 8.4), sterile depc water and
each dntp (0.2 mm) in a total volume of 50 mul. negative controls were
included in the pcr reaction in which the reverse transcription step was
omitted to assay for the presence of cdna from the initial extraction
step. the supplementary table 1 lists a pcr primer set for human,
mouse, rat, and bovine muscarinic receptors, osteocalcin,  xxxg2299xxx , receptor activator for nuclear factor kappab ligand, glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase, human neuroﬁlament-high, neuroﬁlamentmedium, and neuroﬁlament-low, acetylcholinesterase and  xxxg53xxx 
(genever et al., 1999; huang et al., 2000 ; janossy et al., 1999 ; mori et
al., 2007; nagai et al., 2007; wackym et al., 1996 ; wang et al., 2000 ;
zhao et al., 2005 ). pcr thermal cycler for supplementary table 1 was
run for denaturation at 94 °c for 3 min, and 25–35 cycles consisting of
denaturation at 94 °c for 45 s, annealing at 55–58 °c for 30–60 s, and
extension at 72 °c for 1 min; ﬁnal extension was at 72 °c for 10 min. all
pcr products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels,
stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed with ultraviolet
trans-illumination.

2.7. [ca2+]c measurement
cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were loaded with fura-2/am by incubation
with 10 mum fura-2/am at 37 °c for 40 min. cells were then washed
twice with loading buffer containing (in mm) nacl 150, kcl 5, glucose
5, mgcl2 1, cacl2 2.2, and hepes 10, ph 7.4. the ﬂuorescent
measurements were performed using a dual-excitation ﬂuorometer
(spex, cm system) at 340 nm and 380 nm excitation and 505 nm
emission. cytosolic ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]c) was calculated
using a ﬂuorescence ratio at 340 nm excitation and at 380 nm
(grynkiewicz et al., 1985). rmax was achieved by adding 0.01%
digitonin to the cuvette at the end of experiments; excess egta was
subsequently added to obtain rmin. a kd of 224 nm ca2+ for fura-2
was used. we performed ﬁve individual experiments in each protocol
by using different cell batches and each experiment was carried out at
least in duplicate.

2.8. mtt assay
the mtt assay, an index of cell viability and cell growth, is based
on the ability of viable cells to reduce mtt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) from a yellow, water-soluble
dye to a dark blue, insoluble formazan product (zaslau et al., 2004).
cells in 96 well plates were treated with  xxxd2586xxx  or antagonist
or other reagents for 40 h. the mtt dye was added to each well for the
last 4 h of the experiment, which was stopped by the addition of
solubilizing reagent (promega, madison, wi, usa). following solubilization overnight, the optical density was determined at 570 nm
subtract 630 nm (reference) on a multiwell plate reader (biorad
model no. 3550, biorad, mississauga, ontario, canada). background
absorbance of medium in the absence of cells was subtracted. all
samples were assayed in triplicate, and the mean for each experiment
was calculated. five batches of cells were used in this experiment.
2.9. statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance,
and signiﬁcant differences were assessed by student's t test comparing
with control. a p value b 0.01 was regarded as statistically signiﬁcant.
3. results
carbachol, an acetylcholine analog, induced an increase in
cytosolic calcium concentration ([ca2+]c) in human osteosarcoma
hos cells (fig. 1). carbachol induced a transient [ca2+]c increase, from
67 nm ± 10 nm to 163 nm ± 6 nm (n = 5), followed by a decrease to a
sustained level of 75 nm ± 5 nm within 1 min. both nicotinic and
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors can be activated by carbachol.
epibatidine and  xxxd2586xxx  are speciﬁc agonists of nicotinic
receptor and muscarinic receptors, respectively.  xxxd2586xxx , but
not epibatidine, induced a transient increase in [ca2+]c that was

blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine in hos cells.
the increase in [ca2+]c can originate from intracellular ca2+ stores or
from an inﬂux of extracellular ca2+, therefore calcium-free buffer was
used to distinguish them. a transient increase in [ca2+]c occurred in
response to  xxxd2586xxx  in ca2+-free buffer with ca2+ depletion by
egta. these results indicated that muscarinic receptors possibly exist
in human osteosarcoma hos cells.
to conﬁrm the expression of muscarinic receptor in these cells, rtpcr was performed. mrnas for all the muscarinic receptor subtypes 1 to
5 were identiﬁed (fig. 2).  xxxg2299xxx  and osteocalcin, common
proteins in bone tissue were also identiﬁed in human osteosarcoma hos
cells. the existence of muscarinic receptor subtypes 1 to 5 were also
evidenced by immunoblotting (supplementary fig. 1).
to evaluate the expression of muscarinic receptors in vivo,
experiments were performed using rat femur bone, mouse femur and
calvarial bone, bovine bone, and cultured mouse primary osteoblast
cells. fig. 3 shows rt-pcr data for rat femur identiﬁed mrnas for all
muscarinic receptor subtypes 1 to 5, which are bone speciﬁc. in addition,
osteocalcin, a bone speciﬁc protein, was detected. in primary isolated
mouse femur, mrnas for muscarinic receptor subtypes 1 to 5 were
identiﬁed (fig. 3b). similar to mouse femur, muscarinic receptor
subtypes m1, m4, and m5 were identiﬁed in mouse calvarial bone as
well (data not shown).
in bovine bone, fig. 4 shows the expression of muscarinic receptor
mrna in bovine scapula bone. in addition, mrnas for muscarinic
receptor subtypes 2, 3, and 4 were detected in bovine blade bone,
whereas mrnas for subtypes 2 and 3 were detected in spongy bone.
mrna for muscarinic receptor subtypes 2 and 4 were identiﬁed in
periosteum. thus, rt-pcr results showed that different muscarinic
receptor subtypes were distributed in various parts of the animal
skeletal system.
to conﬁrm the expression of muscarinic receptor in human bone, we
collected bone samples during various surgical operations, as listed in
supplementary table 2. reverse transcription polymerase chain

fig. 2. gene expression of muscarinic receptor subtypes in human osteosarcoma hos cells. rt-pcr identiﬁed cdna (+) for muscarinic receptor subtypes: m1: muscarinic receptor
subtype 1 (275 bp), m2: muscarinic receptor subtype 2 (654 bp), m3: muscarinic receptor subtype 3 (560 bp), m4: muscarinic subtype 4 (202 bp), m5, muscarinic receptor subtype
5 (451 bp). the corresponding total rna was used to control for genomic contamination (−). the bone related proteins were identiﬁed:  xxxg2299xxx  (op, 441 bp) and
osteocalcin (oc, 220 bp). glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (g, 258 bp) was used as internal control. dna size markers (l, 100–1000 bp) are shown. similar results were
obtained with 3 batches of hos cells.

reaction experiments were carried out to detect muscarinic receptor
subtypes. fig. 5 shows rt-pcr data for human rib (from a 9-year-old),
showing mrna expression of muscarinic receptor subtypes m1, m2, m3,
m4, and m5. to detect potential contamination by neuronal tissue, the
expression of three neuronal markers, neuroﬁlament-light, neuroﬁlament-medium, and neuroﬁlament-heavy, was assessed. fig. 5b shows
that none of these markers was detected by rt-pcr. all the human
samples listed in table 2 show all the samples contained some
muscarinic receptor subtypes.
to assess the effect of muscarinic receptor activation, human
osteosarcoma hos cells were treated with various concentrations of
 xxxd2586xxx  (fig. 6) in cell culture medium. concentrations of 100 mum
and 300 mum signiﬁcantly enhanced cell proliferation. atropine, a
muscarinic receptor antagonist, inhibited  xxxd2586xxx -induced cell
proliferation. serum can stimulate cell growth through its containing
growth factors, thus, the effects of agonists in the presence or absence of
serum were compared. fig. 7a shows serum (10%) caused signiﬁcant

cell growth. agonists including  xxxd2586xxx  (for muscarinic receptor),
carbachol (for acetylcholine receptor) and atp (for purinoceptor)
induced signiﬁcant cell growth in the absence of serum. additionally,
 xxxd1169xxx , speciﬁc inhibitor of the activation of mitogen-activated
protein kinase, suppressed the  xxxd2586xxx -induced cell proliferation
in the absence of serum (fig. 7b).
4. discussion
it is well known that the nervous system can regulate bone
remodeling via the hypothalamus and activation of the endocrine–
neuronal system. in addition to this systemic regulation, some neuronal
receptors, including nicotinic receptors (romano et al., 1997; walker
et al., 2001), purinoceptors (buckley et al., 2003; gallagher, 2004; katz
et al., 2006; 2008; orriss et al., 2007; panupinthu et al., 2008), and
adrenergic receptors (huang et al., 2009; togari, 2002; togari et al.,
1997), have been characterized in human bone. the expression of

neuronal receptors by osteoblasts and other bone-related tissues
suggests that neuronal signaling may play important roles on bone.
results of the present study demonstrated the expression of muscarinic
receptor subtypes in bone, providing additional evidence for cholinergic
signaling in bone.
in 2009, en-nosse et al. ﬁrstly reported the existence of muscarinic
receptor mrna including m2, m3, m4, m5 in human osteosarcoma
cell line saos-2 (en-nosse et al., 2009). in sato et al., 2010 reported
the existence of muscarinic receptor mrna including m1, m2, m4 in
murine primary osteoblasts and mouse pre-osteoblastic cell line
mc3t3-e1 (sato et al., 2010). in this study, all ﬁve subtypes of
muscarinic receptor were found in human osteosarcoma hos cells.
moreover, the existence of muscarinic receptor mrna was evidenced
in the primary tissue from rat, mouse, bovine and human. this study
shows not only sarcoma cell line but also mammalian primary tissue
and cells contain muscarinic receptors.

molecular cloning studies have identiﬁed 5 distinct muscarinic
receptor genes, m1 through m5, which have been shown to be widely
expressed in neuronal and nonneuronal tissues (caulﬁeld, 1993;
dorje et al., 1991). activation of muscarinic receptors mediates a
variety of cellular responses via guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. calcium signaling is coupled to m1, m3, and m5
activation via phospholipase c (caulﬁeld, 1993). the m2 and m4
subtypes also have small effects on calcium signaling (allen and
brown, 1993). results of the present study showed functional
coupling of muscarinic receptor activation with increased cytosolic
calcium concentrations in human osteosarcoma hos cells. osteoblasts
secrete rankl and opg, which regulate bone remodeling. secretion is
known to be coupled with an elevation of cytosolic calcium
concentration that is further coupled with the activation of muscarinic
receptor. further studies are required to fully elucidate the roles of
calcium-signaling coupled with muscarinic receptors in bone.
many studies of various tissues have shown that cell proliferation
can be modulated by activation of muscarinic receptors (ashkenazi et
al., 1989; frucht et al., 1999; guizzetti et al., 1996; ma et al., 2000;
matthiesen et al., 2007; wang et al., 1997). in lung tissue, cell
proliferation stimulated by muscarinic receptors occurs via the mek-

acetylcholine is synthesized in nerve endings as well as in
nonneuronal tissues and may act in an autocrine or paracrine manner
(proskocil et al., 2004). bone remodeling and homeostasis are
modulated by endocrine, paracrine (proskocil et al., 2004), and
autocrine factors (goldring and goldring, 1996; mundy, 1995;
pumarino and pumarino, 1996). acetylcholinesterase, vesicular acetylcholine transporter,  xxxg440xxx , and choline transporter
mrnas were detected in murine osteoblasts.(sato et al., 2010).
therefore, acetylcholine might act in an autocrine manner on
muscarinic receptors to enhance cell proliferation in bone. recent
reports have indicated roles of muscarinic receptors in cancer (schuller,
2008; song and spindel, 2008). the potential roles of muscarinic
receptors in bone cancer are an important issue that requires further
studies.
serum will alter the enhancement of  xxxd2586xxx  on cell
proliferation shown in fig. 7. in the absence of serum, the enhancement
of  xxxd2586xxx  on cell proliferation was more signiﬁcant. serum (10%)
will partially or totally counteract the proliferation enhancement
induced by  xxxd2586xxx , carbachol and atp. serum can activate
growth factor receptors to initiate cell proliferation via the mek-erk/
mapk cascade. the enhancement proliferation of  xxxd2586xxx  might
be through a similar pathway so that the  xxxd2586xxx -induced
enhancement could not be detected in the presence of serum. fig. 7b
shows that  xxxd1169xxx , an inhibitor of mapk, suppressed the  xxxd2586xxx -induced proliferation in hos cells. we suggest that cell proliferation
induced by the activation of muscarinic receptors can be via mek-erk/
mapk cascade. our suggestion can be supported by matthiesen's study
which found similar results in lung cells (matthiesen et al., 2007).
in conclusion, results of the present study demonstrate the
expression of muscarinic receptor subtypes in osteoblasts and animal
and human bone tissues. functional activity, in terms of  xxxd2586xxx -induced increases in intracellular calcium and enhanced cell
proliferation, were identiﬁed, which were inhibited by the muscarinic
receptor antagonist, atropine. this ﬁnding in muscarinic receptor
generates a new possible pathway related to bone remodeling.

fig. 7. effects of serum and  xxxd1169xxx  on agonist-induced cell proliferation in human
osteosarcoma hos cells. panel a. the cells were cultured for 40 h with various agonists,
named 0.1 mm  xxxd2586xxx , 0.1 mm carbachol and 0.1 mm atp in the absence
(containing 0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx ) or presence of fetal calf serum (10%). panel b.
the cells were cultured with  xxxd1169xxx , at 20 mum, in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm
 xxxd2586xxx . results shown are the mean of 3 experiments with different batches of hos
cells. results for control cells (100%) are without neurotransmitter treatment. panel b.
#signiﬁcant difference between 0% and 10% serum (# p b 0.05; ## p b 0.01). *signiﬁcant
difference between with and without agonist treatments (* p b 0.05; ** p b 0.01).

erk mapk cascade (matthiesen et al., 2007), and lung cancers
synthesize and secrete ach, which acts as an autocrine growth factor
to stimulate proliferation via muscarinic receptors (schuller, 2008;
song and spindel, 2008). in colon cancer cells, stimulation of the m3
muscarinic receptor subtype mediates cell proliferation (frucht et al.,
1999). sato et al. reported the proliferation enhancement by1mum
muscarine (agonist of muscarinic receptor) in murine osteoblast cells
(sato et al., 2010). in human osteosarcoma hos cells,  xxxd2586xxx 
enhanced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner with its
maximal effects at 0.1 mm in this study. high concentration of
 xxxd2586xxx  might induce receptor desensitization so the dose–
response creates a bell-curve. atropine inhibited the signiﬁcant
enhancement in cell proliferation induced by  xxxd2586xxx . we
suggest the enhancement on cell proliferation can be triggered under
the stimulation of muscarinic receptor.
