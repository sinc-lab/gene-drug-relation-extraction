abstract

the aim of this work was to investigate the ocular hypotensive activity of some topically administered camp-phosphodiesterase inhibitors alone and in combination with dopaminergic compounds. experiments were performed with ocular
normotensive rabbits and during transitory induced ocular hyper- or hypotension. an ocular hypotensive effect was observed
after instillation of  xxxd150xxx ,  xxxd1958xxx ,  xxxd2880xxx , caffeine, and iso-caffeine, but not following topical hydroxypropyl1,3- xxxd3344xxx . dopaminergic compounds were also studied in order to be combined with phosphodiesterase inhibitors as
ocular anti-hypertensive treatment. significant ocular hypotensive activity was observed after topical application of trifluperidol,
fluphenazine,  xxxd3359xxx , and the s ( - ) enantiomer of 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-n-n-propylpiperidine (3-ppp). of the camp-phosphodiesterase inhibitors that were tested,  xxxd2880xxx  was the most interesting compound, with good ocular tolerance,
significant reduction in intra-ocular pressure, and potential retinal microvascular benefits. after allowing adequate time for
 xxxd2880xxx  to reach its maximal activity, trifluperidol or s(-)-3-ppp was also instilled. a more pronounced ocular hypotensive
effect was then observed. the findings of this study may suggest that administration of eye-drops combining drugs acting by
separate ways on second messengers involved in the regulation of intra-ocular pressure (e.g.  xxxd1773xxx ) could be used to reduce
intra-ocular pressure during glaucoma.

1. introduction

the involvement of dopamine receptors in the regulation of intra-ocular pressure is now well established,
and the use of drugs acting on such receptors to reduce
intra-ocular pressure was suggested for the treatment
of glaucoma. in a previous work (hariton, 1992), we
reported that the s ( - ) enantiomer of 3-ppp (3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-n-n-propylpiperidine), a propylpiperidine
derivative acting as a partial agonist on dopamine
autoreceptors, had significant ocular hypotensive activity. no such effect was recorded after instillation of the
r ( + ) enantiomer, a direct agonist that stimulates both
pre- and post-synaptic dopamine receptors, as well as
sigma opiate receptors (massamiri and duckies, 1990).

ocular hypotension was also observed following the
instillation of  xxxd3359xxx , a non-selective dopamine
antagonist. this effect was explained by its more pronounced antagonistic action on dopamine d 1 post-synaptic receptors.
some authors have also proposed that adenylate
cyclase in the ciliary body could be a final common
pathway for adrenoceptor and dopamine d i receptor
activation in the regulation of intra-ocular pressure
(caprioli and sears, 1984; yorio, 1985) and that cyclic
 xxxd81xxx  (camp) could be one of the
secondary messengers involved in this regulation. in
this respect, an increase in camp levels has been
shown to reduce intra-ocular pressure (neufeld et al.,
1972) and to increase the outflow of aqueous humor in
both rabbits (neufeld et al., 1975) and monkeys (neufeld and sears, 1975). this explains our interest in
compounds that increase intra-ocular camp, and par-

ticularly of drugs that inhibit camp-phosphodicsterase, which is responsible for the conversion of camp
to  xxxd81xxx .
the aim of this work was to demonstrate the ocular
hypotensive activity of some camp-phosphodiesterase
inhibitors when topically administered, and any possible synergistic effect with dopaminergic compounds.

2. materials and methods

2.1. animals
these experiments were performed with new
zealand (nzr) albino male rabbits (cegav, france)
weighing 3.4 + 0.3 kg (mean + s.d.), and with fauve
de bourgogne (fbr) pigmented male rabbits (cegav,
france) weighing 3.3 + 0.4 kg (mean + s.d.). the animals were kept in individual cages in well-defined and
standardized conditions (hygrometry and temperaturecontrolled room, 12-h light/dark cycle), with dry pellet
diet (entretien 112, uar, france) and tap water ad
libitum. they were used after 2 weeks' habituation to
being placed in restraining boxes. to avoid any interaction with local anaesthetic agents used during intra-ocular pressure measurement, the animals were accustomed to the procedures of applanation tonometry for
about 3 weeks, and only those animals that had a
stable and unstressed record were included in the
study. all the methods used in this study have been
previously validated (hariton et al., 1990).
2.2. drug preparation and administration
trifluperidol ( p-fluoro-4-[4'-hydroxy-4'-(3"-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]piperidinobutyrophenone) hydrochloride (rbi, natick, ma, usa),  xxxd150xxx  (theophyiline [ xxxd3344xxx ] ethylenediamine 2:1)
and  xxxd2880xxx  (1-(5-oxoexyl)- xxxd3343xxx )
(both from sigma, st. louis, mo, usa) were dissolved
in 10%  xxxd2982xxx  (peg) 1500. caffeine
( xxxd404xxx ),  xxxd1958xxx  (7-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-theophylline), hydroxypropyl-theophylline (hydroxypropyi-l,3- xxxd3344xxx ) (all from sigma, st.
louis, mo, usa), and s ( - ) enantiomer of 3-ppp
hydrochloride (3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-n-n-propylpiperidine) and iso-caffeine (1,3,9-trimethylxanthine) (both
from rbi, natick, ma, usa) were dissolved in distilled water.  xxxd3359xxx  (n,n-dimethyl-9-[3-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl) propylidene]thioxanthene-2-sulfonamide hydrochloride (rbi, natick, ma, usa) was
dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) 150 mm.
fluphenazine (4-[3-[2-(trifluoromethyl)- 10 h-phenothiazin- 10-yl]propyl]- 1-piperazineethanol) dihydrochloride
(rbi, natick, ma, usa) was dissolved in phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) 50 mm buffer. with a hamilton

syringe, a single dose of 100 /zl was administered to
each eye, followed by a palpebral occlusion for 30 s.
2.3. intra-ocular pressure measurements
experiments were done with ocular normotensive
rabbits and during transitory ocular hypertension induced by water-loading or intravenous injection of 5%
glucose solution, or during transitory ocular hypotension induced by intravenous infusion of 20% naci
solution. intra-ocular pressure was measured from the
corneal surface, without any anaesthesia, using a calibrated electronic applanation tonometer (pneumatonograph, alcon labs, forth worth, tx, usa) with
recorder (neault et al., 1989). for these measurements,
the animals were placed in a quiet room, with the same
bright light conditions as the animal house. pupil diameters were also recorded in ocular normotensive rabbits, using a thomas' pupillometer (luneau ophthalmologie, france).
2.4. ocular hypertension induced by water-loading
oral water-loading was done in animals deprived of
food for 24 h before each experiment. water (50 ml/kg)
was rapidly administered at room temperature via an
orogastric catheter (tygon r3603, id 5/32, od 7/32,
norton, usa), using an automatic dispenser, immediately after the baseline measurement of intra-ocular
pressure. the test compounds were instilled 15 min
after water-loading because, at this time-point (tm~x),
the maximal intra-ocular pressure increase was
recorded in the control group. comparisons were made
with results observed after vehicle instillation immediately prior to water-loading (control group).
2.5. ocular hypertension induced by 5% glucose injection
immediately after baseline intra-ocular pressure was
recorded, 20 ml/kg of a sterile 5% glucose solution
(aguettant labs., lyon, france) was rapidly injected in
the marginal vein of the ear through a 23-gauge needie. five minutes after this injection (which corresponds to tma~ in the control group), the tested compounds were instilled. comparisons were made with
the results observed after instillation of vehicle, immediately prior to the glucose injection (control groups).
2.6. ocular hypotension induced by 20% naci infusion
immediately after baseline intra-ocular pressure was
recorded, 4 ml/kg of a sterile hypertonic saline (20%
naci, aguettant labs., lyon, france) was infused into
the marginal vein of the ear at a rate of 1 ml/min,
using an automatic syringe (razei scientific instruments, stamford, ct, usa) with a catheter loop sub-

c. hariton / european journal of pharmacology 258 (1994) 85-94

merged in a bath maintained at 37°c. ten minutes
after the end of the 20%  xxxg2020xxx  infusion (which corresponds to tmax in the control group), the test compounds were instilled. comparisons were made with
the results observed after instillation of vehicle, immediately after the end of 20% naci infusion (control
groups).
in this model, any ocular hypotensive activity of a
given test drug can be seen as (i) a greater decrease in
intra-ocular pressure as compared to that of the control group at tmax (time of maximal decrease), (ii) a
delay in restoration of baseline intra-ocular pressure,
and (iii) a decrease in the slopc of the intra-ocular
pressure recovery curve, i.e. the second part of the
intra-ocular pressure kinetic profile (chiou and li,
1992).

2. 7. data presentation and statistical analysis
intra-ocular pressure kinetic profiles represent the
mean + s.e.m. of changes from pre-drug values (observed at t_ 10rain and t0min). changes in intra-ocular
pressure were studied until baseline values were restored. areas under or above the curves (aucs)
recorded until the intra-ocular pressure recovered were
determined by using the trapezoidal rule method (tallarida and murray, 1987). first-order linear regression
p a r a m e t e r s were determined with the least-squares
method (tallarida and murray, 1987). intra-ocular
pressure changes and a u c s were compared to the
values recorded after vehicle instillation by using
kruskal-wallis' test for p = 0.05 ( t h e o d o r s o n norheim, 1986). slope values were compared by using
the appropriate student's t-test (tallarida and murray,
1987).

3.1. effects of dopaminergic compounds
in ocular normotensive rabbits, intra-ocular pressure kinetic profiles recorded after instillation of 0.5%
 xxxd3359xxx , 0.5% trifluperidol, 1% fluphenazine and
2.5% s( - )-3-ppp are shown in fig. 1. the most marked
decrease in intra-ocular pressure was observed after
2.5% s ( - )-3-ppp, with a maximal decrease of 5.0 mm
hg from 30 min to 50 min post-instillation. the recovery time of initial intra-ocular pressure was about 2 h.
 xxxd3359xxx  induced a longer ocular hypotensive effect
after 0.5% instillation, with a recovery time longer than
3 h and a maximal decrease of 4.5 mm hg occurring 70
min post-instillation. this longer activity was also observed with 1.0% fluphenazine, which induced a maximal decrease of 4.1 mm hg occuring 2 h after instillation. a less pronounced hypotensive effect was seen
after 0.5% trifluperidol instillation, with a maximal
decrease of 3.0 mm hg and a recovery time of 90 min.
trifluperidol, s( - )-3-ppp and  xxxd3359xxx  were also
studied in the transitory ocular hypotension model, and
a significant intra-ocular pressure decrease was
recorded (fig. 2). aucs of kinetic profiles after trifluperidol or s ( - ) - 3 - p p p instillation increased by 63%
and 69%, respectively ( p < 0.001), as compared to those
for animals given pbs 150 mm.  xxxd3359xxx  had a
more potent activity in this model. after 0.5% solution
instillation, we recorded an average intra-ocular pressure decrease of 11.8 m m hg, i.e. - 3 . 3 mm hg as
compared to that of the control group (fall in intra-ocular pressure for control group: - 8.5 mm hg), with an
a u c value of 1410 mm h g . min. the recovery time of
initial intra-ocular pressure was 4 h, i.e. an increase of

2 h as compared to that of the control group. the
intra-ocular pressures at all times (except for the recovery time) were significantly different from those of
control animals ( p < 0.01), and the kinetic profile a u c
increased by 152% ( p < 0.001) compared to that of
animals given pbs 150 mm.
no significant changes in pupil diameters were observed after administration of these compounds. ocular tolerance for 0.5% trifluperidol (ph 4.2, 180
m o s m / l ) and 2.5% 3-ppp (ph 7.0, 190 m o s m / 1 ) was
good, while slight conjunctival redness was noted immediately after 0.5%  xxxd3359xxx  (ph 5.7, 310 m o s m / l )
or 1% fluphenazine (ph 5, 330 m o s m / l ) instillation.
since ocular hypotensive activity is known to be
different with respect to eye pigmentation, the effects
of s ( - )-3-ppp,  xxxd3359xxx  and fluphenazine were also
studied in ocular normotensive and transitory hypotensive pigmented fauve de bourgogne rabbits. the results are reported in figs. 3 and 4, and are compared
to the kinetic profiles of intra-ocular pressure recorded
in albino new zealand rabbits. these compounds had
a long-lasting effect in pigmented animals.

during the short-lasting ocular hypertension induced by i.v. glucose injection, 2.5% s(-)-3-ppp instilled 30 min before the injection significantly reduced
the intra-ocular pressure increase recorded in the control group, with an increase of 3.7 mm hg at tmax (i.e.

significant changes were noted in the control group.
comparison of mean aucs for  xxxd2880xxx  (244 mm

highly significant increase (+ 88%, p < 0.001) in ocular

during transitory ocular hypotension, 0.5% trifluperidol instilled 30 min before the beginning of naci
infusion significantly limited the decrease in intra-ocular pressure.  xxxd2880xxx  given 1.5 h prior to the

activity (fig. 8). statistical comparisons for maximal

during the short-lasting ocular hypertension induced by i.v. glucose injection, 0.5% trifluperidol instilled 30 min before the glucose injection significantly
reduced the intra-ocular pressure increase recorded in
the control group, with an increase of 4.9 mm hg at
tm~x (i.e. 5 min after the glucose injection) instead of
9.5 mm hg after vehicle (distilled water) instillation
(fig. 9). this hypotensive activity was also evidenced by
the decrease in kinetic profile aucs ( - 8 2 % , p <

interest in dopaminergic compounds as possible future replacements for adrenergic-related substances in
the treatment of glaucoma was raised a few years ago
(mclaughlin and chiou, 1985; karnezis and murphy,
1988). we reported recently the hypotensive activity of
s(-)-3-ppp and  xxxd3359xxx  when topically administered in ocular normotensive rabbits (hariton, 1992).
both drugs act, but in a different way, on the dopaminergic neurotransmission. in this paper, we present results obtained by using different models in pigmented
and non-pigmented rabbits. moreover, we report the
ocular hypotensive activity of topical trifluperidol and
fluphenazine, both acting as non-selective dopamine
receptor antagonists.
s(-)-3-ppp (preclamol) is a presynaptically selective agonist at dopamine d 2 receptor sites (hjorth et
al., 1981) with some antagonist activities at postsynaptic dopamine receptors (george et al., 1985).
bromocriptine, which is also a relatively selective
dopamine d 2 receptor agonist, was previously reported
to induce a significant decrease in intra-ocular pressure
in ocular normotensive subjects after oral administration (mekki and turner, 1985) and topical administration (elibol et al., 1992), and after oral treatment of
glaucoma patients (geyer et al., 1987). such an effect
was also observed in ocular normotensive humans
treated orally with pergolide (ai-sereiti et al., 1989,
1990).
 xxxd3359xxx  (skf-5019) is a non-selective dopamine
receptor antagonist (hyttel, 1978). ocular hypotensive
activities were already reported for these drugs, which
block non-selectively the pre- and post-synaptic effects
of dopamine. this was clearly demonstrated for
haloperidol (sheppard and schaid, 1986), lenperone,
moperone, trifluperidol, and fluoropipamide (chiou et
al., 1989). this effect could be explained by a more
pronounced antagonistic action at dopamine d 1 receptor sites at the tested doses, as previously reported for
lenperone (chiou, 1984).
camp acting as a second messenger is intimately
involved in both dopaminergic and adrenergic neurotransmission. the location and the function of
dopamine receptors in the ocular structures involved in
the regulation of intra-ocular pressure (e.g. ciliary processes, or trabecular meshwork), as well as their links
with camp, are still a controversial issue (wax, 1993).
in the retina, it was demonstrated that dopamine d~
receptors are positively coupled to adenylate cyclase,
while dopamine d 2 receptors could be negatively cou-

91

pied or not coupled to adenylate cyclase (hadjiconstantinou et al., 1991).
more recently, potter et al. (1993) reported that
ha-ll7, an octahydrobenzo[f]quinoline, induces a decrease in intra-ocular pressure in ocular normotensive
rabbits and suppresses ocular hypertension in waterloaded animals. they demonstrated that this effect was
mediated by an action at prejunctional dopamine d 2
receptors which did not involve prejunctional suppression of camp accumulation.
in 1972, neufeld et al. demonstrated the direct
involvement of camp in the regulation of intra-ocular
pressure. they showed a positive correlation between
the hypotensive effects of some adrenergic agonists
and the increase in camp levels in aqueous humor,
and also noted that these changes were dose dependent. moreover, they recorded a decrease in intra-ocular pressure after the injection of camp into the
anterior chamber of the eye, while the injection of the
inactive product  xxxd81xxx  was ineffective.
an important step in the transduction system involved in adrenergic or dopaminergic neurotransmission is the mechanism of ribosylation of the adenylate
cyclase complex, leading to the production of camp.
this intracellular messenger, by activating a phosphorylation system of transduction, may directly regulate
membrane permeability which, in turn, controls the
rate of formation of aqueous humor by decreasing net
trans-epithelial fluid movement in the ciliary body
(sears et al., 1984).
by incubating intact ciliary processes with cholera
toxin, a potent irreversible stimulator of adenylate cyclase, caprioli and sears (1984) demonstrated the involvement of this enzyme complex in the regulation of
intra-ocular pressure, and reported a significant increase in intracellular camp levels, even with a cholera
toxin concentration as low as 1 nm. moreover, intravitreal injection of 15 ng of cholera toxin into rabbit eyes
significantly lowered intra-ocular pressure. similar results were obtained with  xxxd1742xxx , which acts as a
direct, potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase in rabbit
and human ciliary processes, and induces dose-dependent ocular hypotension in rabbits, monkeys and humans (caprioli and sears, 1983; caprioli et al., 1984).
 xxxd1773xxx  levels can be increased by inhibiting
camp-phosphodiesterase, the enzyme responsible for
the conversion of camp to  xxxd81xxx . it has been reported that the intravenous injection of the most used
phosphodiesterase inhibitors, i.e. the methylxanthine
derivatives caffeine, theobromine, and  xxxd150xxx ,
does not induce ocular hypotension (neufeld et al.,
1972), and often leads to ocular hypertension with
increased doses.
in this study, we tested some methylxanthine derivatives known to be inhibitors of camp-phosphodiesterase, in order to assess their ability to reduce

92

c. hariton / european journal of pharmacology 258 (1994) 85-94

intra-ocular pressure after instillation in ocular normotensive rabbits. we were not able to observe any
change in intra-ocular pressure after the instillation of
hydroxypropyl-l,3- xxxd3344xxx , a soluble derivative of theophylline. a moderate decrease in intra-ocular pressure was observed after instillation of aminophyiline, the ethylenediamine derivative of theophylline. a more marked decrease in intra-ocular pressure was observed after instillation of  xxxd1958xxx , a
dihydroxypropyl derivative of theophylline, and iso-caffeine, the latter showing a delayed activity peaking 4 h
after administration.
 xxxd2880xxx , an oxohexylxanthine derivative, induces a decrease quite similar to that recorded after
 xxxd1958xxx  administration. an important dose-dependent ocular hypotensive effect was observed after topical
administration of caffeine, the well-known  xxxd404xxx . owing to its poor ocular tolerance we
did not use this compound in the combination studies.
in spite of differences in molecular weight, it is
quite surprising to note that our search for the best
dose-effect ratio (data not shown) led us to use the
same concentration (2%) of every tested phosphodiesterase inhibitor, except for hydroxypropyl-l,3-dimcthylxanthine, which did not affect intra-ocular pressure, even at a dose up to 5%.
it has been reported by yamazaki et al. (1990) that
instillation of the pivaloyloxymethyi ester of griseolic
acid, a potent inhibitor of camp-phosphodiesterase,
induces in the rabbit a dose-dependent decrease in
intra-ocular pressure, with a maximal activity between
2 and 3 h after administration. this corresponds well
with results for caffeine,  xxxd150xxx  and pentoxifyiline. intra-vitreal injection of griseolic acid or its
pivaloyloxymethyl ester derivative elicits a large decrease in intra-ocular pressure, with a maximal effect 2
days after injection, and an activity lasting about 6
days. accumulation of camp in rabbit iris-ciliary body
was also observed after incubation with these compounds (mishima et al., 1991). it was thought that
these compounds lower the intra-ocular pressure by
decreasing the inflow of aqueous humor (kiuchi et al.,
1991). kiuchi (1990) also observed that griseolic acid
ester markedly enhances the hypotensive effect of  xxxd2401xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx .
the use of camp-phosphodiesterase inhibitors to
reduce intra-ocular pressure or to increase the fall in
intra-ocular pressure induced by adrenergic agents was
also stressed by busch and hoyng (1991), busch et al.
(1991) and hoyng et al. (1991). they reported that a
suspension of  xxxd2388xxx , its ethylenediamine salt, or  xxxd2388xxx  bound to cyclodextrin, instilled in rabbits or dogs, enhanced the
effects of adrenoceptor agents such as epinephrine,
norepinephrine, and  xxxd2401xxx , lsobutylmethylxanthine alone had no effect on intra-ocular pressure, but

it enhanced in a dose-dependent manner the ocular
hypotensive effects of the adrenergic drugs tested. this
synergistic effect coincided with a marked elevation of
camp level in the aqueous humor (hoyng et al., 1991).
more recently, busch et al. (1992) demonstrated a
long-lasting decrease in intra-ocular pressure after a
subconjunctival injection of 8-bromo-camp or 8bromo-cyclic guanyl monophosphate (8-bromo-cgmp).
in addition, they observed that the kinetics of the
ocular hypotensive activity of 8-bromo-camp depended on its concentration in the aqueous humor.
methylxanthine derivatives are also competitive inhibitors at adenosine receptor sites, and it has been
demonstrated that some adenosine receptor agonists
have ocular hypotensive activity in rabbits. more recently, crosson (1992) reported a time-dependent
biphasic effect on intra-ocular pressure of r ( - ) - p h e n ylisopropyl-adenosine, a relatively selective agonist at
adenosine a i receptors, in the rabbit. the effects of
methylxanthine derivatives described in this paper
could therefore be partly attributed to their action at
adenosine receptor sites. nevertheless, caffeine is a
relatively weak and non-selective adenosine receptor
antagonist, showing an apparent k i value at adenosine
ai or a 2 sites in the micromolar range, and  xxxd2880xxx  has no antagonist activity at adenosine receptor
sites (daly et al., 1991). besides, these agents do not
induce a time-dependent biphasic effect but a dose-dependent decrease in intra-ocular pressure. thus, the
ocular hypotensive effect we observed does not seem to
be mediated by a direct action on adenosine receptor
sites.
it has been suggested that caffeine, theophylline and
isobutyl-l-methylxanthine, and probably other campphosphodiesterase inhibitors, have an inhibitory effect
on cgmp-phosphodiesterase (helfman and kuo, 1982).
this enzyme is found in the ciliary body, and its
inhibition leads to an increase in cgmp levels; cgmp
is another second messenger involved in the regulation
of intra-ocular pressure (nathanson, 1987). thus, an
additional action of the methylxanthine derivatives we
studied on cgmp-phosphodiesterase should be considered.
morcover, two dopaminergic compounds had a more
pronounced ocular hypotensive effect when combined
with pcntoxifylline. after single instillation in ocular
normotensivc animals, and in three different transitory
ocular hypotension and hypertension models,  xxxd2880xxx  instilled with s( - )-3-ppp or trifluperidol caused
marked and long-lasting ocular hypotension.  xxxd2880xxx  is currently used as an orally active haemorheological agent in the therapy of vascular disease (for
review, see ward and clissold, 1987). treatment with
oral  xxxd2880xxx  in humans resulted in a significant
improvement in retinal capillary blood flow velocity
(sonkin ct al., 1993), while gradual enlargement of
