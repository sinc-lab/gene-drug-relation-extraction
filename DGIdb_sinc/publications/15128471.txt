aldosterone mediates both water and electrolyte balance by
acting on the renal mineralocorticoid receptors. recent
experimental studies have also documented the presence of
these receptors in other body organs, including the brain,
blood vessels, and heart, suggesting that aldosterone plays a
larger role in normal physiologic function and in cardiovascular diseases such as systemic hypertension and congestive
heart failure (chf). the nonspecific aldosterone inhibitor
spironolactone, and the selective aldosterone inhibitor
 xxxd2010xxx , are both approved for clinical use in treating
patients with hypertension and/or symptomatic chf. studies
have shown that spironolactone lowers blood pressure,
improves endothelial function, reduces myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, and lowers the incidence of fatal arrhythmias.
 xxxd2010xxx , which is more specific for the mineralocorticoid
receptor, appears to provide all the beneficial effects of
spironolactone in hypertensive patients, with the potential to
modify many of the side effects related to nonspecific steroidreceptor blockade. hyperkalemia remains a potential problem with all aldosterone antagonists.

introduction
aldosterone was discovered in the early 1950s by simpson
and tait [1]. it was found to have a powerful receptor-mediated effect on kidney epithelial cells to enhance sodium and
water reabsorption and potassium secretion. aldosterone is
the most potent naturally occurring corticosteroid with regard
to its actions on fluid and electrolyte balance.
during the past decade, new discoveries have changed
our understanding of aldosterone and its biologic actions.
the observation that aldosterone can produce rapid
responses that are not inhibited by receptor blockers has
challenged the concept that aldosterone works solely
through  xxxg1602xxx  (mr)-mediated
genomic effects [2,3]. it has also been shown that aldosterone can exert effects on nonepithelial cells [4,5•], such as
cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and

that these cells might also possess the synthetic capacity for
aldosterone production. of great interest is the growing
evidence that has linked aldosterone to direct myocardial
injury (table 1). in experimental studies, aldosterone has
been associated with endothelial dysfunction through
inhibition of  xxxd2738xxx  bioactivity [6–8]. it can cause
fibrosis in the heart and in blood vessels [9•,10•,11]. in
addition to producing cardiac fibrosis, a direct arrhythmogenic action of aldosterone has been proposed [12].
aldosterone has been shown to adversely affect fibrinolytic
balance [13,14].
several studies have linked aldosterone levels with the
development of left ventricular (lv) hypertrophy and adverse
myocardial remodeling [15,16•,17••,18,19•], independent
of blood-pressure (bp) level [5•,20,21•]. it has also been
shown that aldosterone itself can attenuate the baroreflex
control of heart rate and sympathetic discharge [22].
in this review, we explore the clinical evidence for the
use of  xxxg1602xxx  blockers, focusing on
 xxxd2010xxx , a selective receptor antagonist, in the management of systemic hypertension and how this evidence
relates to underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.

aldosterone physiology
the principle function of aldosterone is to help conserve
sodium and water and enhance the secretion of potassium
ions by the kidney. the major physiologic stimuli for aldosterone release are a deficiency of sodium and an excess of potassium. production of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex is
regulated, in part, by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) (fig. 1). other factors, such as potassium, endothelin, and various neurotransmitters are also known to
enhance aldosterone production [5•,23].
classic aldosterone effects are mediated by its binding
to a specific intracellular mr [24]. this receptor forms a
subfamily with the  xxxg1601xxx . the classic
effect of aldosterone on polarized epithelial tissue in the
kidney is to enhance sodium absorption mediated by apical amiloride-sensitive sodium ion channels and the basolateral na+/k+ adenosine triphosphatase (atpase) pump.
evidence has also been mounting to suggest that aldosterone has effects on nonepithelial tissues that are mediated through both mr-directed and mr-independent
mechanisms [4,5•]. in addition to the mr in the kidney,
the mr has also been identified in the brain, blood vessels,

and heart [25,26]. cardiac tissue also has been found to
have the enzymatic activity required for aldosterone production [26].

aldosterone in the pathophysiology
of hypertension
although the ability of aldosterone to produce hypertension is thought to be secondary to its classic renal actions,
it is now recognized that aldosterone is involved in several
nonrenal actions that could contribute to abnormal bp elevations. unlike  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii), which is a powerful
vasoconstrictor, aldosterone produces only weak acute vasoconstrictor effects [27]. however, when doses of aldosterone are infused into the brain, an increase in bp is seen
[28]. further support for this mechanism comes from studies by young et al. [29•] who showed that the injection of
an mr antagonist in the brain can prevent hypertension in
rats. these studies also demonstrated the dissociation
between bp and myocardial fibrosis, despite the ability of
central aldosterone antagonism to prevent bp elevation.
other experimental studies demonstrated that chronic
aldosterone infusion increased vascular reactivity to several
vasoconstrictor substances, including ang ii and catecholamines. in support of these observations is the finding that
aldosterone administration can increase ang ii receptor
density [30] while blocking the extraneural uptake of norepinephrine [31•]. the ability of aldosterone to potentiate
the vasoconstrictor action of norepinephrine is consistent
with the bp–raising actions of the mineralocorticoid that
are unrelated to its actions on the distal nephron [31•].
aldosterone has been found to decrease baroreceptor
sensitivity, which would support an abnormal bp elevation
[32]. aldosterone, through its ability to increase vascular
fibrosis [33], might also lead to a stiffening of conduit vessels, a mechanism contributing to systolic bp elevation.
there is experimental evidence that the local synthesis of

aldosterone in blood vessels might participate in the
hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells [4]. vascular
hypertrophy can also predispose to enhanced vasoconstrictor responses and hypertension.
regarding the end-organ complications of hypertension,
it has been shown that excess aldosterone is associated with
an increase in lv wall thickness and mass and a decrease in
lv filling index, compared with patients with essential hypertension and similar bp. studies have shown that a high level
of aldosterone is an independent predictor of lv hypertrophy, separate from bp elevation [4,34]. aldosterone has also
been implicated in the generation of fatal ventricular arrhythmias [17••], both directly and indirectly.

aldosterone-receptor antagonists
potassium-sparing diuretics can be divided into two distinct classes: competitive antagonists of aldosterone, such
as spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx , which are discussed
later, or those that do not interact with aldosterone receptors, such as amiloride and triamterene.
the  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors
and  xxxg99xxx  receptor blockers (arbs) cause
decreased stimulation of aldosterone release. however,
studies show that this aldosterone suppression does not
continue with chronic use of these medications (aldosterone synthesis escape) [23]. this phenomenon might
explain why aldosterone inhibitors have additional bp–
lowering effects and benefits in heart failure patients when
used in combination with ace inhibitors or arbs.
the  xxxg1602xxx  antagonists are effective bp–
lowering drugs, but there are a lack of morbidity and mortality data with these drugs in comparison with data for
thiazide diuretics. therefore, the seventh report of the
joint national committee on prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (jnc vii)
recommends thiazides as first-line diuretic agents over
aldosterone antagonists [35•].
spironolactone is a lipid-soluble  xxxg1602xxx 
antagonist (table 2) that also has an affinity for both androgenic and progestogenic receptors (nonspecific aldosterone
antagonist). the use of spironolactone in the treatment of
hypertension is well-established, and there is a long experience with the drug for treating patients with peripheral edema
and ascites [36]. spironolactone also has been used in combination with loop diuretics in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (chf) [36]. in addition to the known
diuretic properties of spironolactone, it was recently demonstrated that this drug blocks numerous, deleterious, tissuebased effects attributable to aldosterone, which includes an
augmentation of both vascular and myocardial fibrosis
[5•,9•,10•,11]. in the randomized  xxxd3238xxx  evaluation
study (rales), spironolactone was shown to reduce the risk
for all-cause mortality in new york heart association class ii
to iv patients treated with standard ace inhibitor and
diuretic therapy [17••]. it has been demonstrated that  xxxg572xxx -

against vascular injury by blocking not only
the production and effects of  xxxg99xxx  but
also by reducing aldosterone production.
however, loss of aldosterone suppression has
been known to occur, despite adequate  xxxg99xxx  inhibition; therefore, aldosterone
blockers have been shown to provide further
benefit in the protection against end-organ
damage. *—includes nonselective (spironolactone) and selective ( xxxd2010xxx ) aldosterone blockers. (adapted from stier et al. [5•].)

terone levels are elevated in patients despite ace inhibitor
therapy, which might explain the additive benefit of spironolactone in rales [17••]. serious hyperkalemia developed in
only 1% and 2% of the placebo- and spironolactone-treated
groups, respectively. however, the development of gynecomastia or breast pain in males was significantly higher in the
spironolactone-treated group. in addition to hypertension,
spironolactone is approved as an adjunct therapy for chf.
 xxxd2010xxx  ( xxxd2010xxx , pfizer, new york) is a new aldosterone antagonist that selectively binds to the mr. compared
with spironolactone, it has a lower affinity for the androgen
and progesterone receptors. the molecular structure of
 xxxd2010xxx  replaces the 17alpha-thioacetal group of spironolactone with a carbomethyl group, thereby conferring excellent
selectivity for the  xxxg1602xxx  over other steroid
receptors [5•]. with this structural substitution,  xxxd2010xxx 
appears to be associated with a lower risk for the development
of gynecomastia, breast tenderness, and menstrual irregularities when compared with spironolactone.
 xxxd2010xxx  has a trough-to-peak ratio that is higher
than 90%, making it a suitable agent for once-daily dosing.
the drug is metabolized in the liver via cyp3a4, and,
unlike spironolactone, no active metabolites of  xxxd2010xxx 
have been identified.
in placebo-controlled trials,  xxxd2010xxx  used alone or
in combination with other antihypertensive drugs was
shown to significantly reduce bp in patients with systemic
hypertension [5•]. in comparative studies,  xxxd2010xxx  was
shown to have a bp–lowering effect similar to that of ace
inhibitors [37], arbs [38], dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [39], and spironolactone [40•].
 xxxd2010xxx  has been studied in various subgroups of
hypertensive patients [4,41]. in patients with low plasmarenin activity,  xxxd2010xxx  was found to lower systolic and

diastolic bp significantly more than losartan at the end of
8 weeks of therapy [38]. this observation might be of particular relevance to the treatment of hypertension in the
black population, in whom bp elevation often occurs,
despite low levels of renin activity in the systemic circulation [42,43]. it is generally thought that, for this reason,
ace inhibitors and arbs are typically less effective in
lowering the pressure of black compared with white
hypertensives [44•,45]. flack et al. [44•] conducted the
first study to compare the effects of  xxxd2010xxx  in black
a n d w h i t e hy p e r t e n s i ve p a t i e n t s, o b s e r v i n g t h a t
 xxxd2010xxx  reduced bp significantly more than placebo,
with the drug showing similar efficacy in both blacks and
whites. however,  xxxd2010xxx  was superior to losartan for
the treatment of hypertension in blacks and showed a
trend toward greater efficacy than losartan in whites
[44•]. in a study conducted in diabetic hypertensive
patients with microalbuminuria, it was found that
 xxxd2010xxx  at 200 mg/d, enalapril 40 mg/d, or the combination of  xxxd2010xxx  200 mg/d and enalapril 10 mg/d
resulted in equivalent reductions in systolic and diastolic
bp at the end of 8 or 24 weeks of treatment [46]. however, microalbuminuria, as assessed by the urinary albumin -to-  xxxd1759xxx  ine r ati o, was reduced more so by
 xxxd2010xxx  than enalapril, and their combination was
more effective than treatment with either agent alone.
these results further confirm the antihypertensive efficacy
of  xxxg1602xxx  blockade, as well as a bp independent effect to reduce proteinuria, which is known to be a
surrogate marker for cardiovascular disease [47].
white et al. [39] compared  xxxd2010xxx  to amlodipine
in older patients with systolic hypertension and/or wide
pulse pressures. reduction in bp values were similar in
both treatment groups.

another study evaluated the efficacy and safety of
 xxxd2010xxx , enalapril, and  xxxd2010xxx  plus enalapril in
patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and lv
hypertrophy [48]. known as the 4e study, groups were randomized to receive  xxxd2010xxx  200 mg, enalapril 40 mg, or
a combination of  xxxd2010xxx  200 mg and enalapril 10 mg.
after 8 weeks, uncontrolled bp was normalized by using
hydrochlorothiazide as an add-on therapy, and primary
end points were evaluated after 9 months of treatment. the
mean changes from baseline in lv mass, as measured by
mri, for  xxxd2010xxx , enalapril, and  xxxd2010xxx  plus enalapril groups were -14.5 g, -19.7 g, and -27.2 g, respectively.
 xxxd2010xxx  was similar to enalapril in reducing lv mass (p
< 0.05), but the combination regimen produced a significantly greater reduction compared with  xxxd2010xxx  alone
(p = 0.007). a similar pattern of significant reductions in
systolic bp and the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio
were observed. these results confirm the efficacy of aldosterone antagonism in reducing lv mass and hypertension,
and suggest that combination therapy with an ace inhibitor might offer additional benefit.
an improvement in endothelial function has also been
demonstrated with  xxxd2010xxx  treatment in an experimental model of atherosclerosis [49•]. in this study,
 xxxd2010xxx  treatment in hyperlipidemic rabbits significantly improved endothelial-dependent relaxation
responses to acetylcholine, but did not affect the contractile response to phenylephrine or ang ii. moreoever,
 xxxd2010xxx  significantly reduced the increased production
of oxygen free radicals that was observed in these hypercholesterolemic rabbits (p < 0.01).  xxxd2010xxx  also
reduced vascular reduced form nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (nadh/nadph) oxidase activity. these results suggest that activation of the mr
increases o 2 -generating oxidases in the vasculature
through an nadh/nadph oxidase-dependent mechanism. thus, mr antagonism might improve endothelial
function during hypercholesterolemia and provide a new
approach for treating atherosclerosis [49•].  xxxd2010xxx 
was shown to improve coronary hemodynamics and to
reduce cardiac fibrosis in aging, spontaneously hypertensive rats [50]. in addition, it was recently shown in dogs

that  xxxd2010xxx  attenuated glomerular hyperfiltration,
sodium retention, and hypertension associated with
chronic dietary-induced obesity [51].
similar to spironolactone, there are no major morbidity or mortality studies with  xxxd2010xxx  in patients with
hypertension. the results of a recently completed placebocontrolled study in patients with lv dysfunction following
a myocardial infarction ( xxxd2010xxx  post-acute myocardial infarction heart failure efficacy and survival study
[ephesus]) [52••] demonstrated a significant reduction
in the combined end points of death from cardiovascular
causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, the rate
of death from any cause, and the rate of sudden death from
cardiac causes. compared with placebo, there was no significant difference in the rate of gynecomastia or impotence in men and breast tenderness in women. the rate of
serious hyperkalemia was 5.5% in the  xxxd2010xxx  group
and 3.9% in the placebo group.
 xxxd2010xxx  was approved by the us food and drug
administration (fda) for clinical use in hypertension in
2003. based on the ephesus study, the drug was also
approved to improve survival in patients with lv dysfunction, systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%), and clinical evidence of chf after an acute myocardial infarction.
 xxxd2010xxx  is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, and can be used as a monotherapy or in combination
with other antihypertensive drugs. the recommended
starting dose is 50 mg once daily and can be increased to
50 mg twice daily if adequate bp is not achieved within 4
weeks. higher doses are not recommended because they
have no additional effect on bp and pose a markedly
greater risk of hyperkalemia. the drug is contraindicated in
patients with serum potassium values higher than 5.5
meq/l; serum creatinine higher than 2.0 mg/dl in males
or higher than 1.8 mg/dl in females; creatinine clearance
slower than 50 mg/min; type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria; and in those taking inhibitors of cyp3a4 (eg,
erythromycin, verapamil). patients should not use potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes.  xxxd2010xxx  is available in 25- and 50-mg tablets.
the principal risk of  xxxd2010xxx  is hyperkalemia, which
can be potentially fatal. patients who develop hyperkalemia

(<5.5 meq/l) might benefit from  xxxd2010xxx  with appropriate dosage adjustments as suggested by the manufacturer.

conclusions
aldosterone, which was once thought to act only on the
kidney mr, has been shown to bind to receptors in the
brain, the heart, and the vasculature. recent research studies have also implicated aldosterone in a variety of disease
processes that involve the heart, kidneys, and blood vessels. attempts to ameliorate these detrimental effects
through aldosterone blockade have been successful, using
spironolactone, a nonspecific blocker, and  xxxd2010xxx , a
specific blocker. both drugs are approved for use in hypertension, and as adjunct treatment in patients with chf.
additional investigations are necessary to further elucidate
the pathophysiologic role of aldosterone in cardiovascular
disease, and to determine how  xxxg1602xxx  blockers can prevent the hormone’s unfavorable actions.
