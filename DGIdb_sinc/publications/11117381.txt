effect of  xxxd2884xxx  and oxfenicine on myocardial function and metabolism during low-flow ischemia/reperfusion in the isolated rat heart.   xxxd2884xxx  is a potent prophylactic anti- xxxd1914xxx  agent that has been shown to inhibit myocardial utilization of  xxxd2154xxx  and to inhibit the mitochondrial enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase (cpt)-1. we compared the hemodynamic and biochemical effects of  xxxd2884xxx  (0.5 and 2.0 microm) and of another cpt-1 inhibitor, oxfenicine (0.5 mm), in langendorff-perfused rat hearts subjected to 60 min of low-flow ischemia (95% flow reduction) followed by 30 min of reperfusion. both  xxxd2884xxx  (2 microm only) and oxfenicine attenuated (p < 0.003, p < 0.0002, respectively) increases in diastolic tension during ischemia, without significant effects on developed tension, or on cardiac function during reperfusion. myocardial concentrations of long-chain acylcarnitines (lcac), products of cpt-1 action, were decreased (p < 0.05) by oxfenicine, unaffected by 2 microm  xxxd2884xxx , and increased slightly by 0.5 microm  xxxd2884xxx .  xxxd2884xxx , but not the active metabolite of oxfenicine, also inhibited cardiac cpt-2 with similar ic50 and emax, although lower hill slope, compared with cpt-1. oxfenicine, but not  xxxd2884xxx , reduced concentrations of the endogenous cpt-1 inhibitor, malonyl-coa.  xxxd2884xxx , but not oxfenicine, inhibited myocardial release of lactate during normal flow. we conclude that (a)  xxxd2884xxx  protects against diastolic dysfunction during ischemia in this model, independent of major changes in lcac accumulation and (b) this may result from simultaneous effects of  xxxd2884xxx  on myocardial cpt-1 and cpt-2.
