abstract

background and objectives: fentanyl effervescent buccal tablets (febt) are
designed to enhance the rate and efficiency of fentanyl absorption through the
buccal mucosa. this study was undertaken to characterise the pharmacokinetics
and assess the dose proportionality of febt in healthy volunteers within the
potential therapeutic dose range.
methods: twenty-five healthy adults (mean age 33 years) completed a single-dose, randomised, open-label, four-dose, four-period, crossover study of
febt. they were administered febt 200, 500, 810 or 1080mug. the subjects in
this study were not opioid tolerant; therefore, naltrexone was administered to
block any opioid receptor–mediated effects of fentanyl. venous blood samples for
measurement of serum fentanyl concentrations were obtained over 36 hours
following dosing. adverse events were recorded throughout the study.
results: the pharmacokinetics of febt were characterised by an absorption
phase with a median time to reach maximum serum concentration (tmax) of
0.75–0.99 hours that was consistent irrespective of dose. mean serum fentanyl
concentrations exhibited a biexponential decline from peak after febt 200 and
500mug doses and a triexponential decline after febt 810 and 1080mug doses. the
maximum serum concentration (cmax) of fentanyl was proportional up to and
including the 810mug dose. the increase in cmax was 20% less than proportional at
the 1080mug dose. systemic exposure to fentanyl, as measured by the area under
the serum concentration–time curve from time zero to infinity (auc∞), increased
proportionally with increasing doses of febt (200–1080mug). no serious adverse
events were reported during the study.
conclusion: the pharmacokinetics of febt were characterised by a high early
fentanyl concentration as a result of absorption across the buccal mucosa of the
oral cavity, which results in bypassing first-pass metabolism. this high early tmax
contributed to enhanced early systemic fentanyl exposure. maximum concentration and auc∞ of febt increased in a dose-proportional manner from 200 to
810mug. this study provides preliminary pharmacokinetic data for febt across
the potential therapeutic dose range.

background
fentanyl effervescent buccal tablets (febt)
[cephalon, inc., frazer, pa, usa] are a novel formulation of fentanyl designed to provide rapid absorption of fentanyl through the buccal mucosa,
which bypasses first-pass metabolism. fentanyl is a
well studied opioid with a 40-year history of use as
an anaesthetic and analgesic.[1] it is a potent opioid mu
receptor agonist, with the primary sites of therapeutic action being these receptors in the brain. in
individuals who are not opioid tolerant, fentanyl is
analgesic at blood levels of 1–2 ng/ml. in opioidtolerant individuals, the level at which fentanyl is
analgesic depends upon the degree of opioid tolerance.[2,3] the elimination of fentanyl from the body
is governed by its metabolism in the liver and in the
intestinal mucosa by cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4
isoform to the inactive metabolite norfentanyl.[2,3]
fentanyl is highly lipophilic at ph values >8.4
(the acid dissociation constant of fentanyl) and can
be absorbed through biological membranes, whereas
at ph levels <8.4, it becomes ionised and dissolves
more readily in aqueous solutions.[4] febt are formulated using the oravescent® 1 drug delivery
technology (cima labs, inc., eden prairie, mn,
usa) to produce an effervescent reaction, which
improves the rate and efficiency of fentanyl absorption through the buccal mucosa, increasing early
systemic exposure.[5-7] in the effervescent reaction,
it is hypothesised that transient ph changes may
optimise dissolution and membrane permeation of
fentanyl. upon placement of the tablet in the buccal
cavity, the effervescent reaction is initiated, causing
liberation of carbon dioxide. this release facilitates
disintegration of the tablet and is hypothesised also
to produce a decrease in ph in the microenvironment around the tablet, thus driving the fentanyl into
solution. as the effervescent reaction continues and
a ph-modifying substance ( xxxd3212xxx ) dissolves, a subsequent rise in ph increases the fraction
of the fentanyl dose that is non-ionised, and thus
facilitates its rapid absorption through the buccal
mucosa.[5]

the present study was designed to investigate the
pharmacokinetics and assess the dose proportionality of febt (200, 500, 810 and 1080mug) in healthy
volunteers across a potential therapeutic dose range.
methods
subjects

eligible volunteers were men and women aged
19–55 years with normal findings with regard to
medical history, physical examination (height,
bodyweight, frame size, vital signs and ecg) and
clinical laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, hiv antibody screen, hepatitis b
surface antigen screen, hepatitis c antibody screen,
serum pregnancy test [females only]) within 21 days
prior to enrolment in the study. to be included,
volunteers had to have negative results on screening
for cannabinoids and opioids and to have been nicotine and tobacco free for at least 6 months prior to
enrolment. in addition, over-the-counter medications (including herbal supplements) were prohibited 7 days prior to dosing and during the study.
prescription medications (including  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors as a precaution to reduce the risk of
respiratory depression) were not allowed 14 days
prior to dosing and during the study (with the exception of hormonal contraceptives for females). subjects were not to consume any alcohol-, broccoli-,
citrus-, caffeine- or xanthine-containing foods or
beverages for 48 hours prior to and during each
evaluation period. grapefruit was prohibited from
10 days prior to dosing and throughout the study. all
volunteers provided written informed consent prior
to study initiation.
study design

this was a single-dose, randomised, open-label,
four-dose, four-period, crossover study of febt in
healthy adults. twenty-eight subjects were
randomised to one of the following four possible
dose sequences: abdc; bcad; cdba; and
dacb, where a, b, c and d denote the 200, 500,

810 and 1080mug doses, respectively. there was a
7-day washout period between each dosing period
(figure 1). the study protocol was approved by the
mds pharma services institutional review board
(lincoln, ne, usa).
study protocol

subjects arrived at the centre in the afternoon of
the day prior to dosing. meals were provided, and
subjects fasted for 10 hours overnight before febt
administration. when subjects received febt, they
were instructed to place the tablet between the upper
gum and cheek above a molar tooth and allow it to
dissolve for 10 minutes. if subjects felt that after 10
minutes a portion of the tablet still remained, they
gently massaged the cheek in the area corresponding
to the location of the tablet for 5 minutes. subjects
were asked to inform study personnel when the
healthy subjects screened

tablet had completely dissolved. complete dissolution of the tablet was confirmed by visual observation of the administration site. the dwell time values
(the length of time that the tablet takes to fully
dissolve following buccal administration) were calculated by subtracting the medication administration
time from the time of perceived and documented
disappearance of the formulation. dwell times were
summarised by febt dose with descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [sd], coefficient of
variation [cv], standard error of the mean, sample
size, minimum, maximum and median).
following febt administration, subjects were to
remain seated, and drinking of water was restricted
for 4 hours. strenuous physical activity was not
allowed during the study. subjects were observed
for 36 hours after fentanyl administration.
venous blood samples (7ml) were collected at
the following times for subjects receiving doses of
febt 500, 810 or 1080mug: before administration
(hour 0); and 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 and 36 hours after administration. blood samples (7ml) were collected at the
following times for subjects receiving the febt
200mug dose: before administration (hour 0); and
0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14,
16, 20 and 24 hours after administration. blood
samples were not taken >24 hours following the
febt 200mug dose because preliminary studies indicated that fentanyl concentrations would be below
the limit of detection after 24 hours. blood samples
were allowed to clot at room temperature (21°c) and
then centrifuged (also at room temperature) to separate the serum. serum samples were frozen at –20°c
until analysed.
a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) method was used for the
quantification of fentanyl in human serum. internal
standard, d5-fentanyl, was added and the analyte and
internal standard were extracted from human serum
by liquid/liquid extraction under basic conditions.
serum extracts were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in an appropriate solvent before injection into the lc-ms/ms apparatus. positive ions
were monitored in the multiple reaction monitoring

mode. the linear range for the assay was 10–5000
pg/ml. for this study, the lower limit of quantitation
was raised to 50 pg/ml. samples <50.0 pg/ml were
recorded as 0.0. the method has shown selectivity
against naltrexone up to concentrations of 10 ng/
ml. in addition, stability of fentanyl was shown in
serum stored at –20°c for 32 weeks and stored at
room temperature for 24 hours. precision and accuracy of the assay during the sample analysis was
shown with a cv of ≤3.55% and a bias of ≤3.79%.
tolerability

naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, was
administered before and after administration of
febt to block the pharmacological effects of
fentanyl and reduce its potential opioid
receptor–mediated effects as subjects in this study
were not opioid tolerant. subjects assigned to febt
500, 810 or 1080mug received an oral dose of naltrexone 50mg at 15 hours and 3 hours prior to, and 12.2
hours following, administration of the fentanyl dose.
subjects assigned to febt 200mug received an oral
dose of naltrexone 50mg at 15 hours and 3 hours
prior to the fentanyl dose. co-administration of naltrexone with fentanyl has been shown not to interfere with the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl in
healthy subjects who were not opioid tolerant.[8]
fentanyl is a substrate of cyp3a4[2,3] and is not
known to inhibit or induce any cyp enzyme. naltrexone is not a substrate of cyp drug-metabolising
enzymes and, as such, its metabolism would not be
affected by drugs that induce or inhibit this system.
therefore, there is no potential for pharmacokinetic
interaction between fentanyl and naltrexone.
vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and respiration) were assessed each morning prior to dosing
(hour 0) and at regular intervals through 36 hours
after dosing. continuous pulse oximetry was conducted for the first 8 hours after dosing and whenever the subject tried to sleep in the first 12 hours after
dosing. at the completion of the study, a 12-lead
ecg, a clinical laboratory evaluation (haematology,
serum chemistry and urinalysis) and a physical examination with complete vital signs were performed.

subjects were instructed to inform the physician
and/or nurses of any adverse events that occurred
during the study. to monitor oral transmucosal delivery, oral cavities were inspected at the beginning
of each evaluation period to ensure that there were
no sores in the area of drug application for that
period. four hours after dosing, subjects were asked
how the area of drug application felt. the area was
also inspected by a nurse, who recorded the subjects’ answers and the results of the assessments.
pharmacokinetics

area under the serum concentration–time curve
from time zero to last measurable concentration
(auclast), auc from time zero to infinity (auc∞),
percent (%) extrapolated auc [auclast/auc∞],
terminal elimination rate constant (ke), terminal
elimination half-life (t1/2beta), maximum serum concentration (cmax) and time to reach cmax (tmax) were
computed using a non-compartmental approach.
auc from time zero to tmax′ (auctmax′) was calculated post hoc, where tmax′ = 0.99 hour (the median
tmax of the reference dose: febt 810mug). the febt
810mug dose was selected as the reference dose because it was approximately in the middle of the
range of doses studied and was likely to provide
blood levels of fentanyl above the limit of detection
for an extended period after administration. actual,
rather than nominal, sampling times were used in the
analyses.
statistical analyses

dose proportionality from 200 to 1080mug was
evaluated using a 90% confidence interval (ci) on
the slope, beta, of the regression line according to
equation 1:
ln(pk ) = a + b ln(dose) + e
(eq. 1)
where the random error term epsilon was modelled to
account for both intrasubject and intersubject variation (pk = pharmacokinetic variable, alpha = probability of type i error, beta = slope of the regression line).[9]
a mixed-effects model was implemented to provide
a 90% ci on the fixed effect of beta. if the ci fell
completely within the limits (0.8677, 1.1323), dose

proportionality from 200 to 1080mug was concluded.
if the ci fell partially in the interval, then the results
were inconclusive, and the analysis was repeated for
doses from 200 to 810mug. if the ci fell completely
within the limits (0.8405, 1.1595), dose proportionality from 200 to 810mug was concluded.
results
twenty-eight healthy, white, adult volunteers
(16 male, 12 female; mean [sd] age 33 [13] years;
mean [sd] body mass index 23.9 [2.79] kg/m2)
were enrolled, and 25 subjects (14 male, 11 female)
completed the study. three subjects discontinued
from the study. two subjects requested to be withdrawn prior to study period 3. one subject discontinued following dosing in study period 2 because of
adverse events consisting of vomiting, bilateral arm
and shoulder pain, and chest pain. the numbers of
subjects receiving various doses of febt were as
follows: 25 subjects at 200mug, 26 subjects at 500mug,
27 subjects at 810mug and 27 subjects at 1080mug.

pharmacokinetics

mean serum fentanyl concentration-time curves
for the febt 200, 500, 810 and 1080mug doses are
shown in figure 2. pharmacokinetic parameters of
febt doses are given in table i. mean serum
fentanyl concentrations exhibited a biexponential
decline from peak after febt 200 and 500mug doses
and a triexponential decline after 810 and 1080mug
doses. in this study, the later portions of the profiles
were difficult to characterise for many subjects,
particularly at the lower dose levels, because of the
dynamic nature of this phase. this difficulty is reflected in the range of t1/2beta values (6.48–12.8h, table
i). the tmax was independent of dose across the four
doses (median values = 0.75–0.99h).
early fentanyl exposure, as measured by mean
auctmax′, ranged from 0.37 to 1.56 ng • h/ml
across groups (table i). auctmax′ is a partial auc
reflective of early systemic exposure.[10] this parameter is the auc of each dose truncated at the

the slope of ln(auc∞) versus ln(dose), at
0.9983, was close to 1, and the 90% ci was completely contained within the critical range (0.8677,
1.1323) required for dose proportionality from 200
to 1080mug. these results indicate that an increase in
dose resulted in predictable increases in exposure
over the dose range (figure 3). all values of the
dose-proportionality assessments are given in table
ii.
in an analysis to assess the dose proportionality
in cmax across the full dose range from 200 to
1080mug, the slope of ln(cmax) versus ln(dose) was
0.8746. this was <1, and the 90% ci (0.8145,
0.9347) was not completely contained within the
critical range required for the conclusion of dose
proportionality (table ii). since the 90% ci was
partially within the critical range, dose proportionality was considered inconclusive by the smith
method.[9] therefore, dose proportionality in cmax
also was assessed across the narrower dose range of
200–810mug (table ii). the increases in fentanyl

cmax were dose proportional from 200mug up to and
including 810mug (figure 3). comparison of the
means of the cmax dose from the 1080mug dose to the
lower doses showed a 20% decrease from what was
expected.
the mean dwell times for febt in the oral cavity
were within the range of 14–17 minutes, showing
great variability. an exploratory analysis of plots of
pharmacokinetic parameters (auctmax′, cmax and
tmax) versus dwell time was generated. visual inspection of the plots showed that the dwell time of
febt did not affect absorption of fentanyl.
tolerability

all subjects received naltrexone prior to and following each febt administration, thereby blocking
the opioid receptor–mediated effects of fentanyl.
the combination of naltrexone and febt in these
healthy subjects who were not opioid tolerant was
generally well tolerated. all reported adverse events
were mild to moderate in nature. there were two
reports of minor oral mucosal irritation and one
report of redness following administration of febt,

all in the upper buccal area at the gum line. the
occurrences of irritation resolved within 6–24 hours.
the redness resolved in <11 hours. there was also
one report of pain in the upper buccal area at 11
minutes after administration of febt, which resolved within 4 hours after dosing. there were no
deaths or serious adverse events in this study.
discussion and conclusions
the pharmacokinetic profile of febt showed
dose-proportional increases in cmax and auc∞ with
increased dose. serum fentanyl cmax was dose proportional across the febt 200–810mug dose range.
in the dose range of 200–1080mug, analyses indicated
a tendency for less than proportional increases in
fentanyl cmax above febt 810mug. the buccal mucosa at the site of tablet placement is believed to act
as a ‘depot’ for absorption of fentanyl following
administration of febt. a sharper cmax with a
© 2005 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

steeper decline from peak was observed following
administration of febt 810mug as compared with
the shape of the curve following administration of
febt 1080mug. the less than proportional increase
in cmax was offset by more sustained serum concentrations around the peak that resulted in proportional
increases in overall systemic exposure (as assessed
by auc∞) following the 1080mug dose. this was
likely a result of saturation of the buccal mucosa at
the site of tablet placement, which caused fentanyl
absorption to occur more slowly. additional
pharmacokinetic evaluations of febt are required
to clarify what impact the surface area at the point of
contact with febt may have on the pharmacokinetic profile observed. across the range of
200–1080mug, febt proved dose proportional when
total systemic fentanyl exposure (auc∞) was calculated.
the estimated mean t1/2beta ranged from approximately 6.5 hours to approximately 13 hours. this
large observed range of estimated mean t1/2beta was
attributable to the incomplete characterisation of the
terminal elimination phase, where serum concentrations at sampling times later in the profile were not
quantifiable for many subjects, particularly at lower
doses. following absorption, fentanyl exhibits a
triexponential decline from peak serum concentration. the triexponential decline of serum concentrations of fentanyl in this study was consistent with the
known pharmacokinetic profile of fentanyl.
fentanyl is known to be distributed rapidly from the
serum into highly perfused tissues such as the brain,
heart and lungs.[2] the rapid distribution of fentanyl
into the brain is thought to account for the rapid
onset of fentanyl-induced analgesia.[2,11] this first
phase is followed by an elimination/gastrointestinal
absorption phase and a final slower phase of redistribution between deep tissue compartments (muscle
and adipose tissue) and serum.[2,11] the final phase
of redistribution accounts for a small portion of the
overall systemic exposure, and the observed t1/2beta is
representative of elimination from this deep tissue
compartment. therefore, the pharmacokinetic t1/2beta is
not reflective of the duration of action.

in a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
study, the concentration of fentanyl in blood has
been shown to correlate closely with reports of
analgesia.[12] following febt administration, there
was a rapid and substantial early absorption, as
shown by the cmax, tmax and auctmax′ values.
fentanyl exposure (auc∞) was shown to be linear
with increasing doses of febt between 200 and
1080mug, indicating that an increase in dose results in
predictable increases in systemic exposure over this
range. fentanyl cmax increased proportionally up to
and including the 810mug dose and less than proportionally at the highest dose (20% smaller increase).
the tmax was independent of dose. given the
pharmacokinetic profile of febt seen in this study,
the absorption of fentanyl may correlate closely with
the temporal characteristics of breakthrough pain,
and may be effective as a rapid-onset opioid appropriate for the treatment of breakthrough pain. the
effect of febt in patients with breakthrough pain
associated with cancer and non–cancer-related
chronic pain needs to be evaluated in randomised,
controlled clinical studies. the data from this study
describe the pharmacokinetic profile of febt and
the anticipated therapeutic dose range for febt.
