abstract
the six mutations, referred to as the hex mutations, that together have been shown to convert escherichia
coli aspartate aminotransferase (aatase) specificity to be substantially like that of e. coli  xxxg2250xxx  (tatase) are dissected into two groups, (t109s/n297s) and (v39l/k41y/t47i/n69l). the
letters on the left and right of the numbers designate aatase and tatase residues, respectively. the
t109s/n297s pair has been investigated previously. the latter group, the “grease” set, is now placed in the
aatase framework, and the retrogrease set (l39v/y41k/i47t/l69n) is substituted into tatase. the
grease mutations in the aatase framework were found primarily to lower kms for both aromatic and
dicarboxylic substrates. in contrast, retrogrease tatase exhibits lowered kcats for both substrates. the six
retrohex mutations, combining retrogrease and s109t/s297n, were found to invert the substrate specificity
of tatase, creating an enzyme with a nearly ninefold preference (kcat/km) for aspartate over phenylalanine.
the retrohex mutations perturb the electrostatic environment of the  xxxd3047xxx  cofactor, as
evidenced by a spectrophotometric titration of the internal aldimine, which uniquely shows two pkas, 6.1
and 9.1. retrohex was also found to have impaired dimer stability, with a kd for dimer dissociation of 350
nm compared with the wild type kd of 4 nm. context dependence and additivity analyses demonstrate the
importance of interactions of the grease residues with the surrounding protein framework in both the
aatase and tatase contexts, and with residues 109 and 297 in particular. context dependence and
cooperativity are particularly evident in the effects of mutations on kcat/km(asp). effects on kcat/km(phe)
are more nearly additive and context independent.

a central problem in the area of structural biology is that of
identifying the functionally important amino acid residues
of an enzyme and of quantitating their individual and context dependent contributions. many of the proteins whose
sequences have been elucidated by genomics remain uncharacterized. families of such proteins, which may be
quite diverse in function or substrate specificity, provide an
opportunity to study putative functionally important residues by creating chimeras in which residues from one sequence are transferred into another. the results have implications both for the study of protein function and for enzyme redesign.
several successful examples of enzyme substrate specificity redesign inspired by analyses of homologous sequences have been reported. subtilisin has been engineered

specificity determinants of aminotransferases

to exhibit the substrate specificities of the related serine
proteases kex2 (ballinger et al. 1995) and furin (ballinger et
al. 1996). the substrate specificity of trypsin has been converted to that of chymotrypsin (hedstrom et al. 1992). comparison of isocitrate dehydrogenase and isopropylmalate dehydrogenase prompted the design of mutants with inverted
preferences for nad versus nadp as cofactors (chen et al.
1996). cronin (1998) used sequence comparisons of choline
acetyltransferases and carnitine acetyltransferases to design
a mutant  xxxg440xxx  that displays a >1600fold improvement in kcat/km for carnitine.
onuffer and kirsch (1995) selected six escherichia coli
aspartate aminotransferase (aatase) residues that were
thought to dictate substrate specificity. their replacement
with the corresponding residues from e. coli  xxxg2250xxx  (tatase) yielded an enzyme, designated hex,
with substantial aromatic aminotransferase activity. subsequently, luong and kirsch (2001) further clarified the roles
of the amino acids at positions 109 and 297 by studying the
single and double mutants of these positions in both the
aatase to tatase and tatase to aatase direction. position 109 was found to be crucial to dicarboxylic substrate
recognition and position 297 to aromatic substrate recognition. they further presented a general quantitative metric to
analyze the context dependence and energetic impact of
forward and retro chimeric substitutions.
this work examines the roles of the remaining four residues, 39, 41, 47, and 69, collectively known as the grease
residues, in the substrate specificity of aatase and
tatase. these four amino acids were mutated in tandem
because they line the upper surface of the active site, and
all are substitutions from more polar (aatase) to less polar
(tatase). they were therefore postulated to provide a
better hydrophobic binding surface for nonpolar substrates.
kinetic and spectrophotometric data for the grease
aatase, retrogrease tatase, and retrohex tatase mutants are presented. context dependence and impact analysis are applied to the grease/retrogrease and hex/retrohex
mutant pairs.

effects of mutations of these residues in aatase and
tatase were described (luong and kirsch 2001). the remaining four residues—39, 41, 47, and 69—affect the polarity of the active site; they are less polar in tatase than
in aatase. these four residues are collectively referred to
as the “grease” residues.

results
the aminotransferase mutants described here were constructed to define the roles played in substrate specificity
determination by the six residues originally characterized in
the hex mutant of aatase. mutation of these six residues
in aatase to their equivalents in tatase was sufficient to
increase the activity for phenylalanine by >1500-fold, as
measured by single turnover kinetics (onuffer and kirsch
1995). new steady-state data reported below confirm this
substrate specificity shift. table 1 illustrates how subsets of
these six positions were targeted for mutagenesis in aatase
and tatase to produce the mutants described here.

the kinetic data used to determine these parameters for
grease aatase, retrogrease tatase, and retrohex
tatase. previous work on the t109s, n297s, and t109s/
n297s mutants of aatase showed that mutations of
aatase towards the tatase sequence decrease kcat/km for
aspartate. this generalization holds for grease and hex
aatase as well: grease exhibits a decrease of 28-fold in
kcat/km for aspartate compared with wild-type aatase,
whereas hex shows a decrease of threefold. trip aatase
(v39l/t47i/n69l) is the sole exception, exhibiting a modest (less than twofold) increase in kcat/km for aspartate compared with wild type. in all three mutants, the changes in
activity result from changes in both kcat and km.
the trip, grease, and hex aatase mutants show increased phenylalanine activity compared with wild-type
aatase. the kcat/km values for phe are enhanced 16- to
19-fold in the trip and grease mutants, respectively. hex
aatase achieves an impressive 310-fold increase in kcat/
km compared with that of wild type. these six mutations
suffice to bring this parameter to within a factor of thirty of
wild-type tatase.
retrogrease and retrohex, the mutations of tatase towards the aatase sequence, show the expected large decreases in activity toward phenylalanine. retrogrease
shows a 24-fold drop in kcat/km for phenylalanine compared
with wild-type tatase, whereas retrohex has a kcat/km for
phenylalanine that is 690-fold lower than that of wild type.
retrogrease and retrohex also result in decreased activity
2850

protein science, vol. 11

for aspartate, although the effects are more modest than
those seen in most of the aatase mutants. in retrogrease
tatase, the kcat/km for aspartate is 15-fold lower than that
of wild type. retrohex tatase has a kcat/km for aspartate
that is only threefold lower than that of wild-type tatase.
in both of these mutants, the decreases in aspartate activity
result almost entirely from the reduction of kcat, with little
effect seen on km.
association of inhibitors with aatases and tatases
ki and kd values for maleate and hydrocinnamate (hca)
inhibition of aatase and tatase variants are given in
table 3. figure 3 shows titration data used to determine kds
for grease aatase and retrogrease tatase. figure 4
presents kinetic data for retrohex tatase with the two
inhibitors. the grease and hex mutants of aatase show
considerably increased affinity for both the aspartate analog, maleate, and the phenylalanine analog, hca. the mutations of tatase towards the aatase sequence do not
affect the kd(hca) values outside of a ±3-fold range, while
the effects on kd(maleate) range from a 15-fold reduction
(s109t) to >3-fold increase (s297n).

aatase, retrogrease tatase, and retrohex tatase are

presented in figure 5. the spectrum of grease aatase
(fig. 5a) and its variation with ph are nearly identical to
those of wild-type aatase. the pka of the internal aldimine, as determined by spectrophotometric titration, is
6.91 ± 0.05, indistinguishable from the value of 6.96 ± 0.02
reported for wild-type aatase (goldberg et al. 1991). retrogrease tatase (fig. 5b) has an internal aldimine pka of
6.32 ± 0.03, which is shifted downward by 0.33 pk units
from that reported for wild-type tatase (hayashi et al.
1993).
the spectrum of retrohex tatase (fig. 5c) is unique in
this series. it has a significant absorbance peak at 320 nm,
in addition to the usual ones at 360 and 430 nm. the enzyme
also has substantial residual 430 nm absorbance at high ph.
finally, data for the 320, 360, or 430 nm absorbance as a
function of ph fit best to a model incorporating two pkas
(equation 9) rather than the single pka observed in all other
aatases and tatases (fig. 5d). the two pka’s are 6.1 ±
0.2 and 9.1 ± 0.1.
dissociation of retrohex to inactive monomers
retrohex loses activity when diluted in buffer prior to the
addition of substrate. the rate of loss is slow and levels off

to a baseline level of activity after ∼ 15 min. the percentage
of activity retained is a function of enzyme concentration
(fig. 6a).
these observations are consistent with a model in which
the dimeric enzyme, upon dilution into the assay buffer,
slowly dissociates and comes to equilibrium with the inactive monomer. based on this model, measurements of enzyme activity after incubation at various dilutions could be
fit to equations 10 and 11 (see materials and methods) to
give a kd of 350 nm. the comparable dissociation constant
for wild-type aatase is 4 nm (herold and kirschner 1990).
discussion
specificity determinants of aatase and tatase
onuffer and kirsch (1995) identified six residues in
aatase, which, when mutated to their tatase counterparts, were sufficient to increase kcat/km for phenylalanine
by >300-fold, conferring a tatase-like substrate specificity
on the enzyme. luong and kirsch (2001) subsequently
clarified the roles of the residues at positions 109 and 297.
the functions of the other four positions, collectively
known as the grease residues, had not been examined. the

question of whether the six retro mutations would convert
tatase specificity to resemble that of aatase was of particular additional interest. these topics are addressed in this
paper.
the sequences of many additional homologous aromatic
aminotransferases have recently become available. some of
these manifest their substrate specificity differences from
aatase with substitutions other than the six characterizing
the hex mutant (jensen and gu 1996). the evolutionary
pathways leading to the divergence of present-day aatases
and tatases are the subject of ongoing work in this and
other laboratories and will be discussed elsewhere (s. rothman and j.f. kirsch, unpubl.).
kinetics and inhibitor binding
wild-type aatase and wild-type tatase differ in kcat/
km(asp) by only 2.5-fold (table 2). it might therefore be
expected that mutations in either the aatase → tatase or
tatase → aatase direction would have little effect on
aspartate activity. as the data of table 2 illustrate, hex
aatase bears out this expectation, with a kcat/km for aspartate that is nearly identical to that of wild-type tatase.
however, the grease aatase mutant exhibits a 28-fold
lower kcat/km(asp) than does wild-type aatase. this il2852

protein science, vol. 11

lustrates the large degree of interaction between the grease
and the t109s/n297s mutations. individually, grease
aatase and t109s/n297s aatase each have lower aspartate activity than does wild-type tatase, but when the two
are combined in hex aatase, aspartate activity is recovered. a similar cooperativity is displayed in the tatase
framework: kcat/km(asp) for retrogrease tatase is 15-fold
lower that of wild-type tatase; the addition of s109t/
s297n to form retrohex tatase restores asp activity to
within threefold of wild-type tatase.
the effects of the grease, retrogrease, and retrohex mutations on phe activity are more straightforward: all mutations from tatase → aatase decrease phe activity,
whereas mutations in the aatase → tatase direction augment it. cumulatively, the effect in retrohex is to create an
enzyme with an aatase-like substrate specificity.
the maleate and hca dissociation constants of the three
mutants further clarify the role of the four grease residues
(table 3). grease aatase has high affinity for both the
dicarboxylic and aromatic inhibitors, suggesting that these
four mutations serve to increase binding energy for the corresponding substrates. the reverse substitutions of retrogrease, however, have little effect on the affinity for inhibitors. these effects correlate well with the kinetic data on
these mutants: grease aatase has dramatically lowered
kms for both substrates, whereas retrogrease tatase
shows only small changes in km(asp) and an eightfold
change in km(phe). the addition of s109t/s297n to retrogrease to form retrohex tatase results in greatly restored
maleate affinity and a modest decrease in kd for hca. this
is consistent with the effect of the s109t/s297n mutations
in the wild-type tatase framework, where the effect is
manifested primarily in a decreased kd value for maleate.
spectrophotometric titrations
most aminotransferases exhibit low ph absorption bands
with maxima near 430 nm, characteristic of the protonated
internal aldimine depicted in figure 7, structure i. deprotonation of the aldimine yields the form of the cofactor
shown in structure iii, which absorbs maximally at 360 nm.
the pka of this transition is 6.96 in wild-type aatase
(goldberg et al. 1991) and 6.65 in wild-type tatase (hayashi et al. 1993).
the grease aatase mutations have no effect on this
internal aldimine pka, showing that they do not perturb the
electrostatic environment of the active site in the aataseto-tatase direction. however, the mutations in the
tatase-to-aatase direction do shift the pka downward by
0.33 units.
retrohex exhibits an unusual spectrum, indicating that
this set of mutations introduces substantial changes in the
cofactor environment. the 320-nm absorbance peak present
in the spectrum is most likely attributable to the enolimine

circles). conditions and values are given in table 3.

tautomer of the protonated schiff’s base (fig. 7, structures
ii and v). this tautomer has been observed in model systems in solution and is favored in hydrophobic environments. metzler (1979) suggested that aatase uses specific
hydrogen-bonding interactions to stabilize the 430-nm absorbing ketoenamine (i) over the enolimine tautomer(ii). it
is probable that the hydrogen bond from tyrosine 225 to the
3⬘ oxygen of plp contributes importantly to this stabilization. the presence of a strong hydrogen bond here would
prevent the addition of a second proton to the 3⬘ oxygen,
which occurs in the tautomerization of ketoenamine (fig. 7,
structure i) to enolimine (fig. 7, structure ii). the evidence

thus points to a weaker tyrosine 225–3⬘ oxygen hydrogen
bond in retrohex than that which exists in wild-type
tatase.
the residual 430-nm absorbance found in retrohex at
high ph is explained by the transfer of a proton to the
aldimine nitrogen of iii. this proton most reasonably emanates from tyrosine 225 (fig. 7, structure iv). this is another indicator of the weakening of the tyrosine 225–3⬘
oxygen hydrogen bond in retrohex, as the weakened hydrogen bond would increase the acidity of tyrosine 225,
allowing for a more favorable proton transfer to the aldimine nitrogen.

the a224i mutant of aatase (eliot and kirsch 2002)
shares the 320-nm absorbance peak and residual 430-nm
absorbance at high ph with retrohex. these characteristics were attributed to the weakened tyrosine 225–3⬘ oxygen hydrogen bond caused by the bulky isoleucine introduced at position 224, which pushes the plp cofactor
away from the tyrosine. however, the a224i mutant does
not exhibit the other unusual feature of the retrohex spectrophotometric ph titration: the presence of two pkas
rather than one. the second pka in retrohex is explained
by a dissociation of the second proton, leaving a deprotonated internal aldimine and a deprotonated tyrosine 225 in
the active site (fig. 7, structure vi). presumably, this second transition has a high enough pka to remain outside the
range of the ph titration in the case of a224i.

dissociation of retrohex to monomers
aatase and tatase active sites are formed by contributions from both subunits; therefore, the monomers are inactive. the retrohex set of mutations is unique among those
investigated here, because it serves to reduce the stability of
the dimer by >70-fold.
of the six hex residues, 39, 69, and 297 make contacts
across the dimer interface. val 39 is 3.2 å from asn 69
from the opposite monomer in the crystal structure of wildtype aatase. asn 297 is within 4 å of phe 79 and arg 266
from the other monomer. contacts made by these residues
in wild-type tatase must be important for dimer stability
and may be disrupted in retrohex. the context dependence
and cooperativity (non-additivity) of these mutations is

clear—neither retrogrease tatase (which contains the
l39v and l69n mutations) nor s297n tatase show
signs of dimer instability, nor does the hex mutant of
aatase.
context dependence analysis
the chimeras constructed by the exchange of putatively
important specificity residues between aatase and tatase
define their contributions quantitatively within the context
of the donating and accepting frameworks. the impact (i)
and context dependence (c) of the forward and retro exchanges are given by equations 1 and 2, respectively
(luong and kirsch 2001; deu et al 2002).
i = ⌬⌬gsa→

b

− ⌬⌬gb→

c = ⌬⌬gsa→

b

+ ⌬⌬gsb→

( 1)

a

a

( 2)

⌬⌬gsa → b is the ⌬⌬g on an addressed thermodynamic or
kinetic parameter from the forward substitution, whereas
⌬⌬gsb → a is that resulting from the retro substitution. the
parameter c describes the context dependence of the substitutions. context independent substitutions will produce
nearly equal and opposite values of ⌬⌬gsa → b and ⌬⌬gsb → a,
yielding a small c value. conversely, highly context dependent substitutions will yield ⌬⌬gss of differing magnitudes,
resulting in larger c values.
the i value completes the analysis by providing a measure of the energetic impact of the substitution on the parameter of interest. the i value is required to distinguish
cases of true context independence from the trivial result

where both i and c are near zero because the substitution
has little effect on the interrogated parameter.
⌬⌬gs values for both the aspartate and phenylalanine
aminotransferase kcat/kms of the grease/retrogrease and
hex/retrohex mutant pairs are shown in figure 8. for comparison, ⌬⌬g values computed for wild-type aatase considered as a “mutant” of wild-type tatase and for wildtype tatase considered as a “mutant” of wild-type aatase
are shown. these ⌬⌬gs are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. they illustrate the total free energy difference
on the addressed parameter characterizing the two wildtype proteins and are useful in gauging the magnitude of
the impact parameter for any given substitution. for example, the ⌬⌬gss computed for kcat/km(asp) clearly illustrate that the difference in reactivity for aspartate between the two wild-type enzymes is small and that the free
energy perturbations caused by the chimeric constructs are
also rather small. the effects of both sets of substitutions
on aspartate activity are highly context dependent, in that
mutations in either the aatase → tatase or the tatase
→ aatase direction decrease aspartate activity. this results in the relatively large c and small i values observed.
in contrast, the same substitutions are nearly context independent with respect to phenylalanine activity. these same
trends were observed by luong and kirsch (2001) for mutations at positions 109, 297, and 109/297. the effects on
aspartate activity are highly context dependent, whereas
those on phenylalanine activity are less so.
additivity
the 109/297 and grease/retrogrease mutations can also be
examined for additivity. wells (1990) proposed the use of

fig. 7. model accounting for the two pkas observed in the spectrophotometric titration of retrohex tatase and the retention by the
enzyme of substantial residual 430 nm absorbance at high ph (see fig. 5). at low ph, the enzyme is in prototropic equilibrium between
forms i (␭max ⳱ 430 nm) and ii (␭max ⳱ 320 nm). loss of a proton (pka ∼ 6.1) from i or ii gives rise to species iii (␭max ⳱ 360 nm),
iv (␭max ⳱ 430 nm), and v(␭max ⳱ 320 nm), which are also in prototropic equilibrium. the loss of a second proton (pka ∼ 9.1)
produces species vi (␭max ⳱ 360 nm).

equation 3 for quantitating additivity. ⌬⌬gs are computed
for mutants x and y and for the combined mutant x,y, and
the ⌬gi (interaction energy) is given by equation 3:
⌬⌬g共x,y兲 = ⌬⌬g共x兲 + ⌬⌬g共y兲 + ⌬gi

( 3)

⌬gi is a measure of the extent of non-additivity and is taken
as an indication that the mutated residues interact.
the ⌬⌬gs and ⌬gis computed for t109s/n297s
aatase, grease aatase, hex aatase, and the corresponding retro tatase mutations are shown in figure 9.
the ⌬⌬gs for the reactions with phenylalanine are more
nearly additive in both the aatase and tatase framework.
the effects of s109t/s297n mutations and the retrogrease
mutations are essentially perfectly additive, with a ⌬gi of
only 0.03 kcal/mole. the aatase mutants show slightly
more interaction between the t109s/n297s residues and
the four grease positions, giving a ⌬gi of 1.1 kcal/mole.
the interaction energies become larger when aspartate activity is considered. for s109t/s297n tatase and retro2856

protein science, vol. 11

grease tatase, ⌬gi is 1.6 kcal/mole. ⌬gi is 2.6 kcal/mole
for t109s/n297s aatase and grease aatase.
the ⌬gi values complement and confirm the picture provided by the context dependence parameters, c and i. the c
value measures the extent to which the interaction of a
residue or group of residues with its environment affects the
parameter of interest. the ⌬gi value measures the extent to
which the interaction of a residue or group of residues with
another mutated position or positions affects the parameter
of interest. often there will be a correlation of c with ⌬gi,
but this is not necessarily so.
materials and methods
site-directed mutagenesis
aatase and tatase mutants were constructed by pcr-based
site-directed mutagenesis. pcr reactions (100 ␮l) were carried
out for 25 cycles through 95°c (1 min), 55°c (1 min), and 75°c
(1.5 min). mutagenized reaction products were digested with restriction enzymes and ligated into either the puc 118 or puc 119
vectors cut with the same restriction enzymes. ligation mixtures

transamination of  xxxd233xxx  was followed by an mdh-coupled assay
in the presence of saturating ␣kg.  xxxd2433xxx  transamination was followed with ho–hxodh as the coupling enzyme, in the presence
of saturating ␣kg, as described by luong and kirsch (1997). in
both cases, the change in 340-nm absorbance attributable to conversion of nadh to nad by the coupling enzyme was measured.
reactions of grease and retrogrease were followed with a molecular devices spectramax 340 or spectramax 250 spectrophotometer equipped with a 96-well plate reader. reactions of
hex and retrohex were monitored on a perkin elmer lambda 6 or
uvikon 860 (kontron instruments, watford, uk) spectrophotometer. background rates measured in the presence of coupling enzymes were subtracted from those recorded after addition of the
aminotransferase. details of reaction conditions are given in table 2.
data were imported into kaleidagraph (synergy software,
reading, pa) and fit to the michaelis-menten equation. errors for
kcat/km were determined from equation 4, a transformation of the

the isolated plasmids were screened for the presence of mutagenized inserts using silent restriction sites introduced during mutagenesis. sequences were verified by automated dna sequencing

enzyme purification
aatase and tatase were overexpressed in e. coli mg204 (gift
from i. fotheringham, nutrasweet corp.) and purified according to

fig. 9. interaction between the t109s/n297s and grease mutants in
aatase and of the corresponding retro mutations in tatase. the top and

t109s/n297s, grease, and hex (or their corresponding retro mutants),
respectively. the bottom bar illustrates the interaction energy, ⌬gi, calculated from equation 3. a large ⌬gi indicates non-additivity of effects of
mutations and demonstrates the interdependence of the mutated positions
with respect to the addressed parameter.
