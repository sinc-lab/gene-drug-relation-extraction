type 2 vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  (vmat2), found in the
brain, is also expressed by b-cells of the pancreas in association
with insulin. preclinical experiments suggested that 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine pet–measured vmat2 binding might serve as a
biomarker of b-cell mass. we evaluated the feasibility of 11cdihydrotetrabenazine pet quantification of pancreatic vmat2
binding in healthy subjects and patients with long-standing
type 1 diabetes. methods: 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine pet was
performed on 6 patients and 9 controls. vmat2 binding potential
(bpnd) was estimated voxelwise by using the renal cortex as reference tissue. as an index of total pancreatic vmat2, the functional binding capacity (the sum of voxel bpnd · voxel volume)
was calculated. pancreatic bpnd, functional binding capacity,
and stimulated insulin secretion measurements were compared
between groups. results: the pancreatic mean bpnd was
decreased in patients (1.86 6 0.05) to 86% of control values
(2.14 6 0.08) (p 5 0.01). in controls, but not in patients, bpnd correlated with stimulated insulin secretion (r2 5 0.50, p 5 0.03). the
average functional binding capacity was decreased by at least
40% in patients (p 5 0.001). the changes in functional binding
capacity and bpnd were less than the near-complete loss of
stimulated insulin secretion observed in patients (p 5 0.001).
conclusion: these results suggest that 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine
pet allows quantification of vmat2 binding in the human pancreas. however, bpnd and functional binding capacity appear
to overestimate b-cell mass given the near-complete depletion
of b-cell mass in long-standing type 1 diabetes, which may be
due to higher nonspecific binding in the pancreas than in the renal cortex.

ype 1 diabetes begins when b-cells of the endocrine
pancreas are destroyed by an autoimmune process. once a
threshold loss of b-cell mass is reached, the pancreas is no
longer able to secrete sufficient insulin to maintain glucose
homeostasis. however, our understanding of the relationship of the decline in b-cell mass to the natural history of
the disease is limited, because our understanding is based
largely on indirect in vivo measures of b-cell mass or on
postmortem histologic studies of b-cell mass (1,2).
stimulated insulin secretion capacity is currently used as
an indirect measure of b-cell mass. in healthy animal
models, measurements of stimulated insulin secretion correlate well with b-cell mass measurements made ex vivo
(3). as metrics of b-cell function, however, insulin secretion measurements have limited ability to predict the
development of diabetes, particularly when intercurrent
metabolic or inflammatory stress (4) reversibly compromises b-cell function but not necessarily b-cell mass (5).
these limitations become evident when functional measurements are used to monitor disease progression (6). for
example, once exogenous insulin is begun at diagnosis and
hyperglycemia is controlled, previously poor b-cell function recovers. because of the slow rate of human b-cell
proliferation (2), this remission phase is believed to reflect
the reversibility of compromised b-cell function rather than
recovery of lost b-cell mass (7). in addition, because the
pancreas is a heterogeneous ‘‘hard-to-biopsy’’ organ, no
direct measure of b-cell mass is currently available and,
thus, b-cell mass cannot be distinguished from functional
defects of insulin secretion.
type 2 vesicular monoamine transporters (vmat2), the
proteins that translocate monoamines into storage vesicles,
are expressed not only in the monoaminergic neurons but
also in pancreatic b-cells. vmat2 is a better marker of the
integrity of the dopamine neurons than is the dopamine

transporter, because vmat2 is resistant to regulation by
drug exposure and neuronal degeneration (8). vmat2 is
not detectable in exocrine cells or in islet cells stained with
antiglucagon or somatostatin (9). the close association of
vmat2 and insulin has suggested that vmat2 might serve
as a biomarker of b-cell mass (10) independent of the
mechanics of insulin production. the function of vmat2
in b-cells is similar to its role in the central nervous system:
control of vesicular monoamine content. in b-cells, vesicular monoamines are thought to regulate insulin secretion
(11).
previous studies on radioligand development have identified low-molecular-weight vmat2 ligands, including
dihydrotetrabenazine, that are highly selective for vmat2.
dihydrotetrabenazine and its analogs developed for pet
are 10,000 times more selective for vmat2 than for
 xxxg2098xxx  (12) and bind to vmat2 with high affinity (0.5–
1 nm dissociation constant) (13,14). 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine was developed for use in imaging vmat2 in
dopaminergic neurons within the brain (15), and 11cdihydrotetrabenazine brain pet studies have shown that
vmat2 binding in the brain can be quantified and may be
used as a biomarker of the integrity of the presynaptic
dopamine neurons with potential applications in studies of
movement disorders (16).
recent studies on animal models of diabetes have
suggested that pet targeting of vmat2 in the pancreas
can be used as a biomarker of b-cell mass (17). in this 11cdihydrotetrabenazine pet study of patients with type 1 diabetes, we evaluated the feasibility of quantification of
vmat2 binding in the pancreata of healthy controls and
patients predicted to be nearly devoid of b-cell mass. we
also tested the hypothesis that the total pancreatic vmat2
functional binding capacity of long-standing type 1 diabetes
is markedly reduced. finally, we determined the correlation
of a b-cell functional measure, area-under-the-curve (auc)
c-peptide, with pet-based measurements of vmat2 binding in the pancreas.
materials and methods
subjects
fifteen subjects, consisting of patients with long-standing type
1 diabetes (n 5 6) and healthy controls (n 5 9), were enrolled in
this study. the key inclusion criteria for controls were a fasting
glucose level less than 100 mg/dl and no first-degree relative with
type 2 diabetes mellitus. the demographic and laboratory data of
the 9 controls and the 6 patients are summarized in table 1. all
subjects gave written informed consent for the study, which was
approved by the institutional review board and radiation safety
committees of columbia university.
metabolic testing
the subjects fasted at least 8 h before undergoing testing for
mixed-meal tolerance. before the testing, insulin was discontinued
in all patients; fasting blood sugar was required to range between
70 and 200 mg/dl at the start of the test. in 5 subjects treated with
continuous insulin infusion, no insulin boluses were administered

within 2 h of the testing, and the basal insulin was suspended 30
min before the test. serial samples of venous serum were assayed
for glucose (mg/dl), insulin (miu/ml), and c-peptide (ng/ml) by
standard methods. the c-peptide detection limit was 0.15 ng/ml.
from the c-peptide concentrations obtained at each time point during
the 120-min mixed-meal tolerance testing, the auc c-peptide was
calculated by the trapezoidal rule.
pet studies
11c-(1)dihydrotetrabenazine was synthesized as described
previously (18). pet data were acquired for 90 min (27 frames
consisting of six 10-s, three 60-s, two 120-s, and sixteen 300-s
frames) after the bolus injection of 370–740 mbq of 11cdihydrotetrabenazine (specific activity, 35–62 gbq/mmol at the
time of injection, and chemical purity . 95%) on an accel scanner
(cti-siemens) in 3-dimensional mode (47 image planes, 16.2-cm
axial field of view). after correction for attenuation, scatter, and
radioactive decay, pet data were reconstructed using filtered
backprojection with a hahn filter having a cutoff frequency of 0.5,
resulting in a full width at half maximum of 6.22 mm at 1 cm in
the tangential plane and 5.71 mm at 1 cm in the axial plane and a
total of 128 · 128 · 335 voxels (1 voxel 5 0.018 ml).
metabolite-corrected input function
four healthy subjects underwent multiple sampling of arterial
blood (25 times over 90 min). blood samples were separated into
plasma and a cellular fraction by centrifugation. selected plasma
fractions (n 5 6) were analyzed by radio–high-performance liquid
chromatography as previously described (19). the fraction of
parent radioligand in plasma was fitted to a sum of 2 exponentials.
a metabolite-corrected plasma curve was generated by the product of the plasma activity and metabolite fraction curves. the
portion of the metabolite-corrected plasma curve beyond the
initial peak was fit to a sum of 2 exponentials. the resulting
curve was used as the input function for estimation of vmat2
binding to validate the use of the reference tissue method without
the input function.

mri studies
mri studies were performed for guidance on the anatomic
location of the pancreas needed for the pet data analysis. each
subject was scanned on a 1.5-t twinspeed scanner (ge healthcare). four single-breath-hold sequences were used: the first was
axial t2-weighted single-shot fast spin echo (echo time, 90 ms;
repetition time, 645 ms). the second was axial 2-dimensional fast
imaging employing steady state acquisition (fiesta) with fat
saturation (echo time, 1.7 ms; repetition time, 3.8 ms; flip angle,
70). the third was coronal 2-dimensional fiesta with fat
saturation (echo time, 1.7 ms; repetition time, 3.8 ms; flip angle,
70). the fourth was axial liver acquisition with volume acquisition and fat saturation (echo time, 1.6 ms; repetition time, 3.6 ms;
inversion time, 7; flip angle, 15).

rationale for data analysis in pet studies
kinetic model–based quantification of vmat2 binding with
11c-dihydrotetrabenazine has previously been shown to be feasible for the brain (20). in this attempt to quantify vmat2 binding
in the human pancreas, we used a reference tissue model similar to
that used for the brain but with modifications adapted to the
pancreas.
the vmat2 distribution in the target organ, pancreas, is
different from that of striatum in the brain, because the pancreas
contains both the exocrine and the endocrine (b-cell), as well as
fat tissue. vmat2 is predominantly expressed in the insulinproducing b-cells within islets dispersed nonuniformly throughout
the pancreas (9). within the brain are regions devoid of vmat2,
such as the cerebellum, which can be applied as reference tissue to
quantify vmat2 without the use of the metabolite-corrected
arterial plasma input function. we chose the renal cortex as the
reference tissue, because it is devoid of vmat2 ( xxxg2098xxx  is
present in the renal cortex but 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine is highly
selective for vmat2) (12). the assumption made here is that the
nondisplaceable (hitherto described as nonspecific) distribution
volume (v9nd) times the free tissue fraction (fnd) is the same in
the pancreas and the reference tissue and that fndv9nd is similar
among patients and controls.
in animal models of diabetes, b-cell mass is frequently estimated by immunohistochemistry. serial sections of pancreas
tissue stained for insulin immunoreactivity are evaluated for total
pancreas area and total area of insulin-staining cells. the total
b-cell mass is calculated from the product of the average
fractional b-cell area and the mass of the pancreas (21). because
these density measurements of b-cell area are analogous to the
measure of vmat2 binding potential (bpnd) provided by pet,
and because of the close association between insulin and vmat2
(9), we reasoned that the product of voxel bpnd and voxel
volume, summed over the entire pancreas region of interest (roi)
(functional binding capacity), would be an appropriate estimate of
the total pancreatic vmat2 sites and that functional binding
capacity could be used as a biomarker of b-cell mass.
these considerations prompted us to evaluate voxelwise quantification of vmat2 binding (parametric imaging) using the renal
cortex as the reference tissue in order to calculate the total
vmat2 functional binding capacity of the pancreas. in addition,
our preliminary roi-based quantification analysis suggested the
presence of a significant amount of vmat2 binding signal in the
pancreas of patients, as was unexpected in view of the nearcomplete depletion of b-cell mass in long-standing type 1 diabetes

(1). to gain further insight, we evaluated the histogram distribution of the vmat2 binding measurements within the pancreas.
although anatomic delineation of the pancreas was aided by
the mri scans, respiratory motion on the pet scans made this
task difficult in several subjects. for this reason, delineation of the
pancreas based on the dynamic pet-image tissue segmentation
was also used.
estimation of vmat2 binding
vmat2 binding in the pancreas was estimated by the
2-parameter multilinear reference tissue model (mrtm2) (22).
mrtm2 allows voxelwise estimation of bpnd 5 fndbavail/kd,
which is linearly proportional to the vmat2 density (bavail),
where kd and fnd are the dissociation constant and fnd,
respectively, and r1 represents relative radioligand delivery
(r1 5 k1 =k91 , the ratio of delivery rate constants of the pancreas
to renal cortex), using a vmat2-free reference region (renal
cortex) instead of arterial data.
mrtm2 parametric imaging requires a priori estimation of the
reference tissue radioligand clearance rate constant, k92 , by the
3-parameter mrtm2 estimation using the roi time–activity
curve data of the target (pancreas) and reference regions (renal
cortex). these roi definitions were aided by reference to mri
scans, the r1 images generated by the preliminary mrtm2
imaging procedure described elsewhere (23,24), and a modification of algorithms that allows tissue segmentation of dynamic pet
images into volumes of interest exhibiting similar temporal
behavior and spatial features described previously (tissue segmentation) (25).
in the present study, we used the left renal cortex as the
reference region. intersubject variability in time–activity curve
data was less for the left kidney than for the right because of the
adjacent high liver radioactivity. in addition, left renal cortex data
expressed as standardized uptake value were similar in patients
and controls, with no differences in the areas under these time–
activity curves between the 2 groups (206 6 24 min vs. 203 6 32
min, p 5 0.87), suggesting that the nonspecific distribution
volume of the left renal cortex reference region (v9nd) is similar
for the 2 groups.
to validate the use of mrtm2 for voxelwise estimation of
bpnd as applied to the current 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine pet
data, we also estimated bpnd voxelwise by the traditional compartmental kinetic analysis using the metabolite-corrected arterial
plasma function in 4 controls. mrtm2 bpnd and corresponding
kinetic analysis bpnd were compared in a randomly selected 100
voxels in each of the 4 controls, with the relationship between the
2 sets of bpnd values analyzed by linear regression. all parameter
estimations, including parametric imaging, were performed using
the pet data analysis software pmod (pmod technologies).
vmat2 binding comparison
the pet-estimated vmat2 binding in the pancreas was
compared between the patient and control groups in 3 ways.
first, mean bpnd values over the 3-dimensional pancreatic volume were calculated for each subject and compared. second, the
sum of all individual pancreatic voxel bpnd values greater than
0.1 multiplied by the voxel volume (i.e., functional binding
capacity) was calculated for each subject. third, voxel bpnd data
were displayed as frequency distribution histograms and compared between the 2 groups.

 xxxd3330xxx  uptake in these organs reflected the catabolism of dihydrotetrabenazine by glucuronidation in liver
and excretion via bile and urine (26). in some subjects, 11cdihydrotetrabenazine uptake and washout were seen in the
gastric antrum. vmat2 expression has been reported in
this tissue (9). cluster analysis–based tissue classification
defined the kidney cortex and separated the pancreas from
other organs such as the small bowel and stomach (fig. 2).

metabolic testing

estimation of vmat2 binding in patients and controls

fasting c-peptide concentrations were near or below detection limits (0.15 ng/ml) in plasma of subjects with longstanding type 1 diabetes. total auc c-peptide during the
mixed-meal tolerance testing in patients was markedly
reduced to 2% of control values (p , 0.001) (table 2).

the pancreatic mean bpnd was decreased in patients
(1.86 6 0.05) to 86% of control values (2.14 6 0.08) (p 5
0.01) (table 2). in controls, but not in patients as expected,
the mean bpnd correlated significantly (r2 5 0.50, p 5
0.03) with auc c-peptide measures of insulin secretion
(fig. 3). the y-intercept of the regression line had a
nonzero bpnd value of 1.504. the functional binding
capacity was decreased in patients (44 6 11) to 40% of
control values (109 6 9) (p 5 0.001) (table 2; fig. 4). the
magnitude of decreases in these vmat2 indices in patients
was only moderate despite the fact that all patients had
long-standing type 1 diabetes with expected near-total
losses of b-cell mass as based on morphometric studies
of postmortem pancreata obtained from clinically similar
patients. we therefore examined the frequency distribution
histograms of pancreatic voxel bpnd and compared them
between patients and controls (figs. 4 and 5, top and
bottom panels). the histograms showed that the number of
relatively high bpnd voxels was more markedly reduced
than was the number of relatively low to moderate bpnd
voxels in patients, compared with controls, and corresponded more closely to the known loss of b-cell mass in

activity curves, expressed as standardized uptake value, in
the pancreas and left renal cortex of 1 representative control
and 1 representative patient. 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine uptake in the pancreas was excellent, peaking at around 10
min (maximum standardized uptake value of 10 and 8 for
controls and patients, respectively), with a relatively quick
washout for both groups. there was uptake in the renal
cortex, peaking early at around 1 min, with a faster
washout. these 2 organs thus showed reversible 11cdihydrotetrabenazine uptake.
in contrast, 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine uptake in the liver
increased progressively throughout the study. 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine uptake in the small bowel was slow, with

patients. the relative sparing of the voxels with relatively
low to moderate bpnd in patients accounted for the only
mild to moderate decreases in the mean bpnd values and
functional binding capacity (bpnd . 0.1) in patients (fig. 5).
the recognition of these findings prompted us to speculate on
the possibility that the low to moderate bpnd signal in
patients, rather than representing only b-cell mass, might be
either due to the higher 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine nonspecific binding in the pancreas than in the renal cortex or due to
the presence of non–b-cell vmat2 binding.
assuming these possibilities, we recalculated the functional binding capacity using only voxels with values of
bpnd greater than 2.5 as a method to remove the contribution of low to moderate bpnd signal assumed to represent nonspecific binding to the total vmat2 signal. at a
threshold bpnd of 2.5, functional binding capacity was
more markedly decreased in patients, to 28% of control
values (table 2; fig. 4, top panel inset). at higher thresh-

between controls and patients.

for mrtm2 parametric imaging of bpnd and r1, the
reference tissue clearance rate (left renal cortex), k92 , was
estimated by mrtm2. the k92 values did not differ (p 5
0.4) between patients (0.29 6 0.06 min21) and controls
(0.26 6 0.08 min21), and the ratio k92 =k2 was 4.4 6 1.4
(range, 3.2–9.1), where k2 is the tissue radioligand clearance from the pancreas. the major factors that affect the
accuracy of k92 by mrtm2 are the magnitude of k92 and the
ratio k92 =k2 (23). these results indicated that the potential
bias and variability of mrtm2 estimation of k92 was small
(less than a few percentage points).
in 4 controls with arterial plasma metabolite–corrected
input function, comparison of kinetic analysis bpnd, which
requires arterial input function, and mrtm2 bpnd, which
requires no arterial input function, showed that mrtm2

measurements of stimulated c-peptide and insulin secretion have been used to monitor changes in b-cell mass.
however, none of these approaches is capable of providing
direct measures of b-cell mass. previous feasibility studies
on rodents suggested that pet-based measurements of
vmat2 densities in the pancreas might be used as a
biomarker of b-cell mass (17).
in this 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine pet study, we attempted
to quantify pancreatic vmat2 binding in a cross-sectional
study of healthy volunteers and patients with long-standing
type 1 diabetes. in contrast to the findings of the 11cdihydrotetrabenazine pet studies of a rodent model of type
1 diabetes (17), the results of our human study suggest the
presence of a substantial amount of vmat2 binding signal in
the type 1 diabetic pancreas. the mean pancreatic bpnd in
patients was decreased by only 14%. the voxel bpnd histogram showed that voxels with low to moderate bpnd were
relatively spared in patients. the functional binding capacity
with consideration of only bpnd greater than 2.5 was markedly
reduced by 72% in patients. however, there was still a significant amount of vmat2 binding signal, even expressed as
functional binding capacity (bpnd . 2.5) (28% of control
values), in patients despite postmortem evidence that loss of
b-cell mass is nearly total in long-standing type 1 diabetes (27).
the results of the current human study then raise 2
questions: why is there a vmat2 binding signal in type
1 diabetic pancreata, and why are the results of the current
study different from those of previous rodent studies?
several nonexclusive explanations exist for the presence
of vmat2 binding signal in our human type 1 diabetic
pancreata. first, in our analysis, the renal cortex was used
to estimate dihydrotetrabenazine nonspecific binding in the
pancreas because vmat2 expression is undetectable in the
renal cortex and 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine is a highly
selective ligand for vmat2 (10,13). however, the nonspecific 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine binding may be greater in
the human pancreas than in the renal cortex because of
differences in cellular composition of the tissue, for example (28). should this be the case, our actual bpnd may
overestimate the true bpnd of the pancreata. that is, our
assumption that vnd equals v9nd may not be valid. this
overestimation of bpnd due to the underestimation of the
pancreatic nonspecific binding may represent the majority
of the vmat2 binding signal in type 1 diabetic pancreata
in this report. however, if this positive bias of bpnd is
systematic (i.e., bpnd is linearly proportional to b-cell
mass), our vmat2 binding measurements may be an index
of b-cell mass, although the sensitivity of detecting changes
in b-cell mass may be reduced.

in the present study, we chose the renal cortex because no
other organs within the field of view were suitable for use as
the reference tissue. other tissues, such as the oxyntic
stomach, express vmat2. liver is the site of metabolism
and excretion of 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine, and the bowel
contains radioactive bile. the adjacent muscle and soft-tissue
volumes were too small to provide adequate sampling of 11cdihydrotetrabenazine activity. although the left renal cortex
was suitable for the reference tissue in the mrtm2 analysis,
this organ may not be optimal for estimating nonspecific
binding in the pancreas, because the kinetics of 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine uptake in the kidney may be complex (26).
use of metabolite-corrected plasma instead of the reference tissue as an input function allows estimation of
nonspecific (vnd) and specific (vs) distribution volumes
separately in the pancreas. however, the vnd or vs estimated by this method is generally unreliable, although
estimates of the total distribution volume (vt 5 vnd 1 vs)
are reliable. therefore, even with plasma data, vnd is often
constrained to the value of the reference tissue (v9nd) to
estimate vs if such reference tissue exists. therefore, to
validate the use of the renal cortex as the reference tissue,
one must estimate nonspecific binding in the pancreas by
using alternate experimental approaches.
one such approach would be to block 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine binding with cold dihydrotetrabenazine in sufficient doses to block vmat2 binding sites completely. in
rodent experiments, cold dihydrotetrabenazine (2 mg/kg)
displaces 35%240% of the signal of the average standardized uptake value time–activity curve (60–120 min) for the
pancreas and suggests that nonspecific binding of 11cdihydrotetrabenazine in the pancreas is underestimated by
12% when the kidney cortex is used as a reference (14).
however, this approach is not clinically applicable because
of the side effects of blocking the  xxxg2099xxx  sites in the central
nervous system by the necessary pharmacologically active
doses of dihydrotetrabenazine.
another potentially confounding source of the vmat2
signal are the radioactive metabolites of 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine that may enter the pancreas because the blood–
brain barrier has no counterpart in the pancreas. this
possibility could complicate quantifications using metabolite-corrected plasma input function. in the present study,
the contribution of radioactive metabolites was assumed
negligible. however, in future studies, this metabolite issue
needs to be evaluated. in addition, radioactive metabolites
are excreted into bile that empties via the common duct and
sphincter of oddi into the duodenum at the head of the
pancreas. this contamination by bile activity may contribute to a vmat2 signal in the head of pancreas near the
sphincter of oddi. in future studies, this potential bile
contamination also needs to be addressed.
yet another origin of the residual signal in type 1 diabetic
pancreata might be vmat2 expressed within the pancreas
but not associated with the b-cell mass (e.g., neuronal cells or
immature b-cells). a recent examination of postmortem

pancreas tissue, representing pancreata studied here, showed
a linear correlation between vmat2 and insulin expression
in both health and disease, as well as a minor population of
vmat2-positive but insulin-negative cells (,1% total
vmat2-positive cell area) (saisho et al., unpublished data).
the second question generated by this initial human
study is why the magnitude of the pet signal in type
1 diabetic pancreata differs from our previous findings in
rodent models of diabetes (17). the differences in radioligand uptake may be related to differences in nonspecific
binding of 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine between the species,
the duration of disease, or inaccuracies of quantitation in
the rodent model due to slower kinetics of pancreatic tracer
uptake and washout or receptor saturation (29). a complete
explanation for the differences requires further study.
as predicted from studies of b-cell mass in animal models,
our primary outcome measure, bpnd, correlated significantly with the b-cell functional measure auc c-peptide in
controls but not in patients. the pet volumes were consonant with previous measurements of pancreata (30), and,
similar to already published reports (31) and as expected,
pancreatic pet volumes did not correlate with auc c-peptide.
the total pancreatic vmat2 functional binding capacity was
substantially less in patients than in controls, confirming our
working hypothesis, although the decreases were underestimated. our voxelwise analysis of 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine binding in our study population suggests that the
reduction in pancreas volume alone did not fully account
for the loss in functional vmat2 binding capacity observed
in the type 1 diabetes population. this suggestion arises from
2 observations: a reduction in the average bpnd in type 1
diabetic pancreata relative to control pancreata, and a
72% loss of functional binding capacity in type 1 diabetic
pancreata, with a bpnd of 2.5 or greater surpassing the
50% loss of the pet-measured pancreas volume.
our experience with rodent models of diabetes, as well
as our understanding of the natural variability in b-cell
mass (3- to 5-fold differences among individuals of similar
age or body mass index) (32), suggests that the potential
clinical value of this technique will lie in longitudinal,
rather than cross-sectional, studies in which changes in
b-cell mass are evaluated to predict the onset of diabetes or
to assess strategies to preserve b-cell mass. if validated in
longitudinal studies of human new-onset diabetes, pet
measurements of vmat2 binding capacity within the
pancreas may be a useful biomarker for b-cell mass. in
our future studies, however, we may choose to take advantage of novel 18f-analogs of dihydrotetrabenazine that
appear to possess higher vmat2 affinities and lower
nonspecific binding, in addition to the advantage of the
longer physical half-life of 18f (14).
conclusion

these results suggest that 11c-dihydrotetrabenazine pet
allows quantification of vmat2 binding in the human

pancreas. however, bpnd and functional binding capacity
appear to overestimate the b-cell mass in view of the
known near-complete depletion of b-cell mass in longstanding type 1 diabetes, which may be due to higher
nonspecific binding in the pancreas than in the renal cortex.
further studies are warranted to address this possible
overestimation of vmat2 binding in the pancreas.
