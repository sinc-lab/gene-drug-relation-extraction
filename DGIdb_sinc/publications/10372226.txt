summary.  xxxd2638xxx  is a novel calcium channel blocker
with activity at both l-type and t-type calcium channels.
there are data suggesting that this compound can protect
the ischemic/reperfused myocardium in spite of the fact that
there is a very low abundance of t-type calcium channels
within ventricular tissue. the aims of this study were twofold. first, we wished to study the protective effect of  xxxd2638xxx  on ischemia/reperfusion injury in the isolated rat
heart using infarct size as the endpoint of injury. in this respect, we compared  xxxd2638xxx  with amlodipine, a wellknown and potent l-type calcium channel blocker, and with
ischemic preconditioning, an intervention known to reduce
infarct size consistently. secondly, we investigated the possible mechanisms through which protection was achieved. for
this second purpose, we examined the effects on protection
of  xxxd2215xxx  (an atp-dependent kⴙ channel blocker)
and chelerythrine (a protein kinase c inhibitor). isolated rat
hearts were perfused in the langendorff mode at constant
pressure. control,  xxxd2638xxx -treated (0.3 lm),  xxxd2638xxx 
plus  xxxd2215xxx  (50lm), and  xxxd2638xxx  plus chelerythrine (10 lm) treated hearts underwent 35 minutes regional ischemia followed by 120 minutes reperfusion. at the
end of the experiments, infarct size was determined with
triphenyltetrazolium chloride and was expressed as a percentage of the ischemic risk zone (i/r %). a signi~cant reduction in infarct size with  xxxd2638xxx  treatment was observed (i/r 11.1 ⴞ 2.1% vs. 35.5 ⴞ 3.1% in controls). this was
comparable with the infarct reduction seen with two 5-minute cycles of ischemic preconditioning (17.7 ⴞ 2.5%). amlodipine 0.1 lm, a concentration that caused equivalent
coronary vasodilatation as that produced by  xxxd2638xxx 
treatment, had no signi~cant effect on infarct size (i/r 29.7
ⴞ 3.5%). the protective effect of  xxxd2638xxx  was not signi~cantly modi~ed by the presence of the pkc inhibitor chelerythrine 10 lm (i/r 19.1 ⴞ 4.9%) but was abolished when
 xxxd2215xxx  50 lm was coadministered with  xxxd2638xxx 
prior to ischemia (i/r 28.1 ⴞ 4.7%). neither chlelerythrine
nor  xxxd2215xxx  alone had any in_uence on infarct size. we
conclude from these data that  xxxd2638xxx , unlike amlodipine,
markedly reduces infarct size in the rat isolated heart. this
protection is sensitive to inhibition by  xxxd2215xxx , suggesting that  xxxg1253xxx  opening may be an important additional and novel mechanism of  xxxd2638xxx ’s action.

calcium channel blockers form a heterogeneous group
of drugs. however, they have a common effect, namely,
the inhibition of calcium entry into cells through voltage-gated channels. consequently, they can affect diverse physiological processes. there are three different types of calcium channels: l-, n-, and t-type [1],
but only l- and t- type have been identi~ed in the
cardiovascular system. theoretically, it is feasible that
blocking calcium entry should limit the metabolic requirements of cells and also reduce intracellular calcium overload during ischemia-reperfusion, thereby
providing a protective effect under these conditions
[2]. bene~cial effects have been shown in a wide variety of experimental models. for example, in dogs [3],
cats [4], pigs [5], and rats [6] it has been demonstrated
that the l-type calcium channel blockers diltiazem,
amlodipine, verapamil, and  xxxd2092xxx  protected the
myocardium against irreversible injury as a result of
ischemia-reperfusion. however, in all cases, the limitation of injury could not be dissociated from marked
reductions in heart rate and/or contractility, and thus a
direct cytoprotective action, independent of hemodynamic actions, remains unproven. in humans, the use of
l-type calcium channel blockers in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion has yielded con_icting results.
where as in some studies different l-type calcium
channel blockers have not shown a bene~cial effect on
patient survival [7,8], others found that treatment with
long-acting calcium channel blockers at the onset of
acute myocardial infarction reduced infarct size as estimated from peak creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase [9]. additionally, the clinical use of l-type
calcium channel blockers in infarcting myocardium has
proved controversial because of marked hemodynamic
actions.
 xxxd2638xxx  is a prototype compound that blocks both
t-type and l-type calcium channels. it blocks t-type

calcium channel currents at a lower concentration than
that needed to inhibit l-type channels [10]. as such it
is a valuable pharmacological tool, although it is not
licenced for clinical use. its action in vitro is characterized by the absence of negative inotropic effects at
low concentrations [10]. there are some reports documenting the ability of the compound to limit infarct size
during coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion in
dog [11] and rat [12], and this protection is unrelated to
reductions in myocardial contractility or to changes in
coronary blood _ow. the apparent direct cytoprotective effect of the agent is unexpected because t-type
calcium channels are present in only very low numbers
in normal ventricular tissue. furthermore, although
the agent clearly exhibits l-type channel blocking activity, extensive experience with l-type blockers predicts that they do not limit infarct size directly but only
do so as a result of negative inotropic and/or chronotropic actions.
the aims of our study were to further investigate
the reputed cardioprotective effect of  xxxd2638xxx  in the
rat isolated heart using infarct size as the experimental
endpoint. we compared the effect of  xxxd2638xxx  with a
well-established l-type calcium channels blocker, amlodipine. we also compared the reduction in infarct size
due to  xxxd2638xxx  treatment with ischemic preconditioning. in our experience, ischemic preconditioning
represents the most robust protective intervention
that we have studied and serves as an excellent positive control in infarct limitation studies such as the
present one. we found  xxxd2638xxx  to be markedly protective in this model, and so we went on to identify the
possible mechanisms through which this protection
was achieved. we were aware that activation of the
intracellular signaling intermediate protein kinase c
(pkc) and opening of atp-dependent k⫹ (katp) channels are two mechanisms strongly implicated in the
protective action of ischemic preconditioning, and so
we examined if the cardioprotective effect of  xxxd2638xxx  was achieved through either of these mechanisms.

methods
animals
male sprague-dawley rats (300–350 g body weight)
were used. all animals were obtained from the same
supplier, fed a standard pelleted diet with free access
to water, housed under the same conditions, and received humane care in accordance with the guidelines
on the operation of the animals (scienti~c procedures) act 1986, published by her majesty’s stationery of~ce (london, uk).

materials
 xxxd2638xxx  was the gift of roche pharmaceuticals (welwyn garden city, herts, uk). amlodipine was a gift
from professor gerd heusch, essen, germany.  xxxd2215xxx -

clamide, triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and chelerythrine were from sigma (poole, dorset, uk). zinccadmium sul~de microspheres (1–10 lm) were from
duke scienti~c through brookhaven instruments
(uk).

heart perfusion
the animals were anesthetized by ip administration of
sodium pentobarbital (55 mg/kg) and were given heparin (300 iu). the hearts were excised, placed in chilled
buffer solution, and within 1 minute were mounted on
a constant-pressure (80 mmhg) langendorff perfusion
apparatus. they were perfused retrogradely through
the ascending aorta with a modi~ed krebs-henseleit
(kh) bicarbonate buffer containing (in mm): nacl
118.5, nahco3 25, kcl 4.8,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, kh2po4 1.2,
cacl2 1.7, and glucose 12. all solutions were ~ltered
through a watman micro~ber ~lter (2.0 lm pore),
gassed with 95%o2 / 5% co2, and maintained at 37⬚c
with the help of water-heated double-jacket chambers.
all hearts were electrically paced via the right atrium
at 300 beats/min throughout the experiments. the
temperature was permanently monitored by a thermocouple inserted into the right ventricle. the ph of the
perfusate was ascertained with a blood gas analyzer
(avl type 993, avl instruments, stone, staffs, uk)
and adjusted as necessary to maintain ph close to 7.4
(⫾ 0.05) by modifying the gas output. a latex isovolumic balloon was introduced into the left ventricle
through an insertion in the left atrial appendage and
in_ated to give a preload of 8–10 mmhg. the balloon
catheter was attached by a pressure transducer to a
chart recorder (lectromed, welwyn garden city, uk).
left ventricular developed pressure, heart rate, and
coronary _ow were registered at regular intervals.
a 4/0 silk suture on a round-bodied surgical needle
(mersilk type w546, ethicon, edinburgh, uk) was
passed under the left main coronary artery, and the
ends of the suture were passed through a small plastic
tube to form a snare. regional ischemia was induced by
tightening the snare and clamping in place with hemostat forceps. reperfusion was instituted by releasing
the ends of the suture.

treatment protocols
hearts were assigned to one of eight experimental
groups. group 1. control (c, n ⫽ 10): hearts were
allowed to stabilize. they then, underwent 35 minutes
regional ischemia followed by 120 minutes reperfusion.
group 2. ischemic preconditioning (ipc, n ⫽ 9): the
ischemic preconditioning protocol consisted of two 5minute coronary occlusions, separated by 5-minute
reperfusion intervals prior to the 35-minutes ischemia.
group 3.  xxxd2638xxx  treated (m group, n ⫽ 8):  xxxd2638xxx  0.3 lm was perfused for 15 minutes prior to
coronary occlusion. group 4. amlodipine treated (a
group, n ⫽ 6): amlodipine 0.1 lm was perfused for 15
minutes prior to coronary occlusion as in group 3.

in all groups, the administration of any drug ceased
immediately after ischemia was induced by switching
the perfusate to the normal kh buffer. the experimental protocols are presented graphically in figure 1.

infarct size measurement
at the end of the reperfusion period, the snare was
tightened to reocclude the branch of the coronary artery, and zinc cadmium sul~de _uorescent particles
suspended in saline were infused slowly via the aorta.
this delineated the ischemic zone of the myocardium
as a non_uorescing area under uv light. after freezing for 1–4 hours at ⫺20⬚c, hearts were sliced into
1-mm thick transverse sections from apex to the base
and incubated in triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution (1% in phosphate buffer, ph 7.4) at 37⬚c for 10–12
minutes. the tissue slices were then ~xed in 10% formalin for 6–24 hours. at the end of this period, infarction was clearly delineated: the viable tissue was
stained red and the infarcted tissue appeared pale. the
slices were drawn on acetate sheets in normal light
and then under uv light so that three regions could be
distinguished: nonrisk tissue, viable tissue at risk, and
infarcted tissue within the risk zone. using a computed drawing technique (summa sketch ii, summagraphics, ct, usa), planimetry was performed on the
heart slices and the percentage of the infarcted tissue
within the volume of the myocardium at risk was calculated.

statistical analysis
all values are expressed as mean ⫾ se. infarct size

exclusions
a total of 66 hearts were used for these studies. ten
hearts were excluded for technical reasons: two hearts
failed to pace throughout the experiment, four hearts
had unphysiological left ventricular developed pres-

instituting perfusion. thus we report data for 56 successfully completed experiments.

experimental procedure. both  xxxd2638xxx  and amlodipine increased coronary _ow rate, and the vasodilator
effects of these drugs were sustained throughout the
ischemia–reperfusion protocol, although drug perfusion ceased immediately after coronary artery occlusion. interestingly, the vasoldilator effects of  xxxd2638xxx  were not seen when the drug was coperfused
with either chelerythrine or  xxxd2215xxx .
during ischemia, left ventricular contractility decreased to a similar extent in all groups. figure 3 sum-

infarct size in control hearts was 35.5 ⫾ 3.1%, a value
consistent with our previous experience in this experimental model [13] and similar to that reported by other
groups [14].  xxxd2638xxx  0.3 lm treatment prior to ischemia reduced infarct size very markedly (11.1 ⫾

was comparable with that seen with two 5-minutes
ischemic preconditioning cycles (17.7 ⫾ 2.5%, p ⬍ 0.01

the other hand, pkc inhibition with chelerythrine 10

discussion
the results of these studies may be summarized as
follows:
1.  xxxd2638xxx  and amlodipine induced equipotent
coronary vasodilation, but only  xxxd2638xxx  limited
infarct size.
2. the infarct-limiting effects of  xxxd2638xxx  were not
apparently related to decreased myocardial contractility.
3. the vasodilator effects of  xxxd2638xxx  were attenuated by coadministration of either a pkc inhibitor,
chelerythrine, or a  xxxg1253xxx  blocker,  xxxd2215xxx .
4. the infarct-limiting effects of  xxxd2638xxx  were
abolished by  xxxd2215xxx  but not by chelerythrine.

in the present study we have examined infarction in
the rat isolated heart, which has been established as an
excellent experimental model for studying the direct
cardioprotective effects of a variety of interventions
[13,14]. our aims were to verify the previously reported in vivo protective effect of  xxxd2638xxx  and to
elucidate possible mechanisms through which this protection was achieved. prior to this work, the effect of
 xxxd2638xxx  on infarct size was studied in two in vivo
animal models, namely, dog [11] and rat [12]. data obtained by vander heide et al. [11] suggested that the
infarct-limiting effect of  xxxd2638xxx  in dogs was comparable with that induced by verapamil. however, although in that study  xxxd2638xxx  induced limitation of
infarct size, the protective effect was comparatively
modest and not as effective as that induced by ischemic
preconditioning. both  xxxd2638xxx  and verapamil were
administered before, during, and after coronary occlusion. although during preischemic stabilization there
were no signi~cant hemodynamic differences among
the groups, heart rate and diastolic blood pressure
were signi~cantly reduced in the drug-treated groups,
and the verapamil group had to be paced in order to
overcome a dramatic decrease in heart rate. (in another study, also performed in the canine in vivo but
not involving infarct determination [15], it was shown
that both  xxxd2638xxx  and amlodipine improved myocardial contractility following a brief (2 minute) critical
coronary stenosis. the authors concluded that this effect was not due to blockade of t channels.) richard et
al. [12], using a model of coronary artery occlusion in
the anesthetized rat showed that both  xxxd2638xxx  and
verapamil induced comparable limitation of infarct
size, although the hemodynamic alterations were less
marked in the  xxxd2638xxx -treated animals.
the results of the present study show that  xxxd2638xxx  induced a signi~cant decrease of infarct size in
the rat isolated heart. the hearts were paced so that
the effects of any reduction in heart rate were obviated. this protective effect of the drug was not accompanied by signi~cant attenuation of left ventricular developed pressure compared with control values.
moreover, in this model the reduction in infarct size
caused by  xxxd2638xxx  administration was slightly
greater than that observed following ischemic preconditioning. in contrast, the l-type calcium channel
blocker amlodipine effected no protection against ischemic injury when employed at a concentration that
produced equipotent coronary vasodilatation.
the possible underlying mechanism(s) of  xxxd2638xxx ’s protective effects on the ischemic myocardium
was examined were in these studies. previous explanations for the infarct-limiting effect of  xxxd2638xxx  have
included a reduction of myocardial contractility [16],
the selective effect of the agent on t-type calcium
channels [17], and coronary vasodilatation [18]. heart
rate was maintained constant in our experimental protocols, and there was no evidence of reduced left ventricular developed pressure in the  xxxd2638xxx -treated

 xxxd2638xxx  and katp

group. a protective action of  xxxd2638xxx  linked to its
selective action on t-type channels does not seem feasible because it has been shown that these channels
have very low abundance in left ventricular myocytes
[19]. the in_uence of coronary vasodilatation on infarct
size in this model is questionable. both  xxxd2638xxx  and
amlodipine are potent vasodilators, but despite similar
increases in coronary vascular _ow, only  xxxd2638xxx 
treatment signi~cantly affected infarct limitation.
all of the previous considerations point towards a
more novel cellular mechanism of cytoprotection. we
were impressed by the magnitude of protection afforded by  xxxd2638xxx  in our hands, which was as potent
as ischemic preconditioning. there is a convincing body
of experimental evidence that the protective effects of
ischemic preconditioning are related to opening of the
 xxxg1253xxx .  xxxg1253xxx  openers are potent antiischemic agents, and the  xxxg1253xxx  associated with
cardioprotection appears to be that residing in the mitochondrial inner membrane and not the sarcolemmal
channel [20,21].  xxxd2215xxx  and sodium 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-hd) are inhibitors of the mitochondrial
 xxxg1253xxx , although  xxxd2215xxx  is unselective
and also inhibits sarcolemmal katp. we hypothesized
that the marked infarct-limiting effect of  xxxd2638xxx 
might be related to a hitherto unreported ability of the
drug to open katp channels. preliminary studies with
the mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx  blocker 5-hd were
abandoned due to chemical incompatibility of 5-hd and
 xxxd2638xxx  in krebs-henseleit buffer. however, our
studies with the sarcolemmal and mitochondrial katp
channel blocker  xxxd2215xxx  showed that the protective effects of  xxxd2638xxx  were abolished in the presence of  xxxd2215xxx . however, although the activity
of katp channels is known to be at least partially regulated by pkc activity, the pkc inhibitor chelerythrine
did not modify the infarct-limiting effects of  xxxd2638xxx .
our observations of the effects of  xxxd2638xxx  in the
presence and absence of  xxxd2215xxx  and chelerythrine point to a fundamental dissociation between
the vascular and the cytoprotective actions of  xxxd2638xxx .  xxxd2638xxx  induced a marked increase in coronary _ow. the concomitant administration of  xxxd2638xxx  with either  xxxd2215xxx  or chelerythrine
blunted the vasodilator action and reduced the coronary _ow to control levels. this is surprising, because
the vasodilator action of  xxxd2638xxx  was presumed to be
caused by l-type calcium channel blockade. a katp
channel blocker would not be expected to block this
effect. nevertheless, irrespective of the effects on
coronary _ow reported earlier,  xxxd2215xxx  and chelerythrine had opposing effects on the infarct-limiting
ability of  xxxd2638xxx , namely, only  xxxd2215xxx  abolished the protective effect of  xxxd2638xxx .
the sensitivities of the vascular and cardioprotective actions of  xxxd2638xxx  to inhibition by  xxxd2215xxx 
are novel. a vasodilator effect inhibited by  xxxd2215xxx  suggests, but does not con~rm, an action involving sarcolemmal  xxxg1253xxx  opening. an infarct-

121

limiting effect sensitive to inhibition by  xxxd2215xxx 
similarly suggests a katp-dependent mechanism, but
other experimental evidence suggests that this effect
is mediated by mitochondial rather than sarcolemmal
 xxxg1253xxx  opening. these data point to two actions
of  xxxd2638xxx  that are sensitive to inhibition by  xxxd2215xxx , namely, vasodilatation and cardioprotection,
but these two actions appear to be dissociated. we
conclude that  xxxd2638xxx  has cardioprotective actions
that may be unrelated to its ability to block l- and
t-type calcium channels but that may be related to
 xxxd2215xxx -sensitive properties, hitherto unrecognized.
