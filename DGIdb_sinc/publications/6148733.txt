selectivity of  xxxd329xxx  hydrochloride, a
b1-adrenoceptor antagonist, in asthmatic patients
claes-gbran lbfdahl, m.d., karin svedmyr, m.d., and nils svedmyr, m.d.
 xxxd329xxx  hydrochloride. a new l3-adrenoceptor antagonist. has been shown to be cardioselective in
animals. to evaluate its selectivity in humans. a double-blind. crossover study was conducted in 8
asthmatics. following a single oral dose of placebo.  xxxd329xxx  75 or 150 mg or propranolol hydrochloride 40 mg. forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev,). heart rate. blood pressure and skeletal muscle
tremor were measured before and after 4 increasing intravenous doses of terbutaline sulfate to establish
terbutaline dose-reponse curves. the fev, decreased after all active treatments. during terbutaline
infusions there was an increase in fev, after both  xxxd329xxx  doses and placebo. the terbutaline doseresponse curve after  xxxd329xxx  shifted to the right. however. after propranolol. there was no increase in
fev, during terbutaline stimulation. heart rate and skeletal muscle tremor showed a similar pattern
during the experiment. in dosages that have previously been shown to produce at least the same degree
of blockade of exercise-induced tachycardia.  xxxd329xxx  has less influence on terbutaline-induced bronchodilation. heart rate increase and skeletal muscle tremor than did propranolol. thus  xxxd329xxx  has
relative 13,-adrenoceptor antagonist selectivity. drawing upon the results of a previous study in the same
patients. we believe  xxxd329xxx . atenolol and metoprolol have similar 13,-selectivity.

beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are widely used in
the treatment of angina pectoris, hypertension and
cardiac arrhythmias. for these indications, their effect is mainly mediated by way of 13,-adrenoceptors,
according to the classification by lands and co-workers described in 1967.'·2 bronchoconstriction occurs
in asthmatic patients when they are treated with a
nonselective l3-antagonist because bronchodilating
13 2-adrenoceptors are also blocked.3-5 furthermore,
recovery after hypoglycemia in diabetics is hampered when 13 2-adrenoceptors are blocked. 6 therefore the use of 13,-selective antagonists has an advantage in clinical practice.
various methods have been used to study the selectivity of l3-adrenoceptor antagonists. 3 . 7 we studied the interaction between l3-adrenoceptor agonists
and antagonists in asthmatic patients to establish the
shift of the 132-adrenoceptor agonist dose-response
curves. we compared the effects on ventilatory capacity, cardiovascular variables and skeletal muscle
tremor of a new selective 13,-adrenoceptor antagonist,  xxxd329xxx  hydrochloride, with those of propranolol hydrochloride (inderal r) at doses that gave the
same reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia (75

mg vs 40 mg, respectivey).8 9 our aims were (1) to
evaluate the selectivity of  xxxd329xxx  for 13,-adrenoceptors compared with propranolol and (2) to compare the 13,-selectivity of  xxxd329xxx  with that of aten0101 ( xxxd240xxx  r). and metoprolol ( xxxd2629xxx  r) using
data from an earlier study in the same patients performed within 2 weeks of this study. 10
methods

experimental design
the study was a double-blind, randomized, crossover comparison of  xxxd329xxx  with propranolol in
stable, intrinsic asthmatics. the patients received a
single dose of placebo, 75 or 150 mg of  xxxd329xxx ,
or 40 mg of propranolol orally every other day. each
treatment was followed by 4 increasing doses of terbutaline sulfate given intravenously. the experiment
was concluded each day by inhalation of terbutaline
from a metered aerosol. the 2-day interval between
treatments was long enough to prevent any carryover effect because all of the drugs used in the
study have short half-lives."
the study was approved by the ethical committee
of the university of gbteborg, sweden.

between treatment days was above 15%, the experiment was repeated. in 1 patient, the treatment order
was changed due to variation in basal value.
patients' previous drug treatments are shown in
table 1. during the study, 132-adrenoceptor agonists
were withdrawn 12 hours before each treatment.
theophylline therapy was stopped 36 hours before
the trial. patients taking steroids continued therapy
unchanged during the study.
experimental details
the patients arrived at the laboratory  xxxd2274xxx :30 a.m.
after a light breakfast without coffee or tea. an intravenous catheter was inserted in a superficial vein of
the arm. patients rested comfortably in a semirecumbent position throughout the experiment and for 60
minutes before basal measurements were performed. the following measurements were made in
order: heart rate from a continuous electrocardiogram (ecg) recording, blood pressure by the cuff
method and skeletal muscle tremor with a singleplane accelerometer according to a method described earlier. 12 tremor was expressed as a ratio,
where recorded values after treatment were divided
by the basal value each day in each patient. patients
taking 132-adrenoceptor agonists experienced tremor
at a mean remor ratio of 1.7. 12 fev 1 was measured
with a bernstein spirometer; 2 recordings were made
and the higher value was used for calculations.
after basal measurements were taken, placebo,
75 mg of  xxxd329xxx , 150 mg of  xxxd329xxx  or 40 mg
of propranolol was given in double-blind, randomized order in the form of 2 tablets on each of 4 test
days. sixty and 100 minutes later, all of the measurements were repeated.
terbutaline was given intravenously in four increasing doses at 30-minute intervals starting at 120
minutes after the administration of the l3-adrenoceptor antagonist. the amounts given were 0.036,
0.117,0.375 and 1.23 /-tg/kg/min, each infused over
a 6-minute period. all measurements were repeated
7 to 10 minutes after the start of each infusion.
thirty minutes after the last terbutaline infusion,

the patients inhaled 6 puffs of terbutaline 1.5 mg from
a metered aerosol (bricanylii), draco), and 5 minutes
later, all of the measurements were repeated. inhalations were carefully supervised.
statistical methods
results are shown as means ± standard error of
the mean (sem). two-way analysis of variance was
used to test whether fev 1 basal values differed significantly among treatments. the overall differences
were also tested in the same manner. if there were
significant overall differences, comparisons among
class means were performed according to snedecor
and cochran.13 assessment of statistical significance was based on the conventional levels (p <
0.05, < 0.01 and < 0.001).
the estimation of differences 60 and 100 minutes
after tablet intake was based on the mean of the 2
measurements. changes in fev 1 were calculated
from the mean basal value of the 4 test days.4.14
estimation of differences during the terbutaline
dose-response experiment was based on the mean
individual value of the effect from the 4 doses, thereby decreasing the measurement variation.
no statistical calculation was performed in the
comparison with data from another study.10 in the
latter comparison, fev 1 values were presented as
change from basal value each test day.

minutes after tablet intake.
in the terbutaline dose-response curve, there was
a dose-dependent increase in fev, after placebo
and  xxxd329xxx  treatment, and the variation was
treatment dependent (p < 0.01). the difference between placebo and  xxxd329xxx  75 mg was not significant; however, p was less than 0.1. between placebo and  xxxd329xxx  150 mg, the difference was 11.0
± 4.5% (p < 0.05). between propranolol and  xxxd329xxx  75 mg and between propranolol and  xxxd329xxx 
150 mg the differences (14.0 ± 4.5% and 11.5 ±
4.5%, respectively) were significant (p < 0.01 and p
< 0.05, respectively).
after terbutaline inhalation, there was a treatmentdependent variation (p < 0.01). no significant differences between placebo and either doses of bevanto101 were found. the differences between propranolol
and the two doses of  xxxd329xxx  were highly significant (p < 0.001), however.
individual data show that 3 patients had a decrease in at least one measurement of fev, of more
than 15% from mean basal value after 75 mg of
 xxxd329xxx , 4 patients after 150 mg of  xxxd329xxx  and
3 patients after 40 mg of propranolol. after placebo, 1
patient had a 15% decrease in one measurement. in
these patients, terbutaline produced an increase of
23-38% after  xxxd329xxx  treatments. after proprano101,2 of these did not return to their basal value after
maximal stimulation. one patient had a value of 7%
over his basal value after propranolol and terebutaline stimulation.

figure 2 shows the effects on heart rate. sixty and
100 minutes after the tablets were administered,
there were no significant differences among the
treatments. there was a tendency, however, toward
a lower heart rate after all of the active treatments.
after the last terbutaline dose, the treatment-dependent variation was highly significant (p < 0.001).
the difference between placebo and  xxxd329xxx  75
mg was not significant (7.6 ± 3.7 beats per minute
(bpm), p < 0.1). between placebo and bevantol150
mg the difference was 16.4 ± 3.7 bpm (p < 0.05).
the difference between propranolol and  xxxd329xxx 
75 mg was 27.9 ± 3.7 (p < 0.001) and between
propranolol and  xxxd329xxx  150 mg 18.1 ± 3.7 (p <
0.001).
blood pressure

there were no significant differences in basal systolic and diastolic blood pressure values measured
on different treatment days. the percentage of
change from basal value after the fourth dose of
terbutaline is shown in figure 3. there was less of an
increase in systolic blood pressure after the 3 active
treatments than after placebo. the decrease in diastolic pressure was similar after placebo and bevantolol75 mg and minimal after bevantolol150 mg, and
there was little' or no change after propranolol.
skeletal muscle effects
sixty and 100 minutes after tablet intake, there
was a treatment-dependent variation in tremor ratio
(p < 0.01). the effects of treatment are shown in
figure 4. the differences between placebo and both
 xxxd329xxx  doses were significant (p < 0.05 and <
0.001, respectively). there were no differences between  xxxd329xxx  and propranolol. after the fourth
dose of terbutaline, the difference among treatments
was highly significant (p < 0.001). the difference
between either dose of  xxxd329xxx  and placebo was
significant (p < 0.05 and < 0.01, respectively), as it
was between propranolol and each  xxxd329xxx  treatment (p < 0.01 and < 0.01, respectively).
comparison of  xxxd329xxx  with atenolol and
metoprolol
figure 5 shows the results of treatment with placebo,  xxxd329xxx  150 mg and propranolol together with
the results of another studylo in the same patients
using atenolol1 00 mg and metoprolol1 00 mg. at the
doses given, atenolol,  xxxd329xxx  and metoprolol
produced a very similar effects on fev" heart rate
and tremor ratio.

suits of a previous study in the same patients, we
believe  xxxd329xxx  is similar to atenolol and metopro101 in ~1-adrenoceptor selectivity.
we compared two doses of  xxxd329xxx  with propranolol, a nonselective ~-adrenoceptor antagonist,
in asthmatic patients whose disease was reversible.
we used a protocol appropriate for the study of ~­
adrenoceptor selectivity? and similar to that used in
earlier investigations in this laboratory.15. 16 thus this
study could answer the theoretically important question of selectivity in a group of patients who could
benefit from a drug with increased selectivity.
equality of effect on ~1-adrenoceptors is a prerequisite for the study of the selectivity of ~-adrenocep­
tor antagonists,? and the best measurement of equivalence is exercise-induced tachycardiay earlier
studies in healthy subjects showed that 150 mg of
 xxxd329xxx  has about the same effect as 80 mg of
propranolol, and that 75 mg of  xxxd329xxx  about the
same effect as 40 mg of propranolol. b thus the
doses of  xxxd329xxx  used in this study were at least
as effective on ~1-adrenoceptors as the dose of propranolol. since the pharmacokinetics of the two
drugs are similar, this variable probably did not influence the results. 11
this study showed differences between bevanto101 75 mg and propranolol 40 mg in their effect on
terbutaline-induced tachycardia. even 150 mg of  xxxd329xxx  had less influence on terbutaline-stimulated
tachycardia than did 40 mg of propranolol, as shown
after the highest dose of terbutaline. terbutaline-induced tachycardia is a ~2-mediated effect either indirectly on the peripheral vessels by way of decreased

vagal activity or through increased sympathetic
nerve activity, or directly on the chronotropic ~2adrenoceptors in the heart.1b-2o thus we found less
blockade of ~2-adrenoceptors by  xxxd329xxx  than by
propranolol. compared with placebo, however, 150
mg of  xxxd329xxx  had a greater blocking effect on
terbutaline-induced tachycardia. this can be explained either by blockade of the ~1-adrenoceptor­
mediated part of the reflex tachycardia or by the fact
that  xxxd329xxx  has a small blocking effect on ~2adrenoceptors. in summary, terbutaline-induced
changes in heart rate show that  xxxd329xxx  has less
effect on ~2-adrenoceptors than propranolol in doses
that are equipotent in blocking ~1-adrenoceptor-me­
diated effects.
skeletal muscle tremor is a ~2-adrenoceptor-me­
diated effecf.2 1. 22 furthermore, it is the dominant side
effect of ~2-adrenoceptor agonist therapy in asthmatic patients. 23 therefore it is important to note that
skeletal muscle tremor shows a pattern that is similar
to heart rate changes in these experiments. all of the
active ~-adrenoceptor antagonists initially produced
a reduction in tremor ratio that was statistically different from placebo. after  xxxd329xxx , however, terbutaline infusion effected a dose-dependent increase in
tremor. the dose-response curve shifted to the right,
showing greater blocking of the terbutaline effect
with the highest dosage of  xxxd329xxx . after propranolol, the terbutaline effect was totally blocked; maybe

there was a threshold effect after the last dose of
terbutaline. thus tremor measurements showed that
 xxxd329xxx  has less influence on 132-adrenoceptors
than does propranolol.
ventilatory capacity measured by fev, also
showed the same selectivity as heart rate and tremor
measurements. the effect on fev, after intake of
 xxxd329xxx  and propranolol as well as after atenolol
and metoprololol in another study (figure 5) is 13 2adrenoceptor mediated. it has been argued that 13,adrenoceptors in the airways might influence bronchial tone in asthmatics because their ability to
mediate bronchorelaxation had been found in animals. 2h6 in clinical studies using 13,-selective antagonists and agonists, we found no evidence of a
13,-adrenoceptor-mediated bronchodilation in asthmatics,'4.27 and recent in vitro studies on human
bronchial muscle from trachea down to small subsegmental bronchi did not reveal any 13,-adrenoceptor-mediated bronchial muscle relaxation. s thus the
decrease of fev, after administration of l3-adrenoceptor antagonists is due to a 13 2-adrenoceptor
blockade even after administration of partially selective 13,-antagonists. this effect of selective drugs is
sufficient to give the same decrease in fev, as propranolol. the difference between drugs is shown
with administration of a 132-adrenoceptor agonist;
rather small doses of terbutaline produce bronchodilation after a 13,-selective antagonist such as  xxxd329xxx , but no bronchodilation after propranolol. thus it
appears that the baseline for a dose-response curve
for 132-mediated bronchodilation is achieved after
blockade with both selective and nonselective an-

tagonists. the starting point for terbutaline-induced
bronchodilation after placebo administration is higher than after the l3-adrenoceptor antagonists because of endogenous stimulation of 132-adrenoceptors in these patients. this stimulation also has an
effect on tremor; a baseline is achieved after treatment with both selective and nonselective antagonists. thus the resting bronchial tone is influenced by
13 2-mediated bronchodilation that the antagonist inhibits, and the effect of the antagonist is shown by a
rightward shift of the curve.
when compared with another technique measuring airway conductance in healthy subjects,8 similar
results were achieved. that technique had the advantage of also establishing a slope for propranolol.
our study tended to show an increase in fev, after
the last dose of terbutaline, indicating that the threshold was reached. this occurred at a dose of terbutaline that was about 30 times higher after propranolol
than after  xxxd329xxx . the same tendency was also
seen with heart rate and tremor measurements. this
corresponds well with an earlier study using inhaled
albuterol as the agonist. 8 thus our study as well as
an earlier one8 showed that  xxxd329xxx  is f3,-adreno-

ceptor selective.
this study together with our previously presented
data show that 100 mg of atenolol, 150 mg of  xxxd329xxx  and 100 mg of metoprolol have an equl effect on
~2-adrenoceptor-mediated variables (figure 5).
studies have shown that 100 mg of atenolol and 100
mg of metoprolol are equipotent in blocking exerciseinduced tachycardia 2 to 3 hours after drug administration. 22 . 28. 29 recently, this has been under debate30 ; however, that discussion does not take into
account the different half-lives of atenolol and metoprolol. furthermore, the latter data indeed support
the conclusion that during the first hours after drug
administration, the effect on exercise tachycardia
after 100 mg of atenolol is similar to that after 100 mg
of metoprolol. metoprolol at a dose of 100 mg is
equipotent to 80 mg of propranolol,31 and 150 mg of
 xxxd329xxx  is equipotent to 80 mg of propranolol. 8
thus the ~1-adrenoceptor effects of atenolol,  xxxd329xxx  and metoprolol in the doses given in figure 5
are equal. it appears that the three ~1-selective antagonists are equally selective.
the study indicates that ~1-selective as well as
nonselective ~-antagonists produce bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients. after selective blockade, however, an ordinary dose of a ~2-agonist dilates the bronchi, whereas after nonselective
blockade, this does not occur. thus the clinical implication is clear. if a ~-adrenoceptor antagonist is indicated in an asthmatic person, the most ~1-selective
agent should be used together with the most effective ~2-adrenoceptor agonist.
