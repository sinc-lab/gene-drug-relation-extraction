abstract
objective: to determine the effect of dose of gnrh agonist on the follicular environment in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (coh)
cycles. study design: twenty-eight ivf patients with normal ovarian function were divided into three groups: group i received gnrha
( xxxd2691xxx  acetate/ xxxd2691xxx ) intranasally at 200 mg daily, group ii received 400 mg daily until hcg injection, and group iii was given 400 mg
daily before the initiation of ovarian stimulation, then 200 mg daily before the day of hcg injection. serum estradiol, progesterone, and
leptin levels were measured on the day of hcg injection. after aspiration, expression of pregnancy-associated a-plasma protein (papp)-a
in the follicular fluid of dominant follicles (>20 mm) was determined by western blot analysis. results: no significant difference was noted
in serum estradiol, progesterone, and leptin levels. but intrafollicular papp-a expression was significantly higher in group ii compared to
other groups (p < 0:05). conclusion: the dose of gnrha may have an impact on the intrafollicular environment of dominant follicles in
coh cycles.

1. introduction
ovarian follicular development is a critical factor determining the success of an assisted reproductive technology
(art). the quality, as well as the number, of follicles is
known to be improved by gnrh agonist (gnrha) [1,2],
which is used in conjunction with gonadotropin in controlled
ovarian hyperstimulation (coh) patients, primarily to prevent preovulatory premature luteinization [3,4]. to reduce
the possible detrimental effects of gnrha and the economic
burden of patients, restriction on the dose of gnrha has
been considered. feldberg and others have shown that
employing reduced dose of gnrha has resulted in beneficial
in vitro fertilization (ivf) outcomes, in terms of increased
serum estradiol level and number of oocytes harvested, and

decreased cancellation rate [5–8]. after appropriate pituitary
desensitization, no evidence of premature lh surge was
noted with low dose gnrha [9,10]. despite such clinical
advantages, the impact of reduced dose of gnrha on
ovarian intrafollicular physiology remains unclear.
recently, much attention has been drawn on pregnancyassociated a-plasma protein-a (papp-a) known to be found
highly in the serum of pregnant women. papp-a, a member
of metalloproteinase family, has been shown to degrade
 xxxg1149xxx , an inhibitor of igf-mediated fsh activity, thus
indirectly enhancing fsh action on the ovary [11]. this
identification of papp-a as the protease of  xxxg1149xxx  [12]
has compelled many scientists to believe papp-a to be a
critical determinant of fsh-induced folliculogenesis and a
potential marker reflecting a positive effect on the follicular
environment [13–15].
the aim of our study was to determine whether different doses of gnrha have any effects on the follicular

ria kit (coat-a-count, diagnostic products corp. ca,
usa). leptin was measured using a ria kit (linco
research inc., mo, usa).

2. materials and methods
2.4. western blot
2.1. patients
twenty-eight women with regular menstrual cycle and
normal basal serum fsh, lh, e2 levels undergoing coh for
ivf in the infertility clinic, department of ob/gy, samsung
medical center, seoul, korea, from february to november of
2001 were recruited in the order of enrollment. all patients
were aged 35 or below with body mass index (bmi) under
30 kg/m2. this study was approved by the ethical committee
of samsung medical center and informed consents were
obtained from all patients.
2.2. protocols
all eligible 28 patients were given monophasic oral pill
( xxxd2054xxx , organon, oss, the netherlands) from menstrual
day 1 or 2 for 2 weeks before commencing gnrha. all
patients received a daily intranasal spray of gnrha ( xxxd2691xxx  acetate,  xxxd2691xxx , searle & co., chicago) after completion of oral pill. gnrha at a daily dose of 200 mg was
administered intranasally in group i and 400 mg of gnrha
was given in group ii daily until the day of human chorionic
gonadotropin (hcg,  xxxd2228xxx , serono, uk) injection. group
iii patients received 400 mg of gnrha daily before the
starting day of fsh stimulation, then 200 mg daily until
the day of hcg injection.
ovarian stimulation with recombinant fsh (rec-fsh,
 xxxd2285xxx , organon, oss, the netherlands) was started in
all patients after confirming ovarian suppression (serum
estradiol, e2 < 50 pg/ml). rec-fsh at a daily dose of
200 iu was injected for 4–5 days, then the dose and
duration of rec-fsh were adjusted according to individual’s response based on e2 level and transvaginal follicle
monitoring.
when one or more follicles reached a mean diameter of
18 mm, 10,000 iu of hcg was administered intramuscularly. on the day of hcg injection, serum e2, progesterone
(p4), and leptin levels were measured.
oocyte retrieval under transvaginal ultrasound guidance
was done 36 h after hcg administration. after isolation of
oocytes, only follicular fluid aspirates of large follicles
(>20mm) were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at
600 g to compare the dominant follicles of similar development stage [16]. follicular fluids without red blood cells
(rbcs) were frozen at 70 8c.
2.3. hormone assays
serum e2 was measured using a commercially available
radioimmunoassay (ria) kit (e2-ria-ct, biosource,

total protein in the follicular fluid was obtained by
direct centricon (amicon, ym-10). equal amount of total
protein (30 mg) were separated by sds-page and the
transferred to supported western pvdf (schleicher &
schuell, new hampshire, usa) by applying 100 v for
2 h with a plate electrode apparatus (mini trans-blot
cell, usa). the blots were blocked for 2 h in tris-buffered
saline (tbst, 0.2 m nacl, 0.1% tween 20, 10 mm tris, ph
7.4) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. subsequently, the blots
were incubated with antibody against papp-a (1:1000;
zymed, 71–7000) in tbst. then the blots were also incubated with anti-rabbit igg (1:2500; amersham pharmacia
biotech, germany) or with anti-goat igg (1:5000; santa
cruz, usa) in tbst. the blots were washed several times
with tbst after each step. the bound antibody was detected
with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) system (amersham pharmacia biotech). the blots were stripped with
stripping buffer (100 mm b- xxxd26xxx , 2% (w/v)
 xxxd3215xxx , 62.5 mm tris–hcl, ph 6.7)
before applying b-actin antibody. the stripped blots were
incubated with antibody against b-actin used for the internal
standard (1:1000; sigma, usa) in the tbst followed by
anti-mouse igg (1:2500; amersham pharmacia biotech) in
tbst.
2.5. statistical analysis
the data was analyzed using the sas system. the differences of all parameters were statistically analyzed by
kruskal–wallis test. multiple tests by the least significant
difference test using ranks were applied to compare the
levels of papp-a expression between three groups in
pairs. p-value less than 0.05 was defined to be statistically
significant.

3. results
as shown in table 1, there were no significant differences
in the age, bmi, basal hormonal profile, and the distribution
of causes of infertility among three groups.
serum e2 level after gnrha administration and on the
day of hcg injection showed no significant difference
among three groups. there were no differences in
serum p4 and leptin levels on the day of hcg injection among three groups (table 2). but intrafollicular
papp-a level of dominant follicle was significantly higher
in group ii compared to that of the other groups (p < 0:05,
fig. 1).

4. discussion
our preliminary data suggest the possibility that the dose
of gnrha, specifically  xxxd2691xxx  acetate ( xxxd2691xxx ), may have
a significant effect on the expression of intrafollicular pappa. since the discovery of papp-a as the inhibitor of  xxxg1149xxx  by lawrence et al. [12], the role of papp-a in relation to
folliculogenesis has widely been explored [13–15,17–19].
high expression of papp-a in healthy, estrogen-active,
dominant follicles had strong implication on its active role
in the selection process of dominant follicles. in this study,
papp-a has been selected as a parameter to reflect the status
of follicle health in coh cycles under different doses of
gnrha administration.
administering gnrha in mid-luteal phase is commonly
practiced in coh cycle mainly to down-regulate pituitary
secretion of endogenous hormones, thus preventing premature luteinization and achieving follicular synchroniza-

tion [5,6]. according to the comparative trial by yuzpe
et al. [10], both 400 and 600 mg per day of gnrha
intranasal administrations have produced sufficient pituitary suppression and favorable reproductive outcomes.
other studies confer the efficiency of reduced dose of
gnrha on hypophyseal desensitization and retrieving
greater number of oocytes [6–8]. takeuchi et al. [9] have
demonstrated that reducing gnrha to half the standard
dose to 200 mg results in better ivf outcomes, in terms of
significantly more oocytes recovered, and significantly
greater number of oocytes available for et, and is more
beneficial in reducing side effects and costs. after complete pituitary desensitization with standard dose of
gnrha, no evidence of premature lh surge or reduced
quality of oocytes were noted after draw-back therapy of
gnrha.
to date, the molecular biological changes of follicular
environment depending on the doses of gnrha have not

68

been studied. according to our results, continuous administration of daily 400 mg of gnrha showed significantly
higher expression of intrafollicular papp-a of dominant
follicles compared to that of the other dose groups. despite
many advantages on the clinical results of coh, the role of
gnrha on folliculogenesis and its effect on intrafollicular
microenvironment remains controversial [20–22]. limited
in vivo models and currently available clinical data have
precluded scientists to draw any firm conclusion on the
effect of gnrha on ovarian physiology.
from the previous studies, reduced dose of gnrha
appears to improve ivf outcomes, but the status of follicular
health seems to be most superior from continuous administration of the standard dose (400 mg per day) of gnrha in
regards to the expression of papp-a. our study implies that
the role of gnrha in coh is not only limited to preventing
premature luteinization but may influence the quality of
follicle at the molecular biological level, and its dose may
have a significant effect on the growth of healthy follicles.
therefore, further prospective clinical trials are warranted to
seek the most optimal dose, which adapts to the intricate
balance between inducing an appropriate pituitary down
regulation with the most compatible follicular environment
and at the same time, preventing deleterious effects of
gnrha. this preliminary study suggests that the dose of
gnrha may have a significant effect on the intrafollicular
environment, reflected by the expression of papp-a.
