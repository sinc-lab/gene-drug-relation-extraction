the ligand binding domain of the nicotinic receptor has
served as a prototype for understanding ligand recognition in
members of the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion
channels. contained within the synaptic protrusion of these
receptors, the ligand-binding sites are formed at interfaces
between subunits. in the acetylcholine receptor (achr)1 found
at the motor end plate, the ␣ subunit forms one face of each
binding site, whereas a non-␣ subunit, ␥, ␦, or ⑀, forms the
opposing face (1). residues critical for ligand binding have been
identified by using subunit chimeras and point mutations com-

bined with measurements of binding of probes that interact
with structures in both subunits at the interface. these probes
helped establish the subunit interface structure of the ligand
binding domain and include curare and its derivatives (2, 3),
␣-conotoxins (4, 5), ␣-neurotoxins (6), and waglerins (7). the
recent x-ray structure of acetylcholine-binding protein
(achbp) elegantly confirmed the subunit interface structure of
the ligand binding domain (8).
curare and its derivatives competitively antagonize the
achr found at the motor end plate by occupying one of the two
ligand-binding sites (9, 10). curare binds more tightly to the
␣⫺⑀ than to the ␣⫺␦ site, and thus its functional antagonism at
tens of nanomolar concentrations results from occupancy of
this high affinity binding site. curariform antagonists contain
a rigid, cyclic hydrocarbon scaffold bearing two tetrahydroisoquinoline rings and two electron-deficient nitrogen atoms separated by about 9 å (11, 12). thus two appropriately spaced,
positively charged centers represent the minimal components
required in a high affinity competitive antagonist, also known
as the antagonist pharmacophore. at the core of the antagonist
pharmacophore concept is the idea that structurally related
antagonists block function by binding to the ␣⫺⑀ site in the
same orientation.
we therefore sought to determine whether different methylated derivatives of curare bind in the same orientation to the
human muscle achr, and we addressed this question using
mutagenesis, measurements of antagonist binding, and computational determinations of antagonist docking orientation.
we examined binding of d-tc and its fully methylated derivative  xxxd2625xxx  to achrs containing mutations of key residues
at the ligand-binding site. by using our previously described
structural model of the achr ligand binding domain, based on
lysine scanning and homology modeling (13), we used molecular dynamics simulation to generate multiple snapshots of the
binding site structure, and computed optimal docking orientations of antagonist for each snapshot. unexpectedly, both our
experimental and computational determinations of antagonist
binding reveal that d-tc and  xxxd2625xxx  bind in distinctly
different orientations to the adult human muscle achr. the
results have important consequences for the design of neuromuscular blocking agents and of drugs targeted against other
types of nicotinic receptors.

curariform alkaloids competitively inhibit muscle acetylcholine receptors (achr) by bridging the ␣ and
non-␣ subunits that form the ligand-binding site. here
we delineate bound orientations of d- xxxd3456xxx  (dtc) and its methylated derivative  xxxd2625xxx  using mutagenesis, ligand binding measurements, and computational methods. when tested against a series of lysine
mutations in the ⑀ subunit, the two antagonists show
marked differences in the consequences of the mutations on binding affinity. the mutations ⑀l117k, ⑀y111k,
and ⑀l109k decrease affinity of  xxxd2625xxx  by up to 3
orders of magnitude but only slightly alter affinity of
d-tc. at the ␣ subunit face of the binding site, the mutation ␣y198t decreases affinity of both antagonists, but
␣y198f preferentially enhances affinity of d-tc. computation of antagonist docking orientations, based on our
structural model of the ␣ⴚ⑀ site of the human achr,
indicates distinct orientations of each antagonist; the
flatter  xxxd2625xxx  fits into a pocket formed principally
by the ⑀ subunit, whereas the more compact d-tc spans
the narrower crevasse between ␣ and ⑀ subunits. the
side chains of ⑀tyr-111 and ⑀thr-117 juxtapose one of
two quaternary nitrogens in  xxxd2625xxx  but are remote
from the equivalent quaternary nitrogen in d-tc, which
instead closely approaches ␣tyr-198. the different
docked orientations arise through tilt of the curariform
scaffold by ⬃60o normal to the nitrogen-nitrogen axis,
together with a 20o rotation about the axis. the overall mutagenesis and computational results show that
despite their similar structures, d-tc and  xxxd2625xxx 
bind in distinctly different orientations to the adult
human achr.

docking and molecular dynamics simulation—to account for the
contribution of protein dynamics to ligand docking, we carried out a
1-ns molecular dynamics (md) simulation of our the structural model of
human achr (13) using the amber 7 program, which included the
parm 99 force field (27). the protein was solvated in a water box using
the tip3p model for water molecules, extended at least 10 å in each
direction from the protein (28,165 water molecules included), and 66
na⫹ and 16 cl⫺ counter ions were added to neutralize the system by
employing the leap module of amber 7. the entire system was first
energy-minimized by employing the sander module of amber 7 and
then gradually heated to 298 k using a 30-ps heating step; in these
computations the particle mesh ewald method was employed to calculate long range electrostatic interactions. following the heating step,
the system was maintained at 298 k, and the md simulation was
computed at 1-fs intervals with frames collected every 1 ps. because the
linker joining ␤⫺strands 8 and 9 in each subunit (8, 13) did not achieve
a single stable structure in preliminary md simulations, the protein
main chain atoms were constrained in space, but side chain atoms were
freely flexible. during the simulation, the shake algorithm was
turned on to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms, and the nonbonded interaction cut-off was set to 8.0 å. trajectories from the subsequent 1,000-ps md simulation were collected for docking computation. from each of the 1,000 frames of the dynamic achr structure,
atomic coordinates of the ␣ and ⑀ subunits were collected for docking
computation. partial charges were then assigned to each atom of the ␣
and ⑀ subunits using the restrained electrostatic potential (resp)
charge model, which is used in the application of the amber force field.
crystal structures of  xxxd2625xxx  (12) and d-tc (11) were used to
prepare the ligands for docking. hydrogen atoms were added by employing quanta, followed by a 500-step energy minimization of all the
hydrogen atoms using the charmm module in quanta. partial
charges were assigned to each atom of the ligand using the semiempirical charge model-1 (cm1) in the amsol 6.7.2 program (16) with
the following settings: the sm5.4pda solvation mode, the am1 semiempirical method, water as solvent, the “truste” optimizer, and
“charge” set to ⫹2 based on the net charge of both ligands.
docking computations were performed using the autodock 3.0.3
program. nonpolar hydrogens were removed from each ligand, and
their partial atomic charges were united with the bonded carbon atoms.
for each frame of the ␣⫺⑀ subunit pair, the ligand was arbitrarily
positioned at the subunit interface using quanta, and then docking
computations were performed using the lamarkian genetic algorithm
with grid sizes 40 ⫻ 40 ⴛ 40 (grid spacing 0.375 å), yielding 10 docked
conformations per frame. during the docking computation, free rotation
was allowed about bonds to hydroxyl or methyl groups of each curare
analog (fig. 1), but the remaining atoms were maintained in the coordinates of the crystal structures. parameters in autodock were

assigned default values. the resulting 10,000 docking orientations for
each ligand produced by autodock 3.0.3 were analyzed by grouping
them into clusters with similar ligand orientations. we employed a
cluster analysis that classified structures as similar in 1-å intervals of
the ligand root mean square deviation.
results

this study arose from the chance observation that a series of
lysine mutations in the human ⑀ subunit, previously used to
assess surface or buried orientations of residue side chains (13),
impaired binding of  xxxd2625xxx  much more than its structural
analog d-tc. the side chain of each mutated residue in this
series was shown to project on the protein surface, rather than
into the hydrophobic core, and to localize in loops e–g at the ⑀
subunit face of the ligand binding domain. we were also motivated by measurements of functional antagonism of mouse
achr showing different effects of mutations at ⑀59 on potency
of several curare analogs (29).
we co-expressed each lysine mutation with complementary
␣, ␤, and ␦ subunits in hek293 cells, and we determined
binding of d-tc and  xxxd2625xxx  to receptors on intact cells by
competition against the initial rate of ␣-bungarotoxin binding
(see “experimental procedures”). for each antagonist, occupancy of the adult human achr is well described by the sum of
two binding sites present in equal number, corresponding to
the ␣⫺⑀ and ␣⫺␦ subunit interfaces.  xxxd2625xxx  distinguishes
between the two binding sites to the greatest degree, exhibiting
a ratio of dissociation constants of 83, whereas for d-tc the
ratio is 15 (fig. 2 and table i). for the lysine mutations in
binding site loops e and f (loop e, ⑀w55k, ⑀g57k, and ⑀d59k;
loop f, ⑀l109k, ⑀y111k, and ⑀t117k), large reductions in
affinity are observed for  xxxd2625xxx , whereas much smaller
reductions are observed for d-tc; notably, the mutation
⑀t117k exhibits almost absolute selectivity between the two
antagonists. exceptions to these  xxxd2625xxx -selective mutations include the loop f mutation ⑀l119k and the loop g
mutations ⑀d173k and ⑀d175k, which diminish affinity of
both d-tc and  xxxd2625xxx . these findings show that the ⑀
subunit contributes to binding of  xxxd2625xxx  much more than
binding of d-tc.
each lysine mutation in this series increases the dissociation
constant of one of the two ligand binding sites, presumably the
␣⫺⑀ site, whereas the dissociation constant of the presumed
␣⫺␦ site is little changed (table i). this site selectivity is
evident from inspection of the log ratio of dissociation constants
of mutant to wild type receptors computed for each of the two

expression of mutant receptors and ligand binding measurements—hek cells were transfected with mutant or wild type achr
subunit cdnas using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (2).
in brief, 3 days after transfection, intact hek cells were harvested by
gentle agitation in phosphate-buffered saline plus 5 mm edta. ligand
binding to intact cells was measured by competition against the initial
rate of 125i-␣-bungarotoxin (␣-bgt) binding (15). after harvesting, the
cells were centrifuged, resuspended in high potassium ringer’s solution, and divided into aliquots for ligand binding measurements. potassium ringer’s solution contains the following: 140 mm kcl, 5.4 mm
nacl, 1.8 mm cacl2, 1.7 mm mgcl2, 25 mm hepes, 30 mg/liter bovine
 xxxg124xxx , adjusted to ph 7.4 with 10 –11 mm naoh. specified
concentrations of competing ligand were added prior to adding 125i-␣bgt, which was allowed to occupy approximately half of the surface
receptors. binding was terminated by adding potassium ringer’s solution containing 100 ␮m d- xxxd3456xxx  chloride. cells were filtered
through whatman gf-b filters using a brandel cell harvester and
washed with potassium ringer’s solution. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 3 mm acetylcholine. the total number of
125
i-␣-bgt-binding sites was determined by incubation with the toxin for
90 min. the initial rate of toxin binding was calculated as described (15)
to yield fractional ligand occupancy. competition measurements were
analyzed according to the sum of two binding sites present in equal
numbers as shown in equation 1,

binding sites; the ratio clearly deviates from zero for the affected site (dissociation constant k1) but is close to zero for the
other site (dissociation constant k2; see table i). perturbation
at only one of the two binding sites is expected because each
mutation is located in the ⑀ subunit, which contributes to the
␣⫺⑀ site, whereas the remaining ␣⫺␦ site contains no
mutation.
the results from lysine mutagenesis are combined with our
computational determinations of antagonist docking orientation, described below, to illustrate the  xxxd2625xxx  footprint at
the ⑀ subunit face of the binding site (fig. 3). highlighted in
space-filling rendering are side chains of key residues in the ⑀
subunit that, following mutation to lysine, markedly impair
binding of  xxxd2625xxx . the mutagenesis-generated footprint
reveals an elongated pocket in the ⑀ subunit that closely complements the concave hydrophobic face of the  xxxd2625xxx 
scaffold.
the large size and positive charge of the lysine side chain
make it a good probe of proximity to the positively charged
antagonist. lack of a mutational effect ensures that the ligand
does not bind at the site of the mutation, but a large effect does
not guarantee contact between the mutated residue and antagonist in the complex. we therefore examined the consequences
of conservative mutations of several residues in the ⑀ subunit,
and we found the best evidence for direct interaction for residues in loops f and g. the loop f mutation ⑀y111f markedly
enhances affinity for  xxxd2625xxx  but not that of d-tc, whereas
the loop g mutation ⑀d173a diminishes affinity of d-tc but not
that of  xxxd2625xxx  (table ii). the mutations ⑀t117y and
⑀t117a show only minor effects on binding of either antagonist,
indicating that polarity of the side chain at position ⑀117 is not
essential for binding. the overall results of conservative mutations in the ⑀ subunit indicate ⑀tyr-111 deep in the binding
pocket contributes to binding of  xxxd2625xxx , whereas ⑀asp-173
at the periphery contributes to binding of d-tc; the intervening
residues, while likely proximal to bound antagonist, may contribute hydrophobicity or van der waals contacts rather than
specific polar interactions.
residues in the ␣ subunit also contribute selectively to antagonist binding. mutations targeting the three signature tyrosines found in all nicotinic receptors had to be structurally
conservative to prevent loss of expression. the mutation
␣y198t markedly diminishes affinity of both antagonists, but
the mutation ␣y198f selectively increases affinity of d-tc
(fig. 2 and table ii). mutations of ␣tyr-93 and ␣tyr-190 have
only minor effects on binding of both antagonists (table ii); the
␣y190t mutation eliminated ␣-bungarotoxin binding (not
shown), either through misfolding or by preventing binding of
the toxin, and could not be studied further. thus ␣tyr-198
contributes to binding of both antagonists, but the selective
enhancement of binding by ␣y198f makes it a good candidate
for direct interaction with d-tc.
to determine the origin of the mutational specificity at the
atomic structural level, we computed docking orientations of
d-tc and  xxxd2625xxx  to our structural model of the ␣⫺⑀-binding site of the human achr (13). because proteins are intrinsically dynamic, we employed a computational strategy that
accounts for this key property. we therefore used md simulation to generate an ensemble of protein structures accessible to
the antagonist and computed docking of antagonist to each
snapshot of the dynamic structure. the computational analysis
was patterned after the pioneering work of mccammon and
co-workers (17) and our application of that approach to curariform antagonist binding to achbp (18). one difference, however, was the need to constrain the ␣-carbon backbone of the
achr ligand binding domain during md simulation, while

allowing free movement of all side chains (see “experimental
procedures”). we therefore carried out a 1-ns md simulation,
with the ␣-carbon backbone constrained, and collected 1000
frames of the dynamic structure for computation of antagonist
docking.
application of autodock 3.0.3 generated 10 docked structures per frame to give a total of 10,000 docked structures for
each antagonist. we then grouped these into clusters of similar
structures by sorting them into 1-å intervals of the ligand root
mean square deviation (see “experimental procedures”). for
both antagonists, our cluster analysis reveals a predominant
ligand orientation within the binding pocket (cluster 1), along
with several smaller clusters with different orientations (fig.
4). for d-tc, comparison of orientations in clusters 1 and 2
reveals only a minor shift of the ligand within the binding
pocket, whereas for  xxxd2625xxx , clusters 1 and 2 represent

no.

fundamentally different orientations (fig. 4). the most frequent orientation produced by autodock has been shown for
many protein-ligand complexes to agree well with the bound
orientation observed in x-ray structures of the complexes (19).
we nevertheless considered the orientation of  xxxd2625xxx  in
cluster 2 a formal possibility to be evaluated in light of our
mutagenesis results.
our computational determinations indicate that d-tc and
 xxxd2625xxx , despite having identical molecular scaffolds and
rigid cyclic structures, bind in distinctly different orientations
to the ␣⫺⑀ site of the adult human achr (fig. 5). the concave
hydrophobic face of  xxxd2625xxx  lies across ␤-strands 5⬘, 6, and
2 of the ⑀ subunit (8, 13), with one of the two quaternary
nitrogens (n2) penetrating deep into the binding site to juxtapose ⑀tyr-111 and ⑀thr-117, and the other quaternary nitrogen
(n1) extending peripherally to approach the ␤8-␤9 linker harboring ⑀asp-173 and ⑀asp-175. by contrast, the concave face of
d-tc orients toward the ␣ subunit, with its quaternary nitrogen (n2) juxtaposing ␣tyr-198, and its tertiary nitrogen (n1)
projecting peripherally toward ⑀asp-173 in the ␤8-␤9 linker.
the change in orientation from that of  xxxd2625xxx  to that of
d-tc results from tilt of the curariform scaffold by ⬃60o normal
to the nitrogen-nitrogen axis, together with a 20o rotation
about the axis.
table iii lists computationally determined distances between key atoms of each antagonist and determinants of binding at the ␣⫺⑀ subunit interface. the key atoms of the antagonists include the most proximal nitrogen to the binding
determinant in question, as well as the most proximal carbon
atom in the curariform scaffold. these distances are mean
values computed from all frames of the dynamic structure in
cluster 1 (fig. 4); for both antagonists mean values are also
listed for cluster 2.
the computed separation distances for the predominant

together with the selective effects of the mutations ⑀y111k and
⑀y111f on  xxxd2625xxx  binding, strongly support a cation-␲
interaction at ⑀tyr-111 stabilizing bound  xxxd2625xxx . analogously, the aromatic ring of ␣tyr-198 is 3 å from n2 of d-tc,
whereas it is 6.6 å from n2 of  xxxd2625xxx ; these very different
separation distances, and the selective enhancement of d-tc
affinity by the mutation ␣y198f, strongly support a cation-␲
interaction at ␣tyr-198 stabilizing bound d-tc. the ␤-carbon
atom of ⑀thr-117 is 4.7 å away from n2 of  xxxd2625xxx  and 3.6
å from the closest carbon atom in the hydrocarbon scaffold,
whereas the analogous distances are 9.8 and 6.2 å for d-tc;
these separation distances indicate close proximity of ⑀thr-117
to bound  xxxd2625xxx  but not to d-tc, in excellent agreement
with the nearly absolute selectivity of the mutation ⑀t117k in
decreasing  xxxd2625xxx  affinity. our computationally determined separation distances indicate additional selective contributions to  xxxd2625xxx  relative to d-tc affinity, including
distances between  xxxd2625xxx  and ⑀leu-109, ⑀gly-57, and
⑀asp-59 (table ii), in agreement with the selective effects of the
corresponding lysine mutations on  xxxd2625xxx  affinity (fig. 2
and table i). thus  xxxd2625xxx  and d-tc encounter different
residues at the ␣⫺⑀ site by binding in distinctly different
orientations.
the computational results also disclose common contributions of binding site residues to both antagonists (table iii).
the major common source of stabilization is ⑀leu-119, which
achieves close contact of 3.5 å with the hydrocarbon scaffold of
 xxxd2625xxx  and 3 å with that of d-tc. mutation of ⑀leu-119 to
lysine markedly decreases binding affinity for both antagonists, in good agreement with the short separation distances,
and suggesting that ⑀leu-119 stabilizes each bound antagonist
through hydrophobic interactions.
finally, the computational results confirm our observations
that particular candidate residues do not affect antagonist
binding following mutation. for example, ⑀asn-107, which is

deep in the binding pocket, is 14.3 å from n2 in  xxxd2625xxx  and
12.1 å from n2 in d-tc, in agreement with the lack of effect of
the lysine mutation at this position (table i). similarly,
␣tyr-93 and ␣tyr-190 are far from the nearest nitrogen atom of
either bound antagonist, with separation distances of 14.4 and
13.4 å for  xxxd2625xxx  and 13 and 12 å for d-tc, in line with the
weak effects of mutations of these conserved tyrosines.
the computationally determined separation distances, together with our mutagenesis results, provide strong support for
the orientation of  xxxd2625xxx  in the predominant cluster 1
compared with that in cluster 2 (fig. 4). in cluster 1, the
␤⫺carbon of ⑀thr-117 is 4.7 å away from n2 in  xxxd2625xxx  and
3.4 å from the nearest carbon atom in the  xxxd2625xxx  scaffold;
for cluster 2 the analogous distances are greater, 5.9 and 7.6 å
(table iii). similarly, in cluster 1, the aromatic rings of ⑀tyr111 and ␣tyr-198 are 4.1 and 6.6 å from n2 in  xxxd2625xxx ,
whereas in cluster 2 the separation distances are 6 and 10.2 å.
separation distances for other key determinants of  xxxd2625xxx 
binding also strongly favor the orientation in cluster 1 over that
in cluster 2; these include distances between  xxxd2625xxx  and
⑀leu-109, ⑀leu-119, ⑀asp-173, and ⑀asp-59. for d-tc, on the
other hand, the key separation distances are similar for clus-

frames from cluster 1 for each antagonist are displayed (see fig. 4). the
␣ subunit face of the binding site is highlighted in red and the ⑀ subunit
face in green. bound antagonist, in space-filling representation, is colorcoded according to charge distribution, with red indicating negative and

ligand in the binding pocket by referring to nitrogens n1 and n2.

curare is the prototypical competitive antagonist of the
achr found at the motor end plate, providing the structural
template that established the antagonist pharmacophore for
this receptor, as well as serving as a key probe for establishing
the subunit interface structure of the ligand binding domain.
members of the curare family contain two positively charged
nitrogen atoms spaced 9 –11 å apart (11, 12), and these have
been shown to span the interface between ␣ and non-␣ subunits
(20). many structurally unrelated competitive antagonists of
the end plate achr also contain two positively charged nitrogens, with the correct spacing, and like curare are thought to
span the subunit interface. the competitive antagonist pharmacophore of the achr together with the requirement of both
␣ and non-␣ subunits for antagonist binding suggest that antagonists within a given structural family bridge the subunit
interface in the same orientation. our observation to the contrary that d-tc and  xxxd2625xxx  bind in distinctly different
orientations has profound implications for design of drugs targeted against the family of nicotinic receptors.
the nicotinic receptor ligand binding domain is formed by
seven loops spaced far apart on the protein chains of the ␣ and
non-␣ subunits (1, 21). binding of curariform antagonists relies
on residues found within a subset of these seven loops and
include both conserved and non-conserved residues. conserved
determinants include ␣tyr-198 in loop c, ⑀trp-55 in loop e,
⑀leu-109 and ⑀leu-119 in loop f, and ⑀asp-173 in loop g.
non-conserved determinants include ⑀asp-59 in loop e and
⑀tyr-111 and ⑀thr-117 in loop f. the chemical nature of these
non-conserved residues varies widely among species and subtypes of muscle achr, with asp (human ⑀) and ala (frog ⑀)
found at the aligned position 59; tyr (human ⑀), ser (bovine ⑀),
and arg (torpedo ␦) at the aligned position 111; and thr
(human ⑀) and tyr (frog ⑀) at the aligned position 117. the
presence of non-conserved determinants of ligand binding
means that among different species and subtypes of achrs,
subtle structural differences at the binding site may affect the
energetically most favorable orientation of bound ligand as
much as the difference of three methyl groups between d-tc
and  xxxd2625xxx , causing different orientations of a given antagonist when bound to different types of achr.
promise for understanding the achr ligand binding domain
at atomic resolution emerged with discovery and structural
determination of achbp (8). demonstration that side chain
register in ␤-strands is maintained between achr and achbp
enabled construction of realistic, atomic scale homology models
of the achr ligand binding domain (13). both the structure of
achbp and homology models of achr account for the subunit
interface and multiloop structure of the ligand-binding site.
the present results satisfy an additional criterion for accuracy
of our structural model of the achr ligand binding domain,
namely that it has the predictive power to explain the different
docking orientations of  xxxd2625xxx  and d-tc bound to the ␣⫺⑀
site of the human achr.
we recently reported that d-tc and  xxxd2625xxx  bind in distinct orientations to achbp using an analogous approach to
that used in this study (18). the origin of the different orientations was ascribed to differences in the x-ray structures of the
two antagonists, likely to be present in solution (26), that allow
rearrangement of the positively charged ligands in the aromatic-rich binding site. distinct docking orientations have also
been observed for different steroids bound to sex hormone
binding globulin, as determined by x-ray crystallography and
confirmed by mutagenesis together with measurements of

binding affinity (28). c19 androgens and estradiol were found
to bind in opposite orientations where the a and d rings of the
two steroids switch places within the binding pocket and the
planes of the scaffolds flip by 180o. thus distinct docking orientations of structurally similar ligands may be a widespread
phenomenon among protein-binding sites.
both achbp and the achr show considerable versatility in
accommodating the flatter  xxxd2625xxx  and the more compact
d-tc. however the bound orientations of each antagonist differ
between the achr and achbp. for  xxxd2625xxx  bound to
achr, the concave hydrophobic face orients toward the ⑀ subunit, but when bound to achbp, this face orients toward the
principal ␣ subunit face. for d-tc bound to either achr or
achbp, the concave face orients toward the ␣ subunit. however in achr, n2 is proximal to ␣tyr-198 and n1 is far from
␣tyr-93, whereas in achbp, n1 is proximal to tyr-89 (equivalent to ␣tyr-93) and n2 is far from tyr-192 (equivalent to
␣tyr-198). in both achr and achbp, the aligned residues
⑀leu-119 and met-114 provide common sources of hydrophobic
stabilization. the very different orientations of d-tc and  xxxd2625xxx  bound to achr and achbp are examples of the diverse orientations expected from the presence of non-conserved
residues at the achr-binding site.
previous studies of  xxxd2625xxx  binding to fetal mouse achr
strongly suggest that tyr-117 of the ␥ subunit contributes to
binding through a cation-␲ interaction (21, 23). however, our
results suggest that receptor subtype and species differences
can also cause different bound orientations of a given ligand. it
is therefore not surprising that the proposed orientation of
d-tc in complex with the fetal mouse achr (22) is very different from that in our complex with adult human achr. in the
complex with mouse achr the concave face of d-tc orients
toward the ␣ subunit, as observed here, but the nitrogennitrogen axis orients very differently between the two types of
receptors. n1 juxtaposes ␥tyr-117 deep in the binding pocket of

mouse achr, whereas it projects peripherally toward the
␤8-␤9 linker in our complex with human achr. the deduced
complex between d-tc and the ␣⫺␥ site of mouse achr was
based on the effects of mutations of ␥tyr-117 on binding of a
series of structural analogs of curare (23). our results show
that bound orientations of d-tc and  xxxd2625xxx  may not be
interchangeable at a given achr-binding site, posing difficulty
interpreting results from a series of curare analogs to deduce a
single bound orientation for the family of curariform
antagonists.
despite the excellent agreement between experimental and
computational determinations of curariform antagonist docking observed here, there are limitations in the analysis and
interpretation. the accuracy of our structural model, while
apparently very good in the center of the binding pocket where
the achr and achbp share many conserved residues, is uncertain in the peripheral linker joining ␤⫺strands 8 and 9 (13).
because the ␤8-␤9 linker of the ⑀ subunit contributes to d-tc
binding, albeit weakly, the overall docked orientation could
potentially change from that presented here once the structure
of this non-conserved linker region is resolved. also, the functional state of our structural model is uncertain, although
recent electron microscopic detection of an ach-induced conformational change in the ␣ subunits suggest that the functional state is either active or desensitized (23). curariform
antagonists, however, show only small preferences for binding
to active or desensitized states relative to the resting state (24,
25), suggesting that the docked orientations delineated here
represent those that mediate functional antagonism of the
adult human achr.
our overall results show that both d-tc and  xxxd2625xxx  are
stabilized by residues from both the ␣ and non-␣ subunits, in
agreement with a large body of work defining the subunit
interface structure of the achr ligand binding domain (1, 21).
however, contrary to expectations, the two antagonists bind in

docking modes of curare analogs to the achr
different orientations at the ␣⫺⑀ subunit interface, where each
antagonist contacts different residues. this fundamental result
cautions against the broad application of the classical antagonist pharmacophore concept in interpreting drug structureactivity relationships, which tacitly assumes similar bound
orientations of ligands within a given structural family. structure-based drug design typically starts with a lead compound
and adds or subtracts chemical groups in order to optimize
binding affinity. however, our results show that subtle chemical modifications can substantially alter bound ligand orientations and, by extension, suggest that subtle differences between subtypes and species of the drug target could have the
same effect. clearly, rational drug design can be optimized by
knowing the atomic coordinates of both the active site and the
ligand, and by combining these with a docking analysis that
incorporates the dynamics of the structure. our overall findings have important implications for the design of drugs targeting nicotinic receptors as well as other members of the
pentameric ligand-gated ion channel superfamily.
