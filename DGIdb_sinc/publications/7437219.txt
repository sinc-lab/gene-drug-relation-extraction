effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking
agents on the cardiac vagus nerve in the guineapig
s. lee son and d. r. waud
summary

 xxxd2174xxx  and pancuronium are known to produce tachycardia. in previous studies (lee son
and waud, 1978) block of the response to preganglionic vagal stimulation could be demonstrated with pancuronium and  xxxd2174xxx  at
concentrations which would occur during block of
neuromuscular transmission. it has also been
shown (lee son and waud, 1977) that, although
muscarinic receptors on the atrium can be blocked
by neuromuscular blocking agents, the concentrations required are too great to explain the vagal
block. the effect of  xxxd3456xxx ,  xxxd2625xxx ,
pancuronium and  xxxd2174xxx  in blocking stimulation of the postganglionic vagal fibres was examined with a view to assessing the contribution of
ganglionic blockade of the vagus nerve to the
tachycardia produced by pancuronium and
 xxxd2174xxx .
methods

rationale
a drug producing tachycardia could have
several sites of action, all involving the vagal
innervation of the pacemaker. it could occlude
muscarinic receptors on the pacemaker cell, it
could interfere with release of acetylcholine from
the postganglionic nerve ending, or it could interfere with transmission through the parasympathetic ganglion. the left side of figure 1 summarizes
schematically the functional relationship of these
s.

sites. there are known examples of all three types
of action, including occlusion of muscarinic receptors by atropine and interference with ganglionic
transmission by hexamethonium. the presynaptic
terminal as a site of drug action has been postulated frequently in connection with action of drugs
at the neuromuscular junction (riker, 1975).
the vagal system might be activated at three
points: preganglion, postganglion, or at the muscarinic receptor (fig. 1). idrug influences on the
response to presynaptic stimulation and to receptor activation were examined in two previous
studies (lee son and waud, 1977, 1978). the
present experiments were designed to complement
these studies and to use the three set of results to
identify the relative contribution of blockade at
these three sites of action in the production of
tachycardia. presynaptic stimulation and receptor
stimulation were easily obtained. in the former
case electric stimulation was applied to the vagal
trunk (lee son and waud, 1978). receptor activation was achieved by administration of the muscarinic agonist carbachol (lee son and waud, 1977).
stimulation of the postganglionic fibres—so crucial to distinguishing ganglionic effects from effects at the terminal nerve ending—is more difficult to do; the postganglionic fibres are embedded in the atrial muscle. thus any electrical shock
applied to these fibres will also be applied to the
heart muscle. in the present study the nerve fibres
were activated selectively by timing the stimulus
pulses so that they occurred during the refractory
period of the heart muscle (see below).
the above experimental design can be summarized in terms of how various experimental
results would be interpreted. (1) interference with

the ability of  xxxd2174xxx ,  xxxd2625xxx , pancuronium,  xxxd3456xxx  and atropinc to block the response to
postganglionic stimulation of the vagus nerve were measured in isolated, spontaneously beating guineapig
atria. from analysis of the results in conjunction with those of earlier assays of concentrations that block
effects of preganglionic vagal stimulation, it was concluded that only  xxxd3456xxx  possessed ganglionic
blocking activity. from calculation of the extent of block of muscarinic receptors at drug concentrations
which blocked the response to postganglionic vagal stimulation, it was concluded that  xxxd2174xxx  and
pancuronium have an antivagal action exerted most probably on the postganglionic nerve terminal, and
that this action is the most likely explanation of the tachycardia seen clinically with these two drugs.

fig. 1. schematic diagram of vagal innervation of the cardiac pacemaker. a preganglionic fibre passes the
signal across the ganglionic synapse to the ganglionic cell, which, through its postganglionic axon, releases
acetylcholine to activate a muscarinic receptor on the cardiac pacemaker cell. the left side of the diagram
indicates the three sites of drug action of interest in this study. the right side indicates the points at which
the signalling system has been activated.

the response to preganglionic stimulation at drug
concentrations likely to be present clinically would
indicate that a vagal blocking action underlay the
tachycardia. (2) interference with the response to
preganglionic stimulation more than that to postganglionic stimulation would indicate a ganglionic
blocking action. (3) interference with the response
to carbachol would give a measure of atropine-like
activity. (4) interference with the response to
postganglionic stimulation beyond what would be
expected from atropine-like activity would indicate an action on the nerve terminal.
the quantitative aspects of applying these principles is described in the discussion.
experimental
guineapigs of either sex weighing 250-500 g
were killed by a blow on the head and the right
atrium was excised rapidly. the vagus nerve was
severed near the heart leaving just the vagal fibres
within the atrial muscle, including the parasympathetic ganglion cells and the postganglionic
nerve fibres. the atrium was suspended in krebs'
solution at 36 °c, which was bubbled with oxygen
95% and carbon dioxide 5%. a pair of external
recording electrodes was used to sense surface

electrical activity of the spontaneously beating
preparation (fig. 2). this signal was used to
monitor automaticity by measuring the interval
between beats and to trigger a train of impulses
used to produce field stimulation. to this end, a
pair of stimulating electrodes was placed in the
bath, one on either side of the tissue. a voltage
applied to these electrodes drove current through
both the muscle and nerve cells in the preparation.
a pulse generator producing supramaximal pulses
of 0.3 ms duration, at a frequency of 100 hz was
used to deliver a train of impulses for field
stimulation. this train was timed to come during
the refractory period of the atrial muscle cells.
since the refractory period of a nerve is much
shorter than that of the cardiac muscle, the nerve
will have recovered while the muscle was still
refractory. thus it was possible to stimulate nerve
fibres and not the muscle by delivering a train of
impulses during this interval. the number of
impulses per train was varied from 1 to 9.
such "field" stimulation produced a transient
increase in the interval between beats. this interval increased as the number of impulses per train
was increased (fig. 3). thus a graph relating
interval between beats to train length could be

atropine was added to the bath and the response to
field stimulation redetermined. finally, the drug

effect (fig. 4).
the effect of the addition of either one of the
neuromuscular blocking agents or atropine was to
"scale down" the train length-interval curves; that
is, for any given train length, the change in interval
between beats was reduced by roughly the same

an iterative non-linear least squares fitting process

laboratory (waud, 1975)).

 xxxd2174xxx ,  xxxd2625xxx , pancuronium and  xxxd3456xxx  all depressed the response to field stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion. figure 4 gives
an example of the results obtained and figure 5
summarizes the dose-response relationship for the
agents studied. the fb j 0 values obtained are
listed in table i. also included for comparison are
"vb 50 " values, the concentration blocking preganglionic vagal stimulation by 50% (lee son and
waud, 1978) and estimates of the apparent dissociation constant, kb at the cholinergic receptors of
the atrial pacemaker (lee son and waud, 1977).
the method of field stimulation developed for
this study has proved both powerful and convenient. sympathetic nerve fibres also lie in the
preparation and can be activated by field stimulation (blinks, 1967). however, we have found that
parasympathetic endings can be selectively activated by not stimulating the preparation during
every beat, as blinks did, but by using only a single
train of pulses and examining the succeeding
interval between beats. apparently, the response
to stimulation of parasympathetic nerve fibres
develops more rapidly than that to sympathetic
activation. in fact, there seems to be no detectable
contribution from the sympathetic system in the
present study since propranolol was without effect
on the relationship between train length and
interval between succeeding beats. because parasympathetic activation can be selectively achieved
by appropriate choice of stimulating parameters
and without use of "pharmacological tools," interpretation of the results is not clouded by the
possibility of contributions from any drugs in the
system other than that being examined.
absolute drug concentrations have no pharmacological significance. with the neuromuscular
blocking agents the concentration effective at the

exerts no differential effect on pre- v. postganglionic stimulation, that is a drug not acting at
ganglia. table i shows that this ratio is 2.9 for
atropine. for comparison,figure6 shows the effect
of hexamethonium on the system. vb j0 was about
60 umol litre" 1 ,
whereas
hexamethonium
100 umol litre" l produced negligible block of field
stimulation, that is the fb 50 was considerably
greater than 100 umol litre" 1 . thus the ratio
vb j0 /fb j0 would be much less than unity. the
neuromuscular blocking agents can now be examined against this background. the values of
3.57, 1.88 and 1.44 seen with  xxxd2174xxx , pancuronium and  xxxd2625xxx  respectively were of the
same order of magnitude as that seen with atropine. on the other hand,  xxxd3456xxx  blocked
responses to preganglionic stimulation more selectively than did atropine. the value of vb 30 /fb j0
was 0.29, less than unity as seen also with hexamethonium and reflecting the well known ganglionic blocking activity of  xxxd3456xxx  (hughes
and chappie, 1976).
the absence of a vagal ganglionic blocking
action of  xxxd2174xxx  and pancuronium means one
must look peripheral to the ganglion to find the site
of the vagal blocking action of these agents observed previously (lee son and waud, 1978).
atropine again provides the clue. from the
atropine-muscarinic receptor dissociation constant, kb, of 0.00063 umol litre" 1 (lee son and
waud, 1977) one can calculate that the receptor
occlusion by atropine at the fb
of
0.004 umol litre" 1 would be (waud, 1968):30

corresponding values can be calculated for the
neuromuscular blocking agents examined and are
given in table i, with the fraction of receptors that
would still be available to the transmitter.
 xxxd3456xxx  gives values indistinguishable from
those for atropine, indicating that this neuromuscular blocking agent has no effect on the response
to field stimulation beyond that which would be
expected from its (weak) ability to block muscarinic receptors. on the other hand,  xxxd2174xxx ,
pancuronium and  xxxd2625xxx  leave roughly three
to five times as many receptors free when they are

neuromuscular junction should be considered.
since roughly 90% of the end-plate receptors
must be occluded to produce a full neuromuscular
block, we may take the concentration producing
this effect as relevant to the clinical concentration.
the dissociation constants at the neurornuscular
junction are  xxxd3456xxx  0.107 umol litre" 1
±0.005
(sem);
 xxxd2625xxx 
0.0552 umol litre" l ± 0.0093 (sem); pancuronium 0.0247 umol litre" 1 ±0.0014 (sem);  xxxd2174xxx  0.458 umol litre"' ±0.031 (sem) respectively (lee son and waud, 1977). thus clinical
neuromuscular block would involve concentrations of about 0.96 umol litre" 1 for  xxxd3456xxx , 0.50 umol litre" 1 for  xxxd2625xxx , 0.22 umol litre" 1 for pancuronium and
4.12 umol litre" 1 for  xxxd2174xxx . thus, for example when we see in figure 5 and table i that it
requires roughly 150 umol litre" 1 of  xxxd3456xxx 
to block field stimulation, we can conclude the
drug would produce no block at this anatomical
level when given clinically.
the measure of field stimulation used, fb j 0 , is
an arbitrarily chosen endpoint. similarly, vb j0
values previously obtained also involve no absolute standard. thus a frame of reference is
needed for comparison of drug effects on pre- and
postganglionic stimulation. atropine provides
such a measure. the site of block with atropine is
common to the pathway of signal transmission for
both pre- and postganglionic vagal stimulation.
therefore, the ratio of vb5o/fb5o for atropine
represents the value expected from a drug which

at their fbso concentrations. this means they are
blocking field stimulation by some mechanism
beyond a simple atropine-like receptor occlusion.
the site of this effect must be peripheral to the
ganglionic synapse and proximal to the muscarinic
receptor. the postganglionic axon and the nerve
terminal thereof are two potential sites of action in
this interval. the latter, the nerve ending, seems a
more likely candidate since appreciable local
anaesthetic activity has not been found with competitive neuromuscular blocking agents (jarcho et
al., 1950; riker and wescoe, 1951; buckett et al.,
1968). the nerve terminal action is not clinically
significant in the case of  xxxd2625xxx  since it occurs
at concentrations too great to be likely to occur
clinically. however, this presynaptdc action appears to be the best candidate to explain the
tachycardia
seen
with
 xxxd2174xxx 
and
pancuronium.
a presynaptdc site of action of drugs is not
without ample precedent (langer, 1974; riker,
1975). of particular interest is the adrenergic
terminal where analogues of noradrenaline depress transmitter output (berthelsen and pettinger,
1977). in this context, it is not surprising that
quaternary nitrogen compounds might similarly
interfere with release at a cholinergic nerve
ending. it has also been suggested that clonidine,
which acts at the presynaptic alpha-adrenergic
receptor, might also act on a presynaptic receptor
to inhibit release of transmitter from cholinergic
fibres (werner, starke and schumann, 1972).
however, the relationship of this phenomenon to
the presynaptic action seen in the present study is
not clear. at present the experiments only reveal
that the presynaptic effect exists, and do not shed
light on its mechanism.
