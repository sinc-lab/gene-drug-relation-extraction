abstract
inhaled h2-adrenoceptor agonists are by far the most effective and safe bronchodilators currently available. they have not been surpassed
by any other bronchodilating principle. the way to this position has been long and started with the first successful treatment of acute, severe
asthma with s.c. injections of adrenaline 100 years ago. over the years, synthetic congeners of adrenaline have been produced and tested for
their pharmacological properties. during the first decades, little attention was given airway smooth muscle. the discovery of  xxxd2398xxx  in
1940 was the first major step towards selective bronchodilation. this compound became a key tool for the classification of adrenoceptors into
a and h. salbutamol and terbutaline were the first to show a significant attenuation of the cardiostimulant effect and confirmed the
subdivision of h-adrenoceptors into h1 and h2. much effort was made to eliminate the next dose-limiting side effect, skeletal muscle tremor
but in vain. prolonged duration of action was achieved in three ways: with  xxxd283xxx , an orally active carbamate ester prodrug of
terbutaline, salmeterol, an inhaled h2-adrenoceptor agonist emerging from a purposeful research project, and  xxxd2155xxx  which was found,
accidentally, to have a long duration of action when inhaled. throughout the 20th century, h-adrenoceptor agonists have been developed and
marketed as racemates. the pharmacological activity usually resides in the (r)-enantiomer. despite claims for the opposite, there is so far no
compelling evidence that the presence of the less active (s)-enantiomer is of any harm to the patient. one hundred years of experience of
structural modifications of adrenaline has shown that the possibilities to modify the properties of this endogenous prototype appear to be
unlimited. d 2002 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. inhaled b2-adrenoceptor agonists, the mainstay in
asthma treatment
‘‘inhaled h2-agonists are by far the most effective bronchodilators currently available’’ (barnes, 1997). this is the
way many articles in this field begin today. however, the
confidence in sympathomimetics has not always been that
obvious. fifty years ago, remedies for asthma offered by
various pharmaceutical companies included formulations
containing ephedrine, supplemented with theophylline, caffeine, sedatives and analgetics. moreover, the increased death
rates in asthma in the mid-1960s was associated with the
increased use of  xxxd2398xxx  in pressurized, metered dose
inhalers (inman and adelstein, 1969). since then, waves of
concern regarding adverse effects of h-adrenoceptor agonists
have emerged followed by pleas for their safety (sears et al.,
1990; giuntini and paggiaro, 1995; kips and pauwels, 2001).

the experience today is that, in patients taking inhaled
glucocorticosteroids, regular use of the long-acting h2-adrenoceptor agonists  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol increase asthma
control compared with monotherapy with the steroid (pauwels et al., 1997; woolcock et al., 1996). over the years, the
h2-adrenoceptor agonists have not been surpassed in efficacy
and safety by any other bronchodilating principle.
this review will take us back to the very beginning, the
first successful use of adrenaline in asthma. from there we
will follow, step by step, the development of synthetic
analogues of adrenaline with improved pharmacodynamic
and pharmacokinetic properties up to the long-acting and
selective h2-adrenoceptor agonists available today. although
h-adrenoceptor agonists have a number of effects on various
airway effector cells, emphasis will be on bronchodilation,
the principal anti-asthmatic effect of this class of compounds
(barnes, 1997). there is an unfortunate confusion of generic
names in this field, starting with the prototype adrenaline
which got the name epinephrine in american usage (max,
1988). this confusion extends to the name of these drugs as a
class where h-adrenoceptor agonists and h-adrenergic ago-

2. adrenaline, ephedrine and the sympathomimetic
amines
in the beginning of the 20th century, bullowa and kaplan
(1903) reported on an extremely successful treatment of
severe acute asthma with subcutaneous injections of adrenaline. the patients were dramatically relieved within a few
minutes. in those days, the dyspnoe in asthma was thought
to be due to turgidity of the bronchial mucosa, the so-called
angioparetic theory. the rationale to try adrenaline was its
pronounced vasoconstrictor effect, which at that time was a
new discovery. the authors concluded ‘‘in conformity with
the angioparetic theory of an attack, the dose must be such
as will cause prompt general vasoconstriction’’. it was only
years later that the relaxing capacity of adrenaline on airway
smooth muscle was recognized (kahn, 1907), let be that this
author suggested an indirect inhibitory action via ganglia in
the tracheal wall rather than a direct relaxing effect on the
muscle fibres. this misconception and confusion on the
mode of action may have delayed the development of
bronchodilating analogues of adrenaline significantly.
though highly efficient, adrenaline was not the ideal drug.
besides the desired therapeutic effect, bronchodilation, it
caused hypertension, tachycardia and tremor. moreover, due
to metabolic instability, it had a short duration of action and
had to be given parenterally.
during the first decade after the chemical structure of
adrenaline had been established, a large number of derivatives were synthetized and tested for their pharmacological
properties. barger and dale (1910), in their classical paper,
coined the term ‘‘sympathomimetic’’ for the action of this
class of compounds. although they described motor as well
as inhibitory effects of their test compounds, focus was on
vasoconstriction and pressor effects. little attention appears
to have been given airway smooth muscle and, as expressed
in a coeval review of the field, during the following years
nothing of particular interest developed (hartung, 1931). so
the next step in the symptomatic treatment of asthma was
not a synthetic derivative of adrenaline but the introduction

fig. 1. three naturally occurring h-adrenoceptor agonists. adrenaline is
unselective, ephedrine is largely indirectly acting whereas s1319 is highly
selective for h2-adrenoceptors.

in western medicine of the natural product, ephedrine by
chen and schmidt (1924). ephedrine, the active principle of
the old chinese anti-asthma drug ma huang, is structurally
related to adrenaline (fig. 1) but it is a poor h-adrenoceptor
agonist (trendelenburg et al., 1963; waldeck and widmark,
1985) and has largely an indirect mode of action (aviado,
1970). it is still unknown to what extent ephedrine acts by
direct bronchodilation or by mucosal decongestion in
asthma. ephedrine had an advantage, however, because it
is metabolically more stable than adrenaline and can thus be
taken orally. moreover, it has a longer duration of action.

3.  xxxd2398xxx , the first step towards selective action on
bronchial smooth muscle
while attempts had been made to find analogues of
adrenaline with an improved bronchodilatory profile (tainter
et al., 1934; cameron and tainter, 1936), only konzett
(1940a) could demonstrate a significant step forward with
 xxxd2398xxx  (table 2), regarded as the first sympathomimetic amine completely devoid of pressor effects. as a
matter of fact,  xxxd2398xxx  causes a pronounced depression
of blood pressure (konzett, 1940b). however, this does not
appear to be the full truth. in a comprehensive investigation
of hydroxylated derivatives of ephedrine, schaumann

(1931) showed that a-ethyladrenaline (termed h-äthylsuprarenin in his study), being equipotent with adrenaline
in stimulating the heart, had no pressor effect but indeed
lowered the blood pressure dose-dependently in the anaesthetized dog. unfortunately, airway smooth muscle was not
included in the study but the available data suggest, retrospectively, that this compound might have been a good
bronchodilator.
konzett denoted the isopropyl group attached to the
nitrogen atom as ‘‘broncholysophore’’, i.e. carrying the
bronchospasmolytic effect. the unique properties of  xxxd2398xxx  contributed decisively to ahlquist’s classification of
adrenoceptors into a and  xxxd736xxx  years later (ahlquist, 1948)
and from now on we can talk about h-adrenoceptor agonists
as a class.  xxxd2398xxx  is an early example of cooperation
between university and industry since konzett, at that time
pharmacologist at the vienna university, got the compound
for evaluation from chemists at boehringer-ingelheim in
germany (konzett, 1981).  xxxd2398xxx  for inhalation soon
became a popular remedy for asthma, but there were still
problems with considerable cardiac stimulation, even with a
fatal outcome (inman and adelstein, 1969). moreover,
being a catecholamine like adrenaline,  xxxd2398xxx  is rapidly metabolized. this limits the duration of effect and the
compound has a poor oral availability.
the concept of a ‘‘broncholysophore’’ group inspired to
modifications. thus a series of phenylisopropyl-derivatives
of  xxxd2398xxx  were synthetized and tested for their bronchospasmolytic effect (biel et al., 1954). among these
compounds, protokylol gained some clinical use as an orally
active and longer acting analogue of  xxxd2398xxx  (weiner,
1980). the molecular skeleton of protokylol with its phenylisopropyl-group attached to the nitrogen has been adopted in
numerous of the h-adrenoceptor agonists to follow (fig. 2).
it is therefore interesting to note that biel’s intention with
this side chain was to incorporate a ‘‘pressor amine’’ in the
molecule, apparently to potentiate the bronchodilator properties and balance the marked depressor effect displayed by
 xxxd2398xxx  thus creating a clinically more satisfactory
antiasthmatic agent. this expectation was not fulfilled,
rather an a1-adrenoceptor antagonistic action was observed
among members of this group of potent h-adrenoceptor

3

agonists (decker et al., 1982). soterenol, another derivative
of  xxxd2398xxx  (table 2) should later be shown to possess an
appreciable a-adrenoceptor stimulant component in addition
to its h-adrenoceptor agonism (dungan et al., 1968).
more familiar as a metabolically stable and longer acting
analogue of  xxxd2398xxx  is its resorcinol-derivative,  xxxd2583xxx  (engelhardt et al., 1961). this compound, apparently the first synthetic resorcinol h-adrenoceptor agonist,
resistant against catechol-o-methyl transferase, is still in use
but its selectivity was not regarded as sufficient and the
cardiac problems had to be solved. among the numerous
analogues of  xxxd2398xxx , synthetized and evaluated for
their pharmacological action, dichloroisoprenaline (table 2)
deserves a special mention. this low efficacy h-adrenoceptor agonist turned out to antagonize competetively the
relaxing effect of adrenaline and  xxxd2398xxx  on airway
smooth muscle (powell and slater, 1958). this discovery
made dichloroisoprenaline the prototype for all h-adrenoceptor antagonists to follow.
4. salbutamol and terbutaline, the first b2-selective
adrenoceptor agonists in general clinical use
inspired by the work of lands and his group (lands et
al., 1950; lands and tainter, 1953; lands and brown,
1964), even before the definitive subclassification of hadrenoceptors into h1 and h2 (lands et al., 1967a,b),
independent investigators considered the possibility of
developing a bronchodilating h-adrenoceptor agonist without adverse effects on the heart. a key observation was that
noradrenaline, being equipotent with adrenaline in stimulating the heart, is a poor bronchodilator. this difference in
physiology was taken as a possibility of finding a drug with
reversed properties, efficient bronchodilation with minimal
cardiac stimulation. as a matter of fact, with  xxxd2391xxx  (the
a-ethyl derivative of  xxxd2398xxx , table 2) a step was taken
in this direction (lands et al., 1950).
the real break-through came with salbutamol (brittain et
al., 1968; cullum et al., 1969) and terbutaline (bergman et
al., 1969; persson and olsson, 1970), compounds invented
and developed independently, and obviously during the

same period of time, by a british and a swedish research
team, respectively. behind the work that led to terbutaline,
there was also the observation that some h-adrenoceptor
antagonists blocked the effects of  xxxd2398xxx  on airway
smooth muscle better than the effects on the heart (persson,
1995). while salbutamol is a saligenin derivative and
terbutaline a resorcinol, both compounds have a tert-butyl
group attached to the nitrogen, a substitution which became
very useful in later developments (table 3 and fig. 3).
salbutamol and terbutaline have very similar pharmacological properties. since both compounds are non-catechol
derivatives of adrenaline they are, like  xxxd2583xxx , resistant against catechol-o-methyl transferase. this promotes
oral availability and a prolonged duration of action (nyberg,
1997).
salbutamol and terbutaline became the first truly h2selective adrenoceptor agonists in general clinical use. they
show a strong relaxing capacity on airway smooth muscle in
concentrations where effect on cardiac muscle is low. in
fact, the two compounds were the tools by which lands’ h2adrenoceptor concept became established. it should be kept
in mind, however, that the development of salbutamol and
terbutaline and the subdivision of h-adrenoceptors into h1
and h2 were based solely on observation of functional
effects in vivo and in vitro. subsequent research has shown
that the high selectivity in action of terbutaline and salbutamol is due to differences in efficacy rather than the subtle
differences in affinity for the two receptor types (rugg et al.,
1978; waldeck et al., 1986; johansson et al., 1990). from
this, it follows that with a screening procedure based on
ligand binding to the receptor, a technique which was not
available at that time, these valuable drugs may have been
dropped.
ligand binding studies, on the other hand, has contributed to the current understanding that the h2-adrenoceptor is
a surface-membrane bound, g-protein coupled 7tm-receptor, operating with c-amp as a second messenger (liggett
and green, 1997). in this way, h2-adrenoceptor agonists act

as functional antagonists, i.e. they relax airway smooth
muscle whatever the contractile stimulus is. this is of great
importance in asthma where a multitude of mediators, such
as histamine, acetylcholine, leukotrienes and tachykinines,
contribute to the bronchoconstriction. more recent research
has revealed that there are genetic variations of the receptor
molecule, which relate to differences in the response to h2adrenoceptor agonists. thus it was found that in an asthmatic cohort, five different h2-adrenoceptor haplotypes
could be identified (drysdale et al., 2000). significant
differences in the bronchodilating effect of salbutamol
between different haplotype groups were observed. if it
can be shown that the order of relative potency or efficacy
of structurally different h2-adrenoceptor agonist differ
among haplotypes, then medication may be individualized
and new drugs developed. there is a risk, however, that the
enormous growth of the gene technology hampers the
integration of the new with the old knowledge. the following statement, quoted from a recent news article will
illustrate the confusion: ‘‘salbutamol, a drug that is aimed
at spurring the muscle relaxing gene into greater action to
treat asthmatic wheezing worked very well.’’ (gottlieb,
2000).

5. ‘‘me too’’ products in the wake of salbutamol and
terbutaline
after the first break-through with a clinically significant
selectivity for h2-adrenoceptors in airway smooth muscle, a
large number of congeners emerged from various pharmaceutical companies. the first in this series appears to have
been  xxxd2098xxx  ( xxxd2098xxx ), a congener of  xxxd2583xxx ,
extended with a p-hydroxyphenyl group on the isopropyl
moiety (fig. 2). perhaps it may be unfair to classify
 xxxd2098xxx  as a ‘‘me too’’ product. with reference to unpublished material (schuster and baum, 1969), this compound
appears to have emerged from the laboratory as a bronchodilating h-adrenoceptor agonist with improved selectivity
already in 1964 and was evaluated in asthmatic patients with
good results a few years later (mattila et al., 1967). however, solid evidence for the h2-adrenoceptor selectivity of
 xxxd2098xxx  was presented only after the publication of the first
results on salbutamol and terbutaline (o’donnell, 1970).
also hexoprenaline (stormann and turnheim, 1973) and
clenbuterol (engelhardt, 1972, 1976) appear to have been
identified as bronchodilating h-adrenoceptor agonists with
reduced cardiovascular effects before the pharmacology of
salbutamol and terbutaline became public knowledge. hexoprenaline, two molecules of noradrenaline with the amino
groups linked together with a hexamethylene chain (fig. 4),
has a remarkable chemical structure where one side of this
symmetric molecule may interact with the active site of the
h-adrenoceptor while the counterpart might govern the h2selectivity. as we will find later on, the hexamethylene
bridge is critical as a spacer arm for extended substitutions

agonist was found in a marine sponge by a japanese
research team (suzuki et al., 1999a). this compound, given
the laboratory code s1319, is a  xxxd304xxx -2-one analogue
of adrenaline (fig. 1). it shows in vitro a relaxing capacity
on airway smooth muscle, in potency exceeding that of
salbutamol a thousand-fold and with a higher efficacy
(suzuki et al., 1999b). this means that it is orders of
magnitude more potent than adrenaline. like other h2adrenoceptor agonists, it also shows a mast cell stabilizing
effect (suzuki et al., 2000). it would be most interesting to
know what physiological function this peculiar compound
may have in a marine organism.

system substituted for the phenyl ring of the prototype, adrenaline.

6. trouble with tremor
of the phenylethanolamine molecule. clenbuterol, besides
its bronchodilating effect, appears to have a pronounced
anabolic effect in animals with increases in body mass and
muscle protein (emery et al., 1984). this property has led to
an illicit use of clenbuterol in animal breeding and cases of
intoxication after ingestion of bovine liver from cattle
treated in this way have been described (martı́nez-navarro,
1990). the subjects affected suffered from muscle tremor
and tachycardia for up to 40 h. nevertheless, clenbuterol has
got a legal use in veterinary medicine for the treatment of
horses with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd)
(erichsen et al., 1994).
other h2-selective adrenoceptor agonists which emerged
from the first wave are tulobuterol (kubo et al., 1975),
 xxxd2155xxx  (ida, 1976a,b), carbuterol (colella et al., 1977),
and  xxxd3017xxx  (yabuuchi, 1977; yabuuchi et al., 1977). two
compounds,  xxxd2964xxx  (moore et al., 1978) and broxaterol
(chiarino et al., 1986) have a heterocyclic ring substituted
for the phenyl ring (fig. 3). the rich freedom in subtitution
of h-adrenoceptor agonists may be illustrated also by aa497 in which the side chain of phenylethanolamine has been
incorporated into an aminotetraline structure (inatomi et al.,
1980). all these compounds differ in potency and efficacy
and in the degree of h2-selectivity as well.  xxxd3017xxx  proved
to be highly potent and extremely selective for h2-adrenoceptors and is a very useful tool for exploring subpopulations of h-adrenoceptors in tissues (johansson and persson,
1983), but in clinical practice  xxxd3017xxx  offered no substantial advantage compared to salbutamol (crowe et al.,
1985). this is because the limit for functional selectivity is
set by the physiology: the presence of h2-adrenoceptors
mediating chronotropic and inotropic effects in the human
heart (ask et al., 1985; levine and leenen, 1989). with the
exception of  xxxd2155xxx , none of the h2-selective adrenoceptor agonists which followed early after salbutamol and
terbutaline offered a clinically significant advantage over the
prototypes and their place on the market remained limited.
ironically enough, 30 years after the development of
synthetic h2-adrenoceptor agonists, an extremely potent,
naturally occurring and highly h2-adrenoceptor selective

it seems to have been forgotten that the next objective in
the development of bronchodilating h-adrenoceptor agonists
was not to increase their duration of action but to eliminate
the skeletal muscle tremor which was considered a doselimiting side effect, particularly after oral administration.
the sympathomimetic-induced muscle tremor has been
shown to be mediated via peripheral h-adrenoceptors (marsden et al., 1967). several pharmaceutical companies worked
hard for almost 10 years to find a new h-adrenoceptor
agonist without this disturbing side effect. the experimental
rationale was the observation by bowman and zaimis
(1958) that adrenaline causes a decrease in fusion and
tension of subtetanic contractions of slow contracting skeletal muscle. this effect, which is open to elaborate studies in
vivo (bowman and nott, 1970) as well as in vitro (waldeck,
1976; holmberg and waldeck, 1980), is thought to result in
amplification of the physiological tremor occurring in the
range 8– 12 hz (bowman, 1980).
for most of the compounds investigated, the bronchodilating effect was accompanied by effects on the skeletal
muscle (bowman and rodger, 1972; malta and raper,
1976; apperley et al., 1976; olsson et al., 1979). however,
a number of compounds emerged which in some animal
experiments showed a certain degree of selectivity between
airway smooth muscle and skeletal muscle such as sulfonterol (kaiser et al., 1975), ah7616 (apperley et al., 1976),
qh25 (larsen and hermansen, 1977) and  xxxd2343xxx  (andersson et al., 1982). among these compounds,  xxxd2343xxx  and
qh25 were selected for evaluation in asthmatic patients.
 xxxd2343xxx  was compared to terbutaline after i.v. injection and
qh25 was compared to salbutamol after oral administration
(löfdahl et al., 1982). both compounds failed to separate
tremor from bronchodilation. apparently, the h-adrenoceptors in the skeletal muscle are too similar to those in airway
smooth muscle to permit a pharmacological differentiation.
however, a significant attenuation of the systemic side
effects is achieved with the inhaled route of administration
as demonstrated for terbutaline (thiringer and svedmyr,
1976) and previously suggested for adrenaline (graeser,
1939).

7. nocturnal asthma, pro-drugs and soft-drugs
facing the fact that elimination of tremor was not
feasible, new lines of development were considered. one
was to find compounds with extended duration of action to
offer protection during a whole night’s sleep. the bronchodilating effect of salbutamol and terbutaline, albeit considerably more durable than that of  xxxd2398xxx , waned within
6 h. since  xxxd2343xxx  had already been approved for clinical
studies and indicated a prolonged effect in animal experiments (olsson and ekdahl, unpublished), the next step was
to compare its duration of action with that of terbutaline
after inhalation. in one study on patients with asthma,
 xxxd2343xxx  showed a bronchodilating action with a slightly
longer duration of action than that of terbutaline (löfdahl
and svedmyr, 1984). similar results appear to have been
obtained with salmefamol compared to salbutamol (sillett et
al., 1976). however, the improvements achieved with these
compounds were not sufficient to be clinically significant
and the search for new compounds continued.
a project, based on the pro-drug principle, led to the
development of  xxxd283xxx , the bis-dimethylcarbamate of
terbutaline (olsson and svensson, 1984).  xxxd283xxx  has no
affinity for the h2-adrenoceptor per se, but it is slowly
converted to terbutaline via a complex oxidative and hydrolytic metabolism (lindberg et al., 1989). the result is a very
smooth plasma concentration of terbutaline for up to 24 h,
enabling once daily oral administation (d’alonzo et al.,
1995).  xxxd283xxx  is not metabolized to a major extent
locally in the lung and is thus not active after inhalation. on
the other hand, activity after inhalation was achieved with
another pro-drug, bitolterol, the bis-p-toluate of colterol
(minatoya, 1978). but colterol is a catecholamine (table
3) and subject to a more rapid metabolism than terbutaline.
the duration of action of a pro-drug is determined by a
subtle balance between the rate of formation of active
metabolite and the rate of elimination of the latter. thus it
is questionable whether bitolterol offers a clear advantage to
salbutamol.
contrasting a pro-drug, a soft-drug is active per se when
given locally but is rapidly inactivated when it reaches the
general circulation. thus, a long duration of action at a
minimum of systemic side effects may be achieved after
inhalation of a h2-agonist designed in this way (albrecht
and loge, 1985). one such example is zk-90055 (fig. 3),
an indol derivative with a hydrolysable ester bond on the
ring system (albrecht et al., 1985, 1987). unfortunately, the
development of zk-90055 was stopped before clinical trials
were commenced and we do not know if the concept holds.
another h-adrenoceptor soft drug candidate, a phenylethanolamine with the ester bond in the n-substituent, has been
suggested for topical treatment of psoriasis (gill et al.,
1994). after hydrolysis, a free carboxyl group in the side
chain is formed and the agonistic activity of the compound
at h-adrenoceptors is eliminated. gill et al. (1994) also
suggested development of combined pro- and soft-drugs to

achieve both long effect duration and a minimum of
systemic effects. this approach, however, requires a critical
balance between activating and inactivating metabolism,
which may be very difficult to achieve.

8.  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol, accidental and purposeful
discoveries
new drugs may emerge in two different ways, as a result
of target-directed research based on a specific hypothesis or
through accidental discoveries. the latest achievements in
the field, the inhaled, long-acting h2-adrenoceptor agonists,
offer examples of both tracks. salmeterol was the result of a
search for a compound with an extremely long duration of
action in preclinical experiments (ball et al., 1991; johnson,
1995). it was thought that, by extension of the substituent at
the amino group of a phenylethanolamine, the molecule
would be able to ‘‘anchor’’ at an ‘‘exosite’’ outside the
active site of the h2-adrenoceptor. this philosophy was
outlined in a review article (brittain et al., 1976), apparently before the project leading to salmeterol was initiated
(johnson, 1995). like hexoprenaline, salmeterol has a
hexamethylene-bridge linking the two parts of the molecule together (fig. 4). the first clinical trial with salmeterol in patients with asthma was carried out in the mid1980s by ullman and svedmyr (1988) and it confirmed
the preclinical evidence of a considerable extension of the
duration of the bronchodilating effect compared to salbutamol.
at about the same time, svedmyr and his team were
asked to evaluate  xxxd2155xxx . the pharmacology of this
highly potent and h2-adrenoceptor selective agonist had
been described about 10 years earlier by ida (1976a,b), in
vitro as well as in vivo. there was no convincing evidence
of a prolonged duration of action compared to salbutamol.
moreover, an oral formulation of  xxxd2155xxx  had just been
introduced and it did not appear to offer a clear advantage to
salbutamol (tasaka, 1986). svedmyr suggested the inhaled
mode of administration and now, together with löfdahl, he
could show in patients with asthma that  xxxd2155xxx  had a
duration of action of at least 8 h, significantly longer than
that exerted by salbutamol (löfdahl and svedmyr, 1989).
given orally,  xxxd2155xxx  was not longer acting than salbutamol.
subsequent clinical studies directly comparing  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol have shown that both compounds have
a duration of action of 12 h or more (rabe et al., 1993; van
noord et al., 1996; palmqvist et al., 1997). this contrasts
with certain results obtained in animal experiments where
 xxxd2155xxx  appears to be shorter acting than salmeterol on
airway smooth muscle in vitro as well as in vivo (nials et
al., 1994). using different experimental conditions, however, it has been possible to demonstrate a long duration of
 xxxd2155xxx  in guinea-pig airways in vivo (erjefält and
persson, 1991) and in vitro (jeppsson et al., 1994). obvi-

ously the predictive value of preclinical experiments in the
evaluation of the effect duration of bronchodilator drugs for
local administration is limited, suffering from both false
positive and false negative results (jeppsson et al., 1989). a
crucial point may be that the duration of action of  xxxd2155xxx , but not salmeterol, appears to be concentrationdependent (anderson et al., 1996). in any way, the exosite
hypothesis, suggested but disputed for salmeterol (nials et
al., 1993; green et al., 1996; bergendal et al., 1996;
teschemacher and lemoine, 1999), does not seem to be
applicable to  xxxd2155xxx  and a more general hypothesis,
‘‘the plasmalemma diffusion microkinetic model’’, based on
differences in physico-chemical properties has been offered
(anderson et al., 1994).
differences in physico-chemical properties may also
explain the slow onset of action of salmeterol compared to
 xxxd2155xxx , a difference first observed on isolated airway
smooth muscle (jeppsson et al., 1989) and repeatedly
demonstrated in clinical investigations (van noord et al.,
1996; palmqvist et al., 1997). the fast onset of action of
 xxxd2155xxx  enables this drug to be used both as reliever
medication and for maintenance treatment. another difference between the two drugs is that salmeterol has a
relatively low efficay whereas the efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  is
high (lindén et al., 1993). this efficacy difference has been
demonstrated in patients with stable asthma, in whom the
broncho-protective effect of  xxxd2155xxx  against metacholine
provocation was dose-related and reached a higher maximum than that of salmeterol (palmqvist et al., 1999), but at
the expence of a higher tremor score at the highest doses.
this means that salmeterol behaves as a partial agonist at
human h2-adrenoceptors. consequently, salmeterol acts as a
competitive antagonist at h2-adrenoceptors against agonists
with higher efficacy as demonstrated in isolated airway
smooth muscle preparations for  xxxd2398xxx  (dougall et
al., 1991), salbutamol, terbutaline and  xxxd2155xxx  (källström
et al., 1994; molimard et al., 1998). however, in patients
with mild asthma, the combined bronchodilating effect of
salmeterol and salbutamol appears to be largely additive
(smyth et al., 1993). whether the difference in efficacy and
potential for antagonism in vivo with salmeterol is of
clinical significance, particularly during periods of acute
severe asthma, is still an open question. another open
question is whether there is a difference in tolerance development to the high efficacy  xxxd2155xxx  compared to the low
efficacy salmeterol. only well controlled clinical studies
will settle this point.
 xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol were followed by a number
of other long-acting h2-adrenoceptor agonists from various companies (waldeck, 1996). of these compounds
ta-2005 (kikkawa et al., 1991) is of particular interest
because preliminary clinical trials indicated a duration of
effect exceeding 24 h after inhalation of only 3 ag (voss,
1994). ta-2005, possessing structural elements from both
 xxxd2155xxx  and  xxxd3017xxx , binds very firmly to the h2adrenoceptor (voss et al., 1992), a property shared by

7

some other agonists which like ta-2005 are based on a
carbostyril skeleton (standifer et al., 1989). however,
unlike the condition for the first generation of h2-adrenoceptor agonists, long-acting candidates which followed
after  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol have not reached the
market. not even ta-2005, which from the beginning
was developed as a pure enantiomer, appears to have
been further promoted. this will take us to the enantiomer issue.

9. the enantiomer issue
the biosynthesis of adrenaline involves the stereoselective introduction of a hydroxyl-group in the side chain by
dopamine h-hydroxylase. thus, endogenous adrenaline is
levorotatory and has the (r)-configuration with modern
denomination (patil et al., 1970). synthesis of adrenaline
and its analogues using classical chemical methods results
in a racemic mixture of the (r)- and the (s)-enantiomers. it
was early found that the pharmacological activity of racemic
adrenaline resides predominantly in the ( )-(r)-enantiomer
(cushny, 1926). in spite of this old knowledge, synthetic
congeners of adrenaline were developed and used as racemates throughout during the 20th century. for technical and
economic reasons, full-scale production of pure enantiomers
was not judged feasible. whenever tested in laboratory scale
it was found, with few exceptions, that the bronchodilating
property of new, synthetic h-adrenoceptor agonists stayed
with the ( )-(r)-enantiomer, as shown for salbutamol
(hartley and middlemiss, 1971) and terbutaline (wetterlin,
1972), and that the presence of the (+)-(s)-enantiomer did
not appear to interfere (brittain et al., 1973; jeppsson et al.,
1984). to that comes that the toxicological documentation
did not give a hint on effects unrelated to stimulation of hadrenoceptors.
a more complex situation arises when a drug has two or
three chiral centres enabling four and eight stereo-isomers,
respectively. in those cases, a diastereomer pair has usually
been selected for development since diastereomers are more
easily separated than are enantiomers. thus  xxxd2155xxx  is a
racemic mixture of the highly potent (r,r)-enantiomer and a
virtually inactive (s,s)-enantiomer as demonstrated in vitro
(trofast et al., 1991) as well as in vivo (fozard and
buescher, 2001).  xxxd2391xxx  and  xxxd3017xxx  comprise racemic mixtures of an active (1r,2s)-enantiomer and a less
active (1s,2r)-enantiomer (mardle et al., 1974; yoshizaki et
al., 1977) the native compound, ephedrine with its two
chiral carbon atoms has the (1r,2s)-configuration (patil et
al., 1970).
in recent years, a suspicion has been raised that the
(s)-enantiomer of racemic h2-adrenoceptor agonists may
cause airway hyper-reactivity and even contribute to
increase in asthma death (handley et al., 1998). this
suspicion was originally based on experiments on guineapigs showing increased reactivity to the asthma-mediator

histamine after treatment with (s)-enantiomers of  xxxd2398xxx , salbutamol or terbutaline (sanjar and morley,
1988; mazzoni et al., 1994). these and some other
preclinical observations, which have been reviewed in
depth elsewhere (waldeck, 1999), led to the development
of the pure (r)-enantiomer of salbutamol (levalbuterol)
which was introduced to the us market recently. the
weighed clinical evidence obtained with levalbuterol so
far does not indicate a significant advantage of (r)salbutamol to the racemate (waldeck, 1999; lötvall et
al., 2001; ahrens and weinberger, 2001). if, however, a
new h2-adrenoceptor agonist with improved antiasthmatic
properties should appear, the pure active enantiomer
ought to be developed.
while there may be reasons to continue using a well
established h2-adrenoceptor agonist in racemic form for the
treatment of asthma, there is no excuse to use racemates in
experimental pharmacology when pure enantiomers are
available. as a matter of fact, enantiomer pairs are valuable
experimental tools in receptor pharmacology. furthermore,
there is a great variability in metabolism between enantiomers of h2-adrenoceptor agonists (nyberg, 1997) and this
may cause problems in the interpretation of pharmacokinetic
data (ariëns, 1984). to use racemates of h-adrenoceptor
agonists without mention of their chiral state and the
implication thereof is both ignorant and misleading (waldeck, 1993).

10. hybride drugs
while the main-stream development of h-adrenoceptor
agonists has been to increase their selectivity towards a
single receptor, some effort has been made to find molecules
with multiple effects other than those exerted by adrenaline.
one such attempt was reproterol, which is a phenylethanolamine linked to theophylline via a propyl chain (habersang
et al., 1977). in clinical practice, reproterol proved to be
nothing else than another h2-selective adrenoceptor agonist
and has not been able to compete with the pioneer compounds, salbutamol and terbutaline. another approach to
incorporate a second pharmacologic property is the dual
dopamine d2-receptor and h2-adrenoceptor agonist arc68397aa (fig. 4), also known as viozanr (bonnert et
al., 1998). the rationale is the combination of the bronchodilating activity of a h2-adrenoceptor agonist with the
sensory afferent modulating effect of a dopamine d2-receptor agonist in one and the same molecule. this combination
is a new approach to the management of copd (newbold et
al., 2001). however, the role of dopamine in the lung
remains to be established. it is worth noting that the
benzothizol structure of the synthetic compound arc68397aa was subsequently found to occur in the natural
h2-adrenoceptor agonist, s1319 (suzuki et al., 1999a). a
retrospective finding is that the h2-adrenoceptor agonist,
 xxxd2155xxx  has an inherent anticholinergic component

fig. 4. h-adrenoceptor agonists with a six-carbon atom (or the equivalent)
‘‘spacer arm’’ connecting the basic h-agonist structure (to the left) with a
‘‘carrier molecule’’ (to the right).

(teschemacher et al., 1998), but only in very high concentrations.

11. carrier molecules and spacer arms
in the foregoing, we have met some phenylethanolamine
derivatives such as hexoprenaline and salmeterol which
have a substituted aryl ring linked to the amino group via
a linear carbon chain (fig. 4). ar-c68397aa is designed in
a similar way (bonnert et al., 1998). this molecular construction has been explored more systematically by jacobson et al. (1983). they synthetised a number of derivatives
of  xxxd2398xxx , characterized by an extension of the nisopropyl group by a linear alkyl chain of varying length,
terminated by a substituted amide function, for example ptrifluoromethyl anilide (fig. 4). it was found that the length
of the alkyl chain, or ‘‘spacer arm’’, was critical for high
agonistic activity, six carbon atoms usually being optimal.
with this prerequisite a wide variation in the amide substituent or ‘‘carrier molecule’’ was possible and highly
active h-adrenoceptor agonists were found with both aryl
rings (rosenkranz et al., 1983a) and oligopeptides (rosenkranz et al., 1983b). this basic design of a h-adrenoceptor
agonist opens for unlimited possibilities to modify pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the product.
with multiple stereoisomers the variability is further
increased (eimerl et al., 1987).

12. future development and the medical need
we have made a journey starting with adrenaline and
ending with new, unexplored opportunities. one hundred
years of experience of structural modifications of the adrenaline molecule has shown that the possibilities to modify

b. waldeck / european journal of pharmacology 445 (2002) 1–12

pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of this
endogenous prototype appear to be unlimited. thus the
duration of the bronchodilatory action may be further
increased, the systemic side effects reduced using the ‘‘soft
drug principle’’, and additional pharmacophores may be built
into the molecule. the only limits set for the development of
an anti-asthma h-adrenoceptor agonist with a new product
profile are the medical need and marketing opportunities.
