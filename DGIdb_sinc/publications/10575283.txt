cannabinoid receptors ´ anandamide ´ tetrahydrocannabinol ´ marinol ´ nabilone ´ sr141716a ´ multiple sclerosis ´ chronic pain ´ appetite disorders ´ schizophrenia

it is now known that there are at least two types of cannabinoid receptors. these are cb1 receptors, present mainly on central and peripheral neurones, and cb2 receptors, present mainly on immune cells.
endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists (`endocannabinoids')
have also been identified. the discovery of this `endogenous cannabinoid system' has led to the development of selective cb1 and cb2 receptor ligands and fuelled renewed interest in the clinical potential of
cannabinoids. two  xxxg479xxx  agonists are already
used clinically, as antiemetics or as appetite stimulants. these are d9tetrahydrocannabinol (thc) and nabilone. other possible uses for
 xxxg479xxx  agonists include the suppression of muscle spasm/spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, the relief
of chronic pain and the management of glaucoma and bronchial asthma.  xxxg479xxx  antagonists may also have clinical applications, e. g.
as appetite suppressants and in the management of schizophrenia or
disorders of cognition and memory. so too may cb2 receptor ligands
and drugs that activate cannabinoid receptors indirectly by augmenting endocannabinoid levels at cannabinoid receptors. when taken
orally, thc seems to undergo variable absorption and to have a narrow `therapeutic window' (dose range in which it is effective without
producing significant unwanted effects). this makes it difficult to predict an oral dose that will be both effective and tolerable to a patient
and indicates a need for better cannabinoid formulations and modes
of administration. for the therapeutic potential of cannabis or  xxxg479xxx  agonists to be fully exploited, it will be important to establish
objectively and conclusively (a) whether these agents have efficacy
against selected symptoms that is of clinical significance and, if so,
whether the benefits outweigh the risks, (b) whether cannabis has
therapeutic advantages over individual cannabinoids, (c) whether
there is a need for additional drug treatments to manage any of the
disorders against which cannabinoids are effective, and (d) whether it
will be possible to develop drugs that have reduced psychotropic activity and yet retain the ability to act through cb1 receptors to produce
their sought-after effects.

cannabis und cannabinoide: pharmakologie und rationale fuèr die klinische anwendung
es ist nun bekannt, dass es wenigstens zwei typen von cannabinoidrezeptoren gibt. dies sind die cb1-rezeptoren, die vor allem auf zentralen und peripheren neuronen gefunden werden, sowie die uèberwiegend auf immunzellen auftretenden cb2-rezeptoren. endogene
cannabinoid-rezeptoragonisten
(«endocannabinoide»)
wurden
ebenfalls identifiziert. die entdeckung dieses «endogenen cannbinoid-systems» hat zur entwicklung selektiver cb1- und cb2-rezeptorliganden gefuèhrt und das erneute interesse am klinischen potential
der cannabinoide angeheizt. zwei cannabinoid-cb1-rezeptoragonisten werden bereits klinisch eingesetzt, als antiemetika und appetitanreger. es sind dies d9-tetrahydrocannabinol (thc) und  xxxd2687xxx .
weitere moègliche verwendungsmoèglichkeiten von cb1-rezeptoragonisten umfassen die unterdruèckung von muskelspasmen/-spastizitaèt
bei multipler sklerose oder ruèckenmarkserkrankungen, die linderung
chronischer schmerzen und die behandlung von glaukom und bronchialasthma. cb1-rezeptorantagonisten koènnten ebenfalls klinisch
eingesetzt werden, zum beispiel zur unterdruèckung des appetits sowie zur behandlung von schizophrenie oder stoèrungen von kognition
und gedaèchtnis. dies gilt ebenso fuèr cb2-rezeptorliganden und substanzen, die cannabinoid-rezeptoren indirekt aktivieren, indem sie
die endocannabinoid-konzentration an den cannabinoid-rezeptoren
erhoèhen. bei oraler aufnahme scheint thc variabel absorbiert zu werden und ein enges «therapeutisches fenster» zu besitzen (dosisbreite,
in der es effektiv ist, ohne signifikante unerwuènschte wirkungen hervorzurufen). das erschwert die voraussage einer dosis, die sowohl effektiv als auch fuèr den patienten tolerabel sein wird, und zeigt einen
bedarf fuèr bessere cannabinoid-zubereitungen und formen der applikation an. fuèr die vollstaèndige nutzung des therapeutischen potentials von cannabis oder cb1-rezeptoragonisten wird es wichtig sein,
objektiv und schluèssig festzustellen, (a) ob diese mittel eine wirksamkeit gegen bestimmte symptome besitzen, die von klinischer relevanz ist, und, wenn das so ist, ob die vorteile die risiken uèberwiegen,
(b) ob cannabis individuellen cannabinoiden therapeutisch uèberlegen ist, (c) ob bei stoèrungen, bei denen cannabinoide wirksam sind,
ein bedarf fuèr zusaètzliche medikamentoèse behandlungsformen besteht und (d), ob es moèglich sein wird, medikamente zu entwickeln,
die eine verringerte psychotrope aktivitaèt aufweisen und ihre faèhigkeit bewahren, zur erzielung ihrer gewuènschten wirkungen uèber spezifische cb1-rezeptoren zu wirken.

the plant cannabis sativa is the source of a set of more than 60
oxygen-containing aromatic hydrocarbon compounds called cannabinoids. one of these, d9-tetrahydrocannabinol (d9-thc), is responsible for most of the psychotropic properties of cannabis [1]. it
is also of interest because it is one of just two cannabinoids that is
licensed for medical use. thus d9-thc, as the oral preparation
 xxxd1943xxx  (marinolò, roxane laboratories inc., columbus, oh,
usa), is available in the usa for the suppression of nausea and
vomiting provoked by anticancer drugs and for the reversal,
through appetite stimulation, of body weight loss experienced by
aids patients. the other cannabinoid that is permissible to use
clinically is nabilone (cesamettm, cambridge laboratories, newcastle upon tyne, uk), a synthetic analogue of d9-thc that is also
given orally. this compound is licensed for use in the uk, again to
suppress nausea and vomiting produced by anticancer drugs.
because psychotropic cannabinoids have high lipid solubility and
low water solubility, they were long thought to owe their pharmacological properties to an ability to perturb the phospholipid constituents of biological membranes [1]. however, all this changed
with the discovery of specific cannabinoid receptors. these are
cb1 receptors, cloned in 1990, and cb2 receptors, cloned in 1993
[2]. both of these receptor types are coupled through gi/o proteins,
negatively to adenylate cyclase and positively to mitogen-activated
protein kinase. cb1 receptors are also coupled to ion channels
through gi/o proteins, negatively to n-type and p/q-type calcium
channels and positively to a-type and inwardly rectifying potassium channels. under certain conditions, cb1 receptors may also
activate adenylate cyclase through gs proteins [3]. other effector
mechanisms have also been proposed [2]. cb1 receptors are found
mainly on neurones in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system where they can inhibit neurotransmitter release when
activated. they exist in particularly high concentrations in the basal ganglia and in parts of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.
the physiological roles of cb2 receptors, which occur principally
in immune cells, are proving more difficult to establish. however,
it seems likely that these receptors modulate immune function in
health and/or disease, raising the possibility that cannabinoid receptor ligands may be effective not only in treating symptoms of
multiple sclerosis (see below), but also against its underlying
causes. the discovery of cb1 receptors in 1990 was followed by the
demonstration, in 1992, that mammalian tissues can produce agonists for these receptors. the most important of these `endocannabinoids' are arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, both of which are thought to serve as neurotransmitters [1, 2]. current knowledge about endocannabinoid
biosynthesis, release and fate is detailed elsewhere [4, 5]. cannabinoid cb1 and cb2 receptors and endocannabinoids together constitute the `endocannabinoid system'.
these recent advances in our understanding of cannabinoid pharmacology have prompted the development both of selective cb1
and cb2 receptor agonists and antagonists [2, 6] and of drugs that
inhibit the tissue uptake or metabolism of endocannabinoids [1, 7].
the most important antagonists to have been developed are the
cb1-selective agent, sr141716a, and the cb2-selective agent,

sr144528 [6]. when administered by themselves, sr141716a and
sr144528 produce effects in some biological systems that are opposite in direction to those produced by cannabinoid receptor agonists [2]. these `inverse cannabimimetic effects' are presumably
provoked in biological systems in which the endocannabinoid system is tonically active [7]. agonists with the greatest selectivity for
cb1 receptors have so far all proved to be anandamide analogues,
e. g. methanandamide [1, 8]. important cb2-selective agonists include l759633 and l759656 [9]. of the three cannabinoid receptor
agonists that have been most commonly used as pharmacological
tools, win55212-2, shows some degree of cb2 selectivity (up to
30-fold) [7], whereas cp55940 and d9-thc bind equally well to
cb1 and cb2 receptors [7, 8].
the discovery of the endocannabinoid system has been paralleled
by a growing interest in the possibility that cannabinoid receptor ligands may have therapeutic applications in addition to those of
anti-emesis and appetite stimulation (see above).  xxxg479xxx  antagonists could prove to be of value as appetite suppressants, in the
management of acute schizophrenia and/or for ameliorating cognitive/memory dysfunctions associated with disorders such as alzheimer's disease [6, 10±12].  xxxg479xxx  agonists have several potential therapeutic uses. among these are the management of glaucoma, bronchial asthma and pain and the suppression of muscle
spasticity/spasm associated with conditions such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury [13, 14]. an answer to the question of
whether drugs that activate or block cb2 receptors have therapeutic potential, e. g. as  xxxd371xxx , must await a more complete characterization of this component of the endocannabinoid
system. in some instances it may be of therapeutic advantage to
administer drugs that activate the endogenous cannabinoid system
indirectly by selectively inhibiting the tissue uptake or metabolism
of endocannabinoids so as to increase the levels of these compounds at cannabinoid receptors. such drugs should be more selective than direct cannabinoid receptor agonists as they are unlikely
to affect all parts of the endocannabinoid system at one time, producing instead effects only at sites where on-going production of
endogenous cannabinoids is taking place. not all effects of cannabinoids are mediated by receptors, and some of these may also
have clinical applications. of particular importance is evidence
from whole animal and tissue experiments that the psychotropically inactive cannabinoid, (+)-11-hydroxy-d8-thc-dimethylheptyl (hu-211, dexanabinol) is effective against neuropathic pain
and protects from neurotoxic changes in the brain arising, e. g.,
from ischaemia [15].
for cannabis and cannabinoid receptor agonists, there is particularly strong evidence to warrant the setting up of clinical trials that
will test the efficacy of these agents against the muscle spasticity/
spasm and chronic pain of multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury
[13, 14]. this evidence falls essentially into 3 categories: preclinical,
clinical and anecdotal.
(a) preclinical data. there are reports that the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist, win55212-2, can decrease the severity
of dystonia in mutant syrian hamsters with primary generalized dystonia and that, in rats and guinea pigs, d8- or d9-thc

can delay the onset and reduce the intensity of the signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a putative animal
model of multiple sclerosis [16±18]. other animal experiments
have shown that cannabinoid receptor agonists suppress spinal
reflexes and that they can produce hypokinesia and catalepsy,
changes in motor function that are presumably mediated at
least in part by the large populations of cannabinoid cb1 receptors present in the basal ganglia of the brain [1, 2, 19].
whether cannabinoids produce their putative antispasticity effect by acting at these brain sites remains to be established.
results from experiments with various animal models of pain
also suggest that cannabinoid receptor agonists can act through
central and/or peripheral cannabinoid cb1 receptors to suppress behavioural responses to various kinds of pain, including
hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain [20±28].
(b) clinical data. there have so far been 7 clinical investigations,
albeit with rather small numbers of patients [14]. the resulting
data suggest that cannabis, d9-thc or nabilone can reduce the
intensity of at least some signs and symptoms of multiple
sclerosis or spinal cord injury, particularly spasticity, pain, tremor and nocturia [29±35]. there is also clinical evidence that
cannabinoids can relieve other types of pain. for example,
double-blind, placebo controlled trials have shown oral d9thc to suppress continuous moderate cancer pain [36, 37]
and intramuscular l-nantradol to be effective against acute
postoperative pain [38].
(c) anecdotal data. among these are the responses to a questionnaire by 112 multiple sclerosis patients who claim to self-medicate with cannabis [39]. of the patients in this survey with the
following symptoms, over 90% reported improvement after
taking cannabis: spasticity at sleep onset (96.5%), pain in muscles (95.1%), spasticity when waking at night (93.2%), pain in
legs at night (92.3%), tremor of arms/head (90.7%), and depression (90.6%).
like most drugs, cannabinoids can induce adverse effects [13, 14,
40]. among these are impairment of cognitive function and memory, including difficulty in concentrating and thinking, reductions
in psychomotor coordination and performance, and changes in
autonomic, endocrine and reproductive function [40±44]. cardiovascular changes are also induced, particularly tachycardia, postural hypotension and supine hypertension [40, 45]. as a result, patients with coronary arteriosclerosis or congestive heart failure
should not take psychotropic cannabinoids. associated with these
effects of cannabinoids may be dysphoria, anxiety, panic reactions
and even psychoses [40, 42, 46]. consequently, it would be unwise
to give psychotropic cannabinoids to patients with schizophrenia
(overt or latent). tolerance to many of the pharmacological effects
of cannabinoids can be induced in animals and man [40, 47±49].
however, the extent to which tolerance develops to the soughtafter effects of cannabinoids when these are administered at thera-

14

forsch komplementaèrmed 1999;6(suppl 3):12±15

peutic dose levels has still to be determined. withdrawal of cannabis or of psychotropic cannabinoid administration can precipitate
abstinence signs in man. however, these signs are both transient
and mild and their significance when cannabinoids are used clinically is still unknown [40, 47±49]. the clinical significance of the
ability of cannabinoids to retard foetal development and to induce
foetal resorption in animals also remains to be established [40]. because of the tars produced during the combustion process, cannabis
smoke may be carcinogenic and can also injure the bronchial mucosa, decrease airway conductance and impair antibacterial activity
of alveolar macrophages [40, 50].
in conclusion, there is sufficient evidence to warrant additional
clinical studies with cannabis and/or cannabinoid receptor agonists.
these should be directed at establishing objectively and conclusively whether cannabinoids do indeed have efficacy against selected symptoms that is of clinical significance and, if they do,
whether the benefits outweigh the risks. there is also a need to establish whether mixtures of cannabinoids have any therapeutic advantages over individual cannabinoids, there being some evidence
that, in addition to d9-thc, other constituents of cannabis contribute to its putative beneficial effects either directly or indirectly
[15]. another important need is for strategies that will selectively
reduce the psychotropic effects of cannabinoids [15]. also required
is further basic research directed at characterizing the pharmacology and physiology of both cb1 and cb2 components of the endocannabinoid system more fully. this in turn may reveal additional
therapeutic applications for cannabinoids. the question of whether
there are other cannabinoid receptor types/subtypes also needs to
be addressed [51]. last but not least, there seems to be a need for
additional formulations and modes of administration for cannabinoids. thus, when taken orally, d9-thc seems to undergo a somewhat variable absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and to
have a rather narrow `therapeutic window' (dose range in which it
is effective without producing significant unwanted effects). in one
clinical study, for example d9-thc was effective in one multiple
sclerosis patient at an oral dose of 5 mg, whilst in a second multiple
sclerosis patient it was effective only when the dose was raised to
15 mg (both 5 and 10 mg d9-thc were ineffective in this patient)
[29]. in another clinical study in which multiple sclerosis patients
were given d9-thc or placebo orally, both 2.5 and 5 mg d9-thc
were ineffective in producing subjective relief from spasticity,
7.5 mg was effective and 10 mg was intolerable to some of the patients [31]. potential alternatives to the oral route include cannabinoid administration by rectal suppository [30], by aerosol/vapour
inhalation [52±54] or by skin patch, all modes of administration
that avoid first-pass metabolism of the absorbed drug. other possibilities are direct application to the eye (for glaucoma) or spinal
cord, use of the sublingual route and slow-release oral cannabinoid
formulation.
