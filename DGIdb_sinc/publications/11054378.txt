background & aims: activation of nf-␬b/rel has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
disease (ibd). various drugs used in the treatment of
ibd, such as glucocorticoids,  xxxd2579xxx , and
 xxxd3255xxx , interfere with nf-␬b/rel signaling. the
aim of this study was to define the molecular mechanism by which  xxxd3255xxx  inhibits nf-␬b activation.
methods: the effects of  xxxd3255xxx  and its moieties
on nf-␬b signaling were evaluated using electromobility
shift, transfection, and immune complex kinase assays.
the direct effect of  xxxd3255xxx  on i␬b kinase (ikk)
activity was investigated using purified recombinant
ikk-␣ and -␤ proteins. results: nf-␬b/rel activity induced by  xxxg2296xxx  ␣,  xxxd2925xxx , or overexpression of nf-␬b–inducing kinase, ikk-␣, ikk-␤, or constitutively active ikk-␣
and ikk-␤ mutants was inhibited dose dependently by
 xxxd3255xxx .  xxxd3255xxx  inhibited tumor necrosis
factor ␣–induced activation of endogenous ikk in jurkat
t cells and sw620 colon cells, as well as the catalytic
activity of purified ikk-␣ and ikk-␤ in vitro. in contrast,
the moieties of  xxxd3255xxx ,  xxxd2579xxx , and
sulfapyridine or 4- xxxd153xxx  had no effect. activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (erk) 1
and 2, c-jun-n-terminal kinase (jnk) 1, and p38 was
unaffected by  xxxd3255xxx . the decrease in substrate
phosphorylation by ikk-␣ and -␤ is associated with a
decrease in autophosphorylation of ikks and can
be antagonized by excess  xxxd83xxx .
conclusions: these data identify  xxxd3255xxx  as a direct inhibitor of ikk-␣ and -␤ by antagonizing adenosine
triphosphate binding. the suppression of nf-␬b activation by inhibition of the ikks contributes to the wellknown anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of  xxxd3255xxx .

nflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is characterized by
aberrant expression of proinflammatory genes, which
can be induced by cytokines such as  xxxg2296xxx 
(tnf) and interleukin (il)-1.1 one major downstream
target of tnf-␣ and il-1 is nf-␬b/rel. binding sites
for this transcription factor are found in promoter/
enhancer regions of various genes such as cytokines

i

or adhesion molecules.2,3 constitutively active nuclear
rela(p65) was detected in epithelial cells and macrophages of patients with ibd.4 in mice, administration of
antisense oligonucleotides to rela(p65) abrogates experimental colitis.5
nf-␬b/rel is mostly composed of rela(p65) and
nf-␬b1(p50) subunits. in unstimulated cells, these nf␬b/rel dimers are kept in an inactive cytoplasmic complex by inhibitory proteins, termed i␬bs.2,3 stimulation
with tnf-␣, il-1, or other cytokines induces i␬b phosphorylation, leading to ubiquitination and degradation
of i␬b by a proteasome-dependent pathway.6 subsequently free, active nf-␬b/rel complexes translocate
into the nucleus to transactivate their target genes. two
closely related i␬b kinases, termed ikk-␣ and ikk-␤,
isolated from cytosolic extracts specifically phosphorylate
i␬b␣ on serines 32 and 36.7 whereas ikk-␤ is essential
for full activation of nf-␬b/rel by tnf-␣ and il-1␤,
the role of ikk-␣ is less well defined. cells derived from
ikk-␣– deficient mice show no impairment of nf-␬b/
rel activation by either tnf-␣ or il-1␤.8 taken together, the ikk complex represents a key element in the
nf-␬b/rel signaling because it controls nuclear translocation of nf-␬b/rel. furthermore, there is strong
evidence that ikk-␣ and ikk-␤ are themselves activated by upstream-activating kinases such as nf-␬b–
inducing kinase (nik) or mekk1.9
various drugs such as glucocorticoids and salicylates
have been shown to inhibit the activation of nf-␬b/
rel.10 –12 we have previously shown that  xxxd3255xxx 
inhibits the activation of the transcription factor nf-␬b/
rel by tnf-␣ in colonic epithelial cells.13 we now

identify the molecular mechanism of  xxxd3255xxx -mediated inhibition of nf-␬b/rel.  xxxd3255xxx  inhibits
tnf-␣–,  xxxd2925xxx  (tpa)–,
nik–, ikk-␣–, and ikk-␤–induced nf-␬b/rel– dependent transcriptional activity. moreover,  xxxd3255xxx 
blocked tnf-␣–induced activation of cellular ikk-␣/
ikk-␤ as well as the activity of recombinant ikk-␣ and
ikk-␤ in vitro.

materials and methods
cell culture and treatments
jurkat t cells were grown in rpmi, and sw620
colonic epithelial cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified
eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2
mmol/l glutamine, and 1% (wt/vol) penicillin/streptomycin.
recombinant human tnf-␣, tpa,  xxxd3255xxx , 4- xxxd153xxx  (4-asa),  xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ), sulfapyridine, and  xxxd234xxx  (aspirin, asa) were purchased
from sigma (deisenhofen, germany).  xxxd3255xxx , 4-asa,
 xxxd2579xxx , sulfapyridine, and aspirin were dissolved in culture
medium or  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) immediately before
usage. the ph of media after addition of the various compounds was between 7.2 and 7.4.

plasmids
the 3⫻ig␬bluc reporter plasmid contains 3 ␬b
sites.13 expression vectors for nik, ha-ikk-␣, ha-ikk-␤,
ha-ikk-ee␣, ha-ikk-ee␤, and gst-i␬b␣ (1-54), and
gst-i␬b␣ (1-54, s32a,s36a) were generously provided by
m. karin (san diego, ca).6

electrophoretic mobility shift assays
nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described
previously.13 protein concentrations were determined by the
method of bradford (bio-rad laboratories, munich, germany). electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as
described previously13 using the ␬b motif of the mouse immunoglobulin (ig) ␬ light chain enhancer as probe.

transfections and luciferase assays
sw620 cells (2 ⫻ 105) were transfected in 35-mmdiameter culture dishes with 5 mg of 3⫻ig␬bluc reporter
plasmid containing 3 ␬b sites or the control plasmid13 along
with expression plasmids for nik, ha-ikk-␣, ha-ikk-␤,
ha-ikk-ee␣, ha-ikk-ee␤, or empty vector, as indicated
by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. jurkat t
cells (107) were electroporated in a total volume of 300 ml of
rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum.
electroporations were performed with a gene pulser ii apparatus (bio-rad) at 260 v and 975 mf in 40-mm electroporation cuvettes. eighteen hours after transfection, the medium
was changed to medium containing inhibitors or control medium. after 30 minutes, cells were stimulated with tnf-␣ or

gastroenterology vol. 119, no. 5

tpa. after an 18-hour incubation period, cells were harvested
and lysed in 100 ml of buffer containing 25 mmol/l tris-hcl
(ph 7.8), 2 mmol/l edta, 2 mmol/l dithiothreitol (dtt),
10% glycerol, and 1% triton x-100 for 10 minutes at room
temperature. lysates were centrifuged at 7000g for 5 minutes.
luciferase activity of at least 4 independent transfections with
20 ml cleared lysate was determined in an lb 9501 luminometer (berthold, bad wildbad, germany) using a luciferase assay
system (promega, mannheim, germany). all transfections were
normalized for the level of total cellular protein (bradford assay;
bio-rad). transfections were performed in triplicate.

detection of active extracellular signalrelated kinase 1 and 2, c-jun-n-terminal
kinase 1, and p38 by western blot analysis
jurkat t cells or sw620 colon cells were starved
overnight in medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. cells
were stimulated with tnf-␣ (150 u/ml) or tpa (10 ng/ml)
and 10% fetal calf serum, as previously described.14 thirty
minutes before stimulation,  xxxd3255xxx  was added to the
medium at the indicated concentrations. cells were washed
twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and lysed in
laemmli buffer.15 the lysate was boiled for 5 minutes at 95°c
and passed through a 21-gauge needle to dissolve residual
genomic dna. lysates were cleared by centrifugation and
subjected to  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (schleicher & schuell, dassel, germany)
by semidry electroblotting. membranes were blocked with
pbs containing 2% bovine  xxxg124xxx  for 1 hour at 37°c.
membranes were probed with antibodies specific for phosphorylated erk, c-jun-n-terminal kinase ( jnk) 1, or p38 as
indicated (promega). bands were visualized using horseradish
peroxidase–labeled secondary antibodies ( jackson immunotech; dianova, hamburg, germany) and chemiluminescence
(ecl plus; amersham, braunschweig, germany). to determine the amount of total kinases, membranes were stripped
and reprobed with antisera against extracellular signal-related
kinase (erk),  xxxg1370xxx , and p38 (santa cruz, heidelberg, germany). bands were detected using horseradish peroxidase–
labeled protein a (amersham) and an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (amersham).

preparation of recombinant gst-i␬b␣
proteins from escherichia coli
e. coli-bl21 were transformed with wild-type gsti␬b␣ (1-54) or mutated gst-i␬b␣ (1-54, s32a,s36a), and
protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl ␤-dthiogalactoside for 4 hours at 30°c. bacterial pellets were
sonicated in pbs containing 1% triton x-100. gst fusion
proteins were precipitated using glutathione sepharose beads
(amersham). after elution from the beads, the i␬ba proteins
were dialyzed in 25 mmol/l hepes (ph 7.5), 150 mmol/l
nacl, and 10% glycerol. purity of eluted protein was ⬎95%
as judged by sds-page and coomassie staining of the gel.

immune complex kinase assay of the
endogenous ikk complex
after the indicated treatment, jurkat t cells or sw620
cells were lysed in tris lysis buffer containing 25 mmol/l
tris-hcl (ph 8.0), 150 mmol/l nacl, 50 mmol/l ␤-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/l egta, 1 mmol/l edta, 10% glycerol, 1% triton x-100, 5 mmol/l benzamidin, 1 mmol/l
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.4
mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmol/l dtt. lysates were clarified
by centrifugation, and immunoprecipitation was performed

twice in tris lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (25 mmol/l
hepes [ph 7.5], 150 mmol/l nacl, 25 mmol/l ␤-glycerolphosphate, and 10 mmol/l mgcl2). kinase reaction was performed in kinase buffer containing 1 mmol/l dtt and 500 ng
of recombinant gst-i␬b␣ (1-54) in the presence of 5 ␮ci
[␥32p] xxxd83xxx  (atp) for 20 minutes at 30°c.
reaction was stopped by addition of boiling laemmli buffer.15
immunoprecipitates were separated on sds-page and subsequently blotted on nitrocellulose. activity was quantified using a phosphorimager (fuji, frankfurt, germany) and visual-

u/ml for 30 minutes) (lanes 2– 6). cells were pretreated for 1 or 3 hours with 2 mmol/l  xxxd3255xxx  before stimulation with tnf-␣ (lanes 3
and 4). binding specificity was confirmed by incubation with a 100-fold of an unrelated oligonucleotide spanning an sp1 binding site (lane 6). the

ized using radiograph films. membranes were probed with
antibodies against ikk-␣ and ikk-␤ (santa cruz, heidelberg, germany). immunoprecipitated ikk-␣ and ikk-␤ were
detected using the appropriate secondary reagent and enhanced
chemiluminescence (amersham). under the above conditions,
both kinases were detectable in the immunoprecipitates.

in vitro ikk activation assay
recombinant ikk-␣ and ikk-␤ purified from sf9
cells (a generous gift of j. li, department of biology, boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals, ridgefield, ct)16 were incubated in kinase buffer containing 1 mmol/l dtt on ice for
5 minutes with the indicated agents dissolved in dmso.
kinase reaction was performed as described above. in competition experiments, the indicated concentrations of atp were
added to the reaction mixture at the same time as the inhibitor. proteins were separated by sds-page. integrity and
loading of ikks were controlled by coomassie staining. gels
were dried, and protein bands were cut out of the gels. activity
was determined in a scintillation counter (amersham, braunschweig). background phosphorylation was assessed using the
mutated gst-i␬b␣ (1-54, s32a,s36a) in the kinase reaction
(data not shown). activity of recombinant ikks as determined
by scintillation counting was blotted against concentration of
 xxxd3255xxx . the ic50 was determined as half of the maximal
inhibitory concentration.17

results
inhibition of nf-␬b/rel activation and ␬bdependent transcription in jurkat t cells
nf-␬b/rel activity of jurkat t cells induced by
tnf-␣ was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift
assay in the presence or absence of  xxxd3255xxx  (figure
1a). as previously described, tnf-␣ induced a strong
nf-␬b/rel– binding activity that was completely inhibited when cells were pretreated with 2 mmol/l  xxxd3255xxx  for 3 hours. this observation was confirmed in
luciferase assays using a ␬b-dependent reporter plasmid
(3⫻ig␬bluc). at a concentration of 2 mmol/l,  xxxd3255xxx  inhibited tnf-␣–induced ␬b-dependent transcription by 90% in jurkat t cells and sw620 colonic
epithelial cells (figure 1b and c). in addition,  xxxd3255xxx  inhibited tpa-induced ␬b-dependent transcription
(figure 1d).
 xxxd3255xxx  inhibits nik-induced ␬bdependent transcription
tnf-␣ signaling depends on the recruitment of
tnf receptor–associated proteins and nik to the cell
membrane, which then activates the ikk complex. to
determine the level at which the  xxxd3255xxx  inhibition
occurs, jurkat t cells or sw620 cells were transfected

figure 2.  xxxd3255xxx  inhibits nik-induced ␬b-dependent transcription. jurkat t cells (■) and sw620 colon cells ( ) were transfected
with 3⫻ig␬bluc and 200 ng of a nik expression vector and incubated
after 18 hours with either medium alone (co) or with  xxxd3255xxx 
(ss),  xxxd2579xxx , 4-asa, or sulfapyridine (sp) at 2 mmol/l. after another
18 hours, luciferase activity was determined. values are expressed

with an nik expression vector together with
3⫻ig␬bluc. increasing amounts of nik caused a strong
induction of luciferase activity (data not shown). luciferase activity was completely dependent on the presence
of ␬b sites because the control plasmid lacking the ␬b
elements did not respond to nik transfection (data not
shown). pretreatment with 2 mmol/l  xxxd3255xxx  decreased luciferase activity more than 50% in both cell
types (figure 2). in contrast, the  xxxd3255xxx  moieties
 xxxd2579xxx  and sulfapyridine or 4-asa did not affect luciferase activity at the doses tested.
 xxxd3255xxx , but not 4-asa,  xxxd2579xxx , or
sulfapyridine, inhibits ikk-␣– and ikk-␤–
induced ␬b-dependent transcription
because the ikk complex is a direct target of
nik, we tested the effect of  xxxd3255xxx  and its moieties
on the ikks. overexpression of either ha-ikk-␣ or
ha-ikk-␤ induced a strong concentration-dependent
increase of ␬b-dependent transcription (figure 3a and
b). consistent with earlier reports, the effect of ikk-␤ is
more pronounced.18 the increase in luciferase activity
was completely dependent on the presence of ␬b sites
(data not shown). luciferase activity induced by haikk-␣ and ha-ikk-␤ was inhibited by  xxxd3255xxx  at
a dose of 2 mmol/l (figure 3c and d). neither 4-asa,
 xxxd2579xxx , nor sulfapyridine had any effect on ikk-␣– or
ikk-␤–induced transactivation. these data are confirmed by overexpression experiments with constitutively
active mutants of ikk-␣ or ikk-␤.18 as for the wild

2 mmol/l (data not shown).
 xxxd3255xxx , but not 4-asa,  xxxd2579xxx , or
sulfapyridine, inhibits tnf-␣–induced
i␬b␣ phosphorylation
to investigate the effect of  xxxd3255xxx , 4-asa,
 xxxd2579xxx , or sulfapyridine on tnf-␣–induced activity of
endogenous ikk-␣/ikk-␤, an immune complex kinase
assay was performed. tnf-␣ treatment produced a
strong induction of endogenous ikk-␣/ikk-␤ activity,
peaking at 5 minutes as judged by gst-i␬b␣ phosphorylation. ikk-␣/ikk-␤ did not phosphorylate a substrate
mutated at serine residues 32 and 36 (data not shown).
the simultaneous addition of 2 mmol/l  xxxd3255xxx  and

tnf-␣ resulted in more than 80% inhibition of endogenous ikk-␣/ikk-␤ kinase activity in sw620 cells and
in a 50% reduction in jurkat t cells after 30 minutes
compared with cells treated only with tnf-␣ (figure
4a, c, d, and f ). 4-asa,  xxxd2579xxx , or  xxxd3255xxx  did
not inhibit i␬b kinase activity under these conditions.

before stimulation with tnf-␣, 150 u/ml for 30 minutes. (a and d) ikk-␣ and ikk-␤ were immunopurified from cell extracts, and kinase activity
was determined using gst-i␬b␣ (1-54) as substrate. (b and e ) immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blotting using an ikk antibody
recognizing ikk-␣ and ikk-␤. (c and f ) kinase activity was quantitated using a phosphorimager and plotted as percent activity. findings are
representative of 3 independent experiments.

using antibodies that recognized active (phosphorylated)
kinases. stimulation with tnf-␣ resulted in a moderate
increase in  xxxg1369xxx /2,  xxxg1370xxx , and p38 activity. treatment
of the cells with  xxxd3255xxx  at a concentration of 2

mmol/l had no significant effect on tnf-␣–induced
 xxxg1369xxx /2,  xxxg1370xxx , and p38 activation, indicating that  xxxd3255xxx  did not interfere with tnf-␣ signaling to
endogenous mitogen-activated protein and stress kinases
(figure 5).

 xxxd3255xxx  inhibits activity and
autophosphorylation of purified ikk-␣
and ikk-␤ kinase in vitro
recombinant ikk-␣ (figure 6a) or ikk-␤ (figure 6b) purified from sf9 cells was incubated with the
indicated concentrations of  xxxd3255xxx  in the presence
of [␥-32p]atp and gst-i␬b␣ (1-54) for 30 minutes. as
previously shown, ikk-␤ kinase activity is 40 –50-fold
higher than ikk-␣ activity.16 the activity of both kinases was inhibited by  xxxd3255xxx  at comparable doses.
the ic50 for ikk-␣ was calculated at ⬃210 mmol/l,
and the ic50 for ikk-␤ was ⬃170 mmol/l (figure 6).
 xxxd3255xxx , but not  xxxd2579xxx , sulfapyridine,
or aspirin, inhibits ikk-␣/ikk-␤
kinase activity
to test whether salicylates affect the catalytic
activity of purified ikk-␣ and ikk-␤, kinases were
incubated with dmso as control,  xxxd3255xxx ,  xxxd2579xxx ,
sulfapyridine, or aspirin at 1 mmol/l in the presence of
[␥-32p]atp and gst-i␬b␣ (1-54) for 30 minutes.  xxxd3255xxx  (1 mmol/l) strongly inhibited ikk-␣ activity,
whereas sulfapyridine and  xxxd2579xxx  did not show any effect

at that concentration (figure 7a). likewise, ikk-␤ activity was inhibited by  xxxd3255xxx  in a dose-dependent
fashion, and  xxxd2579xxx  and sulfapyridine were again ineffective (figure 7b). at the concentration of 1 mmol/l,
aspirin only marginally inhibited ikk-␣ and ikk-␤
activity.
 xxxd3255xxx -mediated inhibition of ikk-␣
and ikk-␤ activity in vitro is overcome by
increasing the atp concentration
to further elucidate the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3255xxx  on ikk activity, in vitro kinase assays were
performed in the presence of increasing atp concentrations. when  xxxd3255xxx  and atp were added simultaneously, excess atp could clearly overcome the inhibition of activity (figure 8).

discussion
most of the beneficial effects of salicylates such as
 xxxd3255xxx  are attributed to their inhibition of cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin h synthase; however, prostaglandin-independent effects, such as inhibition of the
transcription factor nf-␬b/rel, have been shown.10 we

previously demonstrated that  xxxd3255xxx  inhibits nf␬b/rel activation induced by tnf-␣, lipopolysaccharide, and tpa in a colonic epithelial cell line.13 the
molecular mechanism for this inhibition remained unclear. in this study, we provide evidence that  xxxd3255xxx  acts as a direct inhibitor of i␬b kinase activity by
competing for atp binding.
despite the relatively high concentrations needed for
ikk inhibition, we did not see any effect of  xxxd3255xxx 
on tnf-␣–induced activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2,  xxxg1370xxx , or p38.
these data show that tnf-␣ signaling to these kinases
is intact in the presence of  xxxd3255xxx , indicating that
in our system this compound does not interfere with the
binding of tnf-␣ to its receptor, as suggested by shanahan et al.19 we have shown in sw620 colon cells that
 xxxg1222xxx  activity assayed with a reporter gene also was not
affected by  xxxd3255xxx , even at concentrations up to 5
mmol/l.13 similarly, aspirin or salicylate treatment did
not influence the adenovirus early region 3 promoter,
which is activated by  xxxg1836xxx – dependent phosphorylation of camp-response element binding protein.20 our data show that  xxxd3255xxx  inhibits the
activation of nf-␬b/rel in different cell types after
various stimuli such as tnf-␣, tpa, and transfection of
nik. these stimuli converge at the level of the i␬bkinase complex, suggesting that i␬b kinases represent
the targets of  xxxd3255xxx . this suggestion is supported
by further studies showing that  xxxd3255xxx  inhibits
transactivation of nf-␬b/rel by transfected wild-type
ikk-␣ and -␤ as well as the gain-of-function mutants of
these kinases (figure 3a and b and c. k. weber and
r. m. schmid, unpublished observations, february
2000).
it has been suggested that the mechanism of nf-␬b/
rel inhibition by aspirin involves inhibition of ikk-␤
but not ikk-␣ activity.20 in agreement with yin et al.,20
we see a slight effect of aspirin on ikk-␤ activity;
however,  xxxd3255xxx  is a far more effective inhibitor.
furthermore,  xxxd3255xxx  is able to inhibit both ikk-␣
and ikk-␤ with a comparable ic50. the inhibition of
both ikk-␣ and ikk-␤ activity by  xxxd3255xxx  in vitro
can be overcome by increasing the atp concentration in
vitro. therefore,  xxxd3255xxx  is likely to compete with
atp binding. the michaelis constant (km) values of
ikk-␣ and ikk-␤ for atp are in the nanomolar range
and therefore are considerably lower than those of other
protein kinases.16 this low km might be responsible for
the relatively high concentration of  xxxd3255xxx  needed
to suppress the catalytic activity.

figure 8.  xxxd3255xxx -mediated inhibition of ikk-␣ and ikk-␤ activity
is blocked by increasing the atp concentration. recombinant (a )
ikk-␣ and (b) ikk-␤ were incubated with the indicated concentrations
of  xxxd3255xxx  and atp. kinase reaction was initiated by adding
recombinant gst-i␬b␣ (1-54) as substrate. parallel kinase reactions
were performed without the inhibitor. after 30 minutes, kinase reactions were stopped and proteins were separated by sds-page. gsti␬b␣ (1-54) bands were cut out, and activity was determined in a
scintillation counter. values obtained from kinase reactions with  xxxd3255xxx  without the addition of atp were set to 100%. inhibition of
ikk activity by  xxxd3255xxx  is expressed as the mean ⫾ sem of at
least 3 independent experiments.

the concentrations of  xxxd3255xxx  achieved in inflamed tissue are not known. however, intestinal concentrations in humans treated for ibd are in the millimolar range,21 suggesting that the high concentrations of
 xxxd3255xxx  required for the inhibition of nf-␬b/rel
through ikk in vitro can be achieved in vivo. our
findings on ikk inhibition by  xxxd3255xxx  are supported by clinical data showing that  xxxd3255xxx  is an

effective agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,
a disease in which the inhibition of nf-␬b/rel signaling
is an important therapeutic concept.22,23 although most
of orally administered  xxxd3255xxx  is cleaved into  xxxd2579xxx 
and sulfapyridine by enteric bacteria, patient studies
show that approximately 30% of  xxxd3255xxx  is resorbed
in the gut as an intact molecule. noncleaved  xxxd3255xxx  is concentrated in the synovial fluid of inflamed
joints, has a high affinity for connective tissue, and
accumulates in the intestinal lumen.24 –27 moreover,  xxxd3255xxx  is beneficial in patients with joint affection in
ibd. thus, we propose that the inhibition of ikk within
the cell contributes to the anti-inflammatory action of
 xxxd3255xxx  in vivo. clinical data support additional
mechanisms because  xxxd2579xxx  is as effective as  xxxd3255xxx 
for the treatment of ulcerative colitis but is not beneficial
for rheumatoid arthritis.24,28 interestingly,  xxxd2579xxx , a
derivative of  xxxd2579xxx , inhibits il-1–stimulated phosphorylation of rela(p65) but does not affect the degradation
of i␬b␣.29 however, the inhibition of ikk has been
proposed as a potential mechanism through which
 xxxd2579xxx  blocks tnf-␣–stimulated phosphorylation and
degradation of i␬b␣.30,31 our data are in contrast with
these findings and show that  xxxd2579xxx  does not inhibit the
activity of recombinant ikk, even at millimolar concentrations. although we cannot explain these discrepancies,
our data provide additional insight into the molecular
mechanism because we show that  xxxd3255xxx  competes
with atp for binding to both i␬b kinases.
this study provides evidence that some of the antiinflammatory action of  xxxd3255xxx  in vivo might be
attributable to its direct inhibition of the ikk complex,
a key regulator of nf-␬b/rel activation. for treatment
of ibd, it would be interesting to test whether derivatives of  xxxd3255xxx  that are not subject to cleavage
would be more effective. therefore,  xxxd3255xxx  represents a promising basis for drug development.
