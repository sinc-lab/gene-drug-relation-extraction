abstract
apomorphine, the catechol-derived dopamine d1/ xxxg656xxx  agonist, is currently in use as an antiparkinsonian drug. it has
previously been reported that apomorphine was able to elicit expression of the enzyme  xxxg2276xxx , a marker for da
neurons, in the fetal rat cerebrocortical cultures whilst in the presence of  xxxg259xxx . the present study
demonstrated that treatment of fetal rat ventral mesencephalic cultures with apomorphine caused a marked increase in the
number of dopaminergic neurons. the action of apomorphine can be mimicked by dopamine receptor (d1 and d2) agonists or
blocked by preincubation with d1/ xxxg656xxx  antagonists. incubation of recipient mesencephalic cultures with the conditioned
medium derived from apomorphine-stimulated donor mesencephalic cultures elicited a 3.72-fold increase in the number of thpositive neurons. increased mrna expression levels of  xxxg259xxx  and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor were also found in the apomorphine-treated mesencephalic cells along with concomitant protein expression increases in
the conditioned medium. moreover, the trophic activity observed could be partially neutralized by antibodies against either brainderived  xxxg1614xxx  or  xxxg882xxx . cultured fetal striatal cells, but not hippocampal cells, also
responded to apomorphine treatment. the membrane ®ltration studies revealed that both <30 kda and >50 kda fractions
contained trophic activities. the latter characterization distinguishes them from most known neurotrophic factors. these results
suggest that the apomorphine-modulated development of dopaminergic neurons may be mediated by activation of the dopamine
receptor subtypes d1 and d2 thereby increasing the production of multiple growth factors.

introduction
parkinson's disease is characterized by progressive dopaminergic
(da) neuronal cell death in the substantia nigra, resulting in severe
motor de®cits. several lines of evidence have suggested that many
substances including growth factors support the survival and/or
differentiation of dopaminergic neurons both in vitro and in vivo.
these include  xxxg259xxx  (bdnf),  xxxg259xxx -4 (nt-4), ®broblast growth factor (fgf)-1,  xxxg787xxx , plateletderived growth factor (pdgf), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor (gdnf) and various cytokines (engele et al., 1991; hama
et al., 1991; hyman et al., 1991; lin et al., 1993; hyman et al., 1994;
zhou et al., 1994). more recently, additional neurotrophic factors of
the gdnf family have been discovered. neurturin was puri®ed from
conditioned medium from chinese hamster ovary cells using an assay
based on its ability to promote the survival of sympathetic neurons in
culture (kotzbauer et al., 1996). persephin was discovered by a
cloning protocol using degenerate primer pcr with genomic dna as
a template (milbrandt et al., 1998). artemin was identi®ed, by
searching dna databases (baloh et al., 1998). like gdnf, neurturin,
persephin and artemin are survival factors for mesencephalic da
correspondence. dr jiawei zhou, as above.

neurons as well as for other neuronal populations. moreover, other as
yet unidenti®ed trophic factors with survival-promoting effects on
da neurons have been reported (carvey et al., 1993; o'malley et al.,
1994; ling et al., 1998; zhou et al., 2000a). thus, understanding the
molecular mechanisms of action of known growth factors as well as
their regulation, and searching for novel neurotrophic factors are the
objects of considerable interest.
in previous studies on the induction of da neurotransmitter
phenotype in cultured fetal cerebrocortical cells, it was observed that
dopamine (10 mm) in combination with bdnf was able to elicit
expression of  xxxg2276xxx  (th), a marker for da neurons.
intriguingly, in the presence of bdnf, a tiny amount of exogenously
added apomorphine (apo, e.g. 1 nm) was as effective as 10 mm
dopamine (zhou et al., 1996). withdrawal of apo treatment,
however, resulted in rapid loss of expression of da phenotype in
those cortical cells, suggesting the supporting roles of apo in da
neurotransmitter phenotype or the survival of da neurons.
apo, the catechol-derived dopamine d1/ xxxg656xxx  agonist, is in
therapeutic use as an antiparkinsonian drug. apo has been shown to
be a highly potent iron chelator, a free-radical scavenger and an
inhibitor of membrane lipid peroxidation both in vitro and in vivo (for
review, see youdim et al., 1999). apo has also been implicated in
inhibition of brain and mitochondrial protein oxidation (youdim
et al., 1999). in vivo apo has been shown to protect against

mptp-induced striatal da neurodegeneration in mice (grunblatt
et al., 2001). the neuroprotection observed with apo does not seem
to be related to its da agonist properties, instead it appears to be due
to the antioxidant and free radical scavenging effects of the
compound. what exact role apo plays in the growth of mesencephalic da neurons has not yet been determined. in this study, it was
sought to determine whether apo has a supporting effect on the
cultured fetal da neurons. it was found that apo-treated conditioned
medium (cm) has trophic effects on da neurons in fetal
mesencephalic cultures, which may be mediated by bdnf, gdnf
and other neurotrophic molecules.

materials and methods
mesencephalic assay culture
all animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the
united states national institutes of health guide for the care and
use of laboratory animals. fetal ventral mesencephalons (vm) were
obtained at embryonic day 14 (e14, where e0 is the day of vaginal
plug) of gestation, immediately after the rats were killed with an
over-dose of  xxxd285xxx . the rat embryos were stored in ice-cold hank's
balanced saline solution (ca2+ and mg2+ free, hbss) until dissection.
after removal of meninges, the embryos were dissected out in hbss
and cut into 0.5 mm sections. following washing, the tissue was
incubated in hbss containing 25 mg/ml trypsin and 0.5 mg/ml
dnase at room temperature for 10 min. tissue was then sequentially
washed in hbss containing dnase.
rat mesencephalic cells were seeded into 96-well plates (nunc,
roskilde, denmark) precoated with poly l-lysine (10 mg/ml, sigma,
st. louis, mo, usa) as described previously (zhou et al., 1994). cell
viability in suspensions of dissociated cells was determined by the
ability of viable neurons to exclude the dye trypan blue. the cells
were plated at 105 viable cells/cm2 in dulbecco's modi®ed eagle's
medium (dmem, life technologies, gaithersburg, md, usa) and
ham's f12 (1 : 1), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (life
technologies). four hours later, cultures were switched to serum-free
conditions, i.e. dmem/ham's f12 (1 : 1) with addition of n2
(1 : 100, life technologies) and streptomycin/penicillin. it has been
well established that the growth of astroglia is greatly inhibited under
these conditions. apo-conditioned media and other molecules of
interest (e.g. bdnf, gdnf) were added immediately after the
medium was changed. total volume of culture medium was 100 ml
per well. cells were incubated at 37 °c in a 95% air/5% co2
humidi®ed atmosphere and maintained for 24 h after switching to
serum-free medium.

preparation of conditioned medium
to prepare the conditioned medium (cm), fetal ventral mesencephalic cells were plated on a poly l-lysine-coated 35 mm-diameter
dish (nunc) and were grown in dmem/f12 supplemented with n2 at
cell density of 3 3 105/cm2 for 3 or 6 days. during that time, the vm
cultures were treated twice with compound of interested, such as
apo (sigma), haloperidol (hal, sigma). the cm was collected and
centrifuged at 1000 g to remove cell debris. they were then aliquoted
and stored at ±80 °c until use. the cm derived from fetal striatal or
hippocampal cells were prepared in the same manner.
brdu incorporation, immunohistochemistry and cell count
immediately after fetal vm cells were plated, a solution containing 5bromo-2¢-deoxyuridine (brdu, 50 mm ®nal, sigma) was added to the
cell cultures. brdu was added again when culture medium was
changed to serum-free medium. cells were washed and ®xed as
described previously (mctigue et al., 1998). the cells were then
treated with 0.1% triton x-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min
and then incubated in 2 n hcl for 2 h at 37 °c. they were washed
and incubated in 0.15 m borate buffer (ph 8.5) during 10 min. after
blocking in 5% normal goat serum, the cells were then subjected to
immunostaining.
the procedure for immunohistochemistry has been fully described
elsewhere (zhou et al., 1994). rabbit anti-th antibody (1 : 5000,
chemicon, temecula, ca, usa), gfap (1 : 500, sigma) and mouse
anti-brdu antibody (1 : 500, sigma) were used. the peroxidase was
visualized by incubation with diaminobenzidine (dab) and intensi®ed with nickel cobalt (pierce, rockford, il, usa). the numbers of
th-positive, gfap-positive, or brdu-positive cells were counted in
the entire surface area of a culture well, and were expressed as the
percentages of immunoreactive cells found in paired cultures treated
with cm from control cultures (h2o, used as the reference value, i.e.
100%). in some cases, the number of th-positive cells and entire cell
populations were counted in eight randomly chosen ®elds under
200 3 magni®cation. controls included samples without brdu
incorporation and samples without primary antibodies.
rna isolation and rt-pcr
the cultured vm cells exposed to either apo (2 mm) or h2o were
rinsed with 0.01 m pbs and harvested in denaturing solution at
various time points and stored at ±70 °c until use. the total rna was
isolated using a totally rna isolation kit (ambion, austin, tx,
usa). single strand cdna was synthesized from 1 mg total rna in a
volume of 20 ml containing 50 pmol random hexamers (life
technologies), 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.3, 75 mm kcl, 3 mm
mgcl2, 50 mm dtt, 0.75 u rnasin (promega, madison, wi,

as low as 12.5 pg/ml. the procedures described in the manuals of the
kits were followed in this study.
molecular weight fractions
the cm of vm cultures treated with apo were fractionated into
either less than or more than 5 kda, less than or more than 30 kda,
and less than or more than 50 kda fractions using ultra-free mc
centrifugal ®ltration units (millipore) or amicon ®ltration units
(amicon, danvers, ma, usa). the fraction, that was < 5 kda and
contained exogenously added apo, was discarded. the residues in
®ltration units were washed with dmem/f12 by repeated spins to
ensure complete removal of apo. they were then recovered in
dmem/f12 supplemented with n2, and the volumes were adjusted
in all cases such that concentration of proteins were the same before
the media was added to the recipient vm cultures for bioassay.

reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °c, terminated by heating
5 min at 95 °c, and stored at ±70 °c.
speci®c oligonucleotide pcr primers designed to amplify bdnf
and gdnf were as described previously (zhou et al., 2000b). primers
were also designed to amplify regions of coding sequence for
hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase ( xxxg1075xxx ) gene (table 1).
negative control templates for each set of pcr reactions included
h2o to show that no contaminants were introduced during reaction
preparation. ampli®cation was performed with mastercycler
gradientâ (eppendorf-netheler-hinz gmbh, hamburg, germany)
in a volume of 20 ml containing 1±3 ml template, 25 pmol each
primer and 1.25 u taq polymerase (promega, madison, wi, usa) in
1 3 pcr buffer, 0.2 mm each of  xxxd1148xxx ,  xxxd1837xxx , dctp and dttp,
1.5 mm mgcl2 and 0.5 mci [a-32p]- xxxd1148xxx . cycle condition consisted
of 5 min at 94 °c and n cycles that were listed in table 1, followed
by 72 °c for 7 min. the concentration of  xxxg1075xxx  cdna of each
sample was adjusted to the same level before pcr ampli®cation.
seven-microliter aliquots of each pcr product from the ampli®cation reactions were analysed on 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.
the gels were ®xed with 6% trichloric acid for 30 min, vacuum-dried
and then exposed to x-ray ®lm at ±80 °c for 5 h. all pcr products
obtained were sequenced using automated pcr sequencer (abi
prism system, perkin-elmer, shelton, ct, usa).
measurement of bdnf and gdnf by elisa
the cm from either the apo-stimulated or control vm cultures were
collected at 3 days in vitro (div) and mixed with the protease
inhibitor cocktail (1 : 25, roche diagnostics gmbh, mannheim,
germany). the conditioned media were then concentrated up to 50fold with centricon ®ltration units (molecular weight cut-off, 3000;
millipore, bedford, ma, usa). the protein concentrations of the
samples were adjusted to the same level before 100 ml of each
sample was applied into each well (maxisorpâ 96-well plate, nunc)
for the immunoassay. the concentrations of bdnf or gdnf were
determined using bdnf or gdnf emaxâ immunoassay system
(promega) that are sensitive enough to detect respective trophic factor

experiment treatment
gaba (sigma) and dopamine receptor agonists (skf-38393,
quinpirole, sigma) were added to the cultures starting from the day
after plating out the culture (day 0) until the third day in vitro.
dopamine receptor antagonists (haloperidol, sch-23390 and spiperone, sigma) were applied to cultures at least 2 h before apo was
added.
antibodies against bdnf (gift of x.f. zhou), or gdnf
(peprotech, london, uk) were applied to the vm cultures 4 h
before apo-induced cm was added.
statistical analysis
statistical analysis used commercially available statistical software
(graphpad prism v2.0, graphpad software inc. san diego, ca,
usa). the data were submitted to either a one-way or a two-way
analysis of variance (anova) as indicated in the results section.
either the dunnet test or the student-newman-keuls test (as a
posthoc test) was used to compare data samples from the control
group with the different treatment groups, or between pairs of groups.
differences were considered signi®cant only when p-values were
< 0.05.

results
effect of apo and cm from apo-stimulated vm culture on
the number of mesencephalic da neurons in vitro
typically there were » 110 th-positive neurons per well (96-well
plate) in the untreated cultures 1 day after switching the cultures to
serum-free medium. under the conditions, th-positive neurons
deteriorated and a majority of them died off within 3 days. it was
observed that addition of apo (2 mm) itself signi®cantly increased
the number of th-positive neurons in vm cultures. the number of
th-positive neurons in apo-treated cultures was 2.86-fold that in
untreated cultures (fig. 1). in contrast, treatment with gaba
(10 mm) did not affect the number of th-positive neurons present
in the cultures (gaba, 114.3 6 8.7 cells per well; untreated,
100 6 8.0 cells per well; p > 0.05, n = 3).
to determine whether this effect was due to direct action of apo
or the effect was transferable, the cm of donor vm cultures
incubated with apo were collected at 3 and 6 div. they were then
separately ®ltered through 5 kda ®ltration units repeatedly to remove
any apo present in the medium. it was found that the number of thpositive neurons in the recipient vm cultures increased up to 3.72fold when exposed to the cm derived from the 3-day-old-donor vm
culture, as compared to that treated with the control cm (fig. 2),

cultures of the e14 vm plated at 105 cells/cm2. cultures were ®xed 24 h

cultures (c) and immunostained for th. scale bar, 50 mm.

suggesting that the action of apo can be mimicked by the apo-free
cm taken from the apo-stimulated vm cultures. this result
indicated that the cm from vm cultures incubated with apo, may
contain soluble molecules which are correlated with the elevated
number of th-positive neurons. however, incubation of recipient
vm culture with cm from 6-day-old donor vm cultures failed to
affect the number of th-positive neurons when compared with those
treated with cm from the untreated donor culture (fig. 2). therefore
the following experiments used the culture medium collected from 3day-old donor vm culture throughout.
the promoting effect of the cm from the vm cultures incubated
with apo on expression levels of th in the recipient vm cultures
was dependent on the concentration of apo present in the donor
cultures. the maximal increase of th-positive neurons was observed
when recipient vm cultures were incubated with cm from donor vm
cultures treated with 2 mm apo (fig. 3). higher concentration of
apo (e.g. 5 mm) resulted in deterioration of donor cultures (data not
shown) and 2 mm apo thus was employed in the rest of studies.

to determine whether apo treatment speci®cally promoted the th
expression in the cultures, the recipient vm cultures were incubated
with the cm from apo-stimulated donor vm culture for 1 day and
then ®xed for th immunohistochemical staining. it was observed that
the total number of entire cell populations increased 1.74-fold as
compared to control (table 2). however, the average percentage of
th-positive neurons was increased 5.19-fold (table 2). this suggested that apo-induced cm increased survival of entire cell
populations in cultures but more speci®cally acted on da neurons.
to investigate whether the elevated number of th-positive cells in
the culture resulted from promoted proliferation of neural progenitor
cells and subsequent differentiation toward da neurons, brdu was
used to label proliferating cells in the cultures. the cultures were
®xed at 3 div for immunohistochemical analysis. it was found that
direct apo treatment did not signi®cantly increase the number of
brdu-positive cells (apo, 98.66 6 17.61 cells per well; untreated,
84.66 6 7.25 cells per well; p > 0.05, n = 3). double-labelling of
immunohistochemical staining revealed that no cells showed both
th- and brdu-immunoreactivity in the cultures incubated with either
control or apo-induced cm (data not shown). these ®ndings suggest
that treatment with apo-induced cm did not promote proliferation
of mesencephalic progenitor cells but rather increased the survival of
postmitotic da neurons. it may also result from promoted th
expression in non-da cells in the mesencephalic cultures.
effects of fractions of conditioned medium from apostimulated vm cultures
to determine whether a protein(s) present in apo-induced cm is
responsible for the elevated number of th-positive neurons, the cm
from vm cultures incubated with apo (2 mm) was boiled for 15 min.
alternatively, they were mixed with either  xxxd3258xxx  (®nal
ph 2.0) or sodium hydroxide (®nal ph 12.0) and their ph was then

the dissociated e14 vm were plated at 105/cm2 in dmem/f12 containing 10% fetal calf serum. the medium was changed to serum-free n2 medium with or
without apo-induced cm 4 h after plating. the cultures were ®xed 24 h later for th immunohistochemistry. numbers of th-positive neurons and total cell

**p < 0.01.

brought back to ph 7 after 5-miniute incubation, this treatment was
then followed by ®ltering through 5 kda ®ltration membranes. as
shown in fig. 4, the activity was reduced, but not abolished, by either
of these treatments, as was demonstrated by the fact that the numbers
of th-positive cells in the recipient vm cultures incubated with acidtreated, alkaline-treated cm or heat-inactivated cm were 34.9%,
45.95%, 63.88% of that in the recipient cultures exposed to the native
apo-induced cm at 50% of total volume. this suggests a
proteinaceous composition in the cm.
the apo-induced cm was further fractionated into 3 fractions, i.e.
fraction 1, 5±30 kda, fraction 2, 30±50 kda, fraction 3, >50 kda,
and subsequently their effects on the da neurons of the recipient vm
cultures were evaluated. it was found that these three fractions
resulted in very different effects on the th expression in the recipient
vm cultures (ffractions = 13.09, p < 0.0001). signi®cant increases of
th-positive neurons were observed in the cultures incubated with
fractions 1 and 3 (p < 0.05), but not fraction 2 (p > 0.05). these
activities
were
also
dose-dependent
(f%ofcm = 4.09,
p = 0.02 < 0.05, fig. 5). highest activity was observed when 100%
of fraction 1 or 50% of fractions 3 were used to culture vm
(f = 5.777, p = 0.002). however, fraction 2 had no signi®cant effect
on the number of th-positive cells in recipient vm cultures at three
concentrations tested.

et al., 1994; fawcett et al., 1995). to determine whether the
treatment of apo in the vm cultures resulted in alteration of gene
expression, the mrna level of these neurotrophic factors was
analysed. bdnf was the ®rst to be examined in this setting. there
were signi®cant elevations of bdnf transcript (364 base pairs) at
10 min following addition of apo. it had returned to control levels at
2 h and thereafter (fig. 6). rt-pcr analysis of rna from the vm
cultures using gdnf primers yielded a major band of the predicted
size (of ~ 622 base pairs), as well as a minor band of ~ 544 base pairs.
the levels of the two gdnf transcripts were signi®cantly increased
in the apo-treated vm cultures 10 min and 2 h after treatment.
however, their expression had returned to control levels by 3 days
after plating (fig. 6).
by using an elisa assay, both bdnf and gdnf proteins were
detected in the vm culture media. the concentration of bdnf was
increased 1.6-fold in the apo-stimulated cm as compared with the
control (apo, 50.08 6 12.3 pg/ml of the concentrated cm; control,
31.3 6 7 pg/ml, n = 5). similarly, the apo treatment also resulted
in increased protein levels of gdnf of up to 2.56 fold (apo,
243.0 6 22.3 pg/ml; control, 93.5 6 16.7 pg/ml, n = 3) in the cm
of mesencephalic cultures.
addition of antibodies against either bdnf or gdnf partially
abolished the effect of apo-induced cm
as the mrna of bdnf and gdnf, as well as their protein levels were
up-regulated following apo treatment, it was next investigated
whether these trophic factors were responsible, either fully or in part,
for the elevation of th expression. apo-induced cm was incubated
with one of the two antibodies, respectively, 4 h before they were used
in vm recipient cultures. these antisera recognize their respective
antigens with a high degree of speci®city and have been previously
used for in vivo and in vitro studies neutralizing the biological
activities of these endogenous growth factors (zhou et al., 2000a, c).
their high speci®cities were veri®ed as addition of individual antibody
against bdnf or gdnf in the vm cultures neutralized the survivalpromoting effect of respective human recombinant trophic factors as
shown in fig. 7. moreover, irrelevant rabbit igg (e.g. antibodies
against fos or microtubule-associated protein) had no effect on the
survival of th-positive neurons. it was observed that additions of
individual antibody against either bdnf or gdnf reduced the apomediated increase in the number of th-positive neurons by 20.9±
23.3% (fig. 7). together, these data suggest that the apo-mediated
effect was partially dependent on bdnf and gdnf produced by the
mesencephalic cells.

neuronal elements in the adult rat substantia nigra and in cultured

whether da receptors are involved in the apo-induced elevation of
th expression observed in this study. to determine whether d1

to establish more precisely whether the supporting effect of apo
was mediated via d1 or d2 receptors, the effectiveness of apo
treatment was challenged by the dopamine speci®c receptor
antagonists, haloperidol (nonselective), sch-23390 (selective d1),
and spiperone (selective d2). they were added to donor vm
cultures 2 h before apo addition on day 0. the cm was
collected on day 3 and ®ltered through a 5 kda ®lteratioin unit
to remove hal and apo present in the medium. the recipient
vm cultures were incubated with the ®ltered cm. the number of
th-positive neurons was determined at day 1. the results
suggested that the effect of apo was completely blocked by
1 mm haloperidol (fig. 8b). moreover, the effect of the cm was
decreased with addition of sch-23390 (10 mm) or spiperone
(10 mm), but neither completely abolished apo-mediated effect on
th expression in culture (fig. 8b).

positive cells as compared to control (fig. 9). however, incubation of the recipient vm cultures with the cm from apo-treated
fetal hippocampal cultures did not increase the number of thpositive cells (10% cm, 89.34% 6 40.0; 50% cm,
110.75% 6 17.5; h2o, used as the reference value, i.e. 100%;
f = 0.7393, p > 0.05). these results demonstrated that the effect
of apo may be dependent on the presence of da receptors (d1/
d2) in the target cells. moreover, non-da innervated brain
regions (such as hippocampus) may not be able to exert the effect
speci®cally on da neurons in response to apo stimulation.

discussion
the observations in the present study indicate that apo increases the
number of cultured mesencephalic da neurons by enhancing
biosynthesis of bdnf and gdnf, as indicated by up-regulation of
mrna and protein levels of these trophic factors. furthermore, this
effect may be involved in activation of the dopamine d1 and d2
receptors. thus, the present study presents novel evidence demonstrating that apo is able to regulate neuronal growth of nigrostriatal
system through multiple trophic factors.
roles of neurotrophic factors
there is ample evidence indicating that neurotrophic factors, such as
gdnf (lin et al., 1993) and bdnf (beck et al., 1993; zhou et al.,
1994), in¯uence growth of developing and adult nigral da neurons.

rat embryos were cultured in dmem/f12 supplemented with n2 and
penicillin/streptomycin. da receptor agonists were added to the cultures and
maintained for 3 days. th immunohistochemistry was performed at 3 div
and the number of th-positive cells was counted. for inhibitory study in b,
the da receptor antagonists were added to the donor vm cultures 2 h
before apo was applied. fractions of > 5 kda were used to culture
recipient e14 vm neurons. data represent the mean 6 sem of triplicates
from three independent experiments.

the questions are whether these growth factors are produced by
cultured mesencephalic neurons and whether they are subsequently
responsible for the apo-induced effect observed in this study. the
results described here suggest that these growth factors are very likely
to play important roles in this process. their mrna and protein
levels were upregualted in the vm cultures stimulated with apo, as
indicated by rt-pcr analysis and immunoassay. this is consistent
with kuppers's observation that stimulation with dopamine or a
 xxxg655xxx  agonist increased bdnf mrna and protein in
neuronal cultures (kuppers & beyer, 2001). moreover, the antibody
neutralization studies described here showed that preincubation of
cm from apo-treated vm cultures partially abolished the increase in
number of th-positive neurons, suggesting that bdnf and gdnf
were relevant to the activity of the cm. the molecular weight of most
neurotrophic factors, except for gdnf, is less than 27 kda. thus
presence of bdnf (26 kda) may partially explain the trophic activity
of the < 30 kda fraction observed in this study.

fig. 9. incubation of recipient vm culture with cm from apo-treated fetal
striatal cultures increased the number of th-positive neurons in the
cultures. the vm cultures were established as described in materials and
methods section and supplemented with a varying percentage of apoinduced conditioned medium from the donor striatal cultures treated with
apo (0.2 or 2 mm). *p < 0.01 compared with control. data represent the
mean 6 sem of triplicates from three independent experiments.

the molecular weight of the gdnf homodimer is about 32 kda
(lin et al., 1993; okragly & haak-frendscho, 1997). therefore, it
was assumed that the 30±50 kda fraction would act as a trophic agent
on da neurons in the survival assay. the ®nding that this fraction
failed to elevate the number of da neurons in cultures suggested that
it might not have contained gdnf. one possible explanation for this
discrepancy is that the gdnf homodimer had fallen into the
< 30 kda fraction in dia®ltration. this is due to the fact that its
molecular weight (32 kda) and the molecular weight cut-off of the
®lter (30 kda) are so closed to each other that the ®lter membrane
failed to retain gdnf molecules. although the data suggest that
bdnf and gdnf may be responsible for the neurotrophic activity
observed here, it does not preclude the possibility that other trophic
factors are involved.
the present study also showed that the promoting effect of the cm
from the apo-treated cultures was present in the 5±30 kda fraction
and the > 50 kda fraction. intriguingly, the latter possessed higher
activity than the former (containing bdnf, gdnf and other factors),
as the promoting effect was more prominent when recipient vm
cultures were incubated with the > 50 kda fraction at 50% of total
volume (fig. 5). this characterization distinguished itself from most
known growth factors, suggesting that it may contain a novel
dopaminergic growth factor(s).
it has been reported that apo treatment elevated mrna level of
 xxxg1564xxx  (ngf) in cultured astrocytes, raising the question
of whether ngf is involved in the action of the cm (ohta et al.,
2000). although the mrna and protein levels of ngf in the vm
cultures were not examined in this study, it is very likely that ngf is
not relevant in this regard, as it has been well established that ngf
possesses no trophic action on da neurons in either in vivo or in vitro
studies (knusel et al., 1990a, b).
astroglia may not be responsible for the observed upregulation of th expression
it is plausible that the molecules responsible for the increase in the
number of th-positive neurons observed here were released from
mesencephalic cells that exclusively express d1 and d2 receptors (as
judged by the evidence presented in this study). moreover, they can

also be produced by d1/d2-expressing striatal cells, the target of
nigral da neurons (gerfen et al., 1990; trovero et al., 1994). there is
a large volume of evidence indicating that da receptors are
expressed in astrocytes (bal et al., 1994). therefore it is possible
that apo acts on glia through da receptors to produce the observed
trophic effect. indeed, apo treatment stimulates the synthesis and
release of neurotrophic factors, such as ngf and gdnf, in astrocytes
(ohta et al., 2000). dopamine or dopaminergic drugs are also able to
induce the synthesis of various growth factors (e.g. ®broblast growth
factor-2) in cultured astrocytes (reuss & unsicker, 2000; reuss et al.,
2000). if this were the case, however, then apo would not have been
able to promote the number of th-positive neurons, as well as the
overall cell population in vm cultures, as they were incubated in
serum-free media that is highly inhibitory to the growth of astroglia
(< 0.1% gfap-positive cells were present in the vm cultures). thus,
we have postulated that astroglia do not seem to mediate the apoinduced activity and thus the molecules responsible for this effect are
released by the mesencephalic da neurons and/or other cell
subpopulations and may act in an autocrine/paracrine manner.
involvement of da receptors
the apo-induced up-regulation of th expression in the present
study seems to be heavily dependent on activation of d1 and d2
receptors, but not gaba receptors, all of which are expressed in da
neurons and mesencephalic astrocytes. however, the observed effect
was not due to the activation of gaba receptors, as gaba itself
failed to promote the survival of cultured da neurons in this study.
moreover, treatment of da receptor agonists produced a similar
effect to that of apo itself, and the effect of the media from apostimulated vm culture was partially blocked by either sch-23390 or
spiperone, but neither completely abolished the spe in the recipient
vm cultures. furthermore, the media from apo-treated striatal
cultures, but not hippocampal cultures, also possessed trophic
activity. taken together, these ®ndings strongly support the notion
that the d1 and d2 receptors play critical roles in mediating the
trophic activity of apo. this observation, however, is not consistent
with those reported by ling et al. (ling et al., 1998). they suggested
that culture media conditioned by exposure to vm cultures in the
presence of  xxxg657xxx  agonist pramipexole, but not  xxxg656xxx 
agonists and antagonists, increased the growth and survival of da
neurons in recipient vm cultures (carvey et al., 1997; ling et al.,
1998). furthermore, they showed that a 35 -kda band as revealed by
electrophoresis, which was present in normal cultures, was increased
in pramipexole-incubated cultures. as the 30±50 kda fraction
showed no trophic activity in the present study, it is likely that
apo promoted the th expression in cultured da neurons through
distinct mechanisms of pramipexole action.
although these pharmacological studies strongly suggest the
importance of da receptors in mediating the apo-induced activity,
the present results do not rule out the involvement of receptors of
known trophic factors, such as trkb and  xxxg1617xxx . it has been shown that
trkbtk+ and  xxxg1617xxx  mrna levels in the striatum were increased in
postnatal rats treated with the indirect dopamine agonist cocaine
(jung & bennett, 1996a; jung & bennett, 1996b). the trkbtk+ effect
was blocked by pretreatment with the  xxxg655xxx  antagonist,
sch23390, and was not affected by pretreatment with the d2
receptor antagonist, eticlopride. in contrast,  xxxg1617xxx  regulation may be
mediated by independent stimulation of d1 and d2 receptors (jung &
bennett, 1996b). as both fetal mesencephalic da neurons and striatal
neurons express trkb and  xxxg1617xxx  receptors, we postulate that apo may
modulate receptors of trophic factors thereby in¯uencing the growth
and differentiation of mesencephalic and striatal neuronal cells.

moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that  xxxg656xxx  receptor and
somatostatin receptor  xxxg2209xxx  interact physically via hetero-oligomerization to create a novel receptor which is the molecular basis for
interaction between two different neurotransmitter systems
(rocheville et al., 2000). whether apo acts on da receptors as
well as receptors of other systems requires further study.
the present study showed the potent effect of apo on the thexpressing neurons in mesencephalic cultures. these neurons are
most likely postmitotic as they are derived from e14 rat vm
(hanaway et al., 1972). thus, the increased number of th-positive
neurons observed here could be the result of a growth factor-mediated
survival-promoting effect. alternatively, it is possible that the growth
factors work synergistically with apo and/or da (produced by
mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons) to induce th expression in the
non-da cells in the cultures. this hypotheses is supported by
previous studies of these authors and others, demonstrating that
growth factors, such as bdnf,  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx  or ciliary neurotrophic
factor, in combination with da/apo could elicit th expression in
cultured fetal brain cells (magal et al., 1993; du et al., 1995; zhou
et al., 1996). more detailed investigation is therefore needed to
distinguish between these possibilities.
it has been demonstrated here that apo stimulated the synthesis of
both bdnf and gdnf in mesencephalic as well as striatal neuronal
cultures. these growth factors could either directly in¯uence striatal
neural cells or could be retrogradely transported to the substantia
nigra (anderson et al., 1995; ferguson & johnson, 1991; mufson
et al., 1994). it is possible therefore that apo could be a
physiological factor regulating growth and differentiation in the
nigrostriatal system. this notion is supported by recent ®ndings that
demonstrate the presence of the apo enantiomers in extracellular
¯uid collected from the rat striatum by microdialysis. moreover, the
concentrations of r(±)- or s(+)-apo in brain tissue is signi®cantly
higher than the free apo measured in plasma (sam et al., 1997),
suggesting its involvement in maintaining brain function at least in
adult rats.
it has been shown that administration of apo in patients with
parkinson's disease reduces the need for orally delivered antiparkinsonian medication by a mean of 59%, and virtually eliminated `off'
time. there was also a signi®cant reduction in dyskinesias and a
markedly improved quality of life (manson et al., 2001). future studies
may need to address the question of whether administration of apo
could enhance biosynthesis and release of mesencephalic and striatal
bdnf, gdnf and possibly other factors in vivo, through which it may
be protecting nigral da neurons against neurodegeneration.
in conclusion, the results reported here indicate that apo is a
potent trophic substance on mesencephalic da neurons and may play
a pivotal role in the development of the nigrostriatal system, as well
as maintaining its normal function in the adult. this effect may be
mediated by activation of the da receptor subtypes d1 and d2
thereby increasing the production of multiple growth factors.
identi®cation of the factors present in the > 50 kda faction which
elicited trophic action on da neurons may be helpful to develop new
methods of treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as
parkinson's disease.
