aim: to compare the properties of  xxxd2361xxx  with  xxxd2364xxx  or insulin aspart in various in vitro and in vivo experiments, thereby
highlighting the importance of performing dose–response studies when investigating insulin analogues, in this study speciﬁcally  xxxd2361xxx .

methods: displacement of membrane-associated insulin receptors from human and rat hepatocytes, and from chinese hamster ovary cells
over-expressing human  xxxg1194xxx  (cho-hir) at varying albumin concentrations is measured. lipogenesis in primary rat adipocytes over
time and the effects in the simultaneous presence of  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx  or insulin aspart are assessed. the hyperinsulinaemic
euglycaemic clamp technique in rats is used to establish dose–response curves for multiple metabolic endpoints and to investigate the effects
of the simultaneous presence of  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx .
results: both in vitro and in vivo,  xxxd2361xxx  shows full efﬁcacy and right-shifted parallel dose–response curves compared with human
insulin. the potency estimates are different between the in vivo and in vitro conditions and among different in vitro conditions, that is the
potency decreases in vitro with increasing albumin concentration. the effects of  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx  are additive both in vitro
and in vivo.
conclusions:  xxxd2361xxx  is fully efﬁcacious compared with  xxxd2364xxx  on all metabolic endpoints measured in vitro and in vivo. the
fact that the potency estimates are method-dependent emphasizes the importance of establishing full dose–response relationships when
characterizing  xxxd2361xxx .

introduction
 xxxd2361xxx  was engineered to overcome treatment-related
variability associated with injecting insulin crystal suspensions.
 xxxd2361xxx  is a long-acting insulin molecule, soluble at
neutral ph [1–4]. it differs from the native molecule in the
removal of the thrb30 and the acylation with a myristoyl fatty
acid at the lysb29 residue, which enables it to bind to albumin. furthermore, the myristoylation enables  xxxd2361xxx 
to form insulin di-hexamers composed of two zinc hexamers.
the protracted effect of  xxxd2361xxx  is thus obtained by
both self-association and albumin binding at the injection site
from where it will slowly dissociate and enter the bloodstream.
in the bloodstream,  xxxd2361xxx  will bind to albumin,
thus providing a further buffering and smoothing effect before
entering the interstitium at the target tissue [5]. the time
course of these events, that is buffering and smoothing, forms
the basis of the flat and long-lasting pharmacodynamic profile of  xxxd2361xxx . the clinical benefits, which include
improved predictability, reduced risk of hypoglycaemic events
and weight neutrality in comparison with nph, have been
amply shown [6–9].

the objective of this study was to compare the properties of
 xxxd2361xxx  with  xxxd2364xxx  or insulin aspart in various
in vitro and in vivo experiments, thereby highlighting the importance of performing dose–response studies when investigating
insulin analogues, in this study specifically  xxxd2361xxx .

material and methods
the first international standard for  xxxd2364xxx  (who
83/500) was used as reference throughout this study. human
 xxxg124xxx  (hsa) was either sigma (product no. a1887,
essentially fatty acid free) or behringwerke ag (product orha,
made fatty acid free by charcoal wash). albumin is required
to avoid adhesion of insulin to surfaces, and most of the cell
systems will function only when a protein like albumin is
present in the medium.

 xxxg1194xxx  afﬁnity
the  xxxg1194xxx  binding affinity of  xxxd2361xxx  was
compared with  xxxd2364xxx  in intact chinese hamster ovary
cells over-expressing human  xxxg1194xxx  (cho-hir),
and in hepatic extracts from humans (crude liver membrane
preparation obtained with consent from a deceased 78-yearold, caucasian female via analytical biological services, inc.,
wilmington, de, usa) and rat (wistar, male, 150–200 g,

taconic europe a/s, lille skensved, denmark). extractions
of  xxxg1194xxx  bearing membranes from liver tissue
were essentially performed as described by neville [8]. the
final membrane pellets were resuspended in buffer [50 mm
hepes (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid),
150 mm nacl, 5 mm  xxxd2534xxx  , 0.02% triton x-100] supplemented with 5% glycerol and stored at −80 ◦ c.
radioligand binding to membrane-associated insulin receptors was performed in duplicate in 96-well optiplates (perkin
elmer danmark a/s, skovlunde, denmark) using 50 mug of
membrane protein (human or rat) incubated for 30 min at
25 ◦ c with 50 pm [125 i-tyra14]- xxxd2364xxx  (novo nordisk
a/s, måløv, denmark) in a total volume of 200 mul assay
buffer [50 mm hepes, 150 mm nacl, 5 mm  xxxd2534xxx  , 0.02%
triton x-100, 0.1% hsa and completetm edta (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)-free protease inhibitors] and increasing
concentrations of unlabelled  xxxd2364xxx  or  xxxd2361xxx 
(0.01–300 nm). under these conditions, equilibrium of 125 iinsulin binding to insulin receptors was reached within 30 min.
the assay was terminated by the addition of 50 mug of a suspension of wheat germ agglutinin coated pvt (polyvinyl
toluene) microspheres (20 mg/ml) (ge healthcare europe
gmbh, hillerłd, denmark). after 5 min of slight agitation,
the plate was centrifuged (400 g for 6 minutes) and counted
(perkin elmer danmark a/s, skovlunde, denmark). in all
studies performed, the fraction of bound radioligand relative
to the amount added was below 10%.
for the cho-hir experiments, the cells were maintained
in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (dmem; gibco 21885025) with 10% foetal calf serum, 1% non-essential amino
acids, 50 mug/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin and 1 mum
methotrexate. cultures were split 1 : 5 twice a week. for binding studies, 3 × 104 cells were plated in 96-well plates on day
0. on day 1, the medium was replaced with dmem with 1%
non-essential amino acids, 50 mug/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml
penicillin and 1% hsa. on day 2, the cells were washed in
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and dmem, and varying concentrations of hsa were added together with a fixed amount
of 125 i-insulin and varying amounts of either  xxxd2364xxx  or
 xxxd2361xxx . after incubation at 4 ◦ c for 120 min, the cells
were washed twice with pbs, scintillation fluid added and the
cells counted.

metabolic responses in rat adipocytes
primary adipocytes were isolated from wistar rats (taconic
m&b, denmark) and prepared using methods adapted from
refs [11,12]. the rats were killed and epididymal fat pads
removed and placed in incubation buffer [2.5 mm cacl2
(2h2 o), 2.5 mm nacl, 110 mm kcl, 4.75 mm kh2 po4 ,
1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx  (7 h2 o), 1.2 mm hsa 1% and 25 mm hepes],
including 4 mg/ml collagenase (worthington biochemical
corp., lakewood, nj ,united states) and 2 mg/ml glucose.
collagen degradation was carried out at 37 ◦ c under vigorous
shaking for 1 h. the cell suspension was filtered, washed twice
and resuspended in incubation buffer. the cell suspension
(0.1 ml) was then incubated at 37 ◦ c under gentle shaking in
picoplate (perkin elmer danmark a/s, skovlunde, denmark)

with 10 mul glucose solution, 0.08 mg/ml and 12.5 mul/ml 3d-[33h]glucose (ge healthcare europe gmbh, hillerłd, denmark)
and 10 mul of different concentrations of  xxxd2364xxx  or
 xxxd2361xxx . incubation was stopped by adding 150 mul of
scintillation fluid (microscint e, packard) at 2, 4, 8 or 24 h, and
the cells counted (topcounter, packard).
combinations of  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx  or insulin
aspart. eight discrete  xxxd2361xxx  concentrations (0–8385
pm) and eight discrete concentrations of  xxxd2364xxx  (0–437
pm) or insulin aspart (0–461 pm) were combined in all 64
permutations and the lipogenic effect was measured. each
experiment was performed at two different hsa concentrations (0.5 and 1.0%). parameters describing the dose–response
surface were calculated and used to evaluate whether the effects
are additive.

hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp studies in rats
the animal experimental procedures were approved by the
danish animal experiments inspectorate.
general procedures. male sprague–dawley rats (approximately 400 g) were instrumented with permanent catheters
in the jugular vein (for infusions) and carotid artery (for sampling), and recovered from surgery for 9–11 days. the rats
were then fasted overnight and subjected to a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp during which they had access to
fresh water and were allowed to move freely in their cages.
 xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx  were formulated at ph
7.4 in a vehicle consisting of 5 mm na-phosphate, 140 mm
nacl and, in order to prevent protein adsorption, 70 ppm
polysorbate-20. the syringe/tube system was then flushed with
2 ml of the insulin infusates to saturate any residual adsorption
potential of the insulins to the inner surfaces after which
the flushed solution was discarded. the syringe and tubing
were then filled with fresh insulin infusate. this procedure
ensures that the infusate concentrations represent the actual
administered dose accurately (data on file).
a primed (0–4 min), continuous (4–300 min) insulin infusion was administered intravenously. plasma glucose concentration was measured  xxxd1891xxx -min intervals and maintained at a
target level of 6.2 mm by adjustments of an exogenous glucose
infusion rate (gir). the mean gir during the final 60 min of
the clamp was used as a measure of efficacy.
plasma concentrations of  xxxd2361xxx  was analysed in a
sandwich elisa using a monoclonal antibody against insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  (hui.304.01) as a capture antibody and a biotinylated
monoclonal antibody against  xxxd2364xxx  (hui-001) as
a detector antibody. plasma concentrations of  xxxd2364xxx 
were measured using a commercial sandwich elisa (dako a/s,
glostrup, denmark) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
the assays had no cross-reaction with rat insulin.
 xxxd2361xxx / xxxd2364xxx  dose–response clamp study.
 xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  were infused at intended
rates of 5, 15, 45 and 90 pmol/kg/min and 33, 100, 300 and
600 pmol/kg/min, respectively (n = 6–8 per dose level). based
on hplc measurements of the infusates, the actual infusion
rates were estimated and used in the subsequent dose–response

analysis. in an attempt to approach a steady state in plasma
insulin concentrations equally quickly, the infusions were
primed during the initial 4 min using an appropriate priming
dose, taking into account the different clearance kinetics of the
two insulin molecules, corresponding to 10-min infusion for
 xxxd2364xxx  and to 40-min infusion for  xxxd2361xxx .
plasma samples were taken at 60, 150, 240 and 300 min
for determination of insulin concentrations. at t = 255 min,
the rats were given an intravenous bolus of 2-deoxy-d-[13h]glucose (2dg, 40 muci/rat; amersham) and blood samples
were subsequently collected at t = 257, 260, 265, 270, 275,
280, 290 and 300 min for determination of radioactivity after
deproteinization of the plasma samples [13]. immediately
after the t = 300 min blood sample was taken, a final large
blood sample was collected for measurement of plasma
concentrations of c-peptide, lactate, free fatty acid (ffa),
glycerol, total ketone, total cholesterol and triglyceride (tg).
the rats were subsequently killed by an i.v. pentobarbital
injection, and epididymal fat (ef), subcutaneous fat (sc), the
white (wg) and red (rg) part of the gastrocnemius muscle
and the soleus (sol) and extensor digitorum longus (edl)
muscles were quickly excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen for
determination of 2dg uptake as described elsewhere [14].
 xxxd2361xxx / xxxd2364xxx  combination clamp study.
 xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  were infused at 9, 18 and
36 pmol/kg/min and 60, 120 and 240 pmol/kg/min, respectively (n = 6 per dose level). in two subgroups of rats, human
insulin and  xxxd2361xxx  were combined to give dose rates
at 9 + 60 and 18 + 120 pmol/kg/min, respectively. in order to
reach a steady state in plasma insulin concentrations quickly,
the infusions were primed during the initial 4 min with a dose
corresponding to 10 min of infusion. plasma samples were
taken at 180 and 300 min for the determination of insulin concentrations to verify the expected exposure (data not shown).

statistical methods
for determination of the relative potencies of  xxxd2361xxx 
relative to  xxxd2364xxx , ec50 values were calculated from the
concentration–response data using a four-parameter logistic
method [15], in which parallel log(concentration)–response
curves are fitted to the equation:
r(d) = b +

mdalpha
ealpha ln(ec50 )

+ dalpha

(1)

here, r is the dose-dependent response, b is the basal
response at zero dose, m is the maximal increase/decrease in
response, d is the dose, alpha is the steepness of the linear part of
the sigmoidal curve and ec50 /ed50 is the concentration/dose
giving the half maximal response. log(concentration)–response
curves were fitted to the experimental data under the assumption of a common slope, basal and maximal response level of
the curves for  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx  as required
for potency estimation.
the relative potency of  xxxd2361xxx  was calculated as the
ratio between the estimated ec50 values in vitro or ed50 values
in vivo for  xxxd2364xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx  expressed in
percentage including 95% confidence intervals. the combined

volume 12 no. 8 august 2010

effect of  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx /insulin aspart was
described by substituting the dose (d) in equation (1) with the
following expression:
d = z + up + sigma

zup
z + up

(2)

here, z is the concentration of the standard insulin (human
insulin or insulin aspart) and u is the concentration of the test
 xxxd2361xxx . the potency of  xxxd2361xxx  (p) is relative
to the standard insulin. the interaction between the two ligands is quantified by the factor sigma , which is zero if additive
effect is observed. in the latter situation, the total dose is the
sum of concentration of the two applied ligands, where proper
correction for the right-shift in concentration–response curves
has been made.
the parameters to be estimated on basis of the experimental
data are b, m, ec50 , alpha for  xxxd2364xxx /insulin aspart and
 xxxd2361xxx  and sigma . the apparent potency is determined as
the ratio between ec50 of  xxxd2364xxx /insulin aspart and
ec50 of  xxxd2361xxx . it is tested (95% confidence limits)
whether sigma is significantly different from 0, in which case the
two ligands interact in the lipogenic response.

results
 xxxg1194xxx  binding
figure 1 shows that  xxxd2361xxx  is able to displace
completely [125 i-tyra14]- xxxd2364xxx  from the insulin
receptor. in these equilibrium competition receptor binding
assays with  xxxg1194xxx  on semi-purified membranes
from either human or rat liver plasma membranes, insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx  have the same ability to displace
[125 i-tyra14]- xxxd2364xxx . compared with  xxxd2364xxx ,
the concentration of  xxxd2361xxx  required to obtain this
degree of displacement is higher, that is a right-shift in the
concentration–response curve, resulting in relative potencies
(95% confidence limits) of 7.0% (5.2–9.4%) in human liver
plasma membrane preparations (n = 3), and 4.9% (4.3–5.5%)
in rat liver plasma membrane preparations (n = 7) (figure 1a,
b). similarly, in cho-hir cells,  xxxd2361xxx  also showed
full displacement of labelled  xxxd2364xxx , and a right-shift
of the concentration-response curve compared with unlabelled
 xxxd2364xxx  (figure 2). the ability of  xxxd2361xxx  to
bind to albumin can be studied using this assay when the
concentration of hsa in the medium is varied. the equilibrium
between the binding of  xxxd2361xxx  to the  xxxg1194xxx 
and to albumin depends on the number of insulin receptors,
the albumin concentration and the association and dissociation
rate constants governing the affinities of  xxxd2361xxx  to the
 xxxg1194xxx  and to albumin. accordingly, we observed
a reduced potency of  xxxd2361xxx  and that the estimated
ec50 for  xxxd2361xxx  increases with increasing albumin
concentration (figure 2), whereas the ec50 for  xxxd2364xxx 
is independent of the albumin concentration.

infusion rates show full efficacy of  xxxd2361xxx  compared
with  xxxd2364xxx  with a right-shifted, parallel dose–response
curve (figure 5). the dose–response curves relating insulin
infusion rate and the various other endpoints also provided
parallel, right-shifted dose–response curves with the same
estimated maximal response. for plasma concentrations of
c-peptide, glycerol and for 2dg uptake in sc fat, the data
did not allow solid potency estimates to be determined.
the estimated degree of right-shift including 95% confidence
intervals is indicated for each endpoint in table 1. the 95%
confidence intervals for these endpoints overlap with that

parameters.

full efficacy of  xxxd2361xxx  (i.e. full agonism) and rightshifted, parallel concentration–response curves were observed
relative to  xxxd2364xxx . these experiments show a timelinear increase in cumulative, maximal response (figure 3) and
also show that the relative potency (with 95% ci) of insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  in this in vitro assay is time independent during 24-h
incubation: 0.87% (0.77–0.99%) at 2 h, 0.88% (0.79–0.99%)

compatible with an additive effect of  xxxd2361xxx  and either
of the two other ligands. as seen in the table 2, the potency of
 xxxd2361xxx  was shown to depend on the hsa concentration
in this in vitro assay, whereas the additivity was not observed to
be influenced by the hsa concentration.

combined effect of  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx 
in vivo
the effect of simultaneous infusion of  xxxd2361xxx  and
 xxxd2364xxx  was also assessed in the clamp model (table 3).
three infusion rates of both  xxxd2364xxx  and insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  were administered separately. based on the responses,
and assuming same maximal and basal gir as in the first
dose–response clamp study, the potency of  xxxd2361xxx 
relative to  xxxd2364xxx  in this experiment was estimated
to be 11.82% (9.99–13.98%). the mean gir during the
last hour of the clamp study was also calculated for the
simultaneous infusions of  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx .
knowing the relative potency of  xxxd2361xxx  allowed for a
transformation of the  xxxd2361xxx  dose in the combination
study to the equivalent dose of  xxxd2364xxx . assuming

the two medium (120 + 18 pmol/kg/min) dosages of  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx , the effects on gir closely match those that would be predicted
if the  xxxd2361xxx  had been substituted by an equivalent dose of  xxxd2364xxx . the chi-square for each combination is 8.7 (n = 7) and 3.6 (n = 5),

discussion
the data presented in this study as well as previous
reports [16,17] clearly show that  xxxd2361xxx  is fully efficacious compared with  xxxd2364xxx  both in vitro and in vivo.
our data furthermore show that  xxxd2361xxx  exhibits a varying degree of right-shift in its concentration/dose–response
relationship depending on the method used. most importantly,
there is a principal difference between potencies determined
in vitro and in vivo, the difference being the quantification of
ligand, that is concentration and dose. for albumin bound
insulin analogues such as  xxxd2361xxx , it is difficult to
predict the exact location of concentration/dose–response relationships [4]. an important factor is that the albumin bound
fraction serves as a depot, both in vitro and in vivo. additionally, acylated human insulins have low affinity to the insulin
receptor compared with  xxxd2364xxx  [18,19]. furthermore,
albumin binding affinities differ between species and among
acylated insulin analogues, which influences the potency and
the time course of glucose lowering [3,4]. these properties
contribute to the difficulty in predicting the exact location of
concentration/dose–response relationships.
equilibrium binding studies reveal that  xxxd2361xxx 
can displace 125 i-insulin from the receptors as effectively as
 xxxd2364xxx . however, because of the albumin binding
properties of  xxxd2361xxx , the ec50 estimate will depend
on the prevailing concentration of albumin as shown in the
binding to cho-hir cells. as  xxxd2364xxx  binds negligibly
to albumin, the ec50 estimates do not depend on the albumin
concentration in a given assay. thus, the degree of right-shift
for  xxxd2361xxx ’s concentration–response curve increases
with increasing albumin concentrations.

adipocytes with a right-shifted concentration–response curve.
in this assay, the responses are cumulative and the ec50 values
are constant between 2 and 24 h. we interpret this to mean that
 xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx  are processed equally with
respect to their  xxxg1194xxx  binding and effect. as for the
 xxxg1194xxx  binding studies, the albumin concentration
also influences the degree of right-shift in this metabolic assay,
as shown in the study of combined effects of  xxxd2361xxx 
and  xxxd2364xxx /insulin aspart, where the apparent potency
of  xxxd2361xxx  was decreased by approximately 30% when
the albumin concentration was doubled from 0.5 to 1%.
wada et al. [17] have also observed in various signalling
and functional in vitro assays that  xxxd2361xxx  displays a
right-shift in its concentration–response curves compared with
 xxxd2364xxx  and that the degree of right-shift depends on
the prevailing albumin concentration. in experiments where
the ligand concentrations allowed for an approach towards
saturation in the response to be observed at the higher end of
the concentration–response curves, the experiments published
by wada et al. show full efficacy of  xxxd2361xxx . when
only the lower end of the curve is investigated, as was the
case in several data sets in the study by wada et al., it is
not possible to conclude on the putative maximal efficacy.
another complicating factor is that signalling events are
dynamic, change over time and depend on the binding kinetics
of the ligand [20]. thus, the measured response may vary
differentially over time for different ligands depending on
the timing of activation/deactivation of this response. the
concentration–response curves related to signalling in the
study by wada et al. were assessed 10 min after application of
ligand, without providing clear evidence that this time point
represents equivalent responses for the different ligands.
böhm et al. [21] investigated adipogenesis induced by
 xxxd2361xxx  in 3t3-l1 cells. based on a single concentration
of  xxxd2364xxx  (5 nm) and two concentrations of insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  (5 and 20 nm), they prematurely concluded on insulin
 xxxd2361xxx ’s ability to induce adipogenesis. in addition, these
authors did not report using albumin in their experimental
set-up, and they did not document the recovery of human
insulin and  xxxd2361xxx  in the incubation media. with
no albumin present, adhesion of  xxxd2361xxx  to surfaces
will affect the actual concentration in the media, particularly
at low concentrations. furthermore, for in vitro assays, the
elimination of the insulin molecules is believed to be a receptormediated degradation, and when interpreting the results from
these assays, it is assumed that only a negligible fraction of the
ligand is eliminated. if the concentration of a ligand changes
over time, the estimation of the ec50 value will be erratic. in
our lipogenesis assay in primary adipocytes, the conditions of
negligible consumption of ligand and a cumulative response
are fulfilled, resulting in a constant potency estimate over 24 h.
as we have clearly shown, there is no difference in the ability
of  xxxd2361xxx  to induce lipogenesis with an approximate
100-fold difference in potency, but full concentration–response
curves evaluated after different incubation times were required
to reach this firm conclusion.
in contrast to in vitro studies where receptor-mediated
ligand consumption is negligible, significant receptor-mediated

degradation occurs in vivo. in general, in vitro potency does not
predict in vivo potency because of differences in quantification
of ligand, that is concentration and dose, respectively. in the
hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp studies performed in
rats, which represent an approximate steady-state situation
where time dependencies of the response play a negligible
role,  xxxd2361xxx  also exhibits full efficacy with rightshifted dose–response curves compared with  xxxd2364xxx .
towards the end of the clamp study, an approximate steadystate situation is reached, and the measured response is the
rate of infused glucose required to maintain euglycaemia,
representing whole-body glucose metabolism. in addition,
rates of 2-deoxy-d-[1-3h] glucose uptake in various tissues
as well as insulin-dependent metabolites in the plasma were
measured. the potency estimates from these responses had
overlapping confidence intervals with that obtained using
gir as the response parameter, showing that at steady-state
conditions,  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx  exert similar
and equal effects on all target tissues investigated.
the potency estimate for  xxxd2361xxx  in vivo of
approximately 10% relative to that of  xxxd2364xxx  represents
the situation in rats. in other species, the potency may be
different. for example, in dogs and pigs, the approximate
potency is 100% [16,19], whereas in humans the value is
25% [22,23], which is in line with the definition of a dosing
unit (u) for  xxxd2361xxx  ( xxxd2361xxx ®; 1 u = 24 nmol,
 xxxd2364xxx ; 1 iu = 6 nmol) as defined by the clinical
experience during development prior to market authorization.
a contributing factor is probably species differences in
albumin, which results in different binding properties to insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  [3]. the species variation highlights the importance of
performing dose–response investigations when comparing in
vivo effects of  xxxd2361xxx  with those of other insulin
molecules.
 xxxd2364xxx , insulin aspart and  xxxd2361xxx  are
distinct ligands. when present together, these ligands will
compete for the  xxxg1194xxx . therefore, we also evaluated
the effects of simultaneous presence of  xxxd2361xxx  and
 xxxd2364xxx  or insulin aspart. the studies of combined
effect of  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx /insulin aspart show
additive effects, both in vitro and in vivo. the clinical relevance
of these results is that one can expect additive effects of insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  with endogenous insulin and when combining insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  with prandial insulin therapy.
in summary, our data show that it is complicated to predict
the degree of right-shift among different conditions, in vitro
ranging from 0.76% (0.67–0.86% ci) relative affinity for
 xxxd2361xxx  in the rat lipogenesis assay at 1% hsa to 7%
(5.2–9.4% ci) relative affinity for  xxxd2361xxx  in the human
liver membrane assay, and in vivo ranging from approximately
10% in rat in this study to approximately 100% in pig and dog
as observed previously elsewhere [16,19].
in conclusion,  xxxd2361xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx  displace
labelled insulin to an indistinguishable extent. correspondingly, comparable maximal effects on lipogenesis and glucose
metabolism are observed. depending on the experimental in
vitro or in vivo conditions, a different degree of right-shift for
 xxxd2361xxx ’s concentration/dose–response is observed.

therefore, for both in vitro and in vivo models, we strongly recommend to establish always full concentration/dose–response
relationships when characterizing  xxxd2361xxx .
