 xxxg1737xxx  requires a
co-chaperone for signalling in uterine biology
and implantation
dr dey’s lifelong dedication is to deﬁne the roadmap to implantation. his group showed
that embryos cultured in small groups have superior growth to those cultured singly,
and that oestrogen is a critical determinant of uterine receptivity. his lab discovered that
 xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) is critical for ovulation, fertilization and implantation, and cox-2
derived prostacyclin mediates implantation via  xxxg1806xxx . dey’s group discovered that
cannabinoid receptor cb1/anandamide signalling is critical to implantation and oviductal
embryo transport. his group showed that a short delay in blastocyst attachment creates a
ripple effect leading to defective feto-placental development and pregnancy loss, indicating
early embryo-uterine interactions direct subsequent developmental programming.

abstract
embryo implantation is absolutely dependent on the preparation of the uterus to the receptive stage and attainment by the
blastocyst of implantation competency. co-ordinated effects of progesterone and oestrogen are essential for these processes
and determine the window of implantation. in rodents, a generalized stromal edema occurs before blastocyst attachment
followed by uterine luminal closure. this leads to apposition of the blastocyst trophectoderm against the luminal epithelium
and ultimately attachment. progesterone is essential for luminal closure, which must occur for successful implantation. more
importantly, progesterone is critical for almost every stage of pregnancy, including ovulation, fertilization, implantation,
decidualization and pregnancy maintenance. progesterone exerts its effects on target tissues primarily via nuclear progesterone
receptor (pr) whose optimal activity is potentiated by an immunophilin co-chaperone,  xxxd3271xxx  binding protein 4 ( xxxg799xxx ).
while mice lacking pr are infertile due to complete failure of ovulation, fertilization, and implantation, female mice with
targeted deletion of the  xxxg799xxx  gene are infertile speciﬁcally because of implantation failure resulting from compromised
uterine receptivity. this review highlights the evolution of knowledge about progesterone signalling during early pregnancy.
future studies are likely to provide a better understanding of  xxxg799xxx -pr signalling in promoting uterine receptivity for
implantation and may reveal new targets for improving infertility.

embryo-uterine interactions are
essential for implantation
synchronized development of the preimplantation embryo to
the blastocyst stage, escape of the blastocyst from the zona
pellucida and differentiation of the uterus to the receptive state
are all essential for the process of implantation (psychoyos,
1973; paria et al., 1993b). the implantation process is classiﬁed
into three stages: apposition, adhesion and attachment. in
rodents, a generalized stromal edema occurs before apposition.

this edema leads to closure of the uterine lumen, resulting in
interdigitation of microvilli of the blastocyst trophectoderm
and uterine luminal epithelium (apposition), followed by their
closer contact (adhesion) and ultimate attachment between
the blastocyst and the luminal surface. the establishment of
a differentiated uterus to support blastocyst development and
implantation depends primarily on the cell-speciﬁc coordinated
effects of oestrogen and progesterone (paria et al., 1993b).
priming of the uterus with progesterone alone is sufﬁcient for
uterine luminal closure, whereas attachment of the blastocyst
to the luminal surface requires the presence of both oestrogen

and progesterone.
in rodents, the ﬁrst conspicuous sign for the initiation of
implantation is an increased endometrial vascular permeability
at the sites of blastocysts. this process can be visualized as
discrete blue bands along the uterus after an intravenous injection
of a blue dye solution, such as chicago blue b. in mice, the
attachment reaction occurs in the evening (2200–2400 h) on day
4 of pregnancy (day 1 = vaginal plug) (das et al., 1994). the
attachment reaction is preceded by an intimate apposition of the
blastocyst trophectoderm with the uterine luminal epithelium
(psychoyos, 1973; schlafke and enders, 1975; enders, 1976;
das et al., 1994). following attachment, stromal cells at the
blastocyst site undergo proliferation and differentiation, a
process known as decidualization. this is accompanied by
luminal epithelial cell apoptosis at this site (parr et al., 1987),
leading to subsequent adherence and penetration by trophoblast
cells through the basement membrane into the stroma (paria et
al., 2001; dey et al., 2004).

uterine receptivity for implantation
is regulated by ovarian steroid
hormones
the uterus is comprised of heterogeneous cell types that respond
differentially to oestrogen and progesterone. for a successful
pregnancy to occur, the fertilized and developing embryo must
transit to the uterus, establish intimate contact with uterine
tissues, be nurtured through embryogenesis, and be delivered
at birth. in the mouse, oestrogen stimulates the proliferation
and differentiation of luminal and glandular epithelia, whereas
in the stroma these processes require both progesterone and
oestrogen (psychoyos, 1973; huet et al., 1989). on day 1 of
pregnancy, uterine epithelial cells undergo proliferation under
the inﬂuence of pre-ovulatory ovarian oestrogen secretion. this
secretion directs epithelial cell proliferation through day 2 of
pregnancy. rising concentrations of progesterone secreted from
newly formed corpora lutea initiate stromal cell proliferation
from day 3 onward. this stromal cell proliferation is further
stimulated by a small amount of oestrogen secreted on the
morning of day 4 of pregnancy. these co-ordinated effects of
oestrogen and progesterone result in the cessation of uterine
epithelial cell proliferation and initiate differentiation (huet et
al., 1989). during normal pregnancy, the presence of an active
blastocyst in the uterus is stimulus for the implantation reaction.
after the attachment reaction is initiated on day 4 (2200h2400h), stromal cells surrounding the implanting blastocyst
begin to proliferate extensively and differentiate into decidual
cells (huet et al., 1989). in pseudopregnant mice (females
mated with vasectomized males), the steroid hormonal milieu
within the uterus is similarly maintained. thus, sensitivity
of the pseudopregnant uterus to implantation on days 1–4 of
pregnancy is quite similar to normal pregnancy.

652

uterine sensitivity is classiﬁed into prereceptive, receptive and
non-receptive (refractory) phases, as deﬁned by embryo transfer
experiments in pseudopregnant mice (psychoyos, 1973; paria
et al., 1993a). uterine receptivity occurs for a limited period
only during pregnancy or pseudopregnancy and is regulated
by uterine responses to steroid hormones. the prereceptive
uterus on days 1–3 becomes fully receptive on day 4 (the day of

implantation), while by late day 5, the uterus becomes refractory
and fails to initiate implantation after blastocyst transfer (paria
et al., 1993a). blastocyst transfer into the uterine lumen on
day 4 of pseudopregnancy provokes normal implantation and
subsequent decidualization. without the presence of blastocyst
stimulation, pseudopregnancy terminates and the oestrous cycle
resumes. the concentration of oestrogen within a very narrow
range determines the duration of the window of receptivity.
indeed, the mouse uterus is rendered receptive to blastocyst
implantation if exposed to a small amount of oestrogen after 24–
48 h of progesterone priming (huet-hudson, 1990). although
blastocysts are the normal inducers of implantation events,
various non-speciﬁc stimuli, such as intraluminal infusion of
oil, air or mechanical stimuli can also initiate certain aspects
of the decidual cell reaction in pseudopregnant or steroid
hormonally prepared uteri (dey, 1996).
in mice and rats, ovariectomy before the preimplantation
oestrogen secretion on the morning of day 4 of pregnancy
induces delayed implantation (yoshinaga, 1958; yoshinaga
and adams, 1966). this status can be maintained for many
days with continuous progesterone treatment. during this
time, blastocysts undergo zona hatching at a slower pace and
remain dormant without initiating the attachment reaction in
the quiescent uterus. a single injection of oestrogen promptly
induces activation of blastocysts with the initiation of the
attachment reaction. a recent global gene expression study
shows that active and dormant blastocysts are different at the
molecular and physiological level (hamatani et al., 2004),
suggesting that a complex network of signalling pathways
regulates blastocyst dormancy and activation.

progesterone: discovering the
‘pregnancy hormone’
ovarian progesterone conditions the mouse uterus for
implantation and is required for pregnancy maintenance in
all eutherians studied. however, while ovarian oestrogen is
essential for blastocyst implantation in the progesterone-primed
uterus in mice and rats, it is not essential for implantation in
pigs, guinea pigs, rabbits or hamsters (dey et al., 2004). one
reason for this could be that while pig and rabbit blastocysts
can synthesize their own oestrogen, mouse embryos lack
such machinery. for human implantation, while progesterone
is essential, it remains unclear whether ovarian oestrogen is
an absolute requirement. the diverse actions of progesterone
include balancing the effects of oestrogen, regulating uterine
smooth muscle contraction until labour, and modulating
maternal immunological surveillance towards the embryo.
since the discovery of the corpus luteum in 1672 by regner
de graaf, a dutch scientist whose namesake was given to the
antral follicle, much work followed to characterize the role of
this structure during pregnancy. de graaf recognized that the
presence of the corpus luteum was associated with pregnancy
(corner, 1943, 1974) and until 1900, many functions for the
corpus luteum were proposed. one group postulated that its
function was to prevent ovulation during pregnancy (auguste
prenant, france), while another group postulated its involvement
in preparing the endometrium for implantation (gustav born,
germany) (frobenius, 1999). prior to his death, gustav born
had a revelation that the corpus luteum must secrete some

article - understanding  xxxg1737xxx  signalling - s tranguch et al.
substance, perhaps to protect the early embryo and support
implantation (corner et al., 1974). in 1900, ludwig fraenkel, a
disciple of born, examined his hypothesis and provided proof
for an endocrine function of the corpus luteum, an amazing
triumph considering the terms ‘hormone’ or ‘endocrinology’
had not yet been coined. in these experiments, fraenkel used
the rabbit as an animal model, a useful model since rabbits will
only ovulate post-mating and embryos reside in the oviducts
and uterus for about one week before implantation. fraenkel
found that pregnancy loss occurred if he removed the corpora
lutea within those seven days post-mating (fraenkel, 1903). it
was also at this time that paul ancel and paul bouin found that
the corpus luteum was responsible for changes occurring in
the endometrium in both pregnant and pseudopregnant rabbits
(bouin and ancel, 1910). from these experiments, it became
clear that the corpus luteum secretes a substance that acts to
inﬂuence both the fate of the embryo and the integrity of the
uterus. in 1934, the successful puriﬁcation of progesterone
in its crystalline form was independently reported by several
groups (karl slotta, hans ruschig, eric fels of breslau; george
w corner sr. and willard allen of united states; and karl
butenandt and oskar wintersteiner of germany) (frobenius,
1999). interestingly, karl slotta, the leader of the breslau
group, was the son-in-law of ludwig fraenkel.
the discovery of progesterone coincided with experiments
by several groups showing that pituitary or ovarian extracts
injected into frogs stimulate ovulation (rugh, 1935; heilbrunn
et al., 1939; ryan, 1940; wright, 1945). in the late 1950s
and 1960s, while researchers began to determine roles for
progesterone ligand, gerald mueller and elwood jensen
discovered the  xxxg730xxx  (er) (fannon et al., 2001).
the ﬁeld of steroid hormone action quickly erupted when jack
gorski and angelo notides linked oestrogen action with uterine

protein synthesis (notides and gorski, 1966). the importance
of these ﬁndings was emphasized by the establishment of the
ﬁrst gordon conference on hormone action in 1969 (o’malley,
1995). soon after, nuclear  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) was the
ﬁrst steroid  xxxg1603xxx  to be puriﬁed from the chick
oviduct (o’malley et al., 1970) and then from humans (smith et
al., 1975). after puriﬁcation of pr, er and  xxxg183xxx ,
it was soon realized that steroid hormone receptors affect gene
transcription (schwartz et al., 1977). it was not until 1985,
however, with the advent of dna sequencing technology, that
the ﬁrst steroid  xxxg1603xxx ,  xxxg1601xxx , was
cloned (weinberger et al., 1985), and the cloning of the remaining
steroid hormone receptors followed shortly after (greene et
al., 1986; jeltsch et al., 1986; arriza et al., 1987; brinkmann
et al., 1989). since then, many researchers have devoted their
careers to delineating mechanisms of steroid  xxxg1603xxx 
signalling. a brief summary of major landmarks contributing
to the current knowledge of progesterone signalling, with an
emphasis on topics covered in this review, is shown (figure 1).

mechanism of progesterone
signalling
genes activated through pr include homeobox transcription
factors, growth factors and cytokines (dey et al., 2004).
deﬁnitive evidence for roles of these genes in implantation
and/or decidualization has been demonstrated with an array of
mouse gene knockout models. for instance, hoxa-10, which is
progesterone-inducible in uterine stromal cells, is required for
implantation and decidualization (lim et al., 1999). the variety
of gene targets affected by progesterone signalling demonstrates
the multifaceted roles of progesterone during pregnancy, one
being immunosuppression.

the chemical structure of progesterone is similar to antiinﬂammatory steroids, and progesterone has been shown to have
anti-inﬂammatory effects within and outside the uterus (wilder,
1996). in sheep, if corpora lutea are removed during early
pregnancy, a massive leukocyte invasion occurs, suggesting a
role for progesterone in suppressing such invasion (staples et
al., 1983). it has also been suggested that progesterone played
a role during evolution, adapting the inﬂammatory response
to implantation (finn, 1986). recent advances in technology
have allowed scientists to examine the molecular signalling
pathways involved during the attachment reaction that not only
encourage attachment but also allow for controlled trophoblast
invasion. not surprisingly, several signalling molecules known
to play roles in immunomodulation such as prostaglandins,
cytokines, leukaemia inhibitory factor and interleukins play
signiﬁcant roles during implantation (dey et al., 2004). various
non-speciﬁc stimuli, such as the intraluminal infusion of oil,
air or mechanical stimuli initiate certain aspects of the decidual
cell reaction in pseudopregnant uteri, demonstrating that the
blastocyst is not required to initiate proinﬂammatory reactions;
instead, it is progesterone that is required (dey, 1996). however,
if progesterone is withdrawn, a massive invasion of leukocytes
and breakdown of decidual tissue will occur. one proposed
explanation for this phenomenon is that there is an advantage in
preparing the uterus in anticipation of the blastocyst rather than
in response to the presence of blastocysts (finn, 1996).
progesterone mediates its responses primarily through its
nuclear pr to activate transcription of genes involved in early
pregnancy. two isoforms of pr are expressed from one single
gene: pra and prb. these two gene products are transcribed
from separate promoters on the same gene, with prb existing
as the longer of the two proteins (120 kda) compared with
pra (97 kda) (figure 2). the amino terminal portion of both
isoforms is the most hypervariable region and contains the
transactivation domains, af3 (prb only) and af1 (pra and
prb), responsible for the recruitment of coactivators and/or
corepressors during transcriptional regulation. the dnabinding domain (dbd) is the most conserved region, composed
of two type ii zinc ﬁnger structures responsible for binding
to speciﬁc cis-acting dna sequences (luisi et al., 1991;
freedman, 1992). the carboxyl terminal region contains the
ligand-binding domain (lbd) with an additional site, af2, for
interaction with transcriptional coregulators. pr interactions
with heat shock proteins and other chaperones localize to
the lbd/af2 (schowalter et al., 1991). the larger segment
of prb, referred to as the b upstream sequence (kelleher
et al., 1999), contains the af3 domain, which is thought to
attenuate prb activity. for this reason, prb tends to be less
transcriptionally active than the pra isoform. in fact, it is
thought that pra can act as a dominant repressor of prb, as
shown by coexpression studies in cultured cells (vegeto et al.,
1993; kraus et al., 1995). pra and prb proteins also respond
differentially to progesterone antagonists, e.g. ru-486, in that
antagonist-bound pra is inactive, while antagonist-bound prb
has increased transcriptional activity (conneely et al., 2001).
when expressed in equimolar concentrations in cells, pra and
prb can homodimerize or heterodimerize, essentially existing
as three entities: a:a, b:b, a:b. each entity will therefore
exhibit differential activity in regulating downstream target
genes.

654

mice lacking the pr gene encoding both isoforms have

illustrated the essential roles of progesterone signalling through
its nuclear steroid  xxxg1603xxx  during reproductive
processes (table 1). female mice lacking both pr isoforms
have complete ovulation, fertilization and implantation failure
as well as impaired sexual behaviour, defective responses to
gonadotrophins, and defective ductal branching morphogenesis
and lobuloalveolar differentiation of the mammary gland
(lydon et al., 1995; chappell et al., 1997). progesterone
signalling through pr has also been shown to play a role in
decidualization and maintaining the uterus in a quiescent state
until delivery (dey et al., 2004). mouse models lacking either
pra or prb have been generated using the cre-loxp system to
introduce a point mutation at either of the two atg translation
initiation codons (mulac-jericevic et al., 2000, 2003). while
pra null female mice are infertile due to severe abnormalities
in ovarian and uterine function but with normal mammary
gland function, prb null female mice show no apparent defects
in ovarian and uterine function but have signiﬁcantly reduced
mammary ductal side-branching and alveologenesis during
pregnancy (table 1). these ﬁndings suggest that pra and prb
act in a tissue-selective manner to regulate their speciﬁc actions,
and also imply that pra:prb heterodimers are not required for
uterine reproductive events. generation of speciﬁc agonists and
antagonists to pra and prb will allow us to further investigate
the contribution of each pr isoform during early pregnancy.
it is also thought that progesterone can signal through a membrane
receptor; however, the contribution of this signalling pathway
to speciﬁc physiological processes has not been demonstrated
conclusively. a role for this signalling was ﬁrst shown in
xenopus oocytes. quiescent xenopus oocytes remain arrested
in meiosis i until exposed to progesterone, which triggers rapid
non-transcriptional responses rather than the conventional
transcriptional activation known to be a signature of nuclear
steroid  xxxg1603xxx  signalling. using the xenopus model,
tian and colleagues identiﬁed xpr1 as a membrane pr
necessary for xenopus oocyte activation (tian et al., 2000).
zhu and colleagues cloned a membrane progestin receptor
from spotted sea trout ovaries, characterizing it as a g-protein
coupled receptor expressed solely in the brain and reproductive
organs that activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk)
signalling pathways upon progestin binding (zhu et al., 2003).
since then, three forms of putative membrane-bound progestin
receptors have been identiﬁed in channel catﬁsh (mpralpha, beta,
and gamma) (kazeto et al., 2005), and another group has identiﬁed
an adrenal cortex protein, inner zone antigen (izag), as a
putative membrane pr (raza et al., 2001). in the mouse, two
potential membrane prs are thought to play roles particularly
in ovarian cells: membrane  xxxg1737xxx  (mpr) and
pgr membrane component 1 (pgrmc1) (zhu et al., 2003;
peluso et al., 2006). while mprs and pgrmc1 are expressed
in various cell types of the ovary, their roles in ovarian biology
remain to be determined (peluso et al., 2006). whether a role
for these membrane prs exists in uterine biology also remains
unexplored.

immunophilins and steroid receptor
signalling
immunophilins are so-named due to their ability to bind and
mediate the actions of certain immunosuppressive drugs.
immunophilins are grouped into two protein families: the

fk506-binding proteins (fkbp) and the  xxxd1781xxx  binding
proteins termed cyclophilins (cyp). fkbp and cyp typically
exhibit peptidylprolyl cis–trans isomerase (ppiase) activity, and
the ppiase domain also forms the drug-binding site (fanghanel
and fischer, 2004). some members of the fkbp and cyp
families contain a tetratricopeptide repeat (tpr) domain that
targets binding to the highly conserved c-terminus of heat
shock protein 90 (hsp90), and thus participate as co-chaperones
with hsp90 in its substrate interactions.  xxxg799xxx ,  xxxg799xxx , and
cyp40 are three such tpr-containing co-chaperones that have
been identiﬁed in steroid receptor complexes (smith, 2004).
as with other steroid receptors, pr assembles with chaperones
in an ordered, multi-step manner in preparation for binding
hormone (pratt and toft, 1997; smith, 2000). the ﬁnal assembly
stage involves direct association of hsp90 with the pr lbd,
which stabilizes pr’s ability to bind progesterone (smith, 1993).
at this mature assembly stage, the fkbp and other tpr cochaperones dynamically exchange on hsp90 such that there is a
mixture of receptor complexes distinguished by which tpr cochaperone is associated with hsp90; moreover the equilibrium
distribution of co-chaperones in these complexes is distinct for
each steroid receptor (barent et al., 1998; riggs et al., 2004).
hormone binding stimulates interruption of the receptor/
chaperone assembly cycle and promotes receptor activation
as a transcription factor. recent ﬁndings demonstrate that cochaperones can have unique inﬂuences on steroid receptor
function. for example,  xxxg799xxx  potentiates the responses of
pr,  xxxg183xxx , and  xxxg1601xxx  to hormone
(riggs et al., 2003; cheung-flynn et al., 2005; tranguch et al.,
2005), whereas  xxxg799xxx  can attenuate hormonal responsiveness
(reynolds et al., 1999; hubler et al., 2003; riggs et al., 2003).
 xxxg730xxx  activity is unaffected by either fkbp even

though both can assemble with  xxxg730xxx  complexes.
since  xxxg799xxx  gene expression is inducible by progesterone
and other steroids (hubler et al., 2003), there appears to be
a feedback mechanism to down-modulate steroid receptor
activity through increasing  xxxg799xxx  concentrations relative to
 xxxg799xxx  (riggs et al., 2004).
the mechanism by which  xxxg799xxx  potentiates receptor
hormone-binding ability is still unclear. point mutation of the
 xxxg799xxx  tpr domain demonstrates that an association of
 xxxg799xxx  with hsp90 is critical (riggs et al., 2003), suggesting
that  xxxg799xxx  is obligatorily recruited to the receptor complex
by hsp90. in addition, point mutation of the  xxxg799xxx  ppiase
domain or the ppiase inhibitor fk506 blocks receptor
potentiation, which perhaps reﬂects a direct interaction between
the ppiase domain and receptor sites.  xxxg799xxx  and  xxxg799xxx 
have similar ppiase activity towards small peptide substrates
(pirkl and buchner, 2001), and the respective ppiase domains
share 80% sequence similarity, yet  xxxg799xxx  fails to potentiate
receptor activity. chimeric constructs in which the ppiase
domain has been exchanged conﬁrm that the  xxxg799xxx  ppiase
domain is unique in its ability to stimulate receptor activity
(riggs et al., 2003); mapping of speciﬁc amino acid differences
within the ppiase domain should provide further insight into
the mechanism of receptor potentiation. the receptor site(s)
putatively targeted by the  xxxg799xxx  ppiase domain have not been
identiﬁed but localize to the lbd (riggs et al., 2003). there
is additional evidence that  xxxg799xxx , through a dynein-binding
ability lacking in  xxxg799xxx , can enhance nuclear translocation
of hormone-bound  xxxg1601xxx  (davies et al., 2002;
pratt et al., 2004; wochnik et al., 2005); however it is not yet
clear what contribution dynein associations play relative to
direct fkbp-mediated effects on hormone binding, especially

655

with pr and other receptors that prior to hormone binding have
a more predominant nuclear-localization than the glucocorticoid
receptor.

656

the physiological relevance of fkbp co-chaperones in some
steroid-dependent tissues has been conﬁrmed by mouse gene
knockout models. the infertile phenotype of  xxxg799xxx  null
mice implicates its important role in reproductive functions,
while  xxxg799xxx  null mice display no obvious reproductive
defects. speciﬁcally,  xxxg799xxx  null males display developmental
defects in external genitalia and secondary sex organs, which
relates with reduced responsiveness of  xxxg183xxx  to
androgens, while  xxxg799xxx  null females have morphologically
normal reproductive tracts but cannot sustain pregnancy, which
relates to pr resistance to progesterone (cheung-flynn et al.,
2005; tranguch et al., 2005). therefore,  xxxg799xxx ’s function as
a co-chaperone for pr combined with the infertile phenotype of
the null female mouse provides evidence for a critical role for
this immunophilin in implantation and early pregnancy.

increased endometrial vascular permeability solely at the site
of the blastocyst. at this stage,  xxxg799xxx  and pr are primarily
expressed in the stroma surrounding the implanting blastocyst
(tranguch et al., 2005). in mice, proliferating and differentiating
stromal cells surrounding the implanting blastocyst initiate the
formation of the primary decidual zone (pdz) on the afternoon
of day 5. the avascular pdz is packed with decidual cells and
by day 6, the pdz is well established with the formation of a
secondary decidual zone (sdz) around the pdz. at this point,
cell proliferation is absent in the pdz, but continues in the sdz
(dey et al., 2004), although a thin layer of undifferentiated
stromal cells establishes a boundary between the myometrium
and the sdz. the pdz progressively degenerates until day 8.
from day 8 onward, placental and embryonic growth gradually
replaces the sdz, which is reduced to a thin layer of cells called
the decidua capsularis (dey et al., 2004). on day 8,  xxxg799xxx  is
primarily expressed in the sdz and the undifferentiated stroma
situated between the deciduum and myometrium (daikoku et
al., 2005).

uterine  xxxg799xxx  expression during
early pregnancy

uterine-speciﬁc phenotype of
 xxxg799xxx  null mice

with respect to uterine biology, the co-chaperone  xxxg799xxx  was
originally identiﬁed through proteomics analysis as a protein
down-regulated in uteri of hoxa10 null mice, suggesting its
important role as a signalling molecule regulating stromal cell
function (daikoku et al., 2005). hoxa-10 is an abdominal b-like
homeobox gene whose role in development has been deﬁned by
gene-targeting experiments (rijli et al., 1995; satokata et al.,
1995). female mice lacking hoxa-10 exhibit infertility, with
the proximal region of the uterus showing partial homeosis into
an oviduct-like structure. however, the cause of infertility in
these females is not due to this homeosis, but instead due to
impaired stromal cell proliferation and decidualization (benson
et al., 1996). embryo transfer experiments have shown the
importance of maternal hoxa-10 in both implantation and
decidualization (satokata et al., 1995; lim et al., 1999). more
speciﬁcally, stromal cell proliferation in hoxa-10 null mice
in response to ovarian progesterone and oestrogen is severely
compromised, while epithelial cell proliferation remains normal
in response to oestrogen (lim et al., 1999). the speciﬁcity of
stromal cell responsiveness to progesterone as the defect in this
mouse model implies a critical role for hoxa-10 in mediating
progesterone effects during implantation, especially during
decidualization.

 xxxg799xxx  acts as a co-chaperone to potentiate nuclear pr function,
but it is surprising to note that the phenotype of  xxxg799xxx  null
females differs dramatically from pr null females (tranguch
et al., 2005) (table 1). whereas pr null females have both
severely compromised ovarian and uterine functions resulting
in infertility, the infertility phenotype in  xxxg799xxx  null females is
speciﬁcally due to compromised uterine functions. speciﬁcally,
whereas pr null females have complete ovulation, fertilization
and implantation failure,  xxxg799xxx  null females on a c57bl/6
background have complete implantation failure with normal
ovulation and suboptimal fertilization (table 1). a reason for
this difference could be due to basal pr activity existing in the
 xxxg799xxx  null females, whereas no pr activity exists in the pr
null female. studies are currently ongoing in the laboratory to
address this question. the fact that the infertile phenotype of
 xxxg799xxx  null females is due speciﬁcally to implantation and
not to defects in ovulation and/or fertilization also suggests
differential sensitivity of the ovary and uterus to fkbp52mediated progesterone action. the phenotype of  xxxg799xxx  null
females establishes this mouse model as a useful tool to study
progesterone-regulated events during early pregnancy.

during studies identifying  xxxg799xxx  as a downstream target
of hoxa10, a unique temporal and cell-speciﬁc expression
of  xxxg799xxx  in the mouse uterus was found during the periimplantation period, suggesting that this immunophilin cochaperone is intimately involved with the dynamic changes
that occur during implantation (daikoku et al., 2005). on day
1 of pregnancy, when the uterus is mainly under the inﬂuence
of pre-ovulatory oestrogen,  xxxg799xxx  is localized to the luminal
epithelium, whereas on day 4 the expression expands into the
stroma with its persistent expression in the luminal and glandular
epithelia. on day 4 of pregnancy,  xxxg799xxx  expression overlaps
with that of pr in the stroma underlying the luminal epithelium
(tranguch et al., 2005). on the morning of day 5, the attachment
between the luminal epithelium and blastocyst trophectoderm is
in the early stage with continued stromal cell proliferation and

many progesterone-regulated genes are not detectable in the
 xxxg799xxx  null female mouse on day 4 of pregnancy when the
uterus is primarily under progesterone dominance (figure
3a, (tranguch et al., 2005). such progesterone-regulated
genes include  xxxg185xxx  ( xxxg185xxx ), hoxa-10, indian hedgehog
(ihh) and  xxxg1040xxx  (hdc).  xxxg185xxx  is a
glycosylated heparin-binding protein that comprises a member
of the  xxxg681xxx  (egf) family. under the inﬂuence
of progesterone,  xxxg185xxx  is expressed in the luminal and glandular
epithelium (das et al., 1995), and is regulated by progesterone
working through the pra isoform (mulac-jericevic et al., 2003).
while it has been suggested that  xxxg185xxx  is necessary
for uterine cell-speciﬁc differentiation and proliferation, mice
lacking the  xxxg185xxx  gene appear to have normal fertility (luetteke
et al., 1999). this could result from compensation by other egf
family members, but precludes the conclusion that  xxxg185xxx 
is essential for successful implantation.

components of the hedgehog signalling pathway have also
been shown to be inﬂuenced by progesterone, speciﬁcally
those of the indian hedgehog (ihh) signalling pathway
including the hedgehog-binding receptor, patched, and the
downstream transcription factors,  xxxg897xxx –3 (matsumoto et
al., 2002). expression of ihh increases in the luminal and
glandular epithelium from day 3 of pregnancy onward.
during the same time, the expression of its receptor and
downstream transcription factors is up-regulated in the
underlying stroma. this suggests that ihh functions as a
paracrine growth factor for stromal cell proliferation during
early pregnancy. while roles for hedgehog signalling have
been delineated in cancer, deﬁnitive roles for this conserved
signalling pathway in uterine biology have yet to be
determined. another progesterone-regulated gene is histidine
decarboxylase. this gene is regulated by progesterone working
speciﬁcally through the prb isoform (mulac-jericevic et al.,
2000) and is expressed primarily in the epithelium on day 4
of pregnancy (paria et al., 1998). the lack of expression of
progesterone-regulated genes on day 4 of pregnancy (figure
3a), the normal uterine expression of pr and comparable
concentrations of serum progesterone in  xxxg799xxx  null mice
compared with those of wild-type mice (figure 3a and
b) conﬁrm the role of  xxxg799xxx  in potentiating pr activity
(tranguch et al., 2005).

there is increasing evidence that mutation of a gene often results
in substantially altered phenotypes depending on the genetic
background of mice in which the mutation is maintained. for
instance, cox-2 null mice differ in phenotype depending on the
genetic background (wang et al., 2003). also, epidermalgrowth
factor receptor (egfr) deﬁciency on a cf1 background results
in peri-implantation death caused by degeneration of the inner
cell mass, but this deﬁciency on a 129/sv background results
in placental defects giving rise to mid-gestational embryonic
lethality. egfr mutation on a cd1 background, however,
causes early post-natal lethality with abnormal skin, kidney,
brain, liver, and gastrointestinal tract functions (threadgill et
al., 1995). other groups have also shown variable phenotypes
in mice with different genetic backgrounds for deﬁciencies in
 xxxg2269xxx  (bonyadi et al., 1997), leptin
(ewart-toland et al., 1999) and centromere  xxxg1649xxx  (fowler
et al., 2000). these differential effects are postulated to involve
modiﬁer genes (dietrich et al., 1993; bonyadi et al., 1997),
although experimental identiﬁcation of such modiﬁer genes
remains largely unknown. however, from these studies, it is
obvious that the availability of null mice in different strains
strengthens the characterization of the phenotype. it will
be exciting to observe whether the uterine-speciﬁc infertile
phenotype of  xxxg799xxx  null mice is maintained on different
genetic backgrounds.

concluding remarks
since the discovery of progesterone in 1934, much progress has
been made concerning its roles during early pregnancy. in fact,
a wealth of knowledge on the roles of growth factors, cytokines,
homeotic genes, transcription factors and lipid mediators
governed by progesterone during implantation and early
pregnancy has since been generated. still, their hierarchical
blueprint in directing uterine and embryonic functions
during implantation remains to be deciphered. generation
of mouse models has provided invaluable clues to the roles
of ovarian steroid hormones oestrogen and progesterone on
their signalling pathways. complete ovarian, fertilization and
implantation failure in mice deﬁcient in pr preclude the ability
to investigate the role of progesterone signalling during early
pregnancy. however, the uterine-speciﬁc phenotype of  xxxg799xxx 
null females provides a unique model to investigate changes
occurring during early pregnancy when the uterus is under
compromised pr function.
steroid action during early pregnancy is an important avenue
of research because of the persistent low pregnancy success
rates (~30%) in human ivf programmes. one cause of reduced
pregnancy rates is transfer of ivf-derived embryos into nonreceptive uteri caused by high oestrogen concentrations from
ovarian stimulation for retrieving multiple eggs (pellicer et al.,
1996; simon et al., 1998). concentrations of oestrogen must
be tightly controlled for successful implantation to occur (ma
et al., 2003). in fact, there is evidence that ovarian stimulation
leads to implantation failure and embryonic resorption in
mice (walton et al., 1982; ertzeid and storeng, 2001). this
remarkable sensitivity of the uterus to oestrogen is illustrated in
the  xxxg799xxx  null model, which exhibits exaggerated oestrogen
inﬂuence, as determined by expression of an oestrogenresponsive gene lactoferrin ( xxxg1348xxx )
 xxxg1348xxx ) on day 4 of pregnancy, due
 xxxg1348xxx 
to compromised progesterone action (figure 3c). this mouse
model therefore demonstrates the importance of maintaining a
tight balance between oestrogen and progesterone action in the
uterus and has potential to uncover downstream targets to help
improve fertility and pregnancy rates in ivf programmes.
