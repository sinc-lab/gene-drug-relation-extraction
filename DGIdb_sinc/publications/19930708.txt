abstract
background: recent evidence suggests that estrogen signaling may be involved in the
pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). aromatase is an enzyme complex that
catalyses the final step in estrogen synthesis and is present in several tissues, including the lung. in
the current study we investigated the activity of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane in human
nsclc cell lines  xxxd1322xxx  and a549.
results: aromatase expression was detected in both cell lines.  xxxd1322xxx  cells showed lower protein
and mrna levels of aromatase, compared to a549 cells. exemestane decreased cell proliferation
and increased apoptosis in both cell lines, 48 h after its application, with a549 exhibiting higher
sensitivity than  xxxd1322xxx  cells. aromatase protein and mrna levels were not affected by exemestane
in a549 cells, whereas an increase in both protein and mrna levels was observed in  xxxd1322xxx  cells, 48
h after exemestane application. moreover, an increase in camp levels was found in both cell lines,
15 min after the administration of exemestane. in addition, we studied the effect of exemestane on
 xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr) localization and activation. exemestane increased egfr
activation 15 min after its application in  xxxd1322xxx  cells. furthermore, we demonstrated a translocation
of egfr from cell membrane, 24 h after the addition of exemestane in  xxxd1322xxx  cells. no changes in
egfr activation or localization were observed in a549 cells.
conclusion: our findings suggest an antiproliferative effect of exemestane on nsclc cell lines.
exemestane may be more effective in cells with higher aromatase levels. further studies are needed
to assess the activity of exemestane in nsclc.

background
lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality for both men and women in the united states and

non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) accounts for 80% of
all cases. the etiology of nsclc has not yet been efficiently elucidated. recent evidence suggests that estrogen

signaling is critical for the progression of malignancies
that express estrogen receptors (er) and may also be
involved in the pathogenesis of nsclc [1-7]. in a recent
review, dubey et al [8] suggest that a number of principles
related to the pathogenesis or even the management of
the disease, may apply to both breast and lung carcinoma.
despite previous conflicting data, recent studies have
indicated that estrogen receptors alpha ( xxxg730xxx ) and beta
( xxxg731xxx ) are overexpressed in certain proportions of malignant lung cells [3,5-7,9]. moreover, stimulation of cell
proliferation with estrogens has been reported in lung
cancer tissue cultures, further supporting the potential
biologic role of ers in lung carcinogenesis [3-6]. a difference of er expression between men and women has been
reported in lung cancer by fasco et al, who found higher
levels of er in female patients [10]. in addition, women
with lung cancer have also higher levels of estrogens compared to healthy females of the same age [11]. it has been
hypothesized that estrogens may interact with carcinogenic components of tobacco, affecting the risk for lung
cancer development. a positive association between exogenous and endogenous exposure to estrogens and the
development of lung adenocarcinoma has been described
in women [1], even though other studies have failed to
show such a correlation [12]. furthermore, hormone
replacement therapy has been associated with shorter survival in lung cancer patients [11,13]. recent data have also
provided evidence for an association between estrogen
levels and outcome, and this correlation may possibly
contribute to the survival advantage seen in older women
with nsclc [14].
given the accumulating data relating to the significance of
hormonal pathways in nsclc, a role for antiestrogen
treatments in the management of the disease should not
be excluded. although tamoxifen has been evaluated in
combination with chemotherapy in patients with nsclc
[15,16], the agonistic activity of this agent on the er
might limit its usefulness in lung cancer [3,4,11]. moreover, clinical studies using tamoxifen in breast cancer
patients have not shown a reduction in lung cancer incidence [17].  xxxd2165xxx  is a pure antiestrogen which has
shown antiproliferative activity in estrogen-induced
growth of lung cancer cells [3,5]. in view of a possible
functional interaction between the er and the epidermal
growth factor receptor (egfr) pathways in nsclc,  xxxd2165xxx  has also been evaluated in combination with
egfr tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (tkis), both in nsclc
xenografts [4,9] and in women with nsclc [18], with
promising results. similar studies evaluating the combination of  xxxd2165xxx  with other tkis are under way.
assuming that lung cancer is responsive to hormonal
manipulations, another modality to alter estrogen signal-

ing could be via estrogen synthesis inhibition. aromatase
is a cytochrome p450 enzyme complex that mediates the
final, rate-limiting step in estrogen synthesis. more specifically, aromatase catalyzes three consecutive hydroxylation reactions converting c19 androgens to aromatic c18
estrogens. upon receiving electrons from nadph-cytochrome p450 reductase, aromatase converts androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and estradiol,
respectively [19]. apart from its expression in the ovaries,
the enzyme is also present in other tissues such as breast,
lung, liver and brain. aromatase expression has been
recently demonstrated in nsclc tumour specimens [5,7],
which could represent a local source of estrogen production in lung cancer tissue in both genders.
aromatase inhibitors (ais) might also be effective in
nsclc by reducing the biosynthesis of estrogens and
thereby inhibiting estrogen-depended pathways in lung
tumours. currently, there are two classes of third-generation aromatase inhibitors: reversible nonsteroidal inhibitors, such as anastrozole and letrozole, and irreversible
steroidal inactivators, such as exemestane. exemestane
inhibits aromatization in vivo by about 98 percent in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. in the adjuvant setting, switching to exemestane after 2-3 years of adjuvant
tamoxifen was more effective than continuing tamoxifen
[20]. in this trial, patients assigned to exemestane displayed a trend of lower incidence of subsequent primary
lung cancer compared to those maintained on tamoxifen
(4 vs 12).
in the current study, we investigated the anti-tumour
activity of exemestane in lung cancer cell lines  xxxd1322xxx  and
a549 on cell proliferation and apoptosis. in addition, we
examined the effect of exemestane on aromatase activity
and expression levels. we also tested the hypothesis that
exemestane might exert its effect on aromatase activity
through a camp-dependent mechanism. finally, we evaluated the effect of exemestane on egfr localization and
activation.

results
in vitro experiments were performed in two nsclc cell
lines,  xxxd1322xxx  and a549. both cell lines express  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx 
[3,5,7].  xxxd1322xxx  cells express higher levels of  xxxg730xxx  compared
to a549 cells, whereas the latter cell line expresses higher
levels of  xxxg731xxx  compared to  xxxd1322xxx  cells [7].
aromatase expression in  xxxd1322xxx  and a549 cells
a549 cells express higher protein and mrna aromatase
levels than  xxxd1322xxx  cells (fig. 1 and fig. 2). aromatase activity
was detected in both cell lines. exemestane did not affect
protein nor mrna levels of aromatase in a549 cells, 48 h
after its application. in contrast, protein and mrna levels

1 and fig. 2).
exemestane inhibited  xxxd1322xxx  and a549 cell growth and
increased apoptosis
we studied the effect of exemestane on the proliferation
of the human nsclc cell lines,  xxxd1322xxx  and a549. exemestane inhibited cell proliferation in both cell lines in a dose
dependent manner, 48 h after its application (fig. 3a).
fifty percent growth inhibition was recorded at 50 mum for
 xxxd1322xxx  and 20 mum for a549. all further experiments for each
cell line were performed with these concentrations of
exemestane. moreover, evaluating the effect of testosterone on proliferation of  xxxd1322xxx  and a549 cells, we found that
testosterone did not affect cell proliferation at lower doses
whereas it decreased cell number at higher doses (fig. 3b).

furthermore, the percentage of annexin+ cells increased 48
h after treatment of  xxxd1322xxx  or a549 with exemestane compared to untreated cells (fig. 4). although there are data
regarding cell cycle arrest by aromatase inhibitors in
breast cancer cells [21], a similar effect was not found with
exemestane in nsclc cell lines in our study (data not
shown).
aromatase activity in  xxxd1322xxx  and a549 cells
as aromatase catalyses the conversion of androstenedione
and testosterone to estrone and estradiol, respectively, its

activity was determined by the production of estradiol
after treatment of cells with exemestane.  xxxd1322xxx  and a549
cells were treated with exemestane without exogenous
addition of testosterone at the indicated concentrations,
and 15 min later estradiol production was measured. previous reports have indicated that the estimated time for
achieving 50% of aromatase inhibition by exemestane is
13.9 min [19,22]. we found that a 15 min treatment with
exemestane caused a non-significant reduction of estradiol levels in both cell lines (fig. 5a). however, estradiol
levels were increased 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h later in both
cell lines (fig. 5a).
furthermore, aromatase activity was determined at 6, 8,
12 and 24 h, following treatment of both cell lines with 1
mum testosterone. this experiment was used as an internal
control. the time point of 15 min was not used since there
are previous data showing that in breast cancer cells, aromatase is activated 6 h after incubation with a suitable
substrate [23]. as was expected, we found that application
of testosterone increased the levels of estradiol (fig. 5b),
with the maximum production of estradiol being
observed 12 h after treatment of cells with the substrate.
camp levels in  xxxd1322xxx  and a549 cells
evaluating the effect of exemestane on camp levels, we
found an increase of camp levels in both cell lines, 15 min
after treatment of cells with exemestane. this effect was

cancer cells may use estrogens produced via aromatase as
a way to maintain or even increase the er signaling [24].
we have also found that exemestane inhibited cell proliferation in both cell lines in a dose dependent manner and
apoptosis was increased without affecting cell cycle. previous reports have indicated that ais such as anastrozole
and letrozole may inhibit proliferation of the breast cancer cell line mcf-7 through induction of apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest [21].

egfr localization (fig. 7) or phosphorylation (data not

with exemestane. however, in  xxxd1322xxx  cells we found a translocation of egfr from the cell membrane, 24 h after the
addition of exemestane (fig. 7). moreover, we demonstrated an increase in egfr activation, 15 min after treatment of  xxxd1322xxx  cells with exemestane (fig. 8a and 8b). egfr
activation was detected using an elisa kit assay (fig. 8a),
and the results were confirmed by immunoblot analysis
(fig. 8b).

discussion
in the current study, we evaluated the activity of exemestane in nsclc cell lines  xxxd1322xxx  and a549. our results are in
agreement with previous studies [5,7] which have
reported that aromatase is expressed by nsclc cells. lung

in order to determine the effective dose of exemestane
regarding cell proliferation, a set of dose dependent experiments were performed. the dose dependent curves
revealed that 50% growth inhibition was recorded at 50
mum for  xxxd1322xxx  and 20 mum for a549 cells. although the
selected concentrations seem to be high, similar concentrations of an ai have also been used in previous studies
for in vitro experiments [7,25]. the dose of exemestane
currently used in clinical practice is 25 mg daily. exemestane exhibits an excellent safety profile in humans, having
no significant toxicity at doses up to 600 mg/day and it is
exceptionally well tolerated. the maximum tolerated dose
and dose limiting toxicities have yet to be identified [26].
at a single dose of 25 mg, the average peak plasma level is
18 ng/ml (approximately 0.06 nm), within 2 h post dosing. this concentration is clearly lower compared to our in
vitro experimental model, as well as to the majority of
other in vitro experimental models. however, the aim of
our study was to focus on the effect of exemestane on aromatase activity and egfr signalling, when used at a dose
with a significant effect on lung cancer cell proliferation.
in another study which also investigated the efficacy of an
ai in nsclc, aromatase activity was inhibited by anastrozole in nsclc cell lines, and treatment of tumour cells
with anastrozole led to suppression of cell growth [7]. it is
of interest that the use of an aromatase inhibitor has the
same effect on cell growth despite the different nature of
the inhibitors used. in fact, anastrozole is a reversible nonsteroidal inhibitor whereas exemestane is an irreversible
steroidal inactivator. in addition, our data provide information with respect to the effect of exemestane on protein
and mrna levels of aromatase in nsclc cell lines.
previous data regarding the effect of estradiol on the proliferation of  xxxd1322xxx  and a549 cells are contradictory. when
estradiol was used at concentrations up to 1 mum, no effect
on cell proliferation was demonstrated [27]. in contrast,
estradiol enhanced cell proliferation when working concentrations were up to 20 mum [7]. therefore, we decided
to treat both cell lines with various concentrations of testosterone, an aromatase substrate. we found that administration of testosterone did not affect the proliferation of
cells. however, treatment with testosterone at higher
doses was associated with a decrease in cell proliferation.

dose response of a) exemestane and b) testosterone in  xxxd1322xxx  and a549 cells. different doses of exemestane or testosterone were applied on  xxxd1322xxx  and a549 cells and 48 h later, the number of cells was estimated with the colorimetric mtt
assay. results are expressed as mean Â± sem of the number of cells from at least three independent experiments performed in
triplicates. asterisks denote a statistically significant difference (unpaired t-test) compared to untreated cells. **p < 0.01 and
***p < 0.001.

in view of the fact that testosterone is converted to estradiol by aromatase, the latter finding seems conflicting.
however, previous reports have indicated that estrogens
may reduce cell proliferation. recent data suggest that
estrogens are capable of inducing apoptosis in certain cell
types, including breast cancer cells, immune system cells
and bone-derived cells [28,29].
although exemestane showed a trend to inhibit aromatase activity 15 min after its application in both cell
cultures, this inhibitory effect was reversed 6 h later. previous reports with  xxxd147xxx , an ai, also showed
an increase in aromatase activity in breast cancer cell line
sk-br-3, choriocarcinoma cell line jar, and in hepatocellular carcinoma hepg2 [30]. at least three mechanisms
have been suggested. the first is that ais can stabilize aromatase protein by forming enzyme-inhibitor complexes
that slow down the degradation of the enzyme [31].
indeed, we found an increase of aromatase protein levels
in  xxxd1322xxx  cells. another mechanism is that ais can modulate
aromatase expression at the transcription level [30]. in
our study, we observed an increase of aromatase mrna
levels in  xxxd1322xxx  cells. on the other hand, we didn't find the
same changes in protein and mrna levels in a549 cells.
the third possible mechanism includes changes in aromatase activity through a camp-dependent mechanism,
without affecting mrna or protein expression of the

enzyme [30]. indeed, in our study we demonstrated that
treatment of cells with exemestane increased the levels of
camp in both cell lines, 15 min after the application of the
agent. these findings suggest that exemestane may
increase the activity of aromatase through a campdependent mechanism.
although the decrease in aromatase activity was assessed
15 min following exemestane application, and this effect
was reversed 6 h after the administration of the drug,
changes in cell proliferation and aromatase protein and
mrna levels were measured 48 h after the addition of
exemestane. based on the information that the half life of
aromatase protein is 28.2 h [32], we believe that the
results from the inhibitory effect of exemestane could be
observed 48 h after drug application.
in a recently reported study [24] that assessed the prognostic role of aromatase expression in nsclc patients,
lower levels of the enzyme predicted a higher probability
of survival in women aged 65 years or older. these findings suggest that older female patients with nsclc and
high levels of aromatase might represent a group of
patients where treatment with an ai could be beneficial.
in our study, we showed that the cell line a549, which
expresses higher aromatase protein and mrna levels
might be a better target for exemestane, since aromatase

expression was not increased by this agent, in contrast to
the cell line  xxxd1322xxx  with lower aromatase levels. moreover,
fifty percent growth inhibition was recorded at 50 mum for
 xxxd1322xxx  and 20 mum for a549 cells.
finally, we found that the administration of exemestane
in  xxxd1322xxx  cells was associated with egfr activation, 15 min
after drug application. current evidence suggests that
cross-talk between steroid receptors and growth factor
receptors exists in a bidirectional way. in addition, significant interactions between estrogen signaling and egfr
have been recognized not only in breast, but also in
nsclc [5]. exemestane may affect egfr pathway independently of aromatase inhibition. it has been demonstrated that exemestane can activate er [33] which in turn
leads to the production of the egfr ligand  xxxg185xxx ,
resulting in egfr activation [34]. this mechanism may be
implicated in exemestane resistance and may also be
involved in exemestane-induced egfr activation found
in our study. other interactions between growth factor
signaling pathways and aromatase in nsclc have also
been reported [35]. the effect of exemestane on egfr
activation observed in our study also suggests that this
agent may be less effective in  xxxd1322xxx  cells, compared to a549
cells. in addition, the combination of exemestane with an
anti-egfr agent may represent a more efficient option in
 xxxd1322xxx  cells. recently, we investigated the dual inhibition of

aromatase and egfr in nsclc cell lines using exemestane and the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2029xxx . in
agreement with the aforementioned results, the combination of exemestane and  xxxd2029xxx  was more effective than
each agent alone, in  xxxd1322xxx  cells [36].
the activation of egfr followed by its translocation may
lead to receptor internalization and proteolytic degradation [37]. alternatively, egfr has been detected in caveolae, golgi complex, endoplasmatic reticulum, lysosomelike structures, nuclear envelope, nucleus and mitochondria [38,39]. in addition, it has been demonstrated that
egfr mitochondrial localization is implicated in cell survival [39]. in agreement with this observation, unpublished data from our laboratory confirmed the
translocation of egfr to mitochondria in  xxxd1322xxx  cells, following treatment with exemestane. moreover, this translocation was inhibited by the concurrent administration
of  xxxd2029xxx .
in summary, our results suggest that exemestane might
elevate estradiol levels in both cell lines through a campdependent mechanism. in addition, exemestane enhances
estradiol levels in  xxxd1322xxx  cells through an increase in mrna
and protein levels of aromatase. however, the antiproliferative effect of exemestane through induction of apoptosis remains to be elucidated. a recent report demonstrated

that high concentrations of estradiol, under low growth
stimulated conditions, decrease cell proliferation and
increase apoptosis in breast cancer cells through the sustained activation of jnk pathway [40]. indeed, our experiments were performed under low growth stimulated
conditions which mimic the low estrogenic milieu in
postmenopausal women [40]. this mechanism may represent a possible explanation for the antiproliferative
effect of exemestane in both nsclc cell lines, found in
our study.

conclusion
in conclusion, our study provides evidence that aromatase
is expressed by nsclc cells and exemestane inhibits cell
proliferation. moreover, levels of aromatase expression
might have a predictive ability in the activity of this agent,
since exemestane may activate egfr pathway in cells with
low levels of aromatase. further studies are needed to
investigate the effectiveness of exemestane in nsclc and
evaluate the potential for incorporating ais in the management of lung cancer patients.

methods
cell culture and reagents
nsclc cell lines  xxxd1322xxx  and a549, and control breast cancer
cell line mcf-7 were purchased from american type culture collection (atcc).  xxxd1322xxx  and a549 cells were cultured
in rpmi 1640 medium with 2 mm l-glutamine and supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/l glucose,
1.5 g/l sodium bicarbonate and 10% fetal bovine serum.
mcf-7 cells were cultured in eagle's minimum essential

with phosphate buffer saline (pbs) and incubated with
phenol red-free medium with 1% dextran-coated, charcoal-treated fbs (working medium) for 24 h to deplete
estrogen [7]. all the experiments were performed according to these conditions. thereafter, cells were treated with
exemestane or testosterone at the indicated time points
and doses.
immunoblotting
cells were plated at petri dishes. after reaching 80% confluence, cells were treated with working medium as
described above. forty eight hours after exemestane addition, cells were collected with scrapper and lysed using
appropriate lysis buffer (50 mm tris-hcl ph 7.5, 150 mm
nacl, 5 mm edta, 1% triton, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethyl-sulphonyl-fluoride, 2 mm na-orthovanadate
and 10 mm leupeptin). protein concentration was determined by bradford assay. samples were analyzed by
immunoblotting as described previously [7]. actin was
used as control. a goat polyclonal anti-aromatase antibody ( xxxg574xxx ) c16 (dilution 1:5000, santa cruz, ca,

(dilution 1:1000, chemicon, millipore, temecula, ca,
usa). for the detection of phosphorylated egfr/egfr,
an immunoprecipitation was performed prior to immunoblotting. briefly, cells were prepared as described
above. fifteen minutes after the addition of exemestane,
cells were collected with scrapper and lysed with sonication (3 cycles for 5 sec each, mse pg 616) using the same

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/8/1/109

lysis buffer as above. protein concentration was determined and 1 mg total protein was immunoprecipitated
with a monoclonal anti- egfr antibody (dilution 1 mug per
0.5 mg of total protein, 3h2094, santacruz, ca, usa),
overnight at 4Â°c under continuous agitation. in each
sample, 50 mul of protein-a sepharose beads (calbiochem,
merck, dermstadt, germany) were added and samples
were incubated for 4 h, at 4Â°c under continuous agitation. precipitates were washed twice with ice-cold lysis
buffer and sepharose beads were resuspended in 50 mul 2Ã
sample buffer (0.5 m tris-hcl ph 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2%
sds and 2% bromophenol blue, 10%  xxxd26xxx ). samples were heated for 5 min at 95Â°c and analyzed by immunoblotting. a monoclonal anti-tyrosine
antibody (dilution 2 mug/ml, upstate, lake placid, ny,
usa) and a monoclonal anti-egfr antibody (dilution
1:200, 3h2094, santacruz, ca, usa) were used. detection of immunoreactive proteins was performed by
chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase substrate supersignal (pierce, rockford, iil, usa), according
to manufacturer's instructions.
rna isolation and cdna synthesis
total rna was extracted from cells using absolutely rna
rt-pcr kit (stratagene, la jolla, usa) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. integrity of rna was confirmed by visualization of ribosomal bands by etbrstained agarose gel electrophoresis. rna was quantified
using ribogreen (molecular probes, leiden, the netherlands) and the mx3000p (stratagene, la jolla, usa)
according to manufacturer's instructions. first strand
cdna was synthesized as previously described [41].
real time pcr
quantification of  xxxg574xxx  mrna was performed using
gene-specific primers (f: 5'-aacaactcgacccttctttatg-3', r: 5'-tttgagggattcagcacag-3') and sybr
green i intercalation dye in brilliant sybr green qpcr
master mix (stratagene, la jolla, usa). expressed alu-sq
repeat levels were also similarly quantified using primers
designed by dr j. vandesompele, gent university hospital, belgium. in addition, a standard curve was included in
each run for assay validation. reactions were performed as
previously described [41].  xxxg574xxx  mrna levels were normalised to alu-sq levels which were found to be unaffected by exemestane treatment.
cell proliferation assay
to determine whether exemestane or testosterone affect
the proliferation of  xxxd1322xxx  and a549 nsclc cell lines, the
3[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-dimethyltetrazolium
bromide (mtt) assay was used, as previously described
[42]. briefly, cells were plated at a density of 2 Ã 104 cells
per well in 24-well tissue culture plates. the medium was
aspirated later at 24 h, cells were washed twice with phos-

phate buffer saline (pbs) and 0.5 ml of working medium
was added in each well. after a 24 h incubation exemestane or testosterone was added into cells. cell proliferation was measured 48 h after exemestane addition using
mtt assay. mtt stock (5 mg/ml in pbs) at a volume equal
to 1/10 of the medium was added and plates were incubated at 37Â°c for 2 h. the medium was removed, the cells
were washed with pbs ph 7.4 and 100 mul acidified isopropanol (0.33 ml hcl in 100 ml isopropanol) was added to
each well and agitated thoroughly in order to solubilise
the dark blue formazan crystals. the solution was transferred to 96-well plates and immediately read on a micro-

plate reader (tecan, sunrise, magellan 2) at a wavelength
of 570 nm. results were always confirmed by direct measurements of the cells using a standard neubauer haemocytometer.
apoptosis assay
both nsclc cell lines were plated at 1 Ã 105 cells per well
in 6-well plates. exemestane was added as previously
described. at the end of a 48 h incubation, cells were
washed twice with pbs, trypsinized for 6 min and centrifuged for 4 min at 166 g. cells were resuspended in 200 mul

2.5 mm cacl2). the cell suspension was incubated with 5
mul  xxxg166xxx -fitc in the dark at 25Â°c, for 10 min. then,
10 mul of the 20 mug/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide stock solution
was added, followed by 400 mul of binding buffer and cells
were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry [43]
(epics-xl of coulter) according to manufacturer's
instructions (rh  xxxg166xxx /fitc kit, bender medsystems).
aromatase activity
aromatase activity was estimated through measurement
of estradiol production by elisa (ibl hamburg, germany) according to manufacturer's instructions at 450
nm with a microplate reader (tecan, sunrise, magellan 2).
briefly, cells were plated at 2 Ã 104 cells per well in 24-well
plates. exemestane or testosterone was added as previously described. at several time points after incubation
(0.25, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h), supernatants were collected
and stored at -20Â°c until the end of the experiment.
twenty five mul of each sample was added into well that
was pre-coated with a polyclonal antibody against estradiol molecule. then 200 mul of appropriate enzyme conjugate was added to each well and an incubation of 2 h was
followed. after the incubation, wells were washed 3 times
with wash solution and 100 mul of suitable substrate solution was added to each well. fifteen minutes later, the
enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 50 mul of stop
solution. the absorbance of each well was measured at
450 nm with a microplate reader within 10 min after add-

ing the stop solution. an appropriate standard curve was
determined.
camp detection
the camp levels were measured using an elisa kit assay
(r&d systems europe, ltd, uk). samples were prepared
according to manufacturer's instructions. briefly,  xxxd1322xxx  and
a549 cells were plated in petri dishes. after reaching 50%
confluence, cells were treated with working medium as
described above and 24 h later exemestane was added into
cells. supernatants were removed 15 and 30 min later and
cells were washed 3 times with cold pbs. then, cells were
resuspended in cell lysis buffer 5 (1Ã) that was included in
kit to a concentration of 1 Ã 107 cells/ml. cells were
freezed at â¤ -20Â°c and thawed with gentle mixing. the
cycle of freeze/thaw was repeated once. samples were centrifuged at 600 Ã g for 10 min at 4Â°c to remove cellular
debris. samples were stored at -20Â°c until their use. suitable microplate containg pre-coated wells with goat antimouse antibody, was incubated with 50 mul of a monoclonal antibody specific for camp for 1 h at room temperature. after the incubation, wells were washed 3 times
with wash solution and 100 mul of each sample was added
to each well. then, 50 mul of camp congjugate was added
to all wells and an incubation of 2 h was followed. after a
step of 3 washes, 200 mul of a substrate solution was added
to each well and an incubation of 30 min in dark was followed. then, 100 mul of stop solution was added to each

well. the absorbance of each well was measured at 450
nm with correction at 570 nm in a microplate reader
(tecan, sunrise, magellan 2) within 30 min after adding
the stop solution. an appropriate standard curve was
determined.
immunofluorescense
both nsclc cell lines were treated with exemestane as
previously described. twenty four hours later, medium
was removed and cells were washed twice with pbs. cells
were fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs buffered
solution for 10 min at room temperature and then they
were rinsed 3 Ã 5 min with pbs. an incubation of 1 h was
followed by a 3% bsa solution supplemented with 10%
fbs at 37Â°c. after the incubation with blocking solution,
cells were rinsed once with pbs for 5 min and they were
treated overnight at 4Â°c with a monoclonal anti-egfr
antibody diluted in blocking solution (10 mug/ml, upstate,
lake placid, ny, usa,). cells were rinsed 3 Ã 5 min with
pbs and then an anti-mouse antibody conjugated with
alexa fluor 594 (1:500, invitrogen, molecular probe)
diluted in blocking solution was added for 30 min at
37Â°c. cells were rinsed 3 Ã 5 min with pbs and mounted
on glass sides. fluorescence was visualized using a leica
microscope.
egfr phosphorylation
the levels of phosphorylated egfr were determined
using an elisa kit system (bender medsystems gmbh,
austria), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
briefly, cells were seeded in 100 mm petri dishes at a density of 106 cells per dish and were treated as previously
described. fifteen minutes after the addition of exemestane, supernatants were removed and cells were collected
with scraper. lysis of cells was followed by adding receptor binding buffer. samples were transferred onto 96microwell plate coated with a monoclonal antibody to
human active egfr and incubated for 1 h at 37Â°c. microwells were emptied and washed three times with washing
buffer. an anti- xxxd1075xxx  monoclonal antibody
(horseradish peroxidase conjugated) was added and samples were incubated for 1 h at 37Â°c. microwells were
washed four times and a suitable substrate solution was
added to each sample for 15 min. the reaction was
stopped by adding a stop solution and the samples were
immediately measured on a microplate reader (tecan,
sunrise, magellan 2) at a wavelength of 450 nm. the
results were normalized by measuring the amount of total
proteins using bradford assay, since total protein amount
is not altered for the time point of 15 min after exemestane addition.
statistical analysis
differences between groups and controls were tested by
unpaired t-test. each experiment included at least tripli-
