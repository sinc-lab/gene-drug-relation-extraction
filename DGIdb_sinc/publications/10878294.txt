abstract
 xxxd2450xxx  žaravae. has recently been approved by the food and drug administration for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis žra.. the drug, due to its protective effects on structural joint damage, has been classified as a disease modifying
anti-rheumatic drug ždmard..  xxxd2450xxx  is structurally dissimilar from other drugs currently used to treat ra and
exhibits a different mechanism of action. it has shown to be protective in a variety of animal models of arthritis and
autoimmunity based on its immunomodulatory activity.  xxxd2450xxx  is rapidly converted in vivo to its pharmacologically
active metabolite a77 1726. this metabolite is a potent non-cytotoxic inhibitor of the enzyme  xxxg633xxx 
ždhodh., a key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of  xxxd870xxx  žump.. activated lymphocytes depend on the
pyrimidine de novo syntheses to fulfill their metabolic needs for clonal expansion and terminal differentiation into effector
cells. de novo synthesis of pyrimidines is not only essential to provide precursors for new rna and dna synthesis, but also
for phospholipid synthesis and the pyrimidine sugars necessary for protein glycosylation, which support the massive
expansion in membrane biosynthesis to form daughter cells. this mechanism likely contributes to  xxxd2450xxx ’s action as a
dmard in ra and other autoimmune diseases. this review is a summary of current in vivo and in vitro data, focussing
primarily on the mechanism of action of  xxxd2450xxx  in ra. q 2000 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

inflammation of synovial tissues and infiltration of
the affected joints by blood-derived cells. this includes memory t cells, dendritic cells, macrophages
and plasma cells, all of which show signs of activation. in most cases, this leads to progressive erosion
of adjacent cartilage and underlying bone. joint destruction is believed to be mediated mainly by cytokine-induced destructive enzymes, particularly
members of the matrix metalloproteinase family. the
consequences of this progressive disease are
chronicracute morbidity, reduced ability to perform
activities of daily living, permanent disability and

increased mortality žjanossy et al., 1981; cush and
lipsky, 1988; muller-ladner, 1996; dudler and so,
1998..
the underlying cause of ra is not known and
there is currently no consensus as to which principal
regulatory cell represents an optimal therapeutic target. however, in light of the postulated autoimmune
basis for ra, a number of reports have implicated a
role for t lymphocytes in either the initiation or the
persistence of the disease žgoronzy and weyand,
1995; panayi, 1997; moots, 1998.. recent observations in animal models support the key role of t
cells in ra. depletion of synovial t cells from scid
mice that have been transplanted with inflamed synovial tissue led to an immediate reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, monokines and tissue destructive metalloproteinases žklimiuk et al., 1999.. other
studies have shown that perturbations in t cell
homeostasis and clonal outgrowth of cd4q cells can
lead to chronic, persistent synovitis in ra patients
žrittner et al., 1997; striebich et al., 1998; wagner et
al., 1998.. anti-t cell directed therapies have
demonstrated to be partially efficacious žmatteson,
1997. and the resolution of pre-existing ra in patients developing aids also indicated an involvement of t cells žcalabrese et al., 1989.. most recently, b lymphocytes, in their role as secretors of
arthrogenic immunoglobulins in t cell-initiated autoimmunity, have been shown to play a more important role in the pathogenesis of ra than had been
previously suspected žkorganow et al., 1999.. despite the large number of activated lymphocytes in
the synovial lesions,  xxxg1173xxx  production has been
difficult to demonstrate. conversely, macrophage-derived cytokines, such as il-1b and  xxxg2296xxx  , are readily detectable, indicating a possible role for
macrophages in the pathogenesis of ra žburmester
et al., 1997.. however, the activation of synovial
macrophages may not require soluble mediators,
since direct cell–cell contact between activated t
cells and macrophages or fibroblasts is sufficient for
activation and itself may be important in the progression of rheumatoid synovitis žlacraz et al., 1994;
chizzolini et al., 1997. it is therefore not clear
whether macrophages or synovial fibroblasts themselves orchestrate this pathway, or whether they are
merely acting as lymphocyte-directed mediators in
ra.

 xxxd2450xxx  žaravae. is a novel immunoregulatory and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug,
structurally unrelated to other immunosuppressive
agents. it is an isoxazole derivative and originated
from an anti-arthritis drug development program at
hoechst žheubach, 1977..  xxxd2450xxx , a non-cytotoxic inhibitor of the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated t- and b-lymphocytes in vitro, is effective in
several rodent autoimmune disease models and prolongs tissue graft survival in animals žgraul and
castaner, 1998.. more recently,  xxxd2450xxx  has
shown clinical efficacy in multiple phase iii studies
in europe and the us ždunn and small, 1999;
smolen et al., 1999; strand et al., 1999..
this article will review recent work on both the
pharmacological effects as well as the mechanism of
action of  xxxd2450xxx , with the intention of providing
a basis for understanding  xxxd2450xxx ’s immunomodulatory activity, toxicity, drug interactions
and the rationale for its use in single- and combination disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug
ždmard. therapy. several mechanisms of action
for  xxxd2450xxx  that have been proposed will be
discussed in this review. the main focus, however,
will be on the inhibition of  xxxg633xxx  ždhodh., a key enzyme in the de novo
synthesis of ump. this biochemical reaction is a
critical step in the progression of the cell cycle from
g1 to s phase in activated lymphocytes. potential
models for molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying  xxxd2450xxx -induced immunomodulatory effects, which explain the selective nature of the drug
to affect primarily activated, autoimmune lymphocytes, will be discussed.

2. chemistry, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2450xxx 
 xxxd2450xxx  w n-ž4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl.-5methylisoxazol-4-carboxamidex žfig. 1. is an isoxazole derivative with a molecular weight of 270.2
žc 12 h 9 f3 n2 o 2 .. it is structurally and functionally
unrelated to other known immunomodulatory drugs
žbartlett, 1986; brazelton and morris, 1996..
after oral administration,  xxxd2450xxx  is nearly
100% metabolized and converted to its active openring metabolite, a  xxxd3316xxx  termed a77

1726 w3-cyano-3-hydroxy-n-ž4-trifluoromethylphenyl.-crotonamidex žfig. 1.. a77 1726 is the water-soluble compound normally used in vitro studies.
this non-enzymatic conversion of  xxxd2450xxx  into
a77 1726 occurs primarily in the intestinal mucosa
and plasma. in addition, it appears that conversion
by the liver during ‘‘first pass’’ metabolism may
also play a role žlucien et al., 1995; mladenovic et
al., 1995..  xxxd2450xxx  is rapidly cleared from the

275

blood stream žlucien et al., 1995.. a phase ii clinical trial has revealed linear pharmacokinetics of a77
1726 over the dosage range of 5–25 mg  xxxd2450xxx 
per day, with a mean plasma half-live of 15–18 days
and a bioavailability of nearly 100% žmladenovic et
al., 1995.. the pharmacologically active metabolite
a77 1726 was found to be extensively ž) 99.3%.

and renal excretion žmladenovic et al., 1995.. structure–activity relationship studies have attempted to
identify  xxxd2450xxx  analogs with equivalent activity
but contrasting pharmacokinetic properties žkuo et
al., 1996.. during these studies, a high-affinity binding site for a77 1726 in mouse spleen membrane
preparations was identified which exhibits sequence
homology with both human ž81%. and rat ž91%.

metabolite of  xxxd2450xxx  a77 1726 žtable 1.. although these studies provide evidence that  xxxg633xxx

possibility that this class of compounds may have
additional binding sites and effects in vivo or in

3. clinical trials
phase iii double blind studies in europe and in
the us have shown that  xxxd2450xxx  ž20 mgrday.
provides statistically significant clinical benefit in
comparison to placebo. the clinical benefits of
 xxxd2450xxx  were comparable to methotrexate ž7.5 to
15 mgrweek. in the us trial žstrand et al., 1999.
and to  xxxd3255xxx  in the european trial žsmolen et
al., 1999., leading to approval of  xxxd2450xxx 
žaravae. by the us fda and a recommendation to
the european commission by the european authorities. additionally, a pilot study of ra patients refractory to methotrexate therapy showed significant benefit from the combination of  xxxd2450xxx  and
methotrexate žweinblatt et al., 1999.. a double blind
phase iv trial utilizing this combination is underway
to further explore these encouraging results. interestingly, in addition to the noted absence of significant
hematopoietic, renal, or mucosal toxicity in these
studies, no opportunistic infections were observed.
further, the incidence of lymphoproliferative disorders in patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx  was not significantly increased in comparison to ra patients
receiving methotrexate or  xxxd3255xxx . the most
frequently seen adverse events after  xxxd2450xxx 
therapy are gastrointestinal, including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, dose-dependent rash, reversible
alopecia and transiently elevated liver functions have
also been reported. besides its efficacy against ra,
 xxxd2450xxx  has also been shown to be effective in a
phase iia clinical trial for wegener’s granulomatosis
žmetzler et al., 1998. and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of systemic
lupus erythematosus žsle. and uveitis.
4.  xxxd2450xxx  and experimental autoimmune
diseases in animals
 xxxd2450xxx  has been reported to be effective in
several autoimmune animal models. the drug has

been shown to be active in auto-antibody driven
autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis
žvidic-dankovic et al., 1995., experimental allergic
encephalomyelitis žbartlett et al., 1993. or autoantibody-mediated damage to the outer and inner areas
of the kidneys in rats žglomeronephritis and tubulonephritis, respectively. žogawa et al., 1990..
 xxxd2450xxx  was also shown to be effective in rats
with experimental autoimmune uveitis where it inhibited ocular inflammation and local autoantibody
formation žrobertson and lang, 1994; smith-lang et
al., 1999.. furthermore,  xxxd2450xxx  has shown beneficial effects in numerous animal models, including
lymphoproliferation, sle mrlrlpr žpopovic and
bartlett, 1986., graft versus host disease žpopovic
and bartlett, 1987., proteoglycan-induced arthritis
žglant et al., 1992., a diabetic nod mouse model
žstosic-grujicic et al., 1999., rat adjuvant arthritis
žbartlett and schleyerbach, 1985. and allergic asthma
žeber et al., 1998.. besides its efficacy against ra
žsmolen et al., 1999; strand et al., 1999. and systemic vasculitis žgross, 1999., these studies in animal models of autoimmune disease suggest that idiopathic autoimmune human diseases such as sle,
diabetes, renal and neurologic disorders may also
benefit from treatment with  xxxd2450xxx .

5.  xxxd2450xxx  modulates b cell-mediated immunity
in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that  xxxd2450xxx  inhibits the formation of specific antibodies. in
several of these studies, b cells were more sensitive
to  xxxd2450xxx  action than other cell types tested
žlin and waer, 1996; lucien et al., 1996; siemasko
et al., 1996.. additionally,  xxxd2450xxx  has been
shown to reduce the levels of auto-antibodies in
animal models of autoimmune disease žbartlett et al.,
1988; glant et al., 1992; vidic-dankovic et al.,
1995., allergy žeber et al., 1998; jarman et al., 1999.
and both allo- and xenoantibodies in organ transplantation where it has been used in combination with
other immunosuppressive agents žwilliams et al.,
1994; lin et al., 1998b; antoniou et al., 1999..
when compared to placebo,  xxxd2450xxx  also signifi-

m.l. herrmann et al.r immunopharmacology 47 (2000) 273–289

cantly inhibited the formation of rheumatoid factors
in ra patients žsmolen et al., 1999.. the stimuli
leading to the secretion of rheumatoid factors in ra
patients remain unclear but there is compelling evidence that such antibody production is t cell-dependent žgoronzy and weyand, 1995.. most recently it
has been shown that b-lymphocytes play a more
important role in the pathogenesis of ra than initially suspected. in a t cell receptor transgenic mouse
model that spontaneously develops a ra-like condition similar to that in humans žkouskoff et al.,
1996., disease development is initiated by systemic
t cell self-reactivity, but appears to need b cells as
secretors of arthrogenic immunoglobulins žkorganow
et al., 1999..
the exact mechanism by which  xxxd2450xxx  interferes with b cell functions and inhibits humoral
immune responses is not fully understood. potential
mechanisms include the inhibition of b cell proliferation, differentiation, or antibody secretion. it has
been shown that  xxxd2450xxx  inhibits both t cell-dependent and -independent proliferation as well as the
formation of antibodies from b-lymphocytes
žsiemasko et al., 1996; lin et al., 1997. which may
be of importance for the successful treatment of ra.
the literature provides two potential molecular
mechanisms to explain  xxxd2450xxx ’s effects on b
cells: ž1. the depletion of pyrimidine pools by the
inhibition of  xxxg633xxx , and ž2. the inhibition of
 xxxg2198xxx  activity ždiscussed below.. the latter
mechanism is proposed to be responsible for the
inhibition of b cell differentiation and subsequent
isotype switching from igm to igg or ige žsiemasko
et al., 1998.. the fact that  xxxd2450xxx  directly and
indirectly inhibits b cell function, both in vivo and in
vitro, suggests that this class of compounds may be
highly effective in controlling humoral immune responses. since  xxxd2450xxx  inhibits antibody formation, not only through t cell-mediated action but also
by directly suppressing b cell functions, it may be a
promising candidate for combination therapy in organ transplantation. this may prove especially effective for long term graft survival, since  xxxd2450xxx 
has already shown synergistic effects with  xxxd1781xxx , a drug which primarily affects t cells
žlin et al., 1994; lirtzman et al., 1996..  xxxd2450xxx 
may therefore become a valuable tool for the treatment of other antibody-mediated diseases.

277

6.  xxxd2450xxx  modulates t cell-mediated immunity
t lymphocytes are the dominant cell population
that infiltrates the synovial membrane in ra. one
potential explanation for the therapeutic effects of
 xxxd2450xxx  is the reduction in the numbers or reactivity of t cells involved in the pathogenesis of
chronic inflammatory diseases. this hypothesis is
supported by data from  xxxd2450xxx  studies on the t
cell-driven immune responses in animal models of
autoimmunity, including collagen type ii and other
models of arthritis žbartlett et al., 1996., as well as
eae žbartlett et al., 1993. and diabetes žstosic-grujicic et al., 1999.. however, there is little direct in
vivo evidence as yet which can support the hypothesis that  xxxd2450xxx  diminishes the number or activity of t lymphocytes in inflammation žsilva et al.,
1997.. furthermore, available in vivo data showing a
decrease in activated t-helper cells žbartlett et al.,
1996. or ex vivo t cell activity in peripheral blood
lymphocytes from  xxxd2450xxx -treated patients žsilva
et al., 1996a. must be interpreted with caution. therapeutic strategies against ra that focus on depletion
of cd4qt cells in peripheral blood had no influence
on the number of t cells at the site of inflammation
žthe synovial tissue., and, consequently, do not cause
significant disease remission žjendro et al., 1995;
ruderman et al., 1995; matteson, 1997.. thus, a
thorough analysis of the total pool of peripheral t
lymphocytes would probably not provide insight into
the beneficial role of  xxxd2450xxx  in t cell-mediated
disease, as a few cells of an autoimmune infiltrate
are apparently capable of controlling a large population of proinflammatory cells žsteinman, 1996..
another potential model of how  xxxd2450xxx 
treatment may modulate the immune response comes
from tolerance induction experiments žschorlemmer
et al., 1993; bartlett et al., 1996..  xxxd2450xxx , but
not  xxxd1781xxx , was able to induce self-tolerance
in rats and mrlrlpr mice and tolerance was transferable through splenocytes. the cellular mechanism
behind this interesting effect is still unknown but it is
tempting to speculate that  xxxd2450xxx  treatment may
lead to an increase in ‘‘anergic’’ t cells which
function as suppressor t cells. evidence for t cellmediated suppression can be derived from adoptive
transfer models in transplantation and suggest that

278

m.l. herrmann et al.r immunopharmacology 47 (2000) 273–289

cd4q and cd8q t cells mediate these regulatory
effects in different systems. one model proposes that
antigen-specific t cells, when rendered nonresponsive, suppress other t cells that have identical specificity by competing for antigen and stimulatory cytokines žkilshaw et al., 1975; qin et al., 1993;
lombardi et al., 1994.. since  xxxd2450xxx -treated t
cells are able to express surface markers and cytokines necessary for t helper functions žlang et al.,
1995; deage et al., 1998; richard and hoskin, 1998.,
but fail to clonally expand žcherwinski et al., 1995b.
and even produce tgf-b žcao et al., 1996., it seems
possible that these static, ‘‘anergized’’ t lymphocytes can act as suppressor cells in vivo.
the vast majority of data on the impact of
 xxxd2450xxx  on t cells has come from in vitro
studies. the primary effect of the active metabolite
a77 1726 seems to be the inhibition of proliferation
but it also affects various t cell functions žcao et al.,
1995; bartlett et al., 1996.. the dose-dependent
anti-proliferative effect of a77 1726 has been shown
in primary t cells and several t-lymphoblastoid cell
lines žcherwinski et al., 1995a; xu et al., 1995.. the
effect differs among species, with rat lymphocytes
being the most sensitive, followed respectively by
mouse and human lymphocytes žtable 1.. these
differences must be considered when comparing drug
efficacy and overall implications of disease models,
both in vitro and in whole animals.
evidence for a preferential effect of  xxxd2450xxx 
on t and b lymphocytes in vivo comes from transplantation experiments in t cell-deficient nude rats
žlin et al., 1997, 1998b.. these elegant transplantation experiments provide the only in vivo evidence
that  xxxd2450xxx  predominantly affects lymphocytes
and spares terminally differentiated cells žmacrophages and natural killer cells., thus leaving the
innate immune system unaffected.  xxxd2450xxx  was
unable to prevent xenograft rejection in nude rats. in
these animals the xenograft rejection was driven by
nk cells and macrophages. these findings may also
partially explain the clinical observation that ra
patients treated with  xxxd2450xxx  do not develop
opportunistic infections. since  xxxd2450xxx  does not
suppress macrophage and nk cell functions, it will
not impair their ability to mount responses against
viral infections žvia nk cells. and endotoxemia žvia
macrophages.. besides valuable information in deci-

phering potential target cells for  xxxd2450xxx , these
experiments indirectly emphasize the importance of
t- and b-cell driven responses in ra, where the
drug has already been shown to be efficacious
žsmolen et al., 1999; strand et al., 1999..
the lack of opportunistic infections could also be
due to a potential anti-viral effect caused by  xxxd2450xxx  itself žwaldman et al., 1999., since inhibitors
of pyrimidine de novo synthesis have been shown to
reduce virus replication žkatsafanas et al., 1997. and
de novo nucleotide biosynthesis is a known target for
antiprotozoal žgero and o’sullivan, 1990. or antibacterial therapy žmendz et al., 1994..
in addition to its antiproliferative activity, a77
1726 exhibits minimal direct effects on cytokine
production and cytokine receptor expression at ic 50
concentrations ži.e. concentrations that affect proliferation. žbartlett et al., 1996.. published data on this
subject are controversial and appear to be governed
by factors such as experimental cell system, type of
stimulus, drug concentration and incubation periods.
for example, it has been reported that the expression
of il-2,  xxxg1175xxx  and cd134 is inhibited by a77 1726
in human t cells žxu et al., 1995; slauson et al.,
1999.. other effects on cytokine synthesis have been
reported, including augmentation of the immunosuppressive cytokine  xxxg2269xxx  and suppression of the
immunostimulatory cytokine il-2 žcao et al., 1996..
in contrast, it is reported elsewhere that a77 1726 is
not capable of inhibiting the production of il-2 and
il-4, nor the expression of the  xxxg1175xxx  žzielinski et
al., 1994; lang et al., 1995; richard and hoskin,
1998.. these results have been confirmed by other
groups who report that a77 1726 does not directly
interfere with other signaling events following t cell
activation, including ca2q mobilization, transcription factor že.g. nfat, nfk b, ap-1. activation, and
subsequent stimulation of the il-2 promoter žcao et
al., 1995; herrmann et al., 1998.. interestingly, recent data demonstrate the potential of a77 1726 but
not dexamethasone to alter the expression of cell
surface activating factors on stimulated t lymphocytes, thus preventing the optimal activation of
monocytes through direct cell–cell contact ždeage et
al., 1998.. the authors propose that this mechanism
may relate to the beneficial effect of  xxxd2450xxx  in
ra, since the drug enhances the molar ratio of
il-1raril-1b and timp-1rmmp-1, thus shifting

m.l. herrmann et al.r immunopharmacology 47 (2000) 273–289

the balance in favor of anti-inflammatory mediators
and slowing matrix destruction. previous studies have
postulated that  xxxd2450xxx  may mediate cell–cell
contact and cell adhesion ždimitrijevic and bartlett,
1996; lin et al., 1998a., maybe through a mechanism involving protein glycosylation events ždiscussed later.. more recently, opposing effects of high
and low dose a77 1726 treatment of cytotoxic t
lymphocytes in vitro have been demonstrated. at
concentrations approximating 10 mm, a77 1726 effectively inhibits cytotoxic t cell generation and
function, but at lower concentrations ž0.5 mm. it
appears to enhance cytotoxic t cell development
žhoskin et al., 1998..  xxxd2450xxx  may also interfere with stress signal-induced activation of nfk b
žmanna and aggarwal, 1999.. in the human jurkat t
cell line, a77 1726 inhibits the activation of nfk b
by various stress-induced stimuli, including tumor
necrosis factor žtnf., phorbol  xxxd2681xxx  acetate
žpma., lps, h 2 o 2 , okadaic acid and ceramide.
this inhibition occurs in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. a77 1726 also blocks tnf-dependent
degradation of ik ba , the subsequent nuclear
translocation of nfk b, and nfk b-dependent reporter gene expression. these effects appear to occur
through suppression of p56 lck and the mitogenactivated kinase pathways. since the inhibition is not
restricted to tnf, a77 1726 must influence activation of these cascades at a level common to all of the
activators mentioned above. although p56 lck is a
 xxxg2198xxx  primarily found in hematopoetic cells,
these effects were also shown in myeloid, epithelial
and glioma cells. further, the described signaling
effects could only be shown after a minimal preincubation time of 2 h žmanna and aggarwal, 1999..
these observations raise the question of whether
 xxxd2450xxx  really exerts its effects via the inhibition
of a ‘redundant’  xxxg2198xxx  for all of these
pathways, or if it mediates cytostatic activity, since
pyrimidine nucleotide pools are already maximally
depleted in this cell line after 2 h žherrmann et al.,
1998..

7. the molecular target(s) of  xxxd2450xxx 
currently, at least two in vitro modes of drug
action have been proposed for the active  xxxd2450xxx 

279

metabolite, a77 1726: inhibition of various tyrosine
kinases and reversible inhibition of  xxxg633xxx , the
fourth enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis
pathway. the immunomodulatory properties of
 xxxd2450xxx , as well as its reported therapeutic effects, have been attributed to apparently distinct, but
not mutually exclusive, biochemical mechanisms.

8. effects on various tyrosine kinases
at least five different and structurally divergent
tyrosine kinases have so far been described as targets
of a77 1726 inhibition žtable 1.. protein tyrosine
kinases andror general phosphorylation events play
an essential role in antigen receptor and growth
factor receptor signaling events. it is generally accepted that they are indispensable for signal transduction and subsequent induction of cell growth
andror differentiation žpaul and seder, 1994; hunter,
1995.. based on this understanding, inhibitors of
tyrosine kinases are proposed as therapeutic agents
for various disorders žlevitzki and gazit, 1995.. the
first kinase identified to be inhibited by a77 1726
was  xxxg682xxx   xxxg2198xxx 
žegfr-tk. žmattar et al., 1993., followed by p56 lck ,
 xxxg799xxx  fyn žxu et al., 1995, 1996. and janus kinases 1
and 3 žjak1 and  xxxg1221xxx . želder et al., 1997; siemasko
et al., 1998.. the quantified cellular end effect of the
drug in the test systems utilized were either the
inhibition of proliferation or a decrease in production
of soluble mediators, including cytokines and normally secreted antibodies. using recombinant kinases and their natural peptide substrates, we were
not able to confirm these published results žunpublished data.. the concentrations of a77 1726 required for  xxxg2198xxx  inhibition are much higher
than the ic 50 values for inhibition of proliferation of
the same cells žtable 1., with one notable exception,
but where longer preincubation times were required
to generate an effect žmanna and aggarwal, 1999..
further, given the tight structure–activity relationships within this class of compounds žkuo et al.,
1996; mahajan et al., 1999. the peculiar issue of a
single molecule ža77 1726. which specifically inhibits five very different tyrosine kinases needs to be
addressed. accumulation of a77 1726-treated cells
in the late g1 to s-phase of the cell cycle and the

ability of a77 1726 to affect cells after they have
already entered the s-phase žcherwinski et al., 1995a.
suggests that the reported tyrosine kinases, normally
required for early phases of cell cycle progression in
g0rg1 žhung et al., 1996., may not be relevant
targets. detailed kinetic analysis of  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibition by a77 1726, as well as data describing its
direct binding to these proteins, has yet to be reported. establishing the effects on these enzymes is
obviously important to fully understand  xxxg2198xxx  regulation by a77 1726. nevertheless, one can
estimate the in vivo potency of this compound utilizing its established potency on purified human
 xxxg633xxx  ž k i s 179 " 19 nm. ždavis et al., 1996.
ždiscussed below. and its reported ic 50 values from
in vitro kinase assays using the  xxxg2198xxx  receptors as egfr, src family kinases, p56 l ck and
 xxxg799xxx  f y n, as well as  xxxg1219xxx  and 3 žtable 1.. we estimate
that a77 1726 is a 150- to 900-fold more potent
inhibitor of  xxxg633xxx  than that of tyrosine kinases.
the concentrations necessary for inhibition of tyrosine kinases may not readily be reached in vivo due
to the pharmacokinetic properties of the active
metabolite žweber and harnisch, 1997.. the considerable interspecies differences in binding affinity of
a77 1726 žrat and mouse  xxxg633xxx  are far more
sensitive to drug action than is the human isoform.
complicate the use of primarily murine derived data
to support drug action models in humans žwilliamson et al., 1996; knecht and loffler, 1998. žtable 1..
however, these data do not exclude the possibility
that a77 1726 might have an impact on the signaling
ability of the treated cells. it is possible that a77
1726 treatment at the high concentrations required to
affect  xxxg2198xxx  in vitro may induce complete
stasis of the cell, thus leading to a state of unresponsiveness to external stimulation. using a77 1726treated t cells from healthy human donors, it has
been shown that at ; 100 mm or higher, the drug
induces complete stasis of metabolism in these lymphocytes, accompanied by a depletion of all nucleotide pools including atp and gtp žruckemann
et al., 1998.. this could severely compromise atpand gtp-dependent activation processes such as protein phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases žkharbanda
et al., 1990.. additionally, recent studies identified
several novel ptk inhibitors that were potent on
isolated ptks in vitro, however, they ineffective in

intact cells unless the intracellular concentration of
atp was artificially lowered žosherov et al., 1993..
thus, the perturbation of atp:gtp balance by a77
1726 may influence the quality and efficiency of
several signal transduction pathways žxu et al., 1995,
1996; elder et al., 1997; siemasko et al., 1998.. this
phenomenon may help to explain why a general
decrease in the phosphorylation pattern was observed
at high drug concentrations in several studies focussing on the effects of a77 1726 on protein
phosphorylation žxu et al., 1995, 1996, 1997.. in
summary, a concomitant damping of atprgtp-dependent reactions at high drug concentrations within
the cell is an interesting and plausible supposition for
the putative effects on  xxxg2198xxx  activities observed by some groups. however, it may still be
important to determine the activity of potential  xxxg2198xxx  targets in ra patients after treatment
with  xxxd2450xxx , as well as the general phosphorylation patterns from their peripheral and synovial lymphocytes.
9.  xxxd2450xxx  inhibits pyrimidine de novo synthesis
to date, there is convincing evidence that the
repression of de novo pyrimidine synthesis by inhibition of dihydroorotate-dehydrogenase ždhodh., the
fourth enzyme in the pathway, is the predominant
target of the mode of action of  xxxd2450xxx  žsilva
and morris, 1997; fox, 1998..
the presence of intact purine and pyrimidine
synthesis pathways is critical for normal immune
responses, as highlighted by the characterization of
genetic diseases which are accompanied by severe tand b-lymphocyte depletion and immunodeficiency
že.g. hereditary orotic aciduria, purine-nucleoside
phosphorylase deficiency and  xxxg62xxx 
deficiency. žsimmonds et al., 1978; hershfield and
mitchell, 1995; webster et al, 1995.. pyrimidine and
purine bases serve as precursor, not only for rna
and dna synthesis, but also for membrane lipid
biosynthesis, protein glycosylation, energy
metabolism, and a variety of important intracellular
messengers and enzyme cofactors žberridge and
irvine, 1989; peters et al., 1990a; vance, 1990.. this
role makes them indispensable for cellular
metabolism and growth, thus validates them as tar-

m.l. herrmann et al.r immunopharmacology 47 (2000) 273–289

gets for drug intervention žallison and eugui, 1993;
fairbanks et al., 1995.. cells can fulfill their
metabolic requirements for purines and pyrimidine
through either de novo synthesis or salvage pathways. the salvage pathways are used for the synthesis of nucleotides from pre-formed nucleosides or
nucleobases and are energetically less costly than de
novo synthesis žgriffith and jarvis, 1996.. interestingly, resting lymphocytes and thymocytes replenish
their nucleotide pools by utilizing the salvage pathways, whereas activated t- and b-lymphocytes appear to depend strongly on de novo pathways to
synthesize these essential precursors, with a significant preference for pyrimidine nucleotides žjones,
1980; marijnen et al., 1989; morford et al., 1994..
this preference implicates additional important precursor functions for pyrimidine nucleotides besides
rna and dna synthesis. for example, ctp is the
most important nucleotide for phospholipid synthesis
in mammalian cells žkent et al., 1991.. intracellular
ctp levels are an important factor in determining
the rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis and thus
are key factors when cells must double their phospholipid mass to form daughter cells žjackowski,
1996.. phospholipid pools also play an important
role in the generation of bioactive lipid messengers
že.g. diacylglycerol, phosphatidate,  xxxd2973xxx  and  xxxd208xxx . all of which play a
role in cell activation, proliferation and inflammatory
processes žberridge and irvine, 1989; exton, 1990;
terce et al., 1994.. another often-understated consequence of pyrimidine nucleotide depletion by a77
1726 is the perturbation of protein glycosylation
events through depletion of pyrimidine nucleotide
sugars žruckemann et al., 1998., which may have
considerable consequences for t and b cell functions
žpaulson, 1989; yednock and rosen, 1989.. cmpsialic acid is one such nucleotide sugar, which may
be of importance, especially in view of recent reports
of an immunosuppressed phenotype in mice lacking
st6gal sialyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for
the addition of cmp-sialic acid to form sia6lacnac
glycoconjugates. specifically, these mice display reduced serum igm levels, impaired b-cell proliferation in response to igm, cd40 crosslinking, and
attenuated antibody production to both t-independent and -dependent antigens žhennet et al., 1998..
additionally, modification of a single n-linked

281

glycosylation site can by itself have a major impact
on the function of cell surface molecules involved in
cell–cell contact and activation of lymphocytes
žsgroi et al., 1996.. to date, only a few studies have
investigated  xxxd2450xxx ’s effects on adhesion or
direct cell–cell interaction. it would be interesting to
see if  xxxd2450xxx  interferes with specific glycosylation events, subsequently influencing glycosylationdependent processes in disease development. the
reported effects of a77 1726 on down-regulation of
adhesion molecules such as p- and e-selectins žlin
et al., 1998a., homotypic adhesion of mononuclear
cells from ra patients ždimitrijevic and bartlett,
1996., and direct cell–cell contact between t cells
and macrophages ždeage et al., 1998. could owe to a
decrease in available pyrimidine sugars after the
depletion of pyrimidine pools as a consequence of
 xxxg633xxx  inhibition-caused perturbation of protein
glycosylation events žpeters et al., 1990a; allison et
al., 1993; ruckemann et al., 1998.. the higher sensitivity to a77 1726 action observed with activated b
cells over that of t cells may be partially explained
by the high requirements of ribonucleotide sugars
intended for glycosylating the large amounts of antibodies produced.
when lymphocytes enter the cell cycle after stimulation by mitogens or antigen-presenting cells, they
are confronted with an enormous need for metabolic
precursors in anticipation of duplicating their chromatin and doubling their membrane phospholipid
content in preparation for cell division žjackowski,
1996.. although enzymes of the salvage pathway are
present in activated t cells, this pathway provides
only 20% of the required precursors in these cells
and does not sufficiently fulfill the need for increased ribonucleotide levels. therefore, de novo
ribonucleotide synthesis is enhanced which leads to
an 8-fold increase in pyrimidine ribonucleotide ži.e.
utp, ctp. production, compared to only a 2-fold
increase for purine ribonucleotides ži.e. atp, gtp.
žfairbanks et al., 1995..
using these facts as a foundation, several lines of
evidence suggest that the enzyme  xxxg633xxx  is the
preferential target of a77 1726. various in vitro
studies have shown that a77 1726 is a non-cytotoxic
inhibitor of cell proliferation and that addition of
exogenous pyrimidines ži.e. uridine., but not purines,
reverses the antiproliferative effects of a77 1726 and

282

m.l. herrmann et al.r immunopharmacology 47 (2000) 273–289

replenishes nucleotide pools žcherwinski et al.,
1995b; nair et al., 1995; williamson et al., 1995;
ruckemann et al., 1998.. this suggests that dose-dependent depletion of pyrimidine ribonucleotides is
responsible for the actions of a77 1726. although
these uridine reversal experiments support the mechanism of action for  xxxd2450xxx  involving inhibition
of pyrimidine nucleotide production, they must be
interpreted cautiously. addition of exogenous uridine
cannot replenish all depleted intracellular nucleotide
pool levels žmorford et al., 1994; ruckemann et al.,
1998.. high concentrations of a77 1726 ž100 mm.
impairs the uptake of uridine by human t cells
žruckemann et al., 1998.. moreover, nucleoside uptake into lymphocytes is influenced not only by the
rate of rna synthesis, but by permeation into the
cell žtransport., rate of phosphorylation and nucleotide pool size žwierda and pazdernik, 1981;
cohen et al., 1983; karle et al., 1984.. interspecies
differences in purine and pyrimidine metabolic pathways cell phenotype, cellular activity, or functional
state will differentially modulate nucleoside accumulation. for example, the use of results from rodent
purinerpyrimidine metabolic pathways, which are
understood to be unsuitable models to study human
purinerpyrimidine metabolism in lymphocytes, may
only confuse existing models of the mode of action
in corresponding human pathways žhershfield and
mitchell, 1995; simmonds, 1995.. both its transport
into the cell and the subsequent conversion of uridine are dependent on multiple and disparate processes, some of which may be indirectly inhibited by
a77 1726. as a consequence, the addition of uridine
to in vitro cytokinetic assays can only safely be used
to confirm the presence of  xxxg633xxx  inhibitory component and not indicate multiple drug properties, as
often argued in the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibition models
after it was recognized that uridine failed to reverse
all observed drug effects.
therefore, among the different de novo ribonucleotide synthesis enzymes that have been investigated, only  xxxg633xxx  was found to be significantly
inhibited by a77 1726 in a number of species žgreene
et al., 1995; williamson et al., 1995; davis et al.,
1996; bruneau et al., 1998; knecht and loffler,
1998.. the ic 50 for inhibition of purified  xxxg633xxx 
ž k i s 179 nm, for truncated human recombinant
 xxxg633xxx . from different species correlates closely

with its antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects; potent  xxxg633xxx  inhibitors show good in vivo
activity in tested inflammatory models and cell lines,
and poor enzyme inhibitors in vitro exhibit poor in
vivo pharmacology. the excellent correlation of in
vivo and in vitro potencies gives further support to
the inhibition of de novo synthesis as the molecular
mode of action of  xxxd2450xxx . in addition, other
studies have demonstrated a high specificity of a77
1726 for its molecular target and thus provide further
support for a tight structure–activity relationship for
this class of compounds žwilliamson et al., 1995;
kuo et al., 1996; papageorgiou et al., 1998; mahajan
et al., 1999..
inhibition of  xxxg633xxx  was predicted to have an
antiproliferative effect on a wide range of primary
cells and cell lines due to the depletion of intracellular nucleotide pools, as shown for other inhibitors of pyrimidine de novo synthesis žo’dwyer,
1990; allison and eugui, 1993.. detailed kinetic
studies have revealed that  xxxd2450xxx ’s active
metabolite a77 1726 is an uncompetitive inhibitor of
 xxxg633xxx  ždavis et al., 1996; knecht et al., 1996;
knecht and loffler, 1998.. the possibility that the
inhibition of pyrimidine de novo synthesis could be
responsible for the mode of action of  xxxd2450xxx  in
vivo is indicated by the ability of uridine to protect
acute graft versus host response in mice žwilliamson
et al., 1995., reverse lymphocyte proliferation in
vivo žsilva et al., 1996b., and reduce  xxxg633xxx  activity of lymphocytes which infiltrate heart allograft
tissue after  xxxd2450xxx  treatment žsilva et al., 1997..
further evidence for the importance of  xxxg633xxx 
inhibition for the in vivo effects of  xxxd2450xxx  is
demonstrated by the accumulation of dihydroorotate,
the substrate of  xxxg633xxx , in the serum of  xxxd2450xxx -treated rats žmilbert et al., 1998..
the reported cell cycle effects on a77 1726treated primary cells and cell lines show an accumulation of cells at the g1rs boundary žcherwinski et
al., 1995a; herrmann et al., 1997.. other pyrimidine
de novo synthesis inhibitors, such as sodium  xxxd363xxx  žpeters et al., 1990b. or pala žagarwal et
al., 1998., exert similar cell cycle effects, supporting
the contention that a77 1726 interferes with the
production of pyrimidine ribonucleotides.
the molecular mediator of the reported cell cycle
and antiproliferative effects of a77 1726 in t cells

m.l. herrmann et al.r immunopharmacology 47 (2000) 273–289

has been shown to be the tumor suppressor protein
p53 žherrmann et al., 1997.. this study provides
evidence that depletion of pyrimidine pools by a77
1726 in isolated human t cells leads to a reversible
increase in p53 level. this increase of p53 is regulated through alteration of protein stability and is not
associated with the induction of apoptosis žherrmann
et al., 1997; fox et al., 1998.. in its function as a
transcription factor, p53 activates the expression of
the cyclin-dependent-kinase ž cdk . inhibitor
p21wa f-1rcip-1 žherrmann et al., 1997., which is a
potent inhibitor of cyclinrcdk complexes that drive
progression through the g1 and s phase of the cell
cycle žko and prives, 1996; levine, 1997.. p53 is
capable of monitoring cellular levels of ribonucleotides and regulating the cell’s proliferation rate in
order to prevent the synthesis of dna under unfavorable conditions, for example when low or unbalanced nucleotide pools exist, causing temporal accumulation of cells at the g1 border or in s-phase
žchernova et al., 1995; linke et al., 1996; agarwal
et al., 1998.. activated p53 initiates a series of
events leading to temporal cell cycle arrest and can
trigger apoptosis žko and prives, 1996; levine,
1997.. therefore, a77 1726-dependent elevation of
p53 levels and p53-dependent g1 or s-phase checkpoints prevent cells from proliferating under unfavorable conditions and protect the cells from dna
damage in response to a depleted nucleotide pool.
taken together, these data suggest strongly that
the relevant mechanism of action of  xxxd2450xxx  is
the inhibition of the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines.

10. conclusion
 xxxd2450xxx  is a novel drug with both anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties. although different modes of action have been proposed, there is compelling evidence which suggests
that the inhibition of  xxxg633xxx  by a77 1726 is of
paramount importance to the mode of action of
 xxxd2450xxx . the inhibition of this key enzyme in the
de novo synthesis pathway of pyrimidines will preferentially inactivate cells, which depend strongly on
this pathway, including stimulated t and b-lymphocytes žfig. 2.. the susceptibility of cells to lefluno-

283

fig. 2. schematic summary of the proposed consequences of
pyrimidine de novo synthesis inhibition by  xxxd2450xxx  in activated lymphocytes. depletion of pyrimidine nucleotide pools will
have a direct impact on important precursors for rna and dna
synthesis, membrane lipid biosynthesis and protein glycosylation.

mide treatment depends strongly upon their activation state, current metabolic needs, and ability to
circumvent the inhibition by utilizing salvage pathway mechanisms.
a full understanding of the impact of the inhibition of such a critical mechanism and determination
of its function in pathological processes will be
interesting challenges for future experiments. it is
still not clear whether  xxxd2450xxx  treatment simply
keeps the immune response in balance by inhibiting
clonal expansion, or by deleting autoreactive t and
b-lymphocytes. another interesting question that
arises is whether cytostatic drugs like  xxxd2450xxx 
alter the general activation state of the cell with
effects of lymphocyte homeostasis and differentiation into th 1 or th 2 cells. it has been reported
elsewhere that the reduction of signaling strength
seems to shift the immune system towards a th 2
phenotype, which would be beneficial in th 1-mediated diseases including ra žsloan-lancaster and
allen, 1996; constant and bottomly, 1997.. this
conceptual model may serve as a starting point for
future investigation to determine whether ža.  xxxd2450xxx  treatment leads to a general homeostatic shift
in the th 1rth 2 balance by dampening the responsiveness of static cells, or žb. whether drug treatment
leads to an ‘‘anergized’’ phenotype of affected cells,

284

m.l. herrmann et al.r immunopharmacology 47 (2000) 273–289

resulting in a population of suppressor t cells which
serve to regulate the immune response, as indicated
above žqin et al., 1993; lombardi et al., 1994..
currently, little is known about the potential effects
of nucleotide depletion by  xxxd2450xxx  on protein
glycosylation events. this could have major consequences for the recruitment of cells with a high
extravasation potential, such as th 1 cells recruited to
the site of inflammation. alteration of the glycosylation patterns on cell surface molecules may also be
responsible for the reported inhibition of cell–cell
contact activation of macrophages and synoviocytes
by activated t cells, ultimately leading to cessation
of the cellular cascades in ra which cause joint
destruction.
the solutions to these questions present major
experimental challenges, but the answers promise
exciting new insights into the cellular processes involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases
and will help to develop novel, more efficient drugs
in the future.
