 xxxd1972xxx  was designed as an enzyme-activated irreversible
inhibitor of odc (22-24). as predicted, incubation of the
eukaryote enzyme with  xxxd1972xxx  leads to anirreversible loss of
enzyme activity. the inhibition of t.brucei odc is of major
pharmacological importance since african sleeping sickness
caused by this organism is very effectively treated by this
drug, which is now in clinical usage for this purpose.  xxxd1972xxx 
may also have therapeutic potential for a number of other
illnesses caused by protozoansand for diseases involving
abnormal cellular proliferation, including cancer (25-27). as
predicted from the proposed mechanism (22-24), the inactivation of mouse odc by  xxxd1972xxx  involves the decarboxylation
of  xxxd1972xxx  by the enzyme and the stoichiometric binding
of a
metabolite to the protein (28, 29). in the present paper we
have determined the amino
acid residuesin mouse odc which
are involved in the covalent binding of  xxxd1972xxx , determined
the structureof the major adduct, andlocated the lysyl residue
forming a schiff base with plp. these results provide additional information on the mechanism
of action of  xxxd1972xxx  and
on the active site of odc.

resulting in 298% inactivation of the enzyme. the enzyme solution
was concentrated to0.8-1.2 ml using a centricon-10 microconcentrator and dialyzed for 24 h against 3 x 500-ml portions of buffer a.
the  xxxd1972xxx -enzyme adduct was then allowed to react for 2 h a t

al. (36). after dialysis against 1 liter of buffer a, and then 2 x 1-liter

peptide sequencing performed on the labeled peptides as described

as described above. after carboxymethylation of the reduced protein,
the enzyme solution was dialyzed against 2 x 2-liter changes of trypsin

followed by a linear gradient of 5 0 4 0 % (v/v) acetonitrile over 10

times observed for the labeled peptidesgenerated by thetryptic
digestion of ["cidfmo-labeled odc processed under identical conditions. the hplc fractions containing these peptides
were collected
manually into glass test tubes, the sample was neutralized by the
addition of 25 mm nh,hco:, from a 1 m stock solution, ph 8.0, and
the fractions were dried down with a speed-vac concentrator. samples were redissolved in 30 p1 of acetonitrile/water (30:70, v/v) prior
to analysisby fab-mass spectrometry and aminoacid analysis.
fab mass spect,ra were acquired using a zab2-se double-focusing
mass spectrometer(vg analytical) at a mass resolution of 2,200 (10%
valley). ionization was accomplished by a cesium ion source operating
at ananode potentialof +30 kv. the ion source acceleration potential
was +8 kv. the magnet was scanned from m/z 2,350 to 1,400 using
an exponential profile at 100 s/decade to give a total scan time of
about 20 s. sample preparation for fab consisted of applying a few
p1 of the peptide solution to the fab probe tip
followed by the
addition of1-2 pl of a freshly prepared fab matrix composed of
 xxxd2668xxx , dithiothreitol, dithioerythritol (6:5:1, w/w/w).
five-pl aliquots of the peptide solutions used for fab-ms were
taken for amino acid analysisusing an aminoquant aa analyzer
(hewlett-packard). this system combines precolumn derivatization

in uacuu for 24 h a t 105 "c using 6 m hci.
spectrophotometric analysis of odc inactivation by  xxxd1972xxx -purified recombinant mouse odc (300 pg) in buffer a containing 50
p m plp was loaded on a pd-10 gel filtration column and elutedwith
plp-free buffer a. the volume was then reduced to 1.3 ml using a
centricon-10microconcentrator,and
100 p l of thissolution was
transferred to a quartz microcuvette for spectrophotometry. ultraviolet and visible spectra of this odc solution (5 p ~ were
)
then
obtained using a beckman du-65 spectrophotometer. the spectral
changes resultingfrom the reaction of  xxxd1972xxx  withodc were studied
by obtaining spectra (280-540 nm) of the enzyme solution a t various
intervals after the addition of 100 p~  xxxd1972xxx  directly to the cuvette.
the filtrate from the ultrafiltration step used to concentrate the
enzyme was used as a blank for the spectrophotometric measurements.
the stability of plp binding to the  xxxd1972xxx -inactivated odc was
studied by comparing its absorption spectrum
with that of the apoenzyme by a modification of a published method(36,39). all operations
were performed in the dark to
minimize photodecomposition of plp.
first, 140-pg portions of a 5 p~ solution of recombinant mouse odc
in buffer a containing 50p~ plp were incubated for 60 min at 37 "c
in thepresence or absence of 100 p~  xxxd1972xxx  and thendialyzed for 24
h against 3 x 500-ml portions of plp-free buffer a. after obtaining
absorption spectra of the dialyzed enzyme, l-cysteine hc1 in sodium
phosphate buffer, p  xxxd736xxx .0, was added to a final concentration of 50
mm l-cysteine and inorganic phosphate. the mixture was incubated
for 60 min at 25 "c underan n, atmosphereandthen
dialyzed
overnight at 4 "cagainst 500 ml of 100 mm l-cysteine hci, 100 mm
sodium phosphate, ph 8.0, and then 2 x 500 ml of buffer a. the
absorption spectra were taken after concentration to 750 p l with a
centricon-10 microconcentrator.
miscellaneous procedures-protein hydrolysis
was performed for
24 h in an evacuated flask with phenolic 6 n hydrochloric acid. free
amino acids were then derivatized with phenyl isothiocyanate and
analyzed with a picotag (waters) hplc system (40). odc activity
was determined by measuring the release of"co, from l-[~-"c]
ornithine during a30-min assay a t 37 "c (28).one unit of odc
activity is defined as the amount of 14c02produced in pmol/min.
 xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10%
(w/v) acrylamide was performed according to the methodof laemmli
(41). protein was determined by the method of bradford (42) using
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (fraction v; miles laboratories, elkhart, in)
as standard.
results

expression and purification of recombinant mouseodcthe level of expression of recombinant mouse odc in e. coli
ewh331-pin-odc-5 transformants after stimulation with
iptg was sufficiently high (about 3-6% of the total soluble
protein) that odc of sufficient purity for sequencing was
obtained after affinity chromatography of the fraction of the
crude soluble proteinsprecipitating between 30 and 50%
(nh,),so, on a pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate-agarose column.
large scale preparations typically showed a recovery of the
order of 80-90% at the affinity chromatography step. the
specific activity of the purified recombinant mouse odc was
48 & 7 units/mg of protein, very similar to that reported for
the homogeneous enzyme purified from mouse kidney (34).
thus, although the expression plasmid construction results
in analterationintheaminoterminus
of the enzyme
(mssftkd- being changed to mkgk- in the recombinant
enzyme), the catalytic activity of the recombinant enzyme is
not significantly affected by the modification. this is consistent with the lack of conservation of thisamino-terminal
region between known odc sequences.

isolation of sites of binding of  xxxd1972xxx  to mouse odcinitial experimentsshowed that afterinactivation by reaction
with [5-i4c] xxxd1972xxx ,19.1 nmol of the inhibitor was incorporated per mg of purified odc after gel filtration and extensive
dialysis, corresponding to 19.7 nmol of enzyme subunit (based
on an m , of 50,730). thus,the stoichiometry of  xxxd1972xxx 
binding to recombinant mouse odc is very close to 1 mol/
subunit as determined previously for wild-type mouse odc
(28, 29).
the adduct formed between  xxxd1972xxx  and mammalian odc
has been reported to be remarkably stable to treatmentssuch
as heating inthe presence of hc10, or  xxxd3215xxx ,
precipitation with (nh,),so,, or extensive dialysis (28). in
the present experiments no detectable loss of radioactivity
could be measured after extensive dialysis of recombinant
mouse odc labeled with [5-14c]dfm0even in the presence
of 8 m urea, and prior treatment of the adduct with nabh,
or nacnbh, had no effect on the stability of the label under
these conditions. however, exposure to low ph under denaturing conditions as used for peptide isolation resulted in a
considerable loss of radioactivity from [5-'4c] xxxd1972xxx -labeled
odc (data not shown). thus, the  xxxd1972xxx -odc adduct peptide(s) may be considerably more stable than the complexes
formed in the reactions of other plp-dependent enzymes

in eithersample. the spectrum infig. 8a shows an m/z value
of 1,903.6 for the most intense peak in the (m h)’ isotope
cluster for tryptic fragment a. the nominal molecular mass
indicated by the isotope distribution is 1,901 or 83 daltons
higher than the 1,818 molecular mass of the proposed tryptic
fragment yysssiwgptcdgldr. the protonated
molecular cluster infig. 8b shows an m/z 1,899.7 as themost intense
peak and indicates that the minor tryptic fragment b had a
nominal molecular weight of 1,897. amino acid analysis run
on peptidesa and b yielded almost identical results: tyr (1.71,
1.77), ser (2.77, 2.66), gly (1.90, 2.061, pro (0.87, 0.94), thr
(1.22,0.90), cys (0.97, 1.30), asx (2.34,2.42), arg (0.97,0.91);
the values in parentheses correspond to a and b, respectively.
the presence of a large sample-related peak which eluted in
the vicinity of leucine and isoleucine restricted quantitation
of these residues. in addition, tryptophan could not be quantified reliably because of degradation commonly associated
with this residue during hydrolysis. nonetheless, the results
confirm that both peptides a and b were derived from the
proposed tryptic fragment containingcys-360.
the results obtainedby fab-ms enabled the natureof the
covalent adduct to cys-360 to be deduced. as shown by the
by the
data in fig. 8, the molecularmassincreasecaused
adduct in cys-360 was 83 and 79 daltons, respectively for
peptides a and b. both of these values are less than the
molecular weight of either  xxxd1972xxx  or plp. assuming that
inactivation was caused by the alkylation of cysteine, the
number of plausible elemental compositions for each adduct
is relatively few. a further constraint is that both adducts
must contain an odd number of nitrogen atoms since the
molecular weightswere increased by an odd number (nitrogen
rule). the mostlikely composition for the alkylatinggroup of
the major product (peptide a ) is c5hi,,n. based on the data
obtained from fab-ms, amino acidanalysis, and peptide
sequencing, it is apparent that  xxxd1972xxx  binds to cys-360 to
give an s-((2-(l-pyrroline))methyl)cysteinederivative which
is oxidized to the s-((2-pyrrole)methyl)cysteine adduct (minor) or reduced to s-((2-pyrrolidine)methyl)cysteine in the
presence of nabh, (major). the structures for the observed
adducts to peptides a and b are shown in fig. 9 and are
consistent with the proposed model for the action of  xxxd1972xxx 
(24). in the original mechanism for inactivation of odc by
 xxxd1972xxx  (22), the exact
nucleophile on the proteinwhich binds
to  xxxd1972xxx  was not specified. the sequencing data in fig. 4
indicate that the pth-derivative resulting
from position 360
of mouse odc could not be identified and contained thebulk
of the ’“cradioactive label. these observations pointstrongly
to the thiol on cys-360 as the nucleophilic group. further,
these data eliminate other potentialnucleophilic residues on
the peptide sequenced (e.g. tyrosine, serine, threonine, arginine) as binding sites for  xxxd1972xxx . unfortunately, the amino
acid analysis data acquired for peptides a and b could not be
used to corroborate thesefindings since the covalent adducts
to these peptides were apparently cleaved under the conditions used for hydrolysis. the amino acid analysis data did
confirm, however, that peptides a and b were products of the
same tryptic fragmentwhich contained cys-360.
spectral characteristics of native and  xxxd1972xxx -inactivated
mouse odc-the visible spectrum of purified recombinant
mouse odc exhibits two absorption maxima, namely at 339
and 418 nm (fig. 10). thepresence of two absorption maxima
close to these two wavelengths is characteristic of a-decarboxylases (39, 45, 46). several possible enzyme-bound coenzyme forms, including an uncharged schiff base (enolimine
form), an internal aldimine, or pyridoxamine 5”phosphate
(45, 47, 48), can account for the maximum a t 330-340 nm.
