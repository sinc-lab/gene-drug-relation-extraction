abstract
the effects of acute administration of  xxxd3195xxx  on da output were
examined in the shell part of the nucleus accumbens (nacs) and the striatum (str),
areas which are associated with limbic functions and motor control, respectively, by
using in vivo differential normal pulse voltammetry in rats. the effect of  xxxd3195xxx  was
compared to those obtained with the reference antipsychotic drugs clozapine and haloperidol, new generation antipsychotics represented by risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, as well as, with those of preferential d2/3, d4, 5-ht1a,
5-ht2a, 5-ht2c, a1, and a2 receptor ligands. in similarity with the new generation antipsychotics,  xxxd3195xxx  preferentially increase da output in the nacs as compared to the
str whereas the opposite was true for haloperidol. the regional speciﬁc effect of the partial  xxxg656xxx  agonist aripiprazole was mainly driven by a decrease in striatal rather
that by an increase in accumbal da output. the selective 5-ht2a and  xxxg658xxx  antagonists mdl100,151 and lu 38-012, respectively, both preferentially increased da output
in the nacs. thus, the present results are in line with the hypothesis that  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism is of importance for the observed limbic selectivity of new generation
antipsychotics and, in turn, to their favorable clinical proﬁle especially as regards
extrapyramidal side effects (eps) liability. for some compounds, blockade of d4 receptors may also play a role in this regard. synapse 60:543–552, 2006. v 2006 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction
several lines of evidence indicate that antipsychotic
drugs have one principal common denominator as
regards their mechanism of action, i.e., they interfere
brain da mediated neurotransmission. in fact, it
appears that all currently used antipsychotic drugs
share the ability to occupy striatal da d2 receptors at
clinically relevant doses (for recent review see talbot
and laruelle (2002)). however, the degree of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy needed for clinical efﬁcacy does vary signiﬁcantly between different antipsychotic drugs. thus,
while classical neuroleptics such as haloperidol usually
are clinically effective at around 70%  xxxg656xxx  occupancy in brain, other drugs such as clozapine are clinically effective already at occupancies below 50% (farde
et al., 1988; tauscher et al., 2002). this may well
underlay the fact that clozapine causes very few, if any,

extrapyramidal side effects (eps; safferman et al.,
1991) as it appears that the risk for inducing motor side
effects is becoming very high at  xxxg656xxx  occupancies above 80% (farde et al., 1992).
the underlying mechanism for clozapine’s ability to
possess clinical efﬁcacy at low levels of striatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy has been the topic in numerous studies but still remain to be clariﬁed. this is in part attributed to clozapine’s rather complex receptor binding
proﬁle which, apart from d2 receptors, also includes d1
and d4 receptors, a1- and a2- adrenoceptors, 5-hydroxy*correspondence to: dr. p. hertel. e-mail: phertel@jacdk.jnj.com

tryptamine (5-ht)2a receptors, and other 5-ht, muscarinic and histaminergic receptors, etc (see http://
pdsp.cwru.edu/pdsp.asp for an on-line searchable database of drug/receptor afﬁnities in the public domain).
nevertheless, it has been suggested that the beneﬁcial
clinical proﬁle of clozapine as well other so-called atypical or new generation antipsychotics such as  xxxd3195xxx 
(zimbroff et al., 1997), risperidone (borison et al.,
1992), olanzapine (beasley et al., 1997), ziprasidone
(keck et al., 1998), and quetiapine (fabre et al., 1995)
with reduced eps liability is attributed to a preferential action on the limibic system. thus, in contrast to
classical antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol, clozapine have been shown by means of behavioral (see e.g.,
ögren (1996)), electrophysiological (see e.g., chiodo
and bunney (1983) and white and wang (1983)), and
biochemical techniques (see e.g., andén and stock
(1973) and hertel et al. (1996)) to selectively target the
mesolimbic da system, while leaving the nigrostriatal
projection relatively unaffected. furthermore, marcus
and coworkers have in a series of studies investigated
the effect of antipsychotic drugs on the outﬂow of da
in shell subdivision of the nucleus accumbens (nacs)
as compared to the effect in the core part of this
nuclei using in vivo voltammetry (marcus et al., 1996,
2000, 2002). they concluded that antipsychotic drugs
with reduced eps potential preferentially affected the
da outﬂow in the nacs as compared to the core region
of the nac. this is of particular interest as these two
subregions can be anatomically and functionally separated. thus, it has been suggested that the nacs subregion constitute a mesolimbic sector involved in
emotional and motivational processes while the core
subregion comprises a striatal sector that plays a role
predominantly in motor functions (deutch and
cameron, 1992; zahm, 1999). therefore, the ﬁndings of
marcus et al. are in line with the hypothesis that antipsychotic drugs that posses low eps liability preferentially affect mesolimbic as compared to mesostriatal
da functions. their studies also indicated that a1 and
 xxxg1113xxx  antagonism may contribute to the
preferential effect of these atypical drugs on da output
in the nacs (marcus et al., 2000).
in the light of these observations, the present study,
using in vivo differential normal pulse voltammetry
(dnpv), was employed to further elucidate the potential regional selectivity of  xxxd3195xxx  as well as of several other new generation antipsychotics, including
risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, and
aripiprazole on da output in striatal and mesolimbic
areas. to extend the knowledge of the regional effects
of the new generation of antipsychotics using this technique, the effects of the drugs were measured in the
striatum instead of the core region of the nac as previously investigated by marcus et al. (1996, 2000, 2002).
in an attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanism
for the observed regional differences of the new generasynapse doi 10.1002/syn

tion antipsychotics, the results were compared to those
of haloperidol and clozapine as well as to those
obtained with preferential d2/3, d4, 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a, 5ht2c, a1, and a2 receptor ligands.
materials and methods
animals and surgery
male wistar rats (m&b a/s, denmark) weighing
300–350 g were used in all experiments. the rats were
housed in groups of 2–4 under environmentally controlled conditions on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on
at 6 a.m.) and allowed standard rodent food and water
ad libitum. all experiments performed in this study
were conducted in accordance with the danish legislation of animal use for scientiﬁc procedures as described
in the \animal testing act" (consolidation act no. 726
of 9 september 1993 as amended by act no. 1081 of 20
december 1995).
rats were pretreated with  xxxd2850xxx  (75 mg/kg, i.p.)
to block da degradation and 1 h later anesthetized
with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.). the femoral and
the jugular vein were catheterized for future drug
administration and continuous chloral hydrate infusion (100 mg/kg/h), respectively. the rats were kept
under anesthesia throughout the entire experiment
and the body temperature was maintained at 378c by
means of a thermostatic controlled heating pad (model
150, cma, sweden). the rats were mounted in a stereotaxic frame and the skull and dura mater were
exposed at the level of the nacs or str. the pia mater
was punctured by means of a used carbon ﬁber electrode. a freshly treated carbon ﬁber electrode (see
later) was implanted in the nacs or str using the following coordinates: 1.6 or 1.0 mm anterior to bregma,
0.7 or 3.1 mm lateral to the mid line, and 7.0 or 4.5 mm
below the cortical surface, respectively (paxinos and
watson, 1986).
electrochemical techniques
a three-electrode system (the carbon ﬁber electrode,
an ag/agcl reference electrode, and an auxiliary electrode made of platinum wire) was connected to a pulse
voltammetric system (biopulse, tacussel, france). the
carbon ﬁber electrodes (12 mm in diameter and an
exposed length of 500 mm; tacussel, france) were electrochemically treated using the biopulse according to a
procedure slightly modiﬁed from that previously
described (gonon et al., 1984): an anodic potential of a
triangular wave form (initial potential, 0 v; amplitude,
2.6–2.8 v; frequency, 70 hz) was applied for 20 s followed by two successive continuous potentials (0.7 v
and then 1.5 v) for 5 s. during this treatment, the three
electrodes were immersed in a pbs solution. thereafter, the carbon ﬁber electrode was stereotaxically
lowered into the nacs or str, whereas the auxiliary
and reference electrodes were maintained in contact

with the skull by means of a semiliquid junction (gelatin sponge moistened with 0.9% nacl solution). the
catechol oxidation current in the nacs or str was
monitored using the biopulse system. differential normal pulse voltammetry (dnpv) was used to record voltammograms every minute with parameters previously
described (gonon, 1988). given the electrochemical
treatment of the carbon ﬁbers electrodes and the  xxxd2850xxx  pretreatment of the rats, the recorded catechol signal is attributed to da oxidation with minimal interference of ascorbate and dopac oxidation current (gonon
et al., 1984). the oxidation signal was fed via an interface (power 1401, ced, uk) in to a pc and the voltammograms were monitored and analyzed on-line by the
signal 2.00 software (ced, uk). after establishment of
a stabile baseline (<10% variation of the area under
the da peak), the animal was injected i.v. with drug or
vehicle. at the end of each experiment, the recording
site was marked by applying a high potential to the carbon ﬁber electrode (5 v for 5 s). the rats were killed by
an overdose of anesthetic and their brains were frozen,
sliced, and examined under microscope for electrode
placement.
data analysis
the area under the da peak was calculated for each
voltammogram and expressed as % baseline (deﬁned as
the average of the last ﬁve preinjection values). the
mean (6sem) percentages were calculated for each
sample across the rats in all groups. the data were
statistically analyzed by two-way (area  time) analysis of variance (anova) for repeated measures. data
were also calculated and presented as average (6sem)
percent changes of baseline during a 15 min time
period after each drug injection (overall effect). oneway anova was used for statistical evaluation of
the overall effects followed tukey test for multiple
comparisons.
drugs
 xxxd3195xxx  (synthesized at h. lundbeck a/s, denmark), clozapine (novartis, switzerland), olanzapine
(synthesized at h. lundbeck a/s), and risperidone
(janssen, belgium) were dissolved in 0.1 m hcl and
diluted with a 0.9% nacl solution. idazoxan (purchased from sigma, usa), mdl 100,151 (1-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-ﬂuorophenyl)ethyl]piperidin-4ylmethanol; synthesized at h. lundbeck a/s), raclopride
(purchased from sigma), quetiapine (synthesized at h.
lundbeck a/s, denmark), and 8-oh-dpat (purchased
from sigma) were dissolved in a 0.9% nacl solution. aripiprazole (synthesized at h. lundbeck a/s, denmark)
and ziprasidone (synthesized at h. lundbeck a/s, denmark) were dissolved in a 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin solution containing 1 m methane sulfonic acid.
haloperidol (purchased from sigma) was dissolved in a

0.9% nacl solution containing 0.1 m tartaric acid. sb
242084 (purchased from sigma) was dissolved in a 10%
2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin solution.  xxxd3000xxx  (purchased from sigma) was dissolved in distilled water. the
ph of the drug solutions was adjusted to 5–7 before
administration. all drug doses are expressed as mg/kg
active substance.
selection of doses
the doses of all the antipsychotic drugs in this study
were selected based on a series of pilot studies. after
deﬁning a dose that caused a robust effect in the nacs,
a four times lower dose was employed as the starting
dose. an identical approach was applied for the selective receptor ligands. however, when an effective dose
was impossible to ﬁnd, the highest dose was selected
based on previous literature. the dose range of 8-ohdopamine transporter (dat) was based on previous
data showing that doses around 0.05 mg/kg i.v. causes
a complete inhibition of the ﬁring of 5-ht neurons in
the dorsal raphe nucleus, indicating a signiﬁcant  xxxg1108xxx  receptor agonistic effect in the used dose range
(see e.g., martin-ruiz and ugedo, 2001). the used doserange of sb 242084 most likely induces full blockade of
5-ht2c receptors, as previous studies have shown that
sb 242084 at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg i.v. completely counteracts the inhibitory effect of 5-ht2c agonism on da
cell ﬁring in the ventral tegmental area (vta; di matteo et al., 2000). likewise, the used dose-range of  xxxd3000xxx  most likely indices a high degree of central a1
adrenoceptor blockade, as this drug already at doses
less than 1 mg/kg s.c. exhibit central a1 andrenoceptor
antagonism as measured by inhibition of isoniazideinduced convulsions (data on ﬁle, h. lundbeck a/s).
finally, it has been shown that idazoxan at doses
around 0.1 mg/kg i.v. interferes with central a2 adrenoceptor-mediated transmission (see e.g., linner et al.,
1999).
results
effect of vehicle administration
none of the used vehicles (see drugs) affected da
output in the nacs or str within the used sampling
period (30 min after injection; data not shown).
effect of clozapine and haloperidol on da
output in nacs and str
clozapine preferentially increased the da output in
the nacs as compared to the str, whereas the opposite was true for haloperidol (fig. 1; see figs. 2 and 3
for comparison to new generation antipsychotics and
selective receptor, respectively). thus, the anovas on
the data indicated a signiﬁcant area effect in the case
of both clozapine (f ¼ 78,3; p < 0.001) and haloperidol
(f ¼ 86.1; p < 0.001). statistical analysis (one-way

output indicated a signiﬁcance between group effect
(fig. 4; f ¼ 22.4; p < 0.001). the subsequent posthoc
analysis indicated that clozapine at the low dose (2.5
mg/kg i.v.) caused a statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05)
greater increase in da overall output in the nacs vs.
the str. although clozapine at the high dose (10.0 mg/
kg i.v.) caused a numerically greater increase in da
overall output in the nacs compared to the str, this
difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (p ¼
0.097). the posthoc analysis also revealed that clozapine at 2.5 mg/kg i.v. signiﬁcantly increased overall da
output in the nacs (p < 0.05) as compared to baseline
but failed to do so in the str. the high dose of clozapine signiﬁcantly increased the overall da output in
both the nacs and str as compared to their respective
baseline (p < 0.05). statistical analysis (one-way
anova) of the effect of haloperidol on the overall da
output indicated a signiﬁcance between group effect
(fig. 4; f ¼ 13.9; p < 0.001). although that haloperidol
at both doses (0.31 and 1.25 mg/kg i.v.) caused a numerically larger increase in overall da output in the str as
compared to the nacs, these differences did not reach
statistically signiﬁcance. however, at the high dose of
haloperidol (1.25 mg/kg i.v.) a strong tendency for a difference between the areas was indicated (p ¼ 0.076).
furthermore, the statistical analysis indicated that
both doses of haloperidol signiﬁcantly enhanced the
overall da output in the str, whereas the drug failed
to affect the levels in the nacs as compared to baseline.

pine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, differentially affected the da output in the nacs as compared to the str (fig. 2). thus, in all these cases, the
anovas indicated a signiﬁcant area effect (f ¼ 348,
p < 0.01; f ¼ 274, p < 0.001; f ¼ 194, p < 0.001; f ¼
52.5, p < 0.01; f ¼ 117, p > 0.001; and f ¼ 69.8, p <
0.001, respectively). corresponding region selectivity
was revealed when statistically analyzing (one-way
anova) the effects of these drugs on overall da output
with the exception of aripiprazole (fig. 4). thus, all
anovas on the data obtained with  xxxd3195xxx , risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and quetiapine indicated a signiﬁcance between group effect (f ¼ 24.3, p <
0.001; f ¼ 26.2, p < 0.001; f ¼ 8.34, p < 0.001; f ¼
5.05, p < 0.001; and f ¼ 5.39, p < 0.001, respectively).
although aripiprazole appeared to differentially affect
the overall da output in the nacs vs. the str, this
difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (f ¼
2.0, p ¼ 0.106). the subsequent posthoc analysis indicated that  xxxd3195xxx  (1.25 mg/kg, i.v.), risperidone
(0.16 and 0.63 mg/kg, i.v.), olanzapine (0.16 and
0.63 mg/kg, i.v.), and quetiapine (4.3 mg/kg, i.v.)
induced a signiﬁcantly more pronounced effect on overall da output in nacs as compared to str. moreover,
none of the tested new generation of antipsychotics
increased the overall output of da in str as compared
to baseline, whereas all of them, with the exception of
aripiprazole, enhanced this parameter in the nacs.

however, in contrast to lu 38-012 and mdl 100,151,

described in the literature using a variety of different
techniques (see introduction). for example, clozapine
has been distinguished from classical  xxxg656xxx 
blocking drugs based on its regional effects on da neurochemistry as measured by microdialysis. studies in
both rodents and nonhuman primates have shown that
acute administration of clozapine results in a more
prominent increase of da output in mesocorticolimbic
areas in contrast to classical antipsychotic drugs,
which instead preferentially activate such parameter
in terminal regions associated with the nigrostriatal
system (hernandez and hoebel, 1995; hertel et al.,
1996; millan et al., 1998; moghaddam and bunney,
1990; youngren et al., 1999). indirect evidences also
indicate that clozapine possesses such limbic selectivity
in clinical settings. assuming that the antipsychotic
effect of antipsychotic drugs is executed via interference with the limbic da system, the ﬁnding that clozapine appears to be clinically effective at signiﬁcantly
lower striatal d2 receptors occupancy as compared with
classical antipsychotic compounds may indeed be interpreted as this compound possesses limbic preferentiality (farde et al., 1992). however, the precise mechanism(s) responsible for this purported limbic selectivity
of clozapine remains to be clariﬁed.
the present data show that  xxxd3195xxx  in similarity
with all the investigated new generation antipsychotic
drugs, with the exception of aripiprazole, mimicked the
proﬁle of clozapine in that they all preferentially
increased da output in the nacs as compared to the
str. these ﬁndings are in general concordant with

discussion
the results of the present study show that the socalled new generation antipsychotics, including  xxxd3195xxx , with the exception of aripiprazole preferentially
increase da output in the nacs as compared to the
str. furthermore, the present data indicate that
blockade of 5-ht2a receptors blocking effects of these
compounds contribute to this effects, but the involvement of  xxxg658xxx  antagonism cannot be totally
excluded. thus, the present results are in line with the
hypothesis that 5-ht2a or  xxxg658xxx  antagonism is of
considerable signiﬁcance for the reported limbic selectivity of action of new generation antipsychotics and, in
turn, to their favorable clinical proﬁle especially as
regards eps liability.
in agreement with previous ﬁndings (marcus et al.,
1996), the prototypical representative for the new generation antipsychotics clozapine preferentially enhanced da output in the nacs as compared to the
str, whereas the opposite was observed after administration of the traditional antipsychotic drug haloperidol. in consonance with the ﬁndings of marcus et al.
(1996), the regional difference in response between the
limbic and striatal areas induced by clozapine was most
evident in the lower dose range. a preferential action of
clozapine on the limbic system has frequently been

previous literature showing a preferential action on the
mesocorticolimbic as compared to the nigrostriatal da
system of these compounds (li et al., 1998; marcus
et al., 1996, 2000; rollema et al., 2000; skarsfeldt and
perregaard, 1990). however, it should be noted that
marcus et al. (1996, 2000) found that a preferential
action on the limbic da system of both risperidone and
olanzapine was only observed at lower doses, a pattern
also seen after clozapine administration. again, the
reason for this apparent discrepancy is unknown but
may be related to the fact that the da output was
measured in different striatal areas, i.e., the core of
nac vs. the str.
in an attempt to reveal the receptor mechanisms
involved in observed effects of these antipsychotic
drugs, the effects of selective receptor ligands were
investigated. in this regard, it was found that the selective d2/3 receptor antagonist raclopride (kohler et al.,
1985) mimicked the proﬁle of haloperidol but not the
one of clozapine. this ﬁnding is in agreement with previous data (marcus et al., 1996) and indicates that
other properties than d2/3 receptor antagonism adds to
the limbic selectivity of the second-generation antipsychotic drugs.
while the selective  xxxg1108xxx  agonist 8-ohdpat (bjork et al., 1989) and the selective 5-ht2c antagonist sb 242084 (kennett et al., 1997) failed to signiﬁcantly affect the da output, the selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist mdl 100,151, the racemic form of
mdl 100,907 (palfreyman et al., 1993), increased the
da output in the nacs without affecting this parameter in the str. this effect of  xxxg1113xxx  blockade
is in agreement with previous reports and support the
notion that the 5-ht2a but not the  xxxg1115xxx 
antagonistic action of the new generation antipsychotics contributes to their preferential action on da
output in the mesolimbic system (marcus et al., 2000).
previous electrophysiological and biochemical studies
suggest that blockade of 5-ht2a receptors speciﬁcally
activates the mesolimbic da system. speciﬁcally, it has
been reported that addition of  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists causes potentiation of the stimulatory effects
induced by  xxxg656xxx  blockade on neuronal activity
as well as da output selectively in mesolimbic da projections as opposed to its effect on the nigrostriatal da
pathways (andersson et al., 1995). however, it should
be mentioned that there is also literature indicating
that  xxxg1113xxx  blockade attenuate mesolimbic
dopaminergic activity. for example, pehek et al. (2006)
have recently shown that local cortical administration
of the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist m100,907 inhibits
stress-induced da release. in contrast to  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism, administration of the  xxxg1108xxx 
agonist 8-oh-dpat failed to affect da output in the
herein investigated areas. this ﬁnding is somewhat
controversial, as previous studies have found that
acute stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors attenuate da
synapse doi 10.1002/syn

release in the nac (ichikawa and meltzer, 2000).
although the precise reason for this inconsistency is
unknown, some differences in the methodology between the latter and the present might be involved.
for example, it cannot be ruled out that the use of a
mao inhibitor in the present study may play a role in
this context. apart from that a different technique was
used to measure da output, i.e., voltammetry vs.
microdialysis; the decrease in da output reported by
ichikawa and meltzer (2000) was only seen after a relative high dose of 8-oh-dpat. thus, it is possible that
the doses of 8-oh-dpat used in the present study were
too low to detect an effect on da output. it should also
be mentioned that the maximal effect of 8-oh-dpat on
da decrease was observed 60 min after administration.
although different routes of administration were
employed, it cannot be excluded that the time frame for
detecting an effect of 8-oh-dpat used in the present
study was too short as the effect on da was only monitored for 15 min after drug administration. nevertheless, the available evidences indicate that a combination of 5-ht2a and  xxxg656xxx  blockade promotes a certain degree of limbic selectivity and may well represent
the underlying mechanism for the herein observed
effects of the new generation antipsychotic drugs,
including  xxxd3195xxx . indeed, a high degree of 5-ht2a
receptor occupancy at clinical relevant doses appears
as a common denominator for the new generation antipsychotic drugs (remington and kapur, 1999).
in the present study, it was found that the selective
 xxxg658xxx  antagonist lu 38-012 (h. lundbeck database; (hertel et al., 2002) preferentially and dosedependently increased da output in the nacs
whereas no effect was observed in the str. it might
therefore be speculated that blockade of  xxxg658xxx 
may play a role in regulating da levels in mesolimbic
areas. although further experiments are needed to substantiate this hypothesis, it is also interesting to note
that d4 receptors have been localized on presynaptic
dopaminergic terminals within the nacs (svingos
et al., 2000). thus, there is a biological rational to support a modulatory role of d4 receptors on da release in
the nac. given that clozapine exhibits relatively high
afﬁnity for d4 receptors and appears to behave as an
antagonist at these receptors (arnt and skarsfeldt,
1998; hertel et al. 2002), it cannot be excluded that d4
receptor antagonism contributes to a preferential effect
on nacs vs. striatal da output.
marcus et al. (2000) have previously reported that
the selective a1 adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  modestly, but signiﬁcantly, increases da output selectively
in the shell part as compared to the core part of the
nac. the present study failed to detect a similar preferential action on the mesolimbic system. in fact, both
 xxxd3000xxx  as well as the selective a2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan failed to inﬂuence the da output in the
investigated areas. the effect of  xxxd3000xxx  in the nacs

551

limbic selectivity of  xxxd3195xxx 

reported by marcus et al. (2000) was indeed moderate
and therefore it is possible that subtle differences in
methodology such as differences in vehicle, rat species,
detection sensitivity, et cetera may account for such
discrepancy. the lack of effect of idazoxan on da output in the nac and the striatum is in line with previous studies monitoring the effect of this drug on subcortical da output using microdialysis (hertel et al.,
1999a, 1999b).
in similarity to the other tested antipsychotic drugs,
the novel antipsychotic drug aripiprazole differentially
affected the da output in the nacs vs. the str. however, aripiprazole differed from all the other tested new
generation antipsychotic drugs in the used paradigm in
that the region selectivity was in part driven by an
apparent decrease in striatal da output. in fact, no
other currently used antipsychotic drug has, to the best
of my knowledge, been reported to acutely attenuate
striatal da output. previous microdialysis studies have
reported conﬂicting data on the effect of aripiprazole on
da release in str. thus, semba et al. (1995) reported
that aripiprazole dose-dependently decreased da output in the str, whereas jordan et al. (2004) failed to
ﬁnd any effect of this drug (jordan et al., 2004; semba
et al., 1995). the present data supports the notion that
aripiprazole attenuates the striatal da output, an
effect most likely attributed to  xxxg656xxx  agonism.
thus, aripiprazole has been shown to be a partial  xxxg656xxx  agonist in vitro as well as in vivo (burris et al.,
2002; kikuchi et al., 1995; lawler et al., 1999). it might
therefore be speculated that aripiprazole stimulates d2
autoreceptors which, in turn, results in reduced da
release in terminal regions. as opposed to the str, aripiprazole did not attenuate the da output in the
nacs; if anything, an augmentation was seen in this
area. the reason for this region selectivity is not known
but it can be speculated that the  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonistic property of aripiprazole might counteract
an attenuating effect in this area. moreover, given that
aripiprazole possesses d2 partial agonistic properties,
it cannot be excluded that the differential effect of this
drug in this context is due to regional difference in da
tonus. clearly, additional work is necessary to clarify
this matter.
in conclusion, the present study demonstrates that
antipsychotic drugs with reduced eps liability, including  xxxd3195xxx , may be separated from classical antipsychotic drugs based on their acute, regional effects on
da output in brain. furthermore, the obtained results
support the hypothesis that the preferential effect on
the mesolimbic da is mainly attributed to  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism but a tentative involvement of d4
receptor antagonism cannot be excluded for some antipsychotic drugs. in contrast to the tested antipsychotic
drugs, the regional speciﬁc effect of the partial  xxxg656xxx  agonist aripiprazole on central da output was
mainly driven by a decrease in striatal rather that by

an increase in accumbal da output. the underlying
mechanism for this effect of aripiprazole is currently
not known but it might involve partial  xxxg656xxx  agonism,  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism, or a combination of
these mechanisms. thus, the present results are in line
with the hypothesis that  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism
is of considerable signiﬁcance for a favorable clinical
proﬁle especially as regards eps liability.
