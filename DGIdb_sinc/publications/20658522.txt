the ultimate biological and clinical meaning of shed her2 extracellular domain (ecd) has remained largely unclear until recently.
oversecretion of soluble her2 ecd has been shown to inhibit growth of her2-overexpressing cancer cells by promoting her2 ecd
dimerization with her transmembrane receptors thus impairing their cross-tyrosine phosphorylation and decreasing their activation
status. her2-targeted drugs capable to enhance the occurrence of basal her2 ecd shedding but simultaneously preventing formation
of truncated cell membrane-bound her2 intracellular fragment, which exhibits an undesirable constitutive kinase activity, might be
extremely efficient at managing her2-positive cancer disease. the dual  xxxg682xxx /her2  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor lapatinib, which works
intracellularly and directly targets the tk domain of her2, drastically augments basal shedding of her2 ecd to inhibit her2-driven
cancer cell growth. lapatinib treatment significantly augments the concentration of the inactive (unphosphorylated) form of her2 protein
at the tumor cell membrane and promotes an exacerbated her2 ecd shedding to the extracellular milieu of her2-overexpressing cancer
cells. exacerbated sensitivity of trastuzumab-resistant cancer cells, which contain nearly undetectable levels of soluble her2 ecd when
compared with trastuzumab-sensitive parental cells to lapatinib-induced cell growth inhibition, takes place when lapatinib treatment fully
restores high levels of basal her2 ecd shedding. the dramatic augmentation of her2 ecd shedding that occurs upon treatment of with
lapatinib is fully suppressed in lapatinib-refractory her2-positive cells. these findings, altogether, may provide crucial insights concerning
clinical studies aimed to accurately describe her2 ecd as a potential predictor of response or resistance to the her2-targeted drugs
trastuzumab and lapatinib.

ligand-less her2 is a mr 185,000  xxxg2198xxx  (tk) receptor
of the her (or  xxxg682xxx ) family encoded by the neu protooncogene that is frequently overexpressed in (up to 30%)
human breast carcinomas. the full-length her2 receptor
(p185) undergoes proteolytic cleavage resulting in the release
of a mr 110,000 extracellular domain (ecd; p110) and the
production of a mr 95,000 nh2-terminally truncated
membrane-associated fragment (p95) (molina et al., 2001).
high-serum levels of her2 ecd have been repeatedly
correlated with a poor prognosis and decreased
responsiveness to endocrine- and chemo-therapies (yamauchi
et al., 1995; colomer et al., 2000), which indicates that her2
ecd shedding actually occurs in vivo to generate her2 p95
fragments with enhanced signaling activity. likewise, pioneering
studies demonstrated that engineered deletion of her2 ecd
significantly increases the tk activity and transforming
efficiency of the resulting her2 truncated protein (di fiore
et al., 1987; segatto et al., 1988). until recently, however, the
ultimate biological and clinical meaning of her2 ecd has
remained largely unclear. ghedini et al. (2010) have revealed for
the first time that her2 ecd efficiently inhibits growth of
her2-overexpressing cancer cells by potentially promoting
her2 ecd dimerization with her2,  xxxg682xxx , and  xxxg722xxx 
transmembrane receptors. in their hands, oversecretion
of soluble her2 ecd was found to impair cross-tyrosine
phosphorylation thus leading to decreased activation of the
 xxxg682xxx  and her2 membrane-spanning receptors. since, high
circulating levels of a recombinant her2 ecd molecule were

sufficient to significantly impair her2-driven cancer growth but
not that of her2-negative cancer cells, it is conceivable that

her2 ecd shedding from full-length her2 but simultaneously
preventing formation of truncated cell membrane-bound her2
intracellular fragment (her2 icd) exhibiting undesirable
constitutive kinase activity may be extremely efficient at

lapatinib and her2 ecd

managing her2-positive cancer disease (molina et al., 2001;
scaltriti et al., 2007). moreover, since re-targeting of shed her2
ecd with full-length her receptors was found to increase the
binding sites available for the anti-her2 monoclonal antibody
trastuzumab, which potentiated trastuzumab accumulation and
activity (ghedini et al., 2010), a prediction of synergy should
be expected when combining trastuzumab with her targeting
drugs capable to enhance expression of her2 ecd. from a
clinical perspective, the latter hypothesis may be particularly
relevant because resistance of her2-overexpressing
carcinomas to trastuzumab might rely in their low-her2
proteolytic cleavage and/or high expression of constitutively
active her2 icd-like forms, with the two situations leading to a
lack of effective binding sites for trastuzumab.
in terms of total levels of full-length her2 protein, treatment
with trastuzumab as single agent is known to enhance her2 tk
activity while inducing her2 protein down-regulation.
intriguingly, scaltriti et al. (2009) have recently revealed that
lapatinib—a dual  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (tki) that targets
both egfr ( xxxg682xxx ) and her2—in addition to inhibit her2
activity (i.e., auto- and cross-tyrosine phosphorylation) also
results in a marked accumulation of inactive her2 receptors at
the cell surface of her2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.
similarly to the mono- xxxg682xxx  tki  xxxd2186xxx  (gefitinib) that was
found to interfere with her2 function by inducing formation
of inactive (unphosphorylated)  xxxg682xxx /her2 and  xxxg682xxx / xxxg722xxx 
heterodimers (anido et al., 2003), lapatinib-induced
accumulation of her2 lastly results in the stabilization of
inactive her2 homo- (her2/her2) and hetero- (her2/ xxxg682xxx 
and her2/ xxxg722xxx ) dimers (scaltriti et al., 2009). we here
propose that lapatinib, by pharmacologically augmenting her2
ecd shedding, functionally recapitulates the molecular effects
of the forced expression of her2 ecd in her2-positive cancer
cells to inhibit her2-driven cancer cell growth.
materials and methods
drugs

the egfr ( xxxg682xxx )-tki gefitinib ( xxxd2186xxx ; iressa1) was kindly
provided by astrazeneca (astrazeneca plc headquarters,
london, uk). the dual  xxxg682xxx /her2-tki1 lapatinib ( xxxd2445xxx ;
tykerb1) was kindly provided by glaxosmithkline (gsk),
corporate environment, health & safety (brentford, middlesex,
uk). stock solutions of gefitinib and lapatinib (10 mmol/l) were
prepared in dmso and stored in aliquots in the dark at 208c until
utilization. trastuzumab (herceptin1)—kindly provided by
hospital universitari de girona dr josep trueta pharmacy
(girona, spain)—was solubilized in bacteriostatic water for
injection containing 1.1% benzyl alcohol (stock solution at 21 mg/
ml), stored at 48c and used within 1 month. for experimental use,
experimental agents were prepared fresh from stock solutions and
were diluted with cell growth medium. control cells were cultured
in media containing identical concentrations (v/v) as the test cells.
vehicle solutions had no noticeable influence on the proliferation
of experimental cells.
cell lines and culture conditions

skbr3 and skov3 cancer cell lines were obtained from the
american type culture collection (atcc; manassas, va) and
they were routinely grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(dmem, gibco1 cell culture systems; invitrogen s.a., barcelona,
spain) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (fbs;
bio-whittaker, inc., walkersville, md), 1% l-glutamine, 1% sodium
pyruvate, 50 u/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. cells
were maintained at 378c in a humidified atmosphere of 95%
air/5% co2. cells were screened periodically for mycoplasma
contamination.

establishment of cancer cell populations with acquired
resistance to her2-targeted therapies

to establish skbr3 cells exhibiting secondary resistance to the
anti-her2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, trastuzumab-naive
skbr3 parental cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of
trastuzumab for a minimum of 10 months (vazquez-martin et al.,
2009). briefly, skbr3 cells were initially exposed to 20 mg/ml
trastuzumab for 3 months (four treatments weekly) followed by
185 mg/ml trastuzumab for 2 months (twice weekly). two pools
selected for further study (skbr3 tzbr pool1 and skbr3 tzbr
pool2) resisted continuous growth in the presence of 200 mg/ml
trastuzumab (cells were passaged at 70% confluence and
trastuzumab-containing media were replaced twice weakly for
a minimum of 5 months). to establish mcf-7/her2 cells with
acquired resistance to lapatinib, lapatinib-naı̈ve mcf-7/her2
parental cells were continuously exposed to lapatinib for a
minimum of 10 months before starting any experimental
procedure (vazquez-martin et al., 2008). briefly, mcf-7/her2 cells
were exposed to 5 mmol/l lapatinib for 1 month followed by
10 mmol/l lapatinib for another 2 months, and 20 mmol/l lapatinib
for 1 month. following this 4-month period, two resistant pools
(mcf-/her2 lapr pool1 and mcf-7/her2 lapr pool2) were
maintained in medium that was replaced twice weekly and cells
were passaged at 70% confluence always in the presence of
10 mmol/l lapatinib. trastuzumab-resistant and lapatinib-resistant
pools were maintained in media without drugs for at least 2 days
before each experiment.
her2-specific elisa

determination of her2 protein content in whole cell lysates and
her2 ecd concentrations in conditioned media was performed
with a commercially available quantitative her2 microtiter elisa
(human neu quantitative elisa system; oncogene science, bayer
diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. to asses
the effects of trastuzumab (100 mg/ml), gefitinib (1 mmol/l), and
lapatinib (1 mmol/l)—or their combinations, as specified—on
total her2 protein in whole cell lysates, cells were plated in 100mm tissue culture dishes and cultured in dmem with 10% fetal
bovine serum (fbs) until they reached 75–80% confluence, and
then incubated overnight in serum-free dmem. following
starvation cells were washed twice with serum-free dmem and
cultured for 48 h in low-serum (0.1% fbs) dmem in the presence
or absence of her targeting drugs, as specified. after treatment,
culture supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 1,000g,
aliquoted, and stored at 808c until testing. adhered cells were
washed twice with cold-pbs and then lysed in buffer (20 mm tris
ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 1 mm egta, 1% triton x-100,
2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm b-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm
na3vo4, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride)
for 30 min on ice. the lysates were cleared by centrifugation in an
eppendorff tube (15 min at 14,000g, 48c). protein content was
determined against a standardized control using the pierce protein
assay kit. 1:50; 1:500; 1:5,000; and 1:10,000 dilutions of total cell
lysates and conditioned medium from trastuzumab-, gefitinib- and
lapatinib-treated (or their combinations, as specified) and control
untreated cancer cells were used to quantitate total her2 protein
and her2 ecd expression. a standard curve was generated by
using standard solutions as per manufacturer’s instructions. the
concentrations of her2 in test samples (in nanograms of her2 per
milligram of total protein) were determined by interpolation of the
sample absorbances from the standard curve. each experiment was
performed in duplicate wells.

her2-specific elisa confirmed the ability of the anti-her2
monoclonal antibody trastuzumab to significantly downregulate (50% reduction) her2 protein levels (fig. 1a, left

promoted a dramatic accumulation of her2 protein (>4-fold)
relative to untreated skbr3 cells (fig. 1a). culturing skov3

lapatinib-treated and -untreated control cells were washed twice
with cold pbs and then lysed as described above. equal amounts of
protein (i.e., 50 mg) were resuspended in 5 laemli sample buffer for
10 min at 708c, subjected to electrophoresis on 3–8% nupage
tris-acetate and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. nonspecific binding on the nitrocellulose filter paper was minimized by
blocking for 1 h at room temperature (rt) with tbs-t buffer
[25 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5), 150 mm nacl, 0.05% tween 20]
containing 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk. the treated filters were
washed in tbs-t and then incubated with mouse monoclonal
antibodies against either p185her2 (ab-3 clone; oncogene research
products) or phosphory-p185her2-tyr1248 (ab-18, clone pn2a;
neomarkers, fremont, ca) for 2 h at rt in tbs-t buffer containing
1% (w/v) non-fat dry milk. the membranes were washed in tbs-t,
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (jackson
immunoresearch, west grove, pa) in tbs-t were added for 1 h,
and immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence
reagent (pierce, milwaukee, wi).
determination of synergism: isobologram analysis

the nature of the interaction between lapatinib plus trastuzumab
and lapatinib plus gefitinib was evaluated by the isobologram
technique, a dose-oriented geometric method of assessing drug
interactions (berenbaum, 1989). in the isobologram method
the concentration of one agent producing a desired (e.g., 50%
inhibitory) effect is plotted on the horizontal axis, and the
concentration of another agent producing the same degree of
effect is plotted on the vertical axis; a straight line joining these
two points represents zero interaction (addition) between two
agents. the experimental isoeffect points are the concentrations
(expressed relative to the ic50 value) of the two agents which when
combined decreased cell viability by 30%. when the experimental
isoeffect points fall below that line, the combination effect of
the two drugs is considered to be supra-additive or synergistic,
whereas antagonism occurs if the point lies above it. a quantitative
index of these interactions was provided by the isobologram
equation ci50 ¼ (a/a) þ (b/b), where, for this study, a and b
represent the respective concentrations of lapatinib and
trastuzumab or lapatinib and gefitinib required to produce a
fixed level of inhibition (ic50) when administered alone, a and b
represent the concentrations required for the same effect when
drugs were administered in simultaneous combination, and ci50
represents an index of drug interaction (combination index).
ci values of <1 indicate synergy, a value of 1 represents addition,
and values of >1 indicate antagonism. for all estimations of ci50,
we used only isoboles where intercept data for both axes were
available.

lapatinib and her2 ecd

expression by >60% whereas her2 protein accumulated by
>3-fold in response to lapatinib (fig. 1b, left part).
to visualize lapatinib-induced accumulation of her2, fixed
skbr3 and skov3 cells were permeabilized with triton x-100
for the intracellular delivery of a mouse anti-her2 monoclonal
antibody directed against the ecd of her2 (clone ab-5;
oncogene research products). trastuzumab treatment
likewise promoted loss of cell membrane-associated her2 and
somewhat increased cytosolic trafficking of vesicularassociated her2, especially in skov3 cells (fig. 1a,b, right
parts). lapatinib treatment not only increased distribution of
her2 throughout the cytoplasm but promoted further a
prominent cell-surface staining of her2 in skbr3 and skov3
cells. when we performed immunodetections using a
monoclonal c-erbb2/her2 (phosphor-specific) ab-18 (clone
pn2a)—which specifically recognizes the activated, tyrosine
phosphorylated (p-tyr1248) form of her2 (digiovanna and
stern, 1995)—a total loss of her2-associated tk activity was
observed in lapatinib-treated cells (fig. 1c, left part). these
findings, altogether, support the notion that lapatinib treatment
significantly augments the concentration of the inactive form of
her2 protein at the cell membrane of her2-overexpressing
cancer cells.
given that her2 activation occurs, at least in part, as a
consequence of proteolytic cleavage of her2 ecd (hudelist
et al., 2003) and that inhibition of basal and activated cleavage of
the her2 ecd represents a pivotal mechanism of trastuzumab
action as it prevents the production of an active
(phosphorylated) form of her2 in cancer cells (molina et al.,
2001), we speculated that lapatinib-induced accumulation of
inactive her2 might promote an exacerbated her2 ecd
shedding to the extracellular milieu. elisa-based quantitative
measurements of the concentration of her2 ecd in the
conditioned media from trastuzumab-, gefitinib-, and lapatinibtreated and untreated-control skbr3 cells revealed that her2
ecd concentration likewise decreased by 5-fold in the
presence of trastuzumab, while her2 ecd dramatically
increased by 6-fold in response to lapatinib treatment
(fig. 1c, right part). a less pronounced twofold increase in
her2 ecd was found in the supernatant of gefitinib-treated
skbr3 cells.
to challenge the prediction of ghedini et al. (2010) that
acquisition of secondary resistance to trastuzumab may relate
to the occurrence of lower levels of her2 ecd shedding in
her2-overexpressing cancer cells, we took advantage of
preclinical models of acquired resistance to trastuzumab that
were recently obtained in our laboratory by continuously
growing trastuzumab-naive skbr3 cells in the presence of
clinically relevant concentrations of trastuzumab for more than
10 months (vazquez-martin et al., 2009). elisa-based
quantitative detection of the shed her2 ecd revealed that the
conditioned medium from trastuzumab-refractory skbr3
tzbr pools contained nearly undetectable levels of soluble
her2 ecd when compared with trastuzumab-sensitive skbr3
parental cells (fig. 2a). importantly, this >65-fold reduction in
her2 ecd occurred in the absence of down-regulating effects
in the expression of total her2 protein, suggesting that lower
her2 proteolytic cleavage functionally corresponds to a lack of
effectiveness for trastuzumab. trastuzumab-refractory skbr3
tzbr pools retained an exquisite sensitivity to the growthinhibitory activity of lapatinib (the ic50 value, i.e., the
concentration of lapatinib necessary to reduce cell viability by
50%, decreased from 100 nm lapatinib in trastuzumab-sensitive
skbr3 parental cells to 20 and 15 nm lapatinib in trastuzumabrefractory tzbr pool1 and tzbr pool2, respectively).
remarkably, exacerbated sensitivity of trastuzumab-resistant
skbr3 tzbr pools to lapatinib-induced cell growth inhibition
took place when lapatinib treatment fully restored (and
increased further) the basal levels of her2 ecd shedding
journal of cellular physiology

occurring in trastuzumab-naive skbr3 parental cells (fig. 2a).
thus, lapatinib-treated skbr3 tzbr pools accumulated
>100-times soluble her2 ecd in their supernatants when
compared to control-untreated skbr3 tzbr pools. indirect
immunofluorescence with ab-5 confirmed the ability of
lapatinib to fully restore her2 ecd expression at the cell
membrane of trastuzumab-refractory skbr3 tzbr pools
(fig. 2a).
to validate further the notion that, because her2 ecd
provides effective binding sites for trastuzumab (ghedini et al.,
2010), supra-additive (i.e., synergistic) interactions should
occur when combining drugs that enhance the accumulation of
her2 ecd (e.g., lapatinib) with the her2 ecd-targeted drug
trastuzumab, we decided to monitor her2 ecd expression
levels and the nature of the interaction (i.e., antagonism,
addition, and synergism) when concurrently combining
lapatinib plus trastuzumab or lapatinib plus gefitinib in mcf-7
cells engineered to overexpress her2 (menendez et al., 2007).
likewise, trastuzumab treatment decreased her2 ecd
expression whereas lapatinib exposure drastically augmented
the occurrence of soluble her2 ecd by 4-fold in mcf-7/
her2 cells. importantly, lapatinib treatment significantly
increased the ability of trastuzumab to down-regulate her2
ecd levels (from 2-fold decrease in the absence of lapatinib to
4-fold decrease in the presence of lapatinib; fig. 2b). we failed
to observe changes in the accumulation of her2 ecd
promoted by lapatinib upon co-exposure to gefitinib. the
differential ability of her targeting drugs to alter lapatinibinduced accumulation of her2 ecd translated into a
differential ability of her targeting drugs to synergistically
interact with lapatinib. we performed a series of isobologram
transformations of multiple dose–responses analyses (a
representative transformation is presented graphically—
isobologram—in fig. 2b; the straight line drawn between
the ic50 for lapatinib and the ic50 for trastuzumab or gefitinib
indicates the alignment of theoretical isoeffect data points for
additive interactions). when the true ic50 values (i.e., the
experimental concentrations which combined produced 50%
reduction in cell viability) were plotted and compared with the
additive line, all the experimental isoeffect data points fell in the
left side of the additive line in the lapatinib-trastuzumab
combination, clearly denoting a synergistic effect. indeed, the
value of the mean combination index50 (ci50) confirmed
further that the amount of lapatinib and trastuzumab necessary
to reduce cell viability by 50% was only 0.553 times as much as it
would be required if they demonstrated purely additive actions.
conversely, additive to nearly antagonistic interactions were
observed when her2 ecd-targeted drug trastuzumab was
substituted with the mono- xxxg682xxx  tki gefitinib (ci50 ¼ 1.153).
these findings, altogether, strongly suggest that concurrent
supplementation with the dual  xxxg682xxx /her2 tki lapatinib
synergistically works to enhance the growth inhibitory activity
of the anti-her2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab likely due
to its ability to provide higher numbers of her2 ecd sites
susceptible of trastuzumab binding.
to definitely confirm that lapatinib-induced augmentation of
her2 ecd shedding is necessary for lapatinib to elicit growth
inhibitory effects against her2-overexpressing cancer cells, we
took advantage of two models of acquired resistance to
lapatinib (mcf-7/her2 lapr cells) established in our
laboratory by chronically exposing lapatinib-naive mcf-7/her2
cells to increasing concentrations of lapatinib for >10 months
(vazquez-martin et al., 2008). as occurred in cancer models
that naturally bear her2 gene amplification (e.g., skbr3 and
skov3 cell lines, fig. 1a,b), mcf-7 cells engineered to
ectopically overexpress her2 up-regulated her2 protein
levels in a statistically significant manner following exposure to
lapatinib (fig. 2c, left part). although lapatinib-resistant cells
showed slightly lower protein levels of her2 when compared

trastuzumab and lapatinib plus gefitinib was evaluated by the isobologram technique (b) as described in ‘‘materials and methods’’ section.

to lapatinib-naive mcf-7/her2 parental cells, lapr pools still
behaved as ‘‘her2 overexpressors’’ because their her2
proteins levels (700 ng of her2 per mg protein) were
comparable to those found in cancer cell lines naturally
exhibiting her2 gene-amplification and her2 proteinoverexpression (900–1,000 ng of her2 per milligram protein
in skbr3 and bt474 breast cancer cell lines). interestingly,
lapatinib re-treatment failed to up-regulate the amount of
inactive her2 protein in lapr pools (fig. 2c, left part).
perhaps, more importantly for this study, the dramatic
augmentation of her2 ecd shedding that occurred upon
treatment of mcf-7/her2 cells with lapatinib (>7-fold
increase) was fully suppressed in lapatinib-refractory lapr
pools (fig. 2c, right part). these findings, altogether, strongly
suggest that lapatinib-induced accumulation of inactive her2
protein at the cell membrane is necessary to elicit lapatinibenhanced cleavage of her2 ecd and its cell growth inhibitory
activity in her2-positive cancer cells.
discussion

our findings confirm and expand on recent findings by ghedini
et al. (2010) to indicate that therapeutic strategies aimed to
journal of cellular physiology

augment basal cleavage of her2 ecd but preventing formation
of constitutively active forms of her2 intracellular fragments
may be extremely efficient at inhibiting her2-driven cancer cell
growth. this scenario is plausible for the dual  xxxg682xxx /her2 tki
lapatinib, which works intracellularly and directly targets the tk
domain of her2. expanding into a previous discovery by
scaltriti et al. (2009), we here reveal for the first time that
lapatinib-induced stabilization and accumulation of the inactive
form of her2 protein ultimately leads to the augmentation of
her2 ecd shedding. the ability of lapatinib to enhance basal
cleavage of her2 ecd while simultaneously inhibiting her2 tk
activity and her2-driven cancer cell growth agrees with the
framework proposed by ghedini et al. (2010), where her2
ecd oversecretion can efficiently prevent auto- and crossactivation of cell membrane-associated her receptors to
decrease her2-dependent cell growth. indeed, her2 positivecancer cells failed to shed her2 ecd when exhibiting
refractoriness to the growth inhibitory effects of lapatinib. in
terms of trastuzumab efficacy, lapatinib enhanced trastuzumabbinding ecd constitutes a non-overlapping anti-her2
mechanism of action that could explain the ability of lapatinib to
synergistically potentiate trastuzumab-dependent cell
cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. in this scenario, the fact that

lapatinib and her2 ecd

lapatinib treatment efficiently restores her2 ecd shedding in
trastuzumab-refractory her2 ecd-null cancer cells may
explain also the clinical value of lapatinib against her2-positive
tumors lacking ecd effective binding sites for trastuzumab
(scaltriti et al., 2010).
although some studies have suggested that high baseline
her2 ecd positively correlates with response to trastuzumab
and that trastuzumab responsiveness correlates also with early
reduction in serum ecd, clinical evidence linking serum her2
ecd level to trastuzumab efficacy has not been consistent.
indeed, ecd utility as a predictive marker once therapy has
begun still warrants further study (reviewed in nahta et al.,
2009). supporting this notion, a recent sequential analysis of
ecd from more than 300 patients treated with six different
trastuzumab-containing treatment regimens did not support
use of her2 serum ecd as a predictor of trastuzumab
response (lennon et al., 2009). the sole study examining serum
her2 ecd and response to lapatinib failed also to find a
predictive value of baseline serum ecd with response to
lapatinib-based treatment (cameron et al., 2008). some
authors have erroneously suggested that serum her2 ecd can
bind and neutralize trastuzumab, such that the antibody cannot
bind intact full-length her2. also, the mistake of considering
high levels of her2 ecd simply as a marker of robust her2
overexpression may complicate a correct design of clinical
studies aimed to accurately describe her2 ecd as a potential
predictor of response or resistance to trastuzumab and
lapatinib. while, it is obvious that lapatinib will not interact with
serum her2 ecd, it might be reasonable to suggest that
increasing rather than declining serum her2 ecd levels might
unexpectedly associate with responses to lapatinib. in the same
manner, declines in serum her2 ecd in patients receiving
trastuzumab-based regimens could inform about the
occurrence of acquired resistance to the anti-her2 antibody
while raising levels of circulating ecd in trastuzumabrefractory patients challenged with lapatinib might
counterintuitively inform about an effective restoration of
her2 ecd shedding. in this complex scenario, it should be
mentioned that decreased trastuzumab accessibility and lack of
activation of her2 in jimt-1 (nagy et al., 2005), a her2-gene
amplified breast cancer cell line exhibiting cross-resistance to
trastuzumab and lapatinib (köninki et al., 2010; oliverasferraros et al., 2010), relates to the occurrence of extremely
low levels of her2 ecd in cell culture media and serum samples
(tanner et al., 2004). forthcoming studies should elucidate
whether dynamic changes in the expression profile of
metalloproteinases (mmps) and tissue inhibitor of mmps
(timps) may alter release of the her2 ecd to regulate her2mediated tumor growth and susceptibility to her2 inhibitors
such as trastuzumab and lapatinib.
