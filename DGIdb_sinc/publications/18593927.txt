malignant gliomas are the most common primary intrinsic
brain tumors and are highly lethal. the widespread migration
and invasion of neoplastic cells from the initial site of tumor
formation into the surrounding brain render these lesions
refractory to definitive surgical treatment.  xxxg2220xxx , a
microtubule-destabilizing protein that mediates cell cycle
progression, can also regulate directed cell movement. nitrosoureas, traditionally viewed as dna alkylating agents, can
also covalently modify proteins such as  xxxg2220xxx . we therefore
sought to establish a role for  xxxg2220xxx  in malignant glioma
cell motility, migration, and invasion and determine the
effects of nitrosoureas on these cell movement–related
processes. scratch wound–healing recovery, boyden chamber
migration, matrigel invasion, and organotypic slice invasion
assays were performed before and after the down-regulation
of cellular  xxxg2220xxx  levels and in the absence and presence of
sublethal nitrosourea ([1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea];  xxxd2502xxx ) concentrations. we show that decreases in
 xxxg2220xxx  expression lead to significant decreases in malignant
glioma cell motility, migration, and invasion.  xxxd2502xxx , at a concentration of 10 mmol/l, causes similar significant decreases,
even in the absence of any effects on cell viability. the direct
inhibition of  xxxg2220xxx  by  xxxd2502xxx  is likely a contributing factor.
these findings suggest that the inhibition of  xxxg2220xxx 
expression and function may be useful in limiting the spread
of malignant gliomas within the brain, and that nitrosoureas
may have therapeutic benefits in addition to their antiproliferative effects. [cancer res 2008;68(13):5267–72]

catastrophes and sequestering a-h tubulin dimers (3). consequently,  xxxg2220xxx  has direct effects on cellular processes such as
migration, division, and growth cone guidance by influencing the
association of microtubules with the actin cytoskeleton (4).
consistent with this,  xxxg2220xxx  has been shown to influence
sarcoma cell migration and invasion (5). nitrosoureas such as
([1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea];  xxxd2502xxx ) have previously been shown to decompose under physiologic conditions to
chloroethyl carbonium ions and reactive organic isocyanates. the
former alkylate dna and cause interstrand cross-links, whereas the
latter carbamoylate proteins on nh2-terminal amino groups and
the amino groups of lysine side chains (6).  xxxg2220xxx , which has a
high percentage of lysine residues (16%), readily undergoes ccnumediated carbamoylation with a subsequent inhibition in microtubule depolymerization activity (7). we therefore hypothesized
that  xxxd2502xxx , via its inhibitory effect on  xxxg2220xxx , could have an
inhibitory effect on tumor cell migration and invasion that is
independent of its antiproliferative activity.
to test this hypothesis, we first sought to establish a correlation
between  xxxg2220xxx  expression level and cell motility, migration, and
invasion. we then analyzed the effects of sublethal concentrations
of  xxxd2502xxx  as well as temozolomide on these cell movement–related
processes. temozolomide was examined because of its increasing
use in the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas (8). finally,
to establish a direct association between  xxxd2502xxx  and  xxxg2220xxx , we
assessed the effects of  xxxd2502xxx  on the ability of  xxxg2220xxx  to prevent
the polymerization of microtubules, a well-characterized function
of  xxxg2220xxx . the direct significance of our findings on malignant
glioma therapies is discussed.

introduction

materials and methods

although the initial treatment for many malignant gliomas is
maximal surgical resection, the widespread migration and invasion
of tumor cells into the surrounding brain tissue render a complete
removal virtually impossible. patients are therefore commonly
treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in efforts to inhibit
tumor cell proliferation and increase survival (1). the inhibition of
cell migration and invasion is, in principle, likely to prevent the
spread of tumors into eloquent brain regions and, in turn, preserve
neurologic function. clinical attempts to specifically effect such
inhibition have, however, been limited (2).
 xxxg2220xxx  regulates dynamic instability, the growth and shrinkage of microtubules, by stimulating microtubule plus end

cell culture. the u251-stmni and u251-laczi cell lines were derived as
previously described (7). briefly, parental u251 cells (american type culture
collection) were transfected with perv3 (stratagene) using the lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (invitrogen). stable transfectants, selected
on the basis of  xxxg418xxx  (invitrogen) resistance, were then transfected with
peind-rnai, which contains the hygromycin b resistance gene and either
the  xxxg2220xxx -specific short-hairpin rna (shrna) oligonucleotide sequence
5¶-agttgttgttctcttctattgccttctgattggtcagaaggcaatagaagagaacaacaact-3¶ (u251-stmni cells) or the lacz-specific shrna
oligonucleotide sequence 5¶-ctacacaaatcagcgatttcgaaaa
atcgctgatttgtgtag-3¶ (u251-laczi cells), downstream of a modified
muristerone a (mura)-responsive u6 promoter sequence. cells resistant to
both  xxxg418xxx  and hygromycin b (invitrogen) were subcloned by limiting
dilution.
cell viability assays. cells (5  104) were seeded into 24-well plates
(corning, inc.) and treated with dmso control, 10 to 30 amol/l  xxxd2502xxx 
(hnz portlink), or 10 to 30 amol/l temozolomide (drug synthesis and
chemistry branch, national cancer institute). after 3 d, cells were trypsinized and counted with a coulter particle counter (coulter electronics).
experiments were performed in sextuplicate.

in u251-stmni (a ) and u251-laczi (b) cells after treatment with increasing concentrations of mura for 72 h, which induces the transcription of  xxxg2220xxx -specific
and laczi-specific shrnas, respectively. the former causes the knockdown of  xxxg2220xxx  expression, whereas the latter serves as a control for the nonspecific effects of
mura treatment as well as the transcription of nonspecific shrnas. evaluation of h-actin expression was performed on the same blots and used as an internal
control to monitor loading and transfer of gel lanes. on the right side of each blot are molecular mass markers in kilodaltons. laser densitometric analysis of protein
bands was performed, and the ratio of  xxxg2220xxx  expression to h-actin expression (stmn:h-actin) was determined and normalized to a value of 100 for the
nonmura-treated condition. there is a quantitative decrease in  xxxg2220xxx  expression in the u251-stmni cells after treatment of cells with increasing concentrations
of mura (a ). there is no such effect of mura treatment on  xxxg2220xxx  expression in u251-laczi cells (b). c, cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of dmso
vehicle control (0 amol/l), or 10 to 30 amol/l  xxxd2502xxx  or temozolomide (tmz ), and viable cells were counted. cell counts were normalized to the number of

were performed in sextuplicate. columns, mean; bars, sd. *, drug concentrations in which the mean number of viable cells differs significantly from the mean

immunoblotting analysis. cells cultured for 72 h in the absence or
presence of increasing concentrations of mura (invitrogen), which enhances
the activity of a modified u6 promoter and results in the transcription of
downstream shrna oligonucleotide sequences, were solubilized using 1%
nonidet p-40 in tbs (sigma). whole cell extracts were resolved by sds-page
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (millipore), which
were subsequently probed with primary rabbit antistathmin (calbiochem;
1:10,000 dilution) and mouse anti–h-actin (sigma; 1:40,000 dilution)
antibodies followed by secondary alkaline phosphatase–conjugated goat
anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse igg antibodies (promega; 1:7500 dilution).
membranes were developed using ddao phosphate (invitrogen) and
scanned using an fla-5100 laser based scanner (fujifilm). image processing
including laser densitometric analysis of  xxxg2220xxx  and h-actin expression
levels was performed using multigauge version 3.0 imaging software
(fujifilm). quantitative relative  xxxg2220xxx  expression levels were determined
by measuring the quantitative light absorbance units minus background
(ql bg) for each of the  xxxg2220xxx  and h-actin bands. the ratio of
 xxxg2220xxx (ql bg) to h-actin(ql bg) was determined for each sample and
normalized to the  xxxg2220xxx (ql bg) to h-actin(ql bg) ratio for the nonmuratreated sample, which was assigned the value of 100.
scratch wound–healing recovery assays. cells cultured in the absence
or presence of 10 amol/l mura for 72 h were allowed to reach confluence. a
20-al pipette tip (thermofisher scientific) was used to scratch and create a
wound in the confluent monolayer. detached cells were immediately
removed by replacement of medium and where indicated,  xxxd2502xxx 
(10 amol/l), temozolomide (10 amol/l), or both were added. images were
subsequently captured, and then again 24 h later, using an axiocam mrm
camera, an axiovert 200 microscope, and axiovision version 4.2 software
(all zeiss). experiments were performed in triplicate.
cell migration assays. cells cultured in the absence or presence of
10 amol/l mura for 72 h were added to the upper compartments of 96-well

boyden chamber plates containing 8-am pore size polycarbonate filters
(neuro probe). after 16 h of culture in medium containing drug vehicle,
 xxxd2502xxx  (10 amol/l), temozolomide (10 amol/l), or both  xxxd2502xxx  and
temozolomide, the polycarbonate filters were removed, fixed with methanol
for 10 min, and stained with modified trypan blue stain (0.2% in pbs) for
20 min to facilitate visualization and counting of cells. cells on the upper
side of the filter were removed using a rubber scraper, and the migrated
cells on the underside of the filter were counted with the aid of a
microscope. experiments were performed in sextuplicate.
matrigel invasion assay. the polycarbonate filter of each boyden
chamber well was coated with matrigel (bd biosciences). cells cultured in
the absence or presence of 10 amol/l mura for 72 h were inoculated into
the upper chambers, and the chemoattractant rhsdf-1a/ xxxg560xxx  (pre–b-cell
growth–stimulating factor, 100ng/ml; r&d systems) was added to the
bottom chambers. after 24 h of culture in medium-containing drug vehicle,
 xxxd2502xxx  (10 amol/l), temozolomide (10 amol/l), or both  xxxd2502xxx  and temozolomide, the matrigel-coated polycarbonate filters were removed, fixed,
and stained as above. invaded cells on the underside of the filter were
counted as above. experiments were performed in sextuplicate.
glioma invasion in organotypic brain slices. brain slices were
obtained from 10-d-old nih swiss mice and cultured as previously
described (9). glioma cells incubated with dii (3h-indolium, 2-[3-(1,3dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-1-octadecyl-2h-indol-2-ylidene)-1-propenyl]-3,3-dimethyl-1-octadecyl-, perchlorate; 30 amg/ml; invitrogen) were plated onto
6-well plates at a density of 5  104cells/10 al. upside-down overnight
culture of the cell suspensions led to the formation of glioma spheroids
f0.5 mm in diameter. spheroids were picked and implanted into the
corpus callosa of the brain slices with the aid of an inverted microscope
equipped with a calibrated micromanipulator. slices were maintained
in culture medium containing no drugs,  xxxd2502xxx  (10 amol/l), mura

were performed in triplicate.
in vitro tubulin polymerization assay. tubulin polymerization assays
were performed using purified rat tubulin as described (10, 11). sixhistidine–tagged recombinant  xxxg2220xxx  (5 amol/l) was produced as
previously described (7), and when indicated, was pretreated for 6 h with
 xxxd2502xxx  (10 amol/l) followed by removal of free  xxxd2502xxx  using a zeba micro

results
 xxxg2220xxx  knockdown and  xxxd2502xxx  inhibit scratch wound
healing. to determine the effects of  xxxg2220xxx  knockdown on cell
motility, we first generated a u251 malignant glioma–derived cell
line in which mura enhances the transcription of a stathminspecific shrna and induces the knockdown of  xxxg2220xxx  expression
(u251-stmni). we also generated a control cell line in which mura
enhances the transcription of a lacz-specific shrna (u251-laczi).
the mura-induced knockdown of  xxxg2220xxx  protein expression
by u251-stmni cells is dose dependent with a 47% decrease
occurring in response to treatment with 10 amol/l for 72 hours
(fig. 1a). in contrast, treatment of u251-laczi cells with mura
concentrations as high as 20 amol/l do not have appreciable
effects on  xxxg2220xxx  expression (fig. 1b). all further experiments
involving the use of mura were carried out using a concentration
of 10 amol/l.
given the cytotoxic effects of  xxxd2502xxx  and temozolomide, we
sought to establish experimental conditions under which decreased
cell motility rather than decreased cell viability would be the
primary potential cause for decreased scratch wound healing.

treatment of cells with 10 amol/l  xxxd2502xxx  does not have a
significant effect on cell viability (p = 0.6520); however, treatment
with 20 amol/l  xxxd2502xxx  leads to a 28% decrease in cell number after
72 hours (p = 0.0100; fig. 1c). similarly, treatment of cells with
10 amol/l temozolomide does not have a significant effect on
cell viability (p = 0.5935); however, treatment with 20 amol/l
temozolomide leads to a 17% decrease in cell number after 72
hours (p = 0.0411; fig. 1c). all further experiments involving  xxxd2502xxx 
and/or temozolomide were therefore carried out using a concentration of 10 amol/l to minimize the potential confounding effect
of decreased cell viability.
u251-stmni cells treated with mura alone (fig. 2a3) show
decreased wound healing compared with nonmura-treated u251stmni cells (fig. 2a2). as controls for the effects of mura
treatment and shrna expression per se, u251-laczi cells with
(fig. 2b3) and without (fig. 2b2) mura pretreatment were also
assessed, and there seems to be no differences in wound healing.
 xxxd2502xxx  treatment alone inhibits wound healing by both u251stmni (fig. 2a4) and u251-laczi (fig. 2b4) cells, but temozolomide treatment alone does not affect either cell type (fig. 2a5 and
b5). the combination of  xxxg2220xxx  knockdown and  xxxd2502xxx  treatment
seems to be additive in inhibiting u251-stmni (fig.  xxxd577xxx ) but not
u251-laczi (fig. 2b6) cell wound healing. there is no further
decrease in wound healing in either cell type due to the addition of
temozolomide to mura or  xxxd2502xxx  (fig. 2a78, a8, b7, and b8).
 xxxg2220xxx  knockdown and  xxxd2502xxx  inhibit cell migration and
invasion. to quantitate the effects seen in the scratch wound–
healing assays, boyden chamber migration assays were performed
(fig. 3). mura induced knockdown of  xxxg2220xxx  expression in u251stmni cells causes a 32% decrease in migration (p = 0.0008),
whereas  xxxd2502xxx  treatment causes a 35% decrease (p < 0.0001).
treatment of u251-stmni cells with the combination of mura and
 xxxd2502xxx  causes a 62% decrease in migration, which is significantly
greater than that seen after treatment with the former (p = 0.0002)
or the latter (p = 0.0004) alone. in contrast, temozolomide

we also assessed the movement of tumor cells within organotypic slice preparations, a model for the in vivo invasion of tumor
cells into surrounding brain tissue. as expected, u251-stmni cell
invasion is decreased by mura,  xxxd2502xxx , and the combination of
mura and  xxxd2502xxx  (fig. 5a). u251-laczi cell invasion is also
decreased by  xxxd2502xxx , but mura treatment does not by itself seem to
have any appreciable effects nor enhance the effects of  xxxd2502xxx  in
this cell type (fig. 5b).
 xxxd2502xxx  directly inhibits  xxxg2220xxx  function.  xxxg2220xxx  prevents
microtubule polymerization by sequestering a-h tubulin dimers
(3). to determine if  xxxd2502xxx  could inhibit this  xxxg2220xxx  function,
tubulin polymerization assays were performed. the steady-state
concentration of polymerized microtubules in a tubulin-containing
solution is decreased 63% by the addition of native  xxxg2220xxx . this
 xxxg2220xxx -mediated decrease is abrogated by 59% if the  xxxg2220xxx  is
pretreated with 10 amol/l  xxxd2502xxx  (fig. 6).  xxxd2502xxx  by itself has no
significant effects on tubulin polymerization (data not shown).

u251-laczi cells (b) that had migrated through boyden chamber membranes
during the course of a 16-h incubation period were counted and normalized
to the number of migrating untreated u251-stmni and u251-laczi cells,
respectively. where indicated, cells were exposed to  xxxd2502xxx  or temozolomide
at the start of the 16-h assay period. cells treated with mura were done so for
72 h before the initiation of the assay. various treatment conditions are indicated

bars, sd. *, drug treatment conditions in which the mean number of migrating

treatment by itself has no significant effect on migration (p =
0.1092) and does not enhance the effects of mura (p = 0.6701) or
 xxxd2502xxx  (p = 0.4027) either (fig. 3a).  xxxd2502xxx  treatment of u251-laczi
cells causes a 30% decrease in migration (p = 0.0008), but mura
treatment of these cells has no significant effect when used alone
(p = 0.5960) and does not enhance the effects of  xxxd2502xxx  (p = 0.1297).
temozolomide alone also has no significant effects on the
migration of u251-laczi cells (p = 0.3839) and also does not
enhance the effects of  xxxd2502xxx  either (p = 0.1138; fig. 3b).
the movement of cells through matrigel, an in vitro model of
basement membrane invasion, was evaluated. in u251-stmni cells,
mura-induced  xxxg2220xxx  knockdown inhibits invasion by 49%
(p < 0.0001), whereas  xxxd2502xxx  treatment does so by 50% (p < 0.0001).
the combination of the two inhibits invasion by 70% (p < 0.0001),
which is significantly greater than that seen in response to either
 xxxg2220xxx  knockdown (p = 0.0013) or  xxxd2502xxx  treatment (p = 0.0014)
alone (fig. 4a).  xxxd2502xxx  treatment of u251-laczi cells causes a 40%
decrease in invasion (p = 0.0003), but mura treatment of these cells
has no significant effects (p = 0.0756; fig. 4b). again, temozolomide
has no effects by itself and does not enhance the effects of either
mura treatment or  xxxd2502xxx  treatment in either u251-stmni or
u251-laczi cells (all p > 0.0821; fig. 4a and b).

additive. b, in contrast, mura treatment of u251-laczi cells
did not have any appreciable effects on the invasion of
cells into surrounding tissues.  xxxd2502xxx  treatment did,
however, inhibit the invasion of u251-laczi cells. mura
treatment did not augment the inhibitory effects of  xxxd2502xxx 
on u251-laczi cell invasion. white arrows, extent of tumor

morbidity. although most malignant glioma therapies are intended
to be cytostatic or cytotoxic, therapies intended to inhibit tumor
cell migration and invasion are also likely to be beneficial. with this
in mind, we investigated the roles and interactions of  xxxg2220xxx  and
 xxxd2502xxx  in the directed movements of malignant glioma cells. the
results presented above show that both decreases in  xxxg2220xxx 
expression and treatment with  xxxd2502xxx  can inhibit the migration and
invasion of malignant glioma cells. the concentration of  xxxd2502xxx 
used throughout these studies (10 amol/l) was specifically selected
because it has no significant effects on cell survival and thereby
minimizes decreased cell viability per se as a potential confounding
effect on cell motility related functions. ten amol/l is also the
approximate mean peak plasma concentration achieved in patients
after p.o. administration of  xxxd2502xxx  at a dose of 15 mg/kg (12).
a plausible mechanism by which  xxxd2502xxx  can retard migration
and invasion is through the direct inhibition of  xxxg2220xxx  function
as shown in the tubulin polymerization assay. consistent with this
model, temozolomide, an imidazotetrazine dna  xxxd3249xxx 
with no direct effects on  xxxg2220xxx  function (7), has no effects on
cell migration or invasion. temozolomide also does not act to
enhance the inhibitory effects of  xxxg2220xxx  knockdown or  xxxd2502xxx 
treatment on these cell movement related functions.
the median survival of malignant glioma patients treated with
radiotherapy plus temozolomide has been shown to be significantly
greater than that of patients treated with radiotherapy alone
(p < 0.001; ref. 13). in contrast, the addition of nitrosoureas to
radiotherapy has not been shown to provide a significant overall
survival benefit (p = 0.108; ref. 1). one implication of these two
studies is that temozolomide is more effective than nitrosoureas
in inducing lethal dna cross links in proliferating tumor cells.
although this is likely the case, our results indicate that nitrosoureas are superior to temozolomide in inhibiting tumor cell
motility. a possible therapeutic strategy would then be radiotherapy plus the combination of temozolomide and a nitrosourea,
the former to control proliferation and the latter to control
invasion.
in a recent phase ii clinical trial of radiotherapy and temozolomide plus  xxxd2502xxx , malignant glioma patients whose tumors had
promoter methylation of the o6-methylguanine-dna methyltrans-

ferase (mgmt) gene had a median progression-free survival of
19 months (14). in a phase iii clinical trial of patients also with
mgmt promoter methylated tumors, the median progression-free
survival after radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment was 10.3
months (13). the almost 2-fold increase in progression-free survival
with the addition of  xxxd2502xxx  is consistent with a model in which
progression is due to a variable combination of local and/or
distant tumor recurrence defined as expanding and/or new areas,
respectively, of contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance
imaging. the latter requires the movement of tumor cells away
from the original tumor site. due to its inhibitory effects on
migration and invasion,  xxxd2502xxx  may delay this infiltration of tumor
cells into surrounding brain tissues and, consequently, the
appearance of new areas of contrast enhancement. when eloquent
brain regions are spared, there may also be a delay in the
deterioration of neurologic function. a phase iii clinical trial

figure 6. tubulin polymerization assay. the polymerization of tubulin into
microtubules was initiated by warming a tubulin-containing solution from 0jc to
37jc. the polymerization reaction was carried out in the absence of  xxxg2220xxx 
(0 ), the presence of native unmodified  xxxg2220xxx  (stmn ), or the presence of
10 amol/l  xxxd2502xxx -pretreated  xxxg2220xxx  (stmn +  xxxd2502xxx  ). the concentration of
polymerized microtubules present in the solution was monitored over time
(x axis) for up to 120 min by determining the absorbance (y axis) at 340 nm in a
temperature-controlled 96-well microplate spectrophotometer. unmodified
 xxxg2220xxx  inhibits microtubule formation but modification of  xxxg2220xxx  by 10 amol/l
 xxxd2502xxx  abrogates this inhibition. experiments were performed in triplicate and
representative results are shown.

assessing the addition of nitrosoureas to radiotherapy and
temozolomide should therefore be considered, given our experimental data and the promising results of the phase ii clinical trial
described above.
