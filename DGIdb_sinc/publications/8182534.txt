cholecystokinin-related peptides, after systemic or central administration, prevent carbon monoxide-induced amnesia in mice.  the neuroprotective actions of cholecystokinin (cck) peptides were investigated in a mouse hypoxia model, in which the animals were successively exposed to co gas. working memory impairment 5 days after co exposure was examined by using a y-maze test; delayed amnesia was examined 7 days after co exposure, by using a step-down type passive avoidance test.  xxxd464xxx  (1-100 micrograms/kg, given s.c. 30 min before co exposure) significantly prevented the co-induced impairment of performance in both tests, the improvement being correlated with the severity of hypoxia. this severity was increased by maintaining the body temperature at 38 degrees c.  xxxd464xxx  was less effective when injected immediately after a single co exposure. the order of potency of the cck-peptides administered systemically was:  xxxd464xxx  > cck-8s > cck-8ns >> cck-4.  xxxd464xxx  (0.03-0.3 micrograms/mouse) and cck-8s (0.03-1 microgram/mouse) prevented co-induced amnesia after i.c.v. administration. under all experimental conditions, dizocilpine [mk-801, (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate, 500 micrograms/kg s.c. or 10 micrograms/mouse i.c.v.] prevented completely the co-induced amnesia. the protective effects of systemic  xxxd464xxx  were blocked, partially but significantly, by the preadministration of l-364,718 (3s-(-)-n-[2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-s-phenyl-1h-1,4- benzodiazepine-3-yl]-1h-indole-2-carboxamide, 1-10 mg/kg i.p.), a selective  xxxg352xxx  receptor antagonist. l-365,260 ([3r-(+)-2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1h-1,4-benzodiazepine-3-yl] -n' - [3-methyl-phenyl]urea), a  xxxg353xxx  antagonist, also decreased  xxxd464xxx -induced protection.(abstract truncated at 250 words).
