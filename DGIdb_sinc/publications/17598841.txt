abstract
we observed a patient with x-linked  xxxg1176xxx  (x-scid) with omenn syndromelike manifestations. x-linked inheritance, absence of  xxxg1176xxx  expression and impaired response to interleukin-2 (il-2) indicated that the case is typical of x-scid due to cc defect. however, this case was unusual
in that circulating natural killer (nk) cells were increased and nearly half of these nk cells exhibited the
cd56bright cd16) phenotype. a missense mutation was found within exon 5 of the  xxxg1176xxx  gene. the identical mutation was detected within nk, cd4+ t and b cells. engraftment of maternally derived nk cells or
gene reversion was ruled out. the erythroderma-like skin lesion was characterized by infiltration of the dermis by cd56bright nk cells admixed with  xxxg376xxx + dendritic cells (dc). expression of mrna for inflammatory
cytokines was significantly enhanced within the skin. this may be the first human case to demonstrate
that close cell-to-cell contact between dc and nk cells provides an effective alternative pathway for nk
cell differentiation ⁄ activation in vivo.

the common gamma chain (cc;  xxxg1176xxx ) plays critical
roles in lymphocyte development and activation as co-receptors for various cytokines (1). the development and
growth of t and natural killer (nk) cells depend on
interleukin-2 (il-2), il-4,  xxxg1183xxx , il-15 and il-21, all of
which transduce signals through receptors that share cc
as a common component. x-linked severe combined
immunodeﬁciency (x-scid) is caused by an  xxxg1176xxx  gene
mutation and defective cc. therefore, the t) nk) phenotype serves as a hallmark of x-scid (2). on the other
hand, there have been case reports of x-scid with
detectable nk or t cells. however, most of these cases
occur due to the engraftment and expansion of maternally transferred cells (3, 4) or are the result of rare
splicing variants of the mutated genes (5, 6).

in this report, we describe an x-scid patient with a
common  xxxg1176xxx  gene mutation, who presented with
unusual proliferation of nk cells. massive nk-cell inﬁltration within the dermis resulted in severe inﬂammation
of the skin. this case represents the ﬁrst report to
support the view that nk cells may expand in vivo independent of cc and its downstream activation mechanism.

respiratory symptoms, growth failure, and failing general conditions were evident at 6 months of age. laboratory examination revealed marked leukocytosis
(24 700 ⁄ ll) with eosinophilia (63%) and extremely low
immunoglobulins (igg, 9 mg ⁄ dl; igm, 13 mg ⁄ dl; iga,
8 mg ⁄ dl; and ige, 1.4 iu ⁄ l). all these features were
reminiscent of omenn syndrome. the patient’s maternal
uncle had died during infancy of ‘immunodeﬁciency’
(fig. 1a). among six brothers of the maternal grandmother, two had also died during infancy. the patient’s
half-brother had omenn syndrome and died after bone
marrow transplantation.
cell isolation

peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and granulocytes were prepared from venous blood. monocytes
and lymphocyte subpopulations were puriﬁed by positive
selection from pbmcs using monoclonal antibody
(mab)-coated magnetic beads (bdtm imag; bd pharmingen, san diego, ca, usa). skin-inﬁltrating lymphocytes were isolated by dispersing the skin into small

pieces, followed by passing the cells through a metal
strainer. the cell suspension was further passed through
a nylon-mesh ﬁlter to remove clumps of dead cells.
approval for the study was obtained from the human
research committee of kanazawa university graduate
school of medical science, and informed consent was
provided according to the declaration of helsinki.
flow cytometry

circulating lymphocyte subpopulations or skin-inﬁltrating lymphocytes were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry
(fcm), using appropriate ﬂuorescence-conjugated mouse
monoclonal antibodies purchased from bd pharmingen
and beckman coulter (tokyo, japan). isotype-matched
control antibodies were used as negative controls.
cell culture

peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the patient and
controls were cultured for 48 h alone, or in the presence
of 100 u ⁄ ml recombinant il-2 (shionogi & co. ltd,

osaka, japan). cd56+ nk cells were gated and cd69
expression was determined by ﬂow cytometry. the
increase of mean ﬂuorescence intensity (mfi) from baseline was expressed as dmfi.
gene mutation and microsatellite polymorphism

 xxxg1176xxx  gene mutation analysis was performed as described previously. microsatellite polymorphic markers,
including d9s1198 and cw2, were ampliﬁed with famlabeled speciﬁc primers (7, 8).
immunohistochemistry

frozen sections of skin from the patient and a control
subject were ﬁxed with cold acetone and stained with
combinations of phycoerythrin (pe)-conjugated anticd1a (bd pharmingen), ﬂourescein isothiocyanate
(fitc)-conjugated anti-cd56 (bd pharmingen) and
4¢,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dilactate (dapi) (molecular probes inc., eugene, or, usa).
expression of inflammatory cytokines

expression of mrna for various inﬂammatory cytokines
was compared between skin samples of the patient and
the control. messenger rna from the frozen sections
was reverse transcribed into cdna and polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) reactions were performed for b-actin,
il-2, interferon-c (ifn-c), il-10, il-12 and il-15.
results and discussion

the family history strongly indicated that the patient
was suffering from x-linked immunodeﬁciency (fig. 1a).
fcm analysis revealed very low, but detectable numbers
of cd4+ t cells (11.9%), markedly increased nk cells
(59.5%), and barely detectable cd8+ t cells (0.3%)
(fig. 1b). half of the nk cells (28.5%) were of the
cd56bright cd16) phenotype.
 xxxg1176xxx  was absent in every lymphocyte subpopulation
(fig. 1c). accordingly, the nk cells isolated from the
patient did not respond to ril-2 stimulation (cd69:
dmfi = 10.3), whereas nk cells from two control subjects responded normally (dmfi = 724.5 and 387.2).
 xxxg1176xxx  gene mutation analysis revealed a missense mutation within exon 5 (691g ﬁ a, r226h) in  xxxg375xxx +,
cd56+ and cd4+ lymphocytes, in addition to granulocytes (fig. 1d). microsatellite polymorphism analysis
showed identical patterns for each lymphocyte subpopulation (fig. 1e). we analyzed  xxxg1176xxx  mrna sequences
and found the identical mutation within exon 5 in the
cell population. furthermore, no unusual splice mutation
was found.

expansion of cd56bright cd16) nk cell in x-scid

it has been reported that scid with maternal t-cell
engraftment results in circulating t cells with severe skin
inﬂammation (9, 10). however, it is unlikely that the
proliferating nk cells were maternal in origin, because
the allelic patterns were identical with granulocytes and
were distinct from the maternal patterns, as shown by
microsatellite polymorphism analysis. gene reversion has
been reported in an increasing number of primary immunodeﬁciency patients, in addition to numerous other
inherited disorders (11, 12). our own experience showed
that second-site mutations lead to expansion of oligoclonal t cells and resulted in omenn-like skin inﬂammation in an scid patient (13). we were also able to rule
out the possibility that the corrective reversion occurred
at the mutated sequence of the  xxxg1176xxx  gene in this particular patient, because the identical missense mutation
was detected within exon 5 in all cell populations, including nk cells. finally, unusual splice-site mutation of
the  xxxg1176xxx  gene may result in a productive splicing event
in limited numbers of nk cells (14). there was no
unusual splicing of the mrna, which may lead to the
transcription of functional  xxxg1176xxx  mrna. therefore,
none of these mechanisms are likely responsible for the
unusual nk cell expansion seen in our patient. it was
suggested that the cc-deﬁcient nk cells expanded via a
cc-independent mechanism.
we then examined the relevance of the characteristic
skin inﬂammation to the abnormal nk-cell activation
and proliferation. generalized severe erythema and
marked thickening of the skin were apparent (fig. 2a).
flow cytometric analysis of the dispersed skin tissue
revealed that the majority of the inﬁltrating lymphocytes
were cd56bright cd16) nk cells (fig. 2b). the skininﬁltrating cells expressed elevated levels of mrna for
various inﬂammatory cytokines, including il-2, ifnc,
il-10, il-12 and il-15 (fig. 2c). immunoﬂuorescence
analysis revealed that cd56+ nk cells proliferated
within the dermis and numerous  xxxg376xxx + dendritic cells
(dc) were present, forming intimate contact with nk
cells (fig. 2d). these features are in marked contrast to
normal skin, in which nk cells were virtually absent.
recently, there has been increasing understanding of
the interaction between dc and nk cells. dcs activate
nk cells directly and induce ifn-c production in vitro
(15–19). between the two distinct subpopulations of
human nk cells, cd56bright cd16) nk cells respond
directly to dc-derived il-12 and produce ifn-c, independent of the signals transduced via il-2 or il-15 (20,
21). it is possible that intimate dc–nk cell interaction
within tissues, including the skin, resulted in massive
nk-cell activation and proliferation. consequently,
vigorous production of inﬂammatory cytokines by
dc and inﬁltrating lymphocytes induced severe skin

inﬂammation, as seen in psoriasis and severe atopic

however, we do not know what triggered the unusual
interaction between dc and nk cells in this particular
patient. an identical  xxxg1176xxx  gene mutation has apparently been reported in many x-scid patients and they
usually present as typical x-scid and do not exhibit
nk cell proliferation (24). sporadic cases of x-scid
patients with increased proportions of circulating nk
cells have been reported previously (24, 25). however,
these cases are rare and the precise mechanisms of the
nk cell expansion are unknown. whether the present
case is another very rare incidental case, or the result
of a second abnormality shared between this patient
and his half-brother remains unknown. in either case, it
is demonstrated here that nk cells expand in vivo in
the absence of functional cc, indicating the presence
of a surrogate pathway for nk cell activation and
proliferation.
