introduction: endothelin receptor antagonism has become an important component in the treatment of
pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) associated with connective tissue disease (ctd). the purpose of this
study was to analyse the safety and effectiveness of  xxxd3207xxx , a selective antagonist of the  xxxg676xxx , in a
cohort of patients with pah and ctd. short-term clinical and haemodynamic effects and longer-term followup data are presented.
methods: a post hoc subgroup analysis was performed on 42 patients who had pah associated with ctd,
out of a group of 178 patients enrolled in a 12-week, double-blind, randomised clinical trial of  xxxd3207xxx 
versus placebo. data from 33 patients assigned to  xxxd3207xxx  100 mg or 300 mg daily were pooled and
compared with nine placebo-treated patients. there were 41 patients entered into the blinded extension
study, in which all patients received either 100 mg or 300 mg  xxxd3207xxx  once daily.
results: patients treated with  xxxd3207xxx  had a mean (sd) increase in 6 minute walk distance of 20 (5) m
from baseline to week 12 (p = 0.037), whereas the placebo group had a decrease of 38 (84) m, resulting in a
placebo-subtracted treatment effect of 58 m (p = 0.027). parallel improvements in quality of life and
haemodynamics were also observed. no patient discontinued their drug during the 12-week trial. in the
blinded extension study (median treatment duration 26 weeks), more patients were in functional class i–ii than
in iii–iv (p,0.001) at the end of the study compared with the start of active therapy. elevation of hepatic
transaminase levels occurred in two patients.
conclusions:  xxxd3207xxx  appears to be efficacious in patients with pah associated with ctd.

ulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is an increasingly
recognised complication of connective tissue diseases
(ctd). the prevalence of echocardiographic evidence of
pulmonary hypertension has been estimated to be as high as
27% among patients with systemic sclerosis (ssc, scleroderma)1
and 12% in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle).2
approximately 10–15% of patients with ssc have pah. in the
absence of effective treatment, rapid progression occurs,
resulting in right heart failure; survival beyond 5 years is
rare.3 4 currently available therapies for pah have had variable
short-term efficacy in the ctd population,5–9 with long-term
outcomes less than ideal.6 10 11 despite aggressive treatment, 3year survival rate in ssc-related pah is ,50%.12 13 thus, there is
an urgent need for more effective treatment regimens.
the endothelial injury characteristic of the pulmonary
vasculopathy of the ctd is associated with increased levels in
both plasma and tissues of the vasoconstrictor peptide,
endothelin.14 endothelin receptor antagonism has emerged as
an important component of pah therapy.15 two distinct
endothelin (et) receptor isoforms have been identified; type
a (eta) and type b (etb). the  xxxg676xxx  is located primarily
on vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.
activation of eta and etb receptors on pulmonary vascular
smooth muscle cells facilitates vasoconstriction and stimulates
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. etb receptors are
located primarily on endothelial cells and facilitate vasodilation
via release of vasodilators such as  xxxd2738xxx  and prostacyclin.16 etb receptors are also thought to be involved in the
clearance of et-1, particularly in the vascular beds of the lung

and kidney. treatment with  xxxd358xxx , an eta/ xxxg677xxx 
antagonist, has led to improvements in clinical outcomes in
pah patients overall,17 18 although the efficacy appears less
robust in ctd-related pah.6 9 10
selective eta antagonism is hypothesised to offer an
advantage over eta/ xxxg677xxx  blockade, by allowing
endothelial cell  xxxg677xxx  release of the vasodilators nitric
oxide (no) and prostacyclin, and clearance of et-1, while
suppressing the vasoconstrictor and proliferative actions of the
 xxxg676xxx .19  xxxd3207xxx , a selective eta antagonist,
improved 6-minute walk distance (6mwd), new york heart
association (nyha) functional class and haemodynamics in
patients enrolled in the  xxxd3207xxx  to relieve impaired
exercise (stride-1) trial, a 12-week, multicentre, doubleblind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial for pah.20 we report
the effects of  xxxd3207xxx  among the subset of patients with
pah related to ctd enrolled in this trial.

methods
the methods of stride-1 have been previously described.20 in
brief, this trial enrolled patients aged 16–75 years who had
symptomatic pah despite conventional therapy if they met the
following criteria: (1) symptomatic pah that was idiopathic,
related to ctd or related to congenital systemic pulmonary
shunts; (2) peak oxygen uptake of 25–75% of predicted value;
and (3) mean pulmonary artery pressure (mpap) >25 mmhg,
mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (pcwpm)
(15 mmhg and pulmonary vascular resistance (pvr) >240
dynes/sec/cm5. exclusion criteria included portal hypertension,
hiv infection, chronic liver disease or hepatic transaminase
levels .1.5 times the upper limit of normal (uln), chronic
renal insufficiency and significant parenchymal lung disease.
the latter was defined as a total lung capacity (tlc) of ,60% of
predicted value (or tlc 60–70% of predicted value with more
than mild interstitial changes using high-resolution ct of the
chest) or a forced expiratory volume in 1 s of ,50% of predicted
value. prior or concomitant therapy with another endothelin
receptor antagonist, a prostacyclin analogue or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor was not permitted. the protocol and informedconsent documents were approved after local institutional
review at each of the 18 participating centres (17 in the us and
1 in canada). all patients provided written informed consent
(and assent if applicable) prior to enrolment.
connective tissue disease subgroup
in stride-1, 178 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to
receive either placebo (n = 60) or  xxxd3207xxx  at an oral dose of

table 1

either 100 mg (n = 55) or 300 mg (n = 63) once daily for
12 weeks. of these patients, 42 (24%) had ctd classified as
scleroderma (limited or diffuse), sle, mixed connective tissue
disease (mctd) or overlap syndrome: 9 were on placebo, 16 on
 xxxd3207xxx  100 mg and 17 on  xxxd3207xxx  300 mg. the primary
outcome measure was the change in peak oxygen uptake on
cycle ergometry. this endpoint was not met for the entire pah
cohort20 and was not analysed separately in this ctd subset.
the secondary endpoints of change in 6mwd, nyha functional
class, quality of life (as measured by the medical outcomes
study short form (sf)-36 questionnaire)21 and haemodynamics
from baseline to week 12 were included in this analysis.
open-label extension phase
subjects completing the 12-week, double-blind, randomised,
placebo-controlled trial were eligible to participate in the
blinded extension phase (stride-1x), in which all subjects
received active  xxxd3207xxx . all patients randomised to 100 mg
or 300 mg  xxxd3207xxx  in stride-1 continued with their
assigned dosage. eight of the nine placebo patients in
stride-1 were equally randomised to either  xxxd3207xxx 
100 mg or 300 mg. all patients remained blinded to their
doses. in total, 20 patients with ctd received  xxxd3207xxx 
100 mg and 21 received 300 mg. change in functional class and
safety and tolerability measures were assessed from the first
day of active therapy to the study endpoint. stride-1x was
terminated prematurely because of the occurrence of two cases
of acute hepatoxicity, which were subsequently identified, after
the database was locked, as restricted to the 300 mg group;

 xxxd3207xxx  for pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective-tissue disease

neither subject had ctd. the 41 patients with ctd had a mean
and median exposure to  xxxd3207xxx  of 26 weeks (range
13 days to 56 weeks).
statistical analyses
continuous data are presented as mean (sd) and categorical
data as n (%). all 42 patients received the treatment to which
they were randomly assigned. because treatment effects of
 xxxd3207xxx  100 mg and 300 mg (versus placebo) on 6mwd,
nyha functional class and haemodynamic endpoints were
similar in the entire stride-1 cohort and the ctd subset, the
two  xxxd3207xxx  dosage groups were pooled in this post hoc
subgroup analysis. changes in 6mwd and other continuous
variables (sf-36 and haemodynamics) from baseline to week
12 were compared between treatment groups using analysis of
covariance models adjusted for baseline value (covariate).
changes in nyha functional class were compared between
treatment groups using the cochran–mantel–haenszel method
adjusted for baseline value. all statistical tests were two-sided
and significance set at p,0.05; p values were not adjusted for
multiple comparisons. upon completion of the stride-1x
study, for analysis of change in nyha functional class, data
was imputed using the last observation carried forward method
for patients who discontinued prematurely. patients who died
during the study were given the worst functional class at end of
study (class iv). functional class at end of study was compared
with baseline using the mcnemar test. statistical analyses were
conducted using the sas 8.2 statistical package (sas institute,
cary, north carolina, usa).

efficacy of  xxxd3207xxx 

six-minute walk distance and pulmonary
haemodynamics
all patients with ctd completed the 12-week randomised
stride-1 study. the placebo group (n = 9) had a mean (sd)
decrease in 6mwd of 38 (84) m from baseline to week 12. in
contrast, patients treated with  xxxd3207xxx  (n = 33) had an
increase from baseline of 20 (52) m (p = 0.037) with a placebosubtracted treatment effect of 58 m (p = 0.027). in addition,
 xxxd3207xxx  therapy was associated with significant improvements compared with placebo in mean right atrial pressure
(mrap), cardiac index (ci) and pulmonary vascular resistance
(pvr) (fig 1).

nyha functional class
in the 12-week stride-1 study, 8 (24%) patients with ctd
improved by one nyha functional class with  xxxd3207xxx 
compared with one (11%) control given placebo (p = 0.14). one
patient treated with placebo, but none of the patients treated
with  xxxd3207xxx , had deterioration in functional class. in the
extension study, 16 (39%) of 41 patients had an improvement
of at least 1 nyha functional class by the end of the study
compared with the start of active  xxxd3207xxx  therapy, whereas
only 2 patients had a deterioration in nyha functional class,
both of whom died. before the start of active  xxxd3207xxx 
therapy, 12 (29%) patients were nyha functional class i–ii and
29 (71%) were class iii–iv. by the end of the extension study,
26 (63%) were class i–ii and 15 (37%) were class iii–iv
(p,0.001 vs start of active therapy) (fig 2).

treated with  xxxd3207xxx  were similar, with the exception of a
non-significantly increased 6mwd in the placebo-treated group
(p = 0.063) vs the active  xxxd3207xxx -treated group.

significant improvements in the domains of physical functioning and role physical of the sf-36 were observed in the patients
treated with  xxxd3207xxx  compared with those treated with
placebo during the 12-week randomised stride-1 trial
(table 2). no significant differences were noted in the other
domains.

treated with  xxxd3207xxx  compared with 16% of the placebo
group. deterioration in nyha class occurred in 2% of ipah
patients treated with  xxxd3207xxx  versus 8% of the placebo
group. quality of life testing in the ipah subset revealed an
improvement in the physical functioning domain (change from
baseline to 12 weeks +3.77 (7.6) vs 20.1 (7.7) for the ipah
 xxxd3207xxx  and placebo groups, respectively; p,0.01).

safety
 xxxd3207xxx  appeared to be well tolerated; no patient with pah
and ctd discontinued treatment during the 12-week stride-1
trial. adverse events occurring more frequently in the  xxxd3207xxx  group than in the placebo group included peripheral
oedema, nasopharyngitis, headache and nasal congestion.
there were no increases in hepatic transaminases .36uln in
the 12-week stride-1. two cases (5%) occurred during the
extension phase. one patient in the 100 mg group had hepatic
transaminase rises of 3–56uln, which normalised after
temporarily halting the drug; recommencement of  xxxd3207xxx 
did not result in reoccurrence of elevated hepatic transaminase
levels. the second patient in the 300 mg group had hepatic
transaminase rises .56uln, which normalised after discontinuation of  xxxd3207xxx ; rechallenge was not performed.

end of study (median follow-up 26 weeks) in patients with pah related to
ctd receiving  xxxd3207xxx  100 mg or 300 mg orally once daily (last
observation carried forward at end of study).

comparison with the idiopathic pulmonary arterial
hypertension subset
the efficacy of  xxxd3207xxx  in the ctd population was
comparable with that observed in the 94 patients with
idiopathic pah (pooled  xxxd3207xxx  100 mg and 300 mg
groups, n = 57; placebo, n = 37). no significant differences
between the pah plus ctd cohort treated with  xxxd3207xxx  and
the ipah cohort treated with  xxxd3207xxx  were observed in any
of the efficacy parameters from baseline to week 12. the
placebo-subtracted treatment effect in 6mwd from baseline to
week 12 in stride-1 for the ipah cohort was +34 m
( xxxd3207xxx  group +24 (68) m vs placebo group –10 (65) m;
p = 0.02). treatment effects in haemodynamic parameters for
the ipah cohort were also of similar magnitude to the ctd
group, with mean placebo-subtracted treatment changes in
mpap of 25 mmhg (p = 0.01 vs ipah placebo group), ci of
+0.49 l/min/m2 (p,0.001) and pvr of 2311 dyne/sec/cm5
(p,0.001). functional class improved in 32% of ipah patients

five subjects discontinued  xxxd3207xxx  during the extension
phase before the study was stopped. one stopped because of
liver function abnormalities (in the 300 mg arm). one patient
had worsening pah after beginning new chronic pah therapy
and another discontinued because of an adverse event reported
as worsening dyspnoea, nausea and blurred vision. in both
cases, nyha functional class was class iii at baseline and at
end of study. two deaths occurred: one due to acute myocardial
infarction and the second associated with infection and acute
hypoxaemic respiratory failure. both subjects had been
assigned to the 100 mg  xxxd3207xxx  group in stride-1 and
both died 19 weeks from stride-1 baseline. in neither case
was the death considered by the clinical investigator to be
related to  xxxd3207xxx .

discussion
in this post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with pah
associated with ctd who were enrolled in the 12-week
stride-1 multicentre, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial,  xxxd3207xxx  therapy improved exercise capacity (as
assessed by 6mwd test), haemodynamics and physical health
domains of a quality of life instrument compared with patients
treated with placebo treated. these treatment effects were of

 xxxd3207xxx  for pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective-tissue disease

similar magnitude to those occurring in the subset of ipah
patients. improvements in nyha functional class were
observed during a median follow-up period of 26 weeks.
given the well-recognised prognostic impact of functional
class, 6mwd and haemodynamics in response to pah
therapy,22 23 selective eta antagonism with  xxxd3207xxx  may
represent an important treatment option in the management of
pah associated with ctd.
the gains in physical health-related quality of life demonstrated in the  xxxd3207xxx -treated patients with ctd are also
worth noting. this group of patients has been shown to have
significantly lower physical health-related quality of life
compared with ipah.24
 xxxd3207xxx  treatment was generally well tolerated, with a
5% incidence of hepatic transaminase elevation and a low
discontinuation rate. however, conclusions regarding safety
cannot be made on the basis of this small retrospective subset
analysis. a subsequent 18-week trial has confirmed a low
incidence of transaminase elevation with the 100 mg/day dose25
and preliminary data from a 1-year extension of this study
support the long-term safety of this dosage in patients with
pah and ctd.26
despite the beneficial effects noted in short-term (12–
16 weeks) randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, long-term outcomes with any therapy for pah
associated with ctd have been disappointing, with less efficacy
and reduced survival compared with ipah patients.10 11 27 28
although the medium-term improvement in functional class
reported here with  xxxd3207xxx  is encouraging, more patients
with longer follow-up are needed to adequately gauge the longterm efficacy of  xxxd3207xxx  in pah-ctd.
these data are comparable with a similar analysis of the eta/
 xxxg677xxx  antagonist,  xxxd358xxx , in pah associated with
ctd.6 after 12–16 weeks, there was a trend towards an
improvement in 6mwd in 44 patients treated with  xxxd358xxx 
(+19.5 m, 95% confidence interval (ci) 23.2 to 42.2]) whereas
22 subjects receiving placebo had no change (22.6 m, 95% ci
254.0 to 48.7). the placebo-subtracted treatment effect of
22.1 m was not significant. of 40 patients who remained on
 xxxd358xxx  monotherapy in an open-label long-term extension
phase, 10 experienced an improvement in nyha functional
class, and 6mwd increased by +14.7 m (95% ci –11 to 40).
nevertheless, survival in the entire cohort of 64 patients
receiving  xxxd358xxx  for a mean (sd) duration of 1.8 (0.8) years
(86% at 1 year; 74% at 2 years) was notably better than
historical controls. this was consistent with the experience
from the royal free hospital registry, which found that
patients treated with  xxxd358xxx  had a 1-year and 2-year survival
rate of 81% and 71%, respectively.29
the present findings with  xxxd3207xxx  and those available for
 xxxd358xxx  suggest that et receptor antagonism, either selective
eta or non-selective eta/etb, appears to have durable effects
on overall patient status and survival. these data are in stark
contrast with several studies of continuous intravenous
epoprostenol, in which a survival benefit has been lacking.11 12 28
the sustained disease-modifying effects of et receptor antagonism may be underestimated by short-term effects on exercise
capacity.
limitations
there were several limitations to this study. this was a post hoc
analysis of the subset of pah patients with ctd from the
stride-1/1x trials. the primary outcome measure of this trial,
maximum oxygen consumption, was not met. this parameter
has not been validated in therapeutic trials and may be less
responsive than the 6mwd. the latter has been the primary
endpoint for all other clinical trials in pah.20 our sample size

1471

was limited and data from the two dosage groups of
 xxxd3207xxx  were pooled. additional studies are needed to
further explore the efficacy of  xxxd3207xxx  in this challenging
subset of pah patients. the type of ctd was not homogenous;
it included both the scleroderma spectrum of disease5 and sle.
the natural history of pah associated with sle is not well
characterised, but a large proportion of these cases often has
concomitant features of systemic sclerosis.30 the 6mwd data
were not collected during the extension phase, thus it is not
known if the medium-term benefit in nyha class is accompanied by sustained improvements in exercise capacity.
furthermore, changes in functional class during the extension
phase must be interpreted with caution, as all subjects were on
the active drug.

conclusion
in summary, treatment with the oral eta-selective antagonist,
 xxxd3207xxx , given once daily, improved exercise capacity
(assessed by the 6mwd test), functional class, physical
health-related quality of life and haemodynamics in patients
with pah associated with ctd, and had a low incidence of
acute hepatotoxicity.  xxxd3207xxx  may prove useful in the longterm management of these patients. further studies are
warranted.
