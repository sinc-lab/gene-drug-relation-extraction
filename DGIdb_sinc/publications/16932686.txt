t-cell-targeted therapies in rheumatoid arthritis
cornelia m weyand* and jörg j goronzy

introduction

s u m m a ry
t cells regulate the disease process in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) on multiple
levels and represent a logical choice for anti-inflammatory therapy. in the
inflamed joint they promote neoangiogenesis and lymphoid organogenesis,
and stimulate synoviocyte proliferation and development of bone-eroding
osteoclasts. the design of t-cell-targeted therapies for ra needs to take into
account the uniqueness of t-cell generation, turnover and differentiation in
affected patients. patients accumulate ‘old’ t cells that respond to alternate
regulatory signals because of an accelerated immune aging process; any
therapeutic interventions that increase the replicative stress of t cells
should, therefore, be avoided. instead, therapeutic approaches that raise
the threshold for t-cell activation are more promising. as a rule, antigenderived signals synergize with co-stimulatory signals to stimulate t cells;
such co-stimulatory signals are now targeted in novel immunosuppressive
therapies. an example is  xxxd52xxx  (soluble cytotoxic-t-lymphocyteassociated protein 4–immunoglobulin), which binds with high affinity to
 xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  and effectively suppresses inflammatory activity in ra. the
therapeutic benefits gained by disrupting t-cell co-stimulation indicate
that the pathogenesis of ra is driven by a more generalized abnormality
in t-cell activation thresholds rather than a highly selective action of
arthritogenic antigens.

early manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis
(ra) are often subtle, with barely detectable
joint swelling and with levels of biomarkers of
inflammation well within the normal range.1 the
patient’s complaints of pain and stiffness might
seem out of proportion, but rheumatologists know
that even mild symmetrical synovitis occurring in
an at-risk individual is likely to gain momentum.
if left untreated, synovitis will flourish and result
in irreversible tissue damage and loss of function.2 the spectrum of disease-modifying therapies for ra has markedly expanded; the ability to
suppress disease activity has noticeably improved.
nevertheless, ra remains a chronic disease lacking
a curative intervention.3,4
chronicity is a hallmark of ra and of autoimmune disease in general. the unremitting
course of ra is probably a built-in feature of the
immune responses driving the disease process,
reflecting the durability of immunologic
memory. immunologic memory is one of the
principles of the immune system; inducing it is
complex but, once achieved, erasing it is virtually impossible. induction and maintenance
of immunologic memory is a function of the
adaptive immune system, of t cells and b cells
that generate highly specific receptors, massively
increase in numbers upon stimulation, and
persist over long time periods.5 considering that
the adaptive immune system obviously cannot
‘forget’ misled immune responses, t cells and
b cells are logical candidates for immune interventions in ra. this review will summarize
current knowledge of t-cell biology and discuss
rationales for new t-cell-targeted therapies.
molecular events in t-cell
activation and differentiation

t lymphocytes are highly mobile biosensors with
a large spectrum of receptors. the t-cell receptor
(tcr) is unique because of its clonal diversity
and ability to recognize specific antigens. humans
have 300 billion t cells, with 300 million different
tcr specificities.6 the tcr binds to antigenic

peptides embedded in hla molecules and
presented on the surface of antigen-presenting
cells (apcs). tcr engagement initiates a cascade
of events leading to profound changes in gene
transcription and promoting t-cell growth,
differentiation, and cytokine production.
t-cell activation is achieved through posttranslational modification of cellular proteins
involved in interconnected pathways. 7
membrane-proximal events triggered by tcr
ligation involve regulation of multiple protein
tyrosine kinases (members of the src, syk, csk
and tec families) and the phosphorylation
status of their substrates, including adapter
proteins and effector enzymes. equally important are enzymes called protein tyrosine
phosphatases that remove phosphate groups
from  xxxd1075xxx -containing substrates.
ultimately,  xxxd1075xxx  turnover determines signal strength and the biologic consequences of tcr triggering.8 phospholipase
c-gamma an important signaling molecule, controls
calcium release from intracellular stores, initiating the nfat (calcium–calcineurin–nuclear
factor of activated t cells) pathway.9 other
downstream targets include all three subgroups
of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family,
the c-jun amino-terminal kinases, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and the
p38 proteins.
upon antigen recognition, t cells enter the
cell cycle and undergo clonal expansion, rapidly
producing sufficient antigen-specific t cells, and
generating memory t cells. antigen-triggered
t cells release large amounts of the growth
factor interleukin (il)-2 and enter a differentiation pathway (e.g. develop into type 
t helper [th] or type  t helper [th] cells)
to modulate the function of other hematopoietic
and nonhematopoietic cells.10 interferon-gamma
( xxxg1141xxx ) is a typical th1-cell-derived product,
that is highly efficient in regulating monocytes
and macrophages. th1 cells also produce tumor
necrosis factor (tnf), which targets numerous
cells and serves as a proinflammatory mediator.11 in addition to releasing cytokines, t cells
upregulate membrane receptors through which
they sense the tissue microenvironment, communicate with neighboring cells, and direct inflammatory responses. a typical example is rankl
(receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappab ligand), a
cell-surface molecule through which t cells guide
osteoclast differentiation and activation, thereby
influencing bone turnover.12

adding to the tcr signal:
the impact of co-stimulation

biologic outcomes of antigen recognition are
not simply determined by the nature and
intensity of the antigenic stimulus. as a rule,
tcr-mediated signals are combined with
co-stimulatory signals.13,14 the best understood co-stimulatory pathway involves cd28,
cytotoxic-t-lymphocyte-associated protein 4
( xxxg544xxx ; also known as  xxxg544xxx ),  xxxg396xxx , and
 xxxg398xxx .15 as the tcr makes contact with
antigen–hla complexes, the t-cell surface
receptor cd28 engages its ligands,  xxxg396xxx  and
 xxxg398xxx , on the apc. antigen recognition in
the absence of cd28 co-stimulation results
in partial activation and induces t-cell anergy,
a reversible state of t-cell nonresponsiveness.
the concept of co-stimulation holds for
many more receptors than cd28.11,16 also,
t-cell membrane receptors can function as inhibitors, preventing or reducing t-cell activation.17
a classic example is  xxxg544xxx , which appears
on the surface of recently activated t cells. in
essence, t-cell activation integrates numerous
recognition events, only one of which is antigen
binding. signals derived from regulatory molecules amplify or subtract from the tcr-initiated
signal by enhancing or reducing phosphorylation
of intracellular signaling molecules. with the
integration of multiple signals, t cells become
‘tunable’ cells. therapeutic interventions targeted
at t cells can, therefore, be directed towards
antigen recognition or interfere with the process
of co-stimulation (box 1).
t cells in rheumatoid arthritis

cd4+ t cells dominate the lymphocytic infiltrate in rheumatoid synovitis. cd8+ cells occur
less frequently and localize in different synovial subregions.18 b cells are present in variable
numbers and, in some patients, are distinctly
rare.19–21 these lymphocytes are accompanied
by several types of apcs, including dendritic cells
and macrophages. other important partners for
tissue-infiltrating t cells are stromal cells, especially fibroblast-like synoviocytes (fls),22,23 as
well as endothelial cells and osteoclasts.
lymphocyte tissue invasion in rheumatoid
synovitis is remarkably organized, recapitulating
the process of lymphoid organogenesis.24,25
often, tissue-residing t cells and b cells are
arranged in structured lymphoid organizations. such lymphoid architectures resemble
lymph nodes, generating t-cell zones, b-cell

zones and germinal centers. t cells and b cells
can also be arranged in aggregates lacking the
structural elements of germinal centers. a third
pattern of diffuse synovitis exists in which
t cells and b cells are dispersed throughout the
synovial layer. ectopic lymphoid organogenesis
contributes to rheumatoid synovitis in its own
right; by optimizing the three-dimensional
arrangements of t cells interacting with
other cells, local conditions sustain immune
responses that would remain subthreshold in a
nonpermissive environment.26
interactions of synovial t cells with
nonlymphoid partners are important for building
the tissue infrastructure supporting chronic
inflammation. specifically, t cells participate in
angiogenesis by regulating proangiogenic and
antiangiogenic mediators.27 one example is the
tissue production of the angioregulatory matrix
protein,  xxxg2279xxx .28 clearly, mediators controlling the synovial architecture are
important targets for therapeutic interventions.
convincing evidence for direct t-cell involvement in driving rheumatoid synovitis has come
from numerous studies, including those verifying the effective suppression of inflammation
in human synovium–scid chimeras following
t-cell depletion,29 and those asserting a

pathways driving the disease process in rheumatoid arthritis. diseasepromoting t cells directly release proinflammatory cytokines and are critically
involved in regulating processes that enable and sustain chronic tissue
inflammation, such as lymphoid organogenesis and angiogenesis. t cells
support tissue damage by inducing hyperplasia of synovial fibroblasts and

issues and the severity of joint damage in recentonset ra.30 the composition of the synovial
t-cell infiltrate predicts the outcome of autologous stem-cell transplantation in severe
ra, indicating continuous t-cell regulation in
chronic disease.31
t cells emerge as multifaceted regulators
that ultimately control numerous disease pathways in synovitis (figure 1). direct cell–cell
contact and communication through secreted
mediators are involved in interactions between
t cells and fls.  xxxg1166xxx  represents an important
t cell-derived factor that facilitates synoviocyte
regulation.32 upon stimulation, fls produce
inflammatory cytokines, such as tnf and  xxxg1170xxx ,
release chemokines and tissue-digestive enzymes,
and proliferate.33 synoviocyte proliferation leads
to membrane hyperplasia underlying pannus
formation, cartilage and bone invasion, and
structural damage. in turn, activated synoviocytes provide survival signals for t cells, thereby
sustaining chronic immune responses in the
affected joint.
synovial t cells also include granzyme bpositive cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls), which
are frequent in synovial biopsies from patients
with rapidly progressing disease.30 specific
ligands for ctls are expressed on endothelial
cells and synoviocytes.34 in addition to cytotoxic

critically involved in regulating lymphotoxin-beta

production and formation of ectopic lymphoid
architectures.18 another subset of tissue-residing
cd8+ t cells, cd8+cd56+ t cells, displays antiinflammatory functions and thus shares some
properties with regulatory t cells (treg).35
recent studies have focused on cd4+ t cells
that regulate bone turnover and induce the
bone loss that is typical of ra. bone resorption is facilitated by osteoclasts, multinucleated
giant cells that originate from progenitors of
the monocyte–macrophage lineage; differentiation of these cells is regulated through macrophage- xxxg526xxx  and rankl. in

t-cell-targeted therapies

t cells were among the first therapeutic targets
explored during the early phase of developing
biologic therapies. animal models of inflammatory polyarthritis supported the concept that
cd4+ t cells respond to arthritogenic antigens
in the presence of mhc class ii molecules and,
accordingly, experimental protocols examined the
effects of depleting and nondepleting antibodies
directed at the  xxxg388xxx , as well as other
t cell molecules (including  xxxd107xxx  against
 xxxg393xxx , anti-cd5 ricin toxin, and diphtheria
toxin–il-2 fusion protein). efforts were made to
directly interfere with the trimolecular complex
of the tcr, antigenic peptide, and hla class ii
molecule using, for example, the dr4–dr1
peptide vaccine, tcr vbeta peptide vaccine,
collagen, cartilage glycoprotein 39.39 insufficient
knowledge of t-cell biology in humans, the role
of t-cell regulatory molecules in modulating
t-cell activation, and t-cell homeostasis in
middle-aged humans encouraged inappropriate
study design. accordingly, clinical benefits were
borderline, and for some of the interventions
the side effects were severe. with our growing
understanding of how human t cells function
in health and disease, novel therapeutic strategies have emerged (table 1). inhibition of t-cell

pathways will attract much attention in the future.
the principle of blocking cytoplasmic signaling
events in order to suppress t-cell responses is
widely applied in allotransplantation. two such
agents,  xxxd1781xxx  and tacrolimus (fk506),
have shown clinical efficacy in suppressing
rheumatoid inflammation.40,41 both function by
forming complexes with immunophilins, inhibit
the calcium–calmodulin-dependent phosphatase,
calcineurin, and impair dephosphorylation of
nfat family proteins.
blocking t-cell antigen
recognition

important lessons were learned from experimental protocols that explored the concept
of restoring self-tolerance in the individual
by eliminating disease-relevant t cells and
repopulating with uncommitted t cells.
therapeutic interventions have ranged from
autologous stem-cell transplantation to antibody-mediated lymphocyte depletion, but
responses have been disappointing. antibodybased protocols have successfully depleted t cells
but were complicated by long-term lymphopenia and selective survival of memory t cells,42
providing a survival advantage for proarthritogenic t cells.43 persistence of lymphopenia led to
studies of t-cell homeostasis and uncovered the
phenomenon of premature immune aging of ra
patients, resulting from reduced immune system
regenerative capacity, compared to age-matched
controls.44,45 one method to selectively target
disease-relevant t cells and induce immune
deviation is the use of tailored peptides.46
epitope-specific immunotherapy can change
cytokine production patterns; results from
clinical trials assessing the clinical impact should
be forthcoming.47
blocking co-stimulatory signals

inhibiting co-stimulatory signals while maintaining antigen recognition might be a sophisticated way to suppress but not eliminate t-cell
responsiveness (table 1).4,48 this principle has
been tested with  xxxd52xxx  ( xxxd52xxx ), a recombinant fusion protein comprising the extracellular
domain of human  xxxg544xxx  fused with the fc
portion of  xxxd2207xxx .49  xxxg544xxx  is an important molecule in the cd28/ xxxg544xxx – xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx 
pathway.15 cd28 is constitutively expressed on
many t cells and delivers activation and survival
signals upon binding with  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx .  xxxg544xxx 
also binds to  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  with markedly higher

affinity than does cd28; soluble  xxxg544xxx  can block
access for cd28, thus disrupting t-cell responses
that depend on cd28-mediated co-stimulation
(figure 2). by binding to  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  on apcs,
 xxxd52xxx  also initiates a reverse signal and
alters apc function. in experimental systems,
both soluble  xxxg544xxx  and membrane-anchored
 xxxg544xxx  on regulatory t cells trigger enzymemediated tryptophan catabolism in apcs, a
strongly immunosuppressive pathway. finally,
selected t cells express  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx . by binding
 xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  on the t-cell surface,  xxxd52xxx  can
directly modulate t-cell function.50
initial studies explored the clinical effects
of  xxxd52xxx  in patients with psoriasis; almost
half of the patients achieved a sustained 50%
improvement of disease.51 clinical efficacy has
also been reported from trials testing  xxxd52xxx 
in ra. an initial placebo-controlled, doubleblind, dose-ranging study in 90 patients with
ra gave encouraging results for  xxxd52xxx  monotherapy.52 in a phase ii trial,  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg
(n = 105 patients), 10 mg/kg (n = 115), or placebo
(n = 119) was added to methotrexate. after
6 months, significantly higher numbers of  xxxd52xxx -treated patients achieved improvement
in their symptoms of 20% (acr), 50%
(acr) or 70% (acr) according to the
american college of rheumatology
criteria. in addition, quality-of-life measures
showed clinically meaningful effects in patients
given 10 mg/kg  xxxd52xxx . the overall safety
profile of  xxxd52xxx  seemed similar to that of
placebo.53 treatment responses were sustained
over 12 months.54 a large phase iii trial has
examined the efficacy and safety of  xxxd52xxx 
(10 mg/kg) in patients with an inadequate
responses to methotrexate and has shown
clinical improvement and slowing of radiographic progression.55 published data are also
available for patients with ra with an inadequate
response to anti-tnf therapy.56 patients in this
trial had long-standing disease and moderateto-severe disability and were randomized to
receive  xxxd52xxx  (10 mg/kg, n = 258) or placebo
(n = 133). co-stimulatory blockage resulted
in significant higher rates of acr20, acr50
and acr70 responses and improvement in
physical functioning.

t cells are recruited to the inflamed peripheral
tissue. t cells entering the synovium are enddifferentiated memory t cells. in ra, the t-cell
memory compartment has distinct features,60
mainly imposed by a process of accelerated
aging.61 aging t cells undergo a sequence of
losing and gaining surface receptors. in contrast
to young t cells, they lose cd28 expression
and use a novel set of co-stimulatory receptors.14 specifically, cd4+ t cells in ra acquire
expression of the natural-killer-cell receptors
kir2ds2 and nkg2d, and the chemokine
receptor cx3cr1.62–64 all three receptors regulate the functional activity of nk cells. their

are cd28+. in the lymph node, t cell–apc interaction depends on cd28– xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  costimulation.15 this pathway affects initial antigen
priming and determines the process of homeostatic t-cell proliferation, a mechanism delivering
subthreshold activation signals that regulate
t-cell autoproliferation and replenishment.

inconsequential, because memory t cells use
this pathway much less dependably. here,
reverse signaling by inhibiting apc function
might be more important. on the other hand,
disrupting cd28– xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  interaction
in the lymph node, the primary residence of
naive and central memory t cells, reduces new
t-cell priming and downregulates the supply
of autoreactive t cells. ra patients might
be particularly responsive to these immunosuppressive effects of  xxxd52xxx . patients with
ra not only accumulate large populations
of cd28-deficient t cells,65 but in addition,
cd28 membrane expression on all naive
t cells and the remaining memory cd4+ t cells
is reduced.66 the lower surface expression of
cd28 would render these t cells more sensitive
to  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  blocking.
adapting therapeutic strategies to the particular microenvironment in which t cells receive
disease-relevant signals or mediate pathogenic
functions will greatly enhance the spectrum of
t-cell-targeted therapies. specifically, instead
of disrupting t-cell activation through interference with activating or co-stimulatory
signals, it would be much more elegant to
partner with nature and utilize nature’s timeexplored strategy of downregulating t cells
through negative signals. a growing number
of t-cell regulatory molecules are being identified which stop immune responses instead of
enhancing them. triggering such inhibitory
receptors might be the most elegant way of
paralyzing disease-maintaining t cells in ra.

conclusions

t cells promote numerous disease pathways in
ra, and provide a unique opportunity to target
several disease-relevant immune functions by
directing immunomodulatory interventions
towards the process of t-cell activation. t cells
undergo activation when recognizing specific
antigen but, in a process called co-stimulation,
the activation intensity is fine-tuned by a
multitude of regulatory receptors. disrupting
co-stimulation is emerging as an effective
mode of immunosuppression, attaining antiinflammatory effects even if the specific antigen
is unknown. co-stimulatory receptors and their
ligands vary in different microenvironments,
including the inflamed joint, providing the
opportunity for highly selected and sophisticated
t-cell directed therapies.

key points
■
t cells are key players in rheumatoid arthritis
and, by virtue of their regulatory and effector
functions, contribute to several disease pathways
■
t-cell activation requires integration of
multiple signals, one of them deriving from antigen
recognition and others from co-stimulatory receptors
■
interfering with co-stimulatory signals can
inhibit t-cell activation without the need to identify
disease-relevant antigens
■
t-cell activation in rheumatoid arthritis occurs in
the synovium as well as lymphoid organs, involving
distinct co-stimulatory receptor–ligand pairs in
each microenvironment
■
patients with rheumatoid arthritis accumulate
prematurely aged t cells that express novel
regulatory receptors and respond to specific
environmental cues
