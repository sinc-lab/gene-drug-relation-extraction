the concentration of  xxxd2042xxx  required to inhibit the assembly or to
induce the disassembly of chick brain map2:tubulin microtubules is markedly
dependent upon the microtubule protein concentration. analysis of this relationship shows that  xxxd2042xxx  and tubulin compete for common map2
sites, that map2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-'  xxxd2042xxx , and that
the k, of these sites is 2 20 p,m  xxxd2042xxx . it is proposed that two
molecules of  xxxd2042xxx  interact with each of the three tubulinbinding sites of map2 and inhibit the map2:tubulin interaction by neutralising
two highly conserved basic residues.

introduction

 xxxd2042xxx  (emp) binds to neuronal
microtubule-associated proteins [wallin et al., 19851,
and inhibits the microtubule assembly induced by map2,
tau, and the c-terminal proteolytic map2-fragment
which contains the tubulin-binding domain [kanje et al.,
1985; friden et al., 19871. high emp concentrations
(100-500 pm) are required to either inhibit assembly or
to induce disassembly [kanje et al., 1985; friden et al.,
19871. by contrast, a comparitively high affinity is indicated by the minimal dissociation of the [6,7-3h]emp:
map2 complex during gel filtration [wallin et al., 19851.
this discrepancy suggests that emp and tubulin may
compete for the same binding site(s) on the map2 and tau
molecules.
the effects of emp have therefore been examined
as a function of the concentration of a stoichiometric
mixture of chick brain tubulin and map2. analysis of
the effects of emp is complicated by three concurrent
processes: 1) the binding of emp to map2; 2) the binding of map2 to tubulin and the map2-induced microtubule assembly; and 3) the interaction between map2
and tubulin to form rings and other oligomeric structures
[vallee and borisy, 19781, which are preferentially used
0 1990 wiley-liss, inc.

during the early stages of microtubule elongation [burns
and islam, 1984a; bayley et al., 19851. these oligomers
may constitute a significant fraction of the unassembled
proteins under conditions in which the assembly is inhibited by emp.
these complications can be minimised by extrapolating to low protein concentrations. this analysis
shows that map2 binds 5-6 moles.mole-' emp with an
apparent dissociation constant of 2 20 p m emp.
methods

microtubule protein was purified from day-old
chick brains by two cycles of assembly and disassembly
[burns and islam, 19811, except that the buffer consisted
of 100 mm pipes, 2.5 mm egta, 0.5 mm mgcl,, 0.1
mm edta (ph 6.9 with koh). the protein consists of
a stoichiometric mixture of map2 and tubulin. the protein only contains a minimal amount of tau, determined

by sds-gel electrophoresis and by western blotting (unpublished observation), and this is a direct consequence
of the minimal axonal breakage achieved by the selected
mild homogenisation. one notable advantage of the
chick protein is that the assembly is absolutely dependent
upon the concentration of co-purifying maps as there is
no detectable assembly of either phospho- or deaecellulose purified tubulin.
an extensive (2 h) cold depolymerisation following
the second cycle of assembly reduces the relevent level
of map2 phosphorylation to > 1 mole-mole-' (unpublished observation). immediately before use, the protein
was eluted through a sephadex g-50 column (28 x 0.9
cm) equilibrated with assembly buffer (100 mm pipes,
0.5 mm mgcl,, 1 mm edta, ph 6.8 with koh)
[kanje et al., 19851. the void protein was adjusted to 1
mm gtp and an appropriate concentration of emp, degassed, and transferred to warmed cuvettes in a beckman
du-8 spectrophotometer. the assembly was initiated by
the temperature-jump to 37°c and was measured by the
turbidity increase at a,,,, applying the measured scattering coefficient that one absorbancy unit is equivalent
to the assembly of 44 p m tubulin. the emp-induced
disassembly was examined by monitoring the extent of
microtubule disassembly following the addition of
known amounts of emp, correcting for the concomitant
dissociation resulting from the increased assay volume.
samples were prepared for electron microscopy by fixing
in warmed 0.1% v/v glutaraldehyde in assembly buffer
and staining with 1% w/v uranyl acetate. microtubule
lengths were photographed ( x 10,000) and measured
from the negatives, doubling the lengths of any which
extended beyond the field of view.
the map2 concentration was determined from the
absorption at a,,, of the pooled fractions from the
sephadex g-50 column by using the measured coefficient that one absorbancy unit is equivalent to 895 nm
map2. this assumes that the map2:tubulin stoichiometry is 1:12, as indicated by ultrastructural studies (amos
[ 19771 but see discussion). total microtubule protein
concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically
at a280 (el m g m - ' = 0.93) or calorimetrically [hartree, 19721by using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard,
in the studies of dynamic instability. the concentration
of freshly prepared emp was measured at az6, (e, mm
= 1.0) [wallin et al., 19851.
emp (a.b. leo, helsingborg, sweden) was a generous gift from dr. margareta wallin. all other reagents were purchased from sigma chemical co. ltd.

fig. 1. effects of  xxxd2042xxx  on the assembly and disassembly of map2:tubulin microtubules. microtubule protein (3.50
m g m - ' ) was assembled with 0 ( 0 ) or 156 pm (a)  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate. disassembly of the control sample was induced by addition
of two successive additions of  xxxd2042xxx  (each to 156
pm), with the data being corrected for the slight disassembly ( 52%)
resulting from the dilution-induced disassembly.

merisation (fig. 1). addition of 156 p m emp to preassembled microtubules causes their rapid disassembly to
exactly the same amount of polymer as when the emp is
present during assembly (fig. 1). increasing the emp
concentration to 307 pm induces further depolymerisation. these properties are critical to evaluating the effects of the emp concentration when a single sample is
titrated with successive additions of emp, with the appropriate correction for the dilution-induced disassembly.
the steady-state critical concentration (c, or ratio
of the dissociation to the association rate constants) in the
pipes/mgcl,/edta buffer was determined to be 208 nm
map2 by assembling increasing concentrations of the
microtubule protein and extrapolating to the ordinate intercept (fig. 2). the assembly-competency of the protein
(c49%), calculated from the slope, was significantly
lower than that routinely observed for the chick protein
using other buffer conditions, and this may relate to the
very low mg+ concentration. addition of emp to preassembled microtubules to a final concentration of 72
p m lowered the c, but did not affect the assembly competency (fig. 2). this is similar to one previous report
[kanje et al., 19851 but differs from a second report in
which emp altered the assembly competency but did not
affect the c,, as determined by extrapolation to the ordinate [friden et al., 19871. the latter could be reproduced by using much higher emp concentrations: it was
however artefactual, in that conditions which effected
complete microtubule disassembly did not fully abolish
the turbidity. this residual turbidity, which is proportional to the initial protein concentration, is due to nonspecific aggregation of the protein.

assembled microtubules were sheared (10 passages through a 100 pl hamilton syringe) and samples
removed for either pelleting (loo,ooog,5 min, beckman
airfuge) or for electron microscopy before and after a
further 5 min incubation at 37°c. the mean microtubule
length increased from 0.848 & 0.556 p m (n = 192) to
3.987 p m (n = 266), while the pelleted protein concentration was unchanged (0.675 2 0.085 vs. 0.655 it
0.030 mgarnl-'). the microtubules therefore exhibit dynamic instability, so that the steady-state c, pertains to
the number average of the critical concentrations of microtubules with or without a terminal gtp-cap. the rate
of length redistribution (5.67 dimersasec- ') is intermediate between the values found for this protein in a mesbased buffer at ph 6.4 (fi 2.32 dimers*sec-l) and in the
same buffer supplemented with 67 mm nacl (11.43
dimersasec- ; unpublished observation). this is consistent with the higher ionic strength and ph of the pipesbased buffer, and shows that map2 bound to the assembled microtubule is in equilibrium with free map2. this
equilibrium accounts for the lowering of the steady-state
c, observed with emp (fig. 2), in that the map-binding
sites on the assembled microtubules are not fully occupied so that there is some apparent assembly of pure
tubulin.
two concentrations of microtubule protein (1.95
and 3.29 rngsml-') were assembled to steady state and

challenged with increasing concentrations of emp (fig.
3 ) . the microtubule protein concentration affects both
the amount of emp required to induce a 50% disassembly and the extent of disassembly as a function of the
increased emp concentration. while the titration profile
is similar to a previous report [kanje et al., 19851, the
effects of the protein concentration had not been noted.
as very high emp concentrations only resulted in
fi 80% loss of turbidity, due to the continued presence of
the non-specific aggregates, the subsequent analysis has
been restricted to emp concentrations effecting < 67%
disassembly.
the dissociation constant (kd) is related to the concentrations of protein ([pi) and ligand ([l]):

where [pl] is the concentration of protein with bound
ligand and n is the number of identical, non-interacting
binding sites. consequently:
in k,

n ln([p]/[pl] - 1)

+ ln(l)

so that a plot of ln(lifractiona1 assembly - 1) vs.
ln([emp]) should yield a straight line of slope n passing
through the abscissa at in kd.
expressing the extent in( lifractional assembly - 1)
as a function of in (emp) shows that the apparent k, and
the apparent number of binding sites are both dependent

upon the protein concentration (fig. 4). in addition, the
slope is not constant, so that the apparent number of
binding sites is smaller at low emp concentrations.
these effects are consistent with emp and tubulin competing for common binding sites on the map2 molecule.
the apparent k, increases approximately linearly
with the concentration of assembled microtubule protein
in the control samples (fig. 5), and extrapolates to fi 20
pm emp when the protein concentration equals c,, i.e.
when there is no net assembly. the abscissa intercept
equals - 190 nm map2, a value which is very similar to
the observed c, (208 nm map2, fig. 2).
as the lniln plots (e.g., fig. 4) are non-linear, the
apparent number of binding sites has been computed
over the limited range of 33-67% disassembly, i.e., at
emp concentrations close to the apparent k,. a semi-log
plot of this number has been plotted against the extent of
assembly in the control (fig. 5): this plot recognises that
the number of sites with bound emp will asymptotically
approach zero as the concentration of the stoichiometric
mixture of map2 and tubulin increases. the intercept
4.86 emp-binding sites per
shows that there are
map2 molecule when there is no net assembly.
consequently, 20 p m emp is required to 50% saturate the map2-binding sites when the concentration of
protein available for assembly equals the c,. the total
map2 concentration therefore equals twice the c,, i.e.
380-416 nm. this difference in concentration has minimal effect on the deduced k,, but extrapolation of figure 5 to -400 nm map2 increases the number of binding sites to
5.4 moles.mole- '.

the map2 concentration. this has been calculated by
assuming that the map2:tubulin stoichiometry is 1:12
moles*mole- based upon image analysis of map2:tubulin microtubules [amos, 19771. this stoichometry has
also been obtained by quantitative gel electrophoresis
[burns and islam, 1984b], but this assumed a molecular
weight for map2 of 286,000 da and that map2 and
tubulin have equal staining properties with coomassie
blue. subsequent sequence analysis showed that map2
has a molecular weight of 198,978 da [lewis et al.,
19861, which implies that the map2 content is overestimated by coomassie staining by fi 30%. this is also
indicated by comparing the quantitation by coomassie
blue staining with the tyrosine content determined by
iodination. increasing amounts of iodinated chick microtubule protein were fractionated on sds-polyacrylamide
gels, stained with coomassie blue, sliced, and counted.
correcting the 1251 counts for the number of tyrosine
residues (26 in mouse map2 and a total of 35 in the
chick a- and p-tubulins) [lewis et al., 1986; pratt and
cleveland, 1988; monteiro and cleveland, 1988, respectively] showed that the coomassie blue staining of map2
is fi 20% greater than that of the tubulin (unpublished
observation). the overestimation of the map2 content
by coomassie blue staining therefore compensates for the
revised molecular weight, and justifies using the ultra-
