activation during immune stimulation with cpg dna

abstract
innate immune cells recognize pathogens by detecting molecular patterns that are distinct from
those of the host. one such pattern is unmethylated cpg dinucleotides, which are common in bacterial dna but not in vertebrate genomes. macrophages respond to such cpg motifs in bacterial dna
or synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (odn) by inducing  xxxg1559xxx  and secreting proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (il-6) and  xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ), but the mechanisms regulating this have been unclear. cpg odn-stimulated cells produce reactive oxygen species (ros) and
have a decreased ratio of intracellular glutathione/ xxxd2811xxx  (gsh/ xxxd2811xxx ), indicating a
shift to a more oxidized intracellular redox state. to determine whether this may play a role in mediating the cpg-induced macrophage activation, the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  redox state was manipulated in the
murine macrophagelike cell line raw264.7. treatment of cells with  xxxd444xxx  to inhibit  xxxg981xxx  (gr) enhanced the cpg-induced intracellular oxidation and decreased the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx ,
with increased activation of  xxxg1559xxx  and a doubling in the cpg-induced production of il-6 and
 xxxg2296xxx . experimental manipulation of the intracellular  xxxd2811xxx  concentration during inhibition of
cellular prooxidant production demonstrated that increased intracellular  xxxd2811xxx  is a primary signal
that is directly or indirectly required for cpg-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation but is not in itself sufficient
to trigger this in the absence of cpg odn. these data suggest the existence of a second cpg-induced
intracellular signal, independent of  xxxd2811xxx , mediating the activation of innate immunity by bacterial
dna.

introduction

c

pg dinucleotides are found

at the expected frequency of 1:16 in prokaryotic dna, whereas in
mammalian genomes, the occurrence of cpg dinucleotides is markedly reduced (bird, 1987). in addition to
this overall decrease in frequency, cpg dinucleotides are
generally methylated in vertebrate dna, whereas
prokaryotic cpg dinucleotides are not (bird, 1987). b
cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells express the toll-

like receptor-9 ( xxxg2293xxx ), which makes them capable of
recognizing these differences between prokaryotic and
mammalian dna based on the presence of unmethylated
cpg dinucleotides within particular sequence contexts
(cpg motifs: gacgtt for murine, gtcgtt for human) (messina et al., 1991; krieg et al., 1995; ballas et
al., 1996; stacey et al., 1996; yi et al., 1996a; tokunaga

expression of costimulatory molecules, immunoglobulin
and cytokine secretion, enhanced antigen presentation, b
cell proliferation, and protection from b cell apoptosis
(messina et al., 1991; krieg et al., 1995; ballas et al.,
1996; stacey et al., 1996; yi et al., 1996a, 1998a). the
mouse macrophagelike cell line, raw 264.7, is induced
by cpg odn to secrete increased amounts of interleukin-6 (il-6) and  xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ),
which appears to be secondary to the activation of  xxxg1559xxx 
(stacey et al., 1996; sparwasser et al., 1997a; yi and
krieg, 1998a). previous investigations into the mechanism by which the cpg-dependent signal is transduced
have shown a requirement for production of reactive
oxygen species (ros) by the responding cell (yi et al.,
1996b, 1998b). this ros production is a very early
event, being demonstrable as soon as 5 minutes poststimulation (yi et al., 1996b, 1998b). induction of ros
generation also appears to be a necessary signal for
mounting a response, as antioxidants and inhibitors of
ros production block all the effects induced by cpg
odn, including the secretion of cytokines and activation
of  xxxg1559xxx  (yi et al., 1996b, 1998b).
in addition to their ability to cause gross cellular damage leading to necrotic cell death, ros are increasingly
appreciated as capable of affecting cellular function in a
number of ways, including the induction of apoptosis
(sato et al., 1995; sun and ross, 1996; gardner et al.,
1997; bustamante et al., 1997), stimulation of cell proliferation (burdon, 1995; irani et al., 1997; joneson and
bar-sagi, 1998), and malignant transformation (irani et
al., 1997; nakamura et al., 1997; suh et al., 1999). ros
have been proposed to mediate apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial release of the proapoptotic factors,  xxxg569xxx  and apoptosis-inducing factor (aif) (green
and reed, 1998; blackstone and green, 1999). on the
other hand, mitochondria have also been suggested to
serve as a primary source of apoptosis-inducing ros
(green and reed, 1998; blackstone and green, 1999). in
contrast to antiproliferative effects, ros have been reported to stimulate proliferation in certain tissues, including endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (zafari
et al., 1998; wolin, 2000; sundaresan et al., 1995). some
of the most intriguing evidence for the role of ros in the
positive regulation of cellular growth and proliferation
comes from work implicating intracellular ros production in various mitogenic and oncogenic pathways.
specifically, the transforming potential of both ras and
rac, members of a family of low molecular weight
gtpases, has been shown to be dependent on the production of superoxide anion (irani et al., 1997; joneson and
bar-sagi, 1998). more recently, a newly reported nonphagocytic nadph oxidase has been shown to be capable of transforming nih 3t3 fibroblasts (suh et al.,
1999). in addition to driving apoptosis and proliferation,
ros also appear to be capable of inducing certain target

kirsch et al.

cells to perform their characteristic effector functions,
such as the secretion of cytokines and expression of adhesion molecules (zafari et al., 1998; wolin, 1991, 2000;
wang and doerschuk, 2000; ali et al., 1999). thus, ros
can be seen as important mediators not only of pathology
but also of normal physiology.
whereas evidence for a significant role of ros in cellular physiology is growing, the mechanisms by which
ros might exert their effects are less clear. increases in
steady-state levels of ros (i.e., h2o2) would be expected
to increase the conversion of glutathione (gsh) to  xxxd2811xxx  ( xxxd2811xxx ) during the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 by glutathione peroxidase. this change in
 xxxd2811xxx  levels could be sensed directly by critical thiol
residues in proteins involved in cpg signaling via disulfide exchange reactions involving  xxxd2811xxx  or indirectly via
alterations in the redox state of  xxxg905xxx  or thioredoxin, which could then pass the signal to critical thiols
found in signaling molecules. many potential mechanisms of ros signal transduction have been postulated,
including the direct inactivation of protein phosphatases
(krejsa and schieven, 1998; bogumil et al., 2000; barrett
et al., 1999) and the activation of protein kinases (krejsa
and schieven, 1998; sun et al., 2000; yoshizumi et al.,
2000; abe and berk, 1999), as well as the modulation of
transcription factor binding to promoter sequences (sen
and packer, 1996; galang and hauser, 1993; hayashi et
al., 1993; hirota et al., 1997; huang and domann, 1998;
akamatsu et al., 1997). for example, the activation of
 xxxg1559xxx , a central regulator of lymphocyte and monocyte/macrophage responses, is reportedly highly sensitive to the intracellular redox state (sen and packer,
1996). molecular targets for the action of ros could include iron-sulfur clusters (johnson, 1998), such as are
found in the mrna-binding protein (iron regulatory protein [irp]) (hanson and leibold, 1999; pantopoulos et
al., 1996; pantopoulos and hentze, 1995), or the free
sulfhydryls of cysteine residues in the dna-binding domain of many transcription factors. an obvious potential
link between ros and functional downstream targets is
alterations in the intracellular gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratios, inasmuch as the intracellular gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  pool is responsive
to metabolic redox state and can directly mediate the
modification of protein sulfhydryls, which might affect
many signal transduction pathways (klatt et al., 1999).
because our previous studies indicated that cpg odn
induced the production of ros, which would be expected to alter intracellular gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  redox states, the
present study was designed to determine (1) if cpg
odn-induced ros production could materially alter the
intracellular gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  redox state, (2) if cpg odn-induced changes in the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  redox state were required to mediate cpg odn-dependent effects, and (3)
if a net increase in  xxxd2811xxx  content alone was sufficient to
recapitulate cpg-induced immune activation.

ros role in cpg dna signaling

materials and methods
reagents
dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (h2dcfda)
was obtained from molecular probes (eugene, or) and
was prepared as a 20-mm stock solution in dmso,
which was stored at 280°c. synthetic phosphorothioate
backbone odns (s-odn) were provided by the coley
pharmaceutical group (wellesley, ma). s-odns used
for this study were cpg s-odn (1826: tccatgacgttcctgacgtt) and control non-cpg s-odn
(1982: tccaggacttctctcaggtt). il-6 and
 xxxg2296xxx  cytokine elisa antibodies were from bd
pharmingen (san diego, ca).  xxxd2811xxx  ester was prepared
by h2o2 oxidation of gsh ethyl ester (sigma-aldrich,
st. louis, mo).  xxxg1559xxx  consensus odn for use as an
emsa probe was obtained from operon technologies
(alameda, ca).  xxxg1559xxx  supershift antibodies were from
santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, ca). all other
reagents were purchased from sigma-aldrich.

cell culture
the mouse macrophagelike cell line raw 264.7
(american type culture collection, manassas, va) was
cultured at 37°c in a 5% co2 humidified incubator and
maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(dmem) (life technologies, gaithersburg, md) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (fbs) (hyclone, logan, ut), 1.5 mm l-glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin.
cells were stimulated for 30 minutes to 24 hours with
0.6–6 mg/ml cpg or non-cpg s-odn and then assessed
for prooxidant production, gsh redox status, cytokine
production, or  xxxg1559xxx  activation.

ros measurement
raw 264.7 cells were harvested, washed three times
with hbss, and resuspended in fresh, prewarmed hbss
at 2 3 106 cells/ml. h2dcfda was then added to a final
concentration of 25 mm, and the cells were loaded into a
96-well microtiter plate and placed in a 37°c, 5% co2
humidified incubator for 30 minutes to allow loading of
the dye. during this same 30-minute interval, some cultures were treated with inhibitors of ros production, including 10 mm diphenylene iodonium (dpi) (sigmaaldrich). following dye loading and inhibitor pretreatment, cells were treated with medium, 2 mg/ml of the
cpg s-odn 1826 or of the non-cpg s-odn 1982, 10
mm h2o2, 25 mm  xxxd2563xxx , or 10 ng/ml phorbol
12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma). after 30-minutes stimulation, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), and the conversion of nonfluorescent h2dcfda to the highly fluorescent dichlo-

rofluoresein (dcf) was measured using a bio-tek
instruments (winooski, vt) fl500 microplate spectrofluorimeter. in order to control for uptake, ester cleavage,
and efflux changes that could affect fluorescence intensity independent of dye oxidation, similarly treated
cells were stained with dcfda directly. an increase in
fluorescence between treatment groups stained with
h2dcfda was taken as indicative of an increase in the
production of ros if the similarly treated groups stained
with the oxidation-insensitive dye dcfda showed no
differences.

intracellular gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  measurements
raw 264.7 cells were harvested, washed three times
with hbss, and resuspended in fresh, prewarmed
dmem at 2 3 106 cells/ml. cells were incubated at
37°c, 5% co2, 100% humidity for 30 minutes, and then
half the cultures were treated with either medium or
medium containing 30 mm of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1nitrosourea ( xxxd444xxx ), an irreversible inhibitor of  xxxd2811xxx 
reductase (gr). after 15 minutes treatment with  xxxd444xxx ,
cells were washed three times with hbss and resuspended in fresh, prewarmed dmem at 2 3 106 cells/ml,
followed by stimulation with cpg s-odn 1826 or noncpg s-odn 1982.
deproteinized acid-soluble thiol extracts were made
from 107 cells per condition, using 5-sulfosalicyclic acid
(5-ssa) and the method previously described (tietze,
1969). measurement of total glutathione (gsh 1  xxxd2811xxx )
was made by a modification of the method of tietze, and
 xxxd2811xxx  was determined by incubating the extracts with 2vinylpyridine to derivatize the gsh prior to running the
tietze assay (tietze, 1969; vandeputte et al., 1994;
goswami et al., 2000). the rate of dithionitrobenzoic acid
(dtnb) reduction in the tietze assay was measured at
405 nm using a molecular devices v-max microplate
spectrophotometer (menlo park, ca). intracellular [gsh]
was determined by subtracting 2[ xxxd2811xxx ] from the total
glutathione content.

cytokine elisas
raw 264.7 cells were harvested, washed three times
with hbss, and resuspended in fresh, prewarmed
dmem at 1 3 105 cells/ml. the cells were split into two
treatment groups, half of which received the indicated
concentrations of  xxxd444xxx , followed by drug washout, as
described. the cells were then loaded into a 96-well microtiter plate and stimulated with 2 mg/ml of cpg sodn 1826 or non-cpg s-odn 1982. following stimulation, cell cultures were placed in a 37°c, 5% co2,
humidified incubator for either 8 hours (for  xxxg2296xxx ) or 24
hours (il-6). after the indicated incubation times, culture supernatants were harvested and assayed by elisa,
as previously described (yi et al., 1996b; yi et al., 1998b).

emsa

preparation of  xxxd2811xxx  ester

raw 264.7 cells were harvested, washed three times
with hbss, and resuspended in fresh, prewarmed
dmem at 1 3 105 cells/ml. a total of 1 3 107 cells per
treatment condition were used. following treatment with
gsh-modulating drugs, cell cultures were stimulated
with 0.6 or 6 mg/ml of the cpg or non-cpg s-odn. at 1
hour poststimulation, cells were harvested, and nuclear
extracts were prepared for analysis by emsa as previously described (yi and krieg, 1998a). a 32p-labeled oligonucleotide containing the  xxxg1559xxx  binding sequence
from the c-myc promoter ure (59-tgcaggaagtccgggttttccccaacccccc-39) was used to determine  xxxg1559xxx  dna-binding activity in the nuclear extracts by emsa. a total of 1 mg of nuclear protein was
incubated with 20,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe in binding buffer for 30 minutes at ambient temperature, followed by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 3 tbe buffer (90 mm tris, 90 mm
boric acid, 2 mm edta, ph 8.0) essentially as described
(yi and krieg, 1998a). the gels were dried and then subjected to autoradiography. specificity of the probe-nuclear protein complex was demonstrated by incubating
the extracts with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wildtype or mutant  xxxg1559xxx  odn. in some experiments, antibodies to various components of the  xxxg1559xxx  complex
were incubated with the nuclear extracts prior to emsa
analysis in order to identify those  xxxg1559xxx  family members activated by cpg odn. results shown are representative of at least three experiments.

 xxxd2811xxx  ester was prepared by making up a 10 mm solution of commercially available gsh ethyl ester (sigma)
in pbs and treating it with 100 mm h2o2 for 1 hour. to
remove excess h2o2, the preparation was then incubated
with 10 u/ml catalase (sigma) for 1 hour. all reactions
were done at ambient temperature. residual h2o2 was
routinely found to be ,1 mm, as measured by the fox
assay (dringen et al., 1998).

raw 264.7 cells were plated at a density of 3 3 10
cells/ml in 60-mm tissue culture plates 48 hours prior to
transfection with an  xxxg1559xxx  reporter plasmid. the reporter plasmid consisted of a luciferase encoding gene
controlled by an  xxxg1559xxx -responsive promoter sequence
(yi et al., 1996b, 1998b) and was kindly provided by dr.
g. koretzky (university of pennsylvania). transfection
was accomplished by the use of lipofectamine plus
(gibco-brl, gaithersburg, md) per the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. transfected cells were
pooled and washed three times with culture medium.
treatment groups were drawn from a common pool of
cells transfected with the reporter plasmid. immediately
after the serum addition step of the transfection protocol,
raw 264.7 cells were treated with gsh-modulating
drugs and cpg dna and incubated for 24 hours, as described for il-6 cytokine elisa.  xxxg1559xxx  transcriptional
activity was assessed by measuring the luciferase activity
of cellular lysates and was normalized to lysate protein.
luciferase activity was quantified by measuring chemiluminescence in cell lysates, to which luciferin, atp, and
mg21 had been added, in a standard luciferase assay according to the manufacturer’s specifications.

hplc analysis of  xxxd2811xxx  ester
gsh ester was determined following derivatization
with n-(1-pyrenyl) maleimide using a 25-cm c18 reliasil column (column engineering, ontario, canada)
coupled with high performance liquid chromatography
(hplc) with fluorescent detection as previously described (ridnour et al., 1999).  xxxd2811xxx  ester was determined by incubation with a 10 m excess of dithiothreitol
(dtt) in pbs for 15 minutes at ambient temperature,
followed by derivatization with n-(1-pyrenyl) maleimide
and hplc separation as previously described (ridnour
et al., 1999). percent yield of  xxxd2811xxx  ester (from reactions
using h 2o2 oxidation of gsh ester) was calculated by
determining the area under the gsh ester peak before
and after reaction with h2o2 and then again after reduction of the product with a 10 m excess of dtt. the area
obtained after reduction of the  xxxd2811xxx  ester with dtt was
then divided by the area obtained from the gsh ester
prior to h2o2 oxidation and multiplied by 100 to obtain
percent yield of  xxxd2811xxx  ester from the reactions.

data were analyzed using sigmaplot 2000 for windows. all means were calculated from at least four separate experiments, and error bars represent standard errors
of the mean (sem). student’s t-test was used to determine the significance of differences at p , 0.05.

results
induction of ros production in cpg
dna-treated raw 264.7 cells
to investigate the production of ros by cpg s-odnstimulated cells, raw 264.7 cells were first incubated
with an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent dye, h2dcfda,
followed by stimulation with cpg s-odn 1826, noncpg s-odn 1982, 10 mm h2o2, 25 mm  xxxd2563xxx , or
10 ng/ml pma. as positive controls, pma efficiently induces the phagocytic respiratory burst in cell types expressing the classic phagocytic nadph oxidase complex, such as the raw 264.7 cell line, and h2o2 and
 xxxd2563xxx  provide known sources of peroxide and superoxide, respectively. cpg s-odn, but not non-cpg
s-odn, induced an approximately 30% increase in mea-

sured ros. as anticipated, positive controls, including
pma, h2o2, and  xxxd2563xxx , gave strong positive signals
with the cells loaded with h2dcfda (fig. 1). in addition, labeling control and cpg s-odn-treated cells with
the oxidation-insensitive analog of h2dcfda (dcfda)
did not show any alterations in fluorescence (fig. 1, inset), indicating that uptake, ester cleavage, and efflux of
the dye were not altered, and the differences seen with
the oxidation-sensitive dye could be attributed conclusively to alterations in prooxidant production.
to investigate the intracellular origin of the cpg-induced ros generation, raw 264.7 cells were stimulated with cpg s-odn in the presence or absence of several enzyme inhibitors. an inhibitor of flavoprotein
oxidoreductases, dpi abolished cpg-induced prooxidant
production (fig. 2). in contrast, neither an inhibitor of
 xxxg2431xxx  (allopurinol) nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration (rotenone) inhibited the increased
oxidation of h 2dcfda seen in the cpg odn-treated
cells. these results suggest that increased prooxidant
production was caused by the flavin-containing nadph
oxidase known to be activated by bacterial products in
cells of phagocytic origin.

raw 264.7 cells were incubated with the indicated inhibitors
for 30 minutes prior to the addition of cpg s-odn. concentrations of inhibitors used were: dpi, 10 mm; allopurinol, 100
mm; rotenone (rot), 5 mm. fluorescence measurements were
done as previously described. error bars represent the standard
error of five repeat experiments. *significant (p , 0.05) difference in ros production with respect to unstimulated cells.

perturbation of gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  redox state in
cpg-treated raw 264.7 cells
as cpg s-odn induced the monocyte/macrophage production of prooxidants, the hypothesis that this would lead
to changes in the intracellular gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  redox state was
tested. cells stimulated with cpg s-odn, but not noncpg s-odn, exhibited a significant decrease in total glutathione content (gsh 1  xxxd2811xxx ), expressed as nmol
gsx/mg cellular protein (fig. 3, top). additionally, cpg sodn-stimulated cells displayed a significant decrease in
the ratio of gsh/ xxxd2811xxx , indicative of a shift toward a more
oxidized intracellular redox state (fig. 3, bottom). consistent with the results in figure 2 showing an abrogation of
cpg-induced prooxidant production subsequent to dpi
treatment, dpi blocked the decrease in total glutathione
content and the decrease in the ratio of gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  seen on
cpg odn stimulation (fig. 4). inhibitors of  xxxg2431xxx  and mitochondrial respiration again failed to block
cpg-induced perturbations in glutathione redox state (data
not shown), suggesting that nadph oxidase activity was
causing the alterations in gsh/ xxxd2811xxx .

potentiation of cpg-induced alterations in
gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio by  xxxd444xxx  in raw 264.7 cells
inhibition of gr, the enzyme responsible for converting  xxxd2811xxx  to gsh, should lead to an increased level of
 xxxd2811xxx  after cpg treatment. to examine this hypothesis,
raw 264.7 cells were treated with  xxxd444xxx , an irreversible inhibitor of gr. consistent with the hypothesis,

332

kirsch et al.

 xxxd444xxx  should amplify the biologic effects of the cpg.
because cpg dna activates il-6 and  xxxg2296xxx  production
in raw 264.7 cells, we tested the sensitivity of this cytokine response to experimental manipulation of the
gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio with  xxxd444xxx . consistent with the hypothesis that  xxxd2811xxx  accumulation could stimulate cytokine release,  xxxd444xxx  treatment caused a dose-dependent
enhancement of cpg-induced il-6 (fig. 6, top) and
 xxxg2296xxx  (fig. 6, bottom) secretion. at the optimal  xxxd444xxx 
concentration of 30 mm, cpg-induced cytokine production was approximately doubled from that measured

indicated oxidants or s-odn in the following concentrations:
10 mm h2o2, 25 mm  xxxd2563xxx  (men), 2 mg/ml odn. after
30 minutes of stimulation, extracts of acid-soluble thiols were
made using 5% 5- xxxd3159xxx  (5-sa) and subjected to a modified tietze enzymatic recycling assay to measure total gsx. a
portion of each sample was treated with 2-vinylpyridine (2-vp)
to sequester reduced gsh and assayed as before for gsx. this
number is thus indicative of the [ xxxd2811xxx ] of the sample. the rate
of dtnb reduction produced in the tietze assay was measured
at 405 nm. error bars represent the standard error of five repeat
experiments. *significant (p , 0.05) difference with respect to
unstimulated cells.

30 mm  xxxd444xxx  pretreatment for 15 minutes led to a profound decrease in the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio in cpg-stimulated cells, as well as a modest decrease in total gsx,
when compared with cells treated with cpg odn in the
absence of  xxxd444xxx  (fig. 5).

suggest that enhancing the accumulation of  xxxd2811xxx  by inhibiting gr with  xxxd444xxx  in cells treated with cpg increased their ability to induce transcriptional activity of a

6.0 or 0.6 mg/ml 1826 s-odn (fig. 7, compare lane 3 to
lane 4 and lane 5 to lane 6, respectively). these results
are consistent with the hypothesis that increasing the
 xxxd2811xxx  content (and decreasing the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio) of
the cpg-stimulated raw 264.7 cells by inhibiting gr
with  xxxd444xxx  enhanced the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  dnabinding activity.

the increased formation of  xxxd2811xxx  by cpg-treated
cells exposed to the gr inhibitor,  xxxd444xxx , combined with
the enhancement of  xxxg1559xxx  dna-binding activity and
transcriptional activity, raised the question of whether
 xxxd2811xxx  accumulation is directly involved in stimulating
cpg-induced cell signaling. to address this question, we
chose to directly manipulate the intracellular  xxxd2811xxx  concentration in cpg-treated cells independent of prooxidant production. this was accomplished by incubating
cpg-stimulated cells with  xxxd2811xxx  ester so as to permit
free passage of  xxxd2811xxx  across the cell membrane while simultaneously inhibiting prooxidant production with dpi.

having evidence that modulation of the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx

the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  dna-binding activity, the next step was
to determine if  xxxg1559xxx -mediated transcriptional activity
was altered. to accomplish this goal, a luciferase reporter
system driven by an  xxxg1559xxx -specific promoter was used.

and methods and subjected to the same treatment (using
15 minutes preincubation with 30 mm  xxxd444xxx , followed
by cpg stimulation) as was used to investigate the secretion of il-6 (fig. 6). after 24 hours incubation with cpg,
the cells were harvested, and whole cell lysates were prepared. as shown in figure 8,  xxxg1559xxx -driven reporter activity was increased 5-fold in cells stimulated with cpg
dna and was increased approximately 10-fold in the

b,c,d), and the dtt peak is also visible at rt 5 20.3 minutes. overall, these results demonstrate that under these conditions, the
gsh ester was converted to  xxxd2811xxx  ester with .90% yield.

with excess dtt to reduce the disulfide bond found in

treatment converted the gsh ester into the  xxxd2811xxx  ester,
with a yield in excess of 90% based on the areas under
the peaks in figure 9b,d. to prevent gr-mediated conversion of  xxxd2811xxx  to gsh in cells treated with  xxxd2811xxx  ester, the cells were also pretreated with  xxxd444xxx .
in this protocol, the cells were first treated with a combination of 10 mm dpi, an inhibitor of nadph oxidase,
and 30 mm  xxxd444xxx  for 15 minutes, followed by drug

washout before stimulation with cpg dna. as shown in

cpg-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation, and neither alone is sufficient to induce the response. the addition of catalase
(240,000 kda) to the cultures did not block  xxxg1559xxx  activation, perhaps because it was too large to efficiently enter the cells (fig. 10, lane 4 vs. lane 5).

discussion
it has been suggested that intracellular ros are an
obligatory component of the signal transduction pathways activated by cpg dna (yi et al., 1996b, 1998b).
however, much remains to be determined with respect to
the mechanism by which cpg-induced ros are generated and exert their action on downstream targets. two
facts about the redox state of the intracellular glutathione
pools suggest that gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratios may be important to
ros-mediated signal transduction. the first is that the
redox state of the intracellular glutathione pool is thought
to be reflective of oxidative stress by virtue of gsh being
one of the major reducing buffers in the cell (schafer and
buettner, 2001). the second is that changes in the redox
state of thiols can functionally affect a number of proteins containing redox-labile cysteine residues required
for structure or function or both, including transcription
factors, such as  xxxg1559xxx  (baeuerle and henkel, 1994). in
the present studies, we sought to determine the importance of alterations in gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  redox states in cpginduced signal transduction. the data obtained indicate

that treatment with cpg odn decreases the total glutathione concentration in a cpg-responsive cell line,
raw 264.7, and shifts the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio to a more
oxidized redox state. further, augmenting the cpg-induced oxidative shift in gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio by inhibiting
gr with  xxxd444xxx  enhanced various cellular responses to
cpg stimulation. finally, increased intracellular  xxxd2811xxx 
appears to be necessary, but not sufficient, to mediate the
effects of cpg stimulation.
previous studies have demonstrated the cpg induced
generation of ros by various cpg-responsive cell types,
including murine splenocytes, murine b lymphoma cells,
and macrophagelike cell lines (yi et al., 1996b, 1998b).
furthermore, it has been suggested that cpg-induced
ros are required for downstream effects, as demonstrated by the ability of thiol antioxidants (pdtc and
nac) to block both observed intracellular ros generation and downstream effects, such as apoptosis protection
or cytokine secretion (yi and krieg, 1998a; yi et al.,
1996b, 1998b). the measurements of ros production by
cpg-stimulated raw 264.7 cells in the current report
indicate that cpg dna triggers the production of ros
comparable to that seen in other reported cpg-responsive cell types. as expected, production of ros was accompanied by gsh oxidation, as well as an overall loss
of total glutathione content (fig. 3). it must be noted,
however, that cpg dna-induced decreases in total glutathione have been observed only in macrophagelike cell
lines, as primary and transformed b cells appear not to
lose total glutathione, although they do undergo gsh oxidation (data not shown). the fate of the lost total glutathione is unknown at this time, but two possibilities are
the export of  xxxd2811xxx  by cpg-stimulated cells or the formation of glutathione containing mixed protein disulfides (gs-sp). curiously, the magnitude of the oxidative
shift in gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio on cpg stimulation was very
similar to that seen in response to stimuli capable of generating much larger ros-dependent signals in the dcf
assay (figs. 1 and 3). further studies will be required to
determine the biochemical mechanisms through which
cpg odn, induce these changes in intracellular
gsh/ xxxd2811xxx , but the data obtained using the inhibitor of
flavin containing oxidase enzymes (dpi) suggest that
these enzymes may play a major role.
the hypothesis that cpg-induced increases in  xxxd2811xxx 
(or decreases in the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio) might be a required component of the cpg dna signal transduction
pathway would predict that potentiating the cpg-induced production of  xxxd2811xxx  would lead to an increase in
downstream effects. in support of this hypothesis, treatment of cells with  xxxd444xxx , a potent irreversible inhibitor
of gr (schafer and buettner, 2001), the enzyme responsible for reducing  xxxd2811xxx  to gsh, increased accumulation
of  xxxd2811xxx  in response to cpg dna and enhanced the
cpg-dependent cytokine generation (figs. 5 and 6). in-

ros role in cpg dna signaling

terestingly, this enhanced responsiveness to cpg dna
was observed only when the cells were treated briefly (15
minutes) with lower doses (#30 mm) of  xxxd444xxx , followed by immediate removal of the drug. at higher doses
and longer treatment times or in the continued presence
of the drug, either no enhancement or a decrease in cytokine secretion was seen and was associated with toxicity
(fig. 6 and data not shown). the data with  xxxd444xxx  suggest that the  xxxd2811xxx -dependent step might take place early
in the cpg dna-induced signal transduction, as gr activity following inhibition with  xxxd444xxx  has been reported
to recover within 24 hours. however, these data cannot
formally exclude the possibility that  xxxd444xxx  could be acting through inhibition of  xxxg1826xxx  (schallreuter et al., 1990), which is also thought to modify the
redox state of thioredoxin, which in turn is known to
modify the redox state of the critical cysteine residues in
 xxxg1559xxx  (matthews et al., 1992).
a likely candidate for a downstream effector in gssgdependent cpg-induced signal transduction is the transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx .  xxxg1559xxx  is appreciated as being
activated by oxidative stress (sen and packer, 1996;
toledano and leonard, 1991) and has, in fact, been
shown to be activated in cpg-stimulated cells in a redoxdependent manner (yi and krieg, 1998a; yi et al., 1996b,
1998b). the potential significance of this is the fact that
 xxxg1559xxx  possesses cysteine residues in its dna-binding
domain, which must be in a reduced state to bind to its
consensus sequence (matthews et al., 1992). conversely,
reduced thiols (nac) have been shown to inhibit proteolysis mediated by the 26s proteosome complex that degrades i-kb (pajonk et al., 2002). these results suggest
that oxidizing conditions and the accumulation of  xxxd2811xxx 
could stimulate proteolysis of i-kb (possibly by mediating disulfide exchange reactions), leading to greater activation of  xxxg1559xxx . thus, oxidizing conditions in the cytosol and reducing conditions in the nucleus may both be
required for  xxxg1559xxx -mediated activation of transcription.
when treated in a fashion similar to that for the purpose of assessing cytokine production, raw 264.7 cells
exhibited increased amounts of  xxxg1559xxx  dna-binding activity in nuclear extracts prepared following 1 hour of
cpg stimulation (fig. 7) (stacey et al., 1996; yi et al.,
2001). it was possible that under the conditions imposed
by cpg-induced oxidative stress,  xxxg1559xxx  might translocate to the nucleus but be incapable of transactivation at
its promoter site, thus failing to contribute to cpg-induced transcription. this has been suggested to explain
why bolus doses of h2o2 are potent activators of  xxxg1559xxx ,
as judged by nuclear translocation, but are often relatively inefficient at inducing cytokine secretion. thus, it
was possible that  xxxg1559xxx  dna-binding activity could be
altered by cpg-induced changes in the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio
but fail to make a significant contribution to cpg-induced cytokine secretion. to address the possibility that

337

the observed  xxxd444xxx -dependent increases in  xxxg1559xxx  activation were of limited functional significance,  xxxg1559xxx  reporter assays were accomplished. by limiting the readout
of the experiment to the transcription of a protein (luciferase, in this case) driven solely by  xxxg1559xxx , we were able
to definitively demonstrate that  xxxg1559xxx -driven transcriptional activity does, in fact, increase in  xxxd444xxx -treated,
cpg-stimulated cells (fig. 8).
the subject of redox-dependent vs. redox-independent
mechanisms of  xxxg1559xxx  activation has been highly controversial (chandel et al., 2000; piette et al., 1997). the literature would seem to support both mechanisms, with
differences seeming to be both cell type and stimulus
specific (chandel et al., 2000). having demonstrated the
dependence on ros production, with concomitant  xxxd2811xxx 
formation, for elaboration of cpg-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation, we next wanted to determine if  xxxd2811xxx  could recapitulate the effects of cpg stimulation when ros production was inhibited. these experiments could also help
to determine if modulation of cpg-induced effects with
 xxxd444xxx  was mediated by inhibition of gr, leading to
 xxxd2811xxx  accumulation or inhibition of  xxxg1826xxx . to accomplish the goal of increasing  xxxd2811xxx  content
independent of increases in ros production,  xxxd2811xxx  ester
was used. neither gsh nor  xxxd2811xxx  can readily cross the
cell membrane because of charges present on the carboxy-termini of the gsh tripeptide, but esterified gsh
has been used to facilitate the entry of gsh into cells
(anderson et al., 1985). to determine if esterified  xxxd2811xxx 
would behave in a similar fashion, a solution of  xxxd2811xxx 
ester was prepared by treating gsh ester with h2o2, followed by incubation with 10 u/ml catalase. following
catalase treatment, the residual h2o2 of the preparation
was ,1 mm, and conversion of gsh ester to  xxxd2811xxx  ester
was confirmed (fig. 9). cells incubated with  xxxd2811xxx  ester
and  xxxd444xxx  (to prevent rapid reduction of the added
 xxxd2811xxx ) did not result in an increase in  xxxg1559xxx  dna-binding activity (fig. 10). these results indicate that increased intracellular  xxxd2811xxx  alone was insufficient for
 xxxg1559xxx  activation and that inhibition of  xxxg1826xxx  (or any other enzyme) by  xxxd444xxx  was insufficient
to cause  xxxg1559xxx  activation. likewise, cpg-induced increases in  xxxg1559xxx  dna-binding activity were prevented
in cells treated with dpi, which inhibits ros production
by flavin-containing oxidase enzymes (fig. 2). however,
on addition of  xxxd2811xxx  ester to dpi-treated cells stimulated
with cpg odn, complete restoration of  xxxg1559xxx  dnabinding activity was seen (fig. 10). these results support
the hypothesis that both cpg odn and  xxxd2811xxx  play
obligatory roles in the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  dna binding, whereas neither alone is sufficient. the nature of this
presumed cpg second signal is unclear at present but
might be related to the mitogen-activated protein kinases
(mapks) that are induced by cpg dna (yi and krieg,
1998b; hacker et al., 1998).

338

kirsch et al.

thus, the current data support a model where cpg
stimulation appears to work through two converging
pathways, one of which involves the accumulation of
 xxxd2811xxx . further work is needed to understand more completely the mechanisms responsible for the cpg-induced
perturbations in glutathione metabolism, particularly the
identity of the target immediately distal to the generation
of  xxxd2811xxx  that passes the redox signal to the  xxxg1559xxx  complex. changes in the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio appear to reflect a
redox shift in the cell that is important for mediating the
cpg activation, but this does not necessarily mean that
 xxxd2811xxx  specifically is the effector molecule. there has
been some suggestion in the literature that an oxidized
gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio can facilitate the formation of thioether
linkages between ubquitin and ubiquitin-activating enzyme, which is considered to be the rate-limiting step in
ubiquitination (shang et al., 1997; ramanathan et al.,
1999). because  xxxg1559xxx  activation ultimately requires the
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the inhibitory component, i-kb, this mechanism could provide
a link between accumulation of  xxxd2811xxx  and  xxxg1559xxx  activation (shang et al., 1997; ramanathan et al., 1999) seen
during cpg-induced stimulation.
