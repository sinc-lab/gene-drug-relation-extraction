abstract

some histamine h 1 receptor antagonists suppressed the inward current (iin) of an achatina identifiable neurone type, pon
(periodically oscillating neurone), caused by an achatina endogenous tetrapeptide having a o-phenylalanine residue, achatin-i
(gly- xxxd1793xxx -ala-asp), under voltage clamp. achatin-i was applied locally to the neurone by brief pneumatic pressure ejection
and antagonists were administered by perfusion. the dose-response curves of the effective histamine h 1 antagonists indicated
their potency order to suppress the iin as follows:  xxxd1667xxx , promethazine, triprolidine and homochlorcyclizine >
 xxxd2617xxx  and clemastine >  xxxd1910xxx . the potent drugs were mostly piperazine and phenothiazine types. the effects
of  xxxd1667xxx , promethazine and triprolidine on the dose (the duration of the pressure ejection)-response curve of achatin-i
indicated that these drugs affected the iin caused by achatin-i in a non-competitive manner. the antagonists for the receptors of
the small-molecule neurotransmitters other than histamine h1, such as histamine h 2, acetylcholine, y- xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba),  xxxd2431xxx , dopamine, a- and/3-adrenalin and 5-hydroxytryptamine, had no effect on the iin caused by achatin-i.

i. i n t r o d u c t i o n

a neuroexcitatory tetrapeptide having a o-phenylalanine residue (gly- xxxd1793xxx -ala-asp), termed achatin-i,
was isolated from the ganglia of an african giant snail
(achatina fulica f6russac). a m o n g achatin-i and its
stereoisomers, only achatin-i produced an inward current (iin) of the achatina identifiable giant neurones,
indicating that the excitatory effects are stereo-specific
for this peptide (kamatani et al., 1989). also, among
achatin-i and more than 20 compounds related to this
peptide, only achatin-i caused markedly the iin of
these neurones, indicating the effects to be structurespecific for this peptide (kim et al., 1991a). ten of the
23 achatina giant neurone types tested were excited by
achatin-i, but none was inhibited. we proposed that

this peptide is an excitatory neurotransmitter for these
neurones. the iin caused by this peptide was due to an
increase in the membrane permeability to na + (kim et
al., 1991b).
achatin-i in a low concentration enhanced the iin
caused by 5-hydroxytryptamine on the achatina giant
neurones, and suppressed the i in caused by oxytocin
and the outward current (iout) caused by a p g w - a m i d e
(ala-pro-gly- xxxd915xxx ), a tetrapeptide isolated from
the ganglia of a prosobranchia (fusinus ferrugineus)
(kuroki et al., 1990) and achatina fulica (liu et al.,
1991b). these findings suggested that achatin-i acts not
only as a neurotransmitter but also as a neuromodulator for the achatina giant neurones (liu and takeuchi,
1993a,b).
the aim of the present study was to determine the
blockers for the iin caused by achatin-i, using an
achatina giant neurone type, p o n (periodically oscillating neurone). after testing the effects of the drugs,
which have been considered to be the receptor antagonists for the small molecule neurotransmitters, such as

histamine h 1 and h2, acetylcholine, 7-aminobutyric
acid (gaba),  xxxd2431xxx , dopamine, a- and /3adrenalin and 5-hydroxytryptamine, we found that some
histamine h 1 receptor antagonists inhibited the i in of
this neurone type caused by achatin-i.

2. materials and methods
2.1. preparations

african giant snails (achatina fulica f6russac) were
brought by air from cebu and manila (philippines). a
giant neurone type identified in the suboesophageal
ganglia, pon (periodically oscillating neurone), was
used throughout the present experiments. localization
in the ganglia and sensitivities to the small-molecule
putative neurotransmitters and the neuroactive peptides of this neurone type were previously reported
(takeuchi et al., 1985, 1987; liu et al., 1991a). suboesophageal ganglia containing pon were dissected, and
incubated with 0.67% trypsin (type iii, sigma chemical, usa) for 5-10 min at room temperature (21 + i°c).
connective tissue covering the ganglia was removed
with fine forceps to denude pon. the ganglia were
then fixed on a sylgard layer by means of a suction
pipette and fine tungsten wires in an experimental
chamber of about 0.3 ml volume.
2.2. electrophysiological arrangements

the conventional voltage clamp technique using two
microelectrodes implanted into a neurone soma
(okamoto et al., 1976) was adopted. electrical resistances of the microelectrodes filled with 2 m potassium
acetate were 2-5 × 10 6 ,(2. membrane voltage was kept
at - 5 5 mv (holding voltage (vh)), near the resting
potential of the neurone type. the inward current (iin)
caused by achatin-i was recorded with a pen-writing
lecticorder, and stored on video tape using a videocorder via a signal converter.

(kyowa hakko kogyo, japan),  xxxd2637xxx  hydrochloride (organon international, netherlands) and propranolol hydrochloride (ici, uk). the following drugs
were obtained commercially:  xxxd1906xxx , carbinoxamine maleate,  xxxd3443xxx  hydrochloride,  xxxd3050xxx  maleate,  xxxd187xxx , (+)-chlorpheniramine maleate, (+)- xxxd375xxx  maleate,  xxxd2617xxx  hemi-(+)-tartrate,  xxxd1774xxx  hydrochloride,  xxxd1667xxx  hydrochloride, homochlorcyclizine dihydrochloride, triprolidine hydrochloride,  xxxd247xxx , bicuculline methiodide,

(cpp) and d-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid
(d- xxxd1353xxx ) (tocris neuramin, uk).
2.4. application methods

achatin-i was dissolved in snail physiological solution (takeuchi et al., 1973), and filled into a micropipette at 3 × 10 - 4 m together with 0.5% fast
green (sigma chemical). the tip of the micropipette
was placed near the neurone to be tested, and the root
was connected with polyethylene tubes to a nitrogen
cylinder via an electromagnetic valve. brief pneumatic
pressure ejection (mainly 2 × 105 pa and 400 ms in
duration) of the achatin-i solution, locally to the neurone to be tested, was performed by opening the valve
by current application.
to examine their suppressing effects on the i in
caused by achatin-i, these drugs were dissolved in
physiological solution  xxxd1891xxx  - 4 m for the screening
trials, and applied by perfusion into the experimental
chamber at a constant speed of 2.2 ml/min.
2.5. statistics

2.3. compounds used

synthetic achatin-i (gly-o-phe-ala-asp) was donated by dr. k. nomoto, of the suntory institute for
bioorganic research, japan. the following drugs were
also donated: doxepin hydrochloride (pfizer pharmaceutical, japan), promethazine hydrochloride (shionogi, japan),  xxxd1785xxx  (banyu
pharmaceutical, japan), cimetidine (smithkline
beecham seiyaku, japan), ranitidine hydrochloride
(nippon glaxo, japan),  xxxd2082xxx  (yamanouchi pharmaceutical, japan),  xxxd2744xxx  (eli lilly, usa),  xxxd3149xxx  (teikoku hormone mfg., japan),

the data obtained in the present study were expressed as means + s.e.m. in n trials. to compare the
two results obtained from a neurone, the two-tailed
student's t-test for paired data was performed. data
from repeated measurements on a neurone were analyzed by analysis of variance (anova) followed by
bonferroni's t-test (glantz, 1987). values were considered to be significantly different at p < 0.05.
the dose-response curves of a compound were analyzed by the probit method (litchfield and wilcoxon,
1949) using a computer program in order to obtain the
eds0 (the confidence limit at 95%), the ideal sigmoidal
curve (r value) and the hill coefficient (r value).

3.1. inward current (iin) caused by achatin-i

3.2. suppression of achatin-l-induced iin
receptor antagonists

local application of the endogenous tetrapeptide,
achatin-i, to an achatina neurone type, pon (periodically oscillating neurone), by brief pneumatic pressure
ejection (2 × 105 pa, 400 ms in duration, 3 x 10 - 4 m
and 10 min intervals) produced an inward c u r r e n t (lin)
of the neurone, 0.82 _+ 0.05 na (mean _ s.e.m.) (n =
60), in the physiological solution under voltage clamp.
the synaptic influences of the achatin-i effects, which
were observed sometimes after its bath application,
were prevented as far as possible with this way of
application.
the i in values caused by the achatin-i ejection in the
same manner were stable for at least 50 min. the
relation between the time course (min) and the current
(ha) was obtained from the linear regression as follows
(n = 10): y (na) = 0.88095 - 0.00257 x (min). n o n e of
the six results obtained for this time course was signifi-

the experimental chamber  xxxd1891xxx  - 4 m for the screening
trials, suppressed the iin of pon caused by brief pressure ejection of achatin-i. further, effective histamine
h 1 receptor antagonists were examined at various concentrations, 3 x 10 -5 m, 3 × 10 - 4 m and 10 -3 m, in
order to establish their dose-response curves. the classification of the histamine h 1 receptor antagonists
tested and their effects obtained in the present study

relation to those before drug perfusion (the control)
(fig. 3). the effective histamine h t receptor antagonists suppressed the iin in a dose-dependent manner.
the curves obtained were analyzed by the probit
method using a c o m p u t e r program. t h e eds0 of these
drugs and their confidence limits at 95% obtained in
this way are described in table 1.
t h e hill coefficient values of the drugs were also
calculated from these curves and were as follows: 0.3407
(r = 0.9992) for  xxxd1667xxx , 0.5384 (r = 0.9428) for
promethazine, 0.9382 ( r = 0.9822) for triprolidine,
0.9099 (r = 0.9980) for homochlorcyclizine, 0.4974 (r =
0.9480) for  xxxd2617xxx , 0.7632 (r = 0.9872) for
clemastine and 0.5308 (r = 0.9828) for  xxxd1910xxx .
3.4. effects o f histamine h 1 receptor antagonists on dose
(duration o f pressure ejection)-response curve o f achatin-i
the dose (duration of pressure ejection)-response
curve of achatin-i was measured by varying the duration of the brief pressure ejection (105 pa, 3 × 10 -4 m,
5 min intervals), from 30 ms to 500 ms, instead of
changing the concentration. the synaptic influences of
the achatin-i effects were thus minimized. in the con-

 xxxd3105xxx  experiments, the dose (pressure duration)-response
curves of achatin-i were measured in this manner in
the physiological solution twice (first and second control curves) from one p o n without any drug, using a
30-min interval between the end of the first control
curve and the start of the second control curve (n = 8).
the eds0 (confidence limit at 95%), the hill coefficient (r value) and the e m a x (measured at 400 ms in
duration) (mean + s.e.m.) were 51.2 ms (25.0-78.9
ms), 1.5466 ( r = 0.9580) and 0.95 + 0.12 na, respectively, for the first control curve; and 56.6 ms (2.7-131.1
ms), 1.2117 (r = 0.8952) and 0.94 + 0.14 na for the
second control curve. it was confirmed by student's
t-test for paired data that no iin of the second control
curve was significantly different (ns) from those obtained with the same pressure durations in the first
control curve (fig. 4a). therefore, it was concluded
that the two dose (pressure duration)-response curves
of achatin-i, the one in the physiological solution (control curve) and the other with a drug (test curve), could
be measured from one pon.
the effects of the three effective histamine h 1 receptor antagonists,  xxxd1667xxx , promethazine and

3.5. effects of drugs other than histamine h 1 receptor
antagonists
the effects of the following drugs, which were recognized as the receptor antagonists for the small
molecule neurotransmitters, other than histamine h 1
receptor antagonists, on the i in of pon caused by
achatin-i, were also examined: histamine h 2 receptor
antagonists (cimetidine, ranitidine,  xxxd2082xxx ,  xxxd2744xxx  and  xxxd3149xxx ), acetylcholine receptor antagonists
(atropine and d- xxxd3456xxx ), gaba receptor antagonists (bicuculline and pitrazepin), l- xxxg981xxx  antagonists (3-(( + )-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-

the present study forms part of an ongoing research
program of serial investigations on the effects of
achatin-i, an achatina endogenous tetrapeptide having
a  xxxd1793xxx  residue (kamatani et al., 1989; kim
et al., 1991a,b; liu and takeuchi, 1993a,b). in the
course of these investigations, some histamine h 1 receptor antagonists were found to suppress the ii, of an
achatina neurone type, pon, caused by achatin-i,
though the receptor antagonists for other small
molecule neurotransmitters showed no effect. the eds0
of the effective histamine h t receptor antagonists,
found from their dose-response curves to suppress the
i in caused by achatin-i, indicated a potency order as
follows:  xxxd1667xxx  (piperazine type), promethazine
(phenothiazine type), triprolidine (other type) and homochlorcyclizine (piperazine type) >  xxxd2617xxx 
(phenothiazine type) and clemastine (aminoalkylether
type) >  xxxd1910xxx  (aminoalkylether type). the
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonists showing these
marked effects were mostly piperazine and phenothiazine types.
less than half the histamine h 1 receptor antagonists tested suppressed the i in caused by achatin-i,
making it unlikely that these drugs affected the
achatin-i receptors which were pharmacologically similar to those of histamine h r further, achatin-i produced markedly the iin of pon, whereas histamine
had almost no effect on this neurone type (takeuchi et
al., 1985, 1987). thus, histamine cannot be an agonist
of achatin-i for pon.
the dose (duration of pressure ejection)-response
curves of achatin-i showed that the three effective
histamine h 1 receptor antagonists,  xxxd1667xxx ,
promethazine and triprolidine, markedly lowered the
emax of this peptide, but did not shift significantly its
eds0. this indicates that these drugs affected the i in
caused by achatin-i in a non-competitive manner. based
on these findings, it is considered that these drugs
suppressed the achatin-i-induced iin by modifying the
features of the achatin-i receptors, by blocking the
na + channels for the achatin-i effects (kim et al.,
1991a), or by affecting the intracellular signalling
mechanisms linked with the peptide effects. it was
