abstract
thionamides, inhibitors of the  xxxg2320xxx -mediated
iodination, are clinically used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. however, the use of antithyroid drugs is associated
with immunomodulatory effects, and recent studies with
thionamide-related heterocyclic thioderivates demonstrated
direct anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties.
using primary human t-lymphocytes, we show that the heterocyclic thionamides  xxxd435xxx  and  xxxd3036xxx  inhibit synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)␣ and interferon (ifn)␥. in addition, dna
binding of nuclear factor (nf)-␬b, a proinflammatory transcription factor that regulates both tnf␣ and ifn␥ synthesis,
and nf-␬b-dependent reporter gene expression were reduced.
abrogation of nf-␬b activity was accompanied by reduced

thioureylenes containing a thionamide group are the most
widely used drugs to treat hyperthyroidism, a wide-spread
disease commonly caused by raised circulating levels of
 xxxg2320xxx  antibodies and increased levels of serum  xxxd3368xxx  (farwell and braverman, 1996). antithyroid thionamide treatment inhibits the
 xxxg2320xxx  and reduces excessive thyroid hormone
synthesis (farwell and braverman, 1996). furthermore,
the application of thionamides has been implicated with
immune suppression characterized by  xxxg1338xxx  inhibition, diminished antigen presentation, reduced release
of proinflammatory mediators, t-cell abnormalities, and

phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of inhibitor of ␬b
(i␬b)␣, the inhibitory subunit of the nf-␬b complex.  xxxd435xxx  inhibited nf-␬b via the small gtpase  xxxg1921xxx , whereas
 xxxd3036xxx  inhibited the phosphorylation of i␬b␣ by its
kinase inhibitor of ␬b kinase ␣.  xxxd2594xxx  had no effect on
nf-␬b induction, demonstrating that drug potency correlated
with the chemical reactivity of the thionamide-associated sulfur
group. taken together, our data demonstrate that thioureylenes
with a common, heterocyclic structure inhibit inflammation and
immune function via the nf-␬b pathway. our results may explain the observed remission of proinflammatory diseases upon
antithyroid therapy in hyperthyroid patients. the use of related
thioureylenes may provide a new therapeutic basis for the
development and application of anti-inflammatory compounds.

decreased  xxxg1175xxx  expression (volpé, 2001; bandyopadhyay et al., 2002; pearce, 2004). in hyperthyroid patients, thionamide treatment has been associated with
protection from chronic and pathological inflammation
(dagia et al., 2004; elias, 2004), autoimmune disorders
(singer et al., 1994; mozes et al., 1998), and hypertrophic
or inflammatory heart disease (hardiman et al., 1997).
the aberrant activation of the transcription factor nuclear
factor (nf)-␬b is involved in chronic and pathological inflammation, autoimmunity, sepsis, and heart disease (kumar et
al., 2004), arguing that this transcription factor might participate in thionamide-mediated side effects. in most cell
types, nf-␬b is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the i␬b
family of proteins (karin and delhase, 2000). after  xxxg1921xxx  and
i␬b-kinase (ikk) activation, i␬b proteins become phosphorylated, ubiquitinilated, and degraded by the proteasome (karin and delhase, 2000; marinari et al., 2002; piccolella et al.,

materials and methods
isolation and treatment of human primary t-lymphocytes.
peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified by  xxxd3253xxx -paque plus
(ge healthcare, chalfont st. giles, buckinghamshire, uk) centrifugation of whole blood. t-cells were enriched by immunomagnetic
cell sorting with  xxxd2676xxx  microbeads using ls⫹ selection columns
(miltenyi biotech, auburn, ca). isolated cells were suspended in rpmi
1640, supplemented with 10 mm hepes, ph 7.3, 50 ␮m ␤- xxxd26xxx , and 2 mm l-glutamine. cell suspensions were pretreated with
 xxxd2594xxx  (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo),  xxxd3036xxx  (sigmaaldrich), or  xxxd435xxx  (lkt laboratories, st. paul, mn) at indicated
concentrations. t-lymphocytes were activated by cd3/cd28 cross-linking with t cell expander dynabeads (dynal biotech, lake success, ny)
or 15 ng/ml phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (sigma-aldrich).
cytokine elisa. cytokine concentrations in supernatants of 2 ⫻
106 primary human t-lymphocytes were analyzed using the human
tnf-␣ or ifn␥ quantikine immunoassay (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn). cells were seeded at 107 t-cells/ml and preincubated with
various concentrations (0.1–5 mm) of thionamides in different wells
of a 96-well round bottom plate (greiner bio-one gmbh, frickenhausen, germany). t-cells were induced by 106 t-cell expander
dynabeads 2 h after the onset of thionamide treatment. after 15 h,
supernatants were collected, diluted 1:5 in assay diluent, and the
tnf-␣ or ifn␥ concentration was determined according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
nf-␬b-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression.
jurkat cells were transiently transfected with 2 ␮g of pnf-␬b-luc
(clontech, mountain view, ca) using lipofectamine2000 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. transfection reactions were pooled, redistributed at 105 cells/
well, and incubated with thionamides and 15 ng/ml phorbol 12myristate 13-acetate for 15 h. luciferase reporter gene expression
was measured by harvesting cells in 100 ␮l of luciferase reporter

lysis buffer (promega, madison, wi) and assaying in a microluminat
plus lb 96p luminometer (berthold technologies, bad wildbach,
germany). protein levels were normalized by the bio-rad protein
assay (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca).
elisa-based nf-␬b transcription factor activity assay.
nuclear extracts were analyzed by the transam nf-␬b family transcription factor activation assay according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations (active motif, carlsbad, ca). nf-␬b complexes
were captured by binding to a consensus 5⬘-gggactttcc-3⬘ oligonucleotide immobilized on a 96-well plate. the contend of bound
nf-␬b was determined by different primary antibodies, detecting
p50 or p65 proteins followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit igg for spectrophotometric detection at
od450 nm. data were expressed as a percentage of nf-␬b/dna
binding compared with activated cells (⫽100%).
nuclear protein extraction and electrophoretic mobility
shift assays. preparation of nuclear cell extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assays was performed as described previously
(loop et al., 2002). for dna binding, the nf-␬b motif 5⬘-agttgaggggactttcccaggc-3⬘ was used as a probe. binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min in a volume of
20 ␮l containing 20 ␮g of nuclear cell extract, 22 mm hepes, ph 7.9,
70 mm kcl, 50 ␮m edta, 2.2 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, 4%
 xxxd3253xxx , 0.1% nonidet p40, 30 ␮m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20
␮g of bovine  xxxg124xxx , 2 ␮g of poly(di-dc), and 1.75 pmol 32p
end-labeled oligonucleotides (5 ␮ci/pmol). the resulting dna complexes were displayed by electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturating
polyacrylamide gels and subsequent autoradiography.
i␬b␣: phosphorylation and degradation. primary human
cd3⫹ t-lymphocytes were preincubated at 2 ⫻ 106 t-cells/well with
various concentrations (0.1–5 mm) of thionamides for 4 h. in addition, lymphocytes were exposed to 10 ␮m mg132 (calbiochem, san
diego, ca) for measurement of i␬b␣ phosphorylation and 5 ␮g/ml
 xxxd1800xxx  d (sigma-aldrich) for measurement of i␬b␣ degradation. cd3/cd28 receptor stimulation was induced by 106 t-cell expander dynabeads for the last 20 min (i␬b␣ phosphorylation) or 10
min (i␬b␣ degradation) of the experiment. reactions were terminated by the addition of 30 ␮l of 3⫻ sds sample buffer and boiling.
proteins were separated by 10% sds-page gels. immunoblots were
analyzed with 0.1 ␮g/ml of a phosphospecific i␬b␣(ser32) antibody
(new england biolabs, ipswich, ma) or 0.1 ␮g/ml of an i␬b␣(total)
antibody (new england biolabs). ␤-actin was recognized by 20 ng/ml
of a ␤-actin antibody (new england biolabs). specific bands were
visualized using secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ge healthcare).
in vitro kinase assay. t-lymphocytes were lysed for 20 min at
4°c in a volume of 600 ␮l of kinase buffer (20 mm hepes, 2 mm
dithiothreitol, 10 mm naf, 1 mm na3vo4, 10 mm ␤-glycerophosphate, 0.5% nonidet p-40, 20 ␮g/ml aprotinin, 20 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 1
␮g/ml pepstatin a, and 0.2 ␮g/ml  xxxd502xxx ). for the kinase reaction,
100 ␮l of cell lysate, 2 ␮g of gst-i␬b␣-sepharose beads (santa cruz
biotechnology, santa cruz, ca), and 0.5 ␮mol atp were incubated
for 2 h at 30°c. in subsequent experiments, gst-i␬b␣-sepharose
beads were repeatedly washed by kinase buffer and analyzed for
phospho-i␬b␣ (ser32) or total i␬b␣ by immunoblotting.
in alternative experiments, ikk␣ proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with 2 ␮g of anti-ikk␣ antibody-sepharose
beads (santa cruz biotechnology) for 1 h at 4°c under constant
rotation. the precipitates were washed four times in kinase buffer.
kinase reactions were performed for 20 min at 22°c in 20 ␮l of
kinase buffer containing 10 ␮m atp, 5 ␮ci of [␥-32p]atp, and 4 ␮g
of gst-i␬b␣ (santa cruz biotechnology) for each immunoprecipitate. reactions were terminated by addition of 5⫻ sds loading
buffer and separated by 10% sds-page. gels were fixed, dried, and
analyzed by autoradiography.
analysis of g-proteins.  xxxg1921xxx  activity was determined by the
rac activation assay kit (cytoskeleton, denver, co). in brief, 2 ⫻ 107
t-cells were harvested and lysed in 300 ␮l of ice-cold extraction

2003). in subsequent experiments, nf-␬b proteins translocate to the nucleus to bind their cognate dna sequences and
to initiate transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, enzymes, and antimicrobial
peptides.
we recently described thiobarbiturates as potent inhibitors
of ikks, nf-␬b, and proinflammatory cytokine production
(loop et al., 2002, 2003). although thiobarbiturates and thionamides have different clinical utilities, both are thioureylenes with a related structure and overlapping cellular activities. thus, thiobarbiturates reduce thyroid function (farwell
and braverman, 1996) and inhibit adaptive and cellular immune responses (corrêa-sales et al., 1997; nishina et al.,
1998).
in the present study, we investigated whether thionamides,
comparable with the structurally related barbiturates, impede
immune functions by a general, structure-dependent mechanism. in this study, we demonstrated that thionamides inhibited the activation of the transcription factor nf-␬b, which
might be responsible for the remission of some immune-related
diseases observed during antithyroid treatment of patients.
comparable with thiobarbiturates, we found that  xxxd3036xxx  inhibited the ikk-dependent phosphorylation of i␬b␣,
whereas  xxxd435xxx  repressed the proximal gtpase  xxxg1921xxx .
the biological effects were mediated by redox-active sulfur of
thionamides. because thioureylenes affect ubiquitously expressed proteins that regulate important cellular responses in
health and disease, the development of new pharmaceutical
compounds on a mononuclear heterocyclic thioureylene basis as
key building blocks in medicinal chemistry may evolve.

thionamides inhibited the proinflammatory cytokine synthesis. because clinical observations suggest antiinflammatory properties, the heterocyclic thioureylenes  xxxd2594xxx ,  xxxd3036xxx , and  xxxd435xxx  were analyzed
for their ability to inhibit cytokine production (fig. 1). secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines il-1, tnf␣, and ifn␥
was measured in supernatants of primary human t-lymphocytes by elisa. cd3/cd28 receptor cross-linking induced
tnf␣ and ifn␥ secretion (fig. 2, a and b). in contrast, il-1,
a cytokine primarily secreted by mononuclear phagocytes,
could not be detected in human t lymphocyte supernatants
(data not shown). preincubation with either  xxxd3036xxx

several transcription factors participate in the transcription of tnf␣ and ifn␥. to demonstrate that the central
mediator of proinflammatory cytokine synthesis is nf-␬b,
specific inhibitors of the proinflammatory nf-␬b pathway
were used (fig. 2c). the proteasome inhibitors mg132 and
lactacystin, which block i␬b␣ degradation, significantly suppressed cytokine synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (fig.
2c). in addition, 25 mm of the antioxidant  xxxd68xxx ,
an inhibitor of the i␬b kinases, repressed cytokine synthesis
but was associated with cytotoxicity (data not shown). we
observed that nf-␬b inhibitors were more potent inhibitors
of tnf␣ than of ifn␥ production. in addition,  xxxd3036xxx  repressed tnf␣ secretion at lower doses than ifn␥ (fig.

similar mechanism, nf-␬b-dependent reporter gene expression studies (fig. 3) and nf-␬b dna-binding assays were
performed (fig. 4).
to determine nf-␬b-dependent gene expression, jurkat
t-cells were transiently transfected with a reporter construct
containing the firefly luciferase gene under the control of
nf-␬b (fig. 3). nf-␬b activity was induced by phorbol 12myristate 13-acetate because cd3/cd28 signaling was defective in jurkat cells (m. humar, unpublished observation).
upon activation, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of
nf-␬b controlled reporter gene expression in jurkat cells
when they were preincubated with thionamides (fig. 3). preincubation with either  xxxd3036xxx  or  xxxd435xxx  significantly reduced reporter gene activity, whereas  xxxd2594xxx 
treatment resulted in only a minor and statistically insignificant decline of luciferase expression.
nf-␬b is composed of homo- and heterodimeric complexes
of various nf-␬b family members. however, the p50/p65
heterodimers are the most common dimers found in the
nf-␬b signaling pathways. therefore, dna binding of p50
and p65(rela) was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift
assay using nuclear extracts of cd3/cd28-activated t-cells
(fig. 4a). the position and specificity of p50 and p65(rela)
was identified by supershift and competition experiments on
independent blots (data not shown). the dna-binding activity of nf-␬b was significantly impaired by preincubation
with either  xxxd3036xxx  or  xxxd435xxx . in contrast,  xxxd2594xxx  did not affect p50 or p65(rela) binding to its corresponding dna consensus sequence.
for quantification of p50 or p65(rela) dna binding, an
elisa-based dna-binding assay was used. results in fig.
4b displayed a minor dna-binding activity of p50 and p65(rela) to a (5⬘-gggactttcg-3⬘) dna consensus sequence
in resting t-cells. this was induced two to four times upon
cd3/cd28 t-cell receptor stimulation. the presence of  xxxd2594xxx  did not significantly alter dna binding. in contrast, preincubation with either  xxxd3036xxx  or  xxxd435xxx  dose-dependently inhibited binding of p50 or p65 to its
correspondent dna consensus sequence.

fig. 4.  xxxd435xxx  and  xxxd3036xxx  inhibit dna binding of nf␬b. cd3⫹ t cells were treated for 3 h with thionamides at the indicated concentrations and subsequently stimulated by cd3/cd28 t-cell
receptor cross-linking for 30 min (107 t-cell expander dynabeads/
assay). in a, nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed for dna
binding of p50 or p65(rela) by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
nf-␬b dna complexes, the nonspecific binding activity of the probe
(ⴱ), and unbound oligonucleotides (⬎) are indicated. in b, for quantification of dna-bound nf-␬b, a plate-immobilized oligonucleotide
containing a 5⬘-gggactttttcc-3⬘ nf-␬b binding site was used.
nf-␬b members were recognized by specific anti-p50 or antip65(rela) antibodies and secondary horseradish peroxidase-immune
complexes for colorimetric readout. spectrophotometric data were expressed as a percentage of induction by absorbance compared with
activated cells (⫽100%). error bars, median ⫾ s.e.m. of six independent experiments. ⴱ, p ⬍ 0.05 versus positive controls was considered

p50 and p65(rela) nf-␬b subunits.

anti-inflammatory potential of thioureylenes

fig. 5.  xxxd435xxx  and  xxxd3036xxx  inhibit the phosphorylation and
degradation of i␬b␣. cd3⫹ t cells were treated for 3 h with thionamides
at the indicated concentrations. cd3/cd28 t-cell receptor cross-linking
was induced for 20 min to detect phosphorylation or 10 min to detect i␬b␣
degradation (106 t-cell expander dynabeads/assay). total cellular lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. in a, both,  xxxd3036xxx  and
 xxxd435xxx  inhibited i␬b␣ phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas  xxxd2594xxx  had no effect. analysis of total i␬b␣ protein
demonstrated equal amounts of protein in each lane because i␬b␣ degradation was inhibited during thionamide treatment and t-cell activation by addition of 10 ␮m of the proteasome inhibitor mg132. in b, effects
of thionamides on i␬b␣ degradation are demonstrated (top blot). to
inhibit protein synthesis, thionamide treatment and cd3/cd28 t-cell
receptor stimulation were performed in the presence of 5 ␮g/ml  xxxd1800xxx  d but in the absence of mg132. total cell lysate supernatants were
analyzed for ␤-actin to demonstrate that equal amounts of protein were
included (bottom blot). representatives of three independent experiments are shown.

tion with  xxxd3036xxx  or  xxxd435xxx  abolished i␬b␣ proteolysis. these results demonstrated that thionamides inhibit the phosphorylation and degradation of i␬b, preserving
nf-␬b in an inactive state. the low amount of i␬b␣ protein
detected in quiescent cells (fig. 5b, lane 1) has been observed
before (henkel et al., 1992).
in previous experiments, we have shown that thiobarbiturates inhibit the phosphorylation and the proteasomal degradation of i␬b␣ by a repression of ikks (loop et al., 2003).
to analyze whether thionamides mediate similar effects due
to their related structure, ikk activity was examined in the
presence of  xxxd2594xxx ,  xxxd3036xxx , and  xxxd435xxx .
t-cells contain multiple different ikk complexes (kupfer and
scheinman, 2002). therefore, the overall ikk activity was
determined by a kinase activity assay using total cytosolic
extracts of activated t cells and immobilized recombinant
gst-i␬b␣ as a substrate. ikk-specific phosphorylation was
measured by an i␬b␣ (ser32/ser36) phosphospecific antibody
and by immunoblotting (fig. 6a). a small amount of phospho-i␬b␣ was detected when lysates, derived from quiescent
t-lymphocytes, were used. however, cd3/cd28 activation
resulted in a marked increase in phosphorylated gst-i␬b␣.
pretreatment of t-cells with  xxxd3036xxx  or  xxxd435xxx 
prevented i␬b␣ ser32 and ser36 phosphorylation, indicating
a reduced ikk activity, whereas  xxxd2594xxx  treatment had
no effect.  xxxd435xxx  was more potent in inhibiting ikks
than  xxxd3036xxx  (fig. 6a).
to determine the specific i␬b-kinase␣ activity, ikk␣ was

fig. 6.  xxxd435xxx  and  xxxd3036xxx  inhibit the i␬b-kinase activity.
kinase activity assays are shown. primary human t-lymphocytes (2 ⫻
107) were pretreated with thionamides for 2 h and stimulated with 0.5
cd3/cd28 t-cell expander dynabeads/cell for 10 min. in a, total cell
lysates were prepared and incubated with 2 ␮g of gst-i␬b␣-sepharose
beads plus 0.5 ␮mol atp to perform an i␬b␣ kinase reaction at 30°c for
2 h. phosphorylation of i␬b␣ at ser32 and ser36 were visualized by
immunoblotting (top blot). reprobed blots using an anti-gst-specific
antibody demonstrated equal amounts of gst-i␬b␣ substrate in each
reaction (input control, middle blot). total cell lysates contained equal
amounts of ikk␣ (bottom blot). in b, ikk␣-specific i␬b␣ phosphorylation
is demonstrated. ikk␣ was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates by
2 ␮g of antibody-sepharose beads. immunoprecipitates were incubated
with 4 ␮g of gst-i␬b␣ kinase substrate, 10 ␮m atp, and 5 ␮ci
[␥-32p]atp for 20 min at 22°c.  xxxd435xxx - or  xxxd3036xxx -treated
cells demonstrated a dose-dependent decline of ikk␣-specific kinase activity (top blots). western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates demonstrated equal amounts of ikk␣ in each kinase reaction (input control,
bottom blots).

repression of nf-␬b was due to inhibition of i␬b
phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation by reduced i␬b-kinase activity. the reason for reduced nf-␬b/
dna binding was analyzed. in most cell types, nf-␬b exists
in an inactive form in the cytoplasm, bound to inhibitory i␬b
proteins. phosphorylation and proteolytic cleavage of i␬b
result in the release and nuclear translocation of nf-␬b and
in specific gene activation (li and verma, 2002). therefore,
we investigated whether thionamides impair the phosphorylation (fig. 5a) and degradation (fig. 5b) of i␬b␣ proteins.
because the phosphorylated form of i␬b␣ is highly transient
and difficult to detect due to rapid proteasomal degradation,
the proteasome inhibitor mg132 was added (fig. 5a). cd3/
cd28 receptor stimulation of t-lymphocytes induced the
phosphorylation of i␬b␣ proteins as determined by immunoblotting (fig. 5a). preincubation with  xxxd3036xxx  or
 xxxd435xxx  prevented the cd3/cd28-induced phosphorylation of i␬b␣, whereas  xxxd2594xxx  had no effect. reduced
levels of i␬b␣ phosphorylation were not attributed to proteolysis because mg132 efficiently blocked proteasomal degradation. equal amounts of total i␬b␣ proteins could be detected in each reaction (fig. 5a, bottom blots).
in the absence of mg132, i␬b␣ was readily degraded upon
cd3/cd28 t-cell receptor stimulation (fig. 5b). preincuba-

immunoprecipitated from cytosolic extracts. in subsequent
experiments, immunoprecipitates were incubated with gsti␬b␣ and [32p]atp. because  xxxd2594xxx  had no major effect on the cd3/cd28-induced increase in total ikk activity,
only the effects of  xxxd435xxx  and  xxxd3036xxx  were
tested. basal ikk␣ activity was low in quiescent cd3⫹
t-cells, whereas stimulation of the cd3/cd28 receptor
caused an increase in ikk activity (fig. 6b). however, ikk␣
activity remained at the level of the nonstimulated controls
when cells were pretreated with  xxxd3036xxx  (5 mm) or
 xxxd435xxx  (1 mm) before cd3/cd28 cross-linking. this
observation indicated that thionamides inhibited the activity
of ikk␣. the amount of recovered ikk␣ protein was comparable under all conditions (fig. 6b, bottom blots).
 xxxd435xxx - but not  xxxd3036xxx -mediated
repression of ikk activity was due to inhibition of
the small g-protein  xxxg1921xxx . t-cell receptor-mediated t-cell
activation is induced by a supramolecular activation complex
referred to as the immunological synapse (schmitz et al.,
2003). because activation of the immunological synapse
leads to the induction of nf-␬b, a suppression of signal
transmission via the t-cell receptor might explain the inhibition of ikks. however, antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots
of total cell lysates displayed no fundamental decrease in
activating tyrosine phosphorylation after cd3/cd28 receptor
stimulation and thionamide treatment (fig. 7a). in fact,
 xxxd435xxx  induced a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at 70 kda (fig. 7a, arrows). subsequent
experiments revealed that  xxxg2438xxx /syk protein  xxxg2198xxx  was a target of  xxxd435xxx -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. increased phosphorylation of  xxxg2438xxx /syk was
accompanied by an increased kinase activity. vav-1, a direct
substrate of  xxxg2438xxx , was also hyperphosphorylated at tyrosine 160 (fig. 7b) in the presence of  xxxd435xxx .
vav-1 acts as a gdp/gtp exchange factor for the small
gtpase  xxxg1921xxx  (crespo et al., 1997) and thus integrates t-cell
receptor and cd28-derived signals with the activation of
nf-␬b via a  xxxg1921xxx /mlk3/ikk or  xxxg1921xxx /mekk1/ikk-dependent pathway. to analyze whether thionamides block  xxxg1921xxx 
and thereby mediate the repression of ikks and nf-␬b, the
activity of  xxxg1921xxx  was determined in the cytosol of activated
cells using immobilized p21-activated kinase 1-p21 binding
domain as a binding partner for pull-down experiments.
upon cd3/cd28 t-cell receptor stimulation, inactive rac1(gdp) was converted to active  xxxg1921xxx (gtp) as demonstrated
by its ability to complex with its binding partner pak (fig.
7c). only  xxxd435xxx , but not  xxxd2594xxx  or  xxxd3036xxx , repressed the ability of  xxxg1921xxx  to bind the  xxxg1377xxx  pak.
the  xxxd435xxx -mediated inhibition of  xxxg1921xxx  was more
closely investigated. activation of  xxxg1921xxx  by gtp␥s is independent of regulatory events by associated signaling cascades. as a result, inhibition of  xxxg1921xxx /pak binding must be
direct. indeed, gtp␥s-activated cell lysates showed a direct
repression of  xxxg1921xxx /pak binding upon  xxxd435xxx  treatment
(fig. 7c, bottom blot). in contrast, phosphorylation of  xxxg1921xxx 
at ser71 that both inhibits gtp-binding and activation of the
small g protein (kwon et al., 2000) was not responsible for
the inhibitory potential of  xxxd435xxx  (fig. 7b). in addition,
isoprenylation that is essential for membrane association
and biological function of  xxxg1921xxx  (didsbury et al., 1990) was
not involved in  xxxd435xxx -mediated effects because

inhibits activation of the small gtpase  xxxg1921xxx . immunoblots are shown. t
cells were pretreated with thionamides for 3 h and stimulated with 0.5
cd3/cd28 t-cell expander dynabeads/cell for 10 min as indicated. in a,
protein phosphorylation was detected by an antiphosphotyrosine (4g10)
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody using whole-cell lysates. ⬍, position of increased tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of  xxxd435xxx .
in alternative experiments, tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg2438xxx /syk,  xxxg1921xxx ,
and vav-1 was analyzed by protein-specific antibodies (b). as a loading
control, antibodies directed against total  xxxg1921xxx ,  xxxg2438xxx , and vav-1 were
used to demonstrate equal amounts of protein in each lane. in c, the effect
of thionamides on  xxxg1921xxx  activity was determined by a pak pull-down assay.
active rac was pulled down from whole cellular lysates with gst-pak prb
fusion proteins. precipitated proteins (top panels) show the active fraction of
the gtpase, whereas the bottom panels show the total amount of  xxxg1921xxx  in
each cell lysate fraction. gtp␥s was used for direct activation of  xxxg1921xxx  in
cellular lysates, in the absence of cd3/cd28 t-cell receptor coactivation
(final blots). representatives of three independent experiments are shown.

anti-inflammatory potential of thioureylenes

gtp␥s-dependent  xxxg1921xxx  activation does not require a specific subcellular protein localization (fig. 7c, bottom blot). in
contrast, both  xxxd2594xxx  and  xxxd3036xxx  did not influence the gtp␥s-dependent activation of  xxxg1921xxx  as observed
in pull-down experiments before, using cd3/cd28-activated
t-cells (fig. 7c). in summary,  xxxd435xxx  directly inhibits
 xxxg1921xxx  and thus demonstrates another inhibitory profile than
heterocyclic thioderivates with a pyrimidine-like nucleus
(fig. 8).

discussion

fig. 8. effects of heterocyclic thioderivates on t-cell receptor-dependent
nf-␬b activation are shown. t-cell activation involves a supramolecular
activation complex (immunological synapse) and is mediated by tyrosine
phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions. vav-1, a direct substrate of  xxxg2438xxx  and a gdp/gtp exchange factor of the small gtpase
 xxxg1921xxx , is induced by tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to the activation of
the transcription factor nf-␬b by a  xxxg1921xxx /mlk-3/ikk or a  xxxg1921xxx /
mekk1/ikk-dependent pathway.  xxxd435xxx , a sulfur derivate of imidazole, directly inhibits the small g-protein  xxxg1921xxx , whereas thioderivates
with a pyrimidine-like nucleus inhibit the i␬b-kinase activity.

described a complete clinical and pathologic resolution upon
antithyroid treatment with  xxxd435xxx  (hardiman et al.,
1997). thionamide therapy is also beneficial to some chronic
inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis (elias, 2004). in
addition, it protects from autoimmune diseases in experimental animal models (singer et al., 1994; mozes et al., 1998)
or diminishes aberrant leukocyte adhesion as observed in
pathological inflammation (dagia et al., 2004). these observations may now be explained by the thionamide-mediated
inhibition of nf-␬b.
we observed that the mechanism of thionamide-mediated
immunosuppression depended on the chemical structure of
the individual reagent. thioureylenes with a pyrimidine-like
nucleus such as the antithyroid drug  xxxd3036xxx  (presented data) or the barbiturates thiopental or  xxxd3348xxx 
(loop et al., 2002, 2003) showed high resemblance in dose
response, and both inhibited the i␬b␣-kinase complex. in
contrast,  xxxd435xxx , a sulfur-containing imidazole derivate, repressed the proximal activation of  xxxg1921xxx , necessary
for mlk3- or mekk1-dependent activation of ikk␣␤.
redox-active sulfur was central for the nf-␬b-inhibitory
potential of  xxxd435xxx ,  xxxd3036xxx , and thiobarbiturates as demonstrated by comparison with  xxxd2594xxx  or
the oxy-analogs of barbiturates. thiobarbiturates inhibited
nf-␬b, but their oxy-analogs showed only marginal effects
on their activation (loop et al., 2002, 2003). likewise,  xxxd435xxx  and  xxxd2594xxx  demonstrated diametric properties depending on the biochemical activity of the associated
sulfur group.  xxxd2594xxx , due to its stable aromatic structure, shows no anti-inflammatory activity, whereas  xxxd435xxx , although it contains an analog imidazole nucleus, is not
an aromatic compound but includes redox-active sulfur. carbohydrate side chains (ethylcarbamate) and components of
the heterocycle (thiourea,  xxxd2537xxx , imidazole) had no
immunoregulatory effects because these reagents did not
significantly inhibit nf-␬b-dependent reporter gene expression (m. humar, unpublished observations).
several publications confirm that molecular targets of thioureylenes are susceptible to sulfur. the structural analysis of
ikk subunits suggests that cysteine residues are present in
the activation loop within the kinase domain at sites critical
for enzymatic activity (byun et al., 2006). these sites might
serve as molecular targets for heterocyclic thioderivates. in
addition, it has been described that thiol-reactive agents
block ikk activity and prevent the subsequent activation of
nf-␬b (jeon et al., 2000; loop et al., 2003). for  xxxg1921xxx  activation, a redox-reactive cysteine within the p-loop motif, is
crucially involved in the guanine nucleotide exchange (heo
and campbell, 2005). the x-ray crystal structure indicates
that this cys18 thiol is solvent-accessible (heo and campbell, 2005) and thus might represent a direct target for  xxxd435xxx . most probably, active posttranslational modifications do not participate in  xxxd435xxx -mediated  xxxg1921xxx 
inhibition because the interaction of  xxxg1921xxx  and pak was
repressed in cellular lysates despite gtp␥s stimulation.
nf-␬b is critically involved in the pathogenesis of diseases
independent from inflammation (kumar et al., 2004). in
these cases, heterocyclic thioderivates might also be useful
for molecular intervention and medical treatment. screening
methods and molecular modeling indicate that heterocyclic
agents containing thionamides and thiourea are potent inhibitors of protein function (buchholz et al., 2006). to eval-

nf-␬b serves as an ubiquitous regulator of the host immune and inflammatory response, and its participation in
apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation has recently been
demonstrated (karin, 1998, 2006; li and verma, 2002). however, excessive activation or deregulation of nf-␬b is
thought to play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of
several immunologic and inflammatory disorders such as
morbus alzheimer, atherosclerosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, and
multiple sclerosis (wright and christman, 2003; kumar et
al., 2004).

uate the application of heterocyclic thioureylenes in nf-␬brelated diseases, more case observations and clinical studies
are necessary. we suggest the analysis of hyperthyroid patients with secondary clinical symptoms associated with
nf-␬b deregulation and ongoing therapy with thionamides.
after treatment, differences in the clinical manifestation of
nf-␬b-associated symptoms might be related to our observations. in addition, the inhibitory potential of heterocyclic
thioureylenes might be optimized by chemical modifications.
in summary, our work demonstrates a molecular mechanism of immunosuppression by mononuclear heterocyclic
thioureylenes. due to the fact that thionamides inhibit proteins that are involved in numerous aspects of cellular responses and are ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, extensive side effects of treatment might be expected. at the
same time, new therapeutic applications may evolve using
thioureylenes for the development of new molecules in medical chemistry.
