yap1 confers resistance to the  xxxg765xxx  inhibitor  xxxd463xxx 
through the transporter flr1p in saccharomyces cerevisiae

received: 21 august 1998 / accepted: 1 december 1998

abstract in this study, we utilized a genetic approach to
identify genes which render yeast cells resistant to
 xxxd463xxx  (cer), a potent and noncompetitive inhibitor
of  xxxg765xxx  (fas). overexpression of the yeast
transcription factor yap1p was found to confer cer resistance (cerr). this resistance was shown to be less
pronounced in a strain deleted for ycf1, a multidrug
resistance  xxxg22xxx , supporting previous observations that implicated ycf1 in mediating cerr. however, isolation of yap1 as a high-copy cerr gene in a
ycf1d strain suggested that yap1-induced cerr was
mediated by additional downstream eectors. overexpression of neither  xxxg981xxx  nor a predicted
aryl  xxxg110xxx  (the products of two yap1regulated genes involved in detoxi®cation) conferred
cerr. overexpression of atr1, another yap1-regulated gene previously implicated in conferring resistance to
a number of cytotoxic drugs, was also incapable of
making cells resistant to cer. in contrast, overexpression
of flr1p, a yeast transporter of the major facilitator
superfamily which is also under the control of yap1,
was sucient to confer cerr in an otherwise wild-type
background. moreover, cerr was markedly diminished
in a strain deleted for flr1. these ®ndings implicate
members of both of the transporter superfamilies involved in multiple drug resistance (mdr) in the acquisition of cerr in yeast. furthermore, our studies indicate
that yeast may be a useful model system in which to
investigate the role of fas in cancer biology and the
eects of cer on eukaryotic cell growth.

introduction
overexpression of  xxxg765xxx  has been identi®ed
as a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer (kuhajda
et al. 1994). an increase in the levels of endogenous fatty
acid synthesis has been demonstrated to accompany
overexpression of fas in a number of established human breast carcinoma cell lines, suggesting that fas
activity parallels fas expression in these cell lines. the
®nding of fas overexpression is not limited to breast
cancer and has been observed in malignant cells of
ovarian, endometrial, colorectal and prostatic origin,
indicating that the phenomenon is widespread in human
epithelial malignancies (pizer et al. 1996a,b,c). therefore, speci®c inhibitors of fas may provide a new and
selective approach to antineoplastic therapy. in support
of this hypothesis,  xxxd463xxx , a potent and noncompetitive inhibitor of fas, has been found to induce programmed cell death in fas-overexpressing human
breast cancer cell lines, indicating that fas activity may
be essential for the aggressive growth characteristics of
these cell lines (pizer et al. 1996a). a recent study using a
xenograft model of ovarian cancer in nude mice has
shown that treatment with cer and consequent inhibition of fas activity results in regression of established
ascites tumors, a reduction in the incidence of ascites
and a signi®cant increase in survival (pizer et al. 1996b).
the human  xxxg1785xxx  cell line hl60 also
expresses elevated levels of fas, demonstrates increased
fatty acid synthesis and is markedly growth-inhibited by
cer, indicating that the chemotherapeutic potential of
cer may not be limited to the treatment of epithelial
carcinomas (pizer et al. 1996c).
fas activity is also vital to the normal growth of
microorganisms including yeast, fungi and bacteria, as
demonstrated by the potent antibiotic eects of cer
(omura 1976; saermark et al. 1991; duronio et al. 1992;
johnson et al. 1994a,b; saitoh et al. 1996; sanglard et al.
1996). such microorganisms may provide useful model
systems in which to investigate the uptake, metabolism

347

and toxicity of, and resistance to, this potential chemotherapeutic agent. to this end, we have utilized a genetic
approach in yeast to identify genes which confer resistance to  xxxd463xxx  (cerr). overexpression of the jun-like
transcription factor yap1p, which functions as a multidrug resistance and stress-response regulator in yeast
(moye-rowley et al. 1988, 1989; gounalaki and thireos
1994), was found to confer cerr. furthermore, this resistance was independent of ycf1, a gene encoding a
multidrug resistance  xxxg22xxx , which was previously shown to be under the control of yap1 (wemmie et al. 1994b). we also investigated other potential
downstream mediators of yap1-induced  xxxd463xxx  resistance. these studies have identi®ed flr1p as a second
yeast drug transporter involved in mediating resistance
to  xxxd463xxx . our ®ndings implicate both major mdr
transporter families in the acquisition of  xxxd463xxx  resistance in yeast, and indicate that yeast may be a useful
model system in which to pursue the role of fas in
cancer biology and the eects of cer on eukaryotic cell
growth.

materials and methods
yeast strains and growth conditions
the saccharomyces cerevisiae strain jk93d (heitman et al. 1991;
ura3-52 leu2-3, -112 his4 trp1 rme1) was used for the initial library
screening and subsequent subcloning, unless otherwise indicated.
the parent strain sey6210 (mata leu2-3,-112 ura3-52 his3-d200
trp1- xxxd901xxx  lys2-801 suc2-d9 mel)) and the ycf deletion strain
jwy53 (mata ycf1d leu2-3,-112 ura3-52 his3-d200 trp1- xxxd901xxx 
lys2-801 suc2-d9 mel) were provided by dr. w. scott moyerowley (wemmie et al. 1994a). the strains mry13-1a ( xxxg1661xxx  his3
leu2 trp1 ura3 can1 flr1) and mry13-1b ( xxxg1661xxx  his3 leu2 trp1 ura3
can1 ¯r1d::his3), transformed with yep352 (a ura3-based,
multicopy vector) alone or with pyep352-yap1, were provided by
dr. martine raymond (alarco et al. 1997).  xxxd463xxx  (sigma) from
a 5 mg/ml stock solution in dmso was diluted to a ®nal concentration of 20 lg/ml in yepd medium (10 g yeast extract, 20 g
peptone, 20 g bacto-agar, 20 g dextrose per l) for the preparation
of selective plates. where indicated, galactose was substituted for
glucose as a carbon source in cer-containing plates, to allow induction of genes under control of the gal promoter.
plasmids
a yeast genomic library constructed in prs202 was kindly provided to us by p. hieter (unpublished). the vector is a modi®ed
version of the prs306 vector, and carries a 2 l origin of replication. a partial sau3ai digest of yeast genomic dna was size
fractionated and inserted into bamhi/bglii-digested prs202, giving rise to inserts of approximately 6±8 kb in length (sikorski and
hieter 1989). wild-type yeast cells were transformed with this library and selected for uracil prototrophy, and transformants were
then pooled and replated onto cer containing plates. the pyes2
yeast expression vector (invitrogen) was used for regulatable expression of yap1. this vector contains the ura3 gene (which
allows transformants to grow in media without uracil), and an
ampicillin resistance marker and origin of replication that function
in e. coli. genes expressed using this system are placed under the
control of the gal promoter, which allows expression in the
presence of galactose and not in the presence of glucose. the
yep352 vector is a ura3-based, multicopy vector (alarco et al.

1997). yeast transformations were performed using the lithium
acetate method, as previously described (ito et al. 1983).
molecular biological methods
restriction enzymes and vent polymerase were from new england
biolabs, and were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. dna sequence analysis was performed by the method
of sanger et al. (1977) using a sequenase kit from united states
biochemicals. isolation of plasmids from yeast was performed as
follows: 2 ml of overnight culture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for
5 min, and the cells resuspended in 100 ll of stet buer (2%
sucrose, 5% triton x-100, 50 mm tris-hcl, 50 mm edta ph
8), to which 0.2 g of glass beads was added. cells were vortexed for
5 min at 4° c, followed by the addition of 100 ll of stet buer
and boiling for 3 min. after brie¯y cooling on ice and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4° c, 100 ll of the supernatant was
added to 50 ll of 7.5 m ammonium acetate, and genomic dna
was allowed to precipitate at )20° c for 2 h. after a 10-min centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, 100 ll of the supernatant was added to
200 ll of ice-cold ethanol and the precipitated plasmid dna was
washed with 70% ethanol, dried and resuspended in 20 ll of sterile
water for use in e. coli transformations. transformation of e. coli
was performed by electroporation of competent cells using a biorad e. coli pulser according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
cloning of yeast genes
all of the genes studied here (unless otherwise indicated) were
cloned downstream of the gal promoter in pyes2 (invitrogen).
the cloning strategy involved pcr ampli®cation of the gene of
interest using high-®delity vent dna polymerase (new england
biolabs), simultaneously introducing appropriate restriction enzyme sites in the ¯anking regions. all oligonucleotides were synthesized by operon technologies.

characterization of a  xxxd463xxx  resistance gene
to determine the toxicity of  xxxd463xxx  to s. cerevisiae
cells growing on agar plates, 108 exponentially growing
wild-type yeast cells were inoculated onto yepd agar
plates infused with either 0.2 lg/ml, 2.0 lg/ml or
20 lg/ml cer. whereas cer at 0.2 and 2.0 lg/ml did not
signi®cantly aect viability, 20 lg/ml cer completely
abolished growth, and no colonies were observed for as
long as 2 weeks (data not shown). this eect was not
strain speci®c, in that strains with three dierent genetic
backgrounds were equally sensitive to 20 lg/ml cer.
to identify genes which confer cerr, the wild-type
strain jk93d was transformed with the yeast genomic
library in prs202. this library is carried on a yeast
expression vector which is maintained at high copy
number and, thus, should allow identi®cation of genes
which provide cerr when overexpressed. transformants
were selected for uracil prototrophy, pooled and replated onto plates containing 20 lg/ml cer. screening of
approximately 5 ´ 106 transformants yielded about 250
colonies which were resistant to cer. serial restreaking
of these colonies onto cer plates identi®ed 12 highly
resistant clones, and these were evaluated further.

348

restriction enzyme analysis indicated that all 12
clones contained the same genomic dna insert. partial
sequencing of this fragment localized it to yeast chromosome xiii and indicated the presence of three orfs
encoding (1) delta(24)-sterol c-methyl transferase
(which was only partially contained on the cloned
fragment, (2) the yap1 gene, and (3) an unknown orf
with the capacity to encode a 774-amino acid protein.
each of these three genes was separately subcloned in
pyes2. the methyltransferase gene was cloned using
conveniently located restriction sites, whereas the yap1
gene and the unknown orf were cloned using pcr.
the sequences of the primers used for cloning these, as
well as other genes in this study, are presented in table 1. the cloning strategy allowed each gene to be expressed under the control of the yeast gal promoter,
which permits transcription in the presence of galactose
and not in the presence of glucose. these constructs were
transformed into wild-type yeast, transformants were
selected for uracil prototrophy and then inoculated onto
yep/cer plates containing either glucose or galactose as
a carbon source. the orf encoding the yap1 transcription factor was found to confer cerr when expression was induced by galactose (fig. 1). cerr was not
observed when yap1 transcription was repressed in the
presence of glucose, and the two other candidate orfs
did not confer cerr in the presence of either glucose or
galactose (fig. 1), con®rming that yap1 is speci®cally
able to confer cerr.
yap1, also known as pdr4, encodes a well characterized transcriptional regulator of the oxidative stress
response in yeast. this gene has been shown to mediate
resistance to a number of pharmacologically distinct
toxic substances including diazaborine, arsenic, malondialdehyde, cycloheximide, 4-nitroquinolone n-oxide
(4-nqo), cadmium, nitrosoguanidine, o-phenanthroline
and  xxxd2298xxx  (moye-rowley et al. 1989;
hussain and lenard 1991; schnell and entian 1991;
bossier et al. 1993; gounalaki and thireos 1994; grey
and brendel 1994; kuge and jones 1994; wemmie et al.
1994a; stephen et al. 1995; wendler et al. 1997).

fig. 1 yap1 overexpression confers resistance to  xxxd463xxx . the s.
cerevisiae strain jk93d was transformed with plasmid constructs
harboring the yap1 gene (sectors 1, 2 and 3), a methyl transferase
gene (sectors 4 and 5) or an unknown gene (sectors 6 and 7) all under
the control of the gal promoter in pyes2. isolated colonies were
then streaked on yep plates containing 20 lg/ml cer with either 2%
glucose (glu) or galactose (gal) as the carbon source, placed at 30° c
and photographed 96 h later

ycf1 does not account for yap1-mediated cerr
the multidrug resistance phenotype conferred by overexpression of yap1p has been shown to be mediated, at
least in part, through its regulation of ycf1, which
encodes an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter that
confers multidrug resistance by either eliminating or
sequestering the toxic compounds in yeast (wemmie
et al. 1994a; miyahara et al. 1996; li et al. 1997). to
determine whether yap1-induced  xxxd463xxx  resistance is
mediated through the action of ycf1p, the yap1-pyes2
construct was transformed into a strain in which the
ycf1 structural gene had been deleted. as shown in
fig. 2a, although cerr conferred by yap1 was decreased in the ycf1d strain, both the wild-type and ycf1d
strains transformed with yap1-pyes2 were able to
grow on cer-containing plates. to obtain more quantitative data we monitored the growth of these strains in
liquid cultures supplemented with increasing concen-

trations of cer. yep medium containing 1% galactose
was inoculated with ycf1d and the wild-type parental
strain, harboring either yap1-pyes2 or the control
plasmid. growth was then monitored over a 6-day period by recording the absorbance at 600 nm. the results
presented in fig. 2b indicate that both wild-type and
ycf1d strains could grow in the presence of up to 30 lg/

ml of cer if provided with a plasmid allowing for the
overexpression of yap1. however the ycf1 wild-type
strain seemed to have a slight advantage over the ycf1
mutant strain in that it grew to higher densities when
challenged with increasing concentrations of cer. this
dierence was more pronounced in later stages of
growth ± at 144 h post inoculation, around the time the

350

photograph in fig. 2a was taken. taken together, our
results establish that yap1 is able to confer cerr
through a ycf1-independent mechanism.
to con®rm that ycf1 is not required for cerr, we
attempted to isolate cer-resistant yeast colonies in a ycfbackground. we transformed the ycf1d strain with the
prs202 genomic library, and pooled and replated the
transformants onto cer plates. numerous cer-resistant
clones were recovered and analyzed by physical mapping
and dna sequencing. all were found to contain yap1,
con®rming that yap1 confers cerr independently of
ycf1.
yap1-mediated cerr requires flr1
an alternative potential mediator of cerr is the atr1
protein. this protein confers resistance to aminotriazole
and 4-nitroquinoline, and its gene has been shown to be
upregulated in response to elevated levels of the yap1
protein. pcr ampli®cation of this gene, using the speci®c primers listed in table 1, was used to place atr1
under control of the gal promoter in pyes2 plasmid.
however induction of the atr1 gene by growth in galactose containing medium could not protect cells from
cer toxicity (data not shown).
to test other potential downstream eectors of
yap1-mediated cerr, we overexpressed the genes encoding  xxxg981xxx  and a putative aryl alcohol
dehydrogenase in the jk93d strain (see table 1 for pcr
primer sequences). these two candidate genes, which
have previously been shown to be regulated at the
transcriptional level by yap1p, are both involved in
general detoxi®cation reactions which could potentially
inactivate cer. despite this potential, neither of these
genes were capable of conferring resistance to  xxxd463xxx 
when overexpressed from the pyes2 shuttle vector
(data not shown).
in contrast, yap1-induced  xxxd463xxx  resistance was
found to be markedly diminished in a strain deleted for
the flr1 gene. the flr1 gene, named for fluconazole
resistance, was recently identi®ed as a yeast gene which
is dramatically induced in the presence of cap1 (a
functional homologue of yap1 in candida albicans) and
encodes a yeast transporter of the major facilitator
family. as shown in fig. 3, cells deleted for this gene are
incapable of growth on  xxxd463xxx -containing plates, even
when they carry the yap1 gene on a high-copy-number
plasmid, thus implicating flr1 as the major eector in
acquisition of  xxxd463xxx  resistance. to con®rm the role
of flr1 in mediating  xxxd463xxx  resistance, we monitored
the eect of overexpression of flr1 on the ability of
otherwise wild-type yeast cells to grow in the presence of
cer. jk93d cells were transformed with the 2 l plasmid
p425-gpd (mumberg et al. 1995) carrying the flr1
gene under the control of the gpd promoter. transformants were streaked on ypd plates containing
20 lg/ml cer. as shown in fig. 4a, the flr1-overexpressing clones were capable of growing on this con-

centration of cer, whereas jk93d cells transformed with
the vector alone failed to grow. monitoring of the
growth of these cells in liquid medium supplemented
with increasing concentrations of cer (fig. 4b) established that flr1 overexpression confers resistance to
cer concentrations of up to 30 lg/ml. in contrast, wildtype cells were inhibited by cer concentrations as low as
5 lg/ml. taken together these results implicate the
flr1 gene as the major eector of cerr, and the major
target of yap1p in the context of its role in mediating
cerr in s. cerevisiae.
finally, to delineate in more detail the roles of yap1,
ycf1 and flr1 in mediating cerr, mic50 values were
determined for all the strains. the results presented in
table 2 indicate that in the ycf1d strain, overexpression
of yap1 is capable of conferring cerr to a level equal to
only about 30% of the wild type resistance level. this is
in agreement with our plate assays in which ycf1d cells
grew to lower densities than the wild-type cells in the
presence of cer. it is also evident that overexpression of
flr1 confers resistance to approximately two-fold
higher levels of cer than does overexpression of yap1.

discussion
the overexpression of fas and corresponding increases
in fas activity found in a number of human epithelial
malignancies and leukemia cells suggests a role for fas
in the etiology and/or progression of cancer. cer is being
considered as a possible chemotherapeutic agent, because it is a potent and irreversible inhibitor of fas and

fig. 3 yap1 mediated cerr is lost in a strain deleted for the flr1
gene. the strains mry13-1a (flr1+) and mry13-1b ¯r1d were
transformed with either the vector, pyep352, or with pyep352yap1, and restreaked on yepd plates containing cer. note that
with this vector galactose is not necessary for induction of yap1
expression. sector 1, wild-type flr1 strain transformed with the
vector alone; sector 2, ¯r1 deletion mutant transformed with the
vector alone; sector 3, the deletion strain transformed with the yap1

construct

the indicated strains were grown in yp plus galactose medium in
the presence of increasing concentrations of  xxxd463xxx . yap1 and
flr1 overexpression was achieved by transforming the indicated
strains with multicopy plasmids harboring these genes, as described
in materials and methods. mic50 is de®ned as the  xxxd463xxx  concentration at which 50% of the cells survive

the likelihood of successful drug delivery, identify potential agonists of cer-induced apoptosis which might be
utilized in combination drug therapy, and provide information which might permit the synthesis of more
potent cer analogs in the future.
in these studies, we have investigated cerr using
yeast as a model system. whereas other groups have
mutagenized yeast and other fungi, repeatedly isolating
structural fas gene mutations which confer cerr (inokoshi et al. 1994; mcelhaney-feser and cihlar 1995),
we instead used a scheme to isolate genes which confer
cerr by virtue of their overexpression. in this manner,
yap1 has been identi®ed as a mediator of cerr. yap1 is
an  xxxg1222xxx -like transcription factor that has previously been
shown to confer resistance to a number of pharmacologically distinct toxins, as well as heavy metals and
osmotic stress, when overexpressed from a high-copynumber plasmid in yeast. the mechanisms of resistance
appear to involve a number of downstream eectors. a
recent study using the powerful technique of yeast genome microarray analysis has identi®ed 17 genes whose
expression is induced by yap1 overexpression, includ-

352

ing oxoreductases, aryl  xxxg110xxx , glutathione transferase, nadph dehydrogenase and one
gene which shows homology to a methotrexate resistance protein (derisi et al. 1997). in addition, ycf1, an
atp-binding cassette transporter that functions as an
mdr-like membrane pump, has been shown to be induced by yap1 overexpression and to be involved in
mediating resistance to certain drugs. it has been shown
that ycf1 might function by vacuolar sequestration of
organic compounds after their s-conjugation with glutathione (li et al. 1996, 1997). hirata and coworkers
(1994) had previously reported that the disruption of the
ycf1 gene leads to hypersensitivity to cer and suggested that this gene is responsible for cerr in yeast. in
our hands, a ycf1 deletion strain is still capable of
growth in the presence of cer, albeit at around 30% of
the wild-type rate. additionally, our success in isolating
cer-resistant colonies by screening our yeast plasmid
library in a ycf1d background pointed to the presence of
other eectors of cerr in yeast. on the other hand, when
the flr1 gene is insertionally inactivated, the cells
completely lose their ability to grow on cer-containing
media, even when yap1 is overexpressed. furthermore,
overexpression of flr1 by itself is capable of conferring
cerr on jk93d cells. taken together, these results indicate that the major eector of yap1-mediated resistance to cer is the flr1 gene.
flr1 is a representative of the major facilitator
family (mfs) of multidrug resistance proteins in yeast
(kanazawa et al. 1988; goèmpel-klein et al. 1989;
goèmpel-klein and brendel 1990). whereas the abctype transporters function as atp-dependent cellular
eux transporters, the major facilitator family is likely
to act by undergoing reversible conformational changes
within the membrane, which alternatively expose the
solute-binding site to one or the other side and thus
``facilitate'' transfer of drug across the membrane. interestingly, there have been reports of overlaps among
the substrates used by mfs and abc-type transporters.
therefore, it is entirely possible that ycf1 and flr1
are both involved in mediating cerr. our observation
that the ycf1d strain grows more slowly than the isogenic wild-type strain on cer-containing media is consistent with this notion.
the identi®cation of cer as a target of the major
facilitator family may provide further insight into the
determinants of substrate speci®city for this class of
multidrug resistance proteins. furthermore, drug resistance mediated by flr1 in yeast may provide a useful
way in which to determine whether cer analogs and
other potential chemotherapeutic agents are mdr drug
targets. in a similar vein, large-scale studies aimed at
using the s. cerevisiae model system and techniques of
genomic analysis for the identi®cation of therapeutic
drug targets are currently underway in a number of
laboratories (see, for example, giaever et al. 1998)
it is interesting that neither glutathione transferase
nor a putative aryl  xxxg110xxx , when overexpressed, was capable of protecting cells from cer

toxicity. cer contains an epoxide (a strained ring ether)
at carbon c2-3, which is believed to mediate its inhibition
of  xxxg765xxx . epoxides are a favorite target of
glutathione transferase, which would catalyze the
opening of the ring to produce an alcohol at carbon c2-3,
while the other carbon would condense with glutathione
through a thioether bond. aryl alcohol dehydrogenases
might function in a similar manner by acting as epoxide
hydrolases, yielding a diol product. it is possible that
overexpression of these genes does not provide sucient
amounts of active enzyme to overcome cer toxicity, or
that multiple mechanisms must act in concert to yield
cerr, or both. further studies aimed at clarifying
whether these detoxifying enzymes play any role in
mediating cerr and identifying additional genetic components involved in mediating cerr are currently underway and should provide valuable information on the
routes of transport and detoxi®cation of this potential
chemotherapeutic agent in eukaryotic cells.
acknowledgements we are indebted to dr. stuart smith for his
advice and support throughout this study. we are also grateful to
drs. william fishbein for his suggestions regarding the potential
mechanisms of cer detoxi®cation, and scott moye-rowley and
martine raymond for their generous gifts of ycf and ¯r mutants
and the flr1 overexpression plasmid. this work was supported by
a chori endowment grant, g12.7810, to bo and an nih grant,
1ro1 ca77528±01, to jds. the experiments described in this
paper comply with the current laws of usa.
