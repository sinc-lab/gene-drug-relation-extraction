human metabolism of  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate, a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist.   xxxd1924xxx  mesylate is a selective and potent  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist. this drug is currently in development for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy. the metabolism of  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate was studied in six healthy male volunteers who were given a single 300 mg oral dose of [14c] xxxd1924xxx  mesylate. an average of 59% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 25% in the feces. metabolites were quantitated in urine samples taken up to 36 hr postdose. reduced  xxxd1924xxx  (rd) accounted for 17-54% of the dose in urine. hydroxylated metabolites of rd made up no more than 9% of the dose in urine. most of the remaining urinary radioactivity consisted of conjugated metabolites of rd and hydroxy rd. hydrolysis of selected urine samples showed that the glucuronide of rd was the most abundant conjugate in urine. a small percentage of the dose (< 1%) in urine was identified as the n-oxide of rd. analysis of urine samples by chiral hplc indicated that the r(+):s(-) ratio of rd was approximately 9:1.
