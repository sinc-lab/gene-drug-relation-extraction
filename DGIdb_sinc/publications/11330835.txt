abstract
non-enzymatic glycation is a common post-translational modification of tissue and plasma proteins which can impair their
functions in living organisms. in this study, the authors have demonstrated for the first time an inhibitory effect of in vitro
glycation on the catalytic activity of  xxxg941xxx  (alt, ec 2.6.1.2), a  xxxd3047xxx  enzyme with several
lysine residues in the molecule. the porcine heart enzyme was incubated with 50 mmol/l d-fructose, d-glucose, d,l-glyceraldehyde, or d-ribose in 0.1 mol/l phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) at 25°c for up to 20 days. the strongest glycation effect was
shown by d,l-glyceraldehyde, which caused complete enzyme inhibition within 6 days. after 20 days of incubation, the alt
activity in samples with d-fructose and d-ribose was less than 7% of the initial enzyme activity. a statistically significant effect of d-glucose on the enzymatic activity of alt was not found. incubation of alt with d-fructose, d,l-glyceraldehyde
and d-ribose minimized its catalytic activity both in the glycated and non-glycated fractions of the samples. markedly higher
activity was found in the glycated fraction with glucose. the inhibitory effect of glycation of alt with d-fructose and d-ribose was found to be more intensive in the presence of l-alanine and weaker in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate. the findings
suggest that glycation of the epsilon-amino group of lys313 as a crucial part of the catalytic site of alt may contribute to alt inactivation in the presence of glycating sugars. nevertheless, glycation of lysine residues outside the active center of alt seems
to be primary. (mol cell biochem 218: 35–39, 2001)

introduction
non-enzymatic glycation is a common modification of tissue and plasma proteins which can impair their functions in
living organisms. the glycation reaction occurs above all in
non-compensated diabetic patients during their hyperglycemic
states as one of the most important causes of late diabetic
complications. the extent of the reaction is dependent upon
the number of reactive epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues in
the protein, the type and concentration of sugars, and the
biological half-time of the protein [1]. glycation and formation of advanced glycation end-products (age) affect mainly
the functions of long living proteins. nevertheless, the results
of many in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that sugar
binding can also inhibit catalytic activities of enzymes [1–7].

 xxxg941xxx  (alt; ec 2.6.1.2) plays a fundamental biochemical role in the metabolism of amino acids. the highest tissue activities of this enzyme are found in
the cytoplasm of the liver, kidney and heart. the cytosolic
isoenzyme of alt shows lower affinity (higher km) for lalanine and it is probably involved in the conversion of
pyruvate to l-alanine. this is supported by the fact that this
isoenzyme is predominant in glycolytic tissues. the mitochondrial isoenzyme with its relatively higher affinity for lalanine is mainly involved in the formation of pyruvate from
l-alanine [8–10]. a lower alt activity is present in serum
[11]. an abnormal serum activity of alt is very important
in the diagnosis of liver diseases.
the coenzyme of alt is pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, which
is bound to lys313 in the active site. about 15–20 other lysine

residues (according to animal species) are present in the molecule outside the active center [12, 13]. that is why glycation
of the enzyme molecule by glucose in higher concentrations
or by several other, more reactive monosaccharides, is possible. in view of the above-mentioned role of alt, its glycation,
if connected with a decrease in catalytic activity, might influence metabolic flows of carbon and nitrogen in the organism.
in the present study, a possible inhibitory effect of in vitro
glycation on the enzymatic activity of alt is demonstrated
for the first time.

materials and methods
chemicals
 xxxg941xxx  (180 units per mg protein), cytosolic enzyme from porcine heart suspended in 1.8 mol/l
ammonium sulfate, ph 6.0 was purchased from sigma, st.
louis, mo, usa. d-fructose, d-glucose, d,l-glyceraldehyde
and d-ribose were obtained from lachema, brno, czech republic. l-alanine was bought from  xxxd2177xxx , budapest, hungary, and 2-oxoglutarate from fluka, buchs, switzerland.
sodium azide was obtained from merck, darmstadt, germany. all chemicals used were of analytical grade.

preparation and incubation of samples
a commercial alt suspension, corresponding to 20 mg/ml,
was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min. the supernatant was
removed and the enzyme pellet dissolved in 7.5 ml of 0.1 mol/l
sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). in the first part of the study
incubation samples contained 0.8 ml of dissolved enzyme,
0.1% sodium azide, and 50 mmol/l d-fructose, d-glucose,
d,l-glyceraldehyde or d-ribose in 0.1 mol/l phosphate buffer
(ph 7.4). the final enzyme concentration in the samples was
0.2 mg/ml. in the second part, mixtures were composed of
0.8 ml of alt, 50 mmol/l d-fructose or d-ribose, 0.1% sodium
azide, and 25 mmol/l l-alanine or 0.5 mmol/l 2-oxoglutarate
in the same buffer. the total volume of samples was 3.2 ml.
all samples were incubated at 25°c for up to 20 days. alt
in phosphate buffer without sugar and substrates was used
as the control.

determination of alt activity
sample aliquots (100 µl) were removed at time zero and at
2, 6, 9, 13 and 20 days of incubation. after collection the
aliquots were diluted 35-fold with 0.1 mol/l phosphate buffer,
ph 7.4, and alt activity was assayed in triplicates on a hitachi

917 analyzer (roche diagnostics, mannheim, germany) using the common kinetic uv-method with addition of pyridoxal-5′-phosphate to the incubation mixture. alt activities
in precinorm u and precipath u (both from roche diagnostics) were measured before and after each assay. the betweenrun coefficient of variation of the assay for precinorm u was
1.8%; for precipath u it was 1.5%.

separation of glycated and non-glycated fractions of alt
after 20 days of incubation, 300 µl of samples was applied
to the glycogel ii m-aminophenylboronic affinity columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions (pierce
chemical co., rockford, il, usa). columns were washed
with 20 ml of the equilibration-wash buffer (250 mmol/l ammonium acetate containing 50 mmol/l  xxxd2532xxx 
and 0.02% sodium azide, ph 8.0; pierce). the pass through
and wash fractions were marked as ng (non-glycated) protein fractions. the g (glycated) protein fractions were then
eluted with 3 ml of the elution buffer (100 mmol/l sodium
citrate and 0.05% sodium azide, ph 4.5; pierce). alt activities were determined in both fractions in doublets as above,
but without further dilution.

statistical analysis
values of enzymatic activity, taking into account diluting
factors for different experiments, are given as means ± s.d.
for comparisons of data, student’s t-test was used. a p value
of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
the decrease in the catalytic activity of alt from porcine
heart after 20 days of incubation with various sugars varied.
the dependence of enzyme inactivation on the presence of
these sugars and time of incubation is illustrated in fig. 1.
relative values (in µkat/l) are presented in the figure in order to avoid minor fluctuations caused by daily analytical
recalibrations of the analyzer. the absolute values in the control samples were as follows: 342.72 ± 12.6 (day 0), 365.76 ±
5.76 (day 2), 400.32 ± 11.88 (day 6), 399.60 ± 25.56 (day 9),
371.88 ± 9.00 (day 13), and 414.12 ± 8.76 µkat/l (day 20).
the strongest glycation effect was shown by d,l-glyceraldehyde. complete enzyme inhibition was reached after 6
days but most enzymatic activity (about 75%) was reduced
in the course of the first 2 days of incubation. moreover, a
decrease in alt activity to 88% of the relevant control was
apparent at the zero-time determination of the enzymatic
activity in the glyceraldehyde sample.

50 mmol/l sugars in 0.1 mol/l phosphate buffer, ph 7.4 at 25°c. aliquots
of samples were taken at days 0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 20 and remaining enzyme activities in samples were determined. activity was expressed as a percentage of the activity of the control sample (without sugars). l alt with
d-glucose; ◊ alt with d-ribose; ♦ alt with d-fructose; n alt with d,lglyceraldehyde.

significant changes in alt activity were also apparent in
the samples with d-fructose and d-ribose. figure 1 demonstrates a significant decrease in catalytic activity after 2 days
of incubation with d-fructose and after 6 days with d-ribose.
the rate of inactivation was almost linear over the first 6 days,
especially in the case of fructose. a loss of 50% of enzymatic
activity was reached approximately after 4–6 days of incubation with 50 mmol/l concentrations of these two sugars at
25°c. after incubation, the alt activity in the samples with
d-fructose and d-ribose was less than 7% of the initial enzyme
activity. the final residual activities of alt after 20 days of
incubation in the samples and control are given in table 1
(first column).
however, we did not find a statistically significant effect
of d-glucose on enzymatic activity of alt. after 20 days the
activity in the sample remained essentially unchanged in
comparison with the control.
table 1 presents a significant decrease in alt activity in
ng fractions separated from the samples with d-fructose

(p < 0.01), d-ribose (p < 0.02) or d,l-glyceraldehyde (p < 0.01)
in comparison with the control, while the decrease with dglucose was only low. the second and third columns of table 1 demonstrate the catalytic activity of alt in ng and g
fractions of all samples, respectively.
glycated fractions of alt in the samples with d-ribose and
d,l-glyceraldehyde showed a significant inhibition of alt
activity. in contrast, the enzymatic activity in the g fraction
of the d-glucose sample was significantly higher in comparison with the control (p < 0.05).
the third part of the study dealt with the effects of the
enzyme substrates l-alanine and 2-oxoglutarate on inhibition
of alt caused by the glycation reaction. figures 2 and 3 show
that inhibition of alt can be partly prevented by addition of
0.5 mmol/l 2-oxoglutarate. on the other hand, the presence
of 25 mmol/l l-alanine significantly increased a possibility
of glycation and enzyme inactivation. the changes in the
enzymatic activity of alt incubated in the presence of dfructose or d-ribose either with or without the enzyme substrates were apparent after 6 days of incubation.

discussion
okada et al. previously described an inhibitory effect of the
glycation reaction on the enzymatic activity of aspartate
aminotransferase [6, 14]. we found a similar effect in our
preliminary study 2 years earlier [15]. in the present study
we examined for the first time a possible influence of in vitro
incubation of alt with four different sugars (d-fructose, dglucose, d,l-glyceraldehyde, or d-ribose) on its catalytic
activity. we carried out 20-days incubation at 25°c for clearer
expression of the course of enzyme inhibition.
the rate of inhibition by the sugars increased in the order
d-glucose < d-fructose < d-ribose < d,l-glyceraldehyde.
this finding is in agreement with published results of other
studies concerning glycation reactions of sugars [6, 14, 16,
17].
d,l-glyceraldehyde, one of the intermediates of glucose
metabolism, was found to be the most potent alt inhibitor.

fifty mmol/l glyceraldehyde completely inhibited alt activity in 6 days. alt decreased to 7% of its initial enzymatic
activity after 20 days of incubation with 50 mmol/l d-fructose and d-ribose. in spite of slower inhibition at first six
days, ribose seems to be a slightly more effective inhibitor
of alt than fructose. this effect was also observed during
glycation experiments with aspartate aminotransferase [6].
d-glucose was ineffective on alt inhibition under the conditions examined. we speculate that the glucose reaction either does not influence alt activity or this reaction is too

slow in comparison with reactions of other sugars used in the
study.
in the second part we tried to establish the alt activities
of glycated and non-glycated enzyme fractions after their
separation by phenylboronate affinity columns. it could complete the information about the inhibition effect of glycation
on alt activity. our results (table 1), indicating minimization of alt activity in both g and ng fractions in the cases
of the d-fructose, d,l-glyceraldehyde and d-ribose samples,
suggest that glycation of alt by these monosaccharides is
connected with the loss of catalytic activity of the enzyme
molecule. in the case of d-glucose, lower alt activity in the
ng fraction and significantly higher activity in the g fraction than that in the control suggests that glucose prefers to
interact with lysine residues outside the active site, while this
site seems to be relatively resistant to the glycation reaction
with glucose. it corresponds to our observation of no remarkable inhibitory effect of glucose on enzymatic activity of alt.
some minor alt activity in the g fraction of the control
(about 0.8% of total) is probably caused by glycation of the
pig heart alt in vivo before the enzyme purification.
the alt molecule may contain about 15–20 lysine residues according to animal species, only one of them (lys313)
participating in the active site and binding pyridoxal-5′-phosphate [12, 13]. in general, there are the following possibilities how to explain the inhibitory effect of the glycation of
alt: (i) by binding a sugar directly to the epsilon-amino group of
the lys313 residue at the active site followed by direct inactivation of this site, (ii) by binding a sugar to lysine residues
outside the active site followed by a change of alt conformation leading to enzyme inhibition, (iii) by a combination
of both above-mentioned mechanisms.
in order to examine a possibility of glycation of the active
site glycation, alt was incubated with 50 mmol/l d-fructose or d-ribose in the presence of the enzyme substrates
l-alanine or 2-oxoglutarate. it is generally accepted that lalanine changes the pyridoxal form of alt to the pyridoxamine form: in the course of transaminase reaction, addition
of l-alanine to alt sets free lys313 from its aldimine binding to the coenzyme, which is released as  xxxd3048xxx . we hypothesized that the possibility of glycation of
lys313 should be increased in this situation. the results
showed that l-alanine significantly supported enzyme inhibition in the case of both sugars. on the other hand, 2oxoglutarate stabilizes lys313-plp aldimine and it should
diminish a possibility of glycation. this was confirmed by
the results, since 2-oxoglutarate partly prevented enzyme
inhibition during incubation of alt with d-fructose or dribose.
our findings suggest that beside glycation of lysine residues outside the active site, lys313 in the active site of alt
is involved in the glycation process of the alt molecule. its
contribution to the inactivation of alt during glycation is

39
influenced by conditions, especially by the form of enzyme.
cytosolic alt belongs to the slowly degraded enzymes
with a biological half-life of at least 3 days [18]. this fact,
together with our finding that the enzyme could be glycated
in vitro by various sugars suggests that also intracellular
glycation of alt enzyme is probable.
complete amino acid sequence of cytosolic  xxxg941xxx  is known in the rat and human liver [12, 13].
the presence of lysine in the active site of transaminases is
obligatory, and beside this, some 15–20 lysine residues may
be present in the cytosolic alt in various animal species. we
have not found any citation on mitochondrial alt but the
presence of several lysine residues in the molecule is highly
probable. both isoenzymes play an important role in amino
acid and carbohydrate metabolism: the cytosolic isoenzyme
is predominant in glycolytic tissues and seems to be involved
in the conversion of pyruvate to l-alanine. the mitochondrial
isoenzyme with its relatively higher affinity for l-alanine is
mainly involved in the formation of pyruvate from l-alanine
[8-10]. glycation of the enzyme molecule thus should influence intermediate metabolism and its regulation.
