the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is a member of
the rhodopsin-like family of g protein-coupled receptors
(gpcrs) and contains at least two ligand-binding sites: the
orthosteric site and a topographically distinct allosteric site.
the former is located within a pocket formed by the cluster of
transmembrane helices (curtis et al., 1989; hulme et al.,
1990), and binding involves amino acid residues that are well
conserved among the five muscarinic subtypes (curtis et al.,
1989; hulme et al., 2003). the allosteric site seems to be
located at the entrance to the orthosteric pocket (tuček and
proška, 1995), and it is thought to involve residues from the
second and third extracellular loops (ellis et al., 1993; ellis
and seidenberg, 2000).
muscarinic receptors are known to form oligomers (wreg-

 xxxg448xxx , albeit at comparatively high concentrations.

that is common to many and perhaps all gpcrs (e.g., gomes
et al., 2001; milligan, 2001; angers et al., 2002; park et al.,
2004). oligomerization results in two or more orthosteric and
allosteric sites per multimer, and such an arrangement could
allow for several types of cooperative interaction. heterotropic cooperativity between allosteric and orthosteric sites
could be either intra- or intermolecular with respect to individual molecules of the receptor. homotropic cooperativity
requires oligomers and could occur between orthosteric sites
on the one hand or allosteric sites on the other.1
heterotropic cooperativity between allosteric modulators
such as  xxxd2174xxx  and orthosteric ligands such as n-methyl
scopolamine is evident in the effect of the former on the rate

the terms hetero- and homocooperativity are used here according to the
convention of wyman and gill (1990). heterotropic cooperativity is taken to
denote interactions between sites that bind different ligands, as in cooperativity between the allosteric and orthosteric sites on the same or different
molecules of receptor. homotropic cooperativity denotes interactions between
sites that bind the same ligand, as in cooperativity between the orthosteric
sites on contiguous receptors.

abstract
the m2 muscarinic receptor has two topographically distinct
sites: the orthosteric site and an allosteric site recognized by
compounds such as  xxxd2174xxx . it also can exhibit cooperative
effects in the binding of orthosteric ligands, presumably to the
orthosteric sites within an oligomer. such effects would be
difficult to interpret, however, if those ligands also bound to the
allosteric site. monomers of the hemagglutinin (ha)- and flagtagged human  xxxg448xxx  therefore have been purified from
coinfected sf9 cells and examined for any effect of the antagonist n-methyl scopolamine or the agonist oxotremorine-m on
the rate at which n-[3h]methyl scopolamine dissociates from
the orthosteric site (kobsd). the predominantly monomeric
status was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and by cross-

allosteric site of the m2 muscarinic receptor

materials and methods
ligands, antibodies, and other materials. n-[3h]methyl scopolamine was purchased from ge healthcare (80 ci/mmol; chalfont
st. giles, buckinghamshire, uk). unlabeled n-methyl scopolamine
hydrobromide, oxotremorine-m,  xxxd2174xxx  triethiodide, carbamoylcholine chloride, and aminobenztropine were purchased from sigmaaldrich (st. louis, mo). obidoxime chloride was from toronto research chemicals, inc. (toronto, on, canada).
digitonin used for solubilization and purification of the receptor
was purchased from wako bioproducts (richmond, va) at purity
near 100%. digitonin used for buffers to pre-equilibrate and elute
sephadex g-50 columns in binding assays was purchased from cal-

biochem (san diego, ca).  xxxd1685xxx  was from sigma-aldrich. sephadex g-50 fine was purchased from sigma-aldrich, and fast-flow
deae-sepharose was from ge healthcare. other chemicals were
obtained as follows:  xxxd2532xxx  and  xxxd3213xxx  ( xxxg257xxx ,
inc., poole, dorset, uk), dithiothreitol (bioshop canada, burlington,
on, canada), glycerol (caledon laboratories ltd., georgetown, on,
canada), methanol, sds, and  xxxd2988xxx  (emd chemicals,
inc., san diego, ca), bs3 (pierce biotechnology, inc., rockford, il),
hepes (roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in), and edta, glycine,
 xxxd2534xxx , phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, tris ( xxxd3449xxx 
base), and tween 20 (sigma-aldrich).
econo-pacs and econo-columns were purchased from bio-rad
laboratories (mississauga, on, canada), and receptor was concentrated using centricon and centriprep concentrators (amicon) purchased from millipore corporation (billerica, ma). total protein
concentration was estimated by means of bicinchoninic acid using
the bca protein assay kit and bovine  xxxg124xxx , taken as the
standard, purchased from pierce.
anti-ha antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (goat) was
purchased from roche diagnostics. agarose-conjugated anti-flag
antibody used for immunoprecipitation was from sigma-aldrich (m2,
mouse).
muscarinic receptor. human m2 muscarinic receptor bearing
the hemagglutinin (ha; ypydvpdya) or flag (dykdddda)
epitope at the amino terminus was expressed in sf9 cells and purified as described previously (wreggett and wells, 1995; park et al.,
2001; ma et al., 2007). sf9 cells were cultured at 27°c in ex-cell 400
insect media (jrh biosciences, lenexa, ks) containing 2% fetal
bovine serum, 1%  xxxd164xxx  ( xxxd164xxx ), and 0.01% gentamicin (all from invitrogen canada, burlington, on, canada). cells
growing at a density of 2 ⫻ 106 cells/ml were infected with one or
both baculoviruses and harvested 48 h later. the total multiplicity of
infection was five. the membranes were solubilized in digitonincholate (0.86% digitonin, 0.17%  xxxd1685xxx ), and the receptor was
purified via successive passage on deae-sepharose, 3-(2⬘-aminobenzhydryloxy)tropane-sepharose, and hydroxyapatite. the final concentrations of digitonin and  xxxd1685xxx  were 0.1 and 0.02%, respectively.
purified receptor was stored at ⫺75°c.
cross-linking. samples of the unprocessed extract or the purified receptor were supplemented with an aliquot of the cross-linking
reagent bs3 in deionized water (20 mm) to yield a final concentration
of 2 mm. the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature,
and the reaction was terminated by the addition of tris-hcl (1 m, ph
8.00) to a final concentration of 20 mm. after further incubation for
15 min at room temperature, the sample was placed on ice pending
examination by electrophoresis as described below. samples lacking
bs3 but treated in a parallel and otherwise identical manner were
used as controls.
immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, and western blotting. those procedures were carried out essentially as described
previously (park et al., 2001; park and wells, 2003). to test for
coimmunoprecipitation, aliquots of tagged receptor (500 ␮l) were
supplemented with a 50% slurry of the agarose-conjugated antiflag antibody (20 ␮l) and shaken overnight at 4°c. immunoadsorbed receptor was collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 4°c and
1000g, and the precipitated beads were washed four times by resuspension in 1 ml of buffer a (9.1 mm na2hpo4, 1.7 mm nah2po4, and
150 mm nacl, adjusted to ph 7.40 with naoh) and subsequent
centrifugation.
samples for electrophoresis were heated at 65°c for 5 min before
loading on precast polyacrylamide gels from bio-rad laboratories
(ready gel tris-hcl, 10%). it has been shown previously that these
conditions do not induce aggregation of the m2 muscarinic receptor
from sf9 cells (park and wells, 2003). resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (bio-rad laboratories, 0.45
␮m) in a mini trans-blot transfer cell (bio-rad laboratories). the
membranes were then treated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, anti-ha antibody for 2 h at a dilution of 1:1000. proteins

of dissociation of the latter (stockton et al., 1983; lee and
el-fakahany, 1988; waelbroeck et al., 1988). homotropic cooperativity in the binding of orthosteric ligands has been
inferred from noncompetitive effects between the antagonists
n-methyl scopolamine and quinuclidinyl benzilate in studies
at thermodynamic equilibrium. a quantitative description of
the data requires four interacting sites, presumably within
a tetramer (wreggett and wells, 1995; park et al., 2002; ma
et al., 2007). when the receptor is purified as a monomer, the
same antagonists bind in a competitive manner (park and
wells, 2003; ma et al., 2007). homotropic cooperativity
among four orthosteric sites also can account for the guanyl
nucleotide-sensitive binding patterns revealed by muscarinic
agonists, which raises the possibility that cooperativity has a
role in the signaling process (wreggett and wells, 1995;
chidiac et al., 1997; ma et al., 2007).
the notion that noncompetitive effects denote cooperativity within an oligomer presupposes that muscarinic ligands
such as n-methyl scopolamine, quinuclidinyl benzilate, and
various agonists bind exclusively to the orthosteric site. also,
it generally is assumed that the effect of an allosteric modulator such as  xxxd2174xxx  on the dissociation of a supposed
orthosteric ligand such as n-methyl scopolamine is strictly
intramolecular. the interpretation of such effects is less
clear, however, if the ligands are less than wholly selective
for one site or the other. although  xxxd2174xxx  seems to recognize only the allosteric site (waelbroeck, 1994; ellis and
seidenberg, 1999), the affinity of that site for orthosteric
ligands and the consequences of any such interaction are
unknown.
the present investigation was prompted by preliminary
evidence that the dissociation of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine
from the orthosteric site of the  xxxg448xxx  was slowed by
oxotremorine-m in a manner similar to that of  xxxd2174xxx .
the effect was mechanistically ambiguous, however, owing to
the presence of oligomers. two experimental tools therefore
have been used to examine whether supposed orthosteric
ligands affect dissociation of the radioligand via the allosteric
site or a neighboring orthosteric site. first, the effect has
been characterized in a preparation of monomeric m2 receptors purified from sf9 cells (park and wells, 2003). second,
the pharmacological specificity associated with the effect has
been examined by means of the allosteric ligand obidoxime,
which binds to the same site as  xxxd2174xxx  but has little effect
on the dissociation of n-methyl scopolamine from the orthosteric site (ellis and seidenberg, 1992). the results indicate
that compounds commonly viewed as orthosteric ligands can
bind to the allosteric site and mimic  xxxd2174xxx  in their effect
on the binding of n-methyl scopolamine.

the variable bobsd in eq. 1 represents the total binding of n-[3h]methyl
scopolamine (p) at the total concentration [p]t, and bsp is the corresponding value of specific binding. the parameter bmax represents
maximal specific binding, nh is the hill coefficient, and k is the
concentration of unbound radioligand that yields half-maximal occupancy of the receptor. the parameter ns represents the fraction of
unbound radioligand that appears as nonspecific binding, which was
approximately 0.012% for n-[3h]methyl scopolamine over the course
of the investigation (i.e., ns ⫽ 0.00012 ⫾ 0.00001, n ⫽ 30).

improved by the addition of a second exponential. the variable bobsd
represents total binding at time t after the addition of the allosteric
modulator to the pre-equilibrated mixture of receptor and radioligand. the parameters bt⫽0 and bt3⬁ represent binding immediately

fixed throughout at the value obtained for nonspecific binding at
equilibrium in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled n-methyl scopolamine, corrected as required for any difference in the concentration
of the radioligand. this restraint generally was without appreciable
effect on the goodness of fit, as indicated by the weighted sum of
squares, and it was required when the asymptote was not defined by
the data.

dose-dependent allosteric effects on the rate of dissociation of
n-[3h]methyl scopolamine were assessed in a manner similar to that
described previously (ellis and seidenberg, 1992). the analyses were
based on scheme 1, in which three ligands (a, b, and c) compete for
the allosteric site of a receptor (r) occupied at the orthosteric site by
a radiolabeled probe (p). if the allosteric ligands equilibrate rapidly
with the receptor on the time scale of the binding assay, the observed
rate constant for dissociation of the probe is given by

the parameter kp in eq. 4 is the first-order rate constant for dissociation of the probe when the allosteric site is vacant, and the
parameters ka, kb, and kc are the corresponding constants when the
allosteric site is occupied by ligand a, b, or c, respectively. the
quantity [rp]t is defined by the equation of state for receptor bound
with probe at the orthosteric site; that is,

where [a], [b], and [c] represent the free concentrations of the
allosteric ligands, and the parameters ka, kb, and kc represent the
equilibrium dissociation constants for the interaction of each ligand
with the allosteric site (e.g., [a][rp]/[arp] ⫽ ka). the difference
between free and total concentration was negligible at the concentrations used in the assays. likewise, the ratio [arp]/[rp]t can be
expressed as

in eq. 2, kobsd and k0 represent rate constants for the dissociation of
n-[3h]methyl scopolamine. further details are described below. the
parameters y[l]⫽0 and y[l]3⬁ represent the asymptotic values of
kobsd/k0, and ec50 is the concentration at which ligand l achieves a
half-maximal reduction in kobsd/k0.
net dissociation of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine was analyzed in

scheme 1. dissociation of a radioligand from the orthosteric site of a
receptor in the presence of three ligands that compete for a common
allosteric site. the radioligand was n-[3h]methyl scopolamine (p). the
allosteric ligands included various combinations of  xxxd2174xxx  or oxotremorine-m (a), obidoxime (b), and unlabeled n-methyl scopolamine
(c). further details are described under analysis of data.

were visualized by chemiluminescence using reagents and film purchased from ge healthcare (ecl, hyperfilm mp). densitometry
was performed on images that were digitized at a resolution of 200
dots per inch, and the intensities of the bands were quantified using
imagej (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).
binding assays. for binding at equilibrium, n-[3h]methyl scopolamine and any unlabeled ligands were dissolved in buffer b (250
mm hepes, 0.8 mm edta, 10 mm mgcl2, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, adjusted to ph 7.40 with naoh) supplemented with 0.1% digitonin and 0.02%  xxxd1685xxx . an aliquot (50 ␮l)
was added to a sample of the purified receptor (3 ␮l) in a polypropylene microcentrifuge tube, and the reaction mixture was incubated
at 30°c for 45 min. bound radioligand then was separated by applying an aliquot (50 ␮l) to a column of sephadex g-50 fine (0.8 ⫻ 6.5
cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer c (20 mm hepes, 20 mm nacl, 5
mm  xxxd2534xxx , and 1 mm edta, adjusted to ph 7.40 with naoh)
supplemented with 0.017% digitonin. the assays were performed in
triplicate. nonspecific binding was estimated in the presence of 1
mm unlabeled n-methyl scopolamine.
to measure the time course of dissociation, a solution of n-[3h]methyl
scopolamine in buffer b (1509–1651 ␮l) was added to a sample of the
purified receptor (91–99 ␮l) in polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes.
the final concentration of the radioligand was 6 to 10 nm. the
reaction mixture was incubated at 30°c for 45 min. two aliquots (50
␮l) then were removed and applied to sephadex g-50 as described
above to obtain an estimate of initial binding (i.e., t ⫽ 0). net
dissociation of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine was initiated by the addition of unlabeled n-methyl scopolamine either alone or together with
a second ligand being examined for its allosteric effect on binding of
the radioligand (i.e., oxotremorine-m, n-methyl scopolamine, obidoxime, or  xxxd2174xxx ). the final concentration of unlabeled n-methyl
scopolamine was 10 ␮m except in those assays when it was being
examined for its allosteric effect. incubation was continued at 30°c,
and duplicate aliquots (50 ␮l) were removed at different times and
applied to sephadex g-50 as described above. all concentrations
were corrected as required to accommodate an increase of 1 to 13% in
the volume of the reaction mixture upon the addition of the allosteric
modulator. nonspecific binding was measured in parallel assays
performed at equilibrium as described above. the final concentration
of the radioligand was essentially the same as that in the time
course, and any difference was accommodated by a linear correction
to the estimate of nonspecific binding.

with unlabeled n-methyl scopolamine alone at a concentration of 10
␮m, and those in the presence of an additional ligand or ligands. the
value of kobsd from the former trace has been designated k0 and was
used to normalize those from all other traces. the resulting values of

recovered primarily as a monomer, in accord with previous
reports (park and wells, 2003; ma et al., 2007). densitometric analyses indicated that most of the immunoreactive
material identified on western blots migrated as a single
band with a relative molecular mass of 58,000 ⫾ 3000 (n ⫽
7). comparatively faint bands corresponding to dimers and
larger oligomers accounted for the balance (fig. 1, lane 1;
table 1). the largely monomeric status of the purified
receptor was confirmed by the small effect of bs3, which
slowed only a minor fraction of the immunoreactive material (fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 3; table 1), and by the
negligible coimmunoprecipitation of receptors tagged with
the ha and flag epitopes (fig. 1, lane 2).
the  xxxg448xxx  is at least partly oligomeric in unprocessed extracts of sf9 cells (park and wells, 2003), which
therefore can serve as a positive control for cross-linking and
coimmunoprecipitation. receptors in the extract migrated as
a mixture of forms, and the relative molecular masses of the
major bands were as follows: 52,000 ⫾ 2000 (n ⫽ 5),
108,000 ⫾ 5000 (n ⫽ 4), 143,000 ⫾ 5000 (n ⫽ 4), and
277,000 ⫾ 31,000 (n ⫽ 5) (fig. 1, lane 4). only 22% of the
immunoreactive material was monomeric, and that was reduced to 1% after treatment with bs3 (table 1). approximately 90% of the cross-linked receptor migrated as if it were
a tetramer or larger oligomer (fig. 1, lane 6; table 1).
the complement of monomers in the purified preparation
was 88 and 71% before and after cross-linking, respectively
(table 1), and only 9% of the cross-linked, purified receptor

(10)

unlabeled n-methyl scopolamine was designated throughout as ligand c, and the concentration was entered as either 10 ␮m or a
higher value as appropriate. ligand b was obidoxime, and ligand a
was either oxotremorine-m or  xxxd2174xxx .
statistical procedures. all parameters were estimated by nonlinear regression. the data were weighted according to the standard
error (bobsd, eq. 1) or the error as estimated from the diagonal
element of the covariance matrix (kobsd, eq. 2 and 10). means are
presented together with the standard error. parametric values derived from a single analysis of one or more sets of data are presented
together with the errors as estimated from the covariance matrix. in
all figures, values plotted on the y-axis were normalized in the
context of the fitted model as described previously [i.e., eq. 6 in
chidiac et al. (1997)]. further details regarding the statistical procedures have been described previously (chidiac et al., 1997; ma et
al., 2007; and references therein).

(lanes 1 and 4), after immunoprecipitation with the agarose-coupled
anti-flag antibody (lanes 2 and 5), and after cross-linking with bs3
(lanes 3 and 6). extract from uninfected cells was used as a control (lanes

immunoprecipitate applied to lanes 2 and 5, the antibody was mixed with
a volume of sample that was 20-fold larger than that applied in the other

the dissociation was slowed appreciably by  xxxd2174xxx  (fig.
3e), oxotremorine-m (fig. 3c), and n-methyl scopolamine
(fig. 3a). at the highest concentrations used in the experiments, both n-methyl scopolamine (10 mm) and oxotremorine-m (32 mm) decreased kobsd by 3- to 4-fold: that is, from
0.038 min⫺1 to 0.013 min⫺1 (fig. 3a), and from 0.038 min⫺1
to 0.011 min⫺1 (fig. 3c), respectively.  xxxd2174xxx  effected a
20-fold decrease at a concentration of 1 mm (i.e., from 0.040
min⫺1 to 0.0018 min⫺1; fig. 3e). obidoxime caused a much
smaller, 1.5-fold decrease at a concentration of 100 mm (i.e.,
from 0.038 min⫺1 to 0.026 min⫺1; fig. 4) but reversed the
effects of the other three ligands (fig. 3, b, d, and f).
data from a series of experiments such as those illustrated
in figs. 3 and 4 were analyzed together in terms of scheme 1,
in which all ligands compete for a single allosteric site. the
fit of the model is illustrated in fig. 5, and the parametric
values are listed in table 2. mechanistic consistency was
enforced for all parameters except the affinity of obidoxime.
in that case, separate values of kl were assigned to data
acquired with obidoxime as the only unlabeled ligand in
addition to 10 ␮m n-methyl scopolamine and to data acquired with obidoxime plus  xxxd2174xxx , oxotremorine-m, or
higher concentrations of n-methyl scopolamine (i.e., ⬎10
␮m). the analysis therefore gave four estimates of kl for
obidoxime: one from the effect of obidoxime alone on the
dissociation of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine, and three inferred
from the effect of obidoxime in the presence of another ligand.
the latter values of kl are identified as kobi in table 2. if
binding is strictly competitive, as postulated in scheme 1, the
affinity of obidoxime is expected to be the same irrespective
of the nature of the assay.
the model affords a good description of the data, as illustrated by the fitted curves in fig. 5. among the 36 estimates
of kobsd/k0, 31 were within 5% of 1; of those, 17 were within
2% of 1. all ligands affected the dissociation of n-[3h]methyl
scopolamine, although the affinities of n-methyl scopolamine, oxotremorine-m, and obidoxime were comparatively

extent that the densitometric signal may have been nonlinear at higher levels of exposure, the fraction corresponding to
monomers is underestimated by the values listed in table 1.
in unprocessed extracts, approximately 47% of the hatagged receptor was precipitated by the anti-flag antibody
(fig. 1, lane 5); the corresponding value after purification
was only 4% (fig. 1, lane 2).
binding of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine and its modulation via the allosteric site. binding to the allosteric
site required concentrations up to 100 mm with the ligands
used in the present investigation. all assays therefore were
conducted at a comparatively high concentration of hepes.
under those conditions, n-[3h]methyl scopolamine bound to
an apparently homogeneous population of sites (nh ⬇ 1) with
an equilibrium dissociation constant of approximately 10 nm
(log k ⫽ ⫺8.02 ⫾ 0.03; fig. 2). the affinity was 2- to 3-fold
weaker than that measured previously at lower ionic
strength (park and wells, 2003). approximately 50% of the
sites were occupied by n-[3h]methyl scopolamine at the concentration used to monitor its dissociation from the receptor.
the net dissociation of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine was well
described by a single exponential under all conditions (fig.
3). reassociation of the radioligand was prevented by the
inclusion of unlabeled n-methyl scopolamine at a concentration of 10 ␮m, which was sufficient to block the orthosteric
site (fig. 2) without binding to the allosteric site (see below).
thus, the value of kobsd estimated in the presence of 10 ␮m
n-methyl scopolamine alone (i.e., k0) is expected to approximate the rate constant for dissociation of the radioligand
from an otherwise vacant receptor (i.e., kp). each experiment
included one such trace, and the mean value of k0 from
different estimates obtained over the course of the investigation is 0.036 ⫾ 0.001 min⫺1 (n ⫽ 28). individual values of k0
were in good agreement within the same experiment but
varied by up to 1.5-fold between different experiments
(0.029–0.043 min⫺1). all values of kobsd therefore were normalized to the corresponding value of k0 for subsequent
analyses.
four ligands were examined for their effect on the rate of
dissociation of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine: the known allosteric ligands  xxxd2174xxx  and obidoxime, the muscarinic agonist
oxotremorine-m, and the antagonist n-methyl scopolamine.

30-fold more potent than the other three compounds (table
2). saturating concentrations of  xxxd2174xxx  decreased kobsd by
at least 100-fold (ml ⬇ 1), whereas the effects of n-methyl
scopolamine and oxotremorine-m were 9.1-fold (ml ⫽ 0.89)
and 4.5-fold (ml ⫽ 0.78), respectively (table 2). in contrast,
the estimated decrease in kobsd at saturating concentrations
of obidoxime was only 1.1-fold (ml ⫽ 0.11). the latter value
is somewhat smaller than the 2.5- to 5.4-fold decrease reported previously for the muscarinic receptor in myocardial
membranes (ellis and seidenberg, 1992; tränkle and mohr,
1997).
the affinities of all four compounds exceeded 70 ␮m

below. the reaction mixture contained 10 mm magnesium,
which has been shown to compete with the compounds
w84 and chin3/6 for the allosteric site of the  xxxg448xxx 
in porcine ventricular membranes and to slow the dissociation of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine by 60% (burgmer et al.,
1998). the concentration dependence of the effect was
biphasic, with inflections at 0.40 mm and 1.6 mm mg2⫹.
neither value is sufficiently low to account for the weak
affinities of  xxxd2174xxx  and obidoxime at the concentration

data shown for obidoxime are the same in each panel. each experiment
represented by the closed symbols included a control (k0) and traces at
different concentrations of obidoxime in the presence of 10 mm nms (a,

difference between the dashed line and the accompanying fitted curve
illustrates the magnitude of the change effected by nms, oxotremorine-m, or  xxxd2174xxx  in the potency of obidoxime. further details regarding the analysis are described in the legend to table 2.

lamine for the allosteric site was unchanged from that
listed in table 2 (log kl ⫽ ⫺4.24 ⫾ 0.15; eq. 10).
owing to the differences in ml, sufficient concentrations of
obidoxime are expected to reverse the effect of n-methyl
scopolamine, oxotremorine-m, or  xxxd2174xxx  if binding is competitive (ellis and seidenberg, 1992). saturating concentrations are expected to return kobsd to the value that would be
observed with obidoxime alone. although saturation was precluded by the weak affinity (i.e., log kl ⫽ ⫺1.73, table 2),
it was approached in the case of obidoxime plus 10 mm
n-methyl scopolamine. as illustrated in fig. 5a, approximately 77% of the total effect expected of obidoxime was
achieved at the highest concentration used in the experiment
(i.e., 100 mm). the reversal is smaller in the presence of 32
mm oxotremorine-m (fig. 5b) or 1 mm  xxxd2174xxx  (fig. 5c),
but the available data are well described by the model.
the competitive nature of the reversal also is supported by
good agreement between the affinity obtained for obidoxime
alone (log kl ⫽ ⫺1.73 ⫾ 0.91, table 2) and that inferred from
its effect in the presence of an additional ligand (i.e., kobi in
table 2). values differ by 3.5-fold or less between pairs that
include obidoxime plus 10 mm n-methyl scopolamine, and by
1.4-fold or less with other combinations. the weighted sum of
squares is not increased significantly if the analysis represented in table 2 is repeated with one value of kl rather than
four (p ⫽ 0.089). although binding was comparatively weak
for all ligands except  xxxd2174xxx , the estimates of kobi are
defined to within a narrow tolerance by the substantial effects of n-methyl scopolamine, oxotremorine-m, and  xxxd2174xxx  on the potency of obidoxime. the magnitude of those
effects is illustrated by the differences between the dashed
and corresponding solid lines in fig. 5.
the values listed in table 2 were obtained with ml for
 xxxd2174xxx  fixed at 1. that constraint was imposed to avoid a
fitted value greater than 1 (i.e., ml ⫽ 1.07 ⫾ 0.02), which has
no physical correlate. when analyzed in terms of eq. 2, the
dose dependence of kobsd/k0 on  xxxd2174xxx  yields a hill coefficient of 1.23 ⫾ 0.26 and a lower asymptote indistinguishable
from 1 (i.e., y[l]3⬁ ⫽ 1.00 ⫾ 0.05). the decrease in kobsd/k0
therefore is somewhat steeper than can be accommodated by
eq. 10 at realistic values of ml. the constraint on ml is

accompanied by a significant increase in the sum of squares
(p ⫽ 0.00019). virtually all of the increase derives from the
data for  xxxd2174xxx  in the absence of obidoxime, which lie
above the values predicted by the model (fig. 5c). the fitted
curves otherwise are superimposable with those shown in
fig. 5, and the values of other parameters are essentially the
same as those listed in table 2. the reason for this anomaly
in the effect of  xxxd2174xxx  is unclear.

affinities of ligands for the allosteric site, estimated in terms of
scheme 1
the data represented in fig. 5 were analyzed simultaneously in terms of scheme 1
to obtain the parametric values listed in the table. values of kl and ml (l ⬅ a, b,
or c in eq. 10) were assigned to each ligand as follows: in the case of nms,
oxotremorine-m, and  xxxd2174xxx , single values of each parameter were common to all
of the relevant data; in the case of obidoxime, a single value of ml was common to all
of the data, and separate values of kl were assigned to data acquired with obidoxime
taken alone and in the presence of 10 mm nms, 32 mm oxotremorine-m, or 1 mm
 xxxd2174xxx . the latter values are listed in the table under kobi, where the value of kl
for obidoxime alone is reprinted in brackets for the purpose of comparison. a
separate value of kp/k0 was assigned to the data from each experiment, and the mean
is 1.01 ⫾ 0.01 (n ⫽ 36). the value of ml for  xxxd2174xxx  was fixed at 1 during the fitting
process, as described in the text. the weighted sum of squares was not increased
appreciably when the affinity of obidoxime was estimated as 1 parameter rather
than 4 (p ⫽ 0.089), and the resulting value of kl is ⫺1.73 ⫾ 0.08.

interpret if those ligands also bound to the allosteric site and
mimicked the effects of  xxxd2174xxx . that possibility therefore
has been examined using a preparation of monomers, which
are expected to exhibit only heterotropic effects. ha- and
flag-tagged m2 receptors extracted from coinfected sf 9
cells were predominantly oligomeric, as indicated by their
degree of coimmunoprecipitation and their electrophoretic
mobility before and after cross-linking with bs3. in contrast,
and in agreement with previous results (park and wells,
2003; ma et al., 2007), the affinity-purified receptor was
predominantly monomeric. there was little coimmunoprecipitation of the tagged adducts, and most of the receptor
migrated as a monomer after treatment with bs3.
both oxotremorine-m and n-methyl scopolamine slowed
the dissociation of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine, which bound
only to the orthosteric site at the concentration of 6 to 10 nm
used in the assays. whereas the affinity of the radioligand for
the orthosteric site was 10 nm, that estimated for the allosteric
site was at least 3 orders of magnitude weaker, as discussed
below. inasmuch as monomers are not expected to exhibit
intermolecular interactions between orthosteric sites, the effect of either compound on the dissociation of n-[3h]methyl
scopolamine was heterotropic in nature.
n-methyl scopolamine, oxotremorine-m,  xxxd2174xxx , and
obidoxime all seem to affect the dissociation of n-[3h]methyl
scopolamine via a common allosteric site. scheme 1 provides
a good description of the data, which yield four estimates for
the affinity of obidoxime: one estimate from the dependence
of kobsd on the concentration of obidoxime alone (kl) and
three from the potency of obidoxime in the presence of nmethyl scopolamine, oxotremorine-m, or  xxxd2174xxx  (kobi).
the fitted values of kl and kobi are indistinguishable, and
obidoxime therefore was competitive with respect to the
other three ligands. in the case of obidoxime and  xxxd2174xxx ,
the present results are consistent with the results of an
earlier study in which the interaction between those two
ligands also was found to be competitive (ellis and seidenberg, 1992). it follows that n-methyl scopolamine and
oxotremorine-m bound to the same site as  xxxd2174xxx  and
obidoxime.
the affinities of both obidoxime and  xxxd2174xxx  for the
allosteric site of the radioligand-occupied receptor were comparatively weak. the present values of 19 mm and 76 ␮m
obtained for kl are at least 260-fold greater than those
reported for the effect of obidoxime and  xxxd2174xxx , respectively, on the dissociation of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine from
the  xxxg448xxx  in rat myocardial membranes (ellis and
seidenberg, 1992). in a more recent study on porcine myocardial membranes, the effect of obidoxime was found to be
biphasic, with inflections at 23 ␮m and 0.96 mm (tränkle
and mohr, 1997). in addition, the maximal decrease effected
by obidoxime in kobsd was only 11% in the present investigation; in contrast, a decrease of at least 50% has been found in
studies on the receptor in myocardial membranes (ellis and
seidenberg, 1992; tränkle and mohr, 1997).
the origin of such differences in the properties of obidoxime and  xxxd2174xxx  remains unclear. they apparently are
not caused by magnesium, and the reported effects of ionic
strength on the affinity of  xxxd2174xxx  are comparatively small
(pedder et al., 1991). they may be related to the state of
aggregation of the receptor, which can exist as oligomers in
whole cells (goin and nathanson, 2006), in detergent-solubi-

m2 muscarinic receptors from porcine atria and baculoviral-infected sf9 cells exhibit noncompetitive effects in the
binding of orthosteric ligands (wreggett and wells, 1995;
park et al., 2002; ma et al., 2007). the data can be described
in terms of cooperative interactions among at least four sites,
implying that the receptor is tetrameric or larger. in the
same vein, a complex containing the ha-, c-myc-, and flagtagged forms of the  xxxg448xxx  could be purified from sf9
cells coinfected with the three baculoviruses (park and wells,
2004), suggesting that the receptor is at least trimeric. in
addition, the  xxxg448xxx  has been shown by cross-linking to
form tetramers when purified as a monomer from sf9 cells
and reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles (ma et al., 2007).
as inferred from cooperativity, the notion of a tetramer is
based on the assumption that ligands such as n-methyl scopolamine and oxotremorine-m bind only to the single orthosteric site within the cluster of transmembrane helices (cf.
hulme et al., 2003; rasmussen et al., 2007). this disregards
the possibility of an interaction with the allosteric site recognized by compounds such as  xxxd2174xxx , but the preference
of ligands for the two sites is not necessarily absolute. allosteric modulators of the  xxxg448xxx  are structurally diverse,
and compounds such as uh-ah 37 (ellis and seidenberg,
1999), methoctramine (waelbroeck, 1994; boselli and grana,
1995), and af-dx 116 (lee and el-fakahany, 1991; waelbroeck, 1994) also may bind to the orthosteric site. conversely,
m2-selective antagonists, such as af-dx 384, that bind to the
orthosteric site (miller et al., 1991) also may bind to the
allosteric site (tränkle et al., 1998).
a tetramer of the  xxxg448xxx  would contain four orthosteric and four allosteric sites, with considerable potential for
homo- and heterotropic cooperativity. noncompetitive effects
between supposed orthosteric ligands would be difficult to

the low-affinity form of the muscarinic receptor in myocardial membranes, as determined at equilibrium in the presence of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine (0.66 ␮m; ehlert, 1988),
and it approximates the corresponding value obtained for the
reconstituted  xxxg448xxx  in the presence of [3h]quinuclidinyl benzilate (0.35 mm; ma et al., 2007). oxotremorine-m
therefore reveals comparatively little if any difference between its estimated affinity for the allosteric site of the
monomer and its affinity for at least some of the presumed
orthosteric sites. it follows that the inhibitory effect of oxotremorine-m on the binding of an antagonist such as
n-[3h]methyl scopolamine may derive in part from an interaction at the allosteric site. such an effect would have implications for our understanding of the gtp-sensitive heterogeneity revealed by agonists at the muscarinic and perhaps
other g protein-coupled receptors.

lized preparations (park et al., 2001; park and wells, 2004),
and after reconstitution (ma et al., 2007). such aggregation
seems to have functional consequences, which may extend to
the binding and effects of allosteric ligands.
under some conditions, the detergent-solubilized  xxxg448xxx  exhibits a pattern of noncompetitive behavior wherein the
binding of [3h]quinuclidinyl benzilate is inhibited by
n-methyl scopolamine at sites that are inaccessible to the
latter (park et al., 2002; colozo et al., 2007). the effect can be
described quantitatively in terms of cooperativity among four
or more interacting and presumably orthosteric sites (park et
al., 2002). such effects are absent from preparations of purified monomers (park and wells, 2003; ma et al., 2007), but
they are recovered upon reconstitution of the receptor in
phospholipid vesicles (ma et al., 2007). the parametric values reported here for  xxxd2174xxx  and obidoxime pertain to the
allosteric site of a monomer. if the receptor in myocardial
membranes is predominantly oligomeric, the values of kl
and ml in those preparations may be affected by modes of
cooperativity and other factors that are absent from a
monomer.
the allosteric effects of n-methyl scopolamine and oxotremorine-m raise the possibility that such interactions contribute to events heretofore assumed to occur at the orthosteric site. the affinity of n-methyl scopolamine for the
allosteric site of the ligand-occupied monomer was 2.8 mm
(kl, table 2). its affinity for the allosteric site of the vacant
monomer is unknown, but a cooperativity factor (␣) of 46 has
been estimated for the degree of negative heterotropic cooperativity between  xxxd2174xxx  and n-[3h]methyl scopolamine
at the cardiac muscarinic receptor (tränkle et al., 1999).
 xxxd2174xxx  is one of the more efficacious allosteric modulators
of n-[3h]methyl scopolamine (mohr et al., 2003); accordingly,
the value of ␣ for the heterotropic interaction between nmethyl scopolamine and its radiolabeled analog seems unlikely to exceed 46. it follows that the equilibrium dissociation constant for the binding of n-methyl scopolamine to the
allosteric site of the vacant monomer is likely to exceed 0.06
mm (i.e., kl/␣).
based on the lower limit estimated above, the affinity of
n-methyl scopolamine for the allosteric site is at least 2800fold weaker than its affinity for the orthosteric site [10 nm,
fig. 2; ⱕ 22 nm, ma et al. (2007)]. it is at least 1000-fold
weaker than the affinity that emerges from the noncompetitive inhibition of [3h]quinuclidinyl benzilate by n-methyl
scopolamine at the  xxxg448xxx  solubilized in  xxxd1685xxx -nacl
[46 nm, park et al. (2002)] or reconstituted in phospholipid
vesicles [27 nm, ma et al. (2007)]. these considerations suggest that the noncompetitive effect of n-methyl scopolamine
at concentrations below 10 ␮m derives entirely from interactions among orthosteric sites. such a system is potentially
complex, however, and the combined effect of several cooperativity factors on the affinity of n-methyl scopolamine for the
allosteric sites is unknown.
in the case of oxotremorine-m, the affinity for the allosteric
site of the ligand-occupied monomer was approximately 5
mm (kl, table 2). if the value of ␣ for the heterotropic
interaction with n-[3h]methyl scopolamine is assumed once
again to be 46 or less, the equilibrium dissociation constant
for oxotremorine-m at the allosteric site of the vacant receptor is 0.11 mm or more. that is approximately 170-fold
greater than the dissociation constant of oxotremorine-m for

allosteric site of the m2 muscarinic receptor
