 xxxd3434xxx  (tft), a potent anticancer agent, inhibits  xxxg2366xxx  (ts) and is
incorporated into the dna, both events resulting in cell death. cell death induction related to dna
damage often involves activation of p53. we determined the role of p53 in tft cytotoxicity and cell
death induction, using, respectively, the sulforhodamine b-assay and facs analysis, in a panel
of cell lines with either wild type, inactive, or mutated p53. neither tft cytotoxicity nor cell death
induction changed with tft exposure in cell lines with wt, inactive or mutated p53. conclusion:
sensitivity to tft is not dependent on the expression of wt p53.

introduction
 xxxd3434xxx  (tft) is a thymidine analog which has been shown
to bypass resistance pathways for 5-fu derivatives in model systems.[1] tft
is given in combination with tpi, a specific inhibitor of  xxxg2365xxx  (tp) to increase tft bioavailability (figure 1). this combination,
tas-102, is currently tested as an oral chemotherapeutic agent in phase ii
studies.[2] tft has been shown to inhibit ts in its monophosphorylated
form [3] (figure 1). when further activated to its tri-phosphorylated form,
tft can be incorporated into the dna.[4,5] which will subsequently result
in dna damage.[6] subsequently, cell death induction will follow.
cell death induced by dna damaging agents is often dependent on p53,
which detects dna damage.[7] upon activation of p53, cell death will be
induced by activation of the main executors of apoptosis, the caspases. in
this study we describe the role of p53 in tft cytotoxicity.

figure 1 figure 1 molecular structures of tft and tpi. tft can be degraded by  xxxg2365xxx  (tp) to tf-thymine. tpi inhibits this degradation. thymidine kinase (tk) activates tft to
its mono-phosphorylated form (tf-tmp). tft-mp can inhibit  xxxg2366xxx  (ts). when tft is
further activated it can be incorporated into the dna.

materials and methods
the cell lines and stable transfected derivatives used in this study were
described before.[8−11] these are: widr (parental, mutant p53), widr b
(transfected with wt p53), lovo92 (parental, wt p53), lovo li (functional
inactive p53), lovo 175x2 (transfected with mutant p53). to evaluate tft
cytotoxicity, the sulforhodamine b-assay was used.[12] cells were exposed to
tft for 72 hours after which tca (final concentration 10%) was added.
cells were stained with srb (0.4%) and dye was dissolved in tris (10 mm).
cell death induced by tft was determined by staining cells with  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide (pi) stain and analyzed by facs.[9] the sub-g1 peak was used as
indication for cell death induction.
results
tft was active in both parental cell lines widr and lovo92 (figure 2).
cytotoxicity induced in the parental cell lines was compared to that of the
derivatives. tft cytotoxicity did not increase when wt p53 was transfected to

widr (widr b). also, cytotoxicity did not decrease when p53 was mutated
or functionally inactive (lovo 175 x2 and lovo li).
since p53 plays an important role in the induction of cell death after
dna damage induction by cytotoxic agents, the sub-g1 peak as a measure
of apoptotic cells was analyzed. in both the parental cell lines widr and
lovo92, cell death was induced (figure 3). this induction of cell death
was not increased when cells were transfected with wt p53 in widr cells.
in lovo92 cells, overexpression of a mutated and functionally inactive p53
did not result in a decrease in tft induced cell death and rather a slight,
non significant increase was observed in this cell line.

discussion
in this report, we show that the activity of tft is not dependent on the
presence of wildtype p53. tft cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction (subg1) did not differ between the cell lines with wild type, mutated, or nonfunctional p53.
the tumor suppressor gene p53 is absent or mutated in 85% of colorectal cancer.[13] mutations in p53 have been related with resistance to
chemotherapy.[14] in the whole nci cell line panel [15] and more specifically colon cancer cells it was shown that when p53 was mutated, cells were
less sensitive to  xxxd2134xxx  and ts-directed antifolates.[15,16] since tft cytotoxicity and cell death induction did not alter between cells with different p53
status, this can be a major advantage over 5-fu and antifolates.
many dna damage inducing agents in current use have been reported
to induce apoptosis in a p53 dependent manner, including 5-fu.[17] previously we demonstrated that in lovo cells, cell death seemed to be apoptotic
in contrast to widr which showed less apoptotic features after exposure
to 5-fu and antifolates.[18] since tft sensitivity was not dependent on p53
expression, p53 related repair of dna damage may not be the main mechanism of cell death induced in the panel of cell lines we have tested. other
reported mechanisms of tft have been inhibition of ts. however, in the
same panel of cell lines we observed a difference in sensitivity to antifolates
and 5-fu.[10,11,18] maybe another mechanism than ts inhibition is also important in tft activity.
bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that can be inactivated by pro-apoptotic
bcl-2 family members that are induced by p53, thereby destabilizing mitochondria causing the release of apoptogenic factors. many gastrointestinal
tumors have been reported to have mutated or absent bcl-2. previously,
widr cells were shown to lack bcl-2 expression, while lovo92 cells have
functional bcl-2.[18] since tft sensitivity and cell death induction between
widr and lovo92 cells did not vary much, we conclude that bcl-2 itself is
likely not a crucial regulator for tft-induced apoptosis, although other bclfamily members could be important in this process.
several studies have suggested that death receptor-dependent apoptosis
might also play a role in drug sensitivity.[19] since tft induced p53 independent cell death, the death receptor pathway may play a role, perhaps involving fas or  xxxg2303xxx  (trail). in conclusion,
tft induced p53 independent cell death, in contrast to 5-fu. these findings provide a basis for further investigation of tft as therapy against colorectal cancer.
