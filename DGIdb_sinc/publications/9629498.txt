abstract

we have studied the changes in bone marrow and spleen globin chain
levels after in vivo hemin and  xxxd2385xxx  treatment of hereditarily anemic
belgrade laboratory(ba5) rats. the increase of globin chains was detected
in the bone marrow and in the spleen when b h animals were treated with
either iron or hemin. the analysis of changes in a-and p-globin chain ratios
revealed the distinctive role of these molecules in regulating globin chain
status. irondextran, as expected, ameliorated the imbalance of a-and pglobin chains in the b h rat spleen. on the other hand, hemin, as we have
hypothesized in the accompanying paper, leads to a surplus of p-globin
chains in the bone marrow, similar to the one detected in the b h rat spleen.
therefore, an iron-rich microenvironment has a stimulatory effect, while a
hemin-rich microenvironment has an inhibitory effect on erythropoiesis.
introduction
the belgrade laboratory (wb) rat suffers from hereditary microcytic,
hypochromic anemia inherited as an autosomal trait (1,2).the anemia is

accompanied by reticulocytosis (2), a decreased amount of hemoglobins
(hbs) and globins in red blood cells (rbcs) (3,4), defective and reduced

globin synthesis (5), and decreased iron uptake by reticulocytes (5-10).

changed when compared to the values found in normal (+/+) rat rbc due to

a lower level of aslobins (3). the bone marrow of b/b rat, as the primary site
of erythropoiesis, has a decreased globin polypeptide share and correct
coordination of globin chain synthesis (accompanying paper). in spite of the
fact that the b h rat has developed a splenomegaly, the anemia is not corrected. spleen erythroid cells are defective in differentiation, containing a
decreased share of globin polypeptides as compared to the control rats. the
spleen cells of m, rats are also characterized by a drastic imbalance of a-to
p-globin polypeptides, resulting in the p-globin chain surplus (accompanying
paper).
it has been proposed that the primary cause of anemia in the wb rat
is the impaired iron uptake into the cell (7-11). the b reticulocyte defect has
been particularlywell characterized and appears to be a failure to transport
iron out of the transfemn cycle endosome (8,9). recently, the b mutation has
been attributed to a missense mutation in the gene encoding the putative iron
transporter protein nramp2 (12). the very same mutation has been previously detected in mk (microcytic anemia) mice, where both gastrointestinal
and cellular iron uptake are impaired (13,14). diminished iron acquisition by
various cells was observed, thus suggesting that the genetic defect leads to
a widely expressed abnormality in the structure and/or function of a memthis has been supported, among others, by
brane carrier for iron (1i).

after irondextran treatment were functionally mature rbcs produced with
increased globin content. the analysis of changes in a- and p-globin chain

ratios revealed the distinctive role of these molecules in regulating globin
chain synthesis. while in vivo administered  xxxd2385xxx  normalized the ato p-globin chain ratio, hemin provoked p-globin chain surplus in erythropoietically active tissues.

materials and methods
animals. adult laboratory rats of wistar strain (+/+) (3 months old)
were used in all experiments. anemic belgrade laboratory ( b h ) rats were
obtained from the original belgrade colony (4) by crosses between either

animals (+h).
three groups of mi rats were investigated: 1) b h rats; 2) irondextran
treated b h rats: b h animals treated intraperitoneally with irondextran
(fermm-lek, ljubljana, slovenia), 3.5 mg per week starting from the 30th day
after birth up to the third month of life, the time of sacrifice; 3) hemin treated
b/b rats: 4-week-old b h animals were treated with hemin (hemin-chloride;
sigma chemical company, st. louis, mo, usa). stock solution was made
up as follows (19): 30 mg of hemin was dissolved in 400 pl 0.2 n koh and
neutralized by adding 600 pl h,o and 100 pl 1 m tris-ci, ph 7.8. the final
dilution with isotonic saline (0.25 ml per rat) was made immediately before
administration. preliminary experiments demonstrated a cumulative toxic
effect of hemin when it was administeredat 13 pg/g of body weight weekly for
1 month, which has been considered the maximal non-toxic single dose for

mice (20).

in the experiments presented here, the prolonged treatment of rats
was successfully completed (no deaths), since the hemin dose per rat was

the whole treatment. the treatment with hemin [divided into two intramuscular (im) injections per week] was conducted for 1 month, starting with 13 pg/g
body weight, and decreasing to 7.5 pg/g body weight weekly at the end of

results
in vivo hemin effect on b/b rat rbcs. we treated b/b rats with
hemin in order to test its effect on correcting the anemic state. the effect of
this in vivo treatment was monitored on globin polypeptide status in peripheral rbcs. the globin share in the total soluble (s-100) proteins and a-to
p-globin ratio was determined by scanning densitometry and subsequent

rbc s-lo0 proteins was not statistically significant, e.g. 57 f 5% before and
60 f 6% after treatment (fig. 1). moreover, the a-to p-globin ratio in rbcs

isolated from hemin-treated b h rats was similar to one found in b h rats, 0.6

interest to examine whether  xxxd2385xxx  and hemin in vivo treatment of b h
rats affects progenitors with an active pattern globin gene expression. therefore, we have further analyzed the effect of  xxxd2385xxx  or hemin on globin
chain status in the erythropoietic tissues of the b h rat, i.e. bone marrow and

spleen. surprisingly, both irondextran and hemin in vivo treatment increased
globin share in the b h rat erythroid tissues (fig. 2a and fig. 3a). after in
vivo irondextran treatment, bone marrow globins rose from 33 f 3% to 42 f

7%, while in vivo hemin treatment increased globin share to 44%. in the b h
rat spleen this increase was even more significant, rising from 26 f 5% to
46 f 7% after  xxxd2385xxx  treatment, and to 43 f 1% after hemin treatment.

the a- to &globin ratio after in vivo treatment of b/b rats with
iron-dextranor hemin. since both irondextran and hemin increased total
globin level in bone marrow and spleen, the lack of hemin effect on peripheral
rbc remained intriguing. one possibility is that hemin treatment increases
total globin chain level in erythroid tissues which do not form functional hb
molecules. therefore, we looked for a- to p-globin chain ratios in bone
marrow and spleen cells.
a coordinated increased in both a-and p-globins was observed in the

bone marrow of  xxxd2385xxx  treated b h rats, thus, a- to p-globin ratio was
not significantly changed (fig. 26). however, increased total globin share
after hemin treatment was solely due to the elevated p-globin chains portion
(fig. 28). thus, in vivo hemin treatment reversed the a-to p-globin polypeptide ratio in the b h rat bone marrow; namely, the a-to p-globin ratio of 1.3 f
0.2 in the b/b rat bone marrow was 1.1 f 0.3 after  xxxd2385xxx  treatment, but

dropped to 0.6 in the hemin treated b/b rat bone marrow.
since dramatic a-to p-globin imbalance has been detected in the b h
rat spleen (0.3 f 0.1; accompanying paper), it was of particular interest to
study the roles of irondextran and hemin in coordination of the globin chain
synthesis in this tissue.
comparison of a-and p-globin contents in the b/b rat spleen after ii jndextran treatment revealed a significant improvement of both types of globin

 xxxd2385xxx  treatment resulted in the increased globin share in the b h rat
spleen and more importantly, in partial correction of the a- to p-globin chain
ratios from 0.3 f 0.1 to 0.7 f 0.1. on the other hand, after hemin treatment

discussion
the stimulatory effect of in vivo  xxxd2385xxx  treatment on globin
synthesis was observed in all tissues analyzed (ref. 3 and this paper). it has
been demonstrated previously that irondextran treatment corrects severe
anemia in b/b rats by increasing all hematological parameters (rbc count,
hb, mcv, mch, pcv, etc.) (1 5-18). this implies that intraperitoneally administered irondextran partially overcomes gastrointestinal and cellular barriers
in the b/b rat. furthermore, the b mutation has recently been attributed to a
missense mutation in the gene encoding the putative iron transporter nramp2

(12). diminished iron acquisition by various cells was observed, suggesting
that the genetic defect leads to a widely expressed abnormality in the structure and/or function of a membrane carrier for iron (13).
it is not clear how irondextran is taken up by cells. however, it is well
known that although the transferrin receptor is the main pathway of iron
transport into the cell, other routes exist by which iron can enter mammalian
cells (26-28). the in vitr0 studies demonstrated that an increase in heme and
globin synthesis in the b/b rat reticulocyte might be achieved by bypassing
transferrin iron delivery with a chelator, ferric-salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl
hydrazone (fe-sih) (29). likewise, in vivo  xxxd2385xxx  leads to the amelioration of the imbalanced state of globins in peripheral blood (3) and spleen
of the anemic b/b rat. this points to the crucial role of iron in correlating
globin synthesis. the analysis of globin chain biosynthesis in iron deficient
anemia revealed that the synthesis of a-globin chains is decreased (30). to
date, only the role of iron in coordination of transferrin receptor, ferritin, and
erythroid-specific 6-aminolevulic acid synthase (ealas) synthesis has been
demonstrated at the molecular level (31,32).

in vitro iron supply by iron-sih does not restore globin production to
normal levels in the b/b rat reticulocyte (29) and we observed the same after

in vivo irondextran treatment of these animals. it has recently been demonstrated that iron uptake by a non-transferrin route is also affected in the b h

rat reticulocyte (lo), which may account for the incomplete restoration of
globin synthesis in b h rat cells after in vivo irondextran treatment.
in vivo hemin treatment of b h rats had no effect on rbc globin content. in accordance with the globin level data are the hematological parameters which were not changed after the in vivo hemin treatment of b h rats
(33). it is interestingto note that increased globin polypeptide synthesis was
obtained after in vifm incubation of the b h rat reticulocytes with hemin (34).

in these experiments, however, only posttranscriptional steps are influenced
by hemin treatment (34). it should be noted that the same effect was not
obtained with control reticulocytes (34).
the analysis of bone marrow and spleen after in vivo hemin treated b h
rats demonstrated its stirnulatory effect on total globin portion. more precise
analysis revealed that hemin provoked globin imbalance in b h rat bone
marrow similar to the one found in the untreated b h rat spleen. this work
showed that in vivo hemin treatment provoked p-globin polypeptide surplus,
and suggests that hemin might be the cause for loss of sequential and coordinate expression of erythroid genes. in accordance with this study are our
analysis of erythropoiesis in b h rats after in vivo hemin treatment, namely,
increased rate of proliferation of erythroid progenitors after in vivo hemin
treatment in both bone marrow and spleen did not result in amelioration of
severe anemia (33). although hemin effect on globin gene expression has
been studied in nucleated mel cells (24), its role in coordination of globin
chain synthesis has not been investigated. in vivo hemin treatment of patients with acute variegate porphyria increased y-globin synthesis in the
blood erythroid progenitors (25).

zaric et al.

242

inefficacy of hemin in vivo treatment on globin status in the b/b rat
rbcs, in spite of its stimulatory effect in erythropoietic tissues, suggests that
cells with high levels of imbalanced globin chains scarcely reach mature
stages of differentiation.

taking into account the above mentioned in vivo effect of hemin on
human y-globin synthesis (25) and our data, one can envisage hemin as a
therapeutic agent. thus, it should be investigated whether hemin can up
regulate in vivo the synthesis of the q type of globins in cases of q-globin
deficiency.
in conclusion, as expected,  xxxd2385xxx  increased the total globin
content in the b h rat erythroid tissues (bone marrow and spleen) and more
importantly, ameliorated the imbalance of a-and q-globinchains in the b h
rat spleen. on the other hand, as we have hypothesized in the accompanying paper, hemin leads to a surplus of p-globin chains in the bone marrow
similar to that detected in the b h rat spleen. therefore, an iron-rich microenvironment has a stimulatory effect, while a hemin-rich microenvironment
has an inhibitory effect on erythropoiesis.
