5-aza-2ⴕ- xxxd1836xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx ) is widely used as a
potent inhibitor of dna methyltransferase. cells
treated with this drug show various phenomena such
as the reactivation of repressed genes, change in replication timing, and decondensation of heterochromatin. a number of studies using this drug have been
reported so far but it is still controversial whether
such changes are due to  xxxd1823xxx -induced demethylation itself or the side effects of the drug. here we
report that  xxxd1823xxx  treatment induces histone hyperacetylation in mouse centromeric heterochromatin
which normally contains methylated dna and hypoacetylated histones. treatment also affects the intranuclear distribution of  xxxg1034xxx 
( xxxg1034xxx ). however, histone hyperacetylation was not
observed in  xxxg644xxx -deficient cells
with a reduced level of genomic dna methylation. our
results suggest that  xxxd1823xxx -induced histone hyperacetylation is independent of dna demethylation and
that dna methylation is not essential for the maintenance of the histone hypoacetylated state in centromeric heterochromatin. © 2001 academic press

methylation of dna is a feature of silenced chromatin and is believed to be associated with various phenomena such as x inactivation, genomic imprinting
and the control of tissue-specific gene expression (1, 2).
methylation occurs at the fifth position of the cytosine
ring and the reaction is mediated by dna methyltransferases. there are two types of dna methyltrans1

ferases: de novo methyltransferases create the new
methylation pattern during the early stages of development (3, 4) and this pattern is stably maintained by
the maintenance methyltransferase (dnmt1) through
dna replication (5). many genes contain cpg islands
in their promotor regions and the methylation of these
regions leads to transcriptional repression (6). recently, it has been reported that methylated dna binding proteins form a complex containing histone
deacetylases (hdacs) and target the methylated genome regions to repress transcription via histone
deacetylation (7).
5-aza-2⬘- xxxd1836xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx ) is widely used for
studying the role of dna methylation in biological
processes in addition to being a clinical treatment for
certain leukemias (8). the drug is substituted for cytosine residues during dna replication and forms covalent bonds with dnmt1 which depletes its cellular
enzymatic activity and results in demethylation of
genomic dna.  xxxd1823xxx  treatment of cells leads to
changes in the intranuclear chromatin structures and
to events such as the reactivation of repressed genes
(9), the alteration of replication timing (10), and the
disruption of heterochromatin (11). however, it is not
clear whether such changes are due to the 5-azadcinduced demethylation itself or to methylationindependent side effects. a previous study has reported
that cells with targeted mutation of dnmt1 are more
resistant to the toxicity of  xxxd1823xxx  treatment and this
suggests the existence of a side effect derived from the
covalent trapping of dnmt1 at  xxxd1823xxx -substituted
dna (12). in addition,  xxxd1823xxx -substituted dna was
shown to form a highly stable complex with other nuclear proteins in vitro and in vivo (13).
in this paper, we report that  xxxd1823xxx  treatment induces histone hyperacetylation in mouse centromeric

materials and methods
cell culture and drug treatments. mouse m5s cells were kindly
provided by dr. m. sasaki (kyoto university) (14). cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (gibco brl) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (gibco brl) and grown in 35 mm
tissue culture plates which had microscope coverslips in the bottom
(p35gc-0-10-c, mattek corp.). when the cells reached 70⬃80%
confluency, they were treated with 8 ␮m  xxxd1823xxx  (sigma) for 24 h.
for treatment of m5s cells in g0 stage, cells were cultured in mem
containing 0.2% fbs for 48 h and incubated in  xxxd1823xxx  for an
additional 24 h.
immunostaining methods. the cells grown in 35-mm culture
dishes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs (10 min, 25°c),
washed, and then permeabilized with 0.5% triton x-100 in pbs (10
min, 25°c). after permeabilization, the cells were washed three
times with pbs (5 min, 25°c) and either stored in pbs containing
0.04% sodium azide at 4°c or used immediately for immunostaining.
for immunostaining, samples were incubated in blocking solution
(3% bsa, 0.1% tween 20, 4⫻ ssc) for 30 min at 37°c to reduce
nonspecific binding, and then in rabbit antiacetylated  xxxg1052xxx 
igg (10 ␮g/ml in 1% bsa, 0.1% tween 20, 4⫻ ssc) for 1 h at 37°c.
after three washes with pbs, samples were incubated with the
blocking solution for 30 min at 37°c, and then in 15 ␮g/ml goat
anti-rabbit igg conjugated with rhodamine for 1 h at 37°c. the same
procedure was used for rabbit anti-chicken  xxxg1034xxx  igg. antibodies
against all acetylated isoforms of histone h3 and h4 were purchased
from upstate biotechnology. the antibody against  xxxg1034xxx  was
kindly provided by dr. nakayama and dr. takami (miyazaki medical college) (15). wild-type and dnmt1-deficient cells (16) were
obtained by trypsinizing embryos at 8.5–9.5 days of gestation. cells
were fixed and permeabilized as described above, cytocentrifuged
onto glass slides, and subjected to immunostaining.
transfection of vectors. the egfp-fused mecp2 was constructed
by ligating the amplified full-length cdna into the eukaryotic expression vector pegfp-c1 (clontech), as described previously (17).
the egfp-fused mecp2 vector was transfected into m5s cells by
lipofectamine (gibco brl) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.

hyperacetylation was not observed in dnmt1deficient cells. these observations suggest that the

a standard protocol using the dig system (roche) (18). genomic
dna was prepared from control or  xxxd1823xxx -treated cells and 200 ng
dna of each were digested using the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme maeii (1 h, 50°c) (19) prior to performing the southern
blotting procedure. southern blots were probed with mouse major
satellite dna which had been labeled with digoxigenin-11-dutp
using nick translation (20).
imaging system. before imaging, samples were counterstained
with dapi (0.2 ␮g/ml; sigma), washed with pbs, and mounted in
90% glycerol containing an antifade reagent. the following deconvolution system was used: a zeiss axioplan2 mot epifluorescence
microscope equipped with a filter wheel system and cooled chargecoupled device camera (pentamax-1317-k1, princeton instruments,
inc.) controlled by a power macintosh 9600/200mp computer running on the software program iplab (signal analytics co.). images
on the same focal plane are shown in the figure. several images of
each cell were captured at different stage positions and then deconvolved by the software hazebuster (vaytek, inc.) as described previously (21).

results and discussion
 xxxd1823xxx  treatment induces histone hyperacetylation
preferentially at centromeric heterochromatin
centromeric heterochromatin, like an inactivated x
chromosome, is heavily methylated and hypoacetylated (22), and the transcriptional activities of genes
integrated in this region are often repressed (23). centromeric heterochromatin is a good target for studying
the mechanism of transcriptionally silenced chromatin
because it can be visualized with dapi as a densely
stained mass in the nucleus (fig. 1a, arrow) and the
behavior of its associated proteins can be easily followed using light microscopy.
initially, we visualized the distribution of acetylated
 xxxg1052xxx  in mouse m5s cells using a specific antibody. using a cooled ccd camera equipped with a
deconvolution system, images were captured throughout the section for each fluorescence channel and saved
onto a computer. each image in the same focal plane
was deconvolved and compared as shown in figs. 1– 4.
as shown in fig. 1b, acetylated  xxxg1052xxx  was detected as many discrete foci in the interphase nucleus.
however, this antibody did not recognize centromeric
heterochromatin or nucleoli which were densely
stained and unstained with dapi, respectively (figs.

1a and 1b, arrows). in mitotic chromosomes, acetylated  xxxg1052xxx  was also observed as discrete foci
throughout the chromosome arms except the in the
centromeric heterochromatin (figs. 1c and 1d, arrows). we then investigated the cells treated with
 xxxd1823xxx . the cells grown for 24 h in the presence of 8
␮m  xxxd1823xxx  revealed disruption of the centromeric
heterochromatin (fig. 1e). furthermore, histone hyperacetylation was induced at discrete domains in the
nucleus (fig. 1f). these hyperacetylated regions were
observed around the centromeric heterochromatin,
which were not disrupted partly, and located at
perichromosomal domains in mitotic chromosomes
(figs. 1g and 1h, arrows). these observations suggest
that these hyperacetylated regions correspond to parts
of the centromeric heterochromatin. in the images of
 xxxd1823xxx -treated cells (figs. 1e and 1f) the nucleoplasmic region and chromosome arms appear to be stained
less strongly. this is due to the strong fluorescence of
the histone hyperacetylated region preventing the relatively weaker nucleoplasmic fluorescence from being
detected in the whole nuclear images and the nucleoplasmic distribution of acetylated  xxxg1052xxx  is similar
to that in control cells (data not shown). these phenomena were induced after treatment with 4 ␮m
 xxxd1823xxx  for 24 h or 0.5 ␮m  xxxd1823xxx  for 1 week. the

same results were observed using the antibody to
acetylated histone h3 (data not shown). since the hyperacetylation induced by  xxxd1823xxx  was rare in quiescent cells synchronized at g 0 phase by serum starvation (data not shown), this drug has little effect on the
nuclear structure.
to evaluate the decreased level of dna methylation
in centromeric heterochromatin, cells expressing gfptagged methyl-cpg binding protein (mecp2) were
treated with  xxxd1823xxx . mecp2 was shown to recognize a
single methylated cpg sequence and to localize predominantly to the centromeric heterochromatin in
mouse cells (24). in untreated cells, gfp-mecp2
(green) localized in the centromeric heterochromatin
densely stained with dapi (blue), while localization of
this protein in the regions stained by anti-acetylated
 xxxg1052xxx  antibodies (red) was not observed (figs.
2a–2d). when the cells expressing gfp-mecp2 were
exposed to  xxxd1823xxx , strong fluorescence of gfp-mecp2
was still observed in the remaining centromeric heterochromatin and weaker fluorescence was dispersed
around it (figs. 2e, 2f, 2i, and 2j). histone hyperacetylation occurred in the same regions that the fluorescence of gfp-mecp2 was observed (figs. 2g, 2h,
2k, and 2l). thus histone hyperacetylation appears to
be closely associated with the methylation level, but
the degree of demethylation by  xxxd1823xxx  was not as
dramatic as expected. this was supported by the experiment where centromeric heterochromatin dna

in general, newly synthesized histones h3 and h4
are modified by acetylation at specific lysine residues
prior to their incorporation into chromatin (25). acetylated histones are deposited onto replicating dna and
histone deacetylation is thought to occur rapidly after
deposition (26, 27). as hdacs are believed to be responsible for histone hypoacetylation in centromeric
heterochromatin, we investigated the subnuclear distribution of  xxxg1034xxx , one of the known hdacs, and the
effect of  xxxd1823xxx  treatment on its localization. as
shown in fig. 3a, a number of small accumulated regions of  xxxg1034xxx  were distributed through the nucleus
(figs. 3a and 3b). these regions were not observed in
the centromeric heterochromatin densely stained with
dapi (figs. 3a and 3b, arrows). interestingly, in
 xxxd1823xxx -treated cells,  xxxg1034xxx  was strongly localized
in the centromeric heterochromatin (figs. 3c and 3d
arrows). it is interesting that  xxxd1823xxx  treatment induced aberrant localization of  xxxg1034xxx  to the centromeric heterochromatin where the histone hyperacetylation was induced. one possible explanation for this
phenomenon is that highly stable complexes were
generated between  xxxd1823xxx -substituted dna and

 xxxg1034xxx . it has previously been reported that 5-azadcsubstituted dna forms highly stable complexes with
nuclear proteins (13). it is possible that endogenous
 xxxg1034xxx  interacts with centromeric heterochromatin in
normal cells but that the interaction is too transient to
be detected by immunostaining and that incorporation
of  xxxd1823xxx  into centromeric heterochromatin dna
leads to trapping of excess  xxxg1034xxx  in this region as
detected in fig. 3d. this aberrant interaction of
 xxxg1034xxx  with  xxxd1823xxx -substituted dna might inhibit
the action of this enzyme on centromeric heterochromatin, resulting in histone hyperacetylation.
histone hyperacetylation of centromeric
heterochromatin is not observed
in dnmt1-deficient cells
we next investigated the distribution of acetylated
 xxxg1052xxx  in dnmt1-deficient cells to assess whether
 xxxd1823xxx -induced histone hyperacetylation is due to demethylation itself or to the aberrant interaction of
 xxxd1823xxx -substituted dna with proteins such as
 xxxg1034xxx . the level of genomic dna methylation in
dnmt1 deficient embryos is reduced to 30% of that in
normal embryos (16) and centromeric heterochromatin
sequences are hypomethylated in dnmt1-deficient es
cells (19). if  xxxd1823xxx -induced histone hyperacetylation
is due to dna demethylation, hyperacetylation of centromeric heterochromatin should also be observed in
dnmt1-deficient cells. cells prepared from dnmt1deficient embryos were stained with the antibody
against acetylated  xxxg1052xxx . as shown in figs. 4c
and 4d (arrows), the histone hypoacetylated state of
centromeric heterochromatin was the same as that for
normal cells (figs. 4a and 4b, arrows). this clearly
demonstrates that  xxxd1823xxx -induced histone hyperacetylation is independent of dna demethylation.
the main conclusion of this study is that  xxxd1823xxx 
induces histone hyperacetylation by a mechanism that
is independent of dna demethylation. the side effect
of this drug that causes the formation of stable complexes between  xxxd1823xxx -substituted dna and  xxxg1034xxx 
is thought to be responsible for this process. although
apparent hyperacetylation could only be detected in
centromeric heterochromatin of  xxxd1823xxx -treated cells
by microscopy, the same phenomenon might occur at
individual genomic loci. as histone hyperacetylation is
directly linked to transcriptional activity, the above
mechanism may contribute partly to the 5-azadcinduced phenomena reported previously, some of
which may have to be reassessed. our results also
provide some clues for the mechanism responsible for
the maintenance of the histone hypoacetylated state in
centromeric heterochromatin. previous reports have
strongly suggested that dna methylation is an important parameter for the regulation of histone hypoacetylation, and, recently, it was reported that dnmt1

could associate with hdac1 and 2 (28 –30). however,
the results reported in this paper show that neither
dna methylation nor dnmt1 are essential for histone
hypoacetylation in centromeric heterochromatin. multiple mechanisms, either dependent or independent of
dna methylation, may regulate the maintenance of
the histone hypoacetylated state in centromeric heterochromatin.
