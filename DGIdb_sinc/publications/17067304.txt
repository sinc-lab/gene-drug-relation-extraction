abstract
male and female sprague–dawley rats were administered quinpirole (1 mg ⁄ kg, i.p.) or saline once daily from postnatal day (p)1 to
p21. this drug treatment has been shown to produce long-term priming of the  xxxg656xxx . beginning on p62, rats were administered
the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (2.5 mg ⁄ kg) or saline twice daily (i.p.) for 28 days. one day after olanzapine treatment ceased,
rats were tested on the place and match-to-place versions of the morris water maze (mwm) for seven consecutive days. dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  priming was verified through a yawning behavioural test, a  xxxg656xxx -mediated event, before olanzapine was
administered as well as after olanzapine treatment and behavioural testing were complete. results showed that neonatal quinpirole
treatment induced d2 priming that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. on the mwm place version, d2-primed rats demonstrated
a significant impairment that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment, but olanzapine treatment to animals neonatally treated with
saline produced a significant deficit on the place version of the mwm. there were no significant deficits on the match-to-place
version. brain tissue analyses revealed that neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in hippocampal ngf,
bdnf and chat that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in
bdnf and chat in the frontal cortex that was unaffected by olanzapine treatment. these results show that olanzapine eliminates d2
receptor priming and cognitive impairment and also alleviates decreases in neurotrophins and acetylcholinergic markers produced by
d2 priming in the hippocampus.

introduction
the drug class of atypical antipsychotics has been shown to be
therapeutically useful for the treatment of schizophrenia. atypical
antipsychotics have advantages over drugs in the typical class of
antipsychotics because they avoid debilitating side-effects including
extrapyramidal motor effects. one of the most promising and
commonly prescribed atypical antipsychtoic drugs, olanzapine (trade
name zyprexa), gained fda approval in the united states in 1996.
like many atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine acts through antagonism of both the  xxxg656xxx  and the serotonin 5-ht2a
receptor (owen et al., 1984; krieckhaus et al., 1992; itokawa et al.,
1993). interestingly, olanzapine has also been shown to alleviate
cognitive impairment in schizophrenics tested on a number of
cognitive tasks (weiser et al., 2000; smith et al., 2001). however,
olanzapine has also been shown to produce weight gain, increase
glycosylated haemoglobin and increase triglycerides, more so than
other atypical and typical antipsychotic medications (lieberman et al.,
2005).

previous work from this laboratory has shown that neonatal
quinpirole treatment to rats given during the ﬁrst 3 weeks of life
results in long-term increases in sensitivity of the dopamine d2
receptor, a phenomenon called ‘priming’ (kostrzewa, 1995; nowak
et al., 2001; brown et al., 2004a,b, 2005). increased activation of
the  xxxg656xxx  has been shown to play a major role in
abnormal behaviours observed in schizophrenia (crow, 1979;
kokkinidis & anisman, 1980; castaneda et al., 1988; davis
et al., 1991). thus, it appears that neonatal  xxxg656xxx  priming
through neonatal quinpirole treatment may be a valid rodent model
of schizophrenia, although it is recognized that other neurotransmitter systems also play an important role in this disorder. this
increase in dopamine d2 sensitivity is not accompanied by an
increase in receptor proliferation (kostrzewa & brus, 1991, 1993,
1995, 2004). priming of the  xxxg656xxx  is veriﬁed through an acute
quinpirole injection in adulthood and the number of yawns are
counted for 1 h. yawning has been shown to be a d2 receptormediated behavioural event (cooper et al., 1989; eguibar et al.,
2003).
in a series of recent studies, we have shown that neonatal quinpirole
treatment results in cognitive impairment on the morris water maze
(mwm; brown et al., 2002, 2004a,b). interestingly, neonatal

quinpirole treatment results in signiﬁcant decreases in the neurotrophins  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf) and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (bdnf), as well as a decrease in  xxxg440xxx 
(chat) in the hippocampus which was alleviated by nicotine
treatment in adulthood (brown et al., 2004a, 2004b, 2006). both
ngf and bdnf are neurotrophic factors important in the development and maintenance of neurons and synaptic connectivity, and
chat is the enzyme that catalyses acetylcholine formation. all of
these proteins have been shown to be important in cognition and
maintenance of the septohippocampal pathway (dekker et al., 1992;
van der zee et al., 1995; schaaf et al., 2001).
recent studies have shown that olanzapine treatment produces
either cognitive enhancement or impairment, but these effects appear
to be dependent on administration methodology. wolff & leander
(2003) have shown that acute olanzapine treatment improves cognitive
function in normal rats tested on a delayed nonmatching-to-sample
task, but animals tested on the mwm during a drug-free washout
period after chronic olanzapine treatment produced cognitive deﬁcits
(terry et al., 2002). other studies have shown that olanzapine
increases hippocampal ngf and chat in rats after chronic administration of the drug through the animal’s drinking water (parikh et al.,
2004a). neurochemically, acute olanzapine treatment produces a
robust increase in acetylcholine release in the hippocampus of normal
adult rats (shirazi-southall et al., 2002). these results suggest that
olanzapine may be effective in alleviating cognitive impairment in d2primed rats, as these animals have altered  xxxg259xxx  and acetylcholinergic systems.
this study was designed to test the hypothesis that subchronic
treatment with the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine in adulthood will
alleviate increases in yawning behaviour, cognitive deﬁcits on the
mwm and signiﬁcant decreases in hippocampal ngf, bdnf and
chat produced by neonatal quinpirole treatment. the rationale for
choosing olanzapine was based on ﬁndings that have shown that drugs
in the atypical antipsychotic drug class are superior to typical
antipsychotic drugs with regard to cognitive function in schizophrenia
(meltzer & mcgurk, 1999) and that olanzapine alleviates certain types
of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (purdon et al., 2000, 2003;
mcgurk et al., 2004). olanzapine has also been shown to alleviate
decreases in neurotrophic factors in rodent models of schizophrenia
(fumagalli et al., 2003; angelucci et al., 2004). these same three
proteins were also analysed in the medial frontal cortex (mfc) and
medial cerebellar cortex because of the importance of the mfc in
mwm performance. the cerebellar cortex was utilized as a control.

materials and methods
subjects and subject assignment
a total of nine adult female and ﬁve adult male sprague–dawley rats
were obtained from harlan laboratories, inc. (indianapolis, in, usa)
and mated in plastic polycarbonate cages. the offspring of these
breeders were utilized in this experiment. from these litters, a total of
36 female and 32 male sprague-dawley rats were utilized in this
study. day of birth was counted as postnatal day (p)0. rats were
weaned at p21 and, after weaning, all animals were socially housed
two or three in each cage. one male and one female from each litter
were randomly assigned to each drug condition, and the litter was used
as the experimental unit. the rationale for the utilization of only one
subject in each group per litter is due to the fact that past ﬁndings have
shown that animals within a litter demonstrate behaviour that is too
similar to be counted as separate subjects (holson & pearce, 1992).
animals were housed in a climate-controlled environment with 12 h

of light and 12 h of dark with food and water available ad libitum. for
all behavioural tests, a total of eight or nine rats, male or female, were
assigned to each drug condition. for all neurochemical assays, to
assure that enough tissue would be utilized for each assay, a subset of
subjects from each drug condition were analysed. regardless, at least
ﬁve subjects were analysed per condition, and only one male or female
subject from each litter was assigned to each condition. all procedures
within this study were approved by the university committee on
animal care at east tennessee state university and were in
accordence with the national institutes of health guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals.

apparatus
the mwm consisted of a galvanized tub 145 cm in diameter and
58.4 cm in height. the inside of the pool was painted black and ﬁlled
with water to a height of  40 cm with a temperature range of 19–21 c.
a platform was composed of plastic pvc pipe with a round plastic top
that had a diameter of 12.7 cm and was painted black. the water in the
mwm was rendered opaque by dissolving black nontoxic tempera paint
in the water to obscure the platform location. the pool was divided
arbitrarily into quadrants using cardinal compass points and it was
surrounded by several extramaze cues including posters hung on the
surrounding walls, a video monitor, two waste baskets, and the
experimenter sitting at the south point of the tub always dressed in a
beige lab coat. the overhead lights were turned off and four spotlights
illuminated the room. this dimly lit environment provided spatial
contrast in light as well as allowing for the video tracking system
(videomex-v; columbus instruments, columbus, oh, usa) to track
the animal’s movements during behavioural testing in the mwm.

drug administration and rationale for dosages
animals were neonatally injected i.p. with the d2 ⁄ d3 agonist
quinpirole hcl (1 mg ⁄ kg) or with saline (0.9%) once daily from p1
to p21. this dose and drug treatment regimen has been shown in
several studies to induce priming of the  xxxg656xxx  that persists
throughout the animal’s lifetime (kostrzewa et al., 1991, 1993, 1995,
2004) as well as produce cognitive deﬁcits in rats behaviourally tested
on the mwm (brown et al., 2002, 2004a, 2004b). for the yawning
test on p61 and p98, quinpirole hcl was administered at a dose of
100 lg ⁄ kg, based on past ﬁndings by nowak et al. (2001) that
demonstrated this dose produced a maximal yawning response
compared to lower doses of quinpirole. from p62 to p90, rats were
i.p. injected twice daily with olanzapine (2.5 mg ⁄ kg) or saline. thus,
all animals were given a total of 5 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ day of olanzapine. this
dose was chosen based on past data that demonstrated acute
administration of a lower dose of olanzapine (3.0 mg ⁄ kg) produces
a robust increase in hippocampal acetylcholine release (shirazisouthall et al., 2002), and chronic treatment with 3.0 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ day
olanzapine has been shown to be sufﬁcient to produce signiﬁcant
increases in ngf protein in several different brain areas (angelucci
et al., 2005). additionally, the dose of 5 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ day of olanzapine
has been shown to result in plasma levels that are within the range of
plasma levels at therapeutic doses for the treatment of schizophrenia
(andersson et al., 2002). clinically, doses of olanzapine of
5 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ day have been shown to improve cognitive function in
schizophrenics (rosenheck et al., 2003; stip & mancini-marie, 2004;
stratta et al., 2005). rats were injected once in the morning between
08.00 and 09.00 h and once in the afternoon between 13.00 and
14.00 h.

olanzapine alleviation of d2 priming and cognition 2077
yawning behaviour
yawning behaviour was tested in response to an acute quinpirole
injection twice in this study, once at p61 before olanzapine treatment
began and again at p98 after chronic olanzapine treatment and
behavioural testing were complete. for this test, all animals, regardless
of neonatal treatment condition, were i.p. injected with quinpirole
(100 lg ⁄ kg). immediately after the injection, each rat was individually placed into plastic polycarbonate cages that were without bedding.
the cage was inverted during behavioural testing and slightly elevated
above a table, so that the plastic polycarbonate cage served as the top
and sides of the cage, and animal droppings would go through the
cage top. the rationale for this method is that animals tend to chew on
the bedding or droppings when injected with quinpirole, and we have
observed that chewing can supersede yawning.

morris water maze, place version
animals began training on the mwm the day after the last olanzapine
injection (p91). each animal was given two trial blocks of four trials
each day. all animals were tested at approximately the same time for
three consecutive days, yielding a total of 24 training trials. on each
trial, animals were released once from each of four release points
(north, south, east or west) and allowed 60 s to reach the platform. if
the animal did not reach the platform, the experimenter manually
placed the rat on the platform at the end of each training trial for 10 s.
acquisition latency, deﬁned as the amount of time from when the rat
was released into the pool until the time it reached the platform, was
recorded on each training trial.
immediately after the last training trial on the ﬁnal day of training,
animals were given a probe trial in which the platform was removed
from the pool. animals were released from the north release point and
allowed to swim for 60 s. swim patterns were recorded via a ccd
video camera (rockhouse products, nj, usa) which was mounted
above the pool. the probe trial was analysed using a videomex
scanning system (columbus instruments, columbus, oh, usa) and
two dependent measures were utilized, the mean search difference
(msd) and mean zone difference (mzd) scores, which have been
described elsewhere (brown et al., 2000; gonzalez et al., 2000). for
the msd score, the length of time the animal spent in the quadrant
formerly containing the platform (quadrant d) was separately subtracted from the time spent in each of the other three quadrants that did
not contain the platform (quadrants a, b and c). for the mzd score,
the number of visits to the precise former platform location (zone d)
was separately subtracted from three other zones of equal size in the
other three quadrants (zones a, b and c). both the msd and mzd
scores were calculated using the following formula:
½ðd  aþ þ ðd  bþ þ ðd  cþ=3
swim speed was also measured on the probe trial.

morris water maze, match-to-place version
one day after mwm place version testing was complete, animals
began training on the match-to-place version. animals were given two
daily trials for four consecutive days, yielding a total of eight training
trials on this version of the task. each day, the platform was placed in a
different quadrant of the pool and animals were released from a point
always located across the pool from the platform. following the
procedure for the place version, animals were allowed 60 s to reach
the platform and if the animal did not reach the platform it was

manually placed there by the experimenter, where it remained for
 10 s. immediately after their ﬁrst daily trial, animals were released
from the identical release point for the second daily trial and again
allowed 60 s to locate the platform. acquisition latency served as the
only dependent measure for this version of the mwm.

estrous cycle verification
on the day of the probe trial of the mwm place version, the stage of
the estrous cycle was veriﬁed in female rats. the estrous cycle stage
was veriﬁed utilizing a damp cotton swab that was inserted into the
vagina and smeared onto a clean microscope slide. the rationale for
veriﬁcation at this point in behavioural testing was based on past
evidence that has shown ﬂuctuations in both the anatomy and
physiology of the hippocampus at different stages of the estrous cycle
(woolley et al., 1990; warren & juraska, 1997; gonzalez-burgos
et al., 2005). the slides were analysed utilizing an olympus light
microscope with 20· magniﬁcation and determined by comparing the
vaginal smear to reference photographs of cell appearance during
different stages of the estrous cycle (marcondes et al., 2002).

tissue analysis
brain tissue was taken the day after the match-to-place version at p99.
once tissue was harvested, whole hippocampus, medial frontal cortex
and medial cerebellar cortex were dissected away from the rest of the
brain, rapidly frozen by submergence in cold isopentane ()20 c) and
subsequently stored at )80 c until assayed.

 xxxg1614xxx  assays
for the ngf and bdnf assay, the bdnf or ngf emax immunoassay protocol was followed as deﬁned by the supplier (promega,
madison, wi, usa). in brief, 10 ll of the anti-bdnf monoclonal
antibody (mab) was added to 9.99 ml of carbonate coating buffer
(ph 9.7), and 100 ll of this mixture added to each well of a
polystyrene elisa plate (nunc, maxisorb) and incubated overnight
at 4 c. all wells were washed using a tbst wash buffer and
incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and nonspeciﬁc binding was
blocked through adding a block and sample 1 · buffer and deionized
water mixture to each well and incubating at room temperature for 1 h.
the bdnf standard curve was prepared using the bdnf standard
supplied from the manufacturer (1 lg ⁄ ml). the standard was diluted
1 : 2000 in block · sample 1 · buffer to achieve a concentration of
500 pg ⁄ ml. six 1 : 2 serial dilutions were prepared and incubated
with shaking at room temperature for 2 h. antihuman bdnf
polyclonal antibody (pab) was then added to each well plate and
incubated at room temperature (2 h); this was followed by incubation
(1 h) with anti-igy horseradish peroxidase conjugate. finally, 100 ll
of tetramethyl benzidine (tmb) one solution was added to each well;
this was followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature. the
entire reaction was stopped in each well with the addition of 100 ll of
1 n hydrochloric acid and read within 30 min.
a very similar protocol for ngf analysis was followed, and the
promega kit (madison, wi, usa) was utilized. for ngf analysis, ﬂatbottomed 96-well plates were coated with anti-ngf pab which binds
soluble ngf. the captured ngf was bound by a second speciﬁc
mab. after washing, the amount of speciﬁcally bound mab was then
detected using a species-speciﬁc antibody conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase as a tertiary reactant. the unbound conjugate was removed
by washing and, following an incubation with a chromogenic

substrate, the colour change was measured. for both bdnf and ngf,
the content was expressed as pg of  xxxg1614xxx  per mg weight
of brain tissue.

chat assay protocol
brain tissue was homogenized in a ripa cell lysis buffer with protease
inhibitors added. samples were weighed before adding buffer, and
tissue was homogenized with 300 ll of buffer per sample for
hippocampus, 200 ll of buffer for frontal cortex and 600 ll of buffer
for cerebellum. after homogenization, samples were stored on ice for
1 h and then were placed in a centrifuge at 14 000 g for 1 h at 4 c,
and the supernatant was then transferred to labelled tubes and stored at
)80 c. for the elisa, samples were placed onto a 96-well
maxisorp plate (nunc), with 50 ll phosphate-buffered saline added
per well and incubated overnight at 2–4 c. after rinsing with
phosphate-buffered saline tween-20, all wells were blocked with 5%
milk solution and the primary pab rabbit anti-chat (chemicon,
temecula, ca, usa) was applied in a 1 : 500 dilution in 1% milk
solution. the next day, the plate was again rinsed and the secondary
antibody, goat antirabbit-conjugated horseradish peroxidase at a
dilution of 1 : 10 000 in a 5% milk solution, was applied. the
substrate, tmb, was added at 50 ll per well; well contents were read
by a plate reader (bio-rad) at 450 nm absorbance. chat values were
expressed in pg ⁄ mg of tissue relative to a standard curve utilizing rat
recombinant  xxxg440xxx  (chemicon) in a serial dilution.

research design
for all analyses, the factors in the design were neonatal drug
treatment (two levels: quinpirole, saline), adulthood drug treatment
(two levels: olanzapine, saline), and sex (two levels: male, female).
for the yawning behaviour measure at p61, a 2 · 2 two-way anova
was used, because adulthood drug treatment had not yet been
administered at p61. at p98, a 2 · 2 · 2 three-way anova was
utilized with adulthood drug treatment included. for the acquisition
latency measure on the place version of the mwm, we utilized a
2 · 2 · 2 · 6 (repeated measure: trial block, six levels) four-way
anova. for the msd and msd score measurements on the probe
trial, the match-to-place version of the mwm and all neurochemical
analyses, a 2 · 2 · 2 three-way anova was utilized. finally, estrous
cycle was recorded on the day of the mwm place version probe trial
because past studies had shown that stage of the estrous cycle
inﬂuences mwm performance (warren & juraska, 1997). stage of
the estrous cycle served as a separate independent variable (between
subjects: diestrous, proestrous and estrous stage) with either neonatal
drug treatment or adulthood drug treatment used as the other
independent variable. this was performed in two separate two-way
anovas to analyse the inﬂuence of the estrous cycle on the msd
and mzd probe trial measurements. the reason that estrous cycle
was not included with both neonatal and adulthood drug treatment
together in one analysis was due to the complexity of statistical
analysis as well as low numbers of subjects in particular conditions
producing insufﬁcient statistical power. for example, there tended to
be fewer females in estrous (12 h of the 4-day estrous cycle) vs.
other stages of the estrous cycle, such as proestrous (36 h of the
4-day estrous cycle). in addition to the above analyses, a pearson’s
product–moment correlation coefﬁcient was utilized to analyse
correlations between each neurochemical assay and the mzd,
msd and trial difference on the match-to-place version of the water
maze for each treatment group.

results
yawning behaviour, p61 and p98.
the number of yawns per hour is expressed as a function of drug
condition in fig. 1a. a two-way anova revealed a signiﬁcant main
effect of sex, f1,64 ¼ 26.19 p < 0.0001, and neonatal drug treatment,
f1,64 ¼ 5.51, p < 0.02. post hoc analyses revealed that male rats
yawned signiﬁcantly more often than females. male animals administered neonatal quinpirole treatment yawned more often than male
rats neonatally administered saline, and female rats neonatally
administered quinpirole yawned signiﬁcantly more often than females
neonatally administered saline, demonstrating that the dopamine d2
receptor was primed in both male and female rats.
yawning behaviour at p98 is presented as a function of drug
treatment in fig. 1b. a four-way anova was conducted and revealed
signiﬁcant main effects of sex, f1,68 ¼ 4.47, p < 0.03, neonatal drug
treatment f1,68 ¼ 3.73, p < 0.05, and a neonatal drug treatment · adulthood drug treatment interaction, f1,68 ¼ 4.23, p < 0.04. post hoc
analysis revealed that male rats demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase in
yawning as compared to female rats. female rats neonatally treated
with quinpirole and saline in adulthood (female group q-s) displayed
a signiﬁcant increase in yawns compared to all other female groups,
and there were no signiﬁcant differences between any of the other
female groups. likewise, male rats neonatally treated with quinpirole
and saline in adulthood (male group q-s) displayed a signiﬁcant
increase compared to controls, and there were no other signiﬁcant
differences between any of the other male groups. it appears from
these results that olanzapine, possibly combined with training on the
mwm, alleviated the signiﬁcant increase in yawning produced by
neonatal quinpirole treatment in both males and females.

main effects or interactions were signiﬁcant. overall, results showed
that males demonstrated a signiﬁcantly greater difference between

discussion
the results of this study demonstrated several important ﬁndings. rats
neonatally treated with quinpirole demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase
in yawning in adulthood that was alleviated by olanzapine treatment,
indicating that olanzapine normalized the effects of neonatal quinpirole treatment on a  xxxg656xxx -mediated behaviour. interestingly,
adulthood olanzapine treatment alleviated cognitive deﬁcits produced
by neonatal quinpirole treatment on the place version of the mwm.
however, neonatal quinpirole treatment did not produce signiﬁcant
deﬁcits on the match-to-place version of the mwm. adulthood
olanzapine treatment alleviated decreased levels of ngf, bdnf and
chat in the hippocampus of animals treated with neonatal quinpirole
but did not alleviate signiﬁcant decreases in bdnf and chat in the

frontal cortex, nor did it alter levels of either bdnf, ngf or chat in
the cerebellum. these results demonstrate that the effects of olanzapine on neurotrophins and acetylcholine appear to be speciﬁc to the
hippocampus.
an especially impressive ﬁnding in the current study is that
olanzapine alleviated the increase in yawning of animals neonatally
treated with quinpirole, and this effect was demonstrated after an
8-day washout of olanzapine. the fact that olanzapine alleviated
cognitive deﬁcits as well as d2 priming might suggest that increases in
d2 sensitivity are responsible for cognitive deﬁcits observed on the
place version of the mwm. increases in  xxxg656xxx 
activation have been shown to produce cognitive impairment in spatial
memory tasks (bushnell & levin, 1993; kim & levin, 1996),
although other studies have shown that activation of the  xxxg656xxx 
may enhance spatial memory (packard & mcgaugh, 1994; wilkerson
& levin, 1999). in general, neonatal treatment with drugs that activate
the dopaminergic system have resulted in cognitive impairment,
probably due to their effects on developing brain systems underlying
cognitive performance (for review, see walker et al., 1999). we
hypothesize that neonatal quinpirole treatment is probably producing
disruption of hippcampal and frontal cortex development, based on
ﬁndings that have shown this treatment results in decreases in ngf,
bdnf and ⁄ or chat in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of both
young and adult d2-primed animals (brown et al., 2004a, 2004b).
past studies have shown that olanzapine results in cognitive deﬁcits
when administered to control rats either immediately before or
chronically before behavioural testing on the mwm (skarsfeldt, 1996;
terry et al., 2002). the present study also demonstrated that chronic
olanzapine administered before behavioural testing on the mwm
place version resulted in cognitive impairment, which was apparent in
females in acquisition and in both males and females on the probe
trial. it has been previously hypothesized that, during acquisition of
the place version of the mwm, rats learn a search strategy or search
strategies to locate the platform, whereas the probe trial is measure of
the integration of several different search strategies to correctly
pinpoint the platform location (whishaw et al., 1995). it appears from
these data that females demonstrate a more robust cognitive impairment on both strategy acquisition and the use of this strategy on the
probe trial. importantly, the present study is the only report of the
effects of olanzapine on mwm performance in both male and female
rats.
cognitive impairment produced by neonatal quinpirole treatment
appears to be more speciﬁc to tasks in which information remains
stable over trials, such as that which occurs in the place version of the
mwm. results showed no drug-induced impairment on the match-toplace version of the mwm which, it has been hypothesized, tests
working memory (morris et al., 1986; brandeis et al., 1989).
although the hippocampus has been shown to be important for both
reference and working memory, it appears that neonatal quinpirole
treatment primarily affects reference but not working memory, at least
in d2-primed adults. we have recently demonstrated match-to-place
deﬁcits in d2-primed animals tested as early postweanlings from p22
to  xxxg994xxx  (brown et al., 2005). thus, the deﬁcits at the earlier age of
testing on the match-to-place version of the mwm may be due to
withdrawal from drug treatment rather than persistent changes in
hippocampal connectivity.
the present study demonstrated that olanzapine alleviated signiﬁcant decreases in hippocampal ngf, bdnf and chat in d2-primed
rats. the exact mechanism through which olanzapine is working to
produce these neurochemical changes is not known. all of these
proteins have been shown to be important in cognitive performance
(sinson et al., 1995; van der zee et al., 1995; schaaf et al., 2001;

european journal of neuroscience, 24, 2075–2083

2082 s. k. thacker et al.
pepeu & giovannini, 2004). both ngf trka and bdnf trkb
receptors are located on septohippocampal cholinergic neurons (rylett
et al., 1993), and olanzapine may be increasing acetylcholinergic
activity through its effects on neurotrophins within this pathway
(parikh et al., 2004c). past studies have shown complex effects of
olanzapine and its effects on neurotrophins. chronic olanzapine has
been shown to result in augmention of ngf but a reduction in bdnf
(angelucci et al., 2005) but has also been shown to result in no
changes in bdnf after olanzapine treatment in nontreated control rats,
although olanzapine was able to restore signiﬁcant decreases in bdnf
produced by the typical antipsychotic haloperidol (parikh et al.,
2004b). the inconsistency of the effects of olanzapine on controls
between this and past studies is probably due to methodological and
research design differences. the contradiction between the present
and past results points out that issues of dose, route of administration
and days of washout after drug administration may be critical when
analysing the effects of olanzapine on these neurochemical markers.
in the present study, we reported signiﬁcant correlations for
hippocampal ngf and the msd score of the mwm place version
in groups q-o and s-o, and signiﬁcant correlations for hippocampal
chat and mwm msd and mzd scores in groups s-s, q-o and q-s,
and two signiﬁcant negative correlations between frontal cortex chat
and groups q-o and s-s. we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant correlations
with bdnf and mwm performance. what this may indicate is that
the ngf and chat levels in the hippocampus and, to a lesser extent,
the frontal cortex correlate with mwm performance a bit better than
bdnf, and indicate that deﬁcits in spatial memory may be a direct
consequence of alterations in  xxxg259xxx  and chat content utilizing
certain dependent measures. however, it is important to note that there
are relatively low numbers of subjects in these conditions, and an
increased number may be required to observe signiﬁcant correlations
with bdnf in other drug conditions.
the ﬁnding that neonatal quinpirole treatment produced signiﬁcant
decreases in ngf, bdnf and chat in the adult hippocampus
replicates previous work (brown et al., 2004a, 2004b). studies have
shown that the  xxxg656xxx  is important in regulation of acetylcholine
release in the hippocampus although its precise role is yet to be
identiﬁed (imperato et al., 1993; day & fibiger, 1994; umegaki et al.,
2001). the primarily acetylcholinergic septohippocampal pathway has
been shown to play an important role in cognition, and it appears that
neonatal quinpirole treatment may be producing signiﬁcant  xxxg1614xxx  and enzymatic changes along this pathway that may
result in cognitive impairment on the mwm.
additionally, this study replicated previous effects from this
laboratory showing that priming of the  xxxg656xxx  results
in cognitive deﬁcits (brown et al., 2002) and produces signiﬁcant
decreases in ngf and bdnf (brown et al., 2004a,b). these results
help to also validate this as a rodent model of schizophrenia, as
schizophrenics have been shown to demonstrate cognitive impairment
(see elvevag & goldberg, 2000, for review) as well as decreases in
these same neurotrophic factors in the brain and bloodstream (durany
et al., 2001; toyooka et al., 2002).
in conclusion, adulthood olanzapine treatment was found in the
present study to alleviate behavioural and neurochemical abnormalities in a rodent model of  xxxg656xxx  priming. however,
also important is that adulthood olanzapine treatment produced a
signiﬁcant impairment in mwt performance in control animals,
suggesting an important role of the d2 and 5-h2a receptor in this task.
although olanzapine did not alleviate all changes produced by
neonatal quinpirole treatment, it is apparent that olanzapine may have
therapeutic potential when particular brain systems underlying cognition may be compromised.
