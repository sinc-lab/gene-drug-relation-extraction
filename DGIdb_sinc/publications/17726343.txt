abstract
background/aims: phosphodiesterase type 4 (pde4) has
been previously shown to regulate colonic contractile activity in vitro. in this study, the effects of pde4 inhibition were
assessed in a model of stress-induced defecation previously
demonstrated to be due to increased colonic transit/evacuation. methods: rats were individually placed in a mild restraint cage and placed into a 12 ° c environment (cold-restraint stress) for 60 min. mice received restraint (only) stress
at room temperature for 30 min. loperamide (positive control compound) or two different pde4 inhibitors ( xxxd3142xxx 
and  xxxd3140xxx ) were administered orally at several doses to
the rodents 1 h before stress began. vehicle alone was administered for comparison. the number of fecal pellets expelled during stress (fecal pellet output), total fecal pellet
wet weight and total fecal water content were measured.
results: loperamide produced a dose-related decrease
(id50s in mg/kg) in fecal pellet output (rat = 7.4, mouse = 0.7)
and significantly decreased fecal wet weight (72.9%) and de-

creased fecal percent water content (9.4%). the two pde4
inhibitors produced a similar dose-related inhibition of fecal
pellet output.  xxxd3142xxx  exhibited id50s in rat and mouse of
14.1 and 27.1, respectively.  xxxd3142xxx  significantly decreased
fecal wet weight (58.8%) but increased fecal percent water
content (15.0%). for  xxxd3140xxx , id50s were 24.2 mg/kg and
12.4 in the rat and mouse, respectively. although  xxxd3140xxx 
also significantly (p ! 0.05) decreased fecal wet weight
(47.2%), it did not significantly increase fecal percent water
content. conclusions: these data indicate that pde4 inhibition is effective in reducing rodent stress-induced defecation, provides the first functional data on a potential role for
pde4 activity in the colonic evacuation response to stress,
and indicates the potential utility of pde4 inhibitors in functional bowel disease such as irritable bowel syndrome requires further evaluation.

introduction

phosphodiesterases are a diverse family of enzymes
that hydrolyze cyclic nucleotides and regulate cell functions via the intracellular levels of the second messenger’s
cyclic adenosine 3,5-monophosphate (camp) and cyclic
guanosine 3,5-monophosphate (cgmp). there are a
number of different phosphodiesterase isozymes that

materials and methods
experimental animals
male sprague-dawley rats (250–310 g in weight; charles river
labs) and c57bl/6 mice (18–24 g in weight; charles river labs)
were allowed free access to food and water and were housed in a
temperature- and light-controlled environment (12 h on/12 h off).
all experiments were conducted in accordance with nih regulations of animal care [14] and were approved by the glaxosmithkline institutional animal care and use committee.
experimental procedures
drugs
the compounds used, corresponding dose ranges and vehicles include: loperamide hydrochloride; [4-(chlorophrnyl)-4-hydroxy-n,n -dimethyl-  , -diphenyl-1-piperidine-butylramide
hydrochloride] (0.3–20 mg/kg; 25% ethanol, 25% peg-400, 50%
water),  xxxd3142xxx ; [4-[3-(cyclopentyloxy)-4-methoxyphenyl]2-pyrrolidinone] (1–30 mg/kg; peg-400), and  xxxd3140xxx ; [3-cyclopropylmethoxy- n -(3,5-dichloropyridin-4-yl)-4-(dif luoromethoxy)benzamide] (3–30 mg/kg; 1%  xxxd2609xxx ). appropriate
vehicles were used as controls for each compound studied. all compounds/vehicles were orally administered (2.5 ml/kg) 60 min prior
to stress. pde inhibitor compounds,  xxxd3142xxx  and  xxxd3140xxx ,
were synthesized at glaxosmithkline laboratories. loperamide
was purchased from sigma. different ranges and number of animals per groups were utilized for testing each of the different compounds, as building of compound dose-response curves for the observed effects required the addition of animals at previously tested
doses/vehicle with the addition of new animal dose groups in order
to accurately capture id50s for each compound tested.
rat cold-restraint stress-induced defecation and diarrhea
as previously reported [13], rats were placed in wire-mesh restraining cylinders (5.5 cm diameter ! 18.5 cm length providing
moderate restraint) and placed in a cold environment (i.e., refrigerator with door slightly ajar for ventilation; internal temperature
of 12 ° c) for 60 min. the number of fecal pellets expelled by each
animal, wet fecal weight, was measured using an analytical balance at 20-, 40-, and 60-min intervals. in about one-half of these
rats, fecal pellet dry weight (desiccated at 37 ° c for 24 h) was also
measured. in these rats, percent fecal water content was calculated by the formula: dry weight (g)/wet weight (g) ! 100%, also
as described previously [13]. all raw data were normalized for
each animal as the percent of the mean of the vehicle group for
that compound.
mouse-restraint stress-induced defecation
c57bl/6 mice were placed in wire-mesh restraining cylinders
(3 cm diameter ! 6 cm length providing moderate restraint) and
subjected to restraint at room temperature (23 ° c) for 30 min. the
number of pellets expelled by each animal was measured at 10min intervals. raw data were normalized for each animal as the
percent of the mean of the vehicle group for that compound.
statistical analyses
mean effective doses (i.e., id50; the concentration that inhibits
fecal output by 50% from dose-response data) and corresponding
95% confidence intervals were calculated using graphpad prism.
data were normally distributed and three or more treatment

were originally distinguished by their substrate specificity and sensitivity to calcium-calmodulin [1, 2]. today
there are 11 different isoenzyme groups identified, comprising over 50 isoforms [2–4]. phosphodiesterases have
become a major focus of drug discovery for a variety of
disease indications due to their diversity, molecular nature, and differential regulation, function and expression
in different cells and tissues [5]. in particular, phosphodiesterase type 4 (pde4) inhibitors have therapeutic utility for inflammatory diseases in the lung as well as for
psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases [6, 7].
cyclic nucleotides can mediate the extracellular to intracellular signaling involved in the motility of gut
smooth muscle and the secretion/absorption of the intestine [8–10]. clearly, cyclic nucleotides can regulate ion
transport and absorption/secretion [10] and gut relaxation or reduce contractility [11, 12]. the intracellular
concentration of these second messengers is determined
by a balance between their synthesis and metabolism. cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases are the sole enzymes
responsible for cyclic nucleotide degradation. in vitro
biochemical, pharmacological and muscle motility data
demonstrate the importance of pde4 in colonic motility.
specifically, colonic smooth muscle contains types 1, 2, 3,
4, and 5 phosphodiesterases. however, the role of these
isozymes determined using appropriate selective inhibitors indicated that, at least functionally, pde4 appears to
be very important in reducing contractile activity [12].
no in vivo data on the role of pde4 regulation of gut motility/function have since become available.
in the present study, increased fecal pellet output is produced by cold-restraint stress (i.e., that which can also increase the occurrence of gastric erosions) was utilized to
evaluate the effects of pde4 inhibitors on colonic function.
cold-restraint stress increases fecal pellet production and
fluid content in rats, effects that have been demonstrated
to be primarily due to increased colonic transit/evacuation
[13]. in addition, a murine model of restraint (only) induced increased fecal pellet output was also used to evaluate the effects of pde4 inhibitors. two different pde4 inhibitors from different chemical classes were evaluated,
and included  xxxd3142xxx  (a first-generation inhibitor) and
 xxxd3140xxx  (a more potent and selective second-generation inhibitor). the results of these studies indicate that
both pde4 inhibitors significantly reduced the stress-induced fecal output in both species under these conditions,
and suggest the potential utility of pde4 inhibition in conditions of stress-associated increased defecation/altered
bowel function (e.g., in symptoms of functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (ibs)).

discussion

in the present study, rat cold-restraint stress increases
in fecal pellet output were similar to that described previously [13]. agents that affected colonic motility in a manner that decreases colonic transit previously were shown
to be most effective in reducing colonic evacuation in this
model [13]. also, the present study extended this stressinduced effect to mice. however, the combination of both
cold and restraint stress was observed to be extreme for
mice, and restraint stress at room temperature was adequate to significantly increase fecal pellets for compound
evaluation (model development data not shown). al14

though vehicles were quite different for each drug tested,
basal/vehicle/control fecal pellet output in rats and mice
were very similar for each drug tested (see legends to figures 1 and 2).
loperamide served as an appropriate positive control
for both species and decreased stress-induced colonic
transit/fecal pellet output as published previously (i.e.,
decreased stress-induced colonic transit/fecal pellet
output; [13]). in the present studies, loperamide was
more potent in mice than in rats, consistent with the
significant increased murine potency observed by others [15]. generally, loperamide acts at peripheral opioid
receptors [16] to decrease both small intestinal and colonic transit [17–20], but its effects in ibs diarrhea are
variable and primarily associated with reduced urgency
[17]. loperamide can also exhibit significant peripheral
analgesia [21, 22].
the effects of pde4 inhibition on camp that results
in decreased smooth muscle contractility [12], together
with camp-associated increases in bowel secretion [23,
24] can explain most of the present results on fecal pellet
output, fecal wet weight and fecal water content. in addition to the direct smooth muscle relaxation effects of
pde4 inhibitors [12], pde4 inhibition can also reduce
electric field stimulation-induced contraction of the intestine. for example, pde4, but not pde1,  xxxg1695xxx , or
pde5, inhibition produces a depression of neural transmission within the enteric nervous system, apparently by
releasing noradrenalin acting at 2-adrenoceptors on enteric neurons. as a result, inhibition of pde4 inhibits
nerve-mediated contractions [25]. additional data does
suggest that pde inhibition and the elevation of camp
facilitates the release of norepinephrine at 2-synapses on
submucosal neurons in the small bowel [26, 27].

effects of drugs on mouse-restraint stress-induced
increased fecal pellet output
several doses of each drug were compared to vehicle.
stress was provided in mice using a modified version of
the rat protocol [13]. since it was observed that brief handling resulted in increased fecal pellet output in unrestrained mice (data not shown) and cold restraint was
extremely stressful for mice, restraint (alone) stress at
room temperature was used for murine stress-induced
defecation. mouse-restraint studies were performed at
room temperature for 30 min. as observed with rats, loperamide produced a dose-dependent decrease in fecal
pellet output (n = 10–48 mice per treatment group; fig. 2;
table 1). loperamide was more potent in mice than in rats
(table 1). also consistent with the rat findings were the
effects of pde4 inhibitors. both  xxxd3142xxx  (n = 10–25 mice
per treatment group) and  xxxd3140xxx  (n = 10 mice per
treatment group) produced similar dose-dependent decreases in fecal pellet output (fig. 2; table 1). percent fecal
water content was not determined in mice studies.

tors, however, decrease fecal pellet output and fecal wet
weight, but increased fecal water apparently by increasing
camp which can act to decrease motility/transit and increase secretion. an agent that deceases gut transit by
relaxing smooth muscle/interfering with propulsive gut
nervous contractions but with minimal gut secretory activity, like  xxxd3140xxx , may be most ideal for ibs treatment. considering that the majority of ibs sufferers alternate between diarrhea and constipation [44], the therapeutic impact of pde4 inhibition provides for its use
during either alternating diarrhea or constipation symptoms, while loperamide can only be indicated for diarrhea type of ibs [45]. also, loperamide can be contraindicated due to its effects to decrease secretion during constipation symptoms and due to its actions to increase gut
contractions in individuals with heightened sensitivity to
visceral/gut pain [43, 46, 47].
in summary, these data indicate the importance of
pde4 in rodent colonic function. the specific local versus
peripheral versus central effects of pde4 inhibition on reducing colonic evacuation and increasing fecal water can
certainly be studied further. also, more phenomena
should be evaluated under these conditions in the future,
such as changes in colonic pressure and visceral sensitivity. finally, only the acute effects of pde4 inhibition have
been determined in these studies, a factor limited by the
nature of the acute stress in the models utilized. in any
event, the effects of pde4 inhibition on reducing stressinduced colonic evacuation have clearly been demonstrated for the first time in the present studies. [48]. previous
studies in this model have demonstrated that the increased
stress-induced defecation is associated with increased colonic transit/evacuation [13], and available literature has
demonstrated pde inhibition can act to decrease colonic
motility and increase intestinal secretion. previous studies [13] also have demonstrated that several antidepressants do not affect increased fecal output in this model
(i.e., suggesting that pde4 antidepressant actions might
not be responsible for the present efficacy). the anti-inflammatory effect of pde4 inhibition using  xxxd3142xxx  produced efficacy in experimental colitis and was superior to
methylprednisolone in preventing late collagen deposition and pde4 inhibitors are being developed as anti-inflammatory agents for use in treating several diseases [2,
6, 7, 34, 35, 42]. the recent hypothesis that ibs also involves aspects of immune activation and inflammation
[49, 50] suggests that pde4 inhibitors be explored further
to target the irritable bowel at several levels, including altered motility, transit, secretion, and perhaps inflammation.

pde4 inhibitors produced an increase in fecal percent
water content of well-formed but soft stools/pellets in the
present study. specifically, inhibition with  xxxd3142xxx  significantly increased fecal percent water content. apparently, the pde4 inhibition-induced elevation of camp
results in increased chloride ion secretion, as demonstrated in intact mucosa and isolated colonic crypt cells
[28]. loperamide, however, decreased fecal water in the
present study, and has been shown to abolish the intestinal fluid secretion [29, 30] and secretory diarrhea [31] induced by pge2 in other studies. this loperamide antisecretory effect, together with its effects to reduce gut transit via its effects to increase segmentation and reduce gut
propulsion [18–20], contributes to the antidiarrhea effect
of this opiate analogue and differentiates it from pde4
inhibitory effects/efficacy under these conditions.
the differential effects of  xxxd3142xxx  versus  xxxd3140xxx 
on different pde4 isozymes [32], differential potency/activity of  xxxd3142xxx  vs.  xxxd3140xxx  in vivo [33, 34], pharmacokinetics and brain penetration [35–37] and/or the
pharmacological/cns effects of  xxxd3142xxx  [38–41] may
explain the difference in increased fecal percent water
content for  xxxd3142xxx  1  xxxd3140xxx . clearly,  xxxd3142xxx  and
 xxxd3140xxx  have different affinities for the  xxxd3142xxx  highaffinity and low-affinity binding sites and different affinities for each of the  xxxg1697xxx /b family isozymes [4, 42].
the differential ratios of efficacies for fecal pellet output
to percent water content between the pde4 inhibitors are
a key consideration. for example, the fecal pellet output
ratio of  xxxd3142xxx  to  xxxd3140xxx  is close to one (i.e., for
 xxxd3142xxx  the id50 for fecal pellets and fecal wet weight is
not significantly different with similar significant effects
 xxxd1891xxx  and 30 mg/kg for both drugs). however, the percent
fecal water content ratio of  xxxd3142xxx  to  xxxd3140xxx  is 110fold (i.e., a significantly increased fecal water content is
observed for all doses of  xxxd3142xxx  without significant effects at any dose for  xxxd3140xxx ). taken as a whole, these
data suggest less positive intestinal secretory (and perhaps emetogenic, an identified negative side effect of  xxxd3142xxx ) effects for the second-generation pde4 inhibitor,
 xxxd3140xxx . these data also might imply a more selective
direct smooth muscle (i.e., anti-transit) effect versus an
adrenergic/other indirect effect (i.e., to increase intestinal
water secretion) for  xxxd3140xxx . no adverse effects of
pde4 inhibition were observed in any animals during
these tests.
ibs is characterized by enhanced gut responsiveness
to stress [43], similar to the model used in the present
studies. in the present study, loperamide decreased fecal
pellet output, weight and water content. the pde inhibi-
