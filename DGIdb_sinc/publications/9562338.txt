key words:  xxxd1703xxx  – 5-hydroxytryptamine – gastric
ulceration – neutrophils – oxygen free radicals

abstract. objective and design: the aim of the present
study was to examine the effects of  xxxd1703xxx , a novel
prokinetic benzamide-stimulating gastrointestinal motility
agent, on gastric secretion and ulceration in rats and elucidate
some possible vascular and anti-oxidant mechanisms of such
protection.
material: male wistar rats.
treatment:  xxxd1703xxx  (cnt, lab. almirall, s.a.) (0.25, 0.5,
and 1 mg/kg) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht, sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa) (10 mg/kg), administered
intraperitoneally (i.p.).
methods: gastric ulceration was induced by instillation of
1 ml/100 g animal of 50% (v/v) ethanol in distilled water and
by pylorus-ligated rat model. gastric microvascular changes,
and the activity of myeloperoxidase (as a marker of neutrophil
infiltration) and glutathione peroxidase (an important enzyme
in scavenging of lipid peroxides) were determined. the results
were compared with those of 5-ht. the data were evaluated
using student’s t-test for paired data and the non-parametric
mann-whitney u-test.
results: in 4 h pyloric-ligated animals, i.p. cnt did not
significantly reduce the incidence of gastric mucosal damage,
and no significant differences were found in the values of total
volume and acidity. however, cnt caused a marked and
dose-dependent reduction of haemorrhagic lesions induced by
50% v/v ethanol. these protective effects were specifically
related to a reduction of neutrophil infiltration. cnt at the
dose of 1 mg/kg raised the decreased glutathione peroxidase
activity to the control level. in contrast, pretreatment with 5-ht
worsened the  xxxd102xxx induced erosions, but did not significantly induce any gastric microvascular changes. however, the
myeloperoxidase activity rose markedly and the glutathione
peroxidase levels decreased significantly in the mucosa injured
by 50% v/v ethanol.
conclusions: this study demonstrates a new gastroprotective
feature of cnt that could be partly explained not only through
reduction of neutrophil toxicity but also by an increased
synthesis of free-radical scavenging enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase. furthermore, it is likely that serotonergicdependent mechanisms are also involved via 5-ht2 -receptor
blockade and 5-ht1 receptor activation.

introduction
it has been estimated that 90% of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) present in the adult human body is located in
the gastrointestinal tract. almost all of this is contained in
epithelial enteroendocrine cells. the rest exists in enteric
neurons and mucosal mast cells [1]. physiological studies
suggest that 5-ht of neuronal origin plays a vital role in
controlling gastrointestinal motor function. this amine has
been shown to have other biological activities such as
gastric secretion inhibition and mucosal ulcerogenicity
[2–3].
substituted benzamides have been shown to clear acid
from the lower oesophagus, accelerate gastric emptying, and
speed transit through the small intestine and the colon.
although several of these agents have some 5-ht3 antagonistic activity, the possession of  xxxg1117xxx -agonist activity
seems to be the most important characteristic for prokinetic
activity [4]. it has been reported that a reduced clearing
capacity of the stomach seems to be important in the
pathogenesis of gastric ulcer. thus, prokinetic drugs might
enhance the clearance of acidic gastric effluent from the
bulb, and thereby reduce the duration of its contact with the
mucosa [5].
previous studies have shown that  xxxd1708xxx , a potent
prokinetic benzamide, is effective in healing gastric ulcers
and might prevent duodenal ulcer relapse after healing [5–
7]. by the same token,  xxxd1708xxx  has also been shown
effective in reducing the incidence of experimental gastric
mucosal injury induced by oral administration of ethanol in
pylorus-ligated rats [8–10]. moreover, the literature shows
that there is now strong evidence that cure of helicobacter
pylori infection is a valid surrogate and can be used as the
primary end-point for reduced duodenal ulcer and gastric
ulcer recurrence in patients with active ulcers [11–12].
 xxxd1703xxx  (cnt) is a novel prokinetic benzamide
derivative which stimulates  xxxg1117xxx  and 5-ht1 and blocks
the  xxxg1113xxx  [13]. experimentally, cnt was effective

in patients with disordered motor patterns associated with
delayed gastrointestinal transit, such as non-ulcer dyspepsia
[14] and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease [15]. in a previous
report, cnt showed significant gastroprotective effects on
mucosal injury produced by 50% v/v ethanol. these effects
could be partly explained through prostaglandin-dependent
mechanisms [16].
experimental evidence indicates that stasis of blood flow
and increased vascular permeability reflect early pathogenic
factors in the development of  xxxd102xxx induced gastric
haemorrhagic erosions [17]. lipid peroxidation and active
oxygen metabolites have also been suggested as playing an
important role in the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal
injury induced by ethanol [18]
the aim of the present study was to examine the effects
of cnt on gastric secretion and ulceration in rats and
elucidate vascular and anti-oxidant mechanisms of such
protection. for this purpose, gastric microvascular changes,
and the activity of myeloperoxidase (as a marker of
neutrophil infiltration) and glutathione peroxidase (an
important enzyme in scavenging of lipid peroxides) were
determined. the results were compared with those of 5-ht.

stomach was removed, opened along the greater curvature, and placed in
a pre-weighed tube with formamide at 65 8c for 12 h. the dye content
extracted was quantified by light absorbance at 620 nm, and the tissue
content (mg eb/mg wet weight tissue) was calculated from a standard
curve.

enzymatic assays
myeloperoxidase. neutrophil infiltration in vivo has previously been
assessed by measuring granulocyte- specific enzymes, such as
myeloperoxidase (mpo), in tissue [20]. briefly, one sample from the
gastric corpus was excised from each animal and rapidly rinsed with
ice-cold saline, blotted dry, and frozen at ¹70 8c. the tissue was
thawed, weighed and homogenized in 10 volumes of 50 mm phosphatebuffered saline (pbs), ph ¼ 7.4. the homogenate was centrifuged at
20000 g, 20 min at 4 8c. the pellet was again homogenized in 10
volumes of 50 mm pbs, ph ¼ 6.0, containing 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (hetab) and 10 mm edta. this
homogenate was subjected to one cycle of freezing/thawing and a
brief period of sonication.
homogenate (0.5 ml) was added to a 0.5 ml reaction volume
containing 80 mm pbs, ph ¼ 5.4, 0.5% hetab and 1.6 mm 3,30 ,5,50 tetramethylbenzidine (tmb). the mixture was incubated at 37 8c for
5 min and the reaction started by the addition of 0.3 mm h2o2. each
tube containing the complete reaction mixture was incubated for exactly
3 min at 37 8c. the reaction was terminated by the sequential addition
of catalase (20 mg/ml) and 2 ml of 0.2 m na-acetate, ph ¼ 3.0. the
changes in absorbance at 655 nm were measured with a spectrophotometer. one unit of mpo activity was defined as the amount of
enzyme present that produced a change in absorbance of 1.0 unit/min at
37 8c in the final reaction volume containing the acetate.

materials and methods
animals
male wistar rats weighing 180–200 g were placed in single cages with
wire-net floors in a controlled room (temperature 22–24 8c, humidity 70–
75%) and were fed a normal laboratory diet. the animals were deprived of
food for 24 h before experimentation but allowed free access to tap water
throughout. all studies were carried out using 6–8 rats per group.

glutathione peroxidase. gsh-px activity was quantified by the method
of yoshikawa [21]. from scrapings of glandular stomach mucosa of
control and treated animals, the anti-oxidative enzyme was evaluated by
following the decrease in absorbance at 365 nm induced by 0.25 mm
h2o2 in the presence of  xxxd2213xxx  (10 mm), nadph (4 mm),
and 1u enzymatic activity of  xxxg981xxx  in pbs buffer,
ph 7.8. the absorbance changes were read between minutes 3 and 10.
results were expressed as nmol/min/mg protein. protein concentration
was calculated following bradford’s assay [22].

drug preparation and treatment
 xxxd1703xxx  (cnt, lab. almirall s.a.) (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg) and 5hydroxytryptamine (5-ht, sigma, st. louis, mo, usa) (10 mg/kg)
were dissolved in saline (0.9% nacl), prepared freshly each time and
administered intraperitoneally (i.p.).
different control groups received saline alone (sham) or saline plus
ethanol (control), also at different times and in a comparable volume
(0.2 ml/100 g, i.p.).

pylorus-ligated gastric secretion and ulceration
the pylorus-ligated rat model first described by shay et al. [23] was
used. the drugs were administered orally 1 h before starting the
experiment. the pylorus was tied under light ether anaesthesia. care
was taken not to damage the blood supply. animals were allowed to rest
for 4 h, and were then killed using an overdose of anaesthetic. the
cardia was ligated and the whole stomach was removed. the gastric
content was collected, and centrifuged to obtain a clear fluid. the total
volume was measured. samples were analyzed for hydrogen ion
concentration by potentiometric titration with 0.01 m naoh.
the stomach was cut open along the greater curvature and washed
gently under running tap water. any ulcers found were measured and
expressed as the ulcer index (u.i.) in accordance with the score of prino
et al. [24].

protection against 50% (v/v) ethanol
ulceration was induced as described by wong et al. [3] by instillation of
1 ml/100 g animal of 50% (v/v) ethanol in distilled water. the drugs
were injected i.p. in different doses (cnt 0.25, 0.50 and 1 mg/kg,
and 5-ht 10 mg/kg) to different groups of animals 30 min before the
oral administration of ethanol. one hour later, the animals were
sacrificed using an overdose of  xxxd2052xxx , and their stomachs were
removed and opened along the greater curvature. any lesions were
examined macroscopically. haemorrhagic lesions were measured
macroscopically. the ulcer index (u.i.) was expressed as % ulceration.

statistical analysis
values are given as means 6 sem. the data were evaluated using
student’s t-test for paired data and the non-parametric mann-whitney
u-test (u.i. determination).

determination of vascular permeability
the microvascular permeability (mvp) was evaluated after treatment
with different doses of cnt and 5-ht, measuring the extravasated
amount of evan’s blue dye (eb) in the mucosa according to the method
described by takeuchi et al. [17]. the rats were anaesthetized with
 xxxd3354xxx  (60 mg/kg), and 1 ml of 1% eb was injected
intravenously. thirty minutes later, each animal was killed, and the

of neutrophil infiltration) in control mucosal samples with
that in samples obtained after administration of cnt. our
data show, that according to gastric mucosal damage,
myeloperoxidase activity was significantly increased
(p < 0:05). these results indicate that there was a substantial
neutrophil influx into the mucosa in response to ethanol
injury in rats. at all doses tested, pretreatment with cnt
effectively attenuated the increase of myeloperoxidase
activity (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). in contrast, gsh-px activity in
the gastric mucosa decreased significantly (p < 0.05) following gastric injury, but pretreatment with cnt at doses of 0.5
and 1 mg/kg resulted in a significantly increased enzyme
activity, up to the sham group level (fig. 3).
pretreatment with 5-ht (10 mg/kg) 30 min before
ethanol administration worsened the  xxxd102xxx induced erosions. the percentage of ulceration reached a value of
301.06 6 15.37, but the amine did not significantly induce
any gastric microvascular changes (fig. 1).
in addition, 5-ht markedly raised the mpo activity
(161.59 6 16.37 u/mg wt (p < 0.01) compared with the nonulcerated control group (fig. 2), and induced a significant
decrease in gsh-px levels (p < 0.01) in the mucosa injured
by 50% v/v ethanol (fig. 3).

ligature. in this experimental model, treatment with 0.20,
0.5, and 1 mg/kg of cnt did not significantly reduce the
incidence of gastric mucosal damage compared with control
groups. furthermore, no significant differences were found
in the values of total volume and acidity.
intragastric administration of 50% v/v ethanol to control
rats produced large haemorrhagic and necrotic lesions in the
corpus mucosa along the long axis of the stomach. as shown
in figure 1, oral administration of cnt (0.25-1 mg/kg)
30 min before 50% v/v ethanol significantly reduced
haemorrhagic lesions compared with the ulcerated control
group. at the highest dose assayed (1 mg/kg), the percentage
of ulceration was decreased to 28.76 6 4.77% (p < 0:01).
under normal conditions with saline instillation alone,
the amount of dye (evan’s blue) trapped for 30 min in both
the gastric mucosa and contents was small, the total value
being 31.54 6 2.44 mg eb/g wt. the amount of dye increased
markedly in response to p.o. administration of 50% v/v
ethanol, with values reaching 92.21 6 8.01 mg eb/g wt
(p < 0:001); pretreatment of the animals with cnt did not
significantly inhibit this increased dye accumulation caused
by ethanol ( fig. 1).

discussion
the present study indicates that cnt (0.25, 0.50, and 1 mg/kg)
protects the rat gastric mucosa against  xxxd102xxx induced injury.
these protective effects were specifically related to a
reduction of neutrophil infiltration (mpo values). however,
cnt was not effective in reducing the incidence of gastric
mucosal damage in pylorus-ligated rats, and did not induce
significant changes in h+ or gastric volume.

enzyme that catalyses the formation of potent cytotoxic
oxidants such as hypochlorous acid and n-chloramines [27].
thus, it is possible that the inhibitory effects on neutrophil
function contribute significantly to the gastroprotection
afforded by cnt in this experimental model.
our results also reveal that cnt administration resulted
in a significant increase of gsh-px activity, up to the control
(normal rats) level. gsh-px is an important enzyme, which

anti-inflammatory drug administration [25–26], ischaemiareperfusion [27], and ethanol exposure [18].
ingested ethanol diffuses into the mucosa and causes the
liberation of inflammatory mediators from various resident
cells which subsequently activate circulating neutrophils.
activated granulocytes can injure tissue by generating oxy
radicals and releasing a variety of cytotoxic proteins,
including proteases, lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase, an

dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcers [33]. thus, it
can be assumed that increasing gastroprokinesis could also
contribute to the beneficial effects of cnt.
in conclusion, this study demonstrates a new gastroprotective feature of cnt that could be partly explained not
only through reduction of neutrophil toxicity but also by an
increased synthesis of free-radical scavenging enzymes such
as glutathione peroxidase. moreover, cnt seems to be a
very promising drug helping to heal gastric ulcers as a
facultative part of antiulcer treatment.

plays a role in the elimination of h2o2 and lipid hydroperoxides in the gastric mucosal cell. the anti-oxidant activity
of gsh-px is coupled with the oxidation of reduced
glutathione, which can subsequently be reduced by  xxxg981xxx , with nadph as the reducing agent.
thus, inhibition of this enzyme may result in h2o2
accumulation, with subsequent oxidation of lipids. hydrogen
peroxide is converted partially to the highly reactive hydroxyl
radical in a fenton-type reaction catalyzed by transition metal.
this suggests that cnt might protect rat gastric mucosa by its
ability to increase the synthesis of free-radical scavenging
enzymes in the mucosa.
at the same time, the present study demonstrates the
lesion-worsening effect of 5-ht on  xxxd102xxx induced gastric
lesions in rats, in agreement with earlier results from our
laboratory [16] and with those of cho et al. [28]. this action is
likely to be mediated through an increase of neutrophil
infiltration and a significant decrease of gsh-px activity.
these findings imply that activated pmn and oxygen radicals
could be important factors aggravating  xxxd102xxx evoked
mucosal injury.
it has been reported that 5-ht might be one of the
pathological mediators for the mucosal-damaging action of
ethanol in rat stomach [3]. such ulcerogenic action is the
result not only of the reduction of systemic blood pressure
via 5-ht1 receptors but also of the constriction of mucosal
blood vessels by activation of 5-ht2 receptors. this could
produce ischaemia in the tissue and increase free-radical
production and lesion formation in the gastric mucosa [28].
previous findings using 5-ht2 antagonists such as  xxxd1785xxx  or  xxxd2419xxx  suggest that blockade of 5-ht2
receptors could significantly prevent gastric lesions caused
by oral administration of ethanol [28], by cold-restraint stress
[29], and by ischaemia-reperfusion [27].
although the mechanisms by which cnt acts are
incompletely characterized, studies in various models
suggest an effect via inhibition of the  xxxg1113xxx . in
the pithed rat preparation, for example, cnt blocked the
 xxxg1113xxx -mediated pressor response to intravenous
injection of 5-ht, being 7 and 10 times more potent than
ritanserin and  xxxd2419xxx  respectively [30]. in the mouse,
cnt blocked the 5-ht2-mediated head shaking induced by
quipazine, being equipotent to ritanserin in this model [31].
cnt was also found effective in models measuring effects
mediated via stimulation of 5-ht1 receptors [31]. in
transmurally stimulated guinea pig ileum preparations, it
reversed the inhibition of the twitch response induced by
 xxxg1108xxx  and 5-ht1b agonists [32]. thus, it is possible that
the protective action of the drug on ethanol ulceration could
be partly the result of its agonist and antagonist activity
on 5-ht1 and 5-ht2 receptors respectively [16].
at the same time, cnt is a prokinetic agent which
stimulates motility in the gastrointestinal tract by indirectly
facilitating acetylcholine release from the myenteric plexus
via stimulation of the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor. in contrast to other
benzamides, cnt does not antagonize the  xxxg1116xxx 
[13]. it has been reported that improving evacuations of the
stomach, and prevention of duodenogastric reflux play a
very important role in speeding the healing process of
gastric ulcers [3]. the introduction of these drug therapies
into practice is based on the results of experimental and
clinical studies which confirmed the importance of motility
