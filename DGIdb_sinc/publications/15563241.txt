abstract

 xxxd3158xxx  [nw 1015, pnu 151774e;  xxxd3158xxx ] is a potent anticonvulsant
and antiparkinsonian compound that is being developed by newron pharmaceuticals in europe. it has been shown to antagonise the calcium and sodium channels,
as well as inhibit monoamine oxidase type-b (mao-b). phase iii trials for the
treatment of parkinson’s disease are underway in germany and europe, while
phase ii trials in patients with epilepsy are ongoing in italy.
newron pharmaceuticals was founded at the end of 1998 after pharmacia &
upjohn announced its worldwide restructuring programme.
newron obtained the rights to  xxxd3158xxx , which pharmacia corporation (now
pfizer) had been developing as pnu 151774e.  xxxd3158xxx  was originated by
farmitalia-carloerba in italy. newron now owns all intellectual property associated with the drug.
a multinational phase ii trial for parkinson’s disease in europe has shown
positive results in slowing the progression of the disease; however, due to the
placebo-effect seen in this study, a longer (6-month) phase iib study is planned for
the second quarter of 2003.
in july 2003, newron received an ind from the us fda authorising a phase i
trial to confirm that no dietary restrictions are needed in patients while being
treated with  xxxd3158xxx . this study is be conducted in 12 healthy volunteers at the
university of vienna, austria, and will be followed by efficacy studies in
parkinson’s disease in the us.[1]
five phase i trials were completed in april 2001 in switzerland.  xxxd3158xxx 
combines sodium and calcium channel modulatory activity with monoamine
oxidase b inhibition.

1. profile
1.1 pharmacokinetics

clinical studies: volunteers were given single
ascending po doses of  xxxd3158xxx  according to a
double-blind, placebo-controlled design, each administration being separated from the next by ≥96h.
doses from 1–10 mg/kg were rapidly absorbed.
blood levels were linearly related to dose and the
half-life was 21–23h. half-life and linearity were
confirmed in a steady-state study in which 24 male

volunteers received po  xxxd3158xxx  1.25–5 mg/kg/
day. mean peak plasma levels were reached at about
2h and were in the order of 1–4.5 mug/ml. steadystate values were achieved on day 5.[2]
1.2 adverse events

animal toxicology:  xxxd3158xxx  showed no evidence of toxicity in mice and rats and, unlike
carbamazepine and  xxxd2908xxx , did not cause
hepatic enlargement.[3]

1.3 pharmacodynamics
1.3.1 epilepsy and seizure disorders

preclinical studies:  xxxd3158xxx  exhibited potent
and selective inhibitory action on monoamine oxidase-type b (mao-b) in rat brain homogenate
(ic50 = 0.17 mumol/l), with much less potent action
on mao-a (ic50 = 370 mumol/l).[4]
in rat liver homogenate,  xxxd3158xxx  inhibited
liver mao-b with ic50 values of 0.25, 0.14 and
0.13 mumol/l after preincubation for 2, 60 and 120
min, respectively.  xxxd3158xxx  had no effect on
mao-a activity in liver tissue.[3]
following oral administration of  xxxd3158xxx  (10
mg/kg) in rats, inhibition of brain mao-b activity
reached a maximum of 87% at 30 min postdose,
with mao-b activity gradually returning to normal
over a 48h period.[4]
no inhibition of mao-a activity was evident in
rats treated with  xxxd3158xxx , even at doses as high as
10 mg/kg. brain and liver mao-b activity was
inhibited by >90% at doses of  xxxd3158xxx  ≥10 mg/
kg and ≥20 mg/kg, respectively. however, mao-a
activity in the brain and liver was barely affected by
doses of  xxxd3158xxx  up to 60 mg/kg.[3]
in rat hippocampal slices,  xxxd3158xxx  inhibited
glutamate release induced by veratrine and kcl with
ic50 values of 56.4 and 185.5 mumol/l, respectively.
when administered prior to ischaemia in gerbils,

campal neurodegeneration more effectively than
phenytoin. when administered up to 3h after ischaemia,  xxxd3158xxx  significantly decreased brain ischaemic damage.  xxxd3158xxx , but not phenytoin,
attenuated the ischaemia-induced impaired passive
avoidance responding even when administered up to
3h after ischaemia.[5]
 xxxd3158xxx  inhibited seizures in mice during the
maximal electroshock bicuculline test,  xxxd2947xxx 
test, 3-mercaptopropionic acid test and the strychnine test with po ed50 values of 26.9, 8, 60.6, 21.5
and 104.1 mg/kg, respectively. the rotorod td50
value of  xxxd3158xxx  in mice was 626 mg/kg po.
these values generated favourable therapeutic indices when compared with established and new-generation anticonvulsant agents.[6]
 xxxd3158xxx  protected against kainate-induced
status epilepticus and hippocampal lesions in rats.
animals received  xxxd3158xxx  10–30 mg/kg ip
15 min before administration of kainic acid. 86% of
vehicle-treated animals developed status epilepticus
compared with 47–57% of animals treated with
 xxxd3158xxx  (p < 0.05). neurons in the ca4 hippocampal region were also significantly protected by
 xxxd3158xxx .[7]
in the amygdala fully kindled rat model of complex partial seizures,  xxxd3158xxx  (10 and 30 mg/kg
ip) significantly reduced the severity of the
behavioural seizures. seizure duration was significantly reduced with the lowest administered dose

(1 mg/kg). reductions in afterdischarge duration
were also reduced with  xxxd3158xxx , but this effect
did not reach statistical significance until rats received the 30 mg/kg dose. the anticonvulsant effects of  xxxd3158xxx  in this model occurred at doses
well below those causing toxicity. the effects of
 xxxd3158xxx  in this amygdala model of complex partial seizures were comparable to those of lamotrigine and gabapentin.[8]
in a study involving four cynomolgus monkeys,
 xxxd3158xxx  (50 mg/kg po) significantly shortened
electrically-induced afterdischarge duration in limbic areas, as measured by eeg. the behavioural
effects of limbic stimulation were dose-dependently
reduced by nw 1015.[9]
1.3.2 parkinson’s disease and movement disorders

results from a phase i trial with eight healthy
volunteers demonstrated that the ed50 for
 xxxg1358xxx  (mao b) inhibition
with oral  xxxd3158xxx  is 87.5 mug/kg/day. additionally, no mao a inhibition occurs after 10 mg/kg oral
dosing. therefore, these results suggest that restriction of tyramine intake is not required during
 xxxd3158xxx  treatment.[10]

1.4 therapeutic trials
1.4.1 parkinson’s disease and movement disorders

preliminary results from a phase ii study in patients with parkinson’s disease demonstrated that
 xxxd3158xxx  had efficacy in reducing the symptoms
associated with the disease. patients administered
 xxxd3158xxx  concurrent with dopamine agonist therapy exhibited a 30% reduction in motor scores. in
the multinational (italy, france, germany, belgium
and poland), double-blind, parallel study, 151 patients were randomised to  xxxd3158xxx  0.5 or 1 mg/kg
in a once-daily regimen, or placebo for 3 months.
patients were either treatment-naive (de novo patients), or  xxxd3158xxx  was added to a pre-existing
stable treatment with a dopamine agonist, currently
the recommended schedule for starting therapy in
parkinson’s disease. the addition of  xxxd3158xxx 
1 mg/kg/day resulted in a significant improvement,
with response defined as a ≥30% reduction of the
updrs iii motor scores, in those patients who were
treated with a steady dose of a dopamine agonist.
however, in the de novo patients,  xxxd3158xxx  provided a non-significant motor improvement, most
likely because of a strong placebo response often
seen in newly treated (for ≤3 months) patients. in
final results from this trial, the higher dose of
 xxxd3158xxx  (40–90 mg/day) increased responders to
37.5% compared with 30.9% in the low-dose
