transcriptional activation of the human  xxxg575xxx  gene (coding for  xxxg575xxx ) is mediated by the
 xxxg105xxx . in the present study we have examined interaction of the ginsenoside rg1 and
rb1 with the carcinogen activation pathway mediated by the  xxxg105xxx  in hepg2 cells. rtpcr was used to determine the  xxxg575xxx  mrna levels. the results showed that in hepg2 cells  xxxg575xxx  mrna
expression was signiﬁcantly increased in a concentration- and time- dependent manner by ginsenoside rg1
and rb1. ginsenoside rg1 and rb1 activated the dna-binding capacity of the  xxxg105xxx  for
the xenobiotic responsive element of  xxxg575xxx  as measured by the electrophoretic-mobility shift assay
(emsa). rg1 and rb1 were able to activate the ability of the  xxxg105xxx  to bind to an
oligonucleotide containing the xenobiotic-responsive element (xre) of the  xxxg575xxx  promoter. these results
indicate that rg1 and rb1's effects on  xxxg575xxx  induction are mediated by the  xxxg105xxx . since
 xxxg575xxx  and  xxxg105xxx  play important roles in carcinogenesis, development, differentiation
and many other essential physiological functions, these results suggest that the chemopreventive effect of
 xxxd2200xxx  may be due, in part, to ginsenoside rg1 and rb1's ability to compete with aryl hydrocarbons
for both the  xxxg105xxx  and  xxxg575xxx . rg1 and rb1 may thus be natural ligands and substrates
of the  xxxg105xxx  or have relationship with  xxxg105xxx  pathway. these
properties might be of help for future studies in p. ginseng and chemoprevention in chemical-induced cancer.

1. introduction
ginseng has been extensively used in traditional chinese medicine
for over 2000 years for treatment of various medical disorders, and since
18th century, it has been one of the most commonly used herbal
medicines in europe and north america. the major biologically active
constitutes of  xxxd2200xxx  are considered to be a series of saponin
glycosides collectively known as the ginsenosides. some studies showed
that ginsenosides have a variety of biomedical efﬁcacies such as
antioxidation and anti-inﬂammatory activities (attele et al., 1999). a
large number of medicinal or dietary plants have been shown to exhibit
substantial inhibitory effects on experimentally induced carcinogenesis,
and in many cases their chemopreventive activities are associated with
antioxidative and/or anti-inﬂammatory activities that some of their
ingredients retain (surh,1999). animal data suggest that treatment with
ginseng or  xxxd2200xxx  decrease the incidence of cancer in various
animal models. in epidemiological studies, ginseng consumers, compared with non-consumers, showed a decreased risk for various types of
cancer (yun and choi, 1995). though p. ginseng and its ingredients had

shown cancer-preventive potential, the possible mechanism of chemoprevention by ginseng were not well understood.
the  xxxg575xxx  ( xxxg575xxx ) is a member of the cytochrome
p-450 monooxygenase superfamily, which plays an important role in
xenobiotic metabolism as well as in carcinogenesis (gonzalez and
gelboin, 1994). the oral administration of  xxxd2200xxx  extract was
reported to decrease the incidence of 7,12-dimethylbenz[alpha]anthracene
(dmba)-initiated tumorigenesis of the lung and skin in mice. dmba is a
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that requires bioactivation to produce
carcinogenicity. this metabolic activation is catalyzed principally by
enzymes in the cytochrome p450 1 family.  xxxg575xxx  gene expression is
transcriptionally regulated by the  xxxg105xxx  (whitlock,
1999). the  xxxg105xxx  is a ligand-activated basic-helixloop-helix/per-arnt-sim (bhlh-pas) transcription factor (nebert et al.,
2004). the ligands for the  xxxg105xxx  include polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, such as 3-methylcholanthrene, benzo(a)pyrene,
polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, such as the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd), and certain congeners of polyhalogenated
biphenyls, however, also some natural ligands like indirubin and indigo
are strong agonists of the  xxxg105xxx . upon ligand
activation, the  xxxg105xxx  translocates into the nucleus
and binds to another basic helix-loop-helix pas protein called the aryl

hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (arnt) (whitlock, 1999). the
heterodimeric protein complex then binds to the enhancer sequence
(xenobiotic response element (xre)) located in the promoter region of
 xxxg105xxx -controlled genes, such as  xxxg575xxx  (rowlands
and gustafsson, 1997). receptor binding to the xre results in conformational changes in the chromatin structure in the  xxxg575xxx  promoter leading
to the subsequent transcriptional events (whitlock, 1999). due to the
importance of cyp1a in carcinogen activation, several studies have
examined the effect of dietary ﬂavonoids on the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor-mediated induction of  xxxg575xxx . curcumin (ciolino et al., 1998),
resveratrol (ciolino and yeh, 1999; casper et al., 1999), quercetin and
kaempferol (ciolino et al., 1999) are among the ﬂavonoids demonstrated
to be naturally occurring ligands of the  xxxg105xxx  and
these compounds can exert either agonist or antagonist activities.
p. ginseng and its ingredients had shown the cancer-preventive potential,
especially to carcinogen of environment-induced cancer, so it is
important to examine the interaction between ginseng or its constitutes
and  xxxg575xxx  may confer chemoprotection in chemical carcinogenesis. to
our knowledge, the interactions of components of p. ginseng with the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor pathway and their effect on expression of human
cyp1a have not been examined.
in the present study, we investigated the effect of ginsenoside rg1 and
rb1 on the mrna expression of human  xxxg575xxx  in hepg2 cells. results
indicated that  xxxg575xxx  mrna expression was signiﬁcantly increased in a
concentration- and time-dependent manner. emsa studies demonstrated
that both rg1 and rb1 could activate the ability of the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor to bind to an oligonucleotide containing the xre of the  xxxg575xxx 
promoter. these results demonstrated that rg1 and rb1 may be agonists
or (partial) antagonists of the  xxxg105xxx , capable of
competing with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or polyhalogenated
aromatic hydrocarbons for binding to the receptor and prevent carcinogen-induced cancer. so these ﬁndings may be useful in future studies
concerning ginseng or its constitutes as cancer preventive agents.

incubator.
hepg2 cells were maintained in 6-well plates, and when growth
reached 80% conﬂuency, the cells were treated with beta-nf, rg1 and rb1
in the medium without fetal bovine serum for addition of 2 h, 6 h, 12 h,
24 h and 48 h before harvest, total cellular rna was isolated with
trizol reagent (life technologies inc.).
2.3. rna isolation and rt-pcr analysis
total rna was isolated using trizol reagent (life technologies inc.)
according to the manufacturer's instruction for monolayer cells. the
mrna level of  xxxg575xxx  was determined by rt-pcr experiment with a
rna pcr kit (takara) as described in the instruction. total rna (0.5 mug)
was subjected to the synthesis of the ﬁrst strand cdna in a total
volume of 10 mul with oligo dt-adaptor primer and amv reverse
transcriptase. the reaction condition was: 42 °c for 30 min, 99 °c for
5 min and 5 °c for 5 min. the cdna (2 mul) was subjected to pcr

cttctccagggagga-3′. the designed primers were really speciﬁc for
 xxxg575xxx  mrna through blast and without spanning an intro/exon
boundary. pcr products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel and stained
with ethidium bromide. quantitative data normalized to  xxxg53xxx  were
obtained from a densitometer and analyzed with the included quantity

2.4. preparation of nuclear extract and electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (emsa) for  xxxg105xxx 
hepg2 cells were treated with dmso, beta-nf, rg1 or rb1 in growth
media for 6 h. nuclear protein was isolated (using ne-per® nuclear
and cytoplasmic extraction reagents kit 78833; pierce, rockford, il).
and emsa was conducted with the lightshift® chemiluminescent

commercially synthesized (invitrogen) containing the  xxxg105xxx -binding site of the xre of the  xxxg575xxx  promoter were
labeled with 5′-biotin. the  xxxg105xxx  probe consisted
of the xre sequence 5′-ggagttgcgtgagaagagcc-3′ and its
complementary. the binding reactions were carried out for 20 min
and contained 5 mug of nuclear protein. to determine speciﬁcity of
binding to the oligonucleotide, a 200-fold excess of unlabeled xre was
added to extract from beta-nf, rg1 or rb1 treated cells. dna–protein
complexes were separated under nondenaturing conditions on a 6%
polyacrylamide gel using 0.5 × tbe (45 mm tris, ph 7.5, 45 mm boric

3. results
3.1. concentration-dependent induction of  xxxg575xxx  mrna expression by
ginsenoside rg1 and rb1
to investigate the effects of rg1 and rb1 treatment on  xxxg575xxx 
mrna expression, rt-pcr was ﬁrst used to analyze mrna level in
hepg2 cells treated with 10, 100, 1000 mum rg1, rb1 or 30 mum beta-nf as a
positive control for 6 h. as shown in fig. 1,  xxxg575xxx  mrna levels were
increased in beta-nf treated hepg2 cells compared with their untreated
counterparts, indicated that the hepg2 cells can serve as a sensitive
and selective model for predicting the regulation of  xxxg575xxx  modulation by drugs and other xenobiotics. both rg1 and rb1 caused a
concentration-dependent increase in the amount of  xxxg575xxx  mrna.
the level of  xxxg575xxx  mrna was signiﬁcantly increased in cells exposed
to rg1 and rb1 at concentration of 10, 100, 1000 mum respectively.
3.2. time-dependent induction of  xxxg575xxx  mrna expression by ginsenoside
rg1 and rb1
treatment with rg1 and rb1 for 6 h caused an increase in  xxxg575xxx 
mrna accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner from 10 to
1000 mum, so time course of  xxxg575xxx  mrna expression caused by
ginsenoside was conducted with 100 mum rg1 and rb1. rg1 and rb1 at
100 mum both caused a rapid increased in  xxxg575xxx  transcript that reach a
maximum after 6 h of incubation but still elevated after 48 h incubation,
especially the rg1 treatment (fig. 2). 100 mum concentration of either rg1
or rb1 could induce a time-dependent increase in  xxxg575xxx  mrna.
3.3. effect of ginsenoside rg1 and rb1 on  xxxg105xxx 
activation
ginsenoside rg1 and rb1 caused a time- and concentrationdependent increase in the amount of  xxxg575xxx  mrna in hepg2 cells,

fig. 2. time course of  xxxg575xxx  mrna induction caused by ginsenoside. hepg2 cells were maintained in 6-well plates, and when growth reached 80% conﬂuency, cells were treated
with 100 mum rg1, rb1 or 30 mum beta-nf at the indicated time course. the cells were harvested and total rna was isolated with trizol (life technologies) , cdna was synthesized, and the
amount of mrna was analyzed by semiquantitative rt-pcr assay. results represent the mean of three independent experiments and the gel bands shown are from a representative
experiment. asterisks indicated a statistically signiﬁcant difference compared with untreated cells. (⁎p b 0.05, ⁎⁎p b 0.01, ⁎⁎⁎p b 0.001).

fig. 3. effect of rg1 and beta-nf on dna-binding activity of nuclear  xxxg105xxx . cells were treated with dmso (control, lane 2), 30 mum beta-nf (lane 3) or the indicated
concentrations of rg1 (lanes 5, 6, and 7) for 3 h. 5 mug nuclear extracts were isolated, incubated with labeled xre sequence and subjected to emsa. competition was performed with
nuclear extract treated with 100 mum rg1 (lane 8) and 30 mum beta-nf (lane 4) pretreated with 200 fold excess of unlabelled dre. only the labeled dre probes were added to reaction
system (lane 1). the double arrows indicated the speciﬁc binding of  xxxg105xxx  complex to xre. the single arrow indicated the free probes. results are representative
of two separate experiments.

one of the potential mechanisms for ginsenoside rg1 and rb1induced  xxxg575xxx  mrna expression is for nuclear translocation of the
 xxxg105xxx  and formation of the transcriptionactivating complex  xxxg105xxx -arnt and binding to
the xre sequences. to test this hypothesis, we performed an emsa
assay using nuclear extract of rg1-, rb1- and beta-nf- treated hepg2
cells. cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of rg1 and
rb1 for 3 h and their nuclear extracts were subjected to emsa,
extracts from beta-nf -treated cells were run as a positive control. beta-nf
at 30 mum caused an obvious increase in the dna-binding ability of aryl
hydrocarbon receptor for an oligonucleotide containing the xre (fig. 3
lane 3 and fig. 4 lane 7) compared with controls (fig. 3 lane 2 and
fig. 4 lane 2). rg1  xxxd1891xxx , 100 and 1000 mum caused an increase in the
binding of  xxxg105xxx -arnt to the xre consensus
sequence in a concentration-dependent manner compared with
controls that was maximal at 1000 mum (fig. 3 lane 5, lane 6, and

lane 7). rb1  xxxd1891xxx , 100 and 1000 mum also caused an increase in the
binding of  xxxg105xxx -arnt to the xre consensus
sequence compared with controls that was maximal  xxxd1891xxx  mum (fig. 4
lane 3, lane 4, and lane 5). the speciﬁcity of this band as an aryl
hydrocarbon receptor -mediated gel shift was conﬁrmed by pretreating nuclear extract from cells treated with 100 mum rg1(fig. 3 lane 8),
100 mum rb1 (fig. 4 lane 6) or 30 mum beta-nf (fig. 3 lane 4 and fig. 4 lane
8), the binding shift was abolished in the presence of excess unlabelled
xre. these observation are in interesting contrast with the results of
rt-pcr, suggesting that rg1 and rb1 induced  xxxg575xxx  transcription at
the step of  xxxg105xxx -arnt binding.

including compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g.
3-methylcholanthrene, benzo(a)pyrene), polyhalogenated aromatic
hydrocarbons, and certain congeners of polyhalogenated biphenyls.
animal data suggested that treatment with ginseng or ginseng root
extract decreases the incidence of cancer in various animal models.
ginseng showed an inverse association with major cancers of
digestive (stomach, liver) and respiratory (lung) organs. results from
a cohort and two case-control studies in korea suggest that the intake
of ginseng may reduce the risk of several types of cancer (yun and
choi, 1990, 1995). when ginseng was tested in animal models, a
reduction in cancer incidence and multiplicity at various sites was
noted. p. ginseng and its chemical constituents have been tested for
their inhibiting effect on putative carcinogenesis mechanisms e.g., cell
proliferation and apoptosis (park and hwang, 1996), immunosurveillance (mizuno et al., 1994; yang et al., 1986), angiogenesis (rhee et al.,
1991); in most experiments inhibitory effects were found. decreased
activation of carcinogens due to modulation of the cyp1a enzymes
has been proposed as a possible chemopreventive mechanism, to our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report demonstrating that the interactions
of components of p. ginseng with the  xxxg105xxx 
pathway and their effect on induction human cyp1a gene expression
at the level of transcription.
we ﬁrst used the hepg2 cell line to examine the effects of
ginsenoside rg1 and rb1 on the major carcinogen-activating enzyme
 xxxg575xxx  gene expression. using rt-pcr, we found that rg1 and rb1
caused an increase in the accumulation of  xxxg575xxx  mrna (fig. 1). this
result was conﬁrmed by rt-pcr in fig. 2, which demonstrated that rg1
and rb1 induced  xxxg575xxx  mrna in a time-dependent manner. the
increase in  xxxg575xxx  mrna caused by rg1 and rb1 was rapid but
transient, reaching a maximum after 6 h and declining by 24 h. based on
these observations, it is strongly indicated that rg1 and rb1 interact
with the  xxxg575xxx  enzyme at the transcriptional level in the hepg2 cells
and presumably also in the normal human liver. it might be difﬁcult to
estimate, but how physiological are the concentrations of rg1 and rb1
that are used. so concentrations of these compounds used in the present
study are in a broad range from10 mum to 1000 mum with inductive effects
on  xxxg575xxx , and the physiological concentration may be included in this
range. the ability of the ligand-bound  xxxg105xxx  to
induce  xxxg575xxx  transcription is dependent on its ability to bind the xre
in the 5′ promoter region of the  xxxg575xxx  gene (chang et al., 2002). in
order to further understand the mechanism of induction of  xxxg575xxx  by
rg1 and rb1, using emsa, we examined in hepg2 cells whether rg1 and
rb1 could activate the dna-binding capacity of the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor. this was conﬁrmed in (figs. 3 and 4), which demonstrates that
rg1 and rb1 caused an obvious activation of the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor. that the band shift speciﬁcity caused by rg1 and rb1 was due
to activation of the  xxxg105xxx  was shown in (figs. 3
and 4) by the ability of unlabeled probe containing the xre of  xxxg575xxx  to
compete away the band-shift. these data, in conjunction with the
observed increase in the amount of  xxxg575xxx  mrna (figs. 1 and 2),
suggest that the induction of cyp1a expression is most likely due to the
ability of rg1 and rb1 of ginseng to interact directly with the receptor
and function as ligand of the  xxxg105xxx , but ligand
binding assays would be necessary to conﬁrm direct competitive
binding to the receptor in future study. it must be noted that the agonist
activity of rg1 and rb1, even at the highest concentration treated, was
much less than that of beta-nf. this suggests that rg1 and rb1 possess aryl
hydrocarbon receptor agonist activity, albeit weak. it is also possible that
rg1 and rb1 are (partial) antagonists of the  xxxg105xxx .
an antagonist like for example alpha-naphthoﬂavone activities cyp1a a
little at high concentrations, however it also shows strong antagonistic
activity. since  xxxg575xxx  and  xxxg105xxx  play important
roles in carcinogenesis, development, differentiation and many other
essential physiological functions, the chemopreventive effect of
p. ginseng may be due, in part, to ginsenoside rg1 and rb1 as (partial)
antagonists to compete with aryl hydrocarbons for both the aryl

77

hydrocarbon receptor and  xxxg575xxx  or a likely mechanism is that rg1 and
rb1 with weak agonist activity induce the activity of drug metabolism
enzymes clearing carcinogenic compounds from the body. the complete
 xxxd2200xxx  increased  xxxg575xxx  enzyme activity of rat in a
concentration-dependent manner (data not shown), whether the
 xxxd2200xxx  has the effect on  xxxg105xxx  is not clear
and needs further investigation.
the increase in  xxxg575xxx  mrna caused by rg1 and rb1 were rapid but
transient, reaching a maximum after 6 h and declining by 24 h (fig. 2).
the reason for this rapid decline was not related to the concentration of
rg1 and rb1 that cytotoxicity occurs or the compound incubations are
performed without the addition of serum. the viability of the hepg2
cells in our experiment depended on the cell states before the
compound incubations being performed. previous reports have shown
 xxxg575xxx  mrna can be detected in hepg2 cells by rt-pcr and that this
mrna with its half-life of 2.4 h was one of the shortest-lived mrna
studied and is the most unstable of the cytochrome p450 mrnas they
have tested. the rapid decay of  xxxg575xxx  mrna is associated with a rapid
loss in poly(a) tail length, suggesting that deadenylation is the ﬁrst step
in the decay pathway and the short half-life of  xxxg575xxx  appears to be
conserved across species (poli et al., 2000).
the in vitro studies suggested that the standardized p. ginseng
( xxxd2200xxx ) extract ( xxxg115xxx ) and the standardized panax quinquefolius (north american ginseng) extract (nage) could inﬂuence some
human p450 activities, but naturally occurring ginsenosides, including
rb1, rb2, rc, rd, re, rf, or rg1, were not likely to inhibit drugmetabolizing enzymes (chang et al., 2002; henderson et al., 1999).
 xxxg575xxx  encodes the enzyme  xxxg575xxx , the primary carcinogen-activating enzyme in mcf-7 cells under conditions of aryl hydrocarbon
receptor activation. treatment of mcf-7 cells with quercetin resulted
in a concentration- and time-dependent increase in enzyme activity
follows the increase in  xxxg575xxx  mrna (ciolino et al., 1999). in the
present study, treatment of hepg2 cells with rg1 and rb1 resulted in
an increase in  xxxg575xxx  mrna expression via  xxxg105xxx ,
which suggested that rg1 and rb1 could inﬂuence the  xxxg575xxx  enzyme
activity from transcription at the step of  xxxg105xxx  arnt binding under the in vivo condition and not serve as an inhibitor
to  xxxg575xxx  enzyme activity under the in vitro condition.
the broad transcriptomic proﬁling has been used in many
laboratories to attempt to identify patterns of aryl hydrocarbon
receptor-regulated gene response that may be predictive of toxic potential in cells or tissues exposed to various environments contaminants,
therapeutic agents and dietary products of plant origin. potential toxicity
or healthy properties of  xxxg105xxx  ligands may be
predicted more effectively by proﬁling full sets of genes that respond
rather than only a few genes such as  xxxg575xxx  and cyp1a2 (de waard
et al., 2008). tcdd and ginsenoside rg1 and rb1 are both aryl
hydrocarbon receptor activators. however tcdd has toxic properties
and ginsenosides have healthy properties. is this just a difference in
strength/metabolic stability/ or activate these compounds different
pathways. recently, numerous studies showed that many compounds
which induce  xxxg575xxx  do so without necessarily binding the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor. it is likely that  xxxg1556xxx  p45 related factor 2 (nrf2)
could modulate  xxxg105xxx  signaling (shin et al., 2007).
as nrf2 activation is often linked to ‘healthy’ compounds (antioxidants),
this might be a potential mechanism for rg1 and rb1. gene proﬁling
needs further investigation and may be useful to give answer to this.
it is remarkable that two so seemingly similar compounds in
structure as rg1 and rb1 have the same effects on aryl hydrocarbon
receptor activation and  xxxg575xxx  induction. both compounds belong to
triterpenoid glycosides of the damm-aran series. rg1 is a protopanaxatriol compound and rb1 is a protopanaxadiol compound (yun et al.,
1997), therefore it is indicated that the group differences between rg1
and rb1 may have little effect on  xxxg105xxx  activation
and  xxxg575xxx  induction, the moiety of triterpenoid glycosides seems to
be an important feature.

in summary, we have demonstrated that rg1 and rb1, activate the
 xxxg105xxx , and induce  xxxg575xxx  mrna accumulation.
these results suggest but do not prove conclusively that rg1 and rb1
are ligands of the  xxxg105xxx . because chemical
carcinogens are metabolized by the same enzyme systems that
metabolize drugs, studies on the effects of natural products that
inﬂuence drug metabolism in humans may lead to new approaches for
stimulating the detoxiﬁcation or inhibiting the metabolic activation of
environmental carcinogens.
