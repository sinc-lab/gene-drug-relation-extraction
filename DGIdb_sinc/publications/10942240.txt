calicheamicin-conjugated humanized anti- xxxg382xxx  mouse monoclonal antibody,  xxxd2190xxx , has recently been introduced to clinics as a promising drug to treat patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (aml) in relapse. however, the mechanism of action
of  xxxd2190xxx  has not been well elucidated. the cytotoxic effect
of  xxxd2190xxx  on hl60, nomo-1, nb4, nkm-1, k562, daudi, and
the multidrug-resistant sublines, nomo-1/adr and nb4/mdr,
was investigated by cell cycle distribution and morphology.
these studies were done by a video-microscopic system, dna
fragmentation, dye exclusion and 3h-thymidine uptake after
analysis of  xxxg382xxx , cd34, p-glycoprotein (p-gp), multidrug resistance (mdr)-associated protein and lung-related protein on
these cells. a dose-dependent, selective cytotoxic effect of
 xxxd2190xxx  was observed in cell lines that expressed  xxxg382xxx , and
was dependent on the amount of  xxxg382xxx  and the proliferative
speed of the cells. sensitive cells were temporally arrested at
the g2/m phase before undergoing morphological changes.
 xxxd2190xxx  is not effective on p-gp-expressing multidrug-resistant sublines compared with parental cell lines. mdr modifiers,
ms209 and  xxxd3488xxx , restored the cytotoxic effect of  xxxd2190xxx 
in p-gp-expressing sublines.  xxxd2190xxx  is a promising agent in
the treatment of patients with aml that expresses  xxxg382xxx . the
combined use of  xxxd2190xxx  and mdr modifiers may increase the
selective cytotoxic effect in multidrug-resistant aml. leukemia

introduction
seventy to 80% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(aml) achieve complete remission by intensive chemotherapy, but more than 50% of them relapse, often associated
with clinical drug resistance.1–4 to overcome the resistance,
multidrug resistance (mdr) modifiers and new antileukemia
agents have been tested clinically.5–8
therapy based on monoclonal antibodies (mabs) has been
used in an attempt to increase the selectivity of cytotoxic
agents by conjugating them with a mab that targets tumor
cells. cytotoxic agents that have been attached to mabs and
tested clinically to date include radioactive isotopes,9 phytotoxins,10 enzymes converting prodrugs to active drugs at
tumor sites,11 and standard anticancer agents.12 although progress has continued with each of these agents, they all still
have drawbacks, and little clinical success has been achieved
in leukemia until recently. one of the major limitations of
these conjugates is their lack of potency. the cytotoxic ability
of conjugates is related to several factors, such as the amount
of antigen expression, adequate targeting on tumor-associated

antigens, internalization of the conjugate, release of the cytotoxic moiety within the cells, potency of the cytotoxic agent
once released intracellularly and its efflux.
 xxxg382xxx , a 67 kda glycoprotein, is found on the surface of
myeloid cells and belongs to the  xxxg2071xxx  family of proteins.13 the exact function of  xxxg382xxx  is not known, but it may
be involved in adhesion or cell-to-cell communication.  xxxg382xxx 
is expressed on leukemia cells from more than 90% of patients
with aml, but is neither expressed on normal hematopoietic
stem cells nor on non-myeloid tissues.14 therefore,  xxxg382xxx  is
a useful target for the development of therapeutic agents in
aml. because  xxxg382xxx  is rapidly internalized after antibody
binding, an antibody–cytotoxic agent conjugate can effectively be taken into leukemia cells. in fact, radiolabeled and
cytotoxic chemotherapy labeled anti- xxxg382xxx  antibodies have
been developed, including conjugates of131i-radioisotope, calicheamicin derivatives, gelonin and ricin.15–21 the most
encouraging results presented to date have been with cma676.  xxxd2190xxx  is a conjugate of a cytotoxic agent, a calicheamicin derivative, linked to a recombinant humanized antibody (igg4) directed against the  xxxg382xxx  antigen. calicheamicin
belongs to a family of very potent enediyne antitumor antibiotics that bind to the minor groove of dna in a sequencespecific manner.22–24 deuterium-labeling experiments showed
that the observed double-stranded dna breaks are caused by
the abstraction of specific hydrogen atoms from the deoxyribose rings of dna by diradical,25 and the resultant damage
to dna is likely to be the initial step in cell death. a phase
ii study of  xxxd2190xxx  in aml is in progress, and a promising
result has been reported.26 however, the effect on the cell
cycle distribution has not been reported, and it is not clear
whether this dna damage is related to apoptosis or not.27,28
moreover, the effect on the cells that acquired multidrug
resistance has not been elucidated.
materials and methods

cell lines
the cell lines used were a human  xxxg1785xxx 
cell line, hl60; a human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell
line, k562 (riken cell bank, tsukuba, japan);29 a human promonocytic leukemia cell line, nomo-1, and its doxorubicinresistant subline, nomo-1/adr (kindly provided by dr m
ogura, aichi cancer center, nagoya, japan);30 a human acute
myeloid leukemia cell line, nkm-1; and a human epstein–
barr virus (ebv)-positive lymphoma cell line, daudi (the
american type culture collection, rockland, md, usa). a
human apl cell line, nb4 (kindly provided by dr m lanotte,
hospital saint-louis, paris, france), and its mdr-1 dna-transducted nb4 sublines, nb4/mdr, were also used. nb4/mdr

these cell lines were cultured in rpmi1640 supplemented
with l-glutamine (2 mm), antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum
(fcs) (gibco brl, grand island, ny, usa) at 37°c in a
humidified 5% co2 incubator. cultures were initiated by
seeding 2 × 105 cells/ml of fresh medium, and maintained at
2 to 5 × 105 cells/ml, adjusting cell concentrations by adding
fresh culture medium. doxorubicin (4 × 10−7 m) was added
every 2 weeks to the culture medium of nomo-1/adr cell
lines. vincristine sulfate was added every 2 weeks to the
culture medium of nb4/mdr.31,32

flow cytometric analysis for  xxxg382xxx  and cd34
for the detection of  xxxg382xxx  and cd34, cells were stained with
phycoerythrin-conjugated anti- xxxg382xxx  mab (becton dickinson
immunocytometry systems, san jose, ca, usa) and peridinin
chlorophyll protein (percp)-conjugated anti-cd34 mab
(becton dickinson) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ten thousands events were counted with the epics xl
flow cytometer (beckman coulter, fullerton, ca, usa).

flow cytometric analysis for p-glycoprotein, mrp and
lrp
for p-glycoprotein (p-gp) analysis, cells underwent a reaction
with biotinylated mrk16 (fab⬘) mouse mab or a subclassmatched control mab and were then stained with streptavidin-red670 (gibco brl) as previously described.31,32 for the
analysis of mrp and lrp, cells were first fixed using a mixture
of 2% formaldehyde solution and acetone and were then
incubated with anti-mrp or anti-lrp mab (nitirei, tokyo,
japan) for 1 h. after being washed, cells were stained with
fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse
f(ab⬘)2 (dako japan, tokyo, japan) as reported previously.33
ten thousands events were counted using the epics elite flow
cytometer (beckman coulter). the degree of dissociation
between the fluorescence intensity of cells that reacted with
mrk16, anti-mrp or anti-lrp mab and that of respective subclass-matched mab was analyzed by the channel-by-channel
subtraction method using the immuno-4 routine of the epics
cytometer software (beckman coulter). the value was defined
as the percentage of p-gp, mrp or lrp.31,32,34,35 the cell count
in each channel of the control histogram was subtracted from
the cell count in the corresponding channel of the test histogram, and the percent accumulation was calculated from the
sum of the difference for all channels.

reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay
for  xxxg10xxx  expression
total cellular rna was extracted according to the acid-guanidinium-phenol-chloroform technique. complementary dna
(cdna) was synthesized with a cdna synthesis kit (gibco
brl) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.31 in total
40 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) were performed,
using an automatic pcr processor (perkin elmer cetus,
norwalk, ct, usa).

humanized anti- xxxg382xxx  mab and calicheamicin-conjugated
one,  xxxd2190xxx , were kindly provided by the wyeth-ayerst
research division of american home products (radnor, pa,
usa).  xxxd2190xxx  consists of three essential parts: an antibody,
a cytotoxic agent, and a linker. the antibody, humanized
igg4 (hp67.6), targets the  xxxg382xxx  antigen. the cytotoxic agent
is n-acetyl-gamma calicheamicin dimethyl  xxxd2396xxx  (nacgamma calicheamicin dmh), a derivative of calicheamicin
antitumor antibiotics, which contains a modified calicheamicin nucleus, a hindered disulfide and a  xxxd2396xxx .22–24 the

cells were plated in a 96-well microplate (becton dickinson,
lincoln park, nj, usa) at 2 × 105 cells per well in 100 ␮l of
rpmi 1640 containing 10% fcs and 1 ␮ci of 3h-thymidine.

cell viability was quantified by flow cytometry with pi staining. cells were collected from culture and washed twice with
pbs. the centrifuged cell pellet was gently resuspended in
1.0 ml of pi solution containing 5 ␮g of pi (sigma). the orange
fluorescence of the cells was measured using the epics profile
ii (beckman coulter).

morphological analysis by a video-microscopic
technique
cells were plated in a glass-bottomed dish (mattek corporation, ashland, usa) at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells in
1.2 ml of medium. the medium was rpmi 1640 containing
10% fcs with 10 ng/ml  xxxd2190xxx  or the humanized anticd33 mab (hp67.6). after 12- and 24-h incubation at 37°c,
cells were observed under an inverted nomarski microscope
(axiovert 35; zeiss, oberkochen, germany) equipped with a
×100 different interference contrast (dic) objective lens and
a ×2.5 insertion lens. optical images were detected by using
a charge-coupled device (ccd) camera (ti-23p; nec, tokyo,
japan), and the contrast of image was enhanced with a highspeed digital image processor (pip-4000, ads, osaka, japan).
the processed image was observed on the monitor screen (14
inch, b/w, panasonic; osaka, japan) and was recorded on a
videotape with an s-vhs video cassette recorder (ag-7500;
panasonic).36 figures used in this paper were reproduced from
still frames in this video record.

dna fragmentation assay
dna fragmentation assay was performed as described previously37 with slight modification. briefly, cells (2 × 106) were
immersed in cytolysis buffer consisting of 100 ␮l of 100 mm
tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 10 mm edta and 0.5% triton x-100. the
mixture was treated with 400 ␮g/ml  xxxg1963xxx  (sigma) and then
with 400 ␮g/ml proteinase k (sigma). dna was extracted with
phenol–chloroform, precipitated with isopropylalcohol, dissolved in 10 ␮l of 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4) and 1 mm edta,
and separated in 2% agarose gels. dna was visualized by
staining with ethidium bromide.

h-thymidine uptake in hl60 cells

1439

after 12-, 24- and 48-h incubation, 3h-thymidine uptakes of
hl60 cells incubated with 5, 10 and 100 ng/ml of  xxxd2190xxx 
were lower in a dose-dependent manner than that in the control containing no  xxxd2190xxx  (figure 2). the counts per minute
measured after 48-h incubation at 5, 10, 100 ng/ml of cma676 were 72.9%, 68.7% and 57.6%, respectively, of the control. 3h-thymidine uptake of cells incubated with non-conjugated anti- xxxg382xxx  was not significantly different from that of
the control.

cell growth assay by flow cytometry
viable cell counts were calculated as follows: viable cell
counts = (total cell counts) − (pi stained cell counts). the
results are shown in figure 3. in hl60, nomo-1, nb4 and
nkm-1 cells,  xxxd2190xxx  suppressed the cell growth at 5, 10
and 100 ng/ml in a dose-dependent manner. in k562 cells,
only 100 ng/ml of  xxxd2190xxx  inhibited the growth. on the
other hand, in daudi cells,  xxxd2190xxx  did not suppress the
growth at all at 100 ng/ml. although both are meaninglessly
high concentrations for clinical use, 1000 and 10 000 ng/ml
of  xxxd2190xxx  suppressed the cell growth of daudi cells, and
the viable cell counts after 48-h incubation were 67% and
18% of the control, respectively.

(99.9%), nomo-1/adr (99.9%), nb4 (99.7%), nb4/mdr
(99.9%) and nkm-1 (99.9%) cells, but cd34 was not
expressed on these cells. in k562 cells,  xxxg382xxx  was partially
expressed (62.9%) and cd34 was not expressed. neither
 xxxg382xxx  nor cd34 was expressed on daudi cells.

cell cycle distribution patterns after the 48-h incubation with
10 and 100 ng/ml of  xxxd2190xxx  are shown in figures 4 and 5.
hl60, nomo-1 and nb4 cells were arrested at the g2/m
phase, and the hypodiploid portions increased. in nkm-1
cells, the effect was less at both concentrations (figure 4). in
k562 and daudi cells, a little effect was observed only at
100 ng/ml (figure 5), and the cell cycle distribution patterns
were virtually the same after the 24-h incubation with cma676. although both are meaninglessly high concentrations for
clinical use, 1000 ng/ml of  xxxd2190xxx  arrested partly and 10
000 ng/ml of  xxxd2190xxx  greatly arrested the cell cycle at the
g2/m phase in daudi cells.

 xxxd2190xxx  did not suppress the cell growth of nomo-1/adr
and nb4/mdr. in the presence of 10 ␮m ms209,  xxxd2190xxx 
recovered the cytotoxic effect and suppressed the cell growth
in a dose-dependent manner (figure 6).
in the presence of 10 ␮m  xxxd3488xxx ,  xxxd2190xxx  also recovered
the cytotoxic effect and suppressed the cell growth in a dosedependent manner (figure 6).

ms209 (figures 7, 8 right), and in the presence of 10 ␮m

morphological observation by a video-microscopic
technique
the hl60 cells became enlarged after 24-h incubation with
10 ng/ml of  xxxd2190xxx  compared with the control with the
anti- xxxg382xxx  mab alone (figure 9). morphological changes of
apoptosis characterized by bleb formation and shrinkage of
cells were observed in 15% of the cells.

dna fragmentation assay in hl60 cells
dna fragmentation assay was done after incubation for 0, 6,
12, 24, 48 and 72 h with 100 ng/ml of  xxxd2190xxx  in hl60
cells. dna ladder formation was not observed (data not
shown).
leukemia

 xxxg382xxx -positive leukemia cell lines, such as hl60, nomo-1
and nb4 cells, were killed by the exposure to  xxxd2190xxx ,
while  xxxg382xxx -negative cell lines, such as daudi cells, were not.
therefore,  xxxd2190xxx  acted selectively on  xxxg382xxx -positive cells.
some anticancer drugs, such as paclitaxel, arrest the cell cycle
at the g2/m phase and induce cell death.  xxxd2190xxx  also
arrested the cell cycle at the g2/m phase and induced cell
death in hl60, nomo-1 and nb4 cells. k562 cells, which
express lower amounts (62.9%) of  xxxg382xxx  and proliferate rapidly, were not influenced by lower concentrations of cma676. in daudi cells, which expressed no  xxxg382xxx ,  xxxd2190xxx  did
not suppress the cell growth but slightly arrested the cell cycle
at the g2/m phase only at the concentration of 100 ng/ml.
although it is a meaninglessly high concentration for clinical
use, 10 000 ng/ml of  xxxd2190xxx  suppressed the cell growth
and arrested the cell cycle at the g2/m phase in daudi cells.
this effect might be explained by the detached calicheamicin
from  xxxd2190xxx  at the highest concentration. on the other
hand, the non-conjugated humanized anti- xxxg382xxx  mab alone
did not act on  xxxg382xxx -positive cells even at 100 ng/ml. therefore, the cytotoxic effect of  xxxd2190xxx  must have specifically
been derived from calicheamicin.
complete elimination of blasts from peripheral blood and
bone marrow was observed in 20% of chemotherapy-resistant
patients enrolled in the phase i trial, with better results achieved in those treated with the higher doses and in those with
leukemia with lower mdr efflux.15 in the phase ii trial, 20 of
59 patients (34%) in first relapse achieved a remission
(characterized by ⬍5% blasts in the marrow, 1500/␮l neutrophils, and platelet transfusion independence prior to any
additional post-remission therapy).26  xxxd2190xxx  is a conju-

gate of a calicheamicin derivative linked to a humanized antibody directed against the  xxxg382xxx  antigen. after internalization
of  xxxd2190xxx  into cells, the calicheamicin derivative is supposed to be released via hydrolysis, and it binds to the minor
groove of dna in a sequence-specific manner. it is not clear
whether the dna damage caused by calicheamicin is related
to apoptosis or not.27,28 nicolaou et al27 reported that dna
damage induced by non-conjugated calicheamicin might lead
to apoptotic cell death. one the other hand, zhao et al28
reported that calicheamicin might lead to cell death through
the exhaustion of nad+ levels. the video-microscopic technique enabled us to observe cell morphology in a single cell
level and to explain this discrepancy. although 15% of hl60
cells had apoptotic changes, the remaining cells had no apoptotic features. thus, results of the present study, including the
dna fragmentation assay and the light scatter properties in
flow cytometry, suggested that  xxxd2190xxx  mainly induced nonapoptotic cell death. here, we did not compare calicheamicin
with  xxxd2190xxx , because calicheamicin was not available.
however, the cytotoxic mechanism of calicheamicin would
presumably be the same as that of  xxxd2190xxx  except for the
internalization via  xxxg382xxx  antigen.
 xxxd2190xxx  showed no effect on multidrug-resistant sublines
even if they expressed sufficient amounts of  xxxg382xxx . mdr is a
phenomenon in which malignant cells develop cross-resistance to a variety of unrelated cytotoxic drugs. mdr-1-associated p-gp is a membrane glycoprotein that actively pumps the
cytotoxic agent out from the cells and decreases intracellular
drug accumulation.38,39 therefore, calicheamicin derivatives
could also be pumped out from the cells. this hypothesis was
confirmed by a combined use of  xxxd2190xxx  and mdr modifiers in resistant sublines. ms209 is a novel quinoline compound that can overcome mdr both in vitro and in vivo.40

 xxxd3488xxx  is another potent mdr-reversing drug that is a nonimmunosuppressive analogue of cyclosporine.41 ms209 and
 xxxd3488xxx  recovered the cytotoxic effect of  xxxd2190xxx  in p-gpexpressing sublines. because  xxxg382xxx  is rapidly internalized following antibody binding, calicheamicin can effectively be
taken into cells. although it is not known whether calicheamicin is pumped out by p-gp at present, our experiments suggested that intracellularly released calicheamicin was probably pumped out via p-gp. additionally, in a phase i study of
 xxxd2190xxx , a high rate of clinical response was observed in
leukemias characterized by low dye efflux in vitro.15 in cma676, mdr modifiers theoretically work only on intracellularly
incorporated calicheamicin in  xxxg382xxx -positive cells. therefore,
the combined use of  xxxd2190xxx  and mdr modifiers may be an
ideal therapeutic approach on p-gp-related resistant tumors,

assuming that the hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities
are not worsened.
phase ii studies of  xxxd2190xxx  are now in progress. this new
agent will bring a considerable therapeutic benefit for patients
with  xxxg382xxx -positive aml. however, in relapsed or refractory
aml which expressed p-gp, the combined use of mdr modifiers has the potential to produce an improved therapeutic
ratio. clinical studies with mdr modifiers will be required to
determine whether an increase in efficacy occurs, and
whether any increase in efficacy is accompanied by worsening of associated adverse events.
