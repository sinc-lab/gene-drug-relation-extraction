gabaa receptors (gabars) are heteromultimeric proteins composed of five subunits. the specific subunit composition determines
critical properties of a gabar such as pharmacological sensitivities and whether the receptor contributes to synaptic or extrasynaptic
forms of inhibition. classically, synaptic but not extrasynaptic gabars are thought to respond to benzodiazepines, whereas the reverse
has been suggested for ethanol. to examine the effects of subunit composition on gabar function in situ, we took advantage of two
naturally occurring alleles of the rat gene for gabar subunit ␣6 ( xxxg835xxx  100r and  xxxg835xxx  100q). depending on their subunit partners,
these two variants of ␣6 can lead to differential sensitivities to benzodiazepines and ethanol. an examination of synaptic and extrasynaptic gaba-mediated currents in cerebellar granule cells from  xxxg835xxx  100r/100r and  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats uncovered marked alleledependent differences in benzodiazepine sensitivity. unexpectedly, we found that the benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and diazepam
enhanced extrasynaptic inhibition mediated by ␦ subunit-containing gabars in  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats. complementary experiments on
recombinant gabars confirmed that, at subsaturating [gaba], flunitrazepam potentiates ␣6/␦ subunit-containing gabars. based on
data and a simple theoretical analysis, we estimate that the average extrasynaptic [gaba] is ⬃160 nm in perfused slices. these results (1)
demonstrate contributions of ␣6 subunits to both synaptic and extrasynaptic gaba responses, (2) establish that ␦ subunit-containing
gabars are benzodiazepine sensitive at subsaturating [gaba] and, (3) provide an empirical estimate of extrasynaptic [gaba] in slices.

introduction
the multiple ways in which gabaergic neurotransmission
shapes neural activity can be attributed to two spatially and temporally unique modes of inhibition (brickley et al., 1996; wall
and usowicz, 1997; mody, 2001; farrant and nusser, 2005). phasic or synaptic inhibition is believed to result from high gaba
concentration transients acting on synaptic gaba receptors
(gabars) composed of two ␣ subunits (usually ␣1–␣3 or ␣5),
two ␤ subunits, and a ␥ subunit (farrant and nusser, 2005). in
contrast, tonic inhibition is thought to arise primarily from ambient gaba acting on extrasynaptic gabars containing two ␣4
or ␣6 subunits with two ␤ subunits and a ␦ subunit (mody, 2001;
farrant and nusser, 2005). these distinct subunit compositions
predict that synaptic and extrasynaptic gabars will show different sensitivities to benzodiazepines. this is because benzodiazepine sensitivity is believed to arise only in gabars containing
one of the “synaptic” ␣ subunits (wieland et al., 1992; mohler et

al., 2001) and a ␥2 subunit (barnard et al., 1998; hevers and
luddens, 1998). in contrast, gabars composed of “extrasynaptic” ␣ subunits in combination with ␦ are thought to be insensitive to benzodiazepines (saxena and macdonald, 1996).
many of the details of synaptic and extrasynaptic gabaergic
inhibition have been uncovered by studying cerebellar granule
cells (cgcs). these neurons express several gabar subunits
(␣1, ␣6, ␤2, ␤3, ␦, and ␥2) that, with the exception of the exclusively extrasynaptic ␦ subunits (nusser et al., 1998), are found in
both synaptic and extrasynaptic membranes. immunoprecipitation experiments show that ␦ subunits partner principally with
␣6 subunits (jechlinger et al., 1998; poltl et al., 2003). furthermore, knock-out mice confirm that ␦ and ␣6 subunits coassemble (jones et al., 1997) and are necessary for tonic inhibition
(brickley et al., 2001b; stell et al., 2003). interestingly, despite the
localization of ␣6 subunits within synaptic membranes (nusser
et al., 1998), deletion of the ␣6 gene has little effect on phasic
inhibition (brickley et al., 2001b).
recently, we described a naturally occurring single nucleotide
polymorphism in the rat gabar ␣6 subunit gene (hanchar et
al., 2005). previous work had shown that the resulting amino acid
change [␣6(r100q)] converts recombinant ␣6␤2␥2 gabars
from benzodiazepine insensitive to benzodiazepine sensitive
(korpi et al., 1993). however, the effect of this change in ␣6 on
the benzodiazepine sensitivity of synaptic and extrasynaptic cur-

rents in cgcs has not been tested. in the present study, we examine the benzodiazepine sensitivities of recombinant gabars
of various subunit composition and of phasic and tonic inhibitory currents in  xxxg835xxx  100r/100r and  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats. our
findings demonstrate that the substitution does affect native
gabars. the data indicate that ␣6 subunit-containing gabars
participate in synaptic and extrasynaptic inhibition in cgcs.
moreover, we unexpectedly find that both native and recombinant ␦ subunit-containing gabars can show benzodiazepine
sensitivity at subsaturating concentrations of gaba.

materials and methods
electrophysiology. parasagittal slices of the cerebellum (300 ␮m) from 21to 40-d-old sprague dawley rats homozygous for either ␣6 100r or
␣6 100q subunits were prepared using standard techniques (brickley et
al., 2001b; hanchar et al., 2005). the slicing solution consisted of the
following (in mm): 85 nacl, 75 sucrose, 24 nahco3, 25 glucose, 4
mgcl2, 2.5 kcl, 1.25 nah2po4, and 0.5 cacl2. slice storage and recording solutions were saturated with 95% o2/5% co2 and consisted of the
following (in mm): 119 nacl, 26 nahco3, 11 glucose, 2.5 kcl, 2.5 cacl2,
1.3 mgcl2, and 1 nah2po4. all procedures were in accordance with a
protocol approved by the university of california at los angeles chancellor’s animal research committee. for voltage-clamp recordings
(holding potential of ⫺70 mv, 20 –23°c), whole-cell pipettes contained
the following (in mm): 140 cscl, 10 hepes, 1 egta, 4 mg-atp, and 0.4
gtp, titrated to ph 7.3 with csoh. recording pipettes had a bath resistance of 5–10 m⍀.
standard methods were used for isolation, injection, and recordings
from xenopus laevis oocytes (wallner et al., 2003). briefly, oocytes were
injected with 0.4 ng of ␣ and ␤2 subunit crna and 2 ng of ␦ or ␥2 subunit
crna. gabar currents were recorded using an axoclamp 1d amplifier
(molecular devices, palo alto, ca) in two-electrode voltage-clamp configuration at a holding potential of ⫺80 mv. recordings were obtained
3– 4 d after oocyte injection for ␥2 subunit-containing receptors and
14 –15 d after injection for ␦ subunit-containing receptors. recording
electrodes contained 3 m kcl and had resistances between 0.5 and 1.5
m⍀. the recording solution consisted of the following (in mm): 96 nacl,
2 kcl, 1.8 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, and 5 hepes titrated to a ph of 7.5. solution
exchanges were triggered with a programmable valve bank switching a
three-way solenoid valve, and bath volume exchange occurred in 1–3 s.
analysis and statistics. whole-cell data were filtered at 5 khz and acquired at a sampling rate of 20 khz. analysis was conducted using customized routines written in igor pro 4.0 (wavemetrics, lake oswego,
or). because  xxxg981xxx  antagonists have been shown to alter
spontaneous ipsc (sipsc) frequency (brickley et al., 2001a), glutamate
receptor antagonists were not included in the recording solution. occasional epscs were identified by their characteristic rapid decay kinetics
and excluded from the analysis of spontaneous events (rossi and hamann, 1998; hanchar et al., 2005). unless stated otherwise, ipsc ␶decay is
reported as a weighted decay of biexponential decay fits to the average
traces of over 10 events in each cell. tonic gabar-mediated current was
defined as the steady-state current blocked by 10 ␮m sr95531 [6-imino3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1(6h)-pyridazinebutanoic acid hydrobromide]
its magnitude was calculated by plotting all-point histograms of relevant
30 s segments of data. these data were fit to gaussian equations, constraining fits to values two bins more negative than the peak. this ensured that the tail of higher-amplitude values (representing sipscs) did
not influence the fit.
as confirmation of the accuracy of this approach, we applied an additional analysis method in which baseline and tonic gaba current measurements were not contaminated by sipsc decays (nusser and mody,
2002). briefly, using the same 30 s segments mentioned above, the mean
and sd of 5 ms epochs of data taken every 100 ms were calculated. mean
values were accepted for additional analysis if the corresponding sd for
that 5 ms segment was ⬍4 pa. for experiments in 200 nm sr95331,
which decreased tonic currents by ⬃80% (data not shown), only cells
with ⬎2 pa tonic current in low sr95331 were included in the analysis.
in all cases, the effects of benzodiazepines on tonic current were com-

pared with changes in tonic current observed over otherwise identical
sham perfusion periods.
sigmastat for windows version 3.1 (systat software, port richmond,
ca) was used to perform statistical comparisons. normal distribution of
the datasets was assessed using the kolmogorov–smirnov test. normally
distributed data were analyzed using paired and unpaired student’s t
tests as appropriate. nonparametric wilcoxon’s signed rank test (wsrt
for paired data) or mann–whitney rank sum test (mwrst for unpaired
groups) was used to assess the statistical significance of data deviating
from normality. p values ⬍0.05 were accepted as significant. unless otherwise stated, values are reported as mean ⫾ sem.
theoretical prediction of [gaba] based on tonic current amplitude. the
curve in figure 6c was generated by applying the following hill equation:
itonic ⫽ itonic, max/[1 ⫹ (kd/[gaba])n], where kd was 700 nm, the ec50
was measured for recombinant ␣6␤3␦ gabars (hanchar et al., 2005),
and n, the hill exponent, was 2. itonic, max was estimated by using the
average amplitude of tonic current in 300 nm gaba (35 pa); solving the
hill equation predicted a maximal tonic current of 225 pa. using this
value for itonic, max we constructed predicted fold increases in response to
300 nm gaba given the amplitudes of the tonic currents in control. this
simple analysis assumes the following: (1) the level of itonic in control is
determined solely by the [gaba], (2) the gabars generating tonic current have properties similar to recombinant ␣6␤3␦ gabars, (3) all
cgcs have the same itonic, max, and (4) gaba uptake does not significantly reduce the effective [gaba] achievable by bath application at
extrasynaptic receptors. although these assumptions are clearly oversimplifications, if anything they are expected to decrease the accuracy of the
fit. goodness of fit (r 2 ⫽ 0.787) of the theoretical curve was calculated
using nonlinear regression analysis. considering that the theoretical
curve in figure 6c describes the data so well, we conclude that variations
in extrasynaptic [gaba] must be a major factor in determining the size
of itonic.

the ␣6(r100q) subunit polymorphism prolongs
synaptic currents
phasic, sipscs were recorded from cgcs of rats homozygous for
either the wild-type ( xxxg835xxx  100r) or the  xxxg835xxx  100q allele. consistent with previous reports (hanchar et al., 2005), there was no
difference in either sipsc amplitudes ( xxxg835xxx  100r/100r, 33.38 ⫾

1 a–c). however, in contrast to the lack of effect on sipsc amplitude/frequency, weighted decay rates of sipcss were significantly prolonged in rats expressing the  xxxg835xxx  100q allele (fig.
1 d, e). analysis of the fits to the sipsc decays discussed in the
next section argue that ␣6(100q) subunit-containing gabars
are present in synaptic rather than perisynaptic locations because
genotype-dependent differences are observed in the early phases
of sipsc decays. together, these data suggest that ␣6 contributes
to synaptic gabars and are consistent with previous reports that
the  xxxg835xxx  100q allele does not alter the levels of other gabar
subunits (korpi et al., 1993).
slower sipsc decays could reflect intrinsic differences in gating kinetics of gabars composed of ␣6(100r) versus ␣6(100q)
subunits. alternatively, the increased benzodiazepine sensitivity
of gabars containing ␣6(100q) and ␥ subunits might render
such gabars sensitive to an endogenous benzodiazepine-like
modulator. we tested the latter possibility by looking for
genotype-dependent differences in the effects of the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil (fz) (otis and mody, 1992). as
illustrated in figure 2, the drug had no effect on the sipsc decay
rate in either genotype [ xxxg835xxx  100r/100r, 4.84 ⫾ 0.28 ms in artificial csf (acsf) to 4.58 ⫾ 0.61 ms in flumazenil, n ⫽ 9;

 xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats. these findings provide additional support
for the idea that gabars with ␣6 subunits participate in phasic
inhibition.
the ␣6(r100q) polymorphism enhances benzodiazepine
sensitivity of synaptic currents
because the ␣6(r100q) polymorphism occurs at a site critical to
benzodiazepine modulation (wieland et al., 1992; korpi et al.,
1993), we examined whether the classical benzodiazepine flunitrazepam (flu) had a differential effect on sipscs in  xxxg835xxx  100r/100r
and  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats. flunitrazepam (1 ␮m) had no effect on
sipsc amplitude (fig. 3b), frequency ( xxxg835xxx  100r/100r, 1.41 ⫾

both genotypes ( xxxg835xxx  100r/100r, 6.29 ⫾ 0.81 ms in acsf,

acsf, 25.42 ⫾ 4.23 ms in flu; p ⬍ 0.05, t test). normalized data
also showed clear genotype-dependent effects on sipsc kinetics
(fig. 3c,d). for both genotypes, the effects of benzodiazepines
were prevented by the benzodiazepine site antagonist. flunitrazepam failed to prolong the sipsc decay when applied in the presence of flumazenil ( xxxg835xxx  100r/100r, 5.85 ⫾ 0.99 ms in acsf,
5.23 ⫾ 0.4 ms in flu, n ⫽ 3;  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q, 7.34 ⫾ 0.1.54 ms in
acsf, 6.56 ⫾ 1.01 ms in flu, n ⫽ 8; t test). the slower decay
observed in  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats led to a considerably larger
flunitrazepam enhancement of charge transfer in the
 xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats (fig. 3e). together, these data imply that the
␣6(r100q) polymorphism increases the benzodiazepine sensitivity of synaptic gabars.
the above analysis was conducted on weighted decay time
constants that simplify biexponential decay parameters to a single
value. yet by examining all parameters of double-exponential
fits, it might be possible to see whether a genotype-dependent
difference could be detected in the earliest phases of sipsc decays. in  xxxg835xxx  100r/100r rats, although no statistically significant
effect of flunitrazepam was observed on the fast (␶fast) (5.09 ⫾
0.22 ms in acsf, 7.87 ⫾ 1.43 ms in flu; t test) or slow (␶slow)
(23.03 ⫾ 3.87 ms in acsf, 20.19 ⫾ 2.67 ms in flu; t test) time
constants, the weight of the fast component was decreased
(96.65 ⫾ 1.64 ms in acsf, 80.12 ⫾ 9.02 ms in flu; p ⬍ 0.05,
wsrt). in  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats, the effects were more complicated. biexponentials were required to fit the sipsc decay in
acsf (␶fast, 8.02 ⫾ 1.88 ms contributing to 70.75 ⫾ 13.79% and
␶slow, 16.22 ⫾ 1.94 ms), but, in flunitrazepam, biexponential fits
gave very similar fast and slow time constants (␶fast, 24.81 ⫾ 2.41
ms contributing to 48.64 ⫾ 5.64% and ␶slow, 25.9 ⫾ 14.39 ms).
indeed, a single exponential of 22.21 ⫾ 2.41 ms was sufficient to
describe the decay under these conditions. nonetheless, analysis
of the effects of flunitrazepam on ␶fast in  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats
showed a significant difference on this earliest phase of decay
(␶fast, 8.02 ⫾ 1.88 ms in acsf, 24.81 ⫾ 2.41 ms in flu; p ⬍ 0.05,
t test). such genotype-dependent differences in the effect of flunitrazepam on the early phases of sipsc decays indicate that ␣6
subunit-containing gabars are located within the synaptic cleft.
tonic inhibition is sensitive to benzodiazepines in animals
expressing the ␣6(r100q) polymorphism
tonic inhibition of cgcs in slice preparations is primarily mediated by gabars composed of ␣6, ␤2/3, and ␦ subunits (brickley et al., 2001b; stell et al., 2003; hanchar et al., 2005), a composition thought to be benzodiazepine insensitive. a study of
cultured cgcs seems to challenge this view by reporting that
flunitrazepam enhances tonic inhibition (leao et al., 2000). this
discrepancy could be explained in two ways: (1) in culture preparations, tonic inhibition may arise from ␣1/␥2 subunitcontaining as well as ␣6/␦ subunit-containing gabars, or (2)
gabars composed of ␣6, ␤2/3, and ␦ subunits may be benzodiazepine sensitive under certain conditions. considering the prevalence of the  xxxg835xxx  100q allele in sprague dawley rats (hanchar
et al., 2005) that were the animals used to prepare cultures in the
study by leao et al. (2000), we examined whether tonic currents
in cgcs of  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats are benzodiazepine sensitive.
in the absence of benzodiazepines, the magnitude of tonic

there is concern that prolonged sipsc
decays might mask as tonic current in
 xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats, an effect that would
allow synaptic gabars to contribute to
steady-state current. to address this, we
performed two additional analyses and an
additional experiment. first, we calculated
the changes in the amplitude and variance
of baseline current caused by flunitrazepam using an alternative method to minimize the contribution of ipsc decay (see
materials and methods). this analysis also
showed a significant enhancement of tonic
gaba currents (10.37 ⫾ 2.4 pa in acsf

␣6(r100q)␤3␥2 and at 100 nm gaba in both ␣6␤3␦ and
␣6(100q)␤3␦ receptors (fig. 5c).
such subunit-specific and [gaba]-dependent benzodiazepine effects place constraints on which gabar subtypes contribute to tonic currents in our slice experiments. previous estimates of ambient [gaba] range from tens of nanomolar to a few
micromolar (farrant and nusser, 2005). comparison of figures
4 and 5 illustrates that, at ⬍1 ␮m gaba, only flunitrazepam
enhancement of ␦ subunit-containing but not ␥2 subunitcontaining gabars can explain the ⬎70% increase of tonic currents in  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats.
to rule out confounding influences that might occur if the
polymorphism caused large changes in flunitrazepam dose
dependency, we measured flunitrazepam dose–response relationships using the [gaba] that yielded maximal enhancement by 1 ␮m flunitrazepam (i.e., 10 ␮m gaba for ␥2 subunitcontaining and 100 nm gaba for ␦ subunit-containing

solid line) between the control tonic current amplitude and the
fold increase expected during application of 300 nm gaba. nonlinear regression analysis showed that the simulated curve fit the
experimental data with r 2 ⫽ 0.787. based on the range of tonic
currents in slices under control conditions (⬃3–25 pa), the theoretical relationship predicts that the resting [gaba] is in the

[gaba] of 164 nm (fig. 6c, dotted lines) corresponding to the

2 for the gabars underlying the tonic current. based on the average tonic current in acsf of
11.75 pa, the theoretical curve predicts that an average gaba concentration of 164 nm is responsible for the tonic current in these cells.

measurements of tonic gaba current suggest that [gaba] is
⬃160 nm
the brain slice data and tight concentration range over which ␦
subunit-containing gabars show flunitrazepam sensitivity imply a resting [gaba] of ⬃100 nm. we directly probed the range
of resting [gaba] responsible for tonic currents in slices from
 xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats by bath application of 300 nm gaba, a concentration well below the 700 nm ec50 for ␣6(100q)␤2/3␦ receptors (hanchar et al., 2005). in every cgc tested (n ⫽ 9) (fig. 6 a),
300 nm gaba increased tonic current, indicating that the resting
[gaba] surrounding these cells is below 300 nm. mean tonic
gaba current increased approximately threefold from 11.75 ⫾
2.4 to 35.08 ⫾ 3.7 pa ( p ⬍ 0.001, t test) (fig. 6 b). however,
considerable variability in the amount of increase was evident
between cells. plotting the fold increase against the size of the
tonic current before application of 300 nm gaba showed a clear
decrease in the degree of enhancement in cgcs with larger tonic
currents (fig. 6c). this is consistent with the idea that variability
in resting [gaba] accounts for the different levels of tonic currents. we tested this idea in a model with two simple assumptions: all cgcs have the same maximal tonic current, and this
current has an ec50 of 700 nm and a hill coefficient of 2 (for
details, see materials and methods). using the hill equation, the

contributions of ␣6 subunits to synaptic inhibition
immunocytochemistry and biochemistry have provided complementary evidence that ␣6 subunits partner with ␤2/3 and ␥2
subunits to form gabars at inhibitory synapses on cgcs (jechlinger et al., 1998; nusser et al., 1998). moreover, functional
properties of ␣6 and ␥2 subunit-containing gabars seem ideally suited to detect the high concentration gaba transients that
occur within the synaptic cleft (saxena and macdonald, 1996).
several studies have attempted to test whether ␣6 subunits contribute to sipscs using furosemide, an antagonist of ␣6 subunitcontaining receptors (korpi et al., 1995). however, these studies
have reached different conclusions regarding the contribution of
␣6 subunits to fast inhibition (tia et al., 1996; rossi and hamann, 1998; wall, 2003). in principle, genetic deletion of ␣6
offers another way to examine its contributions to synaptic
gabars. although ␣6 ⫺/⫺ animals exist, the expression of other
synaptic subunits (␣1 and ␥2) is altered (jones et al., 1997; nusser
et al., 1999), making it difficult to interpret changes in synaptic
currents. our approach takes advantage of a more subtle tool, a
single nucleotide polymorphism that alters gabar pharmacology in  xxxg220xxx -specific way without changing expression
(korpi et al., 1993) or gaba affinity (hanchar et al., 2005). we
recognize that a potential limitation of this approach is that our
results do not distinguish between ␣6␤2/3␥2 and ␣1␣6␤2/3␥2
combinations detected by poltl et al. (2003) in immunoprecipitation studies. additionally, it is also possible that an increase in
perisynaptic localization of ␣6(100q) subunit-containing receptors or an increase in the proportion of ␣1␣6(100q)␤2/3␥2 receptors might contribute to the prolonged sipsc decay in cgcs
from gabra 100q/100q rats. however, the effects of flunitrazepam
on the earliest phases of the sipsc decay demonstrate unambiguously that a large proportion of gabars within the synaptic
cleft must contain ␣6 subunits.
benzodiazepine modulation of ␣6 and ␦
subunit-containing gabars
this study provides direct evidence that recombinant gabars
composed of ␣6(100q) and ␦ subunits can be modulated by
benzodiazepines in a narrow range of gaba concentrations that
are physiologically relevant for extrasynaptic inhibition. the
gaba concentration dependence of benzodiazepine modulation
might account for the discrepancy between the present results
and previous studies, which did not find benzodiazepine effects
on ␦ subunit-containing gabars (saxena and macdonald,
1996). our findings challenge the generally accepted views that a
␥ subunit is required for, and that ␣6 prevents, benzodiazepine
modulation of gaba receptors (hevers and luddens, 1998). our
data suggest that in situ modulation of ␣6 and ␦ subunitcontaining gabars could occur under conditions in which
[gaba] is low. because these are tonic currents, such modula-

tion would be expected to result in large increases in charge transfer and profound effects on the excitability of cgcs. the effects
would be most pronounced in animals carrying the
benzodiazepine-sensitive allele of the ␣6 subunit. the abundance
of this allele in rats (hanchar et al., 2005) could explain variability
in previous reports regarding the sensitivity of tonic inhibition in
cgcs to benzodiazepines (leao et al., 2000; hamann et al., 2002;
wall, 2005).
an empirical estimate of the free gaba in brain slices
in our examination of recombinant gabars, we observed a
marked gaba concentration dependence for benzodiazepine
modulation, and the concentration ranges yielding maximal enhancement were dependent on subunit composition. the gaba
concentration dependence correlated with the relative affinities
of ␥2 and ␦ subunit-containing gabars for gaba: ec50 values
for ␣6/␦ subunit-containing gabars are ⬃500 –700 nm,
whereas for ␣6/␥2 subunit-containing gabars, they are 2–20
␮m (hanchar et al., 2005). this correlation between gaba affinity and benzodiazepine modulation is consistent with proposed
mechanisms of benzodiazepine action in which the modulators
increase the effective affinity of gaba (perrais and ropert, 1999).
at higher steady-state gaba concentrations, benzodiazepines
become less effective because the binding sites are fully occupied
by gaba.
this behavior proved to be a useful indicator of the ambient
gaba concentration underlying the tonic current. flunitrazepam enhanced responses at 100 nm gaba mediated by recombinant ␣6(100r)␤3␦ and ␣6(100q)␤3␦ receptors to the same
extent as the tonic current was enhanced in cgcs of  xxxg835xxx  100r/100r
and  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats. to see comparable increases for recombinant ␣6␤3␥2 receptors, it was necessary to have gaba
concentration ⬎1 ␮m. a separate line of experiments on slices
from  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats showed that the [gaba] generating
tonic currents are much lower than 300 nm. moreover, the degree
to which 300 nm gaba was able to enhance tonic current in each
cell could be predicted with surprising accuracy based on the level
of tonic current in control. the simplest interpretation of the
recombinant and native data are that tonic currents in perfused
brain slices are generated by gaba concentrations of ⬃150 nm
acting on gabars composed of the subunits ␣6(100r) or
␣6(100q) and ␦. because of the continual perfusion of the slice
during experiments, we consider it likely that this is an underestimate of the resting [gaba] in vivo; indeed, recent recordings of
cgcs in anesthetized rats indicate considerably larger tonic currents (chadderton et al., 2004). our interpretation that ␦
subunit-containing gabars are responsible for tonic current is
also consistent with recently reported findings that cgcs in ␦
subunit knock-out mice lack tonic current (stell et al., 2003).
in summary, enhanced benzodiazepine modulation of both
phasic and tonic inhibition in the cerebellum likely accounts for
the greater motor impairment in response to benzodiazepines
seen in rat lines expressing the ␣6(r100q) subunit mutation
(korpi et al., 1993). small changes in tonic current are known to
have profound effects on the excitability of granule cells (hamann et al., 2002; mitchell and silver, 2003; chadderton et al.,
2004). the hypersensitivity of the  xxxg835xxx  100q/100q rats to benzodiazepines highlights the marked behavioral effects that can result when both synaptic and extrasynaptic gabars are modulated under physiological conditions.
