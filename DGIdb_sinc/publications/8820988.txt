contraceptive treatment increases
the affinity of uterine  xxxg730xxx  in adult rat
perinatal gestagen treatment changes the reaction

uterus  xxxg730xxx  affinity increases in adult rats if

treated with contraceptive, without receptor density change.
uterus  xxxg730xxx  density decreases in adulthood following  xxxd117xxx  ( xxxd117xxx ) treatment perinatally with receptor
affinity unchanging. in perinatally  xxxd117xxx  treated rats contraceptive treatment resulted in the decrease of receptor affinity

and increase of density, related to the only perinatally  xxxd117xxx  treated animals. the results draw attention to the fact
that contraceptives may influence the  xxxg730xxx  state of
the uterus and the pregnancy maintaining treatment (by  xxxd117xxx ) may influence the state of uterine estrogen receptors

are still present in adulthood (csaba, inczefi-gonda and dobozy
1986). the most common example of this are the haemopoietic
cells (malini, strocki, marata and ambrosini 1984; csaba and

inczefi-gonda 1990).

treatment of female rats with the components of contraceptive
pills ( xxxd2754xxx  and  xxxd2054xxx ) accounted for about 30

percent decrease (after 8 days) in the binding capacity of
thymic cells for glucocorticoids (csaba, lnczefi-gonda,

— hormonal imprinting — gestagen

szeberényi and dobozy 1992) as a result of an overlap on the
still plastic receptors of the developing thymus cells. this experimental observation supported the hypothesis that a receptor level effect (faulty imprinting) of the contraceptive hormone preparation could also influence the uterine cells, since
these cells are also continuously regenerating.

introduction

the present experiments were performed to substantiate this
hypothesis.

the hormone receptors of mammals are immature in the per-

margolis, tanner, seminara and taylor 1990) and mature only

two series of experiments were performed:

in the presence of the adequate hormone (csaba 1980). hormonal imprinting (csaba 1980) that takes place at primary interaction of target cells with the adequate hormone accounts
for receptor maturation (csaba 1981; 1984; 1986; 1994) and
the binding capacity of receptors as well as the response of the
cell become characteristic to that of the receptor-hormone reaction at the adult age. when an inadequate molecule which
is nevertheless able to bind to the  xxxg1603xxx  meets the

contraception and gestagen effects on estrogen receptors

animals were killed by decapitation. all procedures were per-

formed in vessels immersed in ice/water. uteri were cut into
pieces and homogenized in a tight fitting glass-teflon potter
homogenizer (2 x 8 strokes) with 1.5 ml/g wet wt. 10mm irishclbuffer(ph 7.4) containing 1.5mm edta and 20mm molyb-

date freshly supplemented with 2mm dithiotreitol. homogenates were centrifuged at 100.000g for 60 minutes and the supernatants were used for receptor assays. protein concentration was determined by the coomassie-blue method (spector
1978).

saturation analysis with 3h-est radio!
concentrations of 2,4,6,7-3h-estradiol (3.4
tbq/mmole spec activity, izinta, budapest): 0.312; 0.625;
1.25; 2.5; 5; 10; 20 nm were incubated with rat uteri cytosol
(300ug protein) in a total volume of 0.1 ml at o'c for 18 hours
for total binding. to estimate nonspecific binding there was
another set of tubes containing 100 fold excess of unlabelled
estradiol (organon) for each concentration. all assays were
performed in duplicate. equilibrium binding was terminated
by the dextran-coated charcoal method, and bound and free

since there was a long period (22 days) between the end of the

one week contraceptive treatment and the measurement this
calls attention to the prolonged receptorial effect of adult contraceptive treatment in the uterus. however, in general, receptor density changes used to follow perinatal hormonal imprinting. in the present case the change in affinity shows that the
subchronic treatment in adult age provoked a different reaction.

we have found previously that perinatal  xxxd117xxx  treatment decreased the uterus  xxxg730xxx  density in adults,
without changing their affinity (csaba, inczefi-gonda and
dobozy 1986). our present experiment confirms this result
(table 1 and fig. 1, groups i and 2). in addition the results of
the experiment deserves attention on the fact that animals

since hormonal imprinting is not only age but development
dependent phenomenon endometrium seemed to be sensitive
to imprinting like cytogenic organs (csaba and inczefi-gonda
1989; 1990) or dedifferentiated cells during liver regeneration
(csaba inczefi-gonda and dobozy 1989).

uterus  xxxg730xxx  affinity increased significantly in rats

treated with a contraceptive in adulthood, with their binding
capacity unchanged (table i and fig.1, groups 1, 3; fig.2).

contraceptive treatment from controls, in adult age, with
decreasing affinity and increasing density related to the solely
 xxxd117xxx  treated animals (table 1 and fig. 1, groups 2 and
4).

the results of our present experiment show that:
1. contraceptive treatment may induce hormonal imprinting
on adult uterus receptors: the affinity of estrogen receptors
increases.

2. treatment with  xxxd117xxx  — a gestagen, frequently used
for saving endangered pregnancies — perinatally, decreases
the number of uterus estrogen receptors of adults.
3. treatment with contraceptives in adults results in different

alteration in  xxxg730xxx 's binding properties from
those treated with  xxxd117xxx  perinatally.
there were many pregnant women treated with  xxxd117xxx 
(e.g. with  xxxd117xxx -organon). projecting the results of the pre-

sent experiments to human beings the disparate reaction to

contraceptives of women fetally treated with  xxxd117xxx 
could be surmized. this has to be considered in medically indicated contraceptive treatments.
