summary. the effects of 3-week treatment with a typical antipsychotic
drug chlorpromazine and three atypical antipsychotic drugs (risperidone,
olanzapine and perospirone) on the binding to dopamine d2 and serotonin 5ht2a receptors were examined in the rat stratum and frontal cortex, respectively. subchronic treatment with chlorpromazine (10 mg/kg) and perospirone
(1 mg/kg) significantly increased d2 receptors, while no increase was observed
with lower dose of chlorpromazine (5 mg/kg), perospirone (0.1 mg/kg),
risperidone (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg) or olanzapine (1, 2 mg/kg). on the other hand, 3week administration of chlorpromazine (5, 10 mg/kg) and olanzapine (1, 2 mg/
kg) significantly decreased 5-ht2a receptors, but risperidone (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg)
or perospirone (0.1, 1 mg/kg) had no effect. the measurement of in vivo
drug occupation for d2 and 5-ht2a receptors using n-ethoxycarbonyl-2ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (eedq) suggested that high occupation of 5ht2a receptors with lower  xxxg656xxx  occupancy might be involved in the
absence of up-regulation of d2 receptors after subchronic treatment with
some atypical antipsychotic drugs.

introduction

serotonin 5-ht2a receptors are considered to be important in the therapeutical action of clozapine and other putative atypical antipsychotic drugs. a
certain group of atypical antipsychotic drugs were characterized by high affinity for 5-ht2a receptors with lower or minimal affinity for dopamine d2
receptors in vitro and in vivo (meltzer et al., 1989; matsubara et al., 1993;
takahashi et al., 1998a,b). these characteristics may be relevant to their weak

liability to induce extrapyramidal side effects or tardive dyskinesia, and possible efficacy for the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia
(kapur and remington, 1996). it has been indicated that subchronic administration of typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol induces the up-regulation
of striatal d2 receptors, whereas that of atypical antipsychotics such as
clozapine does not have such an effect (rupniak et al., 1985; wilmot and
szczepanik, 1989; o’dell et al., 1990). we have previously shown that coadministration of  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist attenuated the up-regulation of
d2 receptors induced by subchronic treatment with haloperidol so long as the
in vivo occupation of 5-ht2a receptors is higher than that of d2 receptors
(ishikane et al., 1997).
in this study, the effects of 3-week treatment with various 5-ht2/ xxxg656xxx  antagonists including both typical and atypical antipsychotics on the
binding to d2 and 5-ht2a receptors were examined in the rat striatum and
frontal cortex, respectively. we also measured in vivo occupation of d2 and
5-ht2a receptors after the administration of these drugs using nethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (eedq).
methods
male wistar rats (120–160 g, 6 week-old) supplied from japan slc inc. (shizuoka, japan)
were used for all experiments. for subchronic administration experiments, the test compound (chlorpromazine 5, 10 mg/kg, perospirone 0.1, 1 mg/kg, risperidone 0.25, 0.5 mg/kg
and olanzapine 1, 2 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.15% tartaric acid) was administrated intraperitoneally to the rats once a day for 3 weeks. after a complete wash-out period for one week,
the rats were sacrificed by decapitation. the doses of test compounds were chosen as
corresponding to the clinical dosage. for in vivo receptor occupancy measurements, the
rats received the test compound or vehicle intraperitoneally 1 hour before eedq (8 mg/
kg; dissolved in water/ethanol, 1 : 1, v/v; 4 mg/ml) injection. twenty-four hours after
eedq injection, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation. the dissected cerebral cortices
and striata were frozen on dry ice and stored at 270°c until they were used.
the tissue membranes were prepared, and saturation and in vivo occupancy experiments were performed according to the method of matsubara et al. (1993) and ishikane
et al. (1997). the d2 and 5-ht2a receptors were labeled with [3h]spiperone (19.1 ci/
mmol) and [3h] xxxd2419xxx  (60.0 ci/mmol), respectively. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 µm (1)butaclamol (for d2) or 2 µm  xxxd2621xxx  (for 5-ht2a
receptor binding). six concentrations of [3h]spiperone (0.01–0.32 nm) and [3h] xxxd2419xxx 
(0.1–3.2 nm) were used for saturation experiments. the dissociation constant (kd) and the
total number of binding sites (bmax) were estimated using the non-linear regression
program ebda/ligand.
receptor occupation was estimated by measuring the radioactivity that had escaped
eedq-induced reduction, and was calculated by the following equation: percent receptor occupation (%) 5 {(drug/eedq) 2 (eedq)}/{(drug)-(eedq)} 3 100 (matsubara et
al., 1993). statistical comparisons were made by analysis of variance followed by a
duncan new multiple range test.

results

three-week treatment with chlorpromazine (10 mg/kg) and perospirone
(1 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of d2 receptors in the striatum
compared to vehicle, while no increase was observed by that with lower dose
of chlorpromazine (5 mg/kg), perospirone (0.1 mg/kg), risperidone (0.25,
0.5 mg/kg) or olanzapine (1, 2 mg/kg) (table 1). on the other hand, subchronic

the in vivo drug occupation for d2 and 5-ht2a receptors after acute
administration were shown in table 3. treatments with low dose of
perospirone (0.1 mg/kg), risperidone (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg) and olanzapine (1, 2 mg/
kg) showed higher occupation of 5-ht2a receptors than that of d2 receptors.
on the other hand, administration of chlorpromazine (5, 10 mg/kg) and higher
dose of perospirone (1 mg/kg) exhibited almost same occupancy of 5-ht2a
and d2 receptors.
discussion

the present results suggest that high occupation of 5-ht2a receptors in vivo
with lower occupation of d2 receptors may be involved in the absense of upregulation of d2 receptors after subchronic treatment with some atypical
antipsychotic drugs. this finding is in accordance with our earlier report
of combined treatment with a  xxxg656xxx  antagonist haloperidol and a 5ht2a/2c receptor antagonist ritanserin (ishikane et al., 1997). when both d2
and 5-ht2a receptors were highly occupied (i.e. more than 60%) as treatment
with 10 mg/kg of chlorpromazine or 1 mg/kg of perospirone, d2 receptors were
up-regulated after subchronic treatment. however, the administration of
5 mg/kg chlorpromazine, which occupied about 40% of both d2 and 5-ht2a
receptors, did not induce  xxxg656xxx  up-regulation. it is possible that striatal
d2 receptors may be up-regulated only when  xxxg656xxx  occupancy is high
(i.e. more than 60%) independent of cortical  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy. but
this possibility is incompatible with our previous result that the occupations of
d2 receptors are 44.3% and 68.0% by 0.1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg of haloperidol,
respectively, both of which induce  xxxg656xxx  up-regulation. we have previously shown that subchronic administration of clozapine (10 mg/kg) or org
5222 (0.25 mg/kg) had no effect on striatal d2 receptors. in vivo occupancy of

d2 and 5-ht2a receptors were 10.9% and 50.5% for 10 mg/kg of clozapine,
and 43.8% and 83.7% for 0.25 mg/kg of org 5222, respectively (ishikane et
al., 1997). therefore, these findings suggest that higher in vivo occupation of
5-ht2a receptors than that of d2 receptors may contribute to their unique
properties of some atypical antipsychotics. moreover, in this study, we examined the effect of dose of various drugs on  xxxg656xxx  up-regulation. the
dose of each antipsychotic agent indeed influenced the occupancy of both d2
and 5-ht2a receptors as shown in table 3. thus, whether subchronic treatment with the antipsychotic agent induces  xxxg656xxx  up-regulation may
depend on not only what the drug is, but the dose of the drug. these results
suggest that the setting of clinical dose of a 5-ht2/ xxxg656xxx  antagonist may
be very important for atypical antipsychotic actions.
the precise mechanism by which  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism may
attenuate the  xxxg656xxx  up-regulation is uncertain from the present
data. one possible examination may be that  xxxg1113xxx  blockade
affects raphe neurons which then influence neural dopamine function. it
was reported that lesion of the dorsal raphe nucleus resulted in increased
dopamine metabolites in the substantia nigra, suggesting a tonically active
inhibition of dopamine neurons from dorsal raphe (dray et al., 1976; nicolaou
et al., 1979). similarly, acute 5-ht2a antagonist treatment enhanced the
activity of nigrostriatal dopamine-containing neurons (ugedo et al., 1989),
presumably resulting in enhanced dopamine release and receptor stimulation
(saller et al., 1990). dopamine agonist administration was reported to attenuate haloperidol-induced  xxxg656xxx  supersensitivity (list and seeman,
1979).
on the other hand, it is not known from our data why risperidone and
perospirone which are potent  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists both in vitro and in
vivo, do not induce  xxxg1113xxx  down-regulation in the frontal cortex.
only in vivo occupancy of d2 and 5-ht2a receptors cannot explain these
mechanisms. moreover, it does not appear that extracellular 5-ht level
is directly related to the  xxxg1113xxx  down-regulation. ichikawa et al.
(1998) have reported that risperidone (1 mg/kg) and clozapine (20 mg/kg)
significantly increased extracellular 5-ht concentrations in the rat medial
frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens but that olanzapine (1 and 10 mg/kg),
mdl-100,907 (1 mg/kg), a selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist, or haloperidol (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) had no significant effect in either region. hertel et al.
(1997) also indicated that risperidone (0.2, 0.6 and 2 mg/kg) dose-dependently
increased extracellular 5-ht levels in the rat frontal cortex, which may be
related to its  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonistic action. matsubara et al. (1989)
reported the down-regulation of 5-ht2 receptors following a single injection
of clozapine (20 mg/kg). however, this rapid down-regulation of  xxxg1113xxx  sites is characteristic of some but not all atypical antipsychotic drugs. they
have concluded that dibenzo-epines such as clozapine,  xxxd2511xxx ,  xxxd160xxx 
and chlothiapine consistantly down-regulated 5-ht2 receptors in frontal cortex after acute treatment. kuoppamaeki et al. (1995) reported no change of 5ht2a receptors after 2-week treatment with risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) and also
pointed the possibility that administration of structurally different 5-ht2a

300

i. kusumi et al.

antagonists could lead to various  xxxg1113xxx  adaptation other than
down-regulation.
in this study, 3-week intraperitoneal injection of perospirone (0.1 and
1 mg/kg) did not induce  xxxg1113xxx  down-regulation in the rat frontal
cortex. however, ohno et al. (1995) indicated that 2-week oral administration
of perospirone (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the density of 5-ht2a receptors in the same region. in our study, the animals were decapitated one week
after the last injection, while the withdrawal of oral treatment was 72 hr in the
study of ohno et al. it has been shown that the  xxxg1113xxx  downregulation is reversed faster after stopping drug treatment than  xxxg656xxx 
up-regulation (leysen et al., 1986). thus, the possibility exists that differences
in the treatment protocol or the pharmacokinetics of the test compounds
may explain the different results. moreover, ritanserin has been recently
reported to be more effective in lowering  xxxg1113xxx  numbers when coadministered with haloperidol than when administered alone (szczepanik and
wilmot, 1997). this finding suggests a possibility of interaction between d2
and  xxxg1113xxx  populations. the mechanisms of  xxxg1113xxx  downregulation are not known from the present study, thus further investigations
are needed to elucidate the  xxxg1113xxx  adaptation after subchronic
administration of 5-ht2a antagonists.
in conclusion, our study indicates that high in vivo occupation of 5-ht2a
receptors with lower occupation of d2 receptors may underlie the absence of
striatal  xxxg656xxx  up-regulation after the subchronic treatment with some
atypical neuroleptics. these characteristics may be relevant to the atypicality
for at least a certain group of atypical antipsychotic drugs. some atypical
antipsychotics have high affinity not only for d2 and/or 5-ht2a receptors, but
also for d3, d4,  xxxg1112xxx  and 5ht7 receptors (sokoloff et al., 1990; van tol et al.,
1991; roth et al., 1994). therefore, in future, we should also investigate the
interactions between these receptors in order to develop new therapeutic
approaches to the treatment of schizophrenia and drug-related side effects.
