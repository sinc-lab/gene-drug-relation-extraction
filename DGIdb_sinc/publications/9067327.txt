barbiturate-like actions of the propanediol dicarbamates  xxxd2090xxx  and meprobamate.   xxxd2090xxx  and meprobamate are structurally related propanediol dicarbamates that possess distinct pharmacological profiles.  xxxd2090xxx  is a minimally sedative, broad-spectrum anticonvulsant, whereas meprobamate is a strong sedative-anxiolytic agent. previously, we reported that  xxxd2090xxx  potentiates gamma- xxxd2177xxx (a) (gaba(a)) receptor cl- currents and inhibits n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor currents. here we further characterized the interaction of the two dicarbamates with gaba(a) receptors to determine the basis for their pharmacological differences. in whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from cultured rat hippocampal neurons, meprobamate enhanced gaba-evoked responses in a concentration-dependent manner and, at high concentrations (>1 mm), exhibited a separate channel-blocking effect that limited the magnitude of gaba(a) receptor potentiation. at equivalent concentrations, meprobamate produced substantially greater potentiation than did  xxxd2090xxx . furthermore, meprobamate (but not  xxxd2090xxx ), in the absence of gaba, directly activated cl- currents that could be attenuated by the gaba(a) receptor antagonists bicuculline and  xxxd2947xxx . the mean deactivation time constant of whole-cell currents evoked by 10 mm meprobamate (110 ms) or 1 and 3 microm gaba (180 ms) were faster than the deactivation time constant of 10 mm meprobamate (490 ms) or 3 mm  xxxd2090xxx  (470 ms) in the presence of gaba. meprobamate and  xxxd2090xxx  prolonged the mean burst duration of gaba-activated unitary currents in excised outside-out membrane patches. in addition, at high (supratherapeutic) concentrations, meprobamate blocked nmda-activated currents. we conclude that  xxxd2090xxx  and meprobamate have barbiturate-like modulatory actions on gaba(a) receptors, but meprobamate has greater activity and, unlike  xxxd2090xxx , is able to directly activate the receptor.
