abstract
lidoflazine is an antianginal calcium channel blocker that carries a significant risk of qt interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia.
we investigated whether or not lidoflazine inhibits current through the rapid delayed rectifier k+ channel  xxxg220xxx  (encoded by herg –
human ether-a-go-go-related gene), since this channel has been widely linked to drug-induced qt-prolongation. lidoflazine inhibited
potently herg current (iherg) recorded from hek 293 cells stably expressing wild-type herg (ic50 of ~16 nm). it was ~13-fold more
potent against herg than was verapamil under similar conditions. on membrane depolarization, iherg inhibition developed gradually, ruling
out closed-channel state dependent inhibition. the effect of command voltage on the drug’s action suggested that lidoflazine preferentially
inhibits activated/open herg channels. the s6 mutation y652a largely eliminated the inhibitory action of lidoflazine, whilst the f656a
mutation also reduced blocking potency. we conclude: first, that lidoflazine produces high affinity blockade of the  xxxg220xxx  of the herg
channel by binding to aromatic amino acid residues within the channel pore and, second, that this is likely to represent the molecular
mechanism of qt interval prolongation by this drug.

1. introduction
lidoflazine (lfz) is a diphenylalkylamine calcium channel blocker (figure 1a), developed primarily as a treatment
for angina pectoris. however, lfz has been associated with
qt prolongation [1-3] and carries a risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias [1,3-5]. pharmacological prolongation of the
qt interval is often associated with inhibition of the rapid
delayed rectifier potassium current (ikr), which participates
in ventricular repolarization and hence influences action potential duration [6,7]. the human ether-a-go-go-related gene
(herg) [6,8] encodes the major pore-forming subunit of ikr,
which can interact with a range of structurally diverse drugs
[9]. this pharmacological promiscuity has been attributed to
a large channel inner cavity and to an unusually high number
of aromatic residues within the pore region [10]. a number of

structurally distinct ca2+ channel blockers have been reported to inhibit heterologously-expressed herg k+ channels [11-14], but there are no published data on the effect of
lfz on herg. accordingly, the aims of this study were (i)
to determine whether or not lfz inhibits herg current
(iherg), and if so, (ii) to examine the potency of lfz and (iii)
to investigate the mechanism of blockade.
2. materials and methods
2.1. electrophysiological recording from herg-expressing
cell lines
whole cell measurements of wild-type (wt) iherg were
made at 37 ± 1 °c as described previously [15] from hek
293 cells stably expressing herg (generously donated by
dr craig january, university of wisconsin) or from another
cell line stably expressing lower levels of herg developed
in this laboratory [15]. hek 293 cells stably expressing the
s6 mutants y652a and f656a were also employed [15].

(d) concentration-response relationships for inhibition of iherg tails by lfz and verapamil. the data were fitted with a hill equation (smooth curves).

data were acquired and analysed as described previously
[15,16]. normal tyrode’s solution contained (mm):
140 nacl, 4 kcl, 2.5 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, 10 glucose, 5 hepes,
(ph of 7.45). for experiments employing the s6 mutant
f656a, the external solution contained 94 mm kcl (the
nacl concentration was correspondingly reduced). the
patch pipette solution contained (mm): 130 kcl, 1 mgcl2,
5 egta, 5 mgatp, 10 hepes (ph of 7.2).
2.2. drugs
lfz (research diagnostics, nj) was dissolved in methanol to produce a stock solution of 25 mm, this was serially
diluted to produce stock solutions ranging from 1 mm to
250 nm. final concentrations of lfz were produced by
1:1000 dilutions of stock to tyrode’s solution to achieve the
required concentrations. the ph of lfz-tyrode’s solutions
was 7.45. experimental superfusate was exchanged within
1 s. verapamil (sigma aldrich) was dissolved in deionized
water to produce an initial stock solution of 10 mm and final
concentrations were produced as described for lfz.
2.3. data analysis
data are presented as mean ± sem, except for values
derived from fits to concentration-response data; here 95 %
confidence intervals (c.i.) are given. statistical comparisons
were made using either an unpaired t-test or one way analysis
of variance (anova) with a bonferroni post-test (instat,
graphpad inc.). p values of less than 0.05 were taken as

significant. the equations used for numerical analysis and
graphical fits to data-sets have been described previously
[15,16].
2.4. correction of concentration-response data for
run-down of iherg amplitude
lfz produced progressive rather than rapid development
of iherg blockade, reaching a steady-state over ~ 10 min
(figure 1b). experiments were therefore performed in order
to correct the concentration-response data for current rundown over this time-period. the mean level of run-down of
iherg tails at –40 mv following pulses to +20 mv over
10 minutes was 10.6 ± 2.4 % of the peak outward tail current
(n = 5). control iherg tail amplitude was corrected accordingly when calculating fractional block (figure 1d). correction for iherg run-down during concentration-response experiments (which employed a protocol to a single test
potential value) was uncomplicated. however, in order to
avoid possible correction errors during the voltage-protocols
employed in figure 2, isochronal current measurements
were made (after 3 min of exposure to lfz). data in figure 3
represent time-matched (10 min) measurements from wt
and mutant channels, using a drug concentration producing
profound block of wt herg over this time-period.
3. results and discussion
figure 1b shows that lfz progressively inhibited iherg
over 10 min of drug exposure. this decrease was much

greater than that attributable to current run-down (figure
1c). the relation between iherg block and drug concentration between 250 pm and 1 µm was plotted (figure 1d; a

minimum of 5 cells for each concentration) and revealed an
ic50 of 16.6 nm (95 % c.i. = 14.4 to 19.1 nm) and a hill
slope close to 1. in order to place this finding in context,

similar measurements were made for verapamil, a phenylalkylamine calcium channel blocker that is known to block
herg [11-13]. verapamil inhibited iherg with an ic50 of
215.4 nm (95 % c.i. = 161.2 to 287.8 nm) compared to
published values of 143 nm - 830 nm for iherg from mammalian cell lines [11-13]. lfz blockade was relieved slowly
and incompletely upon removal of lfz (data not shown).
to investigate the mechanism of lfz blockade, we measured the development of iherg inhibition during a 10 s
depolarizing step to 0 mv (lower trace, figure 2a). this
protocol was applied to cells in control solution, was discontinued during 3 min exposure to 250 nm lfz, and was then
reapplied (upper traces, figure 2a). figure 2b shows mean
fractional block (n = 5 cells) measured at different timepoints (0.2 s, 0.5 s, 2.5 s, 5.0 s and 10.0 s) during the first
depolarization step to 0 mv after the rest period in lfz.
currents in control and drug were initially similar in amplitude (no significant fractional block at 0.2s following depolarization) with blockade then progressively developing during the maintained depolarization in the presence of lfz.
the lack of significant blockade early (0.2 s) following depolarization suggests that lfz did not block the herg channels in the closed channel state(s), and indicates a contingency of blockade on channel gating. progressive onset of
blockade during the course of a long depolarizing step has
been observed previously for other drugs including verapamil and the high affinity methanesulfonanilides (e.g.
[11,17]).
in order to assess the influence of membrane voltage on
the channel-blocking action of lfz, time-matched measurements were made during 10 s depolarizations to -20 mv,
0 mv and +40 mv. iherg blockade at 0 mv was significantly
greater than that at –20 mv (figure 2c, measurements taken
at 5 s into the 10 s depolarization). the fractional blockade at
0 mv was also larger than at +40 mv (although this trend did
not attain statistical significance); possibly, this could reflect
a greater affinity of the drug for activated than inactivated
channels. accordingly, we used a three step protocol (figure
2d, lower trace) to examine the effect of increasing iherg
inactivation on the degree of lfz blockade. this protocol
incorporated a 4 s duration step to +80 mv superimposed on
the step to 0 mv, in order to promote the transition of the
channels into the inactivated state [15,16]. the protocol was
applied before lfz exposure and after 3 min exposure to
drug in the absence of pulsing (figure 2d). figure 2e shows
a plot of fractional block against time for the cell in figure
2d. a small step-decrease in block occurred on transition
from 0 mv to +80 mv, with blockade then continuing to
develop during the maintained phase at +80 mv. on return to
0 mv, there was a small step increase in block compared to
+80 mv (similar observations in 5 cells). considered collectively, the observations in figure 2 indicate that iherg gating
is necessary for lfz blockade to develop and that, while the
affinity of the drug may be slightly higher for activated than
inactivated channels, promoting inactivation did not relieve
block greatly.

the progressive development of blockade of iherg by
lfz over time (figure 1b) is consistent with the drug gaining
access to the interior mouth of the channel following diffusion across the cell membrane. two aromatic amino-acid
residues in the s6 region of the herg channel (y652 and
f656) have been implicated as consensus determinants of
high affinity channel blockade, by p-stacking with aromatic
moieties in drug molecules that access the channel pore from
the cell interior [10,18-20]. since lfz possesses multiple
aromatic rings (figure 1a), we examined the effect of the
mutations y652a (tyrosine to alanine) and f656a (phenylalanine to alanine) on the blocking action of lfz. figure 3a
compares effects of 250 nm lfz on wt-herg (ai) and
y652a (aii; mean data aiii). blockade of wt-herg was
nearly complete, whilst blockade of current from cells with
y652a was only ~30%. figure 3b compares block of wtherg (bi) and f656a (bii), using the protocol shown schematically in inset of bi; the traces show inward current tails
in high [k]o (cf [15]). inward wt iherg tails (bi) were
profoundly inhibited by lfz, whilst the blocking effect was
reduced to <50% for f656 (bi and  xxxg303xxx ). thus, interactions
with these two aromatic amino acid residues (and with y652
in particular) are important for high affinity herg blockade
by lfz.
in conclusion, this report demonstrates that lfz is a high
affinity inhibitor of the  xxxg1246xxx  and this action is
likely to constitute the molecular basis of qt interval prolongation previously established to occur with this drug [1-3].
notably, we have also shown that lfz is far more potent
against herg (by ~ 13 fold) than is verapamil (a significantly less proarrhythmic agent [3]) under identical conditions. lfz also appears more potent than the previously
studied antianginal agent  xxxd2884xxx  (ic50 of 7.8 µm in
cho-k1 cells [14]), and than  xxxd2638xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  (ic50
values of 0.55 and 1.43 µm in cos cells [13]), suggesting
that lfz is one of the most potent herg-blocking ca2+channel blockers thus far identified.
