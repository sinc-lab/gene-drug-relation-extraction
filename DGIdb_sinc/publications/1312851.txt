several studies have suggested that pulmonary toxicity to asbestos and silica may be mediated through
oxidant-induced cell injury. we have reported recently that surface radicals associated with freshly fractured
silica may be an important factor in cell injury and induction of pulmonary disease. although the generation
of oxygenated radicals in dust-cell interactions has been demonstrated, there are no data correlating the
toxicity of a dust with the level of oxygenradical generation by the dust during its interaction with phagocytic
cells. in the present study, we have investigated the in vitro generation of oxygen free radicals from human
neutrophils and rat alveolar macrophages stimulated with freshly fractured silica, aged silica, amosite,
crocidolite, chrysotile, and a nontoxic dust, barite. electron spin resonance (esr) with the aid of a spin
trap phenyl-n-tert-butyl nitrone (pbn) was used to measure the oxygen radicals generated during phagocytosis of the dusts. the relative toxicity index and esr peak heights, on an equal surface area basis and
normalized to barite as one, showed a direct relationship. the normalized toxicity indices and peak heights
were: silica, 3.5 versus 2; chrysotile, 4 versus 2; crocidolite, 11 versus 8; and amosite, 26 versus 13. addition of hydroxyl radical scavengers such as catalase,  xxxd1896xxx , 1,3 dimethyl-2-thiourea (dmtu),
sodium benzoate, and mannitol prevented the radical generation.  xxxd444xxx , a  xxxg981xxx -glutathione peroxidase inhibitor, caused a 5-fold increase in the radical generation. these results indicate that a nontoxic dust such as barite generates toxic oxygen radicals at a minimal level that can be
quenched by the normal cellular defense system. for toxic dusts such as silica, amosite, chrysotile, and
crocidolite, the potential for oxygen radical generation is enhanced by their surface properties, physical
dimensions, and the surface-based radical-generating redox sites. the enhanced radical generation may impair the cellular defense system, resulting in cell injury. use of scavengers, chelators, and potentiating agents
suggests the membrane-based oxidase system as the probable primary source of the radical-generating system. the data presented herein suggest the generation of oxygen free radicals as an important primary event
in silica- as well as asbestos-induced cell injury.

inhalation of asbestos and crystalline silica produces pneumoconiosis, a lung disease characterized by the development
of pulmonary fibrosis and dyspnea (1). although information
continues to accumulate regarding the various pathogenetic
mechanisms, the basic macromolecular events by which
fibrogenic dusts exert their toxic effectsremain poorly understood. it is believed, however, that one event of primary importance is the perturbation of the cell membrane of phago(received in original form june 10, 1991 and in revisedform september 23,

cytes that playa central role as effector cells in dust-cell
interactions leading to the stimulated cell-mediated secretions and inflammatory responses (2-6). these dust-cell interactions may result in the release of lysosomal enzymes,
superoxide anion (or),  xxxd2298xxx  (h202) , and
fibrogenic and chemotactic factors (2-6). recent studies
have suggested that several oxygen radical species and their
metabolites may be involved in causing cell injury in asbestos and silica toxicity (7-14). in this respect, considerable
effort is currently being devoted toward the understanding of
surface properties and the chemical structure of the dust particles that enhance the generation of oxygen free radicals
(11-14). weitzman and graceffa (15) and zalma and associates (16) have shown that all types of asbestos can catalyze
the generation of hydroxyl radical (·or) from exogenous
h202 • the ·or radical-generating potential of asbestos appeared to be associated with the presence of fe2+ in the asbestos, although it was not linearly dependent on the fe2+
concentration.

vallyathan, mega, shi et al.: dust-induced generation of free radicals

earlier studies have suggested that freshly fractured silica
reacts with aqueous media to produce h 202 (17). gulumian
and wyk (18) reported the generation of ·oh radicals from
h202 added to silica. kennedy and colleagues (19) postulated that silicate minerals causing pneumoconiosis generate
·oh radicals and produce hemolysis by acting as fenton
catalysts. recently, our studies have shown that fracturing of
crystalline silica generates silicon-oxygen (si and sio) radicals on the surface of particles that, upon interaction with
aqueous media, result in the generation of ·oh radicals
(11-14). furthermore, we have shown a direct correlation between the concentration of si and sio radicals on the freshly
fractured silica and the increased biologic reactivity of silica
to cause lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity (11-14).
several studies have suggested that pulmonary toxicity to
asbestos and silica may occur through oxidant-induced cell
injury (7-14). it is apparent from these studies that the potential of asbestos in the lung to undergo repeated attempts of
frustrated phagocytosis may be greater than for the fibrogenic dusts like silica that are easily phagocytosed by the
cells. these frustrated phagocytic events would be expected
to generate a greater concentration of oxygen free radicals.
furthermore, it is likely that the radical generation potential
of asbestos is related not only to the concentration of fe2+
but also to the surface active sites available for interaction
and the physical properties of the fibers.
the generation of oxygen radicals in toxic dust-cell interaction has been well documented with the aid of chemiluminescence (20-23). superoxide dismutase (sod)-inhibitable
reduction of  xxxg569xxx  is often considered direct evidence for the generation of or radical (24). however,
there is no direct evidence for the generation of free radicals
involved in biologic reactions and its relationship to the
dust's toxicity potential. furthermore, the mechanism and
type of dust-induced oxygen free radical generation remain
speculative. therefore, in the present study, we have investigated the in vitro generation of oxygen free radicals from
human neutrophils (pmn) and rat alveolar macrophages
(am) stimulated with freshly fractured silica, aged silica,
amosite, crocidolite, chrysotile, and a nontoxic dust, barite.
electron spin resonance (esr) with the aid of a lipid-soluble
spin trap was used as the method of choice for the direct measurement of oxygen free radicals generated. the results show
that an enhancement in the generation of oxygen free radicals
from the interaction of phagocytes and toxic mineral dust
correlates with the apparent cytotoxicity of the dust (25, 26)
and that direct in vitro esr spin trapping may be a valuable
technique in the screening of dusts causing pneumoconiosis.

ing medium ( xxxd3253xxx -hypaque) was obtained from flow
laboratories (mclean, va). chrysotile (quebec, canada),
amosite (transvall, south africa), and crocidolite (kalahari
desert, south africa) were obtained from the national institute of environmental health sciences (research triangle
park, nc). these samples have been chemically and physically characterized in detail (27). crystalline silica (southern aggregates quarry, stanley, nc) was obtained from the
generic respirable dust technology center, pennsylvania
state university (state college, pa). fresh silica was prepared by grinding crystalline silica in an agate centrifugal
ball grinder for 30 min (iec, needham, ma). ground silica
was sieved through a 20-p.m mesh filter and used within 30
min as fresh silica, and half of the ground silica stock was
stored for a minimum of 14 days in vials shielded from light
and used as "aged silica." these samples of "fresh" and "aged"
dust from the same stock assured uniformity in particle size
distribution for comparing biologic effects. barite (bas04)
was used as an inert dust control and was obtained from
georgia barite co. (augusta, ga). representative samples
of the ground silica and barite were subjected to x-ray spectrometric analysis to confirm the mineralogic purity and to
determine possible contamination. morphometric analysis
of dust preparations on randomly selected scanning micrographs and by automated image analysis were used to characterize the size differences. quantitative elemental analyses
were carried out by proton-induced x-ray emission analysis
(pixe) or by atomic absorption spectrometry (28). mineral
surface area measurements were made by the nitrogen adsorption technique (29). all the minerals were suspended in
phosphate-buffered saline at ph 7.4 and mixed in a vortex
before use.
esr
esr measurements were made with a bruker er200d spectrometer operating at x-band ( rv 9.7 ghz) frequency. for the
measurements of the g values, the magnetic field was
calibrated with a self-tracking nmr gaussmeter (bruker
model er035m) and the microwave frequency was measured with a hewlett-packard frequency counter (model
5340a). all the measurements were made at room temperature with the typical spectrometer settings: receiver gain,
3.2 x 105 ; microwave power, 50 mw; modulation amplitude, 2 g; scan time, 100 s; time constant, 1 s, and magnetic
field, 3,470 ± 50 g; using a rectangular te 102 resonant
cavity equipped with a fiat quartz cell.
cell preparation
whole blood was obtained from healthy human volunteer
donors using heparinized vacutainer tubes. pmn were isolated by the gradient separation of blood cells, i.e., centrifugation at 300 x g for 30 min at room temperature, using
mono-poly resolving medium containing polysaccharide
( xxxd3253xxx -400) and a radio opaque contrast medium (hypaque
85). the mononuclear leukocyte bands were drawn with a
pasteur pipette, washed, centrifuged, and suspended in
hepes-buffered medium containing 140 mm naci, 5 mm
kci, 1 mm caci2, 10 mm hepes, and 5 mm glucose.
am were harvested from male specific pathogen-free
sprague-dawley rats by bronchopulmonary lavage using a
calcium- and magnesium-free hanks'  xxxd2988xxx

(11). macrophages from eight repetitive lavages were sedimented by centrifugation at 500 x g for 10 min at 4° c. the
cells were pooled, washed, centrifuged, and resuspended in
hepes-buffered medium.
cell viability and purity estimates were made with the
trypan blue dye exclusion technique using optical microscopy (30). cell counts and purity estimates were also determined with an automated electronic cell counter, model
zbl/channelizer, model c256 (coulter electronics, hialeah, fl). these studies revealed a 96 and 93% purity and
93 and 95 % viability for pmn and am, respectively. cell
suspensions (2.5 x 106/ml) were made in hepes-buffered
medium.
spin trapping
reaction mixtures in a total volume of 3.5 ml contained 1 ml
pmn or am (2.5 x 106 ) , 2 mlo.1 m pbn, and a mineral
dust. control experiments were carried out in the absence of
mineral dusts, with inactivated cells, without cells, and without pbn. the optimal dust concentrations required for the
maximal generation of esr signals were determined from
a series of preliminary experiments. silica and barite were
tested in concentrations of 50, 100, 250, and 2,500 j.tg/ml,
and amosite, crocidolite, and chrysotile were tested in concentrations of 50, 100, and 500 j.tg/ml. from these preliminary studies, 250 j.tg/ml for the particulate minerals and 50
j.tglml for the fibrous minerals were selected as adequate
concentrations to generate detectable esr signals without
inducing cell death or disruption during the l-h incubation.
all the comparisons of particulate minerals were made at
250 j.tg/ml and for fibers at 50 j.tg/ml. at these mass concentrations, the specific surface areas available for these
minerals were: barite, 14.5 x 10-4 m-; silica, 4.0 x 10-4
m-; amosite, 2 x 10-4 m-; crocidolite, 4.9 x 10-4 m-; and
chrysotile, 12.45 x 10-4 m-. all the samples were incubated at 37° c in an oscillating water bath for 1 h. incubation was terminated by the addition of 10 ml chloroform:methanol (2:1), and the total lipids were extracted
according to the procedure of folch and colleagues (31). the
extracted lipids were evaporated in a water bath at 100° c
and dissolved in 0.5 ml chloroform, and aliquots were transferred to a flat esr quartz cell for esr measurements. the
water bath evaporation of the lipid extract was found to have
no significant effecton the pbn adduct formed and its recovery on a quantitative or qualitative basis. this was determined on aliquots of lipid extracts evaporated by water bath
and by nitrogen bubbling. recovery of internal standards was
found to be > 92 % during the preparative procedure. loss
of signal intensity was> 50% in 8 h, and within 24 h there
was a 90% loss of signal from the pbn adduct. therefore,
all the esr measurements were made within 30 min.
radical scavengers and promoters
allopurinol, catalase, gsh, sodium benzoate, dmso,
dmtu, glucose, mannitol, nadph,  xxxd444xxx ,  xxxd1824xxx , and detapac are evaluated for their radical scavenging properties. each compound was added to the incubation
medium before the addition of stimulant in different concentrations to determine the most effective dose response. in
other experiments, minerals were presoaked in detapac

and  xxxd1824xxx  for 10 min and washed, centrifuged, and
resuspended 3 times before incubation with the cells.
statistical analysis
measurements of peak to peak heights in the esr spectrum,
which are roughly proportional to the concentration of radical adducts formed, were used as a measure of the radicalgenerating potential of the various dusts. data presented in
table 1 are the mean peak heights ± sem. comparisons
were made using student's two-tailed t test. in all data comparisons, a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant unless otherwise indicated.

results
the results obtained from this study indicate that oxygen free
radicals generated by the stimulation of phagocytes can be
trapped efficiently by pbn and the pbn adduct formed is
stable for several hours. there was an approximate 50 % loss
of peak intensity in 8 hand 90 % loss in signal intensity after
storage for 24 h at room temperature. for the intercellular
and intracellular trapping of free radicals, pbn appeared to
be the best choice in view of its low cytotoxicity, lipid solubility, and permeability to the cellular membranes and organelles within the cells. this ability of pbn to diffuse to
the cellular sites of radical production is critical in the
efficient trapping of all radicals generated.
mineral dust-stimulated radical generation
phagocytosis of particulate dust by the pmn and am were
studied by light microscopy after the termination of dust exposure. histologic preparations on glass slides were stained
with diff-quik or wright-giemsa stains and examined for
the presence of phagocytosed particles within cells. these
light microscopic evaluations confirmed the phagocytosis of
all the minerals by several cells within the exposure period
of 1 h. in order to compare the relationship between oxygen
free radical generation during the respiratory burst and
mineral toxicity, we studied the effects of barite (a nontoxic
dust), aged silica, freshly fractured silica, amosite, crocido-

lite, and chrysotile fibers using both the human pmn and rat
am. both types of phagocytes yielded essentially comparable results except that pmn produced a somewhat greater
quantity of radicals than the am as measured from the esr
spectrum peak heights. because of this insignificant difference, the results presented here are either for pmn or for
am. figure 1 shows some typical results of esr spin trapping measurements. an aqueous 0.1 m solution of the spin
trap pbn alone did not show any detectable esr spectrum
(figure la). omission of the dust also did not produce any
esr spectrum (figure ib). when pmn or am were stimulated with the inert dust barite, a typical esr spectrum of
oxygen free radical adducts of pbn was observed (figure
lc). this spectrum did not show any increase in peak intensity when barite concentration was increased. freshly fractured crystalline silica, on the other hand, showed a spectrum with higher peak intensity, i.e., an enhanced radical
generation with an increased dose of silica (figures id and
ie). silica aged for 14 days generated weaker radical signals
compared with freshly fractured silica (figure if). omission of the phagocytes, stimulant, or pbn resulted in the total loss of signals, indicating that the observed esr spectra
are due to the oxygen radicals generated during phagocytosis
of dust. because only a very small amount of freshly fractured silica (50 p.g to 2.5 mg) was used in these experiments,
the oxygen free radicals generated by the reaction of freshly
fractured silica with aqueous media itself do not contribute
significantly to the spectrum generated during phagocytosis.
as reported earlier, it would require a concentration of
80 mg silica/ml to observe a typical esr spectrum (11, 12).
to evaluate the possible role of fiber dimensions and iron
concentration in the generation of oxygen free radicals during phagocytosis, we tested three types of fibers: amosite,
crocidolite, and chrysotile containing different concentrations of elemental iron and fiber characteristics (table 2).
amosite and crocidolite contained approximately 34 and
18 % elemental iron, respectively, whereas chrysotile contained < 1% elemental iron (27). when pmn and am were
stimulated with any of the three types of fibers, the observed
esr spectra were similar to those generated by stimulation
with silica (figure 2). chrysotile and amosite fibers generated weak radical signals 'whereas crocidolite generated a
fairly strong esr spectrum (figures' 2a, 2b, and 2c).

figure 2. esr spectra obtained from pmn (2 x 106 cells) stimulated with 50 ij.g of asbestos fibers in the presence of 2.5 ml 0.1 m
pbn. spectrum 2a represents radical generation with crocidolite
fibers. spectrum 2b represents radical generation with amosite
fibers, and spectrum 2c represents radical generation with chrysotile fibers. note the crocidolite fibers generated approximately 70
to 75 % more radical peak intensity than the amosite and chrysotile
fibers.

therefore, the potential of fibers to generate oxygen radicals
did not directly correlate with the total amount of iron present in these three fibers, and further studies were undertaken
to explore the basis for this difference.
dependence of radical generation on iron
asbestos, which contains fe2+ and fe3+, has been shown to
catalyze the generation of ·oh radical in cell-free systems
(15). therefore, the radical-generating potential of asbestos
appears to be related to the concentration of fe2+ and fe3+
and their available sites for reactivity. addition of iron
(fe2+) to the incubation medium resulted in a substantial
increase in the radical generation (figure 3b). detapac,
a metal-chelating agent, is known to inhibit the ironcatalyzed haber-weiss reaction, preventing the oy-dependent ·oh radical generation and enhancing the ·oh formation via direct fenton reaction. when 0.1 mm detapac
was added directly to the incubation medium, there was a
2-fold increase in the esr spectral intensity (figure 3c),
suggesting that the ·oh radicals are generated via the fenton
reaction. on the other hand, when the minerals were presoaked for 10 min in detapac or  xxxd1824xxx  and added
to the incubation medium, the generation of free radical was
inhibited to approximately 80% (figures 3d and 3e). these
results suggest that or-dependent ·oh generation through
the haber-weiss cycle also plays an important role in the
·oh radical formation. therefore, these results suggest that
the fenton reaction (fe2+ oxidation) and the haber-weiss
cycle (fe3+ reduction) play equally significant roles in the
generation of radicals from asbestos.

effect of scavengers
to elucidate the free radical-generating mechanism and to
identify the type of radicals trapped by the pbn, we added
scavengers to the incubation medium. am and pmn were
incubated in the presence of sod (200 p.glml), catalase (50
p.g/ml), or a combination of both, gsh (0.1 mm), dmso
(0.1 mm), dmtu (10 p.m), sodium benzoate (10 p.m), or.
mannitol (0.1 mm). the results of these studies are presented
in figure 4. catalase prevented approximately 85 % of the
oxygen free radical generation, indicating that h20 2 plays
an important role in the radical generation mechanism (figure 4b). sod on the other hand was less effective and in-

hibited only 20 % of free radical generation (figure 4c).
catalase and sod in combination also did not completely
prevent the radical generation (figure 4d). gsh, an important antioxidant, prevented approximately 80 % of the radical
generation (figure 4e). addition of ·oh radical scavengers

409

such as sodium benzoate, mannitol, dmtu, or dmso
resulted in a significant inhibition of oxygen radical generation during phagocytosis (figures 4f, 4g, 4h, and 41).
these results, representing the mean of two observations,
suggest that the predominant radical species generated during the interactions of dust with phagocytes and trapped by
pbn are ·oh radicals.
effect of potentiating agents
to evaluate the role of the cellular defense system against
oxygen free radical generation, we studied the effect of  xxxd444xxx , a potent inhibitor of the glutathione reductaseglutathione peroxidase system, which is known to potentiate
oxygen toxicity resulting in severe pulmonary fibrosis (32).
preincubation of cells with 100 jlm  xxxd444xxx  resulted in
a 5-fold increase in the generation of free radicals with
crocidolite fibers (figure 5a). similarly, with other dusts,
the generation of free radicals was enhanced upon preincubation with  xxxd444xxx . these results suggest that the
 xxxg981xxx -glutathione peroxidase system is an
important defense system in the lung against dust-induced
free radical generation by phagocytes and thus prevention of
cell injury.
it is known that cell membrane-based nadph oxidase
is the enzyme responsible for the production of oi- by
stimulated phagocytes. therefore, it was of considerable interest to find whether exogenous nadph would enhance the
free radical generation during phagocytosis of dusts. incubation of pmn and am with 100 jlm nadph and dust
resulted in an increase in the free radical generation. with
pmn and crocidolite fibers, nadph enhanced the radical
generation to approximately 139% (figure 5b). these results suggest that the nadph oxidase system present in the
cell membrane is likely to be an important pathway in the
generation of free radicals during dust phagocytosis. glucose, on the other hand, resulted in a 35 % inhibition of
radical generated in the in vitro studies (figure 5c). this inhibition by glucose may well be the result of its possible
.oh-scavenging properties.
allopurinol, a competitive inhibitor of the  xxxg2431xxx  system, was evaluated to determine whether this pathway contributes to the radical generation. addition of allopurinol to the incubation medium resulted in a 30 %
decrease in free radical generation (figure 5d), which may
have resulted partly because of its direct radical-scavenging
properties. additionally, this decrease may also reflect the
scavenging of radicals from the total pool. these results
therefore suggest that the contribution of  xxxg2431xxx 
pathway in the generation of oxygen free radicals during the
phagocytosis of the dusts is relatively minor compared with
that generated through the membrane-based oxidase system.
the oxygen free radical-generating potentials of the dusts
were evaluated on a linear scale in relation to their known
toxicity. the esr spectra were compared using the mean
peak heights. for these comparisons, the pmn and am
stimulated with equal mass concentrations of particulate
dusts and equal mass concentrations of fibrous dusts with
equal number of cells were compared by the peak-to-peak
heights in the esr spectra. averages of the peak heights in
millimeters obtained from single esr scans are presented in

data that there is no correlation between toxicity and esr
peak heights (i.e., free radical generation).
table 4 summarizes the toxicity and esr data on equal
surface area (0.1 m-) basis. in this table, we have introduced the overall toxicity index, which was derived by adding all three (lactate dehydrogenase, i3-n-acetyl glucosaminidase, (3-glucuronidase) toxicity data and normalizing
to one for the inert dust barite. similarly, the esr peak
heights on an equal surface area basis were also normalized
to one for barite. the data indicate a positive correlation between the toxicity index and esr peak heights. this correlation is more clearly evident in the data presented in figure
6, wherein we plotted the normalized relative toxicity index
versus the normalized esr heights.

table 1. table 2 presents data on mineral size dimensions,
surface area, iron content, and the corresponding esr peak
heights calculated on an equal surface area as well as on
equal mass basis. the data indicate a positive correlation between esr peak heights and fiber dimension and iron content, whereas esr peak heights on equal mass basis showed
no correlation.
table 3 illustrates the relationship between the toxicity
data of dusts reported earlier (25, 26) and the esr peak

the results presented here provide esr spectrometric evidence that potentially toxic dusts such as amosite, crocidolite, and chrysotile fibers and crystalline silica generate toxic
oxygen free radicals during their interaction with phagocytes. the data also show that the amount of oxygen free radicals generated is directly related to the known toxicity of the
dust (25, 26).
it is well recognized that pmn and am are uniquely endowed with the potential to generate reactive oxygen free
radicals when they encounter invading microorganisms, inhaled particles, or other stimuli (33-36). the resulting
phagocytosis triggers a "respiratory burst," which is characterized by an increase in oxygen uptake, increase in glucose
breakdown, and utilization of nadph and oxygen by a
plasma membrane-bound oxidase, leading to the generation
of oxygen radicals (37-39). generation of these reactive oxygen radicals also is a normal by-product of cellular metabolism and oxidation reduction reactions (35). pulmonary cells
are normally protected against the toxic effects of radicals by
a well balanced battery of extracellular and intracellular defense systems, including sod, catalase, glutathione peroxi- .
dase, ascorbate,  xxxd3521xxx , albumin, and  xxxg500xxx 
(37-39). however, increased production of oxygen free radicals and their metabolites may occur in occupational exposures as a result of the repeated processes of phagocytosis,
frustrated phagocytosis, or because of the phagocytosis of
particles with reactive oxygen free radicals or other sites of

redox potential. the enhanced generation of oxygen free
radicals as a result of the phagocytosis of such particulates
may impair or overwhelm the cellular defense system,
thereby resulting in cell injury (7, 9, 11, 40).
our results (table 1)show enhanced generation of oxygen
free radicals from phagocytes stimulated with freshly fractured silica as compared with aged silica. this enhanced radical generation resulting from the phagocytosis of freshly
fractured silica is partly attributable to the potential of the
surface free radicals present on the silica. it was shown that
the surface based si and sio radicals present on the freshly
fractured silica would interact with aqueous media to generate ·oh radicals, which in turn are capable of initiating lipid
peroxidation (11-13). furthermore, the potential of freshly
fractured silica to disrupt the phagosomes and repeat the
phagocytosis process is greater than aged silica (11). therefore, the amount of oxygen free radicals generated by the
stimulation of phagocytes by freshly fractured silica is expected to be greater than the amount generated from aged
silica with comparable size dimension with the same number

of phagocytic cells. in contrast to freshly fractured silica and
aged silica, barite, a nontoxic dust, stimulated the generation
of the least amount of free radicals from phagocytes, thereby
indicating a possible correlation between a dust's toxicity
and its oxygen radical-generating potential.
the asbestos minerals (amosite, crocidolite, and chrysotile), on the other hand, with different physical dimensions
and chemical composition, showed complex results. crocidolite fibers with a mean fiber length of 10 jlm stimulated
a greater burst of oxygen free radicals than amosite and
chrysotile, which have longer fiber lengths (table 2). although physical dimensions are considered as important factors in the generation of oxygen free radicals resulting in the
frustrated attempts of phagocytosis (41), our results do not
fully support this hypothesis. on the other hand, the concentrations of fe" and its available sites in the asbestos fibers
appear to be a major factor in the generation of oxygen free
radicals.
several studies have shown that the ability of fibers to
generate ·oh radicals in cell-free systems is iron dependent.
among the three types of asbestos used in this study, amosite
contains the highest concentration of elemental iron (34 %)
followed by crocidolite (18%) and chrysotile (1 %). as can be
noted from the results in table 4, amosite exhibited a greater
potential for oxygen freeradical generation than did crocidolite and chrysotile. furthermore, when the fibers were preincubated with  xxxd1824xxx  to chelate the iron, the generation of oxygen free radicals was significantly inhibited for all
three samples. although these results suggest a key role for
iron in the radical generation, the fiber dimensions and the
redox potential sites of fibers also appear to be important factors involved in the process. therefore, frustrated phagocytosis, potential redox sites, fiber dimensions, and the total
surface area of the fiber appear to be influential in the radical
generation mechanism.
it is well established that during the stimulus-induced "respiratory burst" of phagocytic cells superoxide and hzoz
are liberated (33-39). our results show that an enhanced
generation of oxygen free radicals is caused by freshly fractured crystalline silica and asbestos fibers in direct correlation with their known cytotoxicity. the comparative toxicity
and esr data presented in tables 2 and 4 demonstrate that
the mineral dust toxicity correlates directly with the dust's
free radical generation potential when compared on the basis
of equal surface area. however, no correlation was found on

the basis of equal mass concentration (table 3). figure 6 illustrates the positive correlation between the mineral dust's
toxicity index and esr peak heights (oxygen free radical
generation capacity) on an equal surface area basis. both the
toxicity data and the esr peak heights were normalized to
one for the inert dust barite. these results, together with the
data on fiber dimensions, indicate that fiber dimensions and
the availability of active surface sites are the significant factors in the enhanced oxygen radical generation and, hence,
toxicity.
we have observed that all of the ·oh radical scavengers
used, catalase, dmtu, dmso, mannitol, and sodium benzoate, were effective in the prevention of oxygen free radical
generation whereas sod was only 20% effective. this
strong reduction in esr signal intensity by catalase and
other ·oh radical scavengers indicates that the trapped species are predominantly ·oh radicals. it is possible that the
plasma membrane-based nadph oxidase becomes enclosed with the phagosome, resulting in the enhanced generation of oi- which on dismutation produces h20 2 at a rapid
rate. this h20 2 in the presence of fe2+ may produce the
damaging ·oh radicals (42). recent in vivo studies on the
inhibition of lung injury, inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis by  xxxd2982xxx -conjugated catalase give support
to this hypothesis of lung injury (43).
in addition to the commonly used oxygen radical scavengers, we have used  xxxd444xxx . this drug, commonly used
as an antineoplastic agent, is known to inhibit the glutathione
reductase-glutathione peroxidase system, which is an important component of the pulmonary defense system. several
studies have shown that this defense system can be effectively
inactivated by  xxxd444xxx , thereby rendering am vulnerable
to oxidative injury (44, 45). in addition to this specific inhibition of  xxxg981xxx ,  xxxd444xxx  may also injure
cells by alkylating dna and rna and by the inhibition of
other enzymes (32). the potential of this drug to induce adverse pulmonary reactions leading to pulmonary fibrosis in
laboratory animals and humans is well documented (32, 46,
47). the data from the present study show the potential of
 xxxd444xxx  in the enhanced generation of oxygen radicals.
however, the spectrum of  xxxd444xxx -induced radicals is
different and needs further investigation.
we have carried out additional experiments to discriminate between the quantity of free radicals generated
through the activation of the phagocyte membrane oxidase
system and that resulting from the catalytic property of asbestos. sod-inhibitable  xxxg569xxx  reduction was monitored after the exposure of rat am to similar concentrations
of asbestos dusts. the results obtained on an equal surface
area basis strongly suggest that amosite (20.5 mmol) ,
crocidolite (7.5 mmol), and chrysotile (5.6 mmol) induced
the release of o 2- only in the presence of am. asbestos
without cells caused no detectable reduction of cytochrome
c. these observations are also consistent with the data of
hansen and mossman (48) and donaldson and associates
(49). on the other hand, weitzman and graceffa (15) have
demonstrated the generation of ·oh and oy radicals in a
cell-free system from h20 2 and asbestos. their studies (15)
show a direct correlation between the iron content of asbestos and radical generation. although fe2+ is the major
source of the 'oh radical generation, results from other

studies suggest alternative pathways. for example, it was
shown that iron might reduce oxygen directly (50). second,
it is known that fiberglass and other iron-free mineral fibers
can also cause the release of such radical generation. therefore, the ability of fibrous minerals, including asbestos, to
produce free radicals upon interaction with plasma membrane is indisputable. in this context, the physical dimensions and surface properties of asbestos might play only an
ancillary role in augmenting the generation of oxygen free
radicals.
from the esr signals alone, it is not possible to positively identify the trapped radical species. this is because
the pbn-adduct esr spectra are nonspecific, and the data
obtained can only provide information on the total pool of
oxygenated or carbon-centered radicals. from the data
presented, we have concluded that the pbn-trapped radical
species are primarily ·oh radicals. this conclusion is based
on the following results: (1) catalase significantly inhibited
the esr signals; (2) 'sod caused only a slight (f\j20%)
reduction in esr signal; (3) addition of fe2+ to the incubation medium induced a substantial increase in the amount of
radical trapped; (4) addition of detapac, which is known
to inhibit metal-iron-mediated ·oh generation, induced a
significant enhancement in the esr signal; and (5) ·oh
scavengers such as sodium benzoate, dmso, dmtu, or
mannitol inhibited the esr signals. additional support for
this conclusion was obtained from the above-mentioned data
on sod-inhibitable  xxxg569xxx  reduction by rat am exposed to the various dusts. am with all three asbestos dusts
induced significant levels of  xxxg569xxx  reduction,
whereas the nontoxic dust barite caused only a minimal
reduction. the data therefore indicate the role of membranebased oxidase system in the generation of oxygen radicals.
therefore, it is concluded that the trapped species are mainly
·oh radicals, mostly derived from the membrane-based
liberation of o;- occurring during phagocytosis.
the present results indicate that the phagocytosis of toxic
and inert mineral dusts by the pmn or am results in an enhancement in the generation of oxygen free radicals at levels
directly related to their known toxicity on an equal surface
area basis. for toxic dusts such as silica, amosite, crocidolite, and chrysotile fibers, the oxygen free radicals produced
are influenced by physical dimensions, chemical characteristics, density of surface active sites, fe2+ content, and its redox potential sites as well as the extent of repeated phagocytosis. the enhanced production of oxygen free radicals may
also result in the initiation of lipid peroxidation and eventually in cell death. this production of oxygen free radicals appears to be an important primary event in the silica- and
asbestos-induced cell injury.
