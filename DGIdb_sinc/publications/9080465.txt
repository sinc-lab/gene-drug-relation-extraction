abstract
the effect of the drug sr 48692 on the ca2+-activated cl− current induced by  xxxg1618xxx  on xenopus oocytes injected with crnas
encoding rodent high and low affinity  xxxg1618xxx  receptors, was examined. in this receptor expression system, sr 48692 failed to
antagonize electrophysiological measurement of  xxxg1618xxx -evoked current via the rat high affinity  xxxg1618xxx  receptor, whereas its
application onto oocytes expressing the mouse low affinity  xxxg1618xxx  receptor triggered an inward current, as well as  xxxg1618xxx 
itself. however, no current activation was observed after application of the drug on oocytes expressing the rat high affinity  xxxg1618xxx 
receptor. these observations in the oocyte expression system did not reflect typical antagonist properties of sr 48692 drug.  1997

the neuropeptide  xxxg1618xxx  (nt) [1] has been shown
to interact with two classes of specific membrane receptors, distinct by their affinity and their sensitivity to
the h1 anti-histaminic drug  xxxd2469xxx  (for review,
see ref. [11]). the molecular identification of the rat
and human high affinity  xxxd2469xxx  insensitive nt
receptors (ntrh) [10,12], and more recently, of the low
affinity  xxxd2469xxx -sensitive nt receptors (ntrl)
from mouse and rat [3,8] allowed to classify these proteins
in the  xxxg89xxx  family. functional
investigations carried out on the mouse ntrl in the
oocyte expression system revealed an agonist profile of
 xxxd2469xxx  [8].
recently, a non-peptidic nt antagonist, sr 48692, was

developed [5]. this compound was shown to inhibit the
nt-induced hypomotility in rat and displayed a relative
affinity of 12 nm for the cloned rat ntrh [5,6]. moreover,
sr 48692 was shown to block nt-induced ca2+ accumulation in ltk cells stably transfected with the rat ntrh
[2]. by contrast, sr 48692 was unable to block ntinduced hypothermia and analgesia in mouse and rat [4]
and exhibited a weaker relative affinity for the mouse
ntrl of 200 nm [8], suggesting that the hypothermic
and analgesic responses to nt could be mediated by the
ntrl type. to date, the sr 48692 compound is therefore
considered as a potent antagonist of high affinity nt
receptors class, allowing the distinction of nt-induced
behavioural effects occurring through this receptor type.
in order to compare effects of sr 48692 on response
triggered by nt, in oocytes expressing either the mouse
ntrl or the rat ntrh, the corresponding crnas were
injected into oocytes and nt-induced ca2+ release monitored by ca2+-activated cl− current [7,10] was examined in

fig. 1. electrophysiological responses recorded after application of 10−8

mouse ntrl. inward cl− currents were recorded at −60 mv. arrowheads indicated fast nt applications.

the presence or in the absence of sr 48692. complementary rnas were prepared by using the in vitro transcription kit (stratagene) with the pcdna3 vector (invitrogen)
containing the cdna encoding either the rat ntrh [10] or
the mouse ntrl [8] as template. crnas (10 ng) were
subsequently injected into xenopus laevis oocytes. the
oocytes were then incubated at 18°c for 2–4 days before
performing electrophysiological measurements at 20°c as
previously described [7]. drugs were rapidly applied into
the experimental chamber by a puffer pipette (200 ml).
electrophysiological responses to nt and sr 48692
were recorded under voltage clamp at −60 mv. it is important to note that no current was observed after the application of 10−8 m nt or 10−7 m sr 48692 on non-injected
oocytes (data not shown).
application of 10−8 m nt on oocytes injected with rat
ntrh or mouse ntrl crnas, induced an inward calcium-activated chloride current (fig. 1a,b), due to a coupling of these receptors to phospholipase c [8,10]. note
that in both cases, a second application of nt always
induced a lower amplitude of the response certainly due
to desensitization as already observed [7,11]. however,
the greater current amplitude obtained with the rat
ntrh (1.5 ma; fig. 1a) as compared to that of the

fig. 3. electrophysiological responses recorded with xenopus laevis
oocyte expressing the mouse ntrl (a) following fast application of
10−8 m nt or 10−7 m sr 48692, (b) following injection of 10 nl of
10−5 m sr 48692.

mouse ntrl (0.1 ma; fig. 1b) was probably due to their
different affinity for the peptide and to a different coupling
efficiency to ca2+ release via the phosphoinositides pathway which could be the consequence of the activation of
different g-proteins subtypes.
on oocytes expressing the rat ntrh, able to respond to
nt (fig. 2a), sr 48692 (10−7 m) was unable to antagonize
nt response, although this concentration was able to
totally displace nt binding to ntrh expressed in ltk
cells [2], and was also devoid of intrinsic agonist activity
(fig. 2a). in conditions where oocytes expressing the rat
ntrh were preincubated for 30 min with 10−7 m sr
48692, the following application both of 10−8 nt and of
10−7 m sr 48692 resulted in a typical electrophysiological
response to nt (fig. 2b). thus, sr 48692 failed to act as a
nt antagonist on the rat ntrh expressed in oocyte system. on oocytes expressing the mouse ntrl, sr 48692
induced an inward current with an amplitude similar to that
recorded following application of nt (fig. 3a). this unusual behaviour suggested that sr 48692 could act as an
agonist on the ntrl in this heterologous expression system.
in order to prevent a potential intracellular action of sr
48692, the drug being hydrophobic and able to cross-over
plasma membranes, 10 nl of 10−5 m sr 48692 were
injected into oocytes expressing either the rat ntrh
(fig. 2c) or the mouse ntrl (fig. 3b). in both cases, no
ca2+-activated cl− current response was observed. moreover, nt-induced responses on oocytes bearing the ntrh
or the ntrl were not affected by the intracellular injection of sr 48692 (figs. 2c and 3b).

among pharmacological effects induced by central
administration of nt, sr 48692 was described to selectively antagonize the mouse turning behaviour induced by
intrastriatal injection of nt [5] and the nt-induced hypomotility in the rat [4]. by contrast, sr 48692 was shown to
be inefficient on nt-mediated hypothermia and analgesia
in mouse and rat [4]. these in vivo observations have been
initially explained by the existence of at least two different
types of nt receptors, one of them, the ntrh type, being
sensitive to sr 48692 [4].
among in vitro biological effects provoked by nt, sr
48692 exhibited an inhibitory action on the nt potentiation of k+-evoked dopamine-release from cultured rat
mesencephalic neurons [5], but was shown unable to
antagonize nt-induced action potentials on rat dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta
[9], a region rich in the ntrh type. although the numerous studies demonstrating the antagonist behaviour of sr
48692 on the ntrh type, the lack of antagonist effect on
substantia nigra neurons [9] and on oocytes expressing the
ntrh (the present study), remains difficult to understand
for such a described antagonist drug. these latter characteristics added to the agonist-like activity of sr 48692
observed on the ntrl type expressed in oocytes rise the
problem upon the interpretation of the spectrum of action
of this compound.
