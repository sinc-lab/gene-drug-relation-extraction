summary
clinical and animal model evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (ssris) act as anticonvulsants. the present studies tested the possibility that the
el mouse model of genetically predisposed/handling-triggered epilepsy would exhibit fewer
seizures following ssri treatment via dietary ﬂuoxetine adulteration. in particular, potential
bioenergetic and neural mechanisms for anticonvulsant efﬁcacy of ﬂuoxetine were explored
using food intake/body weight monitoring and quantiﬁcation of brain serotonin transporter
protein. el mice consuming a chow diet ad libitum or yoked in quantity to ﬂuoxetine diet intake
exhibited seizure incidence of 40% in response to tail-suspension handling, whereas seizures
were abolished (0%) among el mice consuming a ﬂuoxetine-adultered diet over 7 days. a 3
day period of ﬂuoxetine administration was insufﬁcient to exert anticonvulsant efﬁcacy and
all treatment groups exhibited the same circadian locomotor activity patterns at the time of
seizure susceptibility testing. bioenergetic factors could not account for the anticonvulsant
efﬁcacy of ﬂuoxetine since yoked diet controls with matched food intake, body weight change
and blood glucose levels exhibited the same 40% seizure incidence as ad libitum chow controls.
importantly, the 7 day period of dietary ﬂuoxetine exposure was effective in selectively reducing cell density in the parietal cortex and increasing serotonin transporter protein content in
the nucleus accumbens. taken together, these results suggest that dietary ﬂuoxetine supplementation abolishes handling-induced seizure susceptibility in el mice via a neural remodeling
mechanism independent of energy balance.

while selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are a
ﬁrst line pharmacotherapy used to treat clinical depression
(dailey and naritoku, 1996), ﬂuoxetine and other antidepressants also exert anticonvulsant effects (hernandez et
al., 2002; ferrero et al., 2005; kecskemeti et al., 2005;
pericic et al., 2005; tupal and faingold, 2006). serotonergic signaling appears to have a direct role in modulating

seizure susceptibility as both 5-ht2c and  xxxg1117xxx  knockout
mice exhibit enhanced sensitivity to pentylenetetrazoleinduced convulsions (tecott et al., 1995; compan et al.,
2004). similarly, resting state levels of serotonin (5-ht) are
lower in seizure prone mice, as compared to 11 inbred
strains (king and lamotte, 1989). consistent with a causal
role for 5-ht deﬁciency in seizure incidence, administration
of 5-hydroxytrytophan (a 5-ht precursor) with mk-486 (a
peripheral decarboxylation inhibitor which limits 5-ht synthesis to the brain) increases brain 5-ht levels in seizure
prone mice, and signiﬁcantly decreases the occurrence
of seizures (hiramatsu, 1981). at the receptor level, the
 xxxg1108xxx  agonist, way100635, modiﬁes epileptic
activity depending on the type of seizure (lopez-meraz
et al., 2005). chronic treatment with ﬂuoxetine decreases
epileptic threshold in a manner correlated with levels of hippocampal glutamate release (ferrero et al., 2005) and ﬂuoxetine reduces spontaneous seizures in a model of temporal
lobe epilepsy (hernandez et al., 2002). this evidence suggests that serotonergic neurotransmission inhibits neuronal
network excitability (dailey et al., 1992) although consensus has been slow to develop on this point due to confusion
between manifestations of illness versus treatment effects
(jobe and browning, 2005). one aim of the present studies
was to provide a better understanding of the central mechanisms of action for the anticonvulsant effects of ﬂuoxetine.
the following experiments employed the ‘epilepsy’ (el)
mouse model to monitor seizure susceptibility after subchronic oral administration of the antidepressant ﬂuoxetine.
the el progenitor mouse resulted from a spontaneous mutation which was developed subsequently into the el strain
through selective breeding to maintain and amplify the
seizure prone phenotype (murashima et al., 2002). seizures
originate in the parietal cortex of el mice, and subsequently
spread to other brain regions such as the hippocampus
(ishida et al., 1993). the seizure locus may shift to the
hippocampus in seizure-experienced el mice (mutoh et al.,
1993) although this migration is a dynamic process dependent upon age and handling history (leussis and heinrichs,
in press). susceptibility to seizures in el mice increases
with age, and with repeated sensory stimulations involving tail-suspension, or ‘tossing-up’ (suzuki and nakamoto,
1982). the el mouse thus constitutes an animal model for
idiopathic complex partial seizures (seyfried and glaser,
1985; murashima et al., 2004), for temporal lobe epilepsy
(suzuki et al., 1983) and for simple reﬂex epilepsy (sarkisian,
2001). el mice are genetically predisposed to seize although
episodes are not intractable since pharmacological and
dietary studies have demonstrated the adult plasticity of
seizure susceptibility (heinrichs and seyfried, 2006). for
example, caffeine augments seizures in el mice by altering
the pharmacokinetics of a concurrently administered anticonvulsant drug (hashiguchi et al., 2001). similarly, high fat,
low carbohydrate ketogenic diet exposure exerts anticonvulsant effects in el mice (rho et al., 1999; seyfried et al.,
2004). these ﬁndings provide evidence that pharmacological and dietary interventions are capable of altering seizure
susceptibility in adult el mice.
in addition to antidepressant and anticonvulsant efﬁcacy
of ssris, drugs such as ﬂuoxetine also decrease symptoms
of anxiety, including social phobia, and impact bioenergetic
variables such as appetite, body weight and glucose avail-

ability (schatzberg, 2000). it is therefore noteworthy that
major characteristics of el mice which differentiate this
strain from controls include social withdrawal and low body
weight (mcfadyen-leussis and heinrichs, 2005; turner et
al., in press). antidepressants could then attenuate seizure
activity in el mice to the extent that enrichment of social
interactions exert anticonvulsant effects, a ﬁnding which
has been reported recently (schridde and van luijtelaar,
2005). similarly and in relation to energy balance, ﬂuoxetine is employed therapeutically in obese patients to achieve
weight loss (kordik and reitz, 1999). several studies provide evidence for linkage between brain mechanisms of
appetite regulation and seizure susceptibility since  xxxg1117xxx 
mutant mice, for example, exhibit dysregulation in both
arenas (compan et al., 2004). moreover, work with diabetic
mice reveals that ﬂuoxetine can alter blood glucose levels
which is an important consideration in prescribing antidepressant medication to diabetics (gomez et al., 2001). thus,
it will be important in the context of the present studies to
examine the potential role of ﬂuoxetine-induced changes in
appetite, body weight and glucose bioavailabililty on seizure
susceptibility in el mice.
no published study has examined anticonvulsant efﬁcacy
of ﬂuoxetine in el mice. while most animal studies employ
peripheral injection as the route of ssri drug administration (pericic et al., 2005), such a procedure is prohibitive
given the hyper-reactivity to handling exhibited by el mice
(heinrichs and seyfried, 2006). the present studies therefore employed oral self-administration via diet adulteration
as a means of long-term passive exposure to ﬂuoxetine.
regarding the effective anticonvulsant dose of the drug, ﬂuoxetine exerted a protective effect at 5 mg/kg in a limbic
motor seizure model, whereas in the genetically epilepsyprone rat the effective dose was 16 mg/kg (dailey et al.,
1996). additional studies found a 20 mg/kg dose of ﬂuoxetine to be effective in reducing pentylenetetrazole-induced
seizures (pericic et al., 2005), a 10 mg/kg dose to be effective in attenuating cocaine-induced seizures (macedo et al.,
2004) and a 25 mg/kg dose suppressed audiogenic seizure
severity (tupal and faingold, 2006). regarding the duration
of ﬂuoxetine exposure, one study showed that when ﬂuoxetine is administered repeatedly for 5 days, anticonvulsant
effects of a 20 mg/kg/day sub-chronic dose were equivalent to those exerted by an acute 20 mg/kg dose (pericic
et al., 2005). thus, the present studies employed an intermediate 10 mg/kg/day dose to examine the hypothesis that
oral administration of ﬂuoxetine over either 3 or 7 consecutive days would exert an anticonvulsant effect in seizure
susceptible el mice.

methods
animals
el mice were bred and maintained at boston college from stock
donated originally by dr. thomas seyfried. seizure susceptible el
mice (n = 57) were at least 6 months old at the time testing since
older mice of the el strain are more susceptible to seizures. seizure
phenotype in response to tail suspension handling for routine
husbandry was recorded for each cage of el mice after weaning
in order to achieve treatment group matching. animals had free
access to drinking water at all times and were fed ad libitum chow

(prolab3000, labdiets, richmond, in, usa) prior to the study. the
composition of the chow was 59.5% carbohydrate, 22% protein, 5%
fat, 11% ﬁber, and 2.5% added minerals. group housed mice were
re-housed singly 1 week prior to testing in a colony room with a
controlled temperature of 72 ◦ c, a humidity of 48%, and a 12-h
reverse light cycle (lights off 1000—2200). all experiments were
performed in accordance with the guidelines of the institutional
animal care and use committee of boston college.

around the perimeter of a standard mouse housing cage. four
infrared photocell beams located along the long axis and eight
beams across the width were positioned 2 cm above the bedding at
16 cm intervals. mice continued to consume their respective experimental diets and were tested in the locomotor apparatus for 24 h
following the hiss test.

chronic ﬂuoxetine self-administration

mice were anesthetized with the inhaled anesthetic isoﬂurane
(aerrane, baxter healthcare corporation, deerﬁeld, il) prior to
intracardial perfusion with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (pbs,
ph 7.4), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.9% saline. brains
were removed immediately and post-ﬁxed overnight at 4 ◦ c. brains
were placed in a 30% sucrose solution in pbs at 4 ◦ c until sinking (48—72 h). free-ﬂoating sections (40 ␮m) were obtained with
a cryostat, and stored in cryoprotectant (ph 7.2) at −20 ◦ c until
immunohistochemical analysis.

one experimental trial was completed over a 3 day span and three
trials were completed over a 7 day span. on day 1 of each trial, all
mice were weighed and singly housed in weight matched groups.
each mouse was provided with a pre-weighed food container with
a chow or ﬂuoxetine wet mash ration at the beginning of each 24 h
period. an additional empty cage was also employed for each of
the four trials to quantify evaporation per unit mass of wet mash
and so that this constant could be deducted from total daily food
intake. on subsequent days, the food containers were removed,
weighed and then reﬁlled with fresh food. mice in a yoked condition
were fed the average amount of food consumed by the ﬂuoxetine
group over the previous 24 h period. this procedure assured that
non-appetitive actions of ﬂuoxetine were responsible for anticonvulsion efﬁcacy, not simply food restriction, since the ﬂuoxetine
group consumed less than the ad libitum chow control group. all
feeding/weighing procedures were performed between 1000 and
1600 during the nocturnal portion of the circadian cycle when mice
were normally awake and active.

perfusion and tissue sectioning

blood glucose monitoring
just prior to intracardial perfusion, a sample of cardiac blood
was employed for assessing blood glucose levels at a single time
point 7 days following the beginning of ﬂuoxetine exposure and 2 h
following hiss testing. the truetrack smart system (home diagnostics, inc. fort lauderdale) employed amperametric technology
to quantify an oxidation reaction for real time blood glucose level
determinations. this device provides a 20—600 mg/dl range of sensitivity and a 3—5% intra-assay precision when assessing blood glucose
levels.

diet preparation
nissl staining
pelleted chow was blended to create a powder to which ﬂuoxetine
(spectrum chemical, gardena, ca) was added to yield a roughly
10 mg/kg/day dose of ﬂuoxetine based upon the initial body weight
and daily average food intake of experimental mice. water was
added to the dry mixture in order to create a wet mash that was
placed in the bottom of a cylindrical chamber in order to avoid
spillage. a ration of diet sufﬁcient to result in leftover food the following day was provided to each animal in the ad libitum treatment
groups.

handling-induced seizure susceptibility (hiss) test
on the ﬁnal day of diet exposure, a seizure susceptibility test was
performed in which mice were picked up by their tails and held
10—20 cm above the ﬂoor of the home cage for 30 s. mice were
then placed in a clean cage for 2 min and then lifted by the tail
for another 15 s before being returned to their home cage. behavioral characteristics of seizures in el mice are evident during three
speciﬁc phases: (1) prodromal: squeaking and transient immobility, followed by ‘‘running ﬁts’’, (2) ictal: convulsions starting with
the hind limbs but rapidly becoming generalized tonic-clonic, loss of
postural equilibrium, tail cocked over head (straub tail), salivation,
defecation, and urination and (3) post-ictal: lethargy, ‘‘kangaroo
posture’’ (sitting on hind legs with forepaws drawn up), turning of
the head in alternate directions, and occasional hyperirritability.
seizures were determined to have occurred in mice that exhibited
behavioral signs such as squeaking, tonic-clonic jerking, cocked tail
over the head, loss of posture and post-ictal ataxia. an all-or-none
criterion was employed in detecting seizures and no attempt was
made to score seizure severity.

locomotor activity test
the locomotor apparatus (san diego instruments) consisted of photocell grids, each measuring 25 cm × 48 cm, which were positioned

tissue sections were mounted onto gelatinized slides, rinsed in
ethanol and distilled water and then stained in 0.13% cresyl violet in an acetic acid buffer. stained slides were rinsed in ethanol,
cleared in xylene, and coverslipped.

serotonin transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ) immunohistochemistry
immunohistochemical detection of  xxxg2150xxx  protein was performed
using a primary antibody obtained from calbiochem (san carlos,
ca). after rinsing in 50% ethanol and quenching of endogenous
peroxidase activity with a 3%  xxxd2298xxx  solution, tissue
sections were placed in a 15% normal goat serum blocking solution. sections were incubated with the rabbit anti- xxxg2150xxx  antibody
(1:1000) overnight at 4 ◦ c. on the second day, sections were incubated with a goat, anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000) for 1 h
and then a streptavidin-hrp conjugate (abc kit) for 30 min (both
from vector laboratories, san carlos, ca). sections were stained
using a dab chromagen and a hematoxylin counterstain. immunohistochemical labeling was eliminated when either the primary or
secondary antibody was omitted from the assay.

brain mapping by microscopy
sections were photographed using an rt color spot camera (diagnostic instruments inc., sterling heights, mi) mounted on a zeiss
bright-ﬁeld microscope. nissl positive and  xxxg2150xxx  immunoreactive
cells were counted using the ip lab image analysis software (scanalytics, fairfax, va). in order to avoid potential experimenter and
laterality biases, analyses were completed without knowledge of
treatment condition using brain tissue from both sides of the sagittal
plane.
sites were selected for analysis based upon a series of cfos
mapping studies performed previously in el strain mice (mcfadyenleussis and heinrichs, 2004), by coarse examination for areas

22
of intense staining by a treatment-blind observer, and by the
known distribution of serotonin transporter protein in rodent brain
(cabrera-vera and battaglia, 1998). in particular, published electrophysiological and activity mapping studies have identiﬁed parietal
cortex as a likely source of seizures in the el brain (nakamoto et
al., 1990; ishida et al., 1993). based upon studies in our own laboratory suggesting that immediate-early gene expression emerges
in the parietal cortex of el brain early in development, the present
studies tested the a priori hypothesis that this known seizure locus
would by modulated by ﬂuoxetine exposure. moreover, sub-cortical
diencephalic and basal forebrain regions are reported to constitute brain sites for seizure facilitation and interactivity with other
brain seizure substrates (eells et al., 2004). in particular, published
studies demonstrate that active cells are more abundant in paraventricular thalamus after seizure induction (mraovitch and calando,
1999) and it has been suggested that recurring activation of the
paraventricular thalamus implies that this region stores memories of
previous, stress-related experiences (fenoglio et al., 2006). as the
el mouse model is known to be hyper-reactive to stressor exposure
(drage and heinrichs, 2005), the present studies tested the a priori
hypothesis that the paraventricular thalamus would be modulated
by ﬂuoxetine exposure. finally,  xxxg2150xxx  is enriched in brain areas
such as amygdala and nucleus accumbens which are reciprocally
connected and constitute sites vital for goal-directed responses and
plasticity (sur et al., 1996; stevenson and gratton, 2003). in preliminary studies, long-term ﬂuoxetine exposure was found to selectively
enhance  xxxg2150xxx  expression in the nucleus accumbens (unpublished
observations) and the present studies therefore tested the a priori
hypothesis that these brain regions would be modulated in el mice
by ﬂuoxetine exposure. thus, nissl and  xxxg2150xxx  labeled cells were
counted in the parietal cortex, paraventricular nucleus of thalamus, nucleus accumbens, and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala
of el mouse brain in the present studies. the selection of these four
brain regions of interest based upon the prior research ﬁndings just
described effectively reduces the likelihood that the present cell
density and activation measures would reﬂect non-speciﬁc actions
of systemically administered ﬂuoxetine. speciﬁc brain regions and
nuclei of interest were identiﬁed using a mouse brain atlas (paxinos
and franklin, 2001).

[f(2,12) = 4.5, p < 0.05] resulted from signiﬁcant loss of
body weight in the ﬂuoxetine-treated group relative to the

loss resulting from ﬂuoxetine treatment likely reﬂects
negative energy balance actions of the drug other than
appetite suppression (dubuc and peterson, 1990) since
mice in the yoked group ate the same quantity of food
over the 3 day trial without experiencing body weight loss.

statistical analysis
for all experiments, mixed factor analyses of variance (anova)
were performed for food intake, body weight, locomotor activity and local brain site cell density with treatment as a between
subjects factor and experimental hour or day as a within subjects factor. the 3 day trial employed n = 5 mice/treatment group
whereas the 7 day trial employed 12—15 mice/treatment group; a
subset of n = 4 mice was selected from each group in each trial for
histochemical analysis. simple main effect analyses were conducted
when appropriate to determine individual group differences, and
comparisons were considered signiﬁcant when p < 0.05. seizure frequency results were examined using non-parametric kruskal—wallis
tests.

short-term ﬂuoxetine-induced anorexia and body weight
loss did not impact susceptibility to handling-induced
seizures. examination of cell density assessed by nissl
staining in nucleus accumbens, paraventricular nucleus of
thalamus, amygdala and parietal cortex following a 3 day
period of exposure to ﬂuoxetine or chow diet treatments
revealed no signiﬁcant effects of condition (table 1).

seven day ﬂuoxetine self-administration trial
hiss testing after 7 days of dietary exposure revealed a relatively high rate of seizures in the two control groups: 40% (6
of 15) in the chow group and 42% (5 of 12) in the yoked group
relative to a signiﬁcantly (kruskal—wallis = 8.09, p < 0.02)
decreased 0% (0 of 15) in the ﬂuoxetine group (fig. 1).
analysis of food intake revealed a main effect of treatment
[f(2,41) = 43.8, p < 0.001] with mice in the ad libitum chow
group consuming more food than mice in the ﬂuoxetine and
yoked groups (fig. 3 ). moreover, animals in the ﬂuoxetine
and yoked groups lost signiﬁcantly [f(1,25) = 6.5, p < 0.005]
more body weight than the ad libitum chow control group
(fig. 3). mice in the three diet conditions were observed
to begin eating immediately after placement of the food
receptacle (chow, 65%; yoked, 44%; ﬂuoxetine, 67%) indicating that none of the diet conditions were aversive to the
extent that the animal would avoid the diets or the locations
in which they were served. these results demonstrate that a
7 day diet yoking procedure was effective in matching daily
food intake and body weight changes of mice not exposed
to ﬂuoxetine to those exhibited by the ad libitum ﬂuoxetine
group. analysis of locomotor activity revealed a signiﬁcant
main effect of time [f(23,598) = 7.4, p < 0.001] without an
effect of treatment. the effect of time reﬂects a circadian
activity rhythm in which mice are more active during the
nocturnal hours (fig. 4). these results suggest that consumption over 7 days of a ﬂuoxetine-adultered diet abolishes susceptibility to handling-induced seizures in el mice without
disrupting the normal proﬁle of circadian locomotor activity.

results suggest that a 7 day exposure to ﬂuoxetine-adultered

discussion
the main ﬁnding of the present studies is that a 7 day period
of dietary exposure to a 10 mg/kg/day dose of ﬂuoxetine was
effective in abolishing precipitated seizures in el mice. the
anticonvulsant effect of ﬂuoxetine was time-of-exposure
dependent in that a shorter 3 day trial demonstrated a high
60% seizure frequency in ﬂuoxetine-exposed el mice which
was comparable to the 40% seizure frequency of chow diet
controls. moreover, a yoked diet control group was used to
assess the alternative hypothesis that efﬁcacy of ﬂuoxetine
was dependent on diminished food intake and body weight
loss. the fact that 40% of yoked group mice seized in the 7
day trial documented that non-speciﬁc consequences of diet
restriction were not sufﬁcient to suppress seizure susceptibility in el mice. instead, the ability of ﬂuoxetine treatment
to enhance the serotonin transporter protein target for ssri
drugs in the basal forebrain and reduce cell density in a
cortical region implicated in seizure etiology in el mice
suggests that ﬂuoxetine attenuated seizures by remodeling

brain seizure susceptibility circuits. this conclusion is supported by the fact that the change in cortical cell density
produced by 7 day ﬂuoxetine exposure was not reproduced
by a 3 day period of ﬂuoxetine exposure. thus, changes produced by 7 day ssri treatment were neuroadaptive in nature
rather than simple non-speciﬁc, pharmacological effects of
exposure to the drug. future studies can test this hypothesis using local intra-cerebral administration of ﬂuoxetine
into the present candidate nuclei.
the weight of scientiﬁc evidence suggests that increasing
extracellular norepinephrine and/or serotonin by blockade
of the reuptake of these monoamines is the pharmacodynamic action responsible for the anticonvulsant effects
of antidepressants (dailey and naritoku, 1996; jobe and
browning, 2005). the present results support this claim
in that 1 week of exposure to a ﬂuoxetine-adultered diet
resulted in increased serotonin transporter protein content in the nucleus accumbens and a correlated elimination
of handling-induced seizures in genetically susceptible el
mice. while the serotonin transporter immunohistochemistry endpoint serves as an important manipulation check
in the present studies to insure that dietary ﬂuoxetine
exerted direct actions on serotonergic neurotransmission,
the ﬁnding of increased serotonin transporter content in
the nucleus accumbens may provide insight into the mech-

anism of seizure susceptibility in the el mouse model. brain
reward circuitry, which includes the nucleus accumbens as
a forebrain terminus of an affective regulatory pathway in
rodents (berridge, 1996), has been identiﬁed as one component of the seizure initiation pathway in the epileptic
brain (jobe and browning, 2005). in complementary fashion, the suspension of seizure susceptibility in el mice via
ﬂuoxetine exposure in the present studies supports the
contention that increasing serotonergic neurotransmission
serves as a ‘‘exterior defense shield’’ (jobe and browning,
2005) against tail suspension handling-induced convulsions
in el mice. similarly, evidence from neuroimaging studies
suggests that vagal nerve stimulation therapy for epilepsy
acts via brainstem serotonergic and noradrenergic projections to limbic and cortical structures that are involved in
mood regulation (nemeroff et al., 2006). given the fact that
the affective dysregulation proﬁle of el mice is robust and
varied with behavioral, neural and physiological components
(drage and heinrichs, 2005), future studies could pursue
the claimed comorbidity of epilepsy and affective disorders
(nemeroff et al., 2006) using this animal model.
it is well known that clinically relevant dietary restriction or provision of alternative diets exert anticonvulsive
effects in animal models of epilepsy including the el mouse
(stafstrom and bough, 2003; mantis et al., 2004; seyfried et

al., 2004). an autonomous anticonvulsant mechanism based
entirely on nutritional change is potentially troublesome
in the present studies for two reasons: (1) ﬂuoxetine was
administered via diet adulteration in the present studies
such that attempts to self-regulate intake of the drug also
impact food intake and vice versa and (2) ﬂuoxetine facilitates serotonergic neurotransmission which is well known to
alter appetite and body weight in multiple species (heisler
et al., 1997; harvey and bouwer, 2000). the oral route of
ﬂuoxetine self-administration was selected for the present
studies since the el mouse phenotype of stress hyperreactivity is prohibitive for daily systemic or parenteral
administration procedures of the sort typically employed for
chronic administration of ﬂuoxetine in rodents (kecskemeti
et al., 2005; pericic et al., 2005). in particular, such drug
administration procedures are stressful in and of themselves
(balcombe et al., 2004) and would be expected either to
trigger seizures in el mice or to produce a seizure refractory period which would reduce hiss test sensitivity. in
addition, several procedures were employed in the present
studies to guard against potential non-speciﬁc appetitive
actions of ﬂuoxetine on seizure susceptibility. first, mice
in the various treatment groups were weight matched prior
to beginning the experimental trials. second, a diet yoking
procedure insured that this control group would exhibit the

26
same changes in food intake as ﬂuoxetine self-administering
mice. third, a post-mortem blood glucose measure was
employed to assess this bioenergetic component on the
day of seizure susceptibility testing. finally, a behavioral
measure of motivation to eat was employed to assess the
eagerness of mice in the various treatment groups to seek
out their daily dietary ration. the home cage measure of
immediate eating revealed that a signiﬁcant proportion of
mice in all three diet groups including the ﬂuoxetine group
were eager to come into contact with the food dish and
begin eating without delay. this suggests that there were no
general motivational confounds in ﬂuoxetine-treated mice
and this conclusion was supported by the lack of effect
of ﬂuoxetine on overall home cage motor activity beginning at the time of seizure susceptibility testing. finally,
single time point resting blood glucose levels were equivalent among the three dietary groups at the time of seizure
susceptibility testing. taken together with the lack of prophylaxis observed for seizure susceptibility in the yoked diet
group, these results suggest that non-speciﬁc bioenergetic
variables are not able to account for anticonvulsant efﬁcacy
of ﬂuoxetine in the present studies.
the present results add the el mouse to the growing list of
animal models of epilepsy in which ﬂuoxetine has been found
to exert anticonvulsant actions (dailey et al., 1996; macedo
et al., 2004; ugale et al., 2004; kecskemeti et al., 2005;
pericic et al., 2005). one mechanism for reduced seizure frequency in el mice treated with ﬂuoxetine may be remodeling
of the somatosensory region of the parietal cortex which has
been identiﬁed previously as a seizure trigger zone (ishida
et al., 1993; murashima et al., 1996). however, the present
results also support an alternative hypothesis that protective serotonergic circuits in affective regulatory regions of
the brain serve as seizure modulators. consistent with the
later alternative, high emotionality characteristics of the el
mouse separate from seizure susceptibility also suggest efﬁcacy of ﬂuoxetine. for example, el mice are hyper-reactive
to stressor exposure (drage and heinrichs, 2005), exhibit an
anxiogenic-like phenotype in response to novelty (pascual
and heinrichs, in press), and these characteristics could
potentially be ameliorated by the anxiolytic efﬁcacy of ﬂuoxetine (silva and brandao, 2000). similarly, el mice exhibit
social withdrawal (turner et al., in press) and an impairment in social recognition memory (lim et al., in press) and
these behavioral and cognitive deﬁciencies are reported to
be normalized by ﬂuoxetine (el hage et al., 2004). future
studies can address whether seizure protective effects of
ﬂuoxetine in el mice extend into other realms of affective
or anti-social psychopathology.
