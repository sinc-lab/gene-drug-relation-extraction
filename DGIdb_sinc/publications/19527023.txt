abstract:  xxxd2563xxx  (2- xxxd2563xxx ), also known as  xxxd2563xxx , is the synthetic precursor

of all the naturally occurring  xxxd3522xxx  in the body.  xxxd3522xxx  is necessary for the production of prothrombin
and five other blood-clotting factors in humans. we have examined the effects of  xxxd2563xxx  on cellular
microtubules ex vivo as well as its binding with purified tubulin and microtubules in vitro. cell viability
experiments using human cervical epithelial cancer cells (hela) and human oral epithelial cancer cells (kb)
indicated that the ic50 values for  xxxd2563xxx  are 25.6 ( 0.6 and 64.3 ( 0.36 mum, respectively, in those cells.
mendione arrests hela cells in mitosis. immunofluorescence studies using an anti-r-tubulin antibody
showed a significant irreversible depolymeriztion of the interphase microtubule network and spindle
microtubule in a dose-dependent manner. in vitro polymerization of purified tubulin into microtubules is
inhibited by  xxxd2563xxx  with an ic50 value of 47 ( 0.65 mum. the binding of  xxxd2563xxx  with tubulin was
studied using  xxxd2563xxx  fluorescence and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of tubulin. binding of  xxxd2563xxx 
to tubulin is slow, taking 35 min for equilibration at 25 °c. the association reaction kinetics is biphasic in
nature, and the association rate constants for fast and slow phases are 189.12 ( 17 and 32.44 ( 21 m-1 s-1 at
25 °c, respectively. the stoichiometry of  xxxd2563xxx  binding to tubulin is 1:1 (molar ratio) with a dissociation
constant from 2.44 ( 0.34 to 3.65 ( 0.25 mum at 25 °c.  xxxd2563xxx  competes for the colchicine binding site with
a ki of 2.5 mum as determined from a modified dixon plot. the obtained data suggested that  xxxd2563xxx  binds
at the colchicine binding site to tubulin. thus, we can conclude one novel mechanism of inhibition of cancer
cell proliferation by  xxxd2563xxx  is through tubulin binding.

 xxxd3522xxx  is an essential vitamin that was discovered as a fatsoluble anti-hemorrhagic agent (1). the k vitamins act as
cofactors during post-translation modification at specific glutamate residues of the blood-clotting proteins, factors ii, vii, ix, x,
protein c, and  xxxg1850xxx , which are active forms of clotting
factors (1-4).  xxxd3522xxx  consists of a family of structurally
similar fat-soluble 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinones, including phylloquinone (vitamin k1), menaquinone (vitamin k2), and  xxxd2563xxx  ( xxxd2563xxx ). all members of the  xxxd3522xxx  family possess
an identical naphthoquinone skeleton with various side chains that
distinguish them. vitamin k1 is found in many higher plants as
well as algae, with the highest concentrations found in green leafy
vegetables (5). vitamin k2 also occurs naturally but is not
produced by plants. it is produced by a vast array of intestinal
bacteria (6).  xxxd2563xxx  ( xxxd2563xxx ) is not considered a natural

 xxxd3522xxx , but rather a synthetic analogue that acts as a
provitamin, and the pharmacological dosages of phylloquinone
and menaquinones (menaquinone-4 and -7) are catabolized to
release  xxxd2563xxx ; only upon oral administration of  xxxd3522xxx 
had ∼5-25% of the ingested k vitamins been catabolized to
 xxxd2563xxx  (7). it possesses a much simpler structure, with no
aliphatic chain prosthetic group at position 3. the antitumor
action of  xxxd3522xxx  has been under investigation since 1947 (8),
and most of the anticancer research of  xxxd3522xxx  has been focused
on  xxxd2563xxx  (9). the anticancer activity of  xxxd2563xxx  has also
been demonstrated in a number of studies using both rodent and
human cancer cell lines (10-14).  xxxd2563xxx  was effective against
multi-drug-resistant leukemia cell lines and parental leukemia cell
lines (15). several mechanisms have been proposed in the growth
inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of  xxxd2563xxx . historically, the
main effect is believed to be due to oxidative stress via redox
cycling of the quinone to produce reactive oxygen species (16),
while a lower concentration of  xxxd2563xxx  induces apoptosis by a
nonoxidative mechanism (17). in hepatocytes,  xxxd2563xxx  increases the level of  xxxg418xxx , which induces the cell cycle to g0/
g1 arrest (18, 19), but it was also reported that  xxxd2563xxx  induces
g2/m arrest by inhibition of formation of the cyclinb-cdk1
complex in hepatic cancer cells (20).

microtubules are major structural components of the cytoskeleton of the cell and play important roles in cell motility,
intracellular transport, mitosis, and many other cellular processes (21-25). highly dynamic microtubules are among the
most successful targets for anticancer therapy that inhibit mitosis
in mammalian cells by interfering with the rapid dynamics of the
spindle microtubules, which are required for normal mitotic
progression (26). they are dynamic polymers composed of
r- and  xxxg2353xxx  heterodimer. drugs which bind to the tubulin-microtubule system alter its dynamics in two different ways,
either by stabilizing the polymer structure of microtubules like
paclitaxel or by inhibiting the polymerization of tubulin into
microtubules (26-33). there are two characterized drug-binding
sites in tubulin that inhibit microtubule polymerization. one is
the colchicine binding site in r- and  xxxg2353xxx  interphase, where
drugs such as colchicine itself,  xxxd2980xxx , combreastatin,
and curacin a are thought to bind (26-30). the second is the
vinca binding site, also thought to be in  xxxg2353xxx , where the
vinca alkaloids, cryptophycins, and maytansinoids bind (31).
 xxxd2563xxx  blocks mitosis and inhibits cell proliferation, but
whether it has any effect on microtubule dynamics has not been
determined. in this study, we examined the binding activity of
 xxxd2563xxx  with tubulin and microtubules. we found that in vitro
 xxxd2563xxx   xxxd1740xxx  at the colchicine binding site and
inhibits microtubule polymerization.  xxxd2563xxx  binding to
tubulin enhances  xxxd2563xxx  fluorescence and quenches the
tryptophan fluorescence of tubulin.  xxxd2563xxx  exhibits cytotoxicity in human cervical carcinoma cells (hela) and human
oropharyngeal carcinoma cells (kb) under ex vivo conditions.
we also found that in ex vivo perturbation of interphase and
spindle microtubules in human cervical carcinoma cells (hela)
by  xxxd2563xxx , it induces g2/m arrest in the hela cell cycle. the
results indicate a novel mechanism of cell proliferation inhibition
and mitotic block by  xxxd2563xxx , and it could be beneficial for the
development of potential anticancer agents.

nitrogen and stored at -70 °c. the protein concentration was
estimated by the method of bradford (35) using bovine serum
albumin as the standard.
preparation of the  xxxd2563xxx  solution. the stock solution
of  xxxd2563xxx  was prepared by adding dry powder of  xxxd2563xxx 
to 100% dmso. the concentration was determined using the
molar extinction coefficient of 3100 m-1 cm-1 at 340 nm in
ethanol (39). all the experiments were conducted making the
secondary solution in pem buffer where the final dmso
concentration is less than 1%.
cell culture. human cervical carcinoma cells (hela) and
human oropharyngeal carcinoma cells (kb) were maintained in
nutrient mixture dmem supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine,
10% fetal bovine serum, 50 mug/ml penicillin, 50 mug/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 mug/ml  xxxd164xxx . cells were cultured at
37 °c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% co2. cells were
grown in tissue culture flasks until they were 80% confluent
before trypsinization with 1 trypsin-versene and splitting. the
morphology of normal and treated cells was observed with an
olympus model ckx41 inverted microscope.
cell proliferation inhibition assay (mtt assay). cultured hela and kb cells were plated in 96-well culture plates (1 
104 cells per well). after incubation for 24 h, the cells were treated
with  xxxd2563xxx  (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 mum) for 12 h. mtt
(5 mg/ml) was dissolved in pbs and filter sterilized, and then
20 mul of the prepared solution was added to each well. this was
incubated until a purple precipitate was visible. subsequently,
100 mul of triton-x was added and incubated in the well in the
dark for 2 h at room temperature. the absorbance was measured
on an elisa reader (multiskanex, lab systems, helsinki,
finland) at a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference
wavelength of 650 nm. data were calculated as the percentage
of inhibition by the following formula:

flow cytometric analysis for apoptotic and necrotic
cells. to examine the presence of apoptosis and necrosis
induced by  xxxd2563xxx , 1  105 hela cells were cultured with
different concentrations of  xxxd2563xxx  for 24 h. as a control,
hela cells were cultured without  xxxd3522xxx . approximately 1 
105 cells were then stained for 15 min at room temperature in the
dark with fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-conjugated annexin
v (1 mug/ml) and pi (0.5 mug/ml) in a ca2þ-enriched binding
buffer and analyzed by a two-color flow cytometric assay.
 xxxg166xxx  and pi emissions were detected in the fl1 and  xxxd752xxx 
channels of a facscalibur flow cytometer, using emission filters
at 525 and 575 nm, respectively. the  xxxg166xxx -negative/pinegative population was regarded as normal and healthy, while
 xxxg166xxx -positive/pi-negative and  xxxg166xxx -positive/pi-positive cells were taken as a measure of apoptosis and necrosis,
respectively. apoptosis analysis was performed using the becton
dickinson facscan instrument, and the data were analyzed
using cellquest from becton dickinson.
cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. hela cells were
seeded at a density of 3  104 cells/ml.  xxxd2563xxx  (25 mum) was
added and was incubated for 18 h. after 18 h, the cells were
harvested, fixed in ice chilled methanol for at least 30 min at 4 °c,
and incubated for 4 h at 37 °c in a pbs solution containing 1 mg/
ml  xxxg1963xxx . cell cycle analysis was performed using the becton

materials. nutrient mixture dulbecco’s minimal essential
medium (supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine), fetal bovine
serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and  xxxd164xxx  were purchased from hyclone. trypsin-versene was purchased from
cambrex bioscience.  xxxd2563xxx  ( xxxd2563xxx ), phylloquinone
(vitamin k1), dapi,1 anti-mouse monoclonal anti-r-tubulin
antibody (raised in mice), anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated
igg antibody, guanosine 50 -triphosphate (gtp), pipes, mgcl2,

apoptosis detection kit was obtained from bd biosciences
(san diego, ca). the bradford protein estimation kit was from
genei. all other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade
and were purchased from sisco research laboratories.
purification of tubulin from goat brain. tubulin was
isolated from goat brain via two cycles of temperature-dependent
assembly and disassembly in pem buffer containing 50 mm
pipes, 1 mm egta, and 0.5 mm mgcl2 (ph 6.9) in the
presence of 1 mm gtp, followed by two more cycles in 1 m

mitotic progression. to evaluate mitotic indices, hela cells
were plated at a density of 3 104 cells/ml. after 48 h, cells were
incubated in the absence or presence of  xxxd2563xxx  over a range
of concentrations (10-25 mum) for 20 h. media were collected,
and cells were rinsed with pbs twice, detached by trypsinization,
and added back to the media to ensure that floating and poorly
attached mitotic cells were included in the analysis. cells were
fixed with 10% formalin for 30 min, permeabilized in ice-cold
methanol for 10 min, and stained with 40 ,60 -diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) (1 mug/ml) to visualize nuclei. mitotic indices were
determined with a ziess lsm 510 meta confocal microscope.
results are the means and standard error of the mean (sem) of
three experiments in each of which 500 cells were counted at each
concentration (32).
sample preparation for confocal microscopy. human
cervical epithelial carcinoma cells (hela) were seeded on coverslips at a density of 1 105 cells/ml and incubated in the presence
of different doses of  xxxd2563xxx  (0-50 mum) for 18 h. subsequently, cells were washed twice with pbs washing buffer, and
cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. cell permeable
solution (0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% triton) was added,
and cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with
5% bsa. cells were then incubated with anti-mouse monoclonal
anti-r-tubulin antibody (1:200 dilution) followed by anti-mouse
rhodamine-conjugated igg antibody (1:150 dilutions) and dapi
(1 mug/ml). after incubation, cells were washed with pbs and
viewed under a ziess lsm 510 meta confocal microscope.
western blot analysis. the cellular tubulin polymerization
was quantified by a modified method which was originally
described by minotti et al. (33). cultured hela cells were treated
with different concentrations of  xxxd2563xxx  (25-50 mum) and
colchicine (3 mum) for 18 h. then the cells were washed twice with
pbs and harvested by trypsinization. cells were lysed at 37 °c for
5 min in the dark with 100 mul of hypotonic lysis buffer [1 mm
mgcl2, 2 mm egta, 0.5% np-40, 20 mug/ml aprotinin, 20 mug/ml
leupeptin, 1 mm orthovanadate, 2 mm pmsf, and 20 mm trishcl (ph 6.8)]. after a brief but vigorous vortex, the samples were
centrifuged at 14000 rpm (21000g) for 10 min. the 100 mul
supernatants containing soluble (cytosolic) tubulin were separated from the pellets containing polymerized (cytoskeletal)
tubulin. the pellets were resuspended in 100 mul of lysis buffer.
the total concentrations of proteins in the soluble fraction and
pellet fraction were estimated separately by the bradford method.
equal amounts (50 mug) of each sample were added with sdspolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and run in a
10% sds-polyacrylamide gel. the sample was then analyzed by
western blotting and probed with the antibody against r-tubulin
(1:1000 dilutions).
microtubule polymerization. tubulin (1.2 mg/ml) was
mixed with different concentrations of  xxxd2563xxx  (0-80 mum)
and incubated for 30 min at 25 °c. the polymerization reaction
was initiated by incubating the tubulin- xxxd2563xxx  complex in
polymerization buffer [1 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1 mm egta, and 1.0 m
monosodium glutamate (ph 6.8)] at 37 °c just after addition of
1 mm gtp to the assembly. the rate and the extent of the
polymerization reaction were monitored by light scattering at 350
nm using a jasco v-630 spectrophotometer (37).

binding study by fluorometric titration. association
kinetics. the kinetics of the association of  xxxd2563xxx  with
tubulin was measured under pseudo-first-order conditions, where
the ligand was present in a large excess using a hitachi model
f-3010 fluorescence spectrophotometer. concentrations of  xxxd2563xxx  were 20, 30, and 40 mum, whereas the tubulin concentration was 1 mum (39). the ligand was added to the tubulin solution,
and emission at 336 nm was measured upon excitation at 295 nm
(excitation and emission slits were 5 and 10 nm, respectively). the
quenching data were analyzed according using lambier and
engelborgh’s method (39, 40) after correction for the inner filter
effect.

where f is the fluorescence of the ligand-tubulin complex at time

respectively, k1 and k2 are the pseudo-first-order rate constants
for these fast and slow phases, respectively, and c is an integration constant. the data were analyzed with microcal origin
version 7.0. the apparent second-order rate constant (kon) was
obtained by dividing the observed rate constant for the fast phase
(k1) and the slow phase (k2) by the ligand concentration.
enhancement of the fluorescence of the ligand upon its
binding to tubulin. the increased  xxxd2563xxx  fluorescence at
418 nm upon its binding to tubulin was observed. initial
experiments showed that the increase in  xxxd2563xxx  fluorescence
upon its binding to tubulin attained saturation after incubation
for 20 min at 25 °c.  xxxd2563xxx  (5 mum) showed its fluorescence
enhancement upon incubation with 0-25 mum tubulin in 25 mm
pipes (ph 6.8), 3 mm  xxxd2534xxx , and 1 mm egta (buffer a) at
25 °c for 30 min. the excitation and emission wavelengths were
340 and 418 nm, respectively. the apparent increases in the
fluorescence values in the presence of varying concentrations of
tubulin corrected for the inner filter effect were determined
according to eq 2. binding parameters were determined using
the relationship deltafmax/delta(f - fo) = kd/[free  xxxd2563xxx ] þ 1,
where kd corresponds to the dissociation constant, delta(f - fo) is
the change in fluorescence intensity when tubulin and  xxxd2563xxx 
are in equilibrium, and deltafmax is the value of maximum fluorescence change when tubulin is completely liganded with  xxxd2563xxx . deltafmax was calculated by plotting 1/delta(f - fo) versus 1/
[ xxxd2563xxx ], using the total ligand concentration as a first estimate
of free ligand concentration, and the calculation was repeated until
there was no change in the value of the deltafmax (40, 41).
job plot. the stoichiometry of binding was determined using
the method of continuous variation (42). several mixtures of
tubulin and  xxxd2563xxx  were prepared by continuously varying
concentrations of tubulin and  xxxd2563xxx  in the mixture, keeping
the total concentration of  xxxd2563xxx  with tubulin constant at
5 mum. reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 25 °c, and

equilibrium constant. tubulin (2 mum) was incubated with
varying concentrations of  xxxd2563xxx  (0-30 mum) at 25 °c for
30 min. the fluorescence measurements were performed using
295 nm as the excitation wavelength, and the wavelength scan
was conducted between 310 and 400 nm. we selected 295 nm as
the excitation wavelength to specifically excite the tubulin
tryptophan residues. when excited at 295 nm, tubulin displayed
a typical emission spectrum with a maximum at 335 nm, and
 xxxd2563xxx  reduced the intrinsic fluorescence of tubulin. the
apparent decreases in the fluorescence values in the presence of
varying concentrations of  xxxd2563xxx  were corrected for the inner
filter effect according to eq 1. the fraction of binding sites (x)
occupied by  xxxd2563xxx  was determined using the equation x =
(fo - f)/fmax, where fo is the fluorescence intensity of tubulin in
the absence of  xxxd2563xxx , f is the corrected fluorescence
intensity of tubulin in the presence of  xxxd2563xxx , and fmax is
calculated from the plot of 1/(fo - f) versus 1/[ xxxd2563xxx ] and
extrapolating 1/[ xxxd2563xxx ] to zero. the dissociation constant
(kd) was determined using the relationship fmax/(fo - f) =1 þ
kd/lf, where lf represents the free  xxxd2563xxx  concentration, and
lf=c - x[y], where c is total concentration of  xxxd2563xxx  and
[y] is the molar concentration of ligand binding sites, using a
stoichiometry of 1:1 as determined from the job plot.
effect of  xxxd2563xxx  on the formation of the colchicine-tubulin complex. colchicine binding to tubulin was
assessed by measuring the fluorescence of the tubulin-colchicine
complex (43). a modified dixon plot for the  xxxd2563xxx  was
obtained using colchicine as a competitive inhibitor. the reaction
mixtures containing tubulin (3 mum) and varied concentrations of
colchicine (5-15 mum) and  xxxd2563xxx  (0-75 mum) were incubated
at 37 °c for 45 min. the reciprocal of the fluorescence intensity of
the colchicine tubulin complex at 430 nm was plotted versus the
concentration of the  xxxd2563xxx , while the excitation wavelength
was 380 nm. the resulting dixon plot gave an approximate
ki value for the  xxxd2563xxx  (44).
statistical analysis. data are presented as the mean of at
least three independent experiments along with sem. statistical
analysis of data was conducted by a student’s t test, by using ms
excel, and two measurements were statistically significant if the
corresponding p value was <0.05.

 xxxd2563xxx  inhibits proliferation of kb and hela cells.
 xxxd2563xxx  inhibited proliferation of human cervical carcinoma
(hela) and human oropharyngeal carcinoma (kb) cell lines in a
concentration-dependent manner as measured by mtt assay
(figure 1b,c) (explained in experimental procedures). maximal
proliferation inhibition in the case of hela cells was observed at
24 h with 75 mum  xxxd2563xxx , which inhibited 92.35% proliferation with the calculated ic50 value of 25.6 ( 0.6 mum, whereas in
kb cells, the maximum proliferation inhibition was observed at
24 h with 100 mum  xxxd2563xxx , which inhibited 83.70% proliferation. the ic50 value of in kb cells is 64.3 ( 0.36 mum.
 xxxd2563xxx  induces apoptosis in hela cells. to quantify
the mode of cell death (apoptosis or necrosis) induced by
 xxxd2563xxx , hela cells were incubated in the absence and
presence of 10, 25, and 50 mum  xxxd2563xxx  for 24 h. cells were
then stained with  xxxg166xxx  and pi and analyzed by flow
cytometry.  xxxg166xxx -positive/pi-negative cells were taken as

experiment are given in experimental procedures.

a measure of apoptosis. as shown in figure 2a,  xxxd2563xxx 
induced apoptosis of hela cells. the ratios of apoptotic cells
were 24.57, 44.09, and 66.45% when the cells were treated with
10, 25, and 50 mum  xxxd2563xxx , respectively, while it was only
0.51% when the cells were cultured without  xxxd2563xxx . the
increased fluorescence of the fitc- xxxg166xxx -positive apoptotic
cells was observed by confocal microscope with respect to
nonapoptotic control cells (figure 2b). these results clearly
indicated that  xxxd2563xxx  induces apoptosis in hela cells.
 xxxd2563xxx  induces g2/m cell cycle arrest of hela
cells. to examine the mechanism responsible for menadionemediated cell growth inhibition, cell cycle distribution was analyzed using a flow cytometric method as shown in figure 3a. the
ratios of untreated cells in g0/g1, s, and g2/m phases of the cell
cycle were 41.3, 7.37, and 18.16%, respectively, and in the presence
of 0.5 mum paclitaxel (used as a positive control), the ratios were
10.59, 11.79, and 44.82%, respectively. in the presence of 25 mum
 xxxd2563xxx , the ratios of g0/g1, s, and g2/m became 12.89, 7.76,
and 50.34%, respectively, resulting in a clear increase in the
percentage of cells in the g2/m phase compared to that of
untreated cells, and are comparable with those of paclitaxeltreated cells, and this indicates that  xxxd2563xxx  arrests the hela
cell cycle at the g2/m phase.
determination of the mitotic index of  xxxd2563xxx -treated hela cells. to further determine whether  xxxd2563xxx 
inhibited cell cycle progression in mitosis, the mitotic indices of
normal and  xxxd2563xxx -treated hela cells were calculated by
confocal microscopy after fixing and staining of cells (details in
experimental procedures). in the absence of  xxxd2563xxx , 4.5% of
hela cells were in mitosis; after the addition of  xxxd2563xxx , as
cells entered the m phase of the cell cycle, many of them were
unable to progress through mitosis, and they began to accumulate in mitosis (figure 3b,c and table 1). many of the cells that
were not blocked in mitosis were in an abnormal multinucleate
interphase and may have undergone an abortive mitosis and
reverted to interphase without successful cytokinesis (figure 3b).
again, the percentage of cells in mitosis was increased after
treatment of hela cells with  xxxd2563xxx  for 18 h in a concentration-dependent manner (figure 3c). in the presence 10 and
25 mum  xxxd2563xxx , 22 and 42% of total cells were in mitosis,

respectively. table 1 also lists the distribution of the cell in different
mitotic phases, where it is evident that cells are mainly blocked on
the prophase/prometaphase and metaphase, whereas the arrest of
anaphase and telophase is comparatively weaker. together, all
data indicated that  xxxd2563xxx  arrests hela cells in mitosis.
disruption of the interphase microtubule network of
hela cells by  xxxd2563xxx . because the tubulin-microtubule
system has a major role in the maintenance of cellular integrity
and because  xxxd2563xxx  induced apoptosis and arrest of mitosis
in hela cells, we were interested to know whether  xxxd2563xxx 
targets the microtubule network in cultured hela cells. this was
examined by confocal microscopy, and the results are shown in
figure 4a-f. control hela cells exhibited typical interphase
microtubule organization (figure 4a,b). no effect of  xxxd2563xxx 
on the interphase microtubule network was apparent at  xxxd2563xxx  concentrations below 10 mum. however, at relatively higher
 xxxd2563xxx  concentrations (25 mum), a significant reduction in
microtubule density occurred (figure 4c,d). a substantial
reduction in the number of microtubules at the periphery of
the cells was apparent, and the central networks were disorganized.  xxxd2563xxx  depolymerized interphase microtubules
greatly in hela cells at 50 mum (figure 4e,f).
 xxxd2563xxx  perturbs mitotic spindle organization. in
untreated cells, normal bipolar spindles were observed with
chromosomes congressed in the form of compact metaphase
plates. effects of  xxxd2563xxx  on the spindle microtubules of hela
cells are shown in figure 4g-l.  xxxd2563xxx  depolymerized
spindle microtubules in a concentration-dependent manner. in
the presence of 10 and 25 mum  xxxd2563xxx , the chromosomes were
unable to organize in the metaphase plate. these results indicated

that  xxxd2563xxx  may inhibit microtubule polymerization and
reduce the microtubule density in the cytoplasm.
 xxxd2563xxx  reduces the polymerized microtubule mass
in hela cells. to quantify the effect of  xxxd2563xxx  on microtubule mass in hela cells, western blot analyses were performed
for the soluble tubulin and the assembled tubulin of hela cells
after treatment with  xxxd2563xxx  against anti-r-tubulin antibody.
as shown in figure 4m, the level of soluble tubulin in  xxxd2563xxx -treated cells was decreased compared to that in control
cells (untreated cells). cells treated with 25 and 50 mum  xxxd2563xxx 
also showed a decreased amount of the polymer form of tubulin
(figure 4m, lanes 2 and 3), while the total amount of tubulin
remains unchanged. these results show a pattern similar to that
of colchicine, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent (positive control, lane 4, figure 4m).
 xxxd2563xxx  irreversibly depolymerizes microtubules in
hela cells. drugs like  xxxd1831xxx  depolymerize microtubules
reversibly; on removal of the drug, the formation of new
microtubules or repolymerization of microtubules takes place
in cells (45). to determine whether  xxxd2563xxx  had the same
effect, we incubated the hela cells with the ic50 concentration of
 xxxd2563xxx  (25 mum) for 18 h, then washed off the menadionecontaining medium, washed the cells thrice with fresh pbs, and
finally replaced the fresh medium and placed the cells in a 37 °c
incubator for different periods of time (0-24 h). finally, we
viewed them under a confocal microscope, and no significant
repolymerization of the microtubule network was observed
(figure 5), which suggests the irreversible pattern of damage of
the microtubule network by menadiones like cryptophycin and
sanguinarin (46, 47).

(becton dickinson). here m1, m2, m3, and m4 indicate sub-g0, g0/g1, s, and g2/m phase, respectively. (b) effect of  xxxd2563xxx  on
chromosomes of hela cells. cultured hela cells were fixed and stained with dapi (1 mug/ml) for the observation of chromosomes in different
stages of mitosis; also, normal and abnormal interphase nuclei are observed in the absence (control cells) and in the presence of  xxxd2563xxx  (1025 mum) for 18 h. details of the experiment are given in experimental procedures. (c) effect of  xxxd2563xxx  on mitosis in hela cells. cultured hela
cells were treated with 0-25 mum  xxxd2563xxx  for 18 h. cells were then fixed and stained with dapi (1 mug/ml). mitotic indices were determined by
counting interphase and mitotic cells at 40 magnification using a confocal microscope. at least 1000 cells per data point were counted. data are
presented as means ( sem (p < 0.01) where n = 3.

 xxxd2563xxx  suppresses reassembly of cold depolymerized microtubules in hela cells. microtubules were depolymerized when the hela cells were incubated at 4 °c for 3 h (until
the cell appeared round), as shown in figure 6b. subsequently,
the kinetics of the reassembly of the microtubules in live hela
cells was monitored by incubating the cells with warm medium
containing different concentrations of  xxxd2563xxx  at 37 °c. in
control cells, depolymerized interphase microtubules reassembled to form a normal microtubule network within 60 min
of incubation at 37 °c (figure 6c). in the presence of 10, 25, and
50 mum  xxxd2563xxx , microtubules failed to reassemble even after

incubation for 60 min at 37 °c (figure 6c-e). in the absence of
 xxxd2563xxx , spindle microtubules assembled fast and formed
normal mitotic spindles (figure 6i). in the presence of 10, 25,
and 50 mum  xxxd2563xxx , spindle reassembly was hindered
(figure 6j,k) and it was not detectable in cells treated with
50 mum  xxxd2563xxx  (figure 6m).
inhibition of microtubule polymerization by  xxxd2563xxx 
in vitro. since we have already noticed that  xxxd2563xxx  affects
the cellular architecture of human cervical carcinoma (hela)
cells by perturbing the intercellular microtubular network, we
examined the effect of  xxxd2563xxx  on microtubule polymerization

figure 4: (a-f) effects of  xxxd2563xxx  on the interphase microtubules of hela cells. cells were incubated with 0, 10, 25, and 50 mum  xxxd2563xxx 
for 18 h. microtubules tagged with rhodamine (red) and nuclei tagged with dapi (blue) were visualized with a confocal microscope as described in
experimental procedures. (g-l) effects of  xxxd2563xxx  on spindle microtubule and chromosome organization of the hela cells. hela cells were
grown in the absence and presence of 10 and 25 mum  xxxd2563xxx  for 18 h. the spindle microtubule was tagged with rhodamine (red), and the
chromosomal arrangement was tagged with dapi (blue). details of the experiment are given in experimental procedures. (m) effect of
 xxxd2563xxx  on tubulin polymerization in hela cells. hela cells were treated with 0, 25, and 50 mum  xxxd2563xxx  over an 18 h period. cells were lysed
with a hypotonic lysis buffer. following cell lysis, the polymerized and soluble form of tubulins was separated by centrifugation. western blot
analysis was conducted using an antibody against r-tubulin.

using purified tubulin. we first analyzed the ability of  xxxd2563xxx 
to inhibit polymerization of purified tubulin into microtubules in
vitro by the light scattering assay (as explained in experimental
procedures). purified tubulin (12 mum) was polymerized in the
absence or presence of different concentrations of  xxxd2563xxx ,
and the results of such experiments are shown in figure 7a.
 xxxd2563xxx  inhibited the rate and extent of tubulin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner (figure 7b). for
example, the level of inhibition of polymerization was 74% when
80 mum  xxxd2563xxx  was added. the percentage inhibition of
microtubule polymerization was calculated using the absorbance
readings in the absence and presence of different concentrations
of  xxxd2563xxx  (figure 5b), and 50% inhibition of microtubule
polymerization (ic50) occurred at a  xxxd2563xxx  concentration of
47.0 ( 0.65 mum (p < 0.01).
 xxxd2563xxx  binding to tubulin. the binding of  xxxd2563xxx 
to tubulin has been studied by measuring the intrinsic quenching
of the tryptophan fluorescence of tubulin.  xxxd2563xxx  quenches
the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of tubulin in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner. addition of 40 mum  xxxd2563xxx 
to tubulin (1 mum) quenches ∼76% of the tryptophan fluorescence
of tubulin during a 30 min incubation at 25 °c (figure 8a). the
level of quenching was ∼17% when  xxxd2563xxx  was just added to
tubulin. the increase in the level of tryptophan quenching with
time indicates time-dependent binding at 25 °c which is slow and
takes ∼30 min to reach completion. similar results are observed

when colchicine is added to tubulin (data not shown). however,
 xxxd2563xxx  did not alter the lambdamax of the tryptophan emission
wavelength of tubulin, suggesting that the binding of  xxxd2563xxx 
did not alter the polarity of the immediate environment of
tryptophan residues in tubulin.
the association rate constant for different concentrations of
 xxxd2563xxx  with tubulin was determined by ligand-induced
quenching of tubulin fluorescence. figure 8a shows the kinetic
profile for the binding of  xxxd2563xxx  to tubulin under pseudofirst-order conditions for 30 min at 25 °c. the quenching data
were analyzed using a biexponential equation as explained in
experimental procedures (figure 8b). the apparent secondorder rate constant for the first association phase calculated
from the equation as shown in experimental procedures has been
found to be 189.12 ( 17 m-1 s-1 at 25 °c, whereas the rate
constant for the slow association phase calculated from the same
equation is 32.44 ( 21 m-1 s-1 taking the average of nine
consecutive experimental data analyses at three different concentrations (20, 30, and 40 mum) of  xxxd2563xxx . under the same
experimental condition at 25 °c, we analyzed the fast phase and
slow phase association rate constants for association of colchicine
with tubulin using the biexponential equation, and the values
were 111.35 ( 24 and 72.61 ( 11 m-1 s-1, respectively.
the binding of  xxxd2563xxx  to tubulin was also monitored by
enhancement of  xxxd2563xxx  fluorescence upon binding with
tubulin.  xxxd2563xxx  has weak fluorescence in neutral aqueous

buffer (figure 9a), with maxima at 424 nm upon excitation at
340 nm. when  xxxd2563xxx  was mixed with tubulin in a different
molar ratio, the fluorescence intensity of  xxxd2563xxx  increased
markedly (figure 9a). for example, the fluorescence intensity of

acharya et al.
5 mum  xxxd2563xxx  was increased ≈3-fold in the presence of an
equimolar concentration of tubulin; the emission spectrum of the
 xxxd2563xxx  showed a blue shift upon binding to tubulin, and
the emission maxima shifted to 418 nm. these results indicated
that the polarity of the environment of  xxxd2563xxx  and its
mobility are changed after  xxxd2563xxx   xxxd1740xxx .
figure 9b shows the titration curve ( xxxd2563xxx  fluorescence
enhancement) of a constant amount of  xxxd2563xxx  (5 mum) with
various concentrations of tubulin (0-25 mum).

pbs, fresh medium was added, and after incubation for 0 (a and b),
12 (c and d), and 24 h (e and f) at 37 °c, images were taken with a
confocal microscope. microtubules are tagged with rhodamine (red).

the stoichiometry and the dissociation constant (kd) of the
tubulin- xxxd2563xxx  interaction have been estimated by measuring  xxxd2563xxx  fluorescence enhancement. the stoichiometry of
the drug-protein complex was determined using the job plot. in
this plot, concentrations of both tubulin and  xxxd2563xxx  were
varied while the total drug-protein concentration was kept fixed
at 5 mum. results of such experiments are shown in figure 9c. the
stoichiometry of binding calculated by using this method of
continuous variation has been found to be 1:1. from the titration
curve (figure 9b) of a constant amount of  xxxd2563xxx  (5 mum) and
various concentrations of tubulin (0-25 mum), the binding data
were analyzed as described in experimental procedures, and the
analysis of the data yielded a linear plot with a dissociation
constant of 3.65 ( 0.25 mum (figure 9d,e). taken together, these
data suggested that  xxxd2563xxx   xxxd1740xxx  at a single site.
the stoichiometry and the dissociation constant (kd) of the
tubulin- xxxd2563xxx  interaction have also been investigated by
measuring the effects of  xxxd2563xxx  on the intrinsic tryptophan
fluorescence of tubulin. as shown in figure 10a,  xxxd2563xxx 
reduced the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of tubulin in a
concentration-dependent fashion. the stoichiometry of binding calculated by using this method of continuous variation
(job plot) has also been found to be 1:1 (data not shown). the
double-reciprocal plot of the binding data (figure 10b,c) yielded
a dissociation constant of 2.44 ( 0.34 mum, which is in excellent
agreement with the kd obtained by the ligand fluorescence
titration.
 xxxd2563xxx  binds tubulin competitively at the colchicine binding site. many structurally unrelated natural and
synthetic compounds that inhibit microtubule polymerization
bind to the colchicine-binding site of tubulin (26, 28, 29). like
colchicine,  xxxd2563xxx  also inhibited tubulin polymerization.
thus, we examined whether  xxxd2563xxx  binds at the colchicine
binding site of tubulin. colchicine does not fluoresce in aqueous
solution, but it fluoresces when it  xxxd1740xxx  (47). tubulin
was incubated with a fixed concentration of colchicine and
different concentrations of  xxxd2563xxx  (0-80 mum), and the
fluorescence of colchicine of different samples was measured at
430 nm while the excitation wavelength was 380 nm which
selectively excited only colchicine but not  xxxd2563xxx . although
absorption spectra of  xxxd2563xxx  and colchicine have some
overlap, the extinction coefficient of  xxxd2563xxx  at 380 nm
(862 m-1 cm-1) is very low compared to that of colchicine at
380 nm (7060 m-1 cm-1). we also checked the fluorescence
values of tubulin and  xxxd2563xxx  complexes at 430 nm after
excitation at 380 nm and found them to be very low, and those
values were subtracted from those of the corresponding tubulinmenadione-colchicine complex.  xxxd2563xxx  inhibited binding of
colchicine to tubulin in a concentration-dependent manner. the
data were analyzed using a modified dixon plot (figure 11a).
the results clearly indicate that binding of  xxxd2563xxx  to tubulin
was inhibited competitively by colchicine, yielding a ki value of
2.5 mum. one of the important characteristics of colchicine
binding to tubulin is its irreversibility. this property of drugprotein interaction has been found to be a property of colchicine
structure and its b-ring side chain. here, we present interesting
data for an inhibitor that is structurally unrelated to colchicine
but bears important similarity with the colchicine-tubulin
interaction. to determine whether binding of  xxxd2563xxx  to
tubulin occurs in a reversible mode, we incubated  xxxd2563xxx 
(15 mum) with tubulin (3 mum) at 25 °c. at different time intervals,
the drug-protein complex was withdrawn and the extent of free

6972

biochemistry, vol. 48, no. 29, 2009

colchicine binding of tubulin was estimated using a colchicine
analogue without b-ring ac [2-methoxy-5-(20 ,30 ,40 -trimethoxyphenyl)tropone], which binds tubulin instantaneously at the
colchicine site and gives fluorescence at 430 nm (28). results of
such an experiment where fluorescence of ac was measured at
430 nm are shown in figure 11b. the results indicate that the
fluorescence value of ac decreases with an increase in the
incubation time of the tubulin- xxxd2563xxx  complex at 25 °c.
here the fluorescence of the ac-tubulin complex without
 xxxd2563xxx  was taken to be 100% (control), and the fluorescence
of the tubulin- xxxd2563xxx  complex incubated for 10 min at 25 °c
was found to be 28% less than the control value. the fluorescence
of the complex decreases further to 52% when the complex is
incubated for 45 min. under this identical condition,  xxxd2563xxx 
binds ∼78% (based on the calculation considering a kd of
3.65 mum for the tubulin- xxxd2563xxx  complex) of the total tubulin
present in incubation mixture. therefore, this data clearly
indicate that the interaction of  xxxd2563xxx  with tubulin is not
reversible in nature. these data are corroborated by irreversible
depolymerization of microtubules in hela cells by  xxxd2563xxx .

acharya et al.
chemosensitizing the resistant cells to anticancer drugs. the fact
that  xxxd2563xxx  can inhibit the  xxxg22xxx -mediated function
suggests that these types of compounds can be developed as
inhibitors of this transporter to overcome  xxxg22xxx -mediated
multidrug resistance (49).
although  xxxd2563xxx  is a potential anticancer agent, there is
no direct evidence of its target site inside the cell. the novel results
of this study are that  xxxd2563xxx  inhibited tubulin polymerization

discussion
 xxxd2563xxx  cancer research has focused on two basic mechanisms to explain these effects. the older mechanism relies on an
oxidative effect produced by the one-electron cycling of vitamin
k3 that surpasses the oxidative capacity of the cancer cell, leading
to death (9). the latest research on  xxxd2563xxx  has led researchers
to discover an alternative anticancer mechanism of action that
acts at the level of protein kinases and phosphatases (18). vitamin
k3 has been found to act on proteins such as c-myc and
c-fos (48), as it can promote both proliferation and apoptosis
depending on its expression. cell cycle arrest has also been
found to be initiated by phosphatases at the level of cyclins,
which are critical in the cell cycle (48). a variety of inhibitors of
abc drug transporters have been developed to date with the
objective of reversing resistance against anticancer drugs and

in microtubules in vitro and significantly bound to the purified
tubulin. on the basis of the strong effects of  xxxd2563xxx  on
tubulin and microtubules in vitro, we also examined whether
 xxxd2563xxx  inhibited the proliferation of hela cells with an ic50
of ≈26 mum and kb (human nasopharyngeal epithelial carcinoma
cell) cells with an ic50 of ≈63 mum; both cell lines express high
levels of p-glycoprotein and show resistance to a number of
anticancer drugs.  xxxd2563xxx  significantly induced apoptosis in
the hela cells and also blocked the cell cycle at g2/m phase and
arrest at mitosis.  xxxd2563xxx  depolymerized the interphase
microtubule and also disrupted the spindle assembly of the
mitotic cells. it showed an irreversible pattern of cellular damage
unlike vinblastine and  xxxd1831xxx  (45) but like cryptophycin (46)
and sanguinarin (47). cells treated with  xxxd2563xxx  remained
depleted of microtubules for at least 24 h after the compound was
removed from the cultures. this irreversible damage pattern of
 xxxd2563xxx  may be due to irreversible loss of activity of tubulin
polymerization-promoting factors by denaturation and/or proteolysis or irreversible damage of their binding pocket to tubulin.
these actions on mammalian cell tubulin and microtubules
suggest that the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation by  xxxd2563xxx  in humans may be due in part to the perturbation of
microtubule function. we found that  xxxd2563xxx  inhibits the
polymerization of mammalian brain tubulin, with 50% inhibition (ic50) of polymerization occurring at a  xxxd2563xxx  concentration of 46 mum. thus, its ability to inhibit microtubule
polymerization is significant. the association of  xxxd2563xxx  with
the purified tubulin is biphasic in nature like that of colchicine,
with rate constants of 111.35 ( 24 and 72.61 ( 11 m-1 s-1 for the
fast and slow phases, respectively. we have also shown that
 xxxd2563xxx  binds at the colchicine binding site of the tubulin with
a significant ki value of 2.5 mum. like that of colchicine, the
biphasic nature of the  xxxd2563xxx -tubulin interaction arises
perhaps due to the differential binding property of  xxxd2563xxx 
to  xxxg2353xxx  isotypes present in brain tubulin. we have used
ligand as well as protein fluorescence to determine the binding
affinity of  xxxd2563xxx  for mammalian brain tubulin. using
enhancement of ligand fluorescence upon binding with tubulin
at 418 nm, we obtained a kd of 3.65 ( 0.25 mum, whereas using
quenching of protein fluorescence, we obtained a kd of 2.44 (
0.34 mum. thus, the affinity of  xxxd2563xxx  for brain tubulin is
strong and robust. colchicine  xxxd1740xxx  with high affinity
(kd =0.1-0.5 mum). interestingly, high concentrations of  xxxd2563xxx  were required to inhibit microtubule polymerization (ic50
= 46 mum), whereas its affinity (kd) for tubulin was ≈2.443.65 mum. thus,  xxxd2563xxx  probably does not inhibit microtubule polymerization through a simple end poisoning mechanism like that which occurs with colchicine and vinblastine.
in contrast to  xxxd2563xxx , phylloquinone (vitamin k1), which
is present naturally in green leafy vegetables and catabolized to
 xxxd2563xxx  inside the body, neither exhibits cytotoxicity against
hela cells nor disrupts the microtubule network in hela cells; it
even does not inhibit tubulin polymerization in vitro (data not
shown). although the orally absorbed phylloquinone is strongly
catabolized to the  xxxd2563xxx  by 5-25% (7), dietary phylloquinone will be more than enough as  xxxd2563xxx  supplements inside
the body. in january 2001, the food and nutrition board
(fnb) of the institute of medicine established the adequate
intake (ai) levels for  xxxd3522xxx  in u.s. adults are 120 mug/day (in
men) and 90 mug/day (in women). in an advanced malignancy
phase i trial of  xxxd2563xxx  given as a rapid intravenous infusion,
patients were able to tolerate dose levels from 40 to 200 mg/m2

with no hematological toxicity, although some grade i and grade
ii hypersensitivity reactions occurred at the highest dose of
1360 mg/m2, but no dose-limiting organ system toxicity was
observed (50). this suggests that perhaps a longer infusion of
 xxxd2563xxx  would achieve the peak drug level which has already
been demonstrated to be cytotoxic for sensitive malignant
cell lines.
in summary, the antiproliferative activity of  xxxd2563xxx  has
been correlated to its ability to perturb microtubule networks
through tubulin binding at the colchicine site. nature has
presented us the tubulin microtubule as a highly successful
anticancer target. many natural compounds that target the
tubulin-microtubule system are in different stages of drug
development. thus,  xxxd2563xxx  alone or in combination with
other antimicrotubule agents may be evaluated for its clinical
potential against several types of cancers.
