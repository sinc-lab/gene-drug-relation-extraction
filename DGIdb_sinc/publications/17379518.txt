abstract—the conversion of ribavirin to the monophosphate by  xxxg79xxx  is the rate-limiting step in activation of this broad
spectrum antiviral drug. variation of the 3-substituents in a series of bioisosteric and homologated 1-b-d -ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazoles has marked eﬀects on activity with the human  xxxg79xxx , and analysis of computational descriptors and binding models
oﬀers insight for the design of novel substrates.

rna viruses are signiﬁcant pathogens that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to epidemic scale
diseases such as aids, hepatitis c, inﬂuenza, and
emerging diseases caused by the agents yellow fever
virus, west nile virus, dengue virus, sars cov, and
hantaviruses. few antiviral drugs are available, and clinical treatment must confront the diversity and rapid evolution of resistant strains. the antiviral drug ribavirin
(1-b-d -ribofuranosyl- xxxd17xxx -3-carboxamide) 1 was
ﬁrst synthesized in 1972 and has shown broad spectrum
antiviral activity against both rna and dna viruses.1
ribavirin has been used clinically in combination with
interferon-a for treatment of hepatitis c virus (hcv)
infection, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), several viral
hemorrhagic fever causing viruses, and recently
for sars cov infections.2–5 side eﬀects, including
hemolytic anemia,6,7 and viral resistance8,9 are major
limitations.

this is the predominant mechanism for the antiviral
activity of ribavirin against yellow fever, parainﬂuenza
3, and respiratory syncytial viruses.16–18 other mechanisms of ribavirin’s antiviral activity include: (1) inhibition of inﬂuenza virus rna polymerase in vitro with
 xxxd3111xxx  (rtp),19,20 (2) inhibition of viral
genome capping through interference with guanyltransferase or methyltransferase activity in sindbis virus,21–23
and (3) modulation of host immune response in hcv
infected patients.24,25 recent interest has been focused
on increased mutation rates in the viral genome that affect replication, transcription, and virion viability. this
has been shown in the case of hantaan virus, an old
world hantavirus that can produce a life-threatening
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.26

the phosphorylation of ribavirin to the 5 0 -monophosphate by human  xxxg79xxx  (hadk) is the ratelimiting step for activation to the physiologically relevant
triphosphate.10–14 several mechanisms for ribavirin’s
antiviral activity have been identiﬁed. it inhibits inosine
5 0 -monophosphate dehydrogenase and decreases intra-

there is great interest in the development of synthetic
nucleoside analogs with modiﬁed hydrogen bonding,
p-stacking, hydrophobic and steric features to exploit
the decreased ﬁdelity of viral replication and transcription.27,28 considering the importance of hadk for metabolic activation of 1, we were interested in evaluating
structural eﬀects within a closely related series of
3-substituted-1-b-d -ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazoles as part
of our ongoing eﬀorts to develop new antiviral drugs
for rna viruses.

hydrogen-bonding capacity, and ionic charge. compounds 2–4 possess isosteric substitutions for the 3-carboxamide of 1 including nitro, ketone, and carboxylate
groups, respectively. derivatives 5, 7, and 8 are homologs and constitutional isomers of 1 that incorporate
an additional methylene group. the carbonyl oxygen
of 1 was replaced with n-methyl in amidine derivative 6.
the nitro derivative 2 was prepared by direct fusion of
3-nitro- xxxd17xxx  with 1-o-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-o-benzoyl-b-d -ribofuranose.29 the carboxylate 4 and n-methylcarboxamide 5 were obtained after deprotecting the
commercially available methyl ester (i) followed by
saponiﬁcation or methylamine substitution, respectively.30 the methyl ketone 3 and the  xxxd63xxx  8 were
synthesized as shown in scheme 1.39,40 introduction of
tert-butyldimethylsilyl protecting groups followed by
selective reduction of the methyl ester with diisobutylaluminum hydride provided the aldehyde, then addition
of methylmagnesium bromide, oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate, and deprotection gave the methyl
ketone 3. the  xxxd63xxx  8 was synthesized from 2 by
reduction of the nitro with hydrazine, followed by acetylation and ester hydrolysis. the n-methylamidine 6
and methyl imidate 7 were prepared from 1 following
the literature route.30 no hydrolysis of 6 or 7 was evident by 1h nmr after two weeks in d2o at 25 °c.
the hadk clone 20-1 was generously provided by dr.
jozef spychala (unc chapel hill, chapel hill, nc)
and hadk was prepared as described.31 nucleosides
were assayed as substrates for hadk, and reaction
products were detected by hplc. assay conditions consisted of 50 mm hepes (ph 6.0), 40 mm kcl, 1 mm
mgcl2, 1 mm atp, 0.1% bsa, 10 lm  xxxd2879xxx , 100 lm of the test compound, and enzyme. reactions were started by the addition of enzyme and
incubated in a 37 °c water bath. aliquots of 50 ll were

computational methods were used to characterize possible structural contributions to hadk activity within
this series. geometries were fully optimized in the gas
phase at the b3lyp/6-31g** level of theory. in each
case, computation identiﬁed the syn glycoside conformation of compounds 1–8 as the minimum energy conformers, in which n2 of the triazole base is oriented into
the ribofuranose ring. these results are consistent with
the reported conformational preference of 1 in solution
as determined by nmr and circular dichroism.32,33 the
validity of the calculated glycoside conformation of 2
was conﬁrmed experimentally by observation of strong
noe correlation between h5-h1 0 in the noesy
spectrum.

the speciﬁc and relative activities for phosphorylation
of 1–8 by hadk are shown in table 1. enzyme activity
was only detected with four of the ribavirin analogs (2,
3, 5, and 6). however, these analogs were less eﬀective
substrates than 1. in addition, none of the ribavirin analogs (2–8) inhibited the phosphorylation of ribavirin by
hadk (data not shown). since a 4000-fold excess of
compound did not inhibit the phosphorylation of ribavirin, these results indicated that the km of the analogs
was much higher than the km for ribavirin. because
compound 2 had 18% of the activity of ribavirin but
did not inhibit the phosphorylation of ribavirin, these
results would suggest that 2 has a higher vmax than
ribavirin.

samples were neutralized to ph 7, and precipitated salts
were removed by centrifugation. reactants and products were separated by hplc using bio basic anion exchange column (thermo electron corp., bellefonte,
pa) with a 40-min linear salt and ph gradient from
5 mm ammonium phosphate (ph 2.8) to 750 mm
ammonium phosphate (ph 6). peaks were detected as
they eluted from the column by absorbance at their
kmax, typically 215 nm. all enzyme reactions were linear
during the incubation period and substrate conversions
were maintained at less than 10%.12 the potential for
inhibition of hadk activity was evaluated by monitoring the formation of ribavirin monophosphate in the
presence of compounds 2–8. the initial ribavirin concentration was 0.1 lm, with individual compounds at
400 lm.

computationally derived molecular descriptors have
been shown to be useful for comparative evaluation of
bioisosteres.34 the electrostatic potential densities of
1–8 were mapped on the van der waals surfaces in the
space ﬁlling models using spartan’06. the molecular
electrostatic potential (mep) mapped on the isodensity
surface of the molecule provides a visual indicator for
qualitative comparison of hydrogen bonding capacities,
with a spectrum ranging from red representing high electron density to blue (table 2).
additional selected computational descriptors for 1–8
are listed in table 3. hydrophobic interactions can
be approximated using complementary lipophilic
proﬁles, the water accessible hydrophobic surface area
of the molecule (cpk area), and log p octanol/water
partition coeﬃcients (log pow). comparison of longrange electrostatic interactions of neutral molecules
can be approximated using the dipole moment/volume
(l/v). the descriptor for chemical hardness g = (lumo  homo/2) provides an estimation of the
aromaticity that relates to the propensity for p-stacking. the calculated g values for all of the compounds
are similar (0.077–0.113 ev) and represent comparable
p-stacking capacities across the series of substituted
triazole bases.

the compounds evaluated fall within two general classes, isosteres possessing overall steric volume similar to
1 but altered functionality that aﬀects h-bonding (2–
4), and homologated analogs possessing increased steric
proﬁles and altered hydrophobicity (5–8). the 3-nitro
derivative 2 was the most active synthetic analog. this
compound possesses a molecular electrostatic potential
map that is similar to 1 (ribavirin), the smallest volume,
highest lipophilicity and dipole moment/volume. the nitro group is isostructural to the carboxamide but typically exhibits weaker intermolecular h-bond accepting
capabilities.35 nitrated base analogs have been extensively evaluated as potential universal bases where nitro-arenes typically form strong p–p stacking
interactions through polarization of the (hetero) aryl
ring.36 the derivative b-ribofuranosyl-3-nitropyrrole
was reported to undergo phosphorylation equivalent
to ribavirin using hamster adk.14 the ketone 3 is a
structural mimic of 1 where replacement of the amine
with methyl eliminates two h-bond donors. the activity
of n-methyl derivative 5 was comparable with that of 3,
n-methylribamidine 6 was 20-fold less active than 1,
while 4, 7, and 8 were ineﬀective substrates.

site revealed the possibility of deeper penetration into
the lipophilic pocket to enable p-stacking of the triazole
with phenylalanine residue f170.37 in this position, the
carboxamide amine group of 1 mimics the critical n6amine of adenosine that undergoes h-bonding to bound
waters w416, and w415 associated with residues t173
and i39. the increased penetration of 1 into the substrate binding pocket would position the 5 0 -hydroxy
group further from the bound atp that is responsible
for phosphorylation, resulting in reduced rates of phosphorylation relative to adenosine.
all of the 3-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles 2–8 were less eﬃcient hadk substrates than 1. comparable p-stacking
capacities are expected across the series based on the
computed g-values. the nitro and methyl groups of 2
and 3 cannot interact as h-bond donors with w415
and w416, and the methyl of carboxamide 5 would effect these interactions, altering substrate orientation
and enzyme structure compared with adenosine, resulting in decreased activity.37,38

inhibitors due to displacement of w415 resulting in
stronger hydrophobic interactions with i39.
this study demonstrates that structural modiﬁcations
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the hadk activity of 3-substituted
1-.b-d -ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazoles. the ribavirin derivatives 4, 7, and 8 were ineﬀective substrates for hadk,
and these results may correlate with the reported lack of
antiviral activity against distinct viruses, although
metabolism by other enzymatic pathways is not excluded.30 the isosteric derivatives 2, 3 and n-methyl
homolog 5 were phosphorylated by hadk, and the
antiviral activity of these compounds is currently under
investigation. consideration of computational descriptors and structural interactions provides insight substrate binding and activity into and provides direction
for additional structural optimization for the development of antiviral nucleoside analogs with improved
selectivity and reduced side eﬀects.
acknowledgments

it is instructive to compare these results with other
structurally modiﬁed nucleoside derivatives that are substrates for hadk (fig. 1). the 7-deaza-purine, tubercidin, and related 7-carboxamido-purine derivative,
sangivamycin, exhibit favorable electrostatic and
p-stacking interactions and are excellent substrates for
adk.11 in contrast, the 7-carbonitrile and 7-iodo analogs, toyocomycin, and tubercidin, are potent adk
