abstract
alpha2a-adrenoceptors mediate the antinociceptive effects of  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonists in mice, and analgesic synergism between noradrenergic
and opioidergic mechanisms has been reported to be lacking in mice devoid of functional alpha2a-adrenoceptors. we investigated whether the
antinociceptive actions of opioid agonists with different efficacy would be altered in mice with targeted inactivation of the  xxxg88xxx  gene
(alpha2a-ko mice). the antinociceptive effects of fentanyl, morphine, buprenorphine and tramadol were assessed using conventional tail-flick and
hot-plate assays. antinociceptive responses to fentanyl were unaltered in the alpha2a-ko animals. morphine analgesia was slightly accentuated in the
tail-flick test. the naloxone-sensitive antinociceptive responses to both tested weak partial agonists were very markedly accentuated in both tests.
for example, after 40 mg/kg tramadol administration, the tramadol-induced prolongation of tail-flick latency was 86 ± 6% of the maximal possible
effect (mpe) in alpha2a-ko and 22 ± 2% of mpe in control mice; prolongation of hot-plate latency was 93 ± 5% of mpe in alpha2a-ko mice and 8 ± 2%
of mpe in the controls (p b 0.001 for both). the effects of alpha2a-ko were mimicked by pretreatment of wild-type control mice with the alpha2adrenoceptor antagonists, atipamezole and yohimbine; the apparent efficacy of tramadol and buprenorphine now approached that of morphine and
fentanyl. other behavioural effects of the tested opioid agonists were not similarly influenced by alpha2a-ko. antagonists of alpha2a-adrenoceptors may
offer a novel mechanism to augment the antinociceptive actions of partial opioid agonists.

1. introduction
noradrenergic and opioidergic systems play important roles
in the modulation of pain and have synergistic interactions on
both spinal and supraspinal levels. antinociceptive effects are
mediated by  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors and opioid peptide receptors that
belong to the rhodopsin-like family of heptahelical cell membrane receptors. they couple to similar pertussis toxin-sensitive
gi/o-type g-proteins and to similar signal transduction pathways: their activation leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase
activity, activation of k+ currents, inhibition of ca2+ channels,
and increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (jordan and devi, 1998; morita and north, 1981; richman
and regan, 1998). the involvement of these receptors in anti⁎ corresponding author. mail: itäinen pitkäkatu 4, fi-20520 turku, finland.

nociception depends on both presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release and on hyperpolarization and reduced
excitability of postsynaptic neuronal membranes. morphine
and many synthetic opioid derivatives are commonly used for
the treatment of severe pain, but troubling side effects, development of tolerance and dependence, and drug addiction limit
the usefulness of this class of drugs, especially in prolonged
use. many approaches have been investigated in attempts to
overcome these problems. synergism with noradrenergic antinociceptive mechanisms is one such approach.
opioid peptide receptors are encoded by four distinct mammalian genes, i.e. there are four distinct opioid receptor subtypes: mu-, delta-, kappa- and orphaninfq (nociceptin) receptors
(waldhoer et al., 2004). the analgesic efficacy and most of
the typical opioidergic undesired effects of morphine are mainly mediated by mu-opioid receptors. studies on gene-targeted
(knock-out, ko) mice lacking individual opioid receptor subtypes have shown that antinociception, tolerance to opioid
analgesia, drug dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and many

106

other classical opioid effects of morphine, such as hyperlocomotion and constipation, are absent in mu-opioid receptor-deficient mice (kieffer and gaveriaux-ruff, 2002).
three  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor subtypes have been identified in
humans and in mice, i.e. alpha2a-, alpha2b- and alpha2c-adrenoceptors.
of these, alpha2a- and alpha2c-adrenoceptors have widespread expression in the central nervous system (cns). the  xxxg88xxx  is the principal  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor subtype in the cns.
presynaptically localized alpha2a- and alpha2c-adrenoceptors inhibit
the release of noradrenaline and several other neurotransmitters
(brede et al., 2004; bucheler et al., 2002; hein, 2001). the
antinociceptive and sedative properties of  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonists are mainly attributed to  xxxg88xxx  activation, as
evidenced by studies on mice lacking functional alpha2a-adrenoceptors (hunter et al., 1997; lähdesmäki et al., 2002; lakhlani
et al., 1997; stone et al., 1997). it has been reported that
activation of postsynaptic alpha2a-adrenoceptors in the prefrontal
cortex is involved in mediation of working memory, behavioural inhibition and attentional functions (arnsten and cai,
1993; arnsten et al., 1996; arnsten, 2004). postsynaptically
localized alpha2c-adrenoceptors have also been found in the mouse
cns, mainly localized in the basal ganglia, olfactory tubercle,
hippocampus, and cerebral cortex, and also in the spinal cord
and brain stem (holmberg et al., 2003).
the brain noradrenergic system plays an important role in
modulation of opioid actions.  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonists potentiate morphine analgesia, and there is antinociceptive synergism
between endogenous  xxxg831xxx -noradrenergic and opioidergic mechanisms in the spinal cord of mice (fairbanks and wilcox,
1999; ossipov et al., 1990a) and rats (ossipov et al., 1990b).
 xxxg2240xxx -induced behavioural nociceptive responses are
inhibited by intrathecally administered opioid agonists and
 xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonists in mice (roerig et al., 1992). it has
been shown that alpha2a-adrenoceptors and mu-opioid receptors are
co-localized in proximal dendrites in primary hippocampal
neurons (jordan et al., 2003), and similar localization patterns
were also reported in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of mice
(pasternak, 2001; waldhoer et al., 2004).
analgesic responses to  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonists are absent
in alpha2a-ko mice (lähdesmäki et al., 2002; özdogan et al.,
2004; stone et al., 1997). also analgesic synergism of opioids
with  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonists was lost in the alpha2a-ko animals,
confirming the central role of alpha2a-adrenoceptors in this effect.
in our previous study we tested morphine-induced antinociception in alpha2a-ko mice. morphine analgesia was similar in wildtype control mice and in alpha2a-ko mice in the tail-flick test
(özdogan et al., 2004), as also reported previously for mice
with dysfunctional alpha2a-adrenoceptors (stone et al., 1997).
these experiments on opioid actions in alpha2a-ko mice were
carried out with morphine, which is a highly efficacious partial
mu-opioid receptor agonist. there is, however, a broad range of
full and partial mu-opioid receptor agonists in clinical use. in this
study we tested whether the relative antinociceptive efficacy of
full and partial mu-opioid agonists in mice would be influenced
by the absence of alpha2a-adrenoceptors.
antinociception was assessed with the tail-flick test and the
hot-plate test. other behavioural effects of the investigated

agents were monitored by observing typical opioid-induced
effects, i.e. changes in locomotor activity, rearings, tail elevation, motor coordination and body temperature. two  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonists, atipamezole and yohimbine, and the muopioid receptor antagonist naloxone were also used to block
their respective receptor types.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
male c57bl/6j control mice and mice with targeted disruption of the  xxxg88xxx  gene (alpha2a-ko) weighing
20–35 g were used. the generation of an alpha2a-ko mouse
line has been described previously (altman et al., 1999). the
alpha2a-ko mice were backcrossed to c57bl/6j mice for a
minimum of five generations to produce a congenic line.
animals were allowed free access to food (rm 3 standard
pellets, sds, u.k.) and tap water, and were kept under artificial light for 12 h each day in a room with controlled
temperature (21 °c) and humidity (50 ± 10%). all experiments
were approved by the local committee for animal welfare and
were in accordance with the european communities council
directive of 24 november 1986 (86/906/eec). the same
groups of mice were subjected to the entire test protocol. the
group n was 9 or 10.
2.2. drugs
morphine hcl and yohimbine hcl (sigma, st. louis, mo),
 xxxd3407xxx  (tramadol generics®, therabel pharma, rotterdam, the netherlands), fentanyl hcl (fentanyl®, janssencilag, beerse, belgium), buprenorphine (temgesic®, schering-plough, brussels, belgium), atipamezole (orion pharma,
turku, finland) and  xxxd2694xxx  (rbi, natick, ma) were
used. the drugs were dissolved in or diluted into physiological
saline. physiological saline was used as control. all drugs were
administered in a volume of 10 ml/kg i.p. or s.c. (naloxone and
 xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonists).
2.3. antinociceptive tests
drug-induced antinociception was assessed with the tailflick method with a cut-off time of 10 s using a commercial
tail-flick analgesiameter (ugo basile, comercio, italy) and with
the hot-plate method with 55 °c temperature and a cut-off time
of 15 s using a commercial hot-plate analgesiameter (itc inc.,
woodlands hills, ca). in the hot-plate test, the mice were
placed on a metal plate surrounded by a clear plastic chamber.
the latency to lick one of the hind paws or to jump off the plate
was measured. basal tail-flick and hot-plate scores were first
measured, followed by a second tail-flick and hot-plate measurement after i.p. administration of the test drugs or saline. the
assessments were repeated after suitable intervals, depending
on the duration of action of the investigated agents (see results
for time points). tail-flick and hot-plate latencies were converted to percent of maximal possible effect (%mpe): %

107

mpe = (measured latency − basal latency) / (cut-off time − basal
latency) × 100%.
2.4. spontaneous locomotor activity
immediately after the opioid agonist administration, the
mice were placed individually into transparent polypropylene
locomotor activity cages housed in a photo-beam recording
system (san diego instruments, san diego, ca). three different types of activity were recorded: ambulations, fine movements and rearings (lähdesmäki et al., 2002). the locomotor
activity was measured for 1 h.
2.5. motor coordination
motor coordination was tested using an accelerating rota-rod
treadmill (acceler rota-rod 7650 ugo basile, varese, italy)
for mice (diameter 3.5 cm). the treadmill was accelerated from
0 to 5 min. the mice were tested for motor coordination
immediately after the assessment of spontaneous locomotor
activity, 1 h after drug administration. the time spent on the
drum was recorded for each mouse.
2.6. straub phenomenon and body temperature
tail elevation (straub phenomenon) was recorded on a scale
of 0 (flattened) to 2 (elevated to an angle n45° above horizontal). core body temperature was measured using a rectal probe
and a digital thermometer (ellab, roedovre, denmark). the
probe was inserted 2.5 cm inside the anal sphincter. tail elevation and body temperature were measured immediately after the
test for motor coordination.

and  xxxg88xxx  knock-out (ko) mice. tail-flick latencies were converted

between the mouse genotypes.

2.7. statistical analysis
the analgesic effects of each drug were tested using twoway analysis of variance (anova) followed by scheffé post
hoc tests using spss programs (spss 8.0 for windows,
spss inc., chicago, il). different drug treatments and
antagonists were compared to saline-treated groups using
independent samples t-tests. non-parametric data were compared using the mann–whitney u-test. all results are presented as mean ± s.e.m. the level of significance was set at
p b 0.05.
3. results
3.1. effects of opioid agonists on tail-flick and hot-plate latency
in wild-type and alpha2a-ko mice
fentanyl-induced analgesic responses were similar in wildtype and alpha2a-ko mice (genotype × drug interaction was not
significant in either tail-flick or hot-plate tests in two-way
anova; for example, 10 min after 0.5 mg/kg fentanyl administration, in alpha2a-ko mice and wild-type mice; 89 ± 3% and 86
± 2% of mpe in tail-flick test and 100 ± 0% in both genotypes
in hot-plate test) (fig. 1a and b).

the antinociceptive effect of morphine was somewhat accentuated in the alpha2a-ko mice in the tail-flick test (genotype × drug interaction; p b 0.01 in two-way anova), but no
difference was observed in the hot-plate test (genotype × drug
interaction not significant; p n 0.05) (for example, 30 min after
10 mg/kg morphine administration, in alpha2a-ko mice and wildtype mice; 87 ± 7% and 50 ± 6% of mpe in tail-flick test and
96 ± 4% and 91 ± 4% of mpe in hot-plate test) (fig. 2a and b).
the analgesic response to buprenorphine was significantly
accentuated in the alpha2a-ko mice in both analgesic tests (genotype × drug interaction; p b 0.05 in two-way anova in both
analgesia tests, both after 60 and 120 min) (for example, 60 min
after 3 mg/kg buprenorphine administration, in alpha2a-ko and
wild-type mice; 69 ± 8% and 26 ± 4% of mpe in the tail-flick
test and 61 ± 7% and 35 ± 5% of mpe in the hot-plate test) (fig.
3a and b). buprenorphine-induced analgesia was partially
blocked by naloxone in alpha2a-ko mice (25 ± 3% of mpe in the
tail-flick test and 11 ± 2% of mpe in the hot-plate test, t-test
p = 0.025 and p b 0.001), and fully blocked in wild-type mice
(4 ± 1% of mpe in the tail-flick test and − 2 ± 1% of mpe in the
hot-plate test, p b 0.001 for both). the  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist, atipamezole, did not significantly modulate the effect of
buprenorphine in alpha2a-ko mice (p n 0.1 in both tests) but

95 ± 73% of mpe in the hot-plate test; one-way anova
p b 0.001 in both analgesic tests, scheffé test p b 0.001 for
both) (fig. 6). also yohimbine at 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg
clearly potentiated tramadol-induced analgesia in wild-type
mice (one-way anova p b 0.003 in both tests; for example,
from 21 ± 1% of mpe after saline plus tramadol to 46 ± 2% of
mpe after 5 mg/kg yohimbine plus tramadol 40 mg/kg in the
tail-flick test, and similarly from 15 ± 2% to 93 ± 5% of mpe
in the hot-plate test; scheffé test p b 0.001 in both tests).
however, at the highest dose of yohimbine, this potentiation
was confounded by hyperactivity in both tests (results not
shown).

(42 ± 5% of mpe in tail-flick and 45 ± 1% of mpe in hot-plate

responses to tramadol were very markedly accentuated in
the alpha2a-ko mice in both antinociceptive tests (genotype × drug
interaction: p b 0.001 in two-way anova in both tests) (for
example, 30 min after 40 mg/kg tramadol administration, in
alpha2a-ko and wild-type mice; 86 ± 6% and 22 ± 2% of mpe in
the tail-flick test and 93 ± 5% and 8 ± 2% of mpe in the hotplate test) (fig. 4a and b). tramadol-induced analgesia was
totally blocked by the mu-opioid antagonist naloxone in both
genotypes in both analgesic tests (0 ± 1% and − 1 ± 2% of mpe
in the tail-flick test and 7 ± 1% and 10 ± 4% of mpe in the hotplate test). the  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist, atipamezole, potentiated tramadol-induced analgesia in wild-type mice in both
analgesic tests (p b 0.01 in both tests compared to control mice
pretreated with saline before tramadol administration), but it
partly antagonized the effects of tramadol in alpha2a-ko mice
(p b 0.002 in both tests) (fig. 5a and b).
two different  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonists at different doses
were tested as pretreatment before 40 mg/kg tramadol administration in wild-type mice. atipamezole had no significant
analgesic effects in wild-type mice when given alone, but it
dose-dependently potentiated tramadol-induced analgesia in
both analgesic tests (for example, 1 h after 3 mg/kg atipamezole
administration to 91 ± 5% of mpe in the tail-flick test and to

morphine-induced and tramadol-induced impairment of
motor coordination were assessed in the rotarod test. there
were no statistically significant differences in the drug effects
between the genotypes (genotype × drug interactions were not
significant, p = 0.8 after morphine treatment and p = 0.2 after
tramadol treatment in two-way anova). tramadol did not
impair rotarod test performance. morphine reduced rotarod
latency similarly in both types of mice (for example, 30 min
after 30 mg/kg morphine administration, from 2.4 ± 0.2 to
1.3 ± 0.4 min in alpha2a-ko mice and from 2.7 ± 0.2 to 1.6 ± 0.3

(results not shown).
body temperature was similarly increased after morphine
administration in both genotypes [genotype × drug interaction
was not significant, p = 0.07; for example, 30 min after 5 mg/kg
morphine administration, body temperature was 38.1 ± 0.3 °c
in alpha2a-ko mice (compared to 36.5 ± 0.2 °c after saline) and
38.3 ± 0.4 °c in wild-type mice (compared to 36.8 ± 0.2 °c after
saline; dose effect p b 0.001 in both genotypes in one-way
anova) (results not shown).
there was no significant difference in the expression of tail
elevation (straub phenomenon) after morphine administration
between the genotypes. morphine at 5 mg/kg induced tail
elevation to a level between 1° and 45° above horizontal in
all mice, and  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg induced tail elevation to n 45° above
horizontal in all mice.
locomotor activity was assessed using three different parameters, i.e. rearings, ambulatory activity and fine movements.
there was a significant genotype × drug interaction in two-way

(p b 0.001). morphine treatment decreased rearings in both

fine movements in alpha2a-ko mice (for example, after 30 mg/kg
morphine treatment, 94% increase in alpha2a-ko mice compared
to saline) (results not shown).
tramadol treatment decreased rearings in both genotypes
(for example, after 40 mg/kg tramadol, 46% decrease in alpha2ako mice and 31% decrease in wild-type mice compared to
saline) (results not shown). tramadol treatment also dose-dependently decreased ambulatory activity in alpha2a-ko mice, but
no consistent effect on ambulatory activity was seen in wildtype mice (for example, after 40 mg/kg tramadol, there was a
40% decrease in alpha2a-ko mice and a non-significant 7% increase in wild-type mice, compared to saline) (results not
shown). tramadol somewhat increased fine movements in
alpha2a-ko mice but had no significant effect on their number in
wild-type mice (for example, after 40 mg/kg tramadol, there
was a 41% increase in alpha2a-ko mice and a 16% decrease in
wild-type mice compared to saline) (results not shown). no
significant genotype × drug interactions were observed in these
parameters of locomotion in two-way anova.
pretreatment with the  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist atipamezole did not significantly influence the locomotor effects of
tramadol in alpha2a-ko mice, but resulted in significant tramadol-induced decreases in ambulatory activity in wild-type mice
(after 1 mg/kg atipamezole pretreatment before tramadol 40
mg/kg, there was a 70% decrease in activity counts, compared
to saline treatment, p = 0.002). pretreatment with naloxone
resulted in significant inhibition of ambulatory activity in both
genotypes after tramadol administration (after 1 mg/kg naloxone and 40 mg/kg tramadol, ambulatory activity counts were
decreased by 59% in alpha2a-ko mice and by 85% in wild-type
mice compared to saline pretreatment preceding tramadol;
p = 0.03 and p = 0.001).
4. discussion
the antinociceptive efficacy of two partial opioid agonists,
tramadol and buprenorphine, was very markedly increased in
mice with targeted inactivation of the  xxxg88xxx  gene.
similar effects were observed in two antinociceptive tests,
hot-plate and tail-flick assays. fentanyl-induced analgesic
responses were similar in wild-type and alpha2a-ko mice in both
tests. morphine-induced antinociception was similar in both
genotypes in the hot-plate test but the responses to morphine
were increased in alpha2a-ko mice in the tail-flick test. pretreatment with naloxone fully blocked the antinociceptive effects of
tramadol, indicating mediation via mu-opioid receptors. pretreatment with the  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist, atipamezole, potentiated the antinociceptive effects of the two partial opioid
agonists in wild-type control mice that now showed similar
analgesic responses to tramadol and buprenorphine as alpha2ako mice. these findings are in contrast to previous results
obtained with morphine or other highly efficacious opioid
agonists; opioid analgesia has either been unaffected or even
antagonized by pretreatment with  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonists
(herrero and solano, 1999; iglesias et al., 1992).
there were no significant differences between the mouse
lines in their general sensitivity to opioids, as assessed with the

rotarod test, locomotor activity recordings, body temperature
and tail elevation (straub phenomenon), but the alpha2a-ko mice
were less active than the wild-type control animals in all three
parameters of locomotor activity (rearings, ambulatory activity
and fine movements), as already reported earlier (lähdesmäki
et al., 2002). these results show that alpha2a-ko mice are more
sensitive to the antinociceptive effects of partial opioid agonists
compared to wild-type control mice; other drug effects were not
similarly influenced. pretreatment of wild-type mice with two
 xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonists mimicked the effect of  xxxg88xxx  gene deletion on opioid sensitivity in antinociceptive
tests, and pretreatment with naloxone blocked the antinociceptive effects of tramadol and buprenorphine, suggesting mediation via mu-type opioid receptors.
the analgesic effects of opioids are due to inhibition of
primary and secondary nociceptive afferent neurons, presynaptic inhibition of release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the
dorsal horn of the spinal cord and activation of descending
inhibitory systems. activation of supraspinal opioid receptors
in the central gray matter, the nucleus raphe magnus and the
locus coeruleus, results in increased activity of descending
inhibitory serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways that inhibit
the processing of nociceptive information in the dorsal horn of
the spinal cord (reisine and pastermak, 1996).
opioids reduce neurotransmitter release by inhibiting voltage-gated ca2+ channels on presynaptic neuronal terminals
and hyperpolarize postsynaptic neurons by increasing inwardly
rectifying k+ channel conductance (jordan and devi, 1998).
 xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonists induce antinociception by similar
mechanisms (mitrovic et al., 2003). it has been demonstrated
that analgesic responses to  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonists are mediated at both supraspinal and spinal sites in mice (lakhlani et al.,
1997; li and eisenach, 2001; miranda et al., 2001).
the dorsal horn of the spinal cord represents an important
site for the antinociceptive synergism between opioid and alpha2adrenergic mechanisms (ossipov et al., 1990a, 1989). as demonstrated with  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor and mu-opioid receptor antagonists, neither receptor mechanism is absolutely required for the
antinociception mediated by the other. the analgesic activity of
the mu-opioid agonist, morphine, was not altered in  xxxg88xxx  deficient mice (lähdesmäki et al., 2003). corresponding
results are available from mu-opioid peptide receptor ko mice:
analgesic responses to  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonists, uk 14,304 in
the intrathecal sp-induced nociceptive test (guo et al., 2003),
and dexmedetomidine in the paw-withdrawal test were not
altered in these mice (mansikka et al., 2002).
the interactions of opioid and  xxxg831xxx -adrenergic analgesic
mechanisms may be very complex. the localization and the
receptor subtypes involved in the interactions of these systems
with regard to antinociception and other opioid-induced behaviours are still unclear. it is possible that the life-long absence
of autoinhibitory alpha2a-adrenoceptors could lead to desensitization of postsynaptic mechanisms mediating opioid-induced
analgesia and other behaviours. there are several partly conflicting reports on the importance and modulation of these
interactions. the  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine has
been shown to antagonize morphine analgesia in rats (iglesias

ü.k. özdoğan et al. / european journal of pharmacology 529 (2006) 105–113

et al., 1992), but the analgesia produced by the  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, was not sensitive to the mu-opioid antagonist, naloxone (hylden et al., 1991; ossipov et al., 1989).
also, the antinociceptive efficacy of the mu-opioid agonist
fentanyl was reduced in the presence of the  xxxg831xxx -adrenergic
antagonist idazoxan in inflammation (herrero and solano,
1999). on the other hand, it has been reported that yohimbine
potentiated morphine analgesia in humans (gear et al., 1995).
mice with genetic inactivation of the noradrenaline transporter had increased sensitivity for morphine in the tail-flick
assay, indicating that increased synaptic noradrenaline concentrations evoked potentiation of the opioid effects. this synergism was mediated by  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors; it was blocked by
administration of yohimbine (bohn et al., 2000). therefore, it
could be expected that lack or selective antagonism of presynaptic  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors would lead to enhanced opioid analgesia through increased synaptic noradrenaline concentrations,
but lack or selective antagonism of postsynaptic  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors would lead to attenuated opioid analgesia through loss of
sites of action for descending noradrenergic inhibition in the
spinal cord. alpha2a-adrenoceptors are expressed both pre-and
postsynaptically (scheinin et al., 1994), and the possible effects
of alpha2a-ko on antinociceptive responses to opioids are therefore difficult to predict.
earlier studies have not noted differences in baseline nociceptive mechanisms between alpha2a-ko and wild-type control
mice, nor have the acute analgesic effects of morphine been
altered in alpha2a-ko animals in normal or inflamed conditions
(lähdesmäki et al., 2003; malmberg et al., 2001). also our
previous results indicated that the acute morphine-induced
prolongation of tail-flick latency was similar between the
genotypes (özdogan et al., 2004). this was in line with
earlier findings suggesting that acute morphine analgesia is
not dependent on  xxxg88xxx  activation (stone et al.,
1997).
in addition to their function as autoreceptors, presynaptic
 xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors can also regulate some other neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous system, and thus act as
“heteroreceptors”. in the brain, alpha2a- and alpha2c-adrenoceptors
inhibit dopamine release in the basal ganglia (bucheler et al.,
2002) and also serotonin release in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (brede et al., 2004; scheibner et al., 2001). loss of
 xxxg88xxx  function could influence opioid antinociception through such indirect mechanisms.
lack of alpha2a-adrenoceptors could cause sensitization of
some components of the downstream signaling pathways due
to loss of receptor-dependent desensitization. it has been
reported that locus coeruleus neurons are inhibited by both muopioid receptors and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors (aghajanian and wang,
1987), and that both receptor types activate the same k+ channels (miyake et al., 1989). similar k+ channels (katp,  xxxg1254xxx 
and  xxxg1229xxx ) appear to be involved in the antinociception induced
by agonists of  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors and mu-opioid receptors (asano
et al., 2000; ocana et al., 2004). similarly, in rat amygdala
neurons, inhibitory responses to opioids and to clonidine are
colocalized in the same neurons (freedman and aghajanian,
1985). thus, since opioids and noradrenaline and clonidine-like

111

 xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonists act through different receptors, but
share the same downstream signal transduction pathways, loss
of  xxxg88xxx -mediated desensitization could account
for the increased antinociceptive sensitivity to partial opioid
agonists, but then this putative resensitization must be very
rapid, as the effects of alpha2a-ko were mimicked by acute pretreatment with  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonists. likewise, the present results do not exclude alterations in opioid receptor function
or the relative opioid receptor subtype selectivity of the two
employed partial mu-opioid agonists, buprenorphine and tramadol, as possible explanations for the observed effects, but again,
no evidence exists for such an action for the two  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonists that had similar effects on opioid sensitivity
as alpha2a-ko.
hetero-oligomerization, i.e. direct physical associations between mu-opioid receptors and alpha2a-adrenoceptors could also
play a role in the functional interactions between these receptors, as already shown for opioid receptor subtypes (jordan
and devi, 1999). jordan et al. (2003) reported the existence of
hetero-oligomerization of alpha2a-adrenoceptors and mu-opioid
receptors after overexpression in fibroblasts or primary cultures of hippocampal or spinal cord neurons. hetero-oligomers of alpha2a-adrenoceptors and mu-opioid receptors were also
recently detected in transfected hek-293 cells (zhang and
limbird, 2004). lack of  xxxg88xxx  expression or stabilization of an inactive  xxxg88xxx  conformation could
lead to loss of constraints to mu-opioid receptor function and to
increased sensitivity to partial mu-opioid agonists. as the
effects of the tested  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonists on the efficacy of tramadol and buprenorphine were rapid, increased
availability of mu-opioid binding sites is not a likely mechanism; our results point to enhanced efficacy of partial opioid
agonists, not a general increase in agonist affinity at opioid
receptors. increased efficacy of partial agonists could be
caused by liberation of mu-opioid receptors from a constraint
that prevents the receptor protein from being stabilized in an
active conformation by a partial agonist, such as tramadol or
buprenorphine.
in conclusion, the naloxone-sensitive antinociceptive
responses to two weak partial opioid agonists, buprenorphine
and tramadol, were very markedly accentuated by targeted
inactivation of the  xxxg88xxx  gene in mice. the effects
of alpha2a-ko were mimicked by pretreatment of wild-type control
mice with the  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonists, atipamezole and
yohimbine; the apparent efficacy of tramadol and buprenorphine now approached that of morphine and fentanyl. other
behavioural effects of the tested opioid agonists were not
similarly influenced by alpha2a-ko. the possible mechanisms
for the observed dramatically increased antinociceptive efficacy of partial opioid agonists include reversal of  xxxg88xxx -dependent desensitization of some components of the
common intracellular signaling pathways of alpha2a-adrenoceptors
and mu-opioid receptors, and removal of conformational constraints imposed by hetero-oligomeric alpha2a-adrenoceptors to muopioid receptor activation by partial agonists. antagonists of
alpha2a-adrenoceptors may offer a novel mechanism to augment
the antinociceptive actions of partial opioid agonists.
