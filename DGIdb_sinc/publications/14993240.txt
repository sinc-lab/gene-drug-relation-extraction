abstract we investigated the formation and pharmacology
of prostaglandin e3 (pge3) derived from fish oil  xxxd2318xxx  (epa) in human lung cancer a549 cells. exposure of a549 cells to epa resulted in the rapid formation
and export of pge3. the extracellular ratio of pge3 to
pge2 increased from 0.08 in control cells to 0.8 in cells exposed to epa within 48 h. incubation of epa with cloned
ovine or human recombinant  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) resulted in 13- and 18-fold greater formation of pge3, respectively, than that produced by cox-1. exposure of a549 cells
to 1 m pge3 inhibited cell proliferation by 37.1% (p 
0.05). exposure of normal human bronchial epithelial
(nhbe) cells to pge3, however, had no effect. when a549
cells were exposed to epa (25 m) or a combination of
epa and celecoxib (a selective cox-2 inhibitor), the inhibitory effect of epa on the growth of a549 cells was reversed
by the presence of celecoxib (at both 5 and 10 m). this effect appears to be associated with a 50% reduction of pge3
formation in cells treated with a combination of epa and
celecoxib compared with cells exposed to epa alone.
these data indicate that exposure of lung cancer cells to
epa results in a decrease in the cox-2-mediated formation
of pge2, an increase in the level of pge3, and pge3-mediated inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.—yang, p., d.

[as reviewed in ref. (1)]. in contrast to a large body of evidence indicating that -6 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  such
as aa promote the growth of tumor cells, -3  xxxd2154xxx 
[ xxxd2318xxx  (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid
(dha)] have actually been shown to inhibit tumor cell
proliferation [as reviewed in ref. (2)]. epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse relationship between blood levels of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  derived from fish oils and the risk of
prostate and lung cancers (3–5). however, molecular
mechanisms for the pharmacologic anticancer activity of
epa have not been fully elucidated. a number of studies
have suggested that the anticancer activities of both epa
and dha are associated with their ability to inhibit the
synthesis of 2-series prostaglandins, especially  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) production [as reviewed in ref. (6)]. in contrast to dha, however, epa can actually function as a substrate for cox and result in the synthesis of unique
3-series prostaglandin compounds (7). to date, studies reporting the formation of 3-series prostaglandins by epa
have been performed using normal cells or tissues (8, 9).
fischer and weber (10), for example, provided the first
evidence of in vivo formation of thromboxane a3 and
prostaglandin i3 in humans fed fish oil. in addition, studies conducted in humans have shown that pge3 levels increased by 10-fold in urine after ingestion of cod liver
oil (40 ml/day) for 12 weeks (11).
in contrast to pge2, the biological activity of pge3 has
received little attention. the effect of pge3 on cell growth
has been reported only in normal murine mammary epithelial (12) and 3t3 fibroblast cells (13). both studies
showed that pge2 and pge3 stimulated the growth of nor-

mal cells but that pge3 was much less potent than pge2. a
more recent study has suggested that pge3, unlike pge2,
is not mitogenic to 3t3 fibroblasts (13). to date, however,
the ability of cancer cells or even purified cox enzymes
to form pge3 from epa has not been evaluated. furthermore, the biochemical pharmacology of pge3 in human
cancer cells has not been investigated. in consideration of
the documented higher level of expression of cox-2 in
tumor cells than in normal cells (14), we sought to investigate a) the capability of human lung cancer a549 cells as
well as cloned coxs to form pge3 using epa as a substrate, b) the relative effects of pge2 and pge3 on human
lung cancer cell proliferation, and c) the possible involvement of pge3 as an important factor in epa-mediated
changes in tumor cell growth.
in this study, we found that the level of pge3 was significantly increased after exposing a549 cells to epa. the ability
of cloned human recombinant cox-2 enzyme to form pge3
from epa was much greater than that of cox-1 enzyme. in
contrast to pge2, pge3 inhibited the growth of human lung
tumor cells but not normal human bronchial epithelial
(nhbe) cells. in addition, pge3 antagonized the effect of
pge2 on cancer cell growth. furthermore, the inhibitory ef-

fect of epa on the growth of a549 cells was partially blocked
by celecoxib (5 and 10 m), and this effect was correlated
with a reduced formation of pge3 in these cells.

materials and methods
reagents
pge2, pge3, pge2-d4, anti-cox-1, and anti-cox-2 antibodies
were obtained from cayman chemical co. (ann arbor, mi). acetoxymethyl ester of calcein (calcein am) and 4,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (dapi) fluorescent dyes were purchased from molecular probes (eugene, or). pge2 and pge3 were dissolved in
ethanol/dmso (1:1, v/v) and added directly to cell culture at a
1:1,000 ratio. we purchased methyl-[3h]thymidine (specific activity, 6.7 ci/mmol) from perkin-elmer (boston, ma). unless
otherwise indicated, all other chemicals were purchased from
sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). all solvents were hplc
grade (fisher scientific co., fair lawn, nj).

cell cultures
human nonsmall cell lung cancer a549 cells (atcc, rockville, md) and nhbe cells (clonetics corp., san diego, ca)
were used in this study. a549 cells were cultured in dmem-f12

medium (gibco brl, carlsbad, ca) supplemented with 5%
heat-inactivated fbs (hyclone laboratories, logan, ut), 2-mm
l-glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin
(gibco brl). nhbe cells were grown in bronchial epithelial cell
growth medium (clonetics corp.).

pge2 and pge3 synthesis
a549 cells (1  106) were plated in 100 mm culture dishes in
complete dmem-f12 medium and were allowed to attach overnight. cells were then washed with pbs and treated with epa
(10–50 m), aa (25–50 m), or epa plus aa (50 m each) in
fresh serum-free medium supplemented with 15 m bsa for 24
or 48 h. to determine the time-dependent formation of pge3
from epa, cells were exposed to 50 m epa and incubated for 1,
2, 4, 6, 16, 24, and 48 h. the culture medium was then collected,
and cells were harvested by trypsinization and subjected to prostaglandin extraction.
the production of pge2 or pge3 by cloned cox-1 (ovine) or
cox-2 (ovine or human recombinant) enzymes (cayman chemical co.) was measured by incubation of 10 or 50 m aa or epa,
respectively, with enzymes (15 u) in 0.1 m tris-hcl buffer, ph
8.0, containing 5 mm edta, 2 mm phenol, and 1 m hematin.
the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 n  xxxd1710xxx  before extraction of prostaglandins.

prostaglandin extraction and analysis
intracellular prostaglandins were extracted according to the
method of yang et al. (15). briefly, cell suspensions were washed
with 2 ml of pbs and resuspended in 0.5 ml of pbs. aliquots (40

l) of 1 n  xxxd1710xxx , 5 l of 10%  xxxd398xxx 
(bht), and 20 l of pge2-d4 (100 ng/ml) as an internal standard were added to the cell suspensions or enzymatic reaction
mixtures. prostaglandins were extracted with 2 ml of hexaneethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) three times. the upper organic phases
were pooled and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen at room temperature. all extraction procedures were performed under conditions of minimal light. samples were then
reconstituted in 200 l of methanol/10 mm ammonium acetate
buffer (70:30, v/v), ph 8.5, before analysis by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (lc/ms/ms).
prostaglandins in the cell culture medium were extracted using a solid-phase method. aliquots of 10 l of 10% bht and 20
l of pge2-d4 were added to 1 ml of cell culture medium. the solution was applied to a sep-pak c18 cartridge (waters corp., milford, ma) that had been preconditioned with methanol and water. prostaglandins were eluted with 1 ml of methanol. the
eluate was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the residue was dissolved in 200 l of methanol/10 mm ammonium acetate buffer (70:30, v/v), ph 8.5.
the extracted prostaglandins were quantitated by the lc/
ms/ms method described by yang et al. (15). briefly, lc/ms/
ms was performed using a quattro ultima tandem mass spectrometer (waters corp., milford, ma) equipped with an agilent
hp 1100 binary pump hplc inlet (agilent technologies, palo
alto, ca). the prostaglandins were separated using a 2  150
mm luna 3  phenyl-hexyl analytical column (phenomenex,
torrance, ca). the mobile phase consisted of 10 mm ammonium acetate, ph 8.5, and methanol. the column temperature

the indicated concentrations for 5 min at 37 c. the reaction
was terminated by adding 1 n  xxxd1710xxx  and 0.1% butylated
hydroxytoluene. prostaglandins were extracted and analyzed
by lc/ms/ms. both cox-1 and cox-2 have a similar capacity to use aa as a substrate to produce pge 2. the formation of
pge3 by epa, however, was at least three times greater with
cox-2 than with cox-1. data are presented as means  sd of

was maintained at 50 c, and samples were kept at 4 c during the
analysis. individual analytes were detected using electrospray
negative ionization and multiple reaction monitoring monitoring of the transitions m/z 351 → 271 for pge2, m/z 349 → 269 for
pge3, and m/z 355 → 275 for pge2-d4. fragmentation of all compounds was performed using argon as the collision gas at a collision cell pressure of 2.10  10 3 torr.

cell proliferation assay
the effects of pge2 and pge3 on cell proliferation were studied by determining the incorporation of [3h]thymidine into cellular dna (16). a549 and nhbe cells were grown in their complete medium for 24 h in 24-well culture plates to attain 70–75%
confluence. cells were then serum starved for 24 h before their
use in experiments. three hours before the termination of each
experiment, 1 ci of methyl-[3h]thymidine was added to each
well. after incubation, cells were washed twice with pbs, lysed
with 0.5 n naoh, and neutralized with 0.5 n hcl, and then radioactivity was measured.

western blotting
cox-1 and cox-2 protein expression in cells treated with
epa or aa was assessed by western blotting. cells were harvested
using protein lysis buffer (50 mm tris-hcl, 250 mm nacl, 0.1%
np-40, 25 g/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm pmsf). the protein
concentration in the supernatant fraction was determined using
a protein assay kit (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca). a total
of 100 g of protein was resuspended in 20 l of laemmli sample buffer (bio-rad), boiled for 5 min at 95 c, and run on a
7.5% sds-page gel before being subjected to western blotting.
cox-2 purified protein (cayman chemical co.) was used as the
electrophoresis standard. proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (bio-rad) and subjected to immunoblot analysis. membranes were blocked overnight at 4 c
in 5% skim milk powder diluted in tbs. thereafter, membranes were incubated with either cox-1 or cox-2 antibodies
(1:2,000) (cayman chemical co.) for 2.5 h at room temperature. after transfer, membranes were incubated for 1 h with goat
anti-mouse secondary antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, inc.,
santa cruz, ca). the membranes were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (amersham bioscience, buckinghamshire, uk) and exposed to kodak xar-5™ film.

cell viability and dna staining
cell viability was determined using various treatments or combinations of epa, celecoxib, or sc-560. the assay was performed
using the vital dye calcein am (cam) ester (molecular probes),
which is plasma membrane permeable and nonfluorescent before activation by nonspecific esterases within viable cells. the
cleavage product cam emits green fluorescence that is retained
by viable cells and cells in the early stages of apoptosis. when
plasma membrane integrity is disrupted in the latter stages of
cell death, cells fail to effectively retain cam. cells were plated in
96-well plates and incubated with 25 m epa or aa, sc-560 (0.1
and 0.5 m), and celecoxib (5 and 10 m) and various combinations of epa and sc-560 or celecoxib for 24 h. cells then were incubated with cam ester (1 m), dapi (300 nm), and propium
iodide (pi) (500 nm) (molecular probes) in hepes-buffered saline solution for 15 min at 25 c. nuclear morphology, dna dye
uptake, and cellular staining were assessed by fluorescence microscopy using an iplabs image-analysis system (scanalytics, inc.,
fairfax, va) on an ix70 inverted microscope (olympus, melville, ny) with a quantix charge-coupled device camera (roper
scientific, trenton, nj). fluorescence was quantitated using a
biolumin 9600 well plate reader. cells lysed with 1% np-40 detergent were used as a negative control for cam ester conversion
and as a positive control for dna intercalating dye uptake. cells
used as a viable cell-positive control had intact plasma membranes and converted cam ester to fluorescent cam in a linear
manner. they completely excluded dapi and pi uptake.

statistical analysis
student’s t-test was used to determine the statistical differences between various experimental groups; a value of p  0.05
was considered significant.

results
formation of pge3
the anticancer effect of epa has been linked to the inhibition of cox activity and consequently reduced levels
of pge2 both in vitro and in vivo (17, 18). we have previ-

collected and prostaglandins were extracted and analyzed by

fig. 4. effect of epa on the expression of cox-2 in a549
cells. cells (2  106) were grown in medium supplemented
with 15 m bsa alone or in medium containing epa (25
and 50 m), docosahexaenoic acid (dha; 50 m), and aa
(50 m) for 24 h. cox-2 protein expression was determined
with western blotting as described in materials and methods. all three  xxxd2154xxx  tested induced cox-2 expression.

ously shown that a clinically achievable plasma level of
epa (100 m) (19) results in more than a 50% reduction
in pge2 formation in lung cancer cells (15). because epa
is a substrate for cox (7), we determined the capacity of
lung cancer cells to form pge3 from the -3 fatty acid
epa. when a549 cells were exposed to epa (10 and 50
m) for 48 h, the concentration of pge3 in the cell culture medium significantly increased to as high as 7.98 
1.36 ng/5 million cells compared with that in the control
group (0.44  0.021 ng/5 million cells; p  0.001) (fig.
1a). this increase of extracellular pge3 was concentration dependent. when a549 cells were exposed to 50 m
epa for 48 h, the extracellular ratio of pge3 to pge2 increased from 0.08 in control cells to 0.8 in treated cells
(fig. 1a, inset). the increase in the ratio of pge3 over
pge2 was also concentration dependent.
as shown in fig. 1b, exposure of a549 cells to 50 m
epa for 30 min resulted in a rapid 13-fold increase in
extracellular pge3 level, from 0.85  0.12 ng/5 million
cells in control cells to 12.68  0.77 ng/5 million cells in
treated cells. after incubation with epa for 4 h, the intracellular level of pge3 increased from 0.33  0.021 ng/5
million cells in control cells to 0.88  0.11 ng/5 million
cells in treated cells, whereas the extracellular level of
pge3 reached 24.94  4.62 ng/5 million cells. these data
suggest that a549 human lung cancer cells are able to rapidly produce and export high amounts of pge3. the extracellular peak level of pge3 occurred at 6 h, after which
it declined; by 48 h, levels of pge3 had decreased by at
least 50% from the peak concentration (fig. 1b).
we next asked whether the production of pge3 in a549
cells was the result of cox-1, cox-2, or both enzymes
(a549 cells express both cox-1 and cox-2 protein) (20).
cloned ovine cox-1 and human recombinant cox-2
were used to test for the formation of pge2 or pge3 using
aa and epa, respectively, as substrates. as shown in fig.
2a, both cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes produced pge2 with
comparable efficiency using 10 m aa as a substrate, a
finding previously reported by other investigators (21,
22). in contrast, the formation of pge3 from epa was at
least three times greater with cox-2 than with cox-1
(fig. 2b). with 10 m epa, the relative efficiency of the
enzymes using this substrate to form pge3 was human recombinant cox-2 (61.9  14.2 ng/15 u enzymes)
ovine cox-2 (46.9  8.5 ng/15 u enzymes)
ovine
cox-1 (3.4  1.0 ng/15 u enzymes). overall, the total
production of pge2 was 15- and 3-fold higher with both
1034

journal of lipid research volume 45, 2004

cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes, respectively, than the total
production of pge3 by these enzymes.
the relative ability of a549 cells to form pge2 from aa
while simultaneously being exposed to epa was then de-

expression of cox-2 (b) in a549 cells. a: cells (2  105) were
plated in six-well plates overnight and then treated with epa (25 m)
and celecoxib (5 and 10 m) or epa and sc-560 (0.1 and 0.5 m) for
24 h. the eicosanoids in the medium were extracted and analyzed
as described in the text. celecoxib inhibited the formation of pge 3
in a concentration-dependent manner; however, sc-560 did not alter the levels of pge 3 mediated by epa. data are presented as
means  sd from three separate experiments. * p  0.05 and * * p 

termined. the level of pge2 in cells treated with both aa
and epa (50 m each) decreased by 35% in comparison
with that in cells treated with aa alone (50 m). it was interesting that the formation of pge3 was similar in cells
treated either with epa alone (50 m) or with aa plus
epa (50 m each) (fig. 3).
epa and cox-2 protein expression
because the levels of pge3 increased rapidly after
a549 cells were exposed to epa, the data suggested to us
that the expression of cox-2 protein might be induced.
therefore, we examined the relative abilities of epa and
aa to induce cox-2 protein. a549 cells were exposed to
50 m epa for 2, 4, 6, 16, and 24 h, and induction of
cox-2 protein was determined by western blot analysis.
unexpectedly, the expression of cox-2 protein was not
increased until 16 h. figure 4 shows that 24 h of exposure
of cells to epa (25 and 50 m) induced cox-2 protein
expression in a549 cells in a concentration-dependent
manner. interestingly, dha and aa (50 m) also induced
the expression of cox-2 protein in a549 cells. expression
of cox-1 protein, however, was not altered (data not
shown).
inhibition of pge3 formation by celecoxib but not sc-560
to further confirm that pge3 was enzymatically generated either by cloned enzymes or by cancer cells, the formation of pge3 by epa in the presence of either celecoxib, a selective cox-2 inhibitor, or sc-560, a selective
cox-1 inhibitor, in a549 cells was tested. celecoxib (5
and 10 m) significantly reduced pge3 levels to 4.25 

0.40 and 3.25  0.35 ng/5 million cells, respectively, from
the control cell level of 6.92  0.24 ng/5 million cells (p 
0.05). the inhibition of pge3 formation by celecoxib in
a549 cells was concentration dependent. in comparison,
sc-560 up to 0.5 m, a concentration known to inhibit
95% of cox-1 activity (23), had no effect on the production of pge3 mediated by epa (fig. 5a). we then tested
the inhibitory effect of celecoxib on pge3 formation with
cloned cox-2 enzymes and found that celecoxib (10 m)
also inhibited the production of pge3 by epa by 72%
(data not shown). the expression of cox-2 protein in
epa-treated cells in the presence of celecoxib was also examined. interestingly, when cells were exposed to both
epa and celecoxib, the presence of celecoxib did not alter
the expression of cox-2 protein compared with that in
cells treated with epa alone (fig. 5b).
pge3 and cancer cell proliferation
studies have suggested that pge2 can stimulate colorectal cancer cell growth (16); thus, the effect of both pge 2
and pge3 on human lung cancer cell proliferation was investigated. after a549 cells were exposed to either pge 2
or pge3 for 24 h, pge2 (1 m) produced only a slight increase in cell proliferation, whereas pge3 (1 m) inhibited the growth of these cells by 37.1% (p  0.05) (fig. 6).
addition of pge3 to the pge2-treated a549 cells also led
to a significant reduction in cell proliferation compared
with that in the cells treated with pge2 alone (p  0.05).
the effect of pge3 on a549 cell proliferation was concentration dependent. in contrast to that of a549 cells, expo-

was added, and incorporation of the radioactivity into dna was measured. pge 3 (1 m) significantly inhibited the proliferation of a549 cells. addition of pge 3 to pge2-treated cells blocked the pge2-mediated proliferation of a549 lung cancer cells. data are presented as means  sd of three separate experiments. a p 

sure of nhbe cells to 1 m pge3 reduced the dna synthesis of these cells by only 10%.
celecoxib reversed epa-induced cell death
the role of pge3 in epa-induced cell death was further
examined in a549 cells treated with epa alone and a combination of epa and selective cox inhibitors. a549 cells
were exposed to epa (25 m), aa (25 m), epa and celecoxib (5 and 10 m), and epa and sc-560 (0.1 and 0.5
m) for 24 h. cell viability and apoptosis were detected by
staining the cells with cam and dapi. nuclear morphology was also recorded with a fluorescence microscope.
when cells were exposed to epa (25 m) for 24 h, the
majority of cells were rounded up and appeared to be undergoing apoptosis, as detected by staining with dapi dye
(fig. 7, upper panel). interestingly, when the cells were
exposed to the combination of epa and celecoxib (fig. 7,
middle panel), cell death was reduced dramatically, as indicated by the increased viability of cells detected by calcein am staining (green fluorescence) compared with
treatment with epa alone. in contrast, sc-560 only slightly
affected epa-induced cell death (fig. 7, lower panel). cell
viability and apoptosis were additionally quantitated using
a biolumin 9600 well plate reader. exposure of cells to 25
m epa led to a 63% reduction in cell viability (p  0.05)
and increased apoptotic cells by 5-fold (fig. 8) (p 
0.001) compared with control cells. in contrast, exposure
of cells to a similar concentration of aa did not affect the
growth of a549 cells. furthermore, when cells were exposed to epa and celecoxib (5 and 10 m), the number
of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced by 38% and
56%, respectively, compared with treatment with epa
alone. the reversible effect of celecoxib on epa-induced
cell growth inhibition was concentration dependent. interestingly, sc-560, a selective cox-1 inhibitor, did not
block the inhibitory effect of epa on a549 cell growth
(fig. 8). taken together, these data suggest that the inhibitory effect of epa on the growth of a549 cells might be at
least partially associated with the formation of pge3.

discussion
studies have suggested that altered production of prostaglandins might be associated with the beneficial effects
of the consumption of -3  xxxd2154xxx  (24). in contrast to
data from numerous studies with pge2, little is known of
the pharmacology of and cellular response to pge3.
quantitation of pge3 in biological matrices as well as
within cell culture has been difficult, and this has hampered studies of the relative formation of this unique prostaglandin and its effects on the formation of pge2 within
normal and malignant cell populations.
by applying a selective and sensitive lc/ms/ms method
for the determination of pge3, we previously showed that
pge3 is formed within 5 min of exposure of a549 cells
to epa (15). in the present study, we have demonstrated
for the first time that both human lung cancer cells and

a549 cells (1  104) were plated in a 96-well plate overnight in
dmem-f12 medium. cells were then treated with fresh serum-free
medium with 15 m bsa containing 25 m epa, celecoxib (5 and
10 m), sc-560 (0.1 and 0.5 m), and combinations of epa and
the two inhibitors for 24 h. fluorescence cocktail including calcein
am (cam) ester, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi), and
propium iodide was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature as indicated in materials and methods. cam ester staining
of the esterase in viable cells showed as green fluorescence, and
dapi-counterstained dna in nuclei showed as blue. there was a
remarkable amount of blue staining in the cells treated with epa
alone in comparison with the control cells. however, much more
cam staining appeared in the cells treated with celecoxib and epa
compared with epa alone.

cloned ovine cox-1 and cox-2 and human recombinant
cox-2 enzymes are capable of generating pge3 from epa
in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. in addition, we also found that pge3 inhibited the proliferation
of a549 human lung cancer cells but did not alter the
growth of normal nhbe cells. furthermore, addition of
pge3 to pge2-treated cells resulted in the inhibition of
cell proliferation in a549 cells. our data also demonstrate
that celecoxib can partially block epa-induced cell death,

placed in fresh serum-free medium containing 15 m bsa
and treated with epa or aa (25 m), sc-560, and celecoxib at
conditions described in materials and methods. after 24 h,
fluorescence cocktail was added and fluorescence was quantitated on a biolumin 9600 plate reader as described in materials and methods. epa led to significant increases in the apoptotic cells. when cells were exposed to epa and celecoxib, cell
death induced by epa was reversed by celecoxib, as indicated
by a 50% reduction in apoptotic cells compared with epa
alone. values are averages of two separate experiments with

which, in turn, is associated with a reduced formation of
pge3 in a549 cells.
increased expression of cox-2 protein and the consequent production of pge2 have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of several types of cancer, including colon,
breast, and lung (25). in this study, we used a549 human
lung cancer cells to examine the aa-mediated formation
of pge2 as well as the formation of pge3 from epa. exposure of a549 cells to epa led to an increase in intracellular
pge3 levels that peaked 2 h after the addition of substrate.
it is clear that rapid transport of this 3-series prostaglandin occurred, which led to the maximal level of pge 3 at
4 h in the culture medium. both the intracellular and extracellular levels of pge3, however, were reduced at 6 h.
one explanation for this phenomenon is that pge3 may
be unstable at 37 c. to test this hypothesis, pge2 and
pge3 were incubated with dmem-f12 medium only (i.e.,
without fbs or cells present). the levels of both prostaglandins declined after 6 h of incubation (data not
shown), suggesting that thermal degradation of the prostaglandins had occurred. additionally, pge3 may be further
metabolized by prostaglandin dehydrogenase (26). low
basal or endogenous levels of pge3 in a549 cells were observed in cells that had not been exposed to epa. the explanation for this lies in the fact that the fbs commonly
added to our tissue culture medium contains a trace
amount of epa. we analyzed several lots of fbs sold for
use in tissue culture and found low levels of epa in fbs
from two different commercial sources (data not shown).
although the low levels of epa present in the fbs did not
affect the findings of the reported studies, researchers who
examine cox-related activity in cells in culture should be
aware of epa present in commercially supplied fbs.
in prior investigations of the relative ability of cox to
form 3-series prostaglandins, microsomal preparations
from sheep vesicular glands were used that may have contained a relatively high content of cox-1 as opposed to
cox-2 (27). to clarify the enzyme-specific production of
the products, we examined the formation of both pge 2

and pge3 from cloned cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes. the
production of pge2 by ovine cox-1 and human recombinant cox-2 exposed to aa was similar to that previously
reported (21, 22). in contrast, the formation of pge3 with
human recombinant cox-2 was 5- to 18-fold higher than
that from cox-1 enzyme. these data are consistent with
those reported by laneuville et al. (21) demonstrating
that the rates of oxygenation of epa are three times
greater with intact cell and microsomal preparations of
cox-2 than they are with comparable preparations of
cox-1. in contrast to findings from studies showing that
epa (compared with aa) is a poor substrate for cox-1
and cox-2, as measured by the rate of oxygen uptake
(27), our data suggest that the cox-2-mediated formation of pge3 from epa (61.91  14.34 ng/15 u enzyme)
was only slightly less than the formation of pge2 from aa
(90.11  13.42 ng/15 u enzyme) using human recombinant cox-2. taken together, our data demonstrate that
epa is a better substrate for human cox-2 than it is for
cox-1 enzyme.
it was previously shown that epa and aa induce the expression of cox-2 protein and mrna in keratinocytes
(28) and macrophages (29). we also observed that epa,
dha, and aa (50 m) are all capable of inducing the expression of cox-2 protein in a549 cells in 24 h. in contrast to a previous study demonstrating that the induction
of cox-2 expression in keratinocyte cells occurs within
3 h of treatment (28), we did not observe a significant induction of cox-2 expression by epa in a549 cells until 16
h of treatment. this suggests that the rapid increase of
pge3 in a549 cells (peaking at 4 h) may result from the
metabolism of epa by both cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes in
the cells. even though the levels of cox-2 protein were
increased by exposure of a549 cells to epa, the relative
formation of pge2 by aa in those cells was actually reduced by exposure to epa. the significance of the relative
induction of cox-2 protein expression in the presence of
cox-2 inhibitors, however, is unclear. for example, a
number of in vivo studies have shown that ingestion of
yang et al. pge3 from epa in lung cancer cells

1037

fish oil supplement (containing both epa and dha) inhibited colon or breast mda-mb-231 tumor growth and
that this anticancer effect may have been associated with
the inhibition of expression of cox-2 protein at the tumor site (30, 31). in this study, the addition of aa did not
alter the formation of pge3 by epa in a549 cells. thus,
even though the expression of cox-2 protein may increase within cells, the beneficial effects of epa may involve both a decrease in the cox-2-mediated formation
of pge2 and the unaltered formation of pge3, with its
consequent effects on inhibition of tumor cell growth.
an important observation made in this study was the
ability of pge3 to inhibit the proliferation of a549 human
lung cancer cells. when a549 tumor lung cells were exposed to both prostaglandins, pge2 did not block the inhibitory effect of pge3 on the proliferation of these cells.
more interestingly, celecoxib at 5 m, a concentration
known to produce at least a 50% reduction in pge2 formation in a549 cells (32), partially reversed epa-induced
cell death as indicated by dapi staining. this observation
correlates well with the reduction of pge3 formation in
cells treated with epa and celecoxib. these results indicate that the inhibitory effect of epa on tumor cell proliferation is attributable in part to the formation of pge3,
which actively functions as a suppressor of cell proliferation. other mechanisms have been proposed to explain
the cell growth inhibitory effect of epa. studies have indicated, for example, that dietary epa and dha can induce
compositional changes in colonic mitochondrial membrane phospholipids that may, in turn, facilitate their inhibitory effect on cell proliferation as well as the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells (2, 33). to our knowledge,
this is the first study to demonstrate that pge3 produces
antiproliferative effects on human nonsmall cell lung cancer cells. in contrast to other reports, we did not observe a
significant stimulatory effect of pge2 on the growth of either cancer or normal cells (12, 16). a potential explanation for this is that because the endogenous level of pge 2
within a549 cells is already relatively high (10 ng/5 million cells), the addition of exogenous pge2 may have
been incapable of further stimulating the growth of these
rapidly dividing tumor cells. an additional point is that
the effect of pge2 on cell proliferation may be cell type
specific. for example, pge2 can induce the stimulation of
normal mammary epithelial cell or colon cancer cell
growth (17, 34), yet it may have an antiproliferative effect
on b16 melanoma cells or b lymphocytes (35). nevertheless, the selectivity and specificity of the inhibitory effect
of pge3 on the proliferation of tumor cells is of interest
and warrants further investigation.
in summary, we have found that a549 human lung cancer cells can produce and promptly export pge3 using
epa as a substrate in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. cloned ovine cox-1 and cox-2 and human recombinant cox-2 were all able to generate pge 3
when incubated with epa. however, the ability of cox-2
to form pge3 was much greater than that of cox-1. pge3,
unlike pge2, inhibited the proliferation of human lung
cancer cells and antagonized the effect of pge2 on cell
1038

journal of lipid research volume 45, 2004

proliferation in a549 human lung cancer cells. our newly
developed lc/ms/ms analytical method allowed us to
clearly determine the formation of pge3 in both intact
cells and cell-free systems. therefore, the increased expression of cox-2 protein in cancer cells and the resulting increased production of pge3 from epa may provide
a novel mechanism for the anticancer activity of fish oil
that warrants further investigation.
