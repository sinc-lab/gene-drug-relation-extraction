1 we have investigated pre- and post-junctional responsiveness in vas deferens from wild-type and
a2a/d-adrenoceptor knockout mice. the response to a single stimulus was not signi®cantly dierent
between wild-type and knock-out mice. the isometric contraction to 10 hz stimulation for 4 s was
signi®cantly larger in vas deferens from knockout as compared with wild-type.
2 the maximum potentiation of 10 hz stimulation-evoked contractions by yohimbine was to
206.2+38.0% of control in wild-type but to 135.8+13.6% of control in knockout. the a2a/dadrenoceptor selective antagonist brl 44408 signi®cantly increased the 10 hz stimulation-evoked
contraction in wild-type but not knockout, and the reverse was true for the a2c-adrenoceptor
selective antagonist spiroxatrine. the a2b-adrenoceptor antagonist imiloxan had no eect on the
evoked contraction except at high concentrations, and only in wild-type. following cocaine (3 mm)
and brl 44408 (1 mm), 10 hz responses were similar in shape and maximum between wild-type and
knock-out.
3 the a2-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine virtually abolished the early component of the contraction
to 10 hz stimulation in the presence of nifedipine (10 mm) in vas deferens from knockout mice in a
way consistent with a change of receptor subtype but without clear evidence for a reduced receptor
number. however, the late component of the contraction to 10 hz stimulation was signi®cantly
potentiated by xylazine in tissues from knock-out mice.
4 it is concluded that, although non-a2a/d-adrenoceptors replace a2d-adrenoceptors in this
knockout, the a2-adrenoceptor agonist and antagonist data are contradictory. the antagonist data
suggest a major loss of prejunctional a2-adrenoceptors, but this is not necessarily supported by the
agonist data.

introduction
a2-adrenoceptors have been subdivided into three subtypes,
a2a-, a2b- and a2c-adrenoceptors, based on ligand binding
and molecular cloning studies (bylund, 1992; lorenz et al.,
1990), and the rat a2d-adrenoceptor is a species orthologue of
the human a2a-adrenoceptor (lanier et al., 1991; harrison et
al., 1991a). functional prejunctional a2-adrenoceptors in rat
submandibular gland (smith et al., 1992), rat vas deferens
(smith et al., 1992; smith & docherty, 1992), rat cerebral
cortex (trendelenburg et al., 1993), pithed rat heart (smith et
al., 1995) and mouse atria (wahl et al., 1996), resemble the
a2d-adrenoceptor ligand binding site, whereas those in rabbit
cerebral cortex (trendelenburg et al., 1993) and human
saphenous vein (molderings & gothert, 1995) resemble the
a2a-adrenoceptor.
however, in addition to the a2d-adrenoceptor, a second
subtype of adrenoceptor is found in the rat atrium but not
the cerebral cortex and resembles the a2c-adrenoceptor
subtype (ho et al., 1998). studies in a2-adrenoceptor
knockout mice con®rm that two subtypes of a2-adrenoceptor
are present prejunctionally (hein & kobilka, 1998; scheibner
*author for correspondence; e-mail: docherty@rcsi.ie

et al., 2001). therefore, in a2a/d-adrenoceptor knockout
mice, the prejunctional a2a/d-adrenoceptor is replaced by a
non-a2a/d-adrenoceptor which at least in the heart is an a2cadrenoceptor (altman et al., 1999; trendelenburg et al.,
2001).
the advent of knockout technology has led many
researchers to turn to the mouse, and in this study we wish
to establish the basic parameters of the mouse vas deferens
and how these are aected by knockout of the a2a/dadrenoceptor. it is well established that noradrenaline and
atp are co-transmitters mediating contractions of mouse vas
deferens (allcorn et al., 1986), and acetylcholine may also be
involved (kaschube & zetler, 1988). in mice lacking  xxxg1643xxx 
receptors, contractions of vas deferens to nerve stimulation
are reduced to 60% of normal, and male fertility is reduced
by 90% (mulryan et al., 2000).
we have recently shown that the ability of  xxxd2611xxx  (mdma), which is an a2-adrenoceptor
agonist (lavelle et al., 1999), to inhibit stimulation-evoked
contractions of mouse vas deferens was similar in tissues
from wt and a2a/d-adrenoceptor knockout mice (rajamani
et al., 2001). the object of this study was to investigate
whether changes in prejunctional receptors in the a2a/d-

and antagonists equally.

methods
c57bl/6 black mice (18 ± 28 g) (both wt and homozygous
a2a/d-adrenoceptor knockouts) were obtained as breeding
pairs from the jackson laboratory, bar harbor, ma,
u.s.a.). the ko was originally constructed on a mixed
genetic background (donor strain 129s2; background strain
c57bl/6). all experiments were conducted with a congenic
ko strain generated by repeated backcrossing of the mutation
onto wt c57bl/6 for at least 12 generations.

mouse vas deferens
mice were killed by co2 overdose, and whole vas deferens
(approximately 15 mm long) was dissected out. tissues were
attached to myograph transducers, orientated with the
epididymal portion uppermost, under 0.5 g tension in organ
baths at 378c in krebs ± henseleit solution of the following
composition: (mm): nacl 119; nahco3 25; d-glucose 11.1;
kcl 4.7; cacl2 2.5; kh2po4 1.2;  xxxd2534xxx  1.0. the solution
was bubbled with 5% co2/95% o2. cocaine (3 mm) or
nifedipine (10 mm) was present in some experiments, as
indicated in the text. data acquisition was carried out using
a maclab system.

stimulation-evoked isometric contractions
in experiments investigating the ability of competitive
agonists or antagonists to inhibit or potentiate the isometric
twitch in mouse vas deferens (in the presence of vehicle,
nifedipine 10 mm or cocaine 3 mm), tissues were placed
between platinum electrodes and stimulated every 5 min with
trains of 40 pulses  xxxd1891xxx  hz or a single stimulus pulse (0.5 ms
pulses, supramaximal voltage) to produce isometric contractions. where two tissues from the same animal were used, the
average of the two stimulation-evoked responses was taken in
calculation of control responses to 10 hz 4 s or a single
stimulus. agonists, antagonists or vehicle were added
cumulatively in one log unit increments at 5 min intervals.
an isometric contractile response was obtained following
5 min exposure to each agonist or antagonist concentration,
or following exposure to the vehicle. eects of test drug were
not corrected for changes occurring in experiments in which
repeated additions of vehicle replaced test drug: after ®ve
additions of vehicle the stimulation-evoked contraction was
reduced by less than 10% in wt or knockout.

radioligand binding studies
preparation of rat kidney membranes was carried out as
described in connaughton & docherty (1990), and preparation of rat submandibular gland membranes were as
described for rat kidney. membranes of sf9 cells expressing
human recombinant a2c-adrenoceptors were purchased from
research biochemicals. the resultant pellets were used
immediately or stored at 7208c for later use. pellets were
reconstituted in ®ve volumes (submandibular), 10 volumes
(kidney) or 25 volumes (sf9 cells) of incubation buer.

prejunctional a2-adrenoceptors

in saturation experiments, aliquots of membrane suspension were incubated with various concentrations of [3h]yohimbine (speci®c activity: 81 ci mmole71, amersham) at
258c (rat kidney: 0.5 ± 30 nm; sf9 cells: 0.2 ± 20 nm; rat
submandibular gland: 1.0 ± 40 nm; incubation buer: trishcl 50 mm, edta 5 mm, ph 7.4 at 258c). in competition
studies, [3h]yohimbine (5 or 10 nm) was incubated with
competing ligands in concentrations from 0.1 nm to 1 mm in
0.5 log unit increments for 30 min. non-speci®c binding was
determined in the presence of  xxxd2914xxx  (10 mm). speci®c
binding of [3h]yohimbine was 70 ± 90% of total binding at
the concentration used in displacement experiments. assays
were terminated by washing with ice-cold incubation buer,
followed by rapid vacuum ®ltration through whatman gf/c
®lters, using a brandel cell harvester. radioactivity retained
on ®lters was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy.
the inhibition constant (ki) for inhibition of radiolabelled
ligand binding was determined from the formula:
ki  ic50 = 1  3 h=kd 
where ic50 is the concentration of competing ligand that
inhibits radioligand speci®c binding by 50%, kd is the
dissociation constant for the radioligand yohimbine (rat
kidney: 8.80+0.62 nm, n=7; human recombinant a2cadrenoceptors: 8.7+3.5 nm, n=3; rat submandibular gland:
23.7+2.0 nm, n=4), and [3h] is the concentration of tritiated
yohimbine (5 nm: rat kidney; 10 nm: sf9 cells and rat
submandibular gland).

and graphpad prism for pc.

results
stimulation-evoked isometric contractions in mouse vas
deferens: effects of antagonists
stimulation with a single stimulus produced a monophasic
isometric contraction of 0.053+0.008 g (n=19) and

l. cleary et al

0.059+0.020 g (n=11) in vas deferens from wt and a2a/dadrenoceptor knockout mice, respectively (no signi®cant
dierence) (see table 1).
stimulation with 40 pulses  xxxd1891xxx  hz produced isometric
contractions which tended to dier both qualitatively and
quantitatively between tissues from wt and a2a/d-adrenoceptor knockout. responses in wt in the absence of cocaine
usually consisted of an early sharp peak, a concave decline in
response, and sometimes a late increase in response to a
second peak (in 10 from 92 tissues the second peak was
greater than the ®rst peak) (see figure 1a, although the late
increase occurs after cocaine in this example). responses in
a2a/d-adrenoceptor knockout in the absence of cocaine
usually consisted of a slower rise to peak and a more
rounded and often convex decline in response, and a second
peak was very rare (see figure 1a). however, a number of
traces from knockout animals did resemble the typical wt
response (39 from 102), although the reverse was rarely true
(four from 92). stimulation with 40 pulses  xxxd1891xxx  hz produced
a contraction of 0.50+0.04 g (n=60) and 0.70+0.04 g
(n=56) in wt and knockout mice, respectively (response
was signi®cantly greater in vas from knockout mice:
p50.001) (see table 1). the time to peak contraction (®rst

peak) was 0.83+0.02 s (n=92) and 1.32+0.04 s (n=102) in
tissues from wt and knockout animals, respectively (peak
was signi®cantly later in vas from knockout mice: p50.001).
the non-selective a2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine
(0.01 ± 1 mm) signi®cantly increased the evoked contraction in
both wt and knockout, but the maximum potentiation was
much greater in wt (figure 2). the a2a/d-adrenoceptor
antagonist brl 44408 (0.1 ± 1 mm) signi®cantly increased
contractions evoked by 10 hz stimulation in wt but not in
knockout animals; the reverse was true for the a2cadrenoceptor antagonist spiroxatrine (spiroxatrine 0.01 ±
0.1 mm signi®cantly increased contractions in tissues from
knockout only) (figure 2). the a2b-adrenoceptor selective
antagonist imiloxan signi®cantly increased contractions only
in tissues from wt and only  xxxd1891xxx  mm, a concentration at
which it acts on a2d-adrenoceptors. following yohimbine
(1 mm), the time to peak contraction (®rst peak) was
1.65+0.09 s (n=6) and 1.80+0.14 s (n=6) in tissues from
wt and knockout animals, respectively (no signi®cant
dierence between tissues from wt and knockout, but in
both cases signi®cantly later in the presence than absence of
yohimbine).
the eects of cocaine on responses to a single stimulus and
10 hz 4 s were also examined. cocaine (3 mm) signi®cantly
increased the response to a single stimulus to 298.9+44.6%
of control (n=12) in wt, and to 400.1+51.0% of control
(n=11) in knockout (no signi®cant dierence between wt
and knockout). cocaine (3 mm) slightly, but non-signi®cantly
increased the peak response to 10 hz 4 s to 109.4+3.1% of
control (n=8) (vehicle: 101.6=3.1%, n=6) in wt, and
signi®cantly increased the response to 118.9+4.6% of control
(n=6) (vehicle: 101.8+2.1%, n=8) in knockout (figure 3).
the addition of cocaine (3 mm) produced a clear accentuation
of the convex shape and late peak in wt, but had little eect
on shape of the response in knockout (see right inset to
figure 1a). the eect could be quanti®ed by expressing the
response 1.5 s after beginning stimulation as a percentage of
the response at 1 s: this was 86.4+3.8% (n=11) in vas from
wt prior to cocaine, but signi®cantly reduced to 68.6+6.2%
of control (n=11) following cocaine (cocaine had no
signi®cant eect in knockout; vehicle had no eect in wt
or knockout). in both wt and knockout, cocaine prolonged
the time taken for the response to decline to baseline at the
end of stimulation (figure 1a). the addition of brl 44408
(1 mm) produced a large signi®cant increase in contraction in
wt to 158.1+7.2% of control (n=8) (vehicle: 93.4+2.3%,
n=6), but no further increase in contraction in knockout to
121.0+7.0% of control (n=6) (vehicle: 98.7+4.2%, n=8)
(figure 3). however, the shapes and maximum of the
stimulation-evoked contraction were now similar in tissues

from wt and knockout (figure 1a), with similar times to
peak (1.64+0.08 s, n=16 and 1.69+0.11 s, n=10, in wt
and knockout, respectively). in wt following brl 44408
(1 mm), cocaine (3 mm) had no further eect on the shape or
maximum response (n=3).

effects of xylazine on stimulation-evoked contractions:
cocaine experiments
stimulation with 40 pulses  xxxd1891xxx  hz in the presence of
cocaine (3 mm) produced a contraction of 0.46+0.07 g
(n=11) and 0.70+0.09 g (n=10) in wt and knockout mice,
respectively (response was signi®cantly greater in vas from
knockout mice: p50.001). in the presence of cocaine,
xylazine produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of
the stimulation-evoked contraction in tissues from wt
animals, but potentiated the response in tissues from
knockout animals (figure 4). however, the eects of xylazine
were more complex than the graph suggests: the early part of
the nerve stimulation-evoked contraction was virtually
abolished by xylazine (the response at 0.5 s after beginning
stimulation was reduced by xylazine, 0.1 mm, to 23.9+4.6%
and 51.8+4.9% of control, and by xylazine, 1 mm, to
14.9+5.8% and 18.8+5.7% of control, in tissues from wt
british journal of pharmacology vol 136 (6)

and knockout animals, respectively), and the later part was
more resistant (wt) or even potentiated (knockout) (see
figure 5). the insets to figure 5 demonstrate typical
responses in tissues from a wt and a knockout mouse: note
how the early component of the contraction is markedly
reduced by xylazine (1 or 10 mm) in both wt and knockout,
but the late component is reduced by less than 50% in wt
and is actually potentiated in knockout. the a2d-adrenoceptor antagonist brl 44408 (1 mm) signi®cantly increased the
stimulation-evoked contraction in wt, but had no signi®cant
eect in knockout (see figure 3). however, brl 44408
(1 mm) signi®cantly reduced the potency of xylazine in wt
but not knockout. indeed, brl 44408 prevented the
potentiation by xylazine of contractions to 10 hz stimulation
in knockout mice, presumably by an a1-adrenoceptor
antagonist action to prevent postjunctional actions of
xylazine. given the postjunctional actions of xylazine in
knockout animals in the presence of cocaine, we carried out
experiments in the presence of nifedipine which virtually
eliminates postjunctional actions of agonists in rat vas
deferens (see docherty, 1984).

effects of xylazine on stimulation-evoked contractions:
nifedipine experiments
nifedipine (10 mm) signi®cantly reduced the contraction
evoked by 10 hz stimulation in both wild-type and knockout
(see figure 1b). stimulation with 40 pulses  xxxd1891xxx  hz in the
presence of nifedipine (10 mm) produced a contraction of
0.12+0.02 g (n=24) and 0.20+0.03 g (n=30) in wt and
knockout mice, respectively (response was signi®cantly greater in vas from knockout mice: p50.05). in the presence of
nifedipine, xylazine signi®cantly inhibited stimulation-evoked
contractions in tissues from both types of animal, but the
potency and/or maximum response of xylazine at inhibiting

l. cleary et al

contractions evoked by 10 hz stimulation was signi®cantly
reduced in knockout (4.54+0.17, n=4) as compared with
wt mice (7.01+0.48, n=4) (figure 6). however, even in the
presence of nifedipine, the actions of xylazine in vas from

prejunctional a2-adrenoceptors

861

knockout mice were complex, with again a reduction in the
early part and an increase in the later part of the contraction
(data not shown). brl 44408 (1 mm) signi®cantly increased
the stimulation-evoked contraction to 270.8+65.3% of
control (n=4) in wt, but had no signi®cant eect in
knockout (97.2+12.0% of control, n=4). brl 44408
actually increased the ability of xylazine to inhibit contractions in vas from knockout mice presumably by an a1adrenoceptor antagonist action to prevent post-junctional
actions of xylazine, while reducing the potency of xylazine in
vas from wt (figure 6). however,  xxxd3000xxx  (0.01 mm), a
concentration which reduces the stimulation-evoked contraction to 10 hz 4 s in wt in the absence of nifedipine below
50% of control (authors, unpublished observations) did not
aect the actions of xylazine post-nifedipine in knockout
mice (figure 6). this suggests that even in the presence of
nifedipine, xylazine has some postjunctional actions which
mask its true pre-junctional action, and these post-junctional
actions may be at a2-adrenoceptors, at least in knockout
animals.

contractions are shown at various times (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 s) from
beginning of 10 hz stimulation. note that xylazine inhibits at all time
points in wt, but inhibits at 0.5 ± 1 s and potentiates at 2 ± 4 s in ko
(at least with 1 and 10 mm). vertical bars indicate s.e. of mean from
at least four experiments. the insets show typical isometric responses

a2c- or a2b-adrenoceptors, respectively, whereas brl 44408
showed 30 fold selectivity for a2d sites (table 2).

discussion
in this study, we have looked at a2-adrenoceptor agonist and
antagonist actions against nerve stimulation-evoked contractions in mouse vas deferens and how these are altered in a2a/
d-adrenoceptor knockout mice. let us ®rst consider baseline
responses to nerve stimulation: noradrenaline and atp are
co-transmitters mediating contractions of mouse vas deferens
(allcorn et al., 1986), and acetylcholine may also be involved
(kaschube & zetler, 1988). contractions of mouse vas
deferens to nerve stimulation involve both a1-adrenoceptors
and purinergic  xxxg1643xxx  receptors, so that deletion of the
purinergic receptors greatly reduces the magnitude of the
contraction and the residual response is blocked by  xxxd3000xxx 
(mulryan et al., 2000). in our studies of mouse vas deferens,
 xxxd3000xxx  in low concentrations markedly reduced contractions. in some studies, a residual atropine sensitive contraction remaining after a1-adrenoceptor and purinergic blockade
suggested a cholinergic component to responses (kaschube &
zetler, 1988), but in our studies, the residual response
following  xxxd3000xxx  and the purinergic antagonist  xxxd3266xxx 
was not aected by atropine (authors unpublished results; see
also mulryan et al., 2000).
responses to a single stimulus were unaltered, but 40
pulses  xxxd1891xxx  hz were signi®cantly larger in tissues from
knockout mice as compared to wt following vehicle, cocaine
or nifedipine. although there were exceptions, the shape of
contractile responses to 10 hz tended to have characteristic
dierences between wt and knockout. in general, a sharp
early peak was obtained in tissues from wt, followed by a
concave decline and sometimes a late increase in response. in
tissues from knockout mice, the response was generally more
`rounded' with a signi®cantly later ®rst peak, and a more
convex decline from peak: there was rarely a second peak,
although some responses in vas from knockout did resemble
the typical wt response. in the presence of yohimbine (1 mm)
responses in wt and knockout had similar times to peak and
resembled the typical response in knockout tissues in the
absence of yohimbine. the noradrenaline re-uptake blocker
cocaine (3 mm) changed the shape of the response in wt
tissues, making the response more concave and biphasic by
reducing the magnitude of contraction at 1.5 ± 2 s, presumably by increasing the amount of noradrenaline available to
activate the prejunctional inhibitory a2-adrenoceptors. in
contrast, in tissues from knockout animals, cocaine did not
signi®cantly aect shape of response but caused a small
potentiation of the contraction, presumably by increased

availability of noradrenaline at the post-junctional receptors.
following cocaine and brl 44408, responses were generally
similar in shape and magnitude in tissues from wt and
knockout, and dicult to distinguish. these results with a2adrenoceptor antagonists with or without cocaine might
suggest that diminished prejunctional control of neurotransmission in tissues from knockout animals explains the
prolonged time to peak and increased maximum contraction.
negative feedback by noradrenaline in¯uences contraction
beginning at about 0.7 ± 0.8 s in wt and this inhibition is
ampli®ed by cocaine and diminished by a2-adrenoceptor
antagonists. in knockout, there is still some negative
feedback so that a2-adrenoceptor antagonists could still
signi®cantly delay the peak response and increase the
maximum. it is also possible that a2a/d-adrenoceptors dier
from a2c-adrenoceptors in their temporal characteristics and
this may contribute to dierences between wt and knockout.
returning to cocaine, in vas deferens from both wt and
knockout mice, cocaine prolonged the response to nerve
stimulation by slowing the rate of decline of the response at
the end of stimulation (see figures 1 and 5).
the ability of a2-adrenoceptor antagonists to increase
stimulation-evoked contractions to 40 pulses  xxxd1891xxx  hz by
block of endogenous feedback was investigated. the
relatively non-selective antagonist yohimbine signi®cantly
increased stimulation-evoked contractions in vas deferens
from both wt and knockout, but the degree of potentiation
was much greater in wt. the a2d-adrenoceptor selective
antagonist brl 44408 signi®cantly increased stimulationevoked contractions in wt but not knockout. in ligand
binding studies, brl 44408 is approximately 30 times more
potent at a2d (7.77) than at a2b/a2c (6.11/6.28), so that brl
44408 is likely to act in low concentrations by blocking only
a2d-adrenoceptors. the a2c-adrenoceptor antagonist spiroxatrine 0.01 mm signi®cantly increased stimulation-evoked
contractions in knockout but not wt. in ligand binding
studies, spiroxatrine is approximately 30 ± 300 times more
potent at a2b (7.86) and a2c (9.19) than at a2d (6.41), so that
spiroxatrine is likely to act in low concentrations by blocking
only a2b/a2c-adrenoceptors. a signi®cant eect of spiroxatrine
at 0.01 mm might suggest an a2c-adrenoceptor action, but we
cannot entirely exclude an a2b-action. imiloxan shows
selectivity for a2b- over a2a/d-adrenoceptor subtypes (5 ± 30
fold: michel et al., 1990; devedjian et al., 1994; jasper et al.,
1998) and to a lesser extent over a2c-adrenoceptors (3 ± 10
fold: devedjian et al., 1994; jasper et al., 1998). however,
imiloxan produced eects only in wt and at a concentration
consistent with a2d-adrenoceptor antagonism. the lack of
eect of imiloxan in knockout animals might suggest that a2cadrenoceptors, and not a2b-adrenoceptors, replace the a2dadrenoceptors in vas deferens of knockout. from these
results we can conclude two things. firstly, the prejunctional
a2d-adrenoceptor in vas deferens from wt is replaced by an
a2b/2c-adrenoceptor (probably an a2c-adrenoceptor) in vas
deferens from knockout. indeed, other authors have shown
that an a2c-adrenoceptor replaces the a2d in the heart of the
a2a/d knockout (altman et al., 1999), and found no evidence
for prejunctional a2b-adrenoceptors in knockout studies of
mouse hippocampus (scheibner et al., 2001). secondly, the
ability of antagonists to potentiate contractions is greatly
reduced in vas from knockout mice (approximately 25%
increase versus 60 ± 100% increase in wild-type; present

results). this may suggest that endogenous feedback by
noradrenaline is reduced in tissues from knockout mice and
explains why the contractile response to 10 hz stimulation is
signi®cantly greater in vas from knockout, except following
a2-adrenoceptor blockade.
studies with the a2-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine produced
contradictory results. first of all, let us consider the dierent
experimental conditions employed in agonist experiments:
cocaine or nifedipine. in the presence of cocaine, there was
no large change in the nerve-stimulation evoked response, but
postjunctional actions of agonists are possible. in studies of
responses to a single pulse stimulation in the presence of
cocaine, potency of xylazine was reduced in vas deferens of
knockout mice, whereas potency of mdma ( xxxd2611xxx ) was unchanged (rajamani et al., 2001).
in the present study, the eects of xylazine on 10 hz
stimulation-evoked responses in the presence of cocaine in
vas from knockout mice was complex: inhibition of an early
component of the contraction, but potentiation of the later
component. the potentiation was probably by a postjunctional action. in contrast, in tissues from wt animals,
xylazine inhibited all components of the response although
the later component was inhibited less than the early
component.
in the presence of nifedipine (10 mm), postjunctional
actions of a1-adrenoceptor agonists are virtually abolished
in rat vas deferens (see docherty, 1984), but the present
results suggest that some post-junctional a-adrenoceptor
actions remain in mouse vas deferens. this may suggest
dierences between rat and mouse vas deferens in the
adrenoceptors targeted by exogenous agonists in terms of
the involvement of entry of calcium. in studies of
contractions to 10 hz stimulation in the presence of
nifedipine, xylazine and oxymetazoline (present results and
rajamani et al., 2001) were signi®cantly less potent at
inhibiting stimulation-evoked contractions in vas deferens
from knockout mice, but, perhaps surprisingly, mdma had
similar potency in knockout and wt (rajamani et al., 2001).
the change in receptor subtype was con®rmed by the eects
of brl 44408: the antagonist reduced potency of xylazine in
wild-type but not in knockout (present results). in fact,
xylazine potency was increased in knockout, but this was
probably due to blockade by brl 44408 of some of the
postjunctional actions of high concentrations of xylazine.
however, the a1-adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  at a
concentration which signi®cantly aects nerve-stimulationevoked contractions, did not increase xylazine potency,
suggesting that the above actions of brl 44408 in knockout
animals is by action at a2-adrenoceptors, a2b- or a2cadrenoceptors. hence, even in the presence of nifedipine,
there is a postjunctional component to the response to
xylazine in knockout animals, which may even be a2adrenoceptor mediated. there is previous evidence that a2adrenoceptors are involved in contractions of mouse vas
deferens (bultmann et al., 1991). indeed, in vas from
knockout, xylazine inhibited the early component (0.5 s)
but tended to increase the later component (up to 4 s) of the
contraction to 10 hz stimulation. the lower potency of
xylazine in knockout and the similar potency of mdma can
be explained in terms of diering ligand binding anity for

a2b/2c and a2d. hence, agonist results could be taken to
indicate that number of pre-junctional a2-adrenoceptors is
relatively unchanged in knockout in relation to wild-type.
this contrasts with the antagonist data.
how do we reconcile antagonist and agonist data.
antagonist results clearly show a change from a2d- to a2b/
2c-adrenoceptors and an apparently diminished negative
feedback, suggesting fewer receptors as targets for endogenous noradrenaline. the agonist results are more consistent
with a change in receptor subtype but similar numbers of
receptors. the reduced endogenous feedback by noradrenaline in knockout can be explained by a decreased number of
prejunctional receptors or by a diminished ability of
noradrenaline to interact with the new receptors, either due
to reduced anity/ecacy for the new receptors, or to limited
access to the receptors due to change of location. in ligand
binding studies, noradrenaline has a 2 ± 3 fold higher anity
for a2b/2c than a2d (harrison et al., 1991b), tending to rule
out the former possibility. however, in cultured sympathetic
neurons from 3 day old mice nerve terminal receptors were
found to be a2d, whereas soma-dendritic receptors were a
mixture of a2c and a2d (trendelenburg et al., 2001).
although the soma-dendritic a2c-adrenoceptors reduced
depolarization-evoked calcium currents, they did not seem
to be involved in presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release
(trendelenburg et al., 2001). however, the situation may be
dierent in adult sympathetic neurons, so that soma-dendritic
a2c-adrenoceptors may increase in number in a2a/d-knockout
mice and additionally contribute to agonist but not
antagonist actions in the mouse vas deferens due to their
location distal to the synapse.
how do the results of this study dier from those of
previous studies. firstly, altman et al. (1999) found that the
ability of the a2-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomide to
reduce stimulation-evoked contractions was greatly reduced
in vas deferens from a2a/d-adrenoceptor knock-out mice,
with a much smaller reduction in its ability to inhibit
transmitter release. the present study demonstrates that, in
the absence of nifedipine, prejunctional inhibitory actions of
a2-adrenoceptor agonists are masked by post-junctional
actions in a2a/d-adrenoceptor knockout mice, resulting in
an overestimation of the loss of prejunctional function.
however, like altman et al. (1999), we found that the ability
of antagonists to potentiate evoked contractions was reduced
in tissues from knockout animals. this clearly demonstrates a
decreased number of prejunctional a2-adrenoceptors, or that
the receptors are less accessible to endogenous neurotransmitter while remaining accessible to exogenous agonists.
it is concluded that the prejunctional a2a/d-adrenoceptor is
replaced by the a2b/2c-adrenoceptor (probably the a2cadrenoceptor) in vas deferens from this knockout mouse,
resulting in diminished prejunctional modulation of neurotransmission in terms of a2-adrenoceptor antagonist but not
agonist actions. the reasons for this require further
investigation.
