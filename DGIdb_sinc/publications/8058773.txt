neutrophil-mediated injury in isolated lungs given il-8 intratracheally.

abstract
we found that intrinsic neutrophil  xxxg147xxx  activity was necessary for human neutrophil adherence
and chemotaxis in viro and human neutrophil-mediated acute
edematous injury in isolated perfused rat lungs given  xxxg562xxx  intratracheally. treatment with either  xxxd3554xxx  (a specific
reversible competitive inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx ) or mk886
(a specific irreversible inhibitor of the  xxxg147xxx  activator
protein) prevented stimulated neutrophil adherence and
chemotaxis (but not superoxide anion production) in vitro.
 xxxd3554xxx - or mk886-inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis was not
restored by adding leukotriene b4 in vitro. perfusion with
neutrophils and either  xxxd3554xxx  or mk886, or with mk886pretreated neutrophils (without adding mk886 to the perfusate), also prevented lung ij'ury (reflected by lung weight gain
and lung  xxxd3253xxx  retention) and perfusate leukotriene b4 increases in isolated rat lungs given  xxxg562xxx  intratracheafly.
again, adding leukotriene b4 to the perfusate did not damage
 xxxg562xxx -treated isolated lungs perfused with zileutoninhibited neutrophils. we conclude that intrinsic  xxxg147xxx  activity is required for neutrophil adherence and chemotaxis and neutrophil-mediated lung injury.

neutrophils participate in a vast array of acute and chronic
inflammatory diseases. a prime example is the highly fatal
(50% mortality) adult respiratory distress syndrome, which is
an acute, oxidative edematous lung injury that for unknown
reasons complicates a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary insults (1). patients with this syndrome have increased
bronchoalveolar lavage levels of  xxxg562xxx  (il-8), leukotriene b4 (ltb4), and neutrophils (2-5), but the relationships
of these factors to lung injury are unclear. il-8, a potent
neutrophil chemoattractant (6), potentiates neutrophil  xxxg147xxx  enzyme activity in vitro (7, 20), but it is not
known if the neutrophil "priming" effects of il-8 in vitro are
related to its biological effects in vivo, specifically if and how
il-8 causes tissue injury. the major  xxxg147xxx  product
secreted by neutrophils is ltb4, but a causal link between
increased airway il-8 levels and the recruitment of circulating neutrophils via ltb4 production has not been identified.
furthermore, while ltb4 is the predominant  xxxg147xxx 
product secreted by neutrophils, ltb4 precursors such as
5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene a4
( xxxg1346xxx ), or other  xxxg147xxx  products such as lipoxins,
may play important roles in inflammation (10). finally, the
contribution of intrinsic neutrophil  xxxg147xxx  activity to
neutrophil function has not been determined.
to examine these potential relationships, we hypothesized
that  xxxg147xxx  activation is required for neutrophils to
respond to inflammatory stimuli and that elevated airway
levels of il-8 cause acute edematous lung injury via this
pathway. to test this premise, we examined the effects of
 xxxg147xxx  inhibition on neutrophil function in vitro and

materials and methods
purification of human neutrophils. heparinized blood was
obtained from healthy volunteers. neutrophils were isolated
by using a percoll gradient and differential centrifugation.
each preparation contained highly purified (>99%o) neutrophils that were suspended in hanks'  xxxd2988xxx 
(sigma) at a concentration of 2 x 107/ml.
assessment of neutrophil function in vitro. neutrophil
chemotactic activity was determined by boyden chamber
assay quantitating activity as the number of neutrophils per
five high-power fields (11) after stimulation with zymosanactivated serum or recombinant human il-8 (200 ng/ml,
sandoz). neutrophil adherence was assessed by quantitating
the percentage of neutrophils adhering to nylon fibers (12)
after stimulation with phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma;
10-6 m, sigma). neutrophil superoxide production was determined by quantitating superoxide dismutase-inhibitable
reduction of  xxxg569xxx  (13) in response to pma (10-6 m).
 xxxd3554xxx  [2.5 1lm, abbott, ic50 = 0.5 pm in rat basophil
leukemia cells (14)], mk886 [1 aum, merck, quebec, canada,
ic50 = 102 nm in human neutrophils (15)], or ltb4 (3 nm,
cayman chemicals, ann arbor, mi) were added in some
experiments. both mk886 and  xxxd3554xxx  are highly specific
inhibitors of  xxxg147xxx  and have no other identified
effects on  xxxd208xxx  metabolism. finally,  xxxg147xxx 
activity (calcium ionophore a23187-stimulated ltb4 production) was measured in mk886-pretreated,  xxxd3554xxx -treated,
and control neutrophils.
isolation and perfusion of lungs. after adult male spraguedawley rats (350 + 50 g) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg i.p.), the lungs were excised, buffer-perfused,
and ventilated continuously with a tidal volume of 3 cc at a
rate of 60 per min with 5% c02/21% 02/74% n2. immediately, lungs were perfused essentially blood-free and then
continuously perfused with earle's  xxxd2988xxx 
(sigma) containing  xxxd3253xxx -70 (sigma) (40 g/liter), calcium
chloride (0.265 g/liter),  xxxd2534xxx  (0.09767 g/liter),
 xxxd2988xxx  (0.4 g/liter),  xxxd3213xxx  (6.8 g/liter),
monobasic sodium phosphate (0.122 g/liter), d-glucose (1
g/liter), and sodium bicarbonate (2.2 g/liter), with the final
ph adjusted to 7.40. perfusate (30 cc) was passed through the
lungs to remove residual blood. the system was then closed,
and 30 cc of perfusate was continuously recirculated at a rate
of 40 cc/kg of body wt per min.
isolated lung experimental protocol. after evaluation of 50
ng, 250 ng, 500 ng, and 1 pg of il-8, a dose of 500 ng was
chosen for all subsequent experiments. il-8, diluted in 0.5 cc
of saline, was injected intratracheally immediately upon lung

isolation. after a 20-min equilibration period during which
 xxxd3554xxx  (2.5 ,um) or mk886 (1 ,um) was at times added to the
perfusate, freshly purified human neutrophils (4 x 107) were
added to the perfusate chamber (initial circulating concentration, -1300 neutrophils per ,ul). in other experiments,
neutrophils were preincubated with mk886 (1 ,um) for 20 min
at 28°c, centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min, and then
resuspended in fresh hbss before addition to the perfusate.
finally, in some experiments, ltb4 (final concentration, 3
nm) was added with neutrophils and  xxxd3554xxx  to perfusates of
lungs given il-8 intratracheally. lung weights and pulmonary artery perfusion pressures were monitored continuously
throughout the 60-min experimental protocol with force and
pressure transducers, respectively. after each experiment,
lungs were freeze-clamped in liquid n2, homogenized, and
centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 10 min.  xxxd3253xxx  concentrations
were determined on the supernatants. perfusate samples
were centrifuged at 5000 x g for 5 min, and the supernatants
were removed and stored at -70°c for ltb4 determination.
assessment of lung  xxxd3253xxx  retention. samples of lung
homogenate supernatants were added to a solution of 0.05%
anthrone (sigma) in  xxxd3258xxx , mixed well, and allowed to
equilibrate for 20 min.  xxxd3253xxx  concentrations were determined
by measuring absorbance spectrophotometrically at 627 nm
and represent the total  xxxd3253xxx  retained per lung (16).
assessment of perfusate ltb4 concentrations. ltb4 levels
were determined by enzyme linked immunoassay using antibody to ltb4 (advanced magnetics, cambridge, ma) and
acetylcholinesterase conjugated to ltb4 (17, 18).
statistical analysis. values were compared by analysis of
variance and corrected by the student-newman-keuls test
for differences between groups; a p value of <0.05 was
considered significant.

lated neutrophils in vitro (table 1). however, in contradistinction to the adherence and chemotaxis inhibition,  xxxd3554xxx - or mk886-treated neutrophils stimulated with pma had
the same (p > 0.05) superoxide anion production as control
neutrophils stimulated with pma (table 1). in response to
the calcium ionophore a23187,  xxxd3554xxx -treated neutrophils
released 14.6 ± 6% and mk886-treated neutrophils released
13.8 ± 2.7% as much ltb4 as untreated, a23187-stimulated
control neutrophils in vitro (n = 4).
effect of intratracheal il-8 and neutrophil perfusion on
isolated rat lungs. isolated rat lungs given 50 ng, 250 ng, or
500 ng of il-8 intratracheally and then perfused with neutrophils gained progressively more weight (fig. 1). isolated
rat lungs given 500 ng of il-8 intratracheally and then
perfused with neutrophils had increased (p < 0.05) lung
weights compared with lungs given only il-8, lungs given
only neutrophils, or control lungs (lungs not given il-8 or
neutrophils; fig. 2a). in parallel, isolated rat lungs given il-8
intratracheally and then perfused with neutrophils had increased (p < 0.05) lung  xxxd3253xxx  retention compared with lungs
given only il-8, lungs given only neutrophils, or control
lungs (fig. 2b). along with weight increases and  xxxd3253xxx 
retention, lungs given il-8 and then perfused with neutrophils had increased (p < 0.05) perfusate ltb4 levels compared with lungs given only il-8, lungs given only neutrophils, or control lungs (fig. 2c). pulmonary artery perfusion
pressures increased (1-2 mmhg; 1 mmhg = 133 pa) transiently (5-10 min) after adding neutrophils in all isolated
perfused lungs.

furthermore, adding ltb4 did not increase (p > 0.05) the

injury and perfusate ltb4 increases in lungs given il-8
intratracheally. inhibiting  xxxg147xxx  activity also prevented il-8-stimulated neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro. these
findings suggest a mechanism that links the increased il-8,
ltb4, neutrophils, and oxidative injury that occurs in lungs
of adult respiratory distress syndrome patients (1). specifically, it appears that increased airway il-8 levels recruit
neutrophils via  xxxg147xxx  stimulation. after recruitment, neutrophils, via the oxidant generator nadph oxidase, release oxygen radicals that injure the lung. thus, both
 xxxg147xxx  and nadph-oxidase activity are required,
but neither alone is sufficient, for neutrophil-mediated lung
injury after il-8 administration.
more importantly, we found that intrinsic neutrophil  xxxg147xxx  activity-as opposed to  xxxg147xxx  activity
of other lung cells-is pivotal in il-8-mediated neutrophil
responsivity in vitro and neutrophil-dependent lung injury. (i)
neutrophils pretreated with mk886, which irreversibly
blocked neutrophil  xxxg147xxx  activity, did not injure
lungs given il-8, despite the intact  xxxg147xxx  function in
other lung cells. (ii) adding ltb4 to the perfusate did not
injure lungs given il-8 and then perfused with neutrophils
and  xxxd3554xxx . (iii) adding ltb4 did not restore chemotaxis or
adherence activity to  xxxg147xxx -inhibited neutrophils in
vitro. these results suggest an additional, previously unidentified, intracellular signaling role for  xxxg147xxx  products
that is different than their well-known function as secretory
products (10). in contrast to secreted ltb4, which increases
endothelial adhesiveness and permeability and activates neutrophils, intracellularly generated ltb4 and/or other  xxxg147xxx  products appear to mediate intracellular mechanisms necessary for neutrophil adherence and chemotaxis in
response to inflammatory signals. interestingly, although
some neutrophil-ligand interactions appear to activate  xxxg147xxx , the response is not always ltb4 release, suggesting in another way that intracellular  xxxg147xxx  products participate in neutrophil responsivity (19). if ltb4 were
solely generated for extracellular functions, then adding
ltb4 would have restored chemotaxis activity to zileutonor mk886-treated neutrophils in vitro and injury in il-8treated lungs perfused with neutrophils and  xxxd3554xxx .
although neutrophil binding to a variety of ligands is
associated with  xxxg147xxx  activation (20), a direct link
between intracellular  xxxg147xxx  activity and neutrophil
responsivity has not previously been identified. in leukotriene synthesis,  xxxg147xxx  sequentially converts  xxxd208xxx  to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and  xxxg1346xxx ,
and  xxxg1346xxx  is then converted to ltb4 by the enzyme  xxxg1346xxx 
hydrolase (10).  xxxg1346xxx  is a volatile molecule, and relatively
little is known of its biological function. however,  xxxg1346xxx 
participates cooperatively in leukotriene synthesis involving
neutrophils and erythrocytes (21), endothelial cells (8, 22),
and probably platelets as well (23). neutrophil-derived  xxxg1346xxx 
may also regulate leukotriene metabolism by alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells (8). consistent with our
findings, cytoskeletal rearrangement in neutrophils may be
linked to leukotriene synthesis (9). consequently, intracellular ltb4 and/or  xxxg1346xxx  synthesis appears to be required for
neutrophils to respond to an external stimulus, such as il-8.
the individual role of  xxxg1346xxx  could not, however, be directly
tested because of its extremely short half-life, which did not
permit measurement in this system. in addition to leukotriene
production,  xxxg147xxx  also catalyzes lipoxin formation.
lipoxins are formed by sequential 15-lipoxygenase and  xxxg147xxx  action on  xxxd208xxx . relatively less is
known of their biological actions, although a role in intracellular signaling has been postulated (10). thus, while ltb4 is
the primary secretory product of neutrophil  xxxg147xxx 
activation, one or more proximal products in this pathway

cell biology: guidot et a
may transduce intracellular responsivity to inflammatory
stimuli.
we found that intrinsic neutrophil  xxxg147xxx  activity
is required for human neutrophil adherence and chemotaxis
in vitro and il-8-dependent lung injury in isolated rat lungs
perfused with human neutrophils. recognition of the integral
role of  xxxg147xxx  activity in basic neutrophil responsivity suggests therapeutic possibilities for acute lung injury and
other neutrophil-mediated disorders.
