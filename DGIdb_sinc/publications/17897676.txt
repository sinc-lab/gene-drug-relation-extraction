the role of glu119 in s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx -dependent dna methyltransferase m.hhai-catalyzed dna methylation was studied. glu119
belongs to the highly conserved glu/asn/val motif found in all dna
c5-cytosine methyltransferases, and its importance for m.hhai function
remains untested. we show that formation of the covalent intermediate
between cys81 and the target cytosine requires glu119, since conversion to
ala, asp or gln lowers the rate of methyl transfer 102–106 fold. further,
unlike the wild-type m.hhai, these mutants are not trapped by the substrate
in which the target cytosine is replaced with the mechanism-based inhibitor
 xxxd2119xxx . the dna binding affinity for the glu119asp mutant is
decreased 103 -fold. thus, the ability of the enzyme to stabilize the
extrahelical cytosine is coupled directly to tight dna binding. the
structures of the ternary protein/dna/ xxxd3157xxx  complexes for both
the glu119ala and glu119gln mutants (2.70 å and 2.75 å, respectively)
show that the flipped base is positioned nearly identically with that
observed in the wild-type m.hhai complex. a single water molecule in the
glu119ala structure between ala119 and the extrahelical cytosine n3 is
lacking in the glu119gln and wild-type m.hhai structures, and most likely
accounts for this mutant's partial activity. glu119 has essential roles in
activating the target cytosine for nucleophilic attack and contributes to tight
dna binding.

introduction
s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ) is the most
common biological donor of methyl groups, second
only to atp in the number of biological pathways
that use the cofactor.1  xxxd3156xxx -dependent methyltransferases transfer the methyl group to sulfur,
oxygen, nitrogen and even carbon-based nucleophiles.2 reactions involving carbon-based nucleophiles are noteworthy, in part because of the relative
lack of reactivity of this moiety. the mechanistic
details of how enzymes facilitate the methyl group
transfer from  xxxd3156xxx  are relatively poorly understood, in spite of the availability of numerous high*corresponding author. e-mail address:

resolution structures.3 modeling studies suggest
that a linear arrangement of the nucleophile, the
methyl group and the leaving thioether moiety in
the transition state is preferred, in a classic sn2
reaction mechanism.4 dna methyltransferases are
an important subset of  xxxd3156xxx -dependent enzymes, and modify cytosine (n4 and c5) and adenine
(n6) sequence-specifically, thereby adding epigenetic information onto the dna duplex. bacteria,
plants and animals rely on dna methyltransferase
for a variety of essential processes, including dna
mismatch repair, protection against foreign dna,
control of dna replication, and transcriptional
regulation. dna methyltransferases are the target
of both antibiotic and cancer drug development
efforts.5–8

high resolution,9 and because of the extensive homology to both bacterial and mammalian enzymes,
provides a basis for understanding this broad and
important class of enzymes. m.hhai was the first
 xxxd3156xxx -dependent enzyme whose structure was
determined, making use of the mechanism-based
inhibitor,  xxxd2119xxx ; the proposed enzyme
mechanism and the action of this inhibitor are
shown in figure 1.10 importantly, the target cytosine
is stabilized into the active site of the enzyme in an
extrahelical position, referred to as base flipping,
and we demonstrated recently that tight dna
binding requires this base flipping step.11 aspects
of the mechanism shown in figure 1 for m.hhai and
by inference thought to be applicable to all dna
cytosine methyltransferases, are well established,
while others are proposed, but little data is available. the involvement of the active site cysteine in
a covalent linkage to the cytosine via the c6 position is essential.12–14 however, the importance of
the ring activation by glu119 remains largely unknown, and was questioned recently on the basis of
computational calculations.15 we showed recently
that arg165 is important for catalysis,9 due largely
to its role in orienting the cytosine correctly for
nucleophile attack.
we replaced glu119 with ala, asp, and gln, and
characterized the mutants at the structural and
functional levels. our results strongly support the
catalytic importance of glu119 in facilitating the first
step in the catalytic mechanism, nucleophilic attack.
moreover, glu119 is essential for the stabilization of

glutamate 119 in m.hhal-catalyzed dna methylation

the extrahelical cytosine and therefore, tight dna
binding. these results provide the first experimental
evidence for the importance of this residue for
m.hhai, and for dna cytosine methylation in general.

results
glu119 in m.hhai is in the highly conserved
catalytic glu/asn/val motif, found in both bacterial
and eukaryotic dna cytosine methyltransferases.
we investigated the importance of glu119 by
converting it to alanine, aspartate, and glutamine.
the mutated m.hhai genes were sequenced and
were confirmed to contain only the desired substitution. the mutant proteins were purified to
greater than 95% purity as determined by densitometry. the functional consequences of these substitutions were examined at the level of catalysis,
dna-binding affinity, and covalent complex formation. in addition, we determined the structures of
two mutant complexes, glu119ala m.hhai/dna/
 xxxd3157xxx  and glu119gln m.hhai/dna/ xxxd3157xxx .
steady-state measurements
apparent catalytic turnover constants (kcatapparent)
were obtained by a burst assay for the wild-type
(wt) m.hhai (table 1; figure 2(a)) and by a steadystate assay for glu119 → ala, asp, gln (table 1;
figure 2(b)). all data were fit to a linear equation.
the burst magnitude for each assay obtained by

figure 1. proposed (a) catalytic and (b) inactivation mechanisms. (a) the c5 of cytosine is poorly nucleophilic towards
the methyl group of  xxxd3156xxx . activation of the cytosine ring by protonation (in this case postulated to involve glu119) at
the endocyclic n3 position is followed by cys81-sh (or thiolate) attack onto the c6 carbon (step1, kattack), yielding a
covalent intermediate between the dna and enzyme. electron flow back into the pyrimidine ring leads to activation of
the cytosine c5 position, which attacks the  xxxd3156xxx  methyl group (step2, kmethyltransfer). the resulting “dihydro-cysteine”
derivative is resolved via abstracting a proton from the c5 position leading to the elimination of the enzyme-sh, reestablishing the aromatic pyrimdine (step3, kelimination, e2 elimination reaction).13 (b) the latter step is blocked, and the
corresponding covalent intermediate is trapped when the target base is replaced with mechanism-based inhibitor
 xxxd2119xxx .19 (the images were created with chemdraw).

extrapolating to zero time was used to determine
the concentration of active wt m.hhai enzyme.16
the burst is caused by rapid methylation (kmethyltansfer)
followed by a slower product release step
(figure 2(a)).11,17 the kcatapparent values were obtained
from the linear portion of the product versus time
profiles. glu119gln m.hhai had no detectable activity in this assay (table 1, figure 2(b)); we estimate that
the activity of this mutant is at least 106-fold lower
than that of the wt enzyme. the kcatapparent for
glu119asp and glu119ala m.hhai are decreased
300-fold and 500-fold, respectively (table1; figure
2(b)) relative to the wt m.hhai. no change in the
kcatapparent was detected when the dna concentration was increased threefold from 1 mum to 3 mum
(data not shown), suggesting that the mutants were
saturated with dna under these conditions.
single-turnover measurements
single-turnover experiments probe specific catalytic steps that are not revealed by steady state

kinetics.17 the unmethylated 30-mer abox dna
(sequence are shown in the oligonucleotide synthesis and purification section) was used to determine
kmethylation, which includes all steps up to and including methyltransfer; we demonstrated recently
that kmethylation is limited by methyltransfer for
m.hhai.18 compared to wt m.hhai, kmethylation is
decreased 10 3 -fold(glu119ala) and 10 2 -fold
(glu119asp). glu119gln m.hhai shows no detectable activity with this assay, and we estimate that
kmethylation for this mutant is at least 106-fold lower
than for wt m.hhai (table 1).
dna equilibrium dissociation constants
to investigate the importance of glu119 towards
the stabilization of the extrahelical cytosine and thus
the stability of the protein/dna complex, we determined the dna dissociation constants (kd dna)
with several substrates, using a gel mobility-shift
assay (figure 3; table 2). the dissociation constants
for the unmethylated abox dna (kd dna-abox ) for
the three mutants are all in the 1–100 nm range and
thus ∼10–103-fold worse than the wt m.hhai. the
protein/dna complexes show significant smearing
at the higher concentrations of protein, consistent
with rapid binding and dissociation kinetics for the
protein/dna complexes (e.g. glu119asp m.hhai
(figure 3(b))). similar analysis of the ambox dna
containing a methylated cytosine at target site in
one strand (kd dna-ambox ) shows that glu119asp
and glu119gln m.hhai dna binding affinities are
∼100-fold altered from the wt m.hhai, whereas
glu119ala m.hhai is tenfold decreased in binding
affinity relative to the wt enzyme (figure 3(a);
table 2). furthermore, the binding of the three
mutants to the hemimethylated dna in which the
target cytosine is replaced by an abasic sugar in one
strand show significantly different affinities
(kd dna-abmbox ) (figure 3(a) and (b); table 2).

one strand. abmbox contains a methylated target cytosine in one strand and an abasic moiety in place of the target

glu119ala and glu119asp m.hhai have affinities

∼60-fold worse binding. the dissociation constant
of glu119asp m.hhai with abmbox dna substrate is similar to the dissociation constant of wt
m.hhai with abox dna (∼100 pm). this mutant

has binding characteristics similar to our previous results with val121ala m.hhai,11 showing
that tight dna binding and base flipping are
coupled.

assay (see the following section), we also measured
kddna-uambox for glu119gln. uambox contains a
methylated cytosine at the target position in one
strand and uridine in the opposite strand. the
kddna-uambox = ∼1.3 nm, which is only ∼20-fold
decreased compared to wt m.hhai binding to the
same dna (figure 3(c); table 2).
covalent complex formation
dna c5-cytosine methyltransferases form irreversible covalent complexes with substrates containing a  xxxd2119xxx  at the target position (figure
1(b)).19 fambox dna contains  xxxd2119xxx 
within the m.hhai gcgc target site (the dna
sequence is shown in the oligonucleotide synthesis
and purification section). the wt m.hhai covalent
complex is observed within minutes of incubation
(figure 4). two bands are observed by sds-page
(10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel), and we suggest
that the bands are most likely due to covalent
complexes with both the single-stranded and double-stranded forms of the dna, since the covalent
complexes denatured by boiling and detergent were
present in the denaturing gels. 20 no covalent
complex was observed with the glu119 mutants in
the short incubation regime (figure 4). when the
incubation time was extended to hours, a significant
increase in covalent trapping of the wt enzyme was
seen, and small but reproducible levels of complex
were observed with all glu119 variants. we estimate
from this analysis that kinactivation for the mutants is
at least 103-fold lower compared to that of the wt
enzyme (table 1).

mutants is significantly slower than wt m.hhai. (a) three

and lower (covalent complex b) bands most likely
correspond to double-stranded and single-stranded dna,
respectively.20 (b) the 180 min assay. in each case, the
radiolabeled hemimethylated duplex fambox (2.5 nm)
was incubated with 25 nm enzyme in mr buffer containing 50 mum  xxxd3156xxx  for 3 ∼ 180 min, depending on the
enzyme being studied, at 37 °c. the sample was subjected
to denaturing sds-page (10% polyacrylamide gel).

structure analysis
we determined the glu119ala and glu119gln
m.hhai/dna/ xxxd3157xxx  ternary cocrystal structures to better understand the structural basis for
the observed changes in enzyme catalysis, in dnabinding affinity and the covalent complex formation. cocrystals were obtained with protein, dna,
and  xxxd3157xxx  ( xxxd3157xxx ), and diffracted to 2.70 å and 2.75 å for the glu119ala and
glu119gln m.hhai/dna/ xxxd3157xxx  structures,
respectively (table 3). the wt m.hhai/dna/
 xxxd3157xxx  cocrystal structure9 (pdb 2hr1) in which
the glu119 residue was truncated to ala, or gln was
used as the initial phasing model in the structure
determination process. the overall protein and
dna structures are not perturbed significantly
from the wt. the rmsd, calculated by superimposing the protein backbones between the wt
m.hhai (pdb 2hr1) structure and the two glu119
variant structures, is ∼0.20 å. thus, both glu119ala
and glu119gln m.hhai cocrystal structures have
retained an overall structure very similar to the wt
structure. the active site residues for both
glu119ala and glu119gln m.hhai are positioned
almost identically with that observed with the wt
m.hhai (figure 5). inspection of the glu119ala
m.hhai structure reveals three water molecules near
the space between the ala119 and flipped out base
(figure 6); two of these, water2 and water3, were
observed in the wt m.hhai structures.9,21 a single
water molecule was observed between the sidechain of the ala119 residue and the flipped out
cytosine base (water1 shown in figure 6). in order to
verify the significance of this newly observed water,
we compared the 2fo – fc electron density map and
the simulated annealing omitted fo – fc electron
density map (figure 7), which was created by
omitting the structural factors of this single water
and a 4.0 å sphere of the region surrounding this
water molecule during the calculations. in this
simulated annealing omitted fo – fc map (figure
7(b)), the highest sigma intensity appearing in this
water electron density map is ∼6.06. thus, these
results suggest strongly that a single water molecule
exists in the space between the flipped out base and
the side-chain of ala119.
this single water molecule contacts the n3
nitrogen and the n4 nitrogen of the extrahelical
cytosine. water1 is ∼2.97 å from the n3 nitrogen
and ∼ 3.15 å from the n4 nitrogen (figure 6);
similar distances are observed for the two oxygen
atoms of the glu119 carboxyl group to the n3
(∼2.92 å) and n4 (∼2.77 å) nitrogen in the wt
m.hhai protein (figure 5(a)). water1 forms interactions with water2 (∼3.38 å) and other atoms in the
active site (figure 6).
gln119 within the glu119gln m.hhai structure is
positioned identically with the glu119 residue in the
wt m.hhai structure (figure 5(b)). the nitrogen and
oxygen of the gln119 amide functional group
have contacts to the n3 (3.13 å) and n4 (2.68 å) nitrogen respectively of the flipped out cytosine base.

methylation analysis of glu119gln m.hhai with a
substrate containing uridine at the target site
 xxxg2366xxx  shares many mechanistic
features with dna cytosine methyltransferases.22
an invariant asparagine residue in thymidylate
synthase forms two hydrogen bonds to the n3 and
o4 atoms of its substrate dump.23,24 mutation of this
asparagine residue into aspartate or glutamate
converts the  xxxg2366xxx  into a deoxycytidylate methylase operating on dcmp. 22,25 no
similar activity of the glu119gln m.hhai with a
30-mer dna duplex containing uridine at the target
position (the sequence is shown in the oligonucleotide synthesis and purification section) was detected.
we estimate that our assay can measure the
methylation of uridine at least 106-fold lower than
for cytosine, so the mutant appears to be inactive or
very inefficient when the target base is uridine. this
result is consistent with an unpublished result.21

discussion
in spite of their widespread appearance and
biological importance, a full mechanistic understanding of how  xxxd3156xxx -dependent enzymes facilitate methyltransfer remains incomplete.2,26–28 in
particular, details of the precise roles of active site
residues for even the structurally well-characterized
members of these enzymes, including the dna
cytosine methyltransferases (figure 1) remain largely

unassigned. dna c5-cytosine methyltransferases
activate the pyrimidine ring through covalent catalysis (figure 1(a)), which is postulated to involve a
transient ring protonation at the endocyclic nitrogen
n3. 29 based on the original m.hhai cocrystal
structure, this activation was proposed to involve
protonation of the cytosine n3 by glu119.21 nevertheless, the need for such activation was challenged
recently by computational work on m.hhai.15 we
replaced glu119 with three residues (glu → ala,
glu → asp, and glu → gln); the kcatapparent for
glu119gln m.hhai is at least 106-fold lower than
that of the wt enzyme, whereas the kcatapparent s for
glu119ala and glu119asp m.hhai are decreased
500-fold and 300-fold, respectively. similar decreases
are observed in the single-turnover methylation
constants (table 1). these results strongly support a
significant catalytic role for glu119.
an independent assessment of the catalytic
competence of these mutants was made through
the use of the mechanism-based inhibitor,  xxxd2119xxx -containing dna (fambox dna) (figure
1(b)). catalysis with this dna and wt m.hhai is
significantly slower than the normal cytosine-containing substrate (table 1),11 most likely due to the
slower rate of attack on the methylsulfonium from
the covalent intermediate.18,30,31 the use of this
inhibitor provides kinetic information about steps
before the elimination step (figure 1). the inactivation kinetic constants with the three mutants are at
least 103-fold slower than that observed with the wt
(table 1). these results differ significantly from those
of a recent study of the mammalian dna cytosine
methyltransferase, dnmt3alpha, showing that replacement of glu752 within the glu/asn/val motif
(equivalent to glu119 in m.hhai), does not disrupt
the ability of the mutants to form the covalent intermediate, although the mutants are nearly inactive
with respect to methylation.32 in contrast, our results
show that covalent complex formation and methylation for m.hhai require glu119. given the highly
conserved nature of the active site motifs between
m.hhai and all known bacterial and mammalian
dna cytosine methyltransferases (including the
glu/asn/val motif, involving both glu119 for
m.hhai and glu752 for dnmt3alpha), it remains unclear
how to reconcile these findings.28,33–35 interestingly,
kinactivation for glu119ala m.hhai is tenfold faster
than the glu119asp m.hhai and kmethylation is
tenfold slower, suggesting a change in rate-limiting
steps between the two enzymes.
dna c5-cytosine methyltransferases are thought
to be mechanistically similar to  xxxg2366xxx  (ts), which also catalyzes one carbon transfers
to the c5 of pyrimidines.22 an invariant asparagine
in  xxxg2366xxx  forms two hydrogen bonds
to the n3 and o4 atoms of its substrate dump.23,24
mutation of this asparagine to aspartate or glutamate converts the  xxxg2366xxx  into a
deoxycytidylate methylase, with activity towards
dcmp. in contrast, glu119gln m.hhai is inactive
with a substrate in which the target cytosine is
replaced with uridine; the sensitivity of our assay is

such that this activity is at least 106-fold less than
with the normal substrate. thus, unlike ts, which
appears to rely on the invariant asn:pyrimidine
interactions largely for specificity, 36,37 m.hhai
appears to require activation of the pyrimidine via
the acidic side-chain, which is not possible with the
gln/uridine pair.
in order to better understand the structural basis
of the significant decreases in activity resulting from
the glu119 replacements, we determined two mutant ternary structures, glu119ala m.hhai/dna/
 xxxd3157xxx  and glu119gln m.hhai/dna/ xxxd3157xxx .
the active site residues for both glu119ala and
glu119gln m.hhai are positioned almost identically
with that observed with the wt m.hhai (figure 5).
although this might suggest that glu119 is unimportant for the correct positioning of the extrahelical
cytosine, both structures suggest how glu119 may

contribute to this function. the glu119ala m.hhai
structure reveals a new water molecule, involved in
a network of active site interactions (figure 6). we
suggest that this network may replace the role of the
original glu119 and correctly position the flipped
out base. additionally, the interactions between
gln119 and the flipped out cytosine base in the
glu119gln m.hhai also appear to stabilize the
extrahelical base in an orientation very similar to
that observed in the wt m.hhai. the dna-binding
affinities for the various enzyme/dna/ xxxd3157xxx 
complexes (figure 3; table 2) largely support such a
positioning role for glu119; the ala and gln
substitutions result in mutants that bind abox
dna slightly better than the asp substitution, and
the ala substitution results in better binding to the
hemimethylated and abasic substrates than either
asp or gln substitution.

1165

glutamate 119 in m.hhal-catalyzed dna methylation

although the glu119gln m.hhai structure shows
that the active site residues retain orientations
similar to those observed for the wt enzyme, this
structure provides insights into why glu119gln
m.hhai is dramatically decreased in catalysis
compared to wt m.hhai. importantly, the amide
of the gln119 side-chain is positioned 3.23 å away
from the cytosine n3, similar to that observed in the
wt complex (figure 5(b)). we suggest that, consistent with earlier predictions for the mechanism
(figure 1(a)), the gln side-chain, unlike the glu sidechain, is incapable of activating the pyrimidine for
nucleophilic attack (table 1).
our finding of the newly identified water in
glu119ala m.hhai may also address why this mutant is less impacted in both dna binding and
catalysis than the glu119gln mutant. we suggest
that this water interacts with the n3 of the flipped
out cytosine, thereby correctly orienting the base, as
observed in the cocrystal structure. even though
clearly not capable of providing the same protondonating role as the glu119 side-chain, this water,
which is found only in the glu119ala m.hhai cocrystal structure, may also form the basis of the residual activity we observe with this mutant (table 1).
the replacement of glu119 with asp shortens the
side-chain by 1.5 å, and structural analysis of the
wt enzyme shows that this shortening is wellaccommodated in the active site of the m.hhai
protein. this mutant is 270-fold less active than the
wt enzyme (kcatapparent , table 1), further supporting
a catalytic role for this residue.
we recently identified a motif within m.hhai and
other base flipping enzymes,11 and showed that any
interaction that interferes with base flipping dramatically impairs tight dna binding. because of these
earlier findings, we probed how the glu119 substitutions affect cognate dna-binding affinity.
replacement of glu119 with ala, asp, or gln causes
decreases in dna-binding affinity (up to 1000-fold,
figure 3; table 2), observed with cognate dna,
hemimethylated dna, and with dna in which the
target base is removed. glu119ala shows the
smallest effects, most likely because the newly
identified water molecule and its network within
the active site partially replace the role of the glu119
in the wt enzyme.
the glu119gln structure (figure 5(b)) also suggests
a basis for the ∼102-fold decrease in abox dnabinding affinity relative to the wt m.hhai. although
the residues that decorate the active site are nearly
identical in this mutant and the wt enzymes, some
differences between the amide side-chain of gln119
and the flipped cytosine are observed. thus, on the
basis of the distances between the nepsilon2 of the gln119
amide group and the n3 of the flipped out cytosine
base, we suggest that this interaction is weaker
than the corresponding h-bond (o · h · n) between
the oepsilon2 of glu119 and the n3 of the extrahelical target
base in wt m.hhai. further, the gln119 amide nepsilon2
and the n3 of the extrahelical cytosine may actually
be involved in an energetically unfavorable interaction. the ∼103-fold loss of dna-binding affinity

observed with the glu119asp substitution (table 1)
most likely derives from the longer distance between
the carboxyl moiety and the n3 and n4 of the flipped
cytosine (4.0 ∼4.5 å versus 2.5 ∼3.0 å). interestingly,
most of this dna-binding affinity is recovered when
the mutant is presented with abasic dna (abmbox
dna), which is similar to our previous observations
with other mutants severely impacted in their ability
to bind dna.
our functional and structural analysis of the role
of a highly conserved acidic residue within the
m.hhai active site (glu119) provides insights into
this  xxxd3156xxx -dependent reaction. glu119 is important for catalysis and, surprisingly, is essential for
positioning and stabilizing the extrahelical cytosine,
as well as tight dna binding. the extrahelical
cytosine in the two mutant structures is oriented
remarkably similar to that observed in the wt
protein/dna complex. however, ala119 m.hhai
retains some catalytic ability and orients the cytosine
correctly because of a newly identified water
molecule that partially compensates for the loss of
the carboxylate side-chain (figure 6).
a recent computational study of m.hhai15 proposed a plausible concerted catalytic mechanism,
without need for activation from glu119, which
argues against the conventional mechanism.28,33,34
our results support a direct catalytic role for glu119,
on the basis of three independent measures of catalysis, using three substitutions at this site. our results
suggest, as predicted by the computational study,
that glu119 is important for positioning of the cytosine. our work supports the involvement of acid/
base chemistry in an  xxxd3156xxx -dependent methyltransfer reaction, and provides a structural basis for
this role.

materials and methods
site-directed mutagenesis, protein expression, and
purification
glu119 m.hhai mutants (glu → ala, glu → asp,
glu → gln) were constructed using the quikchange pcr
mutagenesis kit (stratagene) with the vector phshw-5 as
a template and three sets of pcr primers (integrated dna
technologies).17 pcr products were digested (dpni) to
remove any wt plasmid, transformed via heat shock into
competent escherichia coli strain er1727, and plated onto
agar plates supplemented with 100 mug/ml of ampicillin.
sequencing of dna from individual colonies was done by
the university of illinois, urbana champaign biotechnology center (urbana, il). the glu119 m.hhai variants
were over-expressed by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-betad-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg), at an a600 of 0.4. cells
were harvested centrifugally, proteins were purified as
described,17 and were typically greater than 95% pure as
determined by densitometry. the purified proteins were
stored at −80 °c with 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.3–0.4 m nacl,
10 mm potassium phosphate (ph 6.8), 1 mm edta and
1 mm  xxxd26xxx . for crystallization trials, the
enzyme was concentrated by amicon filtration to 10–
15 mg/ml in 10 mm hepes (ph 7.5), 200 mm nacl, 5 mm
edta, and 1 mm dtt.

oligonucleotide synthesis and purification

steady-state and single-turnover assays

oligonucleotides used for kinetic analysis, binding
affinity and covalent complex formation incorporated a
single m.hhai recognition site but with variations at the
target site. the 30-mer substrates are based on the
unmethylated abox dna with the internal cytosine in
the recognition sequence (underlined) as the target base,

the kcat apparent (apparent kcat ) values were determined
with radiometric assay as described.11 [3h] xxxd3156xxx  was
incubated with dna and enzyme for ∼2 min for the wt
m.hhai and 80 min for the glu119ala, glu119asp, and
glu119gln m.hhai proteins (figure 2). the reaction was
quenched by spotting the reaction mixture onto a de81
filter-paper and rapidly washing the filter-paper in
phosphate buffer. the incorporation of [3h]methyl groups
on dna was monitored by measuring tritium on
de81filter-papers.
single-turnover assays16,17 to determine kmethylation were
carried out with unmethylated abox dna (200 nm) and
 xxxd3156xxx  (5 mum) in mr buffer and incubated at 37 °c.
reactions were initiated by the addition of excess enzyme
(2.0 mum) and the time-points for assay were 0, 1 min,
2 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 60 min, and
80 min, quenched in a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v)
sds, and spotted onto de-81 filters for analysis. sigmaplot
was used to fit all single-turnover data.

covalent complex formation
substrate oligonucleotides retaining the trityl group
were synthesized by midland dna (midland, tx) and
purified on a dynamax puredna hplc column (rainin
instrument co.) according to the manufacturer's specification. oligonucleotides were stored in te buffer (10 mm
tris (ph 8.0), 1 mm edta). concentrations were
determined photometrically by using calculated extinction coefficients.17 oligonucleotide duplexes were formed
by annealing the single strands (∼4 mg/ml) in te buffer
with 10 mm nacl and heated to 95 °c for 5 min before
being cooled slowly to room temperature. for gel
mobility-shift assays, dna substrates were radiolabeled
with [gamma-32p]atp (amersham bioscience) and bacteriophage t4 polynucleotide kinase (t4- xxxg1720xxx , new england
biolabs).
dna-binding affinity
dna affinities (kddna), were determined as described,11
by mixing increasing amounts of enzyme with four
different 32p-radiolabeled duplex dna substrates, abox,
ambox, abmbox and uambox, and  xxxd3157xxx  (sigma). the
same concentrations of  xxxd3157xxx  (10 mum) and radiolabeled
dna oligonucleotides (50 pm) were used for all dnabinding affinity assays (figure 3). for kddna-abox, the
following enzyme concentrations were used: glu119ala,
20 pm–10 nm; glu119asp, 5 nm–800 nm; glu119gln,
500pm–200 nm. for k ddna-ambox , the following
enzyme concentrations were used; glu119ala, 5pm–
5 nm; glu119asp and glu119gln, 100pm–50 nm. for
kddna-abmbox, the following enzyme concentrations
were used: glu119ala, 5pm–500pm; glu119asp, 5pm–
1 nm; glu119gln, 5pm–20 nm; wt m.hhai, 5pm–500pm.
for kddna-uabox, only the wt and glu119gln enzymes
(20pm–100 nm) were used. all samples were incubated at
room temperature for 15 min in methylation reaction (mr)
buffer (100 mm tris (ph 8.0), 10 mm edta, 10 mm dtt,
0.2 mg/ml of bsa) and then loaded onto a pre-run, nondenaturing 12% (w/v) polyarcylamide gel. gels were run
at 300 v for ∼240 min at 4 °c and analyzed using a strom
840 densitometer (amersham bioscience). densitometry
was performed using program imagej. sigmaplot was used
to obtain kddna values by fitting the data to a rectangular
hyperbola curve.9,11,38

dna containing  xxxd2119xxx  in place of cytosine for
the target base leads to the formation of covalent complexes
with m.hhai.19,39 the hemimethylated duplex fambox
(2.5 nm) (midlands tx, sequence shown in oligonucleotide
synthesis and purification section) was radiolabeled using
t4- xxxg1720xxx  (new england biolabs) and [gamma-32p] atp (amersham bioscience); this dna was incubated with 25 nm
enzyme in mr buffer containing 50 mum  xxxd3156xxx  (sigma)
for 3 min to ∼3 h, depending on the enzyme being studied,
at 37 °c in a total volume of 20 mul. then, 5mul of sds-page
loading buffer (300 mm tris–hcl (ph 6.5), 12% sds, 0.6%
(w/v) bromophenol blue, and 60% glycerol) was added,
the samples were heated to 95 °c for 5–10 min and were
subjected to a denaturing sds-page (4% polyacrylamide
stacking gel, resolving gel 10% polyacrylamide). the
incorporation of radioactivity into the protein/dna
complex was analyzed using a molecular dynamic imager.
kinactivation for the wt enzyme was determined directly;11
however, only an upper limit for the mutants could be
estimated due to the very low rates of covalent complex
formation. all inactivation conditions are identical for the
wt and mutant enzymes involving excess dna and
 xxxd3156xxx , thus providing pseudo-first-order conditions. we
used densitometry to quantify complex formations (covalent complexes a and b, see figure 4) and the upper limit for
kinactivation for each m.hhai mutant is shown in table 1.
protein crystallization
oligonucleotides were purchased from midlands dna
(midlands tx) and  xxxd3157xxx  was purchased from sigma.
the self-complementary 13-mer dna 5′-tgatagcgctatc-3′ was purified on a dynamax puredna hplc
column (rainin instruments) developed in a gradient of
triethyl ammonium acetate/acetonitrile (teaa). the
dna was annealed (400 mum) in buffer (50 mm tris–hcl
(ph 7.5), 1 mm edta, 300 mm nacl), heating at 95 °c for
5 min, cooled slowly to room temperature over 2–3 h, and
then lyophilized. dna was stored as dry pellets at −20 °c.
when required, it was brought to a concentration of above
10 mg/ml in 50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5), 1 mm edta.
cocrystals for both glu119ala and glu119gln m.hhai
proteins were grown by the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion

1167

glutamate 119 in m.hhal-catalyzed dna methylation
method at 17 °c. protein/dna/cofactor mixtures 1.5 mul
(glu119ala/glu119gln m.hhai (200 mum), dna (400 mum),
and  xxxd3157xxx  (400 mum)) were mixed with 1.5 mul of crystallization solution (100 mm sodium citrate buffer (ph 5.5 or
6.0), 1.6∼2.1 m ammonium sulfate) and placed over a well
containing the crystallization solution. normally for both
glu119ala and glu119gln m.hhai, cocrystals with dimensions of 250 mum × 250 mum × 200 mum were formed within two
to five days. before x-ray data collection, the cocrystals were
transferred into a cryoprotectant, (mother liquor containing
∼30% (v/v) glycerol), followed by flash-freezing in a stream
of nitrogen gas at 100k.
x-ray data collection
the x-ray diffraction amplitudes for the glu119ala
m.hhai cocrystals were collected using a rigaku raxis
iv++ area detector (mar) mounted on a rigaku ru-300b
rotating anode generator at amgen inc. the exposure
time was 10 min every 1° rotation at 50kev, 100 ma with
a wavelength of 1.541 å at 100k. the determination of
the orientation matrix, integration, scaling and merging
of glu119ala diffraction data were done with hkl2000
software.
the glu119gln cocrystals were subjected to a rigaku
raxis ii area detector (mar) mounted on a rigaku ru-200
rotating anode generator in the chemistry and biochemistry department, university of california at santa
barbara. the exposure time was 15 min every 1.0° rotation
at 50 kev 100 ma, with a wavelength of 1.541 å. the
determination of the orientation matrix, integration,
scaling and merging of glu119gln diffraction data were
carried out with mosflm software.
structure determination
the diffraction data set for both glu119ala and
glu119gln m.hhai ternary structures were phased using
the high-resolution wt m.hhai/dna/adohcy9 (pdb
2hr1) ternary structure in space group r32, in which the
glu119 was truncated with ala or gln as the initial model.
this initial structure model was refined using cns to
determine the protein structure. 40 the refinement
included several rounds of simulated annealing refinement, using a starting temperature of 2000k, as well as
individual b-factor refinement. a random 10% of the
starting data was set aside for cross-validation (rfree
calculation). after the majority of this model was built,
water molecules were picked automatically as implemented in the cns.40 a 50 å2 b-factor cut-off for picking
water molecules was followed by manual refitting and
placement of well-ordered water molecules using the
graphics program o,41 and program cns.40 the refinement converged to a final r-factor of 21.2% with an rfree of
26.7% (50–2.70 å resolution range) and an r-factor of
21.7% with an rfree of 26.5% (50–2.75 å resolution range)
for glu119ala and glu119gln individually (table 3).
