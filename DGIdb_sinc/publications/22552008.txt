thalidomide and the immunomodulatory drug, lenalidomide, are therapeutically active in hematological malignancies.
the ubiquitously expressed e3 ligase  xxxg514xxx  ( xxxg514xxx ) has been identiﬁed as the primary teratogenic target of thalidomide.
our studies demonstrate that thalidomide, lenalidomide and another immunomodulatory drug,  xxxd2984xxx , bound
endogenous  xxxg514xxx  and recombinant  xxxg514xxx –dna damage binding protein-1 (ddb1) complexes.  xxxg514xxx  mediated antiproliferative
activities of lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  in myeloma cells, as well as lenalidomide- and  xxxd2984xxx -induced cytokine
production in t cells. lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  inhibited autoubiquitination of  xxxg514xxx  in hek293t cells expressing
thalidomide-binding competent wild-type  xxxg514xxx , but not thalidomide-binding defective crbnyw/aa. overexpression of  xxxg514xxx 
wild-type protein, but not crbnyw/aa mutant protein, in kms12 myeloma cells, ampliﬁed  xxxd2984xxx -mediated reductions in
c-myc and irf4 expression and increases in p21waf-1 expression. long-term selection for lenalidomide resistance in  xxxd2629xxx  myeloma
cell lines was accompanied by a reduction in  xxxg514xxx , while in df15r myeloma cells resistant to both  xxxd2984xxx  and
lenalidomide,  xxxg514xxx  protein was undetectable. our biophysical, biochemical and gene silencing studies show that  xxxg514xxx  is a
proximate, therapeutically important molecular target of lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx .

introduction
in multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome and lymphomas,
thalidomide and/or the structurally analogous compound lenalidomide, are antiproliferative, increase immune surveillance and decrease
stromal cell support.1–4 lenalidomide has a different spectrum of
preclinical and clinical activities from thalidomide, including increased
efﬁcacy in tumor and immune cells.5,6 the chemically related immunomodulatory drug candidate,  xxxd2984xxx , has a distinct and heightened antiproliferative potency compared with lenalidomide and
demonstrates clinical efﬁcacy in settings of lenalidomide resistance.7,8
the mechanism of action of lenalidomide has been explored in
tumor cells, myeloid cells and stromal cells.9–11 in myeloma lines,
lenalidomide has cell-type and cell-context dependent pleiotropic
effects.1–4,12–15 these include g0/g1 arrest associated with the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21waf-1, and
downregulation of the expression of interferon regulatory factor 4
(irf4) in both multiple myeloma lines and bone marrow samples from
lenalidomide-treated myeloma patients.12–14 lenalidomide decreases
the expression of anti-apoptotic and translation checkpoint proteins
 xxxg250xxx  and eif4e15 and modulates activation of rhogtpases in t cells,16
an effect critical for actin hyperpolymerization and immune synapse
formation.17 in addition, lenalidomide co-stimulates t cell proliferation
and cytokine production3 and inhibits angiogenesis and bone
marrow stromal cell growth factor production.18,19
following more than a decade of research on the mechanism of
action of thalidomide, preclinical studies identiﬁed e3 ligase protein
 xxxg514xxx  ( xxxg514xxx ) as a direct molecular target for the teratogenecity of

thalidomide.  xxxg514xxx  binds directly to thalidomide analog afﬁnity beads
and is linked to the teratogenic effects of thalidomide in zebraﬁsh and
chicks.20  xxxg514xxx  is highly conserved from plants to mammals and the
mrna for human, rat and mouse is ubiquitously expressed.21 a
truncating mutation at r419, deleting the c terminus results in a
familial syndrome of mild mental retardation.22,23  xxxg514xxx  binds to a
calcium-activated  xxxg1232xxx  in the brain, a chloride channel
in the retina,24–26 and to amp kinase, a critical sensor/transducer
protein regulating metabolic pathways in eukaryotic cells.27  xxxg514xxx  and
dna damage binding protein-1 (ddb1) form a functional e3 ligase
complex with cul4a and  xxxg1960xxx . the  xxxg514xxx  autoubiquitination activity
of this complex was inhibited by thalidomide.20
the current study, undertaken to explore the potential role of
 xxxg514xxx  as a therapeutic target, provides biophysical, biochemical
and additional functional evidence that human  xxxg514xxx  is a direct
target of lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx .
materials and methods
cell culture
cell lines nci- xxxd2629xxx  and u266 were obtained from atcc (american
type culture collection, manassas, va, usa). df15 cells were obtained
from john shaughnessy (university of arkansas, little rock, ar, usa). cells
were grown in rpmi-i640 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (gibco, grand island, ny, usa) supplemented with 2 mm
glutamine. to produce lenalidomide resistant cell lines, nci- xxxd2629xxx  cells
were treated continuously (fresh lenalidomide was added every 3–4 days)
with control (ﬁnal 0.1%  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso)) or low-dose

lenalidomide (1 mm) for 2 months until the proliferation of cells was no
longer inhibited by lenalidomide (1 mm), as determined by cell viability
(vi-cell xr cell viability analyzer, beckman coulter, indianapolis, in, usa),
cell proliferation by ﬂow cytometry and cell cycle analysis ( xxxd3027xxx 
iodide staining). after acquisition of resistance to 1 mm, the resistant  xxxd2629xxx 
cell lines were treated with lenalidomide (10 mm) for a further 4 months.
after this period of time, the cell cultures achieved fully establish resistance
up to high-dose lenalidomide (30 mm). prior to the experiments described
here,  xxxd2629xxx  lenalidomide-resistant cells were taken out of culture with
compounds for 5–7 days before use. df15 cells were made resistant to
 xxxd2984xxx  by continuous culture in the presence of increasing
concentrations of  xxxd2984xxx  (0.1–100 mm) for at least 5 months to
achieve stable  xxxd2984xxx  resistance. prior to the experiments
described here, df15r  xxxd2984xxx -resistant cells were taken out of
culture with compounds for 5–7 days before use.

fluorescence thermal melt assay to measure binding of
compounds to recombinant  xxxg514xxx 
thermal stabilities of  xxxg514xxx –ddb1 in the presence or absence of phthalimide,
thalidomide, lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  were done in the presence of
sypro orange in a microplate format according to pantoliano et al.28 two mg
of protein in 20 ml of assay buffer (25 mm tris hcl, ph 8.0, 150 mm nacl, 2 mm
sypro orange) were subjected to stepwise increase of temperature from 20
to 70 1c and the ﬂuorescence was read at every 1 1c on an abiprism 7900ht
(applied biosystems, carlsbad, ca, usa). compounds were dissolved in
dmso (1% ﬁnal in assay) and tested in quadruplicate at a concentration
range between 30 nm to 1000 mm; controls contained 1% dmso only.

thalidomide analog bead assay to measure compound
binding to endogenous  xxxg514xxx 
coupling of thalidomide analog to fg-magnetic nanoparticle beads (structure
shown in figure 1b) from tamagawa seiko co. tokyo, japan was carried
out as described20 and myeloma extract binding assays to these beads
were performed with minor modiﬁcations. u266, df15 or df15r myeloma
cell extracts or hek293t extracts were prepared in np 40 lysis buffer
(0.5% np40, 50 mm tris hcl (ph 8.0)), 150 mm nacl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol,
0.25 mm phenylmethanesulfonylﬂuoride, 1x protease inhibitor mix (roche,
indianapolis, in, usa) at approximately 2  108 cells per ml (20 mg protein/ml).
cell debris and nucleic acids were cleared by centrifugation (14 000 r.p.m.
30 min 4 1c). in competition experiments 0.5 ml (3–5 mg protein) aliquots of
the resulting extracts were preincubated (15 min room temperature) with
5 ml dmso (control) or 5 ml compound at varying concentrations in dmso.
thalidomide analog-coupled beads (0.3–0.5 mg) were added to protein
extracts and samples rotated (2 h, 4 1c). beads were washed three times
with 0.5 ml np40 buffer and then bound proteins were eluted with sodium
 xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds–page) sample
buffer. in bead elution experiments, hek293t extracts were not preincubated with compounds but ﬁnal elution was with 1 mm phthalimide,
1 mm glutarimide (ﬁnal 1% dmso) or 1% dmso in np40 lysis buffer.
samples were subjected to sds–page and immunoblot analysis performed
(as described in supplementary methods) using anti- xxxg514xxx  65–76 (1:10 000
dilution) for all studies except hek293t and kms12-pe studies in which a
mouse monoclonal anti- xxxg514xxx  1–18 was utilized; other antisera dilutions
were ddb1 (1:2000 dilution) or b-actin (1:10 000 dilution). in thalidomide
afﬁnity bead competition assays, a li-cor odessey system was used to
quantify  xxxg514xxx  band density and relative amounts of  xxxg514xxx  were
determined by averaging at least three dmso controls and expressing
 xxxg514xxx  in each competition sample as percent inhibition of  xxxg514xxx  protein
relative to the averaged controls as 100% binding. approximate ic50 values
were determined by grafit (erithacus software, surrey, uk).

cellular ubiquitination assay
hek293t cells stably expressing flag-ha-tagged (fh)- xxxg514xxx  or fh-crbnyw/aa
were treated for 3 h before harvest with the proteasome inhibitor mg132
(10 mm) or left untreated. lysates were prepared as described20 and incubated
& 2012 macmillan publishers limited

with anti-flag (m2, sigma, st louis, mo, usa) agarose beads. fh- xxxg514xxx  was
eluted with sds–page buffer and sds–page separated proteins immunoblotted with anti-ha antibody (3f10, roche). unless otherwise indicated,
compounds were added to cells 3 h before addition of mg132.

short hairpin rna of  xxxg514xxx  knockdown studies
see online supplemental methods section.

t cell isolation and activity assays
t cells were isolated from human leukocytes (blood center of new jersey,
east orange, nj, usa) by centrifugation through  xxxd3253xxx  following the
‘rosettesep’ protocol (stem cell technologies, vancouver, bc, canada).
puriﬁed t cells were treated with 1 mg/ml pha-l at 371c for 24 h and then
subjected to small interfering rna (sirna) transfection (300 nm sirna of
 xxxg514xxx  (sicrbn-1)/100 ml/ 2  106 cells/cuvette) using amaxa human t-cell
nucleofector kit (lonza, basel, switzerland) with t-20 program. control low
gc content negative sirna was also transfected. transfected cells were
cultured in rpmi containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 1c for 24 h.
cells (1  106) were collected for measuring knockdown efﬁciency by
quantitative reverse transcription-pcr. the remaining transfected cells
were seeded on prebound  xxxd2676xxx  (3 mg/ml) 96-well tc plates at 1.25 
106 cells/200 ml per well and treated with dmso or compounds in duplicate
at 37 1c for 48 h. after 48 h the supernatants of drug-treated cells were
collected and interleukin-2 or  xxxg2296xxx -a production measured
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (thermo scientiﬁc, rockford, il, usa)
according to the manufacturer’s directions. the sicrbn 1-transfected t cells
were harvested at 72 h post transfection and  xxxg514xxx  protein reduction was
determined by immunoblot analysis using the  xxxg514xxx  65–76 antisera.
low gc sirna-transfected cells were used as a negative control.

statistical analyses
analyses for the multiple group comparisons were performed with 1-way
analysis of variance followed dunnett’s posttest. po0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.

results
thalidomide, lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  bind to
 xxxg514xxx  in vitro
recombinant human zz-tagged  xxxg514xxx  and full length ddb1
expression plasmids were co-expressed in sf9 cells. a complex
containing both  xxxg514xxx  and ddb1 was puriﬁed from these cells
(supplementary figure s1) and ﬂuorescent thermal melt shift
studies were performed on the puriﬁed complex in the presence
of thalidomide, lenalidomide, the functionally related compound
 xxxd2984xxx  or phthalimide (a fragment of thalidomide
not containing glutarimide) (figures 1a and b). the puriﬁed
zz- xxxg514xxx -ddb1 complex had greater stability and solubility than
 xxxg514xxx  alone. dose-dependent interaction with the  xxxg514xxx -ddb1
complex was observed with thalidomide, lenalidomide and
 xxxd2984xxx , with ic50 values of b30 mm, b3 mm and b3 mm,
respectively (figure 1a), while phthalimide (inactive in immunomodulatory and antiproliferative assays) showed no appreciable
thermal melt shift with the  xxxg514xxx –ddb1 complex.
to study lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  binding to  xxxg514xxx  in
extracts from myeloma cells, we used thalidomide analog-coupled
afﬁnity beads prepared as previously described.20 preincubation of
u266 myeloma cell extracts with either lenalidomide (100 mm) or
 xxxd2984xxx  (100 mm) (figure 1c) prevented  xxxg514xxx  and ddb1
binding to the thalidomide analog-coupled beads, as determined
by immunoblot analysis of proteins selectively bound to the beads
( xxxg514xxx  antibody validation in supplementary figure s2). the u266
extract input appeared to express more ddb1 than  xxxg514xxx ,
but  xxxg514xxx  protein was concentrated on the beads as observed
in control (dmso preincubation) eluates. to complement these
competitive binding studies hek293t  xxxg514xxx  prebound to the
afﬁnity beads was eluted with compounds thalidomide and
glutarimide but not phthalimide (figures 1b and d). preincubation

potency, and both showed greater potency than thalidomide
(figure 1e). thalidomide analog bead binding to endogenous
 xxxg514xxx  in u266 myeloma extracts was dose-dependently inhibited
by preincubation with either lenalidomide or  xxxd2984xxx  with
ic50 values of b2 mm (figures 1f and g). thus in two different cell lines,
 xxxg514xxx  binding to thalidomide analog afﬁnity beads were competitively
inhibited by lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx . notably glutarimide,
but not phthalimide eluted  xxxg514xxx  from afﬁnity beads.

the parental u266 line. these reduced  xxxg514xxx  expression cells
(u266-crbn60 and u266-crbn75) were less responsive than the
parental cells to antiproliferative effects lenalidomide across a
dose–response range of 0.01 to 10 mm, and the reduction
in response related directly to the level of reduction of  xxxg514xxx 
(figure 2a). the u266 cell lines with stably reduced  xxxg514xxx 
expression (u266-crbn60 and u266-crbn75) retained greater
sensitivity to inhibition of proliferation by  xxxd2984xxx  but
required higher concentrations for inhibition than the parental
cells (figure 2b). expression of the tumor suppressor p21waf-1 was
increased in the parental u266 cells approximately threefold, by
incubation with lenalidomide or  xxxd2984xxx  for 48 h, but these
increases were attenuated approximately 35% in u266-crbn75

binding incompetent  xxxg514xxx  abrogates thalidomide, lenalidomide
and  xxxd2984xxx  effects on autoubiquitination and prevents
 xxxd2984xxx  effects on protein abundance
as thalidomide was previously shown to inhibit autoubiquitination
of  xxxg514xxx ,20 we evaluated the ability of lenalidomide and
 xxxd2984xxx  to inhibit  xxxg514xxx  autoubiquitination in hek293t
cells transfected with either fh- xxxg514xxx , or a mutant fh-crbnyw/aa
incompetent in its ability to bind thalidomide.20 hek293t cells
stably expressing wild-type fh- xxxg514xxx  or fh-crbnyw/aa were
preincubated with compounds before the addition of the
proteasome inhibitor mg132 to facilitate accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins20 (figures 3a and b). while thalidomide,
lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  were all effective dosedependent inhibitors of wild-type fh- xxxg514xxx  autoubiquitination
(figure 3a), they were unable to inhibit autoubiquitination of the
binding defective mutant (figure 3b).

adds ubiquitin either to  xxxg514xxx  itself (autoubiquitination) or to a
substrate protein (s) that binds  xxxg514xxx . the inhibition of
autoubiquitination of  xxxg514xxx  by thalidomide, lenalidomide or
 xxxd2984xxx  is indicated by an x. other substrates ubiquitinated
by the  xxxg514xxx  e3 ligase are not yet reported. it has not been
clariﬁed if these compounds’ effects are antagonistic or agonistic
to the e3 ligase ubiquitination of putative additional substrates.
we also investigated effects of expression of the wild-type
fh- xxxg514xxx  versus the binding incompetent fh-crbnyw/aa mutant
in kms12 myeloma cells. the expression levels of wild-type
fh- xxxg514xxx  and fh-crbnyw/aa were determined to be approximately twofold and fourfold higher than endogenous  xxxg514xxx ,
respectively (figure 3d). treatment ofwild-type fh- xxxg514xxx  kms12
cells with  xxxd2984xxx  resulted in measurable decreases in
c-myc and irf4 namely, 57 and 45% (signal change by 100 nm
 xxxd2984xxx  relative to non-treated parental non-transfected
kms12 corrected for actin) (figure 3e) and an increase in p21waf-1

autoubiquitination of  xxxg514xxx . hek293t cells stably expressing flag-ha  xxxg514xxx  (fh)- xxxg514xxx  were established by lentiviral transduction. cells
were treated with the indicated concentrations of compounds for 3 h before harvest. fh- xxxg514xxx  was immunoprecipitated (ip) with anti-flag

or fh-crbnyw/aa were treated and processed as in figure 3a. (c) cartoon of  xxxg514xxx  e3 ligase complex.  xxxg514xxx  is bound to the adapter protein
ddb1 that binds to cul4a a scaffold protein for  xxxg1960xxx  and the e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. e2 adds ubiquitin protein either to  xxxg514xxx  itself
(autoubiquitination) or to a putative substrate protein (s) that binds  xxxg514xxx . x marks the inhibition of autoubiquitination of  xxxg514xxx  by
thalidomide, lenalidomide or  xxxd2984xxx . (d) kms12 cells constitutively expressing fh- xxxg514xxx  or fh-crbnyw/aa were established by
lentiviral transduction and expression of  xxxg514xxx  determined in whole-cell extracts by immunoblot analysis with mouse anti- xxxg514xxx . (e) control
kms12 cells (  ) or cells stably expressing wild-type fh- xxxg514xxx  or fh-crbnyw/aa were treated with the indicated concentrations of
 xxxd2984xxx  and incubated for 48 h before extract preparation, sds–page and immunoblotting for c-myc or irf4. (f ) control kms12 cells or

 xxxg514xxx  expression level modulates t-cell response to lenalidomide
and  xxxd2984xxx 
the stimulation of interleukin-2 production in activated t cells
was much greater with the s- compared with the r-enantiomer of
methyl- xxxd2984xxx  (figure 4a), with ic50 values of 0.02 and
410 mm, respectively (figure 4b). competition of these methylpomalidomide enantiomers for  xxxg514xxx  binding to the thalidomide
analog afﬁnity beads correlated with the rank order of functional
difference; ic50 values were b10 mm for the active s enantiomer
and 4300 mm for the inactive r enantiomer (figure 4c).
to complement the ﬁndings in multiple myeloma lines, we
investigated the impact of reducing  xxxg514xxx  in activated human
t cells by sicrbn treatment and conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant decrease
in  xxxg514xxx  protein by immunoblot analysis (figure 4d). effects
of lenalidomide or  xxxd2984xxx  to induce t-cell production
of interleukin-2 (5–23-fold) (figure 4e) and  xxxg2296xxx -a
(a 5–10-fold) (figure 4f) were signiﬁcantly reduced by sicrbn.
acquired resistance to lenalidomide is accompanied by
decreased  xxxg514xxx 
 xxxd2629xxx  myeloma cells were treated in cell culture with increasing
concentrations of lenalidomide (l) or control vehicle dmso (d) for
extended durations to select for resistance to the antiproliferative
effects of lenalidomide.  xxxg514xxx  mrna expression was observed
to decrease in cultures exposed continuously (6 months) to
lenalidomide 1 mm, and also in cultures sequentially treated with
1 mm (2 months) followed by 10 mm lenalidomide for 4 months
(figure 5a; data for  xxxd2629xxx  r10-4 cells).  xxxg514xxx  protein was shown to
leukemia (2012) 2326 – 2335

be decreased in our independently generated lenalidomideresistant  xxxd2629xxx  cell lines compared with the parental  xxxd2629xxx  cell
line (figure 5b). all these lenalidomide-resistant  xxxd2629xxx  cell lines
had a 50%  xxxg514xxx  gene copy reduction (data not shown). these
 xxxg514xxx -reduced cell lines showed marked resistance to the
antiproliferative effects of lenalidomide (figure 5c), yet remained
sensitive to inhibition of proliferation by  xxxd2984xxx , although
higher concentrations of compound are required than for parental
 xxxd2629xxx  cells (figure 5d).
acquired resistance to  xxxd2984xxx  is accompanied by major
decrease of  xxxg514xxx  protein
df15 myeloma cells sensitive to proliferation inhibition by
lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  (figure 6a), expressed  xxxg514xxx 
protein (figure 6a, insert). df15r cells made resistant to
antiproliferative effects of  xxxd2984xxx  and lenalidomide by
continuous culture in increasing concentration of  xxxd2984xxx 
(up to100 mm) had minimal detectable  xxxg514xxx  protein (figure 6a,
insert).  xxxg514xxx  was shown to be distributed predominantly in
the cytoplasm of df15 cells (figure 6b). consistent with the
immunoblot data, df15 cells showed  xxxg514xxx  immunoﬂuorescence
in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, while minimal  xxxg514xxx 
immunoﬂuorescence was observed in df15r cells (figure 6b).
preincubation of df15 myeloma cell extracts with excess
lenalidomide (100 mm) prevented  xxxg514xxx  and ddb1 binding to
thalidomide analog afﬁnity beads (figure 6c). protein extracts
from df15r cells had abundant ddb1 but undetectable  xxxg514xxx  (in)
(figure 6c). despite the potential for  xxxg514xxx  to be concentrated by
thalidomide analog bead binding, as observed in df15 extracts
(figure 6c; df15, dmso lane), no  xxxg514xxx  was observed in bead
eluates from df15r extracts preincubated with dmso. although

that binding is dependent on  xxxg514xxx  (figure 6c).20 we investigated
the possibility that  xxxg514xxx  was mutated or  xxxg514xxx  gene copy number
was decreased in df15r cells. there was no evidence of mutation
or change in copy number of the  xxxg514xxx  gene in df15r cells

discussion
the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide has pleiotropic
activities in distinct cell types and temporal contexts, which result
in direct antitumor effects on cancer cells, inhibition of stromal
growth factor support and enhancement of host anticancer
immunity.5–7 this broad range of activities has historically
challenged the concept of a single target for these compounds,
raising possibilities for either promiscuous interactions with a
number of targets, or, as supported by the ﬁndings presented
here, direct interaction with a speciﬁc target that has a central
role in orchestrating a range of subsequent cellular events. the
observation that  xxxg514xxx , which is part of an e3 ligase complex with
ddb1, is the target for thalidomide-based teratogenicity led us to

formally evaluate the role of  xxxg514xxx  as a target for the known
clinical activities of lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx .
using complementary and independent biophysical methods,
we show that in addition to thalidomide, both lenalidomide and
 xxxd2984xxx  bind human  xxxg514xxx  and that these compounds also
inhibit the autoubiquitination of  xxxg514xxx . the binding and expression of  xxxg514xxx  in myeloma cell lines were shown to be functionally
linked to well-known clinically relevant cellular activities of these
compounds. all observations are consistent with direct interaction
between these immunomodulatory compounds and  xxxg514xxx  within
the ddb1-containing e3 ligase complex. notably, elution studies
using thalidomide analog beads demonstrated that  xxxg514xxx  binds to
the glutarimide moiety of these compounds, but not to the
phthalimide moiety. additionally, inhibition of  xxxg514xxx  autoubiquitination by thalidomide, lenalidomide or  xxxd2984xxx  was
abrogated in a binding defective mutant  xxxg514xxx  (fh-crbnyw/aa).
the functional consequences of the binding of the immunomodulatory compounds to  xxxg514xxx  were investigated in u266 cells
in which  xxxg514xxx  had been reduced either 60 or 75% by lentivial
transduction.  xxxg514xxx  reduction decreased the antiproliferative
potency of both lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  and signiﬁcantly

independent lenalidomide resistant cells lines,  xxxd2629xxx  r10-1, r10-2, r10-3 and r10-4 ).  xxxd2629xxx  cells were treated with control (final 0.1% dmso)
(d) or lenalidomide (1 mm) (l1) for 2 months until the proliferation of cells was no longer inhibited by 1 mm lenalidomide. the lenalidomide
treated cultures were subsequently treated with 10 mm lenalidomide for a further 4 months to fully establish resistance to high-dose
lenalidomide (30 mm). arbitary units for  xxxg514xxx  mrna are shown. (b) immunoblot of  xxxg514xxx  in  xxxd2629xxx  cells treated with dmso for 6 months

prevented compound-mediated induction of the cell cycle
progression inhibitor p21waf-1 and the suppression of irf4, a
gene critical for myeloma cell growth. a similar effect
on  xxxd2984xxx -induced protein changes was seen in
ksm12 myeloma cells, by the presence of the  xxxg514xxx  mutant
(fh-crbnyw/aa).
to determine the role of  xxxg514xxx  in acquired resistance to
lenalidomide,  xxxd2629xxx  resistant cell lines were selected by prolonged
exposure to increasing doses of lenalidomide. the ﬁnal concentration of 10 mm lenalidomide was higher than maximum clinically
achievable plasma concentrations of lenalidomide.29  xxxg514xxx  mrna
expression decreased concurrently with increased antiproliferative
resistance to lenalidomide;  xxxd2984xxx  maintained efﬁcacy,
albeit at higher concentrations, in these lenalidomide-resistant
cells. the observation of decreased  xxxg514xxx  expression correlating
with acquisition of lenalidomide resistance in cells was consistent
with published data30 showing a reduction in  xxxg514xxx  mrna
(20–90%) in eight out of nine multiple myeloma patients with
clinically-acquired lenalidomide resistance.
differential potency and resistance of myeloma cells lines to
lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  led us to address whether  xxxg514xxx 
binding afﬁnity of these compounds could explain their different
spectra of activity.  xxxd2984xxx  shows approximately 10-fold
leukemia (2012) 2326 – 2335

higher potency than lenalidomide in a number of cellular systems,
activity in lenalidomide-resistant preclinical models31 and also
myeloma patients refractory and resistant to lenalidomide show
clinical responses to  xxxd2984xxx .7–9 in addition, our results
show that reduction of  xxxg514xxx  expression was associated with a
greater loss of the antiproliferative potency of lenalidomide
than that of  xxxd2984xxx . apparent  xxxg514xxx -binding afﬁnities of
lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  were similar in myeloma cell
lysates and in ﬂuorescent thermal melt assays performed with the
recombinant  xxxg514xxx –ddb1 complexes. in these studies, the cellular
context, such as organelle localization (nuclear versus cytoplasmic)
or peripheral membrane association, is lost. such context may
alter apparent potency of these compounds against the  xxxg514xxx 
complex. in the afﬁnity binding experiments, we coupled the
beads through the phthalimide portion and this might affect the
interaction of lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx  with the  xxxg514xxx 
complex. indeed, the fact that the potency of lenalidomide is
more shifted than that of  xxxd2984xxx  in  xxxg514xxx -reduced cells
suggests that there may be other proteins that modulate the
effects of  xxxd2984xxx . the clinical potency of these compounds
reﬂects their cellular potencies where  xxxd2984xxx  is more
potent than lenalidomide, which in turn is more potent than
thalidomide. in vivo other aspects including metabolism,

production and  xxxg514xxx  binding to thalidomide analog afﬁnity
beads showed strong enantiomeric selectivity for s-methylpomalidomide over the r isomer. this is consistent with the
thesis that binding of immunomodulatory compounds to  xxxg514xxx  is
a proximal event in subsequent functional outcomes.
there are some species differences in teratogenicity between
thalidomide, lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx . thalidomide does
not cause limb malformations in rodents but does in rabbits.32

2334
there are reports of other types of developmental defects, for
example, vertebral column, rib and eye malformations, when
thalidomide was given to pregnant rats.33 lenalidomide did not
have teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but produced limb
malformations in fetuses of cynomolgus monkeys (lenalidomide
food and drug administration product label and celgene
unpublished data).  xxxd2984xxx  was teratogenic to both rats
and rabbits, with limb malformations observed in rabbits and
visceral defects in rats (celgene, unpublished data). there is very
strong conservation of the  xxxg514xxx  sequence between these species
and both mouse and human  xxxg514xxx  bind selectively to thalidomide
analog afﬁnity beads and binding is competed by thalidomide,20
lenalidomide or  xxxd2984xxx . it is possible that there may
be differences between rodents, rabbits and primates in the
importance of  xxxg514xxx  and/or protein substrates modiﬁed by  xxxg514xxx 
activity during embryonic development.
our characterization of  xxxg514xxx  as the target of lenalidomide and
 xxxd2984xxx , in addition to thalidomide, leaves a number of
important questions unanswered. these include the cellular
importance of compound-modulation of  xxxg514xxx  autoubiquitination,
compound effects on ubiquitination of physiological substrates of
the  xxxg514xxx - e3 ligase, and how these compounds may modify the
abundance, localization and activity of  xxxg514xxx  e3 ligase substrate
proteins. in addition, we need to understand what other factors
inﬂuence the cellular and functional differentiation of the
antitumor effects of thalidomide, lenalidomide and  xxxd2984xxx . our data linking  xxxg514xxx  expression to response and
resistance to immunomodulatory compounds in myeloma
cells provide a ﬁrm basis for future studies to deﬁne the role of
the  xxxg514xxx  e3 ligase complex and downstream substrates in
the pleiotropic effects of these compounds. further dissection of
the mechanism of action of immunomodulatory compounds at
the molecular level, may not only result in discovery of novel
antitumor protein targets within the  xxxg514xxx  pathway, but also pave
the way for new approaches to other e3 ubiquitin ligase systems
as therapeutic targets.
