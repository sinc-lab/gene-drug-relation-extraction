abstract
the hyperalgesic response to  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) is thought to be mediated by activation of the camp/ xxxg1836xxx  pathway in
primary sensory neurones. the aim of this study was to investigate the relative contribution of different pge2 (ep) receptor subtypes to the overall
activity of adenylyl cyclase in adult rat isolated dorsal root ganglion (drg) cells, in vitro. pge2 and the prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptor agonist onoae1-329 increased [3h]camp production with ec50 values of 500nm and 70 nm, respectively, and showed similar efficacies. no combination of
prostanoid ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3 or  xxxg1875xxx  receptor selective agonists produced synergistic increases in [3h]camp. the prostacyclin mimetic cicaprost
increased [3h]camp production with an ec50 value of 42 nm and produced a significantly greater maximal response compared with pge2. no
evidence for prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx -dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity could be obtained to account for the relatively weak effect
of pge2 compared with  xxxg1879xxx  agonists. interestingly, sulprostone (prostanoid ep3/ xxxg1872xxx  agonist) caused a rho-kinasedependent retraction of neurites, suggesting an alternative role for prostanoid ep3 receptors in drg cells. in conclusion, pge2 mediated increases
in adenylyl cyclase activity in primary sensory neurones is likely to be mediated by activation of prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptors, and is not under
inhibitory control by prostanoid ep3 receptors.

1. introduction
 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) and prostacyclin (pgi2) and are well
established hyperalgesic agents (bley et al., 1998; samad et al.,
2002; svensson and yaksh, 2002), thought to mediate their
hyperalgesic actions through specific g protein-coupled receptors linked to gs proteins and activation of adenylyl cyclase
(ferreira and nakamura, 1979; hingtgen et al., 1995; cui and
nicol, 1995; lopshire and nicol, 1998). pge2 stimulates four
subtypes of prostanoid ep receptors: ep1 which couples to
intracellular ca2+ mobilization,  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  which couple to gs,
and ep3 which couples primarily to gi/o proteins (narumiya et
al., 1999). in addition, the prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx  undergoes
post-translational rna splicing to produce multiple prostanoid
ep3 isoforms (namba et al., 1993) which have equal affinity for

pge2 and other prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx  agonists, but each of
which may additionally couple to gs, gq/11, or g12/13 proteins
(breyer et al., 2001). prostaglandins facilitate nociception at
different levels of integration (samad et al., 2002) with recent
studies suggesting that prostanoid ep1,  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors,
but not ep3 receptors, are essential for spinal pain sensitization
(bär et al., 2004; reinold et al., 2005), and that prostanoid ep3
receptors may indeed attenuate nociception under inflammatory
conditions (bär et al., 2004; takasaki et al., 2005).
prostanoid ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3c,  xxxg1875xxx  and prostacyclin (ip)
receptors, but not the prostanoid ep3a or ep3b receptor
subtypes, have been identified in isolated rat dorsal root
ganglion (drg) cells (southall and vasko, 2001). because the
affinity of pge2 is higher for the rat prostanoid ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx 
receptor subtypes compared with the prostanoid ep1 and  xxxg1873xxx 
receptor subtypes (boie et al., 1997), one might expect that the
pge2-mediated hyperalgesic activity mediated through either
prostanoid  xxxg1873xxx  or  xxxg1875xxx  receptors would be attenuated by the
simultaneous activation of prostanoid ep3 receptors coupled to

gi/o proteins. however, pre-exposing these primary sensory
neurones to antisense oligonucleotides for prostanoid ep
receptor subtypes demonstrated that pge2-induced sensitization of sensory neurones was dependent on prostanoid ep3c and
 xxxg1875xxx  receptors (southall and vasko, 2001). thus, although the
prostanoid ep3c receptor can couple to both gi/o and gs (namba
et al., 1993; irie et al., 1993), the activation of adenylyl cyclase
may dominate with prostanoid ep3c and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors working
either independently or co-operatively to increase camp levels
(southall and vasko, 2001).
with the current availability of potent and selective
prostanoid ep receptor agonists, ono-di-004 [(17s)-2,5ethano-6-oxo-17,20-dimethyl pge 1 ], ono-ae1-259-01
[(16s-deoxy-9beta-chloro-15-deoxy-16-hydroxy-17,17-trimethylene-19,20-didehydro-pgf2), ono-ae-248 [11,15-o-dimethyl-pge2], and  xxxd873xxx  [16-(3-methoxymethyl)phenylomega-tetranor-3,7-dithia- xxxd124xxx ] (suzawa et al., 2000), we have
further investigated the hypothesis that prostanoid ep3c and
 xxxg1875xxx  receptors may be responsible for pge2-induced campdependent sensitization of sensory neurones. our studies
suggest that pge2 acts via prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptors to increase
adenylyl cyclase activity in rat drg cells, but we find no
evidence that prostanoid ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors work cooperatively. furthermore, our data shows that activation of
prostanoid ep3 receptors cannot account for the decreased
efficacy of pge2 compared to the  xxxg1879xxx 
agonists cicaprost and pgi2 for stimulation of adenylyl cyclase
in rat drg cells. a preliminary account of the effect of
sulprostone on neurite extension has been published (wise,
2003).
2. methods
2.1. preparation of primary culture of adult rat drg neurones
the dorsal root ganglia were removed from all levels of
the spinal cord of male sprague-dawley rats (150–200g) and
cultures were prepared as described previously (rowlands et
al., 2001). all experiments were performed under licence
from the government of the hong kong sar and endorsed
by the animal experimentation ethics committee of the
chinese university of hong kong. briefly, rats were
anaesthetized and dorsal root ganglia were dissected into
ham's f14 medium (ham's nutrient mixture f14 medium
containing ultroser g (usg, 4%), penicillin (100 u/ml) and
streptomycin (100 mug/ml)), followed by incubation with collagenase (0.125%), then trypsin (0.25%) in serum-free ham's f14
medium. the dorsal root ganglia were resuspended in dnase i
(90 mug/ml) and soybean  xxxd207xxx  (100 mug/ml) and
dispersed by trituration. the cell suspension was centrifuged
through a cushion of bovine  xxxg124xxx  (15%) to eliminate
much of the cellular debris. the cell pellet was resuspended in
ham's f14 medium containing  xxxd1790xxx  (10 mum) to inhibit
non-neuronal cell proliferation. cells were plated onto tissue
culture plates or 25 mm glass coverslips precoated with poly-dlornithine (500 mug/ml) and laminin (5 mug/ml) and, unless
otherwise stated, were maintained in culture for 5days in an

atmosphere of 5% co2 at 37°c. medium was replaced after
3days in culture, and  xxxd1790xxx  was removed prior to assays.
unless otherwise stated,  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf) was
included in the culture medium. collagenase b and trypsin
were purchased from roche diagnostics (usa), ham's nutrient
mixture f14 from imperial laboratories (uk), and ngf (mouse
2.5s) from alomone laboratories (israel). pgi2 and sulprostone
were from cayman chemical (usa) and pge2 was supplied by
sigma chemical co. (usa). all other compounds were supplied
by gibco (usa) or sigma chemical co. (usa).
2.2. transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with
prostanoid ep receptor subtypes
human embryonic kidney 293 (hek 293) cells were
purchased from atcc and were maintained in dulbecco's
modified eagle's medium (dmem) containing penicillin
(100 u/ml), streptomycin (100 mug/ml) and foetal bovine
serum (10%), and were incubated in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% co2/95% air at 37 °c. hek 293 cells were transfected
at 80% confluency in 12-well plates and maintained in 1 ml
dmem medium. hek 293 cells were transfected with
0.5mug/ml human  xxxg1873xxx  (guthrie cdna resource
centre, usa) using lipofectamine 2000 liposome reagent
and opti-mem i reduced serum medium for 5h, according to
the manufacturer's instructions, and all cells were assayed
48h post-transfection.
2.3. measurement of [3h]camp production
adenylyl cyclase activity was assayed as described
previously (rowlands et al., 2001), except that indomethacin
was excluded to better mimic the in vivo situation. drg cells
(typically 5000cells/well of 24-well plates) were cultured in
ham's f14 medium containing  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf,
50ng/ml), and were incubated overnight with [3h]adenine (8 xxxd79xxx ; specific activity of 888 gbq/mmol; amersham
biosciences, hong kong) and washed twice with 1 ml
hepes-buffered saline (hbs: 25 mm hepes, ph 7.4,
135mm nacl, 3.5 mm kcl, 2.5mm cacl2, 1.0 mm mgcl2,
3.3 mm glucose). drg cells were incubated with test
compounds for 30 min at 37 °c in assay buffer (hbs
containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine ( xxxd2388xxx ) to
inhibit  xxxg1696xxx  activity). the
reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic
acid and atp, and [3h]camp was separated from [3h]atp by
column chromatography, and counted in a liquid scintillation
counter using optiphase ‘hisafe’ 3 scintillant (pharmacia
biotech far east ltd). the production of [3h]camp from
cellular [3h]atp was estimated as the ratio of radiolabelled
camp to total axp (i.e. camp, adp and atp), and is
expressed as [camp] / [total axp] × 100 (i.e. % conversion).
all assays were performed in duplicate. solvent controls were
run as appropriate, but neither dimethylsulfoxide nor ethanol
interfered with the assay at the concentrations used. ono-di004, ono-ae1-259-01, ono-ae-248 and  xxxd873xxx

ltd, osaka, japan. cicaprost was a gift from schering ag,
berlin, germany.
2.4. neurite extension assay
drg cells were plated onto 25 mm glass coverslips in 6well plates and incubated in ham's f14 medium containing
 xxxd1790xxx , but no ngf. after 24h in culture, drg cells
were washed to remove dead cells and fresh medium added
without  xxxd1790xxx . the proportion of drg cells with
neurites was determined by counting a minimum of 100cells/
well, and cells with processes at least the diameter of the cell
body in length were counted as neurite bearing. the assay
was performed 40 h after drg cell isolation, with the rhokinase inhibitor  xxxd3541xxx  added 15 min before pge2 or
sulprostone.
2.5. statistical analysis
values for ec50 and emax, the maximum effect, were obtained
by fitting the log concentration-response curves to the standard
four–parameter logistic equation using graphpad prism software version 4.0 (graphpad software inc., san diego, usa).
intrinsic activity was calculated as the maximal change in
agonist-stimulated [3h]camp production relative to that of
cicaprost assessed in the same batch of cells. values reported are
means ± s.e.m., unless otherwise stated. comparisons between
groups were made using student's t-test, or anova (analysis of
variance) with bonferroni's or dunnett's post-tests, as appropriate. statistical significance was taken as p < 0.05.

3. results
3.1. identification of prostanoid receptors mediating increases
in [3h]camp production in drg cells
cicaprost and pge2 produced a log concentration-dependent
increase in [3h]camp production (fig. 1a) with ec50 values of
42 ± 12 nm and 500 ± 232 nm, respectively (n = 3). prostaglandin
d2 and sulprostone (prostanoid ep3/ xxxg1872xxx  agonist) had
no effect on adenylyl cyclase activity in rat drg cells. as
observed previously (smith et al., 1998; rowlands et al., 2001),
the maximal effect of pge2 was significantly less than that of
cicaprost (intrinsic activity value of 0.45, p < 0.001).
to compare the response to  xxxg1879xxx  agonists
compared to pge2 under physiological conditions, drg cells
were incubated with 1 mum cicaprost, pge2 or pgi2 in the
absence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. because of the short
half-life of pgi2 (moncada et al., 1976), the incubation period
was decreased to 1min. both cicaprost and pgi2 appeared to
increase [3h]camp production, but only cicaprost produced a
statistically significant effect (p < 0.05; fig. 1b). in contrast,
pge2 was ineffective under these conditions (fig. 1b).
to determine the prostanoid ep receptor subtype responsible
for pge2-stimulated [3h]camp production, drg cells were
incubated with prostanoid ep receptor selective agonists: onodi-004 (ep1), ono-ae1-259-01 ( xxxg1873xxx ), ono-ae-248 (ep3)
or  xxxd873xxx  ( xxxg1875xxx ). only the prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptor
agonist  xxxd873xxx  produced a log concentration-dependent increase in [3h]camp production (fig. 1c) with an ec50
value of 70 ± 14 (n = 3). the intrinsic activity value of ono-

effect of simultaneous addition of prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx 
agonists on basal adenylyl cyclase activity and activity in
response to an ec50 concentration of cicaprost was examined.
neither sulprostone (10–100 nm) nor ono-ae-248 (1 nm–
10mum) had any significant effect on either basal or cicaproststimulated [3h]camp production (fig. 1d).

a mixture of all 4 prostanoid ep receptor agonists (ep1–4, each at 100nm). data

ae1-329 was 0.48 compared with cicaprost (p < 0.001), and
was not significantly different from that of pge2. the
prostanoid  xxxg1873xxx  agonist ono-ae1-259-01 failed to
increase [3h]camp production in rat drg cells (fig. 1c) in
contrast, in hek 293 cells transiently expressing prostanoid
hep2 receptors, basal [3h]camp production increased from
0.25 ± 0.12% conversion to 1.92 ± 0.15% conversion in the
presence of 1 mum ono-ae1-259-01 (p < 0.01; n = 3). for
comparison, the prostanoid  xxxg1873xxx  agonist butaprost
(1mum) increased adenylyl cyclase activity to 1.46 ± 0.12%
conversion (p < 0.01; n = 3).

in light of recent studies suggesting a co-operative role for
prostanoid ep receptor subtypes in rat drg cells (southall and
vasko, 2001), the prostanoid ep receptor agonists were tested in
dual combinations at 100nm to maintain selectivity for receptor
subtypes. at 100 nm, only  xxxd873xxx , cicaprost, and the
combination of all 4 prostanoid ep receptor selective agonists
significantly increased [3h]camp production (fig. 2); the
response to the combination of all 4 prostanoid ep receptor
selective agonists was not significantly different from the
response to  xxxd873xxx  alone. when drg cells were
incubated with combinations of ono-di-004, ono-ae1-25901, ono-ae-248 or cicaprost, there was no statistically
significant inhibition nor synergism of adenylyl cylcase activity
(fig. 3a,b,c). when drg cells were incubated with prostanoid
ep and  xxxg1879xxx  agonists in the presence of  xxxd873xxx ,
the apparent increase in adenylyl cyclase activity was no greater
than expected from the prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptor agonist alone
(fig. 3d).

 xxxd3541xxx  (y, 1mum) were added 15min before ham's f14 solution (control),

neurites was determined over the following 8h. data represent mean ± s.e.m. of
10 wells from at least 3 independent experiments. the proportion of drg cells
with neurites at time 0 was 61 ± 3%. ⁎p < 0.05 compared with control group.

g12/13 resulting in rho-kinase-dependent retraction of neurites
in rat pheochromocytoma (pc12) cells (katoh et al., 1996).
immunoreactive galpha13 and the rho-specific guanine nucleotide
exchange factor pdz-rhogef are enriched in nociceptive
neurons within dorsal root ganglia, and intense staining can be
found in lamina i and ii in the spinal cord; a region where

73

nociceptive afferents terminate (kuner et al., 2002). therefore,
the effect of sulprostone on neurite extension was examined in
rat drg cells. the selective prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx  agonist
sulprostone was chosen because this study preceded the
availability of the more specific prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx 
agonists such as ono-ae-248.
the adenylyl cyclase assays described so far were performed
after the drg cells have been in culture for 5 days with ngf,
but at this time the density of neurites was too intense to study
individual cells. therefore, the proportion of drg cells
expressing neurites was first studied after 16 h and 40h in
culture in the absence and presence of ngf (50 ng/ml) since
adult drg cells do not require exogenous neurotrophins for
their continued survival in vitro (lindsay, 1988). at 16 h, the
proportion of drg cells expressing neurites was 6 ± 2% and
33 ± 4% (p < 0.001), in the absence and presence of ngf,
respectively (n = 9 wells). at 40 h, the proportion of drg cells
expressing neurites was increased to 66 ± 3% and 86 ± 2%
(p < 0.001), in the absence and presence of ngf, respectively
(n = 9 wells). the effect of sulprostone was therefore investigated in drg cells maintained in culture for 40 h in the absence
of ngf.
over the 9 h assay period, there was a slight, but statistically
insignificant, increase in the proportion of drg cells expressing
neurites (from 61 ± 3% at time 0 to 68 ± 3% after 9 h) which was
not altered by the  xxxd1306xxx   xxxd3541xxx  [(r)-(+)-transn-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide] at
1mum (from 61 ± 5% at time 0 to 69 ± 5% after 9 h; fig. 4).
addition of 1mum sulprostone caused neurites to retract over the
first 2h. the proportion of drg cells bearing neurites was
decreased by 22% (p < 0.05), and this effect was inhibited by
 xxxd3541xxx  (fig. 4a). by the 5 h time point, the proportion of drg
cells expressing neurites had returned to control levels. in

and cells were incubated for 30min at 37°c. data represent mean ± s.e.m. of 3 experiments, each performed in duplicate.

contrast, pge2 at 1 mum had no statistically significant effect on
neurite extension (fig. 4b).
given that drg cells were responsive to sulprostone after
40 h in culture, but no inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity
had been detected in cells maintained in culture for 112h (fig.
1d), a more complete profile of sulprostone was determined
over time. drg cells were incubated in the absence or
presence of ngf (50 ng/ml) and sulprostone-mediated inhibition of cicaprost-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was
examined in cells after 16 h, 40 h, and 112 h in culture. in
competition binding assays with [3h]pge2, sulprostone has a
ki value of 0.7nm for the rat prostanoid ep3alpha receptor isoform
and shows a 134-fold selectivity for the rat prostanoid ep3alpha
receptor isoform compared with the rat prostanoid ep1
receptor isoform (boie et al., 1997). therefore, sulprostone
was tested at 1 nm to maintain selectivity for rat prostanoid
ep3 receptors. because our ec50 value for pge2-stimulated
[3h]camp accumulation was 500 nm, that is 556-fold the ki
for pge2 in competition for [3h]pge2 binding to the rat
prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptor (boie et al., 1997), then, sulprostone
was also tested at 1mum to account for possible differences in
sensitivity of these assays.
while the extent of cicaprost-stimulated adenylyl cyclase
activity appears to be positively correlated with the proportion
of drg cells expressing neurites (p < 0.01; pearson's r = 0.923),
the [3 h]camp responses in the absence or presence of
sulprostone were overlapping and indistinguishable. therefore,
there appears to be no evidence for prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx 
coupling to gi proteins or gs proteins at any of the time points
studied (fig. 5).
4. discussion
the hyperalgesic property of pge2 is described as camp/
 xxxg1836xxx  pathway-dependent (ferreira and nakamura,
1979; hingtgen et al., 1995; cui and nicol, 1995; lopshire
and nicol, 1998), and in this current study, we have attempted
to determine the relative contribution of the prostanoid ep
receptor subtypes in modulating adenylyl cyclase activity in
isolated primary sensory neurones. in the absence of receptorspecific antagonists, southall and vasko (2001) used antisense
oligonucleotides to decrease the expression of prostanoid  xxxg1873xxx ,
ep3c and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors in rat drg cells, and concluded that
the g i/gs-coupled ep3c receptors and the gs-coupled
prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptors acted either cooperatively or
independently to stimulate camp production and increase
capsaicin-stimulated release of immunoreactive  xxxg2240xxx 
and calcitonin gene-related peptide. in the present study, the
use of potent and selective prostanoid ep receptor agonists
(suzawa et al., 2000) suggested that pge2 acts via prostanoid
 xxxg1875xxx  receptors to increase [3h]camp production, since onodi-004 (ep1), ono-ae1-259-01 ( xxxg1873xxx ), and ono-ae-248
(ep3) had no effect alone, while the prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptor
agonist  xxxd873xxx  increased [3h]camp production to a
level identical to that seen with pge2. full confirmation of
this conclusion will require the use of a potent selective
prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptor antagonist, but is supported by

observations showing that pge2 activates prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx 
receptors, and not prostanoid  xxxg1873xxx  receptors, to increase release
of  xxxg2240xxx  from renal sensory neurones (kopp et al.,
2004). from the data of [3h]pge2 binding to cloned mouse
prostanoid ep receptor subtypes (suzawa et al., 2000), one
might have predicted a prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptor-dependent
increase in [3h]camp production in rat drg cells in response
to ono-ae-248 (ep3) at 10mum. the failure of ono-ae-248
(ep3) to increase [3h]camp production may indicate a
decreased affinity of this agonist for rat prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx 
receptors compared to mouse prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptors.
southall and vasko (2001) also noted the failure of the
prostanoid  xxxg1873xxx  agonist butaprost to increase camp in
rat isolated drg cells. indeed, it has recently been suggested
that while prostanoid ep1, ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors are the
predominant prostanoid ep receptor subtypes in primary
nociceptive afferents, it is the presence of prostanoid  xxxg1873xxx 
receptors in intrinsic spinal cord neurones which are essential
mediators of pge2-induced spinal inflammatory hyperalgesia
(reinold et al., 2005).
although no direct evidence has been presented for
prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx -mediated stimulation of camp
production in drg cells, southall and vasko (2001) suggested
that inhibition of both prostanoid ep3c and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors is
necessary to decrease camp production in response to pge2
and to decrease the potentiation by pge2 of capsaicin-induced
release of immunoreactive  xxxg2240xxx  and calcitonin generelated peptide. predicting the converse, we looked for
synergistic increases in [3h]camp production in drg cells
co-stimulated with all combinations of prostanoid ep receptor
agonists, but found none. while we have not demonstrated the
presence or absence of particular prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx 
isoforms in the current study, prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx  agonists
such as pge2 and mb28767 have similar binding affinities for
human and murine prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx  isoforms (namba
et al., 1993; regan et al., 1994), and one would predict a
similar situation for rat prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx  isoforms.
therefore, the current study should have been able to identify
activation of any of the rat prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx  isoforms,
should they be coupled to the adenylyl cyclase signal
transduction pathway.
we have previously shown that the magnitude of the [3h]
camp response of adult rat drg cells to  xxxd2331xxx  (prostanoid ip
receptor agonist),  xxxd124xxx  (prostanoid ep and  xxxg1879xxx  agonist)
and pge2 (prostanoid ep receptor agonist) is influenced by the
density of cells in vitro (rowlands et al., 2001). therefore, since
the study of southall and vasko (2001) used 15,000 cells/well
compared to the present 5000cells/well, we might predict that
the expression of prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx  isoforms is increased
at higher drg cell densities. however, we found no evidence
for sulprostone-mediated activation or inhibition of adenylyl
cyclase in adult rat drg cells plated at 15,000 cells/well
(rowlands et al., 2001) or at 5000 cells/well (current study), yet
we have shown herein a sulprostone-mediated neurite retraction
response occurring at a drg cell density similar to that used in
the [3h]camp assay. therefore, although prostanoid ep3
receptors can couple to gi proteins and inhibit adenylyl cyclase

h. wise / european journal of pharmacology 535 (2006) 69–77

in some cells/tissues, they may preferentially couple to non-gi
proteins in adult rat drg cells under conditions defined within
this current study.
in human airway smooth muscle cells which respond to
both prostanoid  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptor agonists to stimulate
 xxxg1836xxx -dependent release of granulocyte colonystimulating factor (g-csf), inhibition of pge2-stimulated gcsf only occurs when both prostanoid  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors
are blocked (clarke et al., 2005). the authors reported that
exceptional receptor reserve would be needed to account for
such an effect, so suggested that there is intermolecular
crosstalk between prostanoid  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptor populations (clarke et al., 2005). in jurkat t-cells, pge2 is thought
to induce prolactin expression via simultaneous prostanoid
 xxxg1874xxx -induced increase in intracellular ca2+ concentration and prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptor-induced increase in camp. in
addition, pge2 accelerates rgd-dependent adhesion of mast
cells via cooperative activation between prostanoid ep3 and
 xxxg1875xxx  receptors (hatae et al., 2003). any such intermolecular
interactions between ep3c and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors in drg cells
would be dependent on co-localization of these receptors,
which although not yet demonstrated, but may be presumed
from the studies on neuropeptide release (southall and vasko,
2001) and would be expected to occur in the heterogenous cell
preparation described in the current study.
in this and other studies (smith et al., 1998; rowlands et
al., 2001), the prostanoid ep3/ xxxg1872xxx  agonist sulprostone
failed to increase camp production, and the prostanoid ep3
receptor selective agonist ono-ae-248 was similarly ineffective in either stimulating or inhibiting [3h]camp production. because prostanoid ep3 receptors classically inhibit
adenylyl cyclase activity via coupling to gi proteins, it has
been proposed that the weaker ability of pge2 compared to
pgi2 mimetics to dephosphorylate focal adhesion kinase in
human vascular smooth muscle cells is due to co-stimulation
of gs- and gi-coupled prostanoid ep receptors (bulin et al.,
2005). however, although prostanoid ep3 receptors are found
in sensory ganglia (jenkins et al., 2001) and on central
terminals of primary sensory neurones in intact dorsal root
ganglia (matsumura et al., 1995; beiche et al., 1998;
nakamura et al., 2000), there is no evidence that they limit
pge2-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in drg cells, or in
other sensory ganglia such as rat trigeminal neurones (jenkins
et al., 2001). even incubating rat drg cells with inflammatory mediators such as  xxxg2296xxx -alpha, interleukin1beta, or pge2, failed to influence the expression of prostanoid
ep3c mrna (fehrenbacher et al., 2005). in contrast, when
inflammation was induced in the rat knee joint, ono-ae-248
(ep3) did attenuate nociception; an effect not seen in noninflamed joints (bär et al., 2004). in addition, prostanoid ep3
receptors have been shown to be involved in hyperalgesia
induced by low doses of pge2 (minami et al., 2001).
therefore, further studies are required to determine if
upregulation of prostanoid ep3 receptors in drg cells occurs
during inflammation which could account for the relatively
small increase in [3h]camp production observed in response
to pge2 compared to  xxxg1879xxx  agonists.

75

pge2 has a higher affinity for prostanoid ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx 
receptors compared to prostanoid ep1 and  xxxg1873xxx  receptors (boie
et al., 1997), therefore, concentrations of pge2 which would
increase camp levels by stimulating prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptors
should be sufficient to stimulate prostanoid ep3 receptors in
dorsal root ganglia. sulprostone caused a rho/rho-kinasedependent, pertussis toxin-independent, retraction of neurites in
neuronal pc12 cells transfected to stably express bovine
prostanoid ep3 receptors (katoh et al., 1996). we demonstrate
here that sulprostone can also cause the retraction of drg cell
neurites in a rho-kinase-dependent manner, and predict that this
effect is also mediated via prostanoid ep3 rather than prostanoid
 xxxg1872xxx  activation by sulprostone; a conclusion further
enhanced by the demonstration that prostanoid ep3 receptors,
but not prostanoid ep1 receptors, couple to a rho/rho-kinase
pathway in mouse spinal cord (matsumura et al., 2005).
nevertheless, full confirmation of this conclusion will require
the use of potent and selective antagonists for prostanoid ep1
and ep3 receptors. the effect of pge2 to retract drg cell
neurites was much smaller than that of sulprostone and never
achieved statistical significance. pge2 has been reported to
stimulate a  xxxg1836xxx -dependent neuritogenesis response
in mouse drg cells in vitro (hiruma et al., 2000) which may
therefore account for its weak ability to cause neurite retraction
relative to sulprostone which did not increase [3h]camp
production. the functional relevance of this apparent prostanoid
 xxxg1874xxx -mediated reversible retraction of drg cell
neurites remains to be clarified, and its applicability to central
neurones is unknown.
it is notable that the amount of [3h]camp produced by pge2
was merely 45% that produced by the pgi2 mimetic cicaprost, as
previously reported (smith et al., 1998; rowlands et al., 2001),
and even pgi2 produced more [3h]camp than pge2 when
tested at 1mum. spinal cord levels of pgi2 exceed those of pge2
after injection of freund's adjuvant into the rat paw (de
belleroche et al., 1996; hay et al., 1997), and pgi2 mimetics
are often capable of directly activating sensory neurones,
whereas pge2 predominantly acts to enhance the algesic
activity of other agents (bley et al., 1998; wise and jones,
2000). therefore, the hyperalgesic property of pge2 and pgi2
may reside in highly localised changes in adenylyl cyclase
activity, or perhaps we should focus on signalling events
downstream of camp. for example, although both prostanoid
 xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors couple to gs proteins, activation of the
camp response element binding protein (creb) is protein
kinase a-dependent for prostanoid  xxxg1873xxx  receptors but is
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k)-dependent for prostanoid
 xxxg1875xxx  receptors (fujino et al., 2005). furthermore, the prostanoid
 xxxg1879xxx  also displays pi3k-dependent signalling to mitogenactivated protein kinases (chu et al., 2004).
in conclusion, pge2 acts on prostanoid  xxxg1875xxx  receptors to
increase adenylyl cyclase activity in rat drg cells, and this
effect is not influenced by co-stimulation of prostanoid ep1,  xxxg1873xxx 
or ep3 receptors. prostanoid ep3 receptors in rat drg cells
neither inhibit nor stimulate adenylyl cyclase, however they
may play a role in pain plasticity by regulating neurite
extension.
