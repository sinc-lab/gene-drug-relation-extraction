characterization of the novel progestin
gestodene by receptor binding studies
and transactivation assays
mike fuhrmann,* emily p. slater,+ and karl-heinrich fritzemeier*

gestodene is a novel progestin used in oral contraceptives
with an increased separation of progestogenic versus androgenic activity and a distinct antimineralocorticoid
activity. this specific pharmacological profile of gestodene is
defined by its pattern of binding affinities to a variety of
steroid hormone receptors. in the present study the affinity
of gestodene to the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr), the  xxxg183xxx  (ar), the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr), the
 xxxg1602xxx  (mr) and the  xxxg730xxx 
(er) was re-evaluated by steroid binding assays and compared to those obtained for  xxxd2067xxx  and progesterone. the two synthetic progestins displayed identical
high affinity to rabbit pr and similar marked binding to
rat ar and gr, while progesterone showed high affinity to
pr but only low binding to ar and gr. furthermore,
 xxxd2067xxx  exhibited almost no binding to mr,
whereas gestodene, similar to progesterone,
showed
marked affinity to this receptor. in addition to receptor
binding studies, transactivation assays were carried out to
investigate the effects of gestodene on ar-, gr- and mrmediated induction of transcription. in contrast to progesterone, which showed antiandrogenic activity, gestodene
and  xxxd2067xxx  both exhibited androgenic activity.
furthermore, all three progestins exhibited weak grmediated antagonistic activity. in contrast to progesterone, which showed almost no glucocorticoid
activity,
gestodene and  xxxd2067xxx  showed weak glucocorticoid action. in addition, gestodene inhibited the aldosterone-induced reporter gene transcription, similar to progesterone, whereas unlike progesterone, gestodene did not
induce reporter gene transcription.
 xxxd2067xxx 
showed neither antimineralocorticoid
nor mineralocorticoid action. contraception 1995;51:45-52

introduction
derivative gestodene is a
he 19nortestosterone
novel progestin used in oral contraceptives. ‘j
structurally,
this compound is closely related
to levonorgestrel differing by a double bond between
c-atoms 15 and 16. this structural modification
is
responsible for the unique pharmacodynamic
profile
of gestodene compared to levonorgestrel and other 19nortestosterone
derivatives
like  xxxd2067xxx .
gestodene is the most potent of all progestins used in
ocs and exhibits an improved separation of progestogenie versus androgenic activity.’ another characteristic feature of gestodene is its antimineralocorticoid
activity3 which is also shared by the natural hormone
progesterone.
the specific pharmacological
profile of gestodene
is partly based on its pattern of binding affinities to
a variety of steroid hormone receptors. the aim of
the present study was to re-evaluate the interaction
of gestodene with the steroid receptors by competition experiments.
in order to obtain additional
information
about the pharmacological
profile of
gestodene, the steroid agonistic and antagonistic
properties of this progestin were evaluated in vitro by
transactivation
assays. the transactivation
assay assumes steroid receptor proteins to act as ligandregulated transcriptional
activators. after binding of
hormone the steroid receptor interacts with hormoneresponsive elements (hres) of hormone-regulated
genes, thereby inducing a cascade of transcriptional
events.4 the hormone-dependent
transcriptional
activation can be determined in tissue culture by transfection of the steroid receptor under investigation
and a reporter gene linked to a hormonally
responsive promoter into cells. this transactivation
assay
not only allows determination
of the agonistic but
also the antagonistic potency of a given compound,
by either induction
or inhibition
of reporter gene
activity.5 the results of the receptor binding studies
and the transactivation
assays are discussed with regard to receptor studies published earlier6 and to the
pharmacodynamic
profile of gestodene observed in

to determine the androgenic or antiandrogenic

stably transfected with the rat ar (rar) and a reporter

were used.5 ar-mediated

increasing amounts of either gestodene, progesterone
or  xxxd2067xxx ,
as illustrated in figure 1a. as a
positive control for ar-mediated reporter gene induction, cells were cultured in the presence of the synthetic androgen  xxxd2631xxx . in contrast to progesterone,
which showed no androgenic activity, gestodene and
 xxxd2067xxx 
both exhibited comparable androgenie potency. to study ar-mediated

(figure 3b).  xxxd2067xxx  showed neither mineralocorticoid

discussion
in the present study, we performed a broad characterization of the biochemical profile of the synthetic progestin, gestodene,
in comparison
with  xxxd2067xxx  and progesterone by using two different in
vitro assay systems. first, the binding affinity of the
three progestins to the five steroid hormone receptors
was investigated. based on the observation that steroid receptors act as ligand regulated transcriptional
activators,4 we then employed a transactivation
assay
to determine the agonistic or antagonistic activities

of the three compounds mediated by these receptors.
this assay was carried out for those receptors to
which the three progestins
under investigation
showed detectable binding affinity. in general, the results obtained with the in vitro transactivation
assays
are consistent with those obtained from animal studies for all receptors tested.
our receptor binding study revealed that gestodene
and  xxxd2067xxx 
exhibit a similarly high binding affinity to the rabbit pr (table 1). this finding is
in agreement with pharmacological
studies in rabbits
and rats as well as in humans, indicating that the two
compounds display similar progestogenic activity in
vivo. in studies with female rats, gestodene was found
to be slightly more potent than  xxxd2067xxx .’
in
accordance with this observation, a higher rba was
found for gestodene compared to  xxxd2067xxx 
in
studies with pr from rat uterus.‘4 using human uterine cytosol, a somewhat lower affinity was reported
for gestodene in comparison with  xxxd2067xxx .6
these divergent results could reflect species-specific
differences with regard to the binding of the two synthetic progestins to rabbit, rat or human pr, respectively. however, regarding the in vivo progestogenic

contraception
1995;51:4!5-52

activity in humans, gestodene was shown to be the
most potent of all progestins used in oc combination
pills, the limiting dosage for ovulation inhibition
in
humans being 40 pg.i4fi5
the rba of gestodene to rat prostate ar was found
to be one-third of that of  xxxd2631xxx  (table 1) and was
two-fold higher than that of  xxxd2067xxx 
(table
1). almost identical results were obtained for mouse
kidney ar.i4,i6 these data differed from studies carried out by pollow et a1.6 where gestodene showed
100% binding affinity to rat ar relative to  xxxd2631xxx .
the in vitro transactivation
assay with cv-1 cells,
stably transfected with rat ar and an ar-responsive
reporter gene (mmtv-cat),
revealed that the androgenie potency of both gestodene and  xxxd2067xxx  is about ten-fold lower in comparison with  xxxd2631xxx 
(figure 1a). in vivo studies on the androgenic potency
of the two compounds have been performed with rats
and mice. with regard to the stimulation
of seminal
vesicle weight in castrated male rats, gestodene was
active as an androgen at an about ten-fold higher dose,
and  xxxd2067xxx 
at a thirty-fold
higher dose
than testosterone prc)pionate.2 in mice, gestodene and
 xxxd1849xxx  (the prodrug of &keto- xxxd1849xxx )
were
equipotent in stimulating
the activity of p-glucuronidase, an ar-regulated protein of the kidney.“*”
progesterone displayed low affinity to the rat ar
(table 1) and was devoid of agonistic activity in the
transactivation
assay carried out with cv- 1 cells (figure 1b). remarkably,
in this assay the natural hormone progesterone exhibits antiandrogenic
activity
which is slightly lower than that of  xxxd1786xxx . this finding is i:n agreement with in viva studies
performed in chicken, mouse and rat.”
both gestodene and  xxxd2067xxx 
showed a
marked binding affinity to the gr. despite the relatively high receptor affinity, in vivo studies in juvenile rats, using glucocorticoid
action on thymus involution
as a parameter,
revealed that the two
compounds exhibited negligible glucocorticoid
(3000fold lower activity than dexamethasone
upon s.c. application) and no antiglucocorticoid
activity (unpublished data). in the transactivation
assay in vitro,
gestodene and  xxxd2067xxx 
were found to exhibit lower glucocorticoid
activity than dexamethasone, progesterone being almost inactive (figure 2a).
in addition, the three progestins showed weak antiglucocorticoid
activity in this assay (figure 2b).
recent studies on #the affinity of gestodene to the
mr revealed unexpettedly
high affinity of this compound to rat kidney mr (rba value of 350% compared to aldosterone)6 whereas  xxxd2067xxx 
exhibited less than 0.1% of the affinity of aldosterone.
the rba of progesterone was 100%. we re-evaluated

biochemical characterization of gestodene

these data, using a mammalian
expression system to
produce hmr for competition
experiments in cos-1
cells which are devoid of detectable amounts of other
steroid hormone receptors. with this approach we
were able to exclude difficulties
that commonly impede the interpretation
of results obtained with crude
cytosol fractions from kidney tissue. kidney cytosol
contains high concentrations
of gr but only low levels of mr. using hmr expressed in cos-1 cells, we
found about 10% rba for gestodene compared to the
reference compound aldosterone, and a twenty-fold
lower rba for 3keto- xxxd1849xxx 
in comparison with
gestodene (table 1). progesterone displayed an rba of
100% in this assay. the hmr-regulated
transactivation assay revealed that the two synthetic progestins
did not act as agonists whereas progesterone showed
marginal activity (figure 3a). furthermore, progesterone exhibited strong antimineralocorticoid
activity,
which was comparable to that of the antimineralocorticoid zk 91 587 (figure 3b). in addition, gestodene
showed considerable antagonistic
activity, whereas
 xxxd2067xxx 
was not effective as an antimineralocorticoid. the in vitro results with gestodene corresponded to the weak antialdosterone
activity observed with this compound in adrenalectomized
rats
treated with aldosterone. in these animals, gestodene
stimulated urinary sodium excretion.3 in this respect
gestodene resembled progesterone, which displays a
natriuretic
effect in physiological
doses in man.”
however, the weak antimineralocorticoid
activity observed for gestodene in the test systems mentioned
above is not relevant for the clinical application
of
this compound.
as was also reported by others,6t14 none of the three
progestins included in the present study showed affinity to the er. therefore, it was not necessary to
carry out studies for  xxxg730xxx -dependent
transactivation.
in conclusion,
our in vitro studies confirmed results from in viva studies demonstrating
that the
pharmacological
profile of gestodene is closely related
to that of the natural hormone progesterone.
the
compound
combines high progestogenic
potency
with reduced androgenic activity as compared to
other progestins of the 19nortestosterone
series.’ in
addition, gestodene shows antimineralocorticoid
activity. furthermore, our study demonstrated
that the
receptor binding affinities alone are not sufficient to
predict the pharmacological
profile of gestodene in
viva. the transcription
activation assay, however, allowed us to determine agonistic activity for gestodene
with regard to the  xxxg183xxx  and antagonistic
activity with regard to the mineralocorticoid
receptor. in addition, the observation that gestodene acts as

52

fuhrmann et al.

a partial agonist/antagonist
on gr-mediated
transcription in vitro provides a possible explanation for
the apparent discrepancy between the marked binding affinity of gestodene to the gr and the negligible
glucocorticoid
activity in vivo.
