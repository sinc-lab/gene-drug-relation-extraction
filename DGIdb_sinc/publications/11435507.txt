retinoid compounds activate and induce hepatic  xxxg928xxx  in rats.   xxxg928xxx  ( xxxg928xxx ) functions to regulate  xxxd3156xxx  (sam) levels and the ratio of sam/s- xxxd3157xxx  (sah). sam is a universal methyl group donor and the up-regulation of  xxxg928xxx  may lead to wastage of methyl groups required for transmethylation reactions. previously, we demonstrated that dietary treatment of rats with 13- xxxd2404xxx  (cra) decreased the hepatic concentration of sam and the sah ratio. here, we examined the ability of cra, as well as  xxxd3417xxx  (atra), to regulate hepatic  xxxg928xxx  as a potential basis for our earlier observations. rats were fed either a control (10% casein + 0.3%  xxxd2595xxx ) diet or a control diet supplemented with  xxxd2595xxx  (10 g/kg diet). rats from each group were orally given atra, cra (both at 30 micromol/kg body), or vehicle daily for 7 d. for control rats, administration of both cra and atra elevated the hepatic  xxxg928xxx  activity 49% and 34%, respectively, compared with the control group. similar results were exhibited by rats fed the methionine-supplemented diet. moreover, the retinoid-induced elevations in enzyme activity were reflected in the abundance of  xxxg928xxx  protein. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a nutritional compound that induces  xxxg928xxx  activity at the transcriptional and/or translational level.
