the synthesis and resolution of 1,2,3,4,10,14b-hexahydro-6-methoxy-2-methyldibenzo[c,f]pyrazino[1,2-a]azepin (6-methoxymianserin, 6) are described. furthermore, the in vitro and
in vivo effects of 6 and its enantiomers are presented. 6 displayed high affinity for the 5-ht2a/
2c receptors, only moderate affinity for the adrenoceptors, and no affinity for the na reuptake
site. surprisingly, 6 also showed moderate to high affinity for the dopamine  xxxg656xxx , an
effect that resides in the (r)-(-)-enantiomer.
introduction
depression has long been associated with decreased
levels of both noradrenaline (na) and serotonin (5-ht)
in the central nervous system.1,2 the marketed antidepressants mirtazapine (1,  xxxd2651xxx , remeron)
and  xxxd2637xxx  (2,  xxxd2637xxx ) possess a tetracyclic structure
in which an arylpiperazine moiety is incorporated. the

mechanisms of action of these two antidepressants,
however, are believed to be different.
the pharmacological profile of 1 is characterized by
r2, 5-ht2, 5-ht3, and  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist properties. the increase in rat hippocampal levels
of na and 5-ht after administration of 1 are believed
to be due to r2-adrenoceptor antagonism.3-6 the r2autoreceptor and the  xxxg1113xxx  blocking effects of
1 are known to reside predominantly in the (+)enantiomer, while the (-)-enantiomer is responsible for
blockage of the r2-heteroreceptor (located on the nerve
terminals of the 5-ht neurons) and the  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonism.7,8 the pharmacological profile of 2 is
characterized by antagonistic properties at the 5-ht2,
5-ht3,  xxxg1078xxx , and the na reuptake site. the
increase in rat hippocampal levels of na after administration of 2 is believed to be due to blockage of the
na reuptake site. the na reuptake and 5-ht2 blocking

effects of 2 are known to reside in the (+)-enantiomer,
while the (-)-enantiomer is responsible for the 5-ht3
receptor antagonism.9-11 both antidepressants have
negligible affinity for the dopamine  xxxg656xxx .
in this paper, we report the synthesis and resolution
of the 6-methoxy analogue of  xxxd2637xxx  (2) 1,2,3,4,10,14bhexahydro-6-methoxy-2-methyldibenzo[c,f]pyrazino[1,2a]azepin (6). it is noteworthy that the o-methoxyphenylpiperazine moiety, inherent in the chemical structure
of compound 6, is present in several pharmacologically
active compounds that act through the serotonergic
system.12-15
the in vitro receptor affinities of 6-methoxymianserin
(6) and both its enantiomers at the different dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, and histaminergic receptor subtypes, as well as at the na and the 5-ht
reuptake sites, were determined. in a microdialysis
study in the ventral hippocampus of awake, freely
moving rats, the in vivo effects of 5 mg/kg sc of 6 and
2.5 mg/kg sc of either of its enantiomers on the release
of na and 5-ht and their metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
(5-hiaa) were established. dopac is a metabolite
formed both in dopaminergic and in noradrenergic
neurons. in brain areas with no dopaminergic innervation, like the locus ceruleus and the ventral hippocampus, dopac release is believed to reflect noradrenergic
activity.16,17 the result of this microdialysis study is
compared with previously reported effects of similar
doses of 1 and 2.4
chemistry
6 was synthesized as follows (scheme 1). styrene
oxide and 2-methylaminoethanol were reacted at 130
°c, yielding beta-hydroxy-n-methyl-n-hydroxyethylphenyl
ethylamine (3), which was converted to the chlorinated
phenylethylamine 4 upon treatment with thionyl chloride in refluxing chloroform. 2-amino-3-methoxybenzoic
acid was reduced to the corresponding alcohol in thf

the ability of 1, 2, 6, and its enantiomers to displace

results and discussion
the binding study (table 1) shows that 6 has high
affinity for the 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors, which
is found in both enantiomers. while both 1 and 2 have
high affinity for the  xxxg1116xxx , 6 is devoid of
affinity for this receptor subtype. 6 displays only moderate affinity and no selectivity for the r1- and r2adrenoceptors and displays no affinity for the na
reuptake site. the (s)-(+)-enantiomer of 6 shows remarkable selectivity for the  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes.
surprisingly, the (r)-(-)-enantiomer showed a moderate
affinity for the dopamine  xxxg656xxx . in antipsychotic
research, the ratio 5-ht2a/d2 affinity, the “meltzer
ratio”, is used as a marker to classify atypical neuroleptics such as clozapine.31 the “meltzer ratio” of (-)-6
to clozapine is highly favorable.32 the moderate affinity
of the (-)-enantiomer for the r2-adrenoceptor may add
to a possible positive antipsychotic profile, since it was
recently shown that r2-antagonists potentiate the cortical output of dopamine.33 the two other 6-substituted
analogues 7 and 8 were only tested on a few receptors
(table 1), and these data are not further discussed.
in a previous microdialysis study in the rat ventral
hippocampus, it was shown that 1 (5 mg/kg sc) causes
an increase in dopac levels up to 200% above baseline
(90-150 min) and a transient increase in 5-ht levels
up to 180% after 60 min.4 a similar dose of 2 induced
an increase in dopac levels up to 160% above baseline
(90-150 min) but had no effect on the 5-ht release.4
administration of 1 had no effect on the 5-hiaa release.
administration of 6 (5.0 mg/kg sc) causes an increase
in na levels up to 200% (45-150 min) and in dopac
levels up to 160% above baseline (60-150 min). fur-

atypical antipsychotic clozapine justifies future studies
of this enantiomer for its potential as an antipsychotic
agent.
experimental section

figure 1. effects of 6-methoxymianserin and its enantiomers
on dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic transmission. effects were measured by on-line microdialysis of the
racemic mixture 6 (5.0 mg/kg sc, n ) 4) and the (r)-(-)-6 and
(s)-(+)-6 enantiomers (each 2.5 mg/kg sc, n ) 6) on na,
dopac, 5-ht, and 5-hiaa release in the rat ventral hippocampus. results are expressed as the area under the curve
and refer to cumulative percentage above baseline. statistics
are from mann-whitney rank sum test: (/) p < 0.05 compared
to control; (#) p < 0.05 compared to 2.

thermore, it induces a concurrent, transient increase of
5-ht levels up to 200% above baseline at 60 min after
administration of 6, with stabilization at 140-150%
further during the course of the experiment. administration of (-)- or (+)-6 (2.5 mg/kg sc) also resulted in
an increase in na levels up to 200% (45-150 min). the
dopac levels were elevated to 160% and 130% above
baseline for (-)- and (+)-6, respectively (60-150 min).
both enantiomers induced a transient, concurrent increase of the 5-ht release up to 200% above baseline
at 60 min after administration of the test compound.
the 5-hiaa release was elevated up to 120% after the
administration of the racemic mixture or of either of the
enantiomers (significant for the (-)-enantiomer). for a
graphical representation of the microdialysis data, see
figure 1.
in summary, 6, a new tetracyclic azepine, showed
high affinity for the 5-ht2a/2c receptors, moderate
affinity for the r1- and r2-adrenoceptors, and no affinity
for the  xxxg1116xxx  and for the na reuptake sites.
in vivo, it increases the levels of na and 5-ht to the
same extent as 1. the (r)-(-)-enantiomer of 6 appears
to be more potent in the microdialysis study than the
(s)-(+)-enantiomer (significant only for the dopac
release). this implies that at least the neurochemical
effects of 6 are similar to those of the antidepressant 1.
future studies in animal models of depression will have
to prove whether 6 has prospective antidepressant
properties. the unexpected finding that (r)-(-)-6, in
vitro, shows moderate affinity for the  xxxg656xxx 
subtype and a favorable “meltzer ratio” compared to the

chromatographic (hplc) resolution of racemic 6 on
a chiral stationary phase. the semipreparative lc system
consisted of a chiralcel od column: daicel chemical industry

ltd. (tokyo, japan) 25 cm × 1.0 cm i.d., 10 µm particle size
silica gel; isco 2300 hplc pump equipped with a rheodyne
injection valve and 1 ml injection loop; isco v4 absorbance
detector with a 5 µl flow cell (lambda ) 250 nm, pathway 5 mm);
kipp and zonen bd 40 two-channel recorder; mobile phase,
n-hexane with 5% ethanol (hplc grade) and 0.1% triethylamine (analytical grade); flow rate of 4.0 ml/min at ca. 0.5
psi. the favorable separation of the two enantiomers allowed
for injecting 5 mg of racemic 6 per run. the direct separation
by means of hplc using a chiralcel od column afforded 50
mg each of the base form of the enantiomers (-)-6 ([r]21d
-403.0°) and (+)-6 ([r]21d +407.6°), both rotations measured
at c ) 2.0 mg/ml meoh.
indirect determination of the absolute configuration
of (-)-6. o-demethylation of an analytical amount of (-)-6
(20 mg) was effected, as descibed for the preparation of racemic
7 above, upon treatment with 6 equiv of alcl3 in freshly
distilled, refluxing benzene, providing (-)-6-hydroxymianserin
((-)-7), which was triflated without further purification with
trifluoromethanesulfonyl anhydride in ch2cl2 and in the
presence of triethylamine. this yielded 6-trifluoromethanesulfonyloxymianserin ((-)-8), which was detriflated, without
further purification, with palladium acetate in refluxing
methanol in the presence of triphenylphospine and triethylamine to afford, after purification, 10 mg of (-)-2 (scheme 2),
as determined by measuring the k′, which under the present
condition was measured to be 0.77, which is the same as that
measured for an authentic sample of (-)-2 ((+)-2 shows a k′
) 1.00).19
biological assays. for the microdialysis experiments male
wistar rats (280-350 g) were used. the animals were housed
in groups (four rats per cage) in a temperature- and humiditycontrolled colony room (20 ( 2 °c; 50-60%) on a natural daynight cycle (light period 6:30-18:30) until surgery. food and
water were available ad libitum at all times. testing was done
between 10:00 and 18:00 during the light phase of the daynight cycle. procedures were conducted in accordance with
guidelines published in the nih guide for the care and use
of laboratory animals, and protocols were approved by the
groningen university institutional animal care and use
committee.
affinities of compounds were determined using competition
binding assays to determine ic50 values at the various receptors: dopamine d2 receptors, displacement of 0.50 nm [3h]spiperone at membranes from rat corpus striatum;20 h- xxxg657xxx , displacement of 0.30 nm [3h]-spiperone at
human-cloned d3 receptors expressed in cho-cells;21 hdopamine d4.2 receptor, displacement of 0.06 nm [3h]-ym09151-2 at human-cloned d4.2 receptors expressed in chocells (method modified from nen life science products, inc.,
technical data certificate pc2533-10/96); h-serotonin 5-ht1a
receptor, displacement of 2 nm [3h]-5-ct at human-cloned
5-ht1a receptors expressed in hela cells.22 additional parameters are as follows: serotonin  xxxg1110xxx  receptor, displacement of 2 nm [3h]-5-ct at membranes from bovine caudate
tissue;23 serotonin  xxxg1113xxx , displacement of 0.50 nm
[3h]- xxxd2419xxx  at membranes from rat cortex tissue;24 serotonin  xxxg1115xxx , displacement of 0.50 nm [3h]-mesulergine from rat cloned 5-ht2c receptors expressed in nih/

were estimated from hand-drawn log-logit analysis. in a
series of n determinations, the variance of the log ratio (varr)
between the double determinations is determined according
to the formula varr ) sigma(log r1)2/(2n), where r1 is the ratio
and n is the number of observations. the varr is equivalent
to the square of the standard deviation of the log ratio (sdr2).
in case the ratio is greater than that corresponding to 2 ×
sdr (95% confidence interval), further determinations were
performed and outliers discarded. for the binding analysis,
the following sdrs were obtained: d2, 1.5 (n ) 100); d3, 1.4
(n ) 26); d4.2, 1.4 (n ) 26); 5-ht1a, 1.5 (n ) 24);  xxxg1110xxx ,
see ref 23; 5-ht2a, 1.4 (n ) 100); 5-ht2c, 1.3 (n ) 24); r1,
1.5 (n ) 100), see ref 26; h1, see ref 27; h2, see ref 28; 5-ht
and na uptake, 95% confidence ratios of 2.04 and 2.68,
respectively.3
microdialysis30 rats were anaesthetized with ketamine/
xylazine (50/8 mg/kg ip) and atropine (0.1 mg/kg sc) after a
premedication of midazolam (5 mg/kg sc). preceding insertion
of the microdialysis probe, rats were placed in a stereotaxic
frame (kopf). following local lidocaine application (10% m/v),
a homemade i-shaped probe, made of polyacrylonitrile/sodium
methyl sulfonate copolymer dialysis fiber (i.d. 0.22 mm, o.d.
0.31 mm, an 69, hospal, italy) was implanted in the ventral
hippocampus (coordinates: (ia) +3.7 mm; (lateral) +4.8 mm;
(ventral) -8.0 mm from the dura mater, paxinos and watson,
1982) and secured with stainless steel screws and dental
cement. the exposed length of the membrane was 4 mm. after
surgery, rats were allowed a recovery period of at least 24 h
before starting the experiments. probes were perfused with
artificial csf containing 147 mm nacl, 3.0 mm kcl, 1.2 mm
cacl2, and 1.2 mm mgcl2, at a speed of 1.5 µl/min (harvard
apparatus, south natick, ma). rats were housed individually
in plexiglas cages (25 cm × 25 cm × 35 cm) with food and
water ad libitum. samples were collected on-line in a 20 µl
loop and injected automatically onto the column every 15 min.
5-ht was analyzed using an hplc pump (shimadzu lc-10
ad liquid chromatograph) in combination with a reversedphase column (phenomenex  xxxd3100xxx  3 c18, 100 mm × 2.0 mm,
3 µm, bester, amstelveen, the netherlands) and an ec
detector with a carbon electrode (intro, antec leyden, leiden,
the netherlands) working at a potential of 500 mv vs ag/
agcl reference electrode. the mobile phase consisted of 5.0
g/l (nh4)2so4, 0.5 g/l edta, 50.0 mg/l heptanesulfonic acid,
and 30 µl/l triethylamine in 4.5% methanol (v/v) at ph 4.65
and 30 °c. the flow of the mobile phase was set at 400 µl/
min. the detection limit of 5-ht was 0.5 fmol per 20 µl of
sample (signal-to-noise ratio of 2). na, dopac, and hiaa
were analyzed using an hplc pump (shimadzu lc-10 ad
liquid chromatograph) in combination with a reversed-phase
column (c18, 15 mm × 0.46 mm, 3 m, supelco, zwijndrecht,
the netherlands). quantification was performed using an
electrochemical detector (esa, bedford, ma). upon oxidation
at 175 mv, molecules were reduced at -250 mv. the mobile
phase consisted of 4.1 g/l sodiumacetate, 140.0 mg/l octanesulfonic acid, 50.0 mg/l edta, and 7% methanol (v/v (ph )
4.4.). at a flow of 1 ml/min, the detection limit of the assay
was 2 fmol/sample (signal-to-noise ratio of 2). four consecutive
microdialysis samples with less than 20% difference were
considered as control and set at 100%. data are presented as
percentages of control level (mean + sem). statistical analysis
was performed using sigmastat for windows (jandel corporation). treatment values were compared using two-way anova
for repeated measurements, followed by student newmankeuls posthoc analysis. for the area under the curves, a
mann-whitney rank sum test was performed. significance
levels were set at p < 0.05.
