in unanaethetised rats with a single injection of compound 48r80, a mast cell degranulator
ž0.75 mg kgy1 , i.p.., gastric lesions occurred with increased serum serotonin and histamine
levels and reduced gastric mucosal blood flow at 0.5 h after the injection and developed at 3
h. pretreatment with either  xxxd1785xxx  ža serotonin and histamine antagonist. or
 xxxd2621xxx  ža serotonin antagonist. prevented the formation of gastric mucosal lesions
with attenuation of reduced gastric mucosal blood flow at 0.5 h after compound 48r80
injection, while pretreatment with either amitriptyline ža selective inhibitor of histamine
release from mast cells.,  xxxd3443xxx  ža histamine h 1-receptor antagonist.,  xxxd2082xxx 
ža histamine h 2-receptor antagonist. or cimetidine ža histamine h 2-receptor antagonist.
had no effect. pretreatment with either  xxxd1785xxx ,  xxxd2621xxx , amitriptyline or
 xxxd3443xxx  prevented the development of gastric mucosal lesions at 3 h after compound 48r80 injection, while pretreatment with either  xxxd2082xxx  or cimetidine had no
effect. these results indicate that in unanaesthetised rats with a single compound 48r80
treatment, acutely released endogenous serotonin causes gastric mucosal lesions, while
released endogenous histamine mainly contributes to the lesion development and that
gastric acid plays little role in the pathogenesis of the compound 48r80-induced acute
gastric lesions.

introduction
the ulcerogenic effect of serotonin and its precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan on the stomach of experimental animals has been reported by many investigators w1]4x. the ulcerogenic effect of histamine on
the stomach of experimental animals has also been
reported w5, 6x. it has been demonstrated that in
rats, compound 48r80 treatment induces degranulation of connective tissue mast cells such as peritoneal mast cells, but not mucosal mast cells, resulting in the release of serotonin and histamine from
the connective tissue mast cells w7]9x. a single or
repeated administration of compound 48r80 induces
gastric mucosal lesions in rats w10]14x. recently, we
have reported that in unanaesthetised rats with a
single injection of compound 48r80, gastric mucosal

lesions occur with increased serum serotonin level
and reduced gastric mucosal blood flow through
degranulation of connective tissue mast cells w14x.
takeuchi et al. w11x have shown that in anaesthetised
rats with a single compound 48r80 treatment, gastric mucosal lesions are caused by acutely released
endogenous histamine through histamine h 1- and
h 2-receptors, but not released endogenous serotonin. however, takeuchi et al. w12x have reported
that in unanaesthetised rats with repeated compound 48r80 treatment, gastric mucosal lesions are
caused primarily by the release of serotonin, but not
histamine, from extragastric sources. accordingly,
the possibility can be assumed that in unanaesthetised rats with a single compound 48r80 treatment, gastric mucosal lesions are caused primarily
by acutely released endogenous serotonin, but not
released endogenous histamine. however, this possibility has not been confirmed yet.
in the present study, we attempted to clarify the

gastric mucosal lesion induction by compound 48 r 80

compound 48r80 ž0.75 mg kgy1 ., dissolved in
distilled water, was injected i.p. to 7-week-old male
wistar rats fasted for 24 h, which were purchased
from slc co. žhamamatsu, japan., under nonanaesthesia as described previously w14x. the control
rats received an i.p. injection of an equal volume of
distilled water. all animals were maintained with
free access to water and without food during the
experiment. the animals were killed under ether
anaesthesia 0.5 and 3 h after compound 48r80 injection. the stomachs were removed, inflated with 10
ml of 0.9% nacl, and put into 10% formalin for 10
min. the stomachs were then opened along the
greater curvature and examined for lesions in the
glandular part under a dissecting microscope ž=10..
the severity of gastric mucosal lesions was estimated
using the index of the following eight grades of
lesions as described in our previous report w14x:
grade 0, no lesion žnormal.; grade i, edema only;
grade ii, damaged area of 1]10 mm2 ; grade iii,
damaged area of 11]20 mm2 ; grade iv, damaged
area of 21]30 mm2 ; grade v, damaged area of

measurements of serum serotonin and histamine
for serum serotonin and histamine measurements, blood was collected from the inferior vena
cava of rats upon killing and then serum was obtained from the collected blood by centrifugation.
serum samples were deproteinised by adding perchloric acid at a final concentration of 3% and then
centrifuged at 48c for 10 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000= g. serum
serotonin was measured by the method of shibata et
al. w22x using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection except that 40
mm sodium dihydrogenphosphate used as the mobile
phase was replaced by 0.1 m  xxxd1710xxx ]0.1 m sodium
acetate ž0.7:1.0 vrv.. methylserotonin was used as
an internal standard. serum histamine was measured by the methods of lorenz et al. w23x and shore
et al. w24x. histamine was reacted with o-phthalaldehyde and the intensity of the resultant fluorescence was measured using a spectrofluorometer žthe
excitation wavelength, 360 nm; the fluorescence
wavelength, 450 nm..

measurement of gastric blood flow
gastric blood flow was measured using a laser
doppler flowmeter, laser flow brl-100 žbio research center co., nagoya, japan. as described in
our previous report w15x. rats used for this measurement were anaesthetised with pentobarbital sodium
10 min before the onset of the measurement and the
abdomen was opened on an operation mat. the mat
was heated at 378c during the operation and blood
flow measurement. the laser probe was attached to
the serosal side of the corpus mucosa by aid of aron
alpha žtoha gosei co., tokyo, japan., and the
blood flow changes were monitored on a recorder
for at least 5 min after the onset of the measurement. gastric mucosal blood flow in compound
48r80-treated rats is expressed as a relative percentage toward the mean value of gastric mucosal blood
flow determined in control rats without compound
48r80 treatment.

leased endogenous serotonin contributes to the formation of acute gastric mucosal lesions, while released endogenous histamine mainly contributes to
the development of the gastric mucosal lesions.
we have demonstrated that in unanaesthetised
rats with a single compound 48r80 treatment, acute
gastric mucosal lesions are caused by degranulation
of connective tissue mast cells in which a rapid
reduction of gastric mucosal blood flow occurs w14x.
it has been shown that in rats treated once with
compound 48r80, serotonin and histamine are released from connective tissue mast cells w7]9x. in
unanaesthetised rats injected once with compound
48r80, the formation of acute gastric mucosal lesions, which was checked 0.5 h after the injection,
was prevented by pretreatment with either
 xxxd1785xxx , a serotonin and histamine antagonist w15, 16x or  xxxd2621xxx , a serotonin antagonist
w16x, but not amitriptyline, a selective inhibitor of
histamine release from mast cells w17]20x,  xxxd3443xxx , a histamine h 1-receptor antagonist w21x, or
 xxxd2082xxx  and cimetidine, histamine h 2-receptor
antagonists w21x. these results suggest that in
unanaesthetised rats treated once with compound
48r80, the formation of acute gastric mucosal lesions could be closely related to endogenous serotonin released from mast cells. similar increases in
serum serotonin and histamine concentrations were
observed in compound 48r80-injected rats pretreated with and without either  xxxd1785xxx  or
 xxxd2621xxx  at 0.5 h after compound 48r80 injection, although the reduction of gastric mucosal blood
flow in the compound 48r80-injected rats pretreated
with either  xxxd1785xxx  or  xxxd2621xxx  was
much less than that in the compound 48r80-injected
rats without any pretreatment. increased serum
serotonin and histamine concentrations and reduced
gastric mucosal blood flow found in compound
48r80-injected rats pretreated with either  xxxd3443xxx ,  xxxd2082xxx  or cimetidine were not different
from those in compound 48r80-injected rats without
any pretreatment at 0.5 h after compound 48r80
injection. at 0.5 h after compound 48r80 injection,
compound 48r80-injected rats with amitriptyline
pretreatment showed increased serum serotonin
concentration and reduced gastric mucosal blood
flow similar to those found in compound 48r80injected rats in spite of a marked attenuation of
increased serum histamine concentration. these results allow us to think that the reduction of gastric
mucosal blood flow induced by endogenous serotonin released from mast cells contributes to the
formation of acute gastric mucosal lesions in
unanaesthetised rats injected once with compound
48r80. thus, endogenous serotonin, but not endogenous histamine, released from mast cells plays
an important role in the formation of acute gastric
mucosal lesions in unanaesthetised rats with a single
compound 48r80 treatment. this role of released

pharmacological research, vol. 39, no. 4, 1999

endogenous serotonin is similar to the case of
unanaesthetised rats with repeated compound 48r80
treatment, but is clearly different from the case of
anaesthetised rats with a single compound 48r80
treatment. it has been shown in unanaesthetised
rats injected with compound 48r80 ž0.75 mg kgy1 .
once daily for 4 successive days that endogenous
serotonin, but not endogenous histamine, released
from mast cells mainly contributes to the formation
of gastric mucosal lesions w12x. in contrast, it has
been shown in anaesthetised rats injected once with
compound 48r80 ž0.5]2 mg kgy1 . that acute gastric
mucosal lesions occur when the lesion is checked 2 h
after compound 48r80 injection and that pretreatment with either fpl-52694 ža mast cell stabiliser .,
 xxxd3443xxx  or cimetidine prevents the compound 48r80-induced gastric mucosal lesion formation, while pretreatment with  xxxd2621xxx  has no
effect w11x. and, it has been suggested that acutely
released endogenous histamine may be involved in
the formation of acute gastric mucosal lesions in
anaesthetised rats with a single compound 48r80
injection via activation of histamine h 1- and h 2receptors w11x. however, it is unclear at present why
the role of endogenous serotonin and histamine
released from mast cells in the pathogenesis of acute
gastric mucosal lesions induced by a single compound 48r80 treatment is different between anaesthetised and unanaesthetised rats. accordingly, further investigation is required to clarify this discrepancy.
when the preventive effects of  xxxd1785xxx ,
 xxxd2621xxx , amitriptyline,  xxxd3443xxx ,  xxxd2082xxx , and cimetidine pretreatments on the development of acute gastric mucosal lesions in rats with a
single compound 48r80 injection were further examined 3 h after the injection, not only  xxxd1785xxx  and  xxxd2621xxx  pretreatments but also
amitriptyline and  xxxd3443xxx  pretreatments were
found to prevent the gastric mucosal lesion development. these results suggest that not only endogenous serotonin but also endogenous histamine
released from mast cells could contribute to the
development of acute gastric mucosal lesions induced by a single compound 48r80 treatment in
unanaesthetised rats. takeuchi et al. w12x have shown
that in unanaesthetised rats, repeated injection of
both serotonin ž10 mg kgy1 dayy1 ., the dose of
which induces gastric mucosal lesions, and histamine
ž10 mg kgy1 dayy1 ., the dose of which does not
induce gastric mucosal lesions, for 4 successive days
induces gastric mucosal lesions more potently than
does repeated serotonin injection done in the same
manner, although the gastric mucosal lesions induced by repeated serotonin plus histamine injection
is inhibited by cotreatment with either  xxxd1785xxx  or  xxxd2621xxx , but not  xxxd3443xxx  or
cimetidine. in addition, the same authors have shown
that the gastric mucosal lesions of unanaesthetised

265

rats injected repeatedly with serotonin plus histamine are similar to those of unanaesthetised rats
injected repeatedly with compound 48r80, and have
suggested that endogenous histamine released from
mast cells could play an aggravative role in the
gastric mucosal lesions of unanaesthetised rats with
repeated compound 48r80 treatment w12x. it has
also been shown that in unanaesthetised rats injected once with compound 48r80 at a dose of 0.75
mg kgy1 , serum histamine level significantly increases 30 min after the injection and that this
increased serum histamine level returns to normal
later than 4 h after the injection w12x. these findings
may allow us to assume that endogenous histamine
released from mast cells plays an aggravative role in
the acute gastric mucosal lesions of unanaesthetised
rats with a single compound 48r80 injection. kubes
et al. w25x have shown that histamine induces leucocyte rolling in post-capillary venules and that this
histamine-induced leucocyte rolling is prevented by
diphenhydramine ža histamine h 1-receptor antagonist., but not cimetidine ža histamine h 2-receptor
antagonist.. asako et al. w26x have also shown that
histamine recruits rolling leucocytes in post-capillary
venules and that this histamine-induced recruitment
of rolling leucocytes is prevented by hydroxyzine
and diphehydramine žhistamine h 1-receptor antagonists., but not cimetidine ža histamine h 2 receptor antagonist.. we have reported that in
unanaesthetised rats with a single compound 48r80
injection, neutrophil infiltration into the gastric mucosal tissue increases with the development of gastric mucosal lesions w14x. we have observed that
when unanaethtetised rats with a single compound
48r80 injection are pretreated with either amitriptyline, a selective inhibitor of histamine release from
mast cells w17]20x or  xxxd3443xxx , a histamine
h 1-receptor antagonist w21x, compound 48r80-induced increase in gastric mucosal myeloperoxidase
activity, an index of neutrophil infiltration w27x, is
attenuated 3 h after compound 48r80 injection at
which time gastric mucosal lesions develop, but not
at 0.5 h at which time gastric mucosal lesions appear
žunpublished data.. accordingly, these findings allow
us to assume that in unanaesthetised rats treated
once with compound 48r80, endogenous histamine
released from mast cells contributes to the development of acute gastric mucosal lesions by enhancing
neutrophil infiltration into the gastric mucosal tissue
via histamine h 1-receptor activation.
takeuchi et al. w11x have shown that in anaesthetised injected once with compound 48r80, gastric
acid secretion is stimulated and that pretreatment
with cimetidine ža histamine h 2-receptor antagonist. at a dose of 100 mg kgy1 prevents not only the
stimulation of gastric acid secretion but also the
formation of gastric mucosal lesions in the compound 48r80-treated rats, and have suggested a
permissive role of stimulated gastric acid secretion

pharmacological research, vol. 39, no. 4, 1999

in the pathogenesis of this compound 48r80induced gastric mucosal lesion. as described above,
however, the formation of gastric mucosal lesions in
unanaesthetised rats injected once with compound
48r80 was not prevented by pretreatment with either cimetidine ž100 mg kgy1 . or  xxxd2082xxx , a histamine h 2-receptor antagonist, ž2 mg kgy1 ., the
dose of which is known to inhibit gastric acid secretion in rats w28x. a similar result has been shown in
unanaesthetised rats with repeated compound 48r80
treatment w12x. in addition, it has been reported that
in unanaesthetised rats, a single compound 48r80
injection inhibits basal and histamine-stimulated
gastric acid secretion w29x. accordingly, it seems that
gastric acid plays little role in the pathogenesis of
acute gastric mucosal lesions in unanaesthetised rats
with a single compound 48r80 treatment.
in conclusion, the results obtained in the present
study indicate that in unanaesthetised rats with a
single compound 48r80 treatment, endogenous
serotonin released from mast cells causes acute gastric mucosal lesions, while endogenous histamine
released form mast cells mainly contributes to the
lesion development, and that gastric acid plays little
role in the pathogenesis of the compound 48r80induced gastric mucosal lesions.
