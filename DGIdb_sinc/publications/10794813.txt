abstract
ca2q-activated kq channels žk ca . regulate a wide variety of cellular functions by coupling intracellular ca2q concentration to
membrane potential. there are three major groups of k ca classified by their unit conductances: large žbk., intermediate žik., and small
žsk. conductance of channels.  xxxg1259xxx  is gated by combined influences of ca2q and voltage, while  xxxg1267xxx  and sk channels are gated
solely by ca2q. volatile anesthetics inhibit  xxxg1259xxx  activity by interfering with the ca2q gating mechanism. however, the effects of
anesthetics on  xxxg1267xxx  and sk channels are unknown. using cloned  xxxg1267xxx  and sk channels, hik1 and  xxxg1264xxx -3, respectively, we found that the
currents of hik1 were inhibited rapidly and reversibly by volatile anesthetics, whereas those of sk channels were not affected. the ic 50
values of the volatile anesthetics, halothane,  xxxd3197xxx ,  xxxd1993xxx , and isoflurane for hik1 inhibition were 0.69, 0.42, 1.01 and 1.03
mm, respectively, and were in the clinically used concentration range. in contrast to  xxxg1259xxx , halothane inhibition of hik1 currents
was independent of ca2q concentration, suggesting that ca2q gating mechanism is not involved. these results demonstrate that volatile
anesthetics, such as halothane,  xxxd1993xxx , isoflurane, and  xxxd3197xxx , affect bk,  xxxg1267xxx , and sk channels in distinct ways. q 2000 published

1. introduction
volatile anesthetics are among the most commonly used
drugs for clinical anesthesia. most of them are halogenated
hydrocarbons or their ethers. their structural similarity
promoted the researchers to investigate the target of these
compounds for years. although the mechanism of anesthesia still remains unclear, several ion channels are found to
be modulated by volatile anesthetics. these include naq
and ca2q channels, gaba and glutamate receptors žfor
reviews see franks and leib, 1994, 1998..

cellular functions by modulating them. for example, in a
rat hippocampal preparation, halothane,  xxxd1993xxx  žmaciver
and kendig, 1991., and isoflurane žberg-johnsen and
langemon, 1990. induce hyperpolarization in ca1 neurons by activating k ca žkrnjevic, 1991.. on the other
hand, halothane was shown to reduce afterhyperpolarization by inhibiting k ca žfujiwara et al., 1988; pearce,
1996.. in addition, ca2q-activated 86 rb influx in rat glioma
c6 cells was suppressed by halothane žtas et al., 1989..
together, volatile anesthetics seem to have divergent effects on k ca depending on preparations.
k ca consists of three subclasses. large conductance
channel žbk. is gated by combined influences of ca2q
and membrane potential, and has a large unitary conductance of 100–200 ps. small žsk. and intermediate žik.
conductance channels are gated solely by ca2q and their
unitary conductances are 2–20 and 20–85 ps, respectively.
in addition, heterogeneity in sk channels has been further
identified by cdna cloning žkohler
et al., 1996.. there¨

fore, variable effects of volatile anesthetics on k ca described above could be due to their divergent effects on
different subclasses of k ca .
 xxxg1259xxx  has been shown to be inhibited by volatile
anesthetics, halothane, and isoflurane žpancrazio et al.,
1993.. however, no study has been performed how anesthetics modulate sk and  xxxg1267xxx , partly because overlapping
sensitivity to channel blockers žishii et al., 1997a,b; vergara et al., 1998. and overlapping distribution žkohler
et
¨
al., 1996. would make the pharmacological isolation of
each channel difficult.
recently,  xxxg1264xxx ,  xxxg1988xxx , rsk3, and hik1 have been
cloned as mammalian sk žkohler
et al., 1996. and  xxxg1267xxx 
¨
žishii et al., 1997a,b. cdnas, respectively. in this investigation, to characterize how sk and  xxxg1267xxx  are modulated by
volatile anesthetics, these cloned channels were expressed
in xenopus laeõis oocytes and sensitivities of the channels
to volatile anesthetics were examined. we show that  xxxg1267xxx 
žhik1. currents are inhibited by volatile anesthetics at
clinically relevant concentrations, whereas none of the sk
subtypes are sensitive to the anesthetics. in addition, anesthetic inhibition of  xxxg1267xxx  is ca2q-independent while that of
 xxxg1259xxx  is sensitive to ca2q concentration žpancrazio
et al., 1993.. these results demonstrate that the volatile
anesthetics, such as halothane,  xxxd1993xxx , isoflurane, and
 xxxd3197xxx , modulate subclasses of k ca in distinct ways.

2. materials and methods

were linearized by appropriate restriction endnucleases and
were in vitro transcribed with sp6 rna polymerase žpromega, madison, wi, usa. in the presence of 3 mm
m7gž5x .pppž5x .g žambion, austin, tx, usa.. the capped
rna was dissolved in sterile water at ; 1 mgrml. fifty
nl of the rna solution was microinjected into an oocyte
using a microinjector žnanoject, drummond, broomall,
pa, usa..

2.3. voltage-clamp analysis
injected oocytes were incubated for 48–96 h at 188c in
modified barth’s medium ž88 mm nacl, 1 mm kcl, 2.4
mm nahco 3 , 0.3 mm cano 3 , 0.41 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 0.82
mm  xxxd2534xxx  . supplemented with 0.1 mgrml gentamicin.
prior to experiments, vitelline membrane was removed
after brief exposure to 200 mm mannitol in barth’s
medium. electrodes were pulled from thin-walled filamented glass capillaries žnarishige, tokyo, japan., and
filled with a solution containing 116 mm k-gluconate, 4
mm kcl, and 10 mm hepes ph 7.2. resistance of the
electrodes were 4–8 m v with this solution . inside-out
macropatches were excised into an intracellular solution
containing 116 mm k-gluconate, 4 mm kclk, and 10 mm
hepes ph 7.2 supplemented with  xxxg2125xxx  2 to give a ca2q
concentration of 10 mm; proportion of the calcium binding
to gluconate was calculated, using the stability constant for
ca-gluconate of 15.9 my1 . membrane patches were voltage-clamped using axoclamp2b žaxon instruments, foster city, ca, usa.. the current was low pass filtered at
10 khz, sampled at sampling frequency of 1 khz, and
stored through powerlab 4rs and analyzed using powerlab
software žad instruments, castle hill, australia.. at the
end of each experiment, 1 mm  xxxd3456xxx  žfor  xxxg1264xxx ,
 xxxg1988xxx , and rsk3. or 2 mm  xxxd1732xxx  žfor hik1. was
added to the bath to estimate the leak current and the value
was subtracted from each measured current. the leak
currents were typically between 0.05 and 0.1 na at y100
mv. in data shown in figs. 2a and 3, three or more
measurements were performed using at least two oocytes
for each experimental conditions and shown in mean " s.d.
2.4. application of anesthetics
each volatile anesthetic was delivered through an agent
specific vaporizer wfluotech, enfluratec, fortec žthese three
vaporizers are from datex-ohmeda, helsinki, finland. and
types mkii žacoma, tokyo, japan. for halothane,  xxxd1993xxx , isoflurane, and  xxxd3197xxx , respectivelyx which was
calibrated with a gas analyzer žanesthetic gas monitor 303,
atom, tokyo, japan. and was equilibrated for at least 30
min in the intracellular solution at room temperature by
bubbling. to calibrate the gas analyzer, concentrations of
equilibrated anesthetics were measured by gas chromatography žhewlett-packard 5890a, palo alto, ca, usa.. the
intracellular solution was applied to the macropatches by
the fast application method with y-tube described elsewhere žogata and tatebayashi, 1991; takano and noma,
1997.. it took 20–50 ms to completely replace the solution
surrounding the patch in application of anesthetics and

3. results
3.1. halothane reõersibly reduce currents of hik1
inside-out patches of oocytes expressing hik1 displayed
inwardly rectifying currents that were sensitive to 2 mm
 xxxd1732xxx  žfig. 1a control and ishii et al., ž1997a,b...
bath application of 1.2 mm halothane reduced both of the
outward and inward currents by 62% and 67%, respectively, in the experiment shown in fig. 1. the block was
readily reversible with wash out žfig. 1b.. to examine
time course of the inhibition, halothane was applied to the
excised membrane patch through the tip of y-tube while it
was stimulated by a 20 ms test pulse of y100 mv from a
holding potential of 0 mv every 100 ms. as shown in fig.
1c, the inward current was reduced by 61.2 " 3.2% ž n s 3.
within 200 ms after the application of halothane, and was
returned to the initial current level within 2–3 s after
termination of halothane. these results show that halothane
inhibits  xxxg1267xxx  rapidly and reversibly.

3.2. hik1 inhibition by õarious õolatile anesthetics
to clarify whether the inhibition is specific to halothane,
several widely used halogenated anesthetic agents were
also studied. as shown in fig. 2, halothane,  xxxd3197xxx ,
 xxxd1993xxx , and isoflurane all reduced  xxxg1267xxx  currents in a
concentration-dependent manner. the concentration–response curves were fitted with hill equation and the
calculated ic 50 values were 0.69 " 0.09, 1.01 " 0.09, 1.03
" 0.24 and 0.42 " 0.05 mm for halothane,  xxxd1993xxx ,
isoflurane, and  xxxd3197xxx , respectively. these values are
the clinically relevant concentrations for human anesthesia
žwrigley and jones, 1992.. the estimated hill coefficients
for halothane,  xxxd1993xxx , isoflurane, and  xxxd3197xxx  were
all close to 1 ž1.29 " 0.16, 0.90 " 0.10, 0.84 " 0.21 and
1.07 " 0.23, respectively., which is consistent with a notion that the inhibitory mechanisms of these anesthetics are
similar.

3.3. ca 2 q dependency
bk channels are inhibited by halothane, an effect that is
suppressed by high concentrations of ca2q, suggesting that
anesthetics interfere with ca2q gating mechanism of bk
channel žpancrazio et al., 1993.. to test whether anesthetics also inhibit the ca2q gating mechanism of hik1, we
examined the effect of halothane as a function of intracellular ca2q concentration. as shown in fig. 3, ca2q
activated hik1 with ec 50 of 0.37 " 0.08 mm, consistent
with the previous report žishii et al., 1997a,b.. this hik1
current was reduced by halothane at every ca2q concentration in a similar ratio up to 10 mm, demonstrating that the
inhibition is ca2q-independent. consistently, the ec 50
value in the presence of halothane was 0.41 " 0.15 mm,
and was not significantly different from the control value.

the amino acid sequence of hik1 is highly homologous
with that of the cloned sk and shows identity of 42–44%
žishii et al., 1997a,b.. this suggests that volatile anesthetics may also affect sk currents. oocytes expressing  xxxg1264xxx ,

4. discussion
4.1. differential modulation of k c a by õolatile anesthetics
our results show that a cloned k ca , hik1, was rapidly
and reversibly inhibited by widely used volatile anesthetics
including halothane,  xxxd3197xxx , isoflurane, and  xxxd1993xxx .
the inhibition was concentration-dependent. in contrast,
structurally related sk groups of k ca channels were insensitive to volatile anesthetics. the inhibition of hik1 was
not affected by cytoplasmic ca2q concentration, suggesting that ca2q gating mechanism is not involved. this is
different from the case of  xxxg1259xxx  where halothane and
isoflurane apparently inhibit the current by interacting with
ca2q gating mechanism žpancrazio et al., 1993.. these
results indicate that bk,  xxxg1267xxx , and sk channels are differentially affected by volatile anesthetics.
4.2. mechanism of inhibition of  xxxg1267xxx  with õolatile anesthetics

fig. 3. ca2q dependency. the currents of inside-out patches from
oocytes expressing hik1 were determined under various concentrations of
ca2q with or without 0.65 mm halothane. the currents were measured
while the patch was stimulated every 100 ms by 20 ms test potential of
y100 mv from holding potential of 0 mv and was normalized with
current in 100 mm ca2q without any anesthetics. mean and s.d. values
žvertical lines. are shown.

the fact that anesthetics mediated inhibition of bk
channel and  xxxg1267xxx  are different in terms of ca2q-dependency
suggests a mechanism of the inhibition. the mechanism
through which ca2q affects  xxxg1259xxx  gating has not
been clearly established yet, although aspartate rich
‘‘calcium bowl’’ domain in the intracellular c-terminal
domain has been implicated as a site of ca2q sensing
žschreiber and salkoff, 1997.. alternatively, some of the

t. namba et al.r european journal of pharmacology 395 (2000) 95–101

 xxxg1259xxx  associtaed beta-subunits might be sensitive to
ca2q and modulate the gating as well as the pharmacology
of channel. on the other hand, distinct mechanism for
ca2q gating mechanism for  xxxg1267xxx  and sk has been described.
in these channels, calmodulin binds to a structurally conserved domain in the intracellular c-terminal domain and
binding of ca2q to calmodulin transduces a conformational alteration to the channel protein resulting in channel
gating žxia et al., 1998.. therefore, it is possible that bk
channels are influenced by interaction of anesthetics with
the ca2q bowl or the beta subunits, structures not present
in  xxxg1267xxx  channel, while they interact with a domain unrelated
to the calmodulin interaction site in  xxxg1267xxx  channel. the lack
of anesthetic effects on ca2q gating in  xxxg1267xxx  channel is
consistent with the finding that volatile anesthetics do not
interfere with the interaction between ca2q and calmodulin žlevin and blanck, 1995..
volatile anesthetics inhibit  xxxg456xxx  currents with a hill coefficient around 1, suggesting
that one molecule of anesthetic interacts with the channel
which is formed by pentamer of subunits žbarann et al.,
1998.. point mutation study implicated the m2 region of a
subunit žforman et al., 1995., indicating that one anesthetic molecule interact with the channel pore. like many
kq channels,  xxxg1267xxx  channel is believed to be tetramer. as in
the case of acetylcholine receptor, hill coefficients for
hik1 were close to 1. therefore, it is likely that volatile
anesthetics may also bind to the pore of  xxxg1267xxx  channel. in
some of the neurotransmitter receptors, amino acid
residues, which are important for effects of volatile anesthetics, has been reported. these are ser in acetylcholine
receptor  xxxg220xxx  žforman et al., 1995., ser and ala in
gaba a and  xxxg904xxx   xxxg220xxx  žmihic et al.,
1997. and gly in kainate receptor žminami et al., 1998..
there are several such smaller amino acid residues also
found in the pore region of hik1, suggesting that some of
these are also important in  xxxg1267xxx  inhibition. the high degree
of sequence conservation between anesthetic-sensitive  xxxg1267xxx 
channel and insensitive sk channels provides an opportunity to delineate the regions responsible for  xxxg1267xxx  inhibition
using chimeric  xxxg1267xxx –sk channels.

ž1985. studied ca2q-dependent 86 rb efflux from human
erythrocytes and found that halothane and  xxxd1993xxx  inhibited the efflux in a concentration-dependent manner, at
concentrations higher than 0.1 mm. this result strongly
suggests that volatile anesthetics inhibit  xxxg1267xxx  channel in vivo
at similar concentrations as in the hetrologous expression
system.

4.4. anesthetic effects through inhibition of  xxxg1267xxx  channel
 xxxg1267xxx  is expressed in brain capillary endothelial cells
where its activity shunts excess kq released by neurons
into blood žrenterghem et al., 1995.. therefore, by inhibiting the  xxxg1267xxx  channel, volatile anesthetics may cause increase
in extracellular kq concentration, which may modify excitablitiy of neuronal cells. for example, excitability of
parallel fibers of rat cerebellum žmalenka et al., 1981. and
ca1 afferents of rat hipocampus žpoolos et al., 1987.
decreases by accumulation of extracellular kq more than 6
mm. although it is unlikely, this is the only mechanism of
general anesthesia, such as modulation of neuronal function, that deserves further study.
other than cns,  xxxg1267xxx  channel is expressed abundantly in
erythrocytes žchristophersen, 1991., lymphocytes žlewis,
1995 ., granulocytes žkrause and welsh, 1990 . ,
macrophages žgallin, 1989., platelets žde-silva et al.,
1997., and vascular endothelial cells žohlmann et al.,
1997.. charybdotoxin and  xxxd1732xxx ,  xxxg1267xxx  channel blockers, inhibit t cell proliferation and il-2 production žprice
et al., 1989; freedman et al., 1992; varnai et al., 1993;
jensen et al., 1999.. likewise, halothane inhibits t cell
proliferation and  xxxg1175xxx  expression žhamra and
yaksh, 1996.. chemotaxsis and phagocytosis, in which  xxxg1267xxx 
channel plays a role žvarnai et al., 1993., are transiently
impaired during and after halothane anesthesia žciepichal
and kubler, 1998.. vascular endothelium produces endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor žedhf. when
stimulated by acetylcholine or bradykinin žgarland et al.,
1995., and  xxxg1267xxx  channel has been implicated in the effects of
edhf žrapacon et al., 1996.. consistently, halothane,
isoflurane, and  xxxd3197xxx  inhibit the effects of edhf in
mesenteric artery preparations žakata et al., 1995; iranami
et al., 1997.. although the mechanisms through which
volatile anesthetics induced these functional modulation in
vivo are not fully understood, our results suggest that the
effects are mediated, at least in part, by altering  xxxg1267xxx  channel
activity.
in summary, we demonstrate here a rapid, potent, and
specific inhibitory action of volatile anesthetics, such as
halothane,  xxxd1993xxx , isoflurane, and  xxxd3197xxx , on cloned
 xxxg1267xxx , hik1, while not affecting cloned sk. in contrast to bk
channel, the mechanism of  xxxg1267xxx  inhibition does not involve
the ca2q gating machinery. the differential modification
of subclasses of k ca by volatile anesthetics may be useful
for elucidating the mechanisms of the modification as well
as understanding the pharmacological actions of anesthetics in various  xxxg1267xxx  channel, expressing cells in vivo.
