abstract a 1h nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr)
spectroscopic investigation of the evects of single doses
of four model hepatotoxins on male sprague–dawley
rats showed that hypertyrosinemia was induced by
three of the treatments (ethionine 300 mg/kg, galactosamine hydrochloride 800 mg/kg and isoniazid 400 mg/
kg) but not by the fourth (thioacetamide 200 mg/kg).
concomitant histopathological and clinical chemistry
analyses showed that hypertyrosinemia could occur
with or without substantial hepatic damage and that
substantial hepatic damage could occur without hypertyrosinemia. however, in the rats dosed with galactosamine hydrochloride, which showed highly variable
amounts of liver damage at ca. 24 h after dosing, a clear
relationship was found between the degree of hypertyrosinemia and the extent of the hepatic necrosis
induced. in line with the cause of clinically observed
type ii tyrosinemia, we consider that the critical
event in the onset of hepatotoxin-induced hypertyrosinemia is likely to be a reduction in hepatic tyrosine
aminotransferase (tat) activity. we discuss mechanisms by which tat activity could be lost with special

h nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy
of bioxuids has been successful in identifying metabolic changes associated with toxin-induced tissue
damage, especially when used in conjunction with
multivariate statistical analysis (nicholson and wilson
1989; sanins et al. 1990; sequeira et al. 1990; anthony
et al. 1994; beckwith-hall et al. 1998; nicholson et al.
1999; holmes et al. 2000; mortishire-smith et al. 2004;
bollard et al. 2005; lindon et al. 2005). most organic
molecules have characteristic 1h nmr spectroscopic
signals and a major advantage of applying the nmr
technique to biological samples is that the results
obtained are not limited by preconceptions about
which components to measure. in the conventional 1h
nmr spectrum of a bioxuid, the individual spectra of
all the detectable components are superimposed
according to their relative concentrations. thus, unexpected changes may be observed and previously
unrecognised substances may be identiwed, making
bioxuid nmr spectroscopy ideally suited to the identiwcation of new low-to-medium molecular weight biomarkers of toxicity. in practice, the 1h nmr spectra

123

202

of bioxuids such as urine and plasma are extraordinarily rich in information with a large number of components being detectable in a single experiment.
with the ultimate aim of developing methods for
rapid toxicological screening, we have been surveying
the 1h nmr-detectable changes induced in blood
plasma and urine when rats are dosed with model
hepatotoxins. generally, we wnd that each diverent
hepatotoxin treatment will induce a unique and complex set of changes in the prowle of the 1h nmrdetectable bioxuid metabolites. however, some common features may be identiwed amongst the evects of
the diverent toxins dosed. for instance, we have
recently reported several instances of hepatotoxininduced hypercreatinaemia and have demonstrated its
relationship to hypercreatinuria and to liver damage
(clayton et al. 2004). we have also attempted to
explain the cause of such creatine changes (clayton
et al. 2003).
in this report we describe the evects of four model
hepatotoxins on the concentration of nmr-detectable
tyrosine in blood plasma and we rationalise the
observed changes on the basis of known biochemical
mechanisms of toxicity. the four hepatotoxins whose
evects are described are ethionine, galactosamine, isoniazid and thioacetamide. at appropriate doses, galactosamine and thioacetamide are known to cause liver
necrosis (decker and keppler 1974; hunter et al. 1977)
whilst ethionine causes fatty liver (steatosis) (farber
1967). isoniazid is an anti-tuberculosis drug, which, on
chronic dosing, produces liver lesions in rats but does
not do so with single ip doses up to 280 mg/kg; it may
also cause nervous system damage and convulsions
(erill et al. 1977; thomas and solomonraj 1977; ebadi
et al. 1982; skakun and shmanko 1986; slivka 1989).

thioacetamide investigations being performed simultaneously using a common set of controls. blood was
sampled from each rat at ca. 24 h post-dosing. the
blood samples were taken under isoxurane anaesthesia
from the orbital sinus, collected into vials containing
lithium heparin and the plasma separated by centrifugation. immediately after the blood sampling, the rats
were euthanased, using co2 and then sampled for histopathological examination. the plasma samples were
examined both by conventional clinical chemistry and
by 1h nmr spectroscopy.
pathology
a complete necropsy was performed, the liver was
weighed and the liver and kidneys were sampled and
wxed in 10% formalin solution. representative samples
of the liver (two from each lobe) and kidneys were processed routinely in an automatic tissue processor,
embedded in parayn wax, sectioned at 4–6 m and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (he). selected
liver samples were also stained with oil red o (for
lipid) and by the periodic acid schiv method (for carbohydrates). the prepared samples were examined
microscopically.

materials and methods
animal studies
all the studies were carried out in accordance with the
relevant national requirements and local guidelines.
male sprague–dawley rats (»250 g and 7 weeks old at
the start of the study) were obtained from charles
river (france). the animals were kept in individual
metabolic cages in temperature-, humidity- and lightcontrolled conditions and were given free access to
water and to a commercial diet. hepatotoxins were
administered as a single dose with the dosages and
routes of administration as shown in table 1. in each
case, wve rats received the hepatotoxin and wve
received a control treatment with the isoniazid and

123

the following plasma parameters were measured using
an au600 multiparametric analyser (olympus): urea,
creatinine, glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides,
albumin, total protein (tp), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (alp), aspartate aminotransferase (ast),  xxxg941xxx  (alt), 5⬘-nucleotidase (5⬘-nt),
gamma-glutamyltransferase (ggt) and total bile acids
(tba). globulin was determined as tp minus albumin
and the albumin/globulin ratio (a/g) was calculated.

h nmr spectroscopy

plasma samples were prepared for nmr analysis by
mixing 150 l of plasma with 350 l of saline [0.9%
(w/v) nacl in a mixture of 10% (v/v) d2o and 90%

(v/v) h2o]. the plasma 1h nmr spectroscopic analyses were carried out at a nominal 310 k at 600 mhz
(bruker amx-600 spectrometer, bruker biospin,
rheinstetten, germany) with a standard presaturation pulse sequence (‘noesypr1d’) used to reduce the
size of the water signal. the spectra were referenced
for chemical shift () by setting the centre of the glucose h1 doublet to  5.233 (nicholson et al. 1995).
using the relative peak heights of selected tyrosine
(multiplet at ca.  6.88) and -glucose (h1 doublet at
 5.233) signals, in conjunction with the measured
clinical chemistry values for glucose, relative plasma
tyrosine concentrations were determined according to
the formula [(tyrosine peak height/-glucose peak
height)*glucose concentration]. this method assumes
that the ratio of  to  glucose anomers is constant
and checks supported this assumption. all tyrosine
values were then expressed relative to the average
value for the relevant control group. note: tyrosine
may bind to protein in blood plasma with the result
that the bound fraction is invisible to 1h nmr spectroscopy (nicholson and gartland 1989). hence, the
present data relate to the tyrosine fraction that is
nmr-detectable and factors such as reduced availability of protein-binding sites could inxuence these
values.

results
all the quoted results are for the toxin-treated groups
in comparison to same-study controls sampled at the
same time-point and, unless otherwise stated, the
quoted results refer to the whole of each toxin-treated
group.
plasma clinical chemistry and histopathology wndings
for samples taken at ca. 24 h post-dosing
a summary of the histopathological and clinical chemistry wndings is provided below for each toxin. in addition, selected clinical chemistry data are summarised in
table 2.
ethionine (300 mg/kg)
this treatment caused relatively minor changes in clinical chemistry parameters, the most notable being a
67% decrease in plasma cholesterol. in the liver, histopathological examination revealed that this treatment
caused minimal to moderate single cell necrosis but no
evidence of steatosis was found after oil red o staining. in the kidney, mild tubular vacuolation was found
to have been induced in the proximal tubules at the
 xxxd1751xxx -medullary junction.

statistical analysis
galactosamine hcl (800 mg/kg)
all statistical analyses were carried out to compare
dosed groups with same-study controls sampled at the
same time point. anova was performed on the ranktransformed data and pair-wise comparisons were then
made as appropriate. the minimum acceptable level of
signiwcance for each test was p = 0.05.

marked inter-animal variation was observed in the
extent of the toxicological response to this treatment.
in consequence, some of the clinical chemistry changes
(e.g. the changes in alt, bilirubin, tba and 5⬘-nt)
did not achieve statistical signiwcance for the group as a

h nmr spectroscopy of blood plasma samples
collected at ca. 24 h post-dosing
various toxin-related evects were observed in the
blood plasma such as altered lipoprotein prowles and
increased concentrations of creatine. however, this
report is focussed on changes in the concentration of
plasma tyrosine. using the nmr spectra in conjunction with the relevant clinical chemistry glucose values, it was possible to calculate a relative value for the
detectable plasma tyrosine concentration in each
sample from the formula [(tyrosine peak height/glucose peak height)*glucose concentration]. these
plasma tyrosine data are summarised in table 2
where the results are expressed as multiples of the relevant control mean. statistically signiwcant hypertyrosinemia was found after dosing ethionine (300 mg/
kg), after dosing galactosamine (800 mg/kg) and after
dosing isoniazid (400 mg/kg). statistically signiwcant
hypotyrosinemia was found after dosing thioacetamide (200 mg/kg). example spectra are shown in

relationships between hypertyrosinemia and hepatic
damage at ca. 24 h post-dosing
although hypertyrosinemia was induced by three of
the four hepatotoxins dosed it is clear, from inspection of table 2, that the incidence of hypertyrosinemia does not show a simple relationship to the
incidence of conventionally detected liver damage.
in particular, it is noticeable that, despite causing
substantial liver damage, thioacetamide (200 mg/kg)
did not induce detectable hypertyrosinemia and, in
fact, slight hypotyrosinemia appeared to result from
that treatment. conversely, hypertyrosinemia was
found after dosing ethionine (300 mg/kg) and after
dosing isoniazid (400 mg/kg), which caused little or
no observable liver damage. likewise, there is no
obvious relationship between the observation of
hypertyrosinemia and any particular form of liver
damage such as hepatocellular necrosis, biliary damage or fatty liver. however, galactosamine hcl
(800 mg/kg) induced a variable amount of liver damage and a variable degree of hypertyrosinemia and
there appears to be a distinct relationship between
these two evects with more liver damage occurring in
conjunction with a greater degree of hypertyrosinemia (table 3).

none of the studied hepatotoxin treatments induced a
signiwcant change in the plasma albumin level and only
galactosamine (800 mg/kg) induced a signiwcant change
in the total plasma protein level (a mean reduction of
11%). thus, neither changes in total plasma protein
level nor changes in plasma albumin level could
explain all of the observed instances of hypertyrosinemia and, in particular, there was no signiwcant change
in the level of either of those parameters after ethionine (300 mg/kg). signiwcant increases in the a/g ratio
(of 14%, 34% and 14%, respectively) were, however,
observed after the ethionine, galactosamine and thioacetamide treatments but there was no such change
after the isoniazid treatment. thus, there was no
detected change in plasma proteins that would explain
the hypertyrosinemia induced by isoniazid whilst the
results for the thioacetamide treatment show that an
increase in the a/g ratio is not necessarily associated
with hypertyrosinemia.

discussion
the quantitation of tyrosine in blood plasma or serum
has a recognised role in the clinical diagnosis of liver
dysfunction. tyrosine and phenylalanine are aromatic
amino acids (aaa) and are principally metabolised in
the liver whilst valine, leucine and isoleucine are
branched-chain amino acids (bcaa) and are mainly
metabolised by skeletal muscle (newsholme and leech
1988; azuma et al. 1989; kawamura-yasui et al. 1999).
fischer’s ratio expresses [aaa]/[bcaa] in blood
plasma or serum, where [aaa] designates the total
concentration of tyrosine and phenylalanine and
[bcaa] designates the total concentration of valine,

leucine and isoleucine. this ratio has been found to be
diagnostic of liver status with an increase in the ratio
occurring during severe hepatic insuyciency (fujikake
1981; joyeux et al. 1994–1995). the branched-chain
tyrosine ratio (btr) has also been employed where
btr expresses the ratio [bcaa]/[tyrosine] in blood
plasma or serum. the btr has been found to be a
good index of hepatic parenchymal damage in patients
with chronic liver disease, being signiwcantly decreased
in patients with cirrhosis or hepatitis relative to healthy
controls (azuma et al. 1989; kawamura-yasui et al.
1999).
as blood tyrosine is known to be raised in human
liver disease, it was not surprising to wnd, in the present
studies, that hypertyrosinemia was sometimes induced
when rats were dosed with experimental hepatotoxins.
however, by comparing the evects of the four hepatotoxins studied, it is clear that the incidence of hypertyrosinemia does not bear any simple relationship to
conventional measures of liver damage, such as plasma
alt activity and the absence of such a relationship has
led us to question the mechanism by which hepatotoxin-induced hypertyrosinemia arises. it is reported
that the levels of the bcaa and aaa in the blood are
principally controlled by metabolic processes occurring
in the muscle and liver, respectively (newsholme and
leech 1988; azuma et al. 1989; kawamura-yasui et al.
1999), and so the bcaa would seem to provide a reference point that is largely independent of liver function. apart from this, the clinical use of fischer’s ratio
and the btr seems to be mainly based on empirical
correlations with liver status. however, the experience
of the inborn errors of metabolism, tyrosinemia types
i, ii and iii, shows that a failure to catabolise tyrosine
will cause hypertyrosinemia (russo et al. 2001) and
suggests that some speciwc failure of tyrosine metabolism might also be responsible for the present instances
of hepatotoxin-induced hypertyrosinemia.
tyrosine can be metabolised via a variety of pathways in mammals. for instance, it is a precursor of
thyroxine (litwack and schmidt 1997) but is also converted via dopaquinone and other intermediates to
melanin (ito 2003). it is also required for the synthesis
of catecholamines, where in the wrst step tyrosine
hydroxylase converts tyrosine to 3, xxxd2471xxx  (dopa) (coomes 1997). however, most tyrosine not incorporated into proteins is catabolised, by a
multi-step process, to acetoacetate and fumarate and,
as fumarate is readily convertable to oxaloacetate,
which is a feedstock for gluconeogenesis, tyrosine is
both glucogenic and ketogenic (newsholme and leech
1988; coomes 1997). the wrst step in that catabolic
pathway is generally considered rate-limiting and is a

123

206

liver-based transamination that produces 4- xxxd40xxx , under the action of  xxxg2250xxx  (tat, e.c. 2.6.1.5), with concomitant
conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to glutamate (coomes
1997; shiman and gray 1998). if the hepatic activity of
tat were to become suyciently depleted the resulting
increase in hepatic tyrosine would be expected to lead
to hypertyrosinemia. therefore, potential inxuences
on the hepatic activity of tat are of particular interest
in the current context.
 xxxg2250xxx  is strongly induced by the
glucocorticoid hormone hydrocortisone, by its synthetic
analogue dexamethasone and also by glucagon and its
secondary messenger, 3⬘, 5⬘-cyclic  xxxd81xxx  (camp), which all increase the rate of transcription (evans 1981; groenewald et al.1984; schmid
et al. 1987; shelly and yeoh 1991). in view of tyrosine’s
glucogenic (and ketogenic) character, such induction is
consistent with the role of glucagon and glucocorticoids
in maintaining blood glucose. furthermore, when
blood glucose is elevated, hepatic tat activity is
decreased (nemeth 1978). in general terms, the overall
hepatic activity of tat may be reduced either by a
reduction in the total amount of tat or by a reduction
in the catalytic activity of the individual enzyme units.
a remarkable feature of hepatic tat is its unusually
short half-life (ca. 2 h) (newsholme and leech 1988),
which indicates a regulatory role and, if this half-life
were maintained, failure to rapidly resynthesize tat
would soon lead to a decrease in the amount of tat in
the liver. thus, the hepatic level of tat would be
expected to be highly sensitive to anything, such as
cycloheximide, that inhibits protein synthesis. additionally, pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate ( xxxd3047xxx ) is a required
cofactor for aminotransferases such as tat (coomes
1997) and so  xxxd3047xxx  depletion will also cause a loss of
tat activity.  xxxd3047xxx -binding also stabilises tat against
degradation, which gives  xxxd3047xxx  a dual role in maintaining
overall tat activity, but tat’s short half-life rexects
its ready dissociation from  xxxd3047xxx  (gross-mesilaty et al.
1997). there are a number of ways by which the level of
atp in the liver might avect hepatic tat activity.
atp is required for the synthesis of  xxxd3047xxx  from pyridoxal
and atp under the action of  xxxg1720xxx  (e.c.
2.7.1.35). atp is also converted to  xxxd1773xxx  by adenylate cyclase and, in addition to camp’s known role in
increasing tat transcription, it has been suggested
(hamm and seubert 1977) that tat may be activated
by camp-activated protein kinase-catalysed phosphorylation. lastly, as protein synthesis is heavily dependent on atp, atp-depletion could lead to a rapid loss
of tat through impaired tat synthesis. however, it
has been shown that tat degradation is profoundly

123

arch toxicol (2007) 81:201–210

inhibited when cellular production of atp is inhibited
(hershko and tomkins 1971) with tat degradation
following the atp-dependent ubiquitin–26s proteasome scheme (gross-mesilaty et al. 1997; hershko
2005). thus, whilst atp-depletion will indeed impair
tat synthesis it can also impair tat degradation and
the outcome of these competing inxuences on the level
of tat is somewhat less certain. in the extreme case,
where atp is completely absent, both tat synthesis
and degradation will be halted and there will be no
change in the number of tat molecules. however,
tat synthesis would be expected to have a greater
requirement for atp than tat degradation, and in
less extreme cases of atp-depletion, where some atp
is available, it seems likely that tat degradation
would be favoured over tat synthesis.
the evects of the four model hepatotoxins are now
considered sequentially with special reference to
known or expected evects on hepatic tat.
isoniazid
isoniazid is a  xxxd2396xxx  of isonicotinic acid and is both
hepato- and neuro-toxic. its hepatotoxicity has been
attributed to one of its metabolites, acetylhydrazine,
which, it is postulated, is further metabolised to an
agent that acetylates proteins (timbrell 1991). thus, it
is possible that tat is degraded by such acetylation.
more signiwcantly, it is also known that isoniazid reacts
with  xxxd3047xxx  to form a hydrazone that is a potent inhibitor
of  xxxg1720xxx  and that, in consequence,  xxxd3047xxx 
becomes depleted (timbrell 1991). depletion of  xxxd3047xxx 
would account for the unusual decrease in plasma alt
activity that was induced by isoniazid (400 mg/kg) and
it appears most likely that isoniazid-induced hypertyrosinemia arises similarly, by depletion of liver  xxxd3047xxx  leading to a loss of tat activity (waner and nyska 1991).
ethionine
ethionine is an hepato-steatogenic analogue of methionine and it is well-known that ethionine causes extensive depletion of hepatocellular atp, which is
consumed in the production of s-adenosylethionine
(sae) in a reaction that is analogous to the normal
production of s- xxxd3156xxx  (sam) (farber
1967; timbrell 1991). ethionine impairs hepatic protein synthesis and, whilst such impairment could also
result from the sae-induced ethylation of nucleic
acids, ethionine-induced depletion of atp appears to
be regarded as its major cause (timbrell 1991). assuming tat degradation proceeds as normal, such inhibition of protein synthesis would be expected to lead to a

arch toxicol (2007) 81:201–210

rapid loss of tat. consistent with such expectations,
ethionine is known to reduce basal tat activity in the
liver and also to inhibit tat induction (kroger and
gratz 1979). thus, as with isoniazid, it seems likely that
a reduction in liver tat activity is the cause of ethionine-induced hypertyrosinemia. however, in the case
of ethionine, it appears that impaired tat synthesis
may be the cause of the reduced activity.
galactosamine hcl
the metabolism of galactosamine in the liver is known
to dramatically deplete  xxxd3476xxx  glucose
(udp-glucose) and  xxxd3475xxx  (utp) within
an hour of dosing, with such depletion being a crucial
factor in regard to galactosamine toxicity (decker and
keppler 1974). resynthesis of udp-glucose from  xxxd870xxx  (ump), involving stepwise conversion of ump to udp and of udp to utp (which
then combines with glucose-1-phosphate to produce
udp-glucose and pyrophosphate) would be expected
to deplete hepatic atp and galactosamine-induced
depletion of atp has been conwrmed in isolated rat
hepatocytes (ozturk et al. 1984). galactosamine impairs
hepatic protein synthesis and, whilst, in our view, atp
depletion may also be a signiwcant factor, it has been
reported that protein synthesis is impaired by the
extensive depletion of uridine nucleotides, which
inhibits rna synthesis (timbrell 1991). thus, hepatic
synthesis of tat will be inhibited and, assuming that
tat degradation is still able to proceed normally, the
level of tat would be expected to decrease rapidly.
although, to the best of our knowledge, a galactosamine-induced decrease in overall tat activity has
not yet been observed, it is known that the inducibility
of hepatic tat is abolished by galactosamine treatment (pugge et al. 1979; kroger and gratz 1984).
thioacetamide
chronic dosing of thioacetamide (300 mg thioacetamide/l in drinking water for 4 months) produces liver
cirrhosis in rats and has been shown to cause increased
serum tyrosine and decreased liver activities of ast and
alt (fontana et al. 1996). the latter changes suggest
an evect on hepatic  xxxd3047xxx , which might potentially be
explained by  xxxd3047xxx  reacting to form an imine with the
ammonia that is released by thioacetamide metabolism
(rees et al. 1966), with such imine formation being analogous to the reaction of  xxxd3047xxx  with hydrazine. furthermore, a decrease in hepatic tat activity was observed
when rats were injected for 8 weeks with a daily 50 mg/kg
dose of thioacetamide, a treatment which produced liver

207

tumours (cascales et al. 1986). thus, it seems that acute
and chronic dosing of thioacetamide have markedly
diverent evects on tyrosine metabolism because, in the
present study, hypotyrosinemia rather than hypertyrosinemia was indicated after a single dose of thioacetamide (200 mg/kg). however, whilst the observed
hypotyrosinemia was statistically signiwcant, it is important to note that the average tyrosine decrease relative
to controls was only moderate (ca. 30%) and might perhaps even rexect a pre-existing diverence between the
treated and control groups. thus, we would not wish to
place too much signiwcance on this apparent decrease,
for which we see no clear explanation. instead, we
would prefer that this result be taken simply to show the
absence of hypertyrosinemia in this case.
in summary, whilst three compounds (isoniazid, ethionine and galactosamine) induced hypertyrosinemia in
the present studies, there is also literature evidence that
the fourth (thioacetamide) induces hypertyrosinemia
when dosed repeatedly over a considerable period.
furthermore, there is a clear association, in each case,
between the observed hypertyrosinemia and known or
expected evects on hepatic tat activity. thus, ethionine and thioacetamide are both known to reduce
hepatic tat activity (kroger and gratz 1979; cascales
et al. 1986), isoniazid is known to deplete hepatic  xxxd3047xxx 
(timbrell 1991), which is a required cofactor for tat,
and galactosamine is known to prevent tat induction
(pugge et al. 1979; kroger and gratz 1984). thus, in
each case, a reduction in overall tat activity is a likely
cause of the observed hypertyrosinemia. with isoniazid and thioacetamide,  xxxd3047xxx  depletion is either known
or indicated whilst impaired protein synthesis appears
to be the relevant factor for ethionine and galactosamine.
as the aminoacid aminotransferases show a general
dependence on  xxxd3047xxx , it might be expected that depletion of hepatic  xxxd3047xxx  would lead to changes in the blood
concentrations of several aminoacids. however, on further consideration, it can be seen that, in comparison to
other amino acids, tyrosine is particularly likely to
show an increased blood concentration following
hepatic  xxxd3047xxx  depletion. this is because tyrosine catabolism largely takes place in the liver and transamination
is the wrst step in that process. in contrast, transamination is not the wrst step in the catabolism of many other
amino acids, which permits some ‘damping’ of the
evect of transamination failure. furthermore, the
plasma levels of some amino acids are controlled by tissues other than the liver. in the case of the bcaa,
valine, leucine and isoleucine, transamination is the
wrst step in their catabolism but takes place almost
exclusively in the muscle.

123

as  xxxd3047xxx  is synthesised from pyridoxal and atp,
under the action of  xxxg1720xxx , it initially seemed
that an evect of atp depletion on plasma tyrosine levels might be mediated by  xxxd3047xxx  depletion. however,
examination of the present data does not support that
mechanism. whilst the tyrosine increase observed after
isoniazid (400 mg/kg) was within the range of the tyrosine increases caused by ethionine (300 mg/kg) and
galactosamine (800 mg/kg), only isoniazid caused a signiwcant decrease in plasma alt activity. the latter
evect is known to arise from  xxxd3047xxx  depletion and the
absence of such an evect with both ethionine and
galactosamine suggests that any decrease in tat activity was not mediated by  xxxd3047xxx  depletion in these cases.
instead, the most likely explanation for the hypertyrosinemia induced by ethionine and galactosamine would
seem to be that both compounds cause a general
impairment of protein synthesis with an unusually
rapid reduction in tat activity occurring in
consequence of its exceptionally short half-life. an
additional possibility is that, even with a wxed concentration of plasma tyrosine, inhibition of the liver-based
synthesis of plasma proteins might also lead to an
increase in the free plasma tyrosine concentration by
reducing the availability of protein binding sites. however, in our view, that is much less likely to be the
cause of the hypertyrosinemia observed in our studies
than a reduction in tat activity. for example, there
was no detected change in plasma protein levels to
account for the hypertyrosinemia induced by isoniazid
(400 mg/kg). furthermore, whilst total plasma protein
was signiwcantly reduced by galactosamine and was
anti-correlated (correlation coeycient = ¡0.65) with
plasma tyrosine, there was no signiwcant change in
either the total plasma protein level or the plasma
albumin level after ethionine (300 mg/kg). the high
degree of inter-animal variability in the hepatic damage caused by galactosamine has been previously
reported (beckwith-hall et al. 1998) and the presently
observed relationship with the degree of hypertyrosinemia (table 3) suggests a close relationship between
the damage induced and the extent to which hepatic
protein synthesis is inhibited.
in conclusion, increases in blood plasma tyrosine
concentration were observed in rats after single doses
of three of the four hepatotoxins studied and plasma
tyrosine is, therefore, a potential marker of hepatoxicity for toxicological screening. however, by comparing
the evects of the various hepatotoxins studied, it is
clear that there is no simple overall relationship
between plasma tyrosine concentration and the extent
of conventionally detected liver damage. thus, plasma
tyrosine appears to be providing some kind of insight

123

arch toxicol (2007) 81:201–210

that is not accessible to the conventional toxicological
techniques and may be a sensitive marker of potential
hepatotoxicity for some substances. reduced hepatic
tat activity would be expected to lead to increased
plasma tyrosine and the available evidence strongly
suggests that certain hepatotoxins will cause overall
reductions in hepatic tat activity, and hence hypertyrosinemia, by depleting hepatic  xxxd3047xxx  or by impairing
protein synthesis with these changes leading, respectively, to impairment of tat function and to a reduction in the number of tat molecules present.
impaired protein synthesis could arise through atp
depletion or by other means and it is assumed that,
where there is such impairment, tat’s unusually short
half-life is crucial to a rapid loss of tat activity. from
this work it seems that the measurement of tyrosine
and other amino acids in blood plasma or serum might
be usefully extended from clinical use to animal-based
hepatotoxicity studies although, for the routine quantitation of plasma amino acids in such studies, the use of
a dedicated amino acid analyser is likely to be preferable to the use of 1h nmr spectroscopy given the low
plasma levels of some of these substances and the diyculty in quantifying them by nmr. this work may also
have implications for the clinical signiwcance of the
btr and fischer’s ratio.
