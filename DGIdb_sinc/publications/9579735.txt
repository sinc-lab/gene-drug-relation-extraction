1 the binding of [3h]-p1075, a potent opener of  xxxd83xxx -(atp)-sensitive k+
channels, was studied in a crude heart membrane preparation of the rat, at 378c.
2 binding required mgatp. in the presence of an atp-regenerating system, mgatp supported [3h]p1075 binding with an ec50 value of 100 mm and a hill coecient of 1.4.
3 in saturation experiments [3h]-p1075 binding was homogeneous with a kd value of 6+1 nm and a
binding capacity (bmax) of 33+3 fmol mg71 protein.
4 upon addition of an excess of unlabelled p1075, the [3h]-p1075-receptor complex dissociated in a
mono-exponential manner with a dissociation rate constant of 0.13+0.01 min71. if a bi-molecular
association mechanism was assumed, the dependence of the association kinetics on label concentration
gave an association rate constant of 0.030+0.003 nm71 min71. from the kinetic experiments the kd
value was calculated as 4.7+0.6 nm.
5 openers of the  xxxg1253xxx  belonging to dierent structural classes inhibited speci®c
[3h]-p1075 binding in a monophasic manner to completion; an exception was minoxidil sulphate where
maximum inhibition was 68%. the potencies of the openers in this assay agree with published values
obtained in rat cardiocytes and are on average 3.5 times lower than those determined in rat aorta.
6 sulphonylureas, such as  xxxd2215xxx  and glibornuride and the sulphonylurea-related carboxylate,
az-df 265, inhibited [3h]-p1075 binding with biphasic inhibition curves. the high anity component
comprised about 60% of the curves with the ic50 value of  xxxd2215xxx  being &90 nm; anities for the
low anity component were in the mm concentration range. the ¯uorescein derivative, phloxine b,
showed a monophasic inhibition curve with an ic50 value of 6 mm, a maximum inhibition of 94% and a
hill coecient of 1.5.
7 it is concluded that binding studies with [3h]-p1075 are feasible in rat heart membranes in the
presence of mgatp and of an atp-regenerating system. the pharmacological pro®le of the [3h]-p1075
binding sites in the cardiac preparation, which probably contains sulphonylurea receptors (surs) from
cardiac myocytes (sur2a) and vascular smooth muscle cells (sur2b), diers from that expected for
sur2a and sur2b.

introduction
 xxxd83xxx  (atp)-sensitive k+ channels (katp
channels) form a class of k+ channels gated by intracellular
nucleotides, with atp acting as an inhibitor and mgadp as
an activator. these channels are modulated by synthetic drugs
such as the sulphonylureas like  xxxd2215xxx  as inhibitors and
the  xxxg1253xxx  openers as activators (ashcroft & ashcroft,
1990; quast, 1992; edwards & weston, 1993). recently, the
katp channels in several tissues have been shown to be a
complex of pore forming (a-) subunits (which belong to the
class of inwardly rectifying k+ channels) and of sulphonylurea
receptors (surs) as b-subunits (inagaki et al., 1995; 1996;
sakura et al., 1995; isomoto et al., 1996; yamada et al., 1997;
clement et al., 1997). the sur contains binding sites for
sulphonylureas and nucleotides (aguilar-bryan et al., 1995)
and confers on the complex the sensitivity for the sulphonylureas, the openers and the activating nucleotides (inagaki et al.,
1995; 1996; sakura et al., 1995; isomoto et al., 1996; aèmmaèlaè
et al., 1996; yamada et al., 1997), whereas the inhibitory
nucleotide site is localized on the a-subunit of the channel
(tucker et al., 1997).
the  xxxg1253xxx  openers are most potent in smooth
muscle and the heart (quast, 1992; edwards & weston, 1993).
however, only few binding studies with the openers have been

performed in cardiovascular preparations (bray & quast,
1992; quast et al., 1993; loèer & quast, 1997; preliminary
reports: dickinson et al., 1993; 1996; lemoine et al., 1996). by
use of the opener, [3h]-p1075, a compound structurally related
to pinacidil, and the inhibitor [3h]- xxxd2215xxx , high anity
binding sites for these compounds have been identi®ed in rings
of rat aorta. the pharmacological pro®le of these sites was
very similar to that found in functional studies in this vessel
(quast et al., 1993; loèer & quast, 1997). binding
disappeared after metabolic inhibition concomitantly with the
atp content in the preparation, suggesting that the presence
of atp was necessary for binding to occur (quast et al., 1993;
loèer & quast, 1997). further progress has been hampered
by the fact that no binding was detected in membrane fractions
prepared from several rat tissues, even after the addition of
atp (quast et al., 1993). hence, a recent preliminary report
describing binding of [3h]-p1075 to membrane preparations
from the rat brain, canine heart and rabbit skeletal muscle in
the presence of nucleoside tri- and diphosphates (dickinson et
al., 1996) was surprising. this study led us to search for
optimal conditions for [3h]-p1075 binding in rat heart
membranes and to characterize the pharmacological properties
of these binding sites. the heart was chosen since cardiac
myocytes are a rich source of katp channels (davies et al.,
1991) and heart can be homogenized more easily than vascular
tissue.

male sprague-dawley rats (200 ± 350 g) were killed by
stunning and decapitation, the hearts quickly removed and
placed in ice-cold buer containing (in mm): nacl 139, kcl 5,
mgcl2 1.2, hepes (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-ethanesulphonic acid) 5 and egta (ethylene glycol-bis-(2-aminoethylether)-n,n,n',n'-tetra-acetic acid) 1 at ph 7.4. the
atria were removed and the ventricles minced in 3 vol  xxxg71xxx  wet
weight of hypotonic buer containing hepes (10 mm),
egta (1 mm), phenylmethylsulphonyl ¯uoride (pmsf;
0.2 mm), pepstatin a (0.2 mm), leupeptin (10 mm) and soybean
 xxxd207xxx  (10 mg ml71). the material was homogenized
by three 10 s burst at 12000 rpm with a polytron homogenizer
(probe pt-da 3007/2) and the resulting homogenate passed
through a stainless steel sieve of mesh 320 mm, to remove
connective tissue and larger coronary vessels. the homogenate
was then centrifuged for 45 min at 1056g and the resulting
pellet suspended in 15 ± 20 volumes of ice-cold hepes-buer
(in mm: nacl 139, kcl 5, mgcl2 2 and hepes 20 (ph 7.4)) to
a protein concentration of &50 mg ml71 and frozen at
7808c. protein concentration was determined according to
lowry et al. (1951) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the
standard.

equilibrium binding experiments with [3h]-p1075
for saturation experiments, the membrane preparation (0.8 ±
0.9 mg ml71) was incubated with [3h]-p1075 (0.7 ± 23 nm) in a
total volume of 1.1 ml at 378c and ph 7.4 for 30 min in an
incubation buer containing (in mm): nacl 139, kcl 5,
mgcl2 25, cacl2 1.25 and hepes 20; the buer was
supplemented with creatine phosphokinase (50 u ml71),
creatine phosphate (20 mm) and na2atp (3 mm). the high
concentration of mg2+ was necessary to account for mg2+
binding of creatine phosphate (equilibrium dissociation
constant &25 mm, dawson et al., 1986). incubation was
stopped by diluting 0.3 ml aliquots (in triplicate) in 8 ml of
ice-cold quench solution (50 mm tris, 154 mm nacl, ph 7.4).
bound and free ligand were separated by rapid ®ltration under
vacuum over whatman gf/c ®lters. filters were washed
twice with 8 ml of ice-cold quench solution and counted for
3
h in the presence of 3 ml of scintillant (ultima gold;
packard). in the concentration range from 0.5 to 5 mm, [3h]p1075 was used in undiluted form; for higher concentrations it
was diluted 1 : 10 with unlabelled p1075. nonspeci®c binding
(bns) was determined in the presence of 10 mm unlabelled
p1075.
bns was proportional to the free label concentration, l, and
was ®tted to the equation, bns=a6l, where a denotes the
proportionality constant. total binding (btot) was then
analysed as the sum of speci®c and nonspeci®c binding and
was ®tted to the equation,

to estimate the values of the equilibrium dissociation constant
(kd) and the maximum concentration of binding sites (bmax,
fmol mg71 protein) by the method of least squares.
inhibition of [3h]-p1075 binding was studied in the presence
of [3h]-p1075 (1 nm) and the inhibitor (i) of interest as
described above. btot was 7.5+0.2 fmol mg71 protein (n=53)
and bns amounted to 35+1% of btot. bs in the presence of
inhibitor i was normalized to % of bs in the absence of i and

here, a1 and a2 denote the extents of inhibition at saturation
(amplitudes) of the two components and ic50,1 and ic50,2
represent the midpoints. since the label concentration,
l=1 nm, was of the same order of magnitude as the kd value
of p1075 (=6 nm), the ic50 values for the inhibitors deviated
from the respective inhibition constant ki by 17% according to
the cheng-pruso equation (tallarida, 1995). alternatively,
data were ®tted to the hill equation,

where nh is the hill coecient.

kinetic experiments
to measure the association kinetics, membranes (0.5 ±
0.6 mg ml71 ®nal concentration) were added to the incubation
buer supplemented with [3h]-p1075 (1 ± 6 nm), atp (3 mm)
and the atp-regenerating system at 378c. aliquots (500 ml)
were withdrawn at dierent time points for separation of
bound and free ligand as described above. in some cases, ph
was measured in the absence of radiolabel with a kc1/agcl
electrode connected to a ph-metre (wtw, weilheim,
germany). nonspeci®c binding, determined in the presence
of p1075 (10 mm), did not change with time. since the label
concentration (l) was in large excess over the concentrations
of binding sites the data were ®tted to a single exponential as
function of time (t),
bs  beq  1 ÿ exp ÿkapp  t with kapp  kon  l  koff

where beq denotes the concentration of the receptor-label
complex at equilibrium and kapp the apparent rate constant of
association which depends on the rate constants of association
and dissociation (kon, ko) and on the concentration of l as
indicated above (tallarida, 1995).
dissociation was initiated by addition of p1075 (10 mm) to
the receptor-label complex at equilibrium, after incubation of
the microsomal preparation with [3h]-p1075 (1 nm) at 378c
for 30 min. aliquots were then withdrawn to follow the
dissociation kinetics which were ®tted to the equation of
exponential decay,

with beq and ko de®ned as above.

calculations and statistics
results are expressed as mean+s.e.mean. fits to the
equations given in the text were performed according to the
method of least squares by use of the figp programme
(biosoft, cambridge, u.k.). errors in the parameters derived
from the ®t to a single curve were estimated by use of the
univariate approximation (draper & smith, 1981). the ®ts to
dierent binding models (one versus two components or
versus the hill equation) were compared according to the ftest (extra sum of squares principle) or by the `minimum
akaike information criterion estimation' (quast & maèhlmann, 1982). in calculations involving two mean values with
s.e., propagation of errors was taken into account according
to bevington (1969).

results
figure 1 illustrates the kinetics of [3h]-p1075 binding to rat
cardiac membranes at 378c under three dierent conditions.
since binding of [3h]-p1075 requires the presence of mm
concentrations of atp (rat aortic rings: quast et al., 1993;
membrane preparations: dickinson et al., 1996), experiments
were initially performed in the presence of 3 mm atp and
2 mm mg2+. under these conditions, binding initially
increased but started to decline after 20 min; simultaneously,
ph decreased from 7.4 to 6.5 (figure 1, condition 1). in the
presence of atp and absence of mg2+ (mg2+ free buer
containing 1 mm edta), no speci®c binding was detected (not
shown). augmentation of the buering capacity by increasing
the hepes concentration from 5 to 20 mm in the presence of
mgatp reduced the decrease in ph and improved the stability
of the binding slightly (figure 1, condition 2). the decrease in
binding and ph was tentatively attributed to a nucleotidase
activity present in the preparation; atp hydrolysis is known to
liberate one proton per molecule of atp (stryer, 1988). in the
additional presence of an atp-regenerating system (creatine
phosphokinase, 50 u ml71; creatine phosphate, 20 mm; mg2+,
25 mm), binding and ph were stable for up to 60 min (figure
1, condition 3); ph-stabilization was achieved since synthesis
of atp from adp and creatine phosphate consumes one
proton per cycle (stryer, 1988). a series of experiments (not
shown) indicated that the concentrations used for the atpregenerating system, which are similar to those employed by
gopalakrishnan et al. (1991), were optimal. hence, the
conditions of trace 3 were used in this study if not otherwise
stated.
the dependence of [3h]-p1075 binding on mgatp
concentration and ph was studied in the presence of the
atp-regenerating system. figure 2 shows that mgatp
supported [3h]-p1075 binding with a pec50 value of
4.02+0.02 and a hill coecient of 1.4+0.1. lowering ph
from 7.4 to 7.0 and 6.5 (i.e. to the steady state values reached in
conditions 1 and 2 in figure 1) did not aect speci®c [3h]p1075 binding (data not shown). additional experiments

addition of membranes to incubation buer in the presence of: (1)
3 mm na2atp, 2 mm mgcl2, 5 mm hepes; (2) 3 mm na2atp,
2 mm mgcl2, 20 mm hepes; (3) 3 mm na2atp + 25 mm mgcl2,

repeated 3 to 6 times. (a) binding kinetics (®nal [3h]-p1075
concentration 1 nm). nonspeci®c binding, determined in the presence
of 10 mm p1075, was 30 ± 35% of total binding and was independent
of time or condition. the ®t of the association kinetics in trace (3) to
an exponential function (equation 4) gave a rate constant, kapp of
0.17+0.01 min71. (b) changes in ph following addition of
membranes as measured in separate experiments under conditions
1 ± 3.

showed that binding was stable at 48c in the presence of mm
concentrations of mgatp alone (data not shown).
attempts to fractionate the crude microsomal preparation
by dierential centrifugation, according to the initial steps of
van alstyne et al. (1980) or jones et al. (1979), were not
successful; these procedures neither improved speci®c binding
of [3h]-p1075 nor clari®ed whether or not binding was
localized in mitochondrial or plasmalemmal compartments
(not shown).
figure 3 shows total and nonspeci®c binding of [3h]-p1075
to rat cardiac membranes at equilibrium as a function of the
free label concentration. speci®c binding, calculated as the
dierence between total and nonspeci®c binding, was
consistent with a single class of non-interacting sites with
kd=6.0+1.1 nm and bmax=33+3 fmol mg71 protein. the
kinetics of association and dissociation are illustrated in figure
4. association, measured at a label concentration of 1.3 nm,
was monoexponential with a rate constant, kapp, of
0.22+0.01 min71. after equilibrium was reached, dissociation
of the complex was initiated by addition of 10 mm p1075. the
dissociation kinetics again followed a single exponential with a

1398

c. loèffler-walz & u. quast

rate constant of dissociation, ko=0.12+0.01 min71. from 7
such experiments, the mean value of ko was determined to be
0.13+0.01 min71, corresponding to a half-time of the complex
of 5 min.
in further experiments the dependence of the association
kinetics on the label concentration, l, was measured in the
range of 1 to 6 nm; at higher [3h]-p1075 concentrations the
kinetics were too fast to be followed. in all cases, the
association kinetics were monoexponential (not shown). the
dependence of the rate constants, kapp on l is shown in the
inset in figure 4. in the case of a bimolecular reaction
mechanism, kapp would increase linearly with l, with the
slope of the line giving the second order rate constant, kon,
and the ordinate intercept ko (equation 4 in methods;
tallarida, 1995). from the ®t of this equation to the data,

kon was determined to be 0.030+0.003 nm71 min71 and ko
to be 0.14+0.01 min71; the quotient ko/kon then gave a kd
value of 4.7+0.6 nm, which is in good agreement with the
results of the saturation equilibrium experiments in figure 1.
figure 5 illustrates the inhibition of speci®c [3h]-p1075
binding in rat cardiac membranes by  xxxg1253xxx  modulators. of the dierent structural families of the openers
(edwards & weston, 1994) we tested p1075 and the
enantiomers of pinacidil (cyanoguanidines), levcromakalim,
rilmakalim and its antipode (benzopyrans), aprikalim (a
thioformamide), minoxidil sulphate (a pyrimidine), nicorandil
(a pyridine) and  xxxd1868xxx  (a benzothiadiazine, chemically
related to the thiazide diuretics). all openers inhibited speci®c
[3h]-p1075 binding in a monophasic manner and with a hill
slope of 1. inhibition at saturation was complete or close to
100% with the exception of minoxidil sulphate, where
maximum inhibition was only 68% (figure 5, table 1).
inhibition was stereoselective with an almost 200 fold
dierence in potency between rilmakalim and its distomer; for
the enantiomers of pinacidil the potency ratio was only 13.
the sulphonylureas  xxxd2215xxx  and glibornuride and the
 xxxd306xxx  analogue, az-df 265 (garrino & henquin, 1988)
showed ¯at inhibition curves with hill coecients of 0.57, 0.85
and 0.78 (figure 5, ®ts not illustrated). statistical analysis with
both the f-test or the akaike criterion (quast & maèhlmann,
1982) showed that for all three compounds the ®t to two
independent classes of sites (equation 2 of methods) was
signi®cantly superior. these ®ts (figure 5b) gave a high anity
component of approximately 60% of speci®c [3h]-p1075
binding; the ic50 value of high anity  xxxd2215xxx  binding
was 88+18 nm (table 1). phloxine b, a ¯uorescein derivative,
has been shown to inhibit [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding in hit
t15 insulinoma cells with ic50 values of 2 to 3 mm (de weille et

this study presents evidence for speci®c binding of katp
channel modulators in cardiac microsomes. at 378c, mm
concentrations of mgatp and an atp-regenerating system
were required to obtain stable binding, suggesting considerable
nucleotidase activity in the preparation (see also dickinson et
al., 1996). such nucleotidase activity may explain why the
earlier search for [3h]-p1075 binding in membranes from
various rat tissues was unsuccessful despite the addition of
atp to the incubation medium (quast et al., 1993). the results
show that the hydrolysis of atp abolishes binding, whereas
the accompanying change in ph (from 7.4 to 6.5) is not
important. in the presence of the atp-regenerating system and
high concentrations of mg2+, atp supported [3h]-p1075
binding in a positive cooperative manner (hill coecient 1.4)
and with an ec50 value of 100 mm. the requirement for mg2+
suggests that the nucleotide binding site which regulates
opener binding is dierent from the site which mediates
inhibition of the channel by atp; at this inhibitory site, which
is localized on the a-subunit of the channel (tucker et al., 1997)
atp and mgatp are of similar potency (nichols & lederer,
1991).

curve. the ®tting parameters are given in table 1; btot was

saturation binding experiments suggested the existence of a
homogeneous class of non-interacting binding sites for p1075
in the cardiac membrane preparation with values for kd
(6 nm) and bmax (33 fmol mg71 protein) similar to those in
intact rings of rat aorta and the rat aortic cell line, a10 (kd: 6.1
and 5.5 nm; bmax: 78 and 150 fmol mg71 protein; quast et al.,
1993; russ et al., 1997). the kinetic experiments suggested that
the association of [3h]-p1075 to its receptor followed a
bimolecular mechanism: ®rstly, the apparent rate constant
determined in the association measurements increased linearly
with the concentration of radiolabel and, secondly, the rate
constants for association and dissociation gave a kd value
similar to that obtained in the equilibrium saturation
experiments. the rate constants are in excellent agreement

with those for [3h]-p1075 binding to rat glomeruli; in the
glomerular preparation, this binding is localized on the
remnants of aerent arterioles attached to the glomeruli and
has the pharmacological properties of the vascular receptor
(metzger & quast, 1996).

evidence for heterogeneity of the [3h]-p1075 binding
sites
most openers competed with [3h]-p1075 with regular
inhibition curves extrapolating to complete inhibition at
saturation; this is compatible with a direct competition for a
homogeneous class of binding sites. however, the fact that
minoxidil sulphate only inhibited [3h]-p1075 binding by 68%
indicated heterogeneity of the opener binding sites. two
explanations are possible; either minoxidil sulphate binds to
only a fraction of the p1075 sites, or it binds to a class of site
which is dierent from, but negatively allosterically coupled to
the p1075 site. further experiments showed that minoxidil
sulphate, up to 100 mm, did not enhance the rate of
dissociation of the [3h]-p1075-receptor complex (not illustrated). this renders the negative allosteric model unlikely
and favours the possibility that the preparation contains two
classes of (non-interacting) binding site with a ratio of 2 : 1;
both classes of site have very similar anities for all openers
tested, with the exception of minoxidil sulphate which does not
bind to the second class.
heterogeneity of the p1075 sites was also evident from the
biphasic competition curves obtained with the sulphonylurea
inhibitors and with az-df 265. with [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  as
the radiolabel, heterogeneity of the  xxxd2215xxx  sites has
been found in membranes from rat heart (gopalakrishnan et
al., 1991) and in rings from rat aorta (loèer & quast, 1997).
however, inhibition of [3h]-p1075 binding by sulphonylureas
in vascular smooth muscle cells has always been found to be
monophasic, resulting in either complete (rat aorta, quast et
al., 1993) or partial inhibition (aerent arteriole: 90%
(metzger & quast, 1996); a10 cells: 75% (russ et al., 1997)).
to our knowledge, biphasic inhibition of [3h]-p1075 binding
by sulphonylureas has not previously been demonstrated. it is
intriguing that the high anity component of the sulphonylurea inhibition curves amounts to about 60% of speci®c [3h]p1075 binding. this is close to the amplitude of the minoxidil
sulphate inhibition curve (68%), thus supporting the evidence
for two classes of receptors with an approximate ratio of 2 : 1.

pharmacological characteristics of the [3h]-p1075
binding sites
the heart is a highly vascularized organ and cardiomyocytes
make up only 33% of the total number of cells in the heart, the
remaining cells being endothelial cells, pericytes, ®broblasts,
smooth muscle cells and macrophages (nag, 1980). hence it is
likely that membrane preparations from native tissue will
contain plasmalemmal contributions from these dierent cells
types (tomlins et al., 1986). it is known that cardiomyocytes,
vascular myocytes and endothelial cells are endowed with katp
channels (for review see ashcroft & ashcroft, 1990; quast,
1992; edwards & weston, 1993); in addition, a mitochondrial
 xxxg1253xxx  has been described which is activated by katp
channel openers and inhibited by  xxxd2215xxx  (paucek et al.,
1992; garlid et al., 1996; szewczyk et al., 1997). in principle,
all of these components could contribute to the observed [3h]p1075 binding. considering ®rst the pharmacological pro®le of
the  xxxg1253xxx  in rat liver mitochondria, one notes that the
potencies obtained for activation of this channel by

[3h]-p1075 binding in rat cardiac membranes

cromakalim (6.3 mm) and  xxxd1868xxx  (2.3 mm) (garlid et al.,
1996) are incompatible with the values found here in rat
cardiac membranes. similarly, it seems unlikely that the
sulphonylurea binding site present in mitochondria (paucek
et al., 1992; szewczyk et al., 1997) contributes much to the low
anity sites seen in the [3h]-p1075 binding assay, since the
mitochondrial sites, when labelled with [3h]-  xxxd2215xxx , do
not recognize the openers (szewczyk et al., 1997).
very recently, evidence for a  xxxg1253xxx  on endothelial
cells of terminal arterioles in guinea-pig heart has been
obtained; this channel is unusually sensitive to  xxxd1868xxx  (ec50
value for hyperpolarization of the cell &10 pm; langheinrich
& daut, 1997). this indicates a very high anity of  xxxd1868xxx 
for the sur from endothelial cells, which is not compatible
with the ic50 value of 22 mm obtained here. one has to
conclude that the endothelial sureceptor does not make a
signi®cant contribution to the observed [3h]-p1075 binding
and that the surs from cardiocytes and from vascular smooth
muscle cells (according to current knowledge sur2a and
sur2b, inagaki et al., 1996; isomoto et al., 1996; chutkow et
al., 1996) may be dominant.
of the ten  xxxg1253xxx  openers tested here, eight have also
been tested in binding assays in rat aortic rings (quast et al.,
1993) and in rat ventricular myoctes (lemoine et al., 1996);
these data are compiled in table 1. comparing the potencies of
the openers in cardiac membranes and in cardiomyocytes gives
an excellent correlation (r=0.96) with a correlation line which
coincides with the line of identity (not shown). comparison of
the data in cardiac membranes with those in rat aorta gives an
even better correlation (0.98). again, the correlation line has
slope of 1, although it is shifted o the line of identity by 0.55
units (not shown). this indicates that these openers are, on
average, 3.5 times more potent in rat aorta than in cardiac
membranes. hence, the limited data available suggest that the
binding described here is primarily to membranes from
ventricular myocytes. this proposal may be tested by [3h]p1075 binding assays with recombinant sur2a. however, the
potencies determined in the binding assays are more than one
order of magnitude higher than the potencies of openers in
activating the cardiac  xxxg1253xxx  at physiological atp
levels (p1075: 35 mm (xu et al., 1993); rilmakalim: 1 mm (terzic
et al., 1994; krause et al., 1995); rp 49356, the racemate of
which aprikalim is the eutomer: 400 mm (thuringer & escande,
1989)).
unfortunately, data for binding of sulphonylureas to
cardiocytes are not available. however, comparison of the
high anity component in rat cardiac membranes with the
data in rat aorta shows that the potencies of glibornuride and
az-df 265 are identical in the two preparations, whereas
 xxxd2215xxx  is four times more potent in the heart. a 160
fold potency dierence between the two tissues is found for
phloxine b, which available evidence in insulinoma cells
suggests to bind to the  xxxd2215xxx  binding site of  xxxg19xxx 
(schwanstecher et al., 1995). these dierences suggest again
that the [3h]-p1075 binding described here is not to the
vascular smooth muscle component of the cardiac preparation.
preliminary studies have suggested that, similar to rat aorta,
the high anity site for  xxxd2215xxx  in the cardiac
preparation is negatively allosterically coupled to the p1075
site (loèer-walz & quast, unpublished observations); in rat
aorta, the [3h]-p1075 binding assay underestimates the true
anity of  xxxd2215xxx  by about 25 times (bray & quast,
1992; loèer & quast, 1997). keeping this in mind, it seems
likely that the high anity site for  xxxd2215xxx  described here
(ic50 value &90 nm) corresponds to the site which mediates
the eects of  xxxd2215xxx  in cardiocytes (low nm range;

c. loè ffler-walz & u. quast

hamada et al., 1990; findlay, 1992; benz & kohlhardt, 1994;
krause et al., 1995). the potency of  xxxd2215xxx  binding in
cardiac membranes is also higher than that found with
recombinant sur2a, the putative b-subunit of the native katp
channels in cardiac and skeletal muscle; here, values of 350 and
630 nm have been obtained for  xxxd2215xxx  in 86rb+ eux
experiments and [125i]- xxxd2215xxx  binding studies, respectively (inagaki et al., 1996). this may suggest the presence of
additional, unidenti®ed surs in cardiocytes with nanomolar
anity for  xxxd2215xxx .
in conclusion, we have described here the requirements for
and the properties of high anity [3h]-p1075 binding sites in
rat cardiac membranes. the availability of a binding assay for
openers in membranes may allow one to investigate the
subcellular localization of the opener binding site, the
modulation of binding by nucleotides and ph, and the
coupling between the sites for openers and sulphonylureas.

[3h]-p1075 binding in rat cardiac membranes

1401

with regard to opener binding, the pharmacological characteristics of the [3h]-p1075 binding sites described here agree
quantitatively with published results obtained in rat cardiocytes. however, the inhibition of p1075 binding by sulphonylureas is not in agreement with the available data for sur2a.
[3h]-p1075 binding experiments with recombinant surs are
eagerly awaited to resolve these issues.

note added in proof
during revision of this manuscript, a study on [3h]-p1075 binding
to membranes from rabbit skeletal muscle was published (dickinson
et al. (1977). mol. pharmacol., 52, 473 ± 481). the results are similar
to ours.
the study was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft,
grant qu 100/2-1.
