open-angle glaucoma

calcium channel blockers (ccbs), which alter the intracellular calcium concentration by modifying
calcium ﬂux across cell membranes and affect various intracellular signaling processes, have been long
and widely used to treat essential hypertension and certain types of cardiac diseases such as angina
pectoris. among ﬁve subtypes of calcium channels, only speciﬁc agents for l-type calcium channels have
been used as therapeutics. animal experiments have indicated that topical application of ccbs, especially
verapamil, caused signiﬁcant intraocular pressure (iop) reductions, while ocular hypotensive effects in
humans were not substantial. although the results obtained for nifedipine and  xxxd2728xxx  were not
always consistent, ccbs generally dilate isolated ocular vessels and increase ocular blood ﬂow in
experimental animals, normal humans, and patients with open-angle glaucoma (oag). several singlecentered, hospital-based, prospective studies have suggested that  xxxd2728xxx , brovincamine, and  xxxd2726xxx  had beneﬁcial effects on visual function not only in normal humans but also in patients with
oag, while the results of population-based and case-controlled studies were not always consistent with
those obtained in hospital-based studies. in vitro studies showed that ccbs exerted neuroprotective
effects on neurons undergoing apoptosis and necrosis. although the neuroprotective effects of ccbs have
been well documented in experimental cerebral ischemia models, no controlled studies have shown the
clinical efﬁcacy of ccbs in stroke or cerebral ischemia. neuroprotective effects also were documented in
retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors in experimental animals. some ophthalmic beta-adrenoceptor
antagonists, especially betaxolol, interact with l-type calcium channels and show calcium channelblocking activity, which may be partly responsible for the neuroprotective effects of these drugs reported
in experimental animals. based on the reported ﬁndings of ccbs and that the results of clinical studies in
acute cerebral ischemia may not be directly applicable to a chronic neurodegenerative ocular disorder,
such as oag, ccbs deserve future study to investigate strategies that are additive or synergetic to ocular
hypotensive therapy for oag, especially in patients with lower iop.

1. introduction
primary open-angle glaucoma (poag) is a multifactorial optic
neuropathy associated with characteristic morphologic changes at
the optic nerve head, peripapillary retina, retinal nerve ﬁber layer,
and gradual visual ﬁeld loss. the disease prevalence varies among
races ranging between 0.5% and 10% (rudnicka et al., 2006). elevated
intraocular pressure (iop) previously was considered the cause of
poag and was part of the deﬁnition of poag but now is recognized
as a major risk factor for disease incidence and/or progression.
although reducing the iop is the evidence-based mainstream of
poag treatment (collaborative normal-tension glaucoma study
group, 1998a,b; heijl et al., 2002; leske et al., 2007; lichter et al.,
2001; the agis investigators, 2000; musch et al., 2009), evidence
indicates that high iop is not always a strong risk factor for poag
progression and that medical or surgical iop reduction does not
always halt progression, especially in patients with normal iop
(collaborative normal-tension glaucoma study group, 1998a; leske
et al., 2007; the agis investigators, 2000; drance et al., 2001). in
addition, even after trabeculectomy reduces the iop to 10 mmhg,
visual ﬁeld damage slowly but signiﬁcantly progresses (hagiwara
et al., 2000; shigeeda et al., 2002). among various presumably
iop-independent destructive factors, disrupted ocular perfusion is
probably only one factor that contributes to the poag incidence and/
or progression, which was supported by population-based or
prospective cohort studies (tielsch et al., 1995; bonomi et al., 2000;
quigley et al., 2001; leske et al., 1995, 2007, 2008).
calcium channel blockers (ccbs), drugs that alter calcium inﬂux
across cell membranes and intracellular ca2þ levels, are widely
used to treat angina pectoris, essential hypertension, and certain
arrhythmias (abernethy and schwartz, 1999). ccbs also have clinical potential for ameliorating the iop-independent destructive
processes in poag.
this review provides a brief overview of calcium channels and ltype calcium channel blockers; reviews studies that investigated the
effects of ccbs on iop, ocular blood ﬂow, visual function, neuroprotective effects of ccbs, and the calcium blocking activities of
ophthalmic b-adrenoceptor antagonists; and summarizes the
rationale behind the potential role of ccbs in the treatment of poag.
2. calcium channels: a brief overview
calcium antagonists or ccbs are a chemically, pharmacologically, and therapeutically heterogeneous group of drugs introduced

into clinical practice in the 1960s to treat cardiovascular diseases
(freher et al., 1999). calcium ions are essential for cellular
communication and regulation, in that they are ubiquitous intracellular messenger coupling membrane-mediated stimuli and
intracellular processes (carafole and klee, 1999). the intracellular
concentration of calcium ion is low, (1.1e1.3 mmol/l in plasma),
with a high inwardly directed concentration and electrochemical
gradients across the cell membrane. the pathways of cellular
calcium regulation are the naþ/ca2þ exchanger, receptor-operated
calcium channels, voltage-gated calcium channels, leak pathway,
ca2þ-activated atpase (plasmalemmal ca2þ pump at the cell
membrane), and intracellularly, mitochondrial uptake and release
sites, calcium release channels, and ca2þ-atpase in sarcoplasmic
reticulum (triggle, 2002). although speciﬁc drugs should discretely
interact with each of those sites, drugs causing pharmacologically
and therapeutically beneﬁcial effects are currently available only
for the voltage-gated calcium channels (triggle, 2002).
there are ﬁve major subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels: l-, n-, t-, p/q-, and r-types, which are distinguished by
electrophysiologic, biophysical, and pharmacologic characteristics
and tissue localization. based on the membrane potential at which
voltage-gated calcium channels are activated and inactivated, they
are divided into two classes. the low voltage-activated calcium
channels (t-type) are activated and inactivated at low membrane
potentials (>70 mv). the t-type channels are responsible for
pacemaking activities in excitable cells and for generating ca2þ
currents in cardiac and endocrine tissues (bean, 1989; catterall,
1995). this type of calcium channel is also found in retinal glial
cells (bringmann et al., 2000). the high voltage-activated calcium
channels (l-, n-, p/q-, and r-types) are activated and inactivated at
relatively high membrane potentials (>50 mv) and distinct in
tissue localization and pharmacologic activities. the l-type channels are substantially conﬁned to cardiac muscle, vascular smooth
muscle, and skeletal muscle, and the n-, p/q-, and r-type channels
to neurons (bean, 1989; westenbroek et al., 1992; miljanich and
ramachandran, 1995; catterall, 1995; ertel et al., 2000; de waard
et al., 1996; hofmann et al., 1994; endoh, 2001).
the voltage-gated calcium channels are comprised of four
subunits, a1, a2-d, b, and g. the a1 subunit is the dominant
component and expresses the pore structure and drug binding sites
(de waard et al., 1996; hofmann et al., 1994, 1999; catterall and
striessnig, 1992; hofmann and klugbauer, 2000). the a1 subunits
are coded at a minimum of 10 different genes and a number of
splice variants is known, and structural and functional differences

among the voltage-gated calcium channels (l-, n-, p/q-,t-, and
r-types) are mainly attributable to differences in the a1 subunits
(table 1) (endoh, 2001). the a1 subunit has four homologous
domains, motifs ieiv, each of which has six transmembrane
segments (s1es6) and the pore of the channel is comprised of s5
and s6 segments and a region between s5 and s6 (fig. 1a and b).
the s4 segment contains charged residues followed by several
hydrophobic residues, and this characteristic sequence may be
responsible for the voltage sensor region of the calcium channel.
the a2 subunit and d subunit are disulﬁde-linked to comprise the
a2-d subunit, which modulates the ca2þ current through the a1
subunit (endoh, 2001). the b subunit is coded by at least four
different genes and is not a membrane component, linking with the
a1 subunit through a speciﬁc sequence (de waard et al., 1994;
witcher et al., 1995; hofmann and klugbauer, 2000). the
b subunit increases expression and modiﬁes the biophysical properties of the a1 subunit, increasing current density and shifting the
voltage-dependence of the channel (triggle, 2002; gerster et al.,
1999). the g subunit is a membrane component with four transmembrane segments (endoh, 2001) (fig. 2).
functional disorders of the calcium channels, referred to as
channelopathy, associated with mutations in the a1 subunit have
been reported. for example, mutations in the a1a subunit of the
p/q-type calcium channel are associated with familial hemiplegic
migraine (kraus et al., 2000), chronic cerebellar ataxia, and episodic
ataxia (endoh, 2001), mutation in the a1f subunit of the l-type
calcium channels with incomplete x-linked congenital stationary
night blindness (strom et al., 1998; bech-hansen et al., 1998), and
mutation in the a1s subunit with hypokalemic periodic paralysis
(ptacek et al., 1994).
3. l-type calcium channel and its blockers
for the t-, n-, p/q-, and r-type calcium channels, available
speciﬁc agents are limited. for the l-type calcium channels, several
synthetic molecules, many of which can be used as therapeutic
drugs, are available as speciﬁc agents.
the l-type calcium channel ﬁrst was isolated from cardiac muscle
and exists in arteriolar and venous smooth muscle, bronchial,
genitourinary and uterine smooth muscle, endocrine cells such as
those in the pancreas, pituitary and adrenal glands, salivary and
lacrimal glands, gastric mucosa, leucocytes, or platelets (abernethy
and schwartz, 1999). the l-type calcium channel is regulated by
various agents such as the a1-adrenergic system,  xxxg99xxx , or
endothelin (nelson et al., 1988; ohya and sperelakis, 1991; goto
et al., 1989), but regulation may differ among the cell types, e.g.,
the l-type channel of cardiac muscle is activated by catecholamines
and stimuli activating  xxxg67xxx  or  xxxd1773xxx -dependent
protein kinase (reuter and scholz, 1977; kameyama et al., 1985;
tsien et al., 1972), while these stimuli have little effect or inhibit

the l-type channel in vascular and visceral smooth muscle
(droogmans et al., 1987; mitra and morad, 1985).
thus, ccbs can block the effects of phenylephrine,  xxxg99xxx ,
or  xxxg674xxx  (et-1) on vascular smooth muscle (andrawis et al.,
1992a,b; andrawis and abernethy, 1992). the l-type calcium
channel also may have a role in cellular growth and proliferation,
since calcium antagonists decrease uptake of uridine needed for
rna synthesis and incorporation of leucine at concentrations eliciting clinical effects or inhibit synthesis of extracellular matrix
collagens (schmitt et al., 1995; roth et al., 1996). for example, ccbs
can prevent atherosclerosis in experimental animals, although this
effect has not been conﬁrmed in human clinical studies (henry and
bentley, 1981; lichtlen et al., 1990; waters et al., 1990). some ccbs
inhibit attachment and proliferation of human tenon’s ﬁbroblast
with the inhibitory doses 50% (id50s) in the (104 m) range (kang
et al., 1997), although topical verapamil failed to show signiﬁcant
beneﬁt after ﬁltering surgeries (shin et al., 2001).
from the pharmacologic standpoint, ion channels, such as
voltage-gated calcium channels, may be expediently treated as
pharmacologic receptors with the following properties (triggle,
2002): speciﬁc binding sites for both agonists (activators) and
antagonists (inactivators), coupling of binding sites for permeation
and gating of the channel; regulation by endogenous and/or

exogenous inﬂuences; and alteration of expression and function in
various pathological conditions.
several ways of classifying therapeutic ccbs have been
proposed (hirata and yokoyama, 2001). however, it seems
convenient to classify them according to chemical structures
interacting at a discrete site of the l-type calcium channel and
then to subclassify them according to generation: the phenylalkylamine (paa) or verapamil-like ccbs, the benzothiazepine
(btz) or diltiazem-like ccbs, the dihydropyridine (dhp) or nifedipine-like ccbs, and the piperadine ccbs and others. three major
classes of l-type calcium channel ligand consist of the paa, btz,
and dhp ccbs. the paa ccbs bind to the transmembrane segment
of motif iv (ivs6), the btz ccbs to a cytoplasmic bridge between
motifs iii and iv, and the dhp ccbs to transmembrane segment 6
of motifs iii and iv (iiis6 and ivs6) (endoh, 2001; abernethy and
schwartz, 1999).
all paa, btz, and dhp ccbs cause vasodilatation and resultant
lowering of blood pressure, but the relative potency of the vasodilation varies, with dhp ccbs more potent than paa or btz ccbs.
dhp ccbs generally bind with some selectivity to l-type calcium
channels in vascular smooth muscle, while verapamil binds equally
well to cardiac and vascular l-type calcium channels (morel et al.,
1998; soldatov et al., 1995). in vitro, all paa, btz, and dhp
calcium antagonists depress sinus-node activity, delay atrioventricular conduction, and decrease myocardial contractility, but only
verapamil and diltiazem delay atrioventricular conduction, cause
sinus-node depression, and decrease myocardial contractility in
vivo at clinical doses. these disparities between the in vivo and in
vitro effects may be attributable to the sympathetic activation
accompanied by vasodilation induced by dhp ccbs (abernethy and
schwartz, 1999).
table 2 summarizes the pharmacologic properties of representative commercially available ccbs (abernethy and schwartz, 1999;
hirata and yokoyama, 2001).
earlier studies have suggested that treatment of hypertension
with primarily short-acting ccbs is associated with increased

57

mortality especially in patients with coronary heart disease (psaty
et al., 1995; pahor et al., 1995; furberg et al., 1995), although these
results were not always convincing (epstein, 1995; messerli, 1995).
considering the possible disadvantages of short-acting ccbs, longacting ccbs have been evaluated by several randomized controlled
trials, and the effectiveness and clinical safety of long-acting ccbs
for treating hypertension have been established (deanﬁeld et al.,
1994; the defiant-ii research group, 1997; pitt et al., 2000;
brown et al., 2000; staessen et al., 2002; packer et al., 1996; ad
hoc subcommittee of the liaison committee of the world health
organization and the international society of hypertension,
1997). however, there are differences in the pharmacokinetic,
pharmacodynamic, and therapeutic proﬁles among the long-acting
dhp ccbs, which may translate into differences in outcomes
during long-term treatment (meredith and elliott, 2004).
a retrospective study suggested that patients taking ccbs were
more likely to develop cancer than those taking beta-blockers or an
angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors; the data from the
cardiovascular health study suggested that women who were
taking ccbs had a higher risk of breast cancer (pahor et al., 1996a,b;
fitzpatrick et al., 1997). however, other studies concluded that ccbs
did not increase the risk of any cancer among patients with
hypertension (olsen et al., 1997; hole et al., 1998; rosenberg et al.,
1998), which is the current consensus of the relationship between
ccbs and cancer risk (ad hoc subcommittee of the liaison
committee of the world health organization and the
international society of hypertension, 1997).

and consequently less toxic agents to modify intracellular calcium,
such as ccbs, were tested for possible clinical use. however, the
results of earlier studies were contradictory. beatty et al. (1984)
reported that topical administration of a relatively high concentration of verapamil, diltiazem, or nifedipine caused a transient iop
increase in rabbits. sasaki (1993) also reported a transient increase
in iop in rabbits after topical  xxxd2718xxx . payne et al. (1990)
reported no signiﬁcant effects of topical verapamil, diltiazem, or
nifedipine on the iop in rabbits, while abelson et al. (1988) and
goyal et al. (1989) found that topical verapamil caused a signiﬁcant
iop reduction in humans with ocular hypertension. regarding the
effect of systemic ccbs on the iop, intravenous verapamil was
reported to lower the iop in rabbits (payne et al., 1990; green and
kim, 1977) or to increase the iop in rabbits (beatty et al., 1984); oral
verapamil showed no signiﬁcant effects on the iop in rabbits or
humans (beatty et al., 1984); oral diltiazem showed no signiﬁcant
effects on iop in rabbits (payne et al., 1990); and intravenous or oral
administration of nifedipine showed no signiﬁcant effects in rabbits
or normal humans (payne et al., 1990; kelly and walley, 1988),
while oral  xxxd2737xxx  caused some reduction in iop in humans
with hypertension (monica et al., 1983).
4.1.2. later studies (1993 to present)
most later studies agreed that ccbs such as topical verapamil,
diltiazem, nifedipine, or ﬂunarizine caused an iop reduction in
experimental animals and humans. topical diltiazem caused
a maximal iop reduction of about 2e6 mmhg lasting 2e12 h in
normal rabbits (santafé et al., 1997); in betamethasone-induced
ocular hypertensive rabbits by a maximum of about 4 mmhg
(melena et al., 1998); in water-loading induced ocular hypertensive
rabbits by a maximum of about 5 mmhg (santafé et al., 1999); and
in normal cynomolgus monkeys by a maximum of about 4 mmhg
(siegner et al., 2000). topical nifedipine reduced the iop in normal
rabbits by a maximum of 6 mmhg for 8 h (segarra et al., 1993) and
in normal cynomolgus monkeys by a maximum of about 5 mmhg
(siegner et al., 2000).
siegner et al. (2000), netland et al. (1995, 1996), abreu et al.
(1998) showed that topical verapamil reduced the iop in normal
humans and cynomolgus monkeys with beneﬁcial effects on the
retrobulbar (netland et al., 1995) or optic nerve head circulation
(netland et al., 1996) their results also agreed with the results of
experiments in normal rabbits (segarra et al., 1993; santafé et al.,
1996). the ocular hypotensive effects of verapamil in normal
humans were at most 2 mmhg, which corresponded to a 15%
reduction (netland et al., 1995, 1996; abreu et al., 1998) and that in
normal cynomolgus monkeys were 2.6 mmhg (siegner et al.,
2000); the reduction was 6 mmhg in normal rabbits (segarra
et al., 1993; santafé et al., 1996).
topical ﬂunarizine, a nonselective ccb of the l-type and t-type
calcium channels with sodium-channel-blocking activity (holmes
et al., 1984; grima et al., 1987; pauwels et al., 1991) showed good
ocular bioavailability (maltese and bucolo, 2003) and reduced the
iop in normal rabbits by a maximum of about 2e5 mmhg (maltese
and bucolo, 2003; osborne et al., 2002; campana et al., 2002), in achymotrypsin-induced ocular hypertensive rabbits by a maximum of
about 10 mmhg (campana et al., 2002), in normal cynomolgus
monkeys by a maximum of about 4 mmhg (siegner et al., 2000), and
in unilateral laser-induced ocular hypertensive cynomolgus
monkeys by a maximum of about 5 mmhg (wang et al., 2008).
however, the effect in normal dogs (about 1 mmhg) was less than in
other species (greller et al., 2008). another possible advantage of
ﬂunarizine is that topical ﬂunarizine attenuated retinal injury by
ischemia-reperfusion or intravitreal injection of n-methyl-daspartic acid (nmda), probably by reducing calcium and sodium
inﬂux into the stressed neurons (osborne et al., 2002), and oral

ﬂunarizine had beneﬁcial effects on the retrobulbar hemodynamics
in patients with normal tension glaucoma ( xxxd2741xxx ) (cellini et al., 1997).
a signiﬁcant cross-over ocular hypotensive effect on fellow
untreated eyes has been observed after topical verapamil, nifedipine,
diltiazem, ﬂunarizine, and phenylamine in normal cynomolgus
monkeys (siegner et al., 2000), after topical verapamil in humans
(abelson et al., 1988; netland et al., 1996), and after topical verapamil
and nifedipine in rabbits (segarra et al., 1993). this cross-over effect
may be attributed to the local effect of a ccb reaching the fellow
untreated eye through the systemic circulation or consensual reaction mediated by the central nervous system (cns) (gibbens, 1988).
4.2. possible mechanism of action
the mechanism of iop reduction by ccbs is not fully understood.
gap junctions probably regulated by calcium exist between the
pigmented and nonpigmented ciliary epithelium (green et al.,1985);
one hypothesis is that the ccbs may alter aqueous humor inﬂow by
interfering with the gap junctions (abelson et al., 1988). ciliary
epithelial cells had a synergistic increase in [ca2þ] by activation of
various receptors (farahbakhsh and cilluffo, 1994, 1997, 2002; xia
et al., 1997). ciliary process membranes reportedly have much
higher protein kinase c (calcium- and phospholipid-dependent
protein kinase) activity than other protein kinases (yoshimura et al.,
1989), and calcium-dependent regulation of cation transport was
reported in nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells (mito et al., 1993).
although its function may not always be evident (strauss et al.,1992),
the ciliary epithelial cells possess dhp-sensitive, voltage-activated
calcium channels (farahbakhsh et al., 1994). thus, it is possible that
ccbs affect aqueous humor inﬂow by modifying intracellular [ca2þ].
in fact, topical verapamil, diltiazem, or nifedipine reduced the iop
and outﬂow facility in rabbits, suggesting reduced aqueous humor
inﬂow (santafé et al., 1997; segarra et al., 1993). however, ﬂuorophotometric studies showed no signiﬁcant change in the aqueous
ﬂow rate after topical  xxxd2718xxx  in rabbits (sasaki, 1993) or after
topical ﬂunarizine in cynomolgus monkeys (wang et al., 2008).
human or bovine trabecular meshwork cells express voltageactivated l-type calcium channels that were affected by muscarinic
agonists, tyrosine kinases, or unoprostone (steinhausen et al.,
2000; wiederholt et al., 2000; thieme et al., 2005), and ﬂunarizine pretreatment inhibited et-1-induced contraction of human
trabecular meshwork cells (cellini et al., 2006), suggesting that
ccbs may affect conventional outﬂow facility. the effects of ccbs on
outﬂow facility appear to differ between rabbits and monkeys or
humans. topical verapamil (segarra et al., 1993), diltiazem (santafé
et al., 1997), and  xxxd2718xxx  (sasaki, 1993) reduced outﬂow facility
in rabbits, while verapamil increased the outﬂow facility in the
isolated and perfused anterior segment in the human eye (erickson
et al., 1995), and topical ﬂunarizine increased the outﬂow facility in
normal cynomolgus monkey eyes (wang et al., 2008). topical
verapamil also decreased episcleral venous pressure in normal
humans (abreu et al., 1998).
5. calcium channel blockers and ocular blood ﬂow
5.1. effect on isolated vessels
as mentioned previously, the primary effect of a ccb is inhibition of intracellular ca2þ inﬂux, leading to relaxation of vascular
smooth muscle and consequent increased blood ﬂow in various
organs (abernethy and schwartz, 1999; braunvald, 1982). several
investigators reported that ccbs relax isolated retinal or ciliary
arteries.
a dhp ccb,  xxxd2737xxx , and a verapamil-derivative ccb,  xxxd600xxx ,
relaxed isolated calf retinal arteries precontracted with

m. araie, c. mayama / progress in retinal and eye research 30 (2011) 54e71

prostaglandin f2a or high potassium solution in a dose-dependent
manner (nielsen and nyborg, 1989).  xxxd2737xxx  relaxed et-1induced contraction of isolated bovine retinal arteries (nyborg et al.,
1991), and  xxxd2728xxx , verapamil, and diltiazem relaxed et-1induced contraction of isolated human or porcine retinal arteries in
a dose-dependent manner (yu et al., 1997, 1998). further, diltiazem
and verapamil counteracted sustained a1-adrenergic contraction of
the isolated feline ophthalmociliary artery (yu et al., 1992). nifedipine, lacidipine, and amlodipine relaxed et-1-induced contraction
of porcine ciliary arteries, but did not affect endothelium-dependent relaxation by bradykinin or endothelium-independent relaxation by nitroprusside (meyer et al., 1995; lang et al., 1997).
magnesium, “nature’s physiologic calcium blocker” (iseri and
french, 1984), elicited similar effects from synthesized ccbs on
isolated porcine ciliary arteries. magnesium relaxed et-1-induced
contraction of isolated porcine arteries and had no signiﬁcant effect
on bradykinin-induced relaxations (dettmann et al., 1998).

5.2. effect in experimental animals and humans
5.2.1. nifedipine
gasser and flammer (1987), gasser et al. (1990), flammer et al.
(2002) ﬁrst proposed that peripheral vasospasm is a factor
contributing to development of  xxxd2741xxx  and reported that oral nifedipine could shorten the time of manifold blood ﬂow cessation in
a nailfold-capillaroscopic local cooling test in subjects with a vasospastic reaction (gasser and flammer, 1987). however, the
following reports on the effect of oral nifedipine on the ocular
circulation failed to yield consistent results. three-month oral
nifedipine (40 mg/day) in patients with oag failed to have
a signiﬁcant effect on fundus pulsation amplitude (rainer et al.,
2001), 3-week to 6-month oral nifedipine (30e60 mg/day) had
no signiﬁcant effect on the retrobulbar hemodynamics measured
by color doppler imaging (cdi) in patients with oag or  xxxd2741xxx 
(wilson et al., 1997; harris et al., 1997; geyer et al., 1996), while
sublingual nifedipine had a beneﬁcial effect on the retrobulbar
dynamics in normal subjects (goebel and lieb, 1995), and oral
administration of nifedipine administered up to 3 months
(60 mg/day) signiﬁcantly increased ocular pulse amplitude in
patients with  xxxd2741xxx  with a vasospastic reaction (schmidt et al., 1996,
1997). the effectiveness of nifedipine for increasing the ocular
pulse amplitude only in subjects with a vasospastic reaction
(schmidt et al., 1996, 1997) may agree with the ﬁnding that oral
nifedipine at a dose of 5 mg did not increase the optic nerve head
(onh) circulation measured by scanning laser doppler ﬂowmetry
(sldf) but counteracted intravenously perfused et-1-caused
reduction in the fundus pulsation amplitude and onh circulation in
normal subjects (strenn et al., 1998).
5.2.2.  xxxd2718xxx 
 xxxd2718xxx , a ﬁrst-generation dhp ccb, increased the regional
cerebral blood ﬂow with 100 times more potency than papaverine
(handa et al., 1975; oishi et al., 1978; takenaka and handa, 1979;
hof, 1983), suggesting that  xxxd2718xxx  has more potential than
nifedipine to affect blood ﬂow in the tissues affected by glaucoma
such as the retina and onh. in fact, intravenous  xxxd2718xxx 
reportedly relaxed rabbit retinal arterioles as observed by intravitreal microscopy (kohzuka, 1984), increased the feline onh
circulation measured by ldf, but not the retinal blood ﬂow (rbf)
measured by laser doppler velocimetry (ldv) (harino et al., 1992).
we found that  xxxd2718xxx  increased blood velocity in the choroids
and retina but not in the onh measured by laser speckle method in
rabbits (tamaki et al., 1996a,b). in normal subjects, one dose of
40 mg of oral  xxxd2718xxx  increased the blood velocity in the

59

ophthalmic artery measured by cdi with little effect on the resistance index (ri) (yatsuka et al., 1998).
5.2.3. verapamil
a case report suggested that oral verapamil (120 mg/day)
signiﬁcantly increased ocular blood ﬂow in a patient with oag and
the ocular ischemic syndrome (winterkorn and beckman, 1995).
one dose of topical verapamil (0.063e0.25%) increased the onh
blood ﬂow measured by ldf (netland et al., 1996) or improved the
retrobulbar circulation measured by cdi (reduced the ri of the
central retinal artery) in normal subjects with a concomitant
reduction of iop (netland et al., 1995).
5.2.4.  xxxd2728xxx 
 xxxd2728xxx  is a dhp ccb with high lipid solubility and
permeability across the blood-brain barrier (scriabine and van den
kerckhoff, 1988; van den kerckhoff and drewes, 1985) and a relative selectivity for cerebral vessels (kazda and towart, 1982; allen
et al., 1983; scriabine et al., 1989; wadworth and mctavish, 1992),
which may suggest that this drug is a ccb for ophthalmic use.
however, the reported effects of  xxxd2728xxx  on ocular blood ﬂow
are conﬂicting. two capsules of  xxxd2728xxx  (60 mg) had little
effect on the macular blood ﬂow measured by the blue ﬁeld
entoptic stimulation technique in patients with  xxxd2741xxx  (piltz et al.,
1998), and a total dose of 150 mg of  xxxd2728xxx  twice daily for
3 days had little effect on the pulsatile ocular blood ﬂow and the
onh blood ﬂow measured by ldf in normal humans (boehm et al.,
2003). however, others reported that one oral dose of  xxxd2728xxx 
(30 mg) increased the retinal capillary blood ﬂow measured by
sldf in patients with  xxxd2741xxx  with vasospastic activity (michalk et al.,
2004), two tablets (60 mg) of  xxxd2728xxx  increased the onh and
choroidal blood ﬂow (cbf) measured by ldf and ocular fundus
pulsation amplitude in  xxxd2741xxx  patients with  xxxd2741xxx  (luksch et al.,
2005), and  xxxd2728xxx  three times daily for 5 days (90  5 mg)
increased the retinal capillary blood ﬂow measured by sldf in
healthy subjects (michelson et al., 2006).
5.2.5.  xxxd2726xxx 
 xxxd2726xxx , a second-generation dhp ccbs used to treat
systemic hypertension (ohtsuka et al., 1983, 1988a,b), may be
suitable for ocular use, since this drug increased the vertebral blood
ﬂow more effectively than nifedipine or  xxxd2718xxx  (ohtsuka et al.,
1983) and oral  xxxd2726xxx  increased the cerebral blood ﬂow more
effectively than oral nifedipine in elderly patients with systemic
hypertensive and this effect was evident at a dose that had little
effect on the systemic blood pressure (shimamoto and shimamoto,
1995). further,  xxxd2726xxx  is a ccb with high lipid solubility, which
should be advantageous for reaching the ocular neural tissues such
as the retina or onh (ohtsuka et al., 1988b). we reported that
intravenous  xxxd2726xxx  increased the retinal, choroidal, and onh
blood ﬂow measured by the laser speckle method or the hydrogen
gas clearance method in rabbits (tomita et al., 1999b; shimazawa
et al., 1999), which was conﬁrmed by others (hara et al., 2004;
toriu et al., 2001). intravenous  xxxd2726xxx  also inhibited intravitreal et-1-induced hypoperfusion of the ohn in rabbits (hara
et al., 2004; toriu et al., 2001).
two- to four-week use of twice-daily oral  xxxd2726xxx  (4 mg/day)
improved the retrobulbar hemodynamics with reduction of the ri of
the central retinal artery or short posterior ciliary arteries measured
by cdi in patients with  xxxd2741xxx  with only a slight effect on the systemic
blood pressure (yamamoto et al., 1998; niwa et al., 2000; tomita
et al., 1999a), and this effect can be predicted by carbon dioxide
inhalation in these patients (niwa et al., 2000). we ﬁrst reported that
12-week administration of twice-daily oral  xxxd2726xxx  (4 mg/day)
also increased the onh blood velocity measured by the laser speckle

60

m. araie, c. mayama / progress in retinal and eye research 30 (2011) 54e71

method in patients with  xxxd2741xxx  over the study period with little effect
on the systemic blood pressure (tomita et al., 1999b). the results of
these earlier studies were conﬁrmed by our recent placebocontrolled study that showed that 3-year treatment of patients with
 xxxd2741xxx  with oral  xxxd2726xxx  twice daily (4 mg/day) resulted in
a 30e40% increase in the onh and choroidal blood velocity
measured by the laser speckle method with little effect on the blood
pressure or heart rate (koseki et al., 2008). it is well known that the
blood ﬂow in the retina and onh is stable despite certain changes in
the iop or ocular perfusion pressure (opp) (deﬁned as the mean
blood pressure e iop). our rabbit study found that  xxxd2726xxx 
increased the baseline blood ﬂow in the onh, but impaired the
recovery response in the onh blood ﬂow after an acute increase in
the iop (decreased opp) (takayama et al., 2003). thus, use of  xxxd2726xxx  in patients with glaucoma may increase the onh blood
ﬂow but weaken the autoregulatory response of the onh blood ﬂow
against an acute iop increase at the same time.
5.2.6. lomerizine
lomerizine is a piperazine derivative ccb developed for
potential use for migraine but not for systemic hypertension (hara
et al., 1995). animal studies showed that systemic lomerizine
increased the cerebral blood ﬂow in cats and rats and the vertebral
blood ﬂow in dogs largely without affecting the systemic blood
pressure or heart rate (hara et al., 1999; kanazawa et al., 1986).
intravenous lomerizine increased the onh blood ﬂow measured by
the hydrogen gas clearance method and blood ﬂow through the
long ciliary artery measured with ldf in rabbits (hara et al., 2004;
toriu et al., 2001). intravenous lomerizine also inhibited hypoperfusion of the onh caused by intravitreal et-1 (hara et al., 2004;
toriu et al., 2001). however, our study indicated that the effect of
lomerizine on ocular blood ﬂow was more speciﬁc to the ocular
neural tissues than the uveal tissues. intravenous lomerizine
increased the rbf measured by the microsphere method more
evidently than the onh blood ﬂow measured by the hydrogen gas
clearance method, while it had little effect on the blood ﬂow in the
choroids or iris-ciliary body (microsphere method) in rabbits
(tamaki et al., 2003). we also conﬁrmed that these ﬁndings in
rabbits were applicable to normal humans. a laser speckle method
study in humans showed that a 5-mg dose of oral lomerizine had
little effect on the cbf in the macular region but caused a small but
signiﬁcant increase in the onh blood ﬂow (tamaki et al., 2003).
5.2.7. other calcium channel blockers
in addition to nifedipine,  xxxd2718xxx , verapamil,  xxxd2728xxx ,
 xxxd2726xxx , and lomerizine, several ccbs have been studied for
their possible effects on the ocular blood ﬂow.  xxxd1704xxx  and
ﬂunarizine, piperazine derivative ccbs, may counteract the retinal
vasculopathy determined by ﬂuorescein angiography (nihard,
1982), and 3-month daily oral ﬂunarizine (5 mg/day) improved
blood ﬂow through the ophthalmic artery and posterior ciliary
arteries (increased peak systolic velocity and reduced purcelot’s
index measured by cdi) in patients with  xxxd2741xxx  (cellini et al., 1997).
 xxxd2092xxx  is a dhp ccb with high lipid solubility and vascular
selectivity that caused a prominent increase in cerebral blood ﬂow
in dogs (bjorkman et al., 1991; tanaka et al., 1990). however, one
dose of oral  xxxd2092xxx  (5 mg/day) had no signiﬁcant effect on the
retinal, choroidal, or onh blood ﬂow measured by ldv or ldf in
healthy subjects (schocket et al., 1999).
pranidipine, a dhp ccb, increased the cerebral blood ﬂow more
than  xxxd2718xxx  or  xxxd2728xxx  and had a longer action of duration
than nifedipine or  xxxd2718xxx  (nakayama et al., 1990, 1991). we
found that intravenous pranidipine increased the retinal, choroidal,
and onh blood ﬂow measured by the laser speckle method (tamaki
et al., 1999), which agreed with the ﬁnding that the onh blood ﬂow

measured by hydrogen gas clearance method increased in rabbits
(hara et al., 2004). semotiadil is a benzothiazine with high lipid
solubility and notable binding activity to a calcium channel site in
the canine cerebral artery (nishimura et al., 1990; nakayama et al.,
1992). we also found that intravenous semotiadil increased the rbf
but not the onh blood ﬂow measured by the laser speckle method
in rabbits (tomita et al., 2000). these effects of semotiadil on the
retinal and onh circulation in rabbits (retina > onh) are similar to
our previous ﬁndings with lomerizine (tamaki et al., 2003).
iganidipine is a highly water-soluble dhp ccb suitable for
preparation as an ophthalmic solution (kanda et al., 1995;
takahashi et al., 1994). topical iganidipine inhibited intravitreal
et-1-induced constriction of retinal vessels or reduced the onh
blood ﬂow in rabbits and increased the onh blood ﬂow in rabbits
and cynomolgus monkeys measured by the laser speckle method
presumably by penetrating to the ipsilateral retrobulbar space (ishii
et al., 2003, 2004; waki et al., 2001).
magnesium, a divalent ion, is an important regulator of enzymes
and transporters and exerts pharmacologic effects on a number of
plasma membrane ion channels (iseri and french, 1984; aomine
et al., 1999; po et al., 1999; murphy, 2000). of particular interest
is that magnesium can act as a functional calcium channel blocker
in a number of situations (aomine et al., 1999; campbell, 2000) and
has been prescribed to treat arrhythmias (campbell, 2000) and
toxemia of pregnancy (sadeh, 1989). oral magnesium therapy
(300 mg of  xxxd2531xxx ) for 1 month had no signiﬁcant effect
on the retrobulbar hemodynamics measured by cdi in patients
with  xxxd2741xxx  (aydin et al., 2010), although it improved the video
nailfold-capillaroscopic parameters in patients with oag with
vasospastic hyperreactivity (gaspar et al., 1995).
6. effects of calcium channel blockers on visual function
6.1. hospital-based prospective studies
gasser and flammer (1987, 1990), flammer et al. (1987),
guthauser et al. (1988), who suggested that the ocular circulation
and visual ﬁeld performance are affected in the vasospastic
syndrome, ﬁrst reported that nifedipine improved the visual ﬁeld
performance in patients with vasospastic tendencies and visual ﬁeld
defects neither ophthalmologically nor neurologically explainable.
kitazawa et al. (1989) treated 25 patients with  xxxd2741xxx  with oral
nifedipine (30 mg/day) for 6 months and found improved visual
ﬁelds in a subset of young patients who had a better visual ﬁeld,
lower iop, less decrease in diastolic blood pressure, and better
recovery of skin temperature with nifedipine after soaking hands in
cold water. since the cold recovery rate is an index of the rate of
recovery from vasospasm induced by exposure to cold, better cold
recovery in response to nifedipine suggests retained reactivity of the
peripheral vessels to a ccb. these ﬁndings agreed with the ﬁndings
of gasser and flammer (1987, 1990), flammer et al. (1987),
guthauser et al. (1988) and suggested that vasospasm might have
played a role at least in a subset of patients with  xxxd2741xxx  (flammer et al.,
1987). however, later studies did not always agree on the effect of
nifedipine on the visual ﬁeld. gaspar et al. (1994) reported that the
visual ﬁelds measured between 1 h and 24 h after administration of
oral nifedipine (10e20 mg/day) showed a small signiﬁcant
improvement in 59 patients with visual ﬁeld damage, some with
onh pathology, and some with normal-appearing onh, but the
beneﬁcial effect was more evident in patients with normalappearing onh than those with onh excavation. however, harris
et al. (1997) reported that 6-month treatment with oral nifedipine
(30 mg/day) in 21 patients with  xxxd2741xxx  failed to show consistent effects
on the visual ﬁeld and spatial contrast sensitivity, and rainer et al.
(2001) reported that 3-month treatment with oral nifedipine

m. araie, c. mayama / progress in retinal and eye research 30 (2011) 54e71

(40 mg/day) in 15 patients with oag had no effect on the visual ﬁeld
compared with the control group. in addition, the change rate of the
neuroretinal rim area of the onh in 10 patients with  xxxd2741xxx  treated
with oral nifedipine (5e40 mg/day) for a mean follow-up of 2.6 years
did not differ from that in the untreated group (lumme et al., 1991).
in contrast to nifedipine,  xxxd2728xxx  consistently had beneﬁcial
effects on visual function. bose et al. (1995) reported that 60 mg of
oral  xxxd2728xxx  signiﬁcantly improved spatial contrast sensitivity
measured 2 h after drug administration in 14 patients with  xxxd2741xxx  and
17 control subjects. piltz et al. (1998) also reported that 60 mg of
oral  xxxd2728xxx  signiﬁcantly improved humphrey visual ﬁeld
mean deviation and color vision in 13 patients with  xxxd2741xxx  and 13
control subjects and corrected the pattern standard deviation and
macular sensitivity in 13 patients with  xxxd2741xxx  1.5 h after drug
administration. boehm et al. (2003) later conﬁrmed those results
and reported that 2.5-day treatment with  xxxd2728xxx  (60 mg/day)
resulted in signiﬁcant improvement in contrast sensitivity in 32
healthy subjects, and luksch et al. (2005) reported that 2 h after
administration of 60 mg of oral  xxxd2728xxx , the color contrast
sensitivity signiﬁcantly improved in 14 patients with  xxxd2741xxx .
brovincamine, a relatively selective cerebral vasodilator with
a weak calcium antagonistic action, had been prescribed in japan to
improve cerebral circulation and metabolism in patients with
cerebrovascular disease (kushiku et al., 1985; katuragi et al., 1984).
two long-term prospective studies reported favorable effects of
oral brovincamine on the visual ﬁelds of patients with  xxxd2741xxx . sawada
et al. (1996) randomly allocated brovincamine (60 mg/day) or
placebo to 28 patients with  xxxd2741xxx  and followed the visual ﬁelds for
an average of 3.2 years. they found that administration of brovincamine, a better cold recovery test, and higher initial systolic
blood pressure were signiﬁcantly associated with improved visual
ﬁelds. we randomly assigned 52 patients with  xxxd2741xxx  with low-tonormal iop to brovincamine (60 mg/day) or no treatment and
tested the visual ﬁelds every 4 months for 2 years and found that
the estimated deterioration rate of humphrey visual ﬁeld mean
deviation (md) was signiﬁcantly smaller in the brovincamine group
than in the untreated group (koseki et al., 1999). further estimated
deterioration in the total deviation value was signiﬁcantly negative
at six test points, two contiguous test points in the nasal step area
and four contiguous test points in the superior arcuate area in the
untreated group, while no test points had a signiﬁcant trend in the
brovincamine group (koseki et al., 1999).
to further conﬁrm the beneﬁcial effects of a ccb on the visual
ﬁelds in patients with  xxxd2741xxx , we performed a 3-year placebocontrolled study on the effect of  xxxd2726xxx  in 33 patients with
 xxxd2741xxx  with low-to-normal iop and found that the estimated deterioration rate of md was 0.01 db/year in the  xxxd2726xxx  group
but 0.27 db/year in the placebo group, signiﬁcantly more negative
than that in the  xxxd2726xxx  group (koseki et al., 2008).
it is noteworthy that magnesium reportedly has neuroprotective
effects in rat hippocampal slices (kass et al., 1988). although oral
magnesium at a dose of 243 mg/day in 10 patients with oag for 4
week resulted in a non-signiﬁcant improvement of the visual ﬁelds
(p ¼ 0.09) (gaspar et al., 1995), another study reported that 300 mg
of oral  xxxd2531xxx  for 1 month caused a signiﬁcant
improvement of md and visual ﬁeld performance in 15 patients
with  xxxd2741xxx  (aydin et al., 2010).
the hospital-based prospective studies that evaluated the
effects of a ccb on visual function with a study period of 3 months
or longer are summarized in table 3.
6.2. hospital-based retrospective studies
one retrospective study designed to determine the treatment
effects of a ccb on the visual ﬁeld of patients with oag showed that

61

patients taking ccbs were more likely to have no glaucoma
progression (netland et al., 1993), while the other retrospective
study concluded that neither a beneﬁcial nor a detrimental effect of
ccbs on the clinical course of glaucoma was apparent (liu et al.,
1996). two retrospective studies performed to identify factors
contributing to visual ﬁeld prognosis of  xxxd2741xxx  found that use of ccbs
and the absence of disc hemorrhages were associated with less
progression of visual ﬁeld damage (ishida et al., 1998; daugeliene
et al., 1999).
6.3. population-based or case-controlled studies
in contrast to hospital-based prospective or retrospective
studies, a population-based cohort study that assessed the association between incident oag and antihypertensive medication
concluded that participants using ccbs as antihypertensive medication were more likely to develop oag (odds ratio [or] ¼ 1.8,
p ¼ 0.037), while beta-blockers were associated with a nonsigniﬁcant risk reduction (or ¼ 0.6, p ¼ 0.060) (müskens et al.,
2007). a case-controlled study using a general practitioner database of patients with glaucoma matched with controls for age and
sex also found that systemic hypertension was signiﬁcantly more
common in patients with glaucoma, and oral beta-blockers
prescribed for antihypertensive medication reduced the risk of
glaucoma (or ¼ 0.77, p < 0.0001), while oral ccbs or angiotensinconverting-enzyme inhibitors increased the risk (or ¼ 1.34 and
1.16, respectively, p < 0.0001) (langman et al., 2005). although the
reason for this apparent discrepancy between the results of the
previously mentioned prospective long-term hospital-based
studies and those of the population-based or case-controlled study
is unclear, the following may partly explain the discrepancy. as
already described,  xxxd2728xxx ,  xxxd2726xxx , or brovincamine had
little effect on blood pressure in the visual ﬁeld studies in glaucoma
cases, while oral ccbs prescribed to treat systemic hypertension
reduced blood pressure, and it is well known that lower opp (the
difference between blood pressure and iop) is a risk factor for poag
and/or  xxxd2741xxx  (araie et al., 2009). there was a difference in the
subjects between the visual ﬁeld studies and the cited populationbased or case-controlled studies. several previous studies also
suggested that cardiovascular diseases, which were the reason for
prescribing ccbs, are risk factors for poag and/or  xxxd2741xxx  (araie et al.,
2009).
6.4. possible mechanisms of action
the mechanisms of action of  xxxd2728xxx , brovincamine, or
 xxxd2726xxx  on the visual function are unclear. the reported effectiveness in subjects with vasospastic tendencies or better cold
recovery (guthauser et al., 1988; gasser and flammer, 1990;
kitazawa et al., 1989; boehm et al., 2003) or the correlation of
improved visual function and improved retrobulbar circulation
(harris et al., 1997) suggested that the vasodilating effect is at least
partly responsible for the beneﬁcial effects of ccbs on visual
function. however, lack of a signiﬁcant correlation between the
effects of  xxxd2728xxx  on visual function and ocular blood ﬂow
indexes (bose et al., 1995; piltz et al., 1998; luksch et al., 2005) and
the fact that intravenous brovincamine had no signiﬁcant effect on
the onh blood ﬂow measured by the hydrogen gas clearance
method or choroidal blood ﬂow measured by ldf in rabbits (nirei,
1996; tawara et al., 1998) suggested that factors other than vasodilation have a role.
oxidative stress may be involved in neuronal death in glaucoma
(tezel, 2006; chidlow et al., 2007), and  xxxd2726xxx  had the highest
antioxidant potency among ccbs tested (sugawara et al., 1996),

which may partly explain the effect of  xxxd2726xxx  reported by
koseki et al. (2008).
neuronal calcium homeostasis and calcium signaling are related
closely to neuronal functions such as synaptic transmission or cell
survival (wojda et al., 2008). recent studies have indicated that
calcium-dependent functional changes associated with aging take
place gradually over a long period, and various types of neurons
showed different proﬁles of age-related changes in calcium
homeostasis (toescu and verkhratski, 2007; foster, 2007). further,
the activity of l-type voltage-gated calcium channels increases
with age (murchison and grifﬁth, 2007). age-related disturbance of
calcium homeostasis does not cause neuronal death by itself but
makes neurons more vulnerable to exogenous stress (wojda et al.,
2008). thus, l-type calcium channel-blocking action itself may
retard the age-related disturbance of calcium homeostasis and thus
increase the tolerance to oag, which is a well known age-dependent disease. the site of actions of ccbs is not necessarily the ocular
neural tissues. accumulating evidence indicates that glaucomatous
damage extends to the visual pathway in the brain (lam et al.,
2003; yücel et al., 2003; ito et al., 2009; gupta et al., 2007), and
 xxxd2728xxx  affected the neuronal response in the visual cortex of
experimental animals (koch, 1998).
in vitro experiments or in vivo animal studies have shown the
neuroprotective potential of ccbs, which will be discussed in the
following section. the fact that orally administered ccbs showed
beneﬁcial effects on the retinal and/or onh circulation in humans
(see previous section) indicates that oral ccbs reached the retina
and/or onh at pharmacologic concentrations. some insults in the
in vitro experiments or in vivo animal studies may partly represent
glaucoma-related destructive processes taking place in the retinal
ganglion cells (rgcs) in eyes with glaucoma. thus, the mechanisms
of neuroprotective actions of ccbs in these basic research studies
may be related partly to improved visual function or inhibited
progression of visual ﬁeld damage in humans.

7.1. involvement of calcium in cell death pathways
sustained increases in intracellular calcium levels may be
responsible for apoptotic and necrotic cell death in many cell lines
including neurons in relation to several intracellular organelles
such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. cytosolic
ionized calcium often increases within seconds or minutes after an
injury or other cell damage and long before cell death, and the
increased calcium concentration activates varying signaling
processes including phospholipases, endonucleases, proteases, and
protein kinases (trump and berezesky, 1995; nicotera and
orrenius, 1998; leist and nicotera, 1998; sattler and tymianski,
2001) followed by both apoptotic and necrotic cell death in
neurons (nicotera et al., 1997; chen et al., 1992) including retinal
neurons (osborne et al., 2004a,b). for example, excitotoxic activation of calpain, a calcium-dependent protease, may facilitate
necrosis and apoptosis after cerebral hypoxia-induced ischemia
(blomgren et al., 2001). the excitatory neurotoxicity induced by
nmda is mediated by increased intracellular free calcium, and it
can be attenuated by preventing calcium entry or mitochondrial
calcium uptake in rat brain neurons (stout et al., 1998).
calcium inﬂux may trigger apoptosis through activation of
calcium-dependent endonucleases or modulation of signaling
pathways (trump and berezesky, 1995; whitﬁeld, 1992), and
cytoplasmic calcium has a major role as a mediator of apoptotic
pathways in early apoptosis in mitochondria and endoplasmic
reticulum (fig. 3). intracellular calcium affects membrane permeabilization of mitochondria, which has a large capacity for

m. araie, c. mayama / progress in retinal and eye research 30 (2011) 54e71

calcium uptake (nicholls and akerman, 1982; gunter et al., 1994)
and serve as important buffers for changes in cytosolic calcium
(duchen, 2000). an elevated cytoplasmic calcium concentration is
followed by calcium uptake into mitochondria, which stimulates
massive release of  xxxg569xxx  from the mitochondria. in cultured
tumor cell lines  xxxg569xxx  released from mitochondria binds to
inositol-trisphosphate receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum
membrane and promotes calcium outﬂow from the endoplasmic
reticulum, and the increased cytoplasmic calcium then triggers
a mass exodus of  xxxg569xxx  from all cellular mitochondria,
which activates the caspase and nuclease enzymes and reaches the
last part of the apoptotic pathways (boehning et al., 2003). activated caspase cascades and calpain are responsible for apoptosis in
retinal cell lines including the rgcs (das et al., 2006; saito et al.,
2005; oka et al., 2006; paquet-durand et al., 2007; nakajima
et al., 2006; mckernan et al., 2007).
to rescue neuronal cells from apoptosis, early intervention in
the apoptotic process would be expected, because irreversible
damage to the cell function has already occurred by the late stage of
apoptosis (loetscher et al., 2001). thus, it is reasonable that
inhibiting primary calcium inﬂux by ccbs should have neuroprotective effects on neurons undergoing apoptotic and necrotic
processes.
7.2. neuroprotective effects of calcium channel blockers on the retina
in glaucoma treatment, the primary targets of neuroprotective
medications are the rgss. in the neuronal cells, ischemia can lead
to excessive release of glutamate and overactivation of glutamate
receptors, and excessively released l-glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter of the cns, stimulates calcium release from
intracellular stores by exerting its actions on receptor membranes
from three ionotropic receptors of nmda, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5methyl-4-isoxazole- xxxd3029xxx , and kainic acid (siesjo and
bengtsson, 1989; choi, 1988, 1995; lipton and lobner, 1990;
schurr and rigor, 1992). ccbs potentially rescue ischemic rgcs by
restoring impaired blood ﬂow in the local ischemic tissue by
vasodilation and direct inhibition of the aforementioned calciumrelated cell death pathways including ischemia- and excitotoxicityinduced apoptosis and necrosis (osborne et al., 2004a,b). however,

vasodilation is not always equivalent to neuroprotection in tissues
with autoregulated blood ﬂow. in ischemic tissue, vasodilation
already may be at its highest and autoregulation of blood ﬂow may
be impaired (besson and bogousslavsky, 1991), while it is preserved
in other non-ischemic areas. thus, vasodilation by ccbs may result
in diversion of blood ﬂow, which worsens damage in ischemic
tissue. in fact, that  xxxd2728xxx  increased cerebral blood ﬂow when
administered before vessel occlusion (mohamed et al., 1985; herz
et al., 1996), while it did not affect cerebral blood ﬂow when
administered after vessel occlusion (herz et al., 1996; gotoh et al.,
1986; hakim, 1986; dirnagl et al., 1990). therefore, the vasodilating effect is unnecessary for ccbs when their neuroprotective
effects are expected. these ﬁndings in the brain are likely valid in
the retina or optic nerve in cases in which autoregulation of blood
ﬂow exists at least in nonpathological situations (bill and sperber,
1990; harris et al., 1998), while the effect of pathological changes
in glaucoma or other diseases, aging, atherosclerosis, or individual
variation was unclear.
ccbs with higher permeability through the blood-brain barrier
should block calcium channels in neurons more effectively
(harkany et al., 2000).  xxxd2726xxx  and nifedipine were studied
regarding retinal distribution and neuroprotection in rgcs in an
ischemia model with elevated iop in rats (uemura and mizota,
2008). the study found that intramuscularly administered  xxxd2726xxx  permeated into the retina more through the blood-retinal
barrier than nifedipine, and  xxxd2726xxx  had a signiﬁcant neuroprotective effect on apoptosis of rgcs.
pretreatment with intraperitoneal nifedipine (0.33e3.3 mg/kg)
before occlusion of the retinal vessels showed a dose-dependent
increase in recovery of the b-wave amplitude, indicating that ca2þ
overload was involved in the rat retinal ischemic damage and ccbs
provided a neuroprotective effect for the retina (crosson et al.,
1990).
lomerizine is a ccb for treating migraine that has mild hypotensive effects on blood pressure with relative selectivity to cerebral arteries (hara et al., 1995), and inhibits both l-type and t-type
calcium channels in the neurons (akaike et al., 1993). the drug had
neuroprotective effects on ischemic retinal neurons and a reperfusion model in rats both in vitro and in vivo (toriu et al., 2000). in
that study, retinal ischemia was induced by raising the iop to
130 mmhg for 45 min in rats; lomerizine and ﬂunarizine were
injected 5 min before the retinal ischemia and immediately after
reperfusion at doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg. lomerizine signiﬁcantly
reduced the retinal damage dose-dependently, and the effect was
conﬁrmed in rat cultured retinal neurons in vitro (toriu et al.,
2000). use of puriﬁed and cultured rgcs allowed us to estimate
the direct effects of drugs on rgcs excluding any confounding
factors. we investigated the neuroprotective effect of iganidipine,
 xxxd2728xxx , and lomerizine on puriﬁed rat rgcs incubated in an
atmosphere in which the oxygen levels were reduced to 5% normal
partial pressure, which increased the apoptosis of rgcs (chen et al.,
2007). all drugs signiﬁcantly increased rgc viability (yamada et al.,
2006). the contribution of apoptosis and necrosis to primary/
secondary cell death in rgcs and the effect of lomerizine on those
two pathways of cell death were studied in a partial optic nerve
injury model in rats. the rats were treated twice daily with
30 mg/kg oral lomerizine after the dorsal optic nerve was transected. secondary cell death in that model was characterized mainly
by necrotic morphology, and lomerizine exerted a neuroprotective
effect mainly on necrotic death processes at 2 weeks and there was
a much smaller effect on apoptotic cell death processes 3 weeks
after injury (fitzgerald et al., 2009).
intraperitoneal injection of ﬂunarizine (40 mg/kg) before or
after the ischemia-reperfusion injury of rat retina ameliorated
morphologic damage in the inner retinal layers including the

64

m. araie, c. mayama / progress in retinal and eye research 30 (2011) 54e71

rgcs (takahashi et al., 1992). the effect of topically instilled ﬂunarizine on the retina was studied later in a retinal ischemic
model of increased iop in rabbits. the iop was raised to
125 mmhg for 1 h and 2% ﬂunarizine was instilled topically before
and after ischemia induction for 3 days (osborne et al., 2002).
retinal damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion was evaluated as
a reduction in the b-wave amplitude of the electroretinogram,
and it was signiﬁcantly attenuated in ﬂunarizine-treated eyes. the
neuroprotective effect of ﬂunarizine also was studied in an
nmda-induced excitotoxic model in rat retina compared with
nifedipine or betaxolol. it was speculated that blockage of sodium
inﬂux and calcium inﬂux partly accounted for the neuroprotective
effect of ﬂunarizine.
diltiazem (frasson et al., 1999) and  xxxd2726xxx  (yamazaki et al.,
2002) effectively inhibited rod photoreceptors degeneration
morphologically or functionally as evaluated by electroretinography in animal models of retinitis pigmentosa. in another report,
 xxxd2726xxx  and  xxxd2718xxx  had neuroprotective effects in a murine
model of retinitis pigmentosa, while diltiazem and nifedipine did
not show such effects (takano et al., 2004).

8. ophthalmic b-adrenoceptor antagonists as calcium
channel blockers
8.1. calcium channel-blocking activity of ophthalmic

b-adrenoceptor antagonists
intravenous injection of betaxolol, a relatively selective b-1
adrenoceptor antagonist, decreased the peripheral resistance in
anesthetized dogs, while other b-adrenoceptor antagonists such as
propranolol or atenolol did not have such effects (satoh et al., 1990),
suggesting that betaxolol may act directly on the vascular bed
independent of its b-adrenoceptor antagonistic activities. however,
propranolol dose-dependently relaxed bovine retinal microarteries, while  xxxd3377xxx  only weakly relaxed them at the highest
doses (10 mm), and this effect of propranolol was not attributed to
interaction with adrenergic nerve endings or its local anesthetic
activity, whereas the mode of action of propranolol was similar to
that of verapamil (hoste et al., 1990). later experiments using isolated rat arteries (bessho et al., 1991), isolated porcine long ciliary
arteries or retinal arteries (hester et al., 1994; yu et al., 1997), isolated bovine retinal microarteries (hoste and sys, 1994), isolated
guinea-pig artery and vein (setoguchi et al., 1995), isolated human
and pig retinal arterioles (yu et al., 1998), or isolated rabbit ciliary
artery (dong et al., 2006) demonstrated the vascular-relaxing
effects of betaxolol with median effective value of about 10 mm,
which was stronger than  xxxd3377xxx  or carteolol (hester et al., 1994; yu
et al., 1997, 1998) but almost equivalent to those of propranolol
(hoste and sys, 1998). the vascular-relaxing effects of betaxolol or
other b-adrenoceptor antagonists were suggested to occur via
inhibition of ca2þ inﬂux of the cell membrane through the voltagegate calcium channels (bessho et al., 1991; hester et al., 1994; hoste
and sys, 1998; setoguchi et al., 1995; dong et al., 2006). studies
using skinned ﬁbers from canine renal arteries suggested that 1 mm
of betaxolol also decreased the ca2þ sensitivity of the contractile
system presumably by inhibiting calmodulin-dependent contractions (kitada, 1996a,b). pharmacologic evidence implied that the
mechanism of the vascular-relaxing action of betaxolol involved
l-type calcium channels (yu et al., 1999), and later biochemical
studies using rat cortical membranes showed that betaxolol interacted with the btz binding site of the l-type calcium channels
(melena et al., 1999) but was not bound to n- or p/q-type calcium
channels. in addition, the afﬁnity of betaxolol to l-type calcium
channels was higher than  xxxd3377xxx  or carteolol (melena et al., 2001).

levobetaxolol may have a similar calcium channel-blocking activity
to that of racemic betaxolol (osborne et al., 2004a,b).
as stated previously,  xxxd3377xxx , carteolol, or other b-adrenoceptor
antagonists used as ocular hypotensive agents act as vasorelaxing
agents via a mechanism similar to betaxolol but with much less
potency and thus much less clinical relevance (hoste et al., 1990;
hester et al., 1994; yu et al., 1997; melena et al., 1999, 2001;
brogiolo et al., 2002; dong et al., 2006; osborne et al., 2004a; wu
et al., 2004). however,  xxxd2467xxx , another ophthalmic b-adrenoceptor antagonist, relaxed isolated rabbit ciliary artery by
inhibiting ca2þ inﬂux through non-voltage-gated calcium channels
or by changing the ca2þ sensitivity of vascular smooth muscles over
the range of 10e300 mm (dong et al., 2007). not only betaxolol but
also  xxxd2467xxx  inhibited a  xxxd2988xxx -induced increase
of intracellular ca2þ in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells at
concentrations of 1.7 mm or higher (wu et al., 2004).

8.2. neuroprotective activities of ophthalmic of b-adrenoceptor
antagonists
considering the neuroprotective potential of calcium channel
blockers described in the former section, an ophthalmic b-adrenoceptor antagonist, especially betaxolol, not only may lower the
iop but also counteract cytotoxic damage to retinal neurons such as
rgcs through its calcium channel-blocking activity. this assumption is supported by experimental results using neuronal cells.
betaxolol (50 mm), but not propranolol or  xxxd3377xxx , reduced the high
voltage-activated calcium channel currents in isolated rgcs from
tiger salamander retina (hirooka et al., 2000); betaxolol (10 mm)
attenuated nmda-stimulated ca2þ inﬂux into the isolated rat
retina with 10 times higher potency than  xxxd3377xxx  (melena et al.,
2001); betaxolol (2e50 mm) but not  xxxd3377xxx  reduced the voltagegated ca2þ currents in rgcs from tiger salamander retina and
reduced a glutamate-induced increase of spontaneous ﬁring of
these cells (gross et al., 1999, 2000); betaxolol (78 mm) reduced
a glutamate-induced ca2þ inﬂux in the dissociated adult mouse
rgcs (zhang et al., 2003); betaxolol (1.62e162 mm) reduced the
glutamate-induced increase in intracellular ca2þ (hong et al.,
2003); betaxolol (10e100 mm) and  xxxd2623xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx  with
less potency reduced nmda-induced ca2þ inﬂux into isolated rat
retinal specimens (setoguchi et al., 1995); and betaxolol (10 mm)
reduced a glutamate-induced increase of intracellular ca2þ in intact
rat retinal specimens (baptiste et al., 2002). the effects of betaxolol
on the nmda- or glutamate-induced ca2þ ﬂux can be attributed not
only to its calcium channel-blocking effect but also its direct
interaction with nmda receptors (nagata et al., 2008). betaxolol
(10 mm) and propranolol with less potency also inhibited a kainateinduced increase in intracellular ca2þ in chick retinal cultures
(osborne et al., 1997). furthermore, betaxolol at similar concentrations as mentioned previously, and  xxxd2623xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx 
with less potency, also reduced voltage-sensitive naþ inﬂux in rgcs
(gross et al., 1999, 2000) in isolated rat retinal specimens (wood
et al., 2003) and rat cerebral cortical synaptosomes (chidlow
et al., 2000) and attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced death of
retinal neurons (arai et al., 2003).
previous studies showed that topically instilled ophthalmic
b-adrenoceptor antagonists such as betaxolol, nipradilol, and
 xxxd3377xxx  reached the posterior retina or retina-choroid by local
diffusion and systemic absorption at pharmacologically active
concentrations in rabbits (osborne et al., 1999; mizuno et al., 2001,
2009) or rats (goto et al., 2002). in fact, topically instilled betaxolol
attenuated retinal damage in rabbit or rat eyes subjected to an
ischemic insult (wood et al., 2001, 2003; osborne et al.,1999, 2004b;
cheon et al., 2002) or in rat eyes injected with intravitreal nmda or

in each experiment, a control group of isolated and puriﬁed retinal ganglion cells
(rgcs) of an identical passage was prepared simultaneously and cultured in normoxic conditions (95% air and 5% co2, 37  c). the number of rgcs after 3 days þ 12 h
culture in normoxic conditions was set at 100%. other groups of isolated and puriﬁed
rgcs were put under hypoxic stress (5% o2, 5% co2, 37  c) for 12 h after being
cultured under normoxic conditions for 3 days. betaxolol,  xxxd3377xxx , nipradilol or
carteolol was added to cultures just before rgcs were put into hypoxic conditions.
each value was mean of 8 experiments. asterisk indicates p < 0.05 versus value
obtained at 0 mm by dunnet test. this table was constructed based on the data we
previously reported (chen et al., 2007).

kainic acid (osborne et al., 1999; cheon et al., 2006). topical  xxxd2623xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx  had similar but weaker in vivo effects (wood
et al., 2003; osborne et al., 2004a). most of the effects of
ophthalmic b-adrenoceptor antagonists such as betaxolol
mimicking calcium channel blockers were encountered at relatively
high concentrations of about 10 mm. however, in our study in which
the effects of ophthalmic b-adrenoceptor antagonists on the isolated
and cultured rat rgcs were studied under hypoxic or oxidative
insult, betaxolol,  xxxd3377xxx , and nipradilol but not carteolol had
signiﬁcant neuroprotective effects at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mm,
which were much lower than those reported for their vascularrelaxing or calcium channel-blocking effects (chen et al., 2007; yu
et al., 2007). in fact, it was conﬁrmed that betaxolol,  xxxd3377xxx , or
nipradilol had little effect on the hypoxia-induced ca2þ inﬂux into
cultured rgcs at 1 mm, while  xxxd2728xxx  signiﬁcantly reduced the
ca2þ inﬂux under normoxic conditions (chen et al., 2007), suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of betaxolol,  xxxd3377xxx , or
nipradilol encountered at lower concentrations are at least attributed partly to effects other than their calcium channel-blocking
activity (tables 4a and 4b). topical betaxolol reportedly increased
expression of mrna of a  xxxg1614xxx  in rat retina (wood
et al., 2001).
it may be interesting to determine whether the neuroprotective
potential of betaxolol seen in basic research studies can be
conﬁrmed in patients with glaucoma. although earlier studies with
relatively small sample sizes (n < 50) have suggested that the
treatment effect on the visual ﬁeld was better in betaxolol-treated
than in the  xxxd3377xxx -treated patients with poag (messmer et al.,
1991; collignon-brach, 1994), later comparative studies with
larger sample sizes reported no signiﬁcant difference in the effects
of betaxolol and  xxxd3377xxx  on the visual ﬁeld (drance, 1998; watson
et al., 2001; araie et al., 2003) or in the conversion rate from
ocular hypertension to glaucoma between betaxolol- and placebotreated groups (kamal et al., 2003).

9. future directions
among various types of glaucoma, poag has the highest prevalence. poag cases with normal iop ( xxxd2741xxx ) account for between
30% and 60% of all poag cases (leske, 1983; hollows and graham,
1966; bengtsson, 1981; leibowitz et al., 1980; mason et al., 1989;
sommer et al., 1991; klein et al., 1992; coffey et al., 1993;
rotchford and johnson, 2002; rotchford et al., 2003; dandona
et al., 2000) in caucasian, blacks, or indians. however, recent
population-based studies showed that more than 80% of japanese
or hispanics patients with poag had normal iop (iwase et al., 2004;
varma et al., 2004). the only multicentered prospective study that
assessed the rate of progression of untreated  xxxd2741xxx  found that the
estimated mean md slopes averaged 0.41 db/year in these cases
(collaborative norman-tension glaucoma study group, 2001).
since the postoperative estimated mean md slope in eyes with
progressive  xxxd2741xxx  in which the iop decreased to 10 mmhg after
trabeculectomy (hagiwara et al., 2000; shigeeda et al., 2002) was
about 0.40 db/year, iop-independent destructive factors may be
responsible for a substantial portion of the progression in  xxxd2741xxx 
cases. furthermore, glaucomatous damage caused substantial
transsynaptic secondary neurodegeneration in the cns visual
pathway (lam et al., 2003; yücel et al., 2003; ito et al., 2009; gupta
et al., 2007), and ocular hypotensive therapy should have no direct
beneﬁts on secondary neurodegeneration in the cns visual
pathway. ccbs have been long and widely used to treat essential
hypertension and certain types of cardiac diseases, and their clinical safety is well established. oral ccbs should exert a pharmacologic effect in the eye and cns, and ccbs with high lipophilicity and
higher selectivity for cerebral vessels such as  xxxd2728xxx  or  xxxd2726xxx  may have some advantages for treating cns lesions.
despite a number of in vivo and in vitro studies in experimental
animal models of cerebral ischemia or injury that found neuroprotective effects with a variety of ccbs, no clinical studies have
conﬁrmed the clinical efﬁcacy of those drugs in stroke or cerebral
ischemia, which are acute and lethal cns diseases (the american
 xxxd2728xxx  study group, 1992; franke et al., 1996; cheng et al.,
2004; labiche and grotta, 2004). on the other hand, signiﬁcant
positive effects found in a subgroup of study subjects treated with
120 mg  xxxd2728xxx  within 18 h of stroke suggested that immediate
and high-dose administration were required for treating stroke
(the american  xxxd2728xxx  study group, 1992). however, the
results of clinical studies in acute cerebral diseases may not be
applicable to much more chronic and local neurodegenerative
ocular diseases such as oag.
although all prospective clinical studies were relatively small
and single-centered, the results agreed that systemic ccbs might
retard progression at least in a subset of  xxxd2741xxx  cases. improving our
investigation of the pathogenesis of poag, especially of  xxxd2741xxx ,
which may be caused by more than a few etiologic factors, is
essential for developing new treatments. the possibility that
a ccb may be a new treatment modality cannot be excluded. use
of a ccb to treat oag should be validated by multicentered
randomized clinical trials.
