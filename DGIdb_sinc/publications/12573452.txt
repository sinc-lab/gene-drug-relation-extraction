abstract
prostaglandin h synthase 2 ( xxxg1884xxx ), a highly inducible isoenzyme, is responsible for overproduction of the prostaglandins (pgs) in
inflammatory sites.
we established that among fish oil polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas),  xxxd2318xxx  (epa), but not docosahexaenoic acid
(dha), greatly decreased interleukin-1h (il-1h)-induced  xxxg1884xxx  expression in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells
(hpmecs). lipoxygenase products 12 (s)-hydroperoxyeicosapentaenoic acid ((s)-hpepe), 15 (s)-hpepe and leukotriene (lt) d5
reproduced similar inhibitory effect, suggesting that they may be the intermediate metabolites responsible for  xxxg1884xxx  down-regulation by
epa. accordingly, the epa effect is prevented by  xxxd2748xxx  ( xxxd2748xxx ) and by rev 5901, nonspecific and specific 5lipoxygenase inhibitors, respectively. besides, inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity by ibuprofen, indomethacin or aspirin was not able to
prevent this effect. moreover, cyclooxygenase metabolites of epa (pgs d3, e3 and i3) markedly potentiate il-1h-induced  xxxg1884xxx 
expression, probably by increasing intracellular camp levels. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) are known to be activated
by  xxxd2154xxx  (fas) such as epa. we found here that hpmecs express only weak amounts of  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  whose activation by
synthetic agonists, wy-14,643 and ciglitazone, does not cause any inhibition of il-1h-induced  xxxg1884xxx  expression. this finding ruled out the
involvement of ppars in the epa inhibitory effect. in addition, we established that epa, which failed to inhibit nuclear factor-nb (nf-nb)
activation, suppressed p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) phosphorylation in stimulated hpmecs.
our data demonstrate that epa, unlike dha, down-regulates  xxxg1884xxx  expression in hpmecs probably through its 5-lipoxygenasedependent metabolites and advocates a beneficial role for this fa in limiting inflammatory response.

1. introduction
prostaglandin h synthase (pghs) isoforms 1 and 2
catalyze prostaglandin (pg) synthesis from  xxxd2154xxx 
(fas) including arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic (epa) and
docosahexaenoic (dha) acids [1].  xxxg1884xxx , an immediate
early response gene, is rapidly induced by lipopolysaccharide (lps), phorbol esters and cytokines [2 – 5]. this
enzyme, responsible for the overproduction of prostanoids
in various diseases, including cancer [6] and rheumatoid
arthritis [7], constitutes an important target for preventing

or treating these pathological states [8,9].  xxxg1884xxx  upregulation by interleukin-1h (il-1h) involved mitogenactivated protein kinases (mapks) (c-jun nh2 terminal
kinase (jnk), p42/44 and p38 mapk and nuclear factornb (nf-nb) cascades [10 – 12]. moreover, we have recently
reported that il-1h induces  xxxg1884xxx  expression in human
pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hpmecs)
through nf-nb and p38 mapk signalling pathways [13].
in fact, vascular endothelial cells, at the inner surface of
blood vessels, constitute a primary target for inflammatory
agents and play a pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of inflammation.
in the present study, we investigate the eventual
modulatory role of polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas)
of the n 3 family (n 3) on  xxxg1884xxx  expression.
indeed, n 3 pufas, abundantly present in fish oil, exert
curative effects in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis [14] and multiple sclerosis [15]. they reduce
the risk of acute coronary thrombotic events [16] and
have also potential antitumoral and antimetastatic properties [17].
epa (c20:5 n 3) and dha (c22:6 n 3), two main
n 3 pufas, are able to inhibit  xxxd208xxx -induced
platelet aggregation and  xxxg2253xxx  desensitization [18]. moreover, epa suppressed il-6 production in
resting and lps- or  xxxg2296xxx -stimulated human endothelial
cells [19] and reduced pgi2 and pge2 synthesis in bovine
endothelial cells and mouse macrophage cell line raw264.7,
respectively [20,21]. in contrast, increased levels of pgi2
were observed in rat vascular smooth muscle cells treated
with epa [22]. both epa and dha attenuate the expression of  xxxg1883xxx  in bovine endothelial cells [20,23] and
 xxxg1884xxx  in bovine chondrocytes [24]. however, in mouse
macrophage cell line raw264.7,  xxxg1884xxx  was up-regulated by epa [21].
recently, it has been reported that fas and pgs were able
to regulate gene expression through activation of peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) [25,26], members
of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent
transcription factors. ppars regulate the expression of target
genes by binding to dna sequence known as a ppar
response element (ppre) [27] present in  xxxg1884xxx  promoter
[28]. three different subtypes have been described,  xxxg1805xxx ,
-y and -g [29]. epa, a natural ligand for ppars, activates the
three forms with a high affinity for  xxxg1805xxx  [25,30]. various
studies demonstrated the modulating role of ppar activators
in  xxxg1884xxx  gene expression. indeed,  xxxg1807xxx  agonists suppressed  xxxg1884xxx  expression in human epithelial cells [31]
and increased it in mammary epithelial cells and rabbit
corneal epithelium cell line [28,32].
in the present work, we notably found that epa, unlike
dha, down-regulates  xxxg1884xxx  expression in response to
il-1h. this effect is mediated through lipoxygenase metabolites of epa and required p38 mapk signalling pathway.
however, neither nf-nb nor ppars factors are involved in
this process.

western blotting detection system and peroxidase-linked
donkey anti-rabbit igg were purchased from amersham
(buckinghamshire, england). agarose and trizol reagent
were from gibco-brl (gaithersburg, md).
2.2. preparation of hpmec culture
hpmecs were isolated as previously described [4] and
cultured on dishes precoated with 1% rat tail collagen type i.
confluent cells from fifth to eighth passages were used for
experiments.
2.3. measurement of intracellular camp formation
suspensions of hpmecs (400 al, 107 cells/ml) were
exposed to pge3 (3 am), pgi3 (3 am) or pgd3 (3 am) for
5 min, and then 800 al of ethanol was added. camp amount
contained in each sample was determined by a specific kit
according to the enzyme immunoassay method of pradelles
et al. [33].
2.4. western blot analysis
immunoblot analysis was performed according to
laemmli [34]. briefly, cell proteins were separated through
10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. the latter were blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk in the following buffer (tris
20 mm, ph 7.6, nacl 140 mm and 0.1% tween 20) and
then incubated for 1 h with monoclonal antibodies antipghs-2 or anti-h-actin (diluted to 1:1000). the secondary

antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep antimouse (diluted to 1:10,000) and ecl reagent was used for
detection.
for the western blot detection of p38 mapk, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 jc with specific
antibodies against total or phospho-p38 mapk (diluted to

nf-nb (5v-agttgaggggactttcccagg-3v). the
samples were electrophoresed on 6% acrylamide gels, made
in 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx  containing 380 mm glycine and 2 mm
edta followed by autoradiography using a bio-max
intensifying screen from kodak at 80 jc. the specific
dna – protein complexes were suppressed by an addition
of excess unlabeled oligonucleotides for each nuclear transcription factor.

control samples were performed using the unpaired student’s t-test.

3. results
3.1. effects of epa and dha on il-1b-induced  xxxg1884xxx 
expression in hpmecs
we examined the modulating role of pufas, epa and
dha on  xxxg1884xxx  expression. cultured hpmecs were
preincubated with epa or dha for 1 h at various concentrations (0 –30 am) and then exposed for 6 h in the presence
or absence of il-1h (0.3 ng/ml). as shown in fig. 1a,
immunoblotting analysis revealed that epa decreased, in a
concentration-dependent manner,  xxxg1884xxx  protein expression induced by il-1h. in contrast, under the same conditions, no significant variation was observed with dha.
neither epa nor dha modified  xxxg1883xxx  protein expression
(data not shown).
the kinetic study (0 – 2 h) showed that inhibition of
 xxxg1884xxx  protein expression by epa was optimal 1 h before
il-1h addition (data not shown).
to assess whether epa modulates  xxxg1884xxx  at the mrna
step, we performed rt-pcr on total hpmec rna after
cell treatment for 1 h in the presence or absence of epa (30
am) or dha (30 am) followed by il-1h (0.3 ng/ml)
stimulation for 4 h. in accordance with immunoblotting

2.6. rt-pcr and pcr product analysis
total rna was isolated from hpmecs using trizol
reagent and processed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. samples were resuspended in rnase-free water
and concentrations determined spectrophotometrically.
three micrograms of each sample was used for rt-pcr
to generate human hpmec  xxxg1884xxx , h-actin,  xxxg1805xxx  and
 xxxg1807xxx  pcr products of 305, 263, 948 and 900 bp,
respectively. semiquantitative pcr was performed for 35
cycles for  xxxg1884xxx , 25 cycles for h-actin and 38 cycles for
ppar isoforms. pcr amplifications for  xxxg1884xxx  and hactin cdna were done according to our previous study [4].
we used the primers described by chinetti et al. [36]: for
 xxxg1805xxx , sense 5v-gacgaatgccaagatctgagaaagc-3vand antisense 5v-cgtctcctttgtagtgctgtcagc-3v; for  xxxg1807xxx , sense 5v-ggcaattgaatg
tcgtgtctgtggagataa-3vand antisense 5v-agctccagggcttgtagcaggttgtcttga-3v. the final
pcr products were run on 1.5% agarose gel and blotted
onto nylon membranes.  xxxg1884xxx  and h-actin cdna were
detected by hybridization with specific [g-32p]-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide probes as described elsewhere [4].
2.7. statistical analysis
results are expressed as mean f s.e. of three separate
experiments and statistical significances between treated and

in section 2. results are representative of two separate experiments.

results (fig. 1a),  xxxg1884xxx  mrna level was attenuated by
epa but not by dha (fig. 1b).
then, we investigated whether the inhibitory effect of
epa on  xxxg1884xxx  expression was due to its elongation to
docosapentaenoic acid (dpa, 22:5, n 3). thus, hpmec
pretreatment with dpa (1– 100 am) did not modify pghs2 expression by il-1h (data not shown).
3.2. role of cyclooxygenase activity in the epa-induced
 xxxg1884xxx  down-regulation
in order to determine the enzyme involved in epa
generated derivatives leading to  xxxg1884xxx  down-regulation,
we examined the effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (nsaids) including aspirin, indomethacin and ibuprofen, which are all inhibitors of cyclooxygenase activity.
hpmecs were pretreated for 30 min with or without these
drugs followed by 1 h epa (30 am) treatment and then
incubated with il-1h (0.3 ng/ml) for 6 h. we showed that all
tested nsaids failed to prevent the inhibitory effect caused
by epa (data not shown). accordingly, no inhibitory effect
on  xxxg1884xxx  expression was observed when hpmecs were
treated with cyclooxygenase prostanoid derived metabolites
of epa (pgs: pgi3, pgd3 or pge3) (fig. 2a). on the
contrary, these prostanoids significantly increase, in a con-

without  xxxd2748xxx  (20 am, panel a) or rev 5901 (10 am, panel b) before
their incubation with epa (30 am) for 1 h. then, cells were stimulated with
il-1h (0.3 ng/ml) for 6 h.  xxxg1884xxx  protein level was analyzed by
immunoblotting. results are representative of two separate experiments.

centration-dependent manner,  xxxg1884xxx  induction by il-1h
(fig. 2a).
the evaluation of camp generated 5 min after the
prostanoid addition (3 am of pgi3, pgd3 or pge3)
showed a significant increase in intracellular camp levels
(fig. 2b), known for its ability to up-regulate  xxxg1884xxx 
expression [4,37].
3.3. role of lipoxygenase activity in the epa-induced
 xxxg1884xxx  down-regulation
fig. 2. effect of pgs on camp formation and il-1h-induced  xxxg1884xxx 
expression. panel a: effect of pgs on  xxxg1884xxx  induction by il-1h.
adherent hpmecs were preincubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of
various concentrations (0 – 10 am) of pgs (pge3, pgi3 or pgd3). then,
cells were stimulated with il-1h (0.3 ng/ml) for 6 h and  xxxg1884xxx  protein
level was analyzed by immunoblotting. results are representative of three
separate experiments. panel b: effect of pgs on camp production.
hpmecs were exposed to pgs (pge3, pgi3 or pgd3) at 3 am for 5 min,
then 800 al of ethanol was added to 400 al of cell suspension.  xxxd1742xxx  (50
am) was used in parallel as a standard of adenylyl cyclase activator. camp
amounts contained in each sample were determined as indicated in section
2. results are expressed as the mean f s.e. of three separate experiments
(*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 when compared to control untreated cells).

in order to identify the metabolic pathway involved in the
observed inhibitory effect of epa, a general lipoxygenase
inhibitor,  xxxd2748xxx , and a specific inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx ,
rev 5901 [38], were tested. hpmecs were pretreated for
30 min with or without  xxxd2748xxx  (20 am) or rev 5901 (10
am), and then exposed to epa (30 am) for 1 h followed by
il-1h stimulation for 6 h (0.3 ng/ml). data showed that
 xxxd2748xxx  (fig. 3a) and rev 5901 (fig. 3b) prevented the
inhibitory effect of epa on  xxxg1884xxx  expression.

epa really resulted from its conversion by lipoxygenase

cantly decreased  xxxg1884xxx  expression. moreover, 12- and 15(s)-hepe were without effect (data not shown).

fig. 4. effects of lipoxygenase metabolites on il-1h-induced  xxxg1884xxx

ltb5) at various concentrations (0 – 1 am) and then stimulated with il-1h
(0.3 ng/ml) for 6 h. results are representative of three separate experiments.

pathways (5-, 12- and 15-lipoxygenases), cells were incubated with a panel of lipoxygenase products derived from
epa before il-1h addition. thus, hpmecs were exposed for
1 h to 12- or 15-(s)-hydroperoxyeicosapentaenoic acid ((s)hpepe), two epa metabolites resulting from 12- and 15lipoxygenases, respectively, and incubated for 6 h with il1h. moreover, we tested the effect of lts, ltb5 and ltd5,
which are converted from epa by  xxxg147xxx . as shown
in fig. 4, we found that both 12- and 15-(s)-hpepe markedly
decreased  xxxg1884xxx  protein level induced by il-1h. in addition, ltd5, but not ltb5, also progressively and signifi-

described in section 2. the results are representative of three separate
experiments. panel ba: failure of  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  activators to modify
 xxxg1884xxx  expression. cells were exposed for 1 h to various concentrations

respectively. then, hpmecs were stimulated in the presence or absence of
il-1h (0.3 ng/ml) for 6 h.  xxxg1884xxx  expression was analyzed by
immunoblotting. the results are representative of three separate experiments.
panel bb: mrna levels of  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  in hpmecs. total rna from
untreated hpmecs was extracted and rt-pcr was performed as described
in section 2. results are representative of two separate experiments.

we have recently established that nf-nb is required for
il-1h-induced  xxxg1884xxx  expression in hpmecs [13]. therefore, we investigated the role of this transcriptional nuclear
factor in epa-inhibited  xxxg1884xxx  expression. thus, nuclear
proteins isolated from epa (30 am)-treated hpmecs for 1
h followed by il-1h addition (0.3 ng/ml for 30 min) were
analyzed by emsa using a radiolabeled dna probe containing the nf-nb consensus sequence. the results of fig.
5a indicated that nf-nb-dna binding complexes formed
in response to il-1h stimulation were not abolished by epa.
it has been established that epa, a natural ligand for
ppars, activates different ppar isoforms [25,30]. recent
studies have reported that epa regulated gene expression
through ppars signalling pathways [26,39]. we tested the
involvement of these nuclear factors in epa-induced pghs2 down-regulation. we investigated the possibility that wy14,643 (0– 100 am) and ciglitazone (0-100 am), two potent
activators of  xxxg1805xxx  and g, respectively, affects il-1hmediated  xxxg1884xxx  induction. as shown in fig. 5ba, no

then, cells were treated for 5 min with or without il-1h (0.3 ng/ml).
cellular extracts were immunoblotted with p38 mapk antibodies. the spot
evaluation of immunoblotting intensity corresponding to phosphorylated
and total p38 mapk was performed by imagequant. results are
representative of two separate experiments.

change of  xxxg1884xxx  protein levels was observed in response
to either ppar agonists. accordingly,  xxxg1805xxx  and g immunoblotting analysis failed to detect any expression of ppar
isoforms (data not shown). in addition, rt-pcr analysis of
total hpmec rna revealed only small amounts of  xxxg1805xxx 
and g mrnas after 38 cycles (fig. 5bb).
previously, we have shown that p38 mapk plays a key
role in il-1h-induced  xxxg1884xxx  expression [13]. we tested
here whether such a kinase may be a major target of epa.
as indicated in fig. 6, p38 mapk phosphorylation induced
by il-1h was greatly decreased when hpmecs were
treated by epa or its lipoxygenase-dependent derivatives
(12-, 15-(s)-hpepe or ltd5). under these conditions,
ltb5 had no effect.

4. discussion
we have previously demonstrated that il-1h induced
 xxxg1884xxx  expression in hpmecs through nf-nb and p38
mapk signalling pathways [13]. in the present study, we
investigated the modulation of  xxxg1884xxx  expression by two
n 3 pufas, eicosapentaenoic (epa, 20:5, n 3) and
docosahexaenoic (dha, 22:6, n 3) acids, which are well
known for their beneficial effects against thrombosis, arthritis and cancer [17,18,24,40].
we reported here for the first time that epa, but not dha,
significantly inhibited il-1h-induced  xxxg1884xxx  protein and
messenger expressions in hpmecs. under the same conditions, neither epa nor dha modified  xxxg1883xxx  expression.
by contrast, achard et al. [20], using primary bovine aortic
endothelial cells, showed a significant decrease in  xxxg1883xxx 
mrna levels following epa or dha treatment.
contrary to our findings, dha decreases  xxxg1169xxx - or lpsinduced  xxxg1884xxx  expression in bovine chondrocytes [24]
and murine macrophage cell line raw 264.7 [41], respectively. this discrepancy may be attributed to both cell type
specificity and the nature of the agonist.
to explain the down-regulation of  xxxg1884xxx  gene expression caused by epa, we tested whether its elongation
product (dpa, 22:5, n 3), described in epa-treated bovine
aortic endothelial cells [42], may mimic epa effect. in fact,
when hpmecs were treated with dpa instead of epa, no
 xxxg1884xxx  inhibition was observed, indicating that the epa
effect was not linked to its elongation step. then, we
investigated the involvement of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways in this process. epa is metabolized by
cyclooxygenases to thromboxane a3 and pgs including
pgd3, pge3 and pgi3 [43]. moreover, epa is also converted to lts (lta5, ltb5 and ltd5) by  xxxg147xxx ,
or to 12- and 15-(s)-hpepe by 12- and 15-lipoxygenases,
respectively. in any respect, cyclooxygenase activity inhibitors such as aspirin, ibuprofen or indomethacin failed to
reverse epa effect. surprisingly, cyclooxygenase-derived
metabolites of epa such as pgd3, pge3 and pgi3 had
an opposite effect compared to their precursor epa. thus,

these findings clearly indicate that epa inhibits  xxxg1884xxx 
expression through a cyclooxygenase-independent mechanism.  xxxg1884xxx  up-regulation by pgs seems to be linked to
their ability to enhance intracellular camp levels. the latter
findings are in agreement with our previous work [4] as well
as with previously reported results [37,44], demonstrating
the role of intracellular camp in the  xxxg1884xxx  up-regulation.
this process may be mediated through camp response
element (cre) site present in the promoter of human
 xxxg1884xxx  gene [45]. a correlation seems to be established
between the efficacy of different pgs to enhance intracellular camp levels and  xxxg1884xxx  induction. indeed, both
camp generation and  xxxg1884xxx  induction are greater when
pge3 was used compared to pgi3 and pgd3.
in contrast to cyclooxygenase-derived metabolites of
epa, lipoxygenase products 12-(s)-hpepe, 15-(s)-hpepe
and ltd5 greatly decreased  xxxg1884xxx  induction by il-1h.
under the same conditions, ltb5 failed to modify this
enzyme expression. accordingly,  xxxd2748xxx , a general lipoxygenase inhibitor, abolished the epa effect, indicating the
pivotal role of lipoxygenase pathways in  xxxg1884xxx  downregulation. the fact that rev 5901, a specific inhibitor of 5lipoxygenase [38], reverses completely the epa effect, as
efficiently as  xxxd2748xxx  suggests that 12- and 15-lipoxygenase
metabolites, even if they are very efficient (fig. 4), do not
represent major endogenous actors in hpmecs.
furthermore, the failure of dha to inhibit  xxxg1884xxx 
induction is probably due to its limited metabolism by
lipoxygenase pathways. indeed, this fa is a poor substrate
for lt-synthesizing systems [46].
transcriptional up-regulation of proinflammatory genes,
such as  xxxg1884xxx  [13], is strongly dependent on nf-nb
activation. various studies established an interference between pufas and this regulatory factor [47,48]. in our
system, we found that epa failed to modify il-1h-induced
nf-nb activation, suggesting the non-involvement of this
signalling pathway in epa effect. however, lee et al. [49],
using murine macrophage-like cell line raw 264.7,
reported that epa prevented  xxxg1884xxx  induction through a
nf-nb-dependent mechanism.
multiple ligands for ppars have been described: n 3
pufas, pgs and nsaids, which are substrates, products
and inhibitors for  xxxg1884xxx , respectively [25,26]. moreover,
a ppar response element (ppre) sequence has been
identified in the promoter region of  xxxg1884xxx  gene [28].
as epa binds to, and activates efficiently all ppar isoforms
(a, h and g) [25,30], we examined the potential role of
ppars in the down-regulation of  xxxg1884xxx  by epa. the
results of meade et al. [28] describing an increase of pghs2 expression in epithelial cells by all ppar ligands are in
contrast with those of subbaramaiah et al. [31], suggesting
the role of  xxxg1807xxx  agonists in  xxxg1884xxx  down-regulation. in
hpmecs, we found that both wy-14,643 (a fibrate) and
ciglitazone (a thiazolidinedione),  xxxg1805xxx  and g activators,
respectively, failed to exhibit any effect on il-1h-induced
 xxxg1884xxx  expression. to examine whether the failure of

f. ait-said et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1631 (2003) 77–84

ppar agonist-induced  xxxg1884xxx  gene modulation is due to
ppars absence in hpmecs, we analysed their expression.
thus, rt-pcr experiments showed that hpmecs
expressed both ppar a and g mrnas. it is interesting to
outline that no detectable levels of ppar isoforms were
observed in both human umbilical [50] and bovine [51]
arterial endothelial cells, underlying the heterogeneity of
their cellular expression.
western blot analysis using specific  xxxg1805xxx  and -g
antibodies did not yield a detectable signal for any ppar
isoforms. in addition, their expression observed by rt-pcr
required a high amplification (38 cycles), suggesting that
hpmecs express only low ppar levels. this weak expression of ppars by these cells may explain, at least in part,
the failure of ciglitazone and wy-14,643 to modify  xxxg1884xxx 
protein levels. since ppar synthetic activators did not
mimic the inhibitory epa effect on this enzyme induction,
it is tempting to speculate that epa down-regulates  xxxg1884xxx 
expression through a ppar-independent pathway.
previously, we have established that p38 mapk, but not
p42/44 mapks, is required to promote  xxxg1884xxx  induction by
il-1h in hpmecs [13]. we tested here whether p38 mapk
is involved in this epa inhibitory effect. interestingly, we
found that epa as well as its lipoxygenase-derived metabolites (12-, 15-(s)-hpepe and ltd5) inhibited il-1h-induced
p38 mapk phosphorylation, suggesting that  xxxg1884xxx  downregulation by epa may be mediated, at least in part, by p38
mapk signalling pathway inhibition. however, although a
recent study reported that epa decreased protein kinases c
and a activities [52], the intimate mechanism by which epa
decreased p38 mapk phosphorylation remains unknown.
altogether our findings demonstrate that epa, unlike
dha, down-regulates  xxxg1884xxx  expression induced by il1h mainly through its  xxxg147xxx  metabolites. this
process was independent of ppars and nf-nb signalling
pathways and dependent on that of p38 mapk. our results
not only increase our knowledge concerning  xxxg1884xxx  gene
regulation, but also provide supporting molecular data for
the potential therapeutic benefits of epa in inflammatory
diseases.
