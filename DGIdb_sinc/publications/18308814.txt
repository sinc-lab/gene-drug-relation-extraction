abstract
asenapine is a novel psychopharmacologic agent under development for
the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. we determined
and compared the human receptor binding affinities and functional
characteristics of asenapine and several antipsychotic drugs. compounds
were tested under comparable assay conditions using cloned human
receptors. in comparison with the antipsychotics, asenapine showed high
affinity and a different rank order of binding affinities (pki) for serotonin
receptors (5-ht1a [8.6], 5-ht1b [8.4], 5-ht2a [10.2], 5-ht2b [9.8],
5-ht2c [10.5], 5-ht5 [8.8],  xxxg1119xxx  [9.6] and 5-ht7 [9.9]), adrenoceptors
(1 [8.9], 2a [8.9], 2b [9.5] and 2c [8.9]), dopamine receptors
(d1 [8.9], d2 [8.9], d3 [9.4] and d4 [9.0]) and histamine receptors
(h1 [9.0] and h2 [8.2]). it had much lower affinity (pki  5) for
muscarinic receptors and was the only agent with affinity for h2 receptors.
relative to its  xxxg656xxx  affinity, asenapine had a higher affinity for

5-ht2c, 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b, 5-ht7,  xxxg1119xxx , 2b and d3 receptors, suggesting
stronger engagement of these targets at therapeutic doses. asenapine
behaved as a potent antagonist (pkb) at 5-ht1a (7.4), 5-ht1b (8.1),
5-ht2a (9.0), 5-ht2b (9.3), 5-ht2c (9.0),  xxxg1119xxx  (8.0), 5-ht7 (8.5), d2
(9.1), d3 (9.1), 2a (7.3), 2b (8.3), 2c (6.8) and h1 (8.4) receptors.
these functional effects differed from those of risperidone (pkb  5 for
 xxxg1119xxx ) and  xxxd2773xxx  (pkb  5 for 5-ht1a and 2). our results indicate
that asenapine has a unique human receptor signature, with binding
affinity and antagonistic properties that differ appreciably from those
of antipsychotic drugs.

introduction

therapeutic molecular targets are likely to continue to provide a
more effective approach in treating the diverse symptoms of schizophrenia (roth, et al., 2003, 2004b).
the multitarget atypical antipsychotics have an advantage over
older conventional drugs in terms of decreased extrapyramidal
symptoms, as well as more limited advantages in positive and negative symptom efficacy (davis et al., 2003; moller, 2003). atypical
antipsychotics have complex and distinctive pharmacologic profiles, with affinity for multiple receptors and their subtypes, as
reviewed by arnt and skarsfeldt (1998), blin (1999), seeman
(2002), remington (2003), roth et al. (2003, 2004b), stahl (2003)
and dean and scarr (2004). these complex receptor-binding profiles vary widely among different agents, although most of the atypical antipsychotics display a high 5-ht2a/d2 affinity ratio. however,
this feature alone seems unlikely to explain the differences between
atypical and conventional antipsychotics (meltzer et al., 2003).

schizophrenia is a highly complex, multidimensional disorder with
considerable unmet medical needs in terms of negative, cognitive
and affective symptom alleviation. a number of potential therapeutic molecular targets with varying degrees of clinical validation
have been identified, including several serotonin, norepinephrine,
and dopamine receptor subtypes and cholinergic and glutamate
receptors (rowley et al., 2001). a focus on the  xxxg656xxx , initially alone, but later in combination with the serotonin
 xxxg1113xxx  for improved tolerability, has been relatively effective in addressing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
however, attempts to develop single molecular target-based therapies have been unsuccessful in addressing the broad treatment
demands of schizophrenia (roth et al., 2003; lindenmayer and
khan, 2004). consequently, agents acting on selected multiple

asenapine: unique human receptor signature

it remains unclear whether it is the total number of receptor targets or the relative contributions of multiple relevant targets that are
the critical factors in driving improvements in efficacy and tolerability.
indeed, despite the diversity in pharmacologic profiles among current atypical antipsychotics, these differences have translated primarily into differences in tolerability rather than efficacy (geddes
et al., 2000; davis et al., 2003; moller, 2003). although extrapyramidal and prolactin-related adverse effects have been decreased in
some cases, other tolerability and safety concerns have surfaced
with some of these agents, including increased cardiovascular risk
signaled by weight gain and other health-threatening metabolic
consequences, such as diabetes (newcomer, 2004).
the unmet medical need in schizophrenia remains high, with an
estimated 30% of patients not responding satisfactorily to current
treatment (lindenmayer and khan, 2004), and for those who do,
only a small percentage are able to return to the workplace. in particular, the treatment of negative symptoms has been a challenge;
persistent negative symptoms have been associated with impaired
functionality and quality of life (svirskis et al., 2007) and generally
poorer outcomes (moller et al., 2000), but none of the existing
antipsychotic drugs has been consistently effective in controlling
negative symptoms. cognitive impairment is another common feature of schizophrenia that adversely affects outcome (stip, 2006),
especially in the area of vocational functionality (holthausen et al.,
2007), but antipsychotic drugs have shown uneven effects in this
area (stip, 2006). thus, there is a need for new drugs with better
efficacy against negative symptoms and the cognitive deficits of
schizophrenia, while maintaining relief of positive symptoms and
providing a better safety profile.
asenapine is a novel psychopharmacologic agent currently in
development for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
the results of an initial clinical study with asenapine suggest that
asenapine may provide efficacy and tolerability advantages in the
management of acute schizophrenia (potkin et al., 2007). the receptor interactions of asenapine may indicate potential clinical features.
to determine the potential differentiating features of asenapine
and to gain mechanistic insight, the human receptor-binding and
functional characteristics of asenapine were determined across a
range of cloned human serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine and muscarinic receptors. the receptor-binding affinity and
functional activity of asenapine were compared with that of a number of antipsychotic drugs under comparable assay conditions.

methods
asenapine was synthesized at nv organon (oss, the netherlands);
other drugs and reagents were supplied by sigma-aldrich (poole,
uk) or tocris cookson ltd (bristol, uk). radioligands were
obtained from nen life science products (boston, ma, usa) and
amersham biosciences (amersham, uk).

receptor-binding assays
receptor-binding assays were performed using cloned human serotonin (5-ht1a, 5-ht1b, 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b, 5-ht2c,  xxxg1118xxx ,  xxxg1119xxx ,

5-ht7), norepinephrine (1a, 2a, 2b, 2c), dopamine (d1, d2s,
d2l, d3, d4), histamine (h1, h2) and muscarinic (m1, m2, m3, m4)
receptors. most of the assays used mammalian cell lines stably
expressing single cloned human receptors (table 1), which were
grown in culture medium (dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
with 10% calf serum) at 37°c in 5% co2. for  xxxg1118xxx  and
1a-adrenoceptor assays, receptors were expressed transiently in
cos-7 cells. host cells were harvested, pelleted and stored at
–80°c before assay. crude membrane preparations were obtained
by homogenizing cell pellets in ice-cold assay buffer (see table 1
for buffer details), followed by centrifugation (30 000–48 000 g,
10–20 min, 4°c).
assays were performed in standard 96-well plates. binding was
initiated by addition of diluted membranes, and the assay was incubated at room temperature (22–25°c, except for 5-ht1b assays at
37°c) for 45 to 120 min, depending on the individual assay, until
binding reached equilibrium. nonspecific binding was defined in
the presence of saturating concentrations of the compounds listed
in table 1. incubation was terminated by filtration over packard
gf/b 96-well filter plates soaked in ice-cold assay buffer containing 0.3% polyethylenimine, followed by three to six ice-cold assay
buffer washes using a tomtec cell harvester (receptor
technologies ltd, adderbury, uk). radioactivity bound to filters
was quantified using liquid scintillation counting in microscint-20
(perkinelmer las ltd, beaconsfield, uk). the dissociation constant (kd) for the radioligand in each assay was determined on a
single 96-well plate with total and nonspecific binding in triplicate
wells at 8 to 12 increasing concentrations of radiolabel at a fixed
protein concentration.
for competition assays, specific binding was determined by
subtracting nonspecific binding from all data points. data were
analysed using nonlinear regression with iterative logistic fitting
(graphpad prism; graphpad software inc., san diego, ca, usa),
with the lower asymptote of the fit fixed at zero. log concentration
(six- to eight-point) response curves for each antipsychotic tested,
generated from three curves in one experiment, were constructed
by plotting the log concentration of inhibitor versus specific binding. the concentrations at which 50% of the maximum specific
binding was inhibited (ic50) were normalized to ki values to take
into account the concentration of radiolabel used and its kd according to cheng and prusoff (1973). the affinities for each antipsychotic are reported as ki values or their negative logarithms (pki).
all values are the mean of at least three separate experiments.
d1-, h1- and h2-receptor assays were performed by cerep (paris,
france). asenapine was tested for general specificity in a panel of
90 assays performed at novascreen, organon or pfizer.

functional assays
functional assays were performed using cloned human serotonin
(5-ht1a, 5-ht1b, 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b, 5-ht2c,  xxxg1119xxx , 5-ht7),
dopamine (d2, d3), histamine (h1) and norepinephrine (2a, 2b, 2c)
receptors. asenapine,  xxxd2773xxx  and risperidone were first tested
alone up to 10 m for agonism. in the absence of agonist activity, these
agents were tested for their ability to inhibit functional responses at
each receptor. the assay conditions are summarized in table 2.

asenapine: unique human receptor signature

briefly, a submaximal concentration of agonist was used to evoke
a functional response that was then examined for inhibition across
a wide concentration range (10 pm–10 m) for the three drugs.
ic50 values were determined and converted to pkb values using
the cheng–prusoff equation (cheng and prusoff, 1973).

results
receptor-binding activity
asenapine (trans-5-chloro-2,3,3a,12b-tetrahydro-2-methyl-1hdibenz [2,3:6,7] oxepino [4,5-c] pyrrole) is derived from a different
chemical template than those of atypical antipsychotics and
haloperidol (see chemical structures inset in figure 1). asenapine
has high affinity (ki  5 nm) for an ensemble of human serotonin,
norepinephrine, dopamine and histamine receptor subtypes (table
3). by plotting the pki values of the eight agents tested in the 20
receptors, the rank order of binding affinity for asenapine revealed
a receptor signature distinct from that of the antipsychotic drugs
investigated (figure 1). among all compounds tested, asenapine
showed the highest degree of interaction at serotonin receptors 5ht2c (ki  0.034 nm), 5-ht2a (0.07), 5-ht7 (0.11), 5-ht2b (0.18)
and  xxxg1119xxx  (0.25); 2b-adrenergic receptors (0.33) and d3 receptors
(0.42). in addition, asenapine showed nanomolar affinity for a variety of other receptors, including  xxxg1118xxx , 5-ht1a and 5-ht1b
(ki  1.4, 2.7 and 4.0 nm, respectively); d4, d2l, d2s and d1 (1.1,
1.3, 1.4 and 1.4 nm, respectively); 1a-, 2a- and 2c-adrenergic
(all 1.2 nm) and h1 and h2 receptors (1.0 and 6.2 nm, respectively).
for most of the receptor subtypes listed above (where asenapine had either nanomolar or subnanomolar affinity), asenapine
exhibited the highest affinity of all agents tested in this study, with
the exception of 5-ht1a receptors (for which ziprasidone had a
higher affinity) and 5-ht1b receptors (for which both aripiprazole
and ziprasidone had higher affinities). the affinity of asenapine
for 5-ht2c and 2b-adrenergic receptors is at least 30-fold higher
than that of the other agents tested, and its affinity for  xxxg1118xxx  and
 xxxg1119xxx  receptors is almost 15-fold higher than any other drugs
examined. asenapine appears to be the only agent with appreciable affinity for h2 receptors.  xxxd2773xxx  and clozapine showed the
highest affinity for muscarinic receptors; in contrast, asenapine
was devoid of activity at these receptors.
receptor specificity although asenapine has high affinity for a
number of receptors, its pharmacologic specificity was examined
in a broad receptor screen. asenapine had no appreciable binding
affinity at muscarinic (m1, m2, m3 and m4) receptor subtypes and
displayed low affinity (1 m) for 1- and 2-adrenergic, h3 and
5-ht3 receptors (data not shown). in monoamine uptake assays,
asenapine had no appreciable activity at dopamine, norepinefigure 1 selected receptor signatures of asenapine and comparator antipsychotic agents. the dotted line represents the respective pki for the d2l receptor. n  3, except for d1 (aripiprazole

affinity relative to  xxxg656xxx  an additional comparison of
binding affinities with asenapine and other compounds tested can
be achieved by expressing a ratio with reference to d2l receptor
affinity (table 3, figure 2). the higher affinity of asenapine for 5ht2c receptors relative to d2 receptors (38-fold greater) is a characteristic also displayed by clozapine (48-fold) and to a lesser extent
by ziprasidone (eight-fold) and  xxxd2773xxx  (six-fold), and in clear
contrast to risperidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine and haloperidol.
asenapine shows a higher relative affinity for both
 xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors, with 5- to 12-fold selectivity over d2

receptors, similar to clozapine (15- to 20-fold). in contrast, none of
the other drugs tested showed this combined  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7
receptor profile. in common with most atypical antipsychotics, asenapine has high affinity for 5-ht2a receptors (19-fold greater)
relative to d2 receptors. the higher relative affinity of asenapine for
d3 receptors is similar to that of ziprasidone but not shared by the
other drugs tested. the 5-ht1a and  xxxg1109xxx  affinities of
asenapine were comparable with its  xxxg656xxx  activity (ratio of 1),
in contrast to the 10-fold selectivity exhibited by ziprasidone. for
d4, 1, 2a, 2c and h1 receptors, asenapine also has comparable
affinity with that for the  xxxg656xxx  (table 3). this is different from
clozapine, which shows clear selectivity for these receptors. unlike
clozapine,  xxxd2773xxx  and quetiapine, asenapine does not have any
appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors (figure 2). in contrast
to  xxxd2773xxx  and clozapine, asenapine has approximately 6000fold lower affinity for the muscarinic receptors tested relative to its
activity at the  xxxg656xxx .

discussion
asenapine is a psychopharmacologic agent derived from a chemical template different from that of currently available antipsychotics and, as demonstrated in this study, has a human receptor
signature and functional activity profile different from those of
available antipsychotic agents (tables 3 and 4; figure 1). this study
confirms previously reported binding features of asenapine

asenapine: unique human receptor signature

(de boer et al., 1993; richelson and souder, 2000) and extends the
data to include detailed binding and functional characterization in
cloned human receptor preparations.
asenapine has high affinity for an ensemble of receptors,
including the 5-ht receptor subtypes 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b, 5-ht2c,
 xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7; adrenoceptor subtypes 1a, 2a, 2b and 2c and
dopamine d3 and d4 receptors. the interaction of asenapine with
each of these receptors occurred at a higher affinity than that for
any of the other drugs tested. this is particularly apparent when the
receptor signature of asenapine is contrasted with the ‘fingerprint’
of the other drugs (figure 1). asenapine has the potential for
greater recruitment of serotonin receptors compared with the
antipsychotics tested. it has high affinity (5 nm) for eight  xxxg1114xxx  subtypes. although asenapine has strong affinity for
multiple serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine receptor subtypes,
its pharmacologic specificity is demonstrated by being inactive
when tested against a large number of other diverse receptor targets.
asenapine shares some binding characteristics with atypical
antipsychotics, such as appreciable affinity for d2 receptors and a
high 5-ht2a:d2 affinity ratio (table 3; figures 1 and 2). interesting
similarity is observed between asenapine and clozapine, since both
compounds have high affinity for a specific cluster of serotonin
receptors (5-ht1a, 5-ht1b, 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b, 5-ht2c,  xxxg1118xxx ,
 xxxg1119xxx , 5-ht7). nevertheless, there is also a clear distinction
between the two drugs; for example, clozapine shows a higher
affinity for h1, 1, d4, 2a and 2c receptors than for the  xxxg656xxx , in contrast to asenapine, which shows similar affinity for these
receptors. in common with  xxxd2773xxx , clozapine has high affinity
for m1, m2, m3 and m4 receptors (table 3), which might contribute
to anticholinergic adverse effects and the development of metabolic
syndrome (newcomer, 2004; johnson et al., 2005). asenapine has
no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors (figure 2), with the
highest ratio of separation between its affinity for d2 receptors and
m1–4 receptors (at least 6000-fold lower than its affinity for the d2
receptor).
the binding profile of asenapine has little in common with that
of aripiprazole or haloperidol, given their predominant dopaminergic profile and the fact that aripiprazole has been reported to act as
a d2 partial agonist (shapiro et al., 2003).
the main findings from the receptor functional analysis show
that asenapine potently blocks the activity of human serotonin,
-noradrenergic, dopamine and histamine receptors, and that its
antagonist profile differs from that of risperidone and  xxxd2773xxx 
(table 4). asenapine acts as a potent antagonist at cloned human
5-ht1a, 5-ht1b, 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c,  xxxg1119xxx , 5-ht7, d2, d3, 2a, 2b,
2c and h1 receptors. furthermore, its broad serotonergic receptor
interactions appear to be primarily antagonistic under the assay
conditions used in the present study. in contrast to asenapine,  xxxd2773xxx  did not show appreciable activity in blocking 5-ht1a and
2a, 2b and 2c receptors, and risperidone showed weak activity
in the 5-ht2c- and  xxxg1119xxx -receptor assays.
clinical implications for efficacy and tolerability based on the
receptor-binding profile of antipsychotic drugs have been extrapolated for a few receptors (e.g., d2, 5-ht2a). however, recent animal
studies with receptor-subtype-selective drugs, as well as gene-knockout approaches, have provided new insight into the therapeutic util-

7

ity of blocking specific members of the serotonin, norepinephrine
and dopamine receptor families. this discussion was restricted to
receptor subtypes for which the affinity of asenapine is similar to or
higher than its affinity for the  xxxg656xxx . this may represent the
core group of receptors that asenapine is likely to occupy at doses
consistent with clinical efficacy (potkin et al., 2007).
the higher affinity of asenapine for multiple 5-ht receptor subtypes relative to the  xxxg656xxx  suggests the possibility of
differential occupancy, which has the potential to confer clinical
benefits.  xxxg1113xxx  blockade has, for example, been reported
to be a key mechanism for alleviating, in part, negative symptoms
in schizophrenia (lieberman et al., 1998; meltzer et al., 2003;
lane et al., 2005), and recent evidence also lends support to a role
for the  xxxg1115xxx  in this regard (reynolds et al., 2005). the
combined potent 5-ht2a- and 5-ht2c-receptor blockade of asenapine may therefore provide a concerted and efficient means of
addressing negative symptoms compared with antagonism at either
receptor alone (meltzer et al., 2003). in addition, there are potential roles for 5-ht2a antagonism in enhancing cognition in schizophrenia and other disorders (roth et al., 2004a), and for 5-ht2c
antagonism in alleviating depressive symptoms (giorgetti and
tecott, 2004). the subnanomolar affinity of asenapine for these two
receptors, combined with a higher selectivity relative to d2 receptors, offers an opportunity to achieve high occupancy of 5-ht2a
and 5-ht2c receptors while maintaining adequate blockade of d2
receptors.
the potential advantages of high-affinity interactions between
asenapine and other 5-ht receptor subtypes remain to be explored,
although emerging evidence suggests that  xxxg1119xxx  blockade confers
improvement in cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia
(neale et al., 2005) and obesity (woolley et al., 2004; caldirola and
svartengren, 2005). in this context, the weak affinity that risperidone and quetiapine have for this receptor might offer an opportunity to test the consequence of such differentiation in patients. the
strong potency of asenapine in blocking the 5-ht7 receptor may
also confer clinical benefit, because this receptor subtype may play
a role in anxiety and mood regulation, as well as cognitive dysfunction (hedlund and sutcliffe, 2004; thomas and hagan, 2004;
guscott et al., 2005).
the ability of asenapine to interact potently with 2- and 1adrenergic targets could provide an additional mechanistic opportunity for improving cognitive and negative symptoms (2-blockade)
and may contribute toward efficacy for positive symptoms
(1-blockade) (svensson, 2003). the appreciable separation between
d3- and d2-receptor affinity seen with asenapine might also provide
a potential therapeutic benefit (schwartz et al., 2000; leriche et al.,
2004; joyce and millan, 2005). indeed, data from preclinical studies suggest that d3-receptor antagonism may help alleviate negative
and cognitive symptoms (joyce and millan, 2005). in addition,
genetic studies suggest a role for the  xxxg657xxx  in positive symptom response to antipsychotics (reynolds et al., 2005). recently,
in vivo studies have shown that combined blockade of d2/d3 receptors and 2a/2c receptors enhances glutamatergic transmission
in rat prefrontal pyramidal neurons, similar to that seen with clozapine, which may facilitate amelioration of cognitive impairment
(marcus et al., 2005).

asenapine: unique human receptor signature

with respect to adverse effect liability, the complex receptor
profiles of current atypical antipsychotics make interpretation of
receptor–tolerability associations difficult in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (nemeroff, 2003; roth et al., 2003;
dean and scarr, 2004). although excessive d2-receptor blockade is
clearly linked to a propensity for extrapyramidal symptoms and
hyperprolactinemia, it is not apparent which particular receptors or
receptor combinations are predictive of liability for antipsychotic
drug-induced weight gain, diabetes and cardiovascular adverse
events, although candidates include h1 and 1 (richelson and
souder, 2000). the high ratio of separation between d2 and all
muscarinic receptor subtypes with asenapine should minimize the
potential for antimuscarinic-related cognitive impairment and
peripheral adverse effects, such as insulin resistance (johnson
et al., 2005). of note, asenapine shows a lack of agonistic activity
at the  xxxg1114xxx ; 5-ht2b agonism has been linked to the
development of fibrotic valvular heart disease (horowski et al.,
2004).
in conclusion, asenapine has a unique human receptor signature
with high-affinity antagonism of serotonin, norepinephrine,
dopamine and histamine receptors. although all currently available
antipsychotic drugs have distinct receptor profiles, none fully
addresses the treatment needs of patients with schizophrenia, and
all have safety and tolerability issues. at doses occupying d2 receptors, asenapine is expected to display a stronger engagement of an
ensemble of 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c,  xxxg1119xxx , 5-ht7 and d3 receptors, and
2-adrenoceptors. whether the receptor signature and associated
pharmacology of asenapine will translate into therapeutic benefits
in the management of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder will be
determined by the outcomes of ongoing clinical trials.
