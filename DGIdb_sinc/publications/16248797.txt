abstract: the  xxxg456xxx  (achr) is the archetype of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel receptor
superfamily. noncompetitive antagonists inhibit the achr without interacting directly with agonist sites. among noncompetitive antagonists, general and local anesthetics have been used for decades to study the structure and function of
muscle- as well as neuronal-type achrs. in this review, we address and update all information regarding the characterization of binding sites and the mechanism of action for n-alkanols, barbiturates, inhalational and dissociative general anesthetics, as well as for tertiary and quaternary local anesthetics. the experimental evidence outlined in this review suggest that: (1) several neuronal-type achrs might be targets for the pharmacological action of distinct anesthetics; (2) the
molecular components of a specific anesthetic locus on a certain receptor type are different from the structural determinants of the site for the same anesthetic on a different receptor type; (3) there are unique binding sites for distinct anesthetics in the same receptor; (4) the affinity of a specific anesthetic depends on the achr conformational state; (5) anesthetics may inhibit achrs by different mechanisms including open-channel-blocking, augmenting the desensitization
process, and/or inactivating the opening of resting receptors; and (6) some anesthetics may potentiate achr activity.

i. introduction
the muscle-type  xxxg456xxx  (achr)
is the archetype of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel
(lgic) receptor superfamily which also includes the neuronal-type achr as well as type a and c gamma-aminobutyric
acid (gabaar and gabacr), glycine (glyr), and type 3
5-hydroxytryptamine ( xxxg1116xxx ) receptors (reviewed in [1,2]).
a scheme of the primary, tertiary, and quaternary structural
features of the cys-loop lgic superfamily is shown in [fig.
(1)].
these different receptors are considered a superfamily
because a high degree (∼30-70%) of homology between the
amino acid sequence of each receptor subunit exists [fig.
(1a)] (reviewed in [3]). a second characteristic, shared by
all members of this lgic superfamily, is that each subunit
can be divided in three domains: (1) an extracellular domain: the nh2-terminal hydrophilic extracellular portion
bears the neurotransmitter binding sites and several glycosylation sites. details of the neurotransmitter binding site for
the achr have been revealed at near atomic resolution using
the molluscan acetylcholine (ach)-binding protein (achbp)
[4,5]. molecular modeling of the extracellular portion of
both the alpha7 achr [6] and several gabaars [7] has recently been published. for instance, these studies have determined that each ach binding site is located at the interface of two subunits (reviewed in [1,5,8]). in addition, a 15residue cys-loop exists in the amino terminal, which gives
the name to this receptor superfamily; (2) a transmembrane
domain: each subunit is formed by four highly hydro*address correspondence to this author at the department of pharmaceutical sciences, college of pharmacy, western university of health sciences,

phobic segments designated m1, m2, m3, and m4 [fig.
(1b)]. the membrane-spanning region has a dimension of
30-35 å (∼40 å including the phospholipid headgroup portion). there is now considerable evidence supporting an alphahelix secondary structure for these transmembrane segments.
the segments m1, m2, and m3 are separated from each
other by short hydrophilic stretches. homologous faces of
the five m2 segments, one from each receptor subunit, form
the walls of the ion channel. the ion channels from
gabaar, gabacr, and  xxxg863xxx , are permeable to anions
(e.g., cl− and hco3−), whereas the ion channels from  xxxg1116xxx  and achrs allow the passage of cations (e.g., na+,
k+, and ca 2+). an excellent review on ion selectivity mechanisms has been recently published [8]. the m1, m3, and in
particular the m4 transmembrane segment of the achr are
in contact with the lipid membrane; and (3) a cytoplasmic
domain [fig. (1b)]: this hydrophilic portion is approximately four-fold smaller than the nh2-terminal domain, and
it is located between segments m3 and m4. the m4 segment
orientates the cooh-terminus to the synaptic side of the
membrane. the large cytoplasmic domain of these receptors
carries several phosphorylation sites that modulate receptor
function (reviewed in [9]). this domain is involved in biosynthesis, assembly, transport, clustering, and anchoring of
these receptors as well.
information on the structure of lgic superfamily members has come predominantly from studies of the muscletype achr. the muscle-type achr is a heteropentameric
membrane-embedded protein formed by four distinct
subunits. the adult muscle-type achr is in the stoichiometric ratio of alpha12beta1epsilondelta, whereas the combination alpha12beta1gammadelta predominates in embryonic or denervated muscle as well as in
electric organs from torpedo and electrophorus species.

close to position 192 and 193 of the torpedo  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit,
which participate in agonist/competitive antagonist binding,
the neuronal-type achr subunit classes are designated alpha (if
they contain both cys residues) and non-alpha or beta (if they do
not contain those cys residues). to date, nine neuronal alpha
subunits ( xxxg831xxx  to alpha10) and three beta subunits ( xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  to beta4) have
been identified in vertebrates (reviewed in [1,2,10]).

ion channel has a narrow strip of density no longer than two
rings of side-chains thick, the so-called gate (reviewed in
[17,18]).

by homology with the muscle-type achr, neuronal
achrs are also believed to form oligomers composed of
five subunits [11]. depending on the tissue of origin, achrs
can be combined in several subunit arrangements. there is
evidence supporting the existence of neuronal receptors
containing one, two, three, or even four different subunits
(reviewed in [1,10,12]). among homomeric receptors, there
are alpha7, alpha8 (identified only in avian species), and alpha9 receptors. heteromeric receptors have two nonequivalent agonist/competitive antagonist binding sites, whereas homomeric receptors [13] see [fig. (1c)] as well as achbp [4]
may have up to five sites. the existence of a high number of
structurally-distinct receptor entities, each with different
ligand sensitivities, suggests that each achr class may have
a distinct physiological function (reviewed in [10,14]).
the torpedo achr is believed to have the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -gamma- xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -delta- xxxg836xxx 
subunit anticlockwise arrangement (reviewed in [1,12,15]).
nevertheless, there is no direct evidence indicating the arrangement of neuronal subunits around the ion channel. the
organization  xxxg833xxx - xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx - xxxg833xxx - xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx - xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  has been suggested for the
predominate achr subtype present in the rat brain and the
arrangement  xxxg832xxx - xxxg834xxx -beta- xxxg832xxx -beta (where beta may be only beta4 or alternatively  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  or beta4) is presumed to exist in chicken ciliary
ganglion neurons, (reviewed in [1,12,16]).
cryo-electron microscopy image analysis at ~4 å resolution has helped elucidate the overall structure of the torpedo
achr (reviewed in [17,18]). viewed from the synaptic cleft,
the achr appears as a rosette 70-80 å in diameter with a
central depression ∼25 å wide. the five subunits are arranged pseudo-symmetrically around an axis that passes
through the ion pore, perpendicular to the plane of the lipid
membrane. the observed rosette is formed by the extracellular hydrophilic domain of the receptor containing both the
nh2- and the cooh-terminal [fig. (1)]. the nh2-terminus
of each subunit, formed by approximately 210 amino acids,
protrudes ~60 å toward the synaptic cleft. the observed
central depression is the vestibule, a large region located on
the extracellular domain of the achr connecting the extracellular medium with the ion channel proper.
the structure of the ion channel has been studied using
different methodological approaches including photoaffinity
labeling and site-directed mutagenesis in combination with
electrophysiological methods. in a simplistic manner, the ion
channel can be considered to be similar to a cylindrical tube
with a diameter of 20-25 å that protrudes along the lipid
bilayer see [fig. (1b)]. although the structural characteristics of the transmembrane portion of the channel have not
been resolved in detail, the narrowest portion of the cylinder
is considered to have a diameter of ∼7 å (reviewed in
[17,18]). the observed diameter is large enough to allow the
passage of na+ or k+ cations with a single hydration shell.
this evidence is in agreement with electron microscopic
image analyses at ~4 å resolution indicating that the closed

quaternary organization of the achr. each achr subunit includes:
(1) a long nh2-terminal hydrophilic extracellular domain; (2) four
highly hydrophobic domains named m1, m2, m3, and m4. it is
postulated that the intrinsic ion channel is composed by five m2
segments, one from each subunit. moreover, m1-m2 and m2-m3
are connected by minor hydrophilic stretches; and (3) a major hydrophilic segment facing the cytoplasm. additionally, the m4 domain orientates the cooh-terminus to the synaptic side of the
membrane. (c) schematic representation of the oligomeric organization of achr. the hypothetical pentameric achr is formed by
two alpha and three non-alpha subunits. the two ligand binding sites (l)
are located at the interfaces of one  xxxg216xxx  and one non-alpha chain.
regarding homomeric achrs (e.g., alpha7-alpha9) or for the molluscan
achbp, up to five ligand binding sites may exist.

anesthetics as chemical tools

additional evidence indicates that there are two categories of domains within the achr channel (reviewed in
[2,19,20]). there is an uncharged domain formed by a series
of different rings vectorially disposed from the extracellular
to the intracellular channel portion in the order: valine ring
(position m2-13), leucine ring (position m2-9), serine ring
(position m2-6), and threonine ring (position m2-2). in turn,
this uncharged portion is framed by two negatively-charged
regions: an anionic ring located at the extracellular portion of
the channel [i.e., the outer ring (position m2-20)] and two
more anionic rings [i.e., the intermediate ring (position –2)
and the inner ring (position –5)] located near the cytoplasmic
portion of the channel.
1. physiological and pathophysiological functions of
achrs
at the molecular level, achrs present a very simple
repertoire of functional properties. several lines of experimental evidence suggest that this receptor classes may exist
in a minimum of three interconvertible states (reviewed in
[1,2,21]). in the absence of the neurotransmitter ach, most
receptors are in the resting state, a closed but agonistactivatable state. thus, in the presence of ach or other agonists, the receptor is activated in the microsecond to millisecond range. this state represents an open ion channel with
low affinity for agonists relative to the desensitized state.
upon neurotransmitter binding, the intrinsically-coupled ion
channel opens, allowing ions to cross the lipid membrane
(i.e., na+ and ca2+ enter into the cell whereas k+ exits the
cell), and finally depolarizing the membrane. membrane
depolarization provokes specific physiological responses in
the cell. for instance, at the neuromuscular junction, if the
membrane depolarization is large enough, an action potential
is elicited. this action potential propagates from the neuromuscular junction all over the muscle fiber releasing ca2+
from intracellular stores. the final response in the muscle is
the contraction of its myofibrils. in neurons, the excitatory
signal provided by the activation of cation channels is summated with other signals, including inhibitory signals such as
those provided by the activation of either gabaars or
 xxxg863xxx , and subsequently re-directed to another neuron or to
an endocrine gland cell. in interneurons, activation of
achrs results in inward currents that depolarize the cell
increasing the frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic inhibitory currents (reviewed in [16]). considering that receptors exist on different cell types and achrs can be located at
distinct areas of the same cell, both excitatory and inhibitory
activities can be modulated in a complex manner.
neuronal-type achrs are involved in higher-order brain
mechanisms such as cognition, learning, memory, and behavior, as well as nociception and pain processing (reviewed
in [14,16,22,23]). presynaptic neuronal achrs are involved
in the release of neurotransmitters such as ach, glutamate,
norepinephrine, dopamine, 5-ht, or gaba. other functions
on the peripheral nervous system include auditory function
and development, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal actions, muscle contraction and tone. the malfunctioning of
these receptors has been considered as the origin of neurological disorders such as alzheimer’s and parkinson’s diseases, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, distinct congenital
myasthenic syndromes, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression,

453

chronic pain, as well as drug addiction (reviewed in [14,2224]).
in the prolonged presence of agonists, the activated receptor converts to a desensitized state. this state is refractory
to the pharmacological action of agonists, and the ion channel remains closed. in addition, the desensitized state has
high affinity for agonists and some antagonists. after the
dissociation of agonist molecules from their binding sites,
achrs in the desensitized state predominantly isomerize
directly to the resting state. the physiological role of the
desensitization process in the cys-loop receptor superfamily
has thus far not been determined. however, under some
pathological conditions the importance of this course of action becomes apparent (reviewed in [25]). for instance, activation and/or subsequent desensitization of neuronal achr
subtypes are believed to underlie behavioral addiction to
nicotine (reviewed in [24]).
ii. general anesthetics
an increasing amount of experimental information points
to the gabaar as one of the most important targets to induce general anesthesia. however, several neuronal-type
achrs are considered to be involved in certain additional
cns effects during general anesthesia such as amnesia, lack
of attention, behavioral states, and delirium (reviewed in
[2,16]). in general, general anesthetics (gas) act pharmacologically as noncompetitive antagonists (ncas) on distinct
achrs. in this regard, they can be used as chemical tools to
study the structure and function of achrs.
1. inhalational general anesthetics
several laboratories have shown that a series of inhalational gas including isoflurane,  xxxd1993xxx ,  xxxd2604xxx ,
halothane, and ether alter the kinetic properties, albeit with
distinct patterns, of the muscle-type (embryonic) achr expressed in the clonal cell line bc3h-1 at clinical or subclinical doses [26-29]. on the contrary,  xxxd3197xxx  inhibited
embryonic mouse muscle achr at concentrations higher
than clinical doses [30,31]. interestingly, both mouse and
bc3h-1 muscle receptors showed practically the same sensitivity to isoflurane [29]. table 1 summarizes the binding and
inhibition affinities of inhalational anesthetics for several
types of achrs. although these studies demonstrated that
inhalational anesthetics inhibit achrs in a noncompetitive
manner, there is no clear-cut evidence indicating if this inhibition is mediated by a steric (open-channel-blocking) and/or
an allosteric mechanism [28]. for instance, single-channel
and macroscopic current analyses suggest that isoflurane and
 xxxd3197xxx , as well as propofol bind to both open and closed
(resting) ion channels with equal affinity [29,30]. in addition, stopped-flow [32] and electrophysiology [27] experiments show that isoflurane increases the apparent affinity of
agonists to muscle-type achrs, suggesting that this ga
augmentates the desensitization rate.
in general, neuronal-type achrs are more sensitive to
the action of inhalational anesthetics than muscle-type
achrs (see table 1). for example, halothane inhibits different achrs with the following potencies (ic 50 values in µm):
alpha4beta2 (27 ± 5) > alpha2beta4 (47 ± 5) > alpha4beta4 (105 ± 17) > alpha1beta1gammadelta
(870 ± 50) [31]. the observed hill coefficients (nhs) are

454

current protein and peptide science, 2005, vol. 6, no. 5

close to unity suggesting one ga binding site per neuronaltype achr. however, studies on the macroscopic concentration-response curve for isoflurane inhibition of mouse
achr ion channels suggest the existence of more than one
binding site [29]. several anesthetics (e.g.,  xxxd2604xxx ,
 xxxd2599xxx , and etomidate) inhibit the receptors from bovine chromaffin cells, suggesting that these agents mediate
postsynaptic sympathetic inhibition by impairing epinephrine release from the adrenal glands [33]. several volatile
anesthetics including isoflurane,  xxxd1993xxx ,  xxxd2604xxx ,
and halothane also inhibit molluscan (ganglionic) achrs
[34].
it has been suggested that appropiate targets for anesthetic action should be affected by anesthetic drugs but not
affected by the new class of compounds called “nonimmobilizers” (nonanesthetics) [35]. the fact that nonimmobilizers
such as 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane and 2,3-dichlorooctafluorobutane have very little effect if any on several
neuronal-type achrs (e.g., alpha2beta4, alpha3beta4, and alpha4beta2) suggests
that these receptors might be involved in the mechanisms of
general anesthesia [36].
interestingly,  xxxg833xxx - [37] and  xxxg832xxx -containing receptors [38]
are more sensitive to the action of gas than alpha7 receptors
[39] (see table 1). since the isoflurane-induced inhibition of
the alpha7 receptor result was similar to that using receptor chimeras formed by the amino-terminal portion from the alpha7
receptor and the remainder from the  xxxg1116xxx  (see table 1),
the authors concluded that the ga binding domain should be
located at the amino-terminal domain of the alpha7 receptor
[39]. this conclusion correlates very well with that for the
localization of the ethanol binding site on the same receptor
class [40] (see section ii.2.b.). using homomeric  xxxg832xxx /alpha7 chimeras, an additional site that modulates (but does not participate directly in) halothane sensitivity was located at the
m2-m3 extracellular loop [38]. more specifically, muations
ile263met and val269ser in the chimera affected halothane
sensitivity.
one possible way to explain the mechanism of action of
gas on achrs is to determine its site(s) of action on the
protein by site-directed mutagenesis in combination with
electrophysiological recordings. this approach has helped to
demonstrate the existence of an inhibitory site for isoflurane
in the m2 transmembrane segment of the muscle-type achr
ion channel. more specifically, the double (because there are
two  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunits) alpha1ser252ile [41] and triple
alpha1ser252ala/beta1thr263ala mutation [29], which are located at
position m2-10, but not alpha1ser248ala/deltathr264ala that is located at position m2-6 (serine ring), increased the sensitivity
of the muscle achr to isoflurane (see table 1). interestingly, this site correlates very well with the inhibitory site for
long-alcohols (see section ii.2.a). the above results suggest
that the decrease in polarity provided by ala mutations at
position m2-10 increases isoflurane affinity for the resting
(closed) state without changing the affinity for the open
state. two other gas, ether and propofol, also present higher
affinity for closed achrs. in contrast, isoflurane has no
preference for the different conformational states of the wildtype achr. the binding site for the local anesthetic (la)
qx-222 is located between position m2-6 and m2-10 (see
section iii.2.a.). nevertheless the inhibitory action of isoflu-

arias and bhumireddy

rane, ether, or propofol was not changed by mutations at
position m2-6. thus, the ga binding domain partially overlaps the qx-222 locus. since qx-222 prefers the open channel, the aromatic moiety of the la and isoflurane should
interact distinctly with residues at position m2-10. this idea
is consistent with the results from dilger and vidal [26] indicating that ether stabilizes qx-222 binding. a plausible
localization for the isoflurane binding site that includes the
valine ring (position m2-13) was hypothesized by barann et
al. [42]. the fact that mutations on beta2val253, beta4phe255, and
alpha4val254, which are homologous residues at position m2-13,
determine isoflurane sensitivity but do not form its binding
site [43], does not support the above hypothesis. thus, more
experimental data will be necessary to clarify this issue.
another approach that has been used to localize inhalational anesthetic binding sites on the achr is the photoaffinity labeling method. [ 14c]halothane was the first ga used
for photoaffinity labeling purposes [44]. in this regard,
[14c]halothane specifically photoincorporates into purified
achrs with a kd value of 180 ± 40 µm (see table 1) and a
stoichiometry of 2.5 ± 0.4 binding sites per achr. although
isoflurane binds to torpedo achrs with a similar affinity
(see table 1), a stoichiometry of 9-10 binding sites per
achr was determined by 19f-nmr spectroscopy and gas
chromatography [45]. interestingly, the motion of isoflurane
is greatly restricted upon achr binding. [14c]halothane
photoincorporation shows no subunit preference, but the ga
probe preferably photolabeled the m1-m3 transmembrane
segments. although the authors hypothesize a lipid-protein
interface mode of interaction, electron paramagnetic resonance experiments demonstrated that isoflurane does not
perturb the interaction of the headgroup of phospholipids
with the achr [46]. thus, a more hydrophobic (closer to the
lipid membrane core) or luminal localization of the ga site
cannot be ruled out. finally, photoincorporation of
[14c]halothane to rat cerebellar homogenates yielded multiple pholabeled proteins [47]. this is in accord with the existence of more than just one protein target accounting for the
state of general anesthesia. more recently, [3h]azietomidate
was also synthesized and used for photoaffinity labeling of
torpedo achrs [48]. the results indicated that
[3h]azietomidate photolabeled both alpha and delta subunits, preferably in the m2 transmembrane domain, more specifically
at residues alphaglu262 and deltagln272 which are located in the extracellular mouth of the ion channel, as well as at residues
deltaser258 and deltaser262 which are located in the cytoplasmic end
of the ion channel. in addition, [3h]azietomidate photolabeled several amino acids within the agonist binding site at
both alphagamma and alphadelta subunit interfaces.
2. n-alkanol binding sites
although alkanols are not used clinically as gas, they
produce immobility, one of the main pharmacological properties elicited by gas. interestingly, their immobilizing potencies increase with increasing number of carbon atoms, but
only up to a certain chain length (e.g., c12), after which nalkanols with longer carbon chain decline in potency or remain equipotent with the preceding n-alkanol (reviewed in
[2,49]). in this regard, the “cutoff” can be defined as the
point at which the potency of the n-alkanol no longer increases with increasing carbon chain length. the existence of

an alcohol cutoff has been hypothesized to reflect the molecular volume of the alcohol binding site on a putative ion
channel target. unique cutoff values for diverse nicotinic
receptors may therefore reflect either differences in the size
of the ion channel pore or nonluminal alcohol binding pockets.
2a. long-chain n-alkanols
long-chain n-alkanols (e.g., from n-pentanol to ndodecanol) inhibit both muscle- [50,51] and neuronal-type
achr function [52,53] in a noncompetitive manner. muscletype achrs can also be inhibited by n- xxxd3026xxx  [51]. other
branched-chain alcohols (e.g., branched-chain pentanol analogs, 2-butene-1-ol, and 2-methyl-2- xxxd3026xxx ) inhibit achinduced currents of the human alpha2beta4 receptor as well [54]. in
this regard, molecular volume cutoff values for the inhibition
of alpha2beta4 (n-decanol, 234 å3), alpha4beta4 (≥  xxxd1922xxx ; 276 å3)
[52], alpha4beta2 (n-decanol; 234 å3) [53], and torpedo receptors
(≥ n-decanol; 340 å3) [51,55] were determined. depending
on the concentration range, n-butanol either potentiated or
inhibited ion channel function [53,54]. in addition to the
length of n-alkanols, other structural factors such as hydrophobicity, shape, and flexibility are important for the potency and efficacy of alkanols on the achr [54].
identification of ga binding sites, including those for
long-chain alcohols, using mutational studies is made all the
more difficult because of the highly allosteric nature of
achr and homologous receptors. discrete long-chain alcohol binding sites have been proposed to be either in the ion
channel or at the lipid-protein interface of the achr [56].
studies indicating a luminal site location are (reviewed in
[57], and references therein): (1) octanol inhibits preferentially the open state of the achr; (2) mutations in either the
segment m2-8/13 of the muscle-type  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit or at position m2-13 of neuronal  xxxg833xxx ,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , and beta4 subunits influence the
achr sensitivity to long-chain n-alkanols. this is in accord
with the evidence indicating that the octanol site does not
overlap the qx-222 locus [26] which is between position
m2-2 and m2-10 (see section iii.2.a.); (3) mutations at ser 252
(position m2-10) alter hexanol sensitivity in parallel with the
hydrophobicity of the side chain, suggesting a direct action
between protein side chains and alcohol molecules; (4) unequal but additive effects of mutations on other achr
subunits, suggesting asymmetry in subunit interactions with
alcohols; and (5) lack of effect of 1-hexanol in altering phospholipid headgroup interactions with the achr [46].
in site-directed mutation studies the issue often becomes:
do the amino acids identified as important for ga action
contribute to a binding site or are they involved in transducing the effect of the ga? to circumvent this issue, a photoreactive alcohol, 3-azioctanol, was developed. 3azioctanol is an effective ga, producing a loss of righting
reflex in tadpoles, potentiating gabaar currents, and inhibiting mouse muscle-type achr activation. equally important, 3-[3h]azioctanol is also an effective photoaffinity
reagent, photoincorporating in the torpedo achr in a specific and conformationally-selective fashion [58]. the principal site of 3-[3h]azioctanol photoincorporation in the torpedo achr was subsequently identified as glu262 within the
m2 segment of the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit. therefore, the primary bind-

arias and bhumireddy

ing site for long-chain alcohols was established to be located
in the outer or extracellular ring (position m2-20). interestingly, the same binding location for the la meproadifen was
determined using meproadifen mustard as a photoaffinity
labeling probe (see section iii.2.a.). while identification of
the 3-[ 3h]azioctanol binding site in the mouth of the channel
in the desensitized torpedo achr is an important milestone
in ga research, this finding points immediately to at least
one very important question: is a long-chain alcohol binding
site in the pore of lgic receptors compatible with potentation of channel conductance in lgic members such as the
gabaar and  xxxg1116xxx  or must an unique binding site mediating this effect exist in these receptors? in the case of glyr
and gabaar, long-chain alcohol binding sites have been
proposed to exist within cavities formed by the transmembrane segments of the subunits ([59]; reviewed in [2]). nevertheless, the most direct answer to this question awaits future studies aimed at identifying the site of 3-[3h]azioctanol
photoincorporation in these receptors.
2b. short-chain n-alkanols
ethanol (in the millimolar concentratrion range) and
other short-chain alcohols (e.g., methanol and  xxxd3026xxx ) enhance ach-induced currents in muscle- [51,60] and neuronal-type achrs [52-54,61,62]. this effect is opposite to
the action of long-chain n-alkanols (see previous section).
ethanol effect is probably mediated by stabilization of the
open ion channel [60] and/or by an increase in burst frequency [63]. nevertheless, nonhalogenated alkane anesthetics such as cyclopropane and butane [64] as well as acetaldehyde, a primary metabolite of ethanol found in brain homogenates [65], failed to potentiate both achrs and gabaars.
studying the effect of alkanols of similar molecular volume but with structural changes in the carbon backbone,
godden and dunwiddie [54] hypothesized that alcohol
molecules inducing potentiation of achr ion channel function require certain structural flexibility. on the other hand,
the alpha1ser252ile mutation at position m2-10, which changes
hydrophobicity but not size of the binding pocket, creates a
sensitive inhibitory site for ethanol without changing the
 xxxd102xxx induced gating modulation [60]. a mutation near the
agonist binding site increased the potentiating effect of ethanol without affecting its inhibitory effect [60]. interestingly,
ethanol also induces inhibition of alpha7 [40,62] and alpha3beta2 receptors [61]. the inhibition observed on alpha7 seems to be determined by the amino-terminal domain of the receptor [40].
these and the data from the previous section indicate
that: (1) multiple binding sites for n-alkanols, at least an inhibitory and an enhancing site, may exist on the receptor.
there are several reasons that support the existence of two
allosterically-linked alcohol binding sites: ethanol does not
compete sterically [43] but allosterically [53] with octanol
for the inhibitory site, and the differential free energy change
(for a review on thermodynamics of ligand-protein interactions see [20]) for the inhibitory effect is ~2-fold higher that
that for the potentiation effect [53]; (2) depending on the
receptor subtype the same alkanol may potentiate or inhibit
the achr; and thus (3), there is not only one cutoff but a
crossover from potentiation to inhibition [52].

anesthetics as chemical tools

3. the high-affinity barbiturate binding site
barbiturates, in addition to inducing general anesthesia,
exert a broad range of pharmacological actions including
sedation and muscle relaxation, as well as anticonvulsant and
anxiolytic effects [66]. although the consensus view is that
gabaars are the principal target for barbiturates (reviewed
in [2,49,66]), there is also evidence that these drugs may
inhibit neuronal-type achrs and this may contribute to the
pharmacological effect of barbiturates (reviewed in
[43,67,68]). barbiturate interaction with achrs is also
highly dependent on the conformational state of the receptor
([69,70]; reviewed in [2,71]). the cloning of multiple neuronal-type achr subunits has precipitated an explosion of
studies of barbiturate actions on recombinant receptors. table 2 summarizes the concentration range for barbiturate
binding to the resting, the open, and the desensitized state of
achrs from different origins.
pharmacologically, barbiturates act as ncas of achr
function (reviewed in [2,71,72]). although thiopental competitively inhibits the human alpha7 receptor [73], it noncompetitively inhibits neuronal receptors from chromaffin [74]
and pc12 cells [75]. previous studies have also demonstrated the presence of a stereoselective, functional binding
site on the achr ([76,77]; reviewed in [2,71]). however,
both alpha7 and alpha1beta1gammadelta receptors do not show stereoselectivity
to r(+) versus s(−) thiopental [73,77]. in addition, both convulsant [s(+)] and depressant [r(−)] enantiomers of 1methyl-5-phenyl-5-propyl barbituric acid (mppb) suppressed nicotine-induced currents in rat medial habenula
neurons and pc12 cells with practically the same potency
[67,78] (see table 2). these results suggest that there is no
correlation between the noncompetitive inhibition of neuronal-type achrs and the hypnotic or anticonvulsive effects
of barbiturates in vivo.
the results of equilibrium binding experiments using
torpedo achrs in the resting state demonstrate that
 xxxd158xxx  binds to a single high-affinity (kd = 3.7 µm; see
table 1) site [69]. based on the mutually exclusive nature of
barbiturate inhibition of 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125i] iodophenyl]diazirine
([125i]tid)
photoincorporation
and
3
[ h]tetracaine binding, this site is localized to the pore of the
achr ion channel [69]. from studies examining the inhibition of [ 125i]tid photoincorporation into the receptor by different barbiturates, by positional isomers of  xxxd158xxx , and
stereoisomers of pentobarbital and isobarbital, it is evident
that two basic characteristics dominate barbiturate interaction with the resting channel: (1) a minimal level of barbiturate hydrophobicity and (2) steric hindrance. with respect to
barbiturate hydrophobicity, shortening the 5’ chain of amylbarbital or  xxxd158xxx  by three carbons to produce  xxxd285xxx 
(5-ethyl, 5’-ethyl barbituric acid), reduces the hydrophobic
character of the barbiturate molecule and results in a >500fold reduction in potency for inhibition of [125i]tid photoincorporation or [14c] xxxd158xxx  binding ([69,70,79]) to the
resting achr. on the other hand, extending the length of the
chain at the 5-position by an extra carbon (−ch2−) converts
pentobarbital to  xxxd3183xxx , resulting in an increase in hydrophobicity as measured by the octanol/water partition coefficient but with no increase in potency for inhibition of
[125i]tid photoincorporation or [14c] xxxd158xxx  binding
[69,79]. in other words, high affinity binding to the achr

channel site requires that the barbiturate possesses a minimum level of hydrophobic character but once beyond that
threshold level increased hydrophobicity does not appear to
lead to increased binding affinity. the dramatic difference in
inhibition potencies between the positional isomers of
 xxxd158xxx  clearly points out that steric constraints plays a
significant role in barbiturate binding to the resting achr
channel. for example, by shifting the branch point on the 5’
chain of  xxxd158xxx  [5-ethyl, 5’-(3-methylbutyl) barbituric
acid] by one carbon closer to the pyrimidine ring [i.e., isobarbital; 5-ethyl, 5’-(2-methylbutyl) barbituric acid] the result is a >10-fold reduction in the potency of inhibition of
[14c] xxxd158xxx  or [3h]tetracaine binding, or [125i]tid
photoincorporation into the resting achr [69,79]. the role
of steric constraints in barbiturate binding to the resting
achr channel is further demonstrated by the approximately
2-fold differences in potency of inhibition between the r(+)
and s(-) enantiomers of pentobarbital and isobarbital (see
table 2).
competition binding and photolabeling studies argue
strongly that in the resting achr the high-affinity barbiturate binding site overlaps that for tetracaine and tid [69].
the binding sites for tid and tetracaine in the resting achr
channel have been extensively characterized [80-82]. tetracaine and tid bind to overlapping sites in the resting channel and for the smaller tid molecule that site is located between the highly conserved ring of leucine residues (m2-9;
e.g., deltaleu265) and the more extracellular ring of valine residues (m2-13; e.g., deltaval269). tid is similar in size to pentobarbital (or  xxxd158xxx ) and if we model pentobarbital complexed with the resting achr channel [see fig. (3)] we see
that the barbiturate pyrimidine ring fits nicely in the tid
binding site (defined by the segment between m2-9 and m213). if the barbiturate molecule is oriented such that the 5’
chain extends downward towards the intracellular end of the
channel, we see that the restriction in the lumen of the channel introduced by the leucine side-chains (m2-9) provides
steric hindrance to barbiturate binding depending on the conformation of the 5’ chain [fig. (3); cytoplasmic view]. we
propose that the dramatic difference in inhibition potencies
(i.e., binding affinity) between  xxxd158xxx  and either pentobarbital or isobarbital, results from either the ability of the 5’
chain of  xxxd158xxx  (or amylbarbital) to adopt a more extended conformation compared to pentobarbital (or isobarbital) or from the reduced rotational freedom of the side
chains of pentobarbital (or isobarbital). in either case the
branching on the 5’ chain of pentobarbital (or isobarbital)
results in a bulkier conformation that provides steric hindrance to the binding of the barbiturate because of the narrow crevice, i.e., channel lumen (diameter ~7 å), created by
the ring of the leucine side chains (m2-9) (reviewed in [17]).
in the achr resting state, we found that  xxxd158xxx  was
approximately 20-fold more potent than pentobarbital in
inhibiting either [14c] xxxd158xxx  or [3h]tetracaine binding
(see table 2), indicating a similar difference in binding affinity to the resting channel [69]. in contrast, the reported
inhibition constants for the open channel conformation indicate a much smaller difference (1.4-fold) in potency between
these two barbiturates [83]. although the observed discrepancy may be caused by the difference in the origin of the
used achr, preliminary electrophysiological experiments

the  xxxg216xxx  from torpedo achr using the clustal w program
[114]. then the aligned amino acid sequence from achr was
threaded onto the pdb coordinates of the backbone atoms of 1msl
using the homology module of insight 2000. the resulting pentameric model of the pore-lining segment of achr is shown
viewed from the synaptic cleft (top), from the plane of the membrane (middle), and from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane
(bottom). in order to better visualize phencyclidine and pentobarbital molecules (shown as space filling; cpk) within the pore, one
m2 segment from the side view is not displayed. a molecule of
phencyclidine is inserted above the valine ring (position m2-13;
depicted in grey) close to the extracellular ring (position m2-20;
depicted in yellow), according to [110,114]. a pentobarbital molecule is placed between the valine (position m2-13; depicted in grey)
and the leucine ring (position m2-9; depicted in blue), according to
[69]. the pyrimidine ring is positioned at about position m2-13,
whereas the 1-methylbutyl group of the 5’ chain of pentobarbital
(the hydrophilic tail) provides steric hindrance to pentobarbital
binding as a result of the restriction in the channel imposed by the
side-chains of residues at position m2-9.

performed in torpedo receptor-expressing cells suggest that
there is only a ~5-fold difference in channel-inhibition potency between  xxxd158xxx  and pentobarbital (reviewed in
[71]). the affinities of  xxxd158xxx  for the open channel of
the torpedo achr is clearly similar to its affinity for the
resting state, but both affinities are higher than that for the
desensitized state [69]. on the contrary, pentobarbital exhibits a stronger preference for the open channel state than for
either the resting or desensitized state [70,76]. there is very
little information pertaining to the location of the barbiturate
binding site in the open channel. one study [83], in which
the triple mutation ser252ala (on both  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunits) and
thr265ala (on the  xxxg836xxx  subunit) decreased by 3.5-fold the dissociation rate constant of the local anesthetic qx-222 and by
3-fold the ic50 value for procaine, but resulted in no effect
on  xxxd158xxx -induced inhibition, suggests that the barbiturate binding site is not located between position m2-6 and
m2-10 in the open channel. in addition, site-directed
mutagenesis studies suggest that although homologous
amino acids beta2val253, beta4phe255, and alpha4val254 at position
m2-13 determine the differential sensitivity to pentobarbital
between the neuronal-type alpha4beta2 and alpha4beta4 receptor, it is
unlikely that these residues form the barbiturate site proper
[43].
4. binding sites for dissociative anesthetics

although the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar)
and the achr are not genetically related, they share certain
pharmacological properties such as the noncompetitive inhibition elicited by a number of different dissociative anesthetics including pcp and its structural analogue thienylcyclohexylpiperidine (tcp), ketamine, and dizocilpine (reviewed in [2,19,20,49,71]). it is possible that these drugs
have a similar mode of action on both achr and nmdartype. dissociative anesthetics are a special group of general
anesthetics that provoke profound analgesia, amnesia, immobility, and hypnosis. as a pernicious side effect, they produce dysphoria, psychomotor activity, hallucinations, or dellirium that limit their usefluness as clinical anesthetics.

4a. the high-affinity dizocilpine binding site
while dizocilipine is reported to be an open-channel
blocker of alpha4beta2 neuronal nicotinic achrs [84], studies examining the mechanism of receptor inhibition [85] as well as
the lack of stereoselectivity for its inhibition of alpha7 achrs
[86] suggest that dizocilpine inhibition may not simply result
from steric blockade of open-channel achrs. in this regard
and to localize the dizocilpine binding site(s) on the muscletype achr, we used three different experimental strategies
[87]. first, we determined the kd and the number of binding
sites of [3h]dizocilpine when the receptor is in the desensitized or in the resting state. secondly, we calculated the apparent ki of dizocilpine from binding displacement experiments using ncas that bind to different high-affinity sites
on the achr when it is in the desensitized or resting conformational state, respectively. third, we partially resolved
the structural components for dizocilpine action on the
achr by photoaffinity labeling and subsequent protease
degradation and amino-terminal sequence analysis.
from the first set of experiments, we found that there is
one (0.72 ± 0.05 binding site/achr) high-affinity (kd = 4.8
± 1.0 µm) dizocilpine locus in the desensitized achr, and
several (3-6) low-affinity (∼140 µm) binding sites in the
resting achr (table 3). the high-affinity kd value is in the
same concentration range as that found for dizocilpineinduced inhibition of either agonist-induced ion channel
opening [88] or of the potent nca [3h]histrionicotoxin
([3h]htx) binding in the desensitized state [89] (see table
3).
taking into account the observed kis for dizocilpine obtained from displacement of achr-bound fluorescent ncas
such as quinacrine, ethidium, or crystal violet (crv) from its
respective high-affinity binding site on the achr, we suggest that dizocilpine specifically inhibits the binding of quinacrine or crv to desensitized achrs or the binding of crv
to achrs in the resting state [87]. since ethidium binding is
located within the ion channel [90,91], and ethidium binding
is only inhibited by dizocilpine at very high concentrations,
we conclude that the dizocilpine binding site is not located in
the ion channel lumen. on the other hand, schild-type analyses indicate that dizocilpine inhibition of crv binding when
the achr is in the desensitized or resting conformational
state is mediated by an allosteric mechanism [87]. although
there is presently no direct evidence for a luminal localization, indirect evidence (i.e., crv specifically displaced the
high-affinity nca pcp) suggests a luminal ion channel localization of the crv binding site [92]. again, the experimental evidence suggests that the dizocilpine binding site is
not located in the ion channel when the achr is in either the
desensitized or resting conformational state. 3,4,5trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)octyl ester (tmb8)-induced inhibition of [3h]- or [125i]-dizocilpine binding
also supports this conclusion [87]. the fact that the n h values
obtained from these experiments were less than one (0.62 ±
0.05 and 0.50 ± 0.05, respectively) suggests that tmb-8
inhibits [ 3h]dizocilpine binding by an allosteric mechanism.
the pharmacological action of tmb-8 on muscle- and neuronal-type achrs is believed to be mediated by ion flux
inhibition upon binding to the ion channel [84,93,94].

arias and bhumireddy

schild-type analyses also indicate that the inhibition of
quinacrine binding is probably mediated by a steric mechanism. the fact that quinacrine-induced inhibition of
[3h]dizocilpine binding shows a nh close to one also suggests a steric mode of inhibition. considering that the highaffinity binding site for quinacrine (reviewed in [19,20]) is
located apart from the ion channel [95], probably in a nonannular lipid domain of the desensitized achr [96] ∼12 å
from the lipid-water interface [97], we may tentatively infer
that the high-affinity dizocilpine binding site is located in a
nonannular lipid domain close to the quinacrine locus. the
exact location for the nonannular lipid domain on the achr
is unkown. however, indirect determinations have suggested
that this domain may be located either between the five
subunits of the achr and/or between crevices existing
within the four transmembrane segments (m1-m4) from
each subunit (reviewed in [12,19,71]). moreover, previous
experiments indicated that quinacrine binding to desensitized
achr is sensitive to the action of  xxxd2154xxx  such as stearic
acid and its 5-doxyl derivative [96,98]. thus, further experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that dizocilpine binding site overalps the quinacrine locus. we observed
that the maximal binding of [3h]dizocilpine was not affected
by stearic and  xxxd208xxx  at concentrations higher than
1 mm (unpublished results). this suggests that in fact the
dizocilpine binding site is close to the quinacrine locus but
apart from the fatty acid domain.
in the third set of experiments we found that
[125i]dizocilpine photoincorporates into each achr subunit,
although principally into the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit. within the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx 
subunit the vast majority of [125i]dizocilpine labeling maps to
the transmembrane segment m1 and m4, demonstrating that
dizocilpine binds at the lipid-protein interface of the receptor
[99], a result consistent with the lipophilic nature of the
dizocilpine molecule. however, several results indicate that
some or all of the [125i]dizocilpine labeling in the transmembrane segments m1 and m4 may not result from interaction
with the high-affinity radioligand binding site on the receptor
but with low-affinity sites at the lipid-protein interface.
dizocilpine binding to its high-affinity site on the desensitized state may result in only a very small component of specific photoincorporation that is masked by a much larger
component of nonspecific labeling at the receptor lipidprotein interface. on the other hand, we demonstrated that
there was no radioactivity associated with a fragment containing the m2 transmembrane segment of the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit, a
result that argues against a luminal binding site for dizocilpine. however, our pharmacological experiments demonstrate that dizocilpine sterically competes for the quinacrine
binding site when the achr is in the desensitized state. in
this regard, previous photolabeling experiments using quinacrine azide demonstrated that the quinacrine binding site is
located in the m1 transmembrane segment of the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit
at residues arg209 and pro211 [100]. in addition to these
amino acids, site-directed mutagenesis experiments included
the residue alpha1tyr213 as another component of the quinacrine
binding site [101]. in contrast, hydrophobic photolabeling
studies implicate residue pro211 in alpha1m1 as being situated at
the lipid-protein interface [99]. our results establish
[125i]dizocilpine photoincorporation into the alpha1m1 segment;
therefore, one possibility is that residues within m1 contrib-

ute to both the lipid-protein interface of the achr as well as
to the high-affinity dizocilpine binding site.

caine, but an allosteric interaction between ketamine/tcp/pcp and tid/barbiturate. more specifically:

finally, the fact that dizocilpine binds the achr closed
channel with 5.3-fold higher affinity than for the open channel form is inconsistent with an open-channel-blocking
mechanism [85,102], but supports our conclusion that the
high-affinity dizocilpine binding site is located at a nonluminal site in the desensitized achr. in this regard, our results
are in agreement with an allosteric mode of inhibition for
dizocilpine on the muscle-type achr.

(1) ketamine, tcp [110], and pcp [111] increased the
extent (i.e., potentiated) of [125i]tid photoincoporation into
achr. along these lines, previous photolabeling experiments have demonstrated that the effect of pcp is to subtly
shift the orientation of the tid molecule within its resting
channel binding site [112]. we conclude from these results
that these dissociative anesthetics interact allosterically with
tid, and that neither ketamine nor pcp (or tcp) binds between position m2-9 and m2-13, the established binding
locus for tid within the resting achr channel (see also
[112]). consistent with this conclusion, mutations at
beta2val253 and alpha4val254 (position m2-13) do not produce any
effect on ketamine-induced inhibition of alpha4beta2 neuronal-type
achr channels [68].

certain neuronal-type achrs might be involved in
dizocilpine-induced anesthesia. various neuronal-type
achrs are inhibited by dizocilpine at concentrations that
depend on the receptor type ranging from 1 to 36 µm
[68,84,86,89,103]. table 3 summarizes the dizocilpine affinities for different achr subunits. specifically, receptors
containing beta4 subunits were more sensitive to dizocilpine
than those containing  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  subunits, and  xxxg832xxx -composed receptors were more sensitive than those containing the  xxxg831xxx ,  xxxg833xxx , or
alpha7 subunit [68,86].
4b. high-affinity pcp/ketamine binding sites
dissociative anesthetics such as pcp [104] and ketamine
[105] inhibit several neuronal-type achrs at clinical concentration ranges. thus, there exists the possibility that these
compounds are in fact pharmacological determinants of dissociative anesthesia by affecting neuronal achrs. one approach to understand how these compounds work is to determine the localization of its binding site(s). in this regard,
photoaffinity labeling experiments using [3h]azido-pcp
have mapped the high-affinity pcp site on both the resting
and desensitized achr to a proteolytic fragment containing
the transmembrane segments m1-m2-m3 [106]. in the muscle-type achr open channel, the pcp binding site is believed to be located between the conserved ring of leucine
residues (position m2-9) and the more cytoplasmic ring of
serine residues (position m2-6) ([108]; reviewed in
[19,71,107]) [see fig. (3)]. this is consistent with the fact
that pcp prevents photoincorporation of the high-affinity
ncas chlorpromazine (cpz) to amino acids located at the
threonine (position m2-2), serine (position m2-6), and
leucine (position m2-9) ring [20]. however, a more complex
process involving nonluminal inhibitory and regulatory sites
for pcp has been hypothesized as well [108].
ketamine competitively inhibits binding of both [3h]pcp
[109] and its analog [3h]tcp [110] when the receptor is in
the resting or desensitized conformation. given the competitive nature of the interaction between ketamine and [3h]tcp
or [3h]pcp for binding to the achr and the structural similitude between ketamine, tcp, and pcp, it is likely that
these dissociative anesthetics bind to a single or overlapping
binding site. in order to characterize and potentially localize
the binding site for the dissociative anesthetics ketamine and
pcp in the resting achr, we have taken into consideration
previous studies that have established the binding sites for
the well-known ncas tid [80,82], tetracaine (see section
iii.2.b.), and barbiturates (see section ii.3.) in the resting
achr channel. our results yielded what appear to be conflicting conclusions: a mutually exclusive (competitive) interaction between ketamine/tcp/barbiturate/tid and tetra-

(2) ketamine does not produce any effect on
[14c] xxxd158xxx  binding and the s(+) enantiomer of ketamine alone and tcp only slightly inhibit [14c] xxxd158xxx 
binding and with nh values that deviate significantly from
unity (nh = 0.22-0.32). reciprocally,  xxxd158xxx  inhibits
[3h]tcp binding only marginally and again with a nh value
that is far from unity. these results are consistent with an
allosteric interaction, if any, between s(+)ketamine/tcp and
 xxxd158xxx , and that ketamine and tcp do not bind at the
barbiturate binding locus within the resting achr channel.
since the barbiturate binding site overlaps with that for tid
[69], these results are in agreement with the previous conclusion.
(3) ketamine, tcp [108] and pcp [113] completely inhibit [ 3h]tetracaine binding to the resting achr and the results strongly suggest a competitive, mutually exclusive interaction. in reciprocal fashion, our experiments indicate that
tetracaine inhibits [3h]tcp binding by a mutually exclusive
(steric) mechanism, and that ketamine and tcp interact
competitively. collectively, the evidence demonstrates that
these dissociative anesthetics bind to a single or overlapping
sites on the resting achr, and suggests that the ketamine/tcp/pcp binding site partially overlap the tetracaine
site, which is located approximately between positions m216/17 and m2-5 [112] in the resting achr channel.
these apparently conflicting conclusions can be reconciled by proposing the following: the extended conformation of the tetracaine molecule is longer than either the tid
or barbiturate molecule [81], therefore there are at least two
possibilities of how the ketamine (or pcp or tcp) molecule
may be accommodated within the resting ion channel in order to partially overlap with the tetracaine binding site but
allosterically interact with the tid/barbiturate locus. one
possibility is that the ketamine (or pcp or tcp) binding site
is located closer to the carboxyl terminal end of the m2
transmembrane segment (more extracellular, above m2-13
and closer to m2-20). based on several lines of reasoning
and the pattern of [3h]tetracaine photoincorporation into m2containing amino acids gallagher and cohen [81], positioned the tetracaine molecule within the resting achr
channel such that the dimethylaminoethyl group is in approximate register with m2-5 whereas its n-butyl group is
aligned with hydrophobic residues toward the carboxylterminus of the m2 segment (e.g., m2-16/17). because the

anesthetics as chemical tools

tetracaine molecule extends above m2-13, it therefore spatially overlaps the ketamine (or pcp or tcp) molecule, and
this accounts for the competitive interaction between ketamine (or pcp or tcp) and tetracaine. in this regard, the
model in fig. (3) illustrates how pcp (or tcp or ketamine)
and  xxxd158xxx  (or tid) may bind simultaneously within
the resting ion channel.
newer structure-function relationship experiments using
a series of adamantane derivatives to inhibit [3h]tcp binding in both the resting and the desensitized state brought
some light on the structure of the tcp binding site [114]. for
instance, the results indicate that the tcp binding site in the
resting state is very wide and that this locus does not impose
any important structural restriction for binding except that
the amino group on the adamantane derivative is necessary
for full binding. on the contrary, a sharp correlation between
molecular size or hydrophobicity versus ki values was obtained in the desensitized state. this suggests that the tcp
locus in the desensitized state is structurally different from
the site in the resting state. one possibility is that the site for
tcp in either state is located at different places within the
ion channel: in the resting state, the tcp locus is located
above position m2-13 and close to position m2-20, whereas
in the desensitized state, this site is located between position
m2-6 and m2-9 ([108,110,114]; reviewed in [19,71,107]).
thus, in order to construct a molecular modeling of the pcp
binding site in the resting state [see fig. (3)], the amino acid
sequence of the pore-lining alpha-helix of the homopentameric
mechanosensitive receptor (1msl) was aligned with the sequence of m2 of the torpedo  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit [114]. then, the
aligned amino acid sequence from achr was threaded onto
the pdb coordinates of the backbone atoms of 1msl. in this
regard, fig. (3) shows the binding domain of pcp in the
resting state close to the mouth of the ion channel where a
ring (extracellular or outer) of anionic residues is located at
position m2-20. it is interesting to denote that the resting ion
channel contains at least two allosterically-linked binding
sites, one for pcp/tcp/ketamine and the other for
tid/barbiturates.
finally, it is noteworthy that ketamine inhibited [3h]tcp
binding to the resting and desensitized achr in an apparently nonstereoselective manner [110]. this result is in
agreement with the nonstereoselectivity inhibition of the
open ion channel expressed in pc12 cells by ketamine isomers [115]. supporting a nonstereoselective binding site for
dissociative anesthetics is the fact that dexoxadrol and
levoxadrol (pcp-like compounds) have no stereospecificity
for inhibition of the nicotine-induced catecholamine secretion in adrenal chromaffin cells [116]. nevertheless, these
conclusions contrast with the fact that s(+)ketamine is nearly
4-fold more potent to inhibit ganglionic neuronal-type
achrs [117] (see table 3), 3-4 times better analgesic [118],
1.5-4 times better hypnotic [118,119], and 1.5-fold more
potent in reducing ach-induced neuronal excitation [120]
than r(−)ketamine. the observed stereoselectivity argues in
favor of the involvement of certain (but not all) neuronaltype achrs in the anesthetic (or perhaps psychological
and/or psychomotor) action of ketamine. the clinicallyrelevant concentration of ketamine in free plasma is 4-7 µm
[121], and this concentration range is close to the ic50 values

463

for certain neuronal-type achrs (see table 3). thus, this
correlation also supports the above conclusion.
iii. local anesthetics
the inhibitory action of las on nerve conduction, the socalled local anesthesia, is primarily mediated by blocking
voltage-gated na + channels. experimental evidence supports
the conjecture that las may act on several voltage-gated and
ligand-gated ion channels from the cns as well. la effects
in the cns include sedation, tremors, dysphoria, convulsions, and coma. among lgics, neuronal-type achrs are
possible targets for the action of las in the cns.
1. mechanism of action
the early use of electrophysiological techniques such as
voltage jump relaxation and agonist-induced noise spectra
analysis demonstrated that las depress synaptic transmission by inhibiting the achr (reviewed in [12,15]). these
and subsequent studies on single-activated ion channels from
both muscle- and neuronal-type achrs supported the notion
that the pharmacological action of las is elicited upon
binding to the ion channel. like other ncas (reviewed in
[19]), las exert their blocking action on achrs reducing
the duration of ion channel open time without changing
maximal agonist binding. however, the mechanism of channel inhibition is still a matter of controversy. experimental
evidence supports the idea of channel blocking by a steric
mechanism in which the drug enters into the lumen channel,
binds and plugs it like a cork in a bottleneck. one of the earliest pieces of evidence supporting a steric mode of action
was provided by voltage-clamp experiments where the inhibitory action of las, like other ncas, was shown to be
modulated by membrane potential changes (reviewed in
[12,15]). although almost all las are considered to be voltage-sensitive, uncharged las (e.g.,  xxxd305xxx  and  xxxd1869xxx ; [122]) and the unprotonated forms of all other las are
voltage-insensitive because they cannot be expelled from the
channel at positive potentials. in most cases, the inhibitory
effect of quaternary las is more sensitive to membrane potential than the effect elicited by tertiary las. the potentiation of la inhibition of transient agonist-evoked currents by
membrane hyperpolarization can be quantified by calculating
the e-fold change in the apparent ic50 value of the la under
study. in general, e-fold change values range from 26 mv for
qx-222 in the neuronal alpha4beta2 subtype [123] to 122 mv for
procaine in parasympathetic neurons from rat intracardiac
ganglia [124]. in addition, the observed values depend on
both the la and the achr type. for instance, considering
the same receptor class (e.g., rat alpha4beta2 expressed in xenopus
oocytes), the e-fold change is 26 mv for qx-222 [121] or 90
mv for (-)cocaine [125]; whereas, considering the same la
(e.g., procaine) the values range from 50 [126] to 122 mv
[124] for the muscle- and neuronal-type achr, respectively.
taking into account the apparent voltage-sensitive location
of las, the main conclusion is that las bind at a site within
the electrical field, presumably the ion channel. more specifically, the binding site for qx-222 [123,124,127-130] and
qx-314 [131] may be located closer to the cytoplasmic side
of the receptor, whereas the procaine locus is near the middle
of the ion channel [124,126,132], and the binding sites for ()cocaine [133],  xxxd383xxx  [134,135] and piperocaine me-

464

current protein and peptide science, 2005, vol. 6, no. 5

thiodide [136] are much closer to the extracellular side of the
receptor. nevertheless, the qx-222 site location in the
achr ion channel from parasympathetic neurons [124]
seems to be more external than in both alpha12beta1gammadelta [127-130]
and alpha4beta2 [123] subtypes.
on the basis of the experimental results described above
and additional observations, the open-channel-blocking
mechanism was postulated (reviewed in [12,15]). although a
great body of information supports the existence of an openchannel-blocking mechanism, deviations from this simple
mechanism have been observed. for example, a cyclic model
where the anesthetic binds to closed channels has also been
suggested [126]. this evidence is in accord with the existence of an allosteric inhibitory mechanism. the interaction
between the closed (e.g., resting, monoliganded, or
biliganded) receptor and the ligand induces a conformational
change on the protein preventing the opening of the ion
channel and thus, depressing ion flux activity. an approach
that allows us to distinguish between the two open-channelblocking and allosteric mechanisms is determining the effect
of las on both apparent channel opening and closing rate
constants. if the open-channel-blocking is the main inhibitory mechanism, then, only the apparent rate constant for
channel closing should decrease as la concentration is increased. on the contrary, if the allosteric mechanism is the
principal mechanism of inhibition, then, both apparent rate
constants should decrease as the la concentration increases.
utilizing fast kinetic techniques, hess and coworkers, demonstrated that both apparent channel opening and closing rate
constants decreased with increasing procaine concentrations,
suggesting the existence of a regulatory site to which the la
binds before the channel opens [137]. the allosteric mechanism establishes that las bind to a regulatory site on the
achr, inhibit channel opening, and decrease the achr in
the open state by a slow course that converts to receptors in
the active form. in other words, procaine preferably binds to
the closed channel (anr) forming the anrl complex and
thus, inhibiting ion flux (anr’l). in addition, tetracaine prefers the achr in the resting state (r) forming the rl complex which reduces the conversion to the open channel
(r’l). in the case of (-)cocaine, the rate of channel opening
is not affected but the rate of channel closing is slightly (1.5fold) increased [138]. the affinity of (-)cocaine for the open
channel is 6-fold lower than that in the closed state (see table 4). nevertheless, with the dissociative anesthetic dizocilpine (a drug that has been used as a palliative on cocaine
addiction) the closing rate constant increases with increasing
inhibitor concentration, whereas the opening rate constant
does not change [102]. these results are consistent with a
two step mechanism: first, (-)cocaine or dizocilpine rapidly
binds to a regulatory site on the closed channel (anr) without affecting ion channel properties. in this regard, the ion
channel might open with the drug bound (anr*l). next, the
achr-bound inhibitor complex (anrl) is slowly (t1/2 ∼ 70
ms) transformed to a non-conducting state (anr’l). alternatively, las may also bind to open channels with the subsequent inhibition of ion flux. in particular, the quaternary la
qx-222 binds preferably to the open channel (anr*) forming the anr*l complex and thus, inhibiting ion flux
(anr’l). probably, this latter mechanism is more important
for quaternary than for tertiary las. since the channel

arias and bhumireddy

should be open before the la inhibits it, the short time that
the channel remains open will be enough for the initiation of
the membrane depolarization process. thus, the physiological implication of this mechanism is not obvious. the allosteric mechanism seems to be more significant for the inhibitory action of tertiary las. the existence of this regulatory
mechanism may be of physiological relevance: the binding
of an inhibitor to its regulatory site before the channel is
open may ultimately preclude the signal transmission between cells. in turn, this perturbation of neurotransmission
might be involved, at least partially, with the behavioral effects observed for (-)cocaine and their analogues including
las. in this regard, the search for alternative drugs to alleviate the consequences of abusive use of cocaine and other
derivatives should take into account a molecular structure
that may compete for the cocaine site without producing its
inhibitory effect.
2. high-affinity local anesthetic binding sites
in addition to low-affinity la binding sites at the lipidprotein interface ([139,140]; reviewed in [12,15]), there exist
specific high-affinity la binding sites which are displaced
by other high-affinity ncas. the evidence that high-affinity
las present a stoichiometry of one binding site per functional achr was determined by equilibrium binding of radiolabeled las such as meproadifen, trimethisoquin, tetracaine, as well as by 5-azido trimethisoquin photolabeling.
averaging all the experimental values, a stoichiometric ratio
of 0.79 ± 0.37 la binding site per achr is calculated (reviewed in [12,15]). this ratio, which is close to unity, is
similar to other high-affinity ncas (reviewed in [19]).
las discriminate among different achr conformational
states: resting, open, and desensitized (reviewed in [12,15]).
for instance, the decrease in the kds in the presence of agonists, is consistent with the preferential binding of las to the
desensitized achr. however, some las (e.g., procaine) do
not have any preference with respect to the resting or the
desensitized achr, whereas others (e.g., tetracaine and
piperocaine) prefer the achr in the resting state. in addition, some quaternary las (e.g., qx-222) bind better the
achr in the open conformational state.
interestingly, the affinity of las for muscle achrs
seems to be different to that from neuronal achrs, and they
also discriminate between distinct neuronal-type achrs
(table 4). in particular, procaine has a lower kd for the receptor found in parasympathetic neurons [124] than that for
other receptors. on the contrary, qx-222 binds the alpha4beta2
receptor with affinities one order of magnitude lower than
other achrs at the same voltage membrane (e.g., -90 mv;
[123]). in addition, (-)cocaine has a lower ic50 value for the
alpha4beta4 receptor than for other neuronal-type achrs [125].
the observed differences in affinities (table 4) conjointly
with the distinctions in voltage sensitivity existent among
las on several achrs might help to identify the structural
components involved in the la binding site.
one of the most important techniques used to discern the
localization of high-affinity la binding sites is the photoaffinity labeling approach. this can be achieved using radiolabeled las that can be directly activated by uv light, or using other photoactivatable derivatives with specific photore-

active groups. the specificity of the photoaffinity labeling
experiments followed the criteria: (a) existence of a positive
displacement elicited by other known high-affinity ncas,
(b) enhancement of affinity and thus labeling of the la under study (but not for all) in the presence of agonists, and (c)

inhibition of the agonist effect by competitive antagonists
such as  xxxd2511xxx  (alpha-btx).
one of the first labeling experiments to localize the la
binding site was performed using different azido la derivatives (reviewed in [12,15]). the azido-procainamide deriva-

anesthetics as chemical tools

tive only labeled the achr  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit, whereas the 5azido[3h]trimethisoquin derivative labeled the  xxxg219xxx  in a
htx- and cch-sensitive fashion. the same basic pattern
was observed using [3h]trimethisoquin and simple uv irradiation [141,142]. similar results were observed using other
tritiated ncas (reviewed in [19]). the la analog meproadifen mustard, as well as other ncas, also labeled the
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and  xxxg218xxx  [143].
2a. binding sites for quaternary local anesthetics
the outer or extracellular ring is the labeling site for the
potent la derivative meproadifen mustard. meproadifen
mustard was initially found in a fragment beginning at ser173
of the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit. more precisely, the meproadifen derivative labeled the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit at position glu 262 [143]. based on
the four transmembrane achr structural model [see fig.
(1)], there is consensus that this ring of negative charges is
located between the synaptic membrane and the extracellular
domain of the achr (the m2-m3 loop, closer to m2),
probably at or near the internal mouth of the channel [fig.
(3)]. interestingly, these results indicate that the la meproadifen (and probably its tertiary analog proadifen) shares
the same binding locus as ga alcohols (see section ii.2.a.).
the side chains of photolabeled amino acids such as
alpha1ser248 for the neuroleptic cpz and alpha1glu262 for the la
meproadifen should be approximately 15 å apart each other.
this fact provides support for the extension of the early hypothesis of only one locus for structurally-unrelated highaffinity ncas to the existence of several binding sites for
different ncas all located into the channel lumen (reviewed
in [12,19]).
meproadifen, as well as other las, shifts the equilibrium
to the desensitized state (see table 4). this was evidenced
when the labeling of alpha1tyr93, an amino acid involved in the
agonist/competitive antagonist binding site at the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit
(reviewed in [1]), elicited by the irreversible antagonist pn,n-(dimethylaminoi)phenyldiazonium fluoroborate was
augmented in the presence of meproadifen. this experimental evidence suggests that this residue is more accessible to
labeling when the achr is in the desensitized state.
the localization of the qx-222 binding site was proposed on the basis of site-directed mutagenesis and patchclamp studies ([129]; reviewed in [12,15]). for instance, the
pharmacological activity of the open-channel blocker qx222 is affected when the serine ring (position 6) is mutated.
the drug presented shorter time in the achr-bound state
and its kd was augmented when the polar amino acid
alpha1ser248 was mutated to ala, a nonpolar amino acid. in
comparison, the deltaser262ala mutation also affected these
properties but in an extent two times lower than the one detected in the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit. this effect can be interpreted in the
light of difference in the number of residues mutated (there
are two  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunits per each delta). a double mutation (actually
a triple mutation) produced an additive effect on the kd of
qx-222. however, the observed lifetime (1.5 ms) for qx222 in the wild type achr is similar (1.2 ms) to that obtained in the double mutated [129]. additional mutations on
position 2 produce a similar pattern as that observed by mutations on position 6, however, the effect on the qx-222 kd
was small. in contrast with the experimental evidence on

serine ring mutations, when alpha1ser252 (position 10, located
one residue apart from the leucine ring) was mutated to ala,
both the affinity of qx-222 and the lifetime of the achrqx-222 complex were enhanced. the increased affinity was
principally due to a decrease in the dissociation rate constant
values and it was not affected by voltage membrane changes
[129]. mutations beta1phe259ser and alpha1ser252ala on the
alpha12beta1delta2 (gamma-less) receptor showed similar relative effect of
qx-222 blockade as in the alpha12beta1gammadelta receptor [128]. the
thr264pro mutation in the epsilon subunit, which has been implicated as responsible of one of the congenital myasthenic
syndromes (reviewed in [12,15]), only slightly affects the
inhibitory property of qx-222 [144]. thus, thr264, which is
located close to the valine ring, may not be involved in the
qx-222 binding site. in addition, qx-222 produced the
same effect on both adult (alpha12beta1epsilondelta) and embryonic
(alpha12beta1gammadelta) muscle-type achrs (see table 4). considering
that the structural determinants that account for the functional differences between both channels are located at the
m3-m4 loop, the m4 segment, and the extracellular portion
of both channels, the qx-222 locus should be positioned
neither in the extracellular nor cytoplasmic hydrophilic portions nor in the m4 transmembrane fragment but, as was
previously addressed, within the ion channel.
concerning neuronal achrs, qx-222 has been shown to
block the achr in rat parasympathetic ganglion cells, in the
clonal cell line pc12, in the alpha7 subtype, and in the alpha4beta2
neuronal receptor (see table 4). notably, the alpha4beta2 receptor
type showed a much lower sensitivity to qx-222 than other
achrs. the structural components that confer this affinity
distinction might be elucidated by considering which amino
acids on the m2 domain of the achr types are different. in
chick brain alpha7 receptors, the pharmacological effect of qx222 was abolished by mutation of the leucine ring, in particular leu 247 to polar residues such as thr or ser [145]. as
expected, mutations on amino acids related to the agonist
binding site on the alpha7 achr, did not significantly change
the pharmacological properties of qx-222 (reviewed in
[12,15]).
based on these results, it is conceivable that the quaternary ammonium group of qx-222 is positioned close to
ser248, which is part of the conserved serine ring (position 6).
taking into account that the secondary structure of the m2
transmembrane domain of the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit is alpha-helical, ser 248
would be positioned one turn away from ser252. in turn,
alpha1ser252 (position 10) is located one residue apart from the
leucine ring (position 9). thus, the aromatic moiety of the
qx-222 molecule is near the leucine ring, ∼5.7 å away from
the serine ring (reviewed in [12,15]).
the blocking rate of qx-314 is similar to that of its
triethylamine structural analog qx-222. however, qx-314
remains in the ion channel for longer time (an order of magnitude more) than qx-222 does. thus, qx-222 is termed a
fast channel blocker whereas qx-314 is called a slow channel blocker. nevertheless, testing the protection elicited by
qx-314 on the reaction of methanethiosulfonate derivatives
with several cys-substituted (one at a time) residues in the
m2 segment of the mouse  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit, pascual and karlin
[146] considered that both las practically share the same
locus. when the channel was open, qx-314 protects com-

fig. (3). transverse schematic view of the achr (only three subunits are shown for simplicity) showing the most probable localization for
several la binding sites (modified from [15]). the photolabeling site for meproadifen mustard (blue) is located at the extracellular or outer
ring of the desensitized achr. additional photoaffinity labeling studies indicate that the binding site for tetracaine (red) is located between
the serine and the valine ring (including the leucine ring) of the resting achr. mutagenesis experiments and accessibility studies indicate
that the locus for qx-222 and qx-314 as well as for procaine (green) is positioned at both the serine and the leucine ring in the open ion
channel conformation. additional mutagenesis studies in the open state suggest that the (-)cocaine binding site (red) is located at the valine
ring and perhaps at the serine ring. the orange cones indicate the possible location for low-affinity la binding sites at the lipid-protein interface.

pletely the cys mutants on the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit located at glu241,
thr244, and ser248, and moderately those located at leu251 and
val255, whereas both leu258 and glu262 to cys mutants were
not protected by the drug. this evidence suggests that qx314 binds to the open ion channel and that its locus is found
at residues located between glu241 and leu251 of the alpha1m2
domain. the portion of the channel containing the sequence
between gly 240 and thr 244 is close to the cytoplasmic side of
the ion channel and it is suggested to be involved in the activation gate [147]. in addition, no protection was observed
when the channel was in the resting [146] or in the desensitized [148] state. another possibility is that qx-314 binds to
the same site as qx-222 [see fig. (3)] at the portion between
alpha1ser248 and alpha1ser252, and thus, the passage of the
methanethiosulfonate reagent to the cys-substituted residues
located in a more constricted region of the ion channel,
namely the gate, is consequently inhibited.
2b. binding sites for tertiary local anesthetics
previous experiments demonstrate that specific labeling
of the nca [125i]tid of the achr is inhibited by tetracaine
and  xxxd1869xxx  in the presence of alpha-btx (reviewed in

[12,15]). this is in accord with the fact that tetracaine binds
preferentially the achr in the resting state (see table 4).
thus, tetracaine might be competing with [125i]tid labeling
by a mutually exclusive mechanism. since the tid binding
site has been found to be located at the valine and leucine
rings (reviewed in [19]), the tetracaine locus should be close
to these rings. in fact, photoaffinity labeling studies using
[3h]tetracaine under uv activation indicate that this la incorporates with similar efficiency to  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx ,  xxxg836xxx , gamma, and delta
subunits [113]. more specifically, [3h]tetracaine labeled two
sets of homologous hydrophobic residues: one comprised by
alpha1leu251, beta1leu257, gammaleu260, and deltaleu265 [leucine ring (position 9)] and another formed by alpha1val255 and deltaval269 [valine
ring (position 13)] as well as residues deltaala268 (position 12)
and alpha1ile247 (position 5) [81]. the residues from both
subunits are almost coincident with the tid-labeled amino
acids in the resting state as well as with the cpz-labeled
amino acids in the desensitized state (valine and leucine
rings). in this regard, a model for the tetracaine binding site
was suggested [81]: the benzene ring (∼6.5 å) is positioned
at the leucine ring (position 9) with its n-butyl chain (∼4 å
wide in extended configuration) interacting with hydropho-

bic residues from both position 12 and 13 (valine ring), and
the dimethylamino group (probably protonated) interacting
with hydrophilic residues located close to the serine ring
(position 6). the possibility of interaction between the butylamino group of tetracaine and hydrophobic residues from
position 12 and 13 is supported by the fact that procaine,
which lacks the butyl group on the n-aryl moiety, interacts
with the resting achr with 1,000-fold lower affinity than
tetracaine [113] (see table 4). in addition, the fact that tetracaine is 10 times more potent as an inhibitor of torpedo than
of mouse muscle achrs can be explained by natural substitutions found in each receptor [149]. in this regard, one of
the four natural substitutions (ser to phe at position 6 from
the  xxxg836xxx  subunit) decreases the polarity at position 6 (serine
ring) reducing the favorability of interaction with the
charged dimethylamino group of tetracaine. additional resitable 5.

dues labeled by [3h]tetracaine (deltaala268 and alpha1ile247) extend
the definition of the surface of the m2 helix that is oriented
toward the channel lumen in the resting (closed) state beyond those side chains labeled by [125i]tid (residues 9 and
13; reviewed in [19]).
the location of the procaine binding site has also been
studied by site-directed mutagenesis [83]. the inhibitory
effect of procaine on dimethylphenylpiperazinium-evoked
ion channel activity of the mouse muscle achr was increased when the double mutant alpha1ser252ala/beta1thr265ala
was used (see table 5). based on this evidence, a procaine
binding site location similar to that determined for qx-222
(see previous section) is assumed. interestingly, the same
mutations did not affect the inhibitory properties of barbiturates. these results indicate that in the open channel confor-

mation, the binding site for procaine is distinct to that for
barbiturates. in this regard, a general conclusion might be
stated: only certain gas bind to the same locus as some las.
however, it is neccesary to take into consideration that the
results from our laboratory (competitive binding of tetracaine and barbiturates, ketamine, or pcp; [110,114]) were
done with torpedo achrs in the resting state whereas the
experiments showing differential sensitivity between procaine and barbiturates to m2 mutated-containing receptors
were performed in oocyte-expressing mouse achrs in the
open conformational state [83].
regarding the localization of the cocaine binding site,
recent experimental evidence using several neuronal achr
subtypes, chimeras, and mutants, has suggested that beta4phe255
[valine ring (position 13)] of the alpha3beta4 receptor subtype (see
table 4) is structurally involved with the high-affinity (-)
cocaine locus [125]. there are two possible modes of interactions: (a) one possibility is that the protonated amine group
of cocaine interacts with the aromatic ring of phe by cation-pi
interactions. in this case, the voltage-dependence of (-) cocaine inhibition might arise from the electrostatic nature of
the cation- pi interaction. the other possibility (b) is that the
cocaine phenyl ring is interacting with the aromatic moiety
of phe. in this case, and considering that cocaine has a size
of about 12 x 6 å, the amine group might project deeper into
the ion channel to reach position 6 (serine ring). additional
evidence suggests that (-)cocaine may allosterically inhibit
the alpha4beta2 receptor subtype by binding to a nonconserved
stretch of 50 amino acids preceding the m1 domain [125].
