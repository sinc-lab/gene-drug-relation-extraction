abstract
prostaglandins such as  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) interact with ep-class prostanoid receptors
including ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx  subtypes. we have conducted a detailed pharmacological
characterization of the binding of [ 3h]-pge2 to recombinant human ep1 prostanoid receptors
expressed in human embryonic kidney (hek-293) cells using a broad panel of natural and
synthetic prostanoids. the receptor displayed high af nity (kd ¯

prostanoids, including prostaglandins such as  xxxd14xxx  ( xxxg1073xxx  ) and pge2,
have many functions in biological systems such as immunoregulation, platelet
aggregation and smooth muscle contraction or relaxation (coleman et al 1994).
the diœerent prostanoid classes and their corresponding receptors (dp, ep, fp, ip
and tp) are linked through g-proteins to various intracellular signalling pathways
(camp generation, phosphoinositide turnover, ca2+ mobilization, etc.) (coleman
& humphrey 1993; coleman et al 1994). recently, various prostanoid agonists
have found utility in treating clinical conditions as diverse as male erectile
dysfunction (williams et al 1998) and increased intraocular pressure, a risk factor
associated with glaucoma (bito et al 1993; hellberg et al 2002). ep, dp and fp
receptors have been found in the ciliary muscle of the eye (davis & sharif 1999;
sharif et al 1999) and the trabecular meshwork (anthony et al 1998), key structures
for the maintenance of intraocular pressure. diœerent prostanoids apparently
lower intraocular pressure by diœerent mechanisms. whereas  xxxd1902xxx  appears to
increase out¯ ow via the uveoscleral route by promoting remodelling of the
extracellular matrix in the ciliary muscle (gabelt & kaufman 1989; lindsey et al
539

540

najam a. sharif and terry l. davis

1996),  xxxd124xxx  may lower intraocular pressure by stimulating conventional out¯ ow through the trabecular
meshwork by a camp-dependent mechanism (dijkstra
et al 1999). within the e-series prostanoids, at least four
subclasses of ep receptor (ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx  ) are
known (coleman et al 1994). subsequent to the cloning
of these four receptor genes from cdna in the mouse
(kiriyama et al 1997), rat (boie et al 1997) and humans,
the mechanisms of signal transduction for each subclass
has been delineated. in the case of the  xxxg1872xxx ,
activation by pge2 leads to phosphoinositide turnover
and mobilization of intracellular calcium (coleman et al
1994), which ultimately causes the ® nal biological response such as contraction of smooth muscle (lawrence
et al 1992; ndukwu et al 1997). the  xxxg1872xxx  has
been detected in the human kidney, liver and heart where
it may play a protective role in ionic balance (guan et al
1998) and possibly recovery from ischaemic insult (baek
et al 1999). the cloning of the rat (boie et al 1997),
mouse (kiriyama et al 1997) and human (funk et al
1993) ep1 receptors has been accomplished. the rodent
and human ep1 receptors appear to be quite homologous (funk et al 1993; boie et al 1997; kiriyama et al
1997). while preliminary pharmacological studies have
been conducted on rat and mouse ep1 receptors (see
above), little pharmacological characterization has been
described for the human  xxxg1872xxx . therefore, the
aim of the present study was to de® ne the binding pro® le
and pharmacological characteristics of the cloned
human  xxxg1872xxx  expressed in hek-293 cell membranes using a large number of natural and synthetic
prostanoids.

recombinant human  xxxg1872xxx  membranes

competitive binding assays

cell membranes from hek-293 cells expressing the
recombinant human  xxxg1872xxx  were purchased from
receptor biology, inc. (beltsville, md). the membranes
(batch 1481; 1.4 pmol (mg protein)­ 1 ) were stored in
liquid nitrogen until use.

assays were conducted in 10 mm 2-[n-morpholino]
ethanesulfonic acid (mes) buœer (ph 6.0) containing
1 mm edta and 10 mm mncl2, ph 6.0 (binding buœer).
initial tissue linearity studies were carried out using
0.5± 160 l g of hek-293 cell membranes expressing the
cloned human  xxxg1872xxx  per 0.5-ml total volume in
96-well assay blocks (matrix technologies corp., hudson, nh), using 3 nm [3h]-pge 2. membranes were
thawed quickly, diluted to the desired concentration in
binding buœer and mixed to a homogeneous suspension
before dispensation. after addition of the radioligand,
the blocks were incubated at 23° c for 90 min on a
rotary shaker (60 rev min­ 1 ). the assay mixture was
then harvested on whatman gf}b glass ® bre ® lter mats

radioligand

[3h]-pge 2 (nen life science products, inc., boston,
ma) was used in competitive binding studies. the
radioligand (batch no. net-428, lot 3281-134) had a
speci® c activity of 200 ci mol ­ 1 and was supplied at
0.1 mci ml­ 1. this reagent was stored at ® 40° c until
dilution in binding buœer.

cloned human  xxxg1872xxx  pharmacology

data analysis

resulting disintegrations per min­ 1 (d min­ 1 ) values
from individual assays were analysed with spreadsheetbased non-linear, iterative curve-® tting computer programs using logistic functions (bowen & jerman 1995;
sharif et al 1998). in some cases, assay data were
also analysed by the kell}ebda software package
(mcpherson 1983). for derivation of ki values from the
compound concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition
of ligand binding (ic50 values), the method of cheng &
prusoœ(1973) was employed. the correlation plots were
constructed in the origin scienti® c graphics software
package (microcal software, northampton, ma).

(previously soaked in 0.5 % polyethyleneimine) using
rapid vacuum ® ltration with cold 10 mm mes plus
1 mm edta (ph 6). the mats were dried in a microwave
oven for 3 min before being sealed in a plastic bag with
30 ml wallac betaplate scint scintillation ¯ uid (wallac
oy, turku, finland). bound radioligand was then quanti® ed by liquid scintillation spectrometry at 50% e ciency.
for routine assays, the hek-293 cell membranes
containing the  xxxg1872xxx  were used at 8 l g per 0.5 ml
total volume. a series of competitive binding assays was
carried out with unlabelled pge2 to determine the
dissociation constant (kd ) and maximal ligand binding
(bmax ) values for the membrane preparation using the
speci® c activity dilution paradigm. in these assays,
unlabelled pge2 was diluted in ten half-log steps and
50 l l of each dilution was added to the assay block in
duplicate using a biomek 2000 automated laboratory
workstation (beckman instruments, inc., fullerton,
ca). this was followed by the addition of 400 l l of cell
membranes and 50 l l of the radioligand (® nal concentration 2 nm ). other assay parameters were as detailed above. for competitive binding determination of
equilibrium inhibition constant (ki ) values, prostanoid
compounds were diluted in ® ve log steps and assayed in
duplicate as described above. non-speci® c binding in
both assay formats was determined with 10 l m pge2, or
in some instances, by the highest concentration of the
test compound. both methods yielded very similar data.

still preserve adequate signal strength, it was decided
that 8 l g per 0.5 ml of the membrane preparation

while sulprostone mirrored the a nity of  xxxd124xxx  for
the  xxxg1872xxx  (tables 1 and 2). the 11-deoxy
derivative of  xxxd124xxx  was less active than native  xxxd124xxx 
by a factor approaching two logs, while the a nity
of misoprostol resembled the low a nities displayed by
pgd 2 and pgi2. when fp-receptor-speci® c prostaglandin analogues (e.g.  xxxd3414xxx  acid) were tested, all
displayed a nities at least two log units lower than
pge2 (table 3). however, the same could not be said
for two prostaglandin analogues reported as being
speci® c for the dp receptor. in fact, zk110841 and
zk118182 displayed a nities for the cloned human ep1
receptor that were equal to or greater than  xxxd124xxx  itself
(table 3, figure 2b). modi® cation of zk118182 to the
13,14-dihydro derivative (al-6556) abolished this high
a nity. all putative  xxxg1875xxx -receptor-speci® c ligands had
a nities approximately 3 logs lower than that of pge2
(figure 2c; table 2). when synthetic derivatives of
 xxxd124xxx  were evaluated, the 13,14-dihydro derivative retained much of the a nity of the native prostaglandin,
while the 11-deoxy derivative was weaker by almost two
logs (figure 2d). a quantitative summary of all of the
data from the competitive binding experiments for the
human ep1 receptors is presented in tables 1± 3.
a good correlation was found between the pharmacological pro® le of the cloned human and rat ep1
receptors (r ¯ 0.81, p! 0.001 ; figure 3), but a lesser
correlation (r ¯ 0.55) existed between the cloned human
and mouse ep1 receptors (data not shown).

hek-293 cells yielded a linear regression ® t with a

a correlation coe cient of 0.55 (data not shown).

discussion
at present, the existing literature dealing speci® cally
with the  xxxg1872xxx  is sparse. the cloning and initial
pharmacological characterization of the human and
rodent  xxxg1872xxx  has been reported (funk et al 1993;
boie et al 1997; kiriyama et al 1997). the  xxxg1872xxx 
is a heptahelical g-protein coupled protein which couples to phospholipase c to generate inositol phosphates
and diacylglycerol and mobilizes intracellular calcium
(funk et al 1993; coleman et al 1994; ichikawa et al
1996; boie et al 1997; kiriyama et al 1997). the rodent
and human ep1 receptors share a high degree of homology at the genetic and amino acid sequence levels but
there are only very limited studies describing their
respective pharmacological characteristics (see above).

receptor expressed in hek-293 cells using several classes
of natural and synthetic prostanoids. the initial binding
studies yielded a high degree of speci® c binding expected
of a uniquely expressed recombinant protein like other
cloned receptors (e.g.  xxxg1875xxx  receptors ; davis & sharif
2000). the dissociation constant (kd ¯ 16 nm ) for [3h]pge2 binding to the cloned human  xxxg1872xxx  protein
in our studies correlated reasonably well with that

reported by funk et al (1993) of 1 nm , and this was also
in good agreement with that of the recombinant rat
receptor (kd ¯ 24 nm ; boie et al 1997) and mouse receptor (kd ¯ 21 nm ; kiriyama et al 1997). the overall
receptor density (bmax ) value we obtained (3.69 pmol
(mg protein)­ 1 ) compared well with that for the rat
receptor (3.3 pmol (mg protein)­ 1 ; boie et al 1997), but
not for the mouse receptor (200 fmol (mg protein)­ 1 ;

kiriyama et al 1997) or the cloned human  xxxg1872xxx 
expressed in cos-m6 cells (funk et al 1993). these
similar and disparate expression levels may explain the
general agreement of our drug inhibition data with
those generated using the rat receptor but not with those
of kiriyama et al (1997) with the mouse receptor.
unfortunately, the previous pharmacological data for
the cloned human  xxxg1872xxx  (funk et al 1993) are
rather limited and direct comparisons are not possible
with our studies.
in terms of the pharmacological characteristics of the
 xxxg1872xxx , our data compared favourably with the
limited data of boie et al (1997) for the rat  xxxg1872xxx ,
and for some compounds tested, our values also agreed
well with those generated by kiriyama et al (1997) for
the mouse  xxxg1872xxx . for the natural prostaglandins,
this was most apparent with pge2, where we obtained a
ki value of 14.9 nm versus 22 nm reported by boie et al
(1997) and 20 nm by kiriyama et al (1997). however,
our ki values for  xxxd124xxx  were signi® cantly higher (165 nm )
than those of boie et al (1997) (95 nm ) or kiriyama et al
(1997) (36 nm ). there are also other instances in which
our results vary signi® cantly from those studies using
cloned rat or mouse ep1 receptors. for instance,  xxxd2331xxx 
yielded a k i value of 2.6 l m in our hands, whereas the
rat and mouse receptors yielded k ivalues of 11.5 nm and
21 nm , respectively (boie et al 1997; kiriyama et al
1997). other cases illustrate the general agreement seen
with results generated using the rat receptor as depicted
in figure 3. sulprostone yields a ki value of 137 nm in
our system, and 94 nm with the rat receptor. however,
kiriyama et al (1997) reported a ki value of only 21 nm .
the relatively high a nity of enprostil at the ep1
receptor is not surprising since it has ep3}ep1 pharmacology (coleman et al 1994). the relatively low
a nity of sc-19220 at the  xxxg1872xxx  is also consistent
with the reported low potency of this compound in
other systems (coleman et al 1994).
the most surprising ® nding was that the dp-receptorspeci® c compounds zk118182 and zk110841 had high
a nity for the recombinant human  xxxg1872xxx . other
compounds known to be partially speci® c for the ep1
receptor along with other receptor classes such as enprostil, sulprostone, and 17-phenyl-x -trinor-pge 2, produced expected binding pro® les. there is a recent report
of a biphenylene dibenzazocine class of compounds that
appears to be strongly selective for the  xxxg1872xxx 
subclass in comparison with all other prostanoid receptors (ruel et al 1999). unfortunately, we did not have
access to these latter compounds for our studies.
there are certainly many reports dealing with eœects
of prostanoid compounds in which elevated intracellular

545

calcium plays a pivotal role, but there is controversy
regarding the receptors mediating these processes. for
example, even though pge2 and 17-phenyl-x -trinorpge2 increase intracellular calcium levels in rat microglia (caggiano & kraig 1999) and in human ciliary
muscle cells (chen et al 1997), the involvement of the
 xxxg1872xxx  here is still unde® ned since neither of these
agents is speci® c for the  xxxg1872xxx . thus, these reports
imply either a direct eœect on the  xxxg1872xxx  in
increasing intracellular calcium or an indirect eœect
resulting from stimulation of another prostanoid receptor. other investigations have probed the ability of
 xxxg1872xxx  agonists to inhibit cation in¯ ow through
diœerent ionic channels, either the l-type ca2+ channel
or the ca2+-activated  xxxg1232xxx  (clapp et al
1998; yamamoto et al 1999). there are also reports of
ep1 receptors in the nuclear membrane of cultured cells,
implying a role in activation}regulation of transcription
(bhattacharya et al 1998). in the cat eye, agonists acting
at the  xxxg1872xxx  appear to lower intraocular pressure,
and selective ep1 agonists are being explored for their
ability to control increased intraocular pressure in humans (stjernschantz et al 1999). the multitude of functional responses generated in diœerent cell models by
prostanoid compounds presents a complicated picture
of inter-related receptors and second messenger molecules. as the natural prostaglandins and many prostaglandin analogues interact with multiple prostaglandin
receptor classes, assignment of downstream events to a
particular class can be problematic. therefore, the use
of pharmacological agents described herein may be
useful to help delineate whether ep1 receptors are involved in these various processes.
in summary, the recombinant human  xxxg1872xxx 
expressed in hek-293 cells provides us with an appropriate model to evaluate the binding of prostanoid
compounds to probe and de® ne the pharmacological
properties of this receptor. future evaluation of synthetic prostanoids may provide truly speci® c ligands
which would be invaluable tools in the characterization
of ep1-receptor-dependent functional responses in human cells and tissues.

conclusion

it is concluded that the cloned human  xxxg1872xxx 
transfected into hek-293 cells can be expressed at
relatively high levels. the expressed  xxxg1872xxx  protein
binds [3h]-pge 2 with a high a nity yielding very high
speci® c binding. the overall pharmacological characteristics of the cloned human  xxxg1872xxx  have been

546

najam a. sharif and terry l. davis

de® ned by use of numerous natural and synthetic prostanoids. collectively, these agents and data may be
useful in ascribing  xxxg1872xxx  function to the physiological and pharmacological actions of pge2 in biological systems in-vitro and in-vivo.
