subtype-selective fashion

in order to study the regulation of human cardiac and vascular b-adrenoceptors as
induced by b-adrenoceptor antagonism we determined b-adrenoceptor density and
subtype distribution in right atria, saphenous veins and lymphocytes from 60 patients
undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting; 42 of these patients were chronically
treated with different b-adrenoceptor antagonists [without intrinsic sympathomimetic
activity: propranolol, sotalol (non-selective); metoprolol, atenolol (8;-selective); with
intrinsic sympathomimetic activity:  xxxd2957xxx  (non-selective)] and 18 patients not treated
with b-adrenoceptor antagonists were taken as controls. in the right atria (70% b-,
30% be2-adrenoceptors) of all groups except the  xxxd2957xxx  group, total b-adrenoceptor
density was higher than in controls. a more detailed analysis revealed that all b-
adrenoceptor antagonists increased right atrial b,;-adrenoceptor density, but right atrial
b2-adrenoceptor density was increased only in the sotalol/propranolol group, remaining
unchanged in the metoprolol and atenolol groups, and was decreased in the  xxxd2957xxx 
group. similarly, in saphenous veins and circulating lymphocytes (in both, the b-
adrenoceptors were almost exclusively bo-adrenoceptors), only propranolol/sotalol
increased the be-adrenoceptor density, while metoprolol or atenolol did not affect it.
moreover, in the  xxxd2957xxx  group lymphocyte b2-adrenoceptor density was decreased.
it is concluded that in man all b-adrenoceptor antagonists without intrinsic sympa-
thomimetic activity increase cardiac and vascular b-adrenoceptor density, but in a
subtype-selective manner. accordingly,  xxxd2957xxx  can be subclassified as a partial bo-
adrenoceptor agonist.

introduction

growing evidence has accumulated that agonists and
antagonists regulate b,- and b,adrenoceptors in a
subtype-selective manner [1,2]. for example, in rats im-
planted with a noradrenaline-secreting phaeochromocy-
toma only cardiac and pulmonary b,-adrenoceptors were
downregulated, whereas b2-adrenoceptors were not af-

selective b-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol signif-
icantly increased 8.-adrenoceptor density in circulating
lymphocytes [7]. similarly, the highly selective b,-
adrenoceptor antagonist ici 118,551 increased the lym-
phocyte b2-adrenoceptor density in healthy volunteers
while bisoprolol, a highly selective §;-adrenoceptor an-
tagonist, did not affect it [8]. in order to find out whether
cardiac and vascular b-adrenoceptors undergo similar
subtype-selective regulation in humans we determined
the b-adrenoceptor density and subtype distribution in
right atrial and saphenous vein membranes obtained
from 60 patients chronically treated with different b-
adrenoceptor antagonists.

methods

human right atrial appendages were obtained from 60
patients [43 males, 17 females; mean age 59.2 + 2.7 (42-
75) years; new york heart association classes i-id]
undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting after
having given informed written consent. no patient suf-
fered from acute myocardial failure; none of the patients
had been treated with catecholamines for at least 3 weeks
before operation. the patients were divided into five
age-matched groups according to the chronic pretreat-
ment with b-adrenoceptor antagonists: the first group
(n = 18) had taken no b-adrenoceptor antagonist for at
least 6 weeks and served as the control group; the
second group (n = 13) was treated with the non-selec-
tive b-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol or sotalol,
the third group (n = 13) was on metoprolol treatment;
the fourth (n = 12) on atenolol treatment; and the fifth
(n = 4) on  xxxd2957xxx  treatment. in addition, some pa-
tients were being treated with nitrates (n = 48), calcium
antagonists (n = 42), diuretics (n = 10) and occasion-
ally digitalis glycosides (n = 3). premedication consisted
of flunitrazepam and atropine and the operation was
carried out under balanced anaesthesia with fentanyl,
isoflurane, and etomidate and flunitrazepam, respec-
tively. pancuronium was used as a muscle relaxant. in all
patients the atrial appendages and saphenous veins (pre-
pared from the distal third of the thigh) were removed
under normothermic conditions before cardiopul-
monary bypass. immediately after removal all speci-
mens were placed in sealed vials containing ice-cold
0.9% nacl solution and transported to the laboratory.
preparation of tissues was begun within 5-15 min after
surgical removal. preparation of right atrial membranes,
determination of the density of b-adrenoceptors by
(—)'l-iodocyanopindolol binding, and determination
of the relative amounts of b,- and -b2-adrenoceptors in
the right atria (from ici 118,551 competition curves with
the '°1-iodocyanopindolol binding) has been described
elsewhere [9]. human saphenous veins were cleaned of
connective tissue and transferred to ice-cold homoge-
nization buffer (0.25 mol/l sucrose, 50 mmol/| tris-hcl,
5mmol/l mgch, ph7.4), chopped with scissors and
homogenized with an ultra-turrax for 10s at full speed
four times at 1-min intervals. the homogenate was cen-
trifuged at 500g for 10min, and the supernatant was
cleaned through four layers of medical gauze and

centrifuged at 9000 g for 10 min. the pellets were dis-
carded and the supernatant was then centrifuged at
120 000 g for 45 min. the final pellets were resuspended
in the incubation buffer (10 mmol/l naghpo,, 10 mmol/l
nah,po, buffer ph 7.6) to yield a final protein concen-
tration of 0.3 mg/ml. the density of b-adrenoceptors in
human saphenous vein membranes was determined by
(—)'l-iodopindolol binding, at six to eight concentra-
tions of °i-iodopindolol, ranging from 10 to 300 pmol/l
for 40 min at 25°c. non-specific binding was defined as
binding that was not displaced by a high concentration
(1 pmol/l) of the hydrophilic b-adrenoceptor antag-
onist (4)-cgp 12177. specific binding was defined as
total binding minus non-specific binding and usually
amounted to 60% at 100pmol/ '°i-iodopindolol.
lymphocytes were prepared from 30 ml venous edta
blood by the béyum method [10]; the lymphocyte b.-
adrenoceptor density was determined in intact cells
by 'liodocyanopindolol binding exactly as recently
described [11].

statistical evaluations

the experimental data given here are means + s.e. of
n experiments. the equilibrium dissociation constants
(kp) and the maximal number of binding sites (bmax) for
51 iodocyanopindolol and '°i-iodopindolol were calcu-
lated either from scatchard plots [12] or by the computer
program ligand [13]. both methods yielded identical
results. competition curves were analysed by the iterative
curve-fitting program ligand [13]. statistical analysis was
performed using the f-ratio test to measure goodness of
fit of the competition curves for either one or two sites.
the significance of differences in the number of binding
sites in two different groups was estimated by student’s
t-test. p< 0.05 was considered significant. all drugs used
in this study were from sources recently described [9].

results

the mean number of b-adrenoceptors in right atrial
membranes (70% by-, 30% pb -adrenoceptors) in the
control group (ie. patients not treated with b-adreno-
ceptor antagonists) was calculated as 70.0 + 8.0 fmol
51 iodocyanopindolol specifically bound/mg protein
(n = 10). with the exception of the  xxxd2957xxx  group, the
atrial b-adrenoceptor density was significantly higher in
all groups of patients treated with the different b-adreno-
ceptor antagonists compared with controls (table 1). a
more detailed analysis of this increase revealed that all
b-adrenoceptor antagonists significantly increased the
atrial b,-adrenoceptor density; in contrast, only the
non-selective b-adrenoceptor antagonists sotalol and
propranolol concomitantly increased the atrial b.-
adrenoceptor density, while metoprolol or atenolol did
not affect it (table 1).  xxxd2957xxx  showed a differential
pattern of regulation: it increased the atrial b,- but
decreased the atrial b2-adrenoceptor density (table 1). in
the corresponding lymphocytes, 82-adrenoceptor density
was increased by propranolol and sotalol, not affected
by metoprolol and atenolol, and decreased by  xxxd2957xxx 
(table 1).

51 iodopindolol binding to human saphenous vein
membranes was saturable and of high affinity (kp values
between 40 and 70 pmol/l). beta-adrenergic agonists in-
hibited 1”°i-iodopindolol binding in the following order
of potency:  xxxd2398xxx  > adrenaline > noradrenaline,
which is typical for b.-adrenoceptors [14]. similarly, the
highly selective b2-adrenoceptor antagonist ici 118,551
was about 1000 times more potent than the highly selec-
tive b,-adrenoceptor antagonist cgp 20712 a in inhibit-
ing 't-iodopindolol binding. competition curves for ici
118,551 and cgp 20712 a were best fitted to a single
class of binding sites. thus, these data obtained by radio-
ligand binding studies confirm our previous observa-
tions that human saphenous veins contain predominantly
b2-adrenoceptors [15]. the mean number of human
saphenous vein ®2-adrenoceptors in the eight patients
not treated with b-adrenoceptor antagonists was cal-
culated as 22.3 + 2.5 fmol '”i-iodopindolol specifically
bound/mg protein (table 1). it was significantly increased
in the group of patients treated with propranolol or
sotalol, but not significantly different from controls in
those patients treated with metoprolol (table 1).

discussion

glaubiger and lefkowitz [16] were the first to demon-
strate that chronic administration of propranolol to rats
induced a significant increase in cardiac b-adrenoceptor
density. subsequently, several groups have shown that
chronic administration of propranolol in healthy vol-
unteers significantly increased b2-adrenoceptor density
in circulating lymphocytes [7]. similar effects were ob-
tained with the selective b,-adrenoceptor antagonist ici
118,551, which also increased lymphocyte b-adreno-
ceptor density [8]; however, selective b,-adrenoceptor
antagonists like bisoprolol or atenolol did not affect
lymphocyte b2-adrenoceptor density [7]. these results
_led to the concept that all b-adrenoceptor antagonists
without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity increase b-
adrenoceptor density but in a subtype-selective manner.

the results of the present study confirm this hypothesis.
they show that in human right atrium (containing b,- and
b2-adrenoceptors) as well as in human saphenous veins
(containing predominantly b.-adrenoceptors), b-adreno-
ceptor antagonists without intrinsic sympathomimetic
activity subtype-selectively upregulate b-adrenoceptor
density. the non-selective b-adrenoceptor antagonists
sotalol and propranolol chaving an almost equal affin-
ity to b,- and b2-adrenoceptors) increased both b,- and
62-adrenoceptors in the heart and b2-adrenoceptors in
saphenous veins and lymphocytes to a similar extent.
in contrast, the selective b;-adrenoceptor antagonists
metoprolol and atenolol increased only the right atrial
b.-adrenoceptor density, but did not affect lymphocyte
or saphenous vein b2-adrenoceptors.

it has been shown repeatedly that, in contrast to b-
adrenoceptor antagonists without intrinsic sympath-
omimetic activity,  xxxd2957xxx , a non-selective b-adrenocep-
tor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity,
leads to a selective decrease of b.-adrenoceptors in
circulating lymphocytes [7] (table 1), rat heart [17] and
c.-glioma cells [18]. this effect seems to be due to the
partial agonistic activity of  xxxd2957xxx , since it could be
completely prevented by simultaneous administration of
propranolol [19]. the present results show that  xxxd2957xxx 
exerts a similar bj-adrenoceptor decreasing effect in the
human heart: in the  xxxd2957xxx  group the b-adrenoceptor
density in the right atrium was about 50% lower than
that in the control. however, like the other b-adreno-
ceptor antagonists,  xxxd2957xxx  significantly increased b,-
adrenoceptor density in the atria. thus, according to
these results, in humans  xxxd2957xxx  may be classified as
a mixed ®,-adrenoceptor antagonist and a (partial) bo-
adrenoceptor agonist.
