histamine h2-receptor antagonism by propantheline and derivatives.  the histamine h2-antagonist properties of propantheline and its tertiary amine derivatives were investigated. propantheline and  xxxd2590xxx  inhibited the histamine-activated cyclase of guinea-pig brain homogenates, a well characterized h2-receptor preparation; the inhibition was not competitive. tertiary amine derivatives were competitive h2-antagonist in this system, one such derivative exhibiting greater potency than cimetidine. in concentrations blocking the brain h2-receptors, these derivatives had no effect on atrial histamine dose-response curves, but evidence for their antagonism on peripheral h2-receptors was obtained with papillary muscle preparations. the results suggest that the guinea-pig brain h2-linked cyclase of homogenates is a sensitive predictor of peripheral h2-antagonist activity. these drugs may also be effective inhibitors of gastric secretion.
