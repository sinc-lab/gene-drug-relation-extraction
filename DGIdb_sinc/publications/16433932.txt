abstract
background: the aim of the present study was to describe the activity of a set of opioid drugs,
including partial agonists, in a human embryonic kidney cell system stably expressing only the
mouse kappa-opioid receptors. receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of cyclic
adenosine mono phosphate (camp) production stimulated by 5 µm  xxxd1742xxx . intrinsic activities and
potencies of these ligands were determined relative to the endogenous ligand dynorphin and the kappa
agonist with the highest intrinsic activity that was identified in this study, fentanyl.
results: among the ligands studied naltrexone, win 44,441 and  xxxd1864xxx , were classified as
antagonists, while the remaining ligands were agonists. intrinsic activity of agonists was assessed by
determining the extent of inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production. the absolute levels
of inhibition of camp production by each ligand was used to describe the rank order of intrinsic
activity of the agonists; fentanyl = lofentanil ≥ hydromorphone = morphine = nalorphine ≥
 xxxd2070xxx  ≥ xorphanol ≥ metazocine ≥ skf 10047 = cyclazocine ≥ butorphanol > nalbuphine. the
rank order of affinity of these ligands was; cyclazocine > naltrexone ≥ skf 10047 ≥ xorphanol ≥
win 44,441 > nalorphine > butorphanol > nalbuphine ≥ lofentanil >  xxxd1864xxx  ≥ metazocine ≥
morphine > hydromorphone > fentanyl.
conclusion: these results elucidate the relative activities of a set of opioid ligands at kappa-opioid
receptor and can serve as the initial step in a systematic study leading to understanding of the mode
of action of these opioid ligands at this receptor.

background
opioid ligands possess a variety of physiological activities
and medical uses, with the most prominent being in the
treatment of pain. pharmacological studies indicate that
selective µ-opioid agonists are effective antinociceptive
agents in virtually every test of analgesia [1,2]. however,
at their analgesic doses, µ-opioid receptor agonists can
induce ventilatory depression [3] and the development of

physical dependence [4]. delta opioid receptors have
been reported to modulate analgesia, autonomic nervous
system function, neuroendocrine system function, and
mood driven behaviors [5]. activity of kappa-opioid receptors
modulate spinal antinociception [6]. mu and kappa – but not
delta-opioid receptors modulate ventilatory depression [7].
thus each class of opioid receptors represents an important drug target to investigate.

a major medical application of opioid ligands has been as
potent analgesics. however, untoward effects associated
with opioids limit their wider use for analgesia. numerous opioid ligands have been synthesized with the promise of effective analgesia and minimal side-effects;
however this goal has yet to be realized. the studies leading to the synthesis of novel opioid ligands have relied on
research in animals or tissues expressing multiple opioid
receptors. thus, characterization of the activity profiles for
these opioid ligands at individual opioid receptors has
only been possible after the cloning of opioid receptors.
such information is essential to the design of a new generation of opioid analgesics that would exhibit diminished side-effects.
we have previously characterized fifteen opioid ligands in
cells expressing only delta-opioid receptor [8] or µ-opioid
receptor [9]. the present study was devised to characterize
the activity of these same opioid ligands in a cell line
expressing only kappa-opioid receptors. the ligands were chosen based on our previous model tissue data suggesting
that they bind to all three opioid receptor types [10] and
some display differential activation profiles in vivo at each
of the opioid receptor types [11]. thus, the present study
was designed to achieve the following goals; (1) to
describe the activation profiles of a set of opioid ligands

not previously defined in an isolated cell system expressing only kappa-opioid receptor using inhibition of forskolinstimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in intact cells, and (2)
to compare the intrinsic activities of these drugs to the
known kappa-opioid receptor agonist with very high intrinsic
activity, fentanyl, and the endogenous kappa-opioid ligand,
dynorphin. the results obtained from this study can serve
to clarify the categorization of each of the ligands studied
as an agonist, weak/partial agonist or antagonist at kappa-opioid receptors. moreover, these results demonstrate the
interaction of each drug with a single receptor type at the
molecular level. finally, these results, together with our
previously published data on these ligands at µ and delta opioid receptors, help define the activity of these ligands at all
three opioid receptor types.

results
the binding affinity and activation potency of fifteen opioid ligands were assessed in hek cells stably expressing kappaopioid receptors.
binding assays
to further investigate the activity or affinity of selected ligands at kappa-opioid receptors, competition binding assays
against a radiolabeled ligand were performed using cell
homogenates from transfected cells. human embryonic

data represent the mean ± sem obtained from the best fit curve for data from two or more experiments carried out in duplicate. all compounds
denoted as antagonists completely reversed the effect of 1 nm  xxxd2070xxx . the effect of 1 nm  xxxd2070xxx  in inhibiting camp production was 50–60%
of maximum  xxxd2070xxx  effect. lofentanil and fentanyl had the highest intrinsic activity among the ligands tested. relative intrinsic activity of the
ligands were also compared to that of the putative endogenous ligand for kappa-opioid receptor, dynorphin (ec50 = 8 ± 2 nm, intrinsic activity = 52 ±
3%). all three ligands, lofentanil, fentanyl and dynorphin had similar intrinsic activity. the intrinsic activity of each ligand relative to fentanyl
(designated as 1) and the endogenous ligand dynorphin was determined. statistical significance was calculated for the inhibitory effect of each ligand
in comparison to fentanyl and dynorphin. (*). statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) relative to fentanyl or dynorphin suggested that the test
ligand was a partial agonist compared to both reference ligands. the binding affinity of each ligand was measured by competition assays. the ki for

kidney (hek) cells were transfected with mouse cdna for
kappa-opioid receptor. these cells do not normally express
endogenous kappa-opioid receptors, as demonstrated by a lack
of binding to the radioactive [3h]-u69,593 (data not
shown). individual hek clones expressing single opioid
receptor types were propagated and used for the experiments presented here. expression level of the selected
clone was 492 ± 39 fmole/mg protein. similar levels of
expression have been reported for these receptors in neurons [12] and for other transfected cells expressing this
receptor [13]. competition binding studies were carried
out for each ligand in the presence of [3h]-u69,593. all
ligands studied exhibited ki values in the nanomolar
range. the rank order of affinity of these ligands was;

cyclazocine > naltrexone ≥ skf 10047 ≥ xorphanol ≥ win
44,441 > nalorphine > butorphanol > nalbuphine ≥ lofentanil >  xxxd1864xxx  ≥ metazocine ≥ morphine > hydromorphone > fentanyl.
activation assays
overall, a range of intrinsic activities and potencies were
observed for the different ligands at kappa-opioid receptor
(table 1). butorphanol, cyclazocine,  xxxd2070xxx , fentanyl,
hydromorphone, lofentanil, metazocine, morphine, nalorphine, skf 10047 and xorphanol were full agonists.
these ligands inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production to the levels that were not significantly different
from the inhibitory levels of the endogenous ligand

behaved as an antagonist (fig. 1). these ligands exhibited
little or no measurable inhibitory effect on  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production when used alone and were able
to block the inhibitory effect of 1 nm  xxxd2070xxx  (ic50 = 2
nm, 8.5 µm and 300 nm respectively). finally, nalbuphine exhibited partial agonist activity at these receptors.
statistical analysis of the differences between the intrinsic
activities of different ligands was carried out to distinguish
the full agonists from the partial agonists. based on these
analyses, there was no difference in the intrinsic activity of
any of the agonists compared to both dynorphin and fentanyl (the ligand with the highest intrinsic activity, fig.
1a), except for nalbuphine, which had significantly lower
intrinsic activity (p < 0.05). thus, nalbuphine is a true partial agonist at kappa-opioid receptors (fig. 1c). nevertheless,
if these ligands were to be ranked based on their absolute
level of activity, irrespective of statistical significance, their
rank order of intrinsic activity would be fentanyl = lofentanil ≥ hydromorphone = morphine = nalorphine ≥  xxxd2070xxx  ≥ xorphanol ≥ metazocine ≥ skf 10047 =
cyclazocine ≥ butorphanol > nalbuphine. finally, as seen
in figure 2, 100 nm win 44,441 could antagonize the
effect of  xxxd2070xxx , and 1 µm of win 44, 441 completely
antagonized the effect of 1 nm  xxxd2070xxx .

discussion
a complex interaction between various opioid receptors
exists as they modulate various physiological functions.
understanding these complex interactions requires a thor-

ough understanding of the activation pattern of individual opioid receptors. available data on the activation
profiles of the test ligands relative to each specific opioid
receptor were found to be either sparse or involved various systems and cell lines, thus making meaningful comparisons between affinities, intrinsic activities and
potencies across various studies unreliable. the present
study utilized a cell system that allowed for the expression
of kappa-opioid receptor subtype. previously, these ligands
were characterized in the same expression system expressing µ or delta-opioid receptors [8,9]. thus, this data combined
with the data reported in the last two reports can be used
to compare the relative selectivity of these same ligands at
the three different opioid receptors expressed in the same
cell system.
a well-defined receptor expression system was used to
characterize the activity of a set of opioid ligands and to
compare the intrinsic activities and potencies of these ligands at kappa-opioid receptors. the main advantage of using
transfected hek cells for this study is that these cells do
not contain endogenous kappa-opioid receptors, but express
the g proteins necessary for the proper coupling of the
transfected cdnas to the respective second messenger systems. a well established method for assessing g-protein
activation by opioid receptors and characterizing activity
of opioid ligands is measuring the extent of inhibition of
 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity [14-19].
adenylyl cyclase has been implicated in playing a role in
mediating the analgesic effect of opioid ligands through
µ-opioid receptors [20-22]. thus, characterizing the ability of opioid ligands to inhibit camp production, such as
described in this report, could be used as an index for
assessing their activity as a correlate of their analgesic
effects. moreover, a simple well-defined system, such as
the one used in this study, can be very beneficial in
describing the mode of action of each ligand at a specific
receptor. although hek cells are not neuronal in nature,
and might be devoid of some of the intracellular machinery present in the body, nevertheless they serve as a useful
tool for such studies on a single receptor. furthermore, it
is understood that once applied to the whole animal in
vivo, the overall effect of the drug will be a composite of
the effects of the drug on all receptor types interacting
with it. in addition, the pharmacokinetic parameters, such
as metabolism, tissue absorption and distribution of the
drug will play a major role in the overall drug effect in vivo.
the present set of ligands exhibited a range of intrinsic
activities and potencies. the drug with the highest intrinsic activity was fentanyl, supporting previous in vivo studies describing fentanyl as a highly potent and efficacious
analgesic drug [11]. in the present study, the intrinsic
activity of lofentanil was equal to that of fentanyl. nalbuphine was the only ligand that showed significantly lower
intrinsic activity compared to fentanyl and dynorphin.

bmc pharmacology 2006, 6:3

the low intrinsic activity of this ligand combined with its
high binding affinity to kappa-opioid receptors (6 nm) suggest
that nalbuphine can potentially act as competitive antagonists at the kappa-opioid receptors in vivo. while the ec50 of
this compound in inhibiting camp production is in
micromolar range, based on the nanomolar binding affinity, the concentration of this compound required to block
the activity of agonists (ic50) in vivo could be much lower.

conclusion
in summary, this report describes a detailed comparative
study of the binding affinities and inhibitory effects of a
set of opioid ligands on the accumulation of camp in
intact cells expressing kappa-opioid receptors. the intrinsic
activities of these ligands have been compared to that of
the endogenous opioid ligand, dynorphin, and the ligand
identified in this study as having the highest intrinsic
activity, fentanyl. moreover, this report serves to clarify
the activity of many previously un-characterized ligands
in cells expressing only kappa-opioid receptors, thus leading to
a better understanding of the mechanism of action of
these drugs.

methods
cell culture
human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells were maintained in d-mem/f-12 (dulbecco's modified eagle's
medium: nutrient mixture f-12 1:1 mixture), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (fcs), 200 µg/ml
 xxxd2191xxx  ( xxxd2191xxx ®) in a humidified incubator with 5%
co2 and 95% air, at 37°c. the incubation medium was
changed every 3–4 days. once a week, cells were re-plated
at 20% density into 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks.
establishing stable cells expressing kappa-opioid receptors
hek 293 cells were transfected with the cdna for mouse
kappa-opioid receptor using the lipofectin® reagent (life technologies, rockville, md). mouse kappa-opioid receptor cdna
was in the vector pcmv (a generous gift from dr. g. bell)
and was co-transfected with the vector prsvneo in order
to establish a stable clone. stable clones were selected
using 400 µg/ml  xxxd2191xxx ®. a single clone expressing 492
± 39 fmole/mg protein for kappa-opioid receptors as assessed
by [3h]-u69-593 binding was selected for these studies.
binding assays
saturation and competition binding assays were carried
out in hek-kappa cells using [3h]-u69-593. experiments were
carried out as described previously [9,23]. each assay was
carried out in triplicates in a 250 µl total reaction volume
containing 20–25 µg of crude cell homogenate per assay
tube. incubation was in 50 mm tris hcl buffer, ph 7.4 at
room temperature for 2 hours. the assay was terminated
by rapid filtration through whatman gf/b filters followed
by three washes, with ice-cold buffer. radioactivity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/6/3

retained on the filters was measured using liquid scintillation counting.
competition binding assays were carried out in crude
homogenate of hek-kappa cells. binding was carried out in
250 µl volume of 50 mm tris hcl buffer, ph 7.4 in the
presence of about 0.5–1 nm [3h]-u69-593 and increasing
concentrations (24–32) of unlabeled ligand. incubation
and washing were as described above. binding data were
analyzed using prism™ software. the values determined
using these two analysis methods were in agreement. for
preparation of crude cell homogenate, confluent cultures
of hek-kappa cells were harvested using phosphate buffered
saline. following centrifugation, the cell pellet was re-suspended in ice-cold 50 mm tris hcl buffer ph 7.4 at about
107cell/ml, and homogenized using a polytron at setting
6 for 10 seconds. the cell homogenate was stored in aliquots at -86°c until use. protein content of the cell
homogenate was determined using bio-rad protein assay
reagent (bio-rad, hercules, ca).
whole cell adenylyl cyclase assays
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  (camp)
production after exposure to each ligand was evaluated in
intact transfected hek cells as reported previously [9].
exponentially growing transfected hek cells were harvested and re-suspended in serum free dmem/f12
medium. cells were plated in 96 well microtiter plates at
5 × 104 cells/well in 100 µl volume. to each well, phosphodiesterase inhibitor  xxxd2388xxx 
( xxxd2388xxx ) was added to a final concentration of 100 µm, followed by addition of agonists at different concentrations
and incubation at 37°c. following incubation for 15
minutes,  xxxd1742xxx  was added to each well to a final concentration of 5 µm followed by another incubation for 15
minutes at 37°c. the ec50 of  xxxd1742xxx  in these cells was
10 µm [24]. the reaction was terminated by aspiration of
the medium and addition of lysis buffer from the biotrak™
camp enzyme immunoassay kit from amersham pharmacia biotech (buckinghamshire, england). the rest of
the assay followed the protocol provided with the kit.
actual amount of camp was determined for each sample
in comparison to a standard curve of known amounts of
camp provided in the camp kit, as described in the kit
protocol.
agonism
agonistic activity of opioid ligands was assessed by measuring the inhibitory effect of the drugs on  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accumulation. data were normalized to the
top of the curve (no drug, 100%), expressed as percent
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accumulation
and were fitted to a sigmoidal function by using one site
competition function as described below. the intrinsic
activity of each ligand was defined as percent inhibition of

 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production compared to no
drug levels (0% inhibition, 100% camp production).
antagonism
compounds with no or very small in vitro agonistic activity (<20% inhibition of camp production) for which the
dose response curves could not be fitted due to the small
effect, were tested for antagonism. antagonists were
defined as ligands that were able to block the inhibitory
effect of 1 nm  xxxd2070xxx  on  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp
production. in these assays, antagonists were added to the
cells along with  xxxd2388xxx . after 15 minutes of incubation, the
agonist was added and the cells were incubated with both
drugs for an additional 10 minutes. the rest of the assay
was as described above.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/6/3

were dissolved in distilled water except cyclazocine,  xxxd1864xxx , and  xxxd2070xxx , which were dissolved in 100% ethanol. for the drugs dissolved in ethanol, the final
concentration of ethanol in the reaction was <0.01%
which had no affect on the assays performed.
statistical analysis
maximal inhibitory effect of each ligand was compared to
the levels of maximal inhibition by dynorphin and fentanyl using anova analysis with dunnett's multiple comparison as post-test using prism™ software (graphpad
software, inc. san diego, ca). significant difference
between the inhibitory effects of two ligands was determined whenever p < 0.05.

authors' contributions
curve fitting
the analysis of drug activity was performed using prism™
software (graphpad software, inc. san diego, ca). a
computer-generated "best fit" of non-linear regression
data was used to provide an estimate of the effective concentration at 50% (ec50). dose response data generated
by camp enzyme immunoassay (eia) system were fitted
to the one site competition function.

author 1 (p.g.) carried out the camp assays, performed
data and statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
author 2 (n.h.) performed some of the receptor binding
assays. authors 3 and 4 (t.m.d & j.d.c.) provided intellectual input and critical interpretation of the data. author
4 (j.l.) conceived of the study, participated in its design
and coordination, carried out most of the binding assays
and finalized the manuscript for publication.

data processing
data from each dose response curve were normalized to
the top of the respective curve. the normalized data from
multiple independent dose response curves were combined and a new dose response curve was fitted to the
combined data and the ec50 and maximal inhibition were
determined for the combined data. in all cases standard
error of the mean (sem) of multiple measurements was
calculated using the formula; sem = sd/√n, where sd =
standard deviation and n = number of observations.
