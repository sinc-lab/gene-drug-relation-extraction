abstract
 xxxd77xxx  is a stable naphthoic acid derivative that displays a strong retinoid
agonist pharmacology. this drug controls cell proliferation and differentiation,
and possesses significant anti-inflammatory action. the retinoid action of  xxxd77xxx  are mediated by the ligand-activated gene transcription factors  xxxd3417xxx 
receptors rarbeta and rargamma. we describe here how an aqueous gel containing
 xxxd77xxx  was selected for the topical treatment of acne.

that class potency of a given substance may change according to the nature of formulation [2]. in the case of retinoids,
this area of research has received little attention due to the
lack of established pharmacodynamic parameters [3].
our objective was to develop a formulation optimized
for the topical treatment of acne. this was approached

in acne, the normal program of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation is disturbed in the pilosebaceous unit
and/or the epidermis. if this is accompanied by bacterial
colonization, chronic inflammation may result. as the origin of this disease is still unknown, we tested molecules for
their ability to modify the above parameters in order to
select the best candidates for potency and monitored local
tolerance in parallel. some key structural modifications of
retinoids are depicted in figure 1 ranging from the flexible,
photolabile conjugated double bond array of all-transretinoic acid, tretinoin (i), isotretinoin (ii), to the aromatic
derivative arotinoid (iii) and the naphthalene derivative
 xxxd77xxx  (iv).
the modifications in the chemical structure of the natural product tretinoin (i) were initially brought about to increase the biological half-life of the chemically and biochemically labile natural substance.  xxxd77xxx ,  xxxd77xxx 
(iv), was selected from our program [1] as the best choice
as a locally active potent drug with high stability and low
local side effect profile as compared to tretinoin.
a major prerequisite for an effective topical drug delivery form is that a sufficient concentration be delivered to
the site of action. the vehicle effect in skin pharmacology
is well known in the area of corticosteroids to the extent

through the knowledge that after topical application of a
formulation to the skin, percutaneous drug absorption can
follow two routes: the transepidermal and the transfollicular pathways. by in vitro and in vivo studies [4] we demonstrated that the penetration pathway of particles was dependent on their average diameter, with microparticles ranging
from 3 to 10 µm preferentially penetrating into the follicular ducts. consequently, a homogeneous suspension containing microcrystals of  xxxd77xxx  was prepared to optimize delivery to the target organ.

material and methods

skin distribution profile of  xxxd77xxx 
the radioactive formulation containing 0.1%  xxxd77xxx  was
prepared using the ingredients of the commercial  xxxd77xxx  gel and
14
c-radiolabeled  xxxd77xxx  [10]. the liberation-penetration profile of
 xxxd77xxx  was assessed using a static diffusion cell technique. the
study was performed on human keratomized mammary and abdominal surgery skin.
at the end of the application period, the nonpenetrated excess,
epidermal, dermal and receptor fluid levels were quantified by liquid
scintillation counting.
penetration pathway of  xxxd77xxx 
the penetration pathway of  xxxd77xxx  [10] was assessed in a qualitative in vitro study, using a static diffusion cell. human skin was obtained from plastic surgery.  xxxd77xxx  0.1% gel (50 mg/cm2 or 50 µg
of  xxxd77xxx cm2) was applied to the skin surface and massaged for
3 min. at 5 min and 2 h after application, the excess formulation was
removed and the skin samples were frozen at –80 °c. skin specimens
were embedded in tissue tek at –20 °c and longitudinal sections were
prepared with a microtome. the frozen sections were then analyzed
by fluorescence microscopy.

results and discussion
 xxxd77xxx  modulates cellular differentiation and
proliferation
treatment of the murine embryonal carcinoma cell line
f9 with tretinoin results in the induction of an epithelial
morphology accompanied by the secretion of specific
markers (table 1), e.g. plasminogen activator, indicating
that f9 stem cells are converted to endoderm-like cells.
 xxxd77xxx  is at least 3 times more active than tretinoin.

in cultured keratinocytes, tretinoin is known to suppress
the expression of the plasma-membrane-associated enzyme
transglutaminase type i. this enzyme catalyzes the formation of a cornified envelope beneath the plasma membrane
during the final stages of differentiation. the effect of an increasing concentration of  xxxd3417xxx  or  xxxd77xxx  on the
expression of transglutaminase type i can be quantified by
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. in this test,
 xxxd77xxx  is 10-fold more potent than  xxxd3417xxx .
hela cells, derived from a cervix carcinoma, are highly
proliferative. they can be used to assay the antiproliferative
activity of retinoids, which can be conveniently quantified
by assessing mitochondrial activity using the tetrazol assay.
tretinoin, isotretinoin and  xxxd77xxx  all inhibit cell proliferation with equal potency in this test system.
 xxxd77xxx  has higher affinity for rarbeta and rargamma than
for raralpha. this is shown by both direct binding measurements using recombinant proteins, and transactivation potentials estimated in cos-7 cells cotransfected with dna
encoding rar subtypes and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) reporter genes. concentrations resulting in
half-maximum activation of cat expression (ac50 values)
are given in table 2. furthermore, transactivation by rxralpha
is unaffected by  xxxd77xxx  indicating that this retinoid is
most likely a rar-selective ligand. these data may be explained first by the fact that  xxxd77xxx  is more stable than
tretinoin, and, secondly,  xxxd77xxx  has a different binding
profile to cellular and nuclear retinoic-acid-binding proteins.

 xxxd77xxx  0.1% gel  xxxd77xxx ® and vehicle were manufactured by
galderma laboratories. solution in acetone were freshly prepared
prior to each experiment. a tretinoin-containing gel (0.025%) was
purchased from commercial sources.
the in vitro assays were used as described: f9 cell differentiation
[5]; expression of transglutaminase by normal human keratinocytes [6];
hela cell proliferation [7];  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar) binding assay
[8]; the rhino mouse model [9] and the rabbit skin irritancy test [10].

 xxxd77xxx  has comedolytic activity
utricles (epidermal comedones) packed with cornified
debris are normally expressed in the epidermis of the rhino
mouse, which accounts for its wrinkled appearance. topical
application of  xxxd77xxx  produced a dose-related reduction of the number of epidermal comedones [9]. this activity was similar or superior to that observed with tretinoin.
in contrast, the intercomedone epidermal hyperplasia response was lower for  xxxd77xxx  when compared with
tretinoin. the choice of the concentration of 0.1% was
based upon the results obtained in the rhino mouse, an
established in vivo model for quantifying the comedolytic
potential of cutaneous formulations (fig. 3).
table 3 shows that  xxxd77xxx  0.1% gel was nonirritating
resulting in no erythema, edema and no desquamation. in
the same test, a reference gel containing 0.025% tretinoin
induced erythema, as well as edema and desquamation.
this irritation is probably due to the tretinoin and the alco-

holic gel vehicle. this choice was subsequently confirmed
in clinical trials of safety and efficacy. to examine the distribution of  xxxd77xxx  within the skin, radiolabeled  xxxd77xxx  was topically applied and the quantities recovered in
the different samples (mean and sem expressed in micrograms equivalent per square centimeter) were expressed as
a percentage of the applied dose (table 4).
after a 15-hour period, 64% of the applied dose of 14c
 xxxd77xxx  was recovered, 90% of which was present as surface excess.
extremely small amounts of radioactivity were detected
in the receptor fluid implying that the degree of systemic
exposure resulting from topical application of  xxxd77xxx 
0.1% gel would be minimal. the highest proportion of the
total amount recovered in the whole skin (4.3% of the applied dose) was found in epidermis and stratum corneum
which could result in comedolytic activity on closed comedones. the small amount of  xxxd77xxx  found in the dermis
could act on inflammatory lesions due to the high intrinsic
potency of the molecule. this distribution/penetration pro-

 xxxd77xxx  has anti-inflammatory activity
polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration and  xxxd208xxx  metabolism are two factors associated with the
etiology of a wide variety of cutaneous inflammatory reactions.  xxxd77xxx  significantly inhibited peripheral human
blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotactic and
chemokinetic responses to the peptide f-met-leu-phe. the
5- and 15-lipxygenase-derived metabolites of arachidonic
acid (including leukotrienes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids
and the lipoxins) were significantly inhibited by  xxxd77xxx 
(fig. 2), whereas the anti-cyclooxygenase activity of  xxxd77xxx , determined in vitro using homogenates of rat seminal
vesicles, was weak.
a single topical application of  xxxd208xxx  to the
mouse ear induces an inflammation attributable to both
lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase products [2]. the resulting edema can be inhibited by topical administration of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin
and weakly inhibited by the corticosteroid betamethasone
17-valerate. in this model of acute inflammation, topically
administered  xxxd77xxx  was found to have comparable activity to the reference substances indomethacin and betamethasone 17-valerate. under similar test conditions,
tretinoin was inactive. this suggests that  xxxd77xxx  may
have an advantage in the topical treatment of the inflammatory symptoms associated with acne vulgaris.
these results may explain how  xxxd77xxx  may reduce
the presence of mediators and cell functions known to induce vasodilatation, vascular permeability and leukocyte
migration in human skin and which are also elevated in various human cutaneous inflammatory disorders.

fig. 3. activity of  xxxd77xxx , tretinoin
and  xxxd77xxx  gel in the rhino mouse model of
comedolysis. topical application of  xxxd77xxx  leads to a reduction in the number of epidermal comedones and to an increase in epidermal thickness. the comedone profile is an
indication of comedone closure. each experiment used a control group of animals treated
with acetone alone. sc = stratum corneum;

gel has a creamy texture, due to the fact that the microcrystals of lipophilic  xxxd77xxx  are evenly dispersed in the
aqueous medium.

this well suited to the topical treatment of acne.
figure 4 shows the distribution of fluorescent  xxxd77xxx 
microcrystals in the skin after topical application of  xxxd77xxx  0.1% gel.  xxxd77xxx  microcrystals concentrate in the
follicle at the 2-hour time point. we observed that follicular
penetration occurred as early as 5 min after application and
that the penetration depth of the microcrystals in pilosebaceous structures seemed to be related to the application
time. after 2 h, microcrystals were even present in the follicle to a depth of 400 µm. a significant presence in the
pilosebaceous follicle [3] would permit treatment of microcomedones and prevent the formation of new noninflammatory or inflammatory lesions. once within the follicle, it
is likely that owing to its lipophilic nature,  xxxd77xxx  will
dissolve into the sebum, resulting in a loss of fluorescence.

microcrystals 5 min after in vitro topical
application to human skin (fluorescence

 xxxd77xxx  and the retinoid signaling pathway
retinoids exert their pronounced effect on gene expression by binding to the rar subtypes raralpha, -beta, -gamma, and
retinoid x receptor (rxr) subtypes rxralpha, -beta, -gamma are all
members of the ligand-activated  xxxg1594xxx 
superfamily. these receptors bind as heterodimers to specific response elements in the promoter region of retinoid-

sensitive genes [for review, see 14] and can act as transcriptional enhancers or repressors. in addition, rxr can
homodimerize or form heterodimers with other members of
the receptor superfamily such as the  xxxg2412xxx .
therefore, the response to a given retinoid within a given
cell type depends on the expression pattern of receptor subtypes and the nature of the cognate response elements.

at the molecular level,  xxxd77xxx  has a receptor affinity
profile distinct from that of tretinoin, in that it displays an
rarbeta, -gamma affinity profile and does not bind to cytoplasmic
retinoic-acid-binding protein (crabp). molecular modeling clearly shows that  xxxd77xxx  cannot dock efficiently
with  xxxg512xxx  as a result of steric hindrance occasioned
by the adamantyl function. this low affinity for  xxxg1938xxx 
and -ii may explain improved tolerance. this observation
was confirmed in a clinical pharmacology study in which a
solution of  xxxd77xxx  was applied under occlusion to
human skin for 4 days. the treatment did not lead to erythema or affect epidermal morphology on the adapalenetreated skin, but in contrast  xxxd3417xxx  induced erythema and epidermal hyperplasia and spongiosis under the
same conditions. the drugs were present at a sufficient concentration to achieve biochemical action as an early
indicator of retinoid action, namely  xxxg512xxx  mrna expression was observed in both cases [5].

 xxxd77xxx  for skin and the pilosebaceous unit and formulation technology resulting in a gel which is easy to apply and
comfortable for patients.
follicular penetration is observed with  xxxd77xxx  0.1%
gel. this is a clear advantage for the treatment of acne, as it
results in an enhanced concentration of  xxxd77xxx  at the site
of the disease. after 15 h contact with human skin in vitro,
0.01% of the applied dose was recovered in the receptor
fluid. as follicles represent only 0.1% of the skin surface
area, the follicular route does not appear to permit appreciable systemic exposure of topically applied  xxxd77xxx .
that the rargamma subtype is predominantly expressed in
the epidermis has been elegantly demonstrated by elder et
al. [6]. the role of the dermis must not be overlooked in
skin disease and since skin fibroblasts express rarbeta, gene
activation mediated through this receptor subtype should be
an added advantage in this molecule.
