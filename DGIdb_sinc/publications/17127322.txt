the role of the  xxxg529xxx  ( xxxg529xxx ) in disease.  granulocyte  xxxg526xxx  (g-csf) is a key regulator of granulopoiesis via stimulation of a specific cell-surface receptor, the  xxxg529xxx , found on hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as neutrophilic granulocytes. it is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that mutations of the  xxxg529xxx  has been implicated in several clinical settings that affect granulocytic differentiation, particularly severe congenital neutropenia, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. however, other studies suggest that signalling via the  xxxg529xxx  is also involved in a range of other malignancies. this review focuses on the molecular mechanisms through which the  xxxg529xxx  contributes to disease.
