connexins 43 and 37 in hypertensive rats
is rectified after 7-day carvedilol treatment

background: the aim of this study was to clarify the
response of endothelial connexins to hypertension and
antihypertensive drugs.
methods: rats remained normotensive (group 1, n ⫽
10) or were made hypertensive using n␻-nitro-l-arginine
methyl ester (l-name) (groups 2 to 4, n ⫽ 10/group).
seven weeks later groups 3 and 4 were respectively fed
atenolol or carvedilol daily for 7 days and the aortic
endothelial gap junctions were analyzed. in parallel the
effects of atenolol, carvedilol,  xxxd2435xxx ,  xxxd228xxx , and
 xxxd3521xxx  on connexin43 ( xxxg895xxx ) in human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (huvec) were compared.
results: endothelial  xxxg895xxx  was reduced by 35% and
cx37 by 59% in hypertensive rats (p ⬍ .001). the reduction was recovered fully by carvedilol but only partially by
atenolol (p ⬍ .05), although both drugs lowered the blood

h

pressure to similar levels. cx40 remained stationary in all
groups. in huvec, carvedilol (10 ␮g/ml) increased
 xxxg895xxx  protein expression by ⬎70% (p ⬍ .01), whereas
other drugs had minimal effects. the upregulation by
carvedilol was associated with increased transcripts and
decreased proteolysis of  xxxg895xxx .
conclusions: the study showed that l-name–induced hypertension has differential effects on endothelial
connexins, which respond variously to carvedilol and
atenolol. in huvec carvedilol directly upregulates endothelial  xxxg895xxx  and the effect is independent of its antioxidant
activity. am j hypertens 2006;19:129 –135 © 2006

ypertension is intimately associated with endothelial dysfunction.1 maintenance of the functional integrity of endothelium requires metabolic
cooperation between the neighboring cells, in which direct
intercellular communication via gap junctions plays an
essential role.2,3 gap junctions are cell membrane protein
channels made of connexin molecules, which belong to a
multigene family. in mammals, arterial endothelial cells
are reported to express connexin37 (cx37), cx40, and
 xxxg895xxx .4,5 previous studies have shown that individual endothelial connexins are altered by a variety of factors6 – 8
including certain types of hypertension as well as antihypertensive drugs.9 –12 in this study we examined the expression of aortic endothelial gap junctions in rats with n␻- xxxd2741xxx -arginine methyl ester (l-name)–induced hypertension
and compared the effects of antihypertensive drugs atenolol

and carvedilol, two adrenergic blockers, on the gap junctions.
the comparison was also conducted in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec), which predominately
express  xxxg895xxx .13

the work was conducted in accordance with the roc
animal protection law (scientific application of animals), 1998. a total of 40 male sprague-dawley rats, 3
months of age, were divided equally into four groups.
group 1 rats were given normal drinking water. groups 2
to 4 rats were made hypertensive by adding l-name (0.4
g/l; sigma, st. louis, mo) in the drinking water for 8

weeks. at the end of week 7, groups 3 and 4 respectively
received, by gavage for 7 days, atenolol (100 mg/kg/day)
or carvedilol (50 mg/kg/day); the doses of both were
according to the previous reports.14,15 tail-artery blood
pressure (bp) was measured for each animal using the
ur-5000 automatic sphygmomanometer (ueda inc., tokyo, japan). at the end of experiments all animals were
anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and underwent perfusion fixation as previously described.5 the descending thoracic aortae were
dissected and cut into transverse rings for rapid freezing
and stored under liquid nitrogen.

confocal laser scanning microscopy
immunostained samples were examined by confocal laser
scanning microscopy using a leica tcs sp (wetzlar,
germany). single-connexin-labeled arterial samples were
used for semiquantification of endothelial gap junctions.
after the signal on the top of the sample was observed, the
images were collected using the ⫻40 objective lens. each
image recorded consisted of 1024 ⫻ 1024 pixels, and
projection views of consecutive optical sections taken at
0.4-␮m intervals through the full thickness of endothelial
connexin signal were recorded for analysis.

cell culture and drug treatment

western blotting method

the huvec were isolated and passaged as previously
described.16 the culture medium was made of medium
199 (gibco; grand island, ny) supplemented with fetal
calf serum (20%; hyclone, logan, utah), heparin (50
␮g/ml; sigma), glutamax (1%; gibco), penicillin (100
u/ml; gibco), streptomycin (100 ␮g/ml; gibco), and
 xxxg786xxx  (0.1 unit/ml; sigma). cells
of passage 3 or 4 were used in the subsequent experiments.
first the confluent cells were treated for 24 h with each
of carvedilol (kindly donated by f. hoffmann-la roche,
switzerland), atenolol (kindly donated by synmosa biopharma, taiwan),  xxxd2435xxx  (glaxosmithkline, london, england),  xxxd228xxx  (sigma), and  xxxd3521xxx  (sigma). second,
cells were treated with n-acetyl-leu-leu-norleu-al (alln)
plus leupeptin (2.5 ⫻ 10⫺5 mol/l for each; both from
sigma), protease inhibitors reported to block the degradation
of  xxxg895xxx  protein.17 carvedilol (10 ␮g/ml) was added 1 h later
and the incubation continued for another 24 h.

immunoblotting was conducted as previously described.16
in brief, 20 ␮g of sample was loaded in each lane, resolved
by 12% sodium  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf) membrane (amersham,
buckinghamshire, england). the membrane was then
probed for  xxxg895xxx  and visualized using cdp-star substrate
solution (tropix, massachusetts). finally the membranes
were stripped with 2% sds, 0.7% 2- xxxd26xxx , and
0.1 mol/l tris-hcl and were probed with a mouse anti␤-actin antibody (1:20000; chemicon).

immunocytochemistry
antisera cx37(r382) and cx40( xxxd637xxx ) were used to detect
cx37 and cx407,18 for  xxxg895xxx , a murine monoclonal antibody (bd transduction laboratories, san jose, california) was used. in addition, a rabbit polyclonal antibody
against  xxxg2423xxx  (anti-vwf; dako, glostrup,
denmark) was used for identification of endothelial cells.
for secondary antibody/detection systems, donkey antimouse, anti-rabbit, and anti– guinea pig immunoglobulin
conjugated either to fitc or cy3 (chemicon, temecula,
california) were used.
immunolabeling procedures were as previously described.7,16 in brief, after incubated first with anti-cx37,
anti-cx40, or anti- xxxg895xxx  (1:250 for each, 37°c, 2 h) and
then cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, room
temperature, 1 h), the arterial rings were cut open and
mounted for en face viewing of endothelial cells. for
huvec, cells were fixed with ⫺20°c methanol, incubated with a mixture of anti- xxxg895xxx  (1:250) plus anti-vwf
(1:500) followed by a mixture of the two corresponding
species-specific secondary antibodies (fitc, 1:50; cy3,
1:500) and then treated with bisbenzamide (1 ␮g/ml;
sigma).

northern blotting method
northern blotting was conducted as previously described.19 in brief, 20 ␮g of total rna was hybridized
with a digoxigenin-labeled fragment of the human  xxxg895xxx 
coding region (kindly given by prof. n.j. severs and dr.
e. dupont, national heart and lung institute, imperial
college london, england).20 signal was detected using
alkaline phosphatase– conjugated anti-digoxigenin fab
fragments (roche) and developed using cdp-star substrate solution. finally the membrane was stripped and
probed for the human  xxxg861xxx .
analysis
analysis of confocal images from single-connexin–labeled arterial samples was undertaken using qwin image
analysis software (leica, heidelberg, germany). for each
animal two arterial rings were used. from each arterial
ring four randomly selected fields were analyzed. mean
values (⫾sd) of the total area of immunolabeled gap
junctions, expressed as percentage of the luminal surface
area, were obtained for each group.
for northern and western blotting, densitometric scanning and analysis were performed on the blots using
imagemaster (amersham pharmacia biotech, new jersey). data were averaged from at least four separate experiments.
data are expressed as mean ⫾ sd. all data were
compared statistically by analysis of variance and t test.

discussion
this study demonstrated that in rats with l-name–induced hypertension endothelial  xxxg895xxx  and cx37 was
downregulated, and that the downregulation was better
recovered by 7-day treatment with carvedilol than with
atenolol, although both drugs lowered bp to similar levels.
in addition, in huvec carvedilol upregulated  xxxg895xxx  gap
junctions, whereas other adrenergic blockers and antioxidants had minimal effects. all of these novel findings not
only substantially expand current knowledge regarding the
relationship among endothelial connexins, hypertension,
and antihyertensive drugs, but also have important clinical
implications.
in the hypertensive animals in the present study, the
dose ratio of atenolol (100 mg/kg/day) versus carvedilol
(50 mg/kg/day) is identical to that recommended in the
guidelines for human hypertension (daily maximal dose:
atenolol, 100 mg; carvedilol, 50 mg).21 regarding the cell
culture experiments, these two drugs in previous studies
were often compared at the same molar concentrations,22,23 and doses of ⬎10 ␮g/ml carvedilol (mw
406.47) were used.24 in our animal studies, because the
dose in milligrams of atenolol (mw 266.34) was higher
than that of carvedilol, in the cell culture experiments we
compared the two drugs in micrograms per milliliter,

133

which in molar concentration made atenolol nearly 50%
higher than carvedilol.
early ultrastructural studies and recent immunolabeling
experiments demonstrated that the response of endothelial
gap junctions and connexins differed in hypertensive animals of various models.9 –12,25 this heterogeneity in response occurs even in different arteries of the same model,
for example in the mesenteric artereries and tail artery of
spontaneously hypertensive rats.9,10 in addition, the
change of connexins in response to hypertension can be
minimal.11 compared with the above-mentioned reports,
the pattern of endothelial connexin response in l-name–
induced hypertension, as shown in the present study, is
unique.
an important finding from the present study is that the
response of endothelial connexins to hypertension is completely reversed after 7-day administration of carvedilol.
the treatment period is much shorter than periods reported
in spontaneously hypertensive rats with enalapril (1
month)12 and candesartan (3 months).9 therefore, the
present study demonstrates that the effect of antihypertensive drugs on endothelial connexins can appear within
days.
in pharmacologic terms carvedilol, compared with
atenolol, possesses a variety of properties other than ␤-adrenergic blockade, such as ␣-adrenergic blockade and
antioxidation.26 in the cultured cells we therefore simultaneously examined the effects of  xxxd2435xxx  (an ␣- plus
␤-adrenergic blocker, like carvedilol) and vitamins c and
e (anti-oxidants) on endothelial  xxxg895xxx  expression, in addition to carvedilol and atenolol. through these comparisons the upregulating effect of carvedilol on endothelial
 xxxg895xxx  was found to be not likely attributable to the properties of ␣- plus ␤-adrenergic blockade or antioxidation,
because such an effect is not seen for  xxxd2435xxx  nor the
vitamins. on the other hand, in vitro studies had shown
that both proteosome and lysosome are involved in the
degradation of  xxxg895xxx  gap junctions.17 if these two pathways of proteolysis are inhibited by carvedilol, there will
be less degradation of  xxxg895xxx  protein, that is, more content
of  xxxg895xxx  gap junctions in the endothelial cells. to investigate this possibility that the inhibition of the two pathways contributes to the upregulation of  xxxg895xxx  gap
junctions, we examined the effect of leupeptin (a lysosomal inhibitor) and alln (a proteosomal inhibitor) in
huvec. the results showed that in the cells treated with
carvedilol, the addition of leupeptin and alln does not
further increase the amount of  xxxg895xxx . this indicates that
carvedilol possesses the properties of leupeptin and
alln. therefore the mechanisms underlying the upregulation of  xxxg895xxx  by carvedilol can be attributed partly to the
inhibition of the proteolysis of the protein. other potential
mechanisms include upregulation at the mrna level, as
shown by the northern blotting, with a possibility of more
synthesis of  xxxg895xxx  protein by carvedilol.
carvedilol has been reported to prevent endothelial
dysfunction,27 in which the endothelium-dependent vaso-

134

hypertension, endothelial connexins, and carvedilol

dilatory function is impaired.28 recent evidence indicates
that induction of vasodilation by endothelium-derived
hyperpolarizing factor (edhf) occurs mainly through
gap junctions.29 therefore the findings in the present
study that carvedilol upregulates  xxxg895xxx  gap junctions
may contribute to its beneficial effects on endothelial
dysfunction by providing more channels (so-called
myoendothelial gap junctions) for passage of edhf to
the subjacent medial smooth muscle. although connexin make-up of the myoendothelial gap junctions in
rats remains unclear, a recent in vitro study suggested
that cx37 may not comprise the myoendothelial gap
junctions.30 further studies are required to confirm the
effect of carvedilol on edhf-mediated vasodilation as
well as the role of each endothelial connexin in the
myoendothelial gap junctions.
in conclusion, in the rat aorta, hypertension induced by
l-name is associated with a marked reduction of endothelial  xxxg895xxx  and cx37 gap junctions, which are better
rectified by 7-day treatment with carvedilol treatment
compared with atenolol. in the cultured cells, carvedilol
upregulates  xxxg895xxx  gap junctions. the effect is associated
with the inhibition of the proteolysis pathway and enhancement of the upstream mrna but cannot be explained
by its adrenergic blocking or antioxidant properties. whether
the effect of carvedilol on the gap junctions contributes to its
ability to correct endothelial dysfunction require further
experiments.
