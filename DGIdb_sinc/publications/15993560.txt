abstract introduction: angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) shares structural
homology with the matrix metalloproteinase family of proteolytic enzymes (mmps)
responsible for degradation of the extracellular matrix (ecm). ace inhibitors have
been reported to protect against cancer in patients. the aim of this study was to
determine whether the ace inhibitor, captopril, could impair the activity of mmps
and impact on tumour invasion and growth in a cell line and murine model.
methods: for proof of principle, the protein activity of human  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx 
produced by the ht1080 fibrosarcoma cell line was detected using gelatin
zymography. gene expression was determined by real time reverse transcriptase
pcr and tumour cell invasion using matrigele invasion chambers. the effect of
captopril on the in vivo growth of mglva-1 human gastric adenocarcinoma
xenografts was evaluated in a nude mouse model.
results: captopril inhibited activity of secreted  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1428xxx , however, gene
expression in ht1080 remained unaltered. invasion of ht1080 cells was inhibited by
48% (p!0.001). tumour size was reduced by 40–50% with 0.4 mg/ml captopril (p!
0.01) and when combined with cisplatin the inhibition increased to 71% (p!0.05).
discussion: ace inhibitors inhibit the activity of secreted  xxxg1428xxx  and -9 by a mechanism
similar to synthetic mmp inhibitors. ace inhibitors have previously been shown to inhibit
tumour growth, however; this is the first study to demonstrate inhibition of a human
gastric xenograft, both alone and in combination with cisplatin. these results support
further investigation into the anticancer effects of ace inhibitors.

captopril inhibition of tumour growth
the homoestasis of blood pressure, is a bivalent
dipeptidyl carboxyl metalloproteinase. this
enzyme originates from a large evolutionary
family of metallopeptidases, the majority of
which, ace included, contain zinc and employ
a hexxh zinc binding motif at their active site.
other enzymes in this family structurally similar
to ace include the interstitial collagenases,
members of the matrix metalloproteinase family
of enzymes.1,2
the matrix metalloproteinases are responsible
for physiological and pathological remodelling of
the extracellular matrix (ecm) and are collectively
capable of degrading most of, if not all, the
constituent components of the ecm.3,4 in cancer,
it is well known that matrix degradation by mmps is
critical for angiogenesis,5–7 tumour invasion8,9 and
metastasis.10,11 in many solid cancers, mmps have
been shown to be over-expressed either by tumour
cells or more commonly by stromal fibroblasts.12,13
furthermore, in certain cancers including gastric
cancer, the extent of mmp expression has been
shown to correlate with tumour grade or stage.14,15
ecm degradation by mmps is a complex process
generating matrix breakdown products that exhibit
angioregulatory properties. 16,17 furthermore,
matrix metalloproteinases may also influence cell
growth by releasing matrix bound growth factors
such as heparin bound  xxxg681xxx  (hbegf).4,18,19 thus, mmps may promote the growth of
tumours directly or facilitate tumour growth by
stimulating angiogenesis, a pre-requisite for the
growth of tumours beyond a size of 1–2 mm.20
mmp inhibition has been shown to reduce
angiogenesis, tumour growth, invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in in vivo animal models.8,21–
24
as such mmp inhibition represents a therapeutic
target and a number of synthetic mmp inhibitors
have been developed. in general, these compounds
inhibit the activity of mmps by binding the zinc
moiety of the enzyme’s active site in the same way
as their naturally occurring tissue inhibitors or
timps.25,26 the activity of ace is inhibited in exactly
the same fashion by classical ace inhibitors, that is
to say by chelating the zinc atom present in the
active site of ace.27 given that ace and the mmps
share ancestory, structural homology and mechanism of inhibition it is conceivable that drugs
designed to inhibit ace may have inhibitory activity
against the mmps. indeed, recent in vitro and in vivo
studies have confirmed the inhibition of mammalian
mmps by ace inhibitors.28–31
furthermore, prontera et al. demonstrated
inhibition of in vivo growth and metastasis of
lewis lung carcinoma cells in mice treated with

1043
captopril, which was comparable to that seen with
the mmp inhibitor  xxxd287xxx .29
the hypothesis of these studies is that ace
inhibitors reduce; the activity of human matrix
metalloproteinases, the capacity of human tumour
cells for invasion and the growth of gastric
adenocarcinoma.
the aim of this study, therefore, was to
determine whether ace inhibitors are capable of
inhibiting human matrix metalloproteinases and in
turn inhibit tumour invasion and the growth of
human gastric cancer in a murine model.

methods
materials
captopril was purchased from sigma-aldrich
(sigma-aldrich, gillingham, dorset, uk).

cell lines and culture conditions
the human gastric poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cell line mglva1 was chosen for its clinical
relevance in terms of its ability to metastasise and
grow causing ascites and its sensitivity to cisplatin.32 mglva1 is known to express mmps in vivo,
however, in vitro expression is poor precluding the
use of this cell line for in vitro studies. to prove
point of principle, the human fibrosarcoma cell line
ht1080 which secretes  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1428xxx  (pro and
active forms) in vitro was used as a source for
human mmps during in vitro studies, including cell
invasion assays. human  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  were
produced by conditioning serum free medium (1:1
hams f12: rpmi 1640) without mmp containing
foetal calf serum conditioned by culture with (1!
106) ht1080 cells for a period of 24 h.

gelatin zymography
the activity of secreted  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  were
analysed by gelatin zymography using the basic
method previously described by brown et al.33 and
adapted by prontera et al.29 this method has the
advantage of allowing covisualisation of active and
inactive forms of mmps, but is only semi-quantitative.
direct inhibition of secreted mmps present in unsupplemented conditioned medium was assessed by
adding captopril to the overnight incubation in
zymogram developing buffer. each experiment was
performed in triplicate and the gels analysed using
semi-quantitive densitometry. the ability to detect
mmp inhibition by this method was confirmed by the

1044
use of the hydroxamate mmp inhibitor a4336
(sigma-aldrich).

mtt proliferation assay
captopril cytotoxicity was assessed using mtt
proliferation assays that provide an indirect indicator of mammalian cell survival and proliferation
by assessing mitochondrial oxidative capacity.34 for
a panel of gi cell lines, the mtt uptake has
previously been shown to correlate with an increase
in cell number.35 1!104 cells were seeded into
each of the inner 60 wells of a 96 well plate and
treated as above, with serum free medium supplemented with captopril at a range of doses for
24 h. the medium was aspirated and wells washed
prior to incubation with mtt and the addition of
dmso (dimethyl sulphoxide) (sigma). the resulting
colour change is proportional to mitochondrial
activity and was analysed using a multiwell
colorimetric plate reader (dynatech lab, uk) at a
wavelength of 570 nm. at least 10 wells/plate were
used for each condition and experiments repeated
five times.

reverse-transcriptase real time pcr
ht1080 cells (1!106) treated with captopril for
24 h were harvested and snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen. total cellular rna was extracted using
rnazol-b (biogenesis, poole, dorset, uk) by a
method described previously.36 dna was generated from random hexamer primers by reverse
transcription using superscripte ii rt reagents
(gibcobrl, uk) using the method described by
mclaughlin et al. 37 pcr primer pairs were
designed to amplify human  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  for
real time analysis of mmp gene expression relative
to expression of the housekeeping gene  xxxg861xxx .
the number of cycles required for the cumulative
fluorescence of sybr green to reach an arbitrary
threshold was recorded and the relative
expression of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  to  xxxg861xxx 
determined. each sample was repeated twice
and experiments performed in triplicate.

invasion assays
in vitro invasion assays were performed using bd
biocoate matrigele invasion chambers (becton
dickinson labware, bedford, ma). 2.5!105 serum
starved ht1080 cells were seeded into the insert of
the modified boyden chamber. this assay allows a
simplistic assessment of migration through a simple
cell-free medium. chemoattractant medium

r.n. williams et al.
conditioned by the mouse fibroblast cell line
nih3t3 was added to the lower well. cells were
treated with captopril for 24 h at a range of
concentrations. plates were incubated at 37 8c for
24 h following which the number of invading cells
were stained and counted. non-invading cells were
removed from the top of the membrane using a
cotton tipped swab and the invading cells on the
under surface of the membrane fixed in ice-cold
methanol for 30 min. invading cells were then
stained with 1 mg/ml  xxxd3027xxx  and mounted
on slides using aqueous mounting medium. slides
were viewed at 40 times magnification using a
microscope with an ultraviolet light source. the
numbers of invading cells/field of view were
counted and for each well, a total of 20 fields
were counted. experiments were performed in
triplicate.

in vivo xenograft models
the use of nude mice allows study of the growth of
human tumours in animal models providing a better
insight into possible anti-tumour effects on human
cancers than the use of a non-human tumour cell
line. the complex interplay of tumour stroma
reaction in this model provides a more realistic
model of tumour growth than isolated cell line
model would otherwise give. however, due to the
lack of t-cells, the contribution made by the
immune system is not assessed. mglva1 gastric
xenograft tissue from donor animals was grafted
subcutaneously into 6–8 week old female nude mice
as previously described.38 the use of subcutaneous
implantation facilitates continuous assessment of
tumour growth, but the heterotropic position
remains artificial. captopril, 0.4 mg/ml, was administered in the drinking water every other day for a
period of 10 days, a schedule adopted from that of
hii et al. 39 cross-sectional tumour area was
measured using callipers and mice terminated
when tumour burden reached a cross sectional
area of 250 mm2. subsequently, further in vivo
studies were undertaken using captopril in combination with cisplatin. in these studies, tumour cross
sectional area in control mice was compared to that
of mice treated with captopril, cisplatin or captopril and cisplatin given in combination. cisplatin
was administered at a dose of 4 mg/kg by intravenous injection on days 1, 4, 7 and 10, a schedule
reflecting patient use and in the range used
previously in gastric cancer xenograft models.40
ukcccr guidelines were adhered to throughout
animal experimentation.

captopril inhibition of tumour growth

hplc quantification of serum captopril
concentration
the pharmacokinetics of captopril are complex.
within the plasma a significant proportion of
captopril reversibly forms a symmetrical disulphide, it also dynamically forms mixed disulphide
compounds with other thiols such as cysteine or
glutathione.41 in this study, serum captopril and
captopril disulphide concentrations were quantified
by hplc. serum, collected at termination from
animals treated in the in vivo experiments, was
homogenised in 0.1% phosphoric acid and methanol
(60/40 v/v) (ph 2.2g0.05) and transferred via a
pharmassuree supor 1.2 mm (gelman sciences) and
an acrodiscw 0.2 mm filter (gelman sciences)
successively. each sample was assayed in duplicate
using an agilent 1100 lc3d system running chemstation a.09.01. a waters symmetry c18 5 mm 3.9!
150 mm2 column set at 40 8c was used for the
separation of the specific analytes from other
elutants.

metabolism, and ,therefore, indirectly on proliferation, was determined using mtt assays. the
proliferation of ht1080 was not significantly
inhibited by doses of captopril between 500 nm
and 1 mm but was reduced by 14% (p!0.03) and 46%
(p!0.001) at captopril concentrations of 5 and
10 mm, respectively, (fig. 3(b)).
real time reverse transcriptase pcr for  xxxg1428xxx 
and  xxxg1440xxx  mrna expression was performed on
ht1080 cells treated with 5 mm captopril. the
expression of  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1428xxx  was not significantly altered by treatment with 5 mm captopril
(data not shown).
the effect of captopril on the in vitro invasion of
ht1080 cells through synthetic ecm was determined using matrigele invasion chambers. cells
were treated with 1, 5 and 10 mm captopril for a
period of 24 h and the number of invading cells
counted and compared to untreated controls.
captopril inhibited the invasion of ht1080 through
matrigel in a dose dependent manner, maximal
inhibition was induced by 10 mm captopril (fig. 4).
ht1080 invasion through matrigel was reduced by
29, 42 and 48% by 1, 5 and 10 mm captopril,
respectively, (p!0.001).

cell line studies

animal models

the effect of captopril on the gelatinolytic activity
of secreted human  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1428xxx  was determined zymographically (fig. 1). captopril was
found to inhibit the activity of  xxxg1440xxx  and the pro
and active forms of  xxxg1428xxx  in a dose dependent
fashion. complete inhibition of 62 kda active  xxxg1428xxx 
was achieved by 1 mm captopril. densitometric
quantification of mmp inhibition by captopril is
shown in fig. 2. similar results were achieved using
enalaprilat, the active form of enalapril (data not
shown).
mmp producing ht1080 cells were also treated
with captopril for 24 h at a range of concentrations
(1–10 mm).  xxxg1440xxx , pro- xxxg1428xxx , and  xxxg1428xxx  activity
were reduced by 39, 47 and 34%, and 60, 87, and
82% by the treatment with 5 and 10 mm captopril,
respectively, (p!0.05, fig. 3(a)).

combination study with mice treated with either
captopril or cisplatin alone, or in combination,
relative to untreated controls and mono-therapy. in
this study, inhibition of tumour growth by captopril
was more marked with a 54% (p!0.05) reduction in
mean tumour cross sectional area by day 17. the
reduction in tumour cross sectional area in response
to treatment by captopril was almost identical to

that achieved with the use of cisplatin with a 55%
reduction in tumour cross sectional area on day 17
relative to control (p!0.05). on day 17, combination therapy resulted in  xxxd2051xxx % (p!0.05)
reduction in tumour cross sectional area in comparison to control and a 36 and 35% reduction,
compared to captopril or cisplatin, respectively,
although this did not reach statistical significance
from either monotherapy.
total serum captopril concentrations (captopril
and captopril disulphide) were determined for
treated mice using hplc. free captopril was largely
undetectable in the sera of mice following termination, therefore, the total serum captopril concentration approximates the concentration of captopril
disulphide, which ranged between 0 and 7.7 mg/ml
with a mean and median concentration of 1.7 and
1.1 mg/ml, respectively. in molar terms this
equates to a mean total captopril concentration
of 7.8 mm and a maximum concentration of 35.4 mm.

discussion
the importance of degradation of the ecm by
matrix metalloproteinases during tumour invasion,
metastasis and angiogenesis has long since been
established. furthermore, the production of angiogenic peptides and release of matrix bound growth
factors by mmps may also contribute to tumour
growth. as such, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase activity and the resulting interruption of
tumour biology represents a possible therapeutic

target. natural and synthetic inhibitors of mmps
bind the zinc moiety within the enzyme’s active
site, which is similar to the mechanism seen with
ace inhibition by ace inhibitors, such as captopril.
the activity of human secreted  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx 
was inhibited by captopril at concentrations ranging
from high mm to mm doses. this level of inhibition by
captopril corresponds to that reported in previous
studies using mmps secreted by both the murine
lewis-lung-carcinoma and bovine endothelial
cells.28,29 in this study, a human fibrosarcoma cell
line was used as the source for  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx .
however, the above results demonstrate reduced
expression of active mmps in an acellular

1047
environment by ace inhibitors. this is likely to
represent inhibition of the enzyme active site in a
fashion similar to that achieved by natural synthetic
mmp inhibitors. the structure of individual human
mmps is identical regardless of the cell line
producing it. therefore, the fact that a fibrosarcoma cell line was used as a source for mmps in this
study is irrelevant and captopril should demonstrate an inhibitory effect on mmps produced by any
human cell type. this argument is supported by
evidence of captopril-induced inhibition of mmps
produced by human glioma cells.42
the presence of the mmps within a polyacrylamide-gelatin gel necessitates high concentrations
of captopril in order to provide adequate penetration of the gel complex.43 thus, the high doses
of captopril needed to produce mmp inhibition in
this and other studies may represent an underestimation of the true inhibitory effect of the drug.
despite differences in the functional group of ace
inhibitors, similar levels of mmp inhibition were
seen with captopril and enalaprilat, suggesting a
class rather than idiosyncratic drug effect.
treatment of mmp producing human fibrosarcoma cells with captopril, resulted in a subsequent
reduction in the gelatinolytic activity of conditioned medium, indicating a possible effect on
mmp production. however, at these high doses
captopril was found to inhibit proliferation of
ht1080 cells. although this could account for
these findings, the reduction in mmp activity
produced by captopril treatment was much more
marked than its’ effects on proliferation. indeed,
studies performed by the authors using ht1080 cells
treated with cisplatin at an ic50 dose, revealed that
 xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1428xxx  activity was inhibited by only
25.7 and 24.9%, respectively, (data not shown). in
comparison 10 mm captopril inhibited  xxxg1440xxx ,  xxxg1428xxx , and cell proliferation by 60.1, 82.3, and 46%,
respectively. thus, the inhibition of  xxxg1440xxx  and
 xxxg1428xxx  activity produced by captopril is considerably higher than that observed with cisplatin and is,
therefore, unlikely to purely result from changes in
cell proliferation.
prontera et al. reported that millimolar doses of
captopril could inhibit mmp gene transcription in
murine lewis-lung-carcinoma cells.29 however, in
contrast to these findings, captopril did not inhibit
mmp gene transcription in human fibrosarcoma cells
as determined by real time reverse transcriptase
pcr in the present study. therefore, any reduction
in mmp production by ht1080 cells in response to
captopril must result from changes at a posttranscriptional level.
overall the presence or absence of an inhibitory
effect on mmp production may be unimportant,

1048
providing that enzyme activity is sufficiently
suppressed by treatment with an ace inhibitor to
alter mmp functionality and thus tumour invasion.
to determine whether captopril treatment could
result in a reduction in functional mmp activity, the
invasion of mmp producing ht1080 cells through a
synthetic ecm was quantified using matrigele
assays. inhibition of mmp activity was found to
translate into a functional reduction in tumour cell
invasion, which was significantly inhibited by 1, 5
and 10 mm captopril. it is important to note that
tumour cell invasion was inhibited by doses of
captopril that had no effect on tumour cell
proliferation. these findings correspond to those
described by nakagawa et al. who reported that
captopril inhibited both gelatinolytic activity and
the in vitro invasion of mmp producing t98g glioma
cells.42 furthermore, captopril has been shown to
effectively inhibit in vitro invasion of a number of
other primary brain tumours.44 nakagawa demonstrated that mmp inhibition by captopril could be
reversed by the addition of excess zinc.42 the
addition of zinc, also abrogated the reduction in
glioma cell invasion, supporting the hypothesis that
mmp inhibition was responsible for the effects of
captopril on invasion. moreover, these findings
suggest that mmp inhibition by captopril is not
cell-type-specific and is mediated by sequestration
of the zinc ion at the enzyme’s active site.
captopril significantly inhibited the growth of
human mglva-1 tumours grown an in vivo murine
model. the extent of growth inhibition produced by
captopril was similar to that seen with the
chemotherapy agent cisplatin. furthermore, in
combination captopril and cisplatin were more
effective at inhibiting the growth of gastric
carcinoma cells than either agent alone. our
findings compliment those of hii et al. the only
other study reported using an ace inhibitor in a
human tumour xenograft model.39 in their study,
captopril was found to significantly inhibit the
growth of human renal cell carcinoma orthotopically implanted in scid mice. other in vivo studies
using non-human tumours have shown growth
inhibition in response to treatment by classical
ace inhibitors. yoshiji et al. showed that the ace
inhibitors perindopril,  xxxd3305xxx , and captopril all
displayed an inhibitory effect on the development
of murine hepatocellular carcinoma.45 furthermore, perindopril was also found to inhibit the
growth of established tumours. captopril has been
shown to inhibit the growth of both syngeneic rat
sarcoma28 and murine lung carcinoma.29 in the
latter study, captopril was more effective than the
mmp inhibitor,  xxxd287xxx  at retarding tumour
growth. moreover, captopril treatment reduced

r.n. williams et al.
the number of spontaneous lung metastases nearly
as effectively as  xxxd287xxx . whilst none of these
models are perfect; using a heterogenous tumour
site (as in this study), or reliance on non-human
tumours there does appear to be a growing body of
evidence to support an anti-mmp and anti-tumour
effect with a variety of ace inhibitors using
different animal models.
unfortunately, the mm concentrations of captopril required to inhibit mmp activity and tumour cell
invasion in this, and other studies, are not in the
clinically achievable mm serum concentration
range.39 however, as previously mentioned, in vitro
analysis of mmp inhibition may underestimate the
inhibitory potential of ace inhibitors as high doses
are required to penetrate the polyacrylamidegelatin gel complex.42 therefore, hplc analysis
was performed in order to determine the approximate range of captopril concentrations achieved
during the in vivo experiments. analysis of serum
captopril concentrations is difficult owing to the
drug’s instability in that it forms disulphide bridges
with itself and other proteins.41 however, hplc
analysis of serum from treated mice showed the
mean total captopril concentration was 7.8 mm with
a maximum concentration of 35.4 mm. overall, it
would appear that in vivo captopril is capable of
inhibiting the growth of human gastric adenocarcinoma cells at doses much lower than that required
for in vitro mmp inhibition. coker et al. demonstrated that mmp activity was increased when
porcine cardiac myocytes were treated with 1 mm
 xxxg99xxx , suggesting that mmp activity may be
stimulated by  xxxg99xxx .46 thus, it is conceivable that in vivo, in addition to direct mmp
inhibition, ace inhibitors may reduce mmp activity
by blocking the stimulation of mmps by angiotensin
ii. further studies are required to delineate the
exact mechanistic pathways for the apparent antitumour effect of ace inhibitors.
the use of ace inhibitors for the treatment of
cardiovascular disease has become widespread and
epidemiological evidence exists to support an
anticancer role for ace inhibitors. in a retrospective cohort study of 5207 hypertensive
patients, lever et al. found that the relative risk
of incident and fatal cancer for patients taking ace
inhibitors compared to patients on other antihypertensive medications, included in the study,
was reduced (rr of 0.72 compared to 1.10 and fatal
cancer risk 0.05 compared to 1.03).47 moreover, the
reduction in risk was increased in patients taking
ace inhibitors for over 3 years.
engineering sufficiently robust clinical trials to
explore the use of ace inhibitors as anticancer
agents will be a challenge but in view of the minimal

captopril inhibition of tumour growth
morbidity associated with these drugs such an
approach is worthy of further investigation.
