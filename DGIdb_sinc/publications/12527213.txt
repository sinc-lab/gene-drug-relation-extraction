abstract
toll-like receptors (tlrs) are type i transmembrane proteins involved in innate immunity by recognizing microbial conserved
structures. recent studies have shown that  xxxg2289xxx  recognizes dsrna, a viral product, whereas  xxxg2293xxx  recognizes unmethylated cpg
motifs frequently found in the genome of bacteria and viruses, but not vertebrates.  xxxg2291xxx  recognizes small synthetic immune
modifiers including  xxxd2339xxx , r-848, loxoribine, and bropirimine, all of which are already applied or promising for clinical use
against viral infections and cancers. plasmacytoid dendritic cells express  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2293xxx , and respond to  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2293xxx  ligands
by producing a large amount of interferon (ifn-a). these results indicate that  xxxg2289xxx ,  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2293xxx  may play an important role
in detecting and combating viral infections.

1. introduction
the immune system in vertebrates comprises innate
and acquired immunity, both of which work cooperatively to protect the host from microbial infections.
acquired immunity is characterized by specificity and
memory, and exerted by t and b lymphocytes. each
lymphocyte expresses a cell surface receptor with a
single specificity, which is generated by somatic recombination during maturation. however, since initiation of
acquired immunity usually takes several days to occur,
innate immunity is the first line of the host defense
against bacterial growth and spread in the early phase of
infection. the major players of innate immunity are
phagocytes such as macrophages, neutrophils and
dendritic cells (dcs). the primary role of these cells
was formerly thought to be phagocytosis of pathogens
in a non-specific manner, digestion of these, and
presentation of pathogen-derived antigens to t cells.
this response was also called the non-specific immune
response. however, recent identification of toll-like

receptors (tlrs) has changed that notion. it has been
revealed that innate immunity can recognize conserved
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps)
through tlrs expressed on the cell surface of immune
cells [1 /3]. recognition of invading pathogens then
triggers cytokine production and upregulation of costimulatory molecules in phagocytes, leading to activation
of t cells. thus, innate immunity is closely linked to
acquired immunity.

1.1. pathogen recognition by mammalian toll-like
receptors
toll is a type i  xxxg1608xxx  in drosophila .
the extracellular domain contains leucine-rich repeat
(lrr) whereas the cytoplasmic domain shows striking
homology with that of il-rs, and is referred to as toll/
 xxxg1171xxx  (tir) domain. the toll gene was identified as a
gene essential for the dorsal-ventral development in the
drosophila embryo. toll receptor signaling is initiated
by binding of an endogenous peptide ligand, termed
spatzle. spatzle is synthesized as an inactive precursor
protein that is cleaved by the protease easter. easter is
also generated from the precursor protein in a series of
protease activation cascade. triggering of toll receptor

causes recruitment to the membrane of the adapter tube
and the protein kinase pelle, and finally leads to
activation of the  xxxg1559xxx -like proteins, dorsal. subsequently, toll signaling has been shown to play an
essential role in the immune response to microbial
infection [4,5]. in adult drosophila , microbial infection
promptly induces production of a battery of antimicrobial peptides in the fat body, which is functionally

equivalent to the liver in mammals. antimicrobial
peptides are categorized into antifungal and antibacterial peptides. interestingly, the genes of these two groups
of peptides are differentially regulated depending on the
invading pathogen. toll-mutant flies show compromised induction of antifungal peptide but not antibacterial peptides, and are highly sensitive to fungal
infection, but not to bacterial infection. on the other
hand, the immune-deficiency (imd) pathway is involved
in the induction of antibacterial peptides [6]. imd
mutants do not produce antibacterial peptides and are
highly susceptible to gram-negative bacterial infection.
the toll and imd pathways do not share any signaling
components. the imd gene has recently been identified
and has been shown to encode an adaptor protein with
homology to the mammalian rip. at present the
receptor involved in this pathway remains unclear.
toll receptors are evolutionarily conserved and their
homologs are found in insects, plants and mammals. to
date ten tlrs have been identified in humans and
mouse, respectively [1]. the essential role of drosophila
toll in antifungal response suggested that mammalian
tlrs also participate in innate immunity. in fact, tlrs
have been found to be essential for microbial recognition (table 1).

1.1.1. tlr4
lipopolysaccharide (lps) is an integral component of
the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria and a
potent activator of macrophages as a causative agent of
endotoxic shock. structurally, lps is a complex glycolipid composed of a hydrophilic polysaccharide portion
and a hydrophobic domain known as lipid a, which is
responsible for its biological activity. stimulation of
macrophages with lps results in the production of
various cytokines such as  xxxg2296xxx , il-1, il-6, il-10,
macrophage inflammatory protein-1a/b (mip-1a/b),
and inflammatory effector substances such as prostanoids, leukotrienes, and  xxxd2738xxx . cd14 is a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (gpi) anchored cell surface
glycoprotein that functions as a binding receptor for
lps. when lps is present in the blood stream, it is
immediately captured by lipopolysaccharide-binding
protein (lbp), which is one of the acute phase proteins
produced in the liver. in cd14-negative cells such as
endothelial cells and fibroblasts, the soluble form of
cd14 present in serum can functionally replace membrane-bound cd14. occupation of the lps/lbp/cd14
ternary complex on the cell surface triggers activation of
several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(map kinase) family, and the transcriptional factor nfkb. although lps is bound primarily by lbp and
cd14, the fact that cd14 lacks a transmembrane
domain suggests the existence of an additional coreceptor that initiates signal transduction. indeed, lps-

mediated cellular activation does occur in cd14-deficient mice.
c3h/hej is a mutant mouse strain hyporesponsive to
lps. positional cloning of the lps locus demonstrated
that c3h/hej mice harbor a missense point mutation
within the cytoplasmic portion of tlr4 that results in
the substitution of histidine for a proline that is highly
conserved among tlr family members [7,8]. the
c57bl/sccr and c57bl/scn strains lack tlr4
mrna expression altogether due to a chromosomal
deletion of the gene. mice deficient in the tlr4 gene
were also generated by gene disruption techniques [9].
macrophages and b cells from these tlr4 knockout
(ko) mice were hyporesponsive to lps to a similar
extent to c3h/hej mice. furthermore, over-expression
of wild-type tlr4 but not c3/hej tlr4 activated nfkb, confirming that tlr4 is required for lps signaling
[9].
1.1.2. tlr2
tlr2 has also been shown to be involved in lpsmediated signaling. of the human tlr 1 /5, only overexpression of human tlr2 solely conferred lps
responsiveness on the human embryonic kidney cell
line 293 [10,11]. in addition, evidence suggested that
human tlr2 interacts with cd14 to form an lps
receptor complex [12]. lps treatment leads to the
oligomerization of this receptor and to the subsequent
recruitment of irak. however, results from tlr4
mutant mice demonstrated more definitely that lps
specifically activates via the tlr4 receptor. although
transfection of cell lines with human tlr4 alone did
not confer the ability to respond to lps, dose-dependent lps responsiveness occurred following cotransfection of the novel molecule, md2, which physically
associates with tlr4 on the cell surface [13]. finally,
tlr2 ko mice as well as chinese hamster ovary cells
with a defective tlr2 gene exhibit normal lps
responsiveness [14,15]. thus, the initial proposal that
tlr2 is the lps receptor is strongly challenged by these
subsequently published data. indeed repurification of
commercially available lps preparations showed that

neither human nor murine tlr2 play a role in lps
signaling [16]. however, some lpss (from leprospira
interrogans and porphyromonas gingivalis ) that are
structurally different from those from enterobacteria
have been shown to activate cells through tlr2 [17,18].
gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus
do not produce lps but trigger a toxic shock syndrome
similar to that induced by lps. the major immunostimulatory components are peptidoglycan (pgn), lipoteichoic acid (lta) and lipoproteins. several studies
with tlr2-expressing cell lines and tlr2 ko mice
showed that pgn and lipoproteins are recognized by
tlr2 [19,20]. in fact, tlr2 ko mice are highly
susceptible to staphylococcus aureus infection [21]. it
has also been shown that tlr2 is involved
in the responses to lipoproteins/lipopeptides from mycobacterium tuberculosis [22], gram-negative bacteria
[23], borrelia burgdoreri [24], and mycoplasma fermentans [25], gpi anchors from trypanosoma cruzi [26],
lipoarabinomannan from mycobacterium tuberculosis
[27,28] and zymosan, a component of yeast cell wall
[29].
1.1.3. tlr2/6 and tlr2/1 heterodimers
the possibility that tlr2 ligands are recognized by
heterodimers between tlr2 and other tlr was first
indicated by aderem et al. [30]. both dominant negative
(dn)-tlr2 or dn-tlr6 mutants completely inhibited
 xxxg2296xxx  production elicited by pgn or zymosan. in
contrast, tlr2 recognizes bacterial lipopeptide without
tlr6. they also showed that dimerization of the
cytoplasmic domain of tlr2 does not induce  xxxg2296xxx 
production in macrophages, whereas the cytoplasmic
domain of tlr2 can form functional pairs with tlr6,
leading to cytokine production. these results suggested
that tlr2/6 heterodimers recognize pgn and zymosan
whereas bacterial lipoprotein is recognized by a heterodimer between tlr2 and another, as yet unidentified
tlr. we have generated tlr6 ko mice and examined
the response to pgn, zymosan, and lipoproteins [20]. in
contrast with the aderem group’s findings, the response
to pgn was not impaired, indicating that tlr6 does

not participate in pgn recognition. nevertheless,
tlr6-deficient macrophages did not produce any
detectable levels of inflammatory cytokines in response
to synthetic mycoplasmal lipopeptide, malp-2 as is the
case for tlr2-deficient macrophages. the requirement
for both tlr2 and tlr6 in malp-2 recognition was
further confirmed by reconstitution experiments in
which tlr2 or tlr6 expression vectors were transfected into tlr2///tlr6/// deficient embryonic
fibroblasts and then il-6 production was measured.
only when both expression vectors were transfected, the
mutant mef restored the ability to respond to malp2. on the other hand, in the case of synthetic bacterial
lipopeptide, pam3csk4, tlr6-deficient macrophages
responded normally to this. fig. 1 shows structural
differences between malp-2 and pam3csk4. all
membrane-anchored lipoproteins contain a lipolyated
amino-terminal residue. the immunostimulatory activity of lipoproteins is attributed to the lipid portion. the
lipolylation of the amino-terminal cysteinyl residue by a
diacylglyceryl moiety via a thioether bond is a feature
common to all known bacterial membrane lipoproteins
[31]. some lipoproteins undergo further acylation at the
cysteinyl residue via an amide bond. for triacylated
lipoproteins such as the braun’s lipoprotein in escherichia coli , the maturation pathway comprises three
steps, that is, diacylglyceryl modification of the prolipoprotein by diacylglyceryl transferase, cleavage of the
leader peptide by signal peptidase ii, and n-acylation of
the amino-terminal diacylglyceryl cysteinyl residue.
pam3csk4 contains triacylated cysteinyl residue at
the n-terminus, whereas the cysteinyl residue in malp-

2 is only diacylated. therefore, it was expected that this
difference might explain the tlr6 requirement in
malp-2 recognition. in fact, the replacement of the
lipid portion of malp-2 with that of pam3csk4
activated tlr6-deficient macrophages, demonstrates
that tlr6 discriminates between the subtle differences
in the lipid portion of these lipopeptides.
we have recently generated tlr1 ko mice and
examined the response to a variety of bacterial components [32]. tlr1 ko mice responded to pgn, lps and
mycoplasmal lipopeptide to the same extent as wild-type
mice. nevertheless, tlr1-deficient macrophages
showed partial impairment of the response to mycoplasmal 19 kd lipoprotein and bacterial lipopeptide,
pam3csk4. furthermore, the response to n-pam-slau2csk4 was more profoundly impaired in tlr1deficient cells, indicating that tlr1 is involved in the
recognition of lipoproteins and the configuration of the
lipid moiety of lipoproteins is critical for the tlr1
requirement.
as shown in fig. 2, mycoplasmal lipopeptide (diacylated form) is recognized by a heterodimer between
tlr2 and tlr6 whereas bacterial lipopeptides
pam3csk4 and n-pam-s-lau2csk4 (triacylated
forms) are preferentially recognized by a heterodimer
between tlr2 and tlr1. the responses to zymosan
and trypanosoma cruzi gpi are also recognized by a
tlr2/tlr6 heterodimer (our unpublished data). it is
possible that a tlr other than tlr1 and tlr6 pairs
with tlr2 to recognize pgn, or tlr2 alone may
suffice to recognize it.

1.1.4.  xxxg2293xxx 
cpg dna also stimulates immune cells [33 /35].
cpg dna is largely equivalent to bacterial dna.
unmethylated cpg-dinucleotide-containing sequences
(cpg odns) are found much more frequently in
bacterial genomes than in vertebrate genomes, whereas
the frequency of cpg dinucleotides are suppressed and
usually methylated. methylated cpg odns lack immunostimulatory activities. bacterial dna and synthetic odn containing unmethylated cpg-dinucleotide
(cpg dna) stimulate b cell proliferation and activate
macrophages and dcs. genomic dna from viruses,
yeast and insects stimulate mammalian immune cells as
well. cpg dna is known to be an excellent immune
adjuvant in various murine disease models and to drive
th1 immune responses. cpg dna activates the intracytoplasmic signaling molecules such as irak,
traf6,  xxxg1559xxx  and map kinase like other pathogenderived immunostimulatory components. however, unlike lps, which can activate tlr4 at the cell surface,
uptake of cpg dna as well as endosomal maturation
is likely to be required for its immunostimulatory
activity. indeed, chloroquine and related compounds
that prevent acidification of endosome are shown to
inhibit cpg dna response [36]. the immunostimulatory activity of bacterial dna was initially reported by
tokunaga et al. who showed that dna purified from
bacilli calmette-guerin inhibited the growth of various
syngeneic animal tumors, augmented nk cell activity
and induced ifna/b and ifn-g from mouse spleen cells
and human pbl [37]. krieg et al. subsequently reported
that bacterial dna as well as synthetic odn containing
a central cpg induces b cell proliferation [38]. they
conducted extensive studies to define the dna sequences with immunostimulatory activities. the most
immunostimulatory motif usually has the structure of
5?-purine-purine-cpg-pyrimidine-pyrimidine-3?.
inversion to gpc or methylation completely abrogates its stimulatory potential, and the regions adjacent
to the cpg dinucleotide also affect the immunostimulatory activity. the optimal sequence differs significantly between human and mouse. mouse cells respond
maximally to gacgtt, while for humans the optimal
sequence is gtcgtt. recent studies indicate that
immunostimulatory dnas may exert different immune
responses depending on the nucleotide sequence and
backbone. there are two major types of immunostimulatory cpg dnas [39]. one type has an entirely
phosphorothioate backbone with cpg dinucleotides.
this cpg dna stimulates b cell proliferation and
induces production of il-6 and il-12 by monocytes.
the other type contains phosphorothioate g-rich sequences at the ends and a phosphodiester palindromic
sequences with a cpg dinucleotide in the middle. this
cpg dna preferentially stimulates ifn-g production
by nk cells.

89

we have generated  xxxg2293xxx  ko mice, and found that
the response to cpg dna is mediated by  xxxg2293xxx  [40].
 xxxg2293xxx -deficient mice did not show any inflammatory
cytokine production of macrophages, proliferation of b
cells, or maturation of dcs in response to unmethylated
cpg dna. cpg dna-induced activation of several
signaling molecules such as  xxxg1559xxx , jnk, and irak
was severely impaired in  xxxg2293xxx -deficient mice. these
results demonstrate that cellular activation in response
to cpg dna is mediated by  xxxg2293xxx . in spite of the
existence of various types of cpg dna with different
biological effects,  xxxg2293xxx  ko mice were unresponsive to
all cpg dna we used, demonstrating that  xxxg2293xxx  is
essential for the response to a variety of cpg dna.
recent complementation experiment using cpg-unresponsive 293 cells transfected with human or mouse
 xxxg2293xxx  unambiguously demonstrated that human  xxxg2293xxx 
recognizes the human cpg motif most efficiently,
whereas mouse  xxxg2293xxx  has a high preference for the
mouse cpg motif, suggesting direct interaction of the
 xxxg2293xxx  receptor with its cpg dna ligand [41].
at the same time as we published the  xxxg2293xxx  paper, a
report showed that cpg dna activates dna protein
kinase (dna-pk), which phosphorylates ikb-kinases,
leading to the activation of  xxxg1559xxx , which further leads
to the production of cytokines [42]. furthermore, it was
shown that dna-pk is also essential for the response to
cpg dna based on the lack of the response to cpg
dna in dna-pk ko mice. therefore, we reevaluated
the role of dna-pk in cpg dna responsiveness with
dna-pk ko mice that were kindly provided by dr
fred alt. dna-pk-ko dcs showed upregulation of
costimulatory molecules and cytokine production in
response to cpg dna, indicating that dna-pk is
not essential for the response to cpg dna (our
unpublished data).
1.1.5. tlr5
flagellin is a 55-kda monomer obtained from bacterial flagella, a polymeric rod-like appendage extending
from the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria
that propels the organism through its aqueous environment. flagellin is also a potent proinflammatory factor.
flagellated bacteria, purified flagellin, and medium
conditioned by flagellated bacteria all induce  xxxg1559xxx 
activation and inos expression in transformed human
epithelial cells and murine macrophages. these actions
of flagellin have been shown to be mediated through
tlr5 [43]. tlr5-stimulating activity was purified from
l. monocytogenes culture supernatants and identified as
flagellin by tandem mass spectrometry. expression of l.
monocytogenes flagellin in non-flagellated e. coli conferred on the bacterium the ability to activate tlr5,
while deletion of the flagellin genes from s. typhimurium
abrogated tlr5-stimulating activity. tlr5 is expressed on the basolateral, but not apical, surface of

intestinal epithelia [44]. therefore, flagellin activates
proinflammatory gene expression in the epithelia only if
it crosses intestinal epithelia and contacts their basolateral membranes, which explains why commensal microbes can secrete flagellin into the intestinal lumen yet
not induce inflammation. flagellin acts as a  xxxg80xxx  in
plants as well. fls2, the gene affected in several
independent mutants exhibiting flagellin insensitivity,
encodes a lrr  xxxg1608xxx -like kinase
with similarities to tlrs in mammals [45]. evidence
indicates that the lrr domain of fls physically
interacts with flagellin [46]. there is no significant
homology between the lrr domains of tlr5 and
fls2.
1.1.6.  xxxg2289xxx 
viral replication within infected cells results in generation of dsrna which can stimulate immune cells. it
is well known that dsrna binds and activates the
dsrna activated protein kinase, pkr, initiating downstream signaling that inhibits viral replication and
upregulation of inflammatory cytokine production.
however, cells derived from pkr ko mice still respond
to the viral rna mimic, poyinosine-polycytidylic acid,
poly(i:c), suggesting the existence of another receptor,
which recognizes dsrna. recently,  xxxg2289xxx  ko mice
have been generated and showed reduced responses to
poly(i:c), suggesting that  xxxg2289xxx  is involved in recognition of dsrna [47]. this may indicate the role of  xxxg2289xxx 
in viral recognition.
1.1.7.  xxxg2291xxx 
 xxxd2339xxx  ( xxxd2339xxx ,  xxxd2339xxx ,  xxxd2339xxx ) and r-848
(resiquimod, s-28463) are low molecular weight compounds of the imidazoquinoline family that have potent
antiviral and antitumor properties in animal models
[48](fig. 3).  xxxd2339xxx ’s antiviral activity was first
discovered in guinea-pigs infected with herpes simplex
virus.  xxxd2339xxx  is also shown to be effective against
arbovirus and cytomegalovirus. the activity of  xxxd2339xxx  is mediated predominantly through the induction
of cytokines including ifn-a and il-12. topical

 xxxd2339xxx  therapy is now approved for the treatment
of external genital and perianal warts caused by
papilloma virus infection. r-848 is a more potent
analogue of  xxxd2339xxx , and trials are under way to
assess its use in treatment of genital herpes and hepatitis
c virus.
we found that the response to these imidazoquinolines is completely abolished in  xxxg1489xxx  ko mice,
indicating the involvement of tlrs in the response to
imidazoquinolines. further studies showed that  xxxg2291xxx  is
essential for the response to imidazoquinolines [49].
peritoneal macrophages from wild-type mice produced
 xxxg2296xxx , il-6 and il-12 in response to  xxxd2339xxx  or r848, whereas  xxxg2291xxx  ko macrophages produced no
detectable amounts of these cytokines in response to
either compound. wild-type splenocytes proliferated in
response to  xxxd2339xxx  or r-848 in a dose-dependent
manner. in contrast,  xxxg2291xxx  ko splenocytes did not
proliferate in response to either  xxxd2339xxx  or r-848.
furthermore,  xxxg2291xxx -deficient bone marrow-derived
dcs did not show upregulation of the costimulatory
molecules, cd40,  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  in response to r848. activation of intracytoplasmic molecules involved
in tlr signaling such as irak,  xxxg1559xxx  and jnk was
completely abolished in  xxxg2291xxx  ko macrophages. intraperitoneal injection of wild-type mice with r-848
induced increased serum concentrations of ifn-a,
 xxxg2296xxx  and il-12. in contrast, increase in serum levels
of these cytokine was not observed in  xxxg2291xxx  ko mice.
recently it has been shown that two other  xxxd371xxx , loxoribine and bropirimine are also  xxxg2291xxx 
ligands (fig. 3) (our unpublished data). loxoribine (7allyl-8-oxoguanosine) enhances nk cell activity, b
lymphocyte proliferation, and induces production of
interferons and cytokines [50]. bropirimine (2-amin-5bromo-6-phenyl-4(3)-pyrimidinone, abpp) is an orally
active immunomodulator that increases endogenous
ifn-a and other cytokines, and is used clinically against
carcinoma of the bladder [51]. further studies will be
needed to disclose the structure-activity relationship of
 xxxg2291xxx  and its ligands.

1.2.  xxxg1489xxx -dependent and independent pathways in
lps signaling
triggering of  xxxg1171xxx  or tlr recruits irak to the
receptor complex via adaptor  xxxg1489xxx , then traf6 is
activated, which finally results in activation of  xxxg1559xxx 
and map kinases (fig. 4).  xxxg1489xxx -deficient mice were
generated and found to be completely unresponsive to
il-1 as well as il-18, an il-1-related cytokine, demonstrating that  xxxg1489xxx  is a critical component in the
signaling cascades mediated by  xxxg1171xxx  and il-18r.
furthermore,  xxxg1489xxx  ko mice did not respond to
lps and other immunostimulatory bacterial components including pgn, lipoproteins, cpg dna, and
imidazoquinolines, demonstrating essential roles of
 xxxg1489xxx  in the response to all pathogen-derived immunostimulatory molecules.
however there is a difference in the signaling pathways triggered by lps and by these latter stimuli.
mycoplasmal lipopeptide-dependent activation of nfkb and map kinases, which is mediated by tlr2, is
completely abolished in tlr2 ko or  xxxg1489xxx  ko
macrophages [25]. however, lps activation of map

kinases and  xxxg1559xxx  remains intact in  xxxg1489xxx  ko
macrophages, although activation was delayed compared with wild-type mice [52]. this indicates that the
lps response may be mediated by both myd88dependent and -independent pathways, each of which
leads to the activation of map kinases and  xxxg1559xxx .
nevertheless, the  xxxg1489xxx -dependent pathway is essential for the inflammatory response mediated by lps.
further studies demonstrated that the  xxxg1489xxx -independent pathway is involved in irf-3 activation, and
induction of type i ifn and ifn inducible genes
including  xxxg559xxx  [53]. consistent with the lack of
 xxxg1489xxx -independent pathway in tlr2 signaling, wildtype macrophages do not activate irf-3 or induce  xxxg559xxx 
mrna in response to mycoplasmal lipopeptide. the
 xxxg1489xxx -independent pathway has also been shown to
regulate lps-mediated maturation of dcs [54]. recently, a novel protein containing a tir domain and
designated tirap/mal has been identified [55,56].
tirap/mal over-expression led to activation of nfkb in 293 cells and is associated with  xxxg2290xxx  but not
other tlr members. it is most likely that tirap/mal
participates in  xxxg1489xxx -independent  xxxg1559xxx  activation.

a further interesting point is whether tirap is also
involved in  xxxg1489xxx -independent activation of irf-3
and subsequent induction of ifn-b and ifn-inducible
genes.

2. dendritic cells and tlrs
dcs reside in most tissues and organs in the
‘immature state’, and play a sentinel role in detecting
invading pathogens [57]. the immature dcs are characterized by high endocytotic capacity, low expression
of mhc and costimulatory molecules on their surface.
the function of dcs is not primarily to destroy
pathogens but to present pathogen-associated antigens
to t cells, leading to activation of acquired immunity.
upon encountering a pathogen, immature dcs can be

activated and undergo maturation, which accompanies
production of cytokines and chemokines, surface induction of costimulatory molecules, and a low endocytotic
capacity. at the same time, dcs digest the pathogen
proteins into small peptides and express them on their
surface together with mhc complexes, and move from
the infected site to regional lymph nodes, where they
promote naı̈ve t cells towards a th1 or th2 phenotype.
such dc activation is performed through the interaction of tlrs and pathogen-derived immunostimulatory
molecules [58]. thus, tlrs play a crucial role in
induction of acquired immunity as well as innate
immunity. particularly, it is noteworthy that myd88deficient mice developed a strong th2 response when
these mice were immunized with ovalbumin plus complete freund adjuvant, indicating that tlr-mediated
recognition primarily induces a th1 response [59]. in

s. akira, h. hemmi / immunology letters 85 (2003) 85 /95

fact alum, an adjuvant now used for human vaccination
that does not activate tlrs, induces th2-skewed
responses.

3. myeloid dc and plasmatoid dc
there are two dc subsets identified in human [60].
one is  xxxg1208xxx  myeloid dendritic cell (mdc) and the
other  xxxg1208xxx  plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pdc). these
two subsets differ in tlr expression as well as cytokine
production profile; mdc express tlr4 but not  xxxg2293xxx ,
and thereby respond to lps but not cpg dna. on the
other hand, pdc express  xxxg2293xxx  but not tlr4 and
respond to cpg dna. a characteristic of pdc is the
production of a large amount of type i ifns in response
to viral infection. we studied the effect of  xxxg2291xxx  ligands
on these two dc subsets [61]. first we examined the
expression of  xxxg2291xxx  in these two subsets. as previously
shown, mdc express tlr4 but not  xxxg2293xxx  whereas
pdc express  xxxg2293xxx  but not tlr4, interestingly,  xxxg2291xxx 
mrna was expressed in both mdc and pdc (fig. 5a).
most cells died within 24 h in the absence of stimuli.
addition of  xxxd2339xxx  or r-848 enhanced the survival
of both mdc and pdc, indicating that  xxxg2291xxx  expression is functional in both subsets. we next examined
cytokine production from these subsets in response to
 xxxg2291xxx  ligands. mdc produced il-12 in response to
 xxxd2339xxx  or r-848, but not ifn-a. in contrast, pdc
produced ifn-a in response to each  xxxg2291xxx  ligand, but
did not produce il-12. the effect of  xxxg2291xxx  ligandtreated dc on t cell helper response was also studied.
mdc or pdc was preincubated with r-848 for 24 h,
and then cocultured with allogeneic naı̈ve cd4 t cells.
r-848-treated mdc strongly induced th1 development
and this effect was significantly reduced by addition of
anti-il-12 antibody, but not by anti-ifna/b antibody.
r-848-treated pdc also developed ifn-g producing
cells. this th1 induction was significantly reduced by
anti-ifn antibody but not by anti-il-12 antibody.
these results indicate that both pdc and mdc induce
th1 development in response to  xxxg2291xxx  ligands through
distinct cytokine production (fig. 5b). although the
natural ligand for  xxxg2291xxx  remains unclear, the potent
ifn-a production from  xxxg2291xxx  ligand-treated pdc
indicates the possibility that mammalian immune cells
may recognize viral invasion through  xxxg2291xxx .

4. conclusion
evidence is now accumulating that the recognition
mechanism and subsequent signaling pathway are quite
different between insects and mammals. toll in insects is
not a receptor that recognizes bacteria itself, but is
activated by an endogenous ligand, spatzle, that is

93

generated as a result of a series of proteolytic processing
steps by extracellular serine proteases. recently, a
certain protein family has been demonstrated to participate in the direct recognition of pathogens [62 /65].
using a genetic screening, the gene semmelweiss (seml ),
which encodes a pgn-recognition protein named
pgrpsa, was found to be involved in resistance to
gram-positive bacterial infection. the antifungal response in seml mutant flies is intact, suggesting the
existence of a distinct pattern recognition receptor that
is involved in the recognition of fungus. regarding the
recognition of gram-negative bacteria another pgnrecognition protein termed pgrp-lc has been suggested. these results indicate that the recognition of
pamps occurs upstream of toll in drosophila . in
contrast, in the case of pathogen recognition by
mammals, several reports support the idea that tlrs
directly recognize corresponding ligands [66,67,41],
although direct evidence is still lacking. the urgent
need for future study is structural analysis of the leucinerich domain of each tlr as well as mutational analysis
for studying its functional interaction with ligands.
