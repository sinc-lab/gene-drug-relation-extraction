synergistic cytotoxic interaction in hormone-refractory
prostate cancer with the triple combination docetaxel–
 xxxd2029xxx  and 5-fluoro-50-deoxyuridine
jean-louis fischela, joseph ciccolinib, patricia formentoa, jean-marc ferreroa
and gérard milanoa
the current reference treatment of hormone-refractory
prostate cancer consists mainly of chemotherapy with
docetaxel. to improve the management of advanced
prostate cancer, one should examine the benefits of adding
other agents to docetaxel. we examined the growth
inhibitory effects of a triple combination, including the
anti- xxxg681xxx  receptor drug  xxxd2029xxx ,
docetaxel and 5-fluoro-50 -deoxyuridine (the main
intermediary metabolite of  xxxd425xxx ), on the human
prostate cancer cell lines  xxxg1682xxx  and du145, which are both
devoid of androgen receptors. marked synergistic cytotoxic
effects were observed with the application of the double
combination of  xxxd2029xxx –5-fluoro-50 -deoxyuridine for both
cell lines and to a lesser magnitude with the triple
combination. for  xxxg1682xxx  cells, all conditions resulted in
synergistic interactions. the combination between  xxxd2029xxx 
and docetaxel resulted in an approximately 50% reduction
in  xxxg2366xxx  activity (the molecular target of
 xxxd2117xxx  monophosphate, the active
 xxxd425xxx  anabolite) with an higher impact observed
with du145 cells than with  xxxg1682xxx  cells. neither  xxxd2029xxx  nor
docetaxel alone displayed marked effects on thymidine
phosphorylase activity (the enzyme that governs at the

introduction
numerous studies are underway to assess the role of
chemotherapy for patients at various stages of prostate
cancer [1]. one of the current treatments of reference in
hormone-refractory prostate cancer consists of chemotherapy with docetaxel (taxotere) combined with
prednisone [2]. a recent controlled study by tannock and
coworkers [3] strengthened the importance of the use of
docetaxel in prostate cancer by showing that as compared
with patients treated by mitoxantrone, those receiving
docetaxel had a hazard ratio for death of 0.76 (p = 0.009).
the following steps of improvement in the management
of advanced prostate cancer should examine the benefits
of adding other agents to docetaxel. we recently observed
[4] that the combination docetaxel–5-fluoro-50 -deoxyuridine (50 dfur) resulted in a sequence-dependent
synergistic cytotoxic interaction on hormone-refractory
human prostate cancer, pointing to clinical application of
a docetaxel– xxxd425xxx  combination (50 dfur being
the main circulating anabolite of  xxxd425xxx ).

cellular level the final and crucial step in the activation
cascade of  xxxd425xxx ), in contrast to their combination
that resulted in a strong increase in thymidine
phosphorylase activity in  xxxg1682xxx  cells. these data may serve
as a rational basis for setting up clinical trials in advanced
prostate cancer combining  xxxg681xxx 
receptor-targeting agents like  xxxd2029xxx  together with
docetaxel and  xxxd425xxx . anti-cancer drugs

numerous molecular mechanisms are linked to the
transition to hormone-refractory prostate cancer [5]. the
involvement of the human  xxxg681xxx  receptor
(egfr) signaling family of proteins seems to be the most
important [6,7]. we previously observed a synergistic
cytotoxic interaction when combining egfr targeting with
50 dfur [8]. these supra-additive effects could be
explained by an upregulation of  xxxg2365xxx 
(tp) by the anti-egfr drug [8]. tp is the enzyme that
governs at the cellular level the final and crucial step in the
activation cascade of  xxxd425xxx  [9]. interestingly, other
authors have found that taxanes were able to upregulate the
tumor activity of tp and have shown a synergistic cytotoxic
activity when combining taxanes with  xxxd425xxx  [10,11].
this synergy was recently confirmed at the clinical level
giving a new standard in the management of advanced
breast cancer [12].
on the basis of the above considerations, it was judged as
interesting to examine a triple combination including the

clinically relevant anti-egfr drug  xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva)
together with docetaxel and 50 dfur on the human
prostate cancer cell lines  xxxg1682xxx  and du145, both of which
are devoid of androgen receptors. the sequence of drugs
tested in the present study was based on previous
experiments showing a sequence-dependent synergistic
cytotoxic interaction with docetaxel followed by 50 dfur
[4]. for this reason, in the present study, the molecular
factors examined so as to explain the observed drug
interactions were the key enzymes for 50 dfur ( xxxd425xxx ) activity: tp, thymidine synthase (ts) and
 xxxg652xxx  (dpd).

material and methods
chemicals

 xxxd2029xxx  (pure product) was kindly provided by roche
(basel switzerland). docetaxel was the clinical formulation and was provided by the pharmacy of our institution.
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium, penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine were purchased from whittaker
(verviers, belgium). fetal bovine serum was from
dutscher (brumath, france). 50 dfur, 3-(4-5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide
(mtt) and dimethylsulfoxide were purchased from
sigma (st quentin fallavier, france) and were of the
highest purity available.
cell lines

two human prostatic tumor-derived cell lines du145
(egfr content 250 000/cell) and  xxxg1682xxx  (egfr content
170 000/cell), both devoid of androgen receptors, were
used. cells were routinely cultured in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 2 mmol/l glutamine, 600 mg/l insulin,
500 mg/l transferrin, 50 000 units/penicillin and 80 mmol/l
streptomycin in a fully humidified incubator (sanyo,
osaka, japan) at 371c in an atmosphere containing 8%
co2.
drug exposure
cytotoxicity experiments

cells were seeded in microtitration plates (2000 cells per
well). forty-eight hours after cell seeding,  xxxd2029xxx 
(concentration range: 10 – 7 to 10 – 5 mol/l) and/or docetaxel (concentration range: 4  10 – 10 to 4  10 – 9 mol/l)
were added for 48 h. at the end of exposure to docetaxel
and/or  xxxd2029xxx , 50 dfur (concentration range: 10 – 6 to
10 – 3 mol/l) was added for 48 h. the mtt test was
performed at the end of exposure to 50 dfur. this fixed
sequence of treatment with  xxxd2029xxx –docetaxel and
50 dfur was dictated by our previous experience with
two-drug combinations [4,8].
 xxxg2366xxx  and  xxxg2365xxx 
measurement

cells were seeded in petri dishes (1.23  106 cells); 48 h
later,  xxxd2029xxx  (final concentration 4  10 – 6 mol/l) and/or

docetaxel (final concentration 1.7  10 – 9 mol/l) were
added for 48 h. cells were harvested at the end of
exposure to  xxxd2029xxx  and/or docetaxel and cell pellets
were frozen.
cytotoxicity measurement

growth inhibition was assessed 4 days after incubation
with the first drug ( xxxd2029xxx  and/or docetaxel) by the
mtt test [13], as described below. cells were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with mtt.
after 2 h of incubation, mtt was released and coloration
was revealed by the addition of 100 ml of dimethylsulfoxide. absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a
microplate reader (labsystems, helsinki, finland). the
results were expressed as the relative percentage of
absorbance compared with controls without drug. experimental conditions were tested in sextuplicate (six wells
of the 96-well plate per experimental condition) and
experiments were performed in quadruplicate at distant
intervals. the dose–effect curves were analyzed using
prism software (graphpad software, san diego, california, usa). the antiproliferative activity was expressed by
the ic50 value (concentration leading to 50% cell
survival).
combination index calculations

the cytotoxic effects obtained with the different drug
combinations ( xxxd2029xxx –docetaxel,  xxxd2029xxx –50 dfur,
docetaxel–50 dfur and  xxxd2029xxx –docetaxel–50 dfur)
were analyzed according to the chou and talalay [14]
method using the calcusyn software (biosoft, cambridge,
uk) by means of an automatically computed combination
index (ci). in case of three-drug combination, the
calcusyn program gives the ci for every experimental
point, but does not allow us to draw a regression line from
the calculated values.
synergism is indicated by ci below 0.8, additivity by ci
values between 0.8 and 1.2, and antagonism by ci above
1.2; slight synergistic and additive cytotoxic activities are
indicated by ci values of 0.8 and 1.2, respectively.
 xxxg2366xxx  activity assay

ts activity was measured according to the tritium-release
assay described by spears and gustavsson [15]. cytosol
(25 ml) was incubated with [3h]dump (1 mmol/l final
concentration)
and
5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
(0.62 mmol/l final concentration) in a total volume of
55 ml. after 0 (for blank subtraction), 10, 20 and 30 min of
incubation at 371c, the reaction was stopped on ice.
excess [3h]dump was removed by adding activated
charcoal (300 ml, 15%) containing 4% trichloroacetic acid
before a 5-min centrifugation at 14 000 g, at room
temperature. the 3h2o formed during the incubation
was then counted in the supernatant using a liquid
scintillation counter (1409 dsa; wallac, turku, finland).

docetaxel– xxxd2029xxx –50 dfur prostate cancer fischel et al. 809

the results were expressed as femtomoles of 3h2o
formed per minute per milligram of protein, on the basis
of the linear regression obtained from the incubation
times. the sensitivity limit was 10 fmol/min/mg protein.
interassay reproducibility was evaluated through repeated analysis of single-use aliquots of a pooled cytosol:
n = 5, mean = 1110 fmol/min/mg protein, sd = 78.59 fmol/
min/mg protein, coefficient of variation = 7.08%.
 xxxg2365xxx  activity assay

two distinct pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases are
present in normal and neoplastic cells: tp, for which the
major substrate is thymidine, and  xxxg2391xxx ,
which is responsible for the reversible catalysis of uridine
to uracil. as tp is mainly responsible for the catalysis of
50 -dfur into 5-fluorouracil ( xxxd2134xxx ), tp activity was
measured in the analyzed samples. specific inhibitors
for tp (tp inhibitor from taiho, japan) and uridine
phosphorylase [phenylselenerylacycouridine (psau)]
were applied in order to determine the specific activity
of tp in the reaction mixture. psau was kindly provided
by dr m. el kouni (university of alabama at birmingham).
the analytical method used for the determination of tp
activity was derived from kubota et al. [16]. cultured cells
(107) were homogenized in 500 ml lysis buffer [50 mmol/l
tris–hcl (ph 6.8), 1% triton x-100, 2 mmol/l 4-(2aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.02%  xxxd26xxx ]. the samples were centrifuged at 105 000 g
for 30 min at 41c. protein concentrations were determined using the method of bradford. supernatants
(0.8 mg protein/ml) were incubated for 4 h at 371c with
10 mmol/l 50 -dfur and 180 mmol/l potassium phosphate
(ph 7.4) ± 100 mmol/l of tp inhibitor or psau. the
reaction was stopped by the addition of 360 ml of ice-cold
methanol to the 120 ml reaction mixture. after removal of
the precipitate by centrifugation, an aliquot (dilution of
1/5) of the reaction mixture was applied to the hplc
column (licrospher 100-rp 18; agilent technologies,
santa clara, california, usa). the elution buffer
consisted of 50 mmol/l phosphate buffer (ph 6.8)
containing 10% methanol. the amount of  xxxd2134xxx  produced
was monitored by ultraviolet absorbance (262 nm). tp
activity was expressed as nanomoles of  xxxd2134xxx  converted per
milligram of protein per hour.
statistical analysis

group comparisons were made according to the mann
and whitney test (instat; graphpad).

results
figure 1 shows the effects on cell growth of drugs given
alone or in combination. a specific representation was
adopted so as to allow visualization of the relative
contribution of each drug to the common effect in the

associations. in this way, it appears that for  xxxg1682xxx  cells
(fig. 1a) the cytotoxic effect resulting from the triple
combination exceeds that observed with each double
combination. the advantage of the triple combination
was, however, less apparent on du145 cells, in which
docetaxel does not add much more in cytotoxicity to that
already obtained with the  xxxd2029xxx –50 dfur combination
(fig. 1b). it is noteworthy that auc50 (ic50  96 h) for
docetaxel calculated from our results (1.5 10 – 6 mol h/l)
compares well with published pharmacokinetic data
(5  10 – 6 mol  h/l) [17,18] and the  xxxd2029xxx  concentration (4.65  10 – 6 mol/l) matches well with the reported
concentration at the steady state (5  10 – 6 mol/l) in
treated patients [19]. two characteristic ci graphs
are depicted in fig. 2(a and b) for the triple combinations
on each tested cell line. the whole isobolographic
analysis of the combinations according to the chou
and talalay procedure is summarized in fig. 3. from
these data, it appears that strong synergistic cytotoxic
effects were observed with the application of the
double-combination  xxxd2029xxx –50 dfur for both cell lines
and to a lesser degree with the triple combination.
for  xxxg1682xxx  cells, all conditions resulted in synergistic
interactions.
intracellular molecular factors were examined. the
combination between  xxxd2029xxx  and docetaxel resulted
in an approximately 50% reduction in ts activity
(p = 0.0189), with a higher impact observed in du145
cells than in  xxxg1682xxx  cells (fig. 4). neither  xxxd2029xxx  nor
docetaxel alone displayed marked effects on tp activity,
in contrast to their combination resulting in a strong
increase in tp activity noted with  xxxg1682xxx  cells (fig. 5,
p = 0.037).

discussion
the introduction of docetaxel into the clinic has opened
a new era of improvement in the management of
advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer [3,20,21].
febbo and coworkers [22] have recently reported on
neoadjuvant use of docetaxel before medical prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients with high-risk localized
lesions. they observed that treatment was well tolerated,
and often resulted in a  xxxg1281xxx  decline
of more than 50% and in significant tumor volume
diminution [22]. as recently underlined by engels et al.
[21], current research into docetaxel-based chemotherapy should include drug combinations so as to improve
outcome with an acceptable feasibility. cases of hormonerefractory prostate cancer responding to  xxxd425xxx 
have been reported [23]. spicer and coworkers [24]
recently published the results of a phase ii trial using
 xxxd425xxx  in advanced prostate cancer. the authors
concluded that  xxxd425xxx  as a single drug had limited
antitumor activity, but appeared to modulate tumor
biology ( xxxg1281xxx  decrease) and they

 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, gefitinib, however, gave relatively disappointing clinical results as a single therapy
[28]. this background stimulated the present experimental study aimed at examining the cytotoxic effect
resulting from the triple combination docetaxel– xxxd2029xxx 
and 50 dfur (key anabolite of  xxxd425xxx ) on two
representative hormone-refractory human prostate cancer
cell lines  xxxg1682xxx  and du145. final cytotoxic effects
combined with an isobolographic analysis indicated a
supra-additive interaction when associating the three
drugs as shown in  xxxg1682xxx  cells with the fixed sequence
(docetaxel and  xxxd2029xxx  before 50 dfur). previous
studies, performed by our laboratory [4,8], pointed out
that egfr targeting with a  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor or
with docetaxel was able to develop synergistic cytotoxic
effects with 50 dfur and to impact on key enzymes of
the fluoropyrimidine pathway. it was thus observed that
the use of an egfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor induced a
marked decrease in ts activity and an increase in tp
activity [8]. docetaxel was not found to notably modify
tp activity, but was able to decrease ts activity [4]. the
present study indicates that the synergistic cytotoxicity

times for each cell line.

resulting from the triple-drug combinations could be
attributed, at least in part, to a favorable combinatory
effect on either ts activity or tp activity (figs 4 and 5).
thus, a more than 50% reduction in ts activity than in
the control was observed following the application of
tandem  xxxd2029xxx –docetaxel in du145 cells (fig. 4). ts
activity has been shown to be a cellular characteristic
associated with relative resistance to fluoropyrimidines

including 5 dfur [29,30]. consequently, lowering ts
activity by administration of both drugs may be a factor
contributing to the slight supra-additive cytotoxic effects
of the triple-drug combination observed in du145 cells.
of note, tp activity was increased more than 2-fold in
 xxxg1682xxx  cells in the presence of the  xxxd2029xxx –docetaxel
combination (fig. 5). an elevation in tp activity may
permit more  xxxd2134xxx  to be intracellularly delivered from its
prodrug 50 dfur [9]. this observation is fully consistent
with previously published reports showing that higher
levels of tp in the target cells are related to an increase in
the cytotoxic effect of  xxxd425xxx , 50 dfur and  xxxd2134xxx 
[31–33]. previous data have shown that dpd expression
can modulate the cytotoxic activity of 50 dfur [34].
dpd activity was low and at the limit of detection in the
tumor cell lines presently investigated (unshown data).
the three-drug sequence presently investigated was
logically in line with our previous experiments with
two-drug combinations [4,8]. to test other sequences
with the presently investigated drugs was outside the
scope of the study. the present data describe an original
combination between docetaxel– xxxd2029xxx  and 50 dfur
that can result in supra-additive cytotoxic effects on
hormone-refractory human prostate cancer cell lines. the
impact on cellular determinants of xeloda activity has
been examined and may provide at least a part of the
explanation of the mechanistics for the observed effects
on cell survival. these data may serve as a rational basis
for setting up clinical trials in advanced prostate cancer
combining egfr-targeting agents like  xxxd2029xxx  with
docetaxel and  xxxd425xxx . this approach has the
clinical advantage of potential synergistic antitumor
effects and the benefit of the presence of two oral
drugs ( xxxd2029xxx  and  xxxd425xxx ) in this three-drug
combination.
