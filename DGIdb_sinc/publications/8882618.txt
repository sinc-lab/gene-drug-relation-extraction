1 the 2,3-benzodiazepines gyki 52466, gyki 53405 and gyki 53655 antagonized ampa-induced
currents in cultured superior colliculus neurones in a non use-dependent manner (steady state ic50s:
gyki 52466 9.8+0.6 /m; gyki 53405 3.1 +0.6 gm; gyki 53655 0.8+0.1 gm).
2 higher concentrations of all three antagonists slowed the onset kinetics and quickened the offset
kinetics of ampa-induced currents indicative of an allosteric interaction with the ampa recognition
site.
3  xxxd1783xxx  (3- 300 gm) dramatically slowed desensitization of ampa-induced currents and
potentiated steady state currents (ec50 10.0 + 2.5 gtm) to a much greater degree than peak currents. both
ton and toff were also increased by  xxxd1783xxx  in a concentration-dependent manner (ec5o: ton
42.1 +4.5 gm; toff 31.6+6.6 mm).
4  xxxd1783xxx  (10-100 gm) shifted the concentration-response curves of the 2,3-benzodiazepines to
the right. for example, with 10 gm  xxxd1783xxx  the ic50s of gyki 52466 and gyki 53405 on steadystate ampa-induced currents were 57.9+9.5 and 41.6+1.5 gm, respectively.
5 gyki 53405 and gyki 52466 concentration-dependently reversed the effects of  xxxd1783xxx 
(100 gm) on offset kinetics (gyki 53405 ic50 16.6+4.2 em). however, the 2,3-benzodiazepines were
unable to reintroduce desensitization in the presence of  xxxd1783xxx  and even concentrationdependently slowed the onset kinetics of ampa responses further (gyki 53405 ecm 8.0+2.8 gm).
6 gyki 52466 decreased the peak amplitude of hippocampal area cal  xxxg981xxx -mediated
excitatory postsynaptic currents (e.p.s.cs) (ic50 10.8+0.8 mm) with no apparent effect on response
kinetics.  xxxd1783xxx  prolonged the decay time constant of  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs (ec50
35.7+6.5 gm) with less pronounced effects in slowing e.p.s.c. onset kinetics and increasing e.p.s.c.

amplitude.

7  xxxd1783xxx  (330 gm) shifted the concentration-response curve for the effects of gyki 52466 on
 xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.c. peak amplitude to the right (gyki 52466 ic50 26.9 + 9.4 em).
likewise, gyki 52466 (30-100 am)) shifted the concentration-response curve for the effects of
 xxxd1783xxx  on  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.c. decay time constants to the right.
8 in conclusion,  xxxd1783xxx  and the 2,3-benzodiazepines seem to bind to different sites on ampa
receptors but exert strong allosteric interactions with one another and with other domains such as the
agonist recognition site. the interactions of gyki 52466 and  xxxd1783xxx  on  xxxg981xxx -mediated
e.p.s.cs in area cal of hippocampal slices provide evidence that the decay time constant of these
synaptic events are not governed by desensitization.

introduction
glutamate is probably the major fast excitatory transmitter in
the mammalian central nervous system (see danysz et al.,
1995a for review). as such, there is a great deal of interest in
the biological actions of  xxxg981xxx  antagonists. most
research effort has concentrated on the n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda) subtype of ionotropic  xxxg981xxx  due to the
early availability of a variety of selective antagonists for this
receptor. the discovery of the potent and selective competitive
(s)-a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
(ampa) receptor antagonist, 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo-(f)quinoxaline (nbqx, sheardown et al., 1990;

1author for correspondence.

parsons et al., 1994), was therefore followed rapidly by extensive research on its actions in preclinical models. the newest
compounds to have gained considerable scientific attention are
2,3-benzodiazepines, such as 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8methyl-endioxyl-5h-2,3-benzodiazepine (gyki 52466), which
are relatively selective, non-competitive  xxxg981xxx  antagonists (quardouz & durand, 1991; donevan & rogawski,
1993; szabo & henley, 1993; tarnawa et al., 1993; donevan et
al., 1994; chizh et al., 1994; parsons et al., 1994; wilding &
huettner, 1995) and interfere with  xxxg981xxx -mediated
neurotransmission both in vitro and in vivo (tarnawa et al.,
1992; engberg et al., 1993; cumberbatch et al., 1994; quardouz & durand, 1994). like nbqx, the 2,3-benzodiazepines
also reduce  xxxg981xxx -mediated toxicity in vitro (may &
robison, 1993a) and in vivo (moncada et al., 1991; bisaga et

1210

g. rammes et al

al., 1993) and are effective in animal models of focal ischaemia
(smith & meldrum, 1992) and epilepsy (chapman et al., 1991,
1993; smith et al., 1991; yamaguchi et al., 1993; luscher &
honack, 1994; see rogawski, 1993 for review).
it is now clear that nbqx and the 2,3-benzodiazepines
have very different mechanisms of antagonistic action at
ampa receptors i.e. competitive and non-competitive respectively (donevan & rogawski, 1993; rogawski, 1993;
parsons et al., 1994). the 2,3-benzodiazepines seem to interact with a novel modulatory site and may therefore represent promising leads for the development of therapeutic
agents directed at ampa receptors due to their non-competitive nature and, as a consequence, different effects on
ampa response kinetics (rogwaski, 1993; parsons et al.,
1994). the other side of the coin is represented by positive
modulators of ampa receptors such as  xxxd181xxx  which
facilitate the actions of agonists at ampa receptors by decreasing desensitization, as such an effect has been proposed
to represent a promising approach for cognitive enhancement
(e.g. ito et al., 1990; staubli et al., 1992; lee & benfield,
1994; see danysz et al., 1995b for review). the diuretic agent
 xxxd1783xxx  (3-bicyclo-[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl-6-chloro-3,4-dihydro - 2h - 1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide- 1,1 -dioxide)
and derivatives thereof also inhibit desensitization of ampa
receptors and enhance long-term potentiation (ltp) in vitro
but are much more potent and effective in this regard (bertolino et al., 1993; livsey et al., 1993; partin et al., 1993;
1994a,b; patneau et al., 1993; yamada & tang, 1993; zivkovic et al., 1995).
in view of the contrasting modulatory effects of the 2,3benzodiazepines and  xxxd1783xxx  and its derivatives, it
seems pertinent to test whether these compounds are acting
in opposing ways at the same recognition site on ampa
receptors. this question has indeed been addressed previously in biochemical studies (barnes et al., 1994; desai et
al., 1994; 1995; hoyt et al., 1995) and electrophysiological
experiments on field potentials in cortical wedges (palmer &
lodge, 1993) and whole cell voltage-clamp recordings in
xenopus oocytes (sharp et al., 1994). however, the effects of
both classes of agent on receptor kinetics and synaptic
transmission cannot be addressed with such experiments (see
however, zorumski et al., 1993). the present study utilised
patch and concentration-clamp techniques to test for interactions between 2,3-benzodiazepines and  xxxd1783xxx  on
 xxxg981xxx -mediated currents in cultured superior colliculus neurones and  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs in
hippocampal slices. preliminary data have been presented in
abstract form and as a short paper (rammes et al., 1994a,
b).

methods
cell culture
superior colliculi were obtained from rat embryos (e20 to
e21) and were then transferred to calcium- and magnesiumfree hank's buffered salt solution (gibco) on ice. cells were
mechanically dissociated in 0.05% dnaase/0.3% ovomucoid
(sigma) following an 8 min pre-incubation with 0.66%
trypsin/0.1% dnaase (sigma). the dissociated cells were
then centrifuged at 18g for 10 min, re-suspended in minimum
essential medium (gibco) and plated at a density of 300,000
cells cm-2 onto poly-d, xxxd2793xxx  (sigma)/laminin (gibco) precoated plastic petri dishes (falcon). the cells were nourished with nahco3/hepes-buffered minimum essential
medium supplemented with 5% foetal calf serum and 5%
horse serum (gibco) and incubated at 370c with 5% co2
(95% humidity). the medium was exchanged completely
following inhibition of further glial mitosis with cytosine-fid-arabinofuranoside (20 gm sigma) after about 7 days in
vitro.

interactions of 2,3-benzodiazepines and  xxxd1783xxx 
concentration clamp recordings from cultured superior
colliculus neurones
whole cell recordings were made from cultured superior collicular neurones (10 to 14 days in vitro) at room temperature
(20-220c) with the aid of an epc-7 amplifier (list). most
recordings were made at a membrane potential of -70 mv.
patch clamp electrodes were pulled and polished with a horizontal puller (dmz) and had an internal tip diameter of about
1 gm and a tip resistance of 4 to 10 mc. cells were continuously superfused via one of eight channels of a custom
designed fast superfusion system with a common outflow. test
substances then were applied by rapidly switching channels.
complete exchange of the superfused solution was achieved
within 10 ms. the application of solutions and the synchronized on-line electronic acquisition of data were controlled by
the programme pclamp for ibm-pc. subsequently, autesp for ibm-pc (garching instruments, munich) was used
to analyse the data semi-automatically off-line. only results
from stable cells were accepted for inclusion in the final analysis i.e. following recovery of responses to ampa by at least
75% of their depression or enhancement by the agents tested.
the contents of the intracellular (electrode) solution were as
follows (mm): cscl 120, teaci 20, egta 10, mgcl2 1, cacl2
0.2, glucose 10, atp 2,  xxxd1773xxx  0.25. the extracellular
solutions had the following basic composition (mm): nacl
140, kcl 3, glucose 10, hepes 10, cacl2 0.2, sucrose 4.5,
glycine 0.001. neurones were pharmacologically isolated from
one another by the inclusion of tetrodotoxin (0.3 gm, ttx) to
block voltage-activated sodium currents. test substances were
added to this solution in concentrations detailed in results and
ph corrected, when necessary, to 7.35.

 xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs in area cal of
hippocampal slices
transverse hippocampal slices (400 gm thick) were obtained
from male wistar rats (140-200 g) which were anaesthetized
with ether before decapitation. the brain was removed rapidly
and slices were prepared in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (acsf) with a campden vibroslicer. all slices were placed
in a holding chamber for at least 90 min before being transferred to an immersion chamber for recordings. the flow rate
of the acsf through the recording chamber was 1.5 ml min-'.
the composition of the acsf was (mm): nacl 124, kcl 3,
nahco3 26, cacl2 2,  xxxd2534xxx  1, d-glucose 10, nah2po4 1.25.
at all stages, the acsf was bubbled with 95% 02/5% co2 and
had a final ph of 7.3.
patch clamp recordings were made from pyramidal-neurones in stratum pyramidale of area ca1. the mean input
resistance of the cells was 188 + 14 mq, (n = 40). glass electrodes (4.5-5 mil) contained (mm): csmeo4 130, hepes 5,
nacl 1, mgcl2 1, cacl2 0.035, egta 0.05 and qx-314 5-20.
currents were recorded with a switched voltage clamp amplifier (sec il, npl electronic; tamm/germany) using the
'blind' whole-cell recording technique (boulton et al., 1994).
switching frequencies of 20-25 khz (25% duty cycle) were
used. series resistance was monitored continuously and frequently compensated in bridge mode (for details see misgeld et
al., 1989; swandulla & misgeld, 1990). test stimuli (0.066 hz,
5-12 ma) were delivered via bipolar tungsten electrodes insulated to the tip (5 gim tip diameter) positioned in the schaffer
collateral-commissural pathway (sccp). to obtain pure
 xxxg981xxx -mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents
(e.p.s.cs), slices were perfused with d-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (d- xxxd1353xxx , 50 gm),  xxxd2947xxx  (50 .m) and cgp
35348 (200 tm) to block nmda, y- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)a and gabab receptors respectively. voltage-activated
sodium channels and k' -channels were blocked intracellularly
by qx-314 and cs'. all experiments were performed at room
temperature at a holding potential of -70 mv. e.p.s.cs were
amplified, filtered (667 hz) and digitized (2k hz) using a laboratory interface (itc-16 computer interface, instrutech

in slice experiments with  xxxd1783xxx , dmso (0.66%) was
present continuously in the acsf. moreover, similar results
were obtained in later experiments where  xxxd1783xxx  stock
solutions were made without dmso by adjusting ph to > 13.

2,3-benzodiazepines control inward currents to ampa
(100 pm) rose rapidly to a peak and then desensitized somewhat less rapidly to a steady-state of around 20% of this
maximum (figure 1, e.g. controls in experiments with gyki
53405: peak 894+38 pa, steady-state 204+ 19 pa,
t..=7.6±0.3 ms, t desensitization = 32.2+ 1.1 ms,
toff =174.1+7.9 ms, n = 58). the 2,3-benzodiazepines concentration-dependently antagonized both peak and steadystate components of current responses to ampa (100 jim) but
were somewhat more potent against steady-state currents at
concentrations less than their respective ic50s (figures 1 and
2). the most potent 2,3-benzodiazepine was gyki 53655
(steady-state ic5o = 0.8 + 0.1 gm), followed by gyki 53405
(steady-state icso = 3.1 + 0.6 gm) and then gyki 52466

figure 1 the 2,3-benzodiazepenes antagonize ampa-induced inward currents in cultured superior colliculus neurones. ampa
(100 mm) was applied for 700ms every l5s at -70mv. (a) the left and right panels show control and recovery responses
respectively. the middle three panels show equilibrium responses in the continuous presence of gyki 52466 10, 30 and 100mm
respectively. (b) the middle three panels show equilibrium responses in the continuous presence of gyki 53405 1, 3 and 10mm
respectively. (c d) pooled responses were quantified as peak and steady-state (plateau) currents after subtraction of any leak current
and plotted, after normalization to control, as means + s.e. mean against antagonist concentration (logarithmic). at least 6 cells were
tested at each concentration of antagonist. in (c); (@) gyki 52466 peak; (0) gyki 52466 plateau; (u) gyki 53655 peak; (o)
gyki 53655 plateau. in (d); (-) gyki 53405 peak; (0) gyki 53405 plateau. the 4 parameter logistic equation was used to fit
the data (solid curves) and to calculate the ic,,s for the 2,3-benzodiazepines. these values were as follows. gyki 52466: peak
ic50=12.4+1.1 um (hill coeff.=1.56+0.11); steady-state ic5o=9.76±0.55pm (hill coeff.=0.99+0.04). gyki 53655: peak
ic50=1.29+0.05m (hill coeff.=1.34+0.05); steady-state ic50=0.83+0.09mm (hill coeff.=1.02+0.08). gyki 53405: peak
ic50 = 6.68 + 1.22mm (hill coeff. = 1.24+0.15); steady-state ic50 =4.16+0.59mm (hill coeff. =0.93 +0.13). however, the inhibition
of steady state currents by gyki 53405 was better fit by a two site model (dotted curve) with the following parameters:
ic501 = 3.07 + 0.59 gm (capacity 87.4%); ic502 = 517 + 218 mm.

g. rammes et at

1212

(steady-state ic50 = 9.8 + 0.6 gm). ic50s against peak currents
were 1.3 + 0.1 gm, 6.7 + 1.2 mm and 12.4 + 1.1 gm respectively.
higher concentrations of all three antagonists slowed onset
kinetics and speeded offset kinetics, indicative of an allosteric
interaction with the ampa recognition site (e.g. with gyki
53405 (100 um) ton was 163.5 +27.7 ms and toff was
119.5 + 8.1 ms, n = 9, figure 5a). this effect probably accounts
for the steeper hill coefficients against peak currents (figure ic
and d). it was not possible to calculate accurately the potency
of the 2,3-benzodiazepines in mediating such effects due to the
small amplitude of currents recorded at higher concentrations
of antagonist. however, the ic50 of gyki 53405 on toff was
estimated to be about 40 gm. in contrast, none of the three
antagonists had any effect on desensitization kinetics at any
concentration where such an effect would have been detectable
(figures 1 and 5a).
currents in the presence of gyki 53655 showed some degree of outward rectification above + 30 mv (figure 2b). such
minor voltage-dependent effects were not accompanied by any
detectable change in response kinetics or use-dependency (data
not shown) which argues against open channel blockade as a
possible, contributory, mode of action for their antagonistic
effects.

 xxxd1783xxx   xxxd1783xxx  (3-300 gm) concentration-dependently potentiated steady-state ampa-induced inward
currents (ec5010.0+2.5 gm) to a greater degree than peak
currents (figure 3c). for example, peak and steady-state currents were potentiated by  xxxd1783xxx  (100 gm) to 290 + 29%
and 1271 + 137% of control respectively (n = 14). the effects of
 xxxd1783xxx  were slow in onset and very slow in offset (figure
3b). this slow offset was almost certainly not a problem of
residual  xxxd1783xxx  in the perfusion pipette but rather seems
to reflect the necessity of agonist binding to its recognition site

interactions of 2,3-benzodiazepines and  xxxd1783xxx 

for  xxxd1783xxx  to dissociate i.e. use-dependent unbinding. in
support of this assumption was the finding that recovery was
twice as quick in experiments where ampa was applied every
7.5 s rather than every 15 s as normal (data not shown). the
effects of  xxxd1783xxx  on current amplitude were accompanied by a slowing of ampa response kinetics (figures 3a
and sb). desensitization of ampa-induced currents was slowed dramatically by  xxxd1783xxx  (3-300 gm) in a concentration-dependent manner, with pronounced effects even at
the lowest concentration tested (e.g. control t = 21.8 + 1.1 ms,
n=35;  xxxd1783xxx  1o mm t =991 +232 ms, n= 13). indeed,
the very slow residual desensitization was so prolonged and
variable (figure 5b), that it probably partially reflects recruitment of additional underlying mechanisms such as rundown or the involvement of other, ion-activated channels in
carrying a component of the potentiated current. these factors
prevented the calculation of an ec50 for  xxxd1783xxx  in
mediating this effect. both onset and offset rates were slowed
by  xxxd1783xxx  in a concentration-dependent manner (figure
5b), this effect being most apparent with the highest concentration tested, namely 300 gm (control tron= 4.7 +0.2 ms,
 xxxd1783xxx  ton = 27.5 + 6.1 ms; control trff= 127.3 + 9.0 ms,
 xxxd1783xxx  toff= 227.8 + 46.3 ms, n = 6). estimation of the
potency of  xxxd1783xxx  in slowing t,,n and toff using the four
parameter logistic equation gave ec50s of 42.1 +4.5 gm and
31.6 + 6.6 gm respectively.
interactions between 2,3-benzodiazepines and  xxxd1783xxx   xxxd1783xxx  concentration-dependently shifted the antagonist concentration-response curves of gyki 52466 and gyki
53405 to the right in a manner suggestive of a common site of
action for these substances (figure 4). e.g. with  xxxd1783xxx 
(10 em) the ic,,s of gyki 52466 and gyki 53405 on steadystate ampa-induced currents were 57.9 + 9.5 and

41.6+ 1.5 gm respectively. this is illustrated for original data
with gyki 52466 in figure 4a where it can clearly be seen that
 xxxd1783xxx  (10 em) potentiated steady-state ampa-induced
inward currents and at the same time decreased the affinity of
gyki 52466 on the same neurone.  xxxd1783xxx  (100 gm)
was able to shift the concentration-response curve of gyki
53405 against ampa-induced inward currents even further to
the right (ic, = 102.3 + 11.6 em; figure 4c).
in the presence of  xxxd1783xxx  (100 mm), gyki 53405 was
unable to reintroduce desensitization and even concentrationdependently slowed the onset kinetics of ampa responses
further (figure 5c and d, ecse 8.8 + 2.8 gm; e.g. with gyki
53405 (100 gm) ton was increased from 24.1 + 1.3 ms to

reverse concentration-dependently the effects of  xxxd1783xxx 
on offset kinetics (figure sc, ic5016.6+4.2 gm; e.g. with
gyki 53405 (100 em) toff was reduced from 192.1 +3.0 ms to
117.5+6.1 ms, n=6). similar effects were seen with gyki
52466 in the presence of  xxxd1783xxx  (10 gm) where e.g.
gyki 52466 (100 gm) was able to decrease toff from
173.4+11.9 ms to 77.8+11.9 ms (ic50 81.3+21.3 gm) but
slowed t,, further from 5.9 + 0.4 to 27.1 + 1.9 ms, n = 7).

mediated e.p.s.cs (icm = 10.8 + 0.8 mm) without having any
substantial effect on response kinetics (figures 6 and 8, table
ia). the slow access of the compound to the slice (figure 6c)
made it difficult to test concentrations below 3 gm with stable
recording conditions.
 xxxd1783xxx   xxxd1783xxx  concentration-dependently enhanced the peak amplitudes of  xxxg981xxx -mediated
e.p.s.cs (figure 7a, table ib). however, the magnitude of this
effect was relatively small and highly variable, which prohibited calculation of a realistic value for its potency in this
regard. in contrast, the effects of  xxxd1783xxx  in prolonging
the decay time constant of  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs
was much clearer and concentration-dependent (ec50
35.7 + 6.5 gm, figures 7 and 9).  xxxd1783xxx  had a less pronounced effect in slowing onset kinetics of ampa receptormediated e.p.s.cs than that seen on ampa-induced currents in
cultured neurones (figures 7b, c, table 1b).
interactions between gyki 52466 and  xxxd1783xxx  in
agreement with our data from cultured superior colliculus
neurones,  xxxd1783xxx  and gyki 52466 showed allosteric
interactions on area cal hippocampal neurones.  xxxd1783xxx  (330 gm) shifted the concentration-response curve for the

 xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs decay time constants to the

our own interpretation of preliminary data on  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs in hippocampal slices and highlight
the need for cautious interpretation of results based on 'onehit' pharmacology (rammes et al., 1994a).
discussion

effects of the 2,3-benzodiazepines

on

ampa-induced

currents

the  xxxg981xxx  antagonistic effects of the 2,3-benzodiazepines observed in the present study in cultured superior
colliculus neurones are largely in line with those previously
reported for cultured hippocampal (donevan & rogawski,
1992; donevan et al., 1994) and cortical neurones (wilding &
huettner, 1995). although previous reports indicate that the
2,3-benzodiazepines are simple non-competitive  xxxg981xxx  antagonists (donevan & rogawski, 1992; donevan et
al., 1994) the present data indicate that these compounds also
allosterically influence the affinity of the agonist recognition
site (see also parsons et al., 1994). this was reflected in the
relative persistence of steady-state ampa-induced currents at
higher concentrations of the 2,3-benzodiazepines, accompanied by slower onset and faster offset kinetics. the relatively
greater inhibition of peak responses by higher concentrations

of the 2,3-benzodiazepines may be due to the inherent lower
affinity of ampa receptors for agonists in the non-desensitized state i.e. at the peak of the response (kiskin et al., 1986;
trussell & fischbach, 1989; patneau & mayer, 1990; 1991;
patneau et al., 1992; hall et al., 1993; hennegriff et al., 1994;
parsons et al., 1994). a decrease in agonist-induced desensitization, similar to the effects of low concentrations of nbqx,
might also contribute to the relative persistence of steady-state
currents at higher antagonist concentrations (parsons et al.,
1994).
it seems unlikely that open channel blockade contributes to
the  xxxg981xxx  antagonistic effects of the 2,3-benzodiazepines. thus, in contrast to the data of zorumski et al.
(1983), there was no evidence of use-dependency for any of the
three compounds tested in the present study or in the studies
of donevan & rogawski, (1993) and parsons et al. (1994).
moreover, whilst the effects of gyki 53655 showed some
degree of voltage-dependency (see also otis et al., 1994), it
should be noted that even control ampa-induced currents
showed relatively weak outward rectification (see also verdoon et al., 1991; jonas & sakmann, 1992; zhang & trussell,
1994).

figure 5 influence of gyki 53405 and  xxxd1783xxx  on the kinetics of ampa-induced inward currents. (a) effects of gyki
53405 alone. concentrations of gyki 53405 above 101im slowed the onset kinetics (t.,) and quickened the offset kinetics (trff) of
ampa-induced inward currents. desensitization kinetics were not affected at concentrations of gyki 53405 up to 30,um; little
desensitization was evident in the small currents recorded at higher concentrations of gyki 53405. t. (0), toff (0b) and
desensitization (*) have been plotted against gyki 53405 concentration (logarithmic). (b) effects of  xxxd1783xxx  alone.
 xxxd1783xxx  slowed both t.. and toff of ampa-induced inward currents in a concentration-dependent manner. desensitization
was greatly reduced at even the lowest concentration of  xxxd1783xxx  tested (3mm). ton (a), tff (a) (1st ordinate) and
desensitization (c>) (2nd ordinate) have been plotted against  xxxd1783xxx  concentration (logarithmic). the ec50 for  xxxd1783xxx 
on t.. was 42.1 ±4.s5im (hill coeff.-1.6±0.33). the ec5' for  xxxd1783xxx  on toff was 31.6+6.61im (hill coeff.- 1.37+0.23). nb:
the first ordinate has also been subdivided into two ranges (0-45ms and 100-280ms). (c) interactions of gyki 53405 and
 xxxd1783xxx . gyki 53405 concentration-dependently reversed the effects of  xxxd1783xxx  (i00 mm) on trff (n), ic-5o= 16.6±4.2jm,

than peak currents. this effect was accompanied by a pronounced reduction of desensitization and a moderate slowing
in both the onset and offset kinetics of ampa responses.
again, these findings are in line with previous reports in cultured hippocampal neurones and indicate that the ampa receptors expressed in the two systems are similar (yamada &
tang, 1993; trussel et al., 1993; patneau et al., 1993; wong
& mayer, 1993). the slowing of ampa offset kinetic by
 xxxd1783xxx  might be taken as evidence that the affinity
of ampa was also increased by  xxxd1783xxx ; a conclusion
that would be supported by biochemical data from desai
et al. (1994). however, the fact that the onset kinetics of
ampa responses were also slower in the presence of  xxxd1783xxx  is hard to reconcile with an increase in ampa
affinity alone.

interactions between  xxxd1783xxx  and the 2,3benzodiazepines on ampa-induced currents
 xxxd1783xxx  shifted the gyki 52466 and gyki 53405
concentration-response curves to the right in a manner suggestive of a common site of action for these two classes of
compound. although, gyki 53405 and gyki 52466 concentration-dependently reversed the effects of  xxxd1783xxx  on
offset kinetics, these 2,3-benzodiazepines were unable to reintroduce desensitization in the presence of  xxxd1783xxx  and
actually concentration-dependently slowed the onset kinetics
of ampa responses further. this observation is similar to the
effects of the 2,3-benzodiazepines on ampa response kinetics
per se and could be taken to imply that the slowing of offset

interactions of 2,3-benzodiazepines and  xxxd1783xxx 
kinetics by  xxxd1783xxx  and subsequent restoration to near
control levels by the addition of the 2,3-benzodiazepines,
purely reflect opposing actions of the two classes of drug on
the apparent affinity of ampa. likewise, in a preliminary
report, yamada & turetsky, (1994) have shown that the
 xxxg981xxx  antagonistic effects of both gyki 52466 and
nbqx are weakened to a similar degree by  xxxd1783xxx . in
contrast, our own provisional data indicate that the allosteric
interaction between nbqx and  xxxd1783xxx  is far less pronounced (rammes et al., 1995).
whatever the underlying mechanism, such data are incompatible with  xxxd1783xxx  acting directly at the 2,3-benzodiazepine site (zorumski et al., 1993) but are still supportive
of allosteric interactions between the two classes of compound.
similar interactions have been reported for 2,3-benzodiazepines and  xxxd1783xxx  on ampa-induced depolarization in
cortical slices (palmer & lodge, 1993) and ampa-induced
increases in free intracellular ca2+ in cultured neurones (hoyt
et al., 1995). in contrast, no such interaction was seen on
ampa- or kainate-induced noradrenaline release in rat hippocampal slices (desai et al., 1995). the reason for this later
discrepancy is unclear but could be related to the slow association kinetics of  xxxd1783xxx , which are even more pronounced in tissue slices (see figure 7d).

and the 2,3-benzodiazepines at ampa receptors was provided
by similar interactions between gyki 52466 and  xxxd1783xxx 
on  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs in hippocampal slices. in
agreement with data from donevan & rogawski, (1993),
gyki 52466 antagonized the peak amplitude of  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs in a concentration-dependent manner
with no apparent effect on response kinetics. the failure to see
any obvious effect of gyki 52466 per se on ampa receptormediated e.p.s.c. response kinetics is probably partially due to
the relatively low inherent affinity of the 2,3-benzodiazepines
in mediating such allosteric interactions i.e. changes in to and
trff would first have been expected at concentrations of gyki
52466 above 30 gm where  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs
were probably too small to assess such effects accurately.  xxxd1783xxx  potentiated  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.c. amplitude and slowed onset kinetics to a variable degree, but had
a more pronounced, concentration-dependent effect on ampa
receptor-mediated e.p.s.c. decay time constants, a finding
which is also in close agreement with previous data (trussell et
al., 1993; pelletier & hablitz, 1994).
 xxxd1783xxx  was able to shift the gyki 52466 concentration-response curve on  xxxg981xxx -mediated
e.p.s.c. peak amplitudes to the right. likewise, gyki 52466
was able to shift the  xxxd1783xxx  concentration-response
curve on  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.c. decay time constants to the right. as in the concentration-clamp experiments,
gyki 52466 also slowed onset kinetics and fastened offset
kinetics of  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs in the presence of
 xxxd1783xxx  (330 gm).

hippocampal slices before (control) and after equilibration in the
presence of gyki 52466 (logm, gykm). additional application of

plotted as means+ s.e.mean against gyki 52466 concentration (pm).
curves were fitted according to the 4 parameter logistic equation.
gyki 52466 ic50= 10.8+0.8 mm; gyki 52466 ic50 with  xxxd1783xxx  (330 gm) = 26.9+9.4mm. the number of cells at each concentration are given in parentheses.

figure 8  xxxd1783xxx 

two points are worth mentioning at this juncture. firstly, the
maximal effects of  xxxd1783xxx  (330 pm) amounted to only a
2.8 fold slowing in  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.c. decay
time constants. the magnitude of this effect is compatible with
that observed for  xxxd1783xxx  on the offset kinetics of
ampa-induced currents but is hard to reconcile with the
pronounced effects of  xxxd1783xxx  on  xxxg981xxx  desensitization. likewise, the potency of  xxxd1783xxx  in slowing
both toff in cultured neurones and  xxxg981xxx -mediated
e.p.s.c. decay time constants was similar, but lower than that
for the potentiation of steady-state ampa-induced currents.
secondly, gyki 52466 was able to reverse the effect of  xxxd1783xxx  on  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.c. decay time
constants. again, this interaction is compatible with that of
 xxxd1783xxx  and 2,3-benzodiazepines on ampa response

into the desensitized state and by effects on the rate constant
for ion channel closure (vyklicky et al., 1991). secondly, zoff of
ampa-induced currents was assessed in the desensitized state.
according to our interpretation, the kinetics of  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs may be governed by the dissociation
kinetics of glutamate from non-desensitized ampa receptors.
in this regard, it would certainly have been pertinent to determine the interactions of  xxxd1783xxx  and 2,3-benzodiazepines on ampa-induced currents following very short i.e. 12 ms applications in outside-out patches. we were not able to
perform such experiments with  xxxd1783xxx  and the 2,3-benzodiazepines with our perfusion system. however,  xxxd181xxx 
has been tested in this manner and was found to slow both
desensitization and offset kinetics of glutamate-induced currents to a similar degree as its prolongation of e.p.s.c. duration
(tang et al., 1991; hestrin, 1992). finally, the possibility that
the interactions of the 2,3-benzodiazepines and  xxxd1783xxx 
on e.p.s.c. kinetics are indirect via effects on glutamate release
mediated at presynaptic ampa receptors cannot be excluded
(trussel et al., 1993; barnes et al., 1994).

figure 9 gyki 52466 weakens the effects of  xxxd1783xxx  on
 xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.c. decay time constants. (a) e.p.s.cs
were recorded before (control, 80 responses) and after equilibration
in the presence of  xxxd1783xxx  (330am) (cyclo, 40 responses).
additional application of gyki 52466 (30 gm) reduced e.p.s.c.
amplitude (c + g, 24 responses). (b) responses depicted in (a) have
been normalized with respect to peak e.p.s.c. amplitude to illustrate
the slowing of decay time constants by  xxxd1783xxx  and the partial
reversal of this effect by gyki 52466 (30/am). (c) concentrationresponse curves for  xxxd1783xxx  in the absence and presence of
gyki 52466 (30-100/am): e.p.s.c. decay kinetics were normalised
with respect to control and have been plotted as means+s.e.mean
against  xxxd1783xxx  concentration (um). the 4 parameter logistic
equation was used to calculate the ec50 for  xxxd1783xxx  alone (i)
of 35.7+6.5pm (nb: the hill coeff. was fixed at 1.0 due to the
inability to test the high concentrations of  xxxd1783xxx  necessary for
an accurate assessment of the maximal effect). an equivalent fit could
not be made with the available data for  xxxd1783xxx  in the presence
of gyki 52466 (30 (0) and 100um (a)). as such data points have
been joined to illustrate the trend for a rightward shift of the

 xxxd1783xxx  concentration-response curve. the number of cells

at

offset kinetics, but cannot be accounted for by interactions at
the level of  xxxg981xxx  desensitization. it therefore
seems likely that  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.c. decay
time constants in area cal hippocampal neurones are not
governed by receptor desensitization. the data are more
consistent with the possibility that the kinetics of ampa
receptor-mediated e.p.s.cs are determined by  xxxg981xxx 
affinity and, in turn, agonist dissociation kinetics. indeed,
clements et al. (1992) and hestrin, (1992) came to a similar
conclusion on the basis of their comparative experiments on
 xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs and responses of outsideout patches to a short pulse of glutamate. in this regard,
previous interpretations that the prolongation of  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs by  xxxd1783xxx  and  xxxd181xxx  can
be taken to provide evidence that the time course of ampa
receptor-mediated synaptic transmission is governed largely
by desensitization should be considered with caution (isaacson & nicoll,

1991;

trussell et

at., 1993; pelletier

& hablitz,

1994; raman et al., 1994).
however, there are also some obvious caveats in our interpretation of the present data. firstly, macroscopic desensitization can be influenced both by effects on the rate of entry

in contrast to the effects of  xxxd1783xxx  on ampa receptormediated e.p.s.cs discussed above, decreased desensitization is
indeed more likely to underlie the potentiation of ampa-induced excitotoxicity by  xxxd1783xxx  in neuronal cultures
(may & robison, 1993b; moudy et al., 1994). as such, it is
perhaps less surprising that the neuroprotective affinity of
gyki 52466 was not observed to be different in the presence
of  xxxd1783xxx  (rock & campbell, 1993). it is at present not
known if an endogenous agonist at the  xxxd1783xxx  recognition site is present in the brain. if such a substance were to be
released under excitotoxic conditions, it might be expected to
exacerbate the toxic activation of ampa receptors by glutamate. if this were indeed to occur, the results of the present
study and that of rock & campbell (1993) might indicate that
the 2,3-benzodiazepines would, if anything, be less potent
under such conditions. similar neurotoxic effects are also seen
with other positive modulators of ampa receptors that decrease desensitization. for example, whilst therapeutically relevant i.e. nm concentrations of  xxxd181xxx  exert
neuroprotective activity in vitro via stimulation of phosphatidyl inositol (pi) hydrolysis, the mm concentrations required to
enhance synaptic transmission and ltp in vitro (ito et al.,
1990; mayersohn et al., 1993) also potentiate ampa receptormediated toxicity in vitro (pizzi et al., 1993).
as such, the development of agents aimed at decreasing
 xxxg981xxx  desensitization may represent the wrong approach to improve cognitive processes (see danysz et al.,
1995b for review). thus, the present data indicate that desensitization does not play the major role in determining the
kinetics of  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs. in contrast, desensitization is indeed more likely to be an endogenous mechanism to counteract the pathological effects of tonic
activation of ampa receptors by sustained, albeit relatively
moderate, increases in extracellular glutamate during e.g.
ischaemia (e.g. globus et al., 1991) or in chronic neurodegenerative diseases (greenamyre et al., 1988; palmer & gershon, 1990, for review see danysz et al., 1995a).
in this regard, the ampakines may have a more promising
profile than agents such as  xxxd1783xxx  as they may have been
reported to enhance peak ampa-induced currents more than
 xxxd1783xxx  but steady-state currents less than  xxxd1783xxx 
(arai et al., 1994). this may indicate that they have a greater
effect on  xxxg981xxx  affinity than on desensitization. such
properties could also underlie their promising preclinical profile in models of long-term potentiation (ltp) and learning in
normal animals (granger et al., 1993; staubli et al., 1994a, b;
coogan et al., 1994). however, a further caveat to this approach is the fact that positive modulation of ampa receptors
would be expected to affect most glutamatergic synapses in the

g. rammes et al

brain and not just those where synaptic plasticity is desired i.e.
they might be predicted to have effects reminiscent of central
stimulants like amphetamine.

dence that the decay time constants of these synaptic events
may be partially governed by the offset kinetics of glutamate at
ampa receptors and not by desensitization.

conclusions
 xxxd1783xxx  and the 2,3-benzodiazepines seem to bind to
different sites on the  xxxg981xxx  but exert relatively
strong allosteric interactions with one another and with other
domains such as the ampa recognition site. the interactions
of gyki 52466 and  xxxd1783xxx  on  xxxg981xxx -mediated e.p.s.cs in area cai of hippocampal slices provide evi-

the authors wish to thank kath clark for her advice in performing
'blind' patch clamp recordings from area cal neurones in
hippocampal slices.
