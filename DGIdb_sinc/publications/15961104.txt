 xxxd3266xxx , a synthetic polysulfonated compound, developed initially for the
treatment of african trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis, is currently used
for the treatment of several medically relevant disorders.  xxxd3266xxx , heparin,
and other polyanions inhibit the myotoxic activity of lys49 phospholipase
a2 analogues both in vitro and in vivo, and are thus of potential importance
as therapeutic agents in the treatment of viperid snake bites. due to its
conformational flexibility around the single bonds that link the central
phenyl rings to the secondary amide backbone, the symmetrical  xxxd3266xxx 
molecule binds by an induced-fit mechanism complementing the
hydrophobic surfaces of the dimer and adopts a novel conformation that
lacks c2 symmetry in the dimeric crystal structure of the  xxxd3266xxx –bothrops
asper myotoxin ii complex. the simultaneous binding of  xxxd3266xxx  at the
surfaces of the two monomers partially restricts access to the nominal
active sites and significantly changes the overall charge of the interfacial
recognition face of the protein, resulting in the inhibition of myotoxicity.

a-thrombin, protein-tyrosine phosphatases, g proteins, merozoite surface protein-1, and acidic and
basic fibroblast growth factors.5–14  xxxd3266xxx  prevents the development of muscle necrosis induced
by some snake venoms, since it inhibits the
myotoxic and in vitro neuromuscular blocking
activities of lys49 phospholipases a2 from bothrops
species.15,16
phospholipases a2 ( xxxg1760xxx : ec 3.1.1.4) are key
enzymes in the control, regulation, production and
release of lipid mediator precursors that serve as
messengers in fundamental, highly regulated processes such as growth, adhesion, apoptosis,
secretion, hemostasis and immune regulation. the
group ii  xxxg1760xxx  encountered in viperid snake
venoms and mammalian fluids share significant
sequence homology, and are based on a single
structural motif or scaffold.17 snake venom  xxxg1760xxx

myotoxic, neurotoxic, cardiotoxic, anticoagulant,
platelet-aggregating, hypotensive and inflammatory
effects.18 on the basis of sequence and structural
similarities, the snake venom group ii  xxxg1760xxx  can be
subdivided into (a) the catalytically active asp49
enzymes and (b) the basic, myotoxic lys49 proteins,
which possess no catalytic activity.17 myotoxicity

affects only muscle fibers without damaging other
tissue structures such as connective tissue, nerves
and vessels,19 and can lead to permanent tissue loss,
disability, amputation and death.20
 xxxd3266xxx  binds to a surprisingly wide variety of
proteins of different function, structure and size due
to its torsional flexibility and ability to stretch or
compress itself, which results in the two naphthyl
rings with the sulfonate groups being able to
interact simultaneously with a number of structurally distinct sites. due to a lack of structural
information, the target sites, conformational flexibility and mode of binding of  xxxd3266xxx  to proteins
are still unclear at the atomic level.
the crystal structure of the complex between
 xxxd3266xxx  and bothrops asper myotoxin ii represents
the first crystal structure of  xxxd3266xxx  bound to a
protein. the structural details presented here
should be of relevance in understanding the steric
requirements of  xxxd3266xxx  binding to proteins, and
should shed light on the mechanism of myotoxicity
displayed by lys49 phospholipases a2 and their
inhibition by polyanionic compounds.

results
in vitro myotoxicity
as illustrated in figure 1(a), b. asper myotoxin ii
caused a time-dependent increase in the rate of
creatine kinase release from isolated extensor
digitorum longus muscles. a more pronounced
effect is observed after 90 minutes with 25 mg/ml of
b. asper myotoxin ii alone. the presence of  xxxd3266xxx 
(10 mm) together with the toxin markedly inhibits
the creatine kinase release induced by the b. asper
myotoxin ii (basp-ii). after 90 minutes of exposure
to the toxin, in the presence of  xxxd3266xxx , the creatine
kinase release was less than 15% of the value
measured in the absence of  xxxd3266xxx .

in vivo myotoxicity
intramuscular (i.m.) injections of basp-ii alone
increased plasma creatine kinase (ck) activity in a
dose and time-dependent fashion. figure 1(b)
indicates that an i.m. injection of basp-ii (2.0 mg/
g) induced a significant increase in plasma ck
activity compared to physiological saline solution.
ck levels increased from 65(g42) units/l (meang
sem, nz4) to 1368( xxxg386xxx ) units/l (nz4) after two
hours. these values of plasma ck activity are in
agreement with previously reported observations.21
preincubation with  xxxd3266xxx  significantly (p!0.05)
inhibits the increase in plasma ck activity induced
by basp-ii. experiments performed following protocol b (see materials and methods) indicate that
 xxxd3266xxx  also significantly inhibits (p!0.05) the
plasma ck activity increment induced by basp-ii.
however, under these conditions,  xxxd3266xxx  was less
effective in antagonizing myotoxicity than when
incubated with basp-ii prior to injection. figure 2
presents light micrographs of extensor digitorum
longus muscle exposed to either basp-ii (figure 2(b)
and (b 0 )), basp-ii pre-incubated with  xxxd3266xxx 
(1 mg/kg) (figure 2(c) and (c 0 )) or post-treated
with  xxxd3266xxx  (1 mg/kg) 15 minutes after basp-ii
injection. in all samples, normal muscle cells were
observed in the central region of the muscle,
whereas the peripheral fibers were in different
stages of necrosis, characterized by densely
clumped myofibrils and swollen cells. pre-incubation or post-treatment with  xxxd3266xxx  resulted in a
reduction in the number of necrotic fibers
(figure 2(c) and (d)).

refinement, the electron density maps indicated the
presence of a bound  xxxd2982xxx  (peg)
molecule in both the monomers in the hydrophobic
channels that leads to the active sites. as in the
crystal structure of the highly homologous bothropstoxin-i, a lys49  xxxg1759xxx  (pla2) from the

venom of bothrops jararacussu, the hydroxyl groups
of peg form hydrogen bonds to his48  xxxg1457xxx  (figure 3)
and the extended tails of the bound peg molecules
occupy the positions of the  xxxd2154xxx  (figure 4(a))
of the phospholipid analogue (pdb id, 1poe).22
the refinement converged to a crystallographic
residual of 20.5% (rfreez24.0%) for all data between
30.0 å and 1.70 å (table 1). the final model consists
of the 242 amino acid residues, 170 solvent
molecules, five isopropanol molecules, two fragments of peg 3350 and a  xxxd3266xxx  molecule. the
crystal structure is characterized by excellent
stereochemistry, as indicated by an analysis of the
deviations from ideal values of the bond lengths,
bond angles, planarity and non-bonded contacts
(table 1). the two molecules in the asymmetric unit
are related by a 2-fold axis of rotation, and the
hydrophobic surfaces surrounding the entrance to
the active sites form the dimer interface, resulting in
the burial of 3446 å2 of the surface area of each
molecule (30.9%).
the structure of group iia  xxxg1760xxx  has been
reviewed extensively,17,23 and consists of three
a-helices, a short b-wing and connecting loops
(figure 3). the principal, highly conserved structural feature is a platform formed by the two long
anti-parallel disulfide-linked (cys29-cys45 and
cys51-cys98) a-helices (helices 2 and 3, residues
37–54 and 90–109) on which are located the amino
acid residues considered important for catalytic
activity (his48, asp49, tyr52, tyr73 and asp99).
the interfacial recognition surface contains a wide
hydrophobic collar and provides access to the
catalytic site. in the case of catalytically active
asp49  xxxg1760xxx , his48 and asp99 together with a
structurally conserved water molecule (hydrogen
bonded to his48  xxxg1457xxx ) participate in the nucleophilic
attack at the sn-2 position of the phospholipid
substrate. the tetrahedral transition state intermediate is stabilized by a calcium ion and is
coordinated by asp49 and the main-chain atoms
located in the calcium-binding loop. in the subgroup of lys49 pla2 analogues, substitution of
asp49 by lys results in the nz atom of lys49
occupying the position of the calcium ion in asp49
 xxxg1760xxx .17,24 these lys49  xxxg1760xxx  are capable of
binding  xxxd2154xxx ,25 stearic acid26 and peg. the
controversy as to whether these enzymes possess
catalytic activity27–29 has been clarified, since no
substrate hydrolysis was detected with the wildtype recombinant protein.30

nmr experiments indicate that the conformational flexibility at a3/a3 0 and a4/a4 0 and the
c2 symmetry enable  xxxd3266xxx  to adopt multiple
conformations wherein the two sulfonated
naphthyl rings are separated by distances
between 16 å and 30 å in the compact and fully
extended conformations, respectively (figure 5).9

hydrogen bonds to arg34 and lys53 (figures 4(b)

interacts with hydrophobic amino acid residues in
the loop that links helix 2 with the b-wing (residues

by hydrophobic interactions with residues surrounding the active site and the n terminus. the

discussion
myonecrosis is a major event in envenomation by
snakes and compounds such as  xxxd3266xxx , heparin,
heparin-like glycosaminoglycans and related polyanions inhibit the activity of myotoxic  xxxg1760xxx  both
in vitro and in vivo.31–35 a number of studies have

regions important for the expression of myotoxicity

with the biochemical and structural information
currently available we are now able to probe the
structure–function relationship, and the mode of
action and inhibition of lys49 pla2 analogues by
addressing the roles of the c-terminal region and
the nominal active site in myotoxicity.

1xmn). this leads us to speculate that this highly
conserved sulfate-binding site could represent the
primary heparin-binding site in basp-ii. in this
orientation, the heparin molecule could extend
towards the c-terminal region, interacting with
residues 115–129, which contain the motif b–b–x–b
(where b denotes a basic amino acid) and a total of
six basic residues out of 13.34 this is analogous to
the interaction in the  xxxd3266xxx – xxxg787xxx  complex
model, where the induced-fit binding of  xxxd3266xxx 
sterically blocks the receptor-binding region of
 xxxg787xxx  and competes for the binding of heparin.47

 xxxd3266xxx  and its inhibitory effects

the role of the c terminus

since the conformational flexibility of  xxxd3266xxx  is
restricted to rotations around the single bonds, the
simultaneous binding of the naphthalene rings to
the two protein molecules perturbs the putative
calcium-binding loop and the c-terminal extensions.
the interfacial recognition face (i-face) of myotoxic lys49  xxxg1760xxx  contains a high density of
positive charges, a structural feature that has been
associated with the ability of these proteins to
interact with phospholipid bilayers.23,41 the
induced-fit binding of  xxxd3266xxx  results in the burial
of 102.1 å 2 (total surface area of suraminz
335.1 å2), does not directly involve amino acid
residues in the putative catalytic site but modifies
the surface charge significantly (figure 7). this
change in the charge on the i-face plays a crucial
role in the inhibition of myotoxicity, since basp-ii
would now be unable to bind to the negatively
charged membrane target in muscle cells.

the c-terminal region (residues 115–134) of
myotoxic lys49  xxxg1760xxx  forms a cationic/hydrophobic site that has been suggested to play a role
in the mediation of electrostatic interactions with
negatively charged acceptors, acting as a cytolytic
motif.34,44,45,48 a synthetic peptide corresponding to
residues 115–129 of basp-ii induces cytolysis,
interferes with the interaction between heparin
and basp-ii, and binds directly to radiolabeled
heparin in solution.34 although the i.m. injection
of this peptide failed to induce myotoxicity in
mice,28,49 the corresponding analogous peptides of
related lys49  xxxg1760xxx  from agkistrodon piscivorus
piscivorus45 and agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus28
venoms are myonecrotic. site-directed mutagenesis
has further demonstrated the importance of specific
residues in the c-terminal region for the development of myotoxic activity in another lys49 pla2
from b. jararacussu venom, bothropstoxin-i.46 substitution of lys and arg residues with ala in the c
terminus results in a significant loss of myotoxic
activity of the recombinant bothropstoxin-i.46
the crystal structure of basp-ii (pdb code, 1clp)
determined in the absence of a ligand results in the
exposure of the hydrophobic residues in the
c-terminal region, which are referred to collectively

as the hydrophobic knuckle (residues leu121 and
leu124), due to the interaction of lys122 with the
peptide bond formed between cys29 and gly30.25
superpositioning the structures of this protein in
the ligand-free state and when bound to  xxxd3266xxx 
results in an overall rmsd of 0.6 å. the largest
deviations are observed in the putative calciumbinding loop (rmsd 0.9 å for residues 28–35), at the
base of the b-wing, which is generally disordered
(rmsd greater than 1.5 å for residues 86–87) and in
the c-terminal region (rmsd between 0.9 å and
1.8 å for residues 120–129). an analysis of these
deviations indicates that the binding of  xxxd3266xxx 
does not alter the interactions that are responsible
for maintaining the conformation of the hydrophobic knuckle but results in a rigid-body shift of
the motif formed by the putative calcium-binding
loop and c terminus.
in our x-ray model, the c-terminal region does
not form part of the  xxxd3266xxx -binding site of the
dimer, but contributes significantly to the maintenance of the positive charge on the i-face, which is
important for the binding of the myotoxin to the
phospholipid bilayers. thus, the c terminus,
besides being involved in the development of
myonecrosis, also likely plays a dual role by
maintaining the positive charge on the i-face and
interacting with the putative calcium-binding loop.
the putative active site
lys49 pla 2s are capable of binding fatty
acids,25,50  xxxd3244xxx ,26 and peg at the nominal
catalytic site. the induced-fit binding of  xxxd3266xxx  at
the surface does not completely block access to the
nominal active site. thus, the active site is still
accessible to  xxxd2154xxx , as evidenced by the
presence of peg molecules bound to his48, which
occupy positions analogous to lysophospholipids in
the structure of human group iia pla2 (pdb id,
1poe; figure 4(a)) complexed with the transition-state
analogue (l1-o-octyl-2-heptylphosphonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine). a direct relationship
between the active site and the c terminus in a
lys49 pla2 has been proposed by the hyperpolarization of the hydrogen bond formed by lys122 ne
and the peptide bond between residues cys29 and
gly30.25

 xxxd3266xxx  can bind to, it is tempting to speculate that
it may interact with other  xxxg1760xxx  from venoms and
other sources including mammalian group iia
 xxxg1760xxx , thus suggesting a wider pharmacological
potential for this inhibitor and these structural
results should serve as the basis for the development of novel naphthalene sulfonate derivatives.

(25 mg/ml) or the basp-ii plus  xxxd3266xxx  (10 mm) were
added to the solution containing the extensor digitorum
longus (edl) muscles and then the perfusates were
collected and replaced with fresh pss. the collected
samples were stored at 4 8c. ck activity was determined
by using a diagnostic kit (sigma chemical co., usa). the
rate of ck release from the isolated muscles was
expressed as the increase in ck release compared to
control values. basal release rate refers to the enzyme loss
from the muscles into the pss medium during the
equilibration period of perfusion (one hour), starting
immediately after the preparation had been mounted in
the sample-collection unit. the ck activity was expressed
in international units (u), where 1 u is the amount that
catalyzes the transformation of 1 mmol of substrate at
25 8c. the rate of ck release from the isolated muscle was
expressed as enzyme units released into the medium per
gram per one hour of collection (u  xxxd955xxx  hk1).31,32

concluding remarks
in vivo myotoxicity

these results suggest strongly that  xxxd3266xxx  is a
potentially useful drug in the prevention of acute
muscle toxicity associated with bothrops sp. snakebite envenomation, since it is highly effective in
inhibiting the myotoxic activity of basp-ii in vitro
and in vivo, pre-incubated or administered alone
after injection of the toxin. the structural results
indicate that the relative orientation of the putative
calcium-binding loop and c-terminal regions
together with the maintenance of the charge pattern
on the i-face could be important for myotoxicity in
lys49  xxxg1760xxx . due to the diversity of proteins that

changes in plasma ck activity
basp-ii was dissolved in 0.1 ml of pss and injected by
the i.m. route into the thighs of swiss mice (20–25 g body
weight). the amounts of toxin or  xxxd3266xxx  administered
were adjusted taking into account the weight of each
animal and injected in doses of 2.0 mg/g for the toxin and
1.0 mg/g for  xxxd3266xxx . previous studies indicate that i.m.
injection of 0.1 ml of pss has no effect on plasma ck
activity.21,32 two different experimental protocols were
used; in protocol a, basp-ii and  xxxd3266xxx  were incubated
for 15 minutes at 37 8c, and then injected i.m. into each

424
animal. in protocol b, basp-ii was administered i.m. to the
animals 15 minutes before the intraperitoneal injection of
 xxxd3266xxx  (1.0 mg/g). in both protocols, the final volume of
toxin injected, either alone or with  xxxd3266xxx , was 0.1 ml.
the animals were anesthetized lightly with  xxxd2052xxx 
immediately before and two hours after the injection of
the toxin for blood collection, in accordance with
guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals.52
plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at
4 8c for subsequent determination of ck activity as
described above.

histological alterations
mice, weighing 25.0(g5.0) g, were assembled into four
groups of three mice each. animals were anesthetized
with ether, and subsequently injected with basp-ii
(2.5 mg/g in 50 ml of pss). injection was performed just
over the edl muscle of the right limb, as described.53 the
control group was injected only with pss in the right paw
(50 ml). two different experimental protocols were used
for the study of  xxxd3266xxx  antimyotoxic effect. in the first
protocol, the basp-ii was incubated with  xxxd3266xxx  (1 mg/
kg) for 15 minutes prior to the injection of the mixture. in
the second protocol,  xxxd3266xxx  (1 mg/kg) was injected i.v.
15 minutes after the injection of basp-ii. the mice were
anesthetized with ether and sacrificed by cervical
dislocation 24 hours after the injection of the toxin. the
edl muscles were dissected and fixed for two to three
hours in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (ph 7.4). they
were subsequently washed thrice in the same buffer and
post-fixed for one hour in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide.
the tissue was then dehydrated in increasing concentrations of acetone (30–100%, v/v) and embedded in
polybed 812 resin. sections (400–600 nm) for light
microscopic examination were obtained using an rmc
ultramicrotome and stained with 1% (w/v) toluidine
blue dye.
crystallization and x-ray diffraction data collection
basp-ii was dissolved at a concentration of 10 mg/ml
in 0.02 m hepes (ph 7.5) and  xxxd3266xxx  was added at a
molar ratio of 1:1.2. this complex was crystallized from a
solution containing 0.1 m sodium acetate (ph 4.6), 15%
(w/v) peg 3350, 20% (v/v) isopropanol at 291 k by the
hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method as described.54
x-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 k from a
single crystal at a synchrotron radiation source (pcr
beamline, laboratório nacional de luz sincrotron, lnls,
campinas, brazil) where the wavelength was set to
1.427 å. diffraction intensities were measured using a
marccd detector (mar research), and the diffraction
data were integrated, reduced and processed using the
denzo/scalepack suite of programs.55
structure determination and refinement
the atomic coordinates of basp-ii24 (pdb id, 1clp)
were utilized to solve the structure by molecular
replacement with the program package amore.56 noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed in the
early cycles of refinement and the translation-librationscrew, positional and restrained isotropic b-factor refinements were carried out using refmac5,57 and the electron
density maps were examined after each round of

inhibition of b. asper mytotoxin ii by  xxxd3266xxx 
refinement with turbo-frodo.58 the stereochemistry
of the final structure was evaluated using procheck.59
protein data bank accession code
the atomic coordinates and structure factors of the
basp-iicsuramin complex have been deposited with the
protein data bank (accession code: 1y4l).
