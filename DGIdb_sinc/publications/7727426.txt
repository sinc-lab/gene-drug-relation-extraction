a novel isoform of the human  xxxg807xxx  (fr, type y ) was recently identified in
hematopoietic tissues [shen et al. (1994) biochemistry 33, 1209-12151. in that report, cos-1 cells,
transiently transfected with the cdna for fr-y, produced relatively poor expression of the receptor on
the cell surface. in this study, several recombinant chinese hamster ovary (cho) cell lines were produced]
by stable transfection with the cdna for fr-y followed by amplification. similar recombinant cho
cell lines were produced that expressed the glycosylphosphatidylinositol- (gpi-) anchored fr type p and
a truncated form of fr type p (fr-pa), in which the normal carboxyl-terminal signal for gpi anchor
attachment was deleted. both fr-y- and fr-pa-expressing cho cells produced a [3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding
protein in the medium with a similar time course over a 24-h period; in contrast to intact fr-p, relatively
insignificant amounts of either fr-y or fr-pa were associated with the cho cell surface and this was
unaltered by the absence of serum in the medium. the fr-y- and fr-pa-producing cho cells did not
differ significantly in intracellular fr levels. furthermore, the mrna level for fr-y did not exceed that
for fr-pa. when deglycosylated with hydrogen fluoride, both f r - y and fr-pa showed similar apparent
molecular weights on western blots as predicted for the intact polypeptides. chimeric constructs of fr-y
and fr-p cdnas resulting in interchanging of the unconserved, carboxyl-terminal segments of the two
proteins were expressed in human 293 fibroblasts; the results indicate that fr-y is primarily a secretory
protein due to a divergence of its carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence from the other members of the
fr gene family, resulting in an inefficient signal for gpi modification. the relative affinities of the
secreted fr-y for  xxxd2146xxx  and the diastereoisomers of reduced folate compounds were in the order folic
acid ( k d= 0.42 x
m) > (65')/(6r)-ns-methyltetrahydrofolate > (65')/(6r)-ns-formyltetrahydrofolate.
evidence is presented that expression of the secreted full-length fr-y is restricted to certain hematopoietic
cell types. fr-y is, therefore, a potential serum marker for certain malignancies of hematopoietic tissues
and also a candidate protein for the high-affinity serum folate binder that is elevated during folate deficiency.
abstract:

the  xxxg807xxx  (fr) is an n-glycosylated protein
consisting of a single polypeptide of molecular weight
-28 000 da (antony, 1992). the receptor binds folate with
a 1:l stoichiometry (antony, 1992). the initial report of a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol(gpi) membrane anchor for fr
(lacey et al., 1989) was confirmed by others (luhrs &
slomiany, 1989; verma et al., 1992). it has been proposed
that the soluble  xxxg807xxx  (sfbp) in the serum
and in tissue culture medium is derived from its membranebound counterpart either by proteolysis or by the action of
serum phospholipase (luhrs & slomiany, 1989; verma et
al., 1992; antony et al., 1989; elwood et al., 1991). recent
studies have shown that malignant tissues have elevated
expression of fr suggesting its potential exploitation for the
diagnosis or targeting of malignant tumors with antibodies
or alternately for the transport of potent, novel, chemotherapeutic antifolate drugs (campbell et al., 1991; coney et al.,
1991, weitman et al., 1992, ross et al., 1994).
multiple isoforms of fr that are 70-80% identical have
been identified in human and mouse tissues by molecular
cloning (ratnam et al., 1989; lacey et al., 1989; elwood,

1989; brigle et al., 1992; shen et al., 1994). the receptor
isoforms in the same species differ in their affinities and
stereospecificities for folate compounds and antifolates
(wang et al., 1992; brigle et al., 1994). the human fr
isoforms are tissue-specific. in general, fr-a is specific for
primary cultures of epithelial cells and is elevated in explants
of various carcinomas while fr-p is elevated in malignant
tumors of nonepithelial origin (ross et al., 1994). we
recently identified a third human fr isoform (type y) and a
corresponding truncated form (fr-y') (shen et al.. 1994).
fr-yand fr-y' appear to be quite specific for hematopoietic
tissues (shen et al., 1994). the functional differences among
the fr isoforms and their tissue specificities further render
them attractive targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.
we observed that when the cdna for fr-y was expressed
transiently in cos-1 cells, the increase in cell surface
associated [3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding protein was very low ( < 2 8 )
compared to transfections with the cdnas for other fr
isoforms (shen et al., 1994). in addition, significant amounts
of fr-y were not detected in the cos- 1 cell culture medium
in the very short-term transfection experiments using frp-specific antibodies. furthermore, the very high concentrations of folate in the cos-1 cell culture medium interfered
with direct quantitation of [3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding protein in
the medium. in this study, we further investigated those ob-

servations by establishing stably transfected chinese hamster
ovary (cho) cells with amplified expression of fr-y.
the unconserved carboxyl-terminal segments of fr-aand
fr-p are relatively hydrophobic and are characteristic of the
proteolytically processed signal peptide for gpi attachment
in the endoplasmic reticulum (caras, 1991). inspection of
the amino acid sequence of the corresponding carboxylterminal segment of fr-y revealed that it is shorter and less
hydrophobic than those of fr-a and fr-p, although similar
features occur in the gpi signal sequences of several proteins
(sikorav et al., 1987; boothroyd, 1985; seki et al., 1985;
millan, 1986). herein, we test the hypothesis that fr-y is
poorly expressed on the cell surface because it lacks an
efficient signal for gpi anchor attachment. since the
inability to process a gpi signal peptide could result in
retention and degradation of the protein in intracellular
membrane compartments (field et al., 1994), we examined
the fate of fr-y in the recombinant cho cells. for controls
in these studies, we produced stable recombinant cho cells
with amplified expression of fr type p and also fr-/3 in
which the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic segment was
deleted (fr-pa) and, therefore, would be expected to be
secreted in the medium. in addition, chimeric constructs of
fr-b and fr-y were produced and transiently expressed in
human 293 fibroblasts in order to test the possible role of
the carboxyl-terminal portion of fr-y in determining its final
destination. in these studies, cells were grown in low-folate
(physiologic) medium in order to enable quantitative removal
of folate from the medium prior to [3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding
assays. the folate binding properties of fr-y were characterized. finally, possible cell type specificity of the fulllength fr-y (243 residues) vs the truncated (104 residue)
fr-y‘ polypeptide was investigated.

materials and methods
cell culture. all cell culture media were supplemented
with 50 000 units of penicillin, 50 000 pg of streptomycin,
and 146 mg of glutamine (gibco-brl, grand island, ny)
per 500 ml of medium. cells were purchased from
american type culture collection (rockville, md) unless
otherwise indicated. tissue culture media were purchased
from irvine scientific (santa anna, ca) unless otherwise
indicated. human 293 fibroblasts were grown in eagle’s
minimal essential medium (mem) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (fbs, gibco-brl). cho cells deficient in  xxxg631xxx  (cho-dhfr- cells) were grown in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium (dmem) and 10% fbs, supplmented with 75 mg of  xxxd2434xxx  and 5 mg each of adenosine,
deoxyadenosine, and thymidine (sigma chemical co., st.
louis, mo) per 500 ml of medium. cho cell transfectants
containing the neomycin resistance gene were grown in the
above-described medium containing 1 mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx 
(active concentration: 0.7 mg/ml; gibco-brl). transfectants containing both the neomycin resistance gene and the
 xxxg631xxx  gene were grown in the abovedescribed medium with various concentrations of methotrexate (mtx; sigma chemical co.) instead of nucleosides.
cho cell transfectants were alternately grown in folate-free
rpmi 1640 supplemented with all the appropriate components, as described above. hl-60 cells were grown in rpmi
1640 medium with 20% fbs. for growth in serum-free
conditions, the parental and recombinant cho cells were
transferred to mccoy’s 5a medium (sigma) supplemented
with human transfenin (4 pg/ml), bovine pancreas insulin
(20 pg/ml), and  xxxg681xxx  (50 ng/ml).

tissues. spleen samples, leukocyte fractions of bone
marrow aspirates, and normal and malignant human tissues
were purchased from the cooperative human tissue network (chtn), columbus, oh.
construction of plasmids and transfections. the cdna
for fr-y (nucleotide 6-850) was placed between hind111
and xbai sites in the polylinker region of the expression
vector pcdnaineo (invitrogen) and the resulting plasmid
(fr-y-pcdnaineo) was amplified in escherichia coli
mc1061/p3. transfections into cho cells were carried out
using lipofectamine (gibco-brl) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
production of recombinant cho cells. cho-dhfr- cells
were transfected with fr-y-pcdnaineo. transfectants
expressing the neomycin resistance gene were selected by
growing in 1 mg of geneticidml (active concentration 0.7
mg/ml) for 20 days. the cells were then transfected with
a second plasmid (psv2) containing the dhfr gene (psv2dhfr). this plasmid has a dna sequence that is in part
homologous to that of pcdnaineo. the genes in the
transfected cells were amplified by stepwise selection in
methotrexate (10 nm-2 pm). stable cho cell transfectants
were plated out at a dilution of 200 cells/l5-cm plate and
grown for 14 days. isolated clones were picked using
cloning rings and further subcloned by the same procedure.
northern blot analysis. total rna (15 pg) from each
sample was electrophoresed through a 1.o% agarose gel and
blotted onto a nylon membrane essentially as described (ross
et al., 1994). an oligonucleotide, 58 bases long, with the
sequence 5‘-gccagcaccagccaggagctgcacaaggacacctcccgcctgtacaactttaactggg-3’ was
labeled with 32p,and hybridization of the northern blot was
carried out as described (ross et al., 1994). this oligonucleotide spans a region perfectly conserved between fr-p
and fr-y and should therefore bind to the two transcripts
with equal affinity.
the filter was erased by pouring boiling 0.1% sds over
it and allowing the solution to come to room temperature.
removal of the probe was verified by autoradiography. the
filter was rehybridzed with a probe for detecting p-actin
“a.
the template for the p-actin probe was prepared
by amplifying a 660 base pair p-actin cdna fragment by
polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr primers were
purchased from stratagene and have the following sequences:
sense

s’-tgacggggtcacccacactgtgcccatcta-3’
antisense

s’-ctagaagcattgcggtggacgatggaggg-3’
the probe was labeled and the hybridization was carried out
as described above.
production of chimeric cdna constructs and transient
expression in 293 cells. chimeric constructs of fr-p and
fr-y were made by exchanging their unconserved carboxylterminal hydrophobic peptides. a common not1 site (at
nucleotide 861 in fr-,8 and at nucleotide 625 in fr-y) in
the two cdnas was used for this purpose. the cdnas for
fr-p and fr-7 and the chimeric fr-ply and fry//?cdnas
were placed in the polylinker region of the vector pcdnai
and used to transfect human 293 cells using lipofectamine
(gibco-brl) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the
cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. untransfected

cells and cells transfected with the vector without a cdna
insert were used as negative controls in all experiments.
[jh] xxxd2146xxx  binding assays. [3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding
assays were performed on both cell-surface and soluble fr.
in the binding assay of cell-surface fr, cells (3 x lo6) in
the logarithmic phase of growth or 48 h after transfection
were washed in a 35-mm tissue culture dish at 4 "c, once
with hanks'  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss; 1 ml), twice with
acid saline (10 mm sodium acetate, ph 3.5, and 150 mm
nacl; 1 ml), and once again with hbss (1 d).
the cells
were then incubated with 2 pmol of [3h] xxxd2146xxx  (moravek)
in 1 ml of hbss at 4 "c for 1 h. after. the cells were
washed at 4 "c. once with 1 ml of hbss, cell-surface bound
[3h] xxxd2146xxx  was recovered in 0.5 ml of acid saline and
subjected to liquid scintillation counting. for the binding
assay of soluble fr, cell culture medium (folate-free rpmi
1640) was collected and the ph was lowered to 3.5 by the
addition of i/lo volume of 100 mm sodium acetate, ph 2.5,
at 4 "c. simultaneously triton x-100 was added to a final
concentration of 1%. then an equal volume of an ice-cold
suspension of norit a charcoal (80 mg/ml) in 10 mm
sodium acetate, ph 3.0, and 1% triton x-100 was added to
remove endogenous  xxxd2146xxx . the ph of the medium was
adjusted back to 7.5 using a pretitered amount of naoh.
aliquots of the treated medium were taken for the assay in
a final volume of 0.5 ml. the samples were incubated with
2 pmol of [3h] xxxd2146xxx  at 37 "c for 2 h, and [3h] xxxd2146xxx 
binding protein was assayed by a charcoal binding assay as
described (wang et al.. 1992). intracellular  xxxd2146xxx  binding
protein was estimated by the same procedure used to estimate
the protein in the medium except that whole cells were first
dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, ph 7 3 1 5 0 mm
nacl/l% triton x-1 00 before acidification with sodium
acetate.
phospholipase c cleavage. cells ( 3 x lo6) in the
logarithmic phase of growth were washed at 4 "c, once with
1 ml of hbss. twice with 1 ml of acid saline, and once
again with 1 ml of hbss. the cells were treated with
phospholipase c (1.5 units) (boehringer mannheim, indianapolis, in) in 1 ml of 25 mm tris-hc1, ph 7.5, 250 mm
sucrose. 10 mm glucose, and 1% bovine serum .albumin at
37 "c for 2 h. following this, ["hlfolic acid binding assay
was carried out as described above.
antiserum und afjinity-purified antibodies. a rabbit
antiserum to purified fr from placenta was obtained as
described (ratnam et al.. 1989). purified placental fr was
immobilized on ah-sepharose (pharmacia) and the fraction
of the igg in the rabbit antiserum that specifically bound to
the immobilized fr was purified as described (ratnam et
al.. 1989).
westrrn blot analysis. western blot analysis of protein
samples from cell culture medium was carried out using
affinity-purified rabbit antibody to purified human placental
fr as the primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase
conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (promega) as described
previously (wang et al., 1992).
deglycosylution. proteins from culture medium (200 pl)
were lyophilized and deglycosylated by treatment with
anhydrous hf as described (sojar & bahl, 1987).
kideterminations. ki values for the inhibition of [3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding to fr-y by  xxxd2146xxx  and reduced folate
coenzymes were determined as described (wang et al., 1992).
ldentifiicution of transcripts for fr-y and fr-y'. total
rna was prepared and reverse-transcribed, and a 735 or

shen et al.
733 base pair fragment of the cdna for either fr-y or fry', respectively, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) using a 32p-labeled"upstream" oligonucleotide primer
and an unlabeled "downstream" primer as described previously (shen et al., 1994). fr-y' contains a 2-base deletion
resulting in an in-frame stop codon within this cdna
fragment. the 2-base deletion in fr-y' fortuitously generates a ddei restriction site that is absent in fr-y. a second
ddei restriction site occurs downstream of this site in both
fr-y and fr-y' within the pcr-amplified cdna fragment.
digestion of the pcr product with ddei should give rise to
32p-labeled end fragments of 484 and 316 base pairs,
respectively, for fr-y and fr-y'. the pcr product was
subjected to ddei digestion. the 32p-labeledcdna fragments were then analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described (shen et al., 1994)
with the inclusion of 32p-end-labeledmolecular size standards
(1-kb ladder; gibco-brl). the oligonucleotide sequences
used for pcr amplification were (5' to 3') ggacatggcctggcagatgatgc (32p-labeled upstream primer) and
caggaatcaataatcccacgagacgg (unlabeled
downstream primer).

results and discussion
in contrast to the highly expressed gpi-anchored fr
isoforms, a and p, the cell surface expression of fr-y in
transiently transfected cos-1 cells (shen et al., 1994) is poor
and could be explained by any one or a combination of the
following broad reasons: (i) poor expression per se of fr-y
in cos-1 cells due to several possible factors, including rapid
protein degradation: (ii) trapping of the expressed protein in
intracellular compartments as observed for some proteins
with defective signal peptides for gpi anchor attachment;
(iii) secretion of the expressed protein into the medium; (iv)
rapid clearance from the cell surface due to proteolysis or
serum phospholipase action on a putative gpi-anchored
receptor; and (v) production of a cell surface associated fr
with a poor capacity for binding t3h] xxxd2146xxx , leading to
an apparent low expression.
fate of fr-y expressed in recotnbinunt cho cells. in
order to address the above possibilities, we first established
stably transfected cho cells that gave amplified expression
of fr-y, the gpi-anchored fr-p, and fr-pa in which the
carboxyl-terminal 19 hydrophobic amino acids of fr-p were
deleted. the deletion mutant of fr-p lacks a hydrophobic
carboxyl-terminal signal peptide for gpi anchor attachment
and would therefore be expected to be secreted, since the
constitutive secretory pathway is believed to operate by
default in the absence of protein targeting signals. table 1
summarizes data on the binding of [3h] xxxd2146xxx  on the cell
surface and in the culture media of five cho cell clones
transfected with fr-y together with similar recombinant cells
expressing fr-p and fr-pa. as expected, fr-p was
primarily cell surface anchored while fr-pa was secreted
into the medium. in all of the cho cell clones expressing
fr-y, the [jh]folate binding was detected primarily in the
cell culture media, similar to fr-pa. the time course of
the appearance of [3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding protein in the media
showed a similar pattern for confluent cultures of fr-pa
and fr-y expressing cho cells over a 24-h period, in
contrast to fr-8 (figure l), indicating similar rates of
synthesis and secretion of fr-pa and fk-y.
the levels of fr-pa and fr-y in intermediate intracellular
compartments were also similar (table i). indicating that in

the culture medium used was folate-free rpmi 1640 containing
10% fbs. at the indicated times, aliquots of the media were treated
to remove endogenous folate and assayed for  xxxg807xxx 
as described under materials and methods. the assays were
repeated three times and gave a standard error < 10%. the results
were normalized according to cell number in confluent cultures.

contrast to certain proteins with defective gpi signals (field
et al., 1994), the divergent carboxyl-terminal region of fr-y
did not result in intracellular retention of the protein.
futhermore, estimation of relative mrna levels by northern
blot analysis (figure 2) did not show higher transcript levels
for fr-y compared to fr-pa, suggesting that fr-y is not
synthesized at significantly higher levels than fr-da. these
results indicate that it is unlikely that the fr-y polypeptide
is produced and degraded intracellularly at an extraordinarily
high rate compared to other fr isoforms.
the predicted polypeptide molecular weights of fr-y and
fr-pa are 25 154 and 24 962 da, respectively. both the
polypeptides possess predicted n-linked glycosylation sites
that give rise to diffuse or multiple bands on westem blots
(figure 3). upon deglycosylation with hydrogen fluoride,
both proteins recovered from the recombinant cho cell
culture media gave bands of similar apparent molecular

weights (mr -25 000) on western blots (figure 3). this
result indicates that the occurrence of fr-y in the cell culture
media is not the result of quantitative and selective proteolysis of a large peptide fragment from a putative gpianchored fr-y. from the discussion below, if such a
proteolytic cleavage site exists, it must occur 19-32 amino
acids upstream of the carboxyl terminus, resulting in a
polypeptide that would migrate appreciably faster than frpa by western blot analysis.
when the recombinant cho cells expressing fr-p, frpa, or fr-y were grown briefly in serum-free medium as
described under materials and methods, the results in table
1 were essentially unaltered (results not shown). this
observation rules out the possibility that serum phospholipase
may quantitatively release a putative gpi-anchored fr-y into
the medium.

structural basis for the secretion of fr-y. in order to
understand the physical basis for the secretory nature of fr-y
vs the gpi-anchored fr-a and fr-/3, we inspected the
carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences of the three proteins
which should contain the signal sequence for gpi anchor
attachment (figure 4). the signal for gpi anchor attachment
is typically characterized by an uncharged carboxyl terminal
region of 11-20 amino acids, the site of cleavage/gpi
attachment and a spacer of 8-12 amino acids that separates
the modification site from the relatively hydrophobic sequence (coyne et al., 1993; caras, 1991). the carboxylterminal peptides of the three fr isoforms are unconserved
in contrast to their upstream amino acid sequence. both
fr-a and fr-p contain the structural elements commonly
observed for a gpi signal peptide (figure 4). in fr-y, on
the other hand, the 18 carboxyl-terminal amino acids are
mostly uncharged but are interrupted by charged residues at
positions 2 and 6 from the carboxyl terminus resulting in
the longest contiguous stretch of 12 uncharged amino acids
(figure 4). such a weakly hydrophobic sequence with
charged residues near the carboxyl terminus may still serve
as a gpi modification signal as exemplified by drosophila

1983, and  xxxg149xxx  (millan, 1986). if
this were true for fr-y, the gpi attachment site would extend
into a highly conserved region of fr-y.
in light of the above reasoning, chimeric constructs of
fr-y and fr-p were produced by exchanging the unconserved portions of their carboxyl-tenninal regions (beginning
with histidine in fr-/? and asparagine in fr-y; figure 4).
as seen in table 2, fr-p and fr-y with the fr-/3 carboxyl
terminus were both highly expressed on the cell surface and
were gpi-anchored. in contrast, fr-y and the second
chimera were expressed very poorly on the cell membrane
(table 2); these two proteins were quantitatively recovered
in the cell culture media and bound [3h] xxxd2146xxx  (49.4 and
6.2 pmol, respectively, per lo7 cells). this result clearly
indicates that the secretory nature of fr-y is due to the
divergence of its unconserved carboxyl-terminal peptide,
which cannot serve as an efficient signal for gpi modifica-

tion. unlike other proteins with defective signals for gpi
attachment, that are retained and degraded in intracellular
compartments (field et al., 1994), fr-y is efficiently
secreted, perhaps because of the relative hydrophilicity
conferred by the two charged residues (arginine and aspartic
acid; figure 4) in its carboxyl-terminal segment.
afjinities of  xxxd2146xxx  and reduced folate cotnpounds
for fr-y. a major functional difference between fr-a and
fr-/3 is their different affinities for folate compounds and
their opposite stereospecificities (6s and 6r diastereoisomers
for fr-a and fr-p, respectively) for reduced folate coenzymes (wang et al., 1992). because of the relatively low
affinity of fr-/3 for the physiologic circulating 6 s diastereoisomer of p-methyltetrahydrofolate (wang et al., 1992). a
role for this receptor isoform that is expressed in tissues of
nonepithelial origin (ross et al., 1994) in physiologic folate
transport, is suspect. it was therefore of interest to examine
the folate-binding characteristics of the secreted fr-y. table
3 summarizes the affinities of  xxxd2146xxx  and the 6 s and 6r
diastereoisomers of p-methyltetrahydrofolate and pformyltetrahydrofolate for fk-y in terms of their k, values
for the competitive inhibition of binding of [3h] xxxd2146xxx .
in contrast to other fr isoforms, fr-y does not display a
significant stereospecificity for reduced folate coenzymes.
indicating differences in its mode of binding folate compounds. it does, however, display a high affinity for folic
acid (k, = 0.42 x
m) and for the circulating (6s)-pmethyltetrahydrofolate (kl = 2.2 x
m).
cell type specificity of fr-y and fr-y’. the predicted
amino acid sequence of fr-y’ differs from that of fr-y due
to a deletion of 139 amino acid residues resulting in a 104residue amino-terminal polypeptide (shen et al., 1994).
previously, the mrna for either fr-y or fr-y’ (not
distinguished) was detected in normal spleen, thymus, and
bone marrow and in the bone marrow of patients with chronic
myelogenous leukemia (cml), acute myelogenous leukemia
(aml), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (all); a variety
of nonhematopoietic tissues did not express the transcripts
except some carcinoma explants (shen et al., 1994).
in this study, we developed a method for distinguishing
between transcripts for fr-y and fr-y’ by exploiting a
fortuitous restriction site for ddei that is introduced due to
the occurrence of a 2 base pair deletion that results in a
premature stop codon in the cdna for fr-y’, as described
under materials and methods. when total rna from various
tissues was reverse-transcribed and amplified by pcr using
a 32p-labeled upstream oligonucleotide, both fr- y and fry‘ transcripts gave an expected cdna fragment of 7351733
base pairs (figure 5). when digested with ddei, the pcr
product gave an expected 32p-labeled end fragment of 484
base pairs for fr- y and a radioactive 3 16 base pair fragment
for fr-y’ (figure 5 ) . normal spleen, hl60 promyelocytic
leukemia cells, and bone marrow samples of myeloid (cml
and aml)leukemias predominantly expressed fr-y’ (figure
5 and results not shown). among three samples of bone

a good candidate for the sfbp that is observed at very low

levels in normal serum and elevated in folate deficient states
[reviewed in ratnam and freisheim (1990)l. the observed
cell type specificity of expression of the full-length fr-y in
hematopoietic tissues, coupled with its secretory nature, may
render this fr isoform a useful serum marker for certain
malignant subtypes of lymphoid or other cells. further
detailed studies of specificities of expression of fr-y, in
respect to variou s di fferen t i at ion stages i n hem atopoi esi s, are
required in order to identify those malipancies.

for fr-y and fr-y’. total rna from the sources indicated was
reverse-transcribed and amplified using a radiolaheled pcr primer
and electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel as described under
materials and methods. the full-length pcr product representing
fr-y or fr-y’ will be 735 or 733 base pairs, respectively (the small
size difference is undetectable). when the pcr product is digested
with the restriction enzyme d&i. the resulting labeled fragment
sizes will be 484 and 316 base pairs for fr-y and fr-y’,
respectively. the extreme left lane contains a radiolabeled 1 -kb

marrow from b-cell all that were tested, two produced
fr-y and the third all sample showed a relatively greater
proportion of fr-y’ (figure 5). regardless of whether the
latter observation reflects different proportions of leukemic
vs normal cells in the all bone marrow samples or
variations in leukemic subtypes, the results clearly indicate
that the expression of the secreted full-length fr-y is
restricted to certain hematopoietic cell types.
fr- y in physiologic and cliiiiccrl perspectiw. a soluble
high-affinity folate-binding protein (sfbp) has been identified
in the culture media of cells (e.g., kb cells) expressing high
levels of the membrane-anchored fr and in certain biological
fluids, le., milk (svendsen et al., 1982). umbilical cord serum
(kamen & caston, 1975). and the serum of folate-deficient
individuals (waxman & schreiber, 1973). an obvious
function of sfbp in vivo is to ensure the stability and
bioavailability of (6s)-/v-methyltetrahydrofolate(tani &
iwai, 1984). it has been shown in cell cultures that the
predominantly membrane-anchored fr is the precursor of a
relatively small proportion of sfbp, which is produced either
by proteolysis (antony et al., 1989; elwood et al., 1991;
verma et al., 1992) or due to the action of serum phospholipase (luhrs & slomiany, 1989; verma et al., 1992). the
milk sfbp corresponds to fr-a in the receptor-rich mammary epithelium. however, the origin of sfbp in vivo in
serum is unknown. fr-y, which is quantitatively secreted
and has a high affinity for the circulating form of folate, is
