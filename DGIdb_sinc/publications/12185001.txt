10.1152/ajpregu.00116.2002.—m3 muscarinic receptors mediate cholinergic-induced contraction in most smooth muscles. however, in the denervated rat bladder, m2 receptors
participate in contraction because m3-selective antagonists
[ para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx  ( p-f-hhsid) and
4-damp] have low affinities. however, the affinity of the
m2-selective antagonist methoctramine in the denervated
bladder is consistent with  xxxg449xxx  mediating contraction.
it is possible that two pathways interact to mediate contraction: one mediated by the  xxxg448xxx  and one by the m3
receptor. to determine whether an interaction exists, the
inhibitory potencies of combinations of methoctramine and
p-f-hhsid for reversing cholinergic contractions were measured. in normal bladders, all combinations gave additive
effects. in denervated bladders, synergistic effects were seen
with the 10:1 and 1:1 (methoctramine:p-f-hhsid wt/wt)
combinations. after application of the sarcoplasmic reticulum atpase inhibitor thapsigargin to normal tissue, the 10:1
and 1:1 ratios became synergistic, mimicking denervated
tissue. thus in normal bladders both m2 and m3 receptors
can induce contraction. in the denervated bladder, the m2
and the m3 receptors interact in a facilitatory manner to
mediate contraction.

pharmacological data,

based on the actions of subtypeselective antimuscarinic agents, can distinguish four
subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (m1 –
m4). molecular techniques have identified five muscarinic receptor subtypes (m1 –m5) arising from five separate genes (6). both m2 and  xxxg449xxx 
subtypes are found in most smooth muscles. the m2
receptor preferentially couples to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase through the gi family of proteins, while
the  xxxg449xxx  preferentially couples to inositol
triphosphate (ip3) generation and calcium mobilization
through the gq family of proteins (6). pertussis toxin
(ptx), which adp ribosylates and therefore inactivates the gi family of proteins, has no apparent effect
on contraction (14). even though the m2 muscarinic

receptor density is greater than the  xxxg449xxx  density in bladder and other smooth muscles, the affinity
of subtype-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist
drugs indicates that contraction is mediated by the m3
receptor in most smooth muscles under normal conditions.
a number of studies have shown that under certain
conditions the  xxxg448xxx  subtype can contribute to
the contractile response. this includes selective alkylation of m3 receptors in an environment of increased
intracellular levels of camp in the rat urinary bladder
(5, 11), guinea pig ileum (8), and trachea (19) or after
alkylation without having to raise intracellular camp
levels in other tissues such as the guinea pig gallbladder (2) and colon (13). other studies of smooth muscle
contraction after experimentally induced pathologies,
for example in a cat model of experimentally induced
esophagitis (16), in the denervated rat bladder (3), and
in a model of acute cholecystitis in the guinea pig
gallbladder (2), also suggest that the  xxxg448xxx  participates in mediation of contraction. in addition, in
otherwise normal tissues, the  xxxg448xxx  appears to
mediate contraction after inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium atpase, gq (16), phosphatidylinositol (pi)-specific phospholipase c (pi-plc), phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase c (pc-plc), or
protein kinase c (pkc; ref. 4). treatment with
4-damp mustard causes a greater decrease in muscarinic agonist affinity for stimulating contraction in
guinea pig colon from animals exposed to ptx for 3
days than in non-ptx-treated animals. however,
4-damp mustard is equally effective in decreasing
agonist affinity for stimulating pi turnover in ptxtreated animals compared with normal animals. this
suggests that signal transduction mechanisms unrelated to pi turnover such as those activated by the m2
subtype participate in the contractile response (14).
taken together, these findings suggest that the m2 and
m3 receptors, through different second messenger
pathways, interact to result in smooth muscle contraction.

administered together, the combination may produce

muscarinic receptors interact in bladder contraction

effects that are significantly greater (superadditive or
synergistic) or less (subadditive) than the simple additive effects calculated from the individual drug potencies. one explanation for a departure from additivity is
an interaction between the drug targets involved in the
response. to determine whether an interaction exists
between the m2 and  xxxg449xxx  subtypes in normal
urinary bladder tissue, the inhibitory potencies of combinations of methoctramine (m2-selective antagonist)
and para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx  ( p-f-hhsid; m3-selective antagonist) for reversing carbacholinduced contractions by competitive antagonism (inhibition) were measured. similar experiments using
3-day denervated rat bladder tissue were performed for
comparison. using the inhibitory potency of each drug
alone, the theoretical additive potency of each combination of methoctramine and p-f-hhsid (i.e., 10:1,
1:1, and 1:10 wt:wt of methoctramine to p-f-hhsid)
was determined. comparison of the actual inhibitory
potencies of these drug combinations with those predicted from simple additivity allowed identification of
certain antagonist combinations with inhibitory potencies that were significantly different from those predicted by simple additivity. these comparisons were
made using both normal and denervated rat bladder.
because sohn et al. (16) have shown that treatment of
lower esophageal sphincter smooth muscle cells with
thapsigargin (sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium atpase
inhibitor) alters the contractile mechanism such that
the m2 muscarinic receptor is involved in mediation of
contraction, these comparisons were also made in normal bladder exposed to thapsigargin. revealing an
interaction between the second messenger systems activated by the m2 and  xxxg449xxx  subtypes resulting
in smooth muscle contraction may allow for the development of superior drugs for the treatment of overactive bladder or urinary incontinence and may help
explain the clinical efficacy of the currently available
antimuscarinic agents for the treatment of overactive
bladder.
methods

materials. the following drugs or chemicals were obtained
from the sources indicated: carbachol and thapsigargin were
from sigma chemical (st. louis, mo), and methoctramine
and p-f-hhsid were from research biochemicals international (natick, ma).
surgery. rats (200 to 250-g female sprague-dawley rats
from ace animals, boyertown, pa) were anesthetized with
2% isoflurane in oxygen, and a midline incision was made in
the lower abdomen. the pelvic plexus was exposed. for
bilateral denervation, both the left and right major pelvic
ganglion were electrocauterized with a valleylab (boulder,
co) hand stitching pencil attached to a model sse 2 solidstate electrosurgery device (valleylab). for sham-operated
animals, the plexus was exposed but left intact. after surgery, because the denervated animals were unable to micturate, urine was expressed by manual pressure on the lower
abdomen of the denervated and sham-operated animals twice
daily for 3 days.
muscle strips. urinary bladders were removed from rats
euthanized by decapitation. the urinary bladder body (tissue
ajp-regul integr comp physiol • vol

above the ureteral orifices) was dissected free of the serosa
and surrounding fat; the epithelium was left in place. the
bladder was divided in the midsagittal plane, then cut into
longitudinal smooth muscle strips (approximately 4 ⫻ 10
mm). the muscle strips were then suspended with 1 g of
tension in tissue baths containing 15 ml of modified tyrode
solution (in mm: 125 nacl, 2.7 kcl, 0.4 nah2po4, 1.8 cacl2,
0.5 mgcl2, 23.8 nahco3, and 5.6 glucose) and equilibrated
with 95% o2-5% co2 at 37oc. the muscle strips were tested
for their ability to contract in response to electric field stimulation of 8 v, 30 hz, and 1-ms duration. to determine
cross-sectional area, at the conclusion of the experiment, we
measured the length and weight of each muscle strip between the suspension clips. cross-sectional area was determined by weight/length, which assumes a density of 1.0 for
all muscle strips.
inhibition of carbachol response. after equilibration of the
muscle strips to the bath solution for 60 min, 10 ␮m carbachol (⬃10 times greater than the measured ec50 value) was
added to each bath. once a stable baseline was reached (⬃10
min), increasing concentrations of antagonist or combinations of antagonist were added every 5 min. for meaningful
display of drug combinations, all combinations of antagonists
are expressed as weight/weight ratios of methoctramine:p-fhhsid. for example, an 11 ␮g/ml concentration of a 10:1
combination contains 10 ␮g/ml of methoctramine and 1 ␮g/ml
of p-f-hhsid, resulting in a molar ratio of 5.2 mol of methoctramine per 1 mol of p-f-hhsid. every experiment contained time control strips where tyrode solution was added
in place of antagonist. the data are presented as the percent
contraction at each antagonist concentration normalized to
the contraction  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m carbachol for 6–10 muscle strips per
condition. during the course of the experiment, the tension in
the time control strips gradually declined. as a result, the
data were normalized by the percent decline of the time
control strips such that the contractile response of the control
strips always equaled 100% contraction.
calculation of potency for inhibition levels. the potency of
methoctramine, p-f-hhsid, and the combinations for the
different inhibitory levels was calculated as described by
tallarida (18). briefly, these potencies were determined using nonlinear regression of the individual dose-effect curves.
the predicted inhibitory potency of the combination is based
on the inhibitory potencies of the individual antagonists,
expressed as doses a and b, and the combination doses a and
b, which together produce the same effect (50% inhibition of
contraction) as dose a alone or dose b alone. an additive
interaction relates these as a/a ⫹ b/b ⫽ 1, while superadditivity and subadditivity lead to the fraction sums being less
than or greater than one, respectively. in other words, a
subadditive action is one that requires greater doses (a, b),
whereas a superadditive action requires lower doses (a, b) to
get the same degree of inhibition (50%). for example, in
normal animals the ic50 for methoctramine was 4.57 ␮g/ml
and the ic50 for p-f-hhsid was 0.29 ␮g/ml. following simple additivity, a combination of these two compounds that
contains one-half the ic50 of methoctramine (2.28 ␮g/ml) and
one-half the ic50 of p-f-hhsid (0.15 ␮g/ml) would be expected to inhibit 50% of contraction. if this combination
produces significantly less than 50% inhibition, then this
combination is subadditive. conversely, if this combination
produces significantly greater than 50% inhibition, this combination is synergistic. significance between actual and predicted ic50 values was determined by the student’s t-test
with significance level p ⬍ 0.05.

results

denervated bladders weighed significantly more
(p ⬍ 0.05) than sham-operated bladders (240 ⫾ 15 vs.
96 ⫾ 3 mg). however, muscle strips from denervated
bladders contracted significantly less (p ⬍ 0.05) to
electric field stimulation (8 v, 30 hz, 1 ms) than control
strips (3.7 ⫾ 0.4 and 18.9 ⫾ 1.5 mn/mm2, respectively).
no differences in the maximal carbachol contraction
were seen (sham operated, 33.9 ⫾ 2.9 mn/mm2; denervated, 28.2 ⫾ 2.2 mn/mm2). there were no significant
differences in the contractile responses between normal bladders and bladders from sham-operated controls (data not shown); therefore, the data for normal
and sham-operated controls were pooled (normal). as
seen in fig. 1, the addition of each of these muscarinic
antagonists reversed the carbachol (10 ␮m)-induced
contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. as
shown in fig. 2a, in normal rat bladder muscle strips,
p-f-hhsid (ic50 0.75 ␮m or 0.29 ␮g/ml) was just over
eight times more potent in reversing contraction than
methoctramine (ic50 6.2 ␮m or 4.57 ␮g/ml). however,
in muscle strips from denervated urinary bladders
(fig. 2b), p-f-hhsid (ic50 4.3 ␮m or 1.67 ␮g/ml) was
only two times more potent in reversing contraction
than methoctramine (ic50 8.8 ␮m or 6.51 ␮g/ml). these
results are consistent with our previous study showing
that the affinity of p-f-hhsid for inhibiting contraction decreased after denervation (3). addition of 1 ␮m
thapsigargin to normal tissue had no effect on the
maximal carbachol-induced contraction (43.7 ⫾ 7.4
mn/mm2 for thapsigargin treated vs. 44.4 ⫾ 4.8 mn/
mm2 for normal) or the potency of carbachol for inducing contraction (ec50 ⫽ 2.25 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m for thapsigargin
treated vs. 2.10 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m for normal). however, thapsigargin treatment increased the ic50 for methoctramine approximately twofold, from 4.57 ␮g/ml in normal to 9.7 ␮g/ml (13.3 ␮m). the ic50 for p-f-hhsid
increased more than fivefold, from 0.29 ␮g/ml in normal to 1.58 ␮g/ml (4.1 ␮m).
based on the individual inhibitory potencies of these
antagonists, theoretical additive potencies for 50% inhibition of contraction for the three fixed-ratio combinations of methoctramine:p-f-hhsid (10:1, 1:1, and
1:10 wt/wt) were calculated. the character of the interaction is most easily seen by comparing the actual and
calculated doses based on simple additivity (fig. 2). if
the actual combination dose is lower than the calculated additive dose, then there is superadditivity (synergism); if it is higher, then there is subadditivity. in
bladder strips from normal animals, all combinations
were additive. the results from denervated animals
were quite different. the 10:1 and 1:1 combinations
were synergistic while the 1:10 combination was additive. likewise, in bladder strips from normal animals
treated with 1 ␮m thapsigargin, both the 10:1 and the
1:1 combinations were superadditive, while the 1:10
combination was additive, thus appearing more similar to the denervated preparation than the normal
preparation.

additivity of two antagonists implies independence,

amount that is calculated from their relative inhibitory
potencies. a finding of subadditivity is consistent with
a mechanism in which the two antagonists inhibit two

attenuate each other. alternatively, a finding of subadditivity could also be seen with two compounds that
compete for a common receptor. conversely, a finding
of superadditivity is consistent with the two antagonists inhibiting two pathways that inhibit each other.
in the normal rat bladder, the finding that all combinations of the two antagonists displayed simple additivity suggests that the contractile pathways activated
by the m2 and  xxxg449xxx  subtypes appear to be
functioning independently and that the two antagonists are sufficiently selective such that competition for
the same receptor subtype (subadditivity) is not seen
under these conditions.
evidence for the existence of an interaction between
the signal transduction pathways activated by the m2
and the  xxxg449xxx  subtypes is seen with normal rat
bladder strips in the presence of thapsigargin. thapsigargin treatment had no effect on the maximal carbachol-induced contraction or the potency of carbachol for
inducing contraction. however, thapsigargin treatment altered the mechanism of contraction such that
the 10:1 and the 1:1 combinations of methoctramine:pf-hhsid that were additive in normal (fig. 2a) became superadditive after treatment (fig. 2c), a change
similar to the effects of denervation. we performed
immunoprecipitation assays to confirm that thapsigargin exposure for 30 min did not change the density of
muscarinic receptor subtypes, unlike denervation,
where the density of m2 receptors increased and the
density of m3 receptors decreased (3, 4). thus, at least
for this pharmacological manipulation (in vitro thapsigargin exposure), the change in the mechanism of
smooth muscle contraction mediated by m2 and m3
muscarinic receptors is not related to changes in receptor densities. the results of this series of experiments
support the hypothesis that two interacting contractile
mechanisms exist in normal tissue, one mediated by
the  xxxg448xxx  subtype and the other mediated by the
 xxxg449xxx  subtype, which may interact through calcium mobilization. while the interaction of the contracajp-regul integr comp physiol • vol

tile pathways activated by the m2 and the  xxxg449xxx 
subtypes is apparently masked in normal tissue, treatment with thapsigargin reveals the interaction. these
results provide functional evidence that both the m2
and the  xxxg449xxx  subtypes are found on smooth
muscle cells and mediate contraction.
m2 receptors are traditionally thought to preferentially couple to ptx-sensitive g proteins such as the gi
subfamily, resulting in inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.
an m2-mediated contractile response in bladder muscle can be demonstrated after the majority of m3 receptors are inactivated in an environment of increased
intracellular camp, such as during stimulation with a
␤-adrenergic agonist (5, 11). this pathway has been
proposed to mediate contraction indirectly, merely by
blocking ␤-adrenergic agonist-induced relaxation via
increased camp (7). however, m2 receptors acting
through gi may also stimulate bladder contraction
directly via pkc activation (17). as found in the cat
lower esophageal sphincter, a low degree of muscarinic
stimulation, and consequently a low degree of calcium
mobilization, results in activation of pkc, whereas
pkc activation is inhibited at higher intracellular calcium concentrations (15). thus, in the face of normal
calcium mobilization mediated by the  xxxg449xxx  subtype, the signal transduction pathway mediated by the
m2 subtype may be inhibited. this may explain the
finding that in the presence of thapsigargin, which
interferes with calcium signaling, the signal transduction pathways activated by the m2 and the  xxxg449xxx 
subtype interact in a facilitatory manner to induce
contraction.
the denervated preparation gave results markedly
different from normal tissue. here the combinations
with the highest proportion of the m2-selective antagonist methoctramine (fig. 2b) showed a synergistic
inhibitory effect that reverted to simple additivity
when its proportion in the mixture was reduced to
one-tenth that of the m3-selective antagonist p-f-hhsid. these results in the denervated preparation sup283 • september 2002 •

muscarinic receptors interact in bladder contraction

port an interaction between subtypes in the model
reported by sawyer and ehlert (14), which predicts
that the m2 and  xxxg449xxx  subtypes interact in a
facilitatory manner to mediate contraction of the
guinea pig colon. however, our results in the normal
rat bladder do not support a facilitatory interaction
between muscarinic receptor subtypes for inducing
contraction. only after either denervation or thapsigargin treatment does this interaction become facilitatory. it is possible that the interaction between subtypes is different in the guinea pig colon, or that after
3 days of in vivo ptx treatment, the interaction between subtypes becomes altered. denervation results
in a twofold increase in the density of m2 receptors
while the density of m3 receptors decreases ⬃50% (3,
4). it is possible that the alteration in the mechanism of
contraction in the denervated preparation is related to
changes in receptor density.
does the m3 pathway inhibit the m2 pathway; does
the m2 pathway inhibit the m3 pathway; or do both
pathways inhibit each other? synergistic analysis as
performed in this study does not distinguish between
these scenarios. however, some insight may be derived
from the experiments with normal rat bladder in the
presence of thapsigargin. in the presence of thapsigargin, the interaction of the subtypes not only becomes
superadditive, but subtype-selective antagonist affinities suggest that the  xxxg448xxx  subtype is involved in
mediation of contraction (4). our interpretation is that
thapsigargin inhibits some component of the m3 contractile pathway, and consequently the m2 pathway is
not inhibited and thus mediates contraction. if activation of the m2 pathway inhibited the m3 pathway to a
significant extent, one would predict that the m2 pathway would mediate contraction after selective alkylation of  xxxg449xxx  subtypes. however, when the majority of the  xxxg449xxx  subtypes in the rat bladder are
inactivated by alkylation, and intracellular camp is
not elevated, antagonist affinities remain consistent
with  xxxg449xxx -mediated contraction, suggesting
that relatively low levels of  xxxg449xxx  activation are
sufficient to inhibit the m2-mediated response. consequently, the data presented here for normal tissue
without thapsigargin suggest that no interaction between subtypes or their signal transduction systems
exists. when analyzed in context with the results of the
denervated and thapsigargin-treated tissue, we speculate that in normal bladder smooth muscle, the m3
contractile pathway inhibits the m2 contractile pathway such that only the m3 pathway is evoked.
a possible explanation for why the antagonists in
combination did not show subadditive effects in normal
tissue is because these experiments were performed
with prestimulation of muscarinic receptors, which
raised intracellular calcium and thus inactivated the
m2 pathway before the addition of the antagonists.
because these antagonists are only ⬃10-fold selective,
it may not be possible to lower intracellular calcium
enough to allow reactivation of the m2 pathway without also inhibiting it at the receptor level. our previous
receptor inactivation studies with 4-damp-mustard
ajp-regul integr comp physiol • vol

 xxxd2835xxx 

alkylation in normal tissue demonstrated that very low
levels of the  xxxg449xxx  subtype are sufficient to
mediate contraction (5). this suggests that virtually all
 xxxg449xxx  activation must be blocked in normal tissue, or a component of the signal transduction pathway
mediated by the  xxxg449xxx  subtype must be blocked
with an inhibitor such as thapsigargin, to reveal the
contractile pathway activated by the  xxxg448xxx  subtype.
it is possible that inhibition of the m2 pathway by
the m3 pathway in normal bladders is the result of one
subtype inducing the release of a relaxant factor and
that after denervation or thapsigargin treatment, the
release of this factor is blocked and once blocked, the
m2 and  xxxg449xxx  subtypes cooperate in a positive
manner to result in contraction. however, if one subtype mediates the release of a relaxant factor, while the
other subtype induces smooth muscle contraction, then
as the antagonist inhibits the release of this inhibitory
factor an increase in the magnitude of contraction
would be expected. our data (collected with the epithelium in place) are not consistent with this scenario,
since no increase in the magnitude of contraction with
any doses of antagonist or antagonist combinations
occurred either in normal, thapsigargin-treated, or denervated bladders. in the rat urinary bladder, no
urothelial relaxant factor has been identified; however,
this has been shown in the pig bladder (10). however,
fovaeus et al. (9) describe a relaxant factor derived
from rat bladder that is not of epithelial origin.
the above results support the existence of two independent contractile pathways in normal bladder
smooth muscle, and the interaction between these
pathways changes significantly after denervation or
inhibition of calcium mobilization. in the denervated
rat bladder, the finding of a superadditive inhibition
with the combinations suggests that the m2 and m3
receptors (or the second messenger systems activated)
interact in a facilitatory manner to mediate contraction. therefore, after denervation, the contractile pathways activated in response to muscarinic stimulation
change from inhibitory to facilitatory. this finding, if
confirmed in human bladder, has important implications regarding the design of antimuscarinic agents for
urologic use and may help explain the clinical efficacy
of the non-subtype-selective antimuscarinic drug
 xxxd3398xxx  (12) recently approved by the food and
drug administration for treatment of an overactive
bladder. this is based on the recently proposed concept
that bladder overactivity results from varying degrees
of functional or actual motoneuron denervation of the
detrusor (1). our application of synergistic analysis to
antagonist inhibition, usually used in agonist combination analysis, has provided strong quantitative evidence for the joint roles of both m2 and m3 muscarinic
receptor subtypes in smooth muscle contraction.
