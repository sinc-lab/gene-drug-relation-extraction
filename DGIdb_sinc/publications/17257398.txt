abstract
background: the rapid desensitization of the human prostacyclin (ip) in response to agonist
binding has been shown in cell culture. phosphorylation of the  xxxg1879xxx  by protein kinase c
(pkc) has been suggested to be involved in this process.
methods and results: in this study we investigated the vasodilatory effects of  xxxd2331xxx , a stable
prostacyclin analogue, in perfused rabbit lungs. continuous infusion of the thromboxane mimetic
u46619 was employed to establish stable pulmonary hypertension. a complete loss of the
vasodilatory response to  xxxd2331xxx  was observed in experiments with continuous  xxxd2331xxx  perfusion,
maintaining the intravascular concentration of this prostanoid over a 180 min period. when lungs
under chronic  xxxd2331xxx  infusion were acutely challenged with inhaled  xxxd2331xxx , a corresponding
complete loss of vasoreactivity was observed. this desensitization was not dependent on
upregulation of camp-specific phosphodiesterases or changes in adenylate cyclase activity, as
suggested by unaltered dose-response curves to agents directly affecting these enzymes.
application of a  xxxd124xxx  receptor antagonist 6-isopropoxy-9-oxoxanthene-2-carboxylic
acid (ah 6809) or the pkc inhibitor  xxxd2195xxx  i (bim) enhanced the vasodilatory
response to infused  xxxd2331xxx  and partially prevented tachyphylaxis.
conclusion: a three-hour infusion of  xxxd2331xxx  in pulmonary hypertensive rabbit lungs results in
complete loss of the lung vasodilatory response to this prostanoid. this rapid desensitization is
apparently not linked to changes in adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activation, but may
involve pkc function and co-stimulation of the  xxxg1872xxx  in addition to the  xxxg1879xxx  by this
prostacyclin analogue.

background
prostacyclin (pgi2) is the major product of cyclooxygenases (cox) in the vascular endothelium and mediates
potent anti-platelet, vasodilator, and anti-inflammatory
actions by a  xxxg1879xxx  (ip) [1]. this receptor is
a member of the g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr)
superfamily and is coupled to adenylate cyclase (ac) and
phospholipase c (plc) [2-4]. the prostanoid receptors
are classified into dp, ip, ep (ep 1–4), fp and tp receptors
[5-7] with different affinities for agonists and different
roles in signal transduction. the ip,  xxxg1873xxx ,  xxxg1875xxx  and dp
receptors are coupled to stimulation of adenylate cyclase,
while the tp, ep1 and fp receptors are coupled to ca2+
mobilization. the  xxxg1874xxx  is an alternative spliced
gene, with at least 8 isoforms identified so far. depending
on the subtype, this receptor can be negatively or positively coupled to gs [8,9]. agonist (pgi2 or pgi2 mimetics
such as cicaprost,  xxxd2331xxx , carbacyclin, and prostaglandin
e1)-binding to the  xxxg1879xxx  leads to activation of  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) by  xxxd1773xxx 
(camp) [10]. although, the above mentioned agonist specificities for ip receptors vary and none of them were
highly selective for ip receptors alone. the affinity of cicaprost for human ip receptors is merely 3-fold higher than
for the  xxxd1903xxx   xxxg1875xxx  subtype of receptor, which
also couples to gs [11], and only 17-fold higher than for
the  xxxg1874xxx  in the mouse [12].  xxxd2331xxx  is equipotent
at both human and mouse ip and ep1 receptors, and carbacyclin and  xxxd124xxx  show even greater affinity
for ep3 than for ip receptors [11,12].
disturbances to pgi2 synthesis [13,14], as well as polymorphisms of the pgi2-synthase ( xxxg1880xxx ) [15], have been
linked to severe pulmonary hypertension. substitution of
pgi2, either by overexpression of the  xxxg1880xxx  [16] in an
experimental model or by application of pgi2 [17,18] or
its analogues  xxxd2331xxx  [19,20] or  xxxd319xxx  [21,22] in
patients decreases pulmonary artery pressure. however,
tolerance of the lung vasodilatory response to continuously infused pgi2 rapidly develops in patients with
severe pulmonary hypertension, and dose adjustments
have to be made [17,23]. in copd patients with pulmonary hypertension, the pulmonary vasodilatory response
to continuously infused pgi2 was found to dissipate
within 24 h [24]. marked tolerance to the anti-mitogenic
actions of pgi2 developed within 24 h in coronary artery
smooth muscle cells [25]. basic studies demonstrated that
desensitization of the  xxxg1879xxx  occurs within minutes
after exposure to agonists and is due to agonist-induced
receptor phosphorylation, mainly mediated by pkc [26],
with subsequent sequestration of the intact receptor and
removal from the cell surface [26,27]. in addition, there is
evidence for changes in adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase (pde) activation occurring in response to ip
receptor stimulation, which may contribute to loss of the

http://respiratory-research.com/content/8/1/4

vasodilatory response to pgi2 and its analogues [28-30].
in the present study, we employed the model of pulmonary hypertensive perfused rabbit lungs to investigate the
dose-response relationship and features of tolerance
development upon continuous  xxxd2331xxx  infusion in the
intact lung vasculature.

materials and methods
materials
sterile krebs-henseleit buffer (khb) was obtained from
serag-wiessner (naila, germany). the thromboxane-a2
mimetic u46619 was supplied by paesel-lorei (frankfurt,
germany) and  xxxd2331xxx  by schering (berlin, germany). all
other chemicals were purchased from merck (darmstadt,
germany).
isolated lung model
the perfused rabbit lung model has previously been
described in detail [31]. briefly, rabbits of either sex
weighing 2.6 to 2.9 kg were anticoagulated with heparin
(1000 u/kg) and anaesthetized with intravenous ketamine/xylazine. tracheostomy was performed and the animals were ventilated with room air. after mid-sternal
thoracotomy, catheters were placed into the pulmonary
artery and the left atrium, and perfusion with khb was
started. for washout of blood, perfusate was initially not
recirculated and the lungs were removed without interruption of ventilation and perfusion. the lungs were
placed in a temperature-equilibrated chamber at 37.5°c,
freely suspended from a force transducer for monitoring
of organ weight. in a recirculating system the flow was
slowly increased to 120 ml/min (total volume 350 ml).
left atrial pressure was set at 2 mmhg in all experiments.
in parallel with onset of artificial perfusion, an air mixture
of 80.5% n2, 15% o2 and 4.5% co2 was used for ventilation. tidal volume (11 ml/kg) and frequency (10 – 13
breaths/min) were adapted to maintain the ph of the
recirculating buffer in the range between 7.35 and 7.37. a
positive end-expiratory pressure of 1 mmhg was used
throughout. the po2 and pco2 values in the post-lung
buffer fluid ranged between 100 and 120 mmhg and 38
and 43 mmhg, respectively. pressures in the pulmonary
artery, the left atrium and the trachea were registered by
means of small diameter tubing threaded into the perfusion catheters and the trachea and connected to pressure
transducers (zero referenced at the hilum). the whole system was heated to 37.5°c.

lungs included in the study had 1) a homogeneous white
appearance with no signs of hemostasis, edema or atelectasis; 2) pulmonary artery and ventilation pressures in
the normal range; and were 3) isogravimetric (lung weight
gain < 0.2 g/h) during an initial steady state period of at
least 45–60 min.

experimental protocols
isolated lung experiments
as described previously [32], a sustained increase of ppa
from ≈6 to ≈24 mmhg was achieved by continuous infusion of the thromboxane-mimetic u46619 with a dose
range of 70–160 pmol·kg-1·min-1. individual titration
was performed. this level of pulmonary hypertension was
then maintained for at least 320 min with variations in
ppa of less than 2 mmhg. the following experimental
groups were employed:

control lungs (n = 4): no interventions were undertaken.
u46619-infused lungs (n = 4): after termination of the
steady state period, u46619 was continuously infused for
320 min to provoke an increase in ppa to ~24 mmhg.
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion (n = 4): u46619 was administered as
described. 20 min after onset of u46619 infusion,  xxxd2331xxx  was applied by a bolus injection of 200 ng, followed
by a continuous infusion of 33 ng/kg/h to achieve stable
buffer concentrations in the range of 350 pg/ml.
intravenous pgi2 application (n = 4): u-46619 was administered as described. 20 min after onset of u-46619 infusion, pgi2 was continuously applied at a dose of 50 ng·
kg-1·min-1 until termination of the experiments.
 xxxd3142xxx  i.v. (n = 4): after adjusting stable pulmonary
hypertension, the pde4 inhibitor  xxxd3142xxx  was applied in
increasing doses (dose range 0.001–10 mum).
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion and  xxxd3142xxx  i.v. (n = 4):  xxxd2331xxx  was
applied by a bolus injection of 200 ng, followed by a continuous infusion of 33 ng/kg/h. 240 min after starting the
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion,  xxxd3142xxx  was applied in increasing
doses (dose range 0.001–10 mum).
motapizone i.v. (n = 4): after adjusting stable pulmonary
hypertension, the  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor motapizone was
applied in increasing doses (dose range 0.01–100 mum).
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion and motapizone i.v. (n = 4):  xxxd2331xxx  was
applied by a bolus injection of 200 ng, followed by a continuous infusion of 33 ng/kg/h. 240 min after starting the
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion, motapizone was applied in increasing
doses (dose range 0.01–100 mum).
 xxxd2331xxx  inhalation (n = 4): when stable pulmonary hypertension was achieved,  xxxd2331xxx  was nebulized (deposited
dose 75 ng) by means of an ultrasonic nebulizer as
described previously [33,34].
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion and  xxxd2331xxx  inhalation (n = 4): u46619 was
continuously infused and  xxxd2331xxx  was applied by a bolus

http://respiratory-research.com/content/8/1/4

injection of 200 ng, followed by a continuous infusion of
33 ng/kg/h. 240 min after starting the  xxxd2331xxx  infusion,
 xxxd2331xxx  was nebulized (deposited dose 75 ng).
 xxxd1742xxx  i.v. (n = 4): after adjusting stable pulmonary
hypertension, the adenylate cyclase stimulator  xxxd1742xxx 
was applied in increasing doses (dose range 10–100 mum).
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion and  xxxd1742xxx  i.v. (n = 4):  xxxd2331xxx  was
applied by a bolus injection of 200 ng, followed by a continuous infusion of 33 ng/kg/h. 240 min after starting the
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion,  xxxd1742xxx  was applied in increasing
doses (dose range 10–100 mum).
 xxxd2195xxx  i (bim) infusion (n = 4): bim (1 mum)
was applied by a bolus injection after stable adjustment of
pulmonary hypertension with u46619. as described previously, stable buffer levels of bim are achieved by a single
application in the setup of isolated perfused rabbit lungs
[35].
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion in presence of bim (n = 4): u46619 was
administered as described. after stable adjustment of pulmonary hypertension, bim (1 mum) was applied by a bolus
injection.  xxxd2331xxx  was bolus injected and infused as
described above.
6-isopropoxy-9-oxoxanthene-2-carboxylic acid (ah 6809)
infusion (n = 4): ah 6809 (3 mum) was applied by a bolus
injection after stable adjustment of pulmonary hypertension with u46619. as described previously, ah6809 demonstrated long acting ep1 blocking activity in fluid
perfused small intestine segments after a single application [36].
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion in presence of ah 6809 (n = 4): u46619 was
administered as described. 45 min after onset of u46619
infusion, ah 6809 (3 mum) was applied as a bolus injection and the bolus injection plus infusion of  xxxd2331xxx  was
started as in the preceding groups.
cell culture
rabbit pulmonary smooth muscle cells (psmc) were prepared as described. primary smc were isolated from rabbit pulmonary artery by carefully preparing <1 mm3
pieces of media, devoid of adventitial tissue as assessed by
microscopic control. the pieces of media were placed into
12-well cell culture plates with 500 mul culture medium.
the isolated pulmonary smooth muscle cells (psmc)
identity was verified by characteristic appearance in
phase-contrast microscopy, indirect immunofluorescent
antibody staining for smooth muscle-specific isoforms of
alpha-actin and myosin (at least 95% of cells stained positive),
and lack of staining for  xxxg2423xxx  and vimentin, indicating that the cultures did not contain significant

numbers of endothelial cells or adventitial fibroblasts
[37]. smooth muscle cells were grown in dulbecco's modified eagle's high glucose medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mug/ml streptomycin and 100
units/ml penicillin.
desensitization assays and camp measurement
smooth muscle cells were grown to 90% confluence in
24-well plates, as previously described. for desensitization assays, cells were treated with  xxxd2331xxx  for the indicated times. then, cells were washed three times with
hbss and preincubated in hbss containing 1 mg/ml bsa,
10 mm hepes (ph 7.3) and 1 mm  xxxd2388xxx  for 10 min at
37°c. afterwards cells were again stimulated with  xxxd2331xxx 
(100 nm) or  xxxd1742xxx  (10 mum) for 10 min and camp
measurements were performed as described below. reactions were stopped by aspiration and addition of ice-cold
96% ethanol. dried samples were overlaid with 300 mul
ria-buffer (150 mm nacl, 8 mm na2hpo4, 2 mm
nah2po4, ph 7.4) and frozen overnight at -80°c. camp
in the supernatant was determined by radioimmunoassay
[steiner et al., 1972]. protein determination was performed according to the method of bradford. cells treated
with vehicle alone (no ligand) or  xxxd1742xxx  (50 mum) were
served as negative and positive controls respectively for
the camp measurement.
data analysis
values are means ± sem. student's t-test was performed
for comparison of two values. for multiple comparisons,
anova was followed by post hoc test (bonferroni/dunn
method). statistical significance was considered at p <
0.05.

results
baseline conditions
after termination of the steady state period, all lungs displayed ppa values in the range between 5 and 7 mmhg.
u46619-elicited pulmonary hypertension
continuous infusion of u46619 provoked an increase in
ppa to 23.4 ± 0.9 mmhg within 25 min, with subsequent
plateau of the pulmonary hypertension. this level of pulmonary hypertension was then maintained for at least
300 min with variations in ppa of less than 2 mmhg. total
weight gain at the end of the experiments was 6.5 ± 2.7 g.
u46619-elicited pulmonary hypertension and infusion of
 xxxd2331xxx  or pgi2
as in the preceding group, u46619 infusion for establishing stable pulmonary hypertension was performed. bolus
injection of 200 ng  xxxd2331xxx  was followed by an infusion
of 33 ng  xxxd2331xxx  per hour. this procedure resulted in a
significant vasodilatory response with ppa values decreasing by a mean of 3.3 mmhg. similarly, the continuous

http://respiratory-research.com/content/8/1/4

infusion of a more selective  xxxg1879xxx  ligand, pgi2 also
resulted in significant vasodilatory responses (fig 1). stable  xxxd2331xxx  buffer concentrations in the range of 350–380
pg/ml were documented over the entire perfusion period.
a slow increase in ppa toward pre-infusion values was
noted to commence after 100–120 min, and 200 min
after beginning of the  xxxd2331xxx  infusion, the vasodilatory
effect was virtually fully lost. the total weight gain of the
lungs was 5.3 ± 3.2 g, and thus did not differ from the
groups with mono u46619 infusion.
dose-effect curves of pde-inhibitors with or without
infusion of  xxxd2331xxx 
as shown in fig. 2a, the intravascular administered  xxxg1695xxx 
inhibitor motapizone (dose range 0.01–100 mum) effected
a dose-dependent reduction of the elevated ppa values in
lungs with u46619-elicited pulmonary hypertension.
there was no shift in the dose response curve when applying identical doses of motapizone 240 min after onset of
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion. similar experiments were performed
with the pde4 inhibitor  xxxd3142xxx , which dose-dependently reduced pulmonary artery pressure in u46619 preconstricted lungs, with identical dose-effect curves in the
absence and presence of  xxxd2331xxx  infusion (fig. 2b). total
weight gain was 5.7 ± 2.9 g and 5.3 ± 1.9 g ( xxxd2331xxx  infusion) in the motapizone treated lungs and 4.6 ± 2.2 g and
5.0 ± 2.6 g ( xxxd2331xxx  infusion) in the  xxxd3142xxx  treated
lungs, respectively.
nebulization of  xxxd2331xxx 
inhalation of aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  (total dose 75 ng
inhaled over 10 min) resulted in a significant reduction of
the u46619-induced pulmonary hypertension, with pap
values decreasing by a mean of 6.3 mmhg (fig. 3). in separate experiments,  xxxd2331xxx  was infused in advance for 240
min, and then nebulization was started. there was virtually no response to inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  after this preceding
 xxxd2331xxx  infusion period. the total weight gain of the lungs
was 6.7 ± 2.9 g at the end of experiments.
dose-effect curves of  xxxd1742xxx 
as shown in fig. 4, the adenylate cyclase activator  xxxd1742xxx  (dose range 10–300 mum) reduced the u46619-elicited
pulmonary hypertension in a dose dependant manner.
after  xxxd2331xxx  infusion for 240 min, an identical dose
response curve was observed. total weight gain was 5.6 ±
2.1 g at the end of the experiments.
infusion of  xxxd2331xxx : effects of bim
as in the preceding groups, u46619 infusion for establishing stable pulmonary hypertension was performed.
subsequently, the pkc inhibitor bim at a dose of 1 mum
was applied alone or in combination with  xxxd2331xxx . in
combination group, after 5 min of bim application, bolus
injection of 200 ng  xxxd2331xxx  was followed by an infusion

discussion
the desensitization of the  xxxg1879xxx  after incubation of
platelets [38,39] or  xxxg1879xxx  overexpressing cells
[26,27,40,41] with pgi2 or its analogues in vitro is a wellknown phenomenon. tolerance development of the lung
vasodilatory response to pgi2 has also been observed in

patients with severe pulmonary hypertension being
chronically treated by intravenous infusion of the prostanoid [23,24]. in the present study we show that such
desensitization occurs within 180 min in perfused rabbit
lungs.
desensitization is not dependant on increased pde activity
phosphodiesterases (pde) are enzymes that hydrolyze
 xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx , the second messengers of
pgi2, and no [42,43]. the characterization of the various
pdes currently known has profited from the employment
of selective pde inhibitors. concerning the lung vasculature, the presence of the pde isoenzymes 1, 3, 4 and 5 in

upregulation in response to intracellular elevation of
camp. it has been shown recently that  xxxd1773xxx  upregulates isoforms of pde4 in airway smooth muscle cells
[45], monocytes [46], endothelial cells [47] and jurkat tcells [48]. in addition, short term activation (phosphorylation) of pde4 via pka was demonstrated by treatment
of cells with  xxxd1742xxx , a stimulator of adenylate cyclase
[49]. furthermore, treatment of rats with 7-oxo-prostacyclin resulted in a significant increase in pde4 activity,
which attenuated the elevation of  xxxd2398xxx -induced
camp levels as well as the contractile force development
in a langedorff-heart preparation [50]. similar results
were obtained for  xxxg1695xxx  which has been shown to be regulated on the level of activity [48] and expression [32] by

increased camp levels. in the current study, we employed
motapizone and  xxxd3142xxx , selective inhibitors of  xxxg1695xxx 
and pde4, respectively and performed dose response
studies on vasodilation in normal and desensitized ( xxxd2331xxx -treated) isolated rabbit lungs. as reported earlier,
these pde inhibitors are potent pulmonary vasodilators
[51] and we found no shift in the dose response curve in
desensitized lungs. thus, there is no evidence of increased
pde activity in  xxxd2331xxx -treated isolated rabbit lungs.
desensitization is not dependant on adenylate cyclase
activity
we employed  xxxd1742xxx  as direct activator of adenylate
cyclase and performed dose response studies on pulmonary vasodilation in isolated rabbit lungs. the response to
 xxxd1742xxx  in the desensitized ( xxxd2331xxx -treated) organs

 xxxd2331xxx  infusion. the decrease in pulmonary artery pressure (deltapap, as decrease of u46619-induced pulmonary hypertension)

remained intact (and seemed to be slightly increased),
indicating no regulation of adenylate cyclase. similar
results were obtained in rats chronically treated with
albuterol in which acetylcholine (ach)-induced bronchoconstriction was reversible by  xxxd1742xxx , but not by
albuterol itself, suggesting that the intracellular site of
desensitization is upstream of adenylate cyclase [27].
moreover, the camp production of  xxxd2331xxx -pretreated
rabbit pulmonary smooth muscle cells in response to  xxxd1742xxx  was also not significantly reduced, except in 24
hours of  xxxd2331xxx -pretreated group (to 75% of control).
this is quite contrary to  xxxd2331xxx  responses, where a significantly reduced camp levels (to 25% of control) was
observed, thereby excluding the down-regulation of ade-

nylate cyclase as a possible reason for reduced camp formation after continuous stimulation of cells with  xxxd2331xxx .
in this context, desensitization of ip receptors by  xxxd2331xxx 
may possibly explained by its direct influence on the
receptor, a mechanism upstream of adenylate cyclases.
this involves rapid receptor phosphorylation, which
results in uncoupling of receptor-g protein interactions
and subsequent receptor internalization. these events
result in a diminished response to agonist [26]. this may
also be due to preferential reduction of domain-bound
pool of the cognate gproteins gsalphal and gsalphas [52].
on the other hand,  xxxd2331xxx  induced vasorelaxation
responses may also be via camp-independent manner.
consistent with the observation, pgi2 analogues  xxxd2331xxx

were shown to activate  xxxg1259xxx  and kir channel and subsequent vasorelaxation through a camp-independent, g(s)protein mediated mechanism in vascular smooth muscle
cells [53,54]. concomitantly in guinea-pig aorta, cyclic
amp-dependent and -independent pathways were
recently proposed to underlie the relaxation induced by
the pgi2 analogues,  xxxd2331xxx  and  xxxd319xxx  [55-57]. in
contrast, in rat tail artery, it is thought that channel phosphorylation by  xxxd1773xxx -dependent pka is responsible
for the  xxxg1259xxx -mediated vascular relaxation due
to  xxxg1879xxx  stimulation by  xxxd2331xxx  [58,59]. this is well
in line with investigations in human fibroblasts, where
cells were challenged at any time point of  xxxd2331xxx  pretreatment with  xxxd1742xxx  and fully maintained their camp
response [30]. in contrast, sobolewski et al., demonstrated in rat pulmonary smooth muscle cells (psmcs)

which were exposed to cicaprost, another pgi2 analogue,
a significant reduction in  xxxd1742xxx -induced camp production [60] as well as a decrease in adenylate cyclase isoform 2 and 5/6 expression after one hour of exposure to
this prostanoid. however, both isoforms were expressed
at control levels when psmcs were incubated for longer
time periods with cicaprost. it is possible that the agonists
employed, as well as species differences are responsible
for these conflicting data.
 xxxd2331xxx  influences the  xxxg1872xxx  in addition to the ip
receptor
it is well known that  xxxd2331xxx , the clinically approved
compound for treatment of thromboangiitis obliterans
[20] and pulmonary arterial hypertension [5], is not
highly selective for the  xxxg1879xxx  but also activates the

ep1receptor which is coupled to gq and signals via ip3
generation and increased intracellular calcium (ca2+)
[61]. to investigate the effects of possible involvement of
the ep1receptor we employed the ep1receptor antagonist
ah 6809 and found a dramatic increase in the efficacy of
intravenous  xxxd2331xxx . in contrary, the ah 6809 application alone had no effect on u46619-induced tension.
thus, the agonistic effects on ep1receptor explain the differences between  xxxd2331xxx  and selective ip agonists in inhibition of smooth muscle cell response [26,40].
pkc inhibition and  xxxg1879xxx  desensitization
there is evidence that the initial desensitization process is
dependent on phosphorylation of the  xxxg1879xxx  by pkc
[41,62]. after phosphorylation, the  xxxg1879xxx  is sequestered to clathrin-coated vesicles and by a dynamindependant process internalized into endosomes [41]. this

receptor sequestration is, unlike desensitization, pkcindependent [27] and a time of approximately 18 h is
needed for a resensitization in human fibroblasts [27,30].
however, several studies including our work employed
inhibitors of pkc ( xxxd2195xxx , bim) and could not or
could only partially prevent receptor desensitization, suggesting a minor role of pkc in the desensitization process.
in conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time in
an intact lung model that the pgi2 analogue  xxxd2331xxx 
caused desensitization of the  xxxg1879xxx  within 2 to 3
hours, resulting in complete loss of responsiveness after
this time period. desensitization was not due to increased
pde activity or loss of adenylate cyclase activity, but may
involve pkc function and co-stimulation of the ep1
receptor in addition to the  xxxg1879xxx  by this pgi2 analogue.
