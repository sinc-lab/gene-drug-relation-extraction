background: exenatide ( xxxd2076xxx ) is an incretin mimetic currently marketed as an antidiabetic agent for patients with type 2
diabetes. in preclinical models, a reduction in body weight has also been shown in low-fat-fed,  xxxg1320xxx -deficient rodents.
objective: to more closely model the polygenic and environmental state of human obesity, we characterized the effect of
exenatide on food intake and body weight in high-fat-fed, normal (those with an intact leptin signaling system) rodents. as
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonism has been found to elicit behaviors associated with visceral illness in rodents, we also
examined the effect of peripheral exenatide on kaolin consumption and locomotor activity.
methods and results: high-fat-fed c57bl/6 mice and sprague–dawley rats were treated with exenatide (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/
day) for 4 weeks via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps. food intake and body weight were assessed weekly. at 4 weeks,
body composition and plasma metabolic profiles were measured. kaolin consumption and locomotor activity were measured in
fasted sprague–dawley rats following a single intraperitoneal injection of exenatide (0.1–10 mg/kg). exenatide treatment in mice
and rats dose-dependently decreased food intake and body weight; significant reductions in body weight gain were observed
throughout treatment  xxxd1891xxx  and 30 mg/kg/day (po0.05). decreased body weight gain was associated with a significant decrease
in fat mass (po0.05) with sparing of lean tissue. plasma cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin were also significantly reduced
(po0.05). exenatide  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg significantly reduced food intake (po0.05) but failed to induce kaolin intake. in general,
locomotor activity was reduced at doses of exenatide that decreased food intake, although a slightly higher dose was required to
produce significant changes in activity.
conclusion: systemic exenatide reduces body weight gain in normal, high-fat-fed rodents, a model that parallels human
genetic variation and food consumption patterns, and may play a role in metabolic pathways mediating food intake.

introduction
exenatide ( xxxd2076xxx ) is a 39-amino-acid peptide originally
isolated from the salivary secretions of the gila monster
lizard (heloderma suspectum).1 it shares approximately 53%
homology with the mammalian incretin glucagon-like
peptide-1 (glp-1), and binds to and activates2 the mammalian receptor for glp-1 cloned from pancreatic b-cells.3
exenatide is encoded by a gene that is distinct from the
lizard ortholog of mammalian glp-1.4 nonetheless, it shares

many of the glucoregulatory actions observed with glp-1
and is termed as ‘incretin mimetic’. unlike glp-1, exenatide
exhibits extended kinetics5 due to resistance to proteolytic
degradation by  xxxg651xxx  ( xxxg651xxx ), and has up
to 3000-fold higher in vivo potency for glucose-lowering
in some animal models.6 agents that activate the glp-1
receptor possess high therapeutic potential for the treatment
of diabetes;7–9 exenatide is a currently marketed antidiabetic
agent that is shown to improve glycemic control in patients
with type 2 diabetes.10–12
glucose-lowering with exenatide, glp-1 and glp-1 analogs has been associated with several mechanisms of action,
the first of which to be identified was an enhancement of
glucose-dependent insulin secretion.13,14 the principal result
of this insulinotropic effect is an acceleration of glucose
disappearance into peripheral tissues. exenatide additionally

limits glucose appearance via glucose-dependent slowing
of gastric emptying15,16 and suppression of inappropriately
elevated postprandial glucagon secretion.15–17 more recently,
exenatide has been found to promote pancreatic b-cell
proliferation and islet cell neogenesis in both animal and
in vitro studies.18,19
in addition to its role in glycemic control, glp-1 is a shortterm regulator of food intake,20–22 an effect mediated via
central glp-1 receptors.22,23 agents with actions similar to
glp-1, particularly those resistant to degradation by  xxxg651xxx ,
may be potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of
obesity.24 exenatide reduces food intake in rodents following
either central25–27 or peripheral18,27–31 administration, and
repeated or chronic exposure reduces body weight.6,18,26–28
recent data from clinical trials have also revealed sustainable
weight loss in exenatide-treated type 2 diabetic subjects.10–12
in preclinical models, body weight reductions with systemic
exenatide treatment have been demonstrated in leptinreceptor-deficient rodents under low-fat dietary conditions,6,18,27,28 and most report single-dose effects. one can
readily postulate that polygenic models of obesity that
mimic human consumption patterns may return a more
physiologic picture of potential clinical utility. we therefore
examined the potential of long-term exenatide treatment
to dose-dependently reduce body weight in high-fat (hf)fed, normal (those with an intact leptin signaling) mice
and rats.
secondarily, one concern for a role of  xxxg899xxx 
agonism in satiety is potential activation of nonhomeostatic central nervous system (cns) pathways, such as those
mediating visceral illness, which could account for
observed decreases in food intake. central  xxxg899xxx 
activation in brain has been associated with preclinical
measures of malaise such as conditioned taste aversion
(cta)21,32–34 and kaolin consumption.34 ingestion of kaolin
(non-nutritive clay) in rodents is commonly used to determine the emetic properties of drugs and can be induced
by a number of known emetic agents like the chemotherapeutic cisplatin.35 we therefore examined the potential of
exenatide to induce kaolin consumption in rats. as
exenatide has also been shown to decrease locomotor
activity,31 we also examined exenatide’s acute effect on
general activity levels in rats. in both models, our goal was
to discern doses at which food intake effects may be
dissociated from potentially adverse actions of exenatide.
some of the data presented herein have appeared in
abstract form.36,37

methods
all experiments were conducted in accordance with the
protocols and guidelines approved by the institutional
animal care committee and the nih guide to the care
and use of laboratory animals. all animals were maintained
on a 12 h light/dark cycle (housed at 22–241c with ambient

humidity levels) with ad libitum access to food and water,
unless otherwise noted.

acute food intake in mice and rats
the acute effect of exenatide on food intake was investigated
in standard chow-fed mice and rats. in the first set of
experiments, subjects were group-housed, overnight-fasted
(16 h) female nih swiss mice (25–30 g, harlan sprague–
dawley, indianapolis, in, usa) maintained on a standard
laboratory chow diet (lm-485 teklad, madison, wi, usa).
one group of mice (five cages/four mice per cage) received
an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle (0.9% saline)
or exenatide (0.06 to 632 mg/kg, injection volume ¼ 200 ml)
and food intake/cage measured 60 min post-injection. in
a second group of mice, exenatide was administered i.p. at a
dose of 2.4 mg/kg (four cages/three mice per cage), and
food intake/cage measured at 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and
360 min.
in a second experiment, the peripheral versus central
actions of exenatide were compared during natural feeding.
male sprague–dawley rats (250–300 g) were surgically implanted with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) cannula in the
lateral ventricle at zivic laboratories (pittsburgh, pa, usa;
from bregma: ap 0.8 mm, ml þ 1.5 mm, dv 4.8 mm).
rats were shipped to amylin, individually housed, and
habituated to the facility and diet for 4 weeks (standard
chow diet lm-485 teklad, madison, wi, usa). on the test
day (weight ¼ 42575 g), food was removed at 1500 hours. at
1700 hours, immediately before the onset of the dark cycle,
animals received an i.c.v. injection (2 ml) of vehicle (0.9%
saline) or exenatide (0.024–24 mg/kg) and food was made
available. following a 3-week washout period, the same rats
were randomly divided into treatment groups and tested
under identical conditions with an i.p. injection (100 ml) of
vehicle or exenatide (0.024–240 mg/kg). food intake following both i.c.v. and i.p. administration was measured 2 h postinjection. verification of cannula placement was made via
histological analysis at the end of the study.

sustained exposure in high-fat-fed mice and rats
subjects were group-housed 4-week-old male c57bl/6j mice
(14 g; jackson laboratory, bar harbor, me, usa) maintained
on an hf diet (58% fat kcal; d12331, research diets,
new brunswick, nj, usa) for 28 days. the c57bl/6j mouse
strain is prone to weight gain under hf dietary conditions.38
at the end of the fattening period, mice were divided into
groups of equal body weight (mean7s.e.m. at time of
implant ¼ 26.571.4 g). under isoflurane anesthesia, animals
were implanted subcutaneously with 28-day osmotic pumps
(#2004, durect corp., cupertino, ca, usa) delivering
vehicle (50% dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) in water) or exenatide (3–30 mg/kg/day, flow rate ¼ 0.25 ml/h). mice remained
on the hf diet for the duration of the study. food intake
and body weight were measured weekly. at 28 days,

overnight-fasted mice (16 h) were killed by cardiac puncture
under isoflurane anesthesia. approximately 800 ml of blood
was collected in eppendorf tubes coated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta). the blood was centrifuged
(1 min, 10 000 r.p.m.), and plasma then frozen in dry ice and
stored (701c). plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol
were determined by standard enzymatic methods adapted
for the cobas mira plasma analyzer (roche diagnostics,
indianapolis, in, usa). plasma insulin was measured with an
ultrasensitive mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay as per the manufacturer’s instructions (catalog number:
08-10-1150-01, alpco diagnostics, salem, nh, usa).
carcasses were frozen with liquid nitrogen, and fat and
protein contents were determined by soxhlet extraction39
and dumas method,40 respectively (covance laboratories,
madison, wi, usa).
in a second experiment, individually housed male
sprague–dawley rats (340 g; harlan, san diego, ca, usa)
were maintained on the hf diet described above for 28 days.
at the end of the fattening period, rats were divided into
groups of equal body weight (mean7s.e.m. at time of
implant ¼ 45474 g). under isoflurane anesthesia, animals
were implanted subcutaneously with 28-day osmotic pumps
(#2ml4, durect corp.) delivering vehicle (50% dmso in
water) or exenatide (3–30 mg/kg/day, flow rate ¼ 2.5 ml/h).
rats remained on the hf diet for the duration of the study.
food intake and body weight were measured weekly. at 28
days, rats were killed by cardiac puncture under isoflurane
anesthesia. approximately 8 ml of blood was collected in
eppendorf tubes coated with edta. the blood was centrifuged (5 min, 10 000 r.p.m.), and plasma then frozen in dry
ice and stored (701c). plasma exenatide concentrations
were determined as described previously.39

kaolin consumption
individually housed male sprague–dawley rats (300 g) consuming a standard laboratory diet (lm-485 teklad, madison,
wi, usa) were introduced to kaolin pellets (#k5001,
research diets, new brunswick, nj, usa), similar in shape
and size to their chow, for 3 days before experimentation.
on day 4, rats were assigned to treatment groups balanced
for chow and kaolin intake. animals were fasted overnight
(16 h, both chow and kaolin removed) on day 5. the
following morning, rats were injected i.p. (1 ml/kg) with
vehicle (10% dmso in water), cisplatin (3 mg/kg) or
exenatide (0.10, 1 or 10 mg/kg). immediately after the
injection, rats were returned to their respective cages
containing a measured quantity of chow and kaolin. kaolin
and chow intakes were determined 24 h following the
injection.
locomotor activity
individually housed sprague–dawley rats (435 g) consuming
a normal chow diet (lm-485 teklad, madison, wi, usa) were
fasted overnight (16 h) and administered a single i.p.
international journal of obesity

injection (1 ml/kg) of vehicle (10% dmso in water) or
exenatide (0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0 and 5 mg/kg) and immediately
placed individually into locomotor activity monitors (smart
frame units, hamilton-kinder, san diego, ca, usa). the
apparatus consists of a bi-level 4  8 photo beam frame that
surrounds a single housing unit. total distance traveled and
rest time were measured for 30 min post-injection. under
identical conditions, a separate group of rats (435 g) were
administered vehicle or exenatide (0.10–5 mg/kg) and food
intake measured 30 min post-injection.

statistical analysis
group differences were assessed using analysis of variance
followed by dunnett’s post hoc comparisons (systat version
10.2). nonlinear regression (sigmoidal dose–response) was
used to examine dose–response and concentration–response
relationships. percent body weight loss (vehicle-corrected)
was calculated as follows: (mean vehicle body weight gain–
peptide body weight gain/initial body weight)  100. the
significance level was set at po0.05. all data are presented as
mean7s.e.m.

results
acute effects on food intake in mice and rats
at 60 min post-injection, i.p. administered exenatide produced a dose-dependent suppression of food intake in fasted
mice (figure 1a). the half-maximal effective dose (ed50)
for food intake suppression was 2.3 mg/kg70.11 log units,
with a maximal suppression of 70%. similar ed50 values were
observed at the 30 and 120 min time points (1.2 and 2.5 mg/
kg, respectively, data not shown). at 2.4 mg/kg (approximate
ed50), exenatide significantly decreased cumulative food
intake compared to vehicle at the 120, 180, 240 and 300 min
time points (figure 1b).
similarly, both i.p. and i.c.v. administration of exenatide
to rats at the onset of the dark cycle dose-dependently
reduced food intake at 2 h post-injection (figure 2). at the
doses tested, the ed50 following i.p. administration was
46.3 mg/kg70.41 log units, with a maximal suppression of
food intake of 75%. the ed50 following i.c.v. injection was
0.37 mg/kg70.17 log units; at the higher doses tested, food
intake was virtually abolished (94% suppression).
effect of sustained exposure on food intake, body weight,
metabolic indicators and body composition in high-fat-fed mice
sustained peripheral exposure of hf-fed mice to exenatide
for 28 days dose-dependently suppressed body weight gain
throughout the treatment period (figure 3a). compared to
vehicle, body weight gain was significantly reduced at the 10
and 30 mg/kg/day doses at all time points. at 28 days, percent
body weight loss was 2.170.7, 9.470.9 and 16.470.9% at 3,
10 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively (ed50 ¼ 19 mg/kg/day7
0.2 log units). concomitant changes in food intake were

observed: compared to vehicle, food intake was significantly
reduced  xxxd1891xxx  and 30 mg/kg/day of exenatide for the first
3 weeks of treatment (figure 3b). this effect remained
statistically significant during week 4 in mice treated with
30 mg/kg/day of exenatide. when food intake was expressed
per kg of body weight, there were no instances of increased
food intake in exenatide-treated mice compared to controls
(all p40.05, data not shown). plasma analysis at termination
(figure 4) revealed significant decreases in exenatide versus
control rats in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels at
the highest dose tested. plasma insulin was significantly
decreased at both 10 and 30 mg/kg/day. body composition
analysis showed a significant reduction in body fat content

effect of sustained exposure on food intake and body weight
in high-fat-fed rats
similar to its effects in hf-fed mice, exenatide dosedependently decreased body weight gain throughout the
treatment period in hf-fed rats (figure 6a). compared to
vehicle, body weight gain was significantly reduced at all
doses throughout the study, with the exception of the 3 mg/
kg/day dose on day 28. at 28 days, percent body weight loss
was 4.372.2, 8.471.2 and 11.771.2% at 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/
day, respectively (ed50 ¼ 6 mg/kg/day70.07 log units). a
dose-dependent and significant reduction in food intake
was observed during the first week of exenatide treatment at
all doses tested (figure 6b). this trend was present during the
second week of treatment, but failed to reach statistical
significance. during weeks 3 and 4, exenatide-treated rats
displayed food intake levels similar to vehicle-treated
rats. when food intake is expressed per kg of body weight,
there was some compensatory eating in exenatide-treated
rats: 30 mg/kg/day of exenatide increased consumption week
3 (vehicle ¼ 1165734 kcal/kg versus 30 mg/kg/day ¼ 13977
40 kcal/kg, po0.05) and at all doses week 4 (vehicle ¼ 107576 kcal/kg versus 3 mg/kg/day ¼ 1188723 kcal/kg,
10 mg/kg/day ¼ 1183729 kcal/kg and 30 mg/kg/day ¼ 12087
22 kcal/kg, po0.05). plasma exenatide concentrations at 28
days reflected an effector concentration for half-maximum
response (ec50) for suppression of weight gain of
14.3 pm70.96 log units (figure 7).

activity in rats treated with exenatide. distance traveled was
decreased and rest time increased compared to controls, with
significant effects first apparent at a dose of 0.50 mg/kg
(figure 9a and b). under identical conditions, decreased food
intake was first discernable at 0.25 mg/kg (figure 9c).

discussion
the current results confirm the ability of exenatide to dosedependently reduce acute food intake in rodents. furthermore, we show for the first time that continuous peripheral

exposure for 28 days to normal (those with an intact leptin
signaling system) hf-fed mice and rats dose-dependently
decreased food intake and body weight gain. these effects
were associated with a decrease in fat mass in the presence of
sparing of lean tissue, and an improved metabolic profile.

in the presence of decreased food intake, exenatide had no
effect on kaolin consumption, a preclinical marker of emesis.
the dose–response relationships for locomotor activity and
food intake were highly correlated with exenatide treatment,
although a higher dose was required to produce statistically
significant changes in activity than to reduce food intake.
acutely, peripherally administered exenatide potently
inhibited 60 min food intake in fasted mice with an ed50
of b2 mg/kg, consistent with previous reports.31 in rats, the
potency of exenatide to reduce food intake following i.p. or
i.c.v. administration is also within the range of those
reported previously.25,27 consistent with a plasma half-life
of 150 min in rats (i.p.),5 the effect of exenatide, at the ed50
dose, was sustained for 5 h post-injection. although dose
dependent, this effect has shown to be durable in normal
mice for 24 h.31
sustained exenatide exposure produced a persistent reduction in body weight in both mice and rats, with a maximal
weight loss at 4 weeks of 16 and 11%, respectively. the
demonstrated action of peripheral exenatide to reduce
weight in monogenic models of obesity6,18,27,28 can now be

extended to normal rats consuming an hf diet. comparing
our findings with those from leptin-receptor-deficient
models, both zdf6 and fa/fa rats18,27,28 show weight reductions of similar magnitude, suggesting that exenatide effects
are mediated via a leptin-independent pathway. exenatide
displayed greater efficacy in mice than rats, as evidenced by
greater weight loss and persistence of reduced food intake
throughout the study. in terms of durability, exenatide’s
weight-lowering effects have been demonstrated for up to 2
years in sprague–dawley, standard chow-fed rats.41 patients
with type 2 diabetes, treated s.c. twice daily with exenatide
(5 or 10 mg), show durable weight loss for up to 82 weeks with
an average weight reduction of 4.7 kg.42 the potency of
exenatide to decrease body weight gain in the current study
(ec50 ¼ 14.3 pm) is comparable to its potency to produce
glucose lowering (estimated ec50 ¼ 25 pm)43 and slow gastric
emptying (estimated ec50 ¼ 25 pm)44 in patients with type 2
diabetes.
consistent with a state of negative balance, exenatide
acutely reduces metabolic rate in rodents.45 the long-term
international journal of obesity

effects of systemic exenatide on energy expenditure have not
been examined. pair-fed fa/fa rats show equivalent weight
reductions as those treated for 6 weeks with exenatide,18
suggesting that a major part of exenatide’s actions can be
attributed to a reduction in food intake. similarly, food
intake is reduced in humans following exenatide46 or glp147 infusion. we also found that weight loss was accompanied by a loss of fat tissue, with a sparing of lean mass. this
is the first report showing a sparing of lean mass with
exenatide treatment in the presence of decreased body
weight and concomitant decreased fat mass. exenatide also
reduced total cholesterol and triglycerides in mice; insulin
concentrations were also reduced, potentially reflecting
an improvement in insulin sensitivity, consistent with
observations in other studies.6,18 consistent with the
improved metabolic profile observed in mice, patients with
type 2 diabetes show improvements in cardiovascular
risk factors with exenatide treatment, including decreased
triglycerides.48
potential nonhomeostatic reductions in food intake with
exenatide were evaluated in the kaolin consumption and
locomotor activity models. exenatide did not elicit kaolin
consumption in the presence of decreased food intake. as a
positive control, cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent that
elicits emesis in humans, decreased food intake and
increased kaolin consumption. reversal of lithium chlorideinduced kaolin ingestion has been observed following i.c.v.
administration of a glp-1 antagonist,34 but this effect may
reflect stimulation of a different population of glp-1
receptors that are not activated following systemic exposure.
both food intake and locomotor activity were dosedependently reduced with acute exenatide treatment in rats,
but were dissociable within a narrow dose range. this
dissociation has also been demonstrated in mice, as 0.06 mg
(b2.4 mg/kg) of i.p. administered exenatide reduced food
intake but had no effect on locomotor activity, or on cta, a
model of visceral illness;31 a higher dose of 3 mg (120 mg/kg)
decreased both food intake and locomotor activity, and
induced cta. it is feasible that additional  xxxg899xxx 
populations are recruited at the higher doses, resulting in
decreased locomotion. although demonstrating dissociation
of food intake and side-effect measures by comparing dose–
response relationships suggests activation of energy pathways, it remains possible that subthreshold doses may still
produce aversive consequences without signs of overt illness.
the biology underling exenatide’s effect on activity, and
its contribution to reducing food intake, is unclear. in the
clinic, a small percentage of exenatide-treated patients
(placebo-corrected) experience emesis (9%), consistent with
our current findings in the kaolin model in rats, whereas a
greater proportion report nausea (38%).10 both events are
mild to moderate in nature, and decrease with continued
treatment. the finding that weight loss in exenatide-treated
patients (10 mg, twice daily) continues for at least 82 weeks in
the absence of continued nausea42 points to a satiety-related
mechanism of exenatide contributing to reduction of body

weight, and not through pathways mediating aversive states.
it should be noted that central activation of glp-1 pathways
in rodents through the i.c.v. route of administration is also
associated with cta.21,32–34 however, site-specific administration of glp-1 in the cns shows this effect to be mediated
by distinct  xxxg899xxx  populations that are separable
from those mediating food intake effects.49,50
in summary, the current data demonstrate for the first
time the ability of peripherally administered exenatide to
reduce body weight gain and improve metabolic profile in
normal rodents consuming an hf diet, a model that parallels
the genetic variability and environmental conditions contributing to human obesity, and supports a role for exenatide
in metabolic pathways mediating food intake and body
weight.
