k+ transport in the caterpillar intestine epithelium: role of osmolytes
for the k+-secretory capacity of the tobacco hornworm midgut

accepted: 6 july 2004 / published online: 20 august 2004
ó springer-verlag 2004

abstract the midgut of the tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta, actively secretes potassium ions. this can be
measured as short-circuit current (isc) with the midgut
mounted in an ussing chamber and superfused with a
high-k+ saline containing as its major osmolyte
166 mm sucrose. iso-osmotic substitution of sucrose by
non-metabolisable compounds (mannitol, urea, nacl
and the polyethylene glycols 200, 400 and 600) led to a
dramatic, though reversible, drop in the current. acarbose, a speciﬁc inhibitor of invertase (sucrase) in vertebrates and insects, had no detectable inﬂuence on isc.
unexpectedly, after replacing sucrose iso-osmotically
with the saccharides glucose, fructose, trehalose or rafﬁnose, the k+ current could no longer be supported.
however, all osmolytes smaller than sucrose (except for
nacl), metabolisable or not, initiated an immediate,
quite uniform but transient, increase in isc by about
20%, before its eventual decline far below the control
value. hypo-osmotic treatment by omission of sucrose
also transiently increased the k+ current. small osmolytes substituted for sucrose caused no transient isc
stimulation when the epithelium had been challenged
before with hypo-osmolarity; however, the eventual decline in isc could not be prevented. our data seem
inconsistent with a role of sucrose as energiser or simple
osmolyte. rather, we discuss here its possible role as
analogous to that of sucrose in lower eukaryotes or
plants, as an extra- and/or intracellular ‘‘compatible
osmolyte’’ that stabilises structure and/or function of the
proteins implicated in k+ transport.

introduction
in the mammalian (weiss et al. 1995; ushijima et al.
1995) and insect intestine (koch and moﬀett 1987;
turunen and crailsheim 1996) ingested sucrose is
enzymatically split into glucose and fructose by invertase
(sucrase). in mammals, the products are immediately
taken up into enterocytes by facilitated and obligatorily
na+-coupled symport of the sugars via the so-called
disaccharidase-related transport system (ushijima et al.
1995). in animals, sucrose is generally regarded to be
membrane-impermeant; for this reason it has been
widely used in insect epithelia as well as a marker of the
extracellular space and also of tight junctional permeability (abramchek et al. 1980; koch and moﬀett 1987).
on the other hand, true sucrose transporters are well
described for plant cell plasma membranes (lalonde
et al. 1999). there, in addition to supporting metabolism, sucrose acts also as a ‘‘compatible’’ intracellular
osmolyte that stabilises protein structures in stress conditions (crowe et al. 1992; potts 1994; becker et al. 1996;
sola-penna et al. 1997), a property shared by mannitol,
taurine, myo-inositol, sorbitol and others (nakanishi
et al. 1988).
lepidopteran larvae feed on leaves, and the ingested
sucrose as a major soluble carbohydrate reappears as the
haemolymph storage carbohydrate trehalose (treherne
1958; chamberlin 1989) in concentrations of more than
50 mm (thompson 1999; thompson and redak 2000;
thompson et al. 2003). while luminal splitting of sucrose by invertase is a generally accepted paradigm, an
intracellular midgut invertase has also been proposed
recently (turunen and crailsheim 1996), suggesting that
at least some insect cell membranes may be permeable to
sucrose.
caterpillars also feed on a diet rich in k+. as a
consequence the haemolymph [k+] can be as high as
30 mm. excess k+ is actively secreted by midgut goblet
cells in a process which can easily be monitored as a
lumen-directed short-circuit current (isc) when sheets of

528

midgut are mounted in an ussing chamber. isc is carried
solely by k+ ions and is, therefore, termed k+ current,
ik (e.g. moﬀett 1979; zeiske et al. 1986; zeiske 1992).
since a na+/k+-atpase is not expressed in this tissue
(jungreis and vaughan 1977), k+ must be pulled from
the haemolymph into the cells via ion channels (zeiske
et al. 1986) against an intracellular k+ activity of more
than 90 mm (moﬀett et al. 1982). the passive driving
force behind this is the cell negativity (moﬀett et al.
1982; chao et al. 1990; moﬀett and koch 1992) established by the apical h+-pumping v-atpase (wieczorek
et al. 1991). apically, k+ is secreted via a k+/2h+
exchanger, which is equally energised using the voltage
built up by the v-atpase in its vicinity, so that the
pumped protons are apically recycled (wieczorek et al.
1991, 2000).
harvey and nedergaard (1964) devised, for the
american silkworm midgut preparation, a ‘‘minimal
ringer’’ containing 32 mm k+ as major cation and
166 mm sucrose (see also methods) serving as an
extracellular osmolyte but also as an energy source
(harvey and nedergaard 1964; harvey et al. 1983).
however, moﬀett (1979) discovered for manduca midgut that k+ secretion was severely (although reversibly)
impaired not only, as expected, when sucrose was replaced with the non-metabolisable mannitol, but also
when glucose or fructose replaced sucrose iso-osmotically. furthermore, other di- or trisaccharides as well as
large non-metabolisable polyethylene glycols in the place
of sucrose seemed to fully sustain k+-secretion. the
marked tissue swelling in the presence of mannitol led to
the conclusion that the resulting dilution of the intracellular transport pool for k+ might be responsible for
the observed impairment of k+ secretion. indeed,
abramcheck et al. (1980) found that radioactively
labelled mannitol completely equilibrated with the tissue
water, but sucrose equilibrated only to 50%. koch and
moﬀett (1987) found an even smaller sucrose space. on
the other hand, it is known that hypo-osmotic cell
swelling in epithelia generally leads to an increase, rather
than a decrease, in ion transport (van driessche and
zeiske 1985; parker 1993) which is also the case in
manduca midgut (zeiske et al. 1990). there the basolateral k+ channels, which are rate-limiting for transepithelial k+ secretion (zeiske et al. 1986, 1990, 1992),
appear to be activated.
based on this background, we re-investigated exactly
what role sucrose might play in the saline. in contrast to
moﬀett (1979), we used m. sexta midgut mounted in an
ussing chamber that could be permanently perfused with
saline under transepithelial voltage-clamp conditions
(zeiske et al. 1986). we ﬁrst studied the eﬀect on k+
current when replacing saline sucrose iso-osmotically
with osmolytes that are presumed to be metabolisable
(glucose, fructose, trehalose, raﬃnose) or are considered
non-metabolisable (nacl, urea, mannitol, polyethylene
glycols 200, 400, 600). we also checked whether the
pharmacological inhibition of a putatively active invertase would impair k+ transport. in addition, we com-

pared the iso-osmotic sucrose substitution with a hypoosmotic situation where sucrose was simply omitted.

materials and methods
insects, tissue mounting and electrical measurements
manduca sexta l. was raised at 27 °c with daily cycles
of 16 h of light. the larvae (tobacco hornworms) were
fed a synthetic diet modiﬁed according to bell and
joachim (1974), and were used in the ﬁfth instar. the
posterior midgut preparation and experimental apparatus were as described previously (e.g. zeiske et al. 1986,
1992; schirmanns and zeiske 1994a, 1994b; zeiske et al.
2002). dissection and mounting were performed in icecold standard saline that contained sucrose as the major
osmolyte. after mounting 0.26 cm2 of the tissue in a
modiﬁed ussing chamber (1.8-ml half-chamber volume),
the appropriate salines (at room temperature) were
continuously superfused at a rate of 4 ml min 1. the
solutions were discarded after chamber perfusion. the
preparation was voltage-clamped, and the short-circuit
current (isc) was registered with a chart recorder. all
currents are given for 1-cm2 nominal tissue area. in the
ﬁgures depicting isc time graphs, we follow the convention of deﬁning basolateral-to-apical cation movements
as negative currents. clamping errors arising from the
comparably low ratio of solution to tissue conductivity
were avoided (see schirmanns and zeiske 1994a, 1994b)
by placing the voltage electrode kcl-agar tips less than
1 mm from the tissue surface.
statistics
due to the inherent 20% h 1 downward drift of ik
(haskell et al. 1965; wolfersberger and giangiacomo
1983; chamberlin 1989), but also due to the comparably
slow alterations (although still much faster than the
drift) during the osmolyte substitution experiments, true
steady states could hardly be obtained, since we
attempted to hold the length of an experiment to no
longer than 1 h, including the test of reversibility.
therefore, when mean values for ik are given, they reﬂect moments in time which might be quite diﬀerent
from true steady states. therefore, mean values indicate
relative, normalised currents, i.e. the current obtained
after a certain exposure time with a test solution divided
by the current obtained with standard, sucrose-containing saline just before an experimental manoeuvre.
this understanding underlies the experimental design of
the data summarised in fig. 1.
salines
as previously, we used as standard saline a solution that
was originally devised by harvey and nedergaard (1964)

529

when other osmolytes were to be tested, sucrose was
substituted iso-osmotically with the desired compound
unless otherwise stated (see end of the introduction). in
order to check the speciﬁcity of the observed eﬀects,
appropriate salines were composed in which the k+
salts were replaced by na+ salts. all chemicals were
obtained from merck or sigma, except for the invertase
inhibitor acarbose, which was obtained as a kind gift
from bayer.

results

is substituted with other osmolytes in the saline

currents (% ik, ±sem) after bilateral and iso-osmotic replacement of saline sucrose with other osmolytes which are believed to
be metabolisable ( xxxg869xxx   xxxg870xxx  glucose, fruc fructose, tre trehalose) or not
(mann mannitol, peg polyethylene glycols 200, 400, 600; nacl).
for data obtained with raﬃnose and urea, see text. 100% ik is
deﬁned as the current just before sucrose replacement (see also
methods and results). the small osmolytes (glucose, fructose,
mannitol, peg 200) ﬁrst stimulate ik (striped bars; current maxima
at about 2 min after sucrose replacement) but then lead to a
marked ik reduction (here shown for 10 min after sucrose
replacement; solid bars) below the control value. only currentdepressive eﬀects were seen when sucrose was substituted with
trehalose, peg 400 and 600 and nacl but also raﬃnose (not
shown here; see text). n equals 5–9 for glucose, 2 for fructose, 3 for
trehalose, 5–7 for mannitol, 5 for peg 200, 2 for peg 400, 3 for
peg 600 and 2 for nacl as sucrose substitutes. mean values±sem for the normalised currents as well as for the average
time±sem of maximum stimulation are further speciﬁed in the
respective text passages. where n=2 (fruc, peg 400, nacl) sem
was not determined. for peg 600 (n=3) a 2-min sem value could
not be determined accurately due to the very fast current drop (see
fig. 6)

for the american silkworm midgut and later also used
by most investigators who studied k+ transport in the
midgut of the tobacco hornworm. this standard or
control saline contained (in mm) 30 kcl, 5 cacl2, 5
mgcl2, 2.5 khco3 and 166 sucrose. the ph was 8.0
when gassed with air. although gassing with 100%
oxygen instead of air can double the recorded currents
(haskell et al. 1965), their drift (see above) can not be
avoided. deviating from the majority of papers in this
ﬁeld, we chose air as the natural oxygen supplier. we
have to take into account, however, that in vitro, neither
gassing the salines with air nor with pure oxygen will be
able to replace the—in vivo—highly eﬀective delivery of
gaseous oxygen to the immediate vicinity of midgut
epithelial cells through the manifoldly branching tracheole system (dow 1992).
the tissue was superfused with control saline (4 ml
min 1, each half of the ussing chamber containing
1.8 ml of solution) until the downward-drifting current
had reached a ‘‘quasi-steady state’’ with a decay of no
more than 20% h–1. this state was usually attained
about 20 min, if not earlier, after midgut mounting.

comparison of metabolisable surrogates for sucrose
(glucose, fructose) with non-metabolisable mannitol
that the in vitro caterpillar midgut k+ secretion
probably does not depend obligatorily on carbohydrates had been suspected by chamberlin (1987) for
feeding m. sexta larvae. furthermore, in starving
caterpillars, biochemical studies led to the conclusion
that lipids (chamberlin 1987), in addition to carbohydrate stores (ziegler 1999), energise the tobacco
hornworm midgut. this underlines even more why the
elucidation of the role of sucrose in the standard saline
that is used for the in vitro assay of k+ transport is of
importance.
we mounted the excised midgut in the ussing
chamber, and k+ secretion was assayed in symmetrical
standard saline as k+-carried, short-circuit current
(isc=ik). before voltage-clamping, the open-circuit
voltages were between 60 and 140 mv, gut lumen side
positive. quasi-steady state control ik values (see
methods) ranged from 120–680 la cm 2.
as demonstrated by moﬀett (1979), the presence of
mannitol instead of sucrose leads, within 20 min, to a
marked loss of the k+ current (see also figs. 1, 2, 3) and
often results in a value close to zero after 1 h (not shown
here). according to moﬀett (1979), working with a timeconsuming draw–reﬁll method for solution exchange
during which no current measurement is possible, the ik
decay with mannitol substituting for sucrose was steady.
however, with our method of constant and fast chamber
perfusion, we were able to monitor ik during the time
period of solution exchange. we were surprised to
observe, right after the solution exchange, an initial
positive current transient before the expected eventual
decline far below the control value in sucrose saline.
figure 4 illustrates such a biphasic current time course
for another case, namely, the iso-osmotic substitution of
saline sucrose with glucose and, subsequently, during
exchange of sucrose with mannitol.

due to our method of continuous tissue superfusion with
saline, enabling us to closely follow the current time

after tissue mounting in sucrose saline, ik showed the
typical, although here quite fast, downward drift but
became relatively stable after 10 min. bilateral replacement of sucrose with glucose, however, did not result in
an immediate drop in ik as we originally expected, based
on moﬀett’s (1979) original observation on sucrose
substitution with mannitol. instead, a marked but only
transient, rise to a new current maximum that was
approximately 50% higher than with sucrose as control
could be seen at about 4 min after the solution exchange. only then did the expected decay of k+ current
start, attaining the magnitude of the previous control
current after another 10 min and then falling steadily to
a low value. the current recovered quickly after reintroduction of sucrose.
in the paper by moﬀett (1979), a time course of ik for
sucrose replacement with mannitol was shown but not
with glucose as surrogate. an initial interruption of the
current trace for at least 4 min was documented during
the time of sucrose with mannitol exchange, a condition
which is possibly unavoidable when continuous tissue
superfusion cannot be established (draw–reﬁll method).
so, any current transients when sucrose was replaced or
re-introduced might have gone unnoticed. indeed, at a
constant perfusion rate as in our experiments, when
mannitol was substituted for sucrose, subsequent to the

531

cycle sucrose–glucose–sucrose, a likewise transitory k+
current stimulation as observed with glucose (fig. 4 but
see also figs. 1, 2, 3) occurred. the current dropped far
below the control level (not depicted here; but see
figs. 1, 2, 3), as was found with glucose, conﬁrming in
this respect the results of moﬀett (1979).
while a current decay—focussing on metabolism—may seem easily explainable in the case of sucrose
substitution with mannitol, the drastic reduction in k+
transport in the presence of glucose cannot be understood if sucrose splitting is supposed to supply transport
energy. in each of the seven experiments with bilateral
sucrose–mannitol substitution, and in nine experiments
using glucose in place of sucrose, we observed a clear
initial positive current transient upon sucrose removal,
ranging from 15–50% above the control current in sucrose saline. with mannitol, the initial stimulation
maximum at 2.4±0.3 min after solution change was
119.6±7.0% (n=7) of the control value in sucrose,
while with glucose a transient maximum of 122.0±4.0%
was attained at 2.4±0.1 min after solution change
(n=9). after 10 min, the current in the presence of
mannitol had dropped to 71.5±5.0% (n=5) which
roughly conﬁrms the data reported by moﬀett (1979).
with glucose, the current decreased to 65.6±6.1% of
the control after 10 min (n=5) and to 61±4% after
20 min (n=5). for 2 and 10 min after sucrose replacement, a summary is depicted in fig. 1. that the current
values attained after longer exposure to mannitol or
glucose may become quite low, can easily be inferred
from a time course extrapolation, e.g. in the experiments
shown in figs. 2, 3, 4, 5.
we also tested fructose as substitute for sucrose
(fig. 5) and found basically the same behaviour as with
glucose, namely, an initial stimulation followed by a
sharp current decrease; however, only the latter conﬁrms
the data presented by moﬀett (1979). sucrose in the diet

dopteran caterpillars (thompson 1999; thompson and
redak 2000). since in mammalian (ushijima et al. 1995;
weiss et al. 1995) and insect intestines (koch and
moﬀett 1987; turunen and crailsheim 1996) sucrose is
split into its monosaccharides before these commence
their route into the epithelium, we speculated that an
equimolar mixture of glucose and fructose, iso-osmotic
with sucrose in the saline, might restore the k+ current
to the magnitude known from sucrose saline. such an
experiment was not devised by moﬀett (1979). as shown
in fig. 5, substituting glucose with a 1:1 mixture of
glucose and fructose did not lead at all to a current
recovery. instead, only with sucrose as an osmolyte did
the current recover. we observed this behaviour in two
midguts tested: the average current stimulation maximum 3 min after solution change from sucrose to fructose saline was 118.5% of the control, followed by a
drop to 93.5% after 10 min and 51% after 20 min (see
also fig. 1). this roughly reﬂects the current decrease
after 1 h as reported by moﬀett (1979).
the very small portion (<2%) of saline sucrose that
is hydrolysed by the midgut invertase (koch and moﬀett
1987) could suﬃce, in principle, to energise active k+
transport. consequently, we tried (in three experiments)
to inhibit sucrose hydrolysis by adding the invertase
inhibitor, acarbose, to the standard saline. acarbose
functions in vertebrates (heitlinger et al. 1991) but also
insects (bounias 1982; nectoux et al. 1995). up to
concentrations of 10 mm, this blocker exerted no
inﬂuence on the k+ current even after 25 min of
exposure time (data not shown). we therefore tentatively concluded the following: (1) with respect to the
documented role of sucrose as major energiser in the
mammalian intestine, we have found, so far, no indication of a similar, energy-related uptake into the caterpillar midgut epithelial cells of glucose and fructose
originating from sucrose after being split by invertase, as
neither of these solutes alone nor their mixture, substi-

532

tuting for sucrose, can support k+ secretion as sucrose
does. (2) an extracellular, probably apical, membranebound invertase does not seem to play any role in the
magnitude of the current and thus does not deliver a
simple hypothesis of why sucrose, but not glucose/
fructose, sustains k+ transport. (3) moreover, although
envisaged by some investigators (harvey and nedergaard 1964; thompson 1999; thompson and redak
2000) but doubted by others (chamberlin 1989; ziegler
1999), the direct energisation of k+ secretion in the
insect midgut by any of the metabolisable saline osmolytes tested so far (sucrose, glucose, fructose) seems
unlikely, based on our results and partly on those obtained by moﬀett (1979). (4) finally, the fact that sucrose removal eventually results, on the one hand, in the
loss of k+ current but provokes, on the other hand, a
clear, although transient, current stimulation right after
sucrose replacement with glucose or fructose as well as
mannitol, does not suggest that this positive current
transient is simply a result of improved energisation.
rather, diﬀerent mechanisms may account for both
stimulatory as well as inhibitory eﬀects after sucrose
substitution.
in the following, we inspected more closely the
changes in k+ current which we addressed in fig. 4 in
the context of glucose substitution for sucrose. moﬀett
(1979) stated that apical as well as basolateral sucrose
substitution could provoke the reported changes in
current. however, in our experiments, the origin of the
current stimulation directly after sucrose replacement
by glucose or mannitol (see e.g. figs. 1, 2, 3, 4)
appeared to be merely a related phenomenon. a
characteristic time course can be seen in fig. 2. when
sucrose was basolaterally replaced with mannitol, we
saw a transient current stimulation as seen in the preceding experiments. it was also obvious that thereafter
ik tended to drop quickly below the control value
(sucrose), as was previously reported by moﬀett (1979).
when, after returning to sucrose on the basolateral
side, sucrose was then replaced only apically by mannitol, no transient stimulation could be seen but, instead, ik decreased immediately (fig. 2). the depicted
experiment is one of three leading to similar results.
fig. 6 typical k+ current time
course when sucrose (suc) in
the standard saline is isoosmotically substituted with
either peg 200 (n=5), 400
(n=2) or 600 (n=3) on both
sides

our ﬁndings clearly illustrate that the ik stimulation
originates basolaterally while the eventual drop in ik,
long after withdrawal of sucrose, may be a phenomenon related to a property of both epithelial sides. the
latter was also the conclusion drawn previously by
moﬀett (1979).
other sucrose surrogates: polyethylene glycols, nacl,
trehalose, raﬃnose, urea
moﬀett (1979) checked the inﬂuence of the polyethylene
glycols (peg) 300 and 400 and reported a current decrease of up to 50% when they replaced sucrose. we
compared peg 200, 400 and 600. interestingly, and in a
certain analogy to the sidedness of the ik changes as
observed with mannitol substituted for sucrose (fig. 2),
we now found (fig. 6) that peg 200 as bilateral sucrose
substitute behaved just like glucose or mannitol (ﬁrst
stimulating, then decreasing the current), whereas no
transient ik stimulation but just a clear and immediate
drop was observed with peg 400 and 600. even more
conspicuous is the ﬁnding that the rate of the ik decrease
as well as the low level of the current that was eventually
attained, and also the rate of current recovery after
reintroduction of sucrose seemed dramatically enhanced
with the larger pegs. as displayed in fig. 1, with peg
200 the maximum current stimulation occurred at
116.6±4.0% of control at 2.4±1.9 min after solution
change (n=5), whereas the current had dropped to
64±3% after 10 min of exposure time (n=4). as also
evident from that ﬁgure, peg 400 and 600 never stimulated the current but produced only current decreases
at 2 and 10 min after sucrose substitution (see also
fig. 6).  xxxd1891xxx  min after sucrose substitution with peg
400, we noted a current drop to a mean of 67.5% (n=2)
below the control value, and with peg 600 a drop to
40±9% (n=3), also without stimulatory transient (see
fig. 6).
we also performed two experiments with the trisaccharide raﬃnose (data not shown), and also with the
disaccharide trehalose and with nacl (see fig. 1) as isoosmotic substitutes for sucrose, and obtained results
which seemed comparable to the ones obtained with

533

peg 600. with respect to raﬃnose and trehalose, our
data are in clear contrast to the results of moﬀett (1979;
moﬀett did not test nacl) where these saccharides
supported k+ secretion almost like sucrose did. our
data may indicate that not only the large size of a solute
(>300 da), which suggests a low membrane permeability, plays a major role in the observed eﬀect on ik,
namely, an immediate current decrease without transient
stimulation on sucrose substitution, but also the wellknown conductive membrane impermeabilty as demonstrated for na+ (schirmanns and zeiske 1994b) and cl
(chao et al. 1989) plays a role.
as another small but presumably permeant osmolyte
(carroll and ellar 1993), we tested urea in place of sucrose. corroborating previous results (alpert and zeiske, unpublished; zeiske et al. 1990), we found an initial
current stimulation followed by complete inhibition of
ik (not shown here). since urea (alpert and zeiske,
unpublished; carroll and ellar 1993), glucose (carroll
and ellar 1993) and mannitol (moﬀett 1979; abramchek
et al. 1980) have formerly been suggested to permeate
manduca midgut cell membranes, we hypothesise that
their putative uptake into the cells might result in the
well-known phenomenon of iso-osmotic cell swelling as,
indeed, was suggested for mannitol by the radioactive
tracer data of abramchek et al. (1980) and by a histological approach (moﬀett 1979) in the caterpillar midgut. therefore we attempted, in the following, to ﬁnd
similarities between hypo-osmotically induced ik changes (zeiske et al. 1990) and those dependent on the small
solutes as presented above.
hypo-osmotic sucrose omission versus iso-osmotic
sucrose replacement
previous work (zeiske et al. 1990) has shown that a
hypo-osmotic reduction of the basolateral, but not
luminal, sucrose concentration resulted in a rapid increase in k+ current, presumably due to cell swelling.
thereafter, ik was slowly lost, and the ratio of ik

zeiske et al. (1990)

stimulation to depression decreased with an increase in
hypo-osmotic shock gradient. reducing the sucrose
concentration by half produced an initial 25–30% current increase. conversely, when sucrose was added to
yield hyper-osmotic conditions, ik decreased quickly.
such a hyper-osmotic shock was markedly reversible,
while hypo-osmotic shocks were much less reversible.
upon complete, hypo-osmotic sucrose removal on
both sides (fig. 7), a quick but transient current rise
was followed by a roll-oﬀ, however, without recovery
upon early sucrose re-introduction (c.f. zeiske et al.
1990). this became even worse after a second hypoosmotic shock. reversibility was, however, obtained
when a ‘‘pseudo-hypo-osmotic’’ shock was applied as
illustrated in fig. 3. here, we ﬁrst added 166 mm
mannitol to the sucrose-containing saline, thus doubling non-electrolyte osmolarity and presumably
shrinking the cells and depressing the current (see also
zeiske et al. 1990). removing sucrose, but leaving
mannitol in the solution, i.e. returning to iso-osmotic
conditions, produced the same results as seen above,
namely, a positive current transient followed by a drop.
this time, on re-introducing sucrose in exchange for
mannitol, ik recovered quickly to almost the control
value. we observed qualitatively similar behaviour in
all three tested midguts (however, we refrain from
statistical analysis due to the considerable quantitative
scatter for which we so far have no explanation). the
experiment suggests that maintaining the bath osmolarity while omitting sucrose guarantees not only current reversibility, but also that the mere omission of
sucrose despite high saline osmolarity generates the
eventual fall in k+ current.
our next question addressed whether the transient
current stimulation after sucrose substitution with small
solutes (glucose etc.) might result from iso-osmotic cell
swelling. figure 8 shows a protocol in one of two preliminary experiments with similar outcomes, where ﬁrst
a hypo-osmotic shock (sucrose removal) was applied.
shortly before the maximum ik stimulation was obtained this way, glucose was added to render the saline

534

iso-osmotic again. we observed that the marked current
increase, as seen earlier upon addition of glucose when
removing sucrose, was now lacking; thus, hypo-osmolarity and the substitution of glucose for sucrose did not
result in an additive current stimulation. when, after
restoring standard conditions (fig. 8), glucose was given
ﬁrst in exchange for sucrose, followed by complete glucose removal to produce a hypo-osmotic shock, we also
observed no additivity of glucose- and hypo-osmolarityinduced ik stimulation. at this stage of investigation, we
may conclude that both manoeuvres, exchanging glucose for sucrose, as well as applying a hypo-osmotic
shock, seem to be synergistic with respect to the initial
transient rise in the k+ current. thus, it may be hypothesised that, just as with hypo-osmolarity, a swellingrelated mechanism may underlie the current-stimulating
eﬀect observed with glucose. as not only the midgut
membranes’ permeability for glucose (carroll and ellar
1993) but also for mannitol (moﬀett 1979; abramchek
et al. 1980) and urea (carroll and ellar 1993) has been
convincingly demonstrated, the current stimulation
upon substitution of ‘‘small osmolytes’’ for sucrose may
be the consequence of iso-osmotic cell swelling if these
compounds were to enter the cells. on the other hand,
the fact that much, if not all, of ik is eventually lost in
sucrose-free conditions, hypo-osmotic or not, could be
understandable if sucrose were not only an extra- but
also an intracellular osmolyte whose washout leads to
cell shrinking.

discussion
our results suggest that sucrose as the major osmolyte
in standard saline does not play a decisive role as a k+
transport-energising compound. while acute sucrose
removal from the saline eventually leads to a dramatic
reduction in the k+ current, neither glucose nor
fructose nor their mixture would restore a high ik.

a corroborating ﬁnding is that the invertase inhibitor,
acarbose, is without inﬂuence on k+ transport in the
presence of sucrose. an initial transient rise in current
was observed when sucrose was bilaterally substituted
with smaller osmolytes, whether they were metabolisable or not. this stimulation thus can not be interpreted as a better energisation of transport as
underlying process. furthermore, the stimulatory eﬀect,
for example, of mannitol was elicited only by solution
exchanges on the basolateral side. current stimulation
by hypo-osmotic shocks and by small sucrose substitutes seemed mutually exclusive. in experiments where
sucrose was iso-osmotically replaced with large and/or
impermeant solutes, metabolisable or not, only a fast
but quickly reversible loss of ik was obtained. therefore, we conclude that sucrose in the standard saline is
neither a natural energiser of k+ secretion nor does it
play a simple role as an extracellular osmolyte.
methodological aspects
set-up and interpretation of isc
in haemolymph-side k+-free conditions, the isc
approaches zero (harvey et al. 1983; zeiske et al. 1986;
schirmanns and zeiske 1994a). isc can therefore be
termed ik, a k+-speciﬁc secretory current. since all
changes in ik with respect to sucrose removal from the
saline, iso- or hypo-osmotic, were strictly coupled to the
presence of basolateral k+ (not shown here), all
observed eﬀects must be attributed to changes in k+
current. the good current reversibility after re-introduction of sucrose at the end of iso-osmotic experiments,
which never took longer than 1 h, can be taken as good
evidence of tissue that is undamaged by the experimental
challenges. unlike after the change from one osmolyte
to another, reversibility was severely disturbed only after
purely hypo-osmotic treatment.

omission of non-ionic solutes like sucrose will not
inﬂuence the ionic strength of the solutions. thus, their
conductivity will not change and any bias from erroneous voltage clamping (zeiske et al. 1986; schirmanns
and zeiske 1994a, 1994b) is excluded; therefore, isc will
truly
represent
ik.
the
midgut
epithelium
appears—macroscopically—to belong to the class of
low-resistance epithelia where the nominal conductance
of the tissue and of the bathing solutions is of comparable magnitude. however, the high folding factor of at
least 20 (dow 1992) and the extremely small junctional
permeability for sucrose (koch and moﬀett 1987) as
well as the very high transepithelial voltages tell us that
the midgut is, indeed, a very tight epithelium. our shortdistance arrangement of the voltage electrodes will
nevertheless minimise any clamping errors (zeiske et al.
1986; zeiske et al. 1990; schirmanns and zeiske 1994a,
1994b).
most laboratories working on caterpillar midgut use
pure oxygen gassing of the bathing solutions in order to
maximise the potassium current, which can double when
going from air to pure oxygen (haskell et al. 1965;
harvey et al. 1990). this appears to be due to maximised
atp production (mandel et al. 1980a, 1980b; chamberlin 1987) leading to a maximum pump rate of the vatpase that drives k+ secretion via the antiporter. we
chose air gassing, as in our earlier work (zeiske et al.
1986, 1990, 1992, 2002; schirmanns and zeiske 1994a,
1994b) for obvious physiological reasons; gassing with
air has also been used before by other investigators (e.g.
harvey and nedergaard 1964; harvey et al. 1983;
moﬀett 1979). the constantly high perfusion rate of the
chambers with well-aerated salines guarantees that ik
will not be subject to modulation arising from oxygen
deﬁciency or delayed co2 and metabolic waste removal
(harvey et al. 1990).
the inherent and practically unavoidable downward
drift of the k+ current is typical of excised caterpillar
midgut preparations whatever the artiﬁcial saline composition might be (see also haskell et al. 1965; wolfersberger and giangiacomo 1983; chamberlin 1989).
attempts have been made by others (wolfersberger and
giangiacomo 1983; thomas and may 1984; parenti
et al. 1985; chamberlin 1989) to elucidate and counteract the ik run-down with little success. a reversible
dissociation of the v-atpase into membrane-bound
v0 and water-soluble, cytosolic v1 subcomplexes as
observed after starving or moulting (sumner et al. 1995;
reineke et al. 2002), could underlie this run-down of k+
secretion after tissue mounting in the ussing chamber.
as can be judged from the very fast rates of current
drop when, for example, basolateral na+ is exchanged
for k+ (see e.g. zeiske et al. 1986, 1992 or schirmanns
and zeiske 1994a, 1994b) and when k+ channels are
blocked by barium (zeiske et al. 1986) or protons (zeiske
et al. 2002), our perfusion system allows a solution
change in the ussing chamber compartments in much
less than 1 min, thus much faster, for example, than the
current stimulation that occurred with small osmolytes.

this is reﬂected in the speed of current drop when even
the large peg 600 molecule replaces sucrose in the saline
(fig. 6). it seems reasonable that in order to achieve an
exchange of bigger molecules like sucrose, more time
may be needed than with small solutes due to diﬀusional
delays. however, the work by abramcheck et al. (1980)
and koch and moﬀett (1987) made clear that more than
90% of the sucrose distribution within the entire accessible space occurred within about 10 min. the question
arises, therefore, of whether the stimulatory current
transients that we observed when sucrose was replaced
with smaller osmolytes were an artefact or not.
when peg 600 was tested (fig. 6), the current drop
mainly occurred within 2 min. this interval is about the
average time to attain the maximum transient ik stimulation after sucrose substitution by small solutes but by
far shorter than the time required for the eventual current drop thereafter. clearly, this then suggests that it is
not diﬀusional delays but rather delayed reactions of the
potassium transport machinery that are responsible for
the changes in current when sucrose has been replaced
iso-osmotically. when, for instance, a larger osmolyte
like sucrose is replaced with the smaller glucose molecule, one could argue that at least the extracellular space
for solute distribution will transiently become hyperosmotic (washout of sucrose slower than wash-in of
glucose), due to the inverse relationship between solute
size and diﬀusion coeﬃcient. we know, however, from
an earlier study on m. sexta midgut (zeiske et al. 1990)
that hyper-osmolarity causes a quick and reversible decrease in k+ current, rather than an increase (see also
fig. 3). we conclude, therefore, that the initial current
stimulation by osmolytes smaller than sucrose is not an
artefact. rather, the current response (fig. 4) of the
epithelial cells to this small, presumably membranepermeant osmolyte (carroll and ellar 1993) may be related to such a ﬁnite membrane permeability. because
other small osmolytes like urea (carroll and ellar 1993)
and mannitol (moﬀett 1979; abramchek et al. 1980)
have also been shown to possess a ﬁnite membrane
permeability in midgut caterpillar enterocytes, we would
consequently expect cell swelling due to water inﬂux
following small solute permeation after exchange for
sucrose (so-called iso-osmotic swelling). this, however,
should instead cause the potassium current to increase,
as reported for hypo-osmotic shocks (zeiske et al. 1990).
the question why this current stimulation with small
osmolytes was only transient will be addressed further
below.
based on a number of studies (moﬀett et al. 1982;
zeiske et al. 1986, 1990, 1992, 2002; klein et al. 1996;
schirmanns and zeiske 1994b), the macroscopic saturating k+ current kinetics (dependence of ik on haemolymph k+ concentration) are generated by inherent
properties of the basolateral k+ channels. mandel et al.
(1980a, 1980b) demonstrated for manduca midgut that,
at high oxygen pressure, the mitochondrial respiration
rate, and therefore the active h+ pump supply with
atp, seems to be at its upper limit, whether sucrose (k+

536

current high) or glucose (k+ current low) was the
principal saline osmolyte. this may support our view
that the overall k+ transport rate-limiting step is not
located apically, despite the electrically resistive dominance of that membrane (schirmanns and zeiske
1994b), but may be localised to the basolateral membrane as suggested earlier (zeiske et al. 1986, 1992). the
k+ current kinetics follow michaelis-menten rules under all conditions tested so far (moﬀett and koch 1983;
zeiske et al. 1992; schirmanns et al. 1994a, 1994b), and
also after manoevres that lead to cell swelling or
shrinking (zeiske et al. 1990), where no inﬂuence on the
apparent michaelis constant for ion transfer through the
basolateral k+ channels was observed but only an eﬀect
on the maximum current.
sucrose: supply and space
although it is an important component in natural as
well as in artiﬁcial diets, sucrose virtually does not appear in the haemolymph after digestion but appears as
trehalose in concentrations of up to 50 mm (thompson
1999; thompson and redak 2000). nonetheless it exerts
its stimulatory function when compared, for example,
with glucose or fructose, from both epithelial sides
(moﬀett 1979; this paper). according to moﬀett (1979)
and chamberlin (1989), trehalose in the saline [used to
replace sucrose as done by moﬀett (1979), or added to
saline that is deﬁcient in nutrients after long-term
treatment] sustains the k+ secretion almost as eﬀectively as sucrose. this is the opposite of our results.
moﬀett (1979) was the ﬁrst to challenge the concept
that sucrose is a mere energiser/osmolyte. his data
indicated that, without much eﬀect on k+ secretion,
sucrose could be replaced by other di- and trisaccharides
but also by the presumably non-metabolisable peg 400.
on the other hand, he found that ik dropped by about
half when sucrose was replaced with fructose, and to less
than 20% of control with glucose or mannitol as substitutes. this is corroborated by our ﬁndings, in that
neither a 1:1 glucose–fructose mixture restored full k+
secretion, nor was k+ secretion aﬀected by the application of the invertase inhibitor acarbose in control
saline. moﬀett (1979) found a linear relationship
between k+ transport and sucrose concentration.
moreover, a clear shift occurred in the parameters that
give information about the basolateral, saturating ratelimiting step (see below). to summarise, our results with
the sucrose substitutes mannitol, glucose, fructose and
smaller pegs conﬁrm moﬀett’s (1979) obervations of an
eventually greatly reduced current, as compared to
sucrose saline. our data are, however, at variance with
those of moﬀett (1979) in which large di- or trisaccharides as well as peg 400 sustained potassium secretion;
this was clearly not the case in the experiments reported
here. at this time, we cannot oﬀer an explanation for
this.
in the non-animal realm, disaccharides are wellknown to be membrane-permeant, e.g. in symport with

h+ in bacteria (naderi and saier 1996) or in plants
(lalonde et al. 1999; lemoine 2000). sucrose is generally
assumed, in vertebrate tissues, to be membrane-impermeant just like other di- or trisaccharides, or like mannitol, or anions such as gluconate or sulphate, those
sometimes used as markers of the extracellular space. in
addition, sucrose may be a convenient measure of
paracellular permeability in epithelia (koch and moﬀett
1987). on the other hand, and unexpectedly, mannitol
but also sulphate could be shown to equilibrate with all
of the epithelial water space in m. sexta midgut
(abramchek et al. 1980). furthermore, glucose and urea
were recognised to be passively permeant through lepidopteran midgut columnar cell apical brushborder
membranes (carroll and ellar 1993). as a consequence,
and according to moﬀett’s (1979) observation of tissue
swelling after a substitution of mannitol for sucrose, the
ensuing rise in tissue water content can be explained
when sucrose, a supposedly less membrane-permeant
solute, is replaced with a permeant one, possibly leading
to iso-osmotic cell swelling. moﬀett’s (1979) interpretation of a drop in ik being due to an ensuing decrease in
the intracellular k+ transport pool is questionable as
cell swelling leads to an increase in ik rather than a
decrease (zeiske et al. 1990; figs. 7, 8, this paper).
in most reports on the animal tissue space available
for the diﬀusional distribution of sucrose, it is tacitly
assumed that this distribution is restricted, by deﬁnition,
to the extracellular space. the space available for water
distribution is then also tacitly assumed to represent the
sum of intra- and extracellular spaces, here also
including that of the goblet cavity. based on the structural complexity of the highly folded midgut epithelium
(moﬀett 1979; dow 1992), we may have to cope with a
much-restricted solute diﬀusion everywhere but certainly
between the goblet cavity and gut lumen (moﬀett 1979;
dow and peacock 1989; dow 1992; moﬀett et al. 1995)
and elsewhere in meandering ways between the cells.
koch and moﬀett (1987) therefore argued that not more
than 70% of the applied sucrose would equilibrate with
the available extracellular space. it is an open question
whether luminal sucrose would equilibrate with the
goblet cavity. a quite tight goblet valve was concluded
from results by dow and peacock (1989), moﬀett
(1979), and moﬀett et al. (1995). if it cannot be excluded
a priori that sucrose might cross plasma membranes of
at least one population of cells, as in plants, e.g. the
columnar cells which are involved in the majority of
transepithelial nutrient movements (sacchi and wolfersberger 1996) and have been reported to contain
invertase activity (turunen and crailsheim 1996), the
interpretation of sucrose distribution data strongly hinges on obvious diﬀerences in diﬀusion rate constants and
their unambiguous determination when studying the
tissue distribution of labelled solutes. even if sucrose
were to enter the goblet cavity from the luminal side, it
would not be able to pass the gcam membrane which
appears impermeable to the disaccharide (wieczorek
et al. 1989).

537

sucrose: an extracellular ‘‘compatible’’ osmolyte?
in contrast to na+ ions, intracellularly abundant k+
ions seem to be compatible inorganic osmolytes
(rothschild and mancinelli 2001). compatible osmolytes such as trehalose or sucrose are known to protect
enzymes from unfolding by chaotropic compounds and
also contribute to membrane stabilisation during desiccation (potts 1994). they have been described as mimicking a stiﬀ hydration shell around proteins during
hyper-osmotic stress conditions. for these reasons, sucrose has become a well-known ‘‘stabiliser’’ in food
preservation. compatible osmolytes occur in bulk concentrations of tens to hundreds of millimoles, maybe
much higher locally around proteins. protein-stabilising
eﬀects may therefore be expected when the concentration of the medium rises, e.g. during desiccation.
with respect to k+ transport, the high extracellular
concentration of sucrose in the standard saline might
well stabilise, for example, the basolateral k+ channels
in the epithelial tissue. if this were so, we would have to
assume a greater speciﬁcity of sucrose over all other
sucrose substitutes tested.
this may at least make sense for the lumen side that
is exposed to high in vivo sucrose concentrations in
natural or artiﬁcial food (bell and joachim 1974).
basolaterally, although not naturally occurring there,
sucrose may nevertheless be an ‘‘optimal’’, though artiﬁcial, agent in supporting ik, but such a role in vivo will
probably be taken over by haemolymph constituents,
e.g. trehalose (thompson et al. 2003) and a number of
organic compounds that have also been shown to stimulate k+ transport (parenti et al. 1985; chamberlin
1989).
most interestingly, the experiments reported by
moﬀett (1979) showed that the substitution of mannitol
with sucrose in the saline shifted the parameters of the
k+ current kinetics (maximum current and apparent
michaelis constant) proportionally to higher values, a
feature which was also observed later (zeiske et al. 1992)
when only basolateral saline halides, stimulating ik in
the very same way as sucrose does, replaced gluconate or
nitrate as the major anion. zeiske et al. (1992) proposed
that halides might stabilise the basolateral k+ channel,
being the rate-limiting step of the transepithelial k+
current (zeiske et al. 1986), in such a way that the k+binding aﬃnity of the channel would be lowered and so
enhance the transport rate across the membrane. an
analogous inﬂuence of sucrose on the channel, similar,
for example, to that of chloride, even if diﬀerent in
mechanistic details, could therefore also play a role in
the chain of events that lead to k+ current stimulation
by sucrose. thus, the assumption of a structural stabilisation by extracellular sucrose of the k+ channels, now
with sucrose acting as a typical compatible osmolyte,
may not seem too far-fetched. moreover, this may also
pertain to apical goblet cell membrane transporters involved in k+ transfer, given a ﬁnite sucrose permeability of the goblet valve.

could sucrose be an intracellular ‘‘compatible’’
osmolyte?
for animal cells, the existence of speciﬁc membrane
transporters for disaccharides has not been reported to
date. should they exist, sucrose could share a role as an
intracellular compatible osmolyte, as in plants or bacteria (qu et al. 1998). regulatory volume decrease after
cell swelling includes the loss of kcl (parker 1993) and
also, in many cells, a loss of larger organic osmolytes via
a volume-sensitive organic osmolyte/anion channel
which is also permeable to sucrose (kirk and strange
1998). other candidates for sucrose permeation might be
eukaryotic plasma-membrane porins (thinnes and
reymann 1997) or ‘‘waste’’ pathways that are normally
used by mono- or dicarboxylic anions that stem from
metabolism (junankar and kirk 2000). also, some types
of aquaporins (aqp) (zardoya and villalba 2001), such
as aqp 9 which shows a very broad selectivity to polyols
but not to cyclic sugars (tsukaguchi et al. 1998), may
turn out to be permeable to sucrose. supposing that
sucrose, being a putative compatible osmolyte, can enter
or leave the midgut cells, its presumed protein-stabilising
eﬀects could have to do with a stabilising inﬂuence, from
the cytosolic side, on structure/function of the three
transport proteins that achieve k+ secretion, i.e. channels, v-atpase and antiporter. as mentioned above,
only glucose, mannitol and urea are known thus far to
pass midgut cell membranes. clearly, if membranepermeant, their rate of transport/metabolism should
have an impact on cell volume.
as was most recently suggested by the data from
genome analyses of drosophila and, by comparison, with
humans (adams et al. 2000; pubmed nucleotide search
acc. no. cg 4484), proteins showing striking similarities to plant sucrose transporters also seem to be
encoded by animal cells. indeed, based on recent
experiments from our laboratory (h. meyer and h.
wieczorek, unpublished results) we found early evidence
that a disaccharide transporter might occur in drosophila melanogaster: antibodies against a heterologously expressed part of the protein localized this
putative sucrose transporter to the drosophila midgut
cell plasma membranes. should this result be supported
by further experiments, the mechanism of sucrose
absorption by the gut, in insects as well as in humans,
will have to be re-interpreted and may give rise to a new
paradigm.
