abstract
a model of the  xxxg656xxx  was used to study the receptor interactions of dopamine, the typical antipsychotics haloperidol and
 xxxd2511xxx , and the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and melperone. the atypical antipsychotics interacted with the halogen atom of the ring
system in the direction of the transmembrane helices (tmhs) 2, 3 and 7, while the typical had the corresponding halogen atom in the direction
of tmh5. molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the average helical displacement upon binding increased in the order: typical
< atypical < dopamine. upon binding, the atypical induced larger displacements into tmh5 than did the typical. the typical had stronger
non-bonded interactions with the receptor than had the atypical, which is in agreement with the experimental observation that the atypical
antipsychotic drugs dissociate faster from the receptor than the typical antipsychotic drugs.

1. introduction
g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) are characterised by
seven highly conserved transmembrane helices (tmhs), connected to by intracellular (ic) and extracellular (ec) loops.
there are five different subtypes of dopamine receptors (d1–
d5), which all belong to the rhodopsin family of gpcrs [1].
the binding site of dopamine is within a water accessible
crevice extending from the ec surface of the receptors into
the transmembrane domain between the tmhs. the surface
of this crevice is formed by amino acids contributing to receptor specific ligand recognition and binding.
schizophrenia is a complex and heterogeneous group of
diseases for which the aetiology and pathogenesis are incompletely understood. schizophrenia is associated with increased
activity at dopaminergic receptor sites [2,3], and the therapeutic effect of antipsychotic drugs is, at least in part, connected to antagonist action at dopamine receptors in the brain.
certain antipsychotic drugs are also potent  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonists. positron emission tomographic (pet) data have
demonstrated that certain antipsychotics drugs at subthera* corresponding author. tel.: +47 77 64 4705; fax: +47 77 64 5310.

peutic doses saturate  xxxg1113xxx  binding, indicating that
5-ht2 occupancy alone is not enough for mediating the antipsychotic effects [4].
it has been demonstrated that a “threshold” of d2 occupancy is required to induce the antipsychotic response [5].
the incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (eps) also
increases with a d2 occupancy above 80% [5]. the atypical
antipsychotic drug clozapine, has a lower incidence of eps,
and has a lower degree of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy at therapeutic doses than the typical antipsychotic drugs. the lower
d2 occupancy appears to be driven by a faster dissociation
from the receptor [4,6,7].
detailed knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of
action of atypical and typical antipsychotic drugs is important for understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and for design of new drugs with improved efficacy and
fewer side effects than the existing ones. the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin [8] was the first reported threedimensional (3d) structure of a gpcr at atomic resolution.
this structure provides a possibility of using a traditional
homology modelling approach to predict the structures of
other gpcrs of the rhodopsin family. in the present study, a
3d model of the human  xxxg656xxx  was constructed, using the crystal structure of rhodopsin as template.

the  xxxg656xxx  model was used to study the receptor interactions of dopamine, the typical antipsychotic drugs, haloperidol and  xxxd2511xxx , and the atypical antipsychotic drugs,
clozapine and melperone [9–11].
2. results
the root mean square (rms) difference between the backbone atoms of the tmhs in the initial energy refined dopamine d2 model and the x-ray structure of rhodopsin was 0.4 å.
after 750 ps of md of the receptor model, the rms difference between the rhodopsin structure and the average structure from the simulation was 3.1 å, with largest rms differences in tmh5 and tmh6. the electrostatic potentials
outside the water accessible surface of the receptor model
showed a dipolar structure with the ec regions more negative than the ic regions (fig. 1).

directed mutagenesis were used as controls of the tested ligand
interaction modes. the docking procedure indicated that the
structurally similar drugs clozapine and  xxxd2511xxx  (fig. 2) bind
the receptor with the chlorine atom in different orientations.
the most favourable interaction mode of clozapine was with
the chlorine atom in the direction of tmh3 and tmh7 while
the chlorine atom of  xxxd2511xxx  was in the direction of
tmh5 and tmh6 (fig. 3). the docking procedure also indicated that haloperidol and melperone bind the  xxxg656xxx 
with the fluorine atom of the ring system (fig. 2) differently
oriented in the binding pocket. haloperidol had the fluorine
atom in the direction of tmh5, while melperone had the fluorine atom in the direction of amino acids in tmh2 and tmh7
(fig. 3).

[12,13]. the carboxyl group of the  xxxd233xxx  residue was
oriented directly towards the protonated nitrogen atom of the
ligand in all the complexes (fig. 3). the ligands also interacted strongly with other amino acids in tmh3, and with
amino acids in tmh6 and tmh7 (table 1). the ligands did
not have van der waals contacts with amino acids in
tmh1 and tmh4.
the typical antipsychotic drugs, haloperidol and  xxxd2511xxx , had stronger interactions with tmh6 than had the atypical antipsychotic drugs, clozapine and melperone (table 1).
the typical antipsychotics also had stronger interactions with
tmh5 than the atypical. haloperidol had van der waals contacts with ser193, ser194, and phe189, while  xxxd2511xxx  had
van der waals contact with val190. the atypical antipsychotic drugs showed stronger interaction with phe110, and
weaker interactions with val111 in tmh3, than did the typical antipsychotic drugs (table 1).

important for binding of dopamine to the  xxxg656xxx  [14,15].
this serine is highly conserved among gpcrs, and is important for binding of catecholamines to gpcrs [13].
as shown in table 2 the typical antipsychotic drugs had
stronger non-bonded interaction with the receptor than had
the atypical antipsychotic drugs. the non-bonded interaction
energies of haloperidol and  xxxd2511xxx  were –74.0 and
–67.8 kcal/mol, respectively, while the non-bonded interaction energies of clozapine and melperone were –63.6 and
–60.5 kcal/mol, respectively.
2.3. ligand induced conformational changes
of the receptor
the average structures provide information about the most
populated receptor states during the md simulations. comparison of receptor structures after md of the free receptor
and md of receptor–ligand complexes (table 3), gives an
indication of the structural displacements of specific receptor

induced larger displacements into the helical bundle than did
the antagonists. the average helical displacement upon ligand
binding increased in the order: typical < atypical < dopamine
(table 3). after md, the largest rms differences from the
unbound receptor for the antagonists were in tmh5,
tmh6 and tmh7, while largest difference between the free
receptor and the dopamine-bound receptor structure was in
tmh1, tmh5 and tmh6. compared with the free receptor,
the atypical antipsychotic drugs, clozapine and melperone,
induced larger structural displacements into tmh5 than did
the typical antipsychotic drugs, haloperidol and  xxxd2511xxx .

3. discussion
the success of structural predictions by a homology modelling approach depends strongly upon how closely the modelled structure fits the chosen template. until recently, an exact
3d structure of any gpcr at an atomic level was not known,
and gpcr modelling was based on structural data of bacteriorhodpsin [16] or an electron density projection map of
rhodopsin [17,18], both with relatively limited accuracy. the
present  xxxg656xxx  model should therefore give a more precise prediction of ligand binding than previous  xxxg656xxx 
models based on bacteriorhodopsin or the electron density
projection map of rhodopsin. the amino acid identity between
backbone atoms in the tmhs of bovine rhodopsin and the
human  xxxg656xxx  is about 20%. structural analysis and
visual inspection indicated large similarities between the
 xxxg656xxx  model and the experimental rhodopsin structure:
1. the rms differences between the backbone atoms within
tmhs were 0.4 å before and 3.1 å after md simulation of
the free receptor. 2. highly conserved amino acids in the
rhodopsin family of g-protein coupled receptors were located
in similar positions and in similar conformations. 3. large
similarities in fragments known to be crucial for activation
and ligand binding. further, the amino acids constituting the

189

interior polar cavity of the receptor model are in agreement
with suggestions from experimental studies using the cysteine accessibility method (scam) [19–21]. altogether, this
suggests that the present  xxxg656xxx  model is a valuable tool
for studying the ligand interactions with the  xxxg656xxx . still,
the present model must be considered as an approximation of
the functional protein.
site-directed substitutions of single amino acids, combined with experimental results from structure–affinity relationship studies of ligands, allows mapping of structurally
and functionally important amino acids in the receptor, and
may be used to validate the present  xxxg656xxx  model. a
ligand at the  xxxg656xxx  binding site may be shielded or stabilised by several highly conserved aromatic and hydrophobic residues located in tmh3 (ile109, phe110, val111),
tmh6 (val378, phe382, trp386, phe389, phe390, ile394,
ile397), and tmh7 (leu407, tyr408, phe411, trp413,
tyr416, tyr426) [12,22]. agonist binding was also affected
when serine residues in tmh5 of the  xxxg656xxx  were
mutated [12,23]. in the present model, phe110, val111,
ser193, ser194, phe389, phe390, ile394, ile397, tyr408,
trp413 and tyr416 were all directly involved in ligand binding (table 1). ile109, val378, phe382, trp386, leu407,
phe411 and tyr426 were facing the interior of the central
core involved in aromatic or hydrophobic interactions within
the receptor, suggesting that these amino acids are important
for maintaining of a proper structure of the binding site.
ile109 interacted with leu86 and trp90 in tmh2. val378 interacted with ile73 (tmh2), ile425 (tmh7) and tyr426
(tmh7). phe382 was facing phe198 (tmh5) and phe202
(tmh5), while trp386 interacted with phe198 (tmh5) and
phe411 (tmh7). leu407 interacted with leu395 (tmh6),
while tyr426 interacted with val55 (tmh1), ile73 (tmh2)
and val378 (tmh6). the present model suggests that mutation of these amino acids will affect the binding pocket.
it has been proposed that  xxxg656xxx  antagonists interact
with an aromatic microdomain within the second, third, and
seventh membrane-spanning segments [24]. val91 (tmh2),
phe110 (tmh3), val111 (tmh3) and tyr408 (tmh7) have
been suggested to be in close spatial proximity and form a
part of the microdomain [24,25]. the present model positioned these amino acids in close proximity to each other,
and directly involved in antagonist binding (table 1). modelling and mutational studies have suggested that asn52
(tmh1), asp80 (tmh2), ser121 (tmh3), asn 419 (tmh7),
ser420 (tmh7) and asn423 (tmh7) form a putative sodiumbinding pocket in the  xxxg656xxx  [26]. in the present model,
these amino acids are in close proximity to each other, and
capable of forming such a binding pocket.
3.1. electrostatic potentials of the  xxxg656xxx 
membrane-spanning proteins generally follow a “positiveinside rule” with an overall dipolar distribution of charges

[27]. a dipolar distribution of electrostatic potentials was also
observed in the  xxxg656xxx  model, where the cytoplasmic
regions were more positively charged than the synaptic
regions (fig. 1). similar charge distributions have also been
observed in previous gpcr models based on bactheriorhodopsin [28] or the electron density projection maps of
rhodopsin [29].
most ligands that bind to the  xxxg656xxx  contain an amino group with pka > 7, indicating that the ligands
will be partly or fully positively charged at a physiological
ph of 7.4. evidence for that the protonated form of the ligands
is pharmacologically active has emerged from studies on permanently uncharged  xxxg656xxx  antagonists that bind very
poorly to the receptor compared to the corresponding charged
species [30]. it has, therefore, generally been assumed that
the binding of these ligands to the receptor includes an electrostatic interaction with a negatively charged receptor
domain.
a highly conserved  xxxd233xxx  (asp114) in tmh3 is
important for the binding of both agonists and antagonists to
the  xxxg656xxx  [12,13], and its terminal carboxyl group may
function as an anchoring point for ligands with a protonated
amino group [31]. in the present study, the ligands were
docked into the receptor with the protonated amino group
near asp114. after 750 ps of md simulations, the ligands
had moved slightly compared with the initial position. however, the strong interaction with asp114 was maintained for
all complexes, supporting the suggestion that asp114 functions as an anchoring point for ligands with a protonated
amino group.
javitch et al. [19–21,24,25,32–34] used site-directed
mutagenesis studies to map the amino acids exposed to the
water accessible surface in the helical core of the dopamine
 xxxg656xxx . the present model has a water accessible central core extending from the ec side to about 10 å below
asp114 towards the ic side. from this, a mechanism of ligand
translocation from the ec fluid to the binding site may be
proposed, by which the positively charged ligand is drawn
towards the synaptic parts of the receptor by its negative electrostatic potentials (fig. 1). some of the solvated ligand molecules may migrate down the water filled core and make contacts with the negatively charged asp114, leading to an
exchange process whereby the ligand and the receptor adapt
to each other and release water molecules. asp114 may thus
be a common anchorage point for the positively charge amino
group, whereas other parts of various ligands, which may have
quite diverse molecular structures, may interact with different parts of the receptor. in order to understand these interactions in more detail, it is necessary to obtain more exact information on the 3d structure of the different gpcrs.
3.2.  xxxg656xxx –ligand interactions
a previous study analysing the receptor–ligand interactions of 22 gpcrs with 23 different ligands using proteoch-

emometrics modelling [35] indicated that amino acids within
tmhs 2, 3, 5–7 were positive contributors to ligand affinity.
these observations support the present calculations suggesting that amino acids in tmhs 2, 3, 5–7 of the receptor model
were directly involved in receptor–ligand interactions
(table 1).
site-directed mutagenesis studies have indicated that a
cluster of serine residues in tmh5 (ser193, ser194 and
ser197) is important for agonist binding and receptor activation [14,15,23]. it was suggested that the serine cluster and
dopamine form a hydrogen-bonding network with the parahydroxyl substituent of dopamine interacting with ser194
(fig. 2). such a hydrogen-bonding network was reproduced
by the md simulation of the receptor–dopamine complex
(fig. 3). in the complex the strongest contributor to the network was ser194 (fig. 3), which is consistent with the experimental observation that a ser194ala mutated receptor completely lost dopamine induced activation [14]. in the average
complex after md, the meta-hydroxyl group of dopamine
formed a strong hydrogen bond with ser194 (atomic distance 1.8 å), and a weaker hydrogen bond with ser193
(atomic distance 3.5 å). the para-hydroxyl group formed
hydrogen bonds with ser194 (atomic distance 3.5 å) and
ser197 (atomic distance 3.5 å). the  xxxg656xxx –dopamine
complex suggests that a mutation of one of these serine residues will affect the dopamine position and thereby the dopamine affinity.
the fluorine atom of haloperidol and the chlorine atom of
 xxxd2511xxx  (fig. 2) were located relatively close to ser194, but
were not close enough for direct van der waals contacts
(table 1). however, the fluorine of haloperidol had van der
waals contacts with ser193. the binding modes of the ligands
after md may suggest that strong interactions with
ser194 together with a hydrogen-bonding network involving
ser193, ser194 and ser197 and the ligand is important for a
proper receptor activation. despite both clozapine and  xxxd2511xxx  interacting with the region outside ser194, none of the
antipsychotics were able to form a hydrogen-bonding network as observed for dopamine.
in the x-ray structure of rhodopsin ec2 penetrates into
the ligand binding pocket, and site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that ec2 is important for ligand binding to
several gpcrs (http://www-grap.fagmed.uit.no/grap/
homepage.html). in the present model ec2 was constructed
based on available loop structures in the pdb-database, and
the loop structure must be regarded as relatively uncertain.
the presence of a disulphide bridge between cys 107 (ec1)
and cys 182 (ec2) constrains the loop close to the ligand
binding site. in all ligand–receptor complexes, the region
outside glu181 (ec2) had electrostatic interactions with
the ligand, with an interaction energy varying between
–8.1 kcal/mol (melperone) and –4.0 kcal/mol ( xxxd2511xxx ).
however, direct van der waals contacts between the ligands
and amino acid residues in ec2 were not seen.
unlike the antagonists, dopamine did not interact with
residues in tmh7. this observation is supported by the

e. hjerde et al. / european journal of medicinal chemistry 40 (2005) 185–194

results of site-directed mutagenesis studies (http://wwwgrap.fagmed.uit.no/grap/homepage.html), where mutation
of residues in tmh7 did not influence the binding of dopamine. dopamine had relatively strong interactions with trp386,
phe389 and phe390 in tmh6 (table 1), in agreement with
site-directed mutagenesis studies where mutations of these
residues reduced the affinity of dopamine more than 10,000fold [12].
the main differences in binding mode between the typical
and atypical antipsychotics were that the typical drugs  xxxd2511xxx  and haloperidol bound the receptor with the halogen
atom at the ring system (fig. 2) in the direction of ser194 in
tmh5, while the atypical  xxxd2511xxx  analogue clozapine, and
the atypical haloperidol analogue melperone, both had the
corresponding halogen atom in the direction of residues in
tmh2, tmh3 and tmh7. a position of haloperidol similar
to that of the most favourable melperone position seemed
unrealistic. haloperidol is larger and more bulky than melperone, and in such a position, haloperidol had sterical conflicts with amino acids in tmh5, indicating that large conformational changes of the receptor would be necessary in
order to adopt the haloperidol structure in such a docking
position. the position of the piperazine ring relative to the
ring system is different between the structure of  xxxd2511xxx  and
clozapine (fig. 2). a binding mode of  xxxd2511xxx  with the chlorine atom in a position corresponding to the chlorine of clozapine (fig. 3), would have the protonated piperazine ring further from asp114 than clozapine. therefore, in order to obtain
strong interactions between the protonated piperazine ring
and asp114, the chlorine atom of  xxxd2511xxx  must be in another
orientation than the chlorine atom of clozapine.
the template for the  xxxg656xxx  model represents an inactive conformation of rhodopsin [8], which may suggest that
also the initial d2 model represents an inactive conformation. the helical displacements averaged over the tmhs
(table 3) showed that the agonist dopamine induced larger
helical displacements upon binding than did the antagonists.
upon binding to an inactive receptor conformation, dopamine stabilises the receptor in an active receptor conformation
resulting in large helical displacements compared with the
initial inactive conformation. upon binding of an antagonist,
the antagonist stabilises the receptor in an inactive receptor
conformation resulting in less helical displacements from the
initial inactive conformation than with the agonist.
the typical antipsychotics obtained direct van der waals
contacts with tmh5 (table 1), while the atypical only interacted with tmh5 via long range forces. table 3 shows that
upon binding of an atypical antipsychotic drug, tmh5 is more
displaced from its position in the free receptor than after binding of the typical antipsychotic drugs. this indicates that the
van der waals contacts of the typical antipsychotic drugs with
residues in tmh5 constrain its position relative to the other
tmhs. tmh5 is connected to ic3, which is very important
for g-protein interactions. the differences in structural displacements of tmh5 upon binding of atypical and typical
antipsychotic drugs (table 3) indicate that they are inducing

191

different conformations of ic3, which may affect g-protein
interactions.
both the typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs interacted directly with amino acids in tmh6. however, the typical antipsychotic drugs interacted more strongly with amino
acids in tmh6 than did the atypical ones (table 1). interaction with tmh5 and tmh6 partly explains the stronger nonbonded interaction with the receptor of the typical than of the
atypical drugs (table 2). although the present calculations of
interaction energies are not directly related to ligand binding
affinities and receptor occupation [36], the stronger interaction energy of the typical drugs with tmh5 and tmh6 may
reflect the strength of receptor binding. therefore, this observation supports the experimental observation that the lower
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy of atypical than of typical
drugs may be driven by a faster dissociation from the receptor [4,6,7]. thermodynamic measurements of receptor–
ligand binding showed that binding of agonist and antagonists to some gpcrs gave thermodynamic agonist–antagonist
discrimination [37]. when the agonist binding to a given
receptor was entropy-driven, the binding of its antagonists
was enthalpy-driven, or vice versa. however, this was not
observed for the  xxxg656xxx  [37]. non-bonded interactions
such as hydrogen-bonding interactions are mainly related to
the enthalpic term, while solvent reorganisation upon binding is mainly related to the entropic term. the stronger nonbonded receptor–ligand interactions of the typical drugs
(table 2) may therefore indicate that the higher  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy of the typical than of the atypical drugs may be
related to a stronger enthalpic contribution to receptor binding.
4. conclusions
md simulations indicated that the agonist dopamine
induced larger displacements into the heptahelical bundle than
did the antagonists. further, the atypical antipsychotic drugs
induced larger conformational displacements into tmh5 than
did the typical antipsychotic drugs (table 3). this observation was explained by direct van der waals contacts between
the typical antipsychotic drugs and residues in tmh5 that
stabilised the position of tmh5 relative to the other tmhs.
the typical antipsychotics,  xxxd2511xxx  and haloperidol, were
both oriented with the halogen atom of the ring system in the
direction of tmh5, while the atypical had the corresponding
halogen atom in the direction of tmhs 2, 3 and 7 (fig. 3).
the typical antipsychotics also had stronger non-bonded interactions with tmh6 (table 1), and a stronger non-bonded
interaction with the receptor than the atypical drugs (table 2).
these interactions support the hypothesis that lower receptor
occupancy of the atypical drugs is driven by a faster dissociation from the receptor [4,6,7].

(md) calculations were performed with the amber 5.0 programs [38]. a distance-dependent dielectric function with a
dielectric constant of 4 (e = 4rij, rij = interatomic distance)
was used in the calculations. explicit water molecules were
not included. the cut off radius for non-bonded interactions
during energy minimisation was 15 å. energy minimisation
of the receptor model, and of receptor–ligand complexes was
performed by 500 steps of steepest descent followed by
2000 steps of conjugate gradient minimisation.
md was performed with a 12 å cut off radius for nonbonded interactions, and a secondary cut off radius of 15 å.
all bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using
the shake option. the md simulations were performed at
300 k. in order to preserve the helical conformation of tmhs
during md extra hydrogen-bonding forces (5 kcal/mol) were
applied between the backbone oxygen atom of residue n and
the backbone nitrogen atom of residues n + 4, excluding prolines. extra hydrogen-bonding forces of 5 kcal/mol have been
shown to reproduce the experimentally observed rigid body
movements of tmhs [39,40], and have previously been used
for md of receptor models [41,42].
5.1. construction of the receptor model
a 3d model of the human  xxxg656xxx  was constructed, based on the x-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin
(pdb acquisition code: 1f88). a multiple sequence alignment
including the mammalian dopamine receptor subtypes (d1–
d5), and bovine rhodopsin was performed using the clustalw
1.7 program [43]. all amino acid sequences were obtained
from the swiss prot database (http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/).
the sequence alignment, x-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin [8] and information about amino acid conservation among
the gpcr families (http://www-grap.fagmed.uit.no) were
used to define the start and end positions of the seven tmhs
of the  xxxg656xxx . the start and end positions of tmhs
were; tmh1: arg31–arg61, tmh2: thr68–val97, tmh3:
arg104–ala135, tmh4: lys198–gly173, tmh5: asn186–
val215, tmh6: glu368–cys399, tmh7: pro405–phe429.
an initial structure of  xxxd2316xxx , ec1, ec3 and the n-terminal
were taken directly from the bovine rhodopsin structure and
constructed by changing the rhodopsin side chains into the
corresponding side chains of the  xxxg656xxx . modelling non-conserved regions of certain length is a challenge.
in the present study a combination of secondary structure prediction and available loop structures in the brookhaven pdbdatabase (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) were used to construct
initial models of the non-conserved regions. the c-terminal,
ic2 and ec2 were constructed based on available loop structures. the loop conformations in the database having highest
amino acid sequence homology with each of these receptor
segments were inspected visually for possible steric interactions with its local environment on the receptor. the loop
conformations providing best fit to the helical end positions
and other extramembrane domains were selected, and initial
structures of the receptor segments were constructed by

changing the side chains into those of the corresponding
 xxxg656xxx  segment. pdb acquisition codes:
c-terminal—1ala; ic2—1tdy; ec2—1cgj. ic3 of the
 xxxg656xxx  contains 152 amino acids, and no initial loop structure for the entire loop was found in the pdbdatabase. the predict protein server (http://www.emblheidelberg.de/predictprotein/) indicated four stretches of
b-sheet conformation in the loop, while no clear secondary
structure was indicated for the segments between the
b-stretches. these segments were constructed from available
pdb structures in the pdb-database. the pdb acquisition
code for loop fragments used to construct ic3 were: 3pmg,
2hip,  xxxd1838xxx , 1fcd and 1plf. the b-sheets and these fragments were linked together to form an initial model of ic3.
the loops and terminals were connected to the helical
bundle, and a disulphide bridge was introduced between
cys107 and cys182. this disulphide bridge was maintained
during all calculations with the receptor model. the model
was energy refined by the following steps:
1. five hundred steps of steepest descent and 1500 of conjugate gradient energy minimisation of the loops and terminals keeping the helices at fixed positions.
2. five hundred steps of steepest descent and 1500 of conjugate gradient energy minimisation of all the side chains in
the model keeping the backbone atoms fixed.
3. fifty ps of md simulation on the loops and terminals, keeping the helices fixed.
4. fifty ps of md simulations of all the side chains, keeping
the backbone atom fixed.
5. five hundred steps of steepest descent and 1500 steps of
conjugate gradient minimisation of the entire receptor
model.
the refined model was used for ligand docking and md
simulations of receptor–ligand interactions. the grasp program was used to calculate the water accessible surface and
the relative electrostatic potential outside the surface of the
 xxxg656xxx .
5.2. modelling of ligands
the ligand structures are shown in fig. 2. molecular
mechanical parameters were obtained by analogy with standard amber force field parameters [38] using the web service “amber parameters by analogy” [44]. a rms difference for the norm of the energy gradient between successive
steps of 0.02 kcal/mol per å was used as convergence criteria
for energy minimisation of ligand molecules. atomic restrained electrostatic potential (resp) charges [45] were calculated for the ligand molecules using a 6-31g* basis set.
the crystal structures of haloperidol [46] and clozapine
[47] were obtained from the cambridge structural database.
an initial model of melperone was constructed from the crystal structure of haloperidol, while the initial structure of  xxxd2511xxx  was constructed from the crystal structure of clozapine. the coordinates and resp charges for dopamine were
obtained from a previous study [48].

5.3. ligand docking and md simulations
of receptor–ligand interactions
the typical antipsychotic drugs, haloperidol and  xxxd2511xxx , the atypical antipsychotic drugs, clozapine and melperone, and the agonist dopamine were docked at putative binding sites in the receptor. for amine gpcrs the binding site of
small molecules is within the transmembrane helical bundle.
the sequence homology with rhodopsin is quite low also for
this part of the receptor, and ligand binding predictions based
only upon the rhodopsin template are relatively uncertain.
therefore, ligand docking into amine gpcr models must be
performed very carefully with as many controls as possible.
automatic docking and scoring functions derived from
empirical fits to an array of simplified energy terms capturing
the key contribution to ligand–protein binding are extremely
fast for screening of ligand binding modes to high resolution
protein structures. due to a compromise between accuracy
and computational speed such docking methods also have
limitations, and especially when the protein structure is not
at a detailed level. a large amount of information about ligand
binding to family a of gpcrs is derived from site-directed
mutagenesis studies available in a searchable form at the
tgrap database (http://www-grap.fagmed.uit.no). in the
present study, we have therefore used an approach where
manual docking was guided by information from sitedirected mutagenesis studies and short docking simulations
with both the receptor and the ligand free to move.
structurally similar parts of the ligands where oriented in
similar positions in the receptor model. several docking positions were considered, and the three positions of each ligand
(four of dopamine) giving strongest receptor interactions were
examined in detail.
these receptor–ligand complexes were energy minimised, and refined by 30 ps of md simulation. the temperature was gradually heated from 0 to 300 k during the md.
after 30 ps, the following criteria were used to select among
the complexes for further md simulations: 1. interaction
energy between the ligand and receptor. 2. complementarity
in shape and electrostatic potentials between the ligand and
the receptor. 3. results of experimental site-directed mutagenesis experiments.
the molecular system obtained after 30 ps of heating was
equilibrated by 120 ps of md followed by a 600 ps simulation where coordinates were sampled every 5th ps, giving a
total simulation time of 750 ps. an average structure was calculated from all coordinates collected during the final 600 ps
of each simulation. for comparison, a corresponding simulation was also performed for the receptor without a ligand.
the average receptor structures were refined by 500 steps
of steepest descent energy minimisation followed by
2000 steps of conjugate gradient minimisation, and the rms
deviation of specific receptor domains from the average structure during the final 600 ps of md was calculated. the interaction energy between the ligands and the receptor, the potential energy of the ligand-receptor complex, and the potential

193

energy of the receptor alone, were calculated for each of the
energy minimised complexes.
