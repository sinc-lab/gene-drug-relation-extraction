summary. concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (csf)

and plasma of  xxxd283xxx  and its active metabolite, the
 xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline, were measured in
man after four once-daily doses of 30 mg  xxxd283xxx  hydrochloride ( xxxd283xxx ®). nine patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery under spinal anaesthesia completed the
study.
the concentrations of both substances were much lower
in csf than in plasma, the ratio csf/plasma being 0.09 for
 xxxd283xxx  and 0.19 for terbutaline, at apparent steady
state. while the rank order of the ratios was expected from
the fractions of unbound  xxxd283xxx  and terbutaline in
plasma, their absolute values were only about 1/6 ( xxxd283xxx ) and 1/4 (terbutaline) of those predicted from diffusion equilibria between plasma and csf.
thus, the rates of transport of  xxxd283xxx  and terbutaline
from plasma into the central nervous system appear to be
slow relative to transport out of the system, e. g. by outflow
of cse the findings are in agreement with animal experiments and suggest that  xxxd283xxx  and terbutaline are
less likely than lipophilic  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor agonists to interact with central receptors.

4% of that in plasma [caccia and fong 1983]. in dogs,
0.5 h after intravenous administration, the concentration
of salbutamol in the brain was not quantifiable, implying
that the concentration was less than 8 % of that in plasma.
under the same dosing and sampling conditions, however,
the lipophilic  xxxd752xxx -agonist clenbuterol had considerable access to the cns, reaching 0.7-times the plasma concentration [saux et al. 1986]. this could explain why clenbuterol
is able to exert an effect on central fl-adrenergic receptors
[o'donnell 1988].
the polar resorcinol hydroxyl groups of terbutaline are
blocked in  xxxd283xxx , which makes the latter more lipophilic [svensson and tunek 1988]; e.g. the solubility of
 xxxd283xxx  hydrochloride in chloroform is as high as
180 g-1-1.  xxxd283xxx  hydrochloride is still very soluble in
water (260 g. 1-1); even at a ph well above its pk~ (about
9.5) the solubility is as high as about 10 g. 1-1, i.e., 25 mm
(astra draco ab, substance specifications).  xxxd283xxx 
should be regarded, therefore, as an amphophilic subterbutaline

 xxxd283xxx  ( xxxd283xxx  ®) is the inactive bisdimethylcarbamate prodrug of the  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline
(bricanyl®; fig. 1). terbutaline is formed by the metabolism of  xxxd283xxx  by plasma cholinesterase ( xxxg248xxx ,  xxxg248xxx ) [tunek et al. 1988] and mixed
function oxidases [svensson and tunek 1988]. terbutaline
is polar and is very soluble in water [martindale extra
pharmacopoeia 1989]. autoradiographic studies in mice
indicate that the distribution of terbutaline into the central nervous system (cns) is negligible [bodin et al. 1972];
similar observations have been made for the hydrophilic
 xxxd752xxx -agonist  xxxd2098xxx  in the rat [kramer and klingspohr
1974]. direct measurement of salbutamol, also a hydrophilic  xxxd752xxx -agonist [jeppsson et al. 1989], in rats showed a
time-averaged concentration in the brain that was only

materials and methods
the study was approved by the local ethics committee. at the time
the study was undertaken, the chosen dose ( xxxd283xxx  hydrochloride 30 mg once daily) was regarded as therapeutically relevant
and was being used in clinical trials. fifteen patients scheduled for
orthopaedic surgery under spinal anaesthesia were recruited for the
study of whom nine (4 men and 5 women) completed it. the latter
group were 50-82 y old (mean 70 y), and weighed 49-103 kg (mean
68 kg). general health was assessed, and concomitant and preanaesthetic medication was noted. of the patients completing the study,
no. 6 was regularly taking levothyroxin, no, 9 used terodiline,  xxxd2146xxx , and trimethoprim plus paracetamol when needed, no. 13 was
taking paracetamol and dextropropoxyphene. before surgery all patients were given dixyrazine, 1020 rag, and patients < 70 y were premedicated with pethidine (1 mg/kg bw). patient 15 had a prophylactic dose of of a short-chain dextran. two patients (nos. 2 and 3) suffered from obstructive lung disease. patients with significant cardiac
disease, inadequately controlled hyperthyroidism or insulin-dependent diabetes were not included.
each evening on the 4 days preceding the day of surgery, the patients took 30 mg (75 gmol) of racemic  xxxd283xxx  hydrochloride
(bambectablets 10 + 20 mg). other bronchodilators were excluded
during the study. samples of plasma and csf were collected 9-15 h
after the last (4th) dose (taken at 22.00 h).

sampling
kambam et al. (1989) found that the  xxxg248xxx  activity
of human csf was very low. we corroborated the observation by adding  xxxd283xxx  to human csf without finding biotransformation

of  xxxd283xxx  to terbutaline. none-the-less, a solution of a  xxxd283xxx  analogue was added to all csf samples as an esterase inhibitor to protect against the possibility of blood (plasma cholin esterase) contamination at sampling.
in conjunction with dural puncture for spinal anaesthesia before
surgery, a 5 ml sample of csf was collected in a sedimentation tube
containing 50 gl of the esterase inhibitor solution (1 ram). at approximately the same time, a 10 ml blood sample was collected in a
na-heparinised tube (venoject®) containing 100 gl inhibitor solution. the tubes were turned upside down 7 times. tubes containing
csf and separated plasma were immediately frozen (-20°c) and
stored.

analysis
all samples were analysed in one sequence at astra draco ab.
 xxxd283xxx  in plasma was measured non-stereospecificallyby a gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) method; limit of
quantitation (loq) 1 nmol. 111 within-day coefficient of variation
(cv) 4.4% [lindberg et al. 1990]. the method was validated for
 xxxd283xxx  in csf. the loq was found to be the same as for plasma
samples and a plasma standard curve could be used in the analysis.
the cv and deviation from the plasma standard curve for the csf
analyses were 3.9 % and + 3.1%, respectively, at 4 nmol. f1.
terbutaline in plasma was measured non-stereospecifically by
hplc with electrochemical detection; loq 4 nmol. 1-1,within-day
cv 2.1% at 8 nmol. v [kennedy et al. 1987]. the hplc method
was validated for the measurement of terbutaline in csf. values of
spiked samples of terbutaline in csf, analysed against a plasma
standard curve, were well within the limits of error of the method.

of the substances measured, terbutaline has the
longest terminal halfqife, on average 17 h [nyberg 1984,
1986]. the 4-day treatment represents, therefore, at least
four half-lives, and should have produced virtual steadystate conditions, implying the attainment of equilibrium
between plasma and other tissues, including the cns. for
ethical and practical reasons we could not confirm the
attainment of a steady state by repeating the sampling
procedure.
if only diffusion across the capillary endothelium governed the concentration of a drug at equilibrium between
plasma and cns, the csf/plasma concentration ratio
should equal the fraction of unbound-to-total plasma concentration (fu) of the drug, because the protein content of
cns fluids is low [guyton 1986]. the fu of  xxxd283xxx  was
determined by ultrafiltration of tritium-labelled drug
added to fresh plasma from 2 men and 2 women. at a
therapeutically relevant concentration (20 nmol.l-1), fu
was found to be 0.5-0.6. for terbutaline an f~ of 0.8 has
been reported [ryrfeldt and ramsay, 1984]. the
csf/plasma concentration ratios found were only about
16 % ( xxxd283xxx ) and 24% (terbutaline) of those predicted from these fu-values. thus, diffusion alone cannot
explain the findings. active transport cannot be excluded,
but it seems unlikely because of the specific character of
carrier-mediated mechanisms in the brain. however, the
continuous production and outflow of csf, being about
500 ml per day [guyton 1986], might be high enough to
disturb the predicted diffusion equilibrium if the latter
were to be slowly established.
at steady state, the ratio between the free concentrations of drug in csf and plasma (ccsf and cp) may be described by [collins and dedrick 1983]:
ccsv
pa
clearanceinward
fu"cf - pa + qcsf - clearanceoutward

(1)

pa is a clearance reflecting diffusion and is therefore assumed to be the same in both directions over the capillary
walls; qcsf is the outflow of csf through the arachnoid
villi. the equation assumes that freshly produced csf
contains no drug. by use of a q c s v of 500 ml per day and
provided that a steady state has been attained, equation 1
allows estimation of a pa of about 100 ml per day for  xxxd283xxx , and about 155 ml per day for terbutaline. these
values are only 3-5 % of the value of 3 litres per day calculated for free diffusion limited by the blood perfusion rate
[collins and dedrick 1983]. thus, a considerable barrier
to penetration into the cns appears to exist for  xxxd283xxx  and terbutaline; the smaller pa-value for  xxxd283xxx 
may reflect the bulkier molecule.
a second sample to confirm steady state between plasma and csf could not be justified, but from the calculated
clearances and the volume of cse about 150 ml [guyton
1986], inward and outward half-lives can be estimated:
ln2-150
tl/2- clearance

(2)

since the estimated values of pa for  xxxd283xxx  and
terbutaline were much smaller than the outflow of csf,
equation 2 shows that the inward half-lives would be the

longest: about 1 day for  xxxd283xxx  and about 16 h for
terbutaline. the longest half-lives will determine the attainment of steady state. because sampling was performed 3.5 days after the first dose, the calculated halflives indicate that both substances would have reached
>_90 % of their final equilibrium. the assumption of
steady state, therefore, appears justified.
a comparison of distribution to the csf can be made
with salbutamol, a hydrophilic substance with low plasma
protein binding - 8 % has been reported in man ]morgan
et al. 1986] - and thus an fu of a similar magnitude to that
of terbutaline. in rats only 4 % [caccia and fong 1983] and
in dogs less than 8 % [saux et al. 1986] of the concentration of salbutamol in plasma was found in the brain. on
the contrary, despite having a small fu - protein binding
being > 90 % in man [yamamoto et al 1985] - the lipophilic  xxxd752xxx -agonist clenbuterol showed a concentration in
dog brain as high as 70 % of the concentration in plasma
already 0.5 h after intravenous adminstration [saux et al.
1986], implying easy passage into the cns fluids plus distribution into solid brain tissue.
in conclusion, the low concentrations of  xxxd283xxx  and terbutaline in cerebrospinal fluid from man
in comparison with the values calculated from the diffusion equilibria of unbound substances indicate slow
penetration of these substances into the central nervous system. the results agree with autoradiographic
findings and, for terbutaline, with other studies of hydrophilic  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor agonists in rats and dogs. there
appears to be less likelihood of  xxxd283xxx  and terbutaline than for lipophilic agonists to interact with central
receptors.
