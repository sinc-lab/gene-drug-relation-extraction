current implications of cyclophilins in human
cancers
review

jinhwa lee1 and sung soo kim*2

abstract
cyclophilins (cyps), the intracellular receptor for immunosuppressant  xxxd1781xxx  (csa), play important cellular roles through activities of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
isomerase ( xxxg798xxx   xxxg799xxx   xxxg1809xxx   xxxg1810xxx ) and chaperones. cyps are structurally
conserved and found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
organisms, including humans which contain 16 cyp isoforms. although human cyps were identified about 25
years ago, their physiological and pathological roles have
only been the focus of attention recently because of their
possible involvement in diseases and ailments such as
hiv infection, hepatitis b and c viral infection, atherosclerosis, er stress-related diseases and neurodegenerative diseases, etc. there are reports for upregulated cyps
in many human cancers and there are also strong correlations found between cyps overexpression and malignant
transformation. this review discusses the important and
diverse roles of cyps overexpression in human cancers.
understanding biological functions of cyps will eventually lead to improved strategies for cancer treatment and
prevention.
introduction
cyclophilins (cyps) were initially identified as biological
receptors for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine
a (csa) approximately 25 years ago. later, they were
shown to have  xxxg798xxx 
( xxxg798xxx   xxxg799xxx   xxxg1809xxx   xxxg1810xxx ) enzymatic activity which catalyzes cis-trans
isomerization of peptide bonds preceding proline [1-6].
cyps also possess chaperone activities. these two functions allow cyps to be involved in proper folding of proteins in combination with other proteins. although csa
is an effective inhibitor of cyps, immunosuppressive
activity of csa is not the result of inhibition of the cyps'
activities. rather, the cyp-csa complex accidentally

inhibits calcineurin activity and thereby suppresses t-cell
proliferation by interfering with downstream signal transduction [7].
cyps are highly conserved from e. coli to humans
throughout evolution. a total of 16 cyp isoforms have
been found in humans [8], but 7 major human cyp isoforms, namely hcypa, hcypb, hcypc, hcypd, hcype,
hcyp40, and hcypnk [9], have been well characterized.
they play diverse roles by localizing through unique
domains for particular cellular compartments including
the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum (er), mitochondria
and nucleus. the clinical importance of cyps has been
implicated in diverse pathological conditions including
hiv [10], hepatitis b and c viral infection, atherosclerosis
[11,12], er stress-related diseases such as diabetes, and
neurodegenerative diseases. cyps are also involved in
normal cellular functions of muscle differentiation,
detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ros) [13], and
immune response [14]. their novel and unfamiliar nuclease activity similar to apoptotic endonucleases suggests a
potential role in apoptotic dna degradation. overall
roles of cyps may encompass far more than already
defined functions such as protein folding.
 xxxg1809xxx  overexpression in diverse types of cancer has
been recently reported by many research groups. subsequently, overexpression of other cyps has also been
repeatedly observed in various cancers. although cyps
expression levels and patterns in many cancer types have
been considerably well documented, the precise roles of
cyps in cancer are hardly defined. here, we will discuss
the implications of cyps in cancer biology and particularly give emphasis on  xxxg1809xxx  that has been studied most
extensively in diverse human cancers. better understanding of cyps' function in cancers may divulge their potential applications in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and
treatment.

regulation of  xxxg798xxx  a gene expression in
human cancers
after the initial finding of upregulation of  xxxg1809xxx  in hepatocellular carcinoma [15,16],  xxxg1809xxx  has been reported to
be overexpressed in small cell lung cancer [17-20], pancreatic cancer [21-25], breast cancer [26,27], colorectal
cancer [28-30], squamous cell carcinoma [31,32], melanoma [33], and glioblastoma multiforme [34]. in addition
to  xxxg1809xxx 's automatic malregulation in diverse cancers,
 xxxg1809xxx  can be influenced in its expression by chemotherapeutic agents. independent research groups demonstrated that treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, 5aza-2- xxxd1836xxx  (dac), celecoxib, and 5-fluorouracil
(5-fu), lowers  xxxg1809xxx  expression [[21,29] and [30]]. on
the contrary, our group found that cisplatin causes  xxxg1809xxx 
overexpression and induces resistance to diverse chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin (unpublished data).
upregulation of  xxxg1809xxx  in cancer is not so unusual; yet the
exact mechanisms of transcriptional alteration of  xxxg1809xxx 
in cancer are still elusive.
initially,  xxxg1809xxx  gene together with those of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, rrna and  xxxg53xxx 
was considered one of the constitutively expressed housekeeping genes which do not respond to external stimuli.
considering the chaperone activity of  xxxg1809xxx  protein, it is
not surprising to find up-regulation of  xxxg1809xxx  gene in
response to stresses that can cause protein damage or
denaturation [35]. since molecular regulatory mechanisms of  xxxg1809xxx  expression are poorly understood, it needs
to be further studied whether the  xxxg1809xxx  up-regulaion in
cancer is controlled by the same regulatory mechanisms
of stress induction.
if up-regulation of  xxxg1809xxx  in cancers is linked to p53 and
 xxxg1048xxx , most well-characterized cancer-related transcriptional regulatory factors, has been sought by several
groups. choi et al. demonstrated that  xxxg1048xxx  can upregulate  xxxg1809xxx  by  xxxg1048xxx  binding to hypoxia response elements (hre) in the  xxxg1809xxx  promoter region under hypoxic
conditions [36]. similarly, gu et al. first showed that
 xxxg1809xxx  is up-regulated during p53-induced apoptosis
using quantitative proteomic profiling [37,38]. they also
proposed that transcription of  xxxg1809xxx  might be induced by
activated p53. while no direct evidence has been
reported that p53 is activated or stabilized by  xxxg1809xxx , it is
interesting to note that pin 1, another type of ppiases,
stabilizes p53 through affinity binding of pin 1 to the
p53's proline rich domain (prd) [39]. our group recently
discovered binding activity of  xxxg1809xxx  to p53 which leads to
stabilization of p53 (unpublished data).

advantage of  xxxg1809xxx  overexpression toward cancer devel-

opment. while the exact roles of  xxxg1809xxx  in cancer cells are
yet to be defined, understanding the precise function of
 xxxg1809xxx  during tumor development will be critical to assess
its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
positive growth effect by excessive  xxxg1809xxx  on cancer
cells was first reported by howard et al. they showed
that overexpression of  xxxg1809xxx  in small cell lung cancer
stimulates cancer cell growth, and knockdown of  xxxg1809xxx 
slows cancer cell growth, independent of its effects on
angiogenesis [17,18]. other roles of  xxxg1809xxx  have also been
proposed. qi et al. suggested that  xxxg1809xxx  is upregulated
during malignant tansformation of esophageal squamous
cells [32].  xxxg1809xxx  abundance is more than 5 fold, compared
to non-malignant immortalized control cell lines [40].
there also exist reports that  xxxg1809xxx  may regulate metastasis [32,33].
during development of solid tumors, ros are continuously generated in tumor's central hypoxic region. hong
et al. suggested that  xxxg1809xxx  has antioxidant effects through
its  xxxg798xxx   xxxg799xxx   xxxg1809xxx   xxxg1810xxx  activity [13]. it is consistent with the finding
that  xxxg1809xxx  overexpression promotes cancer cell proliferation and blocks apoptosis induced by hypoxia [36]. choi
et al. showed that overexpression of  xxxg1809xxx  in cancer cells
renders resistance to hypoxia- and cisplatin-induced cell
death in a p53 independent manner [36].
there are several reports suggesting that inhibition of
 xxxg798xxx   xxxg799xxx   xxxg1809xxx   xxxg1810xxx  activity of  xxxg1809xxx  may generate potential chemotherapeutic effects. yurchenko et al. has reported that cell
surface expression of cd147, tumor cell-derived collagenase stimulatory factor, is regulated by  xxxg1809xxx  [41,42].
overexpressed  xxxg1809xxx  interacts with the proline-containing peptide in cd147's transmembrane domain and stimulates human pancreatic cancer cell proliferation [43].
zheng et al. also demonstrated in breast cancer cells that
prolactin needs to bind  xxxg1809xxx  for cancer progression and
tumor metastasis [44]. han et al. showed that csa and
sanglifehrin a (sfa), two  xxxg1809xxx  inhibitors, increase chemotherapeutic effect of cisplatin in glioblastoma multiforme [34]. overexpression and known functional roles
of  xxxg1809xxx  in various cancer types are summarized in table
1.

other cyclophilins and cancers
other cyps including  xxxg1810xxx ,  xxxg1811xxx ,  xxxg1812xxx  and cyp40
might also play important roles in carcinogenesis. kim et
al. reported that  xxxg1810xxx  protects cells against er stressinduced cell death at least partly through blocking the
ca2+ leakage from er to cytosol [45]. overexpression of
 xxxg1810xxx  is associated with tumor progression through regulation of  xxxg1603xxx  expression and gene products
involved in cell proliferation and motility [46]. interestingly,  xxxg1810xxx  possesses two antigenic epitopes ( xxxg1810xxx  (8292) and  xxxg1810xxx  (91-99)) recognized by hla-a24restricted and tumor-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes

that are suggested to be used for vaccines against cancers
[47].
 xxxg1811xxx  is another cyp family member that is primarily
located in er, but its role remains to be determined.
 xxxg1811xxx  can form a complex with the cooh-terminal fragment of osteopontin. this complex binds to cd147 to
activate akt1/2 and  xxxg1428xxx  in 4t07 murine breast cancer cells. this cyc- osteopontin complex regulates in
vitro migration and invasion properties of 4t1 and 4t07
breast cancer cells [48].
 xxxg1812xxx  is an important component of the mitochondrial
permeability transition pore, another components of
which are the voltage-dependent outer membrane anion
channel, adenine nucleotide translocator [49,50], and
hexokinase.  xxxg798xxx   xxxg799xxx   xxxg1809xxx   xxxg1810xxx  activity of  xxxg1812xxx  may be necessary for
binding of  xxxg1812xxx  to the mptp complex [51]. although
function of  xxxg1812xxx  in mitochondria is controversial, overexpression of  xxxg1812xxx  attenuates sensitivity of hek 293 and
rat glioma c6 cells to apoptotic stimuli, with protective
effects of  xxxg1812xxx  requiring  xxxg798xxx   xxxg799xxx   xxxg1809xxx   xxxg1810xxx  activity [52]. consistently, several reports have shown that  xxxg1812xxx  is overexpressed and has an anti-apoptotic effect in various
tumors via a bcl 2 collaborator and an inhibitor of  xxxg569xxx  release from mitochondria [53]. this protective
effect is independent of the mptp [53].
cyp40 mrna has also been reported to increase in
many breast cancer cell lines including mcf-7 [54].
additionally, cyp40 mrna also increases in response to
high temperature stress in mcf-7 cells [55]. up-regulation of cyp40 is reported to be correlated with oxidative
stress in mcf-7 cells and prostate cancer cell lines.
genetic analysis of breast cancers shows 30% allelic loss
of cyp40 from patients heterozygous for cyp40 [56].
overexpression and potential roles for other cyps in various cancer types are summarized in table 2.

summary
cyps regulate protein folding through  xxxg798xxx   xxxg799xxx   xxxg1809xxx   xxxg1810xxx  enzymatic
and chaperone activities in specific locales of the cells to
ensure correct conformation and to counterbalance conformational variations under diverse stress conditions. in
addition to  xxxg798xxx   xxxg799xxx   xxxg1809xxx   xxxg1810xxx  and chaperone activities, each isoform
of cyps has other specific intracellular and extracellular
roles. although roles of cyps have recently been explored
in more details, many physiological and pathological
aspects of cyps' biology still remain unclear.
 xxxg1809xxx  among the cyps was first reported to be upregulated in tumors, including small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, squamous
cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and melanoma.
this wide spectrum of cancers harboring excess  xxxg1809xxx 
denotes an important role of  xxxg1809xxx  in tumor development. the possible roles of  xxxg1809xxx  in cancers might
involve increased cell proliferation, blockage of apoptosis,
malignant transformation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. transcriptional
upregulation of  xxxg1809xxx  mediated by p53 and  xxxg1048xxx  during tumor development would magnify the cancer-prone
effect of  xxxg1809xxx .
some groups have proposed  xxxg1809xxx  as a cancer biomarker for certain cancer subtypes because expression
levels nicely correlate with tumor progression. although
less informed at now, other cyps are also known to be
overexpressed and proposed to be involved in various
cancers.
csa and sfa induce apoptosis in various cancer cells
via inhibition of  xxxg798xxx   xxxg799xxx   xxxg1809xxx   xxxg1810xxx  activity of cyps, and have been
tested for clinical applications in diverse cancer types
[34]. however, csa and sfa can hardly be applied to cancer patients because of immunosuppressive effects. the

suppressive effects will be promising for the treatment of
cancers currently resistant to available chemotherapeutics.
