effect of ergot alkaloids on 3h-flunitrazepam binding to mouse brain gabaa receptors.  in vitro effects of dihydroergotoxine, dihydroergosine, dihydroergotamine, alpha-dihydroergocriptine (ergot alkaloids), diazepam, methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxilate (beta-ccm), flumazenil (benzodiazepines), gamma-amino butyric acid (gaba) and thiopental (barbiturate) were studied on mouse brain (cerebrum minus cerebral cortex) benzodiazepine binding sites labeled with 3h-flunitrazepam. specific, high affinity (affinity constant, kd = 57.7 8.6 nm) binding sites for 3h-flunitrazepam on mouse brain membranes were identified. all benzodiazepine drugs inhibited 3h-flunitrazepam binding with nanomolar potencies. in contrast to benzodiazepines, all ergot drugs, gaba and thiopental produced an enhancement of 3h-flunitrazepam binding to its binding site at the gabaa receptor of the mouse brain. the rank order of potency was: neurotransmitter (gaba) > dihydroergotoxine > thiopental > alpha-dihydroergocriptine > dihydroergosine > dihydroergotamine. the results suggest that dihydrogenated ergot derivatives do not bind to the brain benzodiazepine binding sites labeled with 3h-flunitrazepam. however, an enhancement of 3h-flunitrazepam binding by all ergot drugs tested, clearly identifies an allosteric interaction with the benzodiazepine binding sites of gabaa receptors.
