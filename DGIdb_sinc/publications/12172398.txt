purpose: the effect of gemfibrozil is mediated by the activation of  xxxg1805xxx 
(ppar␣). the objective of this study was to determine whether the lipid response to gemfibrozil therapy is
influenced by the ppar␣-l162v polymorphism. methods: sixty-three abdominally obese men were randomly
assigned to a 6-month-intervention program with either receiving a placebo (n ⫽ 31) or gemfibrozil (n ⫽ 32).
results: in response to gemfibrozil therapy, l162-homozygotes exhibited a 5.5% increase in high-density lipoprotein 2 cholesterol (hdl2-c) levels compared with a 50.0% increase among carriers of the v162 allele (p ⫽ 0.03).
conclusion: these results suggest that the hdl2-c response to gemfibrozil is modulated by the ppar␣-l162v
polymorphism. genet med 2002:4(4):311–315.

alterations of the lipoprotein-lipid profile are associated
with an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease, the
leading cause of death in westernized societies. many lipidlowering agents have been developed for the treatment of dyslipidemia. in this regard, the clinical benefits of gemfibrozil, a
fibrate agent, have been reported in both primary1 and secondary2 prevention trials. although fibrates have been used in clinical practice for more then three decades, their molecular
mechanism of action has just recently been elucidated3, and it
is now recognized that their effects are mediated by the activation of a specific nuclear receptor termed  xxxg1805xxx  (ppar␣). the activation of
ppar␣ by fibrates causes the transactivation of ppar␣-responsive genes, which include those encoding proteins that
control lipid metabolism.3
recently, a molecular scanning of the human ppar␣ has
revealed a l162v polymorphism associated with alterations of
the lipoprotein-lipid profile.4,5 the frequency for the rare allele
is established to be 0.062 in the healthy european population5
and reaches 0.128 in french-canadians.4 to demonstrate the
functional consequences of this polymorphism, transient
transfection assays in hepa-1 and hepg2 cell lines have been
performed.5,6 both studies have shown enhanced transactivafrom the 1lipid research center, chul research center, 2physical activity sciences laboratory, kinesiology division, department of social and preventive medicine, laval university, quebec, canada; 3department of kinesiology, university of montreal, montreal, canada; 4human kinetics, faculty of health sciences, university of ottawa, ontario, canada;

tion activity in cells containing vectors expressing ppar␣v162 allele, compared with l162 allele, when treated with the
ppar␣ ligand wy-14,643. in this context, it was interesting to
verify whether the l162v polymorphism in the ppar␣ gene
can modulate the plasma lipoprotein/lipid response to
gemfibrozil.

materials and methods
subjects

subjects were asymptomatic, nondiabetic volunteers who
had to fulfill the following criteria. men had to be between 25
and 55 years of age and willing to participate to a 6-month
intervention program in which they were asked to follow the
national cholesterol education program phase 1 dietary
guidelines with or without gemfibrozil. experience from the
helsinki heart study revealed that the effect of gemfibrozil was
largely confined to overweight subjects.7 men in the present
study were weight stable obese (27 and 40 kg/m2) and characterized by a dyslipidemic state (1.7 mmol/l ⱖ tg ⱕ 5.7
mmol/l; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) ⱕ 1.2
mmol/l and total plasma cholesterol ⬍ 6.7 mmol/l). the
study was approved by the medical ethics committee of laval
university. all subjects gave their informed written consent to
participate in this study.
study design

after having completed their baseline measurements, 71
subjects were selected to participate to the study and were randomly assigned to either receiving a placebo or gemfibrozil 600
mg bid. dietary recommendations were given by a registered
dietician on a voluntary basis for the duration (6 months) of
the study. drug safety was assessed every 4 weeks by the phy311

bossé et al.
sician in charge of the project. subjects were tested at baseline
and at the end of the 6-month intervention protocol. during
that period, there were six dropouts, and genotype information was not available for two subjects. we thus ended-up with
a total of 63 subjects who completed the trial.
lipids and lipoproteins

fasting blood samples were collected and plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein (apo) levels were measured as
previously described.8 hdl2 was precipitated from the hdl
fraction with  xxxd1860xxx .9 the cholesterol content of the
supernatant fraction (hdl3) was determined, and hdl2-c
levels were derived by subtracting hdl3-c from total hdl-c
concentrations. nondenaturing 4% to 30% polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis was performed for the measurement of the average hdl size using whole plasma kept at ⫺80°c as recently
described.10 the same plasma were also used to determine the
low-density lipoprotein (ldl) peak particle size measured by
electrophoresis on a 2% to 16% polyacrylamide gradient gel as
previously described.11,12
dna analysis

the l162v polymorphism does not alter any restriction site.
a mismatch polymerase chain reaction method previously described was used to genotype all the subjects participating in
the study.4
statistical analyses

variables not normally distributed were log10 transformed
before analysis. the difference in response between genotype
groups was assessed by a two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test.
to evaluate whether the ppar␣-l162v genotype may interact
with gemfibrozil treatment, we performed an anova in
which the interaction term was included (two-way factorial
anova). the source of variation in lipoprotein-lipid profile
was computed using the type iii sum of squares. this sum of
squares applies to unbalanced study designs and quantifies the
effects of an independent variable after adjustment for all other
variables included in the model. all statistical analyses were
performed using the sas package (sas institute, cary, nc),
and a statistically significant difference was defined as p ⬍ 0.05.

results
among the 63 men who completed the study, 31 were assigned to the placebo group and 32 to the gemfibrozil group.
the effects of the 6-month-intervention program on plasma
lipoprotein/lipid profile have been published elsewhere.8 in
the present study, the placebo and gemfibrozil groups were
further subdivided on the basis of the ppar␣-l162v genotype
(fig. 1).
the baseline lipoprotein-lipid profile according to the
ppar␣-l162v genotype is presented in table 1. for these
analyses, subjects in the placebo and gemfibrozil groups were
combined because medication had not started. no statistically
significant difference was observed between the two genotype

a

greater increase in ldl size observed in v162 allele carriers
although the difference did not reach statistical significance.
when individual hdl-c responses to gemfibrozil were
plotted (fig. 3), two phenomena were noted. first, there was a
large interindividual variation in hdl-c changes with gemfibrozil therapy. second, there was a cluster of carriers of the
v162-allele on the right side of the graph, indicating a greater
increase of hdl-c levels among these individuals. in these
individuals, the apparent difference in plasma hdl-c levels
was mainly explained by changes in the hdl2-c subfraction as
no difference was observed between the genotype groups regarding the change in the hdl3-c subfraction (fig. 2). subsequent analyses performed in men treated with gemfibrozil revealed that after the 6-month-intervention program, v162
carriers were characterized by higher levels of hdl2-c compared with l162-hmz (fig. 4).
to test the potential interaction between the ppar␣-l162v
polymorphism and gemfibrozil treatment on plasma lipoprotein-lipid concentrations, an analysis of variance was performed for each lipoprotein-lipid variable. the effects of the
genotype and the treatment, as well as the potential interaction
between these two independent variables, are presented in table 3. as expected, the treatment (placebo versus gemfibrozil)
had a statistically significant impact on plasma lipoproteinlipid changes. on the other hand, the ppar␣-l162v genotype
by itself did not have a significant impact on plasma lipoprotein-lipid responses. however, a significant genotype-by-treatment interaction was observed for changes in plasma hdl2-c
levels. this interaction explained 7.0% of the total variance of
the change in plasma hdl2-c concentrations. this finding
suggests that the ppar␣-l162v polymorphism may influence
plasma hdl2-c responsiveness to gemfibrozil therapy. additionally, it also implies that men carrying the ppar␣-v162
allele will experience a higher increase in hdl2-c levels when
treated with fibrates.

discussion
the documented interindividual variation in the response
to fibrate therapy is clinically relevant. in this report, we demonstrated that a naturally occurring variation, l162v, in the
ppar␣ gene is associated with greater responsiveness of
hdl2-c levels after a 6-month-therapy with gemfibrozil. before this study, flavell et al.5 had reported a greater lowering
effect of  xxxd331xxx  on total cholesterol and non-hdl-c in
314

v162 carriers. in the present study, there was a trend toward
higher increase in hdl-c levels after the administration of
gemfibrozil, but it did not reach statistical significance. taken
together, these results suggest potentially greater benefits of
fibrate treatment among individuals carrying the ppar␣v162 allele. this could be of great interest as previous work
suggests that the ppar␣-l162v polymorphism seems to have
a deleterious impact on plasma lipoprotein-lipid levels.4,5,13
ppar␣ regulates the expression of gene encoding proteins
that control lipoprotein metabolism. in vitro studies performed on hepatic cells (hepg2 and hepa-1) have demonstrated higher transactivation activity in ppar␣ carrying the
v162 allele when treated with a ppar␣ agonist.5,6 differences
observed in hdl2-c responsiveness in the present study could
then be explained by a greater transcriptional regulation of
ppar␣ target genes in subjects carrying the v162 allele. several
proteins controlling hdl metabolism are regulated at the gene
level by ppar␣ activators such as fibrates. in fact, fibrate therapy has been shown to induce overexpression of apo a-i and
apo a-ii genes, leading to an increase in plasma hdl-c levels.14,15 recently, other proteins such as atp-binding cassette
transporter 1 and cd36- and limpii-analogous 1/scavenger
receptor class b type 1 involved in the reverse-cholesteroltransport pathway have been shown to be up-regulated by
ppar␣ activators in macrophages.16,17 furthermore, it has
been demonstrated in mice that fibrate treatment increases
 xxxg1782xxx  gene expression through a
ppar␣-dependent mechanism, which accounts for a marked
enlargement of hdl particles.18 the functional consequence
of the ppar␣-l162v polymorphism could result in higher
transcriptional regulation of genes controlling hdl metabolism and then explain the relationship between the ppar␣l162v polymorphism and the hdl2-c response to gemfibrozil observed in the present study.
this study reported associations that make biological sense
and study genetic variations that affect the gene product in a
physiologically meaningful way. however, certain limitations
may give some uncertainty about our results. first, dealing
with the low frequency of the polymorphism and with a small
sample size impaired our ability to recognize association with a
smaller effect. second, considering the multiple comparisons
made in the study, some of the significant findings may have
occurred by chance. consequently, further studies with a
larger sample size are warranted to determine the interest of
the ppar␣ l162v polymorphism in the management of
dyslipidemia.
in summary, we have demonstrated that subjects carrying
the ppar␣-v162 allele showed higher increases in hdl2-c
levels in response to gemfibrozil therapy. this finding could be
of clinical relevance for these individuals as a low concentration of the hdl2 subfraction seems to be more closely related
to the incidence of ischemic heart disease.19,20 we speculate
that the greater hdl2-c increase among gemfibrozil-treated
men carrying the ppar␣-l162v polymorphism is mediated
by a more pronounced transcriptional regulation of genes controlling hdl metabolism.
