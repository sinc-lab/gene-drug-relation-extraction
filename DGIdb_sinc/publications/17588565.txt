abstract
neuromuscular blocking drugs produce muscle weakness by interaction with nicotinic-acetylcholine receptors. cardiovascular side effects
have been reported. in this study the neuromuscular blocking drug vecuronium and the controls  xxxd2174xxx  and pancuronium slowed the rate of
atropine induced [3h]n-methylscopolamine dissociation from chinese hamster ovary cells expressing recombinant human muscarinic m2
receptors koff values min− 1; vecuronium (125 nm), atropine 0.45 ± 0.07 + blocker 0.04 ± 0.02;  xxxd2174xxx  (21 nm), atropine 0.42 ± 0.05 + blocker
0.15 ± 0.04; pancuronium(21 nm), atropine 0.36 ± 0.03 + blocker 0.03 ± 0.01). these data indicate that vecuronium,  xxxd2174xxx  and pancuronium
interact with an allosteric site on the muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  (located on the heart) and this may explain some of their cardiac side effects.

1. introduction
neuromuscular blocking drugs are widely used in anaesthetic
practice to facilitate tracheal intubation and surgery and can be
classified as depolarizing and non-depolarizing. suxamethonium is currently the only clinically used depolarizer where it is
an agonist of the nicotinic-acetylcholine receptor. there are a
wide range of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs
which act as nicotinic receptor antagonists including  xxxd2174xxx , pancuronium and vecuronium (for reviews see  xxxd2561xxx  and
pollard, 1995; bowman 2006). in addition to production of
neuromuscular blockade several neuromuscular blocking drugs
produce adverse cardiovascular actions including tachycardia
( xxxd2174xxx  (kennedy and farman, 1968), pancuronium (parmentier and dagnelie, 1979; stevens et al., 1997)) or bradycardia (vecuronium (lema et al., 1992; stevens et al., 1997)) and

this may result from an interaction with muscarinic acetylcholine
receptors due to the structural similarity to acetylcholine.
we have previously shown that several neuromuscular
blocking drugs interact with human muscarinic m2 receptors
expressed in rat heart (appadu and lambert, 1994) and chinese
hamster ovary (chohm2) cells (cembala et al., 1998). in particular  xxxd2174xxx , pancuronium and vecuronium displaced [3h]
n-methylscopolamine ([3h]-nms) from chohm2 cells with ki
values of 21 nm, 21 nm and 125 nm. in addition  xxxd2174xxx  and
pancuronium were at least 7 fold m2 selective (relative to the
remaining muscarinic m1, m3–5 subtypes). vecuronium was
around 3 fold m4 selective (cembala et al., 1998). in a series of
functional antagonism experiments using cho cells expressing
human muscarinic m2 receptors, pancuronium but not vecuronium antagonised  xxxd2586xxx  inhibition of camp formation
indicating that the former neuromuscular blocking drug acted as
a muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  antagonist (cembala et al., 1998).
it is well known that the binding of ligands (e.g., [3h]-nms)
to the orthosteric site at the muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  is
influenced by allosteric ligands binding to the allosteric site(s)
(birdsall and lazareno, 2005). binding of an allosteric ligand
can be monitored in kinetic studies by determining the rate of
orthosteric ligand dissociation. in this study we have examined

the effects of the clinical neuromuscular blocking drug
vecuronium and compared this with two well defined control
ligands,  xxxd2174xxx  (largely experimental) and pancuronium
(older clinical neuromuscular blocking drug) on atropine
induced dissociation of [3h]-nms from cho cells expressing
the human muscarinic  xxxg448xxx . as a first step we opted to
use a single concentration of  xxxd2174xxx  (equilibrium displacement ki ) and two concentrations of pancuronium and
vecuronium ki and half ki concentrations).
2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture and membrane preparation
chinese hamster ovary expressing 165 fmol/mg protein of
human muscarinic m2 receptors (chohm2) were maintained in
minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% newborn
calf serum, 100 iu/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin and
2.5 mug/ml  xxxd164xxx  as described previously (cembala et al.,
1998). confluent monolayers were harvested using 0.9% nacl,
10 mm hepes and 0.05% edta, ph 7.4, homogenized using
an ultra-turrax homogenizer then sedimented at 20,000 g/4 °c/
10 min. the homogenization and sedimentation was repeated a
total of three times. membranes were finally resuspended in
buffer of the following composition: 20 mm hepes, 1 mm
mgcl2, ph 7.4. protein was determined according to lowry
et al. (1957).

estimated by non-linear regression curve-fitting (one phase
exponential decay) of specific binding data using graphpad
prism (v3.0) to derive the dissociation rate constant koff). the
effects of the neuromuscular blocker on atropine induced
dissociation were compared using a paired t-test and differences
were considered significant when p ≤ 0.05.
3. results
addition of atropine (10 mum) produced a rapid timedependent dissociation of [3h]-nms from membranes expressing human muscarinic m2 receptors, fig. 1. this dissociation
was essentially complete by 10 min. dissociation rate constant
for [3h]-nms koff) for the entire data set was 0.42 ± 0.03 min− 1
(n = 30). dissociation of [3h]-nms induced by atropine was
significantly slowed by  xxxd2174xxx  (21 nm), fig. 1 (top), pancuronium (21 nm), fig. 1 (middle) and vecuronium (125 nm),
fig. 1 (bottom). similar data were obtained with pancuronium
(11 nm) and vecuronium (62.5 nm). dissociation rate

2.2. [3h]-nms binding assay
approximately 200 mug of chohm2 membranes were
incubated in 1 ml of 20 mm hepes, 1 mm mgcl2, ph 7.4
buffer containing ∼ 0.2 nm [3h]-nms for 60 min at 37 °c to
label receptors to equilibrium. equlibrium was achieved at
45 min (data not shown). at 60 min [3h]-nms dissociation was
initiated by the addition of atropine (10 mum) in the absence and
presence of galamine (21 nm), pancuronium (21 and 11 nm)
and vecuronium (125 and 62.5 nm). a control with no addition
was included in each experiment. binding was terminated by
rapid vacuum filtration onto whatman gf/b filters using a
brandel cell harvester for times up to 30 min. in all experiments
non-specific binding was determined using 10 mum atropine.
filter bound radioligand was measured by standard scintillation
spectroscopy.
2.3. sources of reagents
all cell culture media, reagents and plasticware were from
invitrogen (uk).  xxxd2174xxx , pancuronium and atropine were
from sigma (poole, uk). [3h]-nms (68–85 ci/mmol) was
from amersham (uk). vecuronium was a kind gift from
organon (newhouse uk).
2.4. data analysis
all data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. of at least 5 independent experiments. the rate of [3h]-nms dissociation was

constants, koff, are summarized in table 1. it should be noted
that there was some (∼ 30%) variation in values for atropine
koff. however, each experiment comprised three data sets;
control, atropine and atropine plus neuromuscular blocking
drug. as such all comparisons are on paired data and data are
presented for each neuromuscular blocking drug.
4. discussion
in this study we have shown that  xxxd2174xxx , pancuronium
and vecuronium all slow the rate of atropine induced [3h]-nms
dissociation indicative of an allosteric interaction. these data
complement and extend our previous description of an
interaction of these and several other neuromuscular blocking
drugs with the orthosteric site in a series of equilibrium competition experiments. peak serum (free)  xxxd2174xxx , pancuronium and vecuronium concentrations of 6.53 mum, 245 nm and
61 nm (see cembala et al., 1998, table 3) have been reported
indicating that the allosteric interaction reported here could
occur at clinically achievable concentrations.
allosterism describes the way in which two drugs can bind
to and interact on a receptor without physical contact (kenakin,
1997) and this occurs at many g-protein coupled receptors
(christopoulos and kenakin, 2002; may et al., 2004; gao and
jacobson, 2006). the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is one
of the best characterised (christopoulos et al., 1998; birdsall et
al., 2001; mohr et al., 2003; birdsall and lazareno, 2005;
holzgrabe et al., 2006). the muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  subtype,
referred in the past as the cardiac muscarinic receptor, is particularly sensitive to allosteric modulation (birdsall and
lazareno, 2005).  xxxd2174xxx  (along with the archetypal alcuronium) interacts with the ‘common’ allosteric site on the
muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  where these agents slow the rate of
[3h]-nms dissociation (schroter et al., 2000). jakubik et al.
(1995) showed that alcuronium displayed the following rank
order of affinity for muscarinic receptors expressed in cho
cells: m2 n m4 = m3 n m1 n m5 and that there was a positive
allosteric interaction at muscarinic m2 and m4 receptors. we
have shown that  xxxd2174xxx  displaced [3h]-nms binding to
cho cells expressing the recombinant human muscarinic
receptor with a rank order affinity of m2 n m1 n m4 n m3 n m5
(cembala et al., 1998). in the present study we have reported
allosteric modulation of the muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  by
 xxxd2174xxx  and this confirms the data of trankle et al. (2001)

39

where some selective allosterism for m2 over the m3 receptors
was reported and the following rank order m2 n m4 n
m1 n m3 n m5 was reported by ellis et al. (1991).
there is also evidence for an allosteric interaction of
pancuronium with a crude rat atrial homogenate where high
concentrations (1 and 10 mum but not 200 nm) slowed the rate of
[3h]-nms dissociation induced by unlabelled (9 nm) nms
(gilani et al., 1997). these data are clearly at variance with our
own in that pancuronium as low as 11 nm significantly slowed
[3h]-nms dissociation although this was induced with 10 mum
atropine. the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear but may
relate to the use of a crude atrial preparation, compared to
recombinant receptor population or the use of nms compared
to atropine to induce dissociation. this allosteric action results
in functional receptor antagonism as we have previously reported that pancuronium (300 nm) produced a parallel
rightward (∼ 400×) shift in the concentration response curve
to  xxxd2586xxx  for inhibition of camp formation in chohm2
cells indicative of competitive antagonism yielding a pkb value
of ∼9. this antagonism is consistent with a reported tachycardia produced by pancuronium in the clinical setting (parmentier and danelie, 1979; stevens et al., 1997).
vecuronium is about 3 fold m4 selective over muscarinic m2
receptors in [3h]-nms competition experiments with a relatively consistent 6 fold lower affinity (630–720 nm) for the
remaining muscarinic m1, m3 and m5 (i.e., gq coupled)
receptors (cembala et al., 1998). this neuromuscular blocking
drug also slowed the rate of [3h]-nms dissociation to a degree
similar to that produced by pancuronium even at concentrations
as low as 62.5 nm. however, in functional studies this neuromuscular blocking drug (at 1 mum) did not affect  xxxd2586xxx 
induced inhibition of camp formation (cembala et al., 1998).
this is puzzling but the interaction with muscarinic m2
receptors is clear and we can now define this interaction as
allosteric in nature. further studies are clearly warranted to
probe this interaction further. in the ultimate functional assay
(cardiovascular effects in man) vecuronium has been associated
with bradycardia and cardiac arrest (milligan and beers, 1985;
lema et al., 1992; stevens et al., 1997). the endogenous
agonist for the muscarinic receptor is acetylcholine and not
nms and in the clinical setting the nmbd will be interacting
dynamically with this transmitter. however, both nms and
acetylcholine interact with the orthosteric site.
in summary, we have shown that the neuromuscular
blocking drugs vecuronium,  xxxd2174xxx  and pancuronium are
allosteric modulators of recombinant human muscarinic m2
receptors. whilst this interaction occurs at clinically achievable
concentrations, full concentration response curves for koff and
mechanistic studies are warranted.
