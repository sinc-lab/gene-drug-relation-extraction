abstract
objective: the aim of this study was to assess the
efficacy and tolerability of nebulized  xxxd216xxx  tartrate ca selective, long-acting ~2-adrenergic agonist
that is the [r,r] isomer of  xxxd2155xxx ) and salmeterol
xinafoate versus placebo in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).
methods: this 12-week, multicenter, randomized,
double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and activecontrolled trial was conducted at 60 centers across the
united states. male and female patients aged ___35years
with physician-diagnosed copd received  xxxd216xxx 
(15 lag bid, 25 lag bid, or 50 lag qd via nebulizer), salmeterol (42 lag bid via metered dose inhaler), or placebo.
pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry; dyspnea,
by the transitional dyspnea index (tdi); and health
status, by the st. george's respiratory questionnaire
(sgrq). adverse events (aes) were assessed by site
personnel at all clinic visits (screening, first dose at
week 0, and at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and follow-up). coid
exacerbations were defined as worsening respiratory
status requiring a change in medication or an unscheduled provider visit.
results: a total of 717 patients received study medication. the demographic composition of all treatment
arms was similar. the mean age was 62.9 years, 58%
were men, and mean baseline forced expiratory volume
in 1 second (fev1) was 1.2 l (41% predicted). mean
improvement in trough fev1 over 12 weeks was significantly greater with all 3  xxxd216xxx  doses
(15 lag bid, +16.9%; 25 lag bid, +18.9%; 50 lag qd,
+14.9%) and for salmeterol (+17.4%) relative to placebo (+6.0%; p < 0.001). there were significandy greater
improvements in the mean percentage change in fev1

bid, 12.7%; 25 lag bid, 13.9%; 50 lag qd, 18.9%; salmeterol, 9.8%) versus placebo (2.7%; p _<0.001); all
doses of  xxxd216xxx  were statistically different from
salmeterol for this end point (p _<0.024). at week 12,
tdi focal scores were significantly greater with all  xxxd216xxx  doses compared with placebo (mean [95%
ci]: 15 lag bid, 0.97 [0.25-1.69]; 25 lag bid, 1.08
[0.3-1.86]; 50 lag qd, 1.04 [0.32-1.77]), suggesting
treatment-associated improvement in dyspnea; however, the difference between salmeterol and placebo was
not statistically significant (0.36 [-0.40 to 1.12]). improvements in health status, as measured using sgrq
total scores, were -2.6 to -3.6 u in the  xxxd216xxx 
groups, -4.4 u for salmeterol, and -1.2 u for placebo;
95% ci of differences versus placebo suggested significant improvement for the  xxxd216xxx  25 lag bid and
salmeterol groups. there was a similar frequency of
aes and copd exacerbations across all groups, including placebo.
conclusions: in this trial, patients with moderate to
severe copd administered nebulized  xxxd216xxx  over
12 weeks were observed to have significant and sustained improvements in airway function and dyspnea

introduction
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) affects -24 million people in the united states. 1 the estimated number of patients with copd has increased
by 41.5% since 1982. 2 copd is currently the fourth
leading cause of death in the united states, but is expected to be the third leading cause of death by 2020. 3
bronchodilators, including long-acting ~12-agonists
(labas), are central for symptom management in
copd, 2,4 and improve airway function and other
clinically meaningful outcomes, such as exacerbation
frequency, rescue medication use, and patient-reported
outcomes (eg, dyspnea, health status), s,~
while most available inhaled bronchodilators are administered using metered dose inhalers (mdis) or dry
powder inhalers, there are some patients for whom nebulization may be a preferred route of administration. 7-9
however, until recently, there were no labas formulated as inhalational solutions for use in a nebulizer.
the laba  xxxd216xxx  is the (r,r) isomer of  xxxd2155xxx . 1°,11 in preclinical studies measuring inhibition
of tracheal smooth muscle contraction,  xxxd216xxx 
had 2-fold greater potency compared with  xxxd2155xxx 
and was -100- to 200-fold more potent as a ~l-agonist
than albuterol. 12 in contrast, receptor stimulation,
smooth muscle relaxation, and inhibition of spasmogen response studies 12,13 have found that the (s,s)
isomer of  xxxd2155xxx  was 1000-fold less potent as a
~-agonist than the (r,r) isomer.
in this trial, we assessed the efficacy and tolerability of multiple daily doses of nebulized  xxxd216xxx 
administered for 12 weeks in patients with copd.
patients and methods
this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, doubledummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel group
trial was performed in 60 centers across the united
states. the study was conducted according to us food
and drug administration regulations and guidelines,

262

which encompass the principles established by good clinical practice 14 and the declaration of helsinki and its
amendments, is the institutional review boards for each
of the 60 study sites approved the protocol, and written
informed consent was obtained from each patient.
inclusion and exclusion criteria
eligible patients were 35 years of age and older with
physician-diagnosed copd and had a baseline forced
expiratory volume in i second (fev1) <65% of predicted but fev 1 :,0.70 l, fev1/forced vital capacity ratio
<70%, _>15 pack-year smoking history, and breathlessness severity of >_2 (ie, shormess of breath when hurrying on the level or walking up a slight hill) on the
medical research council dyspnea scale. 1~ patients
who had life-threatening or unstable respiratory status
within 30 days before screening; a diagnosis of asthma
and/or any chronic respiratory disease (including sleep
apnea) other than copd; lung resection :,1 full lobe;
and/or continuous use of supplemental oxygen (unless
they resided at an elevation _>4000 feet [1219.2 m])
were excluded.
the use of other labas and/or anticholinergic medications was prohibited during the study. however,
patients receiving corticosteroids (inhaled or oral), xanthines, or leukotriene antagonists were allowed to continue on these medications provided the dose was stable
for at least 14 days prior to study entry and maintained
throughout the study. leukotriene antagonists and xanthines were withheld for at least 24 hours prior to each
clinic visit.

study design
we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of multiple daily doses of nebulized  xxxd216xxx  (15 lag
bid, 25 pg bid, and 50 pg qd) in comparison with
placebo. salmeterol (42 lag bid) administered by an
mdi was included as an active control.
albuterol mdi and ipratropium mdi were provided as rescue and supplemental medications, respectively, for use as needed throughout the trial including
the single-blind placebo run-in period. patients were
instructed in the use of these medications and told to
withhold them for 6 hours prior to each clinic visit.
after screening, patients entered a 2-week, singleblind placebo run-in period. following the run-in, eligible patients were randomized to receive 12 weeks
of  xxxd216xxx  15 pg bid,  xxxd216xxx  25 pg bid,
 xxxd216xxx  50 pg qd, placebo, or salmeterol mdi
volume 29 number 2

r.a. baumgartner et al.

42 pg bid. in this double-dummy design, patients received one of the active treatments or placebo; and an
inactive unit dose vial or mdi, as appropriate. the
initial dose of study medication was administered on
the day of randomization (at the start of week 0).
patients returned to the clinic every 3 weeks for
follow-up evaluations (at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12).
serial spirometry was performed in all patients before
and then immediately post-first dose, and at 15 and
40 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 23, and
24 hours post-first dose at weeks 0, 6, and 12.
reversibility to racemic albuterol (2 puffs of 90 lag
each, self-administered 15 to 30 minutes prior to testing) was assessed between screening and randomization, but was not an inclusion criterion.

treatments
unit dose vials, supplied by sepracor inc.
(marlborough, massachusetts), contained 2 ml of inhalation solution of  xxxd216xxx  50 lag,  xxxd216xxx 
25 pg,  xxxd216xxx  15 pg, or placebo, administered
using a nebulizer (pari lc plus with dura-neb
3000 compressor, pari respiratory equipment, inc.,
midlothian, virginia). mdi canisters, also supplied
by sepracor inc., delivered salmeterol 42 pg bid
(serevent inhalation aerosol, glaxosmithkline,
research triangle park, north carolina) or matching
placebo bid. patients were instructed in the use of all
devices by clinic personnel during the run-in period.
spacers were permitted for all mdis in patients
who ordinarily received their medication this way.
treatment compliance was assessed from patient
responses on diary cards that were completed on a
daily basis.
study end points
the primary end point was the mean percentage
change (%a) from baseline (prior to the first dose at
week 0) in morning trough fev 1, analyzed over the
12-week double-blind period (adjusted mean from
serial spirometry performed at weeks 0, 6, and 12).
trough fev 1 was the morning value obtained at the
end of the dosing interval (ie, 12 hours after the
evening dose for the bid treatment arms and 24 hours
after the morning dose for the qd treatment arm).
mean %a trough fev 1 was also analyzed separately
at weeks 0, 6, and 12.
the key secondary end point was the mean %a fev 1
auc averaged over time 0 to 12 hours after study drug
february 2007

administration (auc0_12h) measured from visit predose
values. this outcome, a measure of bronchodilation
over the 12 hours after study drug administration, was
analyzed over the 12-week double-blind period and separately at weeks 0, 6, and 12. additional spirometry end
points included: mean peak %a fev 1 from visit predose, mean peak percent predicted fev 1, and mean time
to onset of response (defined as a 10% improvement in
fev 1 from visit predose values), in the 12 hours after
study drug administration.
symptoms and other patient-reported outcomes were
also assessed. parameters assessing rescue and supplemental medication use included the mean changes from
baseline (obtained in the 3-week period prior to dosing) in the number of days of use per week and number of actuations used per day. the baseline dyspnea
index w was assessed prior to dosing at the start of the
run-in period. the transitional dyspnea index (tdi) 17
was assessed at week 12. the st. george's respiratory
questionnaire (sgrq) is was administered at baseline
and at week 6. the sgrq consisted of 3 component
scores (symptoms, activity, and impact) and a total
score. a 6-minute walk distance test 19 was conducted
at the screening visit and at week 9 at 3 to 4 hours after
study drug administration. symptoms assessed on a
subject global evaluation questionnaire (an instrument rating subjective change in status administered at
the screening visit and at week 12), were rated on a
7-point ordinal scale (0 = much better to 6 = much

worse).
protocol-defined copd exacerbations (respiratory
adverse events [aes] or symptoms leading to changes
in baseline medication or unscheduled medical visits)
were assessed. additional tolerability end points included aes and cardiovascular outcomes (including
mean a heart rate [hr] and corrected qt interval by
fridericia's formula [qtc-f] at 2 hours after study
drug administration measured by electrocardiography
[ecg], and mean change in hourly hr from baseline,
measured using 24-hour ambulatory ecg). potassium
and glucose concentrations were also determined at
screening and during the treatment period after the
first dose at week 0, and at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12.
samples were obtained prior to dosing and 2 and
6 hours after study drug administration.
statistical methods

the study was designed to detect a 10% difference
in trough fev 1 (the primary end point) between each

263

clinical therapeutics

active-treatment group and placebo with 85% power.
due to multiple treatment comparisons, 0t levels for
the primary efficacy analysis of the primary end point
were derived using bonferroni's adjustment to control
the overall type i error at 5%. no adjustments were
made for secondary comparisons.
all efficacy analyses were performed on the intentto-treat (itf) population, according to the treatment
assigned. the itf population included all patients
randomized to double-blind treatment and took at
least i dose of double-blind study medication. all significance testing was 2-tailed and conducted at a significance level of 0.05, unless otherwise noted.
interaction terms were tested at the 10% level. all
pairwise comparisons between treatment groups were
performed using least squares means from the repeatedmeasures linear model.
the analysis of the primary efficacy end point used
sas proc mixed (sas institute inc., cary, north
carolina) with restricted maximum likelihood estimation to fit a repeated-measures linear model with
fixed effects for treatment, time (weeks 0, 6, and 12),
treatment-by-time interaction, and site type, with baseline fev 1 as a covariate, and treatment-by-baseline
fev1 interaction.2°,21 analysis of the %a fev1 auc0_12h
was performed similarly to the primary efficacy end
point, with visit predose fev 1 as the covariate.
descriptive statistics were calculated by treatment
group for baseline variables and each efficacy end
point. where appropriate, 95% cis for differences in
treatment group means or proportions were calculated post hoc. if the 95% ci for the treatment difference
excluded zero, this was considered statistically significant at the 5% level in testing hypotheses of no treatment difference versus treatment difference. for differences in proportions, the normal approximation
was used.
the median time to response was estimated using
the kaplan-meier product-limit method using linear
interpolation; 95% cis were estimated. 22 patients with
no response within 12 hours after first study drug administration were censored at the time of their 12-hour
assessment. for this end point, spirometry measurements collected after rescue/supplemental medication
use were excluded. nonresponders with missing or excluded data prior to 12 hours were censored at the
time of their last valid fev 1 measurement.
a data safety monitoring board (dsmb) periodically reviewed ae and other safety data for the trial.
264

the dsmb did not review any efficacy data, and no
statistical testing or formal stopping rules were used.
the dsmb did not recommend modification or early
discontinuation of the trial.
results
of 917 patients enrolled, 724 were randomized and
717 received study medication (58% were men; mean
age, 62.9 years; mean baseline fev1, 1.2 l [41% predicted]; itt, 141  xxxd216xxx  15 i~g bid, 143  xxxd216xxx  25 i~g bid, 146  xxxd216xxx  50 i~g qd,
144 salmeterol, and 143 placebo). overall, 82% of
patients completed the study. the most common reason for discontinuation was an ae ( xxxd216xxx  15 i~g
bid, 5.7%;  xxxd216xxx  25 i~g bid, 11.9%;  xxxd216xxx  50 i~g qd, 6.2%; salmeterol, 9.0%; placebo,
9.8%) (figure 1). copd aes were the most frequently reported ae leading to discontinuation (4.2%,
0.7%, 2.8%, 1.4%, and 2.8% in the respective
groups).
the groups were well balanced for age, sex, race,
and baseline disease (table i). patients had moderate
or more severe copd as determined by the global
initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease
(gold) criteria.4

spirometry
significantly greater improvement in morning
trough fev 1 was observed over the 12-week doubleblind period for all 3 doses of  xxxd216xxx  (%a from
baseline: 15 i~g bid, +16.9%; 25 i~g bid, +18.9%;
and 50 i~g qd, +14.9%) and for salmeterol (+17.4%)
relative to placebo (+6.0%) (all, p < 0.001). improvements in bronchodilation were evident over the
24-hour dosing interval and at trough after the first
dose (at week 0) and after 12 weeks of study drug
administration (all, p < 0.003) (table ii and figure 2).
there was some reduction in the degree of improvement in trough fev 1 in all groups between weeks 0
and 6, but little additional decline occurred between
weeks 6 and 12. nonetheless, statistically significant
improvement relative to placebo was observed
throughout the 12 weeks of treatment (table ii).
significant improvements in fev 1 auc0_12h were
observed at all time points for the  xxxd216xxx 
groups (all, p < 0.002) in comparison with placebo
(table ii). greater improvement in fev 1 auc0_12 h
was also observed for the  xxxd216xxx  groups compared with salmeterol over the 12-week double-blind

group (range for  xxxd216xxx  doses, 77%-88%;
placebo, 48%). fewer responders (58%) were observed in the salmeterol group, a proportion that did
not differ significantly from placebo (table hi). the
overall treatment differences in time to response were
statistically significant (overall, p < 0.001), with a median time to response that was shorter in the  xxxd216xxx  groups in comparison with the salmeterol and
placebo groups after the first dose and after 12 weeks
of study drug administration (table hi).
patient-reported outcomes
at week 12, improvements in dyspnea, as reflected
by mean tdi focal scores, were observed with all
doses of  xxxd216xxx , but not in the salmeterol or placebo groups (range for  xxxd216xxx  doses, 2.0-2.2 u;
salmeterol, 1.4 u; placebo, 1.1 u) (figure 3). the mean
(95% ci) differences between mean tdi focal score
increases in each  xxxd216xxx  group and placebo
were statistically significant: 0.97 u (0.25-1.69) in
the  xxxd216xxx  15-1~g bid group, 1.08 u (0.3-1.86)
in the 25-1~g bid group, and 1.04 u (0.32-1.77) in the
50-1~g qd group. the difference between salmeterol
and placebo (0.36 u) was not statistically significant
(95% ci, -0.40 to 1.12). improvement in the tdi
focal score of _>1 u, a metric reported to be clinically
important, 23 was observed at week 12 in 57% to 62%
of  xxxd216xxx -treated patients compared with 50%
of salmeterol-treated patients and 37% of patients in
the placebo group.
improvements in mean sgrq total scores at week 6
ranged from -2.6 to -3.6 u in the  xxxd216xxx  groups
and were -4.4 u in the salmeterol group and -1.2 u
in the placebo group. the mean differences versus
placebo (95% cis) were -1.62 u (-3.85 to 0.61) in
the  xxxd216xxx  15-1~g bid group, -2.44 u (-4.62 to
-0.26) in the  xxxd216xxx  25-1~g bid group, -1.41 u
(-3.64 to 0.83) in the  xxxd216xxx  50-1~g qd group,
and -3.18 (-5.44 t o - 0 . 9 2 ) in the salmeterol group.
the greatest improvements were observed in the
symptom domain for all active treatments (range,
-4.1 to -8.3 u); in the placebo group, this value was
-1.1 u (figure 4).
patients in the active-treatment groups had similar
mean decreases in the use of supplemental ipratropium
(a, -1.1 to -1.2 d/wk and -0.8 to -0.9 actuations/d)
and rescue albuterol (a, -0.8 to -1.2 d/wk and -0.6 to
-0.9 actuations/d) that were stable over 12 weeks of daily
dosing (table w). these decreases in supplemental/
february 2007

rescue medications were significantly greater in the
active-treatment groups versus the placebo group
(table w).
after 12 weeks, between 72.2% and 75.6% of patients in the active-treatment groups reported feeling
"better" on the subject global evaluation compared
with 55.2% of patients in the placebo group. the proportions of patients who reported worsening symptoms were 4.6% to 6.7% in the  xxxd216xxx  groups,
10.6% in the salmeterol group, and 15.2% in the
placebo group.
there were no statistically significant differences
(95% cis included zero; data not shown) between
treatment groups with respect to mean improvements
from baseline in the 6-minute walk test at week 9.
these improvements ranged from 35.0 to 88.0 feet
(10.7-26.8 m) in the  xxxd216xxx  groups, 104.0 feet
(31.7 m) in the salmeterol group, and 92.5 feet (28.2 m)
in the placebo group.

tolerability
the ae profiles of the 3 doses of  xxxd216xxx 
were similar to those of the active-control salmeterol
and placebo, including serious aes and copd aes
(table v). overall, most serious aes were respiratory
or cardiovascular in nature. dose-related increases in
tremor and nervousness were observed in the  xxxd216xxx  groups. the overall frequency of copd exacerbations was similar between the active-treatment
and placebo groups (11.6%-13.9% vs 16.9%) and
was stable over the course of the trial: the frequencies
of exacerbations during the first 3 weeks were 6.4%
in the  xxxd216xxx  15-1~g bid group, 6.3% in the  xxxd216xxx  25-1~g bid group, 2.1% in the  xxxd216xxx  50-1~g qd group, 5.6% in the salmeterol
group, and 4.9% in the placebo group. during the last
3 weeks, the rates were 4.0%, 5.2%, 3.2%, 3.3%,
and 6.1%, respectively.
there were dose-related changes in serum potassium and glucose concentrations with increasing doses
of  xxxd216xxx . the mean decreases in potassium
concentrations at week 12 ranged from -0.05 to
-0.19 meq/l a t 2 hours and -0.12 to -0.18 meq/l at
6 hours after study drug administration (salmeterol,
-0.02 and -0.14 meq/l, respectively; placebo, 0.00
and -0.10 meq/l, respectively). the mean increases
in glucose concentrations in the  xxxd216xxx  groups
at week 12 ranged from 6.2 to 26.0 mg/dl at 2 hours
and 9.1 to 18.8 mg/dl at 6 hours after study drug ad269

discussion

the results of this clinical trial in patients with copd
suggest that daily treatment with each of 3 different
doses of nebulized  xxxd216xxx  was effective in improving bronchodilation over 12 weeks.  xxxd216xxx 
administration was associated with clinically and statistically significant improvements in mean %a fev 1
to the end of the dosing interval (morning trough
fev 1) in comparison with placebo. in general,  xxxd216xxx  doses >15 pg bid were associated with only
small, incremental improvements in bronchodilator
efficacy. substantial improvements from predose or
trough levels in bronchodilation were also observed in
fev 1 measured over the dosing interval (fev 1
auc0--12 h) and in peak improvements in fev 1 (peak
%a fev1). substantial improvements in airway function and patient-reported symptom improvement
scale scores were observed when compared with those
in the placebo group. changes in these and other out271

comes in the active treatments versus placebo groups
were evident even though patients in all groups could
use 2 bronchodilators with different mechanisms of
action (ipratropium and albuterol) as needed for symptom relief.
the extent and time course of fev 1 improvement
differed in  xxxd216xxx - versus salmeterol-treated patients. bronchodilation was rapid in the  xxxd216xxx 
groups, as measured by the median time required for
patients to achieve a 10% increase in fev 1 from predose levels (<3 minutes at week 0 and <15 minutes
at week 12). the median time to response was longer
in the salmeterol group (15 minutes at week 0 and
132 minutes at week 12). improvements in fev 1 from
visit predose values (fev 1 auc0_12 h and peak %a
fev1) also were greater with  xxxd216xxx  treatment
compared with salmeterol.
tolerance, defined as a diminution in the extent of
bronchodilator response over time, was evident in all
active-treatment groups. the extent of improvement
in trough fev 1 at week 6 declined from week 0 by
26% to 33% in the  xxxd216xxx  groups, and by 25%
in the salmeterol group. despite declines in the first
6 weeks, clinically meaningful and statistically signifi272

cant bronchodilation continued to be observed in the
 xxxd216xxx  and salmeterol groups in comparison
with placebo for all lung function outcome variables,
including peak percent predicted fev1, throughout
the 12 weeks of treatment. importantly, no increases
in the frequency of copd exacerbations over time
were observed among patients receiving the active
treatments.
fev 1 is an important indicator of copd severity.2s
however, fev 1 is imperfectly associated with other clinical signs and symptoms indicative of copd severity
and patients' response to treatment. in 1 study, dyspnea and health status were more predictive of risk for
death than was fevi.2~
dyspnea is an important symptom in copd that is
associated with morbidity and risk for death in these
patients. therefore, effective treatments target improvement in dyspnea.27 in this trial, clinically meaningful
improvement23 in td117 was observed in 57% to 62%
of patients receiving  xxxd216xxx , compared with
51% and 37% of patients receiving salmeterol and

treatment groups. as a further reflection of improved

in the use of supplemental ipratropium and rescue albuterol throughout the 12-week treatment period. of
patients treated with  xxxd216xxx , 72% to 76% reported overall improvement over the course of the
trial, compared with 73% with salmeterol and 55%
with placebo. only marginal improvement was observed in the 6-minute walk distances in the activetreatment groups; this value did not differ from that
with placebo. in other clinical trials in copd, treatmentfebruary 2007

the ae profiles of the 3 doses of  xxxd216xxx  were
similar to those of salmeterol and placebo. the frequency of copd exacerbations was marginally lower

placebo group and did not increase over 12 weeks of
treatment. there were no differences in the rates of

were expected dose-related changes in serum potassium and glucose concentrations, as well as certain
i]-mediated aes (tremor and nervousness) with increasing doses of  xxxd216xxx .
 xxxd216xxx  is unique in 2 ways: (1) it is the single (r,r) isomer of  xxxd2155xxx  that has been demonstrated both in vitro 1°,12,13 and in vivo31 to provide
the i]-agonist activity of the racemate, and (2) it has
been formulated as an inhalation solution. at present,
 xxxd216xxx  is the only nebulized long-acting bronchodilator approved for the treatment of copd in the
united states. a nebulized delivery system may be a
more beneficial route of administration in some patients with copd, especially those who have difficulty performing the coordinated deep inhalation required for effective use of single-breath inhalers, those
without the dexterity required to manipulate a handheld device, and those with severe airway function impairment who cannot achieve a minimum inspiratory
velocity and/or time for adequate drug delivery by dry
powder inhalers.32
potential limitations of this study related to its relatively short treatment duration (12 weeks) and entry
criteria that limited the participation of patients with
mild disease.
conclusions

in this large, multicenter trial,  xxxd216xxx  inhalation
solution was observed to provide statistically significant and clinically meaningful long-term improvement
in lung function over 12 weeks relative to placebo, and
was well tolerated. in this study, the lowest dose of
 xxxd216xxx  tested (15 lag bid) was effective, and higher doses conferred only small, incremental improvements. consensus guidelines support the use of longacting bronchodilators in the treatment of copd patients
with moderate or severe degrees of airway function impairment. these results suggest that  xxxd216xxx  is an
effective option for patients with copd who could
benefit from sustained bronchodilation therapy delivered through nebulization.
