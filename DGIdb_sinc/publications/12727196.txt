properties of purified recombinant human polyamine oxidase,  xxxg2178xxx /smo.  the discovery of an inducible oxidase whose apparent substrate preference is  xxxd3234xxx  indicates that polyamine catabolism is more complex than that originally proposed. to facilitate the study of this enzyme, the purification and characterization of the recombinant human  xxxg2178xxx /smo polyamine oxidase are reported. purified  xxxg2178xxx /smo oxidizes both  xxxd3234xxx  (k(m)=1.6 microm) and n(1)-acetylspermine (k(m)=51 microm), but does not oxidize spermidine. the purified human enzyme also does not oxidize eight representative antitumor polyamine analogues; however, specific oligamine analogues were found to be potent inhibitors of the oxidation of  xxxd3234xxx  by  xxxg2178xxx /smo. the results of these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that  xxxg2178xxx /smo represents a new addition to the polyamine metabolic pathway that may represent a new target for antineoplastic drug development.
