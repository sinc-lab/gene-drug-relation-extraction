the anticholinesterase effects of bis(7)-tacrine were
compared with tacrine in vitro and in vivo. based on
ic50 ratios, the dimeric analog bis(7)-tacrine was, in a
reversible manner, up to 150-fold more potent and 250fold more selective than tacrine for acetylcholinesterase
(ache) over  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ). following a
single oral administration, both bis(7)-tacrine and tacrine produced dose-dependent inhibitions of ache in
rat brain, but bis(7)-tacrine exhibited higher ef®cacy
and ache/ xxxg248xxx  sclectivity than tacrine. the antiache ef®cacy of bis(7)-tacrine was quite similar following an oral or i.p. administration, but tacrine showed
much lower ef®cacy when administered orally than
when given i.p. these ®ndings suggest bis(7)-tacrine, a
highly potent and selective inhibitor of ache, can
probably be used as an improved drug in the palliative
treatment of ad. neuroreport 10:789±793 # 1999

introduction
in senile dementia of the alzheimer's type (sdat),
one treatment strategy that has attracted attention is
the use of cholinesterase inhibitors (cheis) to increase synaptic concentrations of acetylcholine
(ach) in brain, thereby increasing excitatory cholinergic tone [1±3]. agents such as physostigmine and
tacrine
(9-amino- xxxd3270xxx )
have been used for palliative treatment of mild and
moderate alzheimer's disease (ad) [4,5]. although
improvements in memory and global function in
patients with ad have been reported using tacrine,
a number of other studies have demonstrated
tacrine-induced peripheral side-effects and hepatotoxicity [6,7]. since tacrine has many actions in the
central nervous system and poor selectivity for
inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (ache), it would be
desirable from the side-effect standpoint to design
more potent and selective inhibitors. pang and his
co-workers devised an automated computer docking
program to study structural modi®cations of tacrine,
and found that dimeric tacrine analogs linked via an
alkylene chain might well achieve this aim [8,9]. the
best length determined by experiments was reached
in the compound named heptylene-linked bistacrine (bis(7)-tacrine). on the basis of inhibitory
potency to ache, this compound is superior to all
other cheis currently being used for management
of ad [10]. furthermore, it is easily synthesized

and is more hydrophobic than tacrine. the purpose
of this study was to provide additional comparative
data on bis(7)-tacrine and tacrine by examining their
anticholinesterase activities in vitro and in vivo.

materials and methods
animals: sprague±dawley rats (220±280 g) of
either sex were supplied by the animal care facility
in the hong kong university of science and technology.
administration of drugs: bis(7)-tacrine.2hcl was
prepared according to the literature [11] and recrystallized from 10% methanol±water. elemental
analysis matched the dihydrate and hplc analysis
indicated . 99.5% purity. tacrine was purchased
from sigma. these compounds were all dissolved in
saline and administered in a volume of 10 ml/kg b.w.
the rats were decapitated 30 min after intragastric
(i.g.) or i.p. administration of chei. for assay of the
duration of action, the rats were killed at various
times following oral administration. control rats
were given saline.
preparation of samples: for the analysis of the
enzyme activities, rats were killed by decapitation,
the blood was collected and the brains were dissected on ice into the frontal cortex, hippocampus,
striatum and one hemisphere. for the time-course

study of  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ) activity after
i.g. chei, the blood was taken from the orbital
venous plexus. the serum was obtained after centrifugation (3500 3 g, for 10 min).
inhibitory effects on cholinesterase and inhibition
mechanism: the cholinesterase (che) assay was
performed using a colorimetric method reported by
ellman et al. [12], with minor modi®cations. for
assay of ache or  xxxg248xxx  activity in vitro, rat cortex
was homogenized in 39 vol 75 mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4. the homogenate was preincubated for 5 min with  xxxd2055xxx  (0.1 mm), a
selective inhibitor of  xxxg248xxx , and serum was preincubated with bw284c51 (0.01 mm) which inhibited
ache. a mixture of 4 ml containing acetylthiocholine iodide (0.3 mm) or butyrylthiocholine iodide
(0.4 mm), 1 ml sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 mm,
ph 7.4), the compound under test (0.1 ml) and
homogenate or serum (0.1 ml) was incubated at 378c
for 8 min. the reaction was then terminated by
adding 1 ml 3% (w/v)  xxxd3215xxx 
followed by 1 ml 0.2% (w/v) 5,59-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid to produce the yellow anion of 5-thio2-nitro- xxxd306xxx . the extent of color production
was measured spectrophometrically at 420 nm. the
enzyme activity was expressed as a percentage of the
activity observed in the absence of inhibitor. the
ic50 was de®ned as the concentration of inhibitor
necessary to yield 50% inhibition of enzyme activity. the ki values for the two agents were determined using a lineweaver±burke plot [13] in cortex
of rat brain. a plot of 1/od vs the inverse of
substrate concentration was also made to distinguish
modes of inhibition of ache. for determination of
ache activity ex vivo, frontal cortex, hippocampus,
striatum and whole brain were homogenized in 49,
49, 249 and 39 vol ice cold sodium phosphate buffer
(75 mm, ph 7.0), respectively. all samples were
assayed in duplicate. che activity was expressed as
nmol ach hydrolyzed/mg protein/min.  xxxg248xxx  activity was determined only in male rats.
two criteria were used to examine the reversibility of bis(7)-tacrine and tacrine. one criterion is

time dependence. bis(7)-tacrine (5 nm) or tacrine
(50 nm) were preincubated with brain ache at
378c for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 min, respectively, before
addition of substrate; activity of the inhibitor±
enzyme mixture was then determined as above. diisopropyl¯uorophosphate (dfp, sigma chemical
co.), an irreversible inhibitor, was used as control.
the other criterion is dialysis. a solution of brain
ache preincubated with bis(7)-tacrine (2 nm) or
tacrine (200 nm) at 378c for 3 min was washed using
tris±hcl buffer (0.01 m, ph 7.4) four times. each
time the buffer was removed by centrifugation
(15 000 r.p.m., 10 min). the enzyme activity of the
solution was measured before and after centrifugation. a control solution (no agents) was treated
similarly.
protein assay: protein concentrations were measured with the coomassie blue (bio-rad co.) protein-binding method [14] using bovine serum
albumin as standard.
statistical analysis: values represent mean  s.e.m.
the data were analysed by student's t-test.

results
inhibitory effects on ache and  xxxg248xxx  in vitro: rat
cortex (ache) and rat serum ( xxxg248xxx ) were used as
the enzyme sources to test the inhibitory effects of
tacrine and bis(7)-tacrine in vitro. as shown in
table 1, based on ic50 ratios, the anti-ache
activity of bis(7)-tacrine, compared with tacrine, was
found to be , 150-fold more potent and 250-fold
more selective for ache over  xxxg248xxx . a lineweaver±burke plot for bis(7)-tacrine indicated a pattern
of inhibition of brain ache of the mixed competitive type, as the intersection of the lines occurred in
the second quadrant. tacrine showed a very similar
pattern of mixed type inhibition (fig. 1). the
apparent ache inhibition constant (ki value) for
bis(7)-tacrine was 37 times more potent than that of
tacrine (2.8 nm and 104 nm, respectively).
the reversibility of bis(7)-tacrine and tacrine was

also examined with two criteria involving time
dependence and dialysis. as shown in fig. 2, dfp,
an irreversible ache inhibitor, produced a steady
decrease in ache activity in a time-dependent
fashion. however, under the same conditions, both
bis(7)-tacrine (5 nm) and tacrine (50 nm) exhibited a
nearly constant level of ache activity after the
initial decrease, consistent with reversible inhibition.
in addition, dialysis completely restored enzyme
activity (93.8% and 98.8% of control) that had been
inhibited by bis(7)-tacrine (2 nm, 42.6% of control)
and tacrine (200 nm, 23.8% of control), but dfp
maintained 88.7% inhibition (i.e. 12.3% of control
activity) even after dialysis. these results demonstrated that bis(7)-tacrine, like tacrine, inhibited
ache in a reversible manner.
inhibitory effects on ache and  xxxg248xxx  after acute
medication: changes in che activity in the three
brain regions and serum were tested 30 min after i.g.
administration of bis(7)-tacrine and tacrine at several

dose-dependent inhibition of che activity. signi®cant ache inhibition ( p , 0.05, p , 0.01 vs control) in cortex, hippocampus and striatum was seen
with 9.5±38 ìmol/kg bis(7)-tacrine and 90±

that bis(7)-tacrine exhibited higher ef®cacy for
ache inhibition and lower ef®cacy for  xxxg248xxx 
inhibition, compared with tacrine (fig. 3).
compared with the results involving i.p. administration, bis(7)-tacrine (19 ìmol/kg) given orally exerted quite similar anti-cholinesterase effects in rats

s.e.m. (n  4±6).  p , 0.05,  p , 0.01 vs saline control. basal saline

2.8, 87.9  7.3, 516.6  43.1 and 1.18  0.19 nmol/mg protein/min, respectively.

i.p. administration, not only on ache in three brain
regions ( p , 0.05, p , 0.01 vs i.g. route), but also on
 xxxg248xxx  in serum ( p , 0.05 vs i.g. route). these data
suggest that the i.g. and i.p. ef®cacies of bis(7)tacrine are almost identical whereas tacrine was less
effective when given orally than when administered
i.p. for achieving comparable ache inhibition.
time course of che activity after i.g. administration: the time course of che activity in rats was
determined from 15 min to 360 min after a single i.g.
administration. as can be seen in fig. 5, both bis(7)tacrine (19 ìmol/kg) and tacrine (120 ìmol/kg) exhibited nearly equivalent peak inhibition and inhibition duration in cortex or whole brain. for instance,
inhibition of ache activity in whole brain exceeding 10% persisted between 15 and 180 min for
bis(7)-tacrine, but lasted a shorter time for tacrine.
however, continued severe peripheral cholinergic
side effects such as fasciculations, salivation and
sedation were observed 5±10 min following medication of tacrine; with bis(7)-tacrine, only minor
cholinergic signs were detected. at these dosages the
effects of the two drugs on  xxxg248xxx  inhibition vary
considerably. peak inhibition for bis(7)-tacrine was
only 41%, compared with 65% for tacrine. the
duration of inhibition for bis(7)-tacrine was also
signi®cantly shorter than tacrine: at 360 min, only
11%  xxxg248xxx  inhibition remained for bis(7)-tacrine,
compared with 51% for tacrine.

discussion
tacrine is approved in the usa for palliative treatment of ad, despite evidence of signi®cant
dose-dependent hepatotoxicity. in 1996 pang and
co-workers demonstrated that bis(7)-tacrine offered
signi®cantly increased potency and selectivity as an
ache inhibitor [9]. the present study offers

anticholinesterase effects of bis(7)-tacrine
additional evidence for the superiority of bis(7)tacrine as a palliative ad drug. in vitro rat cortex
ache ki determinations revealed that bis(7)-tacrine
was 37 times more potent than tacrine; this matches
well the previously determined ki ratio of 57 in
human brain cerebellum described by pang et al.
[9].
in the interest of evaluating the comparative in
vivo effectiveness of bis(7)-tacrine and tacrine, these
drugs were administered in rats i.p. and i.g. following a single oral administration, both drugs produced a dose-dependent inhibition of ache activity
in three different brain regions. bis(7)-tacrine was
thus shown to exhibit a 10-fold increase in inhibition potency relative to tacrine. importantly, bis(7)tacrine gave nearly equivalent anti-ache ef®cacy
when administered i.g. and i.p. in contrast, tacrine
given orally was much less effective than given i.p.
these results suggest the greater oral bioavailability
of bis(7)-tacrine. it is important to note that the
lower therapeutic doses of bis(7)-tacrine relative to
tacrine suggested by this study could translate to
signi®cantly reduced toxicity.
furthermore, at dosages which give equivalent in
vivo ache inhibition, bis(7)-tacrine exhibits signi®cantly lower in vivo rat serum  xxxg248xxx  inhibition than
tacrine. this result is signi®cant in view of current
theories of anti- xxxg248xxx  based toxicity. alder et al.
[15] have demonstrated that selective inhibition of
up to 90% of either ache or  xxxg248xxx  in tracheal
smooth muscle was tolerated with no effect on
baseline tension. however, concurrent inhibition of
both enzymes produced marked contractions. it
seems likely that inhibition of  xxxg248xxx  in peripheral
tissues may contribute to toxic side-effects, hereby
limiting the clinically tolerable dose of chei [16,17].
the greater potency of tacrine as a serum  xxxg248xxx 
inhibitor than as a cortex ache inhibitor is well
known. in the current study, the high dose of
tacrine required caused severe peripheral cholinergic
side effects, including fasciculations, tremors and
excessive salivation. in contrast, at the 10-fold lower

neuroreport
dose of bis(7)-tacrine required to achieve equivalent
in vivo ache inhibition, these side effects were
much less frequent and less severe. these results
again suggest good clinical tolerability and reduced
toxicity for bis(7)-tacrine relative to tacrine.

conclusion
the present study ®rst revealed that bis(7)-tacrine
has nearly equivalent anticholinesterase ef®cacy
when administered i.g. or i.p. furthermore, relative
to tacrine, bis(7)-tacrine signi®cantly improved in
vivo brain ache inhibition, reduced in vivo serum
 xxxg248xxx  inhibition, and fewer peripheral cholinergic
side effects. in total these results suggest that bis(7)tacrine can probably be used as an improved drug in
the palliative treatment of ad.
