the birth incidence of neural tube defects (ntds) in south africa is threefold to sixfold higher in rural compared with urban
blacks. we investigated whether folate deficiency and aberrant homocysteine metabolism could explain the high ntd
incidence in rural black populations. plasma folate and total homocyst(e)ine (thcy) concentrations were determined in
apparently healthy rural black women (n = 107), rural black women with a history of pregnancy complicated by ntds (n = 54),
and urban blacks (n = 101). methionine load tests were performed on the 54 women with a history of ntd-affected pregnancy
and 54 controls matched for age and body mass. the presence of the 677c ~ t mutation in the methylene  xxxd3334xxx 
reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ) gene was investigated in both groups by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of genomic dna and hinfl
digestion of the pcr product. apparently healthy urban black women (n = 101) had a lower (p < .001) plasma folate
concentration compared with rural black women (n = 107). women with a history of ntd-affected pregnancy did not differ
significantly from controls with respect to plasma folate, fasting homocyst(e)ine, methionine, and the post-methionine load
increase in plasma homocyst(e)ine. more than 50% of both of the latter groups had a post-methionine load increase in plasma
thcy less than the fifth percentile as observed in a healthy white control group. no homozygotes for the 677c ~ t mutation in
the  xxxg1475xxx  gene were found in black mothers with ntd-affected offspring or controls. it is concluded that black urbanization is
characterized by a diminished folate status that is paradoxically associated with a lower ntd birth incidence. homozygosity
for the 677c ~ t mutation in the gene coding for  xxxg1475xxx  does not constitute a genetic risk factor for ntds in blacks. no
aberrant homocysteine metabolism could be demonstrated in black w o m e n with ntd-affected pregnancies.

n south africa, the prevalence of neural tube defects
(ntds) in the black population varies according to geographical location. ncayiyana reported that the birth incidence
of ntds in blacks from the rural transkei was 6.13 per 1,000
live births, 1 while a recent study undertaken on blacks in the
rural northern province reported a ntd incidence of 3.55 per
1,000 live births. 2 in contrast, the documented birth incidence of
ntds is considerably lower in the black urban populations of
south africa? ,4 based on a 20-year observation period, buccimazza et ap reported a ntd incidence of only 0.95 per 1,000
live births in the black population of cape town. delport et al 4
performed a prospective hospital-based study on live-born
infants over a 3-year period at kalafong academic hospital,
pretoria, and found a ntd incidence of 0.99 per 1,000 live
births in the urban black population group. it remains unexplained as to why urbanization is associated with such a
dramatic decline in the ntd incidence.
maternal folate supplementation in the periconceptional
period reduces the frequency of ntd-affected births. 56 although the data are not entirely consistent, there is evidence that
maternal folate deficiency in the periconceptional period increases the risk for a ntd-affected pregnancy. kirke et al7
demonstrated that early pregnancy serum and red blood cell
folate concentrations were significantly lower in 81 women
with pregnancies subsequently affected by ntds compared
with a systematic sample of 247 control pregnancies. further
analysis of the data reported by kirke et al showed a continuous
dose-response relation between a woman's risk of having a
child with a ntd and red blood cell folate levels. 8 wald et al 9
reviewed studies published up to 1996 and concluded that
maternal folate levels were significantly lower in ntd cases
compared with controls during the first trimester of pregnancy.
the mechanism by which reduced folate status may cause a
ntd has been suggested to involve impaired homocysteine

metabolism. elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine* concentrations
have been observed in mothers who previously gave birth to
children with ntds 1°-12 and in the amniotic fluid of mothers
pregnant with a ntd fetus. 13 furthermore, post-methionine
load hyperhomocyst(e)inemia was reported in nine of 41
women with a history of a ntd child. 1° aberrant homocysteine
metabolism in parents with ntd-affected offspring may be at
least partially explained by a twofold to threefold increase in the
prevalence of homozygosity for the 677c - ~ t mutation in the
gene coding for the enzyme methylene  xxxd3334xxx  reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ). 14 a study on fibroblast cultures from ntdaffected fetuses showed that homozygosity for the 677c ~ t
mutation was associated with a 7.2-fold increased risk for
ntds. i5 the 677c - ~ t mutation results in an alanine to valine
substitution in  xxxg1475xxx , 16 renders the enzyme thermolabile, 16

considering the etiological role o f folate and/or vitamin  xxxd2237xxx

differences in the folate/ xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  nutritional status could
explain the differences in n t d incidence in rural and urban
black populations. it has been reported previously that folate
deficiencies are c o m m o n in rural pregnant black w o m e n 24 and

two tubes of blood with edta as the anticoagulant were obtained
from an apparently healthy group of noupregnant rural black women
(age, 31.3 ± 7.5 years [mean ± sd]; n = 107). the women lived from
subsistence farming and attended family planning or immunization
clinics at various rural hospitals in the northern province, south africa
(fig 2). blood samples were immediately chilled on ice and centrifuged
on site. plasma samples were frozen in dry ice and sent to the laboratory
in pretoria. an urban sample of women were obtained from black
women (age, 25.4 ± 3.9 years; n = 101) of the pretoria area who
visited a family planning or immunization clinic; blood samples were
obtained from four clinics to reflect the socioeconomic composition of
the local urban black population. seventeen women were recruited from
an inner-city clinic, 23 came from two clinics in middle-class suburbs,
and 61 came from a clinic serving a low socioeconomic suburb and
adjacent informal settlements. blood samples were obtained and
handled as already described. all blood samples were collected between
october 1995 and march 1996.

follow-up study of women with a history of a ntd birth
since 1990, a clinical genetic outreach program to seven rural
hospitals in the northern province has been conducted by the department of human genetics, university of pretoria. nursing staff in these
rural hospitals were trained in the diagnosis and documentation of
congenital anomalies including ntds. this documentation, which
included a clinical description and pregnancy and family history, as well
as photographs, was then available for review by the visiting clinical
geneticists for geneuc counseling. with the help of the genetics-u'ained
nursing staff of five of these rural hospitals, 54 black women who gave
birth to a ntd-affected child between 1990 and 1995 were invited to
participate in the study. of 54 participants, 30 had a child with
documented spina bifida, 10 with anencephaly, and seven with craniorachischisis, while seven had offspring with an encephalocele. for each
woman with a ntd birth history, an age- and body mass-paired control
was selected from the rural population sample already described.

laboratory analyses
a

°

plasma concentrations of vitamin ba2 and folate, as well as red blood
cell folate concentrations, were determined by a commercially available
radioassay kit (becton dickinson, orangeburg, ny). plasma pyridoxal
5'-phosphate (plp) concentrations were measured by high-performance liqutd chromatography (hplc) as described previously.26
plasma homocyst(e)ine was derivatized with ammonium 7-ftuorobenzo-2 exa 1, 3  xxxd3045xxx -4-sulfonate ([sbd-f] wako, neuss, germany)
according to the method of araki and sako. 27 the method entails
complete reduction of homocystme, the mixed drsulfide (cystemehomocysteine), and release of protein-bound bomocysteine. this method
therefore measures total (free + protein-bound) plasma homocyst(e)ine
concentranons. the sbd-denvative of homocysteine was detertmned
by hplc. 28 plasma methionine concentrations were measured according to the hplc method of potgieter et al. 29 this method quantifies
methtonine and  xxxd2596xxx  (an oxidation product of methionine formed during sample processing) and produces a reliable estimate
of an indivtdual's methionine status.
dna was extracted from lymphocytes as described previously9 the
presence of the 677c ~ t mutation in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene was

statistics
student's t test was used for all between-group comparisons except
plasma thcy determinations, for which the mann-whimey u test was
used to accommodate the observed nongaussian data distribution.

ethics
the study was approved by the university human ethics corntmttee
and performed according to the guidelines of the declaration of
helslnld. subjects for methionine load tests provided informed consent
before participation in the study. when appropnate, the informedconsent form was translated into the native language of the participants
by a community sister fluent in that language.
fig 2. map showing the (a) area (northern province) and (b) rural
villages where the study was performed. the population sample
consisted of 53, 31, 2, 18, and 3 women from nkhensani, groothoek,
siloam, elim, and mankweng, respectively, and the number of ntd
cases from these centers was 25, 8, 2, 12, and 7, respectively.

of women with a history of a ntd birth was 26.5 +- 9.8 years, which
was not significantly different from the mean age of 28.3 _+ 9 8 years for
the controls. none of the cases or controls were on vitarmn supplementation. fasting blood samples wtth edta anticoagulant were obtained
from each woman; the samples were centrifuged on site, and the plasma
was frozen in dry ice. the buffy coat and red blood cells were separated
and stored frozen. subsequently.  xxxd2595xxx  (100 mg/kg body
weight, dissolved m imitation orange drink) was administered orally.
after 2 hours, a light methionine-poor lunch was served: the participants were not allowed to eat until the first 2 hours elapsed, but were
allowed to drink water at will. the second blood sample was obtained 6
hours after admimstration of the methionine load and was processed as
already described.

methionine load tests on apparently healthy white women
oral methionine load tests were also admimstered to 64 apparently
healthy white women (mean age, 35 9 -+ 8.1 years) recruited from the
major employers in pretorta. women who parttclpated were mothers of
healthy normal children, and women who reported a previous miscarriage were excluded.

discussion
a previous study by baynes et al24 at an antenatal clinic in the
northern province found that folate deficiency was common
among black women in the second or third trimester of
pregnancy: 48% had plasma folate concentrations less than 3.0
ng/ml (<6.75 nmol/l), and a mean corpuscular volume greater
than 100 fl was present in 35% of the study population. our
results suggest that the prevalence of folate deficiency is also
high in rural nonpregnant black women. twenty-one percent of
the rural population sample had plasma folate levels less than
6.75 nmol/l. nevertheless, the rural population sample had a
significantly better folate status (as assessed by the plasma
folate concentration) than the urban population group (table 1),
in which the prevalence of a low folate status (<6.75 nmol/l)
was 46%. this is presumably explained by the fact that the rural
population, which lives mainly from subsistence farming, has
more ready access to leafy vegetables (a rich dietary source of
folate) than re'ban dwellers. the  xxxd3049xxx  status of rural
women was also significantly better compared with urban
dwellers, which supports the suggestion that rural women
consume a diet containing relatively more vitamins. the fasting
plasma thcy concentration, a sensitive metabolic indicator of
folate and  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  nutritional status, tended to be lower in
rural women, again indicating a relatively better vitamin
nutritional status. our results support the observations from a
dietary study on urban blacks in cape town, which indicated a
significant trend for lower folate consumption with urbanization. 32

note. results are the mean ± sd. plasma methionine is the total
methionine concentration, ie, including oxidized methionine, postmethionine load plasma methionine and homocyst(e)ine concentrations were corrected for the respective fasting concentrations. differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant.

(table 2). there were no significant differences in fasting
plasma thcy and methionine, as well as the increase in
post-methionine load thcy and methionine. both the black
control and ntd groups had considerably lower postmethionine load thcy concentrations compared with apparently
healthy white women (fig 3): 51% of black controls and 52% of
black ntd cases had post-methionine load plasma thcy
concentrations less than the fifth percentile as observed in
whites.
the prevalence of the homozygous 677c ~ t mutation in
the  xxxg1475xxx  gene was examined in women with a history of a
ntd birth and in controls. no homozygotes were found in
either group (table 3). however, nine of 54 (16.6%) controls
and 12 of 58 (20.7%) ntd cases were heterozygous for the
mutation. a population genetic test showed that this black
population sample was in hardy-weinberg equilibrium.

folate and neural tube defects in blacks

273

the urban population sample is reasonably representative of
the various socioeconomic classes among the black urban
population and is typical of the population served by the
kalafong academic hospital, pretoria, where a well-documented study reported a ntd incidence of only 0.99 per 1,000
live births. 4 considering that the ntd prevalence in rural areas
is 3.55 to 6.13 per 1,000 live births, m our data suggest that the
substantial decrease in the ntd prevalence with black urbanization cannot be explained by an improved folate or  xxxd2716xxx  12
status. in fact, the significantly lower folate status and a
tendency for a higher thcy concentration in urban blacks
challenges the notion that folate deficiency increases the risk of
a ntd pregnancy in this population group. this possibility has
been further investigated in black women with a history of ntd
births.
the data presented in table 2 indicate that black rural women
with a history of ntd-affected children do not differ significantly from controls with respect to vitamin nutritional status.
this finding supports the general notion that a frank folate
deficiency is not a prerequisite for a ntd. 33 it has been
suggested that supplemental folate relieves a relative metabolic
block 33 that otherwise may have resulted in a failure of the
neural tube to close early m fetal development. evidence from
white populations indicates that this presumed metabolic aberration involves homocysteine metabolism, 1°-13 but our results do
not support a causative role for aberrant homocysteine metabolism in the failure of proper neural tube closure. in contrast to
studies performed in a european population, 10 we found no
difference in post-methionine load thcy concentrations in black
mothers with ntd-affected offspring compared with agematched controls. on the contrary, black women with ntdaffected offspring demonstrated highly effective metabolism of
the methionine load. more than 50% of these women had
post-methionine load plasma thcy concentrations less than the

fifth percentile as observed in healthy whttes with normal
children (fig 3). this supports a previous observation that
blacks metabolize homocysteme more effectively than whites, 34
and indicates that other metabolic and/or genetic factors contribute to the high rate of ntd-affected pregnancy among rural
blacks.
in whites, homozygosity for the 677c ~ t mutatmn in the
 xxxg1475xxx  gene constitutes a genetic risk factor for a ntdaffected pregnancy.14.15 however, we found no homozygotes for
the 677c ~ t mutation in black mothers with ntd-affected
offspring or controls (table 3). based on the frequency of
heterozygotes (20.5% for the whole group, ie, cases and
controls), we expect the frequency for homozygosity in the
black population to be approximately 1%. this corresponds to a
study in african-americans, in which the estimated homozygote frequency is also about 1%. 35 it is clear that the  xxxg1475xxx 
polymorphism does not explain the occurrence of ntds in the
south african black population.
in conclusion, the well-documented and considerable decline
in the prevalence of ntds with black urbanization remains
unexplained. homozygosity for the 677c ---* t mutation in the
gene coding for  xxxg1475xxx  is low in blacks and does not
constitute a genetic risk factor for ntds in this group. our data
question the role of folate deficiency and aberrant homocysteine
metabolism in the etiology of ntds in blacks.
