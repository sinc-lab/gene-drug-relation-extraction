crystallization, x-ray diffraction and oligomeric characterization of  xxxg232xxx  from yersinia pestis, a key polyamine biosynthetic enz...   xxxg232xxx  (adc) is a 70 kda pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (plp) dependent enzyme that controls an alternative step in the biosynthesis of polyamines in some bacteria and plants. crystals of adc were flash-cooled and diffracted to 3.0 a resolution using a synchrotron-radiation source. crystals of adc are monoclinic, with four monomers in the asymmetric unit. light-scattering data reveals that the enzyme forms dimers in solution. the rotation function suggests the presence of two dimers in the asymmetric unit. heavy-atom searches have identified pcmbs as forming a mercury derivative.
