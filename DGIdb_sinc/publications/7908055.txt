binding of typical and atypical antipsychotic agents to 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 and 5-hydroxytryptamine-7 receptors.  the authors examined the affinities of 36 typical and atypical antipsychotic agents for the cloned rat 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 ( xxxg1119xxx ) and rat 5-hydroxytryptamine-7 (5-ht7) receptors in transiently expressed cos-7 cells (5-ht7) or stably transfected hek-293 cells ( xxxg1119xxx  receptors). clozapine and several related atypical antipsychotic agents (rilapine, olanzepine, tiospirone, fluperlapine, clorotepine and zotepine) had high affinities for the newly discovered  xxxg1119xxx  receptor (kis < 20 nm). the 5-ht7 receptor bound clozapine, rilapine, fluperlapine, clorotepine, zotepine and risperidone but not tiospirone and olanzepine, with affinities less than 15 nm. in addition, several typical antipsychotic agents ( xxxd1679xxx , chlorpromazine, clothiapine and fluphenazine) had high affinities for both the  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors.  xxxd2956xxx , a diphenylbutylpiperidine, had the highest affinity of all the typical antipsychotic agents tested for the 5-ht7 receptor (ki = 0.5 nm). three putative atypical antipsychotic agents melperone,  xxxd162xxx  and mdl 100907 did not bind with high affinities to either the  xxxg1119xxx  or 5-ht7 receptors (kis > 50 nm). several dopamine-selective antipsychotic agents (raclopride, rimcazole and penfluridol) had essentially no affinity for either the  xxxg1119xxx  or 5-ht7 receptors (ki values > 5000 nm).(abstract truncated at 250 words).
