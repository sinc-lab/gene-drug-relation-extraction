abstract
sigma-1 receptors are widely expressed in the mammalian brain and
also in organs of the immune, endocrine and reproductive systems. based on behavioral
and pharmacological assessments, sigma-1 receptors are important in memory and cognitive processes, and are thought to be involved in specific psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia, depression, and drug addiction. it is thought that specific neuroactive steroids are endogenous ligands for these sites. in addition, several sigma-1 receptor binding steroids including progesterone, dihydroepiandrosterone (dhea), and
testosterone are being examined clinically for specific therapeutic purposes; however,
their mechanisms of action have not been clearly defined. we previously described the
high affinity sigma-1 receptor selective pet tracer [18f]fps. this study examines the
effect of neuroactive steroids on [18f]fps binding in vitro and in vivo. inhibition constants were determined in vitro for progesterone, testosterone, dhea, estradiol, and estriol binding to the [18f]fps labeled receptor. the affinity order (ki values) for these
steroids ranged from 36 nm for progesterone to >10,000 nm for estrodiol and estriol.
biodistribution studies revealed that i.v. coadministration of progesterone (10 mg/kg),
testosterone (20 mg/kg), or dhea (20 mg/kg) significantly decreased [18f]fps uptake
(%id/g) by up to 50% in nearly all of eight brain regions examined. [18f]fps uptake in
several peripheral organs that express sigma-1 receptors (heart, spleen, muscle, lung)
was also reduced (54–85%). these studies clearly demonstrate that exogenously administered steroids can occupy sigma-1 receptors in vivo, and that [18f]fps may provide an
effective tool for monitoring sigma-1 receptor occupancy of specific therapeutic steroids
during clinical trials. synapse 61:540–546, 2007. v 2007 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction
sigma receptors, initially suggested to be part of the
opiate system, were first described 30 years ago in
reports of the evaluation of phencyclidine derivatives in
the chronic spinal dog model (martin et al., 1976). over
the time, and with the development of more selective
ligands, it was demonstrated that sigma receptors are
not opiate receptors but are in fact quite distinct from
all previously characterized mammalian proteins. it is
currently accepted that two sigma receptor subtypes
exist, and these are termed sigma-1 and sigma-2
(debonnel, 1993; itzhak and stein, 1990). of these, the
best characterized is the sigma-1 receptor, a relatively

neuroactive steroids and sigma-1 receptors

(7 kbp long) for the human sigma-1 receptor is located
on human chromosome 9, band p13, a region reported to
be associated with many psychiatric disorders, such as
schizophrenia and personality disorder. this gene also
contains cytokine and steroid responsive elements.
sigma-1 receptors are widely distributed in organs of the
mammalian immune, reproductive, endocrine, and central nervous systems. for this reason, it has been hypothesized that sigma-1 receptors may play a pivotal role
in communications between the cns and these other
systems (su et al., 1988; wolfe and de_souza, 1993).
over the past few decades, evidence has been gathered to support the existence of fast, nongenomic actions of steroids in the modulation of neurotransmitters
in the mammalian brain (rupprecht et al., 1996; wehling, 1994). it is hypothesized that such effects are
mediated through cell surface membrane receptors
that may or may not be g-coupled. there is also evidence from pharmacological, electrophysiological, and
behavioral studies that certain neuroactive steroids act
as endogenous sigma-1 receptor ligands (maurice, 1999,
2001b, 2004; su and hayashi, 2003). of the steroids
examined thus far, progesterone binds with the highest
affinity, with reported values ranging from 30–300 nm.
also reported is that dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea)
potentiates nmda-induced neuronal responses via
sigma-1 receptors and this effect is suppressed by
progesterone and testosterone (bergeron et al., 1996;
debonnel et al., 1996; maurice et al., 1997). thus,
dhea acts as a sigma receptor agonist, and progesterone and testosterone as antagonists.
studies in rodents suggest that certain steroids bind
sigma-1 receptors and thereby influence processes central to memory and learning. maurice et al. used an ex
vivo method to demonstrate that the bound to free
ratios of sigma-1 receptor agonist tracer [3h]skf100,047 was significantly reduced (20–40%) by the
in vivo administration of progesterone in doses of 10–
40 mg/kg (maurice et al., 1996). this displacement
was apparently not strong enough to be obvious by typical dissection methods, necessitating an ex vivo analysis
including a wash of nonspecifically bound tracer and
determination of bound/free ratios. using this same
method, a separate study showed that [3h]skf-100,047
binding in the rodent brain was modified when the levels of endogenous progesterone were modified by castration/adrenalectomy in conjunction with enzymatic
manipulation (phan et al., 1999). as expected, [3h]skf100,047 binding in the brain (bound-to-free ratio) was
increased by decreasing progesterone levels but decreased when progesterone levels were increased. the
well-controlled manipulation of progesterone levels in
this model also effected sigma-1 receptor mediated behavior of the mice, which included changes in cognitive
function and learning deficits. several other reports
have linked sigma-1 receptors, and steroid binding at
sigma-1 receptors, to memory, learning and antidepres-

sant behaviors in rodents, and a number of reviews are
available (guitart et al., 2004; maurice, 2004; maurice
and lockhart, 1997; su and hayashi, 2003). proposed
mechanisms include, but are not limited to, modulation
of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems.
to evaluate the density and function of sigma-1 receptors in vivo by noninvasive imaging methods, we
have developed the sigma-1 receptor selective (ki
(sigma-2)/ki (sigma-1) ¼ 144) positron emission tomography (pet) radioligand, [18f]1-(3-fluoropropyl)-4-((4cyanophenox)methyl) piperidine, or [18f]fps (waterhouse and collier, 1997; waterhouse et al., 2000, 2002,
2004). from extensive screening in several dozen
in vitro competitive binding assays, fps did not exhibit high affinity binding (ki > 300 nm) to any other
receptor, transporter, or enzyme tested, including the
classical progesterone and estrogen receptors. we previously demonstrated that [18f]fps binding in vivo is
saturable and selective for sigma receptors in rats,
mice, and nonhuman primates (waterhouse et al.,
2002). through pet imaging studies, the regional distribution volume, and specific binding of [18f]fps, the
baboon brain has been documented. more recently, the
first safety assessments and brain imaging studies in
healthy humans were carried out (waterhouse et al.,
2004). this current study determines the effect of progesterone, dhea, and other steroids on [18f]fps binding in vitro and in vivo in healthy awake male rats.
materials and methods
general
chemicals, buffers, and other reagents, including
haloperidol, progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, estriol,
and dhea were purchased from sigma aldrich (st.
louis, mo) and were used without further purification.
all in vivo studies were carried out according to approved new york state psychiatric institute (nyspi),
animal care and use committee (iacuc), and united
states regulations.
radiolabeling and purification of [18f]fps
18

[ f]fps was synthesized, purified, analyzed, and formulated exactly as previously described (collier et al.,
1996). for these studies, the specific activity ranged
from 772–1890 mci/mmol, the radiochemical purity was
>98%, and no extraneous materials were detected during high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc)
quality control analyses.
in vitro binding assays

homogenizer (fisher scientific; 15 s, half-maximum
speed) in a 40-fold (w/v) excess of ice-cold potassium
phosphate buffer (50 nm, ph ¼ 8.0). a phosphate buffer
was used as suggested, since  xxxd3449xxx  was previously
shown to reduce the binding of sigma receptor radioligands in vitro (mccann and su, 1992). the homogenate
was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000g for 10 min at 48c using an
allegra 64r ultracentrifuge (beckman coulter). the
pellet was collected and resuspended in 30–40 vol (w/v)
of the same buffer, and centrifuged a second time. this
process was repeated twice more. pellets were stored
for up to 8 weeks at 808c. on the day of assay, resuspension of the final pellet in ice-cold phosphate buffer
(50 mm, ph ¼ 8.0) provided a final concentration of
30 mg membrane per 1 ml solution.
determination of inhibition constants
(ki values) for steroids
to confirm an appropriate incubation time for the
[18f]fps binding assay, an association experiment was
first performed. [18f]fps (1 nm, 0.5–1.0 mci/tube) in a
total volume of 1.0 ml phosphate buffer (ph ¼ 8.0, 22–
248c), with or without unlabeled fps (1 mm), was
incubated with forebrain membranes (3 mg/tube) for
various times between 4 min and 4 h. all conditions
were assayed in triplicate. the experiment was terminated by the addition of 3-ml ice cold phosphate buffer,
and unbound tracer further removed by washing twice
more (4 ml/wash) with cold phosphate buffer using a
48 well cell harvester (brandel). membranes were
placed into separate 7-ml tubes, and radioactivity assayed with a gamma counter (cobra ii, packard instruments). analysis of data for full assays was performed graphically to determine the time to peak binding, and the stability of binding. this information was
used to determine incubation time for subsequent kd
determinations and for competitive binding assays.
based on the results of the association experiment,
the radiotracer [18f]fps (1 nm, 0.5–1.0 mci/tube) was
incubated for 1.5 h in a total volume of 1.0 ml phosphate
buffer (ph ¼ 8.0, 228c, in the presence of forebrain
membranes (3 mg/tube). the effect of different concentrations of the known sigma compounds fps and haloperidol (1012 to 106 m) on [18f]fps specific binding
was examined. experiments were terminated by the
addition of 3-ml ice cold phosphate buffer, and unbound
tracer further removed by washing twice more (4 ml/
wash) with cold phosphate buffer using a 48-well cell
harvester (brandel). membranes were placed into separate 7-ml tubes, and radioactivity assayed with a gamma
counter (cobra ii, packard instruments).
analysis of binding data for full assays (fps kd
determination, and ki determination for other ligands)
was performed using nonlinear regression (prism
3.0.vx, graphpad) taking gamma counter efficiency
(17% for positrons) into account. all assays were performed in triplicate.

[ f]fps (15–20 mci, 100-ml saline with 2% ethanol (v/v)) was administered 10 min after injection of either carrier alone (saline/dmso, 65:35 v/v, 100 ml),
sigma-1 ligand, or steroid to awake 10–14 weeks old
male sprague dawley rats (225–280 g) via tail vein
injection. specifically, haloperidol (1 mg/kg, i.v.), fps
(1 mg/kg, i.v.), or steroid (progesterone (10 mg/kg), testosterone (20 mg/kg) or dhea (20 mg/kg)) were administered in carrier 20 min before [18f]fps. the
addition of dmso to saline was required to effect solubilization of steroids. administration of all agents took
place while the animals were awake but restrained by
an approved perspex holder. at 60 min postinjection of
[18f]fps, the rats were rendered unconscious with gas
anesthesia and killed by decapitation via guillotine.
whole blood, heart, lung, spleen, kidney, intestine,
and brain were retrieved postmortem. specific brain
regions were dissected over ice and analyzed, including the cerebellum, frontal cortex, occipital cortex, parietal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and
hypothalamus. all tissue samples were weighed and
assayed for radioactivity with a gamma counter (cobra
ii, packard instruments). the percent of injected dose
(%id) and the percent of injected dose per gram of tissue (%id/g) were determined for each sample by comparison with a 5% aliquot of the injected dose as a
standard. significant differences between control and
test groups were determined using a two-tailed t test.
the criterion for significance was p  0.05.

incubation time was set at 1.5 h, since peak binding
had occurred by this time and was relatively stable
(fig. 1). in a subsequent study, unlabeled fps was
tested against [18f]fps, and nonlinear regression methods were used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (kd), which was 0.5 nm for fps (fig. 2).
this kd value was used in the calculation of inhibition
constants (ki values) for other compounds and selected
steroids tested in competitive assays against [18f]fps.
it was found that haloperidol, progesterone, testosterone, and dhea reduced [18f]fps specific binding in
vitro, whereas estradiol and estriol did not (table i).
this is as expected based on previously published data,
and the affinity order of these compounds for sigma-1
receptors is generally the same as previously reported.
in vivo biodistribution studies
administration of unlabeled fps, haloperidol, progesterone, testosterone, or dhea significantly decreased
[18f]fps uptake in nearly all brain regions examined
(fig. 3). [18f]fps uptake in peripheral organs that express sigma receptors (heart, spleen, muscle, and lung)
was also reduced by the presence of sigma-1 receptor
binding steroids (54–85%; fig. 4), while blood radioactivity concentrations were not significantly different.
steroid solubility served to limit the administered mass
dose. in contrast, estradiol did not significantly reduce
[18f]fps uptake in any tissue assayed (data not shown).
these data clearly demonstrate that [18f]fps specific

binding in the cns and peripheral tissues is reduced in
the presence of exogenous progesterone, testosterone,
and dhea.

discussion
this article clearly demonstrates that [18f]fps
in vitro and in vivo binding is sensitive to the presence
of steroids with established sigma-1 receptor affinity.
this is hypothesized to stem from a direct competition
for binding to the sigma-1 receptor between these steroids and the radiotracer. these data provide further
validation of earlier studies suggesting that specific
neuroactive steroids, which administered exogenously
at doses utilized in this study, can occupy brain sigma1 receptors in rodents, lending credence to the involvement of these sites in the behavioral effects observed
(e.g., alleviation of nmda induced memory deficits by
dhea) (maurice, 2004; maurice et al., 1997, 1999,
2001a; maurice and lockhart, 1997; phan et al., 2002).
although not an unexpected finding, this is the first
published study demonstrating such effects on peripheral organs known to express sigma-1 receptors, such
as the heart, spleen, and lung. we also note that, in the
rodent brain, the reduction in [18f]fps binding induced by steroid administration was not as pronounced
as when fps or haloperidol was used for blocking. this
could be because of an administered steroid dose that is
less than the amount required to saturate the receptors. this is plausible since the sigma-1 receptor affinity of progesterone and other steroids is 10-fold or more
lower than that of fps or haloperidol. in addition, the
amount of steroid administered was limited by relatively low solubility in carrier. finally, it is likely that
progesterone and other steroids are rapidly metabolized through known enzymatic pathways, which would
result in a decrease in their cns free concentrations
over time. such effects would most likely be steroid

dependant and region specific, since steroid metabolism
is not homogenous throughout the brain.
there are several clear implications of these data for
pet imaging studies. first, it is now obvious that
menstrual cycle status should be carefully considered
when assessing sigma-1 receptors with [18f]fps or
other sigma-1 receptor tracers in females. one would
expect that, in the late luteal phase during peak progesterone plasma levels, its occupancy at sigma-1
receptors would be higher compared to all other
phases where progesterone plasma concentrations are
much lower. in addition, [18f]fps may provide an
effective tool for studying the mechanisms of neuroactive steroids on brain function. in fact, a well-controlled
study would provide insight into the status of these
receptors over the course of the menstrual cycle, potentially leading to insights into the known neurochemical
and physiological changes in women during the distinct
phases. given the fact that exogenous dhea, progesterone, testosterone, and some of their metabolic products (e.g., dhea sulfate and allopregnanolone) are
being evaluated in clinical trials for various indications,
one must consider the fact that part of their action may
be because of binding at sigma-1 receptors (dubrovsky,
synapse doi 10.1002/syn

2005; guitart et al., 2004; hayashi and su, 2004). pet
imaging studies in humans using a sigma-1 receptor
tracer sensitive to endogenous steroids is essential to
address this possibility. as one example, dhea has
recently been found to reduce depressive symptoms in
select patient populations including persons with schizophrenia (strous et al., 2003) and depression (rabkin
et al., 2006; schmidt et al., 2005). by performing drug
dose versus receptor occupancy assessments by pet,
[18f]fps could be used to determine if the action of
dhea may be due to occupancy of these sites, or not.
exogenous progesterone has been shown to reduce
craving for nicotine and cocaine (damaj, 2001; romieu
et al., 2003; sofuoglu et al., 2001, 2002, 2004). [18f]fps
pet imaging to confirm or eliminate sigma-1 receptors
in the mechanisms of action of progesterone could help
to design more selective, nonsteroidal effective treatments for addiction. these are just some of the possibilities that can now be addressed by imaging of sigma-1
receptors in animals and humans by noninvasive tomographic methods.
in addition to [18f]fps, a structurally similar single
photon emission computed tomography (single photon
emission computed tomography (spect)) radiotracer,

[123i]tpcne has just been evaluated in humans, and is
available for spect studies of these sites (stone et al.,
2006). because of the similar molecular structure of
[123i]tpcne compared to [18f]fps, it is expected that
this tracer would also be sensitive to occupancy of
sigma-1 receptors by steroids such as progesterone, testosterone, and dhea. however, this remains to be confirmed. finally, although only a couple of other sigma-1
receptor radioligands have been evaluated in man (mishina et al., 2005; van waarde et al., 2004), it is not
known if their binding is reduced in the presence of
specific steroids. thus, we conclude that it is important
to evaluate the effect of steroids on tracer binding during the preclinical development of sigma-1 receptor
radioligands, since the results would guide pet study
paradigm design, especially when evaluating this site
in female subjects.
