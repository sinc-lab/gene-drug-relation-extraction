1 in this study, we tested the eects of the stilbene disulphonates dids and sits on three dierent
types of cloned  xxxg1253xxx  ( xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ,  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and kir6.2dc) heterologously
expressed in xenopus oocytes, with the aim of identifying the part of the channel which is involved
in mediating disulphonate inhibition.
2 we found that the inhibitory site(s) for these drugs lies within the  xxxg1250xxx  subunit of the channel,
although its properties are further modulated by the sulphonylurea (sur) subunit. in particular,
sur2a reduces both the rate and extent of block, by impairing the ability of dids binding to
produce channel closure.
3 the disulphonate-binding site interacts with the atp inhibitory site on  xxxg1250xxx  because atp is
able to protect against irreversible channel inhibition by disulphonates. this eect is not mimicked
by  xxxd3394xxx  (at a concentration that interacts with  xxxg1250xxx ) and is abolished by mutations that
render the channel atp insensitive.
4 a number of point mutations in both the n and c termini of  xxxg1250xxx  reduced the extent and
reversibility of channel inhibition by sits. the results are consistent with the idea that residue c42
of  xxxg1250xxx  is likely to be involved in covalently linking of sits to the channel.
5 other types of kir channel ( xxxg1249xxx , kir2.1 and kir4.1) were also irreversibly blocked by dids,
suggesting that these channels may share common binding sites for these stilbene disulphonates.

introduction
in a variety of tissues, atp-sensitive k-channels (katp
channels) serve to couple electrical activity to the metabolic
state of the cell (ashcroft & gribble, 1998; 1999; aguilarbryan & bryan, 1999). in addition to metabolism, katp
channels are regulated by sulphonylurea drugs, which inhibit
channel activity and are used to enhance insulin secretion in
type-2 diabetes mellitus, and by  xxxg1253xxx  openers which
stimulate channel activity.
the  xxxg1253xxx  is an octameric (4 : 4) complex of two
structurally distinct proteins:  xxxg1250xxx , and sur (clement et al.,
1997; inagaki et al., 1997; shyng & nichols, 1997).  xxxg1250xxx  acts
as a common atp-sensitive pore while sur is a regulatory
subunit that endows  xxxg1250xxx  with sensitivity to metabolism,
sulphonylureas and katp-channel openers (nichols et al.,
1996; inagaki et al., 1996; shyng et al., 1997; tucker et al.,
1997). katp channels in pancreatic b-cells comprise  xxxg1250xxx 
and  xxxg19xxx  subunits (inagaki et al., 1995; sakura et al., 1995),
while those of cardiac and skeletal muscle are composed of
 xxxg1250xxx  and sur2a (inagaki et al., 1996). although wild-type
katp channels require both  xxxg1250xxx  and sur subunits for
functional activity, a mutant form of  xxxg1250xxx  with a c-terminal
truncation of 26 or 36 amino acids (kir6.2dc) is capable of
independent expression (tucker et al., 1997).

stilbene disulphonates are widely used as anion transport
inhibitors and anion channel blockers. these compounds
share structural similarities with sulphonylureas in that both
types of drug have benzene rings and sulphonic acid residues.
the latter observation led furukawa et al. (1993) to test the
eect of stilbene disulphonates on katp channels in
ventricular myocytes. they found that these drugs inhibited
katp channels when applied to the intracellular side of the
membrane with an order of potency dids (ic50 71 mm)4
sits*dnds4dads. the actions of dids and sits were
irreversible while those of dads and dnds were reversible.
the hill coecient was around unity suggesting that despite
the tetrameric nature of the  xxxg1253xxx  the interaction of a
single stilbene disulphonate molecule was sucient to cause
channel inhibition. the compounds inhibited  xxxg1253xxx 
activity without an obvious eect on the single-channel
current amplitude. analysis of the single-channel kinetics
revealed that dids reduced the duration of the burst of
openings characteristic of katp channels and increased the
long interburst closed time, consistent with the idea that the
compound can interact with both the open state and the long
closed state of the channel. the block was voltage independent
and did not require divalent cations.
stilbene disulphonates possessing scn groups, like dids
and sits, are known to react covalently with lysine or
cysteine residues (gatto et al., 1997). the ability of dids to
bind covalently to these residues is much greater than that of

sits, while dnds and dads do not have an scn group
that is able to bind covalently. the properties of stilbene
disulphonate block of katp channels reported by furukawa
et al. (1993) are consistent with the idea that irreversible
block of the channel by dids (or sits) is produced by a
covalent reaction between the scn group on the drug and
the  xxxg1253xxx . inhibition of the  xxxg1253xxx  by stilbene
disulphonates is thus likely to involve at least two steps: a
reversible binding of the drug to the channel, followed by a
covalent reaction that irreversibly attaches the stilbene
disulphonate.
in this study, we have tested the eects of the stilbene
disulphonates dids and sits on dierent types of cloned
katp channels heterologously expressed in xenopus oocytes,
with the aim of identifying which part of the channel is
involved in mediating disulphonate inhibition. we examined
whether the stilbene disulphonate-binding site is located on
the  xxxg1250xxx  or on the sur subunit. we explored the
relationship of the stilbene disulphonate-binding site to the
sulphonylurea- and atp-binding sites. and we investigated
the eect of a number of point lysine and cysteine mutations
in the n and c termini of the channel on the properties of
stilbene disulphonate block.

macroscopic currents were recorded from giant excised
inside-out patches at a holding potential of 760 mv using
an axopatch 200b patch-clamp ampli®er (axon instruments,
burlingame, u.s.a.). they were ®ltered at 0.2 khz, digitized
at 0.4 khz using a digidata 1200 interface and analysed
using pclamp software (axon instruments). single-channel
currents were recorded at 760 mv, ®ltered at 5 khz and
sampled at 20 hz.
the pipette (external) solution contained (mm): 140 kcl,
1.2 mgcl2, 2.6 cacl2, 10 hepes (ph 7.4 with koh). the
intracellular (bath) solution contained (mm): 135 kcl, 1
k2so4, 1 egta, 10 hepes (ph 7.2 with koh; ®nal
[k+]*140 mm). a mg2+-free solution was used to minimize
rundown (kozlowski & ashford, 1990): it has been shown
previously that this does not aect dids inhibition
(furukawa et al., 1993). dids and sits (sigma) were
dissolved directly in the solution prior to the experiment and
used the same day. experiments were carried out at 20 ±
248c. rapid exchange of solutions was achieved by
positioning the patch in the mouth of one of a series of
adjacent in¯ow pipes placed in the bath. patches were
exposed to 3 mm atp at intervals throughout the experiment, to monitor the zero current level and the patch
accessibility.

methods

data analysis

molecular biology

data are presented as mean+standard error of the mean.
the time course of dids (or sits) block was ®t with one or
more exponentials, using microcal origin. to evaluate the
extent of stilbene disulphonate block, or the degree of
recovery from block, we measured the steady-state current
during, or following, dids application. in most cases,
steady-state block was achieved within 1 min. where currents
showed substantial rundown (e.g. figure 6c), the peak value
was used (both in control and test solution).

mouse  xxxg1250xxx  (genbank d50581; inagaki et al., 1995; sakura
et al., 1995), rat  xxxg19xxx  (genbank l40624; aguilar-bryan et
al., 1995) and sur2a (genbank d83598; inagaki et al.,
1996) cdnas were cloned in the pbf vector. a truncated
form of  xxxg1250xxx  (kir6.2dc), which lacks the c-terminal 36
amino acids and forms functional channels in the absence of
sur, was prepared as described previously (tucker et al.,
1997). site-directed mutations in kir6.2dc were made using
the `quikchange' site-directed mutagenesis method (stratagene, la jolla, ca, u.s.a.). capped mrna was prepared
using the mmessage mmachine large scale in vitro
transcription kit (ambion, austin, tx, u.s.a.), as previously
described (gribble et al., 1997a).

oocyte collection
female xenopus laevis were anaesthetized with ms222
(2 g l71 added to the water). one ovary was removed via a
mini-laparotomy, the incision sutured and the animal allowed
to recover. immature stage v-vi oocytes were incubated for
60 min with 1.0 mg mg71 collagenase (sigma, type v) and
manually defolliculated. oocytes were either injected with
*1 ng kir6.2dc mrna (wild-type or mutant) or coinjected
with *0.1 ng  xxxg1250xxx  or kir6.2dc mrna (wild-type or
mutant) and *2 ng of mrna encoding either  xxxg19xxx  or
sur2a. the ®nal injection volume was 50 nl per oocyte.
isolated oocytes were maintained in barth's solution and
studied 1 ± 4 days after injection (gribble et al., 1997a).

electrophysiology
patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had
resistances of 250 ± 500 ko when ®lled with pipette solution.

results
macroscopic currents were recorded in inside-out membrane
patches from xenopus oocytes expressing kir6.2dc or
coexpressing  xxxg1250xxx  and either  xxxg19xxx  or sur2a. in all
cases, the currents were small in the cell-attached con®guration but increased markedly when the patch was excised into
nucleotide-free solution, consistent with the idea that the
 xxxg1253xxx  is blocked in the intact oocyte by cytoplasmic
nucleotides such as atp.
figure 1 shows that application of dids (0.7 mm) to the
intracellular membrane surface irreversibly inhibited all three
types of  xxxg1253xxx . kir6.2dc channels were blocked by
99+2% (n=6), indicating that dids interacts directly with
the  xxxg1250xxx  subunit. both  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a
currents were also blocked by dids. the mean extent of
steady-state block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents was 99.6+0.3%
(n=5) and that of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents was 77+5%
(n=8). thus the presence of sur2a, but not  xxxg19xxx ,
somehow decreases the extent of block. as in the case of
dids, sits (1 mm) completely and irreversibly blocked
both kir6.2dc and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents (by 98.8+0.1%
(n=5) and 98.9+0.1% (n=6), respectively; (see figures 4
and 6a).

currents recorded from inside-out patches at a holding potential of
760 mv from oocytes expressing kir6.2dc (a) or coexpressing
 xxxg1250xxx  and either  xxxg19xxx  (b) or sur2a (c). dids (0.7 mm) or atp
(3 mm) were added as indicated by the bars. the dashed line
indicates the zero current level. note the dierent time scale in c.

the time course of the onset of dids block of kir6.2dc
or  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents could be reasonably well ®tted by a
single exponential with a time constant (t) of 4.4+1.5 s
(n=6) for kir6.2dc and of 6.3+1.1 s (n=5) for  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx . these values are not signi®cantly dierent. in the case
of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents, the onset of inhibition did not
always follow a single exponential (n=3 out of eight
patches). we therefore ®tted the time course of  xxxg1250xxx /
sur2a block in all patches with the sum of two
exponentials: these had mean time constants of 12.9+3.1 s
(t1) and of 94.8+14.4 s (t2) and mean amplitudes of 50+6%
each (n=8). no recovery of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents was
observed when dids was removed during the initial phase of
block, at a time when inhibition was dominated by the fast
exponential, indicating that both the fast and slow block
represent irreversible reactions. these results indicate that
whereas the presence of  xxxg19xxx  does not alter the rate of
dids block, sur2a markedly slows the rate of inhibition.
when the dids concentration was reduced 10 fold (to
70 mm) both kir6.2dc and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents were still

fully blocked ± by 98.3+1.5% (n=5) and 97.8+1.7%
(n=5), respectively ± consistent with the idea that dids
interacts covalently with the  xxxg1253xxx . however, the rate
of block was slowed, the time constant being 77+12 s (n=5;
p50.001) for kir6.2dc and 33.1+5.9 s (n=5; p50.001) for
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx . a 10 fold reduction in dids concentration
slightly decreased the extent of block of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a
channels: from 77+5% (n=8) to 67+13% (n=5, n.s.). the
fast time constant was also slowed (t1=24+5 s, n=5;
p50.001 against 700 mm dids) but the slow time constant
was unaected (t2=75+32 s, n=5).
as described above, dids did not completely block
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents. the residual (unblocked) current
showed a reduced sensitivity to atp (figure 1c), the
inhibitory eect of 3 mm atp being reduced from
99.4+0.5% (n=8) in the absence of dids to 30+24%
(n=5) in its presence. it is clear from the large standard error
that the extent of atp inhibition after dids application was
quite variable: indeed in two experiments, 3 mm atp
activated instead of inhibiting the channel. atp has multiple
eects on the  xxxg1253xxx  (aguilar-bryan & bryan, 1999;
ashcroft & gribble, 1999). it blocks the channel by
interaction with a site on  xxxg1250xxx . it also activates the
channel, by several mechanisms. these include interaction
with the nucleotide-binding domains of sur; and generation
of phospholipids such as pip2 that stimulate channel activity
and reduce rundown.  xxxg1253xxx  activity in the presence
of mgatp is determined by the balance between these
stimulatory and inhibitory eects. channel activation by
atp following dids application might therefore be due to a
reduced atp inhibition, or to enhanced stimulatory eects.
the onset of atp block was also slower in the presence of
dids (figure 1c), the time constant increasing from
0.23+0.03 to 13.3+3.8 s (n=6; p50.001). this suggests
there may be an interaction between the atp- and didsbinding sites.

interactions of the dids- and atp-binding sites
to investigate this possibility further, we examined whether
the presence of atp was able to protect against dids block.
we ®rst applied 3 mm atp and then added 0.7 mm dids;
both agents were subsequently removed at the same time. we
found that atp prevented the irreversible block of both
kir6.2dc and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents by dids (figure 2a,b).
the percentage recovery following removal of atp and
dids was 26+12% (n=4) and 24+6% (n=4) for kir6.2dc
and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx , respectively, compared with no recovery at
all following dids removal when atp was absent. the
ability of atp to protect against irreversible inhibition by
dids suggests that atp either physically impedes the access
of dids to its binding site, electrostatically impedes its
access, or allosterically induces a conformational change in
 xxxg1250xxx  that renders the dids-binding site less accessible.
to con®rm that the site at which atp protects against
dids inhibition is the same as that at which atp mediates
channel inhibition, we examined a mutant form of  xxxg1250xxx 
(kir6.2dc-k185e) that shows reduced atp sensitivity
(reimann et al., 1999) and decreased atp binding (tanabe
et al., 1999). in contrast to the wild-type channel, atp did
not protect against dids block of kir6.2dc-k185e currents
(figure 2c). this adds further support to the idea that atp

dent while the atp- and disulphonate-binding sites can
interact (either directly or indirectly). it also provides
additional evidence that the atp-binding site and the lowanity sulphonylurea site on  xxxg1250xxx  are not identical. it
further suggests that either the closed states produced by
atp and  xxxd3394xxx  are dierent (so that the dids site is
accessible when  xxxd3394xxx  closes the channel but not when
atp does); or that bound atp physically impedes access to
the dids-binding site while  xxxd3394xxx  does not.

effects of point mutations in  xxxg1250xxx 

figure 2 atp protects against irreversible dids block. macroscopic currents recorded at 760 mv in inside-out patches from
oocytes expressing kir6.2dc (a), or coexpressing sur 1 and either
wild-type (b,d) or mutant (c)  xxxg1250xxx . atp (3 mm), dids (0.7 mm)
or  xxxd3394xxx  (10 mm) were added as indicated by the bars. the
dashed line indicates the zero current level.

interaction with the atp-inhibitory site on  xxxg1250xxx  protects
against dids block. the time constant of dids block was
signi®cantly (p50.001) slowed: from 4.4+1.5 s (n=6) for the
wild-type kir6.2dc to 18.3+3.2 s (n=5) for the kir6.2dck185e mutant. this result suggests that mutations aecting
atp sensitivity may also alter the properties of dids block.
this is consistent with the idea that the two binding sites lie
in close physical proximity.
in contrast to atp, application of the inhibitory
sulphonylurea  xxxd3394xxx  (10 mm), did not prevent the
irreversible block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents by dids
(percentage recovery, 0.4+0.3%; n=5), as shown in figure
2d. the high  xxxd3394xxx  concentration used in this
experiment (10 mm) would be sucient to interact with the
low-anity sulphonylurea site on  xxxg1250xxx  (gribble et al.,
1997b). taken together with the eect of atp on dids
inhibition, therefore, this result suggests that the sulphonylurea- and disulphonate-binding sites on  xxxg1250xxx  are indepenbritish journal of pharmacology vol 132 (5)

we next mutated, one at a time, each of the lysine and
cysteine residues in the n and c termini of  xxxg1250xxx  and
analysed the eect of these mutations on the ability of dids
and sits to inhibit the channel. because some mutations did
not express sucient current when mutant kir6.2dc was
expressed alone, most mutations were made in full length
 xxxg1250xxx  which was then coexpressed with  xxxg19xxx . this strategy
ensured that only fully coupled octameric channels reached
the surface membrane (zerangue et al., 1999). in all but two
cases (c166s, k67q, see below), the properties of the dids
inhibition were unaected (figure 3). in contrast, most point
mutations reduced the extent of block by 1 mm sits and/or
enhanced its reversibility (figures 4 and 5). for example,
mutation of lysine 332 to asparagine (k332n) resulted in a
much smaller block that was now almost fully reversible
(figures 4 and 6b), while the mutation k207n markedly
increased the reversibility of block without aecting its
magnitude (figures 4 and 6c). some mutations also aected
the extent and/or reversibility of block by 10 mm sits: those
that rendered the block reversible were concentrated in the n
terminus of the channel (figure 5).
mutation of cysteine 166 to serine in  xxxg1250xxx  markedly
enhances the channel open probability (trapp et al., 1998a).
this mutation also reduced the rate of dids block of both
kir6.2dc and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents (figure 7a,b). the time
course of the block of kir6.2dc-c166s currents by 0.7 mm
dids was ®t by a single exponential with a time constant of
33.1+9.1 s (n=5), about eight times slower than that found
for wild-type kir6.2dc (*4 s). as expected for a covalent
reaction, however, the magnitude of the dids block was
unaected, being 97.8+1.4% (n=5) for kir6.2dc-c166s
currents compared with 99% for the wild-type channel. sits
had no obvious eect on kir6.2dc-c166s currents at a
concentration of 1 mm but  xxxd1891xxx  mm it completely blocked
the current (99.3+0.7% block, n=4).
when kir6.2dc-c166s was coexpressed with  xxxg19xxx ,
0.7 mm dids only inhibited the mutant channel by
45+13% (n=4), and a distinct component of unblocked
current was observed (figure 7b). the rate of block was best
®tted by the sum of two exponentials with time constants
t1=9.8+1.0 s and t2=53.6+7.9 s, and amplitudes
a1=0.45+0.21 and a2=0.55+0.21, respectively (n=4).
kir6.2dc-c166s channels were fully blocked by dids, so
that the failure of dids to block  xxxg1250xxx -c166s/ xxxg19xxx 
currents must be related to the presence of the sulphonylurea
receptor. in contrast, the extent of block by 10 mm sits was
similar to that observed in the absence of  xxxg19xxx , but the
onset of block was slowed: t increased from 14+3 s (n=4) to
43+15 s (n=4) when kir6.2dc-c166s was coexpressed with
 xxxg19xxx .

number of patches ranged between 3 ± 6 for each mutant. currents were not corrected for rundown.

at the single-channel level, kir6.2dc-c166s channels are
characterized by very long bursts of openings and rare longlasting interburst closings which account for 50.5% of the
total closed time (trapp et al., 1998a). dids (0.7 mm)
caused the channel to enter the long closed state, but several
re-openings were observed before it was ®nally irreversibly
inhibited (figure 7c). similar results were observed for native
cardiac channels (furukawa et al., 1993). this indicates that
for a short time, at least, the channel is able to re-open after
binding dids.
mutation of lysine 67 to glutamine (k67q) markedly
reduced the extent of sits block and rendered inhibition
rapidly reversible (figure 8b). a substantial recovery of
current was also observed when dids was removed (figure
8c), although the rate of recovery was slow. mutation of
k67 to methionine or asparagine was without eect on dids
block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels. as dids is not expected to
bind covalently to these amino acids, the eects of the k67q

mutation must be mediated allosterically. the k67q
mutation did not signi®cantly aect the atp-sensitivity of
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents (data not shown), suggesting that the
atp- and dids-binding sites are not identical. when kir6.2k67q was coexpressed with sur2a (rather than  xxxg19xxx ), the
dids block was fast and was usually fully reversible (data
not shown). this suggests that dids does not interact
covalently with  xxxg1250xxx -k67q/sur2a and is consistent with
studies on wild-type channels showing that sur2a compromises dids block.
although the extent of inhibition of kir6.2dc-42a/ xxxg19xxx 
currents by sits was similar to that of wild-type channels,
the block was no longer irreversible (figure 8a). this
suggests that c42 may participate in a covalent reaction
with sits and is consistent with the fact that mutation of
this n-terminal residue abolishes sensitivity to thiol reagents
(trapp et al., 1998b). we also observed that after removal of
sits and partial recovery of the current, subsequent

application of 3 mm atp resulted in a further increase in
current when atp was removed (e.g. figure 8a). because
these experiments were carried out in mg-free solution, this
increase cannot be due to channel `reactivation', as this
phenomenon requires mg2+ (ohno-shosaku et al., 1987). it is
possible that atp may accelerate the unbinding of sits
from the mutant channel, consistent with the idea that the
sits- and atp-binding sites interact. for example, atp
may induce an allosteric conformational change in  xxxg1250xxx 
that in¯uences the structure of the sits-binding site, thereby
displacing the stilbene disulphonate.

effects of dids on other inward rectifiers
finally, we tested the eect of intracellular dids (0.7 mm)
on the related inward recti®ers  xxxg1249xxx , kir2.1 and kir4.1. all
were fully and irreversibly blocked (data not shown). the fact
that dids blocks several types of inward recti®ers suggests
that they share a common binding site(s) for stilbene
british journal of pharmacology vol 132 (5)

derivatives. it is possible that the cysteine residue equivalent
to c42 in  xxxg1250xxx , which is shared by all kir channels, may
contribute to this binding site.

discussion
site of action
our results suggest that despite their structural similarity
to sulphonylureas, stilbene disulphonates do not block
katp channels by interaction with the sulphonylurea
receptor subunit. rather they interact with the  xxxg1250xxx 
subunit of the channel. it is also theoretically possible that
they bind to some other protein that is endogenously
expressed in oocytes and that modulates the activity of
 xxxg1250xxx , but this seems less likely because mutations in
 xxxg1250xxx  alter both the rate and extent of block by stilbene
disulphonates.

mutant  xxxg1250xxx , as indicated. the number of patches ranged between 3 ± 6 for each mutant. currents were not corrected for
rundown.

our data suggest that stilbene disulphonates such as dids
or sits are common inhibitors of the inward recti®er
channel family. in addition, they block other types of ion
channel, such as chloride channels. this promiscuity means
they are not suitable as pharmacological blockers for
evaluation of the physiological roles of ion channels.
however, their ability to form covalent bonds with lysine
and cysteine residues can be exploited for structure-function
studies.

regulation by sur
it seems probable that the time course of dids block of the
katp current represents the rate of the covalent reaction of
the stilbene disulphonate with the channel, because there was
no recovery when dids was removed and because atp was
unable to reactivate the channel if it was applied after dids.
both of these eects would be expected if dids bound
reversibly to the channel. the slower rate of dids block

observed for  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents suggests that the
covalent reaction occurs much more slowly when sur2a is
present. this might indicate that sur2a (but not  xxxg19xxx )
reduces access of dids to its binding site, or accelerates the
o-rate of dids from its binding site so that the covalent
reaction occurs with lower frequency. the fact that two
exponentials are required to ®t the time course of block of
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents further suggests that more than one
covalent reaction takes place. it is not clear whether this is
also the case for kir6.2dc/ xxxg19xxx , as the data could be ®tted
with a single exponential time course.
there are at least two explanations for the pedestal
observed for  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents. first, dids may not
bind to all channels. secondly, dids may bind to all
channels but not block them completely; a more elaborate
version of this idea would be that the channels remain open
when dids binds but are closed when the covalent reaction
takes place, and that not all channels undergo the covalent
reaction. our results favour the idea that dids is covalently

bound to all channels because both the rate and extent of
atp inhibition is impaired, even after dids is removed
(figure 1). this implies that dids remains linked to the
channel even after washing with control solution. we
therefore conclude that even though dids is covalently
linked to  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a the channel does not completely
close. because no residual pedestal of current is observed for
kir6.2dc, this implies that sur2a must impair the
transduction of dids binding into closure of the  xxxg1250xxx 
pore.
although  xxxg19xxx  did not modify dids block of wild-type
 xxxg1250xxx , it markedly aected the dids block of the mutant
channel  xxxg1250xxx -c166s, as discussed below. it is perhaps worth
noting that this is not the only example of such modulation ±
the atp block of  xxxg1250xxx  is also in¯uenced by  xxxg19xxx , although
in this case inhibition is enhanced (tucker et al., 1997).

effects of gating
there is evidence that the dids binding site is accessible
when the channel is closed, because  xxxd3394xxx  does not
protect against dids inhibition. there is also evidence that
dids can bind to the open state since it reduces the burst
duration in single-channel recordings of both wild-type

(furukawa et al., 1993) and mutant channels (figure 7).
thus dids binding appears to be independent of whether
the channel is open or closed.
kir6.2dc-c166s currents are characterized by prolonged
bursts of opening with very few long closed states (trapp et
al., 1998a). the fact that the rate of dids block was slower
for kir6.2dc-c166s currents is consistent with the idea that
dids block is in¯uenced by the rate of transition between
the open and long closed states, as is the case for atp
(trapp et al., 1998a). however, the fact that kir6.2dcc166s/ xxxg19xxx  currents also show a decreased steady-state
block cannot be explained merely by eects on gating. it
appears that, as is the case of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a, the
transduction between the dids-binding site and the channel
gate is impaired, enabling the channel to reopen with dids
bound to it.

effects of  xxxg1250xxx  mutations
the block by dids and sits is voltage-independent, and is
therefore unlikely to lie within the pore of  xxxg1250xxx .
furthermore, mutation of c81, which lies within the ®rst
transmembrane domain of the channel, had no apparent
eect on disulphonate inhibition. both sits and dids are
membrane impermeant and are eective when added to the
intracellular solution. thus, they must react with the
cytosolic domains of the channel.

as indicated by the bars. the dashed line indicates the zero current
level.

because covalent reaction of stilbene disulphonates is
thought to involve lysine or cysteine residues, we mutated
every lysine and cysteine lying within the intracellular n and
c terminus of  xxxg1250xxx . although only two mutations aected
dids block, a large number of mutations had eects on
sits block (especially at mm concentration). there are a
number of possible explanations for this ®nding. first,
multiple residues may contribute to the stilbene disulphonate-binding site. secondly, some mutations may in¯uence
the single-channel kinetics and aect stilbene disulphonate
block by an indirect mechanism (as in the case for c166).
thirdly, since stilbene disulphonates are negatively charged,
neutralization of lysine residues might in¯uence electrostatic
interactions between these compounds and the channel. this
may explain why some mutations slowed the time-course of
channel inhibition (e.g. mutation k185e, figure 2c).
fourthly, sits may interact directly with only a few residues,
but these may be located in a dierent part of the protein and
brought into proximity by folding of the n and c terminal
cytosolic domains. consequently, mutations in many residues

dids block of katp channels

981

might perturb protein folding and thereby allosterically
decrease binding.
the fact that no single point mutation abolished the
irreversible block by dids argues that more than one
cysteine or lysine residue forms a covalent link with this
compound. this is also supported by the fact that the block
of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents follows a double exponential time
course. because many mutations disrupt sits block, we
suggest that the n and c terminus may interact to produce a
highly de®ned structure and some mutations may in¯uence
sits binding allosterically. the fact that many mutations
aect sits but not dids block may be explained by the
much lower ability of sits to form covalent bonds
(cabantchik & rothstein, 1972). previous studies with sits
in a variety of biological systems have shown that this
compound must ®rst bind tightly to its binding site before a
second, slower, covalent reaction can occur. compared to
dids, the covalent reaction is slower, less eective and can
frequently be reversed by prolonged washing. point mutations in the n and c terminus that disrupt the binding site
for sits will therefore also prevent the covalent reaction
from occurring.
a number of mutations aected the reversibility of sits
block. the most interesting of these is c42a which did not
alter the extent of block, yet rendered the block almost fully
reversible. this suggests that c42 may be the residue with
which sits forms a covalent reaction, an idea that is in
agreement with previous studies which have implicated c42a
in block by sulfhydryl reagents (trapp et al., 1998b).
however, sits clearly reacts with additional residues to
block the channel because the c42a mutation does not
in¯uence the extent of block. furthermore, although dids
and sits might be expected to form a covalent reaction with
the same residue(s), the c42a mutation only aected the
reversibility of sits block and not that of dids. this
suggests that an additional residue(s) is involved in the
covalent reaction with dids.
the k67q mutation substantially reduced sits block. in
contrast, the amplitude of dids inhibition was unaected,
although the block was rendered slowly reversible. this eect
appears to be allosteric, because mutation of k67 to
methionine or asparagine had no apparent eect on dids
inhibition. the k67q mutation also reduced the functional
expression of the channel which might indicate that it caused
a change in the channel conformation.
it is of interest that mutations which reduce the ability of
sits to inhibit the channel irreversibly cluster in the n
terminus, in a region which has been shown to interact with
the c terminus of the channel (tucker & ashcroft, 1999).

interactions between the atp and dids binding sites
our results demonstrate that atp protects against irreversible block of the channel by dids. mutation of k185 in
 xxxg1250xxx  to glutamine, which reduces atp-inhibition of the
channel (tucker et al., 1997) and atp-binding to  xxxg1250xxx 
(tanabe et al., 1999), abolishes the protective eect of atp.
this suggests that access of dids to its binding site is
decreased when atp is bound to  xxxg1250xxx . similarly, the rate
and extent of block of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents by atp is
dramatically reduced in the presence of dids. a number of
mutations that alter sits block also aected the channel

atp-sensitivity (tucker et al., 1998; drain et al., 1998).
taken together, these results provide strong support for the
idea that the atp- and stilbene disulphonate-binding sites
interact. they are therefore likely to lie close together, but
they are not identical because mutations such as k67q,
which aect dids block, do not in¯uence atp inhibition.
we also observed that when atp is added soon after
dids application it causes a fast and extensive inhibition of
the channel, whereas when atp is added later and greater
dids inhibition has occurred, the inhibition by atp is
slower and less complete (data not shown). this is consistent
with the idea that the time course of dids block represents
the rate of binding of dids to the channel: the more drug

dids block of katp channels

molecules that have bound to the channel, the lower the
anity for atp (likewise the more channels that have bound
dids, the fewer available to bind atp).
in conclusion, our results argue that the binding site for
dids is likely to lie close to that for atp. because dids
binds irreversibly to the protein, and because it can be readily
obtained in radiolabeled form, dids may be a useful tool for
identifying the atp-binding site.
