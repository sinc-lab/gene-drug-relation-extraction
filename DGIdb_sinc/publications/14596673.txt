abstract
the c-erba gene encodes two thyroid hormone receptors, tr1 and tr2, that arise from alternative splicing
of the tr pre-mrna. tr2 is not able to bind
triiodothyronine (t3) and acts as a weak antagonist of trs.
it has been suggested that the balance of tr1 to tr2
is important in maintaining homeostasis. here, we study
the eﬀect of thyroid hormone on the splicing of tr
under various conditions in hepg2 cells. first, t3 was
added to hepg2 cells that endogenously express tr.
this resulted in a decrease in the tr1:tr2 mrna
ratio after the addition of 10 8 m or 10 7 m t3. then,
hepg2 cells were incubated with sera from hypothyroid
or hyperthyroid patients. sera from hyperthyroid patients
(n=6) decreased the tr1:tr2 ratio compared with
hepg2 cells incubated with sera from euthyroid patients
(n=8). sera from hypothyroid patients (n=6) had no eﬀect
on the tr1:tr2 ratio but supplementation with t3
caused a decrease in the ratio. finally, we tested sera from
patients with nonthyroidal illness (nti; n=17) which
showed no eﬀect on tr splicing when compared with

controls. free thyroxine levels in sera from hypo-, eu-, and
hyperthyroid patients, but not that of nti patients, were
negatively correlated (p,0·01) to the tr1:tr2 ratio.
we next studied the expression of the splicing factors
hnrnp a1 and asf/sf2 (sf2) in relation to the splicing
of the tr gene. in hepg2 cells incubated with nti sera
a negative relationship was found between the ratio of
hnrnp a1:sf2 and the tr1:tr2 ratio. a high
hnrnp a1:sf2 ratio is associated with the use of the distal
5 -splice site. the splicing direction should then change
towards tr2, which is indeed the case. rev-erba,
which is partly complementary to tr2 and could
therefore interfere in the splicing process, did not relate to
the tr1:tr2 ratio.
in conclusion, high t3 levels induce a low tr1:tr2
ratio which could protect the cell from excessive
t3-induced gene expression. in vivo, this might be a
mechanism to keep tissues relatively euthyroid during
high serum t3 levels.

introduction

both hypo- and hyperthyroidism (salto et al. 2001). a
disturbance in the balance of the tr1:tr2 ratio may
be responsible for the changes in thyroid hormone sensitivity of the diﬀerent tissues. moreover, mice that lack all
tr isoforms have an increased sensitivity to thyroid
hormone, possibly due to the absence of the silencing
eﬀect of the dominant negative tr2 (macchia et al.
2001). we hypothesized that t3 might have an eﬀect on
the alternative splicing of tr mrna by changing the
balance towards tr2 in the case of high t3 levels. this
might then counterbalance excessive t3-induced gene
transcription during hyperthyroid conditions. we therefore tested the eﬀect of the addition of t3 on endogenously
expressed tr1 and tr2 in hepg2 cells. subsequently, we also looked at the eﬀect of adding sera from
patients who were hyperthyroid or hypothyroid. we used
hepg2 cells as a model, for these cells have previously
been used to study the uptake, metabolism and action
of thyroid hormone and have proven to be a suitable
model for thyroid hormone handling by the human liver

thyroid hormone exerts its actions primarily by binding to
thyroid hormone receptors (trs) that bind to thyroid
hormone response elements in the regulatory region of a
gene thereby modifying gene expression. five diﬀerent
tr isoforms are known (1, 2, 1, 2, 3) which are
derived from the genes c-erba and c-erba respectively
(lazar 1993, williams 2000). the c-erba gene encodes
two variants that diﬀer at their c-terminal end by the use
of an alternative splice site in exon 9. tr1 is a functional
receptor that binds triiodothyronine (t3) whereas tr2
does not bind t3 and may have a dominant negative eﬀect.
tr2 can exert its dominant negative activity either by
competing for tr binding to thyroid hormone response
elements (tres) on dna (mitsuhashi et al. 1988,
burgos-trinidad & koenig 1999) or via other mechanisms
that do not require binding to a tre (liu et al. 1995).
tr2 / mice overexpress tr1 and are hypothyroid but show a complex phenotype with features of

· t3 affects the splicing of tr mrna

(bartalena et al. 1992, van stralen et al. 1996). induction of
the low t3 syndrome in rats by fasting alters the balance
between tr1 and tr2 in liver due to increased
expression of tr2 (bakker et al. 1998). this leads to the
hypothesis that serum from patients with nonthyroidal
illness (nti) might also have an eﬀect on the splicing
process of tr and therefore we also tested sera of nti
patients in our hepg2 model.
it is likely that there is a control of tr1 and tr2
mrna levels by regulation of alternative splicing of the
tr pre-mrna, and splicing factors may play a role in
the selection of the alternative splice site of the tr
pre-mrna. certain components of the general splicing
mechanism, such as the family of serine-arginine (sr)
proteins, aﬀect splice site selection in a dose-dependent
manner; they are counteracted by hnrnp a1 and related
proteins (mayeda & krainer 1992, hanamura et al. 1998).
the ratio of sr proteins and hnrnp a1-like proteins is
therefore an important determinant for alternative 5 splice-site selection in transfected cells (caceres et al.
1994). the identification of a splicing enhancer element
(se2) within the final intron of tr2 mrna that
stimulates tr2 mrna splicing and interacts with
asf:sf2 (sf2) supports the idea that these splicing factors
are involved (hastings et al. 2001).
another interesting feature of the erba locus is the
presence of a third gene, rev-erba (reverb), encoded
on the opposite strand of the erba (lazar et al. 1989).
the 3 -end of reverb overlaps with sequences coding for
tr2 but not for tr1. the fact that reverb mrna is
partially complementary to tr2 mrna could indicate
that it is involved in a possible regulatory mechanism for
tr mrna processing. in vitro splicing towards tr2
pre-mrna is inhibited by the addition of an excess of
antisense rnas containing the 3 -end of reverb mrna
(munroe & lazar 1991). reverb is also associated with an
increase in the ratio of tr1 to tr2 mrna in
diﬀerentiating adipocytes (chawla & lazar 1993). consequently, another study aim was to evaluate possible
involvement of sf2, hnrnp a1 and reverb in the
splicing process of tr pre-mrna.
patients and methods
materials and methods
materials t3 was obtained from sigma chemical co.
(st louis, mo, usa) and dissolved in 5 mm naoh to a
concentration of 1 mg/ml. it was further diluted in
e/mem (biowhittaker, verviers, belgium) and stored
at 20 c.
cell culture the human hepatoma cell line, hepg2, was
obtained from the atcc (#hb 8065, american type
culture collection, rockville, md, usa). for the first
experiment cells were cultured in e/mem supplemented
journal of endocrinology (2003) 179, 217–225

with 10 u/ml penicillin/streptomycin/ xxxd164xxx  (p/s/f)
and 5% fetal calf serum (fcs) (all from biowhittaker).
cells were plated in 6-well plates and reached approximately 70% confluence after 18 h. medium was then
changed to incubation medium with 5% fcs and an
increasing amount of t3 (10 9 to 10 7 m). hepg2 cells
were incubated with each concentration of t3 (repeated
six times) for a further 24 h after which rna was isolated.
the second experiment was performed with sera from
hypothyroid and hyperthyroid patients and euthyroid
controls. hepg2 cells were incubated in 24-well plates
containing e/mem supplemented with 10 u/ml p/s/f
and 10% serum. each serum sample was tested in duplicate
for 24 h.
in the third experiment sera from two hypothyroid
patients were tested in triplicate with increasing amounts
of t3 (10 9 to 10 7 m).
in the fourth experiment we incubated hepg2 cells
with e/mem containing 10 u/ml p/s/f and 10% serum
from nti patients (groups ii and iii) or healthy controls
(group i). we isolated cells after 5, 10 and 24 h incubation.
all samples in this experiment were tested in triplicate.
sera were assayed in four separate runs; each run contained
2 serum samples from groups i-iii.
patients sera were collected from 8 healthy volunteers,
6 hypothyroid ( xxxd3368xxx  (tsh) .4 mu/l, free thyroxine (ft4) ,10 pmol/l) patients and 6 hyperthyroid
(tsh ,0·4 mu/l, ft4 .23 pmol/l) patients.
additionally, we collected sera from 24 patients hospitalized at the department of internal medicine of our
institute. excluded were patients with thyroid or
pituitary/hypothalamic diseases, or those using drugs
known to interfere with thyroid hormone metabolism or
regulation. diagnoses of the patients admitted to the study
were: infectious disease (n=7), renal insuﬃciency (n=6),
cancer (n=5), liver disease (n=2), multiple sclerosis
(n=1), gastrointestinal disease (n=2) and venous thrombosis (n=1). sera from 8 healthy volunteers acted as
controls in this experiment (group i). sera of patients were
divided into two groups: group ii with normal serum t3
and t4 levels (t3 d1·3 nmol/l, t4  xxxd75xxx  nmol/l, n=7)
and group iii with subnormal t3 and normal or subnormal
t4 levels (t3 ,1·3 nmol/l, n=17). sera were stored
at 20 c.
assays serum t3 and t4 were measured with in-house
rias (wiersinga & chopra 1982). free t4 was measured
by a two-step fluoroimmunoassay (delfia; wallac,
turku, finland). tsh was measured with an immunofluorometric assay (delfia). a commercial enzyme
immunoassay (pelikine compact human il-6 elisa
kit, clb, amsterdam, the netherlands) was used to
measure interleukin-6 (il-6) with a sensitivity of 0·5–
1 pg/ml.

t3 affects the splicing of tr mrna

rt-pcr total rna was isolated with the rneasy
isolation system (qiagen gmbh, hilden, germany) and
reverse transcribed into single-stranded cdna using the
first strand cdna synthesis kit with random primers
(roche molecular biochemicals, mannheim, germany).
real-time pcr reactions were performed in a lightcycler (roche molecular biochemicals). tr1 and
tr2 were simultaneously detected in the same sample
using sequence-specific hybridization probes and a
lightcycler-faststart dna master hybridization probes
kit (roche). probes, primers and program were as previously described (bakker 2001). -actin, hnrnp a1 and
sf2 were measured using the lightcycler-dna master
sybr green kit and reverb with the lightcycler
faststart dna master sybr green kit. we designed
primer pairs for hnrnp a1 (sense: 5 -catgactgac
cgaggcagtg-3 ; antisense: 5 -ggctggatgaag
cactagcc-3 ) and reverb (sense: 5 -gctcgggc
atggagaattc-3 ; antisense: 5 -ccagaggctca
tcttggaat-3 ). specificity of the product was
checked by gel electrophoresis. primers for asf:sf2 and
-actin were as described (bouaboula et al. 1992, bai et al.
1999). for each mrna assayed, a sequence-specific
standard was generated and used in the range of 0·1–
1000 fg/20 µl. the pcr reactions were cycled with the
following programs: -actin: denaturation at 95 c for
10 s, 45 cycles of 0 s at 95 c, 5 s at 52 c, 10 s at 72 c;
hnrnp a1: denaturation at 95 c for 10 s, 45 cycles of
0 s at 95 c, 5 s at 50 c, 10 s at 72 c; and sf2: 95 c for
10 s, 45 cycles of 0 s at 95 c, 5 s at 50 c, 10 s at 72 c,
5 s at 80 c, all with a final mgcl2 concentration of 5 mm.
the following program was used for measuring reverb
mrna: 95 c for 600 s, 45 cycles of 0 s at 95 c, 5 s at
50 c, 10 s at 72 c, 5 s at 81 c. the final concentration
of mgcl2 was 4 mm. melting curves were analyzed with
continuous fluorescence reading. from the standard curve
generated by measurements taken during the exponential
phase of the amplification, the amount of mrna in each
sample was determined. all results were normalized to the
amount of -actin mrna and are expressed as relative
units.
western blots hepg2 cells were cultured in 75 cm2
flasks for 24 h in e/mem containing 5% fcs in the
presence of 10 7 m t3 or without t3 (with only diluted
naoh in e/mem as a control). cells were washed two
times with ice-cold pbs and a whole cell extract was made
by scraping the cells in 1 ml homogenization buﬀer
(0·25 m sucrose, 10 mm hepes, 25 mm kcl, 1 mm
edta, 10% glycerol containing  xxxd3234xxx , spermidine and
complete protease inhibitor (roche molecular biochemicals)). the cells were then disrupted at 6500 r.p.m. for
60 s in a magna lyser (roche molecular biochemicals)
with green beads (ceramic beads, roche molecular
biochemicals). subsequently, 20 µl protein suspension in
loading buﬀer were loaded onto a 10% sds-page gel.

tr1 and tr2 were detected as described by zandiehdoulabi et al. (2003), using monoclonal antibodies.
data analysis diﬀerences between groups were analyzed
with the mann–whitney u test. pearson’s coeﬃcient of
correlation was used for evaluation of the relationship
between the tr1:tr2 ratio and the hnrnp a1:sf2
ratio and for correlations of serum t3, t4 and ft4 with the
tr1:tr2 ratio. spearman’s correlation coeﬃcient was
used to analyze the correlation between il-6 and t3.
results
in the first experiment we tested if the addition of t3 had
an eﬀect on the endogenous tr mrna expression
and/or the alternative splicing process of tr in hepg2
cells. the amount of t3 in the fcs is in the picomolar
range which is well below the kd of the thyroid hormone
receptor and therefore unlikely to cause interference.

confirmed on a western blot. after incubation of hepg2
cells with 10 7 m t3 the tr1:tr2 ratio at the
protein level decreased from 0·98 to 0·61 (fig. 2). the
mrna ratio of the splicing factors hnrnp a1:sf2 did
not diﬀer when t3 was added. there was also no eﬀect of
t3 on reverb mrna expression.

figure 2 (upper panel) western blots were prepared with whole
cell extract of hepg2 cells incubated with or without 10 7 m t3.
blots were then incubated with monoclonal antibodies against
tr1 or tr2. the arrows indicate the specific bands of 46 kda
for tr1 and 58 kda for tr2. (lower panel) the relative light
units of each band are given and the tr1:tr2 ratio is

compared with euthyroid sera whereas hyperthyroid sera
had increased levels of t3 and t4 (table 1). incubation of
hepg2 cells with hyperthyroid sera induced a decrease in
the tr1:tr2 ratio whereas incubation with hypothyroid sera did not have an eﬀect (fig. 3). no diﬀerence
was found in total tr mrna expression between the
three groups. we then analyzed the mrna expression
of reverb and the splicing factors hnrnp a1 and sf2
and found no diﬀerences in expression between the
three groups. furthermore, there was also no correlation
with the tr1:tr2 ratio. the 10-fold increase in
the tr1:tr2 ratio when compared with the first
experiment is caused by the addition of 10% human
serum.
the third experiment was performed to test if the high
concentration of t3 in the serum of hyperthyroid patients
caused the decrease in the tr1:tr2 mrna ratio in
hepg2 cells. we therefore added increasing concentrations of t3 to hypothyroid human serum. after a 24-h
incubation of hepg2 cells with this t3-enriched serum,
the tr1:tr2 ratio decreased significantly (fig. 4).

with sera from hypothyroid, euthyroid and hyperthyroid subjects.

with the fourth experiment we investigated whether
the well-known altered concentration of t3 and t4 in the
serum of patients with nti would have an eﬀect on the
splicing process of the tr pre-mrna in hepg2 cells.
thyroid function tests and il-6 serum levels of nti
patients and controls are presented in table 2. serum il-6
levels were elevated in the nti patients when compared
with healthy controls, but no diﬀerences could be detected
within the nti patient groups. when all patients were
analyzed together, a strong correlation was found between
total serum t3 and serum il-6 (spearman’s correlation
coeﬃcient, r= 0·61, p,0·001). we harvested hepg2
cells after 5, 10 and 24 h of incubation with serum. since
no significant eﬀects on the splicing of tr were seen
after 5 and 10 h (data not shown) we only describe the data
after 24 h of incubation. the tr1:tr2 ratio did not
change between cells incubated with sera from diﬀerent
groups (fig. 5a). no diﬀerences were found between the
diﬀerent groups for any of the measured mrnas with the
exception of increased reverb mrna in nti patients

discussion

figure 4 the tr1:tr2 mrna ratio in hepg2 cells incubated
with sera from hypothyroid subjects, supplemented with
increasing amounts of t3 (10 9 m to 10 7 m). values are
means s.e.m. (n=6). p values were calculated with the
mann–whitney u test.

with a subnormal t3 (group iii; fig. 5b). the mrna
expression of reverb was negatively correlated to the
level of serum t3 (r= 0·39, p,0·05). we did not
find a relationship between the tr1:tr2 ratio and
reverb. interestingly, although no eﬀect of the individual
splicing factors hnrnp a1 and sf2 on the tr1:tr2
ratio was seen, a negative correlation (r= 0·40, p,0·05)
was found between the tr1:tr2 ratio and the ratio of
hnrnp a1:sf2 (fig. 6). no correlation was found
between il-6 and any of the measured mrnas.
whereas a clear negative correlation was found between
serum ft4 levels of hypothyroid, euthyroid and hyperthyroid patients and the eﬀect of these sera on the
tr1:tr2 ratio, this relationship was not observed for
nti sera (fig. 7).

the balance between tr1 and tr2 is important since
they are both transcription factors but have opposite eﬀects
on t3-responsive gene expression (koenig et al. 1989).
studies in mouse strains that lack both tr isoforms or
only tr2, have shown an increased sensitivity to t3
which is mainly attributed to the abrogation of the
constitutive silencing mediated through tr2 (macchia
et al. 2001, salto et al. 2001). although no definite
conclusions about the role of tr2 can be drawn, both
studies underline the fact that the balance in the
tr1:tr2 ratio may play an important role in the
control of growth and homeostasis.
we show here that a high amount of t3 decreases the
endogenous tr1:tr2 ratio in hepg2 cells without
aﬀecting the transcription of the total tr mrna. this
change in the tr1:tr2 mrna ratio due to t3 was
also observed at the protein level. when hepg2 cells were
exposed to sera from hyperthyroid patients we also found
that high thyroid hormone concentrations decreased the
tr1:tr2 mrna ratio. addition of t3 to sera from
hypothyroid patients similarly resulted in a decrease in the
tr1:tr2 ratio. this change in the splicing direction
towards the dominant negative receptor tr2 could
protect the (hepg2) cell against excessive t3-induced
gene expression, despite an extracellular environment
containing high levels of t3.
the mechanism behind this eﬀect of t3 is not clear.
unlike the gene encoding the tr isoforms, the gene
encoding tr does not contain a tre and is therefore probably not under direct thyroid hormone control
(suzuki et al. 1994). indeed, in our studies t3 had no or
only minor eﬀects on transcription of the tr gene,
indicating that the eﬀect of t3 on tr splicing is probably
not regulated at the transcriptional level of the gene.
alternative splicing of tr pre-mrna could be regulated in various ways. one is the choice of the alternative
5 -splice site, which is mediated by various splicing factors
that bind to the alternative splice site but also to adjacent

elements which results in expression of tr1 or tr2.
in the intron of tr2 a splicing enhancer element (se2)
was characterized which stimulates tr2 mrna splicing in vitro. se2 binds sf2 which indicates that the
splicing process might be influenced by binding of specific
splicing proteins to this element (lazar et al. 1989, laudet
et al. 1991, hastings et al. 2001). t3 added at a concentration of 10 9 m increased the hnrnp a1:sf2 ratio in
hepg2 cells, which coincided with an increase in tr2
expression. the tr1:tr2 ratio decreased although
not significantly. this is in agreement with experiments
that show that a predominance of sf2 over hnrnp a1
promotes the use of the proximal 5 -splice site, which in
our case would lead to a high tr1:tr2 ratio. a high
hnrnp a1:sf2 ratio results in the use of the distal
5 -splice sites, leading to a low tr1:tr2 ratio. it is
known that both sf2 and hnrnp a1 can bind to specific
rna sequences and aﬀect the choice of splice site
(mayeda & krainer 1992, sun et al. 1993, caceres et al.
1994). bai et al. (1999) have shown that co-transfection of
sf2 with a calcitonin/calcitonin in gene-related peptide
(cgrp) gene construct promoted the use of the proximal
3 -splice site, resulting in the inclusion of a terminal
calcitonin exon. co-transfection with hnrnp a1 antagonized the eﬀect of sf2 by stimulating the distal splice site.
in our in vitro model only one alternative splice site is
present, which is the distal splice site leading to tr2 that
is chosen over polyadenylation of tr1. the discovery of
the intronic enhancer element, se2, within the final
intron of tr2 mrna supports the idea that these
splicing factors are involved and that the model proposed
for calcitonin would be valid in this case as well (hastings
et al. 2001). however, involvement of other, possibly
tissue-specific splicing factors that play a role in the splicing
process of the tr pre-mrna cannot be ruled out.
regulation of the splicing process by thyroid hormone
could also be mediated via signaling pathways leading to
phosphorylation and subsequent activation of splicing
factors.

phosphorylation of sr proteins by  xxxg475xxx  protein
kinase leads to their release from nuclear speckles and
enhances protein activity (colwill et al. 1996). xiao and
manley (1997) showed that sf2 could only activate
splicing in vitro when its serine residues in the rs domain
are phosphorylated. it is possible that t3 exerts its eﬀect on
splicing by serine phosphorylation of sf2. since several
kinases, such as  xxxg475xxx , srpk1, protein kinase (pk) a
and pkc are all able to phosphorylate sf2, there are
multiple candidates for regulation by t3. serine phosphorylation of tr isoforms has also been described. for
example, tr1 is stabilized by phosphorylation mediated
by map kinases (mapks) via a nongenomic action of t4
www.endocrinology.org

(davis et al. 2000). chen et al. (2003) have shown that
mapks also potentiate tr activity. sf2, however, is not
a substrate for mapk although other splicing factors might
be involved that could be phosphorylated by mapk. jones
et al. (1994) have shown a reduction in t3-induced gene
transcription as a result of reduced tr1 and tr1
activity due to the use of the  xxxg1377xxx 
inhibitor, h7. in contrast to the eﬀects observed on tr
proteins by phosphorylation, no eﬀects of phosphorylation
have been described on tr isoform expression.
another feature that could contribute to regulation of
the tr mrna processing is reverb. this anti-sense
transcript encodes a nuclear receptor belonging to the

same superfamily as the thyroid hormone receptors. only
two natural target genes are known, the rat apolipoprotein
(apo)a-1 gene and the human reverb gene itself
(adelmant et al. 1996, vu-dac et al. 1998). since the
reverb mrna partially overlaps the tr2 mrna, a
possible role in direct regulation of the tr gene expression by reverb has been suggested. transfection of a
minigene expressing both tr and reverb genes, resulted in a twofold increase in the tr1:tr2 ratio as
compared with tr expression without co-expression of
reverb (hastings et al. 2000). a similar increase in the
tr1:tr2 ratio and reverb mrna was found in
adipocytes that were induced to diﬀerentiate in vitro
(chawla & lazar 1993). on the other hand, in a diﬀerentiating b-cell line, no correlation was found between
the tr1:tr2 ratio and reverb but a positive correlation was found between tr1:tr2 ratio and the
reverb:tr2 ratio (hastings et al. 1997). in this case the
authors do in fact show a relation between tr1 and
reverb, since both are divided by tr2. in our study,
we did not find any correlation between reverb and the
tr1:tr2 ratio, suggesting that, at least in this experiment, reverb mrna has no influence on the splicing of
tr pre-mrna. the increased expression of reverb in
hepg2 cells incubated with nti sera could be the result
of low t3 contents in these sera since we also found a
negative correlation between serum t3 and reverb
which is of unknown significance.
the low amount of t3 in nti sera does not seem
to have an eﬀect on the splicing process of tr
pre-mrna. il-6 levels were elevated in serum of all
nti patients and correlated strongly with serum t3,
which is in agreement with previous reports (boelen
et al. 1993, davies et al. 1996). il-6 has been shown to
contribute to the pathogenesis of nti but the
mechanisms have not yet been elucidated (boelen et al.
1996). in our experiment, serum il-6 was not related to
the tr1:tr2 ratio but we cannot rule out the
possibility that il-6, via co-activators or splicing factors,
plays an indirect role in the regulation of the splicing
process. hepg2 cells incubated with nti sera showed a
relationship between a high hnrnp a1:sf2 ratio and a
low tr1:tr2 ratio which is not related to serum
t3. however, this result supports the idea that a certain
balance in the splicing factors hnrnp a1 to sf2 is
involved in the splicing of tr.
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that high amounts
of t3 in the incubation medium of hepg2 cells, either
present in serum or supplemented, lead to a shift in the
splicing direction of the endogenous tr pre-mrna
towards the dominant negative isoform, tr2. this
suggests a model where the change in splicing direction
protects cells against excessive thyroid hormone-regulated
gene expression. in vivo, this might provide a mechanism
to keep tissues relatively euthyroid despite high serum t3
levels.
