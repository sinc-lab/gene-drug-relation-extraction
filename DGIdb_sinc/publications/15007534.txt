a cross-validation study on the relationship
between central  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
and serum perphenazine concentration
received: 11 august 2003 / accepted: 7 january 2004 / published online: 6 march 2004

abstract rationale: there is a need for laboratory
measures to guide clinical treatment with antipsychotic
drugs. for serum concentration of the classical antipsychotic drug perphenzine an optimal therapeutic interval
has been identified between 2 and 6 nmol/l. positron
emission tomography (pet) studies have suggested an
optimal interval in central  xxxg656xxx  occupancy of between 65 and 80%. objectives: the aim of the
present cross-validation study in clinically stable schizophrenic patients was to examine the relationship between
the optimal interval in central  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and
the therapeutic window for serum perphenazine concentration. methods: six patients who had responded to
maintenance treatment with perphenazine  xxxd1821xxx  were
examined with pet and [11c]raclopride during steadystate conditions. blood sampling was carried out for
minimum serum perphenazine concentration and during
the pet examination. results: the serum perphenazine
concentration was between 1.8 and 9 nmol/l and the d2
receptor occupancy varied between 66 and 82%. the
relationship between central receptor occupancy and
serum drug concentration was curvilinear. mild extrapyramidal symptoms were present in the patient with the
highest  xxxg656xxx  occupancy. conclusions: the previously suggested therapeutic window in serum perphenazine concentration is in good agreement with the optimal
interval suggested for central  xxxg656xxx  occupancy.

introduction
the effect of antipsychotic drugs has been postulated to
be mediated by blockade of central dopaminergic receptors (van rossum 1966; carlsson 1978). this hypothesis
has been supported by the finding of a linear relationship
between  xxxg656xxx  affinity in vitro and doses required
for therapeutic efficacy (creese et al. 1976; seeman et al.
1976; peroutka and snyder 1980). further support has
been provided from a series of open studies using positron
emission tomography (pet) and single photon emission
tomography (spect). high  xxxg656xxx  occupancy has
consistently been demonstrated in patients treated with
different classical antipsychotics (farde 1992; farde et al.
1988a; kapur et al. 1999; talbot and laruelle 2002).
open label studies of patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, have repeatedly shown that there is a high
risk of extrapyramidal side effects (eps) at a striatal d2
receptor occupancy exceeding 80% (farde 1992; kapur et
al. 1999; tauscher et al. 2002). the threshold for eps has
more recently been confirmed in two double-blind studies
of patients treated with classical antipsychotics (nordstrm et al. 1993b; kapur et al. 2000a). in both these
studies, a greater likelihood for antipsychotic effect was
reported in patients with  xxxg656xxx  occupancy above
65–70%.
to optimize antipsychotic drug treatment, it is beneficial to find guidelines that can be applied in clinical
monitoring. the use of serum drug concentrations has
been suggested to provide such a tool. however, in most

149

studies, no consistent relationship between serum drug
concentration and antipsychotic effect has been demonstrated (dahl 1986; baldessarini et al. 1988; garver
1989). difficulties in finding such a relationship may be
related to inclusion primarily of patients treated with high
doses and no or few patients with subtherapeutic doses.
one exception is studies of perphenazine, a phenothiazine
widely used in europe. patients treated with low doses
were included and thresholds in serum drug concentration
for antipsychotic effect as well as for eps could indeed be
demonstrated (hansen et al. 1979, 1982; knudsen et al.
1985a, 1985c, 1985d; larsen and hansen 1989). it was
reported that a serum perphenazine concentration below
2 nmol/l usually does not provide sufficient effect,
whereas serum concentration levels above 6 nmol/l do
give expected antipsychotic effect, but are more likely to
elicit eps. an optimal serum concentration level for
treatment with perphenazine  xxxd1821xxx  was accordingly
suggested to range between 2 and 6 nmol/l.
there are thus two lines of research suggesting optimal
intervals for treatment with antipsychotic drugs. the pet
studies indicate that 65–80%  xxxg656xxx  occupancy is
optimal and the serum concentration studies of perphenazine suggest that 2–6 nmol/l is optimal.
the aim of the present cross-validation study was to
test if these two independently generated laboratory measures could be correlated. the relationship between serum
perphenazine concentration and  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
was examined in schizophrenic outpatients on long-term
maintenance treatment with perphenazine  xxxd1821xxx .

materials and methods
the study was performed in accordance with the principles of the
declaration of helsinki and the declaration of hawaii. all subjects
participated after giving full informed consent. the study was
undertaken after approval from the ethics and radiation safety
committees of karolinska hospital as well as from the medical
product agency.

table 1 demographic data and perphenazine doses used, listed as
ml per week and mg per month. the result from ratings of
symptoms according to positive and negative syndrome scale of
schizophrenia (panss), and eps according to simpson and angus
rating scale (sas) and barnes rating scale for drug-induced
akathisia (barnes) are listed with the score obtained at time for

overall study design
six patients treated with perphenazine  xxxd1821xxx  were examined
with pet and the radioligand [11c]raclopride for determination of
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy. in order to be included in the study, the
patients had to be responders to standard treatment and had to be
clinically stable. venous blood samples for serum drug concentrations were drawn at the estimated time for minimum serum
concentration, i.e. on the day before perphenazine injection (cmin)
and on the day for pet (cpet). the pet examination was
performed 7 days after perphenazine injection, which was expected
to be close to the time of maximum serum drug concentration
(tmax). clinical ratings were performed on the day before perphenazine injection and on the pet day. the timepoints for bloodsampling were based on previous studies of the serum concentration
levels during treatment with perphenazine  xxxd1821xxx .
control subjects
the  xxxg656xxx  occupancy was analyzed using age corrected mean
from the [11c]raclopride binding determined in a group of control
subjects. the control group consisted of 25 control subjects, 21 men
and four women, aged 17–49 (mean 31€8). they were all healthy
according to history, physical examination, psychiatric interview,
blood and urine analysis and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of
the brain.
patients and clinical ratings
six patients with schizophrenia according to dsm iv were
recruited from psychiatric outpatient clinics in stockholm (table 1).
four of them were men and two were women. the age range was
28–56 years. they were somatically healthy according to medical
examination as well as blood and urine controls. they were treated
with perphenazine  xxxd1821xxx  ( xxxd2889xxx ; 108 mg/ml) which, like the
more widely used fluphenazine (siqualone), belongs to the chemical class of phenothiazines. the doses and injection intervals are
listed in table 1. the monthly perphenazine dose was 76–216 mg.
there had been no change in dose or injection interval during the
last 3 months. concomitant medication with anticholinergics such
as biperidene or orphenadine was not allowed. benzodiazepines
were allowed, but not on the rating days.
the patients were responders to perphenazine treatment (positive score <22 on the positive and negative syndrome scale of
schizophrenia (panss) and ratings score <4 on the clinical global
impression (cgi) (guy 1976; kay et al. 1987). they had no major
signs or symptoms of eps according to the simpson and angus
rating scale (sas) and the rating scale for drug-induced
akathisia (barnes) (simpson and angus 1970; barnes 1989).
ratings of psychopathology and side-effects were performed at the
estimated time for the minimum serum perphenazine concentration

as well as on the day for the pet examination, i.e. on day 7 after
perphenazine injection.
experimental procedure
the pet examination was performed as previously described in
detail (farde et al. 1988b; talvik et al. 2001). before the pet
examination, a helmet was made for each individual. the helmet
was used with a head fixation system to allow transfer of
positioning from mri to pet (bergstrm et al. 1981). to obtain
anatomical correlates, the patients were examined with the mr
signa advantage system (general electric 1.5 t. a fast spin-echo
sequence was used with a moderately t2-weighted protocol.
the pet system (siemens ecat exact hr) was run in the
3d mode. the resolution in plane is 3.8 mm and the axial resolution
is 4.0 mm full width half maximum (wienhard et al. 1994). the
well established radioligand [11c]raclopride was used for examinations of the  xxxg656xxx  binding (farde et al. 1986).
a saline solution of [11c]raclopride (115–215 mbq, specific
radioactivity 140–1300 ci/mmol) was injected as a bolus during
2 s. the cannula was then immediately flushed with 10 ml saline.
brain radioactivity was measured for 51 min after injection of
[11c]raclopride. the reconstructed data were displayed as 47
horizontal sections with a center-to-center distance of 3.125 mm.
serum drug concentration
to obtain the minimum concentration value (cmin), serum perphenazine concentration was determined on the day before perphenazine injection (knudsen et al. 1985b). in addition, serum
concentration values were measured on the day of the pet
examination (cpet), which was scheduled 7 days after perphenazine injection when the serum concentration was expected to be
close to tmax (knudsen et al. 1985b). for determination of serum
perphenazine concentrations, venous blood was drawn in heparinized glass tubes and centrifuged within 30 min. serum aliquots
were stored at 20c until analysis. the serum perphenazine
concentration was quantified using an accredited liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method (lcms) [which is equal to the
high pressure liquid gas chromatographic method (hplc) (larsson
and forsman 1983)].

statistics
the relationship between serum perphenazine concentration
([fserum]) and percent  xxxg656xxx  occupancy (occupancy %) was
examined using the equation for competitive drug binding to
receptors (farde et al. 1989a; karlsson et al. 1995). the following
hyperbolic equation was used in a non-linear fitting procedure:
occupancy% ¼

occmax ½fserum 
kapp
d þ½fserum 

where kdapp is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant
estimated on the basis of the serum concentration and occmax is the
maximal occupancy that can be induced by the drug. the above
relationship was modified by setting occmax equal to 100%. the
reason for this procedure was that the theoretical upper limit for
occupancy induced by competitive antagonist binding is 100%,
which has also been confirmed for [11c]raclopride binding in vivo
(nyberg et al. 1998).

results
six patients aged 28–56 years participated in the study.
they were all treatment responders with no or minimal
side effects (table 1). the monthly perphenazine dosage
was 76–216 mg. the trough serum perphenzine concentration, as measured the day before injection, was 1.8–
9 nmol/l. the serum concentration, as measured on the
day for the pet examination, i.e. on day 7, was 2.7–
7.5 nmol/l. two concentration values were missing due to

determination of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
the pet examinations were performed at day 7 after perphenazine
injection. regions of interest (roi) were delineated on mr images
for the putamen and the cerebellum and transferred to the
reconstructed pet images. the average regional radioactivity
concentration was then plotted versus time (farde et al. 1989a).
the [11c]raclopride binding potential (bp) was calculated using
the simplified reference tissue model (lammertsma and hume
1996). cerebellum, a region devoid of specific raclopride binding,
was used as a reference region (hall et al. 1994). the  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy in the putamen was defined as the percentage reduction
in bp during drug treatment as compared to the mean bp in a group
of 25 control subjects. the error introduced by using mean bp
values from a group of control subjects instead of individual
baseline data may be estimated to be less than 5% when the
occupancy is higher than 70% (farde et al. 1992). since there is a
well known effect of age on  xxxg656xxx  density (nordstrm et al.
1992; antonini et al. 1993; rinne et al. 1993), the reference
baseline value for each subject was corrected for age, using the
equation for the regression line achieved in the control group
(y=0.0251x+4.3671, r=0.44).

fig. 1 calculated  xxxg656xxx  occupancy in the putamen plotted
against the corresponding serum perphenazine concentration determined in six patients with schizophrenia. two values for maximum
serum concentration values were missing due to laboratory problems. for these patients the maximum value was calculated
(minimum serum concentration value1.4) as previously described
(knudsen et al. 1985a). the saturation hyperbola is indicated in the
plot as well as the previously suggested thresholds for effect and
eps

technical problems at time of laboratory analysis (patients
3 and 6, respectively).
when inspecting the pet images, the striatal radioactivity was low in all patients as compared with the control
subjects, indicating drug induced receptor occupancy. the
calculated central  xxxg656xxx  occupancy in the putamen
was 66–82%. the patient with the highest  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy had the highest score on the sas (table 1).
the relationship between the serum perphenazine concentrations and the  xxxg656xxx  occupancy could be
described by the saturation hyperbola. the curvilinear
relationship as well as previously suggested thresholds for
effect and eps are illustrated in fig. 1.

discussion
the results from the present study indicate a close
agreement between the therapeutic window for serum
perphenazine concentration and the optimal interval in
central  xxxg656xxx  occupancy.
in accordance with the law of mass action, pet studies
have repeatedly demonstrated a curvilinear relationship
between serum drug concentration and central  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy (farde et al. 1986; cambon et al. 1987; smith
et al. 1988; baron et al. 1989; nordstrm et al. 1993b;
kapur et al. 1996, 2000a). such a hyperbolic relationship
was also demonstrated in the present study in an analysis
of the relationship between serum perphenazine concentration and central  xxxg656xxx  occupancy. for many
drugs, a sigmoidal relationship has been described between serum drug concentration and effect (ross 1985;
rowland 1995). a similar relationship can be expected
between receptor occupancy and effect, but according to
previous independent pet studies the threshold model is
probably the most valid description of the occupancy–
effect relationship (farde et al. 1992; nordstrm et al.
1993b; kapur et al. 2000a). it cannot, however, be
excluded that the thresholds represent sigmoidals with a
very steep linear component.
previously, many studies have failed to show a
quantitative relationship between serum or plasma drug
concentration and clinical effects (for references, see dahl
1986; baldessarini et al. 1988; garver 1989). one reason
for this may be that the relationships have been searched
for at treatment with high doses of antipsychotics, where
the occupancy in most patients exceeds the suggested
optimal interval. very few individuals have been included
in treatment with the necessary subtherapeutic doses to
obtain a dose-response relationship. it can be speculated
that one reason for inclusion of patients with high doses
was the dependency of the glc technique for determination of concentrations, which has limited potential to
detect low plasma/serum concentrations. with the introduction of hplc and recently lcms, the sensitivity in
the measurements was greatly improved, thus providing
suitable conditions for studies including low and subtherapeutic doses.

the present study represents an attempt to crossvalidate two independently generated dose-response measures. the sample is small, but previous studies provide a
reliable basis for the relationship between serum pephenazine concentration and effect. in addition, the test-retest
reliability for pet measurement is very high (96–98%;
nordstrm et al. 1992; nyberg et al. 1996). taken
together, the present results may be generalized to treatment with perphenazine. an important issue is whether
the present result may be generalized also to other
antipsychotics. for the more recently developed antipsychotics, risperidone and olanzapine, there are limited data
available on plasma/serum concentration relationships.
to examine these relationships, there is a need for study
designs that proceeds from the optimal interval and
assures that also patients with subtherapeutic doses are
included.
the prototype atypical drug clozapine, which may be
more effective in non-responders and have less propensity
for eps (kane et al. 1988; casey 1989), has significantly
lower striatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy (20–67%) than that
of classical antipsychotics (65–80%) (farde et al. 1989c;
farde and nordstrm 1992; nordstrm et al. 1993a,
1995). good clinical effect, despite low  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy (0–30%), has also been reported for the novel
antipsychotic drug quetiapine (gefvert et al. 1998; kapur
et al. 2000b; gefvert et al. 2001; tauscher et al. 2002).
for the partial  xxxg656xxx  agonist aripiprazole, a recent
pet study reported high  xxxg656xxx  occupancy in spite
of no eps (yokoi et al. 2002). considering the above, it
should be underlined that the thresholds for antipsychotic
effect and eps that are discussed in the present study
applies to treatment with classical antipsychotic drugs,
whereas different receptor occupancy profiles can be
expected for treatment with atypical antipsychotics as
well as for partial agonists.
it has been reported that central  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
in its extremes can vary 2- to 3-fold in relation to plasma
drug concentration (farde et al. 1989b). a major portion
of drug in plasma is bound to plasma proteins. theoretically, only the unbound drug molecule can penetrate the
blood-brain barrier (rowland 1995). a close correlation
between free form and brain levels has indeed been
reported in a pet study (farde et al. 1989b). interindividual differences in plasma protein binding have, however, been reported for antipsychotic drugs and may be
one cause for differences in free concentration (kochweser and sellers 1976a, 1976b). the phenothiazine
perphenazine has high plasma protein binding (zia and
price 1975; verbeeck et al. 1983). individually elevated
plasma protein binding would result in high serum drug
concentrations despite absence of side effects, which
indeed has been reported in previous studies (hansen and
larsen 1977). in the present study, the unexpectedly high
serum concentration in patient 6, who had a central d2
receptor occupancy within the optimal interval and no
signs of eps, may be explained by high plasma protein
binding.

normally, the time for maximum serum concentration
(tmax) occurs on day 7 after drug injection, with a
successive decline until next injection (knudsen et al.
1985b). accordingly, the day before injection would
correspond to the cmin, whereas day 7 after injection
would be close to the tmax. however, for one patient, the
cmin was higher than the cpet. for evaluation of these
values, it must be kept in mind that the time points for
maximum and minimum serum concentrations during
treatment with depot formulations are influenced by many
factors. injection technique, injection place and motor
activity are common factors influencing the rate of
absorption, which may result in altered tmax (beyea and
nicoll 1995).
in conclusion, the therapeutic window for serum
perphenazine concentration was in close agreement with
the optimal interval in central  xxxg656xxx  occupancy. the
present result calls for studies of second generation
antipsychotics, targeting the optimal clinical interval and
including subtherapeutic doses. moreover, the good
correspondence between the optimal intervals may warrant reconsideration of serum drug concentrations as a
tool for clinical monitoring of treatment with classical
antipsychotics.
