maturation-dependent effects of chlorpyrifos and parathion
and their oxygen analogs on acetylcholinesterase and neuronal
and glial markers in aggregating brain cell cultures. monnettschudi, f., zurich, m-g., schilter, b., costa, l. g., and honegger, p. (2000). toxicol. appl. pharmacol. 165, 175–183.
an in vitro model, the aggregating brain cell culture of fetal rat
telencephalon, has been used to study the maturation-dependent
sensitivity of brain cells to two organophosphorus pesticides (ops),
chlorpyrifos and parathion, and to their oxon derivatives. immature (div 5–15) or differentiated (div 25–35) brain cells were
treated continuously for 10 days. acetylcholinesterase (ache)
inhibitory potency for the ops was compared to that of  xxxd2940xxx 
(physostigmine), a reversible ache inhibitor. oxon derivatives
were more potent ache inhibitors than the parent compounds,
and parathion was more potent than chlorpyrifos. no maturationdependent differences for ache inhibition were found for chlorpyrifos and  xxxd2940xxx , whereas for parathion and paraoxon there was
a tendency to be more effective in immature cultures, while the
opposite was true for chlorpyrifos-oxon. toxic effects, assessed by
measuring protein content as an index of general cytotoxicity, and
various enzyme activities as cell-type-specific neuronal and glial
markers (chat and gad, for cholinergic and gabaergic neurons, respectively, and gs and cnp, for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, respectively) were only found at more than 70% of ache
inhibition. immature compared to differentiated cholinergic neurons appeared to be more sensitive to op treatments. the oxon
derivates were found to be more toxic on neurons than the parent
compounds, and chlorpyrifos was more toxic than parathion.
 xxxd2940xxx  was not neurotoxic. these results indicate that inhibition
of ache remains the most sensitive macromolecular target of op
exposure, since toxic effects were found at concentrations in which
ache was inhibited. furthermore, the compound-specific reactions, the differential pattern of toxicity of ops compared to
 xxxd2940xxx , and the higher sensitivity of immature brain cells suggest
that the toxic effects and inhibition of ache are unrelated. © 2000

concern has been raised recently about the safety limits for
pesticides residues in infant food (national research council,
1993; schilter et al. 1996; schilter and huggett, 1988). maturation-dependent toxicity testing must take into account fundamental differences from adults, such as transient periods of
vulnerability and age-related susceptibilities in absorption, metabolism, detoxification, and excretion (national research
council, 1993). pups have been shown to be more sensitive to
acute organophosphorus pesticide (op) exposure than adult
animals (benke and murphy, 1975; pope and chakraborti,
1992; pope et al., 1991; atterberry et al., 1997), but less is
known about the maturation-dependent toxicity of low doses
applied chronically (liu et al.,1999). ops are widely used
insecticides (aspelin, 1997). parathion was the first to be used
and is now largely replaced by chlorpyrifos, which is debated
with respect to its risks, especially during development (dam
et al., 1998, 1999; johnson et al., 1998; whitney et al., 1995;
cosenza and bidanset, 1995; roy et al., 1998). the main
mechanism of action recognized for op is the inhibition of
acetylcholinesterase (ache) (ecobichon, 1991; mileson et al.,
1998). in order to exert this inhibitory effect, the compounds
have to undergo an oxidative desulfuration (amitaı̈ et al.,
1998) and this transformation is brought about by the  xxxg578xxx  system (hedlund et al., 1998),
which is more prevalent in liver than in brain (sultatos et al.,
1984; hedlund et al., 1998). inhibition of ache causes an
accumulation of acetylcholine and sustained cholinergic stimulation. besides its enzymatic role of hydrolyzing acetylcholine, ache may influence morphogenesis by regulating protein–protein interactions during neurite outgrowth and synapse
formation (brimijoin and koenigsberger, 1999; bigbee et al.,
1999; layer and willbold, 1995). acetylcholine also was described as being able to modulate cell movements, cell proliferation, and neurite outgrowth during development (lauder

and schambra, 1999). thus, according to these developmentspecific actions of ache and of acetylcholine, op might
disturb various maturation-dependent processes. moreover,
whether the neurotoxic effects of ops are exclusively linked to
their ability to inhibit ache is still a matter of debate (see
review by pope, 1999). the dna and rna synthesis (johnson
et al., 1998; mehl et al., 1994; whitney et al., 1995; song et
al., 1998) and the  xxxg67xxx  signaling cascade (cosenza
and bidanset, 1995) have been reported to be other potential
targets of op toxicity.
in this study, we used an in vitro system, the aggregating
brain cell cultures of fetal rat telencephalon, to address the
question of the maturation-dependent toxicity of ops and to
analyze the relationship between ache inhibition and neurotoxic effects. this three-dimensional culture system, containing all types of brain cells (i.e., neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia), develops from an immature to a
differentiated stage, with synapses and compact myelin formation (honegger and matthieu, 1990; honegger and monnettschudi, 1996). aggregates treated from day in vitro (div) 5
to 15, a period when glial cells are still proliferating, are in an
immature stage, corresponding to the first 10 days after birth.
the differentiated stage corresponds to div 25 to 35, when
mitotic activity is very low and when abundant mature synapses and myelinated axons are observed (honegger, 1985,
1988). this system has already been used for neurotoxicological studies (honegger and werffeli, 1988; honegger and schilter, 1992, 1995; monnet-tschudi et al., 1993, 1995a; zurich et
al. 1994) and for the detection of the maturation-dependent
neurotoxicity of several metal compounds (monnet-tschudi et
al., 1995b, 1996) and mycotoxins (monnet-tschudi et al.,
1997, 1999), using biochemical and morphological markers of
the different cell types as endpoints. in a first set of experiments, we compared the dose- and time-dependent inhibition
of ache by chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, parathion, paraoxon, and  xxxd2940xxx  (physostigmine) between immature and differentiated cultures. we then examined the general cytotoxic
effects and the cell type-specific effects in immature and in
differentiated cultures and their relationship to the inhibition of
ache.
materials and methods
cell culture. rotation-mediated aggregating cell cultures of fetal rat telencephalon were prepared as previously described in detail (honegger and
monnet-tschudi, 1996). in brief, the pooled forebrains of 16-day fetal rats
(ofa; brl, füllinsdorf, switzerland) were dissociated mechanically using
nylon sieves of 200- and 115-␮m pores. the dissociated and washed cells,
resuspended in serum-free medium, modified dmem (honegger and monnettschudi, 1996), were incubated at a density of 6 ⫻10 7 cells per flask and
maintained under constant gyratory agitation at 37°c in an atmosphere of 10%
co 2 and 90% humidified air. media were replenished at intervals of 3 days
until day 14, and every other day thereafter, by exchanging 5 ml of medium (of
a total of 8 ml) per flask.
treatments. chlorpyrifos (purity 99.6%), chlorpyrifos-oxon (purity 97%),
parathion (purity 99.2%), and paroxon (purity 99%) were purchased from

greyhound chromatography (great britain) and physostigmine sulfate ( xxxd2940xxx  sulfate) was purchased from sigma. stock solutions were prepared in
pure ethanol; the final concentration of ethanol in culture media was 0.05%
(v/v). previous experiments showed that, up to these concentrations, ethanol
did not affect any of the biochemical parameters examined (kucera et al.,
1993). cultures were treated continuously for 10 days, from div 5 to div 15
or from div 25 to div 35. fresh solutions were added every second day at
each medium replenishment. cultures were harvested immediately after the
10-day treatment.
assays. for biochemical analyses, aggregating cell cultures were washed
twice with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in 0.5
ml of 2 mm potassium phosphate containing 1 mm edta (ph 6.8), using
glass– glass homogenizers (bellco). the homogenates were briefly sonicated,
divided into aliquots for the different assays, and stored at ⫺80°c.
activity of acetylcholinesterase (ache;  xxxg38xxx ) was assayed by a
modification of the method of reed et al. (1966) and ehrenpreis et al. (1967),
as described by wilson et al. (1972). [ 3h]acetylcholine iodide was used as
precursor and the portion of  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ) activity was
determined in the presence of 10 ⫺5 m bw284c51 dibromide (wellcome
reagents ltd, wellcome research laboratories, beckenham, great britain).
all values given for acetylcholinesterase thus represent “true” ache activity
(i.e., the total activity minus  xxxg248xxx  activity).
activity of  xxxg440xxx  (chat;  xxxg440xxx ) was determined by
a modification (wilson et al., 1972) of the radioenzymatic method of schrier
and shuster (1967), using acetyl-[1- 14c] xxxd1739xxx  as precursor. the activity
was corrected for the portion of nonspecific activity, determined by the
omission of choline in the assay mixture.
 xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad; ec 4.1.1.15) activity was determined
by a modification (wilson et al., 1972) of the radioenzymatic method of wingo
and awapara (1950) using l-[1- 14c] xxxd2431xxx  as precursor.
 xxxg913xxx  (gs;  xxxg913xxx ) activity was assayed by a modification (patel et al. 1982) of the radioenzymatic method of pishak and phillips
(1979). l-[1- 14c] xxxd2431xxx  was used as precursor, and phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase was used as the atp-regenerating system (patel et al.,
1982).
the activity of 2⬘,3⬘-cyclic nucleotide 3⬘-phosphohydrolase (cnp; ec
3.1.4.37) was measured according to the spectrophotometric method of kurihara and tsukada (1967), using the sodium salt of adenosine-2⬘,3⬘-cyclic
monophosphate as substrate.
protein content was determined by the method of lowry et al. (1951) using
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
data analysis. results are expressed as percentage of untreated control
cultures. they are the mean of three to nine replicate cultures performed in
three independent experiments. results, in percentage of controls, were statistically evaluated for significance by using one-way analysis of variance
(anova) followed by the dunett posttest. for each endpoint, this analysis
(anova/dunett) was performed to compare the five test compounds, independently in immature and in differentiated cultures (*p ⬍ 0.05; **p ⬍ 0.01).

results

inhibition of acetylcholinesterase
aggregating brain cell cultures were treated for 10 days,
either from div 5 to 15 or from div 25 to 35, with a range of
concentrations of chlorpyrifos (10 ⫺8–10 ⫺4 m), chlorpyrifosoxon (10 ⫺10–10 ⫺5 m), parathion (10 ⫺10–10 ⫺4 m), paraoxon
(10 ⫺10–10 ⫺5 m), and  xxxd2940xxx  (10 ⫺10–10 ⫺5 m). activity of ache
was measured at the end of the treatment period, at div 15 or
35, respectively. figure 1 shows the ache inhibition curves
obtained for the different compounds in immature cultures.
the following order of inhibition potency was derived from

these data: paraoxon ⬎ chlorpyrifos-oxon ⬎ parathion ⬎  xxxd2940xxx  ⬎ chlorpyrifos. the comparison of ic50 values (table 1)
showed that both oxon forms were more potent than their
parent compounds. the differences in inhibition potency were
much more pronounced between chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifosoxon than between parathion and paraoxon (table 1). regarding maturation-dependent differences, parathion and paraoxon
had the tendency to be more potent in immature cultures,
whereas the reverse was found for chlorpyrifos-oxon (table 1).
chlorpyrifos and  xxxd2940xxx  showed the same degree of ache
inhibition in immature and in differentiated cultures (table 1).
ache inhibition observed 2 days after treatment initiation
(fig. 2a) was comparable to that found after 10 days of
continued treatment (fig. 2b).
toxic effects
general cytotoxicity. the general cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring protein content at the end of the 10-day
treatment period. in immature cultures, chlorpyrifos-oxon was
more toxic than chlorpyrifos, with a decrease in protein content

cell-type-specific effects
neurons. the effects of the ops on neurons were analyzed
by measuring the activity of chat, a marker for cholinergic
neurons, and gad, a marker for gabaergic neurons. in
immature cultures, chlorpyrifos-oxon was more neurotoxic for

cholinergic neurons than chlorpyrifos, causing a dose-dependent decrease in chat activity from 10 ⫺7 m, whereas chlorpyrifos caused a significant decrease  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m (fig. 4a).
paraoxon was also more toxic on cholinergic neurons than its
parent compound, with a dose-dependent decrease in chat
activity from 10 ⫺7 m, whereas parathion had no effect (fig.
4a).  xxxd2940xxx  had also no effect on chat activity (fig. 4a). in
differentiated cultures, chlorpyrifos-oxon affected cholinergic
neurons more than chlorpyrifos, showing a significant decrease
of chat activity  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺6 m and a drastic decrease  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m
(fig. 4b). paraoxon was more toxic on cholinergic neurons
than parathion, causing a significant decrease in chat activity
 xxxd1891xxx  ⫺6 m and a drastic decrease  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m, whereas parathion
remained without effect on chat activity (fig. 4b).  xxxd2940xxx 
caused a significant increase in chat activity  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺6 m only
in differentiated cultures and no significant change  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m
(fig. 4b). the comparison of immature and differentiated
cultures showed that chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, and paraoxon were more toxic on immature cholinergic neurons.
in immature cultures, effects on gabaergic and on cholinergic neurons were similar. chlorpyrifos-oxon affected
gabaergic neurons more than chlorpyrifos, causing a dosedependent decrease of gad activity from 10 ⫺7 m, whereas
chlorpyrifos induced a decrease  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m (fig. 4c). paraoxon
also was more neurotoxic than parathion, decreasing significantly gad activity  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺6 and 10 ⫺5 m, whereas parathion did
not affect this activity (fig. 4c).  xxxd2940xxx  had no effect on gad
enzyme activity (fig. 4c). in differentiated cultures, chlorpyrifos-oxon was also more neurotoxic than chlorpyrifos, causing
a decrease in gad activity  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺6 m and a total disappearance
of this marker  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m, whereas chlorpyrifos affected gad
activity significantly  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m, showing a higher sensitivity of
gabaergic neurons than of cholinergic neurons after chlorpyrifos treatment (fig. 4d). paraoxon was more toxic on
gabaergic neurons than parathion, decreasing significantly
gad activity  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺6 m and drastically  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m, whereas
parathion did not affect this gabaergic parameter (fig. 4d).
 xxxd2940xxx  had no significant effect on gabaergic neurons (fig.
4d). comparison of the maturation-dependent effects of the
compounds on gabaergic neurons showed that there was no
maturation-dependent difference for chlorpyrifos, whereas
chlorpyrifos-oxon was more toxic on immature gabaergic
neurons. parathion did not affect gabaergic neurons, either in
immature or in differentiated cultures. paraoxon appeared to
affect more differentiated than immature gabaergic neurons.
 xxxd2940xxx  had a slight tendency to increase gad activity exclusively in differentiated cultures.
glial cells. the effects of the ops on glial cells were
assessed by measuring the enzymatic activity of gs, as an
astrocyte marker, and of cnp, as a marker of oligodendrocytes. in immature cultures, chlorpyrifos-oxon was more toxic
on astrocytes than chlorpyrifos, causing a drastic decrease in
gs activity  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m, whereas chlorpyrifos had no effect (fig.

at div 15 and div 35, respectively. values are expressed as percentage of untreated controls. in untreated controls, the following values (equal to 100%) were
found for div 15 and 35, respectively: chat activity: 727 ⫾ 64 and 1427 ⫾ 134 pmol/flask; gad activity: 3324 ⫾ 103 and 8202 ⫾ 700 pmol/flask.

whereas parathion did not affect this astrocyte marker (fig.
5a).  xxxd2940xxx  did not modify gs activity at the tested concentrations (fig. 5a). in differentiated cultures, chlorpyrifos-oxon
was again more toxic than chlorpyrifos, with a striking decrease in gs activity  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m chlorpyrifos-oxon and no
change after chlorpyrifos (fig. 5b). paraoxon was more toxic
than parathion, causing a drastic decrease in gs activity  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5
m, whereas parathion and  xxxd2940xxx  remained without effect at
the tested concentrations (fig. 5b). comparison of the effects
in immature and in differentiated cultures showed that chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, parathion, and  xxxd2940xxx  showed no
development-dependent difference, whereas paraoxon caused
an increase in gs activity in immature cultures and a decrease
at the same concentration in differentiated cultures.
cnp, the marker of oligodendrocytes, was not modified in
immature cultures by any op treatment, except for chlorpyrifos-oxon, that caused a striking decrease  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m (fig. 5c).

in differentiated cultures, the decrease in cnp activity was
significant  xxxd1891xxx  ⫺5 m paraoxon, whereas chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, parathion, and  xxxd2940xxx  had no significant effect
(fig. 5d). comparison of immature and differentiated cultures
showed that chlorpyrifos-oxon had the tendency to be more
toxic on immature oligodendrocytes, whereas paraoxon appeared to be more toxic on differentiated oligodendrocytes.
chlorpyrifos, parathion, and  xxxd2940xxx  had no effect, either on
immature or on differentiated oligodendrocytes.
discussion

the mechanisms underlying the higher sensitivity of young
animals to op toxicity are still not fully understood. since in
the whole animal differences in the maturation of biotransformation mechanisms mainly localized in the liver appear to play
an important role (benke and murphy, 1975; mortensen et al.,
1996; lassiter et al., 1998), aggregating brain cell cultures at

fig. 5.  xxxg913xxx  (gs) activity, as marker of astrocytes, and 2⬘,3⬘-cyclic nucleotide-3⬘-phosphohydrolase (cnp), as marker of oligodendrocytes
were measured in immature (a and c) and in differentiated (b and d) aggregating brain cell cultures, treated continuously for 10 days, and harvested at div
15 and div 35, respectively. values are expressed as percentage of untreated controls. in untreated controls, the following values (equal to 100%) were found
for div 15 and 35, respectively: gs activity: 453,650 ⫾ 7,762 and 611,220 ⫾ 26,258 pmol/flask; cnp activity: 13.33 ⫾ 0.38 and 8.55 ⫾ 0.65 ␮mol/flask.

two different maturation stages were used to analyze the intrinsic maturation-dependent sensitivity of brain cells to
chronic op exposure.
chlorpyrifos and parathion applied directly on brain cells
were able to inhibit ache, suggesting the presence of cytochrome p450 activity in brain cells allowing the transformation
of the parent compound into the oxon form, known as the
ache-inhibiting form (norman and neal, 1976; chambers and
chambers, 1989; soranno and sultatos, 1992; hedlund et al.,
1998). furthemore, mouse neuroblastoma cells were shown to
bioactivate parathion in paraoxon (veronesi and ehrich, 1993).
a cytochrome p450 activity was already present in immature
brain cells.
as expected, the oxon derivatives were more effective than
the parent compounds in inhibiting ache. parathion was a
more potent ache inhibitor than chlorpyrifos. in differentiated
cultures, chlorpyrifos-oxon was also more potent than paraoxon, in agreement with the results of amataı̈ and co-workers

(1998), who described a similar order of potency on the isolated enzyme of adult animals. the difference in ic50 values
was much greater between chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxon
than between parathion and paraoxon. this might be due to
differences in the equilibrium between bioactivation and detoxification pathways, as described recently in liver for the two
compounds (mutch et al. 1999). comparison of ic50s for
ache inhibition in immature and in differentiated cultures
showed that there were no maturation-dependent differences
for chlorpyrifos and  xxxd2940xxx , whereas parathion and paraoxon
tended to be more potent in immature cultures and chlorpyrifos-oxon appeared to be slightly more potent in differentiated
cultures. the sensitivity of isolated brain ache to op inhibition was found not to change during postnatal development
(benke and murphy, 1975; mortensen et al., 1998), and it is
generally proposed that target enzymes sensitivity is not responsable for age-related toxicity (benke and murphy, 1975;
atterberry et al., 1997). however, pope and chakraborti

neuromaturation-dependent effects of organophosphates

(1992) described a higher sensitivity to in vivo exposure to
chlorpyrifos and parathion with regard to ache inhibition in
neonatal rats compared to adult animals. p450 metabolizing
and inactivating enzymes, present in liver, have been suspected
to contribute significantly to the greater sensitivity of juvenile
animals to op toxicity (atterberry et al., 1997). as noted
before, these enzymes are also present in brain cells (norman
and neal, 1975) and may explain the discrepancy about the
maturation-dependent sensitivity of ache, if the activity is
measured on the isolated enzyme or in situ.
toxic effects were found only at high degree of ache
inhibition. a similar observation has been made in vivo by
chen and co-workers (1999). with regard to general cytotoxicity, assessed by a fall in protein content together with a
decrease in all enzyme parameters, observed at high op concentrations, no striking maturation-dependent differences were
observed, except for paraoxon, which appeared to be more
toxic on differentiated cultures. examination of neurotoxic
effects revealed a higher sensitivity of immature cholinergic
neurons compared to their differentiated counterparts after
chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, and paraoxon treatments,
whereas differentiated gabaergic neurons appeared to be
more sensitive only to paraoxon. the decrease in chat and
gad enzymatic activities was irreversible, since no recovery
was observed after a washout period of 11 days (data not
shown). this allows exclusion of a downregulation of enzyme
activities and indicates a specific cell loss. glial cells appeared
to be less sensitive to op treatments than neurons. no generalization can be made about the higher sensitivity of immature
brain cells to ops, as maturation-dependent sensitivity to ops
depends on the op compound and on the cell type considered,
in accord with recent findings by liu et al. (1999).
an important issue that emerges from these results is the
relationship between toxic effects and inhibition of ache. the
fact that the oxon forms were more toxic than their parent
compounds would be in favor of a direct relationship between
neurotoxic effects and ache inhibition. however, the following findings support the conclusion that toxic effects and inhibition of ache are unrelated: (1)  xxxd2940xxx , as a reversible ache
inhibitor, showed a potency similar to ops for ache inhibition, but was clearly less neurotoxic; (2) parathion was a more
potent ache inhibitor than chlorpyrifos, but exerted less neurotoxic effects; (3) immature brain cells showed higher sensitivity to chlorpyrifos, although no maturation-dependent differences for ache inhibition were observed. additional
mechanisms of action of ops may exist. chlorpyrifos has
indeed been shown to affect dna synthesis (whitney et al.,
1995; song et al., 1998; slotkin, 1999) and to disrupt the
cyclase signaling cascade (song et al. 1997). susceptibility to
neurochemical changes, like effects on muscarinic and nicotinic ach receptors (pope and liu, 1997; liu and pope, 1998),
as well as earlier markers of neurotoxicity, like microglial
reaction or gliosis (mccann et al., 1996; monnet-tschudi et
al., 1995a; o’callaghan, 1988, 1991; o’callaghan and miller,

181

1989) may allow for detection of changes that occur at low
ache inhibition and before any cell death. recent results
obtained in our laboratory have shown that subcytotoxic concentrations of parathion caused a gliosis (zurich et al., 2000).
such subtle changes would be especially relevant for evaluating the maturation-dependent effects of low op concentrations,
because their consequences might be revealed much later after
exposure. furthermore, ache, as well as nonspecific cholinesterases, mainly  xxxg248xxx , appeared to play a role
during brain development in the regulation of cell proliferation
and neurite outgrowth (layer, 1991). interference of ops with
these functions may also affect brain development. such effects deserve further studies.
all toxic effects on neuronal and glial markers were found at
op concentrations that exceeded the ic50 values for ache
inhibition. however, the compound-specific patterns of toxicity, the differential effects of ops compared to  xxxd2940xxx , and the
higher sensitivity of immature brain cells appeared to be unrelated to ache inhibition. ops may exert their neurotoxicity
via alternative mechanisms. nevertheless ache inhibition remains the most sensitive macromolecular target of op exposure, since toxic effects were found at op concentrations
causing substantial ache inhibition.
