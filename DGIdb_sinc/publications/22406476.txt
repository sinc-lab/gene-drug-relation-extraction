background & aims: aspirin reduces the incidence
of and mortality from colorectal cancer (crc) by unknown
mechanisms. cancer cells have defects in signaling via the
 xxxg1478xxx  (mtor), which regulates
proliferation. we investigated whether aspirin affects  xxxd81xxx –activated protein kinase (ampk) and
mtor signaling in crc cells. methods: the effects of
aspirin on mtor signaling, the ribosomal protein s6, s6
kinase 1 ( xxxg1989xxx ), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4e binding protein 1 ( xxxg693xxx ) were examined in crc cells
by immunoblotting. phosphorylation of ampk was measured; the effects of loss of ampk␣ on the aspirininduced effects of mtor were determined using small
interfering rna (sirna) in crc cells and in ampk␣1/
␣2⫺/⫺ mouse embryonic fibroblasts. lc3 and ulk1 were
used as markers of autophagy. we analyzed rectal mucosa
samples from patients given 600 mg aspirin, once daily for
1 week. results: aspirin reduced mtor signaling in
crc cells by inhibiting the mtor effectors  xxxg1989xxx  and
 xxxg693xxx . aspirin changed nucleotide ratios and activated
ampk in crc cells. mtor was still inhibited by aspirin
in crc cells after sirna knockdown of ampk␣, indicating ampk-dependent and ampk-independent mechanisms of aspirin-induced inhibition of mtor. aspirin
induced autophagy, a feature of mtor inhibition. aspirin and metformin (an activator of ampk) increased inhibition of mtor and akt, as well as autophagy in crc
cells. rectal mucosal samples from patients given aspirin
had reduced phosphorylation of  xxxg1989xxx  and s6. conclusions: aspirin is an inhibitor of mtor and an activator of ampk, targeting regulators of intracellular
energy homeostasis and metabolism. these could contribute to its protective effects against development
of crc.

ratio is finely balanced. nsaids inhibit cell growth and
induce apoptosis at various disease stages, from initiation
to progression. although evidence that aspirin prevents
cancer is compelling, the underlying molecular mechanism remains enigmatic. numerous molecular targets
have been implicated but the antitumor activity of aspirin
cannot be attributed wholly to a single target. it is likely
that aspirin influences several molecular pathways and
that the nonspecific nature of the effect may be key to
cancer prevention. hence, the complex signaling effects of
aspirin that lead to crc cell death require further elucidation.
signaling via the  xxxg1377xxx  mechanistic
 xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) controls cell survival and
regulation of metabolism.3 mtor is pivotal in assimilating growth factor, nutrient, and signaling stimuli that
regulate protein synthesis and growth.4 mtor forms the
catalytic core of 2 distinct complexes, mtorc1 and
mtorc2, both containing mlst8 and deptor proteins. in addition, mtorc1 consists of raptor and
pras40, whereas mtorc2 includes rictor, msin1, and
protor. mtorc1 integrates growth factor and nutrient
signals to influence protein synthesis, growth, autophagy,
and ribosomal biogenesis. the role of mtorc2 is less
well defined, involving cell survival and cytoskeleton regulation. furthermore, mtorc1 regulates mtorc2
through rictor phosphorylation by s6 kinase 1 ( xxxg1989xxx ),
adding further complexity to mtor regulation.5,6
substantial evidence implicates dysregulated phosphoinositide-3-kinase (pi3k)/mtor signaling in cancer development, including crc. mutations in pi3k signaling

olorectal cancer (crc) is common, with a worldwide
incidence estimated at more than 1 million cases
annually. overall survival is poor, underscoring the rationale for new preventative approaches. aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid), reduces cancer
risk, particularly crc.1,2 primary prevention with aspirin
is not currently recommended because the risk:benefit

cancer biology is strengthened by evidence that negative
regulators of mtor are tumor suppressors. pten, which
down-regulates mtor, is inactivated in 30%– 40% of
crcs.9 unconstrained mtor signaling, via effectors
 xxxg1989xxx  and  xxxg693xxx , promotes tumor growth by enhancing
translation and protein synthesis. activation of the  xxxd81xxx –activated protein kinase (ampk), a
critical cellular energy sensor, leads to mtor suppression. ampk is activated by  xxxg2218xxx  ( xxxg2218xxx ), a
tumor-suppressor gene inactivated by germline mutations
in peutz–jeghers syndrome, a crc susceptibility disorder.10  xxxg2218xxx  tumor-suppressor activity is caused partly by
ampk-mediated inhibition of inappropriate mtor activation.11 indeed, ampk activation by pharmacologic activators 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide  xxxd2246xxx  (aicar) and metformin inhibits growth in several
cancers.12 furthermore, treatment of tumor-prone
pten⫹/⫺ /  xxxg2218xxx  hypomorphic mice with ampk activators including a-769662, metformin, and  xxxd2903xxx  delays tumor onset.13
clinical trials of mtor inhibitors have been disappointing, especially for solid tumors. studies using rapamycin, mainly targeting mtorc1, have highlighted feedback signaling, which counters mtor inhibition by
increasing akt via  xxxg1989xxx / xxxg1198xxx .14  xxxd83xxx 
(atp)-competitive inhibitors targeting both mtorc1
and mtorc2 catalytic sites have been developed, but
some increase akt despite  xxxg1989xxx  inhibition, suggesting
that increased akt signaling as a result of mtorc1 inhibition overwhelms mtorc2 inhibition.15 hence, the latest generation inhibitors specifically target mtorc2 to
avoid feedback caused by mtorc1 inhibition.16 however,
the very specificity of such agents may be problematic,
whereas drugs targeting several components within the
same pathway may circumvent signaling redundancy.17
furthermore, the long-term safety profile of such drugs is
unknown, and so their use for chemoprevention is not
appropriate.18
much available evidence supports ampk/mtor signaling as a chemoprevention target. we hypothesize that
pathway modulation is a mechanism by which aspirin
exerts antitumor effects. here, we investigate the effects of
aspirin on ampk/mtor signaling and provide novel
insight into the mechanism of action of aspirin as a
chemopreventive agent in crc.

ers in respective media supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin were treated at
60%–70% confluence.

immunoblotting
cells were lysed in ice-cold, whole-cell lysis buffer
(buffer details are available in the supplementary materials and methods section). for cytoplasmic and nuclear
extraction, cells were lysed in cytoplasmic lysis buffer,
nuclei pelleted, and lysed in hypotonic buffer (30 minutes). protein was measured by the bradford method
(bio-rad, hemel hempstead, uk). lysates separated on
 xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked in 4% nonfat milk with 0.3% tween20
(sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo). antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with chemiluminescence (amersham, ge healthcare, little chalfont, uk).

ampk activity assay
ampk was immunoprecipitated from 50 ␮g lysate with antibodies against ampk ␣1 and assayed for
phosphotransferase activity toward amara peptide using [␥-32p]atp, as previously described.21

nucleotide measurements
cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs) before addition of 5% perchloric acid to
extract nucleotides and centrifuged to remove debris. an
equal volume of a 1:1 mix of 1,1,2 trichlorotrifluoroethane and trioctylamine was added to supernatant. samples
were vortexed, centrifuged, and the upper aqueous layer
was collected. this organic extraction was repeated twice
before separation by capillary electrophoresis with oncolumn isotachophoretic concentration.22

small interfering rna
two small interfering rna (sirna) corresponding
to bases 238 –256 and 267–285 of human ampk␣1 open
reading frame (ncbi reference sequence:  xxxg1830xxx .5):
5=-ccu caa gcu uuu cag gca utt-3= and 5=-uua
aac ugu acc agg uca utt-3= were co-transfected to
maximize knockdown (ambion, austin, tx). nonspecific
sirna was used as negative control. at 60% confluence
cells were transfected in antibiotic-free mccoy’s 5a medium (10% fetal calf serum). transfection (50 or 100
pmol/ml) was performed using lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) and opti-mem (invitrogen).
fresh medium was added 6 hours after transfection.
transfection medium was removed after 48 hours and
experiments were performed 16 hours later.

immunofluorescence
cells grown to 60%–70% confluence on glass coverslips in 6-well plates were treated with aspirin, metformin, or carrier for 16 hours. after treatment, cells were
washed with pbs, fixed with acetone:methanol (⫺20°c,
10 minutes), and blocked in 10% nonimmune goat serum

with alexa fluor 594 f(ab=)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse
igg (invitrogen). nuclei were stained with 4=,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (dapi).

animal studies
all animal studies were approved by the university
of dundee ethics committee and performed under a uk
home office project license. groups of 4 female c57bl/6j
mice were given aspirin or  xxxd2903xxx  in drinking water
(aspirin, 400 mg/kg;  xxxd2903xxx , 300 mg/kg/day). drugs
were dissolved from powder every day into drinking water,
taking into account mouse body weight and the volume
of water consumed each day. no other water was available, and the volume of water consumed by each mouse
per day was noted and used to calculate the dose of drugs
required. the mice were maintained under standard husbandry conditions and monitored for body weight and
water and food intake (supplementary figure 1). the
aspirin dose was escalated to 100% by day 5 and  xxxd2903xxx  by day 15. at day 21 mice were euthanized and
organs were harvested. all animal experiments were performed in accordance with uk coordinating committee
on cancer research (ukccr) guidelines.23

three patients were treated with 600 mg aspirin
once daily for 7 days. the exclusion criteria were current/
recent ingestion of nsaids or any contraindication to
nsaids. the study had ethical and management approval
(local research ethics committee number 99/5/8 and clinical trial authorisation number 17844/0001/001). after
informed consent, biopsy samples were taken from normal rectal mucosa before, and at 4 hours, 24 hours, and
after 7 days of aspirin treatment.

results
aspirin inhibits mtor signaling and induces
ampk in crc cells
we investigated aspirin’s effects on the mtorc1
target proteins  xxxg1989xxx , its substrate s6 ribosomal protein
(s6), and  xxxg693xxx  in 3 crc cell lines: rko, sw480, and
hct116. these cell lines represent crc as a whole and
differ in their mutation profile with respect to mtor
pathway genes (supplementary table 2).
we used 5 mmol/l aspirin for stimulation having previously observed apoptosis with this concentration in
crc cells.24 there was a striking decrease in  xxxg1989xxx  phosphorylation  xxxd1891xxx  minutes and an overall decrease at 16

gastroenterology vol. 142, no. 7

hours in all crc cell lines after aspirin (figure 1a). aspirin decreased s6 phosphorylation at sites specific to  xxxg1989xxx 
at 8 and 16 hours in all cell lines (figure 1a). decreased
 xxxg1989xxx  phosphorylation  xxxd1891xxx  minutes did not translate
into an immediate decrease in s6 phosphorylation, suggesting the presence of intermediate steps. we examined
aspirin effects on the other well-characterized mtorc1
target  xxxg693xxx . when phosphorylated by mtorc1,  xxxg693xxx  dissociates from  xxxg692xxx  which initiates cap-dependent
translation. hypophosphorylated  xxxg693xxx  binds  xxxg692xxx ,
thereby inhibiting translation. aspirin decreased phosphorylation of  xxxg693xxx  in crc cells (figure 1b). these
results suggest that aspirin exerts an inhibitory effect on
mtorc1 signaling. we confirmed increased expression of
phosphorylated proteins of  xxxg1989xxx , s6, and total  xxxg693xxx  in
crc tissue, compared with matched normal tissue (supplementary figure 2).
we next examined whether aspirin’s inhibitory effects
on mtor signaling were explained by ampk activation.
aspirin increased phosphorylation of ampk at thr172,
which reflects ampk activity,  xxxd1891xxx  minutes in all crc cell
lines (figure 1c). this generally was sustained for 1–2
hours, with a further increase at 16 hours. phosphorylation of acetyl-coa carboxylase (acc), a well-established
ampk substrate, may be a more accurate representation
of ampk enzyme activity. enhanced ampk phosphorylation was paralleled by increased phosphorylation of acc
that was sustained up to 16 hours (figure 1c). we further
confirmed that aspirin stimulates ampk activity by performing quantitative kinase assays, which reflected the
phosphorylation state of ampk and acc (figure 1d). we
confirmed that salicylate (aspirin metabolite) induces
ampk and acc phosphorylation at 1 and 5 hours. there
is evidence of decreased s6 phosphorylation at 8 and 16
hours and decreased  xxxg693xxx  at 16 hours (supplementary
figure 3).
nucleotide fluctuation increases the amp:atp ratio
and activates ampk, therefore we assessed whether
aspirin influences nucleotides in crc. consistent with
previous data,22 basal amp levels were below capillary
electrophoresis detection limits but amp was evident in
aspirin-treated crc cells. in line with previous work,22 we
used the  xxxd80xxx  (adp):atp ratio as a
surrogate for amp:atp variation. if the adp:atp ratio
increases by 5-fold, the amp:atp ratio increases by 25fold, providing the adenylate kinase reaction is in equilibrium.25 there is a 2.8-fold increase in the adp:atp ratio
and a 10-fold increase in the derived amp:atp ratio after
4 hours of aspirin exposure (supplementary table 3). the

is similar to that with mitochondrial and glycolytic 2-deoxyglucose (2-dg) inhibitors.22 taken together with the
effects on ampk and acc phosphorylation and amp
kinase activity, these results definitively show that aspirin
activates ampk in crc cells.

dependency of aspirin-mediated mtor
inhibition on ampk activation
to investigate whether aspirin-induced mtor inhibition is caused by ampk activation, we aimed to abrogate the aspirin-induced ampk response in crc cells
using sirna to silence the ampk␣ catalytic subunits.
given ampk␣1 was the predominant isoform in rko
cells (figure 2a), transfection was performed with 2 sirnas to ampk␣1 that knockdown both ampk and acc.26
although sirna inhibition of ampk␣1 reduced both
ampk and acc phosphorylation in response to aspirin,
this did not attenuate aspirin-induced inhibition of  xxxg1989xxx 
and s6 phosphorylation (figure 2b). however, total
ampk was not completely silenced, raising the possibility
of residual kinase activity. the response to amp is finely
tuned and small increases in amp lead to large changes in
ampk signaling. nonetheless, these findings suggest that
attenuating aspirin-induced ampk activation does not
exert equivalent abrogation of aspirin’s inhibitory effects
on mtor signaling.

to further explore the dependency of aspirin-induced
mtor inhibition on ampk activation, we used ampk
mefs with both catalytic subunits genetically deleted.
notably, the cellular energy status is not affected in
ampk knockout compared with wild-type mefs.27 similar to crc cells, aspirin increased ampk and acc phosphorylation in parental mefs (ampk␣1/␣2⫹/⫹), although
there were no detectable signals in ampk␣1/␣2⫺/⫺ knockout mefs (figure 2c and supplementary figure 4). however, aspirin decreased both  xxxg1989xxx  and s6 phosphorylation
in parental and ampk␣1/␣2⫺/⫺ mefs (figure 2c and supplementary figure 4). together with sirna results, these
findings indicate that aspirin may induce mtor inhibition through both ampk-dependent and ampk-independent mechanisms.

influence of akt on ampk activation and
mtor inhibition and effects on mtorc2
given that akt may affect both ampk and mtor,
we investigated whether akt signaling influences aspirininduced ampk activation and mtor inhibition using
cells with akt1 and 2 deleted (hct116 akt1/2⫺/⫺).19 akt
expression was confirmed (supplementary figure 5). aspirin increased ampk and acc phosphorylation in both
parental and hct116 akt1/2⫺/⫺ cells (figure 3a). indeed,
the effect on ampk/acc is greater in the absence of akt.

aspirin combined with metformin enhances
ampk activation and mtor inhibition
results thus far establish that aspirin acts on
ampk and mtor, both key regulators of cellular energy
and metabolism. we next investigated whether aspirin
combined with a known ampk activator would have an
additive effect on mtor inhibition because aspirin effects
may not saturate the potential ampk response. metformin, a known ampk activator, inhibits akt28 and this
was confirmed in rko cells (figure 4a). aspirin and
metformin combination treatment resulted in greater
ampk activation than either agent alone after 10 minutes, and activation was attenuated only marginally at 16
hours (figure 4b and c). ampk activation was paralleled
by a marked decrease in akt phosphorylation  xxxd1891xxx  minutes, remaining detectable at 16 hours. neither agent
alone decreased s6 phosphorylation, examined as an end
point of mtor signaling,  xxxd1891xxx  minutes, but there was a
substantial decrease with combination treatment, which
was sustained at 16 hours (figure 4b and c). these results
show that the combination of aspirin and metformin has

a striking additive effect on ampk activation and mtor
inhibition.

aspirin induces autophagy in crc cells
having established that aspirin modulates mtor
signaling in crc cells through composite effects on pathway components, we explored resultant cell biological
outcomes. aspirin inhibits cell proliferation and induces
apoptosis.24,29 as expected, aspirin increased cleaved
caspase-3 and reduced  xxxg1681xxx 
(pcna) levels in crc cells (figure 5a and b), consistent
with apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. we also
examined the rna binding protein human antigen r
(hur) given its relevance to crc cell proliferation. hur
cellular localization determines its ability to influence
messenger rna (mrna) stability by binding adenylateuridylate–rich elements of labile mrnas. hur is located
in nuclei of unstimulated cells and mrna-stabilizing
properties rely on cytoplasmic translocation. ampk decreases cytoplasmic hur and binding to target transcripts30 and hur regulates stability of cyclins.31 aspirin
decreased cytoplasmic hur and  xxxg365xxx  in crc cells
(figure 5b). taken together these results confirm that
aspirin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis.
mtor negatively regulates autophagy and therefore we
assessed aspirin’s effects on autophagy. lc3 is a commonly used autophagy marker and its processed form,
lc3-i, resides in cytoplasm. after autophagy induction,
lc3-ii, the conjugated form of lc3, associates with autophagosomes. however, an increase in autophagosomes
alone, suggested by increased lc3-ii, does not necessarily
indicate increased autophagy.32 increases in lc3-ii after
pretreatment with a lysosomal inhibitor, such as  xxxd279xxx  a, signify a true increase in autophagic flux. aspirin
increased lc3-ii in hct116 cells, which is increased fur-

we next examined whether akt influenced aspirin-mediated effects on mtor signaling. although there was less
phosphorylated  xxxg1989xxx  in untreated hct116 akt1/2⫺/⫺
cells compared with parental cells, aspirin decreased  xxxg1989xxx 
and s6 phosphorylation in both cell lines  xxxd1891xxx  minutes
and 16 hours (figure 3a). these results indicate that
aspirin-induced ampk activation and mtor inhibition are not secondary to akt signaling. phosphorylation
of the sgk1 substrate, ndrg1, is a robust marker of
mtorc2. aspirin decreased ndrg1 phosphorylation in
rko cells but not in hct116 cells (figure 3b). further
experimentation is required to establish whether the effects of aspirin on mtorc2 are cell-type specific.

pirin also induces autophagy in hct116 akt1/2⫺/⫺ cells
(figure 5f). these results show that aspirin induces autophagy in crc cells, likely through both direct ampkmediated ulk1 phosphorylation and by inhibiting
mtor signaling.

aspirin affects ampk and mtor signaling
in vivo
we performed a short-term experiment over 21
days in control mice to investigate whether aspirin induces ampk activation in vivo. we found evidence of
both ampk and acc phosphorylation in livers of aspirintreated mice (figure 6ai). aspirin increased ampk phosphorylation in the colon of treated mice. increased acc
phosphorylation was detectable in 3 of 4 mouse colons.
we also undertook a short-term biological-response
study in normal rectal mucosa of patients treated with
aspirin. s6 was the most robust marker of mtor inhibition with some variation in basal levels in untreated patients (figure 6bi). three patients were given 600 mg
aspirin orally once daily for 7 days. normal rectal mucosa
was biopsied before treatment and at 4 hours, 24 hours,
and 7 days. we found that aspirin decreases s6 phosphorylation in normal rectal mucosa (figure 6bii) and there is
some decrease in phosphorylation of  xxxg1989xxx  (figure 6biii).
these results suggest that aspirin when ingested orally
can modulate effectors of mtor in vivo.

ther with  xxxd279xxx  a pretreatment, suggesting induction of autophagy (figure 5c). immunofluorescence confirmed increased lc3 detection after aspirin alone and in
combination with metformin (figure 5d). ampk phosphorylates ulk1, the mammalian homologue of atg1,
which initiates autophagy.33,34 we found that aspirin induces ulk1 phosphorylation at ser555 in rko cells
(figure 5e). aspirin-induced ulk1 phosphorylation was
abrogated in ampk␣1/␣2⫺/⫺ mefs, indicating ampk dependency (figure 5e). aspirin decreases phosphorylation
of ulk at serine 757, suggesting inhibition of mtor also
may contribute to autophagy induction in crc cells (figure 5e). however, aspirin induced autophagy, evidenced
by increased lc3, in ampk␣1/␣2⫺/⫺ mefs, indicating an
ampk-independent contribution (figure 5f). notably, as-

here, we show that aspirin inhibits mtor signaling in crc cells, as evidenced by inhibition of phosphorylation of  xxxg1989xxx ,  xxxg693xxx , and s6. we show that aspirin
activates ampk in crc cells. furthermore, we show that
aspirin induces autophagy in crc cells, a response characteristic of mtor inhibition. our results support the
concept that aspirin affects multiple components of the
ampk/mtor signaling pathway.
mtorc1 plays a key role in protein synthesis regulation via its effectors  xxxg1989xxx  and  xxxg693xxx . constitutively
activated mtor signaling has been shown previously in
crc. indeed, several ribosomal proteins are up-regulated
in crc, including the  xxxg1989xxx  target s6.35 targeted mtor
inhibition decreases adenoma formation in a mouse familial adenomatous polyposis model36 and also inhibits
crc cell growth. our results show (to our knowledge, for
the first time), in crc cells, that aspirin inhibits the
downstream effectors of mtorc1:  xxxg1989xxx ,  xxxg693xxx , and s6.
these results are consistent with microarray data showing
that aspirin induces the greatest changes in ribosome
biogenesis genes.37  xxxg1989xxx  deletion in mice results in defective ribosomal biogenesis and disruption of a single ribosomal protein shuts down ribosomal synthesis.38 given
the striking decrease in  xxxg1989xxx , it will be important to
evaluate whether aspirin affects ribosomal synthesis both
in normal colon and in crcs from both chemopreventive
and adjuvant perspectives.

autophagy, protein translation, and ribosome biogenesis.

ception that ampk has a tumor-suppressor role.12 furthermore, phosphorylated ampk expression has been
shown to be associated with improved survival in a subset
of crcs.42
our data from sirna experiments in crc cells and
ampk mefs indicate that aspirin-induced ampk activation
is not the sole determinant of observed mtor inhibition.
although the effects of aspirin on ampk/mtor signaling
in mefs may not be representative of all somatic mutations
arising in human crcs, these experiments provide a model
for so called normal cells representing normal colonic epithelium, which is relevant to chemoprevention. our data are
consistent with mtor effects being ampk-independent but
we cannot exclude an ampk-dependent contribution.
recently, it was shown that ampk is not required for
mtorc1 inhibition after glycolytic blockage by energydepleting agents (2dg) or known ampk activators.27 an
alternative mechanism of mtorc1 inhibition via rag
guanosine triphosphatase inhibition is suggested. indeed,
aspirin may mediate mtorc1 inhibition via similar effects on rag function. combination treatment with
2-dg and metformin led to apoptosis in prostate cancer
cells via atp depletion and ampk activation.43 similarly,
aspirin may induce changes in atp with ensuing alterations in amp:atp ratios, and/or inhibition of the mito-

chondrial chain complex. both aspirin and salicylate have
been shown to uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. the results presented here show that aspirin
increases the adp:atp ratio, an established surrogate for
the amp:atp ratio. it is clear that the upstream mechanisms underlying aspirin-induced ampk activation merit
further investigation.
we have shown that aspirin activates ampk and inhibits mtor signaling in crc cells. the key question is
where the balance lies in terms of mtor inhibition and
cellular response to aspirin. here, we show in crc cells
that aspirin induces a cellular phenotype characteristic of
mtor inhibition, namely autophagy. during autophagy
lysosomes digest their own cytoplasmic organelles to generate energy.44 substantial evidence indicates that ampk/
mtor signaling regulates autophagy.45 some previous reports have suggested that some nsaids induce
autophagy.46,47 we show that aspirin does induce autophagy, likely through ampk phosphorylation of ulk1
and also an ampk-independent mechanism of mtor inhibition. that aspirin induces autophagy in ampk␣1/␣2⫺/⫺
mefs strengthens the probability of ampk-independent
input. concerns with mtor inhibition are the potential for
feedback-initiated akt activation. our results suggest that
the predominant aspirin-induced cellular response is one of
mtor inhibition (autophagy) rather than akt activation
(cellular proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis). signaling
between mtor and akt appears to exist in balance and
inter-regulatory pathways likely have evolved to restrain hyperactivation of both.48 indeed, we show the added value, in
terms of both mtor and akt inhibition, of combining
aspirin with metformin.
combination treatment is a particularly attractive strategy to combat the metabolic syndrome, characterized by
hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. there is a strong association
between the metabolic syndrome and colorectal neoplasia.49 furthermore, metabolic syndrome may adversely
affect the propensity of crc to metastasize and relapse,
impacting survival.50 considerable evidence indicates that
physical inactivity is associated with increased cancer
risk.51 because exercise activates ampk, we speculate that
ampk and mtor may be linked mechanistically to the
cancer-protection effects of exercise. indeed, the absence
of  xxxg1989xxx  protects mice from both age- and diet-related
obesity and enhances insulin sensitivity.52 as master regulators of cellular energy and insulin signaling, both
ampk and mtor highlight the association between the
metabolic syndrome and crc, and present ideal targets
for intervention.
a small-molecule approach directed at a single target to
effect cancer cure remains elusive, and may even activate
signaling detrimentally through normally redundant
pathways. it is recognized that mutations in genes encoding pi3k/mtor and ras pathways in crc cell lines
influence response and combined inhibition is required to
inactivate mtor.53 thus, development of several agents,
each targeting different signaling switches, may have

greater efficacy with reduced side effects. we have shown
that aspirin targets the ampk/mtor signaling pathway
at several levels in crc cells, thus gaining new understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the
antitumor activity of aspirin (figure 7). furthermore, we
have shown that metformin may be used in a concerted
manner to inhibit the mtor pathway in crc.
