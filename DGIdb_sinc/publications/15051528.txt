abstract
exposure of goldfish to the cold (5 jc) caused a sharp increase in brain putrescine level during the first week. such increase continued at
a minor rate for the whole period of exposure (2 months). in contrast, the content of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  remained unchanged.
putrescine increase was concomitant with a remarkable rise in  xxxg1626xxx  activity (odc), which reached a maximum
stimulation after 1 week of cold exposure, and declined thereafter, remaining significantly higher than the control for the entire period of
study. cold exposure caused also a reduction of  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg152xxx ) activity and an increase of ornithine
level, whereas methionine content was unchanged. when fish exposed to cold temperature were returned to 20 jc, the modifications
observed on brain polyamine metabolism were completely reversed. supported by previous observations, our results suggest that the changes
in the polyamine metabolism induced in goldfish brain by cold exposure could represent an homeostatic mechanism carried out by the
goldfish to minimize the possible effects of thermal changes.

1. introduction
polyamines are positively charged molecules, mainly
composed of putrescine, spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx , that
represent a group of naturally occurring compounds exerting a bewildering number of biological effects. even though
considerable progress has been made during the last years in
our understanding of their physiological function, many
questions remain unanswered. polyamines are ubiquitously
found in all living cells and from mammals to invertebrates,
they have critical functions in supporting cell growth and
differentiation [3,11,20,25,52]. polyamines are also implicated in normal growth and differentiation of cns [51], and
recent studies suggest they might influence neuronal
growth, migration, and synaptic plasticity by modulating
nmda receptors [21]. specific membrane binding sites
have been shown [13] through which polyamines regulate
cell signaling. they have indeed been reported to modulate
the activity of g-proteins, protein kinase c and phopholi* corresponding author. tel.: +39-51-2094135; fax: +39-51-251208.

pases [4,10,46], to regulate ionic fluxes and neural ion
channels [45], to control the ca2 + homeostasis [47], and
to prevent lipid peroxidation [33]. polyamines modulate the
nmda receptor-complex and its associated second messenger pathways [41,55], and putrescine seems to be involved in stimulating neurotransmitter release from fish
brain [23].
polyamine synthesis is regulated by two major inducible
enzymes, l- xxxg1626xxx  (odc) and  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg152xxx ) [29]. odc catalyzes the decarboxylation of ornithine to form putrescine,
while  xxxg152xxx  catalyzes the decarboxylation of  xxxd3156xxx , providing the aminopropyl groups necessary
for the formation of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  from putrescine. the intracellular concentration of these polycations is
controlled by degradation pathways;  xxxd3234xxx  and spermidine can be converted back to spermidine and putrescine,
respectively, through the combined action of spermidine/
 xxxd3234xxx  n1-acetyltransferase (ssat) and polyamine oxidase (pao) [2,50]. the biosynthetic pathways of the polyamines appear the same both in mammals and fish [53],
although polyamine distribution and enzyme activities can

242

be different [5,49] and polyamine levels of fish appear
significantly higher compared to those of mammals. in adult
mammalian brain, polyamine synthesis can be greatly stimulated in response to stressful stimuli and electrical stimulation [6,34] with persistent elevation in putrescine, which
may last for several days [37], despite the fact that the
increase in odc activity is transient and subsides within 24
h after the insult [9]. the putrescine increase appears to be
related to the intensity of the stressor and can result in
persistent accumulation of the compound and eventual
reduction in the concentration of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx 
[14]. a significant increase in odc activity and putrescine
content, along with a decrease in  xxxg152xxx  activity—
which provokes an impairment of the efficient conversion of
putrescine into spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx —has been shown
after traumatic brain injury or in the ischemic rat brain
[18,43]. it was suggested that a persistent stress-induced
accumulation of putrescine may be harmful by itself, without the concomitant increase in spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx 
[38]. however, the prevalent opinion is that the induction of
polyamine metabolism after brain insult is an integral part of
a protective biochemical program. several of the described
polyamine functions may indeed assume importance in
cellular defence. increases in polyamine levels or odc
activity have recently been reported in the liver of the
goldfish as response to variations of the diet, salinity,
temperature, season and heavy metal [7,8]. we have also
shown an increase of putrescine level and, at the same time,
a remarkable rise in odc activity in heart, liver, muscle and
brain of goldfish exposed to cold for a week, not correlated
with starvation [32]. in contrast, the content of spermidine
and  xxxd3234xxx  was unchanged. in agreement with the
hypothesises of a protective role of polyamines after mammalian brain insults, the increase in polyamine metabolism
found in goldfish tissues has been considered to be part of
the metabolic processes which favour the adaptation of fish
to environmental modifications [32].
since goldfish is a teleost that inhabits small, shallow
ponds in many countries and is exposed to large seasonal
fluctuations in temperature, the purpose of this study here
described has been to analyse the time-related variations of
polyamine metabolism in brain of goldfish exposed to cold
temperature (5 jc) for a period of 2 months. in addition, to
verify if cold-induced modifications in polyamine metabolism represent an adaptive response to the environmental
stimulus, the effect of returning the fish to 20 jc after 1
week of cold exposure has been evaluated.

c] ornithine (sp. act. 40 – 60 mci/mmol) was
supplied by du pont nen (boston) and s-adenosyl-l[carboxyl-14c] methionine (sp. act. 56 mci/mmol) was

supplied by amersham. all other chemicals were from
sigma (st. louis, mo).
2.2. experimental animals
freshwater goldfish carassius auratus (10 – 12 cm in
length; mass approx. 35 g), obtained from a local breeder,
were maintained at 20 jc in thermostated-glass aquaria
filled with unchlorinated well water constantly aerated and
filtered through activated charcoal filters. all fish were fed
once daily with a commercial fish pellet and kept under a 12
h/12 h light– dark photoperiod. after 10 days, a group of
fish was transferred to a different aquarium, which was then
located in a cold room; the temperature reached 5 jc within
10– 12 h and fish were maintained for 2 months. animals
were killed by decapitation and brains were quickly removed and held at 80 jc in a deep freezer until analysis.
the experiments reported here were performed according to
the italian law on protection of laboratory animals, with the
approval of a local bioethical committee and under the
supervision of a veterinary commission for control of animal
care and comfort.
2.3. measurement of polyamine concentration
for polyamine assay, the brain was sonicated in 0.1 n
perchloric acid (pca) and centrifuged for 15 min at
15,000  g. the pellet was dissolved in 0.5 n naoh
containing 0.2% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  (sds) for protein
assay, while aliquots of the supernatant were subjected to
fluorimetric detection after o-phthaldialdehyde derivatization and high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) separation, which followed a previously described procedure
[37].
2.4. measurement of amino acid concentration
aliquots of supernatants obtained after pca extraction
and centrifugation (see above) were lyophilized and resuspended in 0.2 ml of borate buffer (ph 9.5), and amino acid
levels were determined by hplc [19].
2.5. determination of  xxxg1626xxx  activity
for odc assay, the brain was homogenized in ice-cold
50 mm tris – hcl (ph 7.5) containing 0.1 mm edta, 5
mm dithiothreitol, and 0.04 mm pyridoxal-5-phosphate.
after centrifugation at 20,000  g for 20 min, aliquots of
the supernatant were assayed, at 22 jc, essentially according to a previously described procedure [1], by measuring
the 14co2 released from [14c] ornithine (0.2 mm final
concentration) and trapped by hyamine hydroxide. blanks
containing the odc competitive inhibitor alpha-difluoromethyl-ornithine ( xxxd1972xxx ) (2 mm) were run in parallel. the
final results were expressed as nanomoles of co2 evolved
per hour per gram of supernatant proteins.

2.6. determination of  xxxg152xxx  activity
 xxxg152xxx  activity was determined in postmitochondrial
supernatant of goldfish brain homogenates by measuring the
rate of decarboxylation of s-adenosyl-l-[carboxyl-14c] methionine over 1-h incubation period. activity was quantified
in whole brain of fish exposed to different temperatures, and
data are expressed as picomoles of co2 produced per hour
per milligram of protein (mean f s.e.m.). the assay was
performed as previously reported [18].

variance (anova) followed by dunnett’s test for comparison of several experimental groups with single controls.

3. results
the exposure of goldfish at 5 jc for 2 months caused an
increase of putrescine levels in goldfish brain. as shown in
fig. 1, the putrescine levels increased significantly by about
60% after 4 days and continued to increase, at a minor rate,
during the entire period of cold exposure. in contrast, during
the whole period, no statistically significant changes in brain
spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  contents were observed. when the
fish exposed to cold for a week were returned to 20 jc,
putrescine levels reverted to the control values within 4
days. as shown in fig. 2, cold exposure increased the brain
content of ornithine, the immediate precursor of putrescine.
differently from putrescine, the increased ornithine level
declined towards the control values within 2 weeks. in
contrast, the content of methionine, considered to be a
limiting factor for the synthesis of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx ,
remained unchanged. when the fish exposed to 5 jc for a
week were returned to 20 jc, the ornithine level reverted to
the basal values within 2 days.
the low temperature strongly enhanced the odc activity, which increased about 10-fold after 4 days (fig. 3).
during the second week, the odc activity declined, even
though it remained significantly higher as compared to the
control values for the entire period of the cold exposure.
differently, the  xxxg152xxx  activity significantly decreased

to about 50% of controls within the first week (fig. 4). the
reduced  xxxg152xxx  activity was partially recovered after 2
weeks at 5 jc. after 15 days, the  xxxg152xxx  activity
became significantly higher as compared to that measured
at the 7th day, and it slowly raised during the residual period
of cold exposure. however, the levels reached after 2
months remained significantly lower than the control levels.
when the fish were returned to 20 jc, both the odc and
 xxxg152xxx  activity reverted to the control values within
few days.

4. discussion
the present results show that the low temperature
exposure of adult goldfish for 2 months affects brain
metabolism of the different polyamines in a different
way. in particular, putrescine levels were increased, while
no significant modifications of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx 
contents were observed. the putrescine accumulation
showed different rates, and the concomitant changes occurring at the substrate and enzyme activity level could
partially justify these features. the transient rise of the
ornithine content and odc activity along with the decrease
in  xxxg152xxx  activity may contribute to induce a putrescine rise, which becomes faster as more substrate is
available and higher odc activity is induced. in fact, a
close relationship between the levels of ornithine and the
contents of polyamines was shown [48] and previous
research has demonstrated that in the brain of goldfish
exposed to cold for 1 week, the transient increase of
putrescine is related to an induction of the odc activity
[32]. a slight delay occurs between the significant increase
in the ornithine and putrescine levels after the cold exposure (2 vs. 4 days). we can hypothesize that, since odc
uses ornithine as substrate to produce putrescine, a certain
increase of the substrate is needed to stimulate the enzyme.
however, we also can observe that we did not sampled the
brain at day 3, and that possibly the delay is shorter than 2
days. we could notice that a significant increase in putrescine levels and odc activity is reached after 3– 4 days of
fish exposure to cold, while it takes place within minutes in
the mammalian brain [24]. we have to observe, however,
that the methodologies used in the two approaches are
rather different, since a direct application to the brain of
metal probes precooled in liquid nitrogen was carried out
for the rats, while the whole fish have presently been
exposed to a gradual reduction of the water temperature.
the reduction in  xxxg152xxx  activity clearly observed in
the brain of goldfish exposed to cold is consistent with the
previous reports on brain traumatic injury and ischemia
in rodents [18,36], where an increase in odc activity
and putrescine content was coupled with a decrease in
 xxxg152xxx  activity.
the decrease in  xxxg152xxx  activity does not modify the
spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  levels as it was expected since the

s. notari et al. / brain research 1006 (2004) 241–247

content of methionine, the limiting factor for the synthesis
of the two polyamines, remained stable. this observation
agrees with previous research showing that a 7-day cold
exposure of goldfish did not change spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  brain content [32]. however, the unmodified levels of
the two polyamines contrast with other results obtained in
rat brain, where acclimation to cold caused a transient
decrease in spermidine [54].
the slow long-lasting increase in putrescine could depend on the decrease of odc activity observed after 7 –
8 days of cold exposure and the drop of substrate availability, which may slow down the putrescine synthesis.
however, the sequestration of putrescine in an isolated
cellular compartment, and its possible unavailability for
degradative enzymes have been reported [14], which might
also explain its long-term accumulation. alternative metabolic pathways for putrescine synthesis could contribute to
its long-lasting accumulation. the ssat, enzyme which reconverts  xxxd3234xxx  and spermidine into putrescine, is rapidly
induced in the mammalian brain by stressful stimuli
[12,39,42]. this may favour the increased  xxxd3234xxx  and
spermidine degradation, contributing to the long-lasting
increase in putrescine with a transient reduction in  xxxd3234xxx 
and spermidine, as observed after trauma [38]. our data do
not exclude the possibility that long-lasting cold exposure
causes a modification of this enzyme in fish, since specific
experiments were not performed. however, the lack of
variations of spermidine,  xxxd3234xxx  and methionine levels
supports the notion that ssat pathway is not involved in
the putrescine accumulation presently observed.
all the changes observed were reversible, and a recover
to basal levels was shown for putrescine, ornithine, odc,
and  xxxg152xxx  after returning the fish at 20 jc. in our
opinion, such a reversibility is a clear evidence that we are
dealing with an adaptive responses to cold, although
further experiments to study the possible consequences of
the cold-induced changes after polyamine metabolism
inhibition are needed. a previous work [40] demonstrated
that changes in polyamine metabolism take place in brain,
liver, heart, and muscle of goldfish exposed to cold, but
their reversibility was not measured. however, due to the
similarity of the response of the different tissues to the
cold, we can presume that the polyamine metabolism in
fish returned from 5 to 20 jc undergoes similar modifications in liver, heart and muscle as it does in brain. we
can observe that the rates of recovery at 20 jc are
generally higher than the initial rise or decrease, as is
particularly evident for the odc activity. our experimental
protocols were not specifically addressed to evidentiate
inactivating/degradative mechanisms after the switch from
5 to 20 jc, or synthesis of new enzyme molecules during
the initial phase of cold exposure, so at the moment, we
are not able to give exhaustive interpretation of the
phenomena. a comparison between reversibility of polyamine metabolism modifications induced by cold in fish
and mammalian brain would be rather interesting. unfor-

245

tunately, due to the methodologies used in rodent studies
[18,24], the brains were irreversibly damaged, and to our
knowledge, recovery experiments have not been performed
in mammals.
changes in polyamine biosynthesis are among the first
metabolic events detectable in mammalian biological systems under the action of a number of stressors [14,17]. their
role is controversial, as the increase in polyamine has been
involved in neurodegenerative processes [22,35]; however,
several reports consider the induction of polyamine metabolism in the nervous system an adaptive response to several
stimuli [14,15,27]. studies with transgenic mice overexpressing the odc gene have demonstrated that the chronic
elevations of brain odc activity together with putrescine
levels, in the absence of an increased  xxxg152xxx  activity or
elevated spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  levels, reflect an endogenous adaptation of neural cells to a noxious stimulus [28].
previous studies have shown that exposure of goldfish at 5
jc for 5 weeks did not modify the energy charge in the
cerebellum [40]. in the same study, behavioural changes
such as hypoactivity at 5 jc and hyperactivity at 35 jc
were observed during thermal acclimation, and the concurrent modifications in various neurochemical parameters
shown at 5 and 35 jc have been considered as homeostatic
mechanisms actively carried out by the animal to adjust
itself to the thermal changes [40]. in agreement, we hypothesize that the lack of changes in spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx 
contents along with the accumulation of putrescine observed
in the brain of goldfish exposed to 5 jc for 2 months are
correlated with their adaptation to the different environment.
this hypothesis is supported by the observation that all the
variations of polyamine metabolism observed in brain of
cold-exposed goldfish were completely reversible when the
fish were returned to 20 jc.
several reports address to the compensatory mechanisms
operating mainly at cellular and subcellular level in goldfish
exposed to temperature changes [29 –31,40]. moreover, in
epidermal cells of teleost fish, the cold exposure has been
shown to cause dissociation of the intermediate filaments
which is readily reversed upon rewarming [44]. this evidence is rather interesting and related to our hypothesis,
since putrescine seems involved in promoting microtubule
assembly in the early stages of tissue regeneration in
mammals [16]. therefore, future studies on fish adaptation
to the environmental challenges will be undertaken, aimed
at correlating the reversible changes in polyamines metabolism presently observed with structural aspects of cell
physiology.
