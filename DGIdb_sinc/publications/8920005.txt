abstract
we have cloned and expressed in escherichia coli a 702-base pair gene coding for the dihydrofolate
reductase
(dhfr) domain of the bifunctional
dihydrofolate
reductase-thymidylate
synthase (dhfr-ts)
from trypanosomu
cruzi. the dhfr domain was purified to homogeneity
by methotrexate-sepharose
chromatography
followed by an
anion-exchange
chromatography
step in a mono q column, and displayed a single 27-kda band on sds-page.
gel
filtration showed that the catalytic domain was expressed as a monomer.
kinetic parameters
were similar to those
reported for the wild-type bifunctional enzyme with k, values of 0.75 pm for dihydrofolate
and 16 pm for nadph
and a k,,, value of 16.5 s-‘.
t. cruzi dhfr is poorly inhibited by trimethoprim
and pyrimethamine
and the
inhibition constants were always lower for the bifunctional
enzyme. the binding of methotrexate
was characteristic
of a class of inhibitors that form an initial complex which isomerizes slowly to a tighter complex and are referred to
as ‘slow, tight-binding’
inhibitors.
while the slow-binding
step of inhibition
was apparently
unaffected
in the
individually expressed dhfr domain, the overall inhibition constant was two-fold higher as a consequence
of the
superior inhibition constant value obtained for the initial inhibitory complex.

while dhfr is responsible for the subsequent
step of regeneration of tetrahydrofolate
from
h,folate which is necessary for the synthesis of
 xxxd3365xxx . in most organisms, dhfr and ts exist
as separate monofunctional enzymes [1,2]. ts is
usually a homodimer protein of 60-70 kda while
dhfr is an 18-25 kda monomer. in contrast, in
protozoa, both enzymes are on the same polypeptide chain, with the dhfr domain at the amino
terminus and the ts domain at the carboxy terminus. the native bifunctional enzyme is a dimer of
two of such subunits with a molecular weight
ranging between 110 and 140 kda [3-51. there is
evidence indicating functional interactions between the individual domains of the dhfr-ts
dimer, presumably communicated
via protein
conformational changes. for example, binding of
mtx to one dhfr domain prevents binding to
the other and substrate channeling of h,folate
from the active site of ts to that of dhfr has
been demonstrated [6]. an x-ray structure for the
leishmania major bifunctional protein showed a
highly positive electrostatic
potential surface
around and between both folate binding sites that
could explain this phenomenon in terms of electrostatic channeling [7].
ts and dhfr are targets for chemotherapy, as
inhibition of either enzyme disrupts the  xxxd3365xxx 
cycle and results in the death of cells. dhfr has
been successfully used as a drug target since it has
diverged greatly through evolution and dhfrs
from different sources can show dramatic differences in their inhibition by folate analogues. the
most extensively studied and successful dhfr
inhibitors are analogues of 2,4_diaminopyrimidines, which include trimethoprim
(tmp) and
pyrimethamine (pyr), and analogues of 2,4-diaminopteridine
such as methotrexate
(mtx).
both tmp and pyr are paradigms of selective
enzyme inhibitors and, alone or in combination
with sulfa drugs, have been employed in the treatment of diseases caused by protozoa, such as
malaria [s], toxoplasmosis [9] and pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia [lo]. however, the classical antifolates have not been clinically useful in the
treatment of diseases caused by other parasitic
protozoa.

in contrast, mtx is an extremely potent inhibitor of dhfr from all sources. it is used in
the treatment of neoplasia but shows marginal
selective toxicity. binding kinetics of mtx with
its target have been studied with dhfrs from
several sources [ 11,121. these studies indicated
that the complexes initially formed undergo some
kind of conformational
change, the effect of
which is to increase the tightness of binding.
since the chemotherapy of chagas’ disease, of
which the etiological agent is trypanosoma cruzi,
remains an unsolved problem, the identification
and exploitation of the clear differences between
dhfrs from the parasite and its mammalian
host should allow for the development of effective
drugs. we have previously performed the purification and characterization of dhfr-ts from t.
crud [13] and now we report the heterologous
expression, purification and characterization
of
the individual dhfr domain. with a smaller
 xxxg1289xxx  will presumably be easier to perform a
structural analysis and to apply techniques like
nuclear magnetic resonance since the bifuctional
homodimeric enzyme is considered too large for
such detailed studies. likewise, the availability of
the domain will allow a better understanding of
the structure and function of the bifunctional
enzyme which might contribute towards a rational
design of specifically targeted drugs.

2. materials and methods
2.1. materials

all reagents used were purchased from sigma
and of the highest purity available. dihydrofolate
was prepared from  xxxd2146xxx  by the method of
blakey [14]. mtx-sepharose was obtained as described [ 151. complex bacteriological media were
from difco laboratories, and all media were prepared as described [ 161. [35s] xxxd1148xxx -‘s triethylammonium salt (400 ci/mmol) for dna sequencing
was supplied by amersham international. restriction endonucleases, taq polymerase, t4 dna
ligase and restriction enzymes were purchased
from boehringer mannheim biochemicals. the
ts and dhfr deficient e. co/i pa414 was a gift

from drs ahrweiler and frieden (university
medical school, st. louis). oligonucleotides were
synthesized by the analytical services at the instituto de parasitologia y biomedicina, granada.
2.2. dna manipulations
general methods for dna manipulations were
as described [16]. dna fragments were purified
by agarose gel electrophoresis using genecleana
kit (biolol).

177

cells were grown at 37°c to an a,,, of 0.5-0.7,
and protein expression was then induced with 1
mm isopropyl thiogalactoside and grown for a
further 3-6 h. recombinant dhfr domain was
purified by methotrexate-sepharose
affinity chromatography as described for the bifunctional enzymes of l. major [6,18] and t. cruzi [13],
followed by anion-exchange chromatography in a
mono q hr5/5 column from pharmacia as reported for the bifunctional enzyme of plasmodium
falciparum [19]. bifunctional dhfr-ts from t.
cruzi was obtained as described [13].

2.3. expression system construction
2.5. protein analysis
the coding sequence for the dhfr domain
was amplified from the plasmid ptc4.5 which
contains a 4.5kb fragment of t. cruzi genomic
dna with the complete dhfr-ts sequence. we
used the oligonucleotides
dhfrstart
and
dhfrstop as terminal primers. dhfrstart, 5’ttgaattcatgtcgctgtttaa-3’,

on the coding strand and contains a start codon
(bold) and a ecori site (underlined). dhfrstop,
primes
s-gtctgcagctagttgcgtgg-3’,
on the non-coding strand and carries a psti site
(underlined) and an engineered stop codon (bold).
the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was carried
out under  xxxd2648xxx  in a volume of 50 ~1. the
reaction buffer contained 400 pm dntps, 2 mm
mgcl,, 25 pmol of each sense and antisense
primers, 250 ng of plasmid dna and 2.5 ~1 of
taq polymerase. pcr parameters were: 5 min at
95°c (1 cycle); 1 min at 95°c 1 min 30 s at 45°c
and a 2 min at 72°c (35 cycles); 10 min at 72°c
1 cycle. after digestion of the purified pcr
product with ecori and psti, it was cloned in
pkk223.3 (pharmacia). the expression construct
(pktcd) was propagated
in xll-blue cells
(stratagene). double strand dna was sequenced
by the dideoxy method 1171, using the sequenase
version 2.0 from u.s. biochemical
corp.
reagents. pktcd was used to transform the e.
coli strains jm105 (laclq) (pharmacia) and pa414.
2.4. purijcation of the dhfr domain
bacterial clones were grown at 37°c in lb [16]
containing 100 ,ug ml - ’ of ampicillin. the laciq

protein determinations [20], electrophoresis on
sds-page and staining with coomassie blue
r250 [21] were performed as described. the relative molecular mass of the dhfr domain in the
native state was determined by gel filtration using
a superose-12 hr lo/30 column from pharmacia.
the equilibration and chromatography was performed in potassium phosphate 50 mm, ph 7.0;
nacl 0.15 m, at flow rate 0.5 ml min - ‘. the
column was calibrated with a mix of proteins of
molecular masses ranging from 13.7 to 67 kda
purchased from pharmacia.
2.6. enzyme assays
dhfr activity determinations were performed
spectrophotometrically
by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm at 25°c [22]. the
standard assay contained 100 pm h,folate, 100
pm nadph. 50 mm tes, ph 7.0, and 75 mm
2- xxxd26xxx .
the reactions were initiated
by addition of about 10 units of enzyme. one unit
of enzyme activity is the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 nmol min _ ’ of product at
25°c using e of 12 300 m - ’ cm ’ at 340 nm.
2.7. determination of kinetic parameters
k,,, values for nadph and h,folate were obtained from kinetic assays by varying the substrate at subsaturating concentrations and fixing
the other substrate at saturating concentrations.
non-linear least squares fit of the data to the

and 0.3 nm of dhfr domain and bifunctional
enzyme, respectively, and the concentration of
h,folate was 15 ,um. determinations for each
inhibitor concentration were performed in duplicate.

mtx inhibition was analyzed in experiments
where both substrates, nadph and h,folate,
were kept at saturating concentrations and the
concentration of mtx was varied between 0 and
20 nm. the reactions were initiated with 0.85 nm
of protein in the case of the bifunctional enzyme
and 2.4 nm of protein, in the case of the dhfr
domain. the onset of mtx inhibition was analyzed as described [23] for slow-binding inhibitors
according
to the following kinetic scheme
(scheme i), where e represents the dhfr domain or the bifunctional enzyme, a represents

2.10. determination of the apparent

rate of

the rate of mtx dissociation was determined
by a competitive method incubating the preformed radioactive ternary complex [3h]mtxnadph-enzyme with an excess of cold mtx.
the radioactive complex was obtained by incubating the protein with 100 ,ljm nadph and
[3h]mtx (37 ci mmol~ ‘; nen research products) in 1.2 ml of 50 mm tes (ph 7.4), 2 mm
dtt, and 1 mm edta, at 25”c, for 45 min (in
the case of the dhfr domain the buffer contained also 8%  xxxd2982xxx  3350). the
concentration of radioactive mtx was 0.1 ,um
for the bifunctional enzyme and 0.9 pm for the
dhfr domain. the dissociation was initiated by
addition of 100 ,um of cold mtx and the release
of the [3h]mtx was followed separating the
macromolecular-bound
from free [3h]mtx by
filtering loo-~1 aliquots of the reaction mix on
small columns of sephadex g-15 by a slight modification of a previously described method (41 and
measuring the radioactivity of the complex isolated. the protein concentration in the experiments was 16.9 nm for the bifunctional enzyme
and 200 nm for the monofunctional domain.

3. results
3.1. gene cloning and expression

and secbased on homology comparisons
ondary structure predictions with the previously
reported dhfr-ts of t. cruzi [ 131, we considered up to residue asn234 as the dhfr domain
of the bifunctional enzyme. by means of pcr we
amplified the considered domain introducing a
stop codon after asn234. the pcr product yields
a single product of approximately 700 bp, which
was purified from agarose, digested with ecori
and psti, and cloned in pkk223.3 to give pktcd. pktcd was initially propagated in xllblue cells and the authenticity of the construct
was confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing. the plasmid was used to transform
several e. coli strains which were grown under
suitable conditions of expression. enzyme activity
determinations revealed the expression of a catalytically active dhfr in every e. coli strain
checked. however, the expression level was somewhat low (o.l-0.2%) and the protein was undetectable by sds-page stained with coomassie
blue.
3.2. purification and characterization of the t.
cruzi dhfr domain
the dhfr domain of t. cruzi was purified
from pa414 e. coli cells to homogeneity. purification was performed by mtx-sepharose affinity
using the same conditions as those described for
the t. cruzi bifunctional enzyme [13], although an
additional anion-exchange chromatography
step
in a mono q column was necessary (table 1). the
purified product displayed a single 27-kda band

on sds-page (fig. i), which is in agreement
with the size expected from the amino acid sequence (25 768 da). the molecular mass of the
native dhfr domain obtained by gel filtration
was approximately 20 kda, which indicated that
it behaved as a monomer. the purified protein
was highly stable, and there was no loss of activity after long incubations at room temperature
and after several cycles of freezing-unfreezing.
however, the protein underwent a progressive
loss of activity when it was diluted at concentrations below 6 peg ml - ‘. this effect was prevented
by adding  xxxd2982xxx  at 8% in the elution
buffer. the specific activity of the purified dhfr
domain was 38 000 u mg ~ ‘, which is similar to
the specific activity obtained for the bifunctional
enzyme.
the k, values for nadph and h,folate were
16 & 1 and 0.75 + 0.06 pm, respectively. taking
into consideration that the domain exists as a
monomer and using the value of 25 768 da as the
molecular mass of the enzyme, we obtained a k,,,
value of 16.5 +0.5 s-‘. table 2 summarizes the
kinetic parameters of the dhfr domain compared to those of the bifunctional protein [13].
we have compared the effects of ph and concentration of kc1 on t. cruzi dhfr-ts and the
dhfr domain (fig. 2). both proteins displayed a
ph-independent activity between ph 6.1 and 7.2,
while the activity declined at basic ph, with half
maximal activity around ph 8. kc1 activated the
dhfrs from both sources approximately 40%, in
the range of salt concentrations spanning between
0.05 and 0.25 m. both proteins were very stable
at high kc1 concentrations
and at 1 m the
dhfr domain and the bifunctional enzyme conserved 55 and 36% activity, respectively.

3.3. inhibition by tmp and pyr
tmp and pyr were tested as antifolate inhibitors of dhfr activity. the progress of the
reaction versus the time at different concentrations of the inhibitors displayed straight lines for
both, the t. cruzi dhfr domain and wild-type
bifunctional enzyme, which confirmed the competitive character of tmp and pyr (data not
shown). ki values and i,, data for the related
inhibitors are shown in table 3.
3.4. analysis of the interaction with mtx
the inhibition of both proteins in the presence
of mtx led to two-asymptotic progress curves of
the reaction versus time (fig. 3), indicating the
slow-binding character of mtx [23]. the form of
the progress curves could be interpreted assuming
a two-step inhibition process (scheme 1, table 4),
where the initial step involves a rapid formation
of a initial enzyme-inhibitor complex that subsequently undergoes a slow isomerization. from
analysis of the progress curves we determined that

the overall mtx inhibition constant, kt, for the
t. cruzi dhfr domain was 9.2 pm, 2-fold higher
than for the wild-type bifunctional enzyme, which
was 4.9 pm. the inhibition constant for the initial
inhibitory complex, ki, was also approximately
2-fold increased (ki 400 pm) compared to the
bifunctional enzyme (ki = 230 pm). the low values of ki for both proteins indicated that binding
is tight in the initial complex. however, the subsequent isomerization is also significant and increases the tightness of mtx binding to both
proteins about 45-fold. the values obtained for
the rate constants of direct, k,, and reversal, kg,
isomerization were 2.3 min ~ ’ and 0.051 min - ’
for the wild-type enzyme and 4.7 and 0.11 min ~ i
for the dhfr domain, respectively. the ratio
k,lk, governs the isomerization process and in the
present case, where k5 >>k,, its value agrees with
the ratio k,/kt, for both enzymes. the rate of
mtx release from the ternary complex is limited
by the rate of reversal isomerization and the
effective off-rate is indicated by the apparent rate
constant of dissociation, kor,app.the dissociation

of a single first-order process, with koirapp values
of 0.034 min --’ for the wild-type enzyme and
0.040 min ~ ’ for the dhfr domain, which corresponded with a t,,? of 20 and 17 min, respectively.
from the [3h]mtx dissociation experiments we
determined that 0.8 mol of mtx were bound per
mol of dimeric bifunctional enzyme indicating
that the stochiometry of mtx binding was 1: 1,
which agrees with the observation made using the
l. major [6] and crithidia fasciculata [3] enzymes.
the dhfr domain also bound 1 mol of mtx
per mol of monomeric protein indicating that the
stochiometry is 1:l and that the domain is 100%
active.

4. discussion
dhfr-ts from t. cruzi is a bifunctional enzyme in which the two catalytic activities are
located on the same polypeptide chain. the
dhfr domain is at the amino terminus. although it is the more variable domain, it conserves high similarities with other dhfrs,
especially with regard to the residues assigned to

nadph and h,folate binding [24-261. in contrast, the homology at the carboxy terminus of
the dhfr domain, is not well defined [13] and
the algorithms of secondary structure prediction
[27,28] do not indicate the b-sheets, /‘-g and
b-h, which are observed in all the dhfrs of
known tertiary structure. however, secondary
structure analysis for the complete t. cruzi
dhfr-ts predicts an a-helix spanning from
arg235 to glu250, which is present at the solved
structures of the lactobacillus casei and e. coli
tss [29,30], and in addition, significant homology
between the dhfr-ts of t. cruzi and other tss
begins at arg235 [13]. therefore, we chose
asn234 as the last amino acid belonging to the
dhfr domain and expressed it under the tat
promoter in the expression vector pkk223.3.
asn234 aligns with asn231 in plakmodium falciparum which has also been successfully selected as
the last amino acid in the expression of the
dhfr domain [31].
the catalytically active dhfr domain was
purified to homogeneity by means of mtx
affinity chromatography
followed by anion-exchange chromatography
in a mono q column.
several properties were similar to those of the
wild-type bifunctional enzyme; it was very stable

and presented a specific activity of around 37 000
u rng- i. in contrast, the native t. cruzi dhfr
domain behaved as a monomer of 20 kda upon
gel filtration, which suggested that if direct contacts exist between the dhfr domains in the
dimer, they must be weak and assisted by others
much stronger belonging to the ts domains. both
the dhfr domain and the wild-type enzyme
showed similar kinetic properties. kc1 activated
both enzymes and the activity was ph-independent from ph 6 to 7.0, declining rapidly when the
ph increased. the effect of ph on dhfr activity
resembled that described for the bacterial enzymes
[32-341. in contrast, dhfr from vertebrates are
ph independent from ph 6 to 9 [35-371. the k,
values determined for nadph and h,folate were
in good agreement with those obtained previously
for the bifunctional enzyme [13] although the k,,,
for the t. cruzi dhfr domain was 16.5 s-‘,
while the k,,, for the bifunctional enzyme was 36
s- ’ (per monomer). these small differences observed between the kinetic parameters, could be
due to the cancellation of interactions that existed
in the bifunctional enzyme. however, these interactions are not required for catalysis and the t.
cruzi dhfr domain is practically as efficient as
the wild-type enzyme.
dhfr-ts from t. cruzi is not potently inhibited by the classical anti-microbial antifolates
tmp and pyr, which were in addition poorer
inhibitors of the dhfr domain compared to
wild-type dhfr-ts.
this low sensitivity of
dhfr to tmp and pyr has been previously
reported in assays performed with t. cruzi crude
extracts [38]. the sensitivity of t. cruzi dhfr to
these analogues was increased with regard to l.
major
dhfr [39], and is more similar to the

human enzyme (k,tmp = 110 nm; k,pyr = 65
nm) than to most microbial enzymes. for example the kipyr (employed as an anti-malarial) for
dhfr-ts from p. falciparum is 0.1 nm [19] and
the k,tmp (employed as a bactericidal) for the
dhfr from e. coli is 0.08 nm [40]. this low
sensitivity of t. cruzi dhfr to tmp and pyr
could be one of the possible reasons why they
have not been useful in the treatment of chagas’
disease.
mtx was a potent inhibitor of both the dhfr
domain and the wild-type bifunctional enzyme
from t. cruzi. as in the case of bacterial dhfrs
[41,42,1 l] and vertebrate dhfrs such as chicken
[40,41] and human [12], the pattern of mtx
inhibition can be interpreted in terms of an initial
step of binding of the inhibitor followed by an
isomerization of the initial complex formed. in
the case of the dhfr domain and dhfr-ts
from t. cruzi, this potential conformational
change contributed in the same measure to the
overall binding of mtx, increasing tightness of
binding by a factor of about 45. however, the
initial step of mtx binding is slightly modified in
the case of the t. cruzi dhfr domain and the
inhibition constant, k,, is approximately 2-fold
increased, being the reason why the overall inhibition constant of mtx, kt, is also elevated 2-fold.
on the other hand, the ki of the initial step of
mtx-binding is comparable to the one-step binding of competitive inhibitors such as tmp and
pyr, whose ki values were also increased compared to those of the t. cruzi bifunctional enzyme. the inhibition by mtx of t. cruzi dhfr
is more similar to the human enzyme than to e.
coli dhfr [12]. thus, in the case of the human
enzyme, the ki of the initial inhibitory complex is

of dhfr activity. (a) progress curves for mtx inhibition
of dhfr-ts
of t. cruzi. reactions
were
initiated with 0.85 nm of enzyme. (b) progress curves for the dhfr domain of t. cruzi. reactions were initiated with 2.4 nm of
enzyme. the concentration
of mtx is indicated for each curve

200 nm and the isomerization process increases
the overall binding 60-fold. in contrast, for e. coli
dhfr, the k, of the initial inhibitory complex is
2.4 pm and the contribution of the conformational change to overall binding of mtx is only
3-fold [ 111.
there is experimental evidence showing the existence of dhfr interactions in l. major dhfrts. however it is unclear if such interactions
occur directly, via dhfr-dhfr
contacts, or
indirectly, through the ts domains. the present
results, and previous reports with the bifunctional
enzymes of crithidiu fasciculatu [3] and l. major
[6] showed that, despite the fact that the enzyme
has two folate binding sites, only one can bind
mtx. hence, functional dhfr-dhfr
domain
communication should exist, as binding of mtx
to one domain prevents binding to the other. in

contrast, this communication disappears in the t.
cwzi dhfr
domain, which behaves as a
monomer upon gel filtration and where every
folate binding site can bind mtx. moreover, the
x-ray structure of l. major dhfr-ts [7] does
not evidence physical dhfr-dhfr
interactions
and, surprisingly, the two folate binding sites of
each dhfr domain are occupied by mtx. however, the crystals were obtained under conditions
in which the ts sites were taken up by inhibitors
(fdump and lo-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate)
and
it is possible that under this situation, dhfrdhfr contacts have been canceled. indeed, it
has been observed that partial proteolysis of the
ts domain of l. major dhfr-ts produced ts
inactivation and a loss of dhfr-dhfr interactions, reflected by the fact that each dhfr domain could bind one mol of mtx [43]. if physical
dhfr-dhfr interactions are weak and assisted
by stronger ones between the ts domains, the
perturbation or inhibition of the ts domain could
modify those interactions. hence, it is possible
that contacts between dhfr domains exist in the
bifunctional enzyme although a crystal structure
of the free enzyme would be required to evidence
them.
in summary, we have expressed the dhfr
domain of t. cruzi dhfr-ts as a catalytically
active protein. the purified t. crwi dhfr domain has similar properties and similar kinetic
parameters to the wild-type enzyme. kinetic ex-

k, and k, values were obtained from the progress curves. the k,,, values for hzfolate were 1.2 and 0.75 pm for the t. cruzi
bifunctional enzyme and the dhfr domain, respectively. the hzfolate concentration used in these assays was 62.5 pm.~k, for the

periments with ts coupled to the dhfr domain
are now possible and obtaining a structure may
be easier than for the bifunctional protein. the
availability of the dhfr domain from t. cvuzi
dhfr-ts could help in the understanding of
special features of the bifunctional enzyme and
facilitate the rational design of specific drugs for
treatment of chagas’ disease.
