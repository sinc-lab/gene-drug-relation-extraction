nasal polyps are the common end-point of a number of conditions characterised by inflammation and are rarely ‘curable’ in its true sense. after consideration of the underlying aetiology and confirmation of the diagnosis, they are
normally managed by a combination of medical and surgical interventions. of
these, topical corticosteroids have proved to be the medical treatment of choice.
the objectives of the medical management are to eliminate or reduce the size
of polyps, re-establish nasal airway and nasal breathing, improve or restore the
sense of smell, and prevent recurrence of nasal polyps. the mechanism of action
of corticosteroids may be by a multifactorial effect on various aspects of the
inflammatory reaction, the effect being initiated by their binding to a specific
cytoplasmic  xxxg1601xxx . at a cellular level, there is a reduction in
the number of antigen-presenting cells, in the number and activation of t cells,
in the number of mast cells, and in the number and activation of eosinophils.
when polyps are large (grade 3) topical medication is difficult to instil in a
very blocked nose and surgery or short term systemic corticosteroids may be
required. topical corticosteroids are of use in the primary treatment of nasal polyps
when they are of a small or medium size (grades 1 and 2) and in the maintenance
of any therapeutic improvement.
the efficacy of topical corticosteroids such as betamethasone sodium phosphate
nose drops,  xxxd294xxx ,  xxxd2145xxx  and budesonide
nasal sprays in reducing polyp size and rhinitis symptoms has been demonstrated
in several randomised, placebo-controlled trials.  xxxd294xxx ,
 xxxd2126xxx  and budesonide sprays have also been shown to delay the recurrence
of polyps after surgery. placebo-controlled studies of agents that have shown a
significant clinical effect in the management of nasal polyposis are reviewed.

nasal polyposis is a common clinical condition
that, despite differing hypotheses on its cause, remains a poorly understood disease. histologically,
polyps consist of respiratory epithelium covering
very oedematous stroma infiltrated by a number of
inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, mast cells
and lymphocytes.[1]
for most patients the management of nasal polyps comprises a combination of medical and surgical therapies, but it is important to consider possible
aetiological factors and association with systemic
diseases such as asthma and intolerance to aspirin,
cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and immune deficiency,[2] and to exclude the possibility
of inverted papilloma, allergic fungal sinusitis or an
underlying neoplasm in all cases before treatment.
1. objectives of treatment
in discussing and comparing different types of
therapy it is useful to define the objectives for
management. these are (i) the elimination of nasal
polyps or a considerable reduction of their size;
(ii) re-establishing an open nasal airway and nasal
breathing; (iii) improvement and/or restoration of
the sense of smell; and (iv) prevention of recurrence of nasal polyps, although realistically a delay
of recurrence is anticipated rather than the elimination of all sinus pathology.[3]
2. mechanisms of corticosteroid effect
topical corticosteroids are the medical treatment of choice in nasal polyposis. the introduction
of modern corticosteroid sprays in the 1970s was
followed by a series of studies that shed light upon
the effect of corticosteroids on various aspects of
the inflammatory reaction in the airway mucosa.[4]
corticosteroids have a multifactorial effect initiated by their binding to a specific cytoplasmic
 xxxg1601xxx . within hours of administration, the drug-receptor complex modifies gene
transcription and induces a change of protein synthesis within the cell. although the individual response of patients is variable, this change of protein
synthesis is responsible for the clinical effect which

becomes apparent within a matter of days in nasal
polyposis.
2.1 t cells and cytokines

there is accumulating evidence that the inflammatory reaction in nasal polyposis is at least in part
driven by t cells and their humoral products, the
cytokines. kanai et al.[5] have shown that corticosteroids significantly alter t-cell kinetics by reducing the total number of lymphocytes, their activation and cytokine production.
2.2 mast cells

the role of mast cells in nasal polyposis is unclear but prolonged corticosteroid treatment in the
airways reduces the number of mast cells in asthma
and allergic rhinitis, and may well be of importance
in nasal polyposis. stem cell factor, a mast cell
growth and survival factor produced by fibroblasts,
appears to be suppressed by corticosteroid treatment.[6]
2.3 eosinophils

topical corticosteroids reduce the influx and total number of eosinophils in polyp tissue. corticosteroids may inhibit the influx of these cells by
suppressing the production of regulated upon
activation, normal t cell expressed and secreted
( xxxg363xxx ), a cytokine released by fibroblasts
probably involved in eosinophil recruitment.[7] recent research demonstrates that apoptosis (programmed cell death) in inflammatory cells is an
important factor in the resolution of inflammation,
and apoptosis is induced in eosinophils in cell culture with corticosteroids.[8]
3. classification and staging of
nasal polyps
a system for classifying and staging nasal polyposis should be universally adopted to allow for
accurate comparison of different therapies and of
the same therapies in different series. at an international workshop on nasal polyposis in davos,
switzerland, in march 1996, the system described

this system grades polyps (table i), allows for the
inclusion of systemic diagnoses that may influence
outcome, and scores the extent of disease on computerise tomography (ct) scan (table ii).
4. topical corticosteroid treatment
intranasal corticosteroids are the best documented treatment for nasal polyps and there are several
placebo-controlled studies that have shown a significant clinical effect. however, nasal corticosteroids alone do not solve all problems for patients
with nasal polyps. this may be because the patient
is genuinely unresponsive to corticosteroids as
may occur in cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and other diseases characterised by a predominately neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic
infiltration.[12] also, the disease can be temporarily
unresponsive because of inadequate delivery of the
medication in a very blocked nose with grade 3
polyps or with purulent infection. in this clinical

situation, systemic corticosteroid therapy or surgery may be necessary in the first instance followed by subsequent topical therapy. topical corticosteroids are of use in the primary treatment of
nasal polyps, once the diagnosis has been established, and in the maintenance of any therapeutic
improvement. table iii shows the range of intranasal corticosteroids that may be used. they are
broadly divided into drops and sprays. moreover,
budesonide is delivered as a powder with the aid
of a  xxxd379xxx .
to overcome the potential systemic effect associated with betamethasone while preserving the
advantage of direct instillation of medication into
the upper nasal cavity, fluticasone has been developed in a drop form.[13] this is available in individually packaged metered doses, which are also
used in the ‘head down and forwards position’. the
efficacy of intranasal corticosteroid sprays such as
 xxxd294xxx  (beclomethasone),
budesonide and  xxxd2145xxx  in reducing
polyp size and rhinitis symptoms has been demonstrated in several placebo-controlled trials.  xxxd2126xxx , budesonide and  xxxd294xxx  have been shown to delay the recurrence of
polyps after surgery. table iv summarises these
medical trials.
a review of the evidence from controlled trials
reveals that all studies of topical corticosteroids have
shown an effect on nasal blockage but less improvement in olfaction. polyps may shrink or may
no longer be visible on anterior rhinoscopy in approximately 50% of patients.
only betamethasone drops,  xxxd294xxx , budesonide and fluticasone have been
recognised in the primary treatment of nasal polyps.
for many years we have advocated the use of
betamethasone sodium phosphate drops in the ‘head
down and forwards’ position as the optimum way
of introducing the medication to the upper part of
the nasal cavity. chalton et al.[14] found disappearance of polyps in 9 of 15 patients using betamethasone drops compared with 2 of 15 in the placebo
group. however, a disadvantage of the betamethasone drops has always been the difficulty in accudrugs 2001; 61 (5)

rately estimating the amount of medication instilled
and it may be that the significant improvement experienced by patients is due to a small systemic absorption of the drug, equivalent to approximately
prednisone 0.5 mg/day.
initial studies of  xxxd294xxx [15,16] showed it to be effective in the treatment
of nasal polyps. a more recent placebo-controlled
study by lund et al.[17] compared beclomethasone
dipropionate with fluticasone and showed that both
sprays were equally effective in treating the symptoms of severe nasal polyps. nasal blockage was
significantly decreased in both active groups compared with the placebo group, the polyp score was
significantly decreased in the fluticasone group,
the peak nasal inspiratory flow rate was greater in
the fluticasone group and the nasal cavity volume
was significantly increased in both groups. there

was some evidence that the group treated with
fluticasone responded faster than the group receiving beclomethasone. this is in accordance with the
results reported by holmberg et al.[18] in which a
significant reduction in polyp size was seen in patients after 14 weeks’ treatment with fluticasone or
with beclomethasone, but with evidence that fluticasone has a faster onset of action.
the literature contains 6 controlled studies of
budesonide. lildholdt et al.[19] found a decrease in
the mean polyp size in 52% of budesonide-treated
patients compared with 21% in the placebo group
at the end of 3 months. similarly, nasal peak flow
could be shown to improve significantly over a 4month period in patients using budesonide compared with those using placebo. johansen et al.[20]
found a clear reduction in polyp score and an improvement in nasal peak flow during treatment

with budesonide. other studies have also shown
increased nasal patency measured by nasal peak
flow during active therapy with budesonide.[21-23]
all studies have shown an effect on the sensation
of nasal blockage, but the effect on rhinorrhoea and
sneezing is more varied. tos et al.[24] assessed the
patients’ overall evaluation of treatment efficacy
of the 2 formulations of budesonide (aqueous and
powder) and placebo. the proportion of patients
rating substantial control of symptoms after 6
weeks’ treatment was 60% in the aqueous- and
48% in the  xxxd379xxx -treated groups, compared
with 29% in the placebo-treated group.
many patients find the loss of sense of smell and
appreciation of flavour one of the most disturbing
symptoms of nasal polyposis but only a few studies
have looked at the effect of intranasal corticosteroids on these symptoms in an objective way. elnaggar et al.[25] studied the possible benefit of  xxxd294xxx  on olfactory function
in 29 patients postnasal polypectomy. the university of pennsylvania smell identification test (upsit) was performed and they found no statistically
significant difference in the scores between treated
and untreated nostrils.
although polyps shrink during topical corticosteroid therapy, they are not eliminated from the
upper part of the nasal cavity, which is not reached
by a nasal spray. polypoid tissue in the nose can be
identified even after systemic corticosteroids or
radical surgery. it is therefore in maintenance therapy where intranasal corticosteroids probably have
their greatest role.  xxxd2126xxx , budesonide and
 xxxd294xxx  have been shown to
delay the recurrence of polyps after surgery. dingsor
et al.[26] performed polypectomy and then treated
18 patients with  xxxd2126xxx  and 19 patients with
placebo for 12 months. at the end of the treatment
period, polyps were more frequent and larger in the
placebo group than in the  xxxd2126xxx  group. an
earlier study by drettner et al.[27] showed the same
beneficial effect of  xxxd2126xxx  following polypectomy. budesonide spray significantly reduces the
requirement for repeated polypectomies.[28] during a 30-month post-polypectomy observation pe© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

riod of 20 patients treated with beclomethasone
dipropionate, karlsson and rundcrantz[29] found it
necessary to perform only 4 repeat polypectomies
compared with 14 in the untreated control group.
 xxxd294xxx  was also found to be
effective in the reduction of symptomatic recurrence in 54% of actively treated patients in a study
by virolainen and puhakka.[30] although the reappearance of nasal polyps can be prevented in some
cases, it would appear that in most patients the use
of topical corticosteroids will reduce the frequency
of relapses.
5. discussion
the treatment plan of nasal polyposis should be
tailored for each individual patient but most will
require a combination of medical and surgical therapy to deal with clinical recurrences that characterise this condition. it has been shown that topical
corticosteroid treatment can reduce polyp size and
the majority of associated nasal symptoms. the
initial management of patients with small or medium sized polyps (grades 1 and 2) may be with
topical corticosteroids and it may be that the drop
formulations are the most effective. the potential
systemic effects of betamethasone drops has led to
the development of a drop version of fluticasone
propionate, which might be anticipated to have little in the way of measurable systemic effects. studies need to be conducted on the effectiveness of
this preparation in nasal polyposis. however, as
already stated, when polyps are large it may be
difficult to instil the medication, and surgery or
short term systemic corticosteroids may be required.
treatment after polypectomy significantly reduces the number of recurrences, which is especially valuable in patients who have previously
been subjected to frequent polypectomies. thus,
topical corticosteroid sprays are of considerable
value for long term maintenance but with the
knowledge that from time to time the other strategies may be necessary, and this of course will be
influenced by other factors such as the presence of
asthma and/or aspirin sensitivity. in theory ‘long

term therapy’ could imply ‘life-long’ therapy but
in practice, most patients will eventually stop treatment if they remain asymptomatic. trials looking
at postoperative topical corticosteroid therapy for
5 years or longer are being conducted but results
are not as yet available.
the safety profile of modern topical corticosteroids as evidenced by studies in rhinitis would
not raise any significant concerns, particularly
when balanced against the reduction in morbidity
and need for surgical intervention.[31]
