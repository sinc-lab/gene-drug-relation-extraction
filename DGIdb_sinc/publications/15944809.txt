 xxxd3504xxx  prevents torsade de pointes by
reduction of transmural dispersion of
repolarization and suppression of early
afterdepolarizations in an intact heart model
of  xxxg2028xxx 

쮿 abstract background in long qt syndrome (lqts), prolongation of the
qt-interval is associated with sudden cardiac death resulting from potentially life-threatening polymorphic tachycardia of the torsade de pointes
(tdp) type. experimental as well as clinical reports support the hypothesis
that calcium channel blockers such as  xxxd3504xxx  may be an appropriate therapeutic approach in lqts. we investigated the electrophysiologic mechanism by which  xxxd3504xxx  suppresses tdp, in a recently developed intact heart
model of  xxxg2028xxx . methods and results in 8 langendorff-perfused rabbit
hearts, veratridine (0.1 µm), an inhibitor of sodium channel inactivation, led
to a marked increase in qt-interval and simultaneously recorded monophasic ventricular action potentials (maps) (p < 0.05) thereby mimicking  xxxg2028xxx .
in bradycardic (av-blocked) hearts, simultaneous recording of up to eight
epi- and endocardial maps demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase in total dispersion of repolarization (56%, p < 0.05) and reverse frequency-dependence.
after lowering potassium concentration, veratridine reproducibly led to early
afterdepolarizations (eads) and tdp in 6 of 8 (75%) hearts. additional infusion of  xxxd3504xxx  (0.75 µm) suppressed eads and consecutively tdp in all
hearts.  xxxd3504xxx  significantly shortened endocardial but not epicardial
maps which resulted in signiﬁcant reduction of ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization. conclusion  xxxd3504xxx  is highly effective in preventing tdp via shortening of endocardial maps, reduction of left ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization and suppression of eads in an
intact heart model of  xxxg2028xxx . these data suggest a possible therapeutic role of
 xxxd3504xxx  in the treatment of  xxxg2028xxx  patients.

introduction

brc 533

the long qt syndrome (lqts) is characterized by prolongation of the qt-interval which is associated with
sudden cardiac death resulting from polymorphic tachycardia of the torsade de pointes (tdp) type. more than
250 mutations in seven genes (lqts 1-7) have been
described. mutations involve genes encoding potassium

channels ( xxxg1268xxx , 2, 5, and 6, jervell-lange-nielsen (jln)
1 and 2) and ankyrin b (lqt4), which acts as a targeting
and anchoring molecule for the sodium channel [5]. in
 xxxg2028xxx ,  xxxg2028xxx  was found to be the responsible gene [29].
it is located on chromosome 3 and encodes for the cardiac fast sodium channel. mutations lead to a persistent
component of a small inward depolarizing ion current
(ina) via continued re-opening of the sodium channel.
this small inward sodium current is sufﬁcient to delay

repolarization and to prolong the qt-interval [30]. we
have recently developed a novel intact heart model of
 xxxg2028xxx  [23] that reproduces the expected electrophysiological alterations using veratridine, an inhibitor of
sodium channel inactivation [11]. we were able to
demonstrate that veratridine reproducibly causes early
afterdepolarizations (eads) and tdp due to signiﬁcantly
increased left ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization in bradycardic and hypokalemic hearts. based
on these experimental data, reduction of transmural dispersion of repolarization may be effective in preventing
tdp. this is supported by recent clinical data. the
pafac trial (prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardioversion) [10] showed a higher incidence of proarrhythmia in patients treated with sotalol (2  160 mg) as
compared to patients taking the combination of quinidine (3  160 mg) and  xxxd3504xxx  (3  80 mg). as  xxxd3504xxx  might therefore have an “antitorsadogenic” potential, the aim of this study was to investigate the electrophysiologic effects of  xxxd3504xxx  on eads, tdp and particularly on transmural dispersion of repolarization in
this intact heart model.

methods
all experimental protocols were approved by the local
animal care committee and conformed with the guide for
the care and use of laboratory animals published by the
us national institutes of health (nih publication no.
852-3, revised 1996).

preparation of hearts for perfusion
the method has been described previously [6, 8, 21–23].
in summary, male new zealand white rabbits (n = 8)
weighing 2.5–3.0 kg were anesthetized with sodium
thiopental (200–300 mg iv.). after midsternal incision
and opening of the pericardium, the hearts were removed
and immediately placed in an ice-cold krebs-henseleit
solution (composition in mm: cacl2 1.80, kcl 4.70,
kh2po4 1.18,  xxxd2534xxx  0.83, nacl 118, nahco3 24.88, napyruvate 2.0 and d-glucose 5.55). the aorta was cannulated, the pulmonary artery was incised, and the spontaneously beating hearts were retrogradely perfused via
the aorta at constant ﬂow (52 ml/min) with warm (36.8 to
37.2 °c) krebs-henseleit solution. perfusion pressure
was kept stable at 100 mm hg. the hearts were placed in
a heated, solution-ﬁlled tissue bath. after cannulation,
the hearts were given 10 minutes to stabilize. the perfusate was equilibrated with 95% o2 and 5% co2 (ph
7.35; 37 °c). the cannulated and perfused hearts were
attached to a vertical langendorff apparatus (hugo sachs

elektronik, medical research instrumentation, marchhugstetten, germany). a deflated latex balloon was
inserted into the left ventricle and connected to a pressure transducer to control hemodynamic stability. the
atrioventricular (av) node was ablated by a surgical
tweezers under ecg-control to slow the intrinsic heart
rate. this resulted in complete av-dissociation with a
ventricular escape rate below 60 beats per minute.

electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic
measurements
a volume-conducted ecg was recorded by complete
immersion of the heart into a bath of krebs-henseleit
solution that had been thermally equilibrated with the
myocardial perfusate. signals from a simulated
“einthoven” conﬁguration were ampliﬁed by a standard
ecg ampliﬁer (ﬁlter settings: 0.1–300 hz). monophasic
action potential (map) recording and stimulation were
accomplished simultaneously using contact map-pacing
catheters (ep technologies, mountain view, ca, usa).
the map electrograms were ampliﬁed and ﬁltered (low
pass 0.1 hz, high pass 300 hz). maps were analyzed using
a software speciﬁcally designed by franz et al. [9] permitting precise deﬁnition of the amplitude and duration
of the digitized signals. qt-interval was analyzed manually. the recordings were considered reproducible and,
therefore, acceptable for analysis only if they had a stable
baseline amplitude with a variation of less than 20% and
a stable duration (map duration at 90% repolarization
(map90) was reproducible within 4 ms). maps were
recorded simultaneously. seven maps were evenly
spread in a circular pattern around the epicardium of
both ventricles (ﬁve on the left ventricle, two on the right
ventricle), one map was recorded from the left-ventricular endocardium. one of the right-ventricular catheters
was used to pace the heart. pacing at twice diastolic
threshold was performed for one minute at each cycle
length (cl) from 900 to 300 ms using a programmable
stimulator (universal programmable stimulator, uhs
20, biotronik, germany) which delivered square-wave
pulses of 2 ms pulse width. all data were digitized at a rate
of 1 khz with 12 bit resolution and subsequently stored
on a removable hard disk (bard labsystem, bard electrophysiology, murray hill, massachusetts, usa).

experimental protocol
after placing the map catheters and achieving complete
av block, cycle length-dependence was ﬁrst investigated
under baseline conditions via pacing the hearts at cycle
lengths between 900 and 300 ms. thereafter, veratridine

antitorsadogenic effect of  xxxd3504xxx 

(0.1 µm) was infused. the experimental setup was
designed to reproduce conditions and circumstances
that are clinically known to be associated with an
increased propensity to the development of tdp [7].
pacing, map recording and measurement of ecg
parameters were repeated after drug infusion. five minutes after lowering potassium concentration to 1.5 mm to
provoke eads and tdp, the potassium concentration
was increased to 5.8 mm again. thereafter  xxxd3504xxx 
(0.75 µm) was infused in addition to continuous veratridine infusion. pacing at increasing cycle lengths and
reduction of potassium concentration were repeated. in
ﬁve control hearts interventricular and transmural dispersion of repolarization were assessed under baseline
conditions and after perfusion of 0.75 µm  xxxd3504xxx ,
without being treated with veratridine before.
dispersion was expressed as the difference between
the minimum and the maximum of map90, simultaneously recorded in eight endocardial and epicardial
catheters. to ensure reproducibility during the study and
to compare the results of different hearts, dispersion was
always measured during the pacing part of the protocol.
interventricular dispersion was deﬁned as the difference
between the mean of ﬁve left and the mean of two right
epicardial map catheters. transmural dispersion was
measured between one left endocardial and the mean of
ﬁve left epicardial map catheters; typically, endocardial
action potential recordings minus the mean of epicardial
action potential recordings. eads were deﬁned as positive voltage deﬂections that interrupted the smooth contour of phase 2 or 3 repolarization of the action potential.
tdp was defined as a polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia of more than 5 beats with a changing ventricular axis and spontaneous termination [4].

data acquisition and statistical analysis
ecg, pressure, volume and maps were recorded on a
multi-channel recorder. data were digitized online at a
rate of 1 khz with 12-bit resolution and stored on a disk.
the observed data were entered onto a computerized
database (microsoft excel 97) and statistically evaluated
using spss software release 11.0.1. (nov. 2001, chicago).
before statistically testing each continuous variable was
analyzed explorative about its normal distribution (“kolmogorov-smirnovtest”). categorical variables are
expressed as frequency and percentage, whereas continuous variables are presented as mean ± sd. differences
were considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. the friedmantest
and the wilcoxontest were used for comparison of nonparametric variables. the inﬂuence of veratridine and
 xxxd3504xxx  on ecg parameters and map duration, as well
as dispersion of repolarization were assessed using the
friedmantest. the wilcoxontest was used to investigate

367

cycle-length dependence. to compare the incidence of
eads and tdp, the chi-squaredtest corrected by the
fisher exact test (fishertest) was used.

results
쮿 effects of veratridine on qt interval, action potential
duration and dispersion of repolarization
all electrocardiographic parameters reached equilibrium within 10 min. after this stabilization period, map
recordings and pacing thresholds (mean threshold 1.7 
1.2 ma) remained highly reproducible throughout the
experimental protocol. the map amplitude did not
change by more than 20% for the subsequent investigation period. veratridine (0.1 µm, n = 8) led to a signiﬁcant increase in qt-interval and map-duration (p <
0.05) thereby mimicking  xxxg2028xxx  (table 1). figure 1 illustrates the effect of veratridine on qt-interval. in the prestable 1 qt-interval and map-duration (map90) after infusion of veratridine (v) and

ence of 0.1 µm veratridine, the increase in qt-interval
prolongation ranged between 2% at 400 ms and 34% at
900 ms demonstrating reverse-frequency dependence. in
bradycardic (av-blocked) hearts, up to eight simultaneous epi- and endocardial maps demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase in dispersion of repolarization in veratridine-treated hearts from baseline values of 43 ms, to
67 ms after drug infusion. to assess regional differences,
the mean values of action potentials recorded from the
left ventricular epicardium were compared to the means

of the right epicardially recorded action potentials and
the endocardial action potential (table 1). there was a
signiﬁcant increase especially in left ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization (fig. 3) (endocardial
action potential recordings minus the mean of epicardial
action potential recordings).

쮿 effects of  xxxd3504xxx  on qt interval, action potential
duration and dispersion of repolarization
when  xxxd3504xxx  (0.75 µm) was administered in the presence of veratridine, no signiﬁcant decrease in qt-interval or epicardial action potential-recordings was observed (table 1, fig. 1; p = ns). remarkably,  xxxd3504xxx  led
to a signiﬁcant decrease of action potential duration in
endocardial cells in veratridine-treated hearts, especially
at slow heart rates. the eight simultaneously recorded
epi- and endocardial maps demonstrated a signiﬁcant
decrease in transmural dispersion from a mean of
+20 ms during veratridine infusion back to baseline
values. in the control group (fig. 3)  xxxd3504xxx  also signiﬁcantly reduced transmural dispersion of repolarization. however, treatment with  xxxd3504xxx  did not
inﬂuence interventricular dispersion of repolarization
(fig. 2) neither in the veratridine group nor in control
hearts.

showed eads. tdp (fig. 4) were always associated with
eads (p < 0.05; fishertest) and occurred in all 6 hearts
which demonstrated eads (53 single episodes).  xxxd3504xxx  (0.75 µm) was found to have an antiarrhythmic
potential. when it was administered in veratridinetreated hearts, none of the 6 hearts with prior eads
showed further episodes of eads.  xxxd3504xxx  led to a
complete elimination of tdp in all veratridine-treated
hearts. moreover, the two hearts without arrhythmias
during veratridine treatment did not develop those in the
presence of  xxxd3504xxx .

discussion
the main ﬁnding of the present study is that  xxxd3504xxx 
suppresses drug-induced tdp in an intact heart model of
 xxxg2028xxx . the suppression of tdp correlates with an inhibition of eads and a  xxxd3504xxx -induced shortening of
endocardial action potential duration leading to a reduction of left transmural dispersion of repolarization.
the use of  xxxd3504xxx  to suppress eads and tdp not
only in acquired but also in congenital lqts has been
reported before, although case reports in the literature
are rare [18, 20, 26]. the pafac trial [10] reported “antitorsadogenic” effects of  xxxd3504xxx  in combination with a
repolarization prolonging drug. liao et al. [20] showed a
highly effective treatment with  xxxd3504xxx  in an unstable
patient with recurrent tdp due to an anticholinergic
overdose. komiya et al. [18] reported a beneﬁcial role of
 xxxd3504xxx  in a patient with a missense mutation in

herg, who suffered from repeated attacks of tdp. our
ﬁndings are in agreement with the results of a previous
study by shimizu et al. [25] in a small group of patients.
they demonstrated a signiﬁcant decrease in dispersion
of repolarization and suppression of eads in patients
with congenital lqts after infusion of  xxxd3504xxx . cosio
et al. [3] treated three patients with tdp in the setting of
atrioventricular block with  xxxd3504xxx . the drug effectively suppressed tdp via suppression of eads without
affecting the qt-interval. jackmann et al. [14] effectively
treated patients with lqts with  xxxd3504xxx  after a betaadrenergic antagonist failed to prevent recurrence of
tdp.
in the present study,  xxxd3504xxx  decreased endocardial
action potential duration with almost no effect on the
epicardium. this effect demonstrated reverse-frequency
dependence, and may thus be of particular role for the
prevention of tdp which are bradycardia dependent
[13]. the distribution of ca currents seems to exhibit
regional differences. wang et al. [31] demonstrated a
larger l-type ca2+ current in endocardial than in epicardial isolated canine myocytes. a larger density of l-type
ca2+ current in endocardial cells might explain the
greater abbreviation of the endocardial action potential
in response to  xxxd3504xxx  leading to reduced transmural
dispersion in the control group and even more in veratridine-treated hearts. as recently reported [23], the
endocardial map-catheter might record endocardial and
m cell potentials simultaneously in the face of a very thin
endocardium tissue in rabbits. the importance of m cells
for the origin of tdp has been reported before. antzelevitch et al. [2] demonstrated a preferential response of m

cells in response to bradycardia and erythromycin as
compared to endocardial and epicardial cells. this may
favor the hypothesis of an increased transmural dispersion of repolarization as a key factor for the occurrence
of tdp [22]. akar et al. [1] also demonstrated the importance of transmural dispersion in the genesis of conduction block and self-sustained intramural reentrant circuits underlying tdp in lqts.
in the present setting, there was a high incidence of
eads in veratridine-treated rabbit hearts at low levels of
extracellular potassium and at slow heart rates. eads
were directly linked to the occurrence of proarrhythmia
and the lack of eads in the presence of  xxxd3504xxx  corresponded to the lack of tdp with this calcium channel
blocker. eads are likely to provide the trigger (i.e., premature ectopic beats) that induce tdp in the presence of
the appropriate substrate (i.e., increased dispersion of
repolarization resulting in electrical heterogeneity with
nonuniform repolarization and refractoriness) for the
initiation and perpetuation of tdp [7]. of note, jackman
et al. [14] reported that calcium antagonists of the  xxxd3504xxx  type inhibited triggered activity while eads persisted. this might be regarded as further evidence for the
importance of reduction of dispersion to prevent tdp.
however, in the present study,  xxxd3504xxx  also suppressed
eads which was previously reported by january et al.
[15] in sheep and canine cardiac purkinje ﬁber short segments.
in  xxxg2028xxx  patients, excess inward current (ina) maintains the plateau at a depolarized level. hondeghem et al.
as well as our own group [12, 21] recently speculated on
the role of action potential prolongation within the ltype ca2+ “window” voltage range, thus permitting calcium channel reactivation, eads and thereby tdp are
likely to be generated [16]. thus, a reasonable explanation for the antiarrhythmic potential of  xxxd3504xxx  might
be that suppression of the l-type ca2+ current [17] leads
not only to a reduction of transmural dispersion via
shortening of endocardial map but also to suppression
of eads [20], by preventing intracellular ca2+-overload

[19].  xxxd3504xxx  produces potent calcium channel block
by acting as an intracellular pore blocker [28], thus
directly interfering with ca movement through the pore.
due to the observed antiarrhythmic mechanisms  xxxd3504xxx  seems to be a therapeutic alternative for treatment and prevention of tdp in  xxxg2028xxx . priori et al. [24]
showed that  xxxd2635xxx  signiﬁcantly reduced qtc prolongation in  xxxg2028xxx  patients. certainly, the effectiveness of
an intervention to abbreviate the qt-interval is not necessarily congruent with its efﬁcacy to reduce the incidence of arrhythmogenesis or risk of sudden death. however, as there is evidence that prolongation of repolarization in  xxxg2028xxx  is associated with an increased dispersion of repolarization (i.e., the substrate) [27] and dispersion of repolarization when preceded by eads (i.e.,
the trigger) results in functional conduction block and
sets the stage for the development of tdp,  xxxd3504xxx  is
likely to be “antitorsadogenic” because it eliminates both
the substrate and the trigger.

conclusion
the present data demonstrated that  xxxd3504xxx  inhibits
tdp in an intact heart model of  xxxg2028xxx . the potential
antiarrhythmic mechanism is due to elimination of the
arrhythmogenic substrate via shortening of endocardial
action potential duration leading to reduction of transmural dispersion of repolarization and due to eliminiaton of the arrhythmogenic trigger via suppression of
eads.  xxxd3504xxx  might be an appropriate therapeutic
option in  xxxg2028xxx . moreover, it may be of additional value
for prevention of tdp in other situations such as
acquired long qt syndrome [10]. further studies in
humans are necessary to conﬁrm the “antitorsadogenic”
beneﬁt of  xxxd3504xxx .
