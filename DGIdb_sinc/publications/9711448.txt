orlistat ( xxxd2792xxx ) is an inhibitor of pancreatic and other lipases. as a  xxxg1789xxx  inhibitor, it acts in the gastrointestinal lumen and is
indicated for use in obesity.
serum total cholesterol and low density lipoproteincholesterol levels were reduced in obese, but otherwise healthy, patients during ≤2 years’ orlistat
treatment; serum triglyceride and high density and
very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels
were unchanged in trials of ≤12 weeks.
obese patients who were maintained on a hypocaloric diet and who received orlistat 360 mg/day
for 12 weeks lost a significantly greater percentage
of bodyweight than placebo recipients (5 vs 3.5%).
in 2-year studies, weight loss was significantly
greater in orlistat than in placebo recipients by the
end of year 1; weight was further reduced or maintained in the second year, when a eucaloric diet was
allowed, in orlistat but not placebo recipients.
a greater proportion of orlistat than placebo recipients lost >5% or >10% of their initial bodyweight
in 1- and 2-year studies.

orlistat

although its aetiology is not well understood,
obesity is becoming more widely accepted as a
chronic disease with genetic and neurological associations rather than a state resulting from a lack
of will power.[1] obesity [body mass index (bmi)
>27.8 kg/m2 for men and >27.3 kg/m2 for women]
is a risk factor associated with other chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and
coronary heart disease;[2] these diseases may require life-long pharmacological intervention.
despite an increased prevalence of obesity in
the us over the last 10 years, very few anti-obesity
agents have been approved by the fda.[3] one reason is that many early drugs used as appetite
suppressants were classified by the drug enforcement agency as schedule ii controlled substances
(i.e. having potential for abuse and dependency).[4]
newer anti-obesity drugs have shown little potential for abuse.[4]
drugs used to treat obesity may be categorised
according to whether they reduce energy intake,
increase energy expenditure, or reduce absorption
of nutrients.[5] orlistat ( xxxd2792xxx ) is a
new orally administered agent which falls into the
last category. it is a partially hydrated derivative of
endogenous  xxxd2792xxx  produced by streptomyces
toxytricini.[6,7] the drug is a specific and long-acting inhibitor of lipases,[6,8] and pharmacokinetic
studies suggest its effects are restricted to the gastrointestinal tract,[9] where it prevents the lipasecatalysed breakdown and subsequent absorption of
about one-third of dietary ingested fats.

• in vitro, the half maximal inhibition of lipase
activity was effected by similar concentrations of
orlistat in mice (0.27 mg/l), pigs (0.11 mg/l) and
humans (0.12 mg/l).[8] the respective median inhibitory concentration (ic50) values for orlistat and
 xxxd2792xxx , its parent compound, for in vitro porcine
 xxxg1789xxx  inhibition of trioleate were 0.36
and 0.14 mumol/l.[7]
• in normal healthy volunteers consuming 60
g/day of fat, orlistat 360 mg/day recipients (n = 5)
excreted 21.5 g/day more faecal fat than placebo
recipients (n = 3) [bmi and duration of treatment
not reported]. increasing the dosage of orlistat
from 360 to 600 mg/day did not significantly increase the efficacy of the drug as assessed by the
amount of fat excreted in the faeces.[10] furthermore, with orlistat 600 mg/day, increasing the
amount of dietary fat from 60 to 76 g/day increased
the absolute amount, but not the percentage, of faecal fat excreted. approximately 32% of ingested fat
was lost in the faeces of orlistat recipients and 4.4%
in placebo recipients.
• dietary fibre content (28 vs 10 g/day) did not
influence faecal fat excretion after orlistat 80mg 3
times daily in healthy male volunteers.[11]
• over an 8-day period, the effect of orlistat 80mg
3 times daily on faecal fat excretion was not influenced by administration time relative to meals: the
agent was given to 24 healthy volunteers mid-meal
or 1 or 2 hours after the meal.[12]
• in a clinical trial, 173 non-obese patients with
primary hyperlipidaemia were given orlistat 30 to
360 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks. figure 1 illustrates the effects of orlistat 360 mg/day or placebo
on a range of serum lipid and lipoprotein levels. in
orlistat ≥90 mg/day recipients decreases of approximately 6 to 10% were seen in some serum cholesterol levels [p ≤ 0.002 for total cholesterol and p ≤
0.02 for low density lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol,
both vs baseline];[13] corresponding increases of
1% each were seen in placebo recipients. baseline
values were measured after a 6-week placebo runin period.

serum total cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol
levels returned to within 2% of baseline values at
the end of a 2-week placebo follow-up period in all
patients. levels of serum triglycerides were essentially unchanged from baseline levels after 8
weeks’ orlistat treatment, however, an approximate
12% increase in serum triglyceride levels was observed in the placebo group (p < 0.05 vs baseline).
very low density lipoprotein (vldl)-cholesterol
and high density lipoprotein (hdl)-cholesterol
levels were decreased by 12 and 8% after 8 weeks’
orlistat 360 mg/day therapy (p < 0.05 vs baseline
for vldl-cholesterol). in addition, orlistat 30 to
360 mg/day, but not placebo, decreased the levels
of  xxxg173xxx  and b from baseline by about
3 to 10% (p < 0.05).
• fasting and postprandial plasma lipid levels
were altered after 8 weeks’ orlistat administration
(30 to 360 mg/day) in non-obese patients with
hyperlipidaemia.[14] patients were maintained on a

tively, 7.7, 8.9 and 9.8% (p ≤ 0.006) in orlistat recipients. however, in the placebo group, plasma
and ldl-cholesterol levels were not significantly
altered. postprandial plasma triglyceride levels
were measured after 8 weeks of orlistat administration and 2 weeks later after a placebo follow-up
period. after a fat load [cream (40%  xxxd3230xxx ;
50 g/m2 body surface) plus 120 000iu aqueous
retinyl palmitate] postprandial triglyceridaemia
decreased by 27% during orlistat administration
compared with the follow-up period (p = 0.04), but
was not significantly altered in placebo recipients.
• 186 obese, but otherwise healthy, patients (bmi
27.3 to 35 kg/m2) received placebo, or orlistat 30,
180 or 360 mg/day, for up to 12 weeks. compared
with baseline, the respective changes in serum total
cholesterol levels were +0.22, +0.10, –0.10 (p =

• in several 2-year studies in obese, but otherwise
healthy patients (n = 688 to 892), total cholesterol
and ldl-cholesterol levels were reported to be
lower in orlistat 180 to 360 mg/day recipients than
in placebo recipients by the end of the first year (p
< 0.05,[16] no p-value provided[17]); in 1 study reductions were 6.5 and 9.7% for total and ldl-cholesterol levels (p < 0.002 vs placebo).[18] reduced
cholesterol levels were maintained for the duration
of the study. furthermore, patients who were
switched from placebo to orlistat treatment at the
end of the first year had an immediate onset and
sustained decrease in total and ldl-cholesterol
levels (by 6.1 and 7.9% at the end of year 2).[17]
conversely, corresponding increases of 5.2 and
8.6% occurred in patients who were switched from
orlistat to placebo during the second year.
similar decreases in baseline levels of ldlcholesterol were observed during the 4-week runin period in patients receiving orlistat (3.1%) or
placebo (4.1%); a further 7.5% decrease and a 4.9%
increase occurred, respectively, in orlistat and placebo recipients after 2 years’ continued therapy.[17]
• in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
(non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), mean
hba1c (predominant glycosylated haemoglobin;
an indicator of hyperglycaemia) levels decreased
from about 8% to 7.5% during a 2-week run-in period in both orlistat (120mg 3 times daily; n = 163)
and placebo (n = 159) recipients. after 1 year, mean
hba1c levels decreased by 0.2% and increased by
0.3%, respectively, in orlistat and placebo recipients (p < 0.0002). in addition, mean ldl-cholesterol levels, which decreased by 61 mg/l in both
groups during the run-in period, were further decreased by 46 mg/l in orlistat recipients and increased by 82 mg/l in placebo recipients during
treatment. furthermore, in patients with an initial
ldl-cholesterol level >1300 mg/l, those receiving orlistat had a mean decrease of 140 mg/l compared with a mean increase of 20 mg/l in patients
receiving placebo. these results suggest that orlistat may help improve glycaemic control and dyslipidaemia in obese patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus.

• there was no significant difference in plasma
thyroid hormone levels in 14 moderately obese, but
otherwise healthy, patients who received either 12
weeks’ orlistat 360 mg/day or placebo.[19]
• in 6 healthy volunteers, neither gallbladder motility nor release of cholecystokinin was altered by
a single 200mg dose of orlistat.[20]
2. pharmacokinetic profile
• in an overview of phase i single-dose studies in
healthy volunteers or obese patients (n = 6 to 12),[9]
plasma orlistat concentrations, measured over a period of 1.5 to 69 hours after administration of 50 to
800mg of the drug, were <5 mug/l (the assay limit
of detection). in multiple-dose studies (orlistat 25
to 400mg 3 times daily for 5 to 23 days), plasma
drug concentrations, measured up to 96 hours after
initial orlistat administration, were similar to those
seen after single-dose studies. however, in 1 study
(n = 6 obese volunteers; orlistat 1200 mg/day for
10 days) 3 plasma orlistat concentrations of >4
mug/l and <50 mug/l were reported.
• in 2 similar studies, healthy male volunteers (n
= 6 and 8) received single-dose [14c]orlistat 50 or
350mg.[9] maximum plasma radioactivity levels
were measured  xxxd2274xxx .5 or 8.2 hours after administration. however, plasma orlistat concentrations were
below the limit of detection (i.e. <5 mug/l) throughout both studies. although 4 and 1.5% of the total
radioactivity was recovered in the urine no intact
orlistat was detected. the remainder of the total
radioactivity was recovered in the faeces within 4
days’ administration of radiolabelled drug; up to
83% of this was attributable to intact orlistat. these
data suggest limited systemic absorption and metabolism of the agent. elimination half-life values
of 14 to 19 hours were reported for orlistat.
effects of orlistat on the pharmacokinetics
of other drugs

• in a number of crossover studies in healthy volunteers (n = 12 to 18), the pharmacokinetic profiles
of single-dose digoxin (0.4mg),[21] nifedipine sustained release (60mg),[22] phenytoin (300mg)[23] or

orlistat: new drug profile

 xxxd2215xxx  (5mg)[24] were not significantly altered
when these drugs were given concomitantly with
orlistat 240 to 360 mg/day for 6 to 16 days. the
time to maximum plasma concentration for rwarfarin (given as 30mg racemic  xxxd3535xxx )
was greater in the presence of orlistat than with
placebo (3.5 vs 2.5 hours); all other pharmacodynamic parameters of warfarin measured in the
study were similar in placebo and orlistat recipients.[25]
• in healthy volunteers (n = 6 to 8 per group), the
pharmacokinetic profiles of a number of antihypertensive agents including atenolol (100mg), furosemide (40mg), nifedipine (20mg) and captopril
(50mg), given as single doses, were not clinically
significantly altered by concomitant administration of orlistat (150 mg/day).[26]
• in 10 healthy women, orlistat 360 mg/day did
not influence the action of oral contraceptives.[27]
effects of orlistat on the pharmacokinetics
of dietary supplements

orlistat inhibits the absorption of ingested fats.
it is possible, therefore, that endogenous levels of
fat-soluble vitamins may become depleted with
prolonged use of the agent.
• orlistat 360 mg/day for 9 days, compared with
placebo, decreased the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the concentration-time
curve values of oral  xxxd3521xxx  acetate supplementation (400iu given on day 4 of orlistat administration) by 43 and 60%, respectively. this suggests
that short term administration of orlistat may compromise  xxxd3521xxx  absorption from the gut. conversely, the pharmacokinetic profile of oral  xxxd3105xxx  acetate supplementation (25 000iu given on
day 4 of orlistat administration) was not significantly affected.[28]
• small, clinically insignificant decreases in serum levels of vitamins a and d were seen in obese
patients after 12 weeks’ treatment with placebo or
orlistat 30 to 360 mg/day:[15]  xxxd3105xxx  levels decreased by 0.034 mumol/l in the placebo group and
by between 0.004 and 0.095 mumol/l in the orlistat

group; the corresponding reductions in vitamin d
levels were 15.4 nmol/l and between 12.1 and 23.3
nmol/l. the reduction in vitamin d levels observed in both placebo and orlistat groups was attributed to seasonal change (from autumn to winter).  xxxd3521xxx  levels were significantly reduced
with orlistat 180 and 360 mg/day (by 3.16 and 3.48
mumol/l) and increased with placebo (by 0.81
mumol/l; all p < 0.01).
• approximately 60% of a supplemental dose of
beta-carotene, a major dietary source of  xxxd3105xxx ,
was absorbed when a single 30 to 120mg dose was
given (on day 4) to 12 healthy volunteers receiving
orlistat 360 mg/day.[29] this may be sufficient to
achieve physiological levels of beta-carotene in obese
patients who may develop reduced levels of the
agent during orlistat therapy.
• meta-analysis of obese patients who received
orlistat 360 mg/day (n = 2038) or placebo (n =
1740) for up to 2 years, revealed that plasma levels
of vitamins d and e and beta-carotene were significantly reduced in orlistat compared with placebo
recipients; the levels, however, remained within
the normal clinical range (no further details provided).[30]
3. therapeutic trials
in the studies reviewed, patients were obese,
but healthy unless stated otherwise. the trials followed a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. in studies of ≤1 year in duration,
patients received a mildly hypocaloric diet (500 to
800 kcal/day deficit, typically, with 30% of calories from fat) in conjunction with study medication; a eucaloric diet was allowed in the second
year of the 2-year studies.
• 135 obese patients (bmi 27.3 to 35 kg/m2) completed a 12-week study in which they received placebo or orlistat 30 to 360 mg/day.[15] during a 4week run-in period, on placebo and a reduced
calorie intake, weight loss was similar in all patients. after 12 weeks’ therapy, however, weight
loss was 3.5, 3.9, 4.1 and 5%, respectively, for pladrugs 1998 aug; 56 (2)

weight regain was less in patients who received
2 years’ orlistat treatment (26% regain of weight
lost) than those receiving placebo for 2 years

and the agent was administered 2 hours before food
(i.e. with little or no fat content in the stomach).

weeks’ therapy. furthermore, in long term studies,
an 8 to 27% incidence of gastrointestinal adverse
events reported by orlistat recipients in the first
year decreased by between 6 and 22% during the

adverse events (no further details provided).

up surveys, 11 cases of breast cancer were observed in women aged ≥45 years who received orlistat 120mg 3 times daily for up to 2 years compared with 3 cases with placebo. a concern
regarding this imbalance was dismissed after reevaluation of pre-existing clinical data and followup examinations.[33]

the tumours were assessed with respect to size,
histological features and the presence of carcinoma
and/or lymph node metastases.
• seven independent experts (in the fields of histopathology, mammography and oncology) unanimously agreed that of these cases, 8 existed before
study initiation and 1 case was a carcinoma in situ.
the experts concluded that 3 and 2 cases, in the
orlistat 120mg and placebo groups, respectively,
were ‘possibly emerging after treatment initiation’.[33] thus there was no difference in the incidence of breast cancer between orlistat and placebo
recipients (0.4 and 0.35% of the ≥45 year-old population; no cases were found in women aged <45
years).
• furthermore, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity
animal studies showed no evidence that orlistat
could initiate or stimulate the growth of mammary
or other tumours.[33] systemic exposure to the drug
in these studies was many times greater than that
in humans.
• thus, there is no evidence for a causal or stimulatory association between orlistat and breast cancer.[33]
5. orlistat: current status
orlistat is a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor that
is launched or approved in >15 countries in europe,
south america and southeast asia/pacific. the
drug was well tolerated when administered to
obese patients for up to 2 years and resulted in a
significant weight loss when given at a dosage of
120mg 3 times daily.
