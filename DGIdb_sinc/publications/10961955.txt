the elusive link between  xxxg2028xxx  and brugada syndrome: the role of  xxxd2113xxx  challenge.  defects of the  xxxg2028xxx  gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel are associated with both the  xxxg2028xxx  subtype of long-qt syndrome and brugada syndrome (bs). the typical manifestations of long-qt syndrome (qt interval prolongation) and bs (st segment elevation in leads v1 through v3) may coexist in the same patients, which raises questions about the actual differences between  xxxg2028xxx  and bs. intravenous  xxxd2113xxx  is the standard provocative test used to unmask bs in individuals with concealed forms of the disease, and oral  xxxd2113xxx  has been proposed as a treatment option for  xxxg2028xxx  patients because it may shorten their qt interval.
