abstract
the organophosphorus (op) pesticide malathion is a highly neurotoxic compound. although some studies have reported neurotoxicity signs
after the in utero exposure to op pesticides, there is no evidence of the exclusive contribution of the lactational exposure to malathion as a possible
cause of neurotoxicity in the offspring. in this study, we investigated the exclusive contribution of malathion exposure through maternal milk on the
activity of acetylcholinesterase (ache), as well as on biochemical parameters related to the oxidative stress (glutathione levels, lipid peroxidation
and  xxxg981xxx  and glutathione peroxidase activities) in the brain of suckling mice. the same parameters were also evaluated in the
brains of the respective mothers, which where directly exposed to malathion during the lactational period (daily s.c. injections; doses of 20, 60 and
200 mg/kg of body weight). our results showed that the lactational exposure to malathion caused a high inhibitory effect of the brain ache activity
in the offspring, even when dams were exposed to the lowest malathion dose (20 mg/kg). brain ache activity was also inhibited in mothers;
however, only at the highest malathion dose (200 mg/kg). no changes were observed in the biochemical parameters related to the oxidative stress
for both dams and pups brains. the present study shows, for the first time, that the exposure of neonatal mice to malathion via lactation inhibits the
activity of brain ache in the offspring. these data, summed to the fact that op pesticides are excreted in human milk, makes relevant the
lactational exposure to these xenobiotics in terms of human health concerns.

1. introduction
the op pesticide malathion (o,o-dimethyl-s-1,2-bis ethoxy
carbonyl ethyl phosphorodithioate), like other op compounds,
is known to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (ache) activity, an
effect that is thought to underlie the neurotoxicity elicited by
these compounds (kwong, 2002). in this regard, studies have
reported neurotoxic effects of malathion exposure in both
humans (komori et al., 1991; vidair, 2004) and experimental
animals (abdel-rahman et al., 2004; brocardo et al., 2005).
although neurotoxicity signs have been reported after the in
utero exposure to some op pesticides (chanda et al., 1995),
there is no evidence of the exclusive contribution of the
lactational exposure to malathion as a possible cause of
neurotoxicity in the offspring. in this regard, it is noteworthy
that many op pesticides can be excreted in milk (salas et al.,

2003; battu et al., 2004). in addition, it has been reported the
presence of op pesticides, including malathion, in human milk
(sanghi et al., 2003), showing the relevance of the present issue
in terms of human health concerns.
in addition to the inhibition of ache activity, op-induced
toxicity is also related to the pro-oxidative properties of these
compounds (banerjee et al., 1999; verma and srivastava, 2001;
ranjbar et al., 2002). of particular significance, malathion
exposure increases lipid peroxidation in rodent erythrocytes,
liver and brain (hazarika et al., 2003; akhgari et al., 2003).
other studies indicate that antioxidant enzyme activities were
increased, reduced or not changed in the liver, brain and
erythrocytes of animals treated with this compound (srikanth
and seth, 1990; pedrajas et al., 1995; ahmed et al., 2000; john
et al., 2001; akhgari et al., 2003; hazarika et al., 2003). the
differences found may be due, e.g. to the malathion exposure
regime employed (brocardo et al., 2005).
even though the beneficial effects of maternal milk to
offspring are evident (kunz et al., 1999; oddy, 2000), it seems

1102

a.p. silva et al. / neurotoxicology 27 (2006) 1101–1105

reasonable and necessary to perform the correct evaluation of
the contribution of the exclusive lactational exposure to op
pesticides as possible cause of neurotoxicity. taking into
account the absence of studies showing the real contribution of
the lactational exposure to malathion toward the development
of neurotoxicity in the offspring, and the relationship between
the pro-oxidative properties of the op pesticide malathion and
its toxic effects, this study was aimed to investigate the
neurotoxic effects of the exclusive lactational exposure to
malathion in suckling mice. the activity of ache, as well as
biochemical parameters related to the oxidative stress, were
analyzed in mice brain. these variables were evaluated in the
weaning mice and dams in an attempt to detect possible
differences of susceptibility to malathion-induced neurotoxicity between mature and developing brain.

bedding. thus, the exclusive and significant way of offspring
exposure to malathion was through maternal milk. all
experiments were conducted in accordance with the guiding
principles in the use of animals in toxicology, adopted by the
society of toxicology in july 1989.
2.4. tissue preparation
twenty-four hours after the last injection, two randomly
selected weaning mice, and their respective mothers, were
killed by decapitation. gender effects were not considered
important in selecting pups for analysis, pups of both sexes
were used. brains were homogenized (1:5 w/v) in hepes
25 mm, ph 7.4 buffer and the tissue homogenates were rapidly
centrifuged at 20,000  g, at 4 8c for 30 min. the supernatants
obtained were used for the determinations of enzymatic
activities, as well as for the quantifications of the levels of
glutathione and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
(tbars).

commercial-grade malathion (o,o-dimethyl-s-1,2-bis
ethoxy carbonyl ethyl phosphorodithioate, 95% purity, cas
 xxxd2535xxx ) was purchased from dipil chemical ind. (brazil). bnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate sodium salt
reduced form, 5-50 -dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid, glutathione
reductase from baker’s yeast, and  xxxd2213xxx  were
obtained from sigma (st. louis, mo, usa). all other
chemicals were of the highest grade available commercially.

2.5. determination of acetylcholinesterase activity

2.2. animals

2.6. antioxidant enzyme assays

adult swiss albino mice (male and female), 90 days old,
from our own breeding colony were maintained at 25 8c, on a
12 h light cycle:12 h dark cycle, with free access to food
(nuvital, pr, brazil) and water. the breeding regimen
consisted of grouping three virgin females with one male for
5 days. pregnant mice were selected and housed individually in
opaque plastic cages.

glutathione peroxidase (gpx) activity was measured by
the wendel (1981) method, using tert-butylhydroperoxide as
a substrate. nadph disappearance was monitored by a
spectrophotometer at 340 nm.  xxxg981xxx  (gr)
activity was determined by the method described by carlberg
and mannervik (1985). the reduction of  xxxd2811xxx  in the
presence of nadph was measured spectrophotometrically at
340 nm.

brain acetylcholinesterase activity was estimated by the
method of ellman et al. (1961), using acetylthiocholine iodide
as a substrate. the rate of hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide
is measured at 412 nm through the release of the thiol
compound which, when reacted with dtnb, produces the
color-forming compound tnb.

2.3. treatment
2.7. glutathione levels and lipid peroxidation
in the first day after parturition (postnatal day 1), 20 dams
were randomly assigned to one of the four groups (control,
malathion 20 mg/kg,  xxxd2535xxx  mg/kg and malathion
200 mg/kg) of five animals each. pups (eight per litter) were
maintained with their mothers, which were exposed to
malathion (daily s.c. injections; doses of 20, 60 and 200 mg/
kg) during the lactational period, postnatal day 1 to postnatal
day 21. commercial-grade malathion solution was dissolved in
physiological saline (150 mm nacl) and its dose was based on
the study of brocardo et al. (2005). mothers from control group
received daily injections of physiological saline (10 ml/kg).
since malathion and its metabolites are excreted mainly in
urine (bouchard et al., 2003), the possibility of dermal and oral
transference of malathion from dams to pups was considered
unimportant. anyway, animals’ cages were cleaned daily to
minimize the contact of pups with potential contaminated

glutathione was measured as nonprotein thiols based on
ellman (1959) minor modifications (farina et al., 2003). lipid
peroxidation was measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances (tbars) based on ohkawa et al. (1979).
2.8. determination of protein
the protein content was quantified by the method of
bradford (1976), using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
2.9. statistical analysis
differences between groups were evaluated by one-way
anova, followed by duncan’s multiple range tests when
appropriate.

were observed in these parameters for both dams and pups

3. results
fig. 1 depicts the activity of brain acetylcholinesterase in
lactating mice exposed to malathion, as well as in their
respective offspring. malathion exposure caused a significant
inhibition of ache activity in the brain of mothers; however,
only at the highest malathion dose (200 mg/kg). brain ache
activity was also inhibited in weaning mice lactationally
exposed to malathion. it is noteworthy that this inhibitory effect
observed even when mothers were directly exposed to the
lowest malathion dose (20 mg/kg). in addition, the effect of the
lactational exposure to malathion on brain ache activity was
dose-dependent. in fact, a significant pearson correlation was
evidenced for malathion dose  brain ache activity in the
weaning mice (pearson’s coefficient = 0.499; p = 0.006).
even though the inhibitory effect of malathion on maternal
brain ache activity was observed only at the highest malathion
dose, a significant pearson correlation was also evidenced for
malathion dose  brain ache activity in the dams (pearson’s
coefficient = 0.616; p = 0.019).
the effects of malathion exposure on brain glutathione
peroxidase and  xxxg981xxx  activities, lipid peroxidation and glutathione levels are depicted in table 1. no changes

there are studies showing that perinatal exposure to op
pesticides cause neurotoxicity in animals (chanda et al., 1995;
slotkin et al., 2005). on the other hand, it has been reported that
op pesticides can be excreted in milk (salas et al., 2003; sanghi
et al., 2003; battu et al., 2004). however, to the best of our
knowledge, there are no data in the literature showing
lactational exposure to malathion as cause of neurotoxicity
in the offspring. the results of our study confirm the incidence
of neurotoxicity (inhibition of brain ache) as consequence of
the exclusive lactational malathion exposure in suckling mice.
from a toxicological point of view, this result represents an
important finding because they show, for the first time, that the
exposure of mothers to malathion during the lactational period
can, per se, cause neurotoxic effects in the offspring, without
the need of previous in utero intoxication.
in the recent years, a growing body of evidence indicates the
high vulnerability of pregnant/lactating women concerning
pesticide exposures (hill et al., 1995; whyatt et al., 2002;
berkowitz et al., 2003), with several studies suggesting that
resident farm families and farm workers have higher exposures
than do other populations (simcox et al., 1999; mccauley et al.,
2001; curl et al., 2002; fenske et al., 2002). these evidences,
summed to our experimental data, which confirm the
occurrence of neurotoxicity after the lactational exposure to
an op pesticide, make clear the need for attention of pregnant
women on op exposure not only during pregnancy, but also
during lactational period. in particular, it is well known that the
inhibition of the brain ache by op pesticides leads to the
accumulation of acetylcholine in the synapses that, in turn,
induces hyperactivity of cholinergic pathways. since acetylcholine plays important trophic roles in brain development,
one could assume that op pesticides exposure during the
developmental period can interfere with neurotransmitter
function leading to neurodevelopmental abnormalities by
disrupting the timing or intensity of neurotrophic actions
(slotkin, 2004a). on the other hand, it is noteworthy that op
pesticides have direct effects on cellular processes that are
unique to brain development, and that these effects are

mechanistically unrelated to inhibition of cholinesterase
(slotkin, 2004b).
another important finding from our study is that the
inhibitory effect of malathion on brain ache activity was
higher in weaning mice when compared to their respective
mothers. in fact, even though dams were directly exposed to
subcutaneous injections of malathion, only the highest dose
(200 mg/kg) caused brain ache inhibition. conversely, in the
suckling mice lactationally exposed to malathion, this
inhibitory effect was observed even though mothers were
exposed to the lowest malathion dose (20 mg/kg). why the
immature brain displays higher sensitivity to op pesticides
relative to the adult is not completely solved. however,
evidence show that developing organisms recover more quickly
from cholinesterase inhibition than do comparably exposed
adults, largely due to the rapid synthesis of new cholinesterase
molecules (pope and chakraborti, 1992; pope et al., 1991; song
et al., 1997). based on this evidence, one could suppose even
higher inhibitory effects of brain ache in suckling mice during
treatment period at least for a brief time interval.
oxidative stress has been postulated to represent a
noncholinergic mechanism by which op pesticides cause
neurotoxicity (abou-donia, 2003; brocardo et al., 2005). we
were unable to find evidence of significant effects of malathion
exposure on biochemical parameters related to oxidative stress
in mice brain from either mothers or weaning animals. based
on our findings, one could ask if the sensitivities of the assays
used were sufficient to detect biochemical relevant changes. in
this regard, recent studies of our group have showed that the
exclusive lactational exposure to methylmercury, a well known
neurotoxicant, changed biochemical variables related to
oxidative stress in weaning mice cerebellum (manfroi et al.,
2004; franco et al., 2006). in addition, brocardo et al. (2005)
showed increased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances and decreased  xxxg981xxx  activity in
rat cerebral cortex after acute exposure to malathion. since the
biochemical protocols used in this study were exactly the same
of those used in our previous studies (manfroi et al., 2004;
franco et al., 2006) and in the study of brocardo et al. (2005),
the negative findings of malathion effects on oxidative stressrelated parameters can not be linked to low sensitivities of the
used assays. the relationship between oxidative stress and op
pesticides-induced toxicity is still unsolved: there are several
contradictory studies (srikanth and seth, 1990; pedrajas et al.,
1995; ahmed et al., 2000; john et al., 2001; akhgari et al.,
2003; hazarika et al., 2003). divergent results may be related to
different op pesticide compounds and exposure regime
employed, which refer mainly to different doses, different
times of chronic administration and different ages of the
animals at the time of exposure.
concluding, the present study shows, for the first time, that
the exposure of lactating mice to malathion inhibits the activity
of brain ache in the offspring. these data are extremely
important because the inhibition of the brain ache causes
cholinergic hyperactivity, which may disrupt neurotrophic
actions during development. taking into account that op
pesticides – including malathion – are excreted in human milk,

the presented results become relevant in terms of human health
concerns.
