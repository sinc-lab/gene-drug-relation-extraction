abstract
we characterized the alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes in hamster ureters according to gene and protein expressions and contractile function. realtime quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to determine mrna levels
and receptor protein expressions respectively, for alpha1a-, alpha1b- and alpha1d-adrenoceptors in hamster ureteral smooth muscle. alpha1-adrenoceptor
antagonists were tested against the phenylephrine (alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist)-induced contraction in isolated hamster ureteral preparations using a
functional experimental approach. in the smooth muscle, relative mrna expression levels for alpha1a-, alpha1b- and alpha1d-adrenoceptors were 10.7%, 1.2%
and 88.1%, respectively, and protein expressions were identified for alpha1a- and alpha1d-adrenoceptors immunohistochemically. noradrenaline and
phenylephrine (alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist) each produced a concentration-dependent tonic contraction, their pd2 values being 6.87 ± 0.08 and 6.10 ±
0.05, respectively.  xxxd3000xxx  (nonselective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist),  xxxd3202xxx  (selective  xxxg85xxx  antagonist) and bmy-7378 (8-[2-[4(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione dihydrochloride) (selective  xxxg87xxx  antagonist) competitively
antagonized the phenylephrine-induced contraction (pa2 values, 8.60 ± 0.07, 9.44 ± 0.06 and 5.75 ± 0.07, respectively). chloroethylclonidine
(3 × 10− 6 mol/l or more) produced a rightward shift in the concentration–response curve for phenylephrine. thus, in hamster ureters, alpha1a- and
alpha1d-adrenoceptors were more prevalent than the  xxxg86xxx , with contraction being mediated mainly via alpha1a-adrenoceptors. if these
findings hold true for humans,  xxxg85xxx  antagonists could become useful medication for stone passage in urolithiasis patients.

1. introduction
the autonomic nervous system is known to play an important
role in modulating ureteral motility (schulman, 1974). sympathetic nerves modulate contractions via alpha-adrenoceptors and
relaxations via beta-adrenoceptors (dean, 1967). the alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine increases contractility in the isolated
ureter and elevates ureteral pressure in anaesthetized animals
(wanajo et al., 2005; tomiyama et al., 2002). three types of alpha1adrenoceptor mrnas (alpha1a-, alpha1b-, alpha1d-) reportedly exist in human
ureteral smooth muscle (sigala et al., 2005) and it has recently
been shown that alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists promote ureteral
stone passage in urolithiasis patients (yilmaz et al., 2005;
hollingsworth et al., 2006). however, there is no published

information concerning the alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes predominantly mediating ureteral contractions.
in this study, we attempted to: 1) quantify the mrna level and
protein expression for each alpha1-adrenoceptor subtype and 2)
characterize the functional alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating
contraction in hamster isolated ureters by comparing the potencies
with which subtype-selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists altered
the concentration–response curve for phenylephrine.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
this study was conducted according to guidelines approved by
the laboratory animal committee of kissei pharmaceutical and
it conformed to current japanese law. male syrian hamsters
(68.2–96.3 g; nihon slc, hamamatsu, japan) were maintained

202

under a 12-h light-dark cycle with free access to water and
standard laboratory food until the day of the experiment.
2.2. isolation of ureters
hamsters were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg i.p.),
then killed with an overdose of the same agent. ureters were
carefully dissected free from the surrounding fatty tissues and
fibrous tissues.
2.3. real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (rt-pcr)
total rna was isolated from the above tissues using isogen
(nippon gene, tokyo, japan) with dnase i treatment. primers for
the partial cloning of hamster alpha1-adrenoceptor cdna were
designed on the basis of the sequences for hamster alpha1badrenoceptor (ncbi accession no. j04084), rat  xxxg85xxx 
(ncbi accession no. nm_017191) and rat  xxxg87xxx 
(ncbi accession no. nm_024483) using primer express 2.0
(table 1; applied biosystems, foster city, ca). pcr was
performed with the aid of accuprime taq dna polymerase
high fidelity (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) using cdna for hamster
heart and aorta. partial hamster alpha1-adrenoceptor coding sequences
were cloned from hamster heart and aorta and inserted in the tacloning site of the pcr-topo vector. the mrna expression
levels corresponding to a couple of target genes were determined
by real-time quantitative rt-pcr in a geneamp 5700 sequence
detection system (applied biosystems), using taqman reverse
transcription reagents and taqman universal pcr master mix
(applied biosystems). primers and fam/tamra double-dye
probes for hamster alpha1-adrenoceptors were designed using primer
express 2.0 (table 1; applied biosystems) on the basis of the
cloned partial hamster alpha1-adrenoceptors coding sequences mentioned above. gene expressions were calculated by interpolation of
the threshold cycle-number values on standard curves generated
from dilutions of the plasmid dnas containing hamster alpha1a-, alpha1band  xxxg87xxx , rt-pcr was performed in duplicate. data
were normalized to the amounts of 18s ribosomal rna present in
each specimen (predeveloped taqman assay reagents; applied
biosystems). all procedures were carried out according to the
manufacturer's instructions unless otherwise specified.

2.4. immunohistochemistry
ureters were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde at ph 7.2, then embedded in paraffin. immunostaining of
cross-sections (4 mum thick) was performed using the catalyzed
signal amplification system (csa; dako, copenhagen, denmark) with some modifications. briefly, sections were deparaffinised using 1 mm tris solution (ph 9.0) supplemented with
0.5 mm egta, and then heated in a microwave oven for 45 min
for antigen retrieval. after cooling and washing in water,
endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% h2o2 for 5 min,
before nonspecific binding of immunoglobulin was blocked by
protein block reagent (dako) for 15 min. after overnight
incubation at 4 °c with anti-alpha1-adrenoceptor subtype-selective
primary antibodies (alpha1a: sc-31359, alpha1b: sc-1476, alpha1d: sc-1475;
santa cruz biotechnology, ca) at 1:500 dilution, sections were
rinsed with tris-buffered saline containing tween20 (tbst) 3
times for 5 min each. then, sections were treated with biotinylated
second antibody (anti-goat igg; dako) for 15 min at room
temperature. after rinsing with tbst 3 times for 5 min each,
sections were treated with streptavidin-peroxidase complex for
15 min. for signal amplification, sections were treated with
streptavidin-peroxidase for 15 min after a 15-min incubation with
biotinyl-tyramide reagent (dako), before signals were finally
revealed using 3, 3′-diaminobenzide tetrahydrochloride (dab;
dojindo, kumamoto, japan) as the substrate chromogen.
following counterstaining with mayer's haematoxylin solution
(sigma, st. louis, mo) for 2 min, sections were rinsed under
running water for 15 min, then mounted in mount-quick (daido
sangyo, tokyo, japan). goat serum served as the negative control,
being used instead of the primary antibody. detection of the
various alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes was achieved by microscopy
(mcd-350; olympus, tokyo, japan) at 200 times magnification.
2.5. functional experiment
first, ureters were made into tubular preparations (20 mm
each). for a given experiment, one of these segments was
suspended longitudinally in a 10 ml organ bath containing
krebs solution (composition in mm: nacl 118.1, kcl 4.7,
cacl2 2.5,  xxxd2534xxx  7h2o 1.2, nahco3 25.0, kh2po4 1.2,
glucose 11.1). this was maintained at 37 °c and continuously
gassed with a mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide.
the tissue's response to various maneuvers was assessed by
means of an isometric force-transducer and measuring system
(tb-611t, ap-601g and rpm-6004; nihon kohden, tokyo,
japan) connected to a polygraph (recti-horiz-8k; ge marquette medical systems japan, tokyo, japan). an initial resting
tension of 1 mn was placed on each segment and it was allowed
to equilibrate for 1 h. alpha1-adrenoceptor agonists were cumulatively added in 0.5-log increments. in competition experiments,
each tissue was equilibrated with one of the alpha1-adrenoceptor
antagonists for 1 h before the addition of phenylephrine, with the
phenylephrine-induced contractions being expressed as a
percentage of the maximal response achieved in each preparation. each preparation was exposed to only one antagonist and/
or one agonist.

2.6. drugs
 xxxd3202xxx  was synthesized in our laboratory (kissei pharmaceutical, azumino, japan). phenylephrine, noradrenaline,
 xxxd3000xxx , chloroethylclonidine and bmy-7378 were obtained
from sigma, dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso) from nacalai tesque
(kyoto, japan) and sodium pentobarbital from dainippon
pharmaceutical (osaka, japan).  xxxd3202xxx  and  xxxd3000xxx  were
dissolved in 100% dmso, the other drugs in distilled water. at
the concentration reached in the bath (0.1%), dmso had no
effect on our preparations. we used  xxxd3000xxx  as a nonselective
alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist,  xxxd3202xxx  (kmd-3213: 1-(3-hydroxypropyl)-5-[(2r)-2-({2-[2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-phenoxy]
ethyl}amino)propyl]-2,3-dihydro-1h-indole-7-carboxamide) as
an  xxxg85xxx  antagonist (tatemichi et al., 2006),
chloroethylclonidine as an  xxxg86xxx  antagonist (eltze,
1996) and bmy-7378 (8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione dihydrochloride) as
an  xxxg87xxx  antagonist (marti et al., 2005).
2.7. data analysis
all results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the
mean (s.e.m.). the pd2 value was obtained by taking the
negative logarithm of the molar ec50 value. the pa2 value for
each antagonist, as defined by arunlakshana and schild (1959),
was obtained from the x-axis intercept of a linear regression
plot of log (cr-1) versus the negative logarithm of the

antagonist concentration (cr being the concentration ratio of
the agonist in the presence or absence of antagonist). statistical
differences between the slope value obtained from the schild
plot and unity were assessed using a student's t-test at the 5%
level of significance.
3. results
3.1. quantitative rt-pcr of alpha1-adrenoceptor mrna in
hamster ureter
real-time quantitative rt-pcr was carried out using specific
primers corresponding to alpha1a-, alpha1b- and  xxxg87xxx 
sequences (table 1). the expression levels of the various alpha1adrenoceptor subtype mrnas were 30.8± 7.5 (alpha1a; n = 6), 3.5 ±
1.3 (alpha1b; n = 6) and 254.5 ± 113.0 (alpha1d; n = 6) copies/ng total
rna. thus, the relative expression level was at least eight times
higher for  xxxg87xxx  mrna (88.1%) than for alpha1a-(10.2%)
or  xxxg86xxx  (1.2%) in hamster ureter.
3.2. detection of alpha1-adrenoceptor protein expression by
immunohistochemical methods

to detect each alpha1-adrenoceptor subtype, immunohistochemistry was performed on the circular layer of the ureter using an
antibody against the relevant subtype. the alpha1a- and alpha1dadrenoceptors were the predominant subtypes located in
hamster ureteral smooth muscle (fig. 1), whereas the alpha1badrenoceptor was not detected at all (data not shown).

curve for phenylephrine to the right at concentrations equal to or
higher than 3 × 10− 6 mol/l (fig. 3).

3.3. effects of a-adrenoceptor agonists on hamster isolated
ureters
noradrenaline and phenylephrine produced concentrationdependent tonic contractions in hamster isolated ureters (fig. 2),
their pd2 values being 6.87 ± 0.08 and 6.10 ± 0.05, respectively.
the maximal contractions induced by noradrenaline and

alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists have been reported to increase
the stone discharge rate in ureteral-stone patients (yilmaz et al.,
2005; hollingsworth et al., 2006), an effect that might be related
to their inhibitory action against the ureteral contraction induced
by noradrenaline. however, it has not been shown which alpha1adrenoceptor subtypes play roles in ureteral contraction. we
therefore set out to investigate the alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes
present in the hamster ureter using molecular biological and
pharmacological techniques.
our results demonstrate that the mrnas for all three alpha1adrenoceptor subtypes are expressed in the hamster ureter, the
rank order we obtained for mrna expression being alpha1d(88.1%) ≫ alpha1a-(10.7%) n  xxxg86xxx  (1.2%). this finding is consistent with a previous report showing that in the
human ureter, alpha1a- and alpha1d-adrenoceptors are more abundant
than alpha1b-adrenoceptors (sigala et al., 2005). since we clearly
identified the proteins of both alpha1a- and alpha1d-adrenoceptors by
immunohistochemistry in the present study, it is probable that
these two subtypes predominate in the hamster ureter.
in our mechanical functional experiments on the hamster ureter,
 xxxd3202xxx  ( xxxg85xxx  selective antagonist) competitively
antagonized the phenylephrine-induced contraction, and its pa2
value was in good agreement with those reported for the alpha1aadrenoceptors in the isolated human and rabbit prostates (murata
et al., 2000; yamagishi et al., 1996). the antagonist potency of

y. tomiyama et al. / european journal of pharmacology 573 (2007) 201–205

 xxxd3202xxx  in our experiment (pa2 value = 9.44 ± 0.06) was much
greater than that of the selective  xxxg87xxx  antagonist
bmy-7378 (pa2 value = 5.75 ± 0.07). the pa2 value we obtained
for bmy-7378 in hamster ureter was much smaller than that
previously reported for an  xxxg87xxx -mediated response
(rat aorta; marti et al., 2005). in the present study, the alpha1badrenoceptor antagonist chloroethylclonidine (3 ×10− 6 mol/l or
more) produced a rightward shift in the concentration–response
curve for the phenylephrine-induced contraction. chloroethylclonidine reportedly (a) acted as a partial  xxxg85xxx  agonist in
rat fibroblasts expressing the  xxxg85xxx  (villalobos-molina
et al., 1997) and (b) antagonized the  xxxg85xxx -mediated
response in rat isolated caudal arteries at concentrations over
3 ×10− 6 mol/l (ibara et al., 2000). hence, chloroethylclonidine (at
3 ×10− 6 mol/l or more) probably affected alpha1a-adrenoceptors in
the hamster ureter. the alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating
ureteral contraction have not been reported in other species, and
so we are the first to demonstrate that stimulation of the alpha1aadrenoceptor subtype is mainly responsible for producing ureteral
contraction in any species (in the present case, in the hamster).
in human embryonic kidney hek293 cells, the  xxxg85xxx  subtype is expressed both on the cell surface and
intracellularly, whereas alpha1b-adrenoceptors are located on the cell
surface (chalothorn et al., 2002). since we found that alpha1aadrenoceptors could be identified by immunohistochemistry and
that they mediated contraction in the hamster ureter, this subtype
must be expressed on the cell surface of ureteral smooth muscle in
this species. neither an expression nor a mechanical function of the
 xxxg86xxx  could be confirmed in the hamster ureter and the
expression level of its mrnawas quite low. it is therefore probable
that alpha1b-adrenoceptors are poorly represented in this tissue. on the
other hand, alpha1d-adrenoceptors are located mainly intracellularly in
hek293 cells (chalothorn et al., 2002). our findings regarding
alpha1d-adrenoceptors were that its mrna was the most abundant of
the three alpha1-adrenoceptors subtypes and that its protein was
certainly present in the hamster ureter, yet this subtype participated
rather weakly in ureteral contraction. on that basis, it is highly
likely that alpha1d-adrenoceptors are expressed intracellularly in
hamster ureter. further investigation will be needed (by laser
scanning confocal microscopy) to clarify the location of each alpha1adrenoceptor subtype in the isolated ureteral smooth muscle cell.
alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists, which have been used clinically for benign prostatic hyperplasia, facilitate stone passage in
urolithiasis patients (yilmaz et al., 2005; hollingsworth et al.,
2006). since we demonstrated that alpha1a-adrenoceptors mediate
contraction in the hamster ureter,  xxxg85xxx  antagonists
may prove useful for suppressing contraction in a ureter in
which a stone is lodged.
5. conclusions
in hamster ureters, alpha1a- and alpha1d-adrenoceptors were more
abundant than the  xxxg86xxx , with the  xxxg85xxx 
playing the major role in mediating ureteral contraction. if this
is also true in humans,  xxxg85xxx  antagonists should be
useful as medication for stone passage in urolithiasis patients.
