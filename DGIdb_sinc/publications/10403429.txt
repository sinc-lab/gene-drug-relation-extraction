abstract
previous studies in our laboratory suggested that neuroprotective eects of the b2-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd1714xxx  in vitro
and in vivo occurred due to enhanced synthesis of  xxxg1564xxx . the aim of the present study was to evaluate the eects
of a phosphothioated ngf oligodeoxynucleotide on neuroprotection by  xxxd1714xxx  in vitro and in vivo.
after  xxxd1714xxx  treatment (1±100 mm) an increase in  xxxg1564xxx  mrna and protein levels (200±300% of control)
was observed in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes.  xxxg1564xxx  antisense oligonucleotide (0.3±1 mm for 3 days)
reduced the content of  xxxg1564xxx  protein in the medium of the astrocytes concentration-dependently to 20% of control
level.  xxxg1564xxx  content in the medium of mixed hippocampal cells was reduced to 55% of sister cultures receiving the
vehicle or a random control oligonucleotide. in mixed hippocampal cultures pretreated with random oligonucleotide (1 mm,
30 h),  xxxd1714xxx  (10 mm) reduced the percentage of damaged neurons after glutamate exposure (0.5 mm, 1 h) to 17%.
pretreatment with  xxxg1564xxx  antisense oligonucleotide (1 mm) for 30 h before glutamate incubation blocked the
protective eect of  xxxd1714xxx . in vivo,  xxxd1714xxx  (0.01±0.1 mg/kg) reduced the infarct volume in a rat model of permanent
focal cerebral ischemia dose-dependently.  xxxg1564xxx  antisense oligonucleotides injected into the cortical tissue before
ischemia abolished the cerebroprotective eect of  xxxd1714xxx .
our results indicate that the  xxxg1564xxx  antisense oligonucleotide presented in this study is a useful tool to investigate
the eects of  xxxg1564xxx  knock down. by using the  xxxg1564xxx  antisense oligonucleotide we could demonstrate
that  xxxg1564xxx  mediated the neuroprotective eects of the b2-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd1714xxx  in vitro and in
vivo. # 1999 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

both during development and in adulthood. a variety
of such factors has been identi®ed over recent years,
among them the neurotrophins  xxxg1564xxx 
(ngf),  xxxg259xxx  (bdnf),
 xxxg259xxx -3 ( xxxg1614xxx ) and  xxxg259xxx -4/5 (nt-4/5)
(lewin and barde, 1996). some of these factors prevented neuronal cell death in animal models of neuropathy, motoneural disorders and cerebral ischemia
(gao et al., 1997; hefti, 1997; lindsay, 1996; yuen
and mobley, 1995). thus, they are promising candidates for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.

the delivery of neurotrophic factors to the cns is one
of the large obstacles against their therapeutic usage,
since these proteins are not able to cross the bloodbrain-barrier. the induction of growth factor synthesis
in the brain by systemically administered lipophilic
drugs, such as the b2-adrenergic agonist  xxxd1714xxx ,
would be an elegant way to overcome these problems
of application (carswell, 1993; krieglstein et al., 1998;
mocchetti, 1991). in our laboratory,  xxxd1714xxx  has
been shown to protect neurons from excitotoxic
damage in mixed primary cultures of hippocampal
neurons (semkova et al., 1996b). the neuroprotective
eect of  xxxd1714xxx  was blocked by ngf-antibodies
suggesting a mechanism mediated by ngf (semkova
et al., 1996b). it has been proposed that astrocytes
released the  xxxg259xxx  after b2-adrenoceptor stimulation in the mixed hippocampal cells used in the previous study. astrocytes have been widely discussed as
a possible source of neuroprotective factors that support neuronal survival under lesioning conditions (lu
et al., 1991; mantyh et al., 1995; nieto-sampedro et
al., 1982; rudge, 1993).
in rat brain tissue, the stimulation of central b2receptors induced the synthesis of ngf- and bfgfmrna (follesa and mocchetti, 1993; hayes et al.,
1995). furthermore, the protective eects of  xxxd1714xxx  against ischemic damage in rat brain tissue were
accompanied by increased expression of ngf mrna
(semkova et al., 1996a). these ®ndings suggested a
neuroprotective potency of b2-adrenergic drugs against
neuronal damage in vivo that was mediated by induction of ngf. to further clarify this issue, it would be
necessary to block the expression of ngf. antisense
oligodeoxynucleotides (odn) have been used to
knock down the expression of speci®c proteins.
therefore, antisense odn are useful tools to investigate the role of speci®c proteins in vitro and in vivo
(schlingensiepen et al., 1997; wahlestedt, 1994;
wahlestedt et al., 1993). however, before investigating
the role of a speci®c protein by using antisense-technology, it is necessary to characterize the ecacy and
the speci®city of the antisense odn and, furthermore,
to exclude toxic eects on the system investigated in
vitro or in vivo. to our knowledge, there is no report
about an antisense odn directed against rat ngf expression.
here, we report about the eects of a newly
designed ngf antisense odn on the expression of
ngf in primary cultures of mixed hippocampal cells
and astrocytes. we demonstrated that the neuroprotective eect of  xxxd1714xxx  against glutamate-induced
excitototoxicity was blocked by antisense mediated
ngf knock down. furthermore, we injected the ngf
antisense oligonucleotide into cortical tissue to ®nd out
whether ngf mediated the protective eect of  xxxd1714xxx  against ischemic brain damage in vivo.

2. experimental procedures
2.1. animals
neonatal (p1±2) pups from fischer 344 rats
(charles river, sulzfeld, germany) were used for
preparing cultured cells. male long evans rats
(mùllegaard, denmark) were used for ischemia experiments. the animals were maintained under controlled
light and environmental conditions (12:12 h dark/light
cycle, 23 2 18c, 55% relative humidity) and had free
access to food (altromin, lage, germany) and water.
2.2. cell culture agents and other substances
eagle's minimum essential medium (mem) (containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 28 mm of glucose and 22 mm
of sodium bicarbonate), dulbecco's modi®ed mem
(dmem), leibovitz l-15 medium (containing 2 mm
l-glutamine), fetal calf serum, penicillin-neomycinstreptomycin solution and nu serum were obtained
from gibco (eggenstein, germany). sodium l-glutamate, cytosine-b-d-arabinofuranoside, streptavidine-alkaline phosphatase complex, trypsin-inhibitor and
papain were purchased from sigma (deisenhofen,
germany). anti-b (2.5 s, 7 s) ngf monoclonal antibody (clone 27/21), anti-b (2.5 s, 7 s) ngf-b-galactosidase (clone 27/21), ngf-b puri®ed from mouse
submaxillary glands, and cspd (disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2 '-(5 '-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.1.]decan}-4-yl  xxxd2915xxx ) were obtained
from boehringer mannheim (mannheim, germany).
rneasy kit was purchased from qiagen (hilden,
germany), oligo-(dt)-primer from mwg biotech
(ebersberg, germany), thermoprime plus dna polymerase, pcr buer and mgcl2 from advanced
biotechnologies (hamburg, germany), maloney
murine leukemia virus (mmlv)-reverse transcriptase,
biotin-7- xxxd1148xxx , dntp mix ( xxxd1148xxx , dctp,  xxxd1837xxx 
and dttp) and agarose from gibco (eggenstein,
germany), rnase-inhibitor and pcr-marker were
obtained from promega (heidelberg, germany).
2.3. antisense oligodeoxynucleotides
the rat ngf antisense odn and a random control
odn with full phosphothioate-modi®ed internucleoside backbones were synthesized by mwg-biotech
(ebersberg, germany). odns were used as follows: a
ngf antisense odn (5 '-cgctatgcacctggaaagac-3 ')
complementary to the binding site between the intron
and exon 3 of the ngf pre-mrna versus a random
control odn (5 '-accaaggcgttgcacagtca-3 '), which had
no complementarity with the ngf mrna, but the
same base composition as the antisense odn. odn
lyophilisates were dissolved in sterile water and then

c. culmsee et al. / neurochemistry international 35 (1999) 47±57

diluted in culture medium for ®nal concentrations of
0.3±1 mm in primary astrocyte cultures and 1 mm in
mixed hippocampal cultures, respectively. the diluted
odns were repeatedly added with medium changes
every 24 h for 3 days or 30 h before ngf protein
measurement in astrocytes or hippocampal cells (for
details see below).
2.4. primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes
primary cultures of astrocytes were prepared from
cerebral cortices of post-natal fischer 344 rats (pd
1±2) as described previously by mccarthy and
devellis (1980) with minor modi®cations (semkova et
al., 1996c). brie¯y, the animals were decapitated
under sterile conditions, the brains were removed and
stripped of meninges. cerebral cortices were isolated
and dissected in dmem containing penicillin-neomycin-streptomycin solution. the cells were seeded on
culture ¯asks (175 cm2, corning) and cultivated in
medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-neomycin-streptomycin solution in a humidi®ed atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co2 at 378c. the
culture medium was exchanged twice per week.
oligodendrocytes and microglial cells growing on the
astrocyte monolayer were removed by shaking and
washing with cold phosphate buered saline.
astrocytes determined for rna extraction were plated at a density of 1  104 cells/cm2 on culture ¯asks
(25 cm2; falcon, france) and cultivated in dmem
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillinneomycin-streptomycin solution till con¯uency was
reached. the cells were rinsed twice with hank's
 xxxd2988xxx  and were exposed for 24 h to
serum-free dmem. afterwards the astrocytes were
treated with  xxxd1714xxx  (1±100 mm, diluted in serumfree dmem). the control sister cultures received vehicle (serum-free dmem) only. after 4 h of incubation, the cells were rinsed with hank's  xxxd2988xxx   xxxd3213xxx 
solution and harvested by scraping from each ¯ask
into lysis buer (qiagen, hilden, germany) supplemented with b- xxxd26xxx  (10ml/ml). the
samples were stored at ÿ708c until use.
astrocyte conditioned medium for ngf protein
measurement by elisa was obtained from astrocytes
seeded on 24-well plates (multiwell; nunc, denmark)
at a density of 1  104 cells/cm2. further cultivation
was proceeded as described above. astrocytes were
incubated with dierent concentrations of  xxxd1714xxx 
(diluted in dmem) for 6 h. the control sister cultures
received the same volume of dmem. after 6 h of incubation, the medium was collected and centrifuged to
remove the cell debris. then 20 mg/ml aprotinin was
added and the supernatants were stored at ÿ208c until
use.

2.5. primary rat hippocampal cultures
primary mixed hippocampal cultures containing
neurons and astrocytes were prepared from neonatal
(p1) fisher 344 rats as described previously (semkova
et al., 1996b,c). brie¯y, after decapitation of the animals under sterile conditions, the hippocampi were isolated and incubated with papain (0.1% in l-15
medium) at 378c for 20 min. the supernatant was
removed and the tissue pieces were triturated in mem
containing 10% nu serum. after trituration of the tissue, 4 ml 1% trypsin-inhibitor in mem containing 1%
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (208c) was added and the mixture centrifuged (600 rpm, 208c, 10 min). the cells
were cultivated in mem supplemented with 10% nu
serum, 20 units/ml penicillin, 20 mg/ml streptomycin,
and were kept in a humidi®ed atmosphere of 95% air
and 5% co2 at 378c. after 2 days cytosine-b-d-arabinofuranoside (1 mm) was added to the medium for
24±36 h to minimize glial cell proliferation. the medium was changed every 3±4 days.
excitotoxic injury was induced in the rat hippocampal neurons after 14 days in vitro by the method of
koh and choi (1988). the cultures were washed with
serum-free mem and then exposed to serum-free
mem containing 0.5 mm l-glutamate for 1 h. the
glutamate containing medium was removed and
replaced with serum-free mem for 18 h. control sister
cultures not exposed to l-glutamate were also cultured
with serum-free mem. the percentage of damaged
neurons was determined 18 h later by trypan blue
exclusion. cells stained with trypan blue were considered to be non-viable. the identi®cation of neuronal
phenotype was based on the standard morphological
criteria such as phase bright fusiform and pyramidal
cell bodies which extend one or more processes.
for the measurement of ngf protein content, cultures grown for 14 days were exposed overnight to
serum-free mem containing 1 mm ngf antisense or
random control odn. control sister cultures received
the serum free mem only. after 24 h additional
0.3 nmol odns were administered to the cell culture
medium. in a parallel experiment the cell viability was
assessed by trypan blue staining after 30 h of incubation with antisense/random odn. the culture medium was collected for ngf protein measurement and
centrifuged to remove the cell debris. the supernatants
containing 20 mg/ml aprotinin were stored at ÿ208c
until use.
2.6. reverse transcriptionðpolymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr)
total cellular rna was extracted from cultured
astrocytes using the rneasy kit according to the man-

50

c. culmsee et al. / neurochemistry international 35 (1999) 47±57

ufacturer's instructions (qiagen, hilden, germany).
rna concentration was calculated by absorbance at
260 nm and purity was demonstrated by a260/a280
ratios between 1.7 and 2.0 (sembrook et al., 1989).
one microgram total rna was analysed by reverse
transcription and followed polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr). rt was performed at a volume of 45 ml.
rt solution contained: 1  pcr buer, 2.2 mm
mgcl2, dntp mix ( xxxd1148xxx , dctp,  xxxd1837xxx  and dttp,
0.2 mm each), 4 mm dithothreitol, 20 u rnaseinhibitor, oligo-(dt)-primer and rnase-free water. the
samples were heated to 658c for 5 min and chilled
on ice. mmlv-reverse transcriptase (50 u) was
added and rt was performed at 378c for 60 min
followed by a 5-min enzyme denaturation at 958c.
for subsequent pcr, 10 ml cdna solution was
used.
pcr was performed at a volume of 50 ml. pcr
solution contained: 1  pcr-buer, 2.0 mm mgcl2,
dntp mix ( xxxd1148xxx , dctp,  xxxd1837xxx  and dttp, 0.2 mm
each), 0.3 mm from each primer (sense and antisense)
and 1 u of thermoprime plus dna polymerase. pcr
was carried out in a thermal cycler (omni gene,
hybaid, teddington, uk). twenty-eight cycles of
pcr were performed (for ngf: initial template denaturation at 958c for 30 s; annealing with ngf primers
at 588c for 60 s; primer extension at 728c for 120 s;
for b-actin: initial template denaturation at 958c for
30 s; annealing with b-actin primers at 428c for 60 s;
primer extension at 728c for 120 s). the 28th cycle
was followed by a ®nal extension step at 728c for
5 min. the oligonucleotide primers for ngf were
designed according to the published sequence with a
predicted product size of 391 bp (sense: 5 '-ctggactaaacttcagcattc-3 '; antisense: 5 '-tgttgttaatgttcacctcgc3 '). in all experiments, rt-pcr of b-actin was carried
out concurrently (26 cycles) to control for sample
loading. primers for b-actin were as shown below with
a predicted product size of 380 bp (sense: 5'-atttggcaccacactttctaca-3'; antisense: 5 '-tcacgcacgatttccctctcag3 ').
to rule out ampli®cation of genomic dna, all rtpcr experiments were routinely controlled by conducting pcr without rt reaction. pcr products were
analysed using 2% agarose gels and visualized using
ethidium bromide staining and uv transillumination.
ampli®ed cdna was transferred from the gels to a
nylon membrane (hybond n+, amersham). biotinlabeled pcr products were detected using a streptavidine-alkaline phosphatase complex. chemiluminescence was produced by the reaction of cspd with
alkaline phosphatase. the bands were visualized using
an autoradiography ®lm (kodak). the integrated optical density of the bands was measured by means of an
image analysing system (ibas 2; kontron, eching,
germany).

2.7. semiquantitative measurements of the pcr
products
to investigate the cycle characteristics of ngf
cdna ampli®cation the pcr product corresponding
to 1 mg total rna was analysed densitometrically
after performing 22±30 pcr cycles. on the basis of
this cycle characterization, measurement of pcr products for semiquantitative analysis was performed
within exponential ampli®cation rate at 28 pcr-cycles.
for semiquantitative analysis, ngf cdna was ampli®ed using dierent amounts of total rna (2, 1, 0.5
and 0.25 mg) extracted from saline and  xxxd1714xxx 
(100 mm)-treated astrocyte cultures. semiquantitative
comparisons of the amounts of ngf mrna from the
treated groups was possible, as for both a linear correlation of the pcr product's integrated optical density
to the range of investigated total rna could be
demonstrated.
2.8. ngf protein measurement
a two-site enzyme immune assay for ngf was performed as described by korsching and thoenen (1983)
with minor modi®cations. monoclonal anti-ngf antibodies (clone 27/21) speci®c for mouse, rat, beef and
human ngf were used. the wells of microtiter plates
(maxisorb, nunc 96-well) were coated with buer solution (50 ml/well) containing 50 mm na2co3/
nahco3 buer ph 9.6, 0.05% sodium azide and
0.5 mg/ml anti-ngf-b monoclonal antibodies for 3 h
at 378c. non-speci®c binding sites were saturated with
150 ml/well blocking solution containing 1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx . the wells were washed three times
with buer solution (50 mm tris-hcl, 300 mm nacl,
10 mm mgcl2, 0.1% triton x-100, 0.05% sodium
azide, ph 7.0). the samples and the standard solution
(7.5±250 pg/ml of ngf) were added and the microtiter
plates were incubated for 5 h at room temperature.
after washing three times, anti-ngf-b monoclonal
antibodies conjugated to b-galactosidase diluted to 0.2
u/ml with buer solution (50 mm tris-hcl, 200 mm
nacl, 10 mm cacl2, 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx ,
0.05% sodium azide, 1% triton x-100, ph 7.0) were
added at a volume of 50 ml/well. the microtiter plates
were incubated at 48c overnight and then washed
three to four times. the wells were ®lled with freshly
prepared substrate solution of 4-methylumbelliferyl-bgalactose 20 mg/ml, 100 ml/well) diluted in wash buer.
the ¯uorescence was measured (extinction at 360 nm,
emission at 450 nm) by means of a ¯uorescenceelisa plate reader (fl 500; bio-tek, heidelberg,
germany). standard curves were prepared with 2.5 s
ngf-b standard puri®ed from mouse submaxillary
glands by assaying parallel wells containing increasing
amounts of ngf-b (7.5±250 pg/ml). the amount of

51

ngf-b in the samples was calculated from the standard curve.
2.9. permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (mca)
was performed in male long evans rats (mùllegaard,
denmark) according to the method described by
tamura et al. (1981) with modi®cations as previously
described by semkova et al. (1996c). the animals were
anesthetized with halothane (1.5% in a mixture of o2/
n2o 30:70). an incision was made through the left
temporalis muscle perpendicular to a line between the
external auditory canal and lateral canthus of the left
eye. under direct visualization with the surgical microscope, a burr hole was made with a handheld drill to
expose the left middle cerebral artery. after rejecting
the dura the left middle cerebral artery was occluded
by microbipolar electrocoagulation. after occlusion
the incisions in the left temporal muscle and the skin
were closed by the adhesive histoacryl (braun±dexon,
germany) to guarantee the function of the temporal
muscle for the uptake of food after surgery. this
modi®ed model of middle cerebral artery occlusion
produces exclusively cortical infarction. during surgical procedure the body temperature was maintained at
37 2 0.5 8c by means of a heating pad. to prevent a
decrease of body temperature, the animals were kept
at an environmental temperature of 308c up to 2 h
after middle cerebral artery occlusion. mean arterial
blood pressure and plasma glucose concentration as
well as arterial ph, pco2 and po2 were monitored
(corning 178, corning, germany) 3±4 h after  xxxd1714xxx  administration. seven days after middle cerebral
artery occlusion, the rats were anesthetized with
chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.) and decapitated.
brains were removed and frozen in 2-methylbutane at
ÿ20 to ÿ30 8c (fluka, switzerland). for histological
evaluation transversal sections of 20 mm thickness were
taken every 0.5 cm using a cryomycrotome (frigocut,
reichert-jung, germany) and stained with 0.5% cresyl
violet to dierentiate between intact and damaged
brain tissue. morphometric determination of the
manually outlined surface (mm2) was performed using
a computer based image analysis system (kontron,
germany). the infarct volume (mm3) was calculated
from the infarct area of each section and the distance
between succeeding sections.
 xxxd1714xxx  (0.001±0.1 mg/kg) was administered
intraperitoneally 3 h before mca occlusion. control
animals received physiological saline solution only.
ngf antisenseoligonucleotides, random oligonucleotides (3 nmol/2 ml) or vehicle (krebs±ringer-solution,
2 ml, ph 7.35, 300 mosmol) were repeatedly injected
every 12 h for 2 days before induction of ischemia.
for application of the oligonucleotides into brain tis-

rat cortical astrocytes were incubated for 3 h in serum-free medium
with  xxxd1714xxx  (1±100 mm). total rna was extracted from drugtreated and control sister cultures after pooling the cells from ®ve
dierent experiments. ngf mrna was reversed transcribed for 1 h
at 378c and ampli®ed by polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr, 28
cycles). b. in order to determine semiquantitatively the increase in
ngf mrna synthesis by  xxxd1714xxx  compared to control sister cultures rt-pcr (28 cycles) was performed from a dilution line of
total rna (0.25±1mg). the products were simultaneously labeled
adding biotinylated  xxxd1148xxx  to the pcr-reagents. the pcr products
were electrophoreses in 2% agarose gel, blotted to a nylon membrane and detected on an autoradiography-®lm by a streptavidinperoxidase-cspd system. the optical densities (iod) of the signals
were determined by means of an image analysing system, revealing a
3-fold increase in ngf mrna synthesis in astrocytes after 3 h exposure to  xxxd1714xxx  (100 mm).

sue the animals were anaesthetized with halothane
(1.5% in a mixture of o2/n2o 30:70) and their head
was ®xed in a stereotactic frame. a 5ml syringe
(hamilton, switzerland) was used for the injections.
the last injection of the oligonucleotides was performed 1 h before  xxxd1714xxx  administration and 4 h
before mca-occlusion.

3.1. stimulation of ngf mrna and ngf protein
synthesis in cultured astrocytes by  xxxd1714xxx 
ngf mrna levels were determined after exposure
of rat cortical astrocytes to  xxxd1714xxx  (1±100 mm) for
4 h by rt-pcr. fig. 1a represents a photograph of
the rt-pcr products visualized after electrophoresis
in a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. the
bands showing the expression of ngf mrna in the
samples are located between 300 and 500 bp of the
size standard (expected size 391 bp).  xxxd1714xxx  (1±
100 mm) increased the expression of ngf mrna in
astrocytes after 3 h of incubation. in all experiments

concentration of 1 mm ngf antisense, that reduced
the ngf concentration to 20% of control levels. the
medium was pooled from six dierent experiments.
the viability of astrocytes was not aected by exposure to the dierent concentrations of ngf antisense odn.
ngf antisense odn (1 mm, 30 h) reduced the
ngf content in the medium of hippocampal cultures
to 50% (p < 0.05) compared to control sister cultures
treated with saline or random odn (fig. 4). the random odn did not in¯uence the concentration of
ngf in the culture medium compared to controls.
neither the antisense nor the random odn aected
the neuronal viability in mixed hippocampal cells.

primary mixed hippocampal cultures were preincubated with 1 mm of ngf antisense odn 30 h before

eect of the suppression of ngf protein synthesis on
the neuroprotective eect of  xxxd1714xxx  (10 mm) in

(0.1 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 3 h before focal cerebral ischemia. injection of random oligonucleotides resulted in severe in¯ammation of the injection site, while antisense or vehicle did not induce an abscess. mean infarct volumes2 s.d. determined 7 days after ischemia

glutamate exposure was not aected by preincubation
with ngf antisense odn or random odn (1 mm,
30 h each). in contrast, the neuroprotective eect of
 xxxd1714xxx  pretreatment (10 mm, 6 h) was only found
to be aected by the ngf antisense odn.  xxxd1714xxx  signi®cantly reduced the percentage of
damaged neurons to 17% (p < 0.01) evaluated 18 h
after exposure to glutamate in the cultures preincubated with random odn. this neuroprotective eect
was blocked by ngf antisense odn (percentage of

seven days after permanent occlusion of the left
mca cortical infarct volumes were determined.  xxxd1714xxx  (0.01±0.1 mg/kg) administered 3 h before ischemia reduced the mean infarct volumes dose-dependently to 82% and 62% of the control value,
respectively (fig. 6). the no-eect level of  xxxd1714xxx 
was determined at 0.001 mg/kg. a protective eect of
the drug was observed also at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg,
while dosages higher than 1 mg/kg did not reduce the
infarct volume. at dosages higher than 1 mg/kg the
b2-mimetic drug signi®cantly reduced the mean arterial

blood pressure and increased blood glucose levels
(semkova et al., 1996a).
3.5. ngf antisense oligodeoxynucleotide blocks the
protective eect of  xxxd1714xxx  against ischemic brain
damage in vivo
ngf antisense, random oligonucleotides and vehicle
were injected into the cortical tissue of the rats every
12 h starting 2 days before mca occlusion. the dose
of  xxxd1714xxx  (0.1 mg/kg) that was most eective in
the previous set of ischemia experiments was administered intraperitoneally 3 h before ischemia. in animals
receiving vehicle injections  xxxd1714xxx  reduced the
infarct volume to 57% of controls (fig. 7). in animals
pretreated with ngf antisense oligonucleotides no
dierence of infarct volumes was determined between
the groups. there was also no dierence between the
two control groups that received vehicle and antisense
injections into cortical tissue, respectively (fig. 7). in
contrast, severe in¯ammation was found in the cortical
tissue of animals that received the random oligonucleotides. in these animals an abscess was found in the
infarcted tissue seven days after ischemia. the random
oligonucleotide signi®cantly increased the infarct
volume compared to vehicle- and antisense-treated
controls. there was no signi®cant reduction of the
infarct volume by  xxxd1714xxx  in rats pretreated with
the random oligonucleotide (fig. 7).

4. discussion
investigating the ngf antisense oligonucleotide
eect in the present study, we could demonstrate that
the neuroprotective eect of the b2-adrenergic drug
 xxxd1714xxx  against glutamate-induced damage of cultured hippocampal neurons was mediated by ngf.
moreover, the ngf antisense blocked the protective
eect of  xxxd1714xxx  in a model of focal cerebral ischemia in the rat, suggesting a mechanism mediated by
ngf.
these ®ndings are in line with our previous results
showing that  xxxd1714xxx  increases ngf synthesis in
mixed hippocampal cultures and also in mice and rat
brain tissue (semkova et al., 1996a,b). although the
precise mechanisms that led to ngf induction and
neuronal survival after glutamate-induced neurotoxicity were not entirely clari®ed, it was suggested that
the activation of b2-adrenergic receptors was a main
feature of the  xxxd1714xxx  eect. several adrenergic
drugs have been demonstrated to increase ngf synthesis and release (carswell 1993; hayes et al., 1995).
furthermore, both the induction of ngf synthesis
and the neuroprotective eect of  xxxd1714xxx  in vitro
were blocked by propranolol, a b-receptor antagonist
(semkova et al., 1996b).
it has been suggested that neurons are the source of
enhanced ngf synthesis after stimulation of b2-adrenergic receptors by  xxxd1714xxx  (follesa and mocchetti,
1993). this might be true under physiological conditions. on the other hand, the situation is totally
dierent in the lesioned brain as for example after
ischemia when astrocytes and microglial cells are activated and their pattern of cytokine expression has
changed. astrocytes in culture, as well as in various
regions of the mammalian cns, have been shown to
express b2-adrenergic receptors (mantyh et al., 1995;
salm and mccarthy, 1989; sutin and shao, 1992).
furthermore, there is evidence that expression of breceptors increased in astrocytes in response to cns
injury or disease (hodges-savola et al., 1996). in line
with these ®ndings, the present study demonstrates an
increase in ngf synthesis and release in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes after b2-adrenergic
receptor stimulation. our data from rt-pcr indicates
that  xxxd1714xxx  increases the de novo synthesis of
ngf in astrocytes. the semiquantitative analysis of
pcr products obtained from astrocytes treated with
100 mm  xxxd1714xxx  revealed a 3-fold increase in ngf
mrna synthesis versus control sister cultures. these
pcr results were con®rmed by ngf elisa that also
revealed a 2 to 3-fold increase by  xxxd1714xxx  treatment
(1±100 mm) in astrocytes. thus, it is suggested that the
pharmacological stimulation of ngf synthesis in
astrocytes contributes substantially to the neuroprotective eects of  xxxd1714xxx . interestingly,  xxxd1714xxx 

55

enhanced the expression of gfap after mca occlusion in rat brain tissue suggesting an increased activation of astrocytes by the b2-mimetic drug after
ischemia (culmsee et al., 1999).
there is evidence from our work that drugs which
increase the content of ngf in the cns also reduce
the damage of brain tissue after cerebral ischemia
(semkova et al., 1996b;c). here, we demonstrate that
 xxxd1714xxx  reduced the infarct volume after focal cerebral ischemia at dosages that were shown to enhance
growth factor synthesis in rat brain tissue (semkova et
al., 1996a). however, it remained to be clari®ed if
ngf was the only or at least the main mediator of
the neuroprotective activity of  xxxd1714xxx  in vivo. to
further investigate this issue we blocked ngf synthesis
in vitro and in vivo by a speci®c ngf antisense oligodeoxynucleotide directed against the binding site of the
intron to exon 3 of the ngf pre-mrna. in cultured
astrocytes and mixed hippocampal cells we could
demonstrate a down-regulation of ngf-synthesis by
ngf antisense. in primary cultures of cortical astrocytes a concentration-dependent ngf knock down
was found. this result suggested that ngf antisense blocked the neuroprotection against excitotoxicity by  xxxd1714xxx  in mixed hippocampal cells mainly
due to a reduction of ngf expression in astrocytes.
although the mechanisms of antisense inhibition are
not precisely known, it is discussed that antisense directed to pre-mrna may inhibit either polyadenylation, transport into cytoplasm and interfere with
mrna maturation (kim and wold, 1985; kulka
et al., 1989). phosphothioated oligodeoxynucleotides
have become the most extensively tested and best
characterized antisense agents in vitro and in vivo
due to their relatively high stability, their cellular
uptake and their accumulation in the cytoplasm
(schlingensiepen et al., 1997). the speci®city of the
antisense against ngf synthesis in hippocampal cells
was con®rmed by the incubation of sister cultures with
a random control odn that contained the same phosphothioated nucleotides as the speci®c ngf antisense
odn, but in a dierent order that did not match to
the ngf mrna. the viability of neurons was not
in¯uenced by odn under control conditions nor after
glutamate exposure. in the group treated with random
control odn  xxxd1714xxx  (10 mm, 6 h) reduced the
neuronal cell death after glutamate treatment. this
®nding recon®rms the previously demonstrated neuroprotective eect of  xxxd1714xxx  in this cell culture system. furthermore, this result indicates that the
protection against glutamate-induced neuronal cell
death is not in¯uenced by the random control odn.
by contrast, the ngf antisense odn abolished the
protective eect of  xxxd1714xxx , most likely because of
the suppression of ngf synthesis.
based on these encouraging in vitro results we

56

c. culmsee et al. / neurochemistry international 35 (1999) 47±57

injected the ngf antisense odn into the rat cortex to
suppress ngf induction by  xxxd1714xxx  in vivo.
injections were performed repeatedly every 12 h starting 2 days before mca-occlusion to achieve an appropriate distribution of the antisense odn within the
brain tissue, as controlled by an digoxigenin-labelled
ngf antisense oligonucleotide (data not shown). the
reduction of the infarct volume by  xxxd1714xxx  was
totally blocked in animals pretreated with ngf antisense odn. the antisense odn itself did not alter the
infarct size as compared to vehicle treated ischemic
controls. however, the result from this in vivo study
has to be interpreted cautiously, as the controls receiving the random oligonucleotides revealed a severe toxic
eect of this phosphothioated control oligonucleotides.
such toxic eects have been suggested to occur in vivo
due to unspeci®c toxic eects of the phosphothioated
nucleotides themselves as well as due to unpredictable
interferences of the random oligonucleotide with
speci®c mrna or dna sequences that have not been
identi®ed yet (crooke 1998; levin et al., 1998;
schlingensiepen et al., 1997). in our study, the random
odn induced a severe in¯ammatory response in the
brain tissue that signi®cantly increased the brain
damage after focal cerebral ischemia compared to vehicle and to antisense treated ischemic animals. this
in¯ammatory transformation by the random oligonucleotide resulted in the formation of an abscess and in
consequence abolished the protective eect of  xxxd1714xxx . as no such in¯ammatory transformation was
observed in animals treated with antisense oligonucleotides we concluded that the  xxxd1714xxx -induced protection of brain tissue against ischemic damage was
blocked speci®cally, i.e. protection was abolished due
to the ngf antisense knock down. in spite of the
toxic eect found with the random oligonucleotide our
result indicated that in line with our ®ndings in vitro
ngf mediated the cerebroprotective eect of  xxxd1714xxx  against ischemic brain damage in vivo. our
results indicate furthermore that studies performed
with antisenseoligonucleotides in vivo have to be interpreted carefully as unspeci®c toxicity of the nucleotides
could lead to opposite results than expected.
in conclusion, we showed that the induction of
ngf synthesis caused the cerebroprotective eects of
 xxxd1714xxx  against ischemic brain damage. the newly
designed ngf antisense odn presented in this study
is a promising tool to investigate the meaning of ngf
induction for neuronal survival in vitro and in vivo. it
is suggested from our data that astrocytes activated by
 xxxd1714xxx  were involved in the demonstrated cerebroprotective eects, most likely by an elevation of
growth factor synthesis in this glial population. in conclusion, the endogenous induction of growth factor
synthesis in brain tissue by stimulation of b2-receptors
could become a new therapeutic strategy for the treat-

ment of chronic neurodegenerative disorders and
stroke.
