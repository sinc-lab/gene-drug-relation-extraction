[the effects of site-directed chemotherapy due to e2 as a drug carrier to the human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells in vitro].  the effects of  xxxd2041xxx , a  xxxd2551xxx   xxxd2552xxx  ( xxxd2551xxx ) derivative of estradiol-17 beta versus the free  xxxd2551xxx  on cell kinetics of the  xxxg730xxx  positive human endometrial cancer cell line hec-1 were investigated using flow cytometry. the results were as follows. the cell killing effects of  xxxd2041xxx  existed in a dependency on dose and time, whereas those of  xxxd2551xxx  were dependent on dose alone.  xxxd2551xxx  at 1 microgram/ml showed a marked increase in s phase and decrease in g0+1 phase. however, with equivalent doses of  xxxd2041xxx   xxxd1891xxx  micrograms/ml, even more remarkable was the accumulation in the g2+m phase. synchronization at s phase with mtx showed no increase in sensitivity to these drugs on cells in s phase. based on the above results, it was suggested that the free  xxxd2551xxx  had an affect regardless of the cell cycle phase, whereas the effects of  xxxd2041xxx  corresponded to the cell cycle phase and  xxxd2041xxx  might have a fixed population of non-target cells existing in the g0+1 and s phase. synchronization in the g1 phase with sodium n-butylate could increase the target effects of  xxxd2041xxx  in s phase.
