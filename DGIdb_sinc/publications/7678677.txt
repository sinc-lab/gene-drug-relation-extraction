summary: we studied the effects of  xxxd123xxx  and bro-
moacetylalprenololmenthane (baam) on rat left atria.
 xxxd123xxx  and baam at 1077, 3 x 107’, and 107° m
inhibited the cardiac stimulation response slightly, which
is indicative of membrane-stabilizing activity independent
of b-adrenoceptor blockade. this membrane-stabilizing
activity was readily reversible.  xxxd123xxx  and baam
also caused surmountable antagonism of  xxxd2398xxx  re-

sponses, and this b,-adrenoceptor antagonism was slowly
reversible. inhibition of the  xxxd2398xxx  responses with
 xxxd123xxx  and baam at 107° m was at equilibrium after
60 min, which is indicative of reversible antagonism.
we conclude that  xxxd123xxx  and baam are competitive
slowly reversible 8,-adrenoceptor antagonists on rat
left atria. key words:  xxxd123xxx —baam—8,-
adrenoceptors.

 

the data from a study of the effect of a compet-
itive irreversible antagonist on an agonist concen-
tration—-response curve may be used to determine
the dissociation constant of the agonist (k,) and the
receptor reserve for the agonist on any tissue (1).
such studies of the effects of b-agonists at
b-adrenoceptors have been hampered until recently
by lack of competitive irreversible b-adrenoceptor
antagonists. baam is the bromoacetylated deriva-
tive of  xxxd123xxx  menthane.  xxxd123xxx  and baam
are considered competitive reversible and compet-
itive irreversible b-adrenoceptor antagonists, re-
spectively [ xxxd123xxx  (2) and baam (3,4)]. baam
has been used in several contractility studies in at-
tempts to determine k, values for b-adrenoceptor
agonists and receptor reserves (5,6) but has not al-
ways proven a reliable tool.  xxxd1704xxx  and colleagues
(6) observed that the apparent k, values for pren-
alterol were different in rat atria exposed to low and
high concentrations of baam. one possible reason
for this unreliability with baam is that baam may
not be a completely irreversible b-adrenoceptor an-
tagonist.

no contractility studies have examined the re-
versibility of b-adrenoceptor antagonism with al-

 xxxd240xxx , and only two have examined its revers-
ibility with baam. posner and co-workers (3)
showed that the effects of baam on  xxxd2398xxx 
response curves of rat left atria were not altered by
a 2-h washout period. in contrast, in a preliminary
study, we observed that the effects of baam on the
 xxxd2398xxx  response curves of rat left atria were
slowly reversed by washing in baam-free solution.
subsequently, we performed an extensive study
comparing the inhibitory effects of  xxxd123xxx  and
baam. we report inhibition by  xxxd123xxx  and
baam of the responses of rat left atria to cardiac
stimulation and of the responses of electrically
driven rat left atria to  xxxd2398xxx  and the effects of
two 600 ml/60-min washes in  xxxd123xxx /baam-free
krebs solution on this inhibition. second, the ef-
fects of different  xxxd123xxx /baam treatment times
on  xxxd2398xxx  responses were determined because
reversible and slowly reversible but not irreversible
antagonists come to equilibrium (1).

methods

male wistar rats weighing 250-350 g were stunned and
exsanguinated. the hearts were rapidly removed and

experiments were performed with a modified krebs so-
lution (composition in mm of nacl 116, kci 5.4,  xxxg2125xxx ,
2.5, mgcl, 1.2, nah,po, 1.2, nahco, 22, p-glucose
11.2, na,edta 0.04) at 37°c and bubbled with 5% co, in
o,. contractile responses were measured isometrically
with force displacement transducers (grass model
fto3.c, quincy, ma, u.s.a.) and displayed on a poly-
graph (grass model 79b). in each series of experiments,
the individual values (percentages, slopes, pd, values,
concentration ratios, and pa, values) obtained were sub-
ject to by student's ¢ test. differences were considered
significant at p < 0.05. mean values + sem were also
obtained.

the method for recording the contractile responses of
electrically driven rat left atria was previously used in our
research (7). left atria were removed from hearts and
halved. each atria half was mounted longitudinally be-
tween two platinum electrodes (~3 cm apart, above and
below the tissue) under | g tension in s-ml organ baths
containing krebs solution [with 107° m  xxxd2243xxx , to
prevent release of norepinephrine (ne) from nerve end-
ings, and atropine 107° m] and allowed to equilibrate for
75 min. during the equilibration period, 750 ml krebs
solution superfused the tissue. stimulation at 4 hz (5 ms,
10 v) was then started and after 9 min a cumulative chal-
lenge with  xxxd2398xxx  was initiated on a 3-min cycle.
this cycle was continued until a maximum response was
obtained. two series of experiments were then per-
formed.

effects of  xxxd123xxx  or baam treatment followed
by washing in b-blocker—-free krebs solution

one atria half was treated with  xxxd123xxx  or baam for
60 min; the other tissue of the pair was not treated. dur-

ing this 60 min, 600 ml @-blocker-free or ®b-blocker-
containing krebs overflowed the tissue. the tissues were
then electrically stimulated and cumulatively challenged
with  xxxd2398xxx  until an  xxxd2398xxx  maximum re-
sponse was obtained. all tissues were then washed with
600 ml of b-blocker-free krebs solution for 60 min before
a third challenge to cardiac stimulation and  xxxd2398xxx .
another 600-ml b-blocker-free krebs solution wash pre-
ceded a fourth challenge to cardiac stimulation and iso-
prenaline.

effect of prolonged treatment with  xxxd123xxx 
or baam

one atria half was treated with  xxxd123xxx  or baam for
120 min; the other tissue of the pair was not treated.
during this 120-min period, 1,200 ml ®-blocker-free or
6-blocker-containing krebs solution overflowed the tis-
sue. the tissues were then electrically stimulated and cu-
mulatively challenged with  xxxd2398xxx .

data assessment

the contractile responses to cardiac stimulation just
before the second, third, and fourth challenges with iso-
prenaline were calculated as a percentage of the response
to stimulation before the first challenge with  xxxd2398xxx .
if the responses to cardiac stimulation between treated
and untreated tissues were significantly different, the per-
centage difference was calculated. for each challenge
with  xxxd2398xxx , the response to cardiac stimulation just
before the challenge with  xxxd2398xxx  was subtracted
from the combined response to cardiac stimulation and
 xxxd2398xxx . the maximum combined responses to car-
diac stimulation and  xxxd2398xxx  were calculated as a
percentage of the maximum from the first challenge to
 xxxd2398xxx  challenge. if the maximum responses to car-

diac stimulation and  xxxd2398xxx  between treated and un-
treated tissues were not significantly different, all re-
sponse curves were calculated as a percentage of the
maximum of the individual curves, i.e., normalized. if the
maximum responses to cardiac stimulation and isoprena-
line between treated and untreated tissues were signifi-
cantly different, the combined response curves were cal-
culated as a percentage of the maximum of the first curve.
when the combined maximum responses were reduced in
treated tissues, responses to  xxxd2398xxx  were normal-
ized if the decrease in the maximum combined response
was not significantly greater than the inhibitory effect on
the response to cardiac stimulation alone.

slopes were determined for all  xxxd2398xxx  response
curves. in addition, when responses to  xxxd2398xxx  were
normalized, pd,, concentration-ratio and pa, values
were determined. the slope (difference in percentage
maximum of the response/unit of logarithm of molar con-
centration of  xxxd2398xxx ) and pd, value were computed
by regression line analysis performed on the steepest part
of the response curve, which was usually over the range
of 20-80% of the maximum response. for each tissue, the
concentration ratios (the antilog of the difference between
the pd, values) were determined between each challenge
with  xxxd2398xxx . previous studies showed that the sen-
sitivity to  xxxd2398xxx  decreases with successive chal-
lenges in rat left atria (8). consequently concentration
ratios obtained in the presence of b-blockers had to be
corrected for changes occurring in untreated atria. thus,
the difference in mean pd, values from b-blocker—
untreated atria were subtracted from the difference in in-
dividual pd, values from ®-blocker-treated atria. pa,
values were determined for single concentrations of
6-blockers that had no effect on the slope of the isopren-
aline response curves by use of the formula: pa, = pa,
+ log (x — 1), where pa, is the negative logarithm of the
molar concentration of b-blocker and x is the concentra-
tion-ratio. pa, values for multiple concentrations of
b-blockers were determined by a schild plot [log (x — 1),
ordinate, versus the logarithm of the molar concentration
of antagonist, abscissa] using regression line analysis of
individual log (x — 1) values. a least-squares analysis
was performed to test whether the line of the schild plot
had a slope significantly different from 1. the pa, value
was the abscissa intercept when the slope was not signif-
icantly different from 1.

drugs

the drugs used were  xxxd123xxx  hydrochloride (donated
by astra, sydney, nsw, australia), baam (bromo-
acetylalprenololmenthane, research biochemicals,
natick, ma, u.s.a. dissolved in  xxxd102xxx ), atro-
pine sulfate (serva, heidelberg, germany),  xxxd2243xxx 
sulfate, (—)- xxxd2398xxx  bitartrate (sigma chemical, st.
louis, mo, u.s.a.). the melting points of  xxxd123xxx  and
baam were determined by hot bench method to be
112.0° and 90.7°c, respectively, and are similar to those
reported previously (baam) (9).

results

direct muscle stimulation (4 hz, 5 ms, 10 v)
contracts rat left atria, and the force of contraction
is increased by  xxxd2398xxx  acting at b,-
adrenoceptors.

effect of  xxxd123xxx 

the responses of rat left atria to cardiac stimula-
tion were inhibited by a 60-min treatment with al-
 xxxd240xxx  at 107’, 3 x 1077 and 10-° m by 25% + 6
(8) (mean percentage of inhibition + sem, n = 8),
32% + 4 (8) and 27% + 6 (7), respectively. these
inhibitory effects on the cardiac stimulation re-
sponse were completely reversed by washing the
tissue with 600 ml  xxxd123xxx -free krebs solution for
60 min.

 xxxd123xxx  treatment for 60 min inhibited the re-
sponses of rat left atria to  xxxd2398xxx , and the in-
hibitory effects were slowly reversible.  xxxd123xxx 
 xxxd1891xxx ~’,3 x 10°’, and 10° m caused parallel right-
ward shifts of the response curves but had no effect
on  xxxd2398xxx  maxima (fig. 1). the mean pa, val-
ues calculated for  xxxd123xxx  using the formula pa,
= pa, + log (x — 1) were independent of concen-
tration of  xxxd123xxx , being 8.23 + 0.06 (8), 8.27 +
0.09 (8), and 8.08 + 0.09 (7) in the presence of al-
 xxxd240xxx  at 107’, 3 x 107’, and 10~° m, respec-
tively. the schild plot with all three concentrations
of  xxxd123xxx  (fig. 2) had a slope of 0.92, which was
not significantly different from 1, and a pa, value
for  xxxd123xxx  of 8.39. the inhibitory effects of al-
 xxxd240xxx  were not fully reversed by 600-m! washes

were slowly reversed by two washes of baam-free

were 6.3 + 1.4, 2.6 + 1.6, and 1.6 + 0.9 (8) in the

respectively.

after baam treatment at 107° m for 120 min,
the cardiac stimulation response was inhibited by 44

observed with a 60-min treatment. the inhibitory

discussion

baam has membrane-stabilizing activity, de-
fined as the ability to decrease the cardiac stimula-
tion response independently of b-adrenoceptor
blockade, on rat left atria (5). our results show that
this property is shared with modest concentrations
of  xxxd123xxx . membrane-stabilizing activity has
previously been reported only with a high concen-
trations of  xxxd123xxx  (10~° m) on rabbit papillary
muscle (2). a possible explanation for the mem-
brane-stabilizing activity observed with modest
concentrations of  xxxd123xxx  in this study but not in
previous studies is that the stabilizing activity is
more prominent after extensive superfusion with al-
 xxxd240xxx . in the present study, the tissues were su-
perfused with 600 ml  xxxd123xxx -containing krebs
solution, whereas in previous studies  xxxd123xxx 
was added to the organ bath (2,9).

the membrane-stabilizing activity of baam and
 xxxd123xxx  is not related to b-adrenoceptor antago-
nism because the membrane-stabilizing activity of
the drugs, but not the b-adrenoceptor antagonism,
is readily reversible. the membrane-stabilizing ac-
tivity of baam and  xxxd123xxx  probably results
from their accumulation in the lipids of the tissue
membranes from which they are readily released by
washing in baam/ xxxd123xxx -free krebs solution.

 xxxd123xxx  and baam are classified as competi-
tive reversible and competitive irreversible b-adre-
noceptor antagonists (described above). this clas-
sification is incorrect, because our results clearly
show that both  xxxd123xxx  and baam are compet-
itive slowly reversible antagonists and that the only
difference between these drugs at b,-adrenoceptors
is that  xxxd123xxx  is more potent than baam as an
antagonist. thus, two important observations show
baam to be a reversible rather than an irreversible
b-antagonist. first, the inhibitory effects of alpre-
nolol and baam on  xxxd2398xxx  responses were
similarly reversible with washing in  xxxd123xxx /
baam-free krebs solution. second, the inhibitory
effects of  xxxd123xxx  and baam on  xxxd2398xxx  re-
sponses came to equilibrium, there being no signif-
icant difference between the inhibition observed af-
ter 60- and 120-min equilibration. the effects of re-
versible, but not irreversible antagonists, come to
equilibrium.

previous radioligand binding studies (8,10,11) and
contractility investigations (3,12) have suggested
that baam is a competitive irreversible antagonist.
the major difference between these previous and
the present study is that we washed the tissue more
thoroughly. thus in our contractility study we
washed with 1,200 ml, whereas in the contractility
study of ng and malta (12) 80-ml krebs solution
was used as extensive washout. in addition to bind-
ing to b-adrenoceptors, baam is probably accu-
mulated by the lipids of the membrane, causing its

membrane-stabilizing action. during washing,
baam is readily released from the lipids and
slowly released from the b-adrenoceptors. in a low-
or no-flow wash, the baam released will be able to
associate or reassociate with the b-adrenoceptors;
consequently, b-adrenoceptor blockade will be
maintained and will appear to be irreversible. this
probably occurred with baam in previous studies
undertaken to ascertain its reversibility. in a rapid-
flow wash, as used in the present study, most of the
baam released will be carried away; conse-
quently, the membrane-stabilizing activity of
baam is readily reversed and 8,-adrenoceptor
blockade with baam is slowly reversed.

on rat left atria,  xxxd123xxx  and baam are com-
petitive slowly reversible 8,-adrenoceptor antago-
nists. because baam is not irreversible, it is not
suitable for use in studies to determine agonist k,
values and tissue receptor reserves.
