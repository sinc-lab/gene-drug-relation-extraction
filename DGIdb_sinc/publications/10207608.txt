 xxxg1759xxx  inhibitors p-bromophenacyl bromide and arachidonyl
tri¯uoromethyl ketone suppressed interleukin-2 (il-2) expression
in murine primary splenocytes

received: 27 july 1998 / accepted: 24 november 1998

abstract  xxxg1759xxx  (pla2) has been postulated
to play a role in the regulation of cytokine expression.
therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the eects of pla2 inhibitors p-bromophenacyl
bromide (bpb) and arachidonyl tri¯uoromethyl ketone
(aacocf3) on interleukin-2 (il-2) expression in murine
primary splenocytes. pretreatment of the splenocytes with
both bpb and aacocf3 suppressed  xxxd2925xxx  plus  xxxd2379xxx -induced il-2 secretion in
a concentration-dependent manner. inhibition >90% of
il-2 secretion was observed at 1 lm bpb and 10 lm
aacocf3 compared to the respective vehicle control.
likewise, il-2 steady-state mrna expression was inhibited by both pla2 inhibitors in a concentrationdependent fashion with >90% inhibition at 1 lm bpb
and 20 lm aacocf3. taken together, these data demonstrated that pla2 inhibitors bpb and aacocf3 are
robust inhibitors of il-2 expression at both the mrna
and protein levels in murine splenocytes. moreover, these
®ndings suggest that drugs and chemicals which inhibit
pla2 may have marked eects on t-cell function.

position of cellular phospholipids. this reaction is responsible for generating free  xxxd2154xxx  and lysophospholipids. pla2 is believed to be the ®rst rate-limiting
enzyme in eicosanoid formation. the secretory type ii
pla2 ( xxxg1760xxx ) of 14 kda and the cytosolic type iv
pla2 ( xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx ) of 85 kda are the most extensively investigated mammalian forms in this family and have
been identi®ed in various organs and tissues including
spleen, monocytes/macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils,
natural killer cells and lymphocytes (inada et al., 1991;
wijkander and sundler 1991; kim bonventre 1993;
murakami et al. 1993). pla2 plays a central role in diverse cellular processes including in¯ammation, cell
proliferation and signal transduction.  xxxg1760xxx  is proposed
to act as an acute phase protein, which is involved in the
pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease,
glomerulonephritis and septic shock.  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  preferentially targets sn-2 position of  xxxd208xxx -containing substrates.  xxxd208xxx  and its metabolites can
act as either intracellular second messengers or local
mediators, participating in the regulation of in¯ammatory responses (for review see murakami et al. 1997).
consistently, pla2 has been postulated to play a role in
the `cytokine circuit' and in the regulation of cytokine
synthesis in further perpetuating immune and in¯ammatory responses. this premise is supported by the fact
that synthesis and release of pla2 can be stimulated by
cytokines such as il-1, il-6,  xxxg2296xxx -a
( xxxg2296xxx ; crowl et al. 1991), il-2 (wolbink et al. 1995),
and interferon-c (ifn-c; ponzoni et al. 1992). furthermore, pla2-activating protein and mellitin, an activator
of pla2, increase il-1 and tnf expression in a doseand time-dependent manner in human monocytes
(bomalaski et al. 1995). however, little is known about
the mechanism by which pla2 regulates the expression
of cytokines.
il-2 is an autocrine/paracrine factor expressed by
activated t lymphocytes, which facilitates t-cell clonal
expansion and helps to regulate the actions of a variety
of other cell types including b cells, macrophage, and

2

natural killer cells. hence il-2 is critical in regulating a
variety of immune responses (smith 1988). highly regulated, the il-2 gene exhibits virtually no basal level of
expression. upon t-cell activation, il-2 gene expression
is rapidly but transiently induced. its expression is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level via a 50 promoter region extending 326 bp upstream of the
transcription start site (jain et al. 1995). the il-2 promoter consists of several regulatory sequences including
 xxxg810xxx   xxxg1222xxx   xxxg1223xxx   xxxg1224xxx  (ap-1), nuclear factor of activated
t cells (nf-at), nuclear factor for immunoglobulin
j chain in b cells (nf-jb)/rel, octamer (oct) and cd28
response element sites, to which transcription factors cooperatively bind to induce maximal il-2 gene transcription. protein tyrosine kinases (ptk), phospholipase c-c,
mitogen-activated protein (map) kinases protein kinase c (pkc) and ca2+ are upstream signaling pathways
and cooperatively regulate these transcription factors
(fraser et al. 1993). interestingly, pla2 may also be involved in regulating il-2 expression. exogenous  xxxg1760xxx 
has been shown to enhance expression of  xxxg1175xxx  a
subunit and thymidine incorporation into dna in human
resting t lymphocytes induced by diacylglycerol and
 xxxd2379xxx  (io) and suggest that pla2 may be involved in
t-cell activation (asaoka et al. 1993). pla2 inhibitor
p-bromophenacyl bromide (bpb) is reported to bind covalently to a histidine residue on pla2 and inhibit catalytic activity of  xxxg1760xxx  (volwerk et al. 1974; mayer and
marshall 1993) but not  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  (kim and bonventre 1993).
arachidonyl tri¯uoromethyl ketone (aacocf3), an
analogue of  xxxd208xxx , is a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  (street et al. 1993). aacocf3 has also
been recently reported to inhibit ca2+-independent pla2
(ackermann et al. 1995).
our results presented in this work demonstrated that
pla2 inhibitors bpb and aacocf3 strongly suppressed il-2 expression suggesting that pla2 may be an
important mediator in controlling the activation of the
il-2 gene. these ®ndings have important toxicological
implications: agents that inhibit pla2 activity will be
likely to produce a marked inhibition of cell-mediated
immune responses through a repression of t-cell clonal
expansion. along these same lines, pla2 potentially
represents an attractive therapeutic site for immune
modulation which up until now has been almost exclusively considered for controlling in¯ammation but may
in fact have broader applications.

materials and methods

spleens were isolated aseptically and made into single cell suspensions as described previously (kaminski et al. 1994). the splenocytes were cultured in rpmi 1640 medium (gibco brl,
gaithersburg, md.) supplemented with 100 u/ml penicillin,
100 lg/ml streptomycin, 5 ´ 10)5 m 2- xxxd26xxx , and 5%
bovine calf serum (hyclone, logan, utah). splenocytes
(1 ´ 106/ml) were pretreated with vehicle (0.1% ethanol), bpb
(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 5 lm) for 20 min and aacocf3 (1, 5, 10,
20, and 50 lm) for 15 min. splenocytes were subsequently activated with  xxxd2925xxx  (pma, 80 nm) plus io
(1 lm) in the continuous presence of indicated concentrations of
either bpb or aacocf3 for 6 h to evaluate il-2 steady-state
mrna expression, and for 24 h to analyze il-2 secretion. for
evaluating the eect of temporal addition of bpb on il-2 secretion,
splenocytes (1 ´ 106/ml) were pretreated with vehicle (vh, 0.1%
ethanol) or 0.1 lm bpb for 20 min and stimulated with pma
(80 nm) plus io (1 lm) for 24 h at 37 °c, treated at the same time
as the stimulators (time 0) or treated 30, 60, or 120 min after
stimulation. in all cases leukocytes were cultured at 37 °c in 5%
co2 and cell viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion.
quantitative competitive reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
all reagents used for rt-pcr were of molecular biology grade and
were purchased from promega co. (madison, wis.) unless otherwise noted. total rna was isolated using tri reagent (molecular
research center, cincinnati, ohio). il-2 steady-state mrna expression was quanti®ed by quantitative competitive rt-pcr as
described previously (ouyang et al. 1998). all isolated rna samples were con®rmed to be free of dna contamination as determined by the absence of product following pcr ampli®cation in
the absence of reverse transcriptase (gibco brl, data not shown).
il-2 protein quantitation
mouse recombinant il-2 (as standard), puri®ed rat anti-mouse il-2
antibody and biotinylated anti-mouse il-2 antibody were purchased
from pharmingen (san diego, calif.). splenocytes (1 ´ 106/ml) were
cultured in triplicate in 48-well cell culture plates (0.8 ml/well;
corning, n.y.), the supernatants were collected at 24 h after stimulation and quanti®ed for il-2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (elisa) as described previously (ouyang et al. 1995).
statistical analysis
the mean  se was determined for each treatment group in the
individual experiments. homogeneous data were evaluated by a
parametric analysis of variance. dunnett's two-tailed t-test was
used to compare treatment groups to the vehicle control and student-newman-keuls was used for treatment time study to compare
the bpb group with the corresponding vehicle control when signi®cant dierences were observed.

animals, reagents and cell culture

concentration-dependent inhibition
of il-2 expression by bpb

virus-free female b6c3f1 mice of 6 weeks of age were purchased
from charles river (dortage, mich.) and cared for as described
previously (ouyang et al. 1998). all reagents were purchased from
sigma chemical (st. louis, mo.) unless otherwise noted.
aacocf3 was purchased from calbiochem (la jolla, calif.) and
constituted in  xxxd102xxx , aliquoted, and stored under nitrogen at )80 °c. working solution was prepared freshly just prior
to addition to culture.

we initially evaluated the eect of bpb on pma/ioinduced il-2 expression. bpb was selected for these
studies because experimentally it is one of the most
frequently used and therefore one of the most extensively characterized pla2 inhibitors. splenocytes were
activated with pma/io in the presence and absence of

3

bpb and supernatants were measured for il-2 activity
at 24 h by elisa. bpb produced a marked concentration-dependent inhibition of il-2 secretion compared
with the vehicle control as demonstrated by 16, 75, and
93% inhibition in il-2 activity at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 lm,
respectively (fig. 1). no signi®cant eect on cell viability was observed at any of the bpb treatment concentrations compared with the pma/io activated, time
matched controls.
the eect of bpb on steady-state il-2 mrna expression was also evaluated. because peak expression of
steady-state il-2 mrna occurs between 4 and 8 h after
t-cell activation, and returns to background levels by
24 h (jain et al. 1995), splenocytes were harvested and
rna was isolated at 6 h. the magnitude of il-2 mrna
expression was quanti®ed by competitive rt-pcr
(fig. 2). bpb inhibited steady-state il-2 mrna expression in a concentration-dependent manner by 18, 86,
and 96% at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 lm bpb, respectively,
compared to the vehicle control. at 5 lm bpb, both
il-2 secretion and il-2 mrna expression were below
the level of quantitation. overall bpb exhibited a similar
magnitude of potency in its ability to inhibit both il-2
steady-state mrna expression and protein secretion
suggesting that the two eects are mechanistically
related.
concentration-dependent inhibition
of il-2 expression by aacocf3
as stated above, a previous study demonstrated that
bpb had no eect on  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  (kim and bonventre 1993).
therefore, the eect of aacocf3 on pma/io-induced

il-2 expression was further evaluated. similarly to bpb,
aacocf3 produced a dramatic concentration-dependent inhibition of il-2 secretion compared with the vehicle control with 39, 71, 92 and 98% inhibition at 1, 5,
10, and 20 lm aacocf3, respectively (fig. 3). similarly no signi®cant eect on cell viability was observed at
any of the aacocf3 treatment concentrations compared with the controls. likewise, aacocf3 inhibited
the level of steady-state il-2 mrna in a concentrationdependent fashion by 18, 47, 65, and 91% at 1, 5, 10,
and 20 lm aacocf3, respectively, compared with the
vehicle control (fig. 4). at 50 lm aacocf3 both il-2
secretion and il-2 mrna expression were below the
level of quantitation.
time-dependent inhibition of il-2 expression by bpb

fig. 1 concentration-dependent inhibition of interleukin-2 (il-2)
secretion by p-bromophenacyl bromide (bpb) in murine primary
splenocytes. splenocytes (1 ´ 106/ml) were pretreated with bpb
(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 5 lm) or vehicle (0, 0.1% ethanol) for
20 min and then stimulated with phorbol-12- xxxd2681xxx -13-acetate
(pma; 80 nm) plus  xxxd2379xxx  (io; 1 lm). additionally, the basal
level of il-2 secretion was measured in unstimulated cells (na).
supernatants were harvested at 24 h and il-2 was determined by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the data are expressed
as mean  se of triplicate cultures. an asterisk denotes values that
are signi®cantly dierent from vehicle at p<0.05. n.d., il-2 concn.
below the level of quantitation. the results are representative of two
separate experiments

temporal addition studies were performed to evaluate
the temporal relationship between treatment time of
bpb and inhibition of il-2 secretion. bpb inhibited
il-2 secretion in a time-dependent manner (fig. 5). bpb
failed to inhibit il-2 secretion when added to splenocyte
cultures 1 h or later after activation with pma/io.
conversely, robust inhibition of il-2 secretion was observed when splenocytes were treated with bpb at earlier
time points ()20, 0, and 30 min). the result suggest that
bpb interrupts early events of il-2 expression.

discussion
in the present study we demonstrated that pla2 inhibitors bpb and aacocf3 strongly suppressed il-2

expression in murine primary splenocytes. the decrease
in il-2 secretion by pla2 inhibitors was paralleled by a
concomitant decrease in steady-state il-2 mrna expression. moreover, our results suggest that pla2 inhibitors may act by disrupting the early signaling events
leading to the transactivation of the il-2 gene in view of
the fact that treatment of splenocytes with bpb 1 h post
activation failed to inhibit il-2 secretion.
several lines of evidence suggest that pla2 may play
a role in the regulation of il-2 by contributing to the
signal transduction associated with il-2 gene expression.

1. the cd28 signaling cascade has been implicated in
pla2-mediated il-2 expression. this premise is
supported by the fact that  xxxd208xxx  release,
leukotriene b4 production, and formation of cd28-responsive complex (cd28rc) triggered by cd28 ligation
in human primary t lymphocytes are abrogated by
either  xxxd2271xxx , an inhibitor of ptk, or by dexamethasone, an inhibitor of pla2 (los et al. 1995). in
addition, bpb blocks cd28rc formation. as already
described, cd28rc is critically involved in the transcriptional regulation of the il-2 gene.
2. very recently, nf-jb activation induced by tnf
has been observed to be inhibited by aacocf3 and
selective  xxxg1760xxx  inhibitors 12-epi-scalaradial and
ly311727 in human keratinocyte cell line hacat
(thommesen et al. 1998). nf-jb is a critical transcription factor in il-2 gene expression.
3. pkc has also been implicated in pla2-elicited il-2
expression. exogenous  xxxg1760xxx  has been reported to potentiate the activation of human resting t lymphocyte
induced by diacylglycerol and io (asaoka et al. 1993). in
the aforementioned studies, the authors attributed this
eect to  xxxg1760xxx -elicited release of 2-lysophosphatidylcho
line and cis-unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx , which subsequently
enhanced diacylglycerol-dependent activation of pkc.
4. map kinase associated signaling may be involved
in pla2-elicited il-2 expression.  xxxg1760xxx  was found to
activate map kinase activity in both the human astrocytoma cell line 1321n1 (herhandez et al. 1998) and
rat mesangial cells (sugiura et al. 1995). lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) is the proposed mediator response
for this activation though herhandez et al. failed to
show that lpa production was in fact increased in their
human astrocytoma cell line 1321n1 (herhandez et al.
1998). it is feasible that pla2 activates map kinase in
t-cells.

analysis of the results see the legend to fig. 3. determination of il-2

5. ptk has been proposed to be involved in spla2elicited activation of rat mast cells in view of the abolition of the degranulation process by genistein and
 xxxd2271xxx , the inhibitors of ptk (murakami et al.
1993). in addition, pla2 inhibitors, including bpb,
blocked this  xxxg1760xxx -elicited degranulation. this suggests
ptk may also be involved in pla2-mediated il-2 expression since the ptk cascade triggered il-2 transcription.
6. ca2+ signaling may play a role in pla2-mediated
il-2 transcription. aacocf3 was demonstrated to
block mini-glucagon (cooh-terminal fragment of glucagon)-induced  xxxd208xxx  release and [45ca2+]
accumulation into a sarcoplasmic reticulum compartment (sauvadet et al. 1997). exogenous  xxxd208xxx 
mimicked the eect of mini-glucagon on ca2+ homeostasis in embryonic chick heart cells and also potentiated
caeine-induced ca2+ mobilization from intracellular
stores in a dose-dependent manner. additionally,  xxxg1760xxx 
was observed to elicit ca2+ mobilization in the human
astrocytoma cell line 1321n1 (herhandez et al. 1998).
7. pla2-activating protein increased il-1 and tnf
expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(bomalaski et al. 1995). il-1 is a co-stimulator in lymphocyte activation and contributes to the induction of
il-2 gene transcription by induction of nf-jb
(bankers-fulbright et al. 1996).
taken together, the above ®ndings suggest that pla2
products,  xxxd208xxx  and/or lpa, may act as
second messages that signi®cantly in¯uence ptk, map
kinase, pkc, ca2+, and cd28 signaling cascades. all
these signaling pathways in concert are critical for the
regulation of il-2 gene transcription by further activating transcription factors ap-1 (by pkc, map kinase, and ptk), nf-at (by ca2+ signaling; fraser et al.
1993; crabtree and clipstone 1994), and nf-jb
(by cd28 ligation, los et al. 1995).
considering the involvement of il-2 in a wide variety
of immune responses, our ®nding that pla2 inhibitors
suppressed il-2 expression suggest a potentially broader
application of these mediators as immune modulators.
likewise, our results further suggest a potentially important role by pla2 in the regulation of il-2 gene expression. somewhat surprisingly, we observed that both
bpb and aacocf3 inhibited il-2 expression in a similar
manner, suggesting that both  xxxg1760xxx  and  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  are involved in the regulation of il-2 expression. moreover, our
studies suggest that xenobiotics which negatively regulate
pla2, either  xxxg1760xxx  or  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx , are potential immunotoxicants based on the critical role that il-2 plays in t-cell
clonal expansion. equally important, pla2 inhibitors
have been explored as a new group of promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of in¯ammatory diseases
(glaser et al. 1993). it is tempting to speculate that their
eectiveness may, at least in part, be due to their ability to
robustly inhibit il-2 expression and t-cell activity in
addition to blocking in¯ammatory cells and the release of
proin¯ammatory cytokines. the present ®ndings may be
especially important to the clinical application of pla2

inhibitors as these agents may have signi®cantly broader
activity than presently believed and could represent a risk
to patients who are immunocompromised.
