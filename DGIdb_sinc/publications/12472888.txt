abstract
induction of heat shock proteins (hsps) protects cells from
oxidative injury. here hsp72,  xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx  and  xxxg1062xxx 
( xxxg1062xxx ) were induced in cultured rat astrocytes, and protection
against oxidative stress was investigated. astrocytes were
treated with sodium arsenite (20–50 lm) for 1 h, which was
non-toxic to cells, 24 h later they were exposed to 400 lm
h2o2 for 1 h, and cell death was evaluated at different time
points. arsenite triggered strong induction of hsps, which was
prevented by 1 lg/ml cycloheximide (cxh). h2o2 caused cell
loss and increased cell death with features of apoptosis, i.e.
tdt-mediated dutp nick-end labelling (tunel) reaction and
caspase-3 activation. these features were abrogated by pretreatment with arsenite, which prevented cell loss and significantly reduced the number of dead cells. the protective

effect of arsenite was not detected in the presence of chx.
pre-treatment with arsenite increased  xxxg118xxx  (akt)
and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2) phosphorylation after h2o2. however, while akt phosphorylation
was prevented by chx,  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation was further
enhanced by chx. the results show that transient arsenite
pre-treatment induces hsp72,  xxxg1062xxx  and, to a lesser extent,
 xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx ; it reduces h2o2-induced astrocyte death; and it causes selective activation of akt following h2o2. it is suggested
that hsp expression at the time of h2o2 exposure protects
astrocytes from oxidative injury and apoptotic cell death by
means of pro-survival akt.

the 72-kda heat shock protein (hsp72) is a stress-inducible
protein that belongs to the hsp70 chaperone family. hsp72
shows very low expression in brain under physiological
conditions, but it is induced after certain insults such as
ischaemia (sharp et al. 1991, 1999; simon et al. 1991;
liu et al. 1993; massa et al. 1996; planas et al. 1997;
torregrosa et al. 2001) or kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity
(armstrong et al. 1996; planas et al. 1994, 1995). in vivo,
hsp72 is strongly induced in neurones after lesions, although
other neural cells can also express hsp72 depending on the
severity of the insult. indeed, astrocytes (li et al. 1992;
kinouchi et al. 1993), microglia (soriano et al. 1994) and
endothelium (li et al. 1992; kinouchi et al. 1993) also
express hsp72. however, in cell cultures, astrocytes are more
prone to express hsp72 after heat shock than neurones are, as
hippocampal neurones appear to be deﬁcient in heat shock
transcription factor-1 (marcuccilli et al. 1996), and cortical
neurones show delayed and weaker induction of hsp72

compared to astrocytes (nishimura et al. 1991; nishimura
and dwyer 1996). astrocytes in culture express hsp72 in
response to re-oxygenation after hypoxia, and this is taken as
a protective mechanism against deterioration of cellular

hsps and tolerance to injury in astrocytes 1339

energy metabolism (imuta et al. 1998). although hsp72 is
regarded as a protective molecule against cell death (plumier
et al. 1997; sharp et al. 1999; rajdev et al. 2000; hoehn
et al. 2001), it does not invariably prevent cell death in
neural cells (planas et al. 1997; lee et al. 2001). induction
of hsp72 under stress conditions is often accompanied by the
induction of proteins of other heat shock stress families. for
instance,  xxxg1062xxx  ( xxxg1062xxx ), an inducible 32-kda
hsp with antioxidant properties as it degrades pro-oxidant
heme, is induced after ischaemia (nimura et al. 1996) and
 xxxg1062xxx  overexpression in transgenic mice is protective against
ischaemic damage (panahian et al. 1999). also, ischaemia
induces  xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx  in astrocytes, but evidence does not support a
major role for this protein in the phenomenon of tolerance
(kato et al. 1995).
pre-conditioning with a short non-lethal episode of
ischaemia in rodents protects against more severe ischaemia,
and thus induces a certain degree of tolerance (kirino et al.
1991; glazier et al. 1994). in addition, other conditions such
as hyperthermia (kitagawa et al. 1991) and cortical spreading depression (kobayashi et al. 1995) have also been
reported to have a pre-conditioning effect and induce
tolerance to ischaemia. the study of ischaemic pre-conditioning is important for various clinical conditions, such as
organ transplantation to preserve against reperfusion injury
(yin et al. 1998). indeed, overexpression of hsp72 protects
mechanical and endothelial function in a clinically relevant
donor heart preservation protocol (jayakumar et al. 2000).
although the clinical relevance of pre-conditioning in brain
is less obvious than in other organs, it is important to
understand the molecular mechanism underlying cerebral
ischaemic tolerance. also, a certain tolerance to ischaemia in
patients suffering from transient ischaemic attacks (tia)
would be expected if the phenomenon of ischaemic tolerance
in brain, which is well documented in experimental animals,
would also occur in man. yet, the mechanism underlying
induction of cerebral ischaemic tolerance is not well
understood. while a number of reports suggest that hsp72
is involved in this process (liu et al. 1993; nishi et al. 1993;
plumier et al. 1997), robust results support that a certain
degree of tolerance also occurs in the absence of hsp72 (abe
and nowak 1996, 2000; chen et al. 1996; pringle et al.
1999; currie et al. 2000). for instance, ischaemic tolerance
is observed in spite of the fact that hsp72 mrna is not
induced in the hippocampus of the gerbil in global ischaemia
(abe and nowak 1996, 2000), and in a focal ischaemia
model in the rat (chen et al. 1996). also, it appears that
hsp72 overexpression does not protect against all kinds of
injuries, as it has no effect in an in vivo model of permanent
focal ischaemia in mice or in cortical neurones subjected to
oxygen–glucose deprivation and glutamate toxicity, whereas
it does protect hippocampal neurones against the same insults
and astrocytes against h2o2 (lee et al. 2001). this selective
protective action of hsp72 has been attributed to the nature

and severity of the insults, as well as to the kind of cells
affected (lee et al. 2001).
h2o2 is a reactive oxygen species (ros) that causes
toxicity to cells and induces cell death. the production of
ros has been involved in different pathologies of brain. for
instance, ros are generated in the re-oxygenation phase
after ischaemia and contribute to reperfusion injury. astrocytes protect neurones against the toxicity of h2o2 (desagher
et al. 1996) and they play a role in the detoxiﬁcation of ros
(raps et al. 1989; wilson 1997). in the present work we
tested whether chemical induction of hsps (hsp72,  xxxg1062xxx 
and  xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx ) in cultured astrocytes was protective against
h2o2-induced oxidative stress insult that was applied 24 h
later, and we examined how treatments changed intracellular
signalling pathways involving  xxxg118xxx  (akt) and
extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2).

materials and methods
preparation of primary astrocytes cultures
cultured astrocytes were prepared from the cerebral cortex of 1- to
2-day-old sprague–dawley rats (iffa-credo, l’arbresle, france) as
described previously (juurlink et al. 1992), with slight modiﬁcations. brieﬂy, for each culture 10 pups were decapitated, their brains
aseptically removed, then placed on ice in sterile culture dishes
containing phosphate-buffered saline (pbs; nah2po4 and k2hpo4
10 mm ph 7.4 in isotonic nacl solution). the midbrain, meninges
and blood vessels were removed by dissection. the remaining
cerebral cortices were mechanically dissociated by pipetting for
2 min with a pasteur pipette in 6 ml of dmem (dulbecco’s
modiﬁed eagle medium, gibco-brl, invitrogen, paisley, uk)
containing 4 ml/l of a mixture of penicillin/streptomycin
10 000 u/10 000 lg/ml (gibco-brl). the suspension was ﬁltered
through a 70-lm pore size nylon mesh cell strainer (becton and
dickinson, franklin lakes, nj, usa). then, the cells were plated in
14 ﬂasks (25 cm2, tpp, techno plastic products, trasadingen,
switzerland) and maintained in dmem supplemented with 20%
fetal bovine serum (fbs; gibco-brl) at 37c in an humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 5% co2)95% air. the culture medium was changed
three times a week with the incubation medium supplemented with
20%, then 15% fbs. after 1 week, the ﬂasks were shaken at
1 200 rpm (orbital shaker so3; stuart scientiﬁc, afora, barcelona,
spain) for 2 h to dislodge microglia. the medium was immediately
removed and replaced with a fresh medium containing 15% fbs.
then, up to conﬂuence, the culture medium was used with 10%
fbs.
experimental design and treatments
astrocytes were exposed to different concentrations of sodium
arsenite, naaso2 (20, 35, 50, 100 and 200 lm) for different times
(30 min, 2 h and 6 h) to test whether this chemical induced a heat
shock stress response in astrocytes. on the basis of these results we
decided to carry a transient exposure to 20 and 50 lm arsenite for
1 h, then cells were washed and expression of hsps was studied at 6
and 24 h. independently, we tested different concentrations of h2o2
and exposure times and decided to use 400 lm for 1 h, which

 2002 international society for neurochemistry, journal of neurochemistry, 83, 1338–1348

1340 b. fauconneau et al.

caused about 30% of death cells 24 h later. thirty minutes following
1-h exposure to h2o2, and in the corresponding controls, cells were
harvested to study the phosphorylation of akt and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in the
different treatment groups by western blot.
cell viability assay
we estimated the total number of cells and the percentage of h2o2induced dead cells by trypan blue dye exclusion assay at several
time points later (from 2 h to 48 h). stained (taken as dead) and
viable non-stained cells were counted in a hemocytometer. we then
tested whether 1-h exposure to arsenite (20 and 50 lm) 24 h prior to
h2o2 exerted any protective effect on astrocytes as evaluated 24 and
48 h later, and whether the response was altered by treatment with
1 lg/ml cycloheximide (chx) that was added to the medium after
arsenite exposure, and was withdrawn prior to h2o2 exposure. for
each treatment group the percentage of cell death was expressed as
the number of stained cells versus total counted cells. mean values
for each group were obtained from six independent experiments.
release of lactate dehydrogenase
cell death was quantiﬁed 48 h after the lesion by measuring the
activity of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) released in the medium
according to a modiﬁcation of the method of wroblewski and
2 ladue (1955). brieﬂy, the decrease in 0.75 mm nadh absorbance
at 340 nm was followed in a phosphate buffer (50 mm, ph 7.4) in
presence of 4.2 mm  xxxd3055xxx  as substrate. serial dilutions of
medium from 0.2% triton x-100 lysed cells were used to construct
a standard curve, and cell death was expressed as the percentage of
maximal death.
evaluation of cell death by flow cytometry
with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide staining
apoptosis was assessed by measurement of dna content. cells
were permeabilized with 0.1% triton x-100 and immediately
incubated with 50 lg/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi) for 30 min at
room temperature. flow cytometric experiments were carried out
using an epics xl ﬂow cytometer (coulter corporation, hialeah,
fl, usa). the instrumet was set up with the standard conﬁguration: excitation of the sample was done using a standard 488 nm
air-cooled argon-ion laser at 15mw power. forward scatter (fsc),
side scatter (ssc) and red (620 nm) ﬂuorescence for pi were
adquired. optical alignement was based on optimized signal from
10 nm ﬂuorescent beads (flow-check; beckman coulter, miami,
3 fl, usa). time was used as a control of the stability of the
instrument. red ﬂuorescence was projected on a 1024 monoparametrical histogram. agregates were excluded gating single cells
by their area versus peak ﬂuorescence signal. dna analysis
(ploidy analysis) on single ﬂuorescence histograms was done using
multicycle software (phoenix flow systems, san diego, ca,
usa). about 15000 nuclei were analysed in each treatment
condition. the presence of a sub-g0/g1 peak is indicative of
fragmented dna in apoptotic cells.
tunel labelling assay
after treatments (15 h after h2o2) cells were ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde. the presence of fragmented dna was revealed
by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nickend labelling (tunel) assay using the apoptosis detection

system, fluorescein (promega, madison, wi, usa) following the
instructions of the manufacturer. the assay measures the fragmented dna of apoptotic cells by catalytically incorporating ﬂuorescein-12-dutp at-3¢-oh dna ends using the enzyme tdt, which
forms a polymeric tail using the principle of the tunel assay.
the ﬂuorescein-12-utp-labelled dna of the astrocytes ﬁxed in
culture chamber was visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy. nonapoptotic nuclei were counterstained with pi. we used a positive
control of astrocytes 13 h after  xxxd3241xxx  treatment (0.3 lm for
2 h).
caspase-3 activity
activation of caspase-3 was determined with the kit caspatagtm
(intergen co., purchase, ny, usa) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. dissociated astrocytes were incubated with a carboxyﬂuorescein (fam) analogue of benzyloxycarbonyl-aspartylglutamylvalylaspartic acid ﬂuoromethyl ketone (zdevd-fmk).
zdevd-fmk is a potent inhibitor of caspase-3 and caspase-3-like
caspases. fam-devd-fmk enters the cell and irreversibly binds to
activated caspase-3. after incubation with fam-devd-fmk,
astrocytes were ﬁxed and analysed by ﬂow cytometry in the ﬂow
cytometer.
immunocytochemistry
for studies of immunocytochemistry, astrocytes were cultured in
4 8-well plastic slides (nunc, roskilde, denmark). cells were ﬁxed
with cold methanol for 10 min, washed three times with pbs and
incubated for 1 h with the blocking solution containing 3% normal
goat serum. the primary antibody, a rabbit polyclonal antibody
raised against 17-kda cleaved caspase-3, which is the active form
of this enzyme (cell signaling, beverly, ma, usa) diluted
1 : 100, was incubated overnight at 4c in the presence of 1%
normal goat serum, followed by a red ﬂuorescent tritc-labelled
secondary antibody (sigma, st louis, mo, usa) that was
incubated for 1 h at room temperature diluted 1 : 200 also with
1% normal goat serum. after this, cells were washed with pbs and
were mounted with a mounting media (mowiol, calbiochem, san
diego, ca, usa).
western blot
samples were homogenized in ripa buffer, containing 0.01 m
pbs, sodium  xxxd3215xxx , sodium  xxxd1835xxx  the non-ionic
detergent igepal and complete, the protease inhibitor cocktail
(boehringer mannheim, mannheim, germany), as reported (justicia
et al. 2000). all products and reagents, unless otherwise stated,
were from sigma. samples were kept on ice for 30 min and then
centrifuged at 12 000 g at 4c for 15 min, and the supernatants
were used as the protein fraction. the protein concentration was
determined with the bradford assay (bio-rad, hercules, ca,
usa), and 20 lg of the protein extracts were denatured at 100c
for 5 min and then loaded in a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel.
proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membrane (immobilon-p, millipore, bedford, ma, usa), which
was incubated overnight at 4c with mouse monoclonal antibodies
directed against either hsp-72 (oncogene, eugene, or, usa)
diluted 1 : 1000,  xxxg1062xxx  (stressgen, collegeville, pa, usa) diluted
1 : 16 000, or phosphorylated  xxxd1355xxx /42 mapk (p- xxxg1369xxx /2; cell

 xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx  (stressgen) diluted 1 : 16000, or phosphorylated akt
(p-akt at ser473; cell signaling) diluted 1 : 500. on the following
day membranes were incubated for 1 h with ig peroxidase-linked
secondary antibodies (1 : 2000) (amersham, piscataway, nj, usa).
the reaction was visualized using a chemiluminiscence detection
system based on the luminol reaction. a mouse monoclonal
antibody against b-tubulin (boehringer mannheim) 1 : 10 000
was used as marker for protein gel loading. densitometric analysis
was carried out by measuring mean band intensity using an
appropriate software (kodak digital science 1d, kodak, rochester,
ny, usa). the ratio between these measures and that for the
corresponding b-tubulin was taken for each sample to normalize for
any differences in gel loading. the percentage value of treated in
relation to controls was calculated for samples in each gel. mean
values were from three independent experiments.
data analysis
statistical analysis of data to compare the different treatment groups
studied was carried out using one-way anova. group differences
were tested post-hoc with the bonferroni’s test.

results

arsenite induced the expression of hsp72,  xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx 
and  xxxg1062xxx 
one-hour exposure to 50 lm arsenite caused strong induction
of hsp72 that was already detected after 2 h (not shown), and
increased at 6 h and 24 h (fig. 1). arsenite-dependent induction of hsp72 was prevented by chx that was added to the
medium immediately after 1-h exposure to arsenite (fig. 1).
anova showed signiﬁcant differences between groups
(p < 0.0001), and the bonferroni’s post-hoc test showed that
band intensity in the groups treated with arsenite alone was
signiﬁcantly higher than in untreated controls (p < 0.001) and
than the group co-treated with chx (p < 0.001), which was
not different from control (fig. 1b). a more moderate increase
was observed for  xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx  (fig. 1), which was signiﬁcantly
above control at 24 h (p < 0.05). expression of  xxxg1062xxx  protein
was also induced by arsenite (fig. 2; p < 0.001) and this was
prevented by treatment with chx (figs 2a and b). in a set of

experiments we tested whether exposure to a lower dose of
arsenite (20 lm) for 1 h also induced the expression of hsps
24 h later. hsp72 was only very mildly induced by 20 lm
arsenite compared to 50 lm (figs 2c and d), while  xxxg1062xxx  was
already induced by 20 lm arsenite to a degree slightly below
that induced by 50 lm (figs 2c and e).

of stained dead cells increased from 12% basal to 35% at
24 h after h2o2 exposure, and this was reduced by arsenite
to about 17% (fig. 4c). treatment with arsenite alone caused
no increase in cell death versus controls (fig. 4c). the
protective effect of arsenite persisted at 48 h after h2o2, as
revealed by trypan blue assay (fig. 4e), and by release of
ldh at this time (fig. 4f).

h2o2-induced cell death
exposure of astrocyte cultures to 400 lm h2o2 for 1 h
increased the percentage of dead cells stained positive with
the trypan blue dye exclusion assay from 2 h to 24 h, and
consequently total cell number in the cultures was progressively decreased (fig. 3a). the time course of cell death was
also followed by ﬂow cytometry by staining the living cells
with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide at 0, 3, 6, 15 and 24 h after h2o2
exposure (fig. 3b). the analysis showed the presence of a
subg0/g1 peak of cells bearing fragmented dna compatible
with apoptosis at 6, 15 h and 24 h after h2o2 exposure.

chx abolished the protective effect of arsenite
cells were treated with chx after 1 h exposure to arsenite.
chx was withdrawn 24 h later, before addition of h2o2 and
cell death was examined after 24 h more. the protective
effect of arsenite pre-treatment on h2o2-induced cell death
was no longer detected after exposure to chx (fig. 4d),
which prevented hsps induction (see above, figs 1 and 2).
also chx did not promote cell death both in the absence
(14% cell death), and in the presence of arsenite (16% cell
death) in relation with non-treated controls (12% cell death).

transient exposure to arsenite 1-day before h2o2
reduced cell death
arsenite pre-treatment signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) prevented the
decrease in total cell number at 24 h in the cultures treated
with h2o2 (fig. 4a), promoted cell survival (fig. 4b), and
decreased the percentage of dead cells staining positive with
the trypan blue dye exclusion assay (fig. 4c). the percentage

h2o2-induced tunel-positive staining was abrogated
by arsenite
evidence supporting that h2o2 induced apoptotic cell death
was also obtained from the positive tunel staining that was
found 15 h after exposure to h2o2 (fig. 5d). pre-treatment
with 50 lm arsenite abrogated h2o2-induced dna fragmentation (fig. 5e).

(b) apoptosis is assessed by measurement of dna content ( xxxd3027xxx 
iodide staining; n ¼ 2 samples per time point, results from one
experiment are shown). the presence of a sub-g0/g1 peak at 6, 15
and 24 h is indicative of fragmented dna in apoptotic cells.

h2o2-induced apoptosis was mediated by caspase-3
activation, which was prevented by arsenite
active caspase-3 was detected by means of immunocytochemistry with speciﬁc antibodies (see methods) in astrocyte cultures at 24 h after 1 h exposure to h2o2 (fig. 6c).
no signal was observed in controls (fig. 6a). immunoreaction for caspase-3 was strongly attenuated by
pre-treatment with 50 lm arsenite the day before exposure
to h2o2 (fig. 6e).
fluorescence linked to caspase-3 activation (fig. 7) was
clearly increased (p < 0.001) in the group treated with h2o2
in relation to controls. caspase-3 activation by h2o2 was
inhibited (p < 0.001) by pre-treatment with 50 lm arsenite,
while arsenite alone had no effect on caspase-3.

activation of signal transduction pathways following
h2o2-treatment
at 30 min after 1 h exposure to h2o2 we analysed the
phosphorylation of akt and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in the different experimental groups (fig. 8). akt was phosphorylated at ser473
in response to certain treatments (p < 0.005). a slight
tendency for p-akt (ser473) to increase was observed
following h2o2, but the effect was not signiﬁcantly
different from control at this early time point after exposure.
however, a signiﬁcant increase (p < 0.05) in akt phosphorylation was detected after treatment with h2o2 in
cultures that were pre-treated with 50 lm arsenite for 1 h
the previous day. those cells expressed hsps at the time of
h2o2 exposure (figs 1 and 2) and they were protected
against the toxicity of h2o2 (fig. 4). yet, exposure of cells
to chx after arsenite treatment and prior to treatment with
h2o2, prevented the phosphorylation of akt (p < 0.05 vs.
the group treated with arsenite + h2o2).
phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx  (p < 0.001) and  xxxg1366xxx 
(p < 0.001) was detected following treatments. h2o2
(fig. 8a) tended to increase the phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx 
and this increase was greater in the cells pre-treated with
50 lm arsenite (p < 0.01), which in addition showed
increased phosphorylation of  xxxg1366xxx  (p < 0.001; fig. 8b). in
contrast to the phosphorylation of akt that was prevented by
chx pre-treatment in the group receiving arsenite prior to
h2o2, phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  was strongly
enhanced (p < 0.001) in this group also receiving chx.
furthermore, the relationship between phosphorylation of
 xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  changed with the treatments (p < 0.02;
fig. 9). indeed, the ratio of p- xxxg1369xxx  to p- xxxg1366xxx  increased after
h2o2 (p < 0.05) in relation to controls. this h2o2-related
effect in relation to controls was not observed in the groups
pre-treated with arsenite, and chx did not reverse the effect
of arsenite (fig. 9). thus, h2o2 caused preferential phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx  than  xxxg1366xxx , whereas cells pre-treated with
arsenite showed and even greater phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx 
that was accompanied with  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation. as shown
above (fig. 8), additional treatment with chx further
enhanced phosphorylation of the both, although, comparatively, the increase of p- xxxg1366xxx  was even higher than that of
p- xxxg1369xxx  (fig. 9).
discussion

we report reduction of h2o2-induced cell death in astrocyte
cell culture by transient pre-treatment with arsenite, and this
effect was prevented by treatment with chx after arsenite
prior to the oxidative stress. arsenite induced hsps in
astrocytes and chx also prevented this induction. then
hsps were expressed at the time of h2o2 exposure in the
cultures that showed some tolerance to h2o2-induced cell
death. these results suggest that hsps reduced damage

fig. 4 arsenite pre-treatment protects against h2o2-induced cell
death, as assessed with the trypan blue dye exclusion assay at 24 h
(a–d) and 48 h (e), and by ldh leakage at 48 h (f). (a) one-hour
treatment with 400 lm h2o2 induces cell death, and subsequently
total cell number decreases. this effect is prevented by arsenite (as)
at the dose of 50 lm but not at 20 lm. (b) the number of living cells
(non-stained with trypan blue) is reduced by h2o2, and this is significantly prevented by 50 lm as. (c) the percentage of cell death
(stained cells) increases by h2o2, and this is prevented by 20 and
50 lm arsenite (n ¼ 12 samples per treatment, from five independent experiments). (d) effect of 1 lg/ml cycloheximide (chx). h2o2
induces cell death 24 h later, which is reduced by pre-treatment with
arsenite. chx is added to the medium after arsenite withdrawal, i.e

24 h prior to h2o2 exposure. chx prevents the protective effect of
arsenite on h2o2-induced cell death, but on its own has no effect on
h2o2-induced cell death. chx is not toxic in cells treated with
arsenite or controls not receiving h2o2. n ¼ 4 samples, from two
independent experiments. (e) per cent cell death at 48 h by trypan
blue staining shows that the protective effect of as against h2o2induced cell death is maintained at this time (n ¼ 4 samples per
treatment). (f) leakage of ldh at 48 h corroborates the former
observation (n ¼ 4 samples per treatment). values are expressed as
mean ± sem. (a–c,e,f) versus *control and versus &h2o2; (d) versus *h2o2 and versus &as + h2o2, versus #as + h2o2 + chx,

under oxidative stress conditions. arsenite induces the
expression of hsp72 in several cells such as in human
colorectal carcinoma cells (chen et al. 2001), causes acquisition of thermotolerance in hela s3 cells (kampinga et al.
1992), and inhibits cell death in rat kidney with ischaemia–
reperfusion or cyclosporine-induced injuries (yang et al.
2001). besides hsp72, arsenite induces several other stress
proteins, such as  xxxg1062xxx  and  xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx , amongst others (del razo
et al. 2001). while hsp72 is not regarded as a major
contributor to the phenomenon of ischaemic tolerance (kato
et al. 1995), several lines of evidence support the view that
 xxxg1062xxx  promotes the activation of cellular defence mechanisms and it is protective against ischaemia (nimura et al.
1996; panahian et al. 1999). in agreement with these
observations, here we found strong induction of  xxxg1062xxx  in
astrocytes by arsenite, while only a very minor and
comparatively delayed induction of  xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx  was detected.
thus our results are compatible with a protective effect of
hsp72 and  xxxg1062xxx  against oxidative stress.

oxygen free radicals cause a variety of disturbances in the
cells such as membrane lipid peroxidation (su et al. 1999)
and inhibition of glutamate uptake in rat cortical astrocytes
(volterra et al. 1994), amongst others. h2o2-exposure can
cause apoptosis, as it occurs for instance in glial cells
(kitamura et al. 1999) and in a human neuroblastoma cell
line (sonoda et al. 1999). here we observed tunelpositive reaction and activation of caspase-3 in astrocytes
following exposure to h2o2, in agreement with previous
ﬁndings in hl-60 cells (dipietrantonio et al. 1999).
caspase-3 is a common mediator of proteolysis in the
apoptotic process of cell death (mancini et al. 1998). here
the death of most astrocytes following exposure to h2o2 was
mediated through a caspase-3-dependent apoptotic mechanism, which was prevented by arsenite pre-treatment, indicating that the apoptotic process was blocked at the time of
hsp expression. our present results further support previous
ﬁndings showing that hsp72 confers protection against
h2o2-induced oxidative stress in various cell types (chong

et al. 2001), and that protection is mediated by inhibition of
apoptosis (creagh et al. 2000).
tolerance appears to be a multifactorial phenomenon that
relies on particular survival pathways. in the present study,
pre-treatment with arsenite 24 h before 1 h exposure to
h2o2 selectively caused phosphorylation of akt at ser473
30 min after h2o2. this effect might be involved in the
protective action of arsenite pre-treatment against h2o2induced cell death, as activation of akt is known to
promote cell survival (songyang et al. 1997; wang et al.
2000). h2o2 promotes activation of akt in glia (sonoda
et al. 1999; salsman et al. 2001). here we observed that
chx prevented the effect of arsenite on h2o2-induced akt
activation, in agreement with previous data showing that
chx abolishes arsenite-induced thermotolerance in hela
s3 cells (kampinga et al. 1992). these ﬁndings suggest
that hsps is involved in the sustained phosphorylation of
akt after h2o2 exposure, and that this pathway mediates
cell survival. in fact, heat shock has been reported to
activate akt through  xxxg1743xxx -kinase-dependent (shaw et al.
1998; konishi et al. 1999) and -independent (konishi et al.
1999) mechanisms, whereas h2o2-induced akt activation
was fully mediated by  xxxg1743xxx -kinase (shaw et al. 1998;
konishi et al. 1999), thus indicating that the two stressors

caused akt activation through different pathways (konishi
et al. 1999).
h2o2 induces  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation ( xxxg1369xxx  more than
 xxxg1366xxx ) in astrocytes through a mechanism probably involving  xxxd208xxx  and/or its metabolites (tournier
et al. 1997). here, arsenite pre-treatment further enhanced
the phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 after h2o2-exposure. moreover, astrocyte cultures receiving chx, in addition to
arsenite and h2o2, showed an even stronger activation of
erk, and the extent of phosphorylation of  xxxg1366xxx  was
similar to that of  xxxg1369xxx , suggesting that the molecular
mechanism underlying erk activation under the various
agents administered was different. while erk activation
might be a survival signal in astrocytes under certain
conditions (takuma et al. 2000), the present results
suggest that this pathway is not responsible for

arsenite-induced protection against h2o2 toxicity as the
signal was very high after chx treatment, which
abolished the protective effect induced by arsenite.
in brief, we show that the damage derived from exposure
of cultured astrocytes to h2o2 is reduced by transient
arsenite pre-treatment. arsenite pre-treatment induced
expression of hsps at the time of exposure to h2o2 and it
enhanced akt activation after h2o2-exposure. these results
give further evidence supporting that hsps (hsp72,  xxxg1062xxx 
and, to a lesser extent,  xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx ) reduce astrocyte apoptotic
cell death under h2o2-mediated oxidative stress and suggest
