of activating  xxxg1807xxx  is 15-deoxy-d 12,14- xxxd1209xxx  2 . d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2
.  xxxd1209xxx  2 @ pgd 2. these results indicate that  xxxd1209xxx ’s are
not only anti-tumor agents but also play important
physiological roles since pgd 2, a  xxxd1209xxx  2 precursor, is the
most abundant pg in the cns (18). pgd 2 is now wellknown as a sleep inducer in mammalian brain (19), but
the neuronal effects of  xxxd1209xxx ’s are not clear. thus we
addressed the question as to what biological function
 xxxd1209xxx ’s possess in neuronal cells. since pc12 cells serve
as a useful model system for the study of neurite outgrowth (20), we used this system to test the neuronal
function of  xxxd1209xxx ’s.

although a- and j-type prostaglandins (pg’s) arrest
the cell cycle at the g 1 phase in vitro and suppress
tumor growth in vivo, their effects on neuronal cells
have not so far been clarified. here, we found promotion of neurite outgrowth as a novel biological function of  xxxd1209xxx ’s. in pc12h cells,  xxxd1209xxx ’s ( xxxd1209xxx  2, d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2
and 15-deoxy-d 12,14- xxxd1209xxx  2 ) promoted neurite outgrowth
in the presence of  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf), whereas
they themselves did not show such a promotion. the
potency of promoting neurite outgrowth was  xxxd1209xxx  2 <
d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2 < 15-deoxy-d 12,14- xxxd1209xxx  2. however, troglitazone,
an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorg ( xxxg1807xxx ), and other pg’s including pga 1,
pga 2 and pgd 2 did not promote neurite outgrowth.
these results suggest that  xxxd1209xxx ’s promote neurite outgrowth independently of  xxxg1807xxx  activation. © 1999

materials and methods
materials. ngf (2.5s) was purchased from chemicon international. pgs (pga 1, pga 2, pgd 2,  xxxd1209xxx  2, d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2 and 15-deoxy-d 12,14pgj 2) (fig. 1) were obtained from cayman chemical. troglitazone
was a generous gift from sankyo co. these compounds were diluted
in ethanol. the final concentration of ethanol was 0.1% and this
concentration did not affect neurite outgrowth or cell survival.

cell cultures. pc12h cells, a subline of pc12 cells, were maintained in 75 cm 2 flasks (costar) containing 1:1 mixture of dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium and f12 medium supplemented with 5%
(v/v) of heat-inactivated (56°c, 30 min) horse serum (gibco) and 5%
(v/v) of precolostrum newborn calf serum (mitsubishi kasei) (5/5 df).
for evaluation of neurite outgrowth, the cells were transferred to
collagen-coated 24 well plates (costar) at a density of 1x10 4 cells/cm 2
and incubated in 5/5 df for 3 h. the medium was changed to
serum-free df, and the cells were incubated for 1 h, after which pg’s
were added. thirty minutes later ngf (50 ng/ml) was added. the
cells were then incubated for 24 h, and neurite (.10 mm)-bearing
cells per total cells (around 70 –100) in the same area were counted.

cyclopentenone pg’s such as d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2 and pga 2
reportedly inhibit cell proliferation and induce various
biological activities including anti-viral activity and
osteogenesis (1, 2). these pg’s have no cell-surface
receptors but are actively transported into cells and
accumulate in nuclei (3–5). although their nuclear
receptor remains unclear, they induce a variety of
genes such as p21  xxxg418xxx /cip (6 – 8), p53 (9), c-fos (10), heme
oxygenase-1 (11), hsp70 (12), igf-1 (13), e-cadherin
(14) and bip/ xxxg1101xxx  (15). recently,  xxxd1209xxx ’s (fig. 1) were
identified as natural ligands for  xxxg1807xxx  and found to
promote adipocyte differentiation (16, 17). the potency

is sequentially metabolized to  xxxd1209xxx  2, d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2, and 15deoxy-d 12,14- xxxd1209xxx  2 (2, 16, 17).  xxxd1209xxx ’s promoted neurite
outgrowth induced by ngf (50 ng/ml) in pc12h cells
(fig. 2). the potency of promoting neurite outgrowth
was 15-deoxy-d 12,14- xxxd1209xxx  2 . d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2 .  xxxd1209xxx  2 @ pgd 2
(fig. 3), indicating a gain in biological potency as the
catabolism of pgd 2 proceeds. since  xxxd1209xxx  2 is easily converted to d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2, the activity of  xxxd1209xxx  2 may be mediated by d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2. if it is the case, the dienone structure
of 15-deoxy-d 12,14- xxxd1209xxx  2 and d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2 may be critical for
promoting neurite outgrowth. the effective concentrations were 0.1–1.0 mm (fig. 3), which were about ten
times lower than those required for growth arrest and
induction of various genes (6 –15). although the function of  xxxd1209xxx ’s in the brain is not clear yet, our results
suggest that promoting neurite outgrowth is an intrinsic biological activity of  xxxd1209xxx ’s in neurons.
forman et al. (16) and kliewer et al. (17) reported
that pgd 2 metabolites bind and activate  xxxg1807xxx  and
promote adipocyte differentiation, indicating that they
are critical regulators of the generation of adipocyte in
vivo. the potency of activating  xxxg1807xxx  is 15-deoxy-

(50 ng/ml) for 24 hours induced neurite formation only
slightly (fig. 2c) since several days are required for
neurite outgrowth in response to ngf. the presence of
both 15-deoxy-d 12,14- xxxd1209xxx  2 and ngf potently promoted
neurite outgrowth (fig. 2d). we also examined the
effects of  xxxd1209xxx ’s, pga’s, pgd 2 and troglitazone, an activator of  xxxg1807xxx  (fig. 3). troglitazone, pga 1, pga 2
and pgd 2 did not promote neurite outgrowth at 0.1–
5.0 mm, whereas  xxxd1209xxx  2, d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2, and 15-deoxy-d 12,14pgj 2 did promote the outgrowth. the potency of promoting neurite outgrowth was 15-deoxy-d 12,14- xxxd1209xxx  2 .
d 12- xxxd1209xxx  2 .  xxxd1209xxx  2 @ pgd 2. the promotion was observed
within 48 hours, indicating that they only accelerated
the speed of neurite outgrowth. since higher concentrations (.0.5 mm 15-deoxy-d 12,14- xxxd1209xxx  2; .2.0 mm d 12pgj 2 and  xxxd1209xxx  2) induced cell damage, we could not
count the number of neurite-bearing cells in cultures
containing these high concentrations of pg’s.

df in the absence (a and b) or in the presence of ngf (50 ng/ml) (c and d) for 24 h. in (b) and (d), 15-deoxy-d 12,14- xxxd1209xxx  2 (0.5 mm) was added

order is the same as that in the promotion of neurite
outgrowth in the present study, suggesting that they
induce the activity through  xxxg1807xxx  activation. however, the expression of  xxxg1807xxx  is highly specific to
adipotissue (21), suggesting that pc12 cells do not
express it. in addition, troglitazone, an activator of
 xxxg1807xxx , did not promote neurite outgrowth up to 10
mm (fig. 3), indicating that  xxxg1807xxx  activation is not
involved in the promotion of neurite outgrowth. it remains unclear yet as to what signaling pathway
is required for the promotion of neurite outgrowth.
 xxxd1209xxx ’s modulate expression of various genes, one of
which may be essential for the promotion of neurite
outgrowth in pc12 cells. one possible candidate is
p21  xxxg418xxx / xxxg418xxx , because the overexpression of this gene
reportedly accelerated neuronal differentiation in
pc12 cells (22). otherwise,  xxxd1209xxx ’s may activate map
kinase activity, which is critical for neuronal differentiation in pc12h cells (23).

in conclusion, we found that  xxxd1209xxx ’s promoted neurite

possibility that  xxxd1209xxx ’s are critical regulators of neurite
outgrowth or regeneration in the nervous system.
