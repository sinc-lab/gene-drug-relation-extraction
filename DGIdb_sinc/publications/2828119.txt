received 28 october 1987; revised version received 2 december 1987
the role of the by-subunits in the interaction of g-proteins was examined with /i,-adrenoceptors
purified from turkey
erythrocytes
and pure by-subunits prepared from turkey erythrocytes
and bovine brain. on a non-denaturing
polyacrylamide gel, the mobility of by-subunits was increased when incubated with /?,-adrenoceptor
and the /?,-adrenergic
agonist
i-( -)- xxxd2401xxx ,
whereas on incubation
with the antagonist
i- xxxd123xxx  the mobility was unchanged.
furthermore,
the /i,-adrenoceptor
was retarded on a sephadex g-50 column equilibrated
with by-subunits and agonist. no retardation
occurred in the presence of antagonist.
these data suggest a direct interaction of activated &-adrenoceptors
with isolated
j?y-subunits of g-proteins.

1. introduction

a family of gtp-binding
proteins function
as
transducers
in signal transfer from hormone receptors to adenylyl cyclase [l] and other targets [2].
these g-proteins are all heterotrimers with asubunits of 39 to 45 kda which bind gtp and are
substrates for toxins, such as cholera toxin and/or
pertussis toxin, and& and y-subunits which do not
bind gtp. the b-subunits have molecular masses

of 35 or 36 kda depending on the source of gprotsin [3,4], whereas the y-subunits are more
heterogeneous
with molecular masses ranging
from 5 to 10 kda [5]. only recently, detailed
studies were carried out with separate and pure
components in reconstituted lipid vesicles to clarify
the role of the fly-subunits in signal transmission
from p-adrenoceptors
to adenylyl cyclase [6-81.
the results may be summarized as follows: the flysubunits are obligatorily
required for adpribosylation of g,, gi and g, which are all pertussis toxin substrates
[9]. the &subunits
stimulate the mg’+-dependent binding of gtpys
to g,, gi and g,. addition of a molar excess of
fly-subunits promotes deactivation of (aif&activated g, [lo], but most significant is an
attenuation of basal, e.g. gtp or gtpys (nonhormonally) activated adenylyl cyclase by flysubunits [6,11]. an anchor role was also ascribed
to the y-subunit for insertion of g-proteins into
the membrane [12] and recently reported evidence
points to a role of &subunits
in receptor gcoupling. for example, a moderate molar excess of
&-subunits promotes receptor-activated
gtpase
activity in the case of p-adrenoceptor and g, [7]

and bleached rhodopsin and gt, or gb [ 13,141.
moreover, &subunits
shift partially purified
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor co-reconstituted
with g, into lipid vesicles towards the high-affinity
state for agonists [ 151. a putative direct interaction
between &subunits
and rhodopsin may be deduced from the fact that a polyclonal antibody
preparation against fly-transducin contains antiidiotypic antibodies against rhodopsin, because
this could be interpreted to mean that rhodopsin
has a specific binding domain for&subunits
[ 161.
this interpretation is supported by the fact that
transducinfly-subunits
inhibit the phosphorylation
of rhodopsin by rhodopsin kinase and interfere
with binding of antibodies directed against
carboxyl-terminal
peptides containing the phosphorylation sites in rhodopsin [ 171. to these data
suggesting direct interaction between fly-subunits
and receptors we now add information indicating
that pure &subunits
of g-proteins prepared from
turkey erythrocytes and bovine brain interact with
pi-adrenoceptor also purified from turkey erythrocytes when the receptor is activated by a hormone
agonist.
2. materials

and methods

the pi-adrenoceptors from turkey erythrocyte membranes
were purified according to published procedures [18,19]. g, and
gb from turkey erythrocytes were purified as described by northup et al. [io]. the&-subunits of g-proteins were purified to
homogeneity either from bovine brain [20] or from turkey
erythrocytes [lo]. the purified &-subunits were concentrated
on a hydroxyapatite column and stored at -80°c in 25 mm
hepes buffer @ xxxd736xxx .0) containing 100 mm nacl, 1 mm dtt,
0.05% lubrol-px and 10% glycerol. the 81 ar and ,f3~preparations were free of giu, cm and g, as shown by
[‘ss]gtpys binding, silver staining [21], [‘*p]adp-ribosylation and immunoblotting techniques (see fig.1). [‘*pinad
was synthesized as described by cassel and pfeuffer [22]. pertussis toxin catalyzed adp-ribosylation was carried out by the
procedure of bokoch et al. 1231. immunoblotting was performed according to towbin et al. [24] using polyclonal antibodies against g,-peptide (379-394) from bovine brain [25].
the concentrations of bt-adrenoceptor and &subunits
were
measured by [3h]dha binding and the [‘hjfluorodinitrobenzene method, respectively [19]. the binding of &-subunits
to thefli-adrenoceptor was examined by gel permeation [26,27].
for that purpose, the fit-adrenoceptor
was applied to a
sephadex g-50 column equilibrated with ‘**i+subunits
(3ooo
cpm/pmol) in 20 mm hepes, 100 mm nacl, 0.5 mm dtt and
0.25% monolauroyl sucrose buffer (ph 8.0). the radioactivity
of each fraction was counted.

made it seem attractive to use native polyacrylamide gel in order
to detect association between fliar and &subunits
in the
presence of agonist. non-denaturing
polyacrylamide gels
(4-5%) were prepared by the method of hames [30] without a
stacking gel. gel electrophoresis was carried out under the conditions of laemmli [31] except that sds was omitted and
replaced by 0.25% monolauroyl sucrose for the gel preparation
and for the running buffer. monolauroyl sucrose is a neutral
detergent with a high cmc which does not denaturepar and gproteins and prevents aggregation of hydrophobic proteins [19].
depending on experimental conditions the gels were prepared
with or without ligands. the electrophoresis was carried out
overnight at 4°c and 8 ma. /3tar and &-subunits were labelled with “‘1 by the chloramine-t method [32].

3. results and discussion

the data in fig.2 show an increased mobility of
1251-labelled fly-subunits in 4% non-denaturing
polyacrylamide gels as a function of increasing
par concentrations. the mobility increase was
only observed in the presence of 10e4 m l-( -) xxxd2401xxx  in the preincubation and in the gel
and in the running buffer. in the control (fig.2b)
 xxxd2401xxx  was replaced in the preincubation
and in the gel by 10e6 m i- xxxd123xxx . no change
of &-subunit mobility was recorded. the same experiment was carried out using bovine brain flya. protein

obtained

from avian

carried out using 1251-flarand increasing concentrations of fly-subunits. similar results like those
shown in fig.2a were obtained. the mobility of

than in their absence. again the mobility increase
was only seen in the presence of  xxxd2401xxx  (not
shown). binding of fly-subunits to piar was also
followed by equilibrium binding on a gel-filtration
column (fig.3). a peak of iz51-radioactivity corresponding to a &receptor
complex was observed
in the presence of  xxxd2401xxx . assuming a 1: 1
complex of fly and ,&tar, the radioactive peak is
consistent with 1.78 pmol of 2 pmolpiar applied.
on the other hand, the antagonist prevented the interaction of ,6iar with fly-subunits like in the
above experiments. but a smaller peak of 1251-fiysubunits was observed even in the absence of
ligand indicating an interaction between nonliganded par and fly. a similar, but considerably
smaller trough centered at fraction 15 in the
presence of  xxxd123xxx  results from the fact that the
receptor was applied to the column in the absence
of fly-subunits.

matrix must be postulated. it was noted that
preincubation,
conditions
for
the
among
temperature was crucial: when the temperature for
the preincubation was lowered from 30°c to 4°c
the mobility change in the presence of agonist was
not observed (cf. fig.4a and b).
a considerable effort was made to detect a
change in the affinity of the ,&lar on coreconstitution with &-subunits into lipid vesicles
using methods established in this laboratory [7,18].
however, the reconstituted turkey prar did not
respond well to interaction with either nonactivated or activated forms of g, with a shift from
a high-affinity to low-affinity state in the presence

a

of the hormone
agonist. but, one should
remember that in turkey membranes the sensitivity
of this shift is controversial [33-351. this unfavorable property of the turkey prar might have
been responsible for the failure to obtain unequivocal effects with co-reconstituted &subunits
on ligand displacement at the receptor.
the experiments reported here show that
purified turkey,&rar can interact with&subunits
of g-proteins from the same source or from bovine
brain. the consequence of this interaction probably is formation
of a ‘hormone-piar
@ycomplex’. the molecular basis of the conformational changes responsible for the par-fly interaction is not known. the mobility change of the interacting proteins suggests a decreased pk, but for
what discrete structural change, protonationdeprotonation might be indicative is as obscure as
is a possible functional significance for interactions of fl-adrenoceptors with fly-subunits in the
course of signal transmission
in the native
membrane.
