divergence of volatile anesthetic effects in inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors.  the mechanism of volatile anesthetic (va) action is unknown. inhibitory receptors for the neurotransmitters  xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) or glycine are typically positively modulated by vas and may be important targets for their action. the existence of a gaba receptor subtype (p), which is uniquely inhibited by vas, suggested a chimeric receptor approach to identify portions of these proteins that may be necessary for anesthetic effects.
