(pr)-positive ductal invasive mammary carcinomas in balb/c
mice. we sought to reproduce this mpa cancer model in
c57bl/6 mice because of their widespread use in genetic
engineering. within this experimental setting, we studied the
carcinogenic effects of mpa, the morphologic changes in
mammary glands that are induced by mpa and progesterone,
and the levels of er and pr expression in mpa-treated and
progesterone-treated mammary glands. finally, we evaluated
whether the differences found between balb/c and c57bl/6
mouse strains were due to intrinsic differences in epithelial cells.
methods the carcinogenic effect of mpa was evaluated in
c57bl/6 mice using protocols proven to be carcinogenic in
balb/c mice. in addition, balb/c and c57bl/6 females were
treated with progesterone or mpa for 1 or 2 months, and
mammary glands were excised for histologic studies and for
immunohistochemical and western blot evaluation of er and
pr. hormone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay.
isolated mammary epithelial cells were transplanted into cleared
fat pads of 21-day-old female swiss nu/nu mice or control
congenic animals.

results mpa failed to induce mammary carcinomas or
significant morphologic changes in the mammary glands of
c57bl/6 mice. the expression of  xxxg730xxx  and pr isoform a in
virgin mice was surprisingly much higher in balb/c than in
c57bl/6 mammary glands, and both receptors were
downregulated in progestin-treated balb/c mice (p < 0.05).
pr isoform b levels were low in virgin control mice and
increased after progestin treatment in both strains.  xxxg731xxx 
expression followed a similar trend. no differences in hormone
levels were found between strains. surprisingly, the
transplantation of the epithelial mammary gland cells of both
strains into the cleared fat pads of swiss (nu/nu) mice abolished
the mammary gland morphologic differences and the er and pr
differences between strains.
conclusion c57bl/6 mammary glands are resistant to mpainduced carcinogenesis and to hormone action. mpa and
progesterone have different effects on mammary glands. low
 xxxg730xxx  and pr-a levels in untreated mammary glands may be
associated with a low-risk breast cancer profile. although we
cannot at this time rule out the participation of other, untested
factors, our findings implicate the stroma as playing a crucial
role in the strain-specific differential  xxxg1603xxx 
expression and hormone responsiveness.

introduction
breast cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed
among women worldwide, and it is the second leading cause
of cancer mortality [1]. one of the hallmarks of the disease is
the expression of  xxxg730xxx  (er) and progesterone
receptor (pr), and it is this expression that ultimately drives
prognosis and treatment approaches.
during the past 50 years, the experimental study of breast cancer has been approached utilizing many different in vivo as
well as in vitro models, some of which have been used widely
[2,3]: the 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene [4,5] and nmethyl-n-nitrosourea induced mammary tumors in rats [6];
mouse mammary tumor virus (mmtv)-induced carcinomas [7];
human breast cancer cell lines growing in cell culture [8-11] or
as xenografts [12]; transgenic and knockout animals [13,14];
and, more recently, conditional knockout and inducible transgenic mice [15]. genetically engineered mice have been used
extensively to model human breast cancer as well as to dissect
the molecular pathways of tumorigenesis [16], and they have
contributed much to our understanding of how cancer evolves.
interestingly, most of the genetically modified mice available
for the study of breast cancer do not express er and pr [2],
leaving few models available in which to address hormonedependent tumor progression specifically.
 xxxd2554xxx  (mpa) induces ductal mammary carcinomas in balb/c mice that express er and pr
[17,18]. during preliminary studies, conducted to investigate
strains that may be susceptible to mpa other than balb/c, we
found c57bl/6 to be resistant to the standard mpa dosage
that is used to develop mammary carcinomas. this strain had
already been reported to be resistant to mammary tumorigenesis induced by mmtv [7], urethane [19] and gamma radiation
[20,21]. interestingly, however, most of the genetically modified mammary tumor models have been developed in a
c57bl/6 or fvb background [16], without any previous
experimental evidence to indicate that these strains were suitable for the study of mammary tumorigenesis, in terms of susceptibility to the more standard hormonal/chemical
approaches.
with this in mind, we decided to study further the resistance
of the c57bl/6 strain to hormonal carcinogenesis, and to
advance the characterization of possible underlying differences in hormone responsiveness. in this study we demonstrated that c57bl/6 mammary glands are resistant not only
to mpa carcinogenesis but also to hormone-induced mammary gland development. the higher responsiveness of balb/
c mice was associated with higher levels of expression of  xxxg730xxx  and pr isoform a, suggesting that a high  xxxg730xxx  and pr-a
profile may be related to breast cancer susceptibility. finally,
we were able to demonstrate that this specific strain difference disappeared when epithelial cells of either strain were
transplanted into a different strain background, indicating that

host factors, possibly stroma, may be responsible for the differential hormone responsiveness.

materials and methods
animals
two month-old virgin female balb/c mice (instituto de
biología y medicina experimental, buenos aires, argentina)
and c57bl/6j mice (instituto de biología y medicina experimental and academia nacional de medicina, buenos aires,
argentina) were used for these experiments, and swissfoxn1nu/foxn1nu (nu/nu) were purchased from la plata animal facilities (buenos aires province, argentina). the animals
were housed in groups of four per cage in an air-conditioned
room at 20 ± 2°c under a 12-hour light/dark cycle, and given
free access to food and tap water. animal care and manipulation were in agreement with institutional guidelines and with
the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals [22].
athymic nude mice were maintained under the same conditions in a germ-free environment.
tumor incidence: long-term experiments

experiment 1
this experiment, conducted in c57bl/6 mice, was performed
simultaneously with previously reported experiments in balb/
c mice, applying the same protocol originally used to induce
mammary carcinomas [23,24]. a total of 38, 2-month-old
mice, were subcutaneously implanted with 40 mg mpa depot
( xxxd2554xxx , gador laboratory, buenos aires, argentina)
every 2 months (four times) for 1 year; 31 control animals
received only vehicle. the animals were evaluated twice
weekly to detect the appearance of mammary tumors. this
experiment was terminated after 1 year because of the emergence of severe skin ulcerations in mpa-treated c57bl/6
mice and in some of the control animals. it has been reported
that aged c57bl/6 mice frequently develop spontaneous
ulcerative dermatitis [25].
experiment 2
to minimize the possibility of development of skin lesions, the
experiment was repeated with a lower mpa dosage, which
also proved to be carcinogenic in balb/c mice [23]. silastic
pellets containing 40 mg mpa (sigma co, st louis, mo, isa)
were implanted subcutaneously in 39 virgin, 2-month-old,
c57bl/6 female mice, and replaced 6 months later; an equal
number of control animals were implanted with control blank
silastic pellets. the mice were evaluated daily, and those that
developed skin lesions were isolated to prevent further damage, but continued to be evaluated as part of the experiment.
the animals were weighed every week and followed for 14
months. vaginal smears were obtained from selected mice in
control and mpa-treated groups to confirm hormone action.
after 6 months, mpa-treated mice started to cycle again and
mpa pellets were replaced. every 2 months two mice from
both groups were killed for histologic evaluation of mammary
gland hormone responsiveness. at the end of the experiments

available online http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/9/2/r22

both control and treated animals were killed and mammary
glands fixed in formalin (right 4th gland), prepared for whole
mounts (left 4th gland), or frozen for western blot studies.
short-term experiments

mammary gland and salivary gland morphologic studies
a total of 24 balb/c and 24 c57bl/6 virgin females (2month-old) were implanted subcutaneously with 20 mg mpa,
progesterone (sigma co.), or control blank silastic pellets
(four mice per group). after 4 or 8 weeks the animals were
killed, and salivary glands and the 4th right mammary glands
were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. left mammary
glands were processed for whole mounts. this experiment
was repeated twice. control animals were killed at diestrus.
the morphologic features and the number of ducts, lateral
branches, and lobules of the mammary glands of virgin
untreated and progestin-treated mice were evaluated in hematoxylin and eosin stained slides and quantified in 40× fields.
whole mount studies
the mammary glands were excised together with the attached
skin, stretched and pinned down to a cork slab, and fixed in
10% buffered formalin for 24 hours. after fixation, the glands
were dissected and extensively washed with distilled water,
and lipids were removed by immersing in acetone for 2 days,
at room temperature. after hydration with decreasing concentrations of ethanol, the tissues were left overnight in water and
stained with toluidine blue (0.025% in water) for 40 min followed by thorough washings with distilled water. the staining
was adjusted by destaining, if necessary, with methanol for 30
min and 70% ethanol for other 30 min, under microscopic
observation. after washing with distilled water the tissues
were fixed in ammonium molybdate for 30 min, washed again,
dehydrated in ethanol with increasing concentrations, and
transferred to xylene overnight before mounting.
immunohistochemistry
paraffin-embedded sections were reacted with various antibodies using the avidin biotin peroxidase complex technique
(vectastain elite abc kit; vector laboratories, burlingame,
ca, usa). briefly, after dewaxing and hydrating, endogenous
peroxidase activity was inhibited using 3% h2o2 in distilled
water. blocking solution (2% normal goat serum) was used
before specific antibody. polyclonal antibodies to  xxxg730xxx  (mc20; santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa),  xxxg731xxx 
(chicken antibody kindly provided by jan-åke gustafsson,
karolinska institutet, novum, sweden), and pr a (c-20; santa
cruz biotechnology) and the monoclonal antibody to pr-b
(ab 6; neomarkers, union city, ca) were used at 1:100 dilution and incubated overnight at 4°c. after incubation with the
appropriate secondary antibodies (vector laboratories) the
reactions were developed with 3-3'diaminobenzidine 0.30%
in phosphate-buffered saline with h2o2 to a final concentration of 0.5%, under microscopic control. specimens were
counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted.

to quantify er and pr, 1500 epithelial cells per slide were
counted.

western blots
mammary glands were homogenized with a polytron at setting
50 with three bursts of 5 s at a 1:4 ratio of tissue to tedgs
(50 mmol/l tris [ph 7.4], 7.5 mmol/l edta, 0.5 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.25 mol/l sucrose) buffer. protease inhibitors [0.5 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride
(pmsf), 0.025 mmol/l cbz-l-phenylalanine choromethylketone (zpck), 0.0025 mmol/l n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine choromethylketone (tlck), 0.025 mmol/l n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-phenylalaninechlomethylketone (tpck), 0.025 mmol/l n-alpha-ptosyl-l-argininemethylester (tame)] were added before preparing the extracts. the homogenate was centrifuged for 10
min at 3,300 rpm at 4°c, and the nuclei on the pellet were
washed in tedgs buffer plus 0.01% np-40. the nuclei were
resuspended in tedgs containing 0.4 mol/l kcl and incubated at 4°c for 30 min, and the nuclear homogenate was
centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°c. the nuclear
extract was diluted 1:2 in tedgs buffer with 30% glycerol, to
reduce the salt concentration. proteins were quantified using
the method proposed by lowry and coworkers [26].
the samples (100 mug total protein/lane) were separated on
8% (pr) or 10% (er) discontinuous polyacrylamide gels
(sds-page) using laemmli's buffer system [27]. the proteins were dissolved in sample buffer (6 mmol/l tris [ph 6.8],
2% sds, 0.002% bromophenol blue, 20% glycerol, and 5%
 xxxd26xxx ) and boiled for 4 min. after electrophoresis,
they were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked
overnight in 5% dry skimmed milk dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline-tween (pbst) 0.1% (0.8% nacl, 0.02% kcl,
0.144% na2po4, 0.024% kh2po4 [ph 7.4], 0.1% tween
20). the membranes were washed several times with pbst
and then incubated with pr ab-7/hpra 7 (ab7; neomarkers,
union city, ca, usa) or c-19 (santa cruz),  xxxg730xxx  (mc-20;
santa cruz), or actin (clone actn05; neomarkers) at room
temperature for 2 hours, at a concentration of 2 mug/ml in
pbst. blots were probed with sheep anti-mouse or donkey
anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated whole antibody (amersham life science, buckinghamshire, uk). the luminescent signal was generated with the
ecl western blotting detection reagent kit (amersham pharmacia biotech, buckinghamshire, uk), and the blots were
exposed to medical x-ray film (curix rp1; agfa argentina, florencio varela, buenos aires) for 10 s to 5 min. band intensity
was not quantified if the film was saturated.

effect of 17beta-estradiol on mammary gland development
four balb/c and four c57bl/6 mice were implanted with 20
mug 17beta-estradiol (e2) pellets, or e2 plus 20 mg mpa, or progesterone, and killed after 2 months. mammary glands were
processed as described above for morphologic studies.

prolactin,  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx , and  xxxg1144xxx 
balb/c (n = 28) and c57bl/6 (n = 27), 2-month-old female
mice were implanted subcutaneously with control blank silastic, mpa (40 mg), or progesterone (40 mg) pellets, and after
24 hours the animals were bled by retrorbital puncture under
anesthesia. control mice were bled at diestrus, as evaluated
by vaginal smears. prolactin and  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  were measured by radioimmunoassay using a kit provided by the national
institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases
(niddk; dr af parlow, national hormone and pituitary program, torrance, ca, usa). the assays were performed using
10 mul serum samples in duplicate, and the results were
expressed in terms of the reference preparation of mouse prolactin niddk-rp3 and mouse  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  afp-107836
standards, respectively. intra-assay and interassay coefficients
of variation were 7.2% and 12.8%, and 8.4% and 13.2%,
respectively [28]. for insulin-like growth factor (igf)-i radioimmunoassay, serum samples (15 mul) and  xxxg1144xxx  standards were
subjected to the acid-ethanol cryoprecipitation method, as
previously described [28].  xxxg1144xxx  was determined using an antibody (ub2-495) provided by drs l underwood and jj van
wyk, and distributed by the hormone distribution program of
the niddk. recombinant human  xxxg1144xxx  (chiron corp., emeryville, ca, usa) was used as radioligand and unlabeled ligand.
the assay sensitivity was 6 pg per tube. intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were 8.2% and 14.1%, respectively. progesterone was determined by radioimmunoassay
using an antibody kindly provided by dr gd niswender (colorado state university, fort collins, co, usa), and labeled hormone (progesterone [1,2,6,7 3h(n)]) was purchased from
dupont nen, boston, ma, usa. assay sensitivity was 50 pg,
and intra and interassay coefficients of variance were 7.5 and
11.9%, respectively.

camera with the qimaging pro software (mvia, inc., monaca,
pa, usa). the images were then aligned together using the
panavue image assembler software (panavue co., quebec
city, quebec, canada). the resulting image was a high-quality
panoramic picture of the lesion that allowed us to select the
epithelial areas. images were quantified using the northern
eclipse image analysis software (empix imaging, north tonawanda, ny, usa) and expressed as the total epithelial area
and the number of structures selected in each histologically
defined area. to determine er and pr expression in reconstituted mammary glands, the same procedures were performed
in four untreated swiss nu/nu mice, balb/c or c57bl/6
mice.

transplantation of balb/c or c57bl/6 epithelial mammary
cells into cleared fat pads from swiss nude mice
mammary glands from six c57bl/6 and six balb/c 2-monthold female mice were excised and epithelial cells were isolated
using the same protocol that we routinely use to isolate mammary tumor cells [29]. an equal number of cells (106 in 5 mul)
was inoculated in the right (balb/c) or left (c57bl/6) cleared
fat pads of 21-day-old female nu/nu mice (swiss background)
that had previously been implanted subcutaneously with progesterone (20 mg) or mpa (20 mg) silastic pellet also containing 20 mug e2; four animals received blank silastic pellets, and
four animals were used as a control ensuring that no epithelial
cells remained after clearing the fat pads. the mammary
glands were cleared according to standardized protocols
[30,31]. four balb/c and four c57bl/6 mice were also used
as control animals. after 30 days, mammary glands were
excised, fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde, and prepared for
histologic evaluation. the experiment was repeated twice. to
capture the entire area of interest, several partially overlapping
high-definition images were taken from each case with a total
magnification of 160×, using a real-time nikon 1300 digital

microsatellite genotyping
epithelial dna was typed by pcr using a panel of four microsatellites (also known as simple sequence length polymorphisms) polymorphic between c57bl/6 and the outbred
swiss recipient nude females. the simple sequence length
polymorphism primers (mouse mappairs) were purchased
from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca, usa). an aliquot of 100 ng
genomic dna (5 mul of 20 ng/mul) was amplified in a 25 mul pcr
reaction containing 2.5 mul 10× pcr buffer (15 mmol/l mgcl2),
0.5 mul 10 mmol/l dntp, 1 mul of each primer (final concentration
180 mumol/l), 0.1 mul 5 u/mul taq polymerase, and 14.9 mul sterile
water. hot start pcr (in which crucial reaction components
are withheld until reaction temperatures are reached) was performed by means of faststart taq polymerase (roche, indianapolis, in, usa). initial denaturation (94°c for 6 min), 35
cycles (45 s at 94°c, 45 s at 55°c, and 30 s at 72°c), and
final incubation at 72°c for 7 min were carried out using a perkin-elmer model 9600 dna thermal cycler (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa). pcr products were separated
by electrophoresis in 4% agarose gels, and stained with 0.5
mug/ml ethidium bromide.

laser capture microdissection studies
four to six 6 mum consecutive sections from normal mammary
gland were obtained from paraffin-embedded tissue, dewaxed
as described above, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
approximately 5 × 103 ductal epithelial cells were then microdissected using a pixcell ii lcm system (arcturus engineering, mountain view, ca, usa). briefly, the cap was inserted
into an eppendorf tube containing digestion buffer (50 mul
buffer containing 0.04% proteinase k*, 10 mmol/l tris-hcl
[ph 8.0], 1 mmol/l edta, and 1% tween-20). the tube was
placed in an oven at 37°c to equilibrate and then placed
upside down so that the digestion buffer contacts the tissue
on the cap. the incubation continued overnight at 37°c and
was then centrifuged for 5 min and the cap removed. the reaction was heated to 95°c for 8 min to inactivate the proteinase
k. samples were purified by means of the dneasy tissue system kit (qiagen, chatsworth, ca, usa) before pcr. we performed tests of the dna samples by pcr amplifications with
four informative microsatellite markers.

statistical analysis
differences between groups in the number of structures and
stained nuclei were evaluated using analysis of variance
(anova) followed by the tukey t-test to compare differences
between experimental and control groups. to compare differences in body weight or prolactin,  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx ,  xxxg1144xxx , or
progesterone serum levels between progestin-treated and
untreated mice, a two-way anova was used. the actuarial
incidence of mammary tumor was calculated according to
kaplan-meier distributions and log rank tests as described
previously [23], and differences in tumor incidences were evaluated using chi2 tests.

results
long term in vivo experiments

tumor incidence
from a total of 47 balb/c mice initially treated with mpa, 34
developed ductal infiltrating carcinomas, from which 13 arose

during the first 12 months (27.6%). the mean latency was 52
weeks, and no mammary tumors were observed in untreated
control animals [24]. mpa-treated c57bl/6 female mice did
not develop mammary tumors, and neither did the control
untreated animals (treated balb/c versus treated c57bl/6
for 1 year; p < 0.001; data not shown). c57bl/6 mice treated
with mpa developed severe skin ulcerations, and this arm of
the experiment had to be stopped after a year.
in a second experiment, only c57bl/6 mice were treated
using a protocol that had also proven to be carcinogenic in
balb/c animals, consisting of implanting 40 mg mpa pellets
at the beginning of the experiment and replacing them after 6
months [23]. none of the animals in this group developed any
mammary lesions, and after 14 months the experiment was terminated (figure 1a).

mammary gland morphology
mpa induces proliferative ductal lesions in balb/c mice that
are characterized by preneoplastic intraductal solid, papillary,
or cribiform growth associated with an intense stromal reaction, with periductal fibrosis, an increase in mammary connective tissue, and moderate to intense mononuclear infiltration
[32]. in whole mount studies, mammary glands from mpatreated animals exhibited a gross distortion of the mammary
gland architecture and developed hyperplasia in the form of
paraductal branching (figure 1b, top). ductal hyperplasia was
also a common finding. none of these lesions were observed
in c57bl/6 mpa-treated mice (figure 1b, bottom).
effect of mpa on body weight
we previously observed a significant anabolic effect of mpa
on the body weight of balb/c mice [33,34] and, as shown in
this study, a similar effect was observed in c57bl/6 mice (figure 1c; two-way anova, p < 0.001).
short term experiments

mammary gland morphology
to evaluate early morphologic responses to mpa or progesterone on the mammary gland, c57bl/6 and balb/c mice
were treated with mpa or progesterone, or implanted with
blank silastic pellets for 4 or 8 weeks, after which the animals
were killed and the mammary glands excised and processed
for whole mount or hematoxylin and eosin studies. when
untreated mammary glands from control virgin mice of both
strains, without any treatment and in the same phase of the
estrous cycle, were compared, balb/c untreated mammary
glands exhibited more ductal side branching than did c57bl/
6 glands (figure 2a,b, left panels), and only balb/c mice
exhibited a significant increase in mpa-induced ductal branching in mammary glands (figure 2a,b, middle panels; p <
0.001). the effect of progesterone was different from that of
mpa; lobular differentiation was observed in both strains,
although the effect in balb/c mice was more prominent (figures 2a,b, right panels). quantification of these morphologic
differences is shown in figure 2c. these experiments confirm
that mpa and progesterone have different effects in c57bl/6
and balb/c animals, with significantly lower hormone responsiveness in the c57bl/6 strain.
hormone receptors
all receptors were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using
validated antibodies [35-38]. the number of positive cells was
expressed as the percentage of stained nuclei per number of
epithelial cells/400× fields. there were significant differences
in the number of  xxxg730xxx -positive cells between virgin mammary
glands of both strains (41.2 ± 10% in balb/c versus 19 ±
7.5% in c57bl/6 mice; p < 0.001; figures 3a and 4c). mpa
treatment resulted in a significant decrease in  xxxg730xxx  expression
only in balb/c mice (figure 3a; p < 0.05).  xxxg731xxx  expression
was low in control virgin mice of both strains (figures 3b and
4c) that increased in mpa (p < 0.05) and in progesterone-

the pattern of pr-a expression was very similar to that of  xxxg730xxx ; again, significantly higher levels were observed in untreated
balb/c mice (figure 4a,c), which were more efficiently downregulated by mpa (p < 0.001) than by progesterone (p <
0.05; figure 5a). virgin untreated mice of both strains exhibit
almost no pr-b expression, as previously reported [35] (figures 4b,c). interestingly, pr-b was highly expressed in mpa
and progesterone treated balb/c (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05,
respectively) and c57bl/6 mice (p < 0.01; figure 4b), and
followed a similar pattern of expression as  xxxg731xxx .
nuclear extracts from progestin-treated or virgin control mice
were used for western blots (figure 5a). extracts were normalized by protein content. because mammary glands from virgin mice have less epithelial cells than progestin-treated mice,
and on the other hand both stroma and epithelium may
express steroid receptors, which may be differentially regulated, we only quantified the ratio between both isoforms in the
same blot (figure 5b). the pr-a/pr-b ratio was significantly
higher in virgin as compared with progestin treated mice of
both strains, supporting the immunohistochemical data. in
addition, virgin balb/c mammary glands expressed higher
levels of pr-a and  xxxg730xxx  (data not shown) than did c57bl/6
glands (p < 0.01). significant differences between mpa and
progesterone treatment were not detected in western blots.

progestin effect on salivary gland morphology
mpa, because of its androgenic action [39], has a specific
effect on salivary gland morphology in that it induces the development of convoluted granular ducts [24], which was
observed in both strains (figure 6a). progesterone had no
notable effects on salivary glands.
serum prolactin,  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx ,  xxxd3023xxx , and insulinlike growth factor-i levels
er knockout mice develop a hypoplastic mammary gland phenotype as a consequence of a pituitary gland dysfunction
associated with a decrease in prolactin levels [40]. to explore
the possibility of pituitary dysfunction as an explanation for the
strain differences in hormone responsiveness, we evaluated
serum levels of prolactin in control and progestin-treated mice,
but we failed to observe any difference between c57bl/6 and
balb/c mice. in addition, prolactin levels were increased in
progestin-treated animals of both strains (p < 0.001, two-way
anova; figure 6b). similarly, no differences in progesterone,
 xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx , or  xxxg1144xxx  levels between strains were
observed. furthermore, serum levels of progesterone reached
after the implantation of 20 mg progesterone pellets was also
similar in both strains (figure 6b).

transplantation experiments
to further explore whether the responsiveness of this strain
was related to differences in the epithelial mammary cells or in
the stromal environment, we transplanted the epithelial
mammary cells into nu/nu mice of a different strain background. because nude mice lack functional ovaries and consequently have very low e2 levels, this hormone had to be
supplemented (20 mug) to the mpa or progesterone standard
pellets. therefore, we first evaluated whether the differences

between strains were also observed when e2 or combined e2
and progesterone pellets were used. the differences were significant, even with e2 alone (figure 7). e2 induced duct dilation
whereas the combined treatment induced a high proliferative
response, with increased branching and lobule-alveolar differentiation. surprisingly, however, c57bl/6 cells were able to
repopulate the cleared fat pads of mpa/e2-treated or progesterone/e2-treated swiss nu/nu mice as efficiently as balb/c

 xxxg1603xxx  expression and that the level of these receptors is related to the degree of hormone responsiveness.

discussion
the c57bl/6 strain is reputed to be relatively resistant to
some chemical carcinogenesis protocols [41-43] and relatively susceptible to spontaneous and chemically induced
melanomas [44], radiation-induced leukemia [45], and chemically induced urinary bladder carcinomas [46]. regarding
mammary tumorigenesis, the c57bl/6 strain is considered to
be resistant to mmtv [7], urethane [47], and gamma radiation
[20,21].
in this study we demonstrated that c57bl/6 female mice
were resistant to mpa-induced carcinogenesis, and that this
resistance was associated with poor mammary gland responsiveness to the exogenous administration of progestins and/or
estrogens. we also observed significantly different levels of
 xxxg730xxx  and pr-a in the sensitive and resistant strains, that may
be associated with the poor responsiveness described. surprisingly, c57bl/6 mammary epithelial cells may be as
responsive as balb/c cells and exhibit similar levels of hormone receptors when transplanted into cleared fat pads of a
different strain, indicating that host factors rather than the epithelial cells by themselves are responsible for their hormone
resistance.

er and pr expression in recombined mammary glands in
nu/nu mice
we were now interested in determining whether the differences in  xxxg730xxx  and pr-a expression observed between both
strains would even out when epithelial mammary cells from
both strains were inoculated in the same host. because the
differences were evident only in untreated animals, we performed the same recombination experiments in untreated
mice. figure 9 shows ducts that originated from c57bl/6 or
balb/c cells transplanted in the same nu/nu mouse; no significant differences in  xxxg730xxx  or pr-a expression were

a hypoplastic phenotype of c57bl/6 mammary glands was
reported by nandi and bern in 1960 [48]. in most of their
experiments, hormonal treatment was provided by the kidney
subcapsular implantation of the pituitary gland, or by the
administration of estrogens or combinations of estrogens plus
progesterone; the effects of progestins alone, however, have
been evaluated in very few studies [23,49]. our findings demonstrate a differential effect of progestins in balb/c and
c57bl/6 female mice and confirm the observations by nandi
and bern regarding differences in mammary glands of virgin
mice. mpa induced ductal branching whereas progesterone
induced lobular differentiation in balb/c and not in c57bl/6
mice. these observations correlate with the fact that mpa
induced mainly ductal carcinomas whereas progesterone generated mainly lobular carcinomas in balb/c mice [23]. these
tumors are different not only in histology but also in er, pr,
and  xxxg681xxx  (egf) receptor expression [24].
recent studies indicate that progesterone and mpa trigger
different transduction signals in the human breast cancer cell
line t47d [50] and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells
[51]. different in vivo effects were also reported in previous
studies, in which it was observed that mpa induced the synthesis of egf in salivary glands as an  xxxg183xxx  ligand [39,52]. this effect was not achieved by progesterone. as
we have demonstrated in previous studies, salivary gland egf

(p < 0.001, two-way anova). the increase in pg levels after progesterone administration was also similar in both strains (p < 0.001, two-way
anova). gray bars: balb/c; black bars: c57bl/6. anova, analysis of variance; gh,  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx ; igf, insulin-like growth factor; mpa,

does participate in mpa-induced mammary gland
carcinogenesis [24,53]. because c57bl/6 mammary glands
responded poorly to both mpa and progesterone, it seemed
unlikely that the differences in the two strains were related to
differences in salivary gland responsiveness. this was supported by the fact that no histologic differences with respect
to mpa-induced development of convoluted granular ducts of
the salivary glands, the source of egf, were found across
strains. mpa has been used as an anabolic agent in oncology
[54] and, as we have shown in previous studies, it exerts an
anabolic effect in balb/c female mice [33]. in the present

study we demonstrated a similar effect in c57bl/6 mice,
showing that this is a strain-independent mechanism.
we have also explored the possibility of impaired pituitary
function, which plays a very important role in determining the
hypoplastic mammary gland phenotype in er knockout mice
[40], and is associated with low prolactin levels. however, in
our study, prolactin levels were similar in c57bl/6 and balb/
c mice and in progestin-treated animals of both strains. the
same was true for progesterone,  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx , and  xxxg1144xxx 
serum levels.

beta and pr-b exhibited similar kinetics; their expression was low
in control mice and it increased in progestin-treated balb/c
mice. aupperlee and coworkers [35] reported similar results in
their studies of pr-b expression in pregnant balb/c mice.
these results, when extrapolated to humans, suggest that individual levels of  xxxg730xxx  and pr-a in the mammary glands could
predict hormone responsiveness and cancer risk. it has been
reported that low levels of  xxxg730xxx  expression are observed in
women of low risk groups [56,57]. as proof of principle, frech
and coworkers [58] developed transgenic mice that overexpress  xxxg730xxx  in a c57bl/6 background, in which the number of
 xxxg730xxx  positive cells in transfected glands was similar to that in
the virgin balb/c mice we report on here. curiously, ductal
hyperplasias were reported in the transgenic mice even in the
absence of estrogens. as a consequence of  xxxg730xxx  overexpression, increased pr levels were also observed.

taken together, all of the described results appeared to point
to strain differences intrinsic to the mammary gland. to explore
this possibility, we sought to determine the presence and functionality of mammary steroid receptors in both strains. to evaluate pr a, we used c-19 and c-20 antibodies (santa cruz)
that recognize this isoform in human tissues [55] and mouse
tissues [35,38]. we observed significantly lower levels of  xxxg730xxx  and pr-a in virgin c57bl/6 adult female mice, as compared
with balb/c. the only pr isoform that we found to be highly
expressed in balb/c virgin mice was pr-a, as was previously
described by auperlee and coworkers [35]. pr-a and  xxxg730xxx 
were significantly downregulated in both balb/c mpatreated and progesterone-treated mice, and it is interesting to
note that  xxxg730xxx  expression usually paralleled that of pr-a. er-

the expression of er and pr is regulated by endocrine factors
and by extracellular matrix components such as collagen iv or
laminin [59]. to explore a role for the stroma in the strain difference in hormone responsiveness, we used transplanted
epithelial cells into the cleared fat pad of swiss nude mice. the
fact that both c57bl/6 and balb/c epithelial cells
responded very similarly in a different strain background suggests that the mammary gland fat pad from the host may be
regulating the epithelial hormone responsiveness. at this
moment we cannot, however, rule out the participation in the
process of other host factors related to the microenvironment,
which may be also be playing an active role. experiments are
currently underway in our laboratory to test this alternative
hypothesis. similar data were reported by naylor and
ormandy [60]. those investigators recombined epithelial cells
from 129 strain, which is similar to balb/c, with c57bl/6
stroma, and observed a poorly side-branched c57bl/6 pattern. a major challenge will be to identify the stromal factors
responsible for maintaining high er and pr-a levels in balb/
c mice.
different studies have been designed to explain balb/c susceptibility to mammary carcinogenesis. the frequency of mammary tumors differs among strains of  xxxg2313xxx +/- mice, with
mammary tumors occurring only on a balb/c genetic background and showing a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity
[61]. interestingly, progesterone is necessary and favors aneuploidy in this model [62]. in the irradiation model, the
increased genomic instability of balb/c mice has been
ascribed to two polymorphisms in the coding region of prkdc
[63]; this is the gene that encodes the dna-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, which is known to be involved in
dna double-stranded break repair. because it has been
shown that the stroma may be a target in radiation-induced
[64] and in chemical-induced carcinogenesis [65], other players important in parenchymal-stromal interactions related with
 xxxg1603xxx  expression may be involved in all models.

conclusion
in this study we demonstrated impaired hormone responsiveness in c57bl/6 mammary epithelial cells that is reflected in
responses to both physiologic and neoplastic stimuli, making
the strain resistant to hormonal carcinogenesis. this was
associated with low levels of  xxxg730xxx  and pr-a. further exploring
the phenomenon, we demonstrated that this is not due to
intrinsic impairments in the epithelial cells and that host fac-

tors, probably related to the mammary microenvironment, may
account for the defective hormonal behavior. the comparative
study of c57bl/6 and balb/c mice may help us to
understand the genetic basis of resistance and susceptibility
to hormone-induced mammary carcinogenesis.
