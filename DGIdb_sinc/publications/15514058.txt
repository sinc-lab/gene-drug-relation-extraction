abstract
thiamine (vitamin b1) is required in the diet of animals, and thiamine deficiency leads to diseases
such as beri-beri and the wernicke-korsakoff syndrome. dietary thiamine (vitamin b1) consists mainly of
thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp), which is transformed into thiamine by gastrointestinal phosphatases before
absorption. it is believed that tpp itself cannot be transported across plasma membranes in significant
amounts. we have identified a partial loss-of-function mutation in the caenorhabditis elegans gene (tpk-1)
that encodes thiamine pyrophosphokinase, which forms tpp from thiamine at the expense of atp inside
cells. the mutation slows physiological rhythms and the phenotype it produces can be rescued by tpp
but not thiamine supplementation. tpk-1 functions cell nonautonomously, as the expression of wild-type
tpk-1 in one tissue can rescue the function of other tissues that express only mutant tpk-1. these observations
indicate that, in contrast to expectation from previous evidence, tpp can be transported across cell
membranes. we also find that thiamine supplementation partially rescues the phenotype of partial lossof-function mutants of the na/k atpase, providing genetic evidence that thiamine absorption, and/or
redistribution from the absorbing cells, requires the full activity of this enzyme.

v

itamin b1 (thiamine), in the form of thiamine
pyrophosphate (tpp), is necessary for oxidative
phosphorylation and the pentose phosphate pathway
by acting as a cofactor for ␣-ketoacid dehydrogenases such
as pyruvate dehydrogenase (pdh), ␣-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (kgdh), branched-chain ␣-ketoacid dehydrogenase, and transketolase (reviewed in hohmann and
meacock 1998). animals, including humans, cannot
synthesize thiamine but extract it from a food source
via intestinal absorption. malnutrition or poor absorption of thiamine causes a deficiency that results in polyneuropathy, cardiomyopathy, disturbances of the bloodbrain barrier, and metabolic acidosis. well-known diseases
caused by thiamine deficiency include beri-beri and the
wernicke-korsakoff syndrome (reviewed in singleton
and martin 2001).
dietary thiamine consists mainly of tpp, but in the
intestinal lumen it is converted to thiamine by gastrointestinal phosphatases (rindi and laforenza 2000).
previous studies in humans, rats, and other animal species have revealed a dual mechanism for thiamine absorption in intestinal tissue (hoyumpa et al. 1982; rindi
and laforenza 2000) as well as in other tissues such
as liver (moseley et al. 1992), kidney (gastaldi et al.
2000), erythrocytes (casirola et al. 1990), and neuro-

sequence data from this article have been deposited with the
embl/genbank data libraries under accession no. ay513235.

blastoma cells (bettendorff 1995). at low physiological concentrations, thiamine is transported via a saturable, carrier-mediated process involving electroneutral
thiamine/h⫹ antiport (reviewed in rindi and laforenza 2000). at high concentrations, some studies suggest that simple diffusion of thiamine prevails (hoyumpa et al. 1982; rindi and laforenza 2000), while
others point to carrier-mediated absorption (moseley
et al. 1992; bettendorff and wins 1994).
recently, two closely related thiamine transporters
have been identified,  xxxg2100xxx  ( xxxg2100xxx ; diaz et al. 1999;
fleming et al. 1999; labay et al. 1999) and  xxxg2101xxx 
( xxxg2101xxx ; eudy et al. 2000; rajgopal et al. 2001; said
et al. 2004). the high-affinity carrier  xxxg2100xxx  is widely
expressed in human tissues but is most abundant in
skeletal muscle, followed by heart, placenta, kidney, and
liver. patients lacking the  xxxg2100xxx  transporter suffer from
thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome
characterized by diabetes mellitus, megaloblastic anemia, and sensorineural deafness (diaz et al. 1999; fleming et al. 1999; labay et al. 1999). most of these symptoms can be reversed by administration of large amounts
of thiamine.
the other high-affinity carrier,  xxxg2101xxx , is expressed
in many human tissues as well. the highest expression
is in placenta, followed by liver, kidney, and heart. the
reduced folate carrier (rfc-1) shares ⵑ40% protein
sequence identity with both thiamine transporters. evidence obtained in murine leukemia cells suggests that
rfc-1 might mediate influx of thiamine mono-phosphate (tmp) and efflux of tpp (zhao et al. 2001, 2002).

although thiamine uptake is not directly atp dependent, it is driven by the rapid phosphorylation of thiamine by cytosolic thiamine pyrophosphokinase to form
tpp at the expense of atp (lumeng et al. 1979; yoshioka 1984; bettendorff and wins 1994; bettendorff
1995). as a result, thiamine is found predominantly as
tpp within cells, existing as a large, stable pool associated
with enzymes such as transketolase, pdh, and ␣-kgdh.
since tpp is synthesized in the cytosol and pdh and
␣-kgdh are mitochondrial enzymes, the cofactor has
to be transported across the mitochondrial membranes.
inside mitochondria, tpp is hydrolyzed to tmp (barile
et al. 1990). in saccharomyces cerevisiae tpc1p was shown
to be involved in mitochondrial uptake of tpp in exchange for tmp (marobbio et al. 2002).
it is generally assumed that tpp transport is of little, if
any, importance in maintaining thiamine homeostasis,
and it has been found that yeast (nosaka et al. 1989)
and rat hepatocytes (yoshioka et al. 1983) are unable
to take up tpp. as a consequence, thiamine pyrophosphokinase (tpk) is thought to be essential in every cell
since it converts thiamine into tpp. disruption of the
gene coding for tpk in s. cerevisiae (thi80; nosaka et
al. 1993) or in schizosaccharomyces pombe (tnr3; fankhauser et al. 1995) is lethal. although human tpk has
been cloned (nosaka et al. 2001), so far no multi-cellular organism that carries a mutation in the tpk gene
has been described.
here, we describe a partial loss-of-function mutation
(qm162) in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans gene
that encodes thiamine pyrophosphokinase (tpk-1). tpk-1
(qm162) was identified in a genetic screen for maternaleffect mutations resulting in slow development and behavior. like other mutations found in this screen (hekimi et al. 1995), tpk-1(qm162) also affects a number of
biological rates and rhythms, including the rate of aging
(table 1). we take advantage of this mutation to show
that, in c. elegans, tpp can be taken up directly from
the environment and appears to be carried over plasma
membranes without being converted into thiamine. we
also demonstrate a role for thiamine deficiency in the
phenotype of mutants of the sodium/potassium atpase
encoded by the eat-6 gene in c. elegans (davis et al.
1995), which provides genetic evidence that thiamine
absorption requires the activity of the na⫹/k⫹ atpase.

materials and methods
materials and media: thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate were purchased from sigma. thie ⫺ bacteria were cultured for 16 hr in m9-metal medium without thiamine, sufficiently depleting bacteria of thiamine. control bacteria were
cultured similarly, except that thiamine (0.5 ␮g/ml) was present in the medium. subsequently, bacteria were plated on m9metal plates containing 5 ␮g/ml cholesterol, with or without
thiamine (0.5 ␮g/ml).
cosmid zk637 was kindly provided by alan coulson. the

cdna clone yk903f12 was kindly provided by y. kohara. the
ppd95.77 vector was provided by a. fire.
nematode and bacterial strains: c. elegans strains were cultured on op50 bacteria at 20⬚ as described by brenner (1974).
the n2 (bristol) strain was used as wild type. mutant strains
analyzed include tpk-1(qm162), eat-4(ky5), and eat-6(ad601). thie
knock-out bacteria (genotype thie::tn5kan-i-scei at position
307 in minus orientation) were kindly provided by the escherichia coli genome project at the university of wisconsin-madison.
isolation and identification of tpk-1(qm162): tpk-1(qm162)
was isolated in a genetic screen for maternal-effect mutations
affecting development and behavior (wong et al. 1995) and
was backcrossed four times with n2. to test if wild-type
zk637.9 could rescue the tpk-1(qm162) phenotypes, a 2.4-kb
fragment including the zk637.9 coding sequence and 425
bp upstream sequence was amplified from genomic dna by
nested pcr using outer forward primer cattttcgccaat
attttgtatttc, inner forward primer accgttgaat
aaataagttgattgc, and reverse primer acattccaatc
atgtttgattttct. the pcr product was gel purified and
co-injected into the germline of tpk-1(qm162) with the rol-6
(su1006) marker plasmid. all tpk-1 phenotypes tested (growth
rate, brood size, defecation cycle length) were rescued, demonstrating that the transgene complements the tpk-1(qm162)
mutation. to identify the nature of the tpk-1(qm162) mutation,
the above-mentioned primers were used to amplify zk637.9
from tpk-1 mutant dna and the resulting fragment was sequenced.
construction of translational fusions: the zk637.9 coding
sequence was amplified by pcr from genomic dna with the
forward primer acg acg tgc gac gtc gac gat tct
cat cac aag tgg containing the sal i restriction site
(underlined) and the reverse primer agc acg atc  xxxg873xxx 
ggt acc gaa tca agt ttg tag acc containing the kpni
restriction site (underlined). after digestion, the 1.3-kb sal i/
kpni fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites in the
ppd95.77 vector (obtained from a. fire) under the control
of the myo-3 and the myo-2 promoters.
sequencing of cdna: vector pme18s-fl containing cdna
clone yk903f12 (obtained from y. kohara) was sequenced
using the forward primer 5⬘-gta ata cga ctc act ata
ggg cgt cca tct gcc tga tca aga c and the reverse
primer 5⬘-gta ata cga ctc act ata ggg ctc caa ttg
aac tga cga t (both contain the t7 promoter that is not
used). the obtained sequence data covered the entire coding
sequence of tpk-1.
transgenic worms: tpk-1 constructs were micro-injected in various concentrations into tpk-1 mutant worms with 150 ng/␮l coinjection marker construct prf4 [containing rol-6(su1006)] to
create transgenic lines.
scoring phenotypes: defecation and pharyngeal pumping
cycle lengths of singled young adults were scored at 20⬚ as
described (wong et al. 1995). four successive defecation cycles
were timed. pharyngeal pumping rate was scored by measuring
the number of pumps in 60 sec. to determine brood size, young
adults were singled and transferred each day to a new plate
until they stopped laying eggs. progeny were counted on each
of the plates.
o2 consumption rate: worms were cultured at 20⬚ as described (feng et al. 2001). developmentally synchronized
young adults were collected and washed with m9. tubes were
left on the table to allow the worms to sink for 5–10 min.
the supernatant was removed as much as possible without
removing worms. oxygen consumption was analyzed using a
clark electrode. a total of 100 ␮l of the worms was put in
the chamber and the volume was adjusted with m9 buffer.
measurements were taken for 6 min.

were pulled on a sutter p-97 pipette puller (sutter instrument,
novato, ca). epgs were digitized using a digitdata1322a and
recorded using clampex 8.1 software (axon instruments,
union city, ca). recordings were formatted and digitally
filtered using a 1-khz gaussian filter with clampfit 8.1 software
(axon instruments).
results

identification tpk-1(qm162): the tpk-1 mutant was isolated in a genetic screen for maternal-effect mutations
affecting development and behavior (clk mutants),
which was similar to a previously described screen (hekimi et al. 1995) and whose results will be described in
detail elsewhere. the qm162 mutation was mapped to
lg iii between sma-2 and unc-69 and found to be genetically inseparable from unc-32 (mapping data have been
deposited at http://www.wormbase.org). cosmids from
the corresponding genomic region were injected to
assay for rescue of the mutant phenotypes. injection
of zk637 allowed for phenotypic rescue and predicted
genes on the rescuing cosmid were amplified by pcr and
assayed by injection. injection of a 2.4-kb pcr amplicon
(coordinates: iii:8911625 to 8914002) containing the pre-

dicted gene zk637.9 was sufficient to rescue the developmental and behavioral phenotypes of the mutant strain
(data not shown). to reveal the correct gene structure,
an apparently full-length cdna clone (yk903f12, kindly
provided by y. kohara) that had sequences in common
with zk637.9 was sequenced. the sequence of yk903f12
(accession no. ay513235) indicated that it encodes a
228-amino-acid protein similar to tpk in vertebrates,
plants, and yeast, which converts thiamine into the essential cofactor tpp. we identified the tpk-1(qm162) mutation (cys67 → tyr) by resequencing the gene from the
mutant strain. multiple alignment of c. elegans, human,
mouse, fruit fly, and yeast tpk shows strong sequence
conservation of the protein from yeast to humans (figure 1).
phenotype of tpk-1(qm162) mutants: clk mutants, including tpk-1(qm162), are characterized by a general
slowdown and deregulation of physiological rhythms,
including a lengthening of life span. table 1 summarizes
a variety of physiological traits that are affected in tpk-1
(qm162) mutants. the average cycle lengths of adult
rhythmic behaviors such as defecation and pharyngeal
pumping are almost doubled. other timed life-cycle
phases, including embryonic and postembryonic development, are of increased duration. tpk-1 mutants have
a substantially increased life span, which is due primarily
to an increase in adult life span (table 1). in addition,

data are from wong et al. (1995).

tpk-1 mutants can be maternally rescued. this means
that tpk-1 homozygous mutant progeny from a heterozygous mother (tpk-1/⫹) are phenotypically wild type. although all phenotypes appear rescued, only postembryonic development and the defecation cycle measured
were exactly quantified (table 1).
clk-1 mutants, which are the most extensively characterized animals with a clk phenotype, look generally
healthy and do not show any obvious morphological
defects in spite of the slowdown and deregulation of physiological rhythms. however, tpk-1 mutants, although
anatomically and behaviorally mostly normal, appear
slimmer and more transparent than wild-type worms. additionally, tpk-1 mutants tend to clump in groups and avoid
the bacterial lawn. these behaviors are reminiscent of eat
mutants, which have impaired pharyngeal pumping and
consequently impaired food intake (avery 1993). since
tpp is an essential cofactor for several key metabolic
enzymes including mitochondrial pyruvate decarboxylase and ␣-ketoglutarate decarboxylase, reduced availability of tpp due to the tpk-1(qm162) mutation should
affect mitochondrial metabolism. however, we did not
observe a difference in oxygen consumption rates between wild-type (n2; 28.12 ⫾ 4.09 nmol/min/mg protein) and tpk-1 mutant worms (29.36 ⫾ 4.47 nmol/min/
mg protein). the numbers represent the means ⫾ standard error of two independent experiments with three
independent samples measured per experiment. this
suggests that the phenotype produced by the tpk-1
(qm162) mutation is not mediated by a decrease in electron transport and atp synthesis. this is consistent with
previous studies of animals with reduced electron transport that are large and dark, rather than small and
transparent like tpk-1 mutants (feng et al. 2001). this

means that the levels of tpp present in tpk-1 mutants
are not limiting for mitochondrial function.
c. elegans requires thiamine from food: animals, unlike plants and micro-organisms, depend on external
sources of thiamine to be able to produce tpp. in mammals, a thiamine-depleted diet eventually leads to severe
neurological defects. to establish the effect of thiamine
deficiency on c. elegans, wild-type worms at the l2, l3,
or l4 larval stage were cultured on thiamine-free plates
containing thiamine-depleted thie ⫺ bacteria, which
cannot produce any thiamine and fail to grow without
exogenous thiamine. to grow enough thie ⫺ bacteria
to feed worms, we grew thie ⫺ bacteria in thiaminedeficient medium until they stopped growing. control
worms were cultured under the same conditions except
that thiamine was added to the plates (see materials
and methods). on the thiamine-deficient plates, the
wild-type worms (n2) developed into normal-looking
gravid adults that behave normally. after 2 days, the
pharyngeal pumping rate, a behavior that is affected in
tpk-1 mutants, was still similar to that of the controls
(⬎230 pumps) as well as to that of n2 worms fed on
op50 bacteria (the standard bacterial strain). however,
thiamine deficiency becomes apparent in the f1 progeny
of animals grown continuously on deficient bacteria.
although f1 progeny develop into adults, these animals
remain very small and slim and they fail to produce
progeny. thus wild-type animals can subsist on accumulated thiamine although the thiamine is eventually depleted in their progeny.
unlike wild-type worms, young adult tpk-1 mutants
that are challenged with a thiamine-depleted diet display symptoms of thiamine deficiency immediately: after
2 days the pharyngeal pumping rate is slowed down

have no effect on the wild type. for tpk-1 mutants only tpp had a significant effect on the defecation rate. for pumping rate,
both thiamine (p ⬎ 0.02) and tpp had a significant effect. however, the effect of thiamine is very small. for brood size, both
thiamine and tpp appear to have an effect on mutant animals but we could detect only a statistically significant effect for tpp
(p ⬍ 0.01).

from 140 to 90 pumps/minute, and the worms start
looking sick and die after ⵑ1 week. although they produce f1 eggs, none of these hatch. the strong effect
seen in tpk-1 worms suggests that these mutants are not
able to subsist on previously accumulated thiamine. this
is in line with the fact that most thiamine inside organisms is in the form of tpp. thus, low activity of tpk
might result in low levels of thiamine and tpp.
the tpk-1 mutant phenotypes are caused by thiamine
pyrophosphate deficiency: the strong phenotype of tpk-1
mutants implies that worms normally need to produce
tpp endogenously to remain healthy. to determine
directly the relationship between tpk-1 phenotypes and
tpp, tpk-1 mutants were exposed to high concentrations
of tpp by soaking a mix of l4 larvae and young adults
in m9 buffer containing 2.5 mm tpp for 30 min. the
pharyngeal pumping and defecation cycle lengths of
the soaked worms were scored 24 hr later. figure 2
illustrates the profound rescuing effect of tpp on rhythmic behaviors and brood size of tpk-1 mutant worms. in
addition, the rescued worms look darker and bigger,
suggesting that they are healthier. in principle, it is
possible that tpp is first dephosphorylated inside the
worm before cellular uptake, as is the case in the mammalian intestine. however, exposing worms to 2.5 mm
thiamine has no effect on pharyngeal pumping and
defecation cycle length and only a very slight effect on
brood size, demonstrating that tpp is taken up and
used directly. neither thiamine nor tpp has any effect
on wild-type worms (figure 2).
tpk-1(qm162) results in a partial loss-of-function of
tpk: the finding that tpp but not thiamine supplementation rescues tpk-1 mutants indicates that qm162 is
a loss-of-function mutation. however, this result also
means that tpk-1(qm162) might be a null mutation and
that the viability of mutants feeding on bacteria capable
of synthesizing tpp is due to dietary tpp uptake. to
establish whether tpk-1(qm162) is a full or partial lossof-function mutation we used a particular phenotype
associated with tpk-1(qm162). in the absence of food,
newly hatched worms arrest as l1 larvae, which allows

them to survive a prolonged period of starvation. when
food becomes available, the wild-type arrested larvae
resume normal development. however, tpk-1 mutant
worms tend to die within a few days as arrested l1
larvae or fail to resume development when placed in
the presence of food. to determine if this defect could
be rescued exogenously, tpk-1 l1 larvae were arrested
on plates containing thiamine or tpp but no bacteria.
each day, a sample of worms was transferred to a plate
with bacteria and their development was monitored. as
table 2 documents, the presence of either thiamine or
tpp in the plates on which the worms were arrested
allows tpk-1 l1 larvae to resume development after transfer to a food plate. thiamine appears to be as effective
as tpp, strongly suggesting that tpk-1(qm162) has residual activity and converts exogenous thiamine to tpp.
the inability of tpk-1 mutants to survive arrest and starvation without thiamine or tpp supplementation is likely
due to a reduced ability to store thiamine as tpp. it
also suggests that resuming growth after arrest requires
less tpp than the other phenotypes we have described
(e.g., pumping), which cannot be rescued by providing
thiamine.
tpk-1 functions cell nonautonomously: tpp is generally believed to be unable to cross cell membranes. thus,
given that tpp is essential for basic cellular metabolism,
tpk is expected to be required in every cell. however,
our observation that exogenous tpp can be taken up
by c. elegans and appears to have global effects on the
worm suggests that tpp can be transported without
previous dephosphorylation from the absorbing cells to
other cells in the body. thus, tpk-1 might function cell nonautonomously. to explore this, a tpk-1::gfp translational
fusion was expressed under the control of the myo-3 promoter (body-wall muscles) or the myo-2 promoter (pharyngeal muscles). in tpk-1 mutants that carry a [myo-3::tpk-1::
gfp] or [myo-2::tpk-1::gfp] transgenic array, gfp fluorescence is detected as expected in the body-wall muscles
or the pharyngeal muscles, respectively. however, in
both cases the construct profoundly rescued all tested
mutant phenotypes (table 3). thus, the rescue of phe-

notypes unrelated to the activity of a particular tissue
(e.g., pharyngeal pumping should be independent of
body-wall muscle function) suggests that tpk-1 functions
cell nonautonomously. however, extrachromosomal
arrays generally contain multiple copies of the gene,
which can result in overexpression. to exclude the possibility that the expression of the transgene was not
confined to a particular tissue because of overexpression, we used the myo-2::tpk-1::gfp construct in the following way. we produced transgenic arrays by injecting
very low concentrations of rescuing dna at a concentration so low (1 ng/␮l) that two out of three independent
transgenic lines were not rescued, presumably because
they did not contain a full-length copy of the construct.
the third line, however, was rescued for both the pharyngeal pumping rate and the defecation cycle length,
which is not dependent on pharyngeal muscle function.
furthermore, the worms of this line have a general wildtype appearance. together, these observations strongly

suggest that tpk-1 functions cell nonautonomously, suggesting that tpp can be transported from one cell or
tissue to others.
slow pumping in tpk-1 mutants is due to failure to
trigger muscle contraction: to better understand the
slow-pumping phenotype of tpk-1 mutants, we examined
pumping by electrophysiological methods. we recorded
epgs, extracellular recordings that measure changes in
the membrane potential of pharyngeal muscles during
rhythmic pumping of the pharynx (raizen and avery
1994; davis et al. 1995). normally, the rate of pumping
in the presence of food is determined by the activity of
the marginal cells (mc) pacemaker motor neurons. we
found that in tpk-1 mutants, in contrast to what is observed in the wild type, the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps) produced by the mc motor neurons
do not always trigger muscle contraction (figure 3, a
and b), which can explain the slow-pumping rate of the
mutants. indeed, treatment of mutants with tpp rescues

the action of the two mc motor neurons on the
muscle. e2 reflects the depolarization of the muscle and the initiation of the action potential in
response to e1. r1 indicates the repolarization
of the muscle that terminates the muscle action
potential. (a) typical recording from wild-type
muscle. (b) typical recording from a tpk-1 mutant
and a tpk-1 mutant treated with tpp. the smaller
amplitude of the spikes reflects the smaller size
of the tpk-1 mutant animals. many epsps (marked
by an asterisk) failed to elicite a muscle action
potential. this phenotype is fully rescued by treatment with tpp. (c) typical recording from an
eat-6(ad601) mutant without and with treatment
with thiamine. in the untreated mutant the r1
spike is very small compared to those in the wild
type, and this phenotype is not rescued by treatment with thiamine, although thiamine rescues
the pumping rate.

the coupling between epsp and contraction so that
virtually every epsp triggers a muscle contraction (figure 3b). inefficient triggering of muscle action potentials is characteristic of mutants, such as snt-1, that have
compromised neurotransmitter release (raizen et al.
1995). however, reduced muscle excitability could also
explain this phenotype.
all currents in the epg traces of the tpk-1 worms are
smaller because tpk-1 worms are starved and small worms
have smaller amplitude epg currents. this is because
the epg measures capacitative currents and the capacitance of the cell decreases with size. however, this does
not affect our conclusions. even in normal small worms
(i.e., larvae) a normal small epsp triggers a pump almost
every time.
thiamine redistribution after uptake requires the activity of naⴙ/kⴙ-atpase: although uptake of thiamine
appears to be driven by tpk-dependent phosphorylation, export of thiamine from cells is believed to require
the activity of na⫹/k⫹-atpase (laforenza et al. 1993).
in c. elegans, the ␣-subunit of this enzyme is encoded
by the eat-6 gene (davis et al. 1995), and partial lossof-function mutants in this gene have decreased na⫹/

k⫹-atpase activity (shima et al. 1998) and display slow,
abnormal pumping (avery 1993). we treated eat-6 mutants by soaking them in thiamine or tpp and found that
both compounds dramatically improved the pharyngeal
pumping rate of the mutants (figure 4). in contrast,
no effect was seen on mutants (ky5) of the eat-4 gene,
which encodes a vesicular glutamate transporter (bellocchio et al. 2000). this suggests that at least part of
the phenotype of eat-6 mutants is due to a deficiency in
thiamine. a likely explanation is that, after thiamine is
taken up by competent cells, for example, in the gut,
it cannot be reexported to the rest of the body because
of the defect in na⫹/k⫹-atpase.
eat-6 mutants display an electrophysiological phenotype in which the r spike, which corresponds to the
repolarization phase of the action potential just before
the muscles relax, is dramatically reduced (davis et
al. 1995; figure 4). however, treatment with thiamine,
which rescues the pumping-rate phenotype (figure 3),
does not rescue the electrophysiological phenotype.
thus the muscle defect that results in the reduced r
spike is not a result of thiamine deficiency and does not
explain the reduced pumping rate. decreased levels of

10 animals for each strain). the effect of thiamine on tpk-1
mutants is small but significant (p ⬎ 0.02). the effects of both
thiamine (p ⬍ 0.001) and tpp (p ⬍ 0.001) on eat-6 mutants
are highly significant, but there is no significant effect of either
compound on eat-4 (p ⫽ 0.18 and p ⫽ 0.72, for thiamine and
tpp, respectively).

tpp in the nervous system, specifically in the pacemaker
neurons, might explain the decreased pumping rate in
eat-6 mutants. this would be consistent with findings in
vertebrates that the nervous system is the first tissue to
be affected by thiamine deficiency.
discussion

thiamine and tpk-1: thiamine plays an essential role
in energy metabolism in the form of tpp in all organisms. to synthesize tpp, animals have to extract thiamine from food, which is converted into the active coenzyme by tpk. this enzyme is essential for viability in
yeast and probably in other species as well, since no
salvation pathway for tpp is known to exist. we identified tpk-1(qm162) in a screen for c. elegans mutants with
a slow life cycle and behavioral rhythms and used positional cloning to discover that the gene encodes c. elegans tpk.
function of dietary thiamine: symptoms associated
with thiamine deficiency are being studied in organisms
such as rats and mice. rats that are fed a thiaminedeficient diet for 30 days start to show the first signs
of thiamine deficiency, that is, anorexia, after 3 weeks
(pires et al. 2001). in mice, anorexia sets in after 10–15
days of thiamine depletion (nakagawasai et al. 2001).
by feeding wild-type worms a thiamine-depleted diet
and monitoring growth and reproduction, we show that
c. elegans, like other animal species, needs dietary thiamine for survival. moreover, tpk-1(qm162) mutants are
hypersensitive to thiamine depletion. when tpk-1 adults
are fed a thiamine-depleted diet they immediately display a significantly reduced feeding rate and start dying

after only a few days. on the other hand, although tpk-1
mutants presumably have reduced levels of tpp (see
results), their behavioral and developmental phenotypes are not improved by excess thiamine (figure 2).
together, these observations suggest that cellular uptake of thiamine in worms is coupled to tpk activity as
in other organisms (lumeng et al. 1979; yoshioka 1984;
bettendorff and wins 1994; bettendorff 1995),
which is why tpk-1 mutants are hypersensitive to thiamine depletion. however, the amount of thiamine that
tpk-1 mutants can extract from normal food is not limiting and allows for maximal activity of the mutant tpk
in most tissues, which is why the tpk-1 mutant phenotype
cannot be improved by pharmacological amounts of
thiamine, except when endogenous thiamine is depleted by developmental arrest (table 2).
uptake and transport of tpp in c. elegans: dietary
thiamine, which consists mostly of tpp, is converted
into thiamine in the mammalian intestine before absorption. in fact, tpp is thought to be produced only
where it is used, and its transport is thought to be of
minor, if any, importance in thiamine metabolism. dephosphorylation of dietary tpp is likely to occur as well
in the c. elegans intestine, given that worms need tpk
activity to maintain a wild-type physiology. this would
suggest that direct uptake and utilization of dietary tpp
is not possible, is insufficient, or is prevented by rapid
dephosphorylation. yet, we show that tpk-1 mutants are
rescued by soaking in pharmacological amounts of tpp
but not of thiamine. this indicates that tpp can be
taken up directly without being dephosphorylated.
all aspects of the phenotype of tpk-1 mutants improve
upon tpp treatment, which indicates that it is not only
taken up in the intestine, but also efficiently distributed
through the worms. this finding is surprising, given
that it is believed that only thiamine but not tpp can
be exported from cells (yoshioka et al. 1983; nosaka
et al. 1989). to rule out the possibility that the effect
of soaking is merely an artifact induced by the extremely
high amounts of tpp, we tested whether expression of
wild-type tpk-1 in a single tissue could rescue the entire
animal. as shown in table 3, extrachromosomal expression of tpk-1::gfp restricted to the pharyngeal muscles
rescues not only pharyngeal pumping, but also unrelated phenotypes such as the defecation cycle, as well
as the overall aspect of the animal. this strongly indicates that tpp produced in the pharyngeal muscles is
efficiently distributed throughout the worm by endogenous physiological mechanisms. taken together, these
findings show that tpp can be effectively transported
across plasma membranes in c. elegans.
the tpk-1 gene lies in an operon whose first gene is
unc-32 (blumenthal et al. 2002), a gene whose pattern
of expression has been studied in detail (oka et al. 2001;
pujol et al. 2001). the promoter of this operon directs
expression to many tissues, including to the entire embryo, the intestine, the excretory cell, the pharynx, the

thiamine pyrophosphate in nematodes

somatic gonad, the nervous system, and various hypodermal cells. however, the operon appears not to be
expressed in the body-wall muscle cells and in the main
hypodermal multinucleated hypodermal cell. in addition, tpk-1 might be expressed in fewer tissues because
of post-transcriptional controls. thus, the tpp transport
system might be essential to provide tpp that has been
synthesized elsewhere to muscle cells, the hypodermis,
and, possibly, other tissues.
redistribution of dietary thiamine: while uptake of thiamine into cells is energized by the activity of tpk, export of thiamine requires the activity of na⫹/k⫹-atpase
(laforenza et al. 1993). we found that this also appears
to be the case in c. elegans, as the phenotype of eat-6
mutants, which have partially impaired na⫹/k⫹-atpase
function, is rescued by thiamine. it suggests that thiamine redistribution to other tissues after uptake from
dietary sources by the intestine might be one of the
cellular processes that is most sensitive to a partial reduction of the function of na⫹/k⫹-atpase. it also indicates
that part of the eat-6 phenotype is due to thiamine (and
therefore tpp) deficiency.
tpp transport may also be important in mammals:
tpp appears to be transported rather efficiently between cells in c. elegans. does similar transport occur
in mammals and, if so, how important is it for thiamine
homeostasis? our observations suggest that all the basic
aspects of thiamine metabolism previously described in
mammalian systems exist in c. elegans as well. furthermore, mammalian genes known to be directly involved
in thiamine metabolism, including the two thiamine
transporters and tpk, have close homologs in c. elegans.
an inability to transport tpp across membranes was
directly demonstrated only in yeast and liver cells (yoshioka et al. 1983; nosaka et al. 1989). more circumstantial evidence that tpp does not cross membranes includes the observations that tpp can be detected in
erythrocytes but not in blood serum (tallaksen et al.
1997) and that dietary tpp is taken up in the form of
thiamine. however, what we observe in worms might
nonetheless be a phylogenetically common mechanism.
indeed, there have been early observations that ehrlich
ascites carcinoma cells rapidly take up labeled thiamine
and that after 2 hr practically all the labeled thiamine
is in the phosphorylated form, including that in the
medium (menon and quastel 1966). more recently,
mouse leukemia cells were also shown to transport tpp
through plasma membranes. thiamine uptake appears
to be impaired in thiamine-responsive megaloblastic
anemia syndrome patients. yet the symptoms of these
patients appear to be distinct from those induced by
dietary thiamine depletion (oishi et al. 2002). possibly,
the basis of this disease is impaired tpp transport.
