abstract
there are three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) subtypes which are
commonly designated ppar alpha, ppar gamma and ppar beta/delta. ppar alpha activation
increases high density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol synthesis, stimulates "reverse" cholesterol
transport and reduces triglycerides. ppar gamma activation results in insulin sensitization and
antidiabetic action. until recently, the biological role of ppar beta/delta remained unclear.
however, treatment of obese animals by specific ppar delta agonists results in normalization of
metabolic parameters and reduction of adiposity. combined treatments with ppar gamma and
alpha agonists may potentially improve insulin resistance and alleviate atherogenic dyslipidemia,
whereas ppar delta properties may prevent the development of overweight which typically
accompanies "pure" ppar gamma ligands. the new generation of dual-action ppars – the glitazars,
which target  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1805xxx  (like muraglitazar and tesaglitazar) are on deck in latestage clinical trials and may be effective in reducing cardiovascular risk, but their long-term clinical
effects are still unknown. a number of glitazars have presented problems at a late stage of clinical
trials because of serious side-effects (including  xxxd3072xxx  and farglitazar). the old and well known
lipid-lowering fibric acid derivative  xxxd331xxx  is the first clinically tested pan – (alpha, beta/delta,
gamma) ppar activator. it is the only pan-ppar activator with more than a quarter of a century of
therapeutic experience with a good safety profile. therefore,  xxxd331xxx  could be considered
(indeed, as a "post hoc" understanding) as an "archetype" of a clinically tested pan-ppar ligand.
 xxxd331xxx  leads to considerable raising of hdl cholesterol and reduces triglycerides, improves
insulin sensitivity and reduces blood glucose level, significantly lowering the incidence of
cardiovascular events and new diabetes in patients with features of metabolic syndrome. clinical
evidences obtained from  xxxd331xxx -based studies strongly support the concept of pan-ppar
therapeutic approach to conditions which comprise the metabolic syndrome. however, from a
biochemical point of view,  xxxd331xxx  is a ppar ligand with a relatively low potency. more powerful
new compounds with pan-ppar activity and proven long-term safety should be highly effective in
a clinical setting of patients with coexisting relevant lipid and glucose metabolism disorders.

peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) are
nuclear hormone receptors, i.e. ligand-dependent intracellular proteins that stimulate transcription of specific
genes by binding to specific dna sequences following
activation by the appropriate ligand. when activated, the
transcription factors exert several functions in development and metabolism. there are three ppar subtypes
which are the products of distinct genes and are commonly designated ppar alpha, ppar gamma and ppar
beta/delta, or merely delta [1-4]. the ppars usually heterodimerize with another nuclear receptor, the 9- xxxd2404xxx  receptor (rxr), forming a complex that interacts
with specific dna response elements within promoter
regions of target genes. when activated by agonist ligand
binding, this heterodimer complex recruits transcription
coactivators and regulates the transcription of genes
involved in the control of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism [1-4].
ppar alpha, activated by polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  and
fibrates, is implicated in regulation of lipid metabolism,
lipoprotein synthesis and metabolism and inflammatory
response in liver and other tissues. ppar alpha is highly
expressed in tissues with high fatty acid oxidation (like
liver, kidney and heart muscle), in which it controls a
comprehensive set of genes that regulate most aspects of
lipid catabolism. like several other nuclear hormone
receptors, it heterodimerizes with rxr alpha to form a
transcriptionally competent complex [1-3,5]. in addition,
 xxxg1805xxx  is expressed in vascular endothelial cells,
smooth muscle cells, monocyte/macrophages and t lymphocytes. ppar alpha activation increase hdl cholesterol
synthesis, stimulate "reverse" cholesterol transport and
reduce triglycerides [1-3,6].
ppar gamma plays important roles in the regulation of
proliferation and differentiation of several cell types,
including adipose cells. it has the ability to bind a variety
of small lipophilic compounds derived from both metabolism and nutrition. these ligands, in turn, determine
cofactor recruitment to ppar gamma, regulating the transcription of genes in a variety of complex metabolic pathways. ppar gamma is highly expressed in adipocytes,
where it mediates differentiation, promotes lipid storage,
and, as a consequence, is thought to indirectly improve
insulin sensitivity and enhance glucose disposal in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle [7-9]. its activation by
drugs of the glitazones (thiazolidinediones) group results
in insulin sensitization and antidiabetic action.
until recently, the biological role of ppar delta remained
unclear. animal studies revealed that ppar delta play an
important role in the metabolic adaptation of several tissues to environmental changes. treatment of obese ani-

mals by specific ppar delta agonists results in
normalization of metabolic parameters and reduction of
adiposity. ppar delta appeared to be implicated in the
regulation of fatty acid burning capacities of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue by controlling the expression of
genes involved in fatty acid uptake, beta-oxidation and
energy uncoupling. ppar delta is also implicated in the
adaptive metabolic response of skeletal muscle to endurance exercise by controlling the number of oxidative
myofibers, inducing so and enhancing fatty acid catabolism in muscular tissue [3,6,10]. moreover, recent studies
revealed that ligand activation of these receptors is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and elevated hdl
levels thus demonstrating promising potential for targeting ppar delta in the treatment of obesity, dyslipidemias
and type 2 diabetes [11].

clinical studies of ppar ligands
fibric acid derivatives (fibrates) are ppar alpha ligands.
fibrates have been used in clinical practice for more than
four decades as a class of agents known to decrease triglyceride levels while substantially increasing hdl-cholesterol levels, with a limited but significant additional
lowering effect on low density lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol levels [5]. in addition to their favorable effects on
lipid profiles, evidence is mounting that benefits may also
stem from the anti-inflammatory and antiatherosclerotic
properties of these drugs [12,13]. although fibrate trials
have reported cardiovascular risk reduction in patients
with dyslipidemia, it is evident that the favorable alterations in plasma lipids can only partially explain the reduction in cardiovascular events in these studies. this is
particularly evident for high-risk individuals, such as diabetics or patients with insulin resistance who may have
more pronounced cardiovascular benefits [5,12-15].
glitazones are synthetic ppar gamma ligands with well
recognized effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. the
clinical use of these  xxxg1807xxx  agonists in type 2 diabetic patients leads to an improved glycemic control and
an inhanced insulin sensitivity, and – at least in animal
models – to a protective effect on pancreatic beta-cell
function. glitazones may also have cardiovascular benefits. animal models of atherosclerosis have shown that
these drugs reduce the extent of atherosclerotic lesions
and inhibit macrophage accumulation. clinical studies
have also shown that these drugs improve the lipid profile
of patients at risk of developing atherosclerosis and
reduce circulating levels of inflammatory markers [16-18].
however, they can produce adverse effects, generally mild
or moderate, but some of them (mainly peripheral edema
and weight gain) may lead to treatment cessation.
currently, clinical studies regarding ppar delta ligands
are lacking. given the results obtained with animal mod-

els, ppar delta agonists may have therapeutic usefulness
in metabolic syndrome by increasing fatty acid consumption in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue [19]. probably,
weight reduction could be expected as well.

insulin sensitivity and the blood lipid profile and probably reduce the risk of long-term cardiovascular complications. in addition, we can expect prevention of overweight
development due to its  xxxg1806xxx /delta properties.

dual and pan-ppar co-agonism

so, which are the data regarding  xxxd331xxx  administration? in a large trial in 1568 men with lower extremity
arterial disease,  xxxd331xxx  reduced the severity of intermittent claudication for up to three years [34]. in general,
the incidence of coronary heart disease in patients on  xxxd331xxx  has tended to be lower, but this tendency did not
reach statistical significance. however,  xxxd331xxx  had
significantly reduced the incidence of non-fatal coronary
events, particularly in those aged <65 years at entry, in
whom all coronary events may also be reduced [34]. in
two other independent studies  xxxd331xxx  decreased the
rate of progression of coronary atherosclerosis and
decreased coronary events rate [35,36]. in the the  xxxd331xxx  infarction prevention (bip) study an overall trend of
a 9.4% reduction of the incidence of primary end point
(fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or sudden death)
was observed. the reduction in the primary end point in
459 patients with high baseline triglycerides (200 mg/dl
or more) was significant [37].

combined treatments with ppar gamma and alpha agonists may potentially improve insulin resistance and alleviate atherogenic dyslipidemia, whereas ppar delta
properties may prevent the development of overweight
which typically accompanies "pure" ppar gamma ligands
like glitazones. with extended use, it is hoped that these
effects will reduce the risk of long-term cardiovascular
complications. ppar alpha and gamma stimulation play
complementary roles in the prevention of atherosclerosis.
cholesterol accumulation in macrophages located in the
endothelium is a crucial step in the formation of atherosclerosis. ppar gamma activation is necessary for the
efflux of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells. cholesterol taken up by hdl particles containing apolipoportein a-1 is transported to the liver to be disposed of
as bile acids [3,15,17]. ppar alpha agonists, on the other
hand, speed up the transfer of cholesterol from macrophages to particles containing apolipoportein a-1
[3,16,20].
thus, compounds with dual ppar alpha/ppar gamma
activity appear well-suited for the treatment of diabetic
patients with the additional risk factor of dyslipidemia.
the finding that ppar agonists play a role in regulating
other processes, such as inflammation, vascular function,
and vascular remodeling, has highlighted further potential indications for these agents [16,17]. so far, therefore,
a relatively high number of dual ppar alpha and ppar
gamma agonists have been described [3,21-25]. the new
generation of dual-action ppars – the glitazars which target  xxxg1807xxx  and ppar – alpha (muraglitazar and
tesaglitazar) are on deck in late-stage clinical trials and
may be effective in reducing cardiovascular risk, but their
long-term clinical effects are still unknown. a number of
glitazars have problems in late stage clinical trials because
of serious side-effects (including  xxxd3072xxx  and farglitazar).

the  xxxd331xxx  lessons: feasibility of dual and
pan-ppar co-agonism in a clinical setting
the old and well known lipid-lowering fibric acid derivative  xxxd331xxx  is the first clinically tested pan – (alpha,
beta/delta, gamma) ppar activator [26-33]. it is a sole
pan ppar activator with more than a quarter of a century
of a therapeutic experience with a good safety profile.
therefore,  xxxd331xxx  could be considered (indeed, as a
"post hoc" understanding) as an "archetype" of a clinically tested pan-ppar ligand. in patients with relevant
metabolic abnormalities it is expected to improve both

our new data demonstrate that  xxxd331xxx  can significantly reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction (mi)
in patients with metabolic syndrome [38]. the decrease in
mi incidence among patients on  xxxd331xxx  was reflected
in a trend to a late risk reduction of cardiac mortality during a long-term follow-up period. this tendency was
strengthened in patients with augmented features (at least
4 risk factors for metabolic syndrome) of metabolic syndrome (56% reduction of cardiac mortality during 8-year
follow-up). it is interesting that in patients without metabolic syndrome this favorable effect was not presented:
there was no significant difference in the cardiovascular
end-points between  xxxd331xxx  and placebo groups.
previous observations have shown beneficial effects of
 xxxd331xxx  on glucose and insulin metabolism [39-41].
recently, we have shown thata pharmacological intervention with  xxxd331xxx  decreased the incidence and delayed
the onset of type 2 diabetes in patients with impaired fasting glucose levels, and in obese patients over a long-term
follow-up period [42,43]. in the bip study the rates of
adverse events were similar in both study groups [37].
thus,  xxxd331xxx  treatment was safe in addition to being
effective in diabetes prevention. moreover, there was no
significant change in mean body mass index values in
either the  xxxd331xxx  or the placebo group during the follow-up [38,42,43].
therefore, the pan – (alpha, beta, gamma) ppar activator
 xxxd331xxx  leads to a considerable raising of hdl choles-

terol and a reduction of triglycerides, improves insulin
sensitivity and reduces blood glucose level, significantly
lowering the incidence of cardiovascular events and new
diabetes in patients with features of metabolic syndrome
over a long-term follow-up period. we conclude that clinical evidences obtained from  xxxd331xxx -based studies
strongly support the concept of a pan-ppar therapeutic
approach to conditions which comprise the metabolic
syndrome. however, from a biochemical point of view,
 xxxd331xxx  is ppar ligand with a relatively low potency.
we believe that more powerful compounds with panppar activity and proven long-term safety should be
highly effective in a clinical setting of patients with coexisting relevant lipid and glucose metabolism disorders.
