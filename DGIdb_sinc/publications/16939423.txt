summary
the effectiveness of  xxxd3255xxx  depends on the splitting of the diazo
bond in the molecule by the action of bacteria in the large bowel,
releasing the pharmacologically active moiety,  xxxd2579xxx .
the development of ph-dependent, delayed-release formulations of
 xxxd2579xxx  abolished the toxicity associated with the sulfapyridine part of  xxxd3255xxx .
 xxxd2579xxx  is now believed to act by activating a class of
nuclear receptors involved in the control of inflammation, cell proliferation, apoptosis and metabolic function, the c form of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. these receptors are expressed at
particularly high levels in colon epithelial cells, where their expression
appears to be at least in part stimulated by gut bacteria. other drugs
known to act via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c, such as
rosiglitazone and the selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c ligand gw1929, can be displaced from their binding sites on the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c molecule by  xxxd2579xxx  at concentrations of  xxxd2579xxx  that correspond
with the concentrations found in the lumen of ulcerative colitis patients
taking oral  xxxd2579xxx .
genetically engineered heterozygous knockout mice (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c) are particularly susceptible to colonic
inflammation, and inflammation is more severe in these mice, in
response to chemicals that induce experimental colonic ulcers. in these
experimental models,  xxxd2579xxx  is ineffective in peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-c mice. this new insight provides a
mechanistic foundation for the possibility that long-term treatment with
 xxxd2579xxx  can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in patients
with ulcerative colitis.

introduction
the oldest of the drugs used in ulcerative colitis (uc)
therapy,1  xxxd3255xxx  [ xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx )
linked to sulfapyridine by an azo bond], was for many
years the standard therapy after pivotal induction of
remission and maintenance trials in the 1960s.2, 3
however, up to one-third of patients are intolerant of
 xxxd3255xxx , the most common adverse effects being
nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, malaise or headaches.
less common effects include blood dyscrasias, male
infertility and skin rashes. these adverse effects are
considered to be due to the sulfapyridine moiety. this
has become apparent since it was recognized in 1977
that the therapeutic effect of  xxxd3255xxx  is due to
the release of the  xxxd2579xxx  moiety (figure 1) into the
lumen by the action of gut flora in the distal ileum
and colon.4 the sulfapyridine moiety is well absorbed
and reaches measurable concentrations in the blood,
hence the systemic adverse effects, whereas  xxxd2579xxx  is
less well absorbed from the distal bowel and reaches
high concentrations (1–100 mmol/l) in the lumen of
the colon and rectum.1, 5 side effects from the sulfapyridine moiety generally prevent the administration
of sufficient doses of  xxxd3255xxx  to produce effective
local concentrations of free  xxxd2579xxx .
oral administration of simple  xxxd2579xxx  tablets or capsules is ineffective because, although absorption is
poor, the surface area and transit time through the
small bowel is sufficient for most of the drug to be

absorbed whilst passing through the small bowel. as a
result, therapeutic concentrations are not reached in
the distal gut. the absorbed  xxxd2579xxx  is also inactivated
by acetylation in both the gut epithelium and liver.6
 xxxd2579xxx  is effective if applied topically in the form of
an enema. this is clearly less convenient for patients
than oral dosing and only applicable in distal colitis.
to address this shortcoming, a number of formulations
have been developed that deliver  xxxd2579xxx  in therapeutic
concentrations to the distal bowel (figure 1).7 the currently available oral preparations are  xxxd2579xxx ,
 xxxd2781xxx  and  xxxd282xxx .  xxxd2579xxx  comprises
 xxxd2579xxx  in a ph-dependent modified-release formulation that releases the active drug in the distal small
bowel and colon.  xxxd2781xxx  consists of two molecules
of  xxxd2579xxx  linked by an azo bond between their amino
groups. the complex is poorly absorbed but the azo
bond is split by flora in the distal small bowel and
colon, releasing two molecules of the active moiety,
 xxxd2579xxx .  xxxd282xxx  consists of  xxxd2579xxx  linked by an
azo bond to 4-amino-benzoyl-b-alanine, which is
again cleaved by flora in the distal bowel, releasing
 xxxd2579xxx  and the inert carrier 4-amino-benzoyl-balanine, which is poorly absorbed and hence causes
relatively few systemic adverse effects.

mechanism of action
in vitro,  xxxd2579xxx  shares many of the pharmacological
properties of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory

4 p. desreumaux and s. ghosh

drugs (nsaids) such as aspirin and the discovery of
its mechanism of action came from attempts to link its
anti-inflammatory action with the anti-neoplastic
action of nsaids. a number of different but not
mutually exclusive mechanisms of action have been
proposed, including inhibition of the activity of the
nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-jb) pathway,8 inhibition
of intestinal epithelial cell injury and apoptosis
induced by oxidative stress,9, 10 increase in the intestinal epithelial cell heat shock protein response,11 inhibition of colonic production of chemoattractant
leukotrienes12 and modulation of prostaglandin metabolism.13 the key to an integrated understanding of
the mechanism of action was the realization that the
anti-inflammatory actions of  xxxd2579xxx  produce effects
similar to activation of the c-form peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppar-c), e.g. modulation of
inflammatory cytokine production, modulation of
rela/p65 dephosphorylation, leading to decreased
transcriptional activity of nf-jb, and reduced synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.8, 14, 15 activation of ppar-c also has anti-tumourigenic effects
which manifest as anti-proliferative activities, pro-differentiation activities, pro-apoptotic activities, inhibition of the formation of aberrant crypts foci and
inhibition of the development of colon tumours. previous research had already shown that ppar-c suppresses tumour formation through a tumour-suppressor
gene at an early stage in the development of colon
tumours, thereby interfering with the wnt/b-catenin
signalling pathway (figure 2).16, 17
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors are members of the nuclear superfamily of receptors that are
involved in the transduction of metabolic and nutritional signals into transcription events.18 ppar-c molecules are expressed at particularly high levels in the
epithelium of the colon and adipose tissue, at least an
order of magnitude higher than in the small intestine
(figure 3).19 a variety of factors are responsible for
modulating the activity of ppar-c, but the most important activating factor for ppar-c in colon epithelial cells
appears to be bacteria in the gut lumen.20, 21
several pieces of evidence are now available that are
consistent with the hypothesis that  xxxd2579xxx  is effective
in uc by activating ppar-c. knockout mice that are
homozygous and lack ppar-c (ppar)/)) do not survive. however, heterozygous ppar-c mice do survive, but are susceptible to colonic inflammation.
furthermore, in models of induced colitis, e.g. in
response to dextran sodium sulphate, 2,4,6-trinitroben-

 xxxd2579xxx  and ppar-c activators inhibit the inflammatory response in these experimental models of uc,
whereas such agents are ineffective in uc models in
ppar-c mice.20
the effects of  xxxd2579xxx  on ppar-c in colonic epithelial
cells have also been investigated in vitro. most ppar-c
activators stimulate adipogenesis in preadipocyte cell
lines that express ppar-c, e.g. 3t3-l1 cells.22 both rosiglitazone and  xxxd2579xxx  induce a marked differentiation
of confluent 3t3-l1 cells, which can be detected as
enhanced intracytosolic accumulation of lipid.23 the
colon epithelial cell line ht-29 provides a more representative in vitro model than the adipocyte model. in
this model, both rosiglitazone and  xxxd2579xxx  induce the
expression of ppar-c in rna (figure 4), and the concentration of  xxxd2579xxx  that stimulates expression of
ppar-c is similar to the concentration in the colon
lumen after oral dosing with  xxxd2579xxx .23
it is now well established that in a range of cell types,
activation of ppar-c leads to a cascade of events that
include translocation of ppar-c to the nucleus, con(a)

formational changes within the ppar-c molecule and
recruitment of coactivators such as  xxxd1682xxx  receptorinteracting protein-205 (drip-205).24–30 like rosiglitazone,  xxxd2579xxx  stimulates translocation of ppar-c to the
nucleus in ht-29 cells and induces conformational
changes in the ppar-c molecule, although these changes are different from those seen after activation with
rosiglitazone.23 rosiglitazone and  xxxd2579xxx  also increase
the interaction between ppar-c and drip-205,
although the formation of ppar-c–drip-205 complexes is more pronounced with  xxxd2579xxx  than with rosiglitazone.23 it has also been shown that  xxxd2579xxx  increases
both the expression of ppar-c and its target gene neutrophie gleatinase associated lipocalvi (ngal) in cultured biopsies of human colon epithelial cells
(figure 5).23
in competitive binding studies,  xxxd2579xxx  competitively
displaces rosiglitazone and the selective ppar-c ligand
gw1929 from their binding sites on the ppar-c molecule at concentrations of  xxxd2579xxx  that correspond with
the concentrations found in the lumen of uc patients
taking oral  xxxd2579xxx .23, 31 computer models of the
binding of the  xxxd2579xxx  molecule to the docking domain
of ppar-c suggest an orientation that is similar to that
of the head group of rosiglitazone, with hydrogen
bonding between  xxxd2579xxx  and the four key amino acids
involved in the docking of rosiglitazone and activation
of the ppar-c molecule, namely his-323, his-449,
tyr-473 and ser-289.23 these four amino acids represent the minimum obligatory binding sites in the
binding domain of the ppar-c molecule.30 structure–

activity modelling also shows that  xxxd2579xxx  has an
optimal fit, whereas 3-asa and n-acetyl- xxxd2579xxx  do
not fit the docking site sufficiently well to activate
ppar-c (p. desreumaux, unpublished observation).
current research is directed towards identifying new
structures that fit and activate the ppar-c docking site
in the same way as  xxxd2579xxx .

mechanism for a possible
chemoprotective action of  xxxd2579xxx 
patients with uc are at increased risk of developing
colorectal cancer (crc),32, 33 and it is now well established that non-selective and cycloxygenase (cox-2)selective nsaids can prevent the development of crc.
because of the similarities between the anti-inflammatory actions of nsaids, coxibs and  xxxd2579xxx , it is logical
to look for a possible mechanism by which  xxxd2579xxx 
could protect against the development of crc in
patients with uc. this has been investigated in a
model of human colon cancer in which scid mice are
engrafted with ht-29 tumour cells. in this model,
 xxxd2579xxx , administered locally at concentrations consistent with those produced in the colon of uc patients

delivery
the efficacy of  xxxd2579xxx  in uc depends upon the presence of free  xxxd2579xxx  at a relatively high concentration
in the lumen of the colon. this has been achieved in a
number of ways, the traditional method being combining  xxxd2579xxx  with sulfapyridine to form  xxxd3255xxx 
(figure 1). the two other azo-bonded derivatives that
are in use are  xxxd2781xxx , which comprises two molecules of  xxxd2579xxx  joined together at their amine groups,
and  xxxd282xxx , in which  xxxd2579xxx  is linked to 4-aminobenzoyl-b-alanine (figure 1).

taking  xxxd2579xxx , significantly reduces the growth of
tumours and this effect is blocked by the selective
ppar-c antagonist  xxxd1216xxx  (figure 6).34
this anti-neoplastic effect of  xxxd2579xxx  is also mediated
through ppar-c via modification of the wnt/
b-catenin signalling pathway.35 large population-based
evidence from the general practice research database
in the uk suggests that  xxxd2579xxx  compounds can reduce
the risk of crc developing in patients with uc.36

is contained in a polymer-coated, ph-dependent-release
tablet that resists dissolution in the stomach and ileum,
but which dissolves in the ph environment of the colon,
allowing  xxxd2579xxx  to be delivered at high concentrations
to the colon epithelium.  xxxd2579xxx  itself is acetylated by
type 1 n-acetyltransferase (nat1) in the intestine and
liver with the rate of acetylation being normally distributed in the population. sulfapyridine in  xxxd3255xxx  is
acetylated by type 2 n-acetyltransferase ( xxxg1506xxx ), which
is deficient in the majority of caucasians (slow acetylators), which may account for some of the adverse effects
of  xxxd3255xxx .7, 37 the pharmacokinetics of absorption of  xxxd2579xxx  are non-linear and little useful information can be gained by studying blood concentrations, as
it is the concentration in the lumen of the colon, rather
than its concentration in the blood, that ultimately
determines the concentration of  xxxd2579xxx  in epithelial
cells. activity of nat1 and drug efflux pumps, such as
p-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated
protein-238 affect the mucosal concentration of  xxxd2579xxx .
however, there are large interindividual variations in
measured intraluminal concentrations of  xxxd2579xxx . factors that can influence the concentration in the colon
lumen include the oro–caecal transit time, which can
vary greatly between healthy individuals and those with
severe disease, and the ph in the gut lumen, which can
also vary greatly depending on the severity of disease,
as can disease extent and release profile of the drug. in
general, the evidence is that  xxxd3255xxx  is a less
effective  xxxd2579xxx  delivery system than ph-dependent
delayed-release formulations. there is no convincing
evidence that there are any meaningful differences
between the various delivery systems (table 1);7 the prescribing decision is based on the personal preferences of
both the prescribing doctor and the patient. however,
there is some in vitro evidence that may explain the
secretory diarrhoea seen with  xxxd2781xxx . in ussing
chamber experiments using ileal epithelium as the
membrane,  xxxd2781xxx  produced a concentrationdependent increase in ion secretion (figure 7).39
poor compliance has a major effect on the efficacy of
treatment and this complicates comparisons of different
treatments. for example, in a study of 98 patients with
uc, when asked about their medication-taking habits,
43% reported that they took less than 80% of the indicated dose of  xxxd2579xxx .40 however, 12% of patients had no
detectable  xxxd2579xxx  or n-acetyl- xxxd2579xxx  in their urine.
another 18% had lower than expected urinary concentrations of  xxxd2579xxx  and n-acetyl- xxxd2579xxx . self-reporting
identified only 66% of poor compliance. reasons for

on compliance because this approach has been introduced only recently.

future developments
possible developments include the design of new molecules that have the same mechanism of action as
 xxxd2579xxx  but which are more effective, for example close
chemical analogues of  xxxd2579xxx , or thiazolidinediones. it
is probable that tolerability will still have to be
achieved by selective delivery at high concentration to
the colonic epithelium to avoid systemic adverse
effects mediated through activation of ppar-c elsewhere in the body. one approach to improving the
delivery of active drug to its site of action could be
through new controlled-release formulations, such as
matrix formulations. other investigations are focusing

on ways to modify inflammation by interfering with
inflammatory mediators or the chemicals involved in
signalling processes. one promising approach is the
development of monoclonal antibodies against inflammatory cytokines, e.g. infliximab. another line of
research is the evaluation of other  xxxd2579xxx  delivery systems, such as  xxxd2738xxx -releasing  xxxd2579xxx .41

conclusions
the elucidation of the mechanism of action of  xxxd2579xxx 
has opened a new phase of research into the
management of uc by allowing a rational approach
based upon improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of the disease, and an understanding of the role of
ppar-c in both the disease and the action of  xxxd2579xxx 
and its derivatives.
