background and purpose
antidepressants are known to interact with the opioid system through mechanisms not completely understood. we previously
reported that tricyclic antidepressants act as agonists at distinct opioid receptors. here, we investigated the effect of the
atypical antidepressant  xxxd2637xxx  at cloned and native opioid receptors.

experimental approach
effects of  xxxd2637xxx  were examined in cho cells transfected with human opioid receptors, c6 glioma cells and rat brain
membranes by the use of radioligand binding and functional assays including the stimulation of [35s]gtpgs binding and
mapk phosphorylation.

key results
 xxxd2637xxx  displayed 12- and 18-fold higher affinity for k- than m- and d-opioid receptors respectively. in [35s]gtpgs assays,
 xxxd2637xxx  selectively activated k-opioid receptors. the agonist activity was antagonized by the selective k-opioid blocker
nor-binaltorphimine (nor-bni). the  xxxd2637xxx  analogue mirtazapine also displayed k-opioid agonist activity.  xxxd2637xxx  and
mirtazapine increased  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in cho cells expressing k-opioid receptors and c6 cells, and these effects were
antagonized by nor-bni. in rat striatum and nucleus accumbens,  xxxd2637xxx  stimulated [35s]gtpgs binding in a
nor-bni-sensitive manner with maximal effects lower than those of the full k-opioid agonists (–)-u50,488 and dynorphin a.
when combined,  xxxd2637xxx  antagonized the effects of the full k-opioid receptor agonists in [35s]gtpgs assays and reduced the
stimulation of p38 mapk and  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation by dynorphin a.

conclusions and implications
in different cell systems,  xxxd2637xxx  directly activates k-opioid receptors, displaying partial agonist activity at brain receptors.
thus, this property appears to be a common feature of different classes of antidepressants.

system. a number of studies have shown that the administration of opioid receptor antagonists reverses the antinociceptive effects of tcas (biegon and samuel, 1980; gray
et al., 1998; marchand et al., 2003; ozturk et al., 2006;

benbouzid et al., 2008a,b), and that tcas potentiate
morphine-induced analgesia in both animals and humans
(mico et al., 2006). moreover, in animal behavioural tests
predictive of antidepressant activity in humans, such as the
forced swimming and learned helplessness tests, the antidepressant action of tcas has been found to be antagonized by
blockade of opioid receptors (devoize et al., 1982; tejedorreal et al., 1995; besson et al., 1999). although these studies
support the involvement of the opioid system in the therapeutic activity of tcas, how these drugs act on opioid neurotransmission has not been completely elucidated.
we have recently reported that a number of tcas bind
to and activate distinct opioid receptors with a preference
for either d- or k-opioid receptor subtypes (onali et al.,
2010; receptor nomenclature follows alexander et al., 2011).
for instance,  xxxd160xxx  displayed higher potency and efficacy at d-opioid receptors, whereas amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine and imipramine showed higher agonist
activity at k-opioid receptors. at the m-opioid receptor, these
drugs had low affinity and no significant agonist activity.
from a pharmacodynamic point of view, the agonist activity at opioid receptors appears to be a unique property. in
fact, these drugs, besides blocking monoamine transporters,
have generally been found to behave as antagonists of neurotransmitter receptors (baldessarini, 2006). as the receptor
stimulation occurred at concentrations compatible with the
brain levels reached by these drugs, we proposed that the
direct agonist activity at opioid receptors could contribute
to the analgesic and antidepressant actions of tcas.
however, it remains to be examined whether this property
is typical of tcas or shared by other structurally different
antidepressants.
 xxxd2637xxx  is a tetracyclic compound that is approved for
the treatment of major depression in several countries. a
number of studies have indicated that  xxxd2637xxx  differs from
tcas not only chemically but also in its pharmacological
profile. in fact, unlike several tcas,  xxxd2637xxx  does not
inhibit neuronal 5-ht reuptake and in the brain is only
weakly active in blocking noradrenaline uptake (marshall,
1983). moreover,  xxxd2637xxx  shows low affinity for cholinergic
muscarinic receptors, but it has been found to block with
high-affinity 5-ht2 receptors, histamine h1 receptors and
a2-adrenoceptors (peroutka and snyder, 1981; richelson
and nelson, 1984). indeed, the antidepressant effect of
 xxxd2637xxx  is considered to mainly derive from the
blockade of pre-synaptic, auto- and hetero-a2-adrenoceptors,
with the consequent increase of noradrenergic and
5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurotransmission (marshall, 1983;
pinder, 1985). however, like tcas,  xxxd2637xxx  has been
reported to produce analgesia that was blocked by opioid
antagonists, indicating that also this antidepressant acts
through the opioid system (reichenberg et al., 1985; schreiber
et al., 1998). moreover,  xxxd2637xxx  has been shown to either
potentiate or antagonize the analgesic effect of the selective
k-opioid receptor agonist u-50 488 (ho and takemori, 1989).
in the present study, we investigated the actions of  xxxd2637xxx  on opioid receptors by using both heterologous and
homologous expression systems. we also examined the
effects of mirtazapine, as this newer antidepressant is structurally and pharmacologically similar to  xxxd2637xxx  (croom
et al., 2009).

methods
cell culture
cho-k1 cells (american type culture collection, manassas,
va, usa) were grown as a monolayer culture in tissue culture
flasks that were incubated at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere (5% co2) in ham’s f12 medium (invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca) containing l-glutamine and sodium bicarbonate and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs; invitrogen), 0.5%
penicillin/streptomycin. cho-k1 cells stably expressing the
human d-opioid receptor (cho/dop), k-opioid (cho/kop),
m-opioid receptor-1 (cho/mop) were generated as previously
described (olianas et al., 2006).
c6 rat glioma cells (european collection of cell cultures,
porton down, salisbury, uk) were grown in ham’s f12
supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.5% penicillin/
streptomycin and 10% fcs in a humidified 95% air and 5%
co2 at 37°c.

primary cultures of mouse neurons
all animal care and experimental procedures were in accordance with the european communities council directive of
november 24 1986 (86/609/eec) and with the principles of
laboratory animal care in italy (d.l. 116/92). all studies
involving animals are reported in accordance with the
arrive guidelines for reporting experiments involving
animals (mcgrath et al., 2010). the total of 44 animals were
used in the experiments described here.
cd-1 mice were obtained from harlan (udine, italy). oneday-old mice of both sexes were used to prepare primary
cultures of neuronal cells of mouse striatum and hippocampus. the animals were anaesthetized by hypothermia and
killed by decapitation. the dorsal and ventral striatum and the
dorsal hippocampus were dissected from coronal brain slices,
and the tissue fragments were incubated with 0.2% trypsin
(type ix from porcine pancreas; sigma aldrich, st. louis, mo,
usa) for 30 min at 30°c. thereafter, 1% soya bean trypsin
inhibitor and 0.1 mg· xxxg1167xxx  dnase type i (sigma aldrich) were
added, and the incubation was continued for additional
5 min. following trituration, the cell suspension was layered
on the top of a 4% bsa solution in complete neurobasal
medium and centrifuged at 1200¥ g for 10 min. the cells were
re-suspended in complete neurobasal medium and plated on
either glass coverslips (bellco brand, electron microscopy sciences, fort washington, pa, usa) or six-well plates pre-coated
with 0.01% l-poly-lysine (sigma aldrich) at the density of
1 ¥ 105 cells and 1 ¥ 106 per well respectively. cultures were
placed in a humidified incubator and maintained at 37°c in
5% co2. cells were used 8–10 days after plating.

cell membrane preparation
cells were washed with ice-cold pbs (ph 7.4), scraped into an
ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm hepes/naoh (ph 7.4) and
1 mm edta and lysed with a dounce tissue grinder. the cell
lysate was centrifuged at 1000¥ g for 2 min at 4°c. the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 32 000¥ g for 20 min

 xxxd2637xxx  agonism at k-opioid receptors

at 4°c. the pellet was re-suspended in homogenization buffer
at a protein concentration of 1.0–1.5 mg· xxxg1167xxx  and stored in
aliquots at -80°c.

cell treatments and cell extracts preparation
cho/kop cells and c6 glioma cells were serum-starved for
24 h or 48 h, respectively, whereas primary neuronal cultures
were incubated in the absence of b 27 supplement for 24 h.
the cells were then treated with the test agents as indicated in
the legends to figures, washed with ice-cold pbs and lysed by
scraping into pbs containing 0.1% sds, 1% nonidet p-40,
0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 2 mm edta, 2 mm egta, 4 mm
sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate,
10 mm sodium fluoride, 20 nm okadaic acid, 0.1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail
and 1 mm pmsf. the samples were stored at -80°c. aliquots
of cell extracts were taken for protein determination.
protein content was determined by the method of bradford (1976) using bsa as a standard.

dissection of brain regions and
membrane preparation
male sprague–dawley rats (200–300 g) (harlan) were used.
animals were maintained in a 12 h light/dark cycle with food
and water ad libitum. the dorsal striatum and nucleus
accumbens were rapidly microdissected from 300 mm brain
coronal slices as previously described (onali and olianas,
2002). freshly dissected tissue samples were homogenized in
an ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm hepes-naoh, 1 mm
edta (ph 7.40) using a teflon-glass tissue grinder. the
homogenate was centrifuged at 27 000¥ g for 20 min at 4°c.
the pellet was re-suspended in the same buffer at a protein
concentration of 0.8-1.0 mg· xxxg1167xxx  and stored at -80°c for
binding assays.

[35s]gtpgs binding assay
the binding of [35s]gtpgs was assayed in a reaction mixture
(final volume 100 ml) containing 25 mm hepes/naoh
(ph 7.4), 10 mm mgcl2, 1 mm edta, 150 mm kcl and
1.0 nm [35s]gtpgs. the gdp concentration was optimized for
each receptor system and was 30 mm for cho/kop and cho/
dop, 10 mm for cho/mop and 50 mm for rat brain membranes. membranes (2–4 mg of protein) were pre-incubated
for 20 min at 30°c with the test compounds. for each compound, control samples received an equal volume (10 ml) of
vehicle. the reaction was started by the addition of [35s]gtpgs
and continued for 40 min at 30°c. the incubation was terminated by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing
10 mm hepes/naoh (ph 7.4) and 1.0 mm mgcl2, immediately followed by rapid filtration on glass fibre filters
(whatman gf/c). the filters were washed twice with 5 ml of
buffer, and the radioactivity trapped was determined by
liquid scintillation spectrometry. non-specific binding was
determined in the presence of 50 mm gtpgs. assays were
performed in duplicate.

receptor binding assays
in cho cell membranes, receptor binding assays were carried
out by using [3h] xxxd1913xxx  to label k- and m-opioid
receptors and [3h]naltrindole (nti) to label d-opioid receptors

bjp

and by incubating the membrane preparations (15–40 mg of
protein) at 30°c for 120 min in a buffer containing 25 mm
hepes/naoh (ph 7.4), 10 mm mgcl2, 1 mm edta and
150 mm kcl. for saturation binding assays, the concentrations of [3h] xxxd1913xxx  ranged from 40 pm to 3 nm. for
competition binding assays, the concentration of either
[3h] xxxd1913xxx  or [3h]nti was 0.20 nm. non-specific
binding was determined in the presence of 10 mm naloxone
and corresponded to 4–12% and 12–30% of total [3h] xxxd1913xxx  and [3h]nti binding respectively. triplicate
determinations were made for each experiment.
[3h]u-69 593 binding was performed in membranes prepared from rat brain tissue containing both dorsal striatum
and nucleus accumbens. tissue samples were homogenized
in 50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.4) containing 0.1 mm pmsf, centrifuged at 27 000¥ g for 20 min at 4°c and frozen at -80°c.
thereafter, the tissue preparation was thawed and diluted
in 50 mm tris/hcl (ph 7.4), centrifuged as above and
re-suspended in the same buffer. aliquots containing ~300 mg
of protein were incubated with 4 nm [3h]u-69 593 at 25°c for
1 h in the presence of the indicated concentrations of  xxxd2637xxx . non-specific binding was determined in the presence of
10 mm naloxone and corresponded to 25% of total radioligand binding. saturation binding assays were performed using
3
h]u-69 593 concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 25 nm. the
estimated kd of [3h]u-69 593 was 1.2 nm. triplicate determinations were made for each experiment.
reactions were terminated by filtration through
whatman gf/c filters pre-soaked with 0.1% polyethylenimine, which were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold
buffer containing 10 mm hepes/naoh (ph 7.4) and 1 mm
mgcl2. the radioactivity trapped was determined by liquid
scintillation spectrometry.

western blot analysis
aliquots of cell extracts containing equal amount of protein
were subjected to sds-page, and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to pvdf membranes (hybond-p,
amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj, usa). non-specific
binding sites were blocked by incubation in 20 mm tris–hcl,
137 mm nacl and 0.1% tween-20 (ph 7.6) (tbs-t buffer)
containing 5% bsa for 1 h. after washing with tbs-t buffer,
the membranes were incubated overnight at 4°c with one of
the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antiphospho- xxxg1369xxx  (thr202/tyr204)/ xxxg1366xxx  (thr185/tyr187) (perk1/2)
(1:20 000) (neuromics, northfield, mn); rabbit polyclonal
anti- xxxg1369xxx /2 (1:2000), anti-phospho-creb (ser133) (1:1000),
anti-phospho-p38 mapk (thr180/tyr182) (1:1000), mouse
monoclonal anti-p38 mapk (1:1000) and rabbit monoclonal
anti-creb (1:1000) (cell signaling technology, danvers, ma,
usa). the membranes were then incubated with a hrpconjugated secondary antibody (1:10 000), and immunoreactive bands were detected by using ecl plus and ecl
hyperfilm (amersham). the size of the immunoreactive
bands was determined by using molecular weight standards
detected with a specific antibody suitable for the ecl system
(santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa). membranes were stripped of antibodies with western-reprobe
reagent (calbiochem, la jolla, ca, usa) and re-probed with
rabbit polyclonal anti-actin (1:3000) (sigma aldrich) to
control for sample loading. band densities were determined

by densitometric analysis using image scanner iii (ge healthcare, milan, italy) and nih imagej software (us national
institutes of health, bethesda, ma, usa). the optical density
of phosphoprotein bands was normalized to the density of
the corresponding total protein to yield the relative optical
density value.

statistical analysis

results are reported as mean ⫾ sem. data from
concentration–response curves were analysed by the program
graph pad prism (san diego, ca, usa), which yielded agonist
concentration producing half-maximal effect (ec50 values)
and maximal effects (emax). saturation binding data were analysed by the non-linear curve fitting program ligand, which
provided ligand dissociation constant (kd) and maximal
binding capacity (bmax). antagonist potencies were analysed
by nonlinear regression analysis. when increasing concentrations of antagonists in the presence of a fixed concentration
of agonist were examined, the antagonist inhibitory constant
(ki) was calculated according to the equation: ki = ic50/1 + (a/
ec50), where ic50 is the antagonist concentration producing
half-maximal inhibition, a is the agonist concentration and
ec50 is the agonist ec50 value. the pa2 of  xxxd2637xxx  was
calculated from schild plots, where the ratios -1 (dr-1) of the
ec50 values of the agonist in the absence and in the presence
of  xxxd2637xxx  was plotted as a function of the  xxxd2637xxx 
concentration. when the effect of a fixed  xxxd2637xxx  concentration in the presence of increasing agonist concentrations
was examined, the ki value was calculated according to the
equation: ec50b = ec50a (1 + i/ki), where ec50a and ec50b are
agonist ec50a values in the absence and in the presence of
 xxxd2637xxx , respectively; and i is the concentration of  xxxd2637xxx . statistical analysis was performed by either student’s
t-test when comparing two groups or one-way anova followed by newman–keuls post hoc tests when comparing more
than two groups.

prenorphine specifically bound to k- and m-opioid receptors
and [3h]nti bound to d-opioid receptors (figure 1a). estimation of the corresponding ki values indicated that  xxxd2637xxx 
was about 12- and 18-fold more potent in displacing the
radioligand bound to the k-opioid receptor (ki = 1.7 ⫾
0.3 mm) than the m-opioid receptor-1 (ki = 21 ⫾ 1.2 mm) and
d-opioid receptors (ki = 30.2 ⫾ 1.9 mm). in cho/kop cell
membranes, scatchard analysis of saturation binding data
indicated that  xxxd2637xxx  (10 mm) increased the kd value of
[3h] xxxd1913xxx  from 160 ⫾ 20 to 870 ⫾ 50 pm (p < 0.05,

 xxxd2637xxx  agonism at k-opioid receptors

stimulation of [35s]gtpgs binding in cho
cells transfected with human opioid receptors
in functional assays,  xxxd2637xxx  stimulated [35s]gtpgs
binding to cho/kop membranes in a concentrationdependent manner (figure 2a). the estimated ec50 value
was 0.53 ⫾ 0.05 mm (n = 3), whereas the emax value corresponded to 2.5-fold increase of control activity (p < 0.001,
n = 4). no significant stimulatory effects were observed in
either cho/mop and cho/dop cells or in untransfected
cho/k1 cells. to gain information on the relative intrinsic
activity, the stimulatory effect of  xxxd2637xxx  on [35s]gtpgs
binding was compared with that of the full k-opioid receptor agonist (–)-u-50 488. in these experiments, the effect

of mirtazapine was also investigated. in agreement with
previous data (onali et al., 2010), (–)-u-50 488 potently
stimulated [35s]gtpgs binding with an ec50 value of
0.66 ⫾ 0.04 nm (n = 5) and an emax value (2.3-fold increase
of control value, n = 5), which was similar to that of  xxxd2637xxx  (figure 2b). mirtazapine was effective in stimulating
[35s]gtpgs binding almost as much as  xxxd2637xxx , but with a
lower potency (ec50 = 7.2 ⫾ 0.8 mm, n = 3). the stimulatory
effects of both  xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine were effectively
blocked by the selective k-opioid receptor antagonist
nor-bni (100 nm) (figure 2c). the nor-bni antagonism
of  xxxd2637xxx  (30 mm)-stimulated [35s]gtpgs binding was
concentration-dependent with an estimated ki value of
39 ⫾ 5 pm (figure 2d).

stimulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in
cho/kop and c6 glioma cells
in a variety of cell types,  xxxg1369xxx /2, which belong to the mapk
family, have been shown to be critical down-stream components of opioid receptor-mediated regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (tegeder and geisslinger, 2004).
previous studies have shown that  xxxg1369xxx /2 activity is critical
for the action of antidepressants (duman et al., 2007). as
shown in figure 3a, exposure of cho/kop cells to  xxxd2637xxx 
(1 mm) induced a rapid increase in dual  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, which peaked  xxxd1891xxx  min and then declined, although
remaining above control up to 120 min. the stimulation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation by  xxxd2637xxx  was concentrationdependent with an ec50 value of 1.5 ⫾ 0.3 mm and emax corresponding to about 10-fold increase of control value
(p < 0.001, n = 5) (figure 3b). for comparison, the effect of
the naturally occurring k-opioid agonist dynorphin a 1–13
(dyn a) was examined. dyn a stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation by about 15-fold with an ec50 value of 20 ⫾ 3 pm
(p < 0.001, n = 3) (figure 3c). the stimulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation elicited by  xxxd2637xxx  (1 mm) was significantly attenuated by nor-bni (100 nm), which per se had no
effect (figure 3d). mirtazapine (3 mm) also significantly
increased phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels, and the effect was effectively antagonized by nor-bni (figure 3d).
c6 glioma cells are known to endogenously express
k-opioid receptors coupled to stimulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation (bohn et al., 2000), and we have previously
reported that, in these cells, tcas activate  xxxg1369xxx /2 through a
mechanism that involves k-opioid receptors (onali et al.,
2010). as shown in figure 4a, in c6 glioma cells  xxxd2637xxx 
induced a concentration-dependent stimulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation with an ec50 value of 1.6 ⫾ 0.3 mm and emax
corresponding to fivefold increase of control value (p < 0.001,
n = 4). the stimulatory effects elicited by low concentrations
of  xxxd2637xxx  (0.3 and 0.5 mm) were completely blocked by
nor-bni (100 nm) (figure 4b). like  xxxd2637xxx , mirtazapine
(3 mm) stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, and this effect
was suppressed by nor-bni (figure 4c). moreover, the stimulatory effects of both  xxxd2637xxx  (10 mm) and mirtazapine
(10 mm) were completely prevented in cells pre-treated with
ptx, which uncouples the g-proteins of the gi and go family
from the receptors (figure 4d).

stimulation of creb phosphorylation

figure 3

creb is a well-characterized stimulus-dependent transcription factor that is activated by phosphorylation on ser133 by
camp-dependent protein kinase and other protein kinases
pathways, including that involving  xxxg1369xxx /2 (lonze and ginty,
2002). creb up-regulation has been observed following antidepressant treatment in animals and humans and changes in
creb expression and/or activity has been associated with
antidepressant-like behaviours (blendy, 2006). in cho/kop
cells,  xxxd2637xxx  (1 mm) induced a time-dependent increase of
phospho-creb, which reached a peak at 30 min (about
twofold increase of control levels) and then slowly declined
returning at control levels at 120 min (figure 5a).  xxxd2637xxx 
significantly increased phospho-creb also in c6 cells, and
in either these cells or cho/kop cells, the stimulatory effect
was blocked by nor-bni (100 nm) (figure 5b and c). like

selective activation of k-opioid receptors in rat
striatum and nucleus accumbens
to investigate whether  xxxd2637xxx  acted on k-opioid receptors
expressed in the brain, radioligand binding studies using the
selective k-opioid receptor ligand [3h]u-69 593 were first conducted in membranes derived from rat dorsal and ventral
striatum.  xxxd2637xxx  completely displaced [3h]u-69 593
specific binding with a ki value of 1.7 ⫾ 0.3 mm (n = 3)
(figure 6a). in membranes of individually dissected rat
striatum and nucleus accumbens,  xxxd2637xxx  elicited a
concentration-dependent stimulation of [35s]gtpgs binding
with ec50 values of 0.70 ⫾ 0.05 and 0.39 ⫾ 0.06 mm, respectively, and emax values corresponding to 13 ⫾ 2% (p < 0.05,
n = 5) and 22 ⫾ 3% increase of control activity (p < 0.05,
n = 4) respectively (figure 6b). in the same membrane preparations, (–)-u-50 488 increased [35s]gtpgs binding by
20 ⫾ 2% (p < 0.05, n = 4) and 29 ⫾ 3%, respectively (p < 0.05,

n = 4), with ec50 of 7.4 ⫾ 0.5 and 4.0 ⫾ 0.3 nm respectively
(figure 6b). in nucleus accumbens, the stimulation of
[35s]gtpgs binding by  xxxd2637xxx  (30 mm) was completely
blocked by nor-bni (1 nm) but was not affected by either the
selective m-opioid receptor antagonist ctap (10 nm) or the
selective d-opioid antagonist nti (1nm) (figure 6c).

effects of  xxxd2637xxx  in combination with
opioid receptor agonists
in rat striatal membranes, the curve of [35s]gtpgs binding
stimulation by dynorphin a (ec50 = 3.9 ⫾ 0.5 nm) was progressively shifted to the right in the presence of increasing
concentrations of  xxxd2637xxx  (figure 7a). schild analysis of
 xxxd2637xxx  antagonism yielded a pa2 value of 5.9 ⫾ 0.2
(n = 4). similarly,  xxxd2637xxx  (10 mm) caused a rightward shift
in (–)-u-50 488 concentration–response curve with an estimated ki of 1.5 ⫾ 0.2 mm (n = 4) (figure 7b). conversely,
 xxxd2637xxx  (10 mm) failed to affect the stimulation of
[35s]gtpgs binding elicited by either the selective d-opioid
receptor agonist dpdpe (figure 7c) or the selective m-opioid
receptor agonist damgo (figure 7d).

exposure to dynorphin a (30 nm) increased p38 mapk
phosphorylation by about twofold (p < 0.05, n = 4)
(figure 8a). addition of  xxxd2637xxx  (10 mm) caused a modest
increase of p38 phosphorylation and, when combined with
dynorphin a, inhibited the stimulatory effect of the full
k-opioid agonist (figure 8a). in primary cultures of mouse
hippocampal neurons, dynorphin a (30 nm) increased
phospho-p38 mapk levels by about threefold (p < 0.001,
n = 4) (figure 8b), and this response was antagonized in the
presence of  xxxd2637xxx  (10 mm), which per se caused only a
small stimulatory effect (figure 8b).
we next examined the effect of  xxxd2637xxx  on k-opioid
receptor-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in primary cultures of striatal neurons. in these cells, dyn a (30 nm)
increased phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 by 3.5-fold (p < 0.001, n = 4). as
observed for p38 mapk responses,  xxxd2637xxx  (10 mm)
induced a slight increase in phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels (35 ⫾ 8%,
p < 0.05, n = 4) but significantly attenuated the stimulatory
effect of dynorphin a (figure 8c).

discussion
in the present study, we report for the first time that the
tetracyclic atypical antidepressant  xxxd2637xxx  behaves as an
agonist at both recombinant and native k-opioid receptors.
the k-opioid selectivity of  xxxd2637xxx  was first documented by
studies conducted in cho cells stably expressing the different
opioid receptor subtypes. thus, in radioligand competition
experiments,  xxxd2637xxx  affinity for k-opioid receptors was 18and 12-fold higher than that for d- and m-opioid receptors
respectively. as expected for a competitive type of ligand–
receptor interaction, scatchard analysis of [3h] xxxd1913xxx 
binding to k-opioid receptors showed that  xxxd2637xxx 
decreased the affinity of the radioligand without significantly
affecting the bmax value. functional studies using the stimulation of gtpgs binding in cell membranes as readout showed
that the antidepressant selectively activated the k-opioid
receptors, being without significant effect at m- and d-opioid
receptors. the  xxxd2637xxx  agonist activity was blocked by

nor-bni with a potency (ki = 39 pm) consistent with the
antagonist affinity for the k-opioid receptor (metcalf and
coop, 2005). moreover, in cho/kop cells and c6 glioma
cells, nor-bni effectively antagonized the  xxxd2637xxx -induced
1338

british journal of pharmacology (2012) 167 1329–1341

stimulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and creb phosphorylation, indicating
the involvement of k-opioid receptors also in functional
responses measured in intact cell preparations. interestingly,
mirtazapine, which is close to  xxxd2637xxx  both structurally
and pharmacologically (croom et al., 2009), was found to
behave similarly to  xxxd2637xxx , being able to elicit nor-bnisensitive responses in both cho/kop cells and c6 glioma
cells. thus, the agonist activity at k-opioid receptors
appears to be an additional property shared by the two
antidepressants.
the ability of  xxxd2637xxx  to selectively interact with
k-opioid receptors was also observed in rat striatum and
nucleus accumbens, two brain areas known to express all
three opioid receptor subtypes (mansour et al., 1995). in rat
striatum,  xxxd2637xxx  displaced the binding of the selective
k-agonist [3h]u-69 593 with an affinity similar to that displayed in cho/kop cells.  xxxd2637xxx  has previously been
reported to antagonize opiate binding in extracts of whole rat
brain, although with a potency (ic50 = 88 mm) much lower
than that observed in the present study (isenberg and cicero,
1984). the reason for this discrepancy may be due to the fact
that in the latter study the non-selective radioligand [3h]naltrexone was employed. the lower  xxxd2637xxx  affinity could
therefore have been due to [3h]naltrexone binding to the
highly abundant m- and d-opioid receptors, for which  xxxd2637xxx  displays low affinity.
 xxxd2637xxx  was found to be more effective in stimulating
gtpgs binding in nucleus accumbens than striatum, consistent with the higher density of k-opioid receptors in ventral
than in dorsal, striatum (mansour et al., 1995). however, in
contrast to the responses observed in cho cells overexpressing the k-opioid receptor, where  xxxd2637xxx  was as effective as
(–)-u-50 488, the maximal stimulation by  xxxd2637xxx  of gtpgs
binding in the brain areas was lower than that elicited by full
k-agonists. when combined with either dynorphin a or (–)u-50 488,  xxxd2637xxx  antagonized the stimulation of gtpgs
binding elicited by the highly efficacious k-agonists with a
potency equal to its affinity for k-opioid receptors. moreover,
in primary cultures of mouse striatal and hippocampal
neurons,  xxxd2637xxx  weakly enhanced the phosphorylation of
p38 mapk but effectively antagonized the stimulation elicited by dynorphin a. similar results were obtained by examining dynorphin a-induced stimulation of phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2
in striatal neurons. these data indicate that at brain k-opioid
receptors,  xxxd2637xxx  behaves as a partial agonist. in this
respect, its activity is similar to that of tcas, which have also
been found to act as partial k-agonists in the brain (onali
et al., 2010).
a critical issue concerning the k-opioid agonist activity of
 xxxd2637xxx  is whether the observed receptor affinity is comparable with the tissue concentrations reached by the drug
following therapeutic doses. in patients with depression,
therapeutic  xxxd2637xxx  plasma concentrations have been
reported to range from 0.1 to 0.3 mm (otani et al., 1993). in
mice, either acute or chronic administration of  xxxd2637xxx 
yielded brain concentrations that were at least 10-fold higher
than the plasma concentrations (altamura et al., 1987). in
rats, a chronic continuous infusion of  xxxd2637xxx  produced
serum concentrations of 118 ng· xxxg1167xxx , a value close to the
therapeutic plasma concentrations, and whole brain concentrations of 1520 ng·g-1, with a brain/serum ratio of 13.6

 xxxd2637xxx  agonism at k-opioid receptors

(kurata and kurachi, 1989). thus, although the  xxxd2637xxx 
concentrations in the biophase are not known, the affinity of
 xxxd2637xxx  for k-opioid receptors (~1.5 mm) observed in the
present study is compatible with the concentrations that can
be reached by the drug in the brain. nonetheless, in vivo
functional studies are required to investigate whether  xxxd2637xxx  is capable of affecting brain k-opioid receptor signalling
following acute and chronic administration.
previous studies have reported that  xxxd2637xxx  binds to
5-ht2 receptors and a2-adrenoceptors with low nanomolar
affinities (peroutka and snyder, 1981; richelson and nelson,
1984), whereas we found that the drug displays an affinity for
k-opioid receptors in the low micromolar range. this difference suggests that the activity of  xxxd2637xxx  would be much
more potent at receptor sites other than k-opioid receptors.
however, in different studies using either brain synaptosomes
or tissue slices, micromolar concentrations of  xxxd2637xxx  were
used to increase noradrenaline release via blockade of presynaptic a2-adrenoceptors (schoemaker et al., 1981; raiteri
et al., 1983; rose et al., 1984), a major mechanism thought to
mediate the antidepressant action of the drug (marshall,
1983; pinder, 1985). similarly, electrophysiological studies in
guinea pig caecum found that  xxxd2637xxx  blocked presynaptic and post-synaptic a2-adrenoceptors with micromolar potencies (tokimasa et al., 1987). on the other hand, in
rat vas deferens,  xxxd2637xxx  was reported to competitively
antagonize the pre-synaptic action of the a2-adrenoceptor
agonist clonidine with a pa2 value of 7.3 (doxey et al., 1978).
thus, it appears that, at least in some functional assays,
 xxxd2637xxx  acted as a2-adrenoceptor antagonist at concentrations comparable with those required for activating k-opioid
receptors.
the relevance of the k-opioid agonist activity for the
pharmacological actions of  xxxd2637xxx  remains to be determined. nonetheless, some potential implications can be considered. behavioural studies in mice have reported that
 xxxd2637xxx  produced analgesic effects in the hotplate test, and
this effect was blocked not only by naloxone but also norbni and b-funaltrexamine, a m-opioid antagonist, but not
nti (schreiber et al., 1998). the anti-nociception induced by
mirtazapine in mice was also reported to be prevented by
nor-bni (schreiber et al., 2002). in addition to d-opioid receptors, k-opioid receptors have been found to be involved in
the attenuation of neuropathic allodynia by chronic tca
treatment in mice (benbouzid et al., 2008a). the precise
mechanisms underlying the participation of the endogenous
opioid system in the analgesic actions of  xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine have not been elucidated. for antidepressants in
general, indirect effects on the opioid system mediated by
monoamine transmission have been hypothesized (mico
et al., 2006). however, as suggested by the present data, it is
possible that, in addition to these mechanisms, a direct
agonist activity at k-opioid receptors may contribute to the
analgesic effects of  xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine. it is important to mention that  xxxd2637xxx  has been reported to either
antagonize or potentiate the analgesic effect of u-50 488 (ho
and takemori, 1989; schreiber et al., 1998). the antagonist
effects of  xxxd2637xxx  have been attributed to blockade of 5-ht
neurotransmission (ho and takemori, 1989), which has been
shown to be required for opioid-induced analgesia (zhao
et al., 2007). on the other hand, the mechanisms underlying

bjp

the potentiating effect of  xxxd2637xxx  on u-50 488-induced
analgesia have not been elucidated. the present data
showing that  xxxd2637xxx  antagonized u-50 488 indicated that
a synergistic interaction at the k-opioid receptor is unlikely
to be involved.
besides controlling pain, k-opioid receptors have been
shown to modulate mood and anxiety, although with controversial results. in rats, the administration of low doses of
k-opioid receptor agonists was found to produce anxiolyticlike effects in the elevated plus-maze test (privette and
terrian, 1995). an anxiolytic-like behaviour was also
observed following u-69 593 in the infralimbic cortex of
mice (wall and messier, 2000). in mice, the modulation of
anxiety-related behaviour by k-opioid receptors was found
to be dependent on social status, as u-50 488 had no effect
on winners but had anxiolytic-like effects in repeatedly
defeated subjects (kudryavtseva et al., 2004). on the other
hand, a large body of evidence indicates that k-opioid
receptor activation produces depressive-like behaviour and
anxiety. thus, the administration of k-opioid agonists has
been reported to induce dysphoric and psychotomimetic
effect in humans (pfeiffer et al., 1986) and pro-depressivelike and anxiogenic effects in rodents (bals-kubik et al.,
1993; narita et al., 2006). moreover, several studies have
shown that blockade of central k-opioid receptors has anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects (mague et al., 2003;
bruijnzeel, 2009; carlezon et al., 2009). similarly,  xxxg1722xxx  gene disruption produced less anxiety and prodepressive signs in mice with c57bl/6n genetic background
(mclaughlin et al., 2003; wittmann et al., 2009) but an
increase in anxiety in mice with c57bl/6j background
(bilkei-gorzo et al., 2008). mice lacking the k-opioid receptor gene exhibited either no change in anxiety-like behaviour (filliol et al., 2000) or increased depressive-like
behaviour (mclaughlin et al., 2003) likely depending on the
test conditions. recently, it has been shown that behavioural stressors can lead to activation of the endogenous
k-opioid system (land et al., 2008), and that dynorphinstimulated p-38 mapk signalling plays a critical role in
stress-induced impairment of 5-ht transmission and dysphoria (bruchas et al., 2007; 2011). thus, the majority of
the studies using either pharmacological or genetic
approaches indicate that an increased activity of the
k-opioid receptor system mediates pro-depressive and anxiogenic effects. therefore, the finding that  xxxd2637xxx  activates k-opioid receptors seems to oppose the possibility that
this action may participate in the therapeutic effects of the
drug. on the other hand, it should be considered that
 xxxd2637xxx  acts as a partial agonist at brain k-opioid receptors, causing an attenuation of receptor stimulation by
highly efficacious agonists. thus, it is possible that  xxxd2637xxx  may inhibit the increased k-opioid receptor activation
elicited by endogenous agonists released under stress conditions. this hypothesis remains to be verified in vivo by
conducting specific behavioural tests.
in conclusion, the present study shows that the atypical
antidepressant  xxxd2637xxx  exerts direct agonist activity at
k-opioid receptors. as tcas have previously been found to
behave similarly, the study supports the idea that this opioid
receptor agonism may be a common property of different
classes of antidepressant drugs.
