the relative merits and drawbacks of new nucleoside analogues with clinical
potential

department of antiviral chemotherapy research and development laboratories,
astra ldkemedel ab, 151 85 sodertdlje, sweden
a large number of nucleoside analogues have been found to have antiviral
activity, mainly against herpesviruses. the involvement of cellular as well as viral
enzymes in the mode of action of several nucleoside analogues makes a prediction
of clinical efficacy difficult. the possibility and consequences of incorporation
into cellular dna are other important aspects of nucleoside analogues as antiviral
drugs. it seems likely that in the next few years enough knowledge about mechanism of action, consequences of incorporation into dna, efficacy in different test
systems and in clinical trials will accumulate to allow an understanding of how
to design even better antiviral drugs.

introduction

in recent years a large number of nucleoside analogues have been described as antiviral agents. most of these compounds have been active against herpesviruses, partly
because herpesviruses have been the main targets for efforts to find antiviral drugs.
it has become increasingly clear that the relative cell culture efficacy of nucleoside
analogues against herpesviruses does not reflect the efficacy in infected animals. it
is not yet possible to predict clinical efficacy from cell culture data nor is the
extent and consequences known of incorporation of nucleoside analogues into
cellular dna. despite this ignorance it might be worthwhile discussing some of the
advantages and disadvantages with nucleoside analogues as antiviral drugs.
viral enzymes involved in nucleic acid synthesis

one reason why nucleoside analogues have been the most common structural type
of antiviral compounds is that most viruses use rna or dna polymerases coded
for by the viral genome and different from cellular polymerases (helgstrand & oberg,
1980). table i shows that the only viruses not having dna or rna polymerases
are parvo and papova viruses. several other enzymes involved in the synthesis of
viral nucleic acids are also coded for by the viral genome as indicated in table ii
for herpes, influenza and rhino viruses. the herpesvirus thymidine kinase (tk) is
a key enzyme for many nucleoside analogues. it is induced by herpes simplex virus
type 1 (hsv-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2) and varicella-zoster virus
(vzv) but not by epstein-barr virus (ebv) or cytomegalovirus (cmv).

this is not a complete review of nucleoside analogues with antiviral activity but
rather a discussion of the few selected compounds shown in table iii. one of these
compounds, ribavirin, has been used against rna viruses and the other compounds
against dna viruses, mainly herpes viruses.

the viral enzymes can be utilized as targets for antiviral agents in two different ways,
sometimes combined consecutively, as shown in figure 1. a nucleoside analogue,
or any other type of inhibitor, could either selectively inhibit a necessary viral function at concentrations not affecting cellular enzymes, or it could be transformed by
a viral enzyme into an active inhibitor. if the activation of the compound is a very
selective process carried out almost exclusively by a viral enzyme, then the activated
compound does not have to be very selective in its further activity. it could block
both viral and cellular functions if it is formed only in the infected cell. however,
in most cases enzymic reactions are not that selective and it is an advantage if the
activated inhibitor also has a selective action against a viral function. the nucleoside
analogues we will discuss all have to be activated in several steps by both viral and
cellular enzymes and they also interact with viral polymerases.
a general property of viral enzymes involved in nucleic acid synthesis is that the
structural requirement, as regards substrates, is less strict than the structural requirements of the corresponding cellular enzymes. this is of importance since most
nucleoside analogues active as antiviral drugs are substrate analogues.

rna polymerase. as shown in figure 5 ribavirin monophosphate will block inosine
monophosphate (imp) dehydrogenase and thus deplete the gtp pool and possibly
also interact with the formation of cap structures on cellular mrna (goswami et
al, 1979). functional cap structures from cellular mrna are required as primers
for influenza mrna synthesis. these reactions seem to be competitive but it is not
clear if the concentration of the competing substrates are sufficient and variable
enough to influence in in vivo effect of ribavirin. a suppression of dttp formation
is also observed in cells (drach et al, 1981).
in mice, ribavirin given orally has a good therapeutic activity against influenza
but, clinically, oral ribavirin has not been effective against influenza. however, ribavirin given as an aerosol is active clinically against influenza a infections as shown
in table iv. in contrast to amantadine and rimantadine, ribavirin is also active
against influenza b infections and aerosol treatment has shown therapeutic effects
as indicated in table v and figure 6. interestingly ribavirin has also shown (figure
7) therapeutic effects against respiratory syncytial virus infections in children. apart
from lung function improvement there was also a decrease in virus shedding. since
ribavirin is a  xxxd2246xxx  analogue the risk for mutagenic effects due to incorporation into dna ought to be small as long as the modified base is not transferred

figure 8 shows the structure of ara-a. it has an adenine base attached to an arabinose
sugar. although ara-a has been studied for a rather long time its mechanism of action
is still unclear. it is possible that several modes of action are involved and some are
indicated in figure 9. ara-a is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes and is incorporated in both cellular and herpesvirus dna (pelling, drach & shipman, 1981). there
is some specificity since the triphosphate is a better inhibitor of herpesvirus dna
polymerase than of cellular dna polymerase (miiller, zahn & falke, 1978, drach
& shipman, 1977). the importance of normal substrates participating in the competitive reactions leading to an incorporation of ara-amp into dna is not clear,
nor are the consequences of incorporation into cellular dna. the therapeutic
effects of ara-a and its more soluble monophosphate have been discussed elsewhere
(whitley, this volume) and will not be repeated. in contrast to its low activity against
herpesviruses in cell culture, ara-a is surprisingly active both against herpes keratitis

the halogenated nucleoside analogues bvdu and fiac (figure 13) have very high
antiviral activity in cell cultures and are much more selective in their action than
idu and tft but their mechanism of action is also based on a structural similarity
to thymidine and  xxxd1836xxx . bvdu and similar structures have been discussed

a possible mechanism of action is shown in figure 14. both compounds have a high
selectivity in the first step and are phosphorylated by hsv and vzv tk much more
effectively than by cellular kinases. the details of the further phosphorylation to triphosphates are less well known but all steps are probably competitive reactions. both
bvdu and fiac show a selective inhibition of hsv dna synthesis as compared
to cellular dna synthesis (larsson & oberg, 1981). however, both bvdu-mp and
fiac-mp, and its metabolite fmau-mp (fmau = 2'-fluoro-5-methyl-arabinofuranosyluracil) are incorporated into dna which can be observed for bvdu as
a shift in density of the viral dna band in cscl gradients (larsson & oberg, 1982),
shown in figure 15, and in the ability of fiac-tp to support cell-free herpesvirus
dna synthesis in the absence of dctp (ruth & cheng, 1981; allauden et al., 1982).
fiac seems to be extensively metabolized to fmau before incorporation into

in figure 12 they are further phosphorylated, probably by cellular enzymes, to triphosphates. idu is also transformed to  xxxd540xxx  by  xxxg2365xxx 
and tft-mp inhibits  xxxg2366xxx  resulting in a decreased pool of tmp
and thus less competition during phosphorylation of tft-mp. the incorporation
of idu and tft monophosphates into viral and cellular dna is at least partly the
basis for their antiherpes activity. since there is little specificity in this incorporation,
these antiviral drugs can only be used where cellular dna synthesis is minimal. the
presence of nucleoside analogues in dna will result in effects on transcription and
translation (otto, lee & prusoff, 1982). the hsv and vzv infected cells will contain
more tk than uninfected cells and contribute to some selectivity and this might be
one reason why tk-hsv is somewhat resistant to idu. the incorporation of idu
and tft monophosphates into dna in uninfected cells is extensive and the restriction of the compound to topical use against herpes keratitis seem sensible. furthermore at therapeutic concentrations, tft, but not idu, causes sister chromatid
exchange in human cells (cassiman et al., 1981). idu and tft have been reviewed
by prusoff et al. (1979) and heidelberger & king (1979).

dna. incorporation of metabolized fiac has also been shown to occur into the
dna of the small intestine in uninfected mice (grant et al., 1982). since bvdu
and fiac, at least to a low extent, are likely to be phosphorylated even in uninfected
cells and probably also be incorporated into cellular dna, the biological consequences of this possibility should be considered. the modes of action of bvdu and
fiac as antiherpes agents are not quite clear but inhibition of viral dna polymerase as well as incorporation into viral dna resulting in defective mrna and thus
non functional proteins are probably of importance. the extent of incorporation of
bvdu-mp into hsv dna correlates to the antiviral activity and the incorporation
also results in a labile dna as revealed by an increased number of single strand
breaks observed in alkaline sucrose gradients (manchini et al., 1983). the implication of a competitive mode of action in the different phosphorylation steps will
be discussed later. the antiviral activity of bvdu has been reviewed by de clercq
(1983) and that of fiac by fox et al. (1982).

derivatives by keller et al. (1981). the likely modes of action of acv, dhbg and
 xxxd2178xxx  are illustrated in figure 17. the mechanism of action of acv is best known
and is shown in more detail in figure 18. in the first phosphorylation there is a
competition with thymidine and later with dgmp (miller & miller, 1980), possibly
dgdp (miller & miller, 1982) and in the last step with  xxxd1837xxx . acv-tp is both
an inhibitor and an alternative substrate for the viral dna polymerase (furman et
al., 1979). since acv has only one hydroxyl group available for phosphodiester
bond formation it will terminate a dna chain.  xxxd2178xxx  contains two hydroxyl groups
and can be incorporated in such a manner as to allow elongation. moreover, incorporation into dna has been reported (cheng et al., 1983). it is presently unclear
if dhbg, which also contains two hydroxyl groups, is incorporated into dna. the
non-competitive inhibition of herpesvirus dna polymerase by terminally incorporated acv (figure 18) is interesting and could mean that the nucleoside analogue

18

b. oberg and n.-g. johansson

could not be removed by the nuclease activity associated to herpesvirus dna
polymerase (derse et ai, 1981).
the selectivity of acv against viral dna synthesis is easily seen when dna from
hsv infected and acv treated cells is banded in cscl gradients as shown in figure
19, and acv is a more selective inhibitor of viral dna synthesis than fiac or
bvdu.

comparisons
when the antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue is tested against one strain of
herpesvirus but in different cell cultures (figure 20) a 50% inhibition of hsv-1
plaque formation is noted at concentrations widely different for different cells
(harmenberg, wahren & oberg, 1980). this type of variation can also be seen for
other nucleoside analogues requiring hsv tk for phosphorylation. at least part of
the explanation for these differences is the thymidine content of the cells. the cells
where acv has the best antiviral activity against hsv have the lowest thymidine
content (harmenberg, 1983). there are also differences in kinase activity
(harmenberg, kallander & gronowitz, 1984) but the thymidine effect is probably
of more importance.

reversal of the inhibition due to nucleoside analogues can, in cell culture, be
achieved by addition of thymidine (larsson, brannstrom & oberg, 19836). this is
shown in table vii for a few compounds. it is evident that the sensitivity to reversal
differs between different nucleoside analogues in a manner reflecting their affinity
to hsv tk. the kinetics of this reversal can be determined in cell culture analogous
to enzyme kinetic studies and figure 21 shows the reversal kinetics for acv, dhbg

and bvdu. dhbg has 100 times higher affinity than acv to the viral tk and
its effect is less easily reversed by thymidine. since the thymidine content in skin
is rather high, reaching 10 to 20 um in guinea pigs, (harmenberg, 1983), this would
influence the therapeutic effect in vivo. the effective reversal of the inhibition by
bvdu, which has a high affinity for the viral tk, is probably also due to increased
concentrations of the tdp and ttp, which are competitive substrates. even if the
thymidine content of cells influences the antiherpes activity of some nucleoside
analogues this is certainly not the only factor determining the therapeutic effect. a
comparison of the phosphorylation of acv and  xxxd2178xxx  in primary rabbit kidney
cells reveals (table viii) that the phosphorylation to mono-, di- and triphosphate
is more efficient for  xxxd2178xxx  than for acv (germershausen et al., 1983). however,
the differences are not as large as expected from experiments using purified herpesvirus tk and hog brain  xxxg1005xxx  studying the two first steps of phosphorylation
(ashton^a/., 1982).
table ix illustrates the relative efficacy, on a molar basis and using the best
possible vehicles, of a few compounds tested in different animal models of hsv-1
infections. it is evident, as also reported previously (alenius & oberg, 1978; alenius
et al., 1982), that the cell culture efficacy cannot be used to predict the relative therapeutic effect in animals, even when the same strain of hsv is used. this is perhaps
not surprising since the drugs in different animal species could be expected to differ

as regards uptake, degradation and distribution to the infected tissue. the comparative effects of  xxxd2178xxx  have not yet been reported in identical models but published
results show a high activity when given orally to mice with mucocutaneous or systemic hsv infections (field et ai, 1983). since the activation and metabolism of
nucleoside analogues involves several cellular enzymes, which might differ between
mice and man, a determination of id50 in cell culture and the actual concentration
of the drug and competing substrates in the infected tissue might possibly be used
to predict efficacy in man.

only one type of viral infection in humans, herpes keratitis, has been the target
of studies comparing the efficacy of several nucleoside analogues and figures 22 to

was reported earlier to give a therapeutic effect against herpes keratitis. in rabbits
with a primary herpes keratitis, idu has an excellent therapeutic effect but in recurrent clinical cases the effect is not very impressive and in one well-controlled study

antiviral nucleoside analogues

23

general aspects of nucleoside analogues
table x lists a few of the many important aspects on nucleoside analogues one has
to consider in selecting them as antiviral drugs. only those properties that are
directly connected to this type of chemical structure are listed. properties such as
general toxicology, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics are not considered as they
are of general importance and not specifically connected to nucleoside analogues.
furthermore, exact information in these areas is often absent in the literature.
the first point in table x is of course trivial but none the less important because
the more specificity the less problems with, for example, incorporation into cellular
dna in uninfected cells. however, it would be naive to think of any inhibitor as
absolutely specific and one has to consider the effects of incorporation of nucleoside
analogues into cellular dna in the non-infected cell (see table viii). there is also
the possibility that nucleoside triphosphates could pass through tight junctions from
an infected to an uninfected cell. if an incorporation into dna results in the death
of the cell it is probably of no serious consequence as long as it happens only in
a few cells. if the incorporation results in a permanent localization of a nucleoside
analogue in a dna strand this might have consequences for base-pairing, methylation, recognition by enzymes, etc., all of which possibly could result in mutagenic
and carcinogenic effects.
nucleoside analogues which seem to carry less risk than others for carcinogenic
potential are those with a normal base, such as acv, dhbg and  xxxd2178xxx , and a
metabolic transfer of the base to a new sugar by nucleoside phosphorylases should
not be of any concern. a nucleoside analogue, such as acv, terminating a growing
dna chain might have less risk of causing trouble than one incorporated internally
although the terminal incorporation will lead to fragmentation of dna.
of course, all new drugs of this type are evaluated for carcinogenic effects in long
term experiments in mice and rats and also in different cell culture systems. however, these are systems with enzymes possibly differing from those of man in their
ability to recognize nucleoside and nucleotide analogues and extrapolation from
mice to man might be especially dangerous with compounds involving the action
of several cellular as well as viral enzymes. a safety evaluation should include
comparative studies in human cells and rodent cells to make a prediction for possible
carcinogenic effects in humans.
since the nucleoside analogues used as antiherpes drugs are substrate analogues

indicating clinical efficacy. debridement, steroids and other types of concurrent
treatment probably influence the result of treatment more than the actual choice
of nucleoside analogue, although these differ considerably in cell culture efficacy
against hsv. since most nucleoside analogues in controlled studies have given therapeutic effects similar to the reference compound idu there is some uncertainty as
to their true therapeutic potential, and although herpes keratitis is possibly the
herpes infection most similar to a cell culture experiment there is still no obvious
correlation between clinical benefit and cell culture efficacy.
in other herpes infections where penetration, oral uptake, metabolism and interfering nucleosides and nucleotides are even more likely to make a prediction of efficacy difficult, there are no results from controlled clinical trials comparing different
nucleoside analogues.

in several reactions of importance for the antiviral effect, the ability of the nucleoside
analogues to compete with the natural substrates, and the concentrations of these
substrates in vivo will be of importance for efficacy. this is easily forgotten and
ranking the antiviral activity of nucleoside analogues according to efficacy in a cell
culture assay could be misleading if the intention is to predict in vivo efficacy. the
in vivo efficacy of a compound is, of course, influenced by several other factors such
as degradation and pharmacokinetics.
we have just begun to realize the difficulty in predicting clinical efficacy of nucleoside analogues and possible side effects due to incorporation into dna, but the next
years will certainly provide us with a much deeper understanding of these questions
and help us to design better antiviral drugs.
