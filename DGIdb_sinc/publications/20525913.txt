here has been increasing interest in the potential benefits of  xxxd2019xxx . much of the stimulus came from
meta-analysis of  xxxd2019xxx  and calcium in osteoporotic
fracture studies as well as association studies relating increased prevalence of diseases such as cancer, diabetes,
multiple sclerosis, and cardiovascular events with lower
levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d (25ohd).
 xxxd2019xxx  from diet or sun is converted in the liver to
25ohd and then in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
d [1,25(oh)2d], the active form of  xxxd2019xxx . normally,
the main source of 1,25(oh)2d is the kidney, and serum
1,25(oh)2d is regulated by changes in serum calcium,
phosphorus, fibroblast growth factor-23, and pth; serum
levels are held constant through homeostatic regulation.
circulating 1,25(oh)2d binds to the target tissues in the
body that have a  xxxg2412xxx  where it expresses
 xxxd2019xxx -responsive genes.
in addition, many tissues (for example, breast, colon,
prostate, bone, and immune cells) express 25ohd-1-␣hydroxylase that converts 25ohd to  xxxd408xxx  locally. these local effects cause decreased proliferation of cells, increased cell differentiation, and cell
survival. the importance of the peripheral conversion of
25ohd to 1,25(oh)2d relative to systemic production is
difficult to assess, and nothing is known about the level of
serum 25ohd when peripheral conversion might be impaired.
it is difficult to define adequate  xxxd2019xxx  nutrition
because circulating  xxxd2019xxx  is derived from both dietary
sources and sunlight; however, serum 25ohd is stable
over weeks and serves as a biomarker of the adequacy of
 xxxd2019xxx  supplies. the sunlight effect depends on distance from the equator, so for example in northern countries at 40° latitude, sunlight– or rather uvb radiation–is
effective in converting  xxxd1682xxx  to vitamin
d3 in skin for about 7 months of the year and in sweden

t

at 55– 65° latitude, monthly exposure to uvb is 5 months.
the length of effective uvb exposure depends on the angle
of the sun and atmospheric pollution, and the sun needs to
be above 35° to be effective.
with the ready availability of accurate serum 25ohd
measurements, results from different countries show a lot
of variation in levels, and the discussion centers on the
significance of the values. what is a low level? in the past,
 xxxd2019xxx  deficiency was defined as serum 25ohd below
10 ng/ml because both serum 1,25(oh)2d and calcium
absorption declined significantly at this level (1, 2). the
world health organization (who) defined  xxxd2019xxx 
insufficiency as serum 25ohd below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/
liter) (3). however, others recently started to define  xxxd2019xxx  deficiency as serum 25ohd level below 20 ng/ml
and  xxxd2019xxx  insufficiency as less than 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/
liter) (4). the primary argument for this change in definition
is based on the finding that serum pth, which is inversely
related to serum 25ohd, decreases as serum 25ohd increases and reaches a plateau at a serum 25ohd of approximately 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter). this is certainly controversial because numerous studies show a large variation in the
plateau level of pth ranging from a serum 25ohd of 18
ng/ml (45 nmol/liter) (5) to 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) (6).
this change in definition of  xxxd2019xxx  insufficiency
actually has major significance because the dose of vitamin
d required to increase people to a minimum serum
25ohd of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) is approximately 800
iu daily (7), whereas increasing people to a minimum level
of 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) would require approximately
4,000 iu daily (8). unfortunately, there are no long-term
prospective studies of either the efficacy or safety of these
larger doses of  xxxd2019xxx . there are two important questions: what data support recommending a minimum serum 25ohd level of either 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) or 30

ng/ml (75 nmol/liter), and what is the adequate intake
required to achieve that level?
a paper published in the current issue of jcem by melhus et al. (9) presents data on the association between
serum 25ohd and the incidence of hip fractures and provides some insight into these questions.
melhus et al. (9) describe the results of a prospective,
population-based cohort study of 1194 elderly men (mean
age, 71 yr) with a median follow-up of 11 yr. the primary
outcome was the time to any fracture that was identified
using the national patient and county registries in sweden.
the investigators used an innovative statistical approach
to find the optimum category boundary for serum
25ohd. this approach allowed them to divide the cohort
into two groups according to serum 25ohd less than and
greater than 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter). the hazard ratio
(hr) for hip fractures in subjects with serum 25ohd
below 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) was significantly increased
at 1.71 [95% confidence limit (cl), 1.13–2.57], compared with those with serum 25ohd above 16 ng/ml (40
nmol/liter). there was a decrease in risk after adjustment
for age, weight, height,  xxxg538xxx , blood draw season, and
comorbidities to 1.58 (95% cl, 1.04 –2.41). this signifies
a significant effect of serum 25ohd below 16 ng/ml (40
nmol/liter) on hip fractures, although most of the fractures
are due to osteoporosis. although the study was done in
northern europe, the prevalence of serum 25ohd below 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) was only 5.4% in men so
that the relative risk of hip fracture was high but the
absolute risk was small. what is surprising is the unexpected low incidence of  xxxd2019xxx  insufficiency in
sweden, which is 55– 65° above the equator. some other
studies in sweden have also shown a low prevalence of
serum 25ohd below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) (10); this
may be due to fortification of food and higher vitamin
d intake. in other parts of europe, there is a higher
prevalence of serum 25ohd below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/
liter) (10), and in north america the prevalence of serum 25ohd below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) in men is
23% (11). in areas of  xxxd2019xxx  insufficiency, the absolute number of hip fractures due to  xxxd2019xxx  deficiency should be increased. the authors also analyzed
the effect of baseline serum 25ohd on bone mineral
density (bmd) and found that the subjects with serum
25ohd below 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) had spine bmd
that was 9% lower (1.2 vs. 1.32 g/cm2; p ⫽ 0.04) compared with those with higher serum 25ohd levels that
can be attributed to secondary hyperparathyroidism.
there was no difference in hip bmd.
other recent studies provide similar results. a bone
biopsy study in germany was performed in 675 autopsies
after sudden death (12). autopsies excluded secondary

jcem.endojournals.org

2631

causes of osteoporosis. they found osteomalacia in approximately 24% of cases. serum 25ohd was measured
at autopsy and then correlated with the biopsy findings.
approximately 96.5% of osteomalacia cases occurred at
a serum 25ohd level below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter), and
approximately 99% occurred at a serum 25ohd below
25 ng/ml (62.5 nmol/liter). there was no difference in the
results of men vs. women.
a nested case-control study from the women’s health
initiative (whi) observation study (mean age, 71 yr) examined hip fracture incidence over 7 yr according to quartiles of serum 25ohd and found a significant increase in
hip fractures with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.71 (95% cl,
1.05–2.79) only in the lowest quartile of serum 25ohd of
19 ng/ml (47.5 nmol/liter) or less compared with the highest quartile of at least 28.3 ng/ml (70.75 nmol/liter) (13).
in a recent case-cohort study of 436 men with incident
nonspine fractures of 1608 men with average follow-up of
5.3 yr (14), the hr for hip fracture incidence was 2.36
(95% cl, 1.08 –5.16) in the lowest quartile of total serum
25ohd below 19 ng/ml (47.5 nmol/liter) compared with
the highest quartile above 27.9 ng/ml (70 nmol/liter) after
adjustment for age, race, clinic, season of blood draw,
physical activity, weight, and height. serum 25ohd was
not related to nonspine fracture incidence. in the
nhanes study (15), the risk of hip fractures in men and
women combined was compared for several categories of
serum 25ohd levels: below 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter), hip
fracture risk was 60% higher; below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/
liter), 45% higher; below 25 ng/ml (62.5 nmol/liter), 36%
higher; and below 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter), 13% higher
(nonsignificant). in a prospective swedish study, a comparison of hip fracture rates in ambulatory, elderly women
(age 75 yr) showed a 2-fold increase with a serum 25ohd
below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) (16). however, three small
studies found no associations between fractures and serum
25ohd (17–19), but there were some caveats—younger
subjects in one study (53 yr), high dropout rate and lack of
adjustment for confounders in the second, and old technology for measuring serum 25ohd in the third.
in looking at other outcomes, a longitudinal study of
bone loss over 4.4 yr in the osteoporotic fractures in men
(mros) study compared rates of bone loss in quartiles of
serum 25ohd (11). the rate of bone loss in the hip was
as follows: serum 25ohd below 15 ng/ml (37.5 nmol/
liter), 0.59%/yr; 15–20 ng/ml (37.5–50 nmol/liter),
0.54%/yr; 20 –30 ng/ml (50 –75 nmol/liter), 0.35%/yr;
and above 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter), 0.37%/yr; thus, the
higher rates of bone loss occurred in the groups with serum
25ohd below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter). this relationship
was more apparent for the older men in the study, i.e. age
75⫹ yr. one other study in women of hip bone loss and

 xxxd2019xxx  and bone health

serum 25ohd did find an association with serum
25ohd levels (20).
what are the recommendations for populations with
 xxxd2019xxx  insufficiency with serum 25ohd below 20
ng/ml (50 nmol/liter)? to determine the optimum dose of
 xxxd2019xxx  for treatment of bone loss and fractures, it is
necessary to perform dose-response studies. in osteoporosis trials, study design tries to find a noneffective dose, a
minimum effective dose, and an optimum dose for benefit/
risk because higher doses often come with more adverse
events. these types of trials have never been done for  xxxd2019xxx , and so it is difficult to determine a threshold level
of serum 25ohd for efficacy from published data. consequently, one has to use an indirect approach and try to
estimate from serum 25ohd measurements a threshold
for efficacy. usually, the calculation of the recommended
daily allowance for  xxxd2019xxx  is based on achieving the
efficacy end point in 97.5% of the treated group. if those
data are not available, then an adequate intake is estimated
for 50% of the population. because of the lack of suitably
designed clinical trials, efficacy has to be estimated from
meta-analysis of osteoporosis studies. complicating the
picture is the fact that most  xxxd2019xxx  studies also include
calcium supplements that may have an interaction with
 xxxd2019xxx .
the best single-dose study is the placebo-controlled
whi trial of  xxxd1682xxx  plus calcium 1g/d (21).
baseline  xxxd2019xxx  intake of 365 iu increased the total
daily dose to approximately 765 iu, and baseline calcium
intake of 1150 mg/d increased the total intake to 2150
mg/d. in the intent-to-treat analysis, there was no significant effect on any fracture, but a complier analysis
(ⱖ80% of study medication used) showed a significant
effect on hip fracture reduction (hr, 0.71; 95% cl, 0.52–
0.97). in a subset of women, serum 25ohd at baseline
was 18.8 ng/ml (47 nmol/liter) and increased 28% to 24
ng/ml (60 nmol/liter) on  xxxd2019xxx . to prevent one hip
fracture, the number needed to treat was 5045 for all postmenopausal women and 1914 for women above age 60
yrs. of concern was the small but significant increase in
renal stones in the intent-to-treat analysis (hr, 1.17; 95%
cl, 1.02–1.34); it was not dependent on baseline calcium
intake, suggesting that adding  xxxd2019xxx  increased the
risk. in the whi trial, there was no decrease in all-cause
mortality on  xxxd2019xxx  plus calcium.
two high-quality meta-analyses (22, 23) with slightly
different inclusion criteria included 68,517 and 46,108
men and women from mostly  xxxd2019xxx -insufficient areas.
the conclusions were similar in that  xxxd2019xxx  alone is not
effective for fracture prevention (hr, 1.01; 95% cl,
0.92–1.12) (22), but  xxxd2019xxx  intake of at least 800 iu/d
combined with a calcium intake of 1000 –1200 mg/d is

j clin endocrinol metab, june 2010, 95(6):2630 –2633

effective for fracture prevention: hr, 0.92; 95% cl,
0.86 – 0.99 (22); and relative risk, 0.87; 95% cl, 0.77–
0.97 (23).
in summary, a convergence of the data suggests that an
optimal serum level of 25ohd for bone health is above 20
ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) and that treatment with a small dose
of  xxxd2019xxx  800 iu plus a total calcium intake of 1200
mg/d can reduce fractures.  xxxd2019xxx  and calcium have a
small effect on fracture risk reduction and are best used as
an adjunctive therapy with other osteoporosis drugs.
