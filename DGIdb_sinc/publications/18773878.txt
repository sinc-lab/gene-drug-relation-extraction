introduction

folate- and nucleotide-based inhibitors of thymidylate
synthetase (ts) continue to be used as main line therapies
for a number of cancers. ts inhibitors are presumed to exert

their therapeutic effects through dna damage resulting from
thymidylate deprivation, yet the precise types of dna damage
and dna damage signaling responses that occur following ts
inhibition remain incompletely understood. ts inhibition and
thymidylate deprivation can cause dna damage via several

inter-related mechanisms. ts inhibition causes an increase in
dutp, which can become incorporated into dna [1]. the base
excision repair (ber) pathway actively removes genomic uracil
[2]. ber requires a dna resynthesis step following excision,
but elevated dutp causes reintroduction of uracil into dna to
create a ‘futile cycling’ of ber [1]. additionally for fluoropyrimidines, the metabolite fdutp can be incorporated into dna,
which has received attention recently [3–5]. also, an implicit
but less explored source of dna damage caused by ts
inhibitors is stalled replication forks that eventually collapse
as a result of prolonged thymidylate deprivation and nucleotide pool imbalance.
there are a number of reasons to suspect the involvement
of homologous recombination (hr) following ts inhibition
regardless of which damage predominates. we have previously shown that the antifolate  xxxd3077xxx  (rtx, tomudextm), which is specific for ts, induces sister chromatid
exchanges, which are dna crossover events mediated by hr
[6]. hr is invoked as a means of resolving stalled replication
forks [7,8]. unresolved ber strand break intermediates appear
to be processed by hr [9]. thymidylate deprivation in s.
cerevisiae has been shown to induce recombination [10], and
there is evidence in murine cells that thymidylate deprivation
can induce events suggestive of recombination [11,12].
collectively, the observations suggest that hr is likely
involved in the response to thymidylate deprivation in
mammalian cells.
there are extensive links and crosstalk between hr and the
atm/atr-signaling pathways that respond to dna damage and
stalled replication forks [13]. replication protein a (rpa) is a
heterotrimeric protein that is essential for dna replication and
dna repair processes. its biochemical activity is to bind to and
presumably protect single strand dna generated during
replication. atm and atr phosphorylate the 32-kda subunit
(rpa2) of rpa at multiple sites in response to dna damage and
replication stress [14]. evidence suggests that atr is activated in
response to all types of replication stress, whereas the atm
response is specific for double strand breaks [13]. the downstream cascade includes the  xxxg442xxx  and  xxxg443xxx  signaling kinases
among targets that number in the hundreds [15]. the mrn
complex includes mre11,  xxxg1922xxx , and nbs1, a complex that
appears to act both upstream and downstream of atr signaling
via interactions with rpa [16,17]. recruitment of the mrn
complex then stimulates rad51 loading onto dna facilitated by
rpa, rad52, and brca2 to initiate homology searching [8].  xxxg442xxx 
has also been shown to be required for hr [18].
in this study, the activation of early dna damage responses
was examined, including phosphorylation of rpa and formation of damage foci in response to ts inhibition in ht-29 colon
adenocarcinoma cells, which have been used in studies of ts
inhibitors, and in hela cells, which have been extensively
used in studies of damage foci formation. we also depleted by
sirna the rad51 protein, which is a central component of hr.
we used rtx, which is specific for ts [19]. the goals were to
elucidate the dna damage signaling responses to thymidylate
deprivation and determine the involvement of hr. the results
demonstrate that an ic50 dose of rtx induces a potent sphase signaling response involving hr-associated proteins,
which suggests that these processes likely contribute to
cellular resistance to thymidylate deprivation.

chemicals and antibodies

hydroxyurea (hu), bovine albumin (bsa), thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (mtt), b-glycerophosphate,  xxxd26xxx  (bme), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (pmsf), sodium
fluoride, sodium bicarbonate,  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso),
giemsa stain, and sodium orthovanadate were purchased from
sigma (st. louis, mo).  xxxd3077xxx  (rtx) was generously
provided by astrazeneca (u.k.). anti-phospho-histone- xxxg1009xxx 
(serine 139) was purchased from upstate biotech (temecula,
ca). anti-rpa32 (rpa2) monoclonal antibody was purchased
from kamiya biomedical company (seattle, wa). anti-phospho-rpa2 (seine 4/serine 8) polyclonal antibody was purchased
from bethyl biotech inc. (montgomery, tx) and anti-rad51
polyclonal antibody was obtained from santa cruz biotech
(santa cruz, ca). anti-phospho-ps317- xxxg442xxx  and anti-phosphop95-nbs1 antibodies were purchased from cell signaling
technology (danvers, ma).

2.2.

cell culture, drug treatment, and western analysis

the ht-29 human colon cancer cells and hela human cervical
cancer cells were obtained from american type culture
collection (manassas, va), and maintained at 37 8c in a
humidified atmosphere and 5% co2 in dmem (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fbs (hyclone,
logan ut) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (invitrogen). a total
of 0.6  106 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes 24 h prior to
drug treatments for 24 h. untreated and treated cells were
then harvested, whole cell extracts prepared, and western
blots performed as described previously [6,20,21]. equal
protein loading was confirmed by b-actin (abcam, cambridge,
ma).

2.3.

cytotoxicity

viability and clonogenic assays were performed to determine
toxicity. viability was measured by mtt as described
previously [20]. in brief, 5000 cells were plated on 96-well
plates 24 h prior to treatment. cells were treated with various
concentrations of rtx for 24 h, and then grown in drug-free
medium for 3 days. mtt was added 5 h prior to pelleting the
cells, removing media and resuspending the dye in dmso.
absorbance was measured using a plate reader at 595 nm (biotek uv808 microplate reader, winooski, vt). cell viability and
ic50 values were calculated as a percentage compared to
untreated controls. colony-forming assays were performed as
previously described [20]. briefly, 1000 cells were seeded in
100-mm dishes 24 h prior to the addition of drug. following 10–
14 days, the cells were washed, fixed with methanol, and
stained with giemsa (sigma, st. louis, mo). colonies were
counted using an acolyte colony counter (symbiosis,
hingham, ma).

2.4.

rad51 knockdown

the pkd-rad51-v1 and non-expressing backbone control
vectors were purchased from upstate biotech (temecula,

biochemical pharmacology 76 (2008) 987–996

ca). the pkd-rad51-v1 vector expresses a short hairpin small
rna that when intracellularly processed produces rad51
sirna. the vectors were mixed at a 1:2 ratio with fugene16
(roche, indianapolis, in) and transfected into ht-29 and hela
cells by drop-wise addition according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. cells were harvested after 24, 48, 72, and 96 h for
western analysis to determine the extent of knockdown. in the
colony-forming assay, 72 h after transfection cells were
treated for 24 h with the indicated concentration of rtx and
then plated.

2.5.

indirect immunofluorescence

prior to treatment (24 h), 3  105 log phase ht-29 or hela
cells were seeded in 12-well plates containing coverslips
pretreated with collagen and uv. cells were treated in
media containing 30 nm rtx solution or an equal volume of
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) for the untreated control
for 24 h. after treatment, the coverslips were washed with
cold hanks’ balanced buffer and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. after washing, cells
were permeablized with 0.3% triton x-100 in pbs for 15 min.
coverslips were washed and blocked with 2.5% milk in pbs
at 4 8c overnight. after washing, coverslips were incubated
with primary antibody at 4 8c overnight. primary antibodies
were used at the following ratios: anti-rad51, 1:500; antirpa2, 1:500; anti-phospho- xxxg442xxx , 1:1000; anti-gh2ax 1:1000;
anti-phospho-nbs1 1:500. secondary antibody incubation
with alexa fluor 568 anti-mouse igg and alexa fluor 488
anti-rabbit igg at ratio (1: 250) was for 1 h at room
temperature (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). after 10 washes
with cold pbs, the coverslips were mounted by using
prollong1 gold antifade with dapi (invitrogen), dried
completely, sealed and stored in the dark. image data were
captured with a zeiss axiovert 200 m fluorescence microscope with axiovision rel 4.5 software, and a 63 objective
under oil. adobe1 photoshop software cs was used to
analyze images and nih image j software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) was used to quantify data by counting foci
number in at least 50 cells per sample, with a foci intensity
of at least 30 intensity units. cells were scored as positive
for damage-induced foci if there were 10 spots per cell for
ht-29 and 5 for hela. the threshold levels to score foci as
positive for co-localization were a foci size of at least four
pixels and 200 intensity units. co-localization was scored as
a percent of the number of spots containing at least 25%
yellow compared to the total number of foci. the averaged
data are from three independent experiments.

2.6.

flow cytometry for dna content

flow cytometry experiments were performed in similar
fashion to those described previously [20,21]. briefly, exponentially growing cells (1.5  106) were seeded 24 h prior to
treatment. cells were treated with rtx or hu at the doses
listed in the text for 24 h. cells were harvested, washed twice
with cold pbs, fixed with cold 70% ethanol, and washed with
1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  in phosphate buffered saline. after
staining overnight (50 mg/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide, 0.1 mg/ml of
 xxxg1963xxx  and 1% bsa in pbs), dna content was analyzed by

989

using a cytomics fc-500 flow cytometer with cxp software
version 2.2 (beckmen coulter, fullerton, ca).

results

3.1.

relationship between rtx treatment and rad51

rad51 plays a central role in strand exchange during hr.
rad51 protein in ht-29 cells was modestly induced by rtx
treatment (20–60%, n = 3), although the induction did not
increase with higher doses (fig. 1a). in order to investigate the
role of rad51 more directly, we transiently depleted rad51
protein by sirna. mice in which the rad51 gene has been
disrupted are early embryonic lethal and knockout cells fail to
proliferate [22–24]. transient antisense rna expression was
reported to reduce rad51 levels [25], so we performed
transient sirna knockdown of rad51. fig. 1b shows a
reduction of rad51 protein at 72 and 96 h following transfection of the rad51 shrna vector, while there was no change in
rad51 levels following transfection of the negative control
vector. by densitometry, the shrna vector reduced rad51
protein levels by approximately 85% and 76% in hela cells and
84% and 72% in ht-29 cells at 72 and 96 h post transfection,
respectively (fig. 1b). cell viability following transfection
showed that the fugene transfection reagent alone reduced
cell viability by 20% compared to mock treated (data not
shown). no difference in viability was seen between cells
treated with fugene alone or fugene plus rad51shrna or

rad51 (rad51 shrna). rad51 protein was measured by
western blot. lanes labeled ‘‘mock’’ represent cells treated
with fugene transfection reagent alone and ‘‘vector’’

densitometry, the shrna vector reduced rad51 protein by
approximately 85% and 76% in hela cells (upper panel)
and 78% and 50% in ht-29 cells (lower panel) at 72 and
96 h post transfection, respectively.

negative control vector, indicating that the rad51shrna
vector did not reduce viability under these conditions. by
viability assay, the ic50 for rtx in the absence of fugene was
42 and 30 nm in hela and ht-29 cells, respectively (data not
shown), which provided the dose range to utilize for colonyforming assays following transient knockdown. colonyforming assays were performed to compare cell survival
following rtx treatment in cells transfected with
rad51shrna vector versus the negative control vector, which
were performed instead of viability assays due to the duration
of the experiment. fig. 2 shows that hela (fig. 2a) and ht-29
(fig. 2b) cells expressing the rad51shrna were 20–40% more
sensitive to rtx than cells harboring the negative control
vector ( p < 0.01).

3.2.

rpa is phosphorylated in response to rtx

rpa is a heterotrimeric protein of which the rpa2 (32 kda)
subunit is phosphorylated at multiple sites in response to
replication stress. fig. 3 shows that rtx treatment induced
phosphorylation of rpa2 in hela (fig. 3a) and ht-29 (fig. 3b)
cells from a subtoxic dose to an ic50 dose, as measured by the
appearance of a band detected by an anti-phospho-rpa2
antibody. a supratoxic dose of rtx (500 nm) did not

fig. 3 – rpa2 is phosphorylated in response to ts
inhibition. hela (a) and ht-29 (b) cells were treated with
increasing rtx or hu for 24 h, and then analyzed for
phosphorylated rpa2 (p-rpa2) with an anti-phosphoser4/ser8 rpa2 antibody. rpa2 was detected with an antirpa antibody. human rpa2 purified from e. coli served as
a control (left-most lane in the upper panel). b-actin served
as the loading control.

significantly increase phosphorylated rpa beyond that seen
for the ic50 dose in each cell line. rpa from untreated hela and
ht-29 cells migrated the same as human rpa protein purified
from e. coli (fig. 3a and data not shown, respectively).
hydroxyurea (hu) is commonly used to induce s-phase arrest
because it blocks ribonucleotide reductase, thus preventing
dntp synthesis. in agreement with a number of previous
studies, hu induced rpa2 phosphorylation in hela cells at
doses of 400 and 800 mm (fig. 3a, last two lanes on right). for
reference, the approximate ic50 for hu in hela and ht-29 cells
is 200 mm (data not shown). interestingly, hu did not induce
rpa2 phosphorylation in ht-29 cells until supratoxic doses of
1.6 and 5 mm were used (fig. 3b, last two lanes on right),
suggesting that there is a distinct difference in s-phase
checkpoint signaling induced by rtx versus hu in the ht-29
cells.

transfected with empty control vector 72 h prior to rtx
treatment. open bars represent cells transfected with
rad51 shrna vector 72 h prior to rtx treatment. each bar
is an average of three independent experiments (error
bars are the standard deviation).

focal points of localization for multiple proteins detected by
immunofluorescence are well known phenomena following
dna damage. rpa focalization was examined in comparison
to rad51 and other key dna damage signaling proteins. at a
dose of 30 nm rtx, rpa foci were readily apparent in hela
cells (fig. 4a). quantification is shown in fig. 6a, in which
>95% of the cells were scored as positive with 5 foci per cell
(section 2). foci were even more striking in ht-29 cells treated
with 30 nm rtx (fig. 4b). even at a mildly toxic dose of 5 nm
rtx, rpa foci were seen in 80% of ht-29 cells (data not
shown). fig. 4 also shows that rad51 foci were induced by rtx
treatment in both cell types, implicating the initiation of hr.

examined by immunofluorescence (section 2). the columns are representative dapi-stained (blue), rad51 (green), rpa2
(red), and merged images of cells. (for interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to

rad51 was 56% for hela and 75% for ht-29 following rtx
treatment. rpa and rad51 foci were induced in both cell types
treated with 5 mm hu, which is within a dose range commonly
reported in studies of hu-induced damage foci and induced
rpa phosphorylation (fig. 3), yet was well beyond the ic50 of
200 mm for each cell line. we also observed phospho-rpa foci
in response to rtx in the hela and ht-29 cells (supplementary fig. 1). phospho-rpa foci induced by hu were evident in
the hela but not ht-29 cells, in agreement with the results
shown in fig. 3b.
phosphorylation of the  xxxg1009xxx  protein is a
presumptive marker of dna double strand break induction,
replicational stress, and is seen following hu treatment [26].
we previously observed by western blot that rtx treatment
induced g- xxxg1009xxx  [21]. rtx-induced g- xxxg1009xxx  foci were
extensively induced, similar to that seen for rpa and

rad51 (fig. 5a). interestingly, g- xxxg1009xxx  foci overlap with
rpa foci to a lesser extent than rad51, by 50% (fig. 6b). a
lack of co-localization between rpa and g- xxxg1009xxx  has been
noted [27].  xxxg442xxx  is known to be a downstream target
phosphorylated by atm/atr and an important regulator of
s-phase progression. distinct p- xxxg442xxx  foci were induced
following rtx treatment in hela and ht-29 cells (fig. 5b). as
part of the mrn complex, nbs1 is known to be a key target
of phosphorylation during s-phase checkpoint signaling.
foci containing p-nbs1 were easily detectable following rtx
treatment in ht-29 and hela cells (fig. 5c). the extent of colocalization for p- xxxg442xxx  and p-nbs1 with rpa foci were
similar (fig. 5b). collectively, the results demonstrate that
rtx-induced thymidylate deprivation induces a robust
focalization of a number of dna damage signaling proteins
at doses at or below the ic50 for each cell line.

3.4.

cell cycle response to rtx and hu

we have previously shown that rtx induces a potent s-phase
arrest in mefs and hek293 cells [20,21]. cell cycle responses
following rtx or hu exposure for 24 h were measured to
confirm that the damage-induced foci were occurring during
s-phase (fig. 7). from top to bottom, the first four left-hand
panels in fig. 7 show that rtx induced an s-phase arrest in
ht-29 cells, 60–71% of cells in s-phase compared to 13% for the
untreated control. even a dose of 10 nm (3-fold below the ic50
of 30 nm) induced a potent arrest. sub g1 (apoptotic) cells do
not yet appear at 24 h treatment times, in agreement with our
previous studies on rtx in other cell types indicating that

apoptosis begins 12–24 h after a 24 h treatment [6,20,21].
treatment of ht-29 cells with increasing doses of hu
produced an s-phase arrest similar to that seen for rtx,
although the distribution of cells in late s-phase and g2/m
appeared to decrease. the right hand top four panels show
that rtx induced an s-phase arrest in hela cells at 30 and
100 nm, with 77 and 86% of the cells in s-phase compared to
12% for the untreated control (ic50 of 42 nm in hela). the
response of hela cells to hu was similar in that 79–86% of the
cells appeared to be arrested in s-phase. collectively, the
results confirm that the rtx- and hu-induced rpa phosphorylation and foci formation of s-phase checkpoint signaling
proteins occurred during s-phase arrest at the doses used.

discussion

to our knowledge, this study is the first to directly demonstrate
that depletion of rad51 in mammalian cells leads to increased
sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced thymidylate deprivation.
other studies have noted increases in rad51 expression in
tumor cells and associations with radioresistance, recently
reviewed in [28]. immunofluorescence confirmed that rad51
foci accumulate as a result of rtx treatment, suggesting that
thymidylate deprivation induces hr events. dna double strand
breaks (dsbs) have been reported following treatment with
antifolate ts inhibitors including rtx [29,30], although it has
not been directly demonstrated whether ber futile cycling and/
or stalled replication forks were the source of dsbs. we
previously noted by western blot that rtx treatment induced
g- xxxg1009xxx  in hek293 cells independent of the activity of the ung
dna glycosylase [21]. immunofluorescence in the hela and ht29 cells confirmed that g- xxxg1009xxx  focalization occurs following
rtx treatment. hyperphosphorylated rpa and g- xxxg1009xxx  foci
formation have been observed following treatment with agents
that alkylate dna in the minor groove or induce dsbs, although

listed and examined by flow cytometry (section 2). the top
row is untreated cells. the second, third, and fourth rows
are cells treated with increasing concentrations of rtx.
the fifth through seventh rows are cells treated with hu.

co-localization of the two was not extensive [27]. phosphorylation of  xxxg1009xxx  occurs in response to replication stress induced by
hu or aphidicolin [31]. however, g- xxxg1009xxx  foci following hu
treatment are typically the result of supratoxic concentrations
(2 mm), and it is not definitive whether stalled replication
forks cause g- xxxg1009xxx , or forks must collapse into a dsb to induce
g- xxxg1009xxx . in contrast, rtx strikingly induces g- xxxg1009xxx  foci at or
below ic50 doses. the results suggest that thymidylate
deprivation induces a more potent dna damage signaling
response as opposed to deoxynucleotide deprivation induced
by hu.
molecular markers of s-phase signaling events were
examined because there appear to be intimate links between
hr and s-checkpoint signaling proteins. the phosphorylation
of rpa2 is thought to be one of the earliest responses to a
replication fork that has stalled after encountering damage
[32]. the data show that rpa2 is phosphorylated and forms

994

biochemical pharmacology 76 (2008) 987–996

damage-induced foci in response to rtx. atr is thought to be
the kinase responsible for rpa2 phsophorylation in response
to replication stress, although  xxxg442xxx  is also capable [33].
deficiency in  xxxg442xxx  (or inhibition with ucn-01) leads to
increased initiation of replication, atr activation, and strand
breaks [34].  xxxg442xxx  appears to regulate hr via interactions with
and phosphorylation of rad51 [18]. it has also been shown
that ts inhibitors induce  xxxg442xxx  phosphorylation [35], and  xxxg442xxx 
deficiency sensitizes cells to 5-fu [36,37]. the data in fig. 5
demonstrates that p- xxxg442xxx  forms foci following rtx treatment. focalization of p-nbs1 was examined because of
reported interactions between rpa and the mrn complex,
of which nbs1 is part [16,17]. the data supports the notion that
phosphorylation and focalization of nbs1 occurs as part of a
broader s-phase checkpoint in response to multiple types of
dna damage [38]. to our knowledge, the data provide the first
demonstration that thymidylate deprivation induces foci of
rad51, rpa2, g- xxxg1009xxx , p- xxxg442xxx , and p-nbs1. the striking
induction of these foci at or below ic50 doses of rtx in two
different cell lines suggests that processes associated with hr
initiation respond to the dna damage caused by thymidylate
deprivation and thus are relevant to cell death caused by
chemotherapeutic ts inhibitors. data from flow cytometry
confirmed that rtx- and hu-induced s-phase arrest in hela
and ht-29 cells at the doses used to induce rpa2 phosphorylation and co-localization of s-phase checkpoint signaling
proteins.
analyses in e. coli and s. cerevisiae have suggested that
thymidylate deprivation invokes hr mechanisms, which are
protective [10,39–43]. in mammalian systems, evidence for the
involvement of hr is largely lacking [44], aside from induction
of sister chromatid exchanges by the antifolates methotrexate
[45] and rtx [6], and suggestive evidence in a murine system
utilizing a heterologous human ts gene [12]. in a separate but
related study, waldman and coworkers directly investigated
recombination in human cells treated with rtx using a model
system to study intrachromosomal homologous recombination and provide what we believe is the first definitive evidence
that ts inhibition can stimulate accurate recombination
events in human cells [46]. we believe that the evidence
presented here and in the related study strongly implicate hr
mechanisms as part of the cellular response to thymidylate
deprivation, which is perhaps not surprising given that hr is a
means of resolving collapsed replication forks and persistent
ber strand break intermediates. a number of studies
examining ber proficient and deficient mammalian cells have
not provided consistent evidence that ber futile cycling occurs
during thymidylate deprivation [3,6,20,21,47–49]. considering
the myriad cell types including cancer cells and murine
embryonic fibroblasts used in the above-mentioned studies,
the results presented here suggest that defects in dna damage
signaling checkpoints and hr status may be an underlying
modulator of the contribution of ber. for example, among
commonly used colorectal cancer cell lines, hct 116 and lovo
cells are defective for mre11 and thus do not form mre11/
 xxxg1922xxx /nbs1 foci in response to ionizing radiation, while ht29 cells can form mre11/ xxxg1922xxx /nbs1 foci [50]. there is
evidence in c. elegans that the clk-2 kinase plays a role in
response to ber intermediates generated by uracil dna
glycosylase [51]. future studies elucidating the links among

ber, dna damage signaling circuitry and hr will help
determine the precise contribution of these processes to
toxicity induced by ts inhibitors.
