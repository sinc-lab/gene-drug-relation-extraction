 xxxg2239xxx  displays species-dependent stereoselectivity for isomers of methamphetamine, amphetamine, and para-hydroxyampheta...  the synthetic amines methamphetamine (meth), amphetamine (amph), and their metabolite para-hydroxyamphetamine (poha) are chemically and structurally related to the catecholamine neurotransmitters and a small group of endogenous biogenic amines collectively referred to as the trace amines (tas). recently, it was reported that meth, amph, poha, and the tas para-tyramine (tyr) and  xxxd2901xxx  (pea) stimulate camp production in human embryonic kidney (hek)-293 cells expressing rat  xxxg2239xxx  (rtaar1). the discovery that meth and amph activate the rtaar1 motivated us to study the effect of these drugs on the mouse taar1 (mtaar1) and a human-rat chimera (hrchtaar1). furthermore, because s-(+)-isomers of meth and amph are reported to be more potent and efficacious in vivo than r-(-), we determined the enantiomeric selectivity of all three species of taar1. in response to meth, amph, or poha exposure, the accumulation of camp by hek-293 cells stably expressing different species of taar1 was concentration- and isomer-dependent. ec50 values for s-(+)-meth were 0.89, 0.92, and 4.44 microm for rtaar1, mtaar1, and h-rchtaar1, respectively. pea was a potent and full agonist at each species of taar1, whereas tyr was a full agonist for the rodent taar1s but was a partial agonist at h-rchtaar1. interestingly, both isomers of meth were full agonists at mtaar1 and h-rchtaar1, whereas both were partial agonists at rtaar1. taken together, these in vitro results suggest that, in vivo, taar1 could be a novel mediator of the effects of these drugs.
