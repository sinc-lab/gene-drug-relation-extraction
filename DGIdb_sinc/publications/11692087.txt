cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases
david m. essayan, md rockville, md

cyclic nucleotide second messengers (camp and cgmp) play
a central role in signal transduction and regulation of physiologic responses. their intracellular levels are controlled by the
complex superfamily of  xxxg1696xxx 
(pde) enzymes. continuing advances in our understanding of
the molecular pharmacology of these enzymes has led to the
development of selective inhibitors as therapeutic agents for
disease states ranging from cancer and heart failure to depression and sexual dysfunction. several pde types have been
identified as therapeutic targets for immune/inflammatory diseases. this article briefly reviews the available in vitro, preclinical, and clinical data supporting the potential for selective
pde inhibitors as immunomodulatory agents. (j allergy clin
immunol 2001;108:671-80.)

the social use of phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitors,
such as caffeine, dates back several millennia; their continued popularity is suggested by the fact that 3 of the top
25 most valued brand-name companies on the world market are purveyors of caffeinated beverages.1 the medicinal use of pde inhibitors can be traced to the work of
henry hyde salter in his monograph of 1860 entitled
“on asthma: its pathology and treatment.” in that work,
salter recommends the administration of “two breakfast
cups of strong coffee . . . given on an empty stomach” as
a remedy that “in many cases is more efficacious than
any other.” interestingly, such a dosing regimen would
optimize absorption, achieve high peak serum levels, and
specifically target the exaggerated diurnal variation in
pulmonary function characteristic of asthma.2 however,
it was not until 1957 that our mechanistic understanding
of cyclic nucleotides and pdes began to evolve. in that
year, sutherland and rall3,4 first described the properties

from the division of clinical trials design and analysis and the division of
cellular and gene therapies, office of therapeutics research and review,
center for biologics evaluation and research, us food and drug administration.

of a cyclic adenine ribonucleotide (later called adenosine
3′, 5′-cyclic monophosphate [camp]), its formation in
response to epinephrine and glucagon, and inhibition of
its hydrolysis by sodium fluoride and caffeine. as the
importance of cyclic nucleotide second messengers in
cellular signaling and homeostasis became evident over
the ensuing decades, pharmacologic regulation of this
pathway by pde inhibitors became an area of both academic and pharmaceutical industry research. in the
1970s, 2 separate observations focused this research
effort on immune/inflammatory diseases. first, in a
series of reports by lichtenstein and colleagues, the
immunomodulatory properties of camp and the antiinflammatory potential of pde inhibitors were demonstrated.5-7 second, several groups demonstrated that pde
activity from tissue homogenates could be fractionated
into pharmacokinetically and biologically distinct pde
subtypes and that the relative amounts of these pdes varied among different tissues.8-10 thus the superfamily of
pde enzymes was born and the potential utility of selective pde inhibitors to target specific tissues, pathways,
and disease processes was first postulated.
this year marks the 30th anniversary of the description of
camp as an immunomodulator. the superfamily of pdes
has burgeoned to 14 subtypes and more than 50 distinct isoforms. several selective pde inhibitors have been marketed; several others have gained notoriety for their toxicities.
clinical trials of selective pde inhibitors continue, but the
therapeutic promise of selective pde inhibitors for inflammatory diseases is yet to be realized. the structural chemistry and molecular biology of pdes have been reviewed
elsewhere.11,12 this article will update our understanding of
the classification and pharmacology of pdes and the in
vitro and in vivo evidence for immunomodulatory activity
associated with inhibition of specific pde subtypes.13

classification and structural
biology
table i shows the current classification scheme for
cyclic nucleotide pdes. eleven distinct families (or types)
are differentiated functionally on the basis of substrate
specificity and sensitivity to endogenous/exogenous regulators and genetically on the basis of sequence homology (3
additional families have been reported, but the data available at this time are insufficient for their inclusion in table
i).13-17 most of the families include more than 1 gene product (subtype, designated with a letter following the family
number—eg,  xxxg1700xxx ). multiple splice variants (isoforms,
designated with a number following the subtype letter—eg,
pde4d1), each with different functional and regulatory
characteristics, may exist for any given gene product.18,19
the number of specific human pdes is thus well over 50.
several of the more commonly used selective inhibitors of
each of the pde families are listed in table i; well-known
nonselective inhibitors include caffeine, theophylline,  xxxd2880xxx , and  xxxd2388xxx .13 although
type-selective inhibitors offer the potential for specificity of
pharmacologic effect, the structural similarities and apparent functional redundancy within subtypes and isoforms
have renewed concerns for the identification and utility of
more highly selective agents.20,21 nevertheless, the recent
reports of decreased bronchial hyperresponsiveness in
 xxxg1700xxx  knockout mice has re-energized the field of pde
research for atopic diseases.22
pdes are composed of 3 broad functional domains: a
regulatory n-terminus, a central catalytic domain, and a
regulatory c-terminus.23 the catalytic domains are highly homologous across families (>50% sequence identity
at the amino acid level). the n-terminal and c-terminal
domains display moderate homology within families and
impart to specific subtypes and isoforms their unique
functional fingerprints. the n-terminus is involved in
allosteric regulation (calmodulin, cyclic nucleotide, and
metal ion binding; phosphorylation sites) and membrane
targeting.24-30 recent data suggest that the c-terminus
may be involved in dimerization and possess docking
sites for pde-specific kinases.24,31

pharmacology
the general schema for the formation and degradation
of cyclic nucleotides is depicted in fig 1.  xxxd1773xxx 
and guanosine 3′, 5′-cyclic monophosphate (cgmp) are
formed from their respective triphosphates by the catalytic activity of adenylyl cyclase (ac) or guanylyl
cyclase (gc), respectively. these cyclases exist in multiple isoforms (9 for ac; 11 for gc). each isoform has a
specific tissue and cellular distribution, and each couples
specifically to discrete sets of receptors for signal transduction.32 some isoforms are regulated by transactivators such as calmodulin, whereas others are sensitive to
phosphorylation.33 thus, adenylyl and  xxxg1587xxx 
are able to integrate a vast array of direct and cross-talk
signals and to do so differently in different cell types.

cyclic nucleotides are degraded by pde-catalyzed
hydrolytic cleavage of the 3′-phosphodiester bond,
resulting in formation of the corresponding inactive 5′monophosphate. pde inhibitors block this hydrolytic
activity, causing accumulation of cyclic nucleotides corresponding to the type-specificity of the inhibitor used
(eg, accumulation of camp when inhibiting a campspecific pde such as pde4). interestingly, activation of
ac or gc fails to induce more than transient alterations
in cyclic nucleotides because of compensatory increases
in pde activity; however, concomitant cyclase activation
and pde inhibition produce synergistic effects on cyclic
nucleotide steady-state levels.34,35
specific pde isoforms display remarkably selective
cellular and subcellular localizations.18,36,37 thus, compartmentalization of pde activities possessing discrete
pharmacokinetic and regulatory characteristics likely
plays an important role in the maintenance of cellular
homeostasis. this type of compartmentalization may
also contribute to rapid and reversible cross-talk between
pde families and isoforms; a local shift in cyclic
nucleotide content within one of these subcellular pools
through the activity of one pde might affect allosteric
regulation or active site competition on another pde.38,39
clearly, pharmacologic regulation of pdes must account
for a complex set of variables.
cyclic nucleotides transduce signals through direct
protein binding. the best characterized of these protein
targets are the cyclic nucleotide–dependent protein kinases, cak and cgk. each is composed of 2 major subtypes
(caki and cakii; cgki and cgkii); each subtype is
composed of several isoforms.40,41 cyclic ak and cgk
are serine-threonine kinases, each a tetramer of 2 regulatory subunits coupled to 2 catalytic subunits. when activated through cooperative binding of 4 cyclic nucleotide
molecules, the 2 regulatory domains disengage from the 2
catalytic domains. these catalytic domains are then free
to translocate within the cell and phosphorylate specific
targets including transcription regulators, ion channels,
and signaling proteins.42-45 this translocation is not a random process. in the case of cak, subcellular targeting is
enhanced by the family of a kinase anchor proteins
(akaps, at least 20 isoforms, each differentially regulated and expressed in specific tissues). akaps’ hydrophobic docking sites bind the catalytic subunits of cak, and
their coiled coil regions interact with various structural or
functional proteins to complete the targeting process.46-50
interestingly, targets for regulation by cak and cgk
include ac and gc, several akaps, and several pdes.
thus, multiple levels of degeneracy, cross-talk, and feedback create a cyclic nucleotide–mediated signaling network of extreme complexity.
two final points concerning cyclic nucleotide signaling should be underscored. first, the cyclic nucleotide
signaling cascade engages in cross-talk with several
other critical signaling pathways. for example, cak targets  xxxg1924xxx  in the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway, whereas  xxxg1366xxx  kinase targets several isoforms of
pde4.21 moreover, several pathways may independently

fig 1. cyclic nucleotide signaling and homeostasis. activation of acs (1) results in the generation of camp
from  xxxd83xxx  (atp; 2). four molecules of camp cooperatively bind to the 2 regulatory subunits of inactive cak (3), resulting in disengagement of 2 active catalytic subunits that are capable of protein phosphorylation (4). the hydrolysis of camp to inactive 5′- xxxd81xxx  (5′amp) is catalyzed by various camp-specific pdes (5).

regulate cyclic nucleotide downstream effectors (a
process called convergence). for example, both cak and
the immunoglobulin fc signaling cascades target the
transcription factor creb at different sites on the molecule and exert different effects.51,52 the outcome of cross

talk or convergence may be either inhibition or enhancement of signaling. second, the cyclic nucleotide pathway
undergoes autoregulation. for example, transcription of
several pde genes are under the control of cyclic
nucleotide regulatory elements, and several pde proteins

in vitro effects
inflammatory cells are exquisitely sensitive to alterations in cyclic nucleotide levels; interestingly, modulation of immune cell function by selective pde inhibitors
is limited to specific pde types, probably as a result of
compartmentalization of cyclic nucleotide and pde
pools. in immune cells, elevation of intracellular camp,
mediated predominantly through inhibition of pde4,
results in a wide range of anti-inflammatory effects, as
summarized in table ii.

basophils and mast cells
human basophils contain primarily  xxxg1695xxx , pde4, and
pde5. inhibition of pde4 has been shown to downregulate anti-ige–induced histamine release and leukotriene
c4 (ltc4) generation,  xxxd2973xxx –induced
histamine release, and dust mite antigen–induced il-4 and
il-13 generation from human basophils.55-59 although
 xxxg1695xxx  and pde5 inhibitors show little independent efficacy in regulating these functions,  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors may
potentiate the activity of pde4 inhibitors on several of
these activities.56,57,59 finally, functional immunomodulation is closely correlated with intracellular camp levels;
synergy is observed with pde4 inhibitors and  xxxd1742xxx .58
to date, there are no studies probing the potential utility of
inhibitors targeting  xxxg1704xxx -pde11.

human mast cells contain both  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4. interestingly, although some investigators have reported that
pde4 inhibitors downregulate ige-mediated calcium fluxes, histamine release, and cytokine generation, several
groups have reported resistance of mast cell mediator
release to pde4 inhibition and have correlated this resistance with a lack of pde4-mediated increases in intracellular camp.58,60-63 differences in cellular substrate for
these studies (skin and lung fragments vs purified mast
cells vs cultured mast cells) may account for some of these
discrepancies. this remains an area of unresolved debate.

eosinophils
human eosinophils contain both  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4.64
pde4 inhibitors block a variety of eosinophil functions,
including superoxide generation, ltc4 production,
 xxxg1206xxx / xxxg1209xxx  upregulation and l-selectin shedding,
chemotaxis, and survival; inhibitors of  xxxg1695xxx  show no
independent efficacy in downregulating eosinophil functions.65-71 several recent reports suggest both synergy
between ac activators and pde4 inhibitors in downregulating various eosinophil functions and reversal of the
effects of pde4 inhibitors on freshly isolated human
eosinophils by cak antagonists.35,71 the effects of pde4
inhibitors on eosinophil-derived cytokine generation and
the potential roles of  xxxg1704xxx -pde11 have not been reported.

lymphocytes
b lymphocytes contain  xxxg1695xxx , pde4, and  xxxg1704xxx .72 several authors have described complex relationships between
intracellular camp, il-4, and ige synthesis. unfortunately, these studies have been performed in mixed cell populations in which the concomitant effects of t cells and
accessory cells are not adequately controlled.73-75 however, even studies with purified b cells have yielded seemingly contradictory results. whereas proliferation of polyclonally stimulated, purified b lymphocytes is enhanced
by pde4 inhibitors, cak activation results in inhibition of
b-cell receptor–mediated proliferation and enhanced
apoptosis that is subject to rescue by il-4.72,76 finally,
although pde4 inhibitors have been shown to reduce
spontaneous ige release from mononuclear cells isolated
from allergic subjects, these effects have not been
observed with purified b cells.77,78 the effects of pde
inhibition on synthesis of other immunoglobulin classes,
b-cell differentiation, and cytokine generation have not
been reported. this is an area with great research potential.
in addition to  xxxg1695xxx , pde4, and  xxxg1704xxx , t lymphocytes
express pde1, pde2, pde5, and pde8. the distribution
of pde types is nearly identical in cd4+ and cd8+ lymphocytes, but subtype and isoform expression may vary
among t-cell phenotypes and in disease states.64,79-81 in
general, pde4 inhibitors downregulate mitogen-, antigen, and allogeneic hla class ii–induced blastogenesis and
t-cell proliferation. although  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors show little
or no independent efficacy in these models, they do synergize with the pde4 inhibitors. pde5 inhibitors are ineffective.80,82-84 pde4 inhibitors also downregulate mitogen- or antigen-induced production of many th1- and

th2-derived proinflammatory cytokines, including il-2,
il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-13,  xxxg1141xxx , tnf, and gm-csf; interestingly, upregulation of il-10 has also been reported.79,80,85,86
once again, although  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors show no independent efficacy in these models, they do synergize with
pde4 inhibitors. more recently, pde4 inhibitors were
shown to downregulate adhesion molecule expression on
t cells and promote neoantigen tolerance in murine t
cells.87-89 finally, inhibition of  xxxg1704xxx  through use of antisense technology has demonstrated efficacy in downregulating  xxxd2676xxx - anti-cd-28–mediated proliferation and
il-2 production.90 the functional role of pde8-pde11 in
t lymphocytes has not been pursued.

monocytes/macrophages/dendritic cells
human monocytes contain  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4;
macrophages retain pde4 and upregulate  xxxg1695xxx  while
gaining pde1 and pde5; dendritic cells downregulate
pde4, upregulate  xxxg1695xxx , and gain only pde5.64,91,92
these data underscore the importance of pdes in the differentiation and maintenance of immunologic phenotypes. inhibition of pde4 markedly downregulates  xxxg2296xxx  production and  xxxd208xxx  release/lt generation
from monocytes.55,93,94 interestingly, pde4 inhibitors do
not modulate superoxide,  xxxd2738xxx , il-6, or il-8 production from human monocytes.95-97 although the data
concerning pde4 inhibitor effects on  xxxg1170xxx  production
from monocytes are conflicting, pde4 inhibitors consistently upregulate il-10 production from these
cells.86,98,99 inhibition of pde4 in macrophages is associated with weak downregulation of tnf-alpha and  xxxg1170xxx 
production and  xxxd208xxx  release.99-101 interestingly, whereas  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors display only minimal
independent efficacy and variable synergy with pde4
inhibitors in monocytes, inhibition of  xxxg1695xxx  in
macrophages is associated with significant independent
suppression of tnf-alpha production,  xxxd2738xxx  generation, and il-10 secretion.99,102,103 these differences
between monocytes and macrophages may be attributable, in part, to maturation-induced changes in pde profile. pde4 inhibitors also downregulate t-cell help and
cytokine generation from dendritic cells; although  xxxg1695xxx 
inhibitors show marginal independent efficacy in dendritic cells, they show marked synergy with pde4
inhibitors.67,92 the effects of pde inhibitors on adhesion
molecule expression and antigen presentation have not
been reported; the potential roles of pde1, pde5, and
 xxxg1704xxx  through pde11 have not been explored.

neutrophils
neutrophils contain predominantly pde4. inhibitors of
pde4 enhance intracellular calcium resequestration and
decrease degranulation, superoxide and lt production,
elastase and il-8 secretion, and  xxxg1206xxx  surface expression.55,65,104-106 interestingly, pde4 inhibitors also antagonize proapoptotic signals in neutrophils.107 whereas
 xxxg1695xxx  and pde5 inhibitors show little or no efficacy in
modulating these cellular functions, ac inducers act in an
additive or synergistic fashion with pde4 inhibitors in

676 essayan

downregulating most neutrophil cellular functions.105,106,108 the potential roles of pdes other than
 xxxg1695xxx , pde4, and pde5 have not been explored.

endothelial cells
endothelial cells contain predominantly pde2,  xxxg1695xxx ,
and pde4, with lesser contribution of pde1, pde5, and
 xxxg1704xxx .109-111 whereas pde4 inhibitors decrease calcium
fluxes and growth factor secretion,  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors
decrease  xxxg357xxx , and the
combination of  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 inhibitors downregulates
hyperpermeability,  xxxg2406xxx  expression, and  xxxg2048xxx 
expression (but not icam-1 expression).109,112-115

in vivo effects
pde inhibitors have been evaluated as potential antidepressants, anti-inflammatory agents, antiproliferative
agents, antihypertensive and cardiovascular agents, and
cytoprotective agents.13,116-120 to date, clinical development of selective pde inhibitors has focused primarily on
 xxxg1695xxx , pde4, and pde5. despite early promise, clinical
development of  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors for congestive heart failure was essentially abandoned because of a concomitant
increase in the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias; interest in
the role of  xxxg1695xxx  in adipocyte metabolism remains.121,122
although their postulated cardiovascular utility was not
realized, a pde5 inhibitor has been marketed for the treatment of male sexual dysfunction; interestingly, the neuroophthalmologic side effects of sildenafil may be attributed
to cross-reactivity on photoreceptor pde6 and not to the
trace presence of pde5 in the eye.123,124 the only currently available pde inhibitors for the treatment of
immune/inflammatory diseases are the nonselective xanthine derivatives ( xxxd150xxx , theophylline, etc); these
have been reviewed elsewhere.125,126 although pde1,
 xxxg1695xxx , and pde5 inhibitors show little or no independent
efficacy for this indication, pde4 inhibitors have demonstrated activity in inhibiting antigen-induced bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness, antigen-induced
eosinophil infiltration, and local cytokine generation in a
variety of preclinical models for pulmonary allergic
inflammation.127-130 unfortunately, clinical trials with
pde4 inhibitors have demonstrated dose-limiting toxicity
due to gastric hypersecretion and emesis; this toxicity is
poorly reproduced in rodents and nonhuman primates but
is modeled well in ferrets.131
published results of clinical trials with selective pde
inhibitors remain quite limited. several combined
 xxxg1695xxx /pde4 inhibitors (benzafentrine,  xxxd3550xxx ) have
been administered; however, efficacy endpoints focused
primarily on bronchodilatation. the results of these studies have ranged from negative to mildly effective (roughly
equivalent to that of a beta2-agonist). anti-inflammatory endpoints were not sought in these studies, the studies were
not clearly of sufficient duration to evaluate an antiinflammatory endpoint, and adverse events characteristic
of  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors limited the utility of these agents.132,133
tibenalast, a weak first-generation pde4 inhibitor, was

j allergy clin immunol
november 2001

only minimally effective in improving pulmonary function
in a cohort of 40 asthmatic subjects treated in a doubleblinded, placebo-controlled crossover study; however, a
minimal adverse event profile in these subjects suggested
little evidence of systemic pde4 inhibition, and the dosing
regimen and duration of the study precluded assessment of
anti-inflammatory contributions to clinical efficacy.134
cp80,633, a moderate-strength first-generation pde4
inhibitor, was evaluated for topical use in 20 subjects with
atopic dermatitis. when used on symmetrically involved
disease sites over a 28-day period in a double-blinded and
paired comparison, cp80,633 induced clinical improvement in 20 of 20 subjects; the topical route of administration obviated systemic toxicity.135
more recent advances in our understanding of the molecular pharmacology of pde4 isozymes has led to the development of second-generation pde4 inhibitors that preserve
the anti-inflammatory efficacy of these agents while reducing the incidence of emesis.55,136 several of these secondgeneration pde4 inhibitors are in clinical trials. administration of cdp840 orally in a double-blinded,
placebo-controlled trial was associated with significant
ablation of the asthmatic late-phase response after allergen
challenge without significantly altering the immediate
response to histamine challenge. these data suggest an antiinflammatory mechanism of action; dose-limiting toxicity
was not seen in this study.137 oral administration of
 xxxd1697xxx  ( xxxd1697xxx ,  xxxd1697xxx ) to a population of pure asthmatics in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was
associated with clinically relevant and sustained improvements in pulmonary function parameters; once again, the
product was well tolerated.138 development of  xxxd1697xxx 
continues for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.139,140 finally, administration of  xxxd3140xxx 
significantly inhibited the late-phase asthmatic response to
antigen challenge and significantly reduced the fall in lung
function associated with exercise challenge in exerciseinduced asthma; this product was also well tolerated.141,142
several additional second-generation pde4 inhibitors are in
preclinical and early-stage clinical development.

conclusions
the past several years have witnessed significant
advances in our understanding of the molecular pharmacology of cyclic nucleotide pdes. with the advent of
second-generation pde4 inhibitors, the continued success of pde5 inhibitors, and recent advances in rational
structure/function drug design, the therapeutic promise
of selective pde inhibitors may soon be realized.
