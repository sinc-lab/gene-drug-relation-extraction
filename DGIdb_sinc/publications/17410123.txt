genotype- or age-dependent?

in vitro a-2cdel322-325 adrenoceptor (ar) polymorphism exhibits reduced functional responsiveness. we studied
whether this is true also in vivo in humans. we assessed in nine young wild-type (wt) a-2c ar subjects (aged 23 years),
10 elder wt a-2c ar subjects (aged 63 years), and nine a-2cdel ar subjects (aged 28 years) clonidine
(1 lg/kg intravenous (i.v.) bolus)-evoked plasma noradrenaline (pna), heart rate (hr), and blood pressure (bp)
changes. clonidine-evoked pna decreases were comparable in young wt a-2c and in a-2cdel ar subjects, but
significantly lower (p ¼ 0.033) in elder subjects. similarly, clonidine-evoked hr decreases were significantly larger in
young wt a-2c and in a-2cdel ar subjects than in elder subjects, whereas clonidine-evoked bp decreases were larger in
elder subjects. in conclusion, a-2cdel ar appears to play only a minor role in presynaptic regulation of na release and/
or to be not hypofunctional in vivo in humans, but functional responsiveness of presynaptic a-2 ar declines with ageing.

in the periphery, a-2 adrenoceptors (ar) evoke two major
physiologic effects: localized postsynaptically they mediate
vasoconstriction, localized presynaptically on nerve terminals
they mediate inhibition of noradrenaline (na) release evoked
by sympathetic nerve stimulation. in addition, in the central
nervous system a-2 ar are involved in an inhibitory manner
in the regulation of sympathetically mediated na release.1–3
in the last 10 years with the introduction of molecular
biology techniques into pharmacology, it has become clear
that a-2 ar has to be subdivided into the subtypes a-2a, a2b, and a-2c ar.4 studies mainly in gene-targeted mice have
revealed that these three a-2 ar subtypes differ in their
cellular and tissue distribution. now it seems to be generally
accepted that a-2a and a-2c ar are the major subtypes
involved in presynaptic regulation of sympathetically
mediated na release (for review see refs. 5 and 6).
recent studies have revealed that a-2a, a-2b, and a-2c ar
are polymorphic (for review see ref. 7). in vitro studies of
four amino-acid deletion polymorphism in the third
intracellular loop of the a-2c ar (a-2cdel322-325 ar)
showed that this is a ‘‘loss of function’’ polymorphism.
studies in chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with

a-2cdel ar showed reduced agonist-induced inhibition of
adenylyl cyclase and a rightward shift of agonist concentration–effect curves; and in agonist competition-binding
studies, a-2cdel ar displayed reduced high-affinity agonist
binding in the absence of guanine nucleotides, implying
diminished a-2 ar–g-protein interaction.8 thus, it could be
hypothesized that such a hypofunctional presynaptic a-2cdel
ar in the human heart could exhibit impaired feedback
regulation of na release and, by this, enhanced na release.
such a condition of chronic adrenergic signaling could
produce a cardiomyopathic phenotype (for review see refs. 4
and 9). in fact, small et al.10 have recently found that african
americans carrying the a-2cdel ar variant had an increased
risk for heart failure, especially if they were also carrying the
arg389 b-1 ar variant. on the other hand, two studies in
japanese11 and italian heart failure patients12 failed to find
any association between the a-2cdel ar in combination with
the arg389 b-1 ar variant and the risk of heart failure. in
addition recently, also in a rather large group of 1,121 african
americans, no association between the a-2cdel ar in
combination with the arg389 b-1 ar variant and the risk
of heart failure was found.13

we have genotyped 374 healthy subjects for the a-2cdel ar
polymorphism; the frequency for the minor a-2cdel
ar allele was f() ¼ 0.084 and for the major a-2c ar
allele it was f( þ ) ¼ 0.916. this distribution is not different
from that predicted by the hardy–weinberg-equilibrium
and it is in the range of those published for caucasians
(f() ¼ 0.04–0.13).11–13,16–18
intravenous application of clonidine (1 mg/kg) resulted in
significant decreases of systolic bp (bpsyst), diastolic bp
(bpdiast), hr and pna levels; maximal effects were reached
usually 30–60 min after drug administration.

basal pna levels were about 36% higher in a-2cdel ar
(306735 pg/ml) than in wt a-2c ar subjects (225735
pg/ml, p ¼ 0.09989), although this did not reach statistical
significance. power calculations revealed that we would have
to study 25 subjects in each group to reach for a difference of
81 pg/ml pna statistical significance with a power of 80%.
this, however, is rather difficult because the allele frequency
of the a-2cdel ar is quite low in caucasians (see present
paper and refs. 11–13 and 16–18).
clonidine evoked decreases in pna levels and hr that
were nearly identical in the wt a-2c ar and a-2cdel ar
subjects (figure 1). similarly, clonidine-induced maximal
decreases in bpsyst and bpdiast were not significantly
different between the two genotype groups (figure 1).
however, bp effects of clonidine lasted significantly longer in
the a-2cdel ar than in the wt a-2c ar subjects (figure 1
and table 1).
as our group of a-2cdel ar subjects consisted of three
homozygous a-2cdel ar and six heterozygous a-2cdel/a2c ar subjects, we additionally compared the effects of
clonidine on pna levels separately in these two genotype
groups with those in the group of wt a-2c ar subjects
(figure 2). again, there was no significant difference in
clonidine-induced decrease in pna between wt a-2c and
homozygous a-2cdel ar subjects. on the other hand, in the
group of heterozygous a-2cdel ar subjects, clonidineevoked decrease in pna tended to be larger than that in
wt a-2c ar subjects (figure 2).

basal hemodynamic parameters were comparable between
wt a-2c ar and a-2cdel ar subjects, although bpsyst and
hr were slightly higher in wt a-2c ar subjects (table 1).

in the group of elder wt a-2c ar subjects, basal bpsyst and
bpdiast were significantly higher than in the group of young
a-2c and a-2cdel ar subjects (table 1); in addition, basal

the aim of this study was to get further insight into the
functional importance of the a-2cdel ar in humans. for
this purpose, we studied in nine young healthy volunteers
(aged 23 years), 10 elder healthy volunteers (aged 63 years)
carrying the wild-type (wt) a-2c ar, and nine young
healthy volunteers (aged 28 years) carrying one (n ¼ 6) or
two alleles (n ¼ 3) of the a-2cdel ar, the effects of i.v.
clonidine on plasma na (pna) levels, as well as on heart rate
(hr) and blood pressure (bp). this procedure—known as
‘‘clonidine suppression test’’14—is frequently used for the
diagnosis of pheochromocytoma based on the fact that
clonidine acting at central and peripheral presynaptic a-2
ar2,15 suppresses sympathetically mediated na release,
whereas it does not affect na release in pheochromocytoma
that is presumed to be autonomous.

discussion

figure 2 effects of clonidine (1 mg/kg, i.v.) on pna levels in three subjects
homozygous for the a-2cdel ar, six subjects heterozygous for the
a-2c/a-2cdel ar, and in nine young subjects with the wt a-2c ar.
ordinates: changes in pna in delta pg/ml. abscissae: time after clonidine
injection in min. given are means7sem of three subjects homozygous for
the a-2cdel ar, six subjects heterozygous for the a-2c/a-2cdel ar, and nine
young subjects with the wt a-2c ar, except for time points 120 and
150 min after clonidine, where only four wt a-2c ar subjects have been
measured.

pna levels were about 15% higher than in the group of
young wt a-2c subjects (p ¼ 0.42) although this did not
reach statistical significance (table 1).
clonidine-evoked decrease in hr and pna levels were
significantly larger in the group of young vs elder wt a-2c
ar subjects (figure 3). on the other hand, the clonidineevoked decrease in bpsyst was significantly larger in the
group of elder vs young subjects (figure 3).

in this study, in healthy young and elder subjects carrying the
wt a-2c ar and in subjects carrying one or two alleles of
the a-2cdel ar, i.v. clonidine evoked significant decreases in
pna levels, hr, and bp. these hemodynamic effects of
clonidine are in good agreement with the established concept
of a sympatholytic mode of action of clonidine.2,15 the
effects of clondine were comparable in young subjects with
the wt a-2c ar and the a-2cdel ar, but clearly different
from those in elder subjects with the wt a-2c ar.
clonidine acts on a-2 ar, both in the central nervous
system and in the periphery on the presynaptic nerve
terminals.2 stimulation of these receptors causes inhibition
of sympathetically mediated neuronal na release and by
this inhibition of sympathetic nervous activity. the main
effect of clonidine appears to be in the central nervous
system,15 but activation of peripheral presynaptic a-2 ar
significantly contributes to its sympatholytic mode of
action.19 studies mainly in transgenic mice have shown that
the a-2a and a-2c ar are the main a-2 ar subtypes
localized presynaptically on sympathetic nerve terminals.5,6
in addition, it is worth noting that, in human heart, the
presynaptic a-2 ar has been subclassified as a-2c ar20
although this has been challenged (see ref. 4). thus, it
appears to be justified to conclude that, in this study, at least
part of the effects of clonidine on pna levels are mediated by
(presynaptic) a-2c ar.
recently, a four amino-acid deletion polymorphism
(amino acids 322–325) in the third intracellular loop of the
a-2c ar has been found (the a-2cdel 322–325 ar).8 stable

hamster ovary cells revealed that it showed reduced coupling
to gi protein and reduced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.8
thus, it could be speculated that such a hypofunctional
a-2cdel ar, localized presynaptically on sympathetic nerve
terminals, should cause reduced inhibition of sympathetically
mediated na release. in fact, in vivo in african americans
homozygous for the a-2cdel ar polymorphism basal total
na spillover and yohimbine-induced increases in total na
spillover were larger than in homozygous wt a-2c ar
subjects,21 indicating increased sympathetic activity in these
subjects. from these findings it was hypothesized that african
americans homozygous for the a-2cdel ar polymorphism
might develop earlier hypertension.21 in addition, small
et al.10 have recently found that african americans carrying
the a-2cdel ar variant had an increased risk for heart
failure, especially if they were also carrying the arg389 b-1
ar variant. on the other hand, li et al.,18 studying a large
population of 3,398 individuals (52% african americans),
failed to find any association between african americans
homozygous for the a-2cdel ar and hypertension or heart
failure. similarly, two recent studies in 91 japanese11 and 260
italian heart failure patients,12 as well as one study in 1,121
african americans,13 did also not find any association
between the a-2cdel ar in combination with the arg389
b-1 ar variant and the risk of heart failure.
in this study, we used the a-2 ar agonist clonidine to test
the functional responsiveness of the a-2cdel ar. we
hypothesized that if the a-2cdel ar is indeed hypofunctional, stimulation of this receptor by clonidine should result
in less reduction in pna levels than in subjects with the wt
a-2c ar. however, as shown in figure 1, the clonidine528

evoked decrease in pna levels was nearly identical in young
subjects with the a-2cdel ar and in age-matched subjects
with the wt a-2c ar.
it should be considered that in our group of a-2cdel ar
subjects, only three were homozygous a-2cdel ar, whereas
six were heterozygous a-2cdel/a-2c ar—and that could
have masked functional differences. this seems to be,
however, not the case. results were nearly identical if we
compared the effects of clonidine on pna levels in the three
subjects homozygous for a-2cdel ar separately with those in
the group of wt a-2c ar subjects (figure 2). in addition, in
the six heterozygous a-2cdel/a-2c ar subjects the clonidine-induced decrease in pna tended to be larger than in the
wt a-2c ar subjects, which is opposite to what could be
expected if the a-2cdel would be hypofunctional. similarly,
we also did not find any gender-dependent differences in
clonidine effects in the group of the a-2cdel subjects. taken
together, these results do not support the idea that the
a-2cdel ar is a hypofunctional ar as demonstrated in
vitro.8 the present results—obtained in a group of caucasians—are therefore at variance with those recently obtained
by neumeister et al.,21 who found in a group of african
americans evidence for the presence of a hypofunctional
a-2cdel ar (see above). the reason for the discrepancy
between these findings and the present results is not known.
however, it should be emphasized that in these two studies,
different ethnic groups are compared: the allele frequency of
the a-2cdel ar is rather high in african american
(0.38–0.41) indicating that it might play an important role,
whereas in caucasians it is very low (0.04–0.13)11–13,16–18 (also
see the present results).

in this study, effects of clonidine on pna, however, showed
a significant decline with age: in the group of elder wt a-2c
ar subjects the clonidine-evoked decrease in pna was
significantly less than in young wt a-2c (and a-2cdel) ar
subjects. similarly, the clonidine-induced decrease in hr was
larger in young than in elder wt a-2c ar subjects. these data
could indicate that with increasing age, the sensitivity of
(presynaptic) a-2 ar might decline. studies on age-dependent
changes in human a-2 ar have been mainly performed with
circulating platelets that contain a homogenous population of
a-2a ar.4 data, however, are controversial with some studies
finding no age-related changes in platelet a-2 ar density,
other studies finding age-related decreases in a-2 ar density
and at least one study finding an age-related increase in a-2
ar density.22–33 a few studies have tested a possible age
dependency of the effects of clonidine on pna levels, but
failed to show any age-related differences in decreases in pna
following oral application of clonidine (usually 1.5–5 mg/
kg).34–36 we do not know the reason for the discrepancy
between these and this study (age-related decline in pna
response), but it might be owing to differences in the route of
clonidine application: we applied clonidine i.v., whereas in the
other studies, clondine was applied orally.
it is worthwhile to note, however, that part of the hrdecreasing effects of clonidine is because of its ability to
increase vagal tone.2,15 previous studies from our group37,38
had shown that, in humans, with increasing age cardiac
muscarinic receptor activity declines. thus, it is well possible
that in this study the smaller clonidine-induced decrease in
hr in elder wt a-2c ar vs young wt a-2c ar (and a2cdel ar) subjects is, at least partly, because of the fact that
the responsiveness of cardiac muscarinic receptors is reduced
in the elderly.
finally, clonidine-induced maximal decrease in bpsyst was
larger in elder wt a-2c ar than in young wt a-2c (and a2cdel) ar subjects. the mechanism underlying this agedependent difference in bpsyst response to clonidine, which
has been also observed by others,35,36 is not completely
understood at present. possibly, age-dependent differences not
only in pre- but also in postsynaptic a-2 ar might be involved.
conclusion

clonidine-induced decreases in pna in subjects with the a2cdel ar polymorphism were nearly identical with those in
age-matched subjects with the wt a-2c ar.
these results are compatible with the view that the a2cdel ar appears to play only a minor role in presynaptic
regulation of na release and/or to be not hypofunctional in
vivo in humans. on the other hand, the fact that clonidineevoked decrease in pna was significantly attenuated in elder
wt a-2c ar subjects indicates that the functional responsiveness of presynaptic a-2 ar declines with ageing.
methods
for the a-2cdel ar polymorphism, 374 subjects were genotyped.
to obtain human genomic dna, 10 ml blood was drawn into tubes

containing edta, and dna was isolated with a commercial dna
isolation kit (pharmacia biotech, freiburg, germany). genotyping
of the 21 bp deletion polymorphism (del 322–325) in the a-2c
ar was performed by dna fragment analysis on an automated
capillary sequencer. a fragment comprising the polymorphic site
was polymerase chain reaction amplified using the following
primers: 50 -gacgtggagccggacgag-30 (forward) and 50 tcagcgcccccgactcag-30 (reverse). the forward primer was
fluorescently labeled with hexachloro-6-carboxy-fluorescine (hex).
polymerase chain reaction was performed in reaction volumes of
15 ml containing 6 ng dna, 0.5 u taq polymerase, 1  polymerase
chain reaction buffer, 2.5 mm deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate,
0.3 nmol of each primer, and 1.3 m betain. after denaturation at
951c for 5 min, 45 cycles of 30 s at 941c, 30 s at 641c, and 45 s at
721c were run. fragments were separated on an abi 3730 dna
analyzer (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) and subsequently
analyzed using the genemappertm software version 3.5 (applied
biosystems).
twenty-eight subjects participated in this study: nine young
healthy male subjects (age 2371 years, body mass index 2371 kg/
m2), 10 elder healthy male subjects (age 6371 years, body mass
index 2771 kg/m2) with the wt a-2c ar, and nine healthy subjects
(three females, six males, age 2871 years, body mass index
2671 kg/m2) carrying one (n ¼ 6) or two alleles (n ¼ 3) of the a2cdel ar. baseline hemodynamic and pna data are given in
table 1.
all participants of the study gave written informed consent. the
ethical committee of the university of essen medical school
approved the study protocol. all subjects were in normal health,
based on cardiovascular and other medical history, physical
examination, biochemical, hematologic, and electrocardiographic
screening. none of the subjects took any medication. all subjects
were nonsmokers. subjects were blinded for the genotype.
the investigators were aware of the genotype of the subjects as
the participants were recruited according to their genotype.
all subjects were studied in the  xxxd2476xxx  an overnight
fast and in supine position on a comfortable bed. the volunteers
were advised to avoid caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and physical
exercise before each study. room temperature was kept stable
between 24 and 261c.
subjects arrived at the clinical laboratory at 8.00 h and after
affixment of instruments an indwelling polythene catheter was
positioned in an antecubital vein for injection of clonidine and
blood sampling. after 1 h of rest, volunteers received 1 mg/kg
clonidine i.v. ( xxxd1728xxx , boehringer/ingelheim, germany) within
5 min. immediately before and every 30 min until 180 min after
clonidine injection, we assessed bpsyst and bpdiast, and hr, and
10 ml ice-cold edta blood were withdrawn for determination of
pna levels. bp was measured with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer (erkameter, richard kallmeyer, bad tölz/ germany)
and hr from electrocardiogram. pna levels were determined by a
high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorometric detection.39
all data given in text and figures are mean7sem of n
experiments. statistical differences between basal (resting) values
of bpsyst, bpdiast, hr, and pna were assessed by a two-tailed
unpaired student’s t-test (table 1). statistical differences between
basal (resting) values of bpsyst, bpdiast, hr, and pna, and
corresponding values 30, 60, 90, and 180 min after clonidine, were
assessed by a two-tailed paired student’s t-test (table 1). to test
statistical significance between time–response curves of clonidineinduced changes in bpsyst, bpdiast, hr, and pna, we performed a
two-way analysis of variance with factors time and a-2c ar
genotype with bonferroni’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons
for the comparison of young wt a-2c ar versus a-2cdel ar
subjects and a two-way analysis of variance with factors time and age
with bonferroni’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons for young
