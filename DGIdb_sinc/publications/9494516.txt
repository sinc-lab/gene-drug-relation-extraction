selective sensitization of adriamycin-resistant p388 murine leukemia cells to antineoplastic agents following transfection with human dna topoisome...  previous studies have demonstrated decreased levels of dna  xxxg2312xxx  alpha protein and messenger rna in the adriamycin-resistant p388 murine leukemia cell line p388/adr/7 compared to the sensitive p388/4 cell line. an allelic fusion event involving the  xxxg2312xxx  alpha and the  xxxd3417xxx  receptor a genes has been identified in these cells that probably contributes to the decreased  xxxg2312xxx  activity in p388/adr/7 cells. however, this allelic mutation may be a minor contributor or even incidental to the resistance phenotype, since these cells display other candidate mechanisms of resistance, including increased p-glycoprotein, increased glutathione-s-transferase activity and an increased onset of dna repair. to establish a role for  xxxg2312xxx  alpha in mediating the adriamycin resistance phenotype, complementation of the mutant allele was attempted by transfecting the murine p388/adr/7 cells with a human  xxxg2312xxx  alpha expression construct under the control of the human metallothionein iia promoter. the majority of transfected cell lines that were obtained by selection in hygromycin b contained copies of the integrated expression construct that were rearranged. only two of thirty-two transfected cell lines were found to contain a single, unrearranged copy of the human  xxxg2312xxx  alpha cdna. p388/adr/7 cell lines carrying an integrated, intact human  xxxg2312xxx  alpha expression vector were more sensitive to adriamycin,  xxxd1816xxx , mitoxantrone, and etoposide, but not to  xxxd1800xxx  and vincristine compared to control cells transfected with vector alone or cell lines with rearranged  xxxg2312xxx  alpha expression constructs. these findings suggest that  xxxg2312xxx  alpha is a selective and significant contributor to multifactorial resistance.
