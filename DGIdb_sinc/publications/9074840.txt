retinoids in dermatology

summary

since their introduction 15 years ago, retinoids have been increasingly used
for topical and systemic treatment of psoriasis and other hyperkeratotic and
parakeratotic skin disorders , keratotic genodermatoses, severe acne and acnerelated dermatose s, and also for therapy and/or chemoprevention of skin cancer
and other neoplasia . oxidative metabolites of  xxxd3105xxx  (retinol) are natural
retinoids present at low levels in the peripheral blood . synthetic retinoids are
classified into 3 generations including nonaromatic , monoaromatic and polyaromatic compounds. they are detectable in plasma 30-60 minutes after systemic
administration, and reach maximum concentrations 2 to 4 hours later. elimination
half-life is 10 to 20 hours for isotretinoin , 80 to 175 days for  xxxd2071xxx  and 2 to
4 days for trans- xxxd71xxx ; the latter, however, partially converts into  xxxd2071xxx .
retinoid concentrations in skin are rather low in contrast to subcutaneous fat
tissue .
intracellularly, retinoids interact with cytosolic proteins and specific nuclear
receptors. two classes of nuclear receptors have been suggested to mediate
retinoid activity at the molecular level, rars and rxrs. the expression of
retinoid receptors is tissue specific; skin mainly espresses rary and rxru.
retinoids affect epidermal cell growth and differentiation as well as sebaceous
gland activity and exhibit immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties .
current retinoid research targets the development of receptor-selective
retinoids for tailoring and/or improving their therapeutic profile . currently,
tretinoin is used systemically for acute promyelocytic leukaemia,  xxxd2071xxx  and
 xxxd71xxx  for psoriasis and related disorders, as well as other disorders of
keratinisation, and isotretinoin for seborrhoea , severe acne, rosacea and acneiform dermatoses. systemic retinoids are also applied for chemoprevention of
epithelial skin cancer and cutaneous t cell lymphoma. the major adverse effect
of retinoids is teratogenicity; all other adverse effects are dose-dependent and
controllable. contraception is, therefore, essential during retinoid treatment in
women of child-bearing age. clinical monitoring requires physical examination
for adverse effects every 3 to 4 weeks and proper laboratory investigations, also
including analysis of retinoid bioavailability in selected cases. topical retinoids
are rapidly developing at present and seem promising for the future; their clinical
application includes acne, aging, photodamage , precanceroses, skin cancer and
disorders of skin pigmentation. the development of receptor-specific retinoids
for topical treatment of psoriasis and/or acne may lead to interesting new compounds based on our current concepts of retinoid function.

'retinoids' is a generic term that includes both
naturally occurring molecules and also synthetic
compounds showing specific biological activities
resembling those of  xxxd3105xxx  (retinol). such compounds can exhibit their specific biological activity
without being  xxxd3105xxx  analogues chemically, i.e.
without showing 'four isoprenoid units joined in a
head-to-tail manner,' as defined by the iupac-iub

also, not all biologically active synthetic retinoids
are carried by cytosolic binding proteins such as
cellular retinol binding proteins ( xxxg1938xxx ) or cytosolie retinoid acid binding proteins (crabp), and
binding to or activation of nuclear retinoid receptors may not be a necessary precondition for their
action.

ferentiation, and a few selected compounds also
exert sebosuppressive effects. based on these major properties, the group of retinoids were introduced in 1977/78 into dermatologyl-l and broad
spectrum dermatological therapy was envisaged
for the 1980sp.4]
during the past decade, retinoids have been increasingly used (a) for treatment of hyperkeratotic
and parakeratotic skin diseases, with or without
dermal inflammation, and for a series of keratotic
genodermatoses; (b) as a standard modality for
treating severe acne and acne-related dermatoses;
and (c) for treatment and/or chemoprevention of
skin cancer and other neoplasia because of their
immunomodulating activities, and their properties
to promote differentiation and induce apoptosis,
not only in epithelial tissues. the role of retinoids
in oncology may potentially increase in the future.!5j

1.  xxxd3105xxx  (retinol), natural retinoids
and the skin
 xxxd3105xxx  and its 2 metabolic derivatives,
retinaldehyde and  xxxd3417xxx , are fat-soluble unsaturated isoprenoids necessary for growth, differentiation and maintenance of epithelial tissues , and
also for reproduction. in a reversible process,  xxxd3105xxx  is oxidised in vivo to give retinaldehyde,
which is important for vision. the normal plasma
level of  xxxd3105xxx  in humans is 0.35 to 0.75
mg/l.!61
 xxxd3417xxx  is a major oxidative metabolite of
 xxxd3105xxx , and can substitute for  xxxd3105xxx  in  xxxd3105xxx -deficient animals in growth promotion and
epithelial differentiation. however, it cannot be a
substitute in completely maintaining reproduction.
the stereoisomers  xxxd3417xxx  and 13cis- xxxd3417xxx  are normal constituents of human
serum .f' unlike the  xxxd3105xxx  esters which are
stored in the liver,  xxxd3417xxx  is not stored but is
rapidly excreted. the normal levels in human
plasma are 0.55 to 1.20 ug/l for all-trans-retinoic
acid and 0.80 to 2.40 ug/l for 13-cis-retinoic
acid.[si

endogenous retinoids are unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of common skin diseases, such as acne and psoriasis.!6.8] in contrast,
hypervitaminosis a is associated with a broad spectrum of symptoms resembling the mucocutaneous
adverse effects of oral treatment with synthetic
retinoids. in humans, 0.8 to irng or 2400 to 3000iu
of  xxxd3105xxx  is required per day (l iv = 0.3mg) .
however,  xxxd3105xxx  intoxication may occur when
daily dietary intake of  xxxd3105xxx  exceeds 18 000 to
60 000 iv/day in children and 50 000 to 100 000
iv/day in adults , given over a period of several
months .i'" with restricted liver metabolic capacity,
symptoms of intoxication may appear much earlier,
within a few months and when smaller doses are
taken (10 000 iv/day) .
hypervitaminosis a is signaled by an increase
in  xxxd3105xxx  ester levels (normal value is 5 to 8%
of  xxxd3105xxx  value) in serum. the  xxxd3105xxx  values
rarely increase. pregnant women and women of
childbearing age should not exceed an oral vitamin
a intake of 8000 to 10 000 iv/day.

it was found early on that alterations of the polyene chain may dimini sh retinoid activity. modifications and/or esterification of the carboxylic end
group are often associated with reduced toxicity
while biolog ic activity is maintained or even enhanced . sub stitutions for the ring were found to
yield less toxicity with a marked increase of the
biological activity of the molecule. in further developmental work, additional aromatic ring s were

retinoid s which are biologic ally active without
binding to retino id transport proteins and to specific nuclear recept ors may interfere with this concept.
2.2 synthetic retinoids in current use

all-trans  xxxd3417xxx  (tretinoin) was the first
retinoid to be sy nthes ised. although thi s compound is now established for topical therapy, its
systemic use did not reveal significant advantages
over  xxxd3105xxx . however, recently the drug
showed beneficial effects in acute promyelocytic
leukaemia.
 xxxd2404xxx  (isotretinoin) is an extrem ely effective drug if given system ically in severe form s of acne. it has marked sebostatic activity after oral intake but its topi cal use strongly
dimini shes or cancels out sebosuppression. compared with topi cal tretinoin, topical isotretinoin
and also retinaldehyde exhibit almo st identical biological activities, with the exception of a less pronounced irritative effect;117.18] in addition, vitamin
a palmi tate is used as an ingredient in cosmetic
preparations.
when the first monoaromatic comp ound , etret inate, was developed, a real breakthrough in the
treatment of severe psoriasis and other dermatoses
was achieved. the better ratio between therapeutic
efficacy and adverse effects resulted in its widespread clinical use. its free acid metabolite,  xxxd71xxx , was later found to be similarly effective,
with a much shorter elimination half-life (ty213) that
was advantageous for therapeutic use. the fact that
re-e sterifi cation in vivo may convert  xxxd71xxx  into
 xxxd2071xxx , however, cancelled out its major advantage when compared to its precursor. motretinide,
an ethylamide of the aromatic compound, is also
available in europe for topical treatm ent.
polyarom atic retinoids, also called arotinoids,
repr esent the third synthetic retinoid generation.
the se comp ounds have been in animal and clinical
research for 15 years, but it was onl y rece ntly that
two of them were almost simulta neously int roduced for topical treatment of acne (adapalenel l'pl

3. pharmacokinetic properties and
clinical releva nce
oral retinoids have been admini stered for the
treatment of skin disease for more than 25 years,[20]
and established preparations are available for dermatological use today. because of their teratogenic
properties, however, con siderable concern has
been raised during the past decade, requiring a better understanding of their pharmacokinetics (table
iii) and the relevance of circulating retinoid blood
concentrations.[21 -24]
3.1 absorption and distribution

the bioavailability of oral isotretinoin is approximately 25%, and can be increased by food
1.5- to 2-fold . after 30 minutes the drug is detectable in the blood , and maximum concentrations are
reached 1 to 4 hours after oral intake. in some
case s, secondary and tertiary concentration maxima con sistent with an enterohepatic circulation
may occur.
the main metabolite, 4-oxo-isotretinoin (fig. i)
is present in plasma in a 2- to 4- fold higher concentration 6 hours after a single dose, and steadystate concentrations are reached after i week. the
t!,.wof isotretinoin ranges from 10 to 20 hours while
that of its metabolites range s from ii to 50 hour s.
isotretinoin crosse s the placenta.[25.26]

the aromatic retinoid ethylester  xxxd2071xxx  is
readily hydrolysed after oral intake to its free
carboxylic acid ,  xxxd71xxx , in a cis-frans-isomeric
form . its bioavailab ility is about 40%, with large
interindividual variations, since retinoid absorption from the gut is enhanced by fat-rich food. in
plasma, most synthetic retinoids are bound to lipoprotein s; only less than 2% of  xxxd2071xxx  circulates
as free drug .
one hour after oral administration,  xxxd2071xxx ,
trans- xxxd71xxx  and  xxxd71xxx  (fig. 2) can be
detected in plasma, reaching maximal levels in 2 to
4 hours. remaining amou nts of the parent ester
compound are stored in the subcutaneous fat compartment, with slow elimi nation charac teristics and
a t y2~ of 80 to 175 days after multiple doses. the
plasma concentrations during a long term washout
period (more than 2 years) are extremely low, being
most likely therapeutically ineffective, but potentially teratogenic.f'j interestingly, overweight patients tend to have slower elimination rates, maintain higher serum concentrations, and clear
 xxxd2071xxx  later.128]
from the clinical point of view, teratogenicity is
the major issue in retinoid treatment because nearly
all known retinoid compounds will be transferred
through the placenta and be secreted in breast milk ,
as shown in animal studies.l26.29.301

treatment. similar to other retinoids, trans- xxxd71xxx 
is incompletely absorbed, with its oral bioavailability ranging from 20 to 90 %. absorption increases when the drug is administered with
food,131] and more than 99% of the absorbed drug
binds to plasma proteins.pf
trans- xxxd71xxx  and its metabolite  xxxd71xxx 
are interconverted, and the individual role of the 2
metabolites in the overall therapeutic effect has not
been fully clarified. steady-state plasma concentrations of trans- xxxd71xxx  are reached within i to 2
weeks. one month after cessation of a 2- to 7month treatment period, the residual plasma concentrations of trans- and cis- xxxd71xxx  remain below
the detection limit, and the risk for teratogenicity
appears minimi sed.p'!
3.2 metabolism and elimination

the major metabolites of isotretinoin in blood
are 4-hydroxy- and 4-oxo-isotretinoin, while several glucuronide conjugates are detectable in the
bilep 41 since there is interconversion between the
2 isomers isotretinoin and tretinoin in vivo, about
10 to 30% of the drug is metabolised via tretinoin.
excretion of isotretinoin occurs after conjugation
with the faeces or after metaboli sm with the urine .
the potential clinical activity of the isotretinoin
metabolites, including the glucuronides, is under
ongoing research .
© ad is lnte rnon onol umited. all rights reserved .

the metabolism of  xxxd2071xxx  includes its hydroly sis to trans- xxxd71xxx , isomeri sation to 13-cisacitretin, oxidation to more water- soluble  xxxd3553xxx , and conjugation to glucuronides, followed
by biliary excretion : only a small part is excreted
via the urine. pharmacological studie s indicate that
 xxxd2071xxx  may be acting as a prodrug for transacitretin , but when esterase is added to an in vitro
system the 2 compounds are equipotent.
while  xxxd2071xxx  has a t y2~ of 100 days, transacitretin has a t y2~ of only 2 to 4 days) 32] the latter
is metabolised into at least 4 compounds,135]one of
which is  xxxd71xxx .[36,371 becau se of their
polar carboxylic acid group, tran s- and 13-cisacitretin are less likely than  xxxd2071xxx  to accumulate in subcutaneous tissue. both are widely distributed and are excreted in faeces and urine.
administration of trans- xxxd71xxx  instead of
 xxxd71xxx  ate was therefore considered as a preferable
therapeutic option in psoriasis,l3s-401 based on the
assumption that a shorter period of contraception
would be advantageou s for women. however, partial in vivo conversion of trans- xxxd71xxx  into  xxxd2071xxx  has been described in vivo, and  xxxd2071xxx 
at concentrations of 5 to 100 ug/l, was recentl y
detected in patients treated with oral transacitretin)41,42] re-esterification does take place

contributing factor for the formation of  xxxd2071xxx ,
but oral intake of alcohol is not a nece ssary precondition for re-e sterification.ivv'u
3.3 epidermal transport and metabolism

epidermal concentrations of isotretinoin are
rather low,[46] and no progressive accumulation in
serum, epidermis or the subcutis has been found.
after discontinuation of therapy, isotretinoin disappears from serum and skin within 2 to 4 weeks.
it seems likely that isotretinoin therapy interferes
with the endogenous metabolism of  xxxd3105xxx  in
the skin because  xxxd3105xxx  levels increased by
about 50 % and dihydrovitarnin a levels decreased
by around 80% in some patients.l461
 xxxd2071xxx  appears in human epidermis shortly
after oral administration. therapeutic level s are
reached within 7 to 10 days, with no evidence of
accumulation even after further oral intake. the
concentrations are similar in lesional and in nonlesional skin, and also in plasma of patients with
psoriasis.
the amount of  xxxd2071xxx  and trans- xxxd71xxx  l471
has little effect on endogenous  xxxd3105xxx  metabolism in skin. when treatment is discontinued, epidermal  xxxd2071xxx  decreases rapidly, and mucocutaneous adverse effects associated with high blood
drug concentrations disappear in a few days . the
drug, however, accumulates in the subcutaneous
fat tissue, reaching levels 20 to 30 times higher than
those in the epidermis.p'f
the tissue distribution of  xxxd2071xxx  is widespread, including the adrenals and several other organs in low concentrations. interestingly, adipose
tissue contains almost exclusively  xxxd2071xxx ,
whereas in the liver trans- xxxd71xxx  predominates.
trans- xxxd71xxx  concentrations in subcutaneous fat
varied from 15 to 1437 ilg/l.147,481 relatively low
concentrations of both drugs were detected in suction blister fluid at steady-state, indicating that
only minor proportions are free to diffuse outside
the vascular space.l 421

4. mechanisms of action
although  xxxd3105xxx  is assumed to enter the cell s
by non-receptor-mediated endocytosis, the exact
mechanisms of retinoid-induced phenomena, including membrane-associated signal transduction,
need to be elucidated.l49,50] intracellularly, retin oids interact with cytosolic proteins[49.50.52] and nuclear receptors.l49,51 .53,541 they induce expression
of genes which bear specific dna sequences
recognising the retinoid/receptor complex. these
pathways have been well investigated for all-trans
 xxxd3417xxx  but they may not be valid for all
retinoids.
4.1 retinoid receptors and
gene regulation

two classe s of nuclear retinoid receptors were
suggested to mediate retinoid activity at the molecular level [ xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars) and
retinoid x receptors (rxrs], members of the steroid-thyroid hormone superfamily. they act as
ligand-dependent transcriptional factors. rars
can bind both all-trans and 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  with
high affinity , while rxrs selectively interact with
9-cis- xxxd3417xxx . in contrast,  xxxd2404xxx 
shows low affinity for rars. 14-hydroxy-retroretinol, which specifically induces lymphocyte
proliferation, does not bind to or activate retinoid
receptors.pf  xxxd71xxx  does not bind to but activates
rars, and ro 40-1349 binds to but does not activate rars.l 53j these controversial data indicate
the existence of other, unknown signalling pathways for retinoid action (table iv).
recently, rara, rar~ and rary have been
identified as being encoded by distinct genes
mapped on respective chromosomes 17q21.1, 3p24
and 12q i3.[56.581 each rar gene generates multiple isoforms. the human rxr family also includes
3 members,  xxxg1998xxx , rxr~ and rxry; their genes
are mapped on chromosomes 9q34.3 , 6p21.3 and
iq22-23, respectively,l59.601

retinoid receptors reg ulate the transcription of

both topically and systemically, but act towards
normalisation in hyperproliferative epithelia. psoriatic keratinocytes are down-regulated by retinoids. in vitro,  xxxd3417xxx  has been shown to either
stimulate or inhibit epidermal keratinocyte proliferation, depending on the growth-culture conditions.
possibly, retinoids induce and modulate the expression of growth factors and their receptors .
stimulation of keratinocyte proliferation is associated with induction of  xxxd1773xxx  (camp),  xxxg681xxx  (egf) receptor binding, protein kinase c (pkc) and
transforming growth factor (tgf)-a, while tgf~2-regulated inhibition of egf binding to its
receptor leads to down-regulation of cell
growth.l 66,67] the effect of  xxxd3417xxx  on egf
receptor binding is on a region of the egf promoter, regulated by rary.
parallel to these effects, retinoids are known to
alter terminal differentiation towards a nonkeratinising, metaplastic, mucosa-like epithelium.l68] the glycosylation pattern of normal skin
treated with  xxxd3417xxx  resembles that of a mucosal epithelium.w?' with a reduction of tonofilaments, decreased corneocyte cohesiveness, impaired function of the permeability barrier, and
increased trans epidermal water loss , thus explaining the keratolytic effect of retinoids in hyperkeratotic disorders. in contrast, oral and topical
retinoids stimulate and maintain terminal differentiation of human epidermal cells, e.g . in the psoriatic plaque.
in vitro, most markers of terminal differentiation (loricrin, transglutaminase,  xxxg1217xxx , filaggrin , keratins 1 and 10) are down-regulated by
 xxxd3417xxx  in a dose-dependent manner. keratins
19 and 13, markers of nonstratified and wet stratified epithelia, respectively, are induced by retinoic
acid.l 68.70] in contrast, natural  xxxd3417xxx  concentrations (10 - 9 to 10- 8 mol/l) restored the architecture of the ' epidermis' in the air-medium interface

neutralised the rara agonist effects. in contrast,
all retinoids induced apoptosis ofmcf7 breast car cinoma er+ cells in vitro.
4.3 effects on sebaceous gland activity
and epidermal lipids
isotretinoin is the most effective drug in reducing sebaceous gland size (up to 90%) by decreasing
proliferation of basal sebocytes and suppressing
sebum production in vivo . marked decrease of wax
esters, a small decrease of squalene and a relative
increase in cholesterol level have been detected in
skin surface lipids. oral isotretinoin has also been
shown to decrease triglyceride fraction, whereas
free sterols and total ceramides were increased in
comedonallipids.f31  xxxd3417xxx  and 9cis- xxxd3417xxx  were recently found to be less
effective than isotretinoin in sebum suppression.[73.74]
current in vitro studies have confirmed the pronounced, direct inhibitory effects of isotretinoin on
proliferation and lipid synthesis of human sebocytes in vitro,p5-771 controlling their differentiation
and antigen expression.p'" the molecular basis for
this antisebotrophic activity has not been elucidated, but the cyclohexenyl ring may be necessary
for pronounced sebum suppression. since isotretinoin has low affinity for nuclear retinoid receptors
and  xxxd3417xxx -binding proteins, it is likely
that sebosuppression is not a directly receptormediated retinoid effect. arotinoids may enhance
the antikeratinising activity when bearing a carboxylic acid end group but abolish the sebosuppressive activity in humans.

retinoids in derm atology

4.4 immunomodulatory and
anti-inflammatory properties
there is some early information concerning the
activity of retinoids on immunomodulatory dermal
processes)79-84! in a more recent in vitro study, isotretinoin,  xxxd2071xxx  and  xxxd71xxx  were shown to inhibit the proliferation of dermal microvascular
endothelial cell s, without influencing the expre ssion of human leucocyte antigen (hla)-dr and
intercellular adhesion molecule ( xxxg403xxx )-1.185]
the inhibition of angiogenesis was further
investigated in t47d cell-induced tumours (w.
bollag, personal communication). all retinoids
tested inhibited angiogenesis, independent of their
receptor selectivity, but addition of an rara antagonist neutralised the angio suppressive retinoid
effect.
retinoids are generally thought to stimulate humoral and cellular immunity, although immuneinhibitory effects have been also described. 14hydroxy-retro-retinol, a natural retinoid, was
identified to be an essential growth factor for
lymphoblastoid cells .f86) retinoids can enhance
antibody production, increasing peripheral blood t
helper cells but not natural killer cells. topically
applied tretinoin was shown to prevent langerhans
cell depletion from human epidermis due to uv
light,18?! suggesting that normalisation of langerhans cell distribution in psoriatic skin during systemic  xxxd2071xxx  treatment may be a direct retinoid
effect.
cell surface antigens oft cells and natural killer
cells have been reported to increase after retinoid
exposure in vitro. 188! interaction of retinoids and
cytokines ha s been suggested, because of the
stronger differentiation respon se of hl-60 cells to
combined tretinoin and cytokines, especially interferon (ifn)-y.f89! at the molecular level , the modulation of rara gene expression in chicken t
lymphocytes by  xxxd3105xxx  and tretinoin indicates
that antigen-specific proliferative respon ses of t
lymphocytes may be directly influenced by
tretinoin via modulation of rara expression.f 90]

5. therapeutic use
the clinical use of several retinoids is now well
establi shed[92-94] (see table v).
5.1 psoriasis and related disorders

several attempts have been made in the past to
treat psoriasis systemically, including the use of
arsenic, corticosteroids, methotrexate, psoralens,
cyclosporin and other cytotoxic drugs . the topical
and also the oral application of  xxxd3417xxx  and

the first synthetic derivatives was reported by our
group as early as 1972)95-97]
today, oral retinoid s represent the mainstream
of systemic antipsoriatic treatment, particularly in
severe pustular and erythrodermic types.  xxxd2071xxx /  xxxd71xxx  are superior to isotretinoin in their
antipsoriatic action. they are administered alone or
in combination with other modalities (mild corticosteroid s, dithranol , tar) and/or with phototherapies (uvb or puva).l93,98-100]
in plaque-type psoriasi s the lesion s slowly enlarge, flatten and gradually disappear with oral
 xxxd2071xxx / xxxd71xxx  therapy. the drugs seem appropriate both for initial treatment and for maintenance in low dosage. in pustular type s (type
zumbu sch, psoriasis inversa, acrolocali sed suppurati ve pustulosis hallopeau) it was recognised
early that oral  xxxd2071xxx / xxxd71xxx  is the treatment
of first choice,[101j including palmoplantar pustulosis[i02] as a variant.
in pityriasis rubra pilar is,[103] clinical experience has been somewhat contradictory, but overall
there is a beneficial effect, particularl y in ju venile
types of the disease. in a recent review, the early
use of oral retinoid s in this variant was seen as
offering the best available chance for clearing .fl04 ]
5. 1. 1 antipsoriatic action

the antip soriatic action of retinoids is not fully
under stood . their cutaneou s effects are rather nonspecific and, therefore , a large spectrum of disorders of keratinisation respond. it seems that the
monoaromatic retinoids of the second generation:
• reduce the proliferation rate in acanthotic epidermi s by downregulating the number of cycling cells ;
• promote terminal differentiation and filaggrin
synthesis in malpighian keratinocytes;
• regul ate desquamation of the corneocytes restoring normal transglutaminase activit y levels .
their dermal effects consist of modulation of
lymphocyte fun ctions and inhibition of neutrophilic migration. psoriatic inflammation gradually
ceases after long term oral treatment over 6 to 12
weeks. it is now well accepted that retinoids work
slowly but reliabl y in psoriasis if the dosage is core ad is inte matio nal umlted . all rig hts reserved .

rect and the patient s remain under careful supervision.
5. 1.2 dosage and interactions

the dosage required for antipsoriatic treatment
is 0.3 to 1.0 rug/kg/day  xxxd2071xxx  or  xxxd71xxx , administered in i or 2 daily doses with meals.l 105l the
gold standard remain s 0.5 to 0.6 rug/kg/day given
over a period of 6 to 12 weeks. drug absorption is
increased 2- to 5-fold, and is more consistent, if
taken with fatty foods. the initial dose level may
vary individually according to the needs of the patient, type of the disease, previou s treatment s and
concomitant drug intake .
retinoid monotherapy is preferred and is always recommended by us, because of variou s interactions of retinoids, e.g. with ketoconazole,
phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, tetrac yclines, aspirin and most likely also with other
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. no interaction of  xxxd71xxx  with  xxxd2911xxx  has been
found .l106] also, retinoid s do not interfere with oral
contraceptive efficacy.l 1071
a major advantage of retino ids in psoriasis and
disorder s of keratinisation is that they act synergistically with other common treatment s, such as topical corticosteroids, dithranol , tar and also uvai
uvb phototherapies. in combined schedules the
oral dosage of  xxxd2071xxx  or  xxxd71xxx  can be reduced
to 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg/da y, thus minim ising their adverse effects. the repuva (retinoid + puva)
technique is considered today as a most effective
treatment modality for recalcitrant severe psoriasis;[i08,i091 over 80 to 90% of all case s can be
cleared after 20 to 30 uv sessions and respon se can
be maintained on low-dose oral retinoid treatment.
the rate of relapse after withdrawal of therapy,
however, is 20 to 50% during the first 6 month s,
comparable to dithranol and uvb treatments.
also, the combination s of topical dithranol and selecti ve uv phototherapy (resup) have been
recogni sed, and are well accepted for treatment of
widespread psoriasis (table vi).

slight differences concerning efficacy (30 to 50%
complete remission of moderate to severe plaquetype psoriasis within 4 to 8 weeks; 71 to 83%
marked or complete remission after 12 weeks) and
relapse rates (46.7% vs 40.6 %, respectively) were
registered.[38,39.111]  xxxd2071xxx  concentrations may
persist in plasma after changing therapy to  xxxd71xxx )1l 2) however, the adver se effect profile of
 xxxd71xxx  appeared more pronounced at dosage levels exceeding 35 to 40 mg/kg/day. mucocutaneous
adverse effects such as xerosi s, palmoplantar desquamation and hair loss were seen at higher rates
with  xxxd71xxx  . thus, most investigators limit the
dosage of  xxxd71xxx  to :5:40 mg/day : in lamellar ichthyosis :5:25 mg/day  xxxd71xxx  was found preferable)i 13] we usually recommend admini stration of
 xxxd71xxx  in 2 daily doses to avoid maximal peaks
of absorption and, therefore , increased toxicity.
since  xxxd2809xxx  ylic acids are not stored in subcutaneous tissue but are more rapidly metaboli sed, it
was originally thought that  xxxd71xxx  would replace
 xxxd2071xxx  in clinical practice ; however, the therapeutic/toxocological profile of  xxxd2071xxx  is less
pronounced (e.g . adver se effects appear more

(see section 6.6).
5.2 other disorders of keratinisation

oral retinoid s of the first and second generation
including isotretinoin,  xxxd2071xxx  and  xxxd71xxx  are
effecti ve in several disorders of keratinisation,193,1 16-1191 since their action in promoting
keratinocytic differentiation is not specific for psoriasis.
oral retinoid s have been shown to normali se
hyperkeratotic and dyskeratotic conditions, and to
reduce scaling in severe keratotic genodermatoses.
clearing is not complete, but the overall improvement of skin appearance and function justifies their
use. darier 's disease,[1 20] ichthyo sis vulgaris, congenital ichthyosis (particularly the dry lamellar
type), various types of palmoplantar keratodermas,
and also erythrokeratodermia figurata variabilis
(mendes da costa) respond well or very well to
 xxxd71xxx  ate/ xxxd71xxx  and represent standard indications for initiating oral retinoid treatment)116,1l7,1 21]
 xxxd2071xxx  or  xxxd71xxx  can be used in these conditions, whichever is available.
isotretinoin appears inferior to the aromatic
compounds becau se its strong sebostatic action
may dry out the skin and cause physical discomfort. in most cases, treatment with a low initial dosage (0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/day ) is preferred in these
indic ations for avoiding mucocutaneous adverse
effects such as retino id dermatitis, intertriginous
maceration, oozing and also increa sed bulla formation, e.g. in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. of
course, in these disorders treatment with minimal
doses is life-long , since the geneti c disease itself
remain s intractable. therefore, teratogeni city and
bone toxicit y of oral retinoid s should be monitored
and controlled carefully in the mostly younger patient group.
other rare keratotic diseases, such as ichthyo sis
hystrix, hyperkeratotic verrucou s naevi, kerato sis
lichenoides chronic a etc., may respond to standard
oral retinoid doses to some degree , producing a
reduction of hyperkeratosis and skin smoothening.
becau se of the rarity of such entities, however,

overall experience is still restricted to a limited
number of cases . finally, in porokeratosis mibelli
of the classical type, inflammatory linear verrucous
epidermal naevi (llven), pachyonychia congenita, netherton's syndrome and monilethrix, the
retinoid effect appears to be unsatisfactory.
5.3 seborrhoea, acne and
acneiform dermatoses
5.3.1 seootmoea
systemic isotretinoin is today the regimen of
choice in severe seborrhoea, since it reduces
sebocyte lipid synthesis by 75% with daily doses
as low as 0.1 mg/kg, and by 90% with 0.3 to 0.5
mg/kg after 4 weeks. no other known agent can
influence sebum production to the same extent. in
addition, the number of proliferating sebocytes and
the size of sebaceous glands decreases by 90% of
the pretreatment values. in a recent double-blind
trial, 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  [0.3 mg/kg/day (20 mg/
day)] was inferior to isotretinoin at the same dosage in 26 healthy volunteers, who had a high sebum
excretion rate , after 4 weeks (37% sebum decrease
with 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  vs 91 % with isotretinoin).[731 in another trial involving 12 healthy volunteers, oral tretinoin [0.26 mg/kg/day (20 mg/
day)] did not affect sebum excretion rates.[741
current in vitro studies have confirmed the pronounced , direct inhibitory effects of isotretinoin on
proliferation, lipid synthesis, and differentiation of
human sebocytes,[75-771 as well as on reduction of
sebaceous gland volume .l l 22l inhibition of sebocyte proliferation and lipid synthesis were found to
be independent mechanisms of isotretinoin action.
other nonaromatic retinoids, like tretinoin and 4hydroxy-tretinoin also inhibited cell proliferation
and lipid synthesis but to a lesser extent than isotretinoin, while didehydroretinoic acid and 9-cisretinoic acid were as active as isotretinoin in suppressing proliferation of human sebocytes in
vitrop4.76.771
in contrast, the second and third generation aromatic retinoids did not significantly reduce sebum
synthesis in several clinical studies.  xxxd2071xxx  (1
mg/kg/day for 8 weeks),  xxxd71xxx  (0.3 to i mg/kg/

day for 6 weeks) and arotinoid ethylester (l ug/kg/
day for 6 weeks),[123 1esarotene (100 mg/day for 6
weeks) ,[1241and temarotene (l mg/day to 2 g/day)
for 8 to 12 weeks)1125,1261 did not reveal notable
sebosuppressive activity.  xxxd1058xxx , a very potent inhibitor of sebocyte differentiation in animal
models, was inferior to isotretinoin in a few patients tested.l 1271 these retinoids were not sebosuppressive when applied topically.
patients who have received oral isotretinoin
therapy for seborrhoea do not usually experience
relapse for months or years. however, the duration
of the antiseborrhoeic effect seems to be dose dependent. taking good tolerance into account, a dosage of 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/day over 4 weeks is sufficient to produce a sebostatic effect for at least 8
weeks after discontinuation of treatment. in our experience, 5 to 10 mg/day may be sufficient as a
maintenance sebosuppressive dosage over several
years.
5.3.2 acne

systemic administration of isotretinoin, introduced in 1979, revolutionised the treatment of severe acne.l 1281 isotretinoin is the only drug that
directly suppresses abnormal desquamation of sebaceous follicle epithelium and sebum production.
subsequently, the growth of propionibacterium
acnes is greatly diminished.
isotretinoin affects all 4 pathogenic factors for
acne, whereas oral 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  (0.3 to 1
mg/kg/day),[1291etretinate (l mg/kg/day),  xxxd71xxx 
(0.3 to 1 mg/kg/day) and arotinoid ethylester (1
ilg/kg/day),11231 esarotene (l00 mg/day),[124 1 and
temarotene (l mg/day to 2 g/day)11251 were practically inactive . the clinical course of isotretinoin
therapy shows more rapid improvement of inflammatory lesions as compared with comedones. pustules are cleared earlier than papules or nodules,
and lesions localised on the face, upper arms and
legs tend to clear more rapidly than trunk lesions.
some authors favour isotretinoin 0.5 mg/kg/
day;[1231 others advocate a higher dosage of 1
mg/kg/day.l1301a 6-month treatment course is sufficient for 99% of patients, but it has been documented that an initial dosage of 1 mg/kg/day for 3
drugs 1997 mar : 53 (3)

retinoids in dermatology

months , then reduced to 0.5 and, if possible, to 0.2
mg/kg/day for 9 additional month s will optimise
the therapeutic outcome. relapse s may occur after
a single 6-month course. a 22 to 30% relapse rate
was noted in in patients followed for 10 years after
isotretinoin i mg/kg/day (or cumulative dose> 120
mg/kg) treatment, as compared to 39 to 82% with
lower dosage treatment .f'u
today, we recommend a 12-month treatment
course of isotretinoin 0.5 to i mg/kg/day in most
cases of severe acne, with a >150 mg/kg cumulative dose. factors contributing to the need for
longer treatment include a low dosage regimen (0.1
to 0.5 mg/kg/day), presence of severe acne lesions,
extrafacial involvement and prolonged history of
the disease)1 321 higher dosages are indicated particularly for severe involvement of the chest and
back)131]
contraception is essential in women of childbearing age during isotretinoin treatment at all dosages)133.1 34] estrogens, anti androgens and their
combinations inhibit sebum product ion by 12.5 to
65%. a combination of isotretinoin with systemic
corticosteroids is initially required in acne fulminans. in contrast to the opinion that isotretinoin may
be a frequent precipitating factor, in a series of 24
patient s with acne fulminan s only 5 had received
isotretinoin before the onset of the disease.l' <"
5.3.3 rosacea and other
acne-related dermatoses

the efficacy of isotretinoin 0.4 to i mg/kg/day
for 2 to 6 months in severe or recalcitrant rosacea
has been well documented)93.1 36-1 38] marked regression of skin lesions and recession of concomitant erythema and oedema are seen within 4 to 8
weeks . the anti-inflammatory action of isotretinoin must be con sidered a a possible candidate
mechani sm for its efficacy in rosacea, since there
is no evidence for a follicular disorder and sebum
synthesis is normal.
data on long term remissions in severe rosacea
are contradictory; however, remissions of up to 2
years have been documented. the daytime use of
a sunscreen is essential. in a recent randomi sed
trial, low-do se systemic isotretinoin (10 mg/day)

reduced inflammatory papules to 30% and erythema to 60% of baseline after 16 weeks of treatment. the effect lasted at least 16 weeks after drug
withdrawal. interestingly, topical tretinoin (0.025%
cream at night) also reduced papule s to 43% and
erythema to 73% of baseline)1 36]
rhinophyma responds to systemic isotretinoin
(0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day for 3 to 6 month s), preferably
at its early inflammatory stages. improvement of
early rhinophyma probably occur s because of diminution of the sebaceous glands, while fibrotic
changes are resi stant. teleangiectasia respond s
only partially because of the recession of general
inflammation. rhinophyma treatment with isotretinoin 1 mg/kg/day for up to 18 weeks resulted in a
9 to 23% reduction of the nasal volume in 9 patients.[i37]
gram-negative folliculitis respond s well to oral
isotretinoin 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day (in individual
cases initially ~2.0 mg/kg/day) for 8 to 24 weeks,
and usually results in long term remissions. the
efficacy of isotretinoin is probably a result of a
reduction of the sebaceous gland volume, sebostasis and skin 'drying' , which impair the growth condition s of klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter ,
escheri chia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa
(gram-negative folliculitis type i), as well as proteus mirabilis (type ii).
acneiform dermatoses of the elderly, such as
sebaceou s gland hyperplasia, actinic elastosis with
comedones formation (favre-racouchot disease),
and demodex folliculitis can improve with long
term treatment with isotretinoin 2.5 to 10 mg/day.
acne necroticans (isotretinoin 1 mg/kg/day for 5
weeks)[1 39j and recalcitrant oil acne (0.5 mg/kg/
day for 12 weeks)[140] may respond to treatment,
followed by long term remission, but halogen acne
seems resisrant.u'i!'
preoperative isotretinoin treatment of inverse
acne with 0.8 to 1 mg/kg/day for at least 4 weeks ,
reducing to 0.5 to 0.7 mg/kg/day for an additional
4- to 8-week period and 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg/day as a
maintenance or postoperative treatment has been
recommended in some cases.[142j surgical intervention is required in inverse acne; isotretinoin is

by itself, with rare exceptions, insufficient to stop
the di sea se. in hidradenitis suppurative and
steatoc ystoma multiplex suppurativum, the overall
inflammation responds to isotretinoin but the noninflammatory or cystic lesions remain relati vely
uninfluenced .
5.4 retinoids in skin cancer

the exact mechanisms by which oral retinoids
act beneficially in skin neoplasia and/or prevent
skin cancer are still largely unknown, but promotion of terminal epithelial cell differentiation and
induction of apoptosis may lead to tumour regression. also, control of cell growth and cell differentiation may be mediated in part by interactions between different nuclear retinoid receptor species
and the re spective response elements of dna.
an alt ern ati ve pathway by which retinoids can
mediate signals is by interacting with the transcription factor ap -l. thi s complex of the 2 protooncogenes, c-fos and c-j un, pla ys a crucial role in
cell cycle progression.uv" recent result s indicate
that inhibition of the ap-l complex by retinoids
decreases the rate of cell proliferation .is>'
recently, we demonstrated the significance of
the sphingomyelin cycle as a growth and differentiation control mechanism in human skin) i44] thi s
mechanism leads to elevation of intracellular
ceramide levels and, as shown in haemopoietic cell
line s, ceramides may represent a new second messenger, leading to inhibition of cell growth, induction of differentiation and apoptosis.u'pl in this
context, it may be of importance to note that
 xxxd3417xxx  was shown to elevate intracellular
ceramide levels and that thi s elevation was paralleled by inhibition of cell proliferation.u'vl
5.4. 1 prevention of skin cancer

synthetic retinoids have been administered not
onl y for therapy of skin mali gnan cy, but also in
several randomised chemoprevention trial s. the
data collected suggest that topical or oral administration of synthetic retinoids has a significant effect
in reversing premalignant skin lesion s and maintaining normal differentiation ) 147.149]

successful prevention of basal cell carcinomas
and squa mo us cell carcinomas in patients with
xero derma pigmentosum has been described with
oral isotretinoinlfu and oral erret inate. u'p' isotretinoin was shown to reduce the occurrence of basal
cell carcinomas by 80% and of squamous cell carcinomas by 60% over a period of2 years.  xxxd2071xxx 
was seemingly more effective with respect to squamou s cell carcinoma prevention, with a reduction
rate of75 %.
both retinoids have also been shown to be beneficial in preventing the appearance of cutaneous
tumours in the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome;[1511 goldberg et al.[ 1521 concluded that isotretinoin 0.4 mg/kg/day is effective for chemoprevention in these patients.  xxxd2071xxx  50 mg/day
has been advocated for chemoprevention in renal
tran splant recipients with a more than 20-fold increas ed risk of developing skin cancer) 1531 tran splant recipient s show increased metastatic potential , leading to a lo-fold higher mortality rate from
skin cancer. therefore, the benefit of sys temic
retinoid therapy by  xxxd2071xxx  25 to 50 mg/day appears an importa nt improvement in managing the se
patients. recently, a combination of topical tretinoin and low-do se  xxxd2071xxx  ( 10 mg/day) has been
proposed for chernoprophylaxis.t' yt also for reducing the adverse effects of oral medication.
5.4.2 therapy of precanceroses and skin cancer

keratoses were the first skin alterations to be
treated topic ally with tretinoin .[155] treatment of
actinic keratoses, bowenoid epithelial prae cancerosis, etc. , with various retinoids seems well established today. successful chemoprevention of actinic keratoses with topical tretinoin has been
described[156] and other authors have summarised
and commented favourably on its beneficial effect.
systemic administration of  xxxd2071xxx  has been also
shown to reduce actinic keratoses by 90 % but,
overall, oral intake seemed inferior in comparison
to topi cal treatment. i' vl
good result s were obtained in the treatment of
actinic keratoses using topic al isotretinoin (0. 1%);
40 % of all facial lesions disappeared after 24
weeks ) 1521 misiewicz et aj.l159] compared a cream

retinoids in dermatology

containing arotinoid methylsulphone versus  xxxd3417xxx  in a double blind study, and found that
the arotinoid compound was more effective in actinic keratoses and produced less local adverse effects.
oralleucoplakia has been shown to be retinoidsensitive (both  xxxd2071xxx  and isotretinoin)'p6o,161]
and good therapeutic results have been achieved;
regressions between 61% (isotretinoin) and 92%
( xxxd2071xxx ) have been reported.
keratoacanthoma as a semi malignant tumour
has been described to respond in nearly all patients
under oral treatment with isotretinoin[162] or etretinatej l63] however, relapses may occur after therapy. as a rule , oral retinoids are not recommended
as first line treatment for this condition, but
postsurgical retinoid administration may prevent
relapse in multiple tumours.
basal cell carcinomas show minor response to
oral retinoid treatment, even though some flattening may occur after several weeks or months. the
retinoid effect is particularly unsatisfactory in nodular, ulcerous and/or sclerodermiform tumours
which still show infiltrative growthji64]
in contrast to the benefits of chemoprevention,
no satisfactory therapeutic results have been obtained in squamous cell carcinomas either with
 xxxd2071xxx  or with isotretinoin monotherapy. recently, however, effective combinations of isotretinoin with ifna-2a were reported in patients with
advanced squamous cell carcinomas. in a group of
34 patients, 8 complete and 14 partial remissions
(65%) were observed.1165,166] another trial with 13cis- xxxd3417xxx  (1 mg/kg/day) and ifna-2a (3 or
6 mu/day) produced benefit in 68% of the patients .1167]
5.4.3 other skin neoplasms

melanomas are not sensitive to retinoids. monotherapy with isotretinoin,  xxxd2071xxx , tretinoin l168]
and  xxxd2099xxx [169] as well as combination of isotretinoin with ifna-2a[167.1 70] have been shown to
be ineffective in melanoma. also,  xxxd3105xxx  does
not seem to prevent neoplasia if used as an adjuvant.

successful monotherapy of cutaneous t cell
lymphoma has been early reported with  xxxd2071xxx ,
isotretinoin[171.175] and also with the potent arotinoid ro 13-6298 ;[176] however, the combination of
 xxxd2071xxx  and puva appeared to be superior to
retinoid alone . jones and co-workersl-fl successfully treated patients with mycosis fungoides and
sezary syndrome with  xxxd2071xxx  (1 mg/kg/day)
and electron beam therapy (35gy), but this combination provided no additional benefit for the course
of the disease.[177] some synergistic effect was found
with the combination of retinoids and chemotherapy
in advanced mycosis fungoidesj172,173,178,179]
a new promising approach for oral treatment of
cutaneous t cell lymphoma is the combined administration of  xxxd2071xxx  and ifna-2b[18o.182] or
ifna-2a,ll83] from the results obtained it may be
concluded that ifna-2b is more effective than
ifna-2a since the respective remission rates were
77% and 53%. also, a good therapeutic effect was
seen with isotretinoin and ifna-2b (a remission
rate of 57%),l184] here again , it seems that retinoids
and ifn may act synergistically: ifns are thought
to induce increased expression of rars and, vice
versa, retinoids may increase the expression of ifn
receptors.
von roenn and coworkersl'<" reported some
beneficial effect of oral tretinoin in patients with
hiv-related kaposi's sarcoma. in a phase ii study
utilising tretinoin 100 mg/mvday they found stable
disease in 2 of their 8 patients: an increased dosage
(175 mg/rnvday) was less effective. in another preliminary study in 7 patients (tretinoin 2 mg/kg/day)
3 partial remissions and 3 stable disease courses
were obtainedjl86] possibly, systemic retinoids
may inhibit or reduce endothelial proliferation in
vivo, as they do in vitro,l85]
5,5 miscellaneous disorders

oral retinoids have been used in other dermatoses. in particular, etret inate/ xxxd71xxx  were found effective in 3 entities of different pathogenetic background:
drug s 1997 mar ; 53 (3)

orfanos et al.

374

• in lichen planus,[ 1871 including oral manifestations of lichen mucosae oris with papillomatous
and erosive/bullous lesions;
• in cutaneous variants of lupus erythematosus
(le), particularly the hyperkeratotic lesions of
chronic-discoid le;
• in lichen sclerosus et atrophicus mostly localised in the anogenital area in women (kraurosis
vulvae) .
sometimes, corticosteroids are used topically or
systemically in addition, and oral retinoids are
helpful for reducing their dose (e.g. in lichen planus, le). the beneficial effect of retinoids in these
entities underlines their immunomodulatory dermal action . prurigo nodularis may be another entity
responding well to oral retinoid treatment. the use
of oral retinoids in bullous disea ses, and also in
pyoderma vegetans , kyrle's disease etc., remains
unsatisfactory. some effect will be seen[188.1891 in
sarcoidosis or sarcoid granulomas and in granuloma annulare disseminatum, but randomised trials
or case series reports are lacking .

6. adverse reactions and tolerability
the adverse effect profile of oral retinoids is
closely associated with hypervitaminosis a.[211it
includes a characteristic mucocutaneous symptomatology, alopecia, elevation of serum triglycerides,
hyperostosis and extraskeletal calcification.
retinoids are highly teratogenic if given orally during embryogenesis.
because of these adverse effects, several contra indications for retinoid treatment should be considered and careful clinical monitoring is necessary.
oral retinoid treatment appears today strictly contraindicated in pregnancy, the lactation period and
in severe hepatic and renal dysfunction:[190.191 1
hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus and severe
osteoporosis are relative contraindications. administration of retinoids with diet or lipid lowering
agents is possible in cases of slightly increased serum lipids.l 1921 co-medication with  xxxd3105xxx  (increased toxicity), tetracyclines (cranial hypertension) and high doses of aspirin (potentiation of
mucosal damage) should be avoided.
© adls internatlonal umlted. all rights reserved .

if retinoid therapy is necessary in women of
childbearing age, pregnancy tests have to be performed before and during treatment. oral contraceptives are recommended, since the common
retinoids used do not interfere with the antiovulatory activity even after prolonged intake.l 1071 before administering the drug it is strictly recommended that the risk of foetal malformations is
explained, and information inserts should be
signed prior to treatment by women of child bearing age. despite some experimental and animal
data that retinoids may influence spermatogenesis,
no impairment of male reproductive capacity in
men has been documented. in a recent case report
it was assumed that ejaculatory failure may occur
with isotretinoin.u'<l
6.1 mucocutaneous adverse effects

the mucocutaneous adverse effects of oral
retinoid treatment are well known but are mostly
tolerable, if the drug is administered (a) in the
proper indications, (b) at the appropriate dose level, and (c) under careful monitoring by the physician .
adverse effects include skin and mucosal dryness (xerosis, cheilitis, conjunctivitis, urethritis),
skin fragility and/or stickiness, retinoid dermatitis,
palmoplantar desquamation, pruritus and hair loss.
nearly all these symptoms are dose-dependent in
incidence and severity, and are fully reversible on
reducing the daily dose or on drug withdrawal.
their incidence rates may slightly differ depending on the type of retinoid given and the initial
dose used. in our 25 years of clinical experience
with oral retinoid therapy, only severe abrupt hair
loss may require drug withdrawal in rare instances.
since the frequency of cheilitis is nearly 100%, its
appearance 2 to 3 weeks after initiation of treatment is regarded by us as a marker of sufficient
absorption. in patients receiving 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/
day with a lack of or insufficient clinical response
to therapy, and who have not experienced mucocutaneous adverse effects (non-responders), we recommend blood concentration monitoring to ensure
absorption (see section 7.2).

retinoids in dermatology

6.2 eye symptomatology and
pseudotumour cerebri

with or without conjunctivitis, eye dryne ss may
cause considerable discomfort in patients wearing
contact lense s, and require s administration of  xxxd2216xxx . hemeralopia may occur, possibly because of some interference of retinoids with ll-cisretinaldehyde formation . also , papillary oedema,
corneal abnormalities with opacities and cataract,
transient acute myopia and abnormal electroretinograms have been described with retinoid
treatment. in some instances, they may require
ophthalmological consultation.
pseudotumour cerebri was initially documented
in patients receiving higher dosages of isotretinoin
(~ i mg/kg/day), particularly in combination with
tetracyclines. no further reports were published
with  xxxd2071xxx / xxxd71xxx  in recommended dosages,
but papilloedema should be con sidered in patient s
with pre-exi sting intraocular hypertension or glaucoma.
6.3 serum lipids and liver function

hyperlipidaemia occurs more often with increased serum triglycerides (20 to 40 %) than with
chole sterol increase (10 to 30%).11 94.195] it is possible that retinoids enhance lipoprotein synthesis,
decreasing elimination of blood lipid s. they may
also slightly increase synthesis of lipid s. increased
 xxxg175xxx  and to a lesser extent increased
total apolipoprotein a under retinoid treatment
support the former hypothesis.
the influence on serum triglyceride and cholesterollevels is proportional to the dose and reverses
within 4 to 8 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. [l 96] hyperlipidaemia leads to cessation of
treatment in <5% of patients.[195] hyperlipidaemia
is likely to occur in patients with predisposing factors such as obesity, alcoholism, nicotine abuse,
diabetes mellitus, familial hyperlipidaemia, and
users of ~-blockers, contraceptives and thiazides.[93]
the greate st increase in triglycerides is associated with the very low density lipoprotein fraction

(vldl; with isotretinoin and  xxxd2071xxx ) and in
cholesterol with the low density lipoprotein (ldl)
fraction (isotretinoin) and the vldl and/or ldl
fractions ( xxxd2071xxx ), with a parallel decrea se of
the high density lipoprotein (hdl ) fraction.l 197]
hyperlipidaemia during retinoid treatment can
be partiall y managed by an appropriate diet low in
fat. a high fish oil diet was found effecti ve in partially reducing hypertriglyceridaemia (27%) and
increasing hdl cholesterol (11 %) in patients
treated with  xxxd2071xxx  or  xxxd71xxx .l 198] lipid-lowering drug s taken orally are also effective, if required.
synthetic retinoids have much less affinity for
the liver than  xxxd3105xxx . most reported retinoidinduced hepatotoxic reactions have occurred with
 xxxd2071xxx  treatment, probably becau se of its high
tissue-to-blood ratio, but isotretinoin may also be
associated with such reactions.u r" elevations of
liver enzymes have been documented in 20 to 30%
of patients usually within 0.5 to 2 months of commencing therapy, but marked alterations are infrequent.[ 196] chronic toxicity resulting from retinoid
treatment is a rare event, and long term  xxxd2071xxx 
treatment is not associated with increased liver toxicity, despite the fact that cases of biopsy-proven
hepatiti s have been docurnented. u'"!
6.4 bone changes

changes in bone formation are a well recognised, common adver se reaction seen in chronic
 xxxd3105xxx  intoxication.l 9.199,200] these changes include hyperostosis, periostosis, demineralisation ,
thinning of the bones, and premature closure of the
epiphyses. short term retinoid therapy (~2 years)
in children seems to be well tolerated. data concerning long term retinoid treatment are conflicting. recent studies of  xxxd2071xxx  treatment in large
series of children and adolescents at an initial dosage of i mglkg/day for ~ii years did not register
significant bone abnormalities,[201-203) disputing
earlier case reports which suggested chronic bone
toxicity in children.
bone abnormalities in children, particularly
premature closure of the epiphyses, are indeed asdrug s 1997 mar; 53 (3)

orfanos et a1.

376

sociated with high retinoid doses (>1 mg/kg/day),
 xxxd3105xxx  supplementation, and treatment for more
than 5 years. should bone abnormalities occur,
they may not resolve upon cessation of treatment.
in adult patients, chronic retinoid toxicity confined
to bones is commonly assumed to be caused by
isotretinoin rather than acitretinletretinate.
the effects of  xxxd71xxx  on the skeletal system
are not yet well documented; however, available
data suggest similarities to  xxxd2071xxx .u'v' in a large
prospective study, tangrea et alp 041 used very low
doses of isotretinoin (0.14 mg/kg ) compared with
placebo for 3 years in the prevention of basal cell
carcinoma. they found radiographic evidence for
significant progression of pre-existing hypero stotic anomalies (40% with isotretinoin vs 18% with
placebo ).
high-dose isotretinoin for ~2 years seems to induce skeletal hypero stoses and anterior spinal ligament calcification, similar to those seen in diffuse
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (dish). changes
occur in cervical spine more often than in the thoracic and lumbar spine. some patients have shown
extraspinal calcification (ankles, pelv is, knee s).
small asymptomatic changes can be detected as
early as after 1 year of treatment. long term  xxxd2071xxx  treatment was known to induce extra spinal
tendon and ligament calcification and dish-like
invol vement. in a further study, 5% of patients
treated with  xxxd71xxx  for 1 to 2 years presented with
bone changes. while a definite relationship between hypero stoses and cumulati ve dosage of isotretinoin could not be establi shed, they are likely
to occur at a cumulative  xxxd2071xxx  dose of
>30g.!2051
osteoporosis seems to be a toxic effect of long
term  xxxd2071xxx  but not isotretinoin therapy.12061 in
addition, bone pain and acute arthritis have been
rarely documented.!9,2071 since about 50% of patients with skeletal bone changes are asymptomatic, a single radiograph of the ankle, being the
most common site of involvement, is a reasonable
test before treatment and then repeated yearly with
long term and/or high-do se retinoid treatment. in
© ad is lnte rnoti onol umited . all rig hts reserved.

addition, growth measurements are required
children.

6.5 arthralgias and myalgias

arthralg ias and myalgias may occur in up to 2
to 5% of individuals recei ving oral retinoids >0.5
mg/kg/day, with or without calcifi cation of ligaments, their appear ance seems more common in
adolescents and young adults, particularly those
treated with isotretinoin . in some cases, severe
muscle pain and temporary disability with early
morning arthralgias were seen. occasionally, concomitant malai se and fever may occur, and increases of serum enzymes including creatine phosphokinase have been found. in some rare cases
'retinoid hyper sen sitiv ity reaction ' with myoarthralgias has been suspected.
6.6 teratogenic ity

all known biologic all y acti ve retinoids are
highly teratogenic, both in animal experiments and
in human s.!133.208- 2111their biologic al action , beneficial for skin disease, seems related to the terato genic risk, and is particularly high for women exposed to treatment during the first trimester of
pregnancy. the indiscriminate transfer of retinoid s
throu gh the placenta leads to similar concentrations of the drug and its isomers both on the maternal and the fetal sitep6l therefore, systemic teratogeni city of retinoids has rem ained the major
concern today and for future retinoid research.
the clinical pattern of abnormalities induced by
retinoids is rather characteristic, although some
similarities to other teratogenic drugs such as
methotrexate may occur. they induce:
• ens and craniofacial abnormalities with internal ear and eye malform ation s and facial dysmorphia;
• bone abnormaliti es with skeletal malformations, occasionally leading to limb defects ;
• cardiovascular disorders.
all three are major birth defect phenotypes, in
some cases with lethal outcome. in addition, general retardation, thymus hormone abnormalities,
 xxxg1885xxx  deficiency, colobomas, choadrugs 1997 mar ; 53 (3)

377

retinoids in dermatology

nal atresia, etc ., have been described. there are
some differences of malformation pattern that may
characterise the influence of  xxxd3417xxx  on the
one hand and  xxxd2071xxx / xxxd71xxx  on the other, but
these remain without major clinical relevance.
today, all known therapeutic schedules with
retinoids are regarded as potentially teratogenic.
even though topical treatment with tretinoin/isotretinoin has been previously regarded as 'safe',
recent observations after the use of  xxxd3417xxx 
have raised con siderable concernpi2-214]
after topical application of isotretinoin (0.05%)
in hairless rats the plasma concentrations of isotretinoin and its metabolites were below the detection
limitj134] nevertheless, all investigators agree today that the topical application of retinoids should
be strictly avoided during the first trimester of
pregnancy. since november 1 1994, topical application of 0.05 % tretinoin crearn/o.05% isotretinoin
gel is not permitted during the entire period of
pregnancy in germany, according to a decision of
the federal drug commission.
concerning systemic administration, it has been
known that a single oral retinoid dose of 25mg
given in pregnancy during the time period of organogenesis (4 to 6 weeks) may be associated with
embryonic malformations.t-u' whereas oral retinoids taken during late in pregnancy did not influence the embryo. despite this difference indicating
a time -related teratogenic risk,[216] all present recommendations require avoidance of any oral administration of isotretinoin,  xxxd2071xxx  or  xxxd71xxx 
over the entire period of pregnancy.
the minimal dose of circulating retinoids associated with teratogenicity is not sufficiently
known. the detection limit by using the reverse
phase high performance liquid chromatography
(hplc) technique is regarded as the major parameter, and unmeasurable concentrations of <2 ug/l
may be regarded as nonteratogenic. in this respect,
some authors have pointed out that endogenous
 xxxd3417xxx  levels may be 2 to 4 ug/l.
based on pharmacokinetic data, current guidelines include the use of contraception 1 month before initiation of oral treatment with isotretinoin
© ad is international umited. all rig hts reserved .

and  xxxd2071xxx / xxxd71xxx  and continuation of contraception for 1 to 2 months after isotretinoin and 2
years after  xxxd2071xxx / xxxd71xxx  treatmentpl 7- 219l a
negative pregnancy test is required in all young
women considered for treatment 2 weeks before
initiation of treatment and at day 2 or 3 of a normal
menstrual cycle.

7. clinical monitoring
oral retinoid treatment requires clin ical experience and regular monitoring. retinoids are not the
'easy' drug for the 'difficult' patient. initial highdose retinoid therapy may cause physical discomfort, and the large number of unde sired potential
adverse reactions to be discussed and explained
during the first consultation may limit the enthusiasm of the individual to give his/her consent for
treatment.
7.1 monitoring of clinical and
laboratory parameters

today, clinical monitoring requires physical examination every 4 weeks to manage mucocutaneous adverse effects and to ensure compliance. after
administration of isotretinoin and also  xxxd2071xxx / xxxd71xxx , elevations of blood sedimentation
rate , transaminases (alt, ast, y-glutamyl transferase), plasma urea and serum lipid levels may
occur. liver enzymes (transaminases, alkaline
phosphatase, y-glutamyl transferase), serum creatinine and blood glucose should be measured every
4 to 8 weeks . if elevations appear, the retinoid dose
given should be reduced by 50% or be interrupted.
elevations of serum lipids and, more rarely, of
cholesterol, were shown early to be occasional adverse effects of oral retinoids.112,97,188,194.220l such
elevations are more often seen in older patients,
particularly in those with familial predisposition or
other risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, heavy
smoking, hypertension, oral contraceptives and
corticosteroids. furthermore, it was shown that the
amounts of creatine kinase,  xxxg175xxx , total
cholesterol and ldl cholesterol increased significantly during therapy with isotretinoin.ui!' triglyceride and cholesterol levels have to be rnonidrugs 1997 mar ; 53 (3)

378

tored every 4 weeks over a period of 2 to 3 months
during the initial phase (12 hours after intake of
food) and later on every 8 weeks. selection of patient s and appropriate diet schedules are recommended as necessary precautions for reducing the
risk of hyperlipidaemia.
prior long term therapy with oral retinoid s, e.g.
in disorder s of keratinisation ,[93.11 7] x-rays of the
spine and the long bones should be taken, particularly in adole scents and in young adults. there are
no establi shed regulations for the time intervals of
skeletal monitoring: the decision should be taken
separately for each patient. particularly in children
and adolescents, regular radiological examinations
of the skeletal system and the epiphy seal cartilage
of tubular bone s and mea surements of general
growth are necessaryp 22]
7.2 monitoring of retinoid bioava ilability
and body storage

monitoring of retinoid blood concentrations
during and after oral retinoid therapy remains of
major importance for managing cases of nonresponders or con sidering recommendations for
pregnancy. in some patient s showing little clinical
respon se the retinoid blood concentration s have
been extremely low, and only an increase in dosage
up to 1.5 mg/kg/day was followed by target blood
concentrations and sufficient clinical responsep 23]
hplc is the method of choice for highly sensitive and selective retinoid detection and measurements.[224-226] following simultaneous extraction
with organic solvent, the compounds can be measured by normal or reverse-phase hplc, [5.227]
with a detection limit of approximately 4 ij.g/l
in plasma. using a system of column-switching
hplc the limit for measurement can be reduced to
2ij.g/l.!228]
if traces of retinoids are detected in the blood of
pregnant women , interruption of pregnancy is recommended. in a few cases, traces of  xxxd2071xxx  and
 xxxd71xxx  were detected 9 to 18 month s after drug
withdrawau217.21 9] it is assumed that plasma levels
of isotretinoin below the detection limit of 2 ij.g/l
are not teratogenic because the naturally occurring

orfanos et al.

13-cis-retin oic acid reaches levels between 1.0 and
2.21j.g/l under fasting conditions.p' in the absence
of these predictors in blood , however, the presence
of retinoid traces in tissue is not fully excluded.
when plasma concentrations of  xxxd2071xxx  are
belo w the detection limit ,  xxxd2071xxx  and 13-cisacitretin can be monitored in subcutaneous tissue.
the prevalence of detectable  xxxd2071xxx  concentra tions in subcutaneous tissue was found to be higher
(83%) than in plasma (45%), both among current
 xxxd71xxx  users and also among those who had
stopped  xxxd71xxx  therapyp 29] since traces of 13cis- xxxd71xxx  were found in fat up to 29 months after
cessation of treatment , it has been suggested that
the recommended contraception period of 2 years
should be reconsidered.

8. topical treatment with retinoids
topical application of retinoids avoids their
considerable systemic toxicit y and has led to widespread use of these compounds, especially of
tretinoin , e.g. for acne vulgaris, photodam age and
also for actinic keratoses.[230.231 ]
8.1 pharmacokinetics

topical application of tretinoin is followed by
partial isomerisation to 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  and isotretinoin , and to numerou s other metabolites within
the epiderm is.[232] approximately 80% of the drug
remain s on the skin surface, while its penetration
through both the stratum corneum and the hair follicles is vehicle dependentj233] the initial diffusion
into the intact stratum corneum occurs rapidly,
within a few minutesp34] further diffusion into the
epidermis and subsequently the dermis proceeds
more slowlyj235]
tretinoin induces the activity of cytochrome
p450  xxxd3417xxx -4-hydroxylase in the keratinocytes, which converts tretinoin to its inactive metabolite 4-hydro xy- xxxd3417xxx  p 36]
the cellular  xxxd3417xxx  binding protein-ii
( xxxg512xxx ), initially proposed to transport  xxxd3417xxx  to its nuclear receptors, is the predomin ant
form of crabp in human skin , found in both
keratino cytes and fibrobla stsj 237] topical applicadrugs 1997 mar : 53 (3)

retinoids in dermatology

tion of tretinoin up-regulates  xxxg512xxx , whose
exact function remains unclear.[2381 the facts that
highly homologous proteins are found in all animal
species and that a rare has been identified within
the promoter region of the  xxxg512xxx  gene suggest
that either  xxxg512xxx  regulates the bioavailability
of retinoids by reducing the free levels available to
bind to the specific nuclear receptors, or acts as a
co-factor in retinoid metabolism.i'<'
topical isotretinoin probably also exhibits antiinflammatory activity as it was shown to significantly inhibit the leukotriene ba-induced migration of neutrophils in 16 healthy volunteers.l'"!
interestingly, tretinoin, arotinoid methyl sulphone
and arotinoid ethyl suiphone were inactive in this
study.
 xxxd71xxx  has been detected in the skin after topical application, whereas concentrations in the skin
after a single 24-hour topical application of a saturated  xxxd71xxx -isopropylmyristate formulation
were comparable to those after systemic application in a steady-state situation.£1 391however, topical  xxxd71xxx  was practically ineffective in psoriasis
and disorders of keratinisation.
8.2 clinical applications of topical retinoids
8.2. 7 acne vulgaris

topical tretinoin and isotretinoin are effective
comedolytic agents}17·18] they normalise desquamation of the follicular epithelium, promote
drainage of preexisting comedones, and inhibit the
formation of new comedones and other lesions}240.241) the restored follicular environment
impedes the growth of p. acnes and minimises the
rupturing of comedones into surrounding tissue .
the efficacy of topical isotretinoin 0.05% gel
versus vehicle for 14 weeks was examined in a
randomised study of 268 patients with acne}i7]
isotretinoin significantly reduced the inflammatory lesions after 5 weeks and the noninflammatory
lesions after 8 weeks, compared with the vehicle.
in another double-blind randomised study involving 77 patients, isotretinoin gel was compared with
benzoyl peroxide gel 5% and vehicle.uf benzoyl
peroxide had a more rapid effect on inflammatory

lesions, but both active treatments were efficacious. a new retinoid,  xxxd77xxx , has been recently
introduced for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris, possibly showing better tolerability than
tretinoin (see section 9) .
topical retinoids are regarded today as first-line
treatment for both noninflammatory and also inflammatory forms of acne. substantial clinical improvement is apparent after 6 weeks, with maximal
improvement occurring in 3 to 4 months. long
lasting remissions can be maintained with continued application on an infrequent, but regular basis .
topical retinoids may heighten susceptibility to
sunlight, and the use of sunscreens is recommended.
since topical retinoids normalise desquamation
of the follicular epithelium and topical antibiotics
and antimicrobials inhibit p. acnes, neutrophil chemotaxis and the production of free  xxxd2154xxx , the
concomitant use of a retinoid with an antimicrobial
agent addresses 3 of the 4 pathogenic factors of
acne. combination therapies utilising retinoids and
antimicrobial/antibiotic agents should be sequential, i.e . the antimicrobial/antibiotic preparation
being applied in the morning, and the retinoid preferably administered at night.
8.2.2 phofoaging and aging

well controlled studies attest to the efficacy of
topical tretinoin and isotretinoin in improving the
features of photoaging.[242-246] retinoids induce
epidermal hyperproliferation, compaction of stratum corneum, deposition of glycosaminoglycans
in the epidermis and of collagen in the immediate
subepidermal region, and slow the rate of collagen
breakdown by reducing collagenase levels and by
promoting the production of collagenase inhibitors.£147.248) epidermal melanin is reduced because
of a decrease in the rate of melanosomes transferred from melanocytes to keratinocytes secondary to the increase in epidermal proliferation.
daily application of 0.1%  xxxd3417xxx  leads
to significant improvement of wrinkling and
hyperpigmentation in 16 weeks .[246] a 0.05%
tretinoin emollient cream applied daily for 24
weeks was also shown to be effective on fine wrindrugs 1997 mar : 53 (3)

kling, mottled hyperpigmentation, and roughness
of the skin, as compared to placebo in a doubleblind, randomised trial in 296 patients.l2431
a lower tretinoin dose, 0.025% cream, has been
recently shown to be as effective as tretinoin 0.1%,
and induced a lower degree of irritationp42) combination of 0.1 %  xxxd3417xxx  with 0.05% diflorasone diacetate cream for 16 weeks once daily
induced striking clinical improvement in wrinkling
and caused bleaching in 5 postmenopausal women
with severe photoaging changes.pt" tretinoin
0.025% was also able to substantially alter the involutional structural changes in intrinsically aged
sun-protected skin of 6 elderly women treated once
daily for 9 months.l 250)
8.2.3 disorders of pigmentation

epidermal melasma responds to topical
tretinoin, either alone or in combination with
hydroquinone and hydrocortisone, in conjunction
with a broad-spectrum sunscreen.f'u epidermal
melanin is reduced by  xxxd3417xxx  . possible mechanisms include reduction in the transfer rate of
melanosomes to keratinocytes and inhibition of
tyrosinase activity leading to reduction of melanogenesis.l2521
8.2.4 other indications

clinical trials have confirmed the beneficial effect of topical tretinoin and established the efficacy
of isotretinoin 0.1% applied twice daily for 24
weeks in the treatment of actinic keratoses.ll 58,2531
plane warts in children, especially on the face, responded well to 6-week treatment with tretinoin
0.05% once daily as shown in a randomised study
in 50 childrenp54] also, actinic cheilitis responds
well to long term treatment with tretinoin 0.1% gel
once or twice daily.(255) early stretch marks were
found to improve after tretinoin 0.1 % cream once
daily for 6 months in a double-blind, randomised,
vehicle-controlled study involving 22 patients .l256]
8.2.5 adverse effects of topical retinoids

it is well known that topical application of
retinoids causes a dose-dependent dermatitis with
erythema, peeling, dryness and pruritusp42.243,245)

treatment and diminish thereafter. although no evidence exists for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity
of topical retinoids in humans, even after continued
application over several years,l213,257,258) treatment
has to be interrupted if the patient becomes pregnant (see also section 6.6).

9. new trends and outlook
forthe future
most known retinoids initiate a series ofbiological responses by indiscriminate binding to and/or
by activation of several regulatory receptors, both
of cytosolic or nuclear localisation. nevertheless,
in spite of the tremendous increase of knowledge
on the field, it still remains unclear how transcription of activated genes influences the various
retinoid-responsive skin disorders and what the
biological significance of the receptor binding is.
retinoids do not necessarily act by influencing
nuclear receptors; it is conceivable that their therapeutic effect is mediated by cell membrane mechanisms or direct pharmacologic action . nevertheless, further development of receptor-selective
retinoid ligands could contribute to better discrimination of their activity either towards keratinising
epithelia or to the sebaceous gland, and also help
drugs 1997 mar ; 53 (3)

retinoids in dermatology

to enlarge their therapeutic window by minimising
adverse effects.
receptor-selective retinoid agonists and/or antagonists are now the subject of ongoing research,
and new, more receptor- and disease-specific retinoids may be discovered in the near future. recently, oral tretinoin (45 mg/m-zday) has been introduced for the treatment of acute promyelocytic
leukaemia. in dermatology, two new arotinoids
have been developed for topical use in skin disease,
 xxxd77xxx  and  xxxd3297xxx  (fig. 3), and more synthetic compounds may follow (table vii).
 xxxd77xxx [13 ,14,191is a new naphthoic acid arotinoid with high chemical and physical (light) stability and lipophilic properties. the drug has comedolytic and anti-inflammatory action. it does not
bind to crabp,[259] although it enhances its synthesis, and its receptor selectivity appears to be
rarp > rary » rara. the drug is topically
effective in acne and has also mild anti psoriatic
properties.pv-' in acne,  xxxd77xxx  was found in
randomised studies with 0.1 % gel preparations to
be better or at least equal to 0.025% tretinoin in
reducing total or noninflammatory lesions after 12
weeks of treatment.up' local irritation occurs,
however, in about 50% of patients, which may
limit its long term value.  xxxd77xxx  has been recently introduced in several european countries as
a topical antiacne preparation. transdermal absorption is very low and the teratogenic risk after
topical application appears minimal; however, we
do not recommend its use during pregnancy.
 xxxd3297xxx 'pl is an acetylenic retinoid of the
third generation. it is a poorly absorbed, nonisomerisable arotinoid which is rapidly metabolised to its free carboxylic acid, tazarotenic acid.
the latter binds to rarp > rary» rara, without any affinity for rxrs. it was found to normalise acanthosis with a decrease ofhyperproliferative
keratins ck 6/ck 16, decrease ecf receptor expression, restore normal expression and distribution of transglutaminase k, and increase filaggrin
synthesis in the upper psoriatic epidermis, with
low potential for systemic adverse effects. it has

mild anti-inflammatory properties but is also an

 xxxd3297xxx  has just been released in germany
and will be soon released in some other european
countries and in the usncanada as a topical antipsoriatic agent (0.05 to 0.1 % gel) . clinical responses are seen after 2 weeks, with significant
clearing after 6 to 12 weeks of treatment. combination of  xxxd3297xxx  with less potent corticosteroids may increase the overall therapeutic potential
and reduce local irritation, as shown by us at the
beginning of the retinoid era,l2031
in the future, the group of arotinoids which we
first introduced for the treatment of skin disease[260,2611appears promising for consideration as
potential anticancer drugs. better knowledge of the
retinoid-induced intracellular events is needed.
the next decade will allow further elucidation of
how retinoids work and how cell dedifferentiation
could be reversed under retinoid supervision.
