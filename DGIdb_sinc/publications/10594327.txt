abstract
we previously reported the induction of apoptotic dna fragmentation by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs žnsaids. in cultured
rat gastric cells, and indicated that prostaglandin-synthesis is only marginally involved in the apoptotic process. in the present study, we
examined whether the generation of reactive oxygen species is critically involved in nsaid-induced apoptosis. indomethacin, sodium
diclofenac,  xxxd2141xxx , zaltoprofen,  xxxd2065xxx , but not mofezolac, enhanced apoptotic dna fragmentation and mrna expression for
 xxxg1884xxx  in ags cells, a cell line derived from human gastric epithelium. the apoptotic effect of indomethacin was then
confirmed by fluorescent staining of the cells with  xxxg166xxx . apoptotic dna fragmentation induced by indomethacin and  xxxd2141xxx 
was suppressed by incubation of the cells with the anti-oxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, diphenyleneiodonium chloride, and
 xxxd68xxx . these two nsaids also enhanced release from the cells of 8-isoprostane, a nonenzymatic product by free-radicalmediated peroxidation of  xxxd208xxx . further, lucigenin chemiluminescence showed that the intracellular production of reactive
oxygen species increased in cells treated with indomethacin. the present data thus indicate a crucial association between the generation of
reactive oxygen species and nsaid-induced apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells. q 1999 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs žnsaids. suppress cellular formation of prostaglandins through inhibition of cyclooxygenase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the
biosynthesis pathway žvane, 1971.. although their favorable anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and analgesic properties have placed them in wide clinical use, their oral
administration is accompanied by a high incidence of
gastrointestinal side-effects. given that prostaglandins confer cytoprotective effects in the gastrointestinal toxicity,
this may largely result from the suppression of gastrointestinal prostaglandin synthesis žwallace, 1994; vane and
botting, 1996.. against this, however, gene disruption of
 xxxg1883xxx , a constitutive isoform normally present
in gastric tissue which possibly contributes to the production of cytoprotective prostaglandins, did not induce gas-

tric ulcers in mice žlangenbach et al., 1995.. the gastrointestinal toxicity of nsaids therefore requires further
investigation, especially with regard to the mechanisms by
which it is induced.
we recently reported the apoptotic effect of nsaids in
cultured rat gastric mucosal cells žkusuhara et al., 1998..
induction of apoptotic dna fragmentation was accompanied by enhanced expression of mrna for  xxxg1884xxx , an inducible isoform, and suppressed by caspase
inhibitors. in contrast, the apoptotic effect showed little
connection with nsaid’s inhibitory activity against  xxxg1883xxx , and was not prevented by exogenous supplementation of 16, 16-dimethyl prostaglandin  xxxd2037xxx  . nsaid-induced apoptosis is thus considered unrelated to the suppressive effect of these drugs on cellular prostaglandin
synthesis. further, the apoptotic effect of nsaids indomethacin and sodium diclofenac, with a high incidence of
gastrointestinal toxicity, was much stronger than that of
less toxic drugs, indicating that apoptotic effect of nsaids
is closely related to gastrointestinal toxicity. however, the
signaling pathway leading to apoptotic cell death remains
unclear.

apoptosis induced by anti-cancer drugs including  xxxd412xxx  and etoposide was accompanied by the generation
of reactive oxygen species in several cell lines žverhaegen
et al., 1995; shimizu et al., 1998.. generation of reactive
oxygen species was also involved in the apoptosis induced
by glycochenodeoxycholate, a hydrophobic bile salt, in
cultured hepatocytes žpatel and gores, 1997.. together,
these findings indicate that oxidative stress through the
generation of reactive oxygen species is a key mediator of
apoptosis induced by various chemicals and toxicants.
furthermore, reactive oxygen species have also been suggested to play a critical role in the receptor-mediated
apoptosis induced by transforming growth factor b1 and
 xxxg2296xxx -a žcossarizza et al., 1995; lafon et
al., 1996.. the recent discovery that the anti-apoptotic
bcl-2 gene product has anti-oxidant properties lends further
support to the importance of oxidative events in apoptosis
žhockenbery et al., 1993; kane et al., 1993.. reactive
oxygen species have thus been shown to play an essential
role in apoptotic pathways.
the purpose of the present study is to investigate
whether reactive oxygen species are also involved in the
apoptosis induced by nsaids, using six kinds of nsaids
in clinical use as test drugs and ags cells, a cell line
derived from the human gastric epithelium, as target cells
of apoptosis.

the human gastric epithelial cell line ags was obtained from the american type culture collection žrockville, md. and maintained in ham’s f12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5%
co 2 at 378c. this cell line expresses wild-type p53 and
has been widely used as a host for helicobacter pylori
infection žbarranco et al., 1983; chen et al., 1997; keates
et al., 1997; sharma et al., 1998.. the cells were seeded at
a density of 1 = 10 5 per ml of ham’s f12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and grown to confluency in six- or 96-well culture plates, or 75-cm2 culture
flasks according to experimental purpose. the cells were
then washed, immersed in ham’s f12 medium without
serum, and subjected to assay. drugs and reagents were
added to the medium at the onset of culture and maintained thereafter until the termination of incubation. final
concentration of dmso in the medium was 0.1–0.2%.
2.3. detection of apoptotic dna fragmentation
ags cells were grown in 96-well culture plates. the
cells were incubated with drugs andror reagents for 30
min or 6 h. those treated for 30 min were then washed and
further incubated for 5.5 h in serum-free ham’s f12

3.1. induction of apoptotic dna fragmentation by nsaids
in ags cells
the effect of six kinds of nsaids at concentrations
from 10 mm to 1 mm on apoptotic dna fragmentation in
ags cells is shown in fig. 1. among these, indomethacin,
sodium diclofenac, and  xxxd2141xxx  were found to significantly induce dna fragmentation within 30 min after the
onset of incubation. this fragmentation was exacerbated
when the incubation period was prolonged to 6 h. zaltoprofen and  xxxd2065xxx  caused almost no fragmentation within
30 min, but did induce moderate fragmentation on incubation for 6 h. among nsaids tested, only mofezolac
caused no significant dna fragmentation in the time
periods examined. thus, indomethacin, sodium diclofenac,
and  xxxd2141xxx  were found to be the strongest inducers of
apoptotic dna fragmentation, followed by zaltoprofen,
 xxxd2065xxx , and then mofezolac.

ags cells were incubated with or without 1 mm indomethacin for 6 h.
the cells were then collected, incubated with the fluorescein-conjugated
 xxxg166xxx  reagent for 15 min at room temperature and analyzed on a
flow cytometer. typical patterns of five preparations are shown.

3.2. induction of mrna expression for  xxxg1884xxx 
by nsaids in ags cells
expression of  xxxg1884xxx  mrna in ags cells
incubated for 6 h with nsaids is shown in fig. 2. the
mrna expression was detected in only small amounts in
the untreated cells. in contrast, significant expression was
induced by treatment with indomethacin, sodium diclofenac,  xxxd2141xxx , zaltoprofen, and  xxxd2065xxx  at a concentration of 1 mm. mofezolac had almost no effect on
this variable. expression for  xxxg1883xxx  and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mrna was constitutive, with the various drug treatments showing almost no
effect ždata not shown..
3.3. effect of indomethacin on  xxxg166xxx -binding of ags
cells
flow cytometric patterns of ags cells stained with
fluorescein-labeled  xxxg166xxx  are shown in fig. 3. incubation with indomethacin at 1 mm generated a new fluorescent peak, indicating apoptotic alteration of lipid organization in the plasma membrane. the percentage of apoptotic
cells was approximately 10–20%.

nucleotide sequence of the  xxxg1884xxx  gene. typical patterns of
agarose gel electrophoresis of the pcr products and a summary after
image analysis are shown. molecular standards are 2000, 1500, 1000,

ester did not suppress dna fragmentation, indicating that
endogenous  xxxd2738xxx  production is not involved in
nsaid-induced apoptotic dna fragmentation. catalase

mm, indicating that reactive oxygen species are generated
before the execution of apoptosis. mofezolac, with low
apoptotic dna fragmentation inducing activity, had no
effect on 8-isoprostane release.
the effect of 8-isoprostane on apoptotic dna fragmentation in ags cells is shown in fig. 5b. 8-isoprostane
hardly induced any fragmentation at concentrations up to
100 pgrml. this finding indicates that the induction of
dna fragmentation by nsaids was not mediated by
8-isoprostane per se, but rather was mediated by reactive
oxygen species, which, in turn, participated in generation
of 8-isoprostane.
3.6. effect of indomethacin on the production of reactiõe
oxygen species in ags cells
the effect of indomethacin on the production of reactive oxygen species in ags cells, as assessed with lucigenin chemiluminescence, is shown in fig. 6. chemiluminescence was significantly enhanced by incubation with
indomethacin at 1 mm. this enhancement was prevented
by co-incubation with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate at 100
mm. these results demonstrate the generation of reactive

reactive oxygen species does not participate in the apoptotic process. the caspase-3 inhibitor ac-devd-cho
suppressed dna fragmentation, and thus successfully acted
as a control inhibitor of dna fragmentation.

4. discussion
in the present study, the participation of reactive oxygen species in the apoptotic effect of nsaids was examined in cultured human gastric epithelial cells. dna fragmentation, a characteristic feature of cells undergoing
apoptotic cell death žcarson and ribeiro, 1993; williams
and smith, 1993., was significantly induced in ags cells
by incubation with indomethacin, sodium diclofenac,  xxxd2141xxx , zaltoprofen, and  xxxd2065xxx . these apoptotic effects
were incubation time- and drug concentration-dependent.
these nsaids also enhanced mrna expression for  xxxg1884xxx  in ags cells. overexpression of  xxxg1884xxx  mrna is known to occur in nsaid-induced
apoptosis in rous sarcoma virus-infected chicken embryo
fibroblasts and gastric cells žlu et al., 1995; kusuhara et
al., 1998.. mofezolac had no effect on either dna fragmentation or  xxxg1884xxx  expression. despite its potent inhibitory activity against  xxxg1883xxx  žkusuhara
et al., 1997; goto et al., 1998., the apoptotic effect of this
nsaid has also been found to be weak in rgm1 cells, a
rat gastric mucosal cell line žkusuhara et al., 1998.. the
up-regulation of  xxxg1884xxx  expression in ags cells
was thus a specific indicator of the apoptotic effect of
nsaids in the present study. in addition, the apoptotic
effect of indomethacin was further confirmed by fluorescence staining of cells with  xxxg166xxx .
apoptotic dna fragmentation induced by indomethacin
or  xxxd2141xxx  in ags cells was significantly suppressed
by various agents acting as inhibitors of reactive oxygen
species generation. among these, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a potent metal chelator, has been shown to act as an
anti-oxidant in blocking reactive oxygen species-associated
apoptosis although this reagent inhibits many enzymes and

its specificity may be low žverhaegen et al., 1995; johnson
et al., 1996; orrenius et al., 1996.. diphenyleneiodonium
chloride, an inhibitor of flavin-containing enzymes such as
nadph oxidase, has also been used to block production
of reactive oxygen species in a variety systems žpolyak et
al., 1997; shimizu et al., 1998.. in addition,  xxxd68xxx , a radical scavenger, has been shown to block
reactive oxygen species-associated apoptosis žcossarizza
et al., 1995; johnson et al., 1996; lafon et al., 1996;
shimizu et al., 1998.. the suppressive effect of these three
agents on nsaid-induced dna fragmentation indicates
the involvement of reactive oxygen species in the apoptotic process. further, exogeneously added catalase and
superoxide dismutase did not suppress dna fragmentation, indicating that this generation of reactive oxygen
species during nsaids treatment is intracellular. since
n-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester did not suppress dna
fragmentation, endogenous  xxxd2738xxx  production does
not appear to be required in nsaid-induced apoptosis, but
its involvement through peroxynitrite formation cannot be
absolutely ruled out. taken together, these pharmacological observations strongly suggest the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species during apoptosis induced
by nsaids in gastric cells.
the influence of nsaids on cellular reactive oxygen
species production was more directly evaluated using 8isoprostane release and lucigenin chemiluminescence assays. 8-isoprostane is generated from  xxxd208xxx  by
nonenzymatic and free-radical-mediated peroxidation, and
its release has been shown to be crucially associated with
reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptosis žmorrow and
roberts, 1996; patel and gores, 1997.. indomethacin and
 xxxd2141xxx , potent inducers of dna fragmentation in
ags cells, enhanced 8-isoprostane release from the cells.
conversely, mofezolac, which induces only slight fragmentation, hardly affected 8-isoprostane release. in addition, enhancement of 8-isoprostane release by indomethacin was blocked by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. the
effect of nsaids on apoptotic dna fragmentation thus
appears to be closely related to their effect on cellular
8-isoprostane release, although the effect on dna fragmentation was more sensitively exerted at lower concentrations. in our experiments, 8-isoprostane was found to have
no apoptotic effect on dna fragmentation, indicating that
the induction of dna fragmentation by nsaids is not
mediated by 8-isoprostane per se, but rather by reactive
oxygen species, which participate in the generation of
8-isoprostane. further, enhancement of 8-isoprostane release by indomethacin was not blocked by a caspase-3
inhibitor, even though this inhibitor clearly suppressed the
dna fragmentation induced by the drug. reactive oxygen
species production linked to 8-isoprostane release is thus
suggested to be caused before the execution of apoptosis
which should be suppressed by the caspase-3 inhibitor.
finally, investigation of the enhancement of reactive
oxygen species production by indomethacin in ags cells

h. kusuhara et al.r european journal of pharmacology 383 (1999) 331–337

using a lucigenin chemiluminescence assay showed that
chemiluminescence was significantly enhanced by incubation with indomethacin. moreover, this enhancement was
blocked by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. these findings
demonstrate the generation of reactive oxygen species in
ags cells under incubation with indomethacin.
in conclusion, this study is the first we are aware of to
demonstrate the apoptotic effect of nsaids in cultured
human gastric epithelial cells. this nsaid-induced apoptosis appears to be closely associated with intracellular
production of reactive oxygen species. in our experiments,
the drugs were used at relatively high concentrations but
these are the concentrations to which the gastric mucosa
would normally be exposed after oral administration of
these drugs to experimental animals and humans. the
molecular mechanisms by which nsaids induce oxidative
stress in gastric cells remains to be elucidated.
