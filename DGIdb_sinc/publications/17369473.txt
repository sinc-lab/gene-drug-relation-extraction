amp-activated protein kinase ( xxxg1830xxx ) acts as an ultrasensitive
cellular energy sensor system (15). increases in amp concentration ([amp]) result in an increase in thr172 phosphorylation
of  xxxg1830xxx -␣ and, thereby, an increase in  xxxg1830xxx  activity. we
have demonstrated that  xxxg1830xxx  activity responds to cytosolic
[amp] in the isolated rat heart (11, 12) and to the amp analog
zmp in mouse hearts treated with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside (38).
activated  xxxg1830xxx  functions to conserve atp or promote
atp generation.  xxxg1830xxx  stimulates atp synthesis in the heart
by ser79 phosphorylation of acetyl-coa carboxylase (acc),
which inhibits acc activity and, in turn, lowers malonyl-coa
formation. malonyl-coa inhibits carnitine  xxxd2832xxx  trans-

ferase 1, the primary transporter and control point for fatty
acyl-coa entry into the mitochondrion. thus lower malonylcoa results in an increase in the transport of  xxxd2154xxx  into the
mitochondrion, acceleration of ␤-oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx , and
increased generation of atp. fatty acid oxidation by  xxxg1830xxx 
increases during reperfusion after ischemia. increased fatty
acid oxidation in this setting can contribute to ischemic injury
by inhibiting glucose oxidation (9).
 xxxg1830xxx  also promotes atp generation by stimulating glucose uptake in the heart (31). increased atp synthesis resulting from  xxxg1830xxx  activity in skeletal muscle also appears to
include an increase in glucose uptake (14, 20).
metformin (n,n-dimethyl biguanide), which is used in the
treatment of type 2 diabetes, decreases hepatic glucose production via gluconeogenesis and increases peripheral glucose
utilization (1). in insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant adult
cardiomyocytes, the relationship between  xxxg1830xxx  activation
and glucose uptake stimulation by biguanide has been reported
(4). in the absence of insulin, biguanides restored stimulation
of glucose uptake in insulin-resistant cardiomyocytes via an
additive activation of  xxxg1830xxx  and  xxxg118xxx   xxxg1890xxx . treatment
of cardiomyocytes with metformin for 18 h increased glucose
transport by increasing the residence time of glut4 in the
plasma membrane due to an  xxxg1830xxx -dependent reduction in
endocytosis (37). metformin also decreases fatty acid oxidation by 10 –20% (30). use of  xxxd2903xxx  (n-phenylethyl
biguanide), a more lipophilic biguanide, by humans has been
discontinued because of frequent occurrence of lactic acidosis (1).
zhou et al. (39) reported that  xxxg1830xxx  is a target for metformin in hepatocytes and skeletal muscle. subsequent studies
have shown that metformin activates  xxxg1830xxx  in cardiomyocytes (7), skeletal muscle (28), and heart and aorta (40). other
studies have shown that  xxxd2903xxx  activates  xxxg1830xxx  in pancreatic islets (25) and transfected hela cells (16).
the mechanism by which the biguanides increase  xxxg1830xxx 
activity remains uncertain. fryer et al. (13) showed in muscle
cells that metformin activated  xxxg1830xxx  in the absence of any
increase in the amp-to-atp ratio (amp/atp) (13). hawley
et al. (17) reported that metformin increased  xxxg1830xxx  activity in
the absence of an increased amp/atp in chinese hamster
ovary fibroblasts and rat hepatoma cells.
this study tested the hypothesis that  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin activate  xxxg1830xxx  by increasing cytosolic [amp] in the
perfused heart. treatment of rats with perfusate containing
 xxxd2903xxx  or metformin increased  xxxg1830xxx  activity and thr172

( xxxg1830xxx ) acts as a cellular energy sensor: it responds to an increase in
amp concentration ([amp]) or the amp-to-atp ratio (amp/atp).
metformin and  xxxd2903xxx , which are biguanides, have been reported
to increase  xxxg1830xxx  activity without increasing amp/atp. this study
tests the hypothesis that these biguanides increase  xxxg1830xxx  activity in
the heart by increasing cytosolic [amp]. groups of isolated rat hearts
(n ⫽ 5–7 each) were perfused with krebs-henseleit buffer with or
without 0.2 mm  xxxd2903xxx  or 10 mm metformin, and 31p-nmrmeasured phosphocreatine, atp, and intracellular ph were used to
calculate cytosolic [amp]. at various times, hearts were freezeclamped and assayed for  xxxg1830xxx  activity, phosphorylation of thr172
on  xxxg1830xxx -␣, and phosphorylation of ser79 on acetyl-coa carboxylase, an  xxxg1830xxx  target. in hearts treated with  xxxd2903xxx  for 18 min
and then perfused for 20 min with krebs-henseleit buffer, [amp]
began to increase at 26 min and  xxxg1830xxx  activity was elevated at 36
min. in hearts treated with metformin, [amp] was increased at 50 min
and  xxxg1830xxx  activity, phosphorylated  xxxg1830xxx , and phosphorylated
acetyl-coa carboxylase were elevated at 61 min. in metformintreated hearts, hplc-measured total amp content and total amp/
atp did not increase. in summary,  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin increase  xxxg1830xxx  activity and phosphorylation in the isolated heart. the
increase in  xxxg1830xxx  activity was always preceded by and correlated
with increased cytosolic [amp]. total amp content and total amp/
atp did not change. cytosolic [amp] reported metabolically active
amp, which triggered increased  xxxg1830xxx  activity, but measures of total
amp did not.

cr concentration ([cr]) is calculated as the difference between pcr
content and total cr content (3). the 31p-nmr-measured phi was
used to estimate [h⫹]. the near equilibrium of the adenylate kinase
reaction (2adp 7 amp ⫹ atp) converts increased cytosolic [adp]
to an increase in cytosolic [amp]. thus cytosolic [amp] is set by the
adenylate kinase equilibrium expression using a keq of 1.05 (23)

study design and experimental protocols
all rat hearts were paced at 300 beats/min. in the  xxxd2903xxx 
experiments, all hearts were perfused with kh during a 12-min
baseline period. seven groups were created by alteration of the
perfusion conditions as follows for the remainder of the protocol:
1) perfusion with kh for 38 min (kh, n ⫽ 6); 2) perfusion with kh ⫹
0.2 mm  xxxd2903xxx  for 18 min (phen, n ⫽ 5); 3) perfusion with
kh ⫹ 0.2 mm  xxxd2903xxx  for 18 min followed by kh for 20 min
(phen-kh, n ⫽ 6); 4) perfusion with kh ⫹ 0.04 mm  xxxd2903xxx  for
18 min followed by kh for 20 min (phen 0.04-kh, n ⫽ 5);
5) perfusion with kh ⫹ 0.2 mm  xxxd2903xxx  for 38 min (phen 38, n ⫽
3); 6) perfusion with kh ⫹ 0.2 mm  xxxd2903xxx  for 38 min followed
by kh for 20 min (phen 38-kh, n ⫽ 1); and 7) perfusion with kh ⫹
25 mm kcl ⫹ 0.2 mm  xxxd2903xxx  for 60 min (phen-kcl 60, n ⫽ 4).
in the metformin experiments, hearts were perfused with kh during
a 12-min baseline period. four groups of hearts were created by
alteration of the perfusion conditions as follows for the remainder of
the protocol: 1) perfusion with kh for 61 min (kh, n ⫽ 5);
2) perfusion with kh ⫹ 10 mm metformin for 53 min (met 53, n ⫽
5); 3) perfusion with kh ⫹ 10 mm metformin for 61 min (met 61,
n ⫽ 5); and 4) perfusion with kh ⫹ 10 mm metformin for 83 min
(met 83, n ⫽ 3). two additional groups of hearts were perfused for
measurement of total adenine nucleotide by hplc, as well as cytosolic [amp] and  xxxg1830xxx  activity: 1) perfusion with kh (n ⫽ 8) for 26
min and 2) perfusion with kh ⫹ 10 mm metformin for 70 min
(n ⫽ 12). at the end of the protocol, hearts were freeze-clamped with
wollenberger tongs cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at ⫺80°c
until further measurements. freeze-clamping occurred 1 min after
removal from the magnet, which was 3 min from the midpoint of the
final 31p-nmr spectrum.

p-nmr spectroscopy of isolated perfused hearts. 31p-nmr free
induction decays (fids) were acquired at 161.8 mhz using a spectrometer (inova, varian, palo alto, ca). for heart 31p spectra, 96
fids were averaged over 4 min using 60° pulses and a recycle time of
2.5 s. the resonance areas of phosphocreatine (pcr) and atp and the
chemical shifts of pi were quantified using bayesian analysis software
(g. l. bretthorst, washington university, st. louis, mo), which uses
a direct statistical analysis of the time-domain data (fid) based on
bayesian probability theory (6). saturation factors for resonances
were determined from fully relaxed spectra; recycle time was 15 s.
heart 31p metabolite content. atp was used as an internal standard
to derive the concentrations of the 31p-nmr-visible metabolites of
hearts: the average of the area of the ␤-resonance of atp during the

hplc analysis. methods described by lazzarino et al. (24) were
used to measure adenine nucleotide (atp, adp, and amp) contents
(nmol/mg protein) in the extracts of freeze-clamped hearts. protein
was determined using the method of lowry et al. (26).
measurement of amp-activated protein kinase activity. total
 xxxg1830xxx  activity was measured using the method of dagher et al. (8)
modified by frederich et al. (12).  xxxg1830xxx  activity was quantified in the
resuspended pellet as incorporation of 32p from [␥-32p]atp (10
gbq/mmol; nen, boston, ma) into a synthetic peptide with the
specific target sequence for  xxxg1830xxx , the sams peptide (hmrsamsglhlvkrr, american peptides, sunnyvale, ca). radioactivity was
measured using a liquid scintillation counter (tri-carb 2100tr,
packard biosciences, meriden, ct). protein content in the solution
containing the resupended (nh4)2so4 pellet was determined using the
bradford method (5).
measurement of phosphorylation of  xxxg1830xxx -␣ at thr172 and acc at
ser79. phosphorylation was measured using western immunoblots as
described by frederich et al. (12). membranes were incubated with an
anti-phosphorylated  xxxg1830xxx -␣ polyclonal antibody (thr172; cell signaling technology, beverly, ma) or an anti-phosphorylated acc
polyclonal antibody (ser79; upstate biotechnology, lake placid, ny)
overnight at 4°c and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody (southern biotech, birmingham, al) for 2 h at
room temperature. signal detection was facilitated with lumiglo
reagent and peroxide (cell signaling technology). the membrane
immunosignals were quantitated using an image-scanning densitometer (model gs-700 imaging densitometer and quantity one version
4.2.1, bio-rad).
statistical analysis
values are means (sd). statistical computations were performed
with statistica (version 6.1, statsoft, tulsa, ok). anova was used
to compare measurements among all groups. for the 31p-nmr measurements of pcr, atp, and amp, a repeated-measures anova was
used for within-group analysis. fisher’s post hoc protected least
significant difference was used for comparison of the means. differences were declared statistically significant if p ⬍ 0.05. prism for
windows (version 4.0, graphpad software, san diego, ca) was used
for graphs.

hearts of male sprague-dawley rats (280 –320 g) were isolated and
perfused in the isovolumic langendorff model. krebs-henseleit
buffer (kh; in mm: 118 nacl, 5.9 kcl, 1.2  xxxd2534xxx , 25 nahco3,
1.75 cacl2, 0.5 na-edta, 10 d-glucose, and 0.5 pyruvate) was
equilibrated with 95% o2-5% co2 to achieve ph 7.4.  xxxd2903xxx 
(sigma-aldrich) and metformin (sigma-aldrich) were added to kh.
a pressure transducer connected to a latex balloon in the left
ventricle (lv) was used to monitor heart function, i.e., lv pressure
and heart rate (hr). lv pressure and hr were recorded using a
maclab system (adinstruments, colorado springs, co).
the experimental protocols were approved by the harvard medical
area standing committee on animals and followed the recommendations of the national institutes of health and the american physiological society’s guiding principles in the care and use of animals.

baseline period for each heart was set to 10.8 mm (2), and the areas
of other resonances, corrected for variable saturation, were calculated
on this basis. intracellular ph (phi) was calculated from the chemical
shift of intracellular pi (3). metabolite measurements are an average of
the 4 min of the 31p-nmr data acquisition, with the midpoint of the
spectrum reported as the measurement time.
calculation of cytosolic amp. 31p-nmr measurements of pcr
concentration ([pcr]), atp concentration ([atp]), and h⫹ concentration ([h⫹]) were entered into the creatine (cr) kinase reaction

cytosolic adp concentration ([adp]) using an equilibrium constant
(keq) of 1.66 ⫻ 109 m⫺1 (23)

metformin activates  xxxg1830xxx  by increasing cytosolic [amp]
results

study design and experimental protocols
the experimental protocols of this study were designed to
test the hypothesis that  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin activate
 xxxg1830xxx  by increasing cytosolic [amp] in the perfused heart.
consequently, the main protocols that treat hearts with  xxxd2903xxx  (see fig. 2) and metformin (see fig. 3) were designed
to identify the threshold increases in  xxxg1830xxx  activity during
measurement of cytosolic [amp].
hemodynamics of rat hearts perfused with  xxxd2903xxx 
and metformin

of  xxxd2903xxx  on myocardial function (fig. 1a) preceded
changes in pcr or amp (fig. 2, a and c).
to examine the concentration dependence of  xxxd2903xxx ’s
effects on the heart, another group of hearts was treated with
0.04 mm  xxxd2903xxx  for 18 min and perfused with kh for an
additional 20 min. [amp],  xxxg1830xxx  activity, phosphorylated
 xxxg1830xxx , and phosphorylated acc were unchanged (data not
shown), but sp declined to 66% of baseline, edp to 70% of
baseline, and cf to 87% of baseline (data not shown). thus a
fivefold reduction of  xxxd2903xxx  concentration alters heart
function but does not increase [amp].
hearts were also perfused with kh containing 25 mm kcl
(kh-kcl), which arrests contraction and effectively silences
the functional effect of  xxxd2903xxx  and also reduces atp
demand. these hearts were treated with 0.2 mm  xxxd2903xxx 
(phen-kh-kcl, n ⫽ 5) and compared with hearts perfused
with kh-kcl (n ⫽ 5). beginning at 42 min, cytosolic [amp]
increased in phen-kh-kcl hearts compared with their own
baseline or kh-kcl hearts; no difference was observed in the
cf of the phen-kh-kcl hearts (not shown).

at 6 min after perfusion was switched to kh containing
 xxxd2903xxx , the lv systolic pressure (sp) and coronary flow
(cf) began to decrease (fig. 1, a and b). end-diastolic pressure (edp) of the  xxxd2903xxx -treated hearts decreased transiently near the end of the treatment period. by the end of
 xxxd2903xxx  treatment, sp had declined to 45% of baseline, cf
to ⬃80% of baseline, and edp to ⬃69% of baseline. the effect

the effect of  xxxd2903xxx  on myocardial function is quite
rapid and precedes its effect on metabolism. the effect on
myocardial function also occurs at a lower  xxxd2903xxx  concentration than the metabolic effect. finally, the increase in
[amp] and  xxxg1830xxx  activity in the  xxxd2903xxx -treated k⫹arrested heart occurred without changes in cf. taken together,
these results suggest that the effects of  xxxd2903xxx  on function
and metabolism are independent.
the functional response of hearts perfused with kh ⫹ 10
mm metformin was quite different from that of phenformintreated hearts. sp, edp, and cf were unchanged during the
first 46 min of the treatment period (fig. 1, c and d). at 50
min, sp and cf increased, while edp was unchanged. these
changes in lvsp and cf occur concomitantly with the increase in cytosolic [amp] (fig. 3c). these data demonstrate
that sp was not compromised in metformin-treated hearts,
even with substantial decreases in [pcr] and increases in
cytosolic [amp]. the increase in cf may result from the
elevated [amp], which will result in increased adenosine
production (19) and vasodilation (22).

but was only different from that in kh-perfused hearts at several
time points (fig. 3b). cytosolic [amp] in metformin-perfused

treated with  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin under conditions that
surpass the threshold increase in  xxxg1830xxx  activity are included
as well.
discussion

the cause of increased  xxxg1830xxx  activity resulting from  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin exposure has not been defined. there
are two known pathways for  xxxg1830xxx  regulation in mammalian
cells. the first and best defined pathway involves increased
amp binding to the cystathione ␤-synthase domains of
 xxxg1830xxx -␥. this increases thr172 phosphorylation of  xxxg1830xxx -␣
by  xxxg1830xxx  kinase, which is required for increased  xxxg1830xxx 
activity. in the heart,  xxxg2218xxx  is the  xxxg1830xxx  kinase that phosphorylates  xxxg1830xxx -␣2, but not  xxxg1830xxx -␣1, heterotrimers during

metformin activates  xxxg1830xxx  by increasing cytosolic [amp]

ischemia and hypoxia, both of which increase amp (32). we
have demonstrated in the isolated rat heart that  xxxg1830xxx  activity
responds to cytosolic [amp] (11), but in a cytosolic [amp]independent manner to hypoxia (12). the pathway for regulation by  xxxg2218xxx  after an increase in [amp] corresponds to the
cellular energy sensor function of  xxxg1830xxx . the second pathway
for  xxxg1830xxx  regulation is directed by ca2⫹/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (camkk) activity (18, 21, 35).
camkk also phosphorylates  xxxg1830xxx -␣ at thr172. amp binding to  xxxg1830xxx  is not required. camkk activity increases in
response to increased ca2⫹. this pathway for  xxxg1830xxx  regulation by camkk, which is dependent on intracellular ca2⫹,
corresponds to a metabolic regulation function for  xxxg1830xxx  at
the organism level (34).
a third  xxxg1830xxx  kinase has been postulated and may indicate
a third pathway for  xxxg1830xxx  regulation. tgf-␤-activated kiajp-heart circ physiol • vol

nase-1 (tak1) has been reported to function as an  xxxg1830xxx 
kinase in yeast and hela cells (27). in cultured fibroblasts,
tak1 was activated by a number of stimuli, including metformin, that are known to increase  xxxg1830xxx  activity (36). loss of
tak1 prevented the increase in thr172 phosphorylation of
 xxxg1830xxx -␣ induced by metformin and interfered with activation
of  xxxg2218xxx . these results suggest that tak1 increases  xxxg2218xxx 
activity and does not directly phosphorylate  xxxg1830xxx . it appears
that tak1 modulates the  xxxg1830xxx  energy sensor pathway.
all studies that have attempted to define the regulation of
 xxxg1830xxx  activity by  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin have measured
total amp content or the ratio of total amp content to total
atp content (total amp/atp). in muscle cells (13) and
chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts and rat hepatoma cells (17),
metformin activated  xxxg1830xxx  in the absence of any increase in
amp/atp. there are a few exceptions to these reports. in

human skeletal muscle, atp and pcr content decreased with
chronic metformin administration (28). decreases in pcr typically result in increased amp. high concentrations of  xxxd2903xxx  (1–5 mm) increased amp/atp in rat brain slices (18).
in the heart, total amp content is much greater than cytosolic amp content. for example, conversion of hplc-measured total amp content of the well-perfused rat heart to
[amp] would result in ⬃350 ␮m amp; yet 31p-nmr-estimated cytosolic [amp] is ⬃0.4 ␮m. cytosolic [amp] is
estimated from measured [pcr], [atp], and phi: the creatine
kinase equilibrium expression (eq. 1) is used to calculate
cytosolic [adp], and cytosolic [adp] and measured [atp]
are used to calculate cytosolic [amp] using the adenylate
kinase equilibrium expression (eq. 2). these calculations are
valid, because the creatine kinase and adenylate kinase reactions are in states of near equilibrium in vivo and both enzymes
are abundant. cytosolic [adp] and [amp] represent the metajp-heart circ physiol • vol

abolically active fractions of the total content of these two
nucleotides. hence,  xxxg1830xxx  detects cytosolic [amp], not total
amp or total amp/atp.
to test this prediction, cytosolic [amp] and total amp were
measured (fig. 7) in metformin-treated and kh-perfused
hearts. cytosolic [amp] and  xxxg1830xxx  activity were increased in
the metformin-treated hearts. total amp and total amp/atp
were not different between the metformin-treated and khperfused hearts. thus total [amp] and total amp/atp did not
correlate with  xxxg1830xxx  activity, whereas cytosolic [amp] correlated with increased  xxxg1830xxx  activity.
in the heart, acute decreases in [pcr] typically indicate a
reduction in atp synthesis (imbalance of synthesis and use).
the decreased [pcr] and increased cytosolic [amp] are consistent with biguanides acting as metabolic inhibitors. owen
et al. (29) reported that metformin inhibited complex 1 of the
respiratory chain in liver mitochondria. el-mir et al. (10) also

patible with those used in many in vitro studies to increase
 xxxg1830xxx  activity. oral metformin is widely used to treat type 2
diabetes. in vivo metformin concentrations reported in human
plasma are ⬃10 ␮m (1). thus the results of this study may not
necessarily extrapolate to metformin’s effect on [amp]
in vivo. shaw et al. (33) reported, however, that  xxxg1830xxx 
phosphorylation was increased in livers from wild-type mice
injected with metformin, but not in livers deficient in  xxxg2218xxx .
liver  xxxg2218xxx  was also necessary for the blood glucose-lowering
effect of metformin. since  xxxg2218xxx  is required for thr172 phosphorylation of  xxxg1830xxx -␣ resulting from increased [amp] (see
above), the results of shaw et al. are consistent with the
concept that metformin increases  xxxg1830xxx  activity in vivo by
increasing [amp].
this study demonstrates in the perfused heart that the increase in  xxxg1830xxx  activity caused by  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin
results from an increase in cytosolic [amp]. metformin did not
alter total amp content or total amp/atp. the failure to
detect biguanide-induced changes in total amp content or total
amp/atp results from the insensitivity of these measures,
which do not quantify the metabolically active cytosolic
[amp] that is detected by  xxxg1830xxx .
