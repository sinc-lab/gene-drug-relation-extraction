abstract pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate (plp) stimulation of
erythrocyte alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ealt,
east) activities is a frequently used functional measure of
 xxxd2716xxx -6 status. stability of enzyme activities and activity coefficients (ac, stimulated ⴜ unstimulated) was assessed in packed erythrocytes frozen at ⴚ20, ⴚ80°c and
under liquid nitrogen (ⴚ196°c). activities of ealt and
east, with and without added plp, were determined in
fresh erythrocytes (d 0) and frozen samples on d 1, 7, 14, 28,
58 and 84. in ⴚ20°c samples, ealt basal activity decreased 17 and 22% (p ≤ 0.05 for both) by d 58 and 84,
respectively, and east basal activity decreased 40% (p
≤ 0.05) by d 58. in ⴚ80 and ⴚ196°c samples, ealt and
east basal activities did not change significantly. activity
coefficients did not differ significantly from d 0 at any storage temperature, but east-ac increased 9 –19% (nonsignificant) in samples stored at ⴚ20 and ⴚ80°c for 7 to 84 d.
additionally, east-ac was significantly higher in ⴚ20 than
ⴚ80 and ⴚ196°c samples on d 1 and 58, respectively.
erythrocytes may be frozen for 28 d at ⴚ20°c and 84 d at
ⴚ80°c before analysis for ealt; for east, activity should
be measured on fresh erythrocytes. j. nutr. 131: 1581–1583,

5⬘-phosphate (plp) (1– 4). these indicators are considered
long-term measures of  xxxd2716xxx -6 status because of the length
of the erythrocyte’s lifespan. the specific tests employed are
measurement of the basal activity of these aminotransferases
and the ratio of activity in the presence of excess plp to the
basal activity (activity coefficient; ac).
according to recent studies in women, ealt and east
activities (ac or percentage of stimulation) are sensitive
measurements related to  xxxd2716xxx -6 intake (1,2), although
ealt is considered to be more sensitive to changes in intake
(1,5). huang et al. (2), however, recently reported that east
activity responded more readily to changes in  xxxd2716xxx -6
intake than did ealt activity. several researchers (2,6,7)
have suggested that ealt and east analyses be conducted
the same day that blood is drawn to prevent possible loss of
activity due to freezing. however, no detailed studies pertaining to stability are available in the literature, despite the fact
that such information is important when laboratory determinations must be delayed or a large number of samples analyzed.
thus, the stability of enzyme activities with frozen storage is
important to consider.
in the present study, the stability of ealt and east
activities was assessed in erythrocytes from three individuals
frozen at different temperatures for varying periods of time
ranging from 1 to 84 d. in particular, the usefulness of storage
in ordinary and low temperature freezers (⫺20 and ⫺80°c)
was investigated.

subject selection. three healthy subjects (1 man, 2 women)
between the ages of 24 and 52 y, who were nonsmokers and not using
oral contraceptives, participated in this study. subjects were screened
for history of intestinal, renal or metabolic disorders that could affect
absorption, excretion or metabolism of  xxxd2716xxx -6 (8). the study
protocol was approved by the human subjects institutional review
board of washington state university and informed consent was
obtained from each subject.
sample collection and storage. blood samples (60 ml) were
taken from fasting subjects by venipuncture at the beginning of the
study. blood specimens were collected in heparinized vacutainer
tubes (becton dickinson, rutherford, nj). samples were centrifuged
at 1700 ⫻ g for 10 min at 4°c. plasma was separated from erythrocytes and the buffy coat discarded. erythrocytes were washed three
times with normal saline. the erythrocytes from each subject were
then separately pooled in 100-ml beakers in an ice slurry, gently
mixed, divided into aliquots and stored frozen at ⫺20 and ⫺80°c,
and under liquid nitrogen (⫺196°c). fresh erythrocytes representing
d 0 were assayed for ealt and east activities. additional enzyme
activities were measured from aliquots frozen at ⫺20 and ⫺80°c on
d 1, 7, 14, 28, 58 and 84, and for aliquots frozen at ⫺196°c on d 28,
58 and 84.
sample analyses. erythrocyte alanine and aspartate aminotransferase activities with and without plp stimulation in vitro were
analyzed by the method of woodring and storvick (7) using 0.33
mol/l  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.4). hemolysates were prepared by diluting

on d 0, ealt and east activity coefficients (ealt-ac
and east-ac) were measured. these  xxxd2716xxx -6 – dependent aminotransferase measurements reflect subjects’ vitamin
b-6 status at the beginning of the study. ealt-ac and
east-ac values (1.11 ⫾ 0.09 and 1.28 ⫾ 0.08, respectively)
indicated  xxxd2716xxx -6 nutritional adequacy because these
measurements averaged ⬍1.25 and 1.80, respectively (9).
in erythrocytes frozen at ⫺20°c, ealt basal activity was
16% lower (p ⱕ 0.07) by d 14 compared with d 0 (fig. 1, upper
panel). there were also 17 and 22% decreases in basal activity
by d 58 and 84 (p ⱕ 0.05 for both) in the samples frozen at
⫺20°c. in addition, ealt basal activity in samples frozen at
⫺20°c was 14% lower than in samples frozen at ⫺80°c by d
14, 20% lower by d 58 and 24% lower by d 84 (p ⱕ 0.05 for
all comparisons). on d 28, 58 and 84, samples frozen at ⫺20°c
had 22, 21 and 29% lower basal activity, respectively, than
samples frozen at ⫺196°c (p ⱕ 0.05 for all comparisons).
basal activity of ealt in samples frozen at ⫺80°c and
⫺196°c did not differ significantly from d 0 at any time
points. although the ealt-ac was not significantly different
from d 0 at any time point in samples frozen at all three
temperatures (fig. 1, lower panel), on d 7 and 28, the activity
coefficients were 7% (p ⱕ 0.05) and 5% higher (p ⱕ 0.11) in
samples frozen at ⫺20°c than in those frozen at ⫺80°c.
basal activity of east was 40% lower than d 0 on d 58 in
samples frozen at ⫺20°c (p ⱕ 0.05) (fig. 2, upper panel).
also, east basal activity was 33% lower (p ⱕ 0.05) in
samples frozen at ⫺20°c than in samples frozen at ⫺196°c on
d 58. erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase activity coefficients were not significantly different from d 0 at any time
point in samples frozen at all three temperatures (fig. 2, lower
panel). samples frozen at ⫺20°c had a significantly higher
east-ac on d 1 (38%) and 58 (30%) compared with sam-

packed cells 1:5 and 1:10 with deionized water for ealt and east,
respectively. briefly, in both assays, 0.1 ml hemolysate was incubated
with alanine or aspartate for 60 min at 37°c, in the presence and
absence of excess plp. after the reaction was stopped with trichloroacetic acid, 20 ␮l aniline citrate was added to the east reaction
mixture to convert oxaloacetate to pyruvate. one milliliter of 1 g/l
dinitrophenylhydrazine in 2.4 mol/l hcl, which reacts with pyruvate, was added and then extracted from the reaction mixture with 1
ml toluene. pyruvate-dinitrophenylhydrazine formed a colored compound when 1 ml alcoholic potassium hydroxide (25 g naoh/l
ethanol) was added. the absorbance, read at 490 nm, is proportional
to the concentration of product (pyruvate) formed. hemoglobin
(hb) concentration of the packed erythrocytes was determined by a
cyanmethemoglobin method (sigma chemical, st. louis, mo).
enzyme activities were expressed as mmol pyruvate/(l packed
erythrocytes 䡠 h) or mmol pyruvate/(g hb 䡠 h) and converted to
␮kat/l rbc and ␮kat/g hb. the activity coefficient was calculated
by the ratio of stimulated (plp added) to unstimulated activity.
erythrocyte aminotransferase activity measurements were carried out
under yellow light to prevent photodestruction. all analyses were
performed in triplicate.
statistical analysis. data were analyzed using the jmp statistical
analysis computer program and sas version 6.12 (sas institute,
cary, nc). means and standard deviations were calculated at each
time point for all measurements. repeated-measures anova was
used to test for statistical differences among means. dunnett’s test was
used to compare ealt and east mean basal activities and activity
coefficients at each time point with d 0. the least significant difference (lsd) multiple comparison test was used to compare means of
different storage temperatures at the same time point. statistical
comparisons were considered to be significant at p ⱕ 0.05. values are

variability in ealt and east activity between replicates
was 3.0 ⫾ 1.1% and 10.8 ⫾ 4.4%, respectively. interassay cv
of ealt and east basal activities were 12, 5 and 7%, and 21,

as ␮kat/l rbc or ␮kat/g hb.
discussion

the results of this study suggest a gradual loss of ealt
basal activity when packed erythrocytes are stored frozen at
⫺20°c, whereas enzyme activity of samples frozen at ⫺80 and
⫺196°c remains fairly stable. similarly, rose et al. (6) reported that after 10 –15 d of erythrocyte hemolysate storage at
⫺20°c, the activity of ealt decreased 45– 49%. the greater
decreases in ealt basal activity reported by rose et al. (6)
could be due to their use of a less concentrated frozen erythrocyte hemolysate preparation rather than packed cells. the
reduced ealt basal activity that results from storage at
⫺20°c may be due to increased labilization of the apoenzyme
over time and/or degradation of dissociated plp by phosphatases present in erythrocytes (10). in support of our findings in
samples frozen at lower temperatures, skala et al. (11) reported
that ealt basal activity was stable for 60 d at ⫺70°c.

respectively) in east activity coefficients in samples frozen at
⫺20 and ⫺80°c by d 7, and east-ac was significantly
higher (38%) in samples frozen at ⫺20°c compared with
samples frozen at ⫺80°c after only 1 d of storage. the tendency for east basal activity to decrease while the activity
coefficient increases again implies that with frozen storage, the
plp may be dissociating from the apoenzyme, which exposes it
to degradation by phosphatases present in the erythrocytes
(10). these data suggest that the ealt activity coefficient is
a more reliable measure than the east activity coefficient
when samples must be frozen before analysis.
another consideration is that the subjects in this study all
had adequate  xxxd2716xxx -6 status. in  xxxd2716xxx -6 – deficient
subjects, proportionally more of the apoenzyme form would be
present. the apoenzyme form may be more susceptible to
degradation during storage than the holoenzyme form. thus,
aminotransferase activities may be less stable in frozen erythrocytes from  xxxd2716xxx -6 – deficient individuals.
in summary, the present study demonstrates that both
ealt and east enzymes are prone to loss of basal activity
when frozen at ⫺20°c, whereas the ealt-ac is a more
stable and reliable measure of  xxxd2716xxx -6 status than eastac. packed erythrocyte preparations may provide greater
ealt and east enzyme stability than frozen diluted hemolysate preparations. if ealt activity cannot be measured
the same day blood is drawn, samples may be frozen at ⫺20°c
for 28 d or at ⫺80°c for no ⬎ 84 d; east activity should be
measured on fresh erythrocytes.

rose et al. (6) also reported that east basal activity
decreased 22–30% when hemolysates were stored for 10 –15 d
at ⫺20°c. in the present study, east basal activity in packed
cells frozen at ⫺20°c decreased significantly (40%) by d 58
and then increased to greater than baseline on d 84. high
intra- and interassay variability in the east assay is one
possible explanation for this observation. intra-assay variability between replicates in the east procedure was ⬎ 2 times
higher than in the ealt procedure, whereas interassay variability in east basal activity measurements was 1–2 times
higher than variability in ealt basal activity in samples
frozen at ⫺20 and ⫺80°c throughout the course of the study.
skala et al. (11) reported that east basal activity was stable
for up to 76 d at ⫺70°c.
nevertheless, studies evaluating  xxxd2716xxx -6 status usually
employ activity coefficients rather than basal activities. activity coefficients of ealt did not differ from d 0 at any of the
time points or storage temperatures, although there was a
downward trend after 28 d of storage. there were, however,
nonsignificant increases (17 and 18%, p ⫽ 0.60 and 0.25,
