abstract
the present study used nerve terminals (synaptosomes) isolated from
rat cerebral cortex to investigate the relationship between caffeine and  xxxd1804xxx  (4ap)-evoked endogenous excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate release. micromolar concentrations of caffeine facilitated 4ap, but not kcl or  xxxd2379xxx -evoked glutamate release from synaptosomes. this release facilitation resulted from an enhancement of vesicular and nonvesicular release and associated with an increase both in
4ap-evoked depolarization of the synaptosomal plasma membrane potential and in
4ap-evoked increase in the cytoplasmic free ca2þ concentration ([ca2þ]c). in addition,
the release facilitation by caffeine was signiﬁcantly reduced in synaptosomes pretreated with a wide spectrum blocker of n- and p/q-type ca2þ channels, o-conotoxin
mviic. furthermore, protein kinase c (pkc) activator and inhibitor, respectively,
superseding or suppressing the caffeine-mediated facilitation of glutamate release.
these results concluded that caffeine exerts their presynaptic facilitatory effect, likely
through the activation of pkc pathway, which subsequently enhances terminal excitability and ca2þ entry to cause an increase in evoked glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical nerve terminals. additionally, this release facilitation may involve an interaction of caffeine with presynaptic adenosine a1 receptors as adenosine  xxxg81xxx 
inhibition abolished the caffeine-mediated facilitation of evoked glutamate release.

introduction
maintenance of cognitive function into old age is a
growing concern, because the percentage of elderly
population in the world increases rapidly and the
age-related cognitive impairment becomes a common
phenomenon (morrison and patrick, 1997). in the
mammalian brain, involvement of numerous neurotransmitters in cognitive processing, learning, and
memory has been proposed (aigner, 1995). one of
these neurotransmitters is glutamate, an excitatory
neurotransmitter that exists in very high concentration in the central nervous system (cns) (bliss and
collingridge, 1993; fonnum, 1984). besides the normal physiological role, however, malfunction of brain
glutamate system has also been suggested to be associated with cognitive impairment of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as alzheimer’s disease (ad)

and parkinson’s disease (pd) (farber et al., 1998; lipton and rosenberg, 1994; meldrum and garthwaite,
1990). therefore, pharmacological manipulation of
brain glutamatergic neurotransmission may be a feasible strategy for treatment of memory dysfunction
and cognitive disorders.
caffeine, a plant alkaloid included in the class of
compounds known as methylxanthines, is the most
widely used psychoactive substance in the world. the

positive effect of caffeine on cognitive functioning,
including memory, has been reported by numerous
studies. for example, in a study of electrophysiological model of synaptic transmission, caffeine has been
found to produce long-term potentiation (ltp)
(martin and buno, 2003), a physiological correlate of
synaptic plasticity that is thought to underlie learning and memory (bliss and collingridge, 1993). furthermore, considerable evidence shows that caffeine
can improve cognitive function in animal as well as in
human models of learning and memory (angelucci
et al., 1999; gevaerd et al., 2001; heatherley et al.,
2005; javis, 1993; loke, 1988; riedel et al., 1995),
and this improvement has been shown to be associated with the function of caffeine in increasing alertness and attention or reducing fatigue (davis et al.,
2003; lorist and tops, 2003). the above ﬁndings indicate that caffeine may have beneﬁcial effects in the
context of memory and cognitive defects. however,
the precise mechanism of action of caffeine in improving cognitive performance has not been deﬁnitively
established, although adenosine antagonism is assumed to be the most important mechanism for
explaining the cognitive effect of caffeine (deslandes
et al., 2005).
considering that some aspects of cognition are
closely linked to an increase in glutamate release from
central nerve terminals (bekkers and stevens, 1990;
reid et al., 2004), raising the possibility that the cognition and memory enhancing effects of caffeine may be
correlated with the presynaptic enhancement of central
glutamate system. although, previous electrophysiological study has implicated caffeine in the modulation
of glutamate release (martin and buno, 2003), the
mechanism of which presynaptic caffeine effects are
mediated has not been examined directly using nerve
terminal preparations. the current study therefore
employed the isolated nerve terminal (synaptosome)
model to assess the characteristics and mechanisms of
action of caffeine in the regulation of glutamate exocytosis from nerve terminals puriﬁed from rat cerebral
cortex. using cerebrocortical synaptosomes, the present investigation found that caffeine produces a facilitatory effect on the release of glutamate evoked by 4aminopyridine (4ap), a  xxxg1232xxx  blocker that
depolarizes nerve terminals in vitro, in a manner corresponding to in vivo depolarization (tibbs et al., 1989).
to further examine the mechanism(s) involved, several
strategies were employed, and the data observed indicate that caffeine does not enhance exocytotic machinery directly, whereas ion-channel activities determining nerve terminal excitability, voltage-dependent
ca2þ inﬂux, and the protein kinase c (pkc) pathway
seem to be involved. moreover, a functional interaction
between the caffeine-mediated facilitation of glutamate
release and the presynaptic adenosine  xxxg81xxx 
activity has also been found in this study.

30 ,30 ,30 -dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (disc3(5))
and fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2-am) were
obtained from molecular probes (eugene, or). baﬁlomycin a1, dl-threo-b-benzyloxyaspartic acid (dltboa),  xxxd2195xxx  xi (ro32-0432), 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (dpcpx), and o-conotoxin mviic were obtained from tocris cookson
(bristol, uk). caffeine, phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma), 4a-phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (4apma), and all other reagents were obtained from
sigma (poole, dorset, uk) or merck (poole, dorset,
uk).
preparation of cerebrocortical synaptosomes
synaptosomes were puriﬁed as described previously
(nicholls and sihra, 1986). brieﬂy, the cerebral cortex
from 2-month-old male sprague-dawley rats was isolated and homogenized in a medium containing 320
mm sucrose, ph 7.4. the homogenate was spun for
2 min at 3000g (5000 rpm in a ja 25.5 rotor from
beckman) at 48c, and the supernatant was spun
again at 14,500g (11,000 rpm in a ja 25.5 rotor from
beckman) for 12 min. the pellet was gently resuspended in 8 ml of 320 mm sucrose, ph 7.4. two milliliters of this synaptosomal suspension was placed into
3 ml percoll discontinuous gradients containing 320
mm sucrose, 1 mm ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
(edta), 0.25 mm dl-dithiothreitol, and 3%, 10%, and
23% percoll, ph 7.4. the gradients were centrifuged
at 32,500g (16,500 rpm in a ja 20.5 rotor from beckman) for 7 min at 48c. synaptosomes placed between
the 10% and the 23% percoll bands were collected
and diluted in a ﬁnal volume of 30 ml of hepes
buffer medium (hbm) consisting of 140 mm nacl,
5 mm kcl, 5 mm nahco3, 1 mm mgcl26h2o, 1.2 mm
na2hpo4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n0 -2-ethanesulphonic acid (hepes) (ph
7.4) before centrifugation at 27,000g (15,000 rpm in a
ja 25.5 rotor from beckman) for 10 min. the pellets
thus formed were resuspended in 3 ml of hbm, and
the protein content was determined by the bradford
assay. synaptosomal suspension (0.5 mg) was diluted
in 10 ml of hbm and spun at 3000g (5000 rpm in a
ja 20.1 rotor from beckman) for 10 min. the supernatants were discarded, and the synaptosomal pellets
were stored on ice and used within 4–6 h.
measurement of glutamate release
glutamate release was assayed by on-line ﬂuorimetry as described previously (nicholls and sihra,
1986). synaptosomal pellets were resuspended in
hbm containing 16 mm bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa)
and incubated in a stirred and thermostated cuvette

caffeine modulation of glutamate release

maintained at 378c in a perkin-elmer ls-50b spectroﬂuorimeter. nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (nadp) (2 mm), glutamate dehydrogenase
(gdh; 50 units/ml) and cacl2 (1 mm) were added
after 3 min. in experiments examining ca2þ-independent efﬂux of glutamate, ethyleneglycolbis (aminoethyl ether)-tetra-acetate (egta) (200 mm) was added
in place of cacl2. other additions before depolarization were made as detailed in the ﬁgure legends. after a further 10 min of incubation,  xxxd1804xxx 
(4ap; 1 mm), kcl (15 mm) or  xxxd2379xxx  (5 mm) was
added to stimulate glutamate release. glutamate release was monitored by measuring the increase of ﬂuorescence (excitation and emission wavelengths of
340 nm and 460 nm respectively) due to nadph being
produced by the oxidative deamination of released glutamate by gdh. data were accumulated at 2.2-s intervals. a standard of exogenous glutamate (5 nmol) was
added at the end of each experiment and the ﬂuorescence response used to calculate released glutamate
was expressed as nmol glutamate per mg synaptosomal
protein (nmol/mg). cumulative data were analyzed
using lotus 1-2-3 and microcal origin.
membrane potential measurement using
disc3(5)
the synaptosomal membrane potential can be monitored by positively charged membrane potential-sensitive carbocyanine dyes, such as disc3(5) (akerman
et al., 1987). the dye becomes incorporated into the
synaptosomal plasma membrane lipid bilayer. upon
depolarization with 4ap, the release of the dye from the
membrane bilayer is indicated as an increase in ﬂuorescence. synaptosomes were preincubated and resuspended as described for the glutamate release experiments. after 3 min incubation, 5 mm disc3(5) was
added and allowed to equilibrate before the addition of
cacl2 (1 mm), caffeine or 4ap as described for glutamate release experiments. disc3(5) ﬂuorescence was
monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of
646 nm and 674 nm, respectively, and data was accumulated at 2.2-s intervals. cumulative data were analyzed using lotus 1-2-3 and results are expressed in
ﬂuorescence units.
cytosolic ca2þ concentration [ca2þ]c
measurements using fura-2
[ca2þ]c was measured using the ca2þ indicator
fura-2. synaptosomes (0.5 mg/ml) were preincubated
in hbm with 16 mm bsa in the presence of 5 mm
fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester and 0.1 mm cacl2 for
30 min at 378c in a stirred test tube. after fura-2
loading, synaptosomes were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 30 s at 3000g (5000 rpm). the synaptosomal pellets were resuspended (0.5 mg/ml) in hbm
with bsa and the synaptosomal suspension stirred in

a thermostatted cuvette in a perkin-elmer ls-50b
spectroﬂuorimeter. cacl2 (1 mm) was added after 3 min
and further additions were made after an additional
5 min, as described in the legends to the ﬁgures. fluorescence data were accumulated at excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm (emission wavelength
505 nm) at data accumulated  xxxd2274xxx .5-s intervals. calibration procedures were performed as described previously
(sihra et al., 1992), using 0.1% sodium  xxxd3215xxx 
to obtain the maximal ﬂuorescence with fura-2 saturation with ca2þ, followed by 10 mm egta (tris buffered)
to obtain minimum ﬂuorescence in the absence of any
fura-2/ca2þ complex. cytosolic free ca2þ concentration
([ca2þ]c, nm) was calculated using equations described
previously (grynkiewicz et al., 1985). cumulative data
were analyzed using lotus 1-2-3 and microcal origin.
statistical analysis
data are expressed as mean 6 sem to test the signiﬁcance of the effect of a drug vs. control, a twotailed student’s t test was used. when an additional
comparison was required (such as whether a second
treatment inﬂuenced the action of caffeine), a twoway repeated-measures analysis of variance (anova)
was computed. p < 0.05 was considered to represent
a signiﬁcant difference.
results
in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes, the release of
glutamate evoked by 1 mm 4ap, a  xxxg1232xxx 
blocker which has been shown to increase cytoplasmic
free ca2þ concentration by opening voltage-dependent
ca2þ channels and to induce the release of glutamate
release from isolated brain nerve terminals (tibbs
et al., 1989), was 7.6 6 0.5 nmol/mg/5 min in the
presence of 1 mm cacl2 (fig. 1; n ¼ 8). preincubation
of synaptosomes with 3 lm caffeine for 10 min before
4ap addition potently facilitated the release of glutamate evoked by 4ap to 11.7 6 0.3 nmol/mg/5 min
(n ¼ 8; p < 0.01; two-tailed student’s t test; fig. 1a),
without signiﬁcantly altering the basal glutamate release. as caffeine 3 lm produced a maximal effect
judging from a steep dose-response of the drug with
respect to 4ap-evoked glutamate release (7.8 6 0.4,
11.7 6 0.3, 11.3 6 0.8, and 11.4 6 0.4 nmol/mg/5 min
glutamate release in the presence of 1, 3, 10, and
30 lm, respectively) (fig. 1b), this concentration was
used in subsequent experiments to evaluate the cellular mechanisms underlying the facilitatory effect of
caffeine on evoked glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical nerve terminals.
to determine whether the regulation of glutamate
release by caffeine occurred downstream of ca2þ, this
study triggered glutamate release using the ca2þ ionophore  xxxd2379xxx , which causes a direct increase
in intrasynaptosomal ca2þ levels, without previous

depolarization and ca2þ-channel activation (shira
et al., 1992), to examine the effect of caffeine. as
shown in figure 1c,  xxxd2379xxx  (5 mm) caused a glutamate release of 6.7 6 0.4 nmol/mg/5 min (n ¼ 6). in the
presence of caffeine (3 lm),  xxxd2379xxx -induced release
of glutamate was not signiﬁcantly affected (6.5 6
0.3 nmol/mg/5 min; p > 0.05; two-tailed student’s t test),
indicating that an enhancement of release process at
some point subsequent to ca2þ inﬂux does not participate in the caffeine-mediated facilitation of glutamate
release from rat cerebrocortical nerve terminals.
to investigate whether the effect of caffeine on glutamate release reﬂected an effect on physiological exocytotic vesicular release or on the ca2þ-independent
release of glutamate attributable to cytosolic efﬂux via
the reversal of the glutamate transporter (nicholls
et al., 1987), the effect of caffeine on glutamate release
was examined in the presence of baﬁlomycin a1, which
depletes vesicle content by inhibiting the synaptic vesicle hþ-atpase that drives glutamate uptake, and dlthreo-b-benzyloxyaspartic acid ( xxxd2812xxx ), a glutamate
transporter inhibitor. as shown in figure 2a, control 4ap (1 mm)-evoked glutamate release was 8.1 6
0.2 nmol/mg/5 min, and this evoked release was inhibited by 0.1 mm baﬁlomycin a1 to 4.3 6 0.5 nmol/mg/
5 min (n ¼ 7; p < 0.01; two-tailed student’s t test). in
the baﬁlomycin a1-treated synaptosomes, while addition of 3 lm caffeine still caused a facilitation of 4apevoked release of about (23 6 6.3)% to 5.3 6 0.5 nmol/
mg/5 min (p < 0.05; repeated-measures anova), this
effect was signiﬁcantly different from the facilitation
produced by caffeine alone [(51.9 6 3.7)%; n ¼ 8; p <
0.05; repeated-measures anova] (fig. 2c). similarly,
application of  xxxd2812xxx  (10 lm) alone enhanced control
4ap-evoked release to 19.1 6 0.8 nmol/mg/5 min (n ¼
6; p < 0.01; two-tailed student’s t test; fig. 2b), but
failed to completely abolish the facilitatory effect of caffeine on 4ap-evoked glutamate release (22.5 6
1.1 nmol/mg/5 min; n ¼ 5). as shown in figure 2c,
although caffeine resulted in a (17.8 6 5.2)% facilitation on 4ap-evoked release after treatment with dltboa, this effect was also signiﬁcantly different from
the action of caffeine alone [(51.9 6 3.7)%; n ¼ 8; p <
0.05; repeated-measures anova]. these results suggest that caffeine facilitates 4ap-evoked glutamate
release through an enhancement of vesicular and nonvesicular release.
to further clarify the mechanism of caffeine-mediated facilitation of glutamate release from cerebrocortical synaptosomes, the present study used a membrane
potential-sensitive dye, disc3(5), to determine the
effect of caffeine on the synaptosomal plasma membrane potential. as shown in figure 3, 4ap (1 mm)
application caused an increase in disc3(5) ﬂuorescence
of 0.78 6 0.04 ﬂuorescence units/3 min. preincubation
of synaptosomes with caffeine (3 mm) for 10 min before

effect on the 4ap-mediated increase in disc3(5) ﬂuorescence (1.19 6 0.09 ﬂuorescence units/3 min; n ¼ 7;

4ap-evoked glutamate release is likely to be due to a
increase of synaptosomal depolarization produced by
4ap. conﬁrmation that the caffeine effect impinge on
synaptosomal excitability was obtained with experiments using high external [kþ]-mediated depolariza-

tion, which \clamps" the membrane potential according to the imposed kþ electrochemical gradient and
thereby activates voltage-dependent ca2þ channels
(vdccs). addition of 15 mm kcl effected a control
release of 9.4 6 0.4 nmol /mg/5 min, which was not
affected in the presence of 3 lm caffeine (9.2 6 0.3

increase in presynaptic ca2þ level, the effect of caffeine on the 4ap-evoked increase of [ca2þ]c was
assessed using the ca2þ indicator fura-2. as shown
in figure 4, elevation in [ca2þ]c occurred after addition of 4ap (1 mm) to synaptosomes and reached a
plateau level of 202.8 6 2.2 nm. this 4ap-evoked rise
in [ca2þ]c was increased by 48 nm (250.9 6 3.2 nm)
with caffeine (3 mm) preincubation (n ¼ 5; p < 0.01;
two-tailed student’s t test). in addition, glutamate
release from synaptic terminal is triggered by the
entry of ca2þ through voltage-dependent n- and p/qtype ca2þ channels (turner and dunlap, 1995; vazquez and sanchez-prieto, 1997). thus, to examine
whether the modulation of these ca2þ channel activities was involved in the caffeine-mediated facilitation
of glutamate release, the effect of caffeine on 4apevoked glutamate release was examined before and
after the application o-conotoxin mviic (o-cgtx
mviic), a wide spectrum blocker of n-, p-, and qtype ca2þ channels. as shown in the inset i and ii of
figure 4, o-cgtx mviic (2 lm) reduced control 4apevoked glutamate release by 53% from control 8.1 6
0.3 to 3.8 6 0.5 nmol/mg/5 min (n ¼ 5; p < 0.01; twotailed student’s t test). in the presence of o-cgtx
mviic, caffeine (3 lm) only enhanced 4ap-evoked
glutamate release by a further (13.2 6 2.9)% (4.3 6
0.4 nmol/mg/5 min) compared with control after the
application of o-cgtx mviic, which was signiﬁcantly
less than that when caffeine was applied alone
[(50.6 6 3.6)%, n ¼ 8; p < 0.05; repeated-measures
anova].
in addition, in view of the demonstrated role of
pkc in presynaptic modulation (sihra and nichols,

1993), the present study examined whether activation
of pkc was also involved in the action of caffeine. to
test this possibility, the effect of caffeine was examined in the presence of ro 32-0432 ( xxxd2195xxx  xi), a pkc inhibitor. as shown in figure 5, preincubation of synaptosomes with ro 32-0432 (1 mm)
for 30 min did not signiﬁcantly affect control 4apevoked glutamate release (7.8 6 0.6 nmol/mg/5 min;
n ¼ 6; p > 0.05; two-tailed student’s t test). in the
ro 32-0432-treated synaptosomes, the facilitatory
action of caffeine (3 lm) on 4ap-evoked glutamate
release was signiﬁcantly attenuated (8.1 6 0.2 nmol/
mg/5 min) (n ¼ 6; p < 0.05; repeated-measures
anova). in addition, the facilitatory effect of caffeine
on 4ap-evoked glutamate release was also occluded
by the pkc activator phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate
(pma) (1 lm) (p < 0.05; repeated-measures anova),
whereas the inactive analog 4a-phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx 
13-acetate (4a-pma) (1 lm) was without effect (p >
0.05; repeated-measures anova) [(nmol/mg/5 min):
pma þ 4ap, 12.4 6 0.9; pma þ caffeine þ 4ap, 13.1 6

4ap, 12.8 6 0.5] (n ¼ 4; fig. 5). these results suggest that a pkc-dependent pathway is possibly involved in the observed effect of caffeine on 4apevoked glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical
synaptosomes.
finally, to determine whether the observed facilitating action of caffeine was related to the blockade of presynaptic adenosine a1 receptors, as suggested in previous study (martin and buno, 2003), the effects of caffeine on 4ap-evoked glutamate release were compared

discussion
site and mechanism of caffeine-enhanced
glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical
nerve terminals
using in vitro release study in rat cerebral cortex
nerve terminals, the present study demonstrates
for the ﬁrst time that caffeine facilitates the 4apinduced glutamate release. a key issue to address is
the nature of the mechanism responsible for caffeinefacilitated glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical
synaptosomes.
the released glutamate produced by the depolarization of isolated nerve terminals is known to have two
components: the ca2þ-dependent component, which is
produced by exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing
glutamate, and the ca2þ-independent component that
is attributed to the reversal of glutamate transporter
(nicholls et al., 1987). in the ﬁrst place, this study
attempted to discriminate the effect of caffeine on
these two components of endogenous glutamate resynapse doi 10.1002/syn

lease evoked by 4ap. the present ﬁnding is that caffeine does not only facilitate the ca2þ-dependent exocytosis of glutamate, but also the ca2þ-independent
nonvesicular release. this conclusion stems from the
basis of two observations. first, besides 4ap-evoked
ca2þ-dependent release, caffeine was also able to
facilitate 4ap-evoked glutamate release in a calcium
free medium containing egta (ca2þ-independent release) (data not shown). second, the facilitatory effect
of caffeine on 4ap-evoked glutamate release was signiﬁcantly attenuated by baﬁlomycin a1, a v-atpase inhibitor that dissipates the electrochemical proton gradient necessary for glutamate uptake in vesicles, or
by glutamate transporter inhibitor  xxxd2812xxx  that
increased glutamate release by heteroexchange. these
results suggest that caffeine-mediated facilitation of
4ap-evoked glutamate release is accounted for by an
enhancement of vesicular and nonvesicular release
process.
to further clarify the presynaptic site of caffeinefacilitated glutamate release from cerebrocortical
nerve terminals, the ca2þ ionophore  xxxd2379xxx  was
used in this study to trigger glutamate release.
because  xxxd2379xxx  directly increases intrasynaptosomal ca2þ and induces neurotransmitter release in the
absence of ca2þ channel activation (sihra et al., 1992),
this phenomenon allows the inﬂuences that directly
affect the exocytotic release machinery to be isolated.
the observation that caffeine had no effect on the  xxxd2379xxx -induced glutamate release, therefore suggesting
that caffeine-mediated facilitation of glutamate release
is not a consequence of a direct enhancement of some
exocytotic steps after ca2þ inﬂux.
activation of naþ channels or inhibition of kþ
channels is known to increase in nerve terminal excitability, which subsequently enhances the ca2þ entry
and causes an increase in neurotransmitter release
(li et al., 1993; rehm and temple, 1991). whether
the observed facilitatory effect of glutamate release
by caffeine could occur by increasing nerve terminal
excitability, for conﬁrmation, this study assessed
directly the effect of caffeine on synaptosomal plasma
membrane potential. the observation that 4apinduced depolarization of the synaptosomal plasma
membrane potential, measured with a membrane
potential sensitive dye disc3(5), was signiﬁcantly
increased by caffeine. furthermore, it was found that
caffeine did not affect glutamate release evoked by
direct depolarization with kcl, whereas it signiﬁcantly facilitated glutamate release evoked by 4ap.
this indicates that a direct enhancement of the exocytotic-coupled ca2þ channel activity seems not to be
involved in the action of caffeine, because 4ap-evoked
glutamate release involves the action of both naþ and
ca2þ channels and kcl-evoked glutamate release
involves only ca2þ channels (nicholls, 1993; tibbs
et al., 1989). although there is lack of direct evidence

for caffeine actions on presynaptic ion channels, from
these results clearly indicate the inﬂuence of ionchannel activities (e.g., naþ or kþ channel) determining synaptosomal excitability as a potential mechanism underlying the facilitation of glutamate release
by caffeine.
in addition, the present observation, using fura-2,
that caffeine enhanced the 4ap-induced rise in
[ca2þ]c, and suggests that the increment in presynaptic ca2þ level is involved in the caffeine-mediated
facilitation of evoked glutamate release. consistent
with this hypothesis, previous study from electrophysiological model of synaptic transmission, has showed
that, caffeine produces a long-term potentiation of
excitatory transmission by increasing presynaptic
ca2þ and glutamate release probability (martin and
buno, 2003). in relation to the cellular mechanism of
the caffeine-increased [ca2þ]c reported here, it could
be due to an increase in ca2þ entry through presynaptic voltage-dependent ca2þ channels because ocgtx mviic, a wide spectrum blocker of n-, p-, and
q-type ca2þ channels, largely reduced the facilitatory
effect of caffeine on 4ap-evoked glutamate release.
however, this toxin could not block the action of caffeine fully, implies that, in addition to the enhancement of ca2þ inﬂux through presynaptic n- and p/qtype ca2þ channels, other unidentiﬁed types of ca2þ
channels or presynaptic stores released ca2þ might
be also involved in the action of caffeine.

why intracellular signaling is necessary for the
action of caffeine in the regulation of glutamate
release in cerebral cortex nerve terminals? given the
pkc signaling cascade is known to be present at the
presynaptic level where it enhances glutamate exocytosis (barrie et al., 1991; stevens and sullivan, 1998),
raising the possibility that the activation of pkc
could be involved in the observed caffeine-mediated
facilitation of glutamate release. this eventuality is
supported by the observation that the facilitatory
effect of caffeine on 4ap-evoked glutamate release
was markedly prevented by the prior suppression of
pkc activity. furthermore, pma, by bypassing pkc
activation, effectively superseded facilitatory effect of
caffeine conﬁrmed the role of pkc in the caffeinemediated facilitation of depolarization-evoked glutamate release. in addition, in other experiments not
shown here this study has found that the pka inhibitor  xxxd477xxx  did not block the facilitatory effect of caffeine
on the glutamate release evoked by 4ap, suggesting
that the signaling through this release facilitation by
caffeine seems not to involve pka.

caffeine-mediated release facilitation and the

adenosine receptors, and mobilizing intracellular calcium
(deslandes et al., 2005; nehlig et al., 1992). among these
mechanisms, blockade of adenosine receptors is currently
believed to underlie most of the cns effects of caffeine
under normal physiological circumstances (fredholm
et al., 1999; kaplan et al., 1992). given that inhibitory
actions of adenosine a1 receptors on glutamate release
have been suggested to occur by suppression of voltagedependent ca2þ entry (wu and saggau, 1994), it is
tempting to speculate that caffeine-increased ca2þ entry
by antagonizing adenosine a1 receptors, may underlie, at
least in part, the facilitation of ca2þ inﬂux and glutamate
release observed here. concerning this eventuality, the
present study compared the effect of caffeine on 4apevoked glutamate release in the absence or presence of
adenosine  xxxg81xxx  antagonist dpcpx. the observation is that dpcpx alone facilitated 4ap-evoked glutamate release. judging by this ﬁnding, it would appear
that adenosine a1 receptors present in our synaptosomal
preparation serving to limit the release of glutamate.
however, when combined application of dpcpx and caffeine, the facilitation of 4ap-evoked glutamate release
was no greater than seen with either agent alone. the
lack of additivity in the action of caffeine indicates a functional interaction between caffeine-facilitated glutamate
release and presynaptic adenosine  xxxg81xxx  activity.
this hypothesis is consistent with previous studies showing that caffeine relieves the adenosine a1 receptorsmediated presynaptic inhibition (fredholm et al., 1999)
and caffeine-mediated potentiation of synaptic transmission requires the inhibition of presynaptic adenosine a1
receptors (martin and buno, 2003). however, the present
study could not rule out the possibility that blockade of
adenosine a2 receptors also may play a relevant role in
the observed facilitatory effect of caffeine on glutamate
release, as suggested previously (dall’igna et al., 2003;
popoli et al., 1998; svenningsson et al., 1997).
in conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that, in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes,
caffeine facilitates 4ap-evoked glutamate release possibly through the activation of pkc pathway to
enhance synaptosomal excitability as well as ca2þ
inﬂux. furthermore, this caffeine-mediated release
faciliatory process may have a functional correlation
with presynaptic adenosine a1 receptors. in cns, an
enhancement of glutamate release from nerve terminals is one of the main mechanisms for the formation
of several certain forms of cognitive function such as
learning and memory (bliss and collingridge, 1993;
reid et al., 2004). considering that the memoryimproving effect observed with caffeine treatment has
been reported in several preliminary clinical studies
(gevaerd et al., 2001; maia, 2002; riedel et al., 1995),
the ﬁnding of caffeine to facilitate glutamate release
from cerebrocortical nerve terminals may provide a
contribution to the understanding of the central
effects of caffeine.
