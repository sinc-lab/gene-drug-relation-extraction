rifampicin-activated human  xxxg1598xxx  and cyp3a4 induction enhance acetaminophen-induced toxicity.  acetaminophen (apap) is safe at therapeutic levels but causes hepatotoxicity via n-acetyl- xxxd309xxx  imine-induced oxidative stress upon overdose. to determine the effect of human (h)  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ) activation and cyp3a4 induction on apap-induced hepatotoxicity, mice humanized for  xxxg1598xxx  and cyp3a4 (tgcyp3a4/hpxr) were treated with apap and rifampicin. human  xxxg1598xxx  activation and cyp3a4 induction enhanced apap-induced hepatotoxicity as revealed by hepatic  xxxg941xxx  (alt) and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) activities elevated in serum, and hepatic necrosis after coadministration of rifampicin and apap, compared with apap administration alone. in contrast, hpxr mice, wild-type mice, and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice exhibited significantly lower alt/ast levels compared with tgcyp3a4/hpxr mice after apap administration. toxicity was coincident with depletion of hepatic glutathione and increased production of  xxxd2298xxx , suggesting increased oxidative stress upon hpxr activation. moreover, mrna analysis demonstrated that cyp3a4 and other  xxxg1598xxx  target genes were significantly induced by rifampicin treatment. urinary metabolomic analysis indicated that cysteine-apap and its metabolite s-(5-acetylamino-2-hydroxyphenyl)mercaptopyruvic acid were the major contributors to the toxic phenotype. quantification of plasma apap metabolites indicated that the apap dimer formed coincident with increased oxidative stress. in addition, serum metabolomics revealed reduction of lysophosphatidylcholine in the apap-treated groups. these findings demonstrated that human  xxxg1598xxx  is involved in regulation of apap-induced toxicity through cyp3a4-mediated hepatic metabolism of apap in the presence of  xxxg1598xxx  ligands.
