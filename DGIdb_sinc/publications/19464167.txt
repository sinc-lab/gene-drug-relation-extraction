this work was undertaken (i) to study deeply the estrogen, androgen and progestative activities of  xxxd3372xxx 
and its metabolites (ii) to determine whether  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites present glucocorticoid or
mineralocorticoid activity. for this purpose, we used human cell lines bearing a luciferase gene with a
responsive element under the control of human  xxxg730xxx  ␣ (er␣) or  xxxg730xxx  ␤ (er␤) or
 xxxg183xxx  (ar) or chimeric gal4 fusion with  xxxg1737xxx  (pr),  xxxg1601xxx 
(gr) or  xxxg1602xxx  (mr). the major  xxxd3372xxx  metabolites, the two hydroxymetabolites,
bind and activate er with a preference for er␣.  xxxd3372xxx  and the 4 - xxxd3372xxx  are agonists for ar and
pr and surprisingly 3␣- and 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  are antagonists for them. moreover we showed for the ﬁrst
time that  xxxd3372xxx  and its primary metabolites are gr and mr antagonists with a stronger afﬁnity for
mr than for gr. in conclusion,  xxxd3372xxx  by these actions on different receptors and by this capacity to
transform in different metabolites, has more complex effects than initially supposed.

1. introduction
 xxxd3372xxx  (org od14), a synthetic 19-norsteroid related to
norethynodrel (ned) is an interesting alternative for hormonal
treatment of menopause. in randomized studies,  xxxd3372xxx  has been
shown to improve menopausal symptoms to a similar degree of
combined estrogen/progestogen hormonal therapy [1–3]. moreover, clinical trials showed its interest on bone density [4,5], since
 xxxd3372xxx  acts as a bone resorption inhibitor in a similar way to estrogens. in two cohort studies in the uk a small increase in endometrial
cancer was observed [6,7], but the results of a randomized controlled trial (the thebes trial) does not show any stimulation of
endometrial proliferation [8]. in this study,  xxxd3372xxx  shows less

breast pain than  xxxd2044xxx  (cee) plus  xxxd2554xxx  (mpa).  xxxd3372xxx  acts as a pro-drug and is
rapidly converted into 3 main metabolites. in plasma, the 3␣-ohtibolone is the main metabolite [9] followed by the 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx .
 xxxd3372xxx  and the 4 isomer are only present during the ﬁrst 6 h
after oral intake.
the 4 isomer has progestin and androgen properties while the
3␣- and the 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  have estrogenic properties [10]. the
tissue selective action of  xxxd3372xxx  is supposed to be a combination
of receptor activation and steroid metabolism [11].
using in vitro transactivation measurements with chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells, it has been demonstrated that  xxxd3372xxx  and
4 - xxxd3372xxx  were agonistic ligands of  xxxg1737xxx  (pr),
 xxxg183xxx  (ar) and  xxxg730xxx  (ers) whereas 3␣and 3␤-hydroxytibolone were only active on ers [10]. cho cells
were chosen because the metabolism of the major sex steroids
was very limited and the intrinsic hormonal properties of synthetic
steroids could be accurately determined [12]. potential disadvantages of the cho cells are that they contain a different pallet of
co-activators and corepressors than the human target cells. ideally the receptor–reporter systems should be transfected in a cell
line derived from the target tissue, but unfortunately such cell lines

are not always accessible. here we have used the hela human cell
line transfected with human ers, pr, gr or mr and a reporter
system. er␣ and er␤ reporter cells were obtained by transfecting
hela cells (er negative) successively by the ere-␤glob-luc-svneo
plasmid (heln cell line) and psg5puro plasmids expressing er␣
or er␤ (heln er␣ and heln er␤ cells). since the ers cell lines
are derived from the same heln cell line, the effect of both ers is
determined by the same ere. pr, gr and mr recognize the same
hormone responsive element. as hela cells express gr, we constructed chimeric receptors in which each part ensures to obtain
the required hormonal speciﬁcity: one part is the hormone binding
domain of pr, gr or mr, the other part is the dna binding domain
of yeast gal4 protein. after binding with the steroid hormone these
chimeric receptors are able to interact with the gal4 responsive
element placed upstream the luciferase gene. thus, pr, gr and mr
reporter cells were obtained by transfecting hela cells successively
by the gal4re5-bglob-luc-svneo plasmid (hg5ln cell line) and
the psg5puro plasmids fused with the gal4 dbd and the lbd of pr,
mr or gr (hg5ln gal4-pr, -mr and -gr cells). this assay format
eliminated background activity from endogenous receptors allowing quantiﬁcation of relative activity for the three steroid receptors
with the same reporter gene. this strategy could not be used for ar
since the a/b domain deleted receptor does not transactivate. thus
we developed a  xxxg1682xxx  cell line expressing the complete human ar
and the same responsive reporter gene as used for gr, mr and pr.
in the present study, we used these different bioluminescent
reporter cell lines to conﬁrm that  xxxd3372xxx  and its primary metabolites are ligands for human pr, ar and/or er. interestingly, our
data indicate that these compounds are also able to bind  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) and mineralocorticoid (mr) and exhibit
low antiglucocorticoid and moderate antimineralocorticoid activities. altogether, our study point out that  xxxd3372xxx  and its primary
metabolites exert multiple and complex effects on all steroid hormone receptors.
2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals and materials
materials for cell culture came from life technologies (cergypontoise, france) except 96-well cellstar plates, which were
obtained from greiner labortechnic (poitiers, france). luciferin
(sodium salt) and  xxxd2191xxx  were purchased from promega
(charbonnières, france).  xxxd2631xxx  was purchased from nen life
science products (paris, france). [3 h]-aldosterone (39 ci/mmol
speciﬁc activity) and [3 h]-dexamethasone (84 ci/mmol) were
purchased from amersham-ge healthcare europe gmbh (orsay,
france). r5020 (promegestone) was a gift from sanoﬁ-aventis
(romainville, france). 17␤-estradiol (e2), testosterone, aldosterone
(aldo), dexamethasone (dex),  xxxd3041xxx  and aminogluthetimide (ag) were purchased from sigma aldrich (saint-quentin
fallavier, france).  xxxd3372xxx  [(7␣,17␣)-17-hydroxy-7-methyl-19norpregn-5(10)-en-20-yn-3-one];
4 - xxxd3372xxx 
[(7␣,17␣)-17hydroxy-7-methyl-19-norpregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one]; 3␣-oh- xxxd3372xxx  [(3␣,7␣,17␣)-7-methyl-19-norpregn-5(10)-en-20-yne-3,17diol]; 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  [(3␤,7␣,17␣)-7-methyl-19-norpregn-5(10)en-20-yne-3,17-diol] were supplied by the department of medicinal chemistry of organon, part of schering-plough, oss, the
netherlands. these ligands were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx 
(dmso)  xxxd1891xxx −2 m and dilutions from this stock solution were
prepared in culture medium.
2.2. reporter cell lines for human er, ar, pr, gr and mr
the heln er␣ and heln er␤ reporter cell lines were previously
described [13,14] and cultured in dmem without phenol red, sup-

plemented with 6% dextran-coated, charcoal-treated fcs, 1 mg/ml
 xxxg418xxx  and 0.5 ␮g/ml  xxxd3041xxx .
to study the potential activity of  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites
via the ar, we used the palm cell line obtained from  xxxg1682xxx  cells
stably transfected with the complete human ar and a luciferase
gene under transcriptional control of mmtv [15]. hg5ln cells were
obtained by transfecting hela cells successively by the gal4re5␤glob-luc-svneo plasmid and by psg5puro plasmids fused with
the gal4 dbd and the lbd of pr, mr or gr) [16]. hg5ln gal4pr, gal4-mr and gal4-gr were cultured in dmem with phenol
red, supplemented with 5% fcs, 1 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx  ( xxxd2191xxx ) and
0.5 ␮g/ml  xxxd3041xxx . in some experiments, aminogluthetimide
(ag) was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 50 ␮m
to inhibit the intrinsic aromatase activity in hela cells. palm cells
were obtained as already described [15] and cultured in ham’s f12,
supplemented with 5% fcs, 1 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx  and 1 ␮g/ml  xxxd3041xxx .
2.3. luciferase assays: stable gene expression assays for ers, ar,
pr, gr and mr
reporter cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well,
in 96-well white opaque tissue culture plates and maintained in
dmem without phenol red, supplemented with 6% fcs treated
with dextran-coated charcoal (dcc) (except for palm cells, which
were maintained in ham’s f12, supplemented with 6% dcc–fcs).
 xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites were tested at concentrations range
(see legends) in at least three independent experiments performed
in quadruplicate. the assays were used for testing both agonistic
and antagonistic activities of  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites. the reference compounds for ers, ar, pr, gr and mr were e2,  xxxd2631xxx , r5020,
dex and aldo, respectively. for testing the antagonistic activity the
cells were stimulated with a concentration (see text and legends)
of the reference compound and co-incubated with a dose range of
 xxxd3372xxx  or one of its metabolites.
the luciferase substrate was added after 8 h, 16 h or 40 h (40 h
only with palm cell line) of treatment, the medium containing
effectors was removed and replaced by culture medium (dmem
without phenol red or ham’s f12, supplemented with 6% dcc fcs)
containing 0.3 mm luciferin. at this concentration, luciferin diffuses
into the cell and, about 5 min later, produces a stable luminescent
signal which was quantiﬁed using a microbeta wallac luminometer
(integration during 2 s).
2.4. ligand binding assays for gr and mry
hg5ln-galgr or hg5ln-galmr cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates and grown
in 6% dcc–fcs. for ligand competition experiments,  xxxd3372xxx  and
its metabolites were tested at least three times. cells were labeled
with 3 nm of [1,2,4,6,7-3 h] dexamethasone or 1 nm of [1,2-3 h]aldosterone at 37 ◦ c for 3 h in the absence or presence of increasing
concentrations of non-radioactive competitive compounds.
the ﬁnal incubation volume was 400 ␮l and each dilution was
performed in duplicate. after incubation, unbound material was
aspirated and cells washed three times with 400 ␮l of cold pbs.
then, 250 ␮l lysis buffer (400 mm nacl, 25 mm tris phosphate ph
7.8, 2 mm dtt, 2 mm edta, 10% glycerol, 1% triton x-100) was
added and plates were shaked for 5 min. total cell lysate (200 ␮l)
was mixed with 4 ml of lsc-cocktail (emulsiﬁer-safe, packard
bioscience) and [3 h] bound radioactivity was liquid scintillation
counted (ls-6000-sc, beckman-coulter, roissy, france). protein
concentrations were measured by bio-rad protein assay and used
to normalize bound radioactivity values expressed in dpm. results
were plotted as measured dpm versus concentration of tested
compound. ic50 values were deﬁned as compound concentration
required decreasing maximum [3 h]-compound binding by 50%.

2.5. data analysis
for each test, independent experiments were performed in triplicate for each concentration and data are shown as mean ± sd.
individual concentration–response curves, for the agonistic and
antagonistic assays, were ﬁtted using the sigmoidal dose–response
function of a graphics and statistics software (graph-pad prism,
version 4.0, 2003, graphpad software incorporated, san diego.
ca). agonistic transactivation data are presented as ec50 values,
effective concentration for half-maximal luciferase activity and
antagonistic transactivation data as ic50 , half-maximal inhibitory
concentration for each compound tested. binding data are presented as ic50 values, effective concentration to decrease maximum
[3 h]-compound binding by 50%.
3. results
3.1. in vitro estrogen receptors studies
we used heln er␣ and heln er␤ cell lines [13,14] to evaluate
the estrogenic activities of  xxxd3372xxx  and its primary metabolites.
in heln parental cells, neither e2 nor  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites
induced luciferase expression. on the contrary, a small decrease
was observed for  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites at concentrations
higher than 1 ␮m. this is probably due to toxicity (data not shown).
in heln er␣ and heln er␤ cell lines, the ec50 value of e2 was
respectively 0.018 and 0.08 nm (fig. 1a and b).  xxxd3372xxx  and its
metabolites were full agonists for ers but their potency appeared
very low compared to e2 (fig. 1a and b). in heln er␣ cells, 3␣, 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  and  xxxd3372xxx  displayed higher activity on er␣
transactivation (ec50 of 1.7, 2.4 and 4.3 nm, respectively) than 4 -

 xxxd3372xxx  (ec50 of 26 nm). by contrast,  xxxd3372xxx  and its derivatives
were less active on er␤. 3 compounds have the same potency to
activate er␤ (ec50 of 3␣-hydroxytibolone 100 nm, ec50 of  xxxd3372xxx 
105 nm, ec50 of 3␤-hydroxytibolone 115 nm) compared to 4  xxxd3372xxx  (ec50 of 300 nm).
parental heln cells contain aromatase activity. in order to
demonstrate that the estrogenic activity of  xxxd3372xxx  was not dependent on its aromatization, we measured its activity in the presence
of aminogluthetimide (ag), an inhibitor of aromatase. the positive
control, testosterone (which is transformed in estradiol by aromatase) was found to be less active in stimulating heln er␣ cells
treated with ag than in cells untreated with ag (fig. 2b). on the
contrary, the estrogenic activity of estradiol was not modiﬁed in
the presence of ag (fig. 2a). as shown in fig. 2c, the estrogenic
activity of  xxxd3372xxx  was not modiﬁed in the presence of ag indicating that it was not due to its aromatization. furthermore,  xxxd3372xxx 
is able to bind er with an afﬁnity which reﬂects its transcriptional
activity [data not shown, 10].  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites did not
show antagonistic activity for the ers.

(fig. 3b). 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  was only partially active after 8 h of incubation but it became more active after 16 h and 40 h of treatment
(fig. 3b). these results suggest that 3␤-hydroxylated  xxxd3372xxx  can
be progressively transformed in an active androgen which might be
 xxxd3372xxx  or the 4 isomer. interestingly, this did not occur with the
3␤-hydroxylated  xxxd3372xxx  but acted surprisingly as an antagonist
(ic50 135 nm in the presence of 1 nm  xxxd2631xxx ) (fig. 3c).  xxxd3372xxx , 4
isomer and 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  expressed no antagonistic ar activity.

(䊉),  xxxd3372xxx  (), 4- xxxd3372xxx  (), 3␣-oh- xxxd3372xxx  () and 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  () at
the indicated concentrations for 40 h. maximal activity (100%) corresponds to the
activity obtained with 100 nm  xxxd2631xxx . values are mean ± s.d. from three separate
experiments. palm cell line (b) was treated with  xxxd2631xxx  ( ) or 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  (- - - -) at the indicated concentrations for 8 h (), 16 h () and 40 h (). palm cell line
(c) was treated with 3␣-oh- xxxd3372xxx  () and 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  () in the presence
of  xxxd2631xxx  1 nm. values are mean ± s.d. from three separate experiments.

hela cells were chosen as the host cell line for the luciferase
reporter gene driven by a pentamer of the gal4 recognition
sequence in front of the ␤-globin promoter. this reporter system
is insensitive to endogenous receptors which cannot recognize the
gal4 binding site. these cells called hg5ln cells were then transfected with the dna binding domain of the yeast transactivator
gal4 fused to the ef domain (which contain the lbd and the af-2
activation function) of human pr (gal4-pr), human gr (gal4-gr)
or human mr (gal4-mr) [16]. r5020, dexamethasone, aldosterone,
 xxxd3372xxx  or its metabolites did not induce luciferase expression in
the parental cell line hg5ln (data not shown).
in hg5ln gal4-pr, the ec50 value for the progestin r5020 was
5 nm.  xxxd3372xxx  and the 4 isomer were full pr agonists (fig. 4a).
the 4 isomer displayed the highest potency to transactivate ar
(ec50 46 nm) as compared to  xxxd3372xxx  which was less active (ec50
123 nm). by contrast, the 3-hydroxylated metabolites of  xxxd3372xxx 
did not activate pr (fig. 4a).
using respectively hg5ln gal4-gr and hg5ln gal4-mr cells,
we determined that the ec50 values were 6 nm for dexamethasone
(dex) (fig. 4b) and 0.36 nm for aldosterone (aldo) (fig. 4c). by contrast, using these reporter cell lines, we found that  xxxd3372xxx  and
its metabolites did not exhibit glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid
activity (fig. 4b and c).
we then tested the antagonistic activity of  xxxd3372xxx  and its
metabolites on reference stimulated pr, gr and mr activity. in the
presence of 5 nm r5020, the 3-hydroxylated compounds showed
a weak activity of complete pr antagonist (ic50 corresponding
to 20 ␮m for 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  and 2.4 ␮m for 3␣-oh- xxxd3372xxx )
(fig. 5a). all the  xxxd3372xxx  compounds were also antagonists on gr
upon activation using 10 nm dex, but not completely (fig. 5b). the
ic50 value was 1.7 ␮m for the 4 isomer, 10 ␮m for  xxxd3372xxx , and
not measurable for 3␣-oh- xxxd3372xxx  and 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  (fig. 5b).
finally, as shown in fig. 5c,  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites were antagonists for mr (activated by aldosterone at 0.5 nm concentration).
again, the 4 isomer was the better antagonist (ic50 of 30 nm) followed by  xxxd3372xxx  (ic50 of 170 nm) and the 3-oh-tibolones (ic50
corresponding to 1.2 ␮m for 3␣-oh- xxxd3372xxx  and 3.3 ␮m for 3␤oh- xxxd3372xxx ) (fig. 5c).

3.2. in vitro  xxxg183xxx  studies

3.4. binding of  xxxd3372xxx  to gr and mr

to study the potential activity of  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites
via the ar, we used the palm cell line obtained from  xxxg1682xxx  cells
stably transfected with human ar and a luciferase gene under
transcriptional control of mmtv [15]. as shown in fig. 3a, the
ec50 value for the synthetic androgen  xxxd2631xxx  in palm cells was
0.1 nm.  xxxd3372xxx  and the 4 isomer behaved as full agonists for ar
(fig. 3a), the 4 isomer displaying the best transactivation potency
(ec50 0.2 nm vs 1.05 nm). the activity of 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  was variable (see error bars), which may be caused by metabolism. we
tested therefore 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  during shorter incubation times.
 xxxd2631xxx  showed the same transactivation for all three times of incubations, but the ar transactivation increased with exposure time

to determine whether the antagonistic effects of  xxxd3372xxx  as
observed in the gr and mr transactivation experiments reﬂected
their binding to the receptors, we performed “whole-cell” competition binding assays using hg5ln-gal4-gr and hg5ln-gal4-mr
cells. the binding afﬁnities of  xxxd3372xxx  and its metabolites for gr
were assessed using 3 nm [3 h]-dexamethasone as a tracer. 4  xxxd3372xxx  was the most effective compound, inhibiting the binding
of dexamethasone at a 10 ␮m concentration (fig. 6a). the binding
afﬁnity of  xxxd3372xxx  was very low but was able to signiﬁcantly displace dexamethasone from gr  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m (fig. 6a). the least effective
compounds were the 3-hydroxylated ligands, which showed low
binding afﬁnity for gr.

corresponds to the activity obtained with 10 nm aldosterone. values are mean ± s.d.

binding to mr was assessed using 1 nm [3 h]-aldosterone as a
tracer.  xxxd3372xxx  and 4 isomer inhibited [3 h]-aldosterone binding
to mr in a dose dependent manner and complete inhibition was
achieved at 1 and 10 ␮m respectively for  xxxd3372xxx  and 4 - xxxd3372xxx 
(fig. 6b). on the contrary, the binding afﬁnities of 3-hydroxylated
compounds were very low (fig. 6b).
4. discussion
in this study, we have assessed the potential hormonal proﬁle
of  xxxd3372xxx  and its primary metabolites on all human steroid receptors (pr, ar, gr, mr, er␣ and er␤) using hela or  xxxg1682xxx  cells stably
transfected with a given receptor and a luciferase reporter gene.
we show that  xxxd3372xxx  and its 4 isomer predominantly bind and

activate pr and ar whereas 3␣ and 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  predominantly
bind and activate er␣ (table 1). the hydroxyl metabolites are full
agonists for both ers and bind preferentially er␣. the estrogenic
activity of  xxxd3372xxx  as shown here is not due to a conversion on a
potent estrogenic metabolite by aromatase as it was suggested by
bodine et al. [17] and wiegratz et al. [18] because an aromatase
inhibitor does not inﬂuence the percentage of activation at different  xxxd3372xxx  concentrations. in contrast, testosterone shows a clear
effect of the aromatase inhibitor conﬁrming that these cells contain the aromatase enzyme. the estrogenic activity of  xxxd3372xxx  is
therefore not dependent on aromatization. it is also not possible
that the estrogenic activity of  xxxd3372xxx  as shown here and by others
[10] is due to direct binding to ers, because  xxxd3372xxx  does not contain the required hydroxyl-group. our data demonstrating that 3␣and 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  have a better afﬁnity for er␣ than  xxxd3372xxx 
and its 4 derivative are consistent with previous studies showing that compounds with a 3 keto 4 conﬁguration do not bind

to er and require at least a 3 hydroxyl group [19]. most likely the
cell lines contain aldo-ketoreductases, which can convert  xxxd3372xxx 
to the 3-hydroxymetabolites [20]. larrea et al. [21] have shown
that 19-nortestosterone derived progestagens can be converted to
a-ring reduced metabolite, which are agonists for er␣.
 xxxd3372xxx  and its 4 metabolite are relatively strong agonists
for ar. the effect of  xxxd3372xxx  on androgen sensitive parameters is
often thought to be contributed to the 4 metabolite of  xxxd3372xxx .
however, verheul et al. [22] have shown that  xxxd3372xxx  and the 4
metabolite are present in target tissues in very low concentration,
except in the liver. the direct androgenic effects of  xxxd3372xxx  and 4
metabolite has therefore little impact on target tissues. the possible androgenic effect in  xxxd3372xxx  users on libido [23] may well
be explained by the observed decreased levels of shbg, which

cause increased levels of free testosterone [24]. surprisingly the 3␤oh- xxxd3372xxx  stimulates the ar and this stimulation increases with
prolonged incubation times. this indicates that the 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx 
is most likely metabolized to the 4 metabolite. similarly, schatz et
al. have shown in human stromal cells that 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  stimulates progesterone sensitive parameters and they suggested that
this can be explained by the presence of aldo-ketoreductases of
which have been shown that they can convert 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx  to
4 metabolite [20]. the anti-androgenic activity of the 3␣-ohtibolone is weak and occurs only at very high concentrations.
as shown by binding and transactivation experiments pr, gr
and mr bind preferentially  xxxd3372xxx  and its 4 metabolite than
3␣- and 3␤-oh- xxxd3372xxx . furthermore, 3-hydroxymetabolites were
antagonists on these three receptors while  xxxd3372xxx  and its 4
metabolite were agonists for pr. this is due to the fact that these
receptors bind preferentially and are activated by 3-keto steroids
[19]. the antagonism of  xxxd3372xxx  and 4 isomer on gr (low) and
mr (moderate) might be due to the absence of hydroxyl in position
11. several studies showed that the presence of 11␤-hydroxyl substitute on different mr and gr agonist ligands is required to adopt
a conformation competent for ligand binding and is critical for stabilizing the active receptor conformation [25–27]. a role of the 17hydroxyl group is also possible. takeda et al. [28] demonstrated,
using several mutant mrs, that the contact of 17␤-hydroxyl group
of androgens with the asn 770, cys942 and thr945 residues of the
ligand binding cavity of the mr stabilize binding complexes but is
unable to stabilize the receptor in active state. the same group has
also shown that 17␣-oh-progesterone has a lower afﬁnity than progesterone for the mr but a much lower mineralocorticoid agonist
activity and expresses antagonistic activity [29]. whether  xxxd3372xxx 
and its 4 metabolite are able to disrupt the complex ligand–mr
contacts in the loop l11–12 and helix 12 region leading to anti
mineralocorticoid action [25] needs further investigations. however, the ic50 s of  xxxd3372xxx  and the 4 metabolite to the mr are far
higher that that is seen for progesterone [29] and a clinical effect is
therefore unlikely.
in conclusion,  xxxd3372xxx  by these actions on different receptors
and by this capacity to transform in different metabolites, has more
complex effects than initially supposed.
