summary regulation of the hair cycle takes place at the pilo-sebaceous unit with the sebaceous gland as a sex
hormone-dependent part.
although minoxidil stimulates proliferation of follicular cells and activation of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1,
it was suggested that other mechanisms, such as an increase in the local blood flow, might mediate the drug effect on
hair growth. if that is the case, it is possible that minoxidil counteracts some vasoconstrictive mediator of male-pattern
alopecia.
this hypothetical vasoconstrictive mediator x would have to meet some criteria: (i) vasoconstriction both in the
general circulation and in the hair-growing skin; (ii) local vasoconstrictive activity in the hair growing skin should be
related to the circulating testosterone level; (iii) only an increase in the local mediator x activity causes male-pattern
alopecia, since hypertensive patients are not balder than expected.
the sebaceous gland is a possible place of the mediator x secretion since it is a sex-hormone-dependent part of the
pilo-sebaceous unit. et-1 might be a suitable candidate for the mediator x, since male hormones raise et-1 plasma
levels and female hormones lower them.
the speculation presented here is that et-1, beside vasoconstriction in the general circulation, might also regulate
the sebum secretion, by triggering contractions of the myoepithelial cells. this hypothetical mechanism would normally
remain confined to the sebaceous gland. during puberty, sex hormones stimulate growth of sebaceous glands in both
sexes. in women hypertrophied sebaceous glands under estrogen control would not increase its et-1 content, while in
men, testosterone would increase et-1 secretion that might affect the neighboring arterioles. induced vasoconstriction
might reduce the hair growth and promote hair loss.
if et-1 plays the described role, then an et-1 antagonist, i.e. bosentane, should also have some hair-growing
properties. © 1999 harcourt publishers ltd
introduction
regulation of the hair cycle takes place at the pilosebaceous unit under the control of igf-1, tgfalpha, hgf,
egf, androgens, il-1 and k+ channel openers such as
minoxidil (1). the sebaceous gland is a sex hormone

dependent part of the pilo-sebaceous unit (2). in cats,
testosterone controls sebaceous cells’ and glands’ volume
(3). the sebum secretion itself seems unrelated to the
plasma hormone levels of cortisol, melatonin, delta-4androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, and
free testosterone (4). the local mediators probably
regulate the circadian rhythm under which changes the
number of secreting follicles on the forehead (4).
 xxxd1781xxx , as a hipertrichotic drug (5), influences
both parts of the pilo-sebaceous unit. beside the hypertrichotic effect, it induces sebaceous hyperplasia in heart
transplant recipients (6) and in a patient under immunosuppressive therapy (7).

minoxidil and male-pattern alopecia

minoxidil is an antihypertensive drug with a known
hypertrichotic effect (8). it acts as an opener of atpsensitive k+ channels in vascular smooth muscle (9).
although minoxidil stimulates proliferation of follicular
cells (10) and activation of prostaglandin endoperoxide
synthase-1 (11), other experimental data suggest that
minoxidil induced openings of k+ channels do not occur
in hair follicles (12). the authors suggested that other
mechanisms, such as an increase in the local blood flow,
might mediate the drug effect on hair growth (12).

if we can attribute the effect of minoxidil on hair growth
to its local vasodilatatory action, then it is possible that
minoxidil counteracts some vasoconstrictive mediator of
male-pattern alopecia.
we can describe this hypothetical mediator x with the
following criteria:

it is speculated here that the hypothetical vasoconstrictive mediator x might regulate sebum secretion, by
triggering contractions of myoepithelial cells. this hypothetical mechanism would normally remain confined to
the sebaceous glands, as shown in figure 1a.
during puberty, sex hormones stimulate growth of
sebaceous glands in both sexes (fig. 1b & 1c). in women,
hypertrophied sebaceous glands under estrogen control
would contain normal amounts of mediator x (fig. 1b),
while in men, testosterone would induce an increase in
the mediator x secretion. excessive amounts of mediator
x might spill out from the sebaceous glands and affect the
neighboring arterioles (fig. 1c). induced vasoconstriction
would reduce the hair growth and promote hair loss.

characteristics of the hypothethical
vasoconstrictive mediator of malepattern alopecia

mediator x produces vasoconstriction both in the
general circulation and in the hair-growing skin, since
minoxidil produces vasodilatatory effects on both
levels.
ii. the local activity of the mediator x in the hairgrowing skin is presumably related to the testosterone level, suggesting the testosterone dependent
sebaceous gland as a possible place of the mediator x
secretion.
iii. only an increase in the local mediator x activity
causes male-pattern alopecia, since hypertensive
patients are not balder than expected.

paracrine manner and on the endothelium in an
autocrine manner (13). it stimulates contraction in the
perfused rat liver and causes increases in portal pressure
(14). induced vasoconstriction may result in cholestasis
(15). et-1 and  xxxd2738xxx  seem to regulate the liver
vascular tone in the presence of ethanol (16).  xxxd2738xxx 
synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells is inhibited in
the presence of et-1 (17). et-1 is a splenic arterial vasoconstrictor (18) and a regulator of pancreatic tissue blood
flow (19), causing pancreatic microcirculatory disturbance that might lead to the aggravation of acute pancreatitis (20). increased bone growth is often in patients with
the et-1 secreting metastatic bone lesions of prostate
cancer (21,22).

kurbel et al.

production of et-1 affects the development of chronic
heart failure (23). it stimulates the ace activity in the rat
aortic smooth muscle cells (24). increased plasma
endothelin levels in patients with congestive heart failure
appear to serve as a predictor of cardiac death (25). ace
inhibitors and angiotensin receptor type 1 antagonists
induce regression of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy
and of cardiac fibrosis (26), with the reduction of elevated
et-1 levels (27).
the extracellular matrix accumulation in the cardiovascular system plays a role in the development of heart
failure after myocardial infarction and hypertension, and
in vascular hypertrophy and restenosis (26). et-1 stimulates collagen synthesis in the coronary artery vascular
smooth muscle (28). in cardiac fibroblasts, et-1 increases
collagen synthesis and reduces collagenase activity (29).
et-1 plays a role in the extent and distribution of fibrosis
in diseases with the overproduction of it (30).
on the other hand, minoxidil inhibits collagen
formation and may be useful in delaying surgical woundhealing (31). it has antiproliferative, lysyl-hydroxylasesuppressing effects (32,33) and inhibits contraction of the
collagen lattices (34). minoxidil inhibits the proliferation
of smooth muscle cells in the proliferating phase, but not
in the quiescent phase where it stimulates elastin
synthesis (35). rats with a minoxidil induced volume
overload of the left ventricle have a decreased accumulation of the heart collagen (36) and an increased elastin
accumulation after four weeks of overload (37).
minoxidil stimulates elastin expression in chick skin
fibroblasts (38).
et-1, able to increase both cytosolic and nuclear
calcium levels, may serve as a putative modulator of
erectile dysfunction (39,40), while minoxidil is used in the
treatment of selected cases of impotence (41,42).
 xxxg674xxx  as a hypothethical
vasoconstrictive mediator of malepattern alopecia
 xxxg674xxx  (et-1) is a suitable candidate for this hypothetical vasoconstrictive mediator x of male-pattern
alopecia, since nitrates, inhibitors of the angiotensinconverting enzyme (ace), calcium channel blockers,
agonists and blockers of adrenergic receptors, do not
show hypertrichotic properties.
let us see how et-1 meets the proposed criteria for the
hypothetical vasoconstrictive mediator x of male-pattern
alopecia.
i.

the presence of et-binding sites in epidermis and
hair follicles suggests a possible mitogenic function
for endothelin in human skin (43). mast cells
synthesize and secrete et-1, and have et receptors,

medical hypotheses (1999) 53(5), 402–406

suggesting that et-1 may participate in mediating
mast cell-related long-term changes in the
microenvironment including smooth muscle tone, or
the proliferation rate of fibroblasts (10). in mice and
humans, mutations in the gene encoding the type b
endothelin receptor produce pigment abnormalities
(44). furthermore, et-1 plays a role in the pathology
of dermal fibrosis and vasoconstriction (45). systemic
sclerosis is characterized by increased plasma et-1
levels (46), higher in patients with diffuse systemic
sclerosis than in limited systemic sclerosis (47).
ii. in a group of 23 healthy men, 29 healthy women, 20
pregnant women, and 12 male-to-female and 13
female-to-male transsexual patients, plasma levels of
endothelin showed that sex hormones modulate
plasma endothelin levels, with male hormones raising
levels and female hormones lowering them (48). a
cardioprotective effect of circulating oestrogen
appears responsible for the decrease in
cardiovascular mortality in women. oestrogen can
enhance  xxxd2738xxx  (no) production by the
vascular endothelium (49), while the oestrogen
replacement therapy stimulates the production of
vasoprotective prostacyclin without a concomitant
change in et-1 release (50).
iii. experimental data linking local production of
endothelins in sebaceous glands of the hair-growing
skin to the sex, age or hormonal status of patients,
are lacking. in histologically related breast glands,
et-1 secretion was detected in breast cancer cell
lines (51) and in breast tumors (52).
possible conclusion is that minoxidil in male-pattern
alopecia might interfere with the testosterone induced
overproduction of a vasoconstrictive mediator in the pilosebaceous unit. if et-1 plays that role, then an et-1
antagonist, i.e. bosentane (53), should also have some
hair-growing properties.
