 xxxg1748xxx -deficient mice are protected from  xxxd2401xxx -induced heart failure.  we have recently shown that genetic inactivation of  xxxg1748xxx  ( xxxg1748xxx ), the isoform linked to g-protein-coupled receptors, results in increased cardiac contractility with no effect on basal cell size. signaling via the g-protein-coupled beta-adrenergic receptors has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, suggesting that  xxxg1748xxx  might play a role in the pathogenesis of heart disease.
