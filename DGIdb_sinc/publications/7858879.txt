previous studies suggested that endothelin-l (et-1) may play a role in myocardial ischaemia and
reperfusion. this study was designed to test the effect of a new nonpeptide antagonist of endothelin eta
and etb receptors,  xxxd358xxx , on myocardial infarct size, ventricular arrhythmias, and coronary
endothelial dysfunction after ischaemia and reperfusion.
2 anaesthetized male wistar rats were subjected to 20 min ischaemia (left coronary artery occlusion)
followed by 1 h (for the evaluation of coronary endothelial dysfunction) or 2 h (for the evaluation of
infarct size) reperfusion, or 5 min ischaemia followed by 15 min reperfusion (for the evaluation of
reperfusion arrhythmias). vascular studies were performed on 1.5-2 mm coronary segments (internal
diameter 250-300 ftm) removed distal to the site of occlusion and mounted in wire myographs for
isometric tension recording. area at risk and infarct size were determined by indian ink injection and
triphenyl tetrazolium staining, using computerized analysis of enlarged sections after colour video

acquisition.

3  xxxd358xxx , administered at a dose which virtually abolished the pressor response to big et-1
(3 mg kg-', i.v. before ischaemia) did not affect heart rate, arterial pressure or the rate pressure product
before ischaemia, during ischaemia and during reperfusion.  xxxd358xxx  did not affect the incidence of
reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (controls: 86%, n = 14;  xxxd358xxx : 93%, n = 15), and did not
modify infarct size (% of area at risk: controls: 63 ± 4, n = 10;  xxxd358xxx : 60 ± 6, n = 8). ischaemia
followed by reperfusion markedly reduced the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine
(maximal response: sham: 59 + 4%, n = 9; ischaemia-reperfusion: 26± 6%, n = 8; p<0.01), characteristic of reperfusion-induced endothelial dysfunction, and this dysfunction was not prevented by
 xxxd358xxx  (maximal response to acetylcholine: 25 ± 5%, n = 9; p<0.01 vs sham; p = ns vs ischaemia/
reperfusion).
4 these experiments suggest that endogenous endothelin does not contribute to myocyte or coronary
endothelial injury in this rat model of ischaemia and reperfusion.

introduction
vascular endothelial cells synthesize various vasoactive substances, including  xxxg674xxx  (et-1), a 21 amino acid
vasoconstrictor peptide. several experiments have suggested
that et-1 is released in basal conditions (ando et al., 1989;
suzuki et al., 1989), and that this release is increased in
various pathophysiological conditions, including myocardial
ischaemia or infarction (miyauchi et al., 1989; 1992; yasuda
et al., 1990; stewart et al., 1991; tsuji et al., 1991; watanabe
et al., 1991a; vemulapalli et al., 1992; lechleitner et al., 1993;
qiu et al., 1993; donckier et al., 1994). et-1 increases cardiac contractility (shah et al., 1989; shomisch moravec et al.,
1989) and induces coronary constriction (tippins et al.,
1989), leading to myocardial ischaemia (ezra et al., 1989;
larkin et al., 1989; hori et al., 1991) or arrhythmias
(yorikane & koike, 1990; salvati et al., 1991). furthermore,
ischaemia can induce an externalization of et-1 receptors in
rat cardiac membranes (liu et al., 1990), and the response of
rat isolated hearts to endothelin is increased during ischaemia
and reperfusion (nebauer et al., 1990; 1991). thus, based on
those data, it is tempting to speculate that endogenous
release of et-1 may aggravate myocardial ischaemia, either
through coronary constriction or through direct myocardial
effects. this hypothesis has been difficult to test directly, due
to the absence of specific antagonists of endothelin receptors.
recent studies, however, have suggested that monoclonal
antibodies directed against et-1, or  xxxd2936xxx  (an
author for correspondence.

inhibitor of endothelin converting enzyme) could reduce
ischaemic damage in experimental models of myocardial
ischaemia and reperfusion in rats (watanabe et al., 1991a;
grover et al., 1992).
two receptor subtypes, eta and etb mediate the biological effects of endothelin (arai et al., 1990; sakurai et al.,
1990). although it was initially assumed that eta receptors
were present on vascular smooth muscle and induced
vasoconstriction, whereas etb receptors were present on vascular endothelium and mediated the vasodilator effect of
endothelin (sakurai et al., 1992), recent experiments showed
that etb receptors are in fact also present on smooth muscle
cells and contribute to the vasoconstrictor effect of endothelin; indeed, in rats (mcmurdo et al., 1993; bird et al., 1993),
as well as in isolated arteries (seo et al., 1994) the eta
antagonists bq-123 and fr-139317 are unable to antagonize
fully the vasoconstrictor effect of  xxxg674xxx , suggesting
that part of this response could be due to stimulation of
smooth muscle cell etb receptors. thus, the physiological
and pathophysiological effects of endogenous endothelin can
be evaluated best through inhibition of both eta and etbmediated responses.
 xxxd358xxx  ( xxxd358xxx ) is a novel, non peptide, orally
active et-1 antagonist (clozel et al., 1994) derived from
ro46-2005, a previously described et-1 antagonist (clozel
et al., 1993a,b). in vitro,  xxxd358xxx  binds competitively to
both human eta and etb receptors, and inhibits the eta
and etb-mediated responses of isolated arteries (clozel et al.,
1994). in vivo, this compound inhibits the pressor and depres-

v. richard et al.

sor responses induced by intravenous administration of et-1,
big et-1, or sarafotoxin s6c, also suggestive of antagonism
at both eta and etb receptors (clozel et al., 1994). thus,
this compound represents a new tool to investigate the role
of endogenous endothelin in physiological and pathophysiological situations. indeed, preliminary data suggest that
 xxxd358xxx  decreases arterial pressure in various experimental
models of hypertension (clozel et al., 1993c) and reverses
cerebral vasospasm in subarachnoid haemorrhage, a situation
associated with a marked increase in endothelin release
(roux et al., 1993).
thus, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the
effect of  xxxd358xxx  in a rat model of myocardial ischaemia
followed by reperfusion. specifically, the effect of  xxxd358xxx 
was investigated on three major aspects of ischaemia/reperfusion injury: infarct size, reperfusion-induced arrhythmias
and reperfusion-induced coronary endothelial dysfunction.

methods

general animal preparation
the experimental protocol was similar to that described
previously (richard et al., 1993; 1994). the study was performed in 96 male wistar rats (charles river, saint aubin
les elbeuf, france), weighing between 300 and 400 g, which
were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone, 40mgkg-'
intraperitoneally. a midline incision was made in the neck
and a tracheotomy performed. the rats were mechanically
ventilated with room air supplemented with low flow oxygen
using small rodent ventilators (apelex, massy, france or
mdi, mobile, al, u.s.a.), at a rate of 60 cycles min' and
a tidal volume of 10 ml kg-' body weight. the respiratory
rate and tidal volume were adjusted in order to maintain
arterial blood gases within a normal range. body temperature
was maintained at 37tc with a thermostated heating blanket
connected to a rectal thermometer. the right jugular vein
was cannulated for injection of drugs and of indian ink for
the delineation of area at risk (see below). the left carotid
artery was cannulated, and a small millar mikrotip catheter
(model spr407, millar, houston, tx, u.s.a.) was inserted
in the artery in order to measure arterial blood pressure. an
electrocardiogram was also obtained with standard limb electrodes. a left thoracotomy was performed, and the heart
exposed. a 7/0 polypropylene suture was passed around the
proximal left coronary artery and the ends were passed
through a small plastic tube to form a snare. the artery was
occluded by pulling the snare, which was kept in place by
means of a haemostatic clamp. myocardial ischaemia was
confirmed by visual cyanosis. reperfusion was induced by
releasing the snare.

effect of  xxxd358xxx  on the pressor response to big
endothelin in ganglion-blocked rats
experiments were performed in 13 rats (7 controls, 6  xxxd358xxx ). rats were anaesthetized, ventilated and instrumented as
described above, but the chest was not opened. the animals
were allowed to rest for 15 min after completion of the
surgical preparation, after which they received the ganglion
blocking agent, chlorisondamine (2.5 mg kg-', i.v.). fifteen
min after chlorisondamine, rats received  xxxd358xxx  (ro 470203, 3 mg kg-') or saline, given as an 0.2 ml i.v. bolus.
fifteen min after  xxxd358xxx , the animals received increasing
doses of big endothelin (0.01-1 nmol kg-'). ecg and heart
rate were monitored continuously on a gould windowgraph
recorder (gould, ballainvilliers, france). pressor effects of
big endothelin were assessed 15 min after administration of
each dose.

effect of  xxxd358xxx  on infarct size
experiments were performed in 20 rats (10 controls and 10
 xxxd358xxx ). rats were assigned to two groups, which were
subjected to a 20 min coronary occlusion followed by
120min reperfusion.  xxxd358xxx  was given as an 0.2ml i.v.
bolus (3 mg kg-') 15 min before ischaemia. in these experiments, ecg and arterial pressure were monitored continuously on a gould es2000 recorder. the methods for
quantitating infarct size were similar to those used in our
previous studies (richard et al., 1993; 1994). at the end of
the 120 min reperfusion period, the artery was briefly reoccluded, and 0.7ml indian ink was injected slowly into the
jugular catheter, in order to delineate the area at risk of
infarction. the heart was excised, the right ventricle and the
atria were dissected away with small surgical scissors, and the
remaining left ventricle was frozen in cold isopentane and
kept in isopentane at -10c for i h. we have previously
verified that this freezing procedure does not affect histochemical determination of necrosis as compared to fresh
tissue (richard et al., 1993). the frozen ventricle was then
sliced from apex to base into 7-8 sections. after thawing,
the slices were immersed in 1% triphenyletrazolium chloride
(ttc, sigma chimie) in ph 7.4 phosphate buffer for 20 min
at 37°c, in order to delineate the infarcted tissue. the sections were then fixed in 10% phosphate buffered-formalin at
room temperature for a minimum of 4 days. after fixation,
each section was weighed and placed under a microscopic
video camera (microwatcher vs-30h, mitsubishi kasei corporation, tokyo, japan) with a 20 fold enlargement lens. the
camera was connected to an electronic colour digitalisation
card (matrox illuminator 16) coupled to an ast computer.
the digitized colour images were enlarged 5 fold (final
enlargement 100 fold), and the resulting images were stored
as bitmap files for later analysis. these stored images were
later displayed on a 1024 x 768 pixel colour screen using a
windows-based image analysis software (cyberview, cervus
int., france), and the area (mm2) of nonischaemic (indian,
ink stained), viable (ttc positive) and infarcted (ttc
negative) tissue were determined on each section using the
same image analysis software. from these measurements,
infarct and area at risk weights were calculated knowing the
individual weight of each section. the size of the area at risk
was then expressed as a percentage of left ventricular weight,
and infarct size was expressed as a percentage of the left
ventricle and as a percentage of the area at risk.

effect of  xxxd358xxx  on reperfusion-induced arrhythmias
experiments were performed in 29 rats (14 controls and 15
 xxxd358xxx ). animals were subjected to a 5 min coronary occlusion (corresponding to the duration of ischaemia for which
the incidence of reperfusion arrhythmias is the highest) followed by 15 min reperfusion. we verified in pilot experiments
that no severe arrhythmias occurred in this model after the
first 15 min of reperfusion.  xxxd358xxx  was given as a 0.2 ml
i.v. bolus (3 mg kg- ') 15 min before ischaemia. ecg and
heart rate were monitored continuously on a gould windowgraph recorder. the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia
and fibrillation (reversible and irreversible) during ischaemia
and reperfusion was detected on the electrocardiogram and
the blood pressure tracing; ventricular tachycardia was detectable on the ecg signal, whereas fibrillation was detectable
both on the ecg and as a complete absence of arterial
pressure.

effect of  xxxd358xxx  on reperfusion-induced coronary
endothelial dysfunction
experiment were performed in 34 rats, which were assigned
to three groups: group 1 rats (sham, n = 10) were killed after
a 100 min open-chest period without occlusion of the artery;
group 2 rats (ischaemia/reperfusion, n = 12) were subjected

to a 20 min coronary occlusion followed by 60 min reperfusion; group 3 rats ( xxxd358xxx , n = 12) were subjected to the
same 20 min coronary occlusion/60 min reperfusion cycle as
in group 2, but received  xxxd358xxx  given as a 0.2 ml i.v. bolus
(3 mg kg-') 15 min before ischaemia.
coronary endothelial dysfunction was assessed as described previously (richard et al., 1994). at the end of the
experiment, the heart was removed and immediately placed
in cold, oxygenated physiological saline (control solution) of
the following composition (mm): nacl 118.3, kci 4.7, caci2
2.5, nahco3 25,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, kh2po4 1.2, edta 0.02 and
glucose 11.1. the left coronary artery was carefully dissected
free under a dissecting microscope. segments of the artery
(length 1.5-2 mm; internal diameter 250-300 pm) were
taken distal to the occlusion site and mounted in a small
vessel myograph for isometric tension recording (jp trading,
aarhus, denmark). for this purpose, the segments were
threaded into two 40 gum stainless steel wires; the ends of the
wires were then fastened to two stainless steel support blocks
(mulvany & halpern, 1977). one block was mounted on a
tension transducer and the other on a displacement device
operated by a micrometer. care was taken during the dissection procedure to avoid damage to the endothelium. during
the mount process, the myograph chamber was filled with
cold, oxygenated (95% 02:5% c02, ph 7.4) control solution.
vessel length was measured with a calibrated lens placed in
the dissection microscope. after equilibration, the vessel was
progressively stretched using the micrometer; the internal
circumference of the vessel was calculated from the micrometer reading and the corresponding force was read on the
recorder. wall tension was calculated for each level of stretch
by dividing this reading by vessel length. from these
measurements, the laplace law was used to calculate the
effective pressure (which corresponds to the pressure that
would be necessary to extend the vessel to the measured
internal circumference), as: effective pressure = wall tension x 211/internal circumference (mulvany & halpern, 1977).
the distension was stopped when effective pressure exceeded 100 mmhg. the relation between effective pressure and
internal circumference was then fitted to an exponential
curve, and the circumference of the vessel corresponding to a
transmural pressure of 100 mmhg (icoo) was calculated
from the fitted curve. the vessel was then set to a circumference equal to 0.9 x icoo, which corresponds to the
circumference for which the active concentration is maximal
(mulvany & halpern, 1977). after mounting, the vessels were
allowed to equilibrate for 30min, during which chamber
temperature was progressively increased to 37°c.
after another 60 min equilibration period during which the
vessels were washed, segments were exposed to increasing
concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht, i0-`- 10 m),
after which concentration-response curves to acetylcholine
(10-9-10-5m) or the no donor sin-1 (lo-8-10-4m) were
studied in each ring after precontraction by serotonin.

results

pressor response to big et-j
the effect of  xxxd358xxx  (3 mg kg-', i.v.) on the pressor response induced by increasing doses of big et-1 (0.01-1 nmol
kg-') in ganglion-blocked rats is shown in figure 1.  xxxd358xxx  was itself devoid of effect on blood pressure. in the
absence of  xxxd358xxx , big et-1 induced a dose-dependent
increase in blood pressure, the maximal increase in mean
blood pressure being 68 ± 11% at the dose of 1 nmol kg- '.
the pressor response to big et-1 was markedly reduced by
 xxxd358xxx  (maximal increase in mean blood pressure: 13 ±
6%; p<0.01 vs controls).

haemodynamics during ischaemia and reperfusion
table 1 shows the evolution with time of heart rate, systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, and rate pressure product (an
index of myocardial oxygen consumption) in the animals that
entered the infarct size study and survived the entire protocol. haemodynamic parameters were measured at baseline
(i.e. before administration of  xxxd358xxx ), immediately before
ischaemia (i.e. 15 min after administration of  xxxd358xxx ), at
the end of the 20 min period of ischaemia, and after 120 min
of reperfusion. in controls, neither ischaemia nor reperfusion
affected heart rate, blood pressure or rate pressure product.
 xxxd358xxx  did not significantly affect the haemodynamic
parameters measured at any time during the experiments,
although it tended to decrease heart rate, blood pressure and
the rate pressure product during reperfusion.

area at risk and infarct size
out of the 20 animals which entered the study (10 controls
and 10  xxxd358xxx ), one  xxxd358xxx -treated rat died of ventricular fibrillation during ischaemia and one had to be excluded because of technical difficulties. results on infarct size
were thus obtained in 18 animals (10 controls and 8  xxxd358xxx ). figure 2 summarizes the area at risk and infarct size

regional ischaemia, was not significantly different in the two
groups (controls: 51 ± 2%;  xxxd358xxx  49 ± 6% of left ventricle). as compared to controls,  xxxd358xxx  did not affect infarct
size, whether expressed as a percentage of left ventricle (controls: 32 + 2;  xxxd358xxx  31 ± 6%; figure 2), or as a percentage of the area at risk (controls: 63 ± 4%; range 48-85%;
 xxxd358xxx  60 ± 6%; range 38-83%; figure 2).

reperfusion arrhythmias
figure 3 shows the incidence of ventricular fibrillation upon
reperfusion after a 5 min period of ischaemia in controls or
 xxxd358xxx -treated rats. in controls, reperfusion was associated
with the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation in 86% of the
animals; fibrillation was irreversible (i.e. no reversion to normal sinus rhythm during the first 15 min of reperfusion) in
21% of the animals.  xxxd358xxx  did not affect the incidence of
reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (93 and 26% of
total and irreversible fibrillation, respectively).

coronary endothelial dysfunction
out of the 34 rats that entered the study, 5 animals (2
controls and 3  xxxd358xxx ) died of ventricular fibrillation.
experiments on isolated blood vessels were then performed in
arteries taken from the 29 surviving animals (10 sham, 10
ischaemia/reperfusion controls and 9 ischaemia/reperfu-

sion +  xxxd358xxx ). responses of isolated arteries to increasing
concentrations of 5-ht or sin-1 are shown in figure 4. as
compared to sham-operated animals, neither ischaemia/reperfusion nor its treatment by  xxxd358xxx  affected the contractile
responses to 5-ht (figure 4). similarly, the endotheliumindependent relaxant response to the  xxxd2738xxx  donor sin1 was not affected by ischaemia/reperfusion or by  xxxd358xxx 
(figure 4).
responses of isolated coronary arteries to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine are shown in figure
5. in arteries taken from sham-operated animals, acetylcholine induced concentration dependent relaxations which
reached 59 ± 4% at the highest concentration (10-5 m). this
response to acetylcholine was virtually abolished by larginine analogues such as ng-nitro-l-arginine or n0- xxxd2741xxx -arginine methyl ester (data not shown). the response to
acetylcholine was markedly reduced after ischaemia and
reperfusion (figure 5; maximal response: 26 ± 6%; p<0.01
vs sham). as compared to sham-operated rats, the response
to acetylcholine was significantly reduced by ischaemia/
reperfuson at all concentrations from 3 x 10-7 m to i0-i m.
this ischaemia/reperfusion - induced impairment of
endothelium-dependent response to acetylcholine was not
affected by  xxxd358xxx  (maximal relaxation: 25± 5%; n =9;
p< 0.01 vs sham; p = ns vs ischaemia reperfusion).

discussion

a) 40oj 30-

the present study shows that a mixed eta-etb endothelin
antagonist,  xxxd358xxx , administered at a dose which virtually
abolished the pressor response to big et-1, had no effect of
infarct size, reperfusion arrhythmias or reperfusion-induced
coronary endothelial dysfunction in a rat model of ischaemia/reperfusion. these results suggest that et-1 probably
does not contribute to the postischaemic myocardial or coronary endothelial injury in this model.

in the present experiments,  xxxd358xxx  (3 mg kg-') markedly

of the pressor effect of big et-l is considered to be etamediated, but a small component is resistant to inhibition by
the eta antagonist bq-123 (mcmurdo et al., 1993) and
could be the consequence of activation of the  xxxg677xxx 
present at the level of the smooth muscle. we chose to assess
the effect of  xxxd358xxx  on the response to intravenous
administration of big et-1, rather than et-1 itself on the
basis that big et-1 mimics better than et-1 the physiological

inhibited by  xxxd2936xxx , seems to take place mainly in
the tissues (watanabe et al., 1991b), and et-1 is then
preferentially released toward the vascular smooth muscle
rather than toward the lumen (wagner et al., 1992). indeed,
the vasoconstrictor effects of big et-1 can be observed at
doses for which no increase in plasma et-1 can be detected
(teerlink et al., 1993). for this reason, i.v. administration of
et- 1 probably leads to an overestimation of the
endothelium-mediated depressor response to et- 1, which
might not be a physiologically relevant phenomenon if et-1
is preferentially released toward the vascular smooth muscle
in vivo.

effect of  xxxd358xxx  on infarct size
in the present study, we used a rat model of in vivo myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion similar to the one used in our
previous studies (richard et al., 1993; 1994). although the
rat offers numerous advantages in terms of cost and rep-

roducibility (especially because of the absence of native collaterals), the small size of the heart may be the cause of
various potential difficulties and imprecision during infarct
size quantification. in our experiments, necrosis was quantified by computerized image analysis of ventricular sections
after a 100 fold enlargement, i.e. on > 10 cm diameter
images. thus, despite the small size of the heart, we believe
that our quantification of infarct size was highly accurate.
in the present experiments, we used a short (20 min) duration of ischaemia. nevertheless, such ischaemia still resulted
in the development of large myocardial infarcts, averaging
60% of the area at risk, and this is consistent with results
from our previous studies (richard et al., 1993; 1994). it
must be noted that this duration of ischaemia is shorter than
that used in other infarct size studies performed in rats.
however, despite this shorter duration of ischaemia, infarcts
in our studies are of similar size or even larger than those
obtained by other groups (e.g. li et al., 1992; yellon et al.,
1992; liu & downey, 1992; 1993; li & kloner, 1993). the
reasons for these differences in the rate of development of
necrosis could be due in part to differences in the anaesthetics used or to differences in the strains of rats used
(wistar in the present study vs sprague-dawley in other
studies). finally, using the same experimental model, we have
been previously able to detect significant limitation of infarct
size with ischaemic preconditioning (richard et al., 1993;
1994), and with calcium antagonists such as verapamil
(unpublished data). thus, despite the development of large
infarcts, this model appears adequate to evaluate the efficacy
of potential anti-ischaemic drugs.
our infarct size studies were performed after a short (2 h)
period of reperfusion. however, it is unlikely that limiting
reperfusion to 2 h affected the outcome of the study or the
delineation of the infarcts based on tetrazolium staining.
indeed, in a previous study, we have shown that varying the
duration of reperfusion from 1 to 6 h in the same experimental model did not affect the size of the infarcts measured
by tetrazolium staining. this suggests that prolonging the
reperfusion period does not contribute to the extension of
infarct size in this model and that, despite the short duration
of reperfusion used in the present experiments, our measurements of infarct size are valid.
in the present experiments, blockade of endothelin receptors with  xxxd358xxx  did not affect infarct size. it is unlikely
that this lack of effect of  xxxd358xxx  is due to an insufficient

874

v. richard et al.

blockade of the endothelin-induced responses, since we
showed that the same dose markedly reduced the pressor
response induced by big et-i (figure 1), and we verified in
pilot experiments that this inhibitory effect of  xxxd358xxx  on
the response to big et-i persists for at least 2 h. furthermore, the half-life of  xxxd358xxx  in these conditions is known
to be at least 3 h (m. clozel, roche, basel, personal communication).
our results are in contrast to those of two other studies in
rats which reported a significant limitation of infarct size
either with a monoclonal antibody against et-1 (watanabe
et al., 1991a), or with  xxxd2936xxx  (grover et al., 1992).
it should be noted that, in both previous studies (unlike the
present study), the area at risk was not quantified, and
infarct size was expressed as a percentage of left ventricle. it
is now clearly established that the size of the area at risk is a
major determinant of infarct size in all models of regional
ischaemia (e.g. reimer et al., 1985). thus, a study on the
effect of a treatment on infarct size should include a measurement of area at risk in order to express infarct size as a
percentage of area at risk and eliminate individual variations
of infarct size due to variations in the anatomical area at risk
(schaper, 1984). furthermore, in both previous studies, the
duration of reperfusion was 24 h. it has been shown
previously that rat infarcts undergo rapid remodelling characteristic of infarct healing, such as wall thinning, increased
lumen volume and decreased infarct size secondary to scar
formation. indeed, such an early healing is already markedly
evident in 24 h old infarcts, since at this time the anatomical
area at risk is reduced by about 30% as compared to early
values (hearse et al., 1988). one consequence of this is that
any drug that can influence the rate of early infarct remodelling may give an impression of infarct size limitation when
assessed at 24 h (especially when area at risk is not
quantified), when in reality no such event may have occurred
(hearse et al., 1988). thus, differences in the duration of
reperfusion or absence of measurements of area at risk may
explain the differences between our results and those of the
two previously published studies performed in rats.
another difference between our study and that of grover
et al. (1992) relates to the drug used to inhibit the endothelin
effects. we used a specific inhibitor of endothelin receptors
which does not show any binding inhibitory activity against
various eicosanoids, ions or peptides (clozel et al., 1994). in
contrast, the study of grover et al. (1992) was performed
using  xxxd2936xxx , a metalloprotease inhibitor that
is not specific for endothelin converting enzyme but may
inhibit other metalloproteases such as  xxxg1417xxx 
ec.3.4.24.11 (turner, 1987). thus, it is possible that the
positive results obtained by grover et al. (1992) could be the
consequence of nonspecific effects of  xxxd2936xxx ,
independent of its inhibitory effect on endothelin converting
enzyme. indeed, recent experiments showed that a specific
antagonist of eta receptors, fr 139317, also did not affect
infarct size in a rabbit model of ischaemia-reperfusion
(mcmurdo et al., 1994). thus, our results confirm those of
mcmurdo et al. and extend those to etb receptors. taken
together, our results and those of mcmurdo et al. (1994)
suggest that endogenous endothelin does not contribute to
the extension of infarct size after myocardial ischaemia and

reperfusion.
one possible explanation of this lack of effect would be
that endothelin is not released in quantities sufficient to
induce deleterious effects during ischaemia and reperfusion,
or to express its pro-arrhythmic effects. although we have
not measured plasma levels of et-1 in our model, a previous
study showed a fourfold increase in plasma et-1 10 min into
reperfusion after a 1 h episode of in vivo ischaemia in rats
(watanabe et al., 1991a). in dogs, a short episode of cor-

onary occlusion (10 min) induces an even less marked increase in plasma et-1 (from 1.3 to 2.0 pm; donckier et al.,
1994). although the pro-ischaemic effects of such an increase
in plasma endothelin cannot be easily assessed, it is possible
that such moderate increases in plasma et-1 are not
sufficient to induce significant myocardial or vascular effects.

effect of  xxxd358xxx  on coronary endothelial dysfunction
in our experiments, ischaemia followed by reperfusion did
not affect the coronary response to 5-ht or to the nitric
oxide donor sin-1, but markedly reduced the response to
acetylcholine, confirming our previous results in the same
experimental model (richard et al., 1994). such an endothelial dysfunction also confirms previous results obtained in
other species (vanbenthuysen et al., 1987; dauber et al.,
1990; pearson et al., 1990a; tsao et al., 1990). moreover, we
showed previously that a similar alteration was not observed
in arteries obtained from hearts subjected to ischaemia without reperfusion (richard et al., 1994), suggesting that this
coronary endothelial dysfunction is a manifestation of reperfusion injury.
one limitation of the study is that only one endotheliumdependent vasodilator was used (acetylcholine). we attempted
to study other potential endothelium-dependent vasodilators,
i.e. adenosine di-phosphate, m2-adrenoceptor agonists, histamine and bradykinin, and found in pilot studies that none
of them induced significant endothelium-dependent relaxations. in addition, we found previously that receptor-independent, endothelium-dependent relaxations to the calcium
ionophore, a23 187, were rather weak in this preparation
(richard et al., 1994). furthermore,  xxxg2240xxx  and 5-ht,
which induce endothelium-dependent relaxations in other
species, also do not relax rat coronary arteries (nyborg &
mikkelsen, 1990; prieto et al., 1991). thus, to our knowledge, acetylcholine is the only endothelium-dependent relaxing agent active on rat isolated coronary arteries. because of
this limitation, we could not determine whether the impairment observed in the present experiment reflects a true defect
in  xxxd2738xxx  synthase activity or a specific impairment of
the transduction pathway linking muscarinic receptors to
no-synthase. such a selective impairment has already been
shown to occur in other pathological situations such as
hypercholesterolaemia or atherosclerosis, which selectively
affect gi protein-mediated transduction pathways (flavahan,
1992), and in canine experiments involving chronic reperfusion (pearson et al., 1990b). in any case, the absence of any
effect of  xxxd358xxx  on the response to acetylcholine suggests
that this compound was unable to prevent coronary
endothelial dysfunction, and thus that endogenous endothelin
probably does not contribute to reperfusion-induced coronary endothelial dysfunction in this model.
in conclusion, our results obtained in rats suggest that
administration of the mixed eta and etb endothelin
antagonist,  xxxd358xxx , at a dose which virtually abolished the
pressor response to big et-1, did not have any significant
effect of infarct size, reperfusion arrhythmias, and reperfusion-induced coronary endothelial dysfunction. these results suggest that endogenous endothelin probably does not
contribute to myocyte or coronary endothelial injury in this
model of ischaemia with reperfusion.
