8. clinical choice of ocular {3-blocker for glaucoma management

topical {3-blockers reduce the intraocular pressure (lop) by blockade of sympathetic nerve
endings in the ciliary epithelium causing a fall in aqueous humour production. two types of
topical {3-blockers are available for use in glaucoma: nonselective, which block both {31- and {32:
adrenoceptors; and cardioselective, which block only {31-receptors.
of the {3-blockers commercially available,  xxxd3377xxx ,  xxxd2467xxx ,  xxxd2623xxx  and carteolol
are nonselective, and betaxolol is cardioselective. twice-daily  xxxd3377xxx  is probably the most effective agent in lowering lop, although  xxxd2467xxx  is equally effective and can be used once
daily with little difference in effect. carteolol is used twice daily and any theoretical advantage
in diminished side effects confered by its partial {3-agonist activity compared with  xxxd3377xxx  has
not been fully substantiated.  xxxd2623xxx  is effective twice daily and does not have partial {3agonist activity. betaxolol has an effect comparable to  xxxd3377xxx  in lowering lop, but is less effective
in some patients.
{3-blockers can be used with other antiglaucoma medications, but their combined action with

epinephrine (adrenaline) is suspect, particularly in the case of the nonselective ,,-blockers, and
the effect should be assessed in patients on an individual basis. local stinging can be a problem
in some patients with betaxolol. the most serious side effects of ,,-blockers are the exacerbation
of chronic obstructive airways disease with nonselective agents and the precipitation of bronchospasm in some patients. betaxolol seems relatively free of adverse respiratory effects, although
this may be dose-related and extreme caution should still be exercised in patients with any history
of respiratory illness. because of the lower risk of precipitating side effects, betaxolol is probably
the ,,-blocker of first choice for use in glaucoma;  xxxd3377xxx  or  xxxd2467xxx  are reserved for patients
who do not respond satisfactorily to betaxolol and are quite free of respiratory disease.

1. overview of glaucoma
glaucoma is a condition of progressive visual
loss usually associated with an increase in intraocular pressure (lop). the visual loss is due to loss
of the field of vision associated with damage to the
optic nerve which is manifested clinically as cupping of the optic disc and is a sign of glaucomatous
optic neuropathy. as there is no effective specific
treatment for glaucomatous optic neuropathy, the
treatment of glaucoma involves lowering the lop
to try to stop the optic disc cupping and progressive visual field loss.
glaucomatous optic neuropathy may occur in
some susceptible individuals with an lop that is
within the normal range, but because the lop is
an important risk factor for the development of
glaucomatous optic neuropathy, the higher the lop
the greater the risk. a patient with an lop> 24mm
hg is 10.5 times more likely to develop subsequent
field loss than a patient with an lop < 16mm hg;
similarly, a patient with an lop> 30mm hg is
15.3 times more likely to develop subsequent field
loss than a patient with an lop of 21 to 25mm hg
(sommer 1989). however, elevated lop may not
be associated with optic nerve damage as in ocular
hypertension and raised lop is only one of several
risk factors (anderson 1989). age is also a risk factor for the development of glaucomatous optic
neuropathy and field loss.
glaucoma may be acute, presenting with a sudden increase in lop and a rapid development of
visual loss secondary to optic neuropathy and corneal oedema. glaucoma may also be chronic, developing insidiously at a lower lop, sometimes

even in the normal range, presumably caused by
the optic nerve being particularly susceptible to the
development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy,
which is characteristic of low tension glaucoma
(fig. 1).
glaucoma may be considered to be primary
when no specific cause can be identified, and secondary when optic neuropathy follows a high rise
in lop because of some condition in the eye, such
as inflammation, trauma or abnormal pigment in
the anterior chamber. chronic open angle glaucoma is the commonest type of primary glaucoma,
but various types of secondary glaucoma may produce chronic open angle glaucoma. closed angle
glaucoma may be either acute or chronic. acute
closed angle glaucoma is the commonest form of
acute glaucoma with rapid onset and high rise of
lop. chronic closed angle glaucoma is a form of
chronic glaucoma due to closed angle disease, but
without acute onset. low tension glaucoma is not
a feature of the secondary glaucomas (see fig. 1).
recently the importance of optic nerve head
perfusion in maintaining optic nerve function has
been emphasised (collingnon-brach 1989; pillunat
& stodtmeister 1989). there is evidence that although all ocular hypotensive drugs improve ocular circulation by lowering lop some may impair
ocular blood flow by an effect on the ocular blood
vessels themselves so that the net effect is to diminish ocular blood flow in spite of lowering lop.
the prevalence of glaucoma in the population
over 40 years of age differs between studies in different countries, but is usually < 1% (bj6rnsson
1967; graham 1978; hollows & graham 1966;
kahn et al. 1977; leske & rosenthal 1979; segal

& skwierczyilska 1967). this prevalence usually
refers to chronic open angle glaucoma and would
be somewhat higher if secondary glaucomas were
included. the prevalence of ocular hypertension,
or a raised lop without glaucomatous optic neuropathy, is much higher. the prevalence of glaucoma increases with age and has been given as 0.2%
for age 50 to 54 years and 2% for age 70 to 74 years
(vigg6sson et al. 1986). the incidence of ocular
hypertension also increases with age and can be as
high as 10% in people aged 70 to 75 years (bengtsson 1981).

2. overview of ocular (3-blockers
since the introduction of  xxxd3377xxx  maleate, topical j3-blockers used as eye drops have become the
most important therapeutic agents in the medical
treatment of glaucoma. the potency, ease of
administration on a twice-daily or even once-daily
basis, together with their relative freedom from adverse effects have all combined to make them the
most effective topical glaucoma treatment yet. unfortunately, the problem of respiratory side effects
has detracted from this otherwise outstanding record so that the ideal choice of a j3-blocker for glaucoma is not quite clear.
the systemic interactions of j3-blockers should

be borne in mind. systemic j3-blockers such as atenolol may have an additive effect when used in
the presence of topical j3-blockers and are perhaps
best avoided, particularly as they may decrease retinal perfusion. the use of j3-blockers with calcium
channel blockers may cause serious bradycardia,
particularly in the case of verapamil. however nifedipine and  xxxd2718xxx  are probably safer and because of their peripheral vasodilating effect may
actually increase retinal perfusion (gerber et al.
1990).
phillips et al. (1967) found that topical administration of the j3-blocker propranolol reduced lop.
since then many of the sympathetic j3-blockers including  xxxd2957xxx  (andreasson & jensen 1983; bonomi & steindler 1975; smith et al. 1979, 1982),
atenolol (brenkman 1978; elliot et al. 1975; phillips et al. 1977, 1978; wettrell et al. 1978) and propranolol (vale et al. 1972), have been shown to
produce a lowering of lop when used topically in
the eye. this lowering of lop occurs in response
to a blockade of j3-adrenoceptors in the ciliary epithelium which produces a fall in aqueous production.
clinically, 75 j3-blockers are currently available
for commercial use (table i). timo101, carteolol,
 xxxd2623xxx  and 1evobunolol are nonselective
j3-blockers that block both 131 and j32-receptors.

ocular ij-blockers in glaucoma management

211

betaxolol hydrochloride is a relatively selective
f1-blocker, blocking only f11-receptors (bloom et al.
1985; goldberg 1989; reiss & brubaker 1983).
the ideal ocular f1-blocker would block f1-receptors only in the eye without any effect on systemic
f1-receptors. some f1-blockers may have a partial
agonist effect which may lessen their local effect as
effective f1-blockers. ideal f1-blockers would also
possess no local anaesthetic activity or membrane
stabilising activity (james 1989) avoiding some degree of corneal anaesthesia and superficial keratopathy.

3.  xxxd3377xxx  maleate
3.1 pharmacological effects
 xxxd3377xxx  maleate was released for clinical use in
ophthalmology in 1978 after studies showed its efficacy as an ocular hypotensive agent (coakes &
brubaker 1978; sonntag et al. 1978; zimmerman
et al. 1977). it is a nonselective f1-adrenergic blocking agent which does not have specific intrinsic
sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant or
local anaesthetic membrane-stabilising activity.  xxxd3377xxx  maleate combines reversibly with the f1-adrenergic receptor, and thus inhibits the usual
stimulation of aqueous humour production that
would occur with the stimulation of that receptor.

3.2 clinical efficacy
3.2.1 effect on lop
in the normal human eye  xxxd3377xxx  results in a
13 to 48% decrease in the production of aqueous
humour (coakes & brubaker 1978) inducing a significant fall in lop (zimmerman & boger 1979).
in chronic users lop was 15% lower and flow 24%
lower during maintenance treatment than 1 month
after discontinuing  xxxd3377xxx  (schlecht & brubaker
1988). this action is similar to that of propranolol,
which is not used clinically. the much greater effect of  xxxd3377xxx  in lowering lop is probably a function of its more potent f1-blocking ability (see
table i).
 xxxd3377xxx  maleate is available in 0.25 and 0.5%
concentrations, both of which produce a significant
and persistent lowering ofiop when used topically
in the eye (ashburn et al. 1979; leblanc & krip
1981; lin et al. 1979; mishima 1982; neufeld 1979).
though there is often some loss in effect after the
initial dramatic fall in lop, a persistent effect is
still present after years of use. there have been
many reports confirming its efficacy, both immediate and long term, in the control of lop (boger
et al. 1980; david & sachs 1981; gillies et al. 1980,
1983; holmin & krakau 1982; phillips 1980; steinert et al. 1981), and even a once-daily dosage is
effective (soll 1980).
lowering raised lop with  xxxd3377xxx  has also been
shown to reduce the incidence of glaucomatous
damage to the visual field in individuals with ocular hypertension whose mean lop fell from 26.4
to 21.6mm hg (kass et al. 1989). it is well tolerated by patients, so compliance is excellent (worthen 1979), leading to an effect on lop comparable
with surgery. it has also been found to be effective
when added to existing topical medication already
in long term use (sonty & schwartz 1979). when
used topically over a long period the effect of  xxxd3377xxx  on lop persists for 2 to 4 weeks following
its withdrawal (schlecht & brubaker 1988). this
persistent effect with long term use gives a high
level of clinical safety, and is probably associated
with an accumulation of  xxxd3377xxx  in the tissue in
the eye and means that a 'missed drop' will not

212

drugs & aging 2 (3) 1992

greatly affect lop control. this makes daily use a
possibility with little fluctuation in effect; twicedaily use ensures a considerable safeguard against
poor compliance.
 xxxd3377xxx  m~y increase retinal blood flow (grunwald 1990) and slow visual field loss (collignonbrach 1989; epstein et al. 1989; kass 1989; kass
et al. 1989) although there are conflicting reports
on its effect on retinal, choroidal and optic nerve
head blood flow.

when the 2 agents are used together (cyrlin et al.
1982; frumar & mcguinness 1981; keates & stone
1981; thorson 1981). cyrlin et al. (1982) found that
a persistent additive effect on lop was only obtained if the 2 medications were used 3 hours apart.
if the 2 drugs are used together clinically it is best
to assess patients individually since some additive
effect may occur (korey et al. 1982). our experience has been that an additive effect does occur in
some patients, but not in others.

3.2.2 combination with other drugs
it is claimed that up to 30% of patients with
chronic open angle glaucoma fail to respond adequately to  xxxd3377xxx  alone (levy et al. 1985). although an additive effect is questionable if  xxxd3377xxx 
is used with epinephrine,  xxxd3377xxx  does have an
additive effect when used with other local and oral
antiglaucoma agents, particularly miotics and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. in early trials  xxxd3377xxx 
was added to existing drug regimens with significant additive effect (airaksinen 1979; ashburn et
al. 1979; boger et al. 1978; smith et al. 1980; sonty
& schwartz 1979); later reports confirmed the additive effects of  xxxd3377xxx  and pilocarpine (airaksinen
et al. 1987; h0vding & aasved 1987). the combination of a miotic with a ~-blocker is frequently
used in clinical practice and offers an opportunity
for better control of lop.
epinephrine (adrenaline) is thought to lower lop
by decreasing ciliary blood flow and may also have
some effect on aqueous humour outflow from the
eye. if these 2 drugs act at different sites (neufeld
1981), then it is possible that they will have an
additive effect in diminishing lop especially if they
are given at an interval or if  xxxd3377xxx  is added to
epinephrine therapy (thomas & epstein 1981). the
effects of using these different drugs are complex
and any additive effect of antagonistic drugs is difficult to explain except by an action at different
sites (mishima 1982). the evidence when the 2
drugs are used together clinically is difficult to interpret, some workers finding no additive effect
(korey et al. 1982; ohrstrom & pandolfi 1980) or
less effect than either drug alone (ohrstrom 1982).
there have been reports of a decrease in pressure

3.2.3 adverse effects
in most patients  xxxd3377xxx  is well tolerated with
little stinging and no effect on pupil size. it may,
therefore, be used in patients with senile cataracts
without affecting their vision while still having a
potent lop-lowering effect. the potent clinical effectiveness and freedom from immediate side effects were obvious soon after the introduction of
 xxxd3377xxx  and led to its preeminent position as the
medication of choice in glaucoma.
there were a few side effects reported when  xxxd3377xxx  was first introduced clinically (cher 1980).
possible effects include local anaesthetic activity
(van buskirk 1979,1980), superficial punctate keratopathy, as well as reduced tear secretion (bonomi et al. 1980), although clinically these are not
common. local hypersensitivity may occur as with
all topical medication, but this is not a particular
feature in the use of  xxxd3377xxx . bronchoconstriction,
cns effects and effects on pulse rate and blood
pressure have been observed. there were early reports of adverse effects necessitating withdrawal
(mcmahon et al. 1979), but these did not receive
great prominence, particularly when  xxxd3377xxx  was so
clinically effective (leblanc & krip 1981). because
it only needed to be used at most twice daily and
there was a considerable build-up of concentration
with continued medication a missed dose would
not greatly affect this concentration (schlecht &
brubaker 1988). thus patient compliance was much
less a problem than with pilocarpine, particularly
since once-daily use was still clinically effective.
 xxxd3377xxx  was found to have fewer adverse reactions
than pilocarpine (katz & berger 1981).
with continued use of  xxxd3377xxx , reports of side

ocular {3-blockers in glaucoma management

effects became more numerous with serious respiratory dysfunction being particularly worrying
(williams & ginther 1982). although these side
effects had been expected, their magnitude was
not. although the amount used clinically is small,
systemic absorption of  xxxd3377xxx  does occur, and because it will reach the pulmonary capillaries almost
directly, bronchoconstriction resulting from fhblockade may follow, exacerbating any tendency
toward chronic obstructive airways disease
(coad).
however, many reports indicated that  xxxd3377xxx 
was relatively trouble free when used in large groups
of patients. fraunfelder and barker (1984) found
that  xxxd3377xxx , the 34th most commonly prescribed
medication in the us in 1983, was associated with
over 200 reports of major respiratory reactions and
16 fatal cases of status asthmaticus in patients with
a prior history of asthma or other chronic respiratory disease. the possibility of these respiratory
side effects occurring in susceptible patients and
even in patients not known to be susceptible is the
major problem in the clinical use of this drug.
therefore, there is a need to take a careful cardiopulmonary history before prescribing  xxxd3377xxx  and
question patients with respiratory symptoms about
the use of topical ophthalmic ij-blocking agents.

4.  xxxd2467xxx 
 xxxd2467xxx  was introduced as an alternative
to  xxxd3377xxx  because it was claimed that its long duration of action would allow a once-daily dosing
(rakofsky et al. 1989; silverstone et al. 1991; wandel et al. 1986) with the possibility offewer adverse
effects. since it is a nonselective ij-blocker like  xxxd3377xxx  (see review by gonzalez & clissold 1987),
it is unlikely to have much advantage as far as side
effects are concerned, however once-daily administration may improve patient compliance.  xxxd2467xxx  has an ocular hypotensive effect roughly
equivalent to that of  xxxd3377xxx  (bensinger et al. 1985;
berson et al. 1985; boozman et al. 1988; cinotti et
al. 1985; long et al. 1985; savelsbergh-fillette &
demailly 1988; seam one et al. 1988; silverstone et
al. 1991). however, it does not have any more clear-

213

cut additive effect than  xxxd3377xxx  if used with epinephrine (allen et al. 1988). the  xxxd2467xxx  study
group (1985) compared it very favourably with  xxxd3377xxx , but used a twice-daily dosage as did duzman et al. (1982); a later report (1989) from the
 xxxd2467xxx  study group confirmed this earlier
work. long et al. (1988) found it to be more effective than  xxxd3377xxx . there is no reason to believe
that  xxxd2467xxx  is any safer than  xxxd3377xxx .
there have been reports of difficulties with the
use of  xxxd2467xxx  similar to those with the use of
 xxxd3377xxx  in patients with respiratory difficulties
(long et al. 1985). thus, caution is necessary in
using either of these drugs in patients with a history of respiratory disease.

5.  xxxd2623xxx 
 xxxd2623xxx  is another nonselective ij-blocker
structurally related to  xxxd3377xxx , propranolol and  xxxd2467xxx . it has no intrinsic sympathomimetic
activity or membrane stabilising properties and only
slight local anaesthetic activity. it lowers lop in
healthy volunteers (berlin et al. 1987) and ocular
hypertensives (serle et al. 1991). it produces a
comparable reduction in lop to  xxxd3377xxx  0.25 to
0.5% (merte et al. 1983; mills & wright 1986) and
 xxxd2467xxx  0.5 to 1% (krieglstein et al. 1987; stryz
& merte 1985) in eyes with glaucoma. metipran0101 0.1 % twice daily has been found to be as effective as twice daily  xxxd3377xxx  0.25% and may have
fewer side effects at this lower concentration
(schmitz-valckenberg et al. 1984). additional long
term trials are required to further assess its long
term safety and efficacy.  xxxd2623xxx  has been associated with granulomatous anterior uveitis and
multidose  xxxd2623xxx  in 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6%
strengths has been withdrawn from clinical use in
the united kingdom (akingbehin & villada 1991).

6. carteolol
carteolol is a nonselective ij-blocker with some
partial ij-agonist activity (see review by chrisp &
sorkin 1992). it is possible that this sympathomimetic activity may minimise results of systemic

drugs & aging 2 (3) 1992

214

(j-blockade such as the reduction in heart rate and
the production of bronchospasm.
topical carteolol has been shown to produce a
significant reduction in lop in glaucoma patients
(duff & grahaq1 1988; schnaudigel et al. 1988),
but in one study 12 hours after carteolol administration the reduction in lop was significantly less
than that obtained after  xxxd3377xxx  administration
(duff & newcombe 1988). another study found no
significant difference from  xxxd3377xxx  in its ability to
lower lop, but did find that it reduced exerciseinduced tachycardia to the same extent as or more
than  xxxd3377xxx  (brazier & smith 1988). thus is seems
unlikely that the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of carteolol will confer any protection from the
systemic side effects of nonselective (j-blockade, although we found no reports of bronchospasm. its
hypotensive effect in secondary glaucomas has been
shown (ohno et al. 1989).
carteolol may reduce critical perfusion pressure
of the optic nerve head (pillunat & stodtmeister
1989) but collignon-brach (1989) found that it may
increase retinal blood flow and slow progression of
visual field loss.
it would appear that carteolol offers no demonstrable advantage over  xxxd3377xxx  and is unlikely to
have any greater degree of safety.

7. betaxolol hydrochloride
7.1 pharmacological effects
betaxolol hydrochloride is a lipid-soluble (ji adrenergic antagonist which is relatively cardioselective, but this cardioselectivity is highly dose-dependent (lertora et al. 1975). it has no partial
agonist activity (boudot et al. 1979), and has little
or no local anaesthetic (membrane-stabilising) activity (cavero & lerevre-borg 1983) [table i]. it is
thought to reduce lop by reducing the production
of aqueous humour at the ciliary body with no effect on aqueous outflow (reiss & brubaker 1983).
betaxolol 0.5% is less toxic to regenerating corneal
epithelium in rabbits than is  xxxd3377xxx  0.5% or  xxxd2467xxx  0.5% (liu et al. 1987; trope et al. 1988),
while corneal healing rates are faster with betaxolol

and  xxxd2467xxx  than with  xxxd3377xxx  (trope et al.
1988).
as with other ocular (j-blockers, topical administration ofbetaxolol in the human eye may result
in some absorption from the conjunctival and nasopharyngeal mucosa, but systemic (j-blocking activity in rabbits is minimal - about 5% that of  xxxd3377xxx  in 1 radioreceptor assay (bloom et al. 1986).
ocular betaxolol failed to antagonise an  xxxd2398xxx  ( xxxd2401xxx )-induced increase in heart rate
in monkeys (desantis et al. 1987) and humans (le
jeunne et al. 1990).
7.2 clinical efficacy
7.2.1 effect on lop
betaxolol was introduced for clinical use in the
early 1980s and became available for general use
in europe and north american in 1985. it was
shown to have a significant ocular hypotensive action (allen et al. 1986; berrospi & leibowitz 1982;
berry et al. 1984; brogliatti et al. 1987; caldwell et
al. 1984; feghali & kaufman 1985; levy & boone
1982, 1983; levy et al. 1985; radius 1983; stewart
et al. 1986). similarly, in australia betaxolol was
available for use in selected patients before it was
released for general clinical use in august 1990 and
was confirmed to be an effective medication in
glaucoma (brooks et al. 1987). it is available as a
0.5% concentration. clinically, some workers found
betaxolol to have an lop-lowering effect roughly
equivalent to that of  xxxd3377xxx  (berry et al. 1984),
although other workers found  xxxd3377xxx  to be more
effective in some patients (allen & epstein 1982;
allen et al. 1986). betaxolol acts by suppressing
aqueous humour flow (reiss & brubaker 1983). the
drug has been reviewed recently (buckley et al.
1990).
7.2.2 combination with other drugs
betaxolol has been shown to have an additive
effect when used with other ocular hypotensive
agents, including miotics (merte & schnarr 1987;
rolle & franzone 1987) and carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors (smith et al. 1984). in a study of the long
term safety and efficacy of betaxolol, 25% of

ocular

~-blockers

in glaucoma management

patients needed adjunctive therapy (beasley et al.
1987).
theoretically, epinephrine and {1-blockers are
mutually antagonistic. studies with  xxxd3377xxx  and
epinephrine usually show little or no additive effect, although individual patients do vary and certain regimens may produce an additive effect.
however, there is evidence for an additive effect
with betaxolol and epinephrine (clark et al. 1989;
cyrlin et al. 1982; keates & stone 1981; thorson
1981; weinreb et al. 1986), and some authors found
the addition of epinephrine was more effective with
betaxolol than with  xxxd3377xxx  (allen & epstein 1986)
although we believe that there was a fall in lop in
some eyes only and patients should be assessed individually (clark et al. 1989).
this difference in the additive effects of  xxxd3377xxx 
and betaxolol is consistent with our understanding
of the mode of action of these drugs:  xxxd3377xxx  is a
nonselective {1-blocker, while betaxolol selectively
blocks {1\-receptors, leaving {12-adrenoceptors
available for epinephrine. this suggests that when
 xxxd3377xxx  is added to an existing regimen of topical
medication that includes epinephrine, there is likely
to be little additive effect whereas if betaxolol is
added, a significant additive effect is possible.
7.2.3 adverse effects
with betaxolol, as with  xxxd3377xxx , there is some
systemic effect in lowering pulse rate and blood
pressure in susceptible patients (nelson et al. 1986).
this lowering of pulse rate was found to be less
than with  xxxd3377xxx  (allen & epstein 1982; desantis
& chandler 1985; hernandez y hernandez et al.
1983). in contrast, in several studies, topical betaxolol had little effect on resting (dunn et al. 1986;
stewart et al. 1986), and exercise (atkins et al. 1985;
cervantes et al. 1986: dickstein 1989; hernandez
y hernandez et al. 1983), heart rate or blood pressure. nevertheless, betaxolol should be used with
caution in patients with cardiac arrhythmias or
other cardiac conditions. betaxolol may have some
advantage when used in patients who have experienced some adverse cns side effects with  xxxd3377xxx 
(lynch et al. 1988). insomnia, depression, hypochondriasis and hysteria, tend to be less common

215

with betaxolol than with  xxxd3377xxx  (cohn 1989). like
 xxxd3377xxx , betaxolol has no effect on pupil size (allen
et al. 1986) so that it may be used in cataract
patients.
unlike  xxxd3377xxx , there is a theoretical lack with
betaxolol of respiratory side effects (caldwell et al.
1984) and this seems to be confirmed in practice
(brooks et al. 1987, 1989; dunn et al. 1986; ofner
& smith 1987; schoene et al. 1984, 1985; van buskirk et al. 1986; vukich et al. 1985). when used in
patients with a history of respiratory disease or  xxxd3377xxx -induced bronchospasm, topical betaxolol had
no effect on vital capacity (vc), forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second
(fev\), fev\/vc and the mean midexpiratory
flow rate (brooks et al. 1989). in one study, no
statistically significant difference between betaxo101 and placebo recipients was found in the concentration of histamine necessary to produce a 15
to 20% fall in fev \ (bleckmann & dorow 1987).
however, in 85 patients with glaucoma, coad,
asthma or  xxxd3377xxx -induced bronchospasm, symptomatic pulmonary obstruction was apparent in 5
patients after 1 to 554 days betaxolol treatment with
a 2-year follow-up (weinreb et al. 1988).
there have been reports of respiratory deterioration in some patients with asthma or chronic
bronchitis after intravenously (hugues_ et al. 1983),
orally (huckauf 1983) or topically (dunn et al.
1986) administered betaxolol. the use of topical
betaxolol has also been associated with asthma and
serious respiratory events requiring hospitalisation
(nelson & kuritsky 1987), as well as episodes of
wheezing and dyspnoea (harris et al. 1986). such
episodes may be expected in patients with existing
respiratory disease even though they are not receiving any medication at all. this lower propensity for causing respiratory side effects is probably
only relative, and caution should still be exercised
in individual cases especially if there is a history
of respiratory disease; some patients have developed symptomatic pulmonary obstruction while
receiving betaxolol (weinreb et al. 1988). however, rechallenge with betaxolol in a small group
of patients with coad complaining of respiratory
symptoms with betaxolol did not show any effect

216

on pulmonary function (brooks et a1. 1989). studies with  xxxd3377xxx , betaxolol and placebo in patients
with asthmatic bronchitis (schoene et a1. 1984)
showed a significant effect on pulmonary function
tests with  xxxd3377xxx , but no effect with betaxolol or
placebo. a recent review of our patients has shown
that 17 of 24 with serious respiratory side effects
associated with  xxxd3377xxx  had used the drug for 5 or
more years before these respiratory symptoms became obvious; no previous history of respiratory
disease could be elicited in 14 of these 17 patients.
thus it cannot be assumed that the use of  xxxd3377xxx 
may be continued with complete safety in patients
who have used it without trouble for a considerable period even though they have no previous history of respiratory disease. it is possible that similar side effects may eventually appear with
betaxolol, but so far this drug has had a high level
of freedom from respiratory side effects, although
cases have occurred (berger 1987; harris et a1. 1986;
van buskirk et a1. 1987).
betaxolol produces stinging on instillation in
some patients (allen et a1. 1986; berry et a1. 1984),
but there is no effect on tear flow (feghali & kaufman 1985) so that superficial keratopathy should
be no more of a problem than with  xxxd3377xxx . collignon-brach (1989) found betaxolol, like  xxxd3377xxx ,
slowed progression of visual field loss in glaucoma.
new cardioselective ,6-blockers are undergoing
clinical development and it is likely that some of
these will become available in the next few years.

8. clinical choice of ocular (3-blocker
for glaucoma management
topical ,6-blockers are the drugs of choice in the
medical management of glaucoma.  xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd2467xxx  are rather more effective or likely to be
effective in more patients than betaxolol (table ii).
clinical choice of a topical ,6-blocker must, however, also take into account the patient's medical
condition. if there is a history of respiratory disease  xxxd3377xxx  should be avoided and betaxolol
should be used only with extreme caution; there is
no guarantee of complete safety with betaxolol if
the patient has a history of respiratory disease.

drugs & aging 2 (3) 1992

nonselective ,6-blockers, e.g.  xxxd3377xxx ,  xxxd2467xxx ,
carteolol or  xxxd2623xxx  should be reserved for
cases where there is insufficient response with betaxolol, or there is some form of reaction to betaxolol and it is neither possible to achieve satisfactory response with other topical agents nor to
proceed to laser or surgical therapy. carteolol may
have a theoretical advantage of producing less
bronchoconstriction as a result of its partial agonist
activity but this has not been substantiated. if  xxxd3377xxx  is used, it should be monitored carefully and
should be stopped if respiratory symptoms occur,
bearing in mind that these may be insidious in onset. we have found that  xxxd3377xxx  may be associated
with the onset of obstructive airways disease in
patients with no history of respiratory disease even
though they have used  xxxd3377xxx  without reporting
any adverse effects for long periods.
there is a possibility that some of the apparent
differences in side effects between specific and
nonspecific ,6-blockers are related to intrinsic patient
variability. this again stresses that all topical ,6blockers of any pharmacological subclass should be
used with caution in patients with a history of pulmonary disease (spiritus & casciari 1985). respiratory deterioration has been reported with betaxolol (see section 7.2.3), but this may also occur
in patients receiving no medication at all.
both  xxxd3377xxx  (nelson et a1. 1986) and betaxolol
(ball 1987) may slow the heart rate and cause some
fall in blood pressure, which may be serious in susceptible patients. clinically these effects are seldom
if ever a concern in patients in normal health, but
in patients receiving medication for cardiac arrhythmias the attending physician should be aware
that topical ,6-blockers are being considered.
therefore, although  xxxd3377xxx  is probably a somewhat better ocular hypotensive agent than betax0101, which has the added disadvantage of causing
more stinging on instillation in some patients, the
weight of evidence suggests a greater degree of risk
of exacerbation of coad with  xxxd3377xxx  than betax0101. over the last 4 years, we have treated over 60
patients with betaxolol, most having had serious
respiratory symptoms while on  xxxd3377xxx , although
some patients with known respiratory disease were

placed on betaxolol without trial with  xxxd3377xxx . unlike  xxxd3377xxx , we have seen no serious respiratory
complications in betaxolol recipients. since betax0101 became more generally available in australia
in august 1990, we have changed many patients
over from  xxxd3377xxx  to betaxolol. some patients have
experienced marked discomfort with stinging on
using betaxolol and in some patients lop control
has not been as good as with  xxxd3377xxx .
nevertheless, our experience leads us to believe
that even in patients with no history of respiratory
disease it is probably better to use betaxolol as the
~-blocker of first choice and to reserve  xxxd3377xxx  for
patients with a severe local reaction to betaxolol
or in whom there is clearly a better hypotensive
effect with  xxxd3377xxx . it seems unlikely that  xxxd2467xxx  will offer much advantage over  xxxd3377xxx  other
than the once-daily dosage; which is a real advantage in long term medication. caution is needed
when using  xxxd3377xxx  because of the considerable
number of patients without a previous history of
respiratory disease in our experience who developed obstructive airways disease while on long term
 xxxd3377xxx  medication. the occurrence of these cases
may be fortuitous and a similar picture may yet
emerge with betaxolol, but at present the evidence
indicates a greater level of safety from respiratory
complications with betaxolol than with  xxxd3377xxx . all
patients should be assessed carefully for their individual response to these drugs with regard to both
lop and side effects, particularly respiratory side

effects. the ophthalmologist must be careful to
watch for the development of systemic side effects
and the general practitioner should be aware that
the patient is receiving an ocular ~-blocker with
potential systemic side effects. when using topical
~-blockers in glaucoma we would again stress the
importance of a complete medical history and individual assessment of patient response.
