abstract:  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (plp) dependent enzyme that
catalyzes the decarboxylation of l-orn to putrescine, a rate-limiting step in the formation of polyamines.
the x-ray crystal structures of odc, complexed to several ligands, support a model where the substrate
is oriented with the carboxyl-leaving group buried on the re face of the plp cofactor. this binding site
is composed of hydrophobic and electron-rich residues, in which phe-397 is predicted to form a close
contact. mutation of phe-397 to ala reduces the steady-state rate of product formation by 150-fold.
moreover, single turnover analysis demonstrates that the rate of the decarboxylation step is decreased by
2100-fold, causing this step to replace product release as the rate-limiting step in the mutant enzyme.
these data support the structural prediction that the carboxyl-leaving group is positioned to interact with
phe-397. multiwavelength stopped-flow analysis of reaction intermediates suggests that a major product
of the reaction with the mutant enzyme is pyridoximine 5′-phosphate (pmp), resulting from incorrect
protonation of the decarboxylated intermediate at the c4′ position. this finding was confirmed by hplc
analysis of the reaction products, demonstrating that phe-397 also plays a role in maintaining the integrity
of the reaction chemistry. the finding that the carboxylate-leaving group is oriented on the buried side of
the plp cofactor suggests that odc facilitates decarboxylation by destabilizing the charged substrate
carboxyl group in favor of an electrostatically more neutral transition state.

 xxxg1626xxx  (odc)1 is a pyridoxal 5′phosphate (plp) dependent enzyme that catalyzes the
formation of the diamine, putrescine. this reaction is a ratelimiting step in the biosynthesis of polyamines, which are
required for cell proliferation. odc is the target of r- xxxd2430xxx  ( xxxd1972xxx ), a suicide inhibitor used to
treat african sleeping sickness (1-3), which is a fatal tropical
disease caused by infection with the parasitic protozoa
trypanosoma brucei.
plp-dependent enzymes catalyze a variety of chemical
reactions involving amino acids, including decarboxylation,
transamination, racemization, and beta- or gamma-elimination (4).
the plp cofactor promotes catalysis by stabilizing carbanionic reaction intermediates and plays a large role in the rate
acceleration achieved by these enzymes. dunathan proposed
that the specificity of the bond cleavage step for plpdependent enzymes is controlled by orientation of the scissile

bond such that it is aligned with the pi electrons of the imine
double bond and oriented perpendicular to the plp ring (5).
this hypothesis has received support from both experimental
(6-9) and computational studies (10). interactions between
the substrate and the apoenzyme are responsible for properly
orienting the substrate to promote the physiological reaction
chemistry. for the plp-dependent decarboxylases it has been
proposed that cleavage of the carboxylate leaving group
would be promoted by binding to a nonpolar environment
(11).
the proposed mechanism of decarboxylation catalyzed by
odc (figure 1) is supported both by x-ray structural analysis
(12-15) and by a number of mechanistic studies that have
addressed the roles of active site residues (13, 16-19). the
plp cofactor forms a covalent bond (internal aldimine) with
the active site lys-69 on native odc. this bond is
exchanged for an external aldimine with substrate by way
of a gem-diamine intermediate in the first steps of the
reaction. electrons from the charged substrate carboxylate
are delocalized into the plp pi system as decarboxylation
occurs. these steps are followed by protonation at cr,
hydrolysis, and product release. in wild-type odc the
protonation step is tightly controlled, and off-pathway
reactions caused by protonation at the c4′ position occur in
only 0.01% of the turnovers (13).
though a number of x-ray structures of mammalian (14,
15) and t. brucei odc [native,  xxxd1972xxx -inactivated, and
complexed to putrescine (12, 13)] have been solved, no
structure directly demonstrates the position of the substrate

figure 1: reaction mechanism of odc with l-orn. protonation at cr produces the preferred product putrescine, while protonation at c4′
generates gammaaba and pmp in a off-pathway reaction.

figure 2: model of the t. brucei odc active site bound to l-orn. the x-ray structure of t. brucei odc complexed with putrescine (pdb
id code 1f3t) was used to model the position of the carboxyl group for l-orn. the carboxylate was positioned onto the re face of the
cofactor, perpendicular to the face of the ring. residues predicted to be within 5 å of the substrate carboxylate are displayed as a stereoview.
for monomer a carbon atoms are in green, for monomer b carbon atoms are in orange, and the carbon atoms of plp and l-orn are colored
black. nitrogen atoms are in dark blue, oxygens are in red, sulfurs are in yellow, and phosphates are in brown. c360 and  xxxd361xxx  are in the
foreground relative to l-orn. these models are displayed with insightii, version 97.0 (accelrys, san diego, ca).

carboxylate in the l-isoform. possible binding positions for
the substrate carboxylate on odc are limited by the necessity
for the leaving group to be perpendicular to the plp ring
(5). the carboxylate of the substrate could potentially either
be bound on the solvent-exposed si face of the cofactor or
be buried in the active site pocket on the re face. the
available structural evidence favors the re position for the
substrate carboxylate. during inactivation of odc by
 xxxd1972xxx , decarboxylation with the loss of a fluoride anion
generates a conjugated amine (21). nucleophilic attack of
this species by cys-360 displaces the second fluoride and
generates a covalent bond with the inhibitor and a prochiral
cr center.  xxxd1972xxx  positioned with the carboxylate oriented
on the re face would generate a conjugated amine in position
for direct attack by cys-360, while the opposite orientation
would require significant rotation to be positioned for attack.
consistent with this analysis, a recently refined structure of
t. brucei odc bound to d-orn demonstrates that for this

isomer the carboxylate is oriented on the si face of plp,
thus suggesting that the l-isomer will bind on the opposite
side of the cofactor (20).
on the basis of these structural observations l-orn was
modeled into the t. brucei odc active site (figure 2). the
model predicts that the carboxylate binding site will include
several hydrophobic residues (phe-397, tyr-389, and the
hydrophobic side chain of lys-69), as well as asp-361.
neither the electrostatics nor the hydrophobic nature of these
amino acids favors the binding of the negatively charged
co2 group, suggesting that this pocket would facilitate
decarboxylation by destabilizing the ground-state structure
in favor of the more neutral transition state. to investigate
the role of hydrophobic residues in promoting decarboxylation, the f397a mutant of t. brucei odc was studied by
steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic methods. single
turnover analysis suggests that the mutation significantly
lowers the rate of the decarboxylation step and that, unlike

biochemistry, vol. 42, no. 10, 2003 2935

for the wild-type enzyme, this step is now rate limiting. these
data establish a role for phe-397 in promoting the chemistry
of the decarboxylation step, supporting the hypothesis that
odc binds the leaving group on the re face of the cofactor.
in addition, the mutant enzyme is no longer capable of
maintaining strict reaction specificity, and 34% of the
decarboxylation events result in the formation of deaminated
product. phe-397 thus likely plays an additional role in
promoting the proper reaction chemistry during the protonation step.
experimental procedures
materials
[1-14co2]-l-orn (56 mci/mmol, 0.02 mm) was purchased
from amersham. hplc-grade acetonitrile, triethylamine,
buffers, plp, and pyrrolidine were purchased from sigma.
methods
modeling of l-orn into the odc active site. molecular
coordinates from the x-ray crystal structure of t. brucei odc
complexed with putrescine (pdb id code 1f3t) were used
to model the l-orn carboxylate onto putrescine. the carboxyl
group was oriented perpendicular to plp on the re face. the
structure was displayed in insightii version 97.0 (accelrys,
san diego, ca). hydrogens were added to putrescine using
the biopolymer module of insightii, and the carboxylate was
modeled using the position of the re face putrescine cr
hydrogen, again using the biopolymer to form the bond. the
torsion angle around the cr-co2 bond of the modeled l-orn
was rotated manually in insight ii to minimize steric conflicts
with active site residues.
site-directed mutagenesis, f397a odc expression, and
purification. the creation of the f397a t. brucei odc clone
was previously described (22). the mutant protein was
purified as described for wild type (16, 23) in yields of more
than 150 mg/l.
steady-state analysis of the reaction of l-orn with f397a
odc by determination of co2 production. the steady-state
analysis of f397a odc has been described previously (22).
a spectrophotometric assay that couples co2 production to
the oxidation of nadh was used to follow the steady-state
decarboxylation reaction (23). the reaction of f397a odc
(3-12 µm) with l-orn (0.1-8.0 mm) in the presence of
excess (50 µm) plp was monitored at 37 °c.
single turnover kinetic analysis of the reaction of f397a
odc with l-orn. [14c]-l-orn (3 µm) was incubated with a
molar excess of f397a t. brucei odc (12.5-800 µm) at
37 °c in 0.1 m hepes, ph 7.5, for 0-5 min. the reactions
were quenched with an equal volume of 2 m naoh and 50
mm cold l-orn. reactions were acidified with an equal
volume of concentrated hcl, and 14co2 was allowed to
evolve at room temperature overnight before the radioactivity
remaining in solution was quantified. the data were fitted
to the equation describing a single exponential decay (eq 1,
where n ) 1) to obtain kobs for each odc concentration.
the enzyme concentration dependence of kobs was fitted to
eq 2 to determine kdecarb and km,decarb.

pre-steady-state kinetic analysis by uv-vis stoppedflow spectroscopy. f397a odc (40 µm final) was mixed
with l-orn (0.12-45 mm final) in 0.1 m hepes, ph 7.5,
and 2 mm glutathione. reactions proceeded at 37 °c and
were monitored using a biologic sfm3 mixer with a tc100 (1 cm path length) quartz cell coupled to a biokine
pms-400. data were collected at 420 nm from 3 ms to 20
s. a spectrum was collected every 0.2 ms for the first 15
ms, every 1 ms for the next 385 ms, and every 50 ms for
the next 19600 ms. the dead time was 3 ms at a flow velocity
of 12 ml/s. single wavelength data were analyzed using
biokine 2.02 (biologic, claix, france) to determine the
observed rate constants, kobs, using eq 1.
for multiwavelength data collection the mixer was coupled
to a j&m tidas16 256 diode array (molecular kinetics,
pullman, wa) as described (16). data were collected over
310-500 nm for 3-28950 ms. a spectrum was collected
every 1 ms for the first 156 ms, every 7 ms for the next 861
ms, every 27 ms for the next 3942 ms, and every 124 ms
for the next 23991 ms. the dead time was 3 ms at a flow
velocity of 12 ml/s. multiwavelength data were analyzed
using specfit 2.12 (spectrum software associates, chapel
hill, nc) to determine the observed rate constants, kobs, as
described (13).
chromatographic determination of the steady-state rate
of product formation by f397a odc. f397a t. brucei
odc (60 µm) was incubated at 37 °c with 3 mm l-orn
(ph 7.5) in 15 mm potassium phosphate (ph 7.4), 3 mm
plp, and 1 mm dtt for a range of times (t ) 0 to t ) 4
min), and the reaction was quenched with 6.7% tca.
samples were reduced with 10 mg/ml nabh4 and derivatized with an acc q-fluor reagent kit (waters, milford, ma)
as described (13). derivatized ligand was separated by hplc
using an accq‚tag column (waters, milford, ma). the
column was preequilibrated with 80% eluent a (17 mm
triethylamine, 140 mm sodium acetate, ph 5.04) and 20%
eluent b (100% acetonitrile), and the derivatized product was
eluted under the same conditions. the column was calibrated
using the retention times of the following reduced and
derivatized standards (12-60 pmol): pyrrolidine (rt ) 7.5
min) and putrescine (rt ) 11.15 min). the concentrations
of products were determined by intergrating the area under
the curve for each peak and comparing these values to a
standard curve generated from known concentrations of
products. peaks were monitored with a rainin dynamax
fluorescence detector, model fl-1 (lambdaex ) 250 nm, lambdaem )
395 nm). reactions with at least three turnovers but less than
20% l-orn depletion were analyzed to obtain rates.

putrescine (experimental procedures). the co2 group was

groups (phe-397, tyr-389, tyr-323, and the methylene
carbons of lys-69) and with asp-361 (figure 2). the closest
predicted contacts are to phe-397, to the methylene carbons
of lys-69, and to asp-361. cys-360 also forms close contacts
to the modeled carboxylate; however, this residue has been
observed in multiple conformations in the structures of native
odc versus the structures liganded with  xxxd1972xxx  or putrescine
(12, 13). these data suggest that rotation around the cbeta atom
of cys-360 could readily occur to accommodate the carboxylate moiety. lys-69 forms interactions with the substrate
carboxylate through the methylene groups of its side chain;
the lys-69 n-amino group in the liganded structure is turned
out of the pocket to interact with asp-88 and glu-94 and
does not appear in position to form h-bonding interactions
with the substrate carboxylate. asp-361, while close to the
predicted co2 binding site, also forms a through-water
interaction with the delta-amino group of substrate and has been
demonstrated to be essential for substrate binding (12, 17).
overall, the predicted substrate carboxylate binding site
is composed of hydrophobic and electron-rich residues that
would provide unfavorable interactions with the charged
substrate carboxylate. lys-69 has already been demonstrated
to have an essential role both in schiff base formation and
in the decarboxylation step (19). the prediction that phe397 forms a major component of the carboxylate binding
site suggests that this residue will also play an important
role in promoting decarboxylation. to provide additional
evidence for the predicted carboxylate binding site and to
investigate the role of phe-397 in the chemistry of the odc
reaction, the ala mutant of phe-397 (f397a odc) was
characterized by pre-steady-state and single turnover kinetic
analysis.
steady-state rate of the reaction of l-orn with f397a
odc. steady-state analysis of f397a odc was previously
reported by our laboratory (22). the steady-state rate of the
decarboxylation of l-orn by f397a odc (kcat ) 0.06 s-1)
is reduced by 150-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme,
while the km for the reaction was not affected (table 1).
single turnover kinetic analysis of f397a odc with
[1-14co2]-l-orn. single turnover kinetics provides information on the reaction steps up to and including the first

figure 3: single turnover data for the reaction of f397a odc
with l-orn. [1-14c]-l-orn (3 µm) was reacted at 37 °c with odc
at multiple enzyme concentrations: (b) 12.5 µm, (o) 25 µm, (2)
50 µm, (0) 100 µm, and (9) 400 µm. the decrease in radioactivity
resulting from the loss of 14co2 from solution was followed over
time. the data were fitted to eq 1 (n ) 1) to determine the observed
rate constant (kobs). kobs obtained from each concentration of odc
were fitted to eq 2 (inset) to obtain kdecarb and km,decarb (table 1).

displayed as lines.

irreversible step. these steps in the odc reaction mechanism
potentially include schiff base formation and decarboxylation
(figure 1). kinetic steps following decarboxylation (e.g.,
protonation and product release) do not contribute to the
single turnover kinetics. for wild-type odc, the data suggest
that the single turnover rate reflects the decarboxylation step
(13, 16).
the reaction of f397a t. brucei odc (12.5-800 µm)
with [1-14co2]-l-orn (3 µm) was followed under single
turnover conditions at 37 °c. the 14co2 formed during the
reaction was evolved from solution under acidic conditions,
allowing the progress of the reaction to be followed by
monitoring the loss of radioactivity in solution (figure 3).
the data obtained demonstrated first-order kinetics and were
fitted to eq 1 (n ) 1) to obtain the observed rate constant
(kobs). this reaction was followed at multiple enzyme
concentrations, and the data were fitted to eq 2 to obtain
kdecarb and km,decarb (table 1). compared with the wild-type
enzyme, kdecarb for f397a odc (0.07 s-1) is reduced by
2100-fold. the rate constant kdecarb represents the overall
catalytic rate of the reaction through the decarboxylation step.
the decarboxylation rate obtained from this single turnover
analysis is similar to the overall steady-state rate of 0.06 s-1,
thus demonstrating that this step has become rate limiting
in the mutant enzyme. this result is in contrast to the wildtype enzyme where product release is the rate-limiting step
of the steady-state reaction (13, 16).
pre-steady-state kinetic analysis by multiwavelength and
single wavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy of the reaction of f397a odc with l-orn. the absorbance spectrum
of plp is sensitive to the electronic and tautomeric state of
the cofactor, and the formation and decay of reaction
intermediates can be monitored spectrally by stopped-flow
methods (13, 16). the reaction of f397a odc (40 µm) with
l-orn (22.5 mm) was followed by multiwavelength (310500 nm) stopped-flow spectroscopy under pre-steady-state
conditions (figure 4). the first observed phase is character-

selected time points are displayed at 3 ms (solid line), 252 ms

ized by an increase at 420 nm and a decrease at 330 nm and
the second by a decrease in the 420 nm signal and an increase
at 330 nm. the spectral properties of the initial species are
characteristic of a schiff base as previously reported for the
wild-type enzyme (16). the spectral characteristics of the
cofactor observed at the end of the reaction suggest that a
ketimine intermediate has formed similar to what was
observed for the c360a and c360s mutant odcs (13). for
the cys-360 mutants this spectral intermediate was due to
the production of the off-pathway product pmp resulting
from the protonation of the quinoid intermediate at c4′
instead of cr following decarboxylation (figure 1). thus,
these data suggest that f397a odc is also catalyzing
abortive transamination at an increased rate over the wildtype enzyme.
single wavelength data were collected at 420 nm for a
range of substrate concentrations (0.12-45 mm) to further
analyze the pre-steady-state reaction. the data are minimally
described by a two-step model and were fitted to eq 1 (n )
2) to obtain the observed rate constants. both phases are
dependent on the concentration of l-orn. the first phase
(increase at 420 nm) does not saturate in an experimentally
accessible substrate range, while phase 2 (decrease at 420
nm) is fully saturated above 0.25 mm l-orn. attempts to
fit the substrate dependence data to a simple linear two- or
three-step model failed. the modeling suggests that additional steps or off-pathway events are required to describe
the data, but given the small amplitude of phase 1, noise in
the data, and only two observed transitions, inclusion of more
steps in the model would require overfitting the data. hplc
analysis of the reaction products (below) demonstrates that
the product is deaminated in 30% of the turnovers. thus two
competing reactions, formation of putrescine and formation
of gamma-aminobutyraldehyde, will both contribute to the observed spectral changes, and this finding may be the cause
of the complexity observed in the data. regardless, the
spectral data are consistent with formation of a ketimine
intermediate with a rate constant (kobs2 ) 0.079 ( 0.003), at
saturating l-orn concentration, which is the same as those
observed in both the steady-state analysis and the single
turnover analysis. this step is preceded by minimally one
faster step (kobs1 ) 23 ( 1 s-1 at 22.5 mm orn).

were fitted to eq 1 (n ) 2) to obtain the observed rate constants
for a two-step reaction process, where kobs1 ) 23 ( 1 s-1 and kobs2
) 0.051 ( 0.001 s-1. data are displayed as filled circles, and the
fit is displayed as a solid line. residuals to the fit are displayed
above the data plot.

these data support the conclusion that the single turnover
kinetics, the steady-state kinetics, and the final observable
step (kobs2) from the pre-steady-state absorbance data are
measuring the same reaction chemistry, which based on the
single turnover data is likely to be the decarboxylation step
(table 1). the ketimine intermediate cannot form until after
decarboxylation (figure 1) and would not contribute to the
single turnover rate. thus, these data suggest either that
decarboxylation and protonation occur in a concerted step
or that the protonation step is fast relative to the decarboxylation step. these data provide no information about the rates
of product release, because these steps follow the ratedetermining step.
the fast step observed in the stopped-flow data likely
represents substrate binding steps, which could include the
formation of the michaelis complex, the gem-diamine, and
schiff base species. for the wild-type enzyme, schiff base
formation is complete during the dead time of the mixer [rate
> 1000 s-1 at 37 °c (16, 19)]. two steps were observed to
precede decarboxylation for the arg mutant of lys-69, and
a minimum of one step was observed for the cys-360 mutant
enzymes (13, 19). the first observed step in the reaction of
l-orn with f397a odc (k1 ) 23 s-1) is minimally 40-fold
slower than observed for the wild-type enzyme.
chromatographic determination of the steady-state rate
of product formation by f397a odc. product formation
catalyzed by the reaction of f397a odc with l-orn was
analyzed by hplc in the presence of excess plp (figure
6). if transamination occurs, the product of the reaction is
pmp and gamma-aminobutyraldehyde (gammaaba). reduction of
gammaaba with nabh4 yields the commercially available
compound pyrrolidine, which allows the reaction to be
standardized. the products of the reaction of l-orn with
f397a odc were reduced with nabh4, and they were
analyzed by hplc after derivitization using the accq‚tag
kit (waters, milford, ma). the overall steady-state rates of

corresponding peaks. the unlabeled peak is background and does
not increase with increased incubation time. kinetic constants were
obtained by collecting peak areas for a range of reaction times,
and the concentration of pyrrolidine (reduced gammaaba) or putrescine
in the sample was determined by comparison to a standard curve
of known concentrations.

putrescine and gammaaba formation were determined to be 0.029
s-1 and 0.015 s-1, respectively, as described in experimental
procedures (0.044 s-1 total product formation) (table 1).
under these conditions 66% of the product formed was
putrescine, while 34% of enzymatic turnovers resulted in
formation of the off-pathway product gammaaba (measured as
pyrrolidine). wild-type odc catalyzes abortive deamination
in <0.01% of turnovers (13); thus, mutation of f397 to ala
resulted in a significant increase in off-pathway protonation
events.
discussion
enzymes can accelerate chemical reactions either by
stabilizing the transition state or by destabilizing the ground
state (24, 25). plp-dependent enzymes such as odc utilize
the electron-withdrawing properties of the plp cofactor to
stabilize reaction intermediates, thus lowering activation
barriers (4). in these enzymes the apoenzyme facilitates
proper orientation of the reacting groups relative to the pi
electrons of the cofactor to promote reactivity and control
reaction specificity. in addition, the environment of the
enzyme site that interacts with the leaving group could
provide either stabilizing or destabilizing interactions to direct
catalysis.
the x-ray structures of t. brucei odc bound to decarboxylated  xxxd1972xxx  (12) or to d-orn (20) both suggest that
the carboxylate of l-orn will be bound in a buried pocket
on the re face of the cofactor, formed by aromatic,
hydrophobic, and negatively charged residues (figure 2).
binding of the co2 leaving group on the re face of the
cofactor has the additional advantage of placing the l-orn
cr proton on the opposite face from lys-69. the active site
lys residue is the catalytic base in enzymes that catalyze

jackson et al.
proton abstraction [e.g., aspartate aminotransferase (26-28)
and alanine racemase (29)]. thus placement of this proton
away from a potential catalytic base disfavors proton
abstraction, which would yield the incorrect reaction chemistry. structural studies of the apoenzyme of  xxxd3361xxx -o-3phosphate decarboxylase bound to substrate also demonstrate
that this enzyme places the carboxylate leaving group on
the opposite face of the plp cofactor from the catalytic lys
residue (30).
this model for l-orn binding suggests that phe-397 will
form one of the dominant contacts between the enzyme and
the co2 leaving group. in support of this hypothesis the data
presented here demonstrate that mutation of phe-397 to ala
reduces the rate of the decarboxylation step by 2100-fold.
further, while product release is rate limiting for wild-type
odc (16), the decarboxylation step has become rate limiting
in the mutant enzyme. thus phe-397 plays an essential role
in facilitating the decarboxylation step in odc catalysis.
phe-397 also contributes to the reaction fidelity of odc.
mutation of phe-397 to ala resulted in a significant increase
in off-pathway protonation events. the increased level of
off-pathway transamination events observed in this mutant
may result from greater access to the c4′ position by water
or by poor positioning of a general acid required for correct
protonation. mutants of cys-360, a residue required for
correct protonation, have previously been demonstrated to
undergo transamination in 90% of the catalytic events (13).
the cys-360 side chain may function as a general acid in
the protonation step, and if so, loss of packing interactions
between residues from the phe-397 loop and the cys-360
loop may disrupt the functioning of this residue.
the predicted carboxylate binding site on odc is composed of hydrophobic and negatively charged or electronrich residues, all of which would provide unfavorable
interactions with the substrate carboxylate. this binding site
would be expected to disfavor the negatively charged
substrate carboxylate and to favor the more neutral transition
state. studies on model compounds have demonstrated a role
for a nonpolar environment in promoting decarboxylation;
the reaction rate was enhanced by several orders of magnitude in nonpolar solvent conditions (31, 32). this mechanism
for rate acceleration by enzymes is also supported by the
demonstration of an increased decarboxylation rate upon
binding of model substrates to the  xxxd1850xxx  environment of
catalytic antibodies (33-35). in further support for groundstate destabilization on odc, substrate has been demonstrated to bind 24-fold more weakly than product to a k69r
mutant of odc (19).
similar to odc, structural analysis of several other
decarboxylases demonstrates that the carboxylate group either
forms weak interactions with the enzyme or is bound in a
hydrophobic or negatively charged pocket that would provide
disfavorable interactions. the substrate carboxylate binding
pocket in pyruvoyl-dependent  xxxg1040xxx  is
predominantly hydrophobic and additionally contains a glu
residue (38). orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase,
unique in its ability to promote decarboxylation in the
absence of a prosthetic cofactor, is thought to achieve
catalytic rate acceleration by bringing the carboxylate leaving
group into close proximity with an active site asp residue
(39, 40). the large unfavorable repulsive effect upon binding
is compensated for in this case by strong noncovalent

role of active site phe in  xxxg1626xxx 
interactions with phosphate and ribose moieties of the
substrate (41).
the destabilizing interactions observed in the r-carboxylate binding site of the decarboxylases differ from plp
enzymes that catalyze proton abstraction. these enzymes
instead utilize the carboxylate as a binding determinant
through the formation of stabilizing interactions in the active
site. aspartate aminotransferase forms ionic and hydrogen
bond interactions with the r-carboxylate through interactions
with active site arg and gly residues (36), and alanine
racemase forms hydrogen bond interactions through active
site residues and water (37). one novel example of a
decarboxylase is dialkylglycine decarboxylase, a plpdependent enzyme that has the unusual burden of catalyzing
both decarboxylation and transamination. this enzyme is
reported to form multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with
the substrate carboxylate, though these contacts change
depending on if the substrate is oriented for decarboxylation
or proton abstraction (6, 42).
in summary, the data derived from the kinetic analysis of
f397a odc, combined with inferences drawn from t. brucei
odc crystal structures, support the hypothesis that the
carboxyl leaving group of l-orn is buried on the re face of
the cofactor. the hydrophobic and electron-rich nature of
this binding site promotes decarboxylation by destabilizing
the charged carboxylate and favoring the electrostatically
more neutral transition state.
