following the discovery of the weak, competitive and reversible acetylcholinesterase (ache)inhibiting activity of  xxxd2647xxx  (3c) (ic50 ) 85 µm on homogenized rat striatum ache), a
series of 3-amino-6-phenylpyridazines was synthesized and tested for inhibition of ache. a
classical structure-activity relationship exploration suggested that, in comparison to  xxxd2647xxx ,
the critical elements for high ache inhibition are as follows: (i) presence of a central pyridazine
ring, (ii) necessity of a lipophilic cationic head, (iii) change from a 2- to a 4-5-carbon units
distance between the pyridazine ring and the cationic head. among all the derivatives
investigated, 3-[2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)ethylamino]-6-phenylpyridazine (3y), which shows an
ic50 of 0.12 µm on purified ache (electric eel), was found to be one of the most potent antiache inhibitors, representing a 5000-fold increase in potency compared to  xxxd2647xxx .1
introduction

chart 1

senile dementia of the alzheimer’s type (sdat) is a
neurodegenerative disease affecting mainly aging populations. a deficit in cholinergic neurotransmission is
considered to be one of the major causes of disturbances
in learning and memory in sdat patients.2 muscarinic
m1 agonists3 can enhance cholinergic transmission, and
acetylcholinesterase (ache) inhibitors4 such as tacrine,
donepezil, and rivastigmine are already used as therapeutic agents for the palliative treatment of sdat.5,6
in the search for original ache inhibitors with
potential central bioavailability, we concentrated our
research on an aminopyridazine,  xxxd2647xxx  (3c) (chart
1), which possesses favorable characteristics. effectively,
 xxxd2647xxx , in addition to its original antidepressive
properties, exhibits cholinomimetic activities. thus, an
in vivo administration of  xxxd2647xxx  (30 mg/kg po) to
rats significantly increases acetylcholine (ach) levels
in the hippocampus (38%) and striatum (60%).7 in vitro,
 xxxd2647xxx  presents a weak, competitive, and reversible
ache inhibitive activity on homogenized rat striatum
(ic50 ) 85 µm)8 and a very weak activity on electric eel
ache (ic50 ) 600 µm). on the other hand,  xxxd2647xxx 
exhibits a weak but highly selective affinity for muscarinic  xxxg447xxx  (ic50 ) 17 µm, [3h] xxxd2965xxx ).9-12
assuming that the tertiary amino function (protonated
in vivo) can mimic the quaternary group of ach and
that the exo-endo amidino function can be considered
as bioisosteric to the ach ester function,8 we hypothesized that  xxxd2647xxx  can as well be recognized by the
muscarinic m1 receptors as by the enzyme ache. these
findings and the excellent central bioavailability of
 xxxd2647xxx  prompted us to investigate further around
this lead compound.
in the present study, we describe the synthesis and
the biochemical evaluation of a series of 3-amino-6* address correspondence to: prof c. g. wermuth. tel: +33 388

chemistry
a general synthesis of 3-aminoalkyl-substituted pyridazines 13-15 (tables 2 and 4) is shown in scheme 1.
the key intermediates in their preparation are imino
chlorides 2 which can be readily obtained from the
corresponding 3(2h)-pyridazinones 1 by the action of
phosphorus oxychloride. condensation of the imino
chlorides 2 with various primary amines 12 (table 1)
gave the final products 3. most of the 3(2h)-pyridazinones 1 were prepared according to the literature.16-20
the 4-trifluoromethyl-6-phenyl-3(2h)-pyridazinone (1j)
(scheme 2) was obtained by michael addition of kcn
to 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-2-buten-1-one (13),21 followed
by hydrolysis of the nitrile 14, esterification, and cyclization with hydrazine hydrate. it was converted to
3j by the previously described procedure (scheme 1).
the synthesis of 4-amino-6-phenylpyridazine (3k)
(scheme 2) involved a particular procedure. a nucleophilic displacement of the 1,1-bis(thiomethyl)-2-nitroethylene (15), first by 1-aminoethylmorpholine and then
by hydrazine hydrate, followed by condensation with
phenylglyoxal, allowed us to obtain 16. the catalytic
hydrogenation (h2, pd/c) of 16 gave 3k.
the preparation of the non-pyridazinic heterocyclic
compounds 4-6 (table 3) utilizes the general route

3-phenyl-1,2,4-triazinone (10c), was accomplished by a
slightly modified version of the procedure described by

s-ethylthiotriazine with 2-aminoethylpiperidine. catalytic hydrogenation (h2, pd/c) of the triazine 8 afforded
the dihydrotriazine 9.
the diamines 12a-12h (table 1) were prepared by
conventional methods (scheme 5): either alkylation of
the secondary amines by means of omega-halogenonitriles
(route a) or gabriel syntheses starting from the commercially available omega-bromoalkylphthalimides32 (route
b). a slightly modified method described by dutta et
al.33 allowed us to obtain 2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)ethylamine (12j) (scheme 6) after reduction of the
intermediate 2-(1-benzyl-4-piperidylidene)acetonitrile.34
results and discussion
the  xxxd2647xxx  analogues were initially tested for in
vitro inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in homogenized
rat striatum (tables 2 and 3) and, for more extensive
studies, on the commercially available electric eel ache
(table 4). the results obtained with the latter enzyme
preparations allow molecular modeling studies using the
published ache structure which is also derived from

the electric eel enzyme.35 the esterase activity was
determined according to the method of ellman et al.36
we observed that rather simple molecular variations
of the lead structure 3c can drastically modify ache
inhibition potency (table 2). thus, the replacement of
the terminal morpholino (3a, 3c) to a piperidino group
(3b, 3d) is associated with a noticeable increase in
ache inhibition (>75-fold for 3b and 15-fold for 3d).
the presence of a methyl group in the 4 position of the
pyridazine ring seems to be determinant for anti-ache
activity. compounds 3a and 3b were found to be
respectively 12 and 3 times less potent than compounds
3c and 3d. substituents other than methyl or hydrogen
in the 4-position are detrimental (3h-3l). substitution
of the phenyl ring was also investigated. slight increases
were observed for derivatives 3e-3g.
to select the most suitable central heterocycle, we
examined a set of pyridazine bioisosteres (table 3). the
replacement of the pyridazine ring (3b) by pyridine (4),
pyrimidine (5), 1,2,4-thiadiazole (7), and triazine (6 and
8) rings yielded compounds showing weaker activities.
the comparison shows clearly that the central py-

ridazine ring (3b) is particularly favorable, all the other
ring systems being 4 to 5 times less potent.
we chose to conserve the phenylpyridazine moiety
and to examine the importance of the nature and the
length of the side chain (table 4). the replacement of
the hydrophilic morpholine by a lipophilic monocyclic
side chain (3a f 3b or 3n) enhanced ache inhibition
10-fold when the distance n between the exo-amidinic
and the tertiary nitrogens corresponds to two methylene
units. the addition of an aromatic ring close to the
cationic nitrogen, such as found in the n-benzyl-nmethyl derivative 3s or its constraint 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl derivative 3o, did not modify dramatically the inhibition potency, at least for an n ) 2 value.
augmenting the distance between the exo-amidinic
nitrogen and the tertiary nitrogen atom (n ) 3, 4, and
5) entails a regular increase in potency: an 8-fold
increase for the passage from 3o to 3r and a 230-fold
increase for the passage from 3s to 3v.the flexibility of
the n-benzyl group seems to be critical for the antiache activity when the n distance corresponds to 4-5
methylene groups. thus, compound 3v is 14 times more
active than compound 3r. inserting the side-chain
methylenes in a piperidine ring (3w-3y) yields compounds which were more potent than the open equivalent n-benzyl-n-methyl derivatives. within this series
the inhibition potency increases with the side-chain
length. thus, the 3-[2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)ethylamino]6-phenylpyridazine (3y) was found to be respectively 46
and 540 times more active than the shorter analogues

3x and 3w. it is also 6 times more potent than the
corresponding open analogue equivalent 3v.
among all the compounds examined 3y was the most
potent inhibitor with an ic50 ) 0.12 µm on electric eel
ache. it appears thus that the ideal inter-nitrogen
distance corresponds to a 4- or 5-carbon chain and that
the most favorable lipophilic side chain is the ethyl
n-benzylpiperidinyl chain which is also present in
donepezil. the three compounds 3r, 3v, and 3y as well
as two references inhibitors, tacrine37 and donepezil,38,39
were then compared in order to determine their relative
inhibitory effects to acetyl and  xxxg248xxx 
(ic50 buche/ache). in addition to electric eel ache,
we used human erythrocytes as a source of ache and
human serum as a source of  xxxg248xxx 
(table 5). compound 3y is comparable to tacrine;
however, its buche/ache ratio is about 10 times more
favorable. compared to donepezil, compound 3y is about
10 times less potent and clearly less selective toward
buche. surprisingly the tetrahydroisoquinolinyl analogue 3r shows an inversed profile, being 150 times
more selective for  xxxg248xxx  than for acetylcholinesterase. as such it might present some interest
as a research tool.
conclusion
with respect to  xxxd2647xxx , chosen as lead compound,
we were able to prepare ache inhibitors with a 5000fold increased potency. structure-activity relationship
studies indicated that at least three factors are favorable

for potency: (i) presence of a central pyridazine ring,
(ii) presence of a lipophilic cationic head, (iii) change
from a 2- to a 4-5-carbon units distance between the
amidinic function and the tertiary amine. among the
different side chains tested, it is remarkable to notice
that the highest potency, together with the best discrimination between ache and buche inhibition, is
associated with the n-benzylpiperidine ethyl moiety.
the replacement of the n-benzylpiperidine ethyl side
chain by a tetrahydroisoquinolinyl side chain induces
surprisingly an inversion of the ache/buche inhibition
profile thus leading to a buche-selective inhibitor.

biological studies. in vitro measurement of acetylcholinesterase and  xxxg248xxx  inhibition.
acetylcholinesterase- and  xxxg248xxx -inhibiting activities were measured by the spectrophotometric method of
ellman et al.36 homogenates of rat striatal brain (1:20 w/v in
0.01 m sodium buffer, ph 7.2, with 10 µm tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide, approximately 1 unit/ml ache activity),
electric eel ache (type iii, electric eel, sigma chemical co.),
and human erythrocytes ache (type xiii, human erythrocytes, sigma chemical co.) were used as sources of ache, and
lyophilized human serum (crude powder, sigma chemical co.)
was used as source of buche. ache preparations from electric
eel and human erythrocytes and buche from human serum
were dissolved in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.2,
such as to have an enzyme solution stock with 2.5 units/ml
ache activity. acetylthiocholine iodide and butyrylthiocholine
iodide (sigma chemical co.) were used as the substrates of
the enzymatic reaction, and 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid
(dtnb) was used for the measurement of cholinesterase
activity. in this procedure, 940 µl of 0.1 m potassium buffer,
ph 8, with 60 mg/500 ml dtnb, 20 µl of test compound
solution, and 20 µl of enzyme stock solution (homogenate
striatal rat, electric eel, human erythrocyte ache, and human
serum buche) were mixed. after 10 min of preincubation, 20
µl of 10 mm acetylthiocholine/butyrylthiocholine iodide was
added to the assay solution. the final assay volume was 1 ml.
the change in absorbance at 412 nm was recorded (spectrophotometer uvikon 860) during 1 min at 25 °c. the reaction
rate was calculated. different concentrations (range of 10-910-3 m) of the test compound were assayed (triplicate), and
the percent inhibition due to the presence of test compound
was calculated. ic50 values were determined graphically from
log concentration-inhibition curves.
