outcomes: a case study of system failure

abstract elucidation of differences between the active
sites of cox-1 and cox-2 allowed the targeted design of
the selective cox-2 inhibitors known as coxibs. they were
marketed as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) that had improved upper gastrointestinal (gi) safety
compared with older non-selective nsaids such as diclofenac and naproxen. two gi safety studies conducted
with arthritis patients demonstrated that in terms of upper
gi safety, celecoxib was not superior to diclofenac
(class study) but rofecoxib was superior to naproxen
(vigor study). however, the vigor study revealed also
that rofecoxib had increased cardiovascular (cv) risk
compared with naproxen. this clinical outcome was supported by the existence of plausible eicosanoid-based biological mechanisms whereby selective cox-2 inhibition
could increase cv risk. nevertheless, the existence of cv
risk with rofecoxib was successfully discounted by its
pharmaceutical company owner, merck & co, with the
assistance of specialist opinion leaders and rofecoxib
achieved widespread clinical use for 4–5 years. rofecoxib
was withdrawn from the market when several clinical trials
in colorectal cancer and post-operative pain revealed increased cv risk with not only rofecoxib, but also coxibs.
the commercial success of rofecoxib provides a case-study
of failure of the medical journal literature to guide drug
usage. attention to ethical issues may have provided a
more useful guide for prescribers.

introduction
cyclooxygenase (cox) is the target for the traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid), examples of
which include indomethacin, naproxen, ibuprofen and
diclofenac [1]. these drugs are effective in providing
symptomatic relief from inflammation most likely because
the cox product  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) is involved in
vasodilation, extravasation of fluid, and hyperalgesia in
inflammatory foci. however, pge2 also has a protective
role in the stomach where it is involved in maintenance of
the protective mucosal barrier [2]. therefore, nsaid use
for symptomatic treatment of inflammation is associated
with gastropathies and these can be sufficiently severe to
result in hospitalization and death [3].
the discovery of two cox isotypes and the further
discovery that cox-2 was involved in production of pge2
in inflammatory sites whereas cox-1 was involved in
maintenance of gastric mucosal protection, provided a
face-value rationale for development of selective cox-2
inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents with reduced upper
gi adverse effects compared with traditional nsaid [2].

both cox isotypes have long hydrophobic substrate binding channels with the channel being slightly larger in cox-2
than cox-1. molecular modelling indicates the presence of
a hydrophobic pocket that branches from the main substrate
binding channel. however, access to the pocket is restricted

in cox-1 due to the presence at position 523 of a bulky
isoleucine whereas in cox-2 this position is occupied by a
valine [4]. this structural difference allowed the development of coxibs, a class of selective cox-2 inhibitors that
exploit selective access to the side pocket in cox-2 [5].
however, some traditional nsaid also have selectivity for
cox-2 inhibition when examined in vitro. there is a continuum of selectivities among traditional nsaids and
coxibs ranging from cox-1 selective to cox-2 selective.
for example, indomethacin is cox-1 selective, diclofenac
and celecoxib are modestly cox-2 selective and each have
similar selectivities for cox-2, whereas rofecoxib is highly
cox-2 selective [6].

eicosanoid synthesis: in vitro studies
selective cox-2 inhibitors were developed with the goal
of inhibiting pge2 synthesis in areas of inflammation but
not in the stomach. however, this goal did not recognise
that pge2 is not the immediate product of cox-1 or cox2. both cox-1 and cox-2 catalyse the same reaction,
which with  xxxd208xxx  as substrate, is the production
of pgh2. pgh2 is the common substrate for a number of
prostaglandin synthases and thromboxane synthase
(fig. 1).
inspection of fig. 1 suggests that inhibition of cox-1 or
cox-2 or both isotypes should decrease synthesis of all
pgh2 metabolites. however, selective cox-2 inhibition
results in selective inhibition of pge2 rather than txa2 in
monocytes [7] and selective inhibition of pgi2 rather than
txa2 in endothelial cells [8, 9]. this phenomenon is
probably linked to the observations that early after monocyte or endothelial cell stimulation, only txa2 is produced
whereas with increasing time to allow for induction of
cox-2, there is an increase in monocyte pge2 or endothelial pgi2 with little or no further increase in txa2
synthesis [7–11] (fig. 2).
a possible explanation for all of these findings lies in the
different km values of the synthase enzymes. tx synthase
has a 17-fold lower km than pge synthase [11] and indirect
studies infer a similar situation for tx synthase versus pgi
synthase [8]. thus, in the early phase of endothelial cell
stimulation when only constitutive cox-1 is present, the
pgh2 concentration is sufficient for txa2 synthesis but

not substantive pgi2 synthesis. with time there is induction
of cox-2, which substantially increases pgh2 concentration leading to pgi2 synthesis. however, due to the lower
km of tx synthase compared with that of pgi synthase,
there is little if any further increase in txa2 synthesis due
to saturation of tx synthase with substrate. conversely,
selective inhibition of cox-2 would decrease pgi2 synthesis with little or no effect on txa2 synthesis, as has
been observed in endothelial cells stimulated with il-1b or
platelets or hypoxia [8–10].
these findings from in vitro studies suggest that endothelial cox-2 has a protective anti-thrombotic role in response to stress.

eicosanoid synthesis: in vivo studies
although it is not possible to directly measure endothelial
pgi2 synthesis in vivo, human studies support the importance of cox-2 for pgi2 synthesis. the selective cox-2
inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib, decreased the urinary
content of pgi2 metabolites while having little or no effect
on platelet txa2 synthesis in healthy volunteers [12, 13].
whether or not the source of the pgi2 metabolites in urine
was the endothelium is not known. also, whether or not
cox-2 is present in unstimulated healthy endothelium is
not known although it is clearly present in atherosclerotic
vessels [14–16]. while laminar flow has been shown to upregulate endothelial cox-2 in vitro [17], cox-2 is generally found in low levels or not detected in non-atherosclerotic endothelium [14].
studies on cox-2 in the heart indicate that myocardial
up-regulation of cox-2 is an important protective response
to injury caused by anthracyclines or oxidative stress [18,
19]. also, myocardial cox-2 upregulation and consequent
pgi2 production is a critical event in the protective effect
of ischemic pre-conditioning [20].

lipids (2007) 42:779–785

781

collectively, the studies on eicosanoid synthesis in vitro
and in vivo suggest that cox-2 upregulation provides a
cardioprotective response in stressed myocardium and an
anti-thrombotic response in blood vessels. it is noteworthy
that selective cox-2 inhibition has the opposite action of
 xxxd234xxx  in suppressing endothelial prostacyclin
synthesis but not platelet thromboxane synthesis [21]
(fig. 3).

clinical effects of selective cox-2 inhibitors
the first two coxibs approved for clinical use were celecoxib and rofecoxib, marketed as celebrex and vioxx,
respectively. they both relieved the signs and symptoms of
inflammation with efficacy similar to that of the conventional nsaids [5]. however, in order to claim that they
had superior upper gi safety over the traditional nsaids,
the regulatory authorities required clinical trials, in which
measurement of upper gi safety was the primary aim. the
most important measure of upper gi safety is that of ulcer
complications, i.e. bleeds, perforations, obstructions. these
events cause morbidity and hospitalisation and are potentially life-threatening. a less important measure is that of
symptomatic ulcers because they are not life-threatening
and are readily treated with medication that can be curative.
class was a combination of two upper gi safety
studies in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis where
participants were allocated either to celecoxib or one of
two conventional nsaids, diclofenac or ibuprofen. lowdose aspirin, widely used as an anti-thrombotic agent, was
allowed as indicated. outcomes at 6 months of treatment
were published and these showed a statistically significant
advantage of celecoxib over the combined nsaid groups
for the composite measure of ulcer complications +
symptomatic ulcers; however there was no advantage
of celecoxib for ulcer complications alone [22]. the

submission of these data to the fda by gd searle & co
indicated that the actual duration of the two safety studies
was in fact 12 and 15 months. these were the durations
required to reach the pre-specified end-point of at least 20
ulcer complications in each study or a maximum of 45
ulcer complications in both studies combined. the fda
analysis shows that at actual study completion, celecoxib
was not superior to the combined nsaid groups for either
of the upper gi safety measure [23]. it was revealed that
the complete 12–15 month trial data for class were
available when the 6–month analysis was published. the
fda review also concluded that there was no evidence of
cardiovascular risk with celecoxib from the class study.
the adenoma prevention with celecoxib (apc) study
examined colorectal cancer prevention with celecoxib
versus placebo in participants with adenomatous colorectal
polyps. while there was a decreased incidence of colorectal adenomas with celecoxib, there was statistically
significant dose-related increase in thrombotic cardiovascular events with celecoxib [24].
as for celecoxib, rofecoxib also was examined for upper
gi safety and later for colorectal cancer prevention. the
upper gi safety study known as vigor allocated rheumatoid arthritis patients to either rofecoxib or the conventional nsaid, naproxen. aspirin use or a requirement
for aspirin use was an exclusion criterion. unlike class,
vigor demonstrated superiority to the nsaid comparator, naproxen, for both upper gi safety measures, i.e. ulcer
complications alone and the combined measure of ulcer
complications + symptomatic ulcers [25, 26]. however,
there was a four fold increase in myocardial infarction with
rofecoxib [25, 26]. the fda review showed that the increase in the combined thrombotic cardiovascular events
with rofecoxib matched its upper gi benefits and therefore,
the fda review concluded that rofecoxib offered no
overall safety advantage over naproxen [25]. by contrast,
the new england journal medicine (nejm) publication of
the vigor trial concluded with no supporting evidence
that the increased myocardial infarction with rofecoxib did
not exist and that the results were due to a cardioprotective
effect of naproxen. the overall conclusion was that vigor was a success in demonstrating upper gi safety [26].
a further study with rofecoxib, approve, like the
apc study with celecoxib, had the aim of examining
colorectal cancer prevention. patients with a history of
colorectal adenomas were randomly allocated to rofecoxib
or placebo. the trial was stopped early due to an approximate 5-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction and an
approximate two fold increased risk of combined adverse
cardiovascular events [27].
a randomised controlled trial of oral  xxxd3481xxx  and its
intravenous pro-drug,  xxxd2849xxx , for analgesia in patients
having coronary artery bypass surgery also showed an

123

782

approximate four fold increased risk of combined cardiovascular events [28].
thus, evidence from these randomised controlled trials
suggests that increased cardiovascular risk is a class effect
with coxibs. meta-analysis of database and case-control
studies suggests that there is increased cardiovascular risk
with many nsaids, although not with naproxen [29]. in
that analysis, the highest relative risk was 1.40 and that
occurred with diclofenac, which is also the most cox-2
selective of the traditional nsaids [6, 29].

marketing of the coxibs and maintenance
of uncertainty
the results of the class and vigor trials were published in 2000. the respective publications declared celecoxib and rofecoxib to have superior upper gi safety to
the comparator nsaids [22, 26]. however, the fda reviews showed this was not true for celecoxib at the preplanned time of study completion and showed that, when
the increased cardiovascular events with rofecoxib were
considered, it had no overall safety advantage [23, 25].
notwithstanding the fda analyses both drugs achieved
‘‘blockbuster’’ status in the marketplace [30].
it is accepted that most researchers and clinicians do not
examine the fda website for reviews of pharmaceutical
company submissions. however, it is difficult to understand why there was an uncritical acceptance of the conclusions of the medical journal publications of class and
vigor. as discussed below it is difficult also to understand how the interpretations of data published in these
prestigious journals survived disinterested critical review.
even though only the 6-month data from class were
originally published [22], it was clear that celecoxib was
not superior to the combined nsaid comparator group for
the incidence of complicated upper gi events, which
clinically is the more important outcome measure [31]. in
the publication of the vigor results, it was clear that there
was a 4-fold increase in myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib group [26]. although this publication concluded
that this result was due to a protective effect of naproxen,
no evidence was presented for such an effect. in addition, it
was soon followed by publication of the analyses of a large
medicaid database that concluded naproxen did not have a
protective effect and that rofecoxib was associated with an
increase in cardiovascular risk [32, 33].
despite this published information, vioxx exceeded
us$2 billion in sales per year for 2001–03 [34]. the
principle that there should be caution with the prescribing
of new drugs due to limited information about their
effectiveness, long-term safety, and whether they offer an
overall advantage over existing medications did not seem

123

lipids (2007) 42:779–785

to be applied [35]. a possible explanation is that clinicians
were persuaded by consistently positive marketing messages. in the year after the launch of vioxx, spending on
direct to consumer advertising in the us for vioxx exceeded the advertising expenditure for pepsi and budweiser [36]. also, the us congressional hearings into the
relationships between the fda and the pharmaceutical
industry revealed that merck’s instructions to their sales
representatives were designed to dampen any physician
concerns about cardiovascular risk. if clinicians enquired
about this risk, the sales representative handed them a
‘‘cardiovascular card’’, which contained no data from the
vigor study and in addition, claimed that vioxx was
actually 8–11 times safer than anti-inflammatory drugs like
naproxen. when an fda advisory committee recommended that clinicians should be informed of the cardiovascular results from the vigor study, the sales staff were
specifically instructed not to initiate discussion with clinicians on the fda advisory recommendation [37].
thus, one reason for the sustained blockbuster status of
vioxx and celebrex is that clinician concerns were allayed
by pharmaceutical company sales and marketing practices.
however, this does not necessarily explain why there was
not an appropriate response at the academic level to the
medical journal literature. the reviewers of the nejm
submission on the vigor study should have insisted that
the conclusion that naproxen had a cardioprotective effect
was without merit [26]. they should also have insisted that
the manuscript conclude that the study showed no overall
safety advantage of vioxx, when both serious upper gi
events and cardiovascular events were taken into consideration.
shortly after publication of the nejm article on the
vigor study, a pooled analysis of cardiovascular risk
using data from merck trials with rofecoxib was published
in circulation [38]. the study concluded there was no
cardiovascular risk with rofecoxib relative to placebo and
non-naproxen nsaids. however, the studies varied in
duration from only 4 weeks to 15 months, five of the seven
authors were merck employees, and the manuscript was
accepted one day after submission. none of these factors
alone necessarily determines how one should assess the
merits of a publication. however, one should be mindful
that this publication served to reinforce the notion that
naproxen was cardioprotective and that rofecoxib only
appeared to increase cv risk against this comparator. at
the very least, this apparently unrefereed publication in
circulation helped sustain uncertainty about cv risk with
rofecoxib during the ensuing years until its withdrawal
from the market.
thus there was a second reason for the maintenance of
vioxx sales, i.e. there was a failure in academic and therapeutic medicine to deal with this uncertainty. recourse to

lipids (2007) 42:779–785

the principles used by research ethics committees/institutional review boards (rec/irb) would have provided a
straightforward remedy. these committees deal routinely
with such prominent uncertainty by simply informing the
research participants of its existence. thus, if presented
with a clinical trial involving vioxx, it is likely that the
rec/irb would have insisted that the cardiovascular results of the vigor study were communicated in the informed consent document. this is a simple way of dealing
with uncertainty and it accords with the principle of patient
or research participant autonomy, also expressed as respect
for persons. this consideration, which is embraced in the
institutional research environment was lacking in the
therapeutic/marketing environment.

summary and conclusions
an examination of this sequence of events shows inappropriate acts of omission, commission and lack of integration. the aims of vigor were to examine safety.
however, the report in the nejm [26] overemphasized
upper gi safety and greatly downplayed cv safety to an
extent which was an act of omission and to an extent that
should not have been accepted by the reviewers or the
journal. the subsequent fda review of vigor was
exemplary in concluding that, when the increase in adverse cv events is considered ‘‘this risk reduction in
relevant gi events did not translate into an overall safety
benefit of rofecoxib over naproxen.’’ and that ‘‘information regarding cardiovascular thrombotic events should be
added to the vioxx label.’’[25]. however, there was a
delay of nearly two years in adding a cv warning to the
prescribing information [37, 39]. labelling delay notwithstanding, it is not clear that the label warning had a
substantial influence on prescribing in the face of more
than $100 million per year spent on direct-to-consumer
advertising and a sales force directed to use an information card for prescribers, the ‘‘cardiovascular card’’ that
deliberately omitted mention of cardiovascular risk [36,
37, 39].
the omission by merck of accurate information on
cardiovascular risk in its advertising and sales force
packages may or may not be illegal. this issue is currently
playing out in the legal actions underway in the us jurisdiction. however, this omission was certainly unethical. it
was a disregard for people’s right to information that was
material in their decision making as to whether to take or to
prescribe vioxx. it was a disregard for the ethical principle
of respect for a person’s autonomy. the omission of balanced discussion of cv risk in the nejm publication of
vigor is perplexing. whether the reviewers of the article
and the journal would have treated committed inaccuracies

783

more diligently than they treated this act of omission is
unknown.
this sequence of events raises the question of who
should have taken responsibility for integration of this
information into a risk and benefit evaluation. while
several individuals published concerns about cv risk
with coxibs [33, 40, 41] the medical journal literature
collectively served to promote efficacy but perpetuate
uncertainty about cv risk. the interested pharmaceutical
company downplayed or omitted mention of cv risk.
however, the regulator, i.e. the fda, dispassionately
assessed vioxx as having no net health benefit. it has
been argued that the fda should have acted quicker on
the labelling change and that they should have mandated
a cv safety study [39]. their obligations in the regulation of vioxx has been considered by the us congress
[37, 42].
as a postscript, it is worth noting that although the
coxibs attracted premium pricing due to their claims of
superior upper gi safety compared with traditional lessselective nsaids, the nsaid gastropathy epidemic had
essentially finished before the introduction of coxibs. this
is well illustrated by the following epidemiological study
that used databases on >5,500 rheumatoid arthritis (ra)
patients in the us and canada. it showed that hospitalizations for nsaid-related gastropathies increased from
0.6% of this ra population in 1981 to a peak of 1.5% in
1992 whereafter it declined back to 0.5% in 2000 with the
main decline occurring before the introduction of the
selective cox-2 inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib [3].
the decline was due to movement away from the most
gastrotoxic nsaids and to moderation of doses. if this
result had been reported during the development phase of
the selective cox-2 inhibitors, the business projections
may have been less enthusiastic.
