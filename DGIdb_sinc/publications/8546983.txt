 xxxd2403xxx , an h1-receptor antagonist, is an antihistamince used as an
antiallergic drug. its molecular structure is close to the phenothiazines,
but it has different photobiological properties. like phenothiazines,  xxxd2403xxx  is phototoxic with ultraviolet a (uva) but it reduces the erythema response to uvb radiation.  xxxd2403xxx  seems to have the same
protective properties as a sunscreen because its uvb protective properties are effective only if the substance is applied prior to exposure.

 xxxd2403xxx , an h1-receptor antagonist, is an antihistamine used as an antiallergic drug (14).
pharmacological studies have shown strong antihistaminic properties with minimum toxic side effects. we have observed several patients who presented photosensitization when using topical  xxxd2403xxx  (apaisyp gel). phototoxic dermatitis is
a well known side effect in patients treated with
phenothiazines (5), and  xxxd2403xxx  has a very
similar chemical structure (fig. 1). the purpose of
this study is to evaluate the importance of isothipend yl photo toxicity.

phototoxic and photoprotective effects of  xxxd2403xxx 

photopatch test (number 10) and an  xxxd2403xxx 
2.5% uva-photopatch test (number 11) showed a
photo toxic dermatitis.
all photopatch tests exposed to a uvb suberythematous dose were negative, except for patient
14. all tested areas exposed to 2 med uvb were
uniformly erythematous except for a few. indeed,
we observed inhibition of the erythema response
to uvb with  xxxd2403xxx @(numbers 9-17) and  xxxd2403xxx  2.5% (numbers 10-13) (fig. 3a, 4). histology of the  xxxd2403xxx @2 med uvb photopatch
test with photoinhibition (number 10) was normal.
on the other hand, there was no inhibition of erythema when apaisyp and  xxxd2403xxx  were applied after 2 med of uvb irradiation (numbers
18-20).
positive photopatch tests were observed with
promethazine (uva: 5 cases, uvb: i case). there
was no inhibition of erythema with promethazine
after 2 med of uvb. on the contrary, patient 14
had an increased erythema on the 2 med uvb
promethazine photopatch test (fig 4).
 xxxd2403xxx  induces more phototoxic reactions
than promethazine ( xxxd2403xxx  1%: i 3 cases, promethazine 1%: 5 cases).
eight days after irradiation, the intensity of melanin pigmentation was strongly reduced on  xxxd2403xxx @and  xxxd2403xxx -treated sites (fig 3b).

discussion

this study shows that  xxxd2403xxx  is a phototoxic
drug. immediate whealing after irradiation has already been described for the phenothiazines (6).
however, this phototoxic reaction was observed

only in the uva range, even though the absorption
spectrum of  xxxd2403xxx  peaks at 245 nm (fig. 5).
the phenothiazines have a similar absorption
spectrum, with a peak at 250 nm. to obtain phototoxicity, a threshold amount of  xxxd2403xxx  must
be applied to the skin, and in some patients (numbers 10-13), the positivity of the photopatch tests
was correlated with the dilution of  xxxd2403xxx .
we also observed that  xxxd2403xxx  seems to be
more phototoxic than promethazine. because oral
or topic  xxxd2403xxx  is often recommended in the
summer for sunburn or insect bites, it is surprising
that photosensitization has not been described previously ( 1 4 ) .
uvb irradiation did not give the same results
with  xxxd2403xxx  and promethazine. after irradiation with a suberythematous dose, no reaction was observed with  xxxd2403xxx . by contrast,
after irradiation with 2 med uvb, some patients
had reduced uvb-induced erythema, but only
with the  xxxd2403xxx @ and  xxxd2403xxx  photopatch
tests. surprisingly one patient (number 14) had increased erythema on the promethazine photopatch
test.
reduced uv-induced erythema has already been
published for other drugs. the erythema1 response
that follows uv exposure is caused in part by the release of prostaglandins, and this can be blocked by
the topical application of a free radical scavenger (7)
or indomethacin (8). in the different studies, the
tested substance was applied 15 min prior to uv exposure or after exposure. we have tested  xxxd2403xxx , using occlusive finn chambers@24 h before uv
exposure; the occlusion probably increases  xxxd2403xxx 's cutaneous absorption, and this may be why
the reduction in erythema and pigmentation are so
obvious. erythema is so obviously reduced that we
did not need to use a chromameter to quantify it.
however, when  xxxd2403xxx  was applied with occlusion (finn chambers@)just after irradiation,
there was no reduction in erythema. this suggests
that  xxxd2403xxx  may act as a sunscreen agent (9)
and that it does not block the release of inflammatory mediators after irradiation. ljunggren &
moller (5) have observed that chlorpromazine prevents the development of uvb inflammation in the
mouse. like other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
agents,  xxxd2403xxx  is phototoxic in the uva range
but also photoprotective in the uvb range (10).
this molecule is so phototoxic that it would be safer
to avoid its use without adding a high-uva protection sunscreen.
