abstract:
(2s,3r,4r,5s,6r)-2-(3-(4-ethoxybenzyl)-4-chlorophenyl)-6-hydroxymethyl-tetrahydro-2h-pyran-3,4,5-triol ( xxxd1808xxx ;
 xxxd1808xxx ) is a potent sodium-glucose cotransporter type ii
inhibitor in animals and humans and is currently under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. the preclinical characterization of  xxxd1808xxx , to allow compound selection and
prediction of pharmacological and dispositional behavior in the
clinic, involved caco-2 cell permeability studies, cytochrome
p450 (p450) inhibition and induction studies, p450 reaction phenotyping, metabolite identification in hepatocytes, and pharmacokinetics in rats, dogs, and monkeys.  xxxd1808xxx  was found
to have good permeability across caco-2 cell membranes. it
was found to be a substrate for p-glycoprotein (p-gp) but not a
significant p-gp inhibitor.  xxxd1808xxx  was not found to be an

inhibitor or an inducer of human p450 enzymes. the in vitro
metabolic profiles of  xxxd1808xxx  after incubation with hepatocytes from mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans were qualitatively similar. rat hepatocyte incubations showed the highest
turnover, and  xxxd1808xxx  was most stable in human hepatocytes. prominent in vitro metabolic pathways observed were
glucuronidation, hydroxylation, and o-deethylation. pharmacokinetic parameters for  xxxd1808xxx  in preclinical species revealed a compound with adequate oral exposure, clearance, and
elimination half-life, consistent with the potential for single daily
dosing in humans. the pharmacokinetics in humans after a
single dose of 50 mg of [14c] xxxd1808xxx  showed good exposure, low clearance, adequate half-life, and no metabolites with
significant pharmacological activity or toxicological concern.

type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease prevalent around
the world, characterized by hyperglycemia caused by excessive
hepatic glucose production, a deficiency in insulin secretion,
and/or peripheral insulin resistance. as the disease advances, com-

plications result from the hyperglycemia, such as retinopathy,
neuropathy, nephropathy, and other macrovascular diseases (edelman, 1998; porte, 2001). although present antidiabetic agents can
achieve the needed reduction in plasma glucose, no single current
medication is optimal to achieve sustained glycemic control without side effects, such as hypoglycemia. the often necessary combination therapy also can generate additional side effects. for
example, treatment with thiazolidinediones (glitazones) in combination with insulin is related to an increased risk of congestive
heart failure as a result of edema events (nesto et al., 2004). there
are very few therapies, with the exception of the novel dipeptidyl

obermeier et al.
once c-glycoside  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors were identified as being pharmacologically attractive compounds, with very good selectivity for
the target and potency in both in vitro and in vivo assessments, studies
were conducted to characterize the in vitro absorption, metabolism,
drug-drug interaction potential, and pharmacokinetics in mice, rats,
dogs, and monkeys and to aid in compound selection. based on the
data from these evaluations,  xxxd1808xxx  was selected for progression into clinical trials, and the absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion (adme)-related data are presented here. as  xxxd1808xxx  progressed as the development candidate, a mass balance study
with radiolabeled  xxxd1808xxx  was conducted in healthy volunteers,
and some brief results from that study are also reported here.
materials and methods
chemicals and equipment.  xxxd1808xxx  and a chemical standard
corresponding to the o-deethylated metabolite (m8) were synthesized at
bristol-myers squibb co. (princeton, nj) and were at least 99% pure based
on high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) purity analysis. a
standard of hydroxylated metabolite (m12) was purified from a large-scale
incubation of  xxxd1808xxx  with rat liver microsomes. structural characterization data for  xxxd1808xxx  and synthesized or purified metabolites can
be found in the supplemental data. [14c] xxxd1808xxx  (specific activity of
2.07 ␮ci/mg and a radiochemical purity of 99.5%) was synthesized in the
bristol-myers squibb radiochemistry department (new brunswick, nj).

isolation. for analysis of radioactivity in samples from the hepatocyte
incubations used for metabolite identification, a topcount nxt microplate
scintillation and luminescence counter (perkinelmer life and analytical
sciences, waltham, ma) was used.

peptidase 4 inhibition, that do not cause an increase in body weight
or risk of hypoglycemia (barnett, 2006). in addition, agents that
increase the production of insulin stress the pancreatic ␤ cells,
which results in eventual hypertrophy and loss of differentiation of
those cells, contributing to the progression of the disease (list et
al., 2009).
thus, the development of alternative agents acting by novel
mechanisms has become necessary to control glucose levels in
patients with progressing hyperglycemia (rotella, 2004; skyler,
2004; mohler et al., 2009). some emerging small molecules primarily lower blood glucose levels by modulating targets that affect
glucose metabolism (glucokinase, glycogen phosphorylase) or by
regulating glucose homeostasis (amp-activated protein kinase).
one such novel mechanism by which blood glucose levels can be
lowered is by removing glucose from the bloodstream via inhibition of the sodium glucose cotransporter (sglt).
under normal conditions, plasma glucose is filtered in the kidney glomerulus and in healthy individuals is almost totally (99%)
reabsorbed (deetjen et al., 1992). this reabsorption process is
mediated by two sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters:
 xxxg2140xxx  and  xxxg2141xxx .  xxxg2140xxx  is a low-capacity, high-affinity transporter expressed in the gut, heart, and kidney (wright et al., 1993),
and  xxxg2141xxx  is a high-capacity, low-affinity transporter expressed
mainly in the s1 segment of the proximal tubule of the nephron
(kanai et al., 1994). the  xxxg2141xxx  in the proximal tubule is estimated to facilitate approximately 90% of renal glucose reabsorption, and the remaining 10% is likely mediated by  xxxg2140xxx  that
resides in the distal s3 segment of the proximal tubule (wallner et
al., 2001).
nonselective sglt inhibitors have been described, such as the
natural product phlorizin (ehrenkranz et al., 2005), which is an
o-glucoside dihydrochalcone found in the root and bark of certain
fruit trees. phlorizin was not suitable for development as a drug
candidate because of low bioavailability and rapid clearance as a
consequence of hydrolysis by o-glucosidases present in the gut,
liver, and kidney. in addition, the finding that a defective  xxxg2140xxx 
transporter in the gut is responsible for glucose and galactose
malabsorption disorders in patients (turk et al., 1991) suggests that
pursuit of  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors exhibiting comparable (less than 10fold)  xxxg2140xxx  selectivity to phlorizin would increase the risk of
unacceptable diarrhea.
selective inhibition of  xxxg2141xxx  has been proposed to aid in the
normalization of plasma glucose levels in diabetic patients by
preventing the renal glucose reabsorption process and promoting
glucose excretion in urine (oku et al., 1999).  xxxd1808xxx  is a
potent, selective  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitor in vitro and also shows increased
glucose excretion and highly efficacious plasma glucose lowering
in preclinical species (han et al., 2008; meng et al., 2008).  xxxd1808xxx  is not only selective for  xxxg2141xxx  (1200-fold over  xxxg2140xxx )
but also is more metabolically stable than previously described
sglt inhibitors because it is a c-glucoside rather than an oglucoside (ellsworth et al., 2008; meng et al., 2008). proof-ofconcept and phase 2b studies in patients with type 2 diabetes have
been conducted with various doses of  xxxd1808xxx  and published
previously (komoroski et al., 2009a,b; list et al., 2009).  xxxd1808xxx  exhibits an insulin-independent mechanism of action, providing both short-term and longer-term (hba1c levels) efficacy
(list et al., 2009). in studies with the sglt inhibitor phlorizin,
this insulin-independent mechanism was shown to alleviate the
loss of ␤ cell function, normalizing the blood glucose levels
without increasing plasma insulin or changing levels of nonesterified  xxxd2154xxx  in plasma (jonas et al., 1999).

in vitro metabolism and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1808xxx 

dialysis was conducted in triplicate for 4 h at 37°c. aliquots of plasma
dialysates were analyzed using an lc/ms/ms method. the unbound fraction
(fu) was calculated as the concentration of  xxxd1808xxx  in the plasma dialysate
divided by the concentration in the spiked plasma. values are reported as
mean ⫾ s.d. for three determinations.
serum protein binding. the in vitro protein binding of  xxxd1808xxx  in
monkey serum was determined by ultrafiltration using centrifree up devices
with a molecular mass cutoff of ⬎30,000 da (millipore corporation, billerica,
ma).  xxxd1808xxx  (1 mm in acn) was added to serum in triplicate to yield
final concentrations of 10 ␮m. the serum binding study was conducted at
room temperature. after the spiked serum samples were added to the filtration
devices, they were centrifuged at a 33° fixed angle for 15 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000g.
aliquots of serum ultrafiltrate were analyzed using an lc/ms/ms method.
the fu was calculated as the concentration of  xxxd1808xxx  in the serum
ultrafiltrate divided by the concentration in the spiked serum. values are
reported as mean ⫾ s.d. for three determinations.
blood cell partitioning.  xxxd1808xxx  (1 mm in acn) was added to
samples of rat, dog, and monkey blood in triplicate to yield final concentrations
of 10 ␮m. samples were incubated in triplicate at 37°c in a shaking water bath
for 2 h. for testing in human blood, 0.5 mm  xxxd1808xxx  in acn/water (1:1,
v/v) was added to samples of human blood in triplicate to yield a final
concentration of 5 ␮m, and these samples were incubated at 37°c in an
incubator containing 95% o2/5% co2 for 2 h. aliquots of blood were removed
at 2 h and split into two portions. one portion was treated with an equal volume
of water and centrifuged to obtain supernatant. the remaining blood was
centrifuged to obtain plasma. samples were analyzed using lc/ms/ms. a
blood/plasma partitioning ratio for  xxxd1808xxx  was calculated from the
concentrations in blood and plasma.
p450 inhibition studies in pooled hlms. a stock solution (30 mm) was
prepared by dissolving  xxxd1808xxx  in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) and was
stored at 2 to 8°c before preparation of solutions of  xxxd1808xxx  at concentrations of 0, 0.0045, 0.018, 0.09, 0.36, 1.8, 9, and 45 ␮m. to determine the
ic50 values, hlms (lot bms022 pooled from 19 individuals and lot 27
pooled from 38 individuals; 0.05– 0.25 mg/ml microsomal protein) were incubated in triplicate as described previously (yao et al., 2007).
p450 induction studies in hepatocytes and sample analysis. primary cultures of human hepatocytes were prepared at cellzdirect (pittsboro, nc) from
human liver tissue from three donors (hu472, hu476, and hu477). the p450
induction studies were conducted by cellzdirect, and a brief description of the
study is shown below. a fresh stock solution of  xxxd1808xxx  was prepared in
dmso on the first day of dosing. stock solutions were diluted daily in
modified chee’s medium to achieve the final dosing concentrations of 0.2, 2,
and 20 ␮m for  xxxd1808xxx  and a final dmso concentration of 0.1%.
primary human hepatocytes were prepared from human liver tissue from three
donors. hepatocytes were isolated by a collagenase perfusion method described previously (lecluyse et al., 2005). final cell viability before plating
was determined by the trypan blue exclusion test and was greater than 75% in
all the cases.
hepatocyte cultures were treated for 3 consecutive days with medium
containing  xxxd1808xxx  (0.2, 2, and 20 ␮m), solvent (0.1% dmso) controls,
or prototypical inducers. rifampicin (10 ␮m), phenobarbital (1 mm), and
3-methylcholanthrene (2 ␮m) were the prototypical inducers used as positive
controls for the human hepatocyte cultures. both daily microscopic inspections
of the cultures and monolayers and monitoring of lactate dehydrogenase
leakage were used as a measure of cytotoxicity. for rna determination, cells
under identical conditions were incubated for 48 h. no cytotoxicity (changes
in cell morphology or attachment) was observed during the incubation period.
after the 3-day treatment with test article and controls, cultures of hepatocytes
from each treatment group were rinsed twice with ice-cold hanks’ balanced
salt solution. homogenization buffer (50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.0, 150 mm kcl,
2 mm edta) was added to each dish (0.5 ml/dish), and cells were scraped
with a cell scraper. harvested cells from each treatment were pooled and
sonicated with a vibra-cell probe sonicator (sonics and materials, danbury,
ct) at 40 w for 15 to 20 s. cell lysates were centrifuged at 9000g for 20 min
at 4°c. supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 100,000g for 60 min at
4°c. final microsomal pellets were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose with a
potter-elvehjem style homogenizer fitted with a teflon pestle. a small aliquot
was taken for protein determination (bicinchoninic acid protein assay), and all

bristol-myers squibb institutional animal care and use committee. adult
male sprague-dawley rats (200 –283 g) were obtained from harlan (indianapolis, in). rats were surgically prepared with indwelling jugular vein
cannulas (oral animals) or indwelling jugular vein cannulas and carotid
artery cannulas (intra-arterial animals) 1 day before drug administration.
adult male beagle dogs (11.6 –14.8 kg) were from an in-house colony.
those that received the intravenous doses had chronically implanted femoral vein access ports. adult male cynomolgus monkeys (6.2–7.1 kg) were
from an in-house colony. all the monkeys used had chronically implanted
femoral vein access ports. all the animals were fasted overnight before
dosing and were fed 4 h after dosing. all the animals had free access to
water and were conscious throughout the study.
drug. for all the pharmacokinetic studies in animals,  xxxd1808xxx  was
formulated in  xxxd2982xxx /water/ethanol (45:45:10, v/v/v) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.
drug treatment. two groups of three rats each were given a single oral or
intra-arterial dose of  xxxd1808xxx  (1 mg/kg). a single dose of  xxxd1808xxx 
(6.6 mg/kg) was administered orally and intravenously to three beagle dogs in
a crossover fashion. in an analogous crossover study,  xxxd1808xxx  (6 mg/kg)
was administered orally and intravenously to three cynomolgus monkeys.
sampling. for rats, blood samples were collected from the jugular vein
cannulas  xxxd1891xxx  and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after both the intra-arterial
and oral administration. for dogs and monkeys, blood samples were collected
from the jugular vein  xxxd1891xxx , 15, 30, and 45 min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 32, and
48 h after intravenous administration and at 15, 30, and 45 min and 1, 2, 4, 6,
8, 12, 24, 32, and 48 h after oral administration. all the blood samples were
collected into syringes containing k3edta salt. the plasma fraction was
immediately separated by centrifugation (14,000g, 10 min, 4°c), frozen on dry
ice, and stored at ⫺20°c until the samples were analyzed. for dogs and
monkeys, urine was also collected over the duration of the study. plasma and
urine samples were treated with 2 volumes of acetonitrile (acn) containing
internal standard. after centrifugation to remove precipitated proteins, an
aliquot of supernatant was analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectroscopy (lc/ms/ms).
clinical study. the protocol, amendments, and informed consent for this
study were approved by the institutional review board/ independent ethics
committee and conducted in accordance with good clinical practices. six
healthy adult males were enrolled in an open-label, nonrandomized, singledose study. subjects were given a single oral dose of 50 mg of [14c] xxxd1808xxx  solution, containing approximately 125 ␮ci of total radioactivity (tra).
the dose volume was 10 ml (5 mg/ml in  xxxd2982xxx /water, 30:70, v/v)
of solution and was followed by the administration of 240 ml of water. blood
samples were collected from an indwelling catheter or by direct venipuncture
into tubes containing k2edta at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,
24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 264, 288, and 312 h. blood
samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 1000g to obtain plasma and stored at
⫺20°c until analysis for tra and  xxxd1808xxx  concentrations by a validated
lc/ms/ms method. additional blood samples were obtained at 1, 4, 12, 48,
and 144 h after the dose for biotransformation analysis. urine and feces were
also collected. urine was collected in chilled urine collection jugs and stored
refrigerated during the collection period (0 –12 and 12–24 h on day 1 and then
every 24 h on subsequent days). aliquots taken for tra and drug analysis and
remaining bulk urine were stored at ⫺70°c until analysis.
in vitro studies. caco-2 permeability studies and p-glycoprotein interaction studies. caco-2 cells were seeded onto 12-well polycarbonate filter membrane at a density of 60,000 cells/cm2. the permeability studies were conducted as described previously (kamath et al., 2008) but with the addition of
a potent inhibitor of p-glycoprotein (p-gp; gf120918, 4 ␮m) to both the apical
and the basolateral compartments in the bidirectional permeability studies. the
ability of  xxxd1808xxx  to inhibit p-gp was evaluated by assessing the inhibition of the transport of digoxin, a p-gp substrate, through caco-2 cell monolayers and was conducted as described previously (kamath et al., 2008).
plasma protein binding. the protein binding of  xxxd1808xxx  in rat, dog,
and human plasma was determined in a 96-well equilibrium dialysis apparatus
using dialysis membranes with a 12,000- to 14,000-da molecular mass cutoff
(htdialysis, llc, gales ferry, ct). the dialysis buffer was 0.133 m sodium
phosphate buffer, ph 7.4. plasma (previously frozen) was spiked with  xxxd1808xxx  (1 mm in acn) to achieve final concentrations of 10 ␮m. the

held for 2 min, and then re-equilibrated to 10% acn over 10 min. the hplc
eluent was split, with 20% going to the mass spectrometer and 80% collected
for topcount scintillation counting (perkinelmer life and analytical sciences). the fraction collection interval on the topcount was every 15 s.
profiles were prepared by plotting net counts per minute (cpm) values (cpm
from column void volume were subtracted from cpm of subsequent fractions)
against retention time. for analysis of positive controls in the hepatocyte study,
the same hplc system was used as above but with a ymc ods aq c18
(2.0 ⫻ 50 mm, 3 ␮m) column.
for the purification of m12 from a rat microsomal incubation, extract
samples dissolved in dmso were analyzed on an hplc system equipped with
an asi-100 autosampler injector (dionex, sunnyvale, ca), a uvd 340 uv
detector (dionex), two varian prep star mode 218 pumps (varian inc., palo
alto, ca), and an isco foxy 200 fraction collector (teledyne isco, lincoln,
ne). the column used was a ymc ods-aq, 20 ⫻ 150 mm, s5 (waters), and
a flow rate of 10 ml/min was used. an acn/water gradient system was used
for the separation. the amount of acn in the gradient was increased in a
stepwise fashion starting with 10% acn held for 5 min, then to 32% acn
over 2 min, held at 32% acn for 13 min, and then re-equilibrated to 10%
acn. m12 eluted around 17 min in this system. fractions containing m12
were pooled and lyophilized.
for the analysis of  xxxd1808xxx  in preclinical samples, the hplc system
consisted of two shimadzu lc10ad pumps, a perkinelmer life and analytical sciences pe series 200 autosampler, and a hewlett packard (palo alto,
ca) series 1100 heated column compartment. the column used was a
prontosil c30 column, 2 ⫻ 50 mm, 5-␮m particles (mac-mod analytical,
inc., chadds ford, pa), maintained at 60°c. plasma and urine samples were
treated with 3 volumes of acn (containing a proprietary bristol-myers squibb
compound as an internal standard), vortexed, centrifuged at 2500g for 10 min,
and 10 ␮l of supernatant was injected onto the lc/ms. the solvent systems
used for the separation were composed of acn and ammonium acetate (10
mm) in water. the amount of acn in the gradient was increased in a stepwise
fashion from 0% acn to 100% acn over 6 min, held for 1.5 min, and then
re-equilibrated to 0% acn over 1 min. the hplc was interfaced to a
micromass triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (micromass, manchester, uk)
equipped with an electrospray interface. data acquisition used multiple reaction monitoring. positively charged ions representing the [m⫹nh4]⫹ for
 xxxd1808xxx  and [m⫹h]⫹ for the internal standard were selected in ms1 and
collisionally dissociated with argon to form specific product ions that were
subsequently monitored by ms2. the transitions monitored were m/z
4263167 for  xxxd1808xxx  (es⫹) and m/z 4593427 for the internal standard.
the blood cell partitioning study with human blood was run at a later time,
and the analysis of those samples used an hplc system consisting of two
shimadzu lc10ad pumps and a leap technologies (carrboro, nc) htc
pal autosampler. the column used was a yms ods (2 ⫻ 50 mm, 3-␮m
particles; waters) maintained at room temperature. samples were treated with
two volumes of acn containing [13c6] xxxd1808xxx , vortexed, and centrifuged at 2500g for 20 min at 4°c. aliquots of 150 ␮l in duplicate were
transferred to a 96-well shallow filter plate (millipore corporation), which was
preloaded with 75 ␮l of acn and stacked with a 96-deep well receiver plate.
after centrifugation, 250 ␮l of water was added to the receiver plate and mixed
with the filtrate. the supernatant (10 ␮l) was injected onto the lc/ms. the
solvent systems used for the separation were composed of acn and water. the
amount of acn in the gradient was increased in a stepwise fashion from 20%
acn to 80% acn over 2.5 min, held for 0.3 min, and then re-equilibrated to
20% acn over 1.2 min. the hplc was interfaced to a 4000 q trap hybrid
triple-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a turbo v
source (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) and run in negative ionization
mode. data acquisition used multiple reaction monitoring. negatively charged
ions representing the [m-h]⫺ for  xxxd1808xxx  were selected in ms1 and
collisionally dissociated with argon to form specific product ions that were
subsequently monitored by ms2. the transitions monitored were m/z
4073329 for  xxxd1808xxx  (es⫺) and m/z 4133323 for [13c6] xxxd1808xxx 
(internal standard).
for the analysis of  xxxd1808xxx  in the clinical samples, the hplc system
consisted of two shimadzu lc10ad pumps and a perkinelmer life and
analytical sciences pe series 200 autosampler. samples were extracted from
human plasma and urine using a waters oasis hlb solid-phase extraction well

downloaded from dmd.aspetjournals.org at aspet journals on december 29, 2014

the samples were stored at ⫺70°c. microsomes were diluted in 100 mm
potassium phosphate buffer at ph 7.4, spiked with marker substrate, and were
equilibrated to 37°c. total incubation volumes were approximately 0.5 ml,
and all the incubations were performed in triplicate. metabolic reactions were
initiated by the addition of nadph (1 mm final concentration) and stopped at
the indicated time points by addition of organic solvent. samples were then
extracted and analyzed for acetaminophen, hydroxybupropion, and 6␤hydroxytestosterone.
after a 48-h incubation, cells from each treatment group were washed with
hanks’  xxxd2988xxx , lysed with rlt buffer (qiagen, valencia,
ca) and 1% ␤- xxxd26xxx , harvested, and stored at ⫺70°c until rna
analysis was done. rna was isolated using the rneasy kits (qiagen), and
total rna was quantified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer (thermo
fisher scientific, waltham, ma).
hepatocyte incubations. a stock solution of [14c] xxxd1808xxx  (5.6 mm)
was prepared in ethanol. [14c] xxxd1808xxx , at a concentration of 30 ␮m, was
incubated with fresh hepatocytes from mouse and cryopreserved hepatocytes
from rat, dog, monkey, and human for 3 h. a cell concentration of 1 million
cells/ml was used. control substrates 7-ethoxycoumarin and 7-hydroxycoumarin were incubated for 1 h at concentrations of 100 ␮m. trypan blue exclusion
was used to assess viability. the incubations were carried out in krebshenseleit buffer, ph 7.4, for 3 h in a 37°c chamber that was maintained under
an oxygen/carbon dioxide (95:5) and 95% humidity atmosphere. at the end of
the incubation, 2 volumes of acn were added to each sample. the samples
were centrifuged at 2500g for 10 min. a 100-␮l portion of the supernatant was
analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (lc/ms) and scintillation counting. extent of metabolism of  xxxd1808xxx  was calculated by
comparing  xxxd1808xxx  concentration at 0 h versus 3 h. cell viability and
control substrate turnover were within acceptable limits.
rat liver microsomal incubation to produce m12. a stock solution of
 xxxd1808xxx  was prepared in acn.  xxxd1808xxx , at a concentration of 0.98
mm, was incubated at 37°c for 5 h in a 250-ml mixture containing 0.1 m
potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, 4.9 mm mgcl2, 6 mm nadph, 0.48
mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , 580 units/ml catalase, and 2 mg/ml protein of
pooled rat liver microsomes. the incubation mixture was extracted three times
with ethyl acetate (300 ml, 200 ml, and then 200 ml). the combined ethyl
acetate extract was evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator, and the
residue was dissolved in 3 ml of dmso. after removal of insoluble material
by centrifugation (12,000g for 3 min), the dmso solution was subjected to
semipreparative hplc separation.
analysis. samples from the caco-2 permeability studies were analyzed on
an hplc system that consisted of the 2690 waters separation module and a
waters 996 photodiode array detector (waters, milford, ma). the column
used was ymc octyl  xxxd3215xxx  (ods)-aq 4.6 ⫻ 150 mm, 3-␮m particle,
maintained at 25°c, and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. caco-2 samples (100 ␮l) were
injected without any sample preparation. an acn/water gradient system was
used for the separation. the amount of acn in the gradient was increased in
a stepwise fashion from 5% acn to 90% acn over 6 min, held for 7 min, then
re-equilibrated to 5% acn over 5 min. the mobile phases also contained
0.115% trifluoroacetic acid. quantitation was based on the uv peak area of
 xxxd1808xxx  (at 210 nm) in the samples.
analysis of the metabolites from the probe substrates used in the microsomal incubations was conducted using assays that were developed and validated
at bristol-myers squibb co. (yao et al., 2007). quantitation of the metabolites
from the three probe substrates used in the p450 induction studies was
conducted as described previously (lecluyse et al., 2005).
the analysis of metabolite profiles in hepatocytes was conducted on an
hplc system that consisted of two shimadzu lc10ad pumps, a model scl
system controller, a model sil 10 ad autoinjector, and a model spd m10a
diode-array detector (shimadzu scientific instruments, inc., columbia, md).
the column used was zorbax c18 (4.6 ⫻ 250 mm, 5 ␮m) column (agilent
technologies, santa clara, ca) run at ambient temperature and a flow rate of
0.8 ml/min. hepatocyte samples were treated with two volumes of acn,
vortexed, centrifuged at 2500g for 10 min, and 25 ␮l of supernatant was
injected onto the lc/ms. the solvent systems used for the separation were
composed of acn and ammonium acetate (10 mm) in water containing 0.1%
 xxxd2154xxx . the amount of acn in the gradient was increased in a stepwise
fashion from 10% acn to 45% acn over 35 min, to 60% acn over 5 min,

in vitro metabolism and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1808xxx 

the total area. the total apparent (oral) body clearance was calculated using
cl/oral bioavailability (f) ⫽ dose/auc. the calculated half-life is after an
oral dose.
for the clinical urine samples, the percentage of total radioactivity excreted
in the urine was calculated as described above based on the total radioactive
dose. for  xxxd1808xxx  excretion, chromatographic separation of the  xxxd1808xxx  and scintillation counting was described in the above sections, and the
percentage of dose excreted was calculated as described above.
prediction of cl and cl/f in humans. allometric scaling was used to
estimate the human clearance of  xxxd1808xxx  by using the body weight of the
animal and the corresponding clearance values. the animal clearance values
after correction for interspecies differences in plasma protein binding (data not
shown) were also used and that predicted clearance compared with the value
from simple allometry. to compare the predicted clearance from allometry
with the apparent clearance after an oral dose, the predicted clearance was
divided by the average oral bioavailability of the animal species (64%).

results
caco-2 permeability and p-gp interactions. the permeability
coefficient of  xxxd1808xxx  in the apical (a) to basolateral (b) direction was 60 nm/s at an initial concentration of 50 ␮m at ph 7.4. this
value is comparable with compounds that exhibit moderate absorption
in humans (marino et al., 2005). under the same conditions, the
average b-to-a permeability coefficient value of  xxxd1808xxx  was
227 nm/s (ba/ab ratio of 3.8). in the presence of a p-gp inhibitor, the
a-to-b permeability of  xxxd1808xxx  was 159 nm/s, and the b-to-a
permeability was 188 nm/s (ba/ab ratio decreased to 1.2). the
ba/ab ratio of 3.8 and the decrease of p-gp-mediated efflux (in the
presence of a p-gp inhibitor) suggest that  xxxd1808xxx  may be a p-gp
substrate.
to evaluate whether  xxxd1808xxx  inhibits the transport of p-gp
substrates, the permeability of digoxin was measured across caco-2
cell monolayers in the presence and absence of  xxxd1808xxx   xxxd1891xxx 
␮m.  xxxd1808xxx  showed weak inhibition of digoxin transport (10%
 xxxd1891xxx  ␮m). the inhibition value for verapamil (a known p-gp inhibitor) was 65%  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m in this experiment. these results suggest the
 xxxd1808xxx  is unlikely to be a p-gp inhibitor.
plasma and serum protein binding. the plasma protein binding
of  xxxd1808xxx  was determined by the equilibrium dialysis technique
 xxxd1891xxx  ␮m and was found to be 95, 93, and 91% in rat, dog, and human,
respectively. the serum protein binding of  xxxd1808xxx  in cynomolgus monkeys was determined by the ultrafiltration technique  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m
and was found to be 91%. control studies established that  xxxd1808xxx  was stable in rat, dog, monkey, and human serum  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m for
4 h at 37°c.
blood cell partitioning. the blood/plasma ratios were found to be
0.71, 0.61, 0.73, and 0.88 in rat, dog, monkey, and human, respectively. these ratios reflect limited distribution of  xxxd1808xxx  to red
blood cells.
results from p450 inhibition in hlm.  xxxd1808xxx  showed no
relevant direct inhibitory effects on the activities of cyp1a2,
 xxxg582xxx ,  xxxg583xxx ,  xxxg586xxx , cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6, and
cyp3a4, as the ic50 values were estimated to be greater than the
highest concentration of  xxxd1808xxx  evaluated (45 ␮m). the various
known inhibitors that were incubated with the different p450 enzymes
did show the expected inhibitory responses (data not shown).
p450 induction in human hepatocytes. there was no marked
induction of cyp1a2,  xxxg583xxx , or cyp3a4 when monitored by
mrna or enzyme activity observed for  xxxd1808xxx  at the concentrations tested (0.2–20 ␮m). the mrna analysis and the enzyme
activity revealed robust (10 –26-fold) increases in hepatocyte cultures
treated with positive controls (3-methylcholanthrene, phenobarbital,

plate. one hundred fifty microliters of plasma sample was pipetted into a
96-well plate, and then 50 ␮l of internal standard solution ([13c6] xxxd1808xxx 
in acn) and 200 ␮l of water were added. the waters oasis solid phase
extraction plate was conditioned according to manufacturer directions. samples were loaded into the extraction wells, followed by 400 ␮l of water and
then 400 ␮l of 10% methanol in water. samples were eluted with 2 ⫻ 300 ␮l
of acn. eluate was evaporated at 40°c under nitrogen and reconstituted in
100 ␮l of 0.1% ammonium hydroxide in 10% acn in water. the sample was
vortexed, centrifuged at 1500g for 3 min, and 10 ␮l of supernatant was injected
onto the hplc. the chromatographic separation was carried out on a sunfire
c18 column, 2.1 ⫻ 50 mm, 5-␮m particles (waters), and run at ambient
temperature. the solvent systems used for the separation were composed of
acn and water. the amount of acn in the gradient was increased in a
stepwise fashion from 20% acn to 30% over 0.5 min, then to 80% acn over
2.5 min, held for 0.3 min, then re-equilibrated to 20% acn over 0.2 min, and
held for 1 min. the hplc was interfaced to a quattro ultima mass spectrometer (waters) equipped with an electrospray interface and run in negative
ionization mode. data acquisition used selective reaction monitoring. the
transitions monitored were the same as those for the human blood cell partitioning study.
plasma samples at 1, 4, and 12 h were profiled for metabolites using the
same hplc procedure as for the hepatocyte incubations [the total radioactivity
measurements were below quantifiable limit ( xxxd1989xxx ) after 24 h; therefore, the
48- and 144-h samples were not profiled]. the plasma samples were loaded
into the extraction wells, followed by 400 ␮l of water, and then 2 ⫻ 400 ␮l of
10% methanol in water. samples were eluted with 2 ⫻ 400 ␮l of methanol.
the eluted fractions were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and reconstituted in 400 ␮l of methanol/water (25:75, v/v). after centrifugation, a 100-␮l
portion was analyzed by hplc for biotransformation profiling and mass
spectral analysis. radioactivity at the retention time correlating to the glucuronide conjugate of  xxxd1808xxx  m15 was also quantified and converted to
concentration using a specific activity of 2.07 ␮ci/mg. total radioactivity was
determined in these plasma samples by liquid scintillation counting.
pharmacokinetic data analysis. all the plasma concentration versus time
data of  xxxd1808xxx  were analyzed by noncompartmental methods (gibaldi,
1982) using the kinetica software program (version 4.2; thermo fisher
scientific). for the analysis of preclinical samples, the area under the concentration/time curve (auc)0-n and auctot values were calculated using a combination of linear and log trapezoidal summations. the total body clearance
(cl), mean residence time (mrt), half-life (t1/2), and steady-state volume of
distribution (vss) were calculated using noncompartmental methods after
intravenous administration: cl ⫽ dose/auct; mrt ⫽ area under the moment
curve/auc; t1/2 ⫽ mrt 䡠 0.693; and vss ⫽ cl 䡠 mrt. plasma clearance
values were corrected for blood to plasma ratios, experimentally obtained in
the various species, to compare blood clearance values with standard values for
liver blood flow reported in the literature (davies and morris, 1993). the vss
values were compared with total body water reported for the various species
(davies and morris, 1993). the absolute oral bioavailability (expressed as
percentage) was estimated by comparing the ratio of dose-normalized auc
values after oral doses with those after intravenous doses. to obtain the
percentage of dose excreted in urine, the amount of  xxxd1808xxx  excreted in
the urine in a given time interval was divided by the total dose given and
multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage of dose excreted in that interval. to
calculate renal clearance (clr), the amount of drug excreted in the urine over
a 24-h period was divided by aucpo and was compared with glomerular
filtration rate (gfr) 䡠 fu to assess whether net active renal transport was present
(if clr ⬎ gfr 䡠 fu, net renal secretion is suggested; if clr ⬍ gfr 䡠 fu, net
renal absorption is suggested). gfr values for the different species were
obtained from the literature (davies and morris, 1993).
for the analysis of clinical samples, the slopes of the terminal phases of the
plasma  xxxd1808xxx  and plasma tra concentration-time profiles, ␭, were
determined by log-linear regression of at least three data points that yielded a
minimum mean square error. the absolute values of ␭ were used to estimate
the apparent terminal half-lives of plasma  xxxd1808xxx  and plasma tra by
t1/2 ⫽ 2/␭. the areas under the plasma  xxxd1808xxx  and tra concentrationtime curves from zero extrapolated to infinite time, auctot, were calculated by
log- and linear-trapezoidal summations over the collection time, with the last
quantifiable plasma concentration being divided by ␭ and the product added to

glucuronide conjugate arising after o-deethylation of  xxxd1808xxx .
lc/ms/ms could not reveal the site of conjugation as being the
phenol moiety. lc/ms/ms data could not be obtained for metabolite
m4, in part because of its low abundance in rodent hepatocytes.
metabolite m8 was identified as the o-deethylated phenol arising
from dealkylation of  xxxd1808xxx  because it exhibited the same
retention time, m/z of 398 for the ammonia adduct, and mass spectra
as those of the authentic phenol standard (bms-511926). m10 was
tentatively identified as a glucuronide conjugate of  xxxd1808xxx 
because the ammonia adduct of m10 had an m/z of 602, and lc/
ms/ms analysis revealed a product ion at m/z of 391 arising from loss
of 176 da (suggestive of a glucuronide moiety) and 35 da (⫺nh3,
⫺h2o). m12 was tentatively identified as a hydroxylation product of
 xxxd1808xxx  because the ammonia adduct of m12 had an m/z of 442,
and lc/ms/ms analysis showed product ions at m/z 407 from loss of
35 da. purification of the material from a large-scale incubation of
 xxxd1808xxx  with rat liver microsomes allowed identification of the
metabolite as a product of benzylic hydroxylation (bms-639432),
although the stereochemistry at the site of modification was not
assigned. m15 was also identified as a glucuronide conjugate of
 xxxd1808xxx  because the ammonia adduct of m15 had an m/z of 602,
and an lc/ms/ms analysis showed product ions at m/z 409 from a
loss of 193 da, which was because of a loss of nh3 (17 da) and
glucuronide (176 da). the ammonia adduct of m15a had an m/z of
442 (16 mass units greater than the ammonia adduct of  xxxd1808xxx ),
which appeared to be an oxidative metabolite, but were not otherwise
characterized. the ammonia adduct of m16 had an m/z of 440 (14
mass units greater than the ammonia adduct of  xxxd1808xxx ). from
its mass spectra, the cleavage of the sugar ring to form an m/z of 289
confirms that the oxidation could only occur on the hydroxymethyl
group of the sugar ring. thus, m16 was tentatively identified as an
oxidative metabolite of  xxxd1808xxx . this peak was not adequately
separated from  xxxd1808xxx  to allow quantification; however, it was
judged to be very minor in a separate analysis of select samples with
radioflow detection. structures for the major metabolites, as well as
the position of the 14c-label, can be found in the metabolic pathway
shown in fig. 3.
pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of  xxxd1808xxx  after
single doses in rats, dogs, and monkeys. the main pharmacokinetic parameters for  xxxd1808xxx  for all the species tested are summarized in table 1, and the plasma profiles are shown in fig. 4. the
clearance values reported in table 1 are plasma clearance values,
which below are corrected for blood/plasma ratios, for comparison
with liver blood flows.
in the rat, the systemic blood clearance of  xxxd1808xxx  was 6.8 ⫾
0.8 ml/min/kg, which is ⬃12% of hepatic blood flow. the blood
clearance was calculated by dividing the plasma clearance by the
blood/plasma ratio; for rat those values were 4.8 ml/min/kg and a ratio
of 0.71. the vss was high (1.6 ⫾ 0.1 l/kg) compared with 0.7 l/kg for
total body water in the rat, indicating extravascular distribution. the
estimated elimination half-life after intra-arterial administration was
4.6 ⫾ 0.8 h, and the mean residence time was 5.6 ⫾ 0.9 h. the f of
 xxxd1808xxx  was 84%. the time to reach peak concentrations (tmax)
after an oral dose was 1.7 ⫾ 2.0 h.
in the dog, the systemic blood clearance of  xxxd1808xxx  was 2.5 ⫾
0.3 ml/min/kg, which is ⬃8% of hepatic blood flow in the dog. the
vss was 0.8 ⫾ 0.1 l/kg, similar to total body water in the dog (0.6
l/kg), indicating modest extravascular distribution. the estimated
elimination half-life after intravenous administration was 7.4 ⫾ 1.2 h,
and the mean residence time was 9.3 ⫾ 0.7 h. the f of  xxxd1808xxx 
was 83 ⫾ 2%. the tmax after an oral dose was 0.6 ⫾ 0.4 h. the

metabolite profiles from hepatocyte incubations. metabolite
profiles of [14c] xxxd1808xxx  after incubation for 3 h with hepatocyte
preparations from mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human are shown in
fig. 1.  xxxd1808xxx  was the major peak in all the hepatocyte incubations. the extent of turnover of  xxxd1808xxx  in hepatocytes was
50% in rat, 26% in mouse, 24% in dog, 25% in monkey, and 10% in
human. all the metabolites observed in human hepatocyte incubations
were also observed in the animal incubations. in human hepatocytes,
m15 was the major metabolite, accounting for 2.1% of the total
radioactivity in the sample, with all the other metabolites accounting
for ⬍0.9% of the total radioactivity.
metabolites formed in incubations with hepatocytes were characterized by lc/ms/ms. the mass spectra of  xxxd1808xxx  and metabolites m8, m12, and m15 are shown in fig. 2. the evidence for the
assignment of the structure of each metabolite is discussed below.
 xxxd1808xxx  gave an ammonia adduct (m⫹nh4)⫹ and had an m/z of
426 da. lc/ms/ms analysis showed product ions resulting from
sequential losses of water: at m/z 391 from loss of 35 (⫺h2o, ⫺nh3),
at m/z 373 from loss of h2o (18 da), and at m/z 355 from loss of h2o
(18 da). this retention time and mass spectra were identical to a
matched authentic standard of  xxxd1808xxx . based on the m/z of 574
for the m2 ammonia adduct (m⫹nh4)⫹, m2 was identified as a

in the monkey,  xxxd1808xxx  was cleared more quickly than in the
dog, with a systemic blood clearance of 8.8 ⫾ 3.1 ml/min/kg, approximately 20% of hepatic blood flow in the monkey. the vss was 0.8 ⫾
0.2 l/kg, similar to total body water (0.7 l/kg), indicating modest

intravenous administration was 3.5 ⫾ 1.9 h, and the mean residence

after an oral dose was 1.9 ⫾ 1.8 h. the percentage of dose excreted
in the urine as  xxxd1808xxx , over a 24-h period, was 3.8 ⫾ 0.3% after
an oral dose of 6 mg/kg. the clr was 5.7 ml/min, and gfr 䡠 fu was
0.9 ml/min.
prediction of pharmacokinetics in humans. the human systemic
plasma clearance was predicted to be 2.1 ml/min/kg from simple
allometry (cl ⫽ 4.26 䡠 body weight0.83, r2 ⫽ 0.87; fig. 5). using
the blood/plasma ratio of 0.88 in human serum, this is a blood
clearance of 2.4 ml/min/kg, corresponding to 11% of hepatic blood
flow. the plasma clearance, when divided by the average bioavailability across the animal species (64%), corresponds to a predicted
oral clearance of 3.3 ml/min/kg. the systemic plasma clearance value
after correction for protein binding was 1.9 ml/min/kg (oral clearance
of 3.0 ml/min/kg). correction of the plasma clearance with metabolism rates was not done, given the interspecies differences in metabolite profiles in hepatocytes.

ml/min, and gfr 䡠 fu was 10.8 ml/min.
figure 6 shows the plasma profile of  xxxd1808xxx  compared with
plasma profile of total radioactivity. the levels of total radioactivity
were approximately 3-fold higher than the levels of  xxxd1808xxx .
five time points (at 1, 4, 12, 48, and 144 h) were sampled for
biotransformation analysis.  xxxd1808xxx  and m15 levels were quantitated as described under materials and methods. time points after
96 h were  xxxd1989xxx  for  xxxd1808xxx . the total radioactivity measurements were  xxxd1989xxx  after 24 h. figure 7 shows the levels of  xxxd1808xxx 
and m15 compared with the total radioactivity at 1, 4, and 12 h. the
sum of  xxxd1808xxx  ⫹ m15 concentrations accounted for ⬎72% of
the total plasma radioactivity at all the time points.
discussion
optimal treatment for hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes still remains a major clinical challenge. inhibition of sglt offers great
potential as a novel mode of treating hyperglycemia, without some of
the common side effects and stress on ␤ cells; thus, progression of the
disease may possibly be altered with this class of drugs. because of
the side effects of nonselective inhibition of sglt and enzymatic
instability of o-glucoside inhibitors in many tissues, there is a medical
need for more hydrolytically stable c-glucosides that are sglt2selective, such as  xxxd1808xxx .

to aid in compound selection and to determine whether  xxxd1808xxx  was a suitable compound for progression into the clinic, the
pharmacokinetics in animals and important adme parameters were
obtained. the plasma clearance of  xxxd1808xxx  was low in the three
species investigated. the volume of distribution values ranged from
total body water in the dog and monkey to approximately 2-fold total
body water in the rat. the elimination half-lives were moderate in the
rat (4.6 h) and dog (7.4 h) but lower in the monkey (3.5 h). the plasma
and serum (monkey) protein binding for  xxxd1808xxx  was found to be
moderate to high, ranging from 91 to 95% in preclinical species and
91% in humans. bioavailability values ranged from ⬎80% in the rat
and dog to 25% in the monkey. the predicted oral clearance using the
clearance values from simple allometry was 3.3 ml/min/kg based on
an average bioavailability value calculated from the different species.
the intrinsic permeability seen for  xxxd1808xxx  across caco-2
cells was comparable with compounds that exhibit good absorption in
humans (marino et al., 2005) and would indicate good systemic
bioavailability of the compound after oral administration. the efflux
ratio of 3.8 seen in caco-2 cells suggests that  xxxd1808xxx  may be a

p-gp substrate, but it exhibits high intrinsic permeability in the caco-2
cells and good bioavailability in rats and dogs; thus, absorption and
bioavailability were predicted to be adequate in humans. it is possible
that the doses in rats and dogs were enough to saturate the p-gp
transporter at the level of the intestinal lumen and led to the observed
good bioavailability; however,  xxxd1808xxx  showed linear pharmacokinetics over a very large dose range in both species. therefore, it
is more likely that passive permeability dominates the absorption of
the compound. p-gp can play a role in drug disposition at the level of
the kidney (li et al., 2006). although the comparison of gfr 䡠 fu with
clr for monkeys and dogs does indicate that some active renal
processes may be occurring, it should be noted that the urinary
excretion of  xxxd1808xxx  is very low in all the species; thus, the
action of p-gp on the disposition of  xxxd1808xxx  at the renal level
may not be relevant. and although the bioavailability in the monkey
is much lower than in other species, factors other than renal transport
are governing the lower oral exposure.
in incubations with human hepatocytes, a glucuronide conjugate
(m15) of  xxxd1808xxx  was found to be the major metabolite. glucu-

ronides of  xxxd1808xxx  (m15 and m10) were also found in the animal
hepatocyte incubations.  xxxd1808xxx  was not found to be an inhibitor
or an inducer of p450 enzymes. the overall favorable adme properties of  xxxd1808xxx  in animals, the favorable predicted parameters
in humans, and the overall safety and efficacy of the compound in
preclinical testing led to the progression of the compound into clinical
trials (komoroski et al., 2009a,b; list et al.,2009).
 xxxd1808xxx , administered to healthy subjects as an oral solution
of 50 mg, was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with
tmax ⬍1 h and appeared to be safe and well tolerated. based on the
urinary recovery of total radioactivity in that study, the systemic
absorption of orally administered  xxxd1808xxx  was at least 75%
within 24 h of dosing (data not shown). thus, p-gp does not appear to
be limiting the absorption of  xxxd1808xxx  in humans. the urinary
excretion of (parent)  xxxd1808xxx  is very low; therefore, the contribution of renal clearance to the total clearance of  xxxd1808xxx  is very
small.
in plasma, the ratio of the  xxxd1808xxx  concentration to the tra
at any one time point was approximately 0.3 of tra, suggesting that

metabolites account for a significant portion of  xxxd1808xxx -related
compounds in the plasma. indeed, the major metabolite identified in
human hepatocytes was also found to be a major circulating metabolite in the clinical samples. this nonpharmacologically active glucuronide conjugate, m15 (further characterization to be discussed in a
future publication), was found in human plasma at concentrations
similar to  xxxd1808xxx . m15 was cleared similarly to  xxxd1808xxx  as
indicated by the comparable slopes of their elimination phases. levels
of m15 were significant in all the species used for toxicological
evaluation (data not shown) relative to levels in humans.
allometry rather than in vitro data was used to predict human
clearance for a number of reasons. clearance predictions from microsomal incubations with nadph, accounting for only oxidative metabolism, or from microsomal incubations with  xxxd534xxx 
were not done as the predicted clearance values often underpredict
observed values for drugs cleared by glucuronidation and are highly
dependent on incubation conditions (kilford et al., 2009). although
hepatocytes have been shown to produce better predictive results for
drugs cleared by glucuronidation, the preclinical studies with hepatocytes did not give enough  xxxd1808xxx  turnover to reliably determine
an intrinsic clearance. thus, allometry was used as a reasonable
alternative. the oral clearance (3.3 ml/min/kg) predicted from simple
allometry is close to the observed value (4.9 ml/min/kg); correcting
for protein binding resulted in a very similar prediction of oral
clearance (3.0 ml/min/kg).  xxxd1808xxx  is a low clearance compound
in humans.
in summary,  xxxd1808xxx  is a potent inhibitor of  xxxg2141xxx  and
shows a reduction in plasma glucose in animal models (han et al.,
2008; meng et al., 2008). the preclinical characteristics and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1808xxx  supported its progression into clinical
trials, with no unusual drug-drug interaction potential or distribution
properties being shown. this novel compound looks very promising
as an additional therapy for hyperglycemia, with the potential of
becoming a major therapy.
