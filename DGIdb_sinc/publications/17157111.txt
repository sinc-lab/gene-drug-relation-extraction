abstract

background: insomnia is a common sleep disorder
with a significant potential for deleterious effects on
activities of daily living, productivity, and overall
quality of life.  xxxd3078xxx , a highly selective agonist
for melatonin subtypes i and 2 receptors, is a hypnotic
agent approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep.
objectiv~ this article reviews the pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy, and tolerability of  xxxd3078xxx  in
the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty
falling asleep.
methods: relevant articles were identified through
searches of medline (1966 to july 2006), international pharmaceutical abstracts (january 1970 to
july 2006), embase drugs and pharmacology (1980
to third quarter 2006), and current contents/clinical
medicine (2005 week 32 to 2006 week 31). search
terms included  xxxd3078xxx , melatonin agonist, melatonin receptor agonist, insomnia, and sleep

disorders~drugtherapy (mesh).
results: a literature search revealed 12 randomized,
controlled clinical trials that examined the efficacy or
tolerability of  xxxd3078xxx . in addition, 17 studies were
reviewed for pharmacology and pharmacokinetic data.
the references of the clinical trials and recent review articles were examined to ensure the comprehensiveness
of the literature search. in 2 trials of patients with primary insomnia, patients treated with  xxxd3078xxx  4 to
32 mg had significant reductions in latency to persistent sleep (lps) compared with placebo (p < 0.001).
additionally, improvements in total sleep time (tst)
were observed (p < 0.001), although increases in tst
were noted only on nights 1-2 of the second study.
similarly, improvement in sleep efficiency was reported
only on nights 1-2 of the second trial (p < 0.001). in elderly patients with primary insomnia, significant reductions in subjective lps were observed with  xxxd3078xxx  4
and 8 mg (p = 0.008); however, average subjective lps

was >70 minutes. mean reported tst was significantly increased in the 4-mg group (p = 0.004). a second
study in elderly patients found decreases in lps with
 xxxd3078xxx  4 mg (p < 0.001) and 8 mg (p < 0.01), as
well as significant increases in tst (p < 0.05 and p <
0.01, respectively). sleep efficiency improved for patients treated with 4 mg (p < 0.05) and 8 mg (p < 0.01).
overall, the mean decrease in lps reported in trials of
 xxxd3078xxx  ranged from 10 to 19 minutes, and the mean
increase in tst was 8 to 22 minutes. the most common adverse events observed with  xxxd3078xxx  included
headache (7%), dizziness (5%), somnolence (5%), fatigue (4%), and nausea (3%). no evidence of cognitive
impairment, rebound insomnia, withdrawal effects, or
abuse potential was noted.
conclusions: based on this review,  xxxd3078xxx , the
first fda-approved melatonin receptor agonist, represents a pharmacologic option for the treatment of
insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep. in
patients with insomnia, treatment with  xxxd3078xxx  was
generally well tolerated and resulted in modest but
statistically significant decreases in lps. in the absence of published trials comparing  xxxd3078xxx  with
other sedative-hypnotic agents, it is not yet possible to
determine its efficacy relative to other therapeutic options for insomnia. (clin ther. 2006;28:1540-1555)

culty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or
experiencing nonrestorative sleep.2-s based on the
duration of symptoms, insomnia may be classified as
transient, short-term, or chronic. transient insomnia
occurs for a period of a few nights, and short-term
insomnia is characterized as insomnia lasting up to
4 weeks. 4,~ in general, transient and short-term insomnia are related to situational factors such as temporary stress, jet lag, or transitory medical or
psychological problems. 1,s insomnia lasting at least
1 month is categorized as chronic insomnia, and is
often the result of persistent medical conditions or
psychological disorders, such as sleep apnea, restless
leg syndrome, menopause, chronic pain, anxiety, depression, or substance abuse. 2-s in the absence of causative medical or substance abuse disorders, insomnia
resulting in significant impairment in social or occupational functioning for at least 1 month is consistent
with a diagnosis of primary insomnia. 2
according to a survey conducted by the national
sleep foundation in 2002, -58% of adults in the
united states experience some symptoms of insomnia
at least a few times per weekj other sources estimate
that insomnia occurs in -30% to 45% of adults. 2-4
the prevalence of primary insomnia is reported to be
1% to 10% in the general population, ranging up to
25% in the elderly.2 a significant number of individuals with insomnia report detrimental effects on activities of daily living (adls), including decreased attention and concentration, diminished motivation,
lack of energy, lower productivity, and increased irritability. 2,4,7 direct costs of insomnia are estimated to
be approximately (us, 1994) $14 billion each year,
and indirect costs due to work loss, accidents, and injuries may reach $28 billion. 1 because of its high
prevalence and the potential for adverse consequences
on adls and productivity, insomnia is a significant

overview of current therapy for insomnia
current treatment for insomnia includes both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. appropriate selection of anti-insomniac therapy should be
based on a number of factors, including the age of the
patient, concurrent medical conditions, current medications, and previous anti-insomniac treatment, s

nonpharmacologic options for patients with
chronic insomnia are based on behavioral therapy and
cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt). types of cbt
include stimulus control therapy, sleep-restriction
therapy, relaxation therapy, cognitive therapy, and
sleep-hygiene education. 1° examples of sleep hygiene
include maintaining a regular sleep-wake schedule;
avoiding excessive liquids and/or heavy evening
meals; establishing a regular exercise routine but not
exercising within 4 hours of bedtime; and minimizing
the use of caffeine, tobacco, or other stimulants,s
alternative activities, such as tai chi and yoga, have
also been used to facilitate relaxation. some insomniac patients use alcohol to help induce sleep; however,
generally this is not recommended because alcohol reduces the quality of sleep and may cause awakening
during the night.3
nine prescription medications, including  xxxd3078xxx ,
benzodiazepines (bzds), and non-bzds are fda approved for the treatment of insomnia.4 other pharmacologic agents used for the treatment of insomnia
include antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, barbiturates, and alternative medications (eg, melatonin, valerian root). table i compares 4 medication
classes that are used for sleep management: antidepressants, antihistamines, bzds, and non-bzds, wq3 the
lack of randomized controlled trials and head-to-head
studies and the short duration of most anti-insomniac
trials contribute to the deficiency of treatment algorithms and practice guidelines for the management of
insomnia.
currently,  xxxd1459xxx  receptor agonists are the agents
most commonly prescribed for the management of
insomnia. 14 this class is further divided into bzds
and non-bzds. both bzds and non-bzds bind to
the  xxxd1459xxx  component of the yoaminobutyric acid
(gaba)areceptor complex14; however, the non-bzds
may bind selectively to 0tl or 0g receptor subunits of
the complex. 11 these agents act by facilitating the
ability of gaba to cause neuronal inhibition by opening of the chloride channel.7 bzds fda approved for
insomnia include  xxxd2036xxx ,  xxxd2140xxx ,  xxxd3058xxx ,
temazepam, and triazolam. bzds alter the architecture of sleep by increasing the amount of time spent in
stage 2 sleep, but they diminish the time spent in stage
3-4 sleep. 13 overall, bzds decrease latency to persistent sleep (lps) and increase total sleep time (tst).
their efficacy in treating short-term insomnia and the
availability of generic agents make this class of hyp-

notic agents an attractive choice for the treatment of
insomnia.3,s,l°dl the risk for adverse events, such as
daytime sedation and potential for abuse, contributes
to the concerns clinicians have when prescribing these
medications.6,13
a comparison of the non- xxxd1459xxx  hypnotic agents
zolpidem, zaleplon, and  xxxd2047xxx  is shown in
table ii. ls-19 unlike the bzds, the non-bzds are less
likely to change sleep patterns because they have a
minimal effect on the percentage of time spent in stage
3-4 sleep. 14 all 3 agents have fda-approved labeling
for insomnia and should be initiated at the lowest
available dose in the elderly population. 1s-is zolpidem
and zaleplon are indicated for the short-term management of insomnia, and it is generally recommended
that these agents be prescribed for no more than
1 month at a time. ls,17 a controlled-release formulation of zolpidem is not subject to the same limitation
of duration of therapy.16  xxxd2047xxx  has been found
to have efficacy in clinical trials up to 6 months and is
also fda approved for use without a specific time
limit. 3,18 major limitations to the use of non-bzds are
cost19 and abuse potential. 11
sedation is a common adverse effect of certain antidepressants such as trazodone and the tricyclic class,
which makes these medications a viable option for the
treatment of insomnia. additionally, in many cases insomnia is secondary to depression, and an antidepressant with sedating qualities may be used to treat both
conditions. trazodone, a serotonin agonist at higher
doses (>150 mg/d) and a serotonin antagonist at lower
doses (25-50 mg/d), is the antidepressant most commonly prescribed for insomnia management,a2° the
sedative effects of trazodone and its ability to improve
sleep parameters are most pronounced within the first
2 weeks of treatment initiation. no published data are
available regarding the long-term use of trazodone
in the treatment of insomnia. other antidepressants
that have been prescribed for insomnia include
amitriptyline and mirtazapine2°; however, data concerning these medications in chronic insomnia are
lacking.
antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and doxylamine are common over-the-counter medications used
for insomnia.13 these histamine1 (h 0 receptor antagonists are known to cause sedation, drowsiness, and
cognitive impairment. increased dosages of antihistamines do not cause an increase in response rates. 13

ergic effects with antihistamines, this class should not
be considered as primary agents for elderly patients
with insomnia,a,la
antipsychotics such as quetiapine and olanzapine
have been studied in the treatment of insomnia; however, there are insufficient studies to determine their
value for short- or long-term therapy. adverse effects
of these agents, such as the metabolic syndrome,
weight gain, and hyperglycemia, render these agents
unfavorable for the treatment of insomnia.11
barbiturates such as pentobarbital and  xxxd3183xxx 
have fallen out of favor for the management of insomnia due to risks for overdose, tolerance, and drug interactions. at high doses they can cause respiratory
depression, and the risks for abuse and misuse of these
medications are higher compared with those for
newer agents.21
alternative medications, such as melatonin and
valerian root, are available. supplemental melatonin, in
a controlled-release 2-mg formulation, has been found
to improve the subjective sleep quality of elderly patients who were melatonin deficient.1a-z2 melatonin
may also positively impact the sleep quality of individuals who are not melatonin deficient, but it has been
found to have minimal impact on lps or tst in these
patients.22 concerns with melatonin include a lack of
specificity for melatonin subtypes 1 and 2 (mt 1 and
mt2) receptors, a short tl/2, a variation of preparations due to lack of regulation by the fda, and limited evidence supporting the usefulness of melatonin for
the treatment of insomnia,a,6 valerian root has sedativehypnotic properties, possibly due to a mechanism involving inhibition of  xxxg8xxx , the enzyme
that breaks down and inactivates gaba. 12 as with
melatonin, valerian root preparations are not regulated by the fda. a
agents under development include the non- xxxd1459xxx 
gabaa receptor agonists gaboxadol and indiplon.4,7
other therapeutic targets for future development are
gabab, o2 8, serotonin (5-ht2a), h 1 antihistamine,
and h a antihistamine receptors, la
mechanism o f action
three subtypes of mammalian melatonin receptors
have been identified and are classified as mt 1, mt2,
and mta. 4,6,7 however, only the mt 1 and mt 2 subtypes are known to play a role in the regulation of
sleep. activation of these receptors leads to an inhibition of adenylate cyclase and a resultant decrease in

cyclic  xxxd81xxx  (camp) production. 4'7  xxxd3078xxx  works by selectively binding and
exerting agonist activity at mt 1 and mt 2 receptors in
the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn), a small area of the
hypothalamus,s,23 the scn acts as the internal clock
of the body and is responsible for the generation of
the circadian rhythm, which plays an integral role in
the sleep-wake cycle.784 activation of the mt 1 receptor is believed to regulate sleepiness and facilitate
sleep onset, while the mt 2 receptor may mediate
phase-shifting effects of melatonin on the circadian
rhythm.4,7~-s
studies of receptor binding have revealed that
 xxxd3078xxx  is a highly selective agonist at mt 1 and
mt 2 receptors, with little affinity for the mt 3 receptor. 9,26-29 in an animal study using chick forebrain,
 xxxd3078xxx  exhibited a 15-fold greater affinity for
the mt 1 receptor than melatonin.26 in contrast,
 xxxd3078xxx  had a 100-fold lower affinity for hamster
brain mt 2 receptors than melatonin.26,a° when using
chinese hamster ovary cells that express human mt 1
receptors,  xxxd3078xxx  inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
camp production with a 4-fold higher potency than
endogenous melatonin.2~,a° compared with melatonin,  xxxd3078xxx  has a selectivity for mt 1 receptors
>1000-fold over that of mt 2 receptors.27 increased
affinity and selectivity for mt 1 receptors suggests that
 xxxd3078xxx  may target sleep onset more specifically
than melatonin and may be a more suitable medication for insomnia characterized by difficulty falling
asleep.7
 xxxd3078xxx  has no appreciable affinity for  xxxd1459xxx ,
dopamine, opiate, or  xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx  sites.2s in
addition, it has not been found to have affinity for
receptors that bind acetylcholine, norepinephrine,
neuropeptides, or cytokines,s the active metabolite
of  xxxd3078xxx , m-ii, has no significant affinity for any
other receptors, except for a weak affinity for the
serotonin  xxxg1114xxx  (median inhibitory concentration, 1.75 mm). 2s,29 the weak affinity of
m-h for the  xxxg1114xxx  is unlikely of clinical
importance due to the low serum concentration of
the parent compound necessary for the activation of
mt 1 receptors.2s
pharmacokinetic properties
following oral administration,  xxxd3078xxx  is rapidly absorbed, with a tm~ of <1 hours,al-3s; however,
the absolute bioavailability is low (<2%) due to exten-

i

sive first-pass hepatic metabolism. pharmacokinetic
parameters of  xxxd3078xxx  are summarized in table lii.
in a study in 6 healthy male volunteers, a single
16-mg oral dose of (14c)- xxxd3078xxx  was rapidly absorbed, with a tmax of 0.3 hour and an elimination tla
of 1.2 hours.s1,32 of the total radioactivity administered, 84% was recovered in the urine and 4% was
eliminated in the feces,31,32with metabolites of  xxxd3078xxx  accounting for the majority of radioactivity recovered. the rate of recovery of urinary radioactivity
suggested at least 84% absorption of  xxxd3078xxx  following oral administration.31,32 serum concentrations
of  xxxd3078xxx  were low compared with those of its
metabolites (actual values not reported), and urinary
excretion of the parent compound was negligible
(<0.1%). 31,32 based on those results, it may be concluded that  xxxd3078xxx  undergoes extensive first-pass
metabolism.
in a crossover study to determine the absolute
bioavailability of oral  xxxd3078xxx , 18 healthy male subjects received a single 16-mg oral dose of  xxxd3078xxx  and
a 5-minute, 2-mg iv infusion in random order. 3¢3ythe
2 treatments were separated by a washout period of
at least 1 week. serum samples were collected over
24 hours following  xxxd3078xxx  administration, and the

absolute bioavailability of  xxxd3078xxx  was calculated
based on the geometric ratio of auc0~ between the
tablet and iv formulations. the absolute bioavailability of the oral formulation was <2% (range, 0.5%12%).3~ 7 based on this finding and the results of the
previous study, it may again be concluded that  xxxd3078xxx  undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.3¢37
karim et al 3s conducted a dose-ascending study in
60 subjects aged 35 to 65 years to further characterize
the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd3078xxx . healthy
adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of  xxxd3078xxx  4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 mg, or
placebo, following a 10-hour fast. blood samples for
pharmacokinetic analyses were collected for 24 hours
after  xxxd3078xxx  administration. the group randomized to the lowest dose of  xxxd3078xxx  was treated first,
and subsequent groups were treated in an ascending
fashion. eight subjects were randomized to each of the
5 dose groups of  xxxd3078xxx , and 20 subjects were randomized to placebo. auc and cm~,,for  xxxd3078xxx  exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetic properties.
mean auc0_oovalues were 1.71, 6.95, 9.88, 22.5, and
36.1 ng • h/ml for the 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-mg
doses of  xxxd3078xxx , respectively, and cm~, values were

tmax values for all doses remained <1 hour (range,

0.75-0.94 hour). the mean elimination tlrz values
were short and dose dependent, ranging from
0.83 hour with the 4-mg dose to 1.90 hours with
the 64-mg dose.
karim et a139 also examined the effects of food on
the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3078xxx . in a
crossover study, 24 healthy subjects were randomized
to receive a single 16-mg oral dose of  xxxd3078xxx  30 minutes following breakfast or following an overnight
fast. the 2 treatment periods were separated by a 5-day
washout period, and pharmacokinetic samples were
collected for 24 hours after each treatment. when
 xxxd3078xxx  was administered following a high-fat
breakfast, the auc0_~ of  xxxd3078xxx  increased by
31%. in addition, the cm~ decreased by 22% and the
mean tmax was delayed by 55 minutes (p < 0.001 for
tmax).8,39 because tmax is substantially delayed following a high-fat meal,  xxxd3078xxx  should not be used
in conjunction with or immediately following a highfat meal s
 xxxd3078xxx  is -82% protein bound, with the majority being bound to albumin,s after iv administration,  xxxd3078xxx  has a mean volume of distribution of
73.6 l, indicating significant tissue distribution,s
 xxxd3078xxx  is hepatically metabolized primarily
via oxidation to hydroxyl and carbonyl groups.s,32
secondary metabolism of  xxxd3078xxx  produces glucuronide conjugates.s,32 the major hepatic isozyme
responsible for metabolism of  xxxd3078xxx  is cytochrome 1)450 (cyp) 1a2.  xxxg576xxx  has implications for drug interactions and will be discussed in
detail later in the text. in addition, the cyp3a4
isozymes and  xxxg584xxx   xxxg585xxx   xxxg587xxx  subfamily are involved to a
lesser extent, s
 xxxd3078xxx  has 4 principal metabolites: m-i, mqi,
m-ill, and m-iv. m-ii is the only active metabolite
and is the most prevalent of the 4 metabolites. after
oral administration, m-ii concentrations are much
higher than  xxxd3078xxx , resulting in a systemic exposure that is 20- to 100-fold greater than the parent

greenblatt et al4°,41 evaluated the effects of age and
sex on the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3078xxx .
a total of 48 healthy subjects (12 men and 12 women
aged 18-34 years, and 12 men and 12 women aged
63-79 years) received a single 1g-rag oral dose of
 xxxd3078xxx  following a light breakfast. 4°,41 pharmacokinetic blood sampling to measure plasma concentrations of  xxxd3078xxx  and m-ii was performed over
the next 24 hours. compared with that in young men,
 xxxd3078xxx  had a similar mean auc in elderly men
(17.0 vs 7.7 n g . h/ml) and a similar elimination tlr2
(1.6 vs 1.2 hours).4° elderly women had a similar
auc (19.8 vs 12.9 ng. h/ml) but a prolonged elimination tlr2 (2.2 vs 1.3 hours; p < 0.05). on evaluation
of rameheon in all of the elderly subjects compared
with younger adults, the auc, cm~, and elimination
tl/2 of  xxxd3078xxx  were significantly greater in the elderly (auc, 18.7 [19.4] vs 10.5 [12.8] ng. h/ml [p =
0.011]; cm~x, 11.6 [13.8] vs 6.9 [7.6] ng/ml [p =
0.024]; tl/2, 2.60 [1.14] vs 1.57 [0.778] hours [p =
0.004]). 41 overall, the total systemic exposure
(auc0_oo)in elderly subjects was 97% higher and the
cmax was 86% greater compared with those in the
younger subjects,s results were similar for the active
metabolite m-ii, revealing elevated auc, cmax, and
tl/2 values in elderly patients (auc, 482.6 [143.5] vs
375.9 [132.9] ng • h/ml [p = 0.009]; cm~x, 124.9
[32.0] vs 110.2 [29.7] ng/ml [ns]; tl/2, 3.21 [0.67] vs
2.42 [0.57] hours [p < 0.001]). 41 the dose used in the
trial was greater than the 8-mg recommended dose,
and although mean systemic exposure and cm~, were
increased in the elderly, the incidences of adverse
events were similar between the elderly and young
groups.4°,41 while no dosage adjustments are recommended for the geriatric population, the prudent practitioner should monitor these patients closely for the
development of adverse effects,s

hepatic impairment
karim et a142 also investigated the effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetic properties of
single and multiple doses of  xxxd3078xxx . a total of 48 patients with varying levels of hepatic impairment were
divided into groups based on child-pugh score. all
patients received a single 16-rag oral dose of  xxxd3078xxx , and pharmacokinetic samples were collected for
48 hours following  xxxd3078xxx  administration. after a

.

2-day washout period, the patients received  xxxd3078xxx 
16 mg/d for 5 days, again followed by sampling for
48 hours. for single doses of  xxxd3078xxx , auc and
cm~, were found to be elevated in patients with mild
and moderate hepatic impairment (mild, auc, 6.99 vs
24.2 ng. h/ml and cm~, 4.4 vs21.1 ng/ml; moderate, auc, 13.6 vs 109 ng • h/ml and cm~, 10.7 vs
60.9 ng/ml). similar data were observed for multiple
doses of  xxxd3078xxx , with the systemic exposure of
 xxxd3078xxx  increased by as much as 10-fold; however,
the increase in  xxxd3078xxx  systemic exposure did not
correlate well with the degree of hepatic dysfunction.
because of the wide therapeutic window of  xxxd3078xxx ,
no dosage adjustments are recommended in patients
with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction, although
caution should be used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment,s,42 a review of the literature did not
identify any published data on the use of  xxxd3078xxx  in
patients with severe hepatic impairment;  xxxd3078xxx 
use should be avoided in these patients, s
renal impairment
in a similar study, tolbert et a143 investigated the
effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetic
properties of single and multiple doses of  xxxd3078xxx .
fifty patients were divided into groups based on the
degree of renal dysfunction (healthy = creatinine clearance [crc1] >80 ml/min, mild = crci 50-80 ml/min,
moderate = crci 30-<50 ml/min, severe = crc1
<30 ml/min, hemodialysis). as in the previous study,
all patients received a single 16-mg oral dose of  xxxd3078xxx  followed by a 2-day washout period. patients
then received  xxxd3078xxx  16 mg/d for 5 days. in each
case, pharmacokinetic samples were collected for
48 hours after the end of the dosing period. overall,
no significant changes were observed in auc or cm~
for the renally impaired patients compared with those in
the healthy subjects. no correlation was noted between
the degree of renal dysfunction and systemic  xxxd3078xxx 
exposure following single or multiple doses of  xxxd3078xxx . based on these data, no dosage adjustments are
necessary for patients with renal impairment or patients
who require hemodialysis,s,43

efficacy and tolerability
several clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and
tolerability of rameheon compared with placebo in the
treatment of transient and primary insomnia.~'~"~.s a
summary of the trials is provided in table iv. to date,

there have been no published trials comparing
 xxxd3078xxx  with other therapeutic agents for the management of insomnia.
roth et a144 evaluated the efficacy of  xxxd3078xxx  in
the treatment of transient insomnia in 375 healthy volunteers aged 35 to 60 years. to simulate a model of
transient insomnia associated with sleep in an unfamiliar environment, the investigators conducted a 1-night
study in a sleep laboratory. eligibility criteria included
a usual sleep duration of 6.5 to 8.5 hours, ability to
fall asleep within 30 minutes, and a habitual bedtime
between 8:30 pm and midnight. participants also had
to be in good overall health and weigh within 20% of
ideal body weight. women were excluded if they were
pregnant or nursing. subjects were also excluded if
they had previously slept in a sleep laboratory, had
an epworth sleepiness scale49 score >10 (scale for
daytime sleepiness; >10 is considered sleepy), had an
altered sleeping schedule within 3 months, had flown
across 3 or more time zones within the past 7 days, or
had any signs or symptoms related to a primary sleep
disorder.
volunteers were stratified into 2 treatment groups
based on reported sleep duration and were randomized to receive a single oral dose of  xxxd3078xxx  16 mg
(n = 126) or 64 mg (n = 126) or placebo (n = 123). all
previous medications (actual medications were not reported) were discontinued 5 half-lives before administration of study medication, and the study drug was
administered 30 minutes before scheduled bedtime.
primary outcome measures included polysomnograplay (psg) recordings to determine the mean lps.
secondary measures included tst, wake time after
sleep onset (waso), percentage of sleep time per sleep
stage, and the number of nighttime awakenings. all
study patients completed a postsleep questionnaire to
assess subjective sleep latency, subjective tst, number
of awakenings, and sleep quality. a digit symbol substitution test (dsst) was used to assess residual drug
effects. statistical analysis consisted of 2-way analysis
of variance, followed by pairwise comparisons to
evaluate active treatment arms versus placebo. the effects of  xxxd3078xxx  16- and 64-mg doses were not direcdy compared.
all subjects completed the study. in both  xxxd3078xxx 
treatment groups, mean lps was significantly decreased compared with placebo (p < 0.001), with
mean lps values of 14.1, 15.5, and 24.6 minutes for
 xxxd3078xxx  16 mg,  xxxd3078xxx  64 mg, and placebo, re-

spectively. mean tst was significantly improved in
the  xxxd3078xxx  arms versus placebo (425.4 and 422.4 vs
411.3 minutes; p = 0.007 and p = 0.033, respectively).
with the exception of subjective sleep latency in the
 xxxd3078xxx  16-mg group, none of the secondary outcomes were significantly different in either  xxxd3078xxx 
group compared with placebo. mean dsst scores were
not significantly different between groups. subjects in
the 64-mg group had significant decreases in level of
alertness (p = 0.020) and ability to concentrate (p =
0.043) on the postsleep questionnaire. the numbers of
reported adverse events were similar between all
groups. headache was the most common (6.7%) adverse event reported in patients receiving either dose
of  xxxd3078xxx . other adverse events included fatigue
(3.2%), somnolence (3.6%), nausea (2.0%), and dizziness (1.6%). although patients treated with  xxxd3078xxx 
had significant improvements in lps and tst in this
simulated model of transient insomnia, the patients did
not have a diagnosis of insomnia, and the differences in
lps and tst were generally 15 minutes or less.
a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated
the use of  xxxd3078xxx  in patients aged 18 to 64 years
with primary insomnia (n = 103). 46 eligible patients
had experienced insomnia for >3 months before the
study and mean lps >20 minutes, and had a mean
wake time >60 minutes on 2 consecutive screening
nights in a sleep laboratory. each patient was randomized to a 5-treatment schedule that included rameheon
4, 8, 16, and 32 mg and placebo. each treatment was
administered 30 minutes before normal bedtime on
2 consecutive nights, with a washout period of 5 to
12 days between treatments. psg monitoring was performed to determine lps, tst, waso, and sleep efficiency (ratio of tst to total time spent in bed). other
measures included a visual analog scale was) for
mood and feeling, dsst, memory-recall test, and
postsleep questionnaire.
reduction in mean lps in all  xxxd3078xxx  groups was
significant compared with that in the placebo group
(all, p < 0.001), with mean lps values of 24.0, 24.3,
24.0, 22.9, and 37.7 minutes in the  xxxd3078xxx  4-, 8-,
16-, and 32-mg groups and the placebo group, respectively. additionally, significant increases in tst were
observed with all doses of  xxxd3078xxx  (all, p = 0.001
for overall effect) compared with placebo. although
the increase in tst was found to be statistically significant, the mean tst increased by 11 to 18 minutes in
all groups treated with  xxxd3078xxx  compared with pla-

cebo. patients who received  xxxd3078xxx  spent a lower
mean percentage of time in the non-rapid eye movement stage compared with those receiving placebo.
the 16-mg group reported a subjective decrease in lps
(p < 0.05) compared with placebo. other measures,
such as the vas, dsst, memory-recall tests, and subjective levels of alertness and ability to concentrate,
were not statistically or clinically significant. patients
reported headache (5.3%), somnolence (1.9%), and
pharyngolaryngeal pain (1.9%) as the most common
adverse events; however, no differences in adverse
events were found among the active-treatment groups
and compared with placebo.
zammit et a147 conducted a 35-night double-blind
study to evaluate the efficacy of  xxxd3078xxx  in patients
with primary insomnia as defined in the diagnostic and
statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition, text revision. 2 a total of 405 patients (mean age,
39.3 years) were randomized to receive  xxxd3078xxx  8 or
16 mg or placebo each night. patients were evaluated
in the sleep laboratory on nights 1-2, 15-16, and
29-30. on days 36-37, patients were given placebo
and evaluated in the sleep laboratory for the assessment of possible withdrawal effects and rebound insomnia. psg was used to determine lps, tst, and
sleep efficiency. patients also completed a postsleep
questionnaire. nights not spent in the laboratory were
evaluated using a sleep diary. mean lps values for
 xxxd3078xxx  8 and 16 mg were significandy reduced
compared with placebo on nights 1-2 (32.2 and
28.9 vs 47.9 minutes; p < 0.001), nights 15-16 (32.6
and 27.9 vs 45.5 minutes; p < 0.001), and nights
29-30 (31.5 and 29.5 vs 42.5 minutes; p = 0.003).
patients treated with  xxxd3078xxx  8 and 16 mg had significant improvements in tst and sleep efficiency on
nights 1-2 (tst, 394.2 and 397.6 vs 375.2 minutes
[p < 0.001]; sleep efficiency, 82.3% and 83.4% vs
78.3% [p < 0.001]). differences in tst and sleep efficiency were not noted on the other nights of sleep
laboratory observation. rebound insomnia and withdrawal effects were not observed. adverse-event rates
were not provided but were reported to be similar between all groups.
seiden et al4s conducted a double-blind, placebocontrolled study of  xxxd3078xxx  use in elderly patients
with primary insomnia. the study enrolled 829 patients (aged 63-94 years, mean age, 72.4 years), of
whom 693 patients completed the trial. patients were
randomized to rameheon 4 mg, 8 mg, or placebo be-

fore bedtime for 5 weeks. prior to starting treatment
with the study medication, patients completed an initial 7-night placebo lead-in period. after 5 weeks of assigned treatment, the study concluded with a 7-night
placebo run-out period to assess rebound insomnia or
withdrawal effects. patients completed a sleep diary
and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptom questionnaire, so the primary end point was patient-reported
sleep latency within the first week. in the first week of
treatment, mean subjective sleep latency was significandy reduced in patients who received  xxxd3078xxx  4
and 8 mg compared with that in those who received
placebo (4 vs 8 mg, 70.2 vs 78.5 minutes; p = 0.008).
although treatment with  xxxd3078xxx  was associated
with statistically significant reductions in subjective
sleep latency, the mean difference in sleep latency
compared with placebo was 8 minutes, and subjective
time to sleep onset was 70 minutes. the investigators
did not provide individual data for the 4- and 8-mg
groups at later time points but reported significant effects on sleep latency at weeks 3 (p = 0.013) and 5
(p < 0.001) for the 4- and 8-mg groups combined.
mean tst was increased in the 4-mg  xxxd3078xxx  group
compared with placebo (4 rag, 313.9 vs 324.6 minutes [p = 0.004]; 8 mg, 313.9 vs 321.1 minutes [p =
ns]), although much of the change in tst was probably attributable to the decrease in mean sleep latency. rebound insomnia after discontinuation of  xxxd3078xxx  was not reported, and no withdrawal effects
were observed. adverse event rates were not provided
but were reported to be similar between all treatment
groups.
in a randomized, double-blind, 3-way crossover
study, roth et al4s evaluated the use of  xxxd3078xxx  in
100 elderly patients with primary insomnia. patients included in the trial were between 65 and 83 years of age
(mean, 70.7 years) and had a diagnosis of primary
insomnia for at least 3 months, a bedtime between
8:30 pm and midnight, and a mean sleep latency
>_20 minutes on 2 consecutive nights. patients were randomized to receive  xxxd3078xxx  4 or 8 nag or placebo,
given 30 minutes before bedtime on 2 consecutive
nights. treatments were separated by a 5- to 12-day
washout period. the primary outcome was the least
squares mean sleep latency of 2-night psg recordings.
secondary outcomes included next-day effects on psychomotor and memory skills, and patient level of alertness and ability to concentrate. the dsst, memoryrecall tests, and postsleep questionnaires were used to

analyze these measures. compared with placebo, significant reductions in mean sleep latency were seen in both
the 4- and 8-mg  xxxd3078xxx  groups (p < 0.001 and p <
0.010, respectively). tst and sleep efficiency also were
significantly improved in these groups (tst: 4 mg, p =
0.036; 8 mg, p = 0.007; sleep efficiency: 4 mg, p < 0.05;
8 mg, p < 0.01). during the treatment period, residual effects of  xxxd3078xxx  were not observed. nausea (3.5%)
and headache (3.5%) were the most commonly reported
adverse events in both the 4- and 8-mg treatment groups.

dosage and administration
although doses used in clinical trials ranged from
4 to 64 mg,  xxxd3078xxx  is available only as an 8-mg
tablet, s the recommended dosage is 8 mg administered orally within 30 minutes of bedtime.  xxxd3078xxx 
should not be used in conjunction with or immediately following a high-fat meal. patients with mild or
moderate hepatic impairment may use  xxxd3078xxx  with
caution, but those with severe impairment should not
use  xxxd3078xxx . no dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with renal impairment, including
patients with severe renal impairment or those who
require hemodialysis.  xxxd3078xxx  is classified as pregnancy category c and should be used in pregnancy
only if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks to the
fetus, s no published data are available regarding the
use of  xxxd3078xxx  in pediatric patients or patients with
severe sleep apnea or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd); therefore, no dosage recommendations exist for these populations.
adverse events
 xxxd3078xxx  has been found to be generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with most adverse events classified
as mild or moderate. 6,s,as,37,4°,41,44,46 adverse events
most commonly seen with  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg included
headache (7%), somnolence (5%), dizziness (5%), fatigue (4%), and nausea (3%). in clinical studies with
 xxxd3078xxx , 5% of patients discontinued treatment due
to adverse effects. patients were most likely to discontinue treatment due to headache, somnolence, fatigue, or
dizziness,s following the administration of  xxxd3078xxx ,
patients did not report rebound insomnia or withdrawal effects.44,4~,49 compared with placebo, patients receiving  xxxd3078xxx  did not exhibit any evidence of
cognitive impairment as observed in several clinical trials using tools such as the dsst, memory tasks, and
vas.3s,44,46in patients with mild to moderate copd or

those with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea, no
significant respiratory depressant effects or exacerbations
of sleep apnea were seen with  xxxd3078xxx  treatment, sl-s2
two studies were conducted to evaluate the effects
of  xxxd3078xxx  on endocrine function,s,s3 in the first
study, 99 healthy volunteers were randomized to receive  xxxd3078xxx  16 mg or placebo for 28 nights,s3
blood samples were drawn at baseline and days 14,
29, and 42 to analyze levels of adrenocorticotropic
hormone, cortisol, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, testosterone,
 xxxd3368xxx , thyroxine, and triiodothyronine. the investigators found no significant
differences between  xxxd3078xxx  and placebo in any of
the hormone levels measured. the major limitation of
that study was the short duration.
in the second endocrine function study, 122 patients
with chronic insomnia were randomized to receive
 xxxd3078xxx  16 mg or placebo for 6 months, s the effects
of  xxxd3078xxx  on the thyroid, adrenal, and reproductive
axes were evaluated. increases in serum prolactin levels
occurred in 32% of patients who received  xxxd3078xxx 
compared with 19% of patients who received placebo.
the mean change from baseline in prolactin level was
significantly greater in women in the  xxxd3078xxx  group
compared with that in women in the placebo group
(p = 0.003). the mechanism for increased prolactin is
not understood at this time. also, both endocrine function studies used  xxxd3078xxx  16 mg, which is greater
than the recommended dose.
abuse potential
the abuse potential and effects on behavior of
 xxxd3078xxx  were compared with those of triazolam in a
double-blind, crossover study by griffiths et al.s4 that
study was the only available publication we found that
compared the abuse potential of  xxxd3078xxx  with those
of another agent; however, efficacy was not evaluated.
fourteen adult patients with known histories of sedative
drug abuse received single oral doses of  xxxd3078xxx  16,
80, and 160 mg; triazolam 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 mg; and
placebo. the method of study drug assignment (ie, randomization) was not stated. each of the 7 treatments
was separated by a washout period. a subjective questionnaire was used to measure abuse potential.
behavioral and cognitive performance was measured
using a word recall/recognition task, enter and recall
task, balance task, dsst, and circular lights performance. compared with placebo, patients treated with

doses of  xxxd3078xxx  up to 20-fold the recommended dose
had no differences on questionnaire items such as "drug
liking, .... good effects,.... drug strength," and "street
value." in addition,  xxxd3078xxx  was found to have no significant effect on behavioral and cognitive performance.
consistent with the known potential for abuse, triazolam 0.50 and 0.75 mg were associated with increased
"drug liking" on questionnaires and impaired task performance on behavioral assessments.

drug-drug interactions
because cyp1a2 is the major isozyme responsible
for hepatic metabolism of  xxxd3078xxx , medications that
induce or inhibit the activity of the isozyme may cause
significant alterations in  xxxd3078xxx  metabolism and
systemic exposure. the isozymes  xxxg584xxx   xxxg585xxx   xxxg587xxx  and cyp3a4
affect the metabolism of  xxxd3078xxx  to a minor degree.
some medications that are strong cyp1a2 inhibitors indude amiodarone, ciprofloxacin, and fluvoxamine,ss
to determine the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction between fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor, and  xxxd3078xxx , subjects were administered fluvoxamine 100 mg bid for 3 days prior
to receiving a single dose of  xxxd3078xxx  16 rag.s the
concurrent use of these medications resulted in a 190fold increase in the auc of  xxxd3078xxx , as well as a 70fold increase in cm~,,. therefore,  xxxd3078xxx  should not
be used in patients receiving fluvoxamine,s studies
have not adequately addressed the potential drugdrug interactions with the combination of  xxxd3078xxx  and other cyp1a2 inhibitors, but  xxxd3078xxx 
should be used with caution and close monitoring in
patients receiving these agents,s other medications reported to increase levels of  xxxd3078xxx  in clinical trials,
such as fluoxetine (cyp2d6 inhibitor) and ketoconazole (cyp3a4 inhibitor), did not cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions, although they increased exposure to  xxxd3078xxx  and the metabolite
m-ii, suggesting a need for close monitoring in these
patients, as well.s,st,s7 in contrast, rifampin, a strong
inducer of the cyp enzyme system, significantly decreased total exposure to  xxxd3078xxx  and m-ii following administration of rifampin 600 mg/d for 11 days.
thus, the efficacy of  xxxd3078xxx  may be compromised
in the presence of rifampin. drugs with a narrow therapeutic index were also assessed in clinical trials to
evaluate the potential for interactions. digoxin (pglycoprotein substrate), warfarin (cyp2c9 [s]/ xxxg576xxx 
[r] substrate), and theophylline ( xxxg576xxx  substrate)

had no clinically significant effect on  xxxd3078xxx  or vice

pharmacoeconomic considerations

our literature search found no published studies
that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of rameheon in
the treatment of insomnia. the average wholesale
price of a 30-day supply of  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg administered daily was $81.00.19 in comparison, the cost of a
30-day supply of the conventional recommended
adult doses of the non-bzds zolpidem, zaleplon, and
 xxxd2047xxx  were $101.84, $102.82, and $121.14, respectively.19 the cost of rameheon was less than that
of the non-bzds; however, because it is the first drug
in its class and no pharmacoeconomic studies are
available, the cost-effectiveness of  xxxd3078xxx  in the
treatment of insomnia remains to be determined.
conclusions

 xxxd3078xxx , the first fda-approved melatonin receptor agonist, represents a pharmacologic option for the
treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty
falling asleep. in clinical studies of patients with primary insomnia, treatment with  xxxd3078xxx  was associated with small but statistically significant decreases in
sleep latency at doses ranging from 4 to 32 mg. effects
on tst and sleep efficiency were less pronounced and
were not consistently observed in all clinical studies. in
general,  xxxd3078xxx  was well tolerated, with the main
adverse effects consisting of headache, somnolence,
dizziness, fatigue, and nausea. no evidence of cognitive impairment, rebound insomnia, withdrawal effects, or abuse potential have been noted. elevated
prolactin levels were associated with administration of
rameheon in 1 trial. with a lack of published trials
comparing  xxxd3078xxx  with other sedative-hypnotic
agents, it is not yet possible to determine its efficacy
relative to other therapeutic options for insomnia.
