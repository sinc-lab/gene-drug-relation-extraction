binding of oral contraceptive progestogens to serum proteins and cytoplasmic receptor.  some progesterones widely used in oral contraceptives are characterized at the level of high-affinity receptor binding as well as binding to  xxxg2066xxx  and corticosteroid-binding globulin. with regard to binding to  xxxg2066xxx , gestodene, levonorgestrel, and to a lesser extent  xxxd2067xxx  (which is only formed from the prodrug  xxxd1849xxx  in the body), show a behavior that is manifested in the relatively high affinity to  xxxg2066xxx , whereas  xxxd1849xxx  and  xxxd2753xxx  do not display any measurable affinity for this specific steroid-binding serum protein. furthermore, levonorgestrel and gestodene dissociate very much more slowly from the binding sites of  xxxg2066xxx  than  xxxd2067xxx . a natural affinity of all these synthetic progestogens tested for corticosteroid-binding globulin could not be established. gestodene, levonorgestrel, and  xxxd2067xxx  bind to the progesterone, glucocorticoid, and  xxxg183xxx  with high affinity, apart from slight differences, whereas  xxxg730xxx  affinity could not be demonstrated in any of the progestogens investigated. in relation to aldosterone, the relative binding affinity values of gestodene, levonorgestrel, and the natural progestogen progesterone are relatively high, whereas  xxxd2067xxx  does not display any measurable affinity for this receptor species.
