abstract
norepinephrine transporter (net) mediates the active removal of norepinephrine (ne) released from sympathetic nerve terminals via
reuptake, and net function and expression can be regulated by cocaine. net expression and its regulation by cocaine in the developing
sympathetic nervous system during early postnatal period, however, have not been examined. we quantified immunodetectable net protein
expression in the neonatal rat heart to examine the developmental pattern of myocardial net during the first 2 weeks after birth. to assess
sympathetic innervations, we simultaneously quantified the expression of myocardial  xxxg2276xxx  (th).
timed pregnant rats received daily intragastric treatment with saline (ctl) or cocaine at 60 mg/kg (coc) from gestational day 2 until
parturition. after birth, nursing mothers continued to receive the same treatment. the expression of myocardial th and net in neonatal rats
were then studied at 1 day (postnatal day 1,  xxxg1688xxx ), 7 days (pd7) or 14 days (pd14) of age. we observed a similar age-dependent increase in
the expression for myocardial net and th during the first 2 weeks of postnatal life, in both ctl and coc animals. while myocardial th
was significantly up-regulated following perinatal cocaine exposure, no significant change in immunodetectable myocardial net protein was
evident. to further examine whether net function might be affected by perinatal cocaine exposure, we performed ne uptake in myocardial
membranes from pd14 ctl and coc rats. we found that ne uptake was reduced at pd14 in the cocaine-treated group. our results indicate
that myocardial net and th are both developmentally regulated. furthermore, our results indicate that perinatal exposure to cocaine did not
change net protein expression but impaired myocardial net function in the neonatal rat.

1. introduction
norepinephrine transporter (net) proteins are mainly
expressed at noradrenergic nerve terminals in the central
nervous system and are located in the postganglionic
sympathetic presynaptic nerve terminals in the periphery.
in a variety of pathophysiological conditions, nets are
considered to be a clinically important protein. numerous
clinical conditions have been reported to be associated with
deficiency or mutation in the net gene [7,38,47]. among
these include the orthostatic intolerance syndrome, autonomic disorder and alzheimer’s disease, liver failure,
chronic heart failure, diabetes, etc. [16,20,30,42,52]. in

nets are down-regulated and norepinephrine (ne) uptake
was reduced. loss of net or decreased ne clearance has
been associated with depression, severe heart and major
vascular diseases.
nets belong to a superfamily of 12-transmembrane
domain, na + -dependent  xxxg2099xxx  proteins
that include dopamine transporters (dat) and serotonin
transporters (sert). nets are found at noradrenergic nerve
terminals [1,17,33,57] where they mediate the active reuptake of as much as 90% of neurally released ne. consequently, they are the major determinants of the actual ne
available for binding of the neurotransmitter to postsynaptic
adrenoceptors in the adult sympathetic nervous system [57].
nets thus play an important role in the regulation of cardiac
function. during the early postnatal period, both the synthetic machinery for ne in the heart and myocardial ne
stores increase as sympathetic innervations become fully
established. the functional reuptake of released ne into
sympathetic nerve terminals appeared to be much less in the

444

y. zhao, l. sun / neurotoxicology and teratology 26 (2004) 443–450

immature cardiovascular system compared to that in the
adult [5,11,12,24,26,31]. while the endogenous myocardial
ne store has been shown to correlate with ne uptake in
neonatal hearts [24,26,28], and thus a developmental increase in ne uptake sites has been inferred, the precise
developmental pattern of net in the heart has not been
defined.
nets are also the target of many commonly used drugs
including antidepressant agents, anesthetics and psychostimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamine [15,34,35,37,39 –
41,51,58 –60]. cocaine has a very high affinity for net
[1,58], and has been shown to acutely regulate the function
and expression of net, in vitro, via a number of different
signaling pathways [8,15,44,59]. chronic cocaine treatment,
in vivo, induced an increase in net binding capacity in the
adult brain [9,14]. the effect of chronic cocaine treatment on
net in the developing heart, however, is unknown. in the
present study, we will document the pattern of net expression during postnatal development in the neonatal rat heart.
we will use  xxxg2276xxx  (th), the rate-limiting
enzyme ne synthesis, as a marker for sympathetic innervations. we will also examine the effect of chronic perinatal
exposure to cocaine on the expression of myocardial net
during the first two postnatal weeks.

2. methods
2.1. materials
except where noted, all chemicals were purchased
from sigma (st. louis, mo). protease inhibitor mixtures
were obtained from roche molecular biochemicals (indianapolis, in). rabbit anti-rat net and anti-th antibodies
were purchased from chemicon international (temecula,
ca) and calbiochem (san diego, ca), respectively.
enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) solutions and donkey
anti-rabbit secondary antibody were obtained from amersham pharmacia biotech (piscataway, nj). [3h]ne was
purchased from new england nuclear (nen, massachusetts). cocaine was obtained from nida. four to 20%
gradient sds precast gels were obtained from novex
(carlsbad, ca).
2.2. animal model
in this study, we performed studies to examine the
changes as a function of age (defined as developmental
studies), and we also examined the effect of perinatal
exposure to cocaine on net expression/function at each
age (defined as cocaine studies). timed pregnant sprague –
dawley rats at gestational day 2 (for cocaine studies) and
gestational day 16 (for developmental studies) were purchased from taconic farms (germantown, ny) and housed
in our animal care facility according to nih guidelines until
parturition. the animals have free access to food and water

in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a 12h light/dark cycle. the mothers were given either normal
saline or cocaine 60 mg daily by intragastric administration
throughout gestation and postpartum period until the time of
study.
2.3. tissue handling
rat pups were killed by decapitation at postnatal days
(pds) 1, 7 and 14, and myocardial tissues were harvested for
developmental study. in cocaine studies, hearts and brains
from pups were harvested at pds 1, 7 and 14. tissues were
then rinsed with normal saline, cleaned of gross blood,
blotted dry and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at 70 jc.
2.4. protein preparation
the membrane proteins from myocardial and whole
brain were prepared using a modification of furuta’s
method [22]. briefly, frozen heart and whole brain tissues
were homogenized on ice in buffer containing 20 mm
tris – hcl (ph 7.4), 1 mm edta, 1 mm egta and 10%
sucrose supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 tablet of
protease inhibitor mixture/10 ml homogenization buffer).
the homogenized tissues were centrifuged at 1000  g for
10 min at 4 jc. an aliquot of supernatants was collected
for th immunoblotting. the remaining supernatants were
further centrifuged at 106,000  g for 45 min at 4 jc. the
pellets were resuspended in the homogenization buffer.
protein concentrations were determined by the bradford
method, using the protocol from the manufacturer. sample
loading buffer was added to each sample and was stored at
4 jc.
2.5. western immunoblotting analysis
forty micrograms of membrane protein from the heart or
brain were size-fractioned on a 4 –20% gradient sds-page
gel and then electrophoretically transferred to a pvdf
membrane. membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk
in pbst and then exposed to a polyclonal antibody against
either net (chemicon international) or th (calbiochem) at
a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. donkey antirabbit secondary antibody was used at a 1:2000 dilution for
1 h at room temperature. antibody binding was detected by
ecl, as recommended by the manufacturer. the pvdf
membranes used for immunoblotting were stripped with an
antibody to a actin to quantify the loading of protein. the
signal intensity was quantified using densitometry after xray film development.
2.6. [3h]ne uptake assay
fresh rat ventricular tissue slices from 14-day-old
control and coc rats were weighed and quickly transferred

445

to separate tubes. tissues were first incubated for 15 min
with the following solution (ph 7.5, 37 jc) containing (in
mm): nacl, 125; kcl, 5; cacl2, 2.5;  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2;
nahco3, 25; kh2po4, 1; dextrose, 11, iproniazid, 0.01;
edta, 20 mg/l;  xxxd228xxx , 200 mg/l and gassed with
95% o2 and 5% co2. the tissues were then incubated for
an additional 15 min with or without desipramine (10 am)
before incubation with [3h]ne (50 nm) for 30 min.
reaction was then stopped with ice-cold solution. tissues
were then placed in ice-cold tca, followed by counting of
radioactivity by the scintillation counter. uptake of [3h]ne
was expressed as specific activity in pmol ne per milligram of tissue.
2.7. data analysis and statistics
for immunoblotting experiments, signal intensities from
different age groups were normalized to the adult group. to
determine whether there was an age-dependent change,
data were first analyzed by anova. if anova was found
to be significant, bonferroni’s modified t test was employed as a post hoc test. to determine the effect of
cocaine, data were analyzed comparing cocaine-treated
group with controls at each age by student’s t test.
p < 0.05 was deemed significant. data were expressed as
mean f s.e.m.

3. results
3.1. myocardial th protein expression during postnatal
development
in the neonatal rat heart, the sympathetic innervation
continues developing after birth and becomes essentially
fully established by the end of 2 weeks. we used the
relative abundance of immunodetectable myocardial th to
assess sympathetic innervation in the neonatal heart during
the first two postnatal weeks. myocardial th protein in
the rat increased from 506 f 89.1 (arbitrary units) on  xxxg1688xxx 
to 945 f 179 on pd7 and to 1033 f 148.8 on pd14
( p < .05; fig. 1a), consistent with the continued development of cardiac sympathetic innervation. the levels at
pd7 and pd14 were comparable to levels in adult hearts
(905 f 149; p>.05). a representative western blot from
immunoblotting experiment for the expression of th is
shown in fig. 1b.
3.2. myocardial net protein expression during postnatal
development
net proteins are usually localized at adrenergic nerve
endings in the cns or in peripheral sympathetic nerve
terminals. we evaluated the relative abundance of myocardial net by immunoblotting. myocardial net protein
increased with age, a pattern that was similar to the

from  xxxg1688xxx  (870.8 f 156.9, arbitrary units) to pd7 (1380 f
191; p < .05), which was similar to pd14 (1412 f 194) and
adult levels (1780 f 186; fig. 2a). a representative western blot from an immunoblotting experiment for net
expression is shown in fig. 2b.
3.3. chronic perinatal cocaine exposure increased whole
brain and myocardial th protein expression
previously, other investigators have shown that perinatal cocaine exposure induced an up-regulation in whole
brain th protein expression and activity [19,29,55,56]. in
our model of perinatal cocaine exposure, we confirmed
that whole brain th protein expression was increased
(fig. 3).
the effect of perinatal cocaine treatment on myocardial th, however, has not been reported. we found
perinatal cocaine exposure induced an up-regulation in
myocardial th protein expression at pd14 (fig. 4).
moreover, an age-dependent increase in myocardial th
observed in controls was preserved in cocaine-treated
animals (fig. 4).

of age (all n = 8). * p < .05 compared to  xxxg1688xxx  within the same treatment

net

myocardial tissues from rats of different ages is shown. an age-dependent
increase is seen from  xxxg1688xxx  to pd7 and pd14. adult band intensity is similar
to that from pd14. top bands are net and bottom bands are a actin
derived from the same gel to quantify protein loading.

fig. 3. immunodetectable th protein prepared from whole brain increased
from  xxxg1688xxx  to pd14 in both rats treated perinatally with saline (control) or
cocaine at 60 mg/kg (cocaine). immunodetectable total whole brain th was
significantly greater in cocaine than in controls at age 1 and 14 days (n = 6).
* p < .05 compared to  xxxg1688xxx  within the same treatment group. ^p < .05 to
age-matched controls.

perinatal cocaine exposure did not significantly increase
the immunodetectable myocardial net at any age. in both
controls and cocaine-treated rats, an age-dependent increase
in myocardial net expression was observed during the first
2 weeks of life (fig. 5).
because immunodetectable proteins may include both
functionally active proteins and proteins which might not be

functionally significant, we specifically determined net
function using [3h]ne uptake in fresh myocardial tissue
slices from neonatal rats at pd14. myocardial tissues from
controls and cocaine rats were obtained from animals treated
contemporaneously and uptake assays were performed at
the same time. ne uptake activity was reduced significantly
to 72.4 f 12.1% in animals with perinatal cocaine exposure
compared to controls (n = 10 each; fig. 6).

4. discussion
the current study showed that the expression of net and
th proteins increased during the first two postnatal weeks.
the similarity in the postnatal increase in myocardial net
and th suggests that both th and net are developmentally
regulated. we also demonstrated that perinatal cocaine
exposure induced an up-regulation in myocardial th expression and a reduction in net uptake activity.
because th mediates the rate-limiting step in ne synthesis, it is often used as a marker for cns noradrenergic
innervation and peripheral sympathetic innervation
[2,27,32]. the relative abundance of th at different postnatal stages has been used to assess noradrenergic neural
development during the neonatal period [2,27]. the fact that
there is also a gradual postnatal increase in ne uptake sites
and activity in myocardial tissues [5,11,21,24] would suggest that the protein responsible for ne uptake, i.e., net,
may also serve as a marker for peripheral sympathetic neural
development. indeed, more studies, specifically examining
net, have revealed that the expression of this protein
begins as early as the onset of differentiation of neural crest
stem cells into sympathetic neurons, even before the expression of th was demonstrable [45]. this suggests that
perhaps, net may be an even earlier indicator of adrenergic

447

development. in the present study, our results demonstrated
that there was a pattern of developmental increase in
myocardial net protein expression during the first 2 weeks
of the postnatal life. we also established that both net and
th protein expression followed a similar age-dependent
pattern of increase. these findings illustrate that maturation
of the sympathetic nervous system, as indicated by the
relative abundance of th, correlated with a postnatal
increase in ne uptake activity shown by other investigators
[5,19].
cocaine induced an up-regulation in immunodetectable
cns and myocardial th. that prenatal cocaine exposure
induced an up-regulation in cns th has already been
reported by others. however, it has not been shown that
prenatal cocaine exposure could have comparable effects
in the expression of th, peripherally, i.e., in the sympathetic nervous system. although perinatal cocaine treatment did not change the developmental pattern of th or
net expression in the heart during the first 2 weeks of
postnatal life, it appeared to reduce net function while it
up-regulated th expression. these results suggest that
cocaine may play different roles in the regulation of th
and net in myocardial tissues. opposing changes in
systems mediating catecholamines synthesis and uptake
have been reported in vivo in rat adrenomedullary tissues
following reserpine treatment [18]. reserpine increased th
mrna, but diminished the expression of net mrna.
similarly, differential regulation of rat adrenal th and
net have also been demonstrated following water deprivation [13].
the studies of cocaine effects on net have been
inconsistent because a variety of models have been used
to examine net and many different means have been
used to assess net. most studies have been in vitro
studies, using models of net-transfected cells. studies to
assess changes in net following cocaine included examination of net mrna expression, net protein expression by radioligand binding, or immunodetection and
net function by ne uptake [4,14,23,35]. binding studies
are used to quantify protein using radiolabeled ligands (in
the case of net, it is 3h-nisoxitine). uptake assays are
used to assess net function. several studies performed in
hek-293 cells and in rat brain have shown cocaine to
have no effects on net protein expression [4,10,60]. in
contrast, other studies have clearly detailed changes in
net binding capacity and expression following chronic
cocaine treatment [9,23,41,43,50]. in the present study,
we performed the uptake assay to assess the function of
net after prenatal cocaine exposure and did not perform
binding assays as a part of this study. none of the studies
examining cocaine effects on net has been performed in
the context of development. our study specifically examined the effects of perinatal cocaine exposure on net
expression in the immature myocardium and in the
context of developing myocardial sympathetic innervation.
we demonstrated that gestational and postnatal cocaine

448

y. zhao, l. sun / neurotoxicology and teratology 26 (2004) 443–450

exposure had no effect on net protein expression but it
decreased net uptake activity in myocardial tissue at
pd14. there are several possible mechanisms by which
cocaine could regulate net expression/function in the
immature heart during the perinatal period. cocaine
treatment has been shown to alter inhibitory g-protein
expression in the brain and in the heart [48,54], and could
therefore modulate g-protein-coupled receptor signaling
pathways to regulate net expression. one important
signaling pathway that has been shown to regulate net
function and expression is protein kinase c (pkc), a
pathway that is activated by g-protein-coupled receptors.
activation of pkc with phorbol esters can lead to a
down-regulation in net expression and a reduction in the
bmax of 3h-nisoxetine binding. this is mediated by pkcinduced net phosphorylation, which causes sequestration
of net proteins from the cell surface membrane
[3,12,46]. chronic cocaine exposure has been reported
to modify pkc activity [54]. in the current study, we
found that perinatal cocaine exposure induced a decrease
in the uptake function of myocardial net without any
changes in net protein expression. chronic perinatal
cocaine exposure may decrease net function via pkcmediated translocation of surface net to intracellular
locations. however, one of the limitations of our study
is that the protein membrane preparations used in our
experiments did not permit the examination of changes in
subcellular localization of net. future studies using
surface-specific ligands, such as biotinylated probes or
immunohistochemical techniques, will be needed to address this question. regulation of net has also been
reported to occur through activation of the receptor
 xxxg2198xxx  and ras/mapk signaling pathway by
growth factors [36].  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf) has been
shown to regulate net expression in vivo and in vitro
[25,45], and cocaine-mediated down-regulation of net
expression in pc12 cell line has been shown to be related
to its modulatory effects in ngf signaling. elucidation of
the signaling pathways that mediate the down-regulation
of net function with perinatal cocaine exposure will be
the subject of future studies.
in conclusion, our study showed that net proteins were
developmentally regulated and were also regulated by
perinatal exposure to cocaine. if our results can be extrapolated to the human infant, they would suggest that very
young children who have immature cardiovascular sympathetic innervations are extremely vulnerable to the effect of
cocaine both at the level of ne synthesis and ne reuptake.
they might be expected to have inefficient reuptake capacity for ne even in the face of increased ne synthesis. this
may lead to extremely high tissue and plasma catecholamine
levels at rest and in response to stress [49,53]. one might
anticipate that the responses to many drugs that interact with
myocardial net could be different in infants born to
mothers with history of cocaine abuse. neonates and infants
undergoing surgery are anesthetized with intravenous and

inhaled anesthetic agents that modulate net uptake activity.
one might speculate that infants of cocaine-abusing mothers
may be at risk to have ‘‘unpredictable’’ hemodynamic
responses. clinical studies are needed to specifically address
these issues. additional studies are also needed to further
examine the mechanisms of developmental regulation of
net and the dysregulation potentially imposed by cocaine
exposure.
