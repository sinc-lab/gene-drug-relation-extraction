evidence for an alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtype mediating adrenergic vasoconstriction in wistar normotensive and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensi...  we wished to characterise the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating renal vasoconstrictor responses in pentobarbital anaesthetised normotensive rats and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (spshr). renal nerve stimulation, close renal arterial administration of phenylephrine (pe, a mixed alpha 1a- and  xxxg86xxx  agonist) and  xxxd2601xxx  (a putative  xxxg85xxx  agonist) resulted in frequency and dose-dependent renal vasoconstrictor responses. both dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist amlodipine (200 micrograms kg-1 plus 50 micrograms kg-1 h-1 and twice this dose) and the  xxxg85xxx  antagonist 5-methylurapidil (5 micrograms kg-1 plus 1.25 micrograms kg-1 h-1 and twice this dose) suppressed renal nerve-, pe-, and  xxxd2601xxx -induced vasoconstrictions by between 21 and 59% (p < 0.05-0.001) in normotensive rats and spshr. the  xxxg86xxx  alkylating agonist chloroethylclonidine (5 micrograms kg-1 plus 1.25 micrograms kg-1 h-1 and twice this dose) attenuated renal nerve-mediated vasoconstrictions by 20% (p < 0.01), but not those induced by pe and  xxxd2601xxx . this pattern of agonist and blocking drug interaction suggests that the renal postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors require extracellular calcium and are sensitive to 5-methylurapidil, characteristics of the  xxxg85xxx  subtype. moreover, a similar situation exists at the renal resistance vessels of spshr.
