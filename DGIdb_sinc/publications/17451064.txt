effect of local (intracerebral and intracerebroventricular) administration of  xxxg2276xxx  inhibitor on the neuroendocrine dopaminergic neu...  hypothalamic dopamine (da), the physiological regulator of pituitary prolactin (prl) secretion, is synthesized in the neuroendocrine dopaminergic neurons that projects to the median eminence and the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland. the rate-limiting step of da biosynthesis is catalyzed by the phosphorylated, therefore activated,  xxxg2276xxx  (th) that produces l-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine from tyrosine. the aims of our present study were to investigate 1. the effect of local inhibition of the da biosynthesis in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus on prl release, and to get 2. some information whether the phosphorylated th is the target of enzyme inhibition or not.
