[the effect of second generation histamine antagonists on the heart].  the review summarizes recent progress in the study of the cardiac actions of second--generation antihistamines. terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx , two antihistamines of the second generation, are in vitro potent blockers of potassium channels (k+). it has been considered to be responsible for qt prolongation of the electrocardiogram and life--treating ventricular tachycardias called torsades de pointes. loratadine and  xxxd1846xxx , the major metabolite of loratadine were studied on a human cardiac k+ channel (hkv 1.5) cloned from human ventricle. parent compound and its metabolite in high concentration blocked hkv1.5 channels. however, loratadine (10 mumol/l) failed to inhibit herg  xxxg1232xxx  and herg k+. ebastine also inhibit potassium channels, cloned human kv 1.5. cetirizine was completely devoid of any inhibitory action on herg k+ channels in concentration up to 30 mumd/l. on the other hand terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  effectively blocked herg k+ channels with nanomolar affinities (330 and 480 nmol/l, respectively), whereas loratadine was about 300-fold less potent. fexofenadine--the major metabolite of terfenadine, does not block either herg or  xxxg1234xxx . the quinea pig model (in vitro) revealed that only terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx  and ebastine produced significant qt interval prolongation and arrhythmogenic effects. the other nonsedating antihistamines including cetirizine, loratadine and the major metabolite of ebastine (carabastine), terfenadine (feksofenadine) and  xxxd236xxx  (norastemizole) were devoid of qt interval prolongation and other adverse ecg effects.
