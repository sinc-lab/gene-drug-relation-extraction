effects of l-carnitine on growth performance, carcass composition, and metabolism of lipids in male broilers.  we studied the effects of l-carnitine on growth performance, carcass composition, and lipid metabolism in male broilers. six hundred male commercial broilers were allotted to five groups, each of which included three replicates (40 birds per replicate). the groups received the same basal diet supplemented with 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 mg/kg l-carnitine, respectively. the feeding trial showed that l-carnitine had no significant effect on daily gain or feed conversion. supplementation with l-carnitine (above 25 mg/kg) in the diet increased breast muscle yield (p < 0.05) and crude fat content of the muscles and decreased abdominal fat content (p < 0.05). addition of 50, 75, or 100 mg/kg l-carnitine to the diet decreased total activities of  xxxg825xxx , malic dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and  xxxg1337xxx  (p < 0.05) in the subcutaneous fat and total activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-i (p < 0.05) in breast muscles. the results of this study indicate that l-carnitine could reduce the deposit of subcutaneous fat by decreasing total activities of enzymes in the fat and enhance intramuscular fat by decreasing the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-i in breast muscles.
