 xxxg801xxx  (fms-related  xxxg2198xxx / xxxg801xxx /
 xxxg120xxx ) is a receptor  xxxg2198xxx  (rtk)
primarily expressed on hematopoietic
cells. in blasts from acute myelogenous
leukemia (aml) patients, 2 classes of
 xxxg801xxx  activating mutations have been identified: internal tandem duplication (itd)
mutations in the juxtamembrane domain
(25%-30% of patients) and point mutations in the kinase domain activation loop
(7%-8% of patients).  xxxg801xxx -itd mutations
are the most common molecular defect
identified in aml and have been shown to
be an independent prognostic factor for
decreased survival.  xxxg801xxx -itd is therefore
an attractive molecular target for therapy.

 xxxd3264xxx  is a recently described selective
inhibitor with selectivity for split kinase
domain rtks, including platelet-derived
growth factor receptors,  xxxg2413xxx  receptors, and kit.
we show that  xxxd3264xxx  also has potent
activity against wild-type  xxxg801xxx  (flt3wt),  xxxg801xxx -itd, and  xxxg801xxx  activation loop
( xxxg801xxx -asp835) mutants in phosphorylation assays.  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits  xxxg801xxx -driven
phosphorylation and induces apoptosis
in vitro. in addition,  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits flt3induced vegf production. the in vivo
efficacy of  xxxd3264xxx  was investigated in 2
 xxxg801xxx -itd models: a subcutaneous tumor
xenograft model and a bone marrow en-

graftment model. we show that  xxxd3264xxx 
(20 mg/kg/d) dramatically regresses flt3itd tumors in the subcutaneous tumor
xenograft model and prolongs survival in
the bone marrow engraftment model.
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
analysis in subcutaneous tumors showed
that a single administration of an efficacious drug dose potently inhibits flt3itd phosphorylation for up to 16 hours
following a single dose. these results
suggest that further exploration of
 xxxd3264xxx  activity in aml patients is warranted. (blood. 2003;101:3597-3605)

introduction
signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) is frequently
dysregulated in disease.  xxxg801xxx  (fms-related  xxxg2198xxx / xxxg801xxx /
 xxxg120xxx ) belongs to the type iii split-kinase domain family of
rtks, and is primarily expressed on immature hematopoietic
progenitors and also on some mature myeloid and lymphoid
cells.1-3  xxxg801xxx  is activated following binding of  xxxg801xxx  ligand
(fl), which causes receptor dimerization leading to increased
kinase activity and activation of downstream signaling pathways including  xxxg2216xxx , ras, and  xxxg1743xxx ⬘kinase.4-6  xxxg801xxx  normally
regulates survival and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor
cells, in particular by synergy with other rtks and cytokine
receptors.7-9  xxxg801xxx  is also expressed on acute myelogenous
leukemia (aml) cells from the majority of patients and
stimulates survival and proliferation of leukemic blasts.10-12
two classes of activating  xxxg801xxx  mutations have been identified
in aml patients: internal tandem duplication (itd) mutations in
the juxtamembrane region expressed in 25% to 30% of aml
patients, and point mutations in the activation loop of the kinase
domain found in approximately 7% of patients (for review, see
gilliland and griffin13). both classes of mutation result in constitutive  xxxg801xxx   xxxg2198xxx  activity and have been shown to
transform hematopoietic cell lines in vitro and in vivo.5,14 recently
kelly et al15 have reported that hematopoietic reconstitution with

primary bone marrow cells transduced with  xxxg801xxx -itd causes
myeloproliferative disease in mice, with a latency period of 40 to
60 days.  xxxg801xxx -itd has also been shown to cooperate with
 xxxg1785xxx –retinoic-acid receptor ␣ translocation to
induce leukemia in a mouse model.16
 xxxg801xxx -itd is the most frequently observed molecular defect
in aml and has been found in pediatric, adult, and elderly aml
patients at frequencies of 10% to 16%, 21% to 27%, and 24% to
34%, respectively.17-20  xxxg801xxx -itd has been shown to be the
single most significant poor prognosis factor in aml in several
recent independent studies.21-23 clinically,  xxxg801xxx -itd is associated with increased leukocytosis, increased blast count, increased relapse rate, decreased disease-free survival, and poor
overall survival. a recent study has shown that an increased ratio
of  xxxg801xxx -itd relative to wild-type  xxxg801xxx  ( xxxg801xxx -wt) confers a
poorer prognosis and that the  xxxg801xxx -wt allele is absent in a
minority of patients.24 the catalytic asp835 point mutation is
also associated with leukocytosis and poor prognosis, though
not as statistically significant as  xxxg801xxx -itd.25  xxxg801xxx  therefore
appears to be necessary for disease progression and is an
attractive target for consideration in aml therapies.

factor receptor 2 ( xxxg1274xxx ;  xxxg1274xxx ) may play a role in the

pathophysiology of aml by regulation of bone marrow angiogenesis. increased bone marrow vascularity and increased cellular
vegf levels are evident in aml patients and predict a poor
outcome.26-28 paracrine interactions between the bone marrow
microenvironment and aml blasts likely play a role in increasing
microvessel density and contributing to blast cell survival and
proliferation (for review see fiedler et al29). agents targeting
 xxxg1274xxx  may therefore also have clinical benefit in aml.
 xxxd3264xxx  is a small molecule that potently inhibits plateletderived growth factor receptors (pdgfr) ␣ and ␤,  xxxg800xxx ,
 xxxg1274xxx , and kit,30 and therefore has both direct antitumor and
antiangiogenic properties. in this report we demonstrate that
 xxxd3264xxx  also targets  xxxg801xxx .  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits phosphorylation of
wild-type  xxxg801xxx  ( xxxg801xxx -wt),  xxxg801xxx -itd, and  xxxg801xxx -asp835 in cell
line models. in vivo  xxxd3264xxx  dramatically regresses subcutaneous
 xxxg801xxx -itd tumors and increases survival in a  xxxg801xxx -itd bone
marrow engraftment model.  xxxd3264xxx  is currently in aml and
solid-tumor clinical trials.

materials and methods
cell lines
cell culture media and fetal bovine serum (fbs) were purchased from
gibco life technologies (gaithersburg, md). rs4;11 and mv4;11, human
leukemia cell lines that express  xxxg801xxx -wt and a  xxxg801xxx -itd mutation,
respectively,31 were obtained from american type culture collection
(atcc, manassas, va) (crl-1873 and crl-9591, respectively), and
propagated as described.31 oc1-aml5 cells ( xxxg801xxx -wt) were obtained
from sreesha srinivasa (pharmacia, st louis, mo) and maintained in rpmi
1640 with 10% fbs supplemented with 1 ng/ml each of recombinant
human fl, granulocyte  xxxg526xxx  (g-csf), granulocytemacrophage csf (gm-csf), and kit ligand (r&d systems, minneapolis,
mn). chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells were maintained in f12 (ham)
media with 10% fbs.
site-directed mutagenesis and transfection
 xxxg801xxx  cdna was generously provided by dr olivier rosnet (molecular
oncology unit, institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale
[inserm], marseille, france) and cloned into an internal ribosomal entry
site–enhanced green fluorescent protein (ires-egfp) plasmid (clontech,
palo alto, ca). site-directed mutagenesis was used to create itd or
activation loop mutations (quickchange kit, stratagene, la jolla, ca), and
the mutations were confirmed by bidirectional sequencing. cho cells were
transfected with ires-egfp  xxxg801xxx  using lipofectamine as directed (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca).
cell proliferation, apoptosis, and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (elisas)
cell lines were starved overnight in medium containing 0.1% fbs prior to
addition of  xxxd3264xxx  and fl (50 ng/ml;  xxxg801xxx -wt cells only). proliferation
was measured after 48 hours of culture using the alamar blue assay
(alamar biosciences, sacramento, ca) in triplicate for each condition, as
described by the manufacturer. trypan blue cell viability assays were
performed in parallel and yielded similar results.
vegf elisas on culture supernatants were performed at 72 hours of
culture in triplicate for each condition, as directed by the manufacturer
(quantiglo human vegf immunoassay kit, r&d systems).
apoptosis was measured 24 hours after compound addition by western
blotting to detect cleavage of poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) or
levels of caspase-3. cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm tris
[tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane], ph 7.5; 137 mm nacl; 10% glycerol;
1% nonidet p-40 [np-40]; 0.1% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  [sds]; 2 mm
edta [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]) containing protease and phospha-

tase inhibitors (50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2
mm  xxxd502xxx , 1.2 ␮m aprotinin, 40 ␮m  xxxd3463xxx , 5.6 ␮m e-64, 4 ␮m
leupeptin, and 4 ␮m pepstatin a). equivalent amounts of protein were
separated by sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page), and then
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were probed with an
anti-parp antibody (cell signaling technology, beverly, ma) or caspase-3
(upstate biotechnology, lake placid, ny).
immunoprecipitation and western blot (ip/w) analysis
for in vitro experiments, cells were treated with  xxxd3264xxx  for 2 hours in
medium containing 0.1% fbs. cells expressing  xxxg801xxx -wt were stimulated
with 150 ng/ml fl for 5 minutes. cells were lysed as described above.
equivalent amounts of protein from each sample were immunoprecipitated
overnight at 4°c with an agarose-conjugated anti- xxxg801xxx  antibody (santa
cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca). immune complexes were washed
(150 mm nacl; 1.5 mm mgcl2; 50 mm hepes [n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n⬘-2-ethanesulfonic acid], ph 7.5; 10% glycerol; 0.1% triton x-100;
and 1 mm egta [ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid]), and, following
sds-page, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were probed with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (upstate biotechnology, lake placid, ny, or transduction laboratories, lexington, ky)
and then stripped with restore western blot stripping buffer (pierce,
rockford, il). membranes were reprobed with an anti- xxxg801xxx  antibody
(santa cruz biotechnology).  xxxg2216xxx  antibodies for immunprecipitation and
western blot analysis were from upstate biotechnology and transduction
laboratories, respectively.
in vivo models
prior to implantation, cells were harvested during exponential growth,
washed once with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), and, for
subcutaneous injection, resuspended in matrigel (bd biosciences, bedford,
ma). all animal studies were carried out with the approval of the sugen
institutional animal care and use committee in an association for
assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care (aaalac)
international accredited animal facility and were in accordance with the
institute of laboratory animal research (national institutes of health,
bethesda, md) guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.32
female athymic nu/nu mice (8 to 12 weeks old) were purchased from
charles river laboratories (wilmington, ma) and female nonobese
diabetic– xxxg1176xxx  (nod-scid) mice from
jackson laboratories (bar harbor, me). all animals were maintained under
clean room conditions in sterile microisolator cages (allentown caging
equipment, allentown, nj) with sani-chips (pj murphy, forest products,
montville, nj) and were provided sterile rodent chow and water ad libitum.
subcutaneous model. athymic nu/nu mice received subcutaneous
injections into the hind flank on day 0 with 5 ⫻ 106 mv4;11 or rs4;11
cells. in vivo experiments were scheduled to evaluate the therapeutic effects
of daily oral administration of  xxxd3264xxx  on pre-existing tumors (size
300-500 mm3) in all studies. animals were randomized into treatment
groups of 10 mice each for efficacy studies and 2 to 3 mice each for target
modulation studies. a range of doses of  xxxd3264xxx  or its vehicle were
administered, as indicated in figure legends.  xxxd3264xxx  was delivered orally
(po) in a citrate-buffered solution (ph 3.5) by gavage. tumor growth was
measured twice weekly using vernier calipers (fowler, des plaines, il) for
the duration of the treatment. tumor volumes were calculated as the product
of length ⫻ width ⫻ height.
target modulation. mice bearing tumors were administered a single
oral dose of  xxxd3264xxx  at the indicated concentrations. control animals
received either no treatment (predose) or vehicle. at the indicated times
after dosing, individual mice were killed, their tumors resected, and a blood
sample taken by cardiac puncture using a syringe primed with heparin
sulfate. pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma and generation of tumor lysates
were performed as described.30 ip/w analysis was performed as described
for in vitro experiments.
bone marrow model. nod-scid mice were pretreated with cyclophosphamide ( xxxd1779xxx , pharmacia, kalamazoo, mi) by intraperitoneal injection
of 150 mg/kg/d for 2 days,33 followed by 24 hours of rest prior to

blood, 1 may 2003 䡠 volume 101, number 9

intravenous injection of 5 ⫻ 106 cells via the tail vein. at experimental end
points (within 90 days of implantation) mice were anesthetized, followed
by terminal blood collection via intracardiac puncture. bone marrow cell
suspensions were prepared by flushing mouse femurs with cold, sterile
pbs. a range of doses of  xxxd3264xxx  or its vehicle were orally administered
once daily, as indicated in figure and table legends. for all studies, a paired
student t test was used to assess differences between treated and control
groups (p ⬍ .05 was considered significant).
flow cytometric analysis. for flow cytometric analysis of bone
marrow samples, erythrocytes were lysed using cal-lyse (caltag laboratories, burlingame, ca) following the manufacturer’s protocol. the percentage of human cells in bone marrow was determined by staining with
phycoerythrin-conjugated antihuman cd45 (pharmingen, san diego, ca)
and isotype controls. samples were analyzed on a becton dickinson
facscalibur flow cytometer. data analysis was performed using cellquest.
histopathology and ihc. sections were prepared from formalin-fixed,
decalcified, and paraffin-embedded mouse tibias. general tissue morphology and microvessels were visualized using conventional hematoxylin and
eosin (h&e) staining. cell proliferation was visualized using the mib-1
monoclonal antibody for ki-67 (immunotech, westbrook, me) and biotinylated polyclonal rabbit antimouse secondary antibody (zymed, south san
francisco, ca), using a peroxidase-based immunostaining protocol (vectastain abc elite kit, vector laboratories, burlingame, ca).

results
 xxxd3264xxx  inhibits  xxxg801xxx -wt,  xxxg801xxx -itd, and
 xxxg801xxx -asp835 mutant phosphorylation

 xxxd3264xxx  was designed to have broad selectivity for the split kinase
family of rtks and potently inhibits pdgfr␣, pdgfr␤,  xxxg1274xxx 
( xxxg1274xxx ),  xxxg800xxx  ( xxxg800xxx ), and kit, as recently described.30 given
the sequence conservation between  xxxg801xxx  and other members of the
class iii rtk family, we reasoned that  xxxd3264xxx  may also inhibit
 xxxg801xxx . to investigate  xxxd3264xxx  activity, cellular assays to detect
changes in  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation were performed using leukemia
cell lines rs;411 (which expresses wild-type  xxxg801xxx ) and mv4;11
(which expresses  xxxg801xxx -itd mutant).31 for both cell lines, ip/w
analysis showed 2 forms of  xxxg801xxx  protein, a higher (⬇ 160 kda)
and lower (135 kda) molecular weight form that likely correspond
to mature and immature forms of  xxxg801xxx  expressed on the cell
surface and intracellularly, respectively.2 in rs4;11 cells (flt3wt), addition of fl was necessary to stimulate  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation, and, as predicted, primarily the higher molecular weight
(likely extracellular)  xxxg801xxx  species was phosphorylated. as shown
in figure 1a, treatment with  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited  xxxg801xxx -wt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner with a 50% inhibitory
concentration (ic50) of approximately 250 nm. similar results were
obtained in the oc1-aml5 human leukemia cell line, which also
expresses  xxxg801xxx -wt, as assessed by genotyping (data not shown).

figure 1.  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits  xxxg801xxx -wt and  xxxg801xxx -itd phosphorylation. (a) rs4;11
and (b) mv4;11 cells were incubated with  xxxd3264xxx  at the indicated concentrations
for 2 hours. for rs4;11 only, cells were stimulated for 5 minutes with fl (150 ng/ml).
lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an anti- xxxg801xxx  antibody. after
sds-page and transfer to nitrocellulose, the blots were probed with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (top) and subsequently stripped and reprobed with an anti- xxxg801xxx 
antibody (bottom). similar results were obtained in at least 4 independent experiments.

 xxxd3264xxx  is a novel  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor

3599

in mv4;11 cells that express  xxxg801xxx -itd, it is noteworthy that both
high and low molecular weight forms of  xxxg801xxx  are phosphorylated
in the absence of  xxxg801xxx  ligand (fl), consistent with expression of
 xxxg801xxx -itd (figure 1b).  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited  xxxg801xxx -itd phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner with an ic50 of 50 nm following
a 2-hour treatment (figure 1b). in 5 separate experiments, ic50
values ranged from 10 to 60 nm for  xxxg801xxx -itd, with a mean of 50
nm (data not shown).
to address whether the apparent difference in sensitivity of
 xxxg801xxx -wt and  xxxg801xxx -itd to  xxxd3264xxx  could be attributed to use of
these nonisogenic cell lines, a 32d myeloid cell line engineered to
express  xxxg801xxx -wt or  xxxg801xxx -itd5 was tested.  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited
32d: xxxg801xxx -wt phosphorylation with an ic50 of approximately 250
nm; while 32d: xxxg801xxx -itd was inhibited with an ic50 of 50 nm
(data not shown). these cell lines showed similar levels of  xxxg801xxx 
cell surface staining when assessed by flow cytometry analysis. it
therefore appears that  xxxg801xxx -itd has increased sensitivity to
 xxxd3264xxx  relative to  xxxg801xxx -wt.
we also investigated the activity of  xxxd3264xxx  against  xxxg801xxx 
activation loop mutations using transiently transfected cho cells.
for cho cells expressing  xxxg801xxx -wt, treatment with  xxxg801xxx  ligand
stimulated phosphorylation, and  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited phosphorylation with an ic50 of approximately 30 nm (figure 2).  xxxg801xxx  was
constitutively phosphorylated in all cells expressing mutant  xxxg801xxx .
 xxxd3264xxx  inhibited phosphorylation of  xxxg801xxx -itd with an ic50 of
less than 10 nm. similarly, phosphorylation of activation loop
mutants asp835tyr, asp835val, and asp835his was inhibited by
 xxxd3264xxx , with ic50 values of 30 to 300 nm (figure 2). taken
together these data demonstrate that  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits phosphorylation of  xxxg801xxx -wt,  xxxg801xxx -itd, and  xxxg801xxx -asp835 mutant forms
of  xxxg801xxx .
 xxxd3264xxx  inhibits proliferation induced by  xxxg801xxx -itd
and  xxxg801xxx -wt

having demonstrated that  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation, the biologic consequence of inhibition was tested in cell
proliferation and apoptosis assays. for the  xxxg801xxx -itd cell line
mv4;11,  xxxd3264xxx  dramatically inhibited cellular proliferation in a
dose-dependent manner with an ic50 of 1 to 10 nm (figure 3a). we
used the factor-dependent  xxxg801xxx -wt cell line, oc1-aml5, to
investigate the effect of  xxxd3264xxx  on proliferation driven by
 xxxg801xxx -wt. addition of fl stimulated an approximately 3-fold
increase in oc1-aml5 cell number over 48 hours (data not
shown).  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited proliferation of oc1-aml5 with an
ic50 of approximately 10 nm in the presence of  xxxg801xxx  ligand
(figure 3a). the mean ic50 values for inhibition of proliferation of
mv4;11 and oc1-aml5 cells at 48 hours were 8 nm and 14 nm,
respectively, in at least 3 independent experiments. similar results
were apparent in trypan blue viable cell count assays, in which
 xxxd3264xxx  inhibited expansion of mv4;11 and oc1-aml5 cell
lines in a dose-dependent manner, with ic50 values in the 10 to 50
nm range. rs4;11 cells ( xxxg801xxx -wt) are not factor-dependent and
addition of  xxxg801xxx  ligand induced only a modest increase in
proliferation. accordingly  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited  xxxg801xxx  ligand–
stimulated proliferation in rs4;11 cells with an ic50 of more than
500 nm (data not shown).
next the ability of  xxxd3264xxx  to induce apoptosis was assessed
using measurement of parp cleavage and caspase-3 levels as
indicators. for  xxxg801xxx -itd–expressing cells (mv4;11) a low level
of cleaved parp was evident at baseline. addition of  xxxd3264xxx 
increased parp cleavage (89-kda and 24-kda fragments) in a
dose-dependent manner, evident  xxxd1891xxx  nm  xxxd3264xxx , with a

transiently transfected with dna encoding wild-type (top) or mutant (bottom)  xxxg801xxx 
and incubated with  xxxd3264xxx  at indicated concentrations for one hour. following
treatment, cho cells transfected with  xxxg801xxx -wt were stimulated with fl (100 ng/ml)
for 10 minutes. lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an anti- xxxg801xxx 
antibody. following transfer to nitrocellulose, blots were initially probed with an
antiphosphotyrosine antibody and subsequently stripped and reprobed with an
anti- xxxg801xxx  antibody.

(n ⫽ 10) (figure 4a). daily administration of  xxxd3264xxx  was ceased
8 days after full regression was observed to determine if the effect
of  xxxd3264xxx  was reversible. this resulted in eventual regrowth of 6
of 10 tumors, with no regrowth in the remaining 4 (2 of which were
observed for 10 months after treatment stopped). of the regrowing
tumors, 4 were again treated with 40 mg/kg/d of  xxxd3264xxx  when
they reached approximately 2000 mm3. all of these tumors
responded dramatically to the second treatment with 40 mg/kg of
daily  xxxd3264xxx , suggesting that tumors had not developed resistance (figure 4b).
when tumors from the vehicle control group in figure 4a
reached approximately 2000 mm3, these mice were treated with
 xxxd3264xxx , resulting in complete tumor regression. dosing was
ceased after an average of 23 days of treatment. of 10 mice, 2
exhibited tumor regrowth, while 8 mice exhibited no regrowth after
2.5 months (2 of which are still viable and remain tumor-free after 9
months). daily treatment with  xxxd3264xxx  was well tolerated, with no
signs of gross toxicity. the rapid regression of the  xxxg801xxx -itd–
expressing cell line mv4;11 by  xxxd3264xxx  is consistent with
dependence on constitutive  xxxg801xxx  signaling for survival.
since 40 mg/kg/d of  xxxd3264xxx  caused profound tumor regression, lower daily doses of  xxxd3264xxx  (20, 5, and 1 mg/kg/d) were
evaluated to determine the lowest efficacious dose. in mice
receiving 20 mg/kg/d of  xxxd3264xxx , complete tumor regression was
apparent although not as rapidly as observed with the 40 mg/kg/d
dose (figure 4c). for the lower dose of 5 mg/kg/d, a marginal but
insignificant effect on tumor growth was apparent, and 1 mg/kg/d
had no effect. in a separate study a 10 mg/kg dose induced tumor
growth inhibition but not regression (data not shown). these
efficacy studies confirm dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth

concomitant decrease in full-length parp (figure 3b). similarly, a
dose-dependent increase in levels of the proteolytic (active)
fragment of caspase-3 was observed in the presence of  xxxd3264xxx 
(figure 3d). similar observations were made using facs analysis
for active caspase-3 (data not shown). for oc1-aml5 cells,
cleaved parp and caspase-3 were evident within a similar dose
range (figure 3c,e), although the magnitude of cell death in
cultures was less than mv4;11 cells. rs4;11 cells did not undergo
apoptosis in the presence of  xxxd3264xxx , consistent with a lack of
dependence on  xxxg801xxx  for survival (data not shown). taken together,
these data suggest that  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits proliferation driven by
both  xxxg801xxx -wt and  xxxg801xxx -itd, resulting in apoptosis.
 xxxd3264xxx  causes dramatic regression of large subcutaneous
 xxxg801xxx -itd tumors in athymic mice

having determined that  xxxd3264xxx  is a potent inhibitor of  xxxg801xxx  in
vitro, we evaluated the in vivo activity of this compound using a
 xxxg801xxx -itd tumor model. subcutaneous implantation of mv4;11
cells expressing  xxxg801xxx -itd into athymic mice resulted in growth of
solid tumors of approximately 500 mm3 within 4 weeks; tumors
continued to increase in size until mice were killed. immunohistochemical staining for ki67 demonstrated a high proliferation index,
consistent with the rapid tumor growth rate. in addition strong
 xxxg801xxx  expression on tumor cells was observed (data not shown).
we previously reported that  xxxd3264xxx  dosed orally at 40
mg/kg/d is fully efficacious in a number of subcutaneous tumor
xenograft models, including sf763t and colo205.30 therefore, the
40 mg/kg/d dose was initially tested for efficacy in mice bearing

daily oral administration of (a)  xxxd3264xxx  at 40 mg/kg/d or (c) a
dose response of 20, 5, and 1 mg/kg/d was initiated when mv4;11
tumors reached an average of 400 mm3 volume. (a) additionally,
 xxxd3264xxx  (f) was administered to mice bearing large tumors
(2000 mm3) from the original vehicle-treated control group (f).
(b) in mice with fully regressed tumors, dosing of  xxxd3264xxx  at 40
mg/kg/d was ceased and tumor regrowth occurred in some
animals. when tumor volume exceeded 1000 mm3,  xxxd3264xxx 
administration at 40 mg/kg/d recommenced to evaluate any
alteration in sensitivity to the compound (4 mice). tumor volume
was measured on the indicated days, with the mean tumor
volume ⫾ sem indicated for each group, each of which consisted
of 10 mice (excluding panel b). (d) athymic mice bearing
established mv4;11 tumor xenografts were given a single oral
dose of  xxxd3264xxx  (40 mg/kg) or citrate buffer vehicle; predose
animals received no treatment.  xxxg801xxx  (top panel) or  xxxg2216xxx  (bottom
panel) were immunoprecipitated from tumor lysates, and western blots were probed for  xxxd1075xxx  or phospho- xxxg2216xxx ,
respectively. blots were reprobed for total  xxxg801xxx  or  xxxg2216xxx . each

by  xxxd3264xxx  and demonstrate that 20 mg/kg/d is the minimal
efficacious dose to induce regression.
to assess  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation in tumor cells, tumor
(mv4;11)–bearing mice were treated with vehicle control or a
single dose of  xxxd3264xxx  (40 mg/kg). analysis of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation by ip/w showed high levels of phosphorylation in tumor
lysates from predose (untreated) or vehicle-treated animals
(n ⫽ 3 per group).  xxxg801xxx  protein levels were not altered by
 xxxd3264xxx  but  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation was dramatically suppressed in all  xxxd3264xxx -treated animals within 4 hours (figure
4d). analysis of a downstream  xxxg801xxx -itd signaling protein,
 xxxg2216xxx , showed similarly decreased phosphorylation;  xxxg2216xxx  was
highly activated at baseline in both vehicle and untreated
animals and markedly inhibited by a single administration of
 xxxd3264xxx  (figure 4d).
establishment of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
(pk/pd) relationship for  xxxg801xxx -itd inhibition in vivo

establishment of a pk/pd relationship is an important aspect for
translation of preclinical data to clinical trials. we have reported

that  xxxd3264xxx  exhibits predictable and dose-dependent pharmacokinetics in mice.30 to define the pk/pd relationship for  xxxd3264xxx  in
modulation of  xxxg801xxx -itd in vivo, we first addressed the kinetics of
inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation at 20 mg/kg  xxxd3264xxx , the
lowest dose inducing tumor regression. after a single dose of
 xxxd3264xxx , tumors were removed at various time points for analysis
of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation, and plasma was simultaneously collected
for analysis of drug levels. the single  xxxd3264xxx  administration
completely inhibited  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation within 2 hours, for at
least 12 to 16 hours (figure 5a). at 24 and 48 hours, phosphorylation increased, although levels remained lower than those observed
in tumors from untreated animals. plasma inhibitor levels are
indicated in figure 5 and showed expected concentrations and
kinetics: a dose of 20 mg/kg produced a maximal concentration
(cmax) of more than 100 ng/ml (⬇ 250 nm) within 2 hours and
plasma drug levels were less than 1 ng/ml at 16 hours after dosing.
the observed inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation at 12 and 16
hours, when plasma drug levels were less than 1 ng/ml, may reflect
the duration of  xxxg801xxx  inhibition once target plasma concentration is
attained (below).

figure 5. inhibition of  xxxg801xxx -itd phosphorylation by  xxxd3264xxx  is time- and dose-dependent. (a) athymic mice carrying established mv4;11 tumor xenografts were given a
single oral dose of  xxxd3264xxx  (20 mg/kg) or citrate buffer vehicle; predose animals received no treatment. tumors were harvested at the indicated times, and  xxxg801xxx  was analyzed
by ip/w for  xxxd1075xxx , followed by total  xxxg801xxx . each lane represents a separate animal, and plasma drug concentrations are indicated below for each. nd indicates not
detectable. (b) experiment performed as in panel a except that mice received  xxxd3264xxx  at either 20, 5, or 1 mg/kg for the indicated times.

next, the effects of subefficacious (5 mg/kg) and nonefficacious
(1 mg/kg) doses of  xxxd3264xxx  were examined at 2, 4, and 8 hours
after administration, as shown in figure 5b. a single dose of
 xxxd3264xxx  at 5 mg/kg inhibited  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation at 2 hours
with less inhibition at 4 and 8 hours. inhibition was weaker and
more transient than that observed with 20 mg/kg (figure 5b). the
nonefficacious dose of 1 mg/kg marginally inhibited  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation. quantitation of western blots using quantity one software
(biorad, hercules, ca) supported these observations (data not
shown). it therefore appears that strong (⬎ 50%) inhibition of
 xxxg801xxx -itd phosphorylation maintained for 8 to 16 hours correlates
with regression in this model. additional pk/pd analysis comparing different drug doses suggested that a target plasma concentration of 30 to 50 ng/ml for at least 8 hours correlated with robust
sustained inhibition of  xxxg801xxx -itd, attained with 20 mg/kg and not
with 5 mg/kg. this is slightly lower than, but in a similar range to,
that predicted for pdgfr and  xxxg1274xxx  (50-100 ng/ml).30 these data
show that inhibition of  xxxg801xxx -itd phosphorylation by  xxxd3264xxx  is
dose-dependent, and the magnitude and extent of  xxxg801xxx  inhibition
at 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg correlate with results of the efficacy
experiments.

regions as well as diffuse infiltration (figure 6c). mv4;11 cells had
strong nuclear immunoreactivity for ki67, while other cells stained
weakly. bone marrow from mv4;11-inoculated mice also appeared
highly vascularized (data not shown). treatment with  xxxd3264xxx  at
20 mg/kg/d resulted in reduced numbers of bone marrow mv4;11
cells when examined on day 50. in some cases, only a few leukemic
cells distributed throughout the bone marrow remained, while other
samples exhibited no evidence of leukemic cells, which correlated
with lack of overt disease symptoms (figure 6c). these data show

 xxxd3264xxx  enhances survival in a bone marrow
engraftment model

having shown that  xxxd3264xxx  regresses  xxxg801xxx -itd tumors in a
subcutaneous tumor model, we investigated the effects of  xxxd3264xxx 
in a more physiologically relevant leukemia model in which cells
engraft in the bone marrow, established using mv4;11 cells. mice
were sublethally pretreated with cyclophosphamide33 to reduce the
endogenous bone marrow cell population and facilitate engraftment before intravenous injection of 5 ⫻ 106 mv4;11 cells. flow
cytometric analysis of human cd45 expression in bone marrow
was performed to provide evidence of disease. human cells were
detectable in bone marrow approximately 4 weeks after cell
inoculation. clinically, within 40 to 50 days mice exhibited hind
limb paralysis, ruffled fur, and decreased spontaneous activity
(grooming and ambulation).
to study the effect of  xxxd3264xxx  on survival, once-daily treatment with either  xxxd3264xxx  or vehicle was initiated 3 weeks after
mv4;11 cell implantation. animals were continued on the assigned
 xxxd3264xxx  or vehicle treatment regimen until sufficient clinical
evidence of symptomatic disease progression (eg, hind limb
paralysis or morbidity) was present to warrant humane killing. all
vehicle control group mice died within 39 to 50 days, with a mean
survival time of 41 days (figure 6a). mice on the  xxxd3264xxx  arm
demonstrated prolonged dose-dependent survival. with 5, 10, and
20 mg/kg/d of orally administered  xxxd3264xxx , the mean survival
time was significantly prolonged to 46, 56, and at least 83 days,
respectively (p ⫽ .002, p ⬍ .0001, p ⬍ .0001, respectively). accompanying the increase in survival time,  xxxd3264xxx -treated mice
demonstrated a marked lack of hind limb paralysis, a healthierappearing coat, and more normal levels of physical activity, while
the vehicle-treated mice had succumbed to disease. facs analysis
showed that vehicle-treated animals had an average of 49% human
cd45⫹ cells in bone marrow (range, 19%-73%) while su11248treated mice had an average of 2.3% (figure 6b). in control mice
pretreated with cyclophosphamide but not inoculated with mv4;11
cells, less than 1% human cd45⫹ cells were detected in the
bone marrow.
morphologic examination of h&e-stained bone marrow sections from untreated or vehicle-treated animals showed large cells
with pale nuclei and abundant mitotic figures in locally abundant

(10 mice per group). mice exhibiting hind limb paralysis or signs of moribundity were

marrow disease, with similar dose-dependence to the subcutaneous model.
 xxxd3264xxx  decreases vegf levels following  xxxg801xxx  signaling

increased microvessel density and increased  xxxg1274xxx  expression26,27 has been reported in bone marrow of aml patients,
relative to healthy donors, and it has been proposed that paracrine
growth stimulatory interactions occur between blasts and endothelial cells.29 vegf binding to its receptor  xxxg1274xxx  ( xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx ) is
one of the best-characterized positive inducers of tumor neovascularization by the stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation and
migration34 (for reviews see ferrara and gerber35; albitar36; and
rosen37). to assess the effects of  xxxg801xxx -itd signaling on vegf
production, we measured vegf levels in tissue culture supernatants from cell lines. mv4;11 ( xxxg801xxx -itd) cells constitutively
produced relatively high levels of vegf, ranging from 35 to 92
pg/ml per 105 cells. culture in the presence of  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited
vegf production in a dose-dependent manner with an ic50 of
approximately 10 nm (table 1). when vegf levels were normalized for viable cell number the inhibitory effect was still apparent,
suggesting that the reduced vegf levels are not simply a reflection
of decreased cell number in the presence of  xxxd3264xxx , but more
likely due to decreased signaling in viable cells. to assess if vegf
production is specific to leukemia cell lines, similar experiments
were performed in 32d: xxxg801xxx -itd cells and murine vegf was
measured. we observed that 32d: xxxg801xxx -itd cells constitutively
produced vegf (data not shown).
analysis of  xxxg801xxx -wt cells showed that vegf was barely
detectable in 72-hour culture supernatants from rs4;11 cells (⬍ 1
pg/ml per 105 cells), while oc1-aml5 cells produced low levels
(32 pg/ml per 105 cells). however addition of  xxxg801xxx  ligand
increased vegf production by 3- to 4-fold in each cell line, and
this effect was inhibited by  xxxd3264xxx  (table 1). we also measured
human vegf levels in plasma from a survival study in the mv4;11
bone marrow engraftment model. in naive mice (n ⫽ 4) vegf was
not detected. in mv4;11-inoculated mice with hind limb paralysis
treated with vehicle, vegf was detectable in 9 of 9 cases (mean 49
pg/ml, range). vegf was not detected in any of 6 apparently
healthy mv4;11-inoculated mice treated with  xxxd3264xxx  at 20
mg/kg daily. these data suggest that signaling downstream of both
 xxxg801xxx -wt and  xxxg801xxx -itd results in vegf production, which is
inhibited by  xxxd3264xxx . vegf is a potential marker for  xxxg801xxx -itd
in vivo.

discussion
aml is a malignant disorder of hematopoietic progenitor cells and
constitutes approximately 90% of adult acute leukemia. as the vast

3603

majority of adults who develop aml eventually succumb to their
disease or associated cytotoxic therapy, there is an urgent need for
new therapies. the  xxxg801xxx -itd mutation is the most common
molecular defect in aml and confers poor prognosis. in this report
we have characterized  xxxd3264xxx  as a  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor. we show that
 xxxd3264xxx  inhibits phosphorylation of  xxxg801xxx -itd,  xxxg801xxx -asp835, as
well as  xxxg801xxx -wt, which results in inhibition of proliferation and
induction of apoptosis in vitro. consistent with these observations,
 xxxd3264xxx  had dramatic efficacy in a  xxxg801xxx -itd xenograft model
and also in a bone marrow engraftment model. analysis of
 xxxd3264xxx  effects on  xxxg801xxx -itd phosphorylation in tumor xenografts showed a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation, and a pk/pd relationship was established. finally,  xxxd3264xxx 
treatment can abrogate vegf production, secondary to
 xxxg801xxx  signaling.
in cellular assays,  xxxd3264xxx  potently inhibited  xxxg801xxx -itd
phosphorylation with an ic50 of 50 nm, similar to those reported
for other rtk targets of  xxxd3264xxx .30  xxxd3264xxx  exhibited a relative
increase in potency for inhibition of  xxxg801xxx -itd phosphorylation
relative to  xxxg801xxx -wt when assayed in different cell lines that
express either endogenous or overexpressed  xxxg801xxx  and also when
assayed in transiently transfected cho cells. there are several
possibilities to account for this effect:  xxxd3264xxx  may bind to
 xxxg801xxx -itd with increased affinity due to differences in conformation between wt and itd; accessibility to drug may be influenced
by differences in cellular localization; or levels of ligand necessary
to stimulate phosphorylation of  xxxg801xxx -wt in vitro may be nonphysiologic. irrespective of the mechanism, our data demonstrate that
 xxxd3264xxx  inhibits phosphorylation of both mutant  xxxg801xxx  and
 xxxg801xxx -wt, and may have an increased potency for  xxxg801xxx -itd
relative to  xxxg801xxx -wt.  xxxd3264xxx  also inhibited phosphorylation of
asp835 point mutations, asp835val, asp835his, and asp835tyr.
as anticipated, the biologic consequences of  xxxg801xxx  inhibition
were most profound in mv4;11 cells where  xxxg801xxx -itd appears to
drive proliferation. proliferation was inhibited by  xxxd3264xxx  with an
ic50 of 1 to 10 nm, resulting in apoptosis.  xxxd3264xxx  also inhibited
fl-driven proliferation in the  xxxg801xxx -wt cell line oc1-aml5,
most likely because this cell line undergoes apoptosis in the
absence of added cytokines and fl maintains survival. it is
unlikely that the effects of  xxxd3264xxx  on mv4;11 cells are mediated
by targeting other rtks, as mv4;11 cells do not appear to express
pdgfr; and while weak expression of kit was detected, no
phosphorylation was apparent in ip/w experiments (data not
shown).  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation in rs4;11 cells,
but this cell line is more than 100-fold less sensitive to  xxxd3264xxx 
than mv4;11 in biologic assays. this can be attributed to the lack
of requirement for  xxxg801xxx  signaling for survival or proliferation in
rs4;11, and also demonstrates that  xxxd3264xxx  does not have
nonspecific effects. these data are consistent with observations of

table 1. mv4;11 cells were cultured in the absence of fl with  xxxd3264xxx  as indicated

o’farrell et al

levis et al38 who reported that  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation was inhibited
by  xxxd2458xxx , a different  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor, in the bv173 cell line, but
cells did not undergo apoptosis. it is likely that inhibition of
additional signaling pathways is necessary to elicit a cytotoxic
response in rs4;11.
a subcutaneous tumor xenograft model was used to assess the
effects of  xxxd3264xxx  in vivo and to help define the pk/pd
relationship for  xxxg801xxx -itd, important for the translation of this
compound to clinical testing. we found that  xxxd3264xxx  dramatically
regressed  xxxg801xxx -itd xenografts in a dose-dependent manner, with
a minimum fully efficacious dose of 20 mg/kg/d most likely acting
as a direct antitumor agent. this dose is lower than that identified
for inhibition of other human tumor cell line xenografts such as
sf763t and colo205 (40 mg/kg/d). in these models  xxxd3264xxx  may
act primarily as an  xxxg482xxx ,30 targeting  xxxg1274xxx /
 xxxg1274xxx  and pdgfr expressed in tumor endothelium and/or stroma.
since  xxxd3264xxx  does not have increased potency against  xxxg801xxx  in
cellular phosphorylation assays relative to pdgfr or  xxxg1274xxx 
(ic50 approximately 10 nm for pdgfr␣, pdgfr␤, and
vegfr230), the increased sensitivity in vivo may reflect the high
level of constitutive  xxxg801xxx  activity and/or causative role of flt3itd in maintaining mv4;11 cell survival and proliferation, such
that  xxxg801xxx  inhibition has catastrophic effects on tumor survival. in
tumor models in which  xxxg1274xxx  and pdgfr were assessed, a
plasma concentration of 50 to 100 ng/ml sustained for 12 hours led
to durable inhibition of phosphorylation by  xxxd3264xxx .30 for
 xxxg801xxx -itd we show that the plasma drug concentration that
corresponds to strong and durable inhibition is lower (approximately 30 ng/ml), consistent with efficacy in the  xxxg801xxx -itd
model at a lower dose. in patients, we would predict that
 xxxd3264xxx  doses that attain plasma concentrations of more than
30 ng/ml would be sufficient to inhibit  xxxg801xxx -itd phosphorylation. in the bone marrow engraftment model, a more representative model of leukemia,  xxxd3264xxx  prolonged survival in 90% of
animals at the same dose (20 mg/kg) that sustained inhibition of
 xxxg801xxx -itd phosphorylation and was fully efficacious in the
subcutaneous model.
the target genes of  xxxg801xxx  signaling pathways that function in
oncogenesis have not been identified. we report the novel finding

that  xxxg801xxx  signaling leads to secretion of vegf in vitro, most
notably in  xxxg801xxx -itd cell lines. it seems likely that vegf is a
direct rather than indirect target of  xxxg801xxx  signal transduction
pathways, given that this effect was apparent in several cell lines
and also apparent following  xxxg801xxx -wt stimulation. a mechanism
may exist in aml by which  xxxg801xxx -induced vegf contributes to
bone marrow angiogenesis in a paracrine fashion and has autocrine
action on blast cells. it will be of significance to determine whether
blasts from  xxxg801xxx -itd–positive aml patients express higher levels
of vegf than those of  xxxg801xxx -wt patients.
the prognostic significance of  xxxg801xxx -itd mutations in clinical
studies suggests that  xxxg801xxx  plays a driving role in aml. recent
evidence in mouse models suggests that  xxxg801xxx -itd mutations alone
induce myeloproliferative disease, whereas additional mutations
are needed to induce aml.15,16 in addition to  xxxd3264xxx , several
other small-molecule  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors have been recently described, including ag1295,39  xxxd2642xxx ,40  xxxd3287xxx ,41  xxxd2458xxx ,38
 xxxd3191xxx ,31 and  xxxd3287xxx .42 each has a unique spectrum of activity
for other kinases including  xxxg1274xxx , pdgfr, kit, protein kinase
c (pkc), and  xxxg2198xxx  (trk). additional strategies to target
 xxxg801xxx  have also been defined, such as use of hsp90 inhibitors.43
 xxxd3264xxx  is orally bioavailable, can exert direct tumor inhibition by
targeting  xxxg801xxx  on blasts, and also has potent activity against
pdgfr and vegfr, which regulate angiogenesis, associated with
disease progression. the demonstration that  xxxd3264xxx  exhibits
sustained target inhibition and efficacy in  xxxg801xxx -itd models
suggests that this compound may have biologic activity in aml.
 xxxd3264xxx  is currently in phase 1 aml clinical trials.
