repeated positron emission tomography (pet) measurements of d, receptor occupancy, plasma concentrations of zuclopen-
thixol and reaction time were performed in three healthy subjects after injection of 12.5 mg  xxxd3568xxx  acetate (zpta) in an
open study design. five contro] subjects were examined for reaction time only. d, receptor occupancy was 51%, 71% and 75%
after 7 h and 75%, 83% and 87% after 31 h in the three subjects. the subjects reported sedation, but reaction time was not
prolonged. after the low dose of 12.5 mg zpta, d, receptor occupancy exceeded the 70% assumed to be required to induce
antipsychotic effect. extrapolation of data to a clinical dose interval indicates that 50-150 mg zpta should induce very high
d, receptor occupancy lasting several days after injection. such high doses may be required to induce sedation and to avoid
frequent intramuscular injections in acutely psychotic patients. however, the simultaneously induced very high d, receptor
occupancy calls for careful assessment of acute extrapyramidal symptoms.

introduction

it is generally assumed that the antipsychotic effect of
conventional neuroleptics is induced by blockade of
d, dopamine receptors (creese ez al., 1976; seeman ef
al, 1976). this hypothesis has been supported by sev-
eral studies with positron emission tomography (pet).
a high d, receptor occupancy is a consistent finding in
patients treated with antipsychotic drugs (farde ef al.,
1986; smith et al, 1988: baron er al, 1989).

in the emergency treatment of severe acute psy-
chotic disorders antipsychotic drugs with sedative
effects are often used. sedation usually becomes
manifest within the first few hours after drug adminis-
tration (amdisen e/a/., 1986). sedation can probably be
mediated by interaction with several different neuro-
receptors such as histamine, a-adrenergic, d, or d,
dopamine receptors (levander ef al, 1985, farde e7
al., 1989b: karlsson er al., 1995). during clinical treat-
ment with neuroleptics, sedation or drowsiness is a
well-known drug effect reported by the patient or that

may be inferred by an observer. however, there is no
generally accepted definition or measure for this phe-
nomenon. one suggested method of measuring seda-
tion has been to study attention and sensorimotor
functioning with reaction time tests (hindmarch,
1980; levander, 1987; king, 1990).

 xxxd3568xxx , the cis-isomer of the thioxanthene
derivative  xxxd3568xxx , is a well-established antipsy-
chotic drug (gravem and elgen, 1981). the acetate
ester of  xxxd3568xxx  (zpta) dissolved in a thin
vegetable oil (viscoleo®) is a formulation developed
for intramuscular injection in acute treatment of
severe psychoses where oral treatment is not feasible
(amdisen e7 a/., 1986, 1987). zpta has been shown
to induce sedation within a few hours after intramuscu-
lar injection (balant ef al., 1989; lowert er al., 1989;
baastrup e/ al., 1993; chouinard et al, 1994).

the aim of the present study was to determine the
early time course of d, receptor occupancy and
plasma concentrations of  xxxd3568xxx  after a
single low dose of zpta in healthy volunteers. drug-
induced sedation was measured by reaction time and
subjective ratings.

methods

the study was performed at the department of clini-
cal neuroscience, psychiatry section, karolinska insti-
tute. the study was approved by the ethics and the
isotope committees of the karolinska hospital, and
the medical products agency of sweden.

study design and drug administration

three healthy male volunteers (aged 25, 30 and 33
years) were recruited. they were healthy according
to medical history, physical examination, blood and
urine analysis, and computerized tomography (c1)
of the brain. the subjects had never previously re-
ceived antipsychotic drugs. five male subjects (aged
23, 35, 25, 19 and 27 years) were recruited as controls
for the reaction time tests. subjects with particular
motor proficiencies, such as playing of musical instru-
ments, were excluded.

this open exploratory study was performed during
two experimental sessions in each subject. in the first
session a pet experiment was performed to establish
baseline. in the second session an intramuscular injec-
tion of 12.5 mg zpta (0.25 ml  xxxd3568xxx -acutard®,
50 mg/ml, lundbeck a/s, denmark) was given. there-
after a series of four pet experiments was performed
at 2, 7 and 31 h and 14 days after drug administra-
tion. no concomitant medication was given.

the suggested clinical dose range of zpta is 50—
150 mg per administration (amdisen ez al., 1987). in
this explorative study in healthy subjects, the 12.5 mg
dose was chosen for safety and tolerability reasons.
the time schedule for the pet experiments was based
on the pharmacokinetics reported in clinical studies
on zpta (amdisen ef al, 1986; balant er al, 1989;
lowert et al., 1989), in which maximal plasma
concentration (c.,,,) occurred after about 36 h (t,,,),
and decreased to about one-third of c.,,, after 72 h
(amdisen ez al., 1986).

pharmacodynamics

the subjects were observed for 72 h after drug adminis-
tration. subjective experiences were noted after open
questioning, and a visual analogue scale (vas) was
administered at the end of each experimental day.
the subjects were asked to describe the nature, severi-
ty, onset and cessation of each event. attention and
sensorimotor functioning were measured by reaction
time (rt). tests were conducted twice for practice,
once as baseline and on 20 occasions during the 72 h
following drug administration. the tasks were adminis-
tered by a computerized system, the automated
psychological test system, on an apple ii microcom-
puter (levander, 1987). tests were given consecutively

222 international clinical psychopharmacology . vol 10 . 1995

s nyberg £7 4l.

in the same order for all subjects. the five control
subjects were tested according to the same time sched-
ule. the rt test comprised three tasks.

at1: simple visual rt (15 stimuli, 10 x 10mm white
square).

rt2: two-choice (left-right) visual ri (15 stimull,
square appearing 100 mm to the right or left of the
centre of the screen). response was given with the
corresponding hand.

rt3: two-choice visual ri with auditory inhibition
(25 stimuli). half of the visual stimuli were accompa-
nied by randomly presented auditory signals for inhibi-
tion. there was a visual forewarning |.5s before each
stimulus,

extrapyramidal syndromes (eps) were rated accord-
ing to “a rating scale for drug-induced akathisia”
(barnes, 1989) and “a rating scale for extrapyramidal
side effects (simpson and angus, 1970) on 26 occa-
sions during the 72 h of the second experimental
session.

 xxxd3568xxx  in plasma

blood samples (5 ml) were drawn 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 16,
24, 31, 48, 60 and 72 h after injection of zpta, and
after 14 days. plasma concentrations of zuclopen-
thixol were determined by a sensitive hplc method
(limit of determination 0.4 nmol/l; dahl er al, 1991).
concentration was plotted against time, and
concentration curves were obtained by fitting a three-
exponential equation through an iterative procedure
to each measurement, using the computer program
kaleidagraph’ 3.0 (abelbeck software, usa).

pet experiments and calculations

pet experiments were performed using the radioli-
gand [''c}raclopride, which was prepared as previ-
ously described (halldin er a/., 1991). after an intrave-
nous bolus injection of the radioligand, radioactivity
in brain tissue was measured with the pet camera
system scanditronix pc2048-[5b for 51 min. the reso-
lution of the pet camera system is 4.5 mm. a head
fixation device was used to reproduce the head posi-
tion. regions of interest were drawn manually on the
reconstructed pet images. the putamen was drawn
bitlaterally in two adjacent sections, covering the level
of the foramen of monro. data from the four puta-
men regions were pooled before calculation of re-
gional radioactivity. the cerebellar region was drawn
d, receptor occupancy and  xxxd3568xxx  acetate

in one section. the regions were drawn at the baseline
experiment images and then transferred to the experi-
ments after administration of zpta. to obtain
uptake curves, regional radioactivity was calculated
for each scan, corrected for decay and plotted vs time.
for further details on experimental procedure and ana-
lytical approaches, see farde er al. (1989a, 1992). the
calculation of d, receptor occupancy was based on
the ratio between the radioactivity concentration in
the putamen and the cerebellum, which was used as a
reference region. d, receptor occupancy was defined
as the percentage reduction in the putamen to cere-
bellum ratio (r) after administration of zpta
compared with the baseline condition in the same
subject.

according to the law of mass action, the relation
between receptor binding and the concentration of
ligand at equilibrium is described by the hyperbolic
(curvilinear) function

k,+f

where b is the concentration of ligand, ie. zuclopen-
thixol, bound to receptors, b,,,, is the total number of
available receptors, k, is the apparent equilibrium dis-
sociation constant and f the concentration of free
(unbound) ligand (farde ef al., 1989a). assuming a
linear relationship between  xxxd3568xxx  in brain
and plasma and a constant free fraction in plasma,
and given linear pharmacokinetics (aaes-jorgensen
et al, 1981, 1983), f may be substituted with the

procedure to the nine experimental data points
(observations for the three subjects at 2, 7 and 31 h).
the fitted curve was extrapolated beyond the data

pharmacodynamics

there were no marked subjective or observable effects
in any subject. none of the subjects had extra-
pyramidal symptoms (eps) or akathisia. there was
no unequivocal observable drowsiness or sedation.
on the subjective vas ratings, all three subjects re-
ported sedation during the first day. the sedation was
of moderate intensity in two subjects and slight inten-
sity in one subject, and most pronounced after 4-6 h.
one (subject c) reported episodes of “unusual, pro-
nounced emotional discomfort’ at 12 and 36h.

‘the reaction time measurements (rt 1-3) were plot-
ted against time. the simple reaction time (rt1) is
presented in fig. 3. all three tests yielded similar re-
sults in both experiment and control groups. there
was a large within-subject variation in both groups.
the minimal and maximal individual ranges of reac-
tion times in the three tasks were 54-133 ms for rt1,
66-138 ms for rt2 and 78-267 ms for rt3, with no
apparent difference between medicated subjects and
controls.

discussion

central d, receptor occupancy was measured  re-
peatedly after injection of  xxxd3568xxx  acetate in
healthy subjects. this study design would not have
been feasible in those severely psychotic patients
where injections of antipsychotic drugs are motivated.
healthy subjects were chosen to permit baseline
control pet examinations and reaction time tests,
and to allow to repeat the experiments after drug ad-
ministration according to a strict time schedule. one
primary issue is whether results from healthy subjects
can be applied to schizophrenic patients. we have pre-
viously shown that there is no difference in
[''c]raclopride binding to d, receptors in the puta-
men in healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients
(farde ez al., 1990). therefore, d, receptor occupancy
determined in healthy subjects should be predictable
for that in schizophrenic patients. another related
issue 1s whether the calculated receptor occupancy
can be extrapolated to a larger population. in the
present experimental design inter-subject variability
in anatomy and receptor numbers was controlled for
with the use of each subject as their own control and
individually drawn regions of interest.

clinical treatment with all currently used chemical
classes of classical neuroleptics induces a uniformly
high (70-85%) degree of central d, dopamine recep-
tor occupancy (farde er al/., 1992). although the stri-
atal d, receptors may not be the primary site of
action of antipsychotics, we have found quantitative
relations between the degree of striatal d, receptor

occupancy and clinical effects. thus, a statistically sig-
nificant relation between antipsychotic effect and d,
receptor occupancy was recently shown in a con-
trolled study (nordstrom et al, 1993). in another
study, the risk of eps was significantly increased in
patients with occupancy above 80% (farde er al.,
1992). we have proposed that there is a threshold
for antipsychotic effect at about 70% d, receptor
occupancy, and a distinct threshold eps at about
80%, suggesting that 70-80% may be the optimal thera-
peutic interval for d, receptor occupancy.

d, receptor occupancy was plotted vs plasma con-
centrations of  xxxd3568xxx , and the curvilinear func-
tion of equation (2) fitted well to the data (r = 0.95;
fig. 2). the good relation between plasma con-
centration and receptor occupancy suggests that the
fraction of  xxxd3568xxx  not bound to plasma pro-
teins was similar among the three subjects. such a
curvilinear relation has previously been shown for
sulpiride (farde ez al., 1988), haloperidol (wolkin er
al., 1989; nyberg et al., 1995), and for raclopride in
antipsychotic doses (nordstrom et al, 1993). the
curve was extrapolated to the higher plasma concentra-
tions reported after clinical doses of  xxxd3568xxx 
via different routes of administration (fig. 2; aaes-
jorgensen et al., 1981; amdisen et al., 1986, 1987:
aaes-jergensen, 1989). despite the present low dose
of  xxxd3568xxx , a high degree of d, receptor occu-
pancy (51%, 71%, 75%) was established already
within the first 7 h. the extrapolated dose-response
curve indicates that administration of zpta in clini-
cal doses of 50-150 mg can be expected to rapidly
induce a very high d, receptor occupancy (90-95%).
to predict the occupancy time course with an esti-
mated half-life of 24 h and 7,,,, at 24 h, the present
apparent k, and plasma concentrations were entered
into equation (2). thus the d, receptor occupancy
should exceed 70% for 3-5 days after administration
of 50-150 mg zpta. our findings support the view
that the antipsychotic effects of a single injection of
zpta may last for several days, thus reducing the
need for frequently repeated injections (baastrup et
al., 1993). however, increments in dosage above 50
mg should only affect d, receptor occupancy marginal-
ly, and the induced receptor occupancy should consid-
erably exceed the 70% required for antipsychotic
effect alone.

our previous studies indicate an increased risk for
eps at high levels of d, receptor occupancy. con-
trolled studies on conventional antipsychotic drugs
have failed to demonstrate therapeutic gains with very
high doses (aubree and lader, 1980: baldessarini
et al., 1988). a “bell-shaped” dose-effect relationship
has even been suggested where higher doses, above

international clinical psychopharmacology . vol 10.1995 225
the equivalent of about 20 mg/day haloperidol, would
reduce therapeutic efficacy (baldessarini er al., 1988).
in addition, high doses of conventional antipsy-
chotics and rapid dose increment may increase the risk
for the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (keck e7 al.
1989). to our knowledge, controlled blind studies
with fixed doses of zpta have not been performed.
our results suggest that a single dose of 150 mg
zpta or more may be unnecessarily high, and that a
single dose of 25 mg or even less may suffice to
induce antipsychotic effect for several days in some
patients.

after 14 days the calculated d, receptor occupancy
was —3%, —10% and 10% in the three subjects. given
the test-retest reliability of the method this occu-
pancy cannot be regarded as different from baseline
(nordstrom et al, 1992). thus, there was no indica-
tion of persisting d, receptor occupancy or receptor
up-regulation.

the present open study design calls for cautious
interpretation of the pharmacodynamic effects. the
subjects were informed on the possibility of both seda-
tion and eps. despite the high d, receptor occu-
pancy during the second experimental day, there were
no eps that could be objectively verified with rating
scales. however, the report from one subject of
“unusual emotional discomfort’ was in all likelihood
drug-induced and could well be interpreted as a subjec-
tive element of akathisia or neuroleptic-induced dys-
phoria. even so, the apparent absence of eps is note-
worthy. apart from the inter-subject variability in
drug response, the short time of the study may not
have allowed for the full development of eps. our
previous report of a high risk of eps at d, receptor
occupancy above 80% was peformed in psychotic
patients after several weeks of treatment (farde et al.,
1992). in addition, it is conceivable that the interac-
tion of zuclopenthixo! with other than d, receptors
may modify the risk for eps, or the level of d, recep-
tor occupancy at which eps occurs (gerlach, 1991).

all three subjects reported sedation, as rated with
the vas scales, which was most pronounced during
the first few hours after administration of zpta. de-
spite this subjective sedation, there were no identifia-
ble effects in the reaction time paradigm. this agrees
with previous observations on cognitive and psychomo-
tor function in healthy subjects after low doses of
antipsychotic drugs (king, 1990). however, different
expectations in the treatment and control groups, and
the limited number of subjects, could have obscured
possible effects,

the suggested rationale for the use of zpta in
doses of 50-150 mg has been the combination of anti-
psychotic and sedative effects (amdisen er al, 1987:

226 international clinical psychopharmacology . vol 10. 1995

§ nyberg £7 al.

baastrup eral., 1993).  xxxd3568xxx  has marked affin-
ity both for d, and d, dopamine receptors, as well as
for 5-ht, and a-adrenergic receptors (hyttel et al,
1985). it seems likely that the sedation induced by
zpta may be mediated by interaction with a,-adrener-
gic receptors. if high doses of zpta are required to
induce sufficient sedation, the simultaneously induced
very high d, receptor occupancy may be viewed as an
unwanted consequence of the treatment, which calls
for careful assessment of acute eps.
