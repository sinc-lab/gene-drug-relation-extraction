thiazide-sensitive na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter is the major salt reabsorption pathway in the
distal convoluted tubule, which is located just after the macula densa at the beginning
of the aldosterone-sensitive nephron. this cotransporter was identified at the molecular
level in the early 1990s by the pioneering work of steven c. hebert and coworkers,
opening the molecular area, not only for the na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter but also for the
family of electroneutral cation-coupled chloride cotransporters that includes the loop
diuretic-sensitive na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺ cotransporter of the thick ascending limb of henle’s
loop. this work honoring the memory of steve hebert presents a brief review of our
current knowledge about salt and water homeostasis generated as a consequence of
cloning the cotransporter, with particular emphasis on the molecular biology, physiological properties, human disease due to decreased or increased activity of the cotransporter, and regulation of the cotransporter by a family of serine/threonine kinases
known as wnk. thus one of the legacies of steve hebert is a better understanding of
salt and water homeostasis.
distal tubule; ion transport; hypertension; diuretics

were developed in the middle of the
twentieth century and quickly became popular, since they were
the first active agents with proven beneficial effects for lowering blood pressure in patients with arterial hypertension (47,
75). fifty years later, thiazides are still recommended as the
first line of pharmacological therapy for the treatment of
hypertension (13). pioneering studies by kunau et al. (57) were
the first to suggest that thiazide-type diuretics inhibited chloride reabsorption in the distal nephron. later, studies by renfro
(85, 86) demonstrated that the urinary bladder of the teleost
winter flounder (pseudopleuronectes americanus) exhibited a
salt transport mechanism in the apical membrane that featured
an interdependence between na⫹ and cl⫺ transport, suggesting the existence of an electroneutral na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter.1
a few years later, stokes et al. (103) observed that this
transport mechanism in flounder urinary bladder was specifically inhibited by thiazide diuretics in a dose-dependent manner. this was followed by the work of costanzo (15) and
ellison et al. (31), who established that in mammalian kidney
the apical membrane of the distal convoluted tubule (dct)
possesses a similar thiazide inhibitable na⫹-cl⫺ transport
pathway, and thus dct is the site of action for thiazide type
diuretics. in the next few years, the na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter was
studied as the “thiazide receptor” by assessing the binding of
the tracer [3h] xxxd2627xxx  to plasma membranes from the renal
cortex (6, 32, 107). however, the molecular area for the renal

na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter, and the rest of the slc12 family of
electroneutral cation chloride cotransporters, began with the
pioneering work of steven hebert and coworkers, who isolated
a cdna clone encoding the thiazide-sensitive na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter (ncc) from the winter flounder urinary bladder,
following an expression cloning strategy in xenopus laevis
oocytes (35).2
after several months of unsuccessful experiments that were
designed to clone the rat outer medullary bumetanide-sensitive
na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺ cotransporter, based on the observations of
stokes et al. (103) and probably inspired by the remarkable
book of homer smith from fish to philosopher (102), steven
hebert suggested that we should pursue the expression cloning
of the thiazide-sensitive na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter from the winter flounder urinary bladder, with the idea that cloning this fish
cdna would probably be the best place to start to identify, not
only the mammalian ortholog, but also the bumetanide-sensitive na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺ cotransporters because, he said, “they probably are related.” he was right. cloning of the flounder cdna
cotransporter was quickly followed by the molecular identification of rat cdnas encoding the thiazide-sensitive na⫹-cl⫺
cotransporter, two isoforms of the bumetanide-sensitive na⫹k⫹-2cl⫺ cotransporters (24, 34), and four isoforms of the
k⫹-cl⫺ cotransporters (40, 73, 81). this is one of the many
visionary projects that steve hebert often generated.

aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron. it is divided into early and
late segments, also known as  xxxg2138xxx  and dct2, respectively.
the major salt reabsorption pathway in the dct is the thiazide-sensitive ncc (15, 31, 57, 82, 109). in  xxxg2138xxx , salt
transport is driven exclusively by ncc, whereas in dct2, the
epithelial sodium channel (enac) also participates (10, 31, 62,
63, 78, 84). the sodium gradient that drives transport from the
lumen to the interstitium is generated and maintained by the
na⫹-k⫹-atpase that is polarized to the basolateral membrane
(28). part of the potassium entering the cell at the basolateral
membrane is secreted at the luminal membrane via k⫹ channels (120) and via an apical k⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter (3). thus the
rate of na⫹-cl⫺ reabsorption determines, in part, the rate of
k⫹ secretion. in addition, ncc modulates magnesium reabsorption in parallel with sodium reabsorption, and it regulates
calcium reabsorption inversely with sodium reabsorption. the
higher the sodium reabsorption, the lower the calcium reabsorption and vice versa (15). because of its anatomical localization just after the macular densa cells, the dct is the first
part of the nephron in which the salt reabsorption rate is not
subjected to compensation by the tubuloglomerular feedback
mechanism, and thus it affects the final concentration of salt in
urine. therefore, salt reabsorption in the dct is expected to
affect extracellular fluid balance and arterial blood pressure.
molecular biology of ncc
the ncc belongs to solute carrier family 12 (slc12;
human genome organization), known as the electrically silent, cation-coupled chloride cotransporter family (36, 46). the
slc12 family of membrane transproters translocate chloride
together with na⫹ and/or k⫹ observing an stoichiometry of
1:1 (chloride:cation), and their activity is modulated by cell
volume. slc12a, the gene encoding the thiazide-sensitive
ajp-renal physiol • vol

na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter is located on chromosome 16q13 in
humans (65, 101), 19p12–14 in rat (105), and 8 in mouse (80).
in humans,  xxxg2080xxx  is a 55-kb gene containing 26 exons
(101). the ncc has been identified at the molecular level in
human (65, 101) rat (34), mouse (58), rabbit (110), and eel
kidney (17), as well as in flounder urinary bladder (35). the
ncc is a membrane protein of 1,002 to 1,028 amino acid
residues with a proposed topology featuring a central hydrophobic domain made up of 12 putative transmembrane (tm)
spanning regions. a hydrophilic loop connects tms 7 and 8
and contains two glycosylation sites. the hydrophobic domain
is flanked by a short amino-terminal domain and a long
carboxy-terminal domain that are located within the cell. soon
after the molecular identification of ncc, anti-ncc polyclonal
antibodies were generated and used to demonstrate that this
cotransporter is specifically expressed in the apical membrane
of the dct of the kidney (4, 82). the degree of identity among
mammalian nccs is ⬃90% and that of any mammalian ncc
with the flounder ncc is ⬃60%. two putative ncc genes
from eel have been reported, and interestingly, the degree of
identity shared with the mammalian or flounder nccs is
⬃50% for both (17). two alternatively spliced isoforms differing in the length of the 3⬘-untranslated regions were discovered in rat (34), but no alternative splicing isoform affecting
the primary structure of ncc has been found in mammals.
rabbit and human nccs are longer than rat and mouse
orthologs due to the presence of 17–26 amino acid residues in
the carboxy-terminal domain. these extra residues in humans
are encoded by a separate exon (exon 20) that is not present in
mouse or rat. interestingly, this exon contains a putative pka
site that is not present in mouse and rat nccs.
tissue distribution analysis by northern blot in the rat
revealed renal-specific expression of ncc (34). however,

thiazide-sensitive na⫹-cl⫺ cotransporter

f840

recent studies have clearly demonstrated ncc protein expression in intestine (5) and bone (30) tissues. although ncc has
been postulated to exist in brain (25), blood vessels (14),
pancreas (7), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (2), gallbladder (16), and heart (29), confirmation of its presence in these
tissues at the molecular level has been unsuccessful. the role
of ncc in the intestine is not clear, but it is probably related to
salt and calcium absorption. it has been shown in many clinical
studies that the use of thiazide diuretics in elderly subjects
promotes an increase in bone mineral density and helps to
prevent pathological fractures (49, 98). consistent with this
beneficial effect of thiazides, ncc is expressed in rat and
human bones. addition of thiazides to osteoblasts in culture
increases the formation of mineralized nodules, an effect that
was no longer present after decreasing ncc expression by
transfecting cells with a ncc antisense plasmid (30).
the ncc is able to form dimers, and it is likely that it
functions as a dimer (19). the ncc is glycosylated at two sites
(n404 and n424) located in the long extracellular loop (48).
elimination of each site reduced the rat ncc activity by 50%,
and elimination of both sites reduced it by 95%. decreased
expression in the plasma membrane accounts for most of the
reduction in ncc activity. thus the glycosylated loop between
tm 7 and 8 must be oriented toward the extracellular space,
and glycosylation of ncc plays a key role in trafficking the
protein to the cell surface. interestingly, absence of glycosylation in the rat ncc (48), but not in the flounder ncc (70), is
associated with increased affinity for thiazides, suggesting that
in rat sugar moieties on ncc probably prevent thiazide from
reaching its binding site on the cotransporter.
functional properties of ncc
robust and reproducible expression of the flounder, rat,
mouse, and human nccs has been achieved by several groups
using the heterologous expression system of x. laevis oocytes
(18, 34, 35, 42, 58, 69, 93). only two groups (20, 88) have
reported some degree of functional ncc expression by transfecting human ncc cdna into mdck or hek-293 cells,
respectively. these systems turned out to be better tools for
studying ncc at the biochemical level rather than at the
functional level because robust expression of ncc was observed by western blot analysis; although protein expression
was significant, at the functional level, ncc expression was
low and not high enough to analyze ncc functional properties
or regulation. thus all our current knowledge on ncc function
comes from studies in x. laevis oocytes. as shown in table 1,
a number of interesting differences in functional properties
between the fish and mammalian nccs have been observed.
the apparent km values for na⫹ and cl⫺ in rat (69) or mouse
ncc proteins (93) are significantly lower than the km values

observed in the flounder ncc (108). ncc activity is specifically inhibited by thiazide type diuretics, with the following
potency profile:  xxxd2983xxx  ⬎  xxxd2627xxx  ⬎  xxxd299xxx  ⬎  xxxd3425xxx  ⬎  xxxd1680xxx . in all cases,
the flounder ncc exhibited lower affinity for each thiazide.
while a 100-␮m concentration of the less potent thiazides
 xxxd3425xxx  and  xxxd1680xxx  inhibited the rat ncc
by ⬎95% (69), the flounder ncc activity was reduced by only
68 and 46%, respectively (108).
differences in functional properties between the rat and
flounder nccs have been exploited to design and analyze
chimeric and site-directed mutagenesis approaches to gain
insight into ncc structure-function relationships (70). observations in this study revealed that the functional characteristics
of ncc are defined by the central hydrophobic domain, and it
was possible to define different segments within the central
domain defining cl⫺ or thiazide affinity (fig. 2). chimeras in
which the tm segment 1–7 was interchanged between flounder
and rat demonstrated that affinity-defining residues for cl⫺ are
located within this segment. in contrast, the affinity-defining
residues for thiazide inhibition are located within tm segments
8 –12. this information argued against a previous proposal that
thiazide diuretics and chloride compete for the same binding
site (107). the observation that cl⫺ affinity is defined by
residues located within tm segments 1–7 is supported by
another study from moreno et al. (71) in which the functional
consequences of a single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) that
change a single residue within ncc were analyzed. it was
observed that a highly conserved glycine within tm 4 plays a
critical role in defining the level of cotransporter activity and
the affinity for cl⫺. accordingly, a glycine to alanine snp at
position 264 resulted in a 50% decrease in cotransporter
activity associated with an increased affinity for cl⫺ of one
order of magnitude. this observation has been translated to
pharmacogenomics because it was later observed that people
harboring the g264a snp exhibit a stronger diuretic response
to the loop diuretic furosemide (112). because of the decreased
activity of ncc harboring the g264a polymorphism, it is
possible that the dct cannot increase salt reabsorption in
response to increased salt delivery that follows furosemide
administration, thus increasing the natriuretic response to the
loop diuretic. finally, little is known about residues or domains
defining specificity for ion transport or thiazide inhibition.
chimeric constructs between ncc and the apical bumetanidesensitive na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺ cotransporter  xxxg2078xxx  suggest that the
key residues must be within the central hydrophobic domain
because the amino and carboxy terminals play no role in this
issue (106).
ncc and human disease
inactivating mutations of the  xxxg2080xxx  gene encoding ncc
are the cause of gitelman’s disease, an inherited autosomal
recessive disease featuring hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis,
arterial hypotension, hypocalciuria, and hypomagenesemia that
are not usually recognized until the second decade of life. more
than 70 families have been studied and more than 100 different
mutations of ncc have been reported (http://archive.uwcm.
ac.uk/uwcm/mg; ref. 36). functional and biochemical analysis
of human or rat nccs containing some of the reported point
mutations revealed two major groups: one in which ncc

mutants cannot be glycosylated and are not functional and
another in which ncc proteins can be glycosylated and retain
a certain level of activity but which have a lower level of
activity than the wild-type ncc. (18, 58, 93).
gordon’s disease, pseudohypoaldosteronism type ii (phaii), or
familial hypertension with hyperkalemia are the terms that
have been assigned over the years for a rare inherited illness
featuring arterial hypertension with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, despite a normal glomerular filtration rate (43,
66). three loci for phaii have been observed in humans in the
following regions: 1q31-42 (64), 12p13 (26), and 17p11-q21
(64). linkage for these loci has been excluded in at least two
unrelated kindreds with autosomal dominant phaii, indicating
there is a fourth locus involved (27). the gene responsible for
this condition in families with gordon’s disease linked to
chromosome 1 remains a mystery, but in chromosomes 12 and
17, phaii cosegregates with mutations in two serine/threonine
kinases known as wnk1 and wnk4, respectively (116).
intronic deletions in the first intron of wnk1 lead to an
increased expression of a normal wnk1 protein, whereas
missense mutations in a conserved acidic region of wnk4 are
responsible for the disease. most of the pathophysiology of
phaii seems to be explained by the effects of wnks upon
distal nephron ion transport proteins, particularly the ncc.
thus the rest of the present work is devoted to an analysis of
the regulation of ncc (and other distal nephron transport
proteins) by wnks and the implication of this new knowledge
in our understanding of distal nephron physiology.
effects of wnk4 on ncc
the wnk family of serine/threonine kinases is composed of
four genes known as wnk1 to wnk4, which are located on
human chromosomes 12, 9, x, and 17, respectively (53). these
kinases exhibit a conserved  xxxg1377xxx  domain
that lacks the typical catalytic lysine in subdomain ii [hence,
the name wnk; with no lysine (k); ref. 118] flanked by an
unconserved short amino-terminal domain and a long carboxyterminal domain. the carboxy-terminal domain varies in size
and contains an autoinhibitory domain, two coiled-coil domains, and a highly conserved acidic region of 10 residues in
which most of the wnk4-phaii-type missense mutations
occur. wnk1, wnk3, and wnk4 are expressed in several
tissues, including chloride absorbing or secreting epithelia (22,
50, 52, 89, 116, 118). in the nephron, wnk1 transcripts and
wnk3 proteins have been shown to be expressed in all
nephron segments (76, 89), whereas wnk4 is present mainly
in the aldosterone-sensitive nephron (76, 116).
ajp-renal physiol • vol

f841

the discovery that phaii is due to mutations in wnk1 and
wnk4 (116) suggested that wnks are potential regulators of
ion transport in the kidney, particularly through the regulation
of ncc. first, phaii patients feature a clinical condition that
mirrors gitelman’s syndrome in which ncc is not functional
(101). second, clinical studies (44, 66) have shown that phaii
patients are particularly sensitive to very low doses of thiazide
diuretics, as 20% of the typical “thiazide” dose is sufficient to
improve hypertension and the other clinical features. third, the
expression of both wnk1 and wnk4 proteins were specifically localized to the dct (116). thus using x. laevis oocytes,
we learned that wild-type wnk4 reduces the activity of ncc,
whereas wnk4 mutants lacking catalytic activity (obtained by
introducing a d318a mutation in kinase domain of wnk4) or
harboring the phaii-type mutation e562k no longer inhibit
ncc (117). the reduction in ncc activity by wnk4 was at
least in part due to a decrease in the number of nccs present
at the cell surface. these observations were corroborated by
other groups also using x. laevis oocytes (42, 122) or epithelial
cells (9) in which ncc expression at the cell surface was
assessed by confocal image techniques. thus the proposed
pathophysiological mechanism of phaii is that wnk4 is a
natural inhibitor of ncc and that this effect is lost through
phaii-type mutations in wnk4, increasing the activity of
ncc, resulting in hypertension, hyperkalemia, and metabolic
acidosis.
the hypothesis described above has been confirmed in vivo
by two groups using different strategies in transgenic animals.
yang et al. (126) produced a knockin wnk4d561a/⫹ that
imitates the genetics of phaii because this mouse model has
one normal and one mutated wnk4 allele. the mice developed the phaii phenotype that was corrected by thiazide
administration and exhibited increased expression of phosphorylated ncc at ser-71, which together with threonines 53 and
58 were previously shown to be required for full activation of
ncc by intracellular chloride depletion (79), and phosphorylation of the ste-20 serine/threonine kinases spak/osr1 that
have been proposed to lie downstream of wnk1 and wnk4
(38, 72, 111). additionally, it was demonstrated that activation
of ncc by intracellular chloride depletion requires nccspak/osr1 interaction and that in this condition spak/
osr1 induces phosphorylation of human ncc at threonine
residues 45, 55, and 60 and serine 91 (87, 88), corresponding
to threonines 43, 53, and 58, and serine 89 in rat ncc (79).
lalioti et al. (59) produced bac transgenic mice with four
alleles of wild-type wnk4 (wnk4⫹/⫹/⫹/⫹) and phaii-type
mutant mice with two alleles of wild-type wnk4 and two of
mutant wnk4 (wnk4phaii). thus in addition of the two
normal alleles of wnk4, these mice exhibit two extra alleles
of wild-type or mutant wnk4. wnk4⫹/⫹/⫹/⫹ mice developed
a gitelman’s-like condition, with hypoplasia and hypotrophy
of the dct, indicating that, as suggested by in vitro studies
(117, 122), wild-type wnk4 indeed inhibits ncc. in contrast,
wnk4phaii mice developed a clear phaii-like phenotype,
with arterial hypertension and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of
the dct. when exposed to a high potassium diet, wnk4phaii
mice actually died due to hyperkalemia. a very intriguing
observation was that crossing wnk4phaii mice with ncc null
mice (99) fully prevented the phenotype, including the hyperkalemia during high potassium diet, unmasking the importance

of ncc activity, not only in blood pressure regulation but also
in potassium and hydrogen regulation in the collecting duct.
the mechanism by which wnk4 modulates the activity of
ncc is not fully understood. wild-type wnk4 induces a
decrease in ncc expression in the plasma membrane in both
oocytes (42, 117, 122) and wnk4-ncc-transfected cos-7
cells (9). in these studies, decreased expression of ncc in
plasma membrane was not observed with a wnk4-harboring
phaii-type mutant. in addition, in transgenic mice mimicking
phaii, mutant wnk4 is associated with increased expression
of ncc in dct apical membrane (59, 126). the effect of
wild-type wnk4 is not prevented by wild-type or mutant
dynamin, suggesting that clathrin-induced vesicle internalization is not involved. treatment of cos-7 cells with  xxxd279xxx 
a1, an inhibitor of the vacuolar-type h⫹-atpas,e partially
reduced the wnk4-induced decrease in ncc expression, suggesting that at least part of the reduction of ncc expression is
due to increased degradation of the cotransporter in lysosomal
compartment (9).
modulation of distal nephron ion transport systems
by wnk4
the clinical features of phaii suggested that, in addition to
ncc, other renal ion transport systems of the distal nephron
could be regulated by wnks. thus effects of wnk4 on these
transport systems have been extensively studied over the last
few years (for review see refs. 37, 54, 94). the results
obtained (table 2) using wild-type wnk4, phaii-type
wnk4, and a constitutively phosphorylated wnk4 in a canonical site for the serum glucocorticoid kinase (sgk; wnk4s1169d) positioned wnk4 as a potential switch that can work
in different functional states to modulate distal renal activity
from a basal state to one that either maximizes salt reabsorption
or maximizes k⫹ secretion. these functional states of wnk4
may help explain how the kidney achieves the balance between
renal salt reabsorption and potassium secretion, which occurs
even though both are stimulated by aldosterone, a steroidal
hormone that is released from the adrenal glands under two
different physiological conditions: intravascular volume depletion and hyperkalemia. in the former, aldosterone promotes
maximal renal salt reabsorption to preserve and restore intravascular volume, whereas in the latter, renal k⫹ secretion is
maximized.
table 2 shows the effects of different types of wnk4 upon
ion transport systems of the distal nephron. in addition to the
effects discussed above on ncc, wild-type wnk4 is a negative regulator of the apical  xxxg1232xxx   xxxg1249xxx  (45, 55,
60). however, unlike the regulation of ncc, wnk4 catalytic

activity is not required for the regulation of  xxxg1249xxx , and
phaii-type mutations in wnk4 result in further inhibition of
 xxxg1249xxx . in contrast, wnk4-s1169d no longer inhibits  xxxg1249xxx 
(91). wild-type wnk4 reduces the activity of enac in a
kinase-independent fashion, but like ncc and unlike  xxxg1249xxx ,
phaii-type mutations in wnk4 prevent the inhibitory effect
of wnk4 on enac (90). additionally, wnk4-s1169d also
loses its inhibitory effect on enac (91). other important
targets for wnk4 are the claudins, which are believed to
mediate paracellular cl⫺ flux in the distal nephron. two
independent groups (51, 121) observed that in mdckii cells
wild-type wnk4 increases the paracellular transport to cl⫺.
this effect requires wnk4 catalytic activity and is associated
with phosphorylation of claudin-4 in its carboxy-terminal domain. similar to their effects on  xxxg1249xxx , phaii-type mutations
in wnk4 are associated with further increases in cl⫺ permeability and phosphorylation of claudin-4. the effect of wnk4s1169d on paracellular chloride permeability or claudin phosphorylation has not been addressed. finally, wild-type wnk4
also inhibits the activity of the k⫹-cl⫺ cotransporters by a
mechanism that requires catalytic activity (39). kccs in the
distal nephron are critical for potassium secretion in the dct
(3) and acid secretion in the collecting duct (8). thus phaiitype mutations in wnk4 behave as “loss of function” mutations toward ncc and enac but as “gain of function” mutations toward  xxxg1249xxx  and claudins, causing confusion about
whether phaii is a gain or loss of function type of inherited
disease.
as presented in table 2, it is evident that wnk4 can
perform in at least three different functional states. one is the
wild-type wnk4 that reduces the activities of ncc, enac,
and  xxxg1249xxx  and stimulates claudins. therefore, salt reabsorption in the dct by ncc is partial, and some of the sodium
delivered to the connecting tubule (cnt) is interchanged with
potassium by simultaneous operation of the enac and  xxxg1249xxx 
channels, whereas some is reabsorbed by enac with chloride
passing through the parecellular space. from here, wnk4 can
move toward two different functional states. one is obtained
by constitutive phosphorylation of the canonical site for sgk
s1169, which is one of the well-known mechanisms for aldosterone action because this hormone stimulates sgk (100). as
shown in the interactive supplemental fig. 1, the consequences
of wnk4-s1169d resemble what would be expected to occur
during hyperkalemia when aldosterone is increases (supplemental data for this article are available online at the am j
physiol renal physiol website). the consequences of s1169
phosphorylation on wnk4 are that enac and  xxxg1249xxx  activities are increased (91). it is known, for example, that these
channel activities are modulated by sgk (11, 127). in contrast,
ncc activity remains suppressed because wnk4-s1169d
inhibits ncc similarly to wild-type wnk4 (95). thus salt
escapes reabsorption in  xxxg2138xxx , and sodium delivered to dct2
and cnt is interchanged with potassium due to increased
enac and  xxxg1249xxx  activities. the combination of these effects
maximizes potassium secretion without increasing salt reabsorption. in contrast, as explained in the interactive supplemental fig. 2, the consequence of phaii-type mutations in wnk4
resembles what would be expected to occur during intravascular volume depletion. the activities of ncc, enac, and
paracellular chloride transport are increased by wnk4-phaii,
whereas the activity of  xxxg1249xxx  is further reduced. thus  xxxg2138xxx

thiazide-sensitive na -cl cotransporter

salt reabsorption is increased with the consequent reduction in
salt delivery to dct2 or the cnt, even though the salt that
reaches the cnt is reabsorbed due to increased enac and
claudin activities. because transcellular sodium reabsorption is
accompanied by paracelluar chloride transport, the luminal
negative potential that is required for potassium secretion is not
generated, and additionally,  xxxg1249xxx  is further inhibited by
wnk4-phaii. thus salt reabsorption is maximized without
increasing potassium secretion. these observations suggest
that the phaii mutations mimic a natural state resulting from
volume depletion. the next question to pursue addresses what
the upstream regulatory signal for this natural state might be.
since the hallmark of intravascular volume depletion is the
increase in the peptide hormone ang ii circulating levels,
which are not increased during hyperkalemia, signaling of
ang ii through its g-protein-coupled receptor  xxxg100xxx  is an
attractive candidate to be the physiological counterpart of the
functional state generated by phaii mutations in wnk4.
supporting this hypothesis, reconstitution experiments in xenopus oocytes have recently demonstrated that ang ii signaling acts through wnk4 and the kinase spak to increase ncc
activity (95). ang ii increases ncc activity only in the
presence of wnk4, and this effect is completely prevented by
the  xxxg100xxx  blocker losartan. in addition, wnk4-phaii that no
longer inhibits ncc also exhibited no response to ang ii,
providing evidence that the ang ii effect can be substituted in
full by phaii mutations in wnk4. conversely, ang ii
signaling did not reverse wnk4 inhibition of  xxxg1249xxx . interestingly, it was also observed that ang ii signaling increased
phosphorylation at key regulatory sites in both spak and ncc
in mammalian cells. several studies (33, 72, 83, 87, 88, 111)
have suggested that wnks lie upstream of spak, which
probably phosphorylates the cotransporters. these findings
place wnk4-spak in the signaling pathway between ang ii
and ncc and reveal a key role for the ang ii-wnk4-spakncc pathway in the renal response to intravascular volume
depletion. supporting these observations, experiments in vivo
have shown that ang ii promotes the trafficking of ncc to
the apical membrane of dct cells (97) and has an inhibitory
effect on  xxxg1249xxx  activity (115). additionally, a recent genomic
wide association study analysis in the amish population
showed a strong association signal between blood pressure
levels and common variants within the spak gene (114).
taking all this information together, our current understanding
of the wnk4 modulation of ncc activity is as follows (fig. 3).
during normovolemia (fig. 3a), in which the renin-ang
system is suppressed, wnk4 behaves as a natural inhibitor of
ncc, reducing its activity by decreasing the number of nccs
present in the plasma membrane (9, 97, 117). although a
protein-protein interaction between wnk4 and ncc has been
observed in oocytes (117) and in mice (59), at this point it is
not clear whether the negative effect of wnk4 on ncc is
direct. during hypovolemia (fig. 3b), when the renin-ang
system is activated, ang ii interacts with its  xxxg100xxx , turning
wnk4 into an activator of ncc by increasing ncc trafficking
to the plasma membrane, and this is likely mediated through
spak (88, 95). supporting this proposal, eating a low-salt diet
is associated with phosphorylation of spak and ncc (12) in
similar phosphoaceptor sites to those phosphorylated after
exposing oocytes to ang ii (95). the model shown in fig. 3
depicts the location of  xxxg100xxx  at the basolateral membrane.

however, renin and ang-converting enzymes have been localized within the distal nephron (56, 92), and apical  xxxg100xxx  was
shown to be present in the collecting duct (115), introducing
the possibility that ang ii present in the distal tubular fluid
may have an effect on distal tubule transport. according to our
observations, patients with phaii (fig. 3c) have one allele
with mutations that imitate the effect of ang ii. thus there is
a constitutive activation of spak and nccs, abnormally

increasing salt reabsorption and decreasing potassium secretion, hence, producing arterial hypertension with hyperkalemia. consistent with this proposal, the phaii-type knockin
mouse exhibits increased phosphorylation of spak and ncc
in the kidney (126). these proposals imply that phaii is a
“gain of function” type of disease, which agrees with its
dominant mode of inheritance. the gain of function is to make
wnk4-spak-ncc behave as if there was a continuous activation of  xxxg100xxx  in the dct.
modulation of ncc activity by other wnks
the effect of wnk1 upon ncc and upon the rest of the ion
transport systems in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron is
complex and still unclear. two isoforms of wnk1 are expressed in the kidney (23, 77): the complete long wnk1
(l-wnk1) and a shorter transcript that results from alternative
splicing of exons 1- 4 (ks-wnk1 that lacks the first 437
amino acid residues, including the entire kinase domain). the
l-wnk1 transcript isoform is expressed along the entire
nephron, whereas ks-wnk1 transcripts are only present in the
dct and the cnt (76). wnk1 seems to be a key regulator of
other wnks, either by phosphorylation processes (61) or by
direct interactions at the protein level (123, 125). for instance,
there is no evidence so far that wnk1 has a direct effect on
ncc. nevertheless, since ncc expression in mammalian cells
has not been properly achieved, it is not known if the absence
of wnk1 effects on ncc using oocytes as the expression
system can be extended to mammalian cells. in this regard,
yang et al. (122) observed in oocytes that wnk1 prevents the
wnk4-induced inhibition of ncc. that is, in the presence of
wnk1, wnk4 no longer inhibits ncc. this interaction is
modulated by the alternatively spliced ks-wnk1 isoform
because ks-wnk1, by interacting with l-wnk1 in a dominant negative fashion, eliminates the l-wnk1-induced inhibition of wnk4 (104). thus it has been proposed that in
normal subjects ks-wnk1, by high-jacking l-wnk1, prevents its inhibitory effect upon wnk4, allowing wnk4 to
inhibit ncc. in contrast, in phaii patients, the ks-wnk1to-l-wnk1 ratio is reduced due to intronic deletions of the
wnk1 gene that increase the expression of l-wnk1. as a
consequence, l-wnk1 is able to inhibit wnk4 and thus ncc
activity is increased, augmenting salt reabsorption in the dct
and thus arterial pressure. consistent with these observations,
ks-wnk1 and l-wnk1 also interact with each other to
regulate  xxxg1249xxx  activity. l-wnk1 decreases  xxxg1249xxx  activity,
an effect that requires catalytic activity and that is prevented by
ks-wnk1 (60, 113). l-wnk1 is also a modulator of the
enac via sgk (119). wnk1 induces the phosphorylation of
sgk, which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits a protein
named nedd4 that is known to reduce enac activity by
promoting its endocytosis via a clathrin-dependent mechanism
(1). in addition, in mouse cortical collecting duct cells in
culture aldosterone seems to modulate the l-wnk1-to-kswnk1 ratio of expression (74). therefore, enac activity is
enhanced. the increased expression of l-wnk1 in the dct of
a mouse model carrying a deletion of wnk1 intron 1 has been
confirmed (22). however, increased expression of ks-wnk1
in dct was also observed in the same study. thus the
molecular mechanism for wnk1-induced ncc activity in
ajp-renal physiol • vol

phaii patients with wnk1 intron 1 deletion remains unknown.
wnk3, a member of the wnk family not associated with
phaii, is a powerful regulator of all the members of the
slc12 family and is expressed along the entire nephron, as
well as in several epithelial and nonepithelial cells outside the
kidney (53, 94). wnk3 is an activator of the na⫹-driven
cotransporters  xxxg2079xxx /2 and ncc and is also an inhibitor of
the k⫹-driven cotransporters  xxxg2081xxx - xxxg2084xxx  (21, 52, 89). that
is, wnk3 activates chloride influx pathways and inactivates
chloride efflux pathways. since the movements of sodium into
and potassium out of the cell are quickly resorted by the
na⫹-k⫹-atpase, what wnk3 seems to promote is the net
chloride movement into the cells. activation by wnk3 is
associated with phosphorylation of two amino-terminal domain threonines in  xxxg2079xxx  and  xxxg2078xxx  (52, 89). because
threonines that are conserved in both ncc and the  xxxg2079xxx /2
are phosphorylated by similar stimuli, such as intracellular
chloride depletion (72, 79, 88), it is highly likely that these
threonines in ncc also become phosphorylated by wnk3.
wnk3 activation of ncc is associated with increased numbers of ncc on the cell surface, suggesting that wnk3
promotes the insertion of ncc vesicles into the plasma membrane (89). the wnk3-induced activation of  xxxg2079xxx /2s or
inhibition of kccs occurs in oocytes even during cell swelling,
which is a well-known inhibitor of  xxxg2079xxx /2 and ncc activities (34, 41, 69). interestingly, elimination of wnk3 catalytic
activity by the d294a substitution in the kinase domain
(wnk3-d294a) not only prevented the wnk3-induced activation of  xxxg2079xxx /2 and ncc and its inhibition of kccs but
also turned wnk3 into a powerful inhibitor of  xxxg2079xxx /2 and
ncc and an activator of kccs, even in isotonic or hypertonic
conditions, inducing cell shrinkage, which is known to activate
 xxxg2079xxx /2 and inhibit kccs. for example, microinjection of
crna encoding the k⫹-cl⫺ cotransporters  xxxg2081xxx ,  xxxg2083xxx , or
 xxxg2084xxx  induces expression of these cotransporters that can be
demonstrated by assessing the cl⫺-dependent 86rb⫹ influx but
only when oocytes are exposed to a hypotonic medium to
induce cell swelling. when incubated in isotonic medium, the
cotransporters are completely inactive (67, 68). in contrast,
when coinjected with wnk3-d294a crna, kccs are fully
active when incubated in isotonic medium (21). thus inactive
wnk3 promotes net chloride movement out of the cells. since
the activation of kccs by wnk3-d294a can be prevented
with  xxxd411xxx  and/or  xxxd1781xxx , it is likely due to a
wnk3-d294a activation of protein phosphatases 1 and 2b
(21). thus wnk3 modulates the activity not only of ncc but
also of all members of the slc12 family and, in doing so,
bypasses the changes in cell volume and/or intracellular chloride concentration that are usually required for their activation
or inhibition. for these reasons, it has been proposed that
wnk3 could be the intracellular kinase sensitive to cell volume and/or intracellular chloride concentration (53).
from observations discussed above, it is evident that wildtype wnk3 and wnk4 have opposite effects on ncc.
whereas wnk3 is an activator, wnk4 is an inhibitor. because both kinases are expressed in the dct, it is possible that
ncc activity at any given time is a result of the algebraic sum
of both effects. in this regard, yang et al. (124) performed a
series of experiments in x. laevis oocytes by coinjecting ncc
crna with different fragments of wnk3 and wnk4 crna

thiazide-sensitive na -cl cotransporter

and concluded that these kinases interact and regulate each
other by means of the carboxy-terminal domains. for instance,
although the effects of wnk3 and wnk4 on ncc require
kinase activity when full-length constructs are used (9, 42, 89,
117, 124), it was observed that wnk3 activation or wnk4
inhibition of ncc was reproduced using only the carboxyterminal domain that lacks the entire kinase domain (124).
these types of interactions were not observed with wild-type
full-length proteins or with full-length proteins harboring a
single point mutation that eliminates catalytic activity. unlike
what was proposed for l-wnk1/ks-wnk1 regulation of
ncc, there is no evidence that such truncated isoforms of
wnk3 or wnk4 are expressed in the dct. in addition, the
presence of endogenous wnk3 and wnk4 transcripts in x.
laevis oocytes (96) and the known interaction between wnks
(61, 123, 124) make these data difficult to interpret. thus, at
the moment, the physiological relevance of wnk3 and wnk4
carboxy-terminal domain fragments interactions is unclear.
several differences between wnk3 and wnk4 suggest that
each kinase could serve different purposes. the effect of
wnk4, but not of wnk3, on ncc can be modulated by ang
ii (95), suggesting that ncc activity is regulated by intravascular volume via wnk4, but not via wnk3. additionally,
wnk1, the other wnk member clearly associated with blood
pressure regulation, prevents wnk4 but not wnk3 effects on
ncc (122, 124). on the other hand, elimination of wnk4
catalytic activity abrogates wnk4 inhibition of ncc, whereas
elimination of wnk3 catalytic activity switches wnk3 from
an activator to an inhibitor. thus it is possible that wnk3 and
wnk4 respond to different upstream signals for modulation of
ncc activity, as it is possible that downstream pathways between
wnks and ncc are also different. in this regard, we have
constructed chimeric proteins between wnk3 and wnk4 by
swapping the low conserved amino- or carboxy-terminal domains
(12–15% identity) that flank the well-conserved kinase domain
(⬎80% identity). chimeras were functional and possessed catalytic activity. the chimera containing the amino-terminal domain
of wnk3 swapped into the kinase and carboxy-terminal domain
of wnk4 activated ncc in a kinase-dependent fashion. in
contrast, the chimera containing the amino-terminal domain of
wnk4 swapped into the kinase and carboxy-terminal domain of
wnk3 inhibited ncc in a kinase-dependent fashion. these
observations suggest that wnk3 and wnk4 amino-terminal
domains contain sequences defining the type of effects that they
have on ncc (96).
the understanding of ncc structure-function relationship
and its regulation by wnks and downstream kinases like
spak/osr1 have advanced quickly in the past few years, but
there is still a lot of exciting discovering waiting for us to get
there. meanwhile, this little stop in our journey was done to
recognize the invaluable contribution and legacy of steve c.
hebert. without his passion for understanding salt transport
mechanisms in the kidney, most of what is discussed in the
present work would not be possible.
