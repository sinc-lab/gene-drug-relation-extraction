abstract
this review describes how genetic diﬀerences among patients may change the therapeutic outcome in cancer chemotherapy.
severe toxicity in genetically predisposed patients is predominantly associated with mutations in drug metabolism enzyme genes, and an
update on genetic intolerance to  xxxd2573xxx , 5-ﬂuorouracil, and irinotecan is provided. moreover, recent ﬁndings pointed out
that the  xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ) c677t mutation might change patient susceptibility to the toxic eﬀects of the
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-ﬂuorouracil (cmf) regimen and  xxxd3077xxx . finally, it is emerging that not only toxicity, but also
response to chemotherapy could be inﬂuenced by pharmacogenetic determinants, and the clinical relevance of polymorphisms in  xxxg2366xxx  (ts) and glutathione-s-transferase (gst) genes is discussed. # 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
the role of pharmacogenetics in cancer chemotherapy
is progressively changing. besides the ‘‘classical’’ examples of reduced tolerance to chemotherapy, genetic
determinants might also aﬀect patients’ response and
survival. genotypic stratiﬁcation of patients might
identify subgroups with a better prognostic proﬁle. the
presence of alleles associated with reduced responsiveness to a certain drug might guide the selection of
alternative therapies.
the need for optimisation in cancer chemotherapy is
urgent. adjusting the dose by body surface area does
not correct for inter-individual diﬀerences in drug disposition. the intrinsic potency of cytotoxic agents and
their use at maximally tolerated doses render chemotherapeutic treatment a high risk procedure for those
patients that deviate from the average population.
identifying the genetic reasons behind either the occurrence of toxicity or lack of tumour response will reduce
the unpredictability of cancer treatment. this review
highlights the most recent ﬁndings on pharmacogenetic
correlations between toxicity/response and mutated
genetic traits.

pharmacogenetics
mutations in the  xxxg2319xxx 
( xxxg2319xxx ) gene have profound eﬀects on  xxxd2573xxx  ( xxxd2573xxx ) tolerance and dose intensity in maintenance
treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) in
children [3,4]. a recent trial estimated that 71% of
patients with bone marrow intolerance to  xxxd2573xxx  were
phenotypically- xxxg2319xxx  deﬁcient [5]. when 14 of these
patients were typed for open reading frame (orf)
mutations associated with  xxxg2319xxx  deﬁciency ( xxxg2319xxx *2,
 xxxg2319xxx *3a,  xxxg2319xxx *3c (table 1), 9 of them were found
to be positive, with 100% concordance in the homozygous-mutant patients. however, less concordance was
found in patients with intermediate  xxxg2319xxx  activity. 6mp dose adjustment strategy in  xxxg2319xxx -deﬁcient
patients was applied, and appropriate dose reductions

clinical phenotypes include response, downstaging, survival and toxicity. pharmacological phenotypes include in vivo and ex vivo indexes like
blood cell enzyme activity, plasma metabolic ratios and use of phenotypic probes.

these mutated  xxxg1506xxx  alleles account for the slow acetylator phenotype [2].
c
 xxxg2319xxx *2,  xxxg2319xxx *3a,  xxxg2319xxx *3c are associated with up to 95% of the  xxxg2319xxx  deﬁciency [1].
d
concerning polymorphic  xxxd2008xxx  glucuronidation, no clear pharmacodynamic correlation was found in high and low glucuronidators [57],
and no clinical phenotype is reported.
e
we are currently investigating the functional role of ugt2b7 and  xxxg2385xxx  polymorphisms for  xxxd2008xxx  and ﬂavopiridol glucuronidation,
respectively.

50% to 94%)) allowed patients to tolerate full doses of
all other chemotherapy treatments. in 8 wild-type
patients who did not tolerate standard  xxxd2573xxx  dosage,
median  xxxd2573xxx  dose reduction was 8% (from 20% to
91%), suggesting that toxicity was not caused by genetic
diﬀerences in  xxxd2573xxx  disposition. although  xxxd2573xxx  dose
intensity was reduced in homozygous mutants compared with either heterozygous or wild-type patients, no
diﬀerences in survival were observed among the genotypes. after  xxxd2573xxx  dose individualisation in tpmtdeﬁcient patients, survival outcomes are similar between
deﬁcient and wild-type patients [4,6].
although the genetic basis of  xxxg2319xxx  deﬁciency has
been elucidated,  xxxg2319xxx  activity among patients without
orf mutations (approximately 90% of individuals) is
very variable and showed familial correlation [7]. the
variable number tandem repeat (vntr) region of the
 xxxg2319xxx  promoter contains several potential binding sites
for transcription factors. in vitro evidence of an inverse
correlation between the number of repeats and  xxxg2319xxx 
activity was found [8–10]. when not only the number of
repeats, but also their diﬀerent structure was related to
 xxxg2319xxx  activity among individuals without orf mutations, individuals with one vntr*6 allele were located

at the low end of the frequency distribution curve [11].
although statistically signiﬁcant, the reduction in
enzyme activity associated with vntr*6 was approximately 15% when compared with the maximal activity,
suggesting minimal phenotypic changes induced by
vntr polymorphisms, as previously reported in ref. [12].
finally, sequencing of the entire  xxxg2319xxx  genomic
structure in japanese individuals evidenced one promoter, three 30 -untranslated region (30 -utr) and 26
intronic mutations [13], and their eﬀect on mrna
turnover and splicing mechanisms should be assessed in
functional studies.
2.2. 5-fluorouracil and  xxxg652xxx 
pharmacogenetics
 xxxg652xxx  (dpd) activity
is completely or partially deﬁcient in approximately 0.1
and 3–5% of individuals, respectively [14]. at least 350
documented cases of dpd deﬁciency and seven toxic
deaths have been reported so far (diasio, 20012). the

complex molecular basis of genetic dpd deﬁciency and
the multifactorial nature of 5-fu toxicity hamper the
application of dpd pharmacogenetics to clinical
practice. in two studies, normal dpd phenotype was
found in approximately 33 and 66% of the patients who
suﬀered from severe toxicity after 5-fu [15,16],
suggesting the presence of other determinants of toxicity
in addition to dpd genetics. moreover, at least 20
functional mutations in the  xxxg652xxx  gene have been
reported.  xxxg652xxx *2a is a splice site mutation (intron
14 g1a) resulting in the production of a truncated
mrna (frequency of 0.094) [17]. so far,  xxxg652xxx *2a
has been associated with lethal outcomes in at least
four cancer patients [17,18]. when 25 patients with
grade 3–4 toxicity were genotyped for  xxxg652xxx *2a, six of
them (24%) were  xxxg652xxx *2a carriers. another study
failed to demonstrate any association, with no
 xxxg652xxx *2a carrier among 14 cases of severe toxicity,
rather showing the presence of other variants in these
patients [19]. due to the  xxxg652xxx *2a prevalence among
patients with 5-fu severe toxicity compared with normal individuals, it has been proposed that patients
should be screened for this mutation [18]. the clinical
utility of this genetic test is minimal due to its low sensitivity and unknown speciﬁcity [20]. dpd deﬁciency is
probably a genetic disorder resulting from multiple
mutations at a single gene locus. genotyping for one
single  xxxg652xxx  mutation does not have the sensitivity to
identify high-risk patients.
2.3. irinotecan and udp-glucuronosyltransferase 1a1
pharmacogenetics
the clinical pharmacogenetics of irinotecan ( xxxd2383xxx )
is mainly focused on polymorphic glucuronidation of
sn-38, the active metabolite of  xxxd2383xxx . gilbert’s syndrome (mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia) is
mainly due to a reduced udp-glucuronosyltransferase
1a1 (ugt1a1) expression caused by a ta insertion in
the ugt1a1 promoter region resulting in the variant
allele (ta)7taa (ugt1a1*28) [21–23]. a recent prospective trial of ugt1a1 pharmacogenetics in cancer
patients receiving 300 mg/m2  xxxd2383xxx  found that the
presence of the ugt1a1*28 allele markedly altered sn38 disposition. signiﬁcantly lower sn-38g/sn-38 auc
ratios and a trend towards more severe neutropenia and
diarrhoea were found in ugt1a1*28 carriers compared
with wild-type [24]. this trial is now including patients
receiving 350 mg/m2  xxxd2383xxx  in order to evaluate the
impact of ugt1a1*28 for  xxxd2383xxx  pharmacodynamics,
and the role of other possible genetic determinants of
 xxxd2383xxx  and sn-38 disposition (cyp3a4/5, carboxylesterase, p-glycoprotein,  xxxg12xxx 
(mrp).
a minority of the gilbert’s syndrome patients do not
have promoter mutations and are heterozygotes for

641

coding missense mutations [25]. a retrospective pharmacogenetic trial evaluated the role of ugt1a1 coding
mutations for irinotecan toxicity in japanese patients.
all three c686a (p229q, ugt1a1*27) carriers experienced severe toxicity. surprisingly, no association was
found with g211a (ugt1a1*6), an allele highly prevalent among asians [26,27], and associated with
approximately 60% of the gilbert’s syndrome cases
among japanese individuals [25,28].
2.4.  xxxg1475xxx  pharmacogenetics in oncology
the occurrence of severe myelotoxicity after cmf in
a very small series of breast cancer patients was associated with a c677t change in exon 4 in the  xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ) gene [29].
this polymorphism is common, with approximately
10% of homozygous individuals (tt) in caucasian
populations (frequency of 0.05–0.54 in diﬀerent populations) [30].
 xxxg1475xxx  regulates the pool of intracellular folates
for nucleic acid and protein synthesis.  xxxg1475xxx  converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (ch2thf) to 5methyltetrahydrofolate (ch3thf), a methyl donor in
the conversion of homocysteine to methionine during
protein synthesis [31]. when alanine is substituted by
valine due to c677t, this  xxxg1475xxx  variant has in vitro
thermolability and 35% residual activity [32]. the
c677t polymorphism alters the distribution of intracellular folates, creating retention of folates committed
for purine and pyrimidine synthesis (i.e. ch2thf)
[33]. ch2thf is required as a donor of monocarbon
groups when  xxxg2366xxx  converts  xxxd1838xxx  (dump) into  xxxd3364xxx 
monophosphate ( xxxd3365xxx ). qualitatively altered distribution of intracellular folates in breast cancer
patients with a tt genotype could have increased the
bone marrow sensitivity to cmf. genetic  xxxg1475xxx 
deﬁciency increases the availability of ch2thf,
probably potentiating 5-ﬂuoro (5-f)dump inhibition
of  xxxg2366xxx  and leading to severe myelosuppression.
the clinical relevance of the c677t mutation was also
highlighted in a phase i trial of the  xxxd2383xxx / xxxd3077xxx 
combination [34]. patients with a tt genotype seemed
to be protected from  xxxd3077xxx -associated toxicities
compared with cc/ct patients.  xxxd3077xxx  is a potent
 xxxg2366xxx  (ts) inhibitor and folate analogue. high intracellular levels of ch2thf in tt patients
might have competed with  xxxd3077xxx  for its binding to
ts and  xxxg814xxx , resulting in overall
reduced cytotoxic eﬀects.
larger trials should investigate the impact of
 xxxg1475xxx  c677t genotypes on response rates in patients
receiving antifolates and ﬂuoropyrimidines.

3. pharmacogenetics of the drug response. the examples
of polymorphic  xxxg2366xxx  and glutathione-stransferase genes
3.1.  xxxg2366xxx  pharmacogenetics in colorectal cancer patients
acute induction of ts has been associated with resistance to ﬂuoropyrimidine derivatives [35,36], and
tumour ts expression is inversely related to clinical
response [37–39]. in the ts enhancer region, two, three,
four and nine copies of 28-bp tandem repeated sequences (tser*2, tser*3, tser*4, tser*9) have been
described [40–42]. ts expression was increased by 2.6fold when the triple repeat was compared with the double repeat in transient expression assays [40], and a
similar trend was observed in tumour specimens [43].
in colorectal cancer patients, the relative probability
of achieving downstaging after radiation and 5-fu
treatment was diﬀerent depending upon the tser genotype. tser*2 carriers had 3.7-fold higher probability
compared with tser*3 homozygotes [44]. in a larger
study, tser genotypes correlated with ts tumour
expression levels, response and toxicity after 5-fu in
colorectal cancer patients [45]. in liver metastases,
higher (3.6-fold) mrna levels were present in tser*3
homozygotes compared with tser*2 homozygotes.
this diﬀerence probably aﬀected the responsiveness of
the tumour to 5-fu, as response rates were 9% in
tser*3 homozygotes and 50% in tser*2 homozygotes. concerning survival rates, a trend towards
longer survival in tser*2 homozygotes was reported,
in agreement with another study [45]. grade 3 toxicities
were 3-fold less frequent in tser*3 homozygotes compared with tser*2 homozygotes [46], suggesting that
better prediction of 5-fu-related toxicity might derive
from combined genotyping of  xxxg652xxx  gene ( xxxg652xxx ) and tser functional variants.
allelic imbalance leading to loss of heterozygosity
(loh) should be taken into account when tumour
samples are genotyped. the ts gene is located on the
short arm of chromosome 18, which is deleted in
approximately 40% of colorectal cancers [47]. out of 30
tser*2/tser*3 rectal cancer patients, either one of
the two alleles was lost [48]. such a high loh rate was
not reported in another study, where only one of 23
tser*2/tser*3 tumour biopsies showed loh [45].
the search for matching expressed sequence tags by
using the blast database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/blast) led to the discovery of a 6-bp deletion in
the 30 utr of ts mrna in a caucasian population
(frequency of 0.29) [49]. the 30 end of a mrna can
contain sequences that are important for maintaining
adequate mrna stability. two 30 utr polymorphisms
were detected in normal colonic mucosa, primary
tumours and colorectal metastases. in four metastatic

tumour samples with high ts expression, no correlation
was found with 30 utr mutations [50].
3.2. glutathione-s-transferase
oncology

pharmacogenetics

in

detoxiﬁcation of xenobiotics is eﬃciently mediated by
conjugation of their nucleophilic centre with reduced
glutathione (gsh) by glutathione-s-transferase (gst)
[51,52]. high phenotypic variability might derive from
gst gene duplication (ultrarapid phenotype), deletions
(‘null’ alleles, like  xxxg989xxx *0 and  xxxg997xxx *0), and promoter/coding mutations that might increase or reduce
gst function.
the role of gst pharmacogenetics in oncology is not
fully established, and diﬀerent studies showed contradictory results. for instance, in breast cancer patients
receiving cyclophosphamide, 5-ﬂuorouracil and doxorubicin, patients homozygous for both  xxxg989xxx *0 and
 xxxg997xxx *0 had a reduced risk of recurrence and hazard
of death compared with patients carrying wild-type
alleles [53]. reduced inactivation of doxorubicin- and
cyclophosphamide-generated reactive oxygen species
might have led to increased antitumour activity and
better survival rates. on the contrary, when ovarian
cancer patients received platinum and alkylating agents,
 xxxg989xxx *0 and  xxxg997xxx *0 patients had poorer survival
rates when compared with wild-type patients [54]. in the
absence of diﬀerences in toxicity, reduced systemic drug
detoxiﬁcation in null genotype patients should have led
to better survival rates compared with wild-type, but the
opposite results were observed.
similarly, conﬂicting results were shown in two studies in all children. patients having at least two of the
‘low risk’ genotypes (i.e.  xxxg989xxx *0,  xxxg997xxx *0,  xxxg996xxx 
val105) had a 3.5-fold reduced risk of relapse compared
with patients with no ‘low risk’ genotypes [55]. however, a
previous study did not demonstrate any impact of
 xxxg989xxx *0 and  xxxg997xxx *0 alleles on survival [56]. although
diﬀerent patient selection criteria were applied, the patient
population in the study by chen and colleagues [56] is
more representative of all childhood all patients.
the clinical studies on gst pharmacogenetics are not
supported by pharmacological evidence (ex vivo or in vivo)
of altered detoxiﬁcation rates in patients carrying gst
mutations. correlative studies that might clarify the
interpretation of pharmacogenetic data on  xxxg1073xxx  include:
(1) investigation of plasma pharmacokinetics of gst
substrates and their metabolites, (2) investigation of gst
activity in blood cells, for dpd and  xxxg2319xxx  enzymes.

4. conclusions
the availability of potent and reliable genetic techniques
can change the way patients will receive chemotherapy in

the near future. with this perspective in mind, oncologists
and clinical pharmacologists should prompt the inclusion
of pharmacogenetic investigation and dna collection
into early phases of clinical drug development.
how to recognise the possible presence of a pharmacogenetic issue in cancer patients under chemotherapy
treatment? if highly variable or bimodal pharmacokinetics are observed, underlying functional mutations
should be investigated. for instance, bimodality in
plasma metabolic ratios of  xxxd2008xxx  and ﬂavopiridol
are suggestive of the presence of functional mutations in
drug metabolising enzymes [57,58] (table 1). moreover,
recurrent (even after dose reduction) or unexplainable
toxicity can be induced by genetically reduced drug
inactivation/elimination. when polymorphic genes
involved in the systemic disposition of a new agent are
identiﬁed, prospective phenotype/genotype correlation
analysis should be performed in phase i-ii clinical trials,
following the example of two recent phase i and pharmacogenetic studies [34,59].
