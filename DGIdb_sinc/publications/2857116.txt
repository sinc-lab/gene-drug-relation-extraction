summary. |8i- and |82-adrenergic receptors co-exist in the adult rat ventricle. we have employed
radioligand binding and cell purification techniques to determine the cellular origin of these
receptors. the /3-adrenergic antagonist ligand (±)-[125i]iodocyanopindolol binds to 2 x 105 receptors per purified adult rat cardiomyocyte, with a dissociation constant of 70 dm. the subtypeselective antagonists betaxolol (pi),  xxxd2991xxx  (/3i), and zinterol (&) compete for ['25i]iodocyanopindolol-binding sites on intact myocytes in monophasic manners with dissociation constants of 46,
845, and 923 nm, respectively. [ i]iodocyanopindolol binding to membranes prepared from
nonmyocyte elements of rat ventricle occurs with a dissociation constant of 43 pm and a capacity
of 88 fmol/mg membrane protein. computer analysis of competition of [125i]iodocyanopindolol
binding by betaxolol,  xxxd2991xxx , and zinterol in nonmyocyte membranes demonstrates biphasic
curves that comprise binding to both ft- and ^-receptors. these data demonstrate that purified
adult ventricular myocytes possess only f), -receptors, and that the 182-receptors found in rat
ventricle are located on nonmyocyte cell types (circ res 56:126-132, 1985)

evidence for the co-existence of ft- and /^-receptors for catecholamines in the mammalian myocardium comes from both physiological and radioligand binding studies. carlsson et al. (1972, 1977)
present evidence that the inotropic and chronotropic
responses of the cat heart to catecholamines are
differentially antagonized by subtype-specific ^-antagonists. studies in guinea pig heart lead to the
same conclusion (dreyer and offermeir, 1975). radioligand binding studies, employing heterogeneous
membranes prepared from homogenized hearts, reveal the presence of both ftreceptor subtypes in rat
(minneman et al., 1979a, 1979b), kitten (kaumann
et al., 1983) and human heart (stiles et al., 1983;
waelbroeck et al., 1983). although these data demonstrate the presence of both ft- and /32-receptors
in mammalian heart, they do not describe the distribution of ftadrenergic receptor subtypes among
different cell types within the ventricle.
in the course of our own work on the hormonal
regulation of cardiac function and metabolism, we
have wondered whether specific hormone receptors
(and, hence, distinct responses) can be assigned to
particular cell types within the heart. in particular,
we have considered whether ft- and ft-receptors
co-exist on ventricular myocytes. to approach these
questions experimentally, we have combined the
techniques of radioligand binding and cell purification. specifically, we have measured the distribution
of ftreceptor subtypes on purified cardiomyocytes
from adult rat ventricle and on the nonmyocyte
elements of ventricle by employing the subtype

nonselective /j-adrenergic antagonist (±)-[125i]iodocyanopindolol ([125i]icyp), the ft subtype-selective
antagonists, betaxolol and  xxxd2991xxx , and the /32selective antagonist, zinterol.

methods
preparation of ventricular cardiomyocytes
male sprague-dawley rats were given heparin (1500
u/kg, ip) and sodium pentobarbital (12 mg, ip), and were
killed 10 minutes later. hearts were rapidly removed and
immediately perfused with ca++-free basal medium eagle
(bme, 18°c) via the aorta to stop spontaneous beating
and to remove blood cells. hearts were trimmed of extraneous tissue including pericardium, and mounted via the
aorta in a recirculating perfusion apparatus. ventricular
myocytes were prepared by collagenase perfusion in the
absence of ca++ by a method we have previously described in detail (buxton and brunton, 1983). for experiments, purified myocytes were resuspended in bme containing cacl2 (1 mm) and bsa (0.01% wt/vol). viability
of myocytes was determined by their capacity to exclude
trypan blue (1 volume of cells plus 9 volumes of 0.3%
trypan blue). myocytes were routinely 80-90% rodshaped cells excluding trypan blue. myocytes were used
in experiments 15-20 minutes after their purification.
preparation of ventricular membranes
rat hearts were removed and handled in a manner
identical to that used to prepare myocytes, except that
enzyme perfusion was omitted. ventricles were dissected
away from atrial and valvular tissue and immediately
frozen, using wallenberger clamps precooled in liquid

nitrogen. membranes were prepared from frozen tissue as
described below.
preparation of myocyte, nonmyocyte, and liver
membranes
tissue determined to be 'nonmyocyte" in origin included tissue pieces remaining after filtration of enzymereleased myocytes, as well as cells contained in the first
supernatant from myocyte purification. microscopic examination of this material confirmed the presence of numerous small nonmuscle cells, damaged myocytes, and
collagen fibers. thus, while not devoid of myocyte membrane, this material was enriched for nonmyocyte, cell
types present in rat ventricle. both purified myocytes and
nonmyocytes were collected by centrifugation (1000 g x
2 minutes) and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. whole rat
ventricle and liver were freeze-clamped at the temperature
of liquid nitrogen. for the preparation of membranes,
frozen tissues and frozen cell pellets were powdered at
-70°c and then homogenized (50 him tris, 10 itim mgcl2,
1 mm edta, ph 7.5, 4°c) in glass-glass homogenizing
tubes (kontes) and filtered through nitex cloth (149 jtm).
membranes were collected by centrifugation (3000 g x 5
minutes) and suspended in homogenizing buffer at 1-2
mg protein/ml. protein was determined by the method of
bradford (1976).
radioligand binding assay
radioiodinated cyanopindolol was the generous gift of
dr. paul insel, and was prepared as described previously
(engle et al., 1981). binding assays were performed in
triplicate by incubating 2-3 x 103 myocytes, or 30-50 tig
of membrane suspension with 0.1 ml of [125i]icyp (2200
ci/mmol) and 0.1 ml of various /s-adrenergic antagonists
or diluent in a final volume of 1.0 ml in polypropylene
test tubes (16 x 105 mm sarstedt, washed). assays were
initiated by the addition of myocytes or membranes diluted in bme immediately prior to addition to the assay.
all tubes containing myocytes were gassed with o2/co2
(95%/5%) and capped. equilibrium binding was carried
out for 60-90 minutes at 34°c in a rotary water bath at
120 rpm. assays were terminated with the addition of 10
ml of cold (4°c) hypotonic buffer (10 mm tris, 1 mm
edja, ph 7.5). bound and free [i25i]icyp were separated
by rapid filtration over glass fiber filters (whatman gf/
c). filters were washed with an additional 10 ml of
hypotonic buffer at 4°c. radioactivity retained on filters
was determined using a gamma counter at 86% efficiency.
replicate variation was less than 5% in all experiments.
nonspecific binding for both membranes and intact myocytes was determined by [125i]icyp binding in the presence of 1 hm /-propranolol. the subtraction of nonspecific
binding from total binding yielded specific binding which
was routinely 60% for intact myocytes and 70% for membranes at 100 pm [125i]icyp.
incubation of both intact cells and membranes with
[125i]icyp resulted in the rapid appearance of specific
binding that reached equilibrium in 45 minutes and was
appropriately reversed by propranolol (1 /im). binding was
linear with increasing myocyte number or amount of
membrane protein. viability of myocytes maintained under identical conditions during binding assays remained
between 90 and 95% of starting figures.

/3-adrenergic antagonist, on ventricular myocytes and ventricular nonmyocyte and liver membranes were determined from scatchard analysis (scatchard, 1949) of saturation binding isotherms. competition curves employing
j3-subtype-specific antagonists were analyzed by means of
a computer program that performs iterative, nonlinear
regression (munson and rodbard, 1980). this program
fits the binding data to equations describing the laws of
mass action for one or two classes of binding sites and
determines whether the two-site model is statistically better than the one-site fit of the data.
the affinity (kd) of the nonselective antagonist radioligand [125i]icyp was determined separately in each competition experiment with subtype-selective antagonists
and either intact myocytes or membranes, and was entered
in the computer analysis as a constant. computer-generated fits of competition data provide estimates of the
affinity constant (ki) of subtype-specific antagonists and
of the concentration of each receptor subtype. further,
computer analysis determined nonspecific binding from
data obtained at high competitor concentrations which
was indistinguishable from simultaneous measurements
of binding in the presence of 1.0 fim /-propranolol. the
likelihood that more than one receptor subtype was present was decided by comparison of the residual variances
obtained, assuming either one or two classes of binding
sites (munson and rodbard, 1980). the limitation of this
computer method to detect small numbers of /82-receptors
on the ventricular myocyte derives from both precise
measurements of binding at a given antagonist concentration (replicate variation <5%) and a large difference in the
affinities (ki) of subtype-selective agents for ft- vs. /32receptors (delean et al., 1981, and data of table 1).

results
distribution of /3-receptors in myocardial
membranes
as a starting point to verify our techniques, we
determined the distribution of ft- and ft-receptors
in a membrane fraction of an homogenate of rat
heart ventricle.
the kinetics of binding of [125i]icyp to whole
ventricle membranes showed a large degree of high
affinity binding (kd = 23 pm, bmax = 91 fmol/mg
protein) that was readily competed for by /3-adrenergic antagonists. based on such competition of
[125i]icyp binding with the /3-subtype-specific
agents,  xxxd2991xxx  and zinterol, we calculated a distribution of ftreceptors of 65-70% ft and 30-35%
ft for whole ventricle (fig. 1). this relatively high
proportion of ft-receptors suggested to us that we
might reasonably expect to detect the appearance of
even a moderate fraction of either receptor subtype
in more purified fractions of cardiac tissue.
characteristics and distribution of /3-receptors
in purified myocytes
binding of [125i]icyp to the intact myocyte was
saturable with increasing radioligand concentration
(5-1000 p\i). scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms yielded linear plots indicating that [125i]icyp
bind to a single class of sites on the myocyte (fig.
2). the ability of the nonselective /3-adrenergic antagonist propranolol to compete for [125i]icyp bind-

ing, as well as the capacity of the (/)-isomer of the
ftagonist  xxxd2401xxx  to compete for [125i]icyp
binding with a greater affinity (ki = 80 nm) than the
d-isomer (k, = 2500 nm) confirmed that [125i]icyp
was binding to /3-adrenergic receptors on the myocytes. characteristics of the cardiomyocyte ftreceptor from scatchard analyses of several experiments are listed in table 1.
to determine the relative proportion of ft- and
ft-receptor subtypes on intact ventricular cardiomyocytes, we employed the ft -selective antagonists
betaxolol and  xxxd2991xxx  and the ft-selective agent
zinterol to compete for [125i]icyp binding to these
intact adult muscle cells. competition for [125i]icyp
binding by each antagonist resulted in monophasic
curves, demonstrating a single class of ft-adrenergic
binding sites (fig. 3). the ki value for both betaxolol

(46 nm) and  xxxd2991xxx  (800 nm) is consistent with
competition of these drugs for binding to a ftreceptor, whereas the ki value calculated for zinterol
binding (1.2 j*m) to the same receptor demonstrates
a much lower affinity than would be predicted for
the binding of zinterol to a /32-receptor [20 nm
(minneman et al., 1979a, 1979b, and table 1)].
similar results were obtained in membranes prepared from freshly purified myocytes. myocyte
membranes bound [12!t]icyp with high affinity (kd
= 52 pm) to a large number of sites, 188 fmol of
receptor/mg membrane protein. this density agrees
well with our estimate of 2.1 x 105 receptors/cell,
given that each cell has a measured membrane
protein content of 2.2 ng.  xxxd2991xxx  competed for
this binding in a monophasic manner with an affinity (ki) of 780 nm. this affinity is in excellent agreement with data for competition of [125i]icyp binding
to intact myocytes, shown above. thus, the results
with myocyte membranes confirm our finding a
single subtype of ft receptor (ft) on intact myocytes.
distribution of 0-receptor subtypes in
nonmyocyte membranes
because we detected only ft-receptors on ventricular myocytes, we anticipated that membranes prepared from the nonmyocyte components of the ventricle would reveal the presence of fo-adrenergic
receptors. saturation isotherms produced under conditions identical to those used to assay [125i]icyp
binding to purified myocytes gave linear scatchard
curves (fig. 4), indicating that the nonselective radiolabeled antagonist recognizes a single class of
binding sites in nonmyocyte membranes (kinetic
parameters summarized in table 2). however, competition of [125i]icyp binding to nonmyocyte membranes by betaxolol,  xxxd2991xxx  and zinterol occurred
over a broader concentration range than expected
for a single component interaction, indicating the
presence of both ft- and ft-receptors (fig. 5). data
of competition for [i25i]icyp binding by betaxolol
and  xxxd2991xxx  were best satisfied by a two-site fit

components of binding in the proportion 02-pi,

of these receptors with zinterol were 40 nm (ft) and
800 nm (ft). the ability of zinterol to compete with
high affinity for a large fraction (45%) of [125i]icyp
binding to nonmyocyte membranes is not the result
of the absence of added guanine nucleotide (gtp).

these membranes was compared with and without
100 fim added gtp, the guanine nucleotide caused
only a small rightward shift in the high and low
affinity components of binding. this slight shift
caused no change in the estimation of proportions
of ft- and ft-receptors present (fig. 6).
the resolution of ft- and ft-receptors by betaxolol,  xxxd2991xxx , and zinterol, the appropriateness of
their affinities, and the excellent agreement on the
relative densities of the receptor subtypes determined by these agents, demonstrate convincingly
that the nonmyocyte fraction contains ft- as well as
ft-receptors.
confirmation of the ability of methods applied
here to detect ft-adrenergic receptors was provided
by identical studies performed on a tissue known to
be a homogeneous source of ft-adrenergic receptors
(minneman et al., 1979c). binding of p25i]icyp to
rat liver membranes showed a single class of high
affinity sites (kd = 25 pm; bmax = 69 fmol/mg
membrane protein). competition of [125i]icyp binding to liver membranes by subtype-specific antagonists gave monophasic curves with affinities for
zinterol and  xxxd2991xxx  appropriate for a ft-receptor
(15 and 760 nm, respectively).

contain both ft- and ft-receptors (minneman,

previous studies in two principal ways. first, we
have purified ventricular myocytes from rat heart

from whole ventricle, purified cardiomyocytes, myocyte membranes, and the nonmyocyte fraction of
ventricle. second, we provide data on ftadrenergic

diomyocytes freshly prepared from adult animals,
in contrast to an earlier study employing fetal myoblasts adapted to tissue culture (lau et al., 1980).
employing antagonists selective for ft- or /^-receptors and the /3-specific radioligand [125i]icyp, we
find a single class of ft -receptors on purified ventricular myocytes. in the nonmyocyte fraction, however, approximately 50% of ft-receptors are of the
ft-subtype, data consistent with reports of as many
as 24% /32-receptors in rat heart ventricle (table 1,
and minneman et al., 1979a, 1979b), since our preparation represents a purification of both myocyte
(all ft) and nonmyocyte elements (contributing /32receptors). indeed, it seems likely to us that many
of the ft-receptors identified in the nonmyocyte
fraction of ventricle are contributed by damaged
myocytes that are excluded during myocyte purification.

it is, of course, possible that cardiomyocytes have
a small fraction of j82-receptors that we failed to
detect. applying the analysis described by delean
et al. (1981), we can estimate the limits of our ability
to discern a small population of /32-receptors. in
using a subtype-specific antagonist with a nonspecific labeled ligand in a competitive binding assay,
one needs an antagonist that exhibits a selectivity
between ft- and ft-receptors of ~50 to detect as
few as 10% ft-receptors. in our experiments, the
selectivities of the compounds were ~20 for  xxxd2991xxx  and zinterol and ~60 for betaxolol. thus,
within these limits (10% /82-receptors), which are the
likely limits imposed by experimental error, we do
not detect /32-receptors on the adult cardiomyocyte.
the number of ft-receptors found on each adult
myocyte, ~2 x 105, seems, at first glance, large. this
high density of receptor on the intact myocyte manifests itself as an appropriately high content of receptors in isolated membranes, ~162 fmol/mg pro-

buxton and brunton/0-receptor subtypes on rat cardiomyocytes

tein. our estimate compares favorably with that of
moustafa et al. (1978), who found 360,000 binding
sites for [3h]dihydroalprenolol per rat cardiomyocyte. the report of lau et al. (1980) of 7500 ft
receptors per myocyte in primary cultures of fetal
heart is probably not a relevant comparison, since
those cells were immature, far smaller than the adult
cells that we isolate, and possibly contaminated by
other cell types. densities of 103 to 104 receptors per
cell are routine in many prototypic cell systems (for
/3-receptors: s49 cells, -1200 cell; avian  xxxd187xxx ,
~600/cell; bc3h-1 cells, 9000/cell; c6 glioma cells,
~9400/cell). when expressed as a function of cell
size, the density of ftreceptors on myocytes falls in
this range. myocytes are large cells; ours average 20
^m x 90 jim. assuming that the myocyte is a cylinder of those dimensions, the surface density is 33
ft-receptors per  xxxg525xxx , compared to ~3 receptors/^m2
for s49 lymphoma cells, ~1 receptor/^tm2 for pigeon
 xxxd187xxx , 42 receptors/mm2 for c6 glioma cells (dibner et al., 1981), and 20 receptors//um2 for the bc3h1 smooth muscle cell (calculated from data of
hughes et al. (1982) and brown et al. (1984). thus,
the prevalence of ftadrenergic receptors per unit
area of myocyte membrane is not unusually high.
furthermore, if surface receptor density is a way in
which cells regulate their adrenergic responsiveness
(shear et al., 1976), then this number of ftreceptors
in a highly responsive tissue such as heart seems
reasonable.
the presence of ft- but not ft-receptors on rat
myocytes implies that the metabolic and contractile
response of rat ventricular muscle to ftagonists results exclusively from occupation of ft -receptors.
this conclusion varies from that reached by robberecht et al. (1983) and waelbroeck et al. (1983).
these workers have recently offered evidence that
human cardiac tissue has equal contents of ft- and
ft-receptors, and that only the ft-adrenergic receptors are coupled to adenylate cyclase. these studies
must be accepted with caution, however, since the
tissues employed were largely atrial and were from
patients who had been receiving ftblockade therapy. in addition, these human tissues, removed during surgical repair of coronary insufficiency or valvular disease, very likely represent diseased rather
than normal tissue and were certainly a population
of mixed cell types. the sort of study that we have
performed emphasizes the utility of a purified cell
population and provides a direct test of the proposal
of waelbroech and colleagues (1983).
