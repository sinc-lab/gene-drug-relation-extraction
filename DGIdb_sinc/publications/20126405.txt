abstract
background: the cytidine nucleoside analogs  xxxd253xxx  (aza) and  xxxd1823xxx  (dac) are used for the treatment of patients
with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (aml). few non-clinical studies have directly compared the
mechanisms of action of these agents in a head-to-head fashion, and the agents are often viewed as mechanistically similar
dna hypomethylating agents. to better understand the similarities and differences in mechanisms of these drugs, we
compared their in vitro effects on several end points in human aml cell lines.
methodology/principal findings: both drugs effected  xxxg644xxx  depletion, dna hypomethylation, and dna
damage induction, with dac showing equivalent activity at concentrations 2- to 10-fold lower than aza. at concentrations
above 1 mm, aza had a greater effect than dac on reducing cell viability. both drugs increased the sub-g1 fraction and
apoptosis markers, with aza decreasing all cell cycle phases and dac causing an increase in g2-m. total protein synthesis
was reduced only by aza, and drug-modulated gene expression profiles were largely non-overlapping.
conclusions/significance: these data demonstrate shared mechanisms of action of aza and dac on dna-mediated
markers of activity, but distinctly different effects in their actions on cell viability, protein synthesis, cell cycle, and gene
expression. the differential effects of aza may be mediated by rna incorporation, as the distribution of aza in nucleic acid
of kg-1a cells was 65:35, rna:dna.

regimens [14], dac did not demonstrate a statistically significant
improvement in survival in a similar clinical trial [15].
mechanisms of action that might explain differences in clinical
activities of aza and dac have not been clearly defined [16].
the conventional description of aza and dac as interchangeable dna hypomethylating agents overlooks potential additional
mechanisms of aza activity which are mediated via incorporation into newly synthesized rna, including rrnas, trnas,
mrnas, and mirnas. it has been shown that rna incorporation can account for 80–90% of the aza incorporated into
cellular nucleic acid [4]. the functional consequences of aza
incorporation into rna include alterations in the processing of
trna and rrnas, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis
[5,17–20]. in two recent publications, direct comparisons of aza
and dac activities have been made [9,21]. data support the
distinction of aza and dac as non-equivalent agents. in one
study, the sensitivities (ec50 values) of a panel of human cancer
cell lines to aza and dac showed no correlation, and an aml
cell line selected for resistance to dac remained sensitive to aza
[21]. in another head-to-head in vitro comparison of these agents,

introduction
 xxxd253xxx  (aza; vidazah, celgene corp., summit, nj) and
 xxxd1823xxx  (dac; dacogenh, eisai inc., woodcliff lake, nj) are
structurally related, but distinct, cytidine nucleoside analogs used
clinically for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (mds)
andacute myeloid leukemia (aml) [1,2]. aza is a  xxxd2246xxx 
and dac is a deoxyribonucleoside [3]. following cellular uptake
and sequential phosphorylations, aza is incorporated into both
rna and dna [4–6]. in contrast, dac is phosphorylated by
different kinases and is incorporated solely into dna [6]. once
incorporated into dna, aza and dac have related mechanisms
of action, including depletion of dna methyltransferases
(dnmts) [6,7], hypomethylation of dna [8,9], and induction
of dna damage [10,11]. in randomized controlled phase iii
clinical trials in patients with mds, overall response rates with
aza and dac have been similar [12–15]; however, overall
survival rates have differed. whereas aza demonstrated a
significantly increased median overall survival in higher-risk
mds patients (by 9.4 months) compared with conventional care

antibodies were from cell signaling technology inc. (danvers,
ma). the a-tubulin and dnmt1 antibodies were from emd
chemicals inc. (gibbstown, nj) and abcam inc. (cambridge,
ma), respectively. the goat anti-rabbit irdye 680 and goat
anti-mouse irdye 800cw secondary antibodies were from licor. nupage gels were purchased from life technologies
corporation (carlsbad, ca).

aza and dac had distinct effects on gene expression profiles in
kasumi-1 aml cells [9].
to increase our understanding of the different mechanisms
underlying aza and dac activity in aml, we directly compared
their in vitro effects on several end points in human aml cell lines.
specifically, we compared the dose-response effects of aza and
dac on cell viability, protein synthesis, dnmt1 protein, dna
damage, dna methylation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and gene
expression. additionally, we tested the relative incorporation of
aza into the dna and rna of kg-1a cells. we show that both
drugs modulate markers affected by dna incorporation; however,
the drugs have distinctly different effects on cell viability, protein
synthesis, cell cycle, and gene expression.

flow cytometry
for determination of cell cycle distribution, aml cell lines were
stained with nim-dapi reagent (beckman coulter, fullerton,
ca). duplicate samples were stained with annexinv-fitc and 7aad reagents (beckman coulter) for determination of early and
late apoptotic populations. samples were processed according to
manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed on a beckman coulter
cell lab quanta mpl flow cytometer.

methods
cell culture and drug treatments
human aml cell lines (thp-1 and hl-60) and media (rpmi1640 and mem) were purchased from american type culture
collection (manassas, va). other human aml cell lines (kg-1a
and oci-aml3) were purchased from dsmz gmbh (braunschweig, germany). cell lines were grown in their respective vendorrecommended culture media and passaged every 3–5 days. in all
experiments, cells were seeded approximately 24 hours before
drug treatment at 37uc, 5% co2, and cells were treated daily with
serial dilutions of freshly-prepared compounds. aza was manufactured at aptuit inc. (greenwich, ct) for celgene, and dac
was purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). the
concentrations used in experiments include the maximum
concentrations (cmax) achieved in human plasma at clinically
used dosages and schedules of administration. human plasma
cmax values are 3-11 mm aza and 0.3–1.6 mm dac [22,23,24].
radiolabeled aza, [14c]-aza, was supplied by aptuit inc., with
the radiolabel on c-4 and a specific activity of 13.7 mci/mmol.

dna methylation analysis
genomic dna was purified from cells using the dneasy blood
and tissue kit (qiagen, valencia, ca) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. dna yield was quantitated on a
nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer (thermo fisher scientific
inc). dnas (0.5 mg/sample) were submitted to epigendx
(worcester, ma) for line-1 methylation analysis. line-1
methylation was determined by pyrosequencing of bisulfiteconverted dna. percent line-1 methylation represents the
average percentage methylation of four cpg sites in duplicate
samples. dnas were submitted to expression analysis inc.
(durham, nc) for array-based methylation analysis of 1505
cpg loci selected from 807 genes (illumina goldengate
methylation cancer panel i), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. for inclusion in analysis, samples were required to
have $80% loci ($1204 loci) with detection p-values,0.05 and a
spearman correlation coefficient of $0.7 between biologic
duplicates.

cell viability
aml cells were seeded in triplicate at 16104 cells per well in
96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37uc, 5% co2. cells
were treated daily with serial dilutions (0.02–50 mm) of freshlyprepared aza or dac and incubated at 37uc, 5% co2 for
72 hours. cell viability was assessed 72 hours after the initial drug
treatment using the celltiter-glo assay (promega, madison, wi).
luminescence was measured with a spectrophotometer (molecular
devices, sunnyvale, ca) at 1500 msec. ec50 values were
calculated in prism version 5.01 (graphpad software, inc.,
la jolla, ca) using results from two or three independent
experiments.

gene expression analysis
cells were lysed using trizol reagent (life technologies
corporation) and total rna was isolated using mirneasy
(qiagen). double-stranded cdna was synthesized using 200 ng
of total rna. biotin-labeled crna was synthesized using
messageamp arna kit (ambion, austin, tx), and 15 mg of
crna was fragmented and hybridized to each human u133a 2.0
gene chipset (affymetrix, santa clara, ca). the gc-rma
algorithm was used for analysis and all analyses were carried out
using genespring 7.3 (agilent, santa clara, ca). averaged signals
from biological duplicate samples were used to determine foldchange (treated versus untreated), with absolute fold change of
$1.7 defining regulated genes. nextbio was used to identify
regulated biogroups (based on the gene ontology consortium)
from lists of regulated genes.

western analysis
aml cells were seeded in either 10-cm dishes at 2.56106 cells
per dish, or 6-well plates at 56105 cells per well, and incubated
overnight at 37uc, 5% co2. drug treated aml cells were lysed
in ripa buffer (millipore, billerica, ma), containing protease
inhibitors (roche applied sciences, indianapolis, in) and
phosphatase inhibitors (sigma-aldrich), on ice for 30–60
minutes and then centrifuged to clear cell debris. protein
concentrations were determined using the bca protein assay
(thermo fisher scientific inc., waltham, ma). proteins were
separated on bis-tris nupage gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. dnmt1, phospho- xxxg1009xxx , cleavedparp, and a-tubulin were detected using the li-cor odyssey
(li-cor biotechnology, lincoln, ne) imaging system, following
incubation with the appropriate primary and secondary
antibodies. the phospho- xxxg1009xxx  (ser 139) and cleaved-parp

incorporation of radiolabeled aza into nucleic acid
incorporation of [14c]-aza into the dna and rna of kg-1a
cells was determined at southern research institute (birmingham,
al). kg-1a cells (16105 cells/ml, 36t75 flasks, 50 ml/flask)
were incubated with 0.3 mm [14c]-aza for 24 hours. radioactive
measurement of the trichloroacetic acid (tca)-precipitable
fraction, representing total nucleic acid (rna + dna), was
performed as previously described [25,26]. alkali-stable, tcaprecipitable radioactivity is a measure of the incorporation of
nucleosides into dna. for its determination, cell lysates were
incubated with 2n naoh overnight at 37uc, prior to neutrali2

cells were treated with aza or dac for 24 or 48 hours,
replacing the media and adding freshly prepared aza or dac
after 24 hours. following drug treatments, cells were incubated
with methionine/cysteine-free media for 30 minutes. twenty mci
of 35s-methionine and 35s-cysteine were then added to cells for
1 hour. cells were rinsed with methionine/cysteine-free media
and then with pbs, prior to lysis in buffer (promega) with protease
inhibitors (roche). cell lysates were precipitated with 20% tca
for 1 hour on ice. the precipitate was filtered through a glass
microfiber disc and rinsed extensively with cold 20% tca,
followed by cold ethanol. radioactivity was measured using a
scintillation counter. radioactive counts were normalized to cell
numbers, determined in parallel cultures using the celltiter-glo
assay (promega).

the differential activity of aza compared with dac may be
explained by differences in the targeted cell sub-populations of
asynchronously growing cell cultures. the half-lives of aza and
dac in cell culture are short (,8–12 hours), necessitating daily
treatment to ensure continued exposure (data not shown). aza
may have activity in cells during all phases of the cell cycle via
rna incorporation, whereas dac incorporation into dna is
restricted to the s-phase and may limit the number of affected cells
at any given treatment time. to test the hypothesis that additional
treatments with dac could further reduce cell viability, a doseresponse evaluation was performed in kg-1a cells at 2, 3, 4, 5 and
6 days, with daily dac addition (figure s2). cell viability was
further reduced at each later time point, with a reduction to
,15% cell viability by 6 days. these data demonstrate that to
achieve a similar reduction in cell viability with dac versus aza,
cells must be more extensively treated.

results
aml cell lines have differential sensitivities to aza
versus dac
four human aml cell lines were assessed for their sensitivity to
daily treatment with aza or dac in 72 hour cell viability assays
(figure 1, figure s1). dose-response curves and ec50 values
were established for each drug (table 1). all aml cell lines were
sensitive to both drugs, with reduced cell viability observed at
concentrations $1 mm; however, the maximal amounts of
viability reduction with aza and dac differed. at high drug
concentrations (.1 mm) aza was consistently more potent than
dac, reducing cell viability to 0–20% at concentrations above
5 mm. dac, in contrast, did not reduce cell viability below 40% at
any concentration up to 50 mm.

aza is incorporated into both rna and dna in kg-1a
cells
a previous study in a mouse leukemia cell line demonstrated
that aza incorporated into rna and dna at a ratio of
approximately 85:15, respectively [4]. to determine the relative

2 or 3 independent experiments, including triplicate wells per experiment. aml = acute myeloid leukemia; aza =  xxxd253xxx ; dac =  xxxd1823xxx .

comparison to aza (1 mm). dnmt1 protein depletion occurred
at clinically relevant drug concentrations. similar effects on
dnmt1 depletion were observed at 48 and 72 hour time points.
dna methylation was measured in drug-treated (48 hour) cells
using pyrosequencing of line-1 dna elements in bisulfiteconverted dna. dna methylation of line-1 repeat elements
serves as a surrogate measure of global dna methylation. a
decrease in line-1 dna methylation was observed at aza
concentrations of 0.3–1 mm and dac concentrations of 0.03–
1 mm, with maximal hypomethylation observed at concentrations
of approximately 1 mm aza and 0.3 mm dac in both cell lines
(figure 5a). the doses inducing maximal hypomethylation
paralleled the doses that maximally depleted dnmt1 protein.
in addition to evaluating changes in the line-1 dna
methylation, we also evaluated dna methylation changes at
1505 gene-specific cpg loci using the illumina goldengate dna
methylation platform (table s1). methylation changes were
summarized by plotting the number of highly methylated loci,
defined as loci with beta scores .0.8, versus drug concentration.
similar to findings with line-1 dna methylation, the goldengate assay showed the greatest reduction in highly methylated
cpg loci at concentrations of 1 mm aza and 0.3 mm dac in
both cell lines (figure 5b). similar changes in dna methylation
were observed with 72 hour drug treatments, using both dna
methylation assays (data not shown).

distribution of aza into rna and dna in a human aml cell
line, we measured incorporation of radiolabeled aza ([14c]-aza)
into total nucleic acid, rna (alkali-labile nucleic acid) and dna
(alkali-stable nucleic acid) of kg-1a cells (figure 2). [14c]-aza
was incorporated into both rna and dna of kg-1a cells in a
time-dependent manner (data not shown). after a 24 hour
incubation with 0.3 mm [14c]-aza, the radioactivity incorporated
into the nucleic acid was distributed at a ratio of 65:35,
rna:dna. [14c]-dac, with an appropriately labeled carbon,
was not available for direct comparison. these data confirmed the
expectation that aza incorporates into both rna and dna in a
human aml cell line, with predominant incorporation into rna
compared with dna.

aza and dac have different effects on protein synthesis
protein synthesis inhibition via rna incorporation of aza has
been described as a mechanism of aza activity [5]. the effects of
aza and dac on protein synthesis were compared by metabolic
labeling (35s-methionine and 35s-cysteine) of kg-1a and thp-1
cells after 24 and 48 hours of daily drug treatment (figure 3).
aza (2 mm) treatment significantly reduced protein synthesis in
both cell lines, inhibiting protein synthesis at 48 hours by 51% and
58% in kg-1a and thp-1 cells, respectively. dac did not reduce
protein synthesis in either cell line at 2 mm. significant inhibition
of protein synthesis with aza (2 mm), but not dac, was also seen
at 24 hours, with synthesis reduced by 41% and 43% in kg-1a
and thp-1 cells, respectively. notably, the aza concentrations
that affected protein synthesis (2–5 mm) were also concentrations
at which greater effects on cell viability were observed for aza
versus dac.

aza and dac induce dna damage in kg-1a and thp-1
cells
induction of dna damage by aza and dac was measured
using phospho- xxxg1009xxx  (ser 139) as a marker of double stranded
dna breaks. in drug-treated kg-1a and thp-1 cells, dose- and
time-dependent induction of phospho- xxxg1009xxx  was observed with
both aza and dac (figure 4). in kg-1a cells, induction of
phospho- xxxg1009xxx  above basal levels was observed at aza
concentrations $1 mm at 48 and 72 hour time points. dac, in
contrast, caused a significantly greater increase in phospho- xxxg1009xxx 
at lower drug concentrations ($0.03 mm). notably, dna damage
was induced at clinically-relevant drug concentrations for both
drugs. similar results were seen in the thp-1 cell line, with dac
having greater potency than aza at inducing dna damage;

aza and dac cause depletion of dnmt1 protein and
dna hypomethylation in kg-1a and thp-1 cells
dna-mediated effects of aza and dac were evaluated, using
dnmt1 protein depletion and dna hypomethylation as markers
of drug incorporation into the dna of kg-1a and thp-1 cell
lines. in each cell line, dnmt1 protein was reduced by both aza
and dac in a dose-dependent manner (figure 4). complete
dnmt1 depletion, as measured by western analysis, was
achieved with lower concentrations of dac (0.1–0.3 mm), in

the amount of aza incorporated into total nucleic acid, dna, and rna was quantified as described previously. standard error of the mean was
determined from 3 independent experiments, including triplicate wells per experiment. aza =  xxxd253xxx .

however, higher aza (3–10 mm) and dac (1–3 mm) concentrations were required to induce significant dna damage in thp-1
cells, in comparison to kg-1a cells.

dependent effects of aza and dac on markers of apoptosis were
evaluated by flow cytometry of kg-1a cells treated for 48 hours
and stained with annexinv-fitc and 7-aad to detect early and
late apoptotic events (figure 6b). parp cleavage was also
evaluated by western analysis (figure 6c). an increase in the
percentage of kg-1a cells undergoing apoptosis was detected by
both flow and western analyses with aza ($1 mm) and dac
($0.03 mm). similar results were observed at the 72 hour time
point (data not shown). in both analyses, dac was more potent
than aza at increasing markers of apoptosis. the greater cell kill
observed with aza versus dac in viability assays (figure 1),
despite less effect on markers of apoptosis, suggests that
mechanisms other than apoptosis are contributing to azamediated cell death.

aza and dac have differential effects on cell cycle in
kg-1a cells
to better understand the differential effects observed with aza
and dac in cell viability assays, we analyzed drug-treated
(48 hours) kg-1a cells for dose-dependent changes in cell cycle
by flow cytometry of nim-dapi-stained cells (figure 6a). aza
concentrations below 1 mm had no significant effect on cell cycle,
whereas aza concentrations of 1 mm or greater caused an
increase in the sub-g1 fraction of cells and a concomitant decrease
in all other phases of the cell cycle. dac dose-dependently
increased the sub-g1 phase; however, in contrast to aza, dac
also increased the g2-m phase, with a concomitant decrease in the
g0/g1 phase. maximal increase in the g2-m fraction of cells
occurred with 0.3 mm dac. similar results were observed at a
72 hour time point (data not shown).

aza and dac regulate different genes in kg-1a cells
to further explore similarities and differences in the mechanisms of action of aza compared with dac, the molecular
pathways regulated by each drug were explored using geneexpression profiling of kg-1a cells treated with a dose range (0.3–
3 mm) of each drug for 24 and 48 hours. genes with an absolute
fold change of $1.7 following drug treatment were defined as
regulated genes. as shown in table 2, aza regulated few genes
at 0.3 mm; however, higher concentrations (1–3 mm) significantly
increased the number of genes regulated. dac regulated more
genes than aza only at 0.3 mm for 48 hours. generally, aza

aza and dac increase markers of apoptosis in kg-1a
cells
the observation that aza and dac treatment cause an
increase in the sub-g1 phase of the kg-1a cell cycle prompted us
to explore drug-induced effects on markers of apoptosis. doseplos one | www.plosone.org

(1–3 mm) regulated a greater number of genes compared with
dac (1–3 mm). gene expression values are provided in table
s2. venn analysis of the genes modulated by each drug revealed

that the majority of genes regulated by aza and dac are drugspecific (figure 7). equimolar concentrations (1 mm), as well as
concentrations approximating equipotency on dna hypomethylation (1 mm aza versus 0.3 mm dac), were compared. when
comparing 1 mm concentrations at 24 hours, the number of
uniquely regulated genes represented 90% and 67% of the total
number of genes regulated by aza and dac, respectively.
lists of the drug-regulated genes were analyzed using nextbio
in order to identify the affected gene ontology biogroups. table 3
lists the biogroups that were most significantly regulated by aza
and dac in kg-1a cells treated for 24 and 48 hours. the
biogroups most significantly regulated at each time point were
different for aza and dac. aza (1 mm) most significantly
regulated biogroups representing metabolic processes, aminoacyltrna ligase activity and mitochondrion at 24 hours, as well as
mitosis, cell cycle, and cell division at 48 hours. in contrast, dac
(1 mm) significantly upregulated the cell differentiation biogroup at
both 24 and 48 hours. the biogroup of genes representing
aminoacyl-trna ligase activity was significantly regulated by both
aza and dac; however, aza upregulated this biogroup at
24 hours, while dac downregulated this biogroup at 48 hours.

cells were treated daily with aza or dac (0.323 mm) for 24 and 48 hours, and
rna was isolated for evaluation of gene expression using affymetrix human
u133a 2.0 gene chipset. the table shows the number of genes regulated by
aza and dac at different drug concentrations. duplicate samples of each were
averaged and compared with untreated samples. a fold change of $1.7 in gene
expression was considered as regulated.

frame of the cell viability assessment; therefore, the differential
effects on cell viability cannot be accounted for solely by epigenetic
mechanisms. the greater potency of dac versus aza, based on
calculated ec50 values, does not take into account the plateau
effect on cell viability observed with dac, in which increasing
drug concentrations above 1 mm did not lead to a further
reduction in cell viability below 40% after 3 days. this plateau
effect with dac likely reflects the fact that dac activity is specific
to dna incorporation in the s-phase of the cell cycle [29], and
treating cells for additional days could further reduce cell viability.
although aza incorporation into dna would similarly be sphase restricted, aza incorporation into rna should occur in all
phases of the cell cycle. in fact, previous studies showed that aza
(2–8 mm) induction of apoptosis in the human aml cell line hl60 was preferential to g1-phase cells and occurred in a short
timeframe (4–8 hours), implicating an rna mechanism [30,31].
aza inhibited protein synthesis at 24 hours post-treatment, an
effect occurring within the doubling time of these cells. earlier
time points were not evaluated. dac, in contrast, did not inhibit
protein synthesis. the inhibition of protein synthesis by aza was
observed at concentrations that reduced cell viability below that of
dac, suggesting that the anti-leukemic activity of aza observed
at drug concentrations .1 mm may be explained by mechanisms
in addition to, or other than, dna-mediated mechanisms. in
multiple myeloma cell lines, aza reduced  xxxg1181xxx -ra protein levels
within 2 hours, and to an equal extent as cycloheximide,
consistent with a mechanism involving protein synthesis inhibition
[32].

dnmt1 depletion, hypomethylation of dna, induction of dna
damage, cell cycle, induction of apoptosis, and gene expression.
both aza and dac regulated molecular end points related to
drug incorporation into dna, including dnmt1 depletion, dna
hypomethylation, and induction of the dna damage marker
phospho- xxxg1009xxx . dac affected these dna-mediated markers at
concentrations 2- to 10-fold lower than those of aza, likely due to
greater incorporation of dac into dna [4,27]. previous direct
comparisons of the dna hypomethylating activities of aza and
dac have also shown that dac is more potent in this regard
[9,28]. the experiment in kg-1a cells evaluating aza incorporation into rna and dna showed a distribution of 65% and
35%, respectively. if the rates of cellular uptake and nucleic acid
incorporation for aza and dac are similar, a 3-fold decrease in
potency on dna-mediated markers would be expected when
comparing equimolar amounts of aza versus dac. differences in
clinical dosing and scheduling may influence the extent of dnamediated activities of these drugs in patients.
differences between the mechanisms of action of aza and
dac were observed in their activities on cell viability, protein
synthesis, cell cycle, and gene expression. consistent differences in
the dose-response curves of aza compared with dac on cell
viability were observed in four human aml cell lines, with aza
having a greater effect than dac at reducing cell viability at drug
concentrations above 1 mm. clinically achievable plasma concentrations are 3–11 mm aza and 0.3–1.6 mm dac [22,23,24]. it is
important to note that aza and dac both caused depletion of
dnmt1 protein and dna hypomethylation, within the timeplos one | www.plosone.org

directions, further suggesting mechanistic differences between
these drugs. our findings are consistent with a recently published
gene expression comparison of aza and dac in the aml cell
line kasumi-1, although low concentrations of each drug (0.5 mm
aza and 0.05 mm dac) were used in that study [9]. pathway
analysis of the regulated genes provided intriguing insights into the
cellular actions of these drugs. aza significantly downregulated
genes involving cell cycle, cell division and mitosis, whereas dac
significantly upregulated genes involved in cell differentiation
(table 3).
these data illustrate similarities and differences in the
mechanisms of action of aza and dac. historically, these drugs
have been viewed as mechanistically similar dna hypomethylating agents, and both have been described as having dosedependent, dual mechanisms of action [1,2]. for dac, the ‘‘dual
mechanism’’ has referred to inhibition of cell proliferation at high
doses and a dna hypomethylation-mediated effect on gene reexpression at low doses, affecting processes of cell differentiation,
tumor suppression, and stimulation of immune mechanisms [2].
for aza, the ‘‘dual mechanism’’ has referred to cytotoxicity at
high doses, via rna and dna incorporation, and dna
hypomethylation at lower doses [1]. certainly both drugs have
dose-dependent effects; however, previously described ‘‘dual
mechanisms’’ of these drugs should not be interpreted as shared.
we show that both drugs modulated markers of azanucleoside
incorporation into dna (dnmt1 depletion, dna damage
induction, and dna hypomethylation); however, dac demonstrated a greater effect on these markers. also, although aza and
dac increased the sub-g1 fraction of cells and markers of
apoptosis, aza demonstrated a greater effect on reducing cell
viability and decreasing protein synthesis. it is clear that the antileukemic activities of aza and dac differ in vitro, with dac
acting solely through dna-mediated mechanisms (epigenetic
and/or dna damage), and aza acting via mechanisms in
addition to, or other than, incorporation into dna. translational
research will be key to understanding how the mechanistic
differences observed between aza and dac in vitro will be best
applied to the clinical utility of these drugs.

biogroups of genes regulated $1.7-fold by daily treatment with aza (1 mm) or
dac (1 mm) in kg-1a cells at 24 and 48 hours. directionality indicates the
predominant direction of gene regulation within each biogroup. p-values of

differences in cell cycle regulation with aza and dac were
also observed in kg-1a cells. although both drugs increased the
sub-g1 fraction of cells, dac caused a concomitant increase in
g2-m and decrease in g0/g1 phases of the cell cycle, whereas
aza decreased all phases of the cell cycle. the increase in g2-m
phase with dac in kg-1a cells is consistent with previous
observations in other hematopoietic tumor cell lines [33,34]. both
drugs increased markers of apoptosis, including  xxxg166xxx 
staining and cleaved-parp. increased apoptosis has also been
observed with aza and dac treatment of other leukemic cell
lines [11,30,31,33,35–37]. the lesser effect of aza compared with
dac on markers of apoptosis, despite greater cell killing with
aza, suggests that mechanisms other than apoptosis are
contributing to aza-mediated programmed cell death.
finally, microarray analysis of gene expression in kg-1a cells
revealed differences between aza and dac. at low concentrations (,0.3 mm), very few genes were regulated at the 24 and
48 hour time points by either drug (data not shown). in contrast, at
high concentrations ($1 mm) over 1000 genes could be regulated
(table 2), and aza regulated a greater number of genes
compared with dac. the concentrations of aza that led to
significant gene modulation were also the concentrations that
affected cell viability. when comparing the lists of genes that were
regulated by aza (1 mm) and dac (0.3 and 1 mm), a minority of
genes were commonly regulated. it should be noted that 5–25% of
the genes identified as ‘‘commonly regulated’’ in the overlapping
venn diagram were regulated by aza and dac in opposite
