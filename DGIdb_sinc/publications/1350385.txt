development of clinical trials with
tax01 is a major accomplishment
because of the myriad problems
associated with this drug (see refs
4,s). in 197l, nearly a decade after
the first samples of the yew tree
were collected as part of a search
for new plant products with anticancer activity, wall and his colleagues elucidated the structure of
tax01 and reported on its cytotoxicity against the kb cell line and
mouse leukemia cell@.
the source of tax01 has been the
bark of the exceptionally slowgrowing western yew, tuxus
breuifilia, found primarily in oldgrowth forests in the pacific
northwesi7. procurement of the
bark and isolation of tax01 results
in a low yield of drug and death of
the tree. this source of tax01 is
totally inadequate for the clinical
studies that are needed, and total
synthesis of the drug has not yet
been achieved.
however, progress has been
made in the preparation of semisynthetic
tax01 and tax01 analogues, such as taxotere, from lodeacetyl baccatin iii, a precursor
of tax01 that is isolated from the
needles of taxus kccafas. in contrast to the bark, the needles can
regenerate and thus provide a

li addition to the scarcity of the
drug, tax01 is an extremely hydrophobic molecule, whose formulation has been fraught with
problems, some of which may be
responsible for the serious allergic
reactions that have been seen in
patients receiving the drug (see
refs 4,s).
tax01 has an unusual chemistry.
it is a complex diterpene having
a taxane ring system with a fourmembered oxetane ring and an
ester sidechain at position c-13.
structur+activity
studies with
tax01 analogues and natural product precursors of the drug have
demonstrated that modifications
at both the c-7 and c-10 positions
are tolerated with only minor
losses of activity but that the sidechain at position c-13 on the
taxane ring is necessary for activity in mammalian cellsg. this is
unfortunate since baccatin iii is
available from the needles of the
plant but clearly requires modification before it is active. although
the sidechain is necessary, it can
be modified and retain activity, as
in taxoterelo,l’.
esterification at the c-2’ position
in the sidechain results in a loss
of activity with purified components in an in vitro system, but
total activity is retained in cells,

thereby suggesting metabolism to
an active compound in. living
cellsr2. it has been noted that
compounds s; xxxg560xxx  as taxol and
taxoterc that are 2’~/3’s diastereoisomers are most active in the
micirctub-u_lesystem11j3. when the
3’“amide
substituent
was removed in a series of taxol analogues, tubulin polymerization
was no longer sensitive to the
c-2’ configuration. these studies
suggested that the 3’-amide substituent plays an important role in
preorganizing the taxol sidechain
to bind to microtubules13.
the biological properties of this
rare ring system had not been
studied before 1971, when the
structure of tax01 was first published. tax01 is a potent inhibitor
of eukaryotic
cell replication,
blocking cells in the late g2mitotic phase of the cell cycle.
interaction of tax01 with cells
results in the formation of discrete
bundles of stable microtubules as
a consequence of a reorganization
of the microtubule cytoskeleton14.
in human leukemic cell lines
treated with clinically relevant
concentrations
of taxol,
both
microtubule bundles and asters
are seen. microtubule
bundle
formation is related to the sensitivity of the cell line to taxol15. in
a phase i clinical trial in leukemia,
it was shown that the response to
tax01 was directly related to the
ability of leukemic blasts to form
microtubule bundles16.
microtubules
are not static
organelles but rather are in a state
of dynamic equilibrium with their

components, the tubulin dimers.
tax01 alters this normal equilibrium shifting it in favor of the
microtubule
(fig. 2), thereby
lowering the critical concentration
of tub&n required to form microtubulesl’. in addition to being .an
essential component of the mitotic
spindle and required for the
maintenance of cell shape, microtubules are involved in a tide
variety of cellular activities, such
as cell motility and transport between organelles within the cell.
any disruption of the equilibrium
within the microtubule system
would be expected to disrupt cell
division and normal cellular activities in which microtubules are
involved.
experiments
with
purified
tubulin demonstrated that tax01
enhanced
polymerization
of
tubulin, even in the absence of
gtl? and microtubule-associated
proteins’3*19, factors
that are
normally required for microtubule
assembly. microtubules that are
assembled in the presence of
taxol, or to which taxol is added,
are stable to cold and  xxxg2125xxx ,, which
normally disrupt the polymer.
tax01 binds specifically and reversibly to microtubules (preferentially the p subunit of tubulirp)
with a stoichiometry approaching
onezl and an apparent binding
constant, kapp, of =lodm.
the
drug binds to cells in a specific
and saturable manner with a
single set of high-affinity binding
sites=. incubation of cells with
colchicine or vinblastine, drugs
that depolymerize microtubules,
eliminates taxol binding, strongly
indicating that microtubules are
a specific target for the drug.
although tax01 binds to cells
depleted of cellular atp, bundle
formation does not take place
under these conditions. the two
processes therefore appear to be
distincp.
the ability of taxol to polymerize tubulin into stable microtubules in the absence of any
cofactors and to induce the formation
of stable microtubule
bundles in cells are the unique
characteristics of this drug. tax01
is thus a prototype for a new
class of antitumor drug and has
focused attention on microtubules
as a worthy target for cancer
chemotherapeutic
drugs. however, at the molecular level, the

acts with miaotubules and blocks
cells in mitosis is poorly understood. essentially there is no information on the site(s) at which
tax01 binds to microtubules or on
the specificity that tax01 displays
toward certain malignant tumors.
taxol-resistant tumor cells have
been isolated and analysed in the
laboratory. two distinct forms of
resistance have been described. a
series of mutant chinese hamster
ovary cells= have altered lx-and/
or @-tubulin subunits that confer
resistance to taxol; others have
become dependent on taxol, and
actually require the drug for cell
replication. the altered tubulin
subunits were identified by aberrant migration during electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels.
taxol’s extreme hydrophobic
nature and its natural product origin make it a perfect candidate for
the induction of the multidrug
resistance phenotype. a highly resistant cell line selected with taxol
from drug-sensitive murine tumor
j774.2 cells displays this phenofype# including overproduction
of p-glycoprotein2425. the latter
is an integral membrane glycoprotein that acts as an energydependent drug efflux pump to
maintain intracellular drug concentrations below cytotoxic levels.
resistance to taxol in human
leukemia cell lines has been correlated with the development of
polyploid cells%; however, there
is little information on the types
of resistance that may develop in
human tumors.
although the number of studies
with taxol in human tumors in
patients is limited, the investi-

gations that have been completed
indicate that tax01 has the potential to become an important new
drug for the treatment of malignancies. so far, tax01 has been
used as a single agent, but its
efficacy as an antitumor agent
may be enhanced in combination
with other drugs and/or radiation.
in addition to its clinical role, taxol
provides a tool for studying the
regulation of microtubule assembly-disassembly and the cellular functions of microtubules. this
is proving to be a useful aspect of
the drug, particularly since the
action of tax01 seems specific for
the tubulin/microtubule system.
for example, tax01 has facilitated
the isolation of microtubuleassociated proteins and of small
quantities of tubulin from a wide
variety of celwa.

occasionally, the construction of hypotheses
to
account for natural phenomena exemplifies the johnsonian dictum
concerning the triumph of hope over experience. in the face of
experience and knowledge, there is a deep-seated psychological
tendency to posit simple causes for complex phenomena. this

the high incidence of stomach
consumption per se, as other ricecancer in japan is a matter of
indubitable
observationl.
for
1977, the age-adjusted death-rates
were 52.3 per 100000 japanese
men as opposed to 6.6 per 100000
for american men’. the explanations that have been advanced
accounting for this form a testament to the imaginative ingenuity
of scientists.
the japanese eat a lot of rice.
the rice is dusted with talc. talc
typically contains asbestos fibers.
workers exposed to asbestos have
increased rates of stomach cance?.
therefore,
the high rate of
stomach cancer in japan is due to

eating countries where the rice is
not dusted with talc do not exhibit
high rates of stomach cancer.
the logic is seamless, satisfying
and convincing. and also fallacious. it is the same fallacy of
selective knowledge that impels
the investor to rush out and buy
stocks in a company of which he
or she has just read a positive
report in his newspaper. the fallacy is twofold. first, information
about competing hypotheses (or
companies) is not considered.
secondly, the information considered is incomplete. but, like the
unwise investor, lacking specialist

information in the area, we tend
to believe the last theory to which
we have been exposed.
however, if eating talc-treated
rice is the explanation, why is the
death-rate from stomach cancer of
japanese women only half that of
mer?? what explains why the
death-rate for men in america is
more than five times the deathrate among egyptian males*?
indeed, merliss’ theory came
under immediate criticism on a
number of groundss7, including
the claim that japanese women
washed rice before using it, and
therefore the talc would be removed, that the californian talc
used on merliss’ samples is more
dangerous than japanese talc, and
that in japanese patients with
adenocarcinomas only talc crystals
can be found in cancerous gastric
cells, not asbestos fibers7. in place
of merliss’ theory, his critics had
their own explanations
as to
cause, which ranged from smoked
and salted fish5, the soy sauce,
pickles and seaweed added to rice
to make it more palatabpes, to
aflatoxins in the rice because of
poor storage’.
complicating factors are that
the younger the population, the
higher the relative risk in japan
compared with the usa9. thus,
whereas japanese men over the
age of 85 have twice the risk of
age-matched americans, japanese
in the 25-29 year age-bracket have
18 times the risk of americans. in
