abstract: the phosphodiesterase-11a (pde11) family consists of four splice variants (pde11a1pde11a4) that contain a conserved carboxyl-terminal (c-terminal) catalytic domain that hydrolyzes camp
and cgmp; the amino-termini (n-termini) vary in length and amino acid sequence. pde11a2, pde11a3,
and pde11a4 contain one or more gaf (cgmp-binding phosphodiesterase, anabaena adenylyl cyclase,
and escherichia coli fhla) subdomains. in the present study, pde11a1 and pde11a2 demonstrated
higher affinity for camp and cgmp when directly compared to that of the longest isoform, pde11a4.
moreover, pde11a3, pde11a2, and pde11a1, which contain progressively shorter n-termini, were
more sensitive than pde11a4 to inhibition by two structurally unrelated inhibitors, tadalafil (cialis) and
vardenafil (levitra). the substrate and inhibitor affinity differences among the pde11 isozymes could
not be ascribed to differences in their quaternary structure since pde11a4, pde11a3, and pde11a2
were determined to be dimers, and pde11a1 was a tetramer. these data also demonstrate that pde11
isozymes containing at least 123 c-terminal amino acids of the gaf-b domain are stable oligomers and
that gaf-a is not required for oligomerization. the isolated pde11 catalytic domain (met-563-asn934) displayed both monomeric and dimeric forms, and upon dilution, this domain was primarily
monomeric, indicating that the main oligomerization contacts are within the n-termini of pde isozymes.
this report is the first to describe an inhibitory effect of the n-terminal region of pde11a4 on the affinity
of the catalytic domain for both substrates and inhibitors and the first to define the quaternary structure
and the regions that contribute to this structure within the human  xxxg1691xxx  family.

 xxxd1773xxx  (camp1) and  xxxd1274xxx  (cgmp) are cyclic
nucleotide (cn) second messengers that modulate virtually
all physiological processes. intracellular levels of cns are
dependent primarily on two opposing enzyme activities: cn
synthesis by adenylyl or guanylyl cyclases and cn hydrolysis
by cn phosphodiesterases (cn-pdes). cn-pdes consist of
a superfamily of metallophosphohydrolases that catalyze
hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphate bond of camp, cgmp,
or both cns to their respective 5′ noncyclic forms (1-6).
given the pivotal role that pdes play in modulating cellular
cn levels and their potential as pharmacological targets, it
is important to determine the biochemical characteristics that

provide for their regulatory and catalytic mechanisms (7).
four human pde11 isozymes (figure 1) have been described
(pde11a1-pde11a4), which arise from a single gene via
alternative mrna splicing. these isozymes are considered
to have dual specificity since they hydrolyze both camp
and cgmp. all four human pde11 isozymes consist of a
conserved c-terminal pde catalytic domain that hydrolyzes
camp and cgmp, and n-terminal domains of varying
lengths. in addition, each of the pde11 isozymes contains
either intact gafs or portions of a gaf (cgmp-binding
phosphodiesterase, anabaena adenylyl cyclase, and escherichia coli fhla) sequence (figure 1) (8-12). gafs subserve
variable functions in proteins, but most gafs in mammalian
proteins are found in cn-pdes (1, 13). human pde11a4
consists of 934 amino acids with an n-terminal domain of
unknown functions and a c-terminal catalytic domain that
hydrolyzes cn substrates; the sequence includes two consensus phosphorylation sites for camp-dependent protein
kinase (pka) or cgmp-dependent protein kinase (pkg). on
the basis of the smart domain prediction program,
pde11a4 contains two gaf subdomains (termed gaf-a
and gaf-b) that extend from residues 217 to 380 and 402
to 568, respectively. in pde11a3, there is a partial gaf-a
subdomain that shares the final 75 residues of gaf-a of
pde11a4; the 54 residues of pde11a3 n-terminal to these
conserved 75 residues are unique and absent in the other
pde11 isozymes (9, 10). pde11a1 and pde11a2 are

detected in human tissues (24, 25). the pde5 catalytic site
and the pde11 catalytic site have the highest sequence
identity (51%) within the mammalian pde superfamily, and
moderate cross-reactivity of the pde5-selective inhibitor
cialis (tadalafil, lilly-icos) has been demonstrated (5),
although the extent of cross-reactivity has not been quantified
among all pde11 isozymes. to provide insight into the
influence of the n-terminal domains of pde11 isozymes on
catalytic function, inhibitor potency, and the potential
relationship between the oligomeric state and these properties, we have characterized in a head-to-head manner all
natural human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes as well as the isolated
pde11 catalytic domain.

figure 1: schematic representation of human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes
and the isolated pde11 catalytic domain. pde11a1-pde11a4 were
expressed in sf9 cells via a baculovirus expression system as
outlined under experimental procedures. the isolated pde11
catalytic domain was expressed in e. coli as described in experimental procedures. residue numbers of pde11a4 and pde11a3
are shown above the depictions. residues contained in pde11a2,
pde11a1, and the catalytic domain are all present in pde11a4,
while pde11a3 contains a unique 54 residue insert (crosshatch
pattern) at the n-terminus. the black shaded region represents the
conserved pde11 catalytic domain.

n-terminal truncated forms of pde11a4; the pde11a2
n-terminal sequence begins with the c-terminal 22 residues of gaf-a found in pde11a4, and the remainder of
the sequence is identical to that of pde11a4. pde11a1 has
no gaf-a sequence, and the n-terminus begins with the
last 123 residues of gaf-b found in the other isozymes (8,
10-12).
one or more of the gaf subdomains in the n-terminal
domains of pde2, pde5, and pde6 are involved in highaffinity allosteric cgmp binding and/or dimerization of these
enzymes (14-18). subdomains in the n-terminal region of
the pde4 family also contribute to oligomerization. a study
with a chimeric protein comprising residues 1-568 of the
n-terminal domain of pde11a4 fused with the catalytic
domain of the cyab1 adenylyl cyclase of anabaena has
demonstrated that cgmp specifically stimulates the activity
of the cyclase and implies that cgmp can bind to the
n-terminus of pde11a4, albeit with low affinity (19). on
the basis of the gaf-b sequence of  xxxg1694xxx  and the gaf-a
sequence of  xxxg1701xxx , both of which bind cgmp with high
affinity, a consensus cgmp-binding motif of 11 residues has
been proposed (16). the gaf-a domain of pde11a4 has
different amino acids in 2 of the 11 positions of this motif,
while the gaf-b has different amino acids in 6 of these
positions. whether either gaf subdomain interacts with cn
in an intact  xxxg1691xxx  isozyme has not been demonstrated.
oligomerization of the pde4 family is also mediated by
subdomains in its n-terminal region. the majority of pdes
studied to date behave as oligomers in solution, leading to
the suggestion that oligomerization plays an important, yet
undiscovered, function (20). recently, the oligomeric state
of the pde4 and pde5 family has been shown to influence
regulatory properties and potency of inhibitors, and the
oligomeric states of other enzymes, for example, pkg, are
an important determinant of enzymatic function (20-23).
of the four human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes, several recent reports

roles of pde11 n-termini
lovirus containing his6-tagged pde11a4 holoenzyme was
created as described earlier (5). recombinant baculoviruses
expressing human non-tagged pde11a2 and pde11a3 were
generous gifts from drs. kate loughney and vince florio
(icos corp, bothell, wa). his6-tagged pde11a1 was
created using the human cdna coding for full-length
pde11a4 holoenzyme used as a template with the following
pcr primers to generate pde11a1: forward primer 5′gctcatatgcatgtccccaaagtgcagt-3′ containing
an nde1 site (underlined) and reverse primer 5′gtagtggtaccttagttcctgtcttccttggc-3′ containing a
kpn1 site (underlined) and the stop codon (boldface type)
of the human pde11a4 sequence. this fragment was
digested with nde1 and kpn1 and cloned into the pachlt-a
vector (bd pharmingen) digested by the same enzymes to
yield the baculovirus expression vector, pachlt-a-pde11a1.
the sequence spanning pde11a1 was verified by dna
sequencing (vanderbilt ingram cancer center dna sequencing core, vanderbilt university medical center,
nashville, tn). the expression vector, pachlt-a-pde11a1
was then used to generate a recombinant baculovirus
according to the baculovirus expression vector system
(pharmingen) as described earlier.
expression and purification of human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes.
his6-tagged human pde11a4 was expressed and purified
essentially as described by ni-nta affinity chromatograpy
(5). we have found that the use of 1 m nacl in the lysis
buffer and ni-nta column buffer greatly simplifies obtaining pde11a4 preps that are essentially free from proteolysis
as evidenced by a single immunoreactive species on western
blots and sds-page gels stained with silver stain. recombinant baculoviruses for human pde11a1, pde11a2,
and pde11a3 were subjected to several rounds of amplification to yield high-titer baculovirus. the amount of
baculovirus that yielded the highest pde11 activity was
experimentally determined for each high-titer virus versus
mock-infected cells using the pde activity assay as described
(5).
for expression of pde11a1 or pde11a2, sf9 cells were
grown at 27 °c in either suspension culture at 1 × 106 cells/
ml or in t-175 flasks containing 2 × 107 sf9 cells in grace’s
insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.125 µg/ml  xxxd164xxx , and infected with
the optimum dose of the virus. at 96 h post-infection, sf9
cells were pelleted by centrifugation (5 min at 2000 rpm
in a beckman ja-10 rotor), the medium was removed, and
the cell pellet was washed three times with ice-cold pbs
(1.9 mm nah2po4, 8.1 mm na2hpo4, and 150 mm nacl
at ph 7.4). cells were snap-frozen in liquid n2 and stored
at -80 °c or lysed immediately. the cell pellet from each
flask was lysed on ice for 30 min with 2 ml of lysis buffer
(lb), which contained 10 mm potassium phosphate, 25 mm
 xxxd26xxx , 0.1% triton x-100, roche complete
protease inhibitors, 0.07 µg/ml pepstatin a, 250 µm pmsf
or  xxxd502xxx , 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µm e-64, and 20-40 mm
nacl at a final ph of 6.8. the lysate was centrifuged at 4
°c (25 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm in a beckman ja-20 rotor). the
soluble supernatant was then diluted 1:10 in ice-cold lb
lacking triton x-100 [lb (-t)] and loaded onto a deaesephacel column (0.9 cm × 7.5 cm) that had been equilibrated in the same buffer. several attempts were made to

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 36, 2007 10355
purify pde11a1 using ni-nta resin via the his6-tag on
the vector carrying pde11a1, but the majority of pde11a1
that bound to the ni-nta could not be eluted, even upon
the addition of 1 m imidazole; thus, purification using
deae-sephacel was adopted. after application of the
sample, the column was washed first with 50 ml of lb
(-t). then the column was washed with 1.5 l of lb (-t)
that contained 50 mm nacl without protease inhibitors.
pde11a1 or pde11a2 was eluted from the deae-sephacel
column with a 50-400 mm linear nacl gradient of 72 ml
in lb (-t). fractions containing the highest pde11 activity
were pooled and dialyzed at 4 °c overnight in 2000 volumes
of kpm at ph 6.8 (10 mm potassium phosphate and 25 mm
 xxxd26xxx ), 150 mm nacl, and 10% sucrose and
then snap-frozen in liquid n2. pde activity was not affected
by one freeze/thaw cycle using this freezing protocol. in
some cases, fractions containing the highest pde11a1
activity were pooled, concentrated 2-5-fold with a centricon
ym-30 concentrator, then applied to a sephacryl s-200 gel
filtration column (0.9 cm × 35 cm), and eluted with kpm
containing 150 mm nacl (ph 6.8). pde11a1 eluted prior
to the majority of the total cell protein resulting in a very
effective purification step. fractions from the sephacryl
s-200 column were used immediately or frozen as described
above for pde11a2.
pde11a3 was very sensitive to proteolysis; cleavage was
not effectively blocked despite the presence of multiple
protease inhibitors in the lb. attempts to partially purify
pde11a3 via deae-sephacel chromatography using lb
resulted in preparations that were markedly heterogeneous
on western blots, suggesting that the low ionic strength
required for the protein to bind the resin did not adequately
protect pde11a3 from proteolysis. the following method
was found to be effective in obtaining partially purified
preparations of pde11a3 that were suitable for kinetic and
quaternary structure studies. sf9 cells were grown in suspension flasks as described above and infected with an optimal
amount of high-titer pde11a3 baculovirus for 96 h. infected
cells were then centrifuged (5 min at 2000 rpm in a
beckman ja-20 rotor), and the cell pellet was washed three
times with pbs as described above and either snap-frozen
in liquid n2 or lysed immediately. lysis was carried out for
5 min at 4 °c by repetitively pipetting 2.5 × 108 cells in 5
ml of lb containing 1% triton x-100 and 1 m nacl. this
solution was then centrifuged for 30 min (28,000 rpm in a
beckman type 30 rotor), and the soluble supernatant was
filtered through cheese cloth before applying to a sephacryl
s-200 column (1.7 cm × 90 cm, 125 ml bed volume)
equilibrated in lb (-t) with 1 m nacl, and fractions (1.1
ml) were collected by gravity flow. fractions were assayed
for pde catalytic activity to determine the elution position
of pde11a3, and the identity of pde11a3 was confirmed
by western blotting using the 417l antibody. under these
conditions, pde11a3 began eluting from the column at
approximately 52 ml.
construction, expression and purification of the  xxxg1691xxx 
(met-563 to asn-934) catalytic domain. human his6-tagged
met-563 to asn-934 pde11 catalytic domain was created
using the human cdna for full-length pde11a4 as a
template to generate the met-563 to asn-934 region of
pde11a4 by pcr using the forward primer 5′-gtacatatgtatgatcaagtgaagaagtc-3′ containing an

10356 biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 36, 2007
nde1 site (underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-gtagtctcgagttagttcctgtcttccttg-3′ containing an xhoi
site (underlined) and the stop codon (boldface type) of the
human pde11a4 sequence. the resulting pcr fragment was
digested by nde1 and xho1 and cloned into the pet15b
vector digested with the same enzymes to yield the bacterial
expression vector pet15b-pde11 catalytic domain. the
sequence corresponding to the pde11 catalytic domain was
verified by dna sequencing. (vanderbilt ingram cancer
center dna sequencing facility, vanderbilt university
medical center, nashville, tn).
the pet15b-pde11 catalytic domain construct (120 ng)
was transformed using heat-shock into 50 µl of bl21 (de3)
codonplus ril cells, plated on luria-agar plates with 50
ug/ml ampicillin, and grown overnight. a single colony was
picked and added to 4 ml of luria broth with 100 µg/ml
ampicillin and 20 µg/ml  xxxd1666xxx  (lb-ac) and
grown overnight at 37 °c with shaking (250 rpm). one
milliliter of this mixture was then added to 10 ml of lbac and grown at 37 °c overnight with shaking (250 rpm).
then, 1 ml of this mixture was added to 35 ml of lb-ac
and grown at 37 °c overnight with shaking (250 rpm).
finally, 1 ml of this mixture was added to each of four
erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 1 l of lb-ac with 0.4%
glucose and grown for 5.5 h at 37 °c with shaking (250
rpm). flasks were removed from the incubator, placed on
ice, and incubated at 4 °c for 40 min. flasks were then
transferred to an incubator and incubated at 11 °c for 30
min. after this, cells were induced with a final concentration
of 0.1 mm iptg and shaken at 190 rpm for 14 h at 11 °c.
cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, and cells
from each liter of media were resuspended in 50 ml of
bacterial lysis buffer (blb) at ph 8.0 (20 mm  xxxd3449xxx ,
300 mm nacl, 15 mm imidiazole, 1 mm  xxxd26xxx ,
and roche complete protease inhibitors) with 1 mg/ml
lysozyme type vi and incubated on ice for 50 min. cells
were lysed by sonication using a branson sonifier 450
(branson ultrasonics co., danbury, ct) for 1 min four times,
interspersed by cooling in an ice bath to achieve a cleared
lysate that was centrifuged (20 min at 15,000 rpm in a
beckman ja-20 rotor); the soluble supernatant was saved,
and the pellet was discarded. nickel-nta resin (1.5 ml bed
volume) was then washed with 400 ml of blb, and the
washed resin was added to the soluble supernatant and gently
shaken at 4 °c for 1 h. resin was then added to a small
column (0.9 × 3 cm), washed with 300 ml of blb, and
then washed with 100 ml of blb (ph 8.0) containing 50
mm nacl. protein was eluted in 1 ml fractions using elution
buffer at ph 8.0 (20 mm tris-hcl, 50 mm nacl, 150 mm
imidazole, and 1 mm  xxxd26xxx ). peak protein
fractions were pooled and dialyzed for 48 h against 2000
volumes of 20 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.0), 25 mm  xxxd26xxx , 0.1% triton x-100, 2 mm mgcl2, 150 mm nacl,
and 10% sucrose. aliquots were then snap-frozen in liquid
n2 and stored at -80 °c until use.
gel electrophoresis and western blots of expressed
 xxxg1691xxx  isozymes. pde11 proteins of high purity (pde11a4,
pde11a1, and pde11 catalytic domain) or partially purified
proteins (pde11a2, pde11a3) were assessed by sodium
 xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sdspage) followed by coomassie brilliant blue or silver
staining and western blot analysis. proteins were boiled for

weeks et al.
4 min in the presence of 10% sds, 2 mm  xxxd26xxx ,
and 1% bromophenol blue, followed by 10% sds-page
and then visualized as described above. for western blot,
gels were transferred to pvdf membranes and blots
performed using standard protocols. primary antibodies were
used from 1000-10,000-fold dilutions. secondary antibody
was an anti-mouse conjugated to horse radish peroxidase
from sheep and was used at 1000-to 3000-fold dilutions. histagged pde5 (22) and bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) did not
cross-react with 417l and were used as negative controls
for western blots.
measurement of pde11 catalytic activity. measurement
of michaelis-menten constant (km) for camp or cgmp and
values for ic50 (inhibitor concentration at 50% inhibition)
of inhibitors were determined using the pde catalytic activity
assay as described previously (5). km values of human
 xxxg1691xxx  isozymes for cgmp and camp were determined
using camp and cgmp concentrations from 0.03 to 80 µm.
data for km studies were analyzed by nonlinear regression
with a single site model in graphpad prism (graphpad
software inc., san diego, ca). reactions were experimentally determined to be linear with respect to time (not shown).
for the determination of ic50 values,  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes were
analyzed using cgmp as substrate at a concentration that
was approximately 10 times below the experimentally
determined km. this ensured that the ic50 value obtained
approached the ki (28). data for ic50 studies were plotted
and analyzed with graphpad prism using a sigmoidal dose
response model. elution positions of human  xxxg1691xxx 
isozymes in gel filtration and sucrose gradients were
determined using the pde catalytic activity assay with 300
nm [3h]cgmp as substrate. the elution position of pde11
catalytic domain was also determined by both sds-page,
followed by visualization with coommassie brilliant blue
and western blot analysis using the 417l antibody.
determination of stokes radius of  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes.
pde11a4 (1.9 µg) or partially purified pde11a3 were
combined with either catalase (4 mg) or  xxxg818xxx  (2.5 mg)
and  xxxg569xxx  (0.8 mg) in a final volume of 200 µl and
loaded onto a sephacryl s-300 gel filtration column (0.9 cm
× 35 cm) equilibrated at 4 °c in 10 mm potassium
phosphate, 1 mm edta, 25 mm beta-mercapoethanol, 1 m
nacl at ph 6.8 (kpemhs), and roche complete protease
inhibitors. pde11a3 and pde11a4 were sensitive to proteolysis, which occurred during gel filtration despite the
presence of several protease inhibitors and resulted either
from trace amounts of proteases in the internal protein
standards or from trace amounts of proteases co-purifying
with these proteins. one molar nacl in the gel filtration
buffer was effective at mitigating the proteolysis of pde11a3
and pde11a4. the column was eluted with kpemhs, and
fractions (0.5 ml) were collected.
the sephacryl s-300 column was standardized with
protein standards of known stokes radii:  xxxg569xxx  (16.6
å), ovalbumin (29 å), catalase (52 å), and  xxxg818xxx  (60
å). partially purified pde11a2 or pde11a1 (0.25-2 µg)
was combined with various internal standards, catalase (3
mg), ovalbumin (4 mg),  xxxg818xxx  (2.5 mg),  xxxg569xxx 
(0.8 mg), or soybean  xxxd207xxx  (1.75 mg) in a final
volume of 200 µl and loaded onto a sephacryl s-200 column
(0.9 × 35 cm) equilibrated at 4 °c in kpem at ph 6.8,

inhibitors. the column was eluted with this buffer, and
fractions (0.5 ml) were collected. the sephacryl s-200
column was standardized with protein standards of known
stokes radii:  xxxg818xxx  (60 å),  xxxg569xxx  (16.6 å),
ovalbumin (29 å), catalase (52 å), soybean  xxxd207xxx 
(24.5 å), and pkg ir (55 å). protein standards were
detected by spectrophotometric absorbance at 280 nm or at
411 nm for catalase and  xxxg569xxx . the elution position
of pkg ir was determined by the protein kinase activity
assay as described earlier (23). the elution position of protein
standards was confirmed by sds-page followed by
staining with coomassie brilliant blue and scanning by a
densitometry program (scion image, scion corp.). profiles
generated from spectrophotometric absorbance or densitometry scanning of sds-page gels were in excellent
agreement. the pde11 catalytic domain (65-130 µg) was
combined with two internal standards, bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(1.75 mg) and ovalbumin (1.75 mg) in a final volume of
135 µl in kpem with 150 mm nacl and roche complete
protease inhibitors and applied to a sephadex g-100 column
(0.9 × 35 cm) equilibrated in this same buffer. the column
was eluted with this buffer, and fractions (0.5 ml) were
collected. the sephadex g-100 column was standardized
with protein standards of known stokes radii: soybean
 xxxd207xxx  (24.5 å), bovine  xxxg124xxx  monomer
(35 å), and ovalbumin (29 å). the elution positions of the
internal and external protein standards were determined as
described above. elution positions of  xxxg1691xxx  proteins were
determined by the pde activity assay as described above.
the elution position of pde11 catalytic domain was
determined both by the pde assay (not shown) and by
western blot, with both methods agreeing well. for each gel
filtration column, the thyroglobulin elution volume was taken
as the void volume, and the elution volume of [3h]h2o was
used to determine the inclusion volume. elution positions
of the internal protein standards were used to generate a
standard curve of (-log kav)1/2 versus stokes radius as
follows:

the stokes radii of  xxxg1691xxx  proteins were determined from
the standard curve.
determination of sedimentation coefficients of  xxxg1691xxx 
isozymes. pde11a4 (0.003-1 µg), partially purified
pde11a2 or pde11a3, pde11a1 (10-100 µg), or the
pde11 catalytic domain (3-65 µg) were combined with
internal standards, crystalline phosphorylase b (3 mg) or
catalase (2 mg) and hemoglobin (0.5 mg) in a final volume
of 150-200 µl in kpem with 150 mm nacl and roche
protease inhibitors and applied to a 13-ml linear 5-20%
sucrose gradient of the same buffer, as described previously
(23). the gradients were centrifuged at 37,000 rpm in a
beckman sw 41 ti rotor for 19-44 h at 4 °c, and fractions
(0.5 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tubes.
phosphorylase b has an s20,w value of 8.0 s and was located
by absorbance at 280 nm. catalase has an s20,w value of 11.5
s and was located by absorbance at 280 or 411 nm.
hemoglobin has an s20,w value of 3.2 s and was located by
absorbance at 280 or 411 nm. the pde catalytic activity
using 300 nm [3h]cgmp as substrate was used to determine

the sedimentation position of pde11 isozymes as described
above.
sedimentation coefficients of pde11 proteins were calculated from the distance migrated into the gradients as
compared with those of the standards.
calculation of native molecular weights of  xxxg1691xxx 
isozymes. the native molecular weights (mr) were calculated
from the experimentally determined stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients according to the method of siegel and
monty (29) using the following equation:

expression and purification of human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes.
the four human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes, pde11a1, pde11a2,
pde11a3, and pde11a4 (figure 1), were expressed in sf9
cells using baculovirus expression systems. the pde11
catalytic domain construct (catalytic domain, figure 1) was
expressed in escherichia coli using the pet vector expression system. proteins were purified as described in experimental procedures. pde11a4 and pde11 catalytic domain
were purified by nickel-nta column chromatography
(figure 2a). pde11a1 was purified by deae-sephacel
chromatography followed by sephacryl s-200 gel filtration
(figure 2a). pde11a2 was partially purified using deae
anion-exchange chromatography. pde11a3 was partially
purified by sephacryl s-200 gel filtration in the presence of
1 m nacl. western blots of expressed  xxxg1691xxx  proteins
demonstrated a single immunoreactive species for pde11a4,
pde11a2, pde11a1, and pde11 catalytic domain (figure
2b), the migration of each on sds-page agreed well with
the predicted molecular weight based on amino acid composition (table 2). pde11a3 demonstrated a major species
of approximately 75 kda, which agreed well with the
predicted molecular weight based on amino acid composition
(table 2) and two faint minor species that migrated more
rapidly (figure 2b).
comparison of substrate affinities among pde11 isozymes.
previous work suggested the possibility that the n-terminal
domains of  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes affect inhibitor sensitivities
and maximal velocities (9, 12). therefore, we compared in
a head-to-head manner whether the n-terminal domains
among the human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes influence the affinity
of the pde11 catalytic site for substrates by measuring the
affinities (km) of the respective isozymes, which have
variable natural truncations, for the two substrates, camp
and cgmp. interestingly, pde11 isozymes with marked
truncations in their n-terminal domains (pde11a1 and

pde11a1 (2 ug), or pde11 catalytic domain (6 µg) were mixed
with loading buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed on 10% sdspage (see experimental procedures). pde11a1 and pde11
catalytic domains were detected by coomassie brilliant blue stain,
and pde11a4 was detected by silver stain. (b) western blot of
expressed human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes and the pde11 catalytic

partially purified pde11a3 and pde11a2 were subjected to 10%
sds-page and transferred to pvdf membranes. bovine serum
albumin (bsa) (1 µg) and purified human pde type 5a1
(pde5a1) (1 µg) were included as negative controls. western blots
were performed according to standard protocols using the monoclonal anti- xxxg1691xxx  antibody, 417l, at a dilution of 1:8333 and a
dilution of 1:3000 for the secondary antibody. the blot was revealed
using the western lightning chemiluminesence kit.

pde11a2) displayed significantly (***p < 0.001) higher
affinity (km) for camp (3.3-3.5-fold) and cgmp (2.5-2.9fold) when compared directly to that of pde11a4 (table
1). km values of pde11a3 for cgmp and camp were
intermediate between those of pde11a4 and the shorter

weeks et al.
isoforms pde11a1 and pde11a2. although the affinities
of pde11a3 for substrates were significantly (*p < 0.05)
lower for cgmp (2-2.3-fold) and camp (1.7-1.8-fold)
when compared to pde11a1 and pde11a2, this decrease
in substrate affinity was not as pronounced as that of
pde11a4. as aforementioned, we found pde11a3 to be
very sensitive to proteolysis, necessitating partial purification
by gel filtration under high ionic strength conditions. to
further validate the km determined for pde11a3 partially
purified by gel filtration, the km for pde11a3 was determined using the crude supernatant immediately after lysis
of pde11a3-expressing sf9 cells. pde11a3 baculovirusinfected cells were lysed and centrifuged as described in
experimental procedures. uninfected cells were used as
control to determine an appropriate dilution at which
supernatant from control cells did not lead to significant
hydrolysis of substrate over the blank during the assay. using
this approach, the km of pde11a3 from freshly lysed cells
was determined to be 0.77 ( 0.01 µm for camp (n ) 2),
which agreed well with the km (0.80 ( 0.01 µm) using
camp as substrate from multiple experiments conducted on
pde11a3 partially purified by gel filtration (table 1).
western blot of freshly lysed pde11a3 cells demonstrated
a single immunoreactive species (not shown), which corresponded to the major band in pde11a3 preparations
(figure 2b) partially purified by gel filtration.
comparison of inhibitor affinities among pde11 isozymes.
the catalytic sites of  xxxg1691xxx  and  xxxg1701xxx  share the highest
sequence identity (51%) within the mammalian pde superfamily, and moderate cross-reaction between some commercially available pde5 inhibitors and  xxxg1691xxx  has been
reported (5). to address whether differences in n-terminal
domains of  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes affect inhibitor potency and
therefore selectivity of inhibitors for pde5 versus pde11,
we determined ic50 values for two structurally different
inhibitors, tadalafil and vardenafil, and compared these in a
head-to-head manner among the four human  xxxg1691xxx 
isozymes (figure 3 and table 1). under the conditions used,
the ic50 of tadalafil for pde11a4 was 73 ( 3.1 nm; this
was significantly (***p < 0.001) less potent (3.5-4.9-fold)
than the ic50 values determined for pde11a2 or pde11a1
of 21 ( 2.3 nm and 15 ( 1.5 nm, respectively. interestingly,
pde11a3 also displayed a significant (***p < 0.001) and
comparable increase in tadalafil potency of 3.8-fold over
pde11a4, with an ic50 of 19 ( 3.2 nm (figure 3a and
table 1). given the sensitivity of pde11a3 to proteolysis,
we determined the tadalafil ic50 from freshly lysed pde11a3
baculovirus infected sf9 cells to be 14 nm (n ) 1), a value
that agreed well with the value of 19 ( 3.2 nm from multiple
experiments on pde11a3 partially purified by gel filtration
(table 1). the potency of vardenafil, a pde5 inhibitor that
is structurally unrelated to tadalafil, for all human  xxxg1691xxx 
isozymes was also determined in a head-to-head manner. the
ic50 of vardenafil was 650 ( 55 nm for pde11a4, which
was significantly (***p < 0.001) less potent (3.9-4.3-fold)
than the ic50 values determined for pde11a3 (151 ( 11
nm), pde11a2 (166 ( 12 nm), and pde11a1 (163 ( 10
nm) (figure 3b and table 1). fold differences in the potency
of vardenafil between pde11a4 and pde11a1, and 11a2
and 11a3 agreed well with those determined for tadalafil.
the vardenafil ic50 values determined here for pde11a4
and pde11a1 were in good agreement with that for

physical properties of human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes. most
mammalian pdes that have been studied for quaternary
structure are oligomeric, with the majority demonstrating a
dimeric structure. gaf subdomains in the n-termini of
pde2, 5 and 6, provide important dimerization contacts in
these enzymes. three  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes contain one or more
complete gafs (figure 1), but no function has been defined

for these in intact  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes, nor has the quaternary
structure of any pde11 isozyme been delineated. to
investigate the quaternary structures of human  xxxg1691xxx 
isozymes and the potential effects of  xxxg1691xxx  n-terminal
domains on structure, we determined the quaternary structures of the four human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes as well as an
n-terminal truncation mutant of pde11a1 (pde11 catalytic
domain). physical characteristics of human  xxxg1691xxx  proteins
are summarized in table 2. stokes radii of human  xxxg1691xxx 
proteins were determined by gel filtration chromatography
as described in experimental procedures. pde11a4 and
pde11a3 were each chromatographed on a sephacryl s-300
column and both eluted between the internal standards
 xxxg818xxx  (60 å) and  xxxg569xxx  (16.6 å) with stokes
radii of 57.8 å for pde11a4 (figure 4a, table 2) and 56.1
å for pde11a3 (figure 4b, table 2). on sephacryl s-200
gel filtration chromatography, pde11a2 essentially coeluted
with the internal standard catalase with a stokes radius of
52 å (figure 4c, table 2). interestingly, on sephacryl s-200
gel filtration, pde11a1 essentially coeluted with the internal
standard  xxxg818xxx  with a stokes radius of 60 å (fig, 4d,
table 2); this value was higher than that of pde11a2,
pde11a3, or pde11a4 despite pde11a1 having the lowest
predicted subunit molecular weight of the four isozymes. the
pde11 catalytic domain was chromatographed on both a
sephadex g-100 and sephacryl s-100 gel filtration column
along with internal standards bovine  xxxg124xxx  monomer (35 å), ovalbumin (29 å), soybean  xxxd207xxx 
(24.5 å), and  xxxg569xxx  (16.6 å). the stokes radius of
the pde11 catalytic domain determined in this manner was
30 å (table 2), and the elution position was detected both
by western blot analysis (figure 5a) and the pde activity
assay (not shown), with both methods agreeing well.

figure 4: gel filtration of human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes. human pde11 proteins were combined with the indicated protein standards and
subjected to gel filtration chromatography as described in experimental procedures. sephacryl s-300 column chromatography was used for

fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and assayed for pde activity as described in experimental procedures. protein standards were detected
by spectrophotometric absorbance at 280 nm or 411 nm, and peaks were confirmed by 10% sds-page followed by coomassie brilliant
blue staining. the results are representative of three or more separate experiments, each of which was assayed in triplicate.

sedimentation coefficients (s-values) of human  xxxg1691xxx 
isozymes (table 2). pde11a4 and pde11a3 sedimented
between catalase (11.5 s) and hemoglobin (3.2 s) with
calculated sedimentation coefficients of 7.9 and 6.0 s,
respectively (figure 6a and b, table 2). pde11a2 sedimented between phosphorylase b (8.0 s) and hemoglobin
(3.2 s) with a calculated sedimentation coeffecient of 5.2 s
(figure 6c, table 2). suprisingly, pde11a1 sedimented
faster than phosphorylase b (8.0 s), and when centrifuged
in the presence of catalase (11.5 s) and hemoglobin (3.2 s),
the s-value of pde11a1 was determined to be 8.8 s (figure
6d, table 2). the pde11 catalytic domain demonstrated
heterogeneity in sucrose gradients with a 4.0 s component
and a heavier component of 6.1 s. (figure 5b, table 2).
when the concentration of the pde11 catalytic domain
applied to the gradients was decreased from 10 µm (figure
5b) to 2.5 µm (figure 5c), the pde activity shifted mainly
to the lighter component, suggesting that the two components
were in equilibrium and that the lower concentration favored
the formation of the lighter component. both peaks were
inhibited by tadalafil and could be visualized on western blots
using the 417l antibody (not shown). the profile generated
from the pde activity assay in figures 5b and 5c agreed
well with that in which the elution position of pde11
catalytic domain was determined by western blot or sdspage followed by staining with coomassie brilliant blue
or silver stain (not shown). to estimate the ratio of each
component in the gradients containing 10 µm and 2.5 µm
pde11 catalytic domain, we determined the area under the
curve (auc) as described earlier (31). auc determination
based on the pde activity profile from multiple sucrose
gradients demonstrated that when 10 µm pde11 catalytic
domain (figure 5b) was applied to the gradients the two
components were present at an approximate ratio of 1:1.
when the concentration of the pde11 catalytic domain

applied to the gradients was reduced to 2.5 µm, the ratio
shifted to 4-fold, with the lighter component predominating
(figure 5c). when 0.5 µm pde11 catalytic domain was
applied, the protein sedimented almost exclusively as the
apparent monomeric component when detected by western
blot using the 417l antibody (not shown), which suggested that the dimeric component had dissociated into the
monomer.
the quaternary structure of human  xxxg1691xxx  proteins was
calculated according to the method of siegel and monty (see
experimental procedures), which utilizes both the experimentally determined stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient to calculate native molecular weight (29). the
quaternary structure can then be assigned on the basis of
the comparison with the molecular weight of the subunit
predicted from amino acid composition. the calculated native
molecular weights of pde11a4 (190 kda), pde11a3 (140
kda), and pde11a2 (110 kda) were approximately double
their predicted molecular weights based on amino acid
sequence (table 2) and migration on sds-page (figure
2b); these values were therefore consistent with a dimeric
quaternary structure. interestingly, the native molecular
weight of pde11a1 was 220 kda, which was consistent with
a tetrameric quaternary structure. the pde11 catalytic
domain construct was assigned a monomer/dimer quaternary
structure, with a monomeric 49-kda component having a
molecular weight similar to that determined by sds-page,
predicted amino acid molecular weight, and a second dimeric
component of 76 kda (table 2).
in order to estimate the concentrations of pde11 isozymes
in quaternary structure studies and arrive at a minimum
estimate of the affinity of oligomerization, we determined
the specific activities of purified pde11a4, pde11a1, and
pde11 catalytic domain. on the basis of protein determination by bradford assay, the specific activity of pde11a4

roles of pde11 n-termini

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 36, 2007 10361
of enzyme concentration based on the specific activity of
pde11a4 revealed that this isozyme remained dimeric at
3.3 pm on sucrose gradients (figure 6a), indicating that the
kd for dimerization was less than 3 pm. by gel filtration
chromatography, pde11a1 remained tetrameric at 3.3 nm
(figure 4d), indicating that the kd for oligomerization was
less than 3.3 nm. similarly, sucrose gradients of pde11a1
revealed that the enzyme remained oligomeric at low
nanmolar (18.4 nm) concentrations (figure 6d). in contrast
to pde11a4 and pde11a1, the pde11 catalytic domain
segregated in sucrose gradients into monomeric and dimeric
species at much higher concentrations of 1.0 and 0.7 µm,
respectively (figure 5b). assuming that these two species
represent the monomeric and dimeric forms in equilibrium,
it can be concluded that the kd for dimerization in the pde11
catalytic domain is in this range of 0.7-1.0 µm.

g-100 gel filtration of 10 µm pde11 catalytic domain in the
presence of two internal standards, bovine  xxxg124xxx  monomer

catalytic domain was detected by western blotting with the 417l
antibody (see western blot insert at top of figure) and confirmed
by sds-page, followed by staining with coomassie brilliant
blue stain, which agreed well with the elution position determined
by the pde activity assay (not shown). sucrose gradients were
performed as described in experimental procedures. sucrose
gradient centrifugation of the pde11 catalytic domain (panels b
and c) was conducted in the presence of two internal standards,
phosphorylase b (8 s) and hemoglobin (3.2 s). the concentration
of pde11 catalytic domain in the applied sample was 10 µm for
panel b and 2.5 µm for panel c. the results are representative of
three separate experiments, each of which was assayed in triplicate.

was estimated to be 0.29 µmol/min/mg for cgmp (kcat of
0.51 s-1 for cgmp) and 2-10-fold higher for camp. when
the specific activity of pde11a1 was estimated in the same
manner, the value obtained was 0.0058 µmol/min/mg for
cgmp (kcat of 0.0054 s-1 for cgmp) and 1.6-fold higher for
camp. the specific activities reported here as well as the
substantial difference in specific activity between pde11a4
and pde11a1 agree with previous reports using the partially
purified enzymes (9, 11, 12). the pde11 catalytic domain
construct showed no preference for either camp or cgmp,
with estimated specific activities of 0.00026 µmol/min/mg
for both camp and cgmp (kcat of 0.00019 s-1). estimates

the work presented herein is the first to demonstrate
differences in the affinities of the four naturally occurring
pde11 isozymes for both substrates and inhibitors. on the
basis of comparisons of the affinity for either camp or
cgmp of pde11a4 with that of the naturally occurring
truncated isozymes, pde11a1 and pde11a2, it has been
found that residues 1-358 of pde11a4 have an inhibitory
effect on substrate affinity. the results of studies using two
structurally unrelated inhibitors, tadalafil and vardenafil,
demonstrate that the presence of a similar inhibitory region
of pde11a4 (residues 1-304) also decreases the potency
of these inhibitors with respect to pde11a3, pde11a2, and
pde11a1, in which this region is absent.
the substantial difference in specific enzyme activity
between pde11a4 and pde11a1 that we observe has been
described in a previous report (12); taken together, these data
suggest that the n-terminal 444 residues of pde11a4 may
contain a region that is required for full catalytic activity. it
is unlikely that this difference results from misfolding or
other perturbations of the pde11a1 catalytic site since the
affinities for substrate and several inhibitors are actually
improved when compared directly to those of pde11a4.
with respect to other pdes, the deletion of large parts of
the n-terminal domains of pde1, pde2, and pde5 does
not significantly change the specific enzyme activity relative
to wild type, while reports suggest that n-terminal truncations
in  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 actually increase specific enzyme activity
(32-38). it is unknown whether the 28-45-fold difference
in kcat using cgmp or camp as substrate that is observed
between pde11a1 and the pde11 catalytic domain is due
to further truncation of the n-terminal domain or to different
expression and purification procedures. when the ic50 of
tadalafil for the pde11 catalytic domain is determined using
cgmp as substrate, the value obtained from three separate
experiments is 27 ( 3.6 nm, which agrees well with values
obtained from the  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes other than pde11a4
(table 1) and suggests that the catalytic site is intact as
determined by tadalafil inhibition. however, caution is
suggested when comparing the specific activity and inhibitor
potency between the catalytic domain and pde11a1pde11a4 since expression and purification procedures were
different.
these studies are the first to investigate the quaternary
structure of any pde11 isozyme and provide new insights

figure 6: sucrose density centrifugation of human  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes. pde11a4 (panel a), pde11a3 (panel b), pde11a2 (panel c),
and pde11a1 (panel d) were subjected to sucrose density centrifugation (5-20%) as described in experimental procedures. protein standards,
catalase (2 mg) or crystalline phosphorylase b (3 mg), and hemoglobin (0.5 mg) were run in each gradient as internal controls. following
centrifugation, fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and the elution positions of  xxxg1691xxx  proteins were determined by the pde activity assay
as described in experimental procedures. protein standards were determined by spectrophotometric absorbance at 280 nm or 411 nm, and
peaks were further verified by 10% sds-page followed by coomassie brilliant blue staining. the results are representative of at least
three experiments, each of which was assayed in triplicate.

about oligomerization contacts in this pde family. first,
 xxxg1691xxx  isozymes with truncations in gaf-a (pde11a3
and pde11a2) or the complete absence of gaf-a
(pde11a1) are oligomers, indicating that gaf-a is not
required for the formation of oligomers in human  xxxg1691xxx 
isozymes. while not required for oligomerization, a contribution of gaf-a to the affinity of oligomerization, as occurs
in pde5 (17), cannot be excluded. second, our data suggest
that oligomerization of  xxxg1691xxx  isozymes is due to highaffinity (kd < 3 pm) interactions since the sedimentation
coefficient of pde11a4 is unchanged at concentrations in
the low picomolar (3 pm) range, which agrees well with
our previous studies on the affinity of the dimerization of
pde5 constructs (17). the shortest isoform, pde11a1, is
oligomeric at low (3.3 nm) concentrations during gel
filtration, indicating that the c-terminal 123 amino acids of
gaf-b are sufficient to mediate high-affinity (kd < 3.3 nm)
oligomerization. however, a contribution of the intervening
sequence, between the gafs or within the gaf-b region,
on the affinity of oligomerization cannot be excluded. results
of studies on the pde11 catalytic domain are consistent with
the possibility of low-affinity oligomerization contacts within
this construct (residues 563-934 of human pde11a4) but
suggest that the main oligomerization contacts reside within
the n-terminal domains of pde11 isozymes. the isolated
catalytic domains of several pdes (pde1,  xxxg1695xxx , pde4, and
pde9) are oligomeric in their respective crystal structures
(36, 39-41), while the catalytic domain of pde5 exists as
a monomer in both solution and crystal structures (36, 37).
the oligomerization state of several pdes as well as that
of many other enzyme families has been shown to affect
regulatory mechanisms and sensitivity to ligands, providing
a rationale for the investigation of the relationship of
oligomeric structure and catalytic function in pde11 isozymes.

the pde4 family consists of long and short forms that differ
in the length of an n-terminal domain; the short forms are
monomers, while the long forms are oligomers. in the pde4
family, the oligomeric state has been shown to have important functional consequences, whereas the short monomeric forms lack certain forms of regulation and show
decreased potency for certain inhibitors but retain similar
affinities for the substrate, camp (21). in solution, pde5
exists as a homodimer composed of two subunits of
approximately 100 kda. dimerization in pde5 occurs
exclusively within the n-terminal domain, and a construct
containing only the pde5 catalytic domain exists as a
monomer both in solution studies and in x-ray crystallographic studies (17, 22, 36, 37). interestingly, the monomeric pde5 catalytic domain domain shows substantially
decreased potency for vardenafil while retaining the affinity
of the holoenzyme for the substrate, cgmp, or other classes
of inhibitors (22). in pkg ibeta, dimerization is an important
regulatory feature and increases affinity for allosteric cgmp
binding and activation of the enzyme (23). it is of interest
to note that the catalytic effects (described herein) resulting
from the naturally truncated isozymes of pde11 are apparently not the result of clear differences in their oligomeric
state since pde11a2 (dimeric) and pde11a1 (tetrameric)
both show increased affinity for substrate and inhibitors when
compared to that shown by pde11a4 (dimeric). furthermore, the pde11 catalytic domain at higher concentrations
exists as a monomer/dimer yet still retains the increased
affinity for tadalafil that is seen with pde11a3, pde11a2,
and pde11a1. at least two possibilities can account for
these differences: first, an n-terminal region of pde11a4
that is absent in shorter isozymes may cause a structural
change that is transduced to the catalytic domain, and second,
this n-terminal region of pde11a4 may have a direct

roles of pde11 n-termini
physical interaction with the catalytic domain. the lowering
of ligand affinity of the catalytic site by elements within the
n-terminal region of pde11a4 is consistent with the
presence of an inhibitory subdomain in this region. this
inhibition could be relieved by modulatory effects such as
allosterism (19) or covalent modifications, although such
mechanisms have yet to be demonstrated in intact pde11
isozymes.
as aforementioned, the catalytic site of pde11 is most
closely related to the catalytic site of pde5. since the
biochemical characteristics and physiological roles of pde11
isozymes are not well understood (5), cross-reaction of
pde11 isozymes with commercially available pde5 inhibitors (5, 42-44), such as tadalafil, has been a concern. a
tadalafil pde5/pde11 selectivity ratio of 5-fold using
pde11a1 has been reported (30), whereas we have reported
that this is 41-fold when comparing pde5 and pde11a4
(5). this higher selectivity ratio makes significant crossreaction of tadalafil with pde11a4 less likely. recently, two
independent reports have demonstrated that pde11a4 is the
most readily detected pde11 isozyme in human tissues (24,
25). the present study provides the first direct pharmacological comparison of the potency of tadalafil (and vardenafil)
for all human pde11 isozymes and demonstrates that the
fold-selectivity of these widely distributed pde5 inhibitors
for pde5 versus pde11 depends on the particular isozyme
of pde11 that is considered (table 1).
in conclusion, the results presented herein demonstrate the
importance of the n-terminal domains of human  xxxg1691xxx 
isozymes not only for quaternary structure but also for
influencing the affinity for substrate as well as potency and
selectivity of inhibitors. this emphasizes the importance of
evaluating affinity for substrates and inhibitors in the context
of varied n-terminal domains within the pde11 family.
