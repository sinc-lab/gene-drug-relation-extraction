effects of  xxxd2098xxx  on beta-adrenoceptor and  xxxg448xxx  function in bovine tracheal smooth muscle.  prolonged (18 h) incubation of isolated bovine tracheal smooth muscle with the  xxxg92xxx  agonist  xxxd2098xxx  (10 microm) induced desensitization of  xxxd2398xxx -induced adenylyl cyclase activity in bovine tracheal smooth muscle membranes, characterized by a 25% decrease in maximal effect (emax) (p < 0.05), while the sensitivity to the agonist (pec50) was unchanged. the emax value of  xxxd2398xxx -induced smooth muscle relaxation of submaximal  xxxd2586xxx -induced contractile tones was similarly reduced by about 25% (p < 0.001), while the pec50 value was diminished by 1.0 log unit (p < 0.001). as determined by 30 microm  xxxd2174xxx -induced  xxxg448xxx  antagonism and pertussis toxin-induced inactivation of g(i alpha),  xxxg448xxx -mediated functional antagonism did not play a role in  xxxd2398xxx -induced relaxation of bovine tracheal smooth muscle contracted by  xxxd2586xxx , both in control and in 18-h  xxxd2098xxx -treated tissue. in line with these observations, we found no enhanced  xxxg448xxx -mediated inhibition of 1 microm  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity after 18-h  xxxd2098xxx  treatment. these data indicate that 18-h  xxxd2098xxx  treatment of bovine tracheal smooth muscle induces  xxxg92xxx  desensitization and reduced functional antagonism of  xxxd2586xxx -induced contraction by beta-adrenoceptor agonists, without a change of  xxxg448xxx  function.
