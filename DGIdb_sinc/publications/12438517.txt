the lack of ␣2-adrenoceptor (ar) subtype-selective antagonists has precluded clarification of the role of each subtype
in various physiological and behavioral studies (macdonald
et al., 1997). homologous recombination strategies that lead
either to gene knockouts or a substitution of a mutant receptor at the wild-type locus in the mouse genome have been
developed. using genetically engineered mouse strains it has
been suggested that the ␣2c-ar subtype has a distinct inhibitory role in the processing of sensory information and in the
control of motor and emotion-related activities in the central
nervous system (scheinin et al., 2001). it is therefore possible
that ␣2c-ar-selective drugs may have therapeutic value in
the treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders. in addition to the central nervous system effects associated with
␣2c-ar, a remarkable role of ␣2c-ar in vascular dysfunction
has recently been discovered. the cold-induced cutaneous

n ⫽ 2, 3, 4, 18, and 24 exhibited selectivity for the ␣2c-adrenoceptor. the yohimbine dimers n ⫽ 3 and n ⫽ 24 showed the
highest potency and selectivity (32- and 82-fold. respectively)
for the ␣2c-adrenoceptor in receptor binding and in functional
studies (42- and 29-fold, respectively) measuring camp
changes using a cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay. the
dimers (n ⫽ 3 and n ⫽ 24) had high selectivity (⬎1000-fold) for
the ␣2c–adrenoceptor compared with the three ␣1-adrenoceptor subtypes. these findings demonstrate that the addition of
spacer linkages to bivalent yohimbine molecules provides a
successful approach to the development of ligands that are
potent and highly selective for the ␣2c-adrenoceptor.

arterial blood vessel constriction observed in raynaud’s disease may be linked to increased reactivity of smooth muscle
␣2c-ar. ␣2c-ars are not functionally responsive at 37°c, i.e.,
silent in normal regulation of the vascular function, but are
activated by catecholamines at 28°c (chotani et al., 2000).
thus, selective blockade of these receptors by using ␣2c-arselective antagonists may provide a new therapeutic intervention for the treatment of raynaud’s disease. findings
from cardiovascular studies using ␣2a-, ␣2b-, and ␣2c-ar
knockout mice indicated that although the peripheral ␣2aand ␣2b-ar modulate blood pressure, the ␣2c-ar does not
play a measurable role in the control of systemic blood pressure (macdonald et al., 1997). this finding is consistent with
the notion that an ␣2c-ar-selective drug may offer beneficial
clinical uses with a minimal potential for systemic blood
pressure effects (rizzo et al., 2001). ␣2c-ar subtype-selective
antagonists will help to further elucidate the physiological
roles of this receptor and may provide leads for a variety of
therapeutic disorders.

and selective human ␣2c-ar antagonists using the bivalent

abstract
yohimbine is a potent and selective ␣2- versus ␣1-adrenoceptor antagonist. to date, drugs with high specificity for the
␣2-adrenoceptor show marginal selectivity among the three
␣2-adrenoceptor subtypes. initial studies showed that yohimbine was about 4- and 15-fold more selective for the human
␣2c-adrenoceptor in comparison with the ␣2a- and ␣2b-adrenoceptors, respectively. to improve on this ␣2-adrenoceptor
subtype selectivity, a series of yohimbine dimers (varying from
n ⫽ 2 to 24 spacer atoms) were prepared and evaluated for
receptor binding on human ␣2-adrenoceptor subtypes expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells. each dimeric analog
showed higher affinities for ␣2a- and ␣2c-adrenoceptor versus
the ␣2b-adrenoceptor; and yohimbine dimers with spacers of

sources of materials. all cell culture reagents were obtained
from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca). human ␣2a-, ␣2b-, and ␣2c-ar subtypes expressed in cho cells were obtained from drs. marc caron
and robert lefkowitz (duke university medical center, durham,
nc) and dr. stephen liggett (college of medicine, university of
cincinnati, cincinnati, oh). human ␣1a-, ␣1b-, and ␣1d-ar subtypes
expressed in hek cells were obtained from dr. kenneth minneman
(department of pharmacology, emory university school of medicine,
atlanta, ga). mk-912 was obtained from merck (rahway, nj). yohimbine dimers (fig. 1) were provided by dr. duane d. miller (department of pharmaceutical sciences, university of tennessee,
memphis, tn). the yohimbine dimers (n ⫽ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9) were
prepared as diamides by coupling the commercially available yohimbinic acid with aliphatic ␣,␻-diamines under standard peptide coupling condition (zheng et al., 2000). the procedures for the synthesis
of the  xxxd149xxx  derivatives (n ⫽ 18 and n ⫽ 24) are as described
by zheng (1999). all the yohimbine dimers were hygroscopic and
light-sensitive, and dimers, with the exception of n ⫽ 18 and n ⫽ 24,
were provided as dihydrochloride salts and were soluble in water.
the dimers n ⫽ 18 and n ⫽ 24, prepared as  xxxd149xxx  derivatives
and supplied as the free base, were dissolved in a 1:5 mixture of
 xxxd1896xxx /water. stock solutions of 10 mm were prepared
and diluted in water to appropriate concentrations for these studies.
samples and drug solutions were protected from light. [3h]rauwolscine and [3h] xxxd3000xxx  were obtained from perkinelmer life sciences (boston, ma). all other chemicals were obtained from sigmaaldrich (st. louis, mo).
cell culture. cho cells stably expressing human ␣2a-, ␣2b-, and
␣2c-ar subtypes were grown in 150-cm2 corning flasks with ham’s
f-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm
glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin 100 ␮g/ml).
the flasks were incubated at 37°c (5% co2). media were changed
every 48 h until the cells were confluent. upon confluence, the cells
were detached by addition of 0.05% trypsin edta for 3 to 5 min.
hek cells stably expressing human ␣1a-, ␣1b-, and ␣1d-ar subtypes were grown in 150-cm2 corning flasks with dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2
mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin.

the flasks were incubated at 37°c (5% co2). media were changed
every 48 h until the cells were confluent. upon confluence, the cells
were detached by gentle scraping.
radioligand binding assays. radioligand binding studies were
performed in cho cells expressing human ␣2a-, ␣2b-, and ␣2c-ar
subtypes and hek cells expressing human ␣1a-, ␣1b-, and ␣1d-ar
subtypes. the detached cells were washed and centrifuged with
tris-edta buffer, ph 7.4, in which they were finally suspended. the
competition binding assays were performed in duplicate by incubating 50,000 cells with [3h]rauwolscine and [3h] xxxd3000xxx  for the ␣2and ␣1-ars, respectively, and varying concentrations of the compounds under investigation for 1 h in a water bath at 37°c. nonspecific binding was defined by addition of 10 ␮m yohimbine and 10 ␮m
 xxxd2914xxx  for the ␣2- and ␣1-ars, respectively. cell suspensions
were filtered using gf/b glass fiber filters (whatman, maidstone,
uk) using a cell harvester (model 12-r; brandel inc., gaithersburg,
md). the filter discs were washed three times with 5 ml of trisedta buffer, ph 7.4, at 4°c. the radioactivity was determined using
a tricarb 2900tr liquid scintillation counter (packard instrument
company, inc., downers grove, il). the displacement curves were
generated using graphpad prism software (graphpad software, san
diego, ca). the displacement curves were plotted using a standard
slope factor of 1.0; and the ki values of the competing ligands were
determined using the equation of cheng and prusoff (1973). the
percentage of specific binding was determined by dividing the difference between total bound (dpm) and nonspecific bound (dpm) by the
total bound (dpm).

ligand approach. the term bivalent ligand (or pharmacophore dimer) is defined as a molecule that contains two pharmacophores linked through a spacer. this approach to receptor ligand design would be predicted to generate ligands that
exhibit a potency that is greater than that derived from the
sum of its two monovalent counterparts. the design relies on
the concept that a bivalent ligand should first undergo univalent binding, followed by the binding of the second pharmacophore to a recognition site on a neighboring receptor
(portoghese, 2001). here, we selected the bivalent pharmacophore of yohimbine because this compound is a selective
and potent ␣2-ar antagonist (bylund, 1985). the yohimbine
dimers used were evaluated on human ␣2a-, ␣2b-, and
␣2c-ar subtypes expressed stably in chinese hamster ovary
(cho) cells using a radioligand binding assay. selective yohimbine dimers were also evaluated for binding affinities on
human ␣1a-, ␣1b-, and ␣1d-ar subtypes expressed stably in
human embryonic kidney (hek) cells. finally, cell systems
containing cdna clones of the ␣2-ars, were used to assay
agonist and antagonist agents using a cre reporter gene
functional assay. our approach was to evaluate changes in
luciferase activities, as an index of camp accumulations, for
highly selective yohimbine dimers on human ␣2-ar subtypes
expressed in cho cells.

14- and 3-fold more selective for the ␣2c-ar compared with
the ␣2a- and ␣2b-ar, respectively (table 1). displacement

analogs, with the exception of the dimer (n ⫽ 7) on the

yohimbine on the three ␣2-ar subtypes. however, the
dimeric analogs show much higher affinities for the ␣2a- and

on these ar subtypes agree very favorably with published reports

 xxxd1773xxx  response element-luciferase reporter gene
assay. the functional responses of the yohimbine analogs in these
␣2-ar subtypes were determined with the use of six copies of a camp
response element-luciferase reporter gene construct (6 cre-luc,
padneo2-c6-bgl) provided by dr. a. himmler (boehringer ingelheim research and demonstration, vienna, austria) by the same
transfection procedures described previously in cho cells (vansal
and feller, 1999). the antagonist effects of yohimbine and the two
highly selective bivalent analogs (n ⫽ 3 and n ⫽ 24) were examined
for their concentration-dependent reversal of medetomidine on  xxxd1742xxx -induced camp levels, as assessed by luciferase activity
changes in cho cells expressing the human ␣2a- and ␣2c-ar subtypes. the compounds were tested under the following conditions:
the 6 cre-luc plasmid (5 ␮g/100 ␮l of cell suspension) was transiently transfected into cho cells expressing the ␣2a- and ␣2c-ar
subtypes using electroporation, at 150 v, 70 ms, single pulse. the
transfected cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/200 ␮l/well
in a 96-well microtiter plate and allowed to grow for 20 h. the
compounds under investigation for agonist activity were added directly to the medium and allowed to incubate for 4 h. when tested for
antagonist activity, the compounds were added at varying concentrations 20 min before addition of a fixed concentration of medetomidine (10 nm). subsequently, the media were aspirated, the cells
lysed, and the luciferase activity determined using a topcount
(packard bioscience, meriden, ct) luminometer after adding luciferin. data were analyzed using graphpad prism software and expressed as a mean ⫾ s.e.m. the response produced by 5 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx  in each experiment was used as 100%.
data accumulation and statistical analyses. for ligand binding studies in cell lines, varying concentrations of each drug/ligand
(ranging from 10⫺4–10⫺11 m) were added in duplicate within each
experiment, and the individual molar ic50 values were determined
using graphpad prism. the ki values of each ligand were determined according to the equation described by cheng and prusoff
(1973), and final data are presented as pki ⫾ s.e.m. of n ⱖ 4
experiments. the concentration-dependent reversal of medetomidine
actions on luciferase activity changes in cho cells by yohimbine and
dimers (n ⫽ 3 and n ⫽ 24) were determined as molar ec50 and
negative log molar effective concentration-50 (pec50) values ⫾
s.e.m. of n ⫽ 3 to 4 experiments. differences of means of binding
affinities and functional responses for individual ligands on the ar

midine action against  xxxd1742xxx -induced camp are presented in table 3. the results show that yohimbine and the
two bivalent analogs were able to reverse the effect of
medetomidine on the ␣2c-ar at lower concentrations than
those required for reversal on the ␣2a-ar. yohimbine, and
its bivalent analogs, n ⫽ 3 and n ⫽ 24, were 10-, 42-, and
29-fold more potent at reversing the action of medetomidine on the ␣2c- versus the ␣2a-ar subtype, respectively.
although the fold differences between the ␣2a- and ␣2c-ar
for these analogs are not equal in functional versus binding assays, the data of these functional studies show the
same trend as binding affinities observed with these drugs
on these two ␣2-ar subtypes. subtle differences between
binding and functional results may arise and could be due
to differences in receptor density for the two subtypes used
for the study. nevertheless the data indicate that these
bivalent yohimbine dimers are highly selective ␣2c-ar
antagonists.

n ⫽ 3 and n ⫽ 24 are shown in fig. 3. compared with
yohimbine the binding displacements curves for the selective
dimers n ⫽ 3 and n ⫽ 24 are shifted to the right, especially for
␣2a- and ␣2b-ar subtypes. the yohimbine dimers (n ⫽ 2, n ⫽

than their binding to the ␣2a- and ␣2b-ar subtypes, respectively (table 1).
the binding affinities of yohimbine and the two bivalent
selective analogs (n ⫽ 3 and n ⫽ 24) were determined in hek
cells expressing human ␣1a-, ␣1b-, and ␣1d-ar subtypes to
establish the ␣2- versus ␣1-ar subtype selectivity of these
analogs. the data given in table 2 demonstrate that yohimbine and its two bivalent analogs bind with a low affinity to
the three ␣1-ar subtypes. the binding affinities of yohimbine
and the n ⫽ 3 and n ⫽ 24 dimers for the ␣2c-ar subtype were
at least 4400-, 1000-, and 2450-fold greater than those on the
␣1-ar subtypes, respectively (tables 1 and 2). these findings
confirm the binding selectivity of these ligands for the

gene assay. luciferase reporter gene assay experiments
were conducted by adding a fixed concentration of medetomidine (10 nm) to block the camp-induced increases by 5 ␮m

produced at least a 50% inhibition of the  xxxd1742xxx  response
in the ␣2c-ar subtype expressing cho cell lines. controls of
yohimbine and medetomidine and basal responses (solvent
control) were included for comparisons. the effects of yohimbine and two bivalent analogs (n ⫽ 3 and n ⫽ 24) are provided graphically in fig. 4. as noted in the graphs,  xxxd1742xxx 
produced an increase in camp levels, as assessed by luciferase changes using a 6 cre-luc reporter gene bioassay.
concentrations of yohimbine and bivalent analogs (n ⫽ 3 and
n ⫽ 24) were varied from 0.01 to 10 ␮m. the conditions of
incubation were as follows: the addition of yohimbine antagonist for 20 min; addition of medetomidine for 20 min; and

discussion
g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) known to exist as
dimers are emerging at an accelerated rate (bouvier, 2001).
gcprs are major pharmacological targets and therefore the
existence of dimers could have important implications for the
development and screening of new drugs. the bivalent
ligand approach has been successfully used in developing
highly potent and selective ligands in a diverse set of
receptor systems, such as the opioid (portoghese et al.,
1982; portoghese, 2001) and serotonergic (leboulluec et
al., 1995) receptors, two members of the seven transmembrane  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx  superfamily, as well as
the growth factor receptor system (e.g., the  xxxg2282xxx 
receptor) (cwirla et al., 1997). several studies have also
strengthened the possibility that ␣2a- and ␣2c-ars can
exist as dimers under normal physiological conditions
(maggio et al., 1993, 1996), which is supported by direct
observations of ␣2a-ar clustering using immunomicroscopic techniques (uhlen et al., 1995).
there is a high level of sequence and structure homology,
especially in the seven transmembrane regions of the ␣2-ar
subtypes; however, the extracellular loops are very diverse in
terms of the amino acid compositions among the three sub-

types. to date three ␣2-ar subtypes, ␣2a, ␣2b, and ␣2c, have
been classified using functional and molecular techniques.
however, available antagonist ligands such as idazoxan, rauwolscine, or  xxxd3000xxx  have at best only marginal-subtype
selectivity among the three ␣2-ar subtypes (macdonald et
al., 1997). therefore, in order to take advantage of receptor
dimerization and clustering and the extracellular loop diversity among the ␣2-ar subtypes, the bivalent ligand approach
was used in our efforts to identify ␣2c-ar subtype-selective
antagonists. for this purpose yohimbine was chosen as the
antagonist pharmacophore and was found to be a potent and
selective ␣2-ar antagonist. furthermore, our results show
that yohimbine is about 4- and 15-fold more selective for the
␣2c-ar compared with the ␣2a- and ␣2b-ar, respectively.
these findings agree with the previous work of bylund et al.
(1992) using these receptor subtypes from various sources.
also, the point of spacer attachment as an amide ester on the
c-16 carboxyl of yohimbine was selected such that the ligand
receptor binding interactions would not be impaired (zheng
et al., 2000). this site of modification was also chosen, based
on the report that the c-16 yohimbine-agarose conjugate is
an excellent affinity chromatography matrix for large-scale
micropurification of multiple ␣2-ar subtypes.

in the present study, a series of bivalent yohimbine analogs with atom linker lengths of n ⫽ 2 to n ⫽ 24 were
prepared and evaluated on the human ␣-ar subtypes. each
of the yohimbine dimers generally possessed a lower binding
affinity than that of yohimbine for the ␣2a- and the ␣2c-ar
subtypes. it is important to note that the dimeric yohimbine
analogs show much higher affinities for the ␣2a- and ␣2c-ar
subtypes versus the ␣2b-ar subtype at all linker lengths, and
there was also a high degree of selectivity of yohimbine
analogs for the ␣2c-ar subtype at spacers n ⫽ 2, 3, 4, 18, and
24. in particular, yohimbine dimers n ⫽ 3 and n ⫽ 24 bound
with an affinity for the ␣2c-ar subtype that was 32- and
355-fold and 82- and 776-fold greater than their binding to
the ␣2a- and ␣2b-ars, respectively. furthermore, the selectivity of binding affinities and functional antagonist potencies of these two yohimbine dimers for the ␣2c-ar subtype
were at least 1000-fold greater than those on the ␣1-ar
subtypes; and they were ⬎29-fold selective in reversing the
action of medetomidine on camp accumulations on the ␣2cversus the ␣2a-ar subtype, respectively. in these functional
studies, yohimbine was more potent than the two yohimbine
analogs, but was less selective (10-fold) as an antagonist of
the ␣2c-ar (table 3), and this correlates with the observed
differences in the binding affinity selectivity for yohimbine
versus these yohimbine analogs (table 1).
results of our studies using bivalent yohimbine pharmacophores have yielded highly selective and potent ␣2c-ar
antagonists. to our knowledge, the two bivalent analogs (n ⫽
3 and n ⫽ 24) represent the most selective antagonists identified so far for the human ␣2c-ar versus the other ␣2-ar
subtypes. there are other ␣2c-ar-selective ligands such as
mk-912 (uhlen et al., 1997). the yohimbine dimers n ⫽ 3
and n ⫽ 24 are 2.3- and 5.9-fold more selective for the ␣2cversus the ␣2a-ar and 118- and 259-fold more selective for
the ␣2c- versus the ␣2b-ar compared with mk-912 (table 1).
it is unclear as to the exact mechanism underlying the
␣2c-ar selectivity observed for these yohimbine dimers. it is
possible that one pharmacophore binds to the ligand receptor
site, with the second pharmacophore is binding with an adjacent site of the ligand binding pocket (shorter linkers, n ⫽
3), or with either one of the extracellular loops within the
same receptor, or a ligand binding pocket on a second receptor. the latter possibility has been found in studies of bivalent pharmacophores on other gpcr systems (portoghese,
2001). interactions with extracellular loops or with adjacent
receptors (molecular clustering of receptors) are most likely
to occur with the longer linkers (n ⫽ 18 and n ⫽ 24) used in
our study. however, we are unable to differentiate between
these three possibilities with these bivalent yohimbine analogs at the present time.
interestingly, varying the length of the spacer atoms linking the yohimbine molecules together had only modest effects
on ␣2c-ar affinities, whereas the binding potencies were
found to vary considerably in comparison with the ␣2a- and
␣2b-ar subtypes. these findings suggest that further
changes in atom spacer length, and possibly of the linker
composition, may lead to the development of more potent
␣2c-ar subtype-selective ligands.
taken collectively, these results indicate the following: 1)
