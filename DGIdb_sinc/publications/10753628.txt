recent evidence indicates that both leptin and eicosapentaenoic acids (epa) improve insulin sensitivity.
in the present study, we examined the effect of epa on
endogenous leptin expression in 3t3-l1 adipocytes to
clarify whether the epa’s effect is exerted through
leptin expression. epa caused a time- and dosedependent increase of leptin mrna levels in 3t3-l1
adipocytes. leptin mrna expression was significantly
increased up to 309.4 ⴞ 17.0% of the control by 24 h
(p < 0.01; n ⴝ 6). leptin secretion was also significantly increased up to 193.3 ⴞ 12.1% of the control by
24 h (p < 0.01; n ⴝ 6). epa is a ligand for peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) with the
highest affinity to ppar␣. we examined the effect on
leptin expression of  xxxd1724xxx , a ligand for ppar␣,
 xxxd331xxx , for ppar␤, or troglitazone, for ppar␥, to
clarify whether these ligands for ppars could mimic
epa-induced stimulation of leptin expression. neither
 xxxd1724xxx  nor  xxxd331xxx  affected leptin mrna expression, whereas troglitazone significantly suppressed leptin mrna expression. on the other hand,
inhibition by 6-diazo-5-oxo- xxxd2755xxx  of the ratelimiting enzyme in hexosamine biosynthesis blunted
epa-induced stimulation of leptin mrna expression
and its secretion. these data suggest that epa upregulates leptin gene expression and its secretion
probably through a hexosamine biosynthetic pathway.

leptin, the product of ob gene, is a hormone which is
primarily secreted from adipose tissue, and reduces
food intake and increases energy expenditure (1–5).
despite establishment of a crucial role of leptin in
adipostat (6 – 8), it remains not fully understood how
incoming energy is sensed and transduced into the
mechanism of the ob gene regulation. recent studies

revealed that the expression of ob gene is regulated by
several substances like insulin, glucocorticoids, tumornecrosis factor-␣ and so on (9 –29). the hexosamine
biosynthetic pathway is proposed as the mechanism
through which cells may sense the influx of nutrients.
high intracellular glucosamine concentrations increase leptin production in adipose tissue and skeletal
muscle (30), suggesting an important biochemical link
between nutritional state and leptin expression. furthermore, in rodents, leptin can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal independently, apart from
its suppressive effect on food intake (3, 31–35).
adipose tissue is the primary site of energy storage,
accumulates triglyceride at nutritional excess, and at
fasting releases both free  xxxd2154xxx  (ffa) and glycerol, generated from triglyceride. chain length and
unsaturation of  xxxd2154xxx  have been reported to affect
the expression of various genes in adipose cell lines (36,
37). indeed, ffa regulated and interacted with leptin
gene expression (30, 38, 39). leptin gene expression
was reported to be probably up-regulated in rats fed
with n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (39).
it has been shown that administration of crude fish
oil ameliorates insulin resistance induced by a high-fat
diet in rats (40). dietary supplementation with n-3
polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  improves insulin sensitivity in patients with niddm (41). dietary fat composition influences insulin resistance in rats (42). fish oil
lowers triglyceride level, so its intake may be useful in
treating dyslipidemia in diabetes (43). furthermore,
administration of eicosapentaenoic acids (epa), one of
dietary n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  present in fish
oil, resulted in improvement of hypertriglyceridemia
and insulin resistance in spontaneous niddm model
rats (44), although its mechanism remains unknown
so far.
we hypothesized that epa may modulate insulin
sensitivity via the changes in leptin expression. in this

study, we examined the effect of epa on leptin mrna
expression and leptin secretion in 3t3-l1 adipocytes
cultured in vitro. here we provide the first evidence for
stimulation by epa of leptin mrna expression and
leptin secretion in 3t3-l1 adipocytes.
materials and methods
cell culture. 3t3-l1 preadipocytes were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium plus 1 g/liter glucose (dmem) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), penicillin (200 u/ml), and streptomycin (50 ␮g/ml). confluent cells were differentiated into
adipocytes by culture in dmem containing 10% fbs plus 170 nm
insulin, 100 nm dexamethasone, and 500 ␮m isobutylmethylxantine
for 2 days, followed by 2 days in dmem containing 10% fbs plus 170
nm insulin. cells were then cultured in dmem containing 10% fbs
with regular changes for the remainder of the experiment. cell
differentiation occurred over the course of 5 to 7 days. when cells
became fully differentiated (⬎90%), cells were maintained for 12 h in
dmem with 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa). then cells were
cultured for 24 h in dmem containing 0.1% bsa with varing concentrations of test substances and collected for rna analysis. conditioned medium were also collected for measurement of secreted
leptin. epa ethyl ester (epa-e) were provided from mochida pharmaceutical co. (tokyo, japan),  xxxd331xxx  from kissei pharmaceutical co. (matsumoto, japan), and troglitazone from sankyo pharmaceutical co. (tokyo, japan).  xxxd1724xxx  and 6-diazo-5-oxo-lnorleucine were purchased from sigma.
reverse transcription and amplification of complementary dna.
total rna was prepared from cultured adipocytes using trizol according to the supplier (life technologies, inc.). the first strand
cdna was synthesized from 4 ␮g total rna using random hexamers
(geneamp rna pcr core kit, perkin–elmer, foster city, ca). pcr
was carried out in a 50-␮l reaction mixture containing 4 ␮l of the
above first-strand cdna, 5 ␮l of 10⫻ pcr buffer (mg 2⫹, boehringer),
1 ␮l of 10 mm dntp mix, 4 pmol of each primer and 2.5 u taq dna
polymerase (gibco). the mouse leptin sequence of the upstream
primer was 5⬘-ttttccatggtgcccatccaaaaatccaag-3⬘, and
of the downstream primer was 5⬘-tttctcgaggcacccagggctgaggtcca-3⬘ (1). the mouse ␤-actin sequence of the upstream
primer was 5⬘-tgacccagatcatgtttgaga gacc-3⬘, and of the
downstream primer was 5⬘-ccatacccaagaaggaaggc-3⬘ (26).
after an initial denaturation for 30 sec at 94°c, pcr was performed
for 30 cycles in the case of leptin and for 25 cycles in the case of
␤-actin, since levels of pcr products increased in a log-linear fashion
for up to 35 and 30 cycles for leptin and ␤-actin, respectively. the
conditions for pcr were 94°c for 1 min, 60°c for 1 min, 72°c for 1
min using pc 800 (astec). the mouse leptin-coding region was
obtained by rt-pcr and verified with dna sequencing (model 310,
perkin–elmer, applied biosystem).
analysis of the pcr products. the pcr products specific for
leptin and ␤-actin were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose
gel. dna was visualized by ethidium bromide staining at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. the intensities of the bands were evaluated
using a uv-light box imaging system (atto corporation).
leptin measurement. leptin concentrations in the cell culture
media were determined using a sandwich elisa (morinaga
mouse leptin elisa kit). minimal detectable quantity of this
assay is 200 pg/ml. both intra- and interassay variations were less
than 10%.
statistical analysis. the data were expressed as the mean ⫾ se,
unless noted otherwise. statistics were analyzed by one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) with a significant
level of 0.05.

results
time- and dose-dependent effect of epa-e on leptin
mrna expression
using rt-pcr method, 24-h treatment with 100 ␮m
epa-e caused a significant increase in leptin mrna
levels in adipocytes compared with those without
epa-e treatment (342.1 ⫾ 23.8 vs 101 ⫾ 1.7% basal
level, p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 1a). when we cultured 3t3-l1
adipocytes for 24 h with varying concentrations of
epa-e, 10-100 ␮m epa-e caused a significant and
dose-dependent increase in the expression of leptin
mrna in 3t3-l1 adipocytes as shown in fig. 1b. maximal effect appeared at 100 ␮m epa-e. 1000 ␮m
epa-e was significantly increased than the control
level, but less effective than 100 ␮m epa-e.
effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
(ppars) ligands on leptin mrna expression
epa is a natural ppars ligand, and activates all
three ppars (ppar-␣, ppar-␤ and ppar-␥) with the
highest affinity to ppar-␣. we tested the effect of
other specific ppar ligands on leptin mrna expression. the effective dose of  xxxd1724xxx ,  xxxd331xxx , or
troglitazone was chosen based on recent studies (45–
47). neither ppar-␣-specific ligand,  xxxd1724xxx  nor
ppar-␤-specific ligand,  xxxd331xxx  affected leptin
mrna expression. on the other hand, ppar-␥-specific
ligand, troglitazone significantly reduced leptin mrna
expression (fig. 2). however, ppar-␤-specific ligands
are not identified so far except xenopus ppar-␤specific ligand,  xxxd331xxx , and its activity is weaker
on the mammalian ppar-␤. moreover, neither the
function nor the array of genes regulated by this orphan receptor, are presently known. therefore, the
effect of ppar-␤ on leptin mrna expression remained
not fully elucidated in our study.
effect of 6-diazo-5-oxo- xxxd2755xxx  (don) on leptin
mrna expression and its secretion in the media
leptin mrna expression with 100 ␮m epa-e treatment was significantly increased up to 309.417.0% of
the control by 24 h in 3t3-l1 adipocytes (0.21 ⫾ 0.01 vs
0.66 ⫾ 0.04 relative units, p ⬍ 0.01; n ⫽ 6). leptin
secretion was also significantly increased up to 193.3 ⫾
12.1% of the control by 24 h (1.44 ⫾ 0.07 vs 2.80 ⫾ 0.29
ng/ml, p ⬍ 0.01; n ⫽ 6) (fig. 3). it has been reported
that high intracellular glucosamine concentrations increase leptin production in adipose tissue (30). increased inflow of ffa to adipocytes produces an increased amounts of fatty-acyl-coa, causing to the
inhibition of glycolysis, and subsequently increases
fluctose-6-phosphate, which increased substrate for
glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (gfat),

tablished inhibitor of gfat (48), and significantly attenuated epa-induced leptin mrna expression and
secretion (fig. 3).
discussion
we demonstrated for the first time that epa caused
a time- and dose-dependent increase in leptin mrna
expression and its secretion in cultured 3t3-l1 adipocytes using rt-pcr and elisa. the effective dose of
epa was comparable with its plasma concentrations
after ingestion of dietary epa.
we examined to clarify the mechanism by which
epa stimulated the expression of leptin mrna and its
secretion. epa is a natural ligand for ppars and binds
all three ppars with the highest affinity to ppar␣. to
elucidate whether epa regulated leptin through
ppars, we examined leptin mrna expression by  xxxd1724xxx ,  xxxd331xxx , or troglitazone which was a specific ligand for ppar␣, ␤, or ␥, respectively (45, 46, 49),
although  xxxd331xxx  is a less specific ligand for the
mammalian ppar␤. neither  xxxd1724xxx  nor  xxxd331xxx 
affected leptin mrna expression, whereas troglitazone
significantly repressed leptin mrna expression. these
findings are consistent with the results of a recent
study (47), and suggest that leptin induction by epa is
not mediated through any ppars.
the effect of epa on leptin mrna expression was
dose-dependent in a range of 0.1–100 ␮m epa. how-

ever, 1000 ␮m epa was less effective than 100 ␮m
epa. the mechanism of decreased leptin expression by
higher epa dose remains unknown, but may attribute
to dominant activation of suppressive mediator ppar␥
by the pharmacological dose of epa.
a recent report suggest that hexosamine biosynthetic pathway contributes to regulate leptin expression and that ffa increase the hexosamines to stimulate leptin mrna expression and leptin release in
rodents (30). in the present study, inhibition by don of
gfat completely abolished epa-stimulated leptin
mrna expression and its secretion. don is a well
established glutamine antagonist that irreversibly inhibits enzymatic reactions of gfat (48). these findings suggest that epa, one of ffa, up-regulates leptin
mrna expression and its secretion through hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, in good agreement with
the mechanism of ffa action reported by wang
et al. (30).

the mechanism by which epa improves insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia is not completely known so
far. stimulation by epa of leptin gene expression
found in our studies is also consistent with the recent
report that epa improves insulin sensitivity, since
leptin is reported to improve insulin sensitivity. however, ffa has been reported to induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle in rodents as well as humans.
these reports may not be discrepant with our findings,
since ffa, including  xxxd2154xxx  with different chain
length and unsaturated form, not only stimulates leptin gene expression but also inhibits glucose transport
(50) or increases the flux of fructose-6-phosphate into
the hexosamine pathway (51), leading to the resultant
insulin resistance. furthermore, ppars are nuclear
receptors for  xxxd2154xxx  that regulate glucose and lipid
homeostasis. whereas the hypolipidemic actions of the
fibrates appear to be primarily mediated through
ppar-␣, the glucose-lowering effects of the thiazolidinediones (tzd) are mediated through ppar-␥ (52).
epa binds efficiently all three ppars and activates
these receptors in cell-based assays (45, 46). epa has
lipid-lowering effects and enhances insulin sensitivity
in human and rodents, which is possibly mediated
through ppar-␣ and ppar-␥, since these effects are
similar to those of fibrates and tzds. we speculate
that epa can improve insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia mediated through leptin as well as ppars in
accordance with dietary epa intake.
hun et al. very recently reported the decrease in
leptin in mice fed with epa in vivo (53). in their study,

fig. 4. the hexosamine pathway receives 1–3% of the incoming
glucose through the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to glucosamine-6-phosphate by the rate-limiting enzyme gfat. increased
ffa generates increased fatty-acyl-coa, leading to the inhibition of
glycolysis, and increased fluctose-6-phosphate, which increased substrate for gfat.

the decrease of fat mass by epa appears to be responsible for the reduction in plasma leptin levels.
in conclusion, epa up-regulates leptin mrna expression and its secretion through hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in 3t3-l1 adipocytes. these findings
render the idea that beneficial effects of epa on ameliorating insulin resistance and dyslipidemia are mediated, at least in part, by leptin. further study is
required to clarify whether epa directly regulates insulin signaling such as phosphorylation of irs or expression or translocation of glucose transporter in target tissues.
