matrix and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans
(hspg)1 are complex and versatile molecules that display various functions in the cellular environment. hspgs can interact
with many different ligands and thereby participate to cell
adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation (1). among hspgs
expressed on the surface of most types of cells, syndecans form
a family that includes four members, three of them ( xxxg2036xxx -1, -2, and -4) being cloned in human cells (2–5). syndecans
are expressed in cell-, tissue-, and development-specific pat-

terns. in mineralized tissues, as in other mesenchymal tissues,
 xxxg2036xxx -1 is only expressed transiently at particular stages of
morphogenesis and cell differentiation (6). for example  xxxg2036xxx -1 is expressed during mesenchymal condensation in the
developing tooth (7). in adult tissues,  xxxg2036xxx -1 is mainly
expressed in epithelial cells (8). in contrast, the major source of
 xxxg2036xxx -2 appears to be mesenchymal cells. notably,  xxxg2036xxx -2 occurs during mouse bone development and osteoblast
differentiation and persists in differentiated hard tissues (9).
 xxxg2036xxx -3 was first identified in neural tissues but also seems
to play a role in limb development (10).  xxxg2036xxx -4 displays a
more ubiquitous distribution in different tissues (11).these
transmembrane pgs appear to display two main functions.
one is to bind extracellular ligands such as matrix adhesive
proteins, cell-cell adhesion molecules, enzymes, and growth
factors (11–13). all known ligand binding sites are localized on
glycosaminoglycan (gag) chains that syndecans bear on the
extracellular domain of their core protein. these gags are
mostly of the heparan sulfate type, although  xxxd1687xxx  chains could also be associated with  xxxg2036xxx -1 and -4
(11). the second function of syndecans may be to promote
signaling events that are associated with the ligand-dependent
activation of high affinity receptors. for example, syndecans
were found to stimulate fibroblast growth factor receptor
(fgfr)-1 occupancy and signaling by fgf (14). this may result from an increased availability of the ligand retained at the
cell surface or from a more efficient presentation to the receptor
(15, 16). moreover, syndecans display a highly conserved intracytoplasmic domain that includes several phosphorylatable
residues. this may indicate an important function of the cytoplasmic domain that may be kinase substrates. indeed,  xxxg2036xxx -4 can be phosphorylated on a serine residue, this phosphorylation being regulated by the protein kinase c and a fgfdependent serine/threonine phosphatase (17). on the other
hand, the cytoplasmic tail of syndecans was shown to be associated with molecules involved in intracellular signal transduction. thus, the cytosolic part of  xxxg2036xxx -3 can bind a protein
complex including src family kinases and their substrates (18).
the cooh-terminal fya sequence of syndecans was reported
to interact with syntenin, a pdz protein (19). another pdz
domain-containing protein, the cask/lin-2, was found to bind
the cooh-terminal motif of  xxxg2036xxx -2 (20, 21). these proteins may connect syndecans to the cytoskeleton and different
signaling pathways and allow them to participate to signaling
events induced by pg ligands.
granulocyte-macrophage  xxxg526xxx  ( xxxg526xxx ) is an heparin binding factor (22, 23) implicated in the
control of hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation
(24, 25). the biological activities of gm-csf are mediated by a
transmembrane high affinity receptor that is a heterodimeric
complex composed of an ␣ chain, which binds gm-csf specifically with low affinity, and a ␤ chain, which does not bind the

we previously showed that granulocyte-macrophage
 xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf) binds to heparan
sulfate proteoglycans expressed at the surface of osteoblastic cells and that the mitogenic activity of this cytokine is dependent on the presence of fully sulfated proteoglycans. in this study, we determined if gm-csf
interacts with syndecans, a family of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. human primary osteoblasts
were found to express  xxxg2036xxx -2 and -4 but few  xxxg2036xxx -1 transcripts and proteins. recombinant human
gm-csf coupled to biotin was found to bind to  xxxg2036xxx -2. immunocytochemical transmission electron microscope analysis showed co-localization of  xxxg2036xxx -2
and gm-csf at the cell membrane surface.  xxxg2036xxx -2
also co-localized at the cell surface and co-immunoprecipitated with the gm-csf receptor ␣ chain, suggesting
a strong interaction between the cytokine, its receptor,
and  xxxg2036xxx -2. phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in
 xxxg2036xxx -2 associated with the ␣ chain of the gm-csf
receptor was increased after cell stimulation by  xxxg526xxx . antisense oligonucleotides that reduced specifically the expression of  xxxg2036xxx -2 inhibited the mitogenic activity of gm-csf and the activation of
extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 induced by the
cytokine. our results indicate functional interactions
between  xxxg2036xxx -2 and gm-csf in osteoblasts, and we
propose that  xxxg2036xxx -2 plays a role as a co-receptor for
this cytokine.

experimental procedures

materials—unglycosylated recombinant human (rh) gm-csf was
kindly provided by novartis. heparin, heparinase iii, chondroitinase
abc, protein a-sepharose, diaminobenzamidine and biotinylaminocaproic acid n-hydroxysuccinimide (n-biotin) were purchased from
sigma. hitrap q cartridges were purchased from amersham pharmacia
biotech. monoclonal anti- xxxg2036xxx -1 (mca681) was from serotec.
monoclonal anti- xxxg2036xxx -2 (mab 10h4) and anti- xxxg2036xxx -4 (mab
8g3) were generously provided by dr. guido david (leuven, belgium).
anti- xxxd1075xxx  (mab 4g10) was purchased from upstate biotechnology, inc. purified polyclonal rabbit anti-human gm-csf (antigm-csf), polyclonal and monoclonal anti-gm-csf receptor ␣ antibodies (anti-gmr␣ and  xxxg527xxx ), and monoclonal anti-gm-csf receptor ␤
(anti-gmr␤) were from genzyme. polyclonal rabbit anti-active form of
the mapk was from promega.
human cell cultures—primary cultures of normal human osteoblastic (hob) cells and cloned immortalized hob cells (ahto-7) were
obtained as described previously (33, 34) and cultured in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(fcs).
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification—rna extracted
from hob cells were used as template for reverse transcriptase reaction. the cdna obtained was amplified using amplification primers
that were synthesized based on published sequences of human  xxxg2036xxx -1 (2), human  xxxg2036xxx -2 (3), and human  xxxg2036xxx -4 (5) (table i).

aliquots of the amplified cdna were size-fractionated in 2% agarose
gel, and the pcr products were then identified by southern hybridization using specific internal oligonucleotide probes (table i) that were 5⬘
end-labeled.
immunocytochemistry—the hob cells were grown in multiwell
chambers and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. nonspecific binding sites
were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) containing 3% bovine  xxxg124xxx  and goat or sheep serum diluted 1:3. the following
antibodies were used as primary antibodies: affinity-purified mouse
monoclonal anti-human plasmacytes that recognize  xxxg2036xxx -1
(mca681), mouse monoclonal antibodies 10h4 and 8g3 recognizing
 xxxg2036xxx -2 and -4, respectively (5, 9), mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing the human common ␤ chain receptor for  xxxg1177xxx ,  xxxg1180xxx , and gm-csf, and mouse monoclonal antibody anti-human
gm-csf ␣ chain receptor. the secondary antibodies were anti-mouse
igg linked to colloidal gold particles (amersham pharmacia biotech),
which were enlarged by precipitation of metallic silver before microscopic visualization using an inverse condenser (olympus bh-2). for
transmission electron microscopy analysis, cells were incubated with 10
ng/ml  xxxd3093xxx  for 5 min at 37 °c, then washed in pbs and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde. a double immunostaining using mouse antisyndecan-2 and polyclonal rabbit anti-gm-csf or anti-gmr␣ was then
performed. labeling was revealed using anti-mouse and anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies linked to 10-nm and 5-nm beads, respectively.
after the immunological reaction, cells were post-fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated in graded ethanol series, and embedded in
epoxy resin. ultrathin sections (60 –70 nm) were performed, treated
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed in transmission
electron microscopy (jeol 100 cxii) at high magnification. isolated and
coupled gold particles (total ⬎1,000 particles) localized at the outer
surface of the cells were counted.
preparation of proteoglycans—a protein fraction enriched in proteoglycans was obtained as described (35). ahto-7 cells were lysed in 4 m
guanidine-hcl extraction solution (ph 6) containing 50 mm sodium
acetate, 10 mm edta, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 m
6- xxxd146xxx , 20 mm  xxxd302xxx -hcl, and 2% triton x-100.
extraction solution was then exchanged on sephadex g-25 for a chromatography buffer (20 mm tris (ph 7.2), 7 m urea, 10 mm edta, 5 mm
 xxxd2684xxx , 0.5 m phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2% triton
x-100). the protein extract was then deposited on a q-sepharose column (hitrap). after washing with chromatography buffer containing
0.1 m nacl, proteoglycans were eluted with the same buffer containing
1 m nacl. the proteoglycan fraction was desalted, and the protein
content was assayed by uv spectrophotometry.
binding assay of biotin- xxxd3093xxx  to pg—biotin was linked to
 xxxd3093xxx  using a previously described method (36). to do that, 10 ␮g
of  xxxd3093xxx  were reacted with 1 ␮g of ns-biotin in pbs at ph 8.3. the
reaction was performed in the presence of 100 ␮g of heparin to protect
potential heparin-binding sites on gm-csf. at the end of the reaction,
pbs containing 2 m nacl was added to dissociate heparin from proteins, and  xxxd3093xxx  linked to biotin (biotin- xxxd3093xxx ) was separated from free reagents on sephadex g-25. proteoglycans (0.2 mg/well)
obtained as described above were subjected to 4 –15% sds-page under
nonreducing conditions and were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (amersham pharmacia biotech). the membrane was cut in different strips; one part was used for binding assay,
and the other part for immunoblotting as described below, except that
diaminobenzamidine was used as peroxidase substrate. precise marks
on the membrane allowed its reconstitution at the end of the experiments. before the binding assay, strips of the membrane were digested
at 37 °c with 10 milliunits/ml heparinase iii or 33 milliunits /ml chondroitinase abc diluted in tris-hcl (ph 7.2) containing 1 mm cacl2, 0.5
mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , and a mixture of protease inhibitors (35).
digested and nondigested strips of the membrane were blocked for
nonspecific binding in 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5) and 150 mm nacl
(tris-buffered saline) containing 0.5% gelatin for 1 h at room temperature and then exposed to biotin- xxxd3093xxx  for 90 min at 37 °c. at the
end of this incubation, after rapid washes, strips were reacted with
avidin-peroxidase for 30 min. recombinant hgm-csf bound to proteoglycans on the membrane was revealed using diaminobenzamidine as
peroxidase substrate.
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting—confluent ahto-7 cells
were serum-starved for 24 h. the medium was then changed for dulbecco’s-modified eagle’s medium containing 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx ,
and after a 1-h incubation at 37 °c, the cells were treated with rhgmcsf for 0, 5, 10, or 30 min. the cells were then transferred onto ice,
washed with pbs, and lysed in 10 mm tris (ph 7.5) with 5 mm edta,
200 mm nacl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1

cytokine but is essential for its signal transduction (24). both ␣
and ␤ chains are members of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily and lack intrinsic  xxxg2198xxx  activity. signaling
by gm-csf depends on tyrosine kinases associated with the
receptor, such as jak2, which is associated with the ␤ chain of
the gm-csf receptor (26). stimulation of gm-csf-dependent
cell lines with the cytokine has been found to induce a variety
of immediate cellular responses including rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates, activation of components of
the ras signaling pathway such as mitogen-activated protein
kinase (mapk), and induction of early genes transcription (26,
27). in the skeleton, gm-csf is a potential regulator of bone
cells. this hematological factor was found to be produced by
different osteoblastic cell lines in response to stimuli (28, 29).
exogenous gm-csf stimulates human osteoblast-like cell
growth and antagonizes the induction by  xxxd408xxx  of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase activity (30). we
previously showed that gm-csf is an autocrine growth factor
for normal human osteoblastic cells (31). we subsequently
found that gm-csf not only binds to hspg expressed at the
osteoblastic cell surface but that the mitogenic activity of  xxxg526xxx  is dependent on the presence of fully sulfated pgs in these
cells (32). this suggested to us that gm-csf could be a ligand
for syndecans that may be involved in the control of the mitogenic activity of the cytokine. in this study we therefore determined if gm-csf is able to interact with syndecans in osteoblasts. our results provide evidence for functional interactions
between  xxxg2036xxx -2 and gm-csf, and we propose that  xxxg2036xxx -2 may play a role as a co-receptor for this cytokine in
osteoblastic cells.

results

osteoblasts express syndecans—the expression of syndecans in osteoblastic cells was examined by reverse transcriptase-pcr, immunocytochemistry, and immunoblotting in
two types of osteoblastic cells, primary cultures of cells derived
from the trabecular bone surface (hob cells) and clonal immortalized hob cells (ahto-7 cells). except for the proliferation
rate, these two cell types display similar characteristics of the
mature osteoblast phenotype (33, 34). as expected in mature
mesenchymal cells, hob (fig. 1a) and ahto-7 cells (not
shown) expressed low levels of  xxxg2036xxx -1. in contrast, reverse
transcriptase-pcr analysis revealed high levels of  xxxg2036xxx -2
and -4 mrna (fig. 1a). these results were confirmed by northern blot hybridization (not shown).  xxxg2036xxx -2 and -4 synthe-

showed that the amplified cdnas have the predicted sizes for the
syndecans. these products hybridized with the specific probes. hob
cells expressed high levels of mrna for  xxxg2036xxx -2 and -4 and lower
mrna levels for  xxxg2036xxx -1. b, hob cells were stained with purified
mouse anti-human  xxxg2036xxx -1 (a), anti- xxxg2036xxx -2 (b), or anti- xxxg2036xxx -4 (c). negative control cells were reacted with mouse ig to detect
nonspecific staining (d). staining was revealed using anti mouse-ig
link to gold particles that were enlarged by precipitation of metallic
silver. a low level of  xxxg2036xxx -1 was detected compared with  xxxg2036xxx -2 and -4. bp, base pair.

sis was found to correlate with the mrna levels as shown by
immunocytochemistry in hob cells (fig. 1b) and western blot
analysis in ahto-7 cells (fig. 2b). these results demonstrate
that human osteoblastic cells mainly express  xxxg2036xxx -2
and -4.
biotin- xxxd3093xxx  binds to heparan sulfate chains of  xxxg2036xxx -2—to determine the interactions between gm-csf and
syndecans in human osteoblastic cells, a pg-enriched fraction
was obtained from ahto-7 cells. separation of these proteins
was based on their high negative charge, which makes them
bind strongly to an anion exchange column. we initially
checked that the fraction eluted by buffer with 1 m nacl contained most of the proteins that were metabolically labeled
with 35s in ahto-7 culture. pgs isolated from osteoblastic
cells were separated on sds-page in nonreducing conditions
and electrotransferred on a membrane to analyze their capacity to bind biotin-conjugated  xxxd3093xxx . different species of
pgs (20, 45, and 70 kda) displayed affinity for biotin-rhgmcsf (fig. 2a, lane 1). binding of gm-csf was strongly decreased when pgs on the membrane were digested by heparinase iii before incubation with the cytokine (fig. 2a, lane 2),
whereas chondroitinase abc digestion did not modify pg affinity (fig. 2a, lane 3), indicating that gm-csf-pg interaction
mostly depends on heparan sulfate side chains. to identify
some of the pgs that bind gm-csf, part of the membrane with
blotted pg was incubated with anti- xxxg2036xxx  antibodies instead of the cytokine (fig. 2b, lane 4 and 5). this revealed
heparan sulfate chains of  xxxg2036xxx -2 bind  xxxd3093xxx .
co-localization of  xxxg2036xxx -2 and gm-csf at the cell surface—to determine if the interaction between  xxxg2036xxx -2 and
gm-csf occurred at the surface of hob cells, a double immunostaining of these proteins was performed using a rabbit
polyclonal anti-gm-csf and a mouse monoclonal anti-synde-

mm activated sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% triton
x-100. the cell lysates were clarified by incubation with 10 ␮l of protein
a-sepharose for 1 h and centrifugation at 12,000 ⫻ g for 10 min. protein
content was then quantified. one mg of each protein extract was incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-gmr␣ or anti- xxxg2036xxx -2 (10h4)
and 10 ␮l of protein a-sepharose. immune complexes were washed 3
times with lysis buffer, boiled 10 min in tris containing 2.3% sds, 10%
glycerol, and 5%  xxxd26xxx , then resolved on sds-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. immunoblotting was performed by incubating the membrane
with primary antibodies at 4 °c overnight and then with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin (amersham pharmacia
biotech) as the secondary antibody. signals were detected using a
chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (amersham pharmacia
biotech).
antisense oligonucleotide experiments—the antisense oligomer
(as) used was complementary to the first 25 bases of the translation
start site of rat  xxxg2036xxx -2 mrna (37) and had the following sequence:
ccggggacgtggctcgtaccc. a random (r) oligonucleotide composed of the 25 randomly arranged bases of the as was used as control
and had the following sequence: agtgcggcgccgcgtctagcc. the
r sequence was checked on a computed data base not to be complementary to any known sequence. the oligonucleotides were protected from
endonucleases by phosphorothioate modification at the 3⬘ end. before
oligonucleotide treatment, hob cells were plated at 5,000 cells/cm2 in
multiwell chambers and cultured for 2 days in the presence of 10% fcs
to allow homogenous cell adhesion and with 30 mm sodium chlorate to
reduce the presence of sulfated glycosaminoglycans at the cell surface
(32). the medium was then changed for serum-free dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium containing 2 ␮m as or r oligonucleotides or the diluent.
after 2 days of culture in the presence of oligonucleotides, the medium
was replaced, and the culture was continued for 3 days in the presence
or absence of 10 ng/ml  xxxd3093xxx  or 1% fcs and in the presence or
absence of 10 ng/ml heparin. at the end of the culture, the cells were
washed, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, stained with hematoxylin, and
the number of cells/cm2 was counted using an ocular integrator
mounted on a microscope (olympus, bh2). to ensure that as affected
only  xxxg2036xxx -2, the effect of as and r oligonucleotides on the expression of syndecans was determined by immunocytochemistry in the same
culture conditions as the cell proliferation assay. cell cultures were
cultured for 2 days in the presence of as or r oligonucleotides and
stopped before  xxxd3093xxx  treatment, and immunocytochemistry of
 xxxg2036xxx -1, -2, and -4 was performed as described above. the effect of
 xxxg2036xxx -2 inhibition on the expression of gm-csf receptor was also
examined by immunochemistry in the same conditions. to assess that
as effectively reduced  xxxg2036xxx -2 levels, we used a quantitative
method previously shown to be accurate in determining precise changes
in protein levels under as treatment (31, 38). the number of cells
expressing  xxxg2036xxx -2, gmr␣, and gmr␤ in the presence of as or r
oligonucleotides was counted in 3– 4 wells, and the results were reported as % of total number of cells.
the effect of  xxxg2036xxx -2 suppression on gm-csf signaling was determined by examining the activation of mapk induced by  xxxd3093xxx 
in the presence of oligonucleotides. ahto-7 cells were treated for 2
days with 2 ␮m as or r oligonucleotides in medium containing 1% fcs
then stimulated for 10 min with 10 ng/ml  xxxd3093xxx  and lysed onto ice.
one-hundred ␮g of total protein extract were separated on sds-page,
and activation of mapk was determined by western blot as described
above using an affinity-purified rabbit igg that recognizes the phosphorylated active form of the mapk enzymes,  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx .

synthesis of  xxxg2036xxx -2 in hob cells. we first examined by
immunocytochemistry the level of  xxxg2036xxx -2 expression after

found by transmission electron microscopy using secondary
antibodies linked to 10-nm and 5-nm beads, respectively (fig.
3a). in these conditions, the cells were post-fixed only after the
immunocytochemical reaction was performed, explaining the
low contrast of the cell membrane (fig. 3). beads present at the
cell surface were counted and were considered as associated
when the distance in between was less than 15 nm. about 30%
of the beads that labeled  xxxg2036xxx -2 and 25% of the beads that
labeled gm-csf were found associated with beads of the other
size. these results show that  xxxg2036xxx -2 and gm-csf colocalize at the cell surface and further indicate that  xxxg2036xxx -2
is one of the pgs of the cell surface that interacts with gm-csf
in osteoblasts.
interaction between  xxxg2036xxx -2 and gmr␣—all functions of
gm-csf were shown to depend on its binding to a transmembranous receptor (gmr) (24). we thus used the method of
double-staining analyzed by electron microscopy to examine
the localization of  xxxg2036xxx -2 and gmr␣ at the surface of hob
cells. about 30% of the beads that labeled  xxxg2036xxx -2 or gmr␣
were found to be associated, showing that molecules of  xxxg2036xxx -2 were co-localized with gmr␣ (fig. 3b). to confirm that
gmr␣ and  xxxg2036xxx -2 associate at the cell surface, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay in ahto-7 cells stimulated or not with  xxxd3093xxx . gmr␣ was immunoprecipitated
with a polyclonal antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were
resolved by sds-page and blotted onto a membrane that was
probed with anti- xxxg2036xxx -2. as shown in fig. 4,  xxxg2036xxx -2
co-immunoprecipitated with gmr␣. the amount of  xxxg2036xxx -2
associated with gmr␣ did not seem to depend on stimulation
by exogenous  xxxd3093xxx , at least after 5 and 10 min of treatment with the cytokine (fig. 4). these results demonstrate that
 xxxg2036xxx -2 is associated with gmr␣ at the surface of the
osteoblasts and strengthen the hypothesis of functional interactions between  xxxg2036xxx -2 and gm-csf.
protein phosphorylation is one of the major events that allows propagation of intracellular signals. to address the question of the possible implication of  xxxg2036xxx -2 in the intracellular signaling events induced by gm-csf, we examined tyrosine
residue phosphorylation of  xxxg2036xxx -2 associated with gmr␣
after ligation of  xxxd3093xxx . we tested the effect of  xxxd3093xxx 
stimulation on tyrosine phosphorylation in  xxxg2036xxx -2 co-immunoprecipitated with gmr␣. to do that, the membrane with
blotted immunoprecipitates was probed again with an antiphosphotyrosine. the addition of  xxxd3093xxx  for 5–30 min induced increased phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in  xxxg2036xxx -2 (fig. 4). together, these results indicate that  xxxg2036xxx -2
is involved not only in the binding of the cytokine to its high

2 days of culture in the presence of the as or r oligonucleotides
and prior to treatment with  xxxd3093xxx .  xxxg2036xxx -2 levels
were reduced in the presence of as but not r oligonucleotides
(fig. 5a). the quantitative determination of  xxxg2036xxx -2-positive cells showed that as significantly decreased the expression of  xxxg2036xxx -2 in osteoblasts, whereas r oligonucleotides
had no effect (fig. 5b). as oligonucleotides did not affect the
expression of gmr␣ and gmr␤ (fig. 5, a and b). we also
checked that the as used did not affect the expression of
 xxxg2036xxx -1 and -4 in these cells (not shown). having shown
that as oligonucleotides selectively reduced the level of  xxxg2036xxx -2 in osteoblastic cells, we examined the biological consequences of the reduced  xxxg2036xxx -2 expression in a proliferation
assay in the presence or absence of  xxxd3093xxx . the cells were
cultured in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of
as or r oligonucleotides alone for 2 days, and then  xxxd3093xxx 
and/or heparin or fcs were added for 3 days. consistent with
our previous findings (31, 32), hob cells proliferated in the
absence of exogenous mitogenic factors, and the basal proliferation rate was enhanced in the presence of  xxxd3093xxx . the
rate of proliferation was similar in r-treated cells and in cells
cultured in the absence of oligonucleotides. moreover, rhgmcsf similarly enhanced the number of control and r-treated
cells (fig. 6). in contrast, as-treated hob cells with reduced
 xxxg2036xxx -2 expression displayed a lower basal proliferation
rate than control cells. furthermore, the mitogenic activity of

 xxxd3093xxx  was abolished in as-treated cells (fig. 6). this
effect was not due to a toxic effect of oligonucleotides since
as-treated cells were still able to respond to 1% fcs to the
same level as control cells (fig. 6). moreover, we checked that
the number of as-treated cells was higher after 3 days of
culture compared with the number of cells present when  xxxg526xxx  treatment was initiated (not shown), indicating that the
lower number of as-treated cells at the end of the culture
resulted from a reduced proliferation rate and not from cell
death. these results indicate that  xxxg2036xxx -2 is involved in the
mitogenic activity of gm-csf in osteoblastic cells.
we previously showed that low doses of heparin are able to
recover the gm-csf-induced proliferation in cells that express
pgs with under-sulfated gags (32). in the present study, we
found that the addition of heparin did not rescue the inhibition
of gm-csf mitogenic activity induced by  xxxg2036xxx -2 as (table
ii). the inability of heparin to rescue the inhibitory effect of as
on cell growth further suggests that, in addition to its heparan
sulfate compounds, the core protein of  xxxg2036xxx -2 participates
to the control of gm-csf-induced cell growth.
effect of  xxxg2036xxx -2 suppression on gm-csf signaling—
binding of gm-csf to its high affinity receptor leads to the
activation of the mapk signaling pathway (27) and rapid phosphorylation of  xxxd1355xxx  and p42 mapk (also referred as extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 ( xxxg1369xxx ) and  xxxg1366xxx , respectively).
to determine the effect of  xxxg2036xxx -2 suppression on gm-csf
signaling, we examined the effect of as oligonucleotides on
activation of  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  by  xxxd3093xxx . ahto-7 cells
were treated with as or r oligonucleotides and stimulated with
 xxxd3093xxx . total protein extract was then separated on sdspage, and the level of activated  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  was determined by western blot. we found that  xxxd3093xxx  enhanced
the level of activated  xxxg1369xxx  and that suppression of  xxxg2036xxx -2
inhibited  xxxg1369xxx  activation by  xxxd3093xxx  (fig. 7). these results
together with our data on  xxxg2036xxx -2 phosphorylation and
heparin effect strongly suggest a role for  xxxg2036xxx -2 in intracellular signaling induced by gm-csf binding.

discussion

we recently showed that the mitogenic activity of gm-csf in
osteoblasts depends on interactions with cellular sulfated
heparan sulfate chains (32). the results presented in this paper
provide the first evidence for functional interactions between
gm-csf and  xxxg2036xxx -2 and identify this transmembrane
hspg as a potential co-receptor for this cytokine.
we first examined the binding capacity of pgs isolated from
osteoblastic cells and showed that different hspgs display
affinity for gm-csf. heparinase treatment reduced homogenously the binding of the cytokine to pgs, showing that binding of gm-csf to the cellular osteoblastic pgs depends on
heparan sulfate gags. identification of pgs that bear gags
responsible for the interactions with gm-csf is an important
step to understanding how these interactions are involved in
the regulation of gm-csf activity. syndecans appeared to be
good candidates for the interactions with gm-csf. indeed, this
protein family is the major form of membrane-associated hspg
expressed by many cells (12, 13) and is able to bind growth
factors including fgf (39) and heparin binding growth-associated molecule (40). we therefore examined the expression of
syndecans in human osteoblasts. our findings demonstrate
that osteoblastic cells derived from adult human bone express
low levels of  xxxg2036xxx -1 and high levels of  xxxg2036xxx -2 and -4.
the low pattern of  xxxg2036xxx -1 expression is consistent with
reports showing that  xxxg2036xxx -1 is expressed in mesenchymal
tissues only at particular stages of the development and is
almost restricted to epithelial cells in adult tissues (6, 7). in
contrast,  xxxg2036xxx -2 was found to be expressed exclusively by
mesenchymal cells in different tissues, whereas  xxxg2036xxx -4 is
known as the most ubiquitous distribution in different tissues
(9, 11). the distinct expression of  xxxg2036xxx -1, -2, and -4 in
normal human osteoblastic cells is in accordance with their
expression in osteogenic cells during mouse development and
rat neonatal ossification (9, 41).
immunoblotting analysis performed in parallel with the
binding assay on pgs extracted from osteoblastic cells allowed
identification of  xxxg2036xxx -2 as a major hspg that binds  xxxg526xxx . to determine if this interaction between blotted synde-

treated for 2 days with r or as  xxxg2036xxx -2 oligonucleotides. the cells
were then incubated in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml  xxxd3093xxx 
for 5 min and lysed. 100 ␮g of total protein extract were western-blotted
with anti-activated mapk that recognizes both  xxxg1369xxx  and -2. rhgmcsf stimulation increased  xxxg1369xxx  in r-treated cells but not in as

can-2 and gm-csf also occurs at the cell surface, we performed
a double immunological staining of  xxxg2036xxx -2 and the cytokine in hob cells. our data showed that labeled molecules of
 xxxg2036xxx -2 and gm-csf were associated and co-localized on
the cell surface, which supports our results showing binding of
gm-csf to  xxxg2036xxx -2. we therefore examined this interaction to determine if it is functional and may play a role in the
mitogenic activity of the cytokine. we used an antisense strategy to reduce  xxxg2036xxx -2 expression. as oligonucleotides reduced specifically immunoreactive  xxxg2036xxx -2 levels, whereas
 xxxg2036xxx -1 and -4 levels were not modified. although not striking, the efficiency of as to reduce  xxxg2036xxx -2 expression was
comparable with that previously observed in human osteoblastic cell cultures (31). interestingly, the reduction in  xxxg2036xxx -2
levels induced by as oligonucleotides was associated with decreased basal cell proliferation. this may be related in part to
reduction of endogenous gm-csf activity, since we previously
found that this cytokine is an autocrine growth factor in human
osteoblasts (31). moreover, the mitogenic activity of  xxxd3093xxx 
was abolished by  xxxg2036xxx -2 as, and this effect was associated
with inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx  activation. the inhibition of gm-csf
mitogenic activity in as-treated cells was not due to a reduction of gm-csf receptor expression. these data indicate that
 xxxg2036xxx -2 plays a role in the control of gm-csf signaling and
activity in osteoblasts.
we previously showed that reduction of gags sulfation by
chlorate treatment, which results in lower binding capacity of
gags at the cell surface, also inhibits the mitogenic activity of
gm-csf (31). thus, a major role of  xxxg2036xxx -2 in gm-csf
sequestration at the cell surface may account for the involvement of this hspg in the cytokine activity. interaction with
gags has been shown to protect soluble factors from degradation (42). such interactions are also thought to increase the
concentration of the ligand at the proximity of high affinity
receptors (15, 16, 43). the number of gm-csf receptors expressed by responding cells is very low, typically 800 to 1000
sites/cell in hematopoietic cells and 120 sites/cell in endothelial
cells (24). binding of gm-csf to gags of  xxxg2036xxx -2 may
increase the probability for this ligand to interact with its high
affinity receptors. interaction with hspg may also promote
ligand-receptor binding. such a role was demonstrated for perlecan, a hspg present in the basement membrane that binds
 xxxg787xxx  and allows  xxxg787xxx -mediated mitogenic response by promoting the binding of this factor to its high affinity receptor
(44). syndecans were also found to increase  xxxg787xxx  binding to
its receptor when transfected in cells that express low levels of
cell-surface hspg (14). in the present study, the co-localization
of  xxxg2036xxx -2 and gmr␣ at the surface of osteoblastic cells
suggests that  xxxg2036xxx -2 may play a role in the presentation of
gm-csf to its receptor. in addition,  xxxg2036xxx -2 co-immunoprecipitated with gmr␣, indicating a strong association between  xxxg2036xxx -2 and the receptor. based on these results,
direct interactions between this hspg and gmr␣ can be postulated similar to those observed between heparin and other

cans in various cell types (6) is known to affect osteoblast
proliferation and differentiation through interaction with fgfrs (49). we recently found that  xxxg2036xxx -2 is co-expressed
with fgfrs in osteoblasts during rat calvaria osteogenesis
(41).  xxxg2036xxx -2 may therefore play an important regulatory
role, controlling the biological activity of local heparan sulfate
binding growth factors in osteoblasts.
in summary, our results provide evidence that  xxxg2036xxx -2
interacts with gm-csf and its receptor at the surface of human osteoblastic cells. both the heparan sulfate chains that are
responsible of gm-csf binding and the core protein that seems
involved in intracellular signaling events form a co-receptor for
the cytokine. thus, different domains in  xxxg2036xxx -2 are involved in the control of gm-csf mitogenic activity and signaling in human osteoblastic cells.

dependent growth factor receptors such as fgfr. indeed, a
ternary functional interaction between heparin, fgf, and
fgfr has been demonstrated (45). a heparin binding domain
was found in the fgf receptor, and suppression of this site by
mutation was shown to inhibit heparin and fgf binding to the
receptor and to result in inhibition of the  xxxg2198xxx  activity of this receptor (45). interestingly, the ␣ and ␤ chains of
the gm-csf receptor belong to the hematopoietin receptor
superfamily (46). these glycoproteins comprise structures related to fibronectin type iii domain, and heparin-binding sites
have been localized in these fibronectin domains (46, 47). thus,
functional interactions between these potential heparan-binding sites in gm-csf receptor and heparan sulfate chains in
 xxxg2036xxx -2 may participate to the control of gm-csf
signaling.
the interacting capacity of heparan sulfate chains of syndecans may not be alone responsible for all  xxxg2036xxx  functions. in
a previous study, we found that the inhibitory effect of chlorate
treatment on gm-csf mitogenic activity was reversed by low
concentrations of heparin (32). in contrast, the inhibitory effect
of as oligonucleotides on cell growth was not rescued by the
addition of heparin. this suggests that the core protein is also
required and may play a role in the control of gm-csf activity.
the cytoplasmic tail of syndecans contain four conserved tyrosine residues (11). recently, tyrosine residues of  xxxg2036xxx -1
and -4 were shown to be phosphorylated in adherent fibroblasts
(48). this phosphorylation seems to depend on the cell type and
to be tightly controlled by both kinases and phosphatases,
suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylations may be a key event
in  xxxg2036xxx  activity. we show here that phosphorylation of
tyrosine residues of  xxxg2036xxx -2 associated with gmr␣ in osteoblastic cells is increased in the presence of  xxxd3093xxx . this
indicates that  xxxg2036xxx -2 is involved in intracellular signaling
events that are activated by the cytokine. these results are
consistent with recent findings showing that the cytoplasmic
domain of syndecans are associated with signaling molecules.
for example,  xxxg2036xxx -3, a cell surface receptor for heparin
binding growth-associated molecule, binds tyrosine kinases of
the src family and substrates such as cortactin (18). moreover,
this signaling pathway appears to be activated during heparin
binding growth-associated molecule-dependent neurite outgrowth (18). highly conserved cytoplasmic domains of syndecans were also shown to interact with pdz domains of cask,
a membrane-associated  xxxg1005xxx  (20, 21). this type of
multidomain scaffold proteins interacting with the cytoskeleton is thought to organize specific signaling networks and to
connect extracellular signals to downstream signaling pathways. these observations together with the results presented
in this paper suggest that  xxxg2036xxx -2 core protein may participate in the modulation of gm-csf mitogenic activity by activation of proper signaling pathways run in parallel or connected to intracellular signaling events that depend on the
gm-csf high affinity receptor.
interactions between  xxxg2036xxx -2 and gm-csf may have
functional biological implications in osteoblast p. it may result
in fine tuning of osteoblastic cell growth and differentiation.
indeed gm-csf was shown to be an autocrine/paracrine regulator of osteoblastic cell growth in vitro (28 –31) and in vivo in
mouse calvaria osteoblastic cells.2 this cytokine was also found
to modulate alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin (30)
and reduces type i collagen expression.2 it can also be postulated that  xxxg2036xxx -2 may be involved in the control of other
heparan sulfate binding factors than gm-csf in osteoblasts.
for example,  xxxg787xxx  that binds to and is modulated by synde-
