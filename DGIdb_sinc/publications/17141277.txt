abstract
the effect of beta antagonists in the diabetic vascular lesion is controversial. we investigated the effect of  xxxd458xxx  hydrochloride, a  xxxg836xxx  antagonist
and mild  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  agonist, on the lesions and function in type ii male otsuka long-evans tokushima fatty (oletf) diabetic rats. oletf rats were fed
regular chow with or without atenolol (25 mg/kg/day) or  xxxd458xxx  (100 mg/kg/day) treatment (group dm, no treatment; group dm-a, atenolol
treatment; group dm-c,  xxxd458xxx  treatment), and treatment was continued for 31 days. separately, normoglycemic control rats, leto, were prepared
as group c. on day 3, endothelial cells of the right internal carotid artery were removed by balloon injury, and the rats were evaluated 4 weeks after
balloon injury. the plasma glucose and lipid levels were unchanged throughout the treatment period. intimal thickening was observed in the right
carotid artery in the dm and dm-a groups; however, little thickening was observed in those of dm-c rats. acetylcholine-induced no-dependent
relaxation in arteries was improved in dm-c rats compared with dm and dm-a rats (maximum relaxation dm 30.8 ± 4.5, dm-a 37.4 ± 3.9, dm-c
48.8 ± 4.6%, ⁎p b 0.05 vs. dm for dm-c rats). tone-related basal no release and acetylcholine-induced no-dependent relaxation in the arteries and
plasma nox (sum of no−2 and no−3 ) were greater in dm-c and c groups than in dm and dm-a groups. the serum  xxxg2296xxx  levels did not increase in
dm-c rats compared with those of the dm or dm-a groups, and were comparable with those of group c.
conclusion: in conclusion,  xxxd458xxx  improves endothelial function in the arteries of oletf rats, and further restore it 4 weeks after endothelial
denudation in the arteries of oletf rats. no and o−2 may have a role in the important underlying mechanisms by reducing the  xxxg2296xxx  levels.

introduction
the atherogenic process is characterized by an early
reduction in no (hayashi et al., 1989; chester et al., 1990).
coronary risk factors such as hyperlipidemia and diabetes are
known to impair no function, and this impairment becomes
severe as the number of risk factors increase (cayatte et al.,
1994; ignarro, 1989). in diabetes, large-artery ischemic disease
is a major problem, especially in the elderly, and complications
associated with other coronary risk factors are known to
increase ischemia and the growth of lesions (defronzo and

ferrannini, 1991). the restoration of impaired endothelial
function, shown by impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation
(edr) in the diabetic vessel, is important for the stabilization of
atheroma. however, the restoration of edr in patients with
atherosclerotic disease has not been consistently observed
(harrison et al., 1987; hayashi et al., 1999). clinical and
experimental evidence has not yet demonstrated sufficient
stabilization of diabetic vascular complications.
hypertension and diabetes mellitus are well-known coronary
risk factors, and control of blood pressure has been shown to be
as important as the control of blood glucose levels, as observed
in the ukpds study (sampson et al., 2002; guzik et al., 2000).
beta-blockade has been contraindicated for the diabetic patient
because it might cause prolongation of the hypoglycemic status,

t. hayashi et al. / life sciences 80 (2007) 592–599

and may worsen arteriosclerosis and thrombosis by alpha-stimulant
action. recently, however, many studies have reported that betablockade is an effective treatment for slowing the progression of
ischemic heart disease complicated with diabetes (hink et al.,
2001; shinozaki et al., 1999; warnholtz et al., 1999). alphabetablockade or  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  simulative  xxxg836xxx  blockade have been reported to
avoid the adverse effects described above as they reduce the
development of ischemic heart disease in patients with diabetes,
and the possibility of improvements in insulin resistance were also
reported (warnholtz et al., 1999; kagota et al., 2000). however,
the effects of  xxxg836xxx  antagonists on the diabetic vascular lesion
remain controversial. on the other hand,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  agonists are known
to improve endothelial function by increasing no release. we
investigated the effects of  xxxd458xxx  hydrochloride, a  xxxg836xxx  antagonist and a  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  mild agonist, on the development of vascular
lesions and function after endothelial denudation in type ii
diabetic rats.
materials and methods
chemicals
acetylcholine chloride (ach), prostaglandin f2alpha (pgf2alpha,
indomethacin,  xxxg875xxx  (gtpch-i, rate limiting
enzyme for bh4 synthesis, cofactor of no synthase), lmonomethyl arginine (l-nma, no synthase inhibitor) and lnitro arginine acetate ester (l-name, no synthase inhibitor) were
purchased from sigma chemical co. (st louis, mo). nitroglycerin
( xxxd2741xxx ) was obtained from nihon kayaku co. ltd. (tokyo, japan).
animals and treatment
twenty-four male otsuka long-evans tokushima fatty
(oletf) rats (with type ii diabetes and 28-weeks old) and
8 littermate long-evans tokushima otsuka (leto) rats (28weeks old) were obtained from the otsuka pharmaceutical
company (rao et al., 2002; ding et al., 2004), and they were
divided into four groups as follows: gp c, leto was fed regular
chow; gp dm, oletf rats fed regular chow; gp dm-c, oletf
rats fed regular chow with  xxxd458xxx  (100 mg/kg/day) treatment
by oral gavages; gp dm-a, oletf rats fed regular chow with
atenolol (25 mg/kg/day) treatment by oral gavages. the doses of
 xxxd458xxx  and atenolol were decided based on the clinical doses
in human and rat experiments. there were eight rats in each
group and all rats received treatment for 4 weeks after endothelial
denudation. the rats were housed with free access to water. all
experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional
guidelines for animal research. on day 3, right internal carotid
artery endothelial cells were removed by balloon injury. four
weeks after balloon injury, the rats were evaluated.
blood sampling and measurement of blood pressure
the following measurements were taken before and after
treatment: body weight, fasting plasma glucose and insulin
concentrations, and serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, highdensity lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol, and  xxxg2296xxx  levels. de-

593

termination of  xxxg2296xxx  was carried out by elisa kit (haluzik
et al., 1999). systolic blood pressure was measured in conscious
rats using a tail cuff (rat bp, softron co. ltd. tokyo, japan).
vascular response
four weeks after treatment, the rats were sacrificed by
exsanguinations after being anesthetized with pentobarbital
(50 mg/kg ip). both carotid arteries and aortas were isolated and
used in measuring the vascular responses. vascular responses
were investigated as described previously (hayashi et al., 1992).
briefly, aortae and carotid arteries were cut into 2-mm-wide
transverse rings. these were stretched to their optimal force,
which was pre-determined as the contraction observed in
response to 122 mm kcl, and were mounted in chambers filled
with krebs' henseleit solution at 37 °c. the response of aortic
rings to ach and  xxxd2741xxx  were determined under submaximal
contraction by pgf2alpha (2.6 × 10− 6 m). tone-related basal no
release and contractile responses to l-nma were assessed under
moderate tone (about 40% contraction with kcl) induced by
prostaglandin f2alpha (pgf2alpha) (0.8 × 10− 6 m) (hayashi et al., 1992;
haluzik et al., 1999). in some experiments, indomethacin
(5 × 10− 6 m) was added to the chambers to exclude any effect
from prostanoids.
measurement of nitrite and nitrate (no2−/no3−)
plasma nox levels (sum of nitrite and nitrate, no2− and no3−)
were measured using the no detector-hplc system (eno10;
eicom co., kyoto, japan), used as described previously
(hayashi et al., 2000).
detection of aortic superoxide anion (o2−) generation from
aorta
on day 25 after initiation of treatment, peritoneal macrophages were stimulated by the peritoneal injection of thioglycolate (stevenson et al., 1984). three days after the injection,
rats were exsanguinated and evaluated. production of o2− by the
vessel was assayed by measuring the intensity of chemiluminescence's probes in the presence of a cypridina luciferin
analog, 2-methyl-6-(p-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo
[1,2]-a pyrazine-3-one (mcla) (skatchkov et al., 1998). in
brief, the o2− generation signal from the 2-mm length of vessel
was detected by a luminescence reader (blr-201, aloka co.,
tokyo). to ensure the specificity of mcla to detect o2−, increasing concentrations of superoxide dismutase (sod) (1–
50 u/ml) were added to the tissues.
histological evaluation of atherosclerosis
sections of the aorta adjacent to segments tested for vascular
responses were examined (weiner et al., 1986). briefly, the
contours of the lumen and the internal elastic lamina were
traced. the mean surface involvement of atherosclerotic lesions
(intimal thickening) per vessel (extent) was calculated by
dividing the lesion circumference by the circumference of the

internal elastic lamina. the circumferences of the lesion and the
healthy region were defined as the circumferences of the respective parts of the internal elastic lamina. the area occupied
by atherosclerotic lesions (total lesion burden = size/thickness)
was determined as a percentage of the area bounded by the
lumen and internal elastic lamina for the luminal area.
immunohistochemical study
tissues were sectioned into 5-mum slices (esaki et al., 2000).
primary monoclonal antibodies (anti-macrophages, anti-smooth
muscle cells, anti-endothelial no synthase, anti-inducible no
synthase, or anti-nitrotyrosine) were applied. tissue sections
were incubated with biotinylated immunoglobulin and incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-labeled avidin solution (vecstatin
elite, vector lab.). negative controls included the substitution of
primary antibody with irrelevant antibodies. there were no crossreactions between anti-enos and anti-inos antibodies. the

numbers of antibody-positive cells were recorded for each antibody and analyzed statistically as described previously (esaki
et al., 2000). five samples were prepared from each rat.
statistics
data are presented as mean + sem. the student t-test was
used and kruskal–wallis 1-way anova was used for multiple
comparisons. p b 0.05 is considered significant. statistical calculations were performed using stat view software (version
5.01-sas institute, cary, nc).

of  xxxg2296xxx  were significantly increased in the dm and dm-a
groups, but no change was observed in the c and dm-c groups
(table 1). systolic blood pressure tended to be lower in the dma and dm-c groups than in the dm group, but there were no
significant differences among the four groups.

tone-related basal no release in the carotid artery without

in the dm and dm-a groups, but no change was observed

detection of plasma nox (no metabolites, no2− + no3− ) and
aortic superoxide anion generation
plasma nox levels (sum of no2− and no3−) were greater in the
dm-c and c groups than in the dm and dm-a groups (fig. 3, left
panel). the chemiluminescence signals generated by the
production of superoxide anions in the aorta increased in the
group dm rats compared with the leto group. superoxide
anion production was reduced in the dm-c group compared with
that in the dm and dm-a groups (fig. 3, right panel).
histological evaluation of atherosclerosis
in the dm and dm-a groups, intimal thickening was
observed in the right carotid artery, but little thickening was
seen in the dm-c group. few such changes were observed in the
aortae from the dm group (5.0 ± 1.2, 2.0 ± 0.6%), dm-c group
(2.9 ± 1.5, 1.3 ± 0.5%) and dm-a group (4.8 ± 1.6, 1.2 ± 0.6%).
intimal thickening was more evident in the endothelial-denuded
left carotid arteries of the dm and dm-a groups, and there
seemed to be some thickening in those of the dm-c and c
groups (fig. 4). however, there were no significant differences
between groups dm-c and the group c rats.
immunohistochemical study
monocytes and macrophages were found to be attached to
the endothelium and distributed only to a small extent in the
sub-intima of the dm rats (fig. 5, upper panel). a few smooth
muscle cells were found in the sub-intima in the dm and dm-a
groups, but not in those of the other two groups (data not
shown). some inos was found in the sub-intima of the
endothelial-denuded carotid arteries of the dm and dm-a rats,
but was absent from the other groups (fig. 5, lower panel).
peroxynitrite, as visualized by staining with nitrotyrosine, was
rarely present, but it was found in small concentrations in the
sub-intima of the endothelial-denuded carotid arteries of the
dm and dm-a groups, but not in the sub-intima of the other two
groups or of other arteries. the staining area was almost the
same as that shown to be positive for the inos antibody (data
not shown).
discussion
abnormal vascular endothelial function and intimal thickening (atheromatous changes) are common in patients with
diabetes mellitus, and increased superoxide production seems to
account for a significant proportion of the no reduction
associated with diabetes (vasquez-vivar et al., 1998; meininger
et al., 2000; du et al., 2001).
in the present study, there was little release of superoxide
anions from macrophages in the leto group; however, this
release was increased in the oletf rats, especially in those
treated with or without atenolol. however, this increase was not
seen in oleft rats treated with  xxxd458xxx .  xxxd458xxx  treatment
(group dm-c) partially restored the levels of superoxide anions
close to the control levels observed in the leto group. similar

597

trends were found for plasma  xxxg2296xxx  levels, as levels were
increased in the dm and dm-a groups but not in the dm-c
group, compared with the group c rats. furthermore, morphological changes in response to diabetes and no dysfunction
were not evident in the  xxxd458xxx  treatment group.
superoxide production by vascular tissues and its interaction
with  xxxd2738xxx  (no) have important roles in diabetic and
atherosclerotic vascular pathophysiologies (vasquez-vivar et al.,
1998; meininger et al., 2000; du et al., 2001; shinozaki et al.,
2000). abnormal vascular endothelial function and atherosclerosis are important features of diabetes mellitus, and experimental studies indicate that increased superoxide production accounts
for a significant proportion of the no reduction in vessels of
patients with diabetes (vasquez-vivar et al., 1998; hink et al.,
2001). increased plasma levels of  xxxg2296xxx  are found in patients
with diabetes, and  xxxg2296xxx  is known to promote atherogenic
processes and to inhibit endothelial function (hink et al., 2001;
ruan et al., 2002). the mechanisms by which  xxxg2296xxx  levels are
increased were not determined in this study, but we speculate that
diabetic changes may be involved. we evaluated the sources and
relative magnitude of superoxide production in arteries taken
from type ii diabetic rats with or without beta-blockade. the underlying mechanism by which superoxide production is
increased should be investigated, for example, whether enos
uncoupling is involved. our findings indicate two important and
potentially related mechanisms that may be responsible for these
functional deficits. first, the uncoupling of nos may be possible.
although enos in the vascular endothelium and inos in
macrophages produce no, they may be sources of superoxide
production under certain conditions, due to the enzymatic
“uncoupling” of l-arginine oxidation and oxygen reduction by
the oxygenase and reductase domains of enos, respectively
(vasquez-vivar et al., 1998). recent studies, including ours, have
suggested that reduced availability of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) may result in enos or inos uncoupling, which
in turn may be responsible for the imbalance between no
production and superoxide production in diabetic vascular
lesions (vasquez-vivar et al., 1998; du et al., 2001). as our
study using cultured endothelial cells has indicated, the
inactivation of gtpch-1, which is the rate limiting enzyme
for the production of bh4, might also be responsible. in this
study, we preliminarily investigated the gtpch-1 activity and
bh4 concentration in the blood vessels, and initial results indicate
inactivation of gtpchi-1 in the dm and dm-a groups, but not
in the c and dm-c groups (data not shown). high glucose levels
increase nos-dependent superoxide production in human
endothelial cells, and mediate enos dysfunction in endothelial
cells (meininger et al., 2000) and we observed that high glucose
easily cause enos uncoupling by inactivation of gtpch-1 in
cultured endothelial cells (miyazaki et al., in press). the other
possibility is that increased superoxide production in atherosclerosis and other pro-atherosclerotic states reduces no bioactivity
by a direct scavenging mechanism. expression of nadph
oxidases has been shown in vascular cells and macrophages in
atherosclerotic arteries (shinozaki et al., 2000; hink et al., 2001;
jian-mei li et al., 2002; meyer et al., 1999). in studies of experimental diabetes in rats and in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein

598

t. hayashi et al. / life sciences 80 (2007) 592–599

e-knockout mice, increased nad(p)h oxidase activity and nos
dysfunction were found to contribute to increased total vascular
superoxide production and reduced no bioactivity (laursen
et al., 2001). however, we assumed that  xxxd458xxx  does not work
via the regulation of superoxide-producing enzymes such as
nadph oxidase, however  xxxd458xxx  seems to enhance enos
activity via  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  stimulation (liao et al., 2004) and there are no
studies showing the relation between  xxxd458xxx  and nadph
oxidase as much as we know. landmark clinical trials such as
ukpds have demonstrated that the strict control of complicated
coronary risk factors such as hypertension are as important as the
control of plasma glucose levels in the prevention of ischemic
cardiovascular events. one of the common mechanisms underlying these treatments is improving or restoring endothelial
function such as no bioavailability (kakoki et al., 1999; burger
et al., 2000).  xxxg836xxx -blocker treatment is well-known to prevent the
complication of ischemic heart diseases in diabetes (cruickshank
jm. beta-blockers and diabetes: the bad guys come good.
cardiovasc drugs ther. 2002 sep; 16(5): 457–70.) although
chronic  xxxg836xxx -blocker treatment may cause adverse effects such as
prolongation of hypoglycemic loss of consciousness or peripheral
arterial occlusion,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -agonists mask these effects by improving
endothelial function due to increasing no bioavailability. the
results of this study may clarify that beta-blockers should be
indicated for some patients with diabetes.
in conclusion, we found that arteries from diabetic rats
produced high levels of superoxide.  xxxd458xxx , a  xxxg836xxx  inhibitor
with a  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  agonist, but not atenolol, a  xxxg836xxx -selective inhibitor,
improved endothelial function and prevented the atherosclerotic
morphological changes seen in diabetic rats regardless of
whether or not they were subjected to nos inhibition.
