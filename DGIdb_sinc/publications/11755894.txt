abstract
 xxxd134xxx  ( xxxd134xxx ; adolor corporation, exton, pa, usa) is a novel, peripherally restricted opioid antagonist. after oral
administration, it has activity specific to the gastrointestinal (gi) tract.  xxxd134xxx  has low systemic absorption and a high affinity for
␮-opioid receptors. in healthy subjects,  xxxd134xxx  antagonized loperamide-induced changes in gi transit and prevented morphine-induced
delays in oral-cecal transit time without antagonizing centrally mediated opioid effects, such as analgesia or pupillary constriction. in the
treatment of opioid naive patients who underwent surgery and received opioids for acute pain, oral  xxxd134xxx  (6.0 mg) improved the
management of postoperative ileus (poi) by shortening the time to achieve normal bowel function and, ultimately, hospital stay.
postoperative nausea and vomiting and the overall incidence of all gi side effects were reduced in patients treated with  xxxd134xxx  for
poi. analgesia was not compromised, because there were no changes in median opioid consumption or visual analog scale (vas) pain
scores in patients treated with  xxxd134xxx  versus patients treated with placebo. no drug-related side effects were observed in acute pain
postsurgical patients in the initial poi study. in patients treated with opioids for chronic pain or opioid addiction, lower doses of oral adl
8-2698 (0.5 to 3.0 mg) reversed opioid bowel dysfunction (obd) and normalized gi activity. these effects were evident without
compromising opioid analgesia or inducing central nervous system symptoms of withdrawal. some chronic opioid patients receiving
apparently supramaximal doses of  xxxd134xxx  (ⱖ3.0 mg) reported localized gi side effects, possibly indicative of a localized gi
withdrawal response. the most common side effects of  xxxd134xxx  in chronic pain patients with obd were abdominal pain, flatulence,
and diarrhea. these effects were not observed in most obd patients receiving lower doses of  xxxd134xxx . overall,  xxxd134xxx  was well
tolerated in clinical trials. further studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  xxxd134xxx  in clinical practice are in progress. © 2001

opioid analgesics are associated with severe and sometimes
treatment-limiting side effects, most notably opioid bowel
dysfunction (obd). obd is a problem that affects patients
treated with opioids for cancer pain and chronic nonmalignant pain, and those receiving methadone for opioid addiction. although obd commonly is referred to by its most
debilitating symptom, constipation, it is actually associated
with multiple gastrointestinal (gi) effects, including abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, and gastroesophageal reflux. persistent symptoms of obd can lead to further
complications, such as nausea and vomiting, fecal impaction, and impaired absorption of drugs [1].
the pharmacologic effects of opioids in the gi tract
include (1) decreased gastric motility, (2) inhibition of small
intestine and large intestine propulsion, (3) delayed oral* xxxd134xxx  is the official usan name adopted as of press time.

cecal transit time, (4) impaired ability to defecate, and (5)
increased fluid absorption from bowel contents [2]. the
development of obd has been attributed to several mechanisms involving both peripheral and central opioid receptors. evidence suggests a predominant role of peripheral
opioid receptors in the development of obd [2– 4]. of the
3 most prominent opioid receptor subtypes, ␮, ␬, and ␦, the
␮-opioid receptor is the principal receptor involved in pain
management with most currently marketed opioid analgesic
drugs [5]. opioids used in pain management maintain selectivity for the ␮-opioid receptor at normal therapeutic
doses [5]. however, stimulation of the ␮-opioid receptor
also results in decreased gi motility [5]. high concentrations of opioid receptors have been found throughout the gi
tract [6,7], and activation of these receptors by opioid analgesics has a direct local effect on bowel function [3,8].
central opioid receptors appear to play a minor role in
the pathogenesis of obd [9]. studies in rats show that
inhibition of gi transit by morphine results primarily from
direct action on gut opioid sites [10].

larly vulnerable to impairments in gi motility as a result of
the occurrence of postoperative ileus (poi) and opioidinduced gi side effects [11–13]. poi is a disorder of the gi
tract that occurs after abdominal or other surgery and affects
all parts of the gi tract [14]. the symptoms of poi are
similar to those of obd and include abdominal distention,
lack of bowel sounds, gas and fluid accumulation in the
bowel, delayed passage of flatus, and impaired defecation
[15,16]. poi may result in added pain and discomfort after
surgery, delayed enteral feedings, impaired absorption of
orally administered drugs, increased postoperative nausea
and vomiting, and delayed mobilization and recovery, all of
which may increase patient morbidity while increasing hospital stays and health-care costs [16 –19].
the primary mechanism of poi appears to involve inhibitory neural reflexes within the sympathetic nervous system. of particular importance is the efferent sympathetic
reflex that inhibits motility in the intestinal tract [16,19,20].
the use of epidural local anesthetics appears to block these
reflexes, reducing the duration of poi. the use of epidural
opioids, however, does not reduce the duration of poi,
despite their analgesic effects [21–24]. inflammation secondary to surgery is another causative factor in poi, with
the degree of ileus directly correlating to the intestinal
inflammatory response [17].
the impact of opioid use on poi has been a focus of
recent investigations. it has been shown that the duration of
poi is influenced by the reduced gi motility associated with
postoperative opioid use [11–13,25]. in addition, several
studies have identified the release of endogenous opioids
after surgery; however, the contribution of endogenous opioids to poi has not been clearly determined [26 –29].
current approaches to the management of obd and poi
provide less than optimal relief of symptoms for patients
with these conditions. although the use of laxatives and
other nonpharmacologic interventions (dietary alterations,
increased fluid intake, and increased mobilization) are the
standard of care for patients treated with opioids, a substantial number of patients will not obtain adequate relief of
their symptoms as a result of the refractory nature of obd
[30,31]. similarly, treatment protocols that incorporate the
use of nasogastric suction, early mobilization, early enteral
feeding, prokinetic agents, and epidural local anesthetics as
well as the use of less invasive surgical procedures have not
consistently demonstrated effectiveness in preventing the
symptoms of poi [32]. clearly, newer treatment strategies
are needed to manage the symptoms associated with obd
and poi.
recent findings demonstrating the predominant role of
peripheral opioid receptors in pathogenesis of obd and
identifying opioid receptor-related contributions to poi
have prompted investigation into the use of opioid antagonists to manage these gi disorders. the use of tertiary
opioid antagonists, such as oral naloxone or nalmefene
glucuronide, primarily has been limited by their propensity
to cross the blood– brain barrier and precipitate opioid with-

drawal or reverse analgesia [33,34]. the lack of selectivity
for peripheral versus central opioid receptors with the tertiary opioid antagonists has led to the development of peripherally restricted ␮ opioid antagonists, such as  xxxd2614xxx , a systemically available peripheral antagonist
[35,36], and  xxxd134xxx  ( xxxd134xxx ; adolor corporation,
exton, pa, usa), which has both low systemic absorption
and a limited ability to enter the central nervous system
(cns). the potential benefit of these agents is their ability
to antagonize opioid-mediated changes in gi motility without altering centrally mediated opioid effects, such as analgesia. early clinical studies with  xxxd2614xxx  show
promise in the drug’s ability to improve gi transit time in
patients with obd without reversing analgesia or inducing
symptoms of withdrawal [35,36]. preliminary studies investigating the use of  xxxd134xxx  to normalize bowel function
in patients with obd and to reduce the severity and duration of poi are presented in this article.

chemistry
 xxxd134xxx  (formerly known as  xxxd134xxx ; eli lilly &
company, indianapolis, in, usa) is a novel, peripherally
restricted  xxxd134xxx  ␮-opioid antagonist (fig. 1) [37].  xxxd134xxx  is a
small, totally synthetic molecule ( xxxd134xxx  䡠 2 h2o). its
moderately large molecular weight, zwitterionic form, and
polarity limit gi absorption and prevent penetration of the
blood– brain barrier [37,38].

pharmacology
in vivo and in vitro,  xxxd134xxx  is a potent antagonist
of peripheral ␮-receptors. radioligand-binding assays have
confirmed the high affinity of  xxxd134xxx  for the ␮-opioid
receptor (ki ⫽ 0.77 nmol/l) and lower affinities for ␦ (ki ⫽
4.4 nmol/l) and ␬ (ki ⫽ 40 nmol/l) receptors [37,38]. adl
8-2698 is more potent than naloxone (ki ⫽ 3.7 nmol/l) as
a ␮-opioid receptor antagonist [38]. in animals, adl
8-2698 antagonizes centrally mediated, morphine-induced
analgesia only at relatively high doses, with very high
plasma concentrations needed to cross the blood– brain barrier. after intravenous (iv) administration,  xxxd134xxx  is
approximately 200 times more potent at blocking peripheral
versus central ␮-receptors [38]. after oral administration,
 xxxd134xxx  is also highly active.  xxxd134xxx  was evaluated in animal studies to measure its peripheral and central
␮-opioid receptor antagonist activities [37]. peripheral antagonist activity was determined by the compound’s ability
to precipitate diarrhea in morphine-dependent mice, and its
central antagonist activity was measured by determining its
ability to antagonize morphine-induced analgesia. after oral
administration, the dose calculated to produce diarrhea in
50% of the mice treated (ed50) was 1.1 mg/kg, which was

inhibited morphine-induced constipation in the mouse charcoal meal test without reversing analgesia. the drug prevented morphine-induced inhibition of transit for ⱖ8 hours
[38].
pharmacokinetics and metabolism
in dogs, iv administration of  xxxd134xxx  provided
dose-dependent increases in peak plasma concentrations

and plasma area under the concentration-time curve [38].
however, as a result of poor systemic absorption, oral doses
ⱕ100 mg/kg produced low plasma concentrations (mean
cmax ⫽ 92.9 ng/ml), which resulted in an oral bioavailability of approximately 0.03%. the half-life of  xxxd134xxx  is
estimated to be approximately 10 minutes after iv administration in dogs and rabbits [38].
 xxxd134xxx  has been shown to be a peripherally restricted opioid antagonist that does not penetrate the cns.
whole-body autoradiography studies in rats were conducted

to determine the distribution of iv and oral  xxxd134xxx 
throughout the body (fig. 2) [39]. after iv administration,
 xxxd134xxx  distributed to most parts of the body except the
spinal cord and brain. confirming autoradiographic studies
have been reported by zimmerman et al [38], who reported
that most radiocarbon associated with an orally administered dose of [14c] xxxd134xxx  is detected throughout the
gi tract, much of it within the gut wall, with minimal
evidence of distribution to the blood or other tissue in rats.

toxicology
acute and subacute toxicology studies revealed that adl
8-2698 has a large therapeutic index [38]. over a 30-day
period, peak plasma levels in dogs were proportional to iv
doses and exceeded 4,000 ng/ml after a 2-mg/kg iv dose. oral
doses ⱕ200 mg/kg in rats and ⱕ100 mg/kg in dogs were
evaluated in 6-month safety studies. neither study revealed
important toxicologic findings. in addition, no reproductive or
developmental safety issues were identified in preliminary in
vitro and in vivo studies in animals [38].

fig. 3. early clinical study [40]. in this balanced, 4-way double-blind
crossover study, healthy male subjects (n ⫽ 8) received oral doses of
loperamide (8 mg) or matching placebo twice daily. loperamide-treated
subjects also received oral doses of  xxxd134xxx  (2.4 mg or 24 mg) or
matching placebo 3 times daily for 4 days. radiopaque markers were
administered orally on the morning of the first 3 treatment days of each
cycle; the location of the markers was determined via abdominal x-ray on
treatment day 4 to determine colonic transit time. *p ⬍0.01 compared with
placebo–placebo control.

clinical data
early clinical trials
based on preclinical animal studies that demonstrated
the ability of  xxxd134xxx  to selectively antagonize peripheral opioid receptors throughout the gut, several phase 1
studies were conducted in humans to characterize the safety
of orally administered  xxxd134xxx  in healthy human volunteers and the effects of  xxxd134xxx  on gi motility and
transit time after the administration of systemic opioids.
these studies also established whether  xxxd134xxx  would
act centrally to limit the analgesia or pupillary constriction
associated with opioid therapy.
an early clinical trial conducted in 8 healthy male subjects (28 to 54 years of age) evaluated whether  xxxd134xxx 
could reverse or prevent the actions of loperamide, a poorly
absorbed ␮-opioid agonist, on gi transit [40]. in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced crossover study,
subjects were administered either loperamide 8 mg twice
daily or placebo (control group). as anticipated, there was a
2-fold increase in colonic transit time in loperamide-treated
subjects compared with the control group (p ⬍0.01; fig. 3).
subjects who received loperamide also received additional
doses of placebo or  xxxd134xxx  2.4 mg or 24 mg 3 times
daily over the course of 4 days. a 3-day washout separated
each treatment interval. both the 2.4-mg and 24-mg doses
completely prevented the loperamide-induced changes in gi
transit.
the effect of  xxxd134xxx  on morphine-induced delays
in oral-cecal transit time (upper gi transit), as measured by
the lactulose/hydrogen breath test, was evaluated in a dou-

healthy volunteers (n ⫽ 14) received the following treatments on 3
separate days: oral and intravenous placebo (control), oral placebo and
intravenous morphine (0.05 mg/kg), and oral  xxxd134xxx  (4 mg) and
intravenous morphine (0.05 mg/kg). oral-cecal transit time was measured
by the lactulose/hydrogen breath test. *p ⫽ 0.005 for morphine/placebo vs

from 69 minutes to 103 minutes (p ⫽ 0.005; fig. 4) [42].

fig. 5.  xxxd134xxx  does not reverse morphine analgesia [42]. healthy subjects (n ⫽ 45) undergoing third molar extraction received oral (po) doses of adl
8-2698 (4-mg total dose) or placebo along with intravenous (iv) morphine (0.15 mg/kg) or saline solution in a double-blind procedure. morphine or saline
solution doses were administered after patients reported moderate or severe pain (mean visual analog scale [vas] score ⫽ 50 mm). morphine with and
without  xxxd134xxx  decreased vas scores and was different from the placebo-saline solution group (p ⬍0.002).

delays in lower gi transit without antagonizing opioid effects in the cns was evaluated in a similar randomized,
controlled crossover trial involving 13 healthy subjects [39,
43]. each subject received placebo or oral  xxxd134xxx  3
mg 3 times daily and 30 mg oral morphine twice daily for
4 days, followed by a washout period of 1 week and then 4
days of the crossover treatment. the following efficacy
assessments were made after each treatment period: (1) gi
transit, as measured by the weighted sum of radiopaque
marker transit scores in the colon; (2) cold pressor pain
scores; and (3) pupil size. when administered with morphine and compared with placebo,  xxxd134xxx  was associated with (1) a significantly faster gi transit time, (2)
increased stool number, and (3) increased stool weight
(p ⬍0.05 for all 3 factors). in contrast, coadministration of
 xxxd134xxx  did not antagonize the central effects of morphine as measured by analgesia or the magnitude of pupil
constriction.
a study to assess the effects of  xxxd134xxx  on morphine-induced analgesia and pupillary constriction was conducted in 45 patients (24 male, 21 female) who underwent
dental surgery [42]. the patients were randomly assigned in
a double-blind fashion to 1 of 3 treatment groups (n ⫽ 15
per group): (1) oral  xxxd134xxx  (4 mg) and iv morphine
(0.15 mg/kg), (2) oral placebo and iv morphine (0.15 mg/
kg), or (3) oral placebo and iv placebo. morphine significantly reduced visual analog scale (vas) pain scores and
categorical pain scores, and increased pain relief scores. all
pain scores were unaffected by administration of adl
8-2698 before and after surgery (fig. 5) [42]. additionally,

 xxxd134xxx  had no effect on morphine-induced pupillary
constriction.
these results support the theory that administration of
 xxxd134xxx  during opioid therapy normalizes bowel motility and gi transit time without reversing centrally mediated opioid effects.
opioid bowel dysfunction
once it appeared that  xxxd134xxx  could prevent or
reverse the gi effects of opioids without affecting analgesia
in healthy subjects, the efficacy and safety of  xxxd134xxx 
were evaluated in patients receiving opioid therapy for
chronic pain (n ⫽ 67) or methadone for opioid addiction
(n ⫽ 34) [39]. all patients were receiving stable doses of an
opioid and were having symptoms of obd, with constipation being the primary complaint. opioid therapy consisted
of varying doses of (1) hydrocodone and acetaminophen, (2)
oxycodone and acetaminophen, (3) codeine and acetaminophen, (4) fentanyl, (5) extended-release oral morphine, (6)
extended-release oxycodone, (7) tramadol, (8) meperidine,
(9) propoxyphene, or (10) methadone (40 to 100 mg/day).
the duration of opioid therapy ranged from 1 week to ⱖ10
years. the patients enrolled in the study were divided into 2
treatment groups. the first was a parallel group single-dose
study (n ⫽ 75) in which patients received a single dose of
placebo or 1 of 3 doses of  xxxd134xxx  (0.5, 1.5, or 3.0 mg).
the second study was a progressive dosing “forced titration” study (n ⫽ 26) in which patients received placebo for
4 successive days or increasing doses of  xxxd134xxx , once

in the single-dose study, dose-related increases in the

treated with all doses of  xxxd134xxx  compared with placebo (fig. 8). side effects were minimal with  xxxd134xxx ,
particularly at the 0.5-mg and 1.5-mg doses. some patients
in the highest dose group (3 mg) reported loose stools,
cramps, and/or diarrhea, possibly indicating a localized gutspecific opioid withdrawal. no patients showed signs of
cns opioid withdrawal or reversal of analgesia.
during the 4-day progressive dosing study, mean stool
weight increased in patients treated with  xxxd134xxx  on
each day up until day 3 (fig. 9). there was no further
increase on day 4, but rather, a slight reduction in mean
stool weight from that observed on day 3. this plateau in

effect was attributed to elimination of retained constipationrelated feces on previous days and subsequent return to
more normal stool volume by the fourth day. substantially
lower stool weights were reported on each of the 4 days for
patients who received placebo.
in a preliminary (n ⫽ 7) dose-escalation study, 1 longterm opioid subject reported increasing bowel movement
frequencies after successive 0.25-mg and 1.0-mg doses of
 xxxd134xxx , and then reported severe abdominal cramps,
nausea, emesis, and multiple bowel movements starting
approximately 1.5 to 2 hours after receiving a 3-mg dose of
 xxxd134xxx . the abdominal cramping lasted approximately 3.25 hours. as a precaution, the subject was hospitalized for symptomatic treatment and observation and dis-

charged the following day without sequelae. the subject did
not report a reduction in analgesia or any other cns signs
of opioid withdrawal.
overall,  xxxd134xxx  improved bowel function in patients treated with opioids for chronic pain and in patients
treated with methadone for opioid withdrawal. the selectivity of  xxxd134xxx  for the gi tract was demonstrated by
the absence of reports of interference with centrally mediated opioid effects. further studies are in progress to evaluate the durability and safety of the  xxxd134xxx  response
with longer-term treatments.
postoperative ileus
because the use of opioids postoperatively can delay
recovery from poi, a study was conducted to determine
whether administration of  xxxd134xxx  could antagonize
opioid effects on ␮-receptors in the gi tract and reduce the
duration or intensity of poi. a total of 78 patients who
underwent gynecologic or colorectal surgery were included
in this phase 2 efficacy and dose-ranging study [39]. the
surgeries included partial colectomy (n ⫽ 15), simple hysterectomy (n ⫽ 37), and radical hysterectomy (n ⫽ 26), all
of which involved significant bowel manipulation. the
mean age of the patients was 53 years (range 27 to 79). most
patients included in the study were women (n ⫽ 72), largely
as a result of the number of hysterectomies that were performed.
for pain control, all patients received morphine or meperidine via patient-controlled analgesia. patients were
treated with placebo (n ⫽ 26),  xxxd134xxx  1 mg (n ⫽ 26),
or  xxxd134xxx  6 mg (n ⫽ 26), with the first dose administered 2 hours preoperatively and then twice daily beginning the day after surgery until hospital discharge for maximum of 7 days of treatment. the study endpoints were (1)
pain control and opioid consumption; (2) nausea, bloating,
and abdominal cramping; (3) time to tolerability of oral
liquids and solid foods; (4) time to first flatus; (5) time to
first bowel movement; and (6) time to hospital discharge.
in the patients who received the 6 mg twice-daily doses
of  xxxd134xxx , mean time to first bowel movement was
reduced by approximately 2 days (fig. 10a), mean time to
a solid diet was reduced by 1.3 days (fig. 10b), and mean
time to discharge was reduced by 1.4 days (fig. 10c). after
treatment with  xxxd134xxx , all time-to-event responses
were improved dose dependently and were statistically significant compared with placebo (figs. 10 to 13). postoperative nausea, vomiting, and the overall incidence of all gi
side effects were substantially reduced in patients treated
with  xxxd134xxx  compared with placebo (fig. 14). the
incidences of all gi side effects were reduced with increasing doses of  xxxd134xxx .
median total morphine doses or morphine-equivalent
doses of meperidine were approximately 71 mg for all
treatment groups (fig. 15a). no statistical difference in

vas pain scores was reported between the  xxxd134xxx  and
placebo groups (fig. 15b).
in summary, abdominal surgery patients who received
opioid analgesia for postsurgical pain and who were treated
with  xxxd134xxx  had (1) more rapid normalization of
bowel function, (2) fewer gi adverse effects, and (3) were
discharged from the hospital sooner than those who received placebo.

safety of  xxxd134xxx 
a phase 1 ascending-dose study evaluated the clinical
safety and dose-related side effects of  xxxd134xxx  in 44
healthy volunteers [39]. this single-center, double-blind,

placebo-controlled trial began with a 3-week screening period, followed by a 4-day oral dosing period in which
subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n ⫽ 5) or
 xxxd134xxx  0.25, 0.5, 2.0, 6.0, or 18.0 mg 3 times daily
(n ⫽ 4, 11, 9, 9, and 6, respectively). the most common
adverse events reported in healthy volunteers treated with
 xxxd134xxx  were dose related and included abdominal pain
(31%), flatulence (31%), and diarrhea (21%). nausea, polyuria, and nervousness also were reported. side effects were
dose related and occurred infrequently at lower doses. no
serious adverse events were reported. abnormal laboratory
values were reported in 2 patients; both patients had clinically significant elevations in liver function tests (aspartate
aminotransferase,  xxxg941xxx , and lactic
[acid] dehydrogenase; maximum increases of 2.5 to 4.0

times the upper limits of normal) that subsequently normalized without intervention. no dose-related hepatotoxicity
was reported. overall, this study confirmed that adl
8-2698 is generally well tolerated at doses ⱕ54 mg daily
over 4 days without the occurrence of serious adverse
events.
aside from the localized gi side effects (abdominal
cramps, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) experienced by some
chronic opioid patients receiving apparently supramaximal
doses (3 mg or higher) of  xxxd134xxx , no other serious
adverse events were reported in initial phase 1 and phase 2
studies of patients treated with  xxxd134xxx  for obd or
poi. including additional phase 2 obd and poi studies
completed through the end of august 2001, 14 of 444
subjects receiving active drug doses have reported 22 seri-

ous adverse events, only 2 of which (nausea, abdominal
cramping) were considered by the study investigators to be
possibly related to  xxxd134xxx .
as anticipated, in patients treated with  xxxd134xxx  and
opioids, improvements in gi side effects were reported. in
addition,  xxxd134xxx  does not appear to reverse opioid
analgesia in patients taking short-term or long-term opioids
and does not provoke symptoms of cns withdrawal in
patients treated with opioids for chronic pain or opioid
addiction [39 – 41].

surgery patients, which may ultimately shorten hospital
stays.  xxxd134xxx  is well tolerated and reduces opioidassociated gi side effects in patients treated for poi. adl
8-2698 also appears to reverse obd and normalize bowel
function in patients receiving long-term opioids. opioid
analgesia was not affected by administration of adl
8-2698 to patients with acute or chronic pain. there were no
reports of cns opioid withdrawal or reversal of other centrally mediated opioid effects, such as analgesia or pupillary
constriction. further efficacy and safety studies are in
progress to confirm the role of  xxxd134xxx  in the management of obd and poi in clinical practice.

conclusion
 xxxd134xxx  is a novel, orally administered, peripherally
restricted opioid antagonist that has activity specific to the
gi tract. preclinical studies in rats and dogs show that adl
8-2698 has low systemic absorption with an oral bioavailability of approximately 0.03%, and in vitro studies show
that it has high affinity for ␮-opioid receptors.  xxxd134xxx 
appears to reduce the duration of poi in major abdominal
