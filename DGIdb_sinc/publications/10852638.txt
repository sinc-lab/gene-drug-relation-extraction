abstract

matrix metalloproteases (mmp) are a family of enzymes that contribute to the
degradation of the extracellular matrix. the destruction of the extracellular matrix
eventually leads to tumour invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. realising this
mechanism of action, there is tremendous potential for inhibitors of mmp in
cancer therapy. extensive preclinical data have shown that administration of matrix metalloprotease inhibitors (mmpi) to different animal models results in a
reduction in primary tumour growth as well as in the number and size of metastatic
lesions. based on promising preclinical studies, synthetic mmpi have been developed and taken into clinical trials. these include marimastat, bay-129566,
 xxxd468xxx , prinomastat (ag-3340),  xxxd3088xxx  and metastat (col-3).
these drugs are all in different stages of clinical development, ranging from phase
i to iii. in general, musculoskeletal problems, such as joint stiffness and pain in
hands, arms and shoulders seem to affect most patients in varying degrees, depending on the dose and type of compound administered. in addition to single
agent therapy, several mmpi have entered trials of combination therapy. the
objective of combining chemotherapy with an mmpi is to potentiate tumour
cytotoxicity as well as to reduce the size and number of metastatic lesions. several
compounds have entered phase iii combination therapy trials, but it is still too
early to report any data. there is ongoing research in correlating biological endpoints, such as levels of mmp and markers of angiogenesis with clinical response.
as the field of mmp and their inhibitors continues to mature, its role in cancer
therapeutics will be better defined.

matrix metalloproteases (mmp) constitute a family of at least 16 zinc and calcium containing proteolytic enzymes that play an integral role in the
physiology of the extracellular matrix (ecm).
within the complex milieu of the ecm, several different processes are occurring, all with the common
goal of maintaining appropriate tissue function and
homeostasis. because of the pivotal role the mmp
play in this system of checks and balances, intensive focus in recent years in this field has led inves-

tigators to the identify the importance of several enzymes in cancer progression. one of the roles mmp
play results in the degradation of the basement membrane and in the remodelling of the ecm. in pathological processes such as cancer, specific mmp may
be recruited to permit primary tumour growth and
metastatic disease. activation of specific mmp has
been implicated in both tissue invasiveness, metastases and angiogenesis.

have been developed (fig. 1). encouraging preclinical and early clinical data have stimulated the
study of mmpi in large scale clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of these novel compounds in patients with different types of cancer.
1. rationale for the use of matrix
metalloprotease inhibitors (mmpi)
malignant cells injure patients by local tumour
growth and by metastasis to different sites in the
body. unfortunately, many patients present for the
first time with disease that has already metastasised. the metastatic process usually commences
with damage to the basement membrane and malignant cells traversing through the basement
membrane and the stroma of the ecm, entering the
general circulation, penetrating between endothelial lining cells at another tissue site, invading
through the basement membrane once again and
proliferating as a new mass, and recruiting new blood
vessels to support further growth. the interstitial
stroma consists of various proteins: collagens, proteoglycans, gelatins, laminin and fibronectin. the
enzymes involved in degrading the previously
mentioned enzymes include serine proteases, cysteine proteases, aspartyl proteases and mmp.[1] it
has become clear that the interstitial stroma is not
a passive structural support, but rather, a metabolically active tissue.
there are 3 distinct classes of mmp by target:
collagenases, stromelysins and gelatinases. mmp
are secreted into the ecm in a proenzyme form,
which requires activation by other enzymes. one
class of activators is the enzyme membrane typematrix metalloprotease ( xxxg1423xxx ).[2]  xxxg1423xxx 
have a transmembrane domain which is essential
in activating the prommp.
to date, there are 16 known distinct members of
the mmp family. all members share a highly conserved zinc binding catalytic domain and a specific
sequence in the prodomain integral to maintaining
a latent state in the ecm.[3] they differ in substrate
specificity, in inhibitor binding and in matrix binding. table i lists the various members of the mmp
family by class, number and substrate specificity.

1045

there is a considerable amount of overlap between
substrate specificity and some substrates are still
unknown.
the process of ecm remodelling is under complex control. one of the mechanisms to counteract the
activity of mmps is a natural tissue inhibitor, known
as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (timp). the
timp family consists of 4 known enzymes, all possessing 12 conserved cysteine residues.[4] timp
are not proenzymes and therefore do not require
activation by another enzyme. inhibition of mmp
occurs by covalent binding at specific domains. the
complex balance of effects for mmp,  xxxg1423xxx 
and timp is altered in disease states and provides
a novel therapeutic target.
gross[5] in 1962 first implicated mmp in the
dissolution of the tadpole tail. since then, the role
of mmp in non-malignant human diseases, such as
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, has been
studied with increasing focus. mmp as a whole
may be essential for normal growth and development. for example,  xxxg1440xxx  is secreted by osteoclasts and is believed to play a role in normal bone
growth and resorption.[6] other physiological roles
established for mmp include ovulation and trophoblast implantation. however, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,  xxxg1437xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  have been
isolated in the synovium.[7,8] interestingly, other
diseases including inflammatory bowel disease,
chronic liver disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm,
bronchiectasis and wound healing have all shown
elements of mmp overexpression in the affected
sites.[9-13] mmp overexpression resulting in the
disorganisation of tissue function may play an important part in the pathogenesis of these disease
states.
in neoplasia, mmp are involved in both primary
tumour growth and in metastatic tumour development. in particular, overexpression of  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx  has been evaluated extensively in different
tumours such as breast, colon, gastric, head and
neck, prostate and lung cancer. in colorectal cancer,  xxxg1428xxx  (both in pro and active forms) and
 xxxg1440xxx  are overexpressed compared with normal
mucosa.[14] the active form of  xxxg1428xxx  seems to

only be overexpressed in cancer tissue, not normal
colon mucosal tissue. similarly, in gastric cancer, active  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  were found to be expressed
in 59% of cancer tissue compared with 23% of normal tissue.[15] in pancreatic cancer,  xxxg1418xxx ,  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  were studied, but only  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx  are found to be overexpressed (in 75% of
the tumours).[16]
for gastrointestinal tumours in general,  xxxg1428xxx 
and  xxxg1440xxx  overexpression appear to correlate with
tumour stage, tumour aggressiveness and poor prognoses. similar results have been published in studies of cervical, bladder and lung tumours.[17-19]
sato et al.[20] have shown expression of  xxxg1423xxx 
in lung, colon, head and neck tumours. since the
identification of  xxxg1423xxx  and timp, studies evaluating the interplay of all 3 families in cancer
growth and metastases have been undertaken.

although there is clear overexpression of mmp
in tumours, there is still a great variability in the
levels of overexpression of mmp in different tumour types. fiebig et al.[21] studied the expression
patterns of  xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1437xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  in panel
of 47 human tumour xenografts. there was  xxxg1428xxx 
overexpression mostly in soft tissue sarcomas
(100%), melanomas (84%), testicular carcinoma
(53%) and bladder (26%).  xxxg1437xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  were
weakly expressed. such a report is suggestive that
 xxxg1428xxx  is a reasonable therapeutic target in the
above mentioned tumour types. however, so far
there have been no studies correlating patients with
stable disease with the profile of enzymes in their
tumours. such studies clearly need to be performed
in the future to provide a more select group of patients along with better potential therapeutic targets.

metalloprotease inhibitors in cancer therapy

in addition to the variability of expression in the
tumour types, there are also differences in enzyme
expression in primary tumours compared with
their metastatic lesions.
2. evidence from preclinical
studies of mmpi
evidence for the role of mmp inhibitors in primary tumour growth has been provided by preclinical data involving the synthetic mmpi  xxxd287xxx .
 xxxd287xxx  is a broad spectrum mmpi with activity
against  xxxg1418xxx ,  xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1437xxx ,  xxxg1438xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx . because of poor oral bioavailability,  xxxd287xxx  has been administered intraperitoneally and
intrapleurally in several different models. in a xenograft model of human ovarian cancer, nude mice
with intraperitoneally implanted ovarian cancer
cells received either batimistat or placebo.[22] significantly less tumour in the ascitic fluid and a
significant increase in survival were seen in the
batimistat-treated mice compared with the control
group. batimistat was also tested in a xenograft
model of human colorectal cancer cells.[23] there
was a 50% reduction in primary tumour growth in
the treatment group (which had implanted tumour
in the intestinal wall) compared with the control
group. this reduction was associated with a significant increase in survival. in a murine melanoma
model,  xxxd287xxx  produced a 33% reduction of tumour growth when treatment was initiated 11 to 19
days after tumour inoculation.[24] a reduction in
primary tumour growth with administration of intraperitoneal  xxxd287xxx  has been shown in several
other models, such as a xenograft model of breast
cancer.[25]  xxxd287xxx  in combination with docetaxel
was found to potentiate the antitumour activity in
a mouse forestomach carcinoma model.[26] the
docetaxel plus  xxxd287xxx  combination showed
synergy in the inhibition of primary tumour growth
and lung metastases compared with docetaxel or
 xxxd287xxx  alone.
the role of mmpi in the metastatic process was
initially thought to be only the inhibition of tumour
extravasation. for example, if a cancer cell overexpresses certain degradative mmp, then an inhib© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

itor would stop that process and therefore stop tumour extravasation. however, intravital videomicroscopy has clarified this process in real time.
mouse melanoma cells genetically engineered to
overexpress timp-1 were injected into chick embryos.[27] the expected result from overexpression
of timp-1 was defective extravasation. however,
the study showed successful extravasation of the cancer cells. unexpectedly, there was reduced growth
in the new target tissue. this finding shed new light
on one mechanism of metastatic tumour reduction
by mmpi.
these new discoveries led to further studies where
the number and size of the metastatic lesions as
well as primary tumour growth were evaluated. bay129566 is a second generation, oral, biphenyl mmpi,
selective for  xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1437xxx ,  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1422xxx .
flynn et al.[28] administered oral doses of bay-129566
to scid ( xxxg1176xxx ) mice
with surgically attached hct-116 human colon tumour. not only was primary tumour size reduced
by 35% in the treated group, but there was a 50%
reduction in the overall incidence of metastasis, with
a 60% decrease in liver metastases and a 46% decrease in pancreatic metastases. in addition, the actual size of the metastatic tumour lesions were
smaller in the treated group than the control group.
this reduction may reflect the additional mechanism
of inhibition of angiogenesis in metastatic tumour
sites.
a new macrocyclic inhibitor (a-177430) was
shown to decrease primary tumour growth and
metastases not only by inhibiting angiogenesis, but
also by promoting apoptosis in a model of rate
prostate cancer.[29] these results are encouraging,
especially in terms of enhancing cytotoxicity of the
primary tumour by combining mmpi with chemotherapeutic agents.
based on data supporting overexpression of
mmp in different cancer tissues and preclinical studies showing reduction of primary tumour growth and
distant metastatic disease in various tumours with
synthetic mmpi either via apoptosis or antiangiogenic mechanisms, new synthetic mmpi have
been developed and taken into a clinical trials.

3. study end-points
in general, these mmpi can be administered to
mice at very high doses before significant toxicity
or lethality is seen (>100 to 500 mg/kg). they are
not mutagenic in ames tests. if doses of these
agents are escalated, they will affect larger families
of proteases, eventually including tumour necrosis
factor (tnf)alpha converting enzyme ( xxxg63xxx ) and
presumably provoking inflammatory responses.
one example that may be clinically important is the
enzyme which processes  xxxg2296xxx , a member of the
adamalysin family. the shedding of other cell surface molecules, including tnf receptors, interleukin receptors,  xxxd3135xxx , transforming growth
factor (tgf)alpha and l-selectin may also be processed by similar metalloproteases. since shedding
of these receptors may down-regulate the activity
of the membrane bound protein, inhibiting the
metalloproteases responsible for shedding may
circumvent complex systems controlling the inflammatory response. the ideal drug exposure to
provide relatively selective mmp inhibition is undefined, but pharmacokinetically targeted trials to
achieve steady state or trough plasma concentrations of free drug that are 1 to 10 times greater than
the ic50 for the targeted enzymes have been undertaken.[30]
phase i trials included analysis of tumour markers, particularly prostate specific antigen (psa) in
prostate trials. although a reduced rate of rise in
psa levels to <25% over 4 weeks in 50 to 70% of
patients with dosages ranging from 5 to 25mg
twice daily were thought to suggest benefit, others
have questioned this approach.[31] other tumour
markers such as ca-125, ca 19-9 are utilised as
secondary biomarkers to predict clinical activity.
other studies correlating a biological effect of a
drug with clinical response have been reported.
bazzett et al.[32] measured urinary levels of mmp
in patients with endometrial and ovarian carcinoma. by using gelatin zymography, the study
showed that all advanced stages of endometrial carcinoma were positive for  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx 
while only half of advanced staged ovarian carcinoma were positive. similarly, koshiba et al.[33]

also used gelatin zymography, and reported that
pancreatic carcinoma tissue specimens had significantly higher  xxxg1428xxx  level in more advanced
stage tumours (t3) compared with earlier stage tumours (t1). the  xxxg1428xxx  level was also higher in
patients with nodal or distant metastatic disease compared with those without. however, gelatin zymography is a relatively new technique and needs to
be further developed. another potential biochemical marker correlates bone turnover with extent of
metastatic bone disease. markers such as serum
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (b-ap), serum
levels of the collagen cross-link associated ctelopeptide (ictp), and urine concentration of the
pyridinium cross-link pyridinoline (pyd) are suggestive of extent of bone metastases.[34] such
markers have not been evaluated in patients receiving mmpi, but early studies to immunolocalise mmp
in bone metastases have been performed. lhotak et
al.[35] reported that tumour cells from breast carcinoma indeed strongly expressed  xxxg1418xxx . this is
not surprising in light of the musculoskeletal adverse effects seen with mmpi that selectively inhibit  xxxg1418xxx . more studies evaluating biological
correlates to clinical response clearly need to be done.
4. mmpi in clinical development
table ii lists mmpi that have entered clinical
trials. the chemical structures of the various compounds are illustrated in figure 1. oral  xxxd287xxx  did
not undergo further evaluation because marimastat
had better characteristics for oral administration.
however, intrapleural  xxxd287xxx  was administered
to 18 patients with malignant pleural effusions in
single doses ranging from 15 to 300 mg/m2.[36] only
8 patients did not require further thoracentesis,
comparable with the efficacy of bleomycin or tetracycline. prolonged plasma exposure persisted for
up to 12 weeks after peak concentrations of 20 to
200 mug/l were measured; patients receiving 300
mg/m2 intrapleurally maintained plasma concentrations above 25 mug/l through the 12th week. fever for 1 to 2 days after treatment was common, 8
patients had elevated liver function tests, and 5 patients had intrapleural pain.

4.1 marimastat
4.1.1. single agent use

marimastat has entered phase ii trials in several
diseases. phase i trials established the feasibility of
extended administration. however, an unusual
joint problem limited the ability to administer
marimastat for extended periods at higher doses.
at oral doses of 10mg twice daily for 3 to 5 months,
there was a 30% incidence of musculoskeletal
problems.[37] the musculoskeletal problems, which
also appear to be associated with long term administration of other hydroxamic acid based mmpi,
included joint stiffness and pain in the hands, arms
and shoulder, attributed to tendonitis. these joint
complications are dealt with by discontinuing the
drug for a period of time and reinitiating treatment
at a reduced dose. preclinical models of tendonitis
have been developed in marmosets, where  xxxd287xxx 
and marimastat do cause changes.[38] such changes
are not observed with the more selective mmpi.
although hypotheses have been raised regarding
the mechanism of this toxicity, there are no experimental data addressing the potential contributions
of inhibition of  xxxg1418xxx ,  xxxg63xxx , or other potential
targets that might alter remodelling of damage to
actively used tendons or later immunological responses to such damage. although  xxxd468xxx 
and marimastat do inhibit several sheddases, this
occurs at micromolar concentrations, much higher
than those required to inhibit the targeted enzymes.
wojtowicz-praga et al.[38] studied 12 patients with
advanced lung cancer in a standard phase i study.
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

the lowest oral dose of 25mg twice daily resulted
in plasma concentrations of between 67.4 to 394.8
mug/l. the highest dose of 100mg twice daily resulted in plasma concentrations in the range of
255.9 to 746.1 mug/l. in comparison, the in vitro ic50
for  xxxg1428xxx  is several fold lower at 1.5 to 8 mug/l.
the higher plasma concentrations in this study
were correlated with increasing musculoskeletal adverse effects.
a phase iii trial in gastric cancer involving 369
patients randomised to either placebo or marimastat was reported as showing a statistically significant benefit of marimastat compared with placebo in terms of the secondary end-point analysis
of progression-free survival.[39] this randomised
trial used marimastat 10mg twice daily. although
the primary objective of improving survival rate of
the trial did not achieve statistical significance at
the pre-defined clinical cut-off, there appears to be
a survival benefit with longer follow-up.
another trial has been completed in patients with
unresectable pancreatic cancer evaluating marimastat versus gemcitabine as first line therapy.[40] full
analysis of the data are still pending.
4.1.2 combination therapy

a phase i study of marimastat in combination
with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide was reported in patients with metastatic breast cancer.[41]
in this setting, marimastat was administered over
1 year at a dose of 10mg twice daily. concurrent
cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin were given at
standard doses every 3 weeks for a total of 6 cycles.
drugs 2000 may; 59 (5)

23 patients were enrolled with 18 of them already
discontinued. the primary reason for discontinuation was disease progression with a mean of 6
months, range 2 to 10 months. 17% of patients were
discontinued secondary to unacceptable musculoskeletal adverse effects. this trial reported more than
the expected incidence of musculoskeletal adverse
events but, overall, the toxicities experienced were
believed to be no higher than expected.
combination therapy with carboplatin was evaluated in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.[42]
in this study of 31 patients, 20 have completed 6 cycles of carboplatin [area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) 6 mg/ml × min] every 21
days in combination with escalating doses of marimastat up to 20mg twice daily. a notable adverse
effect attributed to higher doses of marimastat was
musculoskeletal pain, which necessitated the discontinuation of the drug in 9 patients. there were
8 responses, of which 3 were complete responses
as measured by computed tomography (ct) scans.
the complete responses lasted for 5, 7 and 13
months, respectively. this frequency of responses
is comparable with single agent carboplatin in advanced ovarian cancer. in a meta-analysis evaluating 3 trials with 385 patients receiving carboplatin,
a complete response rate of 23% was achieved.[43]
the time to progression was 14 months and the
median survival was 22 months. a phase iii randomised trial comparing chemotherapy with or
without marimastat is ongoing.
in pancreatic cancer, combination therapy with
gemcitabine was used in patients with unresectable
disease.[44] gemcitabine at standard doses of 1000
mg/m2 weekly for 3 out of 4 weeks was administered along with escalating doses of marimastat (up
to 20mg twice daily). the toxicities were primarily
attributed to gemcitabine, including grade 4 bilirubin elevation and grade 3 myelosuppression. two
of the 11 patients in the study had a response and 6
had stable disease.
in metastatic or locally advanced inoperable
non-small cell lung cancer, marimastat was given
in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin.[45]
the combination of the two chemotherapeutic agents

heath & grochow

with marimastat was reported to be well tolerated.
there were no unexpected toxicities from the combination, although further analysis of this trial is
underway.
other studies in advanced colon, melanoma and
prostate cancer have been performed in a phase i
setting.[46-48] a study with fluorouracil with and without  xxxd2462xxx  in combination with marimastat
(5mg or 10mg twice daily) was performed in 13
patients with advanced solid tumours. unfortunately, 5 of the 13 patients developed thrombotic
events, including a femoral artery embolus and a fatal
pulmonary embolus, although eventually these were
considered not to be related to treatment.[48]
4.2 bay-129566

the next mmpi to enter phase i clinical trials
was bay-129566, a selective inhibitor of  xxxg1428xxx ,
 xxxg1437xxx ,  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1422xxx . it is orally bioavailable with a half-life of 5 to 7 days. seymour[49]
have recently reported a summary of the 4 phase i
studies performed in patients with advanced cancers. 90 patients with sarcoma, melanoma, or
breast, ovarian or colorectal cancers received escalating doses of oral bay-129566 up to 800mg twice
daily. the toxicities were mild, reversible thrombocytopenia and anaemia, and mildly increased transaminase levels. no joint problems were observed.
dose escalation was limited by decreasing bioavailability: 8-fold dose increase produced only
doubling in auc or maximum plasma drug concentration (cmax). for example, patients receiving
bay-129566 800mg daily had an auc of 2300
mg/dl compared with those receiving 100mg daily
who had an auc of 1161 mg/dl. of 90 patients, 2
patients with refractory disease at the start of study
had stable disease for greater than 4 weeks (4 to 41
weeks).
tolcher et al.[50] have reported a trial combining
bay-129566 with paclitaxel and carboplatin in advanced cancers. the trial has 3 arms: paclitaxel alone,
paclitaxel and carboplatin, and carboplatin alone.
bay-129566 800mg twice daily was administered
1 week after chemotherapy. a total of 19 patients
were enrolled. the initial pharmacokinetic data do
drugs 2000 may; 59 (5)

metalloprotease inhibitors in cancer therapy

not show any significant alterations in bay-129566
cmax, trough or steady-state auc with the addition of
paclitaxel or paclitaxel and carboplatin. similarly,
there was no alteration in paclitaxel clearance.
however, recently, all trials utilising bay-129566
were discontinued because of concerns about the
drug’s efficacy.[51]
4.3  xxxd468xxx 

 xxxd468xxx  (mm-1270) is a nonselective
mmpi studied in the phase i setting. levitt et al.[52]
reported the results of a study of  xxxd468xxx 
150mg twice daily to 600mg three times daily involving 36 patients with advanced solid tumours,
including colon cancer, mesothelioma and melanoma. two significant toxicities were observed:
maculopapular rash and musculoskeletal symptoms. there were no tumour responses.
another trial combining  xxxd468xxx  with fluorouracil and  xxxd2147xxx  was performed in patients
with advanced colon cancer.[53] early pharmacokinetic analysis did not show any effect of this compound on fluorouracil concentrations. musculoskeletal symptoms were observed in 8 out of 20
patients, with a median time to onset of 9 weeks.
in terms of tumour responses, there were 2 patients
with partial responses and 10 patients with stable
disease. the dose of 300mg twice daily in this combination appears to be well tolerated, but final analysis is still pending.
4.4 prinomastat

prinomastat (ag-3340) is a selective mmpi of
 xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1437xxx ,  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1423xxx . it is orally
bioavailable but has a short half-life of 3 hours.
shalinsky et al.[30] have found that growth inhibition with prinomastat is correlated with maintenance of a minimum effective plasma concentration
and not necessarily the total daily dose. prinomastat administered every 6 hours at a dose of 6.25
mg/kg to nude mice with human colon tumours
(colo-320dm) resulted in a maximal growth inhibition of 74% (p < 0.05) compared with administration every 12 (12.5mg twice daily) or 24 (25mg
daily) hours, where there was no growth inhibition.

the combination of prinomastat with carboplatin
has been reported to increase survival in an orthotropic nude rat model of primary and metastatic human lung cancer.[54] at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg/
dose of prinomastat or an intraperitoneal dose of
10 or 20 mg/kg/dose of carboplatin, neither agent
improved overall survival. however, in combination,
there was prolongation of overall survival; 41.6 ±
2.5 days versus 35.7 ± 2.7 days (p < 0.03).
phase i trials of single agent prinomastat have
been completed. 47 patients receiving dosages between 5 and 100mg twice daily were studied.[55]
three patients were reported to have minimal tumour regression. 12 patients had periods of stable
disease lasting from 4 to 10 months. arthralgia and
body aches were managed with treatment breaks
and reduced dosages.
a phase i study has been reported using the combination of prinomastat with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumours.[56]
15 patients were enrolled, 7 of whom had advanced
non-small cell lung cancer. currently, toxicities appeared to be primarily from the chemotherapeutic
agents. toxicities due to prinomastat were altered
taste in 1 patient and 1 patient with grade 2 myalgia
which resolved after a dose reduction of prinomastat. further follow-up is still necessary for this study.
similarly, 15 patients with advanced prostate
cancer have been enrolled in a phase i trial with
prinomastat in combination with mitoxantrone and
prednisone.[57] prinomastat pharmacokinetics did
not appear to be altered in the presence of prednisone or mitoxantrone. the toxicities also related
to the chemotherapy agents, with the exception of
joint symptoms. however, the musculoskeletal adverse effects were comparable with those of prinomastat alone. this study is continuing its accrual
process.
4.5  xxxd3088xxx 

 xxxd3088xxx  ( xxxd3088xxx ) is a mmpi of intermediate selectivity that has recently entered phase i
trials. the ic50s of this agent range from 10 to 25
nmol/l against  xxxg1418xxx ,  xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1439xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx ; it is also potent against membrane type
drugs 2000 may; 59 (5)

1052

metalloprotease 14 (mt-1 mmp) which may be
involved in the activation of  xxxg1428xxx . like the
other selective mmpi, the ic50 of  xxxd3088xxx 
against  xxxg63xxx  is in the mumol/l range. it shows activity in metastatic models consistent with that reported for other mmpi. it will be informative to see
if  xxxd3088xxx  (which is inactive against sheddases
but highly active for  xxxg1418xxx ) produces tendonitis
or not.[58]
4.6 metastat

metastat (col-3) is an oral analogue of tetracycline which has been synthetically modified with
no antimicrobial activity. in vitro, there is inhibition of mmp expression in human colon cancer cell
lines (col0205) and in breast cancer cell lines (e10).
it is unclear whether its inhibition of primary tumour growth and metastatic lesion growth is due
to  xxxg1428xxx  down-regulation alone or a combination
of down-regulation and direct inhibition. in the
dunning mat lylu animal model, in vivo data
show a decrease in the primary tumour growth.[59]
in a phase i study in 35 patients with advanced
cancer, 4 dose levels ranging from 36 to 98 mg/m2
resulted in the dose limiting toxicity of cutaneous
photosensitivity in 69% of patients. there was no
change in the plasma vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf) levels, but the majority of patients
had a modest decline in plasma  xxxg1428xxx  levels. the
maximum tolerated dose was 70 mg/m2/day. however, down-regulation of  xxxg1428xxx  was on average
less than 30% in this study compared with in vitro
data with metastat where there was a 60 to 70%
down-regulation of  xxxg1428xxx  expression.[59]
4.7 other compounds

additional compounds with selective collagenase inhibition are being developed specifically for
osteoarthritis indications. brewster et al.[60] studied
trocade (ro-323555), an orally active collagenase
selective inhibitor in the str/ort mouse model
of arthritis. with a 10 to 50 mg/kg dose, significant
inhibition of joint space narrowing and other protective effects were seen. animal models of bone
and cartilage changes suggest that in addition to

their potential utility for prevention of osteoarthritis, mmpi may alter the natural history of bone metastasis. models of forced bone metastasis suggest
that mmpi may inhibit osteoclast mediated resorption of bone and decrease the structural changes in
bone in the presence of metastases.[61] this change
may also alter the sensitivity of diagnostic tests which
depend on active bone resorption. for example, ct
scans may not show lytic changes and bone scans
may be negative despite soft tissue and marrow involvement with metastatic lesions. further studies
with selective mmpi in patients with bone metastases will undoubtedly be important in the future.
5. conclusion
the mmpi currently in clinical trials have shown
biological effects, including musculoskeletal and
platelet changes that may reflect alteration in the balance of endogenous proteases and their natural inhibitors. prolonged time-to-progression in early trials
is suggestive of their potential therapeutic utility.
if prolongation of time-to-progression is shown
in randomised trials, and if that is associated with
improved survival, mmpi may have a role as single agents for patients with cancer. based on synergistic effects on tumour growth and survival in
animal models, mmpi are also being evaluated clinically in combination with chemotherapeutic agents
and will be studied in combination with radiation
therapy in the future.
outcome measures will have to be redefined when
assessing the utility of cytostatic drugs in early clinical trials. as new antiangiogenesis inhibitors and
other agents that may have cytostatic rather than
cytotoxic effect enter cancer therapeutics in the next
few years, patients may benefit from accepting disease stability or increased disease free survival as
measures of success, instead of focusing primarily
on eradicating tumours. in the past, partial regression induced with chemotherapy, radiation therapy
or surgery has not consistently translated into prolonged survival. the eventual role of inhibition of
mmp is likely to be in combination with other cytoreductive or cytostatic agents in disease-controlling
regimens. the optimal use of mmpi is yet to be

identified. it may be in combination therapy or in
sequence after cytotoxic agents, as well as in adjuvantive therapy. future trials will be needed to establish the proper use of these novel agents.
