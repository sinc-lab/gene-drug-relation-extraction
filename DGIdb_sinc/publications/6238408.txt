 xxxg798xxx : a specific cytosolic bidg
protein for  xxxd1781xxx 
abstrt.  xxxg798xxx , a specific cytosolic binding protein responsible for the
concentration of the immunosuppressant  xxxd1781xxx  by lymphoid cells, was
purified to homogeneity from bovine thymocytes. cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography resolved a major and minor  xxxg798xxx  species that
bind  xxxd1781xxx  with a dissociation constant of about 2 x 10-7 moles per liter and
specific activities of 77 and 67 micrograms per milligram of protein, respectively.
both  xxxg798xxx  species have an apparent molecular weight of15,000, an isoelectric
point of 9.6, and nearly identical amino acid compositions. a portion of the nh2terminal amino acid sequence of the major species was determined. the cyclosporin
a-binding activity of  xxxg798xxx  is suljhydryl dependent, unstable at 56°c and at ph
4 or 9.5, and sensitive to trypsin but not to chymotrypsin digestion.  xxxg798xxx 
specifically binds a series of cyclosporin analogs in proportion to their activity in a
mixed lymphocyte reaction. isolation of  xxxg798xxx  from the cytosol of thymocytes
suggests that the immunosuppressive activity of  xxxd1781xxx  is mediated by an
intracellular mechanism, not by a membrane-associated mechanism.
 xxxd1781xxx , a cyclic undecapeptide
of fungal origin is a potent immunosuppressant with low myelotoxicity (1). it is
used to prevent rejection of kidney and
liver transplants (2) and in graft versus
host disease (3). additional studies suggest applications for  xxxd1781xxx  in
treatment of autoimmune diseases (4),
and schistosomiasis (5).  xxxd1781xxx 
also provides a unique probe of the biochemical factors involved in regulation
of the immune and possibly other physiological responses.
 xxxd1781xxx  appears to act on the
immune system by inhibiting the initial
steps of t-lymphocyte activation. it diminishes the responsiveness of helperinducer t lymphocytes to interleukin-l
(il-1) (6, 7).  xxxd1781xxx  also inhibits
the production of interleukin-2 (il-2) by

cytolytic t lymphocytes (9, 11). however,  xxxd1781xxx  has minimal effects on
the activation and proliferation of suppressor t lymphocytes (12) or on the
response of primed t lymphocytes to
exogenous il-2 (10, 13). in addition,
 xxxd1781xxx  is reported to inhibit yinterferon production by lymphocytes
(14) and to suppress delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and inhibit production of lymphokines that affect macrophage behavior (15). however, the specific biochemical mechanism by which
 xxxd1781xxx  inhibits t-lymphocyte activation and  xxxg1173xxx  production has
not been established.

mbar a linear extrapolation (dasheine)
to a maxumum loading force of 7000 n
produced a central pressure of 2.8
mbar. this method is similar but superior to conventional methods of ultrahigh-pressure calibration because it incorporates supporting data at radial distances.
in the second method the maximum
pressure was determined from the pressure distribution by calculation of the
ratio of the pressure at a radial distance
of 30 p.m to the pressure at the center of
the flat region. an important factor associated with using the ratio in these calculations is that the flat diamond surface
did not undergo plastic deformation.
this ratio was constant for anvil set 2 at
several central pressures up to 1.8 mbar
(fig. 2b). the resulting maximum pressure in the central area of anvil set 2 was
thus determined independently of the
loading force to be 2.8 mbar when pressure at the 30-p.m radius was 1.8 mbar.
the design of anvil set 2 was found to
have exceptional properties. pressure
could be raised smoothly to above 2
mbar after alignment procedures. the
conditions were unusually stable; the
pressure in the sample region did not
vary perceptibly during the 40 day period of the experiment. unloading the
pressure slowly did not produce as favorable stress distributions as loading
the pressure, but the diamond anvils
were reclaimed after the experiment.
these results with a composite of stainless steel and ruby crystals suggest that it
should be possible to pressurize any other gasketed materials stably for study at
2 to 3 mbar with this apparatus, including solids normally in the gaseous state
at i bar such as hydrogen.

percent sucrose gradient; a single peak
of  xxxg798xxx  activity was recovered at
ph 9.5 to 9.7. ampholytes were removed by increasing the ionic strength to
l.om phosphate, followed by adsorption
onto a 1 by 30 cm phenyl sepharose cl4b column (pharmacia).  xxxg798xxx  activity was eluted with a 200-ml phosphate gradient decreasing from l.om to
0. im. final purification to homogeneity
was achieved by weak cation exchange
hplc and resolved a major and minor
species (fig. 2b) with [3h]cyclosporin
a-binding specific activities of 77 and 67
p,g per milligram of protein, respectively.
this corresponds to 0.% mol of cyclo-

sporin a bound per mole of the major
 xxxg798xxx  species. the major and minor  xxxg798xxx  species have nearly identical amino acid compositions, with single tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine
residues. the protein is especially rich in
lysine, phenylalanine, and glycine. the
major  xxxg798xxx  species yielded a single nh2-terminal sequence with a highcoupling yield (nh2-val-asn-pro-thrval-) on automated sequence analysis of
the intact protein, indicating a single
homogeneous polypeptide chain. the
unknown molecular difference between
the major and minor components appears to be a relatively minor structural
difference that does not seem to affect
 xxxd1781xxx -binding activity. the first
46 residues of a total of approximately
117 residues have been unambiguously
identified (data not given). this sequence was searched in 25-residue segments against the protein sequence database from the national biomedical research foundation (january 1984 version; 2511 protein sequences); for this

and concentration of [3h] xxxd1781xxx 
by cultures of a thymic lymphoma
(bw5147) occurs largely in the cytosol
and not the cell membrane. preliminary
characterization indicated that this unfractionated binding component was of
low molecular weight and displayed isoelectric points of 6.8 and 8.6 (16). we
now report the purification to homogeneity and the properties of a comparable
cytosolic  xxxg798xxx   xxxg1809xxx ,
which we term " xxxg798xxx ."
to quantitate  xxxg798xxx  activity during purification, we developed a sephadex lh-20 column assay that measures
the capacity of crude or purified binding
protein to cause a proportional amount
of [3h] xxxd1781xxx  to elute in the protein-containing void volume of this
weakly hydrophobic matrix (fig. 1); elution of free [3h] xxxd1781xxx  is significantly retarded in lh-20 columns.
[3h] xxxd1781xxx  binding was linear for
a more than 90-fold concentration range
of  xxxg798xxx  (fig. 1) and was not affected by the presence of 7.5 percent serum
required to minimize nonspecific adsorption of  xxxd1781xxx  to surfaces.
for preparative isolation of  xxxg798xxx , 200 to 500 g of calf thymus glands
were homogenized for 45 seconds (1:4
weight to volume) in 10 mm  xxxd3449xxx 
(ph 7.2) containing 0.15m kcl and 1
mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; 2mercaptoethanol was added to a final
concentration of 5 mm, and the mixture
was homogenized for an additional 45
seconds. after centrifugation at 8000g
for 20 minutes at 4°c, the supernatant
was clarified by filtration through a 0.2fm acroflux capsule (gelman) at 4°c.
as the filtrate was collected, the volume
of the retentate was maintained by slow
addition of 2 liters of  xxxd3449xxx  (10 mm,
ph 7.2) containing 5 mm 2- xxxd26xxx  and 0.02 percent sodium azide.
essentially all of the [3h]cyclosporin abinding activity in the cytosol was associated with a low molecular weight component as determined by size-exclusion
high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) (fig. 2a). the clarified cytosol (4 liters) was filtered through a 5square-foot 100-kd sulfone exclusion
membrane (pithkooooi) in a pellicon
cassette system (millipore) by recirculation with addition of 4 liters of  xxxd3449xxx 
and then concentrated to 60 ml in the
same apparatus with a 5-square-foot 10kd exclusion membrane (ptg6-0005).
all fractionation steps were performed at
4°c and all solutions, including dialysis
media, contained 5 mm 2- xxxd26xxx  and 0.02 percent sodium azide.

intraneuronal  xxxg2240xxx  contributes to the
severity of experimental arthritis
abstract. there is evidence that  xxxg2240xxx  is a peptide neurotransmitter of some
unmyelinated primary afferent nociceptors and that its release from the peripheral
terminals of primary afferent fibers mediates neurogenic inflammation. the investigators examined whether  xxxg2240xxx  also contributes to the severity of adjuvantinduced arthritis, an inflammatory disease in rats. they found that, in the rat, joints
that -developed more severe arthritis (ankles) were more densely innervated by
 xxxg2240xxx -containing primary afferent neurons than were joints that developed
less severe arthritis (knees). infusion of  xxxg2240xxx  into the knee increased the
severity of arthritis; injection of a  xxxg2240xxx  receptor antagonist did not. these
results suggest a significant physiological difference between joints that develop mild
and severe arthritis and indicate that release of intraneuronal  xxxg2240xxx  in joints
contributes to the severity of the arthritis.
recent studies have implicated the peripheral nervous system in the inflammation seen in arthritis. for example, in
rats with experimental arthritis, the concentration of the undecapeptide  xxxg2240xxx  (sp) increases in peripheral
nerves that have branches innervating
inflamed joints (1). furthermore, if capsaicin, a neurotoxin that is relatively
selective for unmyelinated sensory neurons (2), is administered to rats before or
after the onset of arthritis, paw swelling
and tenderness is diminished (3)x the
hypothesis that the nervous system contributes to arthritis is supported by studies demonstrating that the inflammation
and tissue destruction seen clinically in
rheumatoid arthritis and experimentally
in adjuvant- or collagen-induced arthritis
more frequently and more severely involve the more densely innervated, distal joints of an extremity (4). we report
here further evidence that the nervous
system contributes to arthritic inflammation, and, more specifically, that the
severity of arthritis can be attributed, at
least in part, to actions of sp in the
affected joint.

our initial experiments established
that the joints most severely affected are
indeed the most densely innervated and
have the highest sp concentration. it is
difficult to directly measure the innervation density of joints. we therefore used
two indirect measures, the nociceptive
threshold of the joint capsule, which
should be inversely correlated with innervation density (5), and the magnitude
of the spinal projection of the afferent
fibers.
vocalization in response to a noxious
stimulus was measured in rats lightly
anesthetized with pentobarbital. a pair
of stimulating electrodes, separated by 1
mm, were placed against the surgically
exposed joint capsule. increasingly intense 1-second trains of monopolar
pulses (100 ,usec; 8 hz) were delivered to
evoke vocalization (6).
nociceptive thresholds of the left and
right ankle joints of normal rats were
similar, as were the thresholds of left and
right knee joints (fig. 1). the threshold
of a given ankle or knee joint was also
constant throughout the experiment, and
thresholds at different points on the same

injection of 4 percent wga-hrp revealed that the ankle has a significant
afferent projection to the dorsal horn of
the spinal cord. no projection from the
knee joint capsule could be found. since
it could be argued that hrp is more
dilute in the knee than in the ankle
because of the larger joint space and that
this may contribute to differential uptake
of hrp by knee and ankle joint afferent
fibers, a series of animals was studied in
which increasingly higher concentrations
of wga-hrp were injected into the
knee. five rats were injected in opposite
ankle and knee joints in dose ratios as
high as 20:1 (25 ,ul of 4 percent solution
in the knee and 5 ri of 18 percent solution in the ankle). even at the highest
dose of wga-hrp, only minimal reaction product was recorded in the dorsal
horn ipsilateral to the knee injection. in
all rats, however, a concentrated area of
reaction product was seen in sections of
the fourth lumbar segment of the spinal
cord ipsilateral to the injected ankle. the
densest afferent projection was in a
wedge shape that covered lamina i and
the substantia gelatinosa (fig. 1). since
many small nociceptive primary afferents terminate in the superficial dorsal
horn, it appears that the ankle receives a
major nociceptive innervation.
to assess whether sp is found in joint
capsules and whether it -is derived from
joint innervation, we collected joint capsules (including both fibrous capsule and
synovial membrane) from normal rats
and from rats whose sciatic and femoral
nerves had been bilaterally transected 6
days earlier.  xxxg2240xxx  was measured
by radioimmunoassay (8). immunoreactivity in tissue extract had a retention
time identical to that of synthetic sp
when separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and measured by
