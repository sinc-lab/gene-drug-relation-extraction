pharmacological characteristics of the inhibition of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents at human adult muscle nicotinic acetylcholine re...  nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (nmbas) are classic competitive-inhibitors at the muscle  xxxg456xxx  (nachr). although the fetal subtype muscle nachr has been extensively studied at a molecular level, less is known about the interaction between nondepolarizing nmbas and the human adult muscle nachr. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of clinically used nondepolarizing nmbas at human adult muscle nachrs and the mechanisms behind the inhibition.
