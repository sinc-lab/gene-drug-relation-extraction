abstract
recently,  xxxd3522xxx  has become increasingly of interest in the bone metabolism ®eld because of its role as a cofactor in the carboxylation of osteocalcin.
although the role of osteocalcin is not clear, noncarboxylated osteocalcin is
one risk factor in hip fractures. it has been reported that the circulating levels
of  xxxd2941xxx  in osteoporotic patients were signi®cantly lower than those of
age-matched control subjects. in this study, we measured circulating levels of
 xxxd2941xxx , menaquinone-4 (mk-4) and menaquinone-7 (mk-7) in 23 normal
healthy women aged 52±93 years (mean  sd: 80.1  3.5), 13 female patients
with vertebral fractures aged 66±93 years (80.3  7.8) and 38 female patients
with hip fractures aged 76±87 years (79.8  9.2), (all japanese), in order to
make sure whether these  xxxd3522xxx  levels were different in these three groups.
serum circulating levels of mk-4 was undetectable in most subjects (only one
out of 74). appreciable numbers from these three groups had undetectable
levels of mk-7 (52% of the control group, 23% of the vertebral fracture group
and 24% of the hip fracture group). eight subjects from the normal control
group (35%) and ®ve patients from the vertebral group (38%) had undetectable levels of  xxxd2941xxx . we did not ®nd a signi®cant difference in the
measurable levels of  xxxd2941xxx , mk-4 and mk-7 in patients with vertebral

introduction
recently,  xxxd3522xxx  has become increasingly of interest in the bone
metabolism ®eld because of its role as a cofactor in the carboxylation of
osteocalcin (1). osteocalcin is a unique noncollagenous protein of the extracellular
matrix of bone that is synthesized by the osteoblasts. osteocalcin has three
residues of  xxxd1246xxx  (gla), an amino acid resulting from the vitamin
k-dependent modi®cation of  xxxd2431xxx  residues within the molecule. although
the role of osteocalcin is not clear, noncarboxylated osteocalcin is one of the risk
factors in hip fractures (2) and it was found that the restoration of fullycarboxylated circulating osteocalcin during  xxxd3522xxx  treatment in the elderly
was accompanied by a decrease in urinary calcium and hydroxyproline in some of
these women (3).
there are two main sources of  xxxd3522xxx  in humans:  xxxd2941xxx  which is
provided by food and vitamin k2 which is a family of compounds with the same
naphthoquinone moiety and an unsaturated side chain that can vary from 1 to 13
repeated isoprene units (4). vitamin k2 is synthesized by bacteria of the
micro¯ora in the gut. it has been reported that the circulating levels of vitamin
k1 in osteoporotic patients were signi®cantly lower than those of age-matched
control subjects (5,6). hodges et al. showed a signi®cant decrease in  xxxd2941xxx 
and menaquinone-7 (mk-7) and menaquinone-8 (mk-8) in patients with hip
fracture compared to age-matched controls (7). kaneki et al. reported that the
possibility that de®ciency of  xxxd3522xxx , particularly that of mk-7, is possibly one
risk factor in developing osteoporosis (8). in this study, we measured circulating
levels of  xxxd2941xxx , mk-4 and mk-7 in healthy japanese women, patients with
vertebral fractures and patients with hip fractures in order to make sure whether
 xxxd3522xxx  levels were different in these three groups.
materials and methods
subjects
healthy women
the healthy normal control group consisted of 23 adult females aged 52±93
years (mean sd: 80.1  3.5). all subjects had no previous disease known to
affect bone metabolism (such as hyperthyroidism, renal disease, collagen disease
or ovarian tumour) and had not previously used estrogens or any other hormonal
medications. all were volunteers and gave their informed consent prior to the
study.

osteoporosis group
the vertebral fracture group consisted of 13 patients aged 66±93 years
(mean sd: 80.3  7.8) with vertebral fractures (but with no fractures sustained
within the previous 6 months) as diagnosed by x-ray ®lms of the thoracic and
lumbar spine. these fractures resulted in more than a 20% reduction in anterior,
middle, and/or posterior height (9). the hip fracture group consisted of 38 patients
with hip fractures aged 76±87 years (mean  sd: 79.8 9.2). none of the patients
in either group had been receiving any medications that might have affected
calcium metabolism during the study. secondary osteoporosis patients were
excluded from the study.
blood samples and urine samples were collected from hip fracture patients
immediately after they were taken to an emergency room at a hospital. it was
shown that levels of  xxxd3522xxx  were not affected by fractures during the ®rst 48
hours after fracture (10).

methods
serum osteocalcin was measured by an ria with a yamasa osteocalcin kit
with the use of polyclonal antibodies. intra- and inter-assay cvs were <15%.
pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline in urine were measured by hplc after
hydrolysis according to an automated analysis described by pratt et al. (11).
before hydrolysis, urinary creatinine content was measured. the values of urinary
pyr and dpyr were expressed per mol of urinary creatinine. the intra- and interassay cvs were less than 10%.  xxxd2941xxx , menaquinone-4 (mk4), and
menaquinone-7 (mk7) were measured by hplc. the method is based on a
hydrogen gas-saturated mobile phase with ¯uorescence after post-column reduction by a platinum oxide catalyst column (12). the detection limits were 0.1 ng/ml
for  xxxd2941xxx  and mk-4, and 0.4 ng/ml for mk-7. the cvs were less than 5%.
the samples that were found to have very low levels of the  xxxd3522xxx  forms,
which were below the limit of detection, were assigned a nominal value of 50% of
the lowest detectable authentic standard materials. data were analyzed using a
statview ii program (abacus concepts, inc., berkeley, ca) on a macintosh
computer. comparisons of values of biochemical markers and vitamins in three
groups were performed using one way analysis of variance (anova) followed by
the scheffe f-test method. p values <0.05 were considered to be signi®cant.

results
serum alkaline phosphatase and  xxxg124xxx  were signi®cantly
decreased in patients with hip fractures compared to normal controls and patients
with vertebral fractures. there were no differences in serum calcium, serum

fractures (table i). however, osteocalcin tended to be lower in the hip fracture
group, and urinary pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline tended to be higher in the
vertebral fracture group and the hip fracture group. when the undetectable levels
of the  xxxd3522xxx  forms were assigned a nominal value of 50% of the lowest
detectable levels, there was no signi®cant difference in the mean levels of vitamin
k1, mk-7 and mk-8 between the fracture and control groups (table ii). a large
number of them were at undetectable levels, especially mk-4. in all subjects, 12
had undetectable levels of  xxxd2941xxx  (15.8%), 75 had undetectable levels of mk4 (98.7%) and 26 had undetectable levels of mk-7(34.2%) (fig. 1). the mean

discussion
it has been reported that osteoporotic patients had low levels of circulating
 xxxd3522xxx  (4±8). however, we did not ®nd a signi®cant decrease in  xxxd2941xxx ,
mk-4 and mk-7 in patients with vertebral fractures or patients with hip fractures
compared to age-matched normal controls. obviously, the reason is that most of
the  xxxd2941xxx , mk-4 and mk-7 values were below detectable levels in the
present study. it has been reported that a percentage of undetectable levels of
 xxxd2941xxx  and mk-7 were less than 5% and 15%, respectively both in european
caucasians and in japanese (7,8). in the present study, eight subjects from the
normal control group (35%) and ®ve patients from the vertebral group (38%) had
undetectable levels of  xxxd2941xxx . appreciable numbers from the three groups had
undetectable levels of mk-7 (52% of the control group, 23% of the vertebral
fracture group and 24% of the hip fracture group). although the rate of

undetectable levels of mk-7 is greater in this study than in the study done on
european caucasians, the mean concentration of mk-7 in the present study was
about ®ve times as much as those of mk-7 in the european caucasians (7,13). the
reason is not clear. however one possibility is that the japanese take much vitamin
k2 from food, such as fermented soybeans (natto). it has been demonstrated that
dietary mk-7 can prevent bone loss in ovariectomized rats, and that the prolonged
administration of natto diets containing mk-7 has a role on the prevention of
ovariectomy-induced bone loss (14). circulating levels of mk-4 were undetectable
in most subjects (only one was detectable in all subjects) in this study. this result is
in accordance with the results of kaneki et al., reporting that 93% of 60 japanese
subjects were below the detectable limit (0.1 ng/ml) of circulating levels of mk-4.
there has been no report about circulating levels of mk-4 in any other studies
except the study on japanese.
kaneki et al. (8) reported that serum concentrations of mk-7 in the japanese
was signi®cantly lower in women with vertebral fractures than in those without
vertebral fractures (3.29  3.63 ng/ml vs. 6.26 5.62, mean  sd, respectively).
the mean values of normal controls and osteoporotic patients in their study are
higher than those in our study, which were calculated only from detectable
samples. as well as serum concentration of mk-7, serum concentration of vitamin
k1 has been reported to show large standard deviations in each study and there
were differences in mean values among the reported studies (4±8). taken together,
these data suggest that race or dietary habit and other factors may affect circulating
levels of  xxxd3522xxx . however, more investigation is necessary to know why there
are differences in circulating levels of  xxxd3522xxx  in each study. furthermore, it is
necessary to develop a method for measuring vitamin ks more precisely and
sensitively. it is also necessary to measure other vitamin ks besides k1, mk-4 and
mk-7 in order to investigate which  xxxd3522xxx  is the best risk factor in developing
osteoporosis.
