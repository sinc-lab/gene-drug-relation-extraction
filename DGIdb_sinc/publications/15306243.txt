abstract
 xxxd1868xxx  (diaz), an opener of mitochondrial atp-sensitive k+ channels (mkatp), protects neurons against hypoxic/ischemic stress in
vivo, however, direct evidence showing mitochondrial effects of diaz in postischemic neurons is lacking. we investigated if diaz affects
mitochondrial alterations after global ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) in  xxxg287xxx  pyramidal neurons by using oxalate-pyroantimonate electron
cytochemistry. anesthetized piglets were either non-treated, or treated with diaz (3 mg/kg, iv), i/r, diaz + i/r, or 5-hydroxy- xxxd1821xxx 
(5hd) + diaz + i/r (n = 6, 6, 11, 5, 7, respectively). ischemia (10 min) was induced by intracranial pressure (icp) elevation. after 5 – 30 min
of reperfusion, the brains were fixed for ultrastructural studies. relative volumes of ca2 +-containing deposits and mitochondria in  xxxg287xxx 
pyramidal cells were determined by point counting on electron micrographs. i/r resulted in maximal increases in mitochondrial volume
(from 7.14 f 0.63% to 9.74 f 0.57%*), and ca2 + levels (from 5.86 f 1.11% to 11.39 f 1.35%*; mean f s.e.m., *p < 0.05)  xxxd1891xxx  – 15-min
reperfusion time. in this interval, pretreatment with diaz virtually abolished mitochondrial swelling (6.88 f 0.49%) and ca2 + accumulation
(5.15 f 0.82%) evoked by i/r. the protective effect of diaz was reduced by 5hd, an inhibitor of mkatp, resulting in a calcium
accumulation similar to that after ir (10.44 f 1.98%). thus, diaz might preserve mitochondrial integrity in  xxxg287xxx  pyramidal cells after i/r,
at least in part mediated by mkatp.

1. introduction
global cerebral ischemia and/or asphyxia may result in
permanent neurological damage in the newborn, and are
common causes of mortality in the perinatal period [4]. loss
of cellular calcium ion (ca2 +) homeostasis is widely accepted as the hallmark of neuronal damage induced by
ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) in both adults and neonates [9].
metabolic failure results in anoxic depolarization that induces a subsequent ca2 + inflow from the extracellular space
[38]. mitochondrial ca2 + accumulation during i/r may be

one of the most important links between elevated intracellular ca2 + levels and neuronal injury [17]. in addition to
being the major site of atp production and an important
compartment of numerous metabolic processes, the mitochondria may also be viewed as ‘‘ca2 + buffers’’: respiring
polarized mitochondria rapidly accumulate ca2 + from the
cytosol [20,41]. however, excessive mitochondrial ca2 +
accumulation increases reactive oxygen species (ros) generation [15,27] which may damage the function of the
electron transport chain, resulting in decreased atp production. mitochondrial ca2 + overload may also lead to the
opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in
its high conductance state and the release of apoptosisinducing factors, such as  xxxg569xxx  [7], inducing cell
destruction. despite its significance, very few studies have

98

f. domoki et al. / brain research 1019 (2004) 97–104

demonstrated a rise in mitochondrial ca2 + levels after
ischemia in vivo [14,43], and we are not aware of any such
studies in newborn piglets.
although mitochondrial damage appears to be central in
the development of ischemic cell death, very few neuroprotective strategies selectively target mitochondria [18].
 xxxd1868xxx  (diaz) is a selective activator of mitochondrial
atp-dependent potassium channels (mkatps) [1,23] that
can be found in the inner mitochondrial membrane in
various cells, including neurons [1,24]. diaz has been
shown to have neuroprotective properties in both global
and focal models of hypoxic-ischemic (h/i) injuries in
adults [19,26,29,34,35] and neonates [12,33] as well, but
by unknown mechanisms. the in vivo effect of diaz has
been assumed to be mediated by mkatps, based chiefly on
the efficacy of 5-hydroxydecanoate (5hd), a selective
mkatp blocker [1,23] in antagonizing the neuroprotective
effect of diaz [12,26,33 – 35]. however, no data are
available on the direct effect of diaz on neuronal mitochondria in vivo.
in this study, we employed oxalate-pyroantimonate electron cytochemistry combined with quantitative morphometry to describe changes in the mitochondrial structure and
total intracellular ca2 + levels following i/r in the hippocampal  xxxg287xxx  pyramidal neurons of newborn pigs. these
neurons were chosen because of their homogeneity and
vulnerability to i/r. our major purpose was to test if diaz
affects postischemic mitochondrial swelling and ca2 + accumulation.

2. materials and methods
2.1. surgery
newborn piglets of either sex (1 – 2 days old, body
weight 1 –2 kg) were used. all experiments were approved
by the local ethical committee and were performed in
accordance with institutional guidelines for animal experiments and with governmental laws for animal protection.
the animals were anesthetized with sodium thiopental (30 –
40 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally) followed by the intravenous (iv) injection of a-chloralose (75 mg/kg). supplemental doses of a-chloralose were given to maintain a stable
level of anesthesia. the right femoral artery and vein were
catheterized to record blood pressure and to administer
drugs and fluids, respectively. the piglets were intubated
via tracheotomy and artificially ventilated with room air.
the ventilation rate ( f20/min) and tidal volume ( f20 ml)
were adjusted to maintain the arterial blood gas values and
ph in the physiological range. body temperature was
maintained at 37 – 38j c by a water-circulating heating
pad. arterial ph (7.40 f 0.01) and blood gases ( pco2:
33.8 f 0.6 mm hg; po2: 70 f 5 mm hg) were in the normal
ranges, and did not vary significantly between the different
groups.

the head of the piglet was fixed in a stereotactic frame.
the scalp was incised and removed together with the
connective tissue over the calvaria. a circular (19 mm in
diameter) craniotomy was made in the left parietal bone.
the dura was cut and reflected over the skull. a stainless
steel cranial window with three needle ports was placed into
the craniotomy, sealed with bone wax and cemented with
cyanoacrylate ester (super glue, japan) and dental acrylic.
the closed window was filled with artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (acsf) warmed to 37j c and equilibrated with 6% o2
and 6.5% co2 in balance n2 to give ph = 7.33, pco2 = 46
mm hg, and po2 = 43 mm hg. the acsf consisted of
(mmol/l): nacl 132, kcl 2.9, cacl2 1.2, mgcl2 1.4,
nahco3 24.6, urea 6.7 and glucose 3.7. the pial circulation
was visualized using an operating microscope (wild, switzerland) equipped with a ccd camera (a. krüss, germany)
connected to a tv monitor (panasonic, japan).
2.2. global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (i/r)
to induce global cerebral ischemia, a 3-mm hole was
made with an electric drill with a toothless bit, and the dura
was exposed. a hollow brass bolt was inserted into the left
frontal cranium rostral to the cranial window and secured in
place with cyanoacrylate ester and dental acrylic. cerebral
ischemia was produced by infusion of acsf to raise
intracranial pressure (icp) above the arterial pressure.
ischemia was verified by the cessation of blood flow in
the observed vessels through the cranial window. previously, we have shown, by using microspheres, that the cerebral
blood flow (cbf) is virtually zero during the ischemic
period in all examined brain areas including the hippocampus, the spinal cord, even the retina [3,10,25]. as necessary,
venous blood was withdrawn to maintain the mean arterial
blood pressure (mabp) near normal values. at the end of
the ischemic period, the infusion tube was clamped and the
icp returned to the preischemic levels. the withdrawn and
heparinized blood was reinfused intravenously.
2.3. experimental groups
the piglets in group 1 served as non-treated controls
(n = 6). the piglets in group 2 received diaz (n = 6, 3 mg/
kg, iv, sigma, st. louis, mo) to study the potential effects
of diaz on mitochondrial structure and ca2 + content
during normoxic conditions.
the other groups underwent i/r. to optimize experimental settings, we carried out a pilot study to find that time
point of reperfusion, where i/r induced mitochondrial
alterations appeared to be the largest. therefore, instrumented animals underwent 10 min of global cerebral ischemia (described below), that was followed by 5, 8, 10, 15, or
30 min of reperfusion (n = 1, 2, 2, 3, and 3, respectively).
based on the findings of that study (shown in the results),
animals with 10– 15 min of reperfusion were selected (n = 5)
to form group 3, and this time point was used in the other i/

f. domoki et al. / brain research 1019 (2004) 97–104

r groups. in group 4 (n = 5), the piglets were given diaz
15 min prior to the i/r. in group 5 (n = 7), the animals
received 5-hydroxydecanoate (5hd, 20 mg/kg iv, sigma) an
inhibitor of mkatp, 15 min before diaz + i/r. the anesthetized animals were killed at the end of the experiments by
perfusing the brain through the carotid arteries with the
fixative.
2.4. sample preparation for electron microscopic histochemistry
for simultaneous preservation of the ultrastructure of
the tissue and the distribution/content of ca2 +, a special
fixative was used for perfusion fixation, which contained
3% glutaraldehyde and 90 mmol/l  xxxd2802xxx , adjusted to
ph 7.4 with koh [5,6]. the brains of the piglets were
perfused through the common carotid arteries with 400 ml
of ice-cold fixative, the brains were then removed, and the
hippocampi were dissected, immersed into the same fixative and postfixed at 4 jc overnight. approximately 1mm-thick transverse slices were cut from the hippocampi,
which were cropped to their  xxxg287xxx  regions under the
dissecting microscope (leica mz-6) before further processing. these tissue blocks were rinsed for 15 min in
7.5% sucrose containing 90 mmol/l k-oxalate and fixed
for an additional 2 h at 4 jc in solution containing 2% kpyroantimonate and 1% osmic acid (ph adjusted to 7.4
with acetic acid). specimens were then rinsed in distilled
water (ph adjusted to 10 with koh) for 10 min, dehydrated in graded series of ethanol, processed through
propylene oxide and embedded into durcupan acm.
blocks were polymerized for 2 days at 56 jc.
semithin sections were cut from the blocks on a leica
ultracut uct ultramicrotome, stained and screened under
the light microscope (olympus vanox-t-ah-2). after trimming the blocks to the  xxxg287xxx  pyramidal cell layer, 50-nm
ultrathin sections were obtained, contrasted with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate and analyzed in a zeiss cem 902
transmission electron microscope (em). the applied oxalate-pyroantimonate procedure for the demonstration of
ca2 + at the subcellular level provides good ultrastructural
preservation and results in electron-dense deposits (edds)
due to the precipitation of tissue ca2 + by the fixative.
although the specificity of the histochemical reaction for
ca2 + was not checked during this study, this was examined
extensively in our earlier experiments and validated either
with energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis [13], or electron
spectroscopic imaging [16,36,37].
2.5. morphometric analysis of  xxxg287xxx  pyramidal cells
ultrathin sections prepared from the hippocampi were
screened in the em using a low instrumental magnification
(3000 – 7000  ). perikaryal regions of pyramidal cells,
selected randomly, were photographed at a magnification
of 12 000  , until 12 – 15 fields from different cells (one

99

from each) had been collected from each animal. the
micrographs were further enlarged by 2.7  . in groups
1 –5, the number of cells examined were 71, 76, 62, 67, and
61, respectively.
the analysis of the karyoplasm included: (1) the
relative volume of mitochondria as a percentage of the
cytoplasmic volume; (2) the volume ratio of edds
within mitochondria in relation to the mitochondrial
volume; (3) the volume ratio of edds in the cytoplasm,
using the cytoplasmic volume as the reference space. the
volume-to-volume ratio (volume fraction) of edds or
mitochondria was determined with respect to a selected
reference compartment such as mitochondrial or cytoplasmic volume, and were assessed on electron microscopic
prints with a point counting procedure, for a review find
[28] the scores counted on individual micrographs ( pmit,
pca(mit), pcyt, pca(cyt)) were pooled according to animals,
and the corresponding ratio values (apca(mit)/apmit,
apca(cyt)/apcyt, apmit/apcyt + apmit) were then determined for the animals in each group. the technique is
based on the delesse principle [11], which says that the
profile-area of an object of interest per unit area on the
two-dimensional section is a good predictor of the
volume of the same object per unit volume in the
three-dimensional space. the principle was developed
further by thompson [39], who showed that this predictor, the volume fraction of the object of interest, can be
estimated by randomly positioning a tessellation of grid
points on the sections and dividing the number of points
hitting the profile-area of interest by the number of
points hitting the reference area.
2.6. statistics
data are expressed as mean f s.e.m. to test differences
between the experimental groups, one-way anova was
used, followed by pairwise comparisons using the student –
newman –keuls test where appropriate. the p values of
< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

3. results
in our pilot study, we searched for the optimal time point
in the 5– 30-min reperfusion interval to study the effect of
10-min global ischemia on mitochondrial volume and intracellular ca2 + levels. we found that global cerebral ischemia
elicited biggest acute mitochondrial alterations after 10 – 15
min of reperfusion (fig. 1), and thus these animals were
combined as group 3 for further comparisons.
the mabp was in the physiological range and did not
vary significantly between the experimental groups. diaz
treatment (n = 11) elicited only a non-significant drop in
mabp from 73 f 5 to 63 f 5 mm hg, 10 min after the
administration of diaz. in group 5, 5hd did not alter
mabp significantly.

fig. 1. the effect of 10-min global ischemia followed by 5 – 30-min reperfusion on mitochondrial volume and intracellular ca2 + levels of  xxxg287xxx  pyramidal cells.
data are obtained from 12, 23, 24, 38 and 40 neurons for 5, 8, 10, 15, and 30-min reperfusion period (n = 1, 2, 2, 3, and 3 piglets), respectively. there was a
gradual increase both in mitochondrial volume ratio (gray bars) and ca2 + levels (black bars) from 5 to 15 min of reperfusion, whereas at 30 min, the values
seemed to return towards baseline levels. however, cytoplasmic ca2 + levels (white bars) increased only to a lesser extent, and no clear-cut time course pattern
could be observed.

in the animals not subjected to i/r, the  xxxg287xxx  region of the
hippocampus appeared intact when evaluated by light microscopy, and the em analysis of the  xxxg287xxx  pyramidal cells
also revealed no ultrastructural signs of damage (fig. 2a –
b). as compared with the non-treated controls (group 1),
diaz treatment (group 2) had no effect on either the
ultrastructure of the pyramidal cells or the distribution of
the edds (fig. 2).
however, i/r (group 3) elicited no obvious morphological alterations at the light microscopic level, but ultrastructural alterations could be observed in the pyramidal cell
bodies. mitochondrial swelling, hypodensity, and disruption
of the cristae were prominent (fig. 2c). i/r also resulted in
increased intracellular ca2 + levels (fig. 3). mitochondrial,
but not cytoplasmic ca2 + levels were increased significantly
as compared with the normoxic controls. diaz per se did
not affect the mitochondrial volume or the ca2 + levels
(group 2), but essentially prevented the development of i/
r-elicited ultrastructural alterations (fig. 2d), mitochondrial
swelling and ca2 + accumulation (fig. 3). combined treatment with 5hd + diaz (group 5) appeared to still reduce
mitochondrial swelling, but not mitochondrial ca2 + accumulation after i/r (fig. 3).

4. discussion
the major finding of the present study is that diaz
prevents postischemic mitochondrial swelling and ca2 +
accumulation in the  xxxg287xxx  pyramidal cells of piglets. this
finding is in accordance with several studies demonstrating
the neuroprotective effect of diaz. diaz (2.5 –5 mg/kg)
was equally effective in improving the neuronal function,
reducing infarct size or preventing apoptosis in neonates and
adults, in global or focal ischemia models, in several
species, including rats [19,33,35], mice [26], dogs [34]
and piglets [12]. the exact mechanism of these various
protective effects of diaz, however, is unclear. although
diaz is considered to be a rather selective opener of
mkatps ex vivo, it may have other targets such as mitochondrial complex ii of the respiratory chain [22] or the
plasma membrane katp. virtually all studies have suggested
the involvement of mkatp in diaz-induced neuroprotection, based on the antagonism exerted by 5hd, a mkatp
inhibitor [12,19,26,33 – 35]. the study first yields direct
evidence that a neuroprotective dose of diaz (3 mg/kg)
does affect the mitochondria in neurons subjected to i/r in
vivo. since the combination of treatments (diaz + 5hd + i/

treatment (a),  xxxd1868xxx  (diaz) treatment (b), 10 min of global cerebral ischemia followed by 15 min of reperfusion (i/r) (c), and diaz treatment followed
by i/r (d). panels a – b show the normal ultrastructural organization: intact nuclear membrane (nu), the rough endoplasmic reticulum (er) lamellae are
parallel, and not swollen, and the mitochondria (m) are dense, with occasional electrondens ca2 +-containing deposits (arrowheads). thus, under normoxic
conditions, diaz has no effect on the ultrastructure and ca2 + homeostasis of  xxxg287xxx  pyramidal cells. ultrastructural signs of ischemia can be observed in panel
c: swelling and hypodensity are obvious in the mitochondria, accompanied by large clusters of ca2 + deposits (*). the endoplasmic reticulum is also swollen.
in contrast, pretreatment with diaz greatly diminished the effect of i/r on cellular ultrastructure (panel d). the mitochondrial cristae are preserved, no
noteworthy swelling can be observed, and large intramitochondrial ca2 + deposits are absent.

r) generated highly increased variance of the results, due to
the effect of accumulated standard deviations of the individual treatments, and lacking the possibility to perform the
required considerably higher number of repeated experiments in the diaz + 5hd + i/r group to attain statistical
significance, the antagonizing effect of 5hd was estimated
qualitatively only. thus, the present study also suggests the
involvement of mkatp activation in the mitochondrial effect
of diaz, because 5hd shows a tendency to decrease the
effect of diaz on reduction of postischemic ca2 + levels.
the present study utilized oxalate-pyroantimonate electron cytochemistry to visualize the intracellular ca2 +, in
combination with quantitative morphometry. the technique
can determine the distribution of intracellular ca2 + at high
spatial resolution in the em, but is incapable of recording
fast dynamic changes. to the best of our knowledge, the
present study was the first to analyze the effect of h/i stress
on the cellular ca2 + homeostasis in a gyrencephalic species.
in addition, the few available studies on rodents did not

quantitatively assess the distribution of the edds, making
the comparison with our results rather difficult [14,32].
nevertheless, in adult gerbils, short periods of global i/r
also induced mitochondrial ca2 + accumulation in the  xxxg287xxx 
pyramidal cells. in that study, ‘‘mitochondrial ca2 + uptake
index’’ determined by subjective grading, displayed a maximal increase at 15 min of reperfusion, and it had returned to
baseline levels by 30 min after ischemia [14]. interestingly,
we found a virtually identical time course of postischemic
mitochondrial ca2 + movements in the newborn pig in the
present study. the essentially twofold increase observed in
the total mitochondrial ca2 + levels after i/r may appear
relatively small. however, considering that total ca2 + levels
exceed free intracellular ca2 + concentrations by at least
several thousand times [30], our observations are in accordance with in vitro measurements using ca2 +-fluorescent
techniques.
our morphometric analysis also yielded data on the
relative mitochondrial volume compared to that of the cell

fig. 3. effect of  xxxd1868xxx  (diaz) pretreatment on mitochondrial volume and intracellular ca2 + levels after 10-min global cerebral ischemia followed by 10 –
15-min reperfusion (i/r). in the absence of i/r, diaz (gray bar, n = 6) did not change either mitochondrial volume or intracellular ca2 + levels compared to
non-treated controls (white bar, n = 6). i/r alone (striped white bar, n = 5) significantly increased the mitochondrial volume by f35% and nearly doubled
mitochondrial ca2 + levels. diaz given before i/r (striped gray bar, n = 5) essentially reversed the mitochondrial changes to control levels. 5hydroxydecanoate (5hd, hatched gray bar, n = 7) given prior to diaz did not seem to block the effect of diaz on postischemic reduction of mitochondrial
volume. however, postischemic mitochondrial ca2 + levels appeared to elevate after 5hd + diaz similarly to non-treated i/r animals. all groups that
underwent i/r showed a trend for increased cytoplasmic ca2 + levels compared to normoxic controls, but the changes failed to reach the level of significance in
all cases. *p < 0.05, significantly higher than all other experimental groups except 5hd + diaz + i/r group (axis break). mitochondrial ca2 + data of

body (excluding the nuclear volume), which had not been
examined previously. although the values might be affected by changes in cell volume, light and em observation of
the pyramidal cells after i/r revealed no sign of gross cell
swelling, or cell shrinking as compared with the controls.
the present study demonstrated that neuronal mitochondrial volume increased significantly (f 35%) in the early
reperfusion period (10 – 15 min) after ischemia, which
coincided with the peak of ca2 + accumulation. this early
mitochondrial swelling may play an important role in the
neuronal damage elicited by i/r, since increased mitochondrial matrix volume is known to stimulate the activity
of the electron transport chain, and the mitochondrial
release of ros [31] and/or proapoptotic factors [21,42].
diaz could reduce mitochondrial swelling, but 5hd
unaltered this effect of diaz, suggesting that other intramitochondrial targets of diaz may play a role in this in
vivo effect.
at present, we do not know if the diaz-induced
preservation of mitochondrial morphology and ca2 + levels

is directly linked to the well-described neuroprotection
afforded by this drug. theoretically, the observed mitochondrial effects could result in (1) better regeneration of the
oxidative metabolism preventing cell death, (2) decreased
ros production, and (3) decreased apoptotic cell death. in
the piglet, previous studies demonstrated the beneficial
effect of  xxxg1232xxx  openers including diaz on
neuronal function [12,40]. diaz dose-dependently prevented i/r-induced impairment of n-methyl-d-aspartateinduced pial arteriolar vasodilation. 5hd abolished the
effect of diaz, indicating the involvement of mitochondria
in the neuronal protection [10]. the impairment of this
neuronal-vascular response following h/i stress has been
extensively shown to be inflicted by ros on neurons in the
early reoxygenation period [2,8]. the present study demonstrated that diaz could prevent swelling and ca2 + overloading of neuronal mitochondria in this sensitive early
phase of reperfusion. mitochondrial ros production dramatically increases with ca2 + accumulation in vitro [15].
thus, indirect evidence suggests that the acute neuropro-

tective effect of diaz may be, in part, mediated by
decreased ros production.
the prevention of mitochondrial injury to protect neurons emerges as an attractive target to develop rational
therapeutic interventions for stroke management. to prevent
such acute mitochondrial changes during i/r, immediate
treatment is necessary. neonates may be the best candidates
for pretreatment strategies, since babies at risk may be
identified even before the neuronal injury takes place. in
conclusion, further investigation of mkatp with diaz to
evaluate potential therapeutic efficacy is warranted to protect the newborn brain against ischemic injury.
