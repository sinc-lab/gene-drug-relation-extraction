abstract
rationale nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine antagonists have been used for several years as antiparkinsonian
drugs. however, there are at least five subtypes of
muscarinic receptor (m1–5). neostriatal m4 receptors have
been implicated in aspects of motor function, and it has
been suggested that m4 antagonists could be used as
treatments for parkinsonism.
objective currently, there is a lack of highly selective m4
antagonists that readily penetrate the blood brain barrier.
thus, the present studies focused upon the effects of
 xxxd3450xxx , a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist
with moderate binding selectivity for the  xxxg450xxx 
subtype.
materials and methods tremulous jaw movements were
used as a model of parkinsonian tremor in these studies,
and the effects of  xxxd3450xxx  were compared with those of
the nonselective muscarinic antagonist atropine.
results  xxxd3450xxx  suppressed the tremulous jaw movements induced by the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine and

the dopamine antagonist  xxxd2956xxx . analysis of the dose–
response curves indicated that  xxxd3450xxx  showed approximately the same potency as atropine for suppression of
 xxxd2950xxx induced jaw movements but was more potent
than atropine on the suppression of  xxxd2956xxx -induced jaw
movements. in contrast, atropine was more potent than
 xxxd3450xxx  in terms of impairing performance on visual
stimulus detection and delayed nonmatch-to-position tasks.
conclusions these studies demonstrate that  xxxd3450xxx ,
which currently is used clinically for ophthalmic purposes,
can exert actions that are consistent with antiparkinsonian
effects. moreover, the different pattern of effects shown by
 xxxd3450xxx  compared to those of atropine on motor vs
cognitive tasks could be due to the modest m4 selectivity
shown by  xxxd3450xxx .

parkinsonism is a family of movement disorders that can
result from various neuropathological and pharmacological
conditions. degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine (da)
neurons is a major neuropathological feature of idiopathic
parkinson’s disease (bergman and deuschl 2002; marsden
et al. 1975). moreover, parkinsonian symptoms also can be
induced or exacerbated by various drugs, including da
antagonists and da-depleting agents that are used as
antipsychotic drugs (marsden et al. 1975; mcevoy 1983;
tarsy et al. 1975, 2002). although idiopathic parkinsonism
typically is treated by drugs that stimulate da tone (lang
and lees 2002a, b; mailman et al. 2001; pogarell et al.
2002), current models of basal ganglia function indicate

348

that parkinsonian symptoms are produced by neurochemical interactions involving several transmitters in various
parts of basal ganglia circuitry (delong 1990; hauber 1998;
obeso et al. 2000; young and penney 1993; finn et al.
1997b; wichmann et al. 2001; trevitt et al. 2002; carlson
et al. 2003; correa et al. 2003, 2004; wisniecki et al. 2003;
simola et al. 2004). considerable research in this area has
focused upon the pharmacological and neurochemical interactions between acetylcholine (ach) and da (aquilonius
1980; deboer et al. 1993; salamone et al. 1998, 2001).
cholinomimetic drugs can induce or exacerbate parkinsonian symptoms (aquilonius 1980; arai 2000; bourke and
drukenbrod 1998; cabeza-alvarez et al. 1999; duvoisin
1967; harbaugh et al. 1984; iwasaki et al. 1988; kao et al.
1993; keltner 1994; mcswain and forman 1995; noring
et al. 1984; ott and lannon 1992; shea et al. 1998). in
addition, idiopathic and drug-induced parkinsonism can be
treated with muscarinic ach antagonists (aquilonius 1980;
bezchlibnyk-butler and remington 1994; duviosin 1967;
mcevoy 1983; oertel and doedel 1995; katzenchlager
et al. 2003).
although resting tremor is one of the cardinal symptoms
of parkinsonism, relatively few clinical studies have
specifically emphasized the pharmacology of tremor (e.g.,
schrag et al. 2002; navan et al. 2003, 2005), and
considerable uncertainty remains about the neurochemical
mechanisms that underlie tremorogenesis (bergman and
deuschl 2002; deuschl et al. 2001; wilms et al. 1999;
winogrodzka et al. 2001). for these reasons, it is important
to focus attention on the pharmacology and neurochemistry
of tremor, and studies employing animal models are a
critical aspect of this research strategy (wilms et al. 1999).
for several years, there were few reports of parkinsonian
tremor in rodents (cenci et al. 2002; wilms et al. 1999).
nevertheless, one of the rodent behavioral procedures that
has emerged within the last few years as a potential model
of parkinsonian resting tremor is drug-induced tremulous
jaw movements (salamone et al. 1998, 2005; rodriguezdiaz et al. 2001; cenci et al. 2002; ishiwari et al. 2005).
tremulous jaw movements (tjms) have been defined as
rapid and repetitive vertical deflections of the lower jaw
that are not directed at any particular stimulus (salamone
et al. 1998). these movements can be induced by a number
of conditions that parallel the neurochemistry and pathophysiology of parkinsonism, including neurotoxic depletions of neostriatal da (finn et al. 1997a; jicha and
salamone 1991), da-depleting agents such as reserpine
(baskin and salamone 1993; salamone and baskin 1996;
steinpreis and salamone 1993), and acute or subchronic
injections of da antagonists such as haloperidol and
 xxxd2956xxx  (ishiwari et al. 2005; jicha and salamone 1991;
steinpreis et al. 1993; steinpreis and salamone 1993;
trevitt et al. 1997). tjms also are induced by anticholi-

psychopharmacology (2007) 194:347–359

nesterases such as physostigmine or tacrine (carriero et al.
1997; cousins et al. 1997; kelley et al. 1989; mayorga
et al. 1997) and by muscarinic agonists such as  xxxd215xxx  and
pilocarpine (baskin et al. 1994; rupniak 1983; rupniak
et al. 1985; salamone et al. 1986, 1990; stewart et al.
1988). the 3–7 hz frequency of the jaw movements induced
by cholinomimetics, da depletions, and da antagonists
resembles the frequency of resting tremor in parkinsonism
(cousins et al. 1998; finn et al. 1997a; ishiwari et al. 2005;
mayorga et al. 1997; salamone and baskin 1996; salamone
et al. 1998). tjms can be reduced by antiparkinsonian
drugs with various pharmacological profiles, including
diphenhydramine (carlson et al. 2000) and amantadine
(cousins et al. 1997), as well as dopaminergic drugs such
as apomorphine, l-dopa, bromocriptine, pergolide, and
 xxxd3145xxx  (cousins et al. 1997; salamone et al. 2005). the
potency of dopaminergic drugs for suppressing cholinomimetic-induced tjms is highly correlated with the clinical
potency of these drugs for reducing parkinsonian tremor in
humans (salamone et al. 2005). the atypical antipsychotic
clozapine, which is antitremorogenic in parkinsonian
patients, has been shown to suppress cholinomimeticinduced tjms in rats (chesler and salamone 1996; trevitt
et al. 1997, 1998). furthermore, antiparkinsonian muscarinic antagonists such as scopolamine, atropine, benztropine, and trihexyphenidyl have been shown to suppress the
tjms induced either by cholinomimetic drugs (cousins
et al. 1997; mayorga et al. 1997; salamone et al. 1986; stewart
et al. 1988) or by antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol or
reserpine (rupniak 1983; steinpreis et al. 1993; salamone
and baskin 1996).
several papers have suggested that muscarinic antagonists are effective against parkinsonian tremor (schrag et al.
1999; romrell et al. 2003; bain 2002; milanov 2001).
however, the muscarinic antagonists that currently are used
clinically are not highly selective for particular subtypes of
muscarinic receptor. within the last few years, several
muscarinic receptor subtypes (i.e., m1–5) have been
identified (felder 1995; blosser et al. 1997; wess 1996),
which has led to the possibility that selective muscarinic
antagonists could be developed that would have therapeutic utility for the treatment of parkinsonian symptoms
(salamone, 1997; olianas and onali 1999; felder et al.
2000; salamone et al. 2001; santiago and potter 2001).
anatomical and pharmacological research in rats has implicated neostriatal m4 receptors in motor activity, and it has
been suggested that m4 antagonists could be used as treatments for parkinsonism (karasawa et al. 2003; mayorga
et al. 1999; salamone 1997; salamone et al. 2001). the
postsynaptic muscarinic receptors in neostriatum are
predominantly of the m1 and m4 subtypes (oki et al.
2005; santiago and potter 2001). the neostriatum is very
rich in m4 receptors (oki et al. 2005; waelbroeck et al.

psychopharmacology (2007) 194:347–359

1990), and this subtype is mainly present upon striatonigral medium spiny neurons (santiago and potter 2001). the
 xxxg447xxx  subtype appears be less critical for induction
of tjms, as the relatively selective m1 antagonist
 xxxd2965xxx  was shown to be less potent than the m2/m4
antagonists methoctramine and afdx-116 at blocking
 xxxd2950xxx induced tjms after intraventricular injections
(stewart et al. 1988; mayorga et al. 1999; salamone et al.
2001).  xxxg450xxx  knockout mice showed substantially
reduced levels of  xxxd2950xxx induced tjms, as well as
increased spontaneous locomotion (salamone et al. 2001).
these findings led to the suggestion that m4 receptors are
important for the induction of tjms (mayorga et al. 1999;
salamone et al. 2001). in view of the possible therapeutic
utility of selective muscarinic antagonists for the treatment
of parkinsonian tremor, it is important to investigate the
effects of these drugs in animal models. currently, there is
a relative lack of highly selective m4 antagonists that
readily penetrate the blood brain barrier (e.g., wess 2004).
therefore, the present studies focused upon the effects of
 xxxd3450xxx , a muscarinic ach antagonist that shows
moderate binding selectivity (i.e., fivefold) for the m4
receptor subtype (lazareno et al. 1990).  xxxd3450xxx  is a
muscarinic antagonist that currently is used clinically for ophthalmic purposes (vuori et al. 1994), but its potential
antiparkinsonian effects are unknown. although it is not
highly selective for m4 receptors,  xxxd3450xxx  has been used
in previous studies for assessing the functional role of muscarinic receptor subtypes (garcia et al. 2005; lazartigues et al.
1999; parkman et al. 1999; potier and psarropoulou 2004;
shi et al. 1999; ukai et al. 2004; iram and hoyle 2005).
four groups of experiments were conducted to study the
behavioral effects of  xxxd3450xxx  and to compare them with
those produced by the nonselective antimuscarinic atropine.
the first group of experiments assessed the effects of
injections of  xxxd3450xxx  and atropine upon pilocarpineinduced tjms. in the second group of experiments,
 xxxd3450xxx  and atropine were assessed for their effects on
 xxxd2956xxx -induced tjms. the third and fourth groups of
experiments tested the ability of  xxxd3450xxx  and atropine to
impair performance on a visual stimulus detection task and
a delayed nonmatch-to-position task (dnmtp) to obtain
information on relative potency for behavioral effects of
these drugs that may be related to cognition. it was
hypothesized that  xxxd3450xxx  would reduce tjms induced
by pilocarpine and  xxxd2956xxx  and also would impair
stimulus detection and working memory as measured by
the dnmtp task. most importantly, it was hypothesized
that atropine should be more potent than  xxxd3450xxx  at
impairing stimulus detection and memory performance and
that  xxxd3450xxx  would show increased relative potency on
the tjm tasks because of its slightly higher selectivity for
m4 receptors compared to atropine.

materials and methods
animals
male harlan sprague–dawley rats (harlan sprague–dawley,
indianapolis, in, usa; total n=180) with no previous drug
experience were used in these experiments. rats weighed
290–340 g at the beginning of the experiment and had ad
libitum access to water and lab chow during the course of
the experiment. rats were group housed in a colony
maintained at approximately 23°c with a 12-h light/dark
cycle (lights on, 0700 hrs). the animal research protocols
used were approved by the institutional animal care and
use committee at the university of connecticut, and all
procedures were in agreement with the guide for the care
and use of animals.
drugs and selection of doses
 xxxd2956xxx  and atropine were obtained from sigma chemical,
st. louis, mo.  xxxd3450xxx  (n-ethyl-n-(4-pyridylmethyl)
tropamide) was obtained as a 1.0% ophthalmic solution
(henry schein, indianapolis, in, usa) and was dissolved in
0.9% saline. atropine was dissolved in 0.9% saline, which
was used as the vehicle control condition.  xxxd2956xxx  was
dissolved in warm 0.3% tartaric acid, which also was used as
the vehicle control condition.
injection of 4.0 mg/kg pilocarpine i.p. is a standard
procedure for induction of tjms (chesler and salamone
1996; salamone et al. 1990; mayorga et al. 1999). the
subchronic 1.0 mg/kg (i.p.)  xxxd2956xxx  treatment procedure
used in the present studies was based upon previously
published experiments (ishiwari et al. 2005). although acute
 xxxd2956xxx  can induce tjms, the 8-day injection procedure
was chosen because  xxxd2956xxx -induced jaw movement
activity is more robust after repeated subchronic administration (ishiwari et al. 2005). the procedure of screening
animals by assessing them for tjms the day before the drug
challenge day (i.e., observing on day 7 in the  xxxd2956xxx 
experiments) was the same as that used in a previous study
(wisniecki et al. 2003).  xxxd3450xxx  doses were based upon
pilot studies, as well as an initial dose-finding study
involving the reversal of  xxxd2950xxx induced suppression
of locomotion and rearing.  xxxd3450xxx  injected in the dose
range of 0.625–10.0 mg/kg (betz et al., unpublished masters
thesis, data not shown) produced a significant dosedependent reversal in  xxxd2950xxx induced suppression of
locomotion (f(6,54)=4.71, p<0.001; ed50 =1.75 mg/kg,
95% confidence intervals=1.17–3.48 mg/kg) and rearing
(f(6,54)=4.99, p<0.001; ed50 =2.93 mg/kg, 95% confidence intervals=1.77–8.44 mg/kg). based upon these studies, a dose range of 1.25–20.0 mg/kg i.p. was selected for
 xxxd3450xxx  and atropine in experiments 1–8.

observation of tremulous jaw movements
rats were observed for tjms while in a clear plexiglas
chamber (27×17.5×17 cm) with a wire mesh floor. to allow
viewing of the rat from several angles, the chamber was
elevated 42 cm above the tabletop. tjms were defined as
rapid vertical deflections of the lower jaw that resembled
chewing but were not directed at any particular stimulus
(salamone et al. 1998). each individual deflection of the jaw
was recorded by a trained observer using a mechanical hand
counter. all observations were made by an observer who
was blind to the experimental conditions. separate studies
parallel to the present work, which used these methods with
two independent observers, demonstrated an interrater
reliability of r =0.93 (p<0.05). for all jaw movement tests,
rats were placed in the observation chamber and allowed to
habituate for 10 min. rats were observed for tjms for a
5-min period that began after the 10-min habituation.
visual stimulus detection task
details related to training and testing of subjects on the
stimulus detection task have been previously reported
(mclaughlin et al. 2005). in summary, rats were tested in
operant chambers (med associates, st. albans, vt) for
30 min/day, 5 days/week. the chambers were controlled by
an ibm-compatible computer running custom-written software. on one wall in each chamber were two fixed
response levers with a cue lamp 2 cm above each lever,
and a food delivery area recessed into the wall between the
levers. each trial began with brief illumination of one of the
two cue lamps. each correct response, defined as a response
on the lever nearest the cue lamp signal within 15 s of
offset of the cue lamp, was reinforced with a 45-mg pellet
(bioserve, new brunswick, nj). there were three possible
randomly presented stimulus duration times, 100, 300, and
1,000 ms. intertrial interval was fixed at 3 s. previous
studies showed that the anticholinergic drug scopolamine
produces a duration-dependent effect; that is, impairments
are greatest at the shorter stimulus durations when
detectability is likely to be most difficult (presburger and
robinson 1999; mclaughlin et al. 2005). data were
collected separately for each lever, including total number
of lever presses, correct and incorrect responses, trial
omissions (defined as no response within 15 s of cue
offset), and response times (in milliseconds; defined as time
from cue onset to next response, excluding trial omissions).
delayed nonmatch-to-position
the procedures used were based upon those of dunnett
(1985), with slight modifications (see above for details
about the operant chambers). after one magazine training

psychopharmacology (2007) 194:347–359

session, rats were trained on cued spontaneous alternation in
which one cue lamp was illuminated to indicate the correct
lever. a correct response resulted in extinguishing of the
lamp, delivery of one food pellet, and illumination of the other
cue lamp to indicate that pressing the alternate lever would
result in reinforcement. the food tray illuminated between
correct responses to indicate the availability of a food pellet.
after acquisition of alternation (i.e., three consecutive
sessions of at least 150 pellets and >80% accuracy), rats were
switched to the nonmatch-to-position protocol. trials commenced with a snout poke into the food tray that initiated a
sample phase in which one cue lamp was randomly
illuminated. when a rat pressed the signalled lever, the cue
lamp was extinguished and the food tray was illuminated. to
initiate the choice phase, rats needed to poke their snout into
the tray, which illuminated both cue lamps. finally, to
complete the nonmatch-to-position, rats were required to
respond on the lever opposite the one that was previously
cued. response on either lever extinguished both lights and
ended the trial, but a correct nonmatch resulted in delivery of a
food pellet. when performance exceeded 75% correct for
three consecutive trials, rats were moved to the final version of
the task, which introduced a delay phase of 1, 6, 11, or 16 s
between the sample and choice phases. the delay phase began
when rats held a snout poke response in the illuminated tray
for the duration of the delay and ended with the extinguishing
of the tray lamp and illumination of the cue lamps to indicate
that the choice phase had begun. delay lengths and side of the
reinforcing lever were varied randomly across each trial. in
the final version of the task, cue lamps during the sample and
choice phases were illuminated for 10 s. failure to respond
during the 10 s window terminated the trial, as did cessation of
the snout poke before the end of the delay phase. sessions
lasted 40 min and were conducted 5 days/week.
experiments 1 and 2: effect of  xxxd3450xxx  and atropine
on  xxxd2950xxx induced tjms
all rats received an i.p. injection of 4.0 mg/kg pilocarpine
on the test day. in experiment 1, rats also received the
following treatments of vehicle or  xxxd3450xxx  at the same
time as the pilocarpine injection: saline vehicle control,
1.25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, 10.0 mg/kg, and
20.0 mg/kg  xxxd3450xxx  i.p. (n=12). in experiment 2, rats
received the following treatments of vehicle or atropine in
addition to pilocarpine: saline vehicle control, 1.25 mg/kg,
2.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, 10.0 mg/kb and 20.0 mg/kg atropine
i.p. (n=12). immediately after injections, rats were placed
in the chamber for habituation (10 min), and then tjms
were assessed in a 5-min observation period as described
above. a within-groups design was used for both experiments, with the rats in each experiment receiving all
treatments, once per week, in a randomly varied order.

psychopharmacology (2007) 194:347–359

experiments 3 and 4: effect of  xxxd3450xxx  and atropine
on  xxxd2956xxx -induced tjms
all rats received an i.p. injection of 1.0 mg/kg  xxxd2956xxx  for
eight consecutive days. on day 7 of the subchronic injection
procedure, rats were tested for the induction of tjms in a 5-min
session, which followed a 10-min habituation period that was
initiated 3 h and 50 min after their daily  xxxd2956xxx  injections.
only the rats that had ≥15 jaw movements on day 7 were used
for the day 8 drug tests (one rat was removed for failure to meet
criterion). for the day 8 behavioral observation in experiment 3,
all rats were treated with 1.0 mg/kg  xxxd2956xxx  and were
randomly assigned to receive one of the following doses of
vehicle or  xxxd3450xxx : saline vehicle control, 1.25 mg/kg,
2.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, 10.0 mg/kg, and 20.0 mg/kg  xxxd3450xxx 
i.p. (n=10–12 for each group; 3 h and 50 min after  xxxd2956xxx 
injection). for the day 8 behavioral observation in experiment
4, all rats were treated with 1.0 mg/kg  xxxd2956xxx  and were
randomly assigned to receive one of the following doses of
atropine: saline vehicle control, 1.25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg,
5.0 mg/kg, 10.0 mg/kg, and 20.0 mg/kg atropine i.p. (n=
8–12 for each group; 3 h and 50 min after  xxxd2956xxx  injection).
immediately after injection of vehicle,  xxxd3450xxx , or atropine
in each experiment, rats were placed in the chamber for a 10min habituation session, and after habituation, tjms were
assessed in a 5-min observation period as described above.
experiments 5 and 6: effect of  xxxd3450xxx  and atropine
on visual stimulus detection
rats (n=8 per experiment) were trained as described above
on the stimulus detection task. after several weeks of
baseline training, drug testing began. a within-groups design
was used, with all rats receiving all treatments, once per
week, in a randomly varied order, over the course of the
experiment. the following drug treatments were used in
experiment 5: saline vehicle control, 1.25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg,
5.0 mg/kg, 10.0 mg/kg, and 20.0 mg/kg  xxxd3450xxx  i.p. in
experiment 6, the following drug treatments were used:
saline vehicle control, 1.25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg,
10.0 mg/kg, and 20.0 mg/kg atropine i.p. rats were placed
in the test chamber 10 min after drug injection in each
experiment. baseline training (i.e., nondrug) sessions were
conducted four additional days per week, and data (not
shown) were analyzed from these baseline sessions to ensure
that there were no carry-over effects of the drug.
experiments 7 and 8: effect of  xxxd3450xxx  and atropine
on working memory (dnmtp)
rats (n=7 per experiment) were trained as described above,
and testing began approximately 10 weeks after training
began. drug testing began when session performance stabi-

351

lized (i.e., accuracy was consistent for four consecutive
sessions). for experiment 7, the drug treatments were as
follows: saline vehicle, 1.25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg,
10.0 mg/kg, and 20.0 mg/kg  xxxd3450xxx . for experiment 8,
the drug treatments were 1.25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg,
10.0 mg/kg, and 20.0 mg/kg atropine, and saline vehicle.
drugs were given i.p. 10 min before test sessions once per
week in a partially counterbalanced, within-subjects design.
baseline training (i.e., nondrug) sessions were conducted four
additional days per week.
data analysis
for all experiments, tremulous jaw movement data were
analyzed using analysis of variance (anova). planned
comparisons using the overall error term were used to assess
the differences between each drug condition and the vehicle
control condition, keeping the total number of comparisons to
the number of conditions minus 1 (keppel 1991). data for the
discrimination experiments were analyzed with multifactorial
repeated-measures anova. accuracy was analyzed with
dose and duration as factors, but for fig. 3 and the analyses
of dose–response curves, the data were collapsed across
durations to yield an overall accuracy measure. trial
omissions were analyzed with dose and lever (left or right)
as within-subjects factors. response times were analyzed
with a three-way anova in which dose, side, and also
outcome (i.e., whether the trial resulted in a correct or an
incorrect response) as within-subjects factors. to examine
potential drug-induced response biases, a version of the
nonparametric responsivity index (ri; frey and colliver
1973) was used. this measure has previously been adapted
from signal detection theory by arbitrarily assigning one
lever as the “hit” lever and the other as the “correct rejection”
lever (sahgal 1987; mclaughlin et al. 2005). because the
direction of bias (left vs right) can vary between subjects and
test days, absolute values of ri were recorded. the main
memory measure in the dnmtp was accuracy during the
choice phase. a two-way, 6×4 anova was used in which
dose condition and delay were factors. however, there were
no significant interactions, and for fig. 4 and the analyses of
dose–response curves, the data were collapsed across delays

were performed comparing each dose to mean vehicle
performance using the error term from a one-way anova
with dose as the lone independent variable and accuracy
irrespective of delay as the dependent variable. in addition,
drug effects on accuracy during the sample phase were
analyzed with a one-way anova. number of trials was also
analyzed with one-way anova. the ed50 for each drug
effect across different experiments was determined by using
curvilinear regression analysis (graphpad prism), which
employed an exponential decay function to fit the data. these

dose-by-duration interaction (f(10,70)=2.244, p<0.05).
planned comparisons demonstrated that the 10.0 and
20.0 mg/kg doses of  xxxd3450xxx  produced significant impairments relative to vehicle injection (p<0.05). as expected,
significant effect of duration was also found (f(2,14)=75.06,
p<0.001). atropine also significantly impaired accuracy on
this task (f(5,35)=10.12, p<0.001), with the 5.0, 10.0, and
20.0 mg/kg doses significantly differing from vehicle (p<
0.05). while duration also affected accuracy (f(2,14)=49.24,
p<0.001), there was no significant treatment × duration
interaction.
as shown in table 1,  xxxd3450xxx  dose-dependently
increased trial omissions (f(5,35)=15.57, p<0.001), but this
effect did not interact with lever (left vs right), and there was
no significant main effect of side of lever. similarly, atropine
increased trial omissions (f(5,35)=22.129, p<0.001) in a
manner that did not depend on side of lever. planned
comparisons revealed that doses of 10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg
 xxxd3450xxx , and all doses of atropine, increased trial
omissions relative to the respective vehicle control in each
experiment. furthermore, neither  xxxd3450xxx  nor atropine
produced a significant response bias as measured by ri.
however, both drugs increased response time in a similar
fashion.  xxxd3450xxx  increased response time (f(5,35)=
26.355, p<0.001), and this effect was related to whether the
trial resulted in a correct or an incorrect response (f(5,35)=
4.460, p<0.005) but was not related to lever side, as shown
by the lack of significant interaction between dose and side.
the three-way interaction between dose, side, and trial
outcome also was not significant. planned comparisons on
the dose factor revealed increased response times at the 10.0
and 20.0 mg/kg doses compared with vehicle control
(table 1). atropine also slowed response times (f(5,30)=
10.342, p<0.001) in a trial outcome-dependent manner (dose
by trial outcome interaction, (f(5,30)=4.481, p<0.005). as
with  xxxd3450xxx , no interactions were found between dose

and side or between dose, side, and trial outcome. planned
comparisons on the dose factor revealed that all doses of
atropine significantly slowed response time vs vehicle.
experiments 7 and 8: effect of  xxxd3450xxx  and atropine
on dnmtp
 xxxd3450xxx  dose-dependently impaired choice accuracy
(f(5,30)=11.07, p<0.001; fig. 4). as expected, performance was affected by delay length (f(3,18)=55.99, p<
0.001), but drug treatment condition did not interact with
delay. using planned comparisons, it was found that the
5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mg/kg doses of  xxxd3450xxx  significantly impaired performance vs the vehicle condition (p<0.05).
similarly, atropine (f(5,30)=13.14, p<0.001) impaired
performance, and an effect of delay length on accuracy was
found (f(3,18)=28.06, p<0.001). as with  xxxd3450xxx , no
interaction was evident between dose and delay. doses of
2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mg/kg of atropine significantly
differed from vehicle performance via planned comparisons.
neither  xxxd3450xxx  nor atropine impaired accuracy to
respond to the signalled stimulus during the sample phase
(data not shown). however, both compounds dose-dependently reduced overall number of trials (data not shown;
 xxxd3450xxx  (f(5,30)=9.05, p<0.001), atropine (f(5,30)=

discussion
the present studies focused upon the effects of  xxxd3450xxx ,
a muscarinic ach antagonist that shows modest binding
selectivity for the  xxxg450xxx  subtype. a series of experiments examined the effects of  xxxd3450xxx  on behavioral
tasks related to motor and cognitive function, and the effects
of  xxxd3450xxx  were compared with those of atropine.
 xxxd3450xxx  suppressed the tremulous movements (i.e.,
tjms) induced by pilocarpine and  xxxd2956xxx  and also impaired discrimination accuracy on a visual stimulus detection

task and working memory using a dnmtp task. analysis of
the dose–response curves indicated that  xxxd3450xxx  showed
approximately the same potency as atropine for suppression
of  xxxd2950xxx induced jaw movements but was more potent
than atropine on the suppression of  xxxd2956xxx -induced jaw
movements. on the other hand, atropine was more potent
than  xxxd3450xxx  in terms of impairing performance on
visual stimulus detection and dnmtp tasks. taken together,
the results of the tjm experiments demonstrate that
 xxxd3450xxx  can exert actions that are consistent with
antiparkinsonian effects. moreover, although these results
must be interpreted with caution, it is possible that the
different patterns of relative potency shown by  xxxd3450xxx 
and atropine are related to the modest m4 selectivity shown
by  xxxd3450xxx .
the results of experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that both
 xxxd3450xxx  and atropine can suppress the tjms induced by
the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine. considerable evidence
indicates that cholinomimetic-induced tjms result from
central stimulation of muscarinic receptors. previous studies
indicate that cholinomimetic-induced tjms are not induced
by systemic administration of drugs such as carbachol, which
do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier (salamone et al.
1986). moreover,  xxxd2950xxx induced tjms were shown to
be blocked by systemic administration of scopolamine but not
by methylscopolamine (salamone et al. 1986). finally, local
administration of cholinomimetics directly into the ventrolateral neostriatum can induce tjms (kelley et al. 1989;
salamone et al. 1990). in view of these data demonstrating
that central stimulation of muscarinic receptors is related to
the induction of tjms, the present results indicate that
systemic administration of  xxxd3450xxx  can lead to a central
blockade of muscarinic receptors that is functionally significant. furthermore, considering that cholinomimetic-induced
tjms have many of the pharmacological characteristics of
parkinsonian tremor (salamone et al. 1990, 1998, 2005), the
present results suggest that  xxxd3450xxx  may be useful for the
treatment of parkinsonian tremor in humans.
in view of the suggestion that  xxxd3450xxx  may have
tremorolytic actions in animal models related to parkinsonism, it is important to provide a detailed characterization of
the effects of this drug. thus, in the present studies, tjms
were induced with two different procedures (i.e.,  xxxd2950xxx induced tjms and  xxxd2956xxx -induced tjms). having
these two different procedures allowed for examination of
the effects of  xxxd3450xxx  under a broader range of
conditions, and there are several reasons why the evaluation
of the effects of  xxxd3450xxx  on  xxxd2956xxx -induced tjms is
critical. one could argue that the reversal of pilocarpineinduced tjms involves a simple displacement of an agonist
from a receptor using a competitive antagonist. although
such studies are important from a pharmacological perspective, they may not provide a very stringent test for the

psychopharmacology (2007) 194:347–359

assessment of antiparkinsonian effects under a broad range
of conditions, including situations in which da transmission is compromised. in addition, previous studies indicated
that the tjms induced by cholinomimetics and da antagonists can have different pharmacological characteristics
(wisniecki et al. 2003). for these reasons,  xxxd3450xxx  was
evaluated for its effect on  xxxd2956xxx -induced tjms in
experiment 3.  xxxd2956xxx  is a da antagonist that is known
to induce parkinsonian side effects, including tremor, in
human patients with schizophrenia (tarsy et al. 1975;
chouinard and annable 1982; claveria et al. 1975; sultana
and mcmonagle 2000). moreover, recent experiments
demonstrated that acute or subchronic administration of
 xxxd2956xxx  in rats can induce tjms that occur largely in the
3–7 hz frequency range that is similar to parkinsonian
tremor (ishiwari et al. 2005). in the present studies,
 xxxd3450xxx  was able to suppress  xxxd2956xxx -induced tjms.
considerable evidence indicates that nonselective muscarinic antagonists that are used as antiparkinsonian drugs, such
as scopolamine and atropine, can suppress da antagonistinduced tjms (rupniak 1983; steinpreis et al. 1993; see
also experiment 4). thus, the observation that  xxxd3450xxx 
suppressed the tremorogenic effects of  xxxd2956xxx  provides
evidence that  xxxd3450xxx  can produce antiparkinsonian
effects in an animal model involving dopaminergic dysfunction. this also is relevant from a clinical perspective
because it may mean that  xxxd3450xxx  could be used as a
treatment for the parkinsonian symptoms that result from
administration of “typical” antipsychotic such as haloperidol or  xxxd2956xxx .
as well as having actions on tests related to motor
dysfunction, both  xxxd3450xxx  and atropine impaired discrimination accuracy on a visual stimulus detection task
(experiments 5 and 6) and impaired accuracy on the
delayed nonmatch-to-position test of working memory
(dnmtp; experiments 7 and 8). on the stimulus detection
task,  xxxd3450xxx  produced a stimulus duration-dependent
effect (i.e., impaired detection of more brief stimuli), while
atropine impaired accuracy in a more nonselective manner.
it is possible that the duration-related effects of  xxxd3450xxx 
on the visual detection task were related to the modest m4
selectivity of this drug. however, it also is true that
scopolamine, which is not selective for different muscarinic
receptors, has produced inconsistent effects in terms of
duration-related changes in accuracy on this type of task
(presburger and robinson 1999; mclaughlin et al. 2005).
at this point, it is difficult to determine what factors
influence the ability of muscarinic antagonists to produce
duration-related effects on this type of procedure. nevertheless, the general effects of  xxxd3450xxx  and atropine on
the stimulus detection task (i.e., impairing accuracy) are
consistent with the well-documented actions of muscarinic
antagonists on discrimination procedures (mcgaughy and

355

sarter 1995a; presburger and robinson 1999; salamone
1986; mclaughlin et al. 2005). although there are some
uncertainties about the specific psychological functions that
are measured by this type of task (mcgaughy and sarter
1995b; sarter et al. 2001), it has been suggested that the
impairments on discrimination tasks induced by muscarinic
antagonists can reflect disruption of processes such as
stimulus detection and processing, response organization
and control, and cognitive functions potentially related to
attention (warburton and brown 1971; bushnell 1990;
presburger and robinson 1999). with the dnmtp task,
both  xxxd3450xxx  and atropine impaired accuracy in a
delay-independent fashion; that is, accuracy was impaired
regardless of how long the to-be-remembered item is
required to be retained over several delay lengths. this is
a similar pattern of disruption to what has been shown with
scopolamine (dunnett 1985; bushnell 1990; robinson
1997). additionally, the number of trials completed by rats
performing the dnmtp task was suppressed by both drugs.
this may suggest nonspecific deficits, however, accuracy
during the sample phase was not affected by either drug.
previous work has shown that scopolamine reduced the
number of trials completed in rats performing on the
dnmtp task (robinson 1997) but did not impair sample
phase accuracy (robinson 1997), which is similar to the
present pattern of results. taken together, the results of
experiments 5–8 indicate that  xxxd3450xxx  and atropine can
affect performance on tasks related to stimulus detection
and memory as well as those related to motor control.
analyses of the dose–response curves for each different
study were performed by calculating the ed50 values and
95% confidence intervals for both drugs. as shown in
table 2, atropine was more potent than  xxxd3450xxx  in terms
of impairing performance on the visual stimulus detection
and dnmtp tasks. for several reasons, it was hypothesized
that atropine would be more potent than  xxxd3450xxx  in
terms of impairing performance on the cognitive tasks. in
previous studies that have compared these drugs, atropine
has been more potent than  xxxd3450xxx  in exerting its
biological actions. for example, lazartigues et al. (1999)
studied the effects of several muscarinic antagonists on the
increased blood pressure induced by the anticholinesterase
physostigmine, which is thought to be mediated by central
m1 and m2 receptors. this response was blocked in a
highly potent manner by atropine (ed50 =3.7 nmol) and by
the m1 antagonist  xxxd2965xxx  (ed50 =10.7 nmol), but
 xxxd3450xxx  had a relatively low potency for this effect,
with an ed50 of 214.2 nmol. additional studies have shown
that  xxxd3450xxx  has a relatively low potency for blocking
functions related to m1 or m2 receptors (parkman et al.
1999; shi et al. 1999; iram and hoyle 2005). the role of
specific muscarinic receptor subtypes in stimulus detection
and memory processes is unknown, and multiple subtypes

356

psychopharmacology (2007) 194:347–359

of muscarinic receptors are likely to contribute to cognitive
functions. nevertheless, evidence indicating that muscarinic
m1, m2, and m3 receptors are important for cognition
(drinkenburg et al. 1995; hagan et al. 1987), coupled with
evidence of the low affinity of  xxxd3450xxx  for these
receptors (lazareno et al. 1990), led to the hypothesis that
 xxxd3450xxx  should have a lower potency than atropine for
the cognitive effects. this hypothesis was supported in
experiments 5–8. nevertheless, this pattern of relative
potency was not observed in the jaw movement experiments. instead,  xxxd3450xxx  showed approximately the
same potency as atropine for suppression of pilocarpineinduced jaw movements and was more potent than atropine
for suppression of  xxxd2956xxx -induced tjms (table 2).
interestingly, the potency difference between the effects of
atropine on  xxxd2956xxx -induced tjms and the cognitive tasks
was approximately twofold (i.e., 4.9 mg/kg vs 7.1 and
10.1 mg/kg), while  xxxd3450xxx  showed a much greater
potency difference on these two tasks (i.e., more than 13and 25-fold, depending upon the task). although several
pharmacological factors could account for the relatively
high potency of  xxxd3450xxx  at blocking tjms, it is
reasonable to suggest that this could be related to the
modest  xxxg450xxx  selectivity shown by  xxxd3450xxx 
(table 3). m4 receptors are present in high concentrations
in the neostriatum (santiago and potter 2001), and, as
described above, m4 receptors have been implicated in the
production of tjms (mayorga et al. 1999; salamone et al.
2001). of course, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by
assessing the effects of drugs with greater m4 selectivity
than  xxxd3450xxx  in future studies.
in summary, the present results indicate that the muscarinic antagonist  xxxd3450xxx  shows tremorolytic effects in
animal models related to parkinsonism. these studies
indicate that  xxxd3450xxx  can exert antiparkinsonian
actions, and it is possible that this drug could be useful

knockout mice (salamone et al. 2001), will be necessary to
determine if the high relative potency shown by  xxxd3450xxx  is related to its actions on muscarinic m4 receptors.
