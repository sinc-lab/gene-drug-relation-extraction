 xxxd94xxx  acts as an antagonist of neuronal nicotinic receptors
'ralph h. loring
dept. of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology, harvard medical school, boston, ma 02115, u.s.a.
1 tritiated  xxxd94xxx  has been used by others in ion flux methods to measure nicotinic receptor function
in neurones. however, as shown here,  xxxd94xxx  blocks nicotinic receptor function in both the chick retina
and the rat superior cervical ganglion at high concentrations.
2 in intact chick retina,  xxxd94xxx  1 mm decreases dimethylphenylpiperazinium (dmpp)-induced depolarizations measured in the optic nerve by approximately 70%, while having little effect on responses
induced by glutamate analogues. dmpp dose-response curves are reduced in a manner consistent with a
non-competitive effect of  xxxd94xxx , and  xxxd94xxx  at 1 mm does not prevent binding of 125i-labelled neuronal bungarotoxin, a snake venom neurotoxin that competitively binds and blocks functional nicotinic
receptors in chick retinal homogenates.
3  xxxd94xxx  (10mm) substantially blocks both dmpp-induced depolarizations of rat superior cervical
ganglion and synaptic transmission through the ganglion. others have established that [3h]- xxxd94xxx 
will pass through nicotinic receptor channels in the rat ganglion. these data suggest that  xxxd94xxx  acts
both as a cation and as a weak channel blocker at neuronal nicotinic receptors.

introduction
nicotinic receptors are fairly non-selective ligand-activated
cationic channels (e.g., huang et al. 1978), various radiolabelled cations have been used in ion flux methods to take advantage of the non-selectivity of the nicotinic channel and to
assay functional receptors (e.g. creese & england, 1970;
takeyasu et al., 1983; messing et al., 1984). however, one
agent, [3h]- xxxd94xxx , has the reported advantage of not only
serving as a tracer for ion flux through the receptor channel
(quik, 1985) but also, as being easily visualized by autoradiography once internalized and fixed in cells with functional
receptors (yoshikami, 1981). in this paper, i present evidence
that, at high concentrations,  xxxd94xxx  ( xxxd94xxx ) acts as an antagonist of neuronal nicotinic receptors. this pharmacological activity may limit the usefulness of
[3h]- xxxd94xxx  as a probe for functional nicotinic receptor
channels.

computer. agonists were applied at intervals of no less than
5min to reduce receptor desensitization. for dose-response
curves, agonists were applied in a pseudo-random order of
concentrations. antagonists were perfused for at least 5min

to preparation

methods
electrophysiological measurements were made of intact chick
retina from the ganglion cell population by use of a modification of the method of loring et al. (1989). briefly, d.c. potentials were measured between a suction electrode placed over
the cut optic nerve (which consists of the cut axons of the
retinal ganglion cells) and a second electrode placed in the
eyecup perfusion medium. the eyecup was superfused at room
temperature with tyrode solution (composition mm: nacl
130, nahco3 20.5, kci 3, dextrose 17 and 0.01% phenol red,
gassed with 95% 02:5% co2) containing mgcl2 7mm and
cacl2 0.1 mm to inhibit synaptic inputs onto the retinal ganglion cells. the major modification was in how the agonist
was applied: instead of applying the nicotinic agonist
dimethylphenylpiperazinium (dmpp) directly to the eyecup
as previously, dmpp was added by a 'sampling loop' consisting of three solenoid valves (figure 1) located in the perfusion
line. the 'sampling loop' was placed within 10cm of the
eyecup to reduce dilution of the applied dmpp en route to
the preparation. operation of the solenoid valves during the
application of agonist triggered data acquisition (r.c. electronics computerscope a/d converter) and storage in a p.c.

figure 1 valve and sample loop configuration: three teflon-coated
solenoid valves obtained from general valve corp. (fairfield, n.j.,
u.s.a.) are mounted as shown above on a 'third hand' manipulator
by bolts connected to the valve bodies. to fill the sample loop, the fill
valve is opened and solution containing the drug is sucked into the
loop by pulling on the plunger of the fill syringe. the fill valve (2 way)
is closed before drug applications. the path of perfusion medium
through the valve assembly during normal operation is shown as
short arrows going from the superfusate reservoir to the preparation.
to apply the drug, valves i and 2 (3-way valves) are opened by a
valve controller (similar to that described by loring, 1985) and the
superfusate travels through the sample loop as indicated by the long
arrows.
the volume of the sample loop (about 200.ul in these experiments)
and the flow rate of the superfusate (about 8 ml min- ' in these
experiments) determine the approximate duration that the prepartion
is exposed to the maximum concentration of the drug (about 1.5 s in
these experiments). to minimize dilution of the drug, the length of line
from valve 2 to the preparation is kept as short as possible (about
10cm). experiments with dyes suggest that drugs are diluted by no
more than 3 fold when the drug reaches the retina. the sample loop
can be rinsed between drug applications. all tubing is intramedic pe
190 polyethylene. the valve ports are labelled as follows: nc, normally
closed; no, normally open; c, common (always open).

receptors. an
eyecup from a two week old chick was perfused with tyrode solution
and stimulated three times each with kainic acid 100pm (open
column), dimethylphenylpiperazinium (dmpp) 100pm (solid column)
and  xxxd3068xxx  (hatched column) (before). the process was
repeated both in the presence of 5mm  xxxd94xxx  (during) and after
washing out the  xxxd94xxx  for 10 min (after). the columns indicate the
mean amplitude of the depolarizations obtained with the different
agonists + s.d. (vertical bars) (n = 3 applications of each agonist). the
depolarizations induced by dmpp were markedly antagonized (86%
decrease) by perfusion with  xxxd94xxx , while those induced by the glutamate analogues kainic acid and  xxxd3068xxx  were unaffected.

results
application of dmpp 100 m to intact chick retina gave rise
to depolarization on the order of 1-4 mv (e.g. figure 2a). previous work established that these responses were mediated
through nicotinic receptors, since the depolarizations were
blocked by incubation of nicotinic antagonists such as hexamethonium, dihydro-f-erythroidine, or (+)- xxxd3456xxx 
(100ym each, loring et al., 1989). repeated application of
100pm dmpp by the 'sample loop' gave rise to depolarizations with a variability in amplitude generally less than
10% of the total depolarization (n = 10 experiments). as long
as intervals of 5 min were used between agonist applications,
little evidence of attenuation in the response was observed.
however, perfusion of chick retina with 1 mm  xxxd94xxx  sub-

 xxxd94xxx  antagonism of nicotinic receptors

stantially blocked the dmpp response (e.g., figure 2b:
67 + 11% blockade in 4 experiments). in contrast, 5mm
 xxxd94xxx  had little or no effect on depolarizations induced by
the glutamate analogues kainic acid or  xxxd3068xxx  (figure 3).
in other experiments,  xxxd94xxx  had no effect on depolarizations induced by the glutamate analogue n-methyl-daspartate (not shown). these data suggest that  xxxd94xxx  selectively acts at the level of the neuronal nicotinic receptor in the
retinal preparation.
in order to determine whether blockade by  xxxd94xxx  was
competitive or non-competitive, the effects of  xxxd94xxx  on the
dmpp dose-response curve were assessed (figure 4a). partial
blockade by 1 mm  xxxd94xxx  depressed the maximal response
to dmpp suggesting a non-competitive action of  xxxd94xxx 
(n = 4 experiments). in two of the four experiments,  xxxd94xxx 
clearly decreased the slope of the response to dmpp, also
suggesting a non-competitive effect of  xxxd94xxx . however, in
the other two experiments (such as shown in figure 4a), the
slope of the dose-response curve was not dramatically
affected, but shifted to the right, although the maximal
response was always depressed. these data suggest that  xxxd94xxx  may act as a mixed competitive and non-competitive
antagonist at nicotinic receptors in the chick retina. for comparison, the effects of a competitive antagonist, dihydro-f-erythroidine (3 m) are shown in figure 4b, in which the
competitive antagonist clearly shifts the dose-response curve
to the right without significantly affecting the slope or
maximal response. also, as shown in figure 4c, the noncompetitive antagonist hexamethonium (20 pm), reduced both
the maximum response and the slope of the response to
dmpp.
additional evidence for a non-competitive nature of the
blockade by  xxxd94xxx  comes from the displacement of a snake
toxin that competitively blocks neuronal nicotinic receptors
(figure 5). variously referred to as bungarotoxin 3.1 (ravdin
& berg, 1979), toxin f (loring et al. 1989), c-bungarotoxin
(chiappinelli, 1983), and neuronal bungarotoxin (higgins &
berg, 1988; loring et al. 1989), neuronal bungarotoxin (nbt)
blocks nicotinic receptor function in a variety of neuronal
preparations including chick ciliary ganglion (e.g., ravdin &
berg, 1979), rat retina (lipton et al., 1987), chick retina
(loring et al., 19.89), and bovine chromaffin cells (e.g., higgins
& berg, 1988). in both the chick ciliary ganglion (halvorsen &

berg, 1986) and the chick retina (loring et al., 1989), 25.ilabelled nbt binding is displaced by competitive but not by
non-competitive, antagonists for neuronal nicotinic receptors.
[125i]-nbt binds to two sites in homogenates of chick
retina, one site representing a non-functional binding site
shared with the neuromuscular blocking toxin, abungarotoxin, and a second site that corresponds to functional nicotinic receptors on the chick retinal ganglion neurones
(loring et al., 1989). to study [125i]-nbt binding to functional nicotinic receptors in chick retina, binding of [125i]_
nbt to the non-functional site shared with a-bungarotoxin
had first to be blocked by incubation in the presence of 1 ym
unlabelled a-bungarotoxin. under these conditions, 1mm
 xxxd94xxx  did not significantly displace [1251]-nbt binding to
chick retinal homogenates (figure 5) a concentration at which
 xxxd94xxx  significantly depressed nicotinic receptor function in
the chick retina (figure 4a).  xxxd94xxx  did start blocking
[1251]-nbt binding at 10mm, however the displacement was
less than 50%. at 5mm  xxxd94xxx , nicotinic receptor function
was virtually abolished (86% block) in the intact chick retina
(figure 3). thus, the effects of  xxxd94xxx  on the dose-response
curves of dmpp and the lack of displacement of [125i]-nbt
binding by  xxxd94xxx  at concentrations that blocked the functional receptors both suggest thet the major action of  xxxd94xxx  was as a non-competitive blocker, while leaving open the
possibility of some mixed activity.
since [3h]- xxxd94xxx  was reported to be a useful probe for
functional nicotinic receptors in intact rat superior cervical
ganglia (quik, 1985), the effect of  xxxd94xxx  on nicotinic receptor function in intact rat ganglia was also determined. dmpp
(100pm) produced depolarizations in rat superior cervical ganglion of greater than 1 mv (figure 6a). application of 1omm
 xxxd94xxx  for 5-20min (figure 6b) substantially blocked this
depolarization (80 + 15%, n = 3 experiments). the effect of
 xxxd94xxx  on synaptic transmission through the ganglion was
also examined. figure 6c shows transmission elicited by
stimulation of the preganglionic nerve under control conditions. figure 6d shows that 10mm  xxxd94xxx  completely
blocked nicotinic transmission in the rat ganglion.  xxxd94xxx 
(1 mm) also antagonized both synaptic transmission through
the chick ciliary ganglion and depolarizations due to applied
agonists (data not shown). since tetrodotoxin blocks only
transmission but not agonist-induced depolarizations in the
chick ciliary ganglion preparation (loring, 1985), the effects of
 xxxd94xxx  on the agonist-induced depolarizations in chick
ciliary ganglion again strongly suggest that the effect of  xxxd94xxx  was at the level of the postsynaptic receptor and was not
due to blockade of axonal conduction.

figure 5 displacement of ['25i]-neuronal bungarotoxin (nbt) by
 xxxd94xxx  in homogenates of chick retina. quadruplicate samples of
retinal homogenates from 13 day-old white leghorn cockerels
(approximately 1/3 retina per sample) were incubated in the presence
of a-bungarotoxin 11m, [125i]-nbt 2nm and the indicated concentrations of  xxxd94xxx  for 2h at room temperature. bound label was
separated from unbound by a centrifugation assay (loring et al.,
1989). specific binding was determined by subtracting the counts
bound to quadruplicate samples incubated as above but including
jm unlabelled nbt.

many isotopes and radiocompounds have been used in isotopic flux studies of nicotinic receptor function. in some of the
earliest studies, labelled  xxxd1820xxx  was found to accumulate intracellularly near endplate regions in muscle (creese
& england, 1970; creese & maclagan, 1970). in the latter
study, pretreatment with (+)- xxxd3456xxx  substantially
decreased the intracellular accumulation of labelled agonist,
suggesting that the  xxxd1820xxx  transport into muscle was
mediated through the nicotinic receptor itself. the accumulation of label was demonstrated by light-level autoradiography
which also demonstrated a major difficulty found for most
radiocompounds that pass through the nicotinic receptor
channel: in most cases, the radiocompounds, including  xxxd1820xxx , cannot be fixed by traditional fixation techniques.
this necessitated that the studies of creese & maclagan (1970)
were done by the technically difficult method of cutting and
applying autoradiographic emulsion to frozen tissue sections
to prevent diffusion of the labelled compound.
in 1981, yoshikami used [3h]- xxxd94xxx  (1 amino-4
guanido butane) to demonstrate nicotinic receptor-mediated

flux in the frog sympathetic ganglion. as a polyamine,  xxxd94xxx  is a cation at physiological ph, and is readily fixed by
aldehydes. [3h]- xxxd94xxx  can be obtained at high specific
activities by enzymatic decarboxylation of [3h]-arginine.
finally, unlike many other polyamines,  xxxd94xxx  has no
known specific uptake mechanism into eucaryotic cells. subsequently, quik (1985) used [3h]- xxxd94xxx  to demonstrate the
nicotinic receptor blocking properties of a snake venom
neurotoxin in the rat superior cervical ganglion.
this present study was based on earlier attempts to use
[3h]- xxxd94xxx  as a probe to demonstrate the localization of
functional nicotinic receptors in the chick retina. previous
work (loring, et al., 1989) suggests (1) that many retinal ganglion cells in the chick retina possess functional nicotinic
receptors, (2) that these receptors are sensitive to blockade by
the snake venom neurotoxin referred to as neuronal bungarotoxin, and (3) that [125i]-neuronal bungarotoxin binding is
localized to two bands in the inner plexiform layer of the
chick retina that correspond to two bands that stain for the
enzyme, choline-acetyltransferase. the object was to see if
[3h]- xxxd94xxx  selective uptake could be demonstrated in

these same parts of the chick retina following stimulation by
nicotinic agonists. however, preliminary experiments failed to
demonstrate specific uptake of [3h]- xxxd94xxx  in chick retina
(data not shown), when the labelled compound was applied in
either the presence or absence of specific nicotinic agonists.
the present study was undertaken to determine whether the
pharmacology of the nicotinic receptor on chick retinal ganglion cells differed in some substantial way from that of the
nicotinic receptor found in the frog or rat sympathetic ganglion. instead, the chick retinal receptor was found to differ
from the rat superior cervical ganglion receptor only in
degree. nicotinic receptors in both preparations are sensitive
to blockade by  xxxd94xxx  and hexamethonium and in both
cases, complete blockade required about 10-50 fold more
 xxxd94xxx  than hexamethonium. the major difference between
the two preparations was that the rat sympathetic ganglion is
about 10 fold less sensitive to either of these agents than is the
chick retina.
it should be pointed out that  xxxd94xxx  and hexamethonium
bear at least superficial similarities in chemical structure. at a
physiological ph, the majority of  xxxd94xxx  molecules are
positively charged both on the free amino group and on the
guanidinium group. furthermore, the molecular distance
between these charges is similar to the distance between the
two quaternary amines of hexamethonium. from the work of
quik (1985) it is clear that [3h]- xxxd94xxx  does penetrate a
sufficient number of nicotinic receptor channels in rat ganglion to be a useful probe for ion flux through the receptor.
however, those experiments were performed at a concentration of 1-3 pm [3h]- xxxd94xxx , concentrations some 1000 fold
lower than that needed to block a significant fraction of nicotinic receptors in the rat superior cervical ganglion. one
hypothesis to explain these data would be that  xxxd94xxx  has a
small but finite probability of blocking the receptor as the
compound travels through the open receptor channel. thus,
at high concentrations of  xxxd94xxx , sufficient  xxxd94xxx  would
pass through the open channel that the receptor would most
probably be blocked at some point. other possibilities include
a low affinity binding site outside the channel.
independent of the mechanism by which  xxxd94xxx  blocks
neuronal nicotinic receptors, it is reasonable to ask whether
hexamethonium, like  xxxd94xxx , will also pass through
nicotinic receptors at concentrations below those causing
blockade of the receptor. this possibility seems more plausible
since the chemically similar compound,  xxxd1820xxx ,
appears to travel through the muscle nicotinic receptor
channel (creese & maclagan 1970). in addition,  xxxd1820xxx  has been shown to block the muscle nicotinic receptor
channel at high concentrations (adams & sakmann, 1978).
hexamethonium is believed to act by blocking neuronal nicotinic receptor channels at effective doses (ascher et al., 1979).
interestingly, the question has also been raised whether acetylcholine itself penetrates the muscle nicotinic receptor channel
(sine & steinbach, 1984), since it has been demonstrated that,
at high concentrations, both acetylcholine and suberyldicholine block nicotinic receptors in vesicles from electric
organs of fish (takeyasu et al., 1983), at the frog neuromuscular junction (ogden & colquhoun, 1985), and in a
muscle cell line (sine & steinbach, 1984).
a major question then, is why [3h]- xxxd94xxx  is a useful
probe for ion flux assays of receptor function in rat and frog
sympathetic ganglia and not in the chick retina? one answer
may be more anatomical than pharmacological. in the frog
and rat ganglia, synaptic profiles and presumably the nicotinic
receptors are often observed on or near the postsynaptic
neuronal cell body (e.g. marshall, 1981). in contrast, the localization of ['25i]-nbt in the chick retina suggest that the
functional nicotinic receptors are located on fine dendritic
processes in the inner plexiform layer (loring et al., 1989). the
internal volume of the dendritic processes may simply not be
large enough to trap sufficient [3h]- xxxd94xxx  relative to
background. alternatively,  xxxd94xxx  may discriminate
between the ionic channels of the different subtypes of neuro-

 xxxd94xxx  antagonism of nicotinic receptors

nal nicotinic receptors known to be present in various parts of
both the rat and chick nervous systems (reviewed by steinbach & ifune, 1989).
regardless of the ultimate differences between nicotinic
receptors in the chick retina versus those in the rat superior
cervical ganglia,  xxxd94xxx  clearly has a pharmacological effect
on both of these preparations. non-competitive blockade of
nicotinic receptor channels may limit the useful concentration
of [3h]-agrnatine available for studying ion flux through nicotinic channels. however, a clear understanding of how agma-

tine and similar drugs, such as hexamethonium block receptor
channel function may ultimately lead to better understanding
of how the receptor channel operates.
