background: newborn screening for deficiency in the
lysosomal enzymes that cause fabry, gaucher, krabbe,
niemann–pick a/b, and pompe diseases is warranted
because treatment for these syndromes is now available
or anticipated in the near feature. we describe a multiplex screening method for all five lysosomal enzymes
that uses newborn-screening cards containing dried
blood spots as the enzyme source.
methods: we used a cassette of substrates and internal
standards to directly quantify the enzymatic activities,
and tandem mass spectrometry for enzymatic product
detection. rehydrated dried blood spots were incubated
with the enzyme substrates. we used liquid-liquid
extraction followed by solid-phase extraction with silica
gel to remove buffer components. acarbose served as
inhibitor of an interfering acid ␣-glucosidase present in
neutrophils, which allowed the lysosomal enzyme implicated in  xxxg826xxx  to be selectively analyzed.
results: we analyzed dried blood spots from 5 patients
with gaucher, 5 with niemann–pick a/b, 11 with
pompe, 5 with fabry, and 12 with  xxxg854xxx , and in
all cases the enzyme activities were below the minimum
activities measured in a collection of heterozygous carriers and healthy noncarrier individuals. the enzyme
activities measured in 5–9 heterozygous carriers were
approximately one-half those measured with 15–32
healthy individuals, but there was partial overlap of
each condition between the data sets for carriers and
healthy individuals.
conclusion: for all five diseases, the affected individuals were detected. the assay can be readily automated,

the application of mass spectrometry in disease diagnostics is rapidly advancing. major applications include (a)
quantification of metabolites in dried blood spots (dbs)6
by tandem mass spectrometry (1 ); (b) identification and
quantification of protein biomarkers in serum by surfaceenhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry
(2 ); (c) analysis of pcr-amplified dna by massarray to
identify mutated genes (3 ); and (d) quantification of
enzyme activities in cell lysates by affinity capture/
elution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (4 ).
among these applications, only the implementation of
tandem mass spectrometry for the detection of inborn
errors of metabolism in dbs has become routine clinical
practice (5, 6 ).
the lysosomal storage diseases are a group of disorders that affect both somatic organs and the central
nervous system. depending on the disorder, they can
manifest from birth to adulthood. until recently, there has
been minimal therapeutic intervention available to alter
the natural course of the disorders, but with the recent
availability of commercial preparations of recombinant
enzymes, selective lysosomal disorders are now amenable
to therapeutic intervention (7–9 ). there is excellent documentation that enzyme replacement therapy for gaucher
disease [acid ␤-glucocerebrosidase (abg) deficiency] and
fabry disease [acid ␣-galactosidase a (gla) deficiency]
may alter the natural progression of the disorders and
improve the clinical phenotype. clinical trials are currently underway for hurler syndrome and  xxxg826xxx

ders that manifest primarily in infancy (10 ). if these
disorders could be detected before the onset of clinical
symptoms, affected individuals would likely benefit from
enzyme replacement therapy. a similar scenario is likely
to evolve for niemann–pick disease, type a and b [acid
sphingomyelinase (asm) deficiency]. for  xxxg854xxx 
[galactocerebroside ␤-galactosidase ( xxxg854xxx ) deficiency],
there is compelling evidence that presymptomatic recognition and bone marrow transplantation may prevent the
neurologic degeneration associated with this disorder.
thus, there is a growing consensus for development of
newborn-screening methods to detect these disorders
before the onset of clinical symptoms so that therapeutic
interventions can be initiated.
in this report we show that it is possible to incubate
rehydrated dbs from newborn-screening cards with
buffer containing substrates for five lysosomal enzymes
and to use tandem mass spectrometry for the multiplex
detection of all five enzymatic products that are relevant
to the diagnosis of fabry, gaucher, krabbe, niemann–
pick, and pompe diseases. our assay has the potential to
allow screening programs to expand their coverage to
include selected lysosomal storage disorders with only a
minimal increase in cost and effort.

materials and methods
materials
all ceramides and glycosylceramides were from avanti
polar lipids. the preparation of substrates (s) and internal standards (is) for the gaa and gla assays (gaa-s,
gaa-is, gla-s, and gla-is; see fig. 1) is described in
the data supplement that accompanies the online version
of this article at http://www.clinchem.org/content/
vol50/issue10/. the compounds are available from the
authors. acarbose was from toronto research chemicals,
inc. recombinant gaa was a gift from dr. j. keutzer
(genzyme, inc., boston, ma). polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) lysate (stored at ⫺20 °c) was prepared by
extracting pmns from purified human blood (11 ) with
buffer containing 50 mmol/l hepes (ph 7.5), 150
mmol/l nacl, 10 g/l triton x-100, 100 ml/l glycerol,
10 mmol/l mgcl2, 1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/l na3vo4, 25 mmol/l naf, 0.5 mmol/l
 xxxd2822xxx , 5 mmol/l glycerophosphate, 2
mmol/l edta, 2 mmol/l egta, 10 g/l aprotinin, 10
g/l pepstatin, and 10 g/l leupeptin. all experiments
with dbs were conducted in compliance with institutional review board review. dbs were kept at ambient
temperature during shipment (⬍10 days) and then stored
at 4 °c or ⫺20 °c, as noted in the figure legends, in
zip-lock plastic bags (one sealed bag inside of a second
sealed bag). all affected patients had been diagnosed
previously with established clinical and biochemical procedures. dbs from nonaffected individuals were obtained
from adults (18 –55 years of age) and infants (3rd to 15th
day postpartum). the age, gender, and date of dbs
collection for all affected patients are listed in table 2 of

the online data supplement, as are the enzyme activity
values.

enzyme assays using 2-mm dbs
we first performed the multiplex enzyme assay using one
2-mm dbs for each of the separate enzymatic reaction
tubes; thus, five 2-mm dbs were needed to assay the five
enzymes. assays in which a single 5-mm dbs was extracted and distributed into the five separate enzyme
reaction tubes will be discussed later.
preparation of solutions. all solvent manipulations were
carried out with pipettors (pipetman; rainin). stock solutions of substrates, internal standards, and products (p)
were prepared and stored in teflon-septum-lined screw
cap vials at ⫺20 °c [3 mmol/l for abg-s, asm-s, and
 xxxg854xxx -s in methanol; 10 mmol/l for gla-s and gaa-s
in methanol; 4 mmol/l for abg-is, asm-is, and
 xxxg854xxx -is in methanol and then diluted to 0.05 mmol/l in
methanol; 10 mmol/l for gla-is and gaa-is in methanol and then diluted to 0.1 mmol/l with h2o–methanol
(2:1 by volume)].
to prepare the asm assay solution, we added 200 ␮l
of 3 mmol/l asm-s solution and 480 ␮l of 0.05 mmol/l
asm-is solution to a 5-ml vial. the solvent was removed
in a desiccator attached to a vacuum pump to give a white
residue. to the residue we added 15 ␮l of 120 g/l
 xxxd3296xxx  in water. the vial was vortex-mixed
until all of the residue was dissolved; we then added 2.985
ml of 0.6 mol/l sodium acetate buffer, ph 5.5. the vial
was vortex-mixed again, and any emulsion was broken by
centrifugation. the final stock assay solution contained
0.2 mmol/l substrate, 8 ␮mol/l internal standard, 0.6
g/l  xxxd3296xxx , and 0.6 mol/l sodium acetate,
ph 5.5. this assay cocktail, as well as all other assay
cocktails, was stored at ⫺20 °c and could undergo multiple freeze–thaw cycles without effect.
to prepare the  xxxg854xxx  assay solution, we added 200 ␮l
of 3 mmol/l  xxxg854xxx -s stock solution and 240 ␮l of 0.05
mmol/l  xxxg854xxx -is solution to a 5-ml vial. the solvent
was removed in a desiccator attached to a vacuum pump
to give a white residue. to this residue we added 240 ␮l
of 120 g/l  xxxd3296xxx  and 12 g/l  xxxd2777xxx 
(aldrich) in water. the vial was vortex-mixed until the
residue had dissolved; we then added 2.76 ml of 0.2
mol/l citrate-phosphate buffer, ph 4.5 (made by dissolving nah2po4 monohydrate in water to 0.2 mol/l, adding
trisodium citrate to 0.1 mol/l, and adjusting to ph 4.5
with 6 mol/l hcl). the vial was vortex-mixed again, and
any emulsion was broken by centrifugation. the final
stock assay solution contained 0.2 mmol/l substrate, 4
␮mol/l internal standard, 9.6 g/l  xxxd3296xxx ,
0.96 g/l  xxxd2777xxx , and 0.18 mol/l citrate-phosphate, ph
4.5.
to prepare the abg assay solution, we added 200 ␮l
of 3 mmol/l abg-s solution and 480 ␮l of 0.05 mmol/l
abg-is solution to a 5-ml vial. solvent was removed in a

desiccator attached to a vacuum pump to give a white
residue. to the residue we added 240 ␮l of 120 g/l
 xxxd3296xxx  in water. the vial was vortex-mixed
until all residue dissolved; we then added 2.76 ml of 0.4
mol/l citrate-phosphate buffer, ph 5.1. the vial was
vortex-mixed again, and any emulsion was broken by
centrifugation. the final stock assay solution contained
0.2 mmol/l substrate, 8 ␮mol/l internal standard, 9.6
g/l  xxxd3296xxx , and 0.37 mol/l citrate-phosphate, ph 5.1.
to prepare the gla assay solution, we added 300 ␮l
of 10 mmol/l gla-s solution and 120 ␮l of 0.1 mmol/l
gla-is solution to a 5-ml vial. the solvent was removed
in a desiccator attached to a vacuum pump to give an oily
residue. to the residue we added 15 ␮l of 120 g/l
 xxxd3296xxx  in water (cat. no. 861960; aldrich).
the vial was vortex-mixed until the residue dissolved; we
then added 105 ␮l of 1 mol/l n-acetylgalactosamine and
1.38 ml of 0.4 mol/l sodium acetate buffer, ph 4.6. the
vial was again vortex-mixed, and any emulsion was
broken by centrifugation. the final assay stock solution
contained 2.0 mmol/l substrate, 8 ␮mol/l internal standard, 1.2 g/l  xxxd3296xxx , 70 mmol/l n-acetylgalactosamine, and 0.37 mol/l sodium acetate, ph 4.6.
to prepare the gaa assay solution, we added 120 ␮l
of 10 mmol/l gaa-s solution, 120 ␮l of 0.1 mmol/l
gaa-is solution, 30 ␮l of 8 mmol/l acarbose in water
(cat. no. a123500; toronto research chemical, inc.), and
1.8 ␮l of triton x-100 to a 5-ml vial. the solvent was
removed in a desiccator attached to a vacuum pump to
give an oily residue. to the residue we added 3 ml of 0.2
mol/l citrate-phosphate buffer, ph 4.0. the vial was
vortex-mixed until the residue was dissolved, and any
emulsion was broken by centrifugation. the final stock
assay solution contained 0.2 mmol/l substrate, 4 ␮mol/l
internal standard, 0.6 g/l triton x-100, 80 ␮mol/l acarbose, and 0.2 mol/l citrate-phosphate, ph 4.2.
incubations. aliquots (25 ␮l for asm,  xxxg854xxx , abg, and
gaa; 12.5 ␮l for gla) of the assay solutions (see above)
were placed in individual 1.7-ml polypropylene eppendorf tubes. to each tube we added a 2-mm-diameter dbs;
we then capped the tubes and centrifuged them at 5000g
(desktop centrifuge) for ⬃ 5–10 s to ensure that all liquid
in each tube was at the bottom. tubes were incubated for
20 –24 h at 37 °c with orbital shaking (150 rpm) in a
thermostated air shaker.
work up. after the desired incubation period, we added
100 ␮l of methanol–chcl3 (2:1 by volume) to each tube
except the  xxxg854xxx  tube, and the liquid in each tube was
mixed by aspiration five times with a pipetman. the
solutions from all tubes were combined in the  xxxg854xxx 
assay tube and mixed by aspiration five times with the
pipetman. to this tube we added 400 ␮l of chcl3
followed by 400 ␮l of h2o (house deionized water). the

1787

tube was centrifuged at 5000g for 2 min in a desktop
centrifuge.
the following steps can also be done in individual
tubes or with a 96-well filter plate. an aliquot (300 ␮l) of
the bottom layer was removed with a pipetman and
transferred directly to a glass-wool-plugged 1-ml pipetman tip that was filled with silica gel (90 –110 mg,
230 – 400 mesh; merck), with the tip placed inside of a
5-ml disposable glass culture tube. solvent was pushed
through the silica gel for ⬃2 s by attaching compressed air
to the top of the pipetman tip. an aliquot (600 ␮l) of 100
ml/l methanol in chcl3 was applied to the silica gel,
and the solvent was pushed through the gel with use of
compressed air. the solvent was removed in a vacuum
desiccator or with a stream of air. the residue was taken
up in 200 ␮l of 5 mmol/l ammonium formate in methanol–chcl3 (3:1 by volume). samples were submitted to
mass spectrometry or stored at ⫺20 °c. for each enzyme
assay, a blank was run as above, using a 2-mm blood-free
filter paper disk.

follows. for abg, we added to a 5-ml vial 200 ␮l of 3
mmol/l abg-s, 480 ␮l of 0.05 mmol/l abg-is, and 240
␮l of 120 g/l  xxxd3296xxx  in water. for the other
lysosomal enzymes we used the following volumes: 200
␮l of 3 mmol/l asm-s, 240 ␮l of 0.05 mmol/l asm-is,
and 15 ␮l of 120 g/l  xxxd3296xxx  in water for
asm; 120 ␮l of 10 mmol/l gaa-s, 120 ␮l of 0.1 mmol/l
gaa-is, 30 ␮l of 8 mmol/l acarbose in water, and 1.8 ␮l
of triton x-100 for gaa; 200 ␮l of 3 mmol/l  xxxg854xxx -s,
240 ␮l of 0.05 mmol/l  xxxg854xxx -is, 240 ␮l of 120 g/l
 xxxd3296xxx , and 12 g/l  xxxd2777xxx  (aldrich) in
water for  xxxg854xxx ; and 300 ␮l of 10 mmol/l gla-s, 120 ␮l
of 0.1 mmol/l gla-is, 15 ␮l of 120 g/l  xxxd3296xxx  in water, 105 ␮l of 1 mol/l n-acetylgalactosamine in water (sigma) for gla.
solvent was removed in a vacuum desiccator to give a
white residue, which was dissolved in a total of 1.8 ml
(see below) of 0.62 mol/l citrate-phosphate, ph 4.95
(made by dissolving nah2po4 monohydrate in water to
0.62 mol/l, adding trisodium citrate to 0.31 mol/l, and
adjusting to ph 4.95 with 6 mol/l hcl) for abg. for the
other lysosomal enzymes we added the following volumes of buffers: 1.8 ml of 0.92 mol/l sodium acetate (ph
5.5) for asm; 1.8 ml of 0.3 mol/l citrate-phosphate (ph
3.89) for gaa; 1.8 ml of 0.3 mol/l citrate-phosphate (ph
4.42) for  xxxg854xxx ; and 300 ␮l of 1.7 mol/l sodium acetate
(ph 4.56) for gla. in all cases, 0.1 ml of solvent was
added, followed by vortex-mixing until the residue was
dissolved and then addition of the remaining solvent.
any emulsion was broken by centrifugation. assay cocktails were stored at ⫺20 °c.
the final abg, asm,  xxxg854xxx , and gaa assay mixtures
were prepared by mixing 15 ␮l of the corresponding
cocktail (see above) with 10 ␮l of dbs extract (see below),

1788

samples were then submitted to mass spectrometry or

dbs extraction. to a single well of a 96-well microtiter
plate (cat. no. 655001; greiner) we added a 5-mm diameter
dbs disc followed by 80 ␮l of 20 mmol/l sodium
phosphate, ph 7.0. the plate was sealed with aluminum
foil tape (cat. no. 3m 425; 3 ⫻ 60; hillas packaging, inc.)
and was incubated for 1 h at 37 °c with orbital shaking
(250 rpm) in a thermostated air shaker.
incubation. to each of 5 wells of a 96-well polypropylene
microtiter plate (cat. no. 21201; e&k scientific, inc.) we
added 10 ␮l of the dbs extraction solution, followed by
15 ␮l of asm,  xxxg854xxx , abg, or gaa assay cocktail or 2.5
␮l of gla assay cocktail (one cocktail per well). the plate
was sealed as above and incubated at 37 °c for 24 h with
orbital shaking (150 rpm).
work up. reactions were quenched by the addition of 100
␮l of methanol–chcl3 (2:1 by volume) to each well. the
solution in each well was mixed by aspiration five times
with a pipetman p200, and all five solutions were combined in 1 well of 96-well deep-well polypropylene plate
(2.2 ml per well; cat. no. 2045; megatier plates; continental lab products). to the combined mixture we added 400
␮l each of chcl3 and h2o. the plate was then placed in
a thermostated air shaker with orbital shaking (250 rpm).
the mixture separated into two layers after 1 h, and 400
␮l of the bottom layer was removed with a pipetman and
applied to a single well of a 96-well filter plate (cat. no.
f20005; innovative microplate inc.) previously loaded
with 100 mg of silica gel (230 – 400 mesh; merck) by a plate
loader (see the online data supplement). the filter plate
was placed in a vacuum manifold (cat. nos. mavm0960r
and mavm0960t; millipore) containing a deep-well
polypropylene plate (cat. no. 2045; megatier plates; continental lab products) as the filtrate receiver. the pressure
in the manifold was reduced by use of an oil pump. after
filtration of the applied solutions, the wells were charged
with 700 ␮l of methanol–chcl3 (1:9 by volume), and
filtration was continued. the solvent was removed from
the receiver plate by use of a vacuum desiccator. the
resulting residue was taken up in 200 ␮l of 5 mmol/l

data were obtained on a sciex api-iii plus triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer controlled by an apple macintosh
quadra 800 computer. the electrospray source operated
in positive mode, and the ions were detected in parent-ion
and neutral-loss scan modes (12 ). in the parent-ion scan,
a selected product ion was passed through the last (q3)
mass analyzer, whereas the first mass analyzer (q1) was
scanned to transmit all precursor ions that gave rise to the
selected product ion. in the neutral-loss scan, both q1and
q3 were scanned such that at any point during the scan
they were offset by a constant mass increment corresponding to the mass of a neutral fragment that was lost
in dissociation. data were acquired by tune2.5 and analyzed by macspec3.3. the instrument was adjusted to
give an optimized response for all analytes (detailed
settings are given in table 1 of the online data supplement). samples were introduced by flow injection
through a fused-silica capillary (i.d. ⫽ 100 ␮m) by use of
a syringe drive (harvard apparatus) at a flow rate of 3.3
␮l/min. the capillary was flushed with acetonitrile (four
times 50 ␮l) after each sample. the amount of product
was calculated from the ion abundance ratio of the
product to the internal standard for a sample minus that
of a blank, multiplied by the amount of added internal
standard and divided by the response factor ratio of
product to internal standard. the enzyme activity in units
of ␮mol 䡠 h⫺1 䡠 (l blood)⫺1 was calculated assuming that
10 ␮l of dbs extraction solution contained one eighth of
the total blood contained in a 5-mm dbs (7.8 ␮l of blood)
(13 ), i.e., 10 ␮l contained 0.98 ␮l of blood.

fig. 1. substrates, products, and internal standards for the five lysosomal enzyme assays.
the masses of the products and internal standards are indicated. the ceramide products and internal standards asm-p, asm-is,  xxxg854xxx -p,  xxxg854xxx -is, abg-p, and abg-is
undergo cid to give the common imminium ion shown (m/z ⫽ 264). gla-p, gla-is, gaa-p, and gaa-is undergo neutral-loss cid to give four different secondary
ammonium ions. enzymatic reactions with dbs are shown by solid arrows, and cid is shown by dashed arrows.

amides and thus are derived from the action of the
lysosomal enzymes on the synthetic substrates without
interference from endogenous natural ceramides. the
structures of the internal standards and products differed
only by the length of the fatty acyl chain (fig. 1) and thus
were differentiated in the mass spectrometer. the electrospray ionization efficiency ratio of each product to the
corresponding internal standard was close to unity for
each pair (see fig. 1 in the online data supplement; see
discussion for a suggestion of the frequency of calibration).
although tandem mass spectrometry allows low-abundance analytes to be detected in complex mixtures, electrospray ionization of analytes is expected to be suppressed by the relatively large amounts of buffer
components present in the dbs reaction mixtures (14 ).
thus, we developed a simple solid-phase extraction
method using silica gel to remove buffer components. the
abg, asm, and  xxxg854xxx  products and internal standards

passed immediately through the silica plug in a multiwell
filter plate, whereas detergent and buffer salts were
trapped on the solid phase. gaa and gla can act on
water-soluble polysaccharide substrates, but we designed
synthetic lipidated substrates that would generate lipidated products (fig. 1) that behaved on silica gel like the
ceramide products. thus, the products and internal standards from all five lysosomal enzyme reaction mixtures
could be processed by a single silica gel purification. all
of the pre-mass spectrometry sample steps were carried
out in multiwell plates, facilitating a high-throughput
analysis.
as shown in fig. 1, all of the products and internal
standards from the abg, asm, and  xxxg854xxx  assays, on
collision-induced dissociation (cid), generated the same
protonated dienylideneimine (m/z 264). thus, parent ion
scanning (also known as precursor ion scanning) of the
ion at m/z 264 allowed all six cations to be quantified. the
gaa and gla products contained an n-linked t-bu-

tyloxycarbonyl group, which provided a route for efficient neutral-loss fragmentation by loss of isobutene and
co2 during cid. thus, we used neutral-loss scanning
(loss of 100 atomic mass units) to selectively quantify the
products and internal standards for the gaa and gla
reactions. the hydrocarbon linkers of gaa-p and gla-p
differed by one –ch2 group and thus were distinguished
in the mass spectrometer; the internal standards were
distinguished from the products by use of the pentadeuterated benzoyl group (a relatively inexpensive isotope
label; fig. 1).

interfering acid ␣-glucosidases
the enzyme gaa, relevant to the diagnosis of pompe
disease, has an acidic ph optimum. use of blood cells as
a source of gaa together with a synthetic substrate is
generally considered to be unreliable because of the
presence of a second acid ␣-glucosidase in pmns, known
as the “renal” enzyme (raag; also known as  xxxg1401xxx 
 xxxg1401xxx ), because of its abundance in the kidneys
(15 ). thus, purified lymphocytes, fibroblasts, or muscle
tissue are recommended for the biochemical diagnosis of
 xxxg826xxx  (16 ). tris (0.1 mol/l) has been reported to
allow partial differentiation of gaa and raag (17 ), but
we have found that the extent of differentiation is insufficient for a robust screening assay (not shown). immunocapture procedures have been developed to allow a
specific assay of gaa (18, 19 ), but the use of an antibody
adds additional steps to the procedure and is too expensive for newborn screening. furthermore, a gaa concentration of 0 has been measured with immunocapture
assays in samples known to contain 10 –20% residual
gaa activity (20 ). selective extraction of water-soluble
gaa from membrane-bound raag has been reported
(21 ), but this method has not worked in our hands when
we used dbs as an enzyme source.
we tested several known ␣-glucosidase inhibitors
against recombinant gaa and a detergent extract of
human pmns as a source of gaa and raag. as shown
in the top panel of fig. 2, acid ␣-glucosidase activity in the
pmn lysate decreased significantly with 0 –10 ␮mol/l
acarbose, whereas recombinant gaa was relatively insensitive to this compound. as can be seen in fig. 2, gaa
was estimated to account for ⬃30% of the total acid
␣-glucosidase activity present in the pmn extract. the
␣-glucosidase inhibitor ghavamiol (22 ) displayed the
opposite specificity. at a concentration of 1 mmol/l, this
compound inhibited ⬃96% of the recombinant gaa
activity and ⬍50% of the activity in the pmn extract (fig.
2, bottom). inhibition studies in which recombinant gaa
was added to the pmn extract showed that all of the
recombinant enzyme was inhibited by 1 mmol/l ghavamiol in the presence of all of the components from the
pmn lysate (fig. 2, bottom). dixon plot analysis indicated
that acarbose inhibits recombinant gaa and pmn
raag, with ki values of 142 and 0.14 ␮mol/l, respectively (not shown). this analysis also yielded km values of

f, recombinant gaa; , pmn enzymes; ■, recombinant gaa ⫹ pmn enzymes.
pmn enzyme activity was measured in a triton x-100 lysate of pmns. assays
were performed as described in materials and methods except that the incubation time was 70 min, with 2.3 ng of recombinant gaa and 1.3 ␮g of pmn protein
used per assay.

0.73 and 0.36 mmol/l for gaa-s acted on by gaa and
pmn raag, respectively. other ␣-glucosidase inhibitors
were tested, but none were highly selective for gaa or
raag (see the online data supplement). we cannot be
certain that gaa and raag are the only enzymes in
pmns responsible for the acid ␣-glucosidase activity, but
the combined data strongly suggest that acarbose can be
used to selectively block the non-gaa acid ␣-glucosidase
activity present in dbs. the data below also support the
usefulness of acarbose inhibition for the analysis of
 xxxg826xxx .

optimization of assays
in principle, it should be possible to hydrate the dbs with
a single buffer containing all five enzyme substrates and

clinical chemistry 50, no. 10, 2004

subject the reaction mixture to tandem mass spectrometry. however, after considerable effort, we were unable to
find a single buffer that supported optimal activity of all
five enzymes. the activity of each enzyme depends critically on ph and detergent concentration (see figs. 2 and
3 in the online data supplement) and buffer composition.
for example, the activity of asm in citrate-phosphate (ph
5.5) was 50% that measured in sodium acetate at the same
ph. each enzyme was therefore assayed in its preferred
buffer, and reaction mixtures were combined before purification and injection of a single solution into the tandem
mass spectrometer.
the amount of product for each enzyme assay increased in a linear fashion during incubation periods of
0 –24 h (fig. 3). for the asm and gla assays, the amount
of product was proportional to the area of the dbs up to
6.3 mm2 (2 ⫻ 2 mm dbs), but for the abg, gaa, and
 xxxg854xxx  assays, the plots were linear only up to a dbs area
of 1.6 mm2 (0.5 ⫻ 2 mm dbs; fig. 4). a flattening of the
product-vs-dbs-area curve was observed at higher dbs
areas. this is presumably attributable to the presence of
one or more inhibitors in the blood because increased dbs
area would lead to an increase in the inhibitor/substrate
ratio, which determined the percentage of enzyme in the
inhibited form. this hypothesis is supported by the observation that better linearity was observed when the
assay volume was increased from 25 to 50 ␮l with the
concentration of substrate held constant (not shown).
for all five enzymes, the amount of product showed a
hyperbolic dependence on the substrate concentration
(see fig. 4 in the online data supplement), and km values
of 0.28, 0.058, 0.74, 0.24, and 3.0 mmol/l were obtained
for abg-s, asm-s, gaa-s,  xxxg854xxx -s, and gla-s, respec-

tively. these are presumably apparent km values; the
actual values could be lower because of the possible
presence of endogenous inhibitors in dbs.
the final assay conditions are given in table 1. all
conditions were optimized so that the cost of materials
was minimized but the amount of enzymatic product was
sufficient for reliable quantification by tandem mass spectrometry. in addition, reaction conditions were optimized
to allow for the use of a common incubation time (20 –24
h), an advantage for high-throughput screening.
the use of a universal extraction buffer to extract a
single dbs per patient for subsequent distribution into
five assay reactions is advantageous for screening because
it avoids the need to obtain several punches from the
same dbs. this also reduces variation caused by inhomogeneous distribution of blood on the filter paper. we
explored several extraction buffers to obtain the universal
buffer given in the materials and methods. we compared
the activities of the five enzymes when a single 2-mm dbs
was used in each reaction mixture with that obtained
when a 5-mm dbs was first extracted with universal
buffer and the extract aliquoted into enzymatic reaction
mixtures (data normalized to equivalent amount of blood
assuming that a 2-mm dbs contains 1.25 ␮l of blood).
the extraction efficiencies obtained with the universal
buffer described in the material and methods were measured in 16 independent trials (four dbs from healthy
adults, obtained between 2000 and 2003). the mean (sd)
values were 50 (5)%, 47 (3)%, 51 (7)%, 70 (5)%, and 28 (2)%
for abg, asm,  xxxg854xxx , gaa, and gla, respectively.
higher extraction efficiencies for some enzymes could be
achieved under different conditions, but we selected the
buffer that gave the highest amount of  xxxg854xxx  because this
enzyme has the lowest specific activity of the five tested.

li et al.: multiplex assay of dbs for newborn screening

enzyme activities
we examined the sample-to-sample reproducibility of the
five enzyme assays by performing 14 independent assays
for each enzyme. for this analysis, we took 14 punches
from the newborn-screening card of a single patient (each
card has five dbs). we could obtain up to eight punches
per dbs; each punch was taken at a fixed radial distance
from the dbs center (⬃4 mm). each assay was carried out
with a single 2-mm dbs per assay tube (for the details, see
materials and methods). the cvs were 9.9%, 8.3%, 9.7%,
5.2%, and 4.6% for the abg, asm,  xxxg854xxx , gaa, and gla
assays, respectively. we also tested the within-run reproducibility of the tandem mass spectrometry analysis by
analyzing the same post-silica-purification assay mixture
17 times over a 2-month period. the cvs were 8.1%, 6.6%,
5.6%, 3.3%, and 4.8% for the abg, asm,  xxxg854xxx , gaa,
and gla assays, respectively.
we then measured the activity of five enzymes, using
dbs from noncarrier healthy adults, obtained between
2000 and 2003 and stored in sealed plastic bags at 4 °c.
the results (fig. 5) showed that the activities of four of the
five enzymes did not vary with the age of the dbs (paired
t-test, p ⬎0.05). the exception was  xxxg854xxx , which showed
a decrease in activity over the 4-year period ( xxxg854xxx 
activity in samples obtained in 2000 was 50% of that in
samples obtained in 2003, 78% of the activity in samples
obtained in 2001, and 85% of the activity in samples
obtained in 2002). we therefore concluded that the stabilities of the five enzymes in the dbs stored at 4 °c are
sufficient if used for newborn screening and, except for
 xxxg854xxx , sufficient for retrospective analysis over a 4-year
period. on the basis of these data, subsequent assays (see
below) for  xxxg854xxx  were carried out with dbs from 2003,

whereas the other four assays were carried out with dbs
from 2000 –2003.
the activities of all five enzymes in affected patients,
heterozygous carriers, healthy adult noncarriers, and
healthy infants (age ⬍1 year) are shown in fig. 6. for all
assays, the dbs were extracted with universal extraction
buffer. the data are presented in tabular data in table 2.
for abg, asm, gaa, and gla, all patients showed
deficient enzyme activity that was unambiguously distinguished from the activities in heterozygotes and healthy
persons. the mean activity of obligate heterozygotes was
approximately one half the mean activity in healthy
adults, but the range of activities partially overlapped.
dbs from patients with  xxxg854xxx  (2003) had lower
 xxxg854xxx  activities than dbs from healthy adults and infants
whose dbs were collected in the same year. no data were
obtained for  xxxg854xxx  heterozygotes (because of a lack of
dbs). for all enzymes except abg, the mean enzyme
activities in healthy infants were higher than in healthy
adults (fig. 6), but the lower ends of the activity ranges of
healthy adults and infants were approximately the same.
the activities of all five enzymes in patients, heterozygotes, healthy adults, and healthy infants as measured
with assays using a single 2-mm dbs per reaction (rather
than extraction of a single 5-mm dbs) are shown in fig. 7.

using a single 2-mm dbs per reaction (fig. 7) were higher
than those obtained by extraction of a single 5-mm dbs
(fig. 6) because of incomplete extraction of the single
5-mm dbs, as noted above. however, the differences in
enzyme activities among patients, heterozygotes, and
healthy controls shown in fig. 6 were consistent with the
results obtained with use of a 2-mm dbs for each assay
reaction (fig. 7). although the absolute activities measured with the mass spectrometry assay differed from
those measured with other types of enzyme assays, the
relative activities for affected patients vs heterozygotes
and healthy controls were generally similar to those
reported previously (15 ).

discussion
the quantification of accumulated metabolites in dbs by
tandem mass spectrometry can be used to detect up to
⬃30 genetic disorders in newborn-screening programs.
extending the analysis to the diagnosis of a subset of
lysosomal storage diseases is warranted given that effective therapies for such diseases are currently available or
in clinical development. on the basis of these criteria, we
have developed a high-throughput multiplex assay for
five lysosomal enzymes, abg, asm, gaa,  xxxg854xxx  and
gla, in dbs. previous studies have shown that these
enzymes are active in dbs (18, 23–25 ). this allows the
activities of these enzymes to be quantified by direct
enzyme assay.
mass spectrometric methods have been developed for
the detection of accumulated metabolites resulting from
fabry disease (26 ), gaucher disease (27 ), and krabbe
disease (28 ). these methods are sensitive and specific for
quantification of metabolites and are believed to be useful
in monitoring the effectiveness of therapeutic treatment.

however, the usefulness of these methods for newborn
screening is limited by the complicated pretreatment
steps required before mass spectrometry, with a different
procedure needed for each metabolite analyzed. in addition, the authors of these published studies state that the
methods are not recommended for diagnostic purposes.
the method described in the present study leads to
unambiguous quantification of lysosomal enzymes because enzyme activity is measured directly. furthermore,
the data obtained to date suggest that the method is
reliable for newborn screening for these five lysosomal
enzyme deficiencies.
conventional methods of quantifying enzymatic activity, such as spectrophotometry and fluorometry, have the
limitations of nonspecificity and limited capacity for multiplexing. in addition, the incorporation of a chromophore
or fluorophore into the substrate can give rise to falsenegative results. for example, the use of an unnatural
spectrophotometric substrate for assaying asm has recently been shown to be problematic in that a mutant
form of this enzyme shows normal activity on the artificial substrate but low activity on the naturally occurring
sphingomyelin substrate (29 ). quantification of enzymatic activity by tandem mass spectrometry is specific
(the product is unambiguously identified and quantified),
does not require substrate labeling, and is naturally
multiplexable as long as the detected analytes and their
cid fragments can be distinguished by their mass-tocharge ratios, which is typically the case. as shown in this
work, the detection of five lysosomal enzymes that are
traditionally measured by different analytical methods
(18, 23, 24 ) can be achieved with a single analytical platform. the method described here, in which tandem mass
spectrometry is used to directly quantify enzymes in dbs,
should be generally applicable to almost any enzyme that
retains activity in a rehydrated dbs. the potential of this
method to assay other enzymes of significance to newborn screening is under active investigation.
the use of acarbose as an inhibitor to completely
suppress the activity of raag while retaining most of the
gaa activity represents a simple, inexpensive, and reliable method for diagnosis of  xxxg826xxx  in dbs.
considering the known costs for commercially available
reagents and supplies and using a conservative estimate
of the cost to manufacture those components of the
multiplex assay that are not currently commercially available, i.e., gaa-s, gaa-is, gla-s, and gla-is, we estimate an overall reagent and supply cost of $0.72 per
individual for all assay steps before tandem mass spectrometry (see table 3 of the online data supplement). this
cost is compatible with budgetary constraints of newbornscreening programs. the mass spectrometry costs are
difficult to estimate at this time. it is likely, but not yet
confirmed, that the sample derived from the set of five
lysosomal enzyme assays can be infused into the mass
spectrometer together with the sample for amino acid and
 xxxd3156xxx  analysis. all of the species can be distin-

1795

clinical chemistry 50, no. 10, 2004

guished by multiple reaction monitoring, but it remains to
be seen whether components of the lysosomal enzyme
assay sample significantly suppress the ionization of the
amino acid and  xxxd3156xxx  derivatives.
in the present study we used the extract of a 5-mm dbs
to assay all five lysosomal enzymes or used a 2-mm dbs
for each of the five enzymatic reaction mixtures. the latter
method is more sensitive because enzymes are not quantitatively extracted from a dbs. given that the lowest
measured activities were for  xxxg854xxx , it might be best to use
a single 2-mm dbs to assay this enzyme and a 5-mm dbs
subjected to enzyme extraction to assay the other four
lysosomal enzymes. both punches can be obtained from
the same dbs (2-mm punch taken first from the center of
the dbs, followed by a 5-mm concentric punch to give a
“washer”-shaped punch). we have verified that this double-punch method gives assay results that are indistinguishable from those obtained from 2- and 5-mm punches
obtained from different dbs (not shown). these results
were obtained by extracting the 5-mm washer punch with
64 ␮l of universal extraction buffer (20 mmol/l sodium
phosphate, ph 7.0) and using 10-␮l aliquots for the abg,
asm, gaa, and gla assays.
the sample preparation steps before tandem mass
spectrometry are simple liquid transfers using microtiter
plate reaction vessels. thus, all steps are amenable to
automation by use of programmable pipetting robotics.
however, manual manipulation is perfectly acceptable
using a handheld, multichannel pipettor, especially when
fewer than ⬃500 patient dbs are analyzed per day (the
typical load of a statewide newborn-screening laboratory
in the united states). as summarized in table 1 of the
online data supplement, 1.3 min of sample infusion time
is needed to quantify the five lysosomal enzymes by use
of a sciex api-iii plus triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. currently available tandem mass spectrometers are
expected to produce a 4-fold or higher increase in ion
current, which is anticipated to reduce the sample infusion time by at least 16-fold.
the gaa and gla assays make use of internal standards that are chemically identical but isotopically distinguishable from the enzymatically generated products,
whereas the abg, asm, and  xxxg854xxx  assays make use of
internal standards that are close in structure to the products but not chemically identical. thus, calibration curves
of the type shown in fig. 1 of the online data supplement
derived from mass spectrometric analysis of standard
solutions of product and internal standard are required
for these latter three assays. the calibration curves
showed a good linear behavior with predicted product/
internal standard concentration ratios within ⫾0.049 –
0.066 of the actual measured ratios. the largest relative
errors are expected at very low product/internal standard
concentration ratios, corresponding to dbs from affected
patients. considering the generally very good linearity of
the product/internal standard concentration ratios from
the mass spectrometric data, calibration with two prod-

uct/internal standard mixtures should be sufficient in
day-to-day measurements. the internal standard concentration should be adjusted to be equal to the mean of
product concentrations based on assays of healthy individuals. the calibration mixtures should be measured at
product/internal standard concentration ratios of 1 (corresponding to the mean of the healthy population) and 0.5
(as an approximate midpoint of the heterozygous population). the two-point calibration should be performed
before and after each analytical run of multiple samples,
e.g., from a 96-well plate.
although the detection rate for affected patients was
100% in the current study, additional analyses with a
larger number of dbs are in progress to further evaluate
our method. we are also exploring the conversion of our
assay to high throughput (hundreds of samples analyzed
per day) as well as other issues such as the number of
blank samples analyzed per multiwell plate of patient
samples. it should also be mentioned that in cases of
abnormal or nondiscriminative results obtained with a
dbs, a blood sample for lymphocyte isolation or a fibroblast skin culture should be requested for confirmation of
the enzyme deficiency.
