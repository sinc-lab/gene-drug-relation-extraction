abstract low-voltage-activated (t-type) calcium channels play a role in diverse physiological responses including
neuronal burst firing, hormone secretion, and cell growth.
to better understand the biological role and therapeutic
potential of the target, a number of structurally diverse
antagonists have been identified. multiple drug interaction
sites have been identified for l-type calcium channels,
suggesting a similar possibility exists for the structurally
related t-type channels. here, we radiolabel a novel amide
t-type calcium channel antagonist (tta-a1) and show
that several known antagonists, including  xxxd2638xxx ,
 xxxd2125xxx , and  xxxd2956xxx , displace binding in a concentration-dependent manner. further, we identify a novel

quinazolinone t-type antagonist (tta-q4) that enhanced
amide radioligand binding, increased affinity in a saturable
manner and slowed dissociation. functional evaluation
showed these compounds to be state-dependent antagonists
which show a positive allosteric interaction. consistent with
slowing dissociation, the duration of efficacy was prolonged
when compounds were co-administered to wag/rij rats, a
genetic model of absence epilepsy. the development of a
t-type calcium channel radioligand has been used to demonstrate structurally distinct ttas interact at allosteric sites
and to confirm the potential for synergistic inhibition of
t-type calcium channels with structurally diverse antagonists.

introduction
low-voltage-activated (t-type) calcium channels have
been proposed to modulate physiological and pathophysiological processes as diverse as epilepsy [1–4], hormone
secretion [5, 6], and cell division [7–10]. these channels
therefore represent a potential therapeutic target for diseases as disparate as cancer [7], neuropathic pain [11–14],
obesity [15], and thalamocortical dysrhythmias such as
absence epilepsy, insomnia, obsessive compulsive disorder,
schizophrenia, and tinnitus [16]. this has led to numerous
efforts to identify potent and selective antagonists of these
channels [15, 17–22].
although low-voltage-activated calcium channels have
limited amino acid homology to the high-voltage-activated
calcium channel families, which include l-type channels, all voltage-gated calcium channels are structurally

82

related [23]. structurally diverse l-type calcium channel
antagonists have been shown to interact at distinct sites on
the channel [24–26] which can interact with one another
allosterically [25, 26]. these compounds have therapeutic
applications for cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension, with
different structural classes preferentially being used for
different indications. for example, later generation dihydropyridines are commonly used as antihypertensives,
whereas benzothiazepines and phenylalkylamines are typically used to treat cardiac arrhythmias [27–30]. these
distinct electrophysiological properties and therapeutic
applications may result from site-specific effects. because
t- and l-type calcium channels are structurally related, it
is reasonable to expect the diverse t-type antagonists
(ttas) identified thus far would similarly have multiple
potential sites of interaction and perhaps distinct electrophysiological and therapeutic effects. it is also reasonable
to anticipate some of these interactions would be allosterically coupled.
further, if compounds acting at allosteric sites positively
influence each other, it is theoretically possible to reduce
undesired off-target effects by using a combination of
lower doses of synergistic compounds [31]. therefore, a
better understanding of whether structurally diverse ttas
interact at distinct sites on the channel may lead to therapeutic strategies more appropriate for specific diseases, or
an improved therapeutic window.
a number of groups have pursued the development of
novel small molecule antagonists of the t-type calcium
channel by either rational design [32–34] or unbiased
library screening [15, 17–19], and these efforts have
identified a wide variety of compounds ranging from analogs of  xxxd2638xxx ,  xxxd2125xxx , and indomethacin to structurally novel compounds as summarized in recent reviews
[20–22]. all of these compounds have been confirmed
through functional assays whether by voltage clamp, calcium flux, or cell proliferation assays.
however, unlike for the l-type calcium channel,
radioligands have not been available to more directly
explore whether these compounds interact at distinct
sites on the t-type channel, and no studies have been
reported evaluating whether the binding sites of known
compounds are allosterically coupled. we have therefore
used an unbiased high throughput functional screen to
identify novel, potent, small molecule, and state-dependent antagonists of the t-type calcium channel. incorporating a radiolabel enabled the identification of a
structural series which interacts at a distinct site on the
channel with the potential for positive allosteric interactions. the positive allosteric interaction was confirmed in
functional in vitro assays as well as in an animal model
of absence epilepsy.

materials and methods
materials
[3h]-tta-a1 (56–65 mci/mmol),  xxxd2638xxx , and all
‘‘tta’’ compounds were synthesized at merck (west point,
pa).  xxxd2956xxx ,  xxxd2125xxx ,  xxxd2056xxx ,  xxxd3564xxx ,
trazodone, topiramate, nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil
were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo, usa).
cell culture
a ‘depolarized’ cell line was created by stable transfection
of pcdna4/to (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) containing  xxxg309xxx  (similar to genbank af211189 with
i1005v) into tetracycline inducible t-rex tm-hek 293
cells (invitrogen) using fugene 6 (roche molecular systems, pleasanton, ca, usa). a ‘hyperpolarized’ line was
created by transfecting human kir2.3 (genbank u07364)
subcloned into pcdna3.1neo (invitrogen) into the depolarized line as above [17]. both cell lines were grown in
5% co2 at 37°c.
depolarized fluorometric imaging plate reader assay
cells were plated and grown overnight in media supplemented with 0.5 lg/ml tetracycline to induce channel
expression. the following day, cells were washed in hanks
 xxxd2988xxx  (hbss) containing 0.05 mm ca2?,
20 mm hepes, and 250 lm probenecid. fluo4 (2.5 lm),
pluronic f-127 (0.0025%), tr40 (0.8 mm), bsa (0.1%),
and various concentrations of compound were added such
that the final concentration of dmso was 0.5%. cells were
placed in a humidified incubator at 37°c and 5% co2 for
1 h. the plate was then placed in the fluorometric imaging
plate reader (flipr) instrument (molecular devices,
sunnyvale, ca, usa) where baseline fluorescence was
recorded, a stimulus of 2 mm ca2? was added and
recording continued. percent inhibition was calculated
relative to the baseline-subtracted signal derived from
wells containing only dmso. potency was determined as
the inflection point from a 4-parameter sigmoidal fit to the
data. values reported are mean ± standard deviation.
hyperpolarized flipr assay
cells were plated and grown overnight in media supplemented with 0.5 lg/ml tetracycline to induce calcium
channel expression. the media was left on the cells. the
dye loading solution was prepared in hbss such that the
concentrations during the 1-h incubation were as follows:
20 mm hepes, 250 lm probenecid, fluo4 (2.5 lm),

83

pluronic f-127 (0.0025%), tr40 (0.8 mm). various concentrations of compound were added such that the final
concentration of dmso was 0.5%. cells were placed in a
humidified incubator at 37°c and 5% co2 for 1 h. the plate
was then placed in the flipr where baseline fluorescence
was recorded, a stimulus of ?10 mm k? was added and
recording continued. percent inhibition was calculated relative to the baseline-subtracted signal derived from wells
containing only dmso. potency was determined as the
inflection point from a 4-parameter sigmoidal fit to the data.
values are plotted as mean ± standard deviation.

patch pipettes contained (in mm) 125 cscl, 10 tea-cl,
10 hepes, 8 nacl, 0.06 cacl2, 0.6 egta, 4 mg-atp, 0.3
gtp, ph were adjusted to 7.2 with csoh. extracellular
solution was based on tyrode solution (in mm): 130 nacl,
4 kcl, 30 glucose, 20 hepes, 1 mgcl2, 2 cacl2, ph
adjusted to 7.4 with naoh. baseline t-type calcium currents were elicited by depolarizing to -20 mv for 70 ms,
cycling every 15 s from a holding potential of -80 mv.
current clamp studies were performed using the perforated
patch technique with nysatin added to the internal solution
at a final concentration of 20–100 lg/ml [35].

direct comparison of the depolarized
and hyperpolarized cell lines

compound selectivity assessment

the two cell lines were assayed on the same day using the
same solutions and flipr protocols. after overnight
growth in induction media, cell plates were prepared as for
the depolarized assay above with washing in 0.05 mm
ca2?. two additions were made on the flipr: the first was
?2 mm ca2? stimulus, and the second was ?10 mm k?.
to enable direct comparison, baseline fluorescence was
subtracted from all points and traces were normalized relative to maximum fluorescence.
flipr functional assessment of synergy
for the depolarized assay, compounds were diluted in the
presence or absence of 3 nm of tta-a2 or 5 nm tta-q4
and assayed as above. for the hyperpolarized assay, compounds were diluted in the presence or absence of 123 nm
of tta-a2 or 30 nm tta-q4. concentrations of tta-a2
and tta-q4 were chosen to achieve approximately 20%
inhibition in the respective assays. titrations with and
without the second compound were assayed on the same
plate to minimize differences in dye loading and incubation
times. compounds were diluted and evaluated in triplicate
on three separate days.
electrophysiological verification
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on hek-293 cells
expressing human  xxxg309xxx  were performed at room temperature. currents were recorded using a heka epc-9 patchclamp amplifier. data were stored on a personal computer
equipped with acquisition software heka patchmaster and
analyzed using fitmaster (heka), igor pro 4.0 and
graphpad prism 4, and origin 7.0. patch pipettes were made
from borosilicate glass tubing (warner instruments, hamden, ct, usa), fire-polished, and had a resistance of
1–5 mx. series resistance was compensated, and the
capacitance artifact was canceled using amplifier’s built-in
circuitry. leak current was corrected with a p/4 protocol.

ttas were evaluated for functional potency against
 xxxg304xxx  ( xxxg346xxx .2, l-type),  xxxg302xxx  ( xxxg302xxx , p/qtype),  xxxg303xxx  ( xxxg303xxx , n-type), and cacna1e
(cav2.3, r-type) calcium channels as described previously
[36, 37].
cav2.x synergy protocol
compounds were evaluated for block of  xxxg302xxx ,  xxxg303xxx ,
and cav2.3 channels in a fluorescent calcium-influx assay
as described in [37]. in brief, calcium-influx assay was
measured with an flipr tetra instrument using cell lines
expressing each channel type, which had been loaded
with fluo-4. each cell line expressed kir2.3 channels in
addition to the calcium channels to allow control of
membrane potential by bath potassium concentration.
cells were incubated for 30 min with compounds in the
presence of elevated bath potassium concentration
(26 mm for  xxxg302xxx , 14 mm for  xxxg303xxx , and 14 mm or
12 mm for cav2.3) to assess block of both resting and
inactivated channel states. the bath potassium concentration used during compound incubation was adjusted to
produce 30–40% reduction of the peak calcium–influx
signal observed at 4 mm potassium due to partial inactivation of the channel population. calcium influx was
triggered by the addition of higher bath potassium concentrations (72 mm).
tta compounds were evaluated in a 10-point titration
format from 0.001 to 30 lm with quadruplicate replication
in each test plate. potential synergistic effects were evaluated by titrating tta-q4 in the presence of 1 lm ttaa2 or 10 lm tta-a2.
binding experiments
membranes were prepared from the depolarized and
parental t-rextm-hek 293 cell lines and protein concentration was determined using the bio-rad protein assay
(bio-rad, hercules, ca, usa).

84

all binding assays were performed with 12.5 lg protein
in 1 ml final volume in packard unifilter-96, gf/c plates
(packard, meriden, ct, usa) coated with 0.3% ethylene
imine polymer solution (sigma-aldrich). assay and wash
buffer contained 20 mm hepes, 125 mm nacl, and
5 mm kcl. incubations were performed at room temperature for 3 h unless otherwise stated. at the end of all
experiments, the reactions were aspirated and washed with
4°c buffer using a perkin-elmer 96-well filtermate harvester. the plates were dried before the addition of
microscint-20 (perkin-elmer life and analytic sciences,
shelton, ct, usa). remaining radioactivity was quantified on a perkin-elmer nxt hts top count.
total and non-specific bindings were determined in the
absence and presence of 200 nm of tta-a2, respectively.
compounds for the competition studies were serially
diluted threefold in dmso. the diluted compound was
added to the well and a mixture of membranes and 1 nm
[h3]-tta-a1 was added and incubations performed as
described above. the co-operativity factor (a) and modulator dissociation constant (kb) were determined using the
‘allosteric modulator titration’ function of graphpad prism
v5.01. kinetic studies were terminated by adding tta-a2
to a final concentration of 1000 nm. the dissociation rate
constants were calculated and compared using the extra
sum of squares f test in graphpad prism v5.01.
wag/rij rat seizure model
all animal procedures were approved by, and conducted
according to the standards of, the merck institutional
animal care and use committee (iacuc).
adult male wistar albino glaxo rijswijk (wag/rij)
rats (*600 g) were implanted subcutaneously with radiotelemetric physiologic monitors (model: tl10m3f50-eee
or f40-eet; data sciences int., arden hills, mn, usa) to
record the electrocorticogram (ecog). animals were
housed individually in plastic cages and provided water
and food ad libitum. lights were on a 12:12 hour light/dark
cycle with lights off at 4:00 a.m. and on at 4:00 p.m.
signals were collected simultaneously from the animals
with dataquest a.r.t. 3.0/3.1 software (data sciences int.)
at 500 hz and stored on a pc for off-line analysis. following the completion of the data collection, all data were
scored using the automated seizure scoring software in
somnologica science (embla, ontario, canada). epileptiform activity was characterized as having a minimum
duration of 1 s, maximum duration of 1 min, minimum
threshold of 50 mv, standard deviation from background
of 3.5, and with a minimum of three consecutive spikes.
in a 2-day study design, rats (n = 4) were dosed by oral
gavage at 8:00 a.m. with 1 ml of vehicle [20%  xxxd3521xxx 
d-alpha-tocopheryl  xxxd2982xxx  1000 succinate

cell biochem biophys (2009) 55:81–93

(vite-tpgs)] on day 1. on day 2, rats were dosed at 8:00
a.m. with 1 ml of vehicle containing 0.3 mg/kg tta-a2
(n = 4), 1 mg/kg of tta-q4 (n = 4), or both. ecog
recordings were started just prior to compound administration and continued for 24 h each day. seizure duration
was calculated in 4 h bins starting at the time of dosing and
percent inhibition was calculated relative to the same time
from vehicle dosing on the previous day. to evaluate the
statistical significance of synergy in those time bins, a oneway anova model with factor treatment was set-up for
each time bin, followed by a comparison of means with
user-defined contrasts. the analysis was performed using
the statistical package r (v. 2.7.1) using the procedure glht
(simultaneous tests for general linear hypotheses) from
package multcomp, with one-sided contrasts evaluating the
difference between the treatment effect using both compounds and the sum of the treatment effects using individual compounds.
pharmacokinetics
male sprague–dawley rats, with jugular vein cannulation
for sample collection, received oral gavage doses of ttaa2 (1 mg/kg, n = 3), tta-q4 (5 mg/kg, n = 3), or both in
20% vite-tpgs (5 ml/kg). all animals were fasted overnight (*18 h) prior to dosing, and feeding was resumed 4 h
post-dose. blood was collected into tubes containing edta
at the selected time points. blood was centrifuged to obtain
plasma, and samples were stored frozen at -20°c prior to
analysis. samples were analyzed by lc-ms/ms for ttaa2 and tta-q4 following protein precipitation with acetonitrile under a validated analytical protocol.

results
ttas identification
the cell lines used in the depolarized assay express  xxxg309xxx 
under a tetracycline-inducible promoter to minimize the
detrimental effects of chronic calcium channel expression
on cell health and subsequent utility in downstream assays.
current clamp studies with the depolarized cell line
revealed a resting membrane potential of approximately
-20 mv, consistent with that typically observed in hek
293 cells. this would suggest the majority of channels
would be in the inactivated state and any ca2? flux
observable would be from the window current present due
to incomplete inactivation or a fraction of channels passing
through the open-state. some channels are indeed able to
pass calcium current under these depolarized conditions, as
shown by an increased signal upon increasing extracellular
[ca2?] (fig. 1).

data point

fig. 1 comparison of hyperpolarized and depolarized assays. depolarized (black line) and hyperpolarized (gray line) cell lines were
plated and grown overnight in the presence of tetracycline to induce
 xxxg309xxx  expression. cells were processed using the same solutions
(wash, dye load, 2 mm ca2? stimulus, and 10 mm k? stimulus).
fluorescence values from representative wells were baseline subtracted and normalized to peak values. the time of the calcium and
potassium stimulus additions are indicated by black and gray arrows,
respectively

because the depolarized flipr assay is run under
conditions where most channels are in the inactivated state,
it is likely the assay format will only accurately predict the
electrophysiological potencies of state-independent compounds. it is further expected this assay will overestimate
the potency of state-dependent compounds.
anticipating an assay measuring potency in the closed
state would more accurately predict potencies determined
by voltage-clamp, the inward rectifying  xxxg1232xxx 
kir2.3 was transfected into to the depolarized cell line to
generate a cell line with a hyperpolarized membrane
potential. under the conditions of physiological extracellular potassium, the preponderance of channels should be
in the closed state and therefore unresponsive to an
increase in extracellular calcium. if the majority of channels are indeed closed, a subsequent addition of potassium
would depolarize the cells and stimulate an influx of calcium as the channels enter the open state. based on this
prediction, approximately 300 clonal cell lines were
screened for both a lack of signal in response to a ca2?
addition and a signal in response to a subsequent addition
of k?. a cell line was selected which showed these characteristics over multiple passages. current clamp experiments confirm a hyperpolarized resting membrane
potential of approximately -60 mv.
to confirm the two cell lines contained t-type calcium
channels in distinct proportions of closed versus inactivated-to-open states, a side-by-side comparison was run
using a single preparation of solutions (wash, dye, ca2?
stimulus, and k? stimulus). baseline fluorescence was
subtracted from all points and the time-course of the
recorded flipr signals from representative wells was
normalized to the peak in the respective cell line (fig. 1).

a response to the addition of 2 mm ca2? is only observed
in the depolarized cell line and the k? addition stimulates
signal only in the hyperpolarized cell line.
these high throughput assays were used in medicinal
chemistry efforts to optimize the functional potency of
distinct structural series of ttas. these efforts resulted in
the identification of an indole tta-i1 [19], the piperidines
tta-p1 [18] and tta-p2 [17], the amides tta-a1 and
tta-a2 [15, 38] as well as the quinazolinones tta-q1
through -q4 [39]. the concentration–response curves for
select compounds in depolarized and hyperpolarized
flipr assays are depicted in fig. 2, and are summarized in
table 1. the indole and piperidines are state-independent
antagonists with similar potencies in the depolarized and
hyperpolarized assays, whereas the amides and quinazolinones are state-dependent antagonists with greater potencies in the depolarized assay (table 1). the structures
of these and other compounds with tta properties are
shown in fig. 3.
the selectivity of these novel ttas was assessed in
functional assays using the high-voltage-activated calcium
channels  xxxg302xxx  (p/q-type),  xxxg303xxx  (n-type), and cav2.3
(r-type) channels [37]. no activity was observed with

showed ic50 values of 7800 and 5400 nm, respectively, for
cav2.3. the other tta compounds were inactive at concentrations up to 10000 nm. tta-a2 and tta-q4 were
further evaluated for the ability to inhibit  xxxg346xxx .2 (l-type)
function and showed potencies of [10000 and 8000 nm,
respectively [36].

properties including  xxxd2056xxx ,  xxxd3564xxx , trazodone,
and topiramate did not inhibit binding at the maximum
concentration tested (10000 nm). evaluation of representatives of the three main classes of l-type antagonists
(nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil) also resulted in no
concentration-dependent inhibition of ligand binding at
concentrations up to 10000 nm.
quinazolinone ttas bind at a distinct site

[3h]-tta-a1 binding
three tritium atoms were incorporated at the methoxy
position of tta-a1 to form a potential t-type calcium
channel radioligand. incubation of increasing concentrations of [3h]-tta-a1 with membranes prepared from
hek 293 cells induced to express  xxxg309xxx  yielded displaceable tta-a1 binding that was saturable with a bmax
of 14078 fmol/mg protein and a kd of 1.8 nm (fig. 4).
non-specific binding (in the presence of 200 nm tta-a2)
was less than 10% of total binding at concentrations up to
15 nm. to further confirm the specificity of the observed
binding, similar experiments were performed with membranes prepared from parental hek 293 cells. as shown in
fig. 4, no concentration-dependent-specific binding was
detected in the absence of channel protein, indicating the
observed tta-a1 binding is specific to the expressed
 xxxg309xxx  channel protein.
a number of previously reported ttas were then
evaluated in displacement studies. as shown in fig. 5,
 xxxd2638xxx ,  xxxd2956xxx ,  xxxd2125xxx , tta-a1, tta-a2,
tta-p1, tta-p2, and tta-i1 all displaced [3h]-tta-a1
binding in a concentration-dependent manner with ki’s
reported in table 1. several other compounds with tta

a novel series of quinazolinone ttas was also evaluated
for their ability to displace the amide [3h]-tta-a1. the
quinazolinones either showed no displacement (tta-q1)
or increased radioligand binding in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 5), suggesting these compounds interact
at a distinct site with structure-specific potential for positive
allosteric interactions.
the observed increase in binding at a single concentration of radioligand can result from an increase in
apparent receptor number (bmax), or from a shift in the
affinity (kd), or both. saturation binding of [3h]-tta-a1
in the presence of increasing concentrations of tta-q4
resulted in a concentration-dependent leftward shift in the
kd and a small but significant increase in bmax (p \ 0.01,
2-tailed student’s t-test) (fig. 6a). these changes were
saturable such that the effects of 10 and 100 nm tta-q4
were similar, with 100 nm resulting in a 15% increase in
bmax and a 2.5-fold decrease in kd from 1.9 to 0.76 nm.
the cooperativity factor (a) was determined to be 3.3 and
the kb for tta-q4 was 1.2 nm.
the binding to allosteric sites can be confirmed if the
dissociation kinetics is altered in the presence of the second
compound [31]. as shown in fig. 6b, the dissociation rate

fig. 4 saturation curve of [h3]-tta-a1. membranes prepared from
parental hek-293 cells (5) and from the depolarized line induced to
express  xxxg309xxx  protein (d) were used to determine the affinity and
saturability of [h3]-tta-a1 binding. non-specific binding was
determined in the presence of 200 nm of tta-a2. specific binding
from an average of six wells is shown

is significantly slower in the presence of 100 nm tta-q4
from 0.376 to 0.054 min-1 [p \ 0.0001, f( xxxd487xxx , dfd) =
103.4 (1.57)]. together these results demonstrate that
tta-q4 allosterically modulates tta-a1 binding,
enhancing affinity, and slowing dissociation.

to determine whether this enhancement of binding and shift
of kd is relevant to channel function, test compounds were
evaluated in depolarized and hyperpolarized assays in the
absence or presence of tta-a2 and tta-q4 at concentrations that inhibited approximately 20% of the signal. this
concentration was chosen to balance the need to confirm the
presence and integrity of compound and to allow sufficient
signal window to detect further inhibition of the channel.
as shown in fig. 7 and table 2, no shift in potency was
observed in the depolarized assay for any of the compounds tested. because the amide and quinazolinone series
both tend to be state-dependent antagonists, we hypothesized the synergism was a function of stabilizing the high
affinity inactivated state. the hek 293 cells in the depolarized assay rest near -20 mv, such that the channels may
already be maximally inactivated. if this were the case, the
opportunity to see synergistic functional block with this
assay may be limited.

synergistic effects were therefore also evaluated in the
hyperpolarized assay, where the extent of channel inactivation is minimized. indeed, the hyperpolarized assay
revealed up to a 45-fold enhancement of potency that was
selective for the amide–quinazolinone interaction (fig. 8,
table 2). the potency of the piperidine tta-p1 was not
altered by the presence of either amide or quinazolinone
compounds.
to confirm the functional allosteric interactions by
standard methods, whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments
were performed at a holding potential of -80 mv. exposure to 10 nm tta-a2 and 30 nm tta-q4 individually
resulted in \8% inhibition of  xxxg309xxx  current, and simultaneous exposure to both 10 nm tta-a2 and 30 nm
tta-q4 resulted in 68% inhibition (fig. 9). this confirms
synergistic inhibition of t-type channel function and validates the predictive utility of the high throughput hyperpolarized assay for detecting positive allosteric interactions
of t-type calcium channel antagonists.

it is possible the amide and quinazolinone compounds
may weakly inhibit the high-voltage-activated calcium
channels. because of the structural similarities of these
channels, the sites may be similarly allosterically coupled
which could then result in detectable inhibition if both
compounds were presented. therefore, tta-q4 was
evaluated in the presence of 1 or 10 lm tta-a2 in
similar experiments using cell lines expressing  xxxg302xxx ,
2.2, and 2.3. the compounds tested alone were inactive or
exhibited ic50 values [5000 nm for the block of each
channel type. the addition of tta-a2 did not measurably change tta-q4-mediated inhibition of cav2 channels. these data suggest these compounds do not exhibit
the same synergistic interaction for the block of cav2
channels as were observed for the block of t-type calcium channels.

calcium channels, an in vivo model was selected for which
t-type calcium channels have been hypothesized to play a
pathological role: the wag/rij rat genetic model of
absence epilepsy [40, 41].
dose–response curves were performed to identify doses
of tta-a2 (0.3 mg/kg) and tta-q4 (1.0 mg/kg), which
resulted in approximately 30% inhibition of time in seizure
over a 4-h period (data not shown). these doses were then
evaluated alone or co-dosed. as shown in fig. 10,
co-dosing tta-a2 and tta-q4 did not greatly increase
the percent seizure inhibition from 1–4 h over either
compound dosed alone. in fact, the percent inhibition was
less than the sum of the two compounds dosed individually.
when compounds were dosed individually, there was
negligible inhibition of seizure activity from 4 to 8 or 8 to

12 h post-dose. in contrast, the animals receiving both
compounds showed significantly greater suppression of
seizure activity from hours 4–8 and 8–12 [p \ 0.05 (tvalue 1.8) and 0.01 (t-value 3.3), respectively].
this apparent prolongation of seizure suppression could
result from a decrease in the dissociation rate of the compounds from the receptors, as was seen in radioligand
dissociation studies. alternatively, it could result from an
interference of the pharmacokinetic clearance pathways.
therefore, compounds were dosed either individually or
together to determine whether their pharmacokinetic
properties were altered when co-dosed. no difference was
observed in the exposure profile of either compound when
administered in the presence or absence of the second
compound (fig. 11).

the pharmacology of l-type voltage-gated calcium channels has been extensively studied, and numerous drugs
targeting this channel have been developed with wideranging clinical applications. this detailed understanding
has been aided by the availability of potent and selective
antagonists as well as high affinity radioligands. in contrast, relatively little is known about the pharmacology of
the structurally related t-type voltage-gated calcium
channels, in part because neither radioligands nor potent

and selective compounds have been readily available.
while a number of groups have successfully identified
ttas, these have generally been structurally complex,
weak, or non-selective [20–22], and are therefore poor
candidates for radioligands.
to fill the need for improved pharmacological tools, we
developed cell lines which enabled high throughput
determination of potency and state-dependent properties
[15, 17–19]. the ‘depolarized assay’ determines potency
under conditions where most channels are in the inactivated
state and/or are in a state permissive of a window current.

this is supported by the observed -20 mv resting membrane potential, the ca2? influx in response to increased
extracellular calcium, and the lack of changes in fluorescent
signal kinetics in response to a depolarizing potassium
stimulus. the ‘hyperpolarized assay’ determines potency
on the closed state based on the functional definition of
a closed channel being able to conduct only upon

depolarization of the membrane potential. the resting
membrane potential of this cell line is near the foot of the
activation curve for t-type calcium channels and is slightly
more depolarized than the cell line developed by xie et al.
[42] using  xxxg307xxx  and  xxxg1256xxx . this difference may be due
to the different inactivation properties of the t-type channels used or a difference in the balance of steady-state
calcium window current and potassium conductances which
determine the resting membrane potential.
these assays were used to identify and optimize the
properties of two structural series of state-dependent small
molecule antagonists, the amides tta-a1 and tta-a2
and the quinazolinones tta-q1 thru -q4. three tritium
atoms were incorporated into the methoxy group of ttaa1 to create a high affinity t-type radioligand which
selectively binds to membranes prepared from hek 293
cells expressing  xxxg309xxx , but not to membranes prepared
from parental cells.
while several ttas displaced the amide radioligand,
others did not. this may be due to an insufficient concentration of competitor compound, or to the compounds
interacting with the channel at a distinct site without an
allosteric impact on radioligand binding. another possibility is that potencies determined using binding assays do
not always correlate with functional assays. the quinazolinone series was found to have structure-dependent
effects on amide binding, with some molecules not
affecting binding and others increasing binding to a variable extent. this suggests the molecules bind at distinct
sites with a potential for a positive allosteric interaction
that is dependent on the specific molecule and not strictly a
function of the binding site. the allosteric interaction was
confirmed through the observation of a saturable shift in
affinity with increasing concentrations of tta-q4 as well
as a decrease in the dissociation rate of radioligand.
this demonstration of multiple sites of interaction may
have implications for in silico attempts to identify novel
ttas. one recently employed strategy searched for compounds that shared structural characteristics common to
known tta compounds [32, 34]. an assumption inherent
in this strategy is that the molecules all interact at the same
site. although our data do not impact the validity of this
assumption for the molecules used in those efforts, it
underscores the need to consider alternative sites of compound interactions for this approach.
while the allosteric interaction described here was
identified using a radioligand and relatively low throughput
methods, we have demonstrated the potential for using high
throughput functional screens to identify ion channel
antagonists which interact in a positive allosteric manner.
this could have applications if it is later determined that
adverse events are associated with compounds interacting
at a particular site, similar to the pro-arrhythmic potential

92

of benzothiazepine and phenylalkylamine l-type antagonists. it is also expected that negative allosteric compounds
could be identified with a modified high throughput
screening strategy.
it is interesting to note that the binding assay detected
synergistic interactions, whereas the depolarized functional
assay did not. it is presumed that the membrane preparation
procedure eliminates any significant membrane potential
across the vesicle wall, and therefore the channels would
preferentially occupy the inactivated state. nonetheless, the
membrane preparation is able to detect a tta-q4-induced
shift in kd as well as an increase in bmax. the increase in
bmax suggests a fraction of the channels do not fully occupy
the high affinity inactivated state, even at nearly 0 mv.
this would suggest the depolarized functional assay, with a
resting membrane potential of -20 mv, should be able to
detect the synergistic interaction of tta-a2 and tta-q4.
however, there is no apparent leftward shift in the potency
curves using the depolarized assay. one possible explanation for this apparent conflict is that the ability of the
functional assay to accurately reflect the potency of very
high affinity compounds is limited by a ‘floor effect.’
nevertheless, the hyperpolarized functional assay readily
detected the interaction, and resulted in a far greater shift in
potency relative to that observed in the binding assay (45fold vs. 2.5-fold). similarly, electrophysiology studies
confirmed the synergy observed in binding and hyperpolarized assays.
t-type channels have been proposed to play a pathological role in absence epilepsy [1, 40, 41, 43, 44]. recent
studies have demonstrated potent and selective state-independent ttas (tta-p1 and tta-p2) suppress seizure time
in the wag/rij rat genetic model of this disorder [17, 18].
here, we show that the structurally distinct state-dependent
compounds tta-a2 and tta-q4 each independently
suppress seizure activity. this suggests the inactivated state
of the t-type channel is the relevant therapeutic target for
this disease model and confirms the therapeutic potential of
potent and selective ttas for absence epilepsy.
an interesting parallel can then be drawn between the in
vitro and in vivo synergy results. in the depolarized flipr
assay, little functional synergy is observed. similarly, no
increase in acute efficacy was observed in the co-dosing
experiments. a slowing of dissociation is observed with the
radioligand, and the duration of seizure suppression is
prolonged without alteration of the clearance of the compounds in vivo. this raises the possibility the in vitro
effects are not an artifact of depolarized assay limitations
and are indeed predictive of in vivo effects.
the use of an unbiased high throughput screening
technology (flipr) has led to the identification of two
structural series of state-dependent small molecule ttas.
from this effort, the first radioligand for t-type calcium

cell biochem biophys (2009) 55:81–93

channels has been identified and used to demonstrate that
structurally diverse classes of ttas interact at distinct sites
on the channel in a positive allosteric manner. the efficacy
of these state-dependent compounds in an animal model of
absence epilepsy clarifies the relevant therapeutic target
state of the channel for treatment of this disorder. overall,
these compounds represent valuable tools for extending the
understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological
roles of t-type calcium channels.
