fetal liver  xxxg2198xxx  3 internal tandem duplication ( xxxg801xxx  itd) mutations are
the most common molecular abnormality
associated with adult acute myeloid leukemia (aml). to exploit this molecular target, a number of potent and specific  xxxg801xxx 
kinase inhibitors have been developed
and are currently being tested in early
phase clinical trials of patients with refractory aml. to explore the efficacy of combining a  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor with standard aml
chemotherapy drugs, we tested the effect
of combining the  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3264xxx 

with  xxxd1790xxx  or  xxxd1816xxx  on the
proliferation and survival of cell lines
expressing either mutant ( xxxg801xxx  itd or
 xxxg801xxx  d835v) or wild-type (wt)  xxxg801xxx .
 xxxd3264xxx  had additive-to-synergistic inhibitory effects on  xxxg801xxx -dependent leukemic cell proliferation when combined with
 xxxd1790xxx  or  xxxd1816xxx . the synergistic interaction of  xxxd3264xxx  and the traditional antileukemic agents was more pronounced for induction of apoptosis.
 xxxd3264xxx  inhibited the proliferation of primary aml myeloblasts expressing mu-

tant  xxxg801xxx  itd but not wt  xxxg801xxx  protein.
combining  xxxd3264xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx  synergistically inhibited the proliferation of
primary aml myeloblasts expressing
 xxxg801xxx  itd but not wt  xxxg801xxx  protein. these
data suggest that the addition of potent
 xxxg801xxx  inhibitors such as  xxxd3264xxx  to aml
chemotherapy regimens could result in
improved treatment results. (blood. 2004;

introduction
acute myeloid leukemia (aml) remains a difficult disease to treat.
patients typically respond to initial treatment with anthracycline
and  xxxd1790xxx -based induction chemotherapy, but most patients
ultimately relapse and die of their disease. internal tandem
duplications (itds) of the juxtamembrane domain of the fetal liver
 xxxg2198xxx  3 ( xxxg801xxx ) receptor  xxxg2198xxx  are found in 20%
to 30% of cases of de novo aml.  xxxg801xxx  itd mutations are the most
common molecular abnormality associated with aml and presence of such a mutation predicts for a worse outcome for
patients,1-3 particularly those with a high mutant-to-normal  xxxg801xxx 
allelic ratio.4 an additional 5% to 7% of aml patients have an
activating mutation of the  xxxg801xxx  kinase activation loop.5
there is substantial experimental and clinical evidence to
support the hypothesis that  xxxg801xxx  mutations are important in the
initiation or maintenance of aml in some patients. activating
mutations of  xxxg801xxx  result in constitutive activation of  xxxg801xxx  tyrosine
kinase activity and can transform factor-dependent hematopoietic
cells as evidenced by conversion to factor-independent growth and
formation of tumors in immunodeficient mice.6-8 in addition,
retroviral transduction of primary murine bone marrow with an
aml patient–derived  xxxg801xxx  itd cdna results in a lethal myeloproliferative syndrome.9 finally, retroviral transduction of bone marrow derived from  xxxg1785xxx / xxxd3417xxx  receptor ␣
(pml-rar␣) transgenic mice with  xxxg801xxx  itd results in a marked

increase in the incidence of acute progranulocytic (apl)–like
leukemia in such mice when compared with mice that received a
transplant of mock-transduced bone marrow.10
these findings suggest that  xxxg801xxx  may be a target for molecular
therapy, analogous to that of bcr-abl in chronic myeloid
leukemia (cml). in cml, the use of single-agent imatinib
(sti571, gleevec) is associated with impressive response rates and
is now considered the standard frontline nontransplantation medical therapy.11,12 agents capable of inhibiting  xxxg801xxx  kinase have
been developed and display promising preclinical activity.13-19
these agents are capable of halting leukemic cell proliferation and
inducing apoptosis in vitro and in different animal models. several
of these  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors are currently being studied in phase-1 and
-2 clinical trials of patients with aml but thus far have demonstrated only modest single-agent activity.20-22 these results are
somewhat analogous to those seen using imatinib to treat patients
with cml blast crisis, where the rate of complete hematologic or
cytogenetic response, as well as the duration of such responses,
were markedly inferior to the results obtained in treating chronicphase patients. this experience suggests that  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors may
need to be combined with other antileukemic treatments to obtain
the best clinical results. theoretically, it would be advantageous to
add chemotherapy agents that act synergistically with  xxxg801xxx

inhibitors for antileukemic effect. ideally, such agents should not
have similar or overlapping toxicities.
we sought to profile the activity of a  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor in
combination with traditional antileukemic agents. for our studies
we selected  xxxd3264xxx , a small-molecule  xxxg801xxx  kinase inhibitor with
potent effects in vivo and in vitro.17 this agent was studied in
combination with  xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd1816xxx , current cornerstones of therapy for patients with aml.23  xxxd3264xxx  was found to
have additive-to-synergistic effects in inhibiting  xxxg801xxx  itd leukemia cell proliferation when combined with the traditional cytotoxic
agents. similar results were obtained using cells that were dependent upon either  xxxg801xxx  ligand (fl) activation of wild-type (wt)
 xxxg801xxx  or the kinase activity of a  xxxg801xxx  activation loop mutant
isoform ( xxxg801xxx  d835v). a stronger synergistic effect of combining
 xxxd3264xxx  with single-agent chemotherapy was seen when cellular
death (apoptosis) was the experimental end point.  xxxd3264xxx 
significantly inhibited the proliferation of  xxxg801xxx  itd–positive
primary aml myeloblasts and the combination of  xxxd3264xxx  and
 xxxd1790xxx  had a greater antiproliferative effect than either agent
used alone. in contrast,  xxxd3264xxx  had minimal activity against
primary aml myeloblasts expressing wt  xxxg801xxx  and the antiproliferative effects of a combination of  xxxd3264xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx  were
not significantly different than that seen using  xxxd1790xxx  as single
agent. our findings suggest that combining a  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor such
as  xxxd3264xxx  with standard antileukemia chemotherapy may improve clinical outcomes in aml.

patients, materials, and methods
cell culture
mv4-11 and baf3 cell lines were obtained through the american type
culture collection (atcc, manassas, va) and the molm14 cell line was
acquired through the fujisaki cell center (okayama, japan). wild-type
baf3 cells were grown in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (fbs) and 10% wehi-3b supernatant. molm14 cells were maintained
in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fbs. mv4-11 cells were maintained in
rmpi 1640 supplemented with 10% fbs. mv4-11 cells are hemizygous for an
itd of amino acids vdfreyeydh at position 592-601,16 whereas molm14
cells (sister cell line to molm 13) are heterozygous for an itd of dfreye at
amino acid position 593-598.24 the cdna for human  xxxg801xxx  was cloned into the
plxsn retroviral vector.25 mutations encoding for a  xxxg801xxx  itd (reduplication of
yeydlk at amino acid positions 597-602)16 and d835v were produced by
site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by bidirectional sequencing. retroviral
packaging cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wt, itd, or d835v
 xxxg801xxx  and retroviral supernatants were used to transduce baf3 cells.26 cells were
selected for factor-independent growth (itd  xxxg801xxx  or d835v) or fl-dependent
growth (wt  xxxg801xxx ), as previously described.16 wt  xxxg801xxx  baf3 cells were
maintained in rpmi 1640 ⫹ 10% fetal calf serum (fcs) supplemented with 5
ng/ml of recombinant human fl (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn). factorindependent baf3 itd  xxxg801xxx  and baf3 d835v cells were maintained in rpmi
1640 supplemented with 10% fbs.
reagents
the indolinone compounds su6668 and  xxxd3264xxx  were obtained from
sugen (south san francisco, ca), dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx 
(dmso) to create 10-mm stock solutions, and kept frozen at ⫺20°c.
su14816 (imatinib, sti571) was also obtained from sugen, dissolved in
dmso to create a 10-mm stock solution, and kept frozen at ⫺20°c.
 xxxd1790xxx  (cytosine ␤-d-arabinofuranoside) and  xxxd1816xxx  hydrochloride were obtained from sigma (st louis, mo).
proliferation assays
cells were added to 96-well plates at densities of 50 000 cells/well for
mv4-11, 50 000 cell/well for molm14, and 20 000 cells/well for baf3-

derived cells. test compounds were added and proliferation was measured
at 72 hours using a 2,3-bis[2-methoxyl-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2htetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (xtt)–based assay (roche molecular biochemicals, indianapolis, in).27 in the experiments involving a combination
of  xxxd3264xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx  or  xxxd1816xxx , the 2 agents were added
simultaneously to the cells.
informed consent for the use of residual blood specimens remaining
after completion of clinical testing to determine  xxxg801xxx  itd status was given
by aml patients. the institutional review boards of both the oregon
health & science university and the portland va medical center approved
the studies involving patient specimens. informed consent was obtained in
accordance with the declaration of helsinki. samples were deidentified
prior to use in the in vitro experiments and the  xxxg801xxx  itd status of the
deidentified specimens was independently determined by denaturing highperformance liquid chromatography (d-hplc) and direct sequencing as
previously described.16 low-density mononuclear cells were isolated by
 xxxd3253xxx -hypaque density centrifugation and were plated in a 96-well plate in
the presence or absence of  xxxd3264xxx  and/or  xxxd1790xxx . the effect of
 xxxd3264xxx  and/or  xxxd1790xxx  on the proliferation of primary aml myeloblasts was determined after 72 to 96 hours of treatment using an xtt-based
assay. in the experiments involving a combination of  xxxd3264xxx  and
 xxxd1790xxx , the 2 agents were added simultaneously to the cells.
immunoblotting
mv4-11 cells (5 ⫻ 107) were grown in rpmi 1640 and 10% fbs for 24
hours in the presence of study drugs, pelleted, and lysed with 100 ␮l of
protein lysis buffer (50 mm tris [tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane], 150
mm nacl, 1% nonidet p–40 [np-40], 0.25%  xxxd1835xxx  with added
inhibitors: aprotinin,  xxxd502xxx  [ xxxd502xxx ],
leupeptin, pepstatin, sodium orthovanadate, and sodium pyruvate). apoptosis was assessed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against
cleaved poly– xxxd80xxx  (adp) ribose polymerase (parp; cell
signaling technology, beverly, ma) used at 1:1000 dilution and a
peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution
(biorad, hercules, ca).17
apoptosis assays
cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and incubated in
rpmi supplemented with 10% fcs. cells (1 ⫻ 106) were incubated with
test compounds for 48 hours. apoptosis was assessed using a fluorescein
isothiocyanate (fitc)–labeled  xxxg166xxx / xxxd3027xxx  assay (immunotech, marseille, france).27 in the experiments involving a combination of
 xxxd3264xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx  or  xxxd1816xxx , the 2 agents were added
simultaneously to the cells.
data analysis
results from experiments were analyzed using the median effect method of
chou and talalay28 (calcusyn software available from biosoft, cambridge,
united kingdom). individual agents were tested to determine the dose
required to inhibit proliferation of cells to 50% of untreated controls (ed50).
doses of 4 times, 2 times, 1 times, 0.5 times, and 0.25 times the ed50 were
then analyzed using the calcusyn software program to create isobolograms
and calculate combination indices (cis). the combination index was
calculated using the more stringent statistical assumption of mutually
nonexclusive modes of action. specifically, ci ⫽ d1/(dx)1 ⫹ d2/(dx)2 ⫹
(d1 ⫻ d2)/((dx)1 ⫻ (dx)2), where d1 is the dose of drug 1, d2 is the dose of
drug 2, and (dx)1 and (dx)2 represent the estimated dose of drug 1 and 2
alone, respectively, inhibiting x%. the ci provides a numeric description of
the effects of a combination treatment. specifically, a ci less than 1
indicates synergy, a ci ⫽ 1 indicates an additive effect, and a ci more than
1 indicates antagonism between the 2 agents.
for the experiments examining the effects of  xxxd3264xxx  ⫾  xxxd1790xxx  on
the proliferation of primary aml myeloblasts, an analysis of variance
factorial treatment design framework was used to examine differences in
inhibition of cellular proliferation based on 3 factors: aml  xxxg801xxx  genotype
( xxxg801xxx  itd vs  xxxg801xxx  wt);  xxxd3264xxx  concentration (0, 1, 10, 50, 100 nm);
and  xxxd1790xxx  concentration (0, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 nm).

effects of combinations of  xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx  on cellular
proliferation

we have previously reported that  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits  xxxg801xxx  kinase
activity in aml cell lines and selectively inhibits proliferation and
induces apoptosis in cell lines with a  xxxg801xxx  itd mutation.17
 xxxd1790xxx  is one of the most active chemotherapeutic agents for
the treatment of aml and it remains the backbone of induction and
consolidation regimens.23,29 to determine if inhibition of  xxxg801xxx 
kinase in aml cells might potentiate the effects of  xxxd1790xxx , we
performed experiments in which fixed doses of  xxxd3264xxx  were
added to increasing doses of  xxxd1790xxx  to test if a combination of
the agents would prove more effective than either agent used alone.
mv4-11 cells, known to be hemizygous for a  xxxg801xxx  itd mutation,16 were treated with 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2 ␮m of  xxxd1790xxx .

blood, 15 december 2004 䡠 volume 104, number 13

zero, 2, 4, or 8 nm  xxxd3264xxx  was then added at each dose of
 xxxd1790xxx . as shown in figure 1,  xxxd3264xxx  increased the inhibitory effects of  xxxd1790xxx  on cellular proliferation across the entire
dose range studied. it should be noted that 2 nm and 4 nm of
 xxxd3264xxx  as a single agent had minimal effects on the proliferation
of mv4-11 cells (4% and 8% inhibition of proliferation, respectively) and, similarly, single-agent  xxxd1790xxx  at the 0.25-␮m dose
only inhibited proliferation by 6%. the 8-nm dose of  xxxd3264xxx 
inhibited proliferation of mv4-11 cells by approximately 45%,
consistent with our previous report.17 notably, combining 0.25 ␮m
 xxxd1790xxx  with either 2 or 4 nm  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited cellular
proliferation by 19% and 34%, respectively.
for a more quantitative analysis of the apparent synergistic
interaction between  xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx , we performed fixedratio dilution experiments. the results from these experiments were
used to create isobolograms and calculate combination indices
(cis) for various levels of drug activity. three separate cell lines
with known juxtamembrane tandem duplications in  xxxg801xxx  were
used in our combination studies: molm14 cells (heterozygous for
an itd mutation), a baf3 cell line engineered to express human
 xxxg801xxx  with an itd mutation (baf3 itd  xxxg801xxx ), and mv4-11 cells
(hemizygous for an itd mutation). the different mutations of these
cell lines provide a spectrum of itd mutations and also reduce
potential bias from idiosyncrasies of any individual cell line. in
addition, we performed similar experiments using factor-independent baf3 d835v  xxxg801xxx  and fl-dependent baf3 wt  xxxg801xxx .
experiments were performed with each cell line to determine
the concentrations of  xxxd1790xxx  or  xxxd3264xxx  capable of decreasing proliferation to 50% of untreated control cells (ed50). as
noted previously, the ed50 for  xxxd3264xxx  inhibition of proliferation was significantly lower for cells expressing  xxxg801xxx  itd
compared with fl-activated wt  xxxg801xxx  or d835v. specifically,
the ed50 for inhibition of mv4-11, molm14, and baf3 itd
 xxxg801xxx  were 8 nm, 12 nm, and 8 nm, respectively (x-intercept
values in figure 2; table 1). in contrast, the ed50 values for
 xxxd3264xxx  inhibition of the proliferation of fl-activated wt
 xxxg801xxx – and factor-independent  xxxg801xxx  d835v–expressing cells
were 50 and 110 nm, respectively.

figure 2. isobolograms for the effects of  xxxd3264xxx 
and  xxxd1790xxx  on cellular proliferation. cells were
incubated with  xxxd1790xxx ,  xxxd3264xxx , or both for 72 hours
and proliferation was assessed using an xtt-based
assay. results were analyzed using calcusyn software
for (a) mv4-11, (b) molm14, (c) baf3 itd  xxxg801xxx , (d)
fl-stimulated baf3 wt  xxxg801xxx , and (e) baf3 d835v
 xxxg801xxx  cell lines (concentrations of agents are expressed
in nm). for 90% inhibition (ed90), the points fall to the left
of the predicted line of additive effect, suggesting a
synergistic interaction of  xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx . the
drugs appear to have an additive effect for doses necessary to inhibit proliferation at 50% of untreated control. f

ci values significantly less than 1 indicate synergy; values close to 1, an additive
effect; and values significantly greater than 1, an antagonistic effect of the 2 agents.

cells were treated with  xxxd1790xxx ,  xxxd3264xxx , or both agents at 4
times, 2 times, 1 times, 0.5 times, and 0.25 times the ed50. analysis
of the data using the method of chou and talalay28 produced
isobolograms for the 5 cell lines (figure 2; table 1). the simulated
isobolograms define a “dose of equivalence” for the agents.
experimental results that fall near the line suggest that combinations of the 2 agents have an additive effect. experimental results
falling to the left of the line indicate better-than-additive effects of
combining the agents (ie, synergy). experimental results that fall
far to the right of the line indicate that the 2 agents have
antagonistic effects. in our experiments, the observed effect for the
concentration of the 2 agents necessary to inhibit cells by 90%
(ed90) fell to the left of the line of dose equivalence for all 5 tested
cell lines. adding  xxxd3264xxx  at low nm doses markedly reduced the
amount of  xxxd1790xxx  necessary to achieve any given amount of
antiproliferative effect. ci values for the observed effects on
proliferation were also computed. for the experiments with the 5
cell lines, the ed90 ci was less than 1, suggesting a better-thanadditive effect of combining  xxxd3264xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx .
 xxxd3264xxx  is a multitargeted kinase inhibitor, with potent activity
against kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor a ( xxxg1709xxx ),
 xxxg1710xxx ,  xxxg801xxx ,  xxxg526xxx  1r ( xxxg525xxx ), and
 xxxg1274xxx  ( xxxg1274xxx ).17,30 to
confirm that the observed antiproliferative effects were solely due
to the activity of  xxxd3264xxx  against  xxxg801xxx  and not one or more other
 xxxd3264xxx -target kinases, we compared the effects of  xxxd3264xxx ,

figure 3. isobolograms for the effects of  xxxd1816xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx  on cellular proliferation. cells were

suggesting an additive effect for the combination  xxxd3264xxx 
and  xxxd1816xxx  on mv4-11 and molm14 cells. for the
3 baf3-derived cell lines, the combination results are
more clearly to the left of the lines of equivalence,
suggesting a synergistic effect. the ci values are listed in

different cell lines. su6668 inhibits kit,  xxxg1709xxx ,  xxxg1710xxx , and
 xxxg1274xxx  but not  xxxg801xxx ,31,32 whereas su14816 inhibits kit,
 xxxg1709xxx , and  xxxg1710xxx  but not  xxxg801xxx ,  xxxg525xxx , or  xxxg1274xxx .27,33
all 5 cell lines were inhibited by  xxxd3264xxx  but not by other potent
inhibitors targeting kit,  xxxg1709xxx ,  xxxg1710xxx , or  xxxg1274xxx 
(su14816 at 1000 nm, su6668 at 500-3000 nm; data not shown).
the effect of  xxxd3264xxx  on the proliferation of baf3-derived cell
lines expressing mutant or wt  xxxg801xxx  was completely abrogated
when  xxxg1177xxx  ( xxxg1177xxx ) was provided as alternative growth
factor. in addition,  xxxd3264xxx  in doses up to 3000 nm had no effect
on the proliferation of the parental baf3 cell line grown in the
presence of  xxxg1177xxx  (data not shown). based on these results, we
conclude that antiproliferative effects of  xxxd3264xxx  on the factorindependent growth of the mutant  xxxg801xxx  cell lines and the
fl-dependent growth of wt  xxxg801xxx  baf3 cell line used in our
experiments are mediated entirely by inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  kinase.
effects of combinations of  xxxd1816xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx  on
cellular proliferation

anthracyclines are another class of chemotherapeutic agents
commonly used in the treatment of aml.23 therefore, we performed experiments to determine the efficacy of the combination of
 xxxd3264xxx  and  xxxd1816xxx . the ed50 for  xxxd1816xxx  was
determined separately for each cell line. cells were then treated
with  xxxd1816xxx ,  xxxd3264xxx , or both agents at 4 times, 2 times, 1
times, 0.5 times, and 0.25 times the ed50.
all 5 of the cell lines were sensitive to  xxxd1816xxx  in a 10- to

effects of combinations of  xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx  on
induction of apoptosis

our xtt-based “proliferation” assays directly measure the number
of metabolically viable cells for each treatment condition. thus,
both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of the single agents and
combinations are reflected in the assay results. previous studies
have demonstrated that potent  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors are capable of
selectively inducing apoptosis in cell lines containing  xxxg801xxx  itd
mutations.13,15,17,19 since the combination of  xxxd3264xxx  with traditional cytotoxic agents increased the “antiproliferative” effects of
chemotherapy, we sought to determine whether the combination of
 xxxd3264xxx  with antileukemia chemotherapy drugs actually increased cell killing when compared with single-agent therapy.
mv4-11 cells were treated with single-agent  xxxd3264xxx  (25 nm or
50 nm) or single-agent  xxxd1790xxx  (2 ␮m or 4 ␮m). additionally,
cells were treated with combinations of these agents: 25 nm
 xxxd3264xxx  with either 2 ␮m or 4 ␮m  xxxd1790xxx . apoptosis was
assessed at 24 hours using immunoblotting for proteolytic cleavage
of poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp; figure 4).
 xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx  were both capable of inducing apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, as assessed by parp cleavage.
however the combination of the lowest doses of both agents (2 ␮m
 xxxd1790xxx  and 25 nm  xxxd3264xxx ) produced a greater effect than
those seen using twice the dose of either agent alone, suggesting a
synergistic interaction. the small amount of full-length parp
detectable after treatment with either agent alone was absent when
the agents were combined.
in order to more precisely evaluate synergy using a mathematical model, we used a more quantitative assessment of apoptosis in
our subsequent experiments. analysis of apoptosis with flow
cytometry using  xxxg166xxx –fitc and  xxxd3027xxx  provides a
convenient method to quantify apoptotic and/or nonviable cell
populations. for these experiments we used mv4-11, molm14,
and baf3 itd cells as models of the  xxxg801xxx  itd mutations
commonly found in aml. isobolograms from these experiments
demonstrate dramatic synergistic induction of apoptosis for combination of  xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx  (figure 5; table 3).
the ed90 experimental values for the combination of  xxxd3264xxx 
and  xxxd1790xxx  fall well to the left of the line of equivalence,
demonstrating a strong synergy between  xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx 
in inducing apoptosis. calculated ci values were less than 1 at
almost all dose effects for the 3 cell lines, indicating that a
combination of  xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx  had a much greater-thanadditive effect in inducing apoptosis of these leukemic cell lines.

similar to the apoptosis experiments with  xxxd1790xxx , cells were
treated with  xxxd1816xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx  either as individual agents
or in combination and then analyzed using a flow cytometry–based
assay. results were analyzed using the median effect method to
generate isobolograms and ci values (figure 6; table 4).
the actual experimental combination results for ed50, ed75,
and ed90 fell far to the left of the lines of equivalence. these results
indicate a strong synergistic interaction of  xxxd1816xxx  and
 xxxd3264xxx  in inducing apoptosis of these  xxxg801xxx  itd–positive cell
lines. ci values were less than one for all dose effects with greatest
impact at ed90, indicating potent synergy for the combination of
 xxxd3264xxx  with this traditional cytotoxic agent.
in vitro effects of  xxxd3264xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx  on primary human
aml cells

to further test whether our cell line model observations might be
relevant to the treatment of human aml, we isolated low-density
peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 5 patients with refractory
and/or multiply relapsed aml. the  xxxg801xxx  itd status of the 5
patients was determined by d-hplc and dna sequencing: 3
patients had unique  xxxg801xxx  itds (reyeydl595-601 after l601,
freyeydlkwefprenl594-610 after n609, yeydlkwefprenlef597-612 after f612, respectively) and 2 patients had no
mutation of the  xxxg801xxx  juxtamembrane or activation loop domains.16,34 low-density peripheral blood mononuclear cells were
cultured for 72 to 96 hours in the presence or absence of  xxxd3264xxx 
and/or  xxxd1790xxx . the effects of single-agent or combined treatment on cellular proliferation, as judged by an xtt-based assay,
are graphically depicted in figure 7.  xxxd3264xxx , at a concentration of
50 nm, significantly inhibited the proliferation of primary aml
cells with a mutant  xxxg801xxx  itd (p ⬍ .0001). in contrast, this dose of
 xxxd3264xxx  had no significant effect on the proliferation of primary
aml cells lacking any detectable  xxxg801xxx  mutation. the addition of
250 or 500 nm  xxxd1790xxx  to  xxxd3264xxx  significantly inhibited the
proliferation of  xxxg801xxx  itd aml cells compared with the effect of
 xxxd1790xxx  alone (p ⫽ .0085 and p ⫽ .0493, respectively). at
higher doses of  xxxd1790xxx , the addition of  xxxd3264xxx  did not
significantly further inhibit proliferation of aml cells with  xxxg801xxx 
itd. however, the small number of patient samples and the
near-maximal antiproliferative effects of the higher doses of
 xxxd1790xxx  may have obscured any additional effects of the
combination treatment. in contrast to the results obtained using
 xxxg801xxx  itd aml specimens, the addition of  xxxd3264xxx  at a concentration of 50 nm did not increase the antiproliferative effects of
 xxxd1790xxx  doses of 250 to 8000 nm on the proliferation of  xxxg801xxx 
wt aml cells. the limited numbers of aml cells obtained from
the patient samples precluded our ability to perform the multiple
fixed-ratio combinations of  xxxd3264xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx  required for

figure 4. combination of  xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx  on apoptosis. mv4-11 cells
cultured in the presence of  xxxd3264xxx ,  xxxd1790xxx , or both were analyzed for parp
cleavage by western blot after 24 hours of exposure to agents. representative
results from 1 of 3 experiments are displayed. increasing doses of either single agent
increased the amount of cleaved parp detected. the combination of agents
produced a dramatic increase in the cleavage product with almost no full-length
parp detected.

discussion
aml is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. patients
typically respond to initial treatment with anthracycline and
 xxxd1790xxx –based induction chemotherapy, but most
patients ultimately relapse and die of refractory disease. the
prognosis is worse in elderly patients who typically experience
substantially greater treatment-related toxicities with few durable
remissions and are rarely cured. in addition, the elderly are usually
not candidates for more intensive therapy using autologous or
allogeneic stem cell transplantation. although advances in supportive care have improved treatment-related mortality, the overall cure
rate in adult aml has not improved significantly in the last decade.
this plateau has lead to a search for newer therapies that might
target fundamental molecular abnormalities in aml cells.35-38
the recent success of imatinib in treating cml has fueled
enthusiasm for the further development of targeted therapies for
aml.11,12 logically, such therapies should be most efficacious if
the target is a critical molecular mechanism initiating or maintaining the leukemic state. although the weight of evidence suggests
that translocations involving transcriptional machinery are the
initiating event in many cases of aml, in most instances it is not
yet possible to effectively target these abnormalities.39 the lone
exception has been the development of  xxxd3417xxx 
(atra) therapy for the treatment of apl.40 new approaches to
selective inhibition of specific histone deacetylases and disruption
of pathologic transcription factor complexes are urgently needed.
in contrast, substantial progress has been made in the development
of specific  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors.
to date,  xxxg801xxx  mutations are one of the most attractive aml
targets yet identified, as these mutations are one of the most
common molecular abnormalities found in cases of aml.1-3 a
number of potent and selective  xxxg228xxx  inhibitors
have been developed and characterized in preclinical models.13-18,34
several of these  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors are being testing in ongoing
phase-1 and -2 trials for patients with refractory aml.20-23 in
preliminary reports, these inhibitors appear to have some activity as
single agents but to date responses have tended to be incomplete or
of limited duration. although not definitive, such studies suggest
the possibility that  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors may have only a limited role as
single-agent therapy, at least in patients with refractory or multiply
relapsed aml.
these results are consistent with proposed models of aml
leukemogenesis in which multiple different abnormalities are
hypothesized to be necessary to produce leukemia. existing
evidence suggests that hematopoietic stem or progenitor cell
expression of bcr-abl,41,42 ets variant gene 6 ( xxxg737xxx )– xxxg1710xxx 

( xxxg737xxx – xxxg1710xxx ),43-45 or fip1l1-pdgfra46 are sufficient to
induce a myeloproliferative disease in mice, consistent with these
abnormalities being the initiating molecular event in cml, chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia, and hypereosinophilic syndrome, respectively. in contrast,  xxxg801xxx  mutations appear to be a later event that
increases the proliferation of a preexisting neoplastic clone.39,47
the most successful application of molecularly targeted therapy
in aml to date has been the use of atra in the treatment of apl.
treatment of apl with atra as a single agent results in early
remission but unacceptably high relapse rates. however, the use of
atra in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic agents
produces the highest sustained remissions rate of any frenchamerican-british (fab) subtype of aml.40,48 this example suggests that the most effective use of targeted agents in aml may be
in combination with standard aml chemotherapy agents.
in our experiments we have shown the feasibility of combining
a  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd3264xxx , with standard aml chemotherapy
drugs.  xxxd3264xxx  increased the antiproliferative effects of  xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd1816xxx  on  xxxg801xxx  itd–containing cell lines. low
concentrations of this agent reduced the dose of cytotoxic agent
necessary to produce any given antiproliferative effect. more
importantly, adding  xxxd3264xxx  to cytotoxic agents resulted in strong
synergistic effects for the induction of apoptosis of the leukemic
cell lines. the ability of  xxxd3264xxx  to induce apoptosis in leukemia
cells when added to traditional chemotherapy drugs demonstrates
that these combinations are potently cytotoxic rather then merely
cytostatic.
we attempted to validate the potential clinical relevance of
these observations using cultured primary aml myeloblasts. in
these experiments,  xxxd3264xxx  significantly inhibited the proliferation of  xxxg801xxx  itd–positive aml myeloblasts and the combination
of  xxxd3264xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx  had a greater antiproliferative effect
than either agent used alone. in contrast,  xxxd3264xxx  had minimal
activity against primary aml myeloblasts expressing wt  xxxg801xxx ,
and the antiproliferative effects of a combination of  xxxd3264xxx  and
 xxxd1790xxx  were not significantly different than that seen using
 xxxd1790xxx  as single agent.
levis et al34 have recently reported that combining an alternative  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd2458xxx , with various chemotherapy agents
including  xxxd1790xxx  or anthracyclines synergistically induced cell
killing of  xxxg801xxx  itd–positive cells. in their experiments,  xxxd2458xxx 
synergized with chemotherapy if used simultaneously or immediately following exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy agents. in

contrast, pretreatment with cep-70 was generally antagonistic,
especially when used with  xxxd1790xxx .34 in our experiments,
 xxxd3264xxx  was used simultaneously with  xxxd1790xxx  or  xxxd1816xxx . overall, our results with  xxxd3264xxx  are consistent with the
results obtained using  xxxd2458xxx . taken together, these 2 studies
suggest that inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  kinase activity and not effects on
other drug targets (eg, kit) is responsible for the observed
synergistic proapoptotic effects when these inhibitors are used with
standard antileukemic chemotherapy drugs.
the major side effects of standard aml chemotherapy are mucositis,
cardiac toxicity–prolonged myelosuppression, bleeding, and infection.23
extensive testing of single-agent  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors in animals and limited
testing in humans does not indicate that these agents cause mucositis or
cardiac toxicity. in animal models, myelosuppression does not appear to
be a significant side effect of  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors. grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression in solid-tumor patients being treated with  xxxd3264xxx  was uncommon;
fatigue and hypertension were the dose-limiting toxicities of this agent.49-51
the effects of  xxxd3264xxx  on the blood counts of aml patients may be
more difficult to interpret as myelosuppression may result from suppression of the leukemic clone rather than an effect on normal hematopoietic
cells. however, it seems feasible that a combination of standard aml
chemotherapy agents and a  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor such as  xxxd3264xxx  could result
in increased clinical efficacy without necessarily increasing the toxicity of
either agent. based on our results, further clinical development of such an
approach seems warranted.
in addition to the possible use of full-dose chemotherapy
regimens in combination with  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors such as  xxxd3264xxx ,
our data also suggest another potential strategy to improve
outcomes in elderly patients with aml. due to the toxicities of
standard-intensity chemotherapy, many elderly patients are not
viewed as candidates for treatment with regimens capable of
inducing a complete remission and are instead treated with
supportive care only.35 our results suggest that the addition of a
 xxxg801xxx  inhibitor to a given chemotherapy regimen might allow a 2to 4-fold reduction in chemotherapy doses without impacting the
antileukemic effect. such dose reductions could increase the
proportion of elderly patients with aml who are candidates for
induction and/or consolidation treatments.
early-phase clinical studies to characterize the role of  xxxg801xxx 
inhibitors in aml are currently under way. it is hoped that these

treatments of aml, ultimately leading to more effective and less
