summary. topical capsaicin formulations are used for pain management. safety and modest
efficacy of low-concentration capsaicin formulations, which require repeated daily selfadministration, are supported by meta-analyses of numerous studies. a high-concentration
capsaicin 8% patch (qutenzatm ) was recently approved in the eu and usa. a single 60-min
application in patients with neuropathic pain produced effective pain relief for up to 12
weeks. advantages of the high-concentration  xxxd428xxx  include longer duration of
effect, patient compliance, and low risk for systemic effects or drug–drug interactions. the
mechanism of action of topical capsaicin has been ascribed to depletion of substance
p. however, experimental and clinical studies show that depletion of  xxxg2240xxx  from
nociceptors is only a correlate of capsaicin treatment and has little, if any, causative role in
pain relief. rather, topical capsaicin acts in the skin to attenuate cutaneous hypersensitivity
and reduce pain by a process best described as ‘defunctionalization’ of nociceptor fibres.
defunctionalization is due to a number of effects that include temporary loss of membrane
potential, inability to transport neurotrophic factors leading to altered phenotype, and
reversible retraction of epidermal and dermal nerve fibre terminals. peripheral neuropathic
hypersensitivity is mediated by diverse mechanisms, including altered expression of the
 xxxg2335xxx  trpv1 or other key ion channels in affected or intact adjacent peripheral
nociceptive nerve fibres, aberrant re-innervation, and collateral sprouting, all of which are
defunctionalized by topical capsaicin. evidence suggests that the utility of topical capsaicin
may extend beyond painful peripheral neuropathies.

topical capsaicin formulations are widely used to manage pain.
low-concentration creams, lotions, and patches intended for
daily skin application have been available in most countries
since the early 1980s. prescriptions are usually not needed
for these self-administered medicines, which often have not
been reviewed formally by drug regulatory authorities. the
recent approval in the eu and usa of a prescription-strength
high-concentration single-administration capsaicin 8% patch
(qutenzatm ) with a duration of action over many weeks
invites an examination of recent advances in the understanding of capsaicin’s mechanism and site of action.
in this review, which does not cover other naturally occurring or synthetic trpv1 agonists, we discuss the potential
utility of topically administered capsaicin for the management of pain in classical peripheral neuropathies and other
hypersensitivity disorders, some of which are currently

considered as idiopathic. furthermore, we seek to elucidate
the molecular and cellular basis of capsaicin treatment,
and clarify misunderstandings, particularly with respect to
the involvement of  xxxg2240xxx  depletion.

pain management with topical capsaicin
capsaicin has played an important role in folk medicine, often
on the basis of using like to treat like, for example, treating
burning pain with a substance which causes burning pain.1
the first formal report of the pain-reducing properties of
topical capsaicin in the west appeared in 1850 as a recommendation to use an alcoholic hot pepper extract on burning or
itching extremities.2 creams, lotions, and patches containing
capsaicin, generally in the range of 0.025–0.1% by weight,
are now sold in many countries, often without the requirement

topical capsaicin for pain management

capsaicin pharmacology
capsaicin is a highly selective and potent (low nanomolar affinity) exogenous agonist for the trpv1 receptor, a  xxxg1608xxx -ion channel complex which provides
integrated responses to temperature, ph, and endogenous
lipids.13 temperatures of 438c or higher or acidity of ph of
,6.0 can directly activate the channel, but combinations of
these two stimuli can activate the channel at substantially

lower temperatures or ph values. numerous putative
endogenous agonists for trpv1 have been identified; these
include anandamide, n-acyldopamines, other long-chain
unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx , and lipoxygenase compounds such
as leukotriene b4 and 12-(s) and 15-(s)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid.13 recently, oxidized metabolites of linoleic acid
have been added to the list of potential endogenous agonists.14 responsiveness of trpv1 receptors to these activators
is also highly regulated by the phosphorylation state of the
channel complex, the presence of ancillary proteins, and an
ever-growing array of putative allosteric modulators.15
when activated by a combination of heat, acidosis, or
endogenous/exogenous agonists, trpv1 may open transiently
and initiate depolarization mediated by the influx of sodium
and calcium ions. in the nociceptive sensory nerves which
selectively express trpv1 (mostly c- and some ad-fibres),
depolarization results in action potentials, which propagate
into the spinal cord and brain, and may be experienced as
warming, burning, stinging, or itching sensations (fig. 2).
in contrast to transient activation which follows normal
environmental stimuli or inflammatory responses to tissue
injury, activation of trpv1-expressing nerve fibres by
exposure to a chemically stable exogenous agonist, such as
capsaicin, can generate a biochemical signal with a persistent effect. the trpv1 channel is highly calcium permeable
(with a calcium:sodium permeability ratio that starts at
about 8:1 and increases to about 25:1 during prolonged capsaicin exposures),16 which allows significant amounts of

of a prescription, for the management of neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. clinical studies of these medications, usually
involving three to five topical skin applications per day for
periods of 2–6 weeks, have generally suggested modest
beneficial effects against various pain syndromes, including
post-herpetic neuralgia (phn), diabetic neuropathy, and
chronic musculoskeletal pain.3 4 since low-concentration,
capsaicin-based products often result in contamination of the
patient’s environment (clothing, bedding, contact lenses, etc.)
and each application may be associated with a burning
sensation, poor patient compliance with these products is
often cited as a likely contributor to limited efficacy.5
in an attempt to evaluate whether pain relief could be
achieved by a single exposure to a much higher concentration of topical capsaicin, 10 patients with intractable
pain syndromes were treated with a compounded highconcentration 5–10% w/w cream.6 patients were provided
regional anaesthesia for tolerability and airborne contamination of treatment rooms occurred. based on encouraging
results, a high-concentration capsaicin-containing (8%)
patch designated  xxxd428xxx  and then given the trade
name qutenzatm was developed and evaluated.7
the capsaicin 8% patch is designed to rapidly deliver capsaicin into the skin while minimizing unwanted systemic or
environmental exposure of capsaicin to patients and healthcare providers. phase 1 data suggested that a single 60-min
patch application was adequate to induce nociceptor defunctionalization, as measured by reversible reduction in
intra-epidermal nerve fibres (enfs), marked by the structural
nerve marker protein gene product (pgp) 9.5 immunostaining,
and small, reversible alterations in cutaneous nociceptor
function.8 9 phase 3 studies demonstrated efficacy against
phn10 11 (fig. 1) and painful hiv-an (associated neuropathy).12 for both neuropathic pain syndromes, efficacy was
observed to last for 12 weeks. blinding was provided by a
control patch which contained sufficient capsaicin to induce
pain and erythema in a substantial number of subjects.
in 2009, qutenzatm was approved for the treatment of
peripheral neuropathic pain in non-diabetic adults in the
eu, and in the usa to manage neuropathic pain associated
with phn.7 one important aspect of this formulation relative
to low-concentration capsaicin formulations is removal of
the potential for variability in administration and a lack of
patient compliance, as its use occurs under the supervision
of a health-care professional, and it requires a single application for 30 or 60 min. furthermore, the environmental contamination issues associated with home use are avoided.

fig 3 multiple mechanisms underlie capsaicin-induced defunctionalization. inactivation of voltage-gated na+ channels and direct pharmacological desensitization of plasma membrane trpv1 receptors may contribute to an immediate reduction on neuronal excitability and responsiveness. more persistent effects may be due to the overwhelming of intracellular ca2+ buffering capacity by extracellular ca2+ entering
through trpv1 and being released from intracellular stores, with subsequent activation of calcium-dependent proteases and cytoskeleton
breakdown. microtubule depolymerization may interrupt fast axonal transport. at concentrations far in excess of those required to activate
trpv1, capsaicin can also render mitochondria dysfunctional by directly inhibiting electron chain transport. thus mitochondria are a key
convergence point for defunctionalization.

fig 2 activation of trpv1 by capsaicin results in sensory neuronal depolarization, and can induce local sensitization to activation by heat,
acidosis, and endogenous agonists. topical exposure to capsaicin leads to the sensations of heat, burning, stinging, or itching. high concentrations of capsaicin or repeated applications can produce a persistent local effect on cutaneous nociceptors, which is best described as
defunctionalization and constituted by reduced spontaneous activity and a loss of responsiveness to a wide range of sensory stimuli.

topical capsaicin for pain management

intracellular calcium and the associated enzymatic, cytoskeletal, and osmotic changes, and the disruption of mitochondrial respiration lead to impaired local nociceptor
function for extended periods26 (fig. 3).
the term ‘desensitization’ is often used to describe these
local effects of capsaicin on sensory nerve function, but is
unsatisfactory in several respects. the use of this nomenclature in capsaicin literature arose many years ago from psychophysical studies of human subjects who displayed reduced
reactions to painful stimuli applied to skin areas pretreated
with capsaicin.1 unfortunately, once the  xxxg2335xxx 
(trpv1) was recognized as a unique molecule entity, the psychophysical use of ‘desensitization’ evolved into pharmacological use, which denotes the reduction of responsiveness
of receptors, ion channels, or intracellular signalling pathways
after prolonged or repeated agonist exposures. in the continued presence of exogenous agonists such as capsaicin,
pharmacological desensitization of trpv1 itself may indeed
contribute acutely to analgesic efficacy. however, transient
effects on trpv1 are quite unlikely to account for the persistent pain relief seen clinically after either single treatments
with high-concentration capsaicin or repetitive administration
of low-concentration capsaicin. hence, the emerging preferred term for the persistent local effects of capsaicin is
‘defunctionalization’,26 27 which avoids conceptual confusion
with the intrinsic desensitisation of the trpv1 receptor.
loss of mitochondrial function due to calcium overload
and inhibition of metabolism may render affected nerve

fig 4 the site of action of topical capsaicin is in the skin, and pain relief is not mediated by transdermal systemic delivery. owing to near
insolubility in water, capsaicin is not readily absorbed into the microvasculature. when cutaneous nociceptors are hypersensitive and sometimes spontaneously active, localized defunctionalization of capsaicin-responsive nerve fibre terminals in the epidermis and dermis can reduce
the afferent barrage which may drive pain syndromes. inset shows how mitochondrial dysfunction leads to nerve terminal retraction.

calcium to flow down its steep electrochemical gradient into
nerve fibres. furthermore, as trpv1 is also expressed on
intracellular organelles, external capsaicin application can
cause release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum17
and induce additional intracellular calcium release from
internal stores via calcium-dependent calcium release.18
taken together, these multiple sources of calcium provide a
robust intracellular signal which can overwhelm local
calcium sequestration mechanisms. consequently, sustained
high levels of intracellular calcium can activate calciumdependent enzymes such as proteases,19 and can induce
the depolymerization of cytoskeletal components such as
microtubules.20 21 moreover, osmotic swelling due to the
chloride accumulation that must accompany influxes of positively charged ions also occurs.1 an additional effect of high
concentrations of capsaicin, which does not involve trpv1, is
a direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. numerous
mitochondria are present in the peripheral terminals of
nociceptors and may congregate there in response to nerve
growth factor (ngf).22 at concentrations much higher than
required to activate trpv1, capsaicin can compete with ubiquinone to inhibit directly electron chain transport.23 consequently,

can

transmembrane potential,24 and does so with an ec50 of

recognized effects, if trpv1-expressing sensory nerve fibres

in capsaicin-induced pain relief. the neurogenic inflammation which follows application of topical capsaicin is
due to the vascular actions of  xxxg2240xxx  and calcitonin
gene-related peptide (cgrp) released from c-fibres. mast
cell degranulation is contributory but not necessary.31
there is no evidence that the neurogenic inflammation
which accompanies topical capsaicin administration is
related to prolonged pain relief, even though it has long
been appreciated that systemic capsaicin can cause  xxxg2240xxx  release by nociceptors.32 in the early and
mid-1980s, researchers observed that skin  xxxg2240xxx 
levels were also significantly reduced after topical treatment
with capsaicin.33 at that time,  xxxg2240xxx  was thought to
be a fundamentally important signal for pain neurotransmission (hence the substantial efforts to develop substance
p receptor antagonists), and the coincidental reduction of
 xxxg2240xxx  content was inferred to play a causal relationship in capsaicin-induced pain relief. since then, substance
p receptor antagonists have failed as analgesics in a
number of clinical trials,34 and it is now widely recognized
that of all the neuropeptides released by c-fibres, cgrp is
a more likely potential contributor to pain pathophysiology,
particularly in migraine.35 if nociceptive nerve fibres retract
from the epidermis and dermis then all markers they
contain will be lost, and  xxxg2240xxx  is just one of many.
the reduction of  xxxg2240xxx  content in skin after topical
capsaicin administration is thus consequent to this process
of nerve fibre defunctionalization and retraction. the ‘ xxxg2240xxx  depletion’ hypothesis was used to describe the
mechanism of action (moa) of the low-concentration capsaicin formulations which became available in the 1980s, and,
unfortunately over the years, this hypothesis continues to be
repeated even in recent review articles and textbooks.

processes unable to maintain plasma membrane integrity
and thus cause collapse of nerve endings to the depth
where the capsaicin exposure was insufficient to irreversibly
overwhelm mitochondrial function (fig. 4). if nerve fibres in
skin retract or ‘degenerate’ to the depth at which mitochondrial function was preserved, it is expected that markers for
any constituent of those fibres will show reductions.
indeed, many immune-histochemical studies using antibodies to pgp 9.5 or other nerve fibre proteins provide evidence that capsaicin can produce highly localized loss of
nociceptive nerve fibre terminals in the epidermis and
dermis28 (fig. 5). however, it is important to recognize that
defunctionalization and nerve terminal degeneration are distinct phenomena, each with potentially different timecourses. in the simplest case, a loss of electrical excitability
(the loss of function) may occur via depolarization block or
sodium channel inactivation, independently of a loss of
axonal integrity. other important physiological roles such
as fast axonal transport of growth factors can also be compromised by capsaicin without axonal collapse.29 even
though a general parallel between capsaicin-induced functional and structural changes is expected, there may be
differences in the time-courses. for instance, in a recent
study of the time-course of recovery of cerebral-evoked
potential amplitudes to cutaneous heat-pain laser stimuli
after topical capsaicin treatment, functional recovery
occurred before the conventional cutaneous nerve markers
pgp 9.5 and trpv1 showed significant recovery30 (fig. 5). in
contrast, fibres marked by gap-43, which is expressed by
regenerating nerve fibres, did show good correlation with
the functional responses.
a persistent confusion which continues to appear in the
medical literature involves the role of ‘ xxxg2240xxx  depletion’

site of action and pharmacokinetics

hyperactive cutaneous nociceptors
consistent with the moa described above, and the selective
expression of trpv1, the preferential target for topically
administered capsaicin appears to be cutaneous nociceptors.
defunctionalization of these nociceptors would be expected
to produce pain relief if they are spontaneously active or
hypersensitive, or help maintain pain syndromes by retrograde transport of excitatory trophic factors which contribute
to neuronal hyperexcitability. indeed, evidence exists of a
role for both of these mechanisms in painful peripheral neuropathies and some other chronic pain syndromes.
direct correlations between aberrant activity of peripheral
nociceptors and pain reported by patients have not often
been observed due to the technical complexity of measuring
electrical activity in small-diameter nerve fibres in patients.
a technique known as microneurography, which measures
action potentials extracellularly, can be used, but this diagnostic procedure is somewhat invasive and may cause discomfort.45 in patients with painful small-fibre polyneuropathy,
both polymodal and mechanically insensitive c-fibres were
hyperexcitable, as indicated by reduced receptor thresholds,
spontaneous discharges, and exaggerated responses to
stimulation.46 interestingly, it was suggested that the clinical
and electrophysiological profiles of these patients resembled
the effects of experimental capsaicin application to the skin.
studies of hyperactive nociceptors in patients with erythromelalgia (burning pain of the feet, in some patients due to
mutations in nav 1.7 voltage-dependent sodium channels)
or diabetic neuropathy showed spontaneous activity in
nociceptive fibres, sensitization of mechano-insensitive
c-fibres, and a reversal of the proportion of the two main subtypes of c-fibres (which indicates a loss of function of polymodal nociceptors).47 microneurography studies also suggest
that hypersensitivity of c-fibres—particularly those classified
as ‘silent’ or mechanically insensitive under normal conditions—can contribute to tactile allodynia.48 therefore,
tactile allodynia may not arise only from inappropriate
spinal integration of electrical signals arising from a-fibres.
complementing human clinical data, spontaneous activity
of distal nociceptive fibres after nerve injury has been
recorded extensively in animal models, and correlated
directly with pain behaviour. animal studies have increasingly focused on aberrant electrical activity in injured nerve
fibres to the study of intact nociceptors after mechanical or
metabolic injuries to adjacent nerve fibres.49 thus, consequent to peripheral nerve lesions in primate and rodent
models, spontaneous activity (with an incidence up to
50%) develops in uninjured nociceptors that share the
same innervation territory of the transected fibres.50 – 52

there is no evidence that topical capsaicin works through a
transdermal systemic delivery into tissues other than the
skin. indeed, capsaicin is a very lipophilic, non-water-soluble
compound and resists diffusion into aqueous solutions such
as blood, and shows limited potential for transdermal delivery across human skin. even when capsaicin is absorbed systemically, the duration of exposure is very short. the oral
bioavailability of capsaicin was recently reported in humans:
after ingestion of 26.6 mg of capsaicin, the pharmacokinetic
parameters were a cmax of 2.5 (0.1) ng ml21, tmax of 47.1
(2.0) min, and t1/2 of 24.9 (5.0) min.36 there are no published
data from low-concentration formulations, but after 60 or 90
min capsaicin 8% patch treatments for painful peripheral neuropathy, plasma concentrations were also very low (with a
population cmax of 1.86 ng ml21) and transient (mean elimination half-life of 1.64 h).37 the longer elimination half-life of
topical capsaicin relative to oral exposure is likely to reflect
its slow release from the skin at the patch application site.
capsaicin is metabolized rapidly by several cytochrome (cyp)
enzymes present in the human liver, but in vitro studies
show that its metabolism in human skin is quite slow.38 the
implication for topical capsaicin-containing analgesics is that
capsaicin can reside at the site of action (i.e. skin) relatively
unchanged, whereas any capsaicin which is transdermally
absorbed is rapidly eliminated.
rapid delivery of capsaicin may promote, rather than
reduce, the tolerability of topical capsaicin. some of the
defunctionalization mechanisms discussed above can occur
very rapidly and in vitro loss of capsaicin responsiveness
may develop within 20 s.39 by driving cutaneous nociceptors
to a defunctionalized state quickly, the inevitable pungency
may be greatly mitigated. indeed, in clinical studies with
capsaicin 8% patch, ,2% of patients asked for early
removal of the patch due to intolerance.7
with respect to the site(s) of capsaicin action within the skin,
most studies point to the highest level of trpv1 expression in
nociceptive sensory nerve fibres, although there have been
several reports of trpv1 expression in skin cells other than neurones, particularly in cultured cells. for instance, one report40
provided indirect evidence that trpv1 activation mediated
functional responses in a human keratinocyte cell line
(hacat). however, when freshly dispersed human keratinocytes
were exposed to capsaicin by another group, no functional
response was observed at pharmacologically relevant concentrations and 300 mm capsaicin was cytotoxic independent of
trpv1.41 such studies emphasize that the presence of mrna
or even measurable protein does not necessarily ensure a physiological role for that protein in a cell type, and that the
interpretation of data from immortal cell lines can be problematic because their phenotypes may diverge from the source
tissue. the specificity of trpv1 immuno-detection in neural
elements, primarily in human dorsal root ganglion sensory
neurones and subsequently in peripheral nerves, has been
established repeatedly for high-titre, region-specific antibodies42 – 44 (fig. 5). thus, much of the evidence supports

neuronal rather than non-neuronal trpv1 as the primary
mediator of nociceptive processes in the skin.

the spinal nerve root or dorsal root ganglion (e.g. sjogren’s syndrome), which do not involve significant loss of cell bodies or
axons distal to the dorsal root ganglion, there may be
changes which are not length-dependent, with regionally preserved nociceptor innervation of target organs. spared nerve
fibres may also sprout in the skin in neuropathic conditions
such as phn, although overall density of enfs is generally
reduced. why density changes of cutaneous nerve fibres can
lead to chronic pain and particularly hypersensitivity will be
discussed below (fig. 6).
it is now widely accepted that nociceptors may develop
hyperexcitable electrophysiological properties, due to
exposure to relatively abnormal concentrations of neurotrophins such as ngf or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor (gdnf), or pro-inflammatory cytokines, as hypothesized and discussed previously.67 – 69 in chronic pain syndromes associated with denervation (fig. 6b), pain intensity
may correlate with reduced nociceptor immunostaining
because when there are only a small number of intact
nociceptive endings, it is more likely those endings will
have access to an abnormally high supply of the neurotrophins produced by the skin and ensheathing schwann
cells. although ngf has an important role in controlling

fig 6 alterations in skin innervation can be used to categorize neuropathic pain syndromes of diverse aetiologies. (a) innervation of the skin
serves to protect organisms through normal nociception. growth factors (e.g. ngf and gdnf) are constantly produced in the skin and transported retrogradely to sensory neurone cell bodies. (b) when cell bodies are lost or nerves cut and cannot regrow (‘static’ denervation neuropathies), reduced cutaneous innervation results in intact sensory fibres being exposed to abnormally high levels of neurotrophins; this
hypertrophic microenvironment is known to enhance excitability and promote sprouting. (c) in ‘dynamic’ denervation neuropathies, cyclic
metabolic or other types of stress render cell bodies unable to maintain their longest axons. during cycles of retraction and regrowth,
pro-inflammatory cytokines or other mediators may produce axonal excitation. in addition, intact nerve terminals are subject to a hypertrophic environment. (d) in a class of neuropathies or ‘dynias’ best exemplified by vulvodynia or gullian – barré syndrome (gbs), immune
system activation (or perhaps other factors) have caused local regions of hyperinnervation by cutaneous nociceptors and these nerve terminals display hyperexcitability.

selectively expressed in neurones. pgp 9.5 is the most commonly studied structural marker because it stains most
nerve fibres;  xxxg2240xxx , cgrp, gap-43, trpv1, and others
have also been used.53 for the assessment of small-fibre
neuropathy without relying upon punch biopsies, rapid
stimulation of cutaneous nerve fibres using a contact
heat-evoked potential stimulator (cheps) and measurement
of evoked potential has proven to be a useful non-invasive
measure, which correlates with trpv1 nerve fibres in skin
biopsies.54
immunohistochemical analyses have indicated that the
density of enfs in the epidermis is decreased in a wide range
of neuropathic pain syndromes, including phn,55 – 57 painful
diabetic neuropathy (pdn),58 59 painful hiv-associated neuropathy (hiv-an),60 complex regional pain syndrome,61 smallfibre neuropathy,62 – 64 metabolic syndrome,65 and fabry
disease.66 moreover, data suggest a positive correlation
between the extent of enf loss and the severity of pain in
phn,57 pdn,58 59 and hiv-an.60 thus, in most pain syndromes
considered to be neuropathic, sensory neurone axon density in
the target tissue (commonly the skin) is decreased. in contrast, in some other neuropathic pain conditions, such as in
proximal inflammatory or compressive disorders affecting

to their maximum capacity. for early phn, early pdn, hiv-an,
cancer-chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, partial nerve
injury, and post-nerve repair, and others, denervation and
nerve sprouting is a dynamic process which can fluctuate
depending on the metabolic health of the sensory neurones
and the degree to which they are exposed to toxins, etc.
(fig. 6c). sensory neuronal cell bodies which survive, and
their axons which sprout, may lead to hypersensitivity disorders. within this group, there are chronic painful syndromes
associated with overall increased nociceptor density;
examples include vulvodynia,83 84 burning mouth syndrome,85
interstitial cystitis,86 87 notalgia paresthetica,88 rectal hypersensitivity,43 gastro-oesophageal reflux disease,89 inflammatory and irritable bowel diseases,90 – 92 post-surgical breast
pain,93 and allergic rhinitis.94 these conditions do not reflect
nerve injury or disease per se, but may fall under the definition
of ‘neuropathic’ pain as pain arising as direct consequence of a
lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.95
denervation may be followed by aberrant re-innervation, proliferation with or sprouting of distal axons associated with
these pain syndromes (fig. 6d).
vulvodynia constitutes a very interesting exemplar of
chronic ‘dynias’ or idiopathic pain syndromes with regional
changes in skin innervation. it is characterized by painful
burning sensations, allodynia, hyperalgesia, and itching,
usually localized in the region of the vulvar vestibules.96
vulvar tissue arises from the same urogenital progenitors
as bladder; hence it might not be surprising to find parallels
involving hyperproliferation of nociceptors in bladder
tissue.97 in vulvodynia patients, the hypersensitivity of
vulvar c-fibres is well documented,98 99 and immunohistological evaluation of small-diameter nociceptive nerve fibres
shows increased densities relative to normal subjects.83
moreover, trpv1 expression appears to be significantly
increased in these proliferated nociceptors.87 patterns of
enhanced trpv1 expression similar to vulvodynia occur in
rectal hypersensitivity syndrome, which includes faecal
urgency and incontinence as symptoms.43 increases in
trpv1 expression appear to correlate with decreases in
heat and distension sensory thresholds.
as previously noted, regional innervation of the skin is heterogeneous in many types of peripheral neuropathy. during
sensory examination of chronic pain patients with denervation neuropathies, clinicians commonly observe areas of
reduced or absent thermal or tactile sensitivity immediately
adjacent to areas of hypersensitivity, allodynia, or spontaneous pain. to illustrate, in phn, patients have been
classified as displaying either ‘irritable nociceptors’ or
‘de-afferentation’,55 and later it was appreciated that both
of these phenomena could appear in the same patient.100
given the high level of skin innervation heterogeneity, including collateral or border zone sprouting in many neuropathies,
diagnostic approaches based on single punch biopsies and
sensory examinations of small areas could be misleading,
and might inappropriately lead to patients with a diagnosis
of de-afferentation to not be treated locally with potentially
effective pain medicines. as previously discussed, the lower

the survival and development of small-diameter neurones—
both sensory and sympathetic—it has become clear that
ngf also serves as an important signal for neuroimmune
and inflammatory processes in mature organisms.69 in
normal human skin, ngf-immunoreactivity is predominantly
in basal keratinocytes.70 production of ngf may be
up-regulated by inflammation or denervation of skin; rats
show a rapid and prolonged increase (5- to 10-fold) of ngf
mrna in denervated skin, distal nerves, and basal keratinocytes.71 in response to enhanced ngf supply, intact nociceptors may respond by becoming hyperactive, sprout, or both.
as a direct excitatory stimulant, ngf causes immediate excitation of nociceptors,72 resulting in prolonged hyperalgesia
and allodynia.73 74 in addition to this direct and rapid
effect, retrograde transport of ngf to sensory neurone cell
bodies may lead to the up-regulation of pro-excitatory proteins such as trpv1 and voltage-activated sodium channels,75 and down-regulation of anti-excitatory proteins
such as voltage-activated potassium channels.76 the
recent clinical successes of the anti-ngf neutralizing antibody tanezumab provide direct evidence for the role of
ngf in chronic pain syndromes.77 similar success has been
achieved by relocating painful injured nerves from ngf-rich
(subcutaneous) to ngf-poor (muscle) regions, with appropriate changes in ngf levels.78
although not as extensively studied as ngf, oversupply of
other neurotrophins produced in the skin such as gdnf79 or
artemin80 can also hypersensitize cutaneous nociceptors.
we postulate that much of the hyperactivity of nociceptors
in peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes of ‘static denervation’ (fig. 6b), ‘dynamic denervation’ (fig. 6c), and ‘hyperinnervation’ (fig. 6d) types is due to the relatively
hyperstimulating hypertrophic environment to which intact
or regenerating cutaneous nociceptors are exposed.
pro-inflammatory cytokines can also directly activate and
modify gene expression in sensory neurones, and there are
several sources of these molecules in close proximity to peripheral nerves. schwann cells, which have often been
thought of as having only a passive support role for peripheral nerves, are able to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines,81
including via a purinergic p2x7-mediated mechanism.82 wallerian degeneration is a post-traumatic process of the peripheral nervous system whereby damaged axons and their
surrounding myelin sheaths are phagocytosed by infiltrating
macrophages or leucocytes. during the process of infiltration
of inflamed or damaged peripheral nerves, these immune
system cells are known to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines.49 pain initiation by pro-inflammatory cytokines may
be particularly important in ‘dynamic’ denervation neuropathies such as pdn or hiv-an (fig. 6c).
according to the concept depicted in figure 6b, diabetic and
some types of traumatic neuropathy would fall under the
rubric of ‘classical denervation neuropathy’, because either
there is long-term ‘dying back’ of nerve fibres such as in established pdn or severed large nerve trunks. this would also apply
to severe phn with loss of cell bodies in the drg, or in chronic
phn when any surviving nerve fibres in skin will have sprouted

additional potential uses for topical
capsaicin

safety and adverse effects
capsaicin has been widely consumed orally by humans
throughout the world over centuries and comprehensive
reviews of its safety have not identified serious toxicity,115 116
even though some have conjectured that one or more
hepatic metabolites of capsaicin may be mutagenic at very
high concentrations.117 although the presumed lack of toxicity

498

of capsaicin in food does not preclude adverse effects related
to its actions on the skin, topical capsaicin is also generally
regarded as safe, either for medical3 or for cosmetic116 uses.
the primary adverse effects seem to be local, transient, application site reactions, mainly pain and erythema. aside from
acute, local application site reactions, published non-clinical118
and clinical7 data pertaining to the capsaicin 8% patch do not
suggest any special safety concerns regarding skin exposure to
capsaicin or capsaicin metabolites. transient increases in
arterial pressure associated with the pain experienced during
the application procedure were observed during clinical trials.7
the theoretical concern most relevant to chronic pain management is that in peripheral neuropathies associated with
cutaneous denervation, defunctionalization of cutaneous
nociceptors could leave areas of skin without sufficient protective sensation to prevent or avoid injury. in addition,
cutaneous c-fibres may play a role in blood flow regulation
and wound repair, as the  xxxg2240xxx  and  xxxg2240xxx 
released by c-fibres can stimulate growth of fibroblasts and
epithelial cells, while cgrp can stimulate growth of keratinocytes and epithelial cells.119 however, these theoretical
effects have not been observed in clinical practice. the
safety and efficacy of multi-week applications of lowconcentration capsaicin creams (0.025 to 0.075% w/w) have
been evaluated in six large double-blind trials with comparators and in other smaller studies with no reports relating to
either loss of protective sensations or impaired wound
healing.110 when the effects of topical capsaicin on sensory
nerve fibre function have been examined specifically in diabetic neuropathy patients, there have also been neither
detectable changes in sensory function nor adverse effects
relating to cutaneous perfusion.120 121 similarly, in an experimental model which uses a 48 h application of 0.1% w/w capsaicin cream under occlusion to induce nearly complete loss of
immunostaining for enfs and a very robust effect on dermal
nociceptors, no effect on wound healing has been reported
in pdn and hiv-an patients after repeated 3 mm punch
biopsies in capsaicin-treated areas on the leg.28 122
limited safety data are currently available for capsaicin 8%
patch for diabetic neuropathy, which may have led the ema to
restrict use of this treatment to non-diabetic neuropathy
patients.7 treatment with capsaicin 8% patch did not result
in changes suggestive of detrimental effects on sensory function in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy123 or painful
hiv- xxxd2216xxx  at 12 weeks after treatment. similarly, neurosensory
testing in hiv-an and phn patients treated with up to four
treatments over a period of 48 weeks revealed no evidence
of impairment.124 the reversibility of both sensory function
and enf innervation after capsaicin 8% patch treatment has
been documented in healthy subjects, with small reductions
in tactile and sharp pain sensations returning to normal
within 12 weeks and enf density to within a few per cent of
normal by 24 weeks.9 because of the high selectivity of capsaicin for the trpv1 receptor and the selective expression of
trpv1 in nociceptive sensory nerves, other skin sensory
nerve endings may remain intact and functional even with
pronounced defunctionalisation and reduction of cutaneous

other chronic pain syndromes may also be responsive to
topical capsaicin. for example, low-concentration topical
capsaicin has been evaluated in four small studies as a treatment for vulvar vestibulitis (vvs), a highly localized form of
vulvodynia, described above.101 – 104 daily administration of
low-concentration capsaicin patches placed directly on the
lower back have been evaluated in two controlled clinical
studies. pain reductions were observed both back pain
studies, without notable or systemic side-effects.105 106
topical, low-concentration capsaicin has been evaluated as
a treatment for osteoarthritis (oa) in multiple double-blind
vehicle-controlled clinical trials. from these data, albeit
limited by the potential for inadequate blinding in some
studies due to the lack of vehicle pungency, it can be inferred
that topical capsaicin appears modestly effective, either as a
monotherapy or as an adjunctive therapy.107
if the primary cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain lies
deep within joints and topical capsaicin does not provide substantial transdermal delivery, then the apparent efficacy of
topical capsaicin in lower back pain and oa could be postulated to be by cns modulatory mechanisms. another possibility is that alterations in, or sensitization of, cutaneous
nociceptors could be a contributing factor. such alterations
might be driven by unusually high concentrations of cytokines
or growth factors in joints which could either diffuse some distance away from the primary site of inflammation or promote
excitatory phenotypes in nearby collateral axons. to assess
sensory function in the skin overlying the joints of patients
with rheumatoid arthritis, capsaicin was injected intradermally over those joints.108 capsaicin-induced axon reflex vasodilatation was significantly greater over affected joints when
compared with age-matched normal controls and there was
also a correlation between axon reflex vasodilatation and
visual analogue pain score apparent in the rheumatoid group.
non-pain indications for topical capsaicin for which there
is some evidence include itch, psoriasis, and allergic rhinitis.109 110 based on the premise that intranasally delivered
drugs might exert direct or selective effects on the trigeminal
sensory nerves thought to be hyperactive in headache,111
controlled studies of intranasal capsaicin have suggested
efficacy in short-term prophylaxis in episodic cluster headache112 113 and migraine.114

nociceptors.26 capsaicin-insensitive nerve endings include
those which arise from ab-fibres which transduce tactile and
proprioceptive stimuli, as well as a subpopulation of c-fibres
and the majority of ad-fibres, which are primarily responsible
for mediating pin-prick.125 non-trpv1-expressing nerve
fibres are also capable of transducing thermal stimuli, as
they express trp receptors such as trpv2 (which is activated
at 528c) and  xxxg2336xxx  (which is activated at 398c).126 it should
be remembered that enf density measurements are a diagnostic tool, one of the several used to evaluate symptomatic
small-fibre neuropathies. age- and length-related reductions
of enf density occur in healthy individuals who display no
symptoms of sensory loss.127 therefore, perhaps it should
not be surprising that the complex cutaneous innervation
allows for selective defunctionalization of a subpopulation of
cutaneous nociceptors (i.e. those capsaicin-sensitive)
without significant loss of protective sensation. a recent
study using topical capsaicin in an occlusive 48 h application
reported elimination of immunostaining for both sensory
and autonomic nerve markers.128 however, such cutaneous
nerve fibre losses have not been observed with either the highconcentration patch8 9 or low-concentration creams.129
in conclusion, directed trpv1 agonist therapies, in which
nociceptor defunctionalization is restricted to discrete
target organs such as the skin, may be an attractive treatment to control localized pain or hypersensitivity. there is
good evidence for hyperactivity and proliferation of
cutaneous nociceptive c-fibres in numerous pain syndromes,
and thus topical trpv1 receptor agonist-mediated defunctionalisation warrants evaluation as an approach for their management. although the ‘ xxxg2240xxx  depletion’ hypothesis
was attractive in the 1980s, subsequent advances in our
understanding of cutaneous innervation and the responses
to topical capsaicin have rendered this hypothesis irrelevant.
reduction of  xxxg2240xxx  content in the skin is just one of
many consequences of defunctionalisation, and there is no
evidence that this process is related causally to pain relief.
an important advantage of the topical capsaicin approach
is that this drug is poorly absorbed transdermally in humans
and there appear to be few systemic adverse effects or even
local effects other than transient application-site reactions
such as pain and erythema. the recent approval of the capsaicin 8% patch, which is designed to be used episodically,
thus provides an alternative to low-concentration capsaicinbased medicines by providing for longer term pain relief in
some patients, while avoiding the requirement for repeated
daily self-administration, lack of patient compliance, and
possible home environmental contamination. given the
common use of topical capsaicin in a wide variety of
chronic pain syndromes and other conditions, we look
forward to further clinical evaluations of capsaicin 8%
patch and other innovative topical capsaicin formulations.
