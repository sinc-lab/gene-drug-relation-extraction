( xxxd3322xxx ) is a novel paradiphenylmethane derivative with antiproliferative
and antiestrogenic properties. like tamoxifen (tam),  xxxd3322xxx  binds to
the microsomal antiestrogen binding site with high affinity (a'd~ sodm).
but, conversely, not to  xxxg730xxx  or calmodulin. we now demon
strate that  xxxd3322xxx  competes for | 'i l|histrnnini- binding in rat cerebral
cortex with an affinity (a"â¡
= 4.5 â±2.6 x iii'" m) significantly greater
than that of the hi antagonist  xxxd3050xxx  (kâ¡= 7.2 â±2.2 x 10'* m),
despite the previous demonstration that  xxxd3050xxx  is up to 1000 times
more potent than  xxxd3322xxx  in antagonizing histamine-induced contraction
in canine trachea! smooth muscle.  xxxd3322xxx  demonstrates antiproliferative
activity against mcf-7 cells at concentrations between 1 x 111"and 1 x
10~* m; the icsovalue of  xxxd3322xxx  for growth inhibition  xxxd2274xxx  days in this
assay is 5 x 10 " m, a value equivalent to its k\ value for histamine
binding.  xxxd3322xxx  also competes for [3h|verapamil binding in membranes
from whole rat brain with an affinity equal to that for verapamil (ad =
4.0 â±1.8 x ml m); however, verapamil competes for [3h| xxxd3322xxx  binding
in brain membranes and rat liver microsomes with an affinity markedly
lower (k, ~ 1 x 10 4 m) than that of  xxxd3322xxx , suggesting allosteric
interactions between the verapamil and  xxxd3322xxx  sites. unlike  xxxd3322xxx ,
verapamil is not antiproliferative in vitro against mcf-7 cells at concen
trations up 1 x 10~5m, but, like  xxxd3322xxx , is cytotoxic at concentrations of
1 x i0~^ m. in immature oophorectomized rats, verapamil or  xxxd3322xxx 
alone is antiuterotropic; however, verapamil shows no antagonism of
exogenous estradiâ«!on uterine growth, as opposed to  xxxd3322xxx  which is a
partial antagonist. thus, the antiproliferative and antiestrogenic proper
ties of  xxxd3322xxx  either are not associated with calcium channel antagonism,
or result from a qualitatively different effect on channels than verapamil.
the in vitro antiproliferative effect of  xxxd3322xxx  (7.5 x io"6 m) on mcf-7
cells at 72 h is significantly reversed by 10 iuml-histidine (70.2 â±12.6%
reversal) and  xxxd2595xxx  (92.4 â±11.1% reversal), but not by lornithine, l- xxxd220xxx phenylalanine, or exogenous histamine. at lower
concentrations of tam (0.75 x 10~* m), where growth inhibition is
estrogen-reversible,  xxxd2793xxx , but not  xxxd2282xxx  or  xxxd2595xxx ,
causes significant reversal of growth inhibition (66.8 â±13.3%; p <
0.001). however at higher concentrations of tam (7.5 x l(r" m) where
only partial estrogen-reversibility is observed,  xxxd2793xxx  is without
effect, while  xxxd2282xxx  and  xxxd2595xxx  significantly reverse its growth
inhibition. the correlation of the histamine and  xxxd3322xxx  binding studies
with antiproliferative effects, as well as the significant reversal of growth
inhibition due to  xxxd3322xxx  and high dose tam by  xxxd2282xxx  and i methionine are compatible with the hypothesis that intracellular hista
mine is important to growth and that its action may be antagonized by
compounds which bind the antiestrogen binding site.

significantly (3) and proposed that newly formed intracellular
(endogenous) histamine, as opposed to mast cell histamine (4),
plays a major role in growth processes (5). he suggested that
the action of intracellular histamine could not be reproduced
by increasing the concentration of extracellular histamine, and
that its presence, being evanescent, is difficult to measure
directly (6). while this hypothesis has remained unproven and
often criticized (7), the recent demonstration that inhibitors of
 xxxg1040xxx  slow tumor growth supports such a
possibility (8).
we recently reported on the synthesis of a paradiphenyl
methane derivative, dppe3 (9), which, like tam binds with
high affinity (a',,= 50 hm) to the microsomal aebs (10) in rat
liver; conversely,  xxxd3322xxx  does not bind significantly to the
cytosolic er in rat uterus (9) or to calmodulin (11, 12). how
ever, like tam,  xxxd3322xxx  is antiproliferative in vitro (13) and
partially antagonizes the effects of exogenous estradiol on the
immature rat uterus in vivo (14). recent investigations indicate
that significant quantities of  xxxd3322xxx -like metabolites with affin
ity for aebs may be generated by the breakdown of triphenylethylene antiestrogens in vivo (15).
the structure of  xxxd3322xxx  resembles known histamine (hj)antagonists but binding studies (14, 16) and comparison with
 xxxd3050xxx  and hydroxyzine in blocking histamine (11,(-induced
contraction in canine trachea! smooth muscle (17) support the
likelihood that, although a weak hi-antagonist,  xxxd3322xxx  binds to
a site other than hi and h.. and that h|-antagonism is distinct
from that for aebs. in addition, phenothiazines, which also
have antihistaminic properties and are antiproliferative in vitro
(18,19), compete for [3h] xxxd3322xxx  binding in rat liver microsomes
(12); this affinity, rather than that for calmodulin, appears to
correlate better with their antigrowth effects at lower (1 x 10~6
m) concentrations (12). thus, many compounds which are
"antihistaminic," including  xxxd3322xxx , tam (17), and phenothia
zines, bind aebs and are growth antagonists.
based on these studies, we have hypothesized that  xxxd3322xxx  is
a unique ligand (non-11,. non-h2) for a histamine binding site,
that aebs is, in whole or in part, a novel histamine site which
mediates growth (14) and that the antiproliferative properties
of  xxxd3322xxx , tam, and phenothiazines reflect antagonism of
histamine at this site. that  xxxd3322xxx  demonstrates antiestrogenic
effects independent of er interaction (14) suggests that some
proportion of er may be "linked" to aebs (12, 14), a possi
bility supported by the previous finding that up to 20% of er
is associated with the microsomal fraction (20). in this model,
 xxxd3322xxx  is a less specific and somewhat lower affinity ligand than
tam, producing its effects through binding only to the aebs
moiety of the receptor complex while tam would bind both to
er and aebs. overall, the specificity of tam for the er/
aebs complex would be greater than  xxxd3322xxx  because of the
additional high affinity interaction with er (21); at lower

histamine and growth

concentrations of tam(<1

x 10 * m) which are predominantly

reversed by e2, its estrogen antagonism via er would predom
inate, while at higher concentrations, where estrogen reversal
is incomplete, its effects may be mediated by histamine antag
onism through aebs (13). linkage also might explain why
removal of the alkylaminoethoxy side chain from most triphenylethylene antiestrogens abolishes affinity for aebs, decreases
affinity for er and results in loss of antiestrogenic activity (22).
in order to test further the hypotheses that histamine may be
important for growth, that  xxxd3322xxx  may be a histamine antago
nist at a novel site and that aebs may be related to the putative
novel histamine binding site, we have now tested  xxxd3322xxx , the
h|-antagonist  xxxd3050xxx  and the h .-antagonists cimetidine
and ranitidine in a [3h]histamine radioligand binding assay in
synaptosomes and membranes from rat cerebral cortex, where
high affinity histamine sites have been reported (23); additional
binding studies have been carried out in rat hippocampus, an
area of the brain high in histamine receptors (24). we also have
assessed the ability of exogenous histamine,  xxxd2282xxx , and
other amino acids to reverse the in vitro antiproliferative effects
of  xxxd3322xxx  and jam on mcf-7 human breast cancer cells. in
addition, because  xxxd3322xxx  acts as a calcium channel antagonist
(17), as does tam (25, 26), we have tested  xxxd3322xxx  in a [3h]
verapamil radioligand binding assay in homogenates of whole
rat brain and verapamil in a [3h] xxxd3322xxx  radioligand binding
assay in rat liver microsomes; finally, we have compared vera
pamil and  xxxd3322xxx  for antiproliferative and antiestrogenic prop
erties.

in vivo studies
for the verapamil studies, two groups, each consisting of six rats,
received i.p. injections x3 days of either verapamil (4 mg/kg) alone, or
verapamil (4 mg/kg) l h before e2 (100 jig/kg), as described previously
for  xxxd3322xxx  (14). the animals were weighed daily with dosages adjusted
accordingly. sacrifice was by decapitation, following which the uteri
were immediately removed, trimmed of all excess tissue, and weighed.
since we previously failed to observe any significant interexperimental
variation in results for three separate groups of experiments for  xxxd3322xxx ,
thus suggesting a high degree of reproducibility for this assay, historical
values for  xxxd3322xxx  (4 mg/kg) alone, saline alone, e2 (100 mg/kg), and
 xxxd3322xxx  + e2 as reported previously (14) were used for comparison.
statistical analysis
for [}h]histamine binding studies, analysis of binding data for each
competitor using the ligand computer program (28) was employed.
for comparison of effects of test compounds on reversing the antiproliferative of  xxxd3322xxx  and tam, student's two-tailed t test was employed.

results
affinity for [3h]histamine binding in rat brain cortex and
hippocampus. in rat cortex synaptosomes a single high affinity
site for histamine is identified (ka= 5.4 â±2.1 x 10"' m; fimax
= 70.0 â±28.6 fmol/mg protein, mean â±sd, three determina
tions). competition for [3h]histamine binding in this prepara
tion by unlabeled histamine,  xxxd3322xxx ,  xxxd3050xxx , cimetidine,
and ranitidine is shown in fig. 1.  xxxd3322xxx  competes for [3h]hâ¡starninebinding with an affinity (k, = 4.5 â±2.6 x io"6 m)
significantly greater than that of the h,-antagonist  xxxd3050xxx 
(k, = 7.2 â±2.2 x 10~5 m, p < 0.001). for the h2-antagonists
ranitidine and cimetidine, the affinity for [3h]histamine binding
is significantly lower than that both for  xxxd3322xxx  and  xxxd3050xxx 
(k>~ 1 x 10"3m,/>< 0.001).
in membrane fractions of cortex and hippocampus, a high
capacity low affinity histamine site (cortex,  xxxg959xxx   xxxg962xxx  = 3.2 â±0.7 x
10~5 m; hippocampus, /td2= 1.75 â±.61 x 10~5 m) is demon
strated in addition to the high affinity site (table 1). since the
membrane fractions were prepared differently than synapto
somes, and may contain an additional proportion of rough
membranes, the presence of additional low affinity histamine
sites thus may reflect the methodology of preparation. in
[3h] xxxd3322xxx  radioligand binding assays in the same membrane
fractions, two distinct  xxxd3322xxx  sites are also identified (table 2).

for growth inhibition. the order of affinity and shape of the
binding curve for  xxxd3322xxx ,  xxxd3050xxx , and m..-antagonists versus
[3h]histamine in brain cortex synaptosomes parallel that pre
viously reported for the same compounds versus [3h]tam (15)
and [3h] xxxd3322xxx  (14) in rat liver microsomes at concentrations
up to 1 x 10~4 m. affinity for the histamine site, as shown
previously for the aebs/ xxxd3322xxx  site (14), correlates with antiproliferative activity as shown (fig. 2); whereas  xxxd3322xxx  inhibits
the growth of mcf-7 cells by 21.6 â±1.3% after 72 h (p <
0.001 versus control), the inhibition seen for  xxxd3050xxx  is only
2.8 â±5.1% (p = ns versus control) while cimetidine and
rannidine are completely without effect.
binding studies with a calcium channel antagonist. fig. 3a
shows the ability of unlabeled  xxxd3322xxx  and verapamil to compete
for | 'h ]\ erapamil binding in a membrane preparation of whole
rat brain. it may be seen that both  xxxd3322xxx  and verapamil
compete for [3h]verapamil binding with equal affinity (a',,= 4.0
â±1.8 x io"7 m). a more detailed analysis of this interaction
will be reported. in contrast, as shown in fig. 35, verapamil
shows a significantly lower affinity for the aebs/ xxxd3322xxx  site in
rat liver microsomes (kâ¡~ 1 x 10~4 m) as compared to  xxxd3322xxx 
(kd = 6.8 â±0.7 x io"8 m, p < 0.001). a similar weak affinity
of verapamil for  xxxd3322xxx  sites in whole brain membranes is
observed (data not shown). the weak affinity of verapamil for
the  xxxd3322xxx  site correlates with a similar weak interaction at the
histamine site in brain cortex (fig. 4).
comparison of biological effects of  xxxd3322xxx  and verapamil.
fig. 5 shows the effects of  xxxd3322xxx  and verapamil on the growth

an tipro iiferal ive effects occur between 1 x 10~7 and 1 x 10~5
m; the concentration required to inhibit cell growth by 50% at
7 days is 5 x 10~* m. for verapamil, no significant antigrowth
effects are seen up to concentrations of 1 x io"5 m. for both
compounds cytotoxicity with 100% cell death is observed in a
narrow range between 1 x 10~5 and 1 x 10"" m.
fig. 6 shows the effects on the uteri of immature oophorectomized rats of  xxxd3322xxx  and verapamil at an equivalent concen

concentrations does not prevent the binding of [3h] xxxd3322xxx  (14).
thus, on the basis of binding and functional studies,  xxxd3322xxx 
appears to interact at a histamine binding site that is distinct
from sites classified as hi or h2. the correlation of affinities
of histamine antagonists for histamine binding sites with affin
ities for  xxxd3322xxx  binding sites and with their antiproliferative
effects suggests that the putative novel histamine site, related
to the  xxxd3322xxx  site, mediates a function distinct from that of
established (hi and h â€¢)
histamine receptors. while the results
of the binding studies in brain indicate that all of the ligands
are significantly weaker than histamine itself for a high affinity
site (23), the demonstration that  xxxd3322xxx  selectively binds low
affinity histamine sites in cortex membranes4 suggests that the

which estrogen reversibility is incomplete,  xxxd2793xxx  is inef
fective whereas  xxxd2282xxx  demonstrates modest but significant
reversal (10.9 â±3.1%; p = 0.002) and  xxxd2595xxx  is most
effective (29.4 â±4.8% reversal; p < 0.001) and is equivalent to
e2 (35.4 â±4.0% reversal). when e2 is combined with lhistidine, the reversal of tam inhibition (7.5 x io"6 m) rises
to 44.5 â±6.1%, an increase just short of significance compared
to e2 alone (p = 0.07); however, the combination of e2 +
histidine + methionine results in a significantly greater reversal
(53.7 â±4.2%; p< 0.001) than e2 alone.
discussion
the kavalue for histamine and the k, values for  xxxd3050xxx ,
cimetidine, and ranitidine versus [3h]histamine in rat cortex are
in agreement with those of schwartz et al. (23, 29), although
higher affinity for h2-antagonists has been reported by stein
berg et al. (30). however, we now show that  xxxd3322xxx  competes
for [3h]histamine binding in rat cortex synaptosomes with an
affinity significantly higher than that for  xxxd3050xxx , despite
the fact that  xxxd3050xxx  is up to 1000 times stronger than
 xxxd3322xxx  as an h|-antagonist when tested in a functional assay of
histamine-induced contraction in canine trachea! smooth mus
cle (17). previously we have demonstrated in rat liver microsomes that h2-antagonists do not compete for [3h] xxxd3322xxx  or
i'll] i a\1 binding (14, 16), and that  xxxd3050xxx  at saturating

antiproliferative effects of  xxxd3322xxx  and other ligands which bind
aebs may be mediated through these sites. in cortex and
hippocampus membranes the number of high affinity  xxxd3322xxx 
sites approximates that of the low affinity histamine sites in the
picomolar range, whereas the icso of  xxxd3322xxx  for growth inhibi
tion (~5 x 10~6 m) closely approximates its k, value for the
single class of histamine binding sites in cortex synaptosomes.
the demonstration that  xxxd3322xxx  competes for [3h]verapamil
binding in rat brain membranes with an affinity equal to that
for verapamil supports our previous observation that  xxxd3322xxx 
may be a calcium channel antagonist (17). however, verapamil
competes poorly for [3h] xxxd3322xxx  binding both in rat liver microsomes and rat brain membranes suggesting that the  xxxd3322xxx  site
is a distinct allosteric site. the poor affinity of verapamil for
both the  xxxd3322xxx  and histamine sites suggests a basis for its lack
of antiproliferative action against mcf-7 cells and for the
failure to antagonize the effects of exogenous estradiol in the
immature oophorectomized rat uterus. alternatively, verapamil
may gain entry into cells less easily than  xxxd3322xxx ; however, the
finding that verapamil is significantly antiuterotropic //; vivo at
the same concentration as  xxxd3322xxx  makes this unlikely. thus,
the antiproliferative and antiestrogenic effects of  xxxd3322xxx  may
be mediated through histamine-associated mechanisms distinct
from calcium channel antagonism or, alternatively, may result
from channel interactions qualitatively different from those of
verapamil. conversely, since both  xxxd3322xxx  and verapamil are
antiuterotropic in the absence of estradiol and are cytotoxic ///
vitro at high concentrations, these properties may be related to
similar mechanisms of calcium channel antagonism.
the hypothesis that newly formed histamine is important for
growth gains support by the finding that  xxxd2282xxx , the im
mediate precursor of endogenous histamine reverses the growth
inhibition by  xxxd3322xxx  or high concentrations of tam. that lmethionine reverses the antiproliferative effects of  xxxd3322xxx  and
tam may be related to its function as a methyl donor, through

conversion to  xxxd3156xxx 
(31); one of the major
methyl acceptors is histamine (32), which, during catabolism,
is methylated to methylhistamine via the enzyme hisiamine-.v
methyltransferase. accumulation of methylhistamine inhibits
the further catabolism of newly formed (endogenous) histamine
as determined by l4c-labeling studies (33). the lack of effect of
exogenous histamine may reflect the poor penetration of this
amine into cells (34). these findings support kahlson's original
hypothesis on the role of intracellular histamine in proliferation
(5) and reinforce his suggestion that extracellular histamine
does not appear to play a role in this process (6).
the demonstration that l-arginine and  xxxd2793xxx , the pre
cursor amino acids for polyamine synthesis, do not reverse
significantly the antiproliferative effects of  xxxd3322xxx  on mcf-7
cells suggests that, unlike tam, the polyamine pathway is not
antagonized by  xxxd3322xxx . the reversal of the antiproliferative
effects of low concentrations of tam by  xxxd2793xxx  correlates
both with the previous demonstration of polyamine pathway
activation by er (35) and the reversal of the inhibitory effects
of low dose (1 x 10~7 m) tam by  xxxd3234xxx , spermidine, and
putrescine (36). at higher concentrations of tam,  xxxd2793xxx 
is ineffective and  xxxd2282xxx  and  xxxd2595xxx  effect partial
rescue, suggesting that antagonism of histamine may result
only at higher concentrations of tam where aebs binding
may predominate ( 13). the demonstration that the antiprolif
erative effects of  xxxd3322xxx  are reversed more significantly than
those of the tam by  xxxd2282xxx  and  xxxd2595xxx  may be
related to the previous finding that  xxxd3322xxx  is somewhat weaker
than tam for binding to aebs (9) and/or that the mechanism
of action of tam is more complex than  xxxd3322xxx , due to addi
tional interactions with er and calmodulin (11). tamoxifen

also antagonizes the action of protein kinase c and competes
for binding of [}h]phorbol im ristate acetate (37); because of
structural similarities, the possibility that  xxxd3322xxx  could have
similar interactions is currently under investigation.
in summary, there may exist in association with calcium
channels, histamine binding sites distinct from hi and ii
through which histamine mediates growth, an action antago
nized by compounds which bind aebs. a model, as previously
proposed by rocha e silva (38) is suggested for a novel nonhi, non-h2 histamine receptor complex in which the  xxxd3322xxx /
aebs site could be the higher affinity "non-critical" site of
binding for antihistaminic growth antagonists including  xxxd3322xxx ,
tam, and phenothiazines, through which these compounds
inhibit the binding of newly formed histamine at a lower affinity
"critical" site nearby. thus, the affinity of the various antago
nists, while in the range of 10-100 nm for aebs, becomes
"right" for their antiproliferative effects (ic50) in terms of
concomitant affinity (1-10 ^m) for the lower affinity histamine
site.
finally, we wish to speculate further that histamine binding
sites, perhaps associated with calcium channels, could be linked
to many growth receptors or regulatory sites, including protein
kinase c. for example, phorbol esters, which bind to protein
kinase c, are powerful inducers of  xxxg1040xxx  (39).
furthermore tam and phenothiazines (40) antagonize the
actions of protein kinase c indirectly (37), possibly at an
associated histamine site. thus, newly formed intracellular
histamine may mediate growth as a second messenger for
multiple receptors.
