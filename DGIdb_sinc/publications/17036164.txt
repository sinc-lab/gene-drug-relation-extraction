abstract
creatine kinase (ck) isoenzymes are essential for storing, buffering and intracellular transport of ‘‘energy-rich’’ phosphate
compounds in tissues with ﬂuctuating high energy demand such as muscle, brain and other tissues and cells where ck is
expressed. in brain and many non-muscle cells, ubiquitous cytosolic ‘‘brain-type’’ bb-ck and ubiquitous mitochondrial ck
(umtck) act as components of a phosphocreatine shuttle to maintain cellular energy pools and distribute energy ﬂux. to date,
still relatively little is known about direct coupling of functional dimeric bb-ck with other partner proteins or enzymes that
are important for cell function. using a global yeast two-hybrid (y2h) screen with monomeric  xxxg467xxx  as bait and a representative brain cdna library to search for interaction partners of  xxxg467xxx  with proteins of the brain, we repeatedly identiﬁed the
cis-golgi matrix protein (gm130) as recurrent interacting partner of  xxxg467xxx . since hela cells also express both bb-ck and
gm130, we subsequently used this cellular model system to verify and characterize the bb-ck-gm130 complex by gstpulldown experiments, as well as by in vivo co-localization studies with confocal microscopy. using dividing hela cells, we
report here for the ﬁrst time that gm130 and bb-ck co-localize speciﬁcally in a transient fashion during early prophase of
mitosis, when gm130 plays an important role in golgi fragmentation that starts also at early prophase. these data may shed
new light on bb-ck function for energy provision for golgi-fragmentation that is initiated by cell signalling cascades in the
early phases of mitosis.

introduction
creatine kinase (ck) isoenzymes catalyze the reversible
transfer of a high-energy phosphate group between phosphocreatine (pcr) and adp to maintain intracellular atp
levels in cells of high and ﬂuctuating energy demands. in

vertebrates, ﬁve distinct ck isoenzymes are expressed in a
tissue speciﬁc manner and localize to different intracellular
compartments [1, 2]. in sarcomeric muscle, dimeric cytosolic ‘‘muscle-type’’ mm-ck and octameric sarcomeric
mitochondrial smt-ck are always co-expressed, whereas in
brain and other non-muscle tissues and cells, dimeric

cytosolic bb-ck is co-expressed with octameric ubiquitous
mitochondrial umt-ck. in heart, the cytosolic dimeric
hybrid mb-ck isoform is additionally expressed in a cardiac muscle speciﬁc fashion [2].
the maintenance of a high energy state in the brain,
where bb-ck and umt-ck play a major role [3] is one of
the most important aspects of brain function [4]. in the
brain, atp can be formed by mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation and (an)aerobic glycolysis and is consumed
by the activities of ca2+- and na+/k+ atpases, glutamineglutamate neurotransmitter cycling, cell signalling, and
molecular synthesis and axonal transport of cell constituents
[4]. the two different ck isoforms, cytosolic bb-ck and
mitochondrial umt-ck constitute the components for a
functional intracellular energy shuttle in the brain [3, 5].
octameric umt-ck generates pcr in the peripheral mitochondrial intermembrane space, as well as in the cristae [6,
7], which is then used by the dimeric cytosolic brain-type
bb-ck to generate atp at sub-cellular sites of high atp
turnover [2, 8].
it is known that bb-ck plays an essential role in the
transport of neurotransmitters in neurons [9] and ions in
astrocytes [10, 11], as well as in the regeneration of atp
during  xxxg746xxx  signalling [12]. although it has
been shown that the brain of bb-ck knockout mice can
metabolically compensate to some extent for the loss of bbck activity, these mice revealed diminished habituation and
spatial learning acquisition [13]. moreover, bb-ck deﬁcient mice display a larger intra-infra-pyramidal mossy ﬁbre
ﬁeld size and enlarged ventricular space [13]. in the brain,
bb-ck together with its substrates pcr and cr might not
only be important for energy homeostasis but can also exert
a general neuroprotective role, as shown by the supplemental feeding of cr in animal models for seizures, hypoxia,
or neurodegenerative disorders [14, 15].
in order to identify novel interaction partners of bb-ck
and to ascertain the role of bb-ck in the brain and other
cells that express this ck isoform, we performed a yeast
two-hybrid (y2h) screen to identify  xxxg467xxx -interacting proteins out of a brain cdna library. dimeric bb-ck is
expressed as the functional complex in many cells like brain
cells, ﬁbroblasts, kidney cells, spermatozoa and last but not
least also hela cells [3]. a brain library was chosen for the
screen because the levels of bb-ck are generally very high
in brain [16] and the probability to ﬁnd novel interaction
partners may be enhanced by using  xxxg467xxx  as bait in combination with a brain cdna library. here, we report the
human golgi matrix protein 130 (gm130) as a novel
interaction partner of human  xxxg467xxx . in a lexa based y2h
screen, using a n-terminally truncated form of human  xxxg467xxx 
as a bait (amino acids 103–381), we show that mainly a
stretch of gm130 comprising the amino acid residues 433–
679 of this protein are responsible for this interaction.

gm130 belongs to the golgin protein family [17] and is
involved in the assembly and maintenance of the golgi
apparatus [18]. golgins are coiled-coil proteins associated
with the golgi apparatus, that are believed to be involved in
the tethering of vesicles and the stacking of cisternae, as
well as other functions such as association with the cytoskeleton. many golgin proteins are peripheral membrane
proteins that are recruited by gtpases. several golgins have
been described in animal cells, and some in yeast, but the
relationships between golgins of different species are hard to
deﬁne because their protein sequences are quite divergent
although they share common structural features. a subset of
the golgins contains a carboxy-terminal region, called the
grip domain that mediates binding to the golgi membranes. the grip domain was named after the four proteins
in which it was originally found (golgin-97, ranbp2-a,
imh1p and p230/golgin-245) [19, 20]. the n-terminal 73
amino acid residues of gm130 interact with the vesicle
docking protein p115 [21], which suggests a role for
gm130 in the vesicular trafﬁc between endoplasmic reticulum (er) and golgi stacks. gm130 also interacts with
grasp65, a golgi reassembly and stacking protein of
65 kda that is involved in the reformation of the golgi
complex after mitotic cell division [22]. the interaction
between p115 and gm130 is inhibited upon mitotic phosphorylation of gm130 by cyclin-dependent kinase i [23].
as a model system for dividing cells, we used hela cells
that express bb-ck as well as gm130 endogenously. here,
we show for the ﬁrst time that gm130 and bb-ck interact
in cultured cells in vivo and that co-localization of the two
endogenously expressed proteins occurs speciﬁcally in the
early prophase of mitosis at the golgi apparatus, just prior to
its fragmentation for cell division. altogether, our data
reveal new aspects on the role of bb-ck for energy provision in the regulation of the cell cycle.

materials and methods
plasmid constructs
for the yeast two hybrid screen, human  xxxg467xxx  cdna was
ampliﬁed by pcr from the cdna template (kindly provided by dr. jean-paul steghens, lyon, france) and inserted
into the plexa-dir bait vector (dualsystems biotech, zürich, switzerland) resulting in a 480 amino acid  xxxg467xxx  fusion
protein. the human brain cdna library in the pact2
vector was obtained from clontech laboratories, inc, palo
alto, usa. the full-length rat gm130 construct, as well as
its deletion constructs with amino acids 433–679, 679–986,
75–271 and 272–986 in the pact2 vector were kindly
provided by dr. francis a. barr, munich, germany [24].
for the gst construct, full-length human  xxxg467xxx  cdna was

55
ampliﬁed by pcr and subcloned into the glutathione stransferase (gst) vector pet42 (+) (novagen inc, madison,
usa). all clones derived by pcr were veriﬁed by dna
sequencing. protein expression was veriﬁed by western
blotting using speciﬁc antibodies for both proteins.

bacterial recombinant fusion proteins
 xxxg1073xxx  fusion protein of bb-ck was
prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
brieﬂy, expression of fusion protein in e. coli bl21 cells
(invitrogen, carlsbad, usa) was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside (iptg) for 3–5 h. cells
were pelleted at 4 c, 4000 g for 20 min. the pellet was
lysed in lysis buffer (0.5 m sucrose, 20 mm tris ph 8.0,
15 mm  xxxd26xxx ), with addition of protease
inhibitor cocktail (roche, according to the manufacturer’s
instruction). after incubation with lysozyme and dnase i
(400 u/ml) for 30 min on ice, cells were sonicated and debris
was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 c 10,000 g.
the supernatant was afﬁnity puriﬁed on glutathione-agarose
(sigma, buchs, switzerland). expression and puriﬁcation
were controlled by sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

collected from the 0.5/0.86 m sucrose interface. after
dilution to 0.25 m sucrose using pm buffer, the membranes
were centrifuged at 6500 g for 30 min at 4 c, washed in
0.25 m pm, re-centrifuged and resuspended in the same
buffer. golgi fraction was veriﬁed by western blotting using
gm130 as golgi marker protein.
gst-pull down assay
pulldown of gm130 from rat liver golgi stacks was
achieved by mixing 20 ll of 50% glutathione-agarose
equilibrated in binding buffer (20 mm tris ph 7.4, 65 mm
nacl, 2.5 mm mgcl2, 0.05% np-40, 1 mm dtt) with
20 lg gst- xxxg467xxx  or gst alone. after incubation at 4 c
for 1 h, 10 lg of the rat liver golgi stacks preparation was
added and incubated for 1 h at 4 c. glutathione beads were
then recovered by centrifugation and washed three times
vigorously with binding buffer. proteins bound to the beads
were eluted by sds sample buffer and analyzed by western
blotting using mouse-anti gm130 (bd bioscience pharmingen, san diego, usa) and rabbit-anti gst antibody
(sigma, buchs, switzerland).
western blotting

yeast two-hybrid assays
yeast two-hybrid screening assays were performed as
described previously [25]. brieﬂy, after excluding selfactivation of the  xxxg467xxx  bait construct, the yeast reporter
strain dsy-1 (dualsystems biotech, zürich, switzerland)
was co-transformed with the  xxxg467xxx  bait and the brain cdna
library and transformants were grown on selection plates
lacking histidine, leucine and tryptophan. positive transformants were tested for b-galactosidase activity using a
ﬁlter assay [26]. library plasmids were isolated from positive clones and assayed in a bait dependency test and with a
bait encoding a lexa-laminc fusion as control, using a
mating strategy [27]. the identity of positive interactors was
determined by dna sequencing.

preparation of rat liver golgi stacks
rat liver golgi stacks were prepared as described previously
[28]. brieﬂy, rat liver was homogenized with a glass-teﬂon
potter in ice-cold 0.5 m sucrose-pm buffer (0.1 m sodium
phosphate, ph 6, 7.5 mm mgcl2) to a ﬁnal concentration of
0.6 g liver/ml. the homogenate was applied to a two-step
gradient comprising 1.3 and 0.86 m sucrose-pm buffer.
after centrifugation at 25,000 rpm using a sw28.ti rotor
(beckmann) for 2 h at 4 c, the golgi fraction was

sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on
10% polyacrylamide gels. for western blot analysis,
proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(schleicher&schuell, bottmingen, switzerland). primary
antibodies were overlaid with goat anti-rabbit (amersham
pharmacia biotech, sweden) or anti-mouse (calbiochemnovabiochem international, inc., usa) horseradish
peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescence was detected using the pico detection kit (pierce
biotechnology, rockford, usa).
cell culture and bfa treatment
monolayer cultures of hela cells were grown at 37 c and
5% co2 in dmem high glucose medium, containing 10%
fcs (invitrogen). for immunocytochemical analysis, cells
were plated on gelatine coated glass coverslips 24 h before
treatment with or without 200 lg/ml brefeldin a (bfa,
sigma-aldrich). bfa incubation was performed for 60 min
at 37 c and 5% co2.
immunoﬂuorescence staining and confocal imaging
hela cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with
pre-warmed mp buffer (65 mm pipes ph 6.9, 25 mm

56
hepes, 10 mm egta, 3 mm mgcl2), pre-ﬁxed for 2 min
with 3% pfa in mp buffer and permeabilized for 4 min
with 0.2% triton x100 in mp. after extensive washing with
mp, cells were ﬁxed for another 6 min then blocked with
blocking buffer (5% bsa in mp). primary and secondary
antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated for
60 and 40 min, respectively. dilutions were: chicken antihuman bb-ck [29] 1:50, rat anti- xxxg2347xxx  (abcam)
1:100, mouse anti-gm130 (bd pharmingen) 1:100, antichicken cy3 (molecular probes, leiden, the netherlands),
1:500, anti-mouse cy5 (rat ig absorbed, jackson, bar harbor, usa) 1:100, anti-rat cy2 (mouse ig absorbed; jackson)
1:100. pre-immune serums have been used as controls to
show speciﬁcity of the antibodies under the conditions
tested (data not shown).
the imaging system consisted of a leica inverted
microscope dm irb/e, a leica true confocal scanner tcs
sp1 (leica microsystems ag, glattbrugg, switzerland) and
a fujitsu-siemens workstation (fujitsu siemens computer
bv., regensdorf, switzerland). the images were recorded
using a leica pl apox63/1.4 oil immersion objective. the
system was equipped with ar and he/ne lasers. image
processing was done using imaris 4.0 (bitplane ag, zurich,
switzerland). this software was used to visualize single
sections from the confocal data set. final assembly of ﬁgures was made with adobe photoshop cs (adobe systems,
san josé, usa). for each phase of mitosis, at least three
independent cells showing the same staining pattern were
recorded and pictures representing one single layer of the
sections were shown.

to identify putative novel interaction partners of  xxxg467xxx , we
screened a human brain cdna library using a lexa based
yeast two-hybrid system (y2h), taking  xxxg467xxx  as bait. we
fused the c-terminal 278 amino acid domain of human bck to lexa (fig. 1a). this fusion protein includes the
isoform speciﬁc box b260 that discriminates  xxxg467xxx  from mck, as well as the highly conserved cys 283 near the catalytic site [30]. expression of the fusion protein in yeast was
veriﬁed by western blot (data not shown).

interaction partner for  xxxg467xxx  which was also found in a
former y2h screen with human  xxxg467xxx  as bait of our colleagues (dr. b. wieringa university of neijmegen, nl,
personal communication). here, we focus on the experiments analyzing the interaction between bb-ck and
gm130 because this result suggests that bb-ck interacts
with a golgi structural protein and might be involved in the
assembly, fragmentation or turnover of the golgi apparatus.
gm130 interacts via its 433–679 amino acid domain

gm130 binds via its n-terminus to the vesicle-tethering
protein p115 [21] and via its c-terminus to the n-myristoylated

to identify the precise region in gm130 that is required
for the interaction with  xxxg467xxx  we performed a y2h
interaction assay with various deletion constructs of rat
gm130 (fig. 2). expression of all gm130 constructs, as
well as that of bb-ck, conﬁrmed by western blotting
(data not shown), conﬁrmed a constant expression proﬁle.
interaction of gm130 and  xxxg467xxx , as indicated by bgalactosidase activity, could be shown for the full-length
gm130 construct, but also for constructs 433–679 (amino
acid residues) and 272–986. the strong coloration
obtained. with full length gm130 may be a hint on the
quality of its interaction with  xxxg467xxx . it is possible that the
full-length construct of gm130 forms dimers, which then
in turn would inﬂuence the quality of the interaction with
 xxxg467xxx . no interaction, however, could be detected for the
gm130 constructs 679–896 and 75–271, indicating that
the amino acids 433–679 of gm130, which include the
predicted poly-proline domain (black) [24], play a role in
the interaction with  xxxg467xxx . this stretch in gm130 contains no coiled-coil, which argues for the speciﬁcity of the
interaction with  xxxg467xxx . the helical coiled-coil structures
and non-helical termini of the golgin proteins are proposed to be a clue to their function [19]. these results
suggest that the central part of gm130 is sufﬁcient for
the interaction with  xxxg467xxx , however the increased signal
in case of the full-length constructs indicates a structural
stabilization that aids this interaction.

full-length gm130, as well as the indicated deletion constructs of rat
gm130 with different sizes (length in amino acids), were tested against the
human  xxxg467xxx  bait construct for b-galactosidase activity. grey colour
colony indicates protein–protein interaction via x-gal cleavage by the reporter b-galactosidase. all constructs containing the poly-proline domain
interact with  xxxg467xxx  and amino acid residues 433–679 of gm130 are
responsible for this interaction.

interaction of bb-ck with gm130 in rat liver golgi stacks
to conﬁrm the y2h in vivo data biochemically, gst-pulldown assays were performed. for this, full-length human
 xxxg467xxx  was n-terminally fused to gst and expressed in
e. coli. puriﬁcation of dimeric functional bb-ck fusion
protein (80 kda) and gst alone (37 kda) was achieved by
afﬁnity binding to glutathione agarose-beads (fig. 3a).
to enrich gm130, rat liver golgi stacks were prepared as
described previously [28]. gm130 is a cytoplasmic protein
that is tightly bound to golgi membranes [32] and remains
attached to the golgi membrane stacks during the preparation procedure (input fig. 3b). the proteins eluted from
the pulldown complex were analyzed by western blotting. antibodies used were anti-gst and anti-gm130
(fig. 3b). we demonstrate here, that gm130 from the

rat liver golgi stacks were prepared as described [28] and incubated with

recovered complexes were analyzed by western blotting. gm130 in the

control.

expressed alpha-tubulin (green) to verify the mitotic status of the cell, bb-ck (red) and gm130 (blue). pictures shown here represent single confocal sections
of the overlays and the individual channels. in the interphase, bb-ck staining shows an overall cytoplasmic distribution. in the prophase, the early and the late
anaphase, bb-ck condenses to certain cellular structures, but this condensation overlaps with the gm130 staining speciﬁcally only in the early prophase,
indicated by the white signal in the overlay (arrow in inset). no such overlapping was observed during the later phases of the cell cycle (see fig. 4, continued),
but a signiﬁcant overlap of bb-ck staining with tubulin staining was seen during metaphase and anaphase (see fig. 4, continued). pictures were taken as
sequential laser scans to prevent potential overlapping of ﬂuorescence signals emitted by the secondary antibody-coupled ﬂuorochromes of neighbouring
excitation wave lengths (scale bar 5 lm).

fig. 4. (continued)

golgi membrane fraction (fig. 3b input) binds to gst-bbck in vitro but not to the gst control. since gm130 is
ﬁrmly bound to golgi membranes, it is likely that the latter
are also pulled down via gm130 interaction with gst-bbck. thus, the interaction between bb-ck and gm130 was
also conﬁrmed by a biochemical assay with functional dimeric bb-ck.

co-localization of gm130 and bb-ck at early prophase in
mitotic hela cells
gm130 plays an important role in the golgi fragmentation
during mitosis. fragmentation is induced by phosphorylation of gm130 on serine 25 by the  xxxg407xxx  kinase [21, 23].
the dephosphorylation of gm130 at the end of mitosis is

60
performed by the trimeric form of pp2a with the ba
regulatory subunit [33]. bb-ck catalyzes the reaction,
which leads to the transfer of high energy phosphates from
pcr to adp to provide atp and thus energy for atpdependent processes including cell division. to ﬁnd out
whether bb-ck is indeed associated with gm130 also in

cells in vivo, we immunostained endogenously co-expressed
bb-ck and gm130 (fig. 4) in cultured hela cells. further,
we addressed the question of whether this association of
bb-ck with this gm130 golgi protein and thus with the
golgi apparatus were permanent or transient during certain
mitotic phases. hela cells are used as gold-standard cell

fig. 5. bfa disrupts the golgi apparatus and bb-ck-gm130 co-localization in early prophase is abrogated. bfa treatment alters the distribution of gm130
(blue) to be dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (interphase). at early prophase, no condensation of bb-ck (red) and gm130 was observed as it was at early
prophase of control cells (fig. 4, early prophase, in inset of bb-ck-staining). pictures were taken as sequential laser scans (scale bar 5 lm).

culture model for studying processes of cell division since
they are a well characterized cell-system to follow mitosis
[33, 34]. hela cells are known to express both bb-ck as
well as gm130 [3, 35], which is fully conﬁrmed by our data
(see fig. 3b). mitotically active cells were identiﬁed by
staining of the microtubuli (green, alpha-tubulin), allowing
the observation of all mitotic stages (fig. 4). in interphase
cells, bb-ck showed a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm, as reported by previous studies [8, 36] and was
mostly excluded from the nucleus. however, in early prophase, a clear condensation of bb-ck to one perinuclear
site could be observed. this correlated with the condensation of the gm130 and the increased tubulin staining at the
same site, as indicated in the inset with a white arrow in
fig. 4 (early prophase). however, during late prophase,
where the separation of the centrosomes begins, the accumulation of bb-ck disappeared, indicating that the interaction between bb-ck and gm130 is only transient.
therefore, the speciﬁc co-localization of bb-ck and
gm130 is clearly restricted to the onset of mitosis when
disassembly of the golgi apparatus begins (fig. 4, compare
the column labelled ‘‘early prophase’’ with the other stages
of mitosis). a co-localization of bb-ck and tubulin was
reported earlier [37, 38], which was also observed here
during meta- and anaphase of cell division (fig. 4,
continued). as a control, the same set of experiments was
carried out with brefeldin a (bfa) (fig. 5), which causes
golgi membranes to reversibly fuse with the er [39]. in
contrast to control cells, bfa-treated hela cells exhibited
no condensation of bb-ck and gm130 at early prophase
(fig. 5). in normal cells, the interaction between bb-ck and
gm130 at that early mitotic stage clearly was only transient.
this ﬁnding may be related to the fact that provision by bbck of high energy phosphates provide the energy that is
required to start the signalling cascade that leads to
fragmentation of the golgi apparatus during cell division
[33, 40]. subsequently, bb-ck would no longer be needed
at this golgi-related micro-compartment.

discussion
in this study, we report that dimeric human bb-ck binds
speciﬁcally to human gm130 in vitro and in cell cultures
in vivo. screening of a human brain cdna library with a
lexa- xxxg467xxx  bait construct with the c-terminus (103–381)
of monomeric  xxxg467xxx , including the isoform speciﬁc box
b260 and the highly conserved cys 283 near the catalytic
site of  xxxg467xxx , resulted in the isolation of 64 clones of which
eight were identiﬁed as gm130 (fig. 1b). this interaction
between bb-ck and gm130-golgin was conﬁrmed by a
gst pulldown assay (fig. 3b), as well as by co-localization
in vivo of bb-ck and gm130 in hela cells, which

co-express both proteins endogenously, by confocal
microscopy (fig. 4). if cdna coding for the  xxxg467xxx  subunit
is expressed in cells or tissues, two monomers are always
assembled to form functional bb-ck dimers that are the
functional entities [41, 42]. this strongly suggests that in
vivo gm130 indeed interacts with the bb-ck dimer.
gm130 is a cytoplasmic protein that is tightly bound to
golgi membranes and represents a part of a larger oligomeric complex. this complex consists of golgi reassembly
stacking protein 65 (grasp65), p115 and giantin, which
are referred to as tethering proteins [43]. gm130 belongs to
the golgin protein family and predictions from the protein
sequence suggest that gm130 is an extended rod-like protein with coiled-coil domains. the so called ‘‘string theory’’
[44] proposes a predominant role for the gm130 protein in
holding transport vesicles in place [45, 46]. our deletion
analysis showed that a region around the predicted polyproline domain of gm130 in fig. 2 (amino acids 433–679)
is involved in the interaction with  xxxg467xxx . as this domain is
not part of the helical coiled-coil structure that may be sticky
by nature, it is less likely that bb-ck is just simply nonspeciﬁcally sticking or adventitiously bound to gm130. the
association between the two proteins is transient and limited
to a very narrow time window during mitosis, which
strongly argues against a non-speciﬁc interaction between
bb-ck and gm130. to determine whether the above domain of gm130 causes the interaction, deletions of different
residues, e.g., the prolines within this region of gm130 may
give further insights.
the golgi apparatus occupies a central position in the
classical secretory pathway, where it receives de novo synthesized proteins from the er, and functions to distill
posttranslational processes and to sort cargo to their ﬁnal
destinations [47]. its mode of inheritance after cell division
is still under debate and several models have been proposed:
de novo formation [48], ﬁssion [49], and disassembly–
reassembly [50]. the latter process is regulated by cdc2cyclin b kinase [51]. gm130 is a substrate of  xxxg407xxx  [21, 52]
and upon phosphorylation on serine 25, the vesicle tethering
factor p115 can no longer bind to gm130 [21]. mitotic
golgi fragmentation in vitro depends on  xxxg407xxx -cyclin b
activity. phosphorylation of gm130 and dissociation of
p115 are synchronized with the conversion of golgi cisternae into small vesicles. since cyclin b2 has been localized to the golgi complex in interphase cells [53], it is
possible that  xxxg407xxx  phosphorylates gm130 during prophase
to initiate the disassembly of the golgi complex [33].
interestingly, many different atp-requiring processes are
taking place in late prophase at the golgi: mitogen-activated
protein kinase 1 ( xxxg1361xxx ) and  xxxg1777xxx  are required
for golgi complex fragmentation [40], while raf1 is necessary to activate  xxxg1361xxx  in the ﬁrst place. moreover,  xxxg1361xxx 
is found on the golgi membranes in late prophase [54].

62
as high energy phosphates are needed for the various
phosphorylation processes, it is likely that the interaction
between gm130 and bb-ck would facilitate gm130
phosphorylation by atp-requiring protein kinases. indeed,
the interaction between bb-ck and gm130 seems to be
transient and restricted to the prophase of the cell cycle. this
is exactly the time point when energy is needed to initiate
the fragmentation of the golgi apparatus by signalling
pathways. atp needed for these processes could thus be
provided by bb-ck associated with gm130 on the golgi
membrane. the transient co-localization of bb-ck and
gm130 was demonstrated with immunostaining of hela
cells at different phases of mitosis for endogenously coexpressed gm130 and bb-ck. during interphase, bb-ck
was always distributed diffusely throughout the entire
cytoplasm, however, in early prophase, a typical condensation of bb-ck that clustered together with gm130 on the
golgi apparatus (fig. 4) could be demonstrated very clearly
and reproducibly. co-staining experiments in bfa treated
hela cells (fig. 5) did not show a clear association between
the two proteins. nevertheless, we suggest that the interaction of bb-ck with gm130, due to its transient appearance during early prophase only, is speciﬁc and cannot be
explained by adventitious binding of bb-ck to gm130 due
to a potentially stickiness between the two proteins. second,
since the interaction is only transient, this indicates that bbck associates with gm130 and thus with the golgi apparatus at times when energy provision to the golgi must be
high, e.g., for golgi fragmentation that is initiated by energy-requiring signalling pathways [23, 40, 54]. thus, it is
tempting to speculate that bb-ck may facilitate the provision of energy to kinases that are recruited to signalling
steps upon initiation of the prophase. the action of bb-ck
would be to maintain locally high atp levels and a high
atp/adp ratio that would favour kinase reactions. since
the interaction between bb-ck and gm130 obviously does
not seem to be permanent in hela cells in vivo, albeit we
found it in the y2h screen, it is likely to be a regulated
phenomenon itself, dependent on the cell cycle. such transient, possibly weak, but speciﬁc ck micro-compartments
have been found earlier in another context [55].
interestingly, bb-ck was recently shown to be in a
complex together with the chloride intracellular channel
(clic), dynamin i, a-tubulin, b-actin and 14-3-3 [37]. in
line with the idea that gm130 may recruit bb-ck to form
speciﬁc micro-compartments, gm130 was recently shown
to target the protein kinase ysk1 to the golgi, which has
protein 14-3-3 as a substrate [24]. 14-3-3 is a protein enriched in brain and modulates ion channel functions that
regulates diverse cell signalling pathways, including activation of protein kinases, cell cycle control, neural development, cell migration and polarization and pathogenesis of
bacteria and viruses [56]. in full support of the data reported

herein, recent results revealed a co-puriﬁcation of bb-ck
and gm130 in a proteomic approach with golgi fraction
isolated from lactating mammary gland [57].
taken together, these data conﬁrm that bb-ck is structurally and functionally coupled in a dynamic and cell cycle
dependent manner to the golgi apparatus. there, bb-ck is
most likely a member of a large protein complex that also
comprises several protein kinases. this raises a novel aspect
for a new function of members of the ck family and represents a ﬁrst indication that cks are linked to signalling
cascades regulating the integrity of the golgi apparatus and
thus may be involved in the control of the cell cycle.
