 xxxd2318xxx -induced apoptosis depends on acyl coa-synthetase.  marine n-3 fa are known to inhibit proliferation or induce cell death in several cancer cell lines. we have previously reported that epa promotes apoptosis in the lymphoma cell line ramos, whereas the u-698 cell line is insensitive to epa. furthermore, acyl-coa synthetase (acs) is expressed to a higher extent in ramos cells compared to u-698 cells. to investigate the importance of acs in epa-induced apoptosis, we incubated ramos cells with triacsin c, an inhibitor of acs. this caused a 70% reduction in the amount of cell-associated epa and diminished activation of epa. in addition, triacsin c caused a 90% reduction in epa-induced apoptosis. several different approaches were tried to overexpress  xxxg49xxx  in epa-insensitive lymphoma cell lines, but we did not obtain viable cells with high expression of acyl-coa activation. however, we show that overexpression of  xxxg49xxx  in the more robust cos-1 cells caused up to a fivefold increase in activation of epa and a 67% increase in the amount of cell-associated radiolabeled epa. furthermore, we observed 28% elevated cellular level of tag in epa-incubated cos-1 cells overexpressing  xxxg49xxx . the present study provides new information about acs as an important enzyme for epa-induced apoptosis in ramos cells. our data offer a potential mechanism that may explain the effect of dietary marine n-3 pufa on growth of certain malignant cells.
