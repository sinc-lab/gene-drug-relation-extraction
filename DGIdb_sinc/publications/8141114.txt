 xxxd1924xxx  mesylate (mdl 73,147ef), a new serotonin re-
ceptor (5-ht;) antagonist was administered to 164 cancer
patients naive or nonnaive to chemotherapy, in single, rising
doses of 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 mg iv 15 minutes prior to an
infusion of cisplatin. the severity of nausea and number of
episodes of emesis were recorded during the 24-hour period
following cisplatin administration. there were significant dif-
ferences between the dose groups, sex, and naive and non-
naive patients. there were also significant  xxxd1924xxx  dose-
dependent differences for no emesis (p = .01), less than 3
emetic episodes (p = .01), time-to-onset of nausea (p = .04),
and time-to-onset of emesis (p = .003). the severity of symp-
toms was greater for females, for patients with previous che-
motherapy, and with shorter duration of cisplatin infusion.
adjustment for these variables and the study center reduced
the associations between the dose of  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate and
the outcome variables. the principal adverse events were
headache (11%) and diarrhea (6%).  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate was
well tolerated: a single dose of 40 or 50 mg controlled acute
nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic che-
motherapy in the majority, in particular in chemotherapy-
naive and male patients. in conclusion, 50 mg and a larger

dose merit study in controlled trials with stratification for
sex and previous chemotherapy.

key words: 5-hydroxytryptamine; receptor antagonist—
cisplatin—antiemetic—chemotherapy-induced emesis—
clinical trial.

nausea and vomiting are the major adverse events
of cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with cancer (1).
the emetogenicity of chemotherapy varies with the
regimen, dosage, and rate of administration (2) and
may be worse in females (3) and in patients who have
previously received chemotherapy (3,4).

cisplatin is regarded as one of the most emetogenic
chemotherapeutic agents. of patients given cisplatin
> 50 mg/m’, very few avoid nausea and vomiting in
the absence of pretreatment with antiemetic drugs (5-
7). two different types of cisplatin-induced nausea and
vomiting are recognized: acute, arbitrarily defined as
symptoms within the first 24 hours, and delayed, which
peaks between 48 and 72 hours and can last for a week
or more (8). when the infusion time of cisplatin is
prolonged or the dose is given over several days, tol-
erance is better (9).

mdl 72,222, the first selective 5-hydroxytrypta-
mine; (5-ht;) receptor antagonist discovered (10), and
 xxxd3451xxx  were shown to prevent cisplatin-induced
emesis in the ferret (11,12). subsequent clinical trials
with mdl 72,222 (13), and other 5-ht; antagonists
98 t. conroy et al.

such as ondansetron (14), granisetron (15), and tro-
pisetron showed good control of nausea and vomiting
in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or radio-
therapy.

 xxxd1924xxx  mesylate (mdl 73,147ef) is a new 5-
ht; receptor antagonist which is more potent than
mdl 72,222 (16,17). ina study of single, rising intra-
venous doses 1-30 mg in healthy subjects,  xxxd1924xxx 
mesylate was well tolerated and doses of 10, 20, and
30 mg caused significant inhibition of the flare response
to intradermal 5-ht consistent with antagonism at 5-
ht; receptors (18). therefore, these three doses, plus
two larger doses of 40 and 50 mg, were chosen for the
first clinical study to assess the safety and acute anti-
emetic effect of single, rising doses of intravenous dol-
asetron mesylate in cancer patients requiring cisplatin
> 50 mg/m’.

materials and methods

study design

this study was open, uncontrolled, multicentric (7
= 12), dose-rising in design and approved by the local
ethics committee in each participating country. written
informed consent was obtained from each patient. this
study was conducted between august 1989 and august
1991.

patients

the inclusion criteria were: either sex; age 18-75
years; histologically confirmed malignant cancer, cis-
 xxxd2923xxx  = 50 mg/m? infused over less than 8 hours either
alone or as part of a regimen from which cisplatin was
administered first; naive or nonnaive to chemotherapy,
no chemotherapy in the previous 3 days; inpatients for
at least 24 hours during and after chemotherapy: = 50%
on the karnofsky scale: white cell count = 4.10°/l;
platelets > 120.10°/l; serum creatinine < 15 mg/l.
the exclusion criteria were cerebral metastases; estab-
lished antiemetic therapy in the 12 hours prior to cis-
 xxxd2923xxx ; anticipatory nausea and vomiting.

study treatments

patients received intravenously a single dose of do-
lasetron mesylate 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 mg over 1-2
minutes. each investigator was required to treat three
different patients for each of the five dose-groups, com-
mencing with the 10-mg dose (15 patients per center).
larger doses were only studied if previous, smaller
doses were well-tolerated by the previous three patients
in each center. a protocol amendment allowed re-
cruitment of 8 additional new patients in two centers,
the magnitude of the dose, beginning at 20 mg, being
at the discretion of the investigator.

am j clin oncol (cct), vol. 17, no. 2, 1994

infusion of cisplatin = 50 mg/m? was started 15
minutes after the administration of  xxxd1924xxx  mesyl-
ate. other chemotherapeutic agents were administered
after cisplatin in an order and at rates of infusion ac-
cording to local practice. escape medication with es-
tablished antiemetic drugs was permitted 6 hours after
cisplatin was given if  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate did not ad-
equately control nausea and vomiting.

study assessments

efficacy parameters of nausea and vomiting were
monitored for 24 hours after the start of cisplatin.
nausea was assessed at regular intervals by the patient
with a series of visual-analogue scales (vas; 0 to 100
mm) and labeled at the two extremes “no nausea” and
“nausea as bad as it could be”. at 12 hours and 24
hours after the start of cisplatin, the investigator ques-
tioned the patient about the maximum severity (none,
mild, moderate, severe) and duration of nausea in the
previous 12 hours. the number of episodes of emesis
and/or retching within each hour of the 24-hour ob-
servation period were recorded. retching was regarded
as an episode of emesis. the time of the first episode
of emesis was also recorded. heart rate and blood pres-
sure were monitored, and routine safety tests of blood
and urine were done before, 24 hours after, and be-
tween 3 and 7 days after administration of  xxxd1924xxx 
mesylate. in one center, 24-hour electrocardiogram
holter monitoring was performed in all the patients
and was repeated during a subsequent identical course
of chemotherapy without  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate. adverse
events were recorded.

data analysis

the overall goal was to assess whether any effects of
 xxxd1924xxx  mesylate were dose-dependent. two sets of
response variables, primary and secondary, were used
to compare the efficacy of five doses of  xxxd1924xxx 
mesylate. primary response variables were no emetic
episodes and no nausea. secondary response variables
were two or fewer emetic episodes, none or mild nau-
sea, time-to-onset of nausea, time-to-onset of vomiting,
maximum vas measurement for nausea and duration
of nausea. complete control was defined as no emesis
in the 24-hour study: major control, 2 or fewer emetic
episodes; minor control, 3-5 episodes, and treatment
failure, more than 5 episodes.

for dichotomous response variables, comparisons
between dose groups were made in order to identify
any differences which could bias dose-response results.
dose-group comparisons were made for sex, age, pre-
vious chemotherapy, dose of cisplatin, the duration of
cisplatin infusion and center. the association between
these background variables and response variables was
 xxxd1924xxx  for acute cisplatin-induced emesis 99

then examined so that comparisons between dose and
response variables could be adjusted to avoid bias.
multiple between-dose contrasts were made for the
primary and secondary response variables for which
the overall dose comparison was statistically significant.
linear trend contrasts using rank scores were examined
in order to determine whether any dose-dependent dif-
ference exhibited this type of trend. main effects used
for all response variables were dose and center and
adjustment for other background variables was made
if a significant background variable by response rela-
tionship was found. heart rate, blood pressure, routine
tests of blood and urine, and adverse events data were
analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. a
probability of p < .05 was taken to indicate significance.

results
demographic data

a total of 164 patients, 40% females, were entered
by 12 centers. mean age was 52 years (table 1). the
distribution of patients by sex varied significantly across
the dose groups (global p = .007); the 10-mg group had
the highest percentage of females (60%). the dose of
10 mg was not given in three centers because of un-
favorable results obtained. there were 30, 39, 36, 34,
and 25 patients for the 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-mg
dose groups, respectively. the primary sites of cancer
were genitourinary tract, 34% of patients, head and
neck, 21%; gastrointestinal tract, 15%; lung, 13%;
breast, 7%; bone, 4%; other, 4%; unknown, 2%. the
percentage of patients treated previously with cytotoxic
chemotherapy varied significantly across the dose
groups (global p = .006) and ranged from 33% for the
30-mg group to 77% for the !0-mg group.

all patients received cisplatin. in one center, 14 pa-
tients received 40 mg/m’ cisplatin according to a pro-
tocol amendment for this center; the median dose was
100 mg/m? (range: 40-150), and the mean infusion

time was 2 hours (standard deviation: 1.6). also 143
patients received from | to 3 other chemotherapeutic
agents (median: 1). the most frequently used agents
were 5-fluorouracil, 34% of patients; etoposide, 21%;
cyclophosphamide, 20%; doxorubicin, 12%; ifosfamide,
7%; carboplatin, 7%. there were no significant differ-
ences between the dose groups with respect to age, dose
of cisplatin, and duration of cisplatin infusion.

efficacy

control of nausea and emesis throughout the 24-
hour period was best in the groups who received the
higher doses of  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate. the control of
emesis shows that the 10-mg group fared worst (only
17% did not vomit) and that the best results were
achieved with the higher doses (table 2). overall, the
40- and 50-mg doses prevented emesis in 54% of pa-
tients achieving major control in 73%.

the percentages of patients completely controlled
for nausea and vomiting were 17, 46, 39, 47, and 64
for doses from 10 to 50 mg, respectively (table 2). the
difference between the doses of  xxxd1924xxx  was signif-
icant (p = .01). similarly, the percentages of patients
with major control for the 10- to 50-mg groups were
33, 64, 58, 74, and 72, and this difference too was sig-
nificant (p = .01). corresponding percentages for none
or mild nausea were 36, 58, 56, 68, and 71 however
was not significant (p = .07). mean times-to-onset of
nausea were 5.1, 7.4, 10.1, 7.4, and 10.0 hours for the
10- to 50-mg groups, respectively, and this difference
was significant (p < .04). corresponding mean times-
to-onset of vomiting were 4.0, 8.5, 10.5, 11.1, and 7.3
h, respectively. this difference was dose-dependent (p
= ,003).

chemotherapy-naive patients tended to have better
results (fig. |) than patients with previous chemother-
apy. the differences were significant for no emesis, less
than 3 emesis episodes, time-to-onset of nausea and

time-to-first emetic episode. women tended to expe-
rience nausea of greater severity and to vomit more
frequently than men (fig. 2). the differences were sig-
nificant for no emesis, no nausea and none or mild
nausea. time-to-onset of nausea and time-to-first
emetic episode increased in relation to the duration of
cisplatin infusion. there were significant or near-
significant differences between centers for no emesis,
no nausea, none or mild nausea, and duration of
nausea.

adjustment for background by response relation-
ships which were significant or approached significance
(sex, previous chemotherapy, duration of cisplatin in-
fusion and center) tended to reduce the associations
between  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate dose and the response
variables. this suggests that the uneven distribution of

background variables (e.g., highest percentage of
women and patients previously exposed to chemo-
therapy were in the 10-mg dose group) was partially
responsible for the significant dose-dependent effects
noted. adjustment for center, sex, and previous che-
motherapy produced significant differences between
 xxxd1924xxx  mesylate 10 mg and the 4 other doses (cor-
rected p < .05) with respect to number of vomits. there
were no significant differences between any other pair
of doses, although the linear trend contrast for numbers
of episodes of emesis was highly significant (p = .017).

established antiemetic therapy as escape medication
was administered to 35 patients (21.3%). the percent-
age of patients given escape medication across the doses
were 37%, 18%, 20%, 21%, and 12% for the 10-, 20-,
30-, 40-, and 50-mg dose groups, respectively. thus,

there was a trend (p < .21) toward less use of escape
medication as the dose of  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate was in-
creased. furthermore, escape medication tended to be
used later in the 24-hour period with the higher doses
of  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate (fig. 3).

of the 164 patients entered in this study, 100 (61%)
received high-dose cisplatin, arbitrarily defined as = 100
mg/m?, the distribution of this subset of patients per
dose-group is indicated in table |. the percentages of
patients with no vomiting were 20%, 50%, 27%, 48%,
and 67% for the 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-mg dose
groups, respectively (fig. 4). corresponding percentages
for none or mild nausea were 40%, 55%, 50%, 62%,
and 71%, respectively (table 2). the percentages of
patients given escape medication and the efficacy results
in this subset were similar to those for the full set of
patients.

safety and tolerance

measurement of heart rate and blood pressure were
unaffected for all of the  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate dose
groups. holter tape monitoring did not show any sig-
nificant change for heart rate, except normal circadian
variation. the main changes observed in the routine
blood safety tests were slight falls in posttreatment red
blood cell indices and greater falls, particularly at 3-7
days, in posttreatment white blood cell counts. changes
in overall mean values for liver function tests, renal
function tests,  xxxd3472xxx  tests, and other tests, were small
or inconsistent. when mean values for the five dose
groups were examined, changes at 24 hours or 3-7 days
did not appear  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate dose-dependent.

for 37 (23%) of the 164 patients, 54 adverse events
were reported; 12 patients had more than one event.
the main adverse reaction was headache (11.0%) be-
ginning at the 20-mg dose level. other side effects in-
cluded diarrhea (6.1%), fatigue (1.8%), hot flushes
(1.2%), injection-site pain/reaction (1.2%), dry mouth
(1.2%), and fever (1.2%), and were not dose-related.

discussion

in placebo-controlled studies of antiemetic therapies,
cisplatin = 50 mg/m? induced acute emesis in all but
a small minority of patients pretreated with placebo
(5-7). moreover, clear differences in vomiting were
observed between groups pretreated with  xxxd1924xxx 
mesylate 10 and 50 mg, thus evidencing its prophylactic
effect on acute emesis induced by high-dose cisplatin.
the best results were achieved with the 40- and 50-mg
doses, which yielded complete control in 54% of pa-
tients and major control in 73%. in the subset of pa-
tients given cisplatin > 100 mg/m? it was still the 40-
and 50-mg doses that obtained the best antiemetic ef-
fects. furthermore, escape antiemetic therapy was used
for a lesser number of patients in the 50-mg dose group.
nausea also tended to be better controlled as the dose
was increased. again, the 50-mg dose of  xxxd1924xxx 
mesylate gave the best control with 58% of patients,
producing no nausea. nausea, however, is a subjective
symptom and more difficult to quantify than emesis
(19). time-to-onset of nausea, time-to-first emetic
episode, and maximum vas score all showed similar
trends to the primary response variables.

am j clin oncol (cct), vol. 17, no. 2, 1994

the findings that chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting were more frequent or worse in patients pre-
viously exposed to chemotherapy and in females were
expected from studies with mdl 72,222 (13) and from
the literature (3,4). the better tolerance of cisplatin
when the infusion time was prolonged has also been
reported elsewhere (9). thus, the influence of back-
ground variables on outcome measures needs to be
taken into account in the design of studies with 5-ht;
antagonists for well-matched dose groups.

 xxxd1924xxx  mesylate was well tolerated. the prin-
cipal adverse events, headache and diarrhea, were not
dose-dependent and in general were not troublesome.
this adverse event profile is similar to that reported
for clinical trials with ondansetron (20) and granisetron
(21). diarrhea is a common toxicity with cisplatin and
5-fluorouracil given as single agents or in combination
(22). the changes in blood counts are entirely consis-
tent with chemotherapy. there have been no changes
of clinical relevance in various biologic parameters in
healthy volunteers following administration of single
intravenous doses of  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate up to 30 mg
(18). this study was open and not randomized and
attracted a heterogeneous population of patients such
that some dose-groups had proportionally more pa-
tients at greater risk of emesis, for example, the 10-mg
dose group (60% female, 77% previously exposed to
chemotherapy). this highlights the need for stratifi-
cation of background variables in order to achieve well-
matched groups. results between centers varied sig-
nificantly showing that center-specific factors such as
surroundings and nursing care as well as types of cancer
treated probably have an impact on outcome in studies
of antiemetics. therefore, a spread of centers within
and between countries may be desirable.

this study shows that pretreatment with a single dose
of intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate is capable of pre-
venting or controlling cisplatin-induced acute nausea
and vomiting in a majority of cancer patients. pre-
treatment with a dose of 10 mg may be inadequate,
but higher doses up to 50 mg does control symptoms,
especially in patients naive to chemotherapy and in
males. a larger dose might further improve the man-
agement of patients treated with cisplatin alone or in
combination.  xxxd1924xxx  mesylate was well tolerated
and was not associated with any serious adverse events.
