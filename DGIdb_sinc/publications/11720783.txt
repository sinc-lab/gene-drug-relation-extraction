abstractöa protective capacity of transforming growth factor-l1 (tgf-l1) against various insults inducing neurone cell
death in vitro and in vivo has been well established. we have recently shown the rapid up-regulation and persistent
expression of tgf-l1 in surviving ca1 pyramidal cells after cerebral ischemia suggesting an endogenous mechanism of
neuroprotection by this multifunctional cytokine. in the present study, we demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of  xxxd1714xxx , a lipophilic l2 -adrenoceptor agonist, caused an increase in tgf-l1 expression in non-ischemic rats
and further enhanced tgf-l1 protein levels in rat ca1 pyramidal neurones after transient forebrain ischemia. in the
hippocampus neuroprotection by  xxxd1714xxx  (0.5 mg/kg) was accompanied by increased tgf-l1 immunoreactivity as
early  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx  h, and remained elevated up to 2 days after ischemia. the corresponding increased tgf-l1 mrna levels after
ischemia were not further enhanced by  xxxd1714xxx , suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of tgf-l1 protein after
l2 -adrenoceptor stimulation. in saline-treated rats latent tgf-l-binding protein-1 (ltbp-1) immunoreactivity was
moderately elevated 3 and 6 h after ischemia, and returned to control levels after 1 day of reperfusion. in parallel
with the up-regulation of tgf-l1 immunoreactivity, ltbp-1 levels in the hippocampus were considerably increased
by  xxxd1714xxx  from 3 h to 2 days after ischemia.
our data demonstrate a concomitant increase in ltbp-1 and tgf-l1 expression in the ischemic hippocampus after
stimulation of l2 -adrenoceptors. ß 2001 ibro. published by elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

brain tissue after focal and global ischemia (gross et al.,
1993; henrich-noack et al., 1996; prehn et al., 1993b).
these neuroprotective e¡ects of tgf-l1 may be mediated by its capacity of maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, regulating calcium homeostasis,
up-regulating anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 (prehn et al.,
1994; tomoda et al., 1996), and increasing the ratio of
 xxxg251xxx  to bcl-xs (kim et al., 1998). in addition, antiin£ammatory e¡ects (finch et al., 1993; weiss et al.,
1999) and angiogenesis (gleizes and rifkin, 1999;
kumar-siingh et al., 1999) caused by tgf-l1 may be
involved in limiting the extent of ischemic damage.
it has been documented that tgf-l1 is secreted from
cells in a latent form that cannot interact with cell surface tgf-l receptors. the small latent complex consists
of the  xxxg2269xxx   xxxg2270xxx  (lap, 75 kda) and the
mature tgf-l homodimer (25 kda). this small latent
complex binds latent tgf-l-binding protein-1 (ltbp-1)
to form a large latent complex. release of tgf-l1 from
the latent complex is a major regulatory step for its biological activity. ltbps are multidomain glycoproteins
with a molecular weight ranging from 125 to 240 kda.
four ltbp genes (ltbp-1, -2, -3, -4) have been identi¢ed (kanzaki et al., 1990; morën et al., 1994; saharinen
et al., 1998; yin et al., 1995), and all appear capable of

transforming growth factor-l1 (tgf-l1) is a cytokine
widely distributed in various tissues. in the cns, tgfl1 is expressed in neurones, astrocytes and microglia
(knuckey et al., 1996; krieglstein et al., 1998;
krieglstein and unsicker, 1994). beyond its function
in the modulation of cell growth and di¡erentiation
(roberts and sporn, 1993), tgf-l1 has been shown to
play a role in pathological processes, e.g. in£ammation
and immune responses, tissue repair and wound healing,
and neurodegeneration (flanders et al., 1998; krieglstein
and krieglstein, 1997). tgf-l1 prevented neurone death
induced by various insults, including glutamate, cyanide
or amyloid-l-peptide in vitro (buisson et al., 1998; chao
et al., 1994; krieglstein and unsicker, 1994; prehn et al.,
1993a; prehn et al., 1996), and reduced the damage of

forming a large latent complex with tgf-l1. in addition, they may also occur in a free, uncomplexed form
(morën et al., 1994). ltbp-1 is the best characterised
isoform of the ltbp family. beside its function as a
structural matrix protein (dallas et al., 1995), it may
facilitate the secretion of latent tgf-l1 (miyazono
and heldin, 1989), and target the latent tgf-l1 to the
extracellular matrix, thereby regulating the availability of
bioactive tgf-l1 (mangasser-stephan and gressner,
1999; pedrozo et al., 1999). furthermore, a direct
involvement of ltbp-1 in tgf-l1 activation has been
suggested (flaumenhaft et al., 1993; nunes et al., 1997;
sinha et al., 1998). however, very little is known about
the expression and the function of ltbp-1 in the brain.
we reported recently that tgf-l1 mrna levels in
hippocampal ca1 neurones were increased after transient forebrain ischemia (tfi) accompanied by enhanced
tgf-l1 immunoreactivity (ir) (zhu et al., 2000). however, ischemia-mediated elevation of tgf-l1 expression
appeared moderate and transient, and seemed to be
insu¤cient to prevent the massive neurone death in the
hippocampus after ischemia. our previous work established neuroprotective e¡ects by the l2 -adrenoceptor
agonist  xxxd1714xxx  in vitro and in vivo that were accompanied by induction of  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf)
(culmsee et al., 1999a; culmsee et al., 1999b; semkova
et al., 1994; semkova et al., 1996; zhu et al., 1998). in
the present study, we attempted to test whether l2 -adrenoceptor stimulation by  xxxd1714xxx  could achieve induction of tgf-l1 protein in the vulnerable hippocampus
after ischemia.

perfused with saline followed by 4% phosphate-bu¡ered formalin 3 h after injection of  xxxd1714xxx  and 3 h, 6 h, 24 h and
48 h after ischemia. the rat brains were embedded in para¤n,
and coronal sections (5 wm) were cut at the hippocampal level
(n = 3 or 4 per group at each time point).
immunohistochemistry
the speci¢city of the tgf-l1 ir signal in tissue sections has
been characterised by testing the primary anti-tgf-l1 antibody
(santa cruz, heidelberg, germany) in immunoblots, by preabsorption of the antibody with a puri¢ed tgf-l1 blocking
peptide (santa cruz), and by applying a non-speci¢c igg
instead of speci¢c antibody (zhu et al., 2000). immunostaining
procedures were similar to those described previously (zhu et
al., 2000). in brief, brain sections were depara¤nised, washed
with tris-bu¡ered saline (tbs), and unspeci¢c binding was
blocked by a solution of 1% bsa in phosphate-bu¡ered saline
(pbs). the sections were then incubated with either a polyclonal
rabbit anti-tgf-l1 antibody (1:20 dilution), or a polyclonal
rabbit anti-ltbp-1 antibody (1:50 dilution, pharmingen, hamburg, germany) for 90 min at 37³c followed by exposure to the
secondary antibody and alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline
phosphatase (apaap) complex (apaap kit, dako, hamburg,
germany). finally, sections were counter-stained with mayer's
hemalaun solution for 5 min. in the negative control, the sections were incubated with non-speci¢c rabbit igg (dako, hamburg, germany) at a concentration identical to the primary
antibodies.
for double staining the sections were ¢rst incubated with
polyclonal anti-tgf-l1 or anti-ltbp-1 antibodies and secondary antibodies as described above, followed by an incubation
with a monoclonal anti-neun antibody (1:300 dilution; chem-

experimental procedures

tfi
tfi was performed in male wistar rats (n = 86, 300^350 g,
charles river, germany) as described previously (zhu et al.,
1998). in brief, the rats were fasted overnight with free access
to water and anaesthetised with halothane (1.5%) in a mixture
of n2 o/o2 (70%/30%). rectal and skull temperature were maintained between 37.0 and 37.5³c by a temperature control feedback system (technical scienti¢c equipment, germany).
ischemia was induced for 10 min by clamping both common
carotid arteries, combined with a decrease in the mean arterial
blood pressure to 40 mm hg by  xxxd3439xxx  camphor sulphonate (5 mg/kg, i.v.) and central venous exsanguination. after
10 min the clips were removed and the blood which had been
withdrawn was rapidly re-injected. arterial ph, pco2 , po2 ,
mean arterial blood pressure and plasma glucose concentration
were measured before and after ischemia. after surgery, the
animals were kept at an environmental temperature of 30³c
for 2 h and then at 23³c in their home cages. all experimental
procedures involving animals were approved by the government
ethics committee, and all e¡orts were made to minimise su¡ering
and number of the rats used.
according to our previous dose^response study, 0.5 mg/kg of
 xxxd1714xxx  intraperitoneally administered 3 h before tfi was
most e¡ective to protect neurones against ischemic damage
without in£uence on blood pressure and blood glucose levels
(zhu et al., 1998). therefore, the same treatment was applied
in the present study. the e¡ect of  xxxd1714xxx  on tgf-l1
expression was examined in both non-ischemic and ischemic
rats. for immunohistochemistry, rats were deeply anaesthetised
with a lethal dosage of chloral hydrate and then transcardially

sections with tbs, the anti-mouse igg biotin conjugate was
added to the cells followed by the £uorescein avidin d (fitc)
reaction.
western blotting
the hippocampi of saline- or  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats were
removed at 6 h and 24 h after tfi (n = 3 per group at each
time point), and the tissues were homogenised in a lysis bu¡er
containing 10% glycerol, 3%  xxxd3215xxx  (sds), 0.5
m tris, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl £uoride (pmsf), 1 wm
calpain-inhibitor i and 7 wg/ml  xxxd207xxx . after centrifugation (15 000ug, 10 min, 4³c) the protein content of the supernatant was measured by a bca kit (pierce, rockford, il,
usa). an equivalent amount of protein (8 wg) from each sample was loaded onto a 4^15% gradient sds^polyacrylamide gel
(amersham pharmacia biotech, uppsala, sweden) and separated under non-reducing conditions. following electrophoresis,
the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose transfer membrane. the membrane was washed twice in tbs and incubated
in blocking bu¡er (5% non-fat dry milk in tbs) for 2 h. the
blots were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal ltbp-1 primary antibodies (1:200, pharmingen, hamburg, germany)
overnight at room temperature. after washing the membrane
with 0.1% tween-20 in tbs, the blots were incubated with an
alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-rabbit igg, (1:5000) for 1 h
at room temperature. the signals were visualised by nbt/bcip
(sigma, deisenhofen, germany). to demonstrate that equal
amounts of protein were loaded to the gel, k-tubulin was determined by western blotting. the integrated optical density (iod)
of ltbp-1 and k-tubulin signals was semi-quanti¢ed. the ratio
of iodltbpÿ1 and iodkÿtubulin was calculated. the data were
given as means þ s.d. of the percentage ratio of the sham-operation.

hippocampal ca1 sub¢eld as indicated by the arrows
in non-ischemic rats (fig. 1a). administration of  xxxd1714xxx  to non-ischemic rats caused an increase in tgfl1 expression in this subregion (fig. 1b).
in sham-operated rats (fig. 2a), tgf-l1 immunosignals were mostly located in the cytoplasm of the pyramidal cells, whereas no signal was detectable in negative
control sections which were incubated with non-speci¢c
igg instead of tgf-l1 antibody (fig. 2b). pre-incubation of the tgf-l1 antibody with tgf-l1 blocking peptide abolished tgf-l1 ir in the ca1 region (data not
shown). tgf-l1 ir increased 3 h and 6 h after tfi
(fig. 2c, e), returned to basal levels at 24 h (fig. 2g),
and further decreased until 48 h after ischemia (fig. 2i).
the l2 -adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd1714xxx  markedly
enhanced tgf-l1 ir 3 h and up to 48 h after reperfusion
as compared to saline-treated animals (fig. 2d, f, h, j).
after  xxxd1714xxx  treatment, increased tgf-l1 ir was
detected in cell bodies and processes of hippocampal
neurones and in extracellular spaces around the cell
bodies. notably, enhanced tgf-l1 ir in ca1 pyramidal
cells in  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats was associated with neuronal survival up to 48 h after reperfusion (fig. 2j),
whereas neurones in the hippocampal ca1 sub¢eld
of saline-treated controls already became damaged
(fig. 2i). using anti-tgf-l1 and anti-neun antibodies
for double staining the localisation of tgf-l1 ir was
con¢rmed in ca1 pyramidal neurones after  xxxd1714xxx 
treatment (fig. 3a-a,b).

tgf-l1 mrna expression in the hippocampus

the hippocampal tissue was quickly removed 3 h, 6 h, 24 h,
48 h and 96 h after ischemia, and frozen at 380³c (n = 3 or 4 per
group at each time point). total rna was extracted from the
tissue samples using the rneasy total rna kit (qiagen,
hilden, germany). in brief, after homogenising the tissue in
lysis bu¡er, total rna was precipitated in 70% ethanol. after
centrifugation (15 000 r.p.m., 15 s) the rna pellet was washed
with rw1 and rpe bu¡ers, and eluted by water. the eluate
was incubated with rnase-free dnase at 37³c for 15 min.
precipitation, washing and elution procedures were repeated
once again as described above. the mrna in 2.5 wg total
rna was reverse-transcribed using oligo-dt primers in reaction
bu¡er for 1 h at 37³c. tgf-l1 cdna (l-actin cdna) was
ampli¢ed by 29 (26) cycles at 95³c for 30 s, 60³c (42³c) for
60 s and 72³c for 120 s followed by a ¢nal extension step of 10
min at 72³c. the tgf-l1 primer sets were 5p-tgg acc gca

were subjected to electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel containing
ethidium bromide. the intensity of the tgf-l1 mrna
signals were semi-quanti¢ed by a image analysis programme
(scanalysis, ebersberg, germany).

to evaluate whether  xxxd1714xxx  enhanced tgf-l1
levels by induction of mrna synthesis, rt-pcr was
performed at di¡erent time points after ischemia. in
agreement with our previous results (zhu et al., 2000),
tgf-l1 mrna levels were up-regulated in the hippocampus from 3 h to 96 h after ischemia.  xxxd1714xxx 
treatment increased tgf-l1 mrna levels in the hippocampus of saline-treated, non-ischemic rats. however,
semi-quanti¢cation of the rt-pcr signals comparing
hippocampal tgf-l1 mrna levels of  xxxd1714xxx - and
saline-treated animals did not show statistical signi¢cance at any time point after tfi (fig. 4b).

(fig. 5j). evaluation of the brain sections at low magni¢cation revealed that the enhanced ltbp-1 ir was
present in the hippocampal ca1-2 sub¢eld as well as
in the cingulum (fig. 5l).
as shown in fig. 6a, immunoblot analysis con¢rmed
that ltbp-1 protein levels were enhanced 6 h after tfi
in the hippocampus of saline-treated rats and returned to
control levels after 24 h of reperfusion. furthermore,
hippocampal ltbp-1 levels were increased by  xxxd1714xxx  at 6 h after ischemia and maintained elevated up
to 24 h as compared to saline-treated animals, consistent
with the results obtained by immunostaining. the
changes in ltbp-1 expression after ischemia and after
drug treatment were con¢rmed by using the control
western blotting of k-tubulin (fig. 6b) and the semiquanti¢cation of the blots (fig. 6c).

discussion

the present study showed that systemic administration
of the l2 -adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd1714xxx  e¡ectively
increased tgf-l1 expression in both non-ischemic and
ischemic rat hippocampus, while tgf-l1 mrna level

nsc 5198 7-11-01

was not signi¢cantly in£uenced by  xxxd1714xxx  after
ischemia. the increase in tgf-l1 ir in the hippocampus
by  xxxd1714xxx  was accompanied by the up-regulation of
ltbp-1 expression after ischemia, suggesting a possible
relationship between these two proteins after stimulation
of l2 -adrenoceptors by  xxxd1714xxx .
data obtained in our laboratory and by others established a protective role of tgf-l1 against ischemic brain
damage. pang et al. (1999) recently reported that overexpression of tgf-l1 in mouse brain diminished the
infarct volume after transient focal cerebral ischemia.
moreover, neutralisation of endogenous tgf-l1 in rat
brain accelerated brain damage following excitotoxic or
ischemic injury (ruocco et al., 1999). therefore, it is
conceivable that an increase in tgf-l1 level in adult
brain tissue may support the neuronal survival after
ischemic injury, although tgf-l1 shows di¡erent e¡ects
in other types of cells and tissues (xiao et al., 1997),
under other pathological conditions (de luca et al.,
1996), and in embryonic brain (krieglstein et al., 2000).
in the present study, the expression of tgf-l1 in the
hippocampus was increased by  xxxd1714xxx , and meanwhile the intact morphology of the neurones in the hippocampus was preserved in  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats up to
2 days after ischemia. in comparison, about 50% of neurones in the hippocampal ca1 sub¢eld of saline-treated
controls were already damaged 2 days after ischemia.

these data suggest that induction of tgf-l1 in the
hippocampal ca1 sub¢eld may contribute to the neuroprotective e¡ect of  xxxd1714xxx .
tgf-l1 has been shown to induce other growth factors, e.g. ngf (lindholm et al., 1990), to synergistically
act with those factors to support neuronal survival
(krieglstein et al., 1998), to up-regulate the expression

of the anti-apoptotic oncoprotein bcl-2 (prehn et al.,
1994), and to inhibit the cytotoxicity of tnf-k
(chang, 1995). interestingly, in models of cerebral ischemia in rodents neuroprotection by  xxxd1714xxx  was
accompanied by the increase in ngf protein (culmsee
et al., 1999a; zhu et al., 1998; zhu and krieglstein,
1999). moreover,  xxxd1714xxx  elevated bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx

protein levels (zhu et al., 1999) and reduced the release
of cytotoxic tnf-k (izenoud et al., 1999), hence supporting anti-apoptotic signalling in the hippocampus following tfi. therefore, tgf-l1 induced in the ischemic
hippocampus by  xxxd1714xxx  may contribute to the neuroprotective signalling after l2 -adrenoceptor stimulation.
in agreement with our previous results in rat models of
focal and global ischemia, we found increased tgf-l1
mrna levels in the hippocampus after tfi. however,
semi-quantitative analysis comparing hippocampal tgfl1 mrna levels between  xxxd1714xxx - and saline-treated
animals did not show statistical signi¢cance at any time
point after tfi. this ¢nding is partly di¡erent to our
observation in a rat model of focal ischemia, where  xxxd1714xxx  transiently increased the expression of tgf-l1
mrna in the hippocampus, but not in the cortex. however, rats of a di¡erent strain were used in the previous
study, and the two models of ischemia were considerably
di¡erent, as permanent focal ischemia did not cause any
morphological changes in the hippocampus, while pronounced neurone death was induced in this region by
tfi.
nevertheless, as we have mentioned before, one key
step for the regulation of tgf-l1 activity is the control
of its conversion from the latent precursor to the biologically active form. post-translational modulation of
tgf-l1 expression, e.g. acceleration of the activation
step, might be the way to increase the level of bioactive

nsc 5198 7-11-01

tgf-l1 more e¤ciently than that in the transcriptional
level, because the availability of bioactive tgf-l1
mainly depends on the secretion and activation steps.
tgf-l expression independent of its de novo synthesis
has also been previously reported in hepatic parenchymal
cells (roth et al., 1998). although the regulation of
tgf-l1 activation in vivo is not well understood, several
processes have been identi¢ed in vitro, including acidi¢cation (wake¢eld et al., 1987), proteolysis (lyons et al.,
1990), generation of thrombospondin (schultz-cherry
and murphy-ullrich, 1993) and plasmin (nunes et al.,
1998), or removal of carbohydrate structures from
tgf-l1 (miyazono et al., 1991). in addition, published
data suggest the requirement of ltbp-1 for secretion
and activation of tgf-l and for induction of its biological activity (flaumenhaft et al., 1993; miyazono et al.,
1991; mizoi et al., 1993; nakajima et al., 1997). in this
study, we reported for the ¢rst time that ltbp-1 ir was
temporarily up-regulated in the hippocampus 3 h and 6 h
after tfi.  xxxd1714xxx  further elevated ltbp-1 protein
levels at 3 h and up to 48 h after tfi. interestingly, this
increase in ltbp-1 ir correlated with the increase in
tgf-l1 ir in the hippocampus both after tfi and
after  xxxd1714xxx  treatment. moreover, tgf-l1 ir in
sham-operated and in saline-treated controls was predominantly located in the cytoplasm of the pyramidal
neurones (fig. 2a, c, e, g, i), while tgf-l1 ir in the
hippocampus of  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats intensively

l2 -adrenoceptor stimulation enhances ltbp-1 and tgf-l1 ir

appeared in both cytoplasm and the extracellular side of
the pyramidal neurones (fig. 2d, f, h, j), suggesting an
increased amount of available tgf-l1 protein around
the cell surface. based on the idea that ltbp-1 facilitates
tgf-l1 secretion and activation, we suggest that
increased ltbp-1 levels by  xxxd1714xxx  contribute to
the elevation of tgf-l1 expression in hippocampal neurones.
in addition to the regulatory e¡ects of ltbp-1 on
tgf-l1 secretion and activation, krohn (krohn, 1999)
recently reported an up-regulation of the rat ltbp-2
homologue mrna in c6 glioma cells and cortical astrocytes by tgf-l1, causing activation and ampli¢cation of
tgf-l-signalling in an autocrine loop. similarly, tgfl1 was able to elevate the transcription of ltbp-1 and
-2 (ahmed et al., 1998; dallas et al., 1994). overall, these
data suggest possible regulatory interactions of ltbp-1
and tgf-l1 after  xxxd1714xxx  treatment. however,

further studies have to elucidate whether ltbp-l1
expression is directly enhanced due to stimulation of
l2 -adrenoceptors or whether tgf-l1 is involved in this
e¡ect.
in conclusion, we demonstrated that ltbp-1 expression is increased in rat hippocampus after ischemia. the
expression of ltbp-1 could be further elevated in this
region concomitantly with the enhanced tgf-l1 level
by the lipophilic l2 -adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd1714xxx 
after tfi. these results indicate that the expression of
tgf-l1 and ltbp-1 in ischemic rat hippocampus can
be modulated by pharmacological intervention.
