background: decreased arterial compliance (ac) is
considered an early marker of vascular wall damage. hypertension gradually decreases arterial compliance. we
studied whether treatment with the angiotensin type 1
(at1) antagonist  xxxd3487xxx  will affect ac in patients with
essential hypertension (eh).
methods: twenty-two patients with eh, 6 men and 16
women, mean age 58.7 ⫾ 4.1 years, without overt target
organ damage were included. antihypertensive medications were withdrawn for 3 weeks,  xxxd3487xxx  was given at
80- and 160-mg doses. the ac, blood pressure (bp),
blood, and urine were measured monthly. large (c1) and
small (c2) ac were derived from radial artery waveforms,
obtained using a calibrated tonometer (model cr-2000,
hdi inc., eagan, mn).
results: after 3 months, systolic bp decreased from
172 ⫾ 17 to 142 ⫾ 13 mm hg (p ⬍ .0001) and diastolic
bp from 95 ⫾ 9 to 82 ⫾ 8 mm hg (p ⬍ .0001). the
decrease in bp was significant within 1 month and im-

h

proved further on. the c1 increased by 22%, from 8.0 ⫾
3.1 to 9.7 ⫾ 2.3 ml/mm hg ⫻ 10 (p ⬍ .01). the c2
increased by 35%, from 2.9 ⫾ 1.3 to 3.9 ⫾ 1.9 ml/mm hg
⫻ 100 (p ⬍ .01). both c1 and c2 reached statistical
significance only after 3 months. systemic vascular resistance (svr) decreased by 15% from 2140 ⫾ 376 to 1817
⫾ 262 dynes/sec/cm⫺5 (p ⬍ .0001).
conclusions: treatment with  xxxd3487xxx  in patients
with eh improves small and large ac. the improvement
in ac was significant only after 3 months of treatment,
whereas systolic bp, diastolic bp, and svr decreased
earlier. the  xxxg100xxx  blockade with  xxxd3487xxx  seems to
be an effective means of not only lowering bp but of
reversal of vascular wall damage, which predisposes to
cardiovascular events. am j hypertens 2002;15:

ypertension increases the risk for ascvd and is
associated with increased morbidity and mortality.1,2 the cardiovascular damage seen in hypertensive patients originates mainly from mechanical effects
of blood pressure (bp) as well as unfavorable humoral
setup that induces tissue damage and bp elevation. antihypertensive treatment reduces hypertension-associated
morbidity and mortality,3,4 presumably by regression of
cardiovascular pathologic changes.
arterial compliance has been shown to be impaired in
the presence of risk factors and is associated with cardiovascular events.5 decreased arterial compliance is seen in
patients with congestive heart disease as well as in patients

suffering from diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and other
cardiovascular risk factors. changes in arterial compliance
may serve as surrogate end points for estimation of the
status of the arterial tree and for evaluation of success/
failure of therapeutic interventions. accumulating evidence suggests that abnormalities in arterial compliance
can be used as early, subclinical markers for future development of cardiovascular events and are a useful tool to
estimate the extent of arterial wall damage.6 –10
 xxxg99xxx  is a powerful factor in development of
elevated bp and tissue damage10 and its blockade should
play a major role in remodeling of the vascular wall by
reversing damage in patients with essential hypertension.

at1 blockade and arterial compliance

the purpose of our study was to determine whether
antihypertensive treatment with the  xxxg100xxx  blocker
 xxxd3487xxx  will improve arterial elasticity in addition to its
bp-lowering effect.

methods
patients
the study population included patients with mild-to-moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension. antihypertensive medications and other medications that might affect
the hemodynamic status were discontinued for 3 weeks
and treatment with 80 mg of oral  xxxd3487xxx  was then
started. if bp remained above the desired levels the dose
was increased to 160 mg. we excluded patients with a
history or evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease like
ischemic cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral
vascular disease, and other target organ damage. we also
excluded patients with elevated liver enzymes, atrial fibrillation, fertile women without adequate birth control
measures, uncontrolled endocrine disorders, or intestinal
disorders that could affect absorption of medications or
known hypersensitivity to  xxxd3487xxx .
vascular compliance measurements
the patients were monitored once a month between 8:00
and 11:00 am, before taking their morning medication. on
each follow-up visit arterial compliance was measured in
a quiet, temperature-controlled laboratory after supine rest
for at least 10 min.
radial artery waveforms were obtained using a calibrated tonometer (model cr-2000, hypertension diagnostics inc.) applied to the patient’s radial artery at its
most superficial location at the wrist overlying the radial
bony prominence. the arm was supported by a wrist
stabilizer to ensure optimal positioning and minimize
movement. blood pressure was measured by cuff on the
contralateral arm. the obtained waveforms (mean of 30sec recording) were calibrated to the systolic and diastolic
cuff pressures. a computer-based third order four-element
windkessel model of the circulation was used to match a
diastolic pressure decay of the waveforms and quantify
changes in terms of systemic vascular resistance (svr),
large artery compliance (c1) and small artery compliance
(c2).6 the svr is a calculated variable as mean arterial
pressure (map) divided by cardiac output. the map was
derived from waveform analysis, integrating the area under the curve and calculating the mean area of recordings
during 30 sec. cardiac output was calculated from a multivariate algorithm using cardiac ejection time derived
from the radial artery waveform. the method has been
previously described in depth.6

pertensive medications were discontinued for a period of 3
weeks. during that time patients had an office visit (visit 2)
for bp measurement to exclude severe hypertension
(⬎180/110 mm hg), in which case patients were put back
on antihypertensive treatment and not studied further. at
visit 3 (time 0) patients had baseline bp measurements
taken as well as arterial compliance evaluation and laboratory baseline blood tests (including chemistry, complete
blood count, liver and kidney function tests, urinalysis,
and lipid levels). after baseline evaluation,  xxxd3487xxx  was
started at a dose of 80 mg/day. patients were then invited
for additional office visits at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after
beginning treatment. at each visit bp levels were measured and, if needed, the  xxxd3487xxx  dose was adjusted to
reach a target bp level below 135/85 mm hg. at each
visit, arterial compliance measurements were repeated.
the study was approved by the local ethical review
board (helsinki committee). all patients signed an informed consent upon entry into the study.
each patient served as his/her control. data obtained
were stored and analyzed in a computerized database. data
are presented as means ⫾ standard deviation and as
percent change from baseline. comparisons between
measurements were made using t tests for continuous
variables.

discussion
structural changes within the arterial wall and atherosclerotic plaques reduce the compliance of the arterial wall,
affect the ability of the artery to maintain normal blood
flow and to adjust flexibly to pressure changes. risk factors for cardiovascular disease mediate their effects by
altering the structure, properties, and function of arterial
blood vessels, a process that develops long before the
appearance of symptomatic cardiovascular disease. determination of arterial compliance allows us to diagnose the
extent of damage and the probability of development of
cardiovascular event, as well as to estimate success or
failure of therapeutic intervention.
arterial compliance is reduced in patients with arterial
hypertension,11 and hypertension has been shown to impair arterial compliance.12 this effect of hypertension is
mediated by elevated intravascular pressure and by unfavorable humoral profile, which promotes tissue damage
through the action of growth factors.13
because various antihypertensive agents affect the humoral profile in different ways, it is logical that a therapeutic approach that will neutralize effectively damaging
growth factors will have an advantage over other medica-

tions that will affect bp only. this is the reasoning behind
the arguments that new medications that neutralize growth
factors are preferred over the traditional treatment of hypertension with diuretics or ␤-blockers.
 xxxg99xxx  has immediate effects on vascular
smooth muscle contraction resulting in vasoconstriction,
stimulation of aldosterone secretion, increasing thirst,
sympathetic outflow, and adrenal epinephrine release.13 its
long-term effects are mainly humoral, inducing vascular
and cardiac remodeling, an effect that is responsible, at
least partially, for the decrease in arterial compliance.
in our study the decrease in bp and svr was evident
at the first visit, 1 month after treatment initiation. the
improvement in arterial wall properties developed gradually, achieving statistical significance after 3 months of
treatment. this effect should have been mediated through
blockade of the humoral aspect of  xxxg99xxx  actions,
inducing remodeling of blood vessel wall with reversal of
tissue damage—a more lengthy process.
because arteries become stiffer at high pressures, it is
important to establish that our findings reflect improvement in arterial properties and are not the result of a
decrease in bp per se. arterial remodeling has been shown

rats14 and in dogs.15 similar treatment in humans induced
remodeling of the myocardium.16
it has been argued that because the calculations of c1
and c2 are critically dependent on changes in bp, it may
be difficult to distinguish real changes in compliance from
technical changes in bp. in our study the major decrease
in systolic and diastolic bp was evident at a very early
stage of the study—at the beginning of treatment with
 xxxd3487xxx . a significant decrease in bp was seen after 1
month of treatment. however, the decrease in both large
(c1) and small (c2) artery compliance increased significantly only after 3 months of treatment. the relatively
prolonged period of time for improvement in arterial compliance complies with our concept that the remodeling
process is a lengthy process that needs longer periods to
occur. the dissociation in time of improvement of bp
from the change in arterial properties supports our assumption that real beneficial remodeling of the arterial
wall occurred during  xxxg99xxx  blockade and these
changes do not merely reflect the technical effect of a
decrease in bp. thus, the increase in arterial compliance
seen in our patients is probably the result of improvement
in arterial properties. however, presence of a technical

ajh–december 2002–vol. 15, no. 12

component of bp effect on the calculated value cannot be
totally excluded.
in a recently published study, mahmud et al17 evaluated
the effect of  xxxg99xxx  blockade using  xxxd3487xxx  and
captopril on arterial stiffness, augmentation index, pulse
wave velocity, and bp in a crossover study. using a
different method of estimation of arterial stiffness, this
study shows also improvement in arterial properties upon
blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.
we conclude that treatment with the  xxxg100xxx 
antagonist  xxxd3487xxx  in patients with essential hypertension
increases compliance of both large and small arteries. the
improvement in arterial compliance developed gradually
and was evident within 3 months of treatment, whereas
systolic and diastolic bp and svr decreased significantly
earlier, within the first month of treatment. the  xxxg100xxx  blockade seems to be an effective means of not only
lowering bp but of reversal of vascular wall damage,
which predisposes to cardiovascular end points.
