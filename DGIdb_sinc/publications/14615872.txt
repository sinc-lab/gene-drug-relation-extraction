abstract rationale: impairment of sexual activity is one
of the most frequent side effects of antidepressant drugs.
the increase in the synaptic concentrations of serotonin
seems to be mainly responsible. mirtazapine is a novel
antidepressant that increases the synaptic concentrations
of both noradrenaline and serotonin; moreover, it is an
antagonist at 5-ht2c receptors, whose activation is
considered to be responsible for some typical effects of
serotonin on the ejaculation process (retardation of
ejaculation, anorgasmia). objectives: to study the influence of mirtazapine on copulatory performance and
sexual motivation in male rats, in comparison—or in
combination—with fluoxetine. methods: copulatory performance was studied either in sexually experienced or in
sexually naive rats; sexual motivation was studied in
sexually experienced rats. mirtazapine (1, 5 or 10 mg/kg),
fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), and the combination of mirtazapine + fluoxetine (10+10 mg/kg) were subcutaneously
(s.c.) administered either acutely or daily for 13 days.
results: after acute administration, mirtazapine decreased mount latency (ml) and intromission latency
(il), and increased mount frequency (mf) and ejaculation
latency (el). fluoxetine had no significant effect on any
of the sexual behavior parameters. after a 13-day
treatment, mirtazapine increased ml, il and mf; fluoxetine increased ml, il and the intercopulatory interval
(ici); the addition of mirtazapine to fluoxetine produced a
reduction of ici and an increase of mf. moreover,
mirtazapine significantly improved the performance of
rats in the sexual motivation test. conclusions: the

present results show that, on the whole, the acute
administration of mirtazapine improves several parameters of the copulatory performance of male rats and
strongly stimulates sexual motivation, while the repeated
administration produces minor, conflicting effects. this
effect of mirtazapine on male rat sexual behavior is to be
ascribed to the antagonism at brain a2 adrenergic autoand hetero-receptors, with consequent increased release of
noradrenaline and serotonin, and antagonism at 5-ht2c
receptors, which are involved in the negative influence of
serotonin on male sexual behavior.

introduction
loss of sexual interest is a typical symptom in depression
(american psychiatric association 1995). unfortunately
enough, the most frequent side effects of antidepressant
drugs, too, include impairment of sexual activity (gitlin
1995). tricyclic antidepressants in particular cause erectile dysfunction (harrison et al. 1986; balon et al. 1993;
crenshaw and goldberg 1996), whereas selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) typically cause loss of
sexual desire and delayed orgasm or anorgasmia. in
particular, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine have been reported to induce orgasm dysfunction
(retarded ejaculation, delayed orgasm up to anorgasmia)
in up to 75% of patients and reduced sexual desire in 20–
40% (herman et al. 1990; solyom et al. 1990; zajecka et
al. 1991; jacobsen 1992; meston and gorzalka 1992;
murdoch and mactavish 1992; patterson 1993; dorevitch
and davis 1994; waldinger et al. 1994, 1997; zohar et al.
1994; aizenberg et al. 1995; baldwin 1995; hsu and shen
1995; lane et al. 1995; mendels et al. 1995; segraves
1995; ludovico et al. 1996; modell et al. 1997).
many experimental data have shown that brain serotonin inhibits sexual behavior in males, whereas brain
dopamine and noradrenaline play a stimulating role

(tagliamonte et al. 1969; gessa and tagliamonte 1974;
clark et al. 1984; bitran and hull 1987; smith et al. 1987;
hillegaart et al. 1989; benelli et al. 1990, 1993). in
particular, retarded ejaculation and orgasm dysfunction
seem to be due to  xxxg1115xxx  activation (waldinger
et al. 1998; hirschfeld 1999). thus, the adverse influence
of antidepressants of the ssri type on sexual activity is
generally assumed to be causally related to inhibition of
serotonin reuptake and to a subsequent increase in the
synaptic concentrations of serotonin. in the case of
tricyclic antidepressants, their antimuscarinic effect may
also be involved (hirschfeld 1999).
mirtazapine belongs to a novel category of antidepressants that modify the activity of both the noradrenergic and the serotonergic systems (noradrenergic and
specific serotonergic antidepressants, nassas; for a
review: kent 2000). mirtazapine is a potent antagonist
of central a2 adrenergic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors: this results in an increase in the release of both
noradrenaline (due to blockade of a2 autoreceptors) and
serotonin (due to blockade of the inhibitory a2 heteroreceptors located on serotonergic terminals; de boer et al.
1994). moreover, mirtazapine is an antagonist of serotonin 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c and 5-ht3 receptors (de boer et al.
1988; smith and davidson 1990). the results of these

actions are to increase both noradrenergic and specific 5ht1 serotonergic transmission (de boer et al. 1996). on
the whole, and particularly due to its antagonistic effect
on 5-ht2c receptors and on a2 autoreceptors, it could be
hypothesized that mirtazapine should have no detrimental
effect on sexual behavior, contrary to most antidepressants. in fact, some clinical studies report that, in
depressed patients under treatment with ssri antidepressants and suffering from sexual impotence, mirtazapine
was able to restore sexual function (boyarsky et al. 1999;
farah et al. 1999).
in the light of the above considerations and data, the
present research was undertaken with the aim of establishing the influence of mirtazapine on the copulatory
activity and sexual motivation of male rats, in comparison
with fluoxetine.

methods and materials
animals
adult sprague-dawley rats, weighing 240–270 g on arrival from
charles river, calco (como, italy), were used. they were housed
in groups of 4–5, males and females separately (in different rooms),
in plexiglas cages (402515 cm), in climatized colony rooms

rats (mann-whitney u-test)

(21€1c; 60% humidity), with food in pellets and tap water
continuously available. since rats are nocturnal and usually display
most sexual behavior during the night, they were kept under a 12-h/
12-h reversed light/dark cycle, with lights on from 1900 hours to
0700 hours. housing conditions and experimentation procedures
were strictly in accordance with the “principles of laboratory
animal care” (nih publication no. 86–23, revised 1985) and
european community ethical regulations on the care and use of
animals for scientific research (cee council 86/609; italian d.l.
27/01/92 no. 116).
the rats were accustomed to our housing conditions for at least
1 week before being used. the females were ovariectomized under
 xxxd2052xxx  anesthesia and brought into estrous by the subcutaneus
(s.c.) injection of 15 mg  xxxd2038xxx  followed, 48 h later, by
the s.c. injection of 500 mg progesterone. they were screened with
non-experimental sexually experienced males, and only those
exhibiting good sexual proceptivity and receptivity, that is,
solicitation behavior, and lordosis in response to mounting, and
no rejection behavior, were used.
test of copulatory behavior
the copulatory behavior of males was tested during the period of
darkness (between 1000 hours and 1400 hours) in a sound-proof
room, under a dim red light, according to the standard procedure
(dewsbury et al. 1972; clark et al. 1987). after a 10-min adaptation
period in a rectangular glass observation cage (605040 cm), a
stimulus female was presented to the male by dropping it gently

into the cage. the following behavioral parameters were recorded
or calculated: mount latency (ml) and intromission latency (il),
the time from introduction of the female to the occurrence of the
first mount or intromission; ejaculation latency (el), the time from
the first intromission to ejaculation; post-ejaculation interval (pei),
the time from ejaculation to the first intromission of the subsequent
copulatory sequence; mount and intromission frequencies (mf and
if, respectively), the number of mounts and intromissions preceding ejaculation; intercopulatory interval (ici), the average interval
between successive intromissions (calculated as el divided by if);
copulatory efficacy (ce), a measure of intromissive success
(calculated as if divided by mf+if). ml, il, el, pei and ici
were considered to be inversely proportional to arousal/motivation,
while if and ce were considered to be indicative of performance/
potency (beach 1956). tests were terminated immediately after the
first pei, if intromission did not occur within 15 min of female
introduction, if el exceeded 30 min, or if pei exceeded 15 min.
rats were either pre-trained with sexually receptive females (7
times, at 5-day intervals, before the experimental test) or sexually
naive when subjected to the experimental test. among pre-trained
rats, only those subjects that successfully completed the last three
training tests keeping within the above-mentioned time limits were
considered sexually potent and selected for the experimental test.
in a set of experiments, pre-trained, sexually potent rats were
allowed to copulate for 30 min before the test was terminated, and
the number of ejaculations (ejaculation frequency) was measured
(timed test).

test of sexual motivation
a rectangular glass box (1302030 cm) was divided into three
portions: the start portion, 50 cm length; an electrical grid, 30 cm
length; and the goal box, 50 cm length. an estrous female was
tethered in the goal portion. the test male was placed in the start
portion and allowed to cross the grid (not electrified) to reach the
receptive female five consecutive times. each time, immediately
after the first mount (either with or without penetration) the male
was repositioned in the start portion of the box. after the fifth
crossing, the grid was electrified (0.05 ma), and the following
parameters were evaluated: latency to the 7th crossing trough the
grid (=2nd crossing with electrified grid), number of crossings with
electrified grid, number of approaches to the grid not followed by
crossing, number of episodes of grooming, number of spontaneous
erections (far from the female: looking at the estrous female
without crossing the grid), latency to ejaculation. the overall
duration of the test was 15 min. rats used in this test were sexually
experienced and were used only for this experiment.
drugs and treatments
mirtazapine and fluoxetine were obtained from n.v. organon (oss,
the netherlands). they were dissolved in saline immediately
before use, and subcutaneously (s.c.) injected in the volume of
1 ml/kg b.w., 30 min before behavioral testing. mirtazapine was
administered at the doses of 1, 5 or 10 mg/kg, whereas only one
dose of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was used (chosen on the bases of

previous literature data; wieseler frank et al. 2000). both drugs
were administered either acutely or once a day for 13 consecutive
days; in the former case, drugs were administered 30 min before
behavioral testing; in the latter case, behavioral testing was
performed 3 h after the last dose. rats treated for 13 days were
tested also during the treatment period, 6 days before the
experimental session. in a set of experiments, mirtazapine and
fluoxetine were administered in combination.
the timed test (rats allowed to copulate for 30 min) was
performed only with rats treated with the highest dose of
mirtazapine (10 mg/kg) for 13 days. in this case, only the number
of ejaculations (ejaculation frequency) was measured, 30 min after
the first dose, and 3 h after the 7th and after the 13th doses.
each animal was used for only one level of dosage, and at least
ten rats per group or dosage of drugs were used.
statistical analysis of data
data are expressed as mean €sem. statistical analysis of data
reported in fig. 1 and fig. 3 was performed by kruskall-wallis
anova followed by mann-whitney u-test with bonferroni
correction, every treatment being compared with saline group.
mann-whitney u-test was used for comparison among two groups.
data obtained in the timed test were analyzed using anova for
repeated measures. data on percentage variation in body weight
were analyzed by anova followed by bonferroni correction.

results
copulatory performance of sexually trained
and experienced rats
as shown in fig. 1, the s.c. administration of a single dose
of mirtazapine (1, 5, or 10 mg/kg, 30 min before the
copulatory test) produced a shortening of both ml and il
(significant for the doses of 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg), and
an increase of el (significant for the doses of 1 mg/kg
and 5 mg/kg), and an increase of mf (significant for the
doses of 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg). no significant effect was
observed on pei, ici, if, and ce. fluoxetine (10 mg/kg
s.c., 30 min before the test) had no significant influence
on any of the recorded parameters.
the combination of mirtazapine and fluoxetine
(10+10 mg/kg) produced an increase of il and mf,
whereas the others parameters were not significantly
influenced (fig. 2).
following 13 daily treatments, mirtazapine produced
an increase of ml (significant for the doses of 5 mg/kg
and 10 mg/kg), il ( significant for all the three doses),
and mf (significant for the doses of 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/
kg). no significant effect was observed on el, pei, if,
ici and ce. fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day) produced a
significant increase of ml, il and ici (fig. 3). in the
timed test (rats allowed to copulate for 30 min), no
significant difference in ejaculation frequency was observed between mirtazapine-treated and saline-treated rats
(fig. 4).
the combination of mirtazapine and fluoxetine
(10+10 mg/kg/day) produced a reduction of ici and an
increase of mf; the other parameters were not significantly modified (fig. 5).
copulatory performance of sexually naive rats
in comparison with saline-treated controls, rats treated
with a single dose of mirtazapine (10 mg/kg) had a
reduction of il and ici, and an increase of if (fig. 6).
the same dose, administered daily for 13 consecutive
days, produced an increase of il and if, and a reduction
of ici (fig. 7).

and 13th day of treatment. values are mean €sem. twelve rats per
group

sexual motivation
as shown in table 1, rats treated with mirtazapine
(10 mg/kg) crossed the electrified grid to reach the estrous
female more times than controls.
moreover, 7 of 11 rats treated with mirtazapine
succeeded in achieving ejaculation, while not one in the
control group achieved ejaculation within the time limits
of the test. rats treated with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), or
with mirtazapine in combination with fluoxetine
(10+10 mg/kg), did not behave differently from salinetreated controls.
body weight
in our experimental conditions, fluoxetine decreased body
weight at the 13th day of treatment; however, mirtazapine, at the same daily dose (10 mg/kg), had no effect.
the combination of fluoxetine with mirtazapine decreased body weight starting from as early as the 9th
day, and the effect was much more pronounced than with
fluoxetine alone (fig. 8).

discussion
the present results show that in sexually experienced
male rats the acute administration of mirtazapine improved some parameters of copulatory behavior (reduction of ml and il; increase of mf), while having no
effect on other parameters (if, ici, ce, pei), and actually
increasing el. the overall duration of the copulatory
episode was increased, but there was no reduction of
copulatory efficiency; yet, several indicators of arousal/
motivation were unchanged (pei, ici) or actually ameliorated (ml, il).
a 13-day treatment caused an increase of ml and il,
no modification of el, pei, if, ici and ce, and an
increase of mf. in this case, the overall duration of the
copulatory episode was not modified, two indicators of
arousal/motivation (ml and il) were increased, while the
other indicators of arousal/motivation (el, pei, ici) and
the indicators of performance/potency (if and ce) were
unchanged. also the ejaculation frequency in the timed
test were not modified by mirtazapine. however, again in
sexually experienced male rats, the acute administration
of fluoxetine had no effect; whereas a 13-day treatment of

fluoxetine caused a worsening of several indicators of
arousal/motivation (ml, il, ici). previous data (cantor
et al. 1999) have shown that also the ejaculation
frequency in a timed test was reduced in rats treated for
at least 1 month with fluoxetine at the daily dose of
10 mg/kg. due to the different treatment duration, the
data obtained by cantor et al. cannot, however, be
compared with ours. the combination of fluoxetine with
mirtazapine ameliorates the picture: only ici was reduced, and mf was actually increased.
in sexually naive rats, the acute administration of
mirtazapine improved il, ici and if; and also in the
sexual motivation test, these rats behaved  xxxd102xxx 
than controls. a 13-day treatment caused a worsening of
il and an improvement of if and ici.
our results show that, on the whole, mirtazapine
improved rather than worsened the copulatory performance of male rats, and in particular stimulated sexual
motivation. at the same time, these results confirm
previous data (taylor et al. 1996; cantor et al. 1999;
wieseler frank et al. 2000) indicating that the repeated
administration of fluoxetine worsened almost all the
parameters of male copulatory activity, and showed that

the addition of mirtazapine limits the negative effect of
fluoxetine. however, the acute administration of fluoxetine has been reported to worsen some parameters of the
copulatory activity of male rats (increase of el and pei,
decrease of the ce; yells et al. 1994, 1995; cantor et al.
1999) or to have no significant effect (mos et al. 1999).
our present data are an experimental confirmation and
support of several clinical observations indicating that
mirtazapine has a beneficial effect on sexual functioning
in both depressed women and men (return of normal
sexual functioning or significant improvement in sexual
functioning; improvement of desire, arousal/erection and
ease/satisfaction of orgasm) (boyarsky et al. 1999; farah
et al. 1999; gelenberg et al. 2000). thus, as far as sexual
function is concerned, it would seem that mirtazapine
behaves quite differently from most antidepressants. the
reasons for this are in all probability to be found in its
peculiar mechanism of action. mirtazapine potently
antagonizes brain a2 adrenergic auto- and hetero-receptors. this causes an increased release of noradrenaline
and serotonin; but the negative effect of serotonin on
sexual behavior is prevented by the mirtazapine antago-

nistic activity at 5-ht2 receptors (de boer et al. 1988,
1994; smith and davidson 1990)
the positive influence of a2 adrenergic antagonists on
male sexual behavior has been repeatedly described.
systemic administration of yohimbine, as well as of other
a2 adrenergic antagonists more specific than yohimbine
(idazoxan, imiloxan, efaroxan), stimulates male rat sexual
behavior (clark et al. 1984, 1985; smith et al. 1987;
benelli et al 1993). however, clonidine, primarily an a2
adrenoceptor agonist, and  xxxd2241xxx , a selective a2
adrenoceptor agonist, depress male copulatory behavior
(clark et al. 1985; benelli et al. 1993).
in conclusion, our present experimental data indicate
that the antidepressant drug mirtazapine stimulates male
sexual motivation and, on the whole, improves male
copulatory performance in rats.
