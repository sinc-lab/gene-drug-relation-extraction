in vivo  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic stimulation of human
thermogenesis and lipid use
objective: to investigate the role of the human  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor in in vivo  xxxd2401xxx  (inn,  xxxd2398xxx )-induced thermogenesis and lipid use.
methods: eight male volunteers participated in two studies. in the first study subjects received oral dosages
of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 40 mg  xxxd2689xxx  or propranolol (both  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonists)
at random, after which  xxxd2401xxx  ( xxxg836xxx -, beta2-, and  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor agonist) was infused in an individually determined dosage (range, 19 to 35 ng/kg · min) that increased energy expenditure by 25% without pretreatment. in the second study, 50, 100, and 200 ng/kg · min  xxxd2401xxx  or saline solution
were infused after pretreatment with 80 mg  xxxd2689xxx . in both studies energy expenditure and respiratory
exchange ratio were measured by indirect calorimetry and, at the end of each infusion period, blood samples were taken and tremor score (only first study), heart rate, and blood pressure were measured.
results: in the first study,  xxxd2689xxx  or propranolol in doses ≤40 mg could not fully block  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic
receptor–mediated increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure. propranolol in doses ≤7.5 mg could
not fully block the beta2-adrenergic receptor–mediated increase in tremor score during  xxxd2401xxx  infusion. the increases found in thermogenesis and lipid use could therefore be explained by concomitant
 xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenergic stimulation. in the second study,  xxxd2401xxx  infusion induced a significant increase
in heart rate, but no increases in thermogenesis and lipid use were found compared with infusion of saline
solution.
conclusion: no evidence could be found for a  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor–mediated increase in human thermogenesis and lipid use during  xxxd2401xxx  infusion after pretreatment with  xxxd2689xxx  or propranolol. (clin

the sympathetic nervous system plays an important
role in energy and substrate metabolism. the effects of
the sympathetic nervous system are mediated by alpha- and
beta-adrenergic receptors. alpha-adrenergic stimulation does
not affect whole-body thermogenesis,1,2 whereas nonselective beta-adrenergic stimulation significantly increases
thermogenesis and lipid use.2,3 during only  xxxg836xxx - or only

beta2-adrenergic stimulation, energy expenditure, lipid
oxidation, and lipolysis also increase.2,4 the role of the
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor in human energy and substrate
metabolism is still debated. in rats,  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic stimulation leads to significant increases in thermogenesis
and lipid use, which results in weight loss.5,6 if this is
also the case in humans, specific  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor agonists may be seen as potential antiobesity drugs,
especially because  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic stimulation causes no
tachycardia or tremor. however, the rat  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic
receptor differs pharmacologically from the human
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor.7,8 consequently the specific
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor agonists used in rats are only
weak agonists in humans. at this time no full
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor agonist is available for administration in humans.
in vitro studies with isolated human fat cells have
indicated that the  xxxg836xxx -, beta2-, and  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor
agonist  xxxd2401xxx  (inn,  xxxd2398xxx ) induces
 xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenergic receptor–mediated lipolysis in

the nanomolar dose range, whereas  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor–mediated lipolysis is activated at ~100-fold higher
concentrations.9,10 in vivo studies with  xxxd2401xxx 
show contradictory results.  xxxd2401xxx  infusion leading to nanomolar plasma concentrations predominantly
stimulated adipose tissue lipolysis by  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic
receptor stimulation because simultaneous  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic
receptor blockade with atenolol completely inhibited
the increase in plasma free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations.11 in another study  xxxd2401xxx -induced
lipolysis was completely blocked by the  xxxg836xxx - and beta2adrenergic receptor antagonist  xxxd2689xxx .3 however,
energy expenditure significantly increased despite
 xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenergic receptor blockade, suggesting
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor–mediated thermogenesis.3 the
indirectly acting sympathomimetic agent ephedrine significantly increased energy expenditure after pretreatment with a low dose of  xxxd2689xxx , but thermogenesis was
completely inhibited after a higher dosage of  xxxd2689xxx .12
norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis completely disappeared after intravenous infusion of the  xxxg836xxx - and
beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol.2 these
studies provide no evidence for a  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor–mediated effect on thermogenesis in humans.
the discrepancies between these studies may be
attributable to differences in the type and dose of the
beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists used. to
investigate whether the human  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor
plays a role in  xxxd2401xxx -induced human thermogenesis, two studies were performed. in the first study different dosages of the  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenergic receptor
antagonists  xxxd2689xxx  and propranolol were administered
to see which minimal dosage is required to block all
 xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenergic receptor–mediated effects of a
standardized dose of  xxxd2401xxx . furthermore, we
investigated whether a significant increase in thermogenesis, lipid use, or both would remain after full
 xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenergic receptor blockade, which would
provide evidence for a functional role of the human
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor. in the second study,  xxxd2401xxx  was given at a twofold to tenfold higher infusion rate in combination with  xxxd2689xxx  to see whether
 xxxd2401xxx  could induce any  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor–mediated effects on thermogenesis and lipid use in
vivo at these higher concentrations.
subjects and methods
subjects. eight healthy men with a mean age of 21.4
years (age range, 19 to 26 years) and a mean body mass
index (bmi) of 22.4 kg/m2 (bmi range, 20.0 to 25.5
kg/m2) participated in the first study. seven comparable subjects with a mean age of 23.0 years (age range,

20 to 27 years) and a mean body mass index of 22.1
kg/m2 (bmi range, 20.2 to 25.5 kg/m2) participated in
the second study. all subjects were in good health and
were taking no medication at the time of the study. the
study protocol was approved by the ethics committee
of maastricht university, and all subjects gave written
informed consent before entering the study.
experimental protocol. in both studies subjects
came to the laboratory after fasting overnight for at least
10 hours. they came by car or public transportation to
minimize the amount of physical activity before the
tests. on arrival a canula was inserted into a forearm
vein of each subject, and the subjects rested in a semisupine position during the remainder of the test. all
subjects watched television or videos during the tests.
the room temperature was kept between 23°c to 25°c,
and there were at least 3 days between tests.
during the first visit in the first study, an incremental  xxxd2401xxx  dose response test was performed. a
30-minute baseline period was followed by increasing
doses of 10, 20, and 40 ng/kg · min  xxxd2401xxx  ( xxxd2401xxx  sulfate, fresenius, ’s hertogenbosch, the
netherlands), per dose for 30 minutes. during the test
energy expenditure was continuously measured, and
heart rate was monitored. when heart rate rose more
than 35 beats/min above baseline,  xxxd2401xxx  infusion was stopped. with linear regression analysis the
dose of  xxxd2401xxx  required for a 25% increase in
energy expenditure was calculated for each subject.
during the eight remaining visits in the first study,
subjects took 2.5, 7.5, 15, or 40 mg oral  xxxd2689xxx  ( xxxd2689xxx , bristol-myers squibb, woerden, the netherlands)
or 2.5, 7.5, 15, or 40 mg oral propranolol (inderal,
zeneca, ridderkerk, the netherlands) 2 hours before
they came to the laboratory. on arrival, a 30-minute baseline period was followed by a 30-minute infusion period
in which subjects received their individually determined
dose of  xxxd2401xxx . the study design was singleblinded for subjects, and the antagonists were given at
random. during the test, energy expenditure and the respiratory exchange ratio were continuously measured, and
heart rate was monitored. after 20 minutes of each 30minute period, blood pressure and tremor of the dominant hand were measured, and a blood sample was
obtained at the end of each 30-minute period.
during the second study subjects ingested 80 mg
 xxxd2689xxx  2 hours before arrival at the laboratory. after a
baseline period of 30 minutes, a continuous infusion of
 xxxd2401xxx  or saline solution was started.  xxxd2401xxx  was infused in increasing dosages of 50, 100,
and 200 ng/kg · min for 30 minutes each. saline solution was administered at the same infusion rates. the

methods. whole-body energy expenditure and the
respiratory exchange ratio were measured by indirect
calorimetry with an open-circuit ventilated hood system.13 the volume of air drawn through the hood was
measured by a dry-gas meter (schlumberger, dordrecht,
the netherlands), and the composition of the inflowing
and outflowing air was analyzed by a paramagnetic oxygen analyzer (servomex, crowborough, england) and
an infrared carbon dioxide analyzer (hartmann and
braun, hanover, germany). airflow rate and the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations of the ingoing
and outgoing air were used to compute oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production on-line every
2 minutes through an automatic acquisition system
interfaced with a personal computer. energy expenditure was calculated according to the formula of weir.14
energy expenditure and respiratory exchange ratio values were averaged over the last 20 minutes and 10 minutes of each infusion step, respectively, and their mean
values were used for further analysis.
heart rate was also monitored continuously by conventional electrocardiography, and the mean heart rate
was calculated during the last 20 minutes of each infusion step. blood pressure was measured after 20 minutes in each infusion interval by an automatic blood
pressure device (speidel & keller, jungingen, germany), and the mean value of five measurements was
used for further analysis.
tremor of the dominant hand was determined with
a steadiness test (steadiness tester 32011, lafayette
instrument company, lafayette, ind) at the end of each

infusion period in study 1. the task of the subjects in
this test was to hold a metal-tipped stylus for 15 seconds in six progressively smaller hole sizes without
touching the sides. if tremor occurred, subjects would
touch the sides more often, and the tremor score consequently increased.
analytical methods. blood samples for the determination of plasma glycerol and free fatty acid concentrations
were preserved in sodium–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid. heparinized blood was collected for the determination of plasma lactate and potassium concentrations.
blood samples were immediately centrifuged for 1
minute at 7000g. plasma was transferred into microtest
tubes, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
–70°c until further analysis. plasma free  xxxd2154xxx  concentrations were measured with the nefa c kit
(99475409, wako, neuss, germany) (coefficient of
variation [cv], 2.6%) with a cobas-fara centrifugal analyzer (roche diagnostica, bern, switzerland). plasma
glycerol concentrations were measured with a glycerol kit
(644200 without triglyceride breakdown step, boehringer,
mannheim, germany; cv, 0.9%), and plasma lactate concentrations were measured by the method of gutmann and
wahlefeld15 (cv, 2.0%) with a cobas-bio centrifugal analyzer (roche diagnostica). plasma potassium concentration was determined by an ion-selective electrode (salm
& kipp, breukelen, the netherlands; cv, 0.7%). in each
run, standard samples with known concentrations were
included for quality control.

results
first study. the dose of  xxxd2401xxx  required for a
25% increase in energy expenditure ranged from 19 to
35 ng/kg · min, with a mean value of 27 ng/kg · min.
the dosages of  xxxd2689xxx  used in this study had no
effect on baseline values of the measured parameters
(table i). after 2.5 mg  xxxd2689xxx , subsequent  xxxd2401xxx 
infusion significantly increased energy expenditure (fig
1) and plasma free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations
(fig 2), as well as heart rate and systolic blood pressure
(fig 3); it significantly lowered the respiratory exchange
ratio (fig 1) and diastolic blood pressure (fig 3). plasma
lactate and potassium concentrations and tremor score
were not significantly affected (table ii). after pretreatment with 7.5, 15, and 40 mg  xxxd2689xxx ,  xxxd2401xxx  infusion resulted in significant increases in heart
rate and systolic blood pressure only and a significant
decrease in diastolic blood pressure (7.5 mg only) and
the respiratory exchange ratio (40 mg only). all other
parameters remained unchanged.
the dosages of propranolol used did not affect baseline parameters (table i). pretreatment with 2.5, 7.5,
and 15 mg propranolol led to significant increases
in plasma free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations
(fig 2) and heart rate and systolic blood pressure (fig 3),
and it led to significant decreases in the respiratory
exchange ratio (fig 1) and diastolic blood pressure
(fig 3). energy expenditure (fig 1) and tremor score
(table ii) significantly increased during  xxxd2401xxx 
infusion after pretreatment with 2.5 and 7.5 mg propranolol only but not after 15 and 40 mg propranolol.
plasma lactate and potassium concentrations were not
affected by propranolol (table i). after administration
of 40 mg propranolol,  xxxd2401xxx  infusion still led
to significant increases in heart rate and systolic blood
pressure and a significant decrease in tremor score.
in summary, both  xxxd2689xxx  and propranolol antagonized the changes induced by  xxxd2401xxx . at the
highest dosages of  xxxd2689xxx  and propranolol, still significant changes in heart rate and systolic blood pressure
were found during  xxxd2401xxx  infusion; most other
parameters no longer differed significantly from baseline. at the same dose of antagonist, the antagonizing
effect of  xxxd2689xxx  on changes in the respiratory exchange
ratio, plasma free fatty acid concentration, tremor score,
systolic blood pressure (factorial anova for antagonist, all p < .01), and heart rate (factorial anova for
antagonist, p < .001) was more pronounced than the
antagonizing effect of propranolol.

lactate, and potassium concentrations; heart rate; and
systolic blood pressure after pretreatment with 80 mg
 xxxd2689xxx . the respiratory exchange ratio significantly
decreased and diastolic blood pressure remained
unchanged during saline solution or  xxxd2401xxx  infusion (fig 4 and table iii).
only the increase in heart rate was significantly higher
during  xxxd2401xxx  infusion compared with saline solution infusion (two-way repeated-measurements anova
for heart rate × treatment, p < .001; fig 4). the other
parameters did not differ between treatments.
discussion
the first study was performed to investigate whether
any significant increases in  xxxd2401xxx -induced thermogenesis, lipid use, or both would remain after full
 xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenergic receptor blockade that would
provide evidence for a functional role of the human
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor during  xxxd2401xxx  infusion. to
ensure that all  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptor–mediated effects
of  xxxd2401xxx  were blocked by  xxxd2689xxx  or propranolol,
heart rate and systolic blood pressure were measured as
indicators for  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic stimulation.16 administration of  xxxd2689xxx  or propranolol in a range of 2.5 to 40 mg
could not prevent a significant  xxxd2401xxx -induced
increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure. this
result suggests that no complete  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptor
blockade was achieved with the dosages of antagonists
used. to control for beta2-adrenergic stimulation, plasma
lactate and potassium concentrations and tremor score
were measured as specific indicators for beta2-adrenergic
stimulation.16 an  xxxd2401xxx -induced increase in
tremor score occurred after pretreatment with 2.5 and
7.5 mg propranolol only. otherwise, no indications for
beta2-adrenergic stimulation could be found, indicating that
after pretreatment with 2.5 to 40 mg  xxxd2689xxx  and 15 and
40 mg propranolol, all beta2-adrenergic receptor–mediated
effects of  xxxd2401xxx  were blocked. overall, however,
no complete  xxxg836xxx - or beta2-adrenergic receptor blockade was
achieved after pretreatment with  xxxd2689xxx  or with propranolol at dosages ≤40 mg. this result suggests that the
increases in energy expenditure, lipid oxidation, as indicated by a decrease in respiratory exchange ratio, and
lipolysis, as indicated by increases in plasma free fatty
acids and glycerol concentrations, observed in the first
study might be explained by  xxxg836xxx - and/or beta2-adrenergic
stimulation, and no evidence can be provided for a functional role of the human  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor in thermogenesis and lipid use during the infusion of ~30
ng/kg · min  xxxd2401xxx .
in the second study,  xxxd2401xxx  infusion rates were
increased to 50, 100, and 200 ng/kg · min. the  xxxd2689xxx

dose was increased to 80 mg because the 40 mg  xxxd2689xxx 
used in the first study did not completely block all
 xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptor–mediated effects on heart rate and
systolic blood pressure.  xxxd2689xxx  was chosen because its
blocking properties were more pronounced compared
with those of propranolol, as shown in the first study,
and higher dosages of propranolol might partly block
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors, as shown by emorine et al.17
in the second study,  xxxd2401xxx  infusion did not
cause any significant changes in energy expenditure,
lipid oxidation, and lipolysis compared with saline
solution infusion. only a significant increase in heart
rate occurred compared with saline solution, which
might indicate that nonselective beta-adrenergic stimulation by a high dosage of  xxxd2401xxx  overcomes
 xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptor blockade. we therefore concluded that after pretreatment with 80 mg  xxxd2689xxx ,  xxxd2401xxx  infusion at a rate ≤200 ng/kg · min does
not provide evidence for a  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor–
mediated increase in thermogenesis and lipid use in
vivo in humans. in vitro studies in chinese hamster
ovary cells show that 3.9 nmol/l  xxxd2401xxx  is
required to produce a half-maximal response for the
human  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor.17 plasma levels of
~10 nmol/l are achieved with an infusion rate of 200
ng/kg · min, suggesting that the  xxxd2401xxx  concentration might have been high enough to find an effect
of  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor stimulation.

wheeldon et al3 performed a similar study. they
infused  xxxd2401xxx  at a rate (0.5 to 3.0 µg/min) that
increased the individual heart rate by 60 beats/min and
resulted in a 30% increase in energy expenditure. pretreatment with 20 and 80 mg  xxxd2689xxx  completely
blocked  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptor–specific changes in
heart rate and beta2-adrenergic receptor–specific changes
in finger tremor. concomitant  xxxd2401xxx  infusion
induced a significant 13% and 10% increase in thermogenesis after pretreatment with 20 and 80 mg  xxxd2689xxx ,
respectively, which was considered to be the result of
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic stimulation. the  xxxd2401xxx -induced
increases in lipid oxidation and lipolysis were completely blocked by 20 and 80 mg  xxxd2689xxx , suggesting
that fat metabolism was probably not stimulated
by  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors. according to our study,
 xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptors are not fully blocked at the
 xxxd2689xxx  concentrations used, and the observed increase
in thermogenesis might therefore be explained by concomitant  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic stimulation.
liu et al12 performed a study in which ephedrine was
given to stimulate the release of norepinephrine from
sympathetic nerve endings, leading to high local norepinephrine concentrations. thirty milligrams of ephedrine
produced a 6.6% increase in energy expenditure. after
pretreatment with 2.5 mg  xxxd2689xxx , energy expenditure
still significantly increased by 2.3% after ephedrine
administration. after pretreatment with 5 and 10 mg

 xxxd2689xxx , no changes in energy expenditure were found.
all ephedrine-induced changes in heart rate and blood
pressure were blocked after pretreatment with 2.5 mg
 xxxd2689xxx  according to liu et al,12 but they neglected to
correct for baseline values, which were also affected by
 xxxd2689xxx . according to our recalculations, ephedrine
induced an increase in systolic blood pressure after pretreatment with 2.5 mg  xxxd2689xxx  and an increase in both
systolic blood pressure and heart rate with 5 mg  xxxd2689xxx .
this result suggests that  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptors were
not completely blocked with these lower dosages of
 xxxd2689xxx , which is in accordance with our findings and
those of wheeldon et al.3 the observed significant
increase in thermogenesis by liu et al12 might therefore
be attributable to concomitant  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic stimulation
and not to  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic stimulation.
finally, blaak et al2 showed that infusion of the alpha-,
 xxxg836xxx -, beta2-, and  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor agonists epinephrine (15 to 60 ng/kg · min) or norepinephrine (25 to 100
ng/kg · min) in combination with propranolol infusion
(bolus, 195 µg/kg; infusion, 0.6 µg/kg · min) did not
change energy expenditure but significantly increased
mean arterial blood pressure by alpha-adrenergic receptor
stimulation and consequently significantly decreased
heart rate. blaak et al2 concluded that the dosages of
epinephrine and norepinephrine used could not induce
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor–mediated thermogenesis.
the previously described studies are the only ones published until now that have selectively tried to stimulate
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors. other studies used relatively unselective  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor agonists to determine the
effect of  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic stimulation on human thermogenesis and lipid use in vivo. the thermogenic compound
ro 16-8714 not only increased energy expenditure but
also had significant effects on heart rate and systolic
blood pressure, indicating that part of its effect was mediated by  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptors.18 clinical studies with
brl 26830a showed that this  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor
agonist induced not only thermogenesis but also tremor,
suggesting additional beta2-adrenergic stimulation.19 the
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor agonist brl 35135 significantly
increased thermogenesis and lipid use and also induced
a significant decrease in serum potassium concentration,
indicating additional beta2-adrenergic stimulation. after
pretreatment with 20 mg  xxxd2689xxx , brl 35135 still caused
a small but significant increase in thermogenesis, but
lipid oxidation and lipolysis were unaffected.20 because
heart rate and blood pressure were not measured in this
study, it is unknown whether concomitant  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic
stimulation could explain this effect.
although no clear evidence is available from in vivo
studies, we believe that  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors may

still play a role in human thermogenesis and lipid use.
after the administration of cgp 12177 (selective
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor agonist with  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonist properties), significant increases
in glycerol release were found both in vitro21,22 from
omental and abdominal fat cells and in situ23,24 from
abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue with the use of
the microdialysis technique. the increase in glycerol
concentration was only 30% of that found after  xxxd2401xxx  administration21,22,24 but was not affected by the
addition of propranolol,22,23 indicating that cgp 12177
is a weak but selective  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor agonist.
no studies are available on in vivo effects of cgp
12177. furthermore, several studies have shown that an
increase in plasma free fatty acid levels caused by infusion of a lipid or lipid heparin mixture induces increases
in lipid oxidation25 and thermogenesis.26,27 thus if cgp
12177 or a full  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor agonist is capable of increasing lipolysis to the extent that plasma free
fatty acid levels increase, significant effects in lipid oxidation and thermogenesis may be expected.
in conclusion, the data from this study indicate that
the dosages of  xxxd2689xxx  and propranolol used did not
fully block all  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenergic receptor–mediated
effects at the given concentrations of  xxxd2401xxx .
furthermore, no evidence could be provided for a
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor–mediated increase in human
energy expenditure, lipid oxidation, and lipolysis during  xxxd2401xxx  infusion at dosages ≤200 ng/kg · min.
however, with the development of more selective
 xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor agonists in the future, a possible role for the  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptor in in vivo human
thermogenesis and lipid use might still be shown.
