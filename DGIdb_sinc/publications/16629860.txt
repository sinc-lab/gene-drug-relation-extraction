abstract the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist  xxxd3302xxx  is an
effective prokinetic agent that increases gastrointestinal secretion and reduces visceral sensitivity.  xxxd3302xxx  has both  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist and 5-ht2b
receptor antagonist activity, the latter being a less
potent effect of the drug. in a rat model of colonic
hypersensitivity, selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonists
only partially reversed the antihyperalgesic effect of
 xxxd3302xxx  suggesting that non- xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated mechanisms may also be involved in its overall
antihyperalgesic action. the objective of this study
was to determine whether 5-ht2b receptors play a role
in colonic hypersensitivity. a visceromotor response
(vmr) in acutely sensitized animals (intracolonic
acetic acid, 0.6%, 1.5 ml) quantified colonic hypersensitivity. acetic acid produced an increase in the
vmr at all distension pressures. however, neither the
 xxxg1114xxx  agonist bw 723c86, the 5-ht2b antagonist sb204741 or the 5-ht2b/2c antagonist sb
206553 caused any significant inhibition of the vmr.
in summary, in the same rodent model in which
 xxxd3302xxx  has previously been shown to produce a
potent antihyperalgesic effect, 5-ht2b receptors do not
appear to mediate colonic hypersensitivity. we conclude that  xxxg1114xxx -mediated mechanisms are
unlikely to play a role in the antihyperalgesic action of
 xxxd3302xxx  in man.

introduction
 xxxd3302xxx , an  xxxd2951xxx  indole acting as a
partial agonist of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, is approved for the
treatment of women with constipation-predominant
irritable bowel syndrome (ibs)1 and for both men and
women with chronic constipation.2 the receptormediated mechanism(s) underlying the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3302xxx  were recently questioned in a study
that described a high-affinity interaction of  xxxd3302xxx 
with both human recombinant and non-human 5-ht2b
receptors.3 the same study also described functional
evidence for a potent  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist
activity using in vitro animal tissue assays, and at
human recombinant 5-ht2b receptors expressed in
cho-k1 cells. these findings were in agreement with
the binding profile of the  xxxd3302xxx . however, it
appears from more recent studies in human intestine4 that the functional interaction of  xxxd3302xxx 
with the human native  xxxg1114xxx  is rather less
potent than predicted by earlier studies in animals
and recombinant systems. of particular relevance
however are findings demonstrating that 5-ht2b
receptor activation by 5-ht enhances responses to
n-methyl-d-aspartate in frog spinal motorneurones.5
if a similar system exists in visceral afferent nerves,
activation of 5-ht2b receptors by 5-ht in the bowel
wall could play a role in the visceral hyperalgesia
which is thought to be a predominant factor in the
pathophysiology of functional bowel disorders such
as ibs. furthermore, under such conditions, antagonism of 5-ht2b receptors may result in a reduction of
hyperalgesia.

neurogastroenterology and motility

in our recent studies6 in rats with acetic acidinduced colonic hypersensitivity, an acute hypersensitivity lasting a few hours, we noted that a component
of the antihyperalgesic effect of  xxxd3302xxx  was insensitive to blockade by the selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
antagonists gr113808 or sb203186. this suggested to
us that a non- xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated action of  xxxd3302xxx  probably plays a role in its overall antihyperalgesic
effect in rats with visceral hyperalgesia. therefore, the
goal of the current study was to examine whether
 xxxg1114xxx -mediated mechanisms affect colonic
sensitivity. to address this goal we studied the effects
of selective  xxxg1114xxx  agents in the same rat
model of visceral hyperalgesia in which  xxxd3302xxx  had
demonstrable efficacy.

from multiple rats (n ¼ 6 rats/group) was expressed as
the mean ± standard error of the mean (sem). statistical significance was assessed between different drug
treatment and vehicle control within the same rat
using student’s paired t-test. statistical significance
was assigned if p < 0.05. the vmr data was expressed
as a percentage of maximum distension pressure in the
vehicle control group.

results
sensitization with acetic acid produced a 1.6- to 1.9fold increase in the vmr, quantified as the number of
abdominal muscle contractions, at all distension pressures (0, 15, 30, 45, 60 mmhg) when compared with
the normosensitive rat, which indicated the presence
of visceral hyperalgesia. however, when hyperalgesic
animals were studied following administration of the
selective 5-ht2b antagonist, sb 204741 at doses of 3, 10
and 30 mg kg)1 i.p. (n ¼ 6 rats/dose) there was no
significant affect on the heightened vmr response in
the animals with sensitized colons (fig. 1a–c). in a
subset of rats (n ¼ 6), the effect of the combined 5ht2b/2c antagonist sb206553 (5 mg kg)1 i.p.) was
found to cause a significant exacerbation of the vmr
response in the animals with sensitized colons
(fig. 1d). finally in rats with sensitized colons given
the selective 5-ht2b agonist bw723c86 (10 mg kg)1
i.p.), there was no significant difference in the vmr
compared with vehicle-treated controls (100% dmso)
at all distension pressures (15 mmhg ¼ 42.5 ± 7.0%
vs 39.8 ± 3.9%; 30 mmhg ¼ 52.0 ± 4.6% vs 65.0 ±
4.2%; 45 mmhg ¼ 79.3 ± 3.7% vs 83.3 ± 5.3%;
60 mmhg ¼ 93.9 ± 4.4% vs 100 ± 6.7%).

materials and methods
the detailed methods for these studies have been
described previously. briefly, male sprague–dawley
rats (250–400 g) were fasted with free access to water
for 14–18 h prior to study. on the day of experiment
rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane (2–3%) and a
strain gauge force transducer was sutured to the
external oblique muscle. barostat-controlled distension of the distal colon was performed in freely moving
animals according to a protocol involving 10-min
distensions at constant pressures of 0, 15, 30, 45 and
60 mmhg separated by 10-min intervals without distension. the number of abdominal muscle contractions during each distension period, measured using
the strain gauge connected to a dc pre-amplifier, was
used to measure the visceromotor response (vmr).
acute colonic hypersensitivity was induced by intracolonic infusion of dilute acetic acid (0.6%, 1.5 ml).
following induction of colonic hypersensitivity, all
rats received the vehicle control and then underwent a
graded series of colonic distensions and the vmr
recorded. after a 60-min recovery, the effects of the
 xxxg1114xxx  agonist bw 723c86 (10 mg kg)1, i.p.,
vehicle 100% dmso); 5-ht2b antagonist sb204741
(3, 10, 30 mg kg)1, i.p., vehicle 100% dmso) and the
5-ht2b/2c antagonist sb206553 (5 mg kg)1, i.p.,
vehicle 50 : 50 v/v millipore water and 0.9% nacl.),
were studied by administration 30 min prior to vmr
testing in acid-induced hyperalgesic animals. these
specific compounds were selected based upon their in
vitro activity at the  xxxg1114xxx . moreover, the
doses used in the current study have been shown to be
effective, most likely thought a central site of action,
in other in vivo rodent behavioural assays. following
dosing, the number of abdominal contractions for each
10 min distension period was determined and the data

discussion
our previous studies6 demonstrated that  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are involved in the visceral antihyperalgesic effects
of  xxxd3302xxx  because a significant part of this activity
was inhibited by  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonists. we were
not able to investigate whether the remainder of this
activity was  xxxg1114xxx -mediated by blocking the
effect of  xxxd3302xxx  with a  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist,
as the proposed additional activity of  xxxd3302xxx  was
itself antagonistic at these receptors. instead, we
examined the effect of a range of  xxxg1114xxx 
ligands under the same experimental conditions that
were used to demonstrate the effect of  xxxd3302xxx  as the
hypothesis would necessitate a  xxxg1114xxx -mediated induction of hyperalgesia in this model. in the
current study, we found no evidence of  xxxg1114xxx 
modulation of colorectal hypersensitivity in this

5-ht2b receptors and colorectal sensitivity

 xxxd3302xxx -sensitive assay. although we cannot exclude
the possibility that activation of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in
some way unmasks a role for 5-ht2b receptors in this
hypersensitive system, we know of no evidence, or
previous scientific hypothesis, that would suggest such
an interaction of the two receptors. we can also not
exclude the possibility that the  xxxg1114xxx  activity of  xxxd3302xxx  could play a role in more chronic
visceral hyperalgesia. we conclude therefore that
5-ht2b receptors do not play a part in colorectal
visceral hyperalgesia produced in a rodent model of
colonic hypersensitivity, the same model in which
 xxxd3302xxx  has previously been shown to produce a
potent antihyperalgesic effect.6 based upon our findings in a rodent model, we suggest that it is unlikely
that antagonism of 5-ht2b receptors is directly
involved in the visceral antihyperalgesic effect of
 xxxd3302xxx  observed in patients with ibs.
