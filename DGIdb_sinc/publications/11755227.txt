abstract
 xxxd3564xxx  (zns) is a generally well tolerated anticonvulsant that has beneficial effects on parkinson’s disease (pd). zns (300
mg/day) given to a patient with pd who incidentally had convulsive attacks, ameliorated the attacks and, surprisingly, his
parkinsonian symptoms. we, therefore, carried out an open trial of zns on nine patients with pd. patients were given 50–200
mg/day zns in addition to their anti-pd drugs. seven clearly showed lessening of symptoms, especially wearing-off. we speculate
that long lasting activation of dopamine synthesis by zns ameliorates parkinsonian symptoms, in particular wearing-off. © 2001

 xxxd3564xxx  (zns) is an antiepileptic with a benzisoxole structure (masuda et al., 1998) and a long
half-life (63 h) (ito et al., 1982). it was discovered in
japan and has been used for more than 10 years to
treat intractable epilepsy (usual dosage; 300 – 600 mg/
day) and is generally well tolerated. by chance we
found that zns has beneficial effects like those of a
long-lasting levodopa on parkinson’s disease (pd).
a 58-year-old man first experienced right arm tremor
about 10 years ago. although levodopa had a good
effect on his symptoms at first, rigidity, akinesia and
postural instability gradually worsened. in january
2000, he incidentally experienced convulsion attacks
and was given 300 mg/day zns, after which they
subsided. surprisingly, his parkinsonian symptoms also
were lessened (before zns; yahr iv.5, after zns;
iii.5). based on this finding, we performed an open
trial of zns on a group of parkinsonian patients.
nine patients (seven men and two women) with
advanced pd consented to participate in this study

after permission was given for it by the tokyo university ethical committee and full disclosure was made of
its potential risks and benefits. the average patient age
was 57.0 years, average duration of illness 9.7 years and
mean disease severity (‘off’ time, yahr stage) 3.6 (table
1). motor fluctuation was detected in all but two patients for whom levodopa had not been very effective
from the first stage of therapy (patients 6 and 10).
patients were given 50–200 mg zns once or twice daily
in addition to their anti-pd drugs (levodopa, da agonist, selegyline, etc.). after 12 weeks of zns administration, their conditions were assessed based on the
unified parkinson’s disease rating scale (updrs),
hoehn –yahr stage and ‘off’ time per day (measured by
patient-kept diaries). the paired t-test was used for
statistical analysis.
the cardinal symptoms of pd showed definite amelioration, especially in the patients with motor fluctuation. the beneficial effects of zns taken once a day
continued all day long, and motor fluctuation all but
disappeared in five patients (patients 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9).
the updrs (part ii; activities of daily living) of ‘off’
time, updrs (part iii; motor examination), yahr
stage of ‘off’ time and duration of ‘off’ time significantly improved (p b 0.001, 0.01, 0.001 and 0.001, respectively, fig. 1). the updrs (ii) of ‘on’ also

improved but not significantly. the mean updrs (ii)
and yahr stage of ‘off’ time clearly improved (22.3 to
12.3 and 3.8 to 2.8, respectively) and, surprisingly, the
mean ‘off’ time was shortened (5.9 to 1.2 h). these
effects appeared within 3– 7 days and have been maintained for more than 1 year. two patients (patients 6
and 10) whose responses to levodopa were poor from
the first also had poor responses to zns (table 2).
adverse effects noted were the exaggeration of dyskinesia (n= 4), dry mouth (n =1) and the exaggeration of
dyskinesia was disappeared by reducing levodopa dose.
the most commonly reported adverse effects of zns as
an anti-epileptic (300– 600 mg/day) are sleepiness,
anorexia and drowsiness (seino and ito, 1997).
concerning the possible mechanisms of zns on
parkinsonian symptoms, okada et al. (1995) reported

that the chronic administration of therapeutic doses of
zns increased dopamine levels in the striata of normal
rats, and zns-induced increases in dopamine were
greater intracellularly than extracellularly. we re-confirmed that zns increases the dopamine concentration
in rat striatum in addition to  xxxg2276xxx 
activity (under preparation for publication). zns has
very weak monoamine oxydase b ( xxxg1358xxx )-inhibiting
activity (ic50; 600 mm) (okada et al., 1995). it had no
effect on da re-uptake (okada et al., 1995) or on the
dopamine d1 and d2 receptors (data not shown). we,
therefore, speculate that the action of zns on pd is
mainly enhancement of dopamine synthesis. the relationship between parkinsonian symptoms and activities
of glutamate (engber et al., 1994) is suspected. in
addition, glutamate release is reported to be reduced by

zns (okada et al., 1998). therefore, it may be possible
to suppose the beneficial effects of zns on pd could be
related to glutamate activities. however, there is no
direct evidence to favor this hypothesis. furthermore, it
is possible to speculate that the beneficial effects of
zns on pd could correlate with the mechanism of an
anticonvulsant effect, no other anticonvulsant has been
reported to improve symptoms of parkinsonian patients
at the moment.
the therapeutic dose of zns for pd seems to be
much less than that needed for epilepsy. we claim that
zns is an effective and safe treatment for pd. a
controlled study is now in progress.
