summary: we examined the effects of prolonged oral ad-
ministration of  xxxd2812xxx  (twice daily for 6 weeks) to
male sprague-dawley rats. at two times (1 or 16-18 h)
after the last oral dose, the rats were anaesthetised and
subjected to acute coronary artery ligation, and the se-
verity of the resulting arrhythmias was assessed. isch-
aemic damage was measured histochemically (using
frozen section analysis by toluidine blue dye in nitro-
bluetetrazolium) and by myocardial enzyme release. car-
diac muscle (atria and papillary muscle) was also re-
moved and the transmembrane action potentials recorded
using conventional microelectrode techniques. when cor-
onary artery ligation was performed 1 h after the last oral
dose (at which time there was evidence of substantial
myocardial b,-adrenoceptor blockade), there was signif-

icant reduction in the severity of early arrhythmias, but
no evidence that the severity of ischaemic damage was
reduced or that the intracellular cardiac action potentials
were modified. no protection was observed when coro-
nary artery ligation was carried out 16 h after the last oral
dose of  xxxd2812xxx . these results support our previous
studies with acutely administered b-adrenoceptor
blocking drugs that myocardial b-adrenoceptor blockade
is the main factor involved in the protection afforded by
such drugs against early ischaemic arrhythmias and that
other possible effects, such as membrane stabilisation
and action potential prolongation, are relatively unim-
portant in this model. key words: chronic administra-
tion— xxxd2812xxx — arrhythmias— ischaemic damage—
electrophysiology.

 

vaughan williams and colleagues (1,2) have been
largely responsible for providing evidence that the
prolonged administration of drugs causes cardio-
vascular and other changes that might not be pre-
dicted from acute administration. for example,
after prolonged administration of b-adrenoceptor
blocking drugs, there are adaptive changes in the
myocardium (3,4), including a marked increase in
the volume of vascular elements and a prolongation
of action potential duration in both atrial and ven-
tricular muscle (2,5). this effect on the action po-
tential increases the refractory period and suggests

that b-adrenoceptor blocking agents could have a
‘*slow-onset class three antiarrhythmic action”’
(5,6). on the basis of these studies, the suggestion
has been made that some of these adaptive changes
(especially the prolongation of action potential du-
ration) might contribute to the protection afforded
by b-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in patients with
myocardial infarction, for example, in secondary
prevention (7).

up to the present time this hypothesis has not
been directly tested experimentally. thus, although
there is good evidence that prolonged b-adreno-

ceptor blockade in rats [ xxxd2957xxx ,  xxxd2812xxx  (8,9)]
and dogs [atenolol (10)] reduces the severity of the
immediate (early) arrhythmias that result from
acute coronary artery ligation, this protective effect
has not been correlated with the degree (if any) of
b-blockade, with any adaptive changes in the action
potential, or with the severity of myocardial isch-
aemic injury. it was the purpose of the present
studies to examine these relationships.

methods

coronary artery ligation in anaesthetised rats

the method was similar to that previously used in this
department (11). male sprague-dawley rats (weight range,
200-250 g) were anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbi-
tone (60 mg kg~! by intraperitoneal injection). anaes-
thesia was maintained throughout the experimental pe-
riod by further (3 mg) intravenous injections of sodium
pentobarbitone as required. following anaesthesia a can-
nula was inserted into the aorta via the right carotid artery
for arterial blood pressure recording using a capacitance
transducer (elema-schénander, type emt 35). a second
cannula was inserted into the inferior vena cava via the
right femoral vein for drug administration. the trachea
was intubated and a thermocouple was inserted into the
rectum for the measurement of body temperature. the
electrocardiogram was recorded using standard limb
leads. arterial blood pressure and the electrocardiogram
were monitored continuously on an oscilloscope (racal
instruments ltd.) and recorded using a mingograph 81
ink-jet recorder (elema-schénander). heart rate was cal-
culated from the electrocardiogram.

a left thoracotomy was then performed at the fourth
or fifth intercostal space, and the animal was artificially
respired using a palmer small animal respiration pump.
the stroke volume was 2 ml 100 g~! body weight and the
rate 54 strokes min~'. the pericardium was opened to
allow access to the heart, which was brought to the ex-
terior by gentle, downward pressure on the sternum. a
6/0 (metric 0.7) braided silk suture attached to a 10-mm
reverse cutting needle (ethicon 812) was passed through
the myocardium and under the left main coronary artery
at a point close to its origin. the heart was repositioned
within the thorax and the animal was allowed to stabilise
for 15 min. any animal that showed a sustained fall in
mean arterial blood pressure to <70 mm hg (9.2 kpa) or
that developed arrhythmias during this period was not
studied further. after the stabilisation period, the ligature
was tied and the arterial blood pressure and electrocar-
diogram was recorded for at least 30 min.

rats subjected to the above procedure exhibit two dis-
tinct periods of arrhythmic activity: an early phase lasting
for up to 30 min and a second delayed phase beginning
from 30 to 90 min after ligation. in this study both ‘‘early”’
(0-30 min) and ‘‘late’’ (30 min to 4 h) ventricular arrhyth-
mias were assessed. the total number of ventricular ec-
topic beats over these periods was counted together with
the incidence (%) and duration (s) of ventricular tachy-
cardia (vt; defined as seven or more consecutive ven-
tricular ectopic beats) and of ventricular fibrillation (vf;
which usually reverts spontaneously to sinus rhythm in
this species). tables ! and 2 show the arrhythmias as-
sessed in these ways in those rats that survived the ob-

servation period, together with the total incidence of vf
(i.e., including those animals that died) and the mortality.
the effects of coronary artery ligation were examined in
three main groups of rats. either  xxxd2812xxx  (2 or 50 mg
kg~') or saline (1 ml kg~') was administered orally (by
means of a stomach tube) twice daily (morning and eve-
ning) for 6 weeks. in those experiments in which possible
antiarrhythmic activity was assessed | h after the last oral
dose, this was given on the morning of the experiment.
the experiments using the larger  xxxd2812xxx  dose were
performed at two different times of the year, in the spring
and autumn of 1980. not all of the experiments planned
could be performed in the first group because of an out-
break of pneumonia in the animal house. the experiments
with the smaller dose of  xxxd2812xxx  are not described in
this article since there was no significant effect on any
studied parameter.

assessment of b-adrenoceptor blockade

rats were prepared for the measurement of heart rate
and arterial blood pressure, as above, and allowed to sta-
bilise for 15 min. at the end of the stabilisation period,
single doses of  xxxd2398xxx  hydrochloride (0.01-1 pg
kg~'in the controls and up to | mg kg~' in those animals
that were 8-blocked) were injected intravenously every
10 min. the resulting increases in heart rate and de-
creases in diastolic blood pressure were recorded.

determination of plasma and body tissue
 xxxd2812xxx  concentrations

at the appropriate times after dosing (1, 2, 4, 14, and
16 h after the last oral dose), the rats were anaesthetised,
and blood (8-10 ml) was removed from the carotid artery.
it was centrifuged at 2,000 g for 15 min, and the super-
natant was removed, frozen, and stored at —20°c. the
whole heart, aorta, portal vein, and liver were also re-
moved and stored at — 20°c. the concentrations of ox-
 xxxd240xxx  (ng kg!) were determined by dr. w. reiss and
mr. g. merge (department of pharmacological chem-
istry, ciba-geigy ltd., basle, switzerland) using a double
radioisotope technique. the lower limits of detection
were 5 ng g_! plasma and 25 ng g~! tissue homogenate.

assessment of myocardial ischaemic damage

the hearts of rats that were used for the assessment of
arrhythmias and that had survived for 4 h after coronary
artery ligation were removed, frozen in a mixture of ace-
tone and solid carbon dioxide, and processed according
to the method of clark et al. (11). the hearts were em-
bedded and sectioned using a bright model 5030 cryostat.
three sections, each of 20-4m thickness, were taken at
l-mm intervals from apex to base. one of these sections
was immersed in a solution of 0.1% toluidine blue in 0.1%
borax at room temperature for 30 s, rinsed, transferred
to 10% formal saline for 1 min, rinsed, and mounted for
general morphological analysis. the remaining two sec-
tions were used for histochemical staining for lactate de-
hydrogenase (ldh) and nadph  xxxg641xxx  (11).

photographs were taken of these sections to give a final
magnification of 12, and each section was measured,
using a reichert-jung map amo3 analyser, for total area
and normal areas of the left ventricle and intraventricular
septum. the difference between these two measurements
was taken as the area of infarcted left ventricle and ex-
pressed as a percentage of total area.

assessment of plasma enzyme activity

enzyme leakage during the course of ischaemia was
assessed by removing arterial blood (0.5 ml) from an-
aesthetised rats 15 min before and 2 and 4 h after coro-
nary artery ligation. the rats had received either saline
or  xxxd2812xxx  for 6 weeks (see above), and the coronary
artery was ligated | h after the last oral dose. these an-
imals were used solely for the assessment of enzyme
leakage, since this involved an alteration in experimental
procedure and removal of blood. plasma was stored at
4°c and creatine kinase (ck) and ldh-1-isoenzyme
(ldh,) were assayed using standard boehringer test kits.

assessment of  xxxd2812xxx  treatment on
intracellular cardiac action potentials and on
isolated atria

hearts were rapidly removed from rats chronically
treated with either saline or  xxxd2812xxx  and were placed
in cold krebs solution. the paired atria and a papillary
muscle from the left ventricle were dissected from the
heart, pinned to the silastic base of a recording chamber,
and superfused at a rate of 10 ml min! with krebs so-
lution equilibrated with 95% o.,/5% co,. the composition

of the krebs solution was (in mm): nacl, 119.6;
nahco,, 25; nah;po,, 1.2; kcl, 4.7; mgcl,, 0.57;
 xxxg2125xxx ,, 2.5; and glucose, 5.5. the temperature was main-
tained at 35 + 1°c. the atria and papillary muscle were
stimulated at frequencies of 4 and 1 hz, respectively, by
rectangular pulses | ms in duration and twice threshold
voltage, delivered through a bipolar silver electrode.
transmembrane action potentials were recorded using
conventional microelectrode techniques. the parameters
measured were resting membrane potential, action po-
tential amplitude, maximum rate of depolarisation, and
the action potential duration at both 50 and 90% repolar-
isation levels. recording of the action potentials from
both tissues was completed within | h of excision.

in another series of experiments, right atria from sim-
ilarly pretreated animals were mounted in modified krebs
solution (as above except that the mgcl, concentration
was 1.2 mm) at 32°c and equilibrated with 95% o,/5%
co,. the atria were placed under a tension of 0.5 g and
allowed to stabilise for 30 min. at the end of this period,
the spontaneous rate was measured over | min. the atria
were then stimulated with rectangular pulses of 5-ms du-
ration at twice threshold voltage and a frequency of 4 hz.

the frequency of stimulation was steadily increased until
the preparations would no longer follow the stimuli (max-
imum following frequency). the refractory period was
calculated as the reciprocal of the maximum following
frequency.

other atria, set up as above, were used to assess
whether chronic  xxxd2812xxx  treatment altered the resis-
tance of cardiac muscle to acute hypoxia. the method
used was that of parratt and marshall (12). in brief, ten-
sion was recorded isometrically using dynameter strain
gauge transducers and devices two-channel recorders:
the gassing mixture was replaced by 95% n,/5% co). the
effect was to decrease contractile force. the times taken
to reach 25, 50, and 75% of resting tension were recorded.
samples were taken for ph and po, analysis using an
instrumentation laboratory blood gas analyser.

determination of water content of hearts

hearts were removed from rats pretreated as described
above, dried using filter paper, and weighed. they were
then placed in a vacuum oven at 60°c for 48 h and re-
weighed.

statistical analysis

data are expressed as means + sem. the statistical
significance of differences between mean values was cal-
culated using student’s ¢ test, and a level of p < 0.05 was
considered significant. for evaluating the differences be-
tween the incidence of vt, vf, and mortality, a x? test
was used.

results

effect of chronic  xxxd2812xxx  treatment on
systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate

both blood pressure and heart rate were reduced
by chronic  xxxd2812xxx  treatment, but only if deter-
mined 1 h after the last oral dose. for example,
mean arterial blood pressure was reduced from 132
+ 6mm hg (17.6 + 0.8 kpa; in the control, chronic
saline-treated rats) to 111 + 5 mm hg (14.8 + 0.67
kpa; p < 0.05) and heart rate from 435 + 13 to 393
+ 13 beats min~! (p < 0.05). sixteen hours after
the last oral dose, there was no significant effect on
either parameter [140 + 9 mm hg (18.6 + 1.2 kpa)
and 425 + 14 beats min™! in the controls and 138
+ 5 mm hg (18.4 + 0.67 kpa) and 420 = 11 beats
min~! in the  xxxd2812xxx -treated group].

effects of chronic  xxxd2812xxx  treatment on
incidence and severity of arrhythmias resulting
from acute coronary artery ligation

coronary artery ligation in anaesthetised rats re-
sults in two distinct periods of arrhythmic activity
(11). this is illustrated in fig. 1. there is an early
phase, lasting for 20-25 min, in which ventricular
ectopic activity is particularly pronounced and
during which there is a high incidence of both vt
(100%) and vf (50-60%); this is often self-termi-
nating. there is then a variable period usually of
~45—60 min, during which ventricular ectopic ac-

j cardiovasc pharmacol, vol. 6, no. 3, 1984

tivity is uncommon. this is followed by further ar-
rhythmic activity, of variable severity, lasting sev-
eral hours (late phase arrhythmias; fig. 1).

two separate studies were performed with ox-
 xxxd240xxx , one in the spring and one in the autumn
of 1980. there was a remarkable similarity in the
results of these two studies. they showed that
when coronary artery ligation was carried out | h
after the last oral  xxxd2812xxx  dose, ventricular ar-
rhythmias in the early phase were less severe than
in rats treated orally for the same (6-week) period
with saline. this was particularly true of vf. when
the two studies are combined (table 1), there was
a significant reduction during the early phase in the
incidence of vt and vf and in mortality but not in
the number of ventricular ectopic beats. the inci-
dence of vt and of vf was also somewhat reduced
during the late phase (0.5—4 h), although the only
statistically significant effect observed was a reduc-
tion in the incidence of vf in the survivors pre-
treated with the drug.

when coronary artery ligation was carried out
16-18 h after the last oral dose,  xxxd2812xxx  treat-
ment had no significant effect on any of the ar-
rhythmic indices (tables 1 and 2).

determination of degree of b-blockade in rats
treated with  xxxd2812xxx 

this dose of  xxxd2812xxx  (50 mg kg~') resulted in
a marked shift in  xxxd2398xxx  dose-response curves
for heart rate and diastolic blood pressure when
these were assessed | h afterward. this shift was
800-fold (for the decrease in diastolic blood pressure
induced by  xxxd2398xxx ) and rather less (100-fold)
for  xxxd2398xxx -induced tachycardia. when the
studies were carried out 16 h after the termination
of  xxxd2812xxx  treatment, there was no significant
reduction in the responses to  xxxd2398xxx ; indeed,
there was some evidence that the curves were
shifted slightly to the left.

concentrations of  xxxd2812xxx  in plasma and tissue
of rats after chronic treatment

a group of 10 rats was used; these were killed 1,
2, 4, 8, and 16 h after the last  xxxd2812xxx  dose.
plasma concentrations were substantial [the mean
of 136 ng ml~' at 1 h reached a peak at 2 h (460 ng
ml~!) and declined thereafter (51 ng ml~! at 4 h; 18
ng ml~! at 18 h)]. myocardial levels were always
considerably higher than plasma levels at each of
these times (i.e., 709, 1,898, 95, and 21 ng g™!, re-
spectively), and the highest levels were found in the
aorta (mean values of 2,663, 2,156, 549, and 334 ng
gat 1, 2, 4, and 16 h, respectively) and in liver
(mean values of 3,891, 4,007, 1,051, and 703 ng g~!,
respectively). clearly, then, substantial amounts of
 xxxd2812xxx  were present both in the heart and in
major vessels | and 2 h after the last oral  xxxd2812xxx

effect of chronic  xxxd2812xxx  treatment on
myocardial ischaemic damage

two assessments of ischaemic damage were
used: the histochemical assessment of infarct size,
using frozen section analysis by toluidine blue dye
or nitrobluetetrazolium (following either the loss of
ldh or nadph  xxxg641xxx ), and the increase in
the plasma levels of ldh, and of ck. the results
given in tables 3 and 4 indicate that chronic pre-
treatment with  xxxd2812xxx  did not reduce either in-
farct size (assessed histochemically) or enzyme loss

refractory period of isolated cardiac muscle and

the studies on the effects on the refractory pe-
riod of isolated cardiac muscle and on the response
of isolated atria to acute hypoxia were carried out
in rats from which the heart was removed 16 h after
the last oral dose. in drug-pretreated hearts the
spontaneous atrial rate was slightly less (199 + 10
vs 226 + 8 beats min~'), but no differences were
observed in the force developed (73 + 12 mg in the
controls and 94 + 17 mg in the  xxxd2812xxx -treated
group) or in the refractory period (52.4 + 1.5 ms in

atria subjected to acute hypoxia to fall by 25, 50,

191 + 17s in the  xxxd2812xxx -treated group, respec-
tively).

effect of chronic  xxxd2812xxx  treatment on
intracellular cardiac action potentials

tables 5 and 6 summarise the effects of oxpren-
olol treatment on the electrophysiological charac-
teristics (resting membrane potential, action poten-
tial amplitude and duration, and maximum rate of
depolarisation) of both atria and papillary muscle
removed from rats either | or 16 h after the last oral
 xxxd2812xxx  dose. in hearts removed | h after the
last oral dose, there were no significant differences
in any measured parameter; 16h after the last dose,
the action potential duration was slightly, although
significantly, increased in papillary muscle paced
at 1 hz.

effect of chronic  xxxd2812xxx  treatment on heart
weight-to-body weight ratio and myocardial
water content

the heart weight-to-body weight ratio and myo-
cardial water content were unchanged by chronic

 xxxd2812xxx  treatment. the ratio (mg:g) was 3.15 +
0.13 and the water content 75.9 + 0.3% (n = 13)
in the controls and 3.22 + 0.09 and 76.5 + 0.5% (n
= 17), respectively, in the  xxxd2812xxx -treated rats.

discussion

the main point to arise from these studies was
the significant decrease in the incidence and se-
verity of early ischaemic ventricular arrhythmias
following prolonged pretreatment with  xxxd2812xxx .
this was particularly so with respect to vf (table
1). the incidences of ventricular ectopic beats and
of vt were rather lower in the  xxxd2812xxx -treated
animals, but  xxxd3159xxx  was the antifibrillatory effect
that was most pronounced and that resulted in the
significant decrease in mortality during the early
phase of ischaemia from 35 to 5%. this protection
can, we believe, be accounted for by b-blockade
rather than by any long-term ‘‘adaptive change.”’
the evidence for this conclusion is as follows.

(a) our previous studies (13) involving the acute
(single-dose) administration of the d- and /-isomers
of  xxxd2812xxx  demonstrated clearly that the antiar-
rhythmic activity (ventricular ectopic beats; vt) in
this same experimental model resided almost en-
tirely in the /-isomer. this was considerably more
active as a b-blocker than the d-isomer.

(b) at the times (i.e., | h after the last oral ox-
prenolo! dose) when antiarrhythmic activity was

marked, there was a significant degree of 8,-adre-
noceptor blockade present, as assessed by a 100-
fold shift in  xxxd2398xxx  dose-response curves, a
significant bradycardia (30-40 beats min~'), pre-
sumably the result of b-blockade, and systemic hy-
potension (of 20 mm hg).

the case against the importance of adaptive
changes in cardiac muscle action potentials or of an
effect of long-term  xxxd2812xxx  treatment on the
rapid inward sodium current [a class | effect in the
vaughan williams classification (6)] consists of the
following.

(a) no protection is observed if coronary artery
ligation is carried out 16 h after the last  xxxd2812xxx 
dose, i.e., at a time when there is no evidence of
myocardial b-adrenoceptor blockade.

(b) at a time when early postligation arrhythmias
were suppressed (1 h after the last oral dose), there
was no evidence of changes in action potential du-
ration (table 6).

(c) a slight (10%) but statistically significant in-
crease in action potential at both 50 and 90% re-
polarisation levels was observed in papillary muscle
(but not atrial muscle) removed from rats 16 h after
the last  xxxd2812xxx  dose. this confirms the reports
of the vaughan williams group (2,5), albeit in an-
other species (rabbits), that the prolonged admin-
istration of various b-adrenoceptor blocking drugs
( xxxd2991xxx ,  xxxd58xxx , and, in one of two studies,
propranolol) can result in prolongation of the action
potential. however, we observed this only in pap-
illary muscle, and the effect was very small. it
seems doubtful whether prolongation of the action
potential to the degree (+ 10%) observed in our
studies is of importance with respect to ischaemic
arrhythmias. this is because there was no in vivo
evidence of antiarrhythmic activity at this time.
this prolongation of the action potential was not
observed 1 h after  xxxd2812xxx  administration, pos-
sibly as a result of the acute effect of the drug to
slightly shorten the action potential, as described
by vaughan williams and papp (14).

(d) there was no evidence that prolonged ox-
 xxxd240xxx  treatment had any significant effect on the
rapid na~ current in cardiac muscle (membrane

stabilising effect; tables 5 and 6). vaughan williams
and papp (14) demonstrated that when  xxxd2812xxx 
was added to fluid bathing rabbit atrial muscle,
there was a marked dose-related decrease in the
maximum rate of depolarisation. indeed, this class
1 action was more marked than that of quinidine
(14) and was observed in concentrations as low as
0.3 mg l~!. it is, of course, difficult to extrapolate
from effects observed in vitro, when  xxxd2812xxx  is
added to physiological salt solutions, to possible in
vivo plasma (or myocardial) drug concentrations.
we do, however, know the plasma and myocardial
concentrations of  xxxd2812xxx  at the time (1 h after
the last oral dose) at which the cardiac muscle was
removed for in vitro studies (136 ng ml! plasma
and 700 ng g~! myocardium). these are, of course,
much lower than the minimum concentration (0.3
mg l~!) used in the study of vaughan williams and
papp (14); indeed, they would be lower still if
binding to plasma proteins were taken into consid-
eration.

although there is evidence that a class | effect of
b-blockers can be more pronounced in ischaemic
(‘‘depressed’’) cells (15), we think it is reasonable
to conclude from these in vivo studies, and from
our own previous studies with single-dose oxpren-
olol administration (13), that membrane stabilisa-
tion (or a class | antiarrhythmic action) does not
contribute to an important degree to the protection
afforded by this drug against early ischaemic ar-
rhythmias. certainly the main protection, at least
against early ischaemic arrhythmias, is due to myo-
cardial b-adrenoceptor blockade. a similar conclu-
sion arose from studies showing that chronic treat-
ment of rats with  xxxd2957xxx  (8) (10 days of treatment),
and of dogs with atenolol [5 days of treatment (10)]
markedly increased the survival rate after acute
coronary artery occlusion. in the atenolol study this
protective effect was dose related and depended on
the degree of myocardial b-blockade (10). it is also
relevant that neither  xxxd2957xxx  nor atenolol possesses
significant membrane-stabilising activity.

the present studies reemphasise the importance
of the activation of the sympathetic nervous system
in the genesis of early ischaemic arrhythmias, a sub-

ject recently discussed in detail (16). if studies in
rats could be extrapolated to the clinical situation,
they would suggest that the main (only?) factor in-
volved in the protection afforded, in secondary pre-
vention trials, by  xxxd3377xxx ,  xxxd2991xxx ,  xxxd123xxx , pro-
 xxxd3033xxx , and metoprolol against sudden cardiac
death is due to the ability of these drugs to block
myocardial b-adrenoceptors. further, it could be
argued that this protection is lost when adreno-
ceptor blockade is inadequate and that there is no
‘‘carry-over effect.’’ the patient group that is par-
ticularly interesting is the one in which patients
have died suddenly, presumably from vf, while re-
ceiving b-blocker therapy. it would be of interest to
determine when, after their last oral dose, they had
the fatal attack (i.e., were they adequately b-
blocked?). this is not, of course, to suggest that
catecholamine release is the only factor involved in
the genesis of these life-threatening early arrhyth-
mias. the importance of other factors, such as myo-
cardial thromboxane release (17,18), suggests that
for a greater degree of protection, drug combina-
tions are indicated (19).

on the other hand, in view of the fact that the rat
ventricular action potential is different from that of
larger animals and humans, it may be that pro-
longed b-blockade cannot induce the same degree
of adaptational lengthening of the action potential
in the rat as is observed in the rabbit. hence, spe-
cies variation may underlie the differences observed
in the rat and the rabbit in the adaptive changes
during prolonged b-blockade.

chronic  xxxd2812xxx  treatment was less effective
against the later postischaemic ventricular arrhyth-
mias (table 2), although a reduction in the incidence
of vf in the survivors was noted when experiments
were carried out | h after the last oral dose. it may
be that b-blockade was not completely adequate at
this time, since plasma and myocardial tissue levels
of  xxxd2812xxx  had fallen somewhat by 4 h after the
last oral dose. a more recent study in this model
with metoprolol given intravenously 15 min before
coronary ligation did demonstrate marked suppres-
sion of late arrhythmic activity (20), suggesting that
these arrhythmias are sensitive to b-adrenoceptor
blocking agents.

despite evidence of a substantial degree of myo-
cardial b-adrenoceptor blockade at the time of cor-
onary artery ligation, chronic pretreatment with ox-
 xxxd240xxx  failed to modify either enzyme leakage (as
assessed by arterial blood levels of ldh and ck)
or infarct size (as assessed, at 4h, by three distinct
histochemical methods). we know of no other rel-
evant experimental studies on long-term b-blockade
and myocardial infarct development. the closest
are those of manning, hearse, and others (21-23)
at the rayne institute. they treated rats with a va-
riety of b-adrenoceptor blocking drugs for periods

j cardiovasc pharmacol, vol. 6, no. 3, 1984

of up to 12 weeks, and, at various times after the
last oral dose, killed the animals, excised the hearts,
perfused them using a modified langendorff pro-
cedure (isolated working heart preparation), and
subjected them to a 30-min period of reduced flow.
this is, of course, a very different technique from
the in vivo one used in the present study; the hearts
were isolated, devoid of neural influences, perfused
with a physiological salt solution rather than blood
(which, on occasion, contained  xxxd2398xxx  or
adrenaline to provide *‘exogenous catecholamine
drive’’), and subjected, not to coronary artery li-
gation, but to ‘‘global hypoperfusion.’’ despite the
marked differences in experimental protocol, there
was also no evidence in isolated rat hearts that
chronic b-blockade protected the ischaemic myo-
cardium (22) as assessed by enzyme leakage or lac-
tate release. even in studies in which b-blocking
drugs were present in the perfusate (23), there was
very little evidence (e.g., from tissue atp and cre-
atine phosphate levels) that b-blockade modified
this form of ‘‘ischaemic”’ injury.

the most likely explanation for the failure of b-
blockade to modify enzyme release or infarct size
in these anaesthetised rat studies is the severity of
the model, with 40-50% of the left ventricle
showing changes indicative of severe ischaemic
damage (table 4). the results do not, of course,
relate to the possibility that b-adrenoceptor
blocking drugs reduce the severity and degree of
ischaemic damage under less drastic experimental
conditions. there is indeed good evidence for this
(24-27).
