a new antiarrhythmic agent, in canine cardiac tissues

summary: the intracellular electrophysiological prop-
erties of a new, orally effective antiarrhythmic agent, in-
decainide hydrochloride, were studied in isolated canine
myocardial preparations stimulated at 1 hz and super-
fused with tyrode’s solution. in purkinje fibers, inde-
cainide (10~® and 3 x 10°°m) decreased the maximal
rate of rise of phase 0 (v,,,,), conduction velocity, action
potential duration apd, and effective refractory period, and
shifted the membrane response curve by 5 mv in a hy-
perpolarizing direction. in papillary muscle, apd was un-
changed, but v,,,, was decreased. the effect of the drug
on v,,4x was rate dependent, but over physiologically rel-
evant cycle lengths (370 to 1,000 ms), v,,,, remained rel-
atively constant. in the presence of  xxxd2344xxx  (3 x
10-°m) and at a basic cycle length of 333 ms, the rate
constant for block onset was 0.06 and 0.1 action poten-
tials~' in purkinje fiber and papillary muscle, respec-

a decrease in the maximal rate of rise of phase 0
of the action potential (v,,,,), leading to a decrease
in conduction velocity, is characteristic of many es-
tablished antiarrhythmic drugs (1-5) and is espe-
cially prominent in many newly introduced agents
(6-8). however, it is now apparent that there are
also distinct differences among these agents in their
effects on the onset of and recovery from sodium
channel block (5,9,10) as well as on the degree of
resting block (11,12). for example, lidocaine shows
relative selectivity for depressing early premature
impulses (13) or those elicited at rapid rates (5,14),
while other compounds like disopyramide tend to
be nonselective in their depressant effects over a
relatively wide range of stimulation frequencies or
prematurity intervals (10). additionally, these com-
pounds can either shorten, lengthen, or only mini-
mally affect action potential duration (apd) (6,7).

tively. the recovery of v,,,, from maximum steady-state
block was half completed in purkinje fibers and muscle
in 52 and 49 s, respectively. no resting block was ap-
parent in either tissue at normal resting membrane po-
tential.  xxxd2344xxx  had only minimal effects on auto-
maticity arising from normal or depolarized (barium)
membrane potentials. thus,  xxxd2344xxx  is a potent class
i local anesthetic antiarrhythmic agent that depresses
vinax and conduction in cardiac tissues. the depressant
effects of  xxxd2344xxx  are completely dependent on prior
activation of the tissue, but because of its slow kinetics
for recovery from sodium channel block, little additional
change in v,,,, occurs within physiologically relevant
heart rates and prematurity intervals. key words: in-
decainide— sodium channel kinetics— purkinje fibers—
action potential— antiarrhythmic.

thus, it is clearly an oversimplification to group
together in one class all drugs that, for example,
have in common the ability to decrease v,,,. these
electrophysiological differences have necessitated
further subdivision of class i drugs (7), although the
most appropriate electrophysiological basis for
such subdivision is still unclear.

 xxxd2344xxx  hcl (9-(3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-
propyl)-9h-fluorene-9-carboxamide hydrochloride)
is a new, orally effective antiarrhythmic agent pos-
sessing the molecular structure shown in fig. 1.

 xxxd2344xxx  hci has been shown to be efficacious
in suppressing cardiac arrhythmias in a wide variety
of animal models (15). the objectives of the present
experiments were: 1) to investigate the general elec-
trophysiological properties of  xxxd2344xxx  in iso-
lated purkinje cells and ventricular muscle tissue
obtained from normal dogs and 2) to determine the

effect of this new compound on the onset and re-
covery kinetics of the sodium channel as reflected
by its effects on v,,,,. the information gained
should be helpful in understanding  xxxd2344xxx ’s
mechanism(s) of action as well as in placing this
new drug in context with other agents and within
existing classification schemes (7,16).

methods

adult mongrel dogs weighing between 8 and 15 kg were
anesthetized with 30 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, and
their hearts were removed. free-running false tendons,
the distal portions of the right or left bundle branches, or
ventricular papillary muscle were quickly dissected. tis-
sues were pinned to the bottom of a wax-lined bath and
continuously superfused (s—6 ml/min) with modified ty-
rode’s solution at 36 + 0.5°c having a ph of 7.4 and
aerated with 95% o, -5% co). the solution contained the
following ions (meq/l): na*, 156.7; k+, 4.0; mg*?, 1.0:
ca*?, 4.0; cl7', 145.9; h,po~‘, 1.8; hco-3, 18.0 and
glucose (5.5 mm). the tissues were stimulated through
bipolar teflon-coated stainless steel electrodes at a basic
cycle length of t,000 ms (unless otherwise specified) with
square wave pulses 0.5 ms duration at 1.5 times threshold
voltage (usually 4-6 v). intracellular potentials were re-
corded with glass microelectrodes filled with 3m kcl (5-
20 mq, dc resistance), connected to a high impedance
unity gain electrometer (w-p instruments, model 725, 2
x 107!° ©). tyrode’s solution was superfused over the
tissues for at least 1.5 h, while the action potential was
monitored to insure stability. electronic differentiation
(type 740 operational amplifier, field effect transistor
input) was used to obtain the maximum rate of rise of the
upstroke of the action potential (v,,,,). the output of the
amplifier was linear for upstroke velocities from 10 to
1,200 v/s. signals were displayed on a storage oscillo-
scope (tektronix model 564) and recorded photographi-
cally.

action potential duration and refractory period were
measured by an on-line computer (dec, pdp-11/45, cou-
pled to an analog/digital converter; sampling frequency
50 ws for 10 ms: then | ms for the next 800 ms). values
of apd were obtained at 70 (apd,») and 95 (apd,,)% of
full repolarization. cellular refractory period was deter-
mined by initiating premature stimuli (s,, twice the in-
tensity of s, impulses) various times after the basic
driving stimuli (s,) during the absolute refractory period.
the effective refractory period (erp) was defined as the
longest s,. s, interval in which s, failed to conduct to a

second recording electrode located distally in the same
purkinje strand.

the effect of drugs on membrane responsiveness (the
relationship between the maximal rate of rise of the pre-
mature impulse and the membrane potential from which
the impulse arose), was determined by inserting s, stimuli
various times during the repolarization phase of the ac-
tion potential. the expression ‘‘h’’ defined as the ratio
of v,,a, of the premature potential during repolarization
to the peak value of v,,,, obtained at maximum diastolic
potential was determined before and after  xxxd2344xxx .

use-dependent measurements _

the influence of  xxxd2344xxx  on v,,,, as a function of
stimulation frequency was examined in purkinje fibers
(6—10 preparations) by varying the cycle length of s, from
370 to 20,000 ms. sufficient time was allowed at each
cycle length to permit v,,,, to reach a new steady-state
value. the kinetics of the inhibition of v,,,, by inde-
cainide were studied in purkinje fibers (3—5 preparations)
and papillary muscle cells (four preparations) using trains
of s, stimuli at a basic cycle length (333 ms) and duration
(at least for 30 s) sufficient to cause maximal use- xxxd2870xxx -
dent block. to calculate the rate of onset of block, the
steady-state value of v,,,, obtained during maximum use-
dependent block was subtracted from the v,,,,, of the first
20 action potentials in a train elicited after a 5 min rest
period. the logarithm of this difference was plotted
against action potential number, and regression analysis
was used to calculate the exponential rate constant (ac-
tion potentials ~') describing block onset. recovery from
block was determined by plotting the log of the fraction
of unavailable sodium channels against the interval (1)
between trains (1-150 s). the fraction of unavailable so-
dium channels was calculated as, 1—[vimaxi) /vmaxcoy]>
where v,,,,, represents the v,,,, of the first action poten-
tial of a train elicited at time (1) after the end of a previous
train, and v,,,,;9) represents the v,,,, of the first action
potential in a train elicited 5 min after the end of a pre-
vious train. in papillary muscle studies, v,,,,;,) was mea-
sured directly. however, purkinje fibers undergo spon-
taneous diastolic depolarization, so that the first action
potential in a train elicited after several seconds of rest
often arises from more positive potentials than those later
in the train (see fig. 5). since the effect of membrane
potential on v,,,, is especially marked in the presence of
antiarrhythmic drugs (13), we minimized the influence of
changing membrane potential by estimating v,,.,,.) for
purkinje fibers as the intercept of the monoexponential
function describing the onset of rate-dependent block
(calculated as described above). this procedure elimi-
nated the need to measure directly the initial action po-
tential(s) in the train that arise from more depolarized
potentials.

automaticity

the effect of  xxxd2344xxx  on automaticity was studied
in purkinje fiber preparations whose diastolic potential
was normally polarized. these cells were either sponta-
neously discharging (n = 2) or were induced to fire au-
tomatically with 2 mm potassium ion (n = 1). in separate
studies (n = 3), we added 0.3 mm barium chloride to
the normal superfusion solution resulting in immediate
depolarization and the onset of a stable automatic

rhythm. in two experiments, nifedipine (3 x 107°m) was
added to test the susceptibility of these depolarized po-
tentials to calcium channel blockage.

drugs used and statistics

we used concentrations of  xxxd2344xxx  (10~° and 3 x
10-®m) that approximated therapeutic levels in animal
studies and in man (unpublished data, lilly research
laboratories). moreover, to compare our data with other
published studies on the kinetics of onset and recovery
from block, we used a concentration of  xxxd2344xxx  (3 x
p 6m) that caused approximately a 50% inhibition of

at stimulation rates of 3 hz.  xxxd2344xxx  (1077

tm | is only 10-20% bound to human plasma albumin
and 40% bound to human plasma (lilly research labs,
unpublished data). the name ‘‘ xxxd2344xxx ’’ as used
herein refers to the free base (molecular weight = 308).
the hci salt was used in all studies, and the molar con-
centration reported reflects the molecular weight of the
salt. nifedipine (pfizer) was dissolved in ethanol and di-
luted in tyrode’s solution.

results are generally expressed as mean + se, and
(except as indicated) the significance of the difference
between means was determined by a paired sample ¢ test
comparing the control values and the values obtained
after exposure to drug in the same cell. in analyzing the
membrane response curves, the sigmoidal relationship
between ‘‘h’’? and membrane potential was estimated as
described by bigger and mandel (14). standard linear
regression analysis (17) was used to determine the rate
constant for v,,,, block onset and recovery. all impale-
ments were maintained in the same cell during the control
period and drug exposure. values of p < 0.05 were con-
sidered significant.

a marked inhibition of v,,,, and a shortening of
apd.  xxxd2344xxx  (3 x 10~°m) reduced action
potential amplitude from 126 + 2 to 110 + 4 mv
(n = 10, p < 0.001) and membrane resting potential
from —92 + 4to —86 + 4mv (n = 8, p < 0.05).
the rate of rise of phase 0 decreased from 593 +
104 to 435 + 67 v/s (23 + 6% decrease, p < 0.05)
 xxxd1891xxx -°m (n = 7) and from 627 + 66 to 361 + 53
vis (43 + 4% decrease, p < 0.001) at 3 x 10°°m
(n = 9). the decrease in v,,,, was accompanied by
a decrease in conduction velocity along the purkinje
fiber.  xxxd2344xxx  (3 x 10~°m) decreased conduc-
tion velocity by 42% from 2.4 + 0.5 to 1.4 + 0.2
m/s (p < 0.05, n = 4). the electrophysiological ef-
fects of  xxxd2344xxx  were reversible following 30-
60 min superfusion with drug-free media. inde-
cainide decreased both the apd and cellular erp
(tables 1 and 2). since purkinje fiber erp short-
ened to about the same extent as apd, there was
little change in the erp/apd. in ventricular papil-
lary muscle stimulated at 1 hz (n = 5),  xxxd2344xxx 
(3 x 1076m) also decreased vina, (25 + 4%, p <
0.01). however, apdz), apd,;, amplitude, and
resting potential were unchanged.

in five experiments on purkinje fibers, we studied
the relationship between v,,,, of a premature im-
pulse and the membrane potential from which that
impulse arose. in the presence of  xxxd2344xxx  (3 x
10-®m), the membrane response curve was shifted
down and to the right (fig. 3, top). when, for all
five experiments, vmax was normalized to the de-
crease in vin ax at the basic cycle length of 1,000 ms,
 xxxd2344xxx  » shifted the curve in a hyperpolarizing
direction on the voltage axis by about 5 mv (fig. 3,
bottom). there was also an increase in the slope of
the curve, indicating the shift was most prominent
at more depolarized potentials.

in fig. 4. in control solution, vzqx did not change
markedly over this frequency range. however, in
the presence of  xxxd2344xxx , v,,,, decreased to a
greater degree as the frequency of stimulation in-
creased. for example, at a cycle length of 370 ms
 xxxd2344xxx  decreased v,,,, by 55 + 4% while at
a cycle length of 20,000 ms v,,,, was decreased by
35 + 4% (p < 0.01, ¢ test for 2 means). over phys-
iologically relevant cycle lengths (370-1,000 ms),
however, the inhibition of v,,,, caused by inde-
cainide was relatively constant.

use-dependent kinetics

since trains of impulses at a frequency of 2 hz
or greater caused maximal use-dependent block of
vinaxs (fig. 4), we used 3 hz trains to determine
the kinetics of the onset and recovery from block
in both purkinje fibers and papillary muscle. fig. 5
shows an example of how, in purkinje fibers, the
duration of the inter-train interval influences the
vinax of the initial action potential in a subsequent
train. no significant use-dependent block was noted
in control studies after short or long (150 s) inter-

train intervals. (fig. 5, top). in the presence of in-
decainide (fig. 5, bottom), steady-state vmax at 3
hz was decreased, and no recovery in v,,,, was
even noted after a 3-s inter-train interval (fig. 5,
bottom left). however, after 150 s (fig. 5, bottom
right), both the recovery of the v,,,, of the initial
potential in the train and the exponential onset of
use-dependent block were now evident. the rate
constant for onset of maximal use-dependent block
was 0.060 + 0.007 action potentials ~! (7, = 12 +
1 action potentials) in purkinje fibers (n = 5), and
0.100 + 0.004 action potentials ~'(t,. = 7.0 + 0.3
action potentials) in papillary muscle (n = 4).

the v,,,, of the first action potential elicited at
any inter-train interval [vinaxit)] was normalized to
the v,,,, at an inter-train interval of 300 s [vinaxco)]
and the expression | — [vinaxce/ vinax(oyl (representing
the proportion of unavailable sodium channels) was
plotted against inter-train interval to yield a single
exponential with a recovery half-time for v,,,, of 52
+ 6s (fig. 6). the corresponding value obtained in
papillary muscle was 49 + 6s. tonic block in pur-
kinje fibers (the drug-induced percent inhibition of
vinax of the first potential occurring after a 5 min
inter-train interval) was estimated to be at mosi 8
+ 4%. no tonic block was detected in experiments
using papillary muscle (—9 + 12%).

automaticity

fibers having either normal or depolarized max-
imal diastolic potentials (table 3) showed a reduced
firing rate in the presence of  xxxd2344xxx  (3 x
10-°m), although the effect was modest. moreover,
the amplitude of barium-induced potentials was un-
affected by  xxxd2344xxx , although these potentials
were completely abolished by nifedipine (3 x

10-°m).

sponding values for v, were — 64,4 + 1.7 and —69.7 + 1.0

these electrophysiological properties qualitatively
resemble a wide variety of class i drugs having po-
tent local anesthetic activity (6—8,16). in this re-
gard,  xxxd2344xxx  has about the same degree of local
anesthetic activity on unmyelinated mammalian
nerve tissue as does  xxxd204xxx  (unpublished data).

trace and bottom trace in each panel shows the action po-
tential (top portion clipped) and its corresponding v,,,, re-
spectively. the upper calibration in the lower right refers to
the action potential and the bottom calibration refers to the
derivative trace. in the absence of drug no use-dependent
block was noted even after 150 s rest between trains as the
vinax of the initial potential is similar to remaining potentials
in the train.  xxxd2344xxx  decreased the steady-state v_,,, at 3
hz (62% of control), and only slight recovery of block was
noted after 3 s of rest between trains. after an inter-train
interval of 150 s the first v,,,, elicited has recovered to 84%
of control, and the onset of use-dependent block was clearly
evident. note that the first action potential elicited in a train
arises from more depolarized potentials yielding a smaller
vinax than would be expected for that inter-train interval.
thus, vina, of the initial beat was calculated from the expo-
nential onset of use-dependent block as described in
methods.

with long recovery halftimes generally exhibit a
slow onset of block during repetitive activity and
vice versa. broadly speaking, one can discern two
major subdivisions of class i agents—those that are
kinetically *‘slow’’ and those that are kinetically
‘‘fast.””

 xxxd2344xxx  must be considered as belonging to

the kinetically slow group. in fact,  xxxd2344xxx  pos-
sesses such a long recovery half-time (52 and 49 s
in purkinje fiber and muscle, respectively) in rela-
tion to physiologically meaningful heart rates or
prematurity intervals, that late-coupled beats or
beats elicited at normal rates (1~2 hz) were sup-
pressed to the same degree as very early beats or
those elicited at more rapid rates (>2 hz) (figs. 4
and 5). the recovery from inactivation seems to
correlate reasonably well with molecular weight,
lipid solubility, and degree of ionization; in
general, bulky hydrophilic compounds with high
pk,s tend to have the slowest recovery rates (20).
thus, based on  xxxd2344xxx ’s molecular weight
(308), octanol-water partition coefficient (log p =
3.0) and pk, (10.4), one may calculate a recovery
half-time of about 10 s. the considerably longer
values we found in both muscle and purkinje fibers
tend to support the idea that specific structural or
steric factors may also influence the affinity of local
anesthetics for the sodium channel (21,22). molec-
ular size, however, does seem to be especially im-
portant in governing the kinetics of block onset with
smaller less bulky compounds (molecular weight <
about 280) seeming to ‘‘fit’’ most easily into open-
activated channels (23,24). the relatively slow half-
time for block onset in the presence of  xxxd2344xxx 
(about 2 and 4 s at a drive rate of 3 hz in muscle
and purkinje fibers, respectively) is consistent with
this idea, but factors such as stimulation frequency
and drug concentration are also important deter-
minants of onset block (5,20,24—26).

when studied over sufficiently long, intersti-
mulus intervals and at therapeutically relevant con-
centrations, most class i agents have been shown
to possess little or no resting or tonic block in car-
diac tissues (4,10,20,27,28), and  xxxd2344xxx  is no
exception. the fact that little or no resting block
was detected at normally polarized membrane po-
tentials, suggests that  xxxd2344xxx  has little or no
affinity for resting sodium channels. thus, like

other compounds having little affinity for resting
channels, it is likely that once  xxxd2344xxx  interacts
with open or inactivated channels, a fixed propor-
tion of sodium channels per beat are ‘‘trapped”’ in
the inactivated state, and recovery then depends on
the slow conversion of such channels to the drug-
free resting state (5,18). studies under voltage-con-
trolled conditions will be required to determine
whether the compound has higher affinity for open
or inactive channels (29,30). however, the fact that
the normalized membrane-response curve (fig. 3)
is shifted to more negative potentials (indicating a
greater inhibition of v,,,, at depolarized potentials)
might suggest that the compound possesses a some-
what enhanced affinity for inactivated channels.
thus, it might be anticipated that in ischemic tissue
or in tissues depolarized by high extracellular po-
tassium ion,  xxxd2344xxx  might cause greater
depression of v,,,, and conduction velocity than in
normal tissue.

although the ionic mechanism(s) responsible for
the differential effect of  xxxd2344xxx  on purkinje
fiber and muscle apd is unknown, the shortening
of apd in purkinje fibers could be related to an
increase in outward current (possibly carried by po-
tassium) (31,32) or a decrease in inward current,
e.g., possibly sodium current flowing during the
plateau phase as has been recently described
(33,34). since the plateau of the dog ventricular
muscle action potential tends to be dominated by
the slow inward current carried primarily by cal-
cium ion (31), the lack of effect of  xxxd2344xxx  on
apd in this tissue suggests that  xxxd2344xxx  lacks
slow calcium channel blocking activity. more direct
evidence that this is the case was the failure of in-
decainide to influence the amplitude or firing rate
of action potentials arising from depolarized mem-
brane potentials in the presence of barium ion
(table 3). depolarization and enhanced automa-
ticity induced by barium ion is presumably me-
diated by a decrease in potassium conductance (35)
accompanied by enhanced inward current carried
via slow channel mechanisms (36).

we recognize the problems in extrapolating the
information from electrophysiological studies of in-
decainide obtained in vitro to possible mechanisms
of antiarrhythmic activity in man. nevertheless,
several of our observations may have some rele-
vance to  xxxd2344xxx ’s clinical utility. first, inde-
cainide is a powerful depressant of v,,,, over a wide
range of heart rates and prematurity intervals.
thus, a delay in conduction of both normal sinus
beats and extrasystoles (increased hv interval and
prolonged qrs duration) might be expected at ther-
apeutic doses. early clinical studies have shown
that effective antiarrhythmic doses were accompa-
nied by increases in qrs duration (37). this ac-
tivity might be important in interrupting automatic

j cardiovasc pharmacol, vol. 6, no. 4, 1984

or re-entrant rhythms by causing exit block or by
suppressing conduction within the re-entrant circuit
to the point of total conduction failure, respectively
(38). second, due perhaps to the lack of time-de-
pendent effects on v,,,, of premature impulses elic-
ited during phase 3 as well as the relatively small
shift in membrane-response curve (fig. 3), the erp
and apd were decreased to about the same extent,
and the erp/apd was unchanged (tables 1 and 2).
the net result might be to improve the conduction
of closely coupled beats within the conducting net-
work which otherwise might have been conducted
decrementally. third, although in this study we
were unable to demonstrate any significant effect of
 xxxd2344xxx  on automaticity arising from either
normal or depolarized potentials (table 3), it is pos-
sible that some of the abnormal automatic mecha-
nisms (including triggered automaticity) that arise
in ischemic tissues (38) may be more sensitive to
the drug.

finally, like  xxxd2344xxx , some of the newer, po-
tent class i agents are characterized by a relatively
slow onset of and recovery from block of the so-
dium channel (4,10,39). these substances are often
extraordinarily effective in suppressing sponta-
neous abnormal rhythms in man (40,41). thus, in-
stead of selectively inhibiting early premature beats
or only those elicited at high rates, as would be
expected to occur with kinetically-fast drugs, it may
be at least as desirable to suppress as wide a range
of abnormal rhythms as possible (early and late;
slow and fast) with the kinetically-slow drugs (42).
thus, our results support the idea (43) that a dis-
tinction among class i drugs based on their influ-
ence on sodium channel kinetics may contribute to
a more rational classification scheme for class i
agents as well as allow for a greater understanding
of their clinical actions.
