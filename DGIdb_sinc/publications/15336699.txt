abstract
glucocorticoids have significant effects on endothelium mediated vascular function throughout life. the baboon model has been used
extensively to study cellular responses to glucocorticoids at several stages of the lifespan. endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (enos) is a major
regulator of endothelium dependent arterial vasodilation. we have previously demonstrated that synthetic glucocorticoids down regulate enos
in the baboon placenta. we have now conducted studies to determine whether glucocorticoids would alter enos expression in adult systemic
vascular endothelial cells in this important animal model. we explored this potential mechanism in endothelial cells from femoral arteries
of adult baboons at necropsy and cultured to the fourth passage. endothelial cells were treated with 10–100 nm betamethasone for 24 h at
37 ◦ c.  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) was used as a positive control and medium as negative controls. the role of glucocorticoid
receptor mediation in betamethasone-induced enos changes was investigated with the  xxxg1601xxx  antagonist mifepristone. rna
(real-time quantitative rt-pcr) and protein (elisa) were extracted and measured for enos. expression and subcellular distribution of
 xxxg1601xxx  were detected with fluorescence labeled antibody microscopy. enos mrna and protein in baboon endothelial cells
were downregulated 25% by betamethasone treatment. this effect was attenuated by pre-incubation with mifepristone (p < 0.01). vegf
upregulated enos transcription and translation (p < 0.001), medium did not alter enos expression. we observed that mifepristone and vegf
increased  xxxg1601xxx  cytoplasmic accumulation by fluorescence microscopy. we conclude that betamethasone can downregulate
enos in cultured baboon endothelial cells via the  xxxg1601xxx  pathway.

1. introduction
glucocorticoids (gc) are central in the hypothalamo–
pituitary–adrenocortical axis and have regulatory roles at
all stages of the lifespan in nearly all biological systems
including the vasculature. administration of either natural or
synthetic gc has clear benefits in many clinical situations.

indispensable role in the maturation of the fetal cardiovascular system [1]. glucocorticoid administration to the fetal
sheep accelerates the peripheral vasoconstrictor responses
to endothelin that occur naturally as the fetus matures in
late gestation [2,3]. synthetic glucocorticoids are routinely
administered to accelerate fetal lung maturation in pregnant
women who are at risk of premature delivery between 24
and 34 weeks gestation. preterm birth occurs in 10% of
all live births and is a major cause of neonatal mortality
and morbidity. antenatal synthetic gc therapy reduces the
risk of infant mortality by approximately 30%, the risk of
neonatal respiratory distress syndrome by approximately

220

k. aida et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 91 (2004) 219–224

50%, and the risk of both intracranial hemorrhage and
periventricular leukomalacia by approximately 70% [4].
despite these clear benefits, exposure of the fetus to inappropriately high levels of gc for the current stage of gestation
raises fetal blood pressure and has significant effects on the
fetal peripheral vasculature. fetal blood pressure is elevated
by 30% within 24 h of commencing infusion of synthetic gc
to fetal sheep [5] and fetal nonhuman primates [6] or following maternal administration in the pregnant sheep. elevated
gc exposure in fetal life may also affect the function of blood
vessels in postnatal life [7]. various fetal vascular regulatory
systems have been shown to be affected by gc including
nos [8], endothelin [2] and the renin–angiotensin system
[8,9].
exposure of adult humans to excess gc, either as a
result of external administration or endogenous production during disease states, produces hypertension [10]. in
one recent study, men aged 23–33 years with hypertension showed several indications of increased activity of the
hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenocortical axis such as enhanced
gc sensitivity, cortisol secretion and synthetic gc binding
to leucocytes. thus, understanding the effects of gc on the
vasculature at all life stages is critically important.
whilst some studies demonstrated gc could repress expression of enos [11], other studies suggest that gc could
either downregulate [12] or have no [13,14] effect on enos
expression in the adult vasculature. while the fetal and adult
sheep have been extensively investigated in relation to these
effects of gc there are few studies on nonhuman primates
that provide related data. in the current study we sought to
determine whether gc affect endothelial enos expression in
adult baboon femoral artery endothelial cells cultured in vitro
and to determine whether any effects observed are mediated
via the gc receptor (gr).

2. experimental
2.1. baboon femoral artery endothelial cell culture
primary baboon femoral artery endothelial cells
(bfaecs) were isolated from four baboons (two males
and two females) that were maintained by the southwest
national primate research center at the southwest foundation for biomedical research in san antonio. segments
of femoral arteries approximately 1–3 cm in length were
collected from baboons by sterile methods during necropsy
for research reasons. baboon femoral artery endothelial
cells were harvested no longer than 2 h after the vessels
were excised. the cell isolation procedure was based on
previous reports with modifications [15]. the artery was
placed in a large sterile dish, and the surface was wiped with
2% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (gibco-brl, grand
island, ny) in pbs. the artery was then gently cannulated
at one end with a short blunt needle and flushed with pbs to
remove any blood remaining inside the vessel. it was injected

with 0.1% collagenase before the other end was cannulated.
the closed artery was incubated at 37 ◦ c for 15 min for
digestion. after completion of digestion, the vessel was
massaged gently, flushed with medium, and the released
cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in
medium. the cells were seeded immediately on 1.0% gelatin
coated culture plates. the medium was f-12k supplemented
with 20% fetal calf serum (fcs) (gibco-brl), 75 ␮g/ml
egcs (sigma, st. louis, mo), 50 ␮g/ml heparin, 10 mm
hepes, 2 mm glutamine and antibiotics. confluent cells
were passaged by 0.05% trypsin and versene solution
(gibco-brl), and sub-cultured in a three-fold dilution,
i.e. 1:3 split sub-culture. for the current study, we only used
up to four passages during culture. the endothelial cells
were treated with betamethasone (bm) (10, 50 and 100 nm
in 70% ethanol and 20 ␮l bm solution was added to 2 ml
culture medium) for 24 h at 37 ◦ c. vascular endothelial
growth factor (vegf) was applied as a positive control, and
0.7% ethanol (diluent of bm) or culture medium only was
used as a negative control. to investigate the role of gr in
bm-induced enos changes, the gr antagonist mifepristone
(ru486, sigma) in doses of 1, 100 and 1000 nm was added
30 min before betamethasone treatment. all experiments
were conducted in triplicate in two separate assays (n = 6).
the study was approved by institutional animal care and
use committee (iacuc) of the southwest foundation for
biomedical research.
2.2. enos mrna quantitation by real time (rt)-pcr
at the end of experiment, total rna (50 ng), extracted
with trizol (invitrogen), was reverse transcribed in a 100 ␮l
reaction containing high-capacity cdna archive kit (applied biosystems cat. no. 4322171), followed by rt-pcr
using human enos specific primers (applied biosystems
assay id; hs00167166 ml) which were developed for use
with taqman universal pcr master mix (applied biosystems cat. no. 4304437) and target cdna. we used a human
␤-actin specific primer as an endogenous control. a fluorescent probe, which contained a fam reporter molecule attached to the 5 end and a non fluorescent quencher linked
at the 3 end were used. for each reaction the amount of fluorescence was detected as the function of the quantity of a
reporter dye (fam) that was released. for the relative quantification of gene expression, the comparative threshold cycle
(ct) method was employed as described in user bulletin 2 for
abi prism® 7700 sequence detection systems. ct shows
the pcr cycle at which an increase in reporter fluorescence
above a background signal can first be detected (10 times the
standard deviation of the baseline). first, endogenous control
ct values were subtracted from the gene of interest ct values
to derive a ct value. the relative expression of the gene
of interest was then evaluated using the expression 2-ct,
where the value for ct was obtained by subtracting the
ct of the calibrator from each ct, using the mean of the
negative control as the calibrator. all samples were assayed

in separate tubes in one run together with the endogenous
control.
2.3. enos protein quantiﬁcation by elisa
cells were rinsed three times with cold pbs before being
lysed with osmotic lysis buffer (10 mm tris, ph 7.4, 9.3%
sds, 5 mm mgcl2 , 50 ␮g/ml rnase, 50 ␮g/ml dnase) for
30 min on ice. the total soluble protein concentration in the
supernatant was determined by the bradford method (biorad, cat. no. 500-0006). the extracted proteins were diluted to the same concentration for all samples in the elisa
procedures. we used an enos elisa kit (r&d systems,
cat. no. den00). this assay employs the quantitative enzyme immunoassay technique in which a monoclonal antibody specific for human enos has been pre-coated onto
a microplate. we have used this method to measure enos
protein in the baboon arterial wall [16]. standards and samples were pipetted into the wells and any enos present was
bound by the immobilized antibody. after washing away any

221

unbound substances, an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody
specific for human enos was added to the wells. following
a wash to remove any unbound antibody-enzyme reagent,
a substrate solution was added to the wells and color developed in proportion to the amount of enos bound in the
initial step. the color development was stopped after 10 min
and the intensity of the color was measured. the enos concentration of each sample was calculated from a standard
curve.
2.4. immunoﬂuorescence identiﬁcation of intracellular
gr distribution
to explore the intracellular distribution of gr under different treatments, 200 ␮l of endothelial cell suspension was
seeded on lab-tek culture chambers (nunc, ny) coated with
1.0% gelatin before they were treated with various conditions described above. at the end of 24 h of treatment, cells
were fixed in 2% formalin in pbs at room temperature for
20 min. after they were air-dried, cells were blocked with

3. results
3.1. effects of betamethasone on enos expression
there was a dose-dependent decline in enos expression
with increasing doses of bm (fig. 1, p < 0.01). this decrease
was much more dramatic in enos mrna (fig. 1a, from 1.24
± 0.11 to 0.67 ± 0.03, representing a 46% reduction, p <
0.01) than in protein levels (fig. 1b, from 52.7 ± 1.7 to 41.7
± 3.5 pg/␮g total proteins, representing a 21% reduction, p
< 0.01). as a positive control, 10 ng/ml vegf significantly
increased enos protein (38% increase) and mrna (twofold increase) levels, whereas the vehicle ethanol at the final
concentration of 0.7% had no effect on enos protein and
mrna levels (table 1).
3.2. role of gr in bm-induced enos depression
in order to investigate the mechanisms of bm-induced
enos depression, we pre-incubated the baboon endothelial
cells with the gr antagonist mifepristone (ru486). whilst
ru486 had no effect by itself on enos expression, it did
attenuate the inhibiting effect of bm on enos (table 1,
p < 0.01). this effect appeared to be at the transcriptional
level since the same degree of restoration of expression was
also observed at enos mrna level. we further examined
the expression and distribution of gr receptors. as shown
in fig. 2, there was a low level of gr expression in nuclei as well as cytoplasm of control cells. vegf treatment
appeared to increase gr expression as shown by increased
levels in both nuclei and cytoplasm in a diffuse form. treatment with bm appeared to have little effect on gr expression, but ru486 caused more gr diffuse into the cytoplasm.
at the high ru486 concentration (100 nm), the cytoplasmic gr clustered around the perinuclear region. however,
the nuclear content of gr did not appear to change, especially when compared with the fluorescence intensity of gr
specific staining in the nuclei of vegf treated endothelial
cells. however, it should be noted that these conclusions
are not quantitatively based but mainly derived from visual
observations.

4. discussion
as discussed in the introduction both the sheep and the baboon have been used extensively to follow the effects of gc
on the vasculature at different stages of life. we have shown
that exposure of the fetal sheep and baboon to synthetic glucocorticoids alters endothelium dependent responses of small
peripheral vessels [2,17]. with the wide spread use of gc in
various clinical conditions, it is important to understand the
potential side effects that are caused by gc administration at
all stages of development and postnatal life. results of our
previous study with baboon fetal placental vessels demonstrated a decreased enos expression and enzyme activity

223

[18,19]. this decrease in placental vascular endothelial enos
occurs in the presence of increased fetal blood pressure, [6] a
situation that should increase enos as a response to increased
sheer stress on the vascular endothelium.
in the present study using adult baboon femoral artery
endothelial cells, we have shown the same depressive effect
on enos mrna and protein levels. this effect is bm dosedependent. similar to our previous in vivo data, [18] the decrease of mrna levels was much more dramatic than of protein levels. this observation is consistent with the mechanism
of action being reduced transcription rather than translation.
our current results suggest that this inhibiting effect may
be mediated through the gr receptor pathway since we
have further shown that the effect on enos expression is
largely attenuated when endothelial cells are preconditioned
by ru486. gr is a nuclear receptor which mediates the genomic responses to the hormones [20]. when cells are exposed to steroid hormones, such as bm, gr binds with bm
and translocates to nucleus to fulfill its transcriptional function [21]. short-term incubation with bm (5 h) may cause a
decrease in gr level [22]. however, after prolonged incubation (24 h), this effect may be diminished [21]. this result is
consistent with our observation of little effect on gr expression 24 h after bm treatment.
our experiments have further shown that cells treated with
gr inhibitor ru486 in presence of 100 nm bm had increased
cytoplasmic gr concentrations (fig. 2). ru486 is a dual antagonist with both antiprogesterone and antiglucocorticosteriod function. its antiglucocorticosteriod effect is likely to be
mediated through the formation of a heterooligomeric complex with gr, which impedes or slows down the formation of
the activated receptor form observed after binding an agonist
[20]. therefore, more ru486–gr complexes are present in
cytoplasm, and gr function is inhibited. as shown in fig. 2,
at a high concentration of ru486, clustered accumulation of
gr was observed in the perinuclear location as compared
to cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution at lower ru486 concentrations. this may be inconsistent with the observation by
schaaf and cidlowski in which they observed both bm and
ru486 caused nucleus translocation of gr [23]. whilst it
is still under investigation, the cell type specificity and cotreatment of bm and ru486 could be the reason for the
cytoplasmic sequestration in our experiment. we also note
the significant nuclear gr staining in our control experiment, which could be due to the presence of glucocorticoids
(<15.6 nm) in fetal calf serum used in our culture medium
[24].
whilst it is known that glucocorticoids reduce vegf expression, [22,25–28] we, for the first time, show that vegf
may upregulate gr expression, especially nuclear gr concentrations (fig. 2). at the same time, vegf, as a positive
control, has also upregulated enos expression. it is not clear,
however, whether the upregulated gr expression by vegf
is associated with high or low gr function. if the function
of gr is upregulated by vegf, it would then be difficult to
reconcile the inhibiting effect by gr agonist, such as bm,

224

k. aida et al. / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 91 (2004) 219–224

on enos expression as observed by us and wallerath et al.
[12]. it is tempting to propose that vegf may act similarly
as ru486. although the gr levels may appear to be high
when exposed to vegf, the gr function may be inhibited.
however, more quantitative investigations will be needed in
order to confirm the findings.
in summary, we confirm that bm downregulated enos,
as observed in vivo in pregnant baboons. thus, gc appear
to have similar effects on the vascular endothelium in both
fetal and adult life. this downregulation is mediated via the
gr pathway as shown by the attenuating effect of the ru486
treatment. our findings of increased gr accumulation when
cells were treated by vegf, in a similar pattern to those
treated by ru486, is intriguing and deserves more investigation.
