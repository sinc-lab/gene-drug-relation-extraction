affinities of some common opioid analgesics towards four binding sites
in mouse brain

summary. the selectivities of morphine, codeine,/-metha-,
done and  xxxd3031xxx , towards the binding sites in
mouse brain membranes labelled by 3h- xxxd1888xxx 
(dhm), ~h-ethylketocyclazocine (ekc) and 3h-d-ala 2
-leus-enkephalin (dale), were investigated. of the four
binding sites identified, three correspond to mu-, kappaand delta-opioid binding sites or receptors, respectively.
the fourth site has a high capacity and binds ekc with a
high affinity, dhm with a very low affinity and does not
bind dale. in displacement studies, the relative affinities
of morphine and methadone were quite similar towards
the tree sites with highest affinity (mu >> kappa >> delta).
codeine and  xxxd3031xxx  were mu-selective but did
not differentiate between kappa- and delta-sites. at high
concentrations /-methadone (kd=6.7 ~tm), and  xxxd3031xxx  (kd = 40 fm) bound to the fourth site, while
morphine, codeine and naloxone were practically inactive.
the binding selectivities of these drugs were quite different
from those of metkephamid and u-50, 488 h, substances
that are thought to exert their antinociceptive effects
through delta- and kappa-receptors, respectively. it was
concluded that while  xxxd3031xxx  and codeine m a y
partly act through other receptors than morphine, this is
probably not the case for/-methadone.

introduction

there is growing evidence that opioid analgesics exert their
effects through multiple receptor populations. while portoghese (1965), on the basis of structure-activity data, concluded that different analgesics could interact with the
same receptor(s) in dissimilar modes, the existence of more
than one opioid receptor was proposed by martin (1967).
he distinguished three opioid receptors named mu, kappa
and sigma, where both mu and kappa mediate opioid i.e.
naloxone-reversible analgesia (martin et al. 1976). in 1977,
lord et al. demonstrated a novel opioid receptor in vitro,
termed delta-receptor, and there is evidence that analgesic

effects in vivo may be mediated by this receptor as well
(frederickson et al. 1981). radio-ligand techniques have
shown binding sites that presumably correspond to these
receptors (lord et al. 1977; kosterlitz and paterson 1980;
zukin and zukin 1981).
while the concept of multiple receptors for analgesic
has been used to design new and more selective systemically active compounds, the receptor selectivity of older,
commonly used analgesics has not been much studied. previous in vivo studies from this laboratory has indicated that
morphine,/-methadone, codeine and  xxxd3031xxx  differ in mechanism of action in the mouse hot-plate test.
antinociception induced by  xxxd3031xxx  is less susceptible to naloxone reversal than morphine-induced (neil
and terenius 1981). also, an asymmetry in cross-tolerance
between /-methadone and morphine has been found:
while morphine-pretreated mice were tolerant to morphine only, /-methadone-pretreated mice were tolerant to
/-methadone, morphine, codeine and  xxxd3031xxx , and
more so to morphine than to methadone itself (neff 1982).
it was suggested that the differences in actions among these
drugs could be due differnces in their selectivity towards
opioid receptor populations.
with iterative computer analysis (munson and rodbard 1980) of the binding of tritiated  xxxd1888xxx 
(dhm), d-ala2-leus-enkephalin (dale) and ethylketocyclazocine (ekc) to mouse brain membranes, it was
possible to discriminate four different opioid binding sites
(neil, submitted): three of the sites probably correspond
to the my-, kappa- and delta-receptors, as defined by kosterlitz and co-workers (lord et al. 1977; kosterlitz et al.
'1981), respectively. the fourth site showed no affinity for
naloxone,  xxxd2070xxx  or dale, but bound skf 10,047 with
high affinity. however, it bound ekc with still higher affinity, and thus differed from sigma-receptors as defined by
zukin and zukin (1981). since the biological significance
of this site is not clear it is simply called site 4, throughout
this communication.
in this paper, the same ligand binding analysis was
used to investigate the relative selectivities of the opioid
analgesic previously studied, to find out to what extent the
differences in action mechanisms observed in vivo, could
be related to corresponding differences in receptor selectivities in vitro. for comparison, the systemically active
analgesics metkephamid and u-50, 488 h reported to act
via delta- (frederickson et al. 1981) and kappa-receptors
(lahti et al. 1982), respectively, were included in the study.

material and methods

drugs used. the following drugs were used as unlabelled
displacing ligands: morphine hydrochloride and codeine
phosphate (aco, stockholm, sweden),  xxxd1888xxx 
base (dhm) prepared from morphine, (d-ala2-leu s)
-enkephalin (dale) (synthesized by dr. u. ragnarsson,
dept. of biochemistry, university of uppsala), ethylketocyclazocine methanesulfonate (ekc) (sterling-winthrop, rensselaer, ny, usa), /-methadone hydrochloride
and metkephamid (eli lilly co., indianapolis, in, usa),
d- xxxd3031xxx  (astra ab, s6dert~ilje,
sweden), naloxone (endo laboratories, garden city, ny,
usa), u-50, 488 h ((trans-(+)-3,4-dichlor-n-methyl-n-(2(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl)-benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate, the upjohn company, kalamazoo, mi, usa).

tritiated ligands. these were, (3h)dhm (radiochemical
centre, amersham, england) spec. act. 75 ci/mmol, (3h)dale (radiochemical centre, customs labelling) spec.
act. 25 ci/mmol, (3h)ekc (nen, boston, ma, usa) spec.
act. 15 ci/mmol. the tritiated ligands were purified when
needed, by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) on a c-18 column, eluted by a water:
methanol gradient.
binding assay. mouse brain membranes were prepared
essentially according to gray and whittaker (1962) as
modified by terenius (1974): male nmri mice (anticimex, solna, sweden) were decapitated and the whole
brain minus cerebellum was homogenized in 10 volumes of
0.32 m sucrose in an aldridge homogenizer. the homogehate was centrifuged for 10 rain  xxxd1891xxx ,000 x gmax, the supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 17,000 x gmax, and the
pellet osmotically shocked by 3 volumes of ice-cold distilled water and centrifuged 20 min at 12,000 x gmax. the
supernatant was carefully decanted, diluted with a isotonic
balanced
hepes
(n-2-hydroxyethyl-piperazine-n'2-ethanesulfonic acid, sigma, st louis, mo usa) buffer
(124 mmol/1  xxxg2020xxx , 5 mmol/1 kc1, 1.2 retool/1 kh2po4,
0.75 mmol/1 cac12, 1.3 retool/1  xxxd2534xxx  and 26 mmol/1
hepes, ph 7.4), and centrifuged 30 rain at 40,000 x gmax.
this final pellet was resuspended in hepes buffer, diluted
to 4 volumes/initial wet weight and stored in aliquots at
- 8 0 ~ until used. 0.2 ml of this membrane preparation,
0.2ml of radioligand solution in hepes buffer, and
0.025 ml of distilled water only or with cold ligand in logarithmic dilution, was mixed in centrifuge tubes, incubated
at 25 ~ for 25 rain, and centrifuged in a beckman type b
microfuge (beckman inc, palo alto, ca, usa) 9,000 x gmax
for 5 rain. the tubes were then put tips inwards into holes
of a rotating wheel driven by a motor whereby the supernatant was thrown out into a bucket. the tips of the tubes
containing the membrane pellet were cut off and digested
in tissue solubilizer (soluene | 350, packard, la grange,
il, usa), and neutralized with hci before addition of
scintillation cocktail. samples were counted in a scintillation counter and the counting efficiency calculated by
channels ratio standardisation.
the saturable binding of (3h)dhm, (3h)dale and
(ah)ekc was determined in the concentration range of
0.01-1 nm by adding tritiated ligand only and a higher
concentrations by the addition of increasing doses of cold
ligand to 1 nm of tritiated. the affinities of the other li-

gands towards these sites were determined indirectly by
displacing 0.5-1 nm solutions of the tritiated ligand with
cold ligands in logarithmic dilutions. samples were run in
duplicates. in the displacement assays, non-displaceable
binding was monitored by including tubes with excess
(10 .5 mol/1 for dhm, or 10-6 tool/1 for dale and ekc)
cold ligand corresponding to the labelled. non-displaceable binding was calculated and subtracted by the computer program. in the case full displacement of labelled ligand
could not be obtained within the concentration range used,
the non-displaceable binding obtained with excess cold ligand had to be used to set non-specific binding for computing purposes.

data analysis. the ligand binding curves were fitted by
nonlinear weighted least-squares regression using the "ligand" program by munson and rodbard (1980) run on a
nord-10 16-bit minicomputer. this was done in steps,
where results from previous steps were used as initial estimates in the following ones. first, binding parameters of
the sites that could be measured by the labelled ligands
dhm, dale and ekc alone in the mouse brain membrane preparation used were determined. thereafter, the
data sets obtained with two ligands either labelled or used
as cold displacers against each other were fitted simultaneously. by this combination of information from several
binding curves, a more accurate and precise estimate of the
parameters is obtained, (for a full discussion of this approach see munson and rodbard 1980). finally, the binding parameters for the three ligands in labelled form, and
as cold displacers against each of the other were determined. these sets were fitted to successively more complex
models involving increasing numbers of sites, until no improvement in the goodness-of-fit was obtained, or systematic deviations in the signs of the residuals could be detected, as determined by the f-test and the runs test,
respectively, incorporated in the program.
this final model was then used to characterize the
binding properties of the other ligands towards the binding
sites detected. the data obtained for each of the other ligands used as competitors against the three tritiated ligands, were simultaneously fitted to the model and their
affinities to the different sites determined.
results

the four site model
the estimated parameters of the final model are presented
in table 1. when the observed data for all pairwise combinations of dhm, dadl and ekc binding/displacement
curves were fitted simultaneously, analysis of variance
showed a considerable better fit to a four- than a three-site
model (f=36.5; dr=5,112; p < 0.01). it can be noted that
the binding capacities of the three first sites, together
amounted to less than the fourth one. all three prototype
ligands used showed a high affinity to mu-sites. while
dhm showed one and two orders of magnitude less affinity towards kappa- and delta-sites, respectively, ekc
bound with the same affinity to my- and kappa-sites and
dale showed little differentiation between delta- and mysites. the fourth site was labelled by ekc, with a kd 20 times that for mu- and delta-sites. dhm showed very low affinity towards this site, and dale did not seem to bind at
all.

site selectivity of opioid drugs
the affinities of the opioid drugs towards the four binding
sites of the model are summarized in table 2. the first
group of opioids, morphine, /-methadone, codeine and
 xxxd3031xxx , were all mu-selective (fig. 1 a - c ) and
had relative affinities to kappa-sites that were a few percent of those towards mu-sites. codeine and  xxxd3031xxx  did not differentiate much between kappa- and
delta-sites. morphine showed almost zero affinity to site 4
relative the mu-site (kd-ratio > 104), while /-methadone
and codeine showed one and  xxxd3031xxx  two orders
of magnitude higher relative affinity. methadone fully displaced all 3h-ekc-binding within the concentration-range
used, and  xxxd3031xxx  seemed to have a higher absolute affinity than morphine towards site 4 (fig. 1 c).
naloxone did not bind to site 4. the curve for naloxone
displacement of (3h)ekc leveled off in the middle of the
concentration range (fig. 1 c). the relative affinities of
naloxone to kappa- and delta sites, were one half and one
seventeenth, respectively, of that to mu-sites.
the displacement curves for the two other agonists,
metkephamid and u-50,488h, and morphine (reproduced
from fig. 1 for comparison), are shown in fig. 2 a - c . metkephamid showed approximately seven times higher affin-

ity towards mu- than delta-receptors, but little binding to
kappa-sites and practically no affinity towards site 4.
u-50,488h, on the other hand was the most kappa- selective ligand tested (fig. 2 c). it bound to kappa-sites with
more than 90-fold higher affinity than to mu-sites, and
even towards site 4 it was more active than towards musites. the affinity of this compound for delta-sites was comparatively very minor.
discussion

the commonly used opioid analgesics morphine, l-methadone, codeine and  xxxd3031xxx , did not differ much in
their binding-site selectivity. they all bound preferentially
to mu-sites, and at higher concentrations they also bound
to kappa-sites to the same relative extent. in the case of
morphine this is in accordance with the original in vivo
classification of opioid receptors, where martin et al. (1976)
stated that morphine had medium affinty also to kappa-receptors. the affinities to delta-sites were low but more variable, with  xxxd3031xxx  showing the highest, codeine
intermediate, and morphine and /-methadone the lowest
relative affinity as compared to the mu-sites. it has previously been reported from this laboratory that d-propoxy-

cross-tolerance studies mentioned above (neil 1982). the
data partly agree with magnan et al. (1982) who found
/-methadone to be less mu-/delta-binding selective by
binding analysis in the guinea-pig brain, but to have a
guinea-pig ileum/mouse vas deferens activity ratio like
other typical my-agonists.
binding site 4 showed higher binding capacity than the
others, and naloxone did not bind to this site. whether or
not it mediates any effects in vivo is not kown, but due to
these properties it might play a role. binding to secondary
silent receptor sites have been postulated in order to explain the slow wash-out of some opioids in the guinea-pig
ileum (kosterlitz et al. 1972), and naloxone-insensitive ef-

fects of some opioids have been reported (teal and holzman 1980; vaupel 1983). when compared to the other
drugs in this study (except u-50,488h),  xxxd3031xxx 
had high relative affinity for site 4, and  xxxd3031xxx  is
know to be psychotomimetic in high doses (fraser and isbell 1960; tennant 1973), an effect generally ascribed to
sigma-opiate receptors which are insensitive to naloxone
(martin et al. 1976). a (~h)methadone binding site in rabbit brain tissue that cannot be displaced by naloxone or
morphine has been reported previously (ciafolo 1979), and
may correspond to the natoxone-insensitive site 4 observed
here.
the extent the small differences in relative selectivity
found, could be of any significance for the in vivo pharmacology of common analgesics, might possibly be estimated from the observed properties of the two newer
analgesics metkephamid and u-50,488h included in the
study for comparative purposes. both metkephamid and
u-50,488h differed from prototype mu-analgesics in their
binding selectivities, and although they are systemically active analgesics, they differ in principal sites of action, crosstolerance patterns and in reversibility by the antagonist
naloxone. while morphine, which is supposed to act via
mu-receptors, has mainly supraspinal action when administered systemically (carroll and lim 1960), u-50,488h
acts predominantly at the spinal level when given systemically to mice (piercey et al. 1982). furthermore it shows no
crosstolerance to morphine, and the pa2 for naloxone
towards its analgesic effect is one unit lower than towards
morphine (lahti et al. 1982). metkephamid maintain a
higher affinity to mu- than delta-sites. its antinociceptive
effect is partly decreased in morphine-tolerant mice (hynes
and frederickson 1982), which indicates an action through
mu-receptors, but its effect is less easily reversed by naloxone (yaksh 1983), suggesting involvement of delta-receptors. the potency of metkephamid is relatively less decreased in spinalized mice than that of morphine (ling and
pasternak 1983), indicating a more spinal site of action.
thus, in order to act mainly through kappa-receptors in
vivo as u-50,488h does, an eight-fold in vitro binding
selectivity is sufficient, but from the present data it is not
possible to determine the limit for kappa- versus mu-selectivity where mu-mediated effects would dominate. metkephamid however, although mu-selective in its binding,
probably acts through both mu- and delta-mediated mechanisms. this indicates that relatively lower affinity to deltathan my-sites does not rule out an action through deltasites, and that other factors than site-selectivity in vitro
could play a large role in the pharmacological profile of
analgesics.
since both  xxxd3031xxx  and codeine differed somewhat from the more potent analgesics in their binding profile, it might be noted that morphine-tolerant mice are less
tolerant to codeine and  xxxd3031xxx  than to morphine
(neil 1982), and the antinociceptive effects of these analgesics are less easily reversed by nalorphine and naloxone
respectively, than those of morphine (adler 1963); neil
and terenius 1981). there is also evidence that  xxxd3031xxx  is relatively more spinal in its action than morphine in the rat (neil and terenius 1982). thus, the possibility that codeine and  xxxd3031xxx  exert some of their
analgesics effects through other receptors than morphine
should be considered. with more selective kappa- and
delta-antagonists, it should be possible to test the relative

contribution of kappa- and delta-receptors to their overall
effects.
the previous finding of an assymmetry in cross-tolerance between morphine and/-methadone (neil 1982) can
not be explained in terms of differences in gross selectivity
to different opioid binding sites. it might be due to more
subtle differences, as by interaction with different isoreceptors as proposed by schulz and wt~ster (1981), or differences in efficacies between morphine and/-methadone.
according to stephenson (1956), it is difficult to determine
the contributions of efficacy and affinity to the stimulus of
a full agonist. since morphine tolerance might be due to a
decrease in receptor reserve, as shown in the ilea of morphine-tolerant guinea-pigs (chavkin and goldstein 1982),
one possibility is that while several drugs act als full opioid
agonists in the opiate-naive state, they may have widely
different efficacies. thus, depending on the limits of the receptor reserve for the drugs in question and the actual testsystem, the differences in efficacies may show up in the
tolerant state.
to conclude: morphine, /-methadone, codeine and
 xxxd3031xxx  did not differ in their relative selectivities
to mu- and kappa-binding sites, but some difference in
their seleetivities for delta-binding sites was found. there is
a possibility that  xxxd3031xxx  and codeine partly act
through other receptors than morphine./-methadone however, shows identical selectivities towards receptors that
mediate opioid antinociception as morphine, and a previously observed lack of full cross-tolerance between these
drugs can therfore not be explained in terms of binding site
selectivity, but might be due to other properties such as differences in spare receptors.
