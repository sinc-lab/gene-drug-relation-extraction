abstract
the causal prophylactic activity of five tricyclic anti-histaminic agents (histamine h1-receptor antagonists)  xxxd1785xxx , ketotifen, loratadine,  xxxd255xxx  and terfenadine was evaluated in an experimental murine malaria model. sporozoite induced infections with
plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis (n-67), a strain innately resistant to choloroquine, were
employed for the efficacy test and pyrimethamine and primaquine were used as standard
reference drugs. treatment with  xxxd1785xxx  or ketotifen at 5 mg/kg and terfenadine at
50 mg/kg, orally for 3 days ( − 1, 0, +1) completely prevented the establishment of patent
infection in mice inoculated with 1 ×105 sporozoites on day 0. partial activity was recorded
with lower doses of the above agents as well as with  xxxd255xxx  and loratadine  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg
as indicated by marginal delay in the development of patent infection after sporozoite
challenge. none of these agents showed blood schizontocidal activity at doses found effective
in the causal prophylactic test, though initial supression of parasitaemia was observed with
 xxxd1785xxx  and ketotifen at higher doses. this study is the first report on efficacy of
antihistaminic agents for growth inhibition of pre-erythrocytic stages of any malaria parasite.

1. introduction
the continued spread of drug resistant plasmodium falciparum malaria and the
appearance of chloroquine resistance in p. 6i6ax malaria underlines the need to
search novel antimalarial agents for treatment or prophylaxis against malaria. with
an estimated 300 – 500 million clinical cases suffering from malaria annually and an
additional tens of millions of people from non-malarious zones travelling to the
endemic countries, chemoprophylactic intervention of parasite development by
killing the pre-erythrocytic stages appears to be the most feasible as well as
efficacious medical approach to check the malaria menace. the declining efficacy of
hitherto used prophylactic agents like chloroquine and other blood schizontocides,
has extremely limited the choice of prophylactic drugs for clinical application.
primaquine, a drug of choice for radical cure was demonstrated to possess true
causal prophylactic activity against p. falciparum in limited clinical studies (powell
and brewer, 1967) but the inherent toxicity limited its wider application and few
new leads have emerged for potential development as prophylactic agents. in a
search for new causal prophylactic agents, a few tricyclic compounds were evaluated, which are in clinical use as antihistaminic drugs (h1-receptor antagonists), for
their protective efficacy against sporozoite induced p. yoelii nigeriensis (n-67)
infection, a murine malaria parasite innately resistant to chloroquine. the antihistaminic drugs selected for the study were  xxxd1785xxx , ketotifen,  xxxd255xxx ,
loratadine and terfenadine.  xxxd1785xxx  and ketotifen have been documented to
possess low level of blood schizontocidal activity against p. falciparum in vitro
(zhou et al., 1988), p. berghei in mice (peters et al., 1990) and p. cynomolgi in the
monkey (huang et al., 1987). in addition,  xxxd1785xxx , ketotifen and  xxxd255xxx 
have been shown to cause a marked reversal of chloroquine resistance against p.
falciparum in vitro and p. yoelii in mice (peters et al., 1990). the causal prophylactic activity of these agents in a rodent malaria model is documented in this report.

2. materials and methods

2.1. parasite
the gametocyte producing strain of p. yoelii nigeriensis (n-67) maintained in the
laboratory bred swiss mice by syringe passage of infected blood or by cyclic
transmission through anopheles stephensi mosquitoes has been used for the study.

2.2. host
random bred swiss mice (209 2 g) of either sex were procured from the
institute’s animal facility for experimental studies. the animals were maintained on
a commercial pellet diet and water ad libitum under standard housing conditions.

2.3. animal inoculation
sporozoites of p. yoelii nigeriensis (n-67) were harvested from infected anopheles
stephensi mosquitoes fed on gametocyte carrying golden hamster and maintained
for 10 – 12 days in insectorium under controlled conditions of temperature (279
2°c) and relative humidity (70 – 80%) as detailed elswhere (singh et al., 1995). at
the time of inoculation of sporozoites, aseptically separated mosquito thoraces were
lightly homogenized in a glass grinder and diluted with chilled normal saline
containing 25% serum. each mouse was inoculated intravenously in the tail vein
with approximately 1× 105 sporozoites suspended in 0.20 ml volume on day 0
(singh et al., 1995).

2.4. causal prophylactic acti6ity
for the causal prophylactic activity, treatment with test compounds was administered orally to groups of mice at various dose levels for 3 consecutive days (− 1, 0,
+ 1). primaquine and pyrimethamine have been used as the reference drugs.
giemsa stained blood smears from experimental animals were prepared from day 3
onwards up to day 28 to record the occurrence of patency. mice which remained
negative till day 28 were recorded as cured.

2.5. blood schizontocidal acti6ity
the blood schizontocidal profile of the test agents was evaluated after a 4 dose
administration (day 0 – 3) to mice inoculated with 1× 106 parasitized erythrocytes
on day 0.

2.6. drugs
samples of  xxxd1785xxx  (alvaetra lab., india), ketotifen (sun pharma, india),
 xxxd255xxx  (fulford, india), loratadine (cadila health care, india) and terfenadine
(cipla, india) were obtained commercially. the test agents were dissolved in water
and administered orally in 1-ml volumes. pure samples of primaquine and
pyrimethamine were obtained from wrair, washington dc.

3. results and discussion
the data on the causal prophylactic tests with five antihistaminic agents and the
reference drugs are summarized in table 1. the results show that  xxxd1785xxx  5
mg/kg, ketotifen 5 mg/kg and terfenadine 50 mg/kg showed 100% prophylactic
activity as none of the mice under these regimens developed patent infection.
efficacy tests with lower doses showed that 2 out of 10 mice treated with
 xxxd1785xxx  at 2.5 mg/kg were cured and the remaining mice became patent
between day 5 – 7. ketotifen exhibited 50% protection at 2.5 mg/kg and patency in

another 5 mice was delayed to between 7 and 10 days. the pre-patent period was
also extended in mice treated with a 1.25 mg/kg dose of the above two agents as
also in groups treated with terfenadine at 25 and 12.5 mg/kg dose levels.  xxxd255xxx 
and loratadine were not curative up to 50 mg/kg dose tested, however, the
pre-patent period was extended over control values. mice treated with primaquine
at 32 mg/kg and pyrimethamine at 0.1 mg/kg were cured while all the vehicle
control mice became patent between day 3–5.
in order to rule out the residual effect of these drugs against emerging exo-erythrocytic merozoites and intra-erythrocytic stages, groups of mice were administered identical regimens of  xxxd1785xxx  (5 mg/kg), ketotifen (5 mg/kg) and
terfenadine (50 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days and animals were challenged with

1× 105 blood stage parasites, 24 h after the last dose to coincide with the time of
maturation and rupture of intrahepatic schizonts. no significant difference in the
course of parasitaemia in drug treated and control animals showed that antihistaminic agents did not exert residual effect. in addition, the blood schizontocidal
action of ketotifen,  xxxd1785xxx  and terfenadine was also evaluated after a
standard four-dose regimen and results are summarized in table 2. mice treated
with terfenadine at 50 mg/kg dose developed parasitaemia similar to the untreated
control while ketotifen and  xxxd1785xxx  also did not show any activity at doses
found effective in causal prophylactic test. tests at higher doses with ketotifen and
 xxxd1785xxx  produced dose – dependent supression of parasitaemia as compared
to the control, though none of the mice were cured.
the low level of inherent blood schizontocidal activity of antihistaminic agents as
well as their chloroquine resistance modulation capacity has been documented
earlier (peters et al., 1990). this report adds to their hitherto known antimalarial
spectrum. however, the mode of action for any of these activities is entirely
unknown. the study also adds tricyclic antihistaminic h1-receptor antagonists to
the limited chemical classes known to exhibit causal prophylactic activity against
rodent malaria (davidson et al., 1981). this new lead is intended to boost the
efforts to find new prophylactic agents for prevention against drug resistant strains
and also to stimulate sar studies to delineate antihistaminic and antimalarial
activities for developing a safer agent for mass chemoprophylaxis.
