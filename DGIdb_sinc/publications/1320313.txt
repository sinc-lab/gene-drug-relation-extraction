the effect of serum tsh on rat  xxxg2320xxx  mrna levels was studied in order to investigate the
regulation of  xxxg2320xxx  gene expression in vivo. a nearly full-length rat  xxxg2320xxx 
cdna clone was isolated from a bacteriophage cdna library synthesized using  xxxd81xxx + rna isolated
from the thyroids of  xxxd3036xxx -treated rats. cdna probes derived from this clone were used to
study rat  xxxg2320xxx  mrna levels in response to the level of serum tsh. two major rat thyroid
peroxidase mrna bands were detected on northern blots of total cellular rna (at 3.2 kb and at 3.7kb).
injection of thyroxine, which lowered the levels of serum tsh, also lowered the steady-state levels of
both rat  xxxg2320xxx  mrnas, whereas treatment with  xxxd2594xxx , which increased serum
tsh, increased both rat  xxxg2320xxx  mrna levels. in hypophysectomized rats 10 days
postoperative, very low levels of  xxxg2320xxx  mrna were observed. injection of bovine tsh
(1 iu/day) increased rat  xxxg2320xxx  mrna expression, preferentially in the 3.2 kb band. these
results clearly demonstrate that tsh regulates rat  xxxg2320xxx  mrna levels in vivo.

 xxxg2320xxx  (tpo) catalyzes the iodination and
oxidative coupling of tyrosines in thyroglobulin to yield
protein bound thyroid hormone. in humans, the pres¬
ence of serum autoantibodies to  xxxg2320xxx  is
diagnostic for autoimmune thyroid diseases, especially
hashimoto's thyroiditis (1-5).
tpo enzyme activity is dependent upon serum tsh in
rats in vivo (6, 7) and in cultured dog thyroid cells in
vitro (8). in dog cells, the effect of tsh on tpo enzyme
activity has been shown to be mediated by camp (8).
regulation of tpo mrna levels by tsh via camp has
also been demonstrated in primary dog thyrocytes (9,
10) and in primary human thyrocytes (11). the tpo
gene has been shown to be transcriptionally regulated in
both primary thyrocytes and thyroid slices from t4treated dogs (10).
the mechanism of rat tpo (rtpo) gene regulation is
less clear. in the differentiated rat thyroid cell line (frtl5), rtpo expression is dependent upon tsh via camp
(12-14). however, transcriptional regulation of the

primer extension analysis of rtpo mrna. primer exten¬
sion analysis was carried out as described previously
(21) using an antisense 30 bp oligonucleotide primer
containing a 21 bp homology to bases 35-15 of the
cdna insert from prtp015-bs (fig. 1). two hundred
units of superscript reverse transcriptase (gibco brl,
gaithersburg, md) was used for the extension reaction.

pharmacological manipulation of

rat tsh (rtsh) serum
levels. various durations, routes of administration, and
doses of  xxxd2594xxx  (mmi) and thyroxine (t4) were
tried. mmi (0.1 g/1 in the rats' drinking water) was
effective in raising serum rtsh at all times tried (8-18
days). tt-feeding (0.5 or 1.0 mg/1 in the rats' water) led
to small but significant decreases in serum rtsh.
injection of t4 instead of, or in addition to, feeding was
found to be superior to t4-feeding alone for lowering
serum rtsh, causing the level to drop more than 50% in
8-10 days. for the experiment described in the results
section and in fig. 3, the duration was eight days. in this
experiment one group served as controls, a second group
was fed 0.1 g/1 mmi in their water and a third group was
given ip-injections of t4 (5 g/100 g) on days 0, 2, 3, 6
and 7 of the study in addition to being fed water

containing 1 mg/i t4.

tsh replacement in hypophysectomized rats. hypophysec¬
tomized rats were obtained from charles river labora¬
tories (wilmington, ma), held for 10 days, and then
each animal was injected daily ip with 1 iu bovine tsh
(sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo) for 1-3 days before
sacrifice.

by ria using rabbit anti-rtsh serum (niddk-anti-

rtsh, whereas injection with t4 significantly
decreased serum rtsh. for example, when animals were
treated for eight days with or without drug, serum rtsh
values (±sem) were 2.9±1.1 ng/ml, n 4; 6.8±1.3
ng/ml, n=3; and 0.8±0.1 ng/ml, n 4; respectively,
for control, mmi treated and t4-treated rats. fig. 3 shows
the results of northern blot analysis of total rna
extracted from the thyroids of these animals. the mmirtsh treated animals, which had elevated serum tsh
levels, also had significantly elevated levels of rtpo
mrna (p < 0.001 ). thyroxine treatment which lowered
serum rtsh levels significantly lowered rtpo mrna
levels (p< 0.001). northern blot analysis of rtpo mrna
clearly resolved a doublet of bands of approximately
equal intensity at 3.2 kb and 3.7 kb. the blot in fig. 3
was also probed for the level of /?-actin mrna as a
control for increases in total mrna synthesis. densito¬
metry values for /?-actin were not significantly different
between the low rtsh (t4-treated) rats and control rats;
however, mmi-treated (high rtsh) rats exhibited signifi¬
cantly higher ß-actin mrna levels (p<0.01). a similar
set of experiments using  xxxd3036xxx  to increase
serum rtsh levels gave similar results (not shown).

effects of tsh injection on rtpo mrna levels in hypophy¬
sectomized rats. in order to confirm that the effect of tsh
on rtpo mrna levels is specific, rather than part of a
general growth stimulation of all mrna species by the
goitrogenic effect of elevated tsh, further experiments
were performed using hypophysectomized rats. these
rats

were

injected, beginning

10

days post-hypophysec-

tomy, with bovine tsh ( 1.0 iu/rat) daily for one to three

days (fig. 4). control hypophysectomized rats had very

low levels of rtpo mrna. the level of rtpo mrna was
stimulated about fourfold over the three days by injec¬
tion with 1.0 iu/day bovine tsh. /?-actin levels did not
differ significantly between any of the days. interest¬
ingly, the 3.2 kb message was stimulated to a much
greater extent than the 3.7 kb message by tsh treat¬
ment, causing the ratio of the two bands to increase from
1.2:1 on day 0 to 3:1 on days 2 and 3.

discussion
tpo mrna levels have been clearly demonstrated to be
transcriptionally regulated in dog thyroid cells and slices
(10). however, transcriptional regulation of the rtpo
gene in the cultured rat thyroid cell line (frtl-5) could
not be demonstrated, and non-transcriptional mechan¬
isms of regulation have been proposed (13, 14). because
frtl-5 cells are dependent upon tsh for maintaining
growth, differentiated function and long-term survival
(15), the physiological relevance of tsh effects on rtpo
gene regulation in this system is equivocal. in this paper
we have attempted to study tsh regulation of rtpo
mrna levels in an in vivo system as a prelude to more
extensive studies of rtpo gene regulation by transcrip¬
tional and non-transcriptional mechanisms.

the rtpo cdna clone which we isolated (prtpol 5bs) is nearly full length, as judged by primer extension
analysis. at the 3' end of the cdna, our cdna clone
contains an additional 10 bp to that reported by derwahl
et al. (20), and an additional 6 bp to that reported by
isozaki et al. (14). the apparent polyadenylation signal
(attaaa), which begins 22 bp upstream from the poly
a tail, differs slightly from the canonical aataaa

signal.

derwahl et al. (20) have published the atg at position
own rtpo cdna sequence as the start of
translation. however, hydropathic analysis (25) of
protein translated from this position does not indicate a
sufficiently long hydrophobic domain at the amino
terminus to code for a signal peptide. we propose instead
that translation begins at the atg in position 31 of their
sequence (base 66 of the full-length cdna based on the
cap site reported here), which then gives a sufficiently
long hydrophobic domain to constitute a signal peptide.
the in vivo results presented here support the pre¬
vious studies with cultured rat thyroid cell lines indicat¬
ing an important role for tsh in rtpo mrna expression.
the correlation of rtpo mrna levels with serum rtsh
in mmi-treated animals suggests that the steady-state
levels of rtpo mrna are regulated by rtsh in vivo.
however, the control mrna used in this study, /j-actin,
was also stimulated, presumably by the goitrogenic
effects of high serum rtsh. additionally, leer et al. (26)
have observed that mmi at concentrations of 1 mm or
greater directly increase tpo mrna levels in frtl-5
cells and human primary thyrocytes. it was therefore
necessary to confirm the specificity of the effect of rtsh
on rtpo mrna levels by using tsh replacement in
hypophysectomized animals.
hypophysectomized animals (10 days postoperative)
had a very decreased level of rtpo mrna. injection of
the rats with bovine tsh increased the rtpo mrna level
fourfold over a period of three days. it is interesting to
note that the ratio of 3.2 kb to 3.7 kb rtpo mrnas,
which is close to unity in control animals and in animals
treated with mmi or t4, is greatly increased by tsh
stimulation in the hypophysectomized animals. this
increased ratio may be due to rna processing. perhaps
the larger rna species represents rtpo with one intron
still intact. splicing of this final intron to yield the 3.2 kb
mrna could represent an additional level of regulation
for rtpo gene expression. interestingly, in human tpo
cdna the first intron ends just before the start of
translation (27). alternatively, the two species of rtpo
mrna might represent mrna's containing different
lengths of 3'-untranslated mrna. the presence of a
slightly altered polyadenylation signal in the 3.2 kb
cdna species which we cloned might suggest that a
second, longer mrna with a canonical polyadenylation
site might also exist. however, in this case the reason for
the preferential enhancement of the 3.2 kb message in
response to tsh would be less clear.
damante et al. (14) have suggested that rtpo mrna
40 of their

466

rat frtl-5 cells are regulated by a decrease in
the rate of degradation of the mrna rather than by an
increase in transcription. although the results presented
here are not inconsistent with such an interpretation,
this interpretation presupposes a constitutive rate of
rtpo mrna production in rat thyroid tissue in the
absence of tsh. ten days after hypophysectomy, the
level of rtpo mrna in the thyroids of hypophysecto¬
mized rats is only about 10% that of control rats (not
shown), and at least some of this rtpo mrna may be
residual. in addition, the demonstration of transcriptional control by tsh of the dog tpo gene (10) and tsh
stimulation of the promoter of the human tpo gene (28)
suggests the likelihood of a similar mechanism of
regulation in the rat. the hypophysectomized rat model
should be extremely useful for future studies of rtpo
