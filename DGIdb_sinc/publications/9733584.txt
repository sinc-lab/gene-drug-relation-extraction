prostaglandin f alpha and its analogue  xxxd2446xxx , both  xxxg1878xxx  agonists, reduce the
#
intraocular pressure mainly by enhancing uveoscleral outflow. changes in the extracellular matrix of the
ciliary muscle may be involved in the increased outflow. the effect of  xxxd2446xxx  and prostaglandin f alpha
#
on the extracellular matrix of the ciliary muscle was investigated.
cell cultures of human ciliary muscle were treated with  xxxd2446xxx  acid or prostaglandin f alpha for 1–2
#
days and were immunostained against various extracellular matrix components and metalloproteinases.
proteinases were also analysed by zymography and by measuring plasmin generating ability. for
comparison, matrix components were immunolocalized on tissue sections from monkey eyes, treated
topically once daily with  xxxd2446xxx  for 10 days.
in response to both prostaglandins collagens i, iii, and iv, fibronectin, laminin and hyaluronan were
reduced, while metalloproteinase -2 and -3 were increased. zymography demonstrated the presence of
functionally active metalloproteinase -2. both prostaglandins enhanced the generation of plasmin, an
activator of metalloproteinases. in the anterior part of the ciliary muscle in  xxxd2446xxx -treated eyes
immunostained collagen vi was decreased in 5 out of 5 monkeys and collagen iv was decreased in 4 of
the 5 monkeys.
these results suggest a role for  xxxd2446xxx  in the remodeling of extracellular matrix in the ciliary
muscle. a  xxxd2446xxx -induced change in the extracellular matrix might augment the flow of aqueous
humour through the ciliary muscle bundles of the uveoscleral pathway.

1. introduction
 xxxd2446xxx  (xalatan2), a phenyl-substituted synthetic analogue of prostaglandin (pg) f alpha-isopropy#
lester, has been shown to be an effective intraocular
pressure (iop)-lowering agent in normal, ocular
hypertensive and glaucomatous eyes (nagasubramanian et al., 1993 ; alm et al., 1993). the
hypotensive action of pgf alpha and  xxxd2446xxx , both fp
#
receptor agonists (stjernschantz et al., 1995) has been
attributed to an increase in uveoscleral outflow of
aqueous humour (crawford, kaufman and gabelt,
1987 ; nilsson et al., 1989 ; stjernschantz et al., 1995 ;
toris et al. 1997). the increase in uveoscleral outflow
caused by pgf alpha could be related to a loss of
#
extracellular matrix (ecm) between the ciliary muscle
bundles, thereby facilitating aqueous humour outflow
(lu$ tjen-drecoll and tamm, 1988a ; tamm, lu$ tjendrecoll and rohen, 1990a).
the ciliary muscle is composed of bundles of smooth
muscle cells embedded in connective tissue. the
expression of connective tissue is sparse in the
longitudinal part of the muscle and more abundant in
correspondence should be addressed to : a. ocklind, dep. pharmacology, pharmacia & upjohn ab (publ), s-751 82 uppsala,

the radial and circular parts (ischikawa, 1962). the
distribution of the major components of the ecm of the
ciliary muscle has been delineated in immunohistochemical studies of collagens i, iii, iv and vi, laminin,
fibronectin and elastin (rittig et al., 1990). the
extracellular environment provides structural support
and organization of tissue and regulates cell physiology. collagen i and iii are interstitial fibril-forming
proteins which may serve as motile structural scaffolds
(linsenmayer, 1992). collagen iv and the glycoprotein laminin have central structural and functional
roles in basal laminae (timpl, 1989). collagen vi is a
constituent of the beaded filaments in connective
tissue stroma and may act as a linkage protein
between different elements in the extracellular matrix
(timpl and engel, 1987). fibronectin is a multifunctional glycoprotein in connective tissue stroma
and in the external lamina that envelops smooth
muscle cells (yamada, 1992). hyaluronan is a
glucosaminoglycan in connective tissue and plays a
critical role in the maintenance of fluid homeostasis
(laurent and fraser, 1992).
the extracellular matrix is a system with slow
continuous biosynthesis and degradation of its components. the degradation process is initiated mainly by
locally secreted matrix metalloproteinases (mmps)
(nagase, 1994) and to a lesser extent by serine
# 1998 academic press

180

proteinases (alexander and werb, 1991). the enzymes are secreted as inactive proenzymes which are
activated in a step-wise manner. the serine proteinase
plasmin has been reported to activate several mmps by
limited proteolysis (werb et al., 1977 ; alexander and
werb, 1991).  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  cleave collagen iv,
denatured collagens and proteoglycans.  xxxg1437xxx 
cleaves fibronectin, denatured collagens, laminin and
proteoglycans and may also be involved in the
proteolytic activation of procollagenases. interstitial
collagens, e.g. types i, ii, iii and v, are cleaved by the
collagenases  xxxg1418xxx , -8 and -13 (nagase, 1994 ;
mitchell et al., 1996). the activated mmps can be
inactivated by specific inhibitors belonging to the
family of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases
(nagase, 1994).
this study was undertaken to investigate the
mechanisms by which  xxxd2446xxx  increases the
uveoscleral outflow, specifically whether  xxxd2446xxx 
induces alterations in the extracellular matrix of the
ciliary muscle. various ecm components and mmps
were immunolocalized in human ciliary muscle cells
grown in the absence or presence of  xxxd2446xxx  or
pgf alpha and the results compared. to allow comparison
#
to the in vivo situation, tissue sections of the ciliary
muscle from  xxxd2446xxx -treated monkey eyes were
also immunostained for the ecm components.

2. materials and methods
isolation and characterization of cultured ciliary
muscle cells
human ciliary muscle cells were isolated and
cultured from adult (71–79 years old) human eyebank eyes essentially as described previously (ocklind
et al., 1996). briefly, a circumferential scleral incision
was made at the ora serrata, separating the globe into
anterior and posterior portions, and the lens and the
iris were removed. the ciliary muscle was excised at
the scleral spur and positioned with the posterior
surface upwards. the pars plicata region including the
ciliary processes and the circular portion of the ciliary
muscle was removed. the ciliary epithelial layers and
vessels on the posterior side and the choroidal cells on
the anterior side were peeled and scraped off from the
ciliary muscle. the cells from the longitudinal and
parts of radial ciliary muscle were dispersed by cutting
the tissue into 1 mm$ pieces which were incubated in
0±1 % collagenase ii (sigma chemical co., st louis,
mo, u.s.a.) for approximately 45 min at 37°c.
the dispersed cells were cultured in 45 % dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium, 45 % ham’s f-12 medium,
10 % fetal calf serum and 50 µg ml−" gentamicin (all
from life technologies, paisley, u.k.) (complete
medium), supplemented with 1 ng ml−" fibroblast
growth factor-2 and 5 ng ml−" platelet-derived growth
factor bb (both from sigma), at 37°c in 5 % co
#
humidified air. the pg experiments were performed in

a. o c k l i n d

50 % dulbecco’s modified eagle medium, 50 % ham’s
f-12 medium, 0±5 % bovine  xxxg124xxx  and 50 µg
ml−" gentamicin (basal medium), supplemented with
pgs. presence of ciliary muscle cells was confirmed by
transmission electron microscopy. cells of passages 2
and 6 were grown to sub-confluence in complete
medium and were starved for 2 days in basal medium.
the cells were then fixed in situ in 2 % glutaraldehyde
and 1 % paraformaldehyde in 0±2  cacodylate buffer,
ph 7±4, overnight at 4°c. after postfixation in 1 %
osmium tetroxide, the specimens were dehydrated in
alcohol, embedded in epon, sectioned and contrast
stained in lead citrate and uranyl acetate.
the identity and purity of the cells were also
assessed immunocytochemically with antibodies
against smooth muscle alpha-actin, desmin, fibroblast
surface protein, cytokeratin, endothelial surface protein and the  xxxg1878xxx  (table i), as previously
described (ocklind et al., 1995 ; 1996).
culture of cells for immunocytochemistry
human ciliary muscle cells (passages 3–5) in
complete medium, supplemented with 1 ng ml−" fibroblast growth factor-2 and 5 ng ml−" platelet-derived
growth factor bb, were grown to confluence in 8-well
glass chamber slides (nunc, roskilde, denmark) at
37°c in 5 % co humidified atmosphere. the cells
#
were briefly rinsed and starved in basal medium
supplemented with 50 µg ml−"  xxxd228xxx  (sigma)
for 2 days. the medium was removed and fresh basal
medium including 0±01–1 µ pgf alpha or  xxxd2446xxx 
#
acid (the active form of  xxxd2446xxx  ; stjernschantz et
al., 1995) were added in parallel experiments. cells
cultured in basal medium only, or in medium
supplemented with 0±5 ng ml−" transforming growth
factor  xxxg836xxx  (sigma) served as negative and positive
(lawrence, hartman and sohenshein, 1994) controls,
respectively. to avoid methodological errors control
media and media with the different pg concentrations
were included in the same 8-well chamber slide. the
experiments were run for 24–48 hr. to prevent
secretion of synthesized proteins, samples that were to
be immunostained for mmps were exposed to 3 µ
monensin (sigma) (okada et al., 1992) during the last
5 hr of the culture. the potential reversibility of effects
by pgs was tested by replacing the pg-containing
media after the completed incubation time with basal
medium, supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum, and
further incubating the cells for 24 hr.
animals and tissue preparation
animals were treated in accordance with the arvo
statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and
vision research. three cynomolgus monkeys
(macaca fascicularis) were unilaterally exposed to
ocular topical treatment with 3 µg of  xxxd2446xxx  once
a day for 10 days. in two additional monkeys, the dose

was increased to 10 µg. the contralateral eyes
received vehicle only. the monkeys were then deeply
anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a
mixture of ketamine (20 mg kg−" body weight) and
xylazine (1±5 mg kg−" body weight). three of the
monkeys were then perfused intracardially with 4 %
neutral buffered paraformaldehyde, whereas two
monkeys were perfused with the same fixative including 1 % (w}v) cetyl pyridinium chloride, a cationic
surfactant which prevents solubilization of glycans
(lu$ tjen-drecoll et al., 1988b). the eyes were enucleated, further fixed for a total of 7 hr, embedded in
paraffin and cut into 5 µm sections.
immunofluorescense staining of cultured cells
the antibodies used are listed in table i. for
immunolocalization of ecm molecules, the cells were
washed briefly with 0±1  tris buffered saline (tbs),
ph 7 and fixed for 10 min in a zinc fixative (beckstead,
1994). after 2 washes in tbs, the cells were further
fixed and permeabilized in kryofix (merck, darmstadt,
germany) for 2 min followed by washing 2¬5 min in
phosphate buffered saline, ph 7±4 (pbs). cells that
were to be stained for hyaluronan were fixed in 4 %

paraformaldehyde including 1 % cetyl pyridinium
chloride for 10 min instead of the above fixatives.
remaining free aldehydes were blocked by incubating
in 50 m ammonium chloride for 30 min. nonspecific binding was reduced by incubation in protein
block solution (dako) for 20 min. after removal of the
solution the cells were covered with primary antibodies
to collagens i, iii, iv and vi,  xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1437xxx ,  xxxg1440xxx ,
laminin, fibronectin and with hyaluronan binding
protein respectively (table i). after incubation for
2 hr the slides were dipped in pbs including 0±01 %
triton x-100 and then washed 2¬5 min in pbs.
secondary polyclonal antibodies (dako) included biotinylated goat anti-rabbit igg, 1 : 300, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse igg, 1 : 20,
and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine
anti-rabbit igg, 1 : 20, respectively. binding of the
biotinylated antibody and hyaluronan binding protein
was visualized with streptavidin-conjugated texas
red (1 : 100 ; amersham, bucks, u.k.). nuclear
counterstaining was performed on some slides by
including 1±25 µg ml−"  xxxd2284xxx  during the
final incubation. the slides were mounted in an
antifade mounting medium (prolong antifade kit ;
molecular probes, eugene, or, u.s.a.).

immunoperoxidase staining of tissue sections

zymography

five-µm paraffin sections were deparaffinized and
dehydrated and endogenous peroxidase activity was
inhibited by a 15 min incubation in 0±3 % hydrogen
peroxide. as recommended by the manufacturers, the
fixed tissues used for the fibronectin and laminin
stainings were predigested with 0±1 % trypsin (dako)
in 0±1 % calcium chloride solution for 15 min. endogenous biotin and avidin were blocked with a
10 min incubation in each of two blocking solutions
(avidin}biotin blocking kit ; vector laboratories, burlingame, ca, u.s.a.). non-specific binding was blocked
with 0±1 % bovine  xxxg124xxx  in pbs or with 5 %
serum from the species of the secondary antibody for
20 min. sections were then incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4°c. the immunoreactive
proteins were visualized by the avidin-biotin procedure
(vectastain elite abc peroxidase kit ; vector laboratories) using 0±05 % 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole. the
slides were counterstained in hematoxylin and mounted in glycerol-gelatin. after each step in the staining
procedure, the slide was dipped in pbs and washed
2¬5 min in pbs supplemented with 0±1 % bovine
 xxxg124xxx .

functional activity of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  was
tested with gelatin zymography (kleiner and stetlerstevenson, 1994). confluent cells in petri dishes were
starved in mcdb-104 medium (life technologies)
containing 0±2 % bsa and 10 m hepes for 24 hr
and were then stimulated with 0±01–1 µ  xxxd2446xxx 
acid in the described starving medium for 24 hr. media
samples were collected. after homogenization and
centrifugation of the cells, supernatants were collected.
the protein concentration of all samples was determined (pierce protein assay, boule, nordic ab,
huddinge, sweden). the lowest protein concentration
found among the samples was chosen for loading the
zymography gels. samples (19 µg protein of media
samples}well and 4 µg of cellular proteins}well) were
subjected to  xxxd3215xxx  polyacrylamide
gelectrophoresis on 10 % acrylamide gel containing
1 mg ml−" gelatin under non-reducing conditions.
protein standards (rainbow4 colored protein molecular weight markers ; 14–220 k ; amersham, buckinghamshire, england) were run under reducing
conditions. after washing in 2±5 % triton x-100, the
gels were incubated in activation buffer consisting of
50 m tris–hcl and 5 m  xxxg2125xxx  ph 8 at 37°c for
#
20 hr and stained with 0±1 % comassie brilliant blue
in 10 % acetic acid and 50 % methanol. gelatinolytic
activity was visualized as clear zones against a blue
background.

control staining
when primary antibodies were substituted with
pbs or with corresponding concentrations of normal
rabbit igg or normal mouse igg, no staining was
noted. specificity of the antibodies has been established
by the companies from which they were obtained. the
 xxxg1878xxx  antibodies have previously been described
(ocklind et al., 1997). the hyaluronan staining
was removed by pretreatment of the specimens with
50 u ml−" streptomyces hyalurolyticus hyaluronidase
(sigma) for 2 hr at 37°c (rippelino et al., 1985).

microscopical evaluation and photography
the slides were examined at ¬400 magnification
under a nikon microphot  xxxg741xxx  microscope (nikon,
tokyo, japan) equipped with epifluorescent illumination and filters for rhodamine}texas red and
hoechst fluorochromes. the expression of immunoreactive material in each sample (1 cm# culture area)
was semiquantified on a linear 7-step arbitrary scale
ranging from 0–3, where 0, 1, 2 and 3 corresponds to
no, small, medium and large expression, respectively.
for the tissue sections, only the anterior part of the
longitudinal ciliary muscle was evaluated by the
described scoring. micrographs were taken with a
fixed exposure time within each ecm component
group. to obtain optimum fluorescence the photographs of ecm staining and nuclei counterstaining
were taken separately.

assay for plasmin generating activity
cells (20 000 well−") in serum-free medium were
seeded on collagen i-coated 96-well plates and were
allowed to adhere overnight. different concentrations
of  xxxd2446xxx  acid or pgf alpha and 10 µg ml−" plas#
minogen (sigma) were added and the cells incubated
for a further 24 hr. media aliquots were transferred to
another plate containing pbs and 25 µg well−" plasmin chromogenic substrate (s2390, chromogenix,
mo$ lndal, sweden). wells with culture medium including 1 µg ml−" plasmin (chromogenics) served as
positive control. after incubation for approximately
3 hr at 37°c, the absorbances of the colored solutions
were measured at 405 nm.
statistics
statistical significance was tested by kruskal-wallis
one-way analysis of variance for scores and by twotailed t-test.

teristics of smooth muscle cells such as plasmalemmal
vesicles and myofilaments with associated dense bodies
(chamley-campbell, campbell and ross, 1979). these
myofilaments and vesicles were most prominent at the
periphery of the cells [fig. 1(a)].
phase contrast microscopy of confluent cultures
showed that the fusiform cells were evenly distributed
in a monolayer, resembling parallel bands. at postconfluence, dense ridge-shaped areas, were formed by
the cells (chamley-campbell, campbell and ross,
1979). between passages 2 and 6, at least 95 % of the
cells contained the microfilament smooth muscle alphaactin which appeared as intensely stained parallel
strands throughout the cytoplasm [fig. 1(b)]. immunoreactivity for the intermediate filament desmin
was easily discernable in about 5 % of the cells but
barely detectable in the remaining cells. both filament
markers were present in the intact ciliary muscle.
about 5 % of the cultured cells expressed fibroblast
surface protein seen as a punctuate staining pattern,
indicating that these cells were fibroblasts (ro$ nnovjessen et al., 1992). no cells stained with the antibody
against cytokeratins- 8 and 18 which are present in
ciliary epithelial cells (uusitalo and kivela, 1995) or
against  xxxg1724xxx  which is found in vascular endothelial
cells (parums et al., 1990). more than 90 % of the cells
were immunopositive for the  xxxg1878xxx , visualized
throughout the cytoplasm [fig. 1(c)]. population
doubling time during the first 6 passages was about
24 hr when the cells were grown in complete medium
(not shown).

results. however, pgf alpha tended to be more effective

less pronounced for pgf alpha than for  xxxd2446xxx  acid.

both pgs induced mmps equally well.
collagen i staining of cultured ciliary muscle cells with
antibodies to collagen i resulted in an immunoreaction
that was mainly cell-associated. since the cells were
permeabilized during the fixation procedure, it could
not be determined whether the immunoreaction was
intracellular or extracellular, or both. in between the
cells the immunoreaction was seen as fine interconnected strands. after treatment with  xxxd2446xxx 
acid the overall immunoreaction was reduced [fig.

parallel and interwoven strands.  xxxd2446xxx  acidtreatment resulted in a reduced cell-associated immunoreaction and a reduced density of stained
material between the cells [fig. 2(c), (d)].
collagen iv the control cultures were intensely stained
for collagen iv. immunopositive strands closely surrounded each cell and accumulated where the ends of
the cells were intertwined. addition of  xxxd2446xxx  acid
resulted in a reduced number of strands, particularly
at the ends of the cells and the overall impression was
that the stained monolayer had a looser meshwork
[fig. 2(e)–(h)]. at the end of the experiments the
 xxxd2446xxx  acid-containing media of some cultures
were replaced with basal medium supplemented with
10 % fetal calf serum and further incubated for 1 day.

immunostaining of these cultures indicated a denser
meshwork with narrower meshes, thus indicating that
the effect of  xxxd2446xxx  acid was reversible (not
shown).
fibronectin staining of fibronectin in the control
cultures revealed an extensive fibrous network in the
control cultures [fig. 3(a), (d)]. after stimulation with
 xxxd2446xxx  acid the fibronectin network was visualized as discontinuous and less dense [fig. 3(c), (f)].
in cultures incubated in the presence of transforming
growth factor  xxxg836xxx  for 48 h, the fibronectin network
appeared more dense, thus these cultures served as
positive control [fig. 3(b), (e)].

were stained with antibodies against various extracellular
matrix components and the intensity of immunostained
material in the anterior longitudinal muscle was scored.
differences in scores between treated and untreated contralateral eyes were plotted. graph shows the combined data
from 5 monkeys, where each point represents the mean of 6
determinations. p ! 0±05 for collagen vi versus control
stainings by paired t-test for the mean scores.

staining was seen in the anterior longitudinal muscle
where the tissue was compact. as the effects of
 xxxd2446xxx  were most evident in the anterior part of
the muscle, mainly represented by longitudinal muscle
fibers, the staining in this region was evaluated by
semi-quantitative scoring. this region represents the
entrance to the uveoscleral pathway (bill, 1977).
among the collagens the staining for collagen iv was
the most intense and was uniformly distributed along
the muscle fibers [fig. 4(a)–(d)]. in 4 out of 5
monkeys treatment with  xxxd2446xxx  resulted in
weaker labeling but an unaltered staining pattern [fig.
4(b), (d)], while in one monkey no effect could be
detected. collagen vi was predominantly localized to
the anterior part of the muscle and was visualized as
patchy staining between the muscle fiber bundles and
as uniform staining along the bundles [fig. 4(e)]. in
the  xxxd2446xxx -treated eyes of all 5 monkeys the
stained patches were apparently decreased in size and
labeling intensity compared to the contralateral
untreated eyes [fig. 4(e), (f)]. weak immunoreaction of collagens i and iii were observed in
between and among the muscle bundles, of which
collagen iii was the least intense. no distinct changes
in immunoreactivity of these interstitial collagens
were observed between experimental and control eyes.
staining for laminin seen as delicate lines along the
muscle fibers and staining for fibronectin which had a
more diffuse appearance, were similar in control and
experimental eyes (fig. 5). as the tissue sections must
be fixed in ethanol to observe mmp antibodies, these
antibodies were not used.

zymography
gelatin substrate zymography demonstrated that
ciliary muscle cells secreted  xxxg1428xxx  that was capable
of degrading gelatin.  xxxd2446xxx  further stimulated
this process, as evaluated by the observed zones of lysis
in the approximate 66 kd region (fig. 6). the most
prominent clear zone was seen in lane 4, which
contained medium from cells cultured in the presence
of 1 µ  xxxd2446xxx  acid.  xxxg1440xxx  was not detected and
pgf alpha and was not tested.
#
plasmin generating activity
ciliary muscle cells were able to convert exogenous
plasminogen into plasmin. this process was enhanced
by  xxxd2446xxx  acid and pgf alpha (fig. 7), as evaluated by
#
absorbance measurements of a plasmin-associated
chromogenic substrate.
4. discussion
the aim of this work was to study the mechanism
for  xxxd2446xxx -enhanced uveoscleral outflow. immunocytochemistry was used on cultured human
ciliary muscle cells as well as on tissue sections to
examine the effects of  xxxd2446xxx  on ecm components

effect of  xxxd2446xxx  on ciliary muscle

of the ciliary muscle. exposure of cultured cells to
 xxxd2446xxx  acid and its analogue pgf alpha resulted in a
#
decreased expression of ecm components, and an
increased expression of metalloproteinases and in the
ability of the cells to convert plasminogen into plasmin.
on the tissue sections  xxxd2446xxx  decreased the
expression of collagen vi in all treated eyes and
decreased collagen iv in 4 out of 5 treated eyes, while
no changes could be clearly demonstrated for other
matrix material.
the established ciliary muscle cells retained typical
characteristics of smooth muscle cells for at least 6
passages. however, immunoreactive desmin, a smooth
muscle intermediate filament, was lost by continuous
culture and may implicate an onset of transition into
myofibroblasts (sappino, schurch and gabbiani,
1990). using immunocytochemistry, no cells were
identified as epithelial or endothelial cells, about 5 %
were identified as fibroblasts, suggesting that the
cultures were essentially pure at the passages used.
except for collagen vi, the cells synthesized the ecm
components which have been demonstrated in intact
ciliary muscle (lu$ tjen-drecoll et al., 1988b ; tamm,
rittig and lu$ tjen-drecoll, 1990b) and in cultured
ciliary muscle cells (tamm, baur and lu$ tjen-drecoll,
1992). it is unclear why the cultured cells, contrary to
the muscle tissue, did not express collagen vi.
alterations in collagen metabolism have been described for cultured vascular smooth muscle cells
(leushner and haust, 1986). hyaluronan expression
increased considerably in the cultured cells compared
to the faint staining found in intact muscle in this
study and by others (lu$ tjen-drecoll et al., 1988b)
which was possibly due to the in vitro conditions.
nonetheless, since the ciliary muscle cells retained
many of their in vivo characteristics, this cell culture
technique can be regarded as a useful in vitro model
for studies of the ecm. this model enabled the use of
human tissue and also enabled more extensive
investigations under more reproducible conditions
compared to in vivo situation.
in the cell culture model we found that the
concentration of  xxxd2446xxx  acid which resulted in
most pronounced immunocytochemical effects correspond to the clinical concentrations of  xxxd2446xxx 
acid in the aqueous humour after topical application of
a single dose (1±5 µg) of xalatan2 (sjo$ quist et al.,
1997). during a 24 hr period, the concentration in the
aqueous humour was reported to vary from 1 n to
0±1 µ. by contrast, in the experiments of zymography
and plasmin generating activity, the highest concentration tested (1 µ) resulted in the strongest
effects.
in this in vitro study the expression of collagen i, iii,
iv, fibronectin, laminin and hyaluronan appeared to
be decreased, suggesting a stimulatory effect of
 xxxd2446xxx  acid on the reduction of matrix components or an inhibitory effect on the synthesis. our
finding of the agonist-induced expression of  xxxg1428xxx 

189

and  xxxg1437xxx  in the ciliary muscle cells suggests that
the decrease in matrix material might be due to
proteolytic degradation. however, mmps are in the
proenzyme form when inside the cell, may be activated
after secretion, and finally inactivated by forming
complexes with enzyme inhibitors (nagase, 1994).
immunolocalization could not distinguish between
intracellular and pericellular mmps. since the antibodies were directed against all enzyme forms it could
not be determined whether the immunostained mmps
were active or inactive. zymography demonstrated
firstly that the cells secreted  xxxg1428xxx , secondly that
 xxxg1428xxx  degraded gelatin and thirdly that the amount
of degraded gelatin was increased by  xxxd2446xxx  acid.
whether the  xxxg1428xxx  was in its active (about 65 kd) or
latent form (72 kd) after secretion (hipps et al., 1991 ;
rawdanowicz et al., 1994), could not be established
since the sds in the electrophoresis sample buffer may
have activated the enzyme (hipps et al., 1991). the
assay for plasmin generation from plasminogen demonstrated that  xxxd2446xxx  acid and pgf alpha increased
#
this activity, presumably by stimulating urokinase, the
enzyme that converts plasminogen into plasmin in the
pericellular area (alexander and werb, 1991). since
plasmin may activate procollagenases (werb et al.,
1977 ; alexander and werb, 1991) altogether our
results taken together, indicate that  xxxd2446xxx  and
pgf alpha stimulate tissue remodeling. other authors have
#
shown that treatment with pgf alpha of cultured human
#
ciliary muscle cells results in a decrease of collagens i,
iii, iv and laminin and an increase in the levels of
prommp-1 and -3. (lindsey et al., 1996 ; 1997). under
similar conditions,  xxxd2446xxx  acid was shown to
reduce the expression of collagen i and iii (weinreb,
lindsey and kashiwagi, 1997).
since the ciliary muscle cell model reported here is
an in vitro system, immunohistochemical effect studies
were also performed in vivo on monkey eyes. there
were discrepancies between the in vitro model and the
in vivo findings. all ecm components studied were
significantly decreased in vitro upon addition of
 xxxd2446xxx  acid while statistically significant decreases in vivo were obtained only for collagen vi.
however, overall there tended to be a decrease in
collagen iv in vivo and in 4 out of 5 monkeys a
general decrease of this collagen was also found in
response to  xxxd2446xxx . apart from the species and
environmental differences, the observed difference
between the in vitro and in vivo experiments may be
explained by exposure time. cultured cells were
exposed to  xxxd2446xxx  acid for 1–2 days compared to
10 days in vivo. another contributing factor may be
that in vitro the ciliary muscle cells were exposed to a
steady concentration of  xxxd2446xxx  acid, whereas in
vivo  xxxd2446xxx  acid exposure was pulsed.
as to the in vivo effects of pgf alpha and  xxxd2446xxx  on
#
the ecm of the ciliary muscle, diverging results have
been reported. topical treatment with pgf alpha on
#
monkey eyes has been claimed to result in a widening

190

of the spaces and a reduction in collagens i and iii but
not collagens iv, vi, fibronectin and laminin in the
ciliary muscle (lu$ tjen-drecoll and tamm 1988a ;
tamm et al., 1990b). in other studies on monkeys
treated with pgf alpha (camras et al., 1988) or with
#
 xxxd2446xxx  (svedberg and forsberg, 1993) no morphological changes could be detected. our diverging in
vivo results may be due to the relatively low resolution
of the light microscopic technique or to different
procedures in tissue processing. overall the impression
is that  xxxd2446xxx  and pgf alpha may increase the porosity
#
of the ecm by reducing the content of specific matrix
components.
when the effect of  xxxd2446xxx  acid and pgf alpha were
#
compared in the cell culture model and in the
plasminogen-plasmin assay, pgf alpha was found to be
#
somewhat more effective in decreasing the ecm and
increasing the plasmin generating activity than  xxxd2446xxx . this difference may be explained by their slightly
differing receptor binding profiles ;  xxxd2446xxx  acid is a
more selective  xxxg1878xxx  agonist than
pgf alpha (stjernschantz et al., 1995).
#
in conclusion,  xxxd2446xxx  exhibited a modulating
effect on the ecm in the ciliary muscle. the observed
decrease of matrix components may occur as a result
of decreased synthesis, but more likely due to increased
degradation, or altered regulation of the other ecm
constituents. subtle alterations in cell shape may also
influence ecm architecture, contributing to increased
uveoscleral outflow. in addition, reorganisation of the
collagen may affect the hydraulic conductivity
through the ciliary muscle.
