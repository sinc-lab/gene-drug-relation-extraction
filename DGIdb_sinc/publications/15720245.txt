production, inhibition of neutrophil and endothelial cell adhesion molecules.
the minimal daily dose in adults is 1.0 mg/die, but in children there is not a definite dose.
since in vitro high dosages of  xxxd1740xxx  stop mitosis, this drug might interfere with male and female fertility and with children growth, but,

since  xxxd1740xxx  treatment is often complicated by frequent gastrointestinal side effects, by our experience, in order to improve  xxxd1740xxx 
tolerance we recommend: lactose-free diet and treatment of intestinal bacterial overgrowth and/or hp-infection, assessed by breath tests.
since our data showed that 10-15% of fmf patients seem are non-responders or intolerant to  xxxd1740xxx , today we are working in the design
of  xxxd1740xxx  analogues which may have lesser toxicities and a larger therapeutic window.

introduction
familial mediterranean fever (fmf) is an autosomal recessive
disorder due to a genetically determined inflammatory unbalance.
traditionally, it is common among populations living around southern and
eastern coasts of mediterranean sea: armenians, turks, middle-eastern
moslems, non-ashkenazi jews, but, because of the migrations during the
centuries, fmf is no longer a rare disease in european countries like italy,
france and greece [1].
clinically, fmf is characterised by recurrent, acute, self-limiting
attacks of fever and serositis, lasting on average 24-72 hours; its
inflammatory burst affects serosal membranes, so fmf can cause
symptoms and signs of peritonitis and/or pleuritis and/or pericarditis and/or
sinovitis and/or orchitis.
amyloidosis is the main complication of the disease; it develops in a
small percentage of patients according to genotype (m694v mutation
increase the risk of development) and maybe ancestry. the kidneys are
the main target of amyloidosis, resulting in chronic renal failure and renal
transplant.
it was goldfinger who, as first, has introduced  xxxd1740xxx  to treat fmf
and since 1972 this drug has been the golden standard to prevent fmf
attacks and reduce the risk of amyloidosis.
the use of  xxxd1740xxx  in the previous years has been revised by e.
ben-chetrit and y. molad [2,3].
 xxxd1740xxx , an ancient anti-inflammatory drug, is an alkaloid extracted
from a plant, colchicum autumnale, very common in south-central
europe and in north-central italy (fig. 1).
it has been used for centuries in acute gout arthritis, but its efficacy
has been provided also in other diseases: familial mediterranean fever
(fmf), primary biliary cirrhosis [4,5], psoriasis [6], palmo-plantar
pustolosis [7], necrotizing vasculitis [8], behçet’s syndrome [9], sweet's
syndrome [10], sclerodermia [11], sarcoidosis [12], amyloidosis [13] and
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [14].
the name “ xxxd1740xxx ” has a greek origin: it comes from the name of
the ancient district on the eastern shore of the black sea where this plant
grew. padanius dioscorides, a greek surgeon in the roman army during
the rule of nero (ad 54-68), first described the meadow saffron in his de
materia medica, a pharmacopeia which systematically described about

600 plants. already at dioscoride’s time, the toxicity of  xxxd1740xxx  was
known, but, only after vi century ad, extracts of  xxxd1740xxx  were used to
relief joint pain. alexander of tralles (5.500 ad) mentioned as first the
use of colchico bulbs (named hermadactyl or finger of hermes) as a
remedy for acute gouty arthritis in the “therapeutica”; another citation is
in the ebers papyrus (1.500 ad) [15].

fig. (1). colchicum autumnale.

 xxxd1740xxx  was introduced as a drug for acute gout by baron von
storch, the physician of the empress maria teresa, in 1763, but it was
benjamin franklin, affected himself by gout, that spread this drug as the
most effective therapy for gout.
pelletier and caventou extracted the alkaloid from the bulbs in 1820,
then it was used for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases [2].
since 1972, when goldfinger noticed that a patient affected by gout and
fmf got an improvement of both the clinical conditions,  xxxd1740xxx  has
become the drug of choice for prophylaxis against fmf [16].
structure and pharmacokinetics
 xxxd1740xxx  consists of pale yellow scales or powder, which become
dark when it is exposed to air or light. it is a neutral alkaloid which can be
extracted from two plant of the lily family: colchicum autumnale (meadow
saffron) and gloriosa superba (glory lily).

the absolute configuration was determined by corrodi and hardegger
in 1955.  xxxd1740xxx  is a tricyclic alkaloid, the main features of which
include a trimethoxyphenyl ring (a ring), a seven membered ring (b ring)
with an  xxxd63xxx  at the seven position, and a tropolonic ring (c ring)
(fig. 2).

few pharmacokinetic studies on  xxxd1740xxx  have been fulfilled, and
their results are somewhat contradictory because of the different methods
used to measure  xxxd1740xxx  and because of the heterogeneity of the groups
tested [3].
it is well known that  xxxd1740xxx  is a neutral and slightly soluble in
water and in ether, freely soluble in ethanol and chloroform therefore it is
highly lipid soluble compound at physiologic ph (pka 12,8, mw 398),
which enables its rapid passage into body tissues.
after i.v. administration of 2 mg of  xxxd1740xxx , a rapid rise and drop of
its plasma levels occurred within the first 10 minutes, followed by a
logarithmic decline. the half-life is 19,3±7,5 minutes [17].
after oral administration,  xxxd1740xxx  is absorbed in the jejunum and
ileum with a single zero-order rate process, with a bioavailability ranged
from 25 to 50% [2,3]. it shows a low-affinity binding to albumin and a
large steady-state distribution volume [18]. peak plasma levels, after oral
administration, are reached within 2 hours and its half-life is about of 4
hours, although it can be detected in leukocytes for up to 10 days after
administration [2].

manna et al.

as  xxxd1740xxx  disappears very quickly from plasma and it continues to
be excreted next days after ingestion, it has been hypothesised that this
drug is trapped in body tissues for long time.
in 1996 ferron et al. noticed that, after  xxxd1740xxx  ingestion, there is a
second plasma peak within 6 hours, probably due to a second absorption
site or to enterohepatic re-circulation; however large differences were
observed respecting the time to peak and the peak concentration among
subjects [18]. this could be due to gastro-intestinal mucosal variability, ph
at the absorption site or the rate of  xxxd1740xxx  release from binding
compounds in the bowel.
 xxxd1740xxx  is mainly metabolised by liver and only 10-25% of an oral
dose is recovered unchanged in the urine [2]. hepatic metabolism involves
demethylation by the cytochrome p450 system (cyp 450) and, in
particular, by the isoform cyp 3a4 with production of 3demethylcolchicine and 2-demethylcolchicine [19].
the biological effects of metabolites of  xxxd1740xxx  are unclear,
meanwhile the presence of both metabolites in the bile and intestinal
secretion suggest an enterohepatic re-circulation [20].
urinary excretion accounts for 20% of the i.v. dose at 2 hours and
30% after 24 hours; small but measurable amounts were found in the urine
after 7 and 10 days [21]. for this reason plasma half-life is prolonged in
patients with renal failure, especially when renal and hepatic diseases are
both present [22]. half-life time (t1/2) of  xxxd1740xxx  is prolonged twice or
3 times in patients with renal failure in comparison with healthy subjects,
meanwhile t1/2 is prolonged over 10 times in presence of cirrhosis and
renal failure. thus, patients with renal or liver disease who are on
 xxxd1740xxx  should be carefully monitored for possible toxic effects of the
drug [22].
a recent study has shown the presence of little amounts of  xxxd1740xxx 
in an umbilical cord blood sample suggesting the transplacental passage of
the drug [23]. moreover,  xxxd1740xxx  is present in the breast milk where it
can bind fat acids and proteins.
pharmacodynamics
 xxxd1740xxx  produces its therapeutic effect by interfering with the
inflammatory process. it reduces inflammatory response occurring in gout

fig. (3). interaction between  xxxd1740xxx  and tubulin [26].
a portion of the microtubule lattice is shown in schematic form.
each of three protofilaments shown is composed of alphabeta-dimers. as shown in the inset, the alpha-subunits are white and the beta-subunits are shaded. the contact between alphan and
betac in the isolated dimer is known from cross-linking data, as is the interdimer contact between betan and alphac, observed between dimers in the polymer.
in panel a, a tubulin- xxxd1740xxx  complex is depicted about to add to the growing polymer. the betac domain of the tubulin- xxxd1740xxx  complex is shown to contain a loop
not present in the normal dimer. this represents the area around arg-390 that is unfolded by  xxxd1740xxx  and cleaved by trypsin and chymotrypsin. the contact area between
this dimer and the polymer involves the unaltered alpha-subunit of the  xxxd1740xxx  dimer and the surfaces of the beta-subunit exposed at the end of the polymer. since all of these
surfaces are normal, the dimer can add despite the altered beta-subunit conformation. once added, however (panel b), the altered dimer impedes the addition of a further dimer
longitudinally due to the unfolded loop region of betac, here shown on the distal surface of the polymer. alternatively or in addition, the altered betac region might protrude to
the side, and interfere with the addition of a dimer lateral to it, i.e., the position marked with an asterisk. blocking addition to either position or both would impede
extension of one or both protofilaments and poison the helical growth of the microtubule [26].

pharmacological and clinical basis of treatment of fmf

current drug targets - inflammation & allergy, 2005, vol. 4, no. 1

and fmf, because it is able to prevent activation, degranulation and
migration of neutrophils, binding  xxxg2353xxx  and making  xxxg2353xxx - xxxd1740xxx 
complexes; this way inhibits assembly of microtubules and mitotic spindle
formation [24].
now, it is widely known that its action depends on a and c rings that
bind tubulin [25]. so tropolone methyl ester, an analogue of c ring, and
mescaline, an analogue of a ring, are able to bind tubulin and inhibit
polymerization of microtubules.
the bond between  xxxd1740xxx  and tubulin, as shown by sackett d.l. et
al. on biochemistry [26], induces a conformational change of both the
molecules resulting in a tight complex with modified polymerisation
properties.
the study of tubulin proteolysis by tripsin and chimotrypsin, in
presence or absence of  xxxd1740xxx , has demonstrated that  xxxd1740xxx 
changes the clivage pattern by both the enzymes because it shows two
new binding-sites for these enzymes.
tubulin is an heterodimer consisting of 2 subunits, alpha and beta, bound
together. the contact between alphan and betac in the isolated dimer is due to
cross-linking while the interdimer contact is due to surface betan and alphac
(fig. 3).
 xxxd1740xxx  binds domain c of beta-subunit changing its conformation and
so it prevents the addition of further dimers either longitudinally and
laterally. in any case, inhibitory concentrations of tubulin- xxxd1740xxx 
complexes are lower than free tubulin concentrations.
as  xxxd1740xxx  is able to bind tubulin, it disrupts the mitotic splindle
determining dissolution of microtubules in granulocytes and other cells; this
function can explain its anti-inflammatory action.
 xxxd1740xxx  induce anti-inflammatory effects by:

inhibition of the synthesis of  xxxg2296xxx  alpha ( xxxg2296xxx ) by
macrophages and down-regulation of surface expression of
 xxxg2296xxx -receptor on macrophages and endothelial cells; thus it
interferes with the priming effect of  xxxg2296xxx  on neutrophils before
their activation by monosodium-urate crystals [27,28];

inhibition of leukotriene b4 synthesis, powerful chemiotactic
agent [29,30];

block of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) activity,  xxxd1903xxx 
and thromboxane a2 synthesis of mononuclear phagocytes with
subsequent reduction of swelling and pain in gout and fmf [31];

reduced adhesion of neutrophils to endothelium inhibiting p- and
 xxxg2048xxx -mediated endothelial and l-selectin-mediated
neutrophilic adhesiveness.  xxxd1740xxx  effects on e-selectinmediated endothelial adhesiveness is microtubule-dependent and
occurs at concentrations that are over a thousand-fold lower than
those required to affect neutrophil function. the prophylactic
effect on gout and fmf attacks could just be due to this
mechanism [32,33,34,35];

tyrosine phosphorylation and superoxide anion production
inhibition [36];

 xxxd208xxx  release and  xxxg147xxx  inhibition in alveolar
macrophages [37,38];

suppression of delayed hypersensitivity reactions [39], histamine
[40], insulin [41] and  xxxg1885xxx  release [42].
table 1.

in summary, the most important effect of prophylactic doses of
 xxxd1740xxx  is to prevent chemiotaxis of neutrophils; at higher
concentrations  xxxd1740xxx  reduces the surface expression of l-selectin on
leukocytes, and interferes with the rolling of neutrophils to the
inflammation site; finally at higher concentrations it blocks phospholipase
a2 activation [43], lysosomal enzymes release and phagocytosis;
however, its most strong effect also to inhibit chemiotaxis of neutrophils at
low doses (1x10-8 mol/l). it seems that this effect is related to high
 xxxd1740xxx  concentration in leukocytes, although we do not know why
 xxxd1740xxx  has a special affinity for these cells.
some study showed that, conditions being equal, granulocytes are able
to contain higher concentrations of  xxxd1740xxx  compared to
lymphomonocytes [44]; in patients with fmf,  xxxd1740xxx  concentration in
granulocytes is on average threefold that in lymphomonocytes [45]. this
fact is due to the different activity in these two cellular populations of a pglycoprotein efflux pump, encoded by the multiple drug resistance gene 1
(mdr 1), which can bind  xxxd1740xxx  and expels the drug from cells.
klimecki et al. investigated the p-glycoprotein pump expression in
circulating blood cells and found that granulocytes, opposite to
lymphomonocytes, have small amount of this pump and it is not primarily
localized in their membrane [45]. this could be the reason why  xxxd1740xxx 
is mainly amassed in the granulocytes.
nobody until now has investigated if fmf patients non-responders to
 xxxd1740xxx  could have an higher activity of p-glicoprotein pump in their
granulocytes compared to responders.
 xxxd1740xxx  drug interactions
 xxxd1740xxx  alters absorption of nutrients and other drugs from bowel
[46]. oral administration of  xxxd1740xxx  induces  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  malabsorption,
possibly by reducing intrinsic factor receptors on intestinal mucosa, and
lactose intolerance [47,48]. it produces mucosal injury characterised by a
hyperplastic crypt-villous atrophy pattern and increased mitotic rate [49].
 xxxd1740xxx  interferes with other drugs because of its metabolism by cyp
450 (isoform cyp 3a4) [50] (table 1).
inhibitors of cyp 450 (as cimetidine) and cyp 450 3a4 (as diltiazem,
grapefruit juice, erythromycin) induce reduction of  xxxd1740xxx  metabolism
and consequently increase  xxxd1740xxx  blood levels, whereas inducers of
cyp 450 (as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin) work in opposite way.
substrates of cyp 450 3a4 (as lovastatin, cyclosporin, verapamil,
oestrogen, steroids) are affected by co-administration of  xxxd1740xxx .
subscriptions
 xxxd1740xxx  is currently indicated for the treatment of gouty arthritis
acute attacks [51], for prophylaxis during intercritical phases and in the
late chronic tophaceous phase as well for prophylaxis of attacks and
prevention of aa-amyloidosis in fmf.
it is also used in behçet’s disease and primary biliary cirrhosis, while
it is not clear its effect on scleroderma, sarcoidosis, necrotizing
vasculitis, palmo-plantar pustulosis, sweet’s syndrome and psoriasic
arthritis.
the drug can be given orally and intravenously, which has lower toxic
gastrointestinal effects but the risk of serious and even fatal toxic effects
related to this administration route have encouraged the removal of the

intravenous preparation from the pharmacopoeia. in italy, only tablets are
available.
in case of intravenous  xxxd1740xxx , the following guidelines and
resections are firmly recommended [52]:

intravenous and oral  xxxd1740xxx  should not be given
concomitantly. if the patient has not responded to  xxxd1740xxx  or he
is already taking maintenance doses, an alternative drug should be
used in place of further  xxxd1740xxx ;

the doses must be reduced by at least 50% in patients with renal or
hepatic disease and in elderly patients. the drug should not be
used at all at creatinine clearance below 10 ml/min. it must be
emphasized that  xxxd1740xxx  is not removable by dialysis or
exchange transfusion;

 xxxd1740xxx  should not be given to patients with combined liver and
kidney disease;

the intravenous dose should be given cautiously and slowly to
minimize the risk of extravasation;

single intravenous dose should be no greater than 2-3 mg, and no
more than a cumulative total dose of 4 mg/die.
based on these guidelines,  xxxd1740xxx  may be given at an initial dose
of 2.0 mg following by 2 additional doses of 1 mg every 6 hours for a
maximal total dose of 4 mg/die.
dosage and efficacy
for preventing fmf attacks, the minimal daily dose in adults is 1.0
mg/die. in children there is not definite dose, but it must be adjusted
according to their body weight and surface area.
a recent study has determined the “effective  xxxd1740xxx  dose” for
children in terms of body weight and surface area: for children less that 5
years of age is 0.07 mg/kg/day or 1.9 mg/m2/day, while for the others it is
0.03±0.02 mg/kg/day or 1.16±0.45 mg/m2 /day. [53]. following plasma
serum amyloid protein (saa) concentrations may guide us in monitoring
the dosage of the drug, as well as the clinical feature and serum creactive protein (crp) levels [54].
when the attacks are not controlled, the dose may be increased to 2.0
mg daily, meanwhile an higher dose should be given only for short period
to avoid toxicity.
in patients with renal failure, general dosing guidelines [20] are
shown in table 2.

the literature data show that 60% of fmf patients treated with
 xxxd1740xxx  experiment complete remission, 30% significant improvement
while 15% are non responders [3], but our data point out that only 5% of
fmf patients have complete remission, 80% strong improvement with
reduction of number and severity of attacks and 10-15% are nonresponders or intolerant.
drug discontinuation results in relapse in most patients within a few
days.
since  xxxd1740xxx  is poorly able to control joint involvement, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are useful to this aim.
at last, we remark that as fmf attacks sometimes are related to
menstruations,  xxxd1740xxx  could be less effective and increased dosage
could be necessary at this time.
the reasons of this observed relationship are still unknown, but it has
been proposed that oestrogens, which decrease during menstruation, could
play a protective effect in the women in free periods by menses. actually,
it seems that these hormones may mimic  xxxd1740xxx  effect. they can
inhibit tubulin assembly using a binding site analogous to  xxxd1740xxx  and
can lower intercellular adhesion molecules expression. also, as  xxxd1740xxx 

manna et al.

and oestrogens are substrates of the same cytochrome in the liver, when
oestrogens levels decrease, more enzymes are available for  xxxd1740xxx 
metabolism with subsequent reduction of its blood levels [55].
 xxxd1740xxx  and male fertility
since in vitro high dosages of  xxxd1740xxx  stop mitosis inhibiting
assembly of microtubules many serious questions raised regarding
chromosomal and gonadal aberrations.
sporadic reports have signalled azoospermia in patients with gout
after chronic treatment with  xxxd1740xxx .
in consideration of young age of most fmf patients, the concern about
fertility is more relevant.
cohen et al. [56] perfomed a cytogenetic evaluation in fmf patients
receiving long-term  xxxd1740xxx . no significant differences were found
between the patients group and controls. in another controlled study, 6
fmf patients receiving long-term  xxxd1740xxx , no effect on fertility, on
levels of spermatocytes, testosterone follicle-stimulating hormone,
 xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  and prolactin showed [57], while a study performed
on 16 patients affected by fmf on  xxxd1740xxx  reported four cases of
infertility: 1 azoospermia, and 3 with normal spermogram but a
pathological hamster zona-free ova penetration test. it was supposed that
 xxxd1740xxx  may affect microtubular function of spermatocytes [58].
for this reason, some studies aimed to evaluate  xxxd1740xxx  effects on
sperm motility, were performed in vitro. the results showed that sperm
motility is significantly inhibited only after incubation with a minimal
concentration of 10 µg/ml for at least 18 hours. [59]. as plasmatic
 xxxd1740xxx  levels on therapeutic dosage is about 3 ng/ml, the amount of
 xxxd1740xxx  able to affect in vitro sperm motility is 3000 folds higher. it
appears unlikely that standard  xxxd1740xxx  treatment may inhibit sperm
motility in vivo unless the drug has a very high and special affinity for
spermatozoa.
the literature data show that the frequency of oligo or azoospermia
due to  xxxd1740xxx  depends on underlying diseases. in a study of bremner
and paulson [60], 6 healthy volunteers received  xxxd1740xxx  for 4-6 mounth
and they don’t show any effect on spermatogenesis; a study by ben chetrit
and levy showed that only 2/150 fmf patients on  xxxd1740xxx  have oligo or
azoospermia [3]; finally in a study enrolling 62 turkish men with behçet’s
disease treated with  xxxd1740xxx  oligospermia was evident in 23 patients and
azoospermia in 2 patients [61].
the current guidelines recommend males fmf patients to take
 xxxd1740xxx  as it could affect sperm motility and production but at
therapeutic doses this complication is really rare.
so data suggest that infertility and disturbed spermatogenesis not only
result from  xxxd1740xxx  use but also depend on other factors such as genetic
background or other underlying diseases (i.e. amyloidosis testicular in fmf
patients).
 xxxd1740xxx  and female fertility and pregnancy
we investigated retrospectively by questionnaire the reproductive
history of our patients in fertile-life [62]. we selected 45 patients, 30
females and 15 males, aged from 27 to 76 years, suffering from fmfrelated symptoms for 27 years on average (range 5-55 yrs). the
frequency of attacks in this group was 17.75 per annum (range 1-48 per
annum). almost all our patients have attacks characterised by fever and
peritonitis; 23 of them, before the diagnosis, underwent to at least 1
surgical operation: appendectomy, ovariectomy, cholecistectomy and
explorative laparotomy.
repeated peritonitis and surgery exposed these patients to the risk of
peritoneal adhesions that can affect reproduction by tubal obstructions.
moreover, failure to ovulate, insufficient or ineffective sperm, amyloidosis
of sexual glands and recurrent unavailability to coitus due to the acute
attacks are the main factors limiting reproduction in fmf.
our patients had 2 children on average (11 of them are not married
and have never conceived). 2 patients, 1 male and 1 female, reported
difficulties to conceive (in the male a transient oligospermia was
documented). 1 patient reported 6 abortions and, then, a pre-term delivery
(1,150 kg). a pre-term birth (29 weeks of pregnancy), occurred also in
another patient. another one reported 2 intrauterine deaths (39 weeks of
pregnancy): the reason was not ascertained. no one of the children has
malformations; cariotype was not done in anyone.
according to these findings, fmf does not seem to reduce markedly
fertility in the affected (reproductive-related problems only in 1%).

pharmacological and clinical basis of treatment of fmf

theoretically  xxxd1740xxx  could have teratogenic effects as it inhibits
mitosis, but as the diagnosis and the administration of  xxxd1740xxx  in our
patients were subsequent to the conceivement, we could not valuate the
effects of  xxxd1740xxx  on reproductive function [61,62].
the literature data based on surveys larger than ours, suggest that
 xxxd1740xxx  not only does not reduce the rate of female fertility, but may
control fmf attacks in many women who present exacerbation in
pregnancy and may reduce peritoneal adhesions preventing mechanical
causes of infertility in fmf women [3].
the actual guidelines recommend to take  xxxd1740xxx  during pregnancy
and perform an amniocentesis if it is indicated.
 xxxd1740xxx  and children
literature data suggest that breast feeding is safe as daily amount of
 xxxd1740xxx  ingested by the nursing baby is less that 1/10 of the therapeutic
dose per kilogram given to the adult [3] and it does not interfere with child
growth.
so, current guidelines recommend not to stop administration of
 xxxd1740xxx  during breast feeding and to begin treatment in children patients
as soon as possible.
 xxxd1740xxx  and amyloidosis
although fmf is a benign, self-limiting disease, it can be complicated
by amyloidosis becoming a serious disease.
amyloidosis secondary to fmf is characterised by polymerization of
serum amyloid a (saa), an acute phase protein, into amyloid fibrils and
by their deposition in multiple organs, primarily in the kidney leading to
chronic renal failure, but also in liver, spleen, heart and testes.
 xxxd1740xxx  is the drug of choice to prevent amyloidosis and, for its
effects, it is also used to prevent fibrosis in cirrhotic livers as well as in
sclerodermatous skin.
this drug slows down the rate of renal function’s deterioration and
reduces proteinuria in cases of renal failure due to amyloidosis. it has
been supposed that it interferes with amyloidosis process through 2
mechanism: indirect and direct. really  xxxd1740xxx  reduces indirectly saa
levels by controlling fmf attacks and it blocks directly the organization
and deposition of amyloid fibers [65].
 xxxd1740xxx  and tolerance
 xxxd1740xxx  treatment is complicated by frequent gastrointestinal
adverse effects such as diarrhoea and enhanced intestinal permeability
with lactose malabsorption.  xxxd1740xxx  could affect gastrointestinal
mucosa with 2 different mechanisms:
- inhibition of na+k+ exchange pump which regulates water and
electrolytes transport;
- direct mucosal damage of small and large bowel [66].
for this reason we advise our patients to follow a lactose-free diet as
lactose could worse the diarrhea  xxxd1740xxx -induced.
moreover as an eventual small intestine bacterial overgrowth could
determine severe gastrointestinal disorders which sometimes oblige
patients to discontinue  xxxd1740xxx , recently we studied if treatment of
eventual small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can improve gastrointestinal
 xxxd1740xxx  tolerance (unpublished data). we studied 25 patients with fmf
(7 m, 18 f, mean age 32.3, range 18-63) who, after starting  xxxd1740xxx  (1-3
mg/die), experienced the onset or worsening of diarrhoea unresponsive to
lactose-free diet. we scored diarrhoea by a validated diarrhoea score
based on number and consistency and imperiousness of stools. all patients
underwent to h2 glucose–lactulose breath-test for detection of small
intestinal bacterial overgrowth. in presence of bacterial overgrowth, we
treated the patients with  xxxd3118xxx  or paramomicin 1 week per month.
after three months patients were re-evaluated by h2 glucose–
lactulose breath-test and diarrhoea score. the breath tests were positive in
17/25 patients. in patients with bacterial overgrowth, basal diarrhoea score
was 3.94±1.9; instead, after eradication of bacterial overgrowth the score
became 0.41±0.7, with statistical difference (p<0.001). in all patients
treated with antibiotic therapy, h2 glucose–lactulose breath-test was
negative.
our experience suggests that an evaluation for small intestinal
bacterial overgrowth is useful in patients experimenting  xxxd1740xxx 
gastrointestinal intolerance, because antibiotic therapy can improve
 xxxd1740xxx -induced diarrhoea and so patient’s compliance. in these

121

patients, we recommend to perform h2 glucose–lactulose breath-test
because it is quick, easy, non-invasive and efficient.
according to the well known influence of simultaneous helicobacter
pylori (hp) infection on severity of gastritis and ulcers in patients on longterm therapy with aspirin or non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs
(nsaids) and the beneficial effects of eradication of hp in aspirin and
nsaids users, we usually perform urea breath test prior to start
 xxxd1740xxx  therapy. our findings suggest that hp eradication is useful to
improve  xxxd1740xxx  tolerance [66].
in summary, in order to increase compliance to  xxxd1740xxx  we
recommend:
- lactose-free diet;
- treatment of intestinal bacterial overgrowth and/or hp-infection,
assessed by breath tests.
 xxxd1740xxx  and toxicity
therapeutic oral doses in patients without hepatic or renal failure
have few side effects excepted gastrointestinal ones: diarrhea, vomiting,
cramping abdominal pain and hyperperistalsis.
rarely, at high doses bone marrow failure, skin eruptions, nettle-rash,
purple, stomatitis, intestinal bleeding can occur, meanwhile long-term
administration can result in ovarian and testicular dysfunction, steatorrhea,
and lyell syndrome [3].
neuromuscolar toxicity was reported in patients with renal failure; it
usually recovers after drug withdrawal.
the fatal dose of acute  xxxd1740xxx  poisoning is estimated at about 0,9
mg/kg.
a multi-organ failure characterized by cholera-like syndrome,
dehydration, shock, leukocytosis, alopecia, acute renal and hepatic failure,
bone marrow failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ards),
arrhythmias and heart failure, fever, coagulopathy, neuromuscular
involvement, epileptic seizures, coma and death can occur.
toxic manifestations by  xxxd1740xxx  can be divided into 3 sequential
and overlapping stages (table 3).

in the first stage, who begin within 24 hours from drug administration,
there are gastrointestinal symptoms with significant fluid loss (abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration), volume depletion and
leukocytosis.
in the second stage, 24-48 hours after drug administration, multiorgan
failure occurs (renal, respiratory and cardiac failure, pancytopenia,
metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbances, disseminated intravascular
coagulation, convulsion, coma).
if the patient survives, in the third stage there is a restitutio ad
integrum of bone marrow with rebound leukocytosis, recovery of
multiorgan injury and appearance of alopecia.
clinical management of  xxxd1740xxx  toxicity can be difficult because of
widespread involvement of various vital organs. since hemodialysis and
hemoperfusion are not effective measures because of the high volume of
distribution, an aggressive primary decontamination with gastric lavage
and activated charcoal is required as early as possible. therapy is

122

current drug targets - inflammation & allergy, 2005, vol. 4, no. 1

basically supportive: it should begin with shock-preventing measures.
symptomatic and supportive treatment may include atropine and morphine
for abdominal pain relief, and artificial respiration with oxygen to combat
respiratory distress. a recent paper reports a successful treatment by fab
fragments of antibodies anti- xxxd1740xxx . however, these antibodies have
been used only experimentally [68].
precautionary measures
 xxxd1740xxx  treatment could be performed with caution, especially in
the following cases:

severe hepatic failure and cholestasis because of reduced
metabolism;

chronic renal failure (the reduced excretion can increase the risk
of side effects especially the haematological ones);

elderly;

myasthenia gravis (possible worsening of the disease);

glucose-6-posphate dehydrogenase ( xxxd1740xxx  can trigger an
hemolytic attack).
in all these cases patients must be carefully evaluated by physicians in
order to prevent side effects.
the future: the analogues of  xxxd1740xxx 
present and future work in the design of  xxxd1740xxx  analogues and
other agents that inhibit tubulin polymerization will attempt to make agents
with reduced toxicities and a larger therapeutic window [69].
these analogues may more successfully treat diseases in which
 xxxd1740xxx  is presently used, such as familial mediterranean fever (fmf)
[70], chronic constipation [71], immunosuppresion, and several other
pathophysiological processes.
another major goal is to determine the precise interaction between
 xxxd1740xxx  and tubulin dimers. knowledge of the tubulin- xxxd1740xxx 
interactions at the atomic level may lead to the design of better drugs, with
a more favourable therapeutic index.
one insight into the molecular action of  xxxd1740xxx  has been the
determination of the biologically active conformation [72,73]. (-) xxxd1740xxx  has only one stereogenic center: carbon -7.
the designation of this carbon is s, according to the common cahningold-prelog rules. however,  xxxd1740xxx  is also asymmetric due to axial
chirality. the single bond between the a and c rings is rotationally
restricted, in a similar manner to certain substituted biphenyls (fig. 4).

fig. (5). stereoisomers of  xxxd1740xxx .

in the search for more effective agents than natural  xxxd1740xxx ,
medicinal chemists have synthesized hundreds of analogues of  xxxd1740xxx 
and  xxxd1740xxx -like compounds. analysis of these data has yielded
infomation about the optimal structural requirements for binding to tubulin
and inhibiting tubulin polymerization. the basic, although not
comprehensive, structure-activity relationships (sars) are summarized in
fig. 7, adapted from boye and brossi [73].
(+)-(ar,7r)- xxxd1740xxx  (fig. 6), the unnatural enantiomer of (-) xxxd1740xxx , is devoid of tubulin binding activity. the appropriate torsion
angle (about 53 degrees) between rings a and c is required for tubulin
binding ability. removal or demethylation of the methoxy groups
decreases potency.
on the b ring, the  xxxd63xxx  can be replaced by other alkyl amides
with retention of potency; however, the free amine has decreased
antitubulin activity. the  xxxd63xxx  can be elimated altogether, and activity
is retained. on the c ring, demethylation to the 10 -oh (i.e.  xxxd1740xxx )
destroys activity.

this restriction adds a degree of asymmetry to the molecule.
in 1933, kuhn designated this type of stereoisomerism as
atropisomerism (from greek "a" meaning not; "tropos" meaning turn) [74].
the designation of this asymmetry is "as or ar," according to the rules of
molecular asymmetry, in which the "a" stands for axial chirality [75]. in
 xxxd1740xxx , the c-c bond between the a and c rings is the chiral axis
(fig. 5).
in light of this molecular asymmetry,  xxxd1740xxx  has four
stereoisomers, as shown in fig. 5. each pair has either the r or s
configuration at c-7.
(-)-(as,7s)- xxxd1740xxx , the natural isomer, can interconvert between
the two conformational isomers ar and as, given enough energy. the
energy barrier of rotation in  xxxd1740xxx , approximately 22-24 kcal/mol
[73], is large enough to allow the synthesis and isolation of the
conformations as stereoisomers.
the research of many medicinal chemists, in particular arnold brossi,
has led to the conclusion that the counterclockwise as conformation is that
of the naturally occuring alkaloid [72,73,76-79].
shown in fig. 6 are energy-minimized models of the atropisomers of
(7s)- xxxd1740xxx  (constructed using sybyl 6.4, tripos, inc). note the very
different arrangement of the  xxxd63xxx  group in the two conformations.

fig. (6). (as, 7s)- xxxd1740xxx  (left) and (ar, 7s)- xxxd1740xxx  (right).

replacement of the 10-methoxy with sch3 or nr2 leads to increased
potency. reversal of the oxygen pattern (i.e. 9-methoxy and 10-keto)
produces isocolchicine, which is inactive. it is apparent that the tropolonic

functionality contributes to activity. this seven membered c ring can,
however, be replaced with an anisole ring, producing a bridged biphenyl,
which retains tubulin binding activity, as long as the torsion angle between
the rings a and c is acceptable (fig. 7).
in our department of biochemistry we are testing in vitro the potency
of  xxxd1740xxx  analogues by inhibiting of the chemiluminescence of
neutrophils of fmf patients [80]; our protocol in working process aims to
test gut toxicity and abnormalities of tight-junctions of enterocytes by
measuring the  xxxg2286xxx  protein (zonula occludens) on immunofluorescence
in immortalized intestinal cells (ht-29).
conclusions
familial mediterranean fever is a benign disease when treated by
 xxxd1740xxx . a long-life  xxxd1740xxx  therapy can determine a reduction of
number of fmf attacks, of their severity, preventing amyloidosis; in this
way a real improvement of the quality of life of the patients can be
achieved.
 xxxd1740xxx  is able to prevent activation of neutrophils, binding betatubulin and making  xxxg2353xxx - xxxd1740xxx  complexes; this way inhibits
assembly of microtubules and mitotic spindle formation; moreover its mode
of action includes modulation of chemokines, prostanoids production,
inhibition of neutrophil and endothelial cell adhesion molecules.
the drug is metabolised by liver and only small amounts are
recovered unchanged in the urine; so plasma half-life is prolonged only in
patients with liver or renal failure with an increase of side effects.
to improve  xxxd1740xxx  tolerance and in order to prevent
discontinuation of treatment we recommend to exclude other intestinal cofactors which can complicated therapy: as a small intestine bacterial
overgrowth assessed by h2–glucose-lactulose breath test and
helicobacter pylori infection assessed by urea-breath test. these tests
might be performed before starting therapy and if positive an antibiotic
therapy will be done; moreover a lactose free-diet can be followed to
prevent diarrhoea.
biochemical studies on  xxxd1740xxx  analogues are in progress in order
to obtain drugs with few side effects and better efficacy.
