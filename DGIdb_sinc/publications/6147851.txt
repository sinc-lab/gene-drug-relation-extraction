it has been suggested that the a agonist activity of skf
10,047 may involve a dopaminergic mechanism (1). the
purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of
the binding of a' agonists and antipsychotic drugs to the a'
(+)-[3h]skf 10,047 binding site and to the dopamine receptor.

abstract
the relationship between binding of antipsychotic drugs and o psychotomimetic opiates to binding sites
for the ar agonist ( + )-[3h]skf 10,047 (n-allylnormetazocine)
and to dopamine d2 sites was investigated. in guinea pig brain
membranes, (+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 bound to a single class of
sites with a kd of 4 x 10-8 m and a b.. of 333 fmol/mg
of protein. this binding was different from ,u, k, or 8 opiate
receptor binding. it was inhibited by opiates that produce
psychotomimetic activities but not by opiates that lack such
activities. some antipsychotic drugs inhibited (+)-[3hjskf
10,047 binding with high to moderate affinities in the following
order of potency: haloperidol > perphenazine > fluphenazine >  xxxd67xxx  >  xxxd3431xxx  > molindone _
 xxxd2956xxx  _ thioridazine -' chlorpromazine >  xxxd3433xxx . however, there were other antipsychotic drugs such
as spiperone and clozapine that showed low affinity for the
(+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding sites. affinities of antipsychotic
drugs for ( + )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding sites did not correlate
with those for [3h]spiperone (dopamine d2) sites. [3hjhaloperidol binding in whole brain membranes was also inhibited by the cr opiates pentazocine, cyclazocine, and (+)skf 10,047. in the striatum, about half of the saturable
[3h]haloperidol binding was to [3h]spiperone (d2) sites and the
other half was to sites similar to (+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding
sites.

materials and methods
(+)-[3h]skf 10,047 (34.0 ci/mmol; 1 ci = 37 gbq),
[3h]spiperone (22.8 ci/mmol), and [3h]haloperidol (14.7
ci/mmol) were from new england nuclear.
brains were dissected from 250- to 300-g male hartley
guinea pigs (charles river breeding laboratories) that were
sacrificed by decapitation. brain membranes were prepared
as described (9) and then suspended to about 1.0 mg of
protein/ml of 50 mm tris hcl buffer (ph 7.4).
in the binding assays, 1-ml aliquots of membrane preparation were incubated with unlabeled drugs, radiolabeled
ligands, and  xxxd3449xxx  in a final volume of 2 ml in 50 mm
tris'hcl (ph 7.4). samples were incubated at room temperature for 45 min, filtered through whatman gf/c glass-fiber
filters under reduced pressure, and rapidly washed three
times with ice-cold tris-hcl (5 ml). nonspecific binding of
(+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 was determined in the presence of 10
,um skf 10,047. nonspecific binding of [3h]spiperone was
determined in the presences of either 0.1 ,um ( + )-butaclamol
or 1 ,um spiperone, depending on the protocol. nonspecific
binding of [3h]haloperidol was determined in the presence of
either 0.1 ,m (+ )-butaclamol or 10 ,um haloperidol, depending on the protocol.

three types of opiate receptors have been proposed to account for the different pharmacological effects of opiates in
chronic spinal dogs (1). these receptors are named after their
prototype drugs: ,u (morphine), k (ketocyclazocine), and ca
(skf 10,047). the existence of 8 (enkephalin) receptors has
also been demonstrated in vitro (2). the "ar agonists" skf
10,047, cyclazocine, and pentazocine produced delirium in
the dog (1) and psychotomimetic effects in man that include
dysphoria and hallucinations (3-5).
because skf 10,047 and cyclazocine have been found to
bind to the phencyclidine (pcp) binding site, although with
low affinity (6), it has been suggested that the a activities of
opiates may be mediated through the pcp receptor (7).
recently, an  xxxd2070xxx -inaccessible [3h]skf 10,047 binding
site in guinea pig brain (8) and a (+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding
site in the rat central nervous system (9) have been identified. these binding sites (8, 9) have different drug selectivity
compared with the pcp binding site (6). the (+)-[3h]skf
10,047 binding site also shows different regional distribution
than the pcp binding site (9). thus, the a agonists may be
acting at the pcp receptor as well as at a separate binding
site.

results
(+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding. the a agonist (+ )-[3h]skf
10,047 bound to specific sites in the guinea pig brain membranes. a typical experiment with 2 nm ( + )-[3h]skf 10,047
gave 1400 dpm of total binding and 330 dpm of nonspecific
binding. there was no saturable or displaceable binding to
filters without brain membranes. binding was linearly proportional to the amount of membrane protein (0.3-3.0 mg)
and was time dependent. maximum binding was reached in
20 min at room temperature. the scatchard plot was linear,
suggesting a class of binding site with a kd of 4 x 10-8 m and
a bm^a of 333 fmol/mg protein (fig. 1). the (+ )-[3h]skf
10,047 binding site is highly stereoselective because (-)skf 10,047 was 1/38th as potent as (+ )-skf 10,047 (table
1).
( + )-[3h]skf 10,047 bound to a site clearly different from
the opiate ,, 8, or k sites, because the potent ,u, 8, and k
antagonist naloxone had no effect on its binding even at very
high concentrations (table 1). opiates of the benzomorphan

[3hlspiperone (d2) sites. because (+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding was carried out with whole brain membranes, [3h]spiperone binding to whole brain membranes was studied for

comparison. in this case, excess unlabeled spiperone was
used to measure nonspecific binding to allow detection of all
displaceable spiperone binding sites, which include dopamine and serotonin sites (11). although affinities in the whole
brain assay differ slightly from that found in the striatum
assay, the [3h]spiperone binding sites were different from
the ( + )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding site (table 1).
[3h]haloperidol binding. haloperidol bound to the (+)[3h]skf 10,047 binding site with high affinity (table 1).
because haloperidol is a dopamine receptor antagonist, it
was important to show that the of opiates pentazocine,
cyclazocine, and (+)-skf 10,047 can also compete with
[3hlhaloperidol for binding. as shown in fig. 2, [3h]haloperidol binding in whole brain membranes was strongly
inhibited by haloperidol and perphenazine, which had high
affinity for both dopamine and ( + )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding
sites. the cragonists pentazocine, cyclazocine, and (+ )-skf
10,047 were also effective in inhibiting [3h]haloperidol binding. the high-affinity dopamine receptor antagonists
spiperone and (+ )-butaclamol were less effective. the rank

series such as pentazocine, cyclazocine, and (+ )-skf 10,047
bound to the (+ )-['hjskf 10,047 binding site with relatively
high affinity. these opiates produce psychotomimetic effects
such as dysphoria and hallucinations (5). opiates that do not
produce apparent a- psychotomimetic effects did not bind to
the (+)-['h]skf 10,047 binding site (ref. 9; unpublished
data).
surprisingly, several chemical classes of antipsychotic
drugs bound to the oa agonist (+)-[ph]skf 10,047 binding
site with high to moderate affinities. these antipsychotic
drugs included the butyrophenone haloperidol, the benzimidazolinone  xxxd2956xxx , the tetrahydroindolone molindone,
and phenothiazines such as perphenazine, fluphenazine,  xxxd67xxx ,  xxxd3431xxx , chlorpromazine, thioridazine,
and  xxxd3433xxx  (table 1). however, there are other
antipsychotic drugs such as spiperone, (+ )-butaclamol,  xxxd3359xxx ,  xxxd2511xxx , and clozapine that bound to the (+)[3h]skf 10,047 binding site with low affinity. the stereoselective dopamine receptor blocker (+)-butaclamol was
1/34th as potent as (- )-butaclamol in inhibiting ( + )-[3h]skf
10,047 binding, and apomorphine and dopamine had no effect. unlike the known effect of na+ on at opiate binding
(10), (+)-[3h]skf 10,047 binding was not affected by the
presence of 100 mm nacl (unpublished data). its displacement by drugs was also not affected by nacl (table 1).
[31h]spiperone binding. to compare (+ )-[3h]skf 10,047
binding with dopamine receptor binding,  xxxg656xxx  binding studies were performed using striatum membranes and [3h]spiperone. nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 0.1 ,um (+)-butaclamol. the
opiates (+)-skf 10,047 and cyclazocine had very low affinity for [3h]spiperone (d2) binding sites, whereas the antipsychotics displaced [3h]spiperone with high to moderate
affinity (table 1). clearly, the binding of the drugs to the (+ )[3hiskf 10,047 binding site is different than the binding to
o-

inhibiting [3h]haloperidol binding (ic50 > 50,um), suggesting
[3h]haloperidol bound mostly to sites other than serotonin-binding sites. the results were similar when membranes prepared from brain from which the dopamine receptor-rich striatum region had been removed were used in the
[3h]haloperidol binding studies. thus, the majority of sites
labeled by [3h]haloperidol in guinea pig brain membranes
that

similar to the ( + )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding site.
to further compare the effects of antipsychotic drugs and
o opiates on dopamine d2 sites and (+ )-[3h]skf 10,047
binding sites, [3h]haloperidol binding in striatum was studied. the dopamine receptor blockers spiperone,  xxxd2511xxx ,
and (+ )-butaclamol showed biphasic displacement curves in
the binding of [3h]haloperidol to striatal membranes (fig. 3).
at a concentration (0.1,um) commonly used to block specific
binding to dopamine receptors, (+ )-butaclamol blocked only
about 50% of total binding. perphenazine and fluphenazine,
which have similar affinity for both the [3h]spiperone (d2)
site and the (+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding site, did not show
biphasic displacement. the o, opiates also showed biphasic
were

displacement.

in the next experiment, binding of [3h]haloperidol to striatum was carried out in the presence of 0.1 ,um (+)-butaclamol to block dopamine d2 binding, to investigate
whether the c opiates were binding to sites different from the

dopamine d2 sites. after dopamine d2 sites were blocked,
perphenazine, (-)-butaclamol, and the a opiates pentazocine, cyclazocine, and (+)-skf 10,047 were effective in
inhibiting [3h]haloperidol binding (fig. 4). (- )-skf 10,047
was much less effective than (+)-skf 10,047, which is
consistent with binding to (+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding sites

in brain membranes.

discussion
racemic skf 10,047 produces analgesia and psychotomimetic subjective effects in man (3) and delirium in dogs (1,
12). the analgesic activity of skf 10,047 resides primarily in
its (- )-isomer (13). (- )-skf 10,047 binds with high affinity
to both at and k receptors and produces predominantly k
agonist activity in /3-funaltrexamine-treated guinea pig ileum

8, or k opioids such as morphine, naloxone, the enkephalins,
and the dynorphins. similar binding sites have been identified in guinea pig brain by using racemic [3h]skf 10,047 in
the presence of excess unlabeled  xxxd2070xxx  (8) and in the rat
central nervous system by using racemic [3h]ethylketocyclazocine in the presence of excess unlabeled naloxone or
(+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 (9). the regional distribution of the (+ )[3h]skf 10,047 binding site is different from that of the g, 8,
and pcp receptors in the rat brain (9) and that of the ,u, 8, and
k receptors in guinea pig brain (unpublished data).
interestingly, a number of antipsychotic drugs representing several chemical classes were found to bind to the (+ )[3h]skf 10,047 binding site with high to moderate affinity.
these drugs include a butyrophenone, a benzimidazolinone,
a tetrahydroindolone, and all the phenothiazine antipsychotics tested. the rank order of binding potency is haloperidol
> perphenazine > fluphenazine >  xxxd67xxx  >  xxxd3431xxx  > molindone '  xxxd2956xxx  ' thioridazine '
chlorpromazine -  xxxd3433xxx . however, there are other
antipsychotic drugs such as spiperone,  xxxd3359xxx ,  xxxd2511xxx ,
and clozapine that had much lower affinity for the (+)[3h]skf 10,047 binding site. so, there is no direct relationship between the affinity of these antipsychotic drugs for this
site and for the [3h]spiperone binding site. the affinity of the
antipsychotic drugs for the [3h]spiperone (d2) site in guinea
pig brain membranes was similar to literature values reported? for the rat (14).
binding studies with [3h]haloperidol to membranes prepared from whole guinea pig brain showed that the order of
drug potency for opiates and antipsychotics in inhibiting
[3h]haloperidol binding is similar to that in inhibiting (+)[3h]skf 10,047 binding. in the striatum, which is rich in
dopamine receptors, about half of the displaceable
[3h]haloperidol binding could be blocked by 0.1 aum (+)butaclamol and therefore was supposedly to the dopamine
d2 site. the other half of the displaceable [3h]haloperidol
binding to striatal membranes could not be blocked by 0.1
,um (+ )-butaclamol and thus is not to the dopamine d2 site.
these sites are generally referred to as nonspecific but saturable sites (14). interestingly, the antipsychotic drug perphenazine and the oc opiate agonists (+ )-skf 10,047,
cyclazocine, and pentazocine were effective in inhibiting 0.1
klm (+)-butaclamol-nondisplaceable saturable [3h]haloperidol binding. furthermore, the order of potency and stereo-

selectivity in inhibiting this binding is similar to the order of
potency and stereoselectivity in inhibiting o- (+)-[3h]skf
10,047 binding. therefore, the results suggest that the 0.1
am (+)-butaclamol-nondisplaceable saturable [3hjhaloperidol binding sites and the (+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding sites
are similar if not identical.
the findings that the majority of sites in the brain that are
labeled by [3h]haloperidol are similar to the (+ )-[3h]skf
10,047 binding site and that some psychotomimetics as well
as a number of antipsychotic drugs bind to these sites raise
important questions. are the (+ )-[3h]skf 10,047 binding
sites pharmacologically relevant? although a definitive answer is not possible, the characteristics of this binding site
are consistent with the hypothesis that it is pharmacologically relevant. these characteristics include a protein moiety
(unpublished data), stereoselectivity for ligands, large
number of sites showing regional distribution in brain, binding of opiates that produce dysphoric or psychotomimetic
effects, and binding of several chemical classes of antipsychotic drugs but not binding of known neurotransmitters or
selective ligands for other known receptors (ref. 9; unpub-

lished data). are there endogenous "psychotomimetic"
ligands for this binding site? such ligands have not been
found. various endogenous psychoactive compounds have
been identified. for example, a-endorphin has been reported
to have some activity common with amphetamine and destyr-y-endorphin has been reported to have neuroleptic activity (15). these two neuropeptides do not appear to act
through this binding site, because their affinity is very low.
with the present selective binding assay, it should be possible to determine whether endogenous ligands for this binding site exist. some antipsychotic drugs may act therapeutically by antagonizing both this site and dopamine receptors
whereas others may be specifically antagonizing dopamine
receptors only.
