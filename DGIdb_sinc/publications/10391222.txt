thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia with diabetes and
deafness1 ( xxxg2100xxx ; mim 249270) is an autosomal recessive disease thought to be due to a defect in thiamine (vitamin b1)
transport2,3. pharmacological doses of thiamine correct the
anaemia, and in some cases improve the diabetes, although
progressive sensorineural deafness is irreversible4. previous
studies localized the  xxxg2100xxx  gene to a 4-cm region on chromosome 1q23.3 (ref. 5), and fine-mapping has recently narrowed
that region further6,7. we have previously demonstrated that
fibroblasts from people with  xxxg2100xxx  lack high-affinity thiamine
transport8. expression of a gene encoding a known yeast thiamine transporter, thi10 (refs 8−10), in  xxxg2100xxx  mutant cells prevents apoptotic cell death in thiamine-depleted medium. on
the basis of these studies, we hypothesized that a defective thiamine transporter causes  xxxg2100xxx . we undertook a candidate
gene approach to identify putative thiamine transporters in the
1q23.3 critical region. here we present evidence that the gene
 xxxg2100xxx  (for solute carrier family 19 (thiamine transporter),
member 2) encodes the first known mammalian thiamine transporter, which we designate thiamine transporter-1 ( xxxg2100xxx ).

we first sought mammalian homologues of yeast thi10
(refs 9–10). blast searches11 revealed two human expressed
sequence tags (ests), image clone 133203 and est 186381,
with some similarity to thi10. neither, however, mapped to
chromosome 1q23.3 by southern analysis of yeast artificial chromosomes spanning the region (data not shown). we then scrutinized other potential candidates in the narrowed critical region7.
only eight known or potential genes lie between d1s1569 and
d1s2851. they include a pseudogene related to mitochondrial
mtatp8 (formerly atp8), two uncharacterized genes, a putative
final exon encoding bzip transcription factor jem-1, a new gene
( xxxg2100xxx ) similar to slc19a1 (encoding methotrexate/reduced
folate carrier protein12,13, rfc-1), and genes encoding e-, p- and
l-selectins and  xxxg749xxx . sequencing of p1 artificial
chromosome (pac) 206d15 by the sanger centre
(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/) localized  xxxg2100xxx  to this pac. furthermore, labay et al. mapped pac 206d15 to the narrowed
 xxxg2100xxx -critical region7. as  xxxg2100xxx  encodes a multi-transmembrane protein with similarity to another vitamin transporter, we
hypothesized that it is the gene whose mutation results in  xxxg2100xxx .
our strategy was to isolate and characterize the cdna of this
predicted gene to determine whether it is mutated in  xxxg2100xxx 
patients and establish whether it encodes a thiamine transporter.
although the annotation of pac 206d15 provided by the sanger
centre described the genomic structure of  xxxg2100xxx  (6 exons >20
kb), the predicted message was incomplete at the 5´ end. prelimi-

nary northern-blot analysis using ests of  xxxg2100xxx  as probes
revealed skeletal muscle as a source of message. using image
clone 648356 as probe, we isolated full-length cdna encoding
 xxxg2100xxx  from a human skeletal muscle cdna library. we found
that 3 skeletal muscle cdna clones contained both the most 5´ predicted exon in the pac sequence (nt 1,308−1,424 of 206d15) and
the most 3´ predicted exon (nt 21,010−21,138). all clones isolated
from the library screen extended further 5´ than the annotations of
pac 206d15 predicted, and included a likely initiator codon. the
clone extending the most 5´ began at nt 1,061 of pac 206d15. to
determine the true transcriptional start site for  xxxg2100xxx  cdna,
we analysed total rna from wild-type human fibroblasts by
primer extension. a transcriptional start site was found at nt 1,111
of pac 206d15 (fig. 1). we predicted that the initiator methionine
codon is encoded by the atg at nt 1,221 of pac 206d15, because

fig. 2 relationship of  xxxg2100xxx  to similar proteins.
a, predicted amino acid sequence of  xxxg2100xxx  and
clustalw (http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) alignment with homologues human rfc-1 and c. elegans
cael-1. the consensus sequence is given below the
alignment. capital letters correspond to residues conserved in all three proteins, small letters indicate conservation in two. numbering corresponds to  xxxg2100xxx .
asterisks indicate stop codons in  xxxg2100xxx  and cael-1.
the last 113 aa of human rfc-1 (not shown) are not
homologous. shaded boxes indicate the putative
membrane-spanning regions as determined by phdtopology14. a prosite search17 of the  xxxg2100xxx 
sequence found the following sites: predicted n-linked
glycosylation sites at aa 63−66 and 314−317 (underlined); possible protein kinase c sites (aa 8−10, 22−24
and 291−293; italics); a potential n-myristoylation site
(box) at aa 235−240; and a predicted g-protein receptor site (bold; aa 407−423). several computer modelling programs predict the amino terminus to be
cytoplasmic (for example, http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/predictprotein and http://www.ch.embnet.
org/software/tmpred_form.html). b, phylogenetic
comparison of  xxxg2100xxx  with mammalian rfc-1 homologues (mouse, rat, crigr, human) and c. elegans homologues cael-1, cael-2 and cael-3. pileup ( xxxg873xxx ) was
used to depict the overall similarities as a dendogram.

stop codons are found in all 3 reading frames upstream, the next
atg in the orf is 113 amino acids downstream, and by comparison with related proteins, the predicted start allows a similar peptide structure (fig. 2). the cloned cdna encodes a putative
protein of 497 amino acids, of predicted molecular mass 55 kd.
phdtopology14 predicts that the encoded protein,  xxxg2100xxx , has 11
membrane-spanning regions (fig. 2a). blastp (ref. 11) comparison of  xxxg2100xxx  with genbank protein databases revealed several
related proteins. the rfc-1 proteins of human, mouse, rat and
chinese hamster are all 40−42% identical (by pair-wise bestfit
analysis), and 3 caenorhabditis elegans predicted proteins of
unknown function are 36−40% identical by similar analysis. phylogenetic analysis comparing the known mammalian reduced
folate carriers,  xxxg2100xxx  and the three related c. elegans proteins

a

(designated cael-1, cael-2 and cael-3; fig. 2b) indicates that
cael-1 is nearly as similar to  xxxg2100xxx  as is human rfc-1.
clustalw alignment (http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) of
 xxxg2100xxx , human rfc-1 and cael-1 shows this similarity
(fig. 2a). the similarity in hydropathy and overall structure
strengthens the hypothesis that  xxxg2100xxx  might function as a transporter. although similar,  xxxg2100xxx  is distinct from human rfc-1,
most notably at both ends. the significant similarity between
 xxxg2100xxx  and cael-1 (40% identity) indicates that the c. elegans
protein may be an orthologue of  xxxg2100xxx .
we examined  xxxg2100xxx  mrna expression in normal tissues
and a  xxxg2100xxx  kindred. we established the tissue distribution and
relative abundance of candidate gene mrna using a human
multi-tissue northern blot probed with  xxxg2100xxx  cdna (fig. 3a).

blot of total rna from  xxxg2100xxx  patient fibroblasts

longer than the largest cdna isolated (3.6 kb). the
blot was subsequently hybridized to a  xxxg53xxx  control probe. quantitative phosphorimager analysis
of the fibroblast northern (with imagequant software) indicates that the mutant  xxxg2100xxx  message
(lanes 1,2) is slightly lower (60% that of heterozygote and wild-type message (lanes 3−5)) when corrected for  xxxg53xxx  levels. the significance of this
finding in light of the mutations found is uncertain, and may represent decreased mrna stability.

fig. 4 mutations in  xxxg2100xxx  in two
affected families. exons from wild-type,
obligate heterozygote and  xxxg2100xxx  patient
dna of an alaskan kindred4 and a turkish−
kurdish kindred residing in switzerland
(d.f.s., unpublished data) were amplified
from genomic dna and directly sequenced. the sequence of each genotype
(+/+, +/– and –/–) in the mutation area is
listed below the histogram, and the resulting amino acid sequence for the patient
dna (–/–) is shown. the nucleotides
deleted in the patient dna are underlined
in wild-type sequence. a, in the alaskan
kindred, a single base (thymine) at position
885 of the cdna sequence (exon 3, nt
16,878 of pac206d15) is deleted in the
homozygous patient (–/–). this results in a
frameshift and the introduction of a premature stop codon (sequence shown
beneath the histograms). the reading
frame is lost in the heterozygote at position 885. b, in the swiss−kurdish kindred,
gt at position 1,147−1,148 of the cdna
sequence (exon 4, nt 18,267−18,268 of pac
206d15) is deleted in the homozygous
patient (–/–), and the reading frame is lost
in the heterozygote at position 1,148. this
deletion also results in a frameshift and an
immediate stop codon.

the 3.9-kb mrna was widely expressed, with the highest levels
found in skeletal muscle, followed by heart, placenta, kidney,
liver, and other tissues. we next looked for gross alterations in
 xxxg2100xxx  mrna in fibroblasts from an alaskan  xxxg2100xxx  kindred4.
a northern blot of total rna from fibroblasts of an unaffected
relative, two obligate heterozygotes and two  xxxg2100xxx  patients
(fig. 3b) revealed no difference in size of the rna between the
different samples, indicating that the defect was not due to a large
insertion, deletion or splicing defect.
we used the predicted exon structure from sanger centre
annotation of pac 206d15 to design sequencing primers for
mutation scanning in exons of  xxxg2100xxx  in two unrelated consanguineous kindreds4 (d.f.s., unpublished data). distinct
frameshift mutations with early stop codons were found in
 xxxg2100xxx  patients in both families (fig. 4). six additional mutations
have now been identified by labay et al.7, who have used a positional cloning approach to identify  xxxg2100xxx .

to test the hypothesis that  xxxg2100xxx  encodes a functional thiamine transporter,  xxxg2100xxx  was cloned into mammalian expression vectors and transiently expressed in 293t cells and
fibroblasts from  xxxg2100xxx  patients. we determined the ability of the
cells expressing  xxxg2100xxx  to take up 3h-thiamine from the
medium at nanomolar concentrations as described8. slc19a2transfected 293t cells took up thiamine at a fivefold greater rate
than vector-only control (fig. 5a). saturable uptake, assessed by
incubation with or without excess unlabelled thiamine, is very
low in  xxxg2100xxx  mutant fibroblasts8. transfection of  xxxg2100xxx  mutant
fibroblasts with a  xxxg2100xxx  sense construct, but not with an antisense construct, resulted in restoration of saturable 3h-thiamine
uptake (fig. 5b). these results demonstrate that the gene defective in  xxxg2100xxx  syndrome encodes a functional thiamine transporter,  xxxg2100xxx .
considering the predicted absence of  xxxg2100xxx  function in
 xxxg2100xxx  patients, we speculate that a secondary thiamine trans-

b
fig. 5  xxxg2100xxx  directs high-affinity thiamine uptake. 3h-thiamine was
incubated with 293t cells (a) or mutant fibroblasts (b) from  xxxg2100xxx 
patient 4 of the alaskan kindred transfected with the constructs
shown. the thiamine concentration was 7 nm, well below the 400 nm
apparent km for this transporter8. specific uptake was calculated as
cell-associated radioactivity after a 30-min incubation, correcting for
uptake not inhibitable by 3 µm (400-fold excess) unlabelled thiamine.
because transfection efficiency, and therefore control uptake, varied
among duplicate trials, values for specific uptake are presented as
percentage of control in 293t cells (a), pef-1alpha vector alone
(100%=0.017 pmol/106 cells/30 min), and in  xxxg2100xxx  mutant fibroblasts
(b), pmt2- xxxg2100xxx  antisense (as; 100%=0.0062 pmol/106 cells/30 min).
controls are the means of duplicate experiments. the difference in
specific uptake was highly significant for pef-vector alone versus pefthtr-1 (a; p<0.0001) and pmt2-thtr-antisense versus pmt2-thtr-sense
(b; p=0.0053). the means of two experiments for each cell type done
in triplicate (a) or duplicate (b) are presented. error bars represent
standard deviations.

port process8 (either a second transporter or low-affinity
uptake) acts to allow sufficient thiamine uptake to prevent the
metabolic condition of severe thiamine deficiency8 (‘beriberi’).
the characteristic phenotype of  xxxg2100xxx  patients untreated with
high doses of vitamin b1 suggests a critical role for  xxxg2100xxx  in
several physiologic processes: namely, hearing, haematopoiesis
and glucose homeostasis.

methods
cloning of  xxxg2100xxx  cdna. we screened 3.2×105 clones of a human skeletal muscle cdna library (clontech) with image clone 648356 (ref. 15).
this est contained portions of the fourth exon through the 3´ utr of the
predicted  xxxg2100xxx  cdna (no ests in the current database represented the
predicted 5´ end of the gene). we identified 3 individual clones that contained both the most 5´ predicted exon in the pac sequence (nt 1,308−
1,424 of pac 206d15) and the most 3´ predicted exon (nt 21,010−21,138).
we subcloned each cdna into pbluescript and sequenced the ends. additional internal sequencing confirmed the predicted exon junctions. the
largest cdna isolated in the library screen was approximately 3.6 kb,
extending to position 23,074 in pac 206d15. this was similar to the predicted size determined from the assembly of putative exons from the
genomic sequence of pac 206d15. we carried out primer extension15
using total rna (25 µg) from wild-type fibroblasts and an oligonucleotide
primer at nt 1,137−1,160 of pac 206d15. the reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 45 °c and products run on a 6% acrylamide gel. we
exposed the gel to biomax ms film (kodak) overnight. for transfection
studies, we cloned  xxxg2100xxx  cdna into the ecor1 sites of two mammalian
expression vectors, pef1alpha-neo (a gift from s. orkin) and pmt2 (ref. 18).
analysis of  xxxg2100xxx  cdna sequence. blastp (ref. 11) was used to compare  xxxg2100xxx  sequence with the genbank protein database. we determined the predicted transmembrane structures using phdtopology14
(http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/predictprotein) and compared the membrane structure with those predicted for human rfc-1 and cael-1. multiple sequence alignment was performed with clustalw (http://www2.
ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/), whereas phylogenetic analysis with related proteins
(mouse rfc-1, rat rfc-1, crigr (chinese hamster) rfc-1, cael-1, cael-2
and cael-3) was accomplished with pileup ( xxxg873xxx ).
northern analysis. we probed a human multi-tissue northern blot (clontech) with image clone 648356 to assess tissue distribution before cdna
cloning. the blot was exposed to biomax ms film (kodak) for 36 h at –80
°c. the blot was then stripped and re-probed, using a probe for the betaactin gene as a control. total rna was extracted from fibroblasts from
 xxxg2100xxx  individuals, obligate heterozygotes and wild-type controls using
rnazol (leedo laboratories), separated by formaldehyde agarose gel
electrophoresis and blotted onto hybond-n+ membrane (amersham).
image clone 648356 was again used as a probe, followed by one that

transfection and uptake studies. we plated 5×106 293t cells (a sv40transformed human embryonic kidney cell line) in thiamine-minus medium (alpha-mem, 15% dialysed fcs, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% lglutamine) the day before transfection. we transfected cells by calcium
phosphate with either pef1alpha-neo vector alone or pef1alpha-neo/ xxxg2100xxx  (5

(7 nm) or 3h-thiamine (7 nm) plus unlabelled thiamine (3 µm). they
were assayed for their ability to take up 3h-thiamine as described8. we
transfected fibroblasts from  xxxg2100xxx  patients with sense and antisense constructs of  xxxg2100xxx  cloned into the mammalian expression vector pmt2.
