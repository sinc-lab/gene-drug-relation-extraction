abstract

purpose: resistance is commonly acquired in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal
tumor who are treated with  xxxd2333xxx , often due to the development of secondary mutations in the kit kinase domain. we sought to investigate the efficacy of second-line tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib,  xxxd1815xxx , and  xxxd2724xxx , against the commonly observed
imatinib-resistant kit mutations (kit v654a, kit t670i, kit d820y, and kit n822k) expressed in the
ba/f3 cellular system.
experimental design: in vitro drug screening of stable ba/f3 kit mutants recapitulating the
genotype of imatinib-resistant patients harboring primary and secondary kit mutations was
investigated. comparison was made to imatinib-sensitive ba/f3 kit mutant cells as well as
ba/f3 cells expressing only secondary kit mutations. the efficacy of drug treatment was evaluated by proliferation and apoptosis assays, in addition to biochemical inhibition of kitactivation.
results: sorafenib was potent against all imatinib-resistant ba/f3 kit double mutants tested,
including the gatekeeper secondary mutation kitwk557-8del/t670i, which was resistant to other
kinase inhibitors. although all three drugs tested decreased cell proliferation and inhibited kit
activation against exon 13 (kitv560del/v654a ) and exon 17 (kitv559d/d820y ) double mutants,
 xxxd2724xxx  did so at lower concentrations.
conclusions: our results emphasize the need for tailored salvage therapy in imatinib-refractory
gastrointestinal stromal tumors according to individual molecular mechanisms of resistance. the
ba/f3 kitwk557-8del/t670i cells were sensitive only to sorafenib inhibition, whereas  xxxd2724xxx  was
more potent on imatinib-resistant kitv560del/v654a and kitv559d/d820y mutant cells than  xxxd1815xxx 
and sorafenib.

gastrointestinal stromal tumor (gist) is the most common
mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. constitutive
activation through oncogenic mutations of the kit or plateletderived growth factor receptor a ( xxxg1709xxx ) receptor tyrosine
kinase plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gists
(1, 2).  xxxd2333xxx  (gleevec, novartis pharmaceuticals)
potently inhibits bcr-abl,  xxxg1709xxx ,  xxxg1710xxx , and kit and
has been the frontline therapy in chronic myelogenous
leukemia and advanced gists since its regulatory approval.

 xxxd2333xxx  achieves a clinical response in f80% of
gist patients (3, 4), which is directly dependent on the
presence and genomic location of kit/ xxxg1709xxx  mutations.
patients with kit exon 11 mutations have a partial response
rate of 84%, whereas tumors with an exon 9 mutation or wildtype kit are less likely to respond (5, 6). although imatinib has
improved survival in gist, complete response is rare. furthermore, it is now clear that the majority of patients who initially
benefit from  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors eventually become
resistant, with a median time to progression on imatinib
mesylate of 2 years (7). after an initial response, 46% to 67% of
patients will develop imatinib resistance through acquisition of
a secondary mutation in the kit kinase domain (8 – 10). these
secondary mutations tend to be single amino acid substitutions
in exon 17 most often, but they also occur in exons 13 and 14
(8). the mechanism for the development of second-site kit
mutations remains unclear, but resistant patients with identifiable secondary mutations have been treated with imatinib
longer than resistant patients lacking secondary mutations
(median, 27 versus 14.5 months; ref. 8). these findings suggest
that clonal selection of existing mutations before imatinib
therapy is unlikely to explain acquired resistance. the frequency
of secondary mutations is also determined by the location of
the primary kit mutations, with gists harboring kit exon 11
mutations more commonly becoming imatinib resistant due to

second-line agents in imatinib-resistant kit mutants

acquisition of secondary mutations compared with kit exon
9 – mutated gist. one possible explanation for this difference
is that kit exon 9 mutant gists are able to use alternative
mechanisms, whereas kit exon 11 gists are more dependent
on kit signaling (10). polyclonal acquired resistance as a result
of multiple secondary kit mutations in geographically separate
metastases has been reported in up to 18% (10 – 12).
consistent with secondary clonal evolution, the primary
mutation is always detectable in each tumor and there is never
more than one new mutation in the same sample. these
findings suggest that long-term imatinib therapy leads to clonal
selection of resistant tumor subclones. rna interference kit
knockdown experiments revealed that imatinib-resistant cell
lines carrying secondary kit mutations remain dependent on
kit signaling for growth and survival (10). alternative
mechanisms, such as low-level genomic kit amplifications,
play only a minor role in imatinib resistance in gist (8, 11).
the initial success of imatinib as a targeted therapeutic drug
and the better understanding of drug-kinase interaction based
on crystallographic structure have led to the development of
several novel small-molecule compounds that have a variable
spectrum of kinase inhibition. as the median survival is only
15 months once imatinib resistance develops (13), it is important to validate novel therapeutic strategies within the specific
kit/ xxxg1709xxx  genotype that confer imatinib resistance. some
of the alternative agents to imatinib being tested in clinical
trials include  xxxd2724xxx , sorafenib, and  xxxd1815xxx . the initial
results of these trials are still being analyzed, but the efficacy of
these drugs might not be clear due to the heterogeneity of
imatinib-resistant patients enrolled. thus, a more systematic
in vitro approach of validating individual drug efficacy vis-à-vis
specific resistant genotypes might better guide therapy and
clinical trial design. these small molecules function as kit
kinase inhibitors, and some in addition inhibit other downstream targets.  xxxd2724xxx  (amn107) was designed based on
the crystal structures of imatinib and the abl kinase complex.
this multitargeted kinase inhibitor features higher affinity to
the atp-binding site of abl kinase to override imatinib resistance caused by bcr-abl mutation (14). in addition,  xxxd2724xxx 
selectively inhibits the kit and pdgfr tyrosine kinases (14).
another small molecule, which showed great promise in the
chronic myelogenous leukemia patients that are resistant or
intolerant to imatinib, is  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ).  xxxd1815xxx  is
an atp competitor, with dual src/abl activity, which inhibits
most bcr-abl mutants by binding to the active form of the
kinase (15). furthermore,  xxxd1815xxx  potently inhibits kit, both
wild-type and juxtamembrane domain mutant kit (16).
sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx , nexavar) is a novel biaryl urea
compound that was initially developed as a specific inhibitor of
serine-threonine kinase raf. in addition, sorafenib has activity
with few receptor tyrosine kinases, including  xxxg2413xxx  receptor-2,  xxxg2413xxx 
receptor-3,  xxxg1710xxx , and kit (17). sorafenib has shown broadspectrum, dose-dependent antitumor activity against xenograft
models of human colon, lung, breast, ovarian, and pancreatic
cancers and melanoma (18).
based on our hypothesis that individual kit mutant
oncoproteins will affect on drug sensitivity, we investigated
the efficacy of sorafenib,  xxxd2724xxx , and  xxxd1815xxx  on ba/f3 cells
expressing various kit mutants, which recapitulate imatinibresistant gist genotypes.

materials and methods
ba/f3 kit mutant transformants. kit mutations recapitulating the
genotype found in four imatinib-resistant gist patients were introduced
by site-directed mutagenesis pcr, using quikchange ii xl site-directed
mutagenesis kit (qiagen, inc.), on a retroviral expression vector
containing wild-type human kit cdna (gnnk isoform), pmscvwtkit-ires-gfp (a generous gift from dr. gary gilliland, harvard
medical school, boston, ma). kit double mutant isoforms were
generated hosting a primary kit exon 11 mutation and a secondary mutation in kit exon 13, 14, or 17 as follows: kit v560del/v654a,
kit wk557-8del/t670i, kit v559d/d820y , and kit v560del/n822k . single kit
mutants carrying the secondary mutation alone were also generated for
comparison, including kit t670i, kit d820y , and kit n822k . the imatinibsensitive exon 11 single mutants kit v559d and kit wk557-8del as well as
the imatinib less-sensitive exon 9 kit ay502-3ins were used as controls.
the parental cell line ba/f3 (german collection of microorganisms
and cell cultures, human and animal cell cultures collection) is an
 xxxg1177xxx  ( xxxg1177xxx )-dependent murine pro-b-cell line lacking intrinsic
kit expression. retroviral vector plasmids containing mutant kit
cdna isoforms (25 ag of each construct) and the hygromycin selection
marker were cotransfected into ba/f3 cells at the ratio of 25:1 via
electroporation using genepulser (bio-rad). stable transfectants were
established by triple selection. the electroporated cells were first
selected with hygromycin for 7 to 10 days, and the remaining cells were
sorted according to green fluorescent protein fluorescence. the selected
green fluorescent protein – positive cells were grown for 2 weeks in the
presence of hygromycin, and finally, cells were grown in the absence of
 xxxg1177xxx . the cell surface kit expression was confirmed by flow cytometry
using pe-conjugated anti- xxxg1279xxx  (bd biosciences) antibody. total kit
expression was confirmed by western blotting using anti-kit (oncogene) antibody.
cell proliferation assays. to determine the growth inhibition drug
effects, ba/f3 kit mutant cells were starved from growth factor for 4 h.
fifteen minutes before drug administration, growth factors were added:
10 ng/ml  xxxg1177xxx  for the  xxxg1177xxx  – dependent ba/f3 kit mutants (kit d820y
and kitv560del/n822k ) and 20 ng/ml kl for the remaining kl-dependent
ba/f3 kit mutant isoforms. cells were incubated with 10 to 10,000
nmol/l of sorafenib,  xxxd1815xxx ,  xxxd2724xxx , and imatinib at 37jc for
48 h. the concentrations of drug used in these studies are in line with
the concentrations achievable in human plasma based on pharmacokinetic studies of the kinase inhibitors.  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd2724xxx  were
synthesized and kindly provided by dr. bayard clarkson (sloankettering institute, new york, ny). imatinib and sorafenib were
purchased commercially. bromodeoxyuridine was then added and
incubated for 6 h before harvesting. cells were fixed and stained using
the standard protocol of the brdu-apc kit (pharmingen). bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was determined by flow cytometry. all
experiments were done in triplicate. a minimum of 2  105 events
was acquired and the data were analyzed using flowjo software (version
5.7.2). cell growth inhibition curves and ic50 values were plotted and
calculated using graphpad prism software, version 4.03.
apoptosis assays. induction of apoptosis on ba/f3 kit transformants was evaluated by flow cytometry using the  xxxg166xxx -pe
apoptosis detection kit (pharmingen) in duplicate experiments. cells
at a density of 1  106, activated with kl, were cultured in 24-well
plates and starved from growth factors for 4 h before drug delivery.
fifteen minutes before adding the drug, growth factors were added.
after drug incubation for 48 h using the concentrations indicated
above, cells were harvested and stained with anti- xxxg166xxx -pe
antibody using the provider’s protocol. a minimum of 10,000 events
was analyzed by facscan (becton dickinson) within an hour after
staining. the data and results were analyzed by flowjo.
immunoprecipitation and western blotting. the ba/f3 cells expressing single and double kit mutants were treated with the indicated doses
of each drug. cells were starved from serum and growth factors for 2 h,

protein extraction. whole-cell lysate (200 ag) was incubated with 2 ag
of anti-kit antibody (assay designs, inc.) for an hour, and then the
mixture was incubated with magna beads (pierce biotechnology)
overnight at 4jc. the beads were washed and isolated using a magnetic

rized in table 1.  xxxd1815xxx  induced apoptosis in >20% of cells
 xxxd1891xxx  nmol/l, whereas the other drugs induced programmed
cell death at 100 nmol/l. the biochemical assays showed
consistent kitv559d phosphorylation inhibition by all four
inhibitors tested, with  xxxd1815xxx  being the most potent. kit
kinase activity was distinctly inhibited using <10 nmol/l
 xxxd1815xxx , whereas imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx , and sorafenib showed
the same results at 100 nmol/l.
similarly, the growth of kitwk557-8del cells was inhibited by
 xxxd1815xxx  with an ic50 of 58 nmol/l, whereas imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx , and sorafenib had an ic50 of 460, 83, and 211 nmol/l,
respectively (fig. 1). furthermore, significant induction of
apoptosis was noted at 100 nmol/l of  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd2724xxx .
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibited the imatinib less-sensitive ba/f3
kitay502-3ins with an ic50 of 74 nmol/l, whereas imatinib,
 xxxd2724xxx , and sorafenib had an ic50 of 509, 671, and 400 nmol/l,
respectively.  xxxd1815xxx  induced significant (>90%) programmed
cell death of kit ay502-3ins cells at 100 nmol/l, whereas  xxxd2724xxx 
induced f65% and sorafenib induced 35% of programmed cell
death at the same concentration. imatinib did not induce overt
apoptosis until 1,000 nmol/l. in keeping with the cell
proliferation inhibition and apoptosis results, imatinib did
not inhibit kit phosphorylation at 100 nmol/l but showed
distinct inhibition on kit activity at 1,000 nmol/l.

to test existing second-line inhibitors on imatinib-resistant
kit oncoproteins, we developed stable ba/f3 transfectants
expressing single and double mutant isoforms and selected by
 xxxg1177xxx  – independent growth. eight of the 10 kit mutant forms
induced transformation by conferring factor-independent
growth to ba/f3 cells. kitd820y and kitv560del/n822k ba/f3
mutants did not achieve  xxxg1177xxx  independence. ba/f3 transfectants expressing double kit mutants, kit v560del/v654a,
kit wk557-8del/t670i, kit v559d/d820y , and kit v560del/n822k , and
single kit mutant isoforms, kit t670i and kit n822k , were
tested with sorafenib,  xxxd1815xxx ,  xxxd2724xxx , and imatinib. the
efficacy of each drug was compared with imatinib-sensitive
kit juxtamembrane and extracellular domain mutations, ba/
f3 kit v559d, kit wk557-8del , and kit ay502-3ins .
 xxxd1815xxx  is more potent than other kinase inhibitors on
imatinib-sensitive ba/f3 kit mutants. the in vitro cell proliferation assay showed that  xxxd1815xxx  inhibited cell growth of

only drug that inhibited the cell proliferation of the ba/f3
kitwk557-8del/t670i transfectant with an ic50 of 1,063 nmol/l
and induction of significant programmed cell death between
1,000 and 5,000 nmol/l (fig. 2). sorafenib also showed
distinct inhibition of the kinase activity of the kl-dependent
double mutant kitwk557-8del/t670i isoform at f1,000 nmol/l.
in contrast, imatinib,  xxxd1815xxx , and  xxxd2724xxx  did not inhibit its
phosphorylation even up to 10,000 nmol/l. similar experiments were done on the ba/f3 cells expressing the gatekeeper
single mutant kitt670i , which showed a comparable drug
sensitivity profile. sorafenib significantly inhibited the kinase
activity of this single mutant at 1,000 nmol/l, inhibited cell
growth with an ic50 of 918 nmol/l, and induced significant
apoptosis between 1,000 and 5,000 nmol/l, whereas imatinib,
 xxxd2724xxx , and  xxxd1815xxx  did not show effects on both
biochemical and biological assays (fig. 2).
 xxxd2724xxx  inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis of
imatinib-resistant kitv560del/v654a mutant cells at lower doses
than  xxxd1815xxx  and sorafenib.  xxxd2724xxx  potently inhibited the
proliferation of ba/f3 kitv560del/v654a cells with an ic50 of
192 nmol/l. this double mutant was also sensitive, but at
higher concentrations, to  xxxd1815xxx  and sorafenib inhibition at

an ic50 of 585 and 1,074 nmol/l, respectively (fig. 3a). the
apoptosis assays showed similar results for these three
inhibitors. interestingly, imatinib showed induction of
apoptosis in 50% of cells at 1,000 nmol/l, whereas at 5,000
nmol/l 90% of cells entered programmed cell death (fig. 3b).
biochemically,  xxxd2724xxx ,  xxxd1815xxx , and sorafenib inhibited
kit phosphorylation at 1,000 nmol/l. imatinib partially inhibited the phosphorylation of kitv560del/v654a oncoprotein at
1,000 nmol/l, which was completely inhibited at 5,000 nmol/l
(fig. 3c).
imatinib-resistant kitv559d/d820y was sensitive to  xxxd2724xxx ,
 xxxd1815xxx , and sorafenib inhibition. all three inhibitors tested
decreased cell proliferation of the imatinib-resistant ba/f3
kitv559d/d820y cells (see table 1).  xxxd2724xxx  inhibited cell
growth at an ic50 of 297 nmol/l, whereas sorafenib and
 xxxd1815xxx  had similar effects at a slightly higher dose, ic50 of
944 and 432 nmol/l, respectively.  xxxd1815xxx  induced significant apoptosis at 1,000 nmol/l, whereas  xxxd2724xxx  and
sorafenib showed moderate effect on induction of apoptosis
between 1,000 and 5,000 nmol/l. biochemically, all three
drugs showed distinct inhibition of kit phosphorylation at
1,000 nmol/l.

fig. 2. sorafenib potently inhibited cell proliferation and kinase activity and induced overt apoptosis of the ba/f3 transfectant expressing kitwk557-8del/t670i mutant. imatinib,
 xxxd1815xxx , and  xxxd2724xxx  showed no effect on cell growth or kit kinase activity. a, ba/f3 cells stably expressing kitwk557-8del/t670i were treated with escalating doses of
sorafenib in the presence of 20 ng/ml kl for 48 h. cellular proliferation as determined by bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) incorporation assays was inhibited by sorafenib
at an ic50 of 1,063 nmol/l. other drugs did not show growth inhibition (data not shown) up to 10,000 nmol/l. b, apoptosis assays, measured by  xxxg166xxx  and
7-aminoactinomycin d staining, showed that sorafenib induced significant apoptosis at 1,000 nmol/l. imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx , and  xxxd1815xxx  did not induce overt apoptosis up to
5,000 nmol/l. c, immunoblotting for phosphorylated (py20 + py99) and total forms of kit was done to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the drugs on kitactivation.
sorafenib showed marked kitactivation inhibition at 1,000 nmol/l, whereas the other three drugs did not show an inhibitory effect up to 10,000 nmol/l.

fig. 3. a, sorafenib,  xxxd1815xxx , and  xxxd2724xxx  showed significant inhibition on cell growth of ba/f3 cells expressing kitv560del/v654a at 1,000 nmol/l or lower. imatinib showed
moderate effects between 1,000 and 5,000 nmol/l. b,  xxxd2724xxx  induced significant apoptosis between 100 and 1,000 nmol/l, whereas  xxxd1815xxx , sorafenib, and imatinib
did between 1,000 and 5,000 nmol/l. c,  xxxd2724xxx ,  xxxd1815xxx , and sorafenib showed significant inhibition on kitactivation at 1,000 nmol/l, whereas imatinib at 5,000 nmol/l.

phosphorylation of imatinib-resistant kitv560del/n822k is
inhibited by  xxxd2724xxx  at lower concentrations than  xxxd1815xxx 
and sorafenib. the ba/f3 kitv560del/n822k cells did not achieve
 xxxg1177xxx  independence. biochemically,  xxxd2724xxx  completely
inhibited kit phosphorylation at 100 nmol/l concentration,
whereas  xxxd1815xxx  and sorafenib at 1,000 nmol/l (data not
shown). proliferation and apoptosis studies done on these
 xxxg1177xxx  – dependent cells did not show an effect with any of the
drugs tested. this result might be related to other  xxxg1177xxx  –
dependent signaling pathways not targeted by the drugs tested.

discussion
although most gist patients respond to imatinib initially,
they often develop progressing lesions at multiple metastatic
sites within 2 to 5 years after starting therapy. in most imatinibresistant gists, kit is reactivated and the downstream signaling
pathways remain kit dependent (8, 11). in about half of
imatinib-resistant patients, the development of a second-site
kit mutation is the cause for kit reactivation (8, 11, 12),
whereas in the remaining cases it is largely unknown. the
second-site mutations occur without exception on the same
allele as the primary mutation, affect either the first or second
kinase domains (exons 13, 14, and 17), and are mostly single
amino acid substitutions (8, 10). crystallographic studies
showed that imatinib binds only to the inactive form of kit
(19). secondary kit mutations in the kinase domains stabilize
the active form of kit and thus weaken or prevent its drug

binding, leading to clinical resistance. as the imatinib
alternatives presently tested in clinical trials show a limited
survival benefit (13), there is an urgent need to validate novel
therapeutic strategies, tailored to the mechanism of resistance
in individual patients.
as shown by several groups, the location of the primary
kit or  xxxg1709xxx  mutation directly predicts the clinical
response to imatinib in gist patients. tumors with an
underlying primary kit mutation in exon 11 represent the
subgroup with better response rates than other mutational
subtypes (5, 6). furthermore, this group is also at higher risk
to develop secondary mutations compared with kit exon
9 – mutated gists (8, 11, 12). this observation further supports
that the probability of developing a secondary mutation
increases with duration of imatinib treatment, which often is
longer in gists harboring exon 11 mutation than in those with
exon 9 mutation or wild-type gists. however, the presence of
secondary kit mutations per se within the acquired imatinib
resistance setting is not an indicator of a worse prognosis
compared with imatinib-refractory tumors without secondary
mutations. the latter group escapes the inhibitory efficacy of
imatinib through yet unresolved molecular mechanisms (12).
another level of complexity relies on the fact that long-term
imatinib therapy leads to clonal selection of distinct resistant
tumor subclones, the so-called ‘‘polyclonal acquired resistance’’
(10 – 12). thus, each tumor nodule under progression may
undergo individual clonal evolution, resulting in multiple
secondary mutations developed at different metastatic sites

second-line agents in imatinib-resistant kit mutants

within the same patient. as such, designing salvage strategies in
these imatinib-resistant settings should address inhibition of all
the known genomic activating mutations in the oncoprotein.
most of the prior in vitro drug screening studies on imatinibresistant kit mutants investigate only one drug at a time (9, 20;
see table 2). thus, comparing results between different
laboratories, using different cell systems (primary gist cells,
ba/f3, hek, etc.), is quite difficult. our study undertakes a
detailed investigation of three imatinib alternative small
molecules on a large panel of ba/f3 kit single and double
mutant cells using biological and biochemical methods of
assessing drug response.
previous reports (12) suggested that gists with secondary
kit exon 14 gatekeeper mutations (t670i) show a more
aggressive behavior with earlier metastasis and shorter progression-free survival. of interest is that kitt670i mutation has not
been identified as a primary mutation in gist and only occurs
under the selective pressure of imatinib therapy. the gatekeeper
amino acid t670 of kit was identified as one of the key
hydrogen bonds for imatinib binding (19, 21); thus, mutations
at this position have a profound effect on drug binding. the
bulky isoleucine substituting the threonine residue abolishes
the affinity not only for imatinib but also for  xxxd1815xxx  (22, 23).
similarly, the gatekeeper mutation in bcr-abl, t315i, is
resistant to  xxxd2724xxx  at up to 10,000 nmol/l (14). in keeping
with these findings, the ba/f3 kit cells expressing a t670i
single or double mutant were insensitive to all drugs except
sorafenib. sorafenib was initially designed to inhibit cell
proliferation by targeting the raf/mitogen-activated protein
kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase pathway and tumor angiogenesis by
targeting  xxxg2413xxx  receptor-2/
 xxxg1710xxx  (17). it was recently approved by the food and drug
administration for the treatment of advanced renal cell
carcinoma. sorafenib was also shown to interact with kit,
inhibiting its kit kinase activity in in vitro kinase assays (18).
these data support the ongoing phase ii national cancer
institute – sponsored multicenter investigation of sorafenib in
imatinib- and sunitinib-resistant gist (clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct00265798). however, the biochemical or biological
consequences of sorafenib inhibition in the context of kit
mutant cells have not been yet investigated. importantly, our
results show that sorafenib inhibits the kitt670i gatekeeper
mutation either expressed as a single or double mutant

oncoprotein in the ba/f3 cellular system. thus, sorafenib
inhibited the kit kinase activity and cell growth, as well as
induced apoptosis at 1,000 nmol/l concentration, in both
ba/f3 kitwk557-8del/t670i double mutant and ba/f3 kitt670i
single mutant cells. in fact, sorafenib was the only drug potent
against all different secondary mutations tested, including kit
exons 13 and 17.
 xxxd1815xxx  is a potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of several
kinases, including bcr-abl and src family of kinases (24). it
was recently approved by the food and drug administration
for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and
philadelphia chromosome – positive all with resistance or
intolerance to previous therapy, including imatinib (25).
 xxxd1815xxx  was previously shown to be more potent than
imatinib in inhibiting kitv559d (23), kitv560g (16), and wildtype kit (15). our results also indicate that  xxxd1815xxx  is more
effective than other kinase inhibitors on imatinib-sensitive
exon 11 mutant ba/f3 kitv559d and kitwk557-8del cells.
schittenhelm et al. (16) reported that  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits the
kinase activity of kitv560g/d816v double mutant cells in a dosedependent manner. screening the sensitivity of different
activating  xxxg2198xxx  oncoproteins carrying the gatekeeper
mutation, carter et al. (23) showed that  xxxd1815xxx  has no effect
on kitv559d/t670i double mutant. their results also indicate that
similar gatekeeper mutations in bcr-abl (t315i) and egfr
(t670m) oncoproteins are resistant to  xxxd1815xxx  therapy. our
data support that kitt670i expressed either as a single or double
mutant oncoprotein in the ba/f3 cells confers resistance to
 xxxd1815xxx . in contrast, ba/f3 cells expressing kit exon 13 or
exon 17 single or double mutants were sensitive to  xxxd1815xxx 
inhibition.  xxxd1815xxx  was recently examined in a phase i study
in which gist patients were enrolled (clinicaltrials.gov
identifier nct00099606); final data are not yet published.
 xxxd2724xxx  was specifically designed as a more potent inhibitor
of mutant and wild-type bcr-abl compared with imatinib
(14). in addition, weisberg et al. (14) showed that  xxxd2724xxx  is
as effective as imatinib in inhibiting exon 11 kitv560del and
exon 13 kitk642e mutant ba/f3 cells. in a different study,
 xxxd2724xxx  showed potent inhibition against kitv560g mutant
cells (26). not previously reported, our results indicate
 xxxd2724xxx  efficacy on the kit double mutants involving exon
11 and exons 13 or 17. specifically,  xxxd2724xxx  induced cell
growth inhibition in imatinib-resistant kitv560del/v654a and
kitv559d/d820y mutant cells at lower concentrations than

cancer therapy: preclinical

 xxxd1815xxx  and sorafenib. in contrast,  xxxd2724xxx  was not effective
against the gatekeeper kit exon 14 single (kitt670i) or double
(kitwk557-8del/t670i) mutant. similarly, weisberg et al. (14)
showed that, although  xxxd2724xxx  inhibited all the other
secondary mutations of bcr-abl, it had no effect in inhibiting
the t315i gatekeeper mutation, which is analogous to the
t670i mutation in kit.  xxxd2724xxx  was investigated in combination with imatinib in patients who are imatinib resistant
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct00135005); final results of the
study are pending.
previous preclinical data using the ba/f3 cellular system
showed that imatinib-resistant kit v654a and t670i mutants
are sensitive to sunitinib ( xxxd3264xxx ; ref. 20). the growth of
ba/f3 cells expressing kitwk557-8del/v654a or kitwk557-8del/t670i
was completely inhibited by sunitinib at concentrations below
500 nmol/l (ic50, 50-100 nmol/l; table 2). although other
imatinib-resistant kit mutants, such as the more common
second kinase domain kit mutations, were not investigated,
ba/f3 cells expressing  xxxg1709xxx -d842v were less sensitive
to sunitinib, and their growth proliferation was inhibited at
5 amol/l.
anecdotal evidence based mainly on molecular modeling of
mutated kit receptors suggests that some secondary mutations
acquired in the imatinib resistance setting might be weaker
than others (27). although most second-site kit mutations
affect the imatinib-binding site, the extent of structural changes
conferred varies with the individual amino acid substitution;
thus, t670i substantially modifies the binding pocket, whereas
v654a induces only relatively confined changes (8, 27). when
compared with the biochemical activity of kit kinase,
tamborini et al. (27) showed that, in both substitutions, the
phosphorylation of the receptor persisted in the presence of
3 mmol/l imatinib, in keeping with an activated status of the
kit receptors. however, the single and double mutant kitv654a
oncoprotein expressed in cos cells seemed to be unphosphorylated at 6 mmol/l imatinib, whereas the single and
double mutant kitt670i did not. these results suggest that the
effects of v654a mutation might be subverted by a dose
escalation of the imatinib and it would be expected that a
clinical response would be restored. our results are in support
of these findings, showing that imatinib partially inhibited the

phosphorylation of kitv560del/v654a oncoprotein at 1,000
nmol/l, which was completely inhibited at 5,000 nmol/l.
similarly, induction of apoptosis with imatinib was evident at
1,000 nmol/l in 50% of cells, whereas at 5,000 nmol/l most
cells entered programmed cell death.
alternative salvage options other than inhibiting kit
signaling pathway are presently being explored. these strategies promise a therapeutic solution to the challenge of heterogeneous imatinib resistance. bauer et al. (28) investigated
the activity of heat shock protein 90 inhibitor 17-allylamino18-demethoxy- xxxd2187xxx  ( xxxd717xxx ) in enhancing cellular
degradation of constitutively activated kit oncoprotein. thus,
 xxxd717xxx  was effective in inhibiting kit-dependent imatinibsensitive and imatinib-resistant gist cell lines but not
kit-independent gist cells, suggesting that its effects result
mainly from inactivation of kit oncoprotein. taking a different approach, sambol et al. (29) showed the efficacy of  xxxd135xxx , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, on a primary
gist cell line carrying an imatinib-sensitive kit k642e exon
13 mutation, by induction of apoptosis and transcriptional
down-regulation of kit. a possible combination of targeted
kinase inhibitors with drugs such as  xxxd135xxx  or  xxxd717xxx 
may be more effective in the setting of polyclonal acquired
resistance.
in conclusion, second-line  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors are
selectively potent against imatinib-resistant kit mutations and
might provide an effective alternative to imatinib in the management of these patients. specifically, sorafenib was found to
be effective against all the kit double mutants tested, including
the secondary mutation in the ‘‘gatekeeper’’ residue (kitt670i),
which is resistant to the other kinase inhibitors. in contrast,
imatinib-resistant kitv560del/v654a and kitv559d/d820y mutant
cells were inhibited by all three inhibitors tested, with  xxxd2724xxx 
showing a lower ic50 than  xxxd1815xxx  and sorafenib. these
in vitro data set the stage for designing future clinical trials,
where selection of the second-generation kinase inhibitor will
be tailored based on the individual mechanism of imatinib
resistance. the presence of a kitt670i gatekeeper mutation for
example in the resistant disease may indicate sorafenib or
sunitinib as the next therapeutic option, whereas other
secondary mutations may be more susceptible to  xxxd2724xxx .
