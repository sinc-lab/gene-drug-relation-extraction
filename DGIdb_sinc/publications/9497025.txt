selective  xxxg658xxx  antagonists reverse apomorphine-induced
blockade of prepulse inhibition
received : 13 may 1997 / final version : 15 july 1997

abstract recent evidence suggests that the dopamine
 xxxg658xxx  may play a role in schizophrenia, and that
the atypical properties of the antipsychotic clozapine
may be attributable in part to its antagonistic actions
at this receptor. in the present study, clozapine and
three other compounds having d4 dopamine receptor
antagonist properties were examined for their e¤ectiveness in reducing losses in prepulse inhibition (ppi)
induced in rats by the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine. previously, activity in the ppi model has
been shown to correlate highly with the antipsychotic
potency of a number of neuroleptics. as previously
reported, clozapine (15.6 mg / kg) signiþcantly reduced
apomorphine-induced ppi deþcits. the three d4-selective compounds, cp-293,019 (5.6 17.8 mg / kg), u101,387 (330 mg / kg) and l-745,870 (110 mg / kg),
also signiþcantly blocked the losses in ppi produced
by apomorphine. taken together, these results suggest
that dopamine receptor antagonists with selectivity for
the d4 dopamine receptor subtype may be e¤ective in
the treatment of schizophrenia, while being less likely
to produce dyskinesias associated with  xxxg656xxx 
antagonists.

introduction
accumulating evidence has implicated the dopamine
 xxxg658xxx  in certain aspects of schizophrenic pathophysiology (seeman and van tol 1994). in contrast to

d2 receptors, which are densely expressed in corticostiatal dopamine neurons, d4 receptors are preferentially expressed in limbic structures and in prefrontal
cortex (pfc), an area associated with the appearance
of negative symptoms in schizophrenia (van tol et al.
1991).  xxxg658xxx  abundance has also been reported
to be elevated in postmortem brain tissue of schizophrenics (seeman and van tol 1993). another link
between schizophrenia and the  xxxg658xxx  stems from
the unusual pharmacological proþle of the atypical
antipsychotic clozapine. clozapine is an e¤ective medication against both negative and positive symptoms
of schizophrenia, and does not produce parkinsonianlike motor e¤ects which commonly accompany chronic
administration of typical d2 antipsychotics (kane
et al. 1988). clozapine binds with high a¦nity to both
human d2 and d4 receptors, but is selective for d4
receptors (van tol et al. 1991; roth et al. 1995). under
clinical conditions, cerebrospinal ßuid concentrations
of clozapine are consistent with e¤ective blockade of
d4, but not d2, receptors (seeman 1992).
di¤erences in the regional distributions of d2 and
d4 receptors, as well as its modest selectivity for the
 xxxg658xxx , suggest that clozapine may exert its therapeutic e¤ect on limbic or cortical d4 sites while having a lesser action on basal ganglia d2 receptors
responsible for dyskinesias. functional data also indicate a preferential activation of frontal cortex versus
basal ganglia by clozapine (holland et al. 1996).
because of the unusual properties of clozapine, e¤orts
have been directed toward identiþcation of selective
d4 antagonists which would produce e¦cacy in schizophrenia without inducing extrapyramidal side-e¤ects
(e.g. kulagowski et al. 1996). in addition to having a
lesser liability for producing extrapyramidal syndromes
and tardive dyskinesias, d4 antagonists might be
expected to mirror clozapine in their e¦cacy against
negative symptoms and treatment-resistant patient
populations (kane et al. 1988). to evaluate the
potential antipsychotic e¤ects of d4 antagonists, we

employed the prepulse inhibition (ppi) model of
acoustic startle in rats.
ppi is a model of sensorimotor gating in which a
weak acoustic stimulus modiþes the behavioral e¤ect
of a second, more intense, stimulus. the þrst of the two
acoustic stimuli, the prepulse, does not produce a
behavioral response but is capable of modifying the
startle reßex induced by the louder tone. the presence
of the prepulse is correlated with a decrease in startle
reßex amplitude as produced by intense acoustic stimuli or by tactile stimuli. ppi is a time-linked phenomenon which has been extensively characterized in
humans and animals, and is notably diminished in
schizophrenics (bra¤ et al. 1978). drugs which produce
psychosis-like states in humans generally produce disruptions of acoustic startle ppi in rats (mansbach
et al. 1988; mansbach and geyer 1989; sipes and geyer
1994). in addition, blockade of ppi in rats by the
dopaminergic agonist apomorphine is reversed by
many clinically e¤ective antipsychotics with high
a¦nity for d2 receptors (swerdlow et al. 1994a).
although apomorphine is often referred to as a d2 agonist, it binds with moderate preference (10-fold) for the
d4 versus the  xxxg656xxx  (table 2) and its e¤ects might
therefore be sensitive to antagonists at the  xxxg658xxx . in the present study, the e¤ects of three potent
and selective d4 antagonists (cp-293,019, l-745,870,
and  xxxd3224xxx ; fig. 1)(kulagowski et al. 1996;
merchant et al. 1996; zorn et al. 1996) were evaluated
in the apomorphine-ppi model and compared with the
classical d2 antagonist haloperidol, and the atypical
antipsychotic clozapine. restorative e¤ects of d4 antagonists on apomorphine-disrupted ppi would be suggestive of antipsychotic potential for this class of
compounds.

background noise. startle trials were separated by 15 s of background noise. the mean score for each animal was used for assignment to experimental groups; each group was balanced so as to
result in approximately equal mean startle scores in all groups.
prepulse inhibition sessions, which occurred 24  48 h later, contained presentations of four di¤erent trial types, administered in a
varying order in three blocks of 12 trials each. within each block,
there were four presentations of the 120-db stimulus alone, four
presentations of this stimulus preceded by 100 ms with a 20-ms,
72-db prepulse, two presentations of the prepulse alone, and two
trials in which there were no changes in stimulus conditions
but stabilimeter samples were recorded (no-stimulus, or nostim,
trials). the three blocks of trials were preceded by an initial
120-db trial which was not used in the data analysis. startle results
were analyzed for e¤ects on amplitude and prepulse inhibition.
prepulse inhibition was deþned as magnitude of startle in trials
preceded by a prepulse expressed as a percentage of startle magnitudes in trials where a prepulse was not presented. prior to ppi sessions, rats were injected with vehicle or antagonists, followed by
an injection of 1.0 mg / kg apomorphine or its vehicle. the challenge
dose of apomorphine was selected from preliminary data as one
that would reliably disrupt ppi.

data analysis

materials and methods
subjects and apparatus
adult male wistar rats (charles river) were used as subjects.
animals were housed in individual cages with continuous access to
water and lab chow. studies were conducted using san diego
instruments (san diego, calif., usa) startle chambers and associated interface equipment. an ibm-compatible personal computer
delivered stimuli and collected data, which were stored on magnetic
media. acoustic stimuli were delivered by a radio shack
supertweeter located in the chambers ceiling. responses were
detected by a sealed accelerometer device. data were collected as
100, one-ms voltage readings which began immediately after the
onset of startle-eliciting stimuli. responses were rectiþed, digitized,
and stored on microcomputer. the average of the 100 readings was
selected as the dependent measure.

procedure
one week after arrival, rats were tested in a brief startle response
session consisting of 20 presentations of a 120-db[a] noise, 40 ms
in duration. the session began with a 5-min period of 67-db[a]

to evaluate the e¤ects of apomorphine and of d4 antagonists on
prepulse inhibition, two-way analyses of variance (anova) were
conducted on percentage ppi scores with apomorphine and antagonist as main factors. if a signiþcant alteration in apomorphinedisrupted ppi was detected by a two-way interaction, then separate
one-way anovas were conducted for groups administered either
apomorphine or apomorphine vehicle. dunnetts tests with vehicle
or apomorphine alone as a reference followed any signþcant results
from these one-way anovas. in addition, analyses were conducted
on the absolute ppi and startle magnitude measures. these data
were analyzed by three-way anova with trial type, apomorphine,
and antagonist as factors. only trial types containing startle-eliciting stimuli were included in this analysis.

receptor binding
ltk and cos cells expressing the human d2 long and the human
d4.4 receptor, respectively, were obtained from dr. olivier civelli
(oregon health sciences university, portland, ore., usa) and dr.
j.r. dewet (pþzer central research, groton, conn., usa). the
cells were grown (t-175 ßasks) in dmem (gibco) supplemented
with 10 % fetal bovine serum (fbs). the cells were dislodged with
5 mm edta in pbs and homogenized in 50 mm tris hcl (ph
7.4), with 5 mm  xxxd2534xxx , using a brinkman polytron at setting 6

for 20 s. membranes were recovered after multiple rounds of separation by centrifugation and resuspension in fresh ice-cold bu¤er.
the tissue (~2 mg, wet weight) was added to test tubes containing
incubation bu¤er (50 mm tris hcl, 120 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl2,
5 mm kcl, and 2 mm cacl2, ph 7.4) various concentrations of
test drug, and [3h]-spiperone [0.125 nm (d2) and 0.2 nm (d4.4)
þnal concentration; amersham, arlington heights ill., usa]. nonspeciþc binding was determined in the presence of 10 µm (+)-butaclamol. after 45 min at 30°c, incubations were terminated by rapid
þltration through whatman gf / b þlters using a brandel cell harvester. the membranes were washed with 3 × 4 ml of ice-cold bu¤er
and membrane-bound ligand was determined by liquid scintillation
counting of the þlters in ready-safe scintillation cocktail (for tritiated ligands). apparent kis were calculated by means of the
cheng-pruso¤ equation (cheng and pruso¤ 1973).

drugs
compounds other than haloperidol (research biochemicals inc.)
and apomorphine (sigma, st louis mo., usa) were synthesized at
pþzer central research. clozapine free base, (7r,9as)-7-(4ßuorophenoxy)methyl-2-(5-ßuoropyrimidin-2-yl)-2,3,4,6,7,8,9,9aoctahydro-1h- xxxd3047xxx [1, 2-a]pyrazine (cp-293,019) hcl, l-745,870
hcl, and  xxxd3224xxx  hcl were administered 1 h prior to the þrst
startle stimulus. haloperidol was administered 20 min and (±)apomorphine hcl (1 mg / kg) was administered 5 min before the þrst
startle stimulus. the drug vehicles were as follows : apomorphine,
clozapine and haloperidol, 0.1 % acetic acid; cp-293,019, u101,387, 40 % cyclodextrin; l-745,870, distilled water. all drugs
were administered sc. doses of salt-containing compounds were
calculated as the salt.

results
e¤ects of haloperidol and clozapine
as previously reported, both haloperidol (0.1 mg / kg)
and clozapine (15.6 mg / kg) reversed apomorphinedisrupted ppi (fig. 2). analyses of percentage ppi
data conþrmed for both drugs a signiþcant e¤ect of

apomorphine, antagonist and apomorphine-by-antagonist interactions. analysis of absolute scores on both
drugs conþrmed a signiþcant e¤ect of apomorphine
and apomorphine-by-antagonist interactions. a
signiþcant main e¤ect of haloperidol was attributable
to its restoration of prepulse-inhibited startle (table 1).
e¤ects of selective d4 antagonists
the e¤ects of cp-293,019 are presented in fig. 3.
analysis of percentage ppi data conþrmed signiþcant
main e¤ects of apomorphine, cp-293,019 and a
signiþcant interaction, [f(3,89) = 4.0, p < 0.01]. oneway anova on the apomorphine-treated groups
revealed a signiþcant e¤ect of cp-293,019 on ppi, with
a signiþcant dunnetts value on the comparison
between vehicle and the 17.8 mg / kg group. on absolute
scores, there were signiþcant main e¤ects of apomorphine and cp-293,019, but no interaction between the
two factors [f(3,82) = 2.3]. analysis of groups treated
with cp-293,019 or its vehicle in the absence of
apomorphine treatment revealed a signiþcant startledecreasing e¤ect of the drug, with post-hoc signiþcance
at the 5.6 and 17.8 mg / kg doses.
the e¤ects of l-745,870 are presented in fig. 4.
l-745,870 produced a dose-dependent reversal of the
apomorphine-induced ppi deþcit, as indicated by the
signiþcant apomorphine-by-antagonist interaction,
[f(3,77) = 3.3, p < 0.03]. main e¤ects of apomorphine
and l-745,870 were also observed on the percentage
measure. both the 3 mg / kg and 10 mg / kg doses signiþcantly reversed apomorphines e¤ects, as conþrmed
by dunnetts comparisons following a signiþcant oneway anova on the apomorphine-treated groups
[f(3,38) = 5.4, p < 0.004]. analysis of the absolute startle magnitudes revealed no main e¤ects of either apomorphine or l-745870, and no interaction.

analysis of the startle amplitudes resulted in no main
e¤ects of apomorphine or  xxxd3224xxx , and no interaction. because the e¤ective dose of  xxxd3224xxx  appeared
to coincide with decreases in startle amplitude, additional one-way analyses were conducted on startlestimulus alone trials in the presence and absence of

produce a signiþcant e¤ect on startle amplitude.

discussion
the results of the present study demonstrate activity
of three selective  xxxg658xxx  antagonists in the apomorphine-ppi model, a procedure advanced as a valid
model for the identiþcation of antipsychotic drugs
(swerdlow et al. 1994a). for comparison, we also studied the typical antipsychotic haloperidol and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. as previously reported,
both haloperidol and clozapine reversed deþcits in ppi
induced by the dopamine agonist, apomorphine
(mansbach et al. 1988; swerdlow et al. 1991; swerdlow
and geyer 1993).
as with haloperidol, clozapine and the selective d4
antagonists reversed ppi deþcits at doses which in most
cases had no signiþcant e¤ects on startle magnitude.
there were instances in which e¤ective doses of cp293,019 and  xxxd3224xxx  appeared to be associated with
decreases in baseline startle (table 2), but it was clear
that there was no systematic relationship between startle magnitude and the e¦cacy of d4 antagonists to normalize ppi. on the other hand, we did not observe any
signiþcant e¤ects of any dopamine antagonist on ppi
when given alone. elevations in baseline ppi with
antagonists have been reported (e.g. swerdlow and
geyer 1993), but do not appear to be consistent enough
to propose as a reßection of antipsychotic activity.
the role of d4 antagonism in the treatment of schizophrenia has been di¦cult to establish; several clinically e¤ective antipsychotics bind with low nanomolar
a¦nity to d4 receptors, but these compounds generally possess high a¦nity at d2 receptors as well
(seeman and van tol 1994). clozapine in particular
was þrst described as an atypical antipsychotic

because it results in a low incidence of extrapyramidal
syndrome (eps); this property is thought to stem in
part from its relatively lower a¦nity for d2 receptors
(van tol et al. 1991). the distribution of d4 receptors,
to which clozapine binds avidly, has also been cited as
a factor which may provide insight into the improved
e¦cacy of clozapine against negative symptoms of
schizophrenia, as cortical hypofrontality has been suggested to be partly responsible for these symptoms
(wolkin et al. 1992). d4 receptors are preferentially
expressed in cortical and limbic structures in comparison to their expression in striatum, whereas the distribution is reversed for d2 receptors (van tol et al.
1991). interestingly, clozapine and the more d4-selective compounds cp-293,019 and  xxxd3224xxx  produce
regionally selective changes in the activity of cfos,
which are consistent with the distribution of d4 receptors (robertson et al. 1994; holland et al. 1996;
merchant et al. 1996). because of its preferential
expression in pfc, its occupancy by clozapine at therapeutic concentrations, and its relative independence
of activities associated with extrapyramidal signs,
the  xxxg658xxx  has become an attractive target for
the development of safe antipsychotics that can be
used in typical, as well as treatment-resistant, patient
populations.
the complete restoration of apomorphine-induced
losses in ppi by selective  xxxg658xxx  antagonists is
somewhat surprising in light of considerable evidence
suggesting that apomorphines e¤ect on ppi is mediated by d2 receptors. swerdlow et al. (1994a) reported
high correlations between the clinical potency of
antipsychotic medications and their potency in blocking the apomorphine-ppi deþcit in rats. potencies in
the animal model were in turn highly correlated with
a¦nity for d2 receptors (swerdlow et al. 1994a). other
evidence suggests that although d1 and d3 receptors
may play a role in the modulation of ppi by dopamine
agonists, activity at d2 receptors appears to be most
closely associated with both induction and reversal of
ppi deþcits (swerdlow et al. 1991; caine et al. 1995;
wan et al. 1996). the present data suggest that d2
a¦nity is not a prerequisite for reversal of drug-induced
losses in ppi, as was also demonstrated for the 5-ht2aselective antipsychotic, mdl 100,907, against doidisrupted ppi (padich et al. 1996).

199

although much compelling evidence links ppi to d2
receptors, particularly with regard to their role in the
present apomorphine model, until recently there have
not been su¦ciently selective ligands for a comprehensive evaluation of the role of d4 receptors.
experiments with one highly selective  xxxg658xxx 
antagonist,  xxxd3224xxx  (merchant et al. 1996), have
shown this compound to be relatively insensitive to the
e¤ects of amphetamine on locomotor behavior and to
apomorphine on cage-climbing behavior. moreover,
 xxxd3224xxx  did not produce catalepsy, as do typical
antipsychotics with signiþcant  xxxg656xxx  a¦nity, nor
did it alter apomorphine-induced decreases in cell þring
recorded in substantia nigra (merchant et al. 1996).
similarly, cp-293,019 did not produce e¤ects reßective
of d2 antagonist activity (catalepsy, blockade of stereotypy, elevation in prolactin) at doses higher than those
found to be e¤ective in the present study (zorn et al.
1996). in addition to its well-known agonist actions at
d2 receptors, including d2-mediated behavioral e¤ects
linked to striatal circuitry, apomorphine binds with
moderate a¦nity to d4 receptors, where it functions as
an agonist (seeman and van tol 1993; s. zorn, unpublished observations). taken together with the present
data in the ppi model, the 10-fold selectivity of apomorphine for d4 versus d2 receptors suggests that
despite its clear role in d2-mediated behaviors, it may
produce behavioral e¤ects relevant to schizophrenia
that are not assessed by most motor-based procedures.
the data with  xxxd3224xxx  are consistent with the
reported distributional di¤erences of d2 and  xxxg658xxx  mrna (meador-woodru¤ 1994), and further support suggestions that  xxxg658xxx  antagonists would be
unlikely to produce eps. however, at least one of the
d4 antagonists, cp-293,019, was shown to reverse apomorphine-enhanced locomotion in the rat, although it
did not induce catalepsy or block apomorphineinduced stereotypy (zorn et al. 1996). taken together,
these data suggest that several procedures normally sensitive to the e¤ects of antipsychotics, including those
based on the stimulatory e¤ects of non-selective
dopamine agonists, are tied primarily to d2-mediated
behaviors and may not adequately address the potential role of d4 receptors in the pharmacological control of psychosis.
the reversal of apomorphine-induced ppi deþcits by
selective d4 antagonists represents further support for
suggestions that the activity of dopamine-releasing
neurons in pfc may exert tonic control over subcortical structures important in regulating gating
processes. as noted earlier, hypofunction of dopaminergic systems in the pfc has been suggested as a correlate of negative symptomology in schizophrenia.
according to this model, normal dopaminergic function in pfc would inhibit excitatory projections back
to mesolimbic structures, principally the nucleus
accumbens. accordingly, 6-hydroxydopamine lesions
of the pfc and direct infusion of dopamine into the

nucleus accumbens both disrupt ppi (swerdlow et al.
1990; bubser and koch 1994). the e¤ects of apomorphine on ppi are also inßuenced by lesions of pfc;
swerdlow et al. (1994b) reported that normally
ine¤ective doses of apomorphine disrupted ppi when
systemically injected into rats with ibotenic acid lesions
of pfc. these data suggest a supersensitivity of ppiregulating mesolimbic dopamine systems following a
loss of pfc-governed neuronal inhibition. because
d4 antagonists appear to elevate the activity of
dopaminergic neurons in pfc (presumably through
autoreceptor blockade) (merchant et al. 1996; zorn
et al. 1996), apomorphine-induced e¤ects may be inhibited at mesolimbic substrates through a d2-independent mechanism.
the hypothesis that the  xxxg658xxx  may be
important in schizophrenia is based primarily on circumstantial evidence stemming from its regional
distribution, the pharmacological proþle of clozapine,
and the high a¦nity of many known antipsychotics for
d4 receptors. in the present study, three selective d4
receptor antagonists were active in an animal model
previously shown to predict with high accuracy the
e¦cacy of antipsychotic drugs (swerdlow et al. 1994a).
the apomorphine-ppi procedure does not, however,
clearly distinguish between medications with a typical
antipsychotic proþle and clozapine, which is e¤ective
against negative symptoms and in many treatmentresistant patients. whether antipsychotic activity superior to that of conventional treatments can be achieved

ultimately be tested in the clinic.
