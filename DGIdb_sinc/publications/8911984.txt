of the sulfonylurea,  xxxd2203xxx , at n-cells

for its (3-cell membrane binding proteins. steady state, kinetic
and competitive binding studies revealed a 3- to 4-fold lower
binding affinity of  xxxd2203xxx  to isolated 13-cell membranes and
intact (3-cells compared to  xxxd2215xxx . direct photoaffinity
labeling of 3-cell membrane proteins with the radiolabeled sulfonylureas identified a 65-kda binding protein for  xxxd2203xxx 
and a 140-koa binding protein for glibendamide which may be
the basis for the different binding characteristics of the two sulfonylureas. the inhibition of binding and photoaffinity labeling
of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  to the 65- and 140-kda protein,
respectively, by  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx  can be explained
with allosteric interactions between two distinct sulfonylurea
binding proteins, subunits of a katp protein complex, each regulating the open/closed-state of a common separate pore-forming
subunit by allosteric interactions. whole-cell patch-clamp experi-

ments with rinm5f cells demonstrated a 3- to 4-fold lower
depolarization activity of  xxxd2203xxx  compared to  xxxd2215xxx 

which correlates well with the lower binding affinity of
 xxxd2203xxx . the lower binding affinity and depolarization activity of  xxxd2203xxx  were not reflected in vitro in perifused islets
and the isolated perfused pancreas of the rat. this discrepancy
remains to be elucidated. the binding, depolarisation and insulin
releasing characteristics of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  suggest that different sulfonylureas can interact with different components of kaip.

key words: non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(niddm) — sulfonylureas —  xxxd2215xxx  — sulfonylurea receptor — katp channels — insulin secretion

at the molecular level. the characterization was performed
with the novel sulfonylurea,  xxxd2203xxx  (11,20) in comparison
with the conventional sulfonylurea  xxxd2215xxx .

interaction with the pancreatic (3-cell
binding of sulfonylureas to receptor proteins of the pancreatic
(3-cell increases the closed probability of the atp-dependent
k channel (kair). the resulting depolarization of the (3-cell

plasma membrane ultimately induces the exocytosis of insulin
via a series of events which are still not fully understood at the
molecular level (fig. 1). it has been suggested that, in addition
to a direct interaction of sulfonylureas with the ka of the (3-cell

plasma membrane, there are intracellular targets by which
they induce an insulin release: 1) in electropermeabilized 13cells, in which i<atp are bypassed,  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  still caused insulin secretion (9). 2)ln insulin-secreting
rinm5f cells,  xxxd2203xxx  dose-dependently provoked the release of glucokinase from mitochondrial pori into the cytosol
(20). this  xxxd2203xxx -mediated loss of glucokinase binding affinity at the outer membrane of mitochondria might ultimately
lead to an increased channelling of mitochondrial atp to the
katp in the (3-cell. however, as reviewed by panten, schwanstecher and schwanstecher (24), the inhibition of kaii seems to
be the major mechanism by which sulfonylureas stimulate insulin secretion.

sulfonylureas bind to the plasma membrane of the pancreatic
(3-cell with high specificity and affinity (12,14). steady state
and kinetic binding experiments with membranes of the solid
nedh rat (3-cell tumor and of rat insulinoma (rin) m5f-cells
as well as with intact rinm5f-cells revealed that the affinity
constants (kd values) of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  as well
as the association (lc<,, values) and dissociation (k0ff values) rate

introduction

constants for their binding are also markedly different

in short-term therapy of niddm patients, sulfonylureas cause
reduction of blood glucose predominantly via the stimulation
of insulin release from pancreatic (3-cells (18). in addition, in

times and 8- to 9-times, respectively, higher than those of

long-term treatment an insulin-independent blood glucose
decreasing activity is assumed to operate (21,20). this paper
gives a summary and an extension of our present view of the
mode of action of sulfonylurea compounds in pancreatic (3-cells

(table 1). the koa and k values of  xxxd2203xxx  are 2.5- to 3glibenclamide. for membranes of the nedh rat (3-cell tumor,
the kd value calculated from the k05 and k0 values (k011/k0) for
 xxxd2203xxx  was 1.9 rim and for  xxxd2215xxx  0.4nm. the 3-

to 4-times higher affinity constant of  xxxd2203xxx  compared to
that of  xxxd2215xxx  was confirmed by binding studies under
steady state conditions (scatchard analysis), the values being
1.5nm for  xxxd2203xxx  and 0.5nm for  xxxd2215xxx  (19). similar values for the k01f/kq. ratio and the steady state k, were also
found for membranes from rinm5f cells and intact rinm5f cells,

from references 56,7,15,16).
panel a: at low glucose concentrations resulting in low cytosolic atp
levels and in the absence of sulfonylureas, the kaip at the plasma membrane of pancreatic 3-cells are flickering between the open and closed

state whereby a certain open probability is maintained by the interaction of the sulfonylurea binding proteins with the channel forming subunits of the katp. this determines the resting potential across the plasma

membrane. the constant resting potential keeps the voltage-dependent ca" channels at the plasma membrane in the closed state. the low
cytosolic ca2' concentration does not support exocytosis of insulin-con
taming secretory vesicles.

panel b: glucose influx into the 3-cell is increased at higher concentrations caused by transport across the plasma membrane via the glucose
transporter isoform  xxxg2134xxx . intracellular glucose is phosphorylated by
glucokinase and subsequently metabolized to yield atp. the raised
atp/adp ratio will increase the closed probability of the kaip (for a review see ref. 4). binding of sulfonylurea to its respective binding protein
also favors the closed state of the katp, possiblyvia inducing uncoupling
of the binding protein from the channel forming subunit(s) of the katp.
the sulfonylurea effect is most effective if some glucose is available (26,
31). inhibition of the kaip results in reduced k' efflux and thereby causes
depolarization of the plasma membrane, which in turn leads to opening
of the voltage-dependent ca2* channels. the increased influx of ca"

triggers the fusion of insulin-containing secretory granules with the

plasma membrane, presumably involving a cascade of protein
phosphorylations mediated by ca"/calmodulmn-dependent protein kinase and isoforms of protein kinase c.

the lower binding affinity of  xxxd2203xxx  compared to that of
 xxxd2215xxx  was also confirmed by homologous and heter-

the ic,, value of  xxxd2203xxx  for the inhibition of  xxxd2215xxx 

ologous competition studies under steady state conditions.
higher concentrations of unlabeled  xxxd2203xxx  compared to
those of  xxxd2215xxx  were required for half maximal dis-

for inhibition of  xxxd2203xxx  binding (table 1). compatible with

the differences between  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  in the
binding characteristics to 13-cells do not allow one to differentiate whether the two drugs bind to the same or to different
binding sites located on the same or on separate receptor proteins. for  xxxd2215xxx  and the sulfonylurea  xxxd2205xxx  distinct binding sites have been postulated (36). for  xxxd2215xxx 
and  xxxd2203xxx , different binding proteins even seem to exist:
covalent attachment of [3h] xxxd2203xxx  and [3h ] xxxd2215xxx 
to their respective binding protein by means of direct photoaffinity labeling of 13-cell membrane proteins with the radiolabeled authentic sulfonylurea in the absence or presence of
authentic unlabeled drug and subsequent sds-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (page) revealed the specific binding of

 xxxd2215xxx  to a 140-kda protein (2,10,17) and of
 xxxd2203xxx  to a 65-kda protein (15). in spite of the putative
interaction with different binding proteins,  xxxd2203xxx  and
 xxxd2215xxx  inhibit each other's binding presuiiiably via al
losteric interactions which occur between the two proteins. in
photoaffinity labeling studies with membranes of the solid
nedh rat 13-cell tumor, an excess of unlabeled  xxxd2203xxx  in-

hibited photolabeling of the 140-kda binding protein with
radiolabeled authentic  xxxd2215xxx  in a concentrationdependent manner and, vice versa, unlabeled  xxxd2215xxx 
inhibited the photolabeling of the 65-kda binding protein with
radiolabeled authentic  xxxd2203xxx .

additional binding proteins have been described for  xxxd2215xxx : sds page analysis of membrane proteins from hamster insulin-secreting tumor cells after photocrosslinking with

selective channel protein, bir, of the 13-cell in a functional coinplex (13). bir is a member of the small inward (weak) rectifier
l(atp family with 390 amino acids and two putative transmembrane segments. both sur and bir seem to be simultaneously
expressed in large amounts in the pancreatic 13-cells and glu-

cose-responsive insulin-secreting cell lines. their genes are
clustered on human chromosome 11 in immediate neighborhood. coexpression of sur and bir in cos cells and xenopus
oocytes by transfection with the corresponding cdnas leads to

the appearance of the atp- and  xxxd2215xxx  sensitive
potassium currents. expression of either sur or bir alone had
no effect on basal rb efflux and produced no additional k* currents upon addition of  xxxd2215xxx . it is therefore assumed
that the kaw of the 13-cell is a complex of at least two subunits,
sur and bir, with unknown stoichiometry. sur activates bir,
keeping the pore-forming subunit of kaw in the open state, and
confers  xxxd2215xxx  sensitivity on katp. certain mutations of

sur causing persistent familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (33) as well as binding of  xxxd2215xxx  to
sur may cause uncoupling of sur from bir leading to channel
closure. in as far as cos cells orxenopus oocytes do not contain

intrinsic 65-kda  xxxd2203xxx  binding protein and a defect in
sur is sufficient for channel closure, the 65-kda glimepiridebinding protein has a role in regulating channel activity, which
differs from that of sur: 1) the 65-kda protein may actively
induce channel closure upon occupancy with  xxxd2203xxx  independent of sur occupancy (mediated possibly via allosteric
interactions). in contrast to sur, in the unoccupied state the

65-kda binding protein may be unable to keep the channel

authentic [h] xxxd2215xxx  revealed two labeled proteins

open. 2) channel closure by occupancy of the 65-kda

with apparent molecular weights of 170 and 140 kda (22). in
gel filtration chromatography under nondenaturating condi-

 xxxd2203xxx -binding protein may depend on the presence of

tions as well as in radiation inactivation analysis, a photolabeled [3h ] xxxd2215xxx -bi nding protein (166—182 kda
during sds-page) behaved as  xxxg220xxx  of a 250-kda protein
complex (30). a glibenclamicle analogue with iodo and azide

substituents was photoincorporated into polypeptides which
migrated during sds-page with an apparent molecular weight
of 160 kda and 38 kda. i.abeling of the 38-kda protein was not
detected after boiling of the sample in sds buffer prior to electrophoresis (28). if these photolabeled polypeptides function

as specific sulfonylurea-binding proteins, their role as poreforming and/or channel activity regulating subunits of katp remains to be elucidated.

so far, the molecular structure is only known for the 140-kda
 xxxd2215xxx  binding protein, sur (3). sur consists of 1582

amino acids constituting 13 transmembrane-spanning
domains, one n-linked glycosylation site, multiple phosphorylation sites for protein kinases a and c and two potential nucleotide binding folds. transient expression of sur in xenopus
oocytes and 1-iek 293 cells demonstrated that sur can couple

to several types of non-atp-dependent inwardly rectifying
potassium channels which thereby are rendered sulfonylurea
but not atp-sensitive (1). the nucleotide-binding folds of sur

functional sur, whereas sur and  xxxd2215xxx  function presumably does not require expression of the 65-kda protein.

in light of the evidence that sulfonylureas have different binding proteins as components of a protein assembly controlling
the open probability of the katp and in light of the possible
modes of their regulation and interaction which have been discussed, it will be interesting to see whether cotransfected cos
cells expressing both bir and sur/ xxxd2203xxx -binding protein
are able to respond to sulfonylureas other than  xxxd2215xxx ,
in particular to  xxxd2203xxx .
the difference between  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  in their
binding characteristics to 13-cells is reflected in their depolarization activity. in the presence of 100 pm  xxxd1868xxx  (k channel
opener),  xxxd2203xxx  added to the bath solution in the whole
cell patch clamp depolarized the rinm5f cell with an lc() of
27.3 nm, the lc0 of  xxxd2215xxx  being 7.4 nm (go,gelcir,, unpublished data).
experimental evidence hints at a location of the sulfonylureabinding site on sur at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma inem
brane (24), which necessitates passage of the sulfonylurea

across the membrane bilayer. therefore, differences in

lipophilicity of the substituents have been suspected of being

the major reason for the differences in affinity for receptor
binding and depolarization activity of sulfonylureas (25). in
this regard, the lower depolarization activity of  xxxd2203xxx

may mediate the inhibitory effect of mg2atp on the binding
of  xxxd2215xxx  to sur (27). the amino acid sequence of sijr
strongly suggests that it is a member of the large family of atpbinding cassette proteins which also includes the multidrug resistance (related) proteins. sur interacts with the potassium

of increase in drug concentrations at the internal membrane

storage compartments into the cytosol. this possibility, however, does not fit in with the lower octanol/water partitioning
coefficient of 50 for  xxxd2203xxx  compared to 94 for  xxxd2215xxx  at ph 7.4 (35). this argues against a lower diffusion
rate of  xxxd2203xxx  being responsible for its lower depolarization activity.
binding affinity, depolarization activity and insulin-secretion
stimulating activity correlate positively with each other for

conventional sulfonylureas on condition that the potencies
were determined under steady-state conditions. this argues
for closure of katp as being the predominant target for the sulfonylurea-induced insulin release (23,26, 32). the lower bind-

ing affinity and depolarization activity of  xxxd2203xxx  compared to that of  xxxd2215xxx  should result in a lower insulinreleasing activity in vitro and in vivo. as expected, in vivo in
dogs and in humans after a single or repeated administration,
in accordance with the reduced binding affinity,  xxxd2203xxx 
caused less insulin release than  xxxd2215xxx  (8, 20,34). however, in vitro in the isolated perfused rat pancreas as well as in

perifused islets of rats (fig.2) and mice (29),  xxxd2203xxx  released dose- and glucose-dependently more or at least as much
insulin as  xxxd2215xxx . the missing positive correlation of
depolarization and insulin releasing activity in vitro is not
based on differences in protein binding between  xxxd2203xxx 
and  xxxd2215xxx . the free concentrations of both drugs are
comparable with more than 99 % being bound to serum proteins or albumin (jantz et al., company reports, 1996). thus,
the divergency of  xxxd2203xxx  action on the katp and insulin release in vitro remains to be elucidated.

provided the blood glucose decreasing activity of sulfonylureas
is based exclusively on the stimulation of insulin release, the

lower binding affinity, depolarization activity and insulin
secretion stimulating activity in vivo of  xxxd2203xxx  compared
to  xxxd2215xxx  should be reflected in a lower blood glucose
decreasing activity of  xxxd2203xxx . however, the overall blood
glucose decreasing activity of  xxxd2203xxx  in dogs, rabbits, mice
and rats is similar to or even higher than that of  xxxd2215xxx ,
raising the suspicion that  xxxd2203xxx  has an additional insulinindependent blood glucose decreasing activity (21).
