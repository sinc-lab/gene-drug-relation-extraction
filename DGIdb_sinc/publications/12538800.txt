abstract
two  xxxg487xxx  (comt) inhibitors,  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx , were compared in the rat to elucidate the
actual differences between their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after single and repeated administration. their
inhibitory potencies were also compared in vitro. after intravenous administration (3 mg/kg), the elimination half-life (t1/2␤) of
 xxxd2000xxx  (0.8 h) was clearly shorter than that of  xxxd3395xxx 
(2.9 h). the striatum/serum ratio of  xxxd3395xxx  was 3-fold higher
than that of  xxxd2000xxx . after a single oral dose (10 mg/kg),
both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  produced an equal maximal
degree of comt inhibition in peripheral tissues, but  xxxd3395xxx 
inhibited striatal comt more effectively than did  xxxd2000xxx .
after the 7-day treatment (10 mg/kg twice daily), comt activity
had recovered to a level of 67 to 101% of control within 8 h after

the
second-generation
 xxxg487xxx 
(comt,  xxxg487xxx ) inhibitors,  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx ,
are indicated as adjuncts to standard levodopa- xxxg618xxx  inhibitor therapy in parkinson’s disease. they increase the bioavailability of levodopa by inhibiting its peripheral metabolism to an inactive metabolite, 3-o-methyldopa.
comt inhibitors improve the efficacy of the levodopa-dopa
decarboxylase inhibitor therapy by prolonging the duration
of action and the clinical benefit of levodopa (männistö and
kaakkola, 1999; kaakkola, 2000).
 xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  apparently behave differently
both in experimental animals and humans. however, as a rule,
 xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  have been studied only individually;
their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have not been
compared thoroughly after single and repeated dosing. actuthis work was supported in part by the drug research foundation (finnish
pharmacological society).

the last dose of  xxxd2000xxx . in  xxxd3395xxx -treated animals,
there was still extensive comt inhibition present in peripheral
tissues, and the degree of inhibition was higher than that attained after a single dose. the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling revealed that a plateau of comt inhibition near
the maximal attainable inhibition was reached already by
plasma concentrations below 2000 ng/ml, both with  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx .  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  inhibited
equally rat liver comt in vitro with ki values of 10.7 and 10.0
nm, respectively. in conclusion,  xxxd3395xxx  has a longer duration of action and a better brain penetration than  xxxd2000xxx .
the results also suggest that peripheral comt is inhibited
continuously when  xxxd3395xxx  is dosed at 12-h intervals, but this
was not seen with  xxxd2000xxx .

ally, very little is known about their pharmacodynamics in
different tissues after repeated dosing. furthermore, only the
relationship between the plasma drug concentration and
comt activity in erythrocytes has been studied previously
(dingemanse et al., 1995, 1996; forsberg et al., 2002).
a few available studies on  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  in
rats suggest that  xxxd2000xxx  is eliminated faster than  xxxd3395xxx  and its oral bioavailability is lower than that of  xxxd3395xxx . after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg  xxxd3395xxx , the t1/2 was 0.9 h and total clearance 470 ml ⫻ h⫺1 ⫻
kg⫺1. the oral bioavailability was 48% for 20 mg/kg and 56%
for 40 mg/kg (funaki et al., 1994, 1995). after administration
of 5.7 mg/kg  xxxd2000xxx  intravenously, the t1/2 and total
clearance were 0.4 h and 829 ml ⫻ h⫺1 ⫻ kg⫺1, respectively.
the oral bioavailability of  xxxd2000xxx  (5.7 mg/kg) seems to
depend on the  xxxd2000xxx  formulation; a bioavailability of
only about 10% is seen after administration of suspension,
but about 35% has been achieved by giving  xxxd2000xxx  as a
solution (savolainen et al., 2000).

comparison of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  in the rat

materials and methods
drugs and reagents
 xxxd2000xxx  was obtained from orion pharma (espoo, finland).
 xxxd3395xxx  was synthesized by dr. aino pippuri (orion pharma,
espoo, finland). for intravenous administration,  xxxd2000xxx  and
 xxxd3395xxx  were dissolved in phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). the  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  suspensions for oral administration were pre-

pared by mixing an appropriate amount of drug in potassium biphthalate buffer (ph 3.0, usp 23).
3,4- xxxd30xxx , s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx , edta disodium salt (na2-edta), vanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic
acid), isovanillic acid (3-hydroxy- xxxd2820xxx ), and mops
were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo).  xxxd3253xxx  was
purchased from  xxxg257xxx  laboratory supplies (poole, dorset, uk), dithiothreitol from merck (darmstadt, germany), and mgcl2 from
riedel-de haën (seelze, germany). all chemicals were reagent
grade. ultrapure water was produced with a maxima hplc unit
(elga labwater, high wycombe, buckinghamshire, uk).

animals
male han/wistar rats, supplied by the national laboratory animal centre (kuopio, finland), were housed in stainless steel cages
and kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lights on  xxxd2274xxx :00 am) at an
ambient temperature of 22 ⫾ 1°c. pelleted food (lactamin r36;
lactamin ab, södertälje, sweden) and tap water were available ad
libitum. animals were fasted before the administration of a single
dose and before the last dose of the 7-day treatment. animals were 8
to 9 weeks old and weighed 169 to 305 g (n ⫽ 168). in the intravenous
study, 26 animals were used. ten untreated rats (aged 11–12 weeks)
weighing 277 to 370 g were sacrificed to obtain liver samples for the
in vitro studies.
all procedures with animals were reviewed and approved by the
animal ethics committee at the university of kuopio in conformance with current legislation.

drug administration and sampling
intravenous administration. the rats were anesthetized with
chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg i.p., given as a dilute solution of 1 ml/100
g). vasodilatation of tail veins was induced by placing the rat’s tail in
a water bath (⫹40°c) for 2 min, and then a 5-s bolus injection of
 xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx  (3 mg/kg) was given via a tail vein. drugs
were administered on a mass basis since this has been standard
practice in most animal studies and in all human studies. if the doses
are converted to moles per kilogram, the dose of  xxxd2000xxx  (10
␮mol/kg) is approximately 10% lower than that of  xxxd3395xxx  (11
␮mol/kg). this difference, slightly favoring  xxxd3395xxx , was considered insignificant in this comparative study.
before injection, a blood sample (250 ␮l) was taken from the
retrobulbar plexus using nonheparinized glass capillaries. the following blood samples were taken at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, or 120 min after
the injection of the comt inhibitor. maximally, three retrobulbar
samples were taken from one rat, and the final sample was collected
after decapitation. sampling times were randomized between successive rats. the blood was allowed to clot and serum was separated
by centrifugation. the samples were kept frozen until analyzed.
for determination of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  concentrations in
the perfused striatum, the blood samples were taken from the retrobulbar plexus at 14 min and 59 min after the intravenous injection
of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  (3 mg/kg). after the 14-min blood sample, the thorax was opened, and 0.9% saline infusion was started via
the left ventricle using a large needle. simultaneously, the right
auricle was cut open and the blood was drained out. after 3 min of
perfusion, the outcoming fluid was clear. the rats were decapitated
and the striata were dissected.
oral administration. in the single-dose study,  xxxd2000xxx  or
 xxxd3395xxx  (10 mg/kg, equivalent to 33 ␮mol/kg  xxxd2000xxx  and 37
␮mol/kg  xxxd3395xxx ) was given orally as a suspension (ph 3.0) to rats
(n ⫽ 6 in each group). in the 7-day treatment study,  xxxd2000xxx  or
 xxxd3395xxx  (10 mg/kg) was administered repeatedly at 12-h intervals.
drugs were given by gavage in a volume of 0.5 ml/100 g animal
weight. controls received 0.5 ml/100 g potassium biphthalate buffer
(ph 3.0).
animals were decapitated 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after administration of a single dose or after the last dose of the 7-day treatment.

been studied in experimental animals after oral administration of  xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx  but at very different doses
(zürcher et al., 1990b, 1991; nissinen et al., 1992). these
previous results suggest that  xxxd3395xxx  generally has a
longer duration of action, but the pharmacodynamic properties of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  have been compared generally only in one single-dose (30 mg/kg) study published during the preparation of this article (learmonth et al., 2002).
on the basis of comt inhibitor studies in experimental
animals, it has been proposed that  xxxd3395xxx  penetrates to
the brain, whereas  xxxd2000xxx  has a mainly peripheral action (zürcher et al., 1991; kaakkola and wurtman, 1992;
männistö et al., 1992; nissinen et al., 1992), but to date,
there are no numeric data based on actual drug concentrations.
in healthy volunteers the elimination half-life (t1/2␤) of
 xxxd3395xxx  (1.3 h) is clearly longer than that of  xxxd2000xxx  (0.4
h), and the total clearance of  xxxd3395xxx  (7.1 l/h) is much
smaller than that of  xxxd2000xxx  (51.9 l/h) (jorga et al., 1998;
heikkinen et al., 2001). at therapeutic oral doses, both drugs
are rapidly eliminated with an apparent t1/2 of 1.6 to 3.4 h,
but  xxxd3395xxx  generally has a longer duration of action as
assessed by inhibition of comt activity in erythrocytes
(keränen et al., 1994; dingemanse et al., 1995). these apparent differences in the duration of action of  xxxd2000xxx  and
 xxxd3395xxx  have led to different treatment strategies;  xxxd2000xxx  is recommended to be given with each dose of levodopa,
whereas  xxxd3395xxx  is given three times a day in an attempt to
keep comt continuously inhibited (männistö and kaakkola,
1999).
in this study, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
properties of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  were compared in the
rat to elucidate actual differences in their behavior. first, 3
mg/kg of each drug was given intravenously to determine the
basic pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  and to assess their penetration into the brain by actual
drug concentrations. second,  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  (10
mg/kg) were given orally either once or repeatedly every 12 h
for 7 days to assess the differences in their pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics, both in the periphery and the central nervous system. furthermore, the relationship between
plasma drug concentration and comt activity in different
tissues was studied with the inhibitory emax model. finally,
the in vitro potencies of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  were compared under equal conditions using a low concentration of rat
liver comt. the ic50 values observed for tight binding inhibitors, such as  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx , vary with the
total enzyme concentration at a fixed substrate concentration
(lotta et al., 1995; borges et al., 1997; copeland, 2000).
therefore, the enzyme concentration in the sample must be
taken into consideration when ic50 or ki is determined
(copeland, 2000).

blood samples were taken in tubes containing na2-edta and
plasma was separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 1500g at ⫹4°c.
the plasma samples were transferred into plastic tubes and stored
at ⫺70°c until analyzed. after dissection, the tissue samples (striatum, duodenum, cortical part of the kidney, liver) were frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at ⫺70°c until assayed. the duodenum
samples were rinsed with 0.9% nacl to remove intestinal contents
and the unabsorbed drugs from the lumen.

inhibition of rat liver comt in vitro

determination of comt activity
the comt activity assay was performed according to the method
described by reenilä et al. (1995) for rat striatal samples. in brief,
tissue samples were homogenized in a mops buffer (ph 7.4) containing 0.32 m  xxxd3253xxx  and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. homogenates
were centrifuged for 10 min at 900g at ⫹4°c, and the supernatants
were used as the enzyme preparation containing both s- and mbcomt isoforms (i.e., total comt). the supernatants of kidney and
liver homogenates were first diluted with homogenization buffer.
a total of 100 ␮l of the enzyme preparation (total comt,  xxxg487xxx ,
or  xxxg487xxx ) was incubated for 30 min at ⫹37°c in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) containing 200 ␮m s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx , 5
mm mgcl2, and 240 ␮m 3,4- xxxd30xxx  (the substrate) in
a total volume of 250 ␮l. in comt inhibition experiments in vitro,
varying concentrations (3 ⫻ 10⫺11 to 3 ⫻ 10⫺5 m, final concentrations) of  xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx  were added to the incubation medium. when determining km and vmax values, the 3,4- xxxd30xxx  concentration was varied from 60 to 420 ␮m.
the reaction was stopped by transferring the samples to an ice
bath and by adding 25 ␮l of ice-cold 4 m perchloric acid. after 10 min,
the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 5400g at ⫹4°c. the
supernatants were filtered, diluted (1:10) with ultrapure water, and
stored at ⫺70°c until analyzed.
the reaction products (vanillic and isovanillic acid) were quantitated according to the method of reenilä et al. (1995). only minor
modifications were made to optimize the chromatographic separation and the detection of the analytes. briefly, 10 ␮l of the diluted

validation of comt assay
the linearity of vanillic acid production was followed as a function
of time up to 70 min with rat striatum, duodenum, kidney, and liver
total comt preparation, and all comt preparations used in in vitro
experiments. the reaction was highly linear (r ⬎ 0.98) at least up to
50 min in all cases. within-day and between-day coefficient of variation, calculated from repeated determinations of comt activity of
liver sample pool, were 7.6% (n ⫽ 14) and 9.4 to 14.5% (n ⫽ 28),
respectively.

determination of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx 
concentrations in plasma, serum, and striatal
homogenates
 xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  concentrations in rat plasma after oral
administration were determined as previously described (savolainen
et al., 2000). only minor modifications were made to optimize chromatographic separation. the agilent hplc 1100 series chromatographic system (agilent technologies inc., wilmington, de) consisted of a binary gradient pump, a vacuum degasser, an
autosampler, a thermostatted column compartment, a diode-array
detector, and agilent chemstation software (agilent technologies
inc., wilmington, de). the separation was performed with a zorbax
sb-c18 reversed-phase column (150 ⫻ 4.6 mm, 5 ␮m) with a guard
cartridge (12.5 ⫻ 4.6 mm) purchased from agilent technologies.
 xxxd2000xxx  was detected at 304 nm and  xxxd3395xxx  at 280 nm.
serum and striatal homogenate concentrations of  xxxd2000xxx  and
 xxxd3395xxx  after intravenous administration were determined according to the method described by karlsson and wikberg (1992) for
 xxxd2000xxx . only minor modifications were made in the sample
volumes. in brief, 100 ␮l of phosphate buffer (ph 7.2) were added to
200 ␮l of serum. after mixing, the sample was acidified with 100 ␮l
of 1 m hcl, and the analytes were extracted from the serum into 5.0
ml of n-hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) by mixing for 2 min. after
centrifugation, 4.0 ml of the organic phase were evaporated and the
residue was dissolved in 200 ␮l of mobile phase. the striata were
homogenized in 500 ␮l of 50 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.2) and then
treated as the serum samples.

calculations and statistics
animal studies. specific comt activities were transformed as
percentages of control (mean ⫾ s.e.m.). for calculation of area under
the effect-time curve (aue), the percentages of comt inhibition
were calculated by the equation (baseline activity ⫺ activity)/baseline activity ⫻ 100%. aue and area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (auc) values (% ⫻ h and ng ⫻ h ⫻ ml⫺1, respectively) from 0 to 8 h after dosing  xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx  orally were

to compare the inhibitory potency of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx 
against the rat liver comt, three sets of experiments were carried
out. first, rat liver total comt was incubated in the presence of
varying concentrations of  xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx  and the ic50 value
was determined. the amount of protein used was the same as in the
determination of comt activity of liver samples. second, the apparent inhibitor constant (kiapp) and the active enzyme concentration
were determined. also, km and maximum reaction velocity (vmax) of
rat liver total comt were measured. finally, the ic50 values of
 xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  were also compared using soluble (scomt) and membrane-bound ( xxxg487xxx ) comt preparations. the
effect of 60 min of preincubation at room temperature on the ic50
values was also investigated.
liver samples taken from 10 untreated animals were homogenized in a mops buffer (ph 7.4) containing 0.32 m  xxxd3253xxx  and
0.5 mm dithiothreitol. homogenates were fractionated according to
the method of nissinen et al. (1988) and ellingson et al. (1999).
briefly, the first halves of the homogenates were centrifuged for 10
min at 900g at ⫹4°c and the supernatants were pooled. after dilution, the 900g supernatant containing both s- and  xxxg487xxx  isoforms was used as a total comt preparation (total protein concentration ⬃0.7 mg/ml). the other halves of the homogenates were
centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000g, and the supernatants were centrifuged further for 60 min at 100,000g at ⫹4°c. high-speed supernatants, enriched with  xxxg487xxx , were pooled, diluted, and used as a
 xxxg487xxx  preparation (total protein concentration ⬃0.3 mg/ml). the
microsomal fraction enriched with  xxxg487xxx  was washed twice,
resuspended in homogenization buffer, and used as a  xxxg487xxx 
preparation (total protein concentration ⬃5.5 mg/ml).

samples were injected into a hplc system which consisted of an
isocratic waters 510 pump (waters, milford, ma), a waters 717 plus
autosampler with cooler (waters), a purospher rp-18e 4 ⫻ 125 mm
column with purospher rp-18e 4 ⫻ 4 mm precolumn (merck), esa
coulochem 5100a electrochemical detector (esa, chelmsford, ma),
and shimadzu c-r6b chromatopac integrator (shimadzu, kyoto,
japan). the detector was equipped with a 5021 conditioning cell and
a two-channel (det 1 and det 2) 5011 analytical cell. the potentials
applied were ⫹0.47, ⫹0.20, and ⫺0.25 v for conditioning cell, det 1,
and det 2, respectively. the sensitivity of det 2 was set at 12 ⫻ 100.
the mobile phase consisted of 0.1 m disodium hydrogen phosphate,
0.15 mm na2-edta, and 15% methanol (v/v). the ph was adjusted
to 3.2 with phosphoric acid. the flow rate was set at 1.1 ml/min.
the concentrations of both vanillic acid and isovanillic acid in the
samples were calculated from peak heights utilizing a standard
curve constructed by linear regression. the protein contents of the
samples were measured spectrophotometrically with hitachi u-2000
spectrophotometer (hitachi, tokyo, japan) using a bio-rad protein
assay kit (bio-rad, hercules, ca). specific comt activities were
expressed as pmol vanillic acid ⫻ min⫺1 ⫻ mg protein⫺1.

where v0 and vi are the reaction velocities in the absence and presence of the inhibitor i, respectively, to vi/v0 versus inhibitor concentration plot (copeland, 2000, p. 311). total comt activity was plotted as a function of substrate concentration, and km and vmax of total
comt were determined by nonlinear regression using the henrimichaelis-menten equation. inhibitor constant (ki) was calculated
from the equation kiapp ⫽ ki(1 ⫹ [s]/km), where s is the substrate

used to describe the relationship between plasma drug concentration
(c) and comt activity in peripheral tissues (e) after oral administration of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  (holford and sheiner, 1981;
dingemanse et al., 1995; forsberg et al., 2002). the specific comt
activities (pmol vanillic acid ⫻ min⫺1 ⫻ mg protein⫺1) were plotted
against corresponding concentration values (ng/ml); the baseline
comt activity (e0), maximum attainable comt inhibition (emax),
and the concentration producing 50% of the maximum attainable
inhibition (ec50) were fitted as free parameters; and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated using graphpad prism 3.02 software.
the statistical significance of differences between comt activity
profiles (from 0.5 to 8 h) and plasma drug levels (from 0.5 to 6 h) after
oral administration of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  were tested using
two-way factorial analysis of variance after logarithmic transformation. also, the effect of the 7-day treatment on comt activity profile
and plasma drug levels was tested (single dose versus 7-day treatment). the time required for full recovery of comt activity was
predicted by linear regression from log-transformed data (0.5– 8 h).
an independent-samples t test was applied to test the significance of
differences in maximal effects.
in vitro studies. the comt activities measured in the presence
of varying concentrations of  xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx  were plotted

these results are based on the direct assays of the drug in

discussion
the results of this comparative study indicate that  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  behave differently in rats. after intravenous administration,  xxxd2000xxx  was eliminated faster
than  xxxd3395xxx . after oral administration, significantly
higher plasma levels and a higher auc value were attained
with  xxxd3395xxx  than with  xxxd2000xxx , a reflection not only of
the better bioavailability but also the slower elimination of
 xxxd3395xxx . these results are in parallel with human studies
(keränen et al., 1994; jorga et al., 1998; heikkinen et al.,
2001).
after a single dose, the comt activity recovered faster in
the peripheral tissues of  xxxd2000xxx -treated animals, which
mirrors the plasma concentration data. it was estimated that
in  xxxd3395xxx -treated animals, contrary to  xxxd2000xxx -treated

animals, comt activity did not recover fully within 12 h,
suggesting that the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3395xxx  will become
intensified during repeated administration at 12-h dosing
intervals. very recently, also, learmonth et al. (2002) have
reported in the rat that at a dose of 30 mg/kg,  xxxd2000xxx  has
a shorter duration of action than  xxxd3395xxx .
interestingly, the maximal degree of comt inhibition
achieved by a single  xxxd3395xxx  dose was at the same level as
that reported after administration of a 10-fold higher dose
but at a higher level than that reported after 15 ␮mol/kg
(equivalent to 4 mg/kg) (zürcher et al., 1990b, 1991). furthermore, the comt activity in the liver recovered in the
same way after administration of 10 mg/kg as after 100
mg/kg, but more slowly than after 4 mg/kg (zürcher et al.,
1990b, 1991). these results suggest that oral  xxxd3395xxx  doses

above 10 mg/kg are beneficial only in prolonging the duration
of its inhibitory action.
the present plasma drug concentration data did not indicate accumulation with repeated dosing with 12-h intervals.
in  xxxd3395xxx -treated animals, however, the higher degree of
comt inhibition and the slower recovery of comt activity
after the last dose of the 7-day treatment than seen after the
single dose may indicate accumulation of  xxxd3395xxx  in the
kidney and liver. this phenomenon was not observed in
 xxxd2000xxx -treated animals. these results also indicate that
when 10 mg/kg  xxxd3395xxx  is administered at 12-h intervals,
the comt activity is continuously inhibited in the peripheral
tissues.
also, in single-dose (100 or 200 mg) human studies,  xxxd3395xxx  has a much longer duration of action than  xxxd2000xxx ;
the comt activity of erythrocytes has fully recovered within
8 h after dosing  xxxd2000xxx , whereas after administration of
 xxxd3395xxx , the inhibition lasted for over 12 h (keränen et al.,
1994; dingemanse et al., 1995). during repeated administration of  xxxd2000xxx  (rouru et al., 1999) or  xxxd3395xxx  (dingemanse et al., 1996), no change was observed in their pharmacodynamics. however,  xxxd3395xxx  seemed to accumulate at
doses above 200 mg t.i.d. (dingemanse et al., 1996).
the  xxxd2000xxx  regimen is designed to inhibit comt only
when levodopa is present. a continuous or at least longerlasting comt inhibition, such as that seen with the  xxxd3395xxx  regimen, would theoretically be more harmful than the
 xxxd2000xxx  regimen since continuous comt inhibition may
affect, for example, the metabolism of dietary catechols and
catecholestrogens (männistö and kaakkola, 1999). it could
be argued that it is preferable to allow the comt activity to
recover between levodopa doses. we are not aware of clear
evidence why continuous comt inhibition would produce
additional benefits in the levodopa therapy of parkinson’s
disease.
the ec50 value of  xxxd2000xxx  estimated by the inhibitory
emax model appeared to be lower than that of  xxxd3395xxx  in all
tissues. however, the slight difference may result simply
from the different distribution of observations and cannot be

considered significant due to the overlapping 95% confidence
intervals in most tissues. besides, in the present study, utilizing animal data without individual plasma drug concentration-time and comt activity profiles, the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship could be studied only by
using group data. furthermore, the trend to lower ec50
values after the 7-day treatment in the  xxxd3395xxx  group can
only be viewed as supporting the accumulation hypothesis in
tissues.
most importantly, the emax modeling revealed that a plateau of comt inhibition near to emax is attained already by
plasma concentrations below 2000 ng/ml, with both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx . this result is in agreement with our
previous findings from  xxxd2000xxx  studies (forsberg et al.,
2002). first, in the case of  xxxd3395xxx , this suggests that the
maximal degree of inhibition in the periphery could be
reached already at a much lower dose. second, the maximum
plasma  xxxd2000xxx  concentration reached after oral administration of 10 mg/kg appears to be high enough to produce
the maximal achievable comt inhibition in peripheral tissues. this explains why both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  had
equal maximal effects in the periphery after a single dose.
the present results indicate that  xxxd3395xxx  penetrates better than  xxxd2000xxx  into the brain. the actual striatal  xxxd3395xxx  concentrations and the striatum/serum ratios after intravenous administration were about 3-fold higher compared
with the corresponding values of  xxxd2000xxx . furthermore,
 xxxd3395xxx  inhibited striatal comt more effectively than  xxxd2000xxx . our results agree with previous animal results
from comt inhibitor studies suggesting that  xxxd3395xxx  penetrates into the brain, whereas  xxxd2000xxx  has a mainly
peripheral action (zürcher et al., 1991; kaakkola and wurtman, 1992; männistö et al., 1992; nissinen et al., 1992;
copeland, 2000). additionally, the ability of  xxxd3395xxx  (200
mg) to inhibit central comt in humans has been demonstrated very recently using 18f-dopa positron emission tomography (ceravolo et al., 2002). however, it has not yet
been clarified whether central comt inhibition further potentiates the efficacy of levodopa but  xxxd3395xxx  given alone

lacks any antiparkinsonian effect both in rats (männistö,
1998) and in patients (hauser et al., 1998).
the published results on the physicochemical properties of
 xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  are scarce, but the higher lipophilicity of  xxxd3395xxx  is thought to make it more accessible to the
brain than  xxxd2000xxx  (dingemanse, 2000). according to our
recent experiments,  xxxd2000xxx  is more water-soluble and

has a lower apparent partition coefficient than  xxxd3395xxx  at
physiological ph (m. forsberg, m. huotari, j. savolainen,
and p. t. männistö, unpublished results, 2002). these differences explain to some extent the differences between the
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx .
there have been several separate studies assessing the in
vitro potency of  xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx  and inhibition kinetics of comt (schultz and nissinen, 1989; zürcher et al.,
1990b; nissinen et al., 1992; borges et al., 1997; vieiracoelho and soares-da-silva, 1999), but only three groups
have compared  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  under equal experimental conditions. according to learmonth et al. (2002)
 xxxd3395xxx  is more potent than  xxxd2000xxx  both against rat
brain and against liver comt. however, in that study, the
95% confidence intervals of the ic50 values overlapped. de
santi et al. (1998) reported unexpectedly that  xxxd2000xxx 
was a significantly more potent inhibitor against human
peripheral comt. on the other hand, the ki values of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  did not differ in human recombinant
 xxxg487xxx , but  xxxd3395xxx  had a lower ki in  xxxg487xxx  than did
 xxxd2000xxx  (lotta et al., 1995).
nitrocatechol-structured comt inhibitors have been
shown to be tight binding inhibitors (schultz and nissinen,
1989; lotta et al., 1995; borges et al., 1997) that bind to the
enzyme with such a high affinity that the amount of free
inhibitor molecules is significantly depleted by the formation
of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (copeland, 2000). the ic50
value observed for tight binding inhibitors varies with total
enzyme concentration at a fixed substrate concentration; i.e.,
the higher the enzyme concentration, the higher the observed
ic50 value. therefore, determination of ic50 and ki must
take into consideration the enzyme concentration in the sample (copeland, 2000). in our experiments, guided by this
knowledge,  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  had equal ic50 values
against rat liver total comt but also against  xxxg487xxx  and
 xxxg487xxx  fractions. the ki values of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  in liver total comt were equal and the same order of
magnitude as previously reported in separate studies using
rat liver comt (zürcher et al., 1990a; nissinen et al., 1992).
interestingly, the ec50 values in the liver are 8- to 30-fold
higher than the ic50 values in liver total comt. this gradient between in vitro and in vivo data may generally reflect
the poor intracellular penetration of these nitrocatecholstructured comt inhibitors. however, additional studies are
needed to confirm this finding.
in conclusion,  xxxd3395xxx  has a longer elimination half-life,
a longer duration of action, and a better brain penetration
than  xxxd2000xxx . our findings also indicate that peripheral
comt is inhibited continuously if  xxxd3395xxx  is given at 12-h
dosing intervals, but this was not seen with  xxxd2000xxx .
however, both drugs had equal maximal effects in the peripheral tissues at a single dose of 10 mg/kg and equivalent in
vitro potency against liver total comt. furthermore, the
emax modeling revealed that a plateau of comt inhibition
near to emax is attained already by plasma concentrations
below 2000 ng/ml, both with  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx . the
present results suggest that the differences in the duration of
action result from different pharmacokinetic behavior.
