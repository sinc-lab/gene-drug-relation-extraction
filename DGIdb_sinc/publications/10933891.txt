uncoupling proteins (ucps) are inner mitochondrial membrane transporters which act as pores for
h ⴙ ions, dissipating the electrochemical gradient that
develops during mitochondrial respiration at the expense of atp synthesis. we have studied the effects of
two fibrates,  xxxd331xxx  and wy-14,643, on ucp-3 and
ucp-2 mrna levels in primary monolayer cultures of
rat adipocytes and undifferentiated preadipocytes.
treatment with both ppar␣ activators for 24 h upregulated ucp-3 mrna levels. thus,  xxxd331xxx  treatment resulted in an 8-fold induction in ucp-3 mrna
levels in preadipocytes compared with the 3.5-fold induction observed in adipocytes. differences in the induction of ucp-3 between these cells correlated well
with the higher expression of ppar␣ and rxr␣ mrna
values in preadipocytes compared to adipocytes. wy14,643 caused similar effects on ucp-3 mrna expression. in contrast to ucp-3, ucp-2 mrna levels were
only slightly modified by  xxxd331xxx  in adipocytes.
the induction in ucp-3 expression was not accompanied by changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential of rat primary preadipocytes after  xxxd331xxx 
or wy-14,643 treatment. since it has been proposed
that ucp-3 could be involved in the regulation of the
use of  xxxd2154xxx  as fuel substrates, the ucp-3 induction achieved after  xxxd331xxx  and wy-14,643 treatment may indicate a higher oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx ,
limiting their availability to be stored as triglycerides.

uncoupling proteins (ucps) 2 are inner mitochondrial membrane transporters, which act as a pore for
h ⫹ ions dissipating the electrochemical gradient that
develops during mitochondrial respiration. as a result,
thermogenesis is increased while the efficiency of atp
synthesis is reduced (1). to date, four ucps have been
described, and, at least for the first three, some understanding of their biological function has been achieved.
ucp-1, which is expressed exclusively in brown adipose tissue (1–3), has a role in the regulation of energy
expenditure in mammals, and thus, transgenic mice
with ablated brown fat develop obesity and insulin
resistance (4). ucp-2 is widely expressed in many human and rat tissues, including white adipose tissue
and skeletal muscle, and its levels are altered in obesity (5), suggesting it could be involved in weight control. transcripts of the recently identified ucp-3 are
present in rat skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue and, to a lesser extent, in white adipose tissue,
preadipocytes, and heart (5–10). its expression is reg2

ulated by hormonal and dietary manipulations including fasting. similarly to ucp-1, ucp-3 was originally
implicated in thermogenesis, as it diminishes the mitochondrial membrane potential when expressed in
yeast or the c 2c 12 myoblast cell line (8, 11). however,
further studies are necessary to confirm this possibility, since the increase in plasma free  xxxd2154xxx  observed after fasting, a well-established condition of
suppressed thermogenesis (12), up-regulates ucp-3
mrna levels in skeletal muscle (13, 14) without modifying the mitochondrial membrane potential (15). the
molecular mechanism by which ffas activate the expression of ucp-3 mrna levels seems to involve peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (ppars). ligands of these receptors, which are also activated by
 xxxd2154xxx , increase ucp-3 mrna levels in muscle and
white adipose tissue (wat) (16 –18). furthermore,
three putative peroxisome proliferator response elements (ppres) have been found in the 5⬘ flanking
region of the human ucp-3 gene, pointing to the involvement of ppars in the expression of this gene (19).
fibrates are hypolipidemic drugs that achieve almost all their known effects through the activation of
the ppar␣ subtype. this nuclear receptor, after heterodimerization with retinoid x receptor (rxr), controls the transcription of several target genes involved
in liver lipid metabolism (20). we have reported that
 xxxd331xxx  increased mrna levels of ucp-3 in wat
(10), in spite of the low levels of ppar␣ present in this
tissue (21). here we examine the effects of two fibrates,
 xxxd331xxx  and wy-14,643, on ucp-3 and ucp-2
mrna levels in primary monolayer cultures of rat
adipocytes and undifferentiated preadipocytes. we report that treatment with both ppar␣ activators for
24 h up-regulated ucp-3 mrna levels. thus,  xxxd331xxx  caused an 8-fold induction in ucp-3 mrna levels in preadipocytes compared with the 3.5-fold induction observed in adipocytes. these differences between
cells correlated well with the higher expression of
ppar␣ and rxr␣ mrna levels in preadipocytes compared to adipocytes. wy-14,643 treatment showed similar effects. in contrast, ucp-2 mrna levels were only
slightly modified by  xxxd331xxx  in adipocytes. the increase in ucp-3 expression induced by  xxxd331xxx  and
wy-14,643 was not accompanied by a reduction in the
mitochondrial membrane potential of rat primary
preadipocytes. since ppar␣ activation has been reported to reduced body fat pads in rats (10, 22–25), the
ucp-3 induction achieved after  xxxd331xxx  and wy14,643 treatment may indicate a higher oxidation of
 xxxd2154xxx , limiting their availability to be stored as
triglycerides and leading to a reduced rate of conversion of preadipocytes to adipocytes, which directly affects fat depots.

materials and methods
materials.  xxxd331xxx  was from sigma (st. louis, mo), and
4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidine)(pyrimidinylthio)acetic acid (wy-14,643) was
from cayman chemicals (ann arbor, mi). troglitazone was a kind
gift of glaxo wellcome (uk).  xxxd331xxx  and troglitazone were dissolved in dmso and wy-14,643 in ethanol.
cell isolation and primary culture of rat preadipocytes and adipocytes. fibroblastic preadipocytes were isolated from adipose tissue
following robdell (26), with some modifications. the epididymal
adipose tissue from 200- to 250-g male sprague-dawley rats was
removed in sterile conditions and washed in hanks’ balanced salt
solution (hbss) (life technologies, gaithersburg, md). minced tissue was transferred to a sterile polypropylene erlenmeyer flask
containing collagenase (2 mg/ml, type ii, sigma) and 5% bovine
 xxxg124xxx . following incubation at 37°c for 45 min in a shaking
water bath, the digest was filtered through a sterile 250-␮m nylon
mesh. the digested tissue was then centrifuged at 250g for 10 min,
and mature adipocytes were removed by aspiration. the pellet was
resuspended in hbss, filtered through 25-␮m nylon mesh, and centrifuged again. the pellet obtained consisted mainly of preadipocytes. it was resuspended in mem alpha medium (life technologies) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and  xxxd164xxx  (100
units/ml, 100 ␮g/ml, and 2.5 ␮g/ml, respectively; life technologies),
and refiltered. to eliminate red blood cells, preadipocytes were incubated with an erythrocyte lysing buffer consisting of 0.154 m
nh 4cl, 10 mm khco 3, and 0.1 mm edta for 5 min at room
temperature. in these conditions, ⬎95% of red blood cells were lysed
without damaging the nucleus-containing cells as assessed by trypan
blue exclusion. the suspension was centrifuged (250g for 10 min),
and the cells were counted using a hemocytometer. cells were plated
in 60-mm culture dishes at a density of 1.5 ⫻ 10 5 cells/ml in mem
alpha medium with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs). cells were maintained in this medium until 80% confluence was reached (usually 2
days). preadipocytes were then treated in serum-free mem alpha
medium with vehicle (0.1% dmso or ethanol),  xxxd331xxx , or wy14,643 for 24 h. after the incubation, rna was extracted from the
preadipocytes as described below. at this step, differentiation of
preadipocytes was induced by the addition of medium supplemented
with  xxxd2388xxx  (0.5 mm), dexamethasone (0.25 ␮m),
and insulin (10 ␮g/ml). after 48 h, the induction medium was removed and replaced by mem alpha medium containing 10% fcs
and insulin (10 ␮g/ml). this medium was changed every 2 days. ten
days later, cells were regarded as differentiated by morphological
criteria when, after acquiring a round shape, their cytoplasm was
completely filled with multiple lipid droplets (assessed by oil red o
staining).
differentiated adipocytes in mem alpha medium were treated
with vehicle (0.1% dmso or ethanol),  xxxd331xxx , wy-14,643, or
troglitazone for 24 h. after the incubation, rna was extracted from
the adipocytes as described below.
rna preparation and analysis. total rna was isolated using the
ultraspec reagent (biotecx). relative levels of specific mrnas were
assessed by the reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr). complementary dna was synthesized from rna samples
by mixing 0.5 ␮g of total rna and 125 ng of random hexamers as
primers in the presence of 50 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 8.3), 75 mm
kcl, 3 mm mgcl 2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 u moloney murine
leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (life technologies), 20 u rnasin (life technologies), and 0.5 mm of each dntp (sigma) in a total
volume of 20 ␮l. samples were incubated at 37°c for 60 min. a 5-␮l
aliquot of the rt reaction was then used for subsequent pcr amplification with specific primers.
each 25-␮l pcr reaction contained 5 ␮l of the rt reaction, 1.2 mm
mgcl 2, 200 ␮m dntps, 1.25 ␮ci [ 32p] xxxd1148xxx  (3000 ci/mmol, amersham), 1 unit of taq polymerase (ecogen, barcelona, spain), 0.5 ␮g

annealing, cdna and taq polymerase were separated from primers
and dntps by using a layer of paraffin (reaction components contact
only when paraffin fuses, at 60°c). the sequences of the sense and
antisense primers used for amplification were ucp-3, 5⬘-ggagccatggcagtgacctgt-3⬘ and 5⬘-tgtgatgttgggccaagtccc-3⬘; ucp-2, 5⬘-aacagttctacaccaagggc-3⬘ and 5⬘-agcatggtaagggcacagtg-3⬘; ppar␣, 5⬘-ggctcggagggctctgtcatc-3⬘ and 5⬘-acatgcactggcagcagtgga-3⬘; rxr␣,
5⬘-gctctccaacgggtcgaggct-3⬘ and 5⬘-tgggtgtggtgggtaccgaca-3⬘;  xxxg179xxx  (adenosyl phosphoribosyl transferase), 5⬘agcttcccggacttccccatc-3⬘ and 5⬘-gaccactttctgccccggttc-3⬘. the  xxxg179xxx  gene was used as internal control in the pcr
to normalize the results, except for ucp-3, where co-amplifications
for this gene and  xxxg179xxx  were performed in separate tubes and in
duplicate. pcr was performed in an mj research thermocycler
equipped with a peltier system and temperature probe. after an
initial denaturation for 1 min at 94°c, pcr was performed for 23
(ucp-2, ppar␣, and rxr␣) or 30 (ucp-3) cycles. each cycle consisted of denaturation at 92°c for 1 min, primer annealing at 60°c,
and primer extension at 72°c for 1 min and 50 s. a final 5-min
extension step at 72°c was performed. five microliters of each pcr
sample was electrophoresed on a 1-mm-thick 5% polyacrylamide gel.
the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using kodak
x-ray films to show the amplified dna products. amplification of
each gene yielded a unique band of the expected size (ucp-3, 179 bp;
ucp-2, 471 bp; ppar␣, 654 bp; rxr␣, 202 bp;  xxxg179xxx , 329 bp).
preliminary experiments were carried out with various amounts of
cdna to determine nonsaturating conditions of pcr amplification
for all the genes studied. thus cdna amplification was performed in
comparative and semiquantitative conditions. radioactive bands
were quantified by video-densitometric scanning (vilbert lourmat
imaging). the results for the expression of specific mrnas are always presented relative to the expression of the control gene ( xxxg179xxx ).
analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry.
subconfluent preadipocytes treated with vehicle (0.1% dmso or
ethanol),  xxxd331xxx , or wy-14,643 for 24 h were washed,
trypsinized, and resuspended in hbss. cells were incubated at 37°c
for 30 min in the dark with 10 nm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester
(tmre, molecular probes, eugene, or) in the presence or in the
absence of the uncoupler carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone
(cccp, sigma) (75 ␮m). flow cytometry was carried out using an
epics xl flow cytometer (coulter corporation, hialeah, fl). excitation of the sample was performed using a standard 488-nm air-cooled
argon-ion laser at 15 mw. the instrument was set up with the
standard configuration. forward scatter (fsc), side scatter (ssc),
and orange (575 nm) fluorescence for tmre were acquired. orange
fluorescence was collected with a 600-nm dichroic long filter and a
575-nm band pass filter. optical alignment was based on the optimized signal from 10-nm fluorescent beads (immunocheck, epics
division). a minimum of 10,000 cells/sample were acquired and
analyzed.
statistical analyses. statistical significance was evaluated using
student’s t test or one-way anova.

results

in a previous study (10) we reported up-regulation of
ucp-3 mrna levels in epididymal wat of bezafibratetreated rats. for this reason, we first attempted to
demonstrate a direct effect of  xxxd331xxx  on ucp-3
expression in a primary culture of adipocytes. fibroblastic preadipocytes were induced to differentiate to
adipocytes. differentiation was assessed by morphological criteria and by the expression of ob mrna, which
was not present in preadipocytes (data not shown).

since adipocytes express low levels of ppar␣ and high
levels of ppar␥ (27), and since the latter can also be

using wy-14,643  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m, a concentration that activates only the ppar␣ subtype (28). treatment with 10

ucp-3 mrna levels, showing that ppar␣ activation
was involved in ucp-3 up-regulation. as previously
reported (17), treatment of primary culture of adipocytes with 5 ␮m troglitazone, a ppar␥ agonist, caused
a 2.4-fold increase in ucp-3 mrna levels.  xxxd331xxx 
treatment also increased ucp-2 mrna levels (1.5-fold
induction, p ⫽ 0.001, n ⫽ 3) (fig. 1b), although to a
lesser extent than ucp-3. in contrast, neither wy14,643 nor troglitazone modified the mrna levels of
this ucp subtype.
since preadipocytes express ucp-3 and ucp-2 (29),
we further studied the effects of the ppar␣ activators,
 xxxd331xxx  and wy-14,643, on these cells. treatment
of the primary culture of preadipocytes with 500 ␮m
 xxxd331xxx  for 24 h caused an 8-fold induction (p ⫽
0.003, n ⫽ 3) in the levels of ucp-3 mrna (fig. 2a).
likewise, addition of wy-14,643 to preadipocytes at
concentrations 10 and 50 ␮m up-regulated ucp-3
mrna levels 3.3-fold (p ⫽ 0.04, n ⫽ 3) and 7-fold
(p ⫽ 0.001, n ⫽ 3), respectively. in contrast, treatment with either ppar␣ agonist did not significantly
modify ucp-2 mrna levels (fig. 2b).
to gain further insight into the mechanism responsible for the higher induction in ucp-3 mrna levels in
preadipocytes than in adipocytes, we determined the
mrna expression of ppar␣ and rxr␣ in both cell
types. at the mrna level, preadipocytes expressed
1.3-fold more ppar␣ (p ⫽ 0.017, n ⫽ 3) (fig. 3a) and
1.6-fold more rxr␣ (p ⫽ 0.0007, n ⫽ 3) than adipocytes (fig. 3b).
finally, we studied whether the up-regulation of
ucp-3 mrna levels caused by  xxxd331xxx  and wy14,643 in preadipocytes was correlated with a change
in the mitochondrial membrane potential analyzed by
flow cytometry (fig. 4). the fluorescence intensity of
the dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (tmre) has
been used as an indicator of mitochondrial membrane
potential (9). this fluorescent dye is sensitive to the
mitochondrial potential and, therefore, to the electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial inner
membrane. in this study, we used as a positive control
carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (cccp), a
very effective uncoupler of mitochondria, which decreases the fluorescence emission. the cccp-dependent fluorescence is normally considered to derive from
the mitochondrial contribution. using confocal microscopy studies we confirmed that the fluorescence was
specifically localized in mitochondria of the preadipocytes (data not shown), as previously described (9, 30).
neither 50 ␮m wy-14,643 nor 500 ␮m  xxxd331xxx  significantly modified the mitochondrial potential. the

discussion

in a previous study (10) we reported that treatment
of rats with  xxxd331xxx  for 3, 7, and 15 days led to the
up-regulation of ucp-3 mrna levels in epididymal
wat. these changes were accompanied by a reduction
in the weight of epididymal fat pads and in body weight

putative ppres have been found in the 5⬘ flanking
region of the human ucp-3 gene (19), converting
ucp-3 to a possible new ppar-target gene. therefore,
it seems likely that the induction of ucp-3 mrna
levels produced by fibrates and troglitazone in adipocytes is mediated by these transcription factors. in
contrast, ucp-2 mrna levels showed a weak induction after  xxxd331xxx  addition or no induction in wy14,643- or troglitazone-treated cells (fig. 1b). when we
examined the effects of  xxxd331xxx  and wy-14,643 on
ucp-3 mrna levels in preadipocytes, a stronger induction was observed than that found in adipocytes. at
the mrna level we detected higher expression of
ppar␣ and rxr␣ in preadipocytes than in adipocytes
(1.3- and 1.6-fold, respectively) (fig. 3), which correlates well with the differences found in the induction of
ucp-3.
regarding the consequences of the strong ucp-3
induction in preadipocytes, we should bear in mind
that, as stated above, induction in ucp-3 expression
may lead to the reduction of atp production in mitochondria. ucp-3 induction caused by  xxxd331xxx  may
reduce the amount of atp available for differentiation
of fibroblast-like preadipocytes into adipocytes. these
effects could explain the reductions in epididymal fat
pad weight and body weight observed in bezafibratetreated rats (10), which is consistent with the role of
ppar␣ in obesity (31). in fact, it is well documented
that the rate of conversion of preadipocytes to mature
adipocytes directly affects fat depots (32). this possibility is compatible with results reported by keller et
al. (1992). they found that urea synthesis, which is
highly dependent on atp supply, was almost totally

gain throughout the treatment. to further study the
effects of fibrates on ucp mrna expression, here we
used a primary culture of rat preadipocytes and adipocytes. we showed that two fibrates,  xxxd331xxx  and
wy-14,643, which elicit their effects through the activation of the ppar␣ subtype, increase ucp-3 mrna
levels in adipocytes and preadipocytes (figs. 1 and 2).
several lines of evidence indicate that ppar is involved in the control of ucp-3 expression. thus, both
ppar␣ and ppar␥ activators, including  xxxd2154xxx ,
up-regulate its expression (16 –18), and, recently, three

abolished in the perfused liver after chronic treatment
with wy-14,643, indicating that wy-14,643 diminished
atp supply. in addition, recent results involving
changes in ucp expression support this hypothesis.
thus,  xxxd2096xxx  administration to mice for 15 days
increased ucp-2 and ucp-3 mrna levels in liver (34).
however, analysis of the mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry showed no differences after
either  xxxd331xxx  or wy-14,643 treatment (fig. 4). the
lack of effect on the mitochondrial membrane potential
does not support the original role proposed for ucps.
the increased expression of ucp-3 achieved by ppar␣
activators should reduce the mitochondrial membrane
potential. there exists direct evidence for the uncoupling role of ucp-1 in bat, thus increasing thermogenesis (35). in contrast, the capacity of ucp-2 and
ucp-3 to uncouple relies on their high sequence homology to ucp-1, and experimental data come only
from the expression of exogenous genes in yeast or
mammalian cells (8, 11). in fact, there is a controversy
over whether ucps decrease mitochondrial membrane
potential. on the one hand, cadenas et al. (1999) recently reported that fasting increased ucp-2 and
ucp-3 mrna levels in rat skeletal muscle more than
5-fold and 4-fold, respectively, and ucp-3 protein levels 2-fold. however, proton conductance remained unchanged in isolated mitochondria. on the other hand,
mitochondria isolated from livers of ob/ob mice, with
higher ucp-2 mrna expression, showed an increased
rate of h ⫹ leak, which partially dissipates the mitochondrial membrane potential when the rate of electron transport is reduced (36). in addition, they reported that changes in the proton motive force in isolated mitochondria could only be demonstrated in
experimental conditions that limited the supply of electrons to the respiratory chain. similarly, these same
authors found that the physiological implications of
hepatic mitochondrial uncoupling (e.g., atp reduction)
appeared to depend on the balance between the availability of energy substrates and cell energy requirements.
further work is needed to elucidate the physiological
and biochemical functions of ucp-3 induction in preadipocytes and adipocytes. however, it has been proposed that ucp-3 could be specifically involved in the
regulation of the use of lipids as fuel substrates in cells
(13). if the hypothesis is confirmed, ucp-3 induction
would indicate a higher utilization of  xxxd2154xxx  as fuel
substrates, leading to a reduced availability of fatty
acids to be stored as triglycerides. as a result, the
conversion of preadipocytes to adipocytes would be reduced.
in summary, the present study shows that two fibrates,  xxxd331xxx  and wy-14,643, up-regulate ucp-3
mrna levels in preadipocytes and adipocytes. differences in the induction of ucp-3 between these cells

correlated well with the higher expression of ppar␣
and rxr␣ mrna values in preadipocytes compared to
adipocytes. ucp-3 induction after  xxxd331xxx  and wy14,643 may be involved in the fat pad reduction observed in rats treated with ppar␣ activators.
