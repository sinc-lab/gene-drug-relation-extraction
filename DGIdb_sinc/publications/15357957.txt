abstract—the four stereoisomers of  xxxd2580xxx  were synthesized and evaluated in d2, 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c, d1, and d3
receptor binding and functional assays. two isomers demonstrated potent  xxxg656xxx  binding (ki < 3 nm) and functional antagonism (ic50 6 10 nm) activities. these two isomers also showed moderate aﬃnity for the 5-ht2a and d3 receptors. a third isomer
was devoid of signiﬁcant  xxxg656xxx  binding, but did have moderate aﬃnity for the 5-ht2a and d3 receptors. the fourth isomer
demonstrated poor aﬃnity for all the receptors tested. most signiﬁcantly, the stereochemistry of the sulfoxide moiety played a
dominant role in the observed structure–activity relationship (sar).

before the advent of eﬃcient and economically viable
synthetic methods for the preparation of enantiomerically pure pharmaceutical agents many drugs were
introduced to patients in racemic form. however, with
tremendous advances in asymmetric synthesis and with
recognition that individual enantiomers could possess
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties a move to introduce
enantiomerically pure drugs began in earnest. similarly,
eﬀorts were initiated to replace currently marketed racemic drugs with enantiomerically pure forms. these
eﬀorts continue today.1 for example, the h+k+-atpase
inhibitor omeprazole, utilized for the treatment of gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (gerd), has been replaced
with its sulfoxide (s)-enantiomer esomeprazole resulting
in superior gastric-acid inhibition and clinical eﬃcacy.2

another compound whose enantiomers demonstrate
diﬀering biological activities is thioridazine, 1.3,4 it is a
member of the phenothiazine class of neuroleptic agents
used for the treatment of psychotic disorders, including
schizophrenia.5 the (r)-enantiomer has been shown to
have 2.7 times greater aﬃnity for the  xxxg656xxx  compared to the (s)-enantiomer, whereas the (s)-enantiomer
had ten times greater aﬃnity for the  xxxg655xxx .6

 xxxd2580xxx  ( xxxd2580xxx ) is another member of the phenothiazine class of antipsychotics and a
thioridazine analog.7 in addition, it is a metabolite of
thioridazine formed in several species, including
humans.8 the sulfoxide functionality in  xxxd2580xxx 
introduces an additional chiral center compared to thioridazine. therefore,  xxxd2580xxx  comprises a mixture
of four stereoisomers (2–5). herein we report the synthesis, receptor binding, and functional studies of these
individual stereoisomers.

also dramatically improved the selectivity of the reaction
and the product yield compared to the free bases presumably by reducing the chelating ability of the amine.
the diastereomeric purity of each isomer was further increased utilizing chiral stationary-phase hplc puriﬁcation giving 2–5 (free bases). the enantiomeric and
chemical purity of each isomer was greater than
98%.14–16 the sulfoxide stereochemical assignment was
based on literature precedence for ti(i-pro)4/h2o/
chp or t-buooh oxidation of other aryl methyl sulfoxides.13,17 finally, each diasteriomer was converted to its
corresponding oxalate salt for storage and biological
testing.

stationary-phase; (vi)  xxxd2802xxx  (1 equiv), et2o.

the isomers were prepared according to the method
outlined in scheme 1. racemic 1 was treated with ()menthyl chloroformate and diisopropylethylamine in
dichloromethane (dcm) to give a mixture of diastereomers 6 and 7 that were readily separated by column
chromatography.9 parenthetically, 1 could be demethylated in a two-step process utilizing 1-chloroethyl chloroformate and then the resulting amine converted to
carbamates 6 and 7.10 however, the direct conversion
of 1 to 6 and 7 was found to be quite eﬃcient. each carbamate was then reduced with lithium aluminum hydride (lah) to give (s)-1 and (r)-1, respectively.11
each enantiomer (as the corresponding hydrochloride
salt) was subsequently oxidized with cumene hydrogen
peroxide (chp) in the presence of ti(i-pro)4 and d or l -dimethyl tartrate in dcm at 20 c to yield  xxxd2580xxx  isomers.12 typically the oxidation reactions
proceeded with greater than 85% enantioselectivity as
assessed by hplc analysis. the d - and l -dimethyl tartrates gave the (s)- and (r)-sulfoxides, respectively.13
initially, diethyl tartrates were used, but the dimethyl
esters were found to give fewer side-products. two other
oxidants, ureaæh2o2 and (1r)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)oxaziridine, were also evaluated in place of chp
without success. utilizing the hydrochloride salts of 1

the  xxxd2580xxx  isomers 2–5 (oxalate salts) were evaluated in d2, 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c, d1, and  xxxg657xxx  binding assays.18 two isomers, 2 and 5, had
potent aﬃnity for the  xxxg656xxx  exhibiting kis at
the high aﬃnity binding site of 2.2 and 1.2 nm, respectively (table 1). both compounds exhibited biphasic
dose–response curves with hill coeﬃcients 0.3 suggesting diﬀerent binding aﬃnities to various states of the d2
receptor. addition of guanosine 5 0 -[c-thio]triphosphate
(gtpcs; 1 lm) had no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the hill coefﬁcients of the dose–response curves, indicative of receptor antagonists.19a although biphasic dose–response
curves are unusual for d2 antagonists, they are not
unprecedented.19b,c the other two isomers, 3 and 4,
had signiﬁcantly weaker aﬃnity for the  xxxg656xxx 
(ki > 300 nm). compound 2 also had moderate aﬃnity
for the 5-ht2a (ki = 55 nm) and d3 (ki = 23 nm) receptors. similarly, 5 had moderate aﬃnity for these two receptors (5-ht2a ki = 19 nm; d3 ki = 26 nm). in addition,
5 had moderate aﬃnity for the  xxxg1108xxx 
(ki = 64 nm). isomer 3 only had modest aﬃnity for the
5-ht2a (ki = 112 nm) and d3 (ki = 95 nm) receptors.
most interestingly, isomer 4 demonstrated relatively
poor aﬃnity (ki > 195 nm) for all the receptors tested
(table 2).
next, the  xxxd2580xxx  isomers were evaluated in functional assays (table 3).20 d1 agonism and antagonism
was determined using a  xxxd1773xxx  functional assay
in c6d1 low-density cells. d2 and d3 agonism was determined by stimulation of mitogenesis and antagonism
was measured by inhibition of quinpirole-induced mitogenesis in chop cells. 5-ht2a agonism and antagonism
were determined using the rat aorta spiral (ras) contraction assay.
isomers 2 and 5 (oxalate salts) exhibited potent d2 and
5-ht2a antagonism (2: d2 ic50 = 10 nm, 5-ht2a
ke = 7 nm; 5: d2 ic50 = 4 nm, 5-ht2a ke = 2.5 nm)
and moderate d3 antagonism (ic50 = 35 and 16 nm,

respectively). furthermore, both compounds were inactive in the d1, d2, or d3 agonism assays. isomer 3 was
also a 5-ht2a antagonist (ke = 28 nm), but isomer 4 was
devoid of any functional activity below 200 nm for all
the receptors tested in agreement with the receptor ligand binding studies.
given the eﬃcaciousness of  xxxd2580xxx , particularly
in refractory schizophrenics,21 while recognizing the desire to mitigate its potential cardiac side-eﬀects22 stemming from inhibition of human ether-a-go-go-related
gene (herg) potassium channels23 and extrapyramidal adverse eﬀects an investigation of the individual stereoisomers that comprise the currently available
formulation was warranted. based on the reported
structure–activity relationship (sar) for the enantiomers of thioridazine, 1, the chiral center in the piperidine
ring of  xxxd2580xxx  was anticipated to signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence its sar. however, most surprising was the
ﬁnding that the chirality at the sulfoxide moiety of  xxxd2580xxx  had a much more pronounced inﬂuence on the
sar of the individual isomers for  xxxg656xxx  binding
activity than the chiral center in the piperidine ring.
these results raise several interesting possibilities related
to mesorid- azines therapeutic eﬀects and observed toxicities. further studies of isomers 2–5 could reveal if the
observed in vivo eﬀects reported for  xxxd2580xxx  are
due to a repertoire of various stereoisomers or primarily
due to a single isomer. such a deconvolution may also
assist in a further understanding of the receptor binding
proﬁle of eﬀective anti-psychotic agents.24 likewise, the
associated toxicities of  xxxd2580xxx  could be evaluated
for each isomer in the hope that eﬃcacy and adverse effects diverge among the various stereoisomers.
 xxxd2580xxx  is classiﬁed as a typical anti-psychotic
agent. more recently developed compounds, referred
to as atypical agents (reportedly associated with fewer
extrapyramidal adverse eﬀects) have been introduced.
however, a recent study supports the eﬀectiveness and
pharmacoeconomic beneﬁts of the typical anti-psychotic agent haloperidol in combination with prophylactic benztropine compared with the atypical agent
olanzapine.25 such beneﬁts may similarly be realized

with a diastereo- and enantiomerically pure form of
 xxxd2580xxx .
in conclusion, the four stereoisomers of  xxxd2580xxx 
were synthesized from racemic thioridazine. each of
the isomers was evaluated in d2, 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a,
5-ht2c, d1, and  xxxg657xxx  binding and functional
assays. two isomers, 2 and 5, demonstrated potent d2
receptor binding and functional antagonism activities.
these two isomers also showed moderate aﬃnity for
the 5-ht2a and d3 receptors. a third isomer, 3, was devoid of signiﬁcant  xxxg656xxx  binding, but did have
moderate aﬃnity for the 5-ht2a and d3 receptors.
the fourth isomer, 4, demonstrated poor aﬃnity for
all the receptors tested. most signiﬁcantly, the stereochemistry of the sulfoxide moiety played a dominant
role in the observed sar.
