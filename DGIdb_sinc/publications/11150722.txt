interaction between factor viii and
 xxxg1318xxx -related protein
modulation of coagulation?
jaap g. neels, niels bovenschen, anton-jan van zonneveld,
and peter j. lenting*

recent reports suggest that the multifunctional receptor low-density
lipoprotein receptor-related protein (lrp) may contribute to the regulation of blood coagulation by mechanisms that differ from the simple
removal of protease/inhibitor complexes from the circulation. this possibility became apparent from the observation that lrp is involved in
down-regulation of  xxxg748xxx  expression at the surface of monocytes and fibroblasts. furthermore,  xxxg751xxx  and activated  xxxg752xxx  (factor ixa) have been identified as proteins that are
able to bind to lrp. in the present review, the potential contribution of
lrp to the regulation of the coagulation cascade through these novel
pathways is discussed, with particular reference to the interaction
between lrp and  xxxg751xxx . (trends cardiovasc med

bleeding tendencies associated with the
functional absence of  xxxg751xxx  are known as  xxxg751xxx 
(sadler and davie 1987). this disease,
which has been recognized for several
centuries, is an x-linked disorder affecting
1–2 in 10,000 males. the activated derivative of factor viii serves as a cofactor
for the  xxxg745xxx  factor ixa in the
 xxxg741xxx -activating complex of the intrinsic coagulation pathway (for recent
reviews on factor viii see kaufman et
al. 1997, lenting et al. 1998).
tcm vol. 10, no. 1, 2000

the gene of factor viii is located at
the tip of the long arm of the x chromosome and spans over 180 kb, comprising
26 exons that encode a polypeptide
chain of 2351 amino acids. the polypeptide includes a signal peptide of 19 and a
mature protein of 2332 amino acids.
analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a discrete domain
structure within factor viii. based on
internal homology, these domains are
arranged in the sequence a1-a1-a2-a2b-a3-a3-c1-c2 (figure 1). the a domains
display approximately 30% homology to
each other, and to homologous a domains found in the copper-binding protein  xxxg500xxx  and  xxxg749xxx . the a domains are bordered by
short segments (a1, a2 and a3) that are
enriched in glutamate and aspartate residues, the so-called acidic regions. factor viii c domains are structurally related to those present in factor v, and
various other proteins such as the lipidbinding lectin discoidin i. the b domain

is unique in that it exhibits no significant
homology with any other known protein.
owing to endoproteolytic processing,
factor viii circulates in plasma predominantly as a heterodimeric protein
consisting of a metal ion-linked heavy
and light chain (figure 1). the heavy
chain (90–220 kda) contains the a1-a1a2-a2-b domains and is heterogeneous
as a result of limited proteolysis within
the b domain. the light chain (80 kda)
comprises the domains a3-a3-c1-c2. in
plasma, factor viii is present as an inactive precursor that is tightly associated
with its carrier protein von willebrand
factor (vwf) through the amino- and
carboxyterminal ends of factor viii light
chain. factor viii is converted into its active form by thrombin-mediated proteolysis in both factor viii heavy chain and
light chain. the light chain is cleaved
between the a3 and a3 domain, while
the heavy chain is cleaved between the a1
and a2 domain and between the a2 and b
domain. the final activated product, fac-

metal ion-dependent interaction between the a1 and a3 domains. the heavy chain contains
the a1-a1-a2-a2-b domains and the light chain comprises the domains a3-a3-c1-c2. factor
viii is tightly associated with vwf through the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of factor
viii light chain. upon thrombin activation the factor viii heterodimer is cleaved in both
heavy and light chain (arrows) resulting in releases of the b domain and the a3 segment. removal of this a3 segment is associated with the loss of high-affinity binding to vwf. within

tor viiia, thus consists of the metal
ion-linked heterodimer a1-a1/a3-c1-c2
that is associated with the heavy chain
derived a2-a2 portion, whereas the b
domain and the a3 segment have been
removed (figure 1). release of this a3
segment is associated with the loss of
high-affinity binding to vwf. binding
of factor viii to vwf serves an important role in factor viii physiology. not
only is the factor viii heterodimeric
structure stabilized upon association, but
vwf also prevents factor viii from binding to other proteins. it has previously
been established that factor viii may
interact with a variety of proteins, including  xxxg1847xxx ,  xxxg741xxx 
and factor ixa. recently, factor viii
was shown to interact with the multifunctional receptor lrp as well (lenting et al.
1999a, saenko et al. 1999).
• low-density lipoprotein
receptor-related protein
lipoprotein receptor-related protein
(lrp), also known as the a2-macroglobulin receptor, is a 600-kda membrane
glycoprotein that is a member of the
low-density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor
family of endocytic receptors (for recent
reviews on lrp see gliemann 1998,
neels et al. 1998). this growing receptor
family includes the  xxxg1318xxx ,  xxxg1342xxx  (also known as  xxxg1342xxx 
or  xxxg1342xxx ), very low-density lipoprotein
receptor, and  xxxg177xxx  receptor 2.
common structural features of these receptors include: (1) clusters of class a
cysteine-rich ligand-binding repeats called
 xxxg1318xxx  class a (ldlra) domains,
(2)  xxxg681xxx -like domains,
(3) spacer regions that include tyr-trpthr-asp repeats, (4) a single transmembrane domain, and (5) a carboxyl-terminal
cytoplasmic tail with 1–3 copies of the
asn-pro-xxx-tyr motif, which serve as
potential endocytosis signals. the gene
coding for lrp covers about 92 kb and
includes 89 exons. the 15-kb lrp cdna
encodes a protein that consists of 4525
amino acids. lrp is characterized by the
presence of 31 ldlra repeats, which are
arranged in four distinct clusters (denoted clusters i, ii, iii, and iv) with 2, 8,
10, and 11 ldlra domains, respectively.
clusters ii and iv have been shown to
constitute the ligand-binding domains
(willnow et al. 1994, neels et al. 1999).
lrp is synthesized as a single polypep-

9

tide chain and is cleaved in the transgolgi network by the endopeptidase furin. furin-mediated proteolysis results
in a 515-kda fragment that contains the
ligand-binding domains and an 85-kda
fragment comprising the transmembrane
and cytoplasmic domains. the subunits
remain associated in a noncovalent fashion as they are routed to the cell surface.
routing of lrp to the cellular surface is
mediated by its chaperone protein, the
39-kda receptor-associated protein (rap).
rap is essential for optimal folding of
lrp, and blocks premature, intracellular binding of lrp to its ligands (bu
and schwartz 1998). rap has proved
to serve as a valuable tool in studies directed to interactions between lrp
and its ligands.
lrp is abundantly present in various
tissues such as liver, placenta, lung, and
brain, and is expressed in an array of
cell types, including parenchymal cells,
kupffer cells, neurons, astrocytes, smooth
muscle cells, monocytes, adipocytes, and
fibroblasts. commonly used cell lines like
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells also
express lrp (fitzgerald et al. 1995). lrp
is involved in the transport of ligands
from the cell surface to the endosomal
degradation pathway, a process which
requires the presence of calcium ions
(moestrup et al. 1990). furthermore, lrp
has recently been proposed to contribute to the transcytosis of lactoferrin
through the blood-brain barrier (fillebeen et al. 1999), and appears to be
important in various cellular signaling
processes (willnow et al. 1999). the
multifunctional nature of lrp is underscored by the observation that targeted
disruption of the gene coding for lrp in
the mouse arrested the development of
 xxxg1342xxx /2 embryos around the implantation stage (day 13 of development) (herz
et al. 1992). at present, a remarkable
spectrum of structurally unrelated ligands
has been identified. these include apolipoproteins, lipases, proteases, protease/
inhibitor complexes, kunitz-type inhibitors, matrix proteins, and several others
(gliemann 1998, neels et al. 1998,
willnow et al. 1999). this broad range
of ligands and properties suggests a role
for the receptor in diverse physiological
and patho-physiological processes ranging from lipoprotein metabolism, fibrinolysis, cell growth and migration to
atherosclerosis, tumor metastasis, and
alzheimer’s disease. in addition, lrp

for selected time intervals at 378c, and the amount of degraded material was determined.

might play a role in hemostasis, as discussed below.
• interaction between factor
viii and lrp
the mechanism by which factor viii is
removed from the circulation is poorly
understood. the possibility that lrp may
serve as a clearance receptor for factor
viii was recently reported by two different research groups (lenting et al. 1999a,
saenko et al. 1999). by using purified
proteins, we found that the interaction
between factor viii and lrp is reversible
and both dose- and calcium-dependent.
in addition, the interaction is efficiently
inhibited in the presence of the lrpantagonist rap. the kinetic parameters,
describing complex assembly between
factor viii and lrp, indicate that factor viii binds to lrp with moderate affinity (affinity constant z60 nm). this
value is close to that reported by saenko
and coworkers (affinity constant z116
nm), and in the same range as described
for most of the other ligands for lrp,
like  xxxg1329xxx  (52 nm) (kounnas et
al. 1995a), b- xxxg178xxx 
(80 nm) (kounnas et al. 1995b), twochain urokinase (60 nm) (kounnas et al.
1993) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (35 nm) (horn et al. 1995). it is important to note, however, that the physiological concentration of factor viii
(approximately 0.5 nm) is 100-fold below
the affinity constant of the interaction be-

tween factor viii and lrp. it seems conceivable therefore that in vivo complex
formation between factor viii and lrp
is fully driven by local concentrations of
the receptor. alternatively, a mechanism
may exist that concentrates factor viii
at cellular surfaces enriched in lrp.
the interaction between lrp and
factor viii was also tested with cho
cells, which constitutively express lrp.
cho cells efficiently degrade 125i-labeled
factor viii, a process which is reduced
approximately 70% in the presence of
rap. a similar inhibition was found when
an anti-lrp polyclonal antibody preparation was used (lenting et al. 1999a).
these findings indicate that lrp contributes to the cellular uptake of factor
viii. this is further supported by experiments using cell lines which lack lrp.
these lrp-deficient cell lines, both mouse
embryonic fibroblasts and cho cells, degrade factor viii 2–3-fold less efficiently
than their lrp-expressing counterparts
(figure 2) (saenko et al. 1999). in summary, these data are compatible with a
mechanism in which lrp contributes to
the binding and transport of factor viii
to the intracellular degradation pathway.
• regions involved in lrp/factor
viii complex assembly:
factor viii light chain
following the identification of factor
viii as an lrp ligand, research was directed to the identification of those retcm vol. 10, no. 1, 2000

gions which contribute to assembly of
the lrp/factor viii complex. by using
ligand blotting, we found that the isolated light chain of factor viii is able to
bind to lrp. further evidence that factor viii light chain binds to lrp was
obtained by surface plasmon resonance
analysis. this analysis revealed that isolated factor viii light chain and the intact
factor viii heterodimer have a similar
affinity for lrp. in addition, 125i-labeled
factor viii heterodimer and factor
viii light chain are degraded at a similar rate by lrp-expressing cho-cells
(figure 2). these findings are in favor
of the view that the factor viii light
chain contributes significantly to the
interaction with lrp.
further support for the view that the
major binding site for lrp is located on
the factor viii light chain is provided
by the properties of the anti-factor viii
monoclonal antibody esh4. this antibody dose-dependently interferes with
the binding of factor viii light chain to
lrp (lenting et al. 1999a). antibody
esh4 has previously been identified to
bind to the c2 domain region of factor
viii light chain, which would be compatible with a lrp-interactive site within
this part of the light chain. indeed, a recombinant fragment encompassing the
factor viii c2 domain displayed dosedependent binding to lrp, the association of which was inhibited in the presence of esh4.
with regard to lrp, the location of
the factor viii light chain interaction
sites was elucidated by using recombinant lrp fragments (neels et al. 1999).
these fragments contain the lrp ldlra
domains and are referred to as lrpclusters i to iv. each of the lrp-clusters
was tested for binding to factor viii
light chain. lrp-clusters ii and iv display efficient association to factor viii
light chain, whereas no binding was observed when lrp-clusters i and iii were
employed. from more extended analysis
using overlapping fragments of lrpcluster ii, we demonstrated that the factor viii light chain-interaction site comprises ldlra domains 3 to 7 (neels et
al. 1999).
in conclusion, these findings are consistent with a model in which the carboxyterminal c2 domain of factor viii
light chain comprises a site that may
be recognized by two distinct regions
within lrp.
tcm vol. 10, no. 1, 2000

• regions involved in lrp/factor
viii complex assembly:
factor viii heavy chain
in initial studies, in which binding of
factor viii heavy chain to immobilized
lrp was assessed, no association could
be observed (lenting et al. 1999a). however, more recent studies in which a soluble ligand-binding fragment of lrp,
lrp-cluster ii, was incubated with immobilized factor viii heavy chain, demonstrated that factor viii heavy chain
has the ability to bind this recombinant
lrp fragment (unpublished observation).
this indicates that factor viii heavy
chain may also comprise a binding site for
lrp. the notion that factor viii heavy
chain may interact with lrp agrees with
observations made by saenko et al.
(1999), who reported that binding of purified intact factor viii to immobilized
lrp is inhibited in the presence of factor viii heavy chain or a fragment
thereof, factor viii a2 domain. furthermore, 125i-labeled a2 domain is degraded
approximately 5-fold less efficiently by
lrp-deficient mouse fibroblasts than
by lrp-expressing mouse fibroblasts.
the exact location of the lrp binding
site within the a2 domain was revealed
with the use of synthetic peptides. one
of these peptides, encompassing the a2
domain residues 484–508, interferes with
the binding of the a2 domain or factor
viii to lrp, strongly suggesting that this
particular factor viii region is involved
in lrp binding (saenko et al. 1999).
collectively, these data indicate that
multiple sites within factor viii contribute to the interaction with lrp: one
region encompasses the factor viii a2
domain residues 484–508, while a second region involves the carboxyterminal
c2 domain of factor viii light chain
(figure 1). both these regions are major
targets for inhibitory antibodies, which
develop in approximately 20% of the  xxxg751xxx  patients who are treated by
replacement therapy with purified factor
viii concentrates (lollar 1999). whether
or not the development of such inhibitors involves a lrp-dependent mechanism remains speculative, and needs further studies. another aspect of both the
a2 and c2 domain regions is that they are
known to serve an important role in factor viii function. the factor viii c2 domain comprises binding sites for vwf
and negatively charged phospholipids
(foster et al. 1990, saenko et al. 1994),

whereas the factor viii a2 domain region 484–508 has recently been shown
to encompass a factor ixa-interactive
site (fay and scandella 1999) (figure 1).
therefore, it seems likely that binding to
lrp is incompatible with factor viii
cofactor function.
• lrp/factor viii complex
assembly: effect of von
willebrand factor
in plasma, factor viii is tightly associated with vwf, its physiological carrier
protein (sadler 1998). the importance
of complex formation between factor
viii and vwf is exemplified by patients
having severe von willebrand disease
(type 3), who are lacking detectable vwf
protein. apart from exhibiting a defect
in primary hemostasis due to the absence of vwf, these patients also have a
secondary deficiency of factor viii. in
addition, the half-life of intravenously
administered factor viii in these patients
is severely reduced (sadler 1998). a similar phenotype is observed in patients
having mutations in factor viii (tyrosine
1680) (kemball-cook and tuddenham
1997) or vwf (von willebrand disease
normandy, i.e., type 2n) (nishino et al.
1989), which affect factor viii/vwf complex assembly. despite normal levels of
circulating vwf, factor viii levels in these
patients are severely reduced. apparently,
association of factor viii with vwf is required to maintain appropriate levels of
factor viii in the circulation, suggesting
that vwf prevents factor viii from premature clearance. this effect of vwf is
also observed in in vitro experiments
using cho cell lines that express recombinant factor viii (kaufman et al. 1988,
wise et al. 1991). levels of factor viii
that accumulate in medium are markedly increased in the presence of vwf,
which may indicate that vwf prevents
cellular internalization of factor viii.
in our studies, the effect of vwf on
the association of factor viii to lrp
was investigated. it appeared that vwf
interfered efficiently with factor viii/lrp
complex assembly in a dose-dependent
manner. binding of factor viii to lrp
was inhibited by more than 90% in the
presence of a 10-fold molar excess of vwf
over factor viii (lenting et al. 1999a).
furthermore, cellular degradation of
factor viii was fully suppressed in the
presence of vwf. it seems conceivable,

11

therefore, that vwf prevents factor viii
binding to lrp. however, our results are
dissimilar to those reported by saenko
et al. (1999). in their studies, vwf was
unable to interfere with binding of 125ilabeled factor viii to immobilized lrp,
while cellular degradation of factor viii
in the presence of vwf was reduced by
approximately 50%. the reason for this
discrepancy between these studies is unclear, but may be related to the different
experimental approaches and cell lines
that were used.
the involvement of lrp in the clearance of factor viii in vivo has recently
been studied by employing mice genetically deficient in vwf, which have a secondary deficiency of factor viii (20–30%
of normal) (schwarz et al. 2000). as expected, endogenous factor viii levels
were increased 2–3-fold upon the administration of vwf. intriguingly, a similar increase of endogenous factor viii
levels was observed upon the infusion of
the lrp-antagonist rap. furthermore,
pre-administration of rap resulted in a
delayed clearance of factor viii after its
infusion. apparently the presence of
rap affects both endogenous and exogenous factor viii levels in the absence of
vwf. these data are consistent with a
mechanism in which inhibition of a rapsensitive pathway, most likely involving
lrp, prevents the accelerated clearance
of factor viii in the absence of vwf.
both the in vitro and in vivo studies may
explain the beneficial effect of vwf on
the in vivo survival of circulating factor viii, in that vwf seems to interfere
with lrp-mediated internalization of
factor viii.
• activated factors viii and
ix as ligands for lrp
the observation that cellular degradation
of factor viii is fully suppressed in the
presence of vwf restricts the role of
lrp to those conditions in which factor
viii is not associated to vwf. first, this
may be in pathological states such as severe von willebrand disease. second,
factor viii dissociates from vwf upon
thrombin-mediated activation (reviewed
by lenting et al. 1998). within activated
factor viii ( xxxg751xxx ), the aminoterminal a3 segment of factor viii light
chain has been removed. this results in
loss of high-affinity binding to vwf (lollar et al. 1988), whereas the affinity for

12

lrp remains unchanged (lenting et al.
1999a). dissociation of the factor viii/
vwf complex allows  xxxg751xxx  to assemble into a membrane-bound active
complex with its enzyme factor ixa.
the interaction between factor ixa and
 xxxg751xxx  is mediated by multiple interactive sites, located in both the heavy
and light chain of  xxxg751xxx  (figure
1; mertens et al. 1999).
a striking observation in this respect
relates to our studies concerning the interaction between lrp and factor ixa
(lenting et al. 1999b). factor ixa efficiently binds to lrp, in contrast to its
inactive precursor, the  xxxg752xxx  zymogen, in a reversible and dose- and
calcium-dependent manner. in addition,
the amount of factor ixa degraded by
lrp-deficient cells is approximately 35%
lower than the lrp-expressing cells,
showing that lrp contributes to the
binding and transport of factor ixa to
the intracellular degradation pathway.
thus, lrp is not only able to bind and
internalize the cofactor  xxxg751xxx , but
also its enzyme, factor ixa. whether
lrp is able to bind both  xxxg751xxx 
and factor ixa simultaneously or to
promote dissociation of the complex remains to be investigated. it is noteworthy
that factor viii light chain has similar
affinity for both lrp-cluster ii and iv
(kd z120 and 90 nm, respectively),
whereas factor ixa displays 4-fold higher
affinity for lrp-cluster iv as compared
to cluster ii (kd z230 and 50 nm, respectively). this may allow a mechanism in
which lrp interacts with both factor viii
light chain and factor ixa simultaneously
with its cluster ii and iv, respectively.
the  xxxg751xxx /factor ixa complex
is responsible for the conversion of  xxxg741xxx  to its activated form,  xxxg741xxx  (reviewed by lenting et al. 1998). it would
be of interest to investigate to what extent  xxxg741xxx  generation by the factor
viiia/factor ixa complex is affected by
lrp. from previous studies it is known
that lrp is abundantly expressed at the
surface of cells which are present at sites
of vascular injury, like monocytes, fibroblast and smooth muscle cells (moestrup
et al. 1992). the amount of  xxxg741xxx 
generated by the  xxxg751xxx /factor
ixa complex at the surface of endothelial
cells is markedly higher than the amount
generated at the surface of monocytes or
fibroblasts (brinkman et al. 1994). this
agrees with the fact that human umbili-

cal vein endothelial cells lack lrp (grobmyer et al. 1993), whereas monocytes
and fibroblasts constitutively express this
receptor at their surface (moestrup et al.
1992). therefore, it seems conceivable
that lrp interferes with the activity of
the  xxxg751xxx /factor ixa complex,
resulting in down-regulation of factor
xa generation.
• initiating and propagating steps
of the coagulation process:
modulation by lrp?
upon vascular injury, various hemostatic
pathways react in a concerted action in
order to arrest bleeding. one of these
pathways, the coagulation cascade, is
a sequence of amplifying (often cellsurface-dependent) reactions in which
zymogens are converted into their enzymatic conformations. this cascade
ultimately results in the generation of
thrombin, which is responsible for the
formation of an insoluble fibrin-network
which stabilizes the primary hemostatic
plug. traditionally, two distinct coagulation pathways have been distinguished:
the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway (figure 3). however, extensive research in
the area of coagulation revealed the presence of several biochemical connections
between both pathways (mann 1999).
the extrinsic pathway evidently represents an initial phase mediated by the
 xxxg748xxx /factor viia complex, while
the intrinsic pathway represents an amplifying loop involving the  xxxg751xxx /
factor ixa complex.
the coagulation cascade is tightly regulated by a complex system of feedback
reactions and specific inhibitors, including those of the  xxxg745xxx  inhibitor
(serpin) and kunitz-type inhibitor family. these inhibitors form irreversible
complexes with their target-enzymes,
and such complexes (e.g., thrombin/
antithrombin and  xxxg741xxx /a2-macroglobulin complexes) may subsequently be
removed from the circulation by a mechanism that involves lrp (strickland and
kounnas 1997, narita et al. 1998), illustrating that lrp and the coagulation system are linked in a functional manner.
however, removal of inactive complexes
is unlikely to provide a significant contribution to the regulation of coagulation. in contrast, the notion that lrp is
able to remove the active proteins  xxxg751xxx  and factor ixa and not the intcm vol. 10, no. 1, 2000

figure 3. schematic representation of the coagulation cascade. depicted is a simplified
scheme of the activation reactions within the coagulation cascade. vascular damage allows
formation of the  xxxg748xxx /factor viia complex at cellular surfaces. this complex initiates
the activation of small amounts of  xxxg752xxx  and  xxxg741xxx , as the complex is rapidly inhibited
by  xxxg2266xxx  in a reversible manner.  xxxg741xxx  subsequently generates small amounts of thrombin,
an enzyme essential for platelet activation and fibrin polymerization. feedback activation mediated by thrombin (dotted lines) results in activation of factors xi, viii and v, allowing formation of factor ixa/ xxxg751xxx  and  xxxg741xxx / xxxg749xxx  complexes. these complexes are
responsible for a further boost of thrombin formation (“propagation step”). within this propagation step,  xxxg751xxx  and factor ixa are identified as targets for lrp, and lrp may therefore contribute to down-regulation of this pathway. lrp is also involved in down-regulation of
the initiation step by removal of the trimeric  xxxg748xxx /factor viia/ xxxg2266xxx  complex from the
cellular surface.

active vwf-bound factor viii and the
zymogen  xxxg752xxx  underscores a possible regulatory role for lrp in blood coagulation (figure 3). this view becomes
even more intriguing if one considers an
elegant study on the interaction between
lrp and the  xxxg748xxx /factor viia
complex, recently reported by hamik et
al. (1999). this complex acts as a trigger
of the coagulation cascade when formed
at the surface of various cells, including
endothelial cells and monocytes. the activity of this complex is inhibited in a reversible manner by the kunitz-type inhibitor  xxxg748xxx  pathway inhibitor
( xxxg2266xxx ) (broze 1992), which has previously been established to be a ligand for
lrp (warshawsky et al. 1994). hamik et
al. (1999) showed that in the presence of
 xxxg2266xxx  the amount of  xxxg748xxx /factor
viia complex present at the surface of
monocytes was decreased. this downregulation, however, was efficiently abrogated when performed in the presence
tcm vol. 10, no. 1, 2000

of the lrp-antagonist rap. this indicates
that the trimeric  xxxg748xxx /factor
viia/ xxxg748xxx  pathway inhibitor complex is internalized via a lrp-mediated
pathway. indeed, recombinant  xxxg2266xxx  variants lacking the lrp-binding region were
unable to down-regulate  xxxg748xxx /
factor viia complexes at the monocyte
cell surface. more recently, it has been reported that a similar mechanism exists at
the surface of fibroblasts (iakhiaev et al.
1999). it is relevant that down-regulation at the surface of fibroblasts requires
the presence of the  xxxg745xxx   xxxg741xxx , whereas the down-regulation of
the surface of monocytes proceeds efficiently in the absence of  xxxg741xxx .
thus, subtle differences in mechanisms
may exist between various cell types.
• concluding remarks
compelling evidence has emerged that
shows that lrp is able to bind and in-

ternalize a number of components that
are critical for appropriate coagulation.
as these components are related to both
initiating ( xxxg748xxx /factor viia/
 xxxg748xxx  pathway inhibitor complex)
and propagating ( xxxg751xxx /factor ixa
complex) stages of the coagulation process, it is tempting to speculate that lrp
serves a so far unrecognized role in
modulation of the coagulation cascade.
in addition, both the in vitro and in vivo
studies (lenting et al. 1999a, saenko et
al. 1999, schwarz et al. 2000) may provide an explanation for the long-standing
observation that the circulatory lifetime
of factor viii in patients with severe von
willebrand disease is decreased. thus,
lrp may contribute to the circulating
levels of proteins involved in coagulation. finally, the observation that lrp is
involved in cellular signalling indicates
that the coagulation-related proteins
have the potential to use lrp to induce
cellular signalling processes. in our view,
this possibility is challenging and deserves
further study.
