cardiac effects of  xxxg92xxx  stimulation with intracoronary  xxxd3017xxx  in the absence and presence of regional myocardial ischemia in dogs.  to evaluate consequences of cardiac  xxxg92xxx  stimulation on coronary hemodynamics and regional myocardial function assessed by sonomicrometry in the normal and regionally ischemic heart, the effects of administration of  xxxd3017xxx , a selective  xxxg92xxx  agonist, into the left circumflex coronary artery (lcx) were examined in the absence and presence of a stenosis of the lcx in anesthetized open-chest dogs. the stenosis of the lcx was made sufficient to decrease percent segment shortening in the lcx-perfused region to around 2 to 3%. when coronary stenosis was absent, intracoronary infusion of  xxxd3017xxx  (6.7 ng/min for 15 min) produced significant increases in lcx flow and myocardial segment shortening in the infused region without changes in global hemodynamics. during coronary stenosis, on the contrary, intracoronary  xxxd3017xxx  at the same dose significantly deteriorated regional myocardial dysfunction without changing lcx flow, global hemodynamics and cardiac lactate metabolism. these changes induced by  xxxd3017xxx  were not observed in the dogs treated with a selective beta-2 antagonist,  xxxd2033xxx -(+/-)-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminob utan-2-ol. these results suggest the presence of functional beta-2 adrenoceptors in the canine heart both with and without myocardial ischemia.
