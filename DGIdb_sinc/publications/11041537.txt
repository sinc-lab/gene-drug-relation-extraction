1. this study was prompted by recent deaths that have occurred after recreational administration of the
substituted amphetamine
 xxxd2844xxx 
(pma).
because relatively little is known
regarding its mechanism(s) of action, its effects on physiological, behavioural and neurochemical
parameters were compared with the well known effects of  xxxd2611xxx 
(mdma).
2. equivalent doses of pma (5-20 mg/kg) produced greater hypothermia than mdma at an ambient
temperature of 20 “c. at 30 “c, pma continued to evoke hypothermia except the highest dose where
hyperthermia ensued. mdma altered body temperature only at the highest dose where hyperthermia
also resulted.
3. at both 20 and 30 “c, mdma stimulated locomotor activity whereas pma had modest effects and
then, only at high doses.
4. in vivo chronoamperometry
was used to measure the effect of mdma and pma on release, and
inhibition of uptake, of serotonin (5-ht) and dopamine (da) in the dorsal striatum of anaesthetised
rats. as expected, mdma evoked release of da and inhibited uptake of both da and 5-ht. by
contrast, pma was a relatively weak releasing agent and did not inhibit da uptake. however, pma
potently inhibited uptake of 5-ht.
5, taken together these data suggest that the acute adverse effects of pma are more likely to be
associated with alterations in serotonergic rather than dopaminergic neurotransmission.

the identity of the released neurotransmitter

was tentatively identified using the reduction-oxidation

ratios obtained in vitro (daws et al., 1997; gratton et al., 1989; hoffman and gerhardt, 1999 and present
study). the released transmitter

evoked by mdma was characteristic

of da with the resultant red:ox

ratio being 0.62 + 0.12 (8 and 65 pmol combined, n=lo). the red:ox ratio was the same regardless of
whether 8 or 65 pmol of drug was delivered.
