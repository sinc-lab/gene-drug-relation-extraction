utility of  xxxd3395xxx  in fluctuating parkinson's disease.  fluctuating parkinson's disease (pd) represents a clinical management challenge. the primary utility of levodopa in patients with pd is moderated by the "wearing off" phenomena seen with long-term use. comt inhibitors slow down the rapid metabolism of levodopa, resulting in a more-sustained response to dopaminergic therapy.  xxxd3395xxx  is a selective, reversible  xxxg487xxx  (comt) inhibitor, shown to have both peripheral and central effects. in clinical trials,  xxxd3395xxx  has been shown to reduce "off" time, increase "on" time, improve patient and clinician assessments of disease severity, and improve patient quality of life. in a switch study,  xxxd3395xxx  was associated with greater duration of "on" time than remaining on  xxxd2000xxx . adverse effects of  xxxd3395xxx  are related to the class, with the exception of rare cases of hepatotoxicity.  xxxd3395xxx  has been recently reintroduced on the european market and recent guidance from the us food and drug administration has reduced the hepatic monitoring requirements for patients initiating  xxxd3395xxx  therapy. with proper monitoring,  xxxd3395xxx  is an effective, well-tolerated drug useful in the management of patients with fluctuating pd.
