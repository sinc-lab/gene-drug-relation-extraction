abstract
rationale aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic drug
with high in vitro affinity for 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a and
dopamine (da) d2 receptors. however, its in vivo actions
in the brain are still poorly characterized.
objective the aim was to study the in vivo actions of
aripiprazole in the rat and mouse brain.
methods brain microdialysis and single-unit extracellular
recordings were performed.
results the systemic administration of aripiprazole reduced 5-ht output in the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc)
and dorsal raphe nucleus of the rat. aripiprazole also
reduced extracellular 5-ht in the mpfc of wild-type (wt)
but not of 5-ht1a (−/−) knockout (ko) mice. aripiprazole
reversed the elevation in extracellular 5-ht output produced by the local application of the 5-ht2a/2c receptor
agonist doi in mpfc. aripiprazole also increased the da
output in mpfc of wt but not of 5-ht1a ko mice, as
observed for atypical antipsychotic drugs, in contrast to
haloperidol. contrary to haloperidol, which increases the
firing rate of da neurons in the ventral tegmental area
(vta), aripiprazole induced a very moderate reduction in

dopaminergic activity. haloperidol fully reversed the
inhibition in dopaminergic firing rate induced by apomorphine, whereas aripiprazole evoked a partial reversal that
was significantly different from that evoked by haloperidol
and from the spontaneous reversal of dopaminergic activity
in rats treated with apomorphine.
conclusions these results indicate that aripiprazole modulates the in vivo 5-ht and da release in mpfc through the
activation of 5-ht1a receptors. moreover, aripiprazole
behaves as a partial agonist at da d2 autoreceptors in
vivo, an action which clearly distinguishes it from
haloperidol.

generation (neuroleptic) antipsychotic drugs alleviate psychotic symptoms and produce severe motor side effects
through the same pharmacological mechanism, blockade of
dopamine (da) d2 receptors (kapur et al. 2000). secondgeneration (atypical) antipsychotic drugs have an improved
tolerability and milder motor side effects than classical
neuroleptics but produce weight gain and metabolic
disturbances (newcomer 2005). moreover, cognitive deficits, which are central to the illness (elvevag and goldberg
2000), are poorly treated, and there is an urgent need for
improved treatments.
aripiprazole (ari) is a novel atypical antipsychotic drug
that differs from other classical and atypical antipsychotics,
improving both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis without producing extrapyramidal side effects or
increases in serum prolactin (tamminga 2002; deleon et
al. 2004). ari shows high affinity for a large number of
monoaminergic receptors, including da d2, 5-ht1a and 5ht2a receptors (shapiro et al. 2003; green 2004).
concerning the dopaminergic system, ari attenuates
apomorphine (apo)-induced stereotypy in mice and
reduces dopa synthesis in the forebrain of reserpine-treated
mice, suggesting that, unlike classical and other atypical
drugs, it exhibits agonistic activity at presynaptic da
autoreceptors and antagonistic activity at postsynaptic da
d2 receptors (kikuchi et al. 1995; momiyama et al. 1996).
in vitro, ari activates  xxxg656xxx -mediated inhibition of
 xxxd1773xxx  accumulation stimulated
by  xxxd1742xxx  in chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with
the human d2l receptor gene (burris et al. 2002; tadori et
al. 2005). on the other hand, ari blocked the actions of
da on d1 and d2 receptors in nucleus accumbens (amano
et al. 1995). interestingly, ari occupies more than 80% of
striatal da d2 receptors at therapeutic doses but does not
produce extrapyramidal side effects (yokoi et al. 2002;
grunder et al. 2003), thus deviating from the classical
relationship between da  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and
occurrence of motor side effects. overall, these data suggest
that ari may act as a partial da d2 agonist in vivo.
in parallel to its actions at da d2 receptors, ari has
affinity for several 5-ht receptors (lawler et al. 1999;
shapiro et al. 2003). hence, it behaves as a partial agonist
at 5-ht1a receptors and as an antagonist at 5-ht2a
receptors as assessed in vitro (jordan et al. 2002; tamminga
2002; shapiro et al. 2003; green 2004). these activities
may also participate in the therapeutic action of ari. in
addition to the affinity for 5-ht2a receptors displayed by
atypical antipsychotics (meltzer 1999), ari may activate  xxxg1108xxx  receptors, which are currently a focus of interest in
antipsychotic drug development (millan 2000). hence,
atypical (but not classical) antipsychotics increase da
release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc; rollema et
al. 1997, 2000; ichikawa et al. 2001; assié et al. 2005), an

psychopharmacology (2007) 191:745–758

effect that depends on the activation of 5-ht1a receptors
localized in mpfc (díaz-mataix et al. 2005). given the
crucial role of prefrontal da in cognitive function
(williams and goldman-rakic 1995), the increase in mpfc
da release may underlie the slightly superior effects of
clozapine and other atypical antipsychotic drugs on the
spectrum of cognitive and negative/affective symptoms
(harvey and keefe 2001) by normalizing a putative
impaired dopaminergic transmission in mpfc (weinberger
et al. 1994; akil et al. 1999).
in the present study, we examined the in vivo actions of
ari on the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in
rodent brain, with a special emphasis on the possible
actions on 5-ht1a receptors and on its putative partial
agonist activity on da d2 receptors.

materials and methods
animals and treatments
male albino wistar rats weighing 250–320 g and c57bl/6
mice, 10–12 week old at the time of the experiments, were
used (iffa credo, lyon, france).  xxxg1108xxx  knockout
ko(−/−) mice (referred onwards as ko) were generated at
princeton university (parks et al. 1998) and had the same
genetic background as their wild-type (wt) counterparts
(c57bl/6). from this initial source, a stable colony was
grown in the animal facility of the university of barcelona
school of medicine. animals were kept in a controlled
environment (12-h light–dark cycle and 22±2°c room
temperature) with food and water provided ad libitum.
animal care followed the european union regulations (o.j.
of e.c. l358/1 18/12/1986) and was approved by the
institutional animal care and use committee.
stereotaxic coordinates (in mm) were taken from bregma
and dura mater according to the atlas of paxinos and watson
(1998) for rat and franklin and paxinos (1997) for mouse.
8-oh-dpat, apo, doi (1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane]) and way-100635 were from
rbi (natick, ma). bayx3702 was from bayer, and
ari was from bristol myers squibb. concentrated solutions were prepared in artificial csf (acsf) or saline and
stored at −80°c (ph adjusted to 6.5–7.4 with nahco3
when necessary), and working solutions were prepared
daily by dilution in acsf. apo was freshly prepared daily
in saline. drugs were dissolved in vehicle at the appropriate
concentrations and injected i.p. or i.v. (femoral vein) as
indicated in “results”. in microdialysis experiments involving local drug administration, the stated drug concentrations were applied by reverse dialysis (uncorrected for
drug recovery). for systemic administrations, ari was
dissolved in a vehicle consisting of hydroxypropyl-beta-

psychopharmacology (2007) 191:745–758

cyclodextrin (1.4 g dissolved in 15 ml distilled water).
haloperidol (hal) was used as commercial injectable
solution (laboratorios esteve, barcelona, spain) and was
injected i.v. in electrophysiological experiments. control
rats received the vehicle (systemic drug administration) or
were perfused with acsf for the whole period (local
microdialysis experiments). the bars in the figures show
the period of drug application (corrected for the void
volume of the system).
after experimental procedures were completed, animals
were killed by an overdose of anesthetic, and a careful
histological verification of the correct placement of the
implants was carried out.

single-unit recordings
we examined the responses of ventral tegmental area
(vta) da neurons to the systemic administration of
apo. the suppressant action of apo was then counteracted with hal and ari. rats were anesthetized (chloral
hydrate 400 mg/kg i.p.) and positioned in a david kopf
stereotaxic frame. thereafter, chloral hydrate was continuously administered i.p. at a dose of 50–70 mg/kg·h using a
perfusion pump (fa et al. 2003). body temperature was
maintained at 37°c with a heating pad. to minimize
pulsation, the atlanto-occipital membrane was punctured
to release some csf. da neurons were recorded extracellularly with glass micropipettes pulled from 2.0-mm
capillary glass (wpi, sarasota, fl) on a narishige pe-2
pipette puller (narishige sci. inst., tokyo, japan). microelectrodes were filled with 2 m nacl. typically, in vitro
impedance was 4–10 momega. single-unit extracellular recordings were amplified with a neurodata ir283 (cygnus
technology, delaware water gap, pa), postamplified and
filtered with a cibertec amplifier (madrid, spain) and
computed on-line using a dat 1401 plus interface system
spike2 software (cambridge electronic design, cambridge, uk).
descents in vta were carried out at ap −5.0 to −5.6, l
−0.5 to −1 and dv −7.5 to −9.0. the identification of da
neurons and burst firing analysis was carried out according
to the criteria of grace and bunney (1984) as previously
used (celada et al. 1999; díaz-mataix et al. 2005). briefly,
neurons were considered dopaminergic if they possessed the
following characteristics: (1) action potential duration greater
than 2.5 ms, (2) typical bi- or triphasic waveform, often with
a notch in the initial rising phase, (3) slow firing rate
(recorded neurons fired at 1–6 spikes/s in control rats), and
(4) frequent presence of bursts. the structure of bursts was
defined as starting with a first interspike interval of <80 ms
and ending with an interspike interval of 160 ms or greater
(grace and bunney 1984).

microdialysis
microdialysis procedures in rats and mice were conducted
essentially as recently described in bortolozzi et al. (2003),
bortolozzi and artigas (2003) and amargós-boch et al.
(2004). rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(60 mg/kg i.p.) and implanted with 4-mm concentric
dialysis probes (cuprophan) in mpfc at ap +3.2, l −0.8
and dv −6.0. groups of rats were also implanted with
probes in the dorsal raphe nucleus (dr) at −7.4, l −3.1 and
dv −7.5 with a lateral angle of 30° (probe tip 1.5 mm).
microdialysis experiments were performed in freely moving rats >20 h after surgery. probes were perfused with
acsf pumped at 1.5 mul/min. after an initial 100-min
stabilization period, four baseline samples were collected
(20 min each) before local (reverse dialysis) or systemic
drug administration and then successive dialysate samples
were collected.
for mice, the manufacture of the probes was adapted
from that previously described for rats (bortolozzi et al.
2003). surgical and microdialysis procedures were identical
to those described for rats except for the dose of anesthesia
(sodium pentobarbital, 40 mg/kg, i.p.), the length of
dialysis membrane (2 mm) and the brain coordinates (in
mm) of the mpfc: ap +2.2, l −0.2 and dv −3.4.
the concentration of 5-ht and da in dialysate samples
was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with amperometric detection, using slight
modifications of previously described methods. updated
procedures can be found in bortolozzi et al. (2003) and
díaz-mataix et al. (2005). brain dialysates were collected
in microvials and were injected into the hplc. for da
analysis, microvials contained 5 mul of 10 mm perchloric
acid. the amperometric detection (hewlett packard 1049
detector) of 5-ht ad da was carried out, respectively, at
+0.6 and +0.75 v. detection limits were typically 1–1.5
fmol for 5-ht and 3 fmol for da.
data analysis
changes in the electrical activity of da neurons were
assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance
(anova) followed by post hoc t tests. paired t test was
also used when appropriate. firing rate and burst firing
were quantified by averaging the values each minute after
i.v. drug administration (omitting the first minute). microdialysis results are expressed as fmol/fraction (uncorrected
for recovery) and shown in figures as percentages of basal
values (individual means of four pre-drug fractions).
microdialysis data were analyzed using one- or two-way
repeated measures anova, with drug as independent
factor and time as repeated factor. the area under the curve
values of selected periods of drug treatment were also

results
effects of ari on spontaneous 5-ht release in rat and mice
brain
baseline dialysate 5-ht values in rat brain were 75±
16 fmol/fraction (dr, n = 8) and 37 ± 2 fmol/fraction
(mpfc, n=26). in mouse mpfc, 5-ht values were 29±
2 fmol/fraction (wt, n=17) and 29±3 fmol/fraction ( xxxg1108xxx  ko, n=18). the administration of ari (3, 10 and
30 mg/kg i.p.) reduced the 5-ht output in the mpfc and
the dorsal raphe (dr) of freely moving rats compared with
rats treated with the vehicle (hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin
solution). successive vehicle injections elicited moderate
(~20%) increases of extracellular 5-ht, likely due to the
injection-associated stress (adell et al. 1997), whereas ari
induced a significant reduction in 5-ht in dr (p<0.005
group effect, p<0.01 time effect and p<0.005 time×group
interaction) and mpfc (p<0.05 group effect and p<0.02
time effect; fig. 1). the maximal reduction in 5-ht release
was attained at 3 mg/kg, and subsequent injections of 10
and 30 mg/kg ari did not reduce dialysate 5-ht further.
to examine the involvement of 5-ht1a receptors in the 5ht-reducing effect of ari, we examined its effects on the 5ht release in mpfc of wt and 5-ht1a ko mice. the i.p.
administration of the vehicle did not alter dialysate 5-ht
except for a short time increase after the injection, which is
likely due to the handling and injection stress and that was
slightly greater in 5-ht1a ko mice as previously observed
(bortolozzi et al. 2004; fig. 2a). the i.p. administration of
3 mg/kg ari induced a moderate but significant reduction in
the 5-ht output, which was not different between wt and
ko mice (n=6 each; p<0.0001 significant effect of time but
not of group or time×group interaction; fig. 2b). the
subsequent injection of the selective  xxxg1108xxx  agonist
8-oh-dpat (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) markedly reduced the 5-ht
output in a subgroup of wt but not ko mice within this
experiment (p<0.03 group effect, p=0.06 time effect and
p<0.001 time×group interaction; n=3 each; fig. 2b).
in contrast, the administration of 30 mg/kg ari elicited
a more marked reduction in the 5-ht output in wt than in
5-ht1a ko mice (p<0.00001 time effect and p<0.0005
time×group interaction; n=6 each; fig. 2c). as also
observed previously, the subsequent i.p. administration of
0.5 mg/kg 8-oh-dpat reduced the 5-ht output further in
wt but not in  xxxg1108xxx  ko mice (p<0.0001 group
effect, p<0.0001 time effect and p<0.0001 time×group
interaction; n=6 each; fig. 2c). these results indicate that

30 but not 3 mg/kg ari reduced 5-ht output in mouse
mpfc by a 5-ht1a-dependent mechanism.
effects of ari on doi-stimulated 5-ht release in rat
and mice mpfc
previous reports indicate that the local application of both
classical (chlorpromazine, hal) and atypical (clozapine,
olanzapine) antipsychotic drugs reverse the increase in 5ht levels in mpfc evoked by the hallucinogen doi, a 5ht2a/2c receptor agonist (bortolozzi et al. 2003). we
therefore examined the ability of ari to reverse doistimulated 5-ht release in mpfc.
as previously observed in rat and mouse mpfc (martínruiz et al. 2001a; bortolozzi et al. 2003), the application of

psychopharmacology (2007) 191:745–758

749

100 mum doi by reverse dialysis doubled the local 5-ht
output (p<0.0001; fig. 3). the co-perfusion of 100 mum
ari did not counteract the effect of doi, whereas a higher
concentration (300 mum) significantly antagonized doi’s
effect on 5-ht output (p=0.057 group effect, p<0.00001
time effect and p<0.00001 time×group interaction; fig. 3).
comparison of the effect of hal and ari on the apoinduced suppression of da cell firing in rat vta
the systemic administration of ari (0.4–0.8 mg/kg i.v.) to
chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats (n=6) induced a moderate
reduction in the firing rate of vta dopaminergic neurons
from 3.2 ±0.7 spikes/s (baseline) to 2.7± 0.6 spikes/s
(0.4 mg/kg i.v.) and 2.7±0.7 spikes/s (0.8 mg/kg i.v.;
p<0.03, one-way repeated measures anova; p<0.05
between both doses of ari and baseline; non-significant
differences between 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg; post hoc tukey t
test). when considering the maximal effect in all neurons,
irrespective of the dose required, the firing rate was
reduced to 2.4±0.6 spikes/s (p<0.008, paired student’s t
test vs baseline). the percentage of spikes fired in burst
was also reduced by ari treatment, from 12.3±3.6%
(baseline) to 5.9±2.3% (0.4 mg/kg i.v.) and 5.1±3.1%
(0.8 mg/kg i.v.; p=0.057, one-way repeated measures
anova). the maximal effect was to 4.4±2.6% (p<0.035
vs baseline). figure 4 shows representative examples of
the effect of ari administration on two dopaminergic
neurons.
the moderate suppressing effect of ari on dopaminergic cell firing was consistent with a weak partial agonist
action. we then examined whether ari could reverse the

fig. 2 effect of the i.p. administration of vehicle (a), 3 mg/kg
aripiprazole (ari; b) and 30 mg/kg ari (c) on the 5-ht output in the
mpfc of wild type (wt) and  xxxg1108xxx  knockout (ko) mice
(n=6 each except the vehicle/wt group, n=5). the subsequent
administration of the selective 5-ht1a agonist 8-oh-dpat (0.5 mg/
kg i.p.) reduced the 5-ht output in wt but not in  xxxg1108xxx 
ko mice (n=3 for the groups treated with 3 mg/kg ari; n=6 for the
groups treated with 30 mg/kg ari). see text for statistical details

fig. 3 the application of the 5-ht2a/2c receptor agonist doi
(100 mum) by reverse dialysis enhanced the local 5-ht output in rat
mpfc (n = 6). the co-perfusion of 300 mum (n = 7) but not 100 mum
(n = 5) aripiprazole (ari) significantly reversed the 5-ht elevation
evoked by the application of doi. horizontal bars show the period
of drug application. see text for statistical analysis

fig. 4 integrated firing rate histograms showing the effects of i.v.
injections (arrows) of aripiprazole (ari; a, b) and haloperidol (hal;
c) on the firing activity of dopaminergic neurons in the vta
(ordinate: spikes/10 s; see bar time in abscissa). the upper traces in
these panels show representative burst trains corresponding to 2-min
recordings obtained in baseline conditions and after the administration
of 0.8 mg/kg i.v. ari or 0.2 mg/kg i.v. hal. the neuron in a had a
basal firing rate of 4.7 spikes/s and decreased to 4.1 and 3.8 spikes/s
after 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg i.v. ari. burst firing was 20% and was
reduced to 14% at both doses of ari. the neuron in b had a basal
firing rate of 2.27 spikes/s and decreased to 2.1 and 1.58 spikes/s after
0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg i.v. ari. burst firing was 13%, 11% and 5% in
baseline conditions and after the i.v. injection of 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg ari,
respectively. panel c shows a representative example of the
effect of i.v. hal on the firing rate of vta dopaminergic neurons.
contrary to ari, hal increased the firing rate of dopaminergic
neurons (from 2.1 spikes/s in baseline conditions to 4.9 and 6.2
spikes/s after 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg). burst firing was also increased from
23% to 65%. the neuron in c corresponds to data reported in díazmataix et al. (2005)

inhibition of cell firing induced by apo. rats were injected
with a single dose of apo (50 mug/kg i.v.), which induced a
marked suppression of the firing of da cells in the vta.
two minutes later, rats were administered with either saline
(n=9), hal (200 mug/kg i.v.; n=6) or ari (400 or 800 mug/kg
i.v; n=15 and 4, respectively.). as expected, hal administration completely reversed the suppressant effect of apo on
the overall firing rate (fig. 5). the i.v. administration of 400
or 800 mug/kg ari significantly reversed the suppressant
effect of apo on firing rate, but the reversal was less marked
than that produced by hal. the effects of 400 mug/kg ari
were examined in various groups of rats (up to a total of
n=15), which gave consistently the same partial recovery of
da cell firing.
figure 5 shows representative examples of the suppressant
effect of apo on da cell firing followed by spontaneous
reversal (fig. 5a) and by the effects of hal (fig. 5b) and ari
(fig. 5c). figure 6 shows the average effects in all units
examined. analysis of the data with two-way anova
showed a significant effect of the group (p<0.01), time
(p<0.00001) and time × group interaction (p<0.00001).
post hoc analysis revealed a significant difference between
hal and saline, ari and saline and hal and ari, with
no significant differences between the two ari doses.
likewise, burst firing was significantly different among
rats treated with apo alone and with apo + hal and
apo + ari (0.8±0.6%, 18.6±11.7% and 3.0±2.1%,
respectively; p<0.05 one-way anova; burst firing was
calculated from the last 3 min of recording; see fig. 5).
modulation of the mesocortical da release by ari
in mouse pfc
baseline da values in mpfc dialysates were 7±1 fmol/
fraction (wt, n=38) and 6±1 fmol/fraction (5-ht1a ko,
n=35). the i.p. administration of the vehicle did not alter

da release in the mpfc of wt and 5-ht1a ko mice. a
short-lasting increase was observed after the injection of the
vehicle, which, as that seen for 5-ht, can be attributed to
stress (fig. 7a). the administration of the selective 5-ht1a
agonist 8-oh-dpat (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) increased the da
output in wt but not in 5-ht1a mice (p<0.01 group effect,
p<0.0001 time effect and p<0.02 time×group interaction;
fig. 7b). in wt mice, the maximal increase in da output

and aripiprazole 400 mug/kg i.v. (ari, c). note the suppression of cell
firing induced by apomorphine in all units. as expected, hal
produced a full reversal of the inhibition followed by a rebound
increase that is likely due to the full blockade of self-inhibitory
mechanisms mediated by da d2 receptors at cell body level. in
contrast, ari induced a partial, but significant, reversal of the
apomorphine-induced inhibition

was to 181±24% of baseline. da values remained stable
for approximately four dialysate fractions (80 min). thereafter, da values ranged between 140 and 160% of baseline.
in contrast, 8-oh-dpat did not alter da output in 5-ht1a
ko mice.

similarly, another selective 5-ht1a agonist, bayx3702
(0.5 mg/kg i.p.) also increased da output in wt but not in
5-ht1a mice (p<0.0001 group effect, p<0.05 time effect
and p<0.00001 time×group interaction). the maximal
increase in the da output produced by bayx3702 was
comparable to that elicited by 8-oh-dpat (figs. 7 and 9).
the systemic administration of 3 mg/kg i.p. ari
produced a sustained increase the da output in the mpfc
of wt mice. however, the same treatment failed to
elevate cortical da in the mpfc of 5-ht1a ko mice,
except for a sharp increase just after the injection of ari,
which was also observed in wt mice (p<0.02, group effect
and p<0.0001 time effect; fig. 8b). at the end of the
experiment, mice received a subsequent challenge dose of
8-oh-dpat, which induced a further elevation of da
output in wt but not 5-ht1a mice (data not shown).
the administration of 30 mg/kg i.p. ari induced a da
increase in wt mice that was not statistically different to
that produced by the dose of 3 mg/kg (p<0.0001 time effect
but not significant group or time× group interactions;
figs. 8c and 9). as also observed for the 3-mg/kg dose,
30 mg/kg ari did not increase the da output in 5-ht1a
ko mice.

anesthetized rats. the present data support and extend
previous in vitro and in vivo observations on a  xxxd2082xxx 
of ari on both neurotransmitter systems, yet with
converging effects on the da system. in particular, we
show that ari has a partial agonist effect on the activity of
dopaminergic neurons that can account for previous
neurochemical and behavioural actions of this agent in
experimental animals. these data can also explain, at least
partly, the lack of extrapyramidal side effects of ari

electrophysiology
the data obtained indicates that ari has a consistent but
weak partial agonist effect on the activity of dopaminergic
neurons in the vta. this effect was observed on both
experimental models used (basal activity and apo-induced
suppression of cell firing).
ari modestly but consistently reduced the overall firing
rate of dopaminergic neurons as well as the percentage of
spikes fired in bursts. the ari-induced reduction in cell
firing can be attributed to its agonist action on da d2
receptors controlling dopaminergic cell firing (semba et al.
1995; shapiro et al. 2003). in contrast, ari induced a
partial but very consistent partial reversal of the suppressant
action of apo on da neuron activity, both in terms of the
overall firing rate and in burst firing.
the effect of ari appeared to reach a ceiling effect, as
the suppression of cell firing when administered alone was
similar at the two doses examined (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg i.v.).
these observations are consistent with a partial agonist
character of ari, which displays a low intrinsic efficacy in
vitro (burris et al. 2002; tadori et al. 2005). the effect of
ari totally differed from that of the classical  xxxg656xxx 
antagonist hal, which greatly enhanced the activity of
vta da neurons (chiodo and bunney 1983; gessa et al.
2000; díaz-mataix et al. 2005).
in agreement with previous studies (chiodo 1988), the
dose of apo chosen (50 mug/kg i.v.) fully suppressed the
firing rate of the majority of da neurons recorded.

753

consistent with its full antagonist properties at da d2
receptors, the subsequent administration of hal increased
the firing rate above baseline levels, most likely by
antagonizing an endogenous tone on da d2 autoreceptors.
however, the administration of ari significantly increased
the firing rate of da neurons above that produced by the
spontaneous reversal (control rats received the vehicle after
apo), but its effect was far from that achieved with hal.
two different doses of ari were used, with no significant
differences between them, indicating that 400 and 800 mug/
kg i.v. were maximal and equally effective, as also
observed for the inhibition of spontaneous cell firing.
the partial recovery of da cell firing produced by ari is
consistent with its partial da d2 agonist character
previously observed in vitro and in vivo (amano et al.
1995; green 2004; cosi et al. 2005).
hence, ari moderately inhibits the activity of vta da
neurons when given alone and partially antagonizes the
suppression of da cell firing induced by apo. indeed, few
previous reports have characterized the in vivo effects of
ari and other partial da agonists on the activity of vta
da neurons. to our knowledge, this is the first report
supporting the partial agonist effect of ari on vta da
cells in vivo. these observations have been confirmed in a
recent independent report (dahan et al. 2006), which
strengthens their value. thus, the present observations
provide a cellular basis for the effects of ari on damediated functions in experimental animals and humans
and contribute to further characterize its complex pharmacological profile.
similar to ari,  xxxd336xxx  also displays partial agonist
properties at da d2 receptors with an intrinsic efficacy
greater than that of ari in vitro (cosi et al. 2005) and in
vivo (dahan et al. 2006). contrary to these two agents,
preclamol [(-)3-ppp], which also displays partial agonist
activity at da d2 receptors, failed to demonstrate sustained
antipsychotic activity, perhaps due to the emergence of
tolerance (tamminga 2002). it is unclear whether the
different clinical activity of ari and preclamol is due to
their distinct degree of intrinsic efficacy at da d2 receptors
or to the existence of additional activities (e.g., 5-ht
receptors) in the case of ari. our comparison of the effect
of ari with the classical da d2 full antagonist hal does
not permit to clarify this issue. it is possible that affinity for
5-ht1a receptors may confer some additional degree of
clinical antipsychotic activity to da  xxxg656xxx  blockade,
as preclinical results suggest that this pharmacological
activity is key to elevate prefrontal da transmission
(rollema et al. 1997; ichikawa et al. 2001; díaz-mataix et
al. 2005; see below), and the addition of the 5-ht1a
receptor agonist tandospirone improved the cognitive status
of schizophrenic patients treated with standard neuroleptics
(sumiyoshi et al. 2000, 2001).

754

microdialysis experiments
in rats, ari reduced the 5-ht output in a terminal area
(mpfc) and in the cell body area (dr) at doses of 3–
30 mg/kg i.p. this decrease was moderate and was not
dose-dependent, as similar reductions were noted at 3, 10
and 30 mg/kg, in agreement with recent data in the
literature (assié et al. 2005). in mice, the dose of 3 mg/kg
produced also a moderate decline in the 5-ht output in the
mpfc. however, this effect does not depend on the
activation of 5-ht1a receptors, as it was common to wt
and 5-ht1a ko mice. the subsequent 8-oh-dpat
administration produced a further decrease in 5-ht output
in wt but not ko mice, as expected, which indicates that
the 5-ht decrease in wt mice at this dose was due to other
pharmacological activities of ari. it is unlikely that a
partial agonist action of ari on da d2 receptors may
contribute to the 5-ht decrease in mpfc and dr, as da
 xxxg656xxx  agonists increase 5-ht release in the dr and
the activity of 5-ht neurons (ferré et al. 1994; martín-ruiz
et al. 2001b).  xxxg1113xxx  blockade is also unlikely to
be involved, given that the 5-ht2a/2c receptor agonist doi
reduced the firing of 5-ht cells and the 5-ht output in the
mpfc of anesthetized rats after systemic administration
(martín-ruiz et al. 2001a). among the various pharmacological activities of ari, blockade of alpha1-adrenoceptors may
possibly participate in this effect, as the alpha1-adrenoceptor
antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  reduces 5-ht cell firing (vandermaelen
and aghajanian 1983) and 5-ht release in the dr and
terminal areas (rouquier et al. 1994; bortolozzi and artigas
2003). moreover, the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and
olanzapine reduce 5-ht cell firing in the dr through alpha1adrenocepor blockade (sprouse et al. 1999).
at 30 mg/kg, ari reduced 5-ht significantly more in
wt than in ko mice, which suggests that this higher dose
produced a direct activation of 5-ht1a receptors controlling 5-ht release. however, the degree of activation of  xxxg1108xxx  autoreceptors produced by this dose of ari appears
to be low, as the subsequent injection of 8-oh-dpat
(0.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced a more marked reduction in 5-ht
release. overall, these data suggest a partial agonist action
at 5-ht1a receptors in vivo, also consistent with previous
in vitro evidence (see shapiro et al. 2003 for review; see
also below for extended discussion on this point).
as previously observed for other classical and atypical
antipsychotic drugs (bortolozzi et al. 2003), the coperfusion of ari in mpfc reversed the increase in 5-ht
release produced by local application of the 5-ht2a/2c
agonist doi. this effect may involve various activities of
ari, such as  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism,  xxxg1108xxx 
agonism and/or alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonism, as antagonists
of both excitatory receptors (e.g., m100907 for 5-ht2a
receptors,  xxxd3000xxx  for alpha1-adrenoceptors) or agonists of

psychopharmacology (2007) 191:745–758

inhibitory receptors (e.g., 8-oh-dpat or bayx3702 for  xxxg1108xxx  receptors) reverse the increase in 5-ht release
produced by doi application in mpfc (martín-ruiz et al.
2001a; bortolozzi et al. 2003; amargós-bosch et al. 2004).
indeed, this functional antagonism is not due to a lack of
specificity of the agents used but to the fact that these
receptors are largely co-expressed in pyramidal neurons of
the mpfc (amargós-bosch et al. 2004; santana et al.,
unpublished observations) and play opposite roles on
pyramidal cell activity (araneda and andrade 1991;
amargós-bosch et al. 2004; puig et al. 2005). then,
blockade of 5-ht2a or alpha1-adrenergic receptors or agonist
actions at 5-ht1a receptors oppose to the action of doi,
resulting in changes in 5-ht release mediated by the
mpfc-raphe circuit (celada et al. 2001).
recent observations indicate that atypical antipsychotics
(clozapine, olanzapine and ziprasidone), but not hal,
increased the da output in the mpfc of wt but not  xxxg1108xxx  ko mice (díaz-mataix et al. 2005). in the present
study, we extend these observations to the case of ari. the
administration of 3 and 30 mg/kg i.p. ari enhanced da
release in the mpfc of wt but not ko mice (except for a
short-lasting increase occurring in both genotypes possibly
due to injection and handling stress). the effect size was
comparable to that produced by doses of the selective  xxxg1108xxx  agonists 8-oh-dpat and bayx3702 that are
maximal or nearly maximal to suppress 5-ht release in
mouse brain (0.5 mg/kg i.p.; typically ~tenfold higher than
in rats). previous studies have reported discordant results on
the effect of ari on da output in rodent mpfc. in the rat,
a bell-shaped dose–response (maximum 50% increase at
0.3 mg/kg, no change at 0.1, 1 and 3 mg/kg) was reported
by li et al. (2004), whereas no effect at all was found
between 2 and 40 mg/kg by jordan et al. (2004) and assié
et al. (2005). on the other hand, semba et al. (1995)
reported a moderate 20–25% reduction after 10 and
40 mg/kg ari. in mouse mpfc, a significant 80%
increase was found at 0.3 mg/kg (no change at 0.1, 1
and 3 mg/kg; zocchi et al. 2005). however, this effect
occurred 3 h after ari administration, whereas li et al.
(2004) reported a short-term increase soon (80–90 min)
after ari administration. the reasons for such discrepancies are unclear and can perhaps be attributed to the
insolubility of ari in water and the different ways used to
suspend or dissolve it in an aqueous vehicle before
systemic administration. in this paper, we used hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, similar to the cyclodextrin used to
dissolve ari in the intramuscular commercial preparation
(abilify®). this enabled us to completely dissolve ari at
the doses used in the present study. alternatively, given its
partial agonist action on various receptors, it may be that
the effect of ari on cortical da output depends on the
behavioural state of the animals used. likewise, as the

psychopharmacology (2007) 191:745–758

main metabolite of ari in rodents (dm 451) is a high
affinity antagonist at da d2 receptors (lawler et al.
1999), it may also be that the effects on da release can
depend on the dose and/or route of administration of ari.
 xxxg1108xxx  agonists and atypical antipsychotics
stimulate the da output in rat mpfc and the electrical
activity of vta da neurons (arborelius et al. 1993a,b;
rollema et al. 1997; lejeune and millan 1998; gobert et al.
1999; gessa et al. 2000; ichikawa et al. 2001; díazmataix et al. 2005). this effect appears to depend in part on
the activation of 5-ht1a receptors in mpfc, which may
then result in an increased activity of pyramidal neurons
projecting to the vta (díaz-mataix et al. 2005, 2006) and
the subsequent increase in the activity of mesocortical da
neurons and da release. interestingly, the latter effect is
shared by (a)  xxxg1108xxx  agonists; (b) atypical
antipsychotics such as ziprasidone (rollema et al. 2000)
or ari (li et al. 2004; assié et al. 2005; this study), with
moderate–high in vitro affinity for 5-ht1a receptors; and
(c) atypical antipsychotics with very low (clozapine) or
negligible in vitro affinity for 5-ht1a receptors, such as
clozapine, olanzapine or risperidone (rollema et al. 1997;
ichikawa et al. 2001; díaz-mataix et al. 2005). the increase
in da output produced by atypical antipsychotics, including those without direct in vitro affinity for 5-ht1a
receptors, is partly or totally antagonized by way-100635
(selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist; rollema et al. 1997,
2000; ichikawa et al. 2001; see, however, assié et al. 2005)
and by the genetic deletion of 5-ht1a receptors (díazmataix et al. 2005).
the cellular basis for this “indirect” activation of 5-ht1a
receptors by some atypical antipsychotics is presently
unknown. we recently suggested the involvement of  xxxg1108xxx  receptors in cortical gabaergic interneurons (santana
et al. 2004) based on the ability of the gabaa receptor
antagonist bicuculline to prevent the da-enhancing effect of
bayx3702 (selective 5-ht1a agonist) and the atypical
antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine in rat mpfc (díazmataix et al. 2005).
ari increased the da output in mpfc by a 5-ht1a
receptor-dependent mechanism at 3 and 30 mg/kg, with no
differences between doses. however, 3 mg/kg ari failed to
reduce the 5-ht output through the activation of 5-ht1a
receptors, suggesting that this dose preferentially activates a
subset of 5-ht1a receptors (likely postsynaptic) involved in
the modulation of da output, different from those
controlling 5-ht release in mpfc and dr (mostly,
although not exclusively, 5-ht1a autoreceptors; celada et
al. 2001). ari was active in a  xxxg1108xxx -dependent
experimental paradigm (reversal of catalepsy)  xxxd1891xxx  and
100 mg/kg (bardin et al. 2006), which is in agreement with
the doses found in this paper to elevate cortical da release
through a  xxxg1108xxx -dependent mechanism. interest-

755

ingly, a highly selective  xxxg1108xxx  agonist (f15599)
with a 100-fold selectivity over other monoaminergic
receptors (newman-tancredi et al. 2006) shows the same
regional/neurotransmitter profile. hence, f15599 increased
the da output in mpfc with an ed50 of 0.03 mg/kg i.p.
and reduced hippocampal 5-ht release with an ed50 of
0.24 mg/kg (eightfold difference; assié et al. 2006).
indeed, differences in the sensitivity of pre- and
postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors to selective agonists are
known since the early report by sprouse and aghajanian
(1988).  xxxg1108xxx  agonists tend to exhibit a higher
efficacy at raphe receptors controlling 5-ht cell firing and
release than at hippocampal postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors
(not involved in the control of 5-ht cell firing or release),
possibly due to the receptor reserve in the raphe nuclei
(cox et al. 1993). however, ari and f15599 appear to
display an opposite profile, i.e. they appear to be more
efficacious at 5-ht1a receptors enhancing da release,
possibly located in mpfc (díaz-mataix et al. 2005) than at
presynaptic 5-ht1a autoreceptors. differences in these
drugs’ abilities to stimulate the distinct signalling pathways
coupled to 5-ht1a receptors may be involved. hence,  xxxg1108xxx  receptors have been reported to be coupled to several
transduction mechanisms, such as g protein-coupled
inward rectifying k+ channels (andrade et al. 1996),
adenylate cyclase (both negatively and positively; devivo
and maayani 1985; markstein et al. 1986), microtubuleassociated protein (map) kinase (millan et al. 2001) or
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk; bruins-slot et
al. 2006). further work is clearly needed to elucidate
whether 5-ht1a receptors may exhibit agonist-directed
trafficking as it occurs with other 5-ht receptors (e.g., 5ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors; berg et al. 1998), as was
suggested (hoyer and boddeke 1993; schoeffter et al.
1997).
in summary, the present results show that ari acts in
vivo as a weak partial agonist at da d2 receptors and is
able to partially recover the inhibition in da cell firing
produced by apo. in the presence of an elevated
dopaminergic tone in ventral striatum as suspected in
schizophrenia (laruelle et al. 1996; breier et al. 1997),
ari might contribute to normalize dopaminergic transmission in this area by replacing endogenous da at a high
occupancy level (~80%) and dampening intracellular
signals due to its low intrinsic efficacy. on the other hand,
in common with other atypical antipsychotic drugs such as
clozapine, olanzapine and ziprasidone, ari increases da
release in mpfc by a  xxxg1108xxx -dependent mechanism, an effect that may contribute to alleviate the cognitive
deficits in schizophrenia.
