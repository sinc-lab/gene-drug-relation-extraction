the effects of anesthetics and ethanol on  xxxg831xxx  adrenoceptor subtypes expressed with g protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels in x...  a wide range of physiological effects are mediated by  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors (ars) through their association with g protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (girk) channels. although  xxxg831xxx -ars are divided into three subtypes (alpha2a-c), a pharmacological distinction among the subtypes is difficult to establish because of the lack of a selective agonist and antagonist; therefore, little is known about the effects of anesthetics on the  xxxg831xxx -ar subtypes. we expressed each subtype together with  xxxg1252xxx / xxxg1254xxx  subunits in xenopus oocytes and observed  xxxg831xxx -ar-mediated  xxxg1252xxx / xxxg1254xxx  currents to test the effects of ethanol, halothane, and several iv anesthetics at clinical concentrations. uk 14,304, a selective  xxxg831xxx -ar agonist, evoked  xxxg1252xxx / xxxg1254xxx  currents in every subtype. none of the iv anesthetics, which included pentobarbital, propofol, ketamine, and alphaxalone, influenced uk 14,304-evoked potassium currents in any of the receptor subtypes. ethanol enhanced the uk 14,304-evoked potassium currents, whereas halothane inhibited the currents. however, these effects were not significantly different from those on the baseline- xxxg1252xxx / xxxg1254xxx  current, suggesting that neither ethanol nor halothane acts directly on the  xxxg831xxx -ar subtypes. although none of the drugs examined had any effect on the  xxxg831xxx -ars, the physiological actions of the  xxxg831xxx -ars mediated by the  xxxg1252xxx / xxxg1254xxx  channels may be affected by ethanol and halothane.
