modeling and molecular dynamics of  xxxg1294xxx /cysteine conjugate beta-lyase.  the homodimeric, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme  xxxg1294xxx /cysteine conjugate beta-lyase (gtk/beta-lyase) has been implicated in the bioactivation of chemopreventive compounds. this paper describes the first homology model of rat renal gtk/beta-lyase and its active site residues, deduced from molecular dynamics (md) simulations of the binding mode of 13 structurally diverse cysteine s-conjugates and amino acids after amber-parametrization of plp. comparison with thermus thermophilus aspartate aminotransferase (taat) and trypanosoma cruzi  xxxg2250xxx  (ttat), used as templates for modeling gtk/beta-lyase, showed that the plp-binding site of gtk/beta-lyase is highly conserved. binding of the ligand alpha-carboxylate-group occurred via the conserved residues arg(432) and asn(219), and asn(50) and gly(70). two pockets accommodated the various ligand side chains. a small pocket, located directly above plp, was of a highly hydrophobic and aromatic character. a larger pocket, formed partly by the substrate access channel, was more hydrophilic and notably involved the salt bridge partners glu(54) and arg(99*) (* denotes the other subunit). ligand-binding residues included leu(51), phe(71), tyr(135), phe(373) and phe(312*), and pi-stacking interactions were often observed. tyr(135) and asn(50) were prominent in hydrogen bonding with the sulfur-atom of cysteine s-conjugates. the observed binding mode of the ligands corresponded well with their experimentally determined inhibitory potency toward gtk/beta-lyase. the current homology model thus provides a starting point for further validation of the role of active site residues in ligand-binding by means of mutagenesis studies. ultimately, insight in the binding of ligands to gtk/beta-lyase may result in the rational design of new ligands and selective inhibitors.
