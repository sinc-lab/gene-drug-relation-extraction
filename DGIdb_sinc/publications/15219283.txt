f-labeled non-sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent (s)-2-(2-[18f]fluoroethoxy)-4-((3-methyl-1-(2-piperidin-1-yl-phenyl)-butylcarbamoyl)-methyl)- xxxd306xxx  ([18f] xxxd3098xxx ), a derivative of the sulfonylurea-receptor (sur) ligand  xxxd3098xxx , was synthesized as a
potential tracer for the non-invasive investigation of the sulfonylurea 1 receptor status of pancreatic beta-cells by positron emission
tomography (pet) in the context of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. [18f] xxxd3098xxx  could be obtained in an overall radiochemical yield (rcy)
of 20% after 135 min with a radiochemical purity higher than 98% applying the secondary labeling precursor 2-[18f]fluoroethyltosylate.
specific activity was in the range of 50 – 60 gbq/␮mol. labeling was conducted by exchanging the ethoxy-moiety into a 2-[18f]fluoroethoxy
group. to characterize the properties of fluorinated  xxxd3098xxx , the affinity of the analogous non-radioactive 19f-compound for binding to
the human  xxxg19xxx  isoform was assessed. [19f] xxxd3098xxx  induced a complete monophasic inhibition curve with a hill coefficient close to
1 (1.03) yielding a dissociation constant (kd) of 134 nm. biological activity was proven via insulin secretion experiments on isolated rat
islets and was comparable to that of  xxxd3098xxx . finally, biodistribution of [18f] xxxd3098xxx  was investigated in rats by measuring the
concentration of the compound in different organs after i.v. injection. pancreatic tissue displayed a stable accumulation of ⬇0.12% of the
injected dose from 10 min to 30 min p.i.. 50% of the radioactive tracer could be displaced by additional injection of unlabeled  xxxd3098xxx ,
indicating that [18f] xxxd3098xxx  might be suitable for in vivo investigation with pet. © 2004 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
diabetes mellitus comprises a heterogeneous group of
disorders characterized by high blood glucose levels. two
major types of diabetes mellitus have been defined: type 1
and type 2 diabetes. although hyperglycemia is the com-

mon denominator of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the
etiology and pathophysiology of these syndromes are distinct. type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease
characterized by the selective destruction of insulin-producing ␤-cells of the islets of langerhans. when autoimmune
destruction affects more than 90% of the ␤-cell mass, the
resulting insulin deficiency culminates into the development
of overt hyperglycemia. in type 2 diabetes, on the other
hand, the pancreatic ␤-cells are initially intact, and the
disease is associated with insulin resistance and loss of
␤-cell function, and eventual insulin-dependency [1,2].

insulin secretion is regulated by the membrane potential
of the ␤-cell, which depends on the activity of atp-sensitive k⫹ channels (katp channels) in the plasma membrane
[3]. closure of katp channels due to a rise of the cytoplasmic atp/adp ratio results in a depolarization of the membrane and in opening of voltage-sensitive ca2⫹ channels.
the increase in cytoplasmic ca2⫹ stimulates the exocytosis
of insulin.
katp channels are composed of a small inwardly rectifying k⫹ channel subunit (kir6.1 or  xxxg1250xxx ) plus a sulfonylurea receptor ( xxxg19xxx , sur2a, or sur2b) belonging to
the atp-binding cassette superfamily [4]. surs represent
the target for hypoglycemic sulfonylureas, a group of well
known antidiabetic agents which have been in clinical use
for years, as well as for  xxxd3098xxx , a novel fast acting
prandial glucose regulator with a short plasma half-life (⬍1
h) [5–7].  xxxd3098xxx  is the first member of the carbamoylmethylbenzoic acid chemical family to be used in a clinical
setting, being a new chemical class of insulin secretagogues
with an insulin release profile which is very different to
sulfonylureas like  xxxd2215xxx  [8]. the development of
radioligands which bind avidly to subtypes of k channels is
an important task for k channel research. for example
radioiodinated charybdotoxin labels high-conductance calcium-activated k channels [9] and [3h] xxxd2215xxx  [10]
and 125i-labeled  xxxd2215xxx  [11] label atp-inhibited k
channels. recently, enantiomerically pure [14c] xxxd3098xxx 
was used to obtain in vivo data about its metabolism and
way of excretion [12]. a major drawback of this study, apart
from low specific activity (2–50 ci/mmol) is the use of
carbon-14 whose radiation characteristics (short range ␤⫺
particle (200 kev energy), half-life t1/2⫽5730 a) preclude a
non-invasive investigation. radiolabeled sufonylureas such
as 18f-labeled  xxxd2215xxx  derivatives have been described in literature [13] and have been proven to be unsuitable for ␤-cell quantification, most recently by shiue
and co-workers [14]. positron emission tomography (pet)
is a novel imaging technique to quantitatively assess biodistribution of radiolabeled pharmaceuticals non-invasively
in humans and animals in vivo. this method is predestined
to quantify and visualize the receptor status of diverse
receptor systems. the dopaminergic system of the brain,
e.g., has been intensively investigated by means of radioactively labeled 2-[18f]fluoro-dopa and a variety of highaffinity d2-receptor ligands [15]. however, non-invasive
investigations may become available by using a radioactive
analogue with high specific activity and labeled with a
positron emitting radionuclide, e.g. 11c or 18f. labeling
with [11c]carbon would have the advantage of obtaining a
structurally unchanged molecule [16]. for fluorine-18, the
low energy of the positron results in the highest possible
resolution for pet imaging and the nearly 2 h half-life
allows for a more complex synthesis to be carried out within
the decay time of the radioisotope and acquisition of in vivo
data can become extended. thus, [18f]-fluorine is the most
attractive radionuclide for pet imaging [17]. as the elec-

tronegative nature of fluorine can alter the electron distribution in a way that may alter the binding properties of the
molecule, the biological activity of a fluorinated  xxxd3098xxx 
derivative must be tested in vitro. if biological activity is
retained, a 18f-labeled  xxxd3098xxx  derivative with high specific activity might become a valuable tool for the visualization and quantification of human pancreatic ␤-cell mass
in vivo.

all reagents were purchased from acros-organics
bvba (belgium), merck kgaa (germany), sigma-aldrich chemie gmbh (germany) or lancaster synthesis
gmbh (germany). analytic tlc was performed using
plates from merck kgaa (silica gel 60 f254, thickness 0.25
mm). column chromatography was performed with silica
gel (si-60, merck kgaa). all solvents for column chromatography were p.a. grade. 1h, 13c, and 19f nuclear magnetic

(17000 mbq) in acetonitrile (1 ml) ethylenglycol-1,2-ditosylate (8 –10 mg, 20 –25 ␮mol) was added and heated under
stirring in a sealed vial for 3 min. purification of the crude
product was accomplished using hplc (acetonitrile/water,
50:50, flow rate: 5 ml/min rt: 8 min). after diluting the
hplc fraction containing the 2-[18f]fluoroethyltosylate
with water (20 ml), the product was loaded on a c18seppac cartridge (waters), dried with nitrogen gas and
eluted with tempered (25–30°c)  xxxd2052xxx  (2 ml) to
yield the desired product 2-[18f]fluoroethyltosylate with an
activity of 8000 mbq. after evaporation of the  xxxd2052xxx 
in a stream of nitrogen, the 2-[18f]fluoroethyltosylate was
taken up in dmso (150 –200 ␮l).

 xxxd1896xxx  (10%) and 4 h in dmem-hg plus chloroquine (100 ␮m). cells were then returned to dmem-hg

2.15. insulin secretion experiments on rat islets
for testing the in vitro function of fluorinated  xxxd3098xxx 
derivative 9 and  xxxd3098xxx  a standardized batch stimulation was performed according to a protocol established in
our laboratory [21,22]. adult rat islets were isolated by
collagenase digestion and purified by a density gradient
[23].
briefly, lewis rats (central animal facility, university of
mainz), 6 – 8 weeks old, body weight 250 –270 g, were used
as islet donors. rats were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal
pentobarbital administration (60 mg/kg); a midline abdominal incision was performed and the pancreas was exposed
and injected via the pancreatic duct with hanks’ balanced
salt solution (hbss; gibco brl, long island, ny, usa)
containing 1.7 mg/ml collagenase (serva panplus, heidel-

berg, germany). after the death of the animals, the pancreatic tissue was surgically removed and incubated for 10 min
at 37°c in the collagenase solution. mechanical disruption
of the digested pancreatic tissue was achieved by further
incubation at 37°c for 10 min in collagenase solution,
interrupted every 2 min by shaking for 30 s. the digestion
process was stopped by addition of cooled hbss plus 10%
fetal calf serum (4°c). islet purification was achieved using
a discontinuous three-phase  xxxd3253xxx  density gradient (densities: 1.090, 1.077, and 1.040). islets were cultured in rpmi
medium (biochrom kg, berlin, germany) at 37°c. the
medium contained 5.1 mmol/l (1g/l) d-glucose, 25
mmol/l hepes, 10% fetal calf serum (greiner laboratories, frickenhausen, germany), 0.2 g/l glutamax (gibcobrl, paisley, scotland), penicillin, streptomycin (gibcobrl, paisley, scotland) and  xxxd1706xxx  (hoechst, frankfurt,
germany).
for each sample ten islets were picked (equal in size and
shape) in a culture-insert with a membrane of 12 ␮m pore
size (millicell pcf, millipore, france) and incubated in a
24-well culture-plate (falcon multiwell, becton dickinson,
usa). first, basal insulin secretion was tested by incubating
the islets with normo-glycemic culture media (rpmi
1640⫹d-glucose 1 g/l⫹10% fcs) for 1 h at 37°c. after
the culture period the media were collected and stored at
⫺20°c. the inserts with islets were transferred to normoglycemic culture-medium containing 0.10 ␮m of  xxxd3098xxx  or 19f-derivative 9 and incubated for a stimulation
period of 1 h. as a positive control several inserts with islets
were cultured in hyperglycemic culture-medium (rpmi
1640 d-glucose 15 mm⫹10% fcs) only. for negative
control normo-glycemic culture-medium (rpmi 1640 dglucose 5 mm⫹10% fcs) lacking  xxxd3098xxx  or  xxxd543xxx  was used. the insulin content of each probe was
quantified by a rat-insulin elisa (mercodia, uppsala, sweden). insulin secretion was expressed as insulin release per
islet/h. the stimulation index (table 1) was calculated by
dividing insulin output during stimulation (15 mm d-glucose or 5 mm d-glucose⫹test substance) by insulin secretion during basal incubation (5 mm d-glucose). the relative
stimulation index was calculated by dividing insulin output
during stimulation with 5 mm d-glucose⫹test substance by

2.16. results
the increase of insulin secretion after stimulation with
 xxxd543xxx  was determined to be 1.8⫾0.4 ng/islet/h and
was in the same range as that of  xxxd3098xxx  (1.6⫾0.2
ng/islet/h) (table 1). these results indicate that derivatisation of  xxxd3098xxx  does not significantly alter its insulinstimulating properties.
2.17. determination of log d values
log d values were determined according to the “oecd
guideline for testing chemicals” applying the high-performance-liquid chromatography (hplc) method [24,25].
2.18. in vivo evaluation of receptor binding
the radioactivity uptake of [18f] xxxd3098xxx  in different
organs was assessed in sprague-dawley rats (charles river
wiga, sulzfeld, germany; body weight 220 –340 g; receiving a standard diet and water ad libitum). all experimentation had previously been approved by the regional animal
ethics committee and was conducted according to german
federal law. animals were anaesthetized with pentobarbital
(40 mg/kg, narcoren威, merial, hallbergmoos, germany). a
catheter was placed in the carotic artery and the jugular
vein, respectively. animals breathed spontaneously through
a tracheal tube during the entire experiment. [18f] xxxd3098xxx  was dissolved in isotonic saline containing 5% ethanol
and was rapidly injected in the jugular vein with an activity
of 15–25 mbq. at each of the set time points (5, 10, 20, 30,
and 60 min post injection) 4 animals were taken out of the
experiment and a small blood sample (⬃0.5 ml) obtained
from the arterial catheter. the respective animals were then
sacrificed and samples from different organs (heart, lung,
spleen, liver, pancreas, kidneys, and brain) were taken. the
tissues were weighted and subsequently dissolved in 4.0 ml
koh (4n) at 75°c for 30 min. the samples were then
measured in a ␥-counter. in the displacement study 4 animals were injected with 25–30 mbq [18f] xxxd3098xxx . 10
minutes p.i.  xxxd3098xxx  (0.1 mg/kg body weight) dissolved
in isotonic saline containing 5% ethanol were injected and
the animals were sacrificed 20 minutes p.i. of the [18f] xxxd3098xxx . the corresponding organs were removed, weighted,
dissolved in koh and measured in a ␥-counter.

3. results and discussion
the syntheses of the 19f-standard  xxxd543xxx  for evaluating the biological activity and the labeling precursor 8
for the labeling reaction with 2-[18f]fluoroethyltosylate
started from 2-hydroxy-4-methyl  xxxd306xxx  1. the syn-

(h) naoh/ch3oh.

thetic strategy of grell et al. for the syntheses of  xxxd3098xxx 
and related hypoglycemic  xxxd306xxx  derivatives was applied in a modified form (fig. 1) [18]. esterfication with
methanol and  xxxd3258xxx  yielded the corresponding
methyl ester 2. after side chain bromination of 2 with nbs
and azo-bis-isobutyronitril (aibn) as a radical starter, the
bromo compound 3 was reacted with nacn in water using
n-benzyltributyl ammonium chloride as a phase catalyst to
yield 4. hydrolysis of the nitrile moiety was conducted by
continuous introduction of gaseous hcl into a methanolic
solution. the bis-methyl ester 5 was obtained in high yields
and could be selectively cleaved with 2.1 equivalents naoh
to obtain the mono-ester 4-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxy  xxxd306xxx  6. the mono-ester 6 was coupled with (s)-3methyl-1-[2-(1-piperidinyl)phenyl)-butylamine 7 [18] applying dcc as a coupling agent leading to the final labeling
precursor (s)-2-hydroxy-4-((3-methyl-1-(2-piperidin-1-ylphenyl)-butylcarbamoyl)-methyl)  xxxd306xxx  8. the following reaction with 1-bromo-2-fluoroethane in acetone led
to the methylester protected non-radioactive standard com-

pound. interestingly, no formation of the 2-fluoroethyl-ester
occurred without adding a catalytic amount of nai. even
with longer reaction times, no product could be detected.
cleavage of the ester moiety was achieved using 2n naoh
yielding the final [19f] xxxd3098xxx  derivative 9 for in vitro
evaluation purposes.
3.1. radioactive labeling
the radioactive labeling of 8 was conducted applying the
secondary labeling precursor 2-[18f]fluoroethyltosylate first
introduced by block et al. [26] with an overall radiochemical yield of 20% (decay corrected to the end of bombardment (eob)). no-carrier-added (nca) aqueous [18f]fluoride prepared by the 18o(p,n)18f nuclear reaction on an
enriched water target (95⫹% 18o) was dried via co-distillation with acetonitrile applying a commonly used procedure [27]. 2-[18f]fluoroethyltosylate was synthesized via
nucleophilic reaction of glycol-1,2-ditosylate with k[18f]/
kryptofix 2.2.2 and subsequently reacted with 8 in dmso at
150°c for 10 min. after injection of the crude reaction
mixture into an hplc system the product peak was collected, diluted with water and the radioactive product was
fixed onto a solid phase cartridge, dried with nitrogen and
finally eluted with methanol. to the methanol phase containing the methyl-ester protected [18f] xxxd3098xxx , 1 n
naoh was added and heated to 80°c for 35 min. this
relatively long deprotection step is necessary to avoid unwanted decomposition of [18f] xxxd3098xxx  at higher temperatures which becomes predominant when raising the temperature up to 100°c leading to a dramatically decreased
radiochemical yield (rcy). probably the amide is cleaved
under too harsh conditions. the solution was acidified with
2 n hcl and purified via hplc to yield the final [18f] xxxd3098xxx  in an overall rcy of 20%.

 xxxd543xxx  is comparable to that of  xxxd3098xxx  (table 1).
thus, derivatization of  xxxd3098xxx  does not significantly
alter its insulin-stimulating properties.
preliminary in vivo biodistribution was assessed in
sprague dawley rats. animals were sacrificed at different
time points (5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min p.i.) and multiple
organ samples were taken. [18f] xxxd3098xxx  organ uptake in
% of injected dose/gram (% id/g) of the pancreas, lung,
brain, liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, and blood were determined (figs. 2 and 3). from 10 to 30 min p.i. pancreatic
tissue displayed a stable accumulation of ⬇0.12% of the
injected [18f] xxxd3098xxx  dose. as 50% of the radioactive
tracer could be displaced by additional injection of 0.1
mg/kg unlabeled  xxxd3098xxx  at t⫽10 min p.i., this accumulation might indicate specific binding to  xxxg19xxx .

3.2. biochemistry

4. conclusion

for testing the in vitro behavior of the non-radioactive
fluorinated  xxxd3098xxx  ( xxxd543xxx ), binding assays as
well as insulin secretion experiments were performed to
clarify whether the exchange of an ethoxy-group to a 2-fluoroethoxy-group affects biological activity. competition
binding experiments were performed to assess the affinity of
 xxxd3098xxx  and  xxxd543xxx  for binding to human  xxxg19xxx 
[19,20].
unlabeled  xxxd3098xxx  and its fluorinated derivative induced complete monophasic inhibition curves with hill
coefficients close to 1 yielding dissociation constants (kds)
of 50.3 and 134 nm and ic50 values of 99.8 and 265.0 nm,
respectively. the slight decrease in affinity of  xxxd543xxx 
may be due to its slightly higher hydrophilicity. the log d
value of 2.39 for  xxxd543xxx  in comparison to 2.52 for
 xxxd3098xxx  supports this assumption. insulin secretion experiments using a standardized batch stimulation on isolated
rat islets show that the stimulatory effect of 100 nm for

in summary, we synthesized the fluorinated  xxxd3098xxx 
derivative (s)-2-(2-[18f]fluoroethoxy)-4-((3-methyl-1-(2piperidin-1-yl-phenyl)-butyl-carbamoyl)-methyl)-benzoic
acid ([18f] xxxd3098xxx ) as the first compound for investigating the in vivo behavior of this novel class of antidiabetics
non-invasively with pet. we synthesized both the labeling
precursor 8 and the non-radioactive standard  xxxd543xxx  in
sufficient chemical and radiochemical yields. radioactive
labeling was performed in an overall rcy of 20% applying
2-[18f]fluoroethyltosylate to yield [18f] xxxd3098xxx  with
high specific activity as a sterile injectable saline solution.
the corresponding non-radioactive 19f-standard compound
9 displays binding and insulin secretion properties similar to
 xxxd3098xxx . preliminary in vivo data suggest a specific
binding of [18f] xxxd3098xxx  to  xxxg19xxx . further in vivo biodistribution studies and a first human pet scan are under
investigation.
