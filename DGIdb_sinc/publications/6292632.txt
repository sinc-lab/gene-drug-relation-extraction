summary
the binding of 3h-b-endorphin to rat brain homoge~lates,
reported by several other laboratories, has suggested unique
selective b-endorphin binding sites. we now present additional
evidence supporting the concept of distinct b-endorphin binding
(epsilon) sites in rat brain. in competitive displacement
studies, ah-b-endorphin was inhibited far better by unlabeled
b-endorphin than a variety of opiates and enkephalins. conversely, b-endorphin inhibited the binding of a series of 3h-labeled
ligands, including  xxxd1888xxx , ethylketocyclazocine, skf
10,047, naloxone and d-ala2-d- xxxg2329xxx -enkephalin, far less potently
than their corresponding ~nlabeled drug. other differenres were
also found. comparedto ah- xxxd1888xxx  and ~h-d-ala~d- xxxg2329xxx -enkephalin binding, 3h-b-endorphin binding was far less
sensitive to the reagent  xxxd2684xxx  and more sensitive to
the proteolytic enzyme trypsin. the regional distribution for
3h-b-endorphin binding was also distinct from other 3h-ligands
tested. this evidence supports the concept of a distinct binding
site for b-endorphin v~lich does not correspond to the previously
defined opioid binding sites.
the demonstration of multiple receptors for the opiates and enkephalins
(1-5) raised the possibility that specific sites might also exist for b-endorphin. recent work from a number of laboratories using both biochemical and
pharmacological approaches has suggested the existence of these b-endorphinselective, or epsilon, sites (6-12). we now present further evidence
supporting the concept of epsilon sites in the rat central nervous system.
methods
binding assays at 25°c were performed as previously described (13). some
modifications were added to the ~h-b-endorphin assay. bacitracin (50 ~g/ml)
was added to the tissue to prevent degradation and only plastic tubes were

used. nonspecific binding to glass fiber f i l t e r s was minimized by treating
the f i l t e r s with polyethylimine (0.1%) prior to f i l t e r i n g the tissue. nonspecific binding was determined in all assays as the binding remaining in the
presence of  xxxd2464xxx  (1 pm). all experiments were performed at least
three times.
results
approximately 65% of 3h-b-endorphin binding to tissue was displaceable
by opioids. although the relative potencies of the drugs varied, all the
binding displaced by unlabeled b-endorphin could also be blocked by other
opiates and opioid peptides at concentrations under 1 pm. therefore, no sites
with an absolute specificity for b-endorphin could be detected. to ensure
that the binding reflected relevant sites, we compared centrifugation and
f i l t r a t i o n assays. specific binding was the same in both techniques, ensuring
that the binding was not an artifact associated with the f i l t e r s .
in
addition, the binding was linear with tissue concentration up to 20 mg wet
weight/ml (table 1). the specific binding was time dependent and required
approximately 60 minutes to reach equilibrium (fig. 1). we therefore
routinely used 60-minute incubations.
several approaches suggested that 3h-b-endorphin bound to several classes
of binding sites. saturation experiments analyzed according to scatchard were
nonlinear and the displacement of ~h-b-endorphin by a number of unlabeled
opiates and enkephalins were multiphasic. a portion of ah-b-endorphin
binding (about 25%) was displaced equally well and quite potently by morphine,
d-ala2-d-leus-enkephalin and b-endorphin at concentrations below i nm. the
remaining binding, on the other hand, was quite selective for b-endorphin.
both morphine and d-ala2-d- xxxg2329xxx -enkephalin were nearly lo-fold less potent.
similarly, b-endorphin displaced 3h- xxxd1888xxx  and 3h-d-ala2-d-leu5enkephalin binding far less potently than morphine and d-ala2-d-leu 5enkephalin respectively. together these findings suggest that 3h-bendorphin binds to a selective site which does not bind either morphine or
enkephalin well in addition to binding to sites with high a f f i n i t y for opiates
and enkephalins.
3h'~-endorphin binding differed from that of 3h-dihxdromorphine and
~h-d-ala~-d-leub-enkephalin in other respects as well. ~h-b-endorphin binding
was far less sensitive to  xxxd2684xxx  but more sensitive to trypsin than
the other two 3h-ligands. in addition, its regional distribution was
unique, ah-b-endorphin binding levels were quit~ similar to those of
~h- xxxd1888xxx  except in the thalamus where mh- xxxd1888xxx  levels
were far higher. however, 3h-b-endorphin binding levels were different from
those of ~h-d-ala2-1eu5-enkephalin in all areas examined (frontal cortex,
straitum, thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem and spinal cord).

discussion
our results support the concept of binding sites in the central nervous
system selective for b-endorphin, although this selectivity is relative rather
than absolute. the binding of both 3h-labeled and unlabeled b-endorphin
d i f f e r s significantly from both morphine and the delta peptide d-ala2-d-leu 5enkephalin. pharmacologically, these differences are seen as different relative a f f i n i t i e s for binding sites. coupled with the regional and biochemical
results, these results provide strong evidence for distinct b-endorphin
(epsilon) sites within the central nervous system. the possible existence of
this b-endorphin-selective (epsilon) site in the central nervous system raises
a number of questions about the physiological and pharmacological roles of a
distinct b-endorphin neurotransmitter system.
