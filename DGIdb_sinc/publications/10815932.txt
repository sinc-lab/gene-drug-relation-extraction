abstract
transforming growth factor ␣ (tgf-␣) is an autocrine
growth factor for human cancer. overexpression of tgf-␣
and its specific receptor, the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr), is associated with aggressive disease and poor
prognosis. the egfr has been proposed as a target for
anticancer therapy. compounds that block ligand-induced
egfr activation have been developed.  xxxd2186xxx  (iressa) is a
p.o.-active, quinazoline derivative that selectively inhibits
the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  and is under clinical development
in cancer patients. the antiproliferative activity of  xxxd2186xxx 
alone or in combination with cytotoxic drugs differing in
mechanism(s) of action, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide,  xxxd3401xxx , and  xxxd3077xxx , was evaluated in human ovarian
(ovcar-3), breast (zr-75–1, mcf-10a ras), and colon
cancer (geo) cells that coexpress egfr and tgf-␣.  xxxd2186xxx  inhibited colony formation in soft agar in a dosedependent manner in all cancer cell lines. the antiproliferative effect was mainly cytostatic. however, treatment with
higher doses resulted in a 2– 4-fold increase in apoptosis. a
dose-dependent supra-additive increase in growth inhibition
was observed when cancer cells were treated with each
cytotoxic drug and  xxxd2186xxx . the combined treatment
markedly enhanced apoptotic cell death induced by singleagent treatment.  xxxd2186xxx  treatment of nude mice bearing
established human geo colon cancer xenografts revealed a
reversible dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth be-

cause geo tumors resumed the growth rate of controls at
the end of the treatment. in contrast, the combined treatment with a cytotoxic agent, such as  xxxd3401xxx ,  xxxd3077xxx ,
or paclitaxel, and  xxxd2186xxx  produced tumor growth arrest in
all mice. tumors grew slowly for approximately 4 – 8 weeks
after the end of treatment, when they finally resumed a
growth rate similar to controls. geo tumors reached a size
not compatible with normal life in all control mice within
4 – 6 weeks and in all single agent-treated mice within 6 – 8
weeks after geo cell injection. in contrast, 50% of mice
treated with  xxxd2186xxx  plus  xxxd3401xxx ,  xxxd3077xxx , or paclitaxel were still alive 10, 12, and 15 weeks after cancer cell
injection, respectively. these results demonstrate the antitumor effect of this egfr-selective  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor
and provide a rationale for its clinical evaluation in combination with cytotoxic drugs.

introduction
growth factors of the egf3 gene family, such as tgf-␣,
are potent mitogens for several human epithelial cell types
including breast, colon, ovary, kidney, prostate, and lung, and
have been implicated in cancer development and progression
through autocrine and paracrine pathways (1). tgf-␣ binds to
the extracellular domain of the egfr and activates its intracellular  xxxg2198xxx  domain (1). the egfr is a mr 170,000
transmembrane glycoprotein with an external binding domain
and an intracellular  xxxg2198xxx  domain (1). ligand binding
induces dimerization of the egfr and its autophosphorylation
on several tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain, creating
a series of high-affinity binding sites for various transducing
molecules that are involved in transmitting the mitogenic signaling through the ras/raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway (2). enhanced expression of tgf-␣ and/or egfr has
been detected in the majority of human carcinomas (1) and has
been associated with poor prognosis in several human tumor
types, such as breast cancer (3). egfr overexpression has been
also found in human cancer cell lines that are resistant to
different cytotoxic drugs (4). for these reasons, the blockade of
the tgf-␣/egfr autocrine pathway has been proposed as a
potential therapeutic modality (5–7). several pharmacological
and biological approaches have been developed for blocking
egfr activation and/or function in cancer cells. in the past 10
years, various anti-egfr blocking mabs, recombinant proteins
containing tgf-␣ or egf fused to toxins, and  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors have been generated and characterized for their bio-

2054 egfr blockade by a  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor

logical and potentially therapeutic properties (8 –15). one of
these agents, mab  xxxd467xxx , a chimeric human-mouse igg1 mab,
has recently started phase ii and phase iii clinical evaluation in
cancer patients (8, 16 –19). several compounds that block the
ligand-induced activation of the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  and, in
some cases, to a lesser extent that of the closely related  xxxg721xxx 
receptor have been developed (15, 20 –29). among these, various quinazoline-derived agents have been synthesized and
tested as anticancer agents in vitro and in preclinical models (6,
15).  xxxd2186xxx , an anilinoquinazoline, is a p.o.-active, selective
egfr- xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor that blocks signal transduction
pathways implicated in cancer cell proliferation and other hostdependent processes promoting cancer growth (26, 27).  xxxd2186xxx  is currently under clinical evaluation in early clinical trials
in cancer patients (30).
in the present study, we tested the antiproliferative activity
of  xxxd2186xxx  in four human cancer cell lines of different histotypes, including ovarian, breast, and colon cancer, that express
both egfr and tgf-␣. furthermore, a large body of experimental and clinical evidence has been recently accumulated on
the enhanced antitumor activity of some chemotherapeutic
agents, such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, or  xxxd3401xxx ,
in combination with specific mabs that selectively block either
the egfr or the closely related  xxxg721xxx  receptor (31– 42). for
this purpose, we also evaluated whether  xxxd2186xxx  has cooperative effect with cytotoxic drugs with different mechanism(s) of
action and with antitumor activity in a variety of human malignancies, in which egfr is generally overexpressed and a tgf␣/egfr autocrine pathway is operative.

materials and methods
materials. clinical grade  xxxd2186xxx  (iressa) and  xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ) were provided by astrazeneca pharmaceuticals (macclesfield, united kingdom). doxorubicin, etoposide,
cisplatin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel were purchased from
sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). docetaxel (taxotere) was
a gift of rhone-poulenc rorer italia.  xxxd3401xxx  was kindly
provided by smithkline beecham italia. oxaliplatin was provided by sanofi italia.
cell lines. geo human colon cancer, ovcar-3 human
ovarian cancer, and zr-75-1 human breast cancer cell lines
were obtained from the american type culture collection
(rockville, md). mcf-10a  xxxg1077xxx  cells have been obtained by
cotransfection of human nontransformed mcf-10a cells with
an expression vector plasmid containing the human activated
c- xxxg1077xxx  proto-oncogene and an expression vector plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene (43). geo, ovcar-3,
and zr-75-1 cells were maintained in dmem supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 20 mm hepes
(ph 7.4), 100 ui/ml penicillin, 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, and 4
mm glutamine (icn, irvine, united kingdom) in a humidified
atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co2 at 37°c. mcf-10a  xxxg1077xxx 
cells were grown in a 1:1 (v/v) dmem and ham’s f12 mixture,
supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 20 mm
hepes (ph 7.4), 4 mm glutamine, 0.5 ␮g/ml hydrocortisone
(sigma), 10 ng/ml egf, 10 ␮g/ml insulin (collaborative research products, bedford, ma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100

␮g/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and
5% co2 at 37°c.
growth in soft agar. cells (104 cells/well) were suspended in 0.5 ml of 0.3% difco noble agar (difco, detroit, mi)
supplemented with complete culture medium. this suspension
was layered over 0.5 ml of 0.8% agar-medium base layer in 24
multiwell cluster dishes (becton dickinson, lincoln park, nj)
and treated with different concentrations of  xxxd2186xxx  alone
and/or in combination with the indicated concentrations of cytotoxic drugs. after 10 –14 days, cells were stained with nitro
blue tetrazolium (sigma), and colonies ⬎0.05 mm were counted
as described previously (33).
immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis.
total cell lysates were obtained as described previously (44)
from serum-starved mcf-10a  xxxg1077xxx  cells that were treated
for 3 h with the indicated concentrations of  xxxd2186xxx , followed by the addition of complete medium containing egf
(50 ng/ml) for 15 min. proteins were immunoprecipitated
with mab  xxxd467xxx  anti-egfr monoclonal antibody (kindly
provided by dr. h. waksal, imclone systems, new york,
ny), as reported previously (44). for western blot analysis,
immunoprecipitates were resolved by a 7.5% sds-page and
probed with either an antihuman egfr monoclonal antibody
(transduction laboratories, lexington, ky) or the py20
anti- xxxd3459xxx  monoclonal antibody (transduction laboratories). immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (amersham international, buckinghamshire, england), as described previously (44).
apoptosis assay. the induction of programmed cell
death was determined as described previously (45) by the cell
death detection elisa plus kit (boehringer mannheim, indianapolis, in). briefly, 5 ⫻ 104 cells/well were seeded into six
multiwell cluster dishes. after appropriate treatment, the cells
were washed once with pbs, and 0.5 ml lysis buffer was added.
after a 30-min incubation, the supernatant was recovered and
assayed for dna fragments as recommended by the manufacturer at 405 nm using a microplate reader model 3550-uv
(bio-rad, milan, italy). each treatment was performed in quadruplicate. additional plates identically treated were analyzed for
cell number with an hemocytometer to normalize the values for
cell numbers, and the results are expressed relative to untreated
control samples.
geo xenografts in nude mice. female balb/c
athymic (nu⫹/nu⫹) mice, 4 – 6 weeks of age, were purchased
from charles river laboratories (milan, italy). the research
protocol was approved, and mice were maintained in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the university of
naples animal care and use committee. mice were acclimatized at the university of naples medical school animal
facility for 1 week prior to being injected with cancer cells.
mice were injected s.c. with 107 geo cells that had been
resuspended in 200 ␮l of matrigel (collaborative biomedical
products, bedford, ma). after 7 days, when established
tumors of approximately 0.2– 0.3 cm3 in diameter were detected, 10 mice/group were treated i.p. on days 1–5 of each
week for 4 weeks with  xxxd2186xxx  at the indicated daily doses.
to determine the effects of the combination of  xxxd2186xxx  and
cytotoxic drugs, additional groups of 10 mice were treated
i.p. on days 1–5 of each week for 4 weeks with  xxxd2186xxx , 2.5

statistical analysis. the student’s t test (46) and the

statistical significance of the results. all ps represent twosided tests of statistical significance. all analyses were performed with the  xxxg22xxx  new system statistical package version 1.0 for microsoft windows ( xxxg22xxx  statistical software,
los angeles, ca).

we have evaluated the effect of  xxxd2186xxx  on the growth of
various human epithelial cancer cell lines in soft agar. for this
purpose, we selected geo colon cancer, zr-75-1 and mcf10a  xxxg1077xxx  breast cancer, and ovcar-3 ovarian cancer cell
lines. all of these cell lines express functional egfr, ranging
from approximately 20,000 (zr-75-1) to 40,000 (geo),
150,000 (ovcar-3), and 250,000 (mcf-10a  xxxg1077xxx ) egf
binding sites/cell and secrete high levels of tgf-␣ (33). treatment with  xxxd2186xxx  determined a dose-dependent inhibition of
colony formation in soft agar with an ic50 ranging between 0.2
and 0.4 ␮m in all cancer cell lines tested (fig. 1a). it has been
shown that treatment with agents that selectively inhibit the
egfr, such as anti-egfr blocking mabs, have a cytostatic
effect generally with cell cycle arrest in the g1 phase (5).
however, in some cancer cell lines, inhibition of the egfr
function also caused apoptotic cell death (34, 48). we, therefore,
determined whether the  xxxd2186xxx  antiproliferative effect was
accompanied by the induction of programmed cell death. as
shown in fig. 1b,  xxxd2186xxx  treatment induced a dose-dependent
2– 4-fold increase in apoptosis in all cancer cell lines tested with
a maximum effect between 0.1 and 1 ␮m. treatment with
 xxxd2186xxx  resulted also in a dose-dependent inhibition of egfinduced tyrosine autophosphorylation of the egfr in mcf10a  xxxg1077xxx  cells (fig. 2) as well as in the other three cancer cell
lines (data not shown).
a series of experiments was performed to evaluate the
potential combined antiproliferative effect of treatment with
 xxxd2186xxx  and a wide variety of cytotoxic drugs with different
mechanism(s) of action that are currently used in the treatment
of human epithelial cancers. the effects on the anchorageindependent growth of all four cancer cell lines of three different

(c), or  xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ; d) on the soft agar growth of ovcar-3 cells. cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of cytotoxic drug

antiproliferative effect was clearly cooperative in all cell lines
examined. for example, the cooperativity quotient of the combined treatment, defined as the ratio between the actual growth
inhibition obtained with the combination of a cytotoxic drug
(paclitaxel,  xxxd3401xxx , doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, or  xxxd3077xxx )
and  xxxd2186xxx  and the sum of the growth inhibition achieved by
each agent was between 1.5 and 2.5 in all cancer cell lines tested
(fig. 5).
we also determined whether the cooperative growth-inhibitory effect of cytotoxic drugs and  xxxd2186xxx  could involve
induction of programmed cell death in cancer cells. geo and
ovcar-3 cells were treated with different concentrations of a
cytotoxic drug (doxorubicin, paclitaxel,  xxxd3401xxx ,  xxxd3077xxx ,
or oxaliplatin) alone or in combination with  xxxd2186xxx  (fig. 6).
treatment with each cytotoxic drug increased apoptotic cell
death in a dose-dependent manner in both geo and ovcar-3
cells. addition of  xxxd2186xxx  at low doses that induce little or no
apoptosis alone potentiated cytotoxic-induced apoptosis in both
cell lines by approximately 2–3.5-fold (fig. 6).
we have tested previously the effect of different novel
therapeutic agents in nude mice bearing geo colon cancer
xenografts (33, 49, 50). geo cells form moderately differenti-

ated adenocarcinomas that express both the egfr and tgf␣,
when injected s.c. in immunodeficient mice (48). geo cells
(107) were injected s.c. into the dorsal flank of nude mice. after
1 week, when established geo xenografts were palpable with a
tumor size of ⬃0.25 cm3, mice were treated i.p. on days 1–5 of
each week for 4 weeks with different concentrations of  xxxd2186xxx 
(fig. 7a).  xxxd2186xxx  treatment produced a dose-dependent inhibition of geo tumor growth that was almost completely suppressed in mice treated with the 5 mg of daily dose. this effect
was cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. in fact, geo tumors resumed a growth rate comparable with controls within 1–2 weeks
by the termination of treatment (data not shown).  xxxd2186xxx 
treatment was generally well tolerated by mice with no signs of
acute or delayed toxicity. however, an approximately 5–10%
reduction in body weight that was reversible upon cessation of
treatment was observed at the end of the treatment period in
mice receiving the highest  xxxd2186xxx  dose. although geo tumor
growth was only delayed, mouse survival duration was significantly increased in the  xxxd2186xxx  (5 mg/dose)-treated group
(p ⬍ 0.001), as shown in fig. 7b.
we next evaluated whether the cooperative growthinhibitory effect of  xxxd2186xxx  and cytotoxic drugs observed

or  xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ; e) on the soft agar growth of geo, ovcar-3, mcf-10a ras, and zr-75-1 cell lines. cells were plated in soft agar and
treated with the indicated concentration of cytotoxic drug on day 1 and with 0.05 ␮m  xxxd2186xxx  on days 2– 6 or with each agent alone. colonies were
counted after 10 –14 days. data are expressed as the percentage of growth inhibition as compared with the growth of untreated control cells. for each
pair of columns, the height of the columns on the left represents the sum of the effect of each agent and, therefore, the expected growth inhibition
if their effect is additive when used in combination. the total height of the columns on the right indicates the observed growth inhibition when the
agents are used in combination. the difference between the heights of the paired columns reflects the magnitude of cooperativity on growth inhibition.
data represent the averages of three different experiments, each performed in duplicate; bars, sd.

in vitro could be also obtained in vivo. for the combined
treatment, a 2.5-mg/dose of  xxxd2186xxx  was selected, because
this induced an ⬃50% inhibition of tumor growth after 4
weeks of treatment and was very well tolerated. this dose of
 xxxd2186xxx  was given for 4 weeks in combination with four
weekly administrations of either paclitaxel,  xxxd3401xxx , or
 xxxd3077xxx  to nude mice bearing established geo tumors.
the maximum tolerated doses of paclitaxel,  xxxd3401xxx , or
 xxxd3077xxx  using this schedule were selected. treatment of
mice with each agent significantly inhibited geo tumor
growth in vivo as compared with control untreated mice.
however, shortly after the end of the treatment with  xxxd2186xxx , paclitaxel,  xxxd3401xxx , or  xxxd3077xxx , geo tumors resumed the growth rate of untreated tumors (fig. 8). a cooperative antitumor effect was observed when  xxxd2186xxx  was

used in combination with each cytotoxic drug tested with a
significant suppression of tumor growth at the end of the 4
weeks of treatment in all mice as compared with untreated
mice or to single agent-treated mice. as shown in fig. 8,
geo tumors reached a size not compatible with normal life
in all untreated mice within 4 – 6 weeks and in all single
agent-treated mice within 6 – 8 weeks after geo cell injection. the delayed geo tumor growth in the  xxxd2186xxx  plus
chemotherapy-treated groups was accompanied by a prolonged life span of mice that was significantly different from
that of untreated controls or single agent-treated groups. this
effect was more pronounced with the paclitaxel plus  xxxd2186xxx  combination. in fact, 40% of mice treated with this
combination were the only mice alive 16 weeks after tumor
cell injection (fig. 8b). combined treatments with  xxxd2186xxx

discussion
in the last 10 years, a large body of experimental studies
have been performed to develop novel antitumor agents that are
able to selectively inhibit important pathways that control cancer cell proliferation. in this respect, the blockade of the egfractivated mitogenic pathway is a promising novel therapeutic
strategy in the control of human cancer, as demonstrated by the
preclinical and clinical development of the human-mouse chimeric anti-egfr  xxxd467xxx  mab (8). an alternative approach for
blocking egfr function in cancer cells has been the development of small molecules that are able to interfere with the

enzymatic activity of the ligand-activated egfr (15). among
the novel egfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, quinazoline-derived
drugs have been synthesized as potential anticancer drugs (6,
15).  xxxd2186xxx , an anilinoquinazoline, is a potent and selective
inhibitor of the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  in vitro and in vivo (27).
in the present study, we analyzed the effects of  xxxd2186xxx  on
cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and antitumor activity
in several human cancer cell lines with a functional egfrdriven autocrine pathway.  xxxd2186xxx  treatment produced a dosedependent growth inhibition in vitro in all human cancer cell

fig. 8 antitumor activity of  xxxd2186xxx  treatment in combination with cytotoxic drugs on established geo human colon carcinoma xenografts. mice
were injected s.c. in the dorsal flank with 107 geo cells. three different experiments with a total of 40 mice for each experiment were performed.
in each experiment, each group consisted of 10 mice. data represent the averages; bars, sd. in each experiment, after 7 days (average tumor size,
0.2– 0.3 cm3), the mice were treated i.p. on days 1–5 of each week for 4 weeks with  xxxd2186xxx , 2.5 mg/dose, alone or in combination with paclitaxel
(taxol; a), 20 mg/kg/dose, on day 1 of each week for 4 weeks; with  xxxd3401xxx  (c), 2 mg/kg/dose, on day 1 of each week for 4 weeks; or with
 xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ; e), 12.5 mg/kg/dose, on day 1 of each week for 4 weeks. for each experiment, the student’s t test was used to compare tumor
sizes among different treatment groups at day 35 after geo cell injection. tumor sizes were significantly different between:  xxxd2186xxx  and control
(two-sided p ⫽ 0.01); paclitaxel (taxol) and control (two-sided p ⫽ 0.01);  xxxd3401xxx  and control (two-sided p ⫽ 0.01);  xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ) and

lines tested. the growth inhibition induced by  xxxd2186xxx  was
mainly cytostatic, although an increase in programmed cell
death was observed with higher doses. furthermore,  xxxd2186xxx 
treatment had antitumor activity in vivo against established geo
cancer xenografts in immunodeficient mice. this effect was also
dose dependent. at the end of a 4-week treatment period with
the highest dose tested (5 mg/dose), geo tumor growth was
almost completely suppressed.  xxxd2186xxx  was well tolerated in
vivo, because it could be administered to mice for at least 4
weeks without relevant toxicity. a reversible mild reduction in
body weight was the only side effect observed with the highest
dose used. however, the antitumor effect of  xxxd2186xxx  in vivo
was reversible upon cessation of treatment. these results were
similar to those obtained with the treatment of established
human solid tumor xenografts with other types of anti-egfr
agents, such as egfr blocking mabs (13, 31–33).
we also evaluated the potential cooperative antiproliferative effect of the combined treatment with  xxxd2186xxx  and cytotoxic drugs. there was a significant dose-dependent potentiation
of the proapoptotic effect and of the growth-inhibitory activity
of all cytotoxic drugs tested by the egfr  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor. furthermore, mice were treated with weekly injections
of cytotoxic drugs and  xxxd2186xxx  for 4 weeks in an attempt to
develop treatment schedules of combined treatment suitable for
testing in cancer patients. with this treatment schedule, an
enhancement of antitumor activity was observed in vivo in mice
bearing established geo cancer xenografts when treated with
 xxxd2186xxx  in combination with paclitaxel,  xxxd3401xxx , or  xxxd3077xxx . this effect was accompanied by significantly increased
survival in the combined therapy group as compared with the
groups treated with a single agent. in fact, in established geo
human colon carcinoma xenografts, treatment with each agent
alone transiently inhibited tumor growth as the tumors resumed
the growth rate of untreated controls after cessation of therapy.
in contrast, the combined treatment with each cytotoxic agent
and  xxxd2186xxx  produced tumor growth arrest in all mice; tumors
grew slowly for approximately 4 – 8 weeks after the end of
treatment, when they finally resumed a growth rate similar to
controls. geo tumors reached a size not compatible with normal life in all control mice within 4 – 6 weeks and in all single
agent-treated mice within 6 – 8 weeks after geo cell injection.
in contrast, 50% of mice treated with  xxxd2186xxx  plus  xxxd3401xxx ,
 xxxd3077xxx , or paclitaxel were still alive 10, 12, and 15 weeks
after cancer cell injection, respectively. the combined treatment
with these selected doses of  xxxd2186xxx  and paclitaxel,  xxxd3401xxx ,

or  xxxd3077xxx  was well tolerated by mice without signs of
toxicity. therefore, in an attempt to increase mice survival and
possibly to eradicate established tumors, it is conceivable that
additional cycles of combined therapy could be administered.
the increase in cytotoxicity and in antitumor efficacy
obtained by the blockade of egfr activation with  xxxd2186xxx 
treatment seems to be independent of the mechanism(s) of
action of the chemotherapeutic agents used in combination. in
fact, an enhanced effect was found with structurally and functionally different drugs, such as topoisomerase i- or  xxxg2312xxx -selective inhibitors, taxanes, platinum-derived agents, and
a  xxxg2366xxx  inhibitor. these results are in agreement
with and extend those of previous reports that have shown a
cooperative antitumor activity for different cytotoxic drugs such
as cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or  xxxd3401xxx  when combined with antibodies generated against the egfr or the closely
related  xxxg721xxx  type i  xxxg2198xxx  receptor (31– 42). taken
together, these studies support the hypothesis that cellular damage by chemotherapy can convert egfr ligands from growth
factors into survival factors for cancer cells that express functional egfr (51). in this situation, the blockade of egfr
mitogenic signaling in combination with cytotoxic drugs could
cause irreparable cancer cell damage, leading to programmed
cell death (51).
the potentiation of the antitumor activity of cytotoxic
drugs by interfering with egfr activation may have important
clinical implications. in fact, it has been proposed that it is
possible to enhance anticancer activity by treatment with maximum tolerated doses of cytotoxic drugs in combination with
signal transduction inhibitors instead of increasing chemotherapy doses to supertoxic levels that require complex medical
support, including hematopoietic rescue (51). in this respect, the
feasibility and antitumor activity of the combined treatment of
cisplatin and mab  xxxd467xxx  in patients with advanced head and
neck or lung carcinomas has been demonstrated (18). similarly,
blockade of  xxxg721xxx  signaling by treatment with a recombinant
humanized anti- xxxg721xxx  mab (herceptin) enhances the antitumor activity of cisplatin in metastatic breast cancer patients (40).
furthermore, a randomized phase iii trial has recently demonstrated that the addition of herceptin in advanced breast cancer
patients treated with paclitaxel or doxorubicin increases the
activity of chemotherapy alone (42).
in summary, the results of the present study demonstrate
the antitumor activity of  xxxd2186xxx  and provide a rationale for the
evaluation of the anticancer activity of this egfr-specific ty-

control (two-sided p ⫽ 0.01);  xxxd2186xxx  plus paclitaxel (taxol) and control (two-sided p ⬍ 0.001);  xxxd2186xxx  plus paclitaxel (taxol) and paclitaxel

in combination with paclitaxel (taxol; b), with  xxxd3401xxx  (d), or with  xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ; f) on the survival of geo tumor-bearing mice were also
determined. differences in animal survival among groups were evaluated using the mantel-cox log-rank test. the survival of mice was significantly
different between:  xxxd2186xxx  plus taxol and control (two-sided p ⬍ 0.001);  xxxd2186xxx  plus paclitaxel (taxol) and paclitaxel (taxol) alone (two-sided

2062 egfr blockade by a  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor

rosine kinase inhibitor alone and in combination with cytotoxic
drugs in cancer patients with epithelial tumors that express
functional egfr. preliminary results of two independent phase
i studies have been reported recently (52, 53). these studies
have shown the feasibility of oral administration of  xxxd2186xxx  to
cancer patients for prolonged periods with no major toxic effects
at doses that allowed us to obtain steady-state plasma concentrations that are within the biologically effective concentrations
demonstrated in the present study.
