a deficit in gamma- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) levels in the brain or the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) is found in
many epilepsy patients. frequency and severity of seizures may be reduced by treatment with gaba increasing
medicaments as e.g. vigabatrin, an irreversible inhibitor of gaba-transaminase. for a better understanding of
the associated effects, healthy volunteers were examined with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) and
positron emission tomography (pet) before and after intake of different doses of vigabatrin. for the mrs
examinations, a dedicated localized spectral editing method was developed to determine gaba levels. the
11
c-flumazenil (fmz)-pet protocol allowed determination of gaba-a receptor binding. the results show a
clear and dose-dependent increase in the brain gaba levels after the medication period as compared to the
baseline values. the gaba-a receptor binding, on the other hand, did not change significantly. © 1999 elsevier

introduction

with several neurologic disorders including epilepsy, parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia.2,3 a drug induced increase of the brain gaba level often leads to better seizure
control in epilepsy patients.4 since gaba is not able to
pass the blood brain barrier, direct treatment with gaba is
not feasible. instead, the break-down of gaba in its catabolites can be reduced effectively by substances such as
e.g., vigabatrin [g-vinyl gaba, sabrily (marion merrell
dow, horgen, switzerland)], which is known as efficient
antiepileptic drug especially in the treatment of partial
epilepsy.4 –7 vigabatrin leads to accumulation of cellular
gaba by irreversible inhibition of  xxxg8xxx . after oral
administration, it is rapidly absorbed and renally eliminated with a plasma half life of 5–9 h typically. recovery
of its effects however requires the synthesis of new
 xxxg8xxx  enzyme, which may take several days. the
effect of vigabatrin therefore lasts for much longer than
its actual presence in the body.6,7

g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba), found in a wide range of
organisms from prokaryotes to vertebrates, is the major
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central
nervous system. in the human brain, it acts on three
different types of receptors, namely on the inhibitory
gaba-a- and gaba-b-receptors and the stimulating
gaba-c-receptors, and is present in high concentrations
(.1 mm) in many brain regions. gaba is produced
from  xxxd2431xxx  by  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase
(gad) and metabolized by gaba-transaminase
( xxxg8xxx ) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
( xxxg138xxx ) to  xxxd3251xxx . alternate sources include
putrescine,  xxxd3234xxx , spermidine, and ornithine, which
produce gaba via deamination and decarboxylation
reactions.1

magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) has proven
earlier to allow the in vivo determination of brain gaba
concentrations in rats8 and humans.9,10 increased gaba
levels were found after treatment with the  xxxg8xxx 
inhibitors gabaculine11 and vigabatrin,12–14 as well as
with the gaba-ergic agonist gabapentin.15
positron emission tomography with 11c-flumazenil
(fmz-pet) has revealed reduced benzodiazepine receptor binding in certain brain regions in patients suffering
from partial epilepsy.16,17 region size and degree of
reduction were correlated to the frequency of seizures.18
the aim of the present study was the investigation of
brain gaba activity in healthy volunteers under the
influence of treatment with different doses of vigabatrin.
a newly developed mrs editing sequence,19 which had
been extensively tested for localization performance, efficiency and linearity, allowed the determination of
gaba concentrations. fmz-pet, on the other hand,
assessed benzodiazepine receptor binding.
materials and methods
mrs
the j-coupled (j 5 7.35 hz for both couplings) mr
visible protons of gaba show resonances at 1.91 ppm
(c3-protons, quintet), 2.30 ppm (c2, triplet) and 3.03
ppm (c4, triplet). the couplings reduce the obtainable
signal strength so that the stronger overlapping resonances of n-acetyl- xxxd233xxx  (naa), glutamate
(glu)/glutamine (gln), and creatine (cre), respectively,
prevent gaba from being detected directly. instead,
editing sequences must be used which allow to selectively suppress unwanted signals and to measure the
underlying signals.
an editing sequence has been developed which
achieves localization by three slice selective pulses in
orthogonal directions. because of the larger accessible
signal, a difference method has been preferred to other
methods like multi quantum filters or polarization transfer methods, which have been reported in connection
with localization techniques earlier.20 –22
a first spectrum is collected with a sequence identical
to a fully symmetric press (te1 5 te2 5 1/4j)
sequence (‘non-inverted measurement’). in the second
measurement, an additional 2–2-binomial pulse group
(with two 180° block pulses) is inserted during the first
echo (see fig. 1; ‘inverted measurement’). this frequency selective inversion results in complete inversion
of the magnetization at 1.91 ppm, but has no effect on the
magnetization at 3.03 ppm. the phases of intermediate
magnetizations are shifted linearly.
considering spins at two frequencies (denoted i and
s), which are either mutually coupled or uncoupled (denoted c and u), the editing sequence can comprehensibly

be described in the product operator formalism.23 in fact,
ic and sc stand for the gaba c3- and c4-resonances at
1.91 ppm and 3.03 ppm, respectively, while iu and su
stand for overlapping signals originating from naa
(2.02 ppm) and cre (3.01 ppm). in the following considerations, effects of relaxation and pulse angle imperfections are neglected.

at the time of the first echo top (t 5 12/4j), i.e., after

the terms 2ixsz and 2izsx describe antiparallel states

the beginning of the data acquisition (t 5 1/2j) is

in the inverted measurement, the first half of the

is reached. then, a frequency selective 180°xi pulse
during the first echo top (t 5 1/4j) inverts magnetization
at frequency i only, but does not affect magnetization at

at frequency s only signal of coupled spins scy is visible,

for localization, the 90°x detection and the two refocusing 180°y pulses are slice selective in orthogonal
directions. simulations have shown that ideal 180° binomial pulses completely suppress outer volume signal.
however, non-ideal 180° binomial pulses not only reduce the editing effect but also introduce signal contaminations from the entire plane excited by the initial 90°x
pulse. these unwanted signals are canceled by alternation of the rotation axis of the frequency selective pulse
between x and y. to reduce influences of scanner asymmetry, this phase cycling has been extended to a cycling
of the rotation axis between x, y, 2x, and 2y. additionally, a phase cycling with four steps for the rest of the
pulses has been superposed, resulting in a phase cycling
scheme containing totally 16 steps (see table 1).
all mrs experiments were performed on a commer-

scanner (philips medical systems, best, the netherlands) equipped with a send-receive birdcage head coil.
total echo time was set to 68 ms, corresponding to 1/2j
of gaba. the frequency selective inversion in the inverted measurement was obtained by a 2–2 binomial
pulse train consisting of two 180° pulses of 0.2628 ms
duration, spaced 3.3086 ms from each other, which was
placed symmetrically around the first echo top occurring
at 34 ms after excitation. it was optimized to leave
magnetization at the frequency of cre (as determined in
the non-inverted measurement) unaffected, but to invert
completely the magnetization at a frequency 71 hz
(equivalent to dn 5 n(c4gaba) 2 n(c3gaba) 5 1.12
ppm at 63.7 mhz) lower than cre. water was suppressed
with two preceding chess pulses. repetition time was
2 s, and the adapted phase cycling scheme of 16 was
applied as described above.
the sequence was evaluated on four spherical phantoms (outer diameter 7 cm, volume approximately 180
ml) filled with a solution of 10 mm cre and four
different concentrations of gaba (0, 5, 10 and 15 mm,
respectively) in water. nicl2 had been added for approximation of relaxation times to in vivo values. a cubic
volume with 3 cm side length was defined in the center
of the sphere, and the non-inverted and the inverted
measurements were performed consecutively. for each
spectrum, 64 excitations were averaged at a tr of 2 s,
resulting in an overall scan time of approximately 5 min.
in the difference spectra, gaba concentrations were
calculated relatively to the cre signal according to

where sgaba and scre are the respective signal intensities, 3/2 corrects for the difference in equivalent protons
and [cre] 5 10 mm is the internal standard. because of
an excellent efficiency of the 22 binomial pulse train for
frequency selective inversion as well as adapted integration frequency limits, additional correction factors were
not required.
the calculated gaba concentrations in the four
phantoms were ,0.1 mm, 5.2 mm, 9.8 mm, and 14.9
mm, respectively. these results reflect accurately the
true values and are in good agreement with the linearly
increasing concentrations. measurement accuracy was
approximately 0.2 mm.

ments were determined. in the two latter, the described
phase cycling scheme was applied. the inversion frequency was set to the frequency of naa, while the cre
resonance was intended not to be affected. the resulting
signal intensities of naa and cre are shown in table 2.

as expected, the additional inversion pulse train changed
the phase of naa signal by 180°, resulting in a sign
change of the naa peak (fig. 2), while differences in
signal intensities were smaller than reproducibility errors. the comparison suggests that the localization characteristics of the press sequence and of the two described measurements are identical and no significant
signal contributions are spread into the voi. (the manufacturer indicates that for conventional press localization 99% of the signal is originating from within the
selected voi, which has been confirmed by own experiments). the fact that the inversion pulse only changed
the sign of the naa signal but not the intensity of neither
naa nor cre implies that the frequency selective inversion is accomplished with high precision and without
signal loss. this allows to calculate the difference be-

for the post drug examination, the subjects were
placed identically as for the pre-drug examination with
respect to the magnet and to the head coil. position of the
voi was reproduced with the help of anatomic landmarks on the survey images. in all cases, a good reproduction of the voi could be achieved.
after removal of the remaining water signal,24 the
signal intensity of cre was determined by integration in
the frequency domain in the non-inverted spectrum, that

of gaba was normalized with the signal intensity of
cre which had been corrected for overlapping signal of
gaba. absolute gaba concentrations were determined according to eq. (8) with [cre] 5 6.6 mm25 as
internal standard, since only variations in cre concentration smaller than the reproducibility were expected.25

without the need for questionable spectrum scaling. an
example of a phantom measurement is shown in fig. 3,
demonstrating the suppression of the cre resonance at 3
ppm as well as the editing effect on gaba.
overall, the phantom measurements indicate that the
method is highly accurate, that the single shot localization is performed satisfactorily and that the sensitivity is
not reduced as compared to conventional methods.
for the in vivo experiments, the subjects were placed
in supine position in the isocenter of the magnet. on
stacks of t1- and t2-weighted images, a cubic volume of
interest (voi) with side length 2 cm was defined in the
occipital visual cortex where spectrum quality is high
and sufficiently high gaba concentrations were expected. after the conventional preparation steps (duration approximately 7 min), the non-inverted and the

negative effects. after i.v. administration, it is distributed
in the brain within approximately 60 s. it is then further
accumulated for approximately 20 min and available in
constant concentration for another 10 min, before its
concentration is reduced with a half life time of approximately 70 min.28,29 the relatively short half life time
allows to wait for the decrease in fmz blood level before
determination of the bound fmz.30,31 for the pet examinations, the substance is radioactively marked by
replacement of a methylene-carbon by 11c, a positron

subsequently flushed with physiological saline. pet acquisitions were then measured in a programmed sequence of frames for 62 min. images of seven parallel

subjects
five healthy volunteers (male, mean age 32.6 years,
range 25–39 years) were selected for participation in
both pet and mrs studies. they were medically examined and had given written informed consent prior to
participation. they were screened for alcohol and drug
abuse, hepatitis b and hiv antibodies. subjects having
taken any medication in the four months preceding the
study were not admitted to participate.
for logistic reasons (the mrs and the pet scanner
were located in different places), the study consisted of
two periods of 5 days each. on day 1 of study period i,
a baseline pet examination was performed. on days 2,
3 and 4, the subjects took the vigabatrin as solution in
water under supervision. on day 5, a second pet examination was performed. study period ii was identical
to period i except that two mrs examinations on days 1
and 5 were performed instead of the pet examinations.
a washout period of at least four weeks was scheduled
between the two study periods. the dose levels of vigabatrin were 1 g/day for subject 1, 2 g/day for subject 2,
etc. until 5 g/day for subject 5. these values are in the
same range as used in clinical practice, where the initial
dose is typically 1–2 g/day, which is increased up to 6
g/day if seizure control is not satisfactorily achieved.

signal loss resulted.
the gaba concentrations determined relatively to
cre as internal standard are presented in table 3 and
graphically displayed in fig. 5. mean pre-drug value was
1.0 6 0.2 mm (mean 6 sem). post-drug values were in
all subjects increased compared to the pre-drug value in
the same subject and, except for subject 1 receiving the
lowest dose, also when compared to pre-drug values of
any subject. doses between 1 g/day and 4 g/day resulted
in a almost linear increase in post-drug gaba concentrations, ranging from 1.4 mm for subject 1 to 3.1 mm
for subject 4. in subject 5, receiving the highest dose,
only the third-highest post-drug concentration (1.9 mm)
was found. in a paired t-test, the increase of post-drug
values as compared to pre-drug values was found significant (p , 0.03).

as high as the baseline concentrations.

an increase in the brain gaba level in correlation to
an increased vigabatrin dose was seen up to a dose of 4
g/day. a higher dose did not further increase the gaba
level. the observed maximal concentration was increased by a factor of approximately three compared to
the average baseline concentration. these in vivo mrs
findings are in good agreement with earlier work.10,13,14
the use of the relatively small and homogeneous bird-

cage coil and of a single shot localization technique was
beneficial for signal quality and allowed the measurement in a rather small voi of 8 ccm with a standard
deviation comparable to earlier publications.10
the increased cho signals observed after drug treatment may indicate an increased inhibition of cellular
signaling mechanism caused by enhanced gaba-ergic
activity.32
the pet findings do not indicate any significant
changes in the gaba-a receptor binding by flumazenil
in the occipital cortex of healthy volunteers. thus increasing local cerebral gaba content up to a factor 3
from baseline does not influence benzodiazepine receptor binding to a large extent, at least not in healthy
volunteers within a period of three days. however, certain patients suffering from a reduced gaba level may
have an increased number of available gaba binding
sites which possibly will return to a normal level when
gaba levels are increased to or even above normal
values for a longer period of time. it must be noted,
though, that because of the small number of subjects and
the rather low reproducibility in the present study possible changes might have been missed. further studies

conclusion
reliable measurements of gaba concentrations in
the human brain are possible in relatively small vois in
a commercial 1.5 t mr system without special equipment. the obtainable accuracy is sufficient for the detection of changes in gaba concentration under the
effect of the antiepileptic drug vigabatrin. edited mrs is
therefore a suitable method for the non-invasive therapy
monitoring during vigabatrin treatment in epilepsy patients and allows to adjust the dose according to the
patient’s reaction.
pet reproducibility must be increased to detect potential small changes in benzodiazepine receptor binding.
however, the method in its current state allows the
detection of large changes as they might be found in the
treatment of epilepsy patients.
three days of vigabatrin treatment in healthy volunteers effectively increases brain gaba levels and
gabaergic activity, but does not influence benzodiazepine receptor binding to a detectable extent. for better
insight into the pathologic gabaergic cycle, combined
mrs and pet patient studies should be performed to
determine the effects of vigabatrin in epilepsy patients,
and obtained data should be correlated with seizure frequency and severity.
