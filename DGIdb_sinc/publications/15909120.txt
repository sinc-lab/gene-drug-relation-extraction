glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis may be at least in
part due to the increased apoptosis of osteocytes. to
study the role of osteocyte apoptosis in glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis, we isolated primary osteocytes
from murine calvaria for the analysis of the effects of
dexamethasone in in vitro culture. the cells were identified by morphology, cytochemical staining, immunocytochemical staining and mrna expression of phosphateregulating gene with homology to endopeptidases on the
x chromosome ( xxxg1738xxx ) and sclerosteosis/van buchem
disease gene (sost). we found that dexamethasone induced osteocyte apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. a  xxxg1601xxx  antagonist, mifepristone
(ru486), suppressed dexamethasone-induced osteocyte
apoptosis, suggesting that it was mediated by  xxxg1601xxx . immunocytochemical stainings showed
that glucocorticoid receptors are present in primary osteocytes, and they were translocated to nuclei after the
exposure to dexamethasone. addition of estrogen prevented  xxxg1601xxx  translocation into nuclei.
corresponding antiapoptotic effects in primary osteocytes were also seen after the pretreatment of primary
osteocytes with a picomolar concentration of estrogen.
the pure antiestrogen  xxxd2165xxx ,780 inhibited estrogen effect on apoptosis induced by dexamethasone. these
data suggest that glucocorticoid receptors play an important role in glucocorticoid-induced osteocyte apoptosis. most importantly, estrogen has a protective effect
against osteocyte apoptosis. to conclude, the mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis may be due
to the apoptosis of osteocytes, which can be opposed by
estrogen.

introduction
glucocorticoid (gc) therapy is a common treatment for
chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as
asthma, rheumatic diseases, and crohn’s disease. it is

also widely used in other fields such as transplantation
and tumors. hundreds of thousands of people receive gc
treatment nowadays. however, gcs have significant side
effects for instance on skeletal tissues. gc-induced osteoporosis (gio) is now the third leading cause of osteoporosis, following the postmenopausal and senile varieties, and
is the most common cause of drug-related osteoporosis.1,2
from the clinical point of view, most of the bone loss
occurs during the initial period of treatment. even the
modest doses of gcs, which are often considered to be at
the range of physiological replacement, can increase the
risk of fractures.3 in addition to fractures, long-term gc
therapy can lead to osteonecrosis, which causes collapse
of the femoral neck or proximal humerus in as many as
25% of patients who receive a high-dose or a long-term
therapy.4
the biological effects of gcs are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptors (grs).5 upon activation, they regulate
the transcription of responsive genes. the gr is a member of the nuclear receptors and an important transcription
regulator involved in diverse physiological functions such
as control of embryonic development, cell differentiation,
and metabolic homeostasis.6,7 expression of gr has been
demonstrated in developing and adult human bone.8,9
the current concept of the pathophysiology of gcinduced bone disease involves interference with calcium
and bone metabolism at multiple levels caused by both
direct and indirect effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts.10
possible mechanisms for modest increases in bone resorption in gio include decreased gonadotropin production. gcs also have complex effects on bone forming
cells decreasing cell replication and preventing the terminal differentiation of cells into mature osteoblasts.11
indeed, it is believed that direct actions of gcs on osteoblasts play a major role in the metabolic bone disease observed after gc excess. recently, gc-induced osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis has received increasing
attention.12 osteocyte apoptosis may be a direct consequence of gcs administration.13–15 although only a
limited number of patients have been analyzed, data

from experimental animal studies strongly support the
hypothesis that the primary mechanism is apoptosis of
osteocytes.
osteocyte is the most abundant cell type in bone
tissue.16 osteocytes are regularly spaced throughout the
mineralized matrix and they communicate with each other
and with the cells on the bone surface via multiple extensions of their plasma membrane that run along the
canaliculi.17,18 thus osteocytes form a cellular network in
mineralized matrix. this makes osteocytes ideal cellular
candidates for initiation of biochemical responses leading
to tissue adaptation. evidence that osteocytes respond to
mechanical loading strongly suggests that osteocytes act
as a mechanosensor.19–22 roles of pge2,23,24 no25 and
hypoxia26 among others, have been studied in this signal transduction pathway, and even glutamate signaling
may be involved in communication between osteocytes
and other cells.27–29 osteocytes may thus have an important role in regulating both bone resorption and bone
formation.30,31
apoptotic changes of osteocytes have been identified
in normal and pathological human bone.32 gc administration was found to cause a three-fold increase in osteoblast apoptosis in murine vertebral cancellous bone.
it also induced apoptosis of 28% of the osteocytes in
metaphyseal cortical bone.33 the prevalence of osteocyte
apoptosis was investigated in the femoral heads obtained
from patients with gc-induced osteonecrosis who had undergone resection of the femoral head and prosthetic hip
replacement.14 gc-induced osteonecrosis actually seemed
to be caused by apoptosis of osteocytes, which is a cumulative and unrepairable defect that would uniquely disrupt the mechanosensory role of the osteocyte-canalicular
network and thus promote collapse of the femoral head.
gc-induced osteocyte apoptosis would explain the correlation between the total steroid dose and incidence of
osteonecrosis and its occurrence after gc administration
has ceased.13 in order to study the molecular mechanisms
underlying that gc-induced osteocyte apoptosis in vitro,
we set up a system of isolating and culturing primary osteocytes from murine calvaria. using this in vitro model
system we demonstrate that dexamethasone (dex) induces a dose dependent increase of apoptosis of primary
osteocytes. we further show that pretreatment of primary
osteocytes with estrogen is an effective means of reducing
the rate of cell death.

methods
isolation and culture of primary osteocytes
primary osteocytes were prepared from 7-day-old mouse
calvaria as described previously34,35 with some modifications. in short, calvaria were dissected from mice
584 apoptosis · vol 10 · no 3 · 2005

as aseptically as possible. after removing soft tissue
and periosteum, calvaria were dipped into 70% ethanol
for sterilization, and washed with phosphate buffered
saline (pbs) several times. the calvaria pieces were incubated in collagenase solution in the isolation buffer
(type a, 1 mg/ml, roche diagnostics gmbh, mannheim,
germany) at 37◦ c for 20 minutes, for six times (fractions 1–4, 6 and 8). the residual bone pieces were further
treated with 5 mm edta (jt baker, deventer, and holland) in pbs at 37◦ c for 20 minutes (fractions 5 and
7). then, bone pieces were cut into small pieces, and
washed twice with hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss)
supplemented with 10% fbs (gibco, life technologies ltd, paisley, scotland), and cultured in the alpha-mem
(gibco) supplemented with 5% fbs and 5% cs for 24
hours in co2 incubator. the bone pieces were removed;
the cells left at the bottom were further cultured in co2
incubator.
identification of primary osteocytes
isolated primary osteocytes were cultured on glass coverslips in alpha-mem supplemented with 5% fbs and 5% cs.
after 1 to 4 days in culture, the cells were washed twice
with pbs and fixed with 3% pfa in pbs for 15 minutes
at room temperature. the cells were either stained for alkaline phosphatase (alp) with an alkaline phosphatase
kit as described by the supplier (86-r, sigma st. louis,
mo, and usa), or stained for osteocalcin. in short, the
cells were permeabilized with 0.1% triton x-100 in pbs
for 4 minutes on ice, blocked with 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa, sigma st. louis, mo, usa) in pbs either
overnight at 4◦ c or for 2 hours at room temperature. the
cells were incubated with goat anti-osteocalcin antibody
(1:100, paesel+lorei, frankfurt, germany) for 1 hour at
37◦ c. after washing with pbs for three times, the cells
were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary
rabbit anti-goat antibody (1:100, dako a/s, glostrop,
denmark) for 30 minutes at 37◦ c.
rna isolation and rt-pcr
rna was purified from different collagenase and edta
digested fractions with the qiagen rneasy mini kit
(qiagen, hilden germany). for cdna synthesis, 0.6 µg
rna from each fraction was melted at 65◦ c for 5 min and
subsequently transferred to ice. a mixture of 0.6 µg oligodt primer, 5 units amv reverse transcriptase (promega,
madison, wi, usa), 20 units rnase inhibitor (fermentas, vilnius, lithuania) and 0.6 µl of dntp mixture
(10 mm each) were added. the final reaction volume was
15 µl and it was incubated at 25◦ c for 5 minutes, at 42◦ c
for 60 minutes and 95◦ c for 5 minutes. 85 µl of water was added to each reaction. pcr reactions were done

assays for cell death/apoptosis
tunel assay. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dutp nick end labeling assay was used for
the analysis of dna fragmentation. this was performed
with in situ cell death detection kit (roche diagnostics
gmbh, mannheim, germany). in short, primary osteocytes cultured on glass coverslips were fixed with 3%
pfa, and then permeabilized with 0.1% triton x-100
in 0.1% sodium citrate for 5 minutes on ice. tunel reaction solution was added on the coverslips and incubated
in a humidified chamber for 60 minutes at 37◦ c in the
dark.
hoechst staining. characteristic breakdown of the nucleus
during apoptosis comprises collapse and fragmentation of
the chromatin, degradation of the nuclear envelope and
nuclear blebbing, resulting in the formation of micronuclei. visualization of morphological features of apoptosis
in the nucleus of the cells such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation was determined by this
assay. in short, primary osteocytes cultured on glass coverslips were fixed and permeabilized as above. the cells
were stained with  xxxd2284xxx  (molecular probes inc.,
eugene, usa) with a dilution of 1:600 (stock solution: 1
mg/ml) for 5 minutes in dark. the samples were observed
under a fluorescence microscope. 500 cells were counted
from each coverslip in turns, and the results were confirmed by visualizing the apoptotic nuclei. there were
five coverslips in each group, otherwise it will be mentioned in the figure legends.

cell treatment
primary murine osteocytes were first cultured overnight
in alpha-mem containing 10% fbs. to increase the sensitivity of osteocytes to apoptosis, the cells were first washed
twice with pbs and then cultured in alpha-mem supplemented with 0.1% bsa, in the absence or presence of
different concentrations of dex (10− 9 –10− 6 m, sigma
st. louis, mo, usa). in the nuclear translocation assay,
cells were treated with dex (10− 7 m) for 30 minutes.
in the gr-antagonist protection assay, cells were treated
with dex (10− 8 m) and mifepristone (10− 5 m, sigma st.
louis, mo, usa) for 24 hours. in estrogen protective
assay, cells were pretreated with  xxxd2037xxx  (10− 12 –
10− 8 m, sigma st. louis, mo, usa), and then treated
with dex. to characterize the mechanism of protective
effect of estrogen, the cells were also treated with ici

monoclonal anti- xxxg1601xxx  antibody (affinity bioreagents inc., golden, usa. 1:100 dilution) for
1 hour in 37◦ c. finally, the cultures were incubated
with rhodamine labeled secondary anti-mouse antibody
(jackson immunoresearch laboratories, inc. west grove,
usa) for 30 minutes in room temperature. the samples
were viewed under the fluorescence microscope (leica,
germany).

nuclear translocation assay. to evaluate the nuclear translocation of gr, primary osteocytes were incubated with
10− 7 m dex for 30 minutes and then immersed in
methanol at − 20◦ c for 30 seconds. after extensive washings with pbs, cells were fixed and permeabilized as
above. cells were washed again, and incubated with blocking buffer (1% bsa in pbs) for one hour at 37◦ c.
gr were stained as described above. to further study
the role of gr in the protective effects of estrogen
and mifepristone, primary osteocytes were treated with
 xxxd2037xxx  (10− 8 m) or mifepristone (10− 5 m) for
30 minutes before dex exposure. cells were stained as
above.

translocation of grs, primary osteocytes were incubated
either with vehicle or 10− 7 m dex for 30 minutes, or
pretreated with  xxxd2037xxx  (10− 8 m) for 30 minutes
before dex exposure. the cells were fixed, permeabilized and blocked as before. the cells were then incubated with gr monoclonal antibody and rabbit antiestrogen receptor beta ( xxxg731xxx ) polyclonal antibody (zymed,
san francisco, california, usa) at 4◦ c over night. the
samples were washed and incubated with fitc-labeled
donkey anti-mouse, tritc-labeled donkey anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies (jackson immunoresearch laboratories inc. west grove, pa, usa) and top-ro 3 iodide
(molecular probes europe bv, leiden, the netherlands)
for 30 minutes at room temperature to localize gr,  xxxg731xxx  and nuclear, respectively. finally, after mounting, the
samples were examined with leica tcs-sp confocal laser
scanning microscope equipped with argon-krypton laser
(leica microsystems heidelberg gmbh, heidelberg,
germany).

osteocytes were isolated from murine calvaria and recognized by their stellate shape. these cells retained long protrusions in a 24-hour culture in vitro. osteocyte-like cells
were the only cell type, which clearly expressed osteocalcin
and was negative or only weakly positive on alp staining.
in addition to these cells there were also some osteoblastlike cells which were clearly positive for both alp and
osteocalcin. occasionally, fibroblast-like cells were also
observed which were completely negative for both alp
and osteocalcin. on the basis of cellular morphology and
expression of markers, we concluded that osteocytes were
enriched in the fraction shown in figure 1.
in order to further confirm that the last fractions were
enriched with osteocytes, we studied mrna levels of
known osteocyte markers  xxxg1738xxx  and sost. rna was obtained from the isolated cells of different fractions during
digestion. the amount of rt-pcr products were loaded
onto gels as indicated by  xxxg53xxx  expression (figure 2).

fraction. this data is in accordance with the morphological data and thus we used the last fraction in following
experiments.
induction of apoptosis by dex in primary murine
osteocyte culture
dna fragmentation that occurs in apoptosis produces
dna strand breaks. tunel (terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dutp nick end labeling) assay is widely used
for detecting dna nicks in apoptotic cells. hoechst is
a popular cell-permeant nuclear counterstain that emits
blue fluorescence when bound to dsdna. this dye is

often used to distinguish condensed pycnotic nuclei in
apoptotic cells. we compared hoechst staining and the
tunel assay with each other to determine the apoptotic
rate of osteocytes treated with dex. both methods gave
exactly the same result (figure 3).
in the culture supplemented with 10% fbs, the percentage of apoptotic cells was approximately 2% when
isolated primary osteocytes were exposed to dex for
24 hours (data not shown). in serum-free cultures supplemented with 0.1% bsa, the percentage of apoptotic
osteocytes was 7%. serum deprivation increased significantly the number of apoptotic cells. the apoptotic rate
of primary osteocytes increased in a dose dependent manner (figures 4 and 5) when the cells were exposed to 0.1
nm–1 µm dex.
in order to distinguish primary osteocyte apoptosis
from cell necrosis, we performed a trypan blue exclusion assay. trypan blue stainings of dex (10− 9 –10− 6 m)
treated osteocytes showed that there were no statistically
significant differences between control group and dex
treated cultures (data not shown). the cell death rates
were quite low compared to the apoptotic rates. this data
supports the idea that gc principally induces apoptosis
of primary osteocytes.
to study further the mechanism of dex-induced osteocyte apoptosis, we treated primary osteocytes with
a gr antagonist, mifepristone, alone or with dex.

mifepristone has been shown to have a much stronger
affinity to gr than dex has.36 in our experiments, the
concentration of mifepristone was 1000 times higher than
that of dex. in cultures treated with both mifepristone
and dex, the rate of apoptotic osteocytes was significantly lower than that in cultures treated with dex ( p
< 0.0001) (figures 6 and 7). neither the mifepristone
treated group nor the mifepristone plus dex treated
group was significantly different from the control group
( p > 0.05). this experiment clearly shows that dex induces apoptosis of primary osteocytes and gr antagonist,
mifepristone, is able to prevent its action. the above data
suggest that gr is involved in the dex-induced osteocyte apoptosis.

estrogen protects against dex-induced
apoptosis of osteocytes
the effect of estrogen on gcs-induced apoptosis of osteocytes was studied by pre-treating primary osteocytes
with  xxxd2037xxx  (10− 12 –10− 8 m) for 30 minutes before they were treated with dex (10− 8 m) for 24 hours.
apoptotic cells were demonstrated with hoechst staining.
the apoptotic rates in estrogen pretreated cultures were
significantly lower than in the cultures treated with dex
without estrogen pretreatment (p < 0.01) (figure 8).
importantly, even picomolar concentration (10− 12 m) of
estrogen had this protective effect. this protective potency of estrogen seemed to increase in a dose dependent
manner, although there were no statistically significant
differences between the inhibitory effects of estrogen at
various concentrations.
to study the specificity of the protective effect of estrogen against dex-induced apoptosis, we used a specific
 xxxg730xxx  antagonist,  xxxd2165xxx ,780 to block  xxxg730xxx  (figure 9).  xxxd2165xxx , 780 (10− 8 m) itself had
no effect on apoptosis of primary murine osteocytes and
dex (10− 8 m)+  xxxd2165xxx , 780 (10− 8 m) treatment is
not different from dex only treated group. when primary osteocytes were treated with  xxxd2165xxx , 780 (10− 8 m),
 xxxd2037xxx  (10− 10 m) and dex (10− 8 m) together,
the apoptotic rate was almost the same as in the dextreated group. furthermore, it was significantly different
from the groups treated with  xxxd2037xxx  (10− 10 m)
and dex (10− 8 m) ( p < 0.001).  xxxd2165xxx , 780 treatment
was able to remove the protective effect of  xxxd2037xxx .
these experiments support the conclusion that the protective effect against dex-induced apoptosis is mediated
by  xxxg730xxx .

estradiol pretreatment, grs were revealed mostly in the
cytoplasm, but again  xxxg731xxx  was mainly localized in the
nuclei (figure 11g–i). these experiments confirmed that
estrogen influenced gr localization in exactly the same
primary osteocytes that express er. they also suggest that
estrogen protects osteocytes from dex-induced apoptosis
by preventing nuclear translocation of grs.

discussion
suggested that grs were translocated into the nuclei by a
30 minute-exposure to dex. pretreatment with estrogen
prevented translocation of grs to the nuclei in most of
the cells, and the staining was mainly cytoplasmic as in
control cells (figure 10e and f). the effect of mifepristone pretreatment on cellular localization of gr staining
was similar to that of estrogen (figure 10g and h).
next, we immunostained primary osteocytes with antier-alpha and  xxxg731xxx  specific antibodies. these results showed
that almost all osteocytes express both receptors. we double stained gr and  xxxg731xxx  in the very same cells using
monoclonal anti-gr and polyclonal anti- xxxg731xxx  antibodies, respectively. confocal microscopy revealed that in untreated cells gr was almost exclusively in the cytoplasm,
whereas most of the  xxxg731xxx  was located in the nuclei (figure 11a–c). when the cells were exposed to dex, there
was clear change that grs were translocated into nuclei, while there was no change in the distribution of
 xxxg731xxx  (figure 11d–f). when dex was added after 17 beta590 apoptosis · vol 10 · no 3 · 2005

on the basis of clinical and experimental studies, gcinduced osteoporosis and osteonecrosis have been linked
to osteocyte apoptosis.14,32,37,38 in these studies, histomorphometry showed that gio is characterized by a reduction in osteoblastic activity, which probably leads to
a decrease in bone formation.39 the main finding in gcinduced osteonecrosis of hip is an increased apoptosis
of osteocytes and lining cells. this may disturb the osteocytic mechanosensory network and promote femoral
head collapse.14 the number of viable osteocytes is significantly decreased in gc treated patients compared
with control patients, which observation suggests that
gc treated patients have an increased number of nonviable osteocytes.37 osteocyte death was also found in
experimental animals treated with gcs.40 the most recent data from transgenic animals showed that gcs directly induced osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis, which
results even indicated that osteocyte survival may contribute to bone strength independently of bone mineral
density (bmd).38 our results from this study support

the possibilities that the underlying mechanism in gio
and osteonecrosis is osteocyte apoptosis. this could also
explain the clinical observation that osteoporosis and osteonecrosis may also happen even after the short gc treat-

ment. our data further show that estrogen has an inhibitory effect on gc-induced osteocyte apoptosis, which
is in agreement with the idea that estrogen may have a
role in the control of osteocyte apoptosis.41

the procedure for isolation of bone cells from mammalian bone has been described already four decades ago.42
however, only few studies have focused on osteocyte isolation and subsequent culture. the main problem has
been the purity of primary osteocytes, since they are easily
overgrown by contaminating fibroblasts. we have modified the previously described method based on enzymatic
digestion34,35 and isolated osteocytes using several digestion steps. we obtained a high enrichment of primary
osteocytes. in the last fraction, almost all cells were alkaline phosphatase negative, but osteocalcin positive. this
592 apoptosis · vol 10 · no 3 · 2005

suggests that a large majority of these cells are osteocytes
since osteocalcin expression is limited to osteoblasts and
osteocytes, whereas expression of alkaline phosphatase is
seen only in osteoblasts, but not in osteocytes. in addition,
the morphology of the cells was similar to the osteocyte
phenotype. thus we concluded that the cells in the final fraction are osteocytes. in order to exclude the effect
of proliferation of possibly contaminating fibroblasts, all
our experiments we performed within four days after the
isolation of the cells. using this culture procedure, we
did not detect fibroblast proliferation in our cultures. to

glucocorticoid-induced osteocyte apoptosis

study fibroblast response to dex, we cultured primary
fibroblasts and treated them with dex in a similar manner as osteocytes. surprisingly, primary fibroblasts were
not as sensitive to dex as osteocytes (data not shown).
anyway, these results suggest that apoptosis of fibroblasts
did not interfere with our results of gc-induced apoptosis
of osteocytes.
the effects of gcs on bone have been studied in several
other species in addition to human. it has even been reported that gc-treated rats have increased bone formation
and increased bone mass, whereas the response in mice resembled that in human. therefore, it has been suggested
that the mouse is a better rodent model for gio than the
rat.1
the effects of grs have been widely studied in several
other cell types.43–45 in its inactivated state, the gr associates with heat shock proteins, like hsp90 and hsp70, and
with immunophilins to form a complex in cytoplasm.46
without a ligand the complex resides predominantly in
the cytoplasm and prevents the interaction of gr with
dna. when gc hormone enters the cell, it binds to gr
and induces a conformational change of the receptor causing its “activation” and dissociation from the protein complex. the activated gr is transferred to the nucleus, where
it dimerizes, and binds to specific dna sequences.46 two
gr isoforms, gralpha and grbeta, have been characterized
and all the receptor activity was shown to be attributed
to gralpha.47
in isolated and cultured osteocytes the intensity of
staining for grs was relatively low and localized in the
cytoplasm. it is possible that the antigenic sites of grs
complexed to heat shock proteins and other may not be
readily exposed to the antibody since even a short treatment with dex strongly increased the staining intensity,
which was then concentrated in the nuclei. this is in accordance with the established model of gr action46 in
which gr is released from the complex upon binding to
dex and then transferred as the ligand-bound receptor
complex the into nuclei.
mifepristone has both anti-gc and antiprogestin
activity.36 it blocks the feedback effect of cortisol on
pituitary secretion of corticotropin in a dose-dependent
fashion. an important point is that higher doses of
mifepristone are needed to obtain an anti-gc effect than
an antiprogestin effect.48 therefore, we decided to apply
a high concentration of mifepristone (10− 5 m) in our experiments. mifepristone opposed dex-induced apoptosis
of osteocytes but, importantly, this compound alone did
not have any obvious effect on osteocytes. this suggests
that dex-induced apoptosis of osteocytes was mediated
by gc action.
gene regulation by gcs can be positive or negative,
depending on the cell type.49 this bipolarity is probably determined by interactions of gr with other transcription factors and the complex regulatory cross-talk

between multiple nuclear coactivators or corepressors.50
despite what is known about the effects of gcs on different tissues of the body and their interaction with the gr,
the molecular mechanisms leading to gc-induced apoptosis has remained poorly understood. in thymocytes and
t cell hybridomas, for instance, gc induces apoptosis by
mechanisms, which are independent of  xxxg764xxx  (fas).51 in
monocytes, gc induces apoptosis by a  xxxg764xxx -dependent
signaling pathway. treatment of monocytes with a neutralizing anti cd95l antibody diminished gc-induced
apoptosis of monocytes suggesting that the inducible expression and subsequent interaction of  xxxg764xxx  and cd95l
play an important role in gc-induced apoptosis in these
cells.51 the cd40- xxxg390xxx  signaling system has also
an important role in immune cell death and function.52
recently,  xxxg390xxx  was reported to inhibit dexinduced apoptosis in the mlo-y4 osteocyte-like cell
line.53
estrogens like gcs have multiple effects in the human
body. the interactions between these two classes of steroid
hormones may be of importance in a number of clinical
settings. our results demonstrate that the in vitro estrogen treatment decreased the rate of gc-induced apoptosis
of osteocytes. gohel et al. showed that estrogen also prevented gc-induced apoptosis in osteoblasts in vivo and in
vitro.54 according to our results, estrogen can prevent gr
translocation to the nuclei and lower the rate of osteocyte
apoptosis. our data show that functional grs are involved
in the process, and that the signal transduction pathway
is initiated by binding of gc to the gr. recently, it has
been reported that estrogen caused a significant downregulation of gr expression in breast cancer cells leading
to a subsequential suppression of gr-mediated transcriptional activity.55
most of the effects of estrogen are mediated by estrogen receptors. to study if the protective effect of estrogen
against dex-induced apoptosis is er mediated, we used
 xxxd2165xxx , 780 in our studies.  xxxd2165xxx , 780 is a pure estrogen antagonist, which has a high-affinity to both estrogen
receptor alpha and beta.56  xxxd2165xxx , 780 completely antagonize
estrogen effect in cortical and cancellous bone and has
no effect on bone growth in young male rats.57,58 in our
experiments,  xxxd2165xxx , 780 alone had no effect on osteocyte apoptosis, but it prevented the e2 protection against
dex-induced apoptosis. this suggests that the protective
effect of e2 is er mediated. this may also at least partly
explain the beneficial effect of estrogen on bone density in
gc-treated patients. estrogen replacement therapy prevented bone loss during 1 year of observation in women
receiving long-term gc therapy.59 our data suggest that
estrogen is an important factor that influences gc action
in osteocyte apoptosis. presently, the molecular mechanisms by which estrogen exerts its inhibitory effect on
gr action remain to be determinined. however, on the
basis of our data it seems clear that estrogen is able to

modify the nucleocytoplasmic localisation of gr in osteocytes. thus, in addition to the direct action on maintaining bone mass, estrogen also seems to suppress gc
action and decrease secondary osteoporosis.
both gc and estrogen have diverse effects on gene expression. these effects are either overlapping, independent or antagonistic.60 by unraveling the mechanisms
of glucocorticoid-induced osteocyte apoptosis, it may be
possible to decrease the apoptosis of bone cells, which
is caused by gcs therapy and develop new types of gc
analogues with bone-saving characteristics. in our experiments, estrogen prevented gr translocation to nuclei,
which effect was similar to that of mifepristone. this implies that there is a cross talk between the gr and the
er. the function of gr may be modulated through ers,
which means that it would be possible to reduce gcs
side effects on bone cells by estrogen or selective estrogen
receptor mediators (serm).

conclusions
in this paper, we show that primary osteocytes can be induced to apoptosis by dex in a dose dependent manner.
gr translocates to the nuclei when the cells were exposed
to dex. this nuclear translocation can be inhibited by
estrogen and gr antagonist, mifepristone and estrogen.
our present study provides new information concerning
the mechanisms of gio. gc-induced osteocyte apoptosis
is most probably mediated by gr and estrogen protects
against gc-induced osteocyte apoptosis. this observation might open up a new application for novel serm
molecules to be used in the treatment or prevention of
gc-induced osteoporosis and osteonecrosis.
