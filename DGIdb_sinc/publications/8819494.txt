characterization of opioid agonist efficacy in a c6 glioma cell line expressing the  xxxg1635xxx .  in c6 glioma cells stably expressing a homogeneous population of the cloned rat  xxxg1635xxx , the binding affinities of opioid agonists and subsequent activation of g protein were examined. opioid receptor number in membranes of these cells was high (10-30 pmol/mg protein [3h] xxxd1913xxx  binding sites). opioids were found to bind to the receptor with high affinity [tyr-d-ala-gly-(me)phe-gly-ol (damgo) 0.23 nm; sufentanil 0.034 nm; morphine 0.16 nm]. activation of g protein by opioid agonists was examined by measuring the stimulation of guanosine-5'-o-(3-[35s]thio)triphosphate ([35s] xxxd553xxx ) binding. sufentanil increased [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding by 326% with an ec50 value of 2.39 nm. agonist stimulation of [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding was stereoselective, naltrexone-reversible, and pertussis toxin-sensitive. the "intrinsic activity" of opioids at the  xxxg1635xxx  was reflected by the magnitude of agonist-mediated activation of g protein. the rank order of the stimulation of [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding was etonitazene = sufentanil = damgo = plo17 = fentanyl > morphine > profadol > meperidine > butorphanol = nalbuphine = pentazocine > cyclazocine = nalorphine >  xxxd2464xxx  > naltrexone. high affinity binding of ligands to the  xxxg1635xxx  was reduced by the addition of sodium and  xxxd1248xxx  at concentrations used in the [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding assay. ligand affinity was reduced in a manner correlating with "intrinsic activity". damgo, 1229-fold, nalbuphine 35-fold, naltrexone, 3-fold. the results presented show that the stable expression of the rat  xxxg1635xxx  in c6 cells provides an effective tool to examine opioid receptor signal transduction mechanisms and evaluate the activity of novel opioids at the  xxxg1635xxx .
