the effects of chlorpromazine,  xxxd2961xxx , haloperidol,  xxxd1927xxx , sulpiride and sch 23390 on the potassiumevoked release of [3h]acetylchohne ([3h]ach) were studied in rat striatal slices. all 5 dopamine (da) antagonists
with d-2 blockade efficacy induced an increase of [3h]ach release whereas the specific d-1 antagonist sch 23390
was devoid of significant effects. the maximal effect (about 100% increase) was obtained with haloperidol,  xxxd2961xxx 
and sulpiride but not with  xxxd1927xxx  and chlorpromazine. interestingly, sulpiride was found to exert an unexpected
marked potency. the comparison of the activities of the 6 compounds on evoked ach release to their affinities for d-2
receptors ([3h]n-propylnorapomorphine binding sites) indicates that the pharmacological profile of the dopamine
receptor implicated in the regulation of ach release cannot be superimposed on that of the classical d-2 receptor.
participation of da presynaptic receptors could however explain the differences in efficacy observed with the
compounds studied.

1. introduction
many studies have demonstrated the relationship between dopamine (da) and acetylcholine
(ach) neurons in the striatum. the activity of
striatal cholinergic interneurons has been shown
to be modified in vivo by dopamine receptor
agonists and antagonists (sethy and van woert,
1974; guyenet et al., 1975; bartholini et al., 1976;
euvrard et al., 1979). interestingly, experiments
with striatal slices from rat, rabbit or guinea-pig,
showed that the dopaminergic modulation of ach
release evoked by high potassium cocnentration or
electric stimulation was reduced in vitro by
dopamine agonists (bianchi et al., 1979; stoof et
al., 1979; hertting et al., 1980; de belleroche et

al., 1982; helmreich et al., 1982; scatton, 1982a,b).
the antagonism by different da blockers of the
da-induced inhibition of ach release was recently described (scatton, 1982b; baumann, 1985).
however, as far as we know, such a study on the
effect of various da blockers, used alone, on
evoked ach release has not yet been done.
the aim of the experiments was to provide
evidence for an increasing effect of da antagonists
(studied alone) with d-2 a n d / o r d-1 potencies
(according to the classification of kebabian and
calne (1979)) on ach release. the possible involvement of d-2 or d-1 receptors in this response is discussed, since it has been proposed
that d-2 but not d-1 receptors are implicated in
the regulation of ach release in the striatum
(hertting et al., 1980; helmreich et al., 1982;
scatton, 1982a,b; stoof et al., 1982; hoffman and
cubeddu, 1984).

2. materials and methods

experiments were performed on male spraguedawley rats (c.o.b.s. from charles river, france)
weighing 150-200 g.

2.1. acetylcholine release
slices of 0.3 mm thickness were prepared from
the corpus striatum with a mclllwain tissue
chopper and immediately incubated for 15 rain in
krebs medium (composition in mm):  xxxg2020xxx  118,
kc1 4.2, nahco 3 25, nah2po4 1.0, mgci2 1.2,
cac12 1.3, glucose 11.1,  xxxd228xxx  0.1, continuously gassed with 95% 02-5% co2 with [3h]choline
(nen, specific activity 80 ci/mmol) at a final
concentration of 0.1 /~m. the slices were then
rinsed and 5 slices were transferred to each chamber (0.2 ml) and superfused at a rate of 0.8 ml.
min -1 with 10 #m  xxxd2264xxx . the superfusate was collected over 5 min periods. depolarization-induced increase of acetylcholine release
was obtained by superfusion with medium containing 25 mm kc1 for 1 rain at 60 ($1) and 90
($2) min after the beginning of the superfusion.
drugs were added 15 rain prior to $2 and remained in the medium until the end of the experiment. at the end of the superfusion, the slices
were solubilized with lumasolve ® (1 ml). the
radioactivity in the superfusates and in the tissue
slices was determined by liquid scintillation counting. the radioactivity measured in the perfused
samples consisted mainly of [3h]choline because
acetylcholinesterase activity was not inhibited in
these experiments. drug effects were evaluated by
calculating the ratio of the overflow (expressed as
the percentage of tissue tritium) evoked by $2 and
the overflow evoked by s1 ($2/$1). means+
s.e.m. are given throughout. the statistical significance of differences between the means was
analysed by student's t-test. sch 23390 was a gift
from schering plough corp. (bloomfield, n j). the
other drugs were obtained from various pharmaceutical companies.

2.2. binding studies
the rats were stunned, then decapitated, the
brains removed and placed on an ice-cold petri

dish. the striata were dissected out and put in
ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose containing 3 mm imidazole, ph 7.4. the striata were then homogenized by 10 strokes of the right pestle of a duncan
homogenizer. the homogenate was fractionated at
0-4°c by differential eentrifugation as previously
described (blanchard et al., 1980). the lp fraction, which contains mostly membranes and lysosomal marker enzyme, was frozen. this fraction
was used after thawing in all binding experiments.
the assays were performed in 50 mm tris-hc1
buffer ph 7.1 containing (mm): 120  xxxg2020xxx , 5 kc1,
2 cac12, 1 mgc12, 0.1%  xxxd228xxx  and 10 #m
 xxxd2850xxx . the final protein concentration was 0.29
mg/ml. after 5 rain preincubation at 37°c,
[3h]n.propylnorapomorphine (final concentration 0.3 nm) and different concentrations of unlabelled drugs were added. after 24 rain incubation at 37°c, the samples were filtered through
whatman g f / b glass fibre filters. radioactivity
retained on the filters was measured by liquid
scintillation counting. non-specific binding was
determined in the presence of 10 /~m  xxxd3356xxx . [3h]n-propylnorapomorphine was diluted in a solution of  xxxd228xxx  (0.1%) and
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (0.6%). the unlabelled drugs
were dissolved with 0.1%  xxxd228xxx  and further
diluted with the same solution.
the concentration of the drugs producing 50%
inhibition of specific binding of the labelled ligand
(ics0) was estimated graphically. the inhibition
curves comprised 6 points.

3. results

3.1. [ 3h]acetylcholine release
after 45 rain of superfusion, the release of
[3h]ach averaged 2.5% of the tissue radioactivity.
potassium stimulation induced a net overflow during the first period of stimulation (amounted to
9.0% of the tissue radioactivity). the mean of the
$2/s 1 ratios was 0.94 + 0.05 (20 experiments). under our experimental conditions, the k+-induced
release of [3h]ach was found to be completely
dependent on the presence of ca2÷ ions in the
superfusion medium (data not shown). the effect

not observed with chlorpromazine and  xxxd1927xxx . when the maximal active concentrations
were increased, a decrease of facilitating activities
was generally observed with these 5 drugs. the
d-1 antagonist sch 23390 (ioro et al., 1983)
induced no significant modification of evoked ach
release. none of the 6 da antagonists modified
the spontaneous release of ach (data not shown).

3.2. [ 3h]n-propylnorapornorphine'binding
the affinity for striatal d-2 receptor of the da
blockers used in this study was determined by
using [3h]n-propylnorapomorphine as ligand (table 1). we confirmed the high affinity of haloperidol,  xxxd1927xxx  and, to a lesser extent of
chlorpromazine, the moderate affinity of sulpiride
and the low affinity of sch 23390. moreover, we
showed a high affinity of  xxxd2961xxx  for d-2
binding sites.

4. d i s c u s s i o n

under our experimental conditions, depolarization of the striatal slices released endogeous da
from da terminals (data not shown). blockade of
da receptors must reveal an increase of [3h]ach
overflow, independent of dopaminergic regulation.
indeed we have found that the blockade of da
receptors with da blockers with d-2 activity: induced an increase of [ah]ach release.
interestingly enough, there were marked differences between the 5 active compounds. a 100%

increase of [3h]ach overflow was observed with
 xxxd2961xxx , haloperidol and sulpiride whereas
 xxxd1927xxx  and chlorpromazine reached only a
50% increase. when the concentration-response
curves were compared, sulpiride was found to be
more potent and effective than chlorpromazine
and as potent but more effective than  xxxd1927xxx . in terms of relative potency, this contrasted
with the in vitro affinities for [3h]n-propylnorapomorphine binding sites reported in the present study, in which sulpiride showed a much
lower affinity than the phenothiazine or butyrophenone derivatives.
non-specific membrane effects of high concentrations of da blockers on spontaneous and
evoked release of [3h]da were reported for rat
striatal slices (arbiua et al., 1978; miller and
friedhoff, 1979). the decrease in drug activity we
observed when using high concentration (10-5 m)
of da blockers could have been the consequence
of a non-specific depression of cholinergic neurons. however, the difference in efficacy observed
at lower concentrations (10 - 7 and 10 - 6 m ) could
not have been related to non-specific effects of
da blockers. presynatic modulation of da release during depolarization is probable; preferential blockade of presynaptic da receptors could
then induce an increase in da release which would
partly compensate the postsynaptic blockade. we
could speculate that t h e differences in efficacy
reported in the present paper might be the consequence of some differences in selectivity of da
blockers for pre- and postsynaptic da receptors.
the plateau at 50% (see fig. 1) observed with
chlorpromazine and  xxxd1927xxx  could be the
consequence of a simultaneous blockade of preand postsynapiic da receptors. considering that
[3h]da is an :index of evoked endogenous da
release, the recent results reported by baumann
(1985) using 9 da blockers are in agreement with
the hypothesis of a difference in selectivity of da
blockers for presynaptic and postsynaptic da receptors. however, the effects observed by this
author c o n c e r n i n g sulpiride, chlorpromazine,
haloperidol and  xxxd1927xxx  do not entirely fit
with our hypothesis.
concerning the inactivity of sch 23390, our
results favour the involvement of d-2 but not d-1

97

da receptors in the dopaminergic control of
striatal cholinergic activity, as previously proposed
by others (hertting et al., 1980; helmreich et al.,
1982; scatton, 1982a, b; stoof et al., 1982; hoffmann and cubeddu, 1984).
the facilitating effects of da blockers reported
here seem different from their antagonist activities
with respect to da itself (scatton, 1982b) but
relatively comparable to their antagonist activities
when the da concentration is indirectly increased
by  xxxd2746xxx  and  xxxd1730xxx  (baumann, 1985).
the reason for these discrepancies is not clear at
present.
moreover, the lack of activity of sch 23390 we
found is in contrast with a previous report by
plantj6 et al. (1984) but in agreement with the
recent result of boyce et al. (1985), 2 studies in
which the effect of sch 23390 was tested on
alteration of [3 h]ach release induced by 2 different da agonists.
in conclusion, we have observed a marked effect of da blockers on in vitro evoked [3h]ach
release. when compared with the inactivity of
sch 23390, it could be claimed that this model is
consistent with the d-2 regulation proposed previously by different authors. however, the unexpected potent activity of sulpiride and the moderate activities of  xxxd1927xxx  and chlorpromazine suggest that the receptor regulating ach release could not be assimilated to the classical d-2
receptor well demonstrated during binding studies. participation of da presynaptic receptors
could however explain the differences in efficacy
of da blockers. to validate this hypothesis, experiments should examine the effects of various
da antagonists on k+-evoked release of da in
rat striatal slices.
