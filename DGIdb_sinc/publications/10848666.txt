introduction

although the aetiology of in¯ammatory bowel disease
remains obscure, its pathogenesis is gradually being
clari®ed. it would appear that an as yet unidenti®ed
initiating factor, for example a microbial or dietary
constituent, gains access to the lamina propria, and, in
genetically susceptible individuals, provokes an in¯ammatory response, which is ampli®ed and perpetuated by
an array of pro-in¯ammatory cytokines and in¯ammatory mediators including eicosanoids and reactive
oxygen metabolites.1±4

patients with active ulcerative colitis were assessed
using rectal dialysis.
results:  xxxd3115xxx  signi®cantly reduced the release of
thromboxane b2, but not  xxxd1903xxx  or
 xxxg2296xxx -a, from biopsies (p < 0.01 for
10 lm  xxxd3115xxx ).  xxxd3115xxx  showed no direct antioxidant
activity but signi®cantly reduced reactive oxygen metabolite production from cultured biopsies (p < 0.01 for
10 lm  xxxd3115xxx ). platelet activation in vitro was inhibited
by  xxxd3115xxx  (p £ 0.05 for ³ 10 lm  xxxd3115xxx ). mean rectal
mucosal thromboxane b2 release was reduced to 86% of
pre-treatment levels in two patients treated with oral
 xxxd3115xxx .
conclusions: its inhibition of mucosal production of
thromboxane b2, reactive oxygen metabolites, and of
platelet activation, suggests that  xxxd3115xxx  could
have a therapeutic role in in¯ammatory bowel disease.

in in¯ammatory bowel disease there is evidence of
increased platelet activation.5 in addition to their wellrecognized haemostatic effects, platelets also have proin¯ammatory actions; they release pro-in¯ammatory
mediators including eicosanoids, platelet activating
factor, reactive oxygen metabolites, transforming
growth factor b and platelet derived growth factor.6±9
platelets are also involved in the activation, chemotaxis
and recruitment of other in¯ammatory cells such as
neutrophils.10±12
 xxxd3115xxx  is a dual thromboxane synthase inhibitor and
receptor blocker.13 speci®c inhibition of thromboxane
synthase but not cyclo-oxygenase or prostacyclin
synthase leads to a reduced formation of thromboxanes,

change in leukotriene production. thromboxane synthase inhibition also inhibits the release of tumour
necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1b, not only
directly through the inhibition of thromboxane production, but also as a result of an increased generation of
 xxxd1903xxx .14±16 the diversion of  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism to  xxxd1903xxx  production may also
reduce  xxxg1164xxx  synthesis, and additionally, confer a cytoprotective effect on intestinal mucosa.3, 17, 18
lastly, by reducing thromboxane production,  xxxd3115xxx 
could also decrease the generation of reactive oxygen
metabolites.19, 20
preliminary reports have suggested a possible bene®t of
 xxxd3115xxx  in patients with active ulcerative colitis.21±23
the aim of this study was to investigate the antiin¯ammatory pro®le of  xxxd3115xxx . speci®cally, we have
assessed the effects of  xxxd3115xxx  in vitro on: the production
of eicosanoids,  xxxg2296xxx  and
 xxxg1164xxx , by cultured in¯amed colorectal biopsies;
the production of reactive oxygen metabolites in cellfree and mucosal biopsy systems; and on spontaneous
and thrombin-stimulated platelet activation in whole
blood. we have also tested the effects of oral  xxxd3115xxx  on
rectal mucosal eicosanoid release using in vivo rectal
dialysis in two patients with active ulcerative colitis.

methods

patients and volunteers
colorectal mucosal biopsies specimens were collected
from 24 patients with ulcerative colitis at routine
colonoscopy. all patients gave written informed consent
and the studies were approved by the east london and
city health authority research ethics committee.
disease activity was assessed endoscopically using a
standardized score.24 active ulcerative colitis was
de®ned as scores 2 and 3 (contact or spontaneous
mucosal bleeding), and inactive disease as 0 and 1
(normal or oedematous mucosa). details of age, sex,
disease distribution and drug therapy are listed in
table 1.
for the platelet studies, normal healthy volunteers,
who had not taken aspirin or non-steroidal antiin¯ammatory drugs for at least 4 weeks, were recruited
from laboratory staff. details of age and sex are shown
in table 1.

with active distal disease, were treated for 8 days with
oral  xxxd3115xxx  5 mg in addition to their stable maintenance dose of a  xxxd2579xxx .
materials
roswell park memorial institute culture medium and
supplements used for organ culture were obtained from
gibco brl, life technologies, paisley. all other chemicals were obtained from sigma chemical co., poole,
dorset, with the exception of  xxxd3115xxx  which was kindly
supplied by dr l. van nueten of janssen research
foundation, beerse, belgium.
 xxxd3115xxx  was dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso)
and  xxxd2579xxx , in a minimum volume of 1 m
sodium hydroxide. solutions of both drugs at the
required concentration were produced by dilution in
the appropriate culture medium or buffer.
for the chemiluminescence studies, luminol was made
up as a stock solution in dmso at a concentration of
50 mg/ml, stored at 4 °c, and diluted on the day of the
experiment to a ®nal concentration of 300 lm in
phosphate buffered saline with added glucose
(5 mm).25, 26 this solution was pre-oxygenated with
95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide. for the cell-free
systems, xanthine was made up into a stock solution
by dissolving it in 1 m sodium hydroxide and diluting it
to 0.5 mm with phosphate buffered saline. it was then
diluted on the day of the experiment with the luminol
solution to a ®nal concentration of 50 lm. for those
studies using myeloperoxidase, this agent was added to
a ®nal concentration of 0.05 u/ml.  xxxg2431xxx

was diluted in phosphate buffered saline to achieve a
®nal concentration of 0.017 u/ml. the ph of all
solutions was adjusted to 7.4 before use.
effects of  xxxd3115xxx  in vitro on the production
of eicosanoids and cytokines by cultured
in¯amed colonic mucosal biopsies
organ culture of colorectal biopsies was used as
previously described.27, 28 paired fresh colorectal
mucosal biopsies (weight 2.4 mg [range 1.3±3.9 mg],
median [iqr]) were immediately gently washed in
culture medium (roswell park memorial institute)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 u/ml
penicillin, 100 lg/ml streptomycin and 5 lg/ml gentamicin. each was then placed on a stainless steel mesh
(expanded metal co, hartlepool) in an organ culture
dish (falcon) containing culture medium with  xxxd3115xxx 
(10 lm±0.001 lm ®nal concentration) or its vehicle.
culture dishes were placed in a sealed chamber with
95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide and incubated at 37 °c
for 24 h. the medium was changed after 1 h to allow
equilibration, and the culture continued for 24 h. after
this period the biopsy was removed from the mesh,
excess moisture was removed by gentle blotting and it
was then weighed. the culture medium was centrifuged
and the supernatant stored at )70 °c until assay.
lactate dehydrogenase was measured in the biopsy
culture medium following 24 h culture to assess biopsy
viability. lactate dehydrogenase measurements were
low, indicating that viability was preserved after 24 h
culture. there was no signi®cant difference between the
percentage of positive control lactate dehydrogenase in
the biopsies incubated in vehicle or  xxxd3115xxx  (4.62% of
positive control [range 4.4±13.3], median [iqr] and
6.0% of positive control [range 5±6.9], respectively),
indicating that the presence of  xxxd3115xxx  did not affect the
biopsy viability.
effects of  xxxd3115xxx  in vitro on reactive oxygen
metabolite production
luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence was used to
compare the effects of  xxxd3115xxx  with the known antioxidant effects of  xxxd2579xxx , both on reactive
oxygen metabolite generation in a cell-free system using
xanthine/ xxxg2431xxx  and xanthine/xanthine
oxidase/myeloperoxidase reactions to produce reactive
oxygen metabolites, and from paired colorectal mucosal

acid used resemble those found in colorectal mucosa
(0.2 mm) and lumen (20 mm) after standard oral
doses.29, 30
cell-free systems25
one millilitre of stock solutions of either luminol +
xanthine or luminol + xanthine + myeloperoxidase
was added to a scintillation vial which was then precounted on an autolumat lb953 chemiluminometer
(eg & g berthold, bad wildbad, germany). to this was
added 50 ll of drug or appropriate vehicle and the
reaction was started by the addition of xanthine
oxidase. vials were counted for 4 min immediately after
the addition of  xxxg2431xxx . the effect of  xxxd2579xxx  and  xxxd3115xxx  on reactive oxygen metabolite
production in a cell-free system was expressed as
percentage change in chemiluminescence, after
subtraction of the background (photons/min) compared
to vehicle alone. coef®cients of variation for xanthine/
 xxxg2431xxx  and xanthine/ xxxg2431xxx /myeloperoxidase systems were 12% (n  13) and 4.9%
(n  6), respectively.31
colorectal mucosal biopsies
chemiluminescence was measured as described previously, using biopsies freshly acquired at colonoscopy,
and in separate experiments, biopsies which had
undergone 24 h organ culture (as described
above).25, 26 biopsy specimens from colonoscopy and
following organ culture were washed in pre-oxygenated
phosphate buffered saline, with added glucose (5 mm).
fresh biopsies were then transferred to scintillation
vials containing 1 ml of pre-oxygenated luminol at a
concentration of 300 lm in phosphate buffered saline
with glucose and counted for 5 min. all vials were precounted for 2.5 min before addition of the biopsy
specimens, to measure background chemiluminescence.
in paired biopsies from the same site, either drug (5aminosalicylic acid [20 mm] and  xxxd3115xxx  [0.1 mm and
1 mm]) or appropriate vehicle was added to the vials
and the vials were immediately recounted for 5 min.
chemiluminescence was expressed as photons/min/mg
tissue after subtracting the background count. the
percentage change in chemiluminescence after addition
of  xxxd2579xxx  or  xxxd3115xxx  was compared to
that after adding vehicle alone.

810

e. carty et al.

for biopsies cultured in  xxxd3115xxx  (10 lm) or vehicle for
24 h, a single 5-min count was measured in precounted vials. chemiluminescence was expressed as
photons/min/mg tissue after subtraction of the background. the effect of  xxxd3115xxx  on chemiluminescence
was compared to that of vehicle alone.
the effect of  xxxd3115xxx  in vitro on platelet activation
the effect of  xxxd3115xxx  compared to its vehicle on platelet
expression of  xxxg2049xxx  (a marker of platelet activation)
was assessed by collecting whole blood from healthy
volunteers into syringes containing  xxxd3115xxx  (0.01 lm±
10 lm ®nal concentration) or vehicle.32 it was then
anticoagulated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in
a glass tube (becton dickinson, oxford, uk) from which
the vacuum had been released. to assess the spontaneous expression of  xxxg2049xxx , 5 ll of whole blood was
incubated with 5 ll fitc-conjugated monoclonal antibody to  xxxg2049xxx  in 90 ll of tyrode's solution for
5 min, 15 min after venepuncture and 3 h after
incubation at room temperature.33 samples were then
diluted to 1 ml and the percentage of platelets expressing  xxxg2049xxx  was measured by ¯ow cytometry as
previously described.5 to assess the effect of  xxxd3115xxx  on
thrombin-stimulated platelet activation, blood samples
collected into  xxxd3115xxx  or vehicle were stimulated with
thrombin (0.06 u/ml) to induce platelet activation but
not aggregation.34 the percentage of platelets expressing  xxxg2049xxx  was assessed before and 10 min after
thrombin stimulation as above. reproducibility, assessed by measuring the coef®cient of variation of
 xxxg2049xxx  expression during a 3-h incubation and in
response to thrombin were 16% (n  10) and 18%
(n  6), respectively.31
effect of oral  xxxd3115xxx  on mucosal eicosanoid
and cytokine release in vivo
in vivo rectal dialysis was performed before, 4 h after,
22 h after and following 8 days of treatment with 5 mg
 xxxd3115xxx  orally daily in two patients with active
ulcerative colitis. a standard method was used.35 in
brief, a 12-cm long dialysis bag (volume 4 ml; visking
seamless cellulose tubing 8/32) ®lled with an isotonic
saline-based buffer containing 10% dextran was gently
inserted into the patient's rectum. the bag was
withdrawn after 2 h and the contents emptied into a
tube and immediately frozen at ±70 °c until analysis.

eicosanoid and cytokine assays
all samples were analysed within 3 months of
collection. thromboxane b2,  xxxd1903xxx , tumour
necrosis factor alpha and  xxxg1164xxx  heterodimer
were measured in duplicate on unextracted ¯uid using
commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(elisa) kits (r&d systems for thromboxane b2,
 xxxd1903xxx  and  xxxg1164xxx , medgenix diagnostics for  xxxg2296xxx ). the inter
and intra-assay variations (calculated as coef®cient of
variation) for thromboxane b2 and  xxxd1903xxx  in
our laboratory were 18 and 24% and 6.8 and 4.6%,
respectively.31 our intra-assay variation for the
 xxxg2296xxx  and  xxxg1164xxx  kits
were 8.1 and 9%, respectively. the manufacturer's
data for interassay variation of the tumour necrosis
factor alpha and  xxxg1164xxx  kits were 9.9 and 4%,
respectively. the lower detection limit for interleukin12 was 5 pg/ml. serial dilutions of selected samples
each revealed parallelism with the assay standards and
standards made up in supplemented media. standards
made up in rectal dialysis ¯uid containing 10%
dextran solution revealed parallelism with the assay
standards if the 10% dextran solution was diluted to
one in four or more: all rectal dialysis samples were
diluted one in ®ve or more.
statistical methods
statistical comparisons between groups were made
using the mann±whitney u-test (two-tailed). paired
comparisons of the effects of  xxxd3115xxx  and vehicle were
made using wilcoxon's signed ranks test (two-tailed).
correlations were assessed by spearman's rank correlation (two-tailed). because a decision was made,
before undertaking the in vitro experiments, about
which data would be compared statistically, bonferroni's correction was not applied.36 the coef®cient of
variation was calculated as described by bland and
altman.31

(figure 1).25
ten micromoles of  xxxd3115xxx  reduced the thromboxane
b2 release from biopsies cultured for 24 h by 80%
compared to vehicle (817 pg/mg tissue [range 567±
2185 pg/mg tissue] median [iqr] and 4280 pg/mg
tissue [range 1754±6724 pg/mg tissue], respectively;
p < 0.01, n  10; figure 2). one micromole and
0.1 lm of  xxxd3115xxx  reduced the median thromboxane
production by 46% and 29%, respectively, but the data
did not reach statistical signi®cance.
ten micromoles of  xxxd3115xxx  had no effect on the
mucosal release of  xxxd1903xxx  or tumour necrosis
factor alpha. the  xxxd1903xxx  release from
biopsies cultured for 24 h in 10 lm  xxxd3115xxx  was
2903 pg/mg tissue (range 2340±13 030 pg/mg tissue), and in vehicle 4423 pg/mg tissue (2833±
10 256 pg/mg tissue; p  0.7, n  9).  xxxg2296xxx  release from biopsies cultured for 24 h
in 10 lm  xxxd3115xxx  was 59 pg/mg tissue (28±107 pg/
mg tissue), and in vehicle 96 pg/mg tissue (49±
159 pg/mg; p  0.6, n  8).
 xxxg1164xxx  concentrations in the biopsy culture
supernatant were below detectable levels.
the effect of  xxxd3115xxx  on production of reactive
oxygen metabolites
there was a signi®cantly higher baseline production of
reactive oxygen metabolites in colonic mucosal biopsies
from patients with active ulcerative colitis (314 [range
81±1129] ´ 103 photons/min/mg tissue compared to
those with inactive disease (20 [range 11±40] ´
103 photons/min/mg tissue; p < 0.0001, n  10).
in both the cell-free system and the immediate assays
of freshly collected in¯amed biopsies, 5-aminosalicylic
acid had an antioxidant effect. however,  xxxd3115xxx 
(0.001±10 lm) had no demonstrable effect on chemiluminescence in either of these systems (tables 2 and 3).
chemiluminescence of in¯amed biopsies cultured for
24 h in the presence of  xxxd3115xxx  (10 lm) showed a
signi®cant reduction in reactive oxygen metabolite
production (5 [range 3.4±8.6] ´ 103 photons/min/mg

discussion

thromboxanes are produced in excess in in¯amed
mucosa and in the blood of patients with in¯ammatory
bowel disease and may play a pathogenic role.3, 35, 37, 88

figure 3. effect of  xxxd3115xxx  (10 lm) and
vehicle on reactive oxygen metabolite production (expressed as photons ´ 103 per
min per mg tissue) by in¯amed mucosal
biopsies after 24 h organ culture. individual data points are shown as well as the
median (iqr).

in vitro studies have shown that thromboxanes activate
neutrophils, and enhance their adhesion to endothelium and subsequent diapedesis.39±41 neutrophil production of ltb4 and apoptosis are induced by thromboxane,
which also modulates t cell function and may have a
role in ischaemia-reperfusion injury.42±45 thromboxanes stimulate platelet aggregation as well as vasoconstriction.46, 47 in patients with active in¯ammatory
bowel disease, platelets are activated and show abnormal aggregation.5, 48 furthermore, platelet aggregates
have been identi®ed in the capillaries in in¯amed rectal
biopsies in in¯ammatory bowel disease and microvascular thrombosis has been proposed as a pathogenetic
factor in crohn's disease.49, 50
we have con®rmed that the colorectal mucosal
production of thromboxane b2 is increased in proportion to disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis
and have now shown that  xxxd3115xxx  reduces thromboxane b2 production by in¯amed colonic mucosal biopsies
cultured in vitro for 24 h.3, 35, 38 this result was
mirrored in vivo in experiments using rectal dialysis in
two patients with active ulcerative colitis given the
recommended standard dose of  xxxd3115xxx  orally. in vitro,
 xxxd3115xxx  also inhibited reactive oxygen metabolite
production of mucosal biopsies, measured by chemiluminescence, following prolonged organ culture, but it
had no direct antioxidant properties in the cell-free
system.  xxxd3115xxx  also inhibited both spontaneous and
thrombin-induced platelet activation in vitro.
ó 2000 blackwell science ltd, aliment pharmacol ther 14, 807±817

after the recommended standard oral dose of  xxxd3115xxx 
(5 mg daily), pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers have demonstrated peak plasma concentrations
of 0.3 lm  xxxd3115xxx  (p.t. leese, unpublished data). there
are no data on intestinal mucosal or luminal drug
concentrations. inhibition by  xxxd3115xxx  in vitro of thromboxane production by mucosal biopsies appeared to
show a dose-dependent effect. however, signi®cant
effects compared to vehicle were found only  xxxd1891xxx  lm
 xxxd3115xxx . although the in vitro effects in the present
work were obtained with 10-fold higher concentrations
of  xxxd3115xxx  than are routinely achieved in vivo in blood,
our rectal dialysis studies, in which  xxxd3115xxx  was given
orally, give broadly similar results.
we have con®rmed an increased production of tumour
necrosis factor alpha by in¯amed colorectal biopsies.51
the production of the pro-in¯ammatory cytokines
 xxxg2296xxx  and  xxxg1164xxx  is
increased by thromboxane synthase and reduced by
 xxxd1903xxx  in isolated peripheral blood cells.15, 18
however, there are many factors, both endogenous
(such as other cytokines) and exogenous (such as
bacterial antigens), contributing to control of the
production of  xxxg2296xxx . it is
conceivable that the effects of these outweighed any
inhibitory effect of reduced thromboxane synthesis in

an earlier one using colonic perfusion, it is unsurprising
that  xxxg2296xxx  release was not
suppressed by the drug using this mechanism.21

 xxxg1164xxx  is released by monocytes, initiates type
1 t-helper immune responses and suppresses the
development of type 2 t-helper responses.52 antibodies
to  xxxg1164xxx  abrogate in¯ammation in trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-induced colitis in mice.53 in crohn's
disease, the up-regulation of expression of interleukin12 mrna, which has been reported in lamina propria macrophages, is consistent with the view that
crohn's disease is primarily associated with a type 1
t-helper cytokine response.54, 55 conversely, the
cytokine response in ulcerative colitis is primarily type
2 t-helper, and raised mucosal  xxxg1164xxx  levels
would not be predicted.56 unfortunately, the amounts of
 xxxg1164xxx  produced by in¯amed colorectal biopsies
in our studies were below detectable levels and we
cannot therefore draw any conclusions about whether
 xxxd3115xxx  has any effect on the mucosal production of this
cytokine.
reactive oxygen metabolites (e.g. superoxide,  xxxd2298xxx  hypochlorite and hydroxyl radical) are
species produced by the progressive univalent reduction
of molecular oxygen and are the most abundant free
radicals in biological systems. we have again shown
here that in¯amed colorectal mucosa from patients with
active in¯ammatory bowel disease produces excess
reactive oxygen metabolites;4, 20, 57 this is probably as
a result of leucocyte activation, ischaemia/reperfusion
type injury and  xxxd208xxx  metabolism.19, 20, 51, 59
because reactive oxygen metabolite production is
associated with eicosanoid biosynthesis at several levels
in the pathway, we hypothesized that the inhibition of
thromboxane synthesis in colorectal biopsies by  xxxd3115xxx 
might decrease reactive oxygen metabolite production.19
the failure of  xxxd3115xxx  to reduce chemiluminescence in
the cell-free system indicates that, unlike  xxxd2579xxx  at a concentration found in colorectal mucosa,
it has no direct antioxidant activity.29 its failure to
inhibit chemiluminescence produced by fresh biopsies
may be due to an insuf®cient time for the drug to
adequately penetrate the tissue and/or alter eicosanoid
metabolism. this explanation is supported by the results
of the experiments in which in¯amed biopsies were

cultured for 24 h; in these,  xxxd3115xxx  signi®cantly reduced
the generation of reactive oxygen metabolites, suggesting that it has an indirect antioxidant effect through the
inhibition of thromboxane synthesis.
enhanced platelet activation has been reported in
patients with in¯ammatory bowel disease.5, 60 the
mechanism of thrombin-stimulated and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression is
not fully de®ned, but  xxxd3115xxx 's inhibitory effects in our
studies support the hypothesis that both processes are at
least in part thromboxane-dependent.61, 62
in these studies we have shown that  xxxd3115xxx  not only
inhibits an increased production of thromboxane by
in¯amed colorectal mucosal biopsies in vitro and in vivo,
but also reduces mucosal generation of reactive oxygen
metabolites after prolonged incubation, and inhibits
platelet activation. its pro®le of anti-in¯ammatory
effects could account for the reported bene®cial actions
of  xxxd3115xxx  in preliminary trials in active ulcerative
colitis.21±23 conversely, if clinical bene®t is not con®rmed in controlled trials, we would conclude that, if
mucosal thromboxanes and platelet activation are to be
targeted for drug development in the future, more
potent agents must be devised.
