molecular pathogenesis of

introduction: recent progress in identifying distinct subsets of lung cancer,
based on critical driver mutations, has led to increasingly focused efforts in
the development of selectively targeted therapies. the fusion oncogene,  xxxg700xxx  --  xxxg144xxx 
( xxxg700xxx -alk), is present in approximately 5% of non-small-cell lung cancer
(nsclc) tumors.  xxxd1761xxx  is an oral  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (tki), which
silences the protein product of the alk fusion gene and has recently been
approved for the treatment of nsclc aberrantly expressing alk. emerging
data suggest that  xxxd1761xxx  may also have activity in other subsets of lung
cancer, including tumors demonstrating amplification or mutation of the
met oncogene, or translocation of the  xxxg1973xxx  oncogene.
areas covered: this paper gives an overview of the molecular pathogenesis of
alk-associated nsclc. it also reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on  xxxd1761xxx  and outlines the preclinical and clinical studies
leading to the approval of  xxxd1761xxx . in addition, it discusses its role in the
treatment of nsclc expressing alk.
expert opinion:  xxxd1761xxx  represents the newest example of a focused
strategy for drug development in lung cancer, based on identification and
targeted inhibition of critical tumor-specific driver mutations.  xxxd1761xxx  has
demonstrated efficacy against alk-rearranged nsclc, and has potential for
broader application in select subsets of lung cancer.

background

lung cancer is the most common invasive cancer and cause of cancer death worldwide. in 2008, the most recent year for which global statistics are available, there
were an estimated 1.61 million cases and 1.38 million deaths [1]. in the united
states, according to 2011 estimates, more people die from lung cancer than from
breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers combined [2]. while recent developments
in ct screening for nsclc may lead to detection of tumors at earlier stages [3],
currently over 70% of lung cancers are loco-regionally advanced or metastatic at
diagnosis [4]. this portends a poor prognosis, a median survival with chemotherapy
for histologically unselected stage iiib and iv disease of approximately 10 months [5].
throughout the first 40 years of systemic therapy for advanced nsclc, histology,
while to some extent prognostic, was not regarded as useful in guiding the use of
chemotherapeutic agents in clinical practice.
more recently the importance of histology in predicting response to therapy has
become clear, in particular non-squamous histology is associated with prolonged
response to  xxxd2868xxx -based platinum doublet chemotherapy as well as potential
benefit from the addition of the  xxxd328xxx  antibody, bevacizumab, to standard
chemotherapy [5,6].

pharmacology of  xxxd1761xxx , the data which have led to its
approval for use in alk-positive nsclc, and some future
considerations for investigation with this agent.
2.

overview of the market

current management of advanced nsclc has the dual goal
of prolongation of life and palliation of disease and
treatment-related symptoms. selection of systemic therapy is
guided by patient performance status, end-organ function,
tumor histology, and mutational analysis.
activating mutations of egfr should be assessed in the
tumors of patients for whom first-line therapy with an
egfr tki such as  xxxd2029xxx  is being considered [9]. of note
approximately 15% of patients with adenocarcinoma histology will have an egfr mutation; these mutations are rare
in patients with squamous histology and as a general rule
appear to be mutually exclusive with alk mutations [10].
patients with sensitizing mutations of egfr have been
reported to have improved survival and quality of life
when treated with a first-line egfr tki compared with
carboplatin/paclitaxel [8].
platinum doublet chemotherapy, consisting of cisplatin or
carboplatin as a backbone combined with any one of gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or paclitaxel has been an accepted firstline standard for egfr mutation-negative patients with
good performance status giving a higher response rate and
marginal survival advantage over non-platinum-based
1196

treatment [11]. patients with specific contraindications to
platinum such as renal dysfunction may be treated with
non-platinum single agent or double agent chemotherapy.
the discovery that certain mutations in egfr select for
high response rates and prolonged survival with egfr tkis
spurred the search for additional driver mutations in nsclc.
the alk fusion oncogene is the second molecular aberration
in nsclc for which a targeted therapy has achieved
regulatory approval.

molecular pathogenesis of the alk fusion
oncogene

3.

the attractive idea of a driver oncogene, which if specifically
targeted could lead to rapid tumor regression, had its first
clinical application when the oral  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor
imatinib, targeting the bcr-abl fusion gene (philadelphia
chromosome), demonstrated dramatic responses and durable
remissions in chronic myeloid leukemia leading to food
and drug administration (fda) approval in 2001 [12]. of
note, the philadelphia chromosome had initially been
described in 1971 as being associated with chronic myeloid
leukemia [13].
an alk fusion gene was first described as a putative oncogenic factor in a subtype of non-hodgkin lymphoma in
1994 with fusion of the npm gene on chromosome 5q35
to the protein  xxxg2198xxx  gene, alk, on chromosome
2p23 [14].
in 2007 the  xxxg700xxx -alk fusion oncogene was reported in
nsclc, the oncogene arising from an inversion on the short
arm of chromosome 2 joining exons 1 -- 13 of  xxxg700xxx  to exons
20 -- 29 of alk [15].  xxxg700xxx  is an echinoderm microtubuleassociated protein-like protein and is necessary for correct
microtubule formation in cells [16]. the normal alk gene
product is a receptor protein  xxxg2198xxx  with transmembrane and extracellular domains, is expressed in testis, intestinal and neural tissue, and has an important role in nervous
system development [17]. the abnormal  xxxg700xxx -alk fusion
gene leads to ligand-independent dimerization of the alk
kinase domain and consequent permanent cellular proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis through downstream activation of oncogenic signaling pathways, in particular map
kinase and  xxxg1743xxx  kinase. the  xxxg700xxx -alk fusion gene has
been shown to be a potent driver of oncogenesis both
in vitro and in mouse models [15]. multiple isoforms of the
 xxxg700xxx -alk fusion gene have been described with variability
in the  xxxg700xxx  element, but with preservation of the alk cytoplasmic portion [18]. fusion of alk with other partners has
also been described, but is rare [19,20]. the alk fusion gene
has also been described in the rare sarcoma, inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumor [21] while mutations and amplifications
have been described in the aggressive childhood tumor,
neuroblastoma [22].
given the rapid advances in small-molecule tki
development since the development of imatinib,  xxxg700xxx -alk

 xxxd1761xxx  ( xxxd1761xxx )

was an obvious therapeutic target, being unique to the tumor
cell and present in 2 -- 7% of unselected nsclc tumors [10].
this would suggest an incidence of alk-positive lung cancer
in the usa similar to that of chronic myeloid leukemia [4].
in selected nsclc patient cohorts enriched for certain
clinical characteristics, the incidence of alk translocation is
substantially higher [23]. in patients who had two or more of
the following criteria -- female sex, asian ethnicity, never/light
smoker, adenocarcinoma histology, 13% of 141 tumors
analyzed demonstrated alk positivity. alk-positive patients
were also younger (median age 52) and more likely to have
signet ring histology than alk-negative patients.
the 30-year gap between oncogene discovery and targeted
therapy approval that occurred with philadelphia chromosome and imatinib was reduced 10-fold in the case of
 xxxg700xxx -alk-targeted therapy, serving as a testament to the
increasingly rapid pace of intelligent drug development in
the past 20 years.

development of  xxxd1761xxx 

 xxxd1761xxx  ( xxxd1761xxx ,  xxxd1761xxx  pfizer) (box 1) is a potent
and selective atp-competitive inhibitor of both alk and the
c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition/ xxxg1044xxx 
(c-met/hgf) receptor  xxxg2198xxx  [24]. initial development of the drug was aimed at utilizing its c-met inhibitory
activity as mutations in this pathway are implicated in the
progression of many human cancers.
 xxxd1761xxx  was developed using structure-based drug design
as an orally available and clinically useful alternative to
another compound,  xxxd2895xxx , which was not feasible
for clinical use due to its pharmacological properties [25].

pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
review

5.

in a dose-finding study of  xxxd1761xxx  in patients with
pancreatic, colorectal, sarcoma, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma
and nsclc, mean auc and cmax increased proportionally
with dose from 100 mg qd to 300 mg bid po with moderate
inter-subject variability (cv 30 -- 69%) [26]. the median terminal half-life was 46 h with a half-life of 53 h for the 250 mg bid
dose level this study also included a cohort looking at
cyp3a4 inhibition: a two- to fourfold increase in oral midazolam auc was observed following 28 days of  xxxd1761xxx  dosing
at 100 mg qd (n = 3) and 300 mg bid (n = 2), respectively,
suggesting that  xxxd1761xxx  is a moderate inhibitor of cyp3a4.
6.

 xxxd1761xxx  demonstrated significant cytoreductive antitumor
activity in c-met-amplified cell lines in vitro and in
c-met-amplified animal models and human tumor xenograft
models [28].
studies using nsclc cell lines containing the alk fusion
gene rearrangement resulted in similar efficacy at clinically
achievable doses of  xxxd1761xxx  [29]. cell lines demonstrated
g1-s phase arrest and apoptosis following treatment.
oral administration of  xxxd1761xxx  to severe combined
immunodeficient-beige mice bearing karpas299 anaplastic
large-cell lymphoma tumor xenografts resulted in dosedependent antitumor efficacy with complete regression of all
tumors within 15 days of commencing administration [30].
in general, preclinical toxicity was mild when  xxxd1761xxx  was
administered to mice and dogs at twice the dose required to
maximally inhibit alk [29].
concurrent to and following on the development of  xxxd1761xxx , other highly selective and potent alk inhibitors with
preclinical activity are currently in clinical development for
alk-positive nsclc [31].
7.

 xxxd1761xxx  has almost equivalent ic50 values against both
c-met and the npm-alk fusion gene present in alkpositive lymphoma cell lines -- therefore the potential of the
drug as an alk inhibitor was noted during development [24].
after a single  xxxd1761xxx  dose of 250 mg, cmax (peak plasma
concentration) was achieved at a median of 4 h, and was associated with a half-life of 42 h [26]. age, gender, race, or body
weight did not appear to affect  xxxd1761xxx  pharmacokinetics.
at the licensed dose of 250 mg bid po,  xxxd1761xxx  appeared
to reach steady state within 15 days. in this study  xxxd1761xxx 
appeared to exhibit non-linear pk with reductions noted in
cl/f with multiple dosing compared with single dosing,
this may be due to auto-inhibition of  xxxg590xxx .  xxxd1761xxx 
pk in alk-positive nsclc patients was similar to that
seen in patients with other tumor types. mean values for
 xxxd1761xxx  cmax and auc in asian patients appeared to be
greater than those seen in non-asian patients, however given
the safety and efficacy profile of the drug no dose adjustment
was suggested based on this finding [27].

preclinical studies

phase i study

an initial phase i, ii part, open-label, multicenter doseescalation study to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and
optimal dose of  xxxd1761xxx  as a single agent was conducted in
patients with advanced refractory solid tumors and presented
at the american society of clinical oncology (asco) annual
meeting in 2009 [26]. the study was conducted in the usa,
korea, and australia.
tumor types included were colorectal, pancreatic, sarcoma,
anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and nsclc. the aims of the
study were to determine the safety profile of  xxxd1761xxx , determine the recommended phase ii dose (rp2d), and determine
the pk profile after oral dosing.
the maximum tolerated dose achieved was 250 mg bid po.
on the basis of responses in two patients with alk rearrangements, an expansion cohort of nsclc patients harboring the
alk rearrangement were enrolled to receive the rp2d.
the results of the expansion cohort study were presented in
the new england journal of medicine in october 2010 [32].

eighty-two patients with alk-rearranged advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer were enrolled on the study through
february 10, 2010. patients in this cohort were required to
have alk positivity on fluorescence in situ hybridization
(fish), measurable disease, adequate organ function, and
resolution of all previous treatment-related toxicity to grade
1 or less. other requirements included ecog performance
status [33] of 0 -- 2. there was no limit to the number of prior
treatment lines.
approximately 1500 patients with nsclc were screened
for alk positivity and 82 were enrolled on study, giving an
approximate incidence of the alk rearrangement in this
cohort of 5.5%. median age of enrolled patients was 51 years
and 52% were male. fifty-six percent of patients were
caucasian and 35% asian. eighty-three percent of patients
were ecog performance score 0 or 1 and 59% of patients
had received two or more prior treatments. ninety-six percent
of patients had adenocarcinoma histology with signet ring
subtype being noted frequently. ninety-four percent of
patients were never or light smokers (£ 10 pack years).
the overall response rate for the cohort was 57% (46 partial
responses [pr] and 1 complete response [cr]). an additional
33% of patients had stable disease at 8-week assessment. at
the time of publication median follow-up was 6.4 months;
the authors estimated a probability for being progressionfree at that 6 months of 72% (95% ci, 61 -- 83%). of
note, this was not a prespecified analysis as the high rate of
response was unexpected.
an update of this study was presented in abstract form at
asco 2011. overall response rate was 61% (95% ci
52 -- 70%) with two crs and 69 prs; median progressionfree survival (pfs) for the 119 enrolled patients was
10 months (95% ci, 8 -- 15) [34]. of note patients who
responded did so quickly, with a median time to response of
8 weeks, essentially the first restaging time-point on study.
in the absence of overall survival data, an interesting retrospective companion study has recently been reported. the
investigators compared the outcomes of 82 patients enrolled
on the phase i study with 36 alk-positive and 253 alk-/
egfr mutation-nsclc controls at phase i sites who did
not receive  xxxd1761xxx  [35]. alk-positive patients who received
 xxxd1761xxx  appeared to have an improved 2-year overall
survival (os) (57% vs 36%) compared with alk-positive
controls who did not receive  xxxd1761xxx . the two groups
appeared to be well matched for important clinical characteristics. second- and third-line alk-positive patients who
received  xxxd1761xxx  had a median 2-year os of 55% versus
12% for alk-positive controls (p = 0.004).
8.

phase ii study

based upon encouraging response rates in the phase i study, a
large multicenter second- and subsequent-line study in alkpositive nsclc, profile 1005, was opened in 12 countries
in north america, asia, europe, and australia. preliminary
1198

results from this study were also presented at asco
2011 [36]. at the time of report, 136 patients were evaluable
for safety and 76 for tumor response. the patient characteristics largely corresponded with those previously reported in
alk-positive nsclc with an approximately even sex distribution, 94% adenocarcinoma histology, and 68% never
smokers. patients had to have received at least one line of
systemic therapy prior to going on study, however in fact
the study population is heavily pretreated with 93% having
received ‡ 2 previous treatments. the authors reported that
at this early assessment of the study, 83% of evaluable patients
had some tumor shrinkage with 54% having ‡ 30% target
lesion regression. another component of the profile study
looking at patient-reported outcomes (pros) indicated
that patient quality of life was maintained or improved
on treatment.
9.

phase iii studies

currently two multicenter international phase iii randomized
registration trials are ongoing in patients with alk-positive
nsclc.
profile 1007 is a second-line study comparing  xxxd1761xxx 
250 mg bid po with either docetaxel or  xxxd2868xxx  as secondline chemotherapy [37]. inclusion criteria include alk-positive
nsclc, only one prior line of treatment which must have
included a platinum agent, and ecog performance status
0 -- 2. the primary outcome measure is pfs of  xxxd1761xxx 
compared with standard second-line chemotherapy. secondary
outcomes include orr, os, and quality of life. this study has
an estimated primary completion date of june 2012 [37].
profile 1014 is a first-line study comparing  xxxd1761xxx 
with cisplatin/ xxxd2868xxx  or carboplatin/ xxxd2868xxx  in
alk-positive non-squamous nsclc [38]. the primary outcome measure is pfs of  xxxd1761xxx  compared with standard
of care cisplatin or carboplatin/ xxxd2868xxx . this study has
an estimated primary completion date of october 2013 [38].
10.

new directions

 xxxd1761xxx  was initially explored preclinically as a lead candidate inhibitor of c-met. clinical interest in this agent as a
met inhibitor is now reemerging with recent observations
in lung cancer and other solid tumors. met gene amplification occurs de novo in lung cancer, and has been defined as
a mechanism of acquired resistance to egfr tki therapy
in egfr-mutant nsclc.  xxxd1761xxx  shows remarkable
activity against met-amplified human nsclc xenografts [39]. a rapid and durable response to  xxxd1761xxx  was
recently reported in a patient with a de novo met amplification, serving as important proof of principle for clinical
translation [40]. this report, together with recently reported
clinical activity of  xxxd1761xxx  in met-amplified esophageal
and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma [41] has raised interest
in this target.

expert opin. pharmacother. (2012) 13(8)

 xxxd1761xxx  ( xxxd1761xxx )

beyond met, very recent data have demonstrated translocation and mutation of the related  xxxg1973xxx  receptor tyrosine
kinase in nsclc, as well as a near complete response to
 xxxd1761xxx  in a patient with a  xxxg1973xxx -translocated nsclc [42].
these new data suggest that the story observed in alktranslocated lung cancer treated with  xxxd1761xxx  may play out
again in met-amplified and  xxxg1973xxx -translocated nsclc.
pfizer is sponsoring a phase ii study to evaluate the activity
of  xxxd1761xxx  in both of these contexts.

safety and tolerability

in general  xxxd1761xxx  appears to be well tolerated by the majority of patients with the most common toxicities being
grade 2 or less, primarily gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea) and visual (delayed light adaptation).
dose-limiting toxicities of  xxxd1761xxx  in the initial phase i
study included a grade 3 increase in  xxxg941xxx 
(alt) in one patient on 200 mg qd po and grade 3 fatigue
in two patients on 300 mg bid po. the most common
adverse events noted were nausea, emesis, fatigue, and
diarrhea. grade 1 visual disturbance, mainly delayed light
adaptation, was noted in 22% of patients. peripheral neuropathy, mainly grade 1, was reported in 13% of patients. the
maximum tolerated dose (mtd) in the study was  xxxd1761xxx 
250 mg bid po [26].
in the expansion cohort of alk-positive nsclc, toxicity
in general was mild with notable grade 3 and 4 toxicities being
reversible hepatic transaminitis in 6% of patients. common
(> 20%) grade 1 toxicities were predominantly gastrointestinal with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. of note grade
1 visual disturbance was noted in 41% of patients, again
predominantly delayed visual adaptation when moving from
dark to light conditions [32].
in the phase ii, profile 1005 study, the previously noted
grade 1 and 2 gastrointestinal and visual toxicities were again
reported [36]. of note in this abstract, grade 3/4 toxicities,
including elevated  xxxg941xxx , neutropenia and
dyspnea were reported in 15% of patients perhaps reflecting
heavy pretreatment and tumor burden. two treatmentrelated deaths were reported on study, one of unknown cause
and another due to pneumonitis. of note pneumonitis
has been reported with several  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, in
particular egfr-tkis [43].
other toxicities included in the product insert for  xxxd1761xxx  approved by the fda include development of complex
renal cysts reported in two patients and qt interval
prolongation [44].
12.

regulatory affairs

 xxxd1761xxx  was granted accelerated approval for the first- or
subsequent-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic
alk-positive nsclc by the fda in the united states in
august 2011 [44]. included in the approval was a requirement

that alk testing be performed using a fda-approved test.
concurrently with fda approval of  xxxd1761xxx , the vysis
alk break-apart fish probe kit (abbott molecular) was
approved for the detection of alk translocation-positive
nsclc. accelerated approval was based on the response
rate and duration of response of the drug and the anticipated
clinical benefit, as final progression and overall survival data
is pending. final fda approval will be contingent on analysis
of these outcome measures in the ongoing phase iii studies.
 xxxd1761xxx  is under regulatory review by other authorities
including the european medicines agency with regulatory
decisions expected in 2012.
13.

conclusion

the identification of the alk fusion oncogene is an important advance in the molecular profiling of lung cancer.
many years of cytotoxic drug development for nsclc have
lead to moderate survival benefit with often significant toxicity. allied to the discovery of egfr mutations which sensitize to the egfr-tkis,  xxxd2029xxx  and gefitinib, the efficacy
and toxicity profile of  xxxd1761xxx  suggests that progress is being
made in improving outcomes and reducing toxicity of therapy
for advanced nsclc. taken together, these drugs may have
a role in the treatment of 15 -- 20% of patients with advanced
lung adenocarcinoma.
significant challenges remain. while both egfr-tkis and
 xxxd1761xxx  can deliver prolonged freedom from lung cancer
progression with modest toxicity, they do not appear to cure
advanced nsclc even in patients with driver mutations
such as activated egfr or alk rearrangements. mutations
leading to resistance to  xxxd1761xxx  have recently been
described [45] as have egfr-tki resistance mutations [46].
elucidation of resistance pathways and development of new
agents targeting other tumor growth and proliferation gene
mutations such as kras is an important goal.
 xxxd1761xxx  is a breakthrough in the management of
nsclc lung cancer providing a successful targeted-therapy
paradigm for drug development which can be built upon in
the future.
14.

expert opinion

anticancer drug development is increasingly turning toward
selectively targeted inhibitors of key oncogenic drivers.
nowhere has this focus been more evident than in lung
cancer. increasingly, lung cancers are being genetically
profiled at diagnosis. lung cancer patients defined by
tumor-specific driver mutations are being directed, in the
cases of egfr mutation and alk translocation, to therapy
with  xxxd2029xxx  and  xxxd1761xxx , respectively, and in the cases
of other known or suspected driver mutations, into clinical
trials testing targeted inhibitors of those mutant oncoproteins.
while leading cytotoxic combination therapy yields response
rates of 20 -- 30% in advanced nsclc, targeted therapies

in patients with tumor-specific driver mutations conferring
sensitivity to those agents have response rates in excess of
50%. these recent successes have re-energized the field of
lung cancer therapeutic development.
a major caveat to these success stories is that the responses
achieved are of limited durability. median progression-free
survival for patients with alk-translocated nsclc treated
with  xxxd1761xxx  is approximately 10 months, and a dependable
estimate of overall survival is not yet available. nonetheless,
just like egfr-mutant nsclc treated with an egfr tki,
it is clear that alk-rearranged tumors treated with  xxxd1761xxx 
are developing secondary resistance to drug, typically in the
first year of treatment. strategies to treat or prevent the
emergence of secondary resistance need to continue to be a
major focus of ongoing research in the field.
promising preclinical data and initial case reports suggest
that  xxxd1761xxx  may also have efficacy in the treatment of

met-amplified and  xxxg1973xxx -rearranged tumors. results of
clinical trials focused on these tumor subsets are eagerly
awaited.
 xxxd1761xxx  represents a major advance in the treatment in a
subset of lung cancer patients. unlike traditional anticancer
drug discovery efforts, focused on finding agents with
activity in the greatest number of patients,  xxxd1761xxx  represents a different strategy, focused on finding agents with
the greatest activity in a small subset of patients, defined by
a molecular alteration conferring sensitivity to the drug.
we look forward to many more advances based on this
therapeutic strategy.
