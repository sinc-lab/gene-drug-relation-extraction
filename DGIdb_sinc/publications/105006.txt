the exact mechanism of active calcium transport remains to
be resolved, we have recently identified
a calcium-binding
protein (cabp) (2) and a carbonic anhydrase activity (3), both
of which appear to be functionally
involved in the developmentally expressed calcium transport process of the cam.’
the cabp has been purified to homogeneity
by a procedure
involving salt fractionation,
gel filtration,
and isoelectric focusing (4). subsequent characterization
of the purified cabp
showed that it is a high-molecular-weight
(mr = 100,000) and
basic (p1 = 8.06) protein possessing specific, high affinity
calcium-binding
sites (4). moreover, our studies revealed that
the cabp of the cam contains several residues of a modified
amino acid, y-carboxyglutamic
acid (y-cglu) (4).
y-carboxyglutamic
acid residues were first identified a few
years ago in several liver-derived
coagulation proteins, including prothrombin
(5), and a low molecular weight protein from
bone (6,7). the formation of y-cglu in prothrombin
has since
been shown to be mediated by a post-translational,
vitamin
k-dependent
carboxylation
reaction localized in liver microsomes (8, 9). a similar reaction has also been recently shown
in kidney microsomes (10). in view of these findings and the
presence of y-cglu in the cam cabp, it appears likely that
similar  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
mechanisms may be operative
in the formation of y-cglu residues in the cabp and, moreover, may be functionally
required
in the activation
and
expression of the cabp in the cam during embryonic development.
consistent with this hypothesis is our recent finding that
the expression of cabp in cam organ cultures is induced in
the presence of exogenous  xxxd3522xxx  (11).
we demonstrate
here that the developmental
expression of
cabp in the cam in uivo is  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
and that a
microsomal,
post-translational,
and  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
yglutamyl carboxylase activity is present in the cam.

during
embryonic
development
of the chick, the onset of calcium
transport
by the chorioallantoic
membrane (cam) is concomitant
with the appearance
of a
calcium-binding
protein
(cabp). the development-specific expression
of the cabp in the cam is inhibited
by
vitamin
k antagonism
in ouo with the anticoagulant,
warfarin.
however,
the cabp remains immunologically
detectable
in the cam of warfarin-treated
embryos,
suggesting
the presence
of a precursor
form of the
cabp. previously,
we have demonstrated
that cabp
expression
in cam organ cultures
is inducible
by  xxxd3522xxx . furthermore,
the cabp contains
several residues of the modified
amino acid, y-carboxyglutamic
acid (y-cglu),
which
has been shown to be formed
by
vitamin
k-dependent
carboxylation
of glutamic
acid in
several plasma clotting
proteins.
this study reports the
presence
of a post-translational,
vitamin
k-dependent
y-glutamyl
carboxylase
activity in the cam.
our results
show that explants
of cam incorporate
h14c03 in an age-specific
and vitamin
k-dependent
manner.
incorporation
of h14c03 by the cam is further
potentiated
by warfarin
treatment
of the embryos,
presumably
owing to an elevation
of the amount
of endogenous uncarboxylated
protein
precursor(s).
among the
subcellular
(nuclear,
mitochondrial,
microsomal,
and
soluble)
fractions
of the cam, only microsomes
exhibit
specific incorporation
of h14c03 into y-cglu. the cam
microsomal
carboxylation
activity
is post-translational,
vitamin
k-dependent,
specific
for prenylated
homologs
of vitamin
k, sensitive
to warfarin,
and appears to be unrelated
to the activities
of biotin-dependent carboxylases
or phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase. optimal

(v/w)
of

several specific nh*-terminal

appeared likely that a similar uncarboxylated
precursor of the
cabp was expressed in the cam during  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency
in the embryo. in view of this possible analogy with the
prothrombin
system (13, 27), we employed both normal and
warfarin-treated
chick embryos to study the mechanism of
action of  xxxd3522xxx  in y-glutamyl carboxylation
and on the

fig. 1. effect of in. uivo administration of  xxxd3522xxx  and warfarin
on the developmental expression of calcium-binding activity in the
cam. the cam was dissected out from the embryos at the indicated
ages and extracts were prepared as described previously (2). calciumbinding activities in the cam extracts were determined by the chelex
100 method (2). the embryos used included: w,
control embryos; m,
embryos injected with 200 pg of vitamin ks/embryo
on incubation day 10; and n-----n,
embryos
injected
with sodium
warfarin according to the following regimen per embryo: 100 pg/day
on incubation days 11,12,13, and 14; and 200 pg/day on days 15,16,
and 17. all injections were 50 ~1 each and carried out as described
under “materials and methods.”
alone, daily administration
of warfarin to the embryo significantly inhibited
the developmental
expression of calciumbinding activity in the cam. in addition, determinations
of
plasma prothrombin
times revealed that the prothrombin
titers of warfarin-treated
17-day-old embryos were only 15 to
20% of control values, indicating a severe deficiency of vitamin
k in these embryos. these results strongly suggest a vitamin
k requirement
for the developmentally
dependent expression
of calcium-binding
activity in the cam in uivo.
we next investigated whether the warfarin-mediated
reduction of calcium-binding
activity in the cam was due to a
lowered level of the cabp, which constitutes over 95% of the
calcium-binding
activity in the cam (2). extracts of cam
from normal and warfarin-treated
embryos were tested by
ouchterlony
double immunodiffusion
against a specific anticabp antiserum
(20). the result in fig. 2 revealed that
immunoreactive
cabp was present in both the normal and
warfarin-treated
cam extracts. this observation
suggests
that an antigenically
similar but biochemically
inactive molecular species of cabp, perhaps in the form of a precursor,
was produced in the cam as a result of warfarin-mediated
 xxxd3522xxx  deficiency in vivo.
these findings on the mode of expression of the cabp in
viva, taken together, strongly resemble those obtained for the
coagulation
factor, prothrombin,
in the liver during perturbation of the physiological
level of  xxxd3522xxx  (5). under
 xxxd3522xxx -deficient
conditions, an “abnormal
prothrombin”
(5) is produced in the liver. the coagulation-incompetent
“abnormal

is identical to prothrombin

3) to reduce the non-biotindependent,

identified (fig. 3c).
using this incubation
procedure, we measured the vitamin
k-dependent
incorporation
of h14c03 into cam explants
taken from normal embryos at developmental
stages before
the expression of the cabp (incubation
day 11) and after its
expression (day 18) (2), and also from warfarin-treated
18day-old embryos. the results presented in table i show that:
1) cam explants of both ll- and n-day-old
(normal and
warfarin-treated)
embryos incorporated
more h14coa in the
presence of exogenous vitamin
k; 2) the relative specific
activities of the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
incorporation
of h’?03
(in counts per min per mg of protein) by cam explants were
in the order, warfarin-treated
n-day-old
embryo > normal
18-day-old embryo > 11-day-old embryo; and 3) the ratios of
h14c03 incorporation
by cam explants in the presence of
 xxxd3522xxx  in the medium to that in its absence were 1.2, 14.2,

in chorioallantoic

membrane

and 36.2 for the 11-day-old, normal 18-day-old, and warfarintreated 18-day-old embryos, respectively. thus, it is apparent
that the capacity of the cam explants to incorporate
h14c03
was  xxxd3522xxx -dependent,
higher in the older (18-day-old)
than in the younger (11-day-old) embryos, and potentiated by
warfarin treatment of the embryo. amino acid analysis (fig.
30) further substantiated
these indications with the identification of [‘4c]y-cglu
in the alkaline hydrolysate
of h14c03labeled cam explant from warfarin-treated
18-day-old embryo in which 80% of the radioactivity
was accounted for by
[*4c]y-cglu.
further analysis showed that  xxxd3522xxx  promoted the h’4c0jabeling
of y-cglu and that the level of
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent
formation of [‘4c]y-cglu was substantially elevated when the embryo was treated with warfarin.
these results are expressed quantitatively
in table i as percentages of total radioactivity
in the [‘4c]y-cglu peak.

as a comparison, we also measured the incorporation
of
h14c03 into liver slices of these embryos by the same incu-.
bation method (see procedure for cam explants under “materials and methods”).
the results (table i) for the liver,
which contains  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
y-glutamyl carboxylase
activity (8,9), were remarkably parallel to those obtained with
the cam explants of the same embryos. amino acid analysis
also identified [‘4c]y-cglu
in the h14c03-labeled
liver slices
(fig. 3e). however, for both the normal and warfarin-treated
l&day-old
embryos, the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
incorporation
of h14c03 was 5- to ‘i-fold higher in the liver compared with
the cam.
overall, these results clearly indicate the presence of a
developmentally
expressed and  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
y-glutamyl carboxylase system in the cam. also, warfarin treatment of the embryos potentiated
the carboxylation
system in
the cam as well as the liver, probably by the endogenous
accumulation
of uncarboxylated
precursor substrate(s) as a
result of  xxxd3522xxx  antagonism.

 xxxd3522xxx -dependent incorporation of h’4c03 into cam
subcellular fractions
since the main objective in this study was to qualitatively
localize the subcellular
site of the y-glutamyl
carboxylase
activity in the cam, the fractionation
procedure used was a
relatively simple one employing only differential
centrifugation (2). the distribution
of enzyme markers in fig. 4 showed
that the fractionation
procedure
yielded substantially
enriched nuclear, mitochondrial,
microsomal, and soluble fractions of the cam. electron microscopy of the microsomal
fraction (fig. 5), which exhibited y-glutamyl carboxylase activity (see below), showed that membranous
vesicles were
predominant.
these were coated with ribosomes and presumably derived from the endoplasmic
reticulum.
nuclear and
mitochondrial
structures were virtually absent.
the subcellular location of the cam y-glutamyl carboxylase activity was ascertained by testing the nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble fractions of the cam for incorporation of h’*c03 into y-cglu as described under “materials
and methods.”
the results in fig. 3, f to i show that h14c03 was incorporated into the nuclear, mitochondrial,
and microsomal fractions but not into the soluble fraction of the cam. after
alkaline hydrolysis, the nuclear (fig. 3f) and mitochondrial
(fig. 3g) fractions were shown to contain ‘%-labeled
components which eluted differently from standard [‘4c]y-cglu and
consisted largely of labeled glu, asp, and pro. only the
microsomal
fraction (fig. 31) of the cam exhibited specific
labeling of y-cglu, indicating
the presence of a y-glutamyl
carboxylase activity. for comparison, we also measured the

property as synthetic y-cglu. the analyzer chromatogram
of
labeled microsomes shown in fig. 31 demonstrated
that more
than 90% of the radioactivity
resided in an acidic component
which co-eluted with authentic [‘4c]y-cglu (fig. 3, a and b).
2) due to the acid lability of y-cglu which yields glu by
decarboxylation
(e), labeled cam microsomes hydrolyzed in
6 n hcl should show loss of [‘4c]y-cglu and the concomitant
appearance of [14c]glu. as shown in fig. 3j, the acid-hydrolyzed cam microsomes revealed a total conversion of [‘“c]ycglu to [‘4c]glu. 3) since random loss of one of the two ycarboxyl groups of y-cglu takes place during decarboxylation
in hot acid (16), [‘4c]y-cglu
derived from the post-translational h’4c03-carboxylation
of glu should lose 50% of its
radioactivity
under these conditions
(30). this was found to
be the case for the h14c03-labeled
microsomes of the cam
(table ii). these results taken toeether indicate that cam
microsomes were capable of exclusive y-glutamyl carboxylation to give rise to y-cglu residues.

more active
than the unprenylated

( xxxd2563xxx  and ks).
moreover,

further evidence for the  xxxd3522xxx  dependence of the cam

the soluble fraction was
lyophilized

based on four experiments, no difference in radioactivity
was
observed between the samples that were incubated with the
soluble peptide and control samples. moreover,
upon gel
filtration on a bio-gel p-2 column, no radioactive component
co-eluted with the peptide. it therefore appeared unlikely that
the prothrombin
subpeptide
was carboxylated
by cam microsomes.
post-translational
carboxylation-the
post-translational
nature of y-glutamyl carboxylation
by the cam microsomes
was suggested from the following experimental
conditions: 1)
the translation
of soluble messages should be minimal since
only microsomes were used in the carboxylation
reaction; and,
furthermore,
2) the initiation
of polypeptide formation should
be inhibited since the microsomal carboxylation
reaction was
carried out in the presence of 1 mg/ml of the protein synthesis
inhibitor,
cycloheximide.
indeed, using [3h]leu as a marker
in initial experiments,
the level of de nouo protein synthesis
(incorporation
of r3h]leu in trichloroacetic
acid-precipitable
fraction) was undetectable.
other requirements-the
following substances were tested
in the microsomal
carboxylation
system to investigate other
possible requirements
or mechanisms
of the reaction:
1)
acetazolamide,
to inhibit the conversion of hc03- to coz by
carbonic anhydrase (31); 2) desthiobiotin
or avidin, to inhibit
the biotin-dependent
carboxylation
reactions; and 3) 3-mercaptopicolinic
acid, to inhibit the non-biotin-dependent
carboxylation
reaction by phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase
(28, 29). as shown in table iii, acetazolamide
significantly
inhibited the microsomal carboxylation
reaction, whereas desthiobiotin,
avidin, and 3-mercaptopicolinic
acid were ineffective. these results therefore indicate that the cam microsomal carboxylation
reaction was specific for  xxxd3522xxx  and
at least partially dependent on the level of free coz.

cam ectoderm occurs concomitantly
with the onset of calcium transport by the cam (44). based on these observations,
we have suggested that  xxxd3522xxx  may be functional in the
developing
chick embryo to regulate
calcium metabolism
through the cam calcium transport process (11). the results
reported here are thus consistent with this general hypothesis.
furthermore,
it appears that the availability
of  xxxd3522xxx  and
the state of differentiation
of the cam ectoderm are both
necessary and are intricately
co-ordinated
in vivo
for the
expression of the cabp. the egg yolk is a rich, natural
reservoir of  xxxd3522xxx , containing
40 to 50 pg of the vitamin
(45). it is conceivable that as a result of the increased vascularization
of the cam during embryonic
development
(44)
 xxxd3522xxx  is gradually released from the yolk to the cam to
regulate the characteristic
age-dependent
expression of the
cabp in the cam. a hypothetical
sequence of events leading
to the expression of the cabp in the cam may be as follows:
release of  xxxd3522xxx  to the cam ectoderm through increased
vascularization;
possible  xxxd3522xxx -mediated
induction of cellular differentiation
in the cam ectoderm; production
of
mrna of cabp by specific, differentiated
cells; and translation of the mrna of cabp followed by  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
carboxylation
resulting
in the expression of active cabp.
further investigations
are obviously needed to elucidate the
precise cellular and molecular
mechanisms
underlying
the
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent
expression of the cabp in the cam.
finally, although we have demonstrated
the biosynthesis of
y-cglu in the cam, it remains to be established whether the
cabp is the only carboxylated protein species in the cam. in
comparison,
a family of  xxxd3522xxx -dependent,
y-cglu-containing plasma proteins is synthesized in the liver (11).

the discovery a few years ago of the modified amino acid
residue, y-cglu, in several  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
proteins,
such as prothrombin
(32), has generated much current interest
in the study of the molecular mechanism of the physiological
action of  xxxd3522xxx . in the liver,  xxxd3522xxx  has been clearly
shown to participate
in the post-translational,
and carboxylase-catalyzed formation of y-cglu by microsomes (14,27,30).
the requirements
for this reaction include at least the following: 1)  xxxd3522xxx , in its reduced form (14, 27); 2) co? (not
bicarbonate)
(33); 3) molecular oxygen (34); and 4) substrate,
in the form of either the endogenous uncarboxylated
precursor
protein (30) or synthetic peptides corresponding
to specific
sequences of the precursor protein (35,36). during y-glutamyl
carboxylation,
 xxxd3522xxx  is oxidized and is later regenerated
by the action of a microsomal
epoxidase system (9). anticoagulants, such as the coumarins and indandiones,
inhibit the
biosynthesis
of y-cglu by blocking the regeneration
of the
reduced form of  xxxd3522xxx  (37).
the findings reported here show that similar requirements
also apply for the y-glutamyl carboxylase system of the cam:
dependence on  xxxd3522xxx  (14, 27), inhibition
by warfarin (14,
38), and insensitivity
to known inhibitors
of biotin-mediated
carboxylation
reactions (39, 40). in addition, both systems
appear to be selective for prenylated homologs of  xxxd3522xxx 
(14, 34). this is consistent with the findings that naphthoquinones such as  xxxd2563xxx  are readily prenylated or alkylated
in vivo (41-43), probably an important
step for their subsequent biological activity.
on the other hand, the liver and cam microsomal carboxylases also differ in several aspects. first, the specific activity
of the carboxylation
reaction, measured by the amount of
h%03 incorporated
per mg of protein, is considerably higher
in the liver than in the cam microsomes. second, the cam
carboxylation
system is inactive on the soluble prothrombin
subpeptide, phe-leu-glu-glu-val,
which is effectively carboxylated in a  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
manner by liver microsomes
(35, 36). third, the reaction kinetics of the liver and cam
carboxylation
systems differ significantly.
in the former, maximal activity is reached after incubation
at 37°c for 10 min
(27, 28), whereas 50 to 60 min is required for the latter (fig.
7). the interpretation
of these differences is, however, difficult
due to the heterogeneity
of the microsomal enzyme preparations. furthermore,
chick embryos are used in the present
study in contrast to the many rodent experimental
models
used in the liver studies, which may account for some of the
differences observed here. to elucidate the substrate sequence
specificity of the cam carboxylase, methods to solubilize and
further enrich the enzyme preparation
are currently
being
investigated.
overall, the findings reported
here strongly suggest the
presence of a unique  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
carboxylase activity in the placenta-like
cam of the developing chick embryo.
we have previously
reported
that the y-cglu-containing
cabp may play an important
role in the calcium transport
function by virtue of its developmental
expression (2) and
cellular location (20) in the cam. furthermore,
the expression
of the cabp is induced by  xxxd3522xxx  in organ cultures of
cam explanted from 13- to 15-day-old embryos (11). prior to
culture, the cam explants contain low levels of calciumbinding activity and cabp is undetectable
immunologically
(2,11,20). after 3 days of culture in the presence of exogenous
 xxxd3522xxx , the level of calcium-binding
activity increases 7to &fold and immunoreactive
cabp is detected (11). concomitantly, the cam ectoderm undergoes morphological
changes
and gradually becomes a highly stratified epithelium
