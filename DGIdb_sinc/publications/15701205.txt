summary

this is a review of the uses of  xxxd2474xxx  in
psychiatry, based upon medline, psyclit and
embase literature searches.
the main indications for this drug in psychiatry
are schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
 xxxd2474xxx ’s sedative properties particularly
fit it to use in psychiatric intensive care. there is
also some evidence to suggest it has efficacy in
drug-resistant psychosis, although this property of

introduction
in canada, uk and most other european countries,
 xxxd2474xxx  (or  xxxd2474xxx ) is marketed
as  xxxd2474xxx * (and in the us as  xxxd2474xxx ) and is
available orally as  xxxd2474xxx  maleate 25 mg or as
an intramuscular (im) injection  xxxd2474xxx 
hydrochloride (a 2.5% isotonic solution in ampoules).
the oral form of the drug is licensed for use in the uk
for psychotic disorders, the intramuscular form is not.
the intramuscular preparation is sometimes useful for
rapid tranquillisation in severely disturbed patients with
schizophrenia. since the bioavailability of an
intramuscular dose is higher than the bioavailability of
an oral dose any initial im dose should be in the order of
12.5 mg with a maximum im dose of 50 mg.
 xxxd2474xxx  was originally marketed by rhônepoulenc rorer (aventis) as an antipsychotic.

the drug does require further research.
in other areas of medicine  xxxd2474xxx 
has been used in: alleviating bronchoconstriction;
as a preoperative sedative; in terminal pain control
and postoperative analgesia; and in the control of
nausea. some antimycobacterial properties have
been recorded.
the drug should not be prescribed to patients at
high risk of accidental or suicidal overdose.

in psychiatry  xxxd2474xxx  is used as a sedative
and in the management of schizophrenia.
 xxxd2474xxx  has been used in a variety of clinical
areas – alleviating bronchoconstriction1, as a
preoperative sedative2, in terminal pain control and
postoperative analgesia3,4 and in the control of nausea5.
similar to some other phenothiazines,  xxxd2474xxx 
even has some antimycobacterial properties6.
this review considers the use of  xxxd2474xxx  in
psychiatry and is based on literature searches using
medline, embase and psyclit.

molecular formula c19h25n2os.  xxxd2474xxx ,
therefore, belongs to the phenothiazine group of drugs,
like chlorpromazine. phenothiazines have a three-ring
structure in which two benzene rings are linked by a
sulphur and nitrogen atom.  xxxd2474xxx ’s
chemical structure is (–)(dimethylamino-3 methyl-2
propyl)-10 methoxy-2 phenothiazine (figure 1).

pharmacokinetics and
metabolism
therapeutic levels of  xxxd2474xxx  are achieved at
serum concentrations between 0.02 mg/l and
0.14 mg/l7.
orally administered  xxxd2474xxx  is subject to a
first pass metabolism such that only 50% of the orally
administered drug reaches the general circulation8.
plasma concentrations of  xxxd2474xxx  reach their
maximum levels 30 min–90 min after intramuscular
injection, and 1 h–3 h after oral administration. the
half-life of  xxxd2474xxx  is 15 h–30 h.
 xxxd2474xxx  has two major metabolites in man:
the pharmacologically active n-monodesmethyl
 xxxd2474xxx , which is almost as potent an
antipsychotic as the parent drug; and  xxxd2474xxx 
sulphoxide, which is much less active. the metabolism
is predominantly hepatic.
in different patients the half-life has been found to
vary from 16.5 h to 77.8 h9. the individual variability in
metabolising the drug may account for the variation in
the therapeutic dose required in different individuals.

pharmacology
the therapeutic actions of  xxxd2474xxx  in
schizophrenia and as an antipsychotic in general are
largely ascribed to its dopamine blocking ability.
however, it has been mooted that the drug may have
some additional tendency to be useful in treatmentresistant schizophrenia and this has been linked to its
receptor binding profile, which has been compared and
contrasted to clozapine and chlorpromazine by lal et
al.10. in their study of the binding profile of
 xxxd2474xxx  in the human brain they found that
 xxxd2474xxx  showed significantly greater binding
affinity for both alpha-1 and serotonin-2 binding sites
than clozapine or chlorpromazine, which they thought
significant.  xxxd2474xxx  has significantly greater
binding to alpha-2 sites than chlorpromazine. the exact
reasons why clozapine has a unique efficacy are perhaps
more complex, however.
1878 focus on  xxxd2474xxx 

early on in the literature,  xxxd2474xxx  was
referred to as an antidepressant neuroleptic. it seems to
have acquired the term, antidepressant neuroleptic,
because it is a potent serotonin 5-ht2 and alpha 1adrenergic blocking agent and because it was noted that
chronic administration affected the serotonin system in
a manner similar to that produced by prolonged
administration of antidepressants11. there is no
substantial evidence to back the historical claims of
antidepressant activity, and further research would be
necessary in this regard.
the two major metabolites are n-monodesmethyl
 xxxd2474xxx  and  xxxd2474xxx  sulphoxide. nmonodesmethyl  xxxd2474xxx  may contribute to
the antipsychotic effects of  xxxd2474xxx , but the
sulphoxide metabolite lacks neuroleptic potency12 . both
metabolites contribute to the autonomic side effects of
the drug. n-monodesmethyl  xxxd2474xxx  has a
slightly higher potency than chlorpromazine on
alpha-adrenergic binding, and a somewhat lower
potency than chlorpromazine on dopamine receptor
binding.  xxxd2474xxx  sulphoxide was relatively
inactive in terms of dopamine receptor binding but
seems much more active in the alpha-adrenergic
receptor binding with a binding affinity similar to
7-hydroxy chlorpromazine.

indications
the main indications in psychiatry are schizophrenia and
schizoaffective disorder. its sedative properties
particularly fit it to use in psychiatric intensive care.

efficacy
the relatively elderly nature of the compound
means that recent drug trials often see the drug
used as a standard comparator for novel agents. the
wealth of research data now used to launch novel drugs
is just not apparent with  xxxd2474xxx . an

example of a trial in recent years employing
 xxxd2474xxx  as comparator is one where
risperidone was compared with haloperidol and
 xxxd2474xxx  in 62 patients with schizophrenia
randomised to receive one of the three antipsychotic
drugs13.
risperidone and haloperidol appeared to produce a
20% reduction in panss symptoms in a higher
frequency of patients than with levomepromazine13. the
20% reduction in panss symptoms occurred with 81%
of the risperidone patients, 60% of the haloperidol
patients, and 52% of the  xxxd2474xxx  patients. in
terms of the psychotic anxiety scale, improvements
were significantly greater in the risperidone patients
than the  xxxd2474xxx  patients; but the difference
between haloperidol and  xxxd2474xxx  was not
significant. extrapyramidal side effects were more
severe in the haloperidol group than with
 xxxd2474xxx  or risperidone, but there was little
difference between risperidone and  xxxd2474xxx 
treated patients.
the binding profile of  xxxd2474xxx  has led to
speculation about its potential usefulness in treatmentresistant schizophrenia11. there is some tentative clinical
evidence that there may indeed be some potential in
using  xxxd2474xxx  in treatment resistant
schizophrenia. lal and nair found improvement in 16 of
23 chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients
who were treated with levomepromazine14. they had
previously been hospitalised, in most cases for at least
2 years and had problems with positive symptoms,
irritability, restlessness, hostility, uncooperativeness,
poor concentration and aggressive behaviour. discharge
to less restrictive environments was possible in seven,
placement on a waiting list for a foster home in four and
improved behaviour and autonomy in five patients.
there were, however, untoward adverse effects in a high
proportion – five subjects developed seizures and one
agranulocytosis.
a norwegian study of elderly residents of nursing
homes in 1992 found that  xxxd2474xxx  with
haloperidol was as effective as  xxxd3568xxx  in
managing elderly patients with symptoms of agitation
and hostility/aggressiveness15.
its use for agitation associated with acquired brain
injury was described in a retrospective chart review of
over 100 patients discharged from an acquired brain
injury unit over a course of 2 years16.

acute dystonias (spasms of eye, face, neck and back
muscles), akathisia (motor restlessness), parkinsonismlike syndrome (rigidity and tremor) can all occur.
 xxxd2474xxx ’s potential to cause extrapyramidal
side effects is less than haloperidol and similar to
risperidone13.  xxxd2474xxx  is linked with tardive
dyskinesia.
other noted side effects include cholinergically
mediated ones such as dry mouth, nasal stuffiness,
difficulty in micturition, constipation and blurring of
vision.
other adverse effects include tachycardia,
hypotension, weight gain, impotence, galactorrhoea,
hypothermia (a problem in the elderly), gynaecomastia,
amenorrhoea, benign obstructive jaundice and
dermatitis, ecg irregularities, drowsiness, lethargy,
fatigue, epileptiform seizures.
blood dyscrasias such as agranulocytosis and
pancytopenia have been recognized as adverse effects
for some time14,17,18.

neuroleptic malignant syndrome (nms) has been
linked to  xxxd2474xxx  used with olanzapine in one
patient in a recent report19.
phototoxicity is a noted problem with phenothiazines.
 xxxd2474xxx  may have a reduced propensity to
cause this problem compared to chlorpromazine20.
fatal overdoses with  xxxd2474xxx  are rare, but
have been reported7. in the latter case report the blood
drug concentration recorded was 4.1 mg/l, (whereas
therapeutic levels are 0.02 mg/l–0.14 mg/l).
the relative toxicities of different neuroleptics have
been compared using f-values. the f-value is calculated
by dividing the number of deaths caused by a specific
neuroleptic into the number of defined daily doses
prescribed in the observation period. the highest fvalues for neuroleptics have been linked with lowpotency, such as prothipendyl,  xxxd1679xxx  and
levomepromazine21. the schreinzer et al. study
incorporated 85 fatal intoxications with neuroleptics in
vienna from 1991 to 199721. the authors concluded
that careless use of low-potency neuroleptics should be
avoided in patients with a potential risk of accidental or
suicidal overdose. a finnish study by koski et al. looked
at the interaction of alcohol and drugs in fatal
poisonings. the study sounded a note of caution finding
that some drugs seemed to be especially problematic in
overdose with alcohol. they also found a relatively high
fatal toxicity index (fti) for  xxxd2474xxx  (fti =
47.3), similar to propoxyphene (fti = 32.0) and
amitriptyline (fti = 12.2), but not as severe as
 xxxd3024xxx  (fti = 120.8)22.
since  xxxd2474xxx  has been noted to have
analgesic properties a propensity for abuse could be
predicted to be a potential problem.  xxxd2474xxx ’s
analgesic effects have been studied in comparison to
morphine.  xxxd2474xxx  does not compete with
naloxone for binding sites in the brain and its analgesic
effects are not antagonized by naloxone. unlike
morphine, tolerance does not develop to the analgesic
effect of  xxxd2474xxx , in the short term anyway.

interactions
out of all the phenothiazines,  xxxd2474xxx  exerts
the most potent effects on cytochrome p-450 activity
(as measured by caffeine oxidation in rat liver
microsomes)23.
 xxxd2474xxx  inhibits cyp1a2, cyp3a2,
cyp2d6 and other cyp isoenzymes. this would have
implications for the metabolism of other drugs, which
are metabolised by these isoenzymes, if co administered
with  xxxd2474xxx .

1880 focus on  xxxd2474xxx 

 xxxd2474xxx  may interact with citalopram
causing a 10%–20% increase from the initial steadystate levels of the primary citalopram metabolite,
desmethylcitalopram24.

cautions and
contraindications
contraindications include comatose states and bone
marrow depression (except where  xxxd2474xxx  is
used in terminal care).
cautions include cardiovascular disease, hepatic
impairment, parkinsonism, epilepsy, pregnancy and
lactation.

conclusions
the main indications for use of this drug in psychiatry
are schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. the drug
appears to be effective in psychosis and there is also
some evidence to suggest it has efficacy in drug-resistant
psychosis, although this property of the drug does
require further research.  xxxd2474xxx ’s sedative
properties particularly fit it to use in psychiatric
intensive care. the drug should be avoided in patients at
high risk of accidental or suicidal overdose.
a definitive formal controlled study of  xxxd2474xxx 
in treatment-resistant schizophrenia is warranted.
