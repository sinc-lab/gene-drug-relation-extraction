lack of dietary methyl groups and/or related cofactors (e.g.,
folate) can result in neoplastic development (3– 6).
because sah is a potent inhibitor of most methyltransferases (7), the intracellular ratio of sam to sah is considered to be an important index of transmethylation potential
(1,2).  xxxg928xxx  ( xxxg928xxx ) is a key protein
in transmethylation because it is believed to function in the
regulation of the sam:sah ratio. this regulatory mechanism
also depends on 1) sam functioning as an allosteric inhibitor
of 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ) (8,9)
and 2) 5-methyl-thf serving as a ligand of  xxxg928xxx  that upon
binding inhibits its enzymatic activity (10,11). under conditions of excess methionine, the concomitant increase in sam
concentrations inhibits  xxxg1475xxx , thereby reducing the supply
of methyl groups as 5-methyl-thf. this reduction in 5methyl-thf alleviates its inhibition on  xxxg928xxx  and subsequently enables the excess methyl groups from methionine to
be disposed of as sarcosine. conversely, methionine- or methyl
group-deficient conditions favor synthesis of 5-methyl-thf
and inhibition of  xxxg928xxx , thereby conserving methyl groups
for important transmethylation reactions.
clearly, regulatory control of  xxxg928xxx  activity by 5-methylthf, as well as posttranslational modification of the protein
by phosphorylation, plays an important role in the regulation
of both folate and methyl group metabolism without altering
the abundance of the protein (10,11). factors that can perturb
these metabolic pathways and/or the communication between

methionine is an essential amino acid that is required for
protein synthesis and as a source of methyl groups for a number
of important reactions (1,2). in its active form as  xxxd3156xxx  (sam)4, methyl groups serve as a substrate in the
transmethylation of proteins, biogenic amines, nucleic acids
and phospholipids. following sam-dependent transmethylation, the product s- xxxd3157xxx  (sah) is metabolized to adenosine and homocysteine, the latter being at a
metabolic branch point to undergo either transsulfuration to
cysteine or remethylation back to methionine. for remethylation, the required methyl group is obtained from either the
folate-dependent one-carbon pool [i.e., 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-thf)] or betaine, in certain tissues. an adequate supply of methyl groups is critical for health because a

abstract  xxxg928xxx  ( xxxg928xxx ) regulates  xxxd3156xxx  (sam) levels and the ratio of
sam:s- xxxd3157xxx  (sah). in liver, methionine availability, both from the diet and via the folatedependent one-carbon pool, modulates  xxxg928xxx  activity to maintain an optimal sam:sah ratio. the regulation of
 xxxg928xxx  activity is accomplished via posttranslational and allosteric mechanisms. we more closely examined  xxxg928xxx 
regulation in various tissues as a function of excess dietary methyl groups. sprague dawley rats were fed either a
control diet (10% casein plus 0.3%  xxxd2595xxx ) or the control diet supplemented with graded levels (0.5–2%) of
 xxxd2595xxx . pair-fed control groups of rats were included due to the toxicity associated with high methionine
consumption. as expected, the hepatic activity of  xxxg928xxx  was significantly elevated in a dose-dependent fashion
after 10 d of feeding the diets containing excess methionine. moreover, the abundance of hepatic  xxxg928xxx  protein
was similarly increased. the kidney had a significant increase in  xxxg928xxx  as a function of dietary methionine, but to
a much lesser extent than in the liver. for pancreatic tissue, neither the activity of  xxxg928xxx  nor the abundance of the
protein was responsive to excess dietary methionine. these data suggest that additional mechanisms contribute
to regulation of  xxxg928xxx  such that synthesis of the protein is greater than its degradation. in addition, methionineinduced regulation of  xxxg928xxx  is dose dependent and appears to be tissue specific, the latter suggesting that the role
it plays in the kidney and pancreas may in part differ from its hepatic function. j. nutr. 132: 2545–2550, 2002.

them can have adverse consequences. we have recently demonstrated that retinoid compounds can alter the hepatic activity of  xxxg928xxx  and this regulation occurs at least in part by
increasing the abundance of  xxxg928xxx  protein (12,13). this may
be because of an increase in transcription and/or translation or
a decrease in the degradation of  xxxg928xxx  protein. in this study,
we provide direct evidence that dietary methionine supply also
regulates hepatic  xxxg928xxx  by increasing its abundance. moreover, the regulation of  xxxg928xxx  activity and protein level by
methionine is dose dependent and appears to be tissue specific.
materials and methods
all experiments involving animals were approved by and conducted in accordance to guidelines established by the iowa state
university laboratory animal resources committee. male sprague
dawley (harlan sprague dawley, indianapolis, in) rats (54 –74 g)
were housed in plastic cages in a room with a 12-h light-dark cycle.
they consumed water ad libitum. the composition of the control diet
(10% casein plus 0.3%  xxxd2595xxx ) has been previously described
(14).

experiment series 1: dose-dependent regulation of  xxxg928xxx 
by excess dietary methionine
rats were adapted to the control diet for 5 d and randomly
assigned to one of five methionine-supplemented treatment groups
(four rats per group): the control diet, the control diet plus 0.5%
 xxxd2595xxx , the control diet plus 1%  xxxd2595xxx  or the control
diet plus 2%  xxxd2595xxx . the total nonprotein free methionine
provided by each of these diets was 0.3, 0.8, 1.3 and 2.3%, respectively. group 5 was a pair-fed control group offered the mean amount
of food consumed by the 2%  xxxd2595xxx  group. rats were fed their
respective diets for a total of 10 d, after which they were killed and
livers were removed for the subsequent determination of  xxxg928xxx 
activity and  xxxg928xxx  protein abundance.

experiment series 2: tissue-specific regulation of  xxxg928xxx 
by excess dietary methionine
based on the results from experiment series 1, experiment series 2
used only 1 and 2% methionine-supplemented rats and included
pair-fed controls for both groups. after a 5-d acclimation period, two
groups consumed ad libitum either the control diet plus 1%
 xxxd2595xxx  or the control diet plus 2%  xxxd2595xxx  (1.3 and 2.3%
total nonprotein free  xxxd2595xxx , respectively). the other two
groups of rats consumed the control diet but each group was pair-fed
the mean amount consumed by the rats fed the 1 and 2% methionine-supplemented diets. after the 10-d treatment period liver,
kidney and pancreas samples were removed for the determination of
 xxxg928xxx  activity and  xxxg928xxx  protein abundance. additional liver and
kidney samples were removed for the measurement of sam and
sah.

 xxxg928xxx  analysis
for the determination of  xxxg928xxx  activity (15), tissue samples from
both experiment series 1 and 2 were homogenized in 3 volumes of
ice-cold buffer [10 mmol/l sodium phosphate (ph 7), 0.25 mol/l
sucrose, 1 mmol/l edta, 1 mmol/l sodium azide, 1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride] and centrifuged at 20,000 ⫻ g for 30 min.
 xxxd26xxx  was added to an aliquot of the resulting supernatant to a final concentration of 10 mmol/l. total soluble protein
concentration of the supernatant was determined by the method of
bradford (16) using a commercially available kit (coomassie plus;
pierce, rockford, il) and bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) as a standard.
 xxxg928xxx  activity assays were initiated by the addition of 250 ␮g
protein to a reaction mixture containing 200 mmol/l tris (ph 9), 5

metabolite analysis
liver and kidney samples from experiment series 2 were homogenized in 4 volumes of 0.4 mol/l perchloric acid for the determination for sam and sah concentrations (17,18). after centrifugation
at 9000 ⫻ g for 10 min, the perchloric acid supernatants were
neutralized and applied to a c18 seppak cartridge (waters, milford,
ma) to obtain sam and sah. sam and sah were separated and
quantified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and ultraviolet detection using a mobile phase containing 300 ml/l methanol in 5 mmol/l octane sulfonic acid (ph 4)
operated isocratically at 1.2 ml/min. for quantification, standard
curves were generated by adding graded levels of sam and sah
standards to 2-ml aliquots from a pooled hepatic perchloric acid
supernatant and analyzed as described above. compared with standards directly analyzed by hplc, the recoveries of sam and sah
from perchloric acid supernatants were 80 and 97%, respectively.

statistical analysis
data were subjected to a one-way analysis of variance (anova)
(19). a one-way anova on ranks was performed when the tests for
normality and/or equal variance failed. when the differences were
significant (p ⬍ 0.05) means were compared using fisher’s least
significant difference procedure. for correlation analysis, the pearson
correlation procedure was used. all statistical analyses were performed using sigmastat (spss, chicago, il) software.

results
excess dietary methionine reduces weight gain
as has been documented (20,21), there was a retardation of
growth in rats fed excess dietary methionine (fig. 1). growth
retardation was evident in rats fed 1 and 2% excess dietary
methionine but not in those fed 0.5%. this apparent threshold
of excess dietary methionine was supported throughout these
experiments in that many of the measures exhibited a dose
response to excess dietary methionine at levels ⬎0.5%. the
toxicity and growth inhibition associated with excess methionine consumption were the result of both a suppression of
food consumption and a decrease in food efficiency, the latter
supported by the greater weight gain exhibited by the pair-fed
group shown in figure 1. a similar growth suppression was
observed in experiment series 2 as well as a decrease in the
relative liver size by rats fed the 2% methionine-supplemented
diet (data not shown).

for 30 min. unreacted sam was removed by the addition of activated
charcoal and an aliquot of the subsequent supernatant was subjected
to liquid scintillation counting. the assay was linear with respect to
both protein concentration and incubation time. for the measurement of relative  xxxg928xxx  protein abundance, 75 ␮g of total protein
was denatured, loaded onto a 10 –20% gradient polyacrylamide sodium  xxxd3215xxx  gel and run using a tris-glycine buffer system.
separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose and blocked for 1 h with tween tris-buffered saline (ttbs)
buffer [20 mmol/l tris (ph 7.5), 500 mmol/l nacl, 500 ␮l/l tween
20] containing 50 g/l nonfat dry milk. after subsequent washing with
ttbs, membranes were incubated overnight at 4°c with affinitypurified polyclonal  xxxg928xxx  antibodies in 10 g/l bsa/ttbs (1/1000).
 xxxg928xxx  protein monomer (⬃32 kda) was detected using a goat
anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (southern biotechnology associates, birmingham, al) in ttbs (1/5000) and
chemiluminescence detection. the relative density of the protein
bands was quantified using national institutes of health image (experiment series 1) or sigmagel (ssps, chicago, il) software (experiment series 2).

and  xxxg928xxx  abundance dose dependently
the hepatic activity of  xxxg928xxx  was 120 and 160% greater
in rats fed 2% methionine than in the control (0% supplemental methionine) and pair-fed control groups, respectively
(fig. 2a). the 1% methionine group also had 74% greater
 xxxg928xxx  activity than the pair-fed group although it did not
differ from the control group. the control group and rats fed
the 0.5% methionine diet also did not differ. changes in
 xxxg928xxx  activity due to excess dietary methionine were reflected in the relative abundance of  xxxg928xxx  protein as determined by band density (fig. 2b). compared with the pair-fed
and control groups, the 1% methionine-fed rats had 90 and
140% greater  xxxg928xxx  abundance, respectively, whereas in the
2% methionine group the elevations were 180 and 250%.
similar to  xxxg928xxx  activity, rats supplemented with 0.5% methionine did not differ from the control or pair-fed groups. a

hepatic  xxxg928xxx  activity and abundance in the methionine
dose-response study (experiment series 1) (r ⫽ 0.734, p
⬍ 0.001; fig. 3) suggest that newly synthesized  xxxg928xxx  protein after excess dietary methionine was primarily in its enzymatically active form. this was supported further by the use of
disuccinyl suberate as a cross-linking agent to determine the
oligomeric state of  xxxg928xxx . the enzymatic function of  xxxg928xxx 
occurs when it is in a homotetramer form, whereas it functions
as a binding protein in its homodimer state (22,23). liver
extracts obtained from both control and methionine-supplemented rats demonstrated that the majority of  xxxg928xxx  was
endogenously present in its active tetrameric (128-kda) form
rather than its monomeric (32-kda) or dimeric (64-kda)
states (data not shown).

excess dietary methionine alters s-adenosyl amino acid
concentrations in specific tissues
compared with the pair-fed controls, hepatic sam was
markedly elevated by excess dietary methionine, 10- and 23fold in the 1 and 2% methionine-supplemented groups, respectively (table 1). sah was also increased by 31 and 260%,
respectively, in liver of rats fed 1 and 2% excess dietary
methionine. the changes in sam and sah were such that
both groups receiving excess dietary methionine had similar
sixfold elevations in the sam:sah ratio compared with their
respective pair-fed controls. the kidney sam concentration
also was increased 72% in rats fed 2% methionine and the
sam:sah ratio was 68 and 27% greater in those fed 1 and
2% methionine, respectively, compared with their pair-fed
controls, increases much less than those in liver.

discussion
 xxxg928xxx  is a key protein in the regulation of methyl group
metabolism and transmethylation reactions. we, in this report, and others (24 –27) have shown that hepatic  xxxg928xxx 
activity reflects the changes in methionine supply, a relationship that is dependent on the allosteric and posttranslational
control that exists between the folate-dependent one-carbon
pool and methyl group metabolism to regulate  xxxg928xxx  activity
without altering the abundance of the protein (10,11). however, our novel finding indicates that transcriptional/translational regulation and/or protein degradation likely plays an
important role in the hepatic response of  xxxg928xxx  to methionine, as indicated by the increase in  xxxg928xxx  protein in response to excess dietary methionine. ogawa and fujioka (27)
also observed this in an immunotitration of rabbit  xxxg928xxx 
antiserums against liver supernatants derived from control and
high-methionine (3%)-fed rats. our studies expand on this
earlier finding by 1) directly and quantitatively demonstrating
that activation of  xxxg928xxx  by methionine involves an increase
in the abundance of the 32-kda monomer; 2) demonstrating
that the methionine-inducible regulation of  xxxg928xxx  was a
dose-dependent process above a threshold level of excess di-

(table 2). overall, changes in  xxxg928xxx  activity in the liver and
kidney due to treatment were similar to the corresponding
alterations in intracellular sam concentrations (table 1). for
liver, the increases in  xxxg928xxx  activity and abundance shown
here for experiment series 2 were similar to those in the
experiment series 1 dose-response study (fig. 2). one exception was that  xxxg928xxx  activity in the 1% methionine group was
significantly greater (40%) than in its pair-fed control group.
again, the changes in hepatic  xxxg928xxx  activity were reflected
in the relative abundance of the protein in the liver. kidney
was less responsive to excess dietary methionine; only rats fed
the 2% methionine diet had a significant increase (79%) in
 xxxg928xxx  activity. no discernible immunoreactive band was
observed at the proper molecular weight for kidney samples
and thus we could not determine whether the abundance of
 xxxg928xxx  protein reflects the changes in renal  xxxg928xxx  activity.
the basis for the  xxxg928xxx  antibody not reacting with renal
 xxxg928xxx  protein is unknown and previous work in the literature has not reported tissue-specific differences in the molecular weight of  xxxg928xxx . for pancreatic tissue, neither the
activity of  xxxg928xxx  nor its abundance was altered by the dietary
treatments.

excess dietary methionine increases hepatic  xxxg928xxx 

rats (36) but not in the ar42j pancreatic cell line (44). in
sheep with diabetes, a condition that markedly increases hepatic  xxxg928xxx  activity, no change was found in pancreatic
 xxxg928xxx  activity (45). regardless, we found that both the
activity and abundance of pancreatic  xxxg928xxx  was unresponsive to excess dietary methionine. thus, a number of important differences appear to be present in hepatic and pancreatic
 xxxg928xxx  and methyl group metabolism. in support of this, we
have recently found that both the kidney and pancreas are
insensitive to modulation of  xxxg928xxx  and methyl group metabolism by retinoid compounds in contrast to the marked
response in liver (28).
in summary, we have clearly shown that regulation of
 xxxg928xxx  by methionine involves a mechanistic component
that results in an increase of  xxxg928xxx  protein abundance.
previous work with respect to  xxxg928xxx  regulation has shown
that modulation of its activity is accomplished by regulation of
existing protein. this includes allosteric regulation by sam,
inhibition by folate ligands and posttranslational modification
of the protein by phosphorylation (10,11,42,43). an increase
in  xxxg928xxx  protein abundance by excess dietary methionine
may involve an increase in transcription or mrna stabilization or a decrease in  xxxg928xxx  degradation. the relative contributions of these mechanisms to  xxxg928xxx  regulation, whether
modulated by methionine supply or retinoid administration,
remain a focus for future work. likewise, understanding the
contrasting regulation of  xxxg928xxx  in different tissues may begin
to provide insight into the role of  xxxg928xxx  in those locations.

etary methionine; and 3) showing that  xxxg928xxx  regulation by
excess dietary methionine was liver specific. for alterations in
 xxxg928xxx  activity, the only other report demonstrating that
changes in  xxxg928xxx  abundance was involved in the regulation
of  xxxg928xxx  activity was our earlier work reporting that retinoid
compounds markedly elevated the activity and abundance of
hepatic  xxxg928xxx  (12,13). recently, we have reported that
retinoid-mediated regulation of  xxxg928xxx  activity and abundance was also liver specific (28).  xxxg928xxx  is a bifunctional
protein that is also involved in detoxification processes. the
32-kda protein, as a homotetramer, possesses  xxxg928xxx  activity,
whereas the dimeric form of the protein functions as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-binding protein (22,23). for the
latter, it has been demonstrated that the gene is inducible by
benzo-a-pyrene following its transfection into chinese hamster ovary cells (29). the only other report of transcriptional/
translational control of  xxxg928xxx  was the observation that it is
sexually dimorphic in mice and is regulated by growth hormone (30).
 xxxg928xxx  has been shown to be present in large quantities in
both the kidney and pancreas in addition to the liver
(7,31,32). we have found in these studies that the regulation
of  xxxg928xxx  by methionine was tissue specific. kidney  xxxg928xxx 
exhibited some response to dietary methionine but appeared to
be much less sensitive than liver. this is surprising, because
others have shown that the kidney represents a tissue that is
resistant to alterations in methyl group supply (33–36), although no information on renal  xxxg928xxx  regulation exists. in
contrast to our results for kidney samples, pancreatic tissue was
unresponsive to methionine supplementation. a number of
reports have shown that regulation of methyl group metabolism and  xxxg928xxx  in the pancreas is similar to those of hepatic
 xxxg928xxx  (24,36 –38). taken together, these results represent an
interesting finding with respect to the known characteristics of
methionine and folate metabolism in these three tissues. as
summarized by finkelstein (39), the response of the liver to
changes in methionine availability is catabolic, whereas the
kidney aims to conserve methionine. this is due primarily to
the tissue-specific kinetic properties of the enzymes involved
in folate and methyl group metabolism. for example, methionine adenosyltransferase (mat), the enzyme that catalyzes
the activation of methionine to sam, exists in a number of
kinetically distinct isoforms. hepatic mat has the ability to
respond to changes in methionine supply and begins to catabolize the excess methionine by converting it to sam (33,39 –
41). in contrast, the kidney form of mat is typically saturated
at physiological methionine concentrations (39).
our data confirm this description of liver methionine metabolism; however, they also indicate that there exists an
unidentified signal that results in an increase in  xxxg928xxx  protein abundance in response to changes in methionine concentration. methionine, sam, or another metabolite related to
methyl group metabolism may mediate changes, directly or
indirectly, in  xxxg928xxx  expression, translation or turnover of the
protein. the changes in enzymatic  xxxg928xxx  activity observed
in the kidney appear to be related to the intracellular concentrations of sam. however, this may reflect only positive
modulation of  xxxg928xxx  by sam (42,43) because we were
unable to determine the renal abundance of  xxxg928xxx  in response to excess dietary methionine. for pancreas, little information exists with respect to excess dietary methionine. it has
been shown to be similar to the liver in a number of metabolic
respects, including its response to a deficiency of methyl groups
and/or folate (24,37,38,43). although it does not possess the
hepatic form of mat, an increase in pancreatic sam following dietary methionine supplementation has been reported in
