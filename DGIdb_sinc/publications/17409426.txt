abstract
to determine the role of 14-3-3 in colorectal cancer apoptosis
induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids),
we evaluated the effects of  xxxd3259xxx  on 14-3-3e protein
expression in colorectal cancer cells.  xxxd3260xxx  inhibited
14-3-3e proteins in ht-29 and dld-1 cells in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone at 600
mmol/l inhibited 14-3-3e protein expression in ht-29. indomethacin and sc-236, a selective  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2)
inhibitor, exerted a similar effect as  xxxd3259xxx .  xxxd3259xxx  suppressed 14-3-3e promoter activity. as 14-3-3e promoter
activation is mediated by peroxisome proliferator–activated
receptor d ( xxxg1806xxx ), we determined the correlation between
14-3-3e inhibition and  xxxg1806xxx  suppression by nsaids.  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide inhibited  xxxg1806xxx  protein expression and  xxxg1806xxx 
transcriptional activity. overexpression of  xxxg1806xxx  by adenoviral transfer rescued 14-3-3e proteins from elimination by
 xxxd3259xxx  or indomethacin. nsaid-induced 14-3-3e suppression was associated with reduced cytosolic bad with elevation
of mitochondrial bad and increase in apoptosis which was
rescued by ad- xxxg1806xxx  transduction. stable expression of 14-33e in ht-29 significantly protected cells from apoptosis. our
findings shed light on a novel mechanism by which nsaids
induce colorectal cancer apoptosis via the  xxxg1806xxx /14-3-3e
transcriptional pathway. these results suggest that 14-3-3e is a
target for the prevention and therapy of colorectal cancer.

introduction
human and animal studies have shown that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) suppress colorectal tumorigenesis
(1). population-based epidemiologic studies have shown that use of
aspirin and nsaid reduces risk of colorectal cancer (2, 3). animal
experiments provide evidence for control of colorectal cancer by
nsaids such as  xxxd3259xxx  and selective  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2)
inhibitors (4, 5). results from clinical trials have documented the
efficacy of  xxxd3259xxx  and selective cox-2 inhibitors in reducing the
size and numbers of colon adenomatous polyps in patients with
familial adenomatous polyposis, a precancerous condition (6, 7).
the action of nsaids on controlling colorectal cancer is attributed
to the inhibition of cox-2 (8), which is overexpressed in a majority
of patients with colorectal cancer (9, 10). nsaid could also exert its
action on colorectal cancer in a cox-2–independent manner (11).
it is well documented that nsaids, notably  xxxd3259xxx , indometh-

acin, and selective cox-2 inhibitors exert their actions by inducing
colorectal cancer cell apoptosis (12, 13). the mechanism by which
these agents induce apoptosis is not entirely clear. it was proposed
that nsaid-induced apoptosis might be mediated by downregulation of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-y (ppary;
ref. 14). several studies have shown that ppary is overexpressed in
colorectal cancer and ppary is activated by prostacyclin generated
by colorectal cancer cells (15). activation of ppary accelerates
intestinal adenoma growth whereas genetic disruption of ppary
decreases the tumorigenicity of human colorectal cancer cells
(16, 17). it has been reported that ppary plays an important role in
cellular resistance to apoptotic insults (18, 19). activation of ppary
was reported to be associated with increased expression of
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and activation of akt (20).
akt is recognized as a key signaling molecule for transmitting
survival messages. we have recently reported that ppary activation
by prostacyclin or  xxxd745xxx , a synthetic ppary ligand, increases the
expression of 14-3-3 proteins, especially the 14-3-3q isoform (21).
promoter analysis identifies three ppar response elements (ppre)
located between 1426 and 1477 of the 14-3-3q promoter region.
deletion of these ppres abrogates the protective effect of
prostacyclin or  xxxd745xxx  (21). our previous findings suggest that
ppary-mediated 14-3-3q up-regulation plays a crucial role in
endothelial cell resistance to apoptosis (21). it is unclear whether
14-3-3q is involved in colorectal cancer cell survival. we postulated
in this study that nsaids induce apoptosis by reducing 14-3-3q via
suppressing ppary. reduction in 14-3-3q protein levels results in
mitochondrial bad translocation and colorectal cancer cell
apoptosis. the results show that  xxxd3260xxx ,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone,
indomethacin, and sc-236 suppressed ht-29 14-3-3q protein and
promoter activity, which correlated with the suppression of ppary
protein expression. the reduction in 14-3-3q levels was accompanied by enhanced mitochondrial bad translocation and ht-29
apoptosis.

materials and methods
cell culture and reagents. ht-29 and dld-1 cells were obtained from
american type culture collection (manassas, va). ht-29 were maintained
in dmem and dld-1 were maintained in rpmi 1604 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin at 37jc in a humidified
5% co2 atmosphere. cell culture media and antibiotics were purchased
from brl life technologies (grand island, ny).  xxxd3260xxx  and
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone were obtained from icn biomedicals, inc. (solon, oh).
indomethacin, sc-236, mg-132, and cell-permeable  xxxg341xxx  inhibitor, acdved aldehyde (devd-cho), were from calbiochem (san diego, ca). we
used 10 amol/l of mg-132 and 50 amol/l of devd-cho, which were
reported to block proteasome and  xxxg341xxx  activities, respectively (22, 23).
recombinant adenoviral vectors. replication-defective recombinant
adenoviruses were generated by homologous recombination and amplified
in 293 cells as described previously (24, 25). the recombinant viruses were
purified by cscl density gradient centrifugation and the virus titers were
determined by a plaque assay as previously described (24). ad-ppary was

ht-29 cells were transfected with ad-gfp (green fluorescent protein) or
ad-ppary at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 50 for 48 h before treatment
with indomethacin or  xxxd3260xxx .
preparation of mitochondrial fraction. ht-29 cells treated with
indicated reagents ( xxxd3260xxx , 160 amol/l;  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, 300 amol/l;
indomethacin, 800 amol/l; or sc-236, 40 amol/l) for 8 h were washed
thrice with pbs and harvested by centrifugation. mitochondrial fractions
were prepared by a mitochondria isolation kit (sigma, st. louis, mo) as
described previously (26). the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were
purified by two-step gradient centrifugation and stored at 20jc.
mitochondrial bad protein level was analyzed by western blotting. heat
shock protein 60 (hsp60) was used as a mitochondrial marker.
immunoprecipitation. ht-29 cells treated with the indicated reagents
were harvested and lysed in 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
(upstate, charlottesville, va) with cocktail protease inhibitors (sigma).
lysate proteins (200 ag) were immunoprecipitated with a human 14-3-3q
antibody. the immunoprecipitated complex was pulled down with protein
a/g-agarose (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca). after washing five
times, the proteins were analyzed by western blotting using a bad antibody.
western blot analysis. cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. protein concentrations were
determined by a bio-rad (hercules, ca) protein assay kit. cell lysate
proteins (25 ag) were applied to each lane and analyzed by western blots as
previously described (25). rabbit polyclonal antibodies against 14-3-3q
(diluted at 1:250), and goat polyclonal antibodies against hsp60 (1:2,000)
were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology. rabbit polyclonal antibody
against ppary (1:500) was obtained from cayman chemical (ann arbor,
mi). rabbit polyclonal antibody against bad (1:500) was purchased from
cell signaling (beverly, ma). monoclonal antibody against actin (1:5,000)
was obtained from oncogene (boston, ma). donkey anti-rabbit or donkey
anti-mouse igg conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased
from santa cruz biotechnology. protein bands were visualized by an
enhanced chemiluminescence system (pierce, rockford, il).
assay of apoptosis. apoptotic cells were analyzed by hoechst staining
according to the instructions of the manufacturer (invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca).  xxxd2284xxx  is a cell-permeable dye which is sensitive to nuclear
dna damage and is useful in detecting apoptosis of unfixed living cells (27).
in brief, ht-29 cells transiently transfected with ad-ppary, ad-gfp, or
stably transfected ht-29 cells were treated with 160 amol/l of  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide for 24 h. after washing, they were incubated with 1 ag/ml of

 xxxd2284xxx  in the dark for 15 min, centrifuged and washed with pbs.
the washed cells were examined under fluorescent microscopy (excitation
at 352 nm and emission at 461 nm). apoptotic cells exhibited strong nuclear
staining with overt nuclear morphologic changes as previously described
(27). the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by counting at least
200 cells.
plasmid constructs and luciferase reporter assay. a human 14-3-3q
expression construct was amplified by pcr and subcloned into pcdna 3.1+
vector (invitrogen) and a 14-3-3q promoter subcloned into  xxxg2041xxx  vector
were prepared as previously described (21). ppre reporter (14) was kindly
provided by drs. kinzler and vogelstein at johns hopkins university. for
the luciferase assay, cells were transfected with the reporter constructs by
effectene transfection kit (qiagen, valencia, ca) for 48 h. after treatment
with the indicated reagents, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was
measured using a kit from promega (madison, wi), and the emitted light
was determined in a luminometer.
establishment of 14-3-3e stable cell line. control vector (pcdna3.1+)
and human 14-3-3q expression vectors which contain a neomycin-resistant
cassette were transfected into ht-29 cells by using an effectene transfection
kit for 48 h. the transfected cells were screened by incubation with 500 ag/ml
of  xxxg418xxx  (sigma) for 4 weeks. the cell lines which stably expressed 14-3-3q
were isolated from individual colonies and maintained in dmem with 10%
fetal bovine serum and 200 ag/ml of  xxxg418xxx .
statistical analysis. anova was used to analyze statistical differences
among multiple groups. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

suppression of 14-3-3e by  xxxd3260xxx  and cox-2
inhibitors. to evaluate the effect of  xxxd3259xxx  on 14-3-3q protein
levels, we treated ht-29 with  xxxd3260xxx  at 0 to 160 amol/l
for 4 to 24 h. 14-3-3q proteins were analyzed by western blotting.
 xxxd3260xxx  did not have an effect at 4 h of treatment,
suppressed 14-3-3q at 8 h only at 160 amol/l, and exerted a
concentration-dependent inhibition of 14-3-3q at 24 h of treatment
(fig. 1a).  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone had no effect at 300 amol/l but
suppressed 14-3-3q expression at 600 amol/l (fig. 1b). indomethacin, a nonselective cox inhibitor, or sc-236, a selective cox-2
inhibitor, also concentration-dependently inhibited 14-3-3q protein

dld-1 with a pattern similar to that of ht-29 (fig. 1d).
inhibition of 14-3-3e promoter activity by  xxxd3260xxx .
to determine whether  xxxd3260xxx  inhibits 14-3-3q at the
transcription level, we transfected ht-29 with a human 14-3-3q
promoter construct ( 1628/+24) and treated the transfected cells
with various concentrations of  xxxd3260xxx  for 24 h.  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide concentration-dependently inhibited 14-3-3q promoter
activity (fig. 2a).  xxxd3259xxx -induced 14-3-3q protein suppression
was not influenced by mg-132, a proteasome inhibitor, or devdcho, a  xxxg341xxx  inhibitor (fig. 2b). taken together, these results
suggest that  xxxd3259xxx  suppresses 14-3-3q primarily at the transcriptional level.
restoration of 14-3-3e by adenoviral  xxxg1806xxx  transfer. we
have recently discovered that 14-3-3q transcription is mediated by
ppary (21). we were, therefore, interested in learning whether
 xxxd3259xxx -induced 14-3-3q suppression involves ppary. ht-29 cells
were treated with  xxxd3260xxx  (160 amol/l) or indomethacin
(800 amol/l) for 24 h and ppary proteins were analyzed by
western blots. ppary levels became undetectable following
treatment with either agent (fig. 3a). to ensure that ppary is
active in ht-29, we transfected the cells with a ppre construct and
treated the cells with  xxxd3260xxx  for 24 h.  xxxd3259xxx  reduced the
ppre activity in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 3b). to
determine whether ppary overexpression rescues 14-3-3q from
 xxxd3259xxx  or indomethacin suppression, we transduced ht-29 with

www.aacrjournals.org

ad-ppary (50 moi) or ad-gfp control (50 moi). ppary protein
levels were increased by ad-ppary transduction (fig. 4a), which is
accompanied by enhanced ppre activity (fig. 4b) and 14-3-3q
promoter activity (fig. 4c). ppary proteins in ad-ppary–
transduced cells were not altered by  xxxd3259xxx  or indomethacin
(fig. 4a), but the ppary transcriptional activity (fig. 4b) and
the 14-3-3q promoter activity (fig. 4c) were partially suppressed.
14-3-3q proteins were increased by ad-ppary overexpression which
were suppressed by  xxxd3260xxx  and indomethacin (fig. 4d).
mitochondrial bad translocation and cell death by  xxxd3259xxx 
and cox-2 inhibitors. 14-3-3 proteins bind phosphorylated bad
and sequester it in cytosol. apoptotic signals induce bad to release
from 14-3-3 and translocate to the mitochondria where it disrupts
the protective action of  xxxg251xxx , thereby promoting apoptosis via
the mitochondrial pathway (28, 29). it was reported that upregulation of 14-3-3q protein levels by ppary ligands enhances bad
binding and reduces bad translocation to mitochondria (21).
because  xxxd3259xxx  suppresses 14-3-3q in ht-29, it is predicted that
 xxxd3259xxx  reduces cytosolic bad sequestration and reciprocally
enhances bad localization to mitochondria. to confirm this, we did
two types of experiments. first, we prepared mitochondrial and
cytosolic fractions from ht-29 treated with or without  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide or sulfone, indomethacin, or sc-236, and bad in the
mitochondrial fraction was analyzed by western blotting. as a
control, the mitochondria-resident protein hsp60 was concurrently
analyzed. second, we immunoprecipitated cell lysates of ht-29

treated with or without  xxxd3260xxx  or indomethacin by a
14-3-3q antibody and analyzed bad in the immunoprecipitate
with a bad antibody. the results show that in the absence of
nsaids, most bad were localized to the cytosol, whereas hsp60
was predominantly detected in the mitochondrial fraction with
a trace quantity detected in the cytosolic fraction (fig. 5a). bad
was detected at a very low level in mitochondrial fraction
(fig. 5a).  xxxd3259xxx  and indomethacin enhanced mitochondrial
bad (fig. 5a) and suppressed binding of bad to 14-3-3q (fig. 5b).
sc-236 enhanced mitochondrial bad to an extent comparable
to  xxxd3260xxx  and indomethacin (fig. 5a). these results
suggest that  xxxd3259xxx , indomethacin and sc-236 induce bad
translocation to mitochondria as a consequence of severe 14-3-3q
suppression.

 xxxd3260xxx  and indomethacin induced ht-29 apoptosis as
evidenced by an increase in hoechst-positive cells. apoptosis was
reduced by transduction of cells with ad-ppary (fig. 5c). to
ascertain the role of 14-3-3q in nsaid-induced ht-29 apoptosis,
we prepared a ht-29 cell line overexpressing 14-3-3q (ht-2914-3-3q)
and a control cell line (ht-29ctr; fig. 6a). in ht-29 control cells,
 xxxd3259xxx  suppressed 14-3-3q proteins (fig. 6a) accompanied by a
large increase in apoptosis (fig. 6b). overexpression of 14-3-3q
proteins in ht-2914-3-3q cells (fig. 6a) prevented apoptosis by >50%
(fig. 6b).

discussion
our findings show for the first time that  xxxd3259xxx  and other
nsaids drastically suppress 14-3-3q expression in colorectal
cancer cells, resulting in reduced bad sequestration in cytosol,
increased mitochondrial bad, and enhanced apoptosis. the 14-3-3
family comprises at least seven members in mammalian cells (30).
they share sequence homology and biochemical properties,
interact with more than 100 cellular proteins, and have diverse
biological activities (31). they bind phosphorylated bad, thereby
sequestering bad in cytosol and suppressing bad-induced
mitochondrial injury and the consequential apoptosis via the
intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway (32). it was reported
in endothelial cells that among the 14-3-3 members, 14-3-3q is
expressed in abundance, and its cellular level is regulated and
is crucial in protecting cells from oxidative damage (21). the
results in this study show that 14-3-3q is constitutively expressed
in ht-29 and dld-1 cells and is a target of nsaid-induced
apoptosis.  xxxd3259xxx , indomethacin, and sc-236 suppress 14-3-3q
expression in ht-29 accompanied by increased translocation of
bad to mitochondria and apoptosis. stable overexpression of
14-3-3q alleviates  xxxd3259xxx -induced apoptosis. taken together,
these results strongly suggest that the suppression of 14-3-3q is
a major mechanism by which nsaids induce colorectal cancer
apoptosis.

14-3-3e in colorectal cancer cells

14-3-3q transcription requires ppary and is regulated by the
level of ppary, as evidenced by increased 14-3-3q proteins in
ad-ppary–transduced cells. our results are consistent with a
previous report that  xxxd3259xxx  suppresses ppary transcription
activity (14), and provide new data which attribute reduced ppary
transcription activity to the suppression of ppary protein
expression. the results show a good correlation between sulindacand indomethacin-induced 14-3-3q and ppary suppressions.
furthermore, ppary overexpression by ad-ppary transduction
rescues 14-3-3q from suppressions by  xxxd3260xxx  at 80 amol/l
or indomethacin at 400 amol/l. these data indicate that  xxxd3259xxx 
and other nsaids suppress ppary expression, thereby blocking
ppary-mediated 14-3-3q transcription. although ad-ppary abrogates 14-3-3q suppression by  xxxd3259xxx  and indomethacin at 80 and
300 amol/l, respectively, it only partially corrected 14-3-3q levels
suppressed by higher concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  (160 amol/l)
or indomethacin (800 amol/l). lack of complete correction by
ad-ppary may be due to the following reasons. first, activated
ppary promotes transcription by forming a heterodimer with
rxr nuclear receptor (14). overexpression of ppary alone without
concurrent rxr overexpression may, therefore, be inadequate to
exert maximal transcriptional activation. second,  xxxd3259xxx  and
other nsaids have diverse cox-2–dependent and cox-2–independent effects on signaling transduction and gene expression.
lack of a complete rescue of 14-3-3q suppression and cell apoptosis
may suggest that ppary is not the only pathway via which nsaids
suppress 14-3-3q. furthermore, differential effects of ad-ppary
(50 moi) on rescuing 80 versus 160 amol/l  xxxd3259xxx -induced 14-3-3q
suppression may reflect dose-dependent effects on diverse cellular
functions. lastly, lack of a correlation between the magnitude of
ppary overexpression and 14-3-3q rescue could also be attributed
to the requirement of ppary posttranslational modification for its
full transactivation activity. because neither mg-132 nor devdcho blocks the 14-3-3q–suppressing effect of  xxxd3259xxx , it is unlikely

that the reduction in 14-3-3q protein levels are due to degradation
by ubiquitin-proteasome or  xxxg341xxx .
ppary expression is regulated by the h-catenin-tcf (t cell factor)
transcriptional program (14). the wild-type  xxxg170xxx  tumor suppressor gene product binds and targets
h-catenin for degradation, thereby suppressing ppary expression
(14).  xxxg170xxx  mutation results in increased
h-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus and complexes with
tcf to form an active transcription factor that binds to specific
responsive elements on ppary and up-regulates ppary expression
in familial adenomatous polyposis (14, 33). it is reported that
 xxxd3259xxx  and celecoxib inhibit h-catenin expression and/or the
transcriptional activity of the h-catenin/tcf complex (34, 35). it
is, therefore, possible that  xxxd3259xxx , sc-236, and other nsaids
suppress ppary expression through the h-catenin/tcf transcription pathway.
 xxxd3259xxx  and other nsaids may induce colorectal cancer cell
apoptosis by cox-2–dependent and cox-2–independent mechanisms (36–39). cox-2 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and
cox-2-derived prostaglandin i2 (pgi2) has been shown to activate
ppary in colorectal cancer cells (15). ppary activation confers
resistance to apoptosis in colorectal cancer as well as a number of
non–cancer cells such as endothelial, renal interstitial, cardiomyocytes and keratinocytes (18, 19, 21).  xxxd3260xxx  and selective
cox-2 inhibitors may induce apoptosis by blocking cox-2 derived
pgi2 production, thereby suppressing ppary activation and the
antiapoptosis action of ppary. cox-2–derived  xxxd1903xxx 
(pge2) up-regulates h-catenin expression (40) and nsaids may
further suppress h-catenin–mediated ppary expression by blocking pge2 production. however, a recent report has shown that
 xxxd3259xxx , selective cox-2 inhibitors, and a host of classic nsaids
inhibit h-catenin by a cox-2–independent mechanism (41). our
results reveal that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, which does not inhibit cox-2,
is capable of inhibiting 14-3-3q expression, suggesting that nsaids

figure 6. 14-3-3q overexpression rescued ht-29 from
apoptosis. ht-29 stably transfected with 14-3-3q
(ht-2914-3-3q) and control (ht-29ctr) were treated with or
without  xxxd3260xxx  (160 amol/l) for 24 h. a, 14-3-3q
proteins were analyzed by western blotting. b, apoptosis
was analyzed by hoechst staining. columns, mean of
three independent experiments; bars, sd. c, a schematic
illustration of multiple biochemical processes via which
nsaids induce apoptosis. process 1 refers to a
cox-2–dependent pathway in which nsaids inhibit
cox-2–derived pgi2 and pge2 productions, and thereby
suppress ppary-mediated 14-3-3q expression. processes
2 and 3 are considered cox-2–independent. in process 2,
nsaids block extracellular signal–regulated kinase (erk )
activation, thereby reducing bad phosphorylation and
enhancing bad translocation to the mitochondria. in
process 3, nsaids inhibit  xxxg251xxx  and bcl-2 protein levels.
a common result of these processes is a reduced ratio
of  xxxg251xxx  and bcl-2 to bad and bax at mitochondria, and an
increased release of proapoptotic factors, notably
smac/diablo from mitochondria into the cytosol which
contribute to  xxxg341xxx  activation and apoptosis.

suppress 14-3-3q by a cox-2–independent mechanism. regardless
of the cox-2 involvement, an important finding is that reduction
in 14-3-3q levels by  xxxd3259xxx  and other nsaids results in a decline
in bad sequestration and an increase in bad translocation to the
mitochondria where bad binds and inactivates the antiapoptotic
bcl-2 family proteins, notably  xxxg251xxx  and bcl-2. it was reported
that  xxxd3259xxx  suppresses  xxxg251xxx  expression, creating an imbalance
between  xxxg251xxx  and bax, and subsequent mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis (42). moreover,  xxxd3259xxx  inhibits bcl-2 expression (43),
further enhancing bad- and bax-mediated mitochondria damage,
smac/diablo release, and apoptosis (44). taken together, our
results and the published data suggest that  xxxd3259xxx  and other
nsaids induce colorectal cancer cell apoptosis by multiple mitochondrial apoptotic processes as proposed in fig. 6c. first,
nsaids suppress ppary, thereby reducing 14-3-3q level and bad
sequestration. second, nsaids inhibit extracellular signal–
regulated kinase, thereby blocking bad phosphorylation (45), and
further reducing bad sequestration leading to excessive bad

translocation to the mitochondria. lastly, nsaids inhibit  xxxg251xxx 
and bcl-2 expression resulting in a reduction in the ratio of
antiapoptotic to proapoptotic bcl-2 family proteins on the
mitochondrial membrane with consequent loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential, release of proapoptotic factors especially
smac/diablo resulting in caspase activation and apoptosis.
these processes are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. as
ppary or 14-3-3q overexpression rescues apoptosis, the ppary/
14-3-3q transcriptional pathway represents a major pathway for
colorectal cancer cell survival.
