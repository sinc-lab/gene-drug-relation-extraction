hyperparathyroidism (hpt) is a significant clinical concern for patients with a
variety of diseases, notably the secondary hpt associated with chronic kidney
disease requiring dialysis. secondary hpt is associated with elevated  xxxg1885xxx  (pth) levels, decreased levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin d,
and disordered mineral levels (usually high calcium and phosphorus). if not
controlled, secondary hpt can result in bone disease, vascular calcification,
and ultimately, patient mortality. established, conventional therapies, such as
1,25 dihydroxyvitamin d analogues (vitamin d analogues) and phosphate
binders, have proven to be inadequate in enabling patients to meet the
national kidney foundation’s-kidney disease outcomes quality initiative
(nkf-k/doqi™) treatment goals for pth, calcium and phosphorus levels. a
novel therapeutic,  xxxd1701xxx  hcl (formerly amg 073;  xxxd1701xxx ® in the us and
 xxxd1701xxx ® in europe; amgen, inc.), binds directly to the calcium-sensing
receptor (car) on the cells of the parathyroid gland, increasing the receptor’s
sensitivity to calcium and reducing pth, serum calcium and phosphorus levels.
treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  in clinical trials has safely and effectively improved
achievement of the nkf-k/doqi™ goals.  xxxd1701xxx  has also reduced serum
calcium levels in patients with primary hpt, including parathyroid carcinoma,
in the clinical trial setting. evidence suggesting the utility of  xxxd1701xxx  in
these diseases and the potential for additional therapeutic applications will
be discussed.

introduction

excessive secretion of  xxxg1885xxx  (pth), an important regulator of serum
calcium and phosphorus levels, plays a key role in the pathology of disparate diseases
through the resulting misregulation of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. pth
acts by mobilising serum calcium from bone [1,2] and increasing tubular reabsorption of calcium [3] and tubular excretion of phosphorus [4] in the kidney. primary
hyperparathyroidism (hpt), such as that associated with parathyroid carcinoma [5],
arises from a direct perturbation of the parathyroid gland. the elevated pth
observed in secondary hpt, however, arises as a consequence of a separate pathology. an excellent example is the hpt observed in patients receiving dialysis for
advanced chronic kidney disease (ckd).
the regulation (and dysregulation) of pth release in advanced ckd is an
extremely complex process, a full discussion of which is beyond the scope of this
review. three key regulatory components, however, are serum calcium, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin d (vitamin d), and serum phosphorus levels. serum calcium is the
primary regulator of pth secretion, accomplished through interactions with the
 xxxg343xxx  (car), a g protein-coupled receptor which is sensitive to
extracellular calcium levels [6] through acidic residues in the second extracellular
loop [7]. under physiological conditions, high calcium levels result in decreased

pth secretion. however, in secondary hpt, patients can
exhibit elevated pth, despite elevated calcium levels resulting
from therapies such as dialysis or supplemental calcium
intake. in later stages of the disease, this situation can become
exacerbated due to the interplay of skeletal resistance to the
effects of pth [8], parathyroid hyperplasia [9], and an apparent resulting increase in the set point for calcium [10],
although this last factor is controversial [11]. physiological regulation of pth can also be mediated through the actions of
vitamin d and serum phosphorus. both vitamin d and serum
phosphorus regulate pth through respective negative [12,13]
and positive [14,15] regulation of pth mrna. additionally,
vitamin d can lead to increased serum calcium levels [16],
which can reduce pth through the car. serum calcium is
also able to effect pth mrna [14,17].
disordered pth regulation and its downstream effects on
serum mineral levels are associated with patient mortality [18]
and morbidity, including cardiovascular calcification [19,20] and
inappropriate bone remodelling (renal osteodystrophy). the
two most common types of renal osteodystrophy are osteitis
fibrosa and adynamic bone disease. osteitis fibrosa is associated with elevated pth levels and is characterised by marrow
fibrosis and increased osteoclastic bone resorption. adynamic
bone disease is associated with low pth levels and is characterised by a pathologically low degree of bone remodelling [21].
2.

unmet medical need

in 2003, the national kidney foundation established aggressive treatment goals for managing pth, calcium, and phosphorus levels, and the resulting ca × p measurement (table 1
[22]). conventional secondary hpt therapies, particularly
active vitamin d analogues and phosphate binders, have failed
to assist the majority of patients to achieve kidney disease
outcomes quality initiative (k/doqi™) bone metabolism
and disease goals [23]. additionally, they can also exacerbate
mineral imbalances, resulting in hypercalcaemia and further
hyperphosphataemia.
rationale, efficacy and limitations of conventional
therapies

2.1

the kidney is a vital physiological source of vitamin d, and in
cases of renal failure, vitamin d levels are reduced. given the
role of vitamin d in the regulation of pth, vitamin d
442

analogues are used in the treatment of secondary hpt. these
vitamin d analogues, including calcitriol,  xxxd2851xxx , and
 xxxd1935xxx , can successfully reduce pth levels [24-27].
however, vitamin d analogue treatment has been associated
with elevated calcium and phosphorous levels in preclinical
[28,29] and clinical [24,25] models, with potential subsequent
hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia. in addition, the
elevated serum mineral levels may require an interruption of
analogue therapy, with the potential for pth levels to return
to pretreatment levels and for disease progression.
hyperphosphataemia is an independent risk factor for
patient mortality in ckd [18,30]. dietary control of phosphate
intake has not proven to be a sufficient mechanism for the
control of serum phosphorus, due largely to poor patient
compliance. dialysis has been reported to remove insufficient
levels of phosphorus in relation to uptake [31]. thus, oral
phosphate binders are commonly used to reduce serum phosphorus levels. initial binders were based on aluminum, which,
although effective, were associated with elevated levels of
serum aluminum [32]. elevated levels of aluminum have been
associated with various toxicities, including bone toxicity
[33,34], neurological symptoms [33], and, preclinically, a
decreased ability to mount a response to infections [35].
the next generation of binders was calcium-based (calcium
acetate and calcium carbonate), and these exhibited encouraging levels of efficacy [36-38]. although calcium-based binders
do not exhibit many of the problems observed with the aluminum-based binders, they have been associated with hypercalcaemia [36,39] and increased calcium load [39].
recently, a novel phosphate binder, sevelamer, has been
brought into the market. this non-aluminum, non-calciumbased phosphate binder reduced serum phosphorus
[36,38,40,41], and has been shown to affect ca × p [41], calcium
[41], and pth [40] with a lower incidence of hypercalcaemia
than observed with calcium-based binders [36]. however, evidence suggests that sevelamer may not be able to control
phosphorus and ca x p as well as calcium acetate [42]. in addition, sevelamer acts as a bile-acid binding resin, and as such,
results in decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
[36,41]. the bile-acid binding resin class of cholesterol-lowering
agents has been associated with decreases in vitamin d
absorption and with osteomalacia [43,44], and although the
effect on vitamin d is not consistently found [45,46], these
findings raise the possibility of worsened disease. reduced
vitamin d has been associated with an increased risk for bone
lesions [48], and therefore vitamin d supplementation may be
required [44]. this need, however, although suggested, has not
yet been supported in the literature. sevelamer itself has been
associated with gastrointestinal disturbance [39] and a tendency toward metabolic acidosis [42,47]. regardless of any
potential efficacy and safety issues, there is a high potential for
poor patient compliance due to the high number of large pills
that are required to be taken.
the most recently approved (us fda approval – october
2004) phosphate binder is lanthanum carbonate. lanthanum

carbonate has been shown to reduce serum phosphorus levels
[49] while exhibiting a lower incidence of hypocalcaemia than
patients treated with a calcium-based phosphate binder [50]. in
addition, data have shown that lanthanum treatment can
result in improvements in renal bone disease [50]. however,
due to similarities to aluminum, concerns about long-term
bone safety with lanthanum have been voiced [51]. although
recently presented preliminary evidence suggests that there are
no aluminum-like effects on bone in the clinic [52], the longterm effects are yet to be elucidated.
finally, patients with disease resistant to all other dietary
and pharmacological interventions may require the surgical
removal of the parathyroid glands (parathyroidectomy). the
utility and safety of this procedure has been demonstrated in
the literature [53,54]. however, it has been associated with both
relapse and with permanent hypoparathyroidism [55].

introduction
in secondary hpt, the car-mediated balance between pth
and calcium is often skewed, in that inappropriately high levels
of pth are released based on serum calcium levels. this suggests that increasing the sensitivity of the parathyroid gland to
extracellular calcium through the modulation of the car may
have therapeutic potential. agents that modulate the car are
termed calcimimetics. type i calcimimetics, which may be
referred to as ‘true’ calcimimetics, directly stimulate the car,
and include calcium and other organic or inorganic cations
(reviewed in [56]). however, because they merely mimic the
effect of calcium on the car, the type i calcimimetics have not
been found to have any therapeutic utility for the treatment of
secondary hpt. the type ii calcimimetics, despite their classification, are not calcium mimics, but instead allosterically
modify the car so that it is more sensitive to the actions of
extracellular calcium [56]. although other type ii calcimimetics
have been reported [57] and examined in preclinical [58-61] and
clinical tests [62,63], so far, the only one to be approved for commercial use is  xxxd1701xxx  (formerly amg 073,  xxxd1701xxx ® in the
us,  xxxd1701xxx ® in europe; amgen, inc.) (figure 1).
3.1

pharmacokinetics
evidence suggests that the decrease in pth levels associated
with  xxxd1701xxx  treatment is rapid and transient, with a nadir
occurring within 4 h after dosing, followed by a slow return
3.2

toward predose levels [64,65]. in preliminary results of clinical
trials, the area under the curve (auc) and maximum serum
concentration (cmax) for  xxxd1701xxx  appeared to be dose-related
up to doses of 200 mg/day, after which point no further
increases in exposure were reported [66]. patients administered
a single dose of  xxxd1701xxx  75 mg exhibited similar auc and
cmax regardless of the degree of renal impairment (normal,
mild, moderate or severe), or the dialysis modality [67].
patients with secondary hpt and receiving dialysis are often
prescribed a variety of medications, such as phosphate binders
and antacids, which leads to the potential for pharmacokinetic
interactions. in order to examine this possibility, padhi and
colleagues measured the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1701xxx  with
and without the  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor, pantoprazole, or the
phosphate binders, sevelamer and calcium carbonate, in
healthy volunteers by means of a crossover study. this study
demonstrated that there was no significant interaction
between  xxxd1701xxx  and these commonly-used therapeutics [68].
 xxxd1701xxx  is metabolised, in part, through the actions of
the cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4 isoform. inhibition of this
enzyme may result in increased serum  xxxd1701xxx  levels, and
thus, alterations in the doses of therapeutics that affect
cyp3a4 may require adjustment of the  xxxd1701xxx  dose. additionally,  xxxd1701xxx  functions as a cyp2d6 inhibitor. accordingly, concomitant medications metabolised by this isozyme
(e.g.,  xxxd2113xxx , vinblastine, thioridazine, and most tricyclic
antidepressants) may require alterations in dose in order to
remain within their therapeutic index [69].
efficacy
the utility of  xxxd1701xxx  in the treatment of secondary hpt
has been demonstrated in several clinical trials [64,65,70,71]. in
an early study, patients with secondary hpt receiving haemodialysis were administered  xxxd1701xxx  10 – 50 mg/day or placebo for 8 days. treatment with the higher doses of  xxxd1701xxx 
resulted in reductions in plasma pth, ca × p, calcium, and
phosphorus [64].
two additional 18-week studies explored the efficacy and
safety of  xxxd1701xxx  in dialysis populations with uncontrolled
secondary hpt. patients enrolled in these studies were
required to have a minimum pth of 300 pg/ml, but no upper
limit was established. these trials consisted of two phases, a
12-week dose-titration phase to establish an efficacious dose of
 xxxd1701xxx , and a 6-week maintenance phase exploring the sustainability of the therapeutic effect. patients were treated with
a range of doses (20 – 50 mg/day [70] or 25 – 100 mg/day [65]).
over the maintenance phase, the mean pth, ca × p, calcium,
and phosphorus were reduced following treatment with
 xxxd1701xxx  (table 2).
these positive data were supported and reinforced by a
report combining two major australian, european, and us
phase iii trials. patients with secondary hpt undergoing
dialysis were treated with standard of care therapy (vitamin d
analogues and/or phosphate binders) or standard of care plus
 xxxd1701xxx  (30 – 180 mg/day) for a total of 26 weeks (12-week

titration phase and 14-week efficacy-assessment phase).
patients responded well to  xxxd1701xxx  treatment, with significant reductions in the four key k/doqi laboratory target
guidelines during the efficacy-assessment phase (figure 2). significant differences in pth and ca × p between groups
occurred by 2 weeks after the start of treatment (time course
for calcium and phosphorus levels were not reported). in
addition to the reduction in pth overall, a significant portion (43%; p < 0.001) of  xxxd1701xxx -treated patients achieved
mean pth levels of ≤ 250 pg/ml, the primary study end
point. an even more substantial proportion (64%) achieved a
≥ 30% reduction in pth. similar achievement of the ipth
≥ 30% reduction occurred regardless of baseline pth level
(300 – 500, 501 – 800, > 800 pg/ml) (figure 3). changes in
vitamin d dose appeared to have no significant effect on the
 xxxd1701xxx -induced reductions in pth and ca × p [71]. of
note, the significant improvement in ca × p (-14.6%;
p < 0.001) resulted from significant improvements in both
serum calcium (-6.8%) and phosphorus (-8.4%) levels (both
p < 0.001) following treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  in relation to
placebo (0.5, 0.4 and 0.2%, respectively). these data suggest
that  xxxd1701xxx  treatment could be an effective therapeutic
option, regardless of disease severity of secondary hpt or
vitamin d analogue status.
a third phase iii trial has been conducted, but the data
from this is currently available only in abstract form, and as
such will not be discussed here. however, an analysis of the
pooled data from all three phase iii trials has suggested that
treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  results in notable percentages of
patients achieving not only their pth or ca x p k/doqi
targets, but also both targets concurrently (figure 4) [72].
several preliminary reports have described the long-term
efficacy of  xxxd1701xxx  in patients with secondary hpt who
have entered extension trials following the successful completion of one of a number of  xxxd1701xxx  trials. briefly, these
studies suggest that  xxxd1701xxx  can assist patients to reduce
their pth and ca × p (with these reductions sustained for
up to 1 year after the initiation of therapy [73]), control their
pth and ca × p levels for > 3 years [74], and assist a substantial proportion of patients to achieve the k/doqi targets for
pth and ca × p [75].  xxxd1701xxx  was reported as
444

well-tolerated in all of these studies. it should be remembered
that the patients who entered these trials had previously successfully completed another  xxxd1701xxx  trial, although they
could have received placebo in this earlier trial. these data
are encouraging for the long-term efficacy and safety of
 xxxd1701xxx  in patients with secondary hpt.
preliminary reports focusing on subgroup analyses of data
collected during the phase iii trials have suggested that  xxxd1701xxx  can be used in a variety of patients, demonstrating efficacy in patients who did not receive vitamin d during the
course of therapy [76], and in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis [77]. interim data from two ongoing studies, target
(treatment strategies to achieve recommended k/doqi
goals in esrd subjects on  xxxd1701xxx ) and control
( xxxd1701xxx  open-label study to reach k/doqi levels),
support the ability of  xxxd1701xxx  to maintain or improve
k/doqi variables within target ranges with reduced doses of
vitamin d analogues. in target,  xxxd1701xxx  assisted patients
to achieve target pth while lowering ca × p [78]. similarly, in
control, patients with pth within the target range but
with elevated ca × p exhibited maintenance of pth and
achievement of ca × p goal [79].
3.4

safety

 xxxd1701xxx  treatment was generally well-tolerated in clinical
trials, with most reported adverse events classified as mild or
moderate in intensity, and usually similar to placebo. the most
common adverse events reported tended to be gastrointestinal
[64,65,70,71], including nausea and vomiting (32 and 30%,
respectively, in the currently published phase iii trials [71]).
however, these were mild-to-moderate in severity and short in
duration (when reported), and < 5% of patients withdrew
from the published phase iii trials due to nausea or vomiting
[71]. other reported adverse events included dyspnoea, headache, hypertension, hypotension, and upper respiratory tract
infections. despite the strong calcium-lowering ability of  xxxd1701xxx , no more than 8% of patients receiving dialysis in any
study were reported to have experienced hypocalcaemia
(< 7.5 mg/dl), and those episodes that were reported were
transient and often asymptomatic [64,65,70,71]. although
uncommon, seizures related to hypocalcaemia are possible but

should not be of significant clinical concern with patient monitoring and proper management of the hypocalcaemia.

primary hyperparathyroidism

the availability of  xxxd1701xxx  allows for a new therapeutic
approach to the medical management of primary hpt,
including patients with parathyroid carcinoma. as was
observed in patients with secondary hpt,  xxxd1701xxx  treatment resulted in reduced pth levels in patients with primary
hpt. furthermore, serum calcium levels were reduced following treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  in this patient population without resulting in an increase in urinary calcium, thereby
reducing the risk for hypercalciurea. reported adverse events
were similar in the  xxxd1701xxx - and placebo-treated groups,
and included nausea, headache, parethesia (the three most
commonly reported adverse events), anxiety, asthenia, arthralgia, diarrhoea, dizziness, fatigue, hypocalcaemia, and myalgia
[80,81]. a subset of patients exhibit primary hpt in the form
of parathyroid carcinoma, a rare (< 0.5 in 100,000 persons)
neoplasia characterised by elevated pth and hypercalcaemia
[82]. clinical symptoms of parathyroid carcinoma include
renal stones, renal insufficiency, osteoporosis, and bone pain,
and are believed to be a consequence of elevated pth rather
than a consequence of invasion of vital organs by the neoplasm [82]. although parathyroidectomy is the standard therapy [5,83], complete resection is required and the efficacy of the
technique is associated with the skill and experience of the
surgeon [5,84]. if the patient is not a candidate for surgery, or
the surgery fails, traditional treatment options are limited,
given the poor efficacy of radio- or chemotherapy [5]. two
preliminary reports [85,86] have suggested that  xxxd1701xxx 

decreases blood ionized calcium levels in a dose-responsive
manner. the effect on pth levels in patients with parathyroid carcinomas was more variable, ranging from no longterm notable effect [85] to a marked decrease [86]. unlike the
effect of  xxxd1701xxx  in patients with secondary hpt on dialysis, there is currently no evidence demonstrating that treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  will normalise calcium or pth levels.
however, parathyroid carcinoma tends to exhibit resistance to
traditional nonsurgical interventions, such as radio- or
chemotherapy [5]. this, coupled with the positive safety
record of  xxxd1701xxx  in this population, suggests that  xxxd1701xxx 
is an encouraging advance in patient care.

conclusion

parathyroid gland disorders can arise from variety of aetiologies, and represent a serious clinical concern for patients
and their healthcare providers. one such disorder, hpt secondary to chronic kidney disease, has traditionally been
treated with vitamin d analogues and/or phosphate binders.
although these therapies can be effective, they are associated
with negative clinical characteristics which suggest a better
therapeutic approach should be found. emerging efficacy
and safety data suggests that the recently approved, first-inclass calcimimetic  xxxd1701xxx  may serve in this capacity. treatment of patients with advanced ckd on dialysis with  xxxd1701xxx  results in reductions in pth, ca x p, and serum
calcium and phosphorus levels, and preliminary evidence
suggests that treatment may reduce the rate of parathyroidectomies and fractures [87]. in addition,  xxxd1701xxx  is effective in
the improving serum pth and calcium levels in patients
with parathyroid carcinoma.

future directions

although there is substantial evidence for the efficacy of  xxxd1701xxx  in the reduction of k/doqi parameters in patients
with secondary hpt, a great deal remains to be explored. several preclinical and clinical studies have begun to focus on
additional aspects of secondary hpt therapy, as well as examine further therapeutic opportunities.
preclinical experiments have examined the efficacy of  xxxd1701xxx  in 5/6 nephrectomised (nx) rats with secondary hpt, a
model for advanced ckd in humans. in addition to significantly reducing pth and ionized calcium levels,  xxxd1701xxx 
significantly reduced the number of proliferating nuclear cell
antigen-positive parathyroid gland cells and the weight of the
parathyroid gland in relation to vehicle-treated animals [88].
furthermore, preliminary evidence has suggested that, unlike
treatment with calcitriol, treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  did not
mediate vascular calcification in rats [89]. together, these studies suggest that  xxxd1701xxx  may reduce the risk for these key
consequences of hyperparathyroidism. finally, the potential
therapeutic implication of the role of high dietary phosphorous intake, a significant clinical concern, on the efficacy of
 xxxd1701xxx  was explored. preliminary results from 5/6 nx rats
suggest that elevated dietary intake of phosphorus does not
affect the efficacy of  xxxd1701xxx  in lowering pth [90].
the currently available data have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of  xxxd1701xxx  in the improvement of the key
k/doqi laboratory parameters (pth, ca × p, calcium, and
phosphorus) in patients receiving dialysis. however, although
these are useful measures of patient health and disease, they
do not demonstrate long-term effects, such as improvement
in bone health, reduction in tissue calcification, and fewer
cardiovascular events [71]. pathological elevations in all four
446

of the k/doqi laboratory values have been associated with
an increased risk of patient mortality. furthermore, hyperphosphataemia, hypercalcaemia, and elevated pth have
been associated with a significant increase in the incidence of
all-cause hospitalisation and hyperphosphataemia and elevated pth with cardiovascular and fracture-related hospitalisation [18]. however, although hypercalcaemia has been
associated with increased risk of mortality, hypocalcaemia
(adjusted serum calcium < 8.0 mg/dl) has not [18], suggesting
that aggressive treatment to lower pth and phosphorus
should be pursued, even at the cost of mild hypocalcaemia.
at present, no data on the ability of  xxxd1701xxx  to have an
impact on patient mortality is available. however, a preliminary report of pooled data from five studies suggested that
treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  resulted in a lower incidence of
parathyroidectomy and fractures [87]. although these parent
studies were not designed or powered to assess these parameters [87], the results are encouraging and suggest the need for
additional studies.
 xxxd1701xxx  therapy may also be useful in treatment of earlier disease states. the imbalance in pth and serum mineral
homeostasis is not as profound in patients with earlier stage
ckd as in patients with stage 5 disease, but reduced renal
function has been associated with elevated pth [91,92]. in preliminary reports of clinical trials,  xxxd1701xxx  has shown efficacy
in treating secondary hpt in patients with stage 3 or 4 ckd
[93,94]. similarly, hpt has been reported in patients following
kidney transplant [95]. a substantial proportion (43%) of our
renal transplant patients are included as ckd stage 3, 4, or 5.
although corticosteroid use has been associated with the
development of osteoporosis [96], bone-associated adverse
events are not always linked with steroid use [97]. however,
evidence suggests that elevated rates of bone resorption driven

by hyperparathyroidism appear to be the most important contributing factor for osteopoenia and osteoporosis in male
transplant recipients [98]. therefore, the use of  xxxd1701xxx 
could potentially be applied for controlling secondary hyperparathyroidism in this group of renal patients.
in addition to the demonstrated ability of  xxxd1701xxx  to
induce a marked improvement in disease state markers in
patients with secondary hpt,  xxxd1701xxx  has proven to be efficacious for patients with parathyroid carcinoma. although the
population with this neoplasm is small, the positive results,
combined with the reductions in pth and calcium observed
with  xxxd1701xxx  in other patients with primary hpt [80,81,85],
suggest that it may be an effective therapy in other cases of
primary hpt. primary hpt has been associated with depression [99], thyroid disease [100], neoplasm [101] and increased risk
for fractures [102]. although parathyroidectomy is currently
the elective therapy when possible, the ability to offer patients
with primary hpt a viable option to medically manage their
disease, without the need for surgery, would be a notable
advance in endocrine healthcare management. the feasibility
of this approach is currently under examination in patients
with severe primary hpt or parathyroid carcinoma receiving
 xxxd1701xxx  [201].

expert opinion

 xxxd1701xxx  has only been recently approved in the us and
europe for use in patients with secondary hpt associated
with dialysis and parathyroid carcinoma; however, it has
already made a marked impact on the possibilities of patient
care. conventional therapies for hpt tend to result in only
partial achievement of the treatment goals suggested by the
k/doqi guidelines. the ability of  xxxd1701xxx  to improve not
only pth levels, but to do so while simultaneously decreasing
ca × p, serum calcium and phosphorus suggests that it will be
a useful therapeutic option for patients with secondary hpt.

in some patients, adjunct therapies may be necessary to prevent symptomatic hypocalcaemia.
the complexity of the disease in patients with secondary
hpt, and the desired clinical result of reductions in not only
pth but also in ca x p, serum calcium and phosphorus,
requires an intelligent approach to management. the availability of multiple vitamin d analogues, phosphate binders,
and now  xxxd1701xxx , allows for the tailoring of a patient’s therapeutic regimen. i point the interested reader to a recent
review by cunningham [103] which suggests detailed treatment algorithms for the management of patients with
secondary hpt.
the regulation of pth and serum mineral levels via  xxxd1701xxx  therapy may ultimately have a positive effect on
patient morbidity and mortality. hpt has been associated
with osteitis fibrosa and hypoparathyroidism with adynamic
bone disease. however, preclinical evidence suggests that
transient elevations of pth may stimulate new bone formation. in a series of experiments in a rodent model, multiple
(up to 6) injections of pth were given either within 1 h or
> 6 – 8 h for 18 days. when pth was supplied within 1 h,
serum pth levels returned to background values by 3 h, and
the animals exhibited a significant increase in tibia bone
mineral content (bmc). however, when the injections were
given over 6 h, serum pth returned to near background levels by 8 h, and tibia bmc was significantly reduced [104].
these data suggest that a cyclical exposure to pth, such as
that observed with  xxxd1701xxx  treatment, may not only reduce
the risk of the development of weakened bone structure (adynamic bone disease) or hypocalcaemia, but may actually
improve bone morphology. furthermore, the improvements
in hyperphosphataemia and hypercalcaemia may result in
reduced cardiovascular calcification, and ultimately, fewer
disease-related deaths. formal studies will be needed to
determine the long-term effects of  xxxd1701xxx  therapy on
patient outcomes.

patient responses to  xxxd1701xxx  appear to be independent of
their vitamin d status, allowing for  xxxd1701xxx  to be used
regardless of the presence or absence of this commonly used
treatment. in addition, the preliminary results suggest that
 xxxd1701xxx  may allow the reduction of vitamin d analogues,
thereby helping to alleviate the negative effects associated
with vitamin d analogue therapy. moreover, many patients
are currently inadequately controlled using conventional
therapies. the rapid onset of action and tolerability of  xxxd1701xxx  suggest that patients may be converted to  xxxd1701xxx 
quickly and with small concern for adverse reactions, thereby
subjecting neither the patient nor their healthcare provider to
long and complicated conversion processes. vitamin d analogues can be used as an adjunct therapy for the prevention
of hypocalcaemia. given the potential negative sequelae of
hypocalcaemia (e.g., seizures), strict monitoring of serum calcium to maintain levels within the k/doqi targets
(8.4 – 9.5 mg/dl) is critical.
apparent reductions in car expression have been observed
in neoplastic or hyperplastic parathyroid tissue in comparison
with normal glands. this reduction may be due to an actual
decrease in the number of car in the tissue. alternatively, the
reduction may represent a dilution of the same number of
receptors over a greater tissue area, as the result of glandular
hypertrophy. in this case, car expression per unit area may
have decreased, but the total expression per gland could be
similar to that of normal glands. whether either of these
hypotheses is correct remains to be elucidated. given the key
role of the car in the regulation of serum pth levels, reductions in its expression may be consistent with impaired

control of serum pth levels by extracellular calcium compared with normal parathyroid tissue [105]. in our clinical
experience, in cases of patients with severe secondary hpt,
pth levels decreased following  xxxd1701xxx  therapy, suggesting
that  xxxd1701xxx  remains effective despite reductions in the density of the car. a potential mechanism for this effect is suggested by the finding that calcimimetics can upregulate car
message and protein expression [106]. alternatively, the maximal response to a calcimimetic may occur at concentrations at
which all car are not occupied. in general, active compounds
require only a small fraction of their receptors to be activated
to produce a maximal response, and therefore, the unavailability of the majority of receptors (potentially due to inactivation
or decreased expression) may not affect drug activity. thus,
there may be a superabundance of car, even in situations of
reduced receptor density.
at the time of writing, some very encouraging  xxxd1701xxx 
clinical data are available only in abstract form. while awaiting with anticipation the publication of the full reports arising from these studies, i am encouraged by the results and
the potential that they suggest for the improvement of the
standard of care for patients with dialysis-related hpt and
parathyroid carcinoma. these studies suggest that  xxxd1701xxx 
has untapped therapeutic potential, and that its future
appears bright.
