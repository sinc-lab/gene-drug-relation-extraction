[effects of carbamazepine and  xxxd3564xxx  on dopaminergic system in rat striatum and hippocampus].  the effects of  xxxd3564xxx  and carbamazepine on extracellular and intraneuronal levels of monoamine, its precursor and metabolites were determined in rat striatum and hippocampus. da re-uptake and monoamine oxidase activities were also determined. acute administrations of therapeutic doses of  xxxd3564xxx  and carbamazepine increased the extracellular and intraneuronal levels of monoamine, however, supratherapeutic doses of  xxxd3564xxx  and carbamazepine decreased extra- and intracellular monoamine levels. chronic administrations of therapeutic doses of  xxxd3564xxx  and carbamazepine increased intraneuronal levels of monoamine, while supratherapeutic doses of  xxxd3564xxx  and carbamazepine decreased.  xxxg1358xxx  activity was inhibited by  xxxd3564xxx , and the ic50 values of inhibition by  xxxd3564xxx  for type b monoamine oxidase were 660 microm, however, carbamazepine did not affect monoamine oxidase activity.  xxxd3564xxx  and carbamazepine showed no effect on monoamine re-uptake within therapeutically relevant concentrations. these results suggest that therapeutic doses of  xxxd3564xxx  and carbamazepine enhance monoamine turnover, while supratherapeutic doses of  xxxd3564xxx  and carbamazepine inhibit monoamine turnover. those effects of  xxxd3564xxx  and carbamazepine on monoamine metabolism are at least partly involved in the mechanisms of action of  xxxd3564xxx  and carbamazepine.
