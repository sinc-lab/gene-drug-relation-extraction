abstract
platelets are implicated in the pathogenesis of various chronic diseases including cancer. the main objective of the present
study was to determine if dietary fish oil and  xxxd2969xxx , known modulators of colon tumorigenesis, effect transforming growth
factor (tgf)-betas and cyclooxygenase (cox) isozymes in the platelets of colon tumor-bearing male f344 rats. tgf-betas and
coxs are important in the development of chronic illnesses including colon cancer. animals harboring preneoplastic colonic
lesions were randomly allocated to a low fat diet (5% by weight – low corn oil, lfc) and three high fat diets (23% by weight
– high corn oil, hfc; high corn oil containing 150-ppm  xxxd2969xxx , hfc+p; and high fish oil, hff) for 16 weeks.  xxxg2269xxx ,
tgf-beta2, cox-1 and cox-2 protein levels were assessed in the platelets by western blot analysis. active  xxxg2269xxx  (12.5 kda)
level was significantly lower in the platelets of the hfc+p group (p < 0.001), whereas precursor  xxxg2269xxx  (39 kda) level was
significantly lower in the platelets of the hff group (p < 0.001). the anti-rabbit tgf-beta2 polyclonal antibody did not detect
the 13-kda active tgf-beta2 protein in the platelets. however a 29-kda protein, potentially a precursor of tgf-beta2, was detected
in the platelets of all the groups and was significantly lower in the hfc+p and hff groups than in lfc and hfc (p < 0.001).
cox-1 level was significantly lower in the hff group than the other three groups (p < 0.001). cox-2 protein was detected in
the platelets of all diet groups.  xxxd2969xxx  in the presence of high corn oil (hfc+p) significantly lowered the level of cox-2
(p < 0.001), without having any effect on cox-1 level. these findings conclusively show that lfc and hfc differ from hff
and hfc+p, and  xxxd2969xxx  differs from fish oil, in regulating the levels of tgf-betas and cox in the platelets. this supports the
conjecture that the levels of bioactive constituents of the platelets are profoundly modulated by dietary lipids, which in turn
could influence the pathogenesis of chronic illnesses. (mol cell biochem 231: 139–146, 2002)

introduction
the role of growth factors and cyclooxygenase (cox) isozymes in the genesis of a variety of cancers has received a
great deal of attention [1–4]. autocrine regulation of growth
factor production by tumor cells may bestow a growth ad-

vantage in vivo, whereas cells in the vicinity of the tumors
may elicit or contribute to signalling events specific to tumorigenesis. in this regard platelets and cells in circulation
provide growth factors and signalling metabolites at the site
of inflammation or proliferating tissues [1, 5, 6], affecting the
pathogenesis of cancer, diabetes and heart disease [7–9].

platelets are physiologically active and are profoundly affected by diet [10, 11]. humans or animals given a high fish
oil diet have lower platelet aggregation and therefore a higher
bleeding time [12]. in these situations it has been observed
that dietary lipids modulate platelet membrane composition and a number of enzymes involved in production of
eicosanoids from phospholipids [13]. considering that platelets are a reservoir for a number of growth factors and important enzymes, diet should affect growth factor status and
enzymes in the platelets.
the level of tgf-beta is 40–100 fold higher in platelets than
in other non-neoplastic tissues [14]. tgf-betas constitute a
closely related homologous superfamily of proteins, and are
associated with numerous cellular and physiological functions [15, 16]. the active  xxxg2269xxx  is derived from high molecular weight inactive protein complexes [17–19], the
proteolysis of which depends on the site of action and the
physiological need. their role in chronic illnesses has been
studied earlier [20] and several differences in the biological
potencies of the tgf-beta isoforms have been noted. generally,
 xxxg2269xxx  has been regarded as a negative growth factor for
epithelial cells [21]. progressive loss of responsiveness to
 xxxg2269xxx  is commonly seen during carcinogenesis, and under
these circumstances  xxxg2269xxx  may become a tumor promoter
by stimulating angiogenesis, causing immunosuppression
and encouraging the growth of extracellular matrix providing an environment conducive to tumor growth [22–24].
platelets metabolize aa to pg-h2 through the cox system and then pg-h2 is converted to thromboxane (tx)-a2,
leading to the release of pro-inflammatory metabolites during platelet aggregation. the cox pathway, generally consisting of two isozymes (cox-1 and -2), is implicated in a
number of important responses similar to tgf-betas, including
angiogenesis, immune suppression and inflammation [25].
the coxs catalyze the conversion of  xxxd208xxx  (aa)
to various prostanoids [26]. classically, cox-1 has been
considered the constitutive isoforms responsible for maintaining basal levels of eicosanoids and cox-2 is considered
exclusively as an inducible isoforms triggered by inflammatory responses. studies in our lab (unpublished observations)
and by others [27–29] have shown that cox-1 is inducible
and cox-2 is constitutively expressed in certain tissues. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are a class of
drugs known to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic
effects through the inhibition of cox activity, by either altering cox gene or protein expression [30].  xxxd2969xxx  is one
such nsaid inhibiting cox expression [31]. controversy
prevails with respect to presence or role of cox-2 in the
platelets. some authors report that human platelets lack cox2 protein [32, 33], whereas others suggest a basal protein
expression of cox-2 in the platelets of healthy human
subjects [34]. further more, saeed et al. [35] reported that

 xxxd2727xxx , a cox-2 inhibitor, inhibited adrenaline-induced
human platelet aggregation and platelet tx-a2 production,
suggesting the role of cox-2 in the platelets. nsaids and
dietary lipids varying in fatty acid composition modulate the
metabolism of  xxxd208xxx  and/or affect the activities of
cox; whether they regulate protein levels of platelet cox
requires investigation.
platelets are non-nucleated. hence the levels of various
growth factors and enzymes in vivo depend on the modulation of gene expression during their development from
megakaryocytes, which in turn could be influenced by a
number of nutrients including dietary lipids. recently we
demonstrated that dietary lipids modulated the ability of
platelet lysates to stimulate or inhibit the growth of ccl-64
mink lung cells [10]. in addition we showed that dietary lipids
affected  xxxg2269xxx  levels in sprague-dawley male rats [10].
these findings provided the basis for the present study in
which we investigated the effect of dietary lipids varying in
fatty acid composition and the effect of  xxxd2969xxx , a known
inhibitor of cox, on levels of tgf-beta isoforms and cox
isozymes in platelets during experimental colon carcinogenesis. we report that a high fish oil diet, a rich source of long
chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx , differed from that of a high corn oil diet,
a rich source of 18:2:n-6  xxxd2154xxx , in its ability to modulate the levels of coxs and tgf-beta isoforms. in addition we
document that  xxxd2969xxx , an inhibitor of cox, significantly
differed from fish oil in exerting its effect on platelet cox
and tgf-beta levels and its ability to reduce platelet cox-2 protein expression.

materials and methods
animals
weanling male f344 rats, purchased from charles river
breeding laboratories (montreal, canada) were housed in a
climate-controlled room with 12 h light/12 h dark cycle in
stainless steel cages with wire mesh bottoms. temperature
and relative humidity were maintained at 22°c and 55% respectively. animals were fed ad libitum. the food cups were
replenished everyday. all animals were cared for according
to the guidelines of the canadian council on animal care.

study design, diet and treatments
a summary of the protocol is detailed in fig. 1. briefly animals were acclimatized for 2 weeks and then were initiated
with azoxymethane (aom), a colon cancer specific carcinogen (15 mg/kg dissolved in 0.9% saline). after 2 weeks, all
aom-injected rats were fed with a low fat corn oil (lfc, 5%

analysis of fatty acid compositions of diets
the lipids were extracted by the methods of folch et al. [37]
using chloroform/methanol (2:1, vol/vol). the lipid fractions
were directly transmethylated with 6%  xxxd3258xxx  in ethanol for 2 h at 80°c in the presence of heptadecanoic acid
(17:0) as internal standard. following incubation, the reaction mixture was cooled and diluted with 1 ml water and 2 ml
petroleum ether. the upper phase containing the fatty acid
methyl esters was removed, dried under pure nitrogen, reconstituted in small volumes of hexane and were analysed
by gas-liquid chromatography (varian starr 3400; varian instruments, palo alto, ca, usa) using a fused omega wax
capillary column (30 × 0.25 µm) held at 160°c for 1 min,
ramped to 220°c at 2°c per min, and held for 20 min using
helium as the carrier gas.

by weight) diet for 10 weeks. at week 10, the experimental
rats were randomly assigned to one of the following four
diets: high fat corn oil (hfc), high fat fish oil (hff), high
fat corn oil with  xxxd2969xxx  (hfc+p), and low fat corn oil
(lfc). all high fat diets contained (by weight) 18% experimental fat and 5% corn oil, while the low fat diet contained
only 5% corn oil. hfc+p diet was supplemented with 150 ppm
of  xxxd2969xxx . animals remained on the experimental diets for
sixteen weeks. all experimental diets were powder form,
based on ain-76a semi-synthetic diet [36] as shown in table 1. the fatty acid composition of the experimental diets is
presented in table 2. stocks of corn oil (bestfoods canada
inc., toronto, on, canada) along with the prepared powder
diets were stored at 4°c. fish oil stock (gifted by zapata
protein inc., reedville, va, usa) was stored at –20°c in
amber bottles and the fish oil diet was prepared fresh on a
daily basis. body weights of all animals were noted before
the experimental diets were administered and prior to termination.

isolation of plasma and platelets
all animals were killed by co2 asphyxiation. blood was
drawn from a heart puncture using a multiple sample luer
adapter into a vacutainer (becton dickinson vacutainer systems, franklin lakes, nj, usa). 3.2 ml of acid citrate dextrose (acd) was added immediately to these tubes. blood
was transferred to 50 ml conical bottom polypropylene tubes
and 25% of total volume of 0.9% nacl was added. samples
were centrifuged at 300 × g for 20 min at 19°c. the upper
platelet-rich plasma layer was centrifuged further at 800 × g
for 15 min at 19°c, the supernatant was discarded and the
pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline
(pbs) and 1 ml acd. samples were centrifuged at 800 × g
for 15 min at 19°c. supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml 1 x pbs and 1 unit each of
leupeptin, pepstatin and aprotinin protease inhibitors, before
being stored in siliconized eppendorfs at –80°c [38].

results
western blot analysis
body weights
volumes of platelet lysates containing 25 or 40 µg of protein
(for coxs or tgf-betas respectively) were heated for 3 min at
90°c with 6 x 2% (wt/vol) sds buffer, containing 5% (vol/
vol) beta- xxxd26xxx , 10% (vol/vol) glycerin, 0.001% (wt/
vol) bromophenol blue and 63 mm/l tris-hcl (ph 6.8); and
subjected to sds-page (10% gels for coxs and 15% gels
for tgf-betas). a low molecular weight prestained protein ladder (life technologies inc., gaithersburg, md, usa) was
used as standard to assess the molecular weight of the
immunodetection bands. the separated proteins were transferred to hybond ecl nitrocellulose membranes (amersham
life sciences, arlinton heights, il, usa) for 2 h at room
temperature. nitrocellulose blots were incubated overnight
at 4°c with primary antibodies. rabbit anti- xxxg2269xxx  and -beta2
(dilution 1:100; cat. #sc-146 and #sc-90 respectively; santa
cruz biotechnology inc., santa cruz, ca, usa), mouse anticox-1 and rabbit anti-cox-2 (dilution 1:1000; cat. #160110
and #160106 respectively; cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi,
usa) were used as primary antibodies. blots were washed and
incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000; santa cruz biotechnology inc., santa
cruz, ca, usa) for 1 h. the blots were incubated with ecl
reagents (amersham life sciences, arlinton heights, il,
usa) for 1 min and the immunoreactivity was visualized by
exposing an x-ray film (biomax ml film, cat. #r186018,
eastman kodak company, new haven, ct, usa) for 15 min
at room temperature. densitometric analysis was conducted
on visible protein bands using scion image for windows
software.

protein analysis
protein concentrations in the platelet samples were quantified using a coomassie protein assay reagent (pierce, il,
usa) by a microassay modification of the bradford method

the body weights of the animals were modulated by the
dietary regimens. the mean weights were in the order of
hfc+p>hff>hfc>lfc at the final termination (table 3).
the animals fed high fat diets weighed more than those fed
with the low fat corn oil diet, however there were no significant changes in the weights between any of the groups.
 xxxg2269xxx /2 protein levels in platelets
western immunoblotting was conducted to assess if dietary
lipids modulate the protein expression of  xxxg2269xxx , -beta2, cox1 and -2 in the platelet lysates. in the case of  xxxg2269xxx , we
observed and quantified two major immunoreactive bands,
a 12.5-kda band representing the  xxxg2269xxx  active form and a
39-kda band representing the  xxxg2269xxx  precursor (fig. 2a) in
all groups. the platelets of the hfc+p group had significantly
lower levels of  xxxg2269xxx  (p < 0.001) compared to the levels
in the platelets of the lfc, hfc and hff groups. among the
latter three groups, there was no significant difference in
12.5 kda  xxxg2269xxx  levels (table 4). a significantly lower level
(p < 0.001) of the anti-rabbit  xxxg2269xxx  polyclonal antibody reactive 39-kda protein was observed in the platelets of the
hff group than the other groups, (fig. 2a, table 4). how-

resulted in a significantly lower platelet cox-2 protein level
(p < 0.001) than in the hfc or hff groups and was similar

the 12.5 kda represents the active  xxxg2269xxx ; (b) tgf-beta2 antibody cross reacting with a 39 kda protein.

ever, no significant difference between the lfc, hfc and
hfc+p groups were observed. the anti-rabbit tgf-beta2 polyclonal antibody (cat. #sc-90, santa cruz biotecnology, inc.,
santa cruz, ca, usa) detected one major protein band at
29 kda in all the groups, which may represent a precursor of
tgf-beta2 (fig. 2b). however, active tgf-beta2 characterised by
a 13-kda-protein band was not detectable in the platelets of
any diet group. analysis for differences of the 29-kda protein in platelets among the diet groups revealed significantly
lower levels in the hff and hfc+p groups (p < 0.001) compared to the lfc and hfc groups (table 4).

cox-1/2 protein levels in platelets
cox-1 and -2 were identified as 70 and 72 kda protein
bands, respectively, in the platelets of all diet groups (figs
3a and 3b). a significantly lower level (p < 0.001) of cox1 enzyme was observed in the platelet lysate of the hff group
than other groups (table 5).  xxxd2969xxx  treatment (hfc+p)

the present study investigated the effect of fish oil, corn oil
and corn oil supplemented with  xxxd2969xxx  on the protein
expression of tgf-betas and cox enzymes in rat platelets. all
rats had pre-neoplastic lesions and tumors in their colon [40,
41]. the four diet groups represented different lipid environment, each diet containing 5% corn oil by weight. the high
fat diets contained additional fat (18% corn or fish oil by
weight) at the expense of isocaloric amount of carbohydrate
(table 1). the high fish oil diet (hff) differs from the high
corn oil diet (hfc) by having lower levels of linoleic acid
(18:2n-6) and the presence of  xxxd2318xxx  (20:5n3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3). hff diet is well
known for its antithrombotic effect by lowering the production of tx-a2 from aa [42]. the 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 fatty
acids, components of fish oil are known to inhibit cox-1/2
activities and effect 20:4n-6 fatty acid metabolism [43, 44].
 xxxd2969xxx , an inhibitor of both cox-1 and -2, was supplemented in the hfc diet and served as a positive control to
determine if any effect of fish oil could be attributed to its
ability to inhibit the cox enzymes.
western blot analyses of  xxxg2269xxx  and -beta2 demonstrated the
presence of high molecular weight proteins (39 and 29 kda
respectively) and active  xxxg2269xxx  protein (12.5 kda) in the
platelets irrespective of the diets. the test diets affected the
protein level of active  xxxg2269xxx  in the platelets. the piroxicamtreated group had significantly lower levels (p < 0.001) of

active  xxxg2269xxx  (12.5 kda) and the 29 kda tgf-beta2 protein
compared to the lfc, hfc or hff groups. there was no
significant difference in the platelet  xxxg2269xxx  (12.5 kda) protein levels between the latter three groups, a similar trend
observed in our previous study with non-injected rats [10].
these findings represent a complex picture on the influence
of specific diets on platelet biochemistry and suggest that
diets could influence platelet tgf-beta status while in circulation. for instance, the lower level of active  xxxg2269xxx  in the
hfc+p group could not be attributed to the presence of lower
level of precursor protein (39 kda). this effect could be due
to the fact that  xxxd2969xxx  accelerated the release of  xxxg2269xxx 
from the platelets or inhibited the release of active  xxxg2269xxx 
from the precursor protein. in contrast in the hff group, the
active  xxxg2269xxx  was highest among the groups with lowest levels of precursor proteins. one plausible explanation for this
is that the active  xxxg2269xxx  was released from high molecular
weight proteins at a higher rate in the hff group than in the
other groups. the 29-kda protein, which was detected by the
anti-rabbit tgf-beta2 polyclonal antibody, was significantly
lower in the hff and hfc+p groups compared to the other
groups. this can be interpreted in two ways. first, hff and
hfc+p may have down regulated the tgf-beta2 gene expression in the megakaryocytes, consequently resulting in lower
levels of proteins. second, these diets may be affecting the
processing of the precursor protein into active tgf-beta2 and
its release into the circulation, an explanation similar to that
presented for  xxxg2269xxx . tgf-beta exists in a number of isoforms
and the synthesis and potencies of these isoforms may differ
depending on their target tissues. as stated previously,  xxxg2269xxx  is known to exert multiple biological effects including
growth stimulation and inhibition depending on the biological state of the tissue [21, 22].
only a few studies have investigated the level of cox
isoforms in rat platelets using western blot analyses. we report here platelet cox-1 and -2 protein expression in all the
diet groups represented by 70 and 72 kda protein bands respectively (fig. 3). there is controversy on the presence of
cox-2 in platelets [32–35]. the present study demonstrates
that rat platelets indeed have basal levels of cox-2 protein.
the anti-rabbit cox-2 polyclonal antibody (cat. #160106,

cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi, usa) used in this study
was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acid
567–599 of the human cox-2. cox-2 has been designated
as being inducible, whereas cox-1 is constitutive. our findings show that rat platelets express both cox-1 and -2 proteins and can be induced or inhibited by external stimuli such
as dietary intervention. thus, the present study confirms the
constitutive expression of cox-2 [28, 29, 43]. fish oil in the
diet lowered both cox-1 and –2 protein levels in the platelets, with the ability to lower cox-1 being noteworthy because cox-1 is known to express constitutively in most
tissues, is inducible in the platelets, supporting previous findings [32].  xxxd2969xxx  and fish oil are known to inhibit the
activities of cox-1 and -2 [31, 43]. interestingly, in the presence of corn oil, rich in 18:2n-6  xxxd2154xxx ,  xxxd2969xxx  lowered the level of cox-2 but not cox-1. this suggests that
 xxxd2969xxx  is capable of specifically affecting cox-2 even
in the presence of a high level of 18:2n-6  xxxd2154xxx . it is
important to establish if these diets affect transcriptional activities of cox genes in megakaryocytes.
all animals in this study were treated with a colon specific
carcinogen (aom). twenty-four weeks earlier and all animals had preneoplastic lesions or tumors in their colon. the
effect of dietary lipids and  xxxd2969xxx  on the tgf-beta and cox
status was evident in all the animals regardless of the presence of tumors. the tumor outcome and incidence were
modulated by the dietary treatments and have been reported
elsewhere [40]. since rat platelet turnover is in 5–7 days, the
observed effect of diet in platelet tgf-beta and cox status reflects changes due to nutritional state exerted over this 5–7
days period. we had earlier published the effect of dietary
lipids on platelet tgf-beta status in normal sprague-dawley
rats [10]. there were no significant differences in the levels
of platelet  xxxg2269xxx  (12.5 kda) protein between rats fed a high
fat corn oil diet or rats fed a high fat fish oil diet, similar to
the results of the present study. this provides a strong basis
of the dietary influence rather than carcinogen injection or
the presence of tumors on the platelet growth factor status.
both, dietary fish oil and  xxxd2969xxx  supplement in a high fat
corn oil diet are known inhibitors of colon cancer [41, 45, 46].
changes in the platelet tgf-beta and cox status affected by
fish oil and  xxxd2969xxx  treatment reflect three mechanisms by
which they could influence the pathogenesis of colon cancer. first, diets and drugs modulate gene expression of signalling molecules in megakaryocytes or protein synthesis of
these signalling molecules in platelets, thus affecting actual
protein levels released at the site of pathogenesis (colonic
tumors). second, diets and drugs influence the post-translational changes or turnover rate of active signalling peptides
from their precursors in the platelets affecting their modulating potential on tumorigenesis, as seen in the case of tgfbetas. finally, diets and drugs affect the rapid release of such
bio-constituents from the platelets at the site of tumorigen-

esis. specific in vitro studies, directed towards isolated platelets, addressing these mechanisms are warranted. our findings that dietary lipids and specifically  xxxd2969xxx  in the
presence of a high corn oil diet affected tgf-betas and cox
are important and intriguing. the overall effect of fish oil in
reducing the levels of platelet cox isozymes could be attributed to the presence of n-3  xxxd2154xxx , which are known to
downregulate the cox system in chronic illnesses including
colon cancer [44–46]. whether n-6 or n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and selective cox-2 inhibitors exert these effects directly on gene
expression during the development of platelets require further investigation. our findings add conclusive evidence to
support the concept that the biochemical state of platelets are
profoundly affected by diets and drugs and could be involved
in the pathogenesis of chronic illnesses.
