between mbr and steroid biosynthesis(24-26). the present
studies also concentrated on using these two cell lines to
compare results of two steroidogenic systems which respond

benzodiazepine antagonism of hormone-actiuated steroidogenesis
it has been well documented that hormones like acth and
gonadotropins induce a specific proteinaceous factor in steroidogenic cells which is responsible for increasing intramitochondrial cholesterol transport. the generation of this active component is rapid and blocked by cycloheximide(4,17).
extensive research has been devoted to identify this factor
but its identity remains elusive. from the studies reported
here, and asalluded to in the preceding paragraph, it appears
likely that this factor may act through the same mechanism
in which mbr participate as evidenced by the finding that
flunitrazepam inhibits intramitochondrial cholesterol transport activated by tropic hormones.
one candidate proposed to be this factor is dbi (39, 40).
this polypeptide was first characterized for its ability to
displace benzodiazepines from y- xxxd2177xxx  receptors
in the brain and to inhibit y- xxxd2177xxx -activated
chloride channel opening (41). later dbi was found to displace ligands from mbr (42) and to be highly expressed in
steroidogenic cells showing a tissue distribution resembling
that of mbr (43-45). recent studies at this institute demonstrated that flunitrazepam antagonizes the stimulatory action of purified dbi on pregnenolone formation in y-1 mitochondrial preparations? thesefindings uphold the possibility
that dbi, or its processing products (46), may be a mediator
of hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis. this prospect offers
an attractive hypothesis to further investigate and elucidate
the cellular and molecular mechanisms triggering intramitochondrial cholesterol transport.
