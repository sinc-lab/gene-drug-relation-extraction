effect of  xxxd2744xxx  and cimetidine on  xxxd324xxx -stimulated gastric secretion of normal subjects: comparison of effects on acid, water, and pepsin.  the effect of  xxxd2744xxx , a new histamine  xxxg1079xxx  antagonist, on gastric secretory function of eight normal subjects stimulated with  xxxd324xxx , was compared with that of cimetidine. single oral doses of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg  xxxd2744xxx , 300 mg cimetidine, and a placebo were administered on separate occasions 1 h before  xxxd324xxx  stimulation. gastric secretions were recovered in 15-min fractions for the ensuing 2 h, and the ph, h+ concentration and output, volume, and pepsin concentration and output were determined. doses of 150 mg and 300 mg  xxxd2744xxx  depressed the secretory response significantly more than did cimetidine. the antisecretory effects of 75 mg  xxxd2744xxx  was no different than that of 300 mg cimetidine.  xxxd2744xxx  300 mg inhibited pepsin output significantly more than volume. although pepsin concentration was reduced more than volume, the difference was not significant. these observations, in contrast to results of previous studies, suggest a direct inhibition of pepsin secretion, although to a lesser extent than that of acid.
