a complex dynamic ultradian rhythm underlies the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (hpa) circadian rhythm. we have investigated in
normal human male subjects the importance, site of action, and receptor-mediated processes involved in rapid basal corticosteroid
feedback and its interaction with  xxxd1752xxx  releasing hormone (crh) drive.  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc), acth, and cortisol
were measured every 10 min from healthy males during the awakening period or late afternoon using an automated blood sampling
system. mathematical modeling into discrete pulses of activity revealed that intravenous infusion of the synthetic mixed glucocorticoid/
mineralocorticoid agonist prednisolone produced rapid inhibition of acth and cortisol pulsatility within 30 min in the morning and
afternoon. any pulse that had commenced at the time of injection was unaffected, and subsequent pulsatility was inhibited. prednisolone
also inhibited acth and cortisol secretion in response to exogenous crh stimulation, inferring rapid feedback inhibition at the anterior
pituitary. circulating pomc peptide concentrations were unaffected, suggesting that the rapid corticosteroid inhibitory effect specifically
targeted acth secretion from pituitary corticotrophs. prednisolone fast feedback was only reduced by  xxxg1601xxx  antagonist pretreatment and not by  xxxg1602xxx  antagonism, suggesting a  xxxg1601xxx -mediated pathway. the
intravenous prednisolone suppression test provides a powerful new tool to investigate hpa abnormalities underlying metabolic and
psychiatric disease states.

introduction
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (hpa) axis is characterized
by a circadian rhythm, underpinned by a dynamic ultradian
rhythm comprising discrete pulses of acth and glucocorticoid
secretion (carnes et al., 1989; windle et al., 1998). hpa activity is
tightly controlled via complex regulatory mechanisms of glucocorticoid negative feedback involving signaling networks at the
pituitary, hypothalamus, and hippocampus (watts, 2005). the
underlying hpa control mechanism of endogenous cortisol
feedback inhibition was first discovered by moore and price
(1932). although the basic tenet remains, there is new evidence
that ultradian rhythmicity itself is attributable to an oscillatory

feedforward–feedback relationship between the pituitary and adrenal gland (walker et al., 2010). the feedback components of
the hpa axis are assumed to act on the two basic processes of
peptide synthesis and release (watts, 2005), mediated via
genomic processes through  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) and
 xxxg1602xxx  (mr) activation (de kloet et al.,
1998). this simple paradigm is probably an oversimplification. it
cannot account for multiple sites of action or differential glucocorticoid effects during different physiological conditions and
disease states, including depression and the metabolic syndrome
(maddock and pariante, 2001; pariante and miller, 2001). indeed, there is increasing evidence for nongenomic mechanisms
of negative feedback, although differentiation from genomic processes remains controversial (haller et al., 2008).
glucocorticoids have been shown to act in rapid nongenomic
time domains (fast feedback) (dallman and yates, 1969). this
has been well documented in rats (dallman and yates, 1969;
keller-wood and dallman, 1984; atkinson et al., 2008), and,
although there is evidence suggesting a similar mechanism in
man (fehm et al., 1979), it has not been investigated in detail.
these rapid effects are important for physiological responses to

pulsatile glucocorticoid secretion (stavreva et al., 2009) and may
help regulate its characteristic ultradian rhythmicity (atkinson et
al., 2008) via feedforward–feedback loops (jacobson, 2005;
walker et al., 2010).
previous studies on negative feedback in humans have predominately used the potent glucocorticoid agonist dexamethasone to inhibit hpa activity over long time domains and have
been used in the investigation of affective disorders or cushing’s
disease (schmider et al., 1995; deuschle et al., 1998; castro et al.,
2003; grossmann et al., 2004). these studies do not reflect feedback from endogenous pulses of cortisol, which act in a faster
time domain and activate both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors.
to allow us to determine the dynamics of feedback, we used
our human automated blood sampling system (habs) (henley
et al., 2009) that can painlessly and accurately take frequent venous blood samples for measurement of ultradian hormone secretion under basal conditions. this allowed us to capture rapid
inhibition of acth and cortisol secretion after intravenous administration of prednisolone. we chose to use the synthetic corticosteroid prednisolone because it has mr and gr binding and
activating characteristics similar to cortisol (grossmann et al.,
2004). used together, the habs and prednisolone suppression
test have allowed, for the first time, the study in healthy males of
the characteristics of inhibitory glucocorticoid responses within a
rapid time domain, their site and mechanism of action, and importance of endogenous hypothalamic drive.

materials and methods
participants
a total of 36 healthy male volunteers (aged 18 –34 years, mean of 22
years) were recruited from the students and staff of the university of
bristol (bristol, uk). exclusion criteria included (1) body mass index
⬍18 or ⬎30 kg/m 2; (2) medications (including inhalers and steroid
creams) except the occasional paracetamol or aspirin in the last 2
months; (3) a history of anxiety, depression, or psychosis; (4) a history of
psychosis in a first-degree relative; and (5) allergic reaction or contraindication to any of the study medications used.
this research was conducted in accordance with the helsinki principles: all participants gave informed written consent before their
participation in the study. the study had full ethical approval from
the bath research ethics committee and approval by the institutional
review boards of the university hospitals of bristol and the university of bristol. in addition, the study was discussed with the medicines
and healthcare products regulatory authority and formal approval
was deemed unnecessary.

blood sampling and processing
participants were cannulated twice, once in each vein of the antecubital fossa. one cannula was used for collection of venous blood via
our habs described previously by henley et al. (2009) and the other
for the administration of the study reagents. the habs allows a venous blood sample (3 ml) to be drawn  xxxd1891xxx  min intervals via an
automated computerized pump. blood samples were taken for
acth, cortisol,  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc), and prednisolone
levels into edta, serum separator tube ii, and lithium– heparin tubes
and separated within 30 min. samples for acth and pomc were
kept on ice until separation. plasma was divided into aliquots for the
different assays and stored at ⫺80°c until analysis.

assays
cortisol levels were determined by ria (netria): assay sensitivity, 5
nmol/l; intra-assay coefficient of variation (cv), 5.8%; interassay cv,
9.2%; and cross reactivity with prednisolone, 6% (cortisol ria kit
im1841; immunotech). samples were assayed in duplicate. acth levels
were processed via chemiluminescent immunometric assay using the
immulite 2000 acth kit (pichler et al., 2004; raff, 2008): sensitivity, 5

j. neurosci., april 28, 2010 • 30(17):6106 – 6115 • 6107

pg/ml; intra-assay cv, 6.7%; and interassay cv, 8.2%. samples were
analyzed singly. very low acth values after prednisolone were documented as ⬍5 pg/ml by the analyzer, so for deconvolution analysis, the
lower end of the acth curve was further calibrated using a polynomial
trend line and the equation produced used to deduce acth concentration from the counts per second.
prednisolone levels (combination of two 10-min samples) were measured via hplc by the department of clinical biochemistry, royal
brompton hospital (london, uk) (robinson et al., 2003). at the prednisolone concentrations being measured, the cv was 3.4%. the minimum detection limit for the hplc was 20 nmol/l.
pomc levels were performed using a two-site monoclonal antibodybased elisa (rousseau et al., 2007). this had a 100% cross-reactivity for
pomc and pro-acth with a lower limit of detection of 5 pmol/l and an
interassay and intra-assay cv of ⬍10%.

drugs
prednisolone sodium succinate (soludecortin h) was obtained from
merck, and ovine  xxxd1752xxx  releasing hormone (ocrh) was from
ferring pharmaceuticals and prepared according to the instructions of
the manufacturer. all drugs were prepared immediately before administration. prednisolone sodium succinate is the water-soluble form of
prednisolone, and cleavage of the ester occurs very rapidly after intravenous injection; free prednisolone levels can be measured 5 min after the
injection (rose et al., 1981; boudinot and jusko, 1986). for the mechanistic studies, mifepristone was purchased from exelgyn, and spironolactone (nonproprietary) was from alpharma.

experimental protocol
in all studies, six participants attended twice in a blinded randomized
order, once for an injection of 10 mg of prednisolone sodium succinate
(equivalent to 7.5 mg of prednisolone) over 5 min and the other for an
injection of placebo (equal volume of normal saline) over 5 min. during
all testing schedules, the participant was in a separate room to the habs.
the lines connected to the habs and the line used to deliver the prednisolone, placebo, or other intravenous study medications was passed
through a small hatch in the wall above the bed/chair of the participant.
if a participant wanted to be disconnected from the habs to go to the
bathroom, this was done between blood samples. during the daytime,
participants were free to read, do university work, watch dvds, etc., and
could chose to sit on either a chair or a bed.
experiment 1: prednisolone-induced feedback inhibition in the early
morning. participants attended the joint clinical research unit (jcru)
(university hospitals of bristol, bristol, uk)  xxxd1891xxx :00 p.m. on the night of
testing and cannulated twice. a 30 min habs acclimatization sequence
was performed before lights off at 11:00 p.m. a repeat acclimatization
sequence was performed at 4:30 a.m. to ensure that the cannula was still
functioning, and the first blood sample was drawn at 5:00 a.m. ten
minute blood samples for the assay of acth, cortisol, and pomc were
taken throughout the experimental protocol, except for participant h1,
who had 10 min venous blood samples taken for the assay of prednisolone levels instead of pomc to calculate the rate of rise of prednsiolone. because of the volume of blood required for prednsiolone hplc,
it was not possible to collect a simultaneous sample for the assay of
pomc. at 6:02 a.m., participants received 10 mg of prednisolone sodium succinate intravenously or placebo manually over 5 min. lights
switched on  xxxd2274xxx :00 a.m., breakfast was served at 8:00 a.m., and the last
blood sample was taken at 12:00 p.m.
experiment 2: prednisolone-induced feedback inhibition in the afternoon/evening. participants attended the jcru at 2:00 p.m. and cannulated by 2:30 p.m. at 3:00 p.m., a 30 min habs acclimatization sequence
was performed. at 3:30 p.m., the first blood sample was drawn. ten
minute venous blood samples for the assay of acth, cortisol, and
pomc levels were taken throughout the experimental protocol, except
for participant l1, who had 10 min venous blood samples taken for the
assay of prednisolone levels taken instead of pomc as explained in experiment 1. at 4:32 p.m., participants received 10 mg of prednisolone
sodium succinate intravenously or placebo manually over 5 min. dinner
was served  xxxd2274xxx :30 p.m., and the last blood sample was taken  xxxd1891xxx :30 p.m.

experiment 3: level of response of prednisolone-induced feedback inhibition. protocol for experiment 2 was repeated. in addition, participants
received two bolus intravenous injections of ocrh at a dose of 1 ␮g/kg:
crh(1) was given at 4:47 p.m., 10 min after placebo/prednisolone;
crh(2) was given 3 h after crh(1),  xxxd2274xxx :37 p.m.
experiment 4: gr and mr contribution to prednisolone-mediated fast
feedback. participants were divided into three subgroups (placebo, mifepristone, and spironolactone), with six participants per group. according to the subgroup, the following combination of additional study
medications were administered: oral placebo, mifepristone at 600 mg
orally (gr antagonist), or spironolactone at 400 mg orally (mr antagonist). whichever additional study medications the participants received
on their first visit, they also received on their second visit. the order of
study subgroup was randomized in a double-blind manner. participants
attended the jcru at 8:45 a.m. and were cannulated by 9:15 a.m. at
9:30 a.m., a 30 min habs acclimatization sequence was performed and
participants received their study medications.  xxxd1891xxx :00 a.m., the first
blood sample was drawn. ten minute venous blood samples for the assay
of acth and cortisol levels were taken throughout the experimental
protocol. of note, preintervention sampling was extended to 2 h. at
12:02 p.m., participants received 10 mg of prednisolone sodium succinate intravenously or placebo manually over 5 min. lunch was served at
1:00 p.m., and the last blood sample was taken at 5:00 p.m.

statistical analyses

data are presented as means ⫾ se. for all statistical tests, significance at
p ⬍ 0.05 was used. comparison between treatment groups was analyzed
using area under the curve (auc) and all pairwise two-way repeatedmeasures (rm) anova using the holm–sidak method. the complete
10 min data were separated into smaller timeframes. results presented
are for the absolute values (un-normalized) and normalized (average
preintervention activity) data.
acth and cortisol concentration time series were analyzed using a
recently developed automated deconvolution method, which was mathematically verified by direct statistical proof and empirically validated
using hypothalamic–pituitary sampling and simulated pulsatile time series (keenan et al., 2001, 2003). the matlab-based algorithm first
detrends the data and normalizes concentrations to the unit interval [0,1]
(keenan et al., 2005). second, the program creates multiple successive
potential pulse-time sets, each containing one fewer burst via a smoothing process (a nonlinear adaption of the heat-diffusion equation). third,
a maximum-likelihood expectation estimation method computes all secretion and elimination parameters simultaneously conditional on each
of the candidate pulse-time sets. deconvolution parameters comprise basal
secretion (␤0), two half-lives (␣1, ␣2), secretory-burst mass (␩0, ␩1), random
effects on burst mass (␴a), measurement error (␴␧), and a three-parameter
flexible gamma secretory-burst waveform (␤1, ␤2, ␤3). for acth, the fast
half-life was represented  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx .5 min, constituting 37% of the decay amplitude
(iranmanesh et al., 1993). the slow half-life was represented as an unknown
variable between 14 and 35 min. for cortisol, the rapid half-life was fixed at
2.4 min (37% of decay amplitude), and the slow half-life was estimated as a
variable (56 min) within the expected range of 40 – 85 min (bright, 1995). all
candidate pulse-time sets were deconvolved. statistical model selection was
then performed to distinguish among the independently framed fits of the
multiple candidate pulse-time sets using the akaike information criterion
(akaike, 1974). observed interpulse intervals were described by a twoparameter weibull process (more general form of a poisson process, which
uncouples the mean from the variance). the parameters (and units) are
frequency (number of bursts per total sampling period, ␭ of weibull distribution), regularity of interpulse intervals (unitless ␥ of weibull), slow halflife (minutes), basal and pulsatile secretion rates (concentration units/
session), mass secreted per burst (concentration units), and waveform shape
[mode or time delay to maximal secretion after objectively estimated burst
onset (minutes)]. to calculate average pulse mass according to the timeframe of the first 2 h (0 –120 min) and the last 3 h (121–360 min) postintervention start time, pulsatile activity included was based on predicted putative
pulse onset occurring within the allotted timeframe. results presented are
for the absolute values and normalized (average placebo pulse mass used as
surrogate marker for baseline activity for experiments 1–3, baseline prein-

on his first visit (placebo intervention day). stress response exclusion criteria
included a double than or greater difference in preintervention pulse mass
between placebo and prednsiolone subgroups. comparisons within and between treatment groups were analyzed using a two-tailed paired student’s t
test. if there was no detectable activity after intervention, the minimal detectable pulse mass for the program was assigned (1 pg/ml acth and 3 nmol/l
cortisol).
for the participants who received the prednisolone intervention during an interpulse interval, time to inhibition was calculated as the time
taken from the start of prednisolone intervention to the next putative
pulse onset as estimated by deconvolution analysis. evidence of partial
inhibition was taken as ⬍50% of baseline activity and complete inhibition as ⬍30% of baseline activity.
to quantitate the orderliness or regularity of consecutive serum
pomc levels over the sampling period, approximate entropy ( xxxg171xxx )
was used. normalized  xxxg171xxx  parameters of m ⫽ 1 (run length) and r ⫽
20% (tolerance window) of each series sd were used. the distribution of
empirically “random” (maximal)  xxxg171xxx  values were determined by 1000
random shuffles of ordered sample values within each time series. therefore, the  xxxg171xxx  of each “observed” (unshuffled) time series was also evaluated as a mean ratio of observed-to-random  xxxg171xxx  (veldhuis et al.,
2001). higher absolute  xxxg171xxx  values denote greater relative randomness
of hormone secretion pattern (pincus and keefe, 1992).

pulsatile activity was either inhibited (typically ⬍30% by mass) and
appeared delayed or was absent. subjects may or may not have exhibited recovery of endogenous pulsatility by the end of the sampling

was first affected.
if, however, the injection of prednisolone was given during
the interpulse period (fig. 4c), the subsequent pulse occurred at
a time that appeared appropriate but was smaller than expected,
and the degree of inhibition was related to the length of time after
prednisolone and the putative pulse onset time; the greater the
time from prednisolone treatment to pulse onset, the greater the
degree of inhibition. partial inhibition (50% by mass) was first

more than placebo intervention. prednisolone reduced the response to crh(2) more than crh(1) for both acth and cortisol ( p ⬍ 0.05). after placebo, the response to crh(2) was smaller
than crh(1) for acth only ( p ⫽ 0.05) (supplemental table
6 b–d, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).
total pulsatility was significantly reduced in the prednisolone
intervention arm for acth and cortisol ( p ⫽ 0.01 and p ⬍ 0.05
respectively) (supplemental table 6 a, available at www.
jneurosci.org as supplemental material).
on examination of putative pulse onset times, the injection of
ocrh synchronized the subjects by inducing a pulse of activity.
there was evidence of inhibition of acth pulsatile activity in all
subjects within 20 min and for cortisol within 30 min for all but
one subject.
acth basal secretion was reduced after prednisolone ( p ⬍
0.01) (supplemental table 6 a, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material). the acth basal secretion after placebo
and prednisolone in the ocrh studies was not statistically different from the corresponding morning and afternoon studies. for
cortisol, there was a trend toward reduced basal secretion after
prednisolone, and this did not reach significance (supplemental
table 6 a, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental
material).
circulating pomc concentrations
pomc, the precursor of acth, was secreted into the circulation
with concentrations of 5–25 pmol/l (mean of 15 pmol/l) for the
morning studies, 17–100 pmol/l (mean of 63 pmol/l) for the
afternoon studies, and 17–130 pmol/l (mean of 43 pmol/l) for
the ocrh stimulation studies. based on auc assessment, the
pomc levels were significantly lower in the morning compared
with the afternoon ( p ⬍ 0.001, two-tailed unpaired student’s t
test). there was no inhibition of pomc secretion with pred-

nisolone during any timeframe measured,
independent of time of day as assessed by
auc (fig. 7).
interestingly, pomc was not stimulated by ocrh over 180 min and even
after repeated crh stimulation. mean
pomc concentrations were 43 pmol/l after ocrh, which did not differ from placebo concentrations in the afternoon.
to assess whether pomc had any significant pulsatility, the mean absolute
 xxxg171xxx  value was calculated. for pomc,
this was 1.03 ⫾ 0.07 with a ratio (to shuffled) of 1.08 for the morning studies,
1.14 ⫾ 0.07 with a ratio (to shuffled) of
1.20 for the afternoon studies, and 1.12 ⫾
0.06 with a ratio (to shuffled) of 0.91 for
the ocrh-stimulated studies. this indicated that, in all of the studies over the
timeframe measured, the pomc concentration series was ⬃100% toward random, indicating no significant pulsatility.

experiment 4: gr and mr contribution
to prednisolone-mediated fast feedback
pretreatment with spironolactone did
not modify the rapid inhibitory response to prednisolone intervention,
nor were there any significant differences between the spironolactone and
placebo groups within any time domain using rm-anova
(fig. 8). pretreatment with oral placebo was similar to previous
experiments (figs. 1, 2, 8, 9). furthermore, deconvolution analysis revealed a similar rapid pattern of inhibition of acth and
cortisol pulsatility with no statistically significant differences in
normalized average pulse mass according to timeframe between
the prednisolone intervention responses of the spironolactone
and placebo groups. because of a lack of preintervention data, the
placebo intervention results could not be analyzed (supplemental
tables 7 b, c, 8 b, c, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). there were no statistically significant differences seen in acth and cortisol basal secretion compared with
placebo preintervention with a reduction in acth basal secretion ( p ⬍ 0.005) only (supplemental tables 7a, 8 a, available at
www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).
in contrast to the lack of effect with spironolactone, pretreatment
with mifepristone did both reduce and delay the acth inhibition
after prednisolone ( p ⬍ 0.05 normalized, rm-anova). specifically, in the mifepristone group (fig. 9), acute administration of
prednisolone produced a significant decline in acth levels only
after 2 h ( p ⬍ 0.05 absolute; p ⬍ 0.001 normalized, rm-anova)
and after 3 h for cortisol levels ( p ⬍ 0.01 absolute; p ⬍ 0.05
normalized, rm-anova). a similar pattern could be seen for
normalized cortisol data but did not reach statistical significance.
there were no statistically significant differences between normalized acth and cortisol (rm-anova) in those pretreated
with mifepristone and placebo after placebo intervention.
deconvolution analysis confirmed the loss of rapid inhibition
by prednisolone after mifepristone treatment (supplemental tables 7 b, c, 8 b, c, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental
material). prednisolone produced a significant reduction in average acth pulse mass only after 2 h compared with baseline
activity (acth, p ⫽ 0.001 normalized), and no difference was

additionally, mifepristone pretreatment attenuated the reduction seen in basal acth secretion after prednisolone, with

fast feedback was first described in the rat under conditions of
stress by dallman and yates in 1969 and later characterized as
part of a two-phase pattern of inhibition of hpa activity (kellerwood and dallman, 1984). similar studies in man were performed in hypoadrenal patients off replacement therapy who also
showed a similar two-phase period of feedback inhibition (fehm
et al., 1979). the human inhibitory time course shows great variability and has been described as anything between 15 and 60 min
(reader et al., 1982; posener et al., 1997; boscaro et al., 1998).
because of this variability, there has been uncertainty as to
whether the mechanisms underlying the feedback differed from
that in the animal model.
in our studies, we have used the habs (henley et al., 2009) to
enable us to do a full investigation of the patterns of hpa activity
under basal and feedback inhibition conditions. we used prednisolone to induce feedback inhibition because it activates both mr

and gr (grossmann et al., 2004) and allowed us to measure hpa
responses without cross-reactivity with endogenous cortisol.
resolving the acth and cortisol profiles into discrete pulses
of activity by deconvolution analysis revealed very rapid feedback
inhibition. indeed, the pattern of inhibition was identical to the
rodent model (atkinson et al., 2008) in which feedback inhibition
showed a distinct relationship with the phase of the endogenous
ultradian rhythm. we find that any pulse that has commenced at the
time of prednisolone injection was completed, whereas any subsequent pulsatile activity was significantly smaller (⬍30%). if,
however, prednisolone was given during the interpulse period,
subsequent pulsatile activity occurred at an appropriate time but
pulses were smaller than expected. interestingly, the longer the
time after prednisolone to pulse onset, the greater the degree of
inhibition, with partial inhibition (50% of baseline activity) at 8
min and complete inhibition (⬍30% of baseline activity) by
10 –12 min. this rapid inhibition was present for acth and
cortisol and shows for the first time that, in the basal state, humans show rapid hpa negative feedback.
this relationship of feedback response with the phase of the
endogenous ultradian rhythm explains the marked variation in
previously documented speed and duration of feedback inhibition (reader et al., 1982; posener et al., 1997; boscaro et al., 1998).
because pulsatility is not synchronized between subjects and the
interpulse interval for acth is ⬃40 min (veldhuis et al., 1990)
and for cortisol is 80 –110 min (follenius et al., 1987; veldhuis et
al., 1989), prednisolone-induced inhibition may occur from

j. neurosci., april 28, 2010 • 30(17):6106 – 6115 • 6113

minutes to 1 h for acth or up to 2 h for cortisol, emphasizing
the importance of adjuvant methods such as mathematical modeling when examining “noisy” datasets.
it is also interesting to note that, as in the animal model
(atkinson et al., 2008), some of our subjects demonstrated recovery of endogenous cortisol pulsatility after approximately 5 h.
this only occurred in the afternoon, suggesting that, although
rapid inhibition itself was independent of time of day and consequently crh drive, response duration does depend on chronobiology. because this recovery was seen for cortisol rather than
acth, it suggests involvement of a non-acth input such as the
splanchnic nerve (ulrich-lai et al., 2006) or intra-adrenal clock
(son et al., 2008).
deconvolution analysis also revealed that prednisolone resulted in reduced basal secretion of acth. because deconvolution analysis assumes a steady-state basal release, it is not possible
to ascertain whether inhibition of basal, as opposed to pulsatile,
secretion was similarly rapid or a genomically mediated gradual
decline. interestingly, cortisol basal secretion was unaffected.
serial injections of ocrh synchronized pulsatility allowed estimation of rapidity of feedback response to prednisolone in all
participants. inhibition of the crh response occurred within
⬍20 min for acth and typically ⬍30 min for cortisol. complete
inhibition of crh stimulation occurred after the second injection of ocrh 3 h after prednisolone. these observations concur
with animal work (zimmermann and critchlow, 1969, 1972).
this is the first evidence for rapid feedback at the level of the
anterior pituitary gland in man and fits with early in vitro (sayers
and portanova, 1974) and in vivo (jones et al., 1977) studies in the
rat. in the placebo wing of this study, the second ocrh injection
resulted in a blunted response as has been documented previously (young et al., 2004), although basal acth secretion was
unaffected, suggesting an action of crh on the pulsatile mechanism only.
although there is rodent data suggesting that fast feedback
can occur independent of protein synthesis (keller-wood and
dallman, 1984) without modification of pomc processing to
acth (roberts et al., 1982), there is no equivalent data in man.
we addressed this by the measurement of the release of unprocessed pomc for which we found no evidence of pulsatile release,
suggesting that it was not released through the normal regulatory
secretory pathway. pomc levels were higher in the afternoon
than in the morning, which may be a reflection of differential
processing of pomc into acth. circulating pomc was unaffected by either prednisolone or ocrh, further reinforcing the
concept that pomc is released from pituitary corticotrophs by
a constitutive pathway insensitive to corticosteroid feedback
(pritchard and white, 2007). the fast inhibitory feedback of glucocorticoids in man therefore appears to be selective for the regulated release mechanism.
although pretreatment with the mr antagonist spironolactone had no effect on the inhibitory response to prednisolone, the
selected gr antagonist mifepristone resulted in a significant reduction in the inhibition of acth and cortisol levels and pulse
mass. most marked was the fact that, after mifepristone, there was
no significant feedback inhibition from prednisolone for 2 h, and
there was complete inhibition of the prednisolone-induced reduction of acth basal secretion.
the literature on the mechanism of rapid glucocorticoid inhibition of hpa activity is confusing. in the rat, there is in vivo
evidence that this involves an mr-mediated process (atkinson et
al., 2008), whereas ex vivo, high levels of corticosterone (10- to
20-fold higher than binds classical mr) inhibitory responses sug-

6114 • j. neurosci., april 28, 2010 • 30(17):6106 – 6115

gest a less sensitive membrane-bound mr (karst et al., 2005). at
the level of the pituitary in vitro, however, rapid inhibition of
membrane potential (hua and chen, 1989) and acth release
(dayanithi and antoni, 1989; john et al., 2002; buckingham et al.,
2003) occurs via a nongenomic annexin 1-mediated gr mechanism (taylor et al., 1993). our data reveal a response that is more
rapid than demonstrated for annexin 1 and fits better with recent
in vitro and in vivo evidence for rapid corticosteroid processes
acting via a membrane-bound gr (tait et al., 2008; breuner and
orchinik, 2009; roy and rai, 2009), probably mediated through
a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (limbourg et al., 2002;
matthews et al., 2008; roy and rai, 2009). this suggests a fast
feedback inhibition that targets the fusion of acth-containing
vesicles with the cell membrane and their subsequent release
from corticotrophs and explains why the constitutive release of
pomc was unaffected.
it is of course possible that both gr and mr are involved in
negative feedback, with gr effecting a rapid nongenomic feedback
at the level of the anterior pituitary and mr sensing higher glucocorticoid levels while levels are still rising (karst et al., 2005). these could
exert different temporal dynamics and provide a feedback sensor
mechanism with a wide range of sensitivity.
in conclusion, we provide novel evidence that hpa inhibitory
feedback responses to corticosteroids occur within a very rapid
time domain in man. this fast feedback inhibition is gr dependent, independent of crh drive, occurs predominately at the
level of the anterior pituitary, and only blocks the regulated pathway of acth release. our ability to detect these robust rapid
responses of hpa activity to exogenous corticosteroid feedback
in man will allow us to investigate mechanisms underlying abnormal hpa activity in conditions such as depression, obesity,
memory dysfunction, and aging.
