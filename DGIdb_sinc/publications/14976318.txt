cholesterol absorption

dietary cholesterol consumption and intestinal cholesterol absorption contribute
to plasma cholesterol levels, a risk factor for coronary heart disease. the molecular
mechanism of sterol uptake from the lumen of the small intestine is poorly deﬁned.
we show that  xxxg1583xxx  ( xxxg1583xxx ) protein plays a critical role in the
absorption of intestinal cholesterol.  xxxg1583xxx  expression is enriched in the small
intestine and is in the brush border membrane of enterocytes. although otherwise
phenotypically normal,  xxxg1583xxx -deﬁcient mice exhibit a substantial reduction in
absorbed cholesterol, which is unaffected by dietary supplementation of bile acids.
ezetimibe, a drug that inhibits cholesterol absorption, had no effect in  xxxg1583xxx 
knockout mice, suggesting that  xxxg1583xxx  resides in an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway
responsible for intestinal cholesterol absorption.
whole-body cholesterol homeostasis is a highly
regulated balance of de novo synthesis, dietary
cholesterol absorption, and biliary clearance
and excretion. the cholesterol biosynthetic and
clearance pathways are well defined. an understanding of the biosynthetic pathway has led to

mechanisms controlling cholesterol absorption
are less well understood. the adenosine
triphosphate (atp)– binding cassette (abc)
a1 transporter and scavenger receptor type b1
( xxxg2013xxx ) were postulated to play a role in intestinal cholesterol absorption (2–4), but targeted
inactivation of these genes in mice had no effect
on cholesterol uptake (5–7). the abcg5 and
abcg8 transporters, which are defective in the
sterol absorption disease sitosterolemia, provide

away from the transfer pathway directing the
production of cholesteryl esters by acyl-coa
cholesterol acyl transferase 2 (acat2) (8–10).
however, none of these mechanisms appear to
be involved in the initial uptake of cholesterol.
in humans, cholesterol absorption occurs in
the proximal jejunum of the small intestine, where
both dietary cholesterol and biliary cholesterol are
available for uptake from the intestinal lumen. the
second-order kinetics of cholesterol absorption
(11), its sterol specificity (12, 13), and its inhibition by drugs such as ezetimibe (14) all suggest
that this process is mediated by a specific transport
protein(s). however, the identity of this putative
cholesterol transporter has remained elusive.
to identify genes involved in cholesterol
uptake, we used a genomic-bioinformatics approach. because sequences from gastrointestinal tissues are poorly represented in the public
sequence databases, we prepared two cdna
libraries for sequencing, one from rat jejunum
mucosal scrapings and the second from jejunum enterocytes isolated by laser capture microdissection (15). the ⬃16,500 expressed sequence tags (ests) derived from these libraries
were combined with all available public rat
ests and were annotated by cross-referencing
the rat sequences with both mouse and human
data. this sequence database was analyzed for
all transcripts containing features anticipated in
a cholesterol transporter, i.e., sequences predictive of transmembrane domains, extracellular
signal peptides, and n-linked glycosylation
sites as well as known cholesterol interacting
motifs such as sterol-sensing domain (16–18).
only one credible candidate gene emerged from
this analysis: the rat homolog of  xxxg1583xxx  (19).
human  xxxg1583xxx  has several of the predicted
features of a plasma membrane–expressed transporter including a secretion signal, 13 putative

transmembrane domains and extensive potential
n-linked glycosylation sites located within the
extracellular loops of the protein. furthermore,
this protein contains a sterol-sensing domain (fig.
s1), which is present in other key regulators of
cholesterol homeostasis including  xxxg1060xxx  (20), srebp cleavage-activating protein
(scap) (16), patched (21), and niemannpick c1 (npc1) (22).
 xxxg1583xxx  has ⬃50% amino acid homology
to npc1 (19), a gene that is defective in the
cholesterol storage disease niemann-pick type
c (np-c) and functions in intracellular cholesterol trafficking (22). however, in contrast to
npc1 mrna, which is abundantly expressed
and widely distributed in many tissues (23),
 xxxg1583xxx  mrna is expressed at low levels and
is enriched in the gastrointestinal tract. blastn
and e-northern analyses of the rat, mouse, and
human est databases were used to estimate the
abundance and tissue distribution of the
 xxxg1583xxx  mrna (genbank accession numbers
ay437865, ay437866, and ay437867). in
the rat, only 4 of 289,849 available ests—
three of which were from the jejunum libraries
described above— encoded  xxxg1583xxx . in the
mouse, 10 of 2,170,430 ests encoded
 xxxg1583xxx , 6 of which were from intestine, 2
from cecum, and 2 from embryo. the human
est database contained 6  xxxg1583xxx  ests out of
9,274,986 total (2 from pancreas, 2 colon, 1
gallbladder, and 1 fetal liver or spleen).
we assessed  xxxg1583xxx  mrna expression in
15 tissues from rat, mouse, and human using both
quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase
chain reaction (rt-pcr) and microarray hybridization (fig. 1a). northern blot analysis
was inconclusive because of the low levels of
 xxxg1583xxx  mrna and because npc1 mrna
cross-reacted with the labeled probe (24). in all
three species, small intestine showed the highest level of mrna expression. expression in
other tissues including gallbladder, liver, testis,
and stomach was also observed. because cholesterol absorption occurs predominantly in the
duodenum and proximal jejunum, with little
absorption from ileal segments of the intestine
(25, 26), we investigated  xxxg1583xxx  mrna expression along the duodenum-ileum axis. the
levels of  xxxg1583xxx  mrna varied in different
segments of rat intestine, with peak expression in
the proximal jejunum (fig. 1b). comparison of
relative levels of  xxxg1583xxx  protein by western blot
reiterated the distribution pattern seen with the
mrna (fig. 1b). furthermore,  xxxg1583xxx  mrna
and protein expression in the jejunum was confined to the enterocyte, as demonstrated by in situ
hybridization (fig. 2a) and immunohistochemistry (fig. 2b). both techniques revealed discrete
localization of  xxxg1583xxx  to the epithelial layer
bordering the luminal space (arrows) along the
crypt-villus axis. under high magnification,
 xxxg1583xxx  protein expression in the enterocyte was
observed closest to the luminal space (fig. 2b,

small intestine from
the pyloric valve to
the ileacolic valve was
removed, ﬂushed, and
divided into 10 segments of equal length
(⬃10 cm) for puriﬁcation of mucosal mrna
or isolation of epithelial cells (31). equal
amounts of mrna
from each segment
were subjected to
quantitative rt-pcr
(top), and  xxxg1583xxx  signal was normalized
with the enterocytespeciﬁc marker villin.
equal amounts of total protein from each
segment were analyzed by western blot
analysis (bottom).

cytes prepared from discrete segments of the
intestine showed  xxxg1583xxx  expression in enterocytes from the proximal (jejunum) but not in the
distal (ileum) region (fig. 2c). subfractionation of
brush border membranes from proximal enterocytes suggested considerable association with the
apical membrane fraction (fig. 2c).
to investigate the role of  xxxg1583xxx  in cholesterol absorption in vivo, we characterized
 xxxg1583xxx -null (⫺/⫺) mice [produced by deltagen inc. (palo alto, ca)]. embryonic stem
cells derived from the 129/olahsd mouse substrain were used to generate chimeric mice. f1
mice were generated by breeding with
c57bl/6 females, and f2 homozygous (⫺/⫺)
mutant mice were produced by intercrossing f1
heterozygous (⫹/⫺) males and females. both
wild-type (⫹/⫹) and (⫹/⫺) littermates exhibited  xxxg1583xxx  mrna and protein expression in
jejunal enterocytes, whereas (⫺/⫺) mice
showed no detectable  xxxg1583xxx  expression (fig.
3). physical examination of the (⫺/⫺) mice

indicated that  xxxg1583xxx  deletion had no detrimental effect on development, fertility, or any
hematological or plasma parameters. at necropsy, the (⫺/⫺) mice were macroscopically
and histologically normal. intestinal morphology was normal in the (⫺/⫺) mice, with no lipid
accumulation in the enterocytes. no differences
were found in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels among the (⫹/⫹), (⫹/⫺), and (⫺/⫺)
mice (table s1). hepatic lipids were also similar, with the exception of significantly reduced
cholesteryl ester levels in the (⫺/⫺) mice compared to (⫹/⫹) (table s1).
we next compared the uptake of orally administered radiolabeled cholesterol in  xxxg1583xxx 
(⫺/⫺), (⫹/⫺), and age-matched (⫹/⫹) mice
(fig. 4). the fraction of cholesterol absorbed, as
evaluated by the fecal dual isotope technique, was
similar in (⫹/⫹) and (⫹/⫺) mice fed a chow diet
(fig. 4a). the (⫹/⫺) mice absorbed 45 ⫾ 4%
and (⫹/⫹) mice absorbed 51 ⫾ 3% of an oral

(⫺/⫺) mice absorbed only 15.6 ⫾ 0.4% of the
14
c-cholesterol, a 69% reduction in comparison to
(⫹/⫹) mice (p ⬍ 0.001). a similar reduction has
been observed in mice lacking the bile acid synthetic enzymes cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase
(cyp7␣) or  xxxg580xxx  ( xxxg580xxx ) (27,
28); however, dietary supplementation of bile salts
(via  xxxd1685xxx ) restored cholesterol absorption in
these mutant mice to wild-type levels. to determine whether the reduction in cholesterol absorption in the  xxxg1583xxx  (⫺/⫺) mice involved alterations in the bile acid pathway, we measured
cholesterol absorption in mice fed a diet containing 0.1%  xxxd1685xxx  (fig. 4c). as expected from
the bile salt addition to the diet, the fraction of
cholesterol absorbed was increased in cholic acidfed (⫹/⫹) (66.2 ⫾ 3%) and (⫹/⫺) mice (52.5 ⫾
4%) compared with mice fed a chow diet (p ⬍
0.05) (fig. 4, a versus c). in contrast,  xxxd1685xxx 
supplementation of the diet had no effect on
14
c-cholesterol absorption in  xxxg1583xxx  (⫺/⫺)
mice (fig. 4, a versus c), indicating that the
reduced cholesterol absorption observed in these
mice was not caused by an alteration in the bile
acid pathway. the 15% residual cholesterol
absorption remaining in the  xxxg1583xxx  (⫺/⫺)
mice may be the result of a nonspecific adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract or of a minor
uptake mechanism exposed by elimination of
the principal mechanism.
the azetidinone drug, ezetimibe, inhibits the
absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol in
rodents and humans and has recently been approved for cholesterol lowering in patients with
hypercholesterolemia. in (⫹/⫹) mice, ezetimibe

lowered cholesterol absorption by 68 to 73% (fig.
4, b and d). this level of cholesterol absorption
was similar to that seen in  xxxg1583xxx  (⫺/⫺) mice
not treated with ezetimibe (fig. 4a). interestingly,
ezetimibe caused no further reduction in cholesterol absorption in the  xxxg1583xxx  (⫺/⫺) mice (fig.
4, b and d), suggesting that  xxxg1583xxx  plays an
essential role in the ezetimibe-sensitive cholesterol
absorption pathway. efforts to demonstrate direct
binding of ezetimibe to  xxxg1583xxx  using radiolabeled (29) and fluorescent (7, 30) analogs have
not been successful, however.
because ezetimibe inhibits the uptake of cholesterol into enterocytes and its absorption, we
also measured acute intestinal cholesterol uptake
in the  xxxg1583xxx  (⫺/⫺) mice. in this 2-hour assay,
cholesterol absorption was reduced by 86% and
intestinal cholesterol uptake inhibited by 72%,
with substantially more cholesterol remaining in
the lumen of the intestine for excretion in the
(⫺/⫺) mice compared with (⫹/⫹) mice (fig. 4, e
and f). triglyceride absorption was not changed
in the  xxxg1583xxx  (⫺/⫺) mice (table s1). the selective reduction in enterocyte cholesterol uptake
resulted in a compensatory 3.3-fold up-regulation
of the mrna encoding the cholesterol synthesis
enzyme hmg coa synthase in the intestine,
without significantly affecting abcg5 or abcg8
mrna expression (fig. s2). the reduced delivery
of intestinal cholesterol to liver also caused an
up-regulation of hepatic hmg coa synthase
mrna by ⬃3.8-fold (fig. s2), suggesting that
increased hepatic cholesterol synthesis is responsible for the normal plasma cholesterol levels in
these mice (table s1).

these data indicate that  xxxg1583xxx  is critical for the uptake of cholesterol across the
plasma membrane of the intestinal enterocyte. our initial attempts to reconstitute cholesterol transport in nonenterocyte cells by
overexpression of  xxxg1583xxx  have been unsuccessful, suggesting that additional subunits or
cofactors in the jejunal enterocyte may be
required to reconstitute an active cholesterol

transporter. the complete insensitivity of
 xxxg1583xxx -null mice to the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe suggests that
 xxxg1583xxx  or an associated protein may be the
molecular target of this drug.

nervy links  xxxg1836xxx  to
plexin-mediated semaphorin
repulsion
jonathan r. terman and alex l. kolodkin*
cyclic nucleotides regulate axonal responses to a number of guidance cues
through unknown molecular events. we report here that drosophila nervy,
a member of the myeloid translocation gene family of a kinase anchoring
proteins (akaps), regulates repulsive axon guidance by linking the cyclic
 xxxd81xxx  (camp)– dependent protein kinase (pka) to the
semaphorin 1a (sema-1a) receptor plexin a (plexa). nervy and pka antagonize sema-1a-plexa–mediated repulsion, and the akap binding region of
nervy is critical for this effect. thus, nervy couples camp-pka signaling to
plexa to regulate sema-1a–mediated axonal repulsion, revealing a simple
molecular mechanism that allows growing axons to integrate inputs from
multiple guidance cues.
many semaphorin proteins, including the
drosophila transmembrane semaphorin
sema-1a, are axonal repellents that signal

through transmembrane plexin proteins (1).
