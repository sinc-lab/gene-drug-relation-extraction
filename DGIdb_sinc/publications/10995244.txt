abstract:

to investigate the role of tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) in the catalytic mechanism of  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase (nos), we analyzed the spectral changes following addition of oxygen to the reduced oxygenase
domain of  xxxg1579xxx  (nos) in the presence of different pteridines at -30 °c. in
the presence of  xxxd1027xxx  (nohla) and bh4 or 5-methyl-bh4, both of which support no
synthesis, the first observable species were mixtures of high-spin ferric nos (395 nm), ferric no-heme
(439 nm), and the oxyferrous complex (417 nm). with arg, no clear intermediates could be observed
under the same conditions. in the presence of the bh4-competitive  xxxd1350xxx ,8-dihydrobiopterin (bh2),
intermediates with maxima at 417 and 425 nm were formed in the presence of arg and nohla,
respectively. in the presence of 4-amino-bh4, the maxima of the intermediates with arg and nohla
were at 431 and 423 nm, respectively. we ascribe all four spectra to oxyferrous heme complexes. the
intermediates observed in this study slowly decayed to the high-spin ferric state at -30 °c, except for
those formed in the presence of 4-amino-bh4, which required warming to room temperature for
regeneration of high-spin ferric nos; with arg, regeneration remained incomplete. from these observations,
we draw several conclusions. (1) bh4 is required for reductive oxygen activation, probably as a transient
one-electron donor, not only in the reaction with arg but also with nohla; (2) in the absence of redoxactive pterins, reductive oxygen activation does not occur, which results in accumulation of the oxyferrous
complex; (3) the spectral properties of the oxyferrous complex are affected by the presence and identity
of the substrate; (4) the slow and incomplete formation of high-spin ferric heme with 4-amino-bh4 suggests
a structural cause for inhibition of nos activity by this pteridine.

the mechanism by which  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (nos;1
 xxxg1579xxx ) generates no from l-arginine, o2, and
nadph-derived electrons has been the topic of intensive
research (reviewed in refs 1-4). the reaction takes place in
two stages. the first step consumes two electrons and results
in formation of  xxxd1027xxx  (nohla), which is
subsequently oxidized to  xxxd2429xxx  and no in a reaction
requiring one more electron. both reactions consume 1 equiv

of o2. there are structural and mechanistic similarities
between nos and cytochrome p450. in both enzymes,
catalysis takes place at a heme that has thiolate sulfur as a
proximal ligand, and the hydroxylation of arg resembles
mono-oxygenations as catalyzed by cytochrome p450.
consequently, the mechanism of the first step was thought
to be adequately described by the catalytic cycle originally
proposed for cytochrome p450. for the second step, different
mechanisms have been suggested.
unlike cytochrome p450, nos requires tetrahydrobiopterin [(6r)-5,6,7,8- xxxd3166xxx , bh4] as an additional cofactor. the role of bh4 in catalysis has been the
object of numerous studies, but is not yet fully elucidated
(reviewed in refs 3-6). in the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, bh4 is a dissociable cofactor that is involved in
reductive oxygen activation and undergoes two-electron
redox cycling. in nos, bh4 is tightly bound, and there is
no evidence for two-electron redox cycling. bh4 was shown
to stimulate nos dimerization, substrate binding, and the
low-to-high-spin heme transition (7-12), but all of these
phenomena occur to a lesser extent in the absence of bh4
as well, whereas the dependence of no synthesis on bh4
is absolute. since this implies an as yet unidentified function
of bh4, the idea that it plays a redox role in nos catalysis
was never surrendered completely. studies with pterin

analogues offered support for such a role, since tetrahydropterins were shown to sustain no synthesis, whereas redoxinactive dihydropteridines were inhibitory, although they
mimicked the structural and allosteric effects of bh4 (8, 1315).
in a previous low-temperature spectroscopic study, we
demonstrated that bh4 is required for reductive activation
of the oxyferrous complex in the first step of catalysis (16).
in the absence of either arg or bh4, the reaction between
ferrous nos and o2 resulted in formation of an intermediate
with an absorbance maximum at 415/7 nm, as is typical of
cytochrome p450 oxyferrous heme complexes (17-21). only
when arg and bh4 were both present did the reaction exhibit
a blue-shifted intermediate (lambdamax 404/5 nm) that we ascribed
to a higher valency iron oxygen complex. in line with this
interpretation, nohla was formed in a 0.5 per heme
stoichiometry under those conditions. based on those observations, we postulated that bh4 serves as a one-electron
donor to the oxyferrous complex. x-ray crystallographic
evidence in support of one-electron redox cycling of bh4
during nos catalysis has since then been presented (22).
recently, the formation of a bh3• radical during the reaction
of reduced nos with o2 in the presence of arg and bh4
was directly demonstrated with electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectroscopy (23, p. p. schmidt, r. lange, a.
c. f. gorren, b. mayer, and k. k. andersson, unpublished
observations).
our previous study was limited to the effects of arg and
bh4 on the reaction of  xxxg1577xxx  ( xxxg1577xxx ) with o2. here
we extend these studies to the alternative substrate nohla,
several bh4 analogues, and the oxygenase domain of the
endothelial isoform (enos).
materials and methods
materials. recombinant rat brain full-length bh4-containing (1 bh4 per dimer) and bh4-deficient (<0.1 bh4 per
dimer)  xxxg1577xxx  were purified from baculovirus-infected insect
cells as previously described (24-26). the enos and  xxxg1577xxx 
oxygenase domains were obtained using standard molecular
biological techniques (16). the cdna fragments coding for
the oxygenase domains of  xxxg1577xxx  and enos were kind gifts
from drs. d. s. bredt and s. h. snyder, and from dr. w. c.
sessa, respectively. bh4 and nohla were from alexis
biochemicals (lausen, switzerland); 7,8-dihydro-l-biopterin
(bh2), 4-aminotetrahydrobiopterin [(6r)-2,4-diamino-5,6,7,8tetrahydro-6-(l- xxxd2033xxx -1′,2′-dihydroxypropyl)pteridine, 4-amino-bh4], and 5-methyl-bh4 (5-methyl-6,7,8-trihydrobiopterin) were purchased from dr. b. schircks laboratories
(jona, switzerland). l-arginine and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (chaps) were from
sigma. sodium dithionite was obtained from fluka. oxygen
(99.995% pure) was from air products (paris, france). other
reagents were purchased from merck.
low-temperature spectroscopy. absorbance spectra were
recorded from 350 to 700 nm with a cary 3e (varian)
spectrophotometer in the double beam mode (slit width 1.5
nm). data acquisition was in steps of 0.5 nm, with an
acquisition time of 0.033-0.5 s per data point. the instrument was equipped with a home-built double sample
compartment which allowed spectral recordings at low
temperature as previously described (16). to prevent freezing

of the samples, the experiments were performed in 1:1 (v/v)
mixtures of ethylene glycol/water, containing 50 mm kpi
(ph 7.4), 1 mm chaps, 0.5 mm edta, and 1 mm
 xxxd26xxx . the ph of this mixed solvent is fairly
insensitive to temperature changes, and the presence of
ethylene glycol did not affect the spectral properties of nos.
the sodium dithionite stock solution (23 mm) was prepared
in the same solvent. prior to use, argon was bubbled through
the solutions for 30 min. the nos samples were diluted in
anaerobic buffers at final concentrations of 2-4 µm in total
volumes of 1-2 ml in teflon closed cuvettes. reduction
was achieved at 15 °c by addition of 10-20 µl of a
concentrated solution of sodium dithionite (final concentration 230 µm) using a hamilton syringe. after lowering the
temperature to -30 °c, precooled oxygen (2-5 ml) was
bubbled through the enzyme solution with a syringe. absorbance spectra (recording time 2 min) were measured
immediately after oxygen addition, and after intervals as
specified.
additional methods. nos activity was determined as the
formation of l-[2,3,4,5-3h]citrulline from l-[2,3,4,5-3h]arginine (27).
bh4 binding was assessed with [3h]-bh4 according to a
published procedure (8, 28) with slight modifications. the
enzyme (30 nm enos oxygenase domain) was incubated
for 10 min at 37 °c in the presence of 50 mm triethanolamine
(ph 7.4), 10 nm [3h]-bh4, 0.1 mm arg, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and various concentrations of unlabeled bh4 (0-1 mm)
in a total volume of 0.1 ml, followed by vacuum filtration
(multiscreen assay system, millipore) and liquid scintillation counting of bound radioactivity. since no bound bh4
could be detected in the presence of 50% ethylene glycol,
due to the low pterin-affinity of the enzyme under these
conditions (vide infra), we repeated the experiments with 2
µm enos oxygenase domain and 0.2 µm [3h]-bh4 in total
volumes of 22.5 µl.
results
effect of ethylene glycol on nos activity and pterin
affinity. all experiments reported here were performed in
the presence of 50% ethylene glycol. we found previously
that  xxxg1577xxx  is still able to catalyze the transformation of
l-arginine into  xxxd2429xxx  under those conditions (16). in
the course of the present study, we noticed that the properties
of  xxxg1577xxx  in the presence of exogenous bh4 were always
indistinguishable from those of  xxxg1577xxx  containing 1 equiv of
bh4 per dimer. since this suggests that under the present
conditions  xxxg1577xxx  was unable to bind a second equivalent of
bh4, we decided to look into the effects of ethylene glycol
on nos activity in greater detail.
in one series of experiments, we determined how the
activity of bh4-deficient  xxxg1577xxx  (∼6% per heme) depended
on the concentration of exogenous bh4. in the absence of
ethylene glycol, bh4 induced an increase in the rate of
citrulline formation from 21 ( 17 to 371 ( 4 nmol‚mg-1‚
min-1 with an ec50 of 18 ( 4 nm, in agreement with previous reports (10). in 50% ethylene glycol, bh4 increased
the activity from less than 2 to 84 ( 7 nmol‚mg-1‚min-1
with an ec50 of 39 ( 14 µm.
in another series of experiments, we determined how
5-methyl-bh4 affected the activity of bh4-containing

 xxxg1577xxx  (1 equiv per dimer). we recently reported that
5-methyl-bh4 can substitute for bh4 in nos catalysis (29).
in the absence of ethylene glycol, 5-methyl-bh4 increased
the activity from 560 ( 20 to 1130 ( 20 nmol of
citrulline‚mg-1‚min-1 with an ec50 of 2.6 ( 0.4 µm, in line
with prior observations (30). in the presence of 50% ethylene
glycol, 5-methyl-bh4 increased the activity from 17 ( 1 to
150 ( 20 nmol‚mg-1‚min-1 with an ec50 of 1.8 ( 0.7 mm.
finally, we determined the effect of ethylene glycol on
the pterin affinity of the enos oxygenase domain directly
in radioligand binding studies. control experiments without
ethylene glycol yielded a kd for bh4 of 0.05 ( 0.01 µm in
the presence of 0.1 mm arg, in accordance with previous
observations with full-length enos (28). in the presence of
50% ethylene glycol, we observed a kd of 7 ( 3 µm.
these results demonstrate that nos activity decreased
considerably in the presence of ethylene glycol. more
importantly, the pterin affinity of the enzyme was greatly
diminished. it has been demonstrated that nos binds bh4
anticooperatively, with 1 equiv remaining tightly bound under
most conditions (10). the presence of 50% ethylene glycol
resulted in an activity decrease by 97% for  xxxg1577xxx  containing
1 equiv of bh4 per dimer, and by at least 90% for  xxxg1577xxx 
containing 6% bh4. these observations suggest that the
tightly bound endogenous bh4 is lost in the presence of 50%
ethylene glycol. exogenous bh4 partly restored activity, but
the ec50 values indicate that ethylene glycol lowered the
pterin affinity by 3 orders of magnitude; direct binding
studies confirmed this dramatic decrease in affinity. moreover, ethylene glycol reduced the maximal activities in the
presence of exogenous pterin by more than 50%. this
suggests that only the high-affinity pterin-binding site is
occupied under these conditions, in line with the observation
that prompted these experiments, i.e., that exogenous bh4
does not affect the results obtained with  xxxg1577xxx  containing 1
equiv of bh4. consequently, it seems that the species
obtained in the presence of 50% ethylene glycol contains
maximally one pteridine per dimer.
reactions of dithionite-reduced nos with o2 in the
presence of arg. we have previously reported that the
reaction of reduced full-length  xxxg1577xxx  (lambdamax 412 nm) with
o2 in the combined presence of arg and bh4 proceeds via
a blue-shifted intermediate (lambdamax 404.5 nm), whereas a redshift (lambdamax 415 nm) was observed for the pterin-free enzyme

are the optical absorption spectra of the anaerobically reduced enos
oxygenase domain (‚‚‚), the spectrum immediately after o2 addition

the spectrum after transient warming to room temperature (- - -).
experimental conditions: 2 µm enos oxygenase domain, 50 mm
kpi (ph 7.4), 1 mm chaps, 0.5 mm edta, 1 mm  xxxd26xxx , 50% ethylene glycol, 0.2 mm arg, and 25 µm 4-aminobh4. see materials and methods for further details.

(16). with the isolated  xxxg1577xxx  oxygenase domain, no
intermediate could be detected (16). here we found that the
transformation of reduced enos oxygenase domain to highspin fe(iii) (lambdamax 395 nm) in the presence of arg also
occurred without accumulation of an intermediate (table 1).
similar observations were made with the no synthesissupporting pteridines bh4 and 5-me-bh4 (table 1).
different results were obtained in the presence of the
inhibitory pteridines bh2 and 4-amino-bh4. in the presence
of bh2, an intermediate spectrum typical of an oxyferrous
complex was formed (lambdamax 417 nm, table 1). this complex
slowly decomposed to the ferric high-spin form. with
4-amino-bh4, the intermediate spectrum was strongly redshifted (lambdamax 431 nm, figure 1). the maximum then shifted
slowly to 420 nm, but remained stable afterward. only after
warming the sample to room temperature and readjusting
the temperature to -30 °c, the final ferric species, a mixture
of high- and low-spin heme, was obtained. it should be noted
that ferric enos oxygenase domain in the presence of
4-amino-bh4 and arg was completely high-spin before
reduction. similar observations were made with  xxxg1577xxx 
oxygenase domain (not shown).

reactions of dithionite-reduced nos with o2 in the
presence of nohla. in the presence of nohla and bh4,
addition of o2 to reduced enos oxygenase at -30 °c
resulted in the immediate appearance of a spectrum with
contributions from three compounds: the soret region
exhibited maxima at 417 and 439 nm, and a shoulder at 395
nm (figure 2). the shoulder most likely reflected formation
of the oxidized species. the 417 nm peak probably originated
from the oxyferrous complex of the bh4-free subunit. the
species absorbing at 439 nm could be identified as a ferric
no complex. indeed, by subtracting spectral contributions
from the ferric species and the oxyferrous complex of 10%
and 45%, respectively, a homogeneous spectrum was obtained with properties typical of an fe(iii)‚no complex
(soret band at 439.5 nm and visible bands at 545 and 582
nm, not shown). the conversion of the composite spectrum
to high-spin ferric heme was monophasic. in the presence
of 5-methyl-bh4, the spectral changes were similar (table
1). identical observations were made with full-length  xxxg1577xxx 
and  xxxg1577xxx  oxygenase domain (not shown).
in the absence of pteridines, intermediates with a soret
peak at 416 nm were formed with full-length  xxxg1577xxx  (not
shown) and with enos oxygenase domain (table 1). in the
presence of bh2 (figure 3) and 4-amino-bh4 (table 1),
red-shifted intermediates (lambdamax 425 and 423 nm, respectively)
were formed. the species obtained with bh2 was transformed into high-spin ferric heme at -30 °c, but decay of
the intermediate observed with 4-amino-bh4 yielded a
spectrum indicative of the low-spin ferric state (lambdamax 417 nm),
which was converted to high-spin only after warming the
sample to room temperature and readjusting to -30 °c (not
shown).

cumulated, which provides strong support for our hypothesis
(16) that bh4 functions as an electron donor during reductive
activation of the fe(ii)‚o2 complex,2 a role that bh2 cannot
fulfill.
when arg was replaced by nohla, we also observed
an oxyferrous heme intermediate, but in this case the soret
peak was red-shifted by 8 nm (lambdamax 425 nm). the spectral
properties of the nos oxyferrous complex have been the
object of some controversy. in stopped-flow studies with
 xxxg1577xxx  oxygenase domain, stuehr and co-workers observed
a maximum at 427 nm, independent of the presence of arg
or bh4 (31-33). this peak position is significantly redshifted in comparison to the corresponding cytochrome p450
species, which display maxima between 416 and 423 nm
(20). a peak position within the latter range (lambdamax 415-417
nm) was found by us in low-temperature studies with fulllength  xxxg1577xxx  (16). in confirmation of our observations, rapidscan spectra with full-length  xxxg1577xxx  yielded a soret peak at
417 nm in the absence of bh4 and arg (34); a red-shifted
spectrum (lambdamax 427 nm) was obtained in the presence of arg
and bh4 in the same study. similar spectral properties as
observed by us (lambdamax 419 nm) were also found by others in
low-temperature studies of  xxxg1577xxx  oxygenase domain in the
presence of bh4 and the substrate analogue ng-methyl-larginine (35).
one cause for the variations in peak positions observed
by us might be that some of the spectra represent mixtures
of the intermediate species and the initial and final states.
indeed, several of the intermediate spectra that exhibited
soret maxima at wavelengths below 420 nm could be
constructed from combinations of the initial (deoxy-ferrous)

discussion
intermediates formed in the presence of bh2. bh2 binds
to nos, but does not support no synthesis (8). it was
therefore of interest to establish how this competitive
inhibitor of no synthesis affects the reaction of reduced nos
with o2. with the enos oxygenase domain, and in the
presence of arg, oxyferrous heme (lambdamax 417 nm) ac-

2 there is considerable variation in the literature of cytochrome p450
and nos concerning the representation of the intermediates in the
reaction of reduced heme with o2. the proper formal notation for the
complex of dioxygen with reduced heme is fe(iii)-o2•, which is how
we designated the compound in prior publications (4, 16). however,
in our experience this sometimes gave rise to confusion regarding the
true nature of the complex. therefore, we opted for fe(ii)‚o2 in the
present paper; we use this representation and the term ‘oxyferrous
complex’ in a general sense, without referring to a specific structure
of the complex.

redox function of bh4 in  xxxd2738xxx  synthase
and final (high-spin ferric) spectra, together with a contribution from one of the more red-shifted intermediate spectra.
for example, the intermediate spectrum obtained in the
presence of arg and bh2, which displayed a maximum at
417 nm, could be reproduced in every detail by combining
50% of the deoxy-reduced species, 10% of the high-spin
oxidized species, and 40% of the 431 nm intermediate that
we observed in the presence of arg and 4-amino-bh4 (not
shown). other examples are given in table 1.
however, incomplete accumulation of the oxyferrous
complex cannot explain all spectral differences: the intermediate spectra at 423/425 nm with nohla and 4-aminobh4/bh2, and the spectrum at 431 nm with arg and
4-amino-bh4 definitely derive from distinct species. the
varying peak positions with different substrates are reminiscent of the red-shifts of variable magnitude that were
reported with a range of substrates for cytochrome p450cam
(20). apparently, oxyferrous heme can display a fairly broad
range of absorbance maxima, depending on the bound
substrate and pterin analogues. definitive confirmation of
this observation must await additional studies with different
spectroscopic methods.
intermediates formed in the presence of 4-amino-bh4.
because the electrochemical properties of 4-amino-bh4 do
not rule out redox activity a priori (a. c. f. gorren,
unpublished observations), assignment of the intermediate
spectra is less straightforward than with bh2, but the
similarities of the spectra obtained with 4-amino-bh4 and
bh2 suggest that they can all be ascribed to oxyferrous
complexes. we attribute the striking red-shift in the presence
of arg and 4-amino-bh4 to conformational or electronic
changes around the heme pocket. perhaps more remarkable
than the red-shift is the extremely slow and, in the case of
arg, incomplete recovery of high-spin ferric heme at -30
°c. in the presence of nohla, a species absorbing at 418
nm was formed, which most likely represents low-spin ferric
heme. the final spectrum observed with arg at -30 °c (lambdamax
420 nm) was not due to a separate species, but to a
combination of the 431 nm oxyferrous species and the highspin/low-spin ferric mixture obtained after transient warming
to room temperature.
4-amino-bh4 belongs to the group of pteridines that can
act as bh4-competitive inhibitors of nos activity (13, 14,
36). unlike the 7,8-dihydropteridines, however, the redox
properties of 4-amino-bh4 resemble those of bh4 (a. c.
f. gorren, unpublished observations). the present observations show that, nevertheless, 4-amino-bh4 does not function
as an electron donor to the oxyferrous complex. the sluggish
oxidation of reduced nos in the presence of 4-amino-bh4,
and the incomplete regeneration of the high-spin ferric
compound with arg, may be indicative of more extensive
structural changes during reoxidation than take place with
other pterins. although the present results do not enable us
to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of 4-amino-bh4, they
may hold important clues, since they represent the first case
of 4-amino-bh4 behaving differently from both the activitysustaining pterins (bh4, 5-methyl-bh4) and the redoxinactive inhibitory pteridines (exemplified by bh2).

absorbing at 395, 417, and 439 nm, which we ascribe to
high-spin ferric heme, the oxyferrous complex, and the ferric
no complex, respectively. in our view, the simultaneous
observation of both oxyferrous heme, on the one hand, and
a mixture of ferric heme and ferric no complex, on the other,
reflects the stoichiometry of 1 bh4 bound per nos dimer.
in agreement with this proposal, about half of the enzyme
is present as the oxyferrous intermediate. these results
confirm that the two subunits function independently (37,
38).

scheme 2: postulated role of bh4 in nos catalysis in the reaction cycles with arg (left) and nohla (right)a

a
by allowing the oxyferrous complex to react rapidly with arg (left) or nohla (right), bh4 prevents the uncoupled production of o2-. during
the reaction cyle with arg, the pteridine is oxidized to a bh3• radical in the process. this radical can be trapped under the experimental conditions
applied in this study, because nohla formation requires two electrons, whereas only one electron per nos monomer is available. the corresponding
intermediate in the reaction with nohla is not detectable, because one electron is sufficient for citrulline formation. see discussion for further
details. the substrates arg and nohla are bound in the vicinity of the heme throughout the reaction cycle, but were omitted from the scheme for
the sake of clarity.  xxxd1710xxx .:  xxxd2429xxx .

in the presence of bh4 or 5-me-bh, oxidation was rapid
and complete, resulting in formation of the ferric no
complex as the first observable species, whereas in their
absence the reaction sequence was halted at the level of
oxyferrous heme, which slowly decayed, presumably with
concomitant production of o2-. these findings demonstrate
that the pterin is required for product formation from
nohla and the fe(ii)‚o2 complex. we therefore propose
that, as previously postulated for the reaction with arg (16),
bh4 is required for reductive activation of oxyferrous heme
in the reaction with nohla as well.
finally, it should be noted that the decay of the two
intermediate species formed in the presence of nohla and
bh4 (oxyferrous compound and ferric no complex) was
monophasic. this implies that relaxation of the ferric noheme complex is coupled to decay of the oxyferrous species.
decay of the no-heme complex could occur by no
dissociation followed by its reaction with o2, or by a direct
reaction of o2 with the no-heme complex. the latter
reaction was found to underly nos activity under conditions
of maximal autoinhibition by no (39), but may be less
prominent under the present conditions, because of the
oxidized state of the heme. neither reaction can explain the
observed monophasic decay. however, monophasic relaxation would occur if the ferric no-heme complex reacted
with o2- produced by an intrinsically slower reaction of the
bh4-free subunit (scheme 1). extrapolation of this observation to normal catalysis suggests how half-pterin-saturated
nos might produce no/o2- in a concerted way (6).
role of bh4 as a one-electron donor in nos catalysis.
the question whether bh4 has a redox-active role is one of
the most contested issues of nos catalysis (for recent
reviews, see refs 3-6). the best documented effects of bh4
are allosteric and structural in nature: stimulation of the lowto-high-spin heme transition, substrate binding, and nos
dimerization (7-12). however, unlike no synthesis, none
of these effects absolutely requires the presence of bh4,

which implies that the main function of bh4 must be a
different one. moreover, all pterins that bind to nos mimick
the structural and allosteric effects of bh4, but only redoxactive pterins can substitute for bh4 with respect to no
synthesis (8, 13-15), which suggests that the unidentified
function of bh4 involves its electrochemical properties. the
recent observation that 5-methyl-bh4 supports no synthesis
(29) demonstrates that two-electron redox cycling between
bh4 and quinonoid bh2, as occurs during aromatic amino
acid hydroxylation, is not required for nos catalysis, but it
does not rule out one-electron redox cycling between bh4
and bh3•.
we previously presented evidence that bh4 provides one
electron to oxyferrous heme during the o2 reaction of
dithionite-reduced nos in the presence of arg (16). the
present study suggests that the same occurs in the reaction
with nohla. scheme 2 summarizes the hypothetical
reactions of reduced nos with arg and nohla. the key
observation of this study, i.e., that the reaction step following
formation of the oxyferrous complex in both cycles requires
bh4, agrees with recent observations by other investigators
(40), but the conclusions drawn from those studies are
diametrically opposed to ours. abu-soud et al. ruled out a
redox-active role of bh4 in the reaction with arg partly on
the basis of their observations with nohla. only one
electron is required for net no formation from nohla,
and most current models have nohla itself serving as the
electron donor for oxyferrous heme (1-4, 41). consequently,
a redox function of bh4 in the second cycle was dismissed
and, by analogy, it was deemed unlikely in the first cycle as
well (40).
one crucial difference between our observations and those
of abu-soud et al. is that we obtained product formation
from reduced nos and arg in the presence of bh4 (16),
whereas they reported citrulline formation from nohla,
but no nohla formation from arg (40). the latter
observation would imply that bh4 is not a suitable electron

redox function of bh4 in  xxxd2738xxx  synthase
source in the catalytic cyle with arg. however, almost
stoichiometric formation of nohla from arg was recently
confirmed with the inos oxygenase domain by marletta and
colleagues (42). during the preparation of this paper, stuehr
and co-workers also reported nohla formation from arg,
although still with a significantly lower stoichiometry (33).
the cause for the discrepancy is unclear, but may originate
from different detection methods. all three research groups
used hplc for product analysis, but whereas elution in our
and marletta’s protocols was performed at ph 7 or lower,
stuehr and co-workers applied a ph of 9.5, and under the
latter conditions nohla is more labile.
support for the unprecedented role of pterin as a oneelectron donor has come from x-ray crystallographic studies
(22). recently, direct evidence for the formation of a pterin
radical in the reaction with arg was obtained with epr
spectroscopy by us (unpublished observations) and marletta
and co-workers (42). in the latter study, it was shown that
formation of the radical was almost completely quenched
with nohla as the substrate. from these results, it was
concluded that bh4 serves as an electron donor in the first
cycle only. however, this leaves the function of bh4 in the
second cycle unexplained, and in our view it is unlikely that,
with an efficient electron donor to the oxyferrous complex
already in place, the reaction would follow different pathways
at this stage of the two cycles. our data suggest rapid
rereduction of bh3• as a plausible alternative explanation
for the absence of a pterin radical signal (scheme 2). rapid
regeneration of ferric heme and bh4 in the reaction with
nohla is likely, since the second cycle consumes only one
electron. rapid completion of the cycle would also explain
why no nohla-derived radical was detected (42), an
observation that is hard to account for otherwise. therefore,
we propose that bh4 reduces the oxyferrous complex in both
cycles (scheme 2), but that single-turnover experiments allow
detection of the bh3• radical in the first cycle only.
taken together, the evidence for one-electron transfer by
bh4 under the conditions applied in these and similar studies
is overwhelming, but whether the same reaction is also an
obligatory step under physiological conditions remains to be
established. work is currently in progress in our laboratories
to resolve this important issue.
