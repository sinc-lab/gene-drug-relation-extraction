interaction of neuroleptics and antidepressants with rat brain alpha 2-receptors: a possible relationship between alpha 2-receptor antagonism and a...  the relative potencies of a variety of neuroleptic drugs and antidepressant agents in competing for the binding of 3h-clonidine and 3h-yohimbine to alpha 2-adrenergic receptors of the rat cerebral cortex were quantified. the rank order of potencies of neuroleptics tested in competing for both ligand bindings is: clocapramine, carpipramine much greater than perphenazine, fluphenazine, alpha,beta- xxxd2137xxx  greater than  xxxd2885xxx ,  xxxd2474xxx  greater than chlorpromazine,  xxxd2956xxx  greater than moperone much greater than haloperidol, sulpiride. among the antidepressants,  xxxd2637xxx  is the most potent antidepressant. amitriptyline has a substantial affinity, while desipramine, imipramine, and clomipramine are the least potent. it is concluded that a number of neuroleptics and antidepressant agents display a potent or moderate affinity to alpha 2-receptor sites. these findings support the suggestion that some neuroleptics enhance the release of norepinephrine (ne) mainly by acting on presynaptic alpha 2-receptors, and that the alpha 2-receptor blocking property may have an important role in the mechanism of the antidepressant effect of some neuroleptic compounds.
