benzodiazepine site agonists or inverse agonists enhance or reduce gamma-aminobutyric acida (gabaa) receptormediated inhibition of neurons, respectively. recently, it was demonstrated that the point mutation gamma2f77i
causes a drastic change in the afﬁnity of a variety of benzodiazepine agonists or inverse agonists in receptor
binding studies. here we investigated the potency and efﬁcacy of 10 benzodiazepine site ligands from 6
structural classes in wild-type and gamma2f77i point mutated recombinant gabaa receptors composed of
alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2, alpha4beta3gamma2, alpha5beta3gamma2, and alpha6beta3gamma2 subunits. results indicate that the effects of the
benzodiazepine site ligands zolpidem, zopiclone, cl218872, l-655,708 and dmcm were nearly completely
eliminated in all mutated receptors up to a 1 mum concentration. the effects of bretazenil, ro15-1788 or
abecarnil were eliminated in some, but not all mutated receptors, suggesting that the gamma2f77i mutation
differentially inﬂuences the actions of these ligands in different receptor subtypes. in addition, this point
mutation also inﬂuences the efﬁcacy of diazepam for enhancing gaba-induced chloride ﬂux, suggesting that
the amino acid residue gamma2f77 might also be involved in the transduction of the effect of benzodiazepines
from binding to gating. the application of these drugs in a novel mouse model is discussed.

1. introduction
gabaa receptors are chloride ion channels that can be opened by
gaba. these receptors are composed of ﬁve subunits that can belong
to different subunit classes. 19 different subunits (6alpha, 3beta, 3gamma, delta, epsilon, pi, theta,
3rho) have been identiﬁed and could give rise to a large variety of
different gabaa receptor subtypes with distinct subunit composition.
the majority of gabaa receptors found in the brain, however, are
composed of 1gamma and 2alpha and 2beta subunits (olsen and sieghart, 2008).
gabaa receptors can be modulated by a large variety of
pharmacologically and clinically important drugs, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neuroactive steroids, anesthetics and convulsants. a variety of evidence indicates that these compounds exert
their action via distinct allosteric binding sites on these receptors
(sieghart, 1995). the benzodiazepine binding site of gabaa receptors
so far has been most thoroughly investigated. it is located in the
extracellular domain of gabaa receptors at the interface formed by alpha
and gamma subunits (ernst et al., 2003; sigel and buhr, 1997). the currently
prescribed benzodiazepines and most of the structurally unrelated
compounds interacting with the benzodiazepine binding site of
gabaa receptors mediate their effects predominantly by interacting

with gabaa receptors composed of alpha1betagamma2, alpha2betagamma2, alpha3betagamma2 or alpha5betagamma2
subunits (sieghart, 1995).
the point mutation gamma2f77i has been demonstrated previously to
drastically reduce the afﬁnity of some but not all benzodiazepine site
ligands for the mutated receptors (buhr et al., 1997; ogris et al., 2004;
wingrove et al., 1997). this led to its application in the recently
developed “loxgamma2f77i-swap mouse model” (wulff et al., 2007). this
model uses the strategy to ﬁrst eliminate the interaction of certain
drugs with gabaa receptors all over the brain using transgenic mice
containing the point mutation gamma2f77i in the  xxxg842xxx  subunit gene (cope et
al., 2005, 2004) and then to replace the gamma2f77i subunit by the wildtype  xxxg842xxx  subunit in speciﬁc neurons, only (wulff et al., 2007). by a
systemic application of benzodiazepine site ligands that cannot
interact with the point mutated gabaa receptors only the reintroduced wild-type receptors are modulated, allowing the function
of the respective neurons in the brain to be investigated.
in a previous study we identiﬁed several benzodiazepine site
ligands of different structural classes that exhibit a drastic reduction in
their afﬁnity for gabaa receptors containing the point mutation
gamma2f77i (ogris et al., 2004). the effect of this mutation on the potency
and efﬁcacy of most of these compounds in different gabaa receptor
subtypes so far is not known. here we investigated the effect of this
point mutation on the action of ligands that showed the strongest
reduction in the afﬁnity for the mutated receptors in various
recombinant gabaa receptors. results indicate that potency and
efﬁcacy of these compounds is distinct for each receptor subtype and

j. ramerstorfer et al. / european journal of pharmacology 636 (2010) 18–27

that the point mutation gamma2f77i more or less completely eliminates the
action of some of these compounds over a wide concentration range.
2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals
compounds were obtained from the following sources: diazepam
(7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2h-1,4-benzodiazepin-2one), ro15-1788 (ethyl-8-ﬂuoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4himidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate), bretazenil (tbutyl(s)-8-bromo-11,12,13,13a-tetrahydro-9-oxo-9h-imidazo[1,5-a]

roche, basle, switzerland); l-655,708 (ethyl-7-methoxy11,12,13,13a-tetrahydro-9-oxo-9h-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]
benzodiazepine-1-carboxylate) was purchased from tocris cookson
ltd. uk; methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate
(dmcm), (ferrosan, soeborg, denmark); zopiclone (4-methyl-1piperazinecarboxylic acid-6-(5-chloro-2-pyridinyl)-6,7-dihydro-7oxo-5h-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-5-yl ester) (rhone-poulenc, paris,
france); fg7142 (n-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide) was purchased from tocris bioscience uk; abecarnil (isopropyl-6-benzyloxy4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) was a gift of dr.
schneider, schering ag, germany; cl218872 (3-methyl-6-[3-triﬂuoromethyl-phenyl]-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine) (american cyanamide comp., wayne, n.j., u.s.a.); zolpidem (n,n,6-trimethyl-2-(4methylphenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]-pyridine-3- xxxd63xxx ) (synthelabo
recherche, bagneux, france).
2.2. two-electrode voltage clamp
cdnas of rat gabaa receptor subunits  xxxg830xxx ,  xxxg833xxx ,  xxxg838xxx , and gamma2s were
cloned as described (ebert et al., 1996). cdnas of the rat subunits  xxxg831xxx ,
 xxxg832xxx , and  xxxg834xxx  were gifts from p. malherbe and that of  xxxg835xxx  subunits was a
gift from p. seeburg. after linearizing the cdna vectors with
appropriate restriction endonucleases, capped transcripts were
produced using the mmessage mmachine® t7 transcription kit
(ambion, tx). the capped transcripts were polyadenylated using
yeast poly(a) polymerase (usb, oh) and were diluted and stored in
diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water at −70 °c.
the methods used for isolating, culturing, injecting and defolliculating of oocytes were identical with those described by sigel et al.,
(1990) and were described elsewhere (li et al., 2003). mature female
xenopus laevis (nasco, wi) were anesthetized in a bath of ice-cold
0.17% tricain (ethyl-m-aminobenzoat, sigma, mo) before decapitation and removal of the frogs' ovary. stage 5 to 6 oocytes with the
follicle cell layer around them were singled out of the ovary using a
platinum wire loop. oocytes were stored and incubated at 18 °c in
modiﬁed barths' medium (88 mm nacl, 10 mm hepes–naoh (ph
7.4), 2.4 mm nahco3, 1 mm kcl, 0.82 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 0.41 mm cacl2,
0.34 mm ca(no3)2) that was supplemented with 100 u/ml penicillin
and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. oocytes with follicle cell layers still
around them were injected with an aqueous solution of crna. a total
of 2.5 ng of crna per oocyte was injected. subunit ratio was 1:1:5 for
alphaxbeta3gamma2. after injection of crna, oocytes were incubated for at least
36 h before the enveloping follicle cell layers were removed.
collagenase-treatment (type ia, sigma, mo) and mechanically
defolliculating of the oocytes was described elsewhere (li et al.,
2003).
for electrophysiological recordings, oocytes were placed on a
nylon-grid in a bath of xenopus ringer solution (xr solution,
containing 90 mm nacl, 5 mm hepes–naoh (ph 7.4), 1 mm mgcl2,
1 mm kcl and 1 mm cacl2). the oocytes were constantly washed by a
ﬂow of 6 ml/min xr solution which could be switched to xr solution
containing gaba and/or drugs. for current measurements the oocytes
were impaled with two microelectrodes (2–3 momega) which were ﬁlled

19

with 2 m kcl. maximum currents measured in crna injected oocytes
were in the microampere range for all subtypes of gabaa receptors.
drugs were diluted into xr solution from dmso-solutions
resulting in a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1% dmso perfusing the oocytes.
drugs were pre-applied for 30 s before the addition of gaba, which
was then co-applied with the drugs until a peak response was
observed. between two applications, oocytes were washed in xr
solution for up to 15 min to ensure full recovery from desensitization.
to test for modulation of gaba-induced currents by drugs a
concentration of gaba that was titrated to trigger 3% of the respective
maximum gaba-elicited current of the individual oocyte (ec3) was
applied to the cell together with various concentrations of drugs. such
a low gaba concentration corresponds with that occurring at
extrasynaptic receptors, that represent the majority of gabaa
receptors in the brain (farrant and nusser, 2005) and results in a
situation where probably only one of the two gaba binding sites of
the receptors is occupied (walters et al., 2000). in addition, this low
gaba concentration is in the ﬂat part of the dose–response curve, and
thus, the data are not as much dependent on slight variations in the
gaba concentration. at this gaba concentration benzodiazepine site
agonists are producing stronger effects, whereas inverse agonists
sometimes (but not always) are showing weaker effects compared to
higher gaba concentrations. to use comparable conditions for
positive and negative allosteric modulators, we decided to perform
all measurements at gaba ec3. all recordings were performed at
room temperature at a holding potential of −60 mv using a warner
oc-725c two-electrode voltage clamp (warner instruments, hamden, ct) or a dagan ca-1b oocyte clamp (dagan corporation,
minneapolis, mn). data were digitized, recorded and measured
using a digidata 1322a data acquisition system (axon instruments,
union city, ca).

3. results
3.1. potency and efﬁcacy of benzodiazepine site ligands for various
gabaa receptor subtypes
to determine the effect of the gamma2f77i point mutation on the potency
and efﬁcacy of gabaa receptor subtypes, it was necessary to compare
these parameters with the respective wild-type receptors. on screening
the available literature concerning the action of benzodiazepine site
ligands at different receptor subtypes it is evident that complete dose–
response curves for  xxxg830xxx –6betagamma2 receptors only rarely have been published.
in many cases only the maximum efﬁcacy of a drug at only a few
receptor subtypes has been reported although recently it became clear
that the spectrum of in vivo actions of a compound depends on its
relative potency and efﬁcacy at the various receptor subtypes especially
at low drug concentrations (rivas et al., 2009; savic et al., 2008). in
addition, the few data available have been generated in different
heterologous expression systems (xenopus oocytes, hek cells, mouse
ﬁbroblast l(tk−) cells, etc.), using two-electrode voltage clamp or patch
clamp techniques, using gabaa receptor subunits from different species
(rat, mouse, human) and sometimes even using a mixture of subunits
from different species (petroski et al., 2006). furthermore, different beta
subunits were used in combination with alpha and  xxxg842xxx  subunits, the buffer
solution, perfusion velocity, electrophysiological conditions (voltage
clamped between −60 and −80 mv) and the concentration of gaba
applied in these experiments differed in different publications (ec3–
ec50) as did the experimental protocol (rapidity and duration of gaba
or drug application, washing conditions in between measurements).
the data, thus, in most cases cannot be directly compared (hevers and
luddens, 1998; olsen and sieghart, 2008). to investigate possible
changes in potency and efﬁcacy of benzodiazepine site ligands induced
by the gamma2f77i point mutation, we thus also had to investigate the effects
of these ligands on the wild-type receptors.

here we used the two-electrode voltage clamp method to
determine the complete dose–response curves of 10 different
benzodiazepines site ligands from 6 different structural classes in
recombinant gabaa receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes and
composed of alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2, alpha4beta3gamma2, alpha5beta3gamma2, or
alpha6beta3gamma2 subunits. none of the compounds investigated (see structural
formula in fig. 1) was able to elicit a chloride current in the absence of
gaba in the concentration range investigated, but all of them were
able to modulate gaba-induced chloride ﬂux. as indicated in figs. 2a
and 3a, diazepam dose-dependently enhanced currents elicited by a
gaba concentration generating 3% of the maximum gaba current of
the alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2, or alpha5beta3gamma2 receptor (gaba ec3) with

fig. 1. structures of compounds used in this study.

a potency (ec50) of 63 ± 11 nm, 34 ± 2 nm, 93 ± 7 nm or 32 ± 4 nm,
respectively (table 1). under our conditions, diazepam exhibited its
highest efﬁcacy for alpha3betagamma2 receptors. at this receptor subtype gaba
ec3 control current (100%) was stimulated up to 738 ± 36% by
diazepam. gaba ec3 currents of alpha2beta3gamma2 receptors were stimulated to
532 ± 20% and those of alpha1beta3gamma2 or alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors were stimulated
to 324 ± 22% or 321 ± 14%, respectively. diazepam did not stimulate
gaba-induced chloride ﬂux in alpha4beta3gamma2 or in alpha6beta3gamma2 receptors. these
data are consistent with results published previously (dawson et al.,
2006; puia et al., 1991; smith et al., 2001).
in agreement with previous results investigating receptors containing
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  subunits (baur and sigel, 2007; petroski et al., 2006; sanna et al., 2002)
the imidazopyridine zolpidem exhibited the highest potency for receptors
containing  xxxg830xxx  subunits (fig. 3b). an approximately 5–8-fold higher
zolpidem concentration is needed to generate a comparable enhancement
of gaba-induced chloride ﬂux in alpha2beta3gamma2 or alpha3beta3gamma2 receptors. due to the
relatively low potency of zolpidem, no saturating stimulation could be
reached up to 10 mum (fig. 2b), and thus, correct ec50 values cannot be
given. at 1 or 10 mum concentrations, however, zolpidem stimulated gabainduced chloride ﬂux to 310±36% or 417±51%, 280±19% or 511±9%,
and 255±14% or 645±50% in alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, or alpha3beta3gamma2 receptors,
respectively (table 1). at these concentrations, therefore, due to its higher
efﬁcacy for alpha2beta3gamma2 or alpha3beta3gamma2 receptors, zolpidem has lost its  xxxg830xxx  subtype
selectivity. as expected, zolpidem, a compound that exhibits a very low
afﬁnity for alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors (sieghart, 1995), was unable to modulate
these receptors up to a concentration of 10 mum (baur and sigel, 2007;
petroski et al., 2006; sanna et al., 2002). zolpidem also did not signiﬁcantly
enhance gaba-induced chloride ﬂux in alpha4beta3gamma2 and alpha6beta3gamma2 receptors.
the cyclopyrrolone zopiclone dose-dependently enhanced gaba ec3
in receptors composed of alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2 or alpha5beta3gamma2 subunits
with an ec50 of 163±19 nm, 400±64 nm, n793 nm, or 176±1 nm and
a maximal stimulation to 383±36%, 356±22%, 559±30% or 345±22%
of control current, respectively (fig. 3c, table 1). zopiclone did not
signiﬁcantly stimulate gaba-induced chloride ﬂux in alpha4beta3gamma2 and
alpha6beta3gamma2 receptors up to a 10 mum concentration. these data conﬁrm and
extend previous results (fleck, 2002; petroski et al., 2006) and again
indicate that ec50 values cannot be used to predict a differential action of
drugs on different receptor subtypes.
the triazolopyridazine cl218872 dose-dependently enhanced
gaba ec3 in alpha1beta3gamma2, and with an approximately 3-fold reduced
potency in alpha3beta3gamma2 receptors (fig. 3d). the potency for enhancing
gaba current in alpha2beta3gamma2 was further reduced about 3-fold, whereas
only very weak stimulation (up to 128 ± 2%) of gaba current was
obtained for alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors. at 1 mum concentration this compound
seemed to exhibit no effect at alpha4beta3gamma2 receptors, whereas  xxxd1891xxx  mum
concentration it stimulated gaba-induced chloride ﬂux. however, no
signiﬁcant stimulation was obtained for alpha6beta3gamma2 receptors up to a
10 mum concentration. due to the low potency of this compound, no
ec50 values can be given, but 10 mum cl218872 stimulated gabainduced chloride current in alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2, alpha4beta3gamma2 or
alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors to 214 ± 13%, 162 ± 3%, 195 ± 8%, 199 ± 27%, or
128 ± 2%, respectively (table 1). these data conﬁrm and extend
previous results (wafford et al., 1993a,b).
in this study we investigated three different imidazobenzodiazepines. the imidazobenzodiazepine bretazenil (fig. 3e) in agreement with previous results (atack, 2003; knoﬂach et al., 1996; puia
et al., 1992) weakly stimulated gaba-induced chloride ﬂux with
ec50's of 4 ± 1 nm, 7 ± 1 nm, 15 ± 2 nm, or 9 ± 2 nm and a maximal
stimulation of 138 ± 10%, 129 ± 10, 234 ± 17% or 228 ± 23%, for
alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2 or alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors, respectively
(table 1). this compound thus preferentially activates alpha3beta3gamma2
and alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors. interestingly, bretazenil exhibited a lower
potency (ec50 of n354 nm) but a much stronger efﬁcacy (stimulation to 395 ± 8%) at alpha4beta3gamma2 receptors. for alpha6beta3gamma2 receptors,
ec50 and maximal stimulation of this compound was n322 nm and
231 ± 13%, respectively (knoﬂach et al., 1996).

and d reﬂect a stronger expression of alpha1beta3gamma2f77 receptors.

the imidazobenzodiazepine ro15-1788 (ﬂumazenil) exhibited no
signiﬁcant effects on gaba-induced chloride currents in alpha1beta3gamma2 and
alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors (fig. 4a), but weakly stimulated gaba ec3 in alpha2beta3gamma2
and alpha3beta3gamma2 receptors with an ec50 of 5 ± 1 nm and 11± 5 nm and a
maximal stimulation of gaba-induced chloride ﬂux to 133 ± 7% and
157 ± 8%, respectively. this compound, however, stimulated gabainduced chloride ﬂux in alpha4beta3gamma2 receptors with an ec50 of n232 nm up
to 181 ± 10% and in alpha6beta3gamma2 with an ec50 of n204 nm up to 179 ± 6%
(table 1). these data conﬁrm and extend previous results (hadingham
et al., 1996; june et al., 2003; whittemore et al., 1996).
the imidazobenzodiazepine l-655,708 (fig. 4b) in receptor
binding assays exhibits a 30–50-fold selectivity for  xxxg834xxx  receptors
(atack et al., 2006; quirk et al., 1996). in electrophysiological studies
it behaved as an  xxxd1422xxx  at alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors (reduction of
chloride current to 84 ± 5 or 66 ± 7% at 1 mum or 10 mum concentration,
respectively; table 1), and as a low potency weak partial inverse
agonist at alpha1beta3gamma2 and alpha2beta3gamma2 receptors (reduction of gabainduced chloride ﬂux to 90%  xxxd1891xxx  mum concentration). this

compound for these receptors thus exhibited properties comparable
to those published previously (atack et al., 2006). the slightly
smaller efﬁcacy as well as the smaller potency observed for alpha5beta3gamma2
receptors in our study probably were due to the fact that our twoelectrode voltage clamp measurements, in contrast to the patch
clamp measurements used previously, could not reliably resolve
current changes below 10%. in our hands, however, l-655,708 was a
highly potent but very weak partial agonist at alpha3beta3gamma2 receptors
(ec50 10 ± 3 nm, stimulation to 126 ± 4% of control current), in
contrast to previous data (atack et al., 2006) where this compound
exhibited a very weak  xxxd1422xxx  activity (reduction of gabainduced chloride ﬂux to 90%  xxxd1891xxx  mum concentration). different
experimental conditions might have contributed to this discrepancy.
interestingly, there is also a clear and previously noted (atack et al.,
2006) discrepancy between the afﬁnities of this compound in
receptor binding assays and its potencies in electrophysiological
studies. this is a frequently observed phenomenon probably due to
different experimental conditions between binding assays and

22

j. ramerstorfer et al. / european journal of pharmacology 636 (2010) 18–27

electrophysiological measurements. thus, a different measuring
temperature, equilibrium binding conditions vs. acute effects on
receptors, afﬁnity for the benzodiazepine binding site vs. measuring
multiple effects of the drug possibly caused by additional interactions with other sites could have contributed to this discrepancy.
the latter conclusion is supported by the very ﬂat dose–response
curve of this compound (fig. 4b, atack et al., 2006) suggesting
interaction with several binding sites. finally, in extension of
previous results we here demonstrated that this compound
enhanced gaba-induced chloride ﬂux in alpha4beta3gamma2 and alpha6beta3gamma2
receptors up to 224 ± 15% and 199 ± 31% with ec50's of 168 ± 71 nm
and n470 nm, respectively.
we also investigated three different beta-carbolines. the beta-carboline
 xxxd1422xxx  dmcm exhibited a biphasic effect (fig. 4c). at
concentrations up to 1 mum it reduced gaba-induced chloride ﬂux in
alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2, alpha4beta3gamma2, or alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors (maximal
inhibition to 79 ± 11%, 54 ± 3%, 69 ± 1%, 88 ± 2%, or 52 ± 5%, respectively, table 1) (dawson et al., 2006).  xxxd1891xxx  mum, however, it stimulated
gaba-induced chloride ﬂux in these receptors (dawson et al., 2006;
whittemore et al., 1996). in alpha6beta3gamma2 receptors, however, dmcm did
not reduce gaba-induced currents but strongly enhanced the
chloride ﬂux to 189 ± 21% at 1 µm and to 353 ± 22%  xxxd1891xxx  µm
concentrations.
in contrast, the beta-carboline  xxxd1422xxx  fg7142 (fig. 4d)
inhibited gaba-induced chloride ﬂux at 1 mum and 10 mum concentration (strongest effect: 88 ± 5%, 91 ± 2% or 84 ± 1% of control current,
for alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2 or alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors, respectively; table 1).
although there seemed also to be an inhibition at alpha2beta3gamma2 receptors,
the reduction was not signiﬁcant. this compound did not signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence alpha4beta3gamma2 or alpha6beta3gamma2 receptors. the stronger effects seen in
previous reports probably were due to the different experimental
conditions used (dawson et al., 2006; taylor et al., 1988).
finally, the beta-carboline abecarnil (fig. 4e) dose-dependently stimulated gaba ec3 in each receptor investigated. the rank order of stimulation
was alpha1beta3gamma2nalpha3beta3gamma2nalpha2beta3gamma2nalpha4beta3gamma2nalpha5beta3gamma2nalpha6beta3gamma2 receptors
achieving 640±157%, 480±100%, 353±62%, 279±81%, 232±38% and
218±13% of control currents  xxxd1891xxx  mum concentrations, respectively
(table 1). the dose–response curves were ﬂat, indicating an interaction
with more than one binding site at gabaa receptors. to the best of our
knowledge (atack, 2003; hadingham et al., 1996) no systematic
investigation on the effects of this compound on various receptor subtypes
seems to have been published.

are normalized to a control gaba current at ec3. data points represent means ± sem
from at least 3 oocytes derived from ≥2 batches.

to investigate the inﬂuence of the gamma2f77i mutation on the potency of
gaba for enhancing chloride ion ﬂux, recombinant receptors composed of
 xxxg830xxx ,  xxxg831xxx ,  xxxg832xxx ,  xxxg833xxx ,  xxxg834xxx , or  xxxg835xxx , plus  xxxg838xxx  subunits and either wt- xxxg842xxx  or gamma2f77i
subunits were investigated for gaba-induced currents. as shown in fig. 5,
gaba dose-dependently stimulated chloride ion ﬂux in all receptors
investigated. gaba was most potent for stimulating chloride ﬂux in
receptors composed of alpha5beta3gamma2 (ec50 of 8 ± 0.4 mum) followed by
receptors composed of alpha6beta3gamma2 (ec50 of 15±2 µm), alpha2beta3gamma2 (ec50 of
19±3 mum), alpha4beta3gamma2 (ec50 of 20±5 µm), alpha1beta3gamma2 (ec50 of 47±5 mum)
and alpha3beta3gamma2 (ec50 of 79±5 mum) (fig. 5a).
in the presence of the point mutations gamma2f77i the ec50 of gaba was
changed from 8±0.4 mum to 17±3 mum, from 15±2 mum to 18±6 mum, from
19±3 mum to 35±3 mum, from 20±5 mum to 15±2 mum, from 47±5 mum to
67±6 mum, from 79±5 mum to 94±4 mum, for alpha5beta3gamma2f77i, alpha6beta3gamma2f77i,
alpha2beta3gamma2f77i, alpha4beta3gamma2f77i, alpha1beta3gamma2f77i, or alpha3beta3gamma2f77i receptors,
respectively (fig. 5b).
interestingly, the gaba dose–response curve for alpha4beta3gamma2, alpha6beta3gamma2,
and alpha2beta3gamma2f77i, alpha4beta3gamma2f77i, alpha5beta3gamma2f77i and alpha6beta3gamma2f77i receptors were more ﬂat than the other curves (see hill coefﬁcients in
legend to fig. 5). this possibly indicates that the  xxxg842xxx  subunit in alpha4beta3gamma2

receptors (baumann et al., 2003; baur and sigel, 2005; hadley and
amin, 2007). presumably, the gaba site involving the  xxxg216xxx 
neighbouring the  xxxg842xxx  or gamma2f77i subunit is more strongly inﬂuenced by
these subunits than the other gaba binding site with a more distant
location to the  xxxg218xxx .
3.3. the point mutation gamma2f77i eliminates the action of several
benzodiazepine binding site ligands on different receptor subtypes over
a wide concentration range
in gaba a receptors containing the gamma2f77i mutation the
potency of diazepam for stimulation of gaba-induced chloride
ﬂux was reduced (fig. 3f). thus, the ec50 of diazepam increased
from 63 ± 11 nm to 110 ± 11 nm, from 34 ± 2 nm to 120 ± 8 nm,
from 93 ± 7 nm to 143 ± 31 nm or from 32 ± 4 nm to 78 ± 20 nm
for alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2 or alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors, respectively
(table 1). similarly, the efﬁcacy of diazepam for enhancing gaba
ec3 was signiﬁcantly reduced in receptors containing the gamma2f77i
mutation (figs. 2b, 3f). it changed from 324 ± 22% to 229 ± 26%,
from 532 ± 20% to 278 ± 6%, from 738 ± 36% to 272 ± 36% and
from 321 ± 14% to 154 ± 2%, for alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2 or
alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors, respectively (table 1).
the effects of the gamma2f77i mutation were even more extreme for
zolpidem (fig. 3g), zopiclone (fig. 3h), cl218872 (fig. 3i), and the
imidazobenzodiazepine l-655,708 (fig. 4g). here this point mutation
completely eliminated the ability of these drugs to modulate gaba
ec3 up to a concentration of 1 mum in all receptors investigated. at a
10 mum concentration, zolpidem, zopiclone and cl218872 exhibited a
quite weak 20–40% stimulation of gaba-induced chloride ﬂux in
some receptors. the effects of the two beta-carboline inverse agonists

were also drastically changed. the  xxxd1422xxx  effect of dmcm was
completely eliminated in all receptors investigated up to a concentration of 1 mum, whereas the strong agonist effect of dmcm above
1 mum was not much inﬂuenced in receptors containing the gamma2f77i
subunit. the partial  xxxd1422xxx  effect of fg7142 was converted
into a very weak partial agonist effect in the respective mutated
receptors.
the effects of this point mutation on the action of the imidazobenzodiazepines bretazenil (fig. 3j) and ro15-1788 (fig. 4f) and the
beta-carboline abecarnil (fig. 4j) were more complex. whereas these
compounds were inactive in the mutated receptors up to a
concentration of 100 nm, at higher concentrations these drugs could
stimulate gaba ec3 in at least some of the receptor subtypes
investigated.
4. discussion
in the present study we for the ﬁrst time provide dose–response
curves under comparable conditions for 10 benzodiazepine site
ligands from 6 different structural classes for modulation of gabainduced chloride ﬂux in recombinant alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2,
alpha4beta3gamma2, alpha5beta3gamma2 and alpha6beta3gamma2 receptors. in addition, we evaluated
the effect of the point mutation gamma2f77i on the dose–response curves
of these drugs in individual gabaa receptor subtypes.
4.1. changes in gaba potency indicate the formation of receptors
containing the gamma2f77i subunit
most of the receptors containing the gamma2f77i subunit exhibited a
reduced potency of gaba for activation of chloride currents as
compared to their respective wild-type receptor. since gaba is
mediating its effect by binding to the two beta + alpha-interfaces (ernst et
al., 2003) it is surprising that gaba potency is changed by a mutation
in the  xxxg218xxx . but this effect is in line with the previous observation
that the presence of a  xxxg218xxx  reduced the potency of gaba for
stimulating chloride ﬂux in all receptor subtypes investigated
(baburin et al., 2008; hadley and amin, 2007; whittemore et al.,
1996; ramerstorfer and sieghart, unpublished). a change in the
structure of the  xxxg842xxx  subunit thus might have further reduced the
potency of gaba.
the lower potency of gaba at receptors containing the gamma2f77i
mutation as opposed to the higher potency of gaba in gabaa receptors
containing no  xxxg218xxx , indicate that receptors containing the mutated
 xxxg842xxx  subunit were actually formed under the experimental conditions used.
this conclusion is supported by the ﬁnding that the maximal gabainduced currents measured in  xxxg830xxx –6beta3gamma2f77i injected xenopus oocytes
were in the range of the respective wild-type receptors and of gabainduced currents published previously (see legend to fig. 5) (hadley and
amin, 2007; whittemore et al., 1996) and were signiﬁcantly larger than
those measured in receptors composed of alpha and beta subunits, only
(ramerstorfer and sieghart, unpublished results). furthermore, 10 mum of
zn2+ reduced gaba-induced chloride ﬂux in alpha1beta3 receptors to 5.5±1%,
whereas this concentration reduced gaba-induced chloride ﬂux in
alpha1beta3gamma2 or alpha1beta3gamma2f77i receptors to 70.3±3% or 75.4±3%, respectively
(means±sem, n=4; experiments not shown). changes in the efﬁcacy of
benzodiazepine site ligands in receptors containing this mutation thus
cannot be explained by a reduced formation of receptors containing the
gamma2f77i subunit.
4.2. the point mutation gamma2f77i reduces potency and efﬁcacy of several
benzodiazepine site ligands
the point mutation gamma2f77i caused only a relatively small change in
the potency of diazepam for stimulation of gaba-induced chloride
ﬂux. this is in agreement with receptor binding studies that indicate
only a small change in the afﬁnity of diazepam for these receptors

25

(ogris et al., 2004). the maximal stimulation of the gaba-induced
chloride ﬂux by diazepam, however, was drastically reduced in the
mutated receptors, supporting the conclusion that the residue gamma2f77
is at least as important for the transduction of the diazepam effect as
for binding of this compound to the benzodiazepine binding site.
in contrast, the point mutation gamma2f77i nearly completely eliminated the effect of zolpidem on each receptor investigated, as
expected from the absence of electrophysiological and behavioural
effects of this compound in mice containing the point mutation
gamma2f77i (cope et al., 2005, 2004; wulff et al., 2007).
as with zolpidem, the effects of the sedative–hypnotic compound
zopiclone, the triazolopyridazine cl218872, or the imidazobenzodiazepine l-655,708 were more or less completely eliminated in all
mutated receptor subtypes investigated, in agreement with an
approximately 300-fold, 100-fold, 900-fold and n1000-fold shift in
afﬁnity of these compounds, respectively, for gabaa receptors of mice
containing the point mutation gamma2f77i (ogris et al., 2004). the effects
of some of these compounds  xxxd1891xxx  mum concentration are probably too
weak to be of importance in behavioural studies.
similarly, the  xxxd1422xxx  effect of dmcm was completely
eliminated, whereas the agonistic effect at concentrations above 1 mum
was not drastically changed in gabaa receptors containing the gamma2f77i
mutation. the very weak agonistic effect of dmcm at 1 mum and the
stronger agonistic effect  xxxd1891xxx  mum concentration explain the in vivo
ﬁnding that dmcm did not produce convulsions but produced even
modest anxiolytic effects in gamma2f77i mice (leppa et al., 2005). in gabaa
receptors containing the gamma2f77i mutation the  xxxd1422xxx  effects
of fg7142 were converted to very weak partial agonistic effects
resulting in a maximum stimulation of the gaba-induced current to
126 ± 6%. in contrast, the effects of the imidazobenzodiazepines ro151788 or bretazenil or of the beta-carboline abecarnil were not completely
eliminated in some receptors above a concentration of 1 mum,
suggesting a differential effect of the gamma2f77i mutation for these
compounds in different receptor subtypes.
4.3. use of benzodiazepine site ligands in the gamma2f77i-swap mouse model
the point mutation gamma2f77i, thus, completely eliminated the ability
of zolpidem, zopiclone, cl218872, or the imidazobenzodiazepine l655,708, to enhance gaba ec3 up to a concentration of 1 mum in all
receptors investigated. similarly, the inverse agonistic effects of the betacarbolines dmcm and fg7142 were completely eliminated by this
mutation. although recombinant receptors from rat have been used in
the present study, the benzodiazepine binding site of gabaa receptors
seems to be highly conserved in different species as indicated by
similar afﬁnities and efﬁcacies of various ligands in different species
and different recombinant receptors (atack et al., 2009; sieghart et al.,
1985). although we cannot exclude differences in the efﬁcacies of
benzodiazepine site ligands in individual gabaa receptor subtypes in
rat and mouse, this seems not very likely. these compounds therefore
are prime candidates to be used in the loxgamma2f77i-swap mouse model,
in which the gamma2f77i subunit is replaced by the egfp-tagged wild-type
 xxxg842xxx  subunit in certain neurons in speciﬁc brain regions, only (wulff et
al., 2007). these compounds will have lost their wild-type efﬁcacy in
the brain of the loxgamma2f77i mice as has been demonstrated for
zolpidem (cope et al., 2005, 2004) and dmcm (leppa et al., 2005)
already, and will have restored this efﬁcacy only in neurons in which
the point mutated  xxxg842xxx  subunit was replaced by the egfp-tagged wildtype  xxxg842xxx  subunit. zopiclone is a strong agonist at alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2,
alpha3beta3gamma2 and alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors, whereas dmcm is an  xxxd1422xxx 
at these receptors. although these compounds are not subtype
selective, they can be used to reduce or enhance the electrical activity
of neurons in speciﬁc brain areas in our loxgamma2f77i-swap mouse
model, respectively, by modulating the main receptors involved in the
actions of classical benzodiazepines. this will allow to study the
function of these cells in various behavioural parameters.

whereas zopiclone at 1 mum concentration is an equally strong
agonist at alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2 and alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors,
zolpidem is only an agonist at alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, and alpha3beta3gamma2
receptors. these compounds do not modulate alpha4beta3gamma2 and alpha6beta3gamma2
receptors. electrophysiological or behavioural effects that can be
elicited by zopiclone but not by zolpidem will thus provide
information on effects mediated via alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors.
the imidazobenzodiazepine ro15-1788 (ﬂumazenil) is an antagonist at alpha1beta3gamma2 and alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors, but is a weak partial agonist,
at alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2, alpha4beta3gamma2, and alpha6beta3gamma2 receptors. so this
compound is not a pure antagonist at all gabaa receptors, as widely
assumed, explaining previous reports on some effects of this drug in
animals and man (nutt, 1983; skerritt and macdonald, 1983; vellucci
and webster, 1983). at 100 nm concentrations, this compound will
more or less exclusively stimulate the action of gaba at alpha2beta3gamma2,
alpha3beta3gamma2 and alpha4beta3gamma2 receptors in the forebrain. although ﬂumazenil
exhibits only a weak efﬁcacy, any effect observed with this drug can
thus be contributed to these receptor subtypes.
although the receptor subtype-selectivity of the compounds
investigated is limited, there is the hope that other compounds from
the structural classes of imidazobenzodiazepines, imidazopyridines,
beta-carbolines, triazolopyridazines or cyclopyrrolones could be developed with a more receptor subtype-selective proﬁle. these compounds then not only could be used to investigate the function of the
respective receptor subtypes in the brain of wild-type mice, but also in
individual cell types in our loxgamma2f77i-swap mouse model. such
compounds also will have an interesting spectrum of action in man
and can be developed for a possible clinical application.
