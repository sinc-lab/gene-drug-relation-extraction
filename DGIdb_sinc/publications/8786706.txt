introduction
ergot alkaloids induce a wide range of physiological effects both in the cns and peripheral
tissues (1). the ability of these agents to interact simultaneously
with various monoamine
receptors in the brain (1,2) complicates the identification of particular mechanisms of action
underlying their specific pharmacological effects. in apparent contrast, the metabolic effects of
dihydroergocryptine,
bromocriptine and other ergot derivatives in the liver were attributed to the
fact that these drugs are high affinity ligands of a-adrenoreceptors,
abundant on the liver cells
membranes (3,4,5). however, the changes in metabolism induced by bromocriptine in obese
hyperinsulinemic
syrian hamster (6,7) imply the possibility of alternative mechanisms of action
of ergot derivatives in the hamster liver.

non-adrenerglc binding of ergot alkaloids

vol. 58, no. 12,19!36

to explore the nature of such mechanisms we have studied the effect of bromocriptine on the
binding of dopamine and  xxxg1108xxx  ligands as well as the binding of bromocriptine
analog [3h] dihydroergocryptine
to a crude membrane fraction from hamster liver. obtained
results strongly support the old hypothesis of a “direct site of action” (1, 8) of ergots (at least in
the liver) unassociated with any known monoamine receptor site, in addition to the effects
mediated by liver a,/az adrenoreceptors (3,4,5).
methods
membrane preparation. adult male ( 220 - 240 g) and female ( 180 - 210 g) syrian hamsters
were purchased from simonsen laboratories inc. ( gilroy, ca) and were housed at 4 per cage
under a 14 h light: 10 h dark period with food and water ad libitum. male sprague dawley rats
(250 - 300 g) obtained from harlan sprague dawley (indianapolis, in) were maintained on 12 h
daily photoperiod with free access to food and water. immediately after the decapitation the
livers were removed and placed on ice. frozen livers of 20 weeks old syrian hamsters (harlan
sprague dawley, indianapolis, in) were thawed before use. samples of 500 mg tissue were
dissected on ice, weighed and homogenized (virtis homogenizer, 30 set at high speed) in 30 vol
of ice  xxxd1861xxx  buffer: 50 mm tris-hcl, 2 mm edta, 2 mm egta, 1 mm dtt, 2.5
pg/ml leupeptine, 2.5 pg/ml pepstatin, 0.5% dmso, ph 7.4. the homogenates were centrifuged
(35,000 g, 2°c 20 min) and the pellets obtained were washed with rehomogenization in the fresh
buffer 4 times. the crude membrane fractions obtained after the last centrifugation were frozen at
-30°c. for binding analysis, the frozen crude membranes were thawed and homogenized in 30
vol of ice-cold 50 mm tris-hcl, 0.1 %  xxxd228xxx , ph 7.4. homogenates were centifuged as
described above and the pellets were resuspended in appropriate ice-cold incubation buffer. the
protein concentration was determined by micro bca assay (pierce, rockford il).
binding of 5-ht,,.. and djd, receptmlipands.
[3h] 8-oh-dpat ( 235 ci/mmol, amersham)
was used at a concentration of 0.2 nm for identifying 5-ht,, receptors, [3h] n-0437 (100
ci/mmol, amersham) was used at 0.5 nm for identifying dopamine d, receptors, and [3h]
spiperone (105 ci/mmol, amersham) at a concentration of 0.5 nm was used for d,/d, receptors.
incubation conditions were as described (2,9), samples (5 mg of initial tissue wet weight per ml)
were incubated in 1 ml of 50 mm tris-hcl, 150 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl,, 0.1%
 xxxd228xxx , ph 7.4 at room temperature for 45 min. nonspecific binding for 5-ht,, receptors
was determined with 50 pm of serotonin, and for d,/d, receptors with 50 pm of (+)butaclamol.
all binding assays were evaluated in preliminary experiments with brain crude membrane
fraction; the results were comparable to the published data (2,9).

the
following incubation buffer was used to assay [3h] dec binding: 50 mm tris, 1 mm dtt, 100
um  xxxd2914xxx , 0.5% dmso, 0.1%  xxxd228xxx , hcl to ph 7.4 (at 20°c).  xxxd2914xxx  was
included in the incubation buffer to eliminate an interaction of [3h] dec with a,- and a,
adrenoreceptors, abundant in the liver and known to have high affinity for ergot derivatives
(2,3,4,5). the samples containing membrane suspension, corresponding to 1 mg of initial tissue
weight (unless otherwise indicated), were incubated with 3 nm of [‘hi dihydro-a-ergocryptine
{9,10-3h(n), 20.3 ci/mmol, du pont} during 30 min at 20°c in 1 ml of incubation buffer with
various additives. for saturation binding analysis 6 concentrations of radioligand in the range 0.2
- 30 nm were used. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 20 pm of
bromocriptine. total binding, nonspecific binding and binding in the presence of the various
drugs were determined in triplicate. icso were determined with at least 5 drug concentrations.

orocedure. samples were incubated in 24 well, flat bottom tissue culture plates
(falcon 3047, bencton dickinson, lincoln park, nj) on a radial shaker (200 rotations per
minute). after incubation the membranes with bound radioactivity were harvested under suction
onto unifilter-24 well gf/b plates ( packard, meriden, ct) presoaked with the filtration buffer
(see below) on a filtermate cell harvester (packard, meriden, ct). to this end 2 ml of ice-cold
filtration buffer were added to each well, followed immediately by the filtration step and three
washings with 3 ml of the same buffer. the filtration buffer for 5-htia and d,/d, receptors was
50 mm tris-hci, 150 mm naci, 0.1%  xxxd228xxx , ph 7.4. for the [3h] doc binding assay,
the filtration buffer was: 50 mm tris, 150 mm nacl, 0.1%  xxxd228xxx , 1 mm dtt, 10 um
 xxxd2914xxx , 1 um bromocriptine, 0.5% bsa, hci to ph 7.4 (at 20°c). unifilter plates were
dried for 15 min, supplemented with 0.2 ml/well of scintillation cocktail microscint-20 (packard,
meriden, ct) and the retained radioactivity was determined on microplate scintillation counter.
specific binding values were generated by the substraction of nonspecific binding from the total
binding. the ic,, values and binding parameters were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis
with the aid of prism software (graphpad, san diego, ca). chemicals were from sigma, drugs
from rbi.

the specific binding of i3hl8-oh-dpat
to
the crude liver membrane fraction was below the level of detection at tissue concentration of 5

of 0.5 nm [3h] spiperone or 0.5 nm [‘hi n-0437 to crude liver membranes was in the detectable
range ( 70 % and 55% of total binding) and corresponded to 5.8 + 1.4 pmol/g tissue and 3.2 t
0.5 pmol/g tissue ( m + s.e.m., n = 3) respectively. (+)butaclamol, sulpiride and haloperidol
inhibited less than 50% of specific binding of both ligands at 1 fm, and dopamine was not
effective at 100 pm. bromocriptine did not affect the specific binding of [3h] n-0437 to crude
liver membranes up to 1 um (the highest concentration used ) and inhibited specific binding of
[3h] spiperone by less than 30 % at 1 pm.

specific binding of 3 nm [3h] dec to
male hamster crude liver membrane fraction assayed in the presence of 100 pm of  xxxd2914xxx 
corresponded to 235 + 31 pmol/g tissue
(m + s.e.m., n = 8). the nonspecific binding
represented less than 6% of the total binding. the optimal ph level was found to be between 7.4
- 7.6; specific r3h] dec binding decreased by 10 - 15 % at ph 8 and by 60% at ph 6.5. no
effect of nacl up to 150 mm,  xxxg2125xxx , up to 5 mm, mgci, up to 5 mm or edta up to 5 mm
(highest concentrations used ) on [3h] dec specific binding was detected. in contrast 5 mm
mncl, and 5 mm cocl, decreased specific binding by 25 % and 45 % respectively. no changes
in [3h] dec specific binding was detected in the presence of 1 mm of atp or gtp. dtt (1
mm) elevated specific binding
by 5 - 10% in freshly prepared membranes, whereas in
membrane suspension kept on ice for two hours the stimulatory effect increased up to 25 - 40%.
accordingly dtt was incorporated in the incubation buffer. specific binding of [3h] dec was
dose dependently inhibited by n-ethylmalemide
with ic,, = 1.2 + 0.2 mm, at 5 mm (highest

scatchard plots of [3h] dihydro-a-ergocryptine saturation binding isotherms to crude

of  xxxd2914xxx . data were obtained from the saturation binding analysis of
membrane suspensions prepared and assayed simultaneously form two male
(black symbols) and two female (empty symbols) syrian hamsters. binding
parameters were determined with six concentrations of radioactive ligand in the
range of 0.2 - 30 nm in triplicate for each tissue sample in the presence of 100 pm
of  xxxd2914xxx . nonspecific binding was determined for each tissue sample and
bromocriptine. no differences in the
radioligand concentration with 20 pm
nonspecific binding values between different tissue samples were detected. similar
data were obtained in two additional independent experiments, each with two male
and female syrian hamsters.

detection of the method used ( 2 pmol/g of initial tissue weight). the specific binding of [‘h]
dec (3 nm) to crude membrane fraction from rat liver in the presence of 100 pm of
 xxxd2914xxx  corresponded to 11 2 3 pmol/g tissue ( about 5 % of the level in the hamster liver).
nonlinear regression analysis of [3h] dec binding to male hamster crude liver membrane
fraction in the presence of 100 pm of  xxxd2914xxx  revealed the presence of a single population
of binding sites (fig.2) with i(d = 3,s + 0.9 nm and b,, = 675 2 130 pmol/g tissue (mean +
s.e.m., n = 6). the comparison of binding parameters in crude liver membrane fractions
prepared simultaneously from the liver of male and female hamster of the same age (6 months)
demonstrated a significantly higher concentration of [‘hi dec binding sites in female (fig.3).
the mean b,,, values in membranes isolated from female hamster corresponded to 1025 of: 190
pmol/g ( m l s.e.m., n = 6) or 45 - 55% higher comparing to the membranes obtained from the
male hamster ( p 4 0.01, student’s t-test). comparison of the binding in the crude membrane
fraction isolated from the frozen specimen of liver of 20 weeks old hamsters (two males and two
females) also shows 45 - 50 % higher abundance of [3h] dec binding sites in the female animal
liver. at the same time i$ values for the [3h] dec binding to membrane fraction from female
hamster liver (4.4 2 1.2 nm, mean 2 s.e.m., n = 6) were not statistically different from the
values, obtained for the membranes from the male hamster liver.

incubations were performed as described above in the presence of 5 - 6
concentrations of each ligand in the range 1 nm - 10 pm in triplicates. concentration of
[3h] dec was 3 nm and the concentration of membrane suspension corresponded to 1
mg of tissue per ml. each value is mean + s.e.m. from 2 - 3 independent experiments.

data obtained in the inhibitory analysis of [3h] dec binding to crude membrane fraction from
hamster liver are presented in the table. the following agents were found to have ic,,, values
more than 10 pm: adrenaline,  xxxd3000xxx , wb-4101, yohimbine, clonidine, idazoxan,  xxxd123xxx ,
dopamine, (-)sulpiride, (k) ppht, quinelorane, haloperidol, quinpirole, spiperone, sch 12679,

as indicated in the
table butaclamol inhibited the [3h] dec specific binding in stereoselective way with (+)
stereoisomer being about 7 times more potent than (-) stereoisomer.

to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate specific binding sites for [3h]
dec in the hamster liver, which are different from a,/a2 adrenoreceptors as well as from d2 and
5-ht,* receptors. jackson et al. (2) have shown that, along with dopamine d, and a,/a,
adrenoreceptors, the other monoamine receptors possessing high affinity for bromocriptine in the
brain are dopamine ds and serotonin 5-ht,, receptors. in an attempt to identify possible sites of
action of ergot alkaloids not identical to a, and a, adrenoreceptors in the hamster liver, we have
studied the abundance of d, , d, receptors and 5-i-itia receptors in the crude fraction of liver
membranes. although we were able to reveal specific binding sites of [3h] spiperone as well as

vol. 58, no. 12, 19%

non-adrenergic binding of ergot alkaloids

pli-247

of [3h] n-0437 in this preparation, these sites apparently do not correspond to dt or d, receptors.
indeed, dopamine did not affect their binding at concentrations up to 100 pm, and the affinities
of 3 potent antagonists were at least three orders of magnitude below the level expected in the
case of d, /d, receptors ( 10).
the affinity of bromocriptine for the d, receptor is in the micromolar range (2, io), therefore the
presence of d, binding sites were not studied in the present work. it should be mentioned, that
nassar et al. (11) have described high affinity binding of [‘“cl dopamine to rat liver membranes.
since no inhibitory analysis data are available, it is difficult to attribute these binding sites to the
d, receptor. the binding of the 5-ht,, receptor ligand [3h] 8-oh-dpat to hamster crude liver
membranes was below the level of detection. assuming the high specific activity (235 ci/mmol)
and high affinity of this ligand for the 5-ht,, receptor (io), we speculate that, even if these
receptors are present in the hamster liver, their content is insufficient to significantly contribute
to the effects of ergot derivatives on liver functions. the observation that serotonin, 8-oh-dpat
and nan-90 do not inhibit specific [3h] dec binding to crude liver membranes
in
concentrations up to 10 pm further supports this preposition. assuming the low affinity of
bromocriptine for p-adrenoreceptors (2), and the low content of p-adrenoreceptors
in the liver
tissue (12), one may surmise that in the hamster liver, the monoaminergic
effects of ergot
derivatives are mediated primarily by a adrenoreceptors.
considering the data discussed above, the [3h] dec binding sites identified in the presence of
100 pm of  xxxd2914xxx  (virtually eliminating the possibility of binding to cc adrenoreceptors)
are probably not related to any known monoamine receptors. the data of inhibitory analysis,
indicating that micromolar concentrations of the ligands for p-adreno, d,, d1, d,, 5-ht,,,5-httc,
5-ht,, h, and h, receptors as well as of imidazoline binding site does not inhibit the [‘hi dec
binding, support this hypothesis.
among the ergot alkaloids studied (table) only those with a tricyclic peptide moiety have high
affinity for non-monoamine
r3h] dec binding sites. the compounds with affinity in the low
micromolar range are represented by the calcium channel blockers,  xxxd2718xxx  and  xxxd2737xxx ,
ligand of peripheral benzodiazepine
receptors pk 11195, and d, antagonists butaclamol and
 xxxd1927xxx . the observation that (+)butaclamol has 7 fold higher affinity for the [3h] dec
specific binding comparing to (-) butaclamol indicates that the binding sites are stereoselective.
in conclusion, specific non-monoamine
binding sites for ergot alkaloids exhibiting significant
gender differences in b,, value were demonstrated in the hamster liver. the nature of the [‘hi
dec binding sites remains obscure and currently may be attributed to the membrane protein (as
indicated by the presence of sh groups) with preferable localization in the liver. one can
speculate that the described binding sites may be associated with a membrane transporter,
membrane channels or one of membrane bound metabolic enzymes, for example, cytochromes
(13). at the same time, the stereospecific nature of the binding, selective localization in the liver
and significant gender and species differences suggest that [‘hi dec binding sites have
physiological function and may be involved in the realization of pharmacological
effects of
bromocriptine and other ergot derivatives. further characterization of the subcellular localization,
biochemical properties, and neuroendocrine
regulations of these binding sites is warranted to
examine this possibility.
