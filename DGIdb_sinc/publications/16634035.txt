objective: our objective was to study in vivo biological effects of natalizumab on immune cell phenotype and function in
multiple sclerosis (ms) patients.
methods: blood was obtained before and after serial monthly natalizumab infusions to track functional expression of  xxxg1203xxx  and
migratory capacity of immune cells. the impact of infusion on activation thresholds of immune cells was evaluated.
results: preinfusion  xxxg1203xxx  expression differed across immune cell subsets. natalizumab significantly, albeit partially, diminished
 xxxg1203xxx  expression on circulating immune cells. cell subsets were differentially affected. treatment significantly decreased migratory capacity of immune cells, correlating well with changes in  xxxg1203xxx  expression. effects of a single dose were not saturating
and did not persist through the monthly dose interval. infusion effect varied across patients but was remarkably stable in
individual patients, over multiple infusions. treatment significantly modulated proliferative responses of immune cells.
interpretation: to our knowledge, we provide first proof of concept that natalizumab diminishes migratory capacity of immune
cells. our prospective study further shows that effects of therapy likely (1) differ for distinct immune cell subsets, (2) are not
sustained over current dose interval, (3) have unique profiles in individual patients, and (4) include modulation of activation
threshold of immune cells. monitoring these parameters could be relevant to ongoing safety and efficacy considerations.

natalizumab (tysabri, biogen idec inc., cambridge, ma
and elan pharmaceuticals, inc., san diego, ca), a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the ␣4integrin of the adhesion molecule  xxxg1203xxx , was approved
by the food and drug administration in november
2004 for treatment of relapsing-remitting ms based on
promising phase ii1 and 1-year efficacy data from two
phase iii clinical trials.2 the drug was voluntarily withdrawn and the trials stopped in february 2005 when two
treated ms patients (and later a crohn’s disease patient)
were found to develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml), a rare and potentially fatal central
nervous system (cns) reactivation of the jc virus.3,4
the strong hope in the ms community that natalizumab will be reintroduced is mitigated by the need to
identify who may benefit most from therapy and who
may be at particular risk for complications such as pml.
these outcomes are likely to relate to the effects of the
drug on particular immune cell subsets. although inhibition of t-cell trafficking has been thought to underlie

both drug efficacy and toxicity,5,6 the impact on other
cell subsets may be quite relevant.7 furthermore, animal
model studies suggest that the effects of  xxxg1203xxx  inhibition may extend beyond trafficking and also impact immune cell activation.8,9 nonetheless, surprisingly little is
known about the in vivo biological effects of natalizumab on immune cell responses in treated patients.
here, we prospectively studied the impact of serial natalizumab infusions on immune cell phenotype and functional responses in ms patients. we provide the first biological proof of concept that natalizumab diminishes
functional ␣4-integrin expression and migratory capacity
of immune cells and identify several unexpected response
parameters that may prove to be relevant to both the efficacy and safety profile of natalizumab in patients.

talizumab clinical trial program, and normal volunteers were
recruited after institutional review board approval at the hopital charles-lemoyne and the montreal neurological hospital, quebec, canada. all patients were studied while
treated with the standard 300mg monthly intravenous regimen of natalizumab. for each patient, blood samples were
collected just before and 1.5 hours after each treatment (pretreatment and postinfusion, respectively), based on published
pharmacokinetic data.11 a prospective patient cohort (n ⫽
8) was studied up to five times over a 13-month period.

triplicate. at the indicated times, proliferation was assessed as
18-hour tritiated thymidine uptake (1␮ci; icn biochemicals, mississauga, ontario, canada) using a beta scintillation
counter. the effect of in vivo infusion of anti– xxxg1203xxx  on
pbmc proliferation was evaluated using the above approach
to compare in parallel responses of pbmc obtained from
patients, before and after natalizumab infusion. in addition,
the proliferative responses of normal pbmc were evaluated
upon the addition, in parallel, of preinfusion or postinfusion
serum from treated patients (dilutions of 1:15 or 1:5 in
rpmi-1640).

cell isolation and migration assays
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were isolated
from heparinized blood samples using  xxxd3253xxx -paque (amersham biosciences, uppsala sweden). migration assays were
conducted blindly on preinfusion and postinfusion pbmcs
in parallel, using boyden chambers, as previously described.12 in this system,  xxxg1203xxx  on immune cells is known
to contribute to migration by interacting with the cs-1 fragment of fibronectin, implicated as one of the functional
binding partners of  xxxg1203xxx  in migration across human brain
endothelial cells.7,13 in brief, 5␮m chambers were precoated
with 50␮g/ml fibronectin (bd pharmingen, bedford, ma)
and inserted into one well of a 24-well plate. ex vivo isolated
pbmcs (1 ⫻ 106) were added to the top compartment in
500␮l of rpmi-1640 supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum. after 1 hour, cells were collected from the bottom
compartment and counted. for blocking experiments, monoclonal mouse anti–human  xxxg1203xxx  or control mouse igg1
were added (both at 15␮g/ml; r&d systems, minneapolis,
mn).

flow cytometry
three-color staining was performed as previously described7
by incubating whole blood with saturating amounts of directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies noted below (all
from bd pharmingen) for 30 minutes at 4°c in the dark.
isotype-matched antibodies were used as negative controls
(bd pharmingen). red blood cells were lysed using facs
lysing solution (bd biosciences, mississauga, canada) for
10 minutes at room temperature. stained cells then were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline and acquired with a
bd facscan (becton dickinson). analysis of mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) of ␣4-integrin ( xxxg1203xxx ) on immune
cell subsets was performed by a blinded operator with the
flowjo software (treestar, ashland, or). antibodies targeted  xxxg1203xxx ;  xxxg1205xxx  (lfa-1); cd3, cd4, and cd8 t
cells;  xxxg375xxx  b cells; cd14 monocytes; and memory markers
cd45ra/cd45 ro (t cells) and cd27 (b cells).

in vitro stimulation assays
total pbmcs were cultured at 37°c/5% co2 in 96-well
plates at 1 ⫻ 105 viable cells/well in rpmi-1640 supplemented with 100u/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 2mm
l-glutamine (invitrogen, la jolla, ca). effects of in vitro
anti– xxxg1203xxx  on pbmc proliferation were assessed by culturing pbmc in parallel either with a dose titration of anticd3 antibody alone ( xxxd2676xxx ; atcc, rockville, md) or
with the  xxxd2676xxx  as well as dose titrations of anti– xxxg1203xxx  or
mouse igg1 isotype control. each subcondition was done in

statistics
data from migration and facs assays comparing averages of
samples obtained before and after natalizumab infusions were
analyzed using the student’s paired t test. analysis between
cell phenotypes and mfi utilized analysis of variance
(anova) followed by fisher’s protected least significant
difference (plsd). p values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

results
we first confirmed that in vivo infusion of the standard dose of natalizumab (300mg iv) significantly decreased the migratory capacity of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmc) in patients with multiple
sclerosis (fig 1a; n ⫽ 24; p ⫽ 0.0001). the migration
of postinfusion pbmc could be further inhibited by
the addition of anti– xxxg1203xxx  antibody in vitro (see fig
1; p ⬍ 0.0001), suggesting that the in vivo infusion of
natalizumab did not fully block the functional expression of  xxxg1203xxx  on the surface of circulating immune
cells. we evaluated this using whole-blood flow cytometry to compare mfi of the ␣4-integrin ( xxxg1203xxx ) of
 xxxg1203xxx  on the surface of immune cells in preinfusion
and postinfusion samples.  xxxg1203xxx  mfi of circulating
immune cells was significantly, although only partially,
reduced after natalizumab treatment (see fig 1c; n ⫽
30; p ⬍ 0.0001). this effect was specific, because the
expression of  xxxg1205xxx  (the ␣-integrin of lfa-1) on the
same cells was not impacted by in vivo natalizumab. a
strong correlation (r ⫽ 0.6508; p ⫽ 0.0006) was seen
between the effects of natalizumab infusion on the
 xxxg1203xxx  ␣4-integrin surface expression and on the migratory capacity of the same immune cells (see fig
1d), reinforcing the functional relevance of the flow
cytometry measurement of ␣4-integrin expression.
both the efficacy and safety profiles of natalizumab
are likely to depend on which immune cell subsets are
most impacted by anti– xxxg1203xxx  therapy. this may be
influenced by the basal (preinfusion) expression of ␣4integrin on distinct subsets, as well as by the relative
decrease in surface expression after treatment. examination of immune cell subsets in the circulation of patients preinfusion demonstrated that  xxxg375xxx ⫹ b cells
and cd14⫹ monocytes expressed significantly higher
basal levels of ␣4-integrin compared with cd3⫹ t

cells (fig 2a; n ⫽ 30; p ⬍ 0.0001 for both). among t
cells, cd8⫹ cells expressed more than twice as much
␣4-integrin as did cd4⫹ t cells (see fig 2b; p ⫽
0.0002). consistent with a previous report,14 memory
(cd45ro⫹ra⫺) t cells expressed higher levels of the
␣4-integrin compared with naive (cd45ro-ra⫹) t
cells (see fig 2b; p ⫽ 0.0059). memory (cd27⫹) b
cells expressed significantly higher basal levels of ␣4integrin than did naive (cd27⫺) b cells ( p ⬍ 0.0001).
we next questioned the extent to which in vivo natalizumab treatment impacted the available ␣4-integrin on
the different immune cell subsets. although the absolute decrease in ␣4-integrin expression (absolute
change in mfi) was smaller for t cells compared with
b cells and monocytes (data not shown), the relative
impact of infusion (percent decrease in mfi) was
greatest for t cells (49%) compared with the b cells
(29%; p ⫽ 0.006) or monocytes (approximately 25%;
p ⫽ 0.0034). there were no differences in the relative
impact of natalizumab infusion on ␣4-integrin expres-

sion comparing cd4 to cd8 t cells, memory to naive
t cells or memory to naive b cells (data not shown).
we next asked whether the effect of a single standard natalizumab infusion (300mg iv) persisted until
the next infusion. ␣4-integrin surface expression on ex
vivo pbmcs was prospectively monitored in preinfusion and postinfusion samples from ms patients undergoing serial monthly infusions of natalizumab over
a 10-month period (see fig 2c, example of an individual patient plotted over time, and summary histogram
of n ⫽ 8 patients). we observed that the available surface expression of the ␣4-integrin was decreased by
each infusion, although this effect did not persist over
the 1-month dosing interval, because subsequent preinfusion levels tended to recover. the same transient
effect was seen at the level of individual cd3⫹,
 xxxg375xxx ⫹, and cd14⫹ cell subsets (data not shown),
and also at the functional level when serially studying
the migratory capacity of pbmc. specifically, we
found that the percentage of inhibition of migration

monocytes (cd14⫹) compared with t cells (cd3⫹). (b) baseline ␣4-integrin expression on t-cell and b-cell subsets. (c) the decreased ␣4-integrin expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells mediated by natalizumab infusion does not persist through the

averaged across patients was 26%, 34%, and 29%
around the first, second, and third study infusions, respectively. an interesting pattern was revealed when
looking at individual patient profiles over time (see fig
2d; data for four patients shown for ease of visualization). the magnitude of drug effect is depicted as the
ratio of  xxxg1203xxx  expression on pbmc postinfusion divided by the expression preinfusion, such that a value
of 1.0 reflects no drug effect on this measure and lower
fractions reflect greater drug effect. we found that the
magnitude of the infusion effect on the ␣4-integrin expression could vary significantly across patients but
tended to be quite similar within individual patients,
over multiple infusions as confirmed through month
13 of treatment (see fig 2d). this relatively consistent
effect of infusions in individual patients was also true
at the level of immune cells subsets (t cells, b cells,
and monocytes; data not shown).
in addition to its role in trafficking,  xxxg1203xxx  is also

recognized as potentially involved in costimulation of
t cells.14,15 to study the potential effects of natalizumab on human t cells, we first confirmed that in
vitro addition of anti– xxxg1203xxx  significantly modulated
the activation of normal human pbmc. at a relatively
low concentration (0.1␮g/ml), anti– xxxg1203xxx  significantly enhanced pbmc proliferation to  xxxd2676xxx 
( xxxd2676xxx ; fig 3a). increasing concentrations resulted in
successively lower enhancement of proliferation (see
fig 3b). similar to results from normal pbmc above,
in vitro anti– xxxg1203xxx  enhanced proliferation of pbmc
obtained from ms patients before natalizumab infusion, but this effect was abrogated in postinfusion
pbmc of the same patients (see fig 3c). we also
found that, compared with preinfusion serum, serum
obtained from patients after natalizumab infusion was
able to significantly enhance the anti–cd3-mediated
proliferation of normal pbmc (see fig 3d). we confirmed a similar costimulatory effect of anti– xxxg1203xxx  on

and major histocompatibility complex class ii–restricted responses across a broad range of t-cell specificities16,17 (see supplementary online figure a).
pbmc exhibited enhanced proliferation to ga also
when exposed to serum obtained from patients after
infusion with natalizumab, compared with preinfusion
serum from the same patients (data not shown). finally, we found that anti– xxxg1203xxx  could induce proliferative responses to a  xxxg1383xxx  (mbp) peptide pool that were not otherwise detectable in a
primary proliferation assay (see supplementary online
figure b).
discussion
to our knowledge, we provide the first biological proof
of concept of the expected effects of in vivo natalizumab on cell trafficking in ms patients, demonstrating that therapy diminishes the functional surface expression of the ␣4-integrin and the migratory capacity

of circulating immune cells. several of our findings,
however, were less expected.
although studies of anti– xxxg1203xxx  therapy have tended
to focus on targeting t cells,1,5,12,14 our preinfusion
studies demonstrate that basal levels of  xxxg1203xxx  are significantly higher on circulating b cells and monocytes
compared with t cells, reinforcing reports implicating
 xxxg1203xxx  in trafficking of these cell types across the blood
brain barrier endothelium.18,19 these findings also
point to potentially different effects of anti– xxxg1203xxx  on
these cells and their subsets. it is not known whether
such therapy will have a greater, or lesser, effect on the
trafficking of a cell expressing lower levels of  xxxg1203xxx .
on one hand, cells expressing lower levels of  xxxg1203xxx 
may be more affected by a given concentration of anti–
 xxxg1203xxx . on the other hand, lower levels of  xxxg1203xxx  expression may reflect a lesser reliance of particular cells
for  xxxg1203xxx  in trafficking. in the context of pml risk, it
is of interest to speculate on the particularly high levels
of  xxxg1203xxx  expressed on b cell subsets, because b cells
have been implicated as main carriers of jc virus in the
circulation and may represent a mode of transport of

the virus into the cns.7,20,21 similarly, the higher levels of  xxxg1203xxx  on cd8 compared with cd4 t cells may
translate into differential effects on trafficking of these
subsets, and on their respective roles in cns anti-viral
immune surveillance.22–24
also noteworthy is the observation that the standard
(300mg) intravenous infusion of natalizumab did not
fully block functional surface  xxxg1203xxx , because adding
more anti– xxxg1203xxx  in vitro to postinfusion pbmcs
could further diminish migration. although anti–
 xxxg1203xxx  has been reported to induce apoptosis in t
cells,25 we found that this occurred when cells were
concurrently activated, but not in unstimulated cells
such as those used in our migration assays (data not
shown). thus, the diminished migration we observed
after both in vivo and ex vivo addition of anti– xxxg1203xxx 
was unlikely to be confounded by apoptosis. we further observed that the effects of the standard dose on
both ␣4-integrin expression and cell migration were
not sustained over the monthly dose interval. these
findings suggest that with the standard regimen, natalizumab effect on trafficking may be neither complete,
nor persistent, features that actually may be desirable
because they would allow for intermittent immune surveillance. patients in whom functional  xxxg1203xxx  expression may fail to recover between infusions could be at
higher risk for complications.
a surprising finding that emerged from careful prospective monitoring of natalizumab-treated patients
was that the magnitude of the infusion effect could differ considerably across individuals, although was remarkably stable for the same patient across multiple
infusions. although our cohort is too small to meaningfully correlate biological, clinical, and neuroimaging
responses, these results suggest that patients may exhibit individualized response profiles to natalizumab.
we hope that the relatively simple immune readouts
described here will be applied to larger patient cohorts
as part of biomarker development and validation initiatives.
although discussion of the presumed mode of action
of anti– xxxg1203xxx  therapy has tended to focus on the
drug’s impact on cell trafficking,  xxxg1203xxx  is also recognized as playing a role in costimulation of t cells, and
anti– xxxg1203xxx  therapy in the experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis animal model of ms appears to impact t-cell activation.8,9,14 our results confirm reports that anti– xxxg1203xxx  and  xxxd2676xxx  signals can integrate to enhance human t cell activation.15,26 we
further demonstrate that in vivo natalizumab therapy
of ms patients can modulate the properties of patients’ serum as well as the activation threshold of
their circulating immune cells, including cnsautoreactive t cells.
the implication of such modulation remains to be
elucidated yet underscores the multiple biological ef-

fects that need to be considered in the context of anti–
 xxxg1203xxx  therapy. the future of natalizumab will be
predicated on our ability to eventually identify those
patients who will benefit most from therapy, and
those who may be at particular risk for severe complications such as pml. we describe several simple
immune response parameters that may be relevant to
both the efficacy and safety profiles of anti– xxxg1203xxx 
therapy and suggest that immune monitoring during
future exposure may be a valuable investment. ultimately, validation and careful correlation of reliable
biological measures, with rigorously obtained clinical
and neuroimaging data, will be critical to elucidation
of important responder/suboptimal responder issues,
toxicity profiles, and future phramacogenomic considerations.
