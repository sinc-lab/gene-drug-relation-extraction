summary-gaba~ and glycine receptors are close relatives in the ‘gene superfamily’ of ligand-gated ion
channels, but have distinctly different pharmacology.for example, barbiturates have two effects on gaba~
receptors (gaba~-r): at low micromolar concentrations (2–5 pm), the anesthetic barbiturate  xxxd2599xxx 
potentates submaximal chloride current responses to gaba; at higher concentrations (20-50 pm), the
barbiturate causes direct gating of the channel in the absence of agonist. neither of these barbiturate effects is
seen on the  xxxg904xxx  (gly-r). in order to study the structural parts of the gabaa-rinvolved in this
barbiturate pharmacology,two unique restrictionsites were introducedinto the cdnas encodingthe ~2 and fll
subunits of the human gabaa-rand the al subunit of the human gly-r. the first site (’x’) correspondedto
the c-terminal end of the third transmembrane domain (m3) in each subunit and enabled exchange of a cterminal fragment of -100 amino acids (which includes the large ‘cytoplasmic loop’ and m4 segment)
between gaba~-r and gly-r subunits. the second site (’s’) was =30 amino acids 3’-from the n-terminal
end of each subunit and enabled exchange of a small  xxxg2296xxx  between gabaa-rand gly-r
subunits.several chimeric receptor subunitcdnaswere constructedand the resulting receptors tested for their
ability to respondto gaba and glycine and for sensitivity to the barbiturate  xxxd2599xxx  (mtx). the results
show that neither the large c-terminal fragment nor the smaller  xxxg2296xxx  is associated with the
enhancementor direct activationof the gabaa-rby mtx.these results demonstratethe viability of chimeric
gabaa/gly-rand suggest that the method will be suitable for further investigation of the molecular basis of
the barbiturate pharmacologyof the gaba~-r. copyright 01996 elsevier science ltd.

in addition to the differences in agonist preference, the
receptors diverge in terms of allosteric modulation by
various classes of drugs and ions. the gabaa-rhas a
rich and complex pharmacology (see macdonald and
olsen, 1994; rabow et al., 1995, for review), including
positivemodulationby benzodiazepines(bzs)(chan and
farb, 1985; vicini et al., 1987), and several classes of
general anesthetics (harrison and simmonds, 1984;
harrison et al., 1987; nakahiro et al., 1989; hales and
lambert, 1991;wakamori et al., 1991;jones et al., 1992;
harrison et al., 1993;franks and lieb, 1994;harris et al.,
1995; lambert et al., 1995). barbiturates were the first
class of such agents shown to potentate the actions of
submaximal concentrations of gaba (ransom and
barker, 1976; barker and ransom, 1978; akaike et al.,
1985), increase the binding affinity of agonists at the
receptor

gaba-mediated ipsps (nicoll et al., 1975). at higher

both y- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) and glycine function

as inhibitory neurotransmitters within the mammalian
central nervous system. their major receptors, gabaa
receptors (gabaa-r)and glycinereceptors (gly-r), are
members of the ‘gene superfamily’ of ligand-gated ion
channels (betz, 1990), showing a similar selectivity for
anions, such as cl–, but differing in single-channel
mainstate conductance (bormann et al., 1987). each
receptor is believed to exist as a pentameric complex
(langosch et al., 1988; olsen and tobin, 1990). in each
case, multiple subunit isoforms and splice variants have
been identified by cdna cloning (olsen and tobin,
1990; vandenberg and schofield, 1994). although close
relatives in the sub-familyof ligand-gatedcl– channels,
these receptorshave a strikinglydifferentpharmacology.

concentrations,barbiturates also cause direct activation
of these cl– ion channels in the absence of an agonist
(mathers and barker, 1981; akaike et al., 1987). these
dual actionsof the barbiturateson the gaba~-roccur at
rather lower concentrations than their effects on other
systems (e.g. voltage-dependentca2+channels; ffrenchmullenet al., 1993)and are believed to be fundamentalto
their clinically useful central depressant properties
(reviewed in olsen, 1988). although the y subunit of
the ga13aa-rappears to be a requirement for modulation by bzs (pritchett et al., 1988a), barbiturate
modulation and direct gating are seen in receptors

consisting only of a- and /i’ subunits (levitan et al.,
1988; pritchett et al., 1988b). in contrast, the gly-r
shows no modulation by bz or barbiturates. in order to
investigatethe molecular basis for the modulation of the
gabaa-rby barbiturates,we have used the insensitivity
of the gly-r to examine the contribution to gabaa-r
pharmacologyof the various structuraldomains that may
make up these receptors (reviewed in smith and olsen,
1995). we have therefore studied the effects on
barbiturate pharmacology resulting from exchange of a
large c-terminal domain and a smaller n-terminal
domain between subunits of the gabaa-rand gly-r.

materialsand methods
site-directed mutagenesis

restriction sites were introduced into the cdnas
encoding the human ctl  xxxg904xxx  subunit and the
human u2and fll gaba~ receptor subunits[fig. l(top)],
in a homologous region (site x: an xba z site was
engineeredinto the amino acid sequencefsalleyaav
in glyr al) towards the end of the third transmembrane
domain, and in another region (site s: an xmai site was
engineered into the amino acid sequence darirpnfk
in glyr al) approximately25–30 amino acids from the nterminusof the mature polypeptide.the oligonucleotides
used were synthesizedby operon technologies(alameda, ca):

corresponding to bases 964-992 of the gly-r al
cdna sequence and introducingan xbai site;

oligonucleotideswere 5’-phosphorylatedusing polynucleotide kinase ( xxxg1720xxx ) and then used to create
mutations using the unique site elimination method
(deng and nickoloff, 1992;use kit; pharmaciabiotech,
piscataway,nj); a two primer method, in which a unique
sspz site in the expressionvector pcis2 is also mutated to
an alternate restriction site (ecorv or mluf). sspz
digestion is then used to select in favour of mutants,
and clones are screened by digestionwith either xbaz or
smai, as appropriate. all restriction enzymes and  xxxg1720xxx

dna ends, and incubating at 37°c for 60 min. the
reaction was then terminatedby heat inactivatingthe cip
at 75°c for 10 min in the presence of 5 mm edta, and
the dna was recovered by phenol:chloroformextraction
and ethanol precipitation. the dephosphorylated dna
fragments were then separated by electrophoresis on a
1% low melting point agarose (gibco brl, gaithersburg, md) gel, and eluted from the gel using a qiaquick
gel extraction kit (qiagen inc., chatsworth,ca). the
gel slice, containing each dna fragment, was excised,
solubilized by incubation at 50”c, and loaded to a spin
column. following a column wash, the dna was eluted
from the column using h20. the appropriate plasmid
fragmentswere then ligated (t4 dna ligase, neb, 14°c,
24 hr). ligation products were screened for orientation
by restrictiondigestsusing restrictionsitesunique to each
of the individualcdna inserts,and the sequencesof both
5’- and 3’-cdna termini, and the sequences through the
engineered restriction site were confirmed by doublestranded sequencing using the sanger dideoxy chain
termination method (sequenase 2.0, u.s. biochemical,
cleveland, oh), using the appropriate oligonucleotide
sequencing primers. the resulting chimeric cdnas
encoded the chimeric subunits, xl (glyr wl-gaba~r ~1), x2 (gabaa-rfll-glyr ~1) and x4 (gabaa-r
u2-glyr al), as illustrated in fig. 1 (center).
chimeras s1, s2, s3, s4. utilizing the xmai site,
introduced as described above, and an existing xmai
restrictionsite in the vector pcis2, dna fragments were
excised, ligated, screened and sequenced as described
above. the resulting chimeric cdnas encoded the
chimeric subunits, s1 (glyr lx1-gabaa-r~1), s2
(gaba~-r ~1-glyr al), s3 (glyr al-gabaa-r a2),
s4 (gabaa-r a2-glyr al), as illustrated in fig. 1
(bottom).
cell culture and transection

wild-typeor chimeric receptor cdnas were expressed
via the vector pcis2, which contains one copy of the
strong promoter from the cytomegalovirus and a polyadenylationsequence from sv40. these constructswere
used to transfect human embryonic kidney (hek) 293
cells as described previously (pritchett et al., 1988a).
hek 293 cells were obtained from atcc and maintained in culture on glass or plastic cover slips; cells were
passaged weekly by trypsin treatment for a maximum of
15 times before being discarded and replaced with early
passage cells. each cover slip of cells was transected
using the cap04 precipitation technique (okayama and
chen, 1987). 1–5 pg of each cdna was used per cover
slip; the cdna was in contact with the cells for 24 hr
under an atmosphere containing 3’%0c02, before being
removed and replaced with fresh culture medium in an
atmosphere of 5?t0c02.

chimeras xl, x2, x4. utilizing the xbaz site
introduced as described above, together with an existing
xbai restriction site in the vector pcis2, the plasmid
pcis2-glyr al was digested with xbai. following
restriction digestion and heat inactivation of the restriction enzyme at 65°c for 20 rein, the restrictionfragments
were dephosphorylated (sambrook et al., 1989) by electrophysiology

at identical flow rates via a multi-channelinfusion pump
(stoelting,wood dale, il, u.s.a.). the solutionchanger
was driven by protocols in the acquisition program
pclamp5 (axon instruments, foster city, ca). laminar flow was verified each day prior to beginning the
experiments by visual inspection using a low-power
objective to inspect the interfaces between the solution
streams, in which every second stream contained a blue
dye (blue food dye; fd and c blue no. 1 and fd and c
red no. 40, mccormick, baltimore, md) that was
removed prior to introducingthe cells and beginning the
experiment. responses were low-pass-filtered at 2 khz

we compared the wild-type receptors with receptors
composed of the various chimeric glycine/g~aa-r
subunits. these chimeras are divided into two groups:
first, those chimeras gated by gaba but not by glycine,
and secondly, those gated by glycine but not by gaba.
experimentswere first performed with chimeras s1 and
s3, in which a small n-terminaldomainof the gabaa-r
~1 or a2 subunit was replaced with the corresponding
portion of the gly-r ctl subunit. cells transected only
with the s1 or s3 cdna showed no significantgabagated currents, but co-transfection of s1 with wild-type
gabaa-r u2 subunit gave inward currents of
176 + 50 pa (n= 7), with an ec50 for gaba of
17.2 pm (h = 0.8) [fig.4(a)], while co-transfectionwith
s3 and the wild-type gabaa-r fll subunit gave
maximal currents of 131 t 18 pa (n = 5), with an ec50
for gaba of 22.5 pm (h = 1.5) [fig.4(a)]. experiments
were also performed with the chimeras x2 and x4:
chimeric gabaa/gly-rsubunits in which a c-terminal
domain of -100 amino acids in the gaba~-r fll or a2
subunit was replaced with the corresponding portion of

of chimeric receptors

we tested the sensitivityof the receptor formed by coexpression of gabaa-ra2+x2. the ec50 value for
gaba was 51.8pm in these receptors,and so sensitivity
to mtx was tested by application of an ec2[)
concentration of gaba (20 pm). these chimericreceptorsshowed
strong modulation by mtx. gaba (20 pm) produced
currentsthat were greatly enhancedby 50 pm mtx (fig.
6b). in addition, application of the barbiturate at high
concentrationscaused direct activationof the gaba~-r
(e.g. 500 ~m mtx; fig. 7). similarly, the receptors
formed by gabaa-r~l + x4, gaba~-rlx2+ s1 and
gabaa-rfll+ s3 showed near-normal enhancementof
submaximal gaba currents by mtx, both in terms of
the effective concentrations for enhancing agonist
responses and in terms of the magnitude of the
potentiating action (fig. 6). in addition, these receptors
could all be activated directly by mtx (fig. 7), with a
concentrationdependencefor mtx similar to that of the
wild-type gabaa-rr2fil.
conversely, the  xxxg904xxx  formed by chimera
xl was completely insensitiveto mtx. in this receptor,
the ec50value for glycinewas 364 pm. applicationof an

discussion

the data reported here, concerning single subunits of
the gaba~ receptor, are in broad agreement with
previous work in mammalian cells (verdoorn et al.,
1990; angelotti and macdonald, 1993), but are in
contrast with experiments in the xenopus oocyte
expression system, in which the fll subunit forms a
homomericreceptorwith a low affinityfor gaba (sanna
et al., 1995a).in a recent elegant study in both hek 293
cells and oocytes, fll expression was shown to be
associated with a zinc- and barbiturate-sensitive ion
channel (krishek et al., 1996).
the experiments described here show, for the first
time, that functional chimeric receptors can be formed
following exchange of structural domains between
gaba~-r and gly-r. the receptor formed from
chimera xl is expressed at a high level in hek 293
cells, with whole-cell current amplitudes comparable to
wild-type glyr ctl. this observation is consistent with
the finding that small ‘assembly boxes’ in the extracellular n-terminal domain of the gly-r mlsubunitplay
a dominant role in directing the assembly of functional
gly-r (kuhse et al., 1993). since these domains are
completely conserved in xl, the apparent efficiency of
assembly of xl is perhaps to be expected. likewise, the
regionsexchanged to create s2 and s4 are not thoughtto
be of any importance for gly-r assembly (kuhse et al.,
1993).the strikingdisparityin expressionlevelsbetween
these two chimeric receptorsmight imply that, in s2, the
strong assembly domains associated with gly-r al
(kuhse et al., 1993) become less effective due to a
change in local protein structure, since expression of s4
is comparable to that of wild-type glyral while s2 is
weakly expressed in comparison.
an ec50for glycine of approximately 350 pm was
observed in xl, about sevenfold higher than in the wildtype glyrul. this sevenfold decrease in the apparent
affinity for agonist is comparable to the differences in
ec50for glycineseen among receptorscomposedof glyr
al, u2and the low affinity glyra3 (grenningloh et al.,
1990). interestingly,the ec50 value for glycine acting on
the chimeric receptor s4 was approximately 17 pm,
about threefold lower than in the wild-type glyrul.
these differencesmay reflecttrue changesin equilibrium
bindingparametersas a resultof modestalterationsin the
conformation of the glycine binding pocket, but they
might also result from changes in the efficacy of the
agonistconsequentupon alterationsin ion channelgating
efficiency. single channel recordings and radioligand
binding experiments will be necessary to resolve these
issues.

1453

the situation,with respect to gaba~-r assembly, is
less clear than is the case for the  xxxg904xxx ,
although a consensus from mammalian cell studies
suggests that at least two (afl) or, preferably, three
(ufly) distinct subunits need to be present within the
pentameric complex in order to direct efficient assembly
of receptors operated by gaba (verdoorn et al., 1990;
angelotti and macdonald, 1993). like wild-type gaba~-r a2 and /31subunits in our laboratory and others
(verdoorn et al., 1990;angelotti and macdonald, 1993),
the chimeric subunitsx2, x4, s1 and s3 also fail to form
a functional homomeric gaba-gated receptor in hek
293 cells. this may indicate that these subunits fail to
self-assemble or, more likely, that they fail to form an
adequate gaba binding site in the absence of the
corresponding a2 or fll subunit. the results with the
receptorsformed by gaba~-ru2+x2and x4+gabaar~l reported here suggest that exchange of the large cterminal fragment of the fll subunit of the gabaa-r
fails to disrupt receptor assembly, indicating a dominant
role for n-terminal domains in gabaa-r assembly.
similarly,the small 30-amino-aciddomain at the extreme
n-terminusof the gaba~-r subunitswould seem not to
be essential for assembly of gaba~-r, in view of the
functional expression of both gaba~-rix2+sl and
s3+gaba~-rfll, a conclusion supported by the observation that epitope tagging of this region has no
deleterious effects on receptor assembly or function
(connolly et al., 1996).
the gaba-sensitive receptors formed by chimeric
subunits (e.g. the receptor formed by gaba~-rct2+x2)
exhibit a reasonablyhigh apparent affinityfor gaba, as
does the wild-type u2fll gaba~-r. a~ subunit combinations do form some functionalhigh affinitygabaa-r
(levitan et al., 1988; sanna et al., 1995b), although,
relative to c@ygabaa-r,the upreceptors have a lower
single-channel conductance (verdoorn et al., 1990;
angelottiand macdonald, 1993)and a greater sensitivity
to inhibition by zn2+(draguhn et al., 1990), and lack
modulation by benzodiazepines (levitan et al., 1988;
pritchett et al., 1988a). however, up gaba~-r retain
normal pharmacological modulation by barbiturates
(levitan et al., 1988; pritchett et al., 1988a), propofol
(jones et al., 1995; sanna et al., 1995b) and volatile
anesthetics(harrison et al., 1993; harris et al., 1995).
effects of barbiturates on chimeric receptors

all of the chimeric receptors studied here, which are
gated by glycine, are clearly insensitive to barbiturates,
while the gaba-gatedchimeras showed normal or nearnormal barbiturate sensitivity.at first glance, this might
suggestthat identicaldomainsare involvedin the binding
of both gaba and barbiturates. in fact, this is unlikely
for two reasons: firstly, binding data show that barbiturates allosterically enhance agonist binding, rather than
displacingagonist from the gaba binding site/s (asano
and ogasawara, 1981; olsen and snowman, 1982);
secondly, in an extensive series of mutagenesis studies

1454

v. v. koltchine et al.

in al~2y2 gabaa-r,it has been shown that a numberof
point mutations in the f12 subunit, which drastically
reduced the apparent affinity of gaba (estimated from
the ec50 in the xerzoptsoocyte expression system), had
little, or no, effect on the direct gating of the channelsby
barbiturates (amin and weiss, 1993). these mutations
were in the latter half of the n-terminal extracellular
domain, after the single cysteine loop; mutation of many
of the analogous residues in the al subunit was
completely ineffective. there are reports showing
barbiturate effects on homomeric p subunit receptors
(sanna et al., 1995a), which suggest that the p subunit
alone is sufficientto form a barbiturate binding site, but
this does not at present rule out a role for u subunitsin the
action of the barbiturate on the native gabaa-r.in this
context, it is worth noting that a wide disparity in
barbiturate efficacies is observed between receptors
comprised of alf12y2 and ci6/12y2subunits (thompson
et al., 1996), indicating that the  xxxg220xxx  is, indeed,
likely to make a contributionto the barbiturate pharmacology of the gabaa-r.
conclusion

in conclusion, it seems unequivocallyclear, from the
data reported here, that neither the extreme n-terminus,
nor the large cytoplasmicloop,the tm4 domainor the cterminus of either cy2or ~1 subunit contributes significantly to the action of the barbiturate mtx on the
gaba~-r. however, the demonstrated viability of the
chimeric gaba/glycinereceptors studied here suggests
that further application of this technique will ultimately
be successful in providing a molecular explanation for
barbiturate modificationof inhibitory synaptic transmission, first observed over 50 yr ago (eccles and malcolm,
1946; eccles et al., 1963) and described prior to the
elucidation of the neurotransmitterrole of gaba.
