low-molecular-weight heparins:

an overview of their pharmacodynamics,
pharmacokinetics and metabolism in
humans

abstract

low-molecular-weight heparins (lmwhs) comprise a group in the class of
antithrombotic medications, a class headed by unfractionated heparin
(ufh). the lmwhs, with mean molecular weights of 4.0-6.0 kd, differ
in their individual manufacturing processes, the distribution of their frag-
ment molecular weights, their in vitro potency (anti-xa, antithrombin and
anticoagulant activities) and, consequently, in their biodynamic patterns,
recommended dose regimen, and efficacy/safety ratio. their drug dispos:
tion profiles have been evaluated using two significant markers of their
pharmacodynamic activity, namely anti-xa and anti-ila activities. since
they are mainly administered subcutaneously, then compared to ufh,
they are almost completely absorbed (f = 90%) and, in contrast to ufh,
those for which data are available in the literature exhibit linear pharma-
cokinetics with proportionality between anti-xa (and anti-ila in some
cases) plasma concentration and dose, and stationary distribution volume
and clearance processes when the dosage is increased. their distribution
volume is close to the blood volume, they are partially metabolized by
desulphatation and depolymerization, but urinary excretion of anti-xa
activity for enoxaparin,  xxxd1805xxx  and  xxxd2690xxx , all given at doses for
prevention of venous thrombosis, is between 5 and 10% of the injected
dose. however, these lmwhs differ in the extent of their non-renal clear-
ance, resulting in different apparent elimination half-life values and rela-
tive apparent bioavailability. when considering certain at-risk situations,
using doses for preventing thromboembolism, the lmwhs do not signifi-
cantly cross the placenta of pregnant women and their excretion profiles
are only slightly altered in severe (endogenous creatinine clearance less
than 15 ml/min) renal disease patients when given at doses recommended
for prevention of venous thromboembolism. because of the differences
among lmwhs, the clinical profile of a given lmwh cannot be extrapo-
lated to another one or generalized to the whole lmwh family.

the prevention and treatment of thromboem-
bolism but is still a mysterious compound, a
‘challenging enigma’ with poorly understood
properties [9, 10].

the low-molecular-weight heparins
(lmwhs) were actively developed following
the preliminary observations of johnson et al.
[11] and andersson et al. [12] who discovered,
between 1975 and 1980, that lmwh frac-
tions, prepared from commercial ufh, pro-
gressively lose their potency to prolong acti-
vated plasma thromboplastin time (aptt)
while retaining their ability to inhibit acti-
vated  xxxg741xxx  ( xxxg741xxx ), and that lmwhs
induce less bleeding in experimental models
than ufh. although lmwhs may have
roughly similar mean molecular weights
(commonly in the range 3,500-6,500 d), they
differ for many characteristics [13], including
manufacturing process, their composition
in glycosaminoglycan (gag) fragments,
molecular-weight-range distribution, electric
charges (like ufh, they are polysulphated
uronic acid-amino sugar derivatives and, as
such, polyanionic electrolytes), and in vitro
anti-xa and antithrombin potencies. conse-
quently, they are different pharmaceutical en-
tities, each characterized by its own pharma-
cokinetic profile and safety/efficacy ratio [14—
17]. the aim of this paper is to summarize
and review the available data in the literature
on the disposition pattern in humans of the
most frequently investigated lmwhs.

methodology: how to study the
disposition profile of lmwhs

like ufh, the individual components of
lmwhs are similar to endogenous com-
pounds found in several mammalian tissues.
indeed, the mucopolysaccharides (as short
and long gags) contain uronic acid and gly-
cosamine moieties which are difficult to dif-

biodynamics of lmwhs in humans

ferentiate from endogenous ones. however,
jaques et al. [18] have shown that it is possible
to measure absolute amounts of heparin and
gags in plasma by quantitative gel microel-
ectrophoresis. nevertheless, the most fre-
quently used tools for defining the pharmaco-
kinetics of lmwhs (and ufh) are those
which are linked to the pharmacodynamic/
biological activities of lmwhs on the coagu-
lation cascade, namely, prolongation of clot-
ting times (such as aptt and heptest®) or
specific determination of  xxxg741xxx  and factor
ila activities [19, 20]. thus, even if these
pharmacodynamic markers do not describe
all the active gags (simple chains con-
structed of repeating disaccharide units)
and the overall antithrombotic activity of
lmwhs, they reflect the fate of lmwhs in
blood (and other body fluids) and are easy to
calculate and compare, from a drug disposi-
tion point of view.

disposition profile of lmwhs in
humans

drawing on the available published infor-
mation, it will be possible to summarize here
the absorption and excretion patterns of
lmwhs in humans. however, it is not yet
possible to have a clear view of the distribu-
tion and biotransformation profiles of
lmwhs without reference to experimental
studies in animals.

at the moment, data on the pharmacoki-
netic/biotransformation profiles of lmwhs
are mainly available in the literature for dalte-
parin sodium ( xxxd1805xxx ®), enoxaparin sodium
(lovenox®,  xxxd1997xxx ®),  xxxd2690xxx  calcium
(fraxiparin sodium®), reviparin sodium (cli-
varin®), sandoparin (mono- xxxd2482xxx ®), tinza-
parin sodium ( xxxd3379xxx ®,  xxxd3379xxx ®) and ar-
deparin sodium ( xxxd214xxx ®). the most fre-
quently computed parameters, when these

lmwhs are injected subcutaneously (s.c.),
are summarized in table 1 (some data are still
missing).

absorption

since ufh is the necessary reference
(characterized by non-linear pharmacokinet-
ics), the absorption pattern of lmwhs
should be individually described in terms of
the rate and extent of s.c. absorption, absolute
bioavailability [s.c. versus intravenous (i.v.)
dosing] and the dose-proportionality relation-
ship.

rate of absorption following s.c.

administration

for most of the already marketed and ther-
apeutically used lmwh, the rate of absorp-
tion of active gags was determined using the
rate of appearance of anti-xa and anti-ila
activities in plasma. overall, in terms of anti-
xa activity, the mean tmax of the appearance
of amax anti-xa activity is in the 3- to 4-hour
range [21-25], except for reviparin, for which
it is shorter, 2.0-3.0 h [26]. the rate of ap-
pearance of plasma antithrombin activity
could be a little slower, but this is not yet
clearly established [24, 25, 27].

absolute bioavailability

all lmwhs are readily absorbed from the
s.c. tissue site of injection and compared to
ufh (f = 10-29% at low doses [28]), their
bioavailability is thus increased. on the basis
of the measurement of plasma anti-xa activi-
ty, their absolute bioavailability (at the rec-
ommended doses for prevention of venous
thromboembolism) is close to or higher than
90%, at least for those of which data are alrea-
dy published [14].

dose-proportionality relationship

the pharmacokinetics of ufh are not
linear, meaning that total body clearance, cl/
f, and excretion rate decrease (the apparent
elimination half-life ty, is thus prolonged)
when the injected dose increases. in contrast,
the pharmacokinetics of most lmwhs are
linear (at least in the range of doses including
those for prevention of venous thromboem-
bolic diseases) for anti-xa activity [21, 22, 24,
26], but it is not yet clear that this is also true
for antithrombin activity. to my knowledge,
for both biological activities, linear pharma-
cokinetics including the dose-related increase
of amax and area under the curve (auc) and
stationary values for distribution volume v4/
f, mean residence time mrt, total body
clearance cl/f and apparent elimination
half-life ty,, are only established and published
for enoxaparin [24, 27].

distribution

the components of the gags belonging to
the lmwhs are mostly natural and endoge-
nous saccharides. consequently, it is difficult
to separate those which are introduced in-
to the body following administration of
lmwhs from those which are structural
components of various tissues. nevertheless,
it is possible to do this using radiolabelled
material, either with internally incorporated
radioactive isotopes such as tritium (3h) or
sulphur (35s) (both in animals), or with exter-
nally linked short-lived y-emitting isotopes
such as technetium (°°™tc; in humans). la-
belling with 35s has been employed to study
the plasma kinetics of a low dose of a lmwh
fraction administered to healthy volunteers
[29].

in rats given 100 u/kg of 3h- xxxd1805xxx  as
a single or repeated i.v. dose, nishiyama et al.
[30] found that the total radioactivity (parent

28 haemostasis 1996;26(suppl 2):24-38

gags + their metabolites) is rapidly distrib-
uted to most of the organs and tissues but with
highest concentrations in the kidney, adrenal
gland, liver and intestinal tract. a similar
experiment using 35s-labelled enoxaparin
[frydman et al., unpubl. data] led to compara-
ble results.

in humans, laforest et al. [31] have shown
that for ufh and enoxaparin, both labelled
with "tc, most of the radioactivity in
healthy volunteers was first localized within
the heart and thereafter (by 6 h post-injection)
distributed preferentially within the heart, liv-
er and kidneys. interestingly, they also found
that, in plasma, the radioactivity persisted
much longer than biological activities for both
products. using the same radioisotope, psuja
[32] has compared in 10 patients with uncom-
plicated myocardial infarction, the plasma ki-
netics of ufh to those of the lmwhs
cy 216 and cy 222. similar values for phar-
macokinetic parameters (auc, distribution
and elimination half-lives) were computed for
these three compounds, those of cy 216 cor-
responding closely to the values found in
healthy volunteers [33].

in humans, the apparent distribution vol-
ume v,/f of lmwh anti-xa activity is close
to the plasma or the blood volume. for tinza-
parin [34] (dose: 5,000 iu anti-xa, s.c.), the
distribution volume of anti-xa activity was
3.9 litres while it was 10.1 litres for antithrom-
bin activity. in a cross-over comparative
study [35, 36], it was recently shown that
there is no statistically significant difference
between the anti-xa activity distribution
volumes for enoxaparin (dose: 2,000 and
4,000iu anti-xa, s.c.),  xxxd2690xxx  (dose:
3,075 iu anti-xa, s.c.) and  xxxd1805xxx  (dose:
2,500 iu anti-xa, s.c.) with vz/f values of 5.5
+ 1.2and5.2 + 1.2,6.8 + 1.9 and 7.7 + 2.5
litres, respectively. however,  xxxd1805xxx  ex-
hibits a shorter (p < 0.05) mean residence
time [5.3 + 1.1 compared to 6.7 + 0.9

frydman
(2,000 iu enoxaparin), 7.4 + 0.7 (4,000 iu
enoxaparin) and 7.1 + 1.0h ( xxxd2690xxx )].
this means that both enoxaparin and nadro-
parin anti-xa activities remain longer in the
blood than that of  xxxd1805xxx .

regarding the distribution of active gags
into tissues, it is important to note there is
strong experimental evidence indicating the
high affinity of ufh for the vascular endothe-
lium [37, 38]. therefore, it seems likely that
the ability of ufh or its fractions to bind to
vascular endothelium [39] might account for
their tissue distribution pattern and biotrans-
formation profile. overall, this might partly
explain the variations in the distribution vol-
umes and mean residence time of the differ-
ent lmwhs already cited.

biotransformation and metabolism

like ufh, the lmwhs are complex
gags combining sulphated saccharides of
various lengths. as a consequence, their me-
tabolism pattern involves depolymerisation
and desulphatation. thus, they are partially
degraded in the liver and partially eliminated
by the kidneys in forms retaining biological
activity [14]. it has been recently shown [36]
that around 10% of gags with anti-xa activ-
ity are recovered in the urine of healthy volun-
teers given s.c. single prophylactic doses of
 xxxd1805xxx , enoxaparin and  xxxd2690xxx .

animal studies have allowed in-depth
evaluation of the metabolic pattern of
lmwhs. for  xxxd1805xxx  [30] and enoxaparin
[frydman et al., unpubl. data], it was shown
that several tissues (liver, kidney, bile) con-
tain gags of various lengths, more or less
desulphated (as a function of time), some of
them still exhibiting full properties of the par-
ent compound in the interaction with anti-
thrombin iii and/or protamine.

biodynamics of lmwhs in humans

according to dawes and pepper [40], a
part of the ufh dose injected into humans is
desulphated, then released into the blood, de-
polymerized in the kidneys and finally ex-
creted in the urine by s5s-9h post-injection.
presumably, this biotransformation pathway
might also be valid for lmwhs.

balance of excretion

in animals (rat, rabbit or dog) and in hu-
mans, ufh and lmwhs are excreted (in
terms of total radioactivity) from the body
mainly through the kidneys, but also through
the bile. ufh is eliminated via both a rapid/
dose-dependent saturable mechanism and a
slower first-order clearance mechanism [15,
41]. in contrast, it is thought [42] that
lmwhs do not bind significantly to endothe-
lial cells and are therefore eliminated by a
non-saturable renal mechanism. it was dem-
onstrated [36] that for two enoxaparin doses
(2,000 and 4,000 iu anti-xa), the extent of
urinary excretion of biologically active gags
(here those exhibiting anti-xa activity) is li-
near in healthy voluneers.

according to nishiyama et al. [30], in the
rat given a single 100 iu/kg i.v. dose of 3h-
 xxxd1805xxx , urinary excretion of total radioac-
tivity accounts for 80% of the dose while
faeces contain only 0.6% and the carcass
about 11%. repeated dosing slightly increases
the faecal elimination of tritiated compounds
(by 3.5%) but in rabbits also given a single
100 iu/kg dose, urinary and fecal excretion
were 72 and 2%, respectively. in rats [unpubl.
data] given single i.v. or s.c. doses (0.85 mg/
kg) or repeat i-v. injection (0.85 mg/kg/day for
7 days) of enoxaparin, the balance of excre-
tion and tissue retention patterns are (urine/
faeces/carcass) 64/11/10, 69/8/12 and 73/8/
8%, respectively. in dogs given  xxxd3379xxx , the
major route of elimination was renal filtration

(80 to 90% of the dose was recovered in the
urine) with only 1-2% in the faeces [43]. in
contrast, in healthy subjects given ufh or
enoxaparin [31], both labelled with 9°™tc, the
urinary excretion of radioactive material was
very rapid (fig. 1), accounting for 46% (ufh)
and 41% (enoxaparin) of the dose within 24 h.
this indicated that, not taking into account
(a) the eventual remaining urinary excretion
after the first 24 h and (b) the eventual reten-
tion of 9™tc radioactivity in tissues such as
bone, biliary excretion would represent, maxi-
mally, about 54 and 59% of the dose of ufh
and enoxaparin, respectively. psuja [32] has
also shown, in patients with uncomplicated
myocardial infarction, that the urinary excre-
tion of total radioactivity in the 5-hour period
following i.v. injection of 9°"tc-ufh ac-
counted for only 35% (mean) of the dose
while those of cy 216 and cy 222, both also
labelled with technetium, were 41 and 43%
(mean values), respectively, of the total ra-
dioactivity injected iv. thus, the kidney
route is, within the limits of this labelling
method, involved in clearing only 30-50% of
the radioactivity from plasma throughout the
6-hour observation period. therefore, it was
presumed [32] that around 50% of the 9™tc-
ufh, °™tc-cy 216 and 9™tc-cy 222 in-
jected doses reached and accumulated in the
tissue compartments or were eliminated by a
route other than into the urine.

frydman
in the study already cited above [36], it was
demonstrated that the renal excretion of
gags with anti-xa activity is significantly
(p > 0.05) higher following enoxaparin s.c.
injection (a, = 6.4 and 8.7% of the 2,000 and
4,000 iu anti-xa doses, respectively; n = 20)
than after  xxxd1805xxx  (a, = 3.4%; n = 20) or
 xxxd2690xxx  (a, = 3.9%; n = 20), indicating
that enoxaparin is less extensively biode-
graded into inactive gag fragments than the
other lmwhs. this is confirmed by the fact
that these three lmwhs exhibit different val-
ues (fig.2) for total body clearance cl/f
(arithmetic means: 17 and 14 ml/min for
enoxaparin; 33.0 ml/min for  xxxd1805xxx  and
22 ml/min for  xxxd2690xxx ) but have similar
anti-xa activity renal clearances (clp: enoxa-
parin = 1.0-1.2 ml/min;  xxxd1805xxx  = 1.0 ml/
min and  xxxd2690xxx  = 0.8 ml/min. thus,
these three lmwhs exhibit different mean
values for their non-renal clearance (clyr =
cl-clp): 16-13 ml/min for enoxaparin;
22 ml/min for  xxxd1805xxx  and 20 ml/min for
 xxxd2690xxx . in addition, the interindividual
variability of the kinetic parameters of distri-
bution (amax) and elimination (clearance and
half-life) of enoxaparin is less than that pre-
viously reported for  xxxd2690xxx  by rostin et
al. [44].

furthermore, this difference in biotrans-
formation leads to a difference in the appar-
ent absolute bioavailability. indeed, normal-
ized to the same injected dose (1,000 1u
anti-xa), in plasma enoxaparin generates an
overall anti-xa activity (fig. 2b, c) 1.48 fold
greater (p < 0.001) than that of  xxxd2690xxx 
and 2.28-fold greater (p < 0.001) than that of
 xxxd1805xxx  whereas that induced by nadropar-
in is 1.54-fold greater (p < 0.001) than that of
 xxxd1805xxx .

the values of total body clearance of dalte-
parin found in our study [35, 36] are compa-
rable to those computed by lockner et al. [45]
and simonneau et al. [46].

the pharmacokinetic profile of plasma
anti-xa and antithrombin activities at steady
state following repeated dosing with lmwhs
is little documented in the literature.

patients with pulmonary embolism given
s.c.  xxxd2690xxx  calcium 400 or 500 icu/kg/
day (in 2 or 3 injection each day) exhibited a
dose-proportional increase in anti-xa activity
and also a significant increase in anti-xa ac-
tivity between days 2 and 7 of treatment [47].
this would indicate that, at this dose level, a
steady state is not achieved before day 7 of
repeat dosing. in addition, in a clinical trial
involving 150 patients receiving a daily dose
of 7,500icu of  xxxd2690xxx  calcium (s.c.)
[48], significant antithrombin plasma levels
were detected only after 3 and 7 days of treat-
ment. in another study [49], repeated dosing
with  xxxd2690xxx  calcium (7,500 icu/day for
5 days, s.c.) did not induce a significant
increase in the amax of anti-xa activity but
generated a significant rise in terms of global
plasma levels (i.e. auc). as expected, a twice
daily s.c. injection of the same lmwh
(7,500 icu every 12h) resulted in the accu-
mulation of anti-xa activity, as detected by
the mean trough level, amin [21, 50, 51]. in
healthy volunteers [52] and patients [53, 54]
receiving  xxxd3379xxx  2,500-7,500 iu anti-xa
or 35-1501u anti-xa/kg/day for 5-7 days,
plasma anti-xa activity increased progres-
sively [34, 52-54], with slight anti-xa activity
remaining 24h after each dose in patients
with established deep venous thrombosis [54]
while not being detectable in healthy volun-
teers [52, 53].

recently, a parallel-group (n = 12 + 12
healthy male volunteers) study compared the
disposition profiles of enoxaparin (dose regi-
men: 30 mg or 3,000 iu anti-xa twice daily
s.c.) and ufh (dose regimen: 5,000 u three
times a day s.c.), both given for 7 days (with

blood samples taken for kinetics following one
of the s.c. injections on days | and 9). the
main features of this study [55] were as fol-
lows. for enoxaparin, the anti-xa amax (at
tmax = 2.25h) increased by 34% and the
aucp-12h by 55% with a prolongation (p <
0.001) of the mean retention time from 5.9 h
(at day 1; n = 12) to 9.5 h (at day 9; n = 12).
this is due to a decrease (p < 0.001) in the
total body clearance of anti-xa activity
(fig. 3a), over the same period, from 19 + 3 to
12 + 2ml/min, with a deceleration of the
elimination rate (ty, = 3.4 h at day | and 5.9h
at day 9), without any change in the distribu-

32 haemostasis 1996;26(suppl 2):24-38

tion volume (v,/f). the non-significant (p >
0.05) change (fig. 3b) in the total body clear-
ance of antithrombin activity (from 72 + 27
to 66 + 23 ml/min) was not associated with
a significant (p > 0.05) increase in anti-
thrombin activity (only +8% for auco_12n).
for ufh, the anti-xa amax increased by
54% but starting from a lower level, with a
comparable rise in the aucp-12» due to a
decrease in the total body clearance from 96
+ 30 to 69 + 30 ml/min. concomitantly,
there were 64 and 77% increases in ajax and
aucp-12h in antithrombin (anti-iia) activity
due to the decrease in its clearance (cl/f)
from 196 + 97 to 130 + 83 ml/min during
repeated dosing. thus, at the steady state,
the total body clearance of anti-xa activity
of enoxaparin was 8-fold lower than that of
ufh while the clearance of its antithrombin
activity was 2-fold lower than that of ufh.
this results, at steady state, in a greater ex-
posure to anti-xa activity with enoxaparin
than with ufh, and in a weaker exposure to
antithrombin activity with enoxaparin than
with ufh. whether or not this specific pat-
tern is responsible for the better safety/effica-
cy profile of enoxaparin remains unclear and
needs further study.

at-risk situations

ufh and lmwhs may have to be admin-
istered to patients in risk situations when it is
necessary to prevent or to treat thromboem-
bolic events. such situations include the inter-
action of age and venous-thromboembolism
risk, pregnancy and lactation, and renal insuf-
ficiency. in addition, the use of these medica-
tions in liver insufficiency patients is always
debatable.

frydman
elderly surgical patients (interaction of

age and risk for deep-vein thrombosis)

to my knowledge, there are no published
data on the influence of the interaction of age
and venous-thromboembolism risk on the
disposition profile of lmwhs. in an unpub-
lished paper [collignon et al.], the pharmaco-
kinetics of enoxaparin were compared be-
tween 12 elderly candidates (6 males, 6 fe-
males) for total hip replacement (mean age: 70
+ 6 years; body weight: 77 + 12 kg) and 12
healthy young volunteers (age: 23 + 2 years;
body weight: 72 + 8 kg), both groups being
given the lmwh in the 30 mg twice daily
dose regimen. there was no significant differ-
ence (p > 0.05), between the two groups for
kinetic parameters of aptt and the heptest
estimated from clotting-time data, or for ami-
dolytic anti-xa activity data.

pregnancy and lactation

preclinical studies performed with 3h-dal-
teparin [30] or 35s-enoxaparin in pregnant
rats [frydman et al., unpubl. data] have
shown that the transfer of labelled gags
through the placenta and into fetal tissues is
extremely weak. similarly, the passage of such
radioactive material into breast milk of lactat-
ing rats is very low. recently, fejgin and
lourwood [56] reviewed the published expe-
rience with the utilization of lmwhs in ob-
stetrics and gynaecology and emphasized that
various lmwhs (enoxaparin,  xxxd2690xxx ,
 xxxd1805xxx ,  xxxd3379xxx , sandoparin) do not
cross, or at least cross only to a very limited
extent, the placenta in any pregnancy trimes-
ter. so, combined with the, albeit limited,
clinical experience, this pattern suggests that
these lmwhs are safe and effective for
thromboprophylaxis in at-risk pregnant wom-
en [57]. unfortunately, the measurement of
biologically active gags in female breast
milk is very complex and their failure to pass
into suckling babies has not yet been proved.

biodynamics of lmwhs in humans

consequently, it is logical to recommend, at
the moment, not to use lmwhs in lactating
women.

liver disease

coagulation factor biosynthesis is often de-
pressed in liver failure situations, and so the
therapeutic use of ufh [58] and lmwhs in
patients with liver insufficiency has been lim-
ited, also because these antithrombotic drugs
are known to be actively metabolized through
the liver. this might explain the paucity of
published data in this domain.

renal insufficiency

it is known that elimination of ufh anti-
coagulant activity can be prolonged [58] in
patients with chronic renal failure given large
doses of ufh, while low doses do not seem to
interfere notably with its overall body clear-
ance [59].

in view of the published animal data [30]
and those from human studies [36], which
indicate that the main route of clearance of
gags occurs via the kidney, it is often ex-
pected that lmwh excretion will be im-
paired in patients with renal insufficiency.

data are currently available for three
lmwhs:  xxxd2690xxx  calcium,  xxxd214xxx  so-
dium and enoxaparin sodium. for nadropar-
in (dose: a single 100 icu/kg i.v. injection)
[60], it was shown that in patients with creati-
nine clearance lower than 50 ml/min, the
elimination half-life of plasma anti-xa activi-
ty was 1.6-fold than of healthy subjects, but
with no correlation between creatinine clear-
ance and lmwh anti-xa activity clearance.
however, the authors recommended moni-
toring plasma anti-xa activity in renal disease
patients given this lmwh, in order to detect
a need to reduce the dose. for  xxxd214xxx  sodi-
um [61] (rd heparin,  xxxd214xxx ) given as a
single iv. 100 iu anti-xa/kg dose,  xxxd214xxx

activities, was reduced and the apparent elim-
ination half-life prolonged in patients with
mild, moderate and end-stage renal impair-
ment. the clearances of plasma anti-xa and
antithrombin activities were reduced by more
than 33 and 25%, respectively [62]. however,
no specific recommendation is proposed by
the authors for management of the dose regi-
men of  xxxd214xxx  in this patient population.
in 1986, follea et al. [63] compared the kinet-
ic patterns of enoxaparin and ufh, both giv-
en i.v. in patients with chronic renal failure.
ufh showed a rapid initial disappearance
followed by a slower convex elimination
curve. for enoxaparin, linear or concave
elimination curves were seen with a longer
anti-xa elimination half-life. there was no
control group in this study, but elimination
rates were similar to those computed in
healthy subjects by aiach et al. [64], leading
the authors to the conclusion that the renal
route plays a minimal role in enoxaparin ex-
cretion. another study, conducted by cadroy

34 haemostasis 1996;26(suppl 2):24~38

et al. [65], in 12 chronic renal insufficiency
patients (mean creatinine clearance: 11.4 ml/
min) concluded that elimination of the anti-
xa activity of enoxaparin was delayed, com-
pared to healthy subjects (mean creatinine
clearance: 105 ml/min). in fact, this could
simply be due to the fact that the apparent
elimination half-life of anti-xa activity com-
puted in the control group (ty, = 2.94 +
0.19 h) was shorter than that cited in many
other published studies [14], while the appar-
ent half-life of anti-xa activity in renal dis-
ease patients (5.12 + 2.01 h) was roughly sim-
ilar to that computed in various healthy sub-
jects and patients (i.e. with normal kidney
function) [14, 66, 67]. this feature is con-
firmed by a more extensive study [collignon
et al., unpubl. data] involving 41 healthy vol-
unteers and renal impairment patients
(fig. 4, 5). in this trial, following a single s.c.
injection of 4,000 iu anti-xa enoxaparin, the
only statistically significant changes, com-
pared to the control group, were prolonga-

frydman
tions of mean residence time (11.3 + 1.7 vs.
8.5 + 1.7 h, p< 0.02) and apparent elimina-
tion half-life (fig. sc) of plasma anti-xa activi-
ty (t, = 6.9 + 1.2 vs. 5.2 + 1.6h, p< 0.01),
due to a non-significant (p > 0.05) 30% de-
crease (fig. 5d) in its total body clearance in
severely ill patients (with creatinine and inu-
lin clearances below 15 ml/min). thus, for
enoxaparin, no dose adjustment is required
for patients at risk of thrombosis who exhibit
impaired renal function, at least from a biody-
namic point of view.

conclusion

the pharmacokinetic
lmwhs provide the potential to inject these
drugs, either twice or once daily, by the s.c.
route, in fixed doses without laboratory moni-
toring and thus, to improve the safety/effica-
cy/cost balance for preventing venous throm-
boembolic events. in addition, accumulating
clinical evidence emphasizes that certain
lmwhs administered s.c. may replace con-
ventional continuous i.v. ufh therapy or the
three times a day s.c. regimen. however, the
lmwhs differ from each other in manufac-
turing, physicochemical and biological (in vi-
tro and in vivo) properties and in their phar-
macokinetic and biotransformation patterns.
therefore, the clinical findings associated
with a given lmwhs preparation cannot be
extrapolated to another one or generalized to
the whole lmwhs family [68, 69]. this state-
ment is very important, because the incidence
