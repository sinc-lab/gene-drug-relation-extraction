 xxxd1832xxx , a genetically engineered fusion protein combining the enzymatically active domains of diphtheria
toxin and the full-length sequence for
interleukin-2 (il-2), efficiently targets lymphoma cells expressing the high-affinity
 xxxg1175xxx  ( xxxg1175xxx ) consisting of the
␣/ xxxd924xxx /cd25, ␤/p75/ xxxg1175xxx , and ␥/ xxxg1176xxx /
 xxxg1176xxx  chains. in vitro studies demonstrated that the retinoid x receptor (rxr)
retinoid,  xxxd330xxx , at biologically relevant concentrations of 10ⴚ6m to 10ⴚ8m,
upregulated both the  xxxd924xxx  and p75 sub-

units of the  xxxg1175xxx  and enhanced 5- to
10-fold the susceptibility of t-cell leukemia cells to  xxxd1832xxx . to determine whether this biomodulatory effect
could be recapitulated in vivo, we treated
14 patients with relapsed or refractory
cutaneous t-cell lymphoma with escalating doses of  xxxd330xxx  (75 mg/day-300
mg/day) and  xxxd1832xxx  (18 mcg/kg
per day ⴛ 3 days every 21 days) in a
phase 1 trial. overall response was 67%
(4 complete responses, 4 partial responses). modulation of  xxxg1175xxx  expres-

sion was observed at or above a  xxxd330xxx  dose of 150 mg/day. four patients
experienced grade 2 or 3 leukopenia, and
2 had grade 4 lymphopenia. our results
demonstrate that the combination of  xxxd1832xxx  and  xxxd330xxx  is well
tolerated and that even low doses (150
mg/day) of  xxxd330xxx  are capable of in
vivo upregulation of cd25 expression on
circulating leukemia cells. (blood. 2005;

introduction
 xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ; ligand pharmaceuticals, san diego,
ca) is a fusion protein that consists of the full-length sequence of
the interleukin-2 (il-2) protein genetically fused to the enzymatically active and translocating domains of diphtheria toxin. the il-2
moiety of the molecule binds to the interleukin-2 receptor ( xxxg1175xxx )
and is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis in an acidified vesicle. upon acidification, the enzymatically active moiety of
diphtheria toxin passes into the cytosol where, over several hours, it
inhibits protein synthesis via  xxxd80xxx  (adp)–
ribosylation of elongation factor-2, ultimately resulting in cell
death.1-4 binding affinity of  xxxd1832xxx  is highest for the
heterotrimeric form of the  xxxg1175xxx  ( xxxg1174xxx  ␣, ␤, and ␥), but the fusion
protein is capable of binding with lower affinity and intoxicating
leukemia cells expressing the intermediate-affinity receptor ( xxxg1175xxx 
␤ and ␥).5 expression of  xxxg1175xxx  subunits by leukemia cells is tightly
regulated by a number of cellular factors, including cytokine
stimulation and expression of activation-associated genes.  xxxd1832xxx  is effective in the treatment of cutaneous t-cell
lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ) and other types of lymphoid malignancies.6-9
 xxxd330xxx  ( xxxd330xxx ; ligand pharmaceuticals) is a retinoid x
receptor (rxr) selective retinoid that has demonstrated clinical
efficacy in patients with early- and advanced-stage  xxxg2343xxx .10,11 in
previous studies, we demonstrated that the retinoid acid receptor
(rar) retinoid, all-trans  xxxd3417xxx , and the rxr retinoid,
 xxxd330xxx , at biologically relevant concentrations of 10⫺6m to
10⫺8m, upregulated both the  xxxd924xxx  and p75 subunits of the  xxxg1175xxx  in
vitro and enhanced the susceptibility of leukemia cells 5- to 10-fold
to  xxxd1832xxx .12 the ability of the rxr modulators to form

heterodimers with various receptor partners that are important in
cellular function and physiology indicates that the biologic activities of  xxxd330xxx  are more diverse than those of compounds that
activate the rars. once activated, these rxr receptors function as
transcription factors that regulate various cellular processes. to further
explore the effects of  xxxd330xxx  on  xxxg1175xxx  expression and potentially
enhance the susceptibility of leukemia cells to  xxxd1832xxx ,
we conducted a phase 1 clinical trial of  xxxd330xxx  administration
prior to and during  xxxd1832xxx  in patients with  xxxg2343xxx  to
determine the safety and tolerability of the combination.

patients and methods
patient population
patients aged 18 years and older with histopathologically confirmed  xxxg2343xxx 
were eligible for enrollment. all patients had to have progressive disease
after at least one systemic therapy other than steroids. patients previously
treated with  xxxd330xxx  were not eligible. all patients had an eastern
cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance status of 0 to 2.
consent forms approved by the tufts new england medical center
institutional review board were signed by all patients prior to therapy.
treatment plan
 xxxd330xxx  was administered by cohort dose escalation at daily doses of 75,
150, 225, or 300 mg/day beginning 7 days before the first dose of denileukin
diftitox. once begun,  xxxd330xxx  was taken by mouth daily throughout the
course of treatment. the initial goal was accrual of 3 patients into each

dose-cohort with the number of patients per cohort adjusted on the basis of
treatment tolerability and effect of  xxxd330xxx  pretreatment on cd25
expression. no prophylactic  xxxd1724xxx  or thyroid therapy was administered
in this study. plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and serum thyroxin levels
were measured at every study visit. atorvastatin (pfizer, new york, ny)
and levothyroxine (abbott, abbott park, il) were administered for
evidence of hyperlipidemia or hypothyroidism, respectively. denileukin
diftitox was initiated on day 8 at a dose of 18 mcg/kg per day for 3 doses
every 21 days.  xxxd1832xxx  was infused over 40 to 60 minutes on day
1 of the first cycle, and if well tolerated, was given over an infusion time of
at least 15 minutes for subsequent doses. daily premedication included 8
mg intravenous dexamethasone, 25 mg to 50 mg diphenhydramine given
orally, and 650 mg acetaminophen given orally. patients were treated with
at least 4 cycles of therapy or until best response or response plateau.
response was determined based on skin scoring and on overall disease
burden, including measurement of adenopathy and blood involvement.
photographs were taken at baseline and at response or progression.

response

cd25 expression assessment

the combination of  xxxd330xxx  and  xxxd1832xxx  was well
tolerated with few grade 3 and 4 adverse events. one patient
experienced a hypersensitivity reaction consisting of hives following  xxxd1832xxx  infusion, which resolved with corticosteroids and antihistamine treatment. five of the 14 patients developed peripheral edema; one of these 5 patients became hypotensive
as a result of vascular leak syndrome, and the other 4 patients
required diuresis for relief of symptoms.
all other adverse events were laboratory abnormalities, with no
associated clinical symptoms. grade 3 leukopenia was noted in one
patient. grade 3 and 4 lymphopenia was noted in 8 patients and
resolved before the next cycle of  xxxd1832xxx . there were no
dose reductions for hematologic toxicity. one patient developed
grade 4 hyperlipidemia after the first cycle of therapy, requiring
discontinuation from the study. overall, 12 patients experienced
hypertriglyceridemia that occurred even at the lowest  xxxd330xxx 
dosage. hypertriglyceridemia was managed with lipid-lowering
agents. patients did not receive prophylactic  xxxd1724xxx  agents prior
to dosing with  xxxd330xxx . nine patients experienced hypothyroidism as determined by subnormal t4 levels and received thyroid
hormone replacement therapy. a summary of clinical adverse
events and laboratory abnormalities observed in this study is
reported in tables 2 and 3.

only the cd25 component of the  xxxg1175xxx  was evaluated. cd25 expression
was assessed by immunohistochemistry (ihc) or flow cytometry at
baseline prior to  xxxd330xxx  administration, after 7 days of  xxxd330xxx 
administration and prior to the first dose of  xxxd1832xxx , and then
prior to each subsequent course of  xxxd1832xxx .

results
patients and treatment

fourteen patients with  xxxg2343xxx  were enrolled in the study. median
age was 62 years (range, 46-81 years). there were 8 women and 6
men. seven patients had stage i-iia disease, one had stage iib, 3
had stage iii, one had stage iva, and 2 had stage ivb. median
number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 1-11). one patient who had
received  xxxd1832xxx  prior to this study had not achieved a
partial response after 8 cycles of therapy. this was a cohort
dose-escalation study with doses of  xxxd330xxx  ranging from 75
mg/day to 300 mg/day. only one patient received a dose of 75 mg,
and as no upregulation of  xxxg1175xxx  was seen in this patient no further
patients were accrued at this dose. five patients received a dose of
150 mg daily, 4 patients received 225 mg daily, 3 patients received
300 mg daily, and one patient received a dose of 375 mg daily. the
number of cycles of  xxxd1832xxx  received by each patient
varied, ranging from 1 to 12 and was determined by clinical
response and toxicity. the median number of cycles was 4. table 1
summarizes patient demographics and treatments given.

twelve of the 14 patients were evaluable for response. patient 9
was not evaluable for clinical response because of lack of
compliance with study protocol. specifically, she did not return for
any follow-up visits for several months after receiving her first
 xxxd1832xxx  treatment. patient 13 was not evaluable because
the  xxxd330xxx  treatment had to be quickly discontinued after the
first cycle of therapy due to the precipitous onset of hypertriglyceridemia. of the remaining 12 patients, 4 had a complete response to
treatment and 4 had a partial response, for an overall objective
response rate of 67%. the one patient who had failed to respond to
prior  xxxd1832xxx  therapy had a complete response (table 1,
patient no. 8).

and/or 7 days after treatment with  xxxd330xxx . upregulation of
cd25 expression was defined as a 50% increase in cd25
expression from baseline levels of fluorescence as detected by flow
cytometry in gated populations of cd4⫹ cd7⫺ lymphocytes and
was noted in 8 of the 12 evaluable patients (table 4). all 4 patients
who achieved a complete response and 1 of the 3 patients who
achieved a partial response had evidence of cd25 upregulation
after  xxxd330xxx  treatment.

discussion
 xxxd1832xxx  and  xxxd330xxx  are both approved therapies for
patients with persistent or recurrent  xxxg2343xxx . this is the first trial to
explore the safety of these 2 agents when used in combination, and
to assess cd25 upregulation on  xxxg2343xxx  cells with  xxxd330xxx . we
observed no overlapping toxicities and no maximum-tolerated dose
was determined, probably because the biologic end point of
upregulation of cd25 expression on circulating cd4⫹ tumor cells
was reached at a relatively low dose of  xxxd330xxx  and appeared to
be dose independent at doses equal to or greater than 150 mg/day.
the most significant adverse events were those already reported
with  xxxd330xxx  alone. hypertriglyceridemia occurred even at the

lowest doses of  xxxd330xxx  and was not dose dependent in this
small group of patients. three patients (21%) experienced triglyceride elevations of more than 1000 mg/dl (grade 3-4), and 4 had
cholesterol elevations of more than 300 mm/l (grade 2). the
incidence of lipid anomalies in this study is comparable to that
observed in larger trials of  xxxd330xxx  in  xxxg2343xxx .10,11 similarly,
suppression of thyroid function due to decreased tsh production
occurred in 9 (64%) of 14 patients, an incidence comparable to the
54% incidence of thyroid stimulation hormone (tsh) suppression
that was reported with oral  xxxd330xxx  administered at a dose of
300 mg/m2 per day.12
grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia occurred in 8 (57%) of 14 patients in
this trial. in the phase 3 trial of  xxxd1832xxx  in  xxxg2343xxx , the
incidence of grade 3 or 4 leukopenia was 16% and the incidence of
grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia was 3.6%.7 in the phase 3 studies of
 xxxd330xxx  in patients with advanced and refractory  xxxg2343xxx , the
incidences of grade 2 and 3 leukopenia at a dose of 300 mg/m2 per
day, which is almost twice the highest dose administered in this
study, were 7.1% and 3.6%, respectively, and there was no grade 4
leukopenia.11 the incidence of grade 3 lymphopenia with the
combination of  xxxd330xxx  and  xxxd1832xxx  was 40%.
because the relationship between  xxxd330xxx  dose and lymphopenia has not been well established, it is difficult to ascertain whether

the incidence reported here is consistent with an rxr effect or if it
may represent an interaction between  xxxd330xxx  and denileukin
diftitox. however, as noted in table 3, 9 of 14 patients had grade 2
or higher lymphopenia prior to beginning therapy, and 4 of those
patients had grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia. this may account, in part,
for the lymphopenia observed in this study. in terms of clinical
significance, the lymphopenia was short-lived, resolving within
one month of cessation of therapy, and no patient developed
evidence of opportunistic infection while on therapy or in the 6
months thereafter.
in this study,  xxxd1832xxx  was administered at a dose
intensity (18 mcg/kg per day ⫻ 3 days, or 54 mcg/kg per cycle)
comparable to the lower dose studied in the pivotal phase 3
protocol, where the doses evaluated were 9 mcg/kg per day or 18
mcg/kg per day ⫻ 5 days, for a total of 45 mcg/kg per cycle or 90
mcg/kg per cycle. the incidence of peripheral edema attributable to
low-level vascular leak was similar in both studies (28% vs 27% in
the phase 3 study), but the incidence of significant hepatic
transaminase elevations (⬎ 5⫻ normal) was significantly lower in
this trial (0% vs 17%). infusion-related events associated with

457

 xxxd1832xxx  occurred infrequently in this study compared
with the phase 3 trial, probably due to corticosteroid premedication
used in this trial.13
in this small series, the objective response rate was 67%, with a
complete response rate and a partial response rate of 33% each.
although the number of patients treated in this study was small, the
overall response rate appears to be higher than that reported with
either  xxxd330xxx  or  xxxd1832xxx  administered as a single
agent in comparable groups of patients with  xxxg2343xxx . of interest, one
patient who did not respond to  xxxd1832xxx  alone had a
complete response on this trial to the combination of denileukin
diftitox and  xxxd330xxx , suggesting that this combination therapy
may be useful in patients who experience a suboptimal or plateau
response to  xxxd1832xxx .
the higher response rates observed here may be related to the
effects of  xxxd330xxx  on expression of  xxxg1175xxx . cd25 expression
was increased after 1 week of  xxxd330xxx  therapy in 8 of 13 patients
treated at doses of at least 150 mg/day. of these, 6 patients with
circulating sezary cells demonstrated upregulation of cd25 expression on the tumor cells. two of 13 patients had low numbers of
circulating cd4⫹cd7⫺ cells and had evidence of upregulation of
cd25 on normal populations of cd4⫹ cells after  xxxd330xxx .
although our sample size is limited, we conclude that  xxxd330xxx 
likely increases cd25 expression on both sezary cells and normal
cd4⫹ subsets. because of the small sample size, no definite
correlations can be drawn between upregulation of cd25 expression and clinical response, and likewise, the effects of  xxxd330xxx 
on normal immune effector cells, including immunoregulatory t
cells, have not been elucidated and could potentially impact the
biologic and clinical activity of this drug combination.
in conclusion, we report that the combination of denileukin
diftitox and  xxxd330xxx  is associated with an acceptable safety
profile and a high overall response rate in patients with early and
advanced refractory cutaneous t-cell lymphoma and that low doses
of  xxxd330xxx  are capable of modulating expression of cd25 in
vivo. the impact of the upregulation of  xxxg1175xxx  by  xxxd330xxx  on the
clinical efficacy of  xxxd1832xxx  should be further pursued in
the context of a randomized clinical trial.
