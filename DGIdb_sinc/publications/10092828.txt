elimination of the immunogenicity of therapeutic antibodies.  the immunogenicity of therapeutic abs limits their long-term use. the processes of complementarity-determining region grafting, resurfacing, and hyperchimerization diminish mab immunogenicity by reducing the number of foreign residues. however, this does not prevent anti-idiotypic and anti-allotypic responses following repeated administration of cell-binding abs. classical studies have demonstrated that monomeric  xxxd2207xxx  is profoundly tolerogenic in a number of species. if cell-binding abs could be converted into monomeric non-cell-binding tolerogens, then it should be possible to pretolerize patients to the therapeutic cell-binding form. we demonstrate that non-cell-binding minimal mutants of the anti- xxxg393xxx  ab  xxxd107xxx  lose immunogenicity and can tolerize to the "wild-type" ab in  xxxg393xxx -expressing transgenic mice. this finding could have utility in the long-term administration of therapeutic proteins to humans.
