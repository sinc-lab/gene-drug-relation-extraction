abstract--experiments conducted on membrane fractions of guinea-pig brain using ligand-binding
techniques have shown that certain ca:+-antagonists interact with histamine (h t or hz) receptors.
 xxxd2125xxx  (inhibition constant, ki ~ 86 nm) was nearly as potent as diphenhydramine (k~ ~ 44 nm) in
inhibiting [ xxxd3050xxx  binding to cerebellar hrreceptors, whereas verapamil, d 600 and nifedipine did
not interact with this site. regarding [3h]tiotidine binding to h2-receptors of cerebral cortex, verapamil
(ki ~ 1400 nm) and d 600 (ki ~ 1240 nm) were nearly as potent as cimetidine (ki ~ 910 nm) whereas
 xxxd2125xxx  and nifedipine were inactive. the interaction of ftunarizine with hrreceptors might explain,
in part, its sedative side-effect. the interaction of verapamil with h2-receptors , demonstrated here for the
first time, might be involved in the anti-arrhythmic action of this agent.

"ca2+-antagonists '' or "slow ca 2+ channel blockers", a group of vasodilators that are used clinically
to treat angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias and
hypertension, share one c o m m o n p r o p e r t y - - a n
inhibitory effect on slow inward ca 2÷ current in
vascular smooth muscle, cardiac muscle and in
some other tissues (fleckenstein, 1977). however,
members of this heterogeneous group of substances
also have other potent pharmacological actions; e.g.
the recently-reported anti-serotonin-2 (anti-5-ht0
actions of verapamil and methoxyverapamil (d 600)
(auguet et al., 1984, 1985; taylor and defeudis,
1984); the anti-histamine-1 (anti-h 0 action of  xxxd2125xxx  (ivo caers, 1982). also, verapamil interacts
weakly with opiate receptors, cq-adrenoceptors and
muscarinic cholinergic receptors (see e.g. reviews by
triggle and swamy, 1983; janis and scriabine, 1983).
further characterization of these other properties of
ca2+-antagonists should be useful in explaining both
their therapeutic actions and their side-effects, as well
as in providing rationale for examining their actions
in other systems. in line with this view, we have used
the ligand-binding method to study the possible
interactions of four ca:+-antagonists with h~- and
h2-receptors of cerebral membrane preparations.

experimental procedures

tissue preparation

male, hartley guinea-pigs (250-300 g) were sacrificed by
decapitation. their brains were excised, dissected over ice,
and stored at -80°c until assay. membrane fractions of
cerebral cortex and cerebellum were prepared by homogenizing the tissues in ice-cold na+/k+-phosphate buffer
(50mm, ph 7.4) with a polytron pt-10 (setting 6, 15 s),
followed by centrifugation at 39,000g for 10min. supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were again homogenized and centrifuged. final pellets were re-suspended in 79
vol. (cerebellum; h~ assay) or 19 vol. (cerebral cortex; h 2
assay) of buffer and used immediately for ligand-binding
assays.
binding assays

to determine hi-receptor binding (chang et al., 1979),
aliquots (0.8 ml) of cerebellar membrane preparation were
added to culture tubes containing 2.0 nm of [ xxxd3050xxx 
([3h] xxxd3050xxx ; 24.1 ci/mmol, new england nuclear
corp., boston, mass.) and various concentrations of the
unlabelled substances in a total volume of 1.0 ml. after a
30 min incubation at 25°c, the assays were terminated by
filtration through whatman gf/b filters under vacuum.
each tube and filter was washed three times with 5 ml of
ice-cold buffer, and the particle-bound radioactivity that
was trapped on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. all assays were performed in duplicate.
specific h~ binding was defined as the difference between the
total amount of [ xxxd3050xxx  bound and that portion of
[ xxxd3050xxx  that was bound in the presence of 2/~m
unlabelled triprolidine.

specific h 2 binding was assayed as previously described
(gajtkowski et al., 1983). aliquots of cerebral cortical
preparations were incubated with 2.0 nm of [3h]tiotidine
(75.4ci/mmol; new england nuclear) and the test substances for 30 rain at 25"c in a total volume of 0.25 ml.
assays were terminated as described above. specific binding
was defined as the difference between total [3h]tiotidine
bound and the amount that was bound in the presence of
i0/~m unlabelled cimetidine.
('alculat ions

inhibition constants (k~ values) were calculated using the
equation: k,=ics0/(i + l / k o ) , in which l is the radioligand concentration and kd is the appropriate equilibrium
dissociation constant (0.82 nm for [sh] xxxd3050xxx ; 12 nm
for ph]tiotidine). ics0 values and pseudo-hill coefficients
were derived from the data by linear least squares regression
analyses of the relation log ( b / b t - b ) vs /, where 1 is the
molar concentration of unlabelled substance, b t is the total
amount of radioligand specifically bound, and b is the
amount of radioligand bound in the presence of a given
concentration of inhibitor. for each k~determination, 4 or
5 different concentrations of test substances were used.
results and discussion
the data shown in table 1 indicate that  xxxd2125xxx 
is nearly as potent as d i p h e n h y d r a m i n e in inhibiting
[ xxxd3050xxx  binding to cerebellar h~-receptors. in
contrast, verapamil, d 600 and nifedipine did not
interact with this site. with regard to [3h]tiotidine
binding to h2-receptors o f cerebral cortex, d 600 and
verapamil were about as potent as cimetidine as
inhibitors, whereas  xxxd2125xxx  and nifedipine were
inactive.
these results have revealed that three substances
that are generally classified as "ca2+-antagonists '', or
more specifically as "slow ca 2~ channel blockers",
interact with h~-( xxxd2125xxx ) or he-receptors (d 600,
verapamil). the anti-h 1 action o f  xxxd2125xxx , which

is known from previous studies, might explain, in
part, its sedative side-effect (bowman and rand,
1980; ivo caers, 1982).
the interactions o f verapamil and d 600 with
h2-receptors represent a new finding. previous studies which have indicated that the arrhythmic response
to histamine in isolated ventricular papillary muscles
of guinea pig was inhibited by d 600 (senges et al.,
1977), and that histamine-induced oscillatory activity
in sheep purkinje fibers was abolished by verapamil
(mugelli e t al., 1980) receive support from this finding. however, in these earlier studies the actions o f d
600 or verapamil on histamine-induced responses
were attributed solely to their cae~-antagonistic
action. in this regard, it should be noted that the
positive inotropic and chronotropic actions, as well
as the arrhythmogenic activity of histamine, likely
involve its activation o f h2-receptors (levi et al.,
1975; owen, 1977). thus, if one considers that
nifedipine (which is at least as potent as verapamil in
blocking slow ca 2~ channels) is virtually devoid o f
anti-arrhythmic activity (vater e t al., 1972: ellrodt
and singh, 1983) and does not interact with h,receptors (see table 1), the results presented herein
might possibly have some relation to the clinical
effectiveness o f verapamil (and d 600) in the therapy
of certain cardiac arrhythmias. o f course, blockade
of the arrhythmogenic action o f ca: ~ appears to be
the major mechanism underlying the anti-arrhythmic
action o f verapamil (fleckenstein, 1977: opie, 1980:
stone e l al., 1980).
the interactions of verapamil and d 600 with
he-receptors (shown herein) and the recent demonstration that these agents are potent antagonists at
vascular and cerebral 5-ht2-receptors (auguet et al.,
1984, 1985: taylor and defeudis, 1984), indicate

ca2+-antagonists and histamine receptors
further that verapamil and d 600 cannot be classified
simply as "slow ca 2÷ channel blockers", or as selective "ca2+-antagonists ''. further biochemical and
physiological studies of the interactions of verapamil
and d 600 with h2-receptors and 5-ht2-receptors of
other tissues (e.g. heart, gastrointestinal tissues)
should help to explain the mechanisms underlying
their therapeutic actions and side-effects, as well as
offering sound rationale for testing these agents as
therapies for other disorders (e.g. cerebral vasospasm, migraine headache, certain gastrointestinal
problems) in which h 2- and 5-ht2-receptors are
involved.
