the pivotal role of interleukin-1 in the clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis.  the role of the cytokine network in mediating inflammation and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) has been investigated extensively in recent years. interleukin-1 (il-1) and  xxxg2296xxx  ( xxxg2296xxx ) are two pivotal proinflammatory cytokines that have been shown to contribute to the clinical manifestations of ra. the ability of il-1 to drive inflammation and joint erosion and to inhibit tissue repair processes has been clearly established in in vitro systems and animal models. under physiological conditions, the activity of il-1 is balanced by  xxxd2806xxx  ( xxxg1171xxx  alpha). understanding of the respective roles of il-1 and  xxxg1171xxx  alpha in conditions of health and disease has led to the development of a recombinant  xxxg1172xxx , anakinra (kineret; amgen inc., thousand oaks, ca), which offers a new therapeutic modality for ra.
