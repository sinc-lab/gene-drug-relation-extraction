heroin dependence

background: heroin dependence is associated with a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, proposed as a biological
correlate of craving. maintenance treatment with methadone normalizes hpa axis activity. here, we examined hpa axis activity under
maintenance treatment with the increasingly utilized partial opiate agonist buprenorphine.
methods: responses to a  xxxd2633xxx  challenge were compared in 20 buprenorphine-maintained heroin addicts and 20 healthy volunteers (10 received a single 50 mg naltrexone dose [ntx⫹] and 10 received no naltrexone [ntx⫺]). patients were 16 male subjects and 4
female subjects, aged 30 to 38 years, heroin-dependent and relapse-free under buprenorphine maintenance (bup) for a minimum of 6
months. healthy volunteers were 9 male subjects and 11 female subjects, aged 36 to 49 years, with no history of dependence. serial
measures were obtained of plasma  xxxg1801xxx  (acth) and cortisol and profile of mood states (poms) ratings over time.
subjects were genotyped for the  xxxg1635xxx  118a/g polymorphism.
results: buprenorphine maintenance showed a dampened hpa axis response to  xxxd2633xxx , with  xxxg1635xxx  118g carriers showing a
significantly attenuated response compared with 118a carriers. the response of the ntx⫹ group was markedly increased. in contrast,
negative affect was elevated in the bup group but did not differ between ntx⫺ and ntx⫹. buprenorphine maintenance and ntx⫺ groups
did not differ in positive affect, whereas the ntx⫹ group was lower.
conclusions: in contrast to exaggerated hpa axis responsiveness reported in untreated heroin dependence, response to  xxxd2633xxx  was
subnormal in heroin addicts maintained on buprenorphine. despite this, increased measures of negative affect were seen in this group. this
implies a dissociation of hpa axis responsiveness and affect in heroin dependence.

r

ecruitment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa)
axis has been proposed as a biological substrate for
craving and relapse in heroin dependence (1,2). in animal
experiments, intermittent escalating morphine doses, a pattern
resembling human heroin abuse, result in elevated basal  xxxg1801xxx  (acth) and corticosterone levels (3). a
similar basal acth and glucocorticoid elevation, which persists
beyond the immediate withdrawal period, has been reported in
human heroin addicts and was accompanied by blunted responses to emotional stimuli (4). opioid receptors exert inhibitory control over hpa axis output, in part through inhibition of
hypothalamic  xxxg517xxx  (crh) (2). repeated withdrawals rather than opiate taking per se are therefore
likely to cause hpa axis dysregulation in opioid dependence. on
the street, short-acting opioids such as heroin are taken intermittently, setting the scene for repeated cycles of withdrawal.
the hippocampal formation provides negative feedback control of the hpa axis, while prolonged hippocampal exposure to
high glucocorticoid levels during chronic stress results in loss of
hippocampal volume (5). this is initially thought to occur due to
loss of dendritic arborization but ultimately may involve irrevers-

ible neuronal degeneration. also, stress inhibits hippocampal
neurogenesis in rodents and nonhuman primates (6). loss of
hippocampal volume results in a vicious circle of excessive
glucocorticoid production, in which the hpa axis further escapes
its normal regulation and becomes chronically hyperactive. in
humans, several stress-related pathological conditions, including
depression, cushing’s disease, and posttraumatic stress disorder
(ptsd), are associated with hippocampal atrophy (7). it is
presently unknown whether this also occurs in heroin dependence.
in addition to hpa axis recruitment, neuroadaptations encompassing extrahypothalamic crh systems have been postulated in the pathophysiology of substance dependence (8,9).
independently of the hpa axis, crh antagonists block excessive
drug taking and stress-induced relapse to drug seeking (9), as
well as stress-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking (10).
 xxxg517xxx  systems within the extended
amygdala are likely to mediate these actions. in contrast to
hypothalamic crh, which is under negative feedback control
from glucocorticoids, crh expression and function within the
extended amygdala are positively regulated by stress and glucocorticoids (11,12). also, stressors that cause dendritic atrophy
in the hippocampus cause extension of neuronal processes in the
amygdala (13) and in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (14).
extrahypothalamic crh is not directly involved in regulation of
acth secretion but instead mediates behavioral stress responses. recruitment of crh signaling in the extended amygdala
is an antireward process postulated to drive the progression from
impulsive to compulsive drug use (9).
two processes might thus act in concert in heroin dependence. initial chronic hpa axis hyperactivity may lead to an
escape from hippocampal negative feedback control. this, in

turn, may drive a feedforward of crh activity within the extended amygdala, resulting in escalating drug seeking and taking. of interest for this framework, maintenance treatment with
the full opiate agonist methadone (mmt) can normalize hpa axis
activity in heroin addicts, and this mechanism has been suggested as a possible factor contributing to its therapeutic efficacy
(15). more recently, therapeutic efficacy in heroin dependence
has also been demonstrated with the partial opioid agonist
buprenorphine (16,17). it is presently unknown whether this
compound shares with methadone an ability to dampen a
hyperactive hpa axis in heroin addicts. finally, the opioid
antagonist naltrexone is also used in heroin dependence, but
results in unselected patients are not encouraging (18). inability
of naltrexone to substitute for rewarding properties of heroin
presumably contributes to its limited therapeutic efficacy. however, an interesting possibility is that hpa axis activation by
naltrexone (19) also contributes to this.
in summary, it has been proposed that a normalization of
pathological hpa axis reactivity is important for clinical efficacy
in treatment of heroin dependence. the documented ability of
mmt to achieve such normalization is clearly consistent with this
proposition. however, the lack of other effective treatments for
heroin dependence has, until recently, restricted opportunities to
evaluate whether this reflects a general mechanism. evidence
now available for a clinical efficacy of buprenorphine offers an
opportunity to independently examine the possible link between
hpa axis normalization and clinical efficacy in heroin dependence. here, we therefore investigated hpa axis reactivity after
maintenance treatment with buprenorphine, using the  xxxd2633xxx  challenge (20). for comparison, hpa axis reactivity was
examined after an acute dose of naltrexone. to assess a possible
correlation between neuroendocrine response and negative affect, mood ratings were obtained in parallel with hormone levels.
finally, because genetic variation at the ␮-opioid receptor gene
( xxxg1635xxx ) (21) is associated with heroin dependence (22) and
differential hpa axis reactivity (23), we assessed the contribution
of this variant to our results.

methods and materials
the study was approved by the karolinska south human
subjects ethics committee (dnr 374/03). all subjects received
written and oral information and gave their informed consent as
approved by the ethics committee. twenty buprenorphinemaintained heroin-dependent subjects (daily dose in all cases
16 –36 mg except for one subject on 4 mg) were recruited by
word of mouth at a large clinic for pharmacologically assisted
treatment of heroin dependence in stockholm. these subjects
had been stable in treatment for 6 months or longer and were
relapse-free as documented by negative weekly supervised urine
toxicology. urine samples were analyzed and found to be
negative for illicit opiates, cannabinoids, central stimulants, and
benzodiazepines. cocaine was not routinely analyzed, since it is
almost never encountered in this population. twenty healthy
volunteers with no history of any substance use disorder (with
the exception of allowing presence of nicotine dependence) and
not using any prescription drugs were recruited by word of
mouth among health care professionals. subjects were compensated by receiving gift certificates worth 1000 swedish krona
(sek) (approximately $120) on completion of the study.
to assess the endocrine stress response, the standard  xxxd2633xxx  challenge was carried out, as described previously (20).
in brief, subjects were instructed to receive nothing by mouth

except water for at least 9 hours before testing. at 8:00 am of the
testing day, they arrived at the research unit, were given an
intravenous (iv) line, and were allowed bed rest. at 9:00 am, 2.25
grams of  xxxd2633xxx  ( xxxd2633xxx , novartis, basel, switzerland)
was administered orally with 30 cc of an oral antacid to minimize
gastrointestinal upset.  xxxd1891xxx :00 am, buprenorphine-maintained
subjects received their regular buprenorphine dose, while 10 of
the healthy volunteers who had been randomized to single dose
naltrexone received 50 mg of this compound by mouth (po) in
an unblinded fashion. subjects were allowed to eat at 11:00 am.
subjects who were smokers were not permitted to smoke until
1:00 pm. blood samples for plasma acth and cortisol levels were
obtained at 9:00 am (just before  xxxd2633xxx  administration) and
at 1:00 pm (prior to allowing any smoking) and 5:00 pm, i.e., 4 and
8 hours later. blood was drawn into sodium ethylenediamine
tetraacetic acid (edta) vacutainer tubes and stored on ice for up
to 40 min until centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. plasma was
then removed, aliquoted, and stored at ⫺40°c until assayed.
samples were analyzed according to regular clinical routine by
the swedac accredited clinical chemistry laboratory of the
karolinska university hospital.
at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours following administration of  xxxd2633xxx , assessment of mood was carried out using the established
profile of mood states (poms) self-report instrument (24). this
instrument is thought to assess transient (state-dependent) mood
changes, originally divided into six dimensions: depression,
tension-anxiety, anger, fatigue, confusion, and vigor.
dna was purified from whole blood using standard methods.
genotyping of the single nucleotide polymorphism (snp)
118a/g or asn40asp (rs1799971) was performed by a taqman
allelic discrimination assay using the abi prism 7900ht sequence detection system (applied biosystems inc., foster city,
california) following the manufacturer’s protocol. briefly, 10 ng
dna was amplified in a final volume of 10 ␮l containing .5 ␮l
of 20x mgb probe and primers and 5 ␮l of 2x taqman universal
pcr master mix in a 384-well microplate format (applied biosystems inc.). amplification conditions were 50°c for 2 min then
95°c for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°c for 15 sec and
60°c for 1 min. fifteen percent of the samples were genotyped in
duplicates as a quality check, with complete concordance.
statistica 7.0 (statsoft, tulsa, oklahoma) was used for all
analyses. cortisol and acth data were analyzed separately, in
each case using the general linear model module, with repeated
hormone values as a within-subjects factor, group and sex as
between-subjects factors, and age, body mass index (bmi), and
buprenorphine dose (the latter on analyses within buprenorphine patient group only) as covariates. profile of mood states
scores were subjected to a factor analysis. principal component
factors were extracted and rotated using normalized varimax
rotation. repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) was
carried out, with factor scores on the respective factor as
dependent variable, time as repeated measures/within-subjects
factor, and group as between-subjects factor.

association study in mind, the frequency of the  xxxg1635xxx  118g
allele was 20.0% in heroin-dependent subjects but only 7.5% in
healthy volunteers, yielding a trend for a statistical significance
(␹2 ⫽ 2.64; p ⫽ .10). to evaluate whether the different 118g
allele frequency contributed to the  xxxd2633xxx  challenge results
and psychological ratings, all analyses were replicated excluding
118g carriers, and the contribution of genotype was further
explored in some secondary analyses as described below.
adequate suppression of cortisol production by  xxxd2633xxx 
administration is shown in figure 1. age and bmi were not
significant covariates and were therefore dropped from the final
analysis. the most robust effect was the main, within-subjects
effect for change of cortisol over time [f (2,32) ⫽ 90.6, p ⬍ .0001].
there was also a main affect of group [f (2,32) ⫽ 14.8, p ⬍ .0001]
and of sex [f (2,32) ⫽ 13.4, p ⬍ .001], but this did not interact with
the  xxxd2633xxx  effects, leading to the conclusion that  xxxd2633xxx -induced suppression of cortisol did not affect the groups
differentially. within the buprenorphine-maintained group, the
daily dose of buprenorphine was evaluated as a potential
covariate and did not affect the cortisol response [f (1,17) ⫽ .2,
p ⫽ .7]. the results of these analyses were very similar when
repeated excluding 118g carriers (data not shown).
differential acth response to the  xxxd2633xxx  challenge is
shown in figure 2a. for the acth response, age and bmi were
not significant as covariates and were therefore dropped from the
final analysis. similarly, sex was not a significant factor and was
therefore also dropped. there was a significant response of
acth to the  xxxd2633xxx  challenge [f (2,74) ⫽ 36.7, p ⬍ .0001]
and main effect of group [f (2,37) ⫽ 17.9, p ⬍ .0001]. most
importantly, a differential response of acth between the groups
was shown by a highly significant interaction term [f (4,74) ⫽ 7.5,
p ⬍ .0001]. post hoc comparison using newman-keuls test
showed that both the naltrexone (p ⫽ .001) and the buprenorphine (p ⫽ .027) groups differed from the control group. within
the buprenorphine-maintained group, the daily dose of buprenorphine was evaluated as a covariate and did not significantly affect the acth response [f (1,18) ⫽ .7, p ⫽ .4].
following exclusion of 118g carriers, response over time
[f (2,58) ⫽ 31.2, p ⬍ .0001], main effect of group [f (2,28) ⫽ 14.0,
p ⫽ .00006], and the interaction [f (4,58) ⫽ 5.3, p ⫽ .001]
remained significant. however, on post hoc analysis, the naltrexone group still robustly differed from both untreated control
subjects (p ⫽ .002) and buprenorphine-maintained subjects (p ⫽
.0002), but the buprenorphine-maintained group and untreated
control subjects no longer differed (p ⫽ .15, ns).
the contribution of the 118g allele to the acth response was
supported by secondary analyses within the group of buprenorwww.sobp.org/journal

phine-maintained heroin addicts. controlling for buprenorphine
dose, age, bmi, and sex, there was within this group a significant
main effect of genotype [f (1,13) ⫽ 5.6, p ⫽ .03] and a highly
significant interaction between genotype and the time course of
acth response over time [f (2,26) ⫽ 8.9, p ⫽ .001]. in fact, as
seen from the figure, 118g carriers simply lacked an acth
response to the  xxxd2633xxx  challenge (figure 2b).
for poms data, a scree plot indicated that a three-factor
solution best described the underlying structure in our data.
these three factors together explained 46.2% of the variance.
first, a factor that accounted for 17.4% of the variance received
loadings from items on the vigor subscale of the poms, which
reflect elevated mood, vigor, or energy. we hereafter label it
“positive affect.” all results reported below were virtually identical whether scores on the traditional vigor subscale or scores on
the positive affect factor were used, but the residual variance was
consistently lower using the latter, which was therefore ultimately used for the analysis. second, a factor which accounted
for 17.1% of the variance received loadings from items on the
depression, tension-anxiety, and anger subscales, which in our
extraction were highly correlated, similar to what has been
published in some other populations (e.g., 25). given the high
degree of correlation between these measures, analyzing them as
independent outcomes was considered inappropriate. instead,
this composite factor was labeled “negative affect” and was used
for all subsequent analyses. third, a factor contributing 11.7% of
the variance received loadings from items on both the fatigue
and confusion subscales, which again were highly correlated.
this factor was not of interest for the current study and was not
further analyzed.
analysis of variance of factor scores on negative affect yielded
a highly significant group effect [f (2,148) ⫽ 9.8, p ⫽ .0001]. post
hoc analysis using newman-keuls test showed that the buprenorphine-maintained group differed from both untreated
control subjects (p ⫽ .002) and naltrexone-treated healthy subjects (p ⫽ .001), which in turn were indistinguishable (p ⫽ .98).
there was no main effect for change of scores on this factor over
time [f (3,148) ⫽ 1.4, p ⫽ .24], nor was there any interaction
between group and time [f (6,148) ⫽ .14, p ⫽ .99]. when this
analysis was repeated excluding 118g carriers, results remained
virtually identical (data not shown). negative affect scores for the
three groups over time are shown in figure 3.

figure 2. (a) differential acth response to the  xxxd2633xxx  challenge in the three experimental groups. there was a highly significant main effect of group
(p ⬍ .0001), and a differential response of acth between the groups was shown by a highly significant interaction between acth over time ⫻ group (p ⬍
.0001). both the naltrexone-treated healthy volunteer group (p ⫽ .001) and the group of buprenorphine-maintained heroin addicts (p ⫽ .027) differed from
the control group. the significant suppression of the acth response to  xxxd2633xxx  in buprenorphine-maintained subjects was eliminated by the removal of
 xxxg1635xxx  118g allele carriers (p ⫽ .15, ns). this indicated that 118g carriers, who were overrepresented in the heroin-dependent group, contributed to the result.
this group was therefore further analyzed in panel b. (b) analysis of acth response to  xxxd2633xxx  as a function of  xxxg1635xxx  118a/g genotype within the group
of buprenorphine-maintained heroin addicts. a significant main effect of 118a/g genotype was seen (n ⫽ 14 and n ⫽ 6, respectively; p ⫽ .03) and interacted

analysis of variance of factor scores on positive affect also

naltrexone group deviated from the other two groups (p ⫽ .04 vs.

change of scores on this factor over time [f (3,148) ⫽ .3, p ⫽ .80],
nor was there any interaction between group and time
[f (6,148) ⫽ .50, p ⫽ .81]. when this analysis was rerun excluding
118g allele carriers, results were similar. the main group effect

reporting psychological ratings to investigate a potential link
between neuroendocrine response and mood. the buprenorphine-maintained heroin addicts showed an attenuated hpa axis
response to  xxxd2633xxx  compared with control subjects,
whereas the response of the group that received naltrexone was
markedly increased. in contrast, negative affect did not differ
between the untreated control group and the group of healthy
volunteers given naltrexone but was more intense in the buprenorphine group. the buprenorphine and the control groups
did not differ in positive affect, whereas naltrexone-treated
healthy volunteers reported lower scores on this dimension.
our study indicates that the exaggerated hpa axis response to
 xxxd2633xxx  previously reported in untreated heroin dependence
is normalized by 6 months of successful buprenorphine maintenance. the buprenorphine finding is in agreement with previous
data indicating a similar ability of methadone to achieve such a
normalization (26). unexpectedly, the hpa axis response of our
buprenorphine-maintained subjects to  xxxd2633xxx  was actually
subnormal, a pattern that is somewhat different from what has
typically been reported with methadone-maintained individuals,
although some studies have reported subnormal hpa axis responsiveness also in this population (27–29). the suppressed
 xxxd2633xxx  response in buprenorphine-maintained subjects was
found despite increased negative affect, as discussed below. it
has previously been reported that high neuroticism, a personality
trait characterized by increased propensity for negative affect,
results in an hpa axis response to naloxone challenge indicative
of adrenal hypertrophy. this is likely to reflect an integrated
history of excessive hpa axis activation in response to emotional
stimuli (30). although not directly comparable, our data indicate
that buprenorphine maintenance is capable of suppressing this
type of excessive endocrine stress responses despite the fact that
abnormal levels of negative affect persist. importantly, carriers of
the  xxxg1635xxx  118g allele contributed disproportionately to the
dampening of acth response in the buprenorphine-maintained
group and basically lacked a response to the challenge. the
 xxxg1635xxx  118a/g variation has previously been shown to confer
differential hpa axis response to naltrexone (23). the suggestive
finding of a more potent hpa axis suppression by buprenorphine in 118g carriers is in general agreement with these data
and can be thought of as their mirror image.
a single dose of the opiate antagonist naltrexone predictably
increased the activity of the hpa axis in healthy volunteers.
when designing the study, this group was included as a positive
control group. we did not investigate the effect of naltrexone in
heroin addicts because of the risk that a potentiation by naltrexone of  xxxd2633xxx -induced hpa axis activation may lead to
increased craving with subsequent increased risk for relapse.
however, the ability of naltrexone to activate the hpa axis was
established early on (19). this is presumably the result of
removing inhibitory tone of endogenous opioid peptides acting
to suppress hpa axis activity both at a pituitary and hypothalamic level (2). to the extent that exaggerated activation of the
hpa axis constitutes a risk factor for relapse, these data suggest
caution in treating heroin dependence with naltrexone. additional caution may be prompted by the present finding that
naltrexone administration suppressed positive mood. this may
in part be related to an ability of naltrexone to block ␮-opioid
receptors in the ventral tegmental area (vta), leading to a
decrease in dopaminergic tone (31,32), although other dopamine
independent mechanisms may also be involved (33,34). irrespective of mechanism, reduction of positive mood by naltrexone

j. kakko et al.
presumably is an undesirable effect and may be related to known
compliance issues with this medication.
a main finding of this study is an unexpected double dissociation of endocrine response and negative mood following
 xxxd2633xxx  challenge. thus, despite normalized hpa axis response, heroin-dependent subjects reported significantly higher
intensity of negative mood, while naltrexone-challenged normal
subjects, despite their excessively activated hpa axis, did not
differ in this parameter from untreated control subjects. this
pattern was independent of genotype. two things are important
to note with regard to the mood data. first, the mood effects
observed are likely to reflect group differences that were independent of the  xxxd2633xxx  challenge, since they were in both
cases detected as main effects of group in the absence of a
significant group ⫻ time interaction over the course of the
challenge session. secondly, corresponding data are to our
knowledge not available from methadone-maintained heroin
addicts. the following discussion is therefore restricted to the
dissociation between mood state and  xxxd2633xxx  responses
found under buprenorphine treatment.
we did not directly assess measures of craving, because this
would not be meaningful in healthy volunteers without a history
of opiate abuse. however, we measured negative affect, which
can be assessed in heroin addicts and healthy control subjects
alike and which in the former population has been shown to
correlate with craving for opiates and relapse (35–37). furthermore, recruitment of negative affect has recently been postulated
as an important antireward mechanism in the development of
addiction (9). our data suggest that a direct contribution of the
hpa axis to negative affect and craving related to this mood state
is unlikely. however, additional components of craving are
known to exist, which are unrelated to negative affect (38,39)
and could still be linked to hpa axis function. an alternative or
complementary possibility is that negative affect in heroindependent subjects is primarily the result of increased activity in
extrahypothalamic stress circuits that initially may result from but
over time become relatively independent of the exaggerated
hpa axis activity in these subjects. in particular, a recruitment of
crh signaling within the extended amygdala is a candidate
antireward mechanism that might initially be driven by a hyperactive hpa axis (11,12) but subsequently become largely
autonomous and contribute to a transition from impulsive to
compulsive drug use. dysregulation of this circuitry has been
hypothesized as being particularly slow to return to homeostasis
and may confer a negative affective state that persists long into
stable maintenance treatment (9). in addition to crh, serotonergic neuroadaptations could contribute to this process (40).
regardless of the relation between increased hpa activity and
craving for heroin, we have shown that buprenorphine does
normalize the otherwise hyperactive hpa axis in heroin dependence. given the potential for chronic hpa axis hyperactivity to
cause hippocampal and other pathology, this would appear to be
an important aspect of buprenorphine’s therapeutic properties.

this study was funded by the county of stockholm and by an
unrestricted research grant from schering-plough sweden. jk,
kds, and mh have received travel support and jk has received
honoraria from schering-plough sweden, the european distributor of subutex and suboxone, two preparations of buprenorphine for treatment of heroin dependence. there are no other
relationships to disclose.
