abstract. chick embryo skin fibroblasts release transforming growth factor [31 that is able to modulate glycosaminoglycan synthesis and secretion. when incubated
with individual classes of glycosaminoglycans, the factor's modulatory activity was altered. to determine
whether direct interactions between transforming growth
factor [31 and glycosaminoglycans occur, we have assessed the activity of the growth factor after pre-incubation with single classes of glycosaminoglycans by assaying its inhibitory effect upon the proliferative response
of thymocytes stimulated with interleukin-1. untreated
transforming growth factor ~1 suppressed the proliferative response of thymocytes to interleukin-1, as did
transforming growth factor [31 pre-incubated with sulphated glycosaminoglycans. by contrast, transforming
growth factor [31 lost its inhibitory capacity when preincubated with high molecular weight  xxxd2289xxx . digestion of transforming growth factor [31- xxxd2289xxx 
complex with hyaluronidase released active transforming growth factor [31. trypsin degraded transforming
growth factor [3! alone, but did not degrade the transforming growth factor [31- xxxd2289xxx  complex.
these results suggest that  xxxd2289xxx  interacts with
transforming growth factor [31, thus protecting the factor
from tryptic degradation and may be a means of concentrating growth factor activity.

introduction

transforming growth factor [3 (tgf[3) is a member of a
small group of growth regulators that can exert a variety
of effects depending upon the nature of target cells and
correspondence to: p. locci

the physiological conditions of tissues. tgf[3 stimulates
the production of the main extracellular matrix (ecm)
components such as collagen, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (gag) and fibronectin (ignotz and massagu6
1986; ignotz et al. 1987; rizzino 1988; roberts et al.
1988; locci et al. 1993) and also enhances the expression of integrins, receptors that mediate cellular interactions with ecm proteins in a variety of mammalian and
avian cell types (ignotz and massagu6 1987; roberts
and sporn 1990). tgf~ also inhibits expression of some
metalloproteases which are responsible for connective
tissue degradation (edwards et al. 1987). in addition, the
factor can exert inhibitory or stimulatory effects upon
the proliferation of several cell types (massaguh 1990;
moses 1991) and has been implicated in the regulation
of differentiation in several cell systems (heine et al.
1987).
tgf~ is expressed throughout embryogenesis and its
receptors are ubiquitously distributed. this, together
with its ability to control cell replication, cell differentiation, cell adhesion and ecm composition, suggests that
tgf[3 plays an important role in generating and modifying the extracellular molecular organization that guides
the morphogenic events of embryogenesis. indeed, it has
been found that expression of tgf[3 is high in sites undergoing intense development and morphogenesis (wilcox and derynck 1988; pelton et al. 1989; heine et al.
1990; sanders et al. 1993).
since different cell types express and respond to
tgf[3 in various ways, the existence of mechanisms that
tightly control its expression and activity might be expected. control of expression and activity may be executed by regulation of tgf~ gene transcription, by the
production of tgf[3 as a latent factor or by sequestration
of activated tgf[3 by the ecm and/or circulating proteins and/or cell surface receptors. once processed from
the latent to active form, tgf can be bound by various
extracellular matrix components, thereby protecting it
from the rapid cleavage and inactivation which is the
fate of the circulating activated factor (coffey et al.
1987). such growth factor-ecm interactions can occur

materials and methods

cell cultures
fragments of skin were carefully removed under sterile conditions
from the backs of 7- and 14-day-old chick embryos staged according to the hamburger-hamilton tables (hamilton, 1952), cut into
small pieces and dissociated in 0.25% trypsin (1/250; gibco, gaithersburg, md., usa) in ca ++- and mg++-free hanks'  xxxd2988xxx   xxxd3213xxx 
solution at room temperature for 30 min. the dissociated cells
were filtered through a nylon mesh, centrifuged (350 g, 10 min),
then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), ph 7.4, and
suspended in medium 199 plus 10% fetal calf serum (gibco). cell
suspension (lxl06 cells/ml) was plated in 25 cm 2 falcon plastic
flasks and incubated for 24 h in a humidity-saturated atmosphere
(5% co 2, 37~ to obtain confluent monolayer cultures.
cultures were monitored by use of a phase-contrast leitz inverted microscope. cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion assay (patterson 1979).

precipitation of newly synthesized gags
confluent cultures of 7- and 14-day-old chick embryo skin fibroblasts were washed with 0.9%  xxxg2020xxx  and cultured for 12 h in serum-free medium 199. this medium was discarded to avoid contamination by serum factors and exchanged for either medium 199
alone (control), or medium 199 plus: chondroitin 4- and 6-sulphate (cs, sigma chemical co. st. louis, usa) and dermatan
sulphate (ds, sigma) (each 100 gg/ml); 200 gg/ml of heparan
sulphate (hs, sigma); 200 gg/ml  xxxd2289xxx  (ha, m.w.
176 kd or 1200 kd, fidia s.p.a., padova, italy). a parallel set of
cultures was incubated in medium 199 plus tgf[~1 (4 ng/ml, gibco), or medium 199 supplemented with tgf~i which had been
pre-incubated with single classes of gag. for the latter, tgf~i
(4 ng/ml) was pre-incubated for 15 h at 37~ with 200 ~tg/ml of
ha m.w. 176 kd, ha m.w. 1200 kd, hs or cs+ds, and then
added to cultures. preliminary experiments demonstrated these
concentrations to be effective. all cultures were maintained for
24 h in the presence of 3 bci/ml 3h-glucosamine (s.a.
30 ci/mmol, nen du pont de nemours, germany). at the end of
the radiolabelling period, cells and media were recovered separately and gag precipitated as previously described (locci et al.

1992). incorporated radioactivity was measured and has been designated extracellular radioactivity (recovered in the medium) and
cellular radioactivity (recovered in the intra- and pericellular compartment).

interleukin-1 assay
the biological activity of tgfi31 was determined by use of the interleukin-1 (il-1) assay method described by ellingsworth et al.
(1988) and which uses thymocytes of 4-8-week-old c3h/hej
mice. briefly, thymocytes (30x106 cells/ml) were seeded in 96well microtiter plates in rpmi medium containing 10% calf serum, 10 mm hepes, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5x10 -5 m 2-[3- xxxd26xxx  and 50 mg/ml gentamicin. the cells were activated with
4 gg/ml phytohemagglutinin (pha, gibco) and il-1 (100 u/ml,
boehringer mannhein, germany) and cultured for 72 h in a 5%
co 2 humidified atmosphere at 37~ activated thymocytes were
subjected to either no treatment (control) or treatment with
0.5 ng/ml of tgf~i or 200 gg/ml of one of the following: ha
m.w. 1200 kd, ha m.w. 176 kd, hs, heparin (he, sigma) or
cs+ds. in a second set of cultures 0.5 ng/ml tgf[31 was pre-incubated at 37~ for 15 h with ha, hs, he or cs+ds at the above
concentrations prior to addition to the thymocytes. we have called
these compounds tgf~i-gag complexes. in a third set of cultures the tgf~i-ha (m.w. 1200 kd) complex was subjected to
the following treatments before addition to the cells: heating at
100~ for 5 min or enzymatic digestion. tgf~i-ha complex was
either digested for 45 min at 38~ with 336 u/ml streptomyces
hyaluronidase (hyase; miles biochemicals, elkhart, indiana) dissolved in the thymocyte medium (dorfman 1955), or for 1 h at
37~ with 50 gg/ml trypsin (gibco) dissolved in the same medium. after enzymatic digestion the complex was heated at 100~
for 5 min to inactivate the enzymes and then added to the cells.
all cultures were maintained for 72 h and pulsed with 2.5 gci/ml
of 3h-thymidine (s.a. 6.7 ci/mmol, nen) during the last 5 h of incubation. the cultures were harvested with a semiautomated cell
harvester and the amount of 3h-thymidine incorporation was determined by standard liquid scintillation methods. tgf[~l activity
was assessed as the ability to inhibit thymocyte proliferative responses.

tgffl activity in conditioned medium treated
and untreated with hyaluronidase
confluent 7-day-old chick embryo skin fibroblasts were washed
with physiological solution and cultured for 12 h in serum-free
medium 199. this medium was discarded to avoid contamination
by serum factors. cells were cultured for the next 24 h in 199
alone. conditioned medium (cm) was collected and centrifuged
for 10 min at 350 g to remove cell debris, dialyzed, lyophilized,
dissolved in the thymocyte medium (protein concentration
10-25-50 ~tg/ml) and used for the il-1 assay. an aliquot of cm
was treated with hyaluronidase (hyase; dorfman 1995) before being used for the assay.

protein determination
protein concentrations were determined by lowry assay (lowry
et al. 1951) of aliquots of cell lysates.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed using student's t-test. data are
expressed as the mean _+sd of one representative experiment chosen from two or three experiments performed in quadruplicate.

gag accumulations in the presence
of tgfflfgag complexes
to determine whether or not gag interferes with t g f ~
activity, the factor was added to 7-day-old fibroblasts either with or without preincubation in the presence of
several classes of gag (table 1). a comparison of 3hglucosamine incorporation in controls and treated cells
shows that administration of gag alone failed to affect
gag accumulation in either the cellular or extracellular
compartment. tgf~3~ treatment enhanced gag accumulation, more markedly in cells than in media (approximately 2.8-fo|d and 2.3-fold, respectively). when
t g f ~ was pre-incubated with gag prior to addition to
the cells, its ability to stimulate gag synthesis varied
depending upon the class of gag with which it was preincubated. 176 kd ha did not alter the stimulatory effect of the factor. 1200 kd ha, hs and cs+ds all par-

tgffl zactivity assays
tgf~31 inhibited the proliferative response of thymocytes to il-1 by approximately 94% (fig. 1, column 2),
while neither class of ha alone affected il-1 induction
of growth (columns 3 and 5). pre-incubation of tgf[51
with 176 kd ha did not alter the factor's inhibitory capacity (column 4), whereas pre-treatment with 1200 kd

ha almost completely relieved the inhibition (7% inhibition, column 6). digestion of the 1200 kd ha with
hyase prior to incubation with tgfi31, resulted in the
loss of its ability to relieve tgf[31 inhibition (91% inhibition, column 8). thus, only intact 1200 kd ha was
able to suppress the anti-proliferative action of tgfi31.
a further set of experiments was carried out in order
to determine the effects of hyase and heat treatment upon the tgf[31-1200 kd ha complex. as seen in fig. 2,
proliferation of thymocytes was only slightly inhibited
(18%) by the tgfi31-ha complex (column 3), but significantly inhibited (approximately 77%) by the hyasedigested tgfi31-ha complex (column 4). thus, digestion of 1200 kd ha with hyase before or after incubation with tgf~31 resulted in a loss of its ability to suppress tgf[31 inhibitory activity. heating did not affect
the activity of the tgfi31-ha complex (column 5).
next, experiments were performed to determine the
effect of proteolytic digestion upon the activity of free
tgf[31 and tgf~31-ha complex. fig. 3 shows that
tgff31 lost its inhibitory effect upon thymocyte proliferation when digested with trypsin before its addition to
cell cultures (column 3). trypsin digestion of tgf~iha complex did not show any effect upon the proliferative response of the cells activated with il-1 (column 5).
in this case, it was not clear whether the factor within
the complex was inactivated by trypsin digestion or was
unable to inhibit thymocyte growth because ha suppressed its anti-proliferative action. for clarification, the
trypsin-digested tgf[31-ha complex was subjected to
further digestion with hyase before being added to thymocytes (column 6). the doubly-digested complex inhibited thymocyte proliferation, thus showing that
tgf[~i was protected from tryptic digestion by the presence of ha in the tgf~31-ha complex. tgf~31-ha
complex, in which ha was pre-digested with hyase and
then incubated with tgf~3x, inhibited cell proliferation
(column 7), while digestion of this complex with trypsin
rendered it incapable of suppressing cell growth (column
8).
we also determined the effects of sulphated gag upon tgf~31 activity. fig. 4 shows that the addition of he,
hs or cs+ds to il-l-stimulated thymocytes had no effect upon cell proliferation (columns 3, 4 and 5). tgf~31
pre-incubated with hs, he or cs+ds had the same antiproliferative activity as untreated tgf~31 (columns 6, 7
and 8), thereby demonstrating that sulphated gag do
not modify the effect of tgf[31 upon thymocyte proliferative response.

tgffl activity in cm treated and untreated with hyase
cm, collected from 7-day-old chick embryo skin fibroblasts, inhibited il-l-stimulated thymocytes in a dosedependent manner (fig. 5). cm, protein concentration
10 and 25 gg/ml, treated with hyase before being added
to thymocytes, showed a significant increase in the inhibition of the mitogenic response of stimulated cells compared to untreated cm, demonstrating that enzymatic digestion released a new aliquot of tgfi3 which was able

to inhibit proliferative response. no differences were observed between cm, protein concentration 50 gg/ml, untreated and treated with hyase, since untreated cm gave
an inhibition of about 85%.
discussion

sulphated and unsulphated gag, accumulated in the extracellular matrix, not only affect ecm properties, but
often influence a wide variety of cellular processes via
cytokines (nathan and sporn 1991). it is well known
that  xxxg787xxx  ( xxxg787xxx ) binds strongly
to heparin. this interaction is a prerequisite for occupancy of the  xxxg787xxx  high-affinity cell surface receptor
(klagsbrun and baird 1991; rapraeger et al. 1991; yayon et al. 1991). moreover, several interleukins show selective binding to acidic polysaccharides (ramsden and
rider 1992) suggesting that, under many physiological
conditions, there is retention of these cytokines near the
site of their secretion through a low affinity binding interaction with gag. we have previously demonstrated
that tgf~ significantly increases cellular and extracellular gag accumulation in chick embryo skin fibroblasts
(locci et al. 1993).
to examine whether or not gag accumulation in the
ecm is able to modulate tgf[31 action, we have studied
the ability of ha and sulphated gag to interfere with
tgf~3a activity. our results show that the stimulatory effect of tgf~i upon embryonal fibroblast gag synthesis
and secretion was partially suppressed by the presence
of high molecular weight ha, hs and, to a lesser degree, cs+ds. it remained to be elucidated whether gag
interacted directly with the growth factor, such that it is
no longer available to high and low affinity receptors, or
whether activity was reduced by some other means. to
this end, tgfi31 was incubated with single classes of
gag and its activity assayed on il-l-stimulated thymocytes. tgf~31 alone inhibited il-l-induced cell proliferation, and incubation with all of the sulphated gag tested failed to modify its inhibitory activity. thus, it is likely that sulphated gag do not interact directly with
tgf~31, but they may modulate its activity by altering
ecm composition, thereby controlling the activity of associated growth factors (nugent and edelman 1992). it
is well known that  xxxg787xxx  ( xxxg787xxx )
binds either to the hs chains of the membrane hs proteoglycan or to free hs chains prior to binding to its receptors (yayon et al. 1991). the binding may change the
conformation of  xxxg787xxx  so that it acquires the ability to
bind to its receptors. platelet-derived growth factor
(pdgf) binds to heparin and chondroitin sulphate (perin
et al. 1988). some interleukins show selective binding
with different classes of gag (ramsdem and rider
1982). fibroblasts produce several growth factors like
 xxxg787xxx  (ruoslahti and yamaguchi 1991), pdgf (heldin
et al. 1985), tgfo~ and tgf~3 (locci et al. 1993), some
interleukins (bodo et al. 1993) and epidermal growth
factor (carpenter and cohen 1985). these growth factors are multifunctional. one peptide can have both stimulatory and inhibitory activity upon the cells, depending

322
on the context of other growth factors present and the
composition of ecm. each factor influences ecm deposition and exerts its effect on the production and/or expression of the others (pierce et al. 1991-1992; goldsmith et al. 1991; nugent and edelman 1992; locci et
al. 1993; bodo et al. 1993). in our system the partial
suppression of stimulatory effect of tgf~i, incubated
with sulphated gag, upon gag synthesis in fibroblasts
can be ascribed to the interference of sulphated gag
with other growth factors and/or other ecm components.
in contrast to the sulphated gag, pre-incubation of
tgf[31 with high molecular weight ha considerably reduced its inhibitory effect upon thymocyte proliferation.
digestion of the tgf[~i-ha complex with hyase before
being added to thymocytes, restored the inhibitory capacity of the tgf~v in the tgf~i-ha complex, ha
protects the factor from enzymatic digestion, as shown
by experiments in which tgf[31-ha complex was first
digested with trypsin and subsequently with hyase. the
doubly digested complex released active tgf~i with anti-proliferative potential. tgf[31, once activated, is rapidly degraded (coffey etal. 1987), therefore interaction
of ha with tgf[31 may sequester the factor in the ecm,
protecting it from enzymatic digestion, from where it
may be reaccessed via the action of glycosidases. experiments in which untreated and hyase-treated cm, collected from 7-day-old embryonic fibroblasts, are assayed
upon thymocyte-proliferative response, confirm the hypothesis of the existence of the interaction between
tgf[3 and ha.
the importance of quantitative and qualitative alterations in gag expression in the ecm has been assessed
by a number of researchers during a variety of biological
processes (becchetti et al. 1984; goldstein et al. 1986;
yoneda et al. 1988 a, b; ruoslahti 1989) and it is clear
that modulation of gag synthesis and secretion plays a
key role during development and differentiation. it has
been well-documented that important aspects of tgf~
action are its ability to stimulate the synthesis and deposition of various extracellular matrix components, to increase the synthesis of protease inhibitors and to depress
the synthesis of ecm degrading proteases (roberts and
sporn 1990). in comparison with other secreted factors,
tgfi] is the most potent regulator of ecm formation
and cell-ecm interaction. streuli et al. (1993) showed
that the absence of ecm induces tgf[31 over-expression, while the presence of ecm components in a basement membrane down-regulates factor expression. most
cells have the capacity to express and secrete tgfi3
which binds to several ecm components (taipale etal.
1992). since the ecm contains tgf{], it may be assumed that it represents a reservoir from which tgf[~
can be retrieved and subsequently act upon the surrounding cells. several different proteoglycans, some secreted,
some retained in the pericellular matrix or in the plasma
membrane, are able to bind tgfi]. of these,  xxxg2273xxx 
and  xxxg612xxx  are best known. tgf~ binds to proteoglycans via its core protein (yamaguchi etal. 1990; andres
et al. 1992). gag chains are not required for binding of
tgf[31 and appear to have no effect on the affinity of be-

taglycan for tgfi3 v gag chains interact with other
ecm components and other growth factors such as
 xxxg787xxx  (andres et al. 1992). in the present work, we have
shown for the first time the existence of an interaction
between tgf[31 and ha.
in cultured fibroblastic ceils, tgfi]~ is secreted into
the medium in an inactive form associated with the pericellular matrix (taipale et al. 1992). the factor can be
activated by low and high ph, heat treatment, certain
glycosidases and the actions of some proteolytic enzymes like plasmin (lyons et al. 1988; miyazono and
heldin 1989). while tgf~ activation through temporary
acidification is complete, activation via plasmin is incomplete. it was postulated that a fraction of tgf~
might be in a form that is inaccessible to plasmin or that
there may be different types of tgfl3-binding macromolecules in the medium of cultured cells. the finding
that tgf~ can also be activated by certain glycosidases
(miyazono and heldin 1989) supports the hypothesis
that tgf~31 can bind the ecm also via gag molecules.
the most interesting finding of the present study is
the possibility that ha may be involved in modulating
tgf~i activity, the tgfj31-ha interaction might prevent the factor from binding to either of its receptors (i
and ii) which are directly involved in signal transduction. alternatively, binding to  xxxg2273xxx  might be prevented, an interaction which facilitates the binding of the
factor to its type ii receptor.
a well-defined and characteristic expression pattern
of tgfi31 during development has been defined by
means of in situ hybridation and isoform-specific immunochemistry (fitzpatrick e t a l . 1990; gatherer et al.
1990; millan et al. 1991; pelton et al. 1991; schmid et
al. 1991). tgf~3 synthesis is subject to developmental
regulation and is differentially localized in vivo. in the
light of our data different amounts of ha accumulation
in the extracellular pool during development could contribute to the regulation of tgf~i activity.
further studies are needed better to characterize the
effects of ha and sulphated gag on tgf~i activity and
to define this regulation at the molecular level.
