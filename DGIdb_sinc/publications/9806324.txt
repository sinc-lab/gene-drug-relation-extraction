1 pharmacological studies have suggested that a3 receptors are present on central neurons. recently
this adenosine receptor subtype has been identi®ed in the rat and its presence in the central nervous
system has been con®rmed.
2 in this study we investigated the eects of acute intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of n6-2-(4aminophenyl)-ethyladenosine (apnea), a non-selective  xxxg84xxx  agonist, on arterial blood
pressure (abp) and heart rate (hr), after treatment with 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (dpcpx),
a selective antagonist of a1 adenosine receptors.
3 anaesthetized rats, after dpcpx (12 mg71 kg i.c.v.), were treated with apnea (0.4 ± 4 mg kg71
i.c.v.) resulting in a transitory and dose-dependent decrease in arterial blood pressure without a change
in heart rate. apnea also induced hypotensive responses after i.c.v. pretreatment with  xxxd150xxx , at
a dose of 20 mg kg71. in contrast, pretreatment 48 h before, with 4 mg kg71 i.c.v. of pertussis toxin
reduced the hypotensive eect induced by apnea. administration of apnea at a higher dose
(20 mg kg71 i.c.v.), after dpcpx, induced a decrease in abp of 766+5.4 mmhg and after 3 min a
decrease in heart rate of 762+6.0 beats min71. transection of the spinal cord abolished this signi®cant
fall in abp, but not the decrease of hr.
4 these results suggest that a population of a3-receptors is present in the cns, whose activation
induces a decrease in blood pressure with no change of heart rate.

introduction

methods

recently, the  xxxg84xxx  subtype has been
identi®ed in the rat (meyerhof et al., 1991; zhou et al., 1992)
and its presence in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, striatum,
hippocampus and hypothalamus of sheep has been reported
(jacobson et al., 1993; linden et al., 1993). the  xxxg84xxx  has
been shown to couple with g-proteins (linden, 1994). some
®ndings suggested a role for this receptor in mediating
hypotension (carruthers & fozard, 1993; fozard & carruthers, 1993). although both a fall in systemic vascular
resistance and a decrease in cardiac output contribute to the
hypotension induced in the rat by activation of adenosine a3
receptors (hannon et al., 1995), the physiological role(s) of a3
receptors in cardiovascular function remains to be determined.
we reported an important participation of adenosine in the
central control of arterial blood pressure via the involvement
of adenosine a2 rather than a1 receptors (stella et al., 1993). in
view of this, we have evaluated the eect of acute
intracerebroventricular (third ventricle) injection of the nonselective a1/a3 agonist, n6-2-(4-aminophenyl) ethyladenosine
(apnea) (carruthers & fozard, 1993; fozard & carruthers,
1993; collis & hourani, 1993) on arterial blood pressure
(abp) and heart rate (hr).

male sprague-dawley rats (weighing 250 ± 270 g, morini spa,
reggio emilia, italy) were housed at constant temperature
(22+18c) and relative humidity (60%), under regular light/
dark schedule (light 0700 to 1900) with free access to food and
water. animal care was in compliance with italian laws on the
protection of animals used for experimental and other scienti®c
purposes (d.m. 116/92), as well as with e.c. regulations (o.i.
of e.c. 1358/118/12/1986).

procedure
forty-eight hours before experiments, under general anaesthesia (ketamine 120 mg kg71 ip), the animals were prepared
for direct intracerebroventricular (i.c.v. third ventricle)
administration and immediately after insertion of the i.c.v.
cannulas some groups received 4 mg kg71 i.c.v. of pertussis
toxin (ptx).
on the day of the experiment the rats, anaesthetized with
urethane (1.2 g kg71 intraperitoneally; narcosis maintained
with 300 mg kg71 intravenously whenever necessary), were
prepared for measurement of arterial blood pressure using
previously described methods (stella et al., 1995). rats were
randomized and received one of four doses (from 0.4 ±
20 mg kg71) of the non-selective a1/a3 agonist, n6-2-(4aminophenyl)ethyladenosine (apnea). in the experimental
groups rats were pretreated with the adenosine a1 and a2receptor antagonist,  xxxd150xxx  (aph; 20 mg kg71 i.c.v.),
the
a1
antagonist,
8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine

(dpcpx; 12 mg kg71 i.c.v.) or had been pretreated with
pertussis toxin (ptx), as above and the response to the four
doses of apnea was evaluated. finally, in another group we
tested the cardiovascular eects of an agonist of a1 adenosine
receptors, n6 cyclohexyladenosine (cha), alone and after
dpcpx.
complete transection of the spinal cord was performed at
the t5-t7 vertebral level.

drugs and solution/statistical analysis of results
dpcpx and apnea were initially dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (dmso) and diluted with phosphate buer; the
concentration of dmso was less than 2%. control animals
treated intracerebroventricularly with 0.2 m phosphate buer
or phosphate buer and dmso did not show any signi®cant
change in blood pressure and heart rate basal values. the
volume of injection of drug solution or solvent was 100 nl. the
following drugs were used: apnea, cha, aph, dpcpx
(research biochemicals incorporated ma, u.s.a.); ketamine
hcl (parke-davis spa, lainate-milan italy), urethane and
pertussis toxin (sigma chemical co. st. louis mo, u.s.a.).
the changes in the arterial blood pressure (abp) were
calculated as the peak decrease of abp (mmhg). the
statistical dierences between group means were performed
using anova variance analysis, followed by newman keuls
test for paired groups. dierences were considered to be
signi®cant at p50.05. all results are expressed as
means+standard error (s.e.m.).

a3-adenosine receptors and cns

administration of apnea at dose of 20 mg kg71 i.c.v.
(n=8) after dpcpx injection induced a 766+5.4 mmhg fall
in arterial blood pressure (figure 1) and after 3 min a
762+6.0 beats/min71 signi®cant (p50.05) decrease in heart
rate (figure 2). the time course of this eect showed that the
response began 2.5 min after i.c.v. administration with the
maximal decrease at 3 min. recovery to basal values occurred
between 25 ± 30 min.
transection of the spinal cord abolished the fall in abp, but
did not signi®cantly aect hr decrease (data not shown)
induced by apnea (20 mg kg71 i.c.v. n=5) after i.c.v.
injection of dpcpx.
the intravenous (i.v.) administration of cha, a selective
agonist at a1 adenosine receptors, at doses from 1 ± 5 mg kg71

results
apnea (0.4 ± 4 mg/kg; n=8) injected into the third ventricle
of anaesthetized normotensive rats, after dpcpx (12 mg71 kg
i.c.v.) injection in the same ventricle, produced a transitory and
dose-related decrease in arterial blood pressure (abp) (figure
1) without any signi®cant alteration in heart rate (figure 2).
the time course of this eect showed that the response began
7 ± 12 s after i.c.v. administration, peaked between 50 ± 80 s
and recovery to basal values occurred between 11 ± 30 min.
in the same way apnea induced hypotensive responses
after pretreatment i.c.v. 5 min) with the a1 and a2 antagonist,
 xxxd150xxx  (aph), at the dose of 20 mg kg71 (n=8) (figure
1). in contrast, the apnea-induced decrease in abp was
signi®cantly inhibited in rats treated, 48 h earlier with pertussis
toxin (4 mg kg71 i.c.v., n=8) (figure 1).

(n=5) induced a signi®cant reduction of blood pressure and
heart rate (table 1) and this eect was completely blocked by
pretreatment, 5 min before, with dpcpx (12 mg kg71 i.c.v.).
administration of aph and dpcpx alone did not cause a
signi®cant variation in abp and hr (aph: 72.3+0.6 mmhg
and 8+3.4 beats/min71); (dpcpx: 71.8+0.4 mmhg and

discussion
it has been reported that the intravenous administration of a
 xxxg84xxx  agonist produced a fall in blood pressure of
anaesthetized rats (carruthers & fozard, 1993) and that the
hypotensive response to the adenosine  xxxg84xxx  activation
in the rat is largely, if not exclusively, a consequence of
mediator release from mast cells (hannon et al., 1995; fozard
et al., 1996). our results show that i.c.v. injection (3rd
ventricle) of the  xxxg84xxx  agonist, apnea, induced a
decrease of arterial blood pressure without eects on heart rate
at doses from 0.4 ± 4 mg kg71.
to determine the role of a3 receptors in the central
cardiovascular response to apnea we investigated the eect
of  xxxd150xxx , a non-selective a1 and a2 antagonist,
dpcpx, a selective a1 antagonist, and pertussis toxin on
hypotensive responses to apnea. after pretreatment with
 xxxd150xxx , at a dose in excess of those required to block a1
and a2 receptors (stella et al., 1993), apnea induced
hypotension. in agreement with other studies, this con®rms
that in the rat, a3-receptors are insensitive (zhou et al., 1992)
or resistant (ramkumar et al., 1993) to xanthine antagonists.
even after dpcpx pretreatment, apnea induced a decrease
in blood pressure. in contrast, after pretreatment with
pertussis toxin (that does not discriminate between a1 and
a3 receptors), apnea induced a fall in abp signi®cantly
smaller than that observed after treatment with dpcpx7
apnea or aph+apnea, demonstrating an involvement of
gi/go-proteins. it has been reported, in rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells, that
 xxxg84xxx  activation stimulates inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate
production and accumulation of intracellular ca2+ (ramkumar et al., 1993). this response is also sensitive to pertussis
toxin, suggesting that is not a  xxxg923xxx -mediated response but may
be mediated by the bg-subunits of g-proteins (boyer et al.,
1994). taken together our results show that the hypotensive
eect induced by apnea was mainly due to the stimulation of
a3 adenosine receptors.
the conclusion that apnea-induced hypotension was due
to the stimulation of central a3 receptors is based on the
observations that: (a) i.c.v. injection of apnea induced a

a3-adenosine receptors and cns

more intense reduction of arterial blood pressure, than that
induced by higher doses administrated i.v. (carruthers &
fozard, 1993), (b) the latency of this hypotensive eect is very
short and (c) the spinal cord transection completely prevented
it. moreover it is interesting to note that, as it is widely
reported (phillis & wu, 1981; katims et al., 1983; barraco et
al., 1986, 1987, 1990, 1991; dunwiddie, 1985; marangos &
boulenger, 1985; biaggioni, 1992, stella et al., 1993, 1995), the
central administration of a1 adenosine receptor agonists
always produces bradycardia and decreases arterial blood
pressure. in our experiments i.c.v. apnea was able to induce
only a decrease of blood pressure in the presence of an a1
receptor antagonist. this further con®rms that a3 receptors,
which are activated by apnea together a1 receptors, are
exclusively involved in blood pressure control.
as regard to the relationship between a3 central receptors
and the regulation of heart rate, basing on our experimental
data, we exclude the involvement of a3 central receptors in
heart rate regulation. in fact, apnea, after dpcpx
pretreatment, induced bradycardia only with the highest dose
(20 mg kg71), whereas without dpcpx pretreatment even very
low doses (0.4 and 2 mg kg71) of apnea were able to
signi®cantly reduce heart rate, and a dose of 4 mg kg71 was
lethal for rats (data not shown). therefore i.c.v. apnea
injection causes bradycardic eects via central  xxxg81xxx 
stimulation and these eects are prevented by dpcpx
pretreatment. this indirectly con®rms that in our experimental
conditions central a3 receptors are not involved in the
regulation of heart rate. on the other hand the bradycardic
eect induced by 20 mg kg71 of apnea after dpcpx
pretreatment, was surely due to peripheral  xxxg84xxx 
stimulation because it appeared 3 min after injection and
spinal cord transection was unable to prevent it. it is sure that
the dose of dpcpx used is able to block a1 adenosine
receptors because the same i.c.v. dose of dpcpx, which did
not prevent apnea-induced cardiovascular eect, completely
prevented the hypotension and bradycardia elicited by
intravenous cha administration, a selective agonist at
adenosine a1 receptors.
in conclusion our data suggest that in the cns there is a
population of a3-receptors which when activated by an a3
receptor agonist induces only a decrease in blood pressure
without in¯uencing heart rate. moreover, only the activation
of peripheral a3 adenosine receptors may modulate heart rate.
