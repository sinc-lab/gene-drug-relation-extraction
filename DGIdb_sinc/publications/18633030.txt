synergy between pairs of competitive antagonists at
adult human muscle acetylcholine receptors
man liu, phd
james p. dilger, phd

background: synergistic neuromuscular blocking effects have been observed clinically with certain pairs of  xxxg456xxx  (nachr) competitive
antagonists. the mechanism for synergy has not been elucidated. we tested the
hypothesis that synergy arises from a differential selectivity of antagonists for the
two ligand binding sites on adult human nachr.
methods: we expressed nachr in bosc23 cells. we applied ach with or without
antagonists to outside-out patches and measured macroscopic currents at room
temperature. we determined the ic90 for (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx ,  xxxd2625xxx , pancuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, rocuronium, and atracurium. for 15 combinations of two antagonists, we determined the ic90 for one antagonist in the presence
of the ic70 of a second antagonist. we constructed isobolograms for 90% inhibition.
for single antagonists, we measured inhibition of receptors containing mutations in
the ⑀- and ␦-subunits to determine site selectivity.
results: two pairs of antagonists,  xxxd2625xxx ⫹cisatracurium and cisatracurium⫹
atracurium exhibited additive inhibition. ten combinations, including (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx ⫹
pancuronium and pancuronium⫹vecuronium, were highly synergistic such that the
combination was two to three times more effective than expected for additivity.
three combinations were 1.5–1.6 times more effective than expected for additivity.
inhibition by (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  and  xxxd2625xxx  was sensitive to mutations in the
⑀-subunit only. vecuronium was affected by the ␦-subunit mutation only. inhibition by other antagonists was decreased by mutations in either subunit.
conclusions: many combinations of antagonists exhibited synergistic effects on
adult human nachr. synergy was observed with structurally similar and dissimilar antagonists. the degree of synergy did not always correlate well with site
specificity assayed with mutants. in some, but not all cases, the synergy at the
receptor level correlated with clinical determinations of synergy. we conclude that
the synergistic actions of muscle relaxants can be partially explained by direct
interactions with adult human nachr.

he clinical use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants
to produce paralysis during surgery began in 1942
with (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx , a benzylisoquinoline extracted
from a south american vine.1 in 1964, pancuronium, a
derivative of a steroid toxin found in an african plant,
was introduced. the common structural feature of
these drugs, one [(⫹)- xxxd3456xxx ] or two (pancuronium) quaternary ammonium groups, confers high
affinity binding to the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor (nachr). the drugs are competitive antagonists of the nachr.

in the 1980s, certain combinations of nondepolarizing competitive muscle relaxants were observed to
have super-additive, or synergistic, neuromuscular
blocking effects.2–5 the classic example is the combination of (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  and pancuronium. a 95%
depression of a single twitch (ed95) required either
0.51 mg/kg of (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  or 0.07 mg/kg of
pancuronium.2 however, when the two drugs were
combined, ed95 was achieved with ⬍1/3 the dose of
each drug.2 synergy has been observed for other
combinations often, but not exclusively, with one
benzylisoquinoline and one aminosteroid. combinations of muscle relaxants have been also examined in
animal studies of neuromuscular junction6 – 8 and
isolated muscle preparations.9 with one exception,8
synergy was observed with (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  or  xxxd2625xxx  and pancuronium.
the nachr has two, non-identical binding sites for
acetylcholine (ach) located at the interface between
the ␣- and ␦-subunits and the interface between the ␣and ⑀-subunits (fig. 1). ach itself has a sixfold preference for the ␣-⑀ interface at the adult human
nachr.10 (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  and  xxxd2625xxx  also favor
525

figure 1. the hypothesis for the origin of synergy between (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  and pancuronium. there are two distinct binding
sites for acetylcholine (ach) and competitive antagonists of the muscle nicotinic ach receptor. ach must bind to both sites
before the channel can open efficiently. (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  has a higher affinity for the binding site at the ␣⑀ interface than at
the ␣␦ interface. the hypothesis is that pancuronium has a higher affinity for the binding site at the ␣␦ interface. in this case,
the two antagonists would bind nearly independently and inhibition would be synergistic.

the ␣-⑀ interface but by factors of 15 and 80 respectively.11 in embryonic nachr in which the ⑀-subunit
is replaced by a ␥-subunit, (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  and  xxxd2625xxx  favor the ␣-␥ interface. interestingly, distinct
amino acid residues confer high selectivity to the ⑀ and
␥-subunits.12,13 a 26-fold site selectivity has been seen
for pancuronium in adult mouse nachr14 and there is
evidence that the ␣-␦ interface has the higher affinity.15
the hypothesis that synergy arises from selective
binding of (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  and pancuronium to opposite interfaces (fig. 1), originally proposed by waud
and waud in 1985,9 was tested in vitro by paul et al.16
they expressed the subunits of adult mouse nachr in
oocytes and measured the inhibition of ach-induced
currents by pairs of muscle relaxants. they found no
evidence for synergy and concluded that synergy
must arise from some other process, perhaps involving presynaptic nachrs. these experiments, however, were performed under conditions of relatively
low receptor occupancy. when receptor occupancy is
low, it can be difficult to distinguish between competition and synergy.9,17
there is another reason to use conditions of high
receptor occupancy when looking for in vitro evidence
of synergy. nature has provided fast-twitch skeletal
muscle with a high margin of safety.18 the origin of
the safety margin is a combination of a bountiful
release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic
nerve terminal, a copious density of receptors on the
postsynaptic membrane and a generous supply of
action-potential-triggering sodium channels at the muscle
endplate.19,20 in cat tibialis and sartorium muscles, a
receptor occupancy of 0.76 ⫾ 0.05 is needed before any
diminution of muscle contraction is detected and the
receptor occupancy required for complete block is
0.917 ⫾ 0.16.18 the margin of safety for the diaphragm
muscle may be even higher.21 although it is sometimes argued that the margin of safety is lower in
human muscle compared with other mammals, neuromuscular transmission in normal humans rarely
fails.20,22

synergy between pairs of muscle relaxants

here, we use patch clamp recording to test for in
vitro evidence of synergy between pairs of muscle
relaxants on adult human nachr. specifically, we
consider high levels of receptor occupancy to determine
the ic90 of individual drugs and drug combinations.
these conditions should be comparable to in vivo determinations of ce50 values for muscle relaxation.

methods
human adult muscle nachrs were expressed in
bosc23 cells, a subclone of human embryonic kidney
293 (hek-293) cells (american type culture collection, manassas, va), using a lipid-based reagent (fugene 6, roche diagnostics, basel, switzerland). cells
were transfected with cdna coding for subunits of
human nachr23: ␣, ␤, ⑀, and ␦ (gift of dr. steven
sine). cdna for cd8 (gift of dr. brian seed), a t-cell
antigen used as a marker24 was co-transfected. the
achr cdna was cloned into the prbg4 expression
vector; the cd8 cdna was cloned into the ␲h3-cd8
expression plasmid. the mutations ⑀d59a, ⑀d173a,
and ␦d180k were prepared from wild-type ⑀- or
␦-subunit by bridging with a 20-base pair oligonucleotide. dna sequencing confirmed the constructs. experiments were performed on cells in 2–3 days after
transfection. cells were prepared for patch-clamp
recording as described before.25,26 an extracellular
solution (ecs) contains 150 mm nacl, 5.6 mm kcl,
1.8 mm cacl2, 1.0 mm mgcl2, and 10 mm hepes, ph
7.3. in order to identify transfected cells, 2–3 ␮l of
polystyrene beads coated with a monoclonal antibody
specific for the cd8 antigen (dynabeads; invitrogen
corporation, carlsbad, ca) were added in the cell
dish. cells with two or more beads attached were
considered likely to express nachr and cd8.24
nacl, kcl, and cacl2 were obtained from
mallinckrodt baker, inc. (phillipsburg, nj); mgcl2 was
obtained from fisher scientific (fairlawn, nj); hepes,
egta, acetylcholine chloride (purity ⬎99%), (⫹) xxxd3456xxx  chloride (purity 98%), pancuronium dibromide (purity ⬎99%) and  xxxd245xxx  were

obtained from sigma-aldrich corp. (st. louis, mo).
 xxxd2626xxx  was synthesized27 from (⫹) xxxd3456xxx  at the chemical synthesis center,
department of chemistry, stony brook university.
purity of 99% was determined by 1h-nmr. vecuronium bromide was obtained as the clinical formulation norcuron® from bedford labs (bedford, oh), 1
mg/ml (1.8 mm) in a solution containing 2.1 mg/ml
 xxxd1710xxx , 1.6 mg/ml sodium phosphate
and 9.7 mg/ml mannitol. dilutions were prepared in
distilled water. the highest concentration of vecuronium
used, 1 ␮m, contained 95 ␮m mannitol. rocuronium
bromide was obtained as the clinical formulation
zemuron® from baxter pharmaceutical solutions llc
(deerfield, il), 1 mg/ml (16.4 mm). cisatracurium
besylate was obtained as the clinical formulation nimbex® from glaxosmithkline (philadelphia, pa), 2
mg/ml (2.1 mm) in a 35% benzene sulfonic acid
solution. dilutions were prepared in distilled water.
the highest concentration of cisatracurium used, 1
␮m, contained 0.017% benzene sulfonic acid.
patch pipettes filled with a solution consisting of
140 mm kcl, 5 mm egta, 5 mm mgcl2, and 10 mm
hepes, ph 7.3, had resistances of 2 to 7 m⍀. an
outside-out patch28 with a seal resistance of ⱖ2 g⍀
was excised from a cell and moved into position at the
outflow of a hsse-2 rapid perfusion system (ala
scientific instruments, westbury, ny). the gravitycontrolled perfusion system consists of solution reservoirs, manual switching valves, a solenoid-driven
pinch valve, and two teflon tubes inserted into the culture
dish.29 one tube contained ecs or (ecs⫹antagonist); the
other contained (ecs⫹ach) or (ecs⫹ach⫹antagonist).
a saturating concentration of 300 ␮m ach was used
to activate currents in wild-type, ⑀d59a and ⑀d173a
nachr. activation of ␦d180k nachr required 1.5
mm ach for maximal currents. manual valves were
used to connect to reservoirs containing a defined
concentration of competitive antagonist with or without ach. the system allows a rapid (0.1–1 ms) exchange of the solution bathing the excised patch.29 the
patch was clamped at ⫺50 mv while a series of 10 –20,
250 ms applications of ach-containing solution was
applied at a 5-s interval. currents were digitized at 100
␮s per point and high-pass filtered at 3 khz with a
patch clamp amplifier (epc-9, heka instruments, inc.,
port washington, ny).
in experiments with a single antagonist, control
currents and recovery currents were obtained with
antagonist-free solutions, test currents were obtained
with antagonist-containing solutions. in experiments
with pairs of antagonists, the control and recovery
currents were obtained in the presence of 2 ⫻ ic50 of
antagonist1 and test currents were obtained in the
presence of 2 ⫻ ic50 of antagonist1 ⫹ different concentration of antagonist2. an experiment was accepted
if the recovery currents were at least 80% of the control
currents. at least six concentration points were used
for every antagonist; at least one of these produced

⬎90% inhibition. relative currents were calculated as
the ratio of the test current, i1, to the average of the
control and recovery currents, i0. the hill equation
was used to determine the ic50, the concentration
needed to produce a 50% inhibition of the current and
the hill coefficient, nh.

in figure 3d. we then measured a concentrationresponse curve for (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  in the presence of
15 nm pancuronium, the concentration equal to 2 ⫻ ic50
of pancuronium (fig. 3c). thus, the low (⫹) xxxd3456xxx  concentration asymptote for the curve in
figure 3c is 0.33. the ic90 for (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  in the
presence of 15 nm pancuronium is 63 nm. the point (15
nm, 63 nm) is plotted on the isobologram (fig. 3d). as
can be seen from figure 3d, the combination of
(⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  and pancuronium are highly synergistic for blocking 90% of achr currents. the fractional ic90 doses are 0.22 and 0.16 for (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx 
and pancuronium respectively, giving a total fraction
dose of 0.38 (0.25, 0.53) (95% ci). for comparison, the
fractional dose for these antagonists on patients is
0.63.2
an alternate way to present data from two antagonists is to consider the apparent ic50 of antagonist2 in
the presence of antagonist1. in figure 4a, we normalized
the concentration-response curve of (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  ⫹
15 nm pancuronium to that of (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  alone. the
ic50 values of the two curves are essentially the same, 25
nm. this suggests that the two antagonists bind to the
achr independently rather than compete for the same
site. in contrast, figure 4b shows a similar comparison
for  xxxd2625xxx  and cisatracurium. the ic50 of  xxxd2625xxx  alone is 18 nm. the apparent ic50 of  xxxd2625xxx 
in the presence of 20 nm cisatracurium is shifted to 59
nm. this shift to a lower potency is consistent with
competition.

(note right-hand axes). there is no shift in the apparent ic50 of (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  when 15 nm pancuronium is present; this
suggests that the antagonists bind independently. there is a three-fold shift in the apparent ic50 of cisatracurium when 40 nm
 xxxd2625xxx  is present; this suggests that the antagonists compete for the same binding sites.

for three pairs of antagonists, we experimentally
determined additional points on the isobolograms
(fig. 5). we varied the parameters in equation 2 to
obtain an isobologram with r ⫽ 0.1 using equation 2
(dashed line) that intersected the initial experimental
point (solid square). we then chose several additional
concentration pairs that lie on the isobologram (open
squares). the inhibition produced by these additional
concentration pairs was determined on four to six
patches. in all cases, the ratios of resulting currents
compared to antagonist-free controls were not significantly different from 0.1 (fig. 5 insets). figure 5a shows
the results for vecuronium⫹pancuronium. they exhibited
strong synergy over the entire isobologram. the combination of (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx ⫹cisatracurium (fig. 5b) exhibited

weaker but significant synergy. the combination of

the results for all pairs of antagonists are summarized in table 2. the total fractional doses are significantly

all combinations except  xxxd2625xxx ⫹cisatracurium

have been previously identified to alter the binding
affinity for  xxxd2625xxx  and/or (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx .11 we
also examined a mutation, ␦d180k, which decreases
binding of both ach and (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  to the
␦-subunit in mouse nachr.34 we found that it also
decreased the sensitivity of adult human nachr to
ach. the current response saturated with application
of 1.5 mm ach without causing appreciable open
channel block at ⫺50 mv (not shown). thus, experiments with ␣2␤⑀␦(d180k) were performed with 1.5
mm ach instead of the 0.3 mm used in all other
experiments.
if a mutation in  xxxg220xxx  changes the affinity for a
drug, this suggests that the drug has significant interactions with that subunit interface. if there is no
change in affinity, the result is inconclusive. figure 6
summarizes the results. in all cases, the mutations
either reduced the affinity of the receptor for the drugs
(less inhibition at a fixed concentration) or caused no

change. as expected from previously published data,
(⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  and  xxxd2625xxx  are sensitive to mutations in the ⑀-subunit but not in the ␦-subunit.
vecuronium is insensitive to the two ⑀-subunit mutations
but is sensitive to the ␦-subunit mutation. inhibition
by the other antagonists is sensitive to mutations in
either subunit.

discussion
synergism between pairs of muscle relaxant drugs
has been observed in vivo with human adductor
pollicis muscle using either single twitch or train-offour ratio to assay muscle function.2–5,35–37 it has also
been investigated in animals: rat phrenic nervehemidiaphragm,6 guinea pig nerve- xxxd2960xxx  muscle,7
isolated guinea pig  xxxd2960xxx  muscle9 and rat sciatic
nerve-tibialis muscle.8 the fact that synergy was reported in most of these preparations (with the exception of reference8) suggests that pharmacokinetic
effects are not important. (however, pharmacokinetics
may play a role in the interaction between  xxxd2658xxx  and
pancuronium due to hydrolysis of  xxxd2658xxx  by
butyrylcholinesterase38). synergy was investigated at
the receptor level using adult mouse nachr expressed in oocytes.16 these investigators found no
evidence for synergy in their study.
most of the clinical results are consistent with each
other. additive block was mainly observed with antagonists of similar structures, whereas super-additive
block was observed with different structural classes of
antagonists (reviewed in39). combinations of benzylisoquinoliniums, such as (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx ⫹ xxxd2625xxx  and
cisatracurium⫹atracurium are additive.2,35 the combination of two aminosteroids, pancuronium, and vecuronium,
are also additive.3 synergy was seen for pairs of antagonists
with different structures, e.g.,  xxxd2625xxx  and pancuronium,2 (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  and pancuronium2 and cisatracurium and vecuronium or rocuronium.35
we studied human adult muscle nachrs expressed in bosc23 cells and found evidence for
synergy between many pairs of both similar and
dissimilar antagonists. this differs from a previous
study of expressed receptors in which no combinations of antagonists exhibited synergy.16 the methods
used in the two studies differ in several respects. we
used human instead of mouse achr, we used
outside-out patches from a mammalian expression cell
line instead of frog oocytes and we examined ic90
levels of antagonist concentrations instead of ic50
levels. all of these factors probably contribute to the
different conclusions of the studies. first, the other
investigators examined whether the combination of
the ic25 of drug a plus the ic25 of drug b was
equipotent to the ic50 of a single drug. if the drugs
acted competitively, this combination would produce
a current 0.50 times the antagonist-free control. if the
drugs acted independently, ic25a ⫹ ic25b would
produce a current 0.44 times the antagonist-free control (equation 2). these predictions differ by 12%. in

where x ⫽ 50, 75, 90 or 95. at low receptor occupancy,
ⱕic50, the difference between synergy and additivity is
small and may be difficult to determine experimentally. the
differences are more pronounced at higher occupancy levels.
contrast, a comparison of the ic45 of the drug combination with the ic90 of a single drug, yields predictions of 0.033 versus 0.099. this threefold difference in
predictions is considerably easier to detect. figure 7
presents isobolograms derived from equation 2 for
different levels of receptor occupancy. others have
also discussed this concept.9,17 second, we have noted
differences in the effects of antagonists between human and mouse achr. for example, we found that
combinations of pancuronium or vecuronium with
(⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  were not synergistic on mouse
ahcr (unpublished results). third, the use of outsideout patches provides ms time resolution to better
determine the action of drugs that associate and
dissociate on this time scale.25,26 most importantly,
muscle relaxation occurs only when there is a high
occupancy of receptors by antagonists.20 a drawback
to using such high levels of inhibition in electrophysiology experiments is that the receptor concentrationresponse curve is relatively flat in this range and this
leads to large uncertainties in ic90 values. in contrast,
these concentrations are within the steep part of the in
vivo curves because of the high margin of safety.
we examined nine combinations of antagonists
that can be compared to published clinical data
(table 2). of these, five show qualitative agreement
in that the fractional analysis values are significantly ⬍1.0 [(⫹)- xxxd3456xxx /pancuronium, (⫹) xxxd3456xxx /vecuronium, vecuronium/cisatracurium,
cisatracurium/rocuronium] or essentially equal to 1.0
(atracurium/cisatracurium). thus, for these five, dissimilar
antagonists are synergistic and similar drugs are additive.
the remaining four combinations involve structurally
similar drugs that are additive in human studies but
synergistic in our experiments. one possible explanation is that there are important differences in nachr

behavior between our in vitro preparation and in vivo
conditions. certainly, an outside-out patch of non-muscle
membrane containing heterologously expressed receptors provides only a minimalist approximation of
the physiological environment of nachr at the neuromuscular junction. however, the data in table 1
indicate that there is a very good correlation between
the in vivo ce50 and in vitro ic90 values for antagonists.
(the ic50 values determined by us are similar to those
reported by jonsson et al.40 for adult human nachr
expressed in oocytes.) one difference between the two
conditions is temperature. we have found that increasing temperature from 25°c to 37°c decreases the
affinity of embryonic mouse muscle nachr for antagonists by a factor of 1.7 to 1.9, but increases the association and dissociation rates by two to fivefold and
this is antagonist-dependent.41 the effect of temperature on synergy is unknown. alternatively, the muscle
nachr may not be the only molecular actor that
participates in muscle relaxant synergy. in addition,
there are neuronal nachrs42 and purinergic receptors43,44 that may modulate activity at the neuromuscular junction.
a commonly invoked explanation for muscle relaxant synergy involves the role of presynaptic neuronal
nachrs.16 these receptors are thought to provide a
positive feedback mechanism for vesicular ach release by prolonging nerve terminal depolarization and
increasing intracellular calcium.42 (however, there is
also evidence for a presynaptic negative feedback
mechanism45). in this explanation, synergy results if
one antagonist acts primarily on the postsynaptic
nachr and the other acts on the presynaptic nachr.
there are several lines of evidence that argue against
such a scenario. (a) the correlation between clinical
and experimental concentrations of antagonists (table
1) suggests that all of the muscle relaxants produce a
similar inhibition of muscle nachrs at clinical concentrations. (b) muscle relaxants are much less potent
on human neuronal nachr subtypes (including ␣3␤2,
the subtype found on mouse motor neurons46) than
they are on human muscle nachr.40 based on these
data, the calculated inhibition of ␣3␤2 nachr at in vivo
ce50 concentrations is 3% (pancuronium), 5% (cisatracurium), 7% (vecuronium), 12% [(⫹)- xxxd3456xxx ] and
22% (rocuronium). because the inhibition of muscle
nachr is already ⱖ90% at ce50 concentrations (table
1), it is not clear how inhibition of presynaptic receptors
could make a substantial contribution. (c) inhibition of
the presynaptic feedback mechanism might possibly
produce the phenomenon of fade during repetitive
stimuli,42 but it is unlikely to affect the twitch response to
a single stimulus.
experiments with nachr mutants must be interpreted carefully. the lack of an effect by a mutation
does not eliminate that site or subunit as a possible
antagonist binding site. the presence of an effect by a
mutation is good, but not conclusive, evidence that the
site is important for binding. there is always the
532

synergy between pairs of muscle relaxants

possibility of large-scale structural rearrangement of
the protein due the mutation. in our experiments, all
of the functional mutations decreased inhibition by
antagonists; thus, the mutations did not create new
binding sites, but decreased affinity for existing sites.
however, the data obtained with mutant receptors
(fig. 6) do not completely clarify the molecular origins
of antagonist synergy. for example, we found the
combination of (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  and pancuronium to
be highly synergistic. the isobologram in figure 3d
assumes that the two antagonists are highly selective
(ⱖ100:1) for opposite binding sites. the mutation data
suggest, though, that pancuronium has a significant
affinity for both sites. similarly, vecuronium and
pancuronium show a high degree of synergy (fig. 5a)
and yet both are affected by a mutation on the
␦-subunit. and, most surprisingly, (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx 
and  xxxd2625xxx , which both have high affinity for the
␣-⑀ interface, show synergistic effects in our experiments. one possible explanation is that antagonist
binding to one site is accompanied by a conformational change in the nachr that affects the affinity of
the other site. there is evidence to suggest that this
may be the case.26,41
in summary, we found that several combinations of
competitive antagonists for human adult muscle
achr show evidence for synergy when tested at high
receptor occupancy. the negative results reported in a
previous attempt to measure synergy in vitro16 may
have arisen from the use of lower concentrations of
antagonists. our findings, however, could not be
interpreted in terms of a scheme in which antagonists
had preferential binding for one of the two ligand
binding sites on the nachr (fig. 1). we suggest that
conformational changes induced by antagonist binding may contribute to synergistic effects. some of our
findings correlate with clinical measures of synergy in
humans, but others do not. we suggest that temperature differences may be important. alternatively, proteins found at the neuromuscular junction, but not
included in our outside-out patches, may play a role.
