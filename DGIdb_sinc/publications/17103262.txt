background: it is unclear whether hormone replacement therapy (hrt), in addition to
increasing risk for breast cancer, affects the type of breast cancer diagnosed. we conducted
this investigation to assess whether the type of hormone used (none, estrogen, progesterone, or
combined) and duration of use inﬂuences subsequent breast cancer histology.
methods: we performed a retrospective cohort analysis among women listed as incident
cases of breast malignancy in the kaiser permanente northern california cancer registry
during 2003 (n = 2830). type and duration of hormone used (none, estrogen, progesterone,
or combined) before breast cancer diagnosis was obtained from electronic pharmacy records.
the association between type and duration of hormone use with characteristics of subsequent
breast cancers was examined.
results: among women aged >50 years (n = 1701), any use of estrogen, progesterone, or
combination therapy was not associated with an increased risk of  xxxg730xxx  (er)positive disease. however, >6 monthsõ use of combined hrt increased the odds of erpositive tumors (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% conﬁdence interval, 1.07–2.5; p = .02). estrogen hrt
patients were more likely than nonusers to present with low-grade (p = .05), and early-stage
tumors (p = .03). this trend was not seen in combined hrt users.
conclusions: short-duration hrt did not increase the likelihood of er-positive breast
cancer. however, prolonged duration of combined hrt, but not estrogen or progesterone
alone, resulted in a marked increase in er-positive disease. our ﬁndings suggest that the effect
of combined hrt on breast cancer incidence or progression is not immediate and that longterm use is more likely to affect breast cancer histology.
key words: breast cancer—hormone replacement therapy— xxxg730xxx .

although in vitro studies, in vivo animal studies,
and epidemiologic data support the essential role of

estrogens in breast cancer etiology, the role of exogenous hormone use in promoting breast carcinogenesis remains unclear. prospective randomized studies
show that exogenous estrogen alone does not increase
breast cancer risk, whereas the use of combined
estrogen and progesterone seems to greatly increase
this risk.1–3 however, it is controversial whether

inﬂuences the histological type (e.g., lobular vs. ductal) or  xxxg1603xxx  status ( xxxg730xxx ,
er;  xxxg1737xxx , pr) of newly diagnosed
breast cancers, and if there are different associations
between single-agent hrt (estrogen hrt or progesterone hrt) and combined estrogen-progesterone
hrt (combined hrt).
some studies indicate that patients with breast
cancer who had used exogenous hormone before their
diagnosis have smaller, lower-grade primary tumors
than those who had not.4,5 this difference is speculated
to relate to the  xxxg1603xxx  status of these cancers. there are well-established clinical and pathologic
distinctions between receptor-positive (er-positive
and/or pr-positive) breast cancers and receptor-negative breast cancers, yet these phenotypically different
breast cancer types are not clearly associated with
distinct epidemiological risk factor proﬁles.6,7
several studies have examined the relationship
between exogenous hormone use and breast cancer
 xxxg1603xxx  status (table 1); and although
most published case-control and cohort studies fail to
show a relationship between either hrt or combined
hrt and the selective development of receptor-positive breast cancer, three studies do report a marked
relationship between use of hrt and development of
receptor-positive breast cancer.8–10
in contrast, the womenõs health initiative (whi)
randomized trial showed that invasive breast cancers associated with estrogen plus progestin use were
larger, more likely to be node positive, and were
diagnosed at a far more advanced stage.11 although
the number of incident cancers studied was small
(n = 430), the whi study found no difference between tumor grade, histologic type (ductal vs. lobular) or receptor status (er and pr) between hrt
and placebo groups.
to investigate the factors resulting in these discrepant analyses, we conducted a detailed retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with incident
breast cancer at a large health maintenance organization that provided direct links to pharmacy and
centralized pathology data. we hypothesized that the
type of hormone used—estrogen, progesterone, or
combined—and duration of use does infact inﬂuence
estrogen and  xxxg1737xxx  status, degree of
er staining, tumor grade, and stage at diagnosis.

materials and methods
after institutional review board approval was
obtained, the kaiser permanente of northern
ann. surg. oncol. vol. 14, no. 2, 2007

california (kpnc) cancer registry provided the
investigators with a consecutive list of women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ and primary
breast cancer from january 1, 2003, to december 31,
2003, for whom er and pr receptor status was
known. because our goal was to capture pharmacy
data for a minimum of 18 months on this patient
cohort, those patients who joined kpnc after june
2001 were excluded. the electronic chart was reviewed for each of the included subjects (n = 2126).
hrt use
we recorded the type of prescribed hrt from
electronic pharmacy logs. because single formulations of combination estrogen and progesterone (i.e.,
prempro— xxxd2044xxx  plus  xxxd2554xxx ) are not carried in the kpnc formulary, patients classiﬁed as taking combination
regimens were simultaneously prescribed separate,
single preparations of estrogen and progesterone. we
further deﬁned combination therapy hrt patients as
those whose estrogen tablet total and progesterone
tablet total diﬀered by £100 tablets.
all hrt tablets were prescribed for one tablet to
be taken each day; therefore, duration and compliance were reﬂected in the number of pills dispensed.
from these data, we generated a duration index by
categorizing the number of tablets dispensed into
four groups: (1) never—when no tablets were dispensed; (2) <6 months—when tablet count was
<182.5; (3) 6 months to 5 years—when tablet count
was from 182.5 to 1825, and (4) >5 years—when
tablet count was 1826 or more. to conﬁrm hrt use
before breast cancer diagnosis, we correlated earliest
prescription dates with pathology specimen dates.
because the electronic pharmacy record only lists
prescriptions ﬁlled, and because patients in the
kpnc system rarely obtain prescription medications
outside of the kpnc system, we considered prescriptions that were consistently reﬁlled over time to
be a marker of compliance.
tumor type
the ratio of cells staining positive for estrogen
and progesterone receptors versus those unstained
(represented by a percentage of positivity) was
documented by kpnc pathologists in the data
registry. the kaiser permanente regional immunohistochemistry laboratory developed this immunoperoxidase panel, and the permanente medical
group, inc., northern california, determined its

performance characteristics. according to the
estrogen and progesterone immunohistochemical
receptor analysis used in this system, tumors with
<5% nuclear staining were considered negative for
the respective antibody. although ﬁnal determination is dependent on the subjective measurement by
the pathologist, all tumor specimens from kpnc
are read, and often double-read, by a team of ﬁve

pathologists at a single pathology laboratory (kaiser
san francisco).
tumor grade was determined by the pathologist on
the basis of histologic features and was coded in the
kpnc cancer registry as the highest grade present:
i (low grade), ii (moderate grade), and iii (high
grade). tumor stage in the kpnc cancer registry is

potential confounders
age stratiﬁcation was used to assign menopausal
categories on the basis of national averages and
previously published reports: premenopausal (<50
years old) and postmenopausal ( ‡ 50 years old).
within the kpnc registry, data were not available
for family history, body mass index, smoking, alcohol
use, or other comorbidities. previous studies have
established that older age is a statistically signiﬁcant
predictor of er-positive tumors; therefore, all odds
ratios (ors) generated were adjusted for age, with
age treated as a continuous variable.
statistical analyses
summary statistics for continuous variables
include mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and maximum values; categorical variables are
presented as counts and percentages. standard baseline characteristics are summarized for each group.
for continuous variables, means were compared by
analysis of variance. logistic regression was used to
estimate the eﬀects of predictor variables (age and
exogenous hormone use) on dichotomous outcome
variables (estrogen and  xxxg1737xxx  status).
we used linear regression to analyze percentage of
er staining by estrogen duration. categorical outcome variables were compared by the v2 test for
contingency tables; signiﬁcance was set at p < .05.
stata version 9 (college station, tx) was used to
perform all analyses and to prepare all tables and
ﬁgures.

results
patient age at the time of primary breast tumor
diagnosis ranged from 15.3 to 95.7 years
(mean ± sd, 61.8 ± 12.9 years). there was a neareven distribution of those receiving any hrt versus
those not (1128 vs. 998). as expected, women
receiving any hrt were signiﬁcantly older than those
not receiving hrt (63.9 vs. 59.9 years; p < .0001);
only 56 women <50 were receiving hrt, whereas
942 women aged ‡50 were receiving hrt. among
the 942 patients with breast cancer ‡50 years of age
receiving any hrt, 16.6% were prescribed estrogen

only, 2.2% were prescribed progesterone only, and
36.6% were prescribed any combination of estrogen
and progesterone (any estrogen hrt and any progesterone hrt). median duration of estrogen and
progesterone use was 2.2 and 1.5 years, respectively.
although 622 women (66%) aged ‡ 50 who were
prescribed hrt received some combination of
estrogen and progesterone, only 302 women (33%)
received combined hrt, deﬁned as comparable use
of both estrogen and progesterone (within 100 tablets) (fig. 1).
breast tumor receptor status
as expected, older patient age was signiﬁcantly
associated with er-positive breast cancers (p <
.001), with the odds of developing an er-positive
tumor increasing by 2% per year (or, 1.02; 95%
conﬁdence interval [ci], 1.01–1.04). the odds of
developing a pr-positive tumor increased by 5% per
year (p = .01) for patients between ages 15 and 50
years, and only increased by 1.3% per year for patients ‡50 years (p = .008), but when these age
groups were not dichotomized, the relationship between pr-positive breast cancer and patient age was
not statistically signiﬁcant (p = .18).
relative to the reference set of patients who never
took hrt (or, 1.0), those with previous use of any
hrt had no marked association with tumor er or
pr status when duration of use was not accounted
for (tables 2 and 3). only 38 women aged ‡ 50 had
progesterone exposure alone; however, they had a
decreased risk of developing pr-positive tumors.

a small group of women had brief (<6 months)
exposure to any hrt. these women had a reduced
risk developing an er-positive tumor (or, .6,
p = .02 for any estrogen hrt; or, .5, p = .02 for
combined hrt) or a pr-positive tumor (or, .5, p
< .01 for any estrogen hrt; or, .6, p < .01 for any
progesterone hrt; or, .4, p = .01 for combined
hrt) (table 4). although sustained use of either any
estrogen hrt or any progesterone hrt had no
marked effect on tumor er and pr status, women
exposed to combined hrt for ‡6 months had a
higher risk of developing receptor-positive tumors
than nonusers (or, 1.6, p < .05).

because a threshold value of er-positive tumor
nuclei (>5% immunoreactive nuclei) deﬁned erpositive tumor status, the potential inﬂuence of hrt
on the percentage of er immunoreactive tumor nuclei was also evaluated among er-positive subjects.
figure 2a shows that duration of any estrogen hrt
did not signiﬁcantly affect the percentage of er-positive tumor nuclei within the er-positive tumors of
patients ‡ 50 years of age. moreover, although prolonged combined hrt use had been shown to increase the odds of developing an er-positive cancer,
it did not affect the percentage of staining among
these tumors (fig. 2b).

when compared with women who did not receive
any hrt, those who were prescribed any estrogen
hrt were more likely to present with earlier-stage
tumors, particularly locally invasive cancers, as opposed to regionally invasive cancers or cancers that
had metastasized distantly at presentation (p = .03)
fig. 4). when duration of exposure to any estrogen
hrt was investigated, brief exposure (<6 months)
resulted in a higher proportion of early-stage tumors,
whereas sustained exposure led to increasing proportions of later-stage tumors (p = .02). for combined hrt, the distribution of proportions seems
similar; however, the differences are not statistically
signiﬁcant.

breast tumor histology, grade, and stage
we found a strong association between lobular
(including mixed lobular and ductal) tumor histology
and er positivity (97% of lobular tumors were er
positive, p < .001). however, no statistically significant associations were observed between lobular
histology and hrt, including combined hrt, even
when associations were adjusted for age.
tumor grade was recorded in 1482 patients aged
‡50 for whom er and pr status was known.
increasing grade was signiﬁcantly associated with
decreased odds of er-positive tumors (or, .16, p <
.001) and pr-positive tumors (or, .36, p < .001).
among women ‡50 years old, those prescribed any
estrogen hrt were more likely to present with lowgrade tumors than women who were not (fig. 3).
increasing duration of any progesterone use was
signiﬁcantly associated with higher proportions of
low- and intermediate-grade tumors (p = .004).

breast cancer risk associated with hrt is a matter
of continued discussion and debate. as is true for
other complex associations, unraveling the relationship between hrt and breast cancer incidence has
proven diﬃcult and is complicated by diﬀerent study
designs, widely divergent durations of therapy, and
varied therapy regimens. the two largest published
randomized, controlled trials comparing combined
hrt to placebo, the whi and the heart and
estrogen/progestin replacement study (hers),
have yielded conﬂicting results.11,12 the hazard ratios
for breast cancer were 1.24 (95% ci, 1.02–1.50) at a
mean follow-up time of 5.2 years in the whi, and
1.27 (95% ci, .84–1.94) after 6.8 years in hers.
a systematic review of 52,705 women with breast
cancer showed a relative risk of 1.35 (95% ci, 1.21–
1.49) for women who received hrt for more than 5
years.13 however, this ﬁnding was difﬁcult to interpret given the wide range of regimens and durations
of therapy included in the analysis. nevertheless,
these studies, taken together, suggest increased odds
of breast cancer with combined hrt when compared
with placebo.
the biological eﬀect of hrt on breast cancer
histology, especially receptor status, has proven even
more diﬃcult to establish than the relationship between hrt and breast cancer incidence. several
studies have shown increased incidence of er-positive tumors with hrt, particularly with combined
estrogen and progesterone preparations.8–10,14
however, one study actually showed a decrease in
er-positive breast cancers with use of hrt.15 furthermore, the effect of estrogen alone, progesterone
alone, or combined hrt on subsequent breast cancer histology has not been clearly examined, and few

studies have adjusted for the duration of total hrt
exposure. inherent in most survey-based studies are
limitations regarding possible misclassiﬁcation of
hormone regimen, lack of compliance data, and
inaccurate recall of duration of use.
the kpnc patient database provided an ideal
opportunity to explore these associations in greater
detail and with improved precision of risk estimates
among diﬀerent hrt regimens. the electronic
pharmacy database allowed a more precise calcula-

tion of total exposure to hrt; assuming no change
in compliance over time, the duration of hrt use
was accurately reﬂected in the number of prescriptions dispensed because few kpnc patients ﬁll prescriptions outside the kpnc formulary system. this
is a more accurate estimation of lifetime hrt exposure than self-report and also provides an advantage
over randomized trials because total time receiving
hrt is known, rather than total time of study
inclusion. further, intent-to-treat analysis may

underestimate the eﬀect of hrt. because kpnc
patients are prescribed estrogen and progesterone as
separate prescriptions, the eﬀects of single-hormone
therapy versus combination therapy and duration of
treatment could be compared.
another key advantage conferred by the kpnc
database is centralized pathology review, where all
er and pr immunohistochemistry staining is evaluated by a team of ﬁve pathologists at one facility.
this minimized misclassiﬁcation of  xxxg1603xxx 
status or histology and precluded concerns regarding
diﬀering antibody use or interinstitutional variation
in immunohistochemical results and interpretation.
our study shows that when adjusted for age among
women aged ‡ 50 years, any use of estrogen or progesterone does not increase the likelihood of erpositive tumors regardless of duration of therapy
(tables 2 and 3). when stratiﬁed by duration of
therapy, combination therapy (combined hrt,
deﬁned as comparable use of both estrogen and
progesterone tablets) taken for at least 6 months increased the odds of developing er-positive disease by
65% (or, 1.57; 95% ci, 1.00–2.45; p = .005) table 4). notably, all patients with >5 years of combined hrt had er-positive breast cancer. in
contrast, among patients with a short duration (<6
months) of any type of hrt, there was almost a 50%
reduction in er-positive or pr-positive tumors.
however, it is difﬁcult to make inferences from
treatment administered for brief durations because
breast carcinogenesis—especially determinants of
histologic subtype—are established well before cancer
is clinically detectable.16
the observed association between any estrogen
hrt use and breast tumors of lower grade and stage
is consistent with other retrospective studies.5 however, potentially confounding factors must be considered for retrospective studies such as these.
women who regularly see doctors for reﬁlls while
receiving hrt may have their breast symptoms addressed earlier than those not receiving hrt. in
addition, women receiving hrt may be more likely
to be referred for mammography earlier and more
consistently, and could have more detailed diagnostic
work-ups as a result of increased breast density
resulting from their hrt use. although the effect of
these potential confounders could clearly affect the
odds of breast cancer detection, their impact on the
detection of er-positive disease in particular is difﬁcult to estimate. additionally, the protective effect
of estrogen hrt on stage at presentation was driven
by those with brief (<6 months) hrt exposure. this
effect may be an artifact of early detection from
ann. surg. oncol. vol. 14, no. 2, 2007

better mammogram screening compliance during the
early period of hrt use.
our study is limited by the lack of data for several
risk factors associated with increased breast cancer
risk. these include family history, reproductive history, and self-reported menopausal status. however,
because none of these factors is known to speciﬁcally
increase er-positive cancers, this would not be expected to have introduced a bias in our analysis.
importantly, body mass index, which is associated
with endogenous hormone levels and postmenopausal breast cancer risk, was not recorded and
therefore could have been another confounder. as
well, concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory agents (especially aspirin) was not adjusted
for, and this has been shown to selectively protect
against er-positive breast cancer.17 most importantly, duration of exogenous hormone exposure was
related to the total number of pills prescribed before
diagnosis and therefore was not necessarily a consecutive measure, but rather a measure of cumulative
hrt exposure from the time of ﬁrst prescription to
the time of breast cancer diagnosis. previous and
continued hrt use versus previous (but discontinued) hrt use are potentially important distinctions
not accounted for in this analysis. because sustained
but discontinued use of hrt may have minimized
associations with different breast cancer types, the
potential effects of time off hrt will be addressed in
a future analysis.
in conclusion, this study is a detailed analysis of
the eﬀect of diﬀerent hrt regimens on subsequent
breast cancer histology. accurate ascertainment of
treatment showed a duration-dependent eﬀect of
combined hrt on likelihood of hormone receptorpositive disease. planned future analyses of this data
set will include evaluation of dose-dependent eﬀects,
chronologic eﬀects, and the eﬀect of race on breast
cancer histology with hrt to determine whether the
eﬀect of hrt on tumor histology is mitigated by
intrinsic patient characteristics.
