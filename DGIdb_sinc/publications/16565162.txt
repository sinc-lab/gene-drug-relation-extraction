choline is an essential dietary nutrient for animals and
humans since it is needed for the synthesis of ach, membrane phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, and other signaling molecules (blusztajn, 1998). in a
classic scenario, the neurotransmitter ach acts on nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) or muscarinic receptors,
and its actions are terminated via hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase (ache) to inactive end-products choline and acetic acid. recent reports have demonstrated that choline is an
efficacious agonist (ec50 ⫽ 1.6 mm) and desensitizing agent
(ic50 ⫽ 37 ␮m) at ␣7 nachr, which mediates type ia currents in native neurons (mandelzys et al., 1995; papke et al.,
1996; alkondon et al., 1997, 1999). choline is a weak agonist
of ␣3␤4* nachr, which mediates type iii nachr responses
in hippocampal slices (alkondon et al., 2003), but does not
activate ␣4␤2* nachr, which mediates type ii currents in
hippocampal neurons (alkondon et al., 1997). (according to
the recent nomenclature for nachrs and their subunits, the
this work was supported by the u.s. public health service grants
ns41671 and ns25296.

and type iii nachrs. using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
from neurons of rat hippocampal and dorsal striatal slices, we
demonstrate that choline inhibited type iii nachr-mediated
glutamate excitatory postsynaptic currents (epscs). choline
inhibited ach-induced n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) epscs in
ca1 stratum radiatum (sr) interneurons of rat hippocampal
slices with an ic50 of ⬃15 ␮m. choline did not inhibit nmda or
␣-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors in ca1 sr interneurons. choline inhibited type ii nachrs in
ca1 sr interneurons with an ic50 of ⬃370 ␮m. the present
results reveal an order of inhibitory potency for choline type
iii ⬎ type ia ⬎ type ii nachrs. it is concluded that brain
nachrs, but not glutamate receptors, are the primary targets
for the regulatory actions of choline.

asterisk next to nachr subunits throughout text is meant to
indicate that the exact subunit composition is not known;
lukas et al., 1999). however, it is not known whether these
non-␣7 nachrs are sensitive to inhibition by choline, similar
to that produced by low concentrations of nicotine (alkondon
and albuquerque, 2005). identifying such sensitive targets
would have major relevance to the understanding of the
neurochemical (cermak et al., 1998, 1999) and neurobehavioral (meck et al., 1989; meck and williams, 1997) actions of
choline, considering that there are multiple pathways
through which choline can be generated at synapses. under
normal physiological conditions, the extracellular free choline concentration in the brain is in the range of 3 to 5 ␮m,
which is approximately 10-fold lower than the intracellular
level (klein et al., 2002), but depolarizing conditions result in
the net release of choline at the synaptic nerve endings.
furthermore, several pathological conditions such as hypoxia (djuricic et al., 1991; klein et al., 1993), ischemia (scremin and jenden, 1989; belay et al., 1991), seizures (flynn
and wecker, 1987; jope and gu, 1991), and brain trauma
result in release of choline into extracellular space via activation of nmda receptors (zapata et al., 1998). the above-

abstract
choline is an essential nutrient and a precursor of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ach) and is produced at synapses during
depolarization, upon hydrolysis of ach via acetylcholinesterase, and under conditions of injury and trauma. animal studies
have shown that supplementation with choline during early
development results in long-lasting improvement in memory in
adults; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect are
poorly defined. previous studies revealed that choline interacts
with type ia (␣7*) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) as
a full agonist and as a desensitizing agent and is a weak agonist
of type iii (␣3␤4*) nachrs. because nachrs play a role in
learning and memory and are generally inhibited by agonists at
low concentrations, we investigated in this study the inhibitory
effects of choline on non-␣7 nachrs such as type ii (␣4␤2*)

nachr inhibition by choline

materials and methods
hippocampal slices. slices of 250-␮m thickness were obtained
from the hippocampus of 10- to 23-day-old rats according to the
procedure described earlier (alkondon et al., 2003). sprague-dawley
rats (zivic-miller laboratories, newcastle, pa) of both genders were
used. animal care and handling were done strictly in accordance
with the guidelines set forth by the animal care committee of the
university of maryland, baltimore. slices were stored at room temperature in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf), which was bubbled
with 95% o2 and 5% co2 and composed of 125 mm nacl, 25 mm
nahco3, 2.5 mm kcl, 1.25 mm nah2po4, 2 mm cacl2, 1 mm
mgcl2, and 25 mm glucose. stratum radiatum (sr) interneurons in
the ca1 field of the slices were visualized by means of infraredassisted videomicroscopy for patch-clamp recordings. in addition,
biocytin labeling was used to identify the neurons morphologically.
dorsal striatal slices. slices of 275-␮m thickness were obtained
from coronal sections of the brain. regions of the sections containing
dorsal striatum were used. sprague-dawley rats (zivic miller) of
both genders were used. handling of the slices and identification of
the neurons were done by the procedure similar to those for hippocampal slices. electrophysiological recordings were performed on
bipolar-shaped or large rectangular-shaped neurons.
electrophysiological recordings. excitatory postsynaptic currents (epscs) and agonist-evoked whole-cell currents were recorded
from the soma of various neurons according to the standard patchclamp technique using an lm-epc7 amplifier (list electronic,
darmstadt, frg). agonists were applied to the slices via a u-tube,
and antagonists were applied via either bath perfusion or via both
u-tube and bath perfusion (alkondon et al., 2003). in some experiments, synaptic nmda currents were evoked by stimulating schaffer collaterals using a bipolar electrode. the bipolar electrode was

placed in the sr region toward ca3 200 to 300 ␮m away from the
ca1 sr interneuron being recorded. signals were filtered at 3 khz
and either recorded on a videotape recorder for later analysis or
directly sampled by a microcomputer using the pclamp 9 program
(axon instruments, foster city, ca). neurons were superfused with
acsf at 2 ml/min. atropine (0.5 ␮m) was added to the acsf to block
the muscarinic receptors. bicuculline (10 ␮m) was added to acsf to
block gabaa receptor activity. methyllycaconitine (mla; 10 nm)
was included in the acsf while studying nontype ia nachr responses. patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary
(1.2-mm outer diameter) and, when filled with internal solution, had
resistance between 3 and 5 m⍀. the series resistance ranged from 8
to 20 m⍀. at ⫺68 mv, the leak current was generally between 50 and
150 pa, and when it exceeded 200 pa, the data were not included in
the analysis. the internal pipette solution contained 0.5% biocytin in
addition to 10 mm ethylene-glycol bis(␤-amino- xxxd2052xxx )-n-n⬘tetraacetic acid, 10 mm hepes, 130 mm cesium methane sulfonate,
10 mm cscl, 2 mm mgcl2, and 5 mm lidocaine n-ethyl bromide (ph
adjusted to 7.3 with csoh; 340 mosm). membrane potentials were
corrected for liquid junction potentials. all experiments were carried
out at room temperature (20 –22°c).
data analysis. the frequency, peak amplitude, 10 to 90% rise
time, and decay-time constant of ampa epscs were analyzed using
winedr v2.3 (strathclyde electrophysiology software, glasgow,
uk). the peak amplitude of nicotinic currents and the net charge of
nmda receptor-mediated epscs and nicotinic currents were analyzed using the pclamp9 software (axon instruments). typically,
the net charge of agonist-evoked responses was calculated for the
duration of the agonist pulse starting from the valve opening.
results are presented as mean ⫾ s.e.m. and compared for their
statistical significance by student’s t test or analysis of variance.
inhibition concentration-response curves were fitted to a hill equation i ⫽ (imax 䡠 an )/(an ⫹ ic50n ), where i is the measured current
amplitude or net charge, imax is the maximum current amplitude or
net charge, a is the inhibitor concentration, nh is the hill coefficient,
and ic50 is the inhibitor concentration that results in half-maximal
response to the agonist.
drugs used. ach chloride,  xxxd247xxx , (⫺)bicuculline methiodide, choline chloride, glycine, lidocaine n-ethyl bromide,
nmda, and trimethylamine hydrochloride were obtained from
sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). (⫾) xxxd2550xxx .hcl was a
gift from merck, sharp and dohme research laboratories (rahway,
nj). mla.hcl was a gift from professor m. h. benn (department of
chemistry, university of calgary, ab, canada). stock solutions of all
drugs were made in distilled water.

choline inhibits type iii nachrs: evidence from
ach-induced ampa epscs in rat hippocampal
slices. in the presence of muscarinic receptor antagonist
atropine, gabaa receptor antagonist bicuculline, and ␣7
nachr antagonist mla, u-tube application of ach to ca1
sr interneurons induced a burst of ampa epscs at ⫺68 mv
(fig. 1a). this response seems to originate from activation of
type iii nachrs, which are sensitive to block by low concentrations of  xxxd2550xxx  (alkondon et al., 2003). the frequency of ampa epscs during application of ach was significantly higher than that observed during resting
conditions (fig. 1g). bath exposure of the slices to choline
(300 ␮m) did not change the frequency of spontaneous
events; however, it resulted in a significant reduction in the
frequency of ach-induced ampa epscs (fig. 1, b and g).
furthermore, bath application of choline did not change the
peak amplitude of spontaneous ampa epscs, indicating
that choline does not inhibit ampa receptors. for example,

mentioned conditions result in approximately 3- to 4-fold
increase in the level of choline from that of control. thus, the
free extracellular concentration of choline is likely to reach a
minimum of 9 to 20 ␮m under various pathological and
physiological depolarizing conditions. another major source
of choline is at central cholinergic synapses during the breakdown of ach by ache. because ach is released at cholinergic synapses at millimolar concentrations, it can be surmised that similar concentrations of choline can also be
generated at microdomains near central cholinergic synapses, particularly during high-frequency firing of cholinergic neurons. furthermore, nutritional supplements with
choline enhance the levels of choline in the brain and have
been recommended for memory enhancement (klein et al.,
1998; zeisel, 2000). because the high-affinity choline uptake
system is not fully matured in the developing brain (klein et
al., 2002), it is likely that during the fetal and early postnatal
period excess free choline will be present in the brain. all
these conditions favor an active role for choline at sensitive
neuroreceptors and compel the need to identify various choline-sensitive receptors.
because cholinergic and glutamatergic terminals remain
apposed to each other in the brain (garzón et al., 1999) and
glutamate axons are enriched with ache (schlaggar and
o’leary, 1994), choline produced at the synapses can interact
with type iii nachr present on the glutamate axons. because both hippocampus and dorsal striatum are regions
innervated by cholinergic afferents (frotscher and léránth,
1985; holt et al., 1996), in the present experiments, we tested
the possibility that choline inhibits type iii nachrs in hippocampal and dorsal striatal slices from sprague-dawley rat
brain.

choline inhibits type iii nachrs: evidence from
ach-induced nmda epscs in rat hippocampal
slices. u-tube application of ach to ca1 interneurons at
⫹40 mv induced outward-going nmda epscs in the presence of atropine, bicuculline, and mla (fig. 2, a–d). like the
ampa epscs, the nmda epscs induced by ach result
from the activation of  xxxd2550xxx -sensitive type iii
nachrs (alkondon et al., 2003). a 10-min bath exposure of
hippocampal slices to various concentrations of choline (10 –
1000 ␮m) resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in
the magnitude of ach-induced nmda epscs (fig. 2, a–f).
the inhibitory effect of choline was reversed upon a 10- to
20-min wash with choline-free acsf. on average, approximately 70% of the response returned to control levels after
the wash (fig. 2e). because incomplete reversal in some
experiments could be accounted for by a slow rundown of
responses with time, the inhibitory effect of choline was
calculated based on the average response from control and
wash. the plot of the mean net charge of ach-induced
nmda epscs against various concentrations of choline revealed a concentration-dependent inhibition (fig. 2f) with
an ic50 of 14.6 ␮m and a hill coefficient of 1.29. however, it
was also noticed that at concentrations of choline ⱕ 3 ␮m,
there was a slight enhancement in the magnitude of achinduced nmda epscs (fig. 2f).
to verify that the inhibitory effect of choline occurred at
the type iii nachr and not at the nmda receptors, we
tested the effect of choline on nmda responses evoked via
three different mechanisms in ca1 sr interneurons. for this
purpose, outward currents evoked by u-tube application of
nmda in the presence of glycine, sucrose-induced nmda
epscs (see alkondon and albuquerque, 2005), and schaffercollateral-stimulated nmda epscs were tested at ⫹40 mv.
a 10-min bath exposure of the slices plus u-tube application
of choline (300 ␮m) had minimal inhibitory effect of both
nmda-evoked currents and sucrose-evoked nmda epscs
(fig. 3, a, b, and e). likewise, bath exposure of hippocampal
slices to 100 ␮m and 1 mm choline had only a marginal
inhibitory effect on schaffer-collateral-evoked nmda epscs
(fig. 3, c, d, and e). these results confirmed that the inhibitory effect of choline at type iii nachr-triggered epscs did
not result from blockade of either nmda receptors or presynaptic sites controlling transmitter release.
next, we tested the mode of interaction of choline with type
iii nachr. if choline interacted by competing with ach for
the agonist-binding site, increasing the concentration of ach
would result in a decrement in the inhibitory response to
choline. to test this assumption, we induced nmda epscs
using a u-tube application of ach at 30 ␮m or 1 mm and
compared the results with that obtained at 100 ␮m ach. the
degree of inhibition by choline did not significantly differ
from each other at various ach concentrations used (fig. 4).
these results ruled out a competitive mode of interaction
between choline and ach at type iii nachr. therefore, it is
likely that choline being a weak agonist of type iii nachr
binds to the receptor, and such choline-bound receptor undergoes transitions to a desensitized state that cannot be
activated by subsequent applications of ach.
next, we analyzed the structural features that are important for the inhibitory action of choline on type iii nachrs.

nmda epscs (a), nmda-evoked currents in the presence of glycine (b),
and schaffer collateral (sc)-evoked nmda epscs (c and d). top traces
represent control and bottom traces 10-min after bath exposure to various concentrations of choline. in a and b, choline was applied via both
bath and u-tube. in c and d, 20 epscs were averaged. recording
conditions were similar to those in fig. 2; however, 10 ␮m cnqx was
included in the acsf in c and d. calibration bars in b apply also to a.
calibration bars in d apply to c. e, bar graph represents the mean ⫾

charge of nmda currents (a and b) and peak amplitude of sc-evoked

respect to the average values from control and wash. the values were
obtained from three to five neurons.

betaine, a metabolic product formed by the oxidation of choline, retains the trimethyl ammonium moiety of choline but
differs by having an acetate moiety instead of alcohol group
at the end (see structure in fig. 5a). the close structural
similarity between betaine and choline allowed us to test the
specificity of inhibitory action of choline at type iii nachr. a
bath-exposure of hippocampal slices to betaine (1 mm) for 10
min failed to inhibit ach-induced nmda epscs (fig. 5,
b–d). instead, exposure to betaine resulted in a slight enhancement in the magnitude of ach-induced nmda epscs
(fig. 5h). the enhancing action of betaine on type iii nachr
response can be attributed to a glycine-like action because
bath perfusion of hippocampal slices with glycine (10 ␮m)
also caused an enhancement in ach-induced nmda epscs
(fig. 5, e–h). interestingly, a 10-min exposure of the slices to
trimethylamine hydrochloride produced approximately 90%
inhibition of ach-induced nmda epscs (results not shown).
thus, the present results suggested that the trimethyl ammonium headgroup of choline is sufficient to induce an in-

hibitory activity on type iii nachrs. the results also suggest
that the presence of acetate moiety in betaine hinders the
inhibitory effect of trimethylammonium group on type iii
nachr.
type ii nachr response is less sensitive to the inhibitory action of choline. our previous studies have shown
that ach is able to activate a slowly desensitizing nicotinic
current, namely type ii nachr current (mediated by ␣4␤2*
nachr), which is sensitive to blockade by dihydro-␤-erythroidine, in ca1 stratum lacunosum moleculare (slm) and some
sr interneurons (alkondon and albuquerque, 2005). here, we
examined the sensitivity of type ii nachr to the inhibitory
actions of choline by recording from ca1 stratum lacunosum
moleculare (slm) interneurons. bath exposure of hippocampal
slices to choline up to 100 ␮m had no noticeable effect on
ach-induced type ii currents. however, choline at 200 ␮m to 10
mm produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the amplitude and net charge of type ii currents (fig. 6). the plot of the
mean net charge of type ii currents versus choline concentration yielded an ic50 of 372 ␮m and a hill coefficient of 1.51 (fig.
6). this weak inhibitory effect of choline on type ii currents was
reversible upon washing the slices with choline-free acsf for
10 to 20 min.
dorsal striatal neurons exhibit choline-sensitive
type iii nachr responses. we examined the putative
nachr responses present in the neurons of dorsal striatal
slices, because this region receives rich innervation from cholinergic interneurons (holt et al., 1996). in the absence of mla,
u-tube application of choline (10 mm) evoked rapidly decaying
type ia currents in less than 43% of the neurons tested (three of
seven neurons). u-tube application of ach (0.1 mm) to neurons
of dorsal striatal slices induced slowly decaying (type ii-like)
currents (fig. 7a) in approximately 38% of neurons tested (five
of 13 neurons). these slow currents were observed even when
10 nm mla was included in the acsf in some of the experiments. in contrast, u-tube application of ach (0.1 mm) at ⫹40

responded to ach with ampa epscs and nmda epscs had
different morphologies. figure 8 illustrates neurolucida drawings of two biocytin-filled neurons from dorsal striatal slices.
although both neurons had type iii nachr responses, only the
neuron to the left (fig. 8) showed type ii-like nicotinic current
as well (see fig. 7a).

discussion
the present study demonstrates that in hippocampal slices
choline is a potent inhibitor of type iii nachr (␣3␤4*
nachr). in contrast, it is only a weak inhibitor of type ii
nachr (␣4␤2* nachr) in the same preparation. the strong
inhibitory action on type iii nachrs is also observed in
dorsal striatal slices. the inhibition of type iii nachr by
physiologically and pharmacologically relevant concentrations of choline (0.01–1 mm) suggests that the activity of type
iii nachr can be regulated by levels of choline in the brain.
since the nachrs in the brain are exposed to choline for
prolonged periods, their density and/or activity can be increased by such exposure, particularly during early development when the choline uptake system is not fully matured.
as the nachrs are important for learning and memory, they
could mediate the memory-enhancing effects of choline observed after prenatal and postnatal administration.

choline is a potent inhibitor of type iii nachrs. our
results reveal that type iii nachr is the most sensitive receptor
target known thus far for the actions of choline. choline at ⬍3
␮m had a marginal facilitatory action on ach-induced nmda
epscs, and this can be attributed either to a glycine-like action
on the nmda epscs (see fig. 5) or to an allosteric potentiating
effect of choline at type iii nachrs. at concentrations higher
than 3 ␮m, choline induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of type iii nachr with an ic50 around 15 ␮m with noticeable inhibition occurring  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m. it is estimated that the free
extracellular concentration of choline reaches between 9 and 20
␮m under various pathophysiological depolarizing conditions
(see introduction). interestingly, the ic50 of choline to inhibit
type iii nachr is lower than those reported to inhibit ␣7
nachr-mediated type ia currents in cultured hippocampal
neurons (ic50 ⫽ 37 ␮m; alkondon et al., 1997), in sr interneurons of rat hippocampal slices (25–100 ␮m, alkondon et al.,
1999), and in neurons of hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus (20 – 80 ␮m; uteshev et al., 2003), or to inhibit [3h]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to muscarinic receptors (ic50 ⫽ 2
mm; palacios and kuhar, 1979). furthermore, choline up to 100
␮m does not seem to inhibit in cultured hippocampal neurons
type ii nicotinic currents (alkondon et al., 1997). in fact, in the
ca1 interneurons of hippocampal slices, choline was less potent
in inhibiting type ii currents as the ic50 for such an effect was
around 370 ␮m, which is more than an order of magnitude
higher than that needed to inhibit type iii nachr responses.
thus, choline exerts an inhibitory effect on various hippocampal nachrs with an order of potency type iii ⬎ type ia ⬎ type
ii. choline differs from nicotine in the inhibitory profile as
nicotine has the order of inhibitory potency type iii ⬎ type ii ⬎
type ia (see alkondon and albuquerque, 2005). unlike nicotine,
choline is the least potent at inhibiting type ii nachr that is
consistent with its inability to activate this receptor. because
type iii nachr responses are present in regions other than the
hippocampus such as the dorsal striatum (the present results)

and possibly other brain areas, it can be predicted that physiological and pharmacological concentrations of choline are likely
to affect several brain functions through this nachr subtype. it
should be noted that neither nmda receptors nor ampa receptors are inhibited by choline.
significance of choline-induced inhibition of type
iii nachr. choline has many known actions in the brain.
choline supplementation in adult rats causes behavioral hyperactivity (wecker et al., 1987). on the other hand, prenatal
and postnatal choline administration produces enduring
changes in brain function in the offspring (meck et al., 1989).
for instance, supplementation of choline during 11 to 17
days of gestation improved memory performance of rats at 24
to 26 months (meck and williams, 1997). furthermore, hippocampal long-term potentiation is enhanced in young rats
prenatally supplemented with choline (pyapali et al., 1998).
these cellular and behavioral effects have been linked to
various effects of prenatal choline observed in the hippocampus such as enhanced ach release (cermak et al., 1998),
decreased ache activity (cermak et al., 1999), enhanced
cholinergic tone (montoya et al., 2000), enhanced nmdareceptor mediated transmission (montoya and swartzwelder,
2000), and, more recently, an altered structure and function
of hippocampal pyramidal neurons (li et al., 2004). however,
it is not clear whether any of these long-term effects of
choline result from its action at the nachrs. because nicotine is able to enhance memory in rats (bettany and levin,
2001) and is able to alter the structure and function of neurons in the brain (robinson and kolb 2004; mcdonald et al.,
2005), it is conceivable that choline may exert some of its
above-described actions via brain nachrs. in fact, it has
been reported that dietary choline supplementation selectively increases the density of nicotine binding sites in the rat
brain in a manner similar to that seen with nicotine administration (coutcher et al., 1992). therefore, similar to the
effects of nicotine administration (alkondon and albuquerque, 2005), choline administration could increase the density/
activity of type iii nachrs in the brain. activation of various
nachrs, including type iii nachr, increases the excitability
of ca1 interneurons (alkondon et al., 2003). the activity of

interneurons controls pyramidal cell firing and various types
of hippocampal rhythms, and thereby contribute to the process of learning and memory (paulsen and moser, 1998; cobb
et al., 1999). thus, choline, by regulating the density and/or
activity of various hippocampal nachrs can produce an enhancement in memory. because the choline uptake system is
not fully matured in the developing brain compared with
adult rat brain (klein et al., 2002), enhanced levels of choline
available at extracellular sites in the brain could have profound effects on the developing brain.
relevance to brain cholinergic signaling. the susceptibility of type iii and type ia nachrs to choline-induced
desensitization has relevance to brain cholinergic signaling.
ultrastructural studies in the hippocampus have revealed a
close apposition between cholinergic axon terminals and
other unidentified excitatory terminals (umbriaco et al.,
1995). in the ventral tegmental area, direct evidence for the
presence of apposing glutamate and cholinergic terminals
has been shown (garzón et al., 1999). since glutamate axons
contain ache as it has been demonstrated in thalamocortical fibers (schlaggar and o’leary, 1994), cholinergic neurotransmitter ach after acting on various nachrs will be
rapidly hydrolyzed to choline. such synaptically generated
choline, if not removed efficiently by the uptake system, is
likely to desensitize the nachrs, particularly the type iii
and type ia nachrs that are associated with glutamate
axons (see fig. 9). in such a scenario, a cholinergic stimulus
will be initially effective in activating type iii and type ia
nachrs on glutamate axons; however, any next stimulus
arriving within a short time will be ineffective because the
nachrs are desensitized by the presence of choline. thus,
choline can play an important self-regulatory modulatory
role on glutamate transmission via selective inhibition of
various nachrs. the precision of such a mechanism will be
determined by factors such as cholinergic impulse frequency,
rate of ach hydrolysis, and choline uptake mechanism.
