 xxxd3336xxx  is an imidazoline derivative with alpha receptor agonist activity widely available in over-the-counter topical ocular and
nasal formulations. more than 1,600 cases of oral exposures are reported to united states poison centers annually (1,2). reports of
significant toxicity from  xxxd3336xxx  ingestion are unusual but have occured primarily in small children after unintentional ingestion
(3–6). we report a case of unintentional  xxxd3336xxx  ingestion with cardiovascular effects persisting for 36 hours.

a 17-year-old, 74 kg woman ingested a “mouthful” from a
12-ounce bottle of 0.05%  xxxd3336xxx  ocular formulation. the patient had a mild upper respiratory tract infection
and mistakenly believed the bottle contained a generic cough/
cold remedy. she reported the amount ingested as about 10 to
15 ml. medical history included chest palpitations and
metoprolol 25 mg extended-release formulation taken once a
day (last dose 22 hours earlier).
upon arrival at the emergency department (ed) 25 minutes post-ingestion, the patient was lethargic but oriented,
with slowed speech and ataxia. she complained of dizziness, a headache, and sinus congestion. vital signs were
temperature 97.5°f, pulse 39 beats/minute, respiratory rate
16 breaths/minute, and bp 153/90 mmhg; pulse oximeter
98%. examination revealed pupils 6 mm and a moist
oropharynx but was otherwise unremarkable. the family
brought in the bottle of generic  xxxd3336xxx  solution,
which on visual inspection appeared to have less than one
ounce missing. the patient was admitted for observation
and received an intravenous infusion of 100 ml/hr of 0.9%
nacl solution. no other interventions were performed. a
12-lead electrocardiogram was not performed but a rhythm
strip showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 45 beats/
minute; no other dysrhythmias were noted during continuous cardiac monitoring. the results of routine chemistry
and hematology tests were unremarkable except for blood
glucose of 174 mg/dl and wbc 17,800. a qualitative urine
received 8 january 2007; accepted 2 february 2007.

drug screen was negative for cocaine, tetrahydrocannabinol,
amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates,
methadone, and phencyclidine. over the following 36 hours
the patient continued to experience drowsiness, bradycardia, and orthostatic hypotension (table 1). she was
discharged to home 38 hours post-ingestion and lost to
follow-up. orders were provided for restarting metoprolol
25 mg once daily the evening following discharge (48 hours
post-ingestion).
absorption of  xxxd3336xxx , with systemic adverse
effects, can occur from both the nasal mucosa and
gastrointestinal tract after intranasal administration (7,8).
clinical reports suggest that  xxxd3336xxx  shares
pre-synaptic  xxxg831xxx -receptor agonist effects of the other
imidazolines (3–6). clinical effects from ingestion of  xxxd3336xxx  have included drowsiness, coma, respiratory
depression, bradycardia, hypotension, hypotonia, muscle
flaccidity and hypothermia (3–6,9–11). in our patient there
was an initial hypertension and bradycardia, followed by a
persistent orthostatic hypotension. there was also early and
persistent cns depression. the adverse effects from  xxxd3336xxx  may include persistent cardiovascular effects,
including hypotension and bradycardia, for 36 hours. it is
unclear if the persistent headache reported by our patient was
related to the  xxxd3336xxx  or the existing sinus congestion, as headache has not been reported previously. additionally, our patient had a history of chest palpitations, but no
arrhythmias or palpitations were reported during her 36 hour
icu stay.
ingestion in our patient was estimated to be 67 to 102 mcg/
kg of  xxxd3336xxx , equivalent to a 2 to 3 ml ingestion of
the standard over-the-counter 0.05% concentration in a 16 kg

child. this is consistent with previous reports of significant
toxicity with similar amounts. (3–5,12).
in summary we report a case of persistent cardiovascular
and neurological effects, lasting up to 36 hours after unintentional ingestion of a 0.05%  xxxd3336xxx  ocular solution.
