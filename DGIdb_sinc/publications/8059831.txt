objective: we determined the teratogenic effects of terbutaline and  xxxd3130xxx , both f32-sympathomimetic
agonists, on the stage 24 (4-day) chick embryo.
study design: we used a topical method of application of terbutaline or  xxxd3130xxx  to the stage 24 chick
embryo in ovo. doses of terbutaline ranged from 5.5 x 10- 10 to 6.5 x 10- 9 mol per embryo, and  xxxd3130xxx 
doses ranged from 4.6 x 10- 11 to 4.6 x 10- 8 mol per embryo. to further determine the pharmacologic
nature of the teratogenic potential of terbutaline or  xxxd3130xxx , the experiments were repeated after
pretreatment with butoxamine hydrochloride, a preferential f32-antagonist, or metoprolol tartrate, a
preferential f3,-antagonist, 4 hours before application of terbutaline or  xxxd3130xxx .
results: terbutaline treatment was associated with significantly higher rates of anomalies than in
controls at all dosages used, whereas  xxxd3130xxx  induced significantly more anomalies at or above doses of
4.6 x 10- 9 mol per embryo. at an equimolar dose pretreatment with butoxamine hydrochloride
significantly reduced the cardiovascular teratogenic effects of terbutaline and  xxxd3130xxx . pretreatment with
metoprolol tartrate at any dose did not significantly reduce terbutaline's potential. metoprolol, at doses
tenfold or 100-fold higher than  xxxd3130xxx , was able to significantly reduce the teratogenic effects of
 xxxd3130xxx .
conclusions: our data suggest that terbutaline and  xxxd3130xxx  are teratogenic in the chick and that
these agents exert their teratogenic effects primarily through stimulation of the f32-adrenergic receptor.

various sympathomimetic amines,  xxxd2401xxx , epinephrine, and norepinephrine, have been shown to
induce cardiovascular anomalies in chick embryos. j -,
examples of the resultant anomalies include persistence of vessels that should normally obliterate (persistent left fourth aortic arch), obliteration of vessels that
should remain patent (absent right third aortic arch),
incomplete formation of the interventricular septum, or
combinations of these. the observed changes in normal
cardiac morphologic characteristics are thought to be

caused by alterations in cardiac physiologic parameters,
such as heart rate or blood pressure, which result in
changes in flow patterns through the embryonic heart
and great vessels. '. " the drugs that cause cardiovascular anomalies are classified as preferential ~ ( xxxd2401xxx )- or mixed a and ~ (epinephrine, norepinephrine)-sympathomimetic agonists. the use of ~l-ago­
nists and the assumption that the receptors in the heart
were primarily ~l led to the assumption that the ~1receptor was significantly involved in adrenergic cardiovascular teratogenesis. however, by means of cultured
chick hearts it has been shown that ~2-adrenergic receptors are also present and functional in the embryonic myocardium at or before stage 24.7. 8 these results
and the recent report of the cardiovascular teratogenicity of terbutaline in the chick embryo suggest that the
l32-adrenergic receptor is also involved in sympathomimetic-induced malformations." terbutaline and  xxxd3130xxx , both preferential l32-agonists, have widespread
use as tocolytic agents. terbutaline tocolysis at 25
weeks' gestation has been associated with human fetal
cardiac toxicity, including myocardial necrosis and fatty
degeneration of human fetal myocytes. io ii terbutaline
is also used as a bronchodilator in the treatment of
asthma. it has been recently associated with cardiac
malformations in the stage 24 chick embryo." we are
not aware of any other reports of its teratogenic effects.
 xxxd3130xxx  tocolysis at 29 weeks' gestation in humans has
been associated with both maternal and fetal tachycardia. 12 • 13 altered cardiac function and ventricular septal
hypertrophy has also been associated with long-term
 xxxd3130xxx  exposure.1 4 it has been tested in rabbits and
rats and at maternally toxic doses there have been no
teratogenic effects. i', currently there are no reports of
the teratogenic effects of  xxxd3130xxx  in the chick embryo.
the reported ~~cresponse of cultured myocytes to
adrenergic stimulation, our demonstration of the teratogenicity of terbutaline, and the reported association
of human cardiac dysfunction after long-term l3-sympathomimetic tocolysis led us to investigate the teratogenic potential of terbutaline and  xxxd3130xxx  and the role
of ~2-stimulation in the induction of cardiovascular
anomalies in the stage 24 chick emblyo.
material and methods

experiment 1: teratogenic assays. fertile white
leghorn (dekalb hybrid) eggs, commercially obtained,
were incubated horizontally and rotated daily under
optimum conditions until stage 24.lb. 17 treatment or
manipulation was initiated at stage 24, a time when the
chick cardiovascular system is highly susceptible to
sympathomimetic teratogenic insult. \ a 1 mm hole was
made in the air space at the large end of the egg. and
a 5 mm square window was cut in the shell above the
embryo. sterile saline solution (50 j.11) was applied to
the underlying shell membrane after the shell had been

removed. a small hole was made with forceps in the
membrane, allowing the saline solution to enter the egg
and the embryo to fall away from the membrane.
removing the membrane allowed a clear view of the
embryo for staging and application of saline solution,
terbutaline,  xxxd3130xxx , metoprolol, or butoxamine. five
microliters of sterile saline solution was applied topically to embryos in the saline solution control group.
terbutaline, butoxamine hydrochloride,  xxxd3130xxx , or
metoprolol tartrate, obtained from sigma (st. louis).
were diluted in sterile saline solution and administered
in 5 j.11 volumes at doses ranging from 3.3 x 10- 10 to
3.3 x 10- 7 mol per embryo for the terbutaline treatment group and 4.6 x 10-11 to 4.6 x 10- 7 mol per
embryo in the  xxxd3130xxx  treatment group. butoxamine
and metoprolol tartrate were tested for teratogenic
potential at doses of 3.3 x 10-" and 4.6 x 10-" mol
per embryo. the window was sealed with clear cellophane tape, and the eggs were allowed to incubate until
stage 41 (day 15) or until death of the embryo. unopened controls were also incubated under the same
conditions until stage 41. at stage 41 the eggs were
opened and autopsies were then performed on all
embryos. autopsy procedure consisted of decapitation
of the embryo, thoracotomy, and dis sec tion of the heart
and great vessels. external morphologic characteristics
of the heart and great vessels were noted, and then the
apex of the heart was pierced with a 25-gauge needle
and the left ventricle was infused with 1 ml of bodian's
fixative. the hearts were opened longitudinally to observe the septum and four chambers.
experiment 2: blocking assays. eggs were incubated under the same conditions as outlined previously
for the teratogenic assays. a window was cut in the shell
above the embryo 4 hours before stage 24, and 5 j.11 of
saline solution, metoprolol tartrate, or but ox amine hydrochloride was administered to the embryonic vitelline
membranes. in the experiments designed to block the
teratogenic potential of terbutaline the concentration of
the pretreatment dose of butoxamine hydrochloride or
metoprolol tartrate was tenfold lower, equimolar, or
tenfold higher than that of terbutaline (3.3 x 10-"
mol per embryo). in the  xxxd3130xxx  blocking experiments pretreatment dos_es of butoxamine hydrochloride or metoprolol tartrate were equimolar, tenfold
higher, or loa-fold higher than that of  xxxd3130xxx 
(4.6 x 10-'1 mol per embryo). after treatment with
either antagonist or saline solution the window was
closed with cellophane tape and the egg was returned
to the incubator. at stage 24 the eggs were treated
topically with 5 j.11 of saline solution, terbutaline
(3.3 x 10 9 mol per embryo), or  xxxd3130xxx  (4.6 x
10-" mol per embryo). the concentration ot terbutaline or  xxxd3130xxx  used was the dose that gave maximum
teratogenicity with minimum mortality, as determined
from the teratogenic assays described in experiment 1.

increase in anomaly rates from 35% (11/31) at

5.5 x 1o- 1u mol per embryo to 95% (18/19) at

sults of blocking experiments using butoxamine hydrochloride at doses equimolar, tenfold lower. and tenfold
higher than terbutaline showed significant reductions in
the teratogenic effect of terbutaline compared with the
saline solution-terbutaline control group, with equimolar doses reducing the anomaly rate from 66% to 37%

compared with the saline solution-terbutaline group.
pretreatment of the chick embryo with metoprolol tartrate at any dose before treatment with terbutaline did
not significantly reduce malformation rates.
treatment with saline solution followed 4 hours later
with a teratogenic dose (4.6 x 10- 9 mol per embryo)
of  xxxd3130xxx  also induced a significant number of cardiovascular anomalies. pretreatment with butoxamine
hydrochloride or metoprolol tartrate showed significant
decreases in the cardiovascular teratogenic potential of
 xxxd3130xxx . butoxamine was able to significantly reduce
the teratogenic potential of  xxxd3130xxx  at an equimolar
dose from 51% to 24% <p < 0.05), whereas metoprolol
tartrate was capable of significantly reducing the teratogenic potential only at doses tenfold or 100-fold
greater than  xxxd3130xxx .

comment
it has been shown that the stage 24 chick embryo is

susceptible to teratogenic insult by sympathomimetic
agonists applied to the vitelline membranes directly

above the embryo. h previous work with chick embryos
has centered on ~i-stimulation, to induce ventricular
septal or aortic arch malformations. one focus of these
experiments was to isolate the ~ i-adrenergic effects on
the embryonic chick heart by blocking the effects of the
adrenergic agonist with preferential ~ i-antagonists
( xxxd2991xxx , metoprolol), mixed 1'1- and 1'2-antagonists
(propranolol), or preferential 1'2-antagonists (butoxamine).'·3 their results revealed that the teratogenic
effects of  xxxd2401xxx  on cardiovascular structures
were reduced from 86% to zero if embryos were pretreated with an equimolar dose of propranolol'  xxxd2991xxx  reduced aortic arch malformation rates induced by
 xxxd2401xxx  from 39% to 4% and the incidence of
ventricular septal defects from 9% to 4%. however, the
ability of butoxamine to reduce aortic arch anomalies
only 15% led to the assumption that 1'2-receptor stimulation was not significantly involved in cardiovascular
teratogenesis. 2 on the other hand,  xxxd2401xxx  is a
mixed i'-agonist, and the chick hearts they were working with have a reported 25% 1'2-receptor population. b
therefore it is possible that the chick embryo is susceptible to 1'2-adrenergic cardiovascular teratogenesis.
in another study  xxxd2401xxx , epinephrine, and
norepinephrine were administered to chick embryos in
an attempt to assay the ability of metoprolol to reduce
the incidence of sympathomimetic amine-induced cardiovascular anomalies.' equimolar doses of metoprolol

tartrate significantly reduced the anomaly rates in  xxxd2401xxx -treated embryos from 85% to 13o/c, epinephrine-treated embryos from 63% to 25%, and norepinephrine-treated embryos from 33% to 3%. these results also suggested that  xxxd2401xxx , epinephrine,
and norepinephrine had their primary teratogenic effect by stimulation of the i3i-receptor. in addition,
metoprolol tartrate treatment alone has proved to be
non teratogenic in the chick embryo." the teratogenic
potential of butoxamine remained unknown until the
current study.
terbutaline and  xxxd3130xxx , both preferential 132agonists, are clinically used as tocolytic agents, and terbutaline is also a bronchodilator used in the management of asthma. before our recent investigation terbutaline had not been reported as teratogenic, although
there are case reports of human fetal myocardial dysfunction after long-term tocolysis. 9 - ij before this report
 xxxd3130xxx  has been shown to be non teratogenic in other
species. 15
our studies demonstrate that the stage 24 chick
embryo is very susceptible to a dose-dependent teratogenic insult by the preferential 132-agonists terbutaline
or  xxxd3130xxx . terbutaline appears to be a more potent
teratogen than  xxxd3130xxx , because a tenfold higher dose
of  xxxd3130xxx  is required to induce an anomaly rate
equivalent to terbutaline. the reduction from the 95%
anomaly rate in the terbutaline-treated embryos in
table i to 66% in the saline solution-terbutaline group
(table ii) may reflect a dilutional effect of the pretreatment volume. a similar, although slight, reduction was
also seen in the  xxxd3130xxx  experiments and may be a
reflection of the higher concentration of  xxxd3130xxx  used.
a possible dilutional effect of pretreatment has been
previously reported. 2 • 4 pilot blocking experiments were
performed to determine the appropriate doses of butoxamine hydrochloride or metoprolol tartrate to use in
our test protocols. as a result, we selected metoprolol
tartrate at doses tenfold higher than butoxamine hydrochloride because of the preferential i3i-action of
metoprolol tartrate and to take advantage of the reported nonspecificity of metoprolol tartrate at higher
concentrations. 19 metoprolol was able to reduce the
anomaly rates at a dose tenfold higher than  xxxd3130xxx ,
but these reductions were not as marked as those
caused by butoxamine hydrochloride in equimolar
doses. metoprolol's ability to reduce  xxxd3130xxx 's
anomaly rate may be a function of the much higher
concentration of metoprolol tartrate than  xxxd3130xxx  at
the receptor site; when high concentrations of antagonists are used, there may be nonspecific crossover to
other adrenergic receptor subtypes. 19
in summary, we have shown that terbutaline and  xxxd3130xxx  are potent cardiovascular teratogens in the stage
24 chick embryo. the preferential 132-activity of these

505

agonists and the reported presence of 132-receptors in
the embryonic chick heart suggests that the 132-receptor
does play a role in mediating the teratogenic effect of
terbutaline and  xxxd3130xxx . the ability of but ox amine hydrochloride to significantly reduce the cardiovascular
anomaly rates in both terbutaline and  xxxd3130xxx -treated
embryos to a greater extent and at lower doses than
metoprolol tartrate also suggests that 132-receptor stimulation is an additional factor in cardiovascular teratogenesis. because of the cross-species differences in xenobiotic metabolism, direct extrapolation of our results
involving the chick embryo to humans cannot be made.
however, the possibility of human fetal exposure to
13-sympathomimetic therapy warrants careful investigation into the teratogenic potential of 13z-agonists.

objective: the purpose of the study was to determine whether the duration of hypertension in the
puerperium of preeclamptic women was related to certain clinical features of disease severity.
study design: we studied 269 singleton pregnancies divided into two groups: 159 with gestational
hypertension and 110 with preeclampsia. the normalization time of blood pressure in puerperium was
estimated as the interval between the delivery day and the first day when each of two to four
self-measurements per day of diastolic blood pressure was observed to be ,.; 80 mm hg for at least 3
consecutive days.
results: normalization time was shorter in gestational hypertension than in preeclampsia (6 ± 5.5
[means ± sd) vs 16 ± 9.5, respectively, p < 0.0001). normalization time of gestational hypertension
showed a significant correlation with  xxxd3472xxx  (r = 0.20, p < 0.025); normalization time of preeclampsia
displayed significant correlations with the week of delivery (r = -0.34, p < 0.005),  xxxd3472xxx  (r = 0.34,
p < 0.025), and urea nitrogen (r = 0.29, p < 0.025), respectively. after stratification by parity, in both
groups the correlations of normalization time with renal data were observed only among multiparous
women, whereas in preeclampsia the link of normalization time with the week of delivery remained highly
significant in both subgroups.
conclusions: the differences observed between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia suggest
that distinct mechanisms or a different maternal answer to the same mechanism(s), in maintaining high
blood pressure in puerperium, are present in the two groups. normalization time might reflect the
recovery time of the endothelial damage in preeclampsia. (am j obstet gynecol 1994;171 :506-12.)

studies of physiopathologic characteristics in the
puerperium are rare and those concerning preeclampsia are generally limited to single case reports. there
are many studies of blood pressure during pregnam:y,i-:<
but no systematic and long-lasting analysis of blood
pressure in the postpartum period has been recorded.
