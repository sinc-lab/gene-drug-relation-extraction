the effects of benzodiazepines on gabaa receptors are dependent largely on the particular  xxxg220xxx 
isoform that is present in the receptor pentamer. the inclusion of either the a4 or a6 subunit is generally
thought to render the receptor insensitive to classical benzodiazepines. we expressed the rat a4b3g2l
subtype in xenopus oocytes and observed that both diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam signiﬁcantly potentiated gaba-gated currents. this potentiation occurred at nanomolar concentrations similar to those seen
at the most abundant “diazepam-sensitive” receptor i.e., the a1b2g2 subtype. in the a4b3g2l receptor,
the effects of diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam were inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of the benzodiazepine site antagonists, ro15-1788 and  xxxd1092xxx . the presence of the b3 subunit appears to be
important for this modulation since diazepam did not affect gaba responses mediated by recombinant
a4b1g2l or a4b2g2l receptors. interestingly, when the a4b3g2l receptor was expressed in hek293 cells,
diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam displaced the relatively non-selective benzodiazepine site ligand, [3h]ro154513, only at high concentrations (>10 mm) demonstrating a lack of high afﬁnity binding for these
classical benzodiazepines. functional studies of the cell-expressed receptors using whole cell recording
techniques showed that neither diazepam nor ﬂunitrazepam potentiated gaba-evoked currents
although currents were enhanced by nanomolar concentrations of ro15-4513. these results suggest that
the observed benzodiazepine modulation of the a4b3g2l subtype depends on the expression system
used and may be speciﬁc for expression in xenopus oocytes.

1. introduction
since their introduction in the 1960s, the benzodiazepines have
been prescribed widely as anxiolytics, hypnotics and muscle relaxants (see korpi et al.,1997). these drugs act as allosteric modulators of
the  xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaa) receptor, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor in the mammalian brain. the gabaa
receptor belongs to the cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channel
that includes the nicotinic, serotonin type 3, and glycine receptors
(sieghart et al., 1999). each receptor in the family is a pentamer of
homologous subunits that assemble to form a central ion channel.
the anion-selective gabaa receptors are heterogeneous, and nineteen mammalian gabaa receptor subunits have been identiﬁed to
date i.e., a1e6, b1e3, g1e3, r1e3, p, d, 3 and q (mckernan and
whiting, 1996; barnard et al., 1998). the major receptor isoform in

the mammalian brain is the a1b2g2 combination where the subunits
occur in a likely stoichiometry of 2:2:1 (baumann et al., 2001, 2002;
farrar et al., 1999), oriented in an anti-clockwise arrangement of
aebeaegeb when viewed from the synaptic cleft (baumann et al.,
2002).
the pharmacology of benzodiazepines is determined mainly by
the particular  xxxg220xxx  isoform that is present in the pentamer.
gabaa receptors containing the a1, a2, a3 or a5 subunits, along
with a b and g subunit, are sensitive to classical benzodiazepines,
such as diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam. in contrast, receptors containing the a4 or a6 subunits are generally thought to be “diazepam-insensitive” although they retain high afﬁnity for the
imidazobenzodiazepines, ro15-4513 and ro15-1788 (derry et al.,
2004; knoﬂach et al., 1996). the results of many mutagenesis and
biochemical studies (wieland et al., 1992; duncalfe et al., 1996)
have attributed diazepam sensitivity primarily to a single amino
acid substitution. in the diazepam-sensitive a subunits, a histidine
at position h101 (rat a1 subunit numbering) is replaced by an
arginine in the equivalent position of the a4 or a6 subunits.
there is abundant evidence to suggest that a high afﬁnity
benzodiazepine site lies at the a  g subunit interface (see sigel and

buhr, 1997) and, not surprisingly, the g subunit has been shown to
play a major role in benzodiazepine binding. whereas the benzodiazepine site ligands, ro15-4513, bretazenil and dmcm modulated
gaba-mediated responses in the a4b3g2 subtype expressed in
mammalian cells, these effects were abolished by substitution of the
g2 subunit by the d subunit (brown et al., 2002). receptors containing
the a4-subunit represent a small percentage of the total gabaa
receptor population in the mammalian brain. the a4 subunit is colocalized with g2 subunits in the hippocampus and thalamus (sur
et al., 1999) and the co-assembly of these subunits appears to play
an important role in epileptogenesis. animal models of epilepsy
suggest that there is a consistent up-regulation of the a4bxg2
subtype in dentate granule cells which parallels a decreased
expression of the a4bxd subtype (payne et al., 2006; peng et al., 2004).
in the present study, we have re-examined the interactions of
benzodiazepines with the rat a4b3g2l subtype. we show that, at
nanomolar concentrations, classical benzodiazepines can signiﬁcantly potentiate gaba currents mediated by the a4b3g2l receptor
expressed in xenopus oocytes and that this potentiation is inhibited
by ro15-1788 and  xxxd1092xxx . however, consistent with previous
reports (ebert et al., 1996; scholze et al., 1996), we did not detect high
afﬁnity binding of diazepam or ﬂunitrazepam to this subtype
expressed in hek293 cells. furthermore, neither of these ligands
modulated gaba-mediated currents expressed in these mammalian
cells, although ro15-4513 potentiated agonist responses as has been
reported previously (kelly et al., 2002; knoﬂach et al., 1996). these
results suggest that benzodiazepine modulation of the recombinant
a4b3g2l subtype may be an oocyte-speciﬁc phenomenon.

were washed with buffer for >15 min to ensure complete recovery from
desensitization.
2.4. transient transfection in mammalian cells and radioligand binding assays
human embryonic kidney (hek-293) cells were maintained in dulbecco’s
modiﬁed eagle’s medium (sigmaealdrich), supplemented with 10% bovine growth
serum (hyclone) at 37  c in a 5% co2 incubator. transient transfection was carried
out using the calcium phosphate method described previously (derry et al., 2004;
hansen et al., 2005). cdnas encoding a4, b3, g2l subunits were added in a 1:1:1
mass ratio to an appropriate volume of 250 mm cacl2, followed by the addition of an
equal volume of n, n-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-amino-ethanesulfonic acid (bes) buffer
(ph 7.04). the solutions were mixed well and added dropwise to the cells.
44e48 hours after transfection, cells were harvested by scraping into ice-cold harvesting buffer (50 mm tris, 250 mm kcl, ph7.4) supplemented with  xxxd302xxx 
(1 mm), bacitracin (0.1 mg/ml),  xxxd207xxx  (0.01 mg/ml) and phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (0.5 mm). the cells were then homogenized, and following
centrifugation (sorvall ss34 rotor, 18,000 rpm, 30 min), the pellets were resuspended in harvesting buffer and stored at 80  c.
radioligand binding experiments were performed as described previously
(newell and dunn, 2002; derry et al., 2004). for saturation assays, cell homogenates
were incubated in duplicate with increasing concentrations (1e80 nm) of [3h]ro154513 in tris-hcl buffer (50 mm tris, 250 mm kcl, 0.02% nan3, ph 7.4) in a ﬁnal
volume of 0.5 ml at 4  c for 1 h. non-speciﬁc binding was determined in the presence of a high concentration (250 mm) of unlabeled ro15-4513. for competition
binding assays, membranes were incubated with a constant concentration of [3h]
ro15-4513 at a concentration equal to its kd value and increasing concentrations of
unlabeled ﬂunitrazepam or diazepam. following incubation, the membrane preparations were ﬁltered through gf/b ﬁlters (whatman, maidstone, uk) using a cell
harvester (brandel, gaithersburg, md) and washed twice with 3 ml aliquots of icecold tris-hcl buffer. filters were transferred to scintillation vials and subjected to
scintillation counting (ls6500 scintillation system, beckman instruments inc.,
fullerton, ca) after addition of 5 ml scintillation ﬂuid.
2.5. whole-cell patch clamp recordings of receptors expressed in hek293 cells

2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals
[3h]ro15-4513 was purchased from nen life science products (boston, ma).
gaba and ﬂunitrazepam were obtained from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). diazepam was a gift from dr. g.b. baker (psychiatry, university of alberta) and b-cce
from dr. b.l. jones (glaxosmithkline, harlow, uk). ro15-4513 and ro15-1788 were
provided by hoffman-la roche and co. (basel, switzerland), and zk93423 and
 xxxd1092xxx  were gifts from schering. gaba was dissolved in frog ringer’s buffer
(110 mm nacl, 2 mm kcl, 1.8 mm cacl2, 5 mm hepes, ph 7.4) and the other
modulators were dissolved in dmso to make concentrated stock solutions. the ﬁnal
concentration of dmso in all experiments was constant at 0.01% (v/v) and this
concentration was shown to have no effect on gaba responses.
2.2. clones
the original cdnas encoding the rat a4, b1 and b3 subunits were from dr p. h.
seeburg’s laboratory, and those encoding the g2l and b2 subunits were provided by
dr d. l. weiss. all cdnas were subcloned into the pcdna3.1(þ) expression vector
(invitrogen, san diego, ca) except for the  xxxg221xxx  cdna which was subcloned
into pcdna3.1(). to improve the expression levels of a4b3g2l receptors in hek293
cells, the signal peptide sequence of b3 was substituted by that of b2. the coding
regions of all subunit clones used in these studies were veriﬁed by sequencing.
2.3. expression in xenopus oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamp recordings
capped crnas encoding rat gabaa receptor subunits were prepared as
described (you and dunn, 2007). stage v-vi xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated as
described by smith et al. (2004). oocytes were injected with 50 nl of 1 mg/ml total
subunit crna in a 1:1:1 ratio (a4:bx:g2l). the injected oocytes were maintained in
nd96 buffer (96 mm nacl, 2 mm kcl, 2 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 5 mm hepes,
ph 7.4) supplemented with gentamicin (1%, v/v) in 96-well plates at 14  c for at least
48 h prior to functional analysis.
oocyte recordings were carried out using standard two-electrode voltage clamp
techniques at a holding potential of 60 mv. oocytes were continuously perfused
with frog ringer’s solution. currents were recorded using a geneclamp 500b
ampliﬁer (axon instruments inc., foster city, ca). the microelectrodes were ﬁlled
with 3 m kcl, and had a resistance between 0.5 and 3.0 mu. in studies of modulator
effects, oocytes were pre-perfused with 10 ml of these ligands for w2 min prior to
activation of the receptor by perfusion with gaba at its ec20 concentration (or ec50
for b-cce modulation of the a4b3g2l subtype) and the same concentration of the
modulator as used in the pre-perfusion. after each current measurement, oocytes

the rat a4b3g2l receptor was expressed in hek293 cells as described above. cells
were plated on 35 mm dishes and whole cell recordings were made 24e48 hours
after transfection. during recordings, plates were continuously perfused with an
extracellular recording solution containing 140 mm nacl, 2.8 mm kcl, 2.0 mm mgcl2,
1.0 mm cacl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm hepes, buffered to ph 7.4 with naoh. patch
pipettes were pulled on a flaming/brown micropipette p87 puller (sutter instrument
co.) using thin walled electrode glass (cat. 5964, a-m systems inc.) and ﬁre polished.
pipette open resistance was between 3e5 mu when ﬁlled with intracellular recording
solution composed of 140 mm cscl, 1 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 10 mm egta, 10 mm
hepes, buffered to ph 7.4 with csoh. cells were voltage clamped at 60 mv using an
axon 200b ampliﬁer (axon instruments) and gaba was applied to a clamped cell via
a second drug- delivery pipette. potentiation of gabaa receptor responses were
measured relative to the response elicited by an ec20 concentration of gaba. diazepam, ﬂunitrazepam or ro15-4513 was bath perfused for 2 min prior to subsequent
challenges with gaba at the same concentration.
2.6. data and statistical analysis
all electrophysiological and radioligand binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression techniques using graphpad prism 4.0 (graphpad software inc., san
diego, ca).
the potentiation of gaba-induced currents by modulators was compared to the
current evoked by the application of a control concentration of gaba (at its ec20 or
ec50 value as described above). the extent of modulation is expressed as
a percentage of the control current using the following equation:
potentiation ð%þ ¼ ½ðigabaþmodulator =igaba þ  100  100
normalized data were then used to construct concentration-response curves
using the equation:
p ¼ pmax ½mn





where p is the normalized potentiation elicited by modulator; [m] is the modulator
concentration, ec50 is the concentration of the modulator producing 50% of the
maximal response (pmax), and n is the hill coefﬁcient.
in experiments estimating antagonist afﬁnities, ic50 values were calculated from
the equation:
i=imax ¼ ½bn = ½bn þicn50



where ic50 is the concentration of antagonist, [b], that reduces the amplitude of
benzodiazepine potentiation of gaba-evoked current by 50% and n is the hill
coefﬁcient.

[3h]ro15-4513 binding data were ﬁt by the equation:
b ¼ bmax ½l=ðkd þ ½lþ
where b is the amount of [3h]ro15-4513 speciﬁcally bound at concentration [l], bmax
is the maximal binding at saturating concentration of [3h]ro15-4513 and kd is the
equilibrium dissociation constant.
ki values of the unlabelled ligands from competition experiments (one site
competition) with [3h]ro15-4513 were calculated using the chengeprusoff (cheng
and prusoff, 1973) equation:
ki ¼ ic50 =ð1 þ ½b=kd þ
log ec50, kd and ki values were calculated from at least three independent experiments
and expressed as mean  standard error of the mean (sem). data were analyzed by
one-way anova and levels of signiﬁcance were determined by multiple comparisons.

3. results
3.1. benzodiazepine modulation of the rat a4b3g2l gabaa
receptor expressed in xenopus oocytes
we have previously reported that gaba activation of the
recombinant a4b3g2l gabaa receptor expressed in oocytes is
characterized by an ec50 of approximately 27.6 mm and a hill slope
of 0.91 (you and dunn, 2007). we have now investigated the
functional effects of two classical benzodiazepine agonists, diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam, on this receptor subtype. following
perfusion with these agents (see methods), the response to a challenge concentration of gaba was potentiated in a concentrationdependent manner (fig. 1). the estimated ec50 values for this
potentiation were 12.3 nm for diazepam and 2.25 nm for ﬂunitrazepam (fig. 2a, table 1). using an ec20 concentration of gaba,
the maximal potentiation induced by diazepam (101.5%) was
higher than the ﬂunitrazepam potentiation (70.3%).

fig. 2. (a) concentration-dependent effects of diazepam (-) and ﬂunitrazepam (,)
on the currents mediated by the a4b3g2l receptor expressed in oocytes in response to
an ec20 concentration of gaba. in (b), the lack of effect of diazepam on the gabaevoked currents of the a4b1g2l (c) and a4b2g2l (b) receptors is shown. data
represent the mean  s.e.m. of at least three independent experiments.

we also investigated diazepam modulation of the a4b1g2l
and a4b2g2l receptor subtypes (fig. 2b). no signiﬁcant effect of
diazepam on these receptors was observed, suggesting that the
presence of the b3 subunit is an important determinant of benzodiazepine effects on the a4bxg2l receptor.
to further characterize benzodiazepine modulation of the
a4b3g2l receptor, we investigated other benzodiazepine site ligands
(fig. 3). these included ro15-4513 and b-cce (negative modulators of
the most abundant a1b2g2 subtype), in addition to zk93423
(a partial positive modulator of the a1b2g2 subtype). these
compounds all displayed some positive modulation of gaba-evoked
currents on the a4b3g2l receptor. the data presented in table 1, show
that the ec50s for ro15-4513, b-cce and zk93423 were 63, 891 and
5.9 nm respectively. the maximal levels of potentiation by ro15-4513
(26.1%), b-cce (19.3%) and zk93423 (18.3%) were similar.
3.2. inhibition of diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam potentiation
by ro15-1788 and  xxxd1092xxx 
to investigate the pharmacological speciﬁcity of the potentiation
of gaba-evoked currents described above, we also examined the

summary of the effects of benzodiazepine-site ligands on potentiation of gabaevoked currents mediated by the a4b3g2l receptor.

control gaba-evoked responses.

effects of two drugs (ro15-1788 and  xxxd1092xxx ) that are generally
considered to be antagonists acting at the benzodiazepine binding
site. consistent with previous reports (kelly et al., 2002), the direct
effects of ro15-1788 on the a4b3g2l receptor were not signiﬁcant
(fig. 4a). however, in competition experiments (fig. 5a and table 2),
inclusion of ro15-1788 in the benzodiazepine pre-perfusion inhibited the potentiating effects of 100 nm diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam
with estimated ic50 values of 7.9 nm and 8.7 nm, respectively. given
the complexity of these experiments in which one modulator is
inhibiting the potentiation induced by another modulator, these
estimates are subject to large error. the effects of  xxxd1092xxx  acting on
the a4b3g2l subtype were more complicated. at high concentrations
(>10 nm),  xxxd1092xxx  caused a potentiation of gaba-evoked currents
(fig. 4). however, the effects of  xxxd1092xxx  on diazepam- and ﬂunitrazepam-induced potentiation were biphasic (fig. 5). low concentrations (<100 nm) inhibited the effects of diazepam and
ﬂunitrazepam but potentiation was observed at higher concentrations of  xxxd1092xxx , an observation that may be explained by its ability
to directly potentiate this gabaa receptor subtype.

receptors using radiolabelled ligand binding techniques. the
a4b3g2l receptor subtype was, therefore, expressed in hek 293 cells
to facilitate such analysis. initial problems of poor expression of this
receptor subtype were overcome by substituting the signal peptide
sequence of the rat gabaa receptor b3 subunit with that of b2 (derry
et al., 2004). in equilibrium binding assays, [3h]ro15-4513 was

signiﬁcantly affect the magnitude of the current, while 1 mm  xxxd1092xxx  causes a signiﬁcant potentiation. in (b), the concentration dependence of  xxxd1092xxx  effects induced by an ec20
value of gaba shows that potentiation occurs only at high concentrations (>10 nm).

shown to bind with high afﬁnity (kd of 4.3  0.4 nm, fig. 6, inset)
which is consistent with previous results (derry et al., 2004). we,
therefore, used [3h]ro15-4513 as a reporter ligand in competition
studies to estimate the afﬁnities for diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam for
this receptor subtype. these experiments (fig. 6) show that
displacement of [3h]ro15-4513 occurs only at high micromolar
concentrations of diazepam (ki ¼ 671  330 mm) and ﬂunitrazepam
(ki ¼ 60.3  23.7 mm). in addition, equilibrium binding studies with
[3h]ﬂunitrazepam demonstrated a lack of speciﬁc binding (data not
shown). thus, although robust expression of the a4b3g2l receptor
subtype in mammalian cells was demonstrated by the high afﬁnity
binding of [3h]ro15-4513, no high afﬁnity binding of diazepam or
ﬂunitrazepam was detected.
3.4. functional studies of benzodiazepine modulation of the
rat a4b3g2l gabaa receptor expressed in hek293 cells
the observations that classical benzodiazepines modulated
gaba-induced currents of the a4b3g2l receptor subtype expressed
in xenopus oocytes yet displayed no demonstrable high afﬁnity
binding to receptors expressed in mammalian cells were perplexing. we, therefore, used whole-cell patch clamp techniques to
characterize the functional properties of this subtype expressed in
hek293 cells. the ec50 for gaba activation was approximately
4 mm with a hill slope of 1.1 (results not shown). these values are
consistent with results previously obtained for the human receptor
subtype in a stably expressing cell line (2.6 mm and 1.3 respectively;
brown et al., 2002). as shown in fig. 7, neither ﬂunitrazepam nor
diazepam potentiated the response to an ec20 concentration of

experiments, [3h]ro15-4513 was preincubated with hek cell membranes expressing
the a4b3g2l receptor at a concentration equal to its kd value for this subtype
(kd ¼ 4.3  0.4 nm). data shown represent the mean  s.e.m. of three independent

manner with an estimated ec50 of 61 nm and an average potentiation of about 40% (fig. 7).
4. discussion
the interaction of benzodiazepines with the gabaa receptor has
been extensively studied because of the therapeutic importance of
many of these ligands and their broad spectrum of activities in
allosterically modulating receptor function. since the cloning of
multiple gabaa receptor subunits, it has become clear that
multiple receptor subtypes exist and that the pharmacological
proﬁle of each subtype depends on its precise subunit complement
(mckernan and whiting, 1996). early studies suggested a subdivision between two groups of receptors; those that included the a1-,
a2-, a3- or a5-subunits were sensitive to classical benzodiazepines
such as diazepam whereas receptors carrying the a4- or a6subunits were diazepam-insensitive (malminiemi and korpi, 1989).
in the present study, we show that both diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam potentiate gaba-induced currents mediated by the rat
a4b3g2l receptor expressed in xenopus oocytes. we also show that
the observed effects appear to be dependent on the isoform of the
b subunit that is present. unlike the receptor containing the b3
subunit, the a4b1g2l and a4b2g2l subtypes did not display such
modulation. although the b subunits have not been implicated
previously in the direct binding of benzodiazepines, the overall
receptor structure is likely to be shaped by all subunits present in
the pentamer since these confer distinct properties to the binding
site interfaces.
it is surprising that the ability of diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam to
modulate a4b3g2l receptor function in the present study occurred
over a similar concentration range to the reported ec50s for the wellcharacterized “diazepam-sensitive” a1b2g2l subtype (dunn et al.,
1999). furthermore, ic50 values for inhibition of agonist responses
by ro15-1788 and  xxxd1092xxx  were also similar to those observed for
the a1b2g2l receptor (dunn et al., 1999; davies et al., 1998).
some of our results on the effects of other benzodiazepine site
ligands are consistent with previous reports. harvey et al. (2002)
reported that a high concentration of  xxxd1092xxx  potentiated the
gaba-mediated currents of the rat a4b3g2 subtype expressed in
xenopus oocytes. although ro15-4513 has been shown to be a poor

 xxxd1422xxx  of gaba responses in both human (hadingham
et al., 1996) and rat (dunn et al., 1999) recombinant a1b2g2
receptors, ro15-4513 is a positive allosteric modulator of a4- and
a6-containing receptors (kelly et al., 2002; knoﬂach et al., 1998).
b-cce is also an  xxxd1422xxx  at the classical benzodiazepine site,
but has been reported to be a positive modulator of the human
a4b3g2 subtype (adkins et al., 2001). however, as found here, this
modulation occurred only at micromolar concentrations, and
adkins et al. (2001) suggested that the b-cce effect may have been
due to its binding to a low afﬁnity, non-benzodiazepine site as
previously reported (stevenson et al., 1995).
the most controversial ﬁnding of the present study is the ability
of diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam to modulate the a4b3g2l receptor.
not only did the effects of these ligands occur in a similar
concentration range to that reported for the a1b2g2l subtype, but
also inhibition by ro15-1788 and  xxxd1092xxx  was similar between the
two receptor subtypes. to our knowledge, there is only one
previous report of benzodiazepine potentiation of the human
a4b3g2 receptor expressed in xenopus oocytes (kelly et al., 2002).
although not discussed in detail, these authors reported a 40e50%
potentiation of the gaba current (at its ec20 concentration) by
300 nm ﬂunitrazepam and a 5e10% potentiation by diazepam
(1 mm).
our results showing a lack of high afﬁnity of diazepam and
ﬂunitrazepam binding to the a4b3g2l receptor expressed in
mammalian cells are consistent with many previous reports (ebert
et al., 1996; scholze et al., 1996; kelly et al., 2002; sur et al., 1999).
our binding studies show that high micromolar concentrations of
ﬂunitrazepam and diazepam can displace bound [3h]ro15-4513.
although this may suggest that the binding sites for classical
benzodiazepines are retained in the cell-expressed receptor, it is
more likely that these effects could be explained by their action at
a distinct low afﬁnity site(s) (see e.g. dunn et al., 1999) that is
distinct from, but allosterically coupled to, the high afﬁnity site for
ro15-4513.
previous functional studies found no evidence for classical
benzodiazepine modulation of the human a4b3g2 receptor
expressed in mammalian cells (adkins et al., 2001; brown et al.,
2002;). also, knoﬂach et al. (1996) showed that diazepam did not
modulate rat a4b2g2 gabaa receptors expressed in hek293 cells
(knoﬂach et al., 1996). as with all expression systems, there is
a concern that not all subunits co-assemble to form functional
receptors on the cell surface. however, as reported previously,
ro15-4513 potentiates gaba-mediated responses in the human
a4b3g2 (brown et al., 2002) and rat a4b2g2 (knoﬂach et al., 1996)
receptors. in the present study, we show that ro15-4513 positively
modulates the rat a4b3g2l receptor expressed in hek293 cells.
thus a high afﬁnity recognition site for this imadazobenzodiazepine is present in the recombinant receptor suggesting that the g2l
subunit, an important determinant of benzodiazepine binding, is
present in the cell surface receptors.
in conclusion, contrary to our expectations based on previous
reports of receptors expressed in mammalian cells (brown et al.,
2002; adkins et al., 2001; ebert et al., 1996; scholze et al., 1996),
we show that, when the rat a4b3g2l gabaa receptor is expressed
in xenopus oocytes, it can be modulated by nanomolar concentrations of diazepam and ﬂunitrazepam. the reasons for disparate
results obtained using different expression systems are unclear.
all of the cdnas used in the present study were veriﬁed by
sequencing and the same cdnas were used for both oocyte and
mammalian cell expression. although results obtained with the
different recombinant systems are usually comparable, signiﬁcant
discrepancies have been described (see lovinger and homanics,
2007), and the reasons underlying the present results are under
investigation.
