abstract
arsenic injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) during early organogenesis to small pregnant laboratory rodents (mouse, rat, and hamster) induces
several congenital defects in the progeny. among those abnormalities consistently and predominantly observed are exencephaly and encephalocele. these severe defects of the central nervous system originate from a corrupted process of neurulation and are better known as neural tube
defects (ntds). in order to understand the mechanism of arsenate-induced ntds, we designed studies in which highly sensitive  xxxg808xxx  nullizygous
mice were injected intraperitoneally with sodium arsenate at the beginning of the neural tube formation process. this specific knockout mouse and
the arsenic exposure conditions were chosen as they were known to provide a high incidence of exencephaly in exposed embryos. we have applied
gene expression technology to the anterior neural tube. this allowed us to study arsenic-induced changes in patterns of gene expression that may
contribute to the development of neural tube defects in these mice. using extensive data analysis approaches including hierarchical clustering and
gene ontology analysis, we identified several candidate genes as well as important ontology groups that may be responsible for arsenic’s
teratogenicity. changes in the expression of several genes in response to arsenic treatment in our model had previously been demonstrated by other
investigators to also induce ntds in murine model systems. these include: engrailed 1 (en-1),  xxxg1709xxx 
( xxxg1709xxx ) and ephrina7 ( xxxg710xxx ). we also found several gene ontology groups that could be implicated in arsenic’s underlying teratogenicity:
morphogenesis, oxidative phosporylation, redox response, and regulation of i-kappab kinase/ xxxg1559xxx  cascade. additionally, we revealed new
target genes which may be responsible for arsenic disrupted oxidative phosphorylation.

1. introduction
arsenic poses ‘‘the most significant potential threat to
human health due to its known or suspected toxicity and
potential for human exposure’’ of the 275 most hazardous
substances found in the environment (atsdr, 2005). this
list, created by the agency for toxic substances and disease
registry, is based on the toxicity, and potential for exposure at
any one of the national priorities list, or ‘‘superfund’’ sites.

while arsenic is ubiquitous in the environment and is found in
varying concentrations in rock, soil, and water, anthropogenic
sources of arsenic including metalworking industries (including the smelting of lead, copper, and nickel), coal
combustion, semiconductors and pesticides production, result
in tons of arsenic being released into the environment every
year. according to the united states environmental protection agency’s (usepa) toxic release inventory (tri), in the
year 2003, 289,629,256 pounds of arsenic or arsenic
compounds were reported released as a consequence of
‘‘total on- and off-site disposal or other releases’’. this is
not a comprehensive number, as only a portion of relevant
facilities are required to report to the tri. the consequence is
a greatly increased circulation of potentially hazardous
compounds into the environment. increased human exposure

to arsenic compounds carries with it unknown health risks for
future generations.
inorganic arsenic, the 20th most common element in the
earth’s crust, is found in the environment in several chemical
forms, and is well known for its ability to cause acute toxicity
and death. it exists in several oxidation states, and those of the
most interest to toxicologists are the trivalent and pentavalent
forms, arsenite and arsenate. humans are generally exposed to
these compounds through contaminated water, food and air.
the chronic effects of arsenic on humans and animals
include, but are not limited to: skin lesions, blackfoot disease,
peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy, hepatomegaly, cirrhosis, altered heme metabolism, bone marrow depression,
papillary and cortical renal necrosis, diabetes and skin and
lung cancer (brown and ross, 2002; icps, 1981, 1992). while
arsenic’s toxicity has never been in question, controversy over
its teratogenicity in humans continues unabated (desesso,
2001; desesso et al., 1998; holson et al., 2000; shalat et al.,
1996). this is primarily due to the limited human data and
questionably designed epidemiological studies (aschengrau
et al., 1989; beckman and nordstrom, 1982; borzsonyi et al.,
1992; ihrig et al., 1998; nordstrom et al., 1978a,b, 1979a,b;
zierler et al., 1988). the primary flaw in most studies
involving humans is that actual maternal exposure is not
determined, rather environmental setting is substituted as a
proxy. in the few studies in which maternal exposure was
directly evaluated, measurements were not taken during the
relevant embryological period of neural tube closure. these
retrospective studies of a link between arsenic exposure and
increased risk of malformation measured maternal arsenic
levels or environmental exposures long after the time when
teratogens would be capable of inducing structural malformations. however, these studies proved valuable by demonstrating that arsenic readily crosses the human placenta and
actually concentrates in the embryo/fetus and placenta during
gestation (concha et al., 1998; eastman and dippel, 1933;
tabacova et al., 1994). acute prenatal arsenic exposure in
humans can result in miscarriage and early neonatal death
(bolliger et al., 1992; lugo et al., 1969).
in contrast to human studies, in vivo and in vitro experiments
in laboratory animal species (mouse, rat, hamster and rabbit)
have consistently shown arsenic to be a potent developmental
toxicant and a teratogen, primarily inducing anterior neural
tube defects (ntds) (chaineau et al., 1990; ferm, 1977; golub
et al., 1998; mirkes and cornel, 1992; morrissey and mottet,
1983; shalat et al., 1996; tabocova et al., 1996; willhite and
ferm, 1984; wlodarczyk et al., 1996). however, it should be
noted that arsenic-induced teratogenicity was mainly demonstrated when the route of adminstration involved using
injections (intraperitoneal and intravenous), and that arsenic
doses used in these studies were high when compared to the
doses likely to be experienced by humans in the environment
(for detailed reviews the reader is referred to: desesso, 2001;
holson et al., 2000). in some studies, arsenic given orally or via
inhalation revealed embryotoxic and/or teratogenic effects but
at the doses presumably toxic for mothers (baxley et al., 1981;
hood and harrison, 1982; hood et al., 1978; nagymajtenyi

et al., 1985; nemec et al., 1998). the relatively high doses of
arsenic used in animal studies should not be a surprise, as lethal
doses for laboratory animals are somewhat higher than the
estimated lethal dose in humans. based on clinical reports, the
estimated minimal lethal dose for humans is about 1–3 mg as/
kg (armstrong et al., 1984; usphs, 2000), whereas available
ld50 values for arsenite and arsenate in rats and mice range
from 15 to 175 mg as/kg (icps, 2001; usphs, 2000). thus,
extrapolation from animal studies to humans is not trivial, and
proper assessment of the developmental toxicity of arsenic will
require much higher quality human epidemiological studies and
thoughtful investigation of potential modifiers to arsenic’s
teratogenicity in animal models. taken together, these currently
available data build a potential linkage between human arsenic
exposure and elevated risks for neural tube and other congenital
defects that bears further exploration (zelikoff et al., 1995). in
this situation, it seems essential to fully understand the
mechanisms by which arsenic may cause congenital defects, as
this will enhance our ability to accurately predict the human
health risks associated with arsenic exposure.
 xxxd2146xxx  enters cells via folate receptors ( xxxg807xxx ’s), also
known as folate binding proteins, and the reduced folate carrier
(rfc1), originally known as slc19a1.  xxxg807xxx ’s are membrane
bound and have both tissue- and cell-specific expression
patterns (ross et al., 1994). murine  xxxg808xxx , which is homologous
to the human  xxxg808xxx , is variably expressed in most tissues
(barber et al., 1999; ratnam et al., 1989). to assess the role of
 xxxg808xxx  during embryogenesis, specifically during the period of
neural tube closure, embryos lacking functional  xxxg808xxx  alleles
were generated by homologous recombination in embryonic
stem cells (piedrahita et al., 1999). in this knockout strain,
stock-folr2tm1fnn ( xxxg808xxx ), nullizygous embryos exhibited
normal neural tube closure and had no grossly detectable
abnormal phenotype. plasma folate concentrations in these
mice were unchanged relative to wildtype controls, and
homocysteine levels were only slightly elevated, not reaching
statistical significance (piedrahita et al., 1999). repeated
experiments consistently demonstrated that  xxxg808xxx  nullizygous
mice display increased sensitivity to arsenic-induced teratogenicity. intraperitoneal injection of 9.6 mg as/kg as a sodium
arsenate administered just prior to and during the onset of
neural tube closure (embryonic (e) days 7.5 and 8.5) results in
40% exencephaly in nulls compared with 24% exencephaly in
treated wild-types. this sensitivity to arsenic-induced ntds
was further enhanced by maintaining dams on a low-folate diet
(wlodarczyk et al., 2001). when the  xxxg808xxx  nullizygous dams
were maintained on a low-folate diet (0.3 mg/kg diet) and
treated with arsenic as above mentioned, the level of
exencephaly rose to 64%, while in the wildtype it remained
relatively stable at approximately 25%.
biotransformation of inorganic arsenic in most mammalian
species requires a series of reduction and methylation reactions
which facilitate arsenic excretion from the body (carter et al.,
2003). recent studies revealed that intermediate trivalent
arsenic species are extremely toxic, which suggest that
methylation might not be the detoxification pathway (aposhian
et al., 2004; le et al., 2000; mandal et al., 2001; petrick et al.,

b.j. wlodarczyk et al. / neurotoxicology 27 (2006) 547–557

2001). in vitro study demonstrates that oxidation of trivalent
arsenic species to pentavalent forms should be considered as a
detoxification pathway (aposhian et al., 2003).
in order to more thoroughly investigate the mechanism of
arsenate-induced ntds, we designed experiments in which
highly sensitive  xxxg808xxx  nullizygous mice were treated i.p. with a
teratogenic dose of sodium arsenate just prior to the onset of
neural tube formation process. this specific knockout mouse
and arsenic exposure conditions were chosen as they previously
produced a high incidence of exencephaly among the exposed
embryos. we hypothesized that disruption of  xxxg808xxx  in
nullizygous mice disturbs methylation and excretion processes
when challenged with high doses of arsenate, extending the
time of embryo-exposure to arsenic. results of our previous
arsenic-induced teratogenicity study (wlodarczyk et al., 2001)
and toxicokinetic study (unpublished data) on  xxxg808xxx  knockout
mice supports the above hypothesis. we have applied gene
expression technology to study arsenic-induced neural tube
defects in these mice. this technique allowed us to develop
gene expression profiles within isolated regions of the target
neural tissue that had been pre-selected for analysis. we
investigated the gene expression changes induced by arsenic in
the anterior part of neural tube in order to discover patterns that
might shed light on the mechanism of arsenic’s teratogenicity.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals, treatment and collection of samples
the stock-folr2tm1fnn ( xxxg808xxx -/-) null mice were housed in
the institute of biosciences and technology vivarium. the
animals were maintained in clear polycarbonate microisolator
cages and were allowed free access to food and water (harlan
teklad rodent diet #8606, ralston purina, st. louis mo) and
were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. virgin females, 50–
70 days of age, were mated overnight with males and examined
for the presence of vaginal plugs the following morning. the
onset of gestation was set  xxxd1891xxx  p.m. of the previous night, the
midpoint of the dark cycle (snell et al., 1948). pregnant females
were randomly assigned to receive sodium arsenate (na2haso47h2o, sigma chemicals, st. louis, mo) or water. on e 7:12
and 8:12, pregnant dams were injected i.p. with water solution of
sodium arsenate at the dose of 9.6 mg as/kg of body weight.
control dams were injected at the same time points with water for

549

injection (usp, abbott laboratories chicago il) as a control
treatment. the volume of each single injection amounted to
10 ml/g body weight. at three selected time points: 8:15 (3 h
post-injection), 9:00 (12 h post-injection) and 9:12 (24 h postinjection), at least four control and arsenic treated dams were
sacrificed and embryos harvested. after a thorough gross
morphological examination under a dissection stereomicroscope
(leica mz95, heerburg switzerland) the embryos were staged
according to somite number and advancement through the
process of neural tube closure (table 1). from these embryos, the
anterior part of neural tube (cut off just in front of the otic pit) was
dissected and transferred separately to a 600 ml plastic tube
containing 15 ml of rnalater-ice (ambion). the samples were
placed in 20 8c for 24 h to allow the tissue to soak the rna
preserving compound, and then frozen at 80 8c and kept until
further processed.
2.2. sample processing and microarray assay
no less than six embryonic neural tubes from separate dams
(three controls and three arsenic treated) for each time point
were used for hybridization on commercially available
codelink uniset 10 k bioarray. each array contains a broad
range of genes (10,500) derived from publicly available, wellannotated mrna sequences. every probe has been functionally
validated against multiple tissues. a set of housekeeping genes
has been included to be used for baseline normalization
procedures. however, for a dataset of this size, a global scaling
technique is definitely preferable. array to array variation is
said to be less than 8% across batches. probe specificity is
claimed by the manufacturer to be approximately 90% probe
homology to target sequence, such that a 3 bp mismatch would
significantly reduce the hybridization intensity. this translates
into the ability to detect a 1.3-fold change in gene expression
with 95% confidence or 2-fold with 98% confidence while
differentiating between targets. triplicate measurements
through replicated array experiments further improve the
confidence to 99.9%, which is crucial for settings with very
large data sets such as microarrays. the sequence information
of each probe (gene) is available on the (http://www1.amershambiosciences.com/aptrix/upp01077.nsf/content) website.
the 3d gel provides support for 30-mers in a matrix that
holds the probe away from the surface of the slide. this
substantially reduces background and enhances sensitivity

(1:300,000), allowing for the detection of one transcript per cell
with 50–200 ng of  xxxd81xxx + rna.
since the limited quantities of total rna extracted from
each anterior part of the embryo neural tube did not enable us to
use standard procedures for probe labeling, we utilized arna
amplification methodologies as previously described by
eberwine et al. (1992) with several modifications. briefly,
total rna was extracted (picopure rna isolation kit, arcturus)
and its quality was assessed on an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer
using pico labchips (agilent). to the rna, concentrated to a
final volume of 10 ml in a speedvac (thermosavant), 200 ng
of t7 rna polymerase primer was added and the sample was
denatured at 70 8c and allowed to anneal slowly at 42 8c. first
and second strand cdna synthesis was performed using 100
units of superscript-ii (invitrogen) and dna pol i (invitrogen).
the dna was isolated by a standard pcr purification kit
(qiagen) and concentrated using a speedvac (thermosavant).
the cdna was then suspended in 8 ml of rnase-free water.
the arna amplification synthesis was performed using
megascript (ambion) at 42 8c overnight in the presence of
biotin-utp. the arna was extracted using rneasy kit
(qiagen) and the volume reduced to 10 ml using a speedvac.
the net arna yield from each embryo neural tube was 10 mg,
and the arna quantity was determined using a fluorometer and
the fluorescent nucleic acid stain ribogreen (molecular
probes). the arna was fragmented in 40 mm tris acetate,
ph 7.9, 100 mm koac and 31.5 mm mgoac, at 94 8c for
20 min. hybridization, coupling of alexa fluor 647-streptavidin (molecular probes), and subsequent washes were
performed according to manufacturer’s protocol (amersham
biosciences). the arna was mixed with buffer component a
and b and then denatured at 90 8c for 5 min. the sample was
then injected into the hybridization chamber and sealed.
hybridization was allowed to go 18 h at 37 8c, while shaking at
300 rpm. each slide was rinsed in tnt buffer (0.1 m tris–hcl
ph 7.6, 0.15 m nacl, 0.05% tween-20) at room temperature,
followed by a wash at 42 8c for 1 h. coupling of biotin labeled
hybridized probe to dye labeled-streptavidin was performed in
a 1:500 dilution of alexa fluor 647-streptavidin. excess dye
was removed by washing four times for 5 min each with tnt
buffer at room temperature. slides were rinsed in deionized
water, spun-dry, and then scanned using an agilent dna
microarray scanner.
2.3. quantitative rt-pcr
taqman1 gene expression assays were used to validate
microarray data for selected genes. gene-specific probes and
primer sets for  xxxg498xxx  (mm01340476_m1), atp5k
(mm_00833200_g1),  xxxg1062xxx  (mm00516004_m1) and sqstm1
(mm00448091_m1) were purchased from applied biosystems
(foster city, ca). the rna extracted from independent
(different from those used for microarray assay), control and
arsenic treated target tissue samples was reverse transcribed
into cdna with high capacity cdna archive kit (applied
biosystems). fifty nanograms cdna of each sample was mixed
with 10 ml taqman1 universal pcr master mix, no

amperase1 ung (applied biosystems, foster city, ca)
and 1 ml probe and primer mixture in a total volume of 20 ml in
a 384-well plate. the assays were performed according to
manufacturer’s protocol on an abi prism1 7900ht
sequence detection system (applied biosystems, foster city,
ca). the thermo-cycling started with a 10 min denaturing at
95 8c, followed by 40 cycles of 95 8c for 15 s and 60 8c for
1 min.
2.4. statistical analysis
initial feature extraction from the images was performed
using codelink expression analysis software v4.0 (amersham
bioscience), and expression values for all 10,500 genes were
generated. intensities for each individual gene were determined
by the median intensity of all pixels within the spot’s region.
subtraction of the median local background (computed from
the subset of remaining pixels of the bounding box) yielded net
intensities representing relative gene expression levels. in order
to compensate for negative intensities, a floor function with
a value of 1 (range is 0–65535) was applied. for equidistant
scaling, all values were logged with a base of 2 and the data
were normalized using a global scaling method derived from
single-channel normalization schemes used by affymetrix
analysis software. expression intensities, ratios and gene id’s
were then merged; the median of the expression values for each
sample at the specified timepoint was used to generate the
effective expression ratios representing the impact of arsenic on
embryonic development in mice during the critical phase of
neural closure. in other words, the comparison groups were the
arsenic treated versus the water injected  xxxg808xxx  nullizygous
embryos, with measurements taken over time. a thresholding
function was employed to eliminate very weakly expressed
genes. this, by definition, occurred where every intensity value
contributing to the higher of the two gene expression levels was
lower than the highest observed signal from negative control
gene spots, plus four standard deviations derived from the
distribution of the set of 481 negative control genes on the array.
the remaining genes were sorted based on their differential
expression and a boundary of 1.5-fold change in expression was
used to produce a list with considerably up- and down-regulated
genes. in addition, a t-test has been applied, where a p-value of
0.05 ensured a consistent expression throughout the replicated
arrays.
for hierarchical clustering, we used hierarchical clustering
explorer software v 3.0 (human computer interaction
laboratory, university of maryland, college park), and the
parameters were set for average linkage using the unweighted
pair group method with arithmetic mean (upgma) and
pearson correlation coefficient.
the data were further analyzed based on gene ontology
groups with the use of ncbis gominer (genomics and
bioinformatics group, lmp, crr national cancer institute)
and arraytrack (center for toxicoinformatics, division of
biometry and risk assessment, national center of toxicology
research, u.s. food and drug administration), web-delivered
gene ontology analysis tools to inquire about their relation-

b.j. wlodarczyk et al. / neurotoxicology 27 (2006) 547–557

ships to known regulatory pathways. the gene ontology
analysis produced clusters of differentially expressed genes
according to biological processes, cellular component, and
molecular function. ontological enrichment analysis of all
differentially expressed genes from all time points collectively
identified numerous ontological groups displaying significant
enrichment ( p < 0.005).
quantitative rt-pcr data were analyzed using sds
software v2.1 (applied biosystems, foster city, ca). mouse
 xxxg861xxx  gene was used as internal control. standard curve
method was used to generate quantitative values. each reaction
was replicated three times and the normalized mean value was
used in final comparisons. the level of gene expression was
compared between arsenic treated and control neural tube
samples. for that purpose the unpaired t-test was applied and
the critical p-value was set at 0.05.
3. results
3.1. embryos collected from dams on e 8:15, 9:00 and
9:12
majority of embryos collected on e8:15 was still in a ‘‘u’’
shape and had just started the process of neural tube closure
(theiler stage 13). there were no visible differences between
the control and arsenic treated embryos. on e9:00 the embryos
were undergoing axial rotation and most of them were already
in a ‘‘c’’ shape (late phase of theiler stage 13). the control
embryos seemed to be a little bigger at this time point and had
on average one pair of somites more than the arsenic treated
embryos. on e9:12 the progress in neurulation was more
pronounced, with all the control embryos having closed
anterior part of the neural tube (theiler stage 14). in the arsenic
treated group the embryos were developmentally delayed and
most of them have closed the neural tube only at closure site i.
at this time point arsenic treated embryos showed significantly
fewer somites than control embryos (table 1).

codelink bioarrays were utilized for this experiment.
statistical parameters, as described above, were used to
identify the most significantly altered up- or down-regulated
genes for each time point. the threshold and t-test were applied
(1.5-fold change, p < 0.05), and those genes meeting this
criterion at any time point were graphed across the three time
points. out of 10,500 gene elements that were present on the
microarray slides, 233 were identified as differentially
expressed in this study (table 2). of these, 121 were upregulated and 112 were down-regulated relative to controls with
31 being unknown. analysis indicated that there were four
genes (engrailed 1, calponin 1, isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase, and carbohydrate sulfotransferase 1) that
displayed differential expression across multiple time points
(fig. 1).
hierarchical cluster analysis of differentially expressed
genes was used to group samples, based on the degree of
similarity of their gene expression profiles across all of the
samples, separately for each time point (8:15, 9:00 and 9:12).
the results of this analysis showed that all control and arsenic
samples (genetic profiles) were clearly assigned into two
separated clusters (fig. 2).
the data were further analyzed based on gene ontology
groups with the use of gominer (zeeberg et al., 2003). the
gene ontology (go) analysis produced clusters of statistically

3.2. gene expression data analyses
the entire gene expression data from this experiment (21
microarray chips representing genetic profile of neural tube
samples from control and arsenic treated mouse embryos) were
deposited on the ncbi gene expression omnibus web page
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/). complete data
can be accessed from this miame compliant depository
database via accession number gse3412.
in concert with the microarray data collection, we have
performed an intensive bioinformatic analysis of the expression
profiles in this unique genetic model of arsenic-induced neural
tube defect. in order to evaluate possible relationships between
arsenic-induced malformations and gene-expression alterations, the anterior neural tube of mouse embryos was collected,
processed, and the labeled arna was hybridized to microarray
slides. a minimum of three biological replicates for each of the
six tested groups were used: three time points (3, 12, and 24 h
after treatment) for controls and experimentals. a total of 21

3.3. quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr)
to independently validate gene expression results obtained
by the microarray analysis we applied the taqman1 gene
expression assay, which allows detection and quantification of
mrna. the expression levels of four genes that showed
differential pattern of expression (two up- and two downregulated genes) in neural tube samples from control and
arsenic exposed embryos were quantified using taqman1 rtpcr and compared to those levels determined by the
microarray assay. more specifically we chose two genes
(hmx1 and sqstm1) that were upregulated by the arsenic
exposure and two genes (cox7 and atp5k) down regulated. the
qrt-pcr results confirmed the microarray outcomes; hmx1
and sqstm1 were up regulated and cox7 and atp5k were
significantly down regulated in the arsenic treated neural tube
samples as compared to the control samples (fig. 3). the

4. discussion
embryonic arsenic exposure via maternal i.p. injections
leads to a well-described pattern of fetal malformations in mice
(golub et al., 1998; hood et al., 1978; morrissey and mottet,
1983; wlodarczyk et al., 2001). it has also been demonstrated
that arsenic interferes with normal gene expression in both cell
and animal models, but the mechanism by which arsenic
exposure induces malformation and alters gene expression
remains to be elucidated. we suggest that these changes in gene
expression are responsible, at least in part, for arsenic-induced
malformations. this is supported by the fact that disrupting the
expression of several arsenic responsive genes has previously
been demonstrated to induce defects in mouse models. these
genes included engrailed 1 (en-1), platelet derived growth
factor receptor alpha ( xxxg1709xxx ) and ephrina7 ( xxxg710xxx ).
inhibition of en-1 by antisense targeting has resulted in
craniofacial abnormalities (augustine et al., 1995), disruption
of  xxxg1709xxx  was associated with craniofacial clefts, and cleft
palate (tallquist and soriano, 2003), and targeted gene
disruption of  xxxg710xxx  has been shown to induce exencephaly
(depaepe et al., 2005). the gene expression analyses were
designed in order to identify genetic alterations produced by

teratogenic arsenic exposure. we observed that these changes
were dynamic, in that the set of genes altered by arsenic
depended directly on the time point following exposure.
gestational staging of embryos by somite numbers demonstrated that a delay in embryological development was induced
by arsenic. knowing that, in subsequent microarray studies,
control and treated embryos were collected at the same time
points and had developed to a comparable stage of development
as determined by the number of somites. at the first two time
points (e8:15 and 9:0) this developmental delay was very
slight, as the vast majority of the control and arsenic treated
embryos were in mid-neural tube closure at the closure site i. at
that time, the average control embryo was slightly developmentally ahead of the arsenic treated embryos (0.5–0.9
somite pair) with respect to somitogenesis. even though the
difference between treated and control somite numbers were
more pronounced at e9:12 (table 1), we were still able to select
control and treated embryos with comparable numbers of
somites (18–19 pair of somites). despite of the equivalent
number of somites observed, the control embryos were
significantly more advanced in terms of the neurulation
process, when compared to the as treated embryos. analysis
of the genetic changes that coincided with these developmental
changes indicated essential housekeeping genes were altered by
arsenic exposure (up regulated:  xxxg2409xxx ,  xxxg217xxx , mphosph10,
snrpa and down regulated: syncrip). globally, alterations
induced by arsenic included changes in genes providing
housekeeping functions, morphogenesis, response to hypoxia,
and regulation of i-kappab kinase/ xxxg1559xxx  cascade
(globally changed in table 4).
it is generally hypothesized that multiple genes and
pathways are responsible for complex birth defects (mitchell,
2005). therefore, the aim of the present study was to observe
alterations in the gene expression of the anterior neural tube that

553

precede the genesis of neural tube defects in arsenic treated
mouse fetuses. characterization of gene alteration in the
embryonic tissues that ultimately generates these malformations produced lists of up or down regulated genes, and these
genes were then classified by gene ontologies. genes identified
by their relevance to toxicant response and dysmorphogenesis
are described below, identified by the gene ontology group to
which they belong, and clustered based on the timepoint they
were shown to have altered expression.
4.1. three-hour post-treatment
4.1.1. pkinase cascade
 xxxg1062xxx  ( xxxg1062xxx ) is a hallmark for arsenicinduced stress (liu et al., 2001). an essential enzyme in heme
catabolism, it cleaves heme to form biliverdin a strong
antioxidant. in addition to its substrate, heme, its activity is also
strongly induced by many agents causing oxidative stress.
microarray results indicated that  xxxg1062xxx  was the most
upregulated gene in the arsenic treated anterior neural tubes.
4.1.2. stress (temp)
heat shock protein a1b (hspa1b) is also known as 70 kda,
hsp70, hsp68, hsp70a1, hsp70-1, and hsp70.1. heat shock
proteins (hsps) are a family of proteins that are induced by
stressors such as heat and toxicants, and it is thought that the
expression results in enhanced thermotolerance and chemotolerance. while the necessary induction of hsps is well
established during organogenesis in the rodent embryo,
expression may also help provide protection against dysmophogenesis induced by toxicants. work by hunter and dix
(2001) suggests that hsp70-1 and hsp70-3 are both necessary
and sufficient to prevent arsenite-induced dysmorphology in
early-somite staged mouse embryos. both hspa1b and dnajc8

(another member of heat shock proteins, hsp40) were
demonstrated to be highly upregulated at the earliest timepoint
following arsenic treatment, and are known to participate
together as a chaperone complex.
4.1.3. morphogenesis
aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily a2 ( xxxg128xxx )
is also known as  xxxg127xxx ,  xxxg128xxx , aldh1a7, raldh-2 and
av116159. retinaldehyde dehydrogenase converts retinal to
 xxxd3417xxx  (ra). ra expression is tissue and time specific,
and is a developmental signal implicated in the formation of the
neural axis. ra serves as a ligand for nuclear receptors, which
influence transcriptional regulation of genes containing retinoic
acid responsive element (rare). at e8:12, ra can be detected
in the mouse hindbrain.  xxxg128xxx -/- knockout mice die by e10:12
with heart defects (mic et al., 2002), whereas excess of ra
leads to defects in neural crest cell derived structures such as
craniofacies, heart, axial skeleton, and eyes.  xxxg128xxx  was
upregulated in the arsenic treated samples, and may possibly
drive additional ra synthesis.
4.1.4. translation elongation factor
the sulfhydryl amino acid homocysteine is associated with
an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and birth defects
(rasouli et al., 2005; splaver et al., 2004). homocysteine and
methionine, both of which are part of the active methyl cycle,
have also been shown to influence the expression of elongation
factor-1delta (ef-1delta) in endothelial cells (chacko et al.,
1998). this gene, a member of a multimeric complex regulating
mrna translation, was also differentially expressed after
arsenic exposure. furthermore, alterations in the s-adenosyl
methionine to  xxxd3157xxx  (sam:sah) ratio of
the active methyl cycle have been demonstrated in  xxxg808xxx  mice
in a previous study (spiegelstein et al., 2005). as in the
endothelial model, these alterations in the active methyl cycle
appear to induce the expression of ef-1delta and may thereby
mediate accelerated synthesis of free sulfhydryl-containing
proteins in response to oxidative stress (chacko et al., 1998).
4.2. twelve-hour post-treatment
4.2.1. ribosome
ribosomal proteins are integrally involved in protein
synthesis. the numerous proteins of the ribosomal subunits
have multiple sequential steps that must be followed in order to
properly initiate and translate mrnas to proteins. the genes
 xxxg1978xxx , rpl13, rpl14, and rpl18a are all found in the 60s
ribosomal subunit. this subunit joins with the 48s initiator
complex at the initiation complex of mrnas, functionally
forming the active 80s ribosome.  xxxg1978xxx , which is also known
as qm, has been identified as a putative tumor suppressor, and it
may also influence various signal transduction pathways
involving sh3 domain-containing membrane proteins (oh
et al., 2002). the gene rpl14 is also suggested to be a tumor
suppressor gene (shriver et al., 1998). therefore, the changes in
expression of these ribosomal genes during development may
directly alter ribosome biosynthesis required for cell prolifera-

tion and growth. these alterations may thereby increase the
vulnerability of an embryo to a neural tube defect if there were
delays in cellular proliferation and growth during neural tube
closure. we observed such delays in growth in arsenic exposed
embryos, and other studies have also demonstrated that
inactivation of ribosome is similarly embryotoxic and
teratogenic (chan et al., 1993, 1994).
4.2.2. apoptosis
 xxxd226xxx  (ato) has been shown to induce
differentiation and apoptosis in acute  xxxg1785xxx 
(apl) cells with concomitant upregulation of r1 and r2
 xxxg2298xxx /trail ( xxxg2296xxx -related apoptosis-inducing ligand) receptors (akay et al., 2004; liu et al., 2003). we
observed alteration of  xxxg2298xxx /trail in response to pentavalent
arsenic exposure. these changes in  xxxg2298xxx /trail may parallel
what is seen in ato exposed cells, in that ato induces  xxxg2298xxx /
trail, activates caspase cleavage of bid, a pro-apoptotic
bcl-2 family member, which depolarizes the mitochondrial
membrane and releases apoptosis-inducing factor from
mitochondria in a bcl-2 independent fashion (akay et al.,
2004; liu et al., 2003; susin et al., 1999). inducible expression
of pycard/tms1 has also been shown to inhibit cellular
proliferation and induce dna fragmentation (mcconnell and
vertino, 2000). since methylation of the cpg islands
surrounding exon 1 of pycard/tms1 has been indicated
in controlling its gene expression (conway et al., 2000), the
biotransformation of arsenic may also directly influence the
expression of pycard/ms1 by depleting the availability of
methyl-groups and altering sam:sah (spiegelstein et al.,
2005).
4.3. twenty-hour post-treatment
4.3.1. anion transporter
voltage-dependent anion channel ( xxxg2409xxx ) is also known as
vdac5. the voltage-dependent anion channel ( xxxg2409xxx ) is a
small, abundant pore-forming protein found in the outer
mitochondrial membrane. it is hypothesized that mitochondrial
membrane potential and the release of  xxxg569xxx , initiating
apoptosis, is regulated by the binding of  xxxg250xxx  family of
proteins to the vdacs (shimizu et al., 1999). the  xxxg250xxx  family
of proteins’ members may be anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic,.
 xxxg2409xxx  is upregulated in the arsenic treated samples.
atp synthase, h+ transporting mitochondrial f1 complex,
 xxxg217xxx  ( xxxg217xxx ). atp synthase harnesses the energy of
proton flux through the inner mitochondrial membrane to
synthesize atp from adp during oxidative phosphorylation.
 xxxg217xxx  expression was upregulated in the arsenic treated
samples.
4.4. global analysis
a global analysis was performed on all differentially
expressed genes at all time points. global analysis using
gominer indicated that the three most highly enriched go
groups were i-kappab kinase/ xxxg1559xxx  cascade, oxidative

b.j. wlodarczyk et al. / neurotoxicology 27 (2006) 547–557

phosphorylation, and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1
complex.
the i-kappab kinase/ xxxg1559xxx  cascade is activated by a
wide range of cellular toxicants such as cytokines, reactive
oxygen species (ros), uv radiation, and many others.
i-kappab kinase, an inhibitor of  xxxg1559xxx , is phosphorylated
in the event of cellular challenge. the phosphorylation marks
the i-kappab proteins for proteolysis via the ubiquitination
pathway, allowing activation of the  xxxg1559xxx  complex.
 xxxg1559xxx , a nuclear receptor, translocates to the nucleus
where it binds to  xxxg1559xxx  response elements in the
regulatory regions of inducible genes, the expression of which
help protect the cell from apoptosis. this gene cluster included
sqstm1, birc2, eef1d,  xxxg1062xxx ,  xxxg1321xxx , and tnfrsf10b.
oxidative phosphorylation is the main method of energy
production in the cell, using a high-energy electron passed
through several respiratory enzyme complexes that pump h+
out of the inner membrane of the mitochondria. this proton
gradient is used by atp synthase to form atp from adp and
phosphate. atp is essential to the completion of energetically
unfavorable chemical reactions in the cell. the genes
represented in this ontology group include the last three
enzymes in the electron transport chain (rfk, bcs1l,  xxxg498xxx )
and a two subunits of atp synthase (atp5k and  xxxg217xxx ).
the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 complex
ontology cluster consisted of eef1a2 and eef1d. these
elongation factors control the recruitment of amino-acylated
trna to the ribosome and regulate the translocation of the
growing polypeptide (hershey, 1991). elongation factor 1a,
one of the most abundant proteins in the cell is also involved in
cytoskeleton organization (condeelis, 1995).
an evaluation of the relationship between the genes in the
first two ontology groups suggests a clear pathway for cellular
damage and response to this damage. downregulation of the
enzymes in the electron transport chain compromises oxidative
phosphorylation, reducing available atp, and perhaps more
importantly, causes reactive oxygen species (ros) spilling,
primarily consisting of superoxide anions into the cell. as these
ros overwhelm the cell’s antioxidant capabilities, oxidative
stress ensues. ros disrupt cells through two main pathways:
physical damage, and altered cellular signaling. in addition,
damage from ros may initiate a feedback loop, causing
continued cellular damage. the genes from the i-kappab
kinase/ xxxg1559xxx  cascade were upregulated, and may indicate
an attempt by the cell to ameliorate the damage induced by the
ros. the most highly upregulated gene observed in the e8:15
neural tube array was the anti-oxidant  xxxg1062xxx  (heme
oxygenase), which is considered to be the hallmark of arsenic
exposure. it has been proposed that damage to proteins induces
heat shock proteins 40 and 70 (hsp40 and hsp70). when
damaged proteins overwhelm the cell’s ability to stabilize or
degrade them, the sequestosome-ubiquitin sequestration system is induced, which isolates damaged proteins from the
cytosol for later proteolysis. microarray evidence suggests this
scenario may be occurring in our model.
arsenic can exert its toxic effect via several pathways: as a
phosphate analog it interferes with phosphorylation reactions

555

and competes with phosphate in atp formation, through
reactions with enzyme sulfhydryl groups it can inhibit many
biochemical cell processes. there has been increasing evidence
that arsenic toxicity is associated with free radical generation
and that oxidative stress might be responsible for observed
adverse effects. ros not only can cause dna and protein
damage but also cellular lipid peroxydation. additionally they
can serve as signaling molecules in the pathway leading to cell
apoptosis (shi et al., 2004). results of our study seem to
endorse that arsenic exerts its toxic effect via oxidative stress
pathways. analysis of gene expression in the neural tube of
arsenic exposed embryos indicated that there was a significant
dysregulation in a group of genes directly involved in the
mitochondrial process of energy production. disruption of this
process leads to uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation, which
ultimately causes oxidative stress. analysis of microarrays also
showed that arsenic strongly activated the i-kappab kinase/ xxxg1559xxx  cascade which in turn launched several early response
genes in response to oxidative stress. additionally, besides
confirming  xxxg1062xxx  as a main marker gene of acute arsenic
intoxication we revealed for the first time new target genes
changed in expression by arsenic caused disruption of the
oxidative phosphorylation process.
