abstraet--l. administration of  xxxd1806xxx  for over one month reduced the levels of  xxxg730xxx  (er)
and its mrna to approximately 50 and 20%, respectively in monocytes.
2.  xxxd1806xxx  did not alter the degradation rate of er mrna in monocytes.
3.  xxxd1806xxx  decreased the transcription rate ofer gene to approximately 50% in monocytes in a run-on
assay.
4.  xxxd1806xxx  may release estrogen predominance via the reduction of transcription for er gene, which
leads to the reduction of er mrna and er expressions in monocytes.

introduction
in the peritoneal effusion of the patients with pelvic
endometriosis, peritoneal macrophages are induced
and activated. the macrophages generate and secrete
interleukin-1 (il-i) and/or  xxxg2296xxx 
(tnf) (fakih et al., 1987; eisermann et al., 1988),
resulting in the damage of gametocytes, the disturbance of fertilization and embryo development in
the fallopian tube (hill et al, 1987, 1989). ovarian
steroids, especially estrogens modulate the induction
of il-1 and tnf production in peritoneal macrophages (polan et al., 1988).
generally, macrophages are derived from peripheral monocytes. the induction of il-1 and t n f
productions in peripheral monocytes is enhanced by
estradiol 17-fl (e2) and progesterone (p), and inhibited by  xxxd1806xxx  (mori et al., 1990). peripheral monocytes have estrogen receptors (er), and  xxxd1806xxx 
reduces the er level in vitro (wada et al., 1992).
therefore, from the aspect of protein synthesis, the
level of er mrna in peripheral monocytes as a
substitute of peritoneal macrophages was determined
during the menstrual cycle, with the comparison of
the level of er. the level of er mrna in peripheral
monocytes of  xxxd1806xxx -treated women was also deter*to whom all correspondence should be addressed.

mined. the effects of danazoi on the stability of er
mrna and transcription of er genes to er mrna
were studied to clarify the mechanism of decrease of
the er level by  xxxd1806xxx .

materialsand methods
chemicals
estradiol-17fl (e2), diethylstilbestrol (des, 3,4bis[p-hydrooxyphenyl]-3-hexene) and dihydrotestosterone (dht) were purchased from sigma chemical
co. (st. louis, mo).  xxxd1806xxx  (17ct-pregn-4-en-20yno [2,3-d] isoxazol-17-ol) was from starlingwinthrop, new york, ny. all other chemicals and
reagents were of experimental grade.
isolation o f peripheral monocytes and mononuclear
cells
heparinized peripheral blood (200 ml) was collected from healthy 15 women (ranging from 20 to 44
years of age) with a regular menstrual cycle, which
was confirmed by basal body temperature, and from
10 patients (ranging from 23 to 43 years of age) with
pelvic endometriosis diagnosed by endoscopy, and
followed by treatment with  xxxd1806xxx  over one month.
agreements for the study were obtained from the
research committee for human subjects, gifu university school of medicine, and patients, who came

to the department of obstetrics and gynecology,
gifu university school of medicine from july 1992
to june 1993. the endometrial phases of the menstrual cycle were divided histologically into the early
proliferative phase, the late proliferative phase, and
secretory phase.
peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated
by  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque (pharmacia fine chemicals,
piscataway, n j) gradient centrifugation at 400 g for
30min. mononuclear cells at the interface were
washed twice with hanks'  xxxd2988xxx 
(hbss) for isolation. mononuclear cells were suspended at a concentration of 2 x 106 ceu/ml in eagle
mem medium, and incubated at 37°c for 60 min for
monocytes to adhere to the petri dish coated with
fetal calf serum. after washing off non-adherent cells
among mononuclear cells, the adherent cells as
monocytes on the surface of the petri dish were
recovered by exposure of l mm edta for 15min
and washed with hbss for isolation.

each soluble fraction was diluted with an adequate
volume of teg buffer at least by the concentration
of 1 mg protein/ml, to avoid the interference of
various proteins of each specimen. protein in cytosol
and nuclear kci extract fractions was measured by
the bradford method (bradford, 1976).

preparation o f specimens for determination o f er level
(wada et al., 1992)

in vitro competition assay

peripheral monocytes were disrupted by sonication
in a heat system sonicator (sonifier, branson, cn)
at the concentration of 5-10 x 105cell/ml in 2ml
t e g buffer [10mm tris-hc1, 1.5mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta), 10% glycerol,
ph 7.4] at an output of 70 w for 5 sec three times
with intermittent cooling of 15 see. disruption of all
monocytes was confirmed by light microscopy after
peroxidase staining. all subsequent steps were carried
out at 4°c, except when indicated. the d n a amount
in monocytes was determined according to burton's
method (burton, 1956) with a 0.5 ml aliquot of the
suspension before the first centrifugation.
this suspension was centrifuged at 800g for
10min. the 800g supernatant was centrifuged at
160,500 g for 60 min. the supernatant, designated as
cytosol fraction, was treated with the same volume of
dextran (0.03%) coated charcoal (0.3%) (0.3% dcc)
for 60 min to remove all free steroids.
the 800g pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml kc!
buffer [10 mm tris-hcl, 1.5 mm edta, 10% glycerol, 0.6 m kci ph 8.5] for 60 rain with vigorous
mixture every 15 min. the 800g pellet solubilized
with kci buffer was obtained by centrifugation at
90,300 g for 30 min. this supernatant, designated as
nuclear kci extract fraction, was treated with 0.3%
dcc for 60 min, and diluted with at least a three
times volume of teg buffer.
the 90,300g pellet was resuspended in 1 ml
teg buffer, and designated as nuclear kcl-insoluble
fraction.

 xxxg730xxx  assay (wada et al., 1992)
each fraction (100pl) was incubated with
1.0-8.0 nm
[3h]-e2 ((2,4,6,7,-3h)-estradiol- i 7fl,
95.4 ci/mmol, new england nuclear corp., boston,
ma) plus a 200-fold molar excess dht, and those
with or without a 200-fold molar excess of des at
20°c for 120min. the bound form of the soluble
fractions (cytosol and nuclear kci extract fractions)
was determined by the dcc adsorption method, and
that of the insoluble fraction (nuclear kci insoluble
fraction) by washing and pelleting. scatchard plot
analysis (scatchard, 1979) was carried out. in this
study, the so-called type i er alone (clark et al.,
1979) was determined.

the dcc-treated cytosol fraction (100#1) was
incubated with [3h]-e2 (1 nm) with a 200-fold
molar excess of dht alone or together with
increasing various concentration of des and  xxxd1806xxx 
(0-103-fold molar excess) at 20°c for 120 min. free
form in cytosol fraction was removed by dcc,
and the binding quantity of cytosol fraction was
determined (dcc adsorption method).
isolation o f rna and reverse transcription (rt)
total rnas from peripheral blood monocytes and
mononuclear cells were isolated by acid guanidium
thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method
(chomczynski and sacchi, 1987). human er crna
was synthesized from a human er cdna clone
(kindly provided by dr geoffery l. greene of the
university of chicago), which was deleted 159 bp
with apali and hphi in the plasmid pgem-3, using
sp6 promotor after the treatment of ecori. the
synthesized rna concentration was determined
by spectrophotometric absorbance at 260 nm and
electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining.
total rna (3#g) with er crna (5pg) was
reverse transcribed with moloney murine leukemia
virus-reverse transcriptase (mmlv-rtase, 200 units,
gibco brl, gatherburg, md) in 100 #l of reaction
mixture including 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.4, 50 mm
kc1, 2.5mm mgcl2, 0.1 mg/ml bsa, 10ram dtt
and 0.5mm deoxynucleotides using an antisense
specific primer (er-a: 904-924 (exon 8) 5'-caaggccaggctgttcttctt-3' for coding sequences
of human er) at 37°c for 60 min. the rt reaction

decrease of er gene transcription
mixture was heated at 94°c for 5 min to inactivate
mmlv-rtase.

amplification of  xxxg730xxx  (er) mrna polymerase chain reactions (pcr)
pcr for er m r n a was carried out with reverse
transcribed cdnas from total rna from peripheral
blood monocytes and mononuclear cells with er
crna as templates and 0.1 p m specific primers
(er-s: 490-510 (exon 2) 5 ' - a g a t t g g c c a g t a c caatgac-3', er-a: 904-924; (exon 8) 5'-caaggccaggctgttcttctt-3' for coding sequences
of human er) in 10 mm kci, 20mm tris-hcl
ph 8.8, 10mm (nh4)2so4, 2 m m  xxxd2534xxx , 0.1%
triton x- 100, 0.15 mm deoxynucleotide phosphates,
vent d n a polymerase (2 units/100 #1 reaction, new
england biolab, beverly, ma), using an i w a k i
thermal sequencer tsr-300 (iwaki glass, tokyo,
japan). thirty cycles of pcr were performed consisting of 1 min at 94°c for denaturation, 1 min at 55°c
for annealing, and 1 min at 72°c for extension.

analysis of quantities of er mrna (southern blot for
pcr products)
pcr products were applied to 1.2% agarose gel
and electrophoresis was performed at 50-100 v. pcr
products were capillary-transferred to an immobilon
transfer membrane (millipore corp., bedford, ma)
for 16hr. the membrane was dried at 80°c for
30 min and was uv-irradiated to fix pcr products
tightly. pcr products on the membrane were prehybridized in 1 m naci, 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.6,
1% sds at 65°c for 1 hr and hybridized in the same
solution with the biotinylated random primed probes
synthesized from the entire cdna of er with plex
luminescent blotting kits for labeling (millipore
corp., bedford, ma) at 65°c for 16hr. specific
bands with the biotinylated probes were detected with
plex luminescent kits (millipore corp., bedford,
ma) and the membrane was exposed to x-ray film at
room temperature for 10min. the quantification
of southern blot was carried out with bio image
(millipore, ann arbor, mi, u.s.a.).

analysis of transcription rate of er gene to er mrna
(run on assay)
peripheral monocytes (10 7 cells) were resuspended
in 5 ml tr buffer (10 mm tris-hcl, pi-i 8.0, 10 mm
naci, 6 m m mgci2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (dtt),
0.2% triton x-100) and mixed gently to collect the
intact nuclei. the nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 180g for 5 min. rna chains were generated
by incubation in 50 mm tris-hc1, ph 8.0, 100 mm
kci, 12.5% glycerol, 6 m m mgci 2, l mm mnc12,
0.1 mm edta, 2 m m dtt, 150u/ml rnasin,
2 mm atp, 1 mm ctp, 1 mm gtp, 1 # m biotinylated utp at room temperature for 30 min. the
reaction mixture was treated with rnaase-free
dnaase, extracted with phenol-chloroformisoamylalcohol, precipitated with ethanol and then
digested again with dnaase, re-extracted and reprecipitated. labeled rna was hybridized to l #g
er cdna immobilized on immobilon transfer membranes. hybridizations were performed overnight at
42°c in buffer containing 750 mm  xxxg2020xxx , 50 mm na
phosphate, ph 7.0, 5mm edta, 5 x denhardt's
reagent, 50 #g/ml salmon sperm dna, 10% dextran
sulfate and 50% formamide. final washes were
performed with 3 mm nacl, 2 mm na phosphate,
ph 7.0, and 0.2mm edta at 65°c. specific dots
annealed with biotinylated er rna were detected
with plex luminescent kits and the membranes were
exposed to x-ray film at room temperature for
15 min. the quantification of dot blot in run on assay
was carried out with bio image (millipore, ann
arbor, mi, u.s.a.).
statistical analysis was performed with student's
t-test; differences were considered significant, when p
is less than 0.05.

analysis of degradation rate of er mrna
after isolation of peripheral blood monocytes as
adherent ceils on the petri dish in eagle's mem
medium,  xxxd1800xxx  (5 #g/ml) was added to stop
the transcription of all genes. the monocytes were
harvested at various time points, to isolate total
rna. er m r n a levels were determined with
rt-pcr-southern blotting. each half life of er
m r n a was analyzed with the residual m r n a levels.

wild type er crna were amplified with the linearity to au of total volume density•

18.9 ___2.51 pg//ag total rna (46.7 + 6.2%), respectively (fig. 5a). the er mrna level in the monocytes were highest in ep of the menstrual cycle. the
er mrna level in monocytes from the danazoltreated patients (n = 4) was 8.44_+ 1.22 pg/#g total
rna (fig. 5a).  xxxd1806xxx  in vivo reduced significantly
( p <0.05) the er mrna level in monocytes to
20.8 + 3.0% of that in ep.
the mean ( _+sd) er mrna level in mononuclear
cells in ep (n = 2), lp (n = 2) and s (n = 2 ) was
3.50+ 1.17 (8.6_2.9%), 1.61 _+0.23 (4.0_+0.6%)
and 2.78_+ 0.43 pg/pg total rna (6.9_+ 1.2%),
respectively, while the er mrna expression in
mononuclear cells (fig. 5b) was lower ( p < 0.05)
than that in monocytes.

analysis o f degradation rate o f er mrna (fig. 6)
the half life of er mrna in monocytes without
or with exposure of 1 pm  xxxd1806xxx  for 8 hr was !1.0
or 11.6 hr, respectively. the half life of  xxxg861xxx 

mrna in monocytes with and without exposure of
 xxxd1806xxx  was approximately 50 hr. data represent the
mean ( _ sd) of duplicate determinations from three
experiments. this suggests that  xxxd1806xxx  does not
affect the degradation rate of er mrna or  xxxg861xxx 
mrna, namely their stability.

analysis o f transcription rate o f er gene to er mrna
(run on assay) (fig. 7)
the amount of generated er and  xxxg861xxx  mrna
in vitro was analyzed by the hybridization to er
edna and  xxxg861xxx  dna fragment amplified by
pcr fixed on a nylon membrane (fig. 7a). each
value represents the mean (__+sd) of triplicate determinations from two experiments.  xxxd1806xxx  did not
decrease the transcription rate of  xxxg861xxx  gene to
 xxxg861xxx  mrna, but decreased that of er gene to
er mrna significantly ( p < 0.05) to 47.2_ 3.3%
(fig. 7b).

fig. 7. effect of  xxxd1806xxx  on the rate of transcription of er gene. monocytes were incubated without and
with 1 #m  xxxd1806xxx  for 8 hr, until nuclei were isolated. the rate of er and  xxxg861xxx  genes transcription
was measured by a run-on assay, as described in materials and methods. data represent the mean + sd

discussion
complete isolation of monocytes from peripheral
blood is difficult. the esterase stain showed that the
monoeytes are isolated as adherent cells with contamination by less than 5% impurities from mononuclear cells, and the monocyte specimen included a
few of other mononuclear cells (data not shown). the
mean kd of er in the mononuclear cells was similar
to that in the monocyte specimens. the er and er
m r n a levels in mononuclear cells were markedly
lower than those in monocyte specimen. these
findings suggested that the other mononuclear cells
express few er mrna. we can ignore the small
number of other mononuclear cells in the monocyte
specimen, when discussing about the expression of
er and er mrna in monocytes.

the expression level of er mrna in monocytes
was the highest in ep of the menstrual cycle, and that
of er in monocytes was the highest in lp of the
menstrual cycle. there was a time lag of the peak
between the level of er mrna and er. the expressions of these two in monocytes seem to be
regulated in estrogen predominance. the time lag of
the expressions may be explained as time lag between
the translation of er mrna and the accumulation
of er protein. the expression levels of er mrna
and er decreased during the secretory phase. there
is a plausible explanation that progesterone reduces
the expression, as one of its biological functions,
resulting in the inhibition of cellular proliferation
(antiestrogen effect).  xxxd1806xxx  exerts an antiestrogenic
effect which is known from the clinical evidence
obtained in the treatment of endometriosis and from

decrease of er gene transcription
the experimental evidence (dmoeski, 1979).  xxxd1806xxx 
neither modulates the kds of er, nor inhibits
markedly [3h]-e2 binding to the cytosol fraction in
monocytes. therefore  xxxd1806xxx  is not considered to
have an effect on the quality of er in monocytes.
 xxxd1806xxx  lowers the er level in the uterus (tamaya
et al., 1991). its mechanism has been clarified yet, and
is considered to be derived partly from the interaction
of  xxxd1806xxx  to the regulation of sex steroid binding
sites (tamaya et al., 1984).
the long-term downregulation of hormone receptors, in partly, involves the downregulation of its
mrna, namely the degradation of its mrna by
the hormone homologous and/or heterologous to
the receptor (fujimoto et al., 1991; fujimoto and
gershengorn, 1991). therefore the degradation rate
of er mrna by  xxxd1806xxx  was determined. the half
life of er mrna in monocytes after the exposure of
l pm  xxxd1806xxx  for 8 hr (11.0 hr) was similar to that
without the treatment (11.6 hr). these findings indicate that  xxxd1806xxx  does not affect the degradation rate
of er mrna in monocytes, that it downregulates
the er level in monocytes.  xxxd1806xxx  decreased the
transcription rate of the er gene to er mrna to
approximately 47.2%. in addition, serum estradiol,
progesterone and testosterone levels before/after
 xxxd1806xxx  administration were 54.1 + 13.6 pg/ml/
47.8 _+ 14.7 pg/ml, 0.82 + 0.33 ng/ml/0.77 _ 0.22 ng/
ml, and 0.62 + 0.35 ng/ml/0.70 + 0.42 ng/ml, respectively by coat-a-count radio-immunoassay kits
(nippon dpc corp., tokyo, japan). therefore,
 xxxd1806xxx  is considered to release estrogen responsiveness in monocytes, at least in part, via the reduction
of transcription of the er gene to er mrna, and
reduction of er level in monocytes, regardless of
altering serum steroid hormone levels. these findings
suggest that  xxxd1806xxx  exerts effects on monocytes/
macrophages, such as the reduction of er level and
estrogen effect, resulting in the reduced production of
cytokines, il-i and/or tnf.

conclusions
monocytes from peripheral blood in the menstrual
cycle express high affinity estrogen binding sites
( xxxg730xxx , er). the dissociation constant
(kd) of er in monocytes was approximately 3.5 nm,
and the er concentration in monocytes was highest
in the late proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle.
the er mrna level in monocytes in the early
proliferative phase was highest during the menstrual
cycle. er mrna and er expressions seem to be
regulated by estrogen predominance, and the time
necessary for the translation and accumulation of er

515

proteins may cause this time lag between er mrna
and er peaks.
administration of  xxxd1806xxx  for over one month did
not alter the kd of er, in monocytes, but reduced the
er level to approximately 50% in the monocytes. it
also reduced the er mrna level in monocytes to
approximately 20%. the half lives of er mrna in
monocytes without treatment and after the exposure
of 1/tm  xxxd1806xxx  for 8hr were l l . 6 h r and l l . 0 h r ,
respectively.  xxxd1806xxx  was not considered to affect the
degradation rate of er mrna.  xxxd1806xxx  decreased
the transcription rate of er gene to er mrna to
approximately 50% in a run-on assay.
in conclusion,  xxxd1806xxx  may release estrogen predominance in monocytes via the reduction of transcription for er gene, which leads to the reduction
of er mrna and er expressions in monocytes,
resulting in the decrease of estrogen-induced biological functions.
