abstract: benzodiazepines are currently among the most frequently prescribed drugs all over the world. they act as anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics, amnesics, antiepileptics and muscle relaxants. despite their common chemical scaffold, these drugs differ in their pharmacokinetic and metabolic properties. in particular, they are biotransformed by different cytochrome p450 isoforms and also by different
udp-glucuronosyltransferase subtypes. the most important studies on the metabolic characteristics of several 1,4-benzodiazepines, carried out from 1998 onwards, are reported and briefly discussed in this review. moreover, the analytical methods related to these studies
are also described and commented upon and their most important characteristics are highlighted. most methods are based on liquid chromatography, which provides wide applicability and good analytical performance granting high precision, accuracy and feasibility. mass
spectrometry is gaining widespread acceptance, particularly if the matrix is very complex and variable, such as human or animal blood.
however, spectrophotometric detection is still used for this purpose and can grant sufficient selectivity and sensitivity when coupled to
suitable sample pre-treatment procedures.
a monograph is included for each of the following benzodiazepines: alprazolam,  xxxd369xxx , brotizolam,  xxxd1731xxx , diazepam, etizolam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, oxazepam and triazolam.

introduction
benzodiazepines (bzds) are among the most frequently prescribed drugs due to their anxiolytic, hypnotic, sedative, amnesic,
antiepileptic and muscle relaxant properties [1]. they are also much
safer than the older barbiturates in case of overdose [2]. most bzds
share the 5-phenyl-1,3-dihydrobenzo[e][1,4]diazepine nucleus, with
different possible substitutents on the 1, 2, 3, 7 and 2’ positions;
some (such as  xxxd1718xxx , arfendazam and lofendazam) are based on
the 5-phenyl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,5]diazepine nucleus instead,
while others have different aromatic rings fused to the diazepine
ring: e.g.,  xxxd1731xxx  is a thiophenediazepine. bzds are usually
divided into three groups according to their duration of action: less
than 12h for short-acting bzds, 12-24 h for intermediate-acting
bzds and more than 24 h for long-acting bzds [3]. it should be
noted that the different durations of action of the various bzds are
mainly due to the presence of one or more metabolites with notable
pharmacological activity. some of these metabolites (oxazepam,
lorazepam, nordazepam) are commercialised as drugs on their own.
short-acting bzds are usually prescribed for the treatment of insomnia and related sleep disturbances, since they allow the patient
to sleep rapidly and cause limited somnolence the following morning. on the contrary, intermediate- and long-acting bzds are usually prescribed for anxiety-related disorders, to keep the symptoms
under control with a single daily dose or even less frequent administration [4].
 xxxd1459xxx  metabolism involves two main pathways: oxidation and
glucuronidation. usually, those bzds which first undergo oxidation, mainly by action of cytochrome p450 (cyp), generate active
metabolites which have then to be glucuronidated in order to be
excreted, thus their duration of action can be very long. on the
contrary, direct glucuronidation of the drug produces inactive, rapidly excreted metabolites; those bzds that are mainly glucuronidated generally have a short duration of action [5].
despite having first been introduced onto the market almost
fifty years ago, bzds are still considered the most safe and efficacious anxiolytic-hypnotics currently available. their use is ex*address correspondence to this author at the department of pharmaceutical sciences, via belmeloro 6, i-40126 bologna, italy; tel. +39 051

tremely widespread and they are also often prescribed as adjuvants
during antidepressant and antipsychotic therapies [6,8]. most bzds
have been available for more than twenty years, thus their pharmacokinetic and metabolic characteristics are generally very well
known. however, this is not to say that these topics are not studied
anymore. on the contrary, in the last few years several advances
have been made in the knowledge of, e.g., the specific enzymes or
enzyme subtypes involved in their metabolism, or the pharmacological interactions with other drugs. in this paper, the most relevant
studies published in the last ten years (i.e., since 1998) on  xxxd1459xxx 
metabolism and interactions will be reviewed. the analytical methods used in these studies for the determination of bzds and their
metabolites in biological matrices will also be described in detail
and commented upon. this can be a useful support in evaluating the
exact analytical needs of the study and the most suitable techniques
and procedures to obtain reliable and complete data.
a bibliographic search has been carried out, regarding the most
frequently used 1,4-bzds: alprazolam,  xxxd369xxx , chlordiazepoxide,  xxxd1731xxx , delorazepam, diazepam, etizolam, lorazepam, oxazepam and  xxxd2999xxx  among those mainly used as anxiolytics; brotizolam, flunitrazepam,  xxxd2140xxx , lormetazepam,
midazolam, nordazepam, temazepam and triazolam among those
mainly used as hypnotics.
of these, however, chlordiazepoxide, delorazepam,  xxxd2140xxx ,
lormetazepam, nordazepam,  xxxd2999xxx  and temazepam are not included as monographs. in fact, it has been found that very few scientific papers (or none at all) have been published in the last ten
years dealing with the metabolism of these compounds, despite
their relatively frequent use in some countries. nordazepam and
temazepam are two important diazepam metabolites, thus they are
often included in studies regarding the parent drug. for this reason,
they will be briefly cited in this role in the diazepam monograph.
anxiolytic benzodiazepines
alprazolam
alprazolam
(8-chloro-1-methyl-6-phenyl-4h-[1,2,4]triazolo
[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine) is an intermediate-acting triazolobenzodiazepine mainly known as xanax, or alpravecs, alprazig,
frontal,  xxxd122xxx  and  xxxd122xxx . an extended-release form is available as  xxxd122xxx . its main therapeutic uses include the treatment

of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, and the short-term
treatment of severe acute anxiety [9]. doses are usually 0.25-0.5 mg
three times a day, with a total maximum of 3 mg.
metabolism and pharmacokinetics
alprazolam is well absorbed after oral administration [10];
however, when it is administered as an orally disintegrating tablet,
the presence of food can delay the time needed to reach maximum
blood concentration (tmax) by 1.5 hours and lower the maximum
plasma concentration (c max) by 25%. no significant effect on the
area under the time - blood concentration curve (auc) has been
found and thus, presumably, on clinical efficacy [11]. age does not
seem to have a significant effect on the main pharmacokinetic parameters of alprazolam, such as half-life (t1/2), tmax, cmax, distribution volume (vd) and apparent clearance [12]. it is well known that
alprazolam is a substrate of cytochrome p450 (cyp) subtype 3a4
[13]. the main phase i metabolite thus formed is 4-hydroxyalprazolam, while -hydroxyalprazolam is formed by the action of
 xxxg592xxx  [14, 15] (fig. 1). however, it has been found that constant
ingestion of grapefruit juice (an inhibitor of cyp3a4) does not
cause any change in the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic
properties of alprazolam; this has been attributed to its high
bioavailability [16]. some recent studies suggest that  xxxg592xxx 
genetic polymorphism affects the disposition of alprazolam and
provides a plausible explanation for interindividual variation in
the disposition of this drug [17]. however, these results are stil l
a matter for discussion [18, 19]. alprazolam has been suggested
as a possible probe for  xxxg590xxx  phenotyping; plasma concentration
ratios obtained between 1 h and 48 h after administration correlated
significantly to the corresponding auc(0-) ratios for both alprazolam/4-hydroxyalprazolam and alprazolam/-hydroxyalprazolam
[20].

fig. (1). main metabolic pathways of alprazolam.

after i.v. administration, the plasma levels of alprazolam decay
biexponentially; after oral dosing, instead, a double peak has been
observed in the time-concentration curve, for both the parent drug
and the two hydroxylated metabolites [21]. a possible explanation

mandrioli et al.

for this fact is a reduction in gastric motility due to the muscle relaxant effect of the drug [21].
several papers have been published in the last ten years, regarding possible pharmacological interactions between alprazolam and
other drugs. alprazolam therapy can increase the oral bioavailability of lithium carbonate in bipolar patients with generalised anxiety;
this is probably due to a decrease in gastro-intestinal symptoms
[22]. interactions between alprazolam and antidepressants have
been particularly studied, due to the high frequency of coadministration, and most second-generation antidepressants, such as
ssris (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), have been tested for
this purpose. no interaction has been found between alprazolam
and the ssris paroxetine [23] and sertraline [24] in healthy volunteers. fluoxetine, an ssri antidepressant and an inhibitor of
cyp3a4, prolongs by 16% the half-life and increases by 32% the
auc of alprazolam [23]. the ssri fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of
cyp2c19 and 3a4, caused very evident increases (up to 100% and
more) in alprazolam plasma concentrations; very high interindividual variations were found, probably related to different
cyp2c19 genotypes [25]. the snri (serotonin and norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor) antidepressant venlafaxine has been found to
lower the auc of alprazolam by about 30% and to increase the
drug clearance in healthy volunteers, however the clinical consequences of this fact seem to be unclear [26]. a low- xxxd2307xxx  st.
john’s wort extract (used as an antidepressant as well) showed no
influence on alprazolam plasma levels; since  xxxd2307xxx  is a
cyp3a4 inducer, the lack of interaction could be attributed to the
low content of this active principle [27].
analytical methods
most analytical methods used in the last few years for the determination of alprazolam and its main metabolites in human
plasma for pharmacokinetic purposes are based on highperformance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (usually tandem mass - ms/ms - for added selectivity) [11, 2830]. this technique has the advantages of very high selectivity, high
sensitivity (lower limit of quantification: 40-100 pg/ml, depending
on the analyte) and short run times (typically less than five minutes
for one chromatographic run); only precision is not completely
satisfactory (cv < 20%). the sample pre-treatment based on liquidliquid extraction (lle) [28, 29] significantly increases the total
analysis time (it requires agitation, centrifugation, phase separation,
drying and redissolution). an aliquot of 500 il of plasma is sufficient for one analysis and the analytes are concentrated 2.5 times
during the pre-treatment procedure. on the contrary, the solid-phase
extraction (spe) procedure [30] on hydrophilic-lipophilic balance
(hlb) cartridges requires 1 ml of plasma and concentrates the
analytes 20 times before the injection. the double peak in alprazolam time-concentration curve after oral administration was observed using an analytical method published some years before
[31], which is based on hplc with uv detection at 230 nm. simple lle is used as a sample pre-treatment and sensitivity is lower
that that of hplc-ms methods (loq = 5 ng/ml), as one can expect.
the interaction studies typically analyse alprazolam only, not
the metabolites; the analytical method for the alprazolamparoxetine study [23] is based on hplc-ms/ms after liquid-liquid
extraction; although the authors claim that the method had been
validated, no reference to a complete analytical paper is reported
and only limited details on method performance (loq = 100
pg/ml) are reported. the method used for the venlafaxinealprazolam study [26] is based on hplc-ms/ms as well, however
it allows analysing the two main metabolites and the paper reports a
loq of 100 pg/ml, rsd values lower than or equal to 6.8% and
accuracy in the 93-117% range. the methods used in the alprazolam-fluoxetine and in the alprazolam-fluvoxamine studies, on the
contrary, are based on hplc-uv [25, 32], with limits of detection

benzodiazepine metabolism

of 0.6-0.8 ng/ml, thus significantly higher than those of hplc-ms
methods.
other benzodiazepines, such as midazolam, etizolam and triazolam,
have been used as the internal standards (iss) of these analytical
methods. obviously, this does not pose any particular problem for
pharmacokinetics and interaction studies, where drug administration is tightly controlled, but could potentially cause analytical interference if the methods are used for other purposes, such as therapeutic drug monitoring (tdm).
 xxxd369xxx 
 xxxd369xxx 
(7-bromo-1,3-dihydro-5-(2-pyridinyl)-2h-1,4benzodiazepin-2-one) is known as brixopan,  xxxd369xxx , compendium, creosedin,  xxxd369xxx ,  xxxd369xxx ,  xxxd369xxx ,  xxxd369xxx ,
 xxxd369xxx , lexotan,  xxxd369xxx ,  xxxd369xxx , novepam,  xxxd369xxx  or
lexatin. it is a pyridinylbenzodiazepine mainly used as an anxiolytic, however it possesses strong sleep-inducing properties and is
also used (in association with an antimuscarinic agent) for gastrointestinal spasms and enuresis [33]. usual doses are 1.5-12 mg
three times per day, with a maximum daily dose of 120 mg.
metabolism and pharmacokinetics
only a few papers have been recently published dealing with
topics related to the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd369xxx . a study has
found that rectal administration of  xxxd369xxx  increases the drug
auc by 70% and its cmax by 60% with respect to oral administration [34]. the authors suppose that this effect is due to a lack of
degradation of  xxxd369xxx  by this route. the drug metabolism
presumably involves cytochrome p450, since it is inhibited by fluvoxamine [35], however the specific subtype has not been clearly
identified. in fact, fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of cyp1a2, a
less potent cyp3a4, 2c9 and 2c19 inhibitor, and a negligible inhibitor of cyp2d6. however, cyp3a4 probably is not the responsible enzyme, since itraconazole does not affect  xxxd369xxx 
plasma concentrations [36]. the main phase i metabolite of  xxxd369xxx  is 3-hydroxybromazepam (fig. 2), which is pharmacologically active and whose half-life is approximately equal to that
of  xxxd369xxx  (about 17 hours) [37].
recently, a paper has been published on the urinary metabolites
of  xxxd369xxx  in four different species (human, dog, rat and
mouse) [38]. the most abundant urinary metabolite in humans is 3hydroxybromazepam glucuronide, followed by 2-(2-amino-5bromo-3-hydroxybenzoyl)pyridine and 2-(2-amino-5-bromobenzoyl)pyridine.
a prolonged release formulation of  xxxd369xxx  has been developed and it has been found bioequivalent to normal capsules in
one study [39] on 24 healthy volunteers.
in recent years, azole antifungals have been the main subjects
of interaction studies with  xxxd369xxx . as already said, itraconazole administration does not seem to have any effect on  xxxd369xxx  pharmacokinetics [36]. similar results have been obtained with
fluconazole [34].
it has been also observed that  xxxd369xxx  does not impair the
uptake of iron from fe(oh)3 polymaltose complexes used as a
source of soluble, non-ionic iron [40].
analytical methods
the analytical method used to determine  xxxd369xxx  plasma
levels in the fluconazole study [34] is a slight modification of a
previously published method [41] and is based on hplc with uv
detection at 240 nm. plasma pre-treatment is carried out by liquidsolid extraction with dichloromethane on a diatomaceous earth
column. while sensitivity (loq = 1 ng/ml) and precision (rsd <
8%) appear to be satisfactory, run times are very long (more than 40
minutes). this could be understandable for the original method,
which analysed the main metabolites in urine as well, however it is
a major drawback for the analysis of only one compound. the itra-

conazole- xxxd369xxx  study [35] was carried out using a further
modification of the same method, with a double solvent extraction
and slightly lower sensitivity (loq = 2 ng/ml); the mobile phase
modification was presumably made to decrease the retention times
of the analyte and the is (alprazolam).

fig. (2). main metabolic pathways of  xxxd369xxx .

as a comparison, some methods based on hplc-ms have been
published in the last few years, specifically developed for pharmacokinetic studies [42]. one of these deals with the choice of the
most suitable ion source (esi or api) and analyser (triple quadrupole or ion trap) [42]. while the two sources were substantially
equivalent, higher sensitivity was obtained with the triple quadrupole analyser. in this case, sensitivity is similar to that of uv
detection (loq = 2.5 ng/ml), but run times are many times shorter,
i.e., about 2 minutes. sample pre-treatment is carried out by protein
precipitation with acetonitrile. another paper proposes the use of
hplc-ms/ms preceded by on-line spe [43]: this allows the automated pre-treatment and analysis of the biological samples for
pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence purposes in about 3 minutes.
the cartridge sorbent is a c18 resin and 100 l of sample are sufficient for one analysis. another paper describes a method based on
hplc-ms/ms for bioequivalence studies [44]. it reports the use of
lle for the sample pre-treatment, a run time of 2.5 min and a loq
of 1 ng/ml.
for  xxxd369xxx , again, most methods use other benzodiazepines, such as nitrazepam, lorazepam or alprazolam, as the iss.
 xxxd1731xxx 
 xxxd1731xxx  (5-(2-chlorophenyl)-7-ethyl-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl2h-thieno[2,3-e]-1,4- xxxd1866xxx -2-one) is commercially known as

830 current drug metabolism, 2008, vol. 9, no. 8

 xxxd1731xxx ,  xxxd1731xxx  or  xxxd1731xxx . usual daily doses for the control of
anxiety range from 5 to 30 mg.
only a few papers have been published on  xxxd1731xxx  metabolism and pharmacokinetics since the 1970-80s, when the original
pre-clinical and clinical studies were carried out on this drug.
the early studies on healthy volunteers established that the drug
is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. the two main metabolites are -hydroxyclotiazepam and n-desmethylclotiazepam (fig.
3), which appear and disappear approximately in parallel with the
parent compound. the mean elimination half-lives of  xxxd1731xxx ,
the hydroxy metabolite and the desmethyl metabolite are 6.5, 7.0
and 17.8 h, respectively [45]. the analytical technique used in this
study was gas-liquid chromatography (glc) with electron capture
detection. electron capture detector was used since it is selective
towards compounds containing very electronegative atoms and in
particular towards halogens. recently, an in vitro study has been
published on the contribution of different cyp isoforms to the metabolism of some psychotropic drugs (among which the benzodiazepines diazepam,  xxxd1731xxx ,  xxxd3391xxx  and etizolam) [46]. the
metabolism of  xxxd1731xxx  was catalyzed, in order of increasing
metabolic activity, by  xxxg583xxx , cyp3a4,  xxxg584xxx  and
cyp2c19. however, since cyp3a4 is more abundant than
 xxxg583xxx  in the human liver [47], the former seems to be the main
metabolising cytochrome of  xxxd1731xxx  [46]. in this paper, the
analytical method is based on gradient hplc with uv detection at
242 nm, however the biological matrix in this case is not a real
biological sample, but purified liver microsomes or recombinant
cytochromes. a typical chromatographic run lasts 12 minutes, diazepam is used as the is and the loq is about 15 ng/ml.

mandrioli et al.

the typical dose for anxiety is 6 mg/day in three administrations, but it can be increased up to 30 mg/day. the rectal administration is used for acute anxiety and agitation, at 500 fg/kg every
12 h until the symptoms are under control.
metabolism and pharmacokinetics
diazepam is primarily metabolized by hepatic enzymes, with
very little unchanged drug eliminated in the urine [48]. hepatic ndemethylation results in the formation of the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam (also known as nordazepam). this metabolite is
hydroxylated to form oxazepam, which is also active and is metabolised to form oxazepam glucuronide. a minor active metabolite is
temazepam, which can be in turn demethylated to oxazepam or
glucuronidated. the main active species found in blood are diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, because oxazepam and temazepam
are conjugated and excreted at almost the same rate as they are
generated [49]. another minor metabolic pathway in animals is 4’hydroxylation by cyp2d1 [50]. in rats, it has been observed that
cyp2d3 might be involved in diazepam 4’-hydroxylation, while
cyp2d1 and 2d2 practically do not participate in diazepam metabolism [51]. some authors have hypothesised that  xxxg583xxx  could
have a role in diazepam metabolism, since anti- xxxg583xxx  antibodies
inhibit diazepam disappearance in human hepatocytes [52]. more
detailed studies on human recombinant cytochromes have shown
that  xxxg583xxx  catalyses exclusively (and 2c8, 2c9, and 2c9r144c
preferentially) the n-demethylation of diazepam; cyp3a4 and 3a5
catalyse primarily its 3-hydroxylation (fig. 4) [53]. other, similar

diazepam
diazepam
(7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2h-1,4benzodiazepin-2-one) has been the second  xxxd1459xxx  ever introduced
onto the market (after chlordiazepoxide) and is still one of the most
widely used bzds in the whole world. it is used for the treatment
of anxiety, seizures and for preoperative anaesthesia induction. it is
generally known as valium, however it is also commercialised
under names such as  xxxd1866xxx ,  xxxd1866xxx ,  xxxd1866xxx ,  xxxd1866xxx  and
 xxxd122xxx .

fig. (4). main metabolic pathways of diazepam.

benzodiazepine metabolism

studies have indicated a 60-80% contribution of cyp3a4/5 to temazepam formation [54, 55]. nordazepam formation was inhibited
by antibodies for  xxxg583xxx  (6-23%), 2c (12-61%) and 3a4/5 (1445%). the antibodies for  xxxg575xxx , 1a2,  xxxd577xxx , 2d6, and  xxxd851xxx  did
not inhibit temazepam or nordazepam formation [55]. it has been
found that the genetic polymorphism of cyp2c19 can influence
diazepam [56, 57] and nordazepam [58] pharmacokinetics. however, there is a only maximum 2-fold difference in the hepatic
elimination rate or the auc between the extremes of extensive
metabolisers and poor metabolisers [59], thus no treatment guidelines for diazepam take pharmacogenetic data into account [60].
diazepam has a t1/2 of 20-50 h and nordazepam, the main active
form of its metabolites, has an even longer duration of action (up to
200 h); thus, caution should be taken for possible accumulation of
the drug or the metabolite. the t1/2 values of both compounds are
significantly longer in case of overdose, resulting in possible
drowsiness, dysarthria, diplopia and dizziness for more than one
week even after treatment with activated charcoal, diuretics and the
 xxxd1459xxx  antagonist flumazenil [61].
due to the complex metabolic profile of diazepam, several drug
interactions are possible during therapy. for example, chronic administration of the antiepileptic phenobarbital powerfully induces
cyp, thus notably decreasing diazepam auc, cmax and bioavailability and increasing its tmax [62]. on the other hand, grapefruit
juice (by way of intestinal cyp3a4 inhibition) [63],  xxxd3116xxx  (a
rifampicin analogue) [64] and isoniazid [65] can have the opposite
effect. omeprazole can inhibit the formation of the three main direct metabolites of diazepam (nordazepam, temazepam, 4’ xxxd3304xxx ) [66].
diazepam can be administered to treat status epilepticus and
other kinds of seizures. while the preferred route of administration
for this indication is rectal, it has been shown that diazepam is rapidly absorbed intranasally [67] and that it can easily reach therapeutic concentrations by this route [68].
since neonates have a reduced capacity of the hepatic biotransformation system, serum levels of diazepam and its metabolites can
be substantially elevated if this is not taken into account before i.v.
or oral administration. the very long-acting nordazepam in particular can cause persistent respiratory failure, muscular hypotonia and
drowsiness [69].
diazepam and its metabolite oxazepam are carcinogens in mice
but not in rats. they have also been shown to induce both  xxxg583xxx 
and cyp4a in mice and only  xxxg583xxx  in rats; thus, it has been hypothesised that the carcinogenic effect is related to  xxxg583xxx  activation, however the reason of the species-specific cyp induction is
still unclear [70].
analytical methods
analysis of diazepam, temazepam, nordazepam and 4’ xxxd3304xxx  for metabolism studies was carried out on rat
microsomes by hplc-uv at 230 nm [50, 51]. a simple pretreatment by lle with ethyl acetate is carried out. the analytes and
the is (nitrazepam) are separated on a c18 column using an acidic
phosphate buffer / acetonitrile / methanol mixture as the mobile
phase. unfortunately, run times are long (more than 35 min) and no
other detail of the method is reported in the paper.
the in vivo assay of diazepam and nordazepam in human
plasma for cyp2c19 activity [58] was carried out by gc with nitrogen-phosphorus detection, which is specific for compounds containing these heteroatoms. the sample pre-treatment consists of an
lle procedure with  xxxd2052xxx ; analyte separation is achieved
using a capillary column coated with 50% dimethyl - 50% diphenyl
polysiloxane. according to the authors’ report, precision cvs were
always lower than 10% and the loq was 8 ng/ml for both analytes. in this case, the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine is used
as the is instead of another  xxxd1459xxx .

another study on the effect of cyp2c19 polymorphism [59]
exploited a previously published analytical method for the
simultaneous analysis of eleven bzds by hplc-uv at 254 nm
[71]. it is not clear whether any changes were made to the original
method, since the choice appears quite peculiar: in fact, in the cited
paper diazepam was used as the is, thus the method was not
validated for this analyte (i.e., no linearity range or precision values
were obtained for it). moreover, the retention time for diazepam
was more than 26 minutes; while this is acceptable for a multianalyte method, it is decidedly too long for a single analyte, as in
this interestingly,
case.
the study on pharmacokinetics interactions between phenobarbital and diazepam [62] was carried out on dog
serum by means of a fluorescence polarisation immunoassay
(fpia), the tdx benzodiazepines serum assay. since the assay
has an almost complete cross-reactivity between diazepam, nordazepam and oxazepam [72], it was intentionally used to obtain the
total “active moiety” in serum.
the two analytical methods used to analyse diazepam and three
metabolites (temazepam, nordazepam and 4’ xxxd3304xxx ) in
the omeprazole-diazepam interaction study [66] are based on
hplc-uv and on hplc-ms/ms. the hplc-uv [73] method
uses a c18 column and a mobile phase composed of methanol and
water; a chromatographic run lasts about 25 min. the detection
wavelength is 254 nm. the assay is carried out on rat microsomes
or hepatocytes after incubation and lle with ethyl acetate. this
method was found not selective enough for the analyses on hepatocytes, thus hplc-ms/ms (esi and triple quadrupole analyser) was
used for the latter. unfortunately, the only analytical information
available on this method are the mass transitions employed and the
is (triazolam).
diazepam absorption after intranasal administration [67] was
determined by a radiochemical method, administering 2-14cdiazepam to rats and measuring the radioactivity of blood samples
drawn from two different parts of a carotid artery (one closer to the
brain and the other closer to the heart). of course, this method cannot discriminate between diazepam and its metabolites. however,
the assay was carried out to assess diazepam transfer from the nasal
cavity to the brain arterial blood, thus biotransformation was not
considered.
etizolam
etizolam (4-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-ethyl-9-methyl-6h-thieno[3,2f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]diazepine) is marketed under the names
sedekopan, depas and pasaden. it is a thienotriazolodiazepine,
which, according to the manufacturer, is rapidly metabolised and
incurs lower risks of accumulation with respect to other bzds [74].
the usual doses for anxiety are 0.25-0.50 mg two or three times per
day, for insomnia 1 or 2 mg before bedtime.
metabolism and pharmacokinetics
in humans, etizolam tmax is about 3.2 h, and t1/2 is about 6.2 h.
so, it can be classified as a short-medium acting  xxxd1459xxx . a recently
published study has reported that the main cytochrome isoform
responsible for etizolam hepatic metabolism is cyp3a4, with minor contributions from  xxxg584xxx  and 2c19 [46] (fig. 5). in fact,
cyp3a4 showed the fastest enzymatic rate and furthermore ketoconazole, a well-known inhibitor of cyp3a4, strongly inhibited
etizolam metabolism [75]. itraconazole, another selective cyp3a4
inhibitor, had similar effects [76]. however, the contribution of
cyp2c19 can be significant. it has been observed that the single
dose pharmacokinetics of etizolam are strongly influenced by mutations (cyp2c19*2 and cyp2c19*3) causing the complete loss of
cyp2c19 activity, with larger auc and longer elimination t1/2 and
corresponding prolongation of the pharmacological effect [77].
conversely, the cyp3a4 inducer carbamazepine [78] significantly
decreases the c max, t1/2 and auc values of etizolam in healthy volunteers [79].

832 current drug metabolism, 2008, vol. 9, no. 8

recently, some studies have been carried out on possible interactions between traditional japanese kampo drugs and benzodiazepines [80]. in particular, a study regards the simultaneous administration of etizolam and two herbal preparations used to treat
menopausal symptoms: kamisyoyosan, used for agitated patients,
and tokisyakuyakusan, used for menoxenia and oedema. etizolam
is often prescribed together with this kind of herbal remedy to ease
the anxious symptoms associated with menopause. both herbal
preparations are decoctions of 6-10 different plants, such as angelica, paeonia, glycyrrhiza and menthae; they can interact with
cyp3a4 inhibiting it, although with lower potency with respect to
grapefruit juice [80]. the results of the study suggest that, at normal
doses, no inhibition of cyp3a4 occurs; however, an overdose of
tokisyakuyakusan (i.e. at least 20 times the normal dose) could
influence, at least in theory, the pharmacokinetics of etizolam.

mandrioli et al.

plasma were needed for one analysis. unfortunately, no other detail
is reported on the performance of the analytical method, apart for a
mean etizolam extraction yield corresponding to 97%. the is used
for most studies [46, 80] was diazepam.
lorazepam
lorazepam
( xxxd2505xxx ) is an intermediate-acting  xxxd1459xxx 
with potent anxiolytic effects. its relatively potent amnesic effect,
together with its anxiolytic and sedative properties, makes lorazepam also useful as a premedication before a general anaesthetic
[82]. it is marketed as ativan,  xxxd2505xxx , control, lorans, slipirem,
tavor,  xxxd2505xxx  and zelirem. it is also one of the main metabolites
of lormetazepam.
the usual dose is 1-4 mg/day for anxiety and 1-2 mg before
going to bed for insomnia with anxiety. it can also be injected intramuscularly (25-30 g/kg) to treat acute and severe panic attacks.
metabolism and pharmacokinetics
lorazepam is poorly soluble in water and lipids, binds strongly
to plasma proteins and its metabolism is non-oxidative, with the
formation of a pharmacologically inactive 3-o-glucuronide [83].
udp-glucuronosyltransferase (ugt) 2b15 genetic polymorphisms
have been found to influence the clearance of lorazepam, however
the effect did not notably change when ugt2b15 was induced with
rifampicin or inhibited with  xxxd3485xxx  [84] (fig. 6). from experiments on rabbit microsomes, it has been found that azole antifungals (fluconazole,  xxxd2640xxx , and ketoconazole) can competitively inhibit ugt as well as cyp enzymes, thus lorazepam metabolism can be significantly impaired by the simultaneous administration of these drugs [85].

fig. (5). main metabolic pathways of etizolam.

analytical methods
the study on the cyp isoform responsible for etizolam metabolism [46] was carried out by hplc-uv, using a c18 column and a
sample pre-treatment by lle with ethyl acetate. an analytical run
lasts about 12 minutes and the loq value is approximately 7
ng/ml. the sensitivity is not outstanding, however this method was
only used for the in vitro evaluation of etizolam disappearance in a
microsomal preparation.
the method for etizolam determination in plasma samples, used
to assess the influence of either cyp2c19 mutations [77] or
cyp3a4 inhibition [79], is based on hplc-uv with column
switching. in this method [81], the sample pre-treatment was carried out online on a short column with a c18 sorbent coated with
albumin; the analyte is then switched to the c18 analytical column.
the reported extraction yield (near 100%) and loq (0.6 ng/ml)
values are very good for an hplc-uv method applied to such a
complex matrix as plasma.
the study of the interactions between etizolam and japanese
traditional drugs [80] was carried out by hplc-ms with a single
quadrupole detector and apci interface. sample pre-treatment was
carried out by protein precipitation with acetone and 50 l of

fig. (6). main metabolic pathways of lorazepam.

pregnancy changes the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam, with an
increase in the apparent distribution volume, an increase in apparent
oral clearance and a reduction of elimination t1/2. the increase in
oral clearance may indicate an increase in glucuronidation capacity,
with a possible reduction in the plasma drug concentrations [86].
the t1/2 of lorazepam is 8-25 hours [83], thus it is usually prescribed as one or two daily doses when taken regularly. drug peak
effects roughly coincide with peak serum levels [87], which occur

benzodiazepine metabolism

up to one hour after intramuscular injection and about 120 minutes
after oral administration. however, it has been observed that
lorazepam can sometimes be detected in the blood of elderly patients (in a nursing home environment) for as long as six weeks
after discontinuation [88]. in the same study, no clear correlation
between daily dosage and plasma levels was found and this was
attributed to wide interindividual variability in the drug elimination.
due to its poor solubility, injectable formulations of lorazepam
often contain a glycol (normally  xxxd3034xxx ) as a solvent.
this, however, can cause an accumulation of glycol in the body,
causing hyperosmolar metabolic acidosis with potentially dangerous effects such as renal dysfunction, intravascular haemolysis,
cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and central nervous system depression. a study has found that glycol accumulation can be observed
after at least 48 h of continuous infusion, and that it is directly related to the infusion rate [89]. this kind of toxicity was also observed in patients subjected to venovenous haemofiltration [90],
which is also insufficient to remove lorazepam from blood (but
eliminates the glucuronidated metabolite) [91].
analytical methods
quantitative determinations of lorazepam and its metabolite
during pregnancy [86] were carried out by hplc-ms/ms. the
method can be applied to both plasma and urine and has a loq of
0.2 ng/ml; the sample pre-treatment procedure is based on lle
with tert-butyl ether and needs 1 ml of sample for one analysis.
the metabolite is quantified as the difference between total and
non-glucuronidated lorazepam, after hydrolysis with -glucuronidase [92]. nitrazepam is used as the is.
for the study regarding the persistence of lorazepam in blood
after discontinuation [88], no analytical details were given, except
that the determination was based on hplc and that the loq was 5
ng/ml.
oxazepam
oxazepam (7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-5-phenyl-2h-1,4benzodiazepin-2-one) is marketed under the names  xxxd2808xxx ,  xxxd2808xxx ,  xxxd2808xxx ,  xxxd2808xxx ,  xxxd2808xxx ,  xxxd2808xxx ,  xxxd2808xxx ,  xxxd2808xxx  and  xxxd2808xxx . it is used to relieve the symptoms of anxiety and of alcohol
withdrawal at daily doses of 45-120 mg, divided into 3-4 administrations.
oxazepam is also a metabolite of other bzds, such as diazepam, nordazepam, chlordiazepoxide and  xxxd2999xxx . it is listed by
the iarc as a possible carcinogen (group 2b) [93].
metabolism and pharmacokinetics
since oxazepam is one of the main metabolites of diazepam,
which is much more widespread in use, the former is usually mostly
included in scientific studies regarding the latter.
oxazepam is an intermediate-acting  xxxd1459xxx , with a t1/2 of 5-14 h.
like lorazepam, it is mainly metabolised by 3-o-glucuronidation
[83], thus it is less likely to accumulate and to cause adverse effects
in the elderly than other bzds, which require hepatic oxidation.
oxazepam is formulated as a racemic preparation of (s)- and (r)stereoisomers, although the (s)-enantiomer is thought to be much
more active as a benzodiazepine receptor agonist compared with the
(r)-enantiomer [94]. (s)-oxazepam, but not (r)-oxazepam, has been
shown to be polymorphically glucuronidated in humans [95]. further studies have found that (s)-oxazepam is almost exclusively
metabolised by the ugt2b15 isoform, while (r)-oxazepam is metabolised by several different ugt isoforms, mainly  xxxg2385xxx  and
ugt2b7 [96] (fig. 7). this could explain why a single mutation
can impair (s)-oxazepam, but not (r)-oxazepam, biotransformation.
gender also play a role, as well as the specific genotype [97].
like diazepam, oxazepam has been shown to induce both
 xxxg583xxx  and cyp4a in mice, but only  xxxg583xxx  in rats; this has been

current drug metabolism, 2008, vol. 9, no. 8

833

related to the fact that both drugs induce hepatic carcinogenesis in
mice and not in rats [70].
analytical methods
since glucuronic acid is a chiral molecule, the glucuronidated
forms of oxazepam are diastereomers, not enantiomers. thus, they
can be chromatographically separated without the need for a chiral
selector or a chiral column. in fact, the analytical method used to
study the rate of glucuronidation of the drug [98] is based on hplc
with uv detection (at 214 nm) and the separation of the glucuronides and oxazepam is achieved on a simple c18 column using a
phosphate buffer / acetonitrile mixture as the mobile phase. phenacetin is used as the is. in this case, run times are quite long (more
than 25 minutes) due to the high retention of oxazepam and the is,
however the time needed to separate the analytes is acceptable (9
minutes), considering that they are diastereomers. no sample pretreatment procedure is reported (apart from centrifugation after
incubation), since the matrices are simply human liver microsomes
or purified ugts in buffer.

sedative-hypnotic benzodiazepines
brotizolam
brotizolam (2-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6h-thieno
[3,2-f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]diazepine) is a short-acting thienotriazolodiazepine commercialised as lendormin, nimbisan. it is
used in the short-term treatment of insomnia, although due to its
short half-life it is considered to have relatively high abuse potential
and so it is not a first-line treatment [99].
pharmacokinetics and metabolism
brotizolam is a potent drug with a dosage of 0.5 or 1.0 mg/day
and is rapidly eliminated, having an average t1/2 of 5.1 hours [100].
it is mainly metabolised by cyp3a4 (fig. 8), as demonstrated by
the increase in the drug plasma levels, auc and t1/2, in volunteers
taking simultaneously brotizolam and the antibiotic erythromycin, a
known cyp3a4 inhibitor [101]. a similar effect was observed
when administering the antifungal itraconazole [102]. conversely,
rifampicin (a cyp3a4 inducer) significantly decreases cmax (69%),
auc (90%) and t1/2 (79%) of the drug [103]. therefore, the coadministration of brotizolam and these antibiotics is not recommended.

834 current drug metabolism, 2008, vol. 9, no. 8

analytical methods
the method used to assess possible pharmacokinetic interactions between brotizolam and the antibiotics rifampicin [103] and
erythromycin [101] is a slight variation of a previously published
method [81] on the analysis of etizolam. the method is based on
hplc-uv with column-switching, where the first column (albumin-c8) is used for the pre-treatment of the sample, while the second column (c18) is the analytical stationary phase. the authors
report very good sensitivity for this kind of assay, i.e. a lod value
of 0.3 ng/ml and a loq value of 0.5 ng/ml; precision is also very
good, with a cv of 5.2% at the loq level. as usual in this kind of
analysis, the is is diazepam.

mandrioli et al.

and 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam. the main cyp isoforms responsible
for the formation of both metabolites are cyp3a4 and cyp2c19
[107], however the role of cyp2c19 seems to be minor and differences in its activity are unlikely to affect the clinical effects of the
drug [107]. another study, on the other hand, has found evidence
that cyp3a4 catalyses the formation of hydroxyflunitrazepam and
cyp2c19 the formation of desmethylflunitrazepam (fig. 9), potentially influencing the efficacy and safety of the therapy due to its
high polymorphism [108].  xxxg592xxx  [109] and cyp1a2 [110] have
also been found to be active in vitro in this regard. it is still unclear
which enzyme precisely is responsible for the reduction to 7aminoflunitrazepam; recent studies suggest the involvement of
nadph-cytochrome p 450 reductase [111], at least under hypoxic
conditions.

fig. (9). main metabolic pathways of flunitrazepam.
fig. (8). main metabolic pathways of brotizolam.

for the brotizolam-itraconazole study [102], another, more
recent method was used [104]. it is based on hplc after spe. for
the sample pre-treatment, c18 cartridges were used. in this case, as
well, the lod is quite low (0.5 ng/ml) and precision is satisfactory
(cv < 8.9%, however the concentration level is not indicated).
triazolam is used as the is.
flunitrazepam
flunitrazepam
(5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-7nitro-2h-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) is a nitrobenzodiazepine most
commonly marketed under the trade name rohypnol, but is also
known in some countries as darkene, ilman, insom,  xxxd2127xxx ,
 xxxd2127xxx , nilium,  xxxd2127xxx , valsera and vulbegal. flunitrazepam is usually prescribed for severe insomnia not responsive to
other hypnotics, especially in inpatients [105]. it is considered one
of the most potent hypnotic  xxxd1459xxx  on effect: the usual dose is 0.5-1
mg before going to sleep, with a maximum of 2 mg. abuse of flunitrazepam among drug addicts is considerable and possession of
flunitrazepam without a valid prescription is illegal in many countries.
pharmacokinetics and metabolism
while 80% of flunitrazepam that is taken orally is absorbed,
bioavailability in suppository form is closer to 50% [106]. flunitrazepam has a t1/2 of 18 - 26 h, which means that, after nighttime
administration, flunitrazepam effects persist throughout the next
day. important phase i metabolites are n-desmethylflunitrazepam

buprenorphine is known to interact with flunitrazepam, increasing the frequency and severity of side effects. the exact mechanism
of this interaction is not known, however it probably is pharmacodynamic, not pharmacokinetic: in fact, nor buprenorphine nor its
main metabolite norbuprenorphine significantly inhibit cyp3a4 or
cyp2c19 [112].
the simultaneous administration of alcohol inhibits flunitrazepam metabolism in vitro and in particular the formation of desmethylflunitrazepam (20-40%) and, in a lesser way, of hydroxyflunitrazepam (10-30%); 7-aminoflunitrazepam does not seem to be
affected [113]. the association of ethanol and flunitrazepam can
also cause hepatotoxicity [114].
flunitrazepam is one of the most frequently used drugs for the
purpose of administering it to unsuspecting victims and raping them
while they are under the influence of this substance. thus, its detectability in urine is important to establish the exact timeline of the
crime and the responsibility of suspects and to confirm the victim’s
testimony. the highest concentrations of flunitrazepam and 7aminoflunitrazepam in urine are observed 6-24 h after administration; aminoflunitrazepam levels usually are 100-200 times those of
the parent drug in urine. accordingly, flunitrazepam can be detected in this biological fluid for up to 5 days after intake and
aminoflunitrazepam for up to 28 days [115].
analytical methods
flunitrazepam has been analysed at relatively high concentrations (in the g/ml range) in human microsomes and in cyp solutions by hplc-uv using a c18 column, 234 nm as the detection

benzodiazepine metabolism

wavelength [109] and clonazepam (another nitrobenzodiazepine) as
the is. unfortunately, no other details or references to analytical
studies are reported. another method [108] used hplc-uv at 234
nm to analyse flunitrazepam and its metabolites in microsomes or
expressed cyp within a 17-min chromatographic run. the stationary phase was a c18 column, while the mobile phase was an
acetonitrile/methanol/water mixture (is: clonazepam). the study on
the involvement of cyp3a4 and 2c19 in flunitrazepam metabolism [108] was carried out on microsomes using a previously
published analytical method [116], based on hplc-uv at 210 nm.
this method was specifically developed to quantify the hydroxy
and desmethyl metabolites, however flunitrazepam was analysed as
well. on a c18 column, and using a phosphate buffer / acetonitrile
mixture as the mobile phase, an analytical run lasts about 30 min.
as usual for in vitro experiments, flunitrazepam concentrations
were relatively high (in the g/ml range), however the loq for
both metabolites was 200 nm, corresponding to 66 ng/ml for hydroxyflunitrazepam and 99 ng/ml for desmethylflunitrazepam. the
analytes were extracted by means of n-hexane /  xxxd2052xxx  from
the alkalinised reaction mixture and lorazepam was used as the is.
the analysis of flunitrazepam and its main metabolites in human blood has been carried out by hplc-uv at a wavelength of
250 nm [107]. analyte separation was achieved on a c18 column
within 16 min using a mobile phase consisting of a phosphate
buffer / acetonitrile / methanol / tetrahydrofuran mixture. sample
pre-treatment was carried out by lle with n-hexane/dichloromethane, concentrating the analytes 12.5 times. the loq for all
analytes was 0.5 ng/ml and again clonazepam was the is.
flunitrazepam and aminoflunitrazepam can be analysed in urine
by means of gc-ms with extremely low loq values, 100 pg/ml
for the parent drug and 10 pg/ml for the metabolite [115].
midazolam
midazolam (8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4h-imidazo
[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine) is a short-acting imidazobenzodiazepine used mainly for its action as a sedative (2-2.5 mg in one
dose), before anaesthesia (30-100 hg/kg) or for sedation of intensive care patients (slow i.v. injection, 30-300 hg/kg in 1-2.5 mg
doses every 2 min, then 30-200 hg/kg/h). it can also be used for the
treatment of status epilepticus (10 mg in one dose).
it is marketed under the brand names  xxxd2641xxx ,  xxxd2641xxx ,
 xxxd2641xxx ,  xxxd2641xxx ,  xxxd2641xxx  and versed.
metabolism and pharmacokinetics
midazolam is almost exclusively metabolised by cyp3a4, both
in the intestine (first-pass metabolism) and in the liver [117], producing three hydroxylated metabolites, 1’-hydroxymidazolam, 4hydroxymidazolam and 1’,4-dihydroxymidazolam [118], without
any appreciable contribution from  xxxg592xxx  [119,120],  xxxg583xxx  or
 xxxg584xxx   xxxg585xxx   xxxg587xxx  [121]. this has led to the identification of the drug as the
ideal probe for assessing cyp3a4 activity, its induction and its
inhibition. consequently, most papers published in the last few
years focus on midazolam metabolism, but only as a means to individuate the potential for interactions of other drugs. many compounds have been tested as possible cyp3a4 modulators in this
way in the last ten years, using midazolam as the probe and thus
highlighting possible interactions when they are co-administered
with it. table 1 summarises the main characteristics of these studies; as can be seen, many cyp3a4 inhibitors have been found,
while only a few compounds induce the metabolism of midazolam
[122-150].
the main midazolam metabolite, 1’hydroxymidazolam, is
pharmacologically active and its plasma levels are about two-thirds
those of the parent drug [151]. thus, it can significantly contribute
to the pharmacological effect of midazolam administration, in both
normal and intensive care patients [152]. midazolam pharmacoki-

current drug metabolism, 2008, vol. 9, no. 8

835

netics are strongly dose-dependent: even in patients with hepatic
 xxxg590xxx  induction, the half-life of midazolam increases with high
doses as a result of a rise in its volume of distribution, which is a
consequence of an increase in the free fraction of the drug [153].
recent studies have shown that both midazolam and 1’hydroxymidazolam can undergo n2-glucuronidation catalysed by
 xxxg2381xxx  [154], while 1’-hydroxymidazolam can also undergo 1’o-glucuronidation [155] catalysed by ugt2b4 and ugt2b7 (fig.
10).
the drug can be administered to adults and children of all ages
and for several purposes (sedation, seizure control, pre-surgical
anaesthesia), thus its pharmacokinetic parameters have been studied
in different populations and for different routes of exposure. in
children and adolescents, oral bioavailability of midazolam is extremely variable (9-71%), as well as its disposition. the rate of
formation of 1’-hydroxymidazolam is higher for oral administration
than for i.v. administration [156], probably due to intestinal firstpass metabolism. due to immature hepatic cytochrome cyp3a4
activity, midazolam clearance and 1’-hydroxymidazolam concentration are reduced markedly in preterm infants. for this reason,
caution is advised when administering the drug in the neonatal intensive care setting [157]. similar results, with increased t1/2 and
distribution volume, were found in neonates receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, probably due to midazolam sequestration by the membrane oxygenation circuit [158]. the drug can also
be sub-cutaneously administered during palliative care and when
i.v. administration is not possible. absolute drug bioavailability by
this route is 96%, without significant differences, in terms of auc,
with intravenous infusion. other experimental formulations for
intranasal administration in the treatment of status epilepticus have
been developed; they have high bioavailability (83%) and a metabolic pattern (1’-hydroxymidazolam formation) similar to that of
i.v. administration [159]. sublingual administration in rabbits gave
almost 100% bioavailability and no significant difference from i.v.
administration for the main pharmacokinetic parameters [160].
midazolam is not eliminated by haemofiltration, thus it can be
administered to patients requiring sedation and haemofiltration,
e.g., those suffering from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome
[161]. on the contrary, continuous venovenous haemofiltration is
able to effectively remove 1’-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide
[162].
analytical methods
studies on the metabolism of midazolam in animal microsomes
[118] have been carried out by capillary hplc (internal column
diameter: 0.8 mm) after lle with cyclohexane/dichloromethane.
capillary hplc allows the use of minimal amounts of solvents and
sample, while maintaining good sensitivity. this method was used
for the analysis of midazolam and its three main metabolites; it is a
slight modification of a previously developed method [163] for the
determination of midazolam and the 1’-hydroxy metabolite in human plasma. uv detection is carried out at 240 nm for the analytes
and at 300 nm for the is (diazepam) and a chromatographic run
lasts about 20 min, with gradient elution. while the original method
was fully validated, only a few details are reported for the second
one: apparently, it uses a different is (flunitrazepam) to shorten run
times.
the assays for in vitro studies on glucuronidation [155] were
based on hplc-ms/ms in positive esi mode, with the use of an
ion trap detector: this kind of analyser allows obtaining detailed
information on the chemical structures of the analytes, which were
then completed and confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance
(nmr) spectra. gradient elution and a 3.5-m particle column
granted very good separations of all compounds of interest, which
are structural isomers with the same molecular mass. nmr was
also used to obtain quantitative results.

other assays were carried out on human plasma [151], again
with a slight modification of a previous analytical work [164]. the
method is based on hplc with uv detection (240 nm) and uses a
small-particle (3 m) column. as a consequence, very fast chromatographic separations can be obtained: the total run time for the
analysis of midazolam, 1’hydroxymidazolam and the is diazepam
is less than 5 min. sample pre-treatment is carried out by simple
lle with methyl t-butyl ether. sensitivity (loq = 7 ng/ml) and
precision (rsd < 8%) are satisfactory. on the contrary, the dosedependence of blood levels of midazolam and its monohydroxylated metabolites [153] used an hplc-ms method [165] with outstanding sensitivity (loq = 50 pg/ml for all analytes), even
though precision is comparable (cv < 7.3%). the method is based
on a small diameter (2.1 mm) c18 column and gradient elution; an
ion trap spectrometer allowed working in tandem mass conditions.
sample pre-treatment was carried out by lle with hexane/dichloromethane and midazolam-d6 was used as the is.
other analytical techniques have been used as well, such as
gc-ms [156-158]. for the study on the use of midazolam in neonatal intensive care [157], a 0.2-m diameter capillary bonded stationary phase (phenyl-methylpolysiloxane) was used. only a few
details of the method (and no reference to an analytical paper) are
reported, such as loq (1 ng/ml for midazolam, 0.5 ng/ml for the
1’-hydroxy metabolite) and precision (cv < 10%) values and the
use of a very small amount of sample (50 l) for one analysis.
sample pre-treatment is carried out by spe, however nothing is
said of the procedure, or of the sorbent type.
triazolam
triazolam (8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-4h-[1,2,4]
triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine) is a triazolobenzodiazepine

commercially available as halcion,  xxxd3420xxx ,  xxxd3420xxx  or zotrilax.
it is a short-acting  xxxd1459xxx  used for the treatment of insomnia. normal
doses are extremely low, in the 0.125-0.25 mg range; doses higher
than 0.5 mg are generally avoided. triazolam use has been associated with psychological side effects, such as increased aggressiveness and violent reactions [166]. for this reason, the drug was withdrawn for a period in the usa; now it has been deemed safe at low
doses by the us food and drug administration (fda). however, it
is still banned in some countries, such as the uk.
metabolism and pharmacokinetics
triazolam is mainly metabolised in the liver by cyp3a4 [167],
however none of its metabolites is pharmacologically active. some
pre-systemic metabolism seems also to occur [168], since grapefruit
juice (a known inhibitor of gastro-intestinal cyp3a4) can cause
dramatic changes in the drug bioavailability, with an increase of
96% in the auc(0-24) [169]; repeated doses of juice amplify this
effect [170]. from studies on human recombinant cyp isoforms, it
has been found that the action of cyp3a4 produces two hydroxylated metabolites (1’-hydroxytriazolam and 4-hydroxytriazolam,
fig. 11), while cyp1a2, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6 and
 xxxg589xxx  do not seem to be involved [171]; the possible contribution of  xxxg592xxx  is still uncertain [172]. the importance of
cyp3a4 has been confirmed by the ineffectiveness of oral triazolam therapy during the administration of rifampicin, a potent inducer of this cyp [173]. several other drugs have been shown to
influence triazolam metabolism by way of cyp3a4 interactions;
for example, the antimycobacterial isoniazid [65], the viral protease
inhibitors ritornavir and  xxxd166xxx  [174,175], some reverse transcriptase inhibitors [176], some macrolide antimicrobials [177] and
azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole) [178]
inhibit triazolam biotransformation. on the contrary, the stimulant

838 current drug metabolism, 2008, vol. 9, no. 8

modafinil [179] induces it. the anti-ulcer ranitidine has been reported to increase triazolam auc(0-); however, no increase in the
1’-hydroxytriazolam/triazolam auc(0-) ratio was observed. this
has led to hypothesise that ranitidine increases triazolam absorption
by raising the gastric ph, since the latter drug is acid-labile [180].
since triazolam has been associated to aggressiveness, violence
and abuse, the presence of its metabolites in urine has drawn considerable attention as a possible means of ascertaining (voluntary or
unsuspecting) triazolam intake. the main metabolite, 1’-hydroxytriazolam, is detectable in this fluid for up to 35 h after triazolam intake and reaches its peak urine concentration after 5-10 h
[181], while the urinary excretion rate of the 4-hydroxy metabolite
appears to be slower [182]. both compounds are almost completely
glucuronidated in urine.

fig. (11). main metabolic pathways of triazolam.

analytical methods
like for midazolam, the almost exclusive dependence of triazolam metabolism on cyp3a4 activity has let to the identification of
the drug as one of the ideal probes for cyp3a4 modulation by
other agents. as a consequence, there are plenty of scientific papers
(and related analytical methods) dealing with changes in triazolam
concentrations to assess the potential for interactions of other drugs
or active compounds. some of these deal with matrices such as
recombinant cytochromes or microsomes; we will focus on those,
which deal with biological fluids such as blood or urine.
a study on the effect of grapefruit ingestion [169] used a rather
complicated hplc-uv method to determine triazolam plasma
levels. in fact, the plasma sample pre-treatment consisted of protein
precipitation with methanol, followed by a double preparative
hplc run with fraction collection and re-injection. finally, the
purified sample was injected into a c18 column, with a chromatographic run length of about 15 min. in any case, the method sensitivity seems to be good (loq = 0.5 ng/ml) and precision is acceptable, albeit with high rsd values (up to 18%). interestingly, the
chosen is is not another  xxxd1459xxx , but butyl p-hydroxybenzoate. alternatively, for a similar purpose [170] a capillary gc method was
used. in this case, sample pre-treatment was carried out by spe on
c8 cartridges and detection by electron capture, obtaining higher

mandrioli et al.

sensitivity (loq = 0.1 ng/ml) and comparable precision (rsd <
16%) [183]. while run times were long (30 min), this was due to
the fact that the method was originally developed for the analysis of
15 different anxiolytic-hypnotics.  xxxd2999xxx  was chosen as the is.
two methods were developed for the analysis of triazolam metabolites in urine.
the first method [181] regards 1’-hydroxytriazolam only,
which was analysed on a 30-m fused silica capillary column. the
ms detector uses an electron impact source and a single quadrupole
analyser. sample pre-treatment involves hydrolysis by means of glucuronidase (to analyse free and glucuronidated 1’-hydroxytriazolam) and lle with ethyl acetate after alkalinisation. a complete analytical run lasts about 13 min and, interestingly, 1’hydroxytriazolam-d4 is used as the is. as previously noted, using
deuterated iss is the norm when dealing with ms detection, however most methods dealing with  xxxd1459xxx  metabolism use other bzds
instead. in this case, however, sample composition and coadministered drugs are much more unpredictable (i.e., real samples
come from possible unsuspecting victims), thus analytical interferences cannot be ruled out as in a controlled pharmacokinetic assay:
hence the use of a deuterated analogue. good sensitivity (loq =
0.1 ng/ml) and precision (rsd < 5%) were achieved with this
assay.
it should be noted that bzds usually are not volatile enough to
allow their direct gc analysis; they have to be derivatised by
trimethylsilylation first. this, of course, introduces a further pretreatment step and a possible source of error in the procedure.
the second method [182] deals with the analysis of both 1’hydroxytriazolam and 4-hydroxytriazolam in urine by hplc-ms.
since in this case the setting was tightly controlled, the is was nitrazepam, another  xxxd1459xxx  as usual. analyte separation was achieved
on a c18 column using ammonium acetate /methanol as the mobile
phase. ms detection was carried out by esi and single quadrupole.
again, all samples were hydrolysed with -glucuronidase and extracted by lle with hexane/dichloromethane. the loq values
were 2 ng/ml for 1’-hydroxytriazolam and 1 ng/ml for 4hydroxytriazolam; precision values, expressed as rsd, were always
under 10.5%.
conclusion
in this review, an overview has been presented of the recent
advances (1998-today) in the knowledge of metabolism and possible interactions of the most widely used bzds. furthermore, details
have been given and comparisons have been made regarding the
analytical methods used to obtain the corresponding data. the reliability of the latter is of the utmost importance, since any clinical or
therapeutic evaluation is only as good as the data on which it is
based.
a plethora of analytical methods, based on several different
techniques, has been published even in very recent times on the
analysis of one or more bzds and/or metabolites in human biological fluids [184-190]. however, most of them were not specifically
developed (or adapted and used) with the aim of evaluating metabolic parameters, thus their suitability for this purpose remains
unknown.
on the contrary, this review was focused on those methods,
which have been tested on metabolism or pharmacokinetic studies.
reversed phase lc is by far the most frequently used technique,
followed by gc, represented only by a few cases. this is a long
established trend in the drug analysis field, due to the extreme
flexibility of hplc techniques, their ease of coupling to a wide
variety of detectors and their applicability to most analytes. gc is
mostly used for particular analytes, or when an established method
and existing instrumentation are at hand.
for both separation techniques, coupling to ms detection is
increasing in frequency. ms is almost ubiquitous for gc and only a

few methods use other detection means (such as electron capture
and nitrogen-phosphorus). hplc-ms, on the other hand, is rapidly
gaining widespread acceptance, however uv detection is still very
common. while the superior sensitivity and selectivity of ms is a
matter of fact, uv detection has still several attractive features:
extremely wide availability, much lower entrance and maintenance
costs, ease of operation and low number operative variables. thus,
uv detection can be a very attractive alternative to ms to carry out
a less expensive study, especially when the matrix is simple (e.g.,
recombinant cytochromes) or sensitivity is not an issue. of course,
when structural information on the analytes is needed, uv is not
useful and ms is the technique of choice.
with regard to sample pre-treatment procedures, several have
been used (protein precipitation, column switching, preparative
hplc, lle, spe), however lle and spe are by far the most frequent. lle in particular seems to be still very widespread, probably
because it results in very simple procedures. spe is gaining importance, due to the low consumption of organic solvents and to the
possibility of automation; furthermore, method development is
more straightforward and usually sample cleaning and extraction
yields are better than those of lle. however, spe can be somewhat more expensive due to the cost of cartridges.
