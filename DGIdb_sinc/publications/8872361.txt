regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine release from isolated tracheae
of newborn rabbits

1 isolated tracheae of newborn rabbits were incubated in vitro and the outflow of 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-ht) was determined by h.p.l.c. with electrochemical detection. evidence has previously been provided
that this 5-ht outflow derives from neuroendocrine epithelial (nee) cells of the airway mucosa.
2 phenylephrine (1, 10 and 30 gum) enhanced the outflow of 5-ht by 80, 290 and 205%, respectively.
5-ht outflow evoked by 10 gim phenylephrine was not affected by the presence of the neurotoxin
tetrodotoxin (1 pm).
3 rauwolscine, arc 239 (an a2b-adrenoceptor preferring antagonist), yohimbine and  xxxd3000xxx 
antagonized the effect of 10 gm phenylephrine in a concentration-dependent manner with icm values
of 150, 295, 300 and 1,700 nm, respectively. comparison of the ratios (between all antagonists) of the
present ic50 values with the corresponding ratios of ki values obtained in binding studies for the a2a-,
a2b-, x2c- and cx2d-adrenoceptor subtypes strongly suggests the involvement of an c2b-receptor.
4 5-ht outflow evoked by 10 im phenylephrine was inhibited by 65% in the presence of 1 gm
 xxxd1742xxx  and abolished in the presence of 10 gm  xxxd1742xxx .
5 5-ht outflow evoked by 10 gm phenylephrine was inhibited by about 45 and 70% in the presence of
0.1 and 1 gm  xxxd2398xxx , respectively. the inhibitory effect of 1 gm  xxxd2398xxx  was only marginally
antagonized by 1 gm, but blocked by 10 gm propranolol.
6 5-ht outflow was not affected by the muscarine receptor agonist oxotremorine (10 gm), but was
enhanced by 175% by 100 gm nicotine. the effect of nicotine was blocked by 100 gm hexamethonium
and prevented by 1 gm tetrodotoxin or 1 gm yohimbine.
7 in conclusion, 5-ht release from nee cells of the rabbit trachea is stimulated via a-adrenoceptors
most likely of the a2b-subtype localized directly at the nee cells. activation of ,b-adrenoceptors as well
as direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by  xxxd1742xxx  exert inhibitory effects on 5-ht release. activation of
nicotinic, but not of muscarinic receptors, also evokes the release of 5-ht. however, the effect of
nicotine appears to be mediated indirectly via the release of noradrenaline.

introduction
the airway mucosa of different mammals contains a system of
specialized epithelial cells which express a number of neuroendocrine markers, such as  xxxg702xxx ,  xxxg2236xxx  or chromogranins (e.g. lee et al., 1987; balaguer
& romano, 1991; adriaensen & scheuermann, 1993; bousbaa
et al., 1994). so far, these neuroendocrine epithelial (nee)
cells have been characterized primarily by morphological aspects and by their content of various peptides and amines (e.g
lauweryns et al., 1972; 1982; cutz et al., 1975; 1981; track &
cutz, 1982; polak & bloom, 1982; scheuermann, 1987;
adriaensen & scheuermann, 1993). 5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht) is an important amine in the nee cells (dey et al., 1981;
lauweryns et al., 1973; 1982) where it appears to be stored in
dense core vesicles (i.e. secretory granules of the nee cells)
(owman et al., 1973; cutz et al., 1975; scheuermann, 1987;
adriaensen & scheuermann, 1993). 5-ht together with the
different secretory peptides may be released from the nee cells
in response to specific, at present however, largely unknown
stimuli.

morphological studies demonstrating various nerve endings
in the airway mucosa and in close proximity to nee cells (see
adriaensen & scheuermann, 1993; jeffery, 1994) suggest that
intrinsic neurotransmitters might be involved in the control of
nee cells. there is some evidence that cholinergic, nicotinic
1 author for correspondence.

mechanisms may play a role in the regulation of the secretory
activity of nee cells (e.g. lauweryns et al., 1977; 1987; tabassian et al., 1990; nylen et al., 1990; 1993). in addition, nee
cells may be a target for local, paracrine mediators and also for
various inhaled agents.
very recently, we obtained evidence that the outflow of 5ht from rabbit isolated tracheae reflects secretion from nee
cells (freitag et al., 1995). in agreement with the morphological observations that the density of nee cells is particularly
high during the perinatal period (redick & hung, 1984; cho et
al., 1989), 5-ht outflow from tracheae of newborn animals
was higher than that from tissue of adults. moreover, it was
observed that adrenaline, via activation of a-adrenoceptors,
enhanced the outflow of 5-ht providing further evidence that
receptor mediated control mechanisms may indeed be of significance in the modulation of the secretory activity of nee.
in the present experiments the outflow of 5-ht from isolated tracheae of newborn rabbits was used as an in vitro model
to study possible regulatory mechanisms which might play a
role in the control of nee cells. the aims of the present experiments were to characterize further the above described aadrenoceptor-mediated stimulation of 5-ht release and to test
whether f-adrenoceptors and/or muscarinic or nicotinic cholinoceptors may also participate in the regulation of 5-ht release from these nee cells.
preliminary accounts of part of the present results have
been given (freitag et al., 1996a,b).

methods

animals
newborn mongrel rabbits of either sex were used within 24 h
after birth. most of the animals were from lammers (euskirchen, germany) except those for one series which were from
koch (edingen, germany) and this is indicated. animals were
treated humanly and the present study was approved by local
authorities (ordnungsamt bonn).

preparation and incubation of the tracheae
the animals were killed by stunning followed by exsanguination. the whole tracheae were dissected and freed from connective tissue. single preparations were fixed in a glass organ
bath and then incubated in 1.4 ml krebs-hepes solution of
the following composition (mm): nacl 118.5, kcl 5.7, cacl2
1.25, mgcl2 1.2, na2edta 0.03, (+ ) xxxd228xxx  0.06,
hepes 20.0 (adjusted to ph 7.4 using naoh) and d-glucose
11.1. the medium was kept at 37°c and continuously gassed
with 100% 02. the bath fluid was changed every 10 min. the
medium was collected in plastic tubes which contained 50 pl of
57 mm (+ ) xxxd228xxx , 50 pl of 10 mm edta and 100 jil of
1 m perchloric acid (suprapure) to protect released 5-ht and
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) from spontaneous nonenzymatic degradation.
at the end of the incubation each preparation was blotted,
weighed and extracted in 1 ml of 0.4 m hcio4 for 2 h at 04°c. the supernatants were stored at 0-4°c and analysed
within 3 days. no significant loss of 5-ht or 5-hiaa occurred
within that time period.

measurement of 5-ht and 5-hiaa
5-ht and 5-hiaa were measured by high pressure liquid
chromatography (h.p.l.c.) with electrochemical detection as
described previously (schw6rer et al., 1987). the separation of
5-ht and 5-hiaa was achieved by a reverse phase column
(length 250 mm, inner diameter 4.6 mm, prepacked with
shadon ods- xxxd3100xxx , 5 ,m) with a mobile phase of 0.1 m
phosphate buffer (adjusted to ph 3.0), containing octane sulphonic acid sodium salt (160 mg i'), sodium edta (0.3 mm)
and methanol (12%, v/v) with retention times of about 21 and
15 min, respectively. quantitation was achieved with an electrochemical detector (gynkothek m20) equipped with a glass
carbon working electrode and an ag/ag reference electrode.
the potential was set to + 0.72 v. portions of 200 pl of the
incubation media or tissue extracts were directly injected into
the h.p.l.c. column. the limit of detection was between 20 and
60 fmol for 5-ht and between 15 and 25 fmol for 5-hiaa per

tracheal 5-ht release
was applied. correlation coefficients and their statistical significance were also calculated by use of instat.

rauwolscine hydrochloride (roth, karlsruhe, germany);  xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride (pfizer, karlsruhe, germany); tetrodotoxin (novabiochem, bad soden, germany). drugs were
dissolved in distilled water, 1 mm hcl (phenylephrine, rauwolscine, yohimbine) or ethanol (75% or 100%) ( xxxd1742xxx ,
 xxxd3000xxx , tetrodotoxin). ethanol alone at the maximum concentration (0.1%) did not affect spontaneous or phenylephrine-evoked 5-ht outflow.

results

spontaneous outflow and tissue levels of 5-ht and 5hiaa
the mean spontaneous outflow of 5-ht from mucosa-containing tracheae of newborn rabbits in the absence of drugs
(measured between 50 and 60 min of incubation) was
15.7+ 1.1 and that of 5-hiaa 18.1 + 1.5 pmol g-1 10 min(n = 61). similar to previous observation (freitag et al., 1995),
in control experiments the outflow of 5-ht (figure 1) and that
of 5-hiaa (not shown) continuously declined during the observation period. as the outflow of 5-hiaa changed only
marginally in response to the various treatments described
below the data on 5-hiaa outflow area are not documented in
detail.
tissue 5-ht at the end of incubation amounted to
641+21 pmol g-' and tissue 5-hiaa to 24+1 pmol g-'
(n = 160). as none of the treatments caused significant effects
on these tissue levels, pooled values are given.

a-adrenoceptor-mediated stimulation of 5-ht outflow
phenylephrine induced a marked, transient rise in the outflow
of 5-ht (figure 1), and the concentration-dependency of this

injection.

calculations and statistical analysis
the outflow of 5-ht and 5-hiaa is expressed as pmol per g
wet weight of tissue and per collection period (pmol g-1,
10 min-') or as a percentage of the mean outflow observed
from 40 to 50 min or from 50 to 60 min of incubation (depending on the experimental protocol, compare figures 1 and
4) of the individual experiments (= 'initial outflow'). the stimulation evoked outflow of 5-ht was calculated by summing
the 5-ht outflow that exceeded the basal outflow. the respective basal outflow was extrapolated from the individual
initial outflow assuming that the fractional decline would be
similar to that observed in control experiments. in interaction
experiments 5-ht outflow was expressed as percentage of the
mean increase in 5-ht outflow evoked by the respective sti-

mulus (phenylephrine or nicotine) in the absence of any further
drug. mean values are given + s.e.mean of n experiments. the
significance of differences was evaluated by anova followed
by student's t test, by the computer programme instat. when
multiple comparisons were carried out, bonferoni's correction

effect is shown in figure 2. a rise in 5-ht outflow by 80 and
290% was observed at 1 and 10 lm phenylephrine, respectively. however, after increasing the concentration of phenylephrine to 30 gm, the stimulating effect tended to decrease
again, resulting in a bell-shaped concentration-response curve.
in absolute terms, 5-ht released by 10 gm phenylephrine
amounted to 32 + 3.4 pmol g- (n = 22). the stimulating effect
of 10 gm phenylephrine was antagonized by rauwolscine, arc
239, yohimbine and  xxxd3000xxx  in a concentration-dependent
manner (figure 3) with ic50 values of 150, 295, 300 and
1700 nm, respectively (table 1). when the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (1 um) was present, the stimulating effect of 10 gm
phenylephrine was not significantly affected (figure 8).

fl-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of 5-ht outflow and
role of  xxxd1773xxx 

 xxxd2398xxx  added 10 min before the phenylephrine (10 mm)
stimulus reduced the evoked increase in 5-ht outflow in a
concentration-dependent manner, by 46 and 72% at 0.1 and
1 gm, respectively (figures 4 and 5). when  xxxd2398xxx  was
tested at a concentration of 10 gm, an impurity present in the
 xxxd2398xxx  solution produced a peak in the chromatogram
close to 5-ht making it difficult to read exactly small 5-ht

peaks. therefore, it should only be mentioned that 10 gm
 xxxd2398xxx  'appeared' to suppress almost completely the
phenylephrine-evoked 5-ht outflow. the inhibitory effect of
1 gm  xxxd2398xxx  was antagonized by propranolol in a concentration-dependent manner, but relatively high concentrations of propanolol were required (figure 5).  xxxd2398xxx  also
reduced the spontaneous outflow of 5-ht, maximally by about
40% (see figure 4). however, as in other experiments the
spontaneous outflow of 5-ht was close to the detection limit,
inhibitory effects on spontaneous outflow are difficult to describe quantitatively. therefore, effects on spontaneous outflow are not documented in detail.
 xxxd1742xxx  added 10 min before the phenylephrine (10 mm)
stimulus also inhibited the evoked increase in 5-ht outflow, by
67% at 1 gm and completely  xxxd1891xxx  mm (figure 6). with the
limitations just mentioned for effects on spontaneous outflow,
 xxxd1742xxx  also reduced the spontaneous outflow, to a similar
extent as did  xxxd2398xxx  (not shown).

cholinoceptor-mediated effects on 5-ht outflow
the muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine (10 gm) had no
effect on 5-ht outflow (figure 7). on the other hand, 5-ht
outflow was increased by 175% by 100 gm nicotine, but not
affected by 10 gm nicotine. the stimulating effect of 100 gm
nicotine was blocked by 100 gm hexamethonium. in contrast
to the stimulating effect of phenylephrine, that of nicotine was

blocked in the presence of 1 gm tetrodotoxin (figure 8). most
interestingly, yohimbine (1 mm) also prevented the stimulating
effect of 100 gm nicotine (figure 8).
however, it should be noted that in one series of experiments, for which the animals were supplied by another farm
(koch, edingen), 100 pm nicotine caused only a marginal increase in 5-ht outflow (25.6+13.0%, n= 15, p>0.2), although in this series phenylephrine evoked an outflow of 5-ht
similar to that described above (data not shown).

previous experiments have shown that the in vitro, incubated
isolated trachea of the rabbit, and particularly that of newborn
animals, may be a useful preparation to study 5-ht release
from airway nee cells (freitag et al., 1995). thus, it was
shown that 5-ht outflow from that preparation depended on
an intact mucosa and could be evoked by a depolarizing stimulus in a calcium-dependent manner, indicating, together
with additional observations, that 5-ht outflow may reflect 5ht secretion from nee cells. it was further observed that
adrenaline enhanced the outflow of 5-ht, an effect antagonized by  xxxd2914xxx  and  xxxd3000xxx , but not by propranolol
which rather tended to enhance the stimulating effect of
adrenaline (freitag et al., 1995).

stimulant a2b-adrenoceptors
in the present experiments another a-adrenoceptor agonist,
phenylephrine effectively stimulated the outflow of 5-ht. the
effect of phenylephrine remained unaffected in the presence of
tetrodotoxin, a neurotoxin which blocks propagated neuronal
activity (catterall, 1980), excluding an indirect, neuronally
mediated action and supporting the idea that stimulant aadrenoceptors may be localized directly at the nee cells. a

non-neuronal, paracrine mechanism cannot, however, be excluded. although phenylephrine is generally considered to be
an a1-adrenoceptor-selective agonist (see hoffman & lefkowitz, 1990), the present observation that the effect of phenylephrine was not only antagonized by  xxxd3000xxx , but also, and
with even higher potencies, by the a2-adrenoceptor selective
antagonists rauwolscine and yohimbine (figure 3 and table 1),
indicated that a2-adrenoceptors mediated that stimulating effect on 5-ht secretion from nee cells.
currently, four subtypes of x2-adrenoceptors, x2a-, x2b-, x2cand a2d-receptors, can be differentiated by pharmacological
and molecular biological techniques (lomasney et al., 1991;
bylund et al., 1994). at the different a2-adrenoceptor subtypes,
 xxxd3000xxx  shows a relatively high affinity for the x2b- and o2creceptors. when the ic50 values of rauwolsine, arc 239, yohimbine and  xxxd3000xxx  obtained in the present experiments were
correlated with the respective ki values for the different k-

adrenoceptor subtypes (given in table 1), a significant correlation was obtained only for the a2b-receptor (r = 0.97,
p<0.05). the availability of subtype selective antagonists
useful for the characterization of a2-adrenoceptor subtypes in
functional experiments is still limited and particularly the
pharmacological discrimination between x2b- and a2c-receptors
is difficult. arc 239 shows some preference for the m2b-receptor (bylund et al., 1988; 1992) and its relatively high potency in the present experiments is in support of an a2breceptor. the comparison of ratios of ki values of a2-adrenoceptor antagonists obtained in radioligand binding studies
with the respective ratios of functionally determined antagonistic potencies has been shown to be helpful for the differentiation of a2-adrenoceptor subtypes involved in functional

response (simonneaux et al., 1991; lawhead et al., 1992;
limberger et al., 1992; molderings & g6thert, 1995). such a
comparison for the present observations is summarized in
table 2. again, a significant correlation of the data for nee
cells was found only for the x2b-receptor (r = 0.91, p = 0.01). in
addition, the absolute values of all ratios for nee cells were
close to those for the a2b-receptor. these observations strongly
support the contention that the (x2-adrenoceptors on nee cells
belong to the cx2b-subtype.
as already mentioned, phenylephrine is generally considered to be an al-adrenoceptor selective agonist. indeed,
functional experiments carried out long before the differentiation of a2-adrenoceptors into four subtypes was known,
showed phenylephrine to be only a weak agonist in eliciting a2adrenoceptor-mediated responses (see starke, 1981). in binding studies, however, the affinity constants of phenylephrine
for al-adrenoceptors were even somewhat lower than those for
a2-adrenoceptors (see starke, 1981), suggesting low intrinsic
activity of phenylephrine at a2-adrenoceptors. on the other
hand, nothing is known about possible differences in the activity of phenylephrine at the different a2-adrenoceptor subtypes. from the present observations it appears that
phenylephrine is an effective agonist at the o2b-subtype. here,
it should be emphasized that at present only very few data
about the functional role of a2b-receptors are available. we are
aware of only one study in which sufficient evidence supported
the conclusion that a functional response (inhibition of sensory
neurotransmission) was mediated via a2b-receptors (fuder &
selbach, 1993).

inhibitory p-adrenoceptors and role of  xxxd1773xxx 
the spontaneous as well as the phenylephrine-evoked outflow
of 5-ht was inhibited by  xxxd2398xxx . the effect of  xxxd2398xxx  was antagonized by propranolol indicating the involvement of specific fl-adrenoceptors. however, the potencies
of both, the agonist  xxxd2398xxx  and the antagonist propranolol, were relatively low. this suggests that an atypical f1adrenoceptor (possibly a fl3-adrenoceptor) mediated that effect, since these are characteristics of #3-adrenoceptors. however, more detailed pharmacological studies will be necessary
for a clear characterization of the present fi-adrenoceptor.
generally, f-adrenoceptors mediate the activation of adenylyl
cyclase (lefkowitz et al., 1983) and such an effect may also be
involved in the present inhibition of 5-ht release from nee
cells. at least  xxxd1742xxx , which is known to activate directly
adenylyl cyclase (seamon et al., 1981), also inhibited both the
spontaneous and evoked 5-ht outflow.
although at present little is known about the functional
significance of 5-ht release from nee cells of the airways,
there is some evidence that 5-ht could be involved in the
development of broncho-obstructive symptoms (see cazzola et
al., 1995). since f-adrenoceptor agonists play an important
role in the treatment of broncho-obstructive diseases, it is an
interesting idea that nee cells might be an additional target
for p-adrenoceptor agonists in the airways.

tracheal 5-ht release

role of cholinoceptors
muscarinic receptor-mediated effects appear not to play a role
in the control of nee cells of the rabbit trachea, as the muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine, even at the high concentration of 10 gm, failed to affect the outflow of 5-ht. on
the other hand, nicotine caused an increase in 5-ht release
which was blocked by hexamethonium indicating that specific
nicotine receptors mediated that effect. in contrast to the effect
of phenylephrine, the stimulation of 5-ht release by nicotine
was prevented by tetrodotoxin. thus, in the rabbit trachea
nicotine appears not to act directly at the nee cells, but may
induce the release of a stimulating neurotransmitter. since
yohimbine also blocked the effect of nicotine, it is concluded
that nicotine may stimulate the release of noradrenaline which
may activate the above described a2b-adrenoceptors on the
nee cells. these observations demonstrate, in addition, that
these a2b-adrenoceptors are indeed a target for the endogenous
neurotransmitter.
in contrast to the present observations which do not indicate the presence of nicotinic receptors on the nee cells of
rabbit trachea there are several studies which suggest that nicotinic receptors might be present on lung nee cells of other
species, either in primary culture (nylen et al., 1993) or in
different neuroendocrine cell lines derived from small cell lung
cancer (schuler, 1989; tarroni et al., 1992; catteneo et al.,
1993; quik et al., 1994). whether this discrepancy reflects
species differences or cell specific differences (nee of upper
versus lower airways) remains to be established. the present
finding that large differences in the magnitude of the effect of
nicotine were observed dependent on the source of the animals
suggests a particular variability of nicotinic effects. whether
environmental factors or whether strain differences account for
the variations observed in our study is unclear. on the other
hand, it should be pointed out that the a-adrenoceptor-mediated stimulation of 5-ht release did not show such variability.
in conclusion, 5-ht release from nee cells of the trachea
of newborn rabbit is stimulated via o-adrenoceptors which
have characteristics of the a2b-subtype and which appear to be
localized directly at the nee cells. activation of /-adrenoceptors, for which propranolol showed relatively low affinity,
as well as direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by  xxxd1742xxx 
induced inhibitory effects on 5-ht release and opposed the a2adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation. activation of nicotinic
receptors, but not of muscarinic receptors also evoked the release of 5-ht. however, the effect of nicotine appears to be
mediated indirectly via the release of noradrenaline which acts
via the described a2b-adrenoceptors on the nee cells.
