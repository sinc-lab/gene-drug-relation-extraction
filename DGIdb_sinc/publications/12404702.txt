 xxxd155xxx  binds selectively to dopamine d2 and d3 receptors in the limbic system. low doses of  xxxd155xxx 
preferentially block presynaptic d2/d3-dopamine autoreceptors, thereby enhancing dopaminergic transmission, whereas
higher doses block postsynaptic receptors, thus inhibiting dopaminergic hyperactivity.  xxxd155xxx  is clinically effective
on the negative symptoms of acute schizophrenia exacerbations at low dosages (50Â±300 mg/day), and also on the positive
symptoms of the disease at high dosages (400Â±800 mg/day). nineteen clinical studies involving 358 volunteers have investigated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of  xxxd155xxx .  xxxd155xxx  shows linear pharmacokinetics, a bioavailability of 48%, low protein binding (17%) and an elimination half-life of  12 h. it is predominantly
eliminated in the urine as the parent compound. it exhibits no signiÂ®cant detrimental effects in psychometric or memory
tests up to the dose of 400 mg/day, inducing only mild impairment at high doses, whereas eeg data suggest an alertnessenhancing effect at low doses (50 mg). moreover,  xxxd155xxx  does not potentiate the depressant effects on the central
nervous system of alcohol and lorazepam. this tolerability proÂ®le is  xxxd102xxx  than that of haloperidol 4 mg/day and
is consistent with a weak blocking effect on striatal d2 receptors. in summary, studies in humans have shown that
 xxxd155xxx  is free of behavioural toxicity at doses exerting clear antipsychotic efÂ®cacy and conÂ®rm that its cns effects
may vary with the dose administered. copyright # 2002 john wiley & sons, ltd.

introduction
 xxxd155xxx , a substituted benzamide, selectively
blocks cerebral dopamine d2 and d3 receptors
(sokoloff et al., 1992; schoemaker et al., 1997). in
vivo it shows a higher afÂ®nity for limbic than striatal
dopamine receptors, which points to a favourable
neurological safety proÂ®le in humans (schoemaker
et al., 1997). in addition, low doses of  xxxd155xxx 
preferentially block presynaptic d2/d3-dopamine
autoreceptors, thereby facilitating dopamine transmission, whereas higher doses block postsynaptic
d2/d3-dopamine receptors, thus inhibiting dopa*correspondence to: p. rosenzweig, department of internal

minergic hyperactivity (perrault et al., 1997). this
novel dual dopamine receptor-blocking effect is consistent with the improvement of the negative symptoms
of schizophrenia at low dosages (50Â±300 mg/day) of
 xxxd155xxx  and of the positive symptoms at higher
dosages (400Â±800 mg/day).
our objective was to review non-therapeutic trials of
 xxxd155xxx  in order to investigate its pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics and tolerability, both in healthy
volunteers and in certain categories of nonpsychotic at-risk patients.
the signiÂ®cance and safety of pharmacological
studies on antipsychotics carried out in volunteers
have been questioned in recent years. however,
interest in such studies returned with the recent
availability of new antipsychotics, including  xxxd155xxx , and of new investigative techniques, such as
positron emission tomography (pet). moreover, a
consensus conference convened by the british
received april 2001
accepted 14 june 2001

p. rosenzweig et al.

association of psychopharmacology (bap) recently
issued a set of guidelines regarding studies of antipsychotics in healthy volunteers, stating that such studies
may be useful for the following three main reasons:
(1) studies in healthy humans bridge the gap between
animal laboratory experiments and clinical trials in
patients, allowing the investigation of drug actions
in human beings without the confounding effects of
illness-related factors; (2) although it is a widespread
belief that volunteers are more sensitive than patients
to antipsychotics, this has not been deÂ®nitely established, and the differences that have been reported
may well be the consequence of methodological
variations, including acute or chronic dosing conditions; (3) useful pharmacodynamic information can
be derived from eeg recordings, cognitive testing
and pet studies in healthy volunteers (king and the
bap consensus group, 1997).
the pharmacological studies of  xxxd155xxx  in
humans aimed to investigate: (1) its pharmacokinetic
characteristics (absorption, distribution, metabolism
and excretion) in healthy young volunteers and in
at-risk groups of subjects (aged subjects, renally
impaired patients); (2) its pharmacodynamic proÂ®le,
including its effects on psychomotor and memory performances, body sway and pharmaco-eeg; and (3) its
clinical tolerability.
methods
nineteen clinical studies of the pharmacology of
 xxxd155xxx  (13 on pharmacokinetics and metabolism, six on pharmacodynamics) have been performed
on a total of 358 subjects. of these subjects, 288 were
aged between 18 and 40 (mean age  sd Âˆ 25  4
years; mean weight  sd Âˆ 71  9 kg), 37 were aged
more than 65 years (69  4 years; 68  9 kg) and 33
were renally impaired patients (52  15 years;
67  14 kg; creatinine clearance 80Â±50 ml/min: 6
patients, 50Â±20 ml/min: 11 patients, 20Â±10 ml: 10
patients, < 10 ml/min: 6 patients).
all the studies assessing the pharmacodynamic
characteristics of  xxxd155xxx  were double-blind,
crossover, placebo-controlled studies involving single
or multiple daily oral administrations at doses ranging
from 50 mg to 400 mg. the studies used a comprehensive battery of validated objective and subjective tests
that are commonly used in psychopharmacological
studies and that are capable of detecting minor
changes in vigilance and memory performance. the
battery comprised tests exploring psychomotor performance and attention (critical Â¯icker fusion threshold [cfft], choice reaction time [crt], critical

tracking task [ctt], divided attention task [dat],
continuous performance task [vig], tapping, body
sway), information processing (arithmetic calculation, digit symbol substitution test [dsst], syntactic
reasoning, stroop test), memory (working memory,
word or picture list for declarative memory, word item
completion for implicit memory, tower of toronto for
procedural memory), eeg recordings, and subjective
evaluations (stanford sleepiness scale, bond and
lader visual analog scales [vas] for alertness,
addiction research center inventory [arci] for
drug-related feelings (haertzen, 1966), `subjective
well-being under neuroleptics' scale [swn] (naber
et al., 1994), and schizophrenia positive and negative
symptoms scale [panss] (kay, 1991).
all studies were approved by an independent ethics
committee, and all participants gave their informed
written consent prior to study entry.
results
pharmacokinetics
the main pharmacokinetic characteristics of  xxxd155xxx , as previously reported by coukell et al. (1996),
are summarised in table 1.
the proÂ®le established by pooling all data from
pharmacokinetic studies reveals no dose dependency
of  xxxd155xxx :
 half-life, renal clearance and amount excreted in
urine as unchanged  xxxd155xxx  are the same regardless of the dose administered;
 auc(0Â±1) increases as a function of the dose;
 cmax is the parameter of greatest variability, possibly because of the complex absorption pattern;
 in patients receiving up to 1200 mg/day, trough
plasma levels are proportional to the dose.
absorption. the absolute bioavailability of the 50 mg
tablet is  50% (range 48Â±51%). absorption is rapid.
two plasma concentration peaks are generally
observed, the Â®rst peak occurring approximately 1 h
after oral administration.
distribution. distribution volume of  xxxd155xxx  is
5.8 l/kg (sd 0.4 l).  xxxd155xxx  shows a weak afÂ®nity for plasma proteins (17%), suggesting a low risk
of interaction with coadministered drugs.
excretion and metabolism.  xxxd155xxx  is primarily
excreted in urine: at doses of 50Â±200 mg, almost
50% of an intravenous dose and 22Â±25% of an oral

dose are recovered in urine as the unchanged
compound. renal clearance, which ranges from 17
to 20 l/h (330 ml/min), exhibits very little variation
with the dose administered but does correlate with
creatinine clearance. drug clearance is reduced in
renally impaired patients, and also in elderly subjects,
probably owing to age-related reduction in renal function.  xxxd155xxx  undergoes only minimal metabolic
transformation. after oral administration of radiolabelled  xxxd155xxx , all the radioactivity found in
plasma is attributable to unchanged  xxxd155xxx .
similarly, the radioactivity excreted in urine and
faeces relates almost solely to the unchanged compound. the pharmacokinetic proÂ®le of  xxxd155xxx 
remains unchanged after repeated daily administrations of a 200 mg dose for 7 days.  xxxd192xxx  half-life
is not altered after repeated administration, which suggests the absence of inducing or inhibiting effects on
hepatic microsomal enzyme activity. only a small
amount of  xxxd155xxx  is removed from the circulation
after a 3 h haemodialysis session.
elimination. the value of t1/2 reported in table 1
was determined after intravenous administration,
using a two compartment model. as previously

reported (coukell et al., 1996), elimination is also
biphasic after oral administration and can be
described by an open two compartment model. however, because of the difÂ®culty in modelling the
absorption phase (due to the two plasma concentration peaks), determination of the initial elimination
phase is not always correct. hence, only the terminal
elimination phase can be calculated accurately.
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd155xxx  enantiomers. after
administration of  xxxd155xxx , which is a racemate,
either by the oral or the intravenous route, plasma
concentration proÂ®les of (s)- and (r)-enantiomers
are parallel, with constantly higher concentrations
of the (s)-enantiomer (figure 1). the (s)- and (r)enantiomers are in the ratio of  1.3 for cmax and
auc, whatever the administration route. enantiomer
pharmacokinetics are not altered after repeated oral
administrations in healthy volunteers (le bricon
et al., 1996) or in aged subjects.
interactions. the risk of drug-drug interactions is
limited, owing to the low levels of plasma protein
binding and metabolism. furthermore,  xxxd155xxx 
was not shown to affect the activity of the main

alcohol have been studied during the course of the
pharmacodynamic studies. results suggest a moderate increase in  xxxd155xxx  absorption (10Â±20%
increase in plasma concentration) by the concomitant
ingestion of alcohol. no interaction with lorazepam
was observed.

vigilance, sensory-motor coordination and information processing (table 2), as well as body sway.
furthermore, a 4 day treatment with repeated daily
doses of 50 mg  xxxd155xxx  showed no detrimental
effects, compared with placebo, in several tests
(including a tracking task) administered to subjects
in a sleep-deprivation state, a condition known to
potentiate the sedative effects of drugs acting on the
central nervous system (cns) (patat et al., 1999). a
signiÂ®cant improvement in hand steadiness was also
observed after Â®ve daily doses of 50 mg  xxxd155xxx 
(ramaekers et al., 1999).

single doses of 100 mg and 200 mg  xxxd155xxx 
were also free of deleterious effects on psychomotor
performance and body sway (mattila et al., 1996;
peretti et al., 1997; perault et al., 1998). in another
study (legangneux et al., 2000), elderly subjects
showed a signiÂ®cant (p < 0.05) improvement in reaction time in a vig test (digit vigilance task) after a
200 mg dose (figure 2).
a single administration of a high dose (400 mg)
of  xxxd155xxx  did not cause any alterations in selective and divided attention, motor activity, sensoryÂ±
motor coordination or vigilance in healthy volunteers. however, repeated administrations of  xxxd155xxx  400 mg/day for 4 days induced signiÂ®cant
impairments in several tests, including ctt, crt,
dat, dsst and vig (event detection vigilance task)
(figures 3Â±5) (ramaekers et al., 1999). thus,
repeated administrations of high doses of  xxxd155xxx  may entail some sedative effects in healthy
volunteers.
finally, no pharmacodynamic interactions impacting psychomotor performance were detected after
the concurrent administration of 50 mg or 200 mg of
 xxxd155xxx  with 0.8 g/kg of ethanol or 2 mg of lorazepam to young subjects (mattila et al., 1996; perault
et al., 1998). in contrast, haloperidol induced signiÂ®cant impairments in various tasks after single or
copyright # 2002 john wiley & sons, ltd.

repeated administrations either to young subjects
(deterioration of performance in ctt, dat and
crt at 3 h and 6 h, and vig at 4 h and 7 h, after 4
mg (single dose) or 4 mg/day for Â®ve days) (figures
3Â±5, table 2) (peretti et al., 1997; ramaekers et al.,
1999) or to elderly subjects (increase in detection
time in vig 9 h and 24 h after a single dose of 2
mg) (figure 2) (legangneux et al., 2000). these
marked deleterious effects are at variance with those
observed after 400 mg  xxxd155xxx  in young
volunteers or after 50 mg and 200 mg in elderly subjects (ramaekers et al., 1999; legangneux et al.,
2000).
potential alertness-enhancing effects of a low dose
of  xxxd155xxx  (50 mg/day for 4 days) were assessed
in healthy young subjects using a sleep deprivation
procedure. sleep deÂ®ciency is known to impair Â¯exibility and perseverance, to decrease motivation, to
diminish performance in sustained and selective
attention tasks, owing to a lowering of the arousal
level, and to accelerate performance deterioration
over time on a given task. therefore, sleep deprivation is a recognised model for the investigation of a
drug's alertness-enhancing effects. caffeine was
used as a positive control. no detrimental effects of
 xxxd155xxx  50 mg/day were found in an array of
psychomotor performance and cognitive tests

carried out in sleep-deprived volunteers. moreover,
subjects' performance after treatment with this low
dose of  xxxd155xxx  was frequently found to be intermediate between those noted after placebo and after
caffeine, and the performance improvement intensiÂ®ed
at the end of the 4 day treatment period (14 h and
19 h after the last  xxxd155xxx  dose) (patat et al.,
1999).
memory
whichever dose of  xxxd155xxx  is administered
(50, 100, 200, or 400 mg), a single administration is
without clinically relevant detrimental effects on
working memory (ramaekers et al., 1999; legangneux et al., 2000), declarative memory (immediate
free recall, delayed free recall, picture or word recognition) (mattila et al., 1996; perault et al. 1998; peretti et al., 1997; legangneux et al., 2000), implicit
memory (picture stem completion) (peretti et al.,
1997) and procedural memory (tower of toronto)
(peretti et al., 1997). however, repeated administrations of  xxxd155xxx  400 mg/day to young subjects
caused some working memory impairment 3 h and
6 h after dosing, and an increase in reaction time in
the syntactic reasoning task, but this effect was notacopyright # 2002 john wiley & sons, ltd.

bly less than after single or multiple doses of 4 mg of
haloperidol (ramaekers et al., 1999).
no pharmacodynamic interaction impacting memory was noted when  xxxd155xxx  (50 mg or 200 mg)
was administered concurrently with 0.8 g/kg of alcohol or 2 mg of lorazepam (mattila et al., 1996; perault
et al., 1998).
in contrast, in young subjects, both a single dose
and multiple daily doses of haloperidol 4 mg caused
signiÂ®cant working memory impairment when compared with placebo and  xxxd155xxx  50 mg or
400 mg (ramaekers et al., 1999). as low a dose as
2 mg of haloperidol may also signiÂ®cantly impair
working memory in elderly subjects from 2 h to 12
h after dosing (legangneux et al., 2000). in addition,
1 mg or 2 mg of haloperidol may induce a signiÂ®cant
decrease in procedural memory in young volunteers:
while remaining able to acquire a problem-solving
routine (despite a mild psychomotor slowing down
and some degree of cognitive sluggishness), haloperidol-treated subjects needed signiÂ®cantly more steps
than control subjects to achieve the test objective,
and some of them routinised a non-optimal solution.
overall, haloperidol-treated subjects are characterised by a low reliability index in solving problems
(peretti et al., 1997).

in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, saletu
et al. (1994) investigated the pharmaco-eeg proÂ®le
of a single dose of  xxxd155xxx  (12.5, 25, 50 or 100
mg) in 10 healthy volunteers. eeg analyses revealed
only weak and inconsistent effects of  xxxd155xxx 
across the dose range studied. however, some eeg
activation, primarily characterised by an increase in
fast beta waves, was detected in resting conditions
after the administration of 12.5 mg and 25 mg  xxxd155xxx . these quantitative eeg changes were less
evident after a dose of 50 mg or 100 mg.

in a placebo-controlled study performed in sleepdeprived subjects, eeg recordings obtained in resting
conditions were submitted to spectral analysis, in order
to assess the potential alertness-enhancing effects of
 xxxd155xxx  (50 mg/day for 4 days) (patat et al.,

was a trend (0.05 < p < 0.10) towards increased spectral activity for all frequency bands and eeg leads at
the other time points. effects on slow delta and theta
waves were also observed throughout the study day,
with increases of 50Â±100%, whereas the effects on beta
waves predominated at the end of the sleep deprivation
period (14Â±19 h), with increases of about 100% compared with placebo.
thus, signiÂ®cant improvements or trends toward
an improvement in alertness, characterised by
increased eeg power in absolute and relative beta
waves (12Â±40 hz), were observed after administration
of  xxxd155xxx . similar changes were also noted after
the ingestion of caffeine (two 300 mg slow-release
caffeine capsules on the fourth study day), which
was used as an active control in the same study. differences between  xxxd155xxx  and placebo were
mostly apparent at the end of the sleep deprivation
period, i.e. 19 h after dosing (figure 6) (patat et al.,
1999).

in subjective feelings, as assessed by visual analogue
scales or by questionnaires (stanford sleepiness
scale, arci). in most studies,  xxxd155xxx  did not
show any sedative effects at dosages up to 400 mg/
day in young subjects or after a single 200 mg dose
in elderly subjects (mattila et al., 1996; peretti et al.,
1997; perault et al., 1998; patat et al., 1999;
ramaekers et al., 1999; legangneux et al., 2000).
at dosages up to 400 mg/day,  xxxd155xxx  did not
induce any signiÂ®cant change in the swn scale score
or in the panss `negative symptoms' and `general
psychopathology' subscales scores in healthy
volunteers. of the 13 feelings scored by the psychiatrists, only drowsiness was rated as signiÂ®cantly
increased after  xxxd155xxx  (400 mg/day), compared
with placebo (ramaekers et al., 1999). the lack of
consistent sedative effects of  xxxd155xxx  demonstrated by the subjective assessment conÂ®rms the
results of the objective tests. it was also observed in
sleep-deprived subjects (patat et al., 1999).
in contrast, single and multiple doses of haloperidol (4 mg/day) or lorazepam (2 mg) used as active
controls induced marked and statistically signiÂ®cant
sedative effects. these were characterised by an
increase in the pcag (pentobarbitone-chlorproma-

zine-alcohol group) sedation score and by decreases
in the bg (benzedrine group) alertness and ag
(amphetamines group) activation/motivation scores
of arci (from 2 h to 8 h after lorazepam; from 3 h
to 6 h after the Â®rst administration of haloperidol,
and over the whole observation period after Â®ve daily
doses of haloperidol). both lorazepam and haloperidol were also associated with signiÂ®cant changes in
the mbg (morphine-benzedrine group) euphoria
score and in the lsd ( xxxd2527xxx 
group) somatic distress (discomfort) score, with
similar time courses (perault et al., 1998; ramaekers
et al., 1999). in addition, in contrast to placebo and
 xxxd155xxx  50 mg or 400 mg, haloperidol 4 mg/day
induced a signiÂ®cant impairment of well-being, which
was especially noticeable on the subscale scores of
arci exploring emotional regulation and mental
and physical functioning, as well as on the swn scale
score (ramaekers et al., 1999). the two panss subscales (`negative symptoms' and `general psychopathology') also revealed signiÂ®cant behavioural
impairments with haloperidol, compared with
placebo and  xxxd155xxx . finally, based on the
psychiatrist's clinical global impression, haloperidol
stands out as markedly different from placebo and
 xxxd155xxx : much more frequent and severe adverse
effects occur with haloperidol than with placebo or
 xxxd155xxx , which may impact the central functions
involved in daily activities.

discussion and conclusions
pharmacodynamic studies that accurately evaluate a
drug's cognitive and psychomotor effects are important in collecting useful information on the safety proÂ®le of neuroleptics, i.e. the nature and severity of their
adverse effects, the possible relationship between
their pharmacodynamic effects and pharmacokinetic
parameters, and their mechanisms of action in psychosis. however, studies carried out in schizophrenic
patients have failed to demonstrate any consistent
effects of typical or atypical neuroleptics on psychomotor and cognitive functions. obviously, studies in
schizophrenic patients are made difÂ®cult by a number
of confounding factors, including problems in controlling for dosage and duration of treatment, the ethical inadvisability of using an inactive placebo control,
the inÂ¯uence of learning and motivation, and factors
relating to schizophrenia itself (different clinical subtypes, changes in symptom severity over time, comorbidities, co-medications, etc.) (king, 1990; 1994).
impairments of cognitive function in schizophrenic

patients, such as attention and information-processing
deÂ®cits, intellectual sluggishness and formal thought
disorders, complicate the interpretation of drug
effects. in addition, the potentiality of neuroleptics
themselves to induce negative symptoms remains a
matter of controversy.
conventional antipsychotics exert sedative and
anticholinergic side effects and may induce extrapyramidal symptoms (for a review see heaton and
crowley, 1988). memory decrements are ascribed to
the anticholinergic properties of neuroleptics, and
there is some evidence of additional effects on
visuomotor integration, attention and global
intelligence. one can expect all these effects to impair
performance in various psychomotor, cognitive and
memory tests. medalia et al. (1988) reported that cognitive functions are differently affected in schizophrenic patients, depending on treatment duration: acute
neuroleptic treatment exerts obvious adverse effects
on motor and visuomotor skills, whereas longer-term
effects include impairments in planning ability and
Â®ne motor coordination.
thus, although the therapeutic efÂ®cacy of antipsychotic drugs is well documented, their potential clinical beneÂ®ts should be weighed against their potential
risks. the most common and obvious side effects of
standard neuroleptics are extrapyramidal motor control disturbances, i.e. parkinson-like rigidity, tremor,
bradykinesia, akathisia, acute dystonia and tardive
dyskinesia. atypical neuroleptics (e.g. clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine,  xxxd155xxx ) exhibit no or a
much smaller propensity to induce extrapyramidal
symptoms than standard neuroleptics. nevertheless,
most atypical neuroleptics (clozapine, risperidone,
olanzapine) can be expected to induce cns side
effects (e.g. anhedonia, lethargy, inability to concentrate and dysphoria) similar in frequency and severity
to those observed with standard agents such as butyrophenone and phenothiazines, since they also bind to
various neuron receptors (e.g. 1-adrenergic, h1histaminergic and muscarinic receptors) not involved
in the antipsychotic activity but instead in the occurrence of adverse effects (goldberg and weinberger,
1996; casey, 1996). some of these central side effects
are difÂ®cult to differentiate from the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and may be under-recognised
by physicians. they are, however, troublesome in
the management of psychotic patients.
in order to avoid the confounding factors that
obscure the interpretation of neuropsychological
effects of drugs in psychotic patients, central effects
of antipsychotics can be investigated in psychometric
studies carried out in healthy volunteers, using objechum psychopharmacol clin exp 2002; 17: 1Â±13.

tive and subjective tests to compare the actions of the
drug with those of placebo on affective, cognitive and
psychomotor functions (king, 1990; 1994). the
premise underlying such studies is that psychotic
patients and healthy volunteers react in similar ways
to all drug activities that are pharmacologically
unrelated to the antipsychotic effect. evidence supporting this premise was recently reviewed at a
consensus conference convened by the british association for psychopharmacology: the conclusion was
that properly designed and conducted studies in
healthy volunteers are valid for evaluating the side
effects of antipsychotic drugs (king and the bap
consensus group, 1997).
results of such studies in non-psychotic volunteers
have demonstrated that single oral doses of  xxxd155xxx  up to 400 mg and multiple daily doses of
50 mg given to young or elderly subjects have minimal and not clinically signiÂ®cant effects on various
aspects of psychomotor performance and memory,
as well as on subjective evaluations. the studies used
tests that assessed the effects of  xxxd155xxx  on arousal
(cfft), speed of reaction (reaction time), motor
activity, vigilance (continuous performance tasks),
tracking, information processing, short- and longterm explicit memory, implicit memory (picture stem
completion) and procedural memory. additional studies showed that single doses of  xxxd155xxx  up to
200 mg do not potentiate the detrimental effects of
ethanol or lorazepam.
eeg and cognitive performance evaluations performed in sleep-deprived subjects who were given
multiple low doses of  xxxd155xxx  (50 mg) point to a
possible alertness-enhancing effect, as suggested
by an increase in absolute (mainly 12Â±16 hz and
30Â±40 hz) beta and relative fast beta (30Â±40 hz) energies on the eeg. sleep deprivation, which is known to
potentiate the sedative effects of drugs, did not reveal
any sedative potential of  xxxd155xxx ; instead,  xxxd155xxx  reduced the impact on eeg of the vigilance
impairment caused by sleep deprivation. the effects
of  xxxd155xxx  were intermediate between those of
placebo and caffeine in various psychometric tests.
similar results pointing to the alertness-enhancing
effects of a low dose of  xxxd155xxx  (25 mg or
50 mg) were also reported in previous studies (gruÃ¨nberger et al., 1989; saletu et al., 1994).
in a pet scan study performed in both patients
with schizophrenia and in normal control subjects,
and using labelled bromolisuride as a probe, martinot
et al. (1990) estimated the proportion of striatal d2receptors blocked by 50Â±100 mg/day of  xxxd155xxx 
at 4Â±22%. these data conÂ®rm that these doses can

be regarded as low compared with the doses used
for the treatment of acute psychosis.
on the other hand, repeated administration of a
relatively high dose of  xxxd155xxx  (400 mg daily)
demonstrated some sedative effects in various tests,
including tracking, reaction time, selective and
divided attention and vigilance, in young volunteers.
these effects may be ascribed to the drug's nonspeciÂ®c dampening effect on waking arousal, which
was subjectively experienced as an unusual drowsiness unaccompanied by dysphoria. however, these
effects were signiÂ®cantly less pronounced than those
observed after multiple doses of haloperidol 2 mg
(ramaekers et al., 1999).
in contrast to  xxxd155xxx , a single dose of 2 mg or
4 mg of haloperidol induced signiÂ®cant deterioration
of psychomotor and cognitive skills in young and
elderly subjects, as well as a number of mental disturbances, as revealed by alterations of the subjective
clinical scale scores. effects similar in nature but of
a larger magnitude were observed after repeated
administrations of haloperidol. comparable results
have been found in previous studies. in the literature
on haloperidol (saletu et al., 1983; mcclelland et al.,
1987; mcclelland et al., 1990; leigh et al., 1992;
king, 1993; king, 1994; hindmarch and tiplady,
1994; rammsayer and gallhofer, 1995; lynch, et al.,
1997), these effects are reported to occur in a dosedependent manner with doses of haloperidol of 2 mg
or higher (king, 1994). there is a high incidence of
subjective dysphoria and akathisia after 4 mg and
6 mg of haloperidol in volunteers but not after 2 mg
(king et al., 1995). interestingly, the threshold dose
for these effects is very similar to the `neuroleptic
threshold' (3.7 mg) described by mcevoy et al.
(1991) in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that the
ability to tolerate acute doses of neuroleptics may
not be markedly different between healthy volunteers
and psychotic patients.
although a 50Â±300 mg daily dose of  xxxd155xxx  is
effective in the treatment of patients with enduring
predominant negative symptoms, positive symptoms
in patients with acute exacerbations require daily
doses of 400Â±800 mg or even 1200 mg. thus the
400 mg dose used in healthy volunteers is at the low
end of the therapeutic range for positive symptoms.
controversies remain concerning the dose-dependent
effect of haloperidol. in contrast, even though a large
range of doses is used in current practice, data have
shown that doses of haloperidol as low as 5 mg/day
may be realistic for patients who tolerate neuroleptics
poorly, usually because of extrapyramidal side effects
(van putten et al., 1990).

in summary,  xxxd155xxx  is an atypical antipsychotic
that, in contrast to other atypical antipsychotics, binds
selectively to d2/d3-dopamine receptors with high
and similar afÂ®nity. in addition, it binds earlier and
to a greater extent to mesolimbic neurons, thereby
achieving antipsychotic efÂ®cacy at cerebral concentrations lower than those causing the degree of striatal
receptor occupancy necessary for the emergence of
extrapyramidal symptoms. this pharmacological proÂ®le, which is also characterised by preferential effects
on presynaptic neurones and limbic structures, may
explain the clinical efÂ®cacy of  xxxd155xxx  in the
treatment of both positive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia and its low propensity to induce
extrapyramidal symptoms. the data presented in this
review suggest that  xxxd155xxx  behaves as a welltolerated antipsychotic drug in healthy volunteers,
especially considering the low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects, and the absence of impact on cognitive function. at moderate doses  xxxd155xxx  is free
of sedative effects and moreover at low doses it displays some potential alerting effects. one can expect
the side effects of  xxxd155xxx  to be much less
troublesome to patients on chronic antipsychotic
treatment than those induced by standard antipsychotics
(such as haloperidol) and by the recent atypical
antipsychotics that bind to numerous neuron receptors
not involved in antipsychotic activity.
