abstract
previously we have shown that gabapentin causes a reduction of paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus of the
urethane-anesthetized rat, which looks very much like the effect of baclofen on paired-pulse inhibition. in addition,
it has been proposed that gabapentin increases release of gaba from non-vesicular stores and may, therefore,
interact with gabab mechanisms. here we tested the ability of a gabab agonist, baclofen, and a gabab
antagonist, cgp35348, to block the effect of gabapentin on paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus in
urethane-anesthetized adult sprague–dawley rats. both baclofen (6 mg/kg) and gabapentin (100 mg/kg) caused a
long-lasting reduction of paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus when given alone or in combination. cgp35348
(45 mg/kg) blocked the effect of baclofen on paired-pulse inhibition, but did not alter the effect of gabapentin.
gabapentin also caused a reduction of inhibition in the ca1 region, indicating that its effect is not specific for the
dentate gyrus. these results suggest that gabapentin produces its effect on paired-pulse inhibition independent from
the effect of baclofen and not through non-vesicular release of gaba interacting with the  xxxg828xxx  system.

1. introduction
in the past 4 years, several new antiepileptic
drugs have been approved for use in the united
states. one of them, gabapentin, was experimentally designed to act as a gaba agonist.

gabapentin, despite its structural similarity to
gaba, has no action on gabaergic neurons,
does not bind to gabaa or gabab receptors,
and is not converted into gaba (taylor, 1995;
shorvon, 1996; taylor et al., 1998). because of its
amino acid structure it has been suggested that
gabapentin interacts with the enzymes/carriers associated with the amino acid neurotransmitters
(taylor, 1995). gabapentin also increases the con-

centration of gaba in the brain and may increase the non-vesicular release of gaba (honmou et al., 1995; taylor et al., 1998).
augmentation of inhibition is felt to be antiepileptic and reduction in inhibition is pro-convulsant. paired-pulse inhibition in the rat
hippocampus has been used for many years as a
marker for inhibitory function. gabaa agonists
(muscimol and diazepam) increase paired-pulse
inhibition (rock and taylor, 1986; kapur et al.,
1989), while gabaa antagonists (bicuculline and
 xxxd2947xxx ) decrease paired-pulse inhibition (joy
and albertson, 1988; kapur et al., 1989). therefore, we would have predicted that gabapentin, if
it functions to augment the gabaergic system,
would increase paired-pulse inhibition. recently it
has been shown that gabapentin causes a decrease
in paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus
(xiong and stringer, 1997) and this is quite puzzling. gabapentin also prolongs the epsp (excitatory postsynaptic potential), an action that is
consistent with a reduction of gabaa inhibition
and with the reduction in paired-pulse inhibition.
the reduction of inhibition with gabapentin looks
very much like the effect of baclofen (a gabab
agonist) in the dentate gyrus (brucato et al.,
1995). perhaps gabapentin has a mechanism in
common with the presynaptic actions of baclofen.
to begin to test this hypothesis, we tested the
interaction of baclofen or cgp35348 (a gabab
antagonist) with gabapentin on paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus in the urethane-anesthetized rat in vivo. we also tested whether this
effect of gabapentin was specific for the dentate
gyrus by testing its effect on paired-pulse inhibition in ca1.

2. methods
adult male sprague – dawley rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.2 g/kg) and placed in a
stereotaxic frame (nose bar at 0.0). for measurements of paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate
gyrus, a bipolar stimulating electrode (twisted
stainless steel, 0.01 in) was placed in the right
angular bundle (ap: − 8, l: 4.4, d: 3.0). the
recording electrode, filled with 1% fast green in 2

m nacl, was placed in the dentate gyrus on the
right (ap: − 3, l: 1.8, d: 3.0). the final placement of the recording electrode in the dorsal leaf
of the dentate gyrus was based on responses
evoked by stimulation of the right angular bundle.
for measurements of paired-pulse inhibition in
ca1, a concentric bipolar electrode was placed in
the ca3 region of the left hippocampus at an
angle of 5° towards the midline (ap: − 3, l: 3.5,
d: 2.8). the recording electrode was placed in the
ca1 cell body layer on the right (ap: − 3, l: 1.8,
d: 2.0). the final placement of the recording
electrode in the ca1 cell layer was based on
responses evoked by stimulation of the contralateral ca3 region. the animal was grounded
through a subcutaneous ag/agcl wire in the
scapular region. stimulation was controlled by a
digital timer led to constant current stimulus isolation units. individual stimuli consisted of 0.3-ms
biphasic pulses.
inhibition was measured using the paired-pulse
technique (kapur et al., 1989; stringer and lothman, 1989). the amount of paired-pulse inhibition was determined by calculating the ratio of the
amplitude of the population spike in response to
the second stimulus to the amplitude of the population spike in response to the first stimulus (inhibition ratio). it has been shown previously that
the inhibition ratio is independent of stimulus
intensity at stimulus intensities that produce a
maximal population spike (kapur et al., 1989;
stringer and lothman, 1989). therefore, measurements of inhibition were always done using a
stimulus intensity that produced a population
spike greater than 80% of the maximum. in the
dentate gyrus, feedback inhibition is relatively
short in duration, only lasting 20–40 ms (stringer
and lothman, 1989), and a decrease in inhibition
would be readily detectable at 20–30 ms. therefore, the ratio of inhibition in the dentate gyrus
was determined at 20, 30 and 40 ms. inhibition in
the ca1 region is longer lasting, so interpulse
intervals between 60 and 200 ms were tested.
inhibition ratios before and after vehicle or drug
were compared with a paired t-test. statistical
significance was defined as pb 0.05.
gabapentin was a gift from parke davis (ann
arbor, mi). it was dissolved in deionized water

j.l. stringer, n. lorenzo / epilepsy research 33 (1999) 169–176

up to 50 mg/ml. baclofen (sigma, st. louis, mo)
was dissolved in deionized water up to 5 mg/ml.
both baclofen and gabapentin were administered
by intraperitoneal injection. the dose ranges for
gabapentin and baclofen were determined from
previous experiments (xiong and stringer, 1997)
and from reports in the literature (brucato et al.,
1995; taylor, 1995). cgp35348 was a gift from
novartis (basel, switzerland). it was dissolved in
normal saline at 15 mg/ml and administered intravenously into a lateral tail vein. the initial dose of
cgp35348 was chosen based on the reports of its
effect in vivo (olpe et al., 1990, 1993). olpe et al.
(1990) have reported that cgp35348 is most effective at blocking the behavioral effects of baclofen if the two drugs are administered
simultaneously and that the effect of cgp35348 is
partially gone by 2 h. based on these data, the
present study administered cgp35348 simultaneously with baclofen or gabapentin and monitored responses for 1.5 h.
at the conclusion of each experiment, the positions of all electrodes were confirmed histologically. fast green was iontophoresed out of each
recording electrode and current was passed
through the metal electrodes. the animals were
then perfused through the heart with 1% potassium ferrocyanide in 10% buffered formalin. the
brains were subsequently equilibrated in 30% sucrose/10% buffered formalin. sections (35 mm)
were cut on a sliding microtome and stained with
cresyl violet.

3. results
before determining the interaction between
gabapentin and baclofen, it was necessary to determine the time course and dose response relationships for the effects of both drugs on
paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus. initially, gabapentin, at 50 mg/kg (n = 6), and baclofen,  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg (n =4), were tested.
measurements of the inhibition ratio were obtained every 20 min at interpulse intervals of 20
and 30 ms. after three baseline measurements,
either drug or vehicle was administered and the
inhibition ratio was monitored for an additional

171

4.5 h. vehicle did not cause a significant change in
the inhibition ratio, although there was a slight
tendency for the inhibition to increase over time.
administration of either gabapentin (fig. 1) or
baclofen (fig. 2) caused a reduction of pairedpulse inhibition that lasted the duration of the
experiment. both drugs reached maximal effectiveness by 60 min.
next, the dose response relationships for both
gabapentin and baclofen were determined (fig. 3).
for comparison across animals and doses, a
change in inhibition ratio (d as shown in fig. 1)
was calculated using the inhibition ratio just before drug administration and that 60 min after
drug administration for both the 20- and 30-ms
interpulse interval. because it was the earliest time
point at which the drugs were consistently, and
maximally, active, 60 min was chosen as the comparison point. for gabapentin, doses between 10
and 300 mg/kg were tested. the maximal effect
was seen with 100 mg/kg. increasing the dose
beyond this amount did not increase the effect on
paired-pulse inhibition. for baclofen, doses between 1 and 10 mg/kg were tested. the maximal
effect was measured at 6 mg/kg. vehicle controls
(n= 8) were also tested and showed a slight, but
not significant, increase in the inhibition ratio at 1
h.
given the dose response relationship and the
time course of action, the interaction between
gabapentin and baclofen was tested by administration of the drugs 1 h apart. the doses chosen
were the doses that produced the maximal effects
on paired-pulse inhibition, i.e. 100 mg/kg for
gabapentin and 6 mg/kg for baclofen. the time, 1
h apart, was chosen so that each drug had completely taken effect, but also had not begun to
lose effectiveness at the time of testing after administration of the second drug. as before, three
baseline measurements of the inhibition ratios
were obtained 20 min apart, then the first drug
was administered. the inhibition ratios were measured 1 h later to determine the effect of the first
drug and to serve as a baseline for the second
drug. the second drug was then administered.
the final inhibition ratios were determined 1 h
later. the change in inhibition ratio for the second drug was determined by subtracting the inter-

determined by dividing the amplitude of the population spike
in response to the second stimulation (p2) by the amplitude of
the population spike in response to the first stimulation (p1).
measurements of the inhibition ratio were determined at 20(filled squares) and 30-ms (filled triangles) interpulse intervals
every 20 min. three measurements were done before administration of 100 mg/kg gabapentin, then the responses were
monitored for an additional 4.5 h. for comparison across
animals and doses, a change in inhibition ratio (d) was calculated using the inhibition ratio just before drug administration
to that 60 min after drug administration.

mediate measurement (after 1 h) from this final
measurement of inhibition. in five animals, the
baclofen was administered first, followed by the
gabapentin (fig. 4). in five other animals, the
gabapentin was administered first, followed by the
baclofen.
the administration of gabapentin in the presence of baclofen was compared to the administration of gabapentin alone. the change in inhibition
ratio after administration of gabapentin alone,
100 mg/kg, was 0.34 9 0.04 (n= 8) and in the
presence of baclofen was 0.509 0.06 (n= 5) at the
20-ms interpulse interval. the administration of
baclofen in the presence of gabapentin was compared to the administration of baclofen alone.
the change in inhibition ratio after administration of baclofen alone, 6 mg/kg, was 0.24 9 0.04
(n= 11) and in the presence of 100 mg/kg
gabapentin was 0.499 0.13 (n=5) at 20-ms interpulse interval. in all animals, after administration
of both drugs, there was facilitation of the population spike in response to the second stimulus of
the pair at the 30-ms interpulse interval. in other
words, there was no remaining inhibition to be
lost. statistical comparisons were done at the
20-ms interpulse interval and there was a statistically significant increase in the change in inhibition ratio for both gabapentin and baclofen when
administered in the presence of the other drug. in
spite of the reduction of paired-pulse inhibition
after administration of both baclofen and
gabapentin, angular bundle stimulation never
evoked more than one population spike and spontaneous epileptiform activity was not recorded in
any animal.
initial experiments determined that 45 mg/kg of
cgp35348 would block the effect of 6 mg/kg
baclofen on paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate
gyrus when the drugs were administered simultaneously (30 mg/kg of cgp35348 was only partially effective). paired-pulse inhibition was
recorded every 20 min for a total of 1.5 h. both
20- and 30-ms interpulse intervals were tested.
statistical analysis was done 1 h after drug administration using the 20-ms interpulse interval (fig.
5). cgp35348 alone (45 mg/kg, n= 5) did not
alter the amount of paired-pulse inhibition, but
significantly decreased the effect of 6 mg/kg ba-

caused no change in the effect of gabapentin on
paired-pulse inhibition. the combination of
gabapentin and cgp35348 was not statistically
different from the effect of gabapentin alone.
to determine whether the effect of gabapentin
on paired-pulse inhibition is specific for the dentate gyrus, we recorded from five additional animals, but stimulated in ca3 while recording in
the contralateral ca1 cell body layer. in each
animal paired-pulse inhibition was tested with a
series of interpulse intervals, beginning where
there was no population spike in response to the

second stimulation, and ending where the population spike in response to the second stimulation
was at least 80% of the size of the population
spike in response to the first stimulation. in the
absence of drug, the population spike in response
to the second stimulation usually appears at interpulse intervals longer than 100 ms. after administration of 100 mg/kg gabapentin (fig. 6), there
was a consistent reduction of inhibition, such that
the population spike in response to the second
stimulation appeared at shorter interpulse intervals compared to baseline.

4. discussion
in summary, dose response curves for the effect
of baclofen and gabapentin on paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus determined the maximal effects of both drugs. both baclofen and
gabapentin caused a long-lasting reduction of
paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus when
given alone. using maximal doses, neither

175

gabapentin nor baclofen reduced the effect of
subsequent administration of the other drug. in
other words, pre-treatment with baclofen did not
reduce the effect of gabapentin. conversely, pretreatment with gabapentin did not reduce the
subsequent effect of baclofen. cgp35348, at 45
mg/kg, blocked the effect of baclofen on pairedpulse inhibition, but did not alter the effect of
gabapentin.
although the results presented in this paper are
quite consistent and clear, there are some technical limitations to the quantification and statistical
analysis. the inhibition ratio at the 20-ms interpulse interval was generally zero before drug administration, while at 30-ms interpulse interval the
ratio was \ 0. after drug administration, a
change in the inhibition ratio for the 30-ms interpulse interval was usually observed before the
change in the 20-ms interval (for example, see the
graph in fig. 2). it appears that the change at the
20-ms interpulse interval is coming from somewhere less than zero. therefore, the change in
inhibition ratio at 20-ms interpulse interval appears smaller than it may otherwise be. in the
present study, the change in inhibition ratio when
baclofen and gabapentin were administered together was significantly greater than the changes
with either drug alone. this is probably due to the
fact that each drug alone was changing from
‘below’ zero, then the second drug was added
when the inhibition ratio was above zero and the
full effect was recorded. the opposite problem
occurs when comparisons are made using the
30-ms interpulse interval. when there has been
complete reduction of inhibition and facilitation is
present, then it is impossible to compare changes
in inhibition ratio.
previously, gabapentin has been shown to cause
a reduction of paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus (xiong and stringer, 1997), which
looks very much like the effect of baclofen on
paired-pulse inhibition (brucato et al., 1995). in
addition, it has been proposed that gabapentin
increases release of gaba from non-vesicular
stores (honmou et al., 1995) and may, therefore,
interact with gabab mechanisms (taylor et al.,
1998). this possible mechanism was tested by
trying to block the effect of gabapentin on paired-

176

j.l. stringer, n. lorenzo / epilepsy research 33 (1999) 169–176

pulse inhibition using either a gabab agonist, or
a gabab antagonist. the results indicate that
gabapentin does not produce its effect on pairedpulse inhibition via non-vesicular release of
gaba, which then acts on the  xxxg828xxx 
system. the results are consistent with previous
observations that gabapentin does not bind to
either gabaa or gabab receptors (taylor et al.,
1998).
how then does the gabapentin reduce pairedpulse inhibition? the additive effects of baclofen
and gabapentin on paired-pulse inhibition suggest
that the drugs are acting at completely independent sites. it was expected that if baclofen and
gabapentin were acting at two different sites, but
within the same system (for example, receptor and
g-protein), then maximal effects of one drug
would reduce the effectiveness of the other drug.
this was not the case. it is possible that either
drug alone cannot cause a maximal reduction in
paired-pulse inhibition. for example, baclofen
binding to the presynaptic  xxxg828xxx 
causes a partial reduction in gaba release. addition of gabapentin, which must act at a different
site, causes another partial reduction in gaba
release. in this example, baclofen and gabapentin
act through the same system, but at independent
sites. the experiments presented here cannot determine the mechanisms of these changes.
gabapentin also caused a reduction of inhibition in the ca1 region, indicating that its effect is
not specific for the dentate gyrus. therefore, it
appears that administration of gabapentin causes
a generalized reduction of paired-pulse inhibition.
in spite of this change, gabapentin is an antiepileptic drug. does this mean that reduction of
paired-pulse inhibition is not related to seizure
onset? one could argue that the mechanisms underlying the reduction in paired-pulse inhibition
in this case are not mechanisms that promote
seizure onset. further support for this hypothesis
comes from the observation that even with near
complete reduction of paired-pulse inhibition in
the dentate gyrus after combined administration
of baclofen and gabapentin, there was no evidence
of spontaneous epileptiform activity or even multiple population spikes in response to stimulation.
