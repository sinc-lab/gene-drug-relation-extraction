the sleep-aids zolpidem and  xxxd2047xxx  exert their effects by binding to and modulating gamma-aminobutyric
acid type-a receptors (gabaars), but little is known about the structural requirements for their actions.
we made 24 cysteine mutations in the benzodiazepine ( xxxd1459xxx ) binding site of r1beta2gamma2 gabaars and measured
zolpidem,  xxxd2047xxx , and  xxxd1459xxx -site antagonist binding. mutations in gamma2loop d and r1loops a and b altered
the affinity of all ligands tested, indicating that these loops are important for  xxxd1459xxx  pocket structural integrity.
in contrast, gamma2loop e and r1loop c mutations differentially affected ligand affinity, suggesting that these
loops are important for ligand selectivity. in agreement with our mutagenesis data,  xxxd2047xxx  docking
yielded a single model stabilized by several hydrogen bonds. zolpidem docking yielded three equally
populated orientations with few polar interactions, suggesting that unlike  xxxd2047xxx , zolpidem relies more
on shape recognition of the binding pocket than on specific residue interactions and may explain why zolpidem
is highly r1- and  xxxg842xxx -subunit selective.
introduction
insomnia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality
resulting from accidents, cardiovascular disease, and psychiatric
disorders.1 approximately 10% of the population suffers from
insomnia,2 with an estimated 2.5% using medications to aid
sleep each year.1 past pharmacological treatments have included
barbiturates and benzodiazepines (bzdsa), both of which
promote sleep by binding to and allosterically modulating
gabaa receptors (gabaars) in the central nervous system.
these drugs however, have several unwanted side effects
including alteration of sleep architecture, nightmares, agitation,
confusion, lethargy, withdrawal, and a risk of dependence and
abuse.3 the newest generation of  xxxd1940xxx  drugs, the non- xxxd1459xxx 
hypnotics, was developed to overcome some of these disadvantages. these drugs, which include zolpidem (zpm) and
 xxxd2047xxx  (esz) (figure 1), act through a similar neural
mechanism as classical bzds in that they bind to the same site
in the gabaar but differ significantly in their chemical
structures and neuropharmacological profiles. unlike classical
bzds, the non-bzds have minimal impact on cognitive function
and psychomotor performance while facilitating more restorative
sleep stages, thus inducing a pattern and quality of sleep similar
to that of natural sleep.4,5 moreover, patients taking non-bzds
are less likely to exhibit tolerance, physical dependence, or
withdrawal.4-7
unlike classical bzds, the sedative/hypnotic effect of zpm
occurs at much lower doses than the other pharmacological
effects attributed to  xxxd1459xxx -site action such as muscle relaxation
and anticonvulsant activity.7 this likely results from its selective
binding to a specific gabaar subtype. the gabaar is a

pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that can be formed by
several different subunits (e.g., r, beta, gamma, etc.) and subunit
isoforms (e.g., r1, r2, r3, etc.). receptors composed of different
subunits have different kinetics, cellular distributions, and
pharmacological profiles. classical bzds bind equally well to
gabaars containing all of the r subunit isoforms except r4
and r6.8,9 in contrast, zpm has high affinity for receptors
containing the r1 subunit, low affinity for r2- and r3-containing
receptors, and no significant affinity for r5-containing receptors
(table 1).8-10 the sedative actions of bzds have been shown
to be mediated by r1-containing gabaars, whereas  xxxd1459xxx 
effects such as anxiolysis are mediated by other r subunit
isoforms.11 this helps explain why zpm is useful as a sedative/
hypnotic but is not a clinically efficacious anxiolytic, whereas
classical bzds such as diazepam are effective at treating anxiety
but their use is accompanied by a myriad of adverse side effects.
interestingly, the non- xxxd1459xxx  esz (and its racemate zopiclone)
has similar affinity for gabaars containing r1, r2, r3, and
r5 subunits (table 1)10,12 and yet when taken for extended
periods does not induce the adverse side effects associated with
classical  xxxd1459xxx  treatment.6 thus, the neuropharmacological
properties of esz must stem from more than just r-subunit
selectivity.
the  xxxd1459xxx  binding site is located on the extracellular surface
of the gabaar at the interface of the r and gamma subunits and is
formed by residues located in at least six noncontiguous regions
(historically designated loops a-f) (figure 1).13 although
several studies have made significant strides in uncovering the
specific amino acid residues that contribute to the binding of
classical bzds (e.g., flunitrazepam and diazepam) (figure 1),13
complete descriptions of the residues that preferentially contribute to the binding of non- xxxd1459xxx  ligands and the orientation
of these ligands within the  xxxd1459xxx  site are relatively unknown.
in this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis, radioligand
binding, and molecular docking to compare the structural
requirements for zpm and esz binding to r1-containing
gabaars. we found that residues in gamma2loop d and r1loops a
and b are important for maintaining the overall structural

integrity of the binding pocket whereas residues in gamma2loop e
and r1loop c are important for ligand selectivity. molecular
docking is in good agreement with the binding data and suggests
that unlike esz, zpm binding relies more on the overall shape
of the binding pocket than on specific residue interactions within
the  xxxd1459xxx  site.
results
effects of  xxxd1459xxx -site mutations on [3h]ro15-1788 binding
affinity. several residues that contribute to the binding of  xxxd1459xxx 
ligands have previously been identified (figure 1e). on the r
subunit these residues include h101 (loop a);8,14-19  xxxg157xxx ,
y159, t162 (loop b);8,15,20,21 and g200, v202, s204, s205,

t206, y209, and v211 (loop c).8,15,20-28 on the  xxxg218xxx  these
include  xxxd926xxx , a79, t81 (loop d)16,22,29-33 and  xxxg374xxx  (loop
e).22,34
to help elucidate the unique structural requirements for esz
and zpm binding, 24 single cysteine mutations (12 each in the
r1 and  xxxg842xxx  subunits) were made in or near the  xxxd1459xxx  binding site
in the gabaar (figure 1e). these included all of the sites
mentioned above with the exception of two residues and some
new sites. we did not mutate r1h101, as it has already been
shown to contribute to the high affinity binding of both zopiclone
and zpm,8,14,17 and r1y159, because serine and cysteine
substitutions at this site abolish [3h]ro15-1788 and [3h]flunitrazepam binding, thereby precluding further  xxxd1459xxx  affinity
measurements.15,20
the mutant subunits were coexpressed with wild-type (wt)
subunits in hek293t cells to form r1beta2gamma2 gabaars, and the
binding of the  xxxd1459xxx -site antagonist [3h]ro15-1788 (figure 1d)
was measured. the majority of mutant receptors bound ro151788 with similar affinity as wt receptors (ki ) 3.3 ( 1.3
nm) (table 2). seven mutations caused small but significant
decreases (2.0- to 4.5-fold) in ro15-1788 affinity, whereas one
mutation, r1g157c, increased the affinity over 17-fold (table
2). for three mutant receptors (r1beta2gamma2f77c, r1d97cbeta2gamma2, and
r1y209cbeta2gamma2) specific binding of [3h]ro15-1788 or the bzdsite agonist [3h]flunitrazepam (figure 1d) was not measurable
(data not shown), precluding any further examination.

figure 2. cysteine mutations in the benzodiazepine binding site
differentially affect  xxxd2047xxx  and zolpidem affinity for the gabaa

and r1 mutant (loops a-c) receptors for esz (light bars) and zpm
(dark bars) is graphed and was measured as described in the experiemental section. x161 is the gamma/r chimera where residues n-terminal
to 161 are  xxxg842xxx  sequence and residues c-terminal to 161 are r1 sequence.
bars represent mean ( sd of at least three independent experiments.
values significantly different from wt are indicated (/, p < 0.05; //,
p < 0.01).

significantly reduced both esz and zpm affinity (∼8- to 9-fold)
compared to wt receptors (kiesz ) 50.1 ( 10.1 nm; kizpm )
61.9 ( 7.3 nm), whereas gamma2t81c located adjacent to gamma2a79
had a small but significant effect on zpm but not esz binding
(figures 2 and 3a, table 2). gamma2d56c on the neighboring beta-strand
(figure 3a) had no effect on the binding of either drug (figure
2, table 2).

gamma2loop e of the  xxxd1459xxx  binding site is composed of two
adjacent beta-strands (5/6) that form the back and side of the  xxxd1459xxx 
binding pocket (figure 1c). several mutations in the middle of
these beta-strands differentially affected esz and zpm binding
(figures 2 and 3b, table 2). whereas cysteine substitution of
gamma2m130 and gamma2r132 each decreased esz affinity by ∼2-fold,
these mutations increased zpm affinity by ∼2- to 4-fold. while
gamma2t142c significantly reduced the affinity of both ligands, it
had a larger effect on zpm binding compared to esz (21-fold
vs 10-fold change). moreover, r1beta2gamma2r144c receptors showed
a significant reduction in esz affinity (3.5-fold) but no change
in zpm binding. gamma2t126c and gamma2l140c, located at the periphery
of the  xxxd1459xxx -site (figure 3b), did not affect the binding of esz
or zpm. overall, the data suggest that loop e plays an important
role in determining ligand selectivity of the  xxxd1459xxx  binding site.
loop f of the  xxxg842xxx  subunit (∼residues 182-197) is a dynamic
region of the receptor located between the  xxxd1459xxx  binding site
and the transmembrane channel domain (figure 1). through
the use of  xxxg842xxx /r1 chimeras, a portion of loop f (gamma2186-192)
was shown to be important for high affinity zpm binding.35 a
chimeric subunit, chi161 (containing  xxxg842xxx  residues up to and
including amino acid 161 and r1 residues c-terminal to 161),
when expressed with wt r1 and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  subunits, retained wt
binding affinity for flunitrazepam, but the binding affinity for
zpm decreased 8-fold. here, we used the same chimera to test
whether residues c-terminal to 161 were also important for esz
binding. we found that chi161 slightly increased (∼2-fold) the
affinity of the receptor for esz (figures 2 and 3c, table 2).
we noticed that in our homology model of the gabaar36
two arginine residues and a glutamate from loop f (gamma2r185,
gamma2r194, and gamma2e189) point toward the ligand binding pocket
(figure 3c). we individually mutated the arginine residues to
cysteine and found that the binding of ro15-1788, esz, and
zpm to gamma2r185c- and gamma2r194c-containing receptors was
indistinguishable from wt (figure 2, table 2). these data are

as described in the experiemental section, and ki values are reported in table 2. a close-up view of the benzodiazepine binding site (right panels),
with the r1 subunit in red and the  xxxg842xxx  subunit in blue, highlights all sites where individual cysteine substitutions were introduced (yellow). for x161,
residues 1-161 are  xxxg842xxx  sequence (blue), and residues c-terminal to 161 are r1 sequence (red). the localization of residues gamma2r185, gamma2e189, and
gamma2r194 is based on their positions in the wt  xxxg842xxx  sequence.

consistent with our previous study of gamma2loop f where we
demonstrated that mutations in this region (gamma2w183c, gamma2e189c,
and gamma2r197c) affect modulation of gaba current by  xxxd1459xxx 
agonists without affecting binding affinity of various  xxxd1459xxx 
ligands including zpm, ro15-1788, the classical  xxxd1459xxx ,  xxxd2140xxx , and the  xxxd1422xxx  dmcm.37 overall, these results
strongly suggest no one residue in gamma2loop f is critical for binding
classical or non-bzds.
effects of r1 subunit mutations on esz and zpm binding
affinity. in r1 loops a and b, cysteine substitution of two
residues, r1a160 and r1t162, had no significant effect on either
esz or zpm binding affinity (figure 2, table 2). in contrast,
cysteine substitution of r1f99 and r1g157 caused significant
changes in the affinity of both ligands. r1f99c reduced esz
and zpm affinity by ∼8- and 3-fold, respectively, compared to
wt receptors. r1g157c had a larger effect, with 42- and 20fold changes in esz and zpm binding affinity, respectively
(figures 2 and 4a, table 2).
cysteine substitution of several residues in r1loop c also
significantly altered the binding affinity of both ligands.
r1g200c and r1v202c reduced esz affinity by 2.4- and 5.0fold, respectively, and reduced zpm affinity 9.7- and 9.0-fold,

respectively (figures 2 and 4b, table 2). other mutations
differentially affected zpm and esz affinity. r1s204c reduced
zpm affinity by 7-fold but had no effect on esz binding,
whereas r1t206c increased esz affinity over 60-fold while
having no effect on zpm binding (figures 2 and 4b, table 2).
receptors containing r1s205c and r1v211c bound both
ligands with wt affinity. these results suggest that together
with gamma2loop e, r1loop c is an important determinant for bzdsite ligand selectivity.
molecular docking of  xxxd2047xxx  and zolpidem. independent of the radioligand binding experiments described above,
we used our homology model of the gabaar to dock esz
and zpm into the  xxxd1459xxx  binding site. esz docking yielded a
single most populated pose with low energy (-6.61 kcal/mol).
in this pose (termed esz-dock), the free carbonyl of esz is
pointed up toward loop c and the ring carbonyl is near gamma2r144
(loop e) and r1h101 (loop a) near the base of the pocket
(figures 5a and 6a). in contrast, zpm docking yielded three
equally populated poses with similar energies (between -7.0
and -6.7 kcal/mol): one with the imidazopyridine ring under
r1loop c, the carbonyl pointed up toward the tip of r1loop c
and the dimethyl amide pointed toward gamma2loop d (zpm-up-

the pocket, the carbonyl pointed down away from r1loop c
and the dimethyl amide positioned under the tip of r1loop c
(zpm-out-dock) (figure 5d).
to gain insight into the potential interactions between esz
or zpm and the gabaar in our docked ligand-receptor
complexes, we measured the distance between atoms in each
ligand and atoms in the protein, with the idea that functional
groups separated by less than 7 å have the potential to interact38
and those within 4 å may form salt bridges or hydrogen bonds.39
in esz-dock, residues gamma2f77, gamma2a79, gamma2t142, gamma2r144, r1h101,
r1y159, r1t206, and r1y209 all come within 4 å of the ligand
(figures 5a and 6a) and, when mutated, alter esz binding (table
2) and/or  xxxd1459xxx  binding in general. in this docking, potential
polar contacts exist between esz and gamma2r144, r1y159, r1s204,
r1y209, and the backbone of r1loop c (shown as dashed lines
in figures 5a and 6a). in addition, residues r1f99, r1v202,
gamma2m130, and gamma2r132, which when mutated all adversely affect
esz binding (table 2), are all within 7 å of esz in our model.
for zpm, the three poses are similar in that residues including
gamma2f77, gamma2m130, gamma2t142, r1h101, r1y159, r1s204, and r1y209
all come within 5 å of the ligand in each case (figures 5 and
6b). likewise, residues r1f99, r1v202, gamma2a79, and gamma2r132
are within ∼7 å or less from zpm in each model. thus, even
though the free carbonyl of zpm is oriented differently in each
pose, the space occupied by zpm within the binding pocket is
similar. the major difference between the three models lies in
the potential for hydrogen bonding. in zpm-up-dock, potential
hydrogen bonds exist between zpm and the backbone of loop
c near r1t206/ xxxg207xxx ; in zpm-down-dock, the free carbonyl
may form a hydrogen bond with r1s204 in loop c; and in zpm-

out-dock the carbonyl may interact with gamma2r194 in loop f
(dashed lines, figures 5 and 6b).
discussion
although several studies have revealed important information
on the amino acid side chains that contribute to classical  xxxd1459xxx 
binding in the gabaar, a complete description of the residues
that participate in non- xxxd1459xxx  binding has been lacking. residues
previously shown to participate in zpm binding include gamma2f77,
gamma2m130, r1h101, r1t162, r1g200, r1s204, r1t206, r1y209,
and r1v211.8,14,21-25,28,32-34 to our knowledge, only one site,
r1h101, has been identified that is important for zopiclone (the
racemate of esz) binding.17 here, we define receptor models
for how esz and zpm are oriented in the binding site, evaluate
how specific residues in the binding site interact with esz and
zpm, and provide new insight into the pharmacophores for these
drugs.
residues in loops a, b, and d are critical for the overall
structure of the  xxxd1459xxx  site. several lines of evidence suggest
that residues in gamma2loop d and r1loops a and b are critical to
the binding of bzds in general and thus are important for the
overall structure of the  xxxd1459xxx  binding site. mutations in these
areas affect the binding affinities of a variety of structurally
diverse  xxxd1459xxx -site ligands. in gamma2loop d, we were unable to detect
specific binding of  xxxd1459xxx  antagonist [3h]ro15-1788 or the  xxxd1459xxx 
agonist [3h] flunitrazepam to f77c-containing receptors, suggesting that the native phenylalanine at this position is a key
structural element in the  xxxd1459xxx  binding pocket. this is consistent
with previous findings that showed that a variety of substitutions
at gamma2f77 dramatically alter the affinity of various bzds
including ro15-1788, diazepam, flunitrazepam, and zpm,22,32,33
and where gamma2f77c was shown to completely abolish  xxxd2140xxx 
potentiation.29
moreover, we found that mutation gamma2a79c reduced the
binding of esz and zpm to a similar extent (∼8- to 9-fold)

(figure 2) and the affinity of the receptor for ro15-1788 was
also significantly decreased (table 2). previous studies found
mutation of gamma2a79 was also detrimental to flunitrazepam, ro154513, ro15-1788, and diazepam binding.16,30,31 these results
are in good agreement with cysteine accessibility studies that
showed gamma2a79 is part of the  xxxd1459xxx  binding pocket.29,30
cysteine substitution of gamma2t81 had no effect on esz or ro151788 and only a minor effect on zpm affinity (<2-fold) (table
2). however, larger volume  xxxd1459xxx -site ligands such as ro154513, ro40-6129, and ro41-3380 are affected by mutations at

this site.30 thus, even though gamma2t81 may not contribute
significantly to esz or zpm binding, it likely forms part of the
binding site for other bzds.
in r1loop a, we observed no specific binding of [3h]ro151788 or [3h]flunitrazepam to r1d97cbeta2gamma2 receptors. functional
r1d97cbeta2gamma2 receptors that respond to gaba can be expressed
in xenopus oocytes.40 thus, it is unlikely that cysteine substitution at this location impairs proper folding or expression of the
receptor. molecular docking indicates that r1d97 is within 8
å of esz and zpm. in our model, r1d97 appears part of an

electrostatic network of residues that bridges the r1/ xxxg842xxx  subunit
interface. we speculate that the lack of specific binding for this
mutant is because r1d97 is important for maintaining the
structural integrity of the  xxxd1459xxx  pocket.
mutation of r1f99 in loop a significantly reduces gabaar
affinity for esz, zpm, and ro15-1788. this may be because
r1f99 participates in hydrophobic interactions with bound drug
or because mutation of r1f99 to cysteine alters the positions
of r1h101 (loop a) and r1y159 (loop b), which lie on either
side of it in the binding pocket (figure 5). indeed, the necessity
of r1h101 in binding zpm,8,14 zopiclone,17 and several other
bzds16,18,19 has been established. the importance of r1y159
is underscored by its potential to hydrogen-bond directly with
esz in the binding pocket (figure 5) and the inability of
[3h]ro15-1788 or [3h]flunitrazepam to bind r1y159c- or
r1y159s-containing receptors.15,20
one of the most dramatic shifts in  xxxd1459xxx  binding affinity was
measured for the r1loop b mutant g157c. this residue appears
to be at the side wall of the esz and zpm binding pocket
(figure 5). in our homology model of the gabaar, a larger
cysteine side chain would decrease the volume of the binding
site. this may hinder occupation of the site by zpm and esz

and/or affect the positioning of nearby residues including
r1h101 (loop a) and r1y209 (loop c) (figure 5). the fact
that g157c drastically reduces zpm and esz binding (figure
2, table 2) but increases ro15-1788 affinity 17-fold supports
the idea that g157c alters the shape of the  xxxd1459xxx  binding pocket
and that imidazobenzodiazepines (i-bzds) such as ro15-1788
have different structural requirements than the non-bzds.
indeed, a recent study showed that a sulfhydryl-reactive
derivative of the i- xxxd1459xxx , ro15-4513, was able to covalently
attach to a cysteine at r1g157.15
since mutation of residues in gamma2loopd and r1loops a and b
alter the binding affinity of a variety of structurally diverse bzdsite ligands (our work and others), we envision that these regions
define the core of the binding site for  xxxd1459xxx -site ligands. thus,
a question remains as to what defines ligand specificity at the
 xxxd1459xxx  binding site.
residues in loops c and e determine ligand selectivity
at the  xxxd1459xxx  site. unlike residues in loops a, b, and d, gamma2loop
e residues are located at the back of the binding pocket where
extra space exists for ligand placement/movement (figure 6c,
right panel). the large unfilled volume bordered by loop e is
likely ideal for accommodating ligands of different size and

chemical composition. indeed, we found that mutations m130c,
r132c, and r144c in gamma2loop e differentially affect esz, zpm,
and ro15-1788 affinity (table 2, figure 2). in addition, the
magnitude of the effect of the t142c mutation was different
for all three ligands tested. interestingly, previous studies have
shown that mutation of gamma2m130 to leucine reduces zpm affinity
while having very small or no effects on the binding of several
other bzds.22,34 thus, substitution of native loop e residues
may cause a change in the volume of the binding site that results
in altered positioning of the ligand in the pocket, thereby
affecting affinity. for example, molecular docking shows that
the native arginine at position 144 stabilizes the ring carbonyl
of esz in the binding pocket via a hydrogen bond (figure 5);
thus, removal of this h-bond via cysteine substitution likely
causes the observed reduction in esz affinity. in contrast, zpm
dockings show no interaction with gamma2r144, explaining the lack
of effect of gamma2r144c on zpm binding.
mutations in r1loop c also differentially affect ligand binding
to the  xxxd1459xxx -site of the gabaar (figure 2), suggesting that
these residues also play a role in determining ligand selectivity.
we found that three mutations, g200c, v202c, and s204c,
had a much greater effect on zpm affinity than esz or ro151788, whereas t206c dramatically increased esz affinity
without affecting zpm or ro15-1788 (figure 2, table 2). in
addition, previous studies have shown that mutations t206v
and t206a selectively alter the affinity of diazepam, flunitrazepam, and zpm but not that of several other bzds.22,25
on the basis of the low sequence homology of r1loop c to
other r subunit isoforms (figure 1e), loop c is likely a
significant determinant in the r1-subunit selectivity of zpm.
this is supported by previous studies. first, replacement of
r1g200 with the aligned glutamate residue present in all other
r subunit isoforms reduces zpm binding,23 whereas replacement
of the glutamate in r3, r5, and r6 with glycine increases the
affinity of these receptors for zpm.8,21,24 second, replacement
of the threonine in r5 with the aligned serine at 204 in r1
increases the affinity of r5 for zpm.21 lastly, mutation of
r1v211 to the aligned isoleucine in r5 and r6 decreases
flunitrazepam and zpm affinity while increasing the affinity of
r5-selective ligands.28 all of these substitutions show that
r1loop c residues promote zpm binding whereas loop c
residues from other r subunit isoforms reduce zpm affinity,
supporting the idea that r1loop c contributes to zpm selectivity.
loop c residues r1val211, r1val202, and r1ser205 also
appear to be especially important for i- xxxd1459xxx  binding. a
sulfhydryl-reactive derivative of ro15-4513 has been shown
to covalently attach to r1v202c and r1v211c,15 whereas
r1s205c reduced the affinity for ro15-1788 (table 2), and
replacement of r1s205 with the aligned asparagine in r6 was
shown to decrease the affinity of i-bzds and beta-carbolines.27
of the cysteine substitutions at these sites, only r1v202c had
an effect on esz and zpm binding (figure 2, table 2). overall,
mutations in gamma2loop e and r1loop c differentially affect binding
of structurally diverse classes of  xxxd1459xxx -site ligands, supporting
the idea that these regions define specificity.
zolpidem interaction with the  xxxd1459xxx  site is less specific
than  xxxd2047xxx . the orientation of esz in the  xxxd1459xxx  binding
pocket as presented in figures 5 and 6 is supported by our
mutagenesis data. this docking was the lowest energy, most
highly populated pose obtained using autodock 4.0. a similar
orientation of esz was observed using autodock 3.0 and
sureflex dock (data not shown), and the docking is consistent
with the recently described unified pharmacophore/receptor
model of the  xxxd1459xxx  site.41 essential functional groups defining

hanson et al.

the esz pharmacophore and its orientation in the site are its
two carbonyls, which hydrogen-bond with the backbone of loop
c and gamma2r144 (loop e), respectively, and two ring nitrogens,
which hydrogen-bond with r1s204 (loop c) and r1y159 (loop
b), respectively (figure 6).
in contrast, zpm may bind in multiple orientations in the
 xxxd1459xxx  site. our molecular docking revealed three equally
populated poses with equivalent energies that occupy a similar
space within the  xxxd1459xxx  site (figures 5 and 6) but with few
potential polar contacts in any orientation. thus, the essential
descriptor of the zpm pharmacophore is likely its size and
shape. zpm has only a single carbonyl, which appears capable
of interacting with several different residues in the  xxxd1459xxx  binding
site (figure 5). we found that this carbonyl could hydrogenbond with r1loop c (at r1s204 or the backbone near r1t206/
 xxxg207xxx ) or with gamma2loop f (arg194) (figure 5). similar orientations
were observed with autodock 3.0 and sureflex dock software
(data not shown). our zpm-up-dock pose is similar to that
reported by sancar et al., which allowed flexible movement of
the side chains during docking.35 while our mutagenesis data
would favor hydrogen bonding with r1s204, we cannot exclude
any of the poses presented here. overall, we believe that unlike
esz, zpm binding relies more on shape recognition of the
binding pocket than on specific interactions in the  xxxd1459xxx  site.
this would explain several observations:
first, this would account for the r1 subunit selectivity of zpm
(table 1).8-10,42,43 the included volume of the  xxxd1459xxx  binding
pocket for r1-containing receptors has a slightly different shape,
polarity, and lipophilicity compared to r2- and r3-containing
receptors,41 explaining the reduced but still measurable affinity
of zpm for r2 and r3 (table 1). furthermore, the included
volume of r1-containing receptors is much larger than r4-, r5-,
and r6-containing receptors,41 thus explaining the lack of zpm
binding at these r subtypes (table 1). it follows that differences
in the included volumes of the  xxxd1459xxx -site for  xxxg842xxx - versus  xxxg841xxx - and
 xxxg843xxx -containing receptors also likely play a role in zpm selectivity.
second, this clarifies why chi161, but not specific mutations
in loop f, specifically reduces zpm binding (table 2). the
replacement of the entire gamma2loop f, which is poorly conserved,
with the r1loop f that is also two amino acids longer, likely
changes the size of the binding pocket to the detriment of zpm
binding.
third, shape recognition by zpm would explain why minor
mutations in loop c, like r1g200c, r1v202c, and r1s204c,
affect zpm binding to a much greater extent than esz (figure
2). loop c, which comprises the entire lid over of the  xxxd1459xxx 
site (figure 6c), is highly flexible and is believed to move upon
ligand binding.44-46 thus, it stands to reason that mutation of
r1g200, located at the hinge of loop c (figure 5), would change
the overall flexibility of the loop, perhaps preventing its full
closure on the binding site, resulting in an altered shape of the
binding pocket, which in turn precludes high affinity zpm
binding. in contrast, esz, which is anchored to the  xxxd1459xxx  site
by multiple interactions (e.g., arg144, tyr209, tyr159, etc.)
(figure 6a), is less affected by any single mutation.
overall, this evidence suggests that zpm binding depends
largely on the size and shape of the  xxxd1459xxx  binding pocket rather
than on specific polar interactions.
summary and conclusions
in summary, our data provide new insights toward defining
the pharmacophore for non- xxxd1459xxx  hypnotics as well as the
structure of the  xxxd1459xxx  binding site (figure 6). we provide a
comprehensive description of the amino acid residues that

 xxxd2047xxx  and zolpidem binding

contribute to the binding of these ligands and present molecular
models for their orientation in the  xxxd1459xxx  binding site. we show
that residues in gamma2loop d and r1loops a and b provide the
necessary framework for ligand binding in the pocket, while
specific residues in gamma2loop e and r1loop c play a key role in
determining ligand selectivity. we conclude that gamma2loop f does
not directly contribute to  xxxd1459xxx  binding but may serve indirectly
to maintain the structural integrity of the region. we also provide
evidence that the subunit selectivity of zpm results mainly from
the overall shape of the binding pocket and is based largely on
its interaction with loop c.
thus, their footprint within the  xxxd1459xxx  binding pocket of the
gabaar may in part determine the pharmacological properties
of the non-bzds. further experiments will be necessary to
determine if specific residues in loops c and e differentiate the
efficacies of the classical and non- xxxd1459xxx  ligands. the identification of the structural elements important for the high affinity
binding and efficacy of these drugs provides insight into the
unique neuropharmacological profile of esz and zpm in the
central nervous system and will be beneficial in the design and
development of more pharmacologically and behaviorally
selective  xxxd1459xxx  site ligands.

radioligand binding. hek293t cells were grown in minimum
essential medium with earle’s salts (invitrogen, grand island, ny)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °c incubator under 5%
co2 atmosphere. cells were plated on 100 mm dishes at ∼40%
confluency47 for transient transfection using a standard cahpo4
precipitation method.48 cells were transfected with equal ratios of
r, beta, and  xxxg218xxx  dna in the same vector (4 µg/subunit). for
experiments involving cysteine mutants and wt r1beta2gamma2 receptors,
cells were co-transfected with wt puniv-r1, puniv- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , punivgamma2 l, or mutant subunit cdna. for expression of r2beta2gamma2, r3beta2gamma2,
and r6beta2gamma2 receptors, cells were co-transfected with  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -prk5 and
 xxxg842xxx -prk5 and either r2-prk5, r3-prk5, or r6-prk5 (constructs
kindly provided by s. dunn (department of pharmacology,
university of alberta, edmonton, canada)). for expression of
r4beta2gamma2 and r5beta2gamma2 receptors, cells were co-transfected with r4puniv,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -puniv, and  xxxg842xxx -puniv or r5-pcep4,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -pcep4, and
 xxxg842xxx -pcep4 cdna, respectively. cells were harvested and membrane
homogenates prepared 48 h post-transfection as described.49 briefly,
membrane homogenates (50 µg) were incubated at room temperature for 40 min with a sub-kd concentration of radioligand
([3h]ro15-1788, 70.7ci/mmol; [3h]flunitrazepam, 85.2 ci/mmol;
[3h]ro15-4513, 35.7 ci/mmol; perkinelmer life and analytical
sciences, boston, ma) in the absence or presence of seven different
concentrations of unlabeled ligand in a final volume of 250 µl.
data were fit by nonlinear regression to a one-site competition curve
defined by the equation y ) bmax/[1 + (x/ic50)], where y is bound
[3h]ligand in disintegrations per minute, bmax is maximal binding,
x is the concentration of displacing ligand, and ic50 is the
concentration of unlabeled ligand that inhibits 50% of [3h]ligand
binding (prism, graphpad software). equilibrium dissociation
constant values for the unlabeled ligand (ki) were calculated using
the cheng-prusoff-chou equation: ki )ic50/[1 + l/kd], where
kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the radioligand and
l is the concentration of the radioligand.
statistical analysis. binding data represent the mean ( sd from
three experiments performed in triplicate. the data were analyzed
by one-way anova with dunnett’s post-test for significance of
differences (statview, version 5.0.1, sas institute, inc., cary, nc).
automated ligand docking. the homology model of the
gabaar used in this study was constructed as described.36 esz
and zpm were built using sybyl modeling software (tripos corp.,

journal of medicinal chemistry, 2008, vol. 51, no. 22 7251

st. louis, mo). each of the drug structures were energy-minimized
using the tripos force field, and then a random search was
performed for the lowest energy conformations. the single lowest
energy form was placed in the gabaar r1/ xxxg842xxx  interface using
sybyl, and a 15 å sphere of residues around the ligand was chosen
as the starting active site. the active site was set up for docking
using autodock 4.0 tools, placing gatseiger charges and desolvation parameters on the chosen 15 å receptor sphere. autodock
450,51 parameters were chosen for the genetic algorithm (ga) to
examine 150 individuals in a population with a maximum of 5
million energy evaluations, followed by 300 iterations of solis &
wets local search (lakmarkian algorithm). a total of 10 to 30 of
these hybrid dockings were performed on each drug. the binding
results were clustered on the basis of lowest energy, visual
similarities, and the orientation in the active site. the reported
binding energies in kcal/mol is the sum of the final intermolecular
energy, the internal energy of the ligand, and the torsional free
energy minus the unbound systems energy. the orientation with
stronger binding has the lower total energy, and the cluster of
highest number of bindings represents a higher probability of
binding. the drug was allowed to flexibly dock, but the receptor’s
backbone and side chains remained rigid during docking. each
docking gave an ensemble of docking modes, with many orientations nearly identical and only differing by less than 0.1 kcal/mol.
