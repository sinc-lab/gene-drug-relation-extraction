abstract
patients with seasonal or allergic
bronchial asthma experience an immediate allergic response caused by allergenspecific immunoglobulin e-mediated histamine release. the release of histamine
and other chemical mediators may trigger
airway hyperresponsiveness and exaggerated bronchoconstriction, characteristic
features of allergic bronchial asthma. traditional antihistamines have demonstrated
only moderate activity of short duration
against this disease. in contrast, loratadine, a potent, nonsedating, histamine1-receptor antagonist with activity in seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, has
demonstrated effective control of asthma
symptoms, improved pulmonary function,
and long duration of action in patients
1278

with allergic bronchial asthma. this review summarizes preclinical evidence for
the antiauergic activity of loratadine and
the results of clinical studies with oral loratadine in patients with allergic bronchial
asthma. key words: loratadine, antihistamine, asthma, allergic bronchial asthma.
introduction
until recently, the use of traditional antihistamines for the treatment of patients
with allergic bronchial asthma (aba)
achieved mixed results, in part because of
the multiple cellular interactions stemruing from the release of mediators other
than histamine from mast cells.1 the traditional histamine-1 (h1) antihistamines
(eg, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine,
and hydroxyzine) generally have little ef0149-2918/97/$3.50

fect on airway responses at pharmacologic doses, and the use of higher doses to
obtain beneficial effects is limited by the
associated side effects. these drugs penetrate the blood-brain barrier, causing central nervous system effects such as drowsiness and impairment of cognitive
function. 2,3 in addition, the traditional antihistamines have considerable anticholinergic activity, resulting in dryness of
the mouth, eyes, and bronchial mucosa
and causing agitation and restlessness in
some patients. 2
histamine has long been considered the
major mediator of allergic reactions. in
aba, histamine acts as a bronchoactive
and vasoactive mediator that contributes to
bronchoconstriction by contracting airway
smooth muscle and causing arteriolar dilatation and increased postcapillary venule
permeability.4 the acute bronchoconstrictor response to histamine is mediated by
both direct (80%) and reflex (20%) actions
that involve h 1 receptors located on airway smooth muscle and afferent vagal
nerves: spontaneous histamine release is
enhanced in asthmatic patients compared
with healthy subjects, and asthmatic patients who receive pharmacologic treatment exhibit lower histamine levels than
those who receive no treatment.6
a characteristic feature of aba is hyperresponsiveness of the airways and exaggerated bronchoconstrictor response, 7
especially after exposure to seasonal allergens. the major component of airway
hyperresponsiveness in aba is believed
to be both acquired and reversible and is
most likely the consequence of an inflammatory response of the airway epithelium and submucosa (figure 1).5,8 in
patients with aba, mucosal mast cells in
the airways are believed to be the principal source of histamine. in addition to

the allergen-specific immunoglobulin e
(ige)-mediated histamine release that is
responsible for immediate allergic responses, chemical mediators such as
leukotrienes, prostaglandins, bradykinin,
and  xxxd2973xxx  are also released. cellular interactions mediated by
these substances contribute to the bronchoconstriction and late-phase inflammatory responses experienced by patients
with aba. 9 both the number of mast
cells 1° and their responsiveness to secretory stimuli 11 are increased in patients
with asthma. in addition, elevated plasma
histamine levels during acute exacerbations of asthma have been demonstrated
to be consistent with increased mast-cell
degranulation. 12,13
with the recent introduction of a new
generation of antihistamines that are pharmacologically different from the earlier
h 1 antagonists, there has been renewed
interest in the role of these agents against
inhaled histamine- and antigen-induced
bronchospasm 14-17 and in the treatment of
patients with aba. 5'18 these newer agents
do not appreciably penetrate the bloodbrain barrier and are therefore nonsedating. loratadine, a member of the secondgeneration hi-antagonist antihistamines,
is a potent, long-acting, nonsedating, peripherally acting h 1 antagonist (figure 2)
that has been used successfully in treating
allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and allergic skin diseases. in addition to its h:antihistaminic activity, loratadine has demonstrated antiallergic
activity against other mediators involved
in the asthmatic response. 1,9 this article
reviews recent clinical studies that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of orally administered loratadine in the treatment of
patients with aba and discusses the clinical relevance of these data.

a n t i a l l e r g i c activity of
loratadine: preclinical
evidence
a number of studies have investigated the
ability of loratadine to inhibit release of
histamine and other allergic mediators from
challenged cells. 19-23 micromolar concentrations of loratadine successfully inhibited
histamine release induced by concanavalin
a (cona), calcium ionophore a23187, and
compound 48/80 from rodent peritoneal
and serosal mast cells and mc9 cultured
mast cells. 21-23 loratadine and its active
metabolite,  xxxd1846xxx  (dcl),
inhibited histamine release from ige-sensitized rat basophilic leukemia cells follow1280

ing antigen exposure. 19loratadine concentrations up to 100 ~mol/dl also significantly inhibited biosynthesis of leukotrienes c 4, d4, and e 4 in rat basophilic
leukemia cells23 and release of leukotriene
c 1 from cona-stimulated mc9 cells.21
because calcium plays an important
role in histamine release from mast cells,
the effect of loratadine on intracellular
calcium concentrations was investigated.
at concentrations >10 i~mol/dl, loratadine significantly inhibited cytosolic calcium uptake into rat peritoneal mast cells
induced by calcium ionophore a23187 or
by compound 4 8 / 8 0 . 23 antigen-induced
increases in intracellular calcium in sensitized rat basophilic leukemia cells  xxxd2360xxx

(rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells) were inhibited by the
same doses (2.5 to 25 ixmol) of loratadine
and dcl that have been shown to inhibit
histamine release. 19 recent studies have
demonstrated that loratadine and dcl
cause discharge of intracellular calcium
stores, thus increasing calcium in many
cells and rendering them nonresponsive
to subsequent agonist exposure. 24 it has
also been suggested that loratadine and
dcl might have an effect on membrane
channels because they inhibit antigeninduced mn 2+ influx in rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells. 19
oral doses of loratadine (5 to 20 mg/kg)
significantly inhibited the release of histamine and ltd 4 in lung tissues from
guinea pigs. 23 another study demonstrated that loratadine (0.3 mg/d for 3
weeks) significantly inhibited degranulation of collagen mast cells compared with
control animals. 25 in vivo studies in
guinea pigs demonstrated that loratadine
inhibits histamine-, serotonin-, and antigen-induced bronchospasm, as well as histamine- and antigen-induced airway resistance, in a dose-dependent manner. 21,23,26
similarly, loratadine significantly inhibited increases in airway resistance and decreases in airway compliance after allergic anaphylaxis in rats. 21 these airway

changes have been linked to increases in
vascular permeability and subsequent
leaking of plasma into the mucosal interstitium and the airway.26
in studies using isolated human mast
cells and basophils, loratadine and dcl
inhibited the release of early-phase allergic mediators induced by ige-dependent
stimuli (ie, allergen, anti-ige antibody,
and cona) and ige-independent stimuli
(calcium ionophore a23187). 27-31 in addition, loratadine and dcl inhibited expression of a number of late-phase mediators (human leukocyte antigen dr,
 xxxg1127xxx ,  xxxg1181xxx  and 8,  xxxg2049xxx , thromboxane
b2, cd23, and ltb4).32-38although loratadine has demonstrated inhibitory activity against a variety of allergic mediators
in animal and human cells and tissues,
neither the mechanism of this inhibition
nor the clinical relevance of these observations has been fully defined.

all cases, loratadine had a positive effect
in patients with asthma.
histamine-challenge studies produced
encouraging results in support of the clinical use of loratadine in the treatment of
patients with bronchial asthma. 14,39 in a
single-masked pilot study, 14 the protective effect of loratadine against histamineinduced bronchoconstriction was assessed
in six patients with chronic obstructive
airway disease and documented bronchial
hyperreactivity. the patients were subjected to two bronchial-provocation tests
(bpts) with identical histamine doses.
the first bpt was performed without premedication, and the second was performed
following treatment with loratadine 10
mg/d for 3 days. in five of the six patients, loratadine provided complete protection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. the mean decrease in
forced expiratory volume in 1 second
(fev 1) after inhalation of histamine was
33% without premedication, compared
with 3.3% after treatment with loratadine
(p < 0.005).
the second study, by debelic and neumann, 14 was a randomized, doublemasked, placebo-controlled, crossover
study. sixteen patients with aba and
chronic obstructive (asthmatic) bronchitis
were subjected to three standardized bpts
with inhaled histamine. the first bpt was
performed without premedication; the second and third bpts were performed after
pretreatment with either loratadine 10
mg/d or identical placebo for 4 days.
there was a 1-week washout period between loratadine and placebo treatments.
the test criterion was the maximum de-

crease in fev 1 determined from measurements obtained 1, 3, and 5 minutes
after histamine inhalation.
pretreatment with loratadine resulted in
a significantly smaller decrease in maximum fev 1 compared with placebo in the
16 study patients (p < 0.05), as well as in
a subpopulation of 12 patients who were
more homogeneous in terms of bronchial
hyperreactivity (p < 0.05). pooled data
analysis demonstrated a 16% decrease in
fev 1 with loratadine treatment, compared
with a 40% decrease with placebo treatment (p < 0.05 on a t test for bound measurements). these results demonstrated
that treatment with loratadine for 3 days
effectively inhibited histamine-induced
bronchoconstriction. 14
a double-masked, placebo-controlled,
crossover study in 17 patients with endogenous or perennial allergic asthma
compared the effect of loratadine 10 mg
once daily with that of placebo against inhaled histamine challenge. 39 each of the
two treatment periods began with a 2week run-in period followed by an 8-week
treatment period with either loratadine or
placebo. during the run-in period, it was
made certain that asthma stabilized with
the use of an inhaled steroid. during the
8-week treatment period, the dose of inhaled steroid was gradually tapered according to a fixed schedule. inhaled salbutamol was supplied to each patient for use
as rescue medication. loratadine treatment resulted in changes in all symptom
scores (nocturnal asthma, wheezing, dyspnea, coughing, and sputum production),
lung function, and use of rescue medication (p > 0.05). there was a significant,
nearly threefold decrease (95% ci for histamine pc20 = 1.8-4.8) in bronchial sensitivity to histamine during loratadine
treatment compared with placebo (p <
1283

clinical therapeutics*

0.01). these data demonstrated that
bronchial response to histamine could be
attenuated by loratadine, pointing the way
for recent clinical studies with loratadine
in the treatment of patients with bronchial
asthma.
the duration of effect of loratadine on
bronchial reactivity to histamine was compared with that of terfenadine in adult
asthmatic patients in a parallel, singlemasked, 7-day study. 4° twenty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive
loratadine (9 patients), terfenadine (8 patients), and placebo (7 patients). baseline
inhaled reactivity to histamine pc20 was
obtained for each patient on 3 consecutive
days prior to administration of study medication. during the 1-week treatment period, loratadine (10 mg), terfenadine (120
mg), and placebo were administered once
dally. at the end of the treatment period,
the histamine test was repeated on the last
day of medication and then weekly until
pc20 values returned to the mean of the
pc20 values obtained on the 3 baseline
days. nineteen (79%) of the 24 patients
used inhaled steroids at constant doses
throughout the study.
the mean duration of blocking effect
on pc20 was 8.5 days for loratadine and
7.2 days for terfenadine, compared with
no significant blocking effect for placebo.
the difference in duration of blocking effect between loratadine and terfenadine
was not significant.
the efficacy and tolerability of loratadine as supplemental therapy with otherwise unchanged asthma medication was
investigated in two clinical studies. a double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallelgroup, dose-finding study with loratadine
was conducted in 145 patients with mildto-moderate aba. 18 all patients were established on basal medication for aba,
1284

consisting of theophylline or theophylline
derivatives, inhaled corticosteroids, or
sympathomimetics as monotherapy or
combination therapy. once established,
basal medications remained constant
throughout the study. asthma symptoms
and daily peak flow values were assessed
during a 2-week preliminary period without loratadine treatment, followed by a 6week treatment period with loratadine at
doses of 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg/d. the primary efficacy criterion was dyspnea, evaluated daily on the basis of the patient's
report. secondary efficacy criteria ineluded consumption of inhaled beta-sympathomimetics, peak flow values measured by the patient, and lung function
tested by the physician. differences between patients' quality-of-life assessments
before and after treatment were analyzed.
after 6 weeks of treatment with loratadine, no effect on dyspnea was demonstrated at a dosage of 5 rag/d; however, a
good effect was seen at a dosage of 10
rag/d, with an additional increase in effect
at 20 mg/d but little additional effect at 30
mg/d. likewise, there was no change in
use of inhaled bronchodilators at a loratadine dosage of 5 rag/d, but bronchodilator use decreased significantly  xxxd1891xxx , 20,
and 30 mg/d. peak flow values with loratadine, as measured by the patient,
demonstrated moderate increases from
placebo at all dosage levels except 5 rag/d;
values for the 10-mg/d dosage were statistically significant (p < 0.05) (figure
3). 18 there were significant increases in
fev 1 and expiratory vital capacity (vc)
 xxxd1891xxx , 20, and 30 mg/d (p < 0.05). the increase in peak expiratory flow (pef) was
not statistically significant (p = 0.0534).
patient quality-of-life scores increased
significantly with the effective loratadine
doses. adverse events were reported in 10

an 8-week, open-label trial was conducted in 25 patients with aba.1 all patients were established on basal medication for aba, including theophylline,
sympathomimetics, or inhaled corticosteroids. no change in basal medications was
permitted throughout the study. a 2-week

double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. following a 1-week
placebo washout period, 59 patients with
aba received single daily doses of either
loratadine 10 mg or placebo for 6 weeks.
symptomatic asthma was treated with basic asthma medication as needed, including inhaled beta-adrenergic or corticosteroid agents and oral theophylline.
patients' pulmonary function, clinical
signs and symptoms, and laboratory findings were assessed throughout the study.
reduction in the use of basic asthma therapy while using loratadine as adjuvant
treatment was also evaluated. depending
on the improvement in lung function and
associated clinical signs and symptoms,
each patient's basic asthma therapy was
reduced in a stepwise fashion and reviewed at each visit.
1286

after 6 weeks of loratadine treatment,
all pulmonary function variables were significantly improved in the loratadinetreated patients compared with the
placebo group (p < 0.001), with the exception of pef, which was marginally significantly increased in loratadine-treated
patients (p = 0.05). all clinical signs and
symptoms (wheezing, coughing, chest
tightness, and breathlessness) demonstrated a highly statistically significant
decrease in the loratadine-treated patients
(p < 0.001). overall, 73% of the loratadine-treated patients exhibited a significant improvement, compared with 8% of
the placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001).

tients. both the number of puffs of inhaled bronchodilators and the daily dose
of bronchospasmolytic drugs were reduced. the percentage of loratadinetreated patients who either reduced their
use of basic asthma therapy by at least
50% or stopped basic therapy entirely was
significantly higher than in the placebotreated group (p < 0.001). conversely, the
number of placebo-treated patients who
did not decrease their use of basic asthma
therapy was significantly higher compared
with the corresponding number of loratadine-treated patients (p < 0.001). it was
not necessary to increase any patient's
amount of basic asthma therapy during
the study.
the comparative efficacy and safety of
loratadine and terfenadine were investigated in a randomized, double-masked,
parallel-group study.42 one hundred eighteen patients with symptomatic seasonal
allergic rhinitis (sar) of moderate severity and controlled bronchial asthma received single daily doses of either loratadine 10 mg or terfenadine 120 mg for 2
weeks during pollen season. to be eligible, patients had to be symptomatic with
confirmed sar caused by the prevailing
seasonal allergen and have documented
asthma with a baseline fev 1 >60% of
predicted value. all patients were established on basal medication for aba and
had to maintain treatment without change
throughout the 2-week study period. following initial baseline assessments, patients were evaluated for asthma and
symptoms of sar, pulmonary function
(fev 1 and pef), and global response after 3, 7, and 14 days of treatment.
at the end of the 2-week treatment period, asthma symptoms and sar scores
had decreased significantly (p < 0.01),
with no significant difference between lor-

atadine- and teffenadine-treated groups.
patients in both treatment groups experienced decreases of approximately 50% on
each of the asthma symptom scores. indicators of respiratory function (fev t and
pef) remained stable throughout the treatment period or, in a small number of patients, were slightly improved. the physicians' global evaluation of asthma at the
end of the treatment period showed 11%
and 5% decreases in severe asthma and
19% and 20% decreases in moderate
asthma in loratadine- and terfenadinetreated patients, respectively. there were
no significant changes from baseline in
laboratory values or vital signs in either
treatment group. overall, both agents
achieved effective control of sar and
symptomatic improvement of concurrent
asthma.
loratadine and ketotifen were compared in a double-masked, active-controlled study of 63 patients with documented seasonal pollen-induced asthma. 43
eligible patients had positive results on
an allergen skin test and were then randomized to treatment with either 20 mg
loratadine once daily or 1 mg ketotifen
twice daily for 6 weeks. inhaled salbutamol was allowed as needed; however, patients were not permitted to use other inhaled bronchodilators, systemic steroids,
antihistamines, theophylline and other
xanthines, or  xxxd1763xxx . patients were allowed to receive _<400 p,g/d of inhaled  xxxd294xxx  concurrently
if the dose was kept constant for the study
duration. patients were also allowed to
use nasal decongestants, nasal saline solution, ocular  xxxd1763xxx , ocular decongestants, short-acting pseudoephedrine, acetaminophen, aspirin,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and
antibiotics. patient assessments were con1287

ducted prior to the first dose of study medication and after 2, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment. during each visit, signs and symptoms of asthma were assessed, pulmonary
function tests were performed, and any
adverse events were recorded.
over the course of the study, pulmonary
function improved from baseline in both
treatment groups. fev 1 improved between 8% and 13%, and pef improved
between 17% and 38%. although the level
of improvement in pulmonary function
was greater in the loratadine-treated
group, the difference between treatment
groups was not statistically significant.
continued reduction in asthma symptoms
was observed throughout the study. after
2 weeks of treatment, there was a 36%
improvement in the loratadine-treated
group and a 47% improvement in the ketotifen-treated group. six weeks after initiation of treatment, total symptom scores
for both treatment groups had improved
by a mean of 65%. there were no statistically significant differences in improvement between the two treatment groups at
any evaluation. both treatments were well
tolerated; however, somnolence occurred
more frequently in ketotifen-treated patients than in loratadine-treated patients
(25% vs 10%, respectively). based on pulmonary function and symptom data, loratadine was as effective as ketotifen in the
treatment of patients with seasonal asthma
but was associated with less somnolence.
another study44 investigated the efficacy and tolerability of loratadine compared with  xxxd1763xxx  used
as a standard nonsteroidal prophylactic
treatment in children with mild-to-moderate asthma. one hundred twenty-two children with perennial allergic asthma were
enrolled in this randomized, doublemasked, double-dummy, parallel-group
1288

study. patients received either loratadine
(10 mg if body weight was <30 kg and 20
mg if body weight was >30 kg) or  xxxd1763xxx  four times daily, inhaled as double 5-mg puffs. during the 8week treatment period, efficacy was
assessed at the first visit and at the end of
4 and 8 weeks of treatment. efficacy criteria included asthma symptom scores,
overall assessment of asthma, pulmonary
function (fev 1 and pef), and consumption of inhaled  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -agonists.
during the 8-week treatment period,
asthma symptom scores decreased significantly for both loratadine (p = 0.002) and
 xxxd1763xxx  (p = 0.085). there
were highly significant reductions (p <
0.0001) in severity of asthma as well as in
the use of as-needed  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -agonists in both
treatment groups. pulmonary function values (fev 1 and pef) did not change in either group. no statistically significant differences between the two groups were
observed in any variable. both treatments
were well tolerated, and no changes in
blood chemistry were observed with either treatment.
a double-masked, placebo-controlled
study was conducted in 193 patients with
a history of asthma related to sar. 45 patients were randomized to receive either a
combination of 5 mg loratadine and 120
mg pseudoephedrine sulfate or placebo
twice daily for 6 weeks. rhinitis, asthma
symptoms, and pef were recorded by the
patient in the morning and evening. patients visited the clinic weekly, during
which spirometry and global evaluation
of the effects of treatment on sar and
asthma symptoms were performed. rhinitis and asthma symptoms were significantly improved (p < 0.05) in patients
treated with a combination of loratadine
and pseudoephedrine sulfate compared

j.-l. menardo et al.

with patients treated with placebo. fev 1
(p < 0.005), morning pef (p < 0.05), and
evening pef (p < 0.05) improved significantly during the course of the study.
sar symptoms were controlled during
the 6-week study period, and asthma
symptoms and pulmonary function improved significantly shortly after initiation of treatment with a combination of
 xxxd2504xxx .
discussion and conclusions
bronchial hyperresponsiveness and exaggerated bronchoconstrictor response are
well recognized as critical components of
aba. 7 in studies of histamine-induced
bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients, prophylactic treatment
with loratadine 10 mg once daily effectively inhibited histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. 14,39,40 loratadine also appeared to prevent the development of
allergic asthma associated with airway inflammation from pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis.46 these observations support the results of studies demonstrating
the selective hi-antagonist activity of loratadine in guinea pigs 21 and humans 47 and
the results of studies using other secondgeneration antihistamines. 15-17,48'49lolatadine was subsequently found to be effective in the treatment of patients with
a b a . 1'14'18'39"-42'44 furthermore, a combination of loratadine 5 mg and pseudoephedrine sulfate 120 mg administered
twice daily was effective in controlling
perennial rhinitis and associated aba. 45
several studies 1,18,41 clearly demonstrated a drug-sparing effect when loratadine 10 mg was administered once daily
as adjuvant treatment with established
standard antiasthmatic therapy, including
theophylline, sympathomimetics, and in-

haled corticosteroids. the benefit derived
from any reduction in concomitant treatment while maintaining therapeutic effect
with lolatadine is clear for several reasons: less total medication is required,
there is less potential for side effects, and
patient compliance is improved.
in comparative studies, lolatadine was
found to be as efficacious as  xxxd1763xxx ,
the reference drug in the prophylactic
treatment of patients with mild persistent
childhood asthma, and as other h 1 antihistamines, such as terfenadine and ketotifen, in adults. 4°,42"44 in addition, lolatadine is not associated with the cardiac
arrhythmias seen with other second-genelation antihistamines such as terfenadine
and  xxxd236xxx . 9,5°
traditional antihistamines have been
effective in the treatment of patients with
allergic and nonailergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, urticaria, and allergic skin disease
for many years; their usefulness for the
treatment of patients with aba, however,
has been limited because of their moderate efficacy, short duration of action, and
associated side effects, most notably sedation. 51 the ideal antihistamine for the
treatment of patients with aba should
possess a broad spectrum of activity
against allergic mediators and should
demonstrate long-term efficacy at a low
oral dose without significant side effects.
lolatadine, a second-generation antihistamine indicated for the relief of nasal and
nonnasal symptoms of seasonal allergic
rhinitis, does not produce significant side
effects and possesses additional activity
against allergic mediators other than histamine. 1,9,s° these properties have led to
investigations of the use of loratadine for
the treatment of patients with aba. in 13
clinical trials involving a total of 1018
asthmatic patients, lolatadine demon1289

strated a long duration of action, effectively controlled asthma symptoms, and
significantly increased pulmonary function. experience with loratadine in clinical trims has shown the drug to be an effective, useful, and well-tolerated addition
to the armamentarium of drugs used for
the management of patients with aba.
