blood-brain barrier and neuronal membrane transport of 6-[18f]fluoro-l-dopa.  the transport of 6-[18f]fluoro- xxxd2471xxx  ([18f]fdopa) across the blood-brain barrier (bbb) and neuronal membranes was compared with that of  xxxd2471xxx  (l-dopa) in rats. the carotid injection method was used as a direct measurement of [18f]fdopa, 1-[14c]-l-dopa, and 3-[14c]-l-dopa transport across the bbb, while isolated nerve terminals were used to examine neuronal membrane transport of [3h]-l-dopa. [18f]fdopa appeared to use the same large neutral amino acid carrier for bbb transport as l-dopa and l-phenylalanine. in addition, carbidopa [l-alpha-hydrazino-alpha-methyl-beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) xxxd3029xxx ] was found not to have direct interference with the transport carrier on the bbb, but indirectly inhibited  xxxg618xxx  (aaad) activity in brain endothelium by depletion of  xxxd3047xxx , a necessary cofactor of the enzyme. in striatal and cortical synaptosomes, [3h]-l-dopa uptake was inhibited by non-radioactive l-dopa, fdopa, and 6-fluoro-l-meta-tyrosine (6-fmt). the inhibition was significantly greater in terminals isolated from the striatum than in those from the cerebral cortex. fdopa, 6-fmt, and l-dopa equally inhibited the neuronal transport of [3h]-l-dopa. this suggests that fdopa and 6-fmt compete with l-dopa at similar transport sites at the neuronal membrane.
