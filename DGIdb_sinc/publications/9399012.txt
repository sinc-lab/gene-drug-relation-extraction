 xxxd3562xxx  (zomig@;formerly  xxxd3562xxx ) is a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht),,/,, receptor agynist with
proven efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine with or without preceding cwrci.the drug differs from
presently available members of this drug class in that it combines 5ht,,,,, receptor partial agonist activity
with robust oral pharmacokinetics and an ability to inhibit trigeminovascular activation centrally as well
as peripherally in preclinical studies. consistent with its selectivity for 5ht,,,,, receptors,  xxxd3562xxx 
produces constriction of various isolated blood vessels, most notably cranial arteries. in anaesthetized
animals, these vascular effects manifest as a selective constriction of cranial arterio-venous anastomoses
resulting in a redistribution of carotid arterial blood flow. this effect is produced without significant effects
on heart rate, blood pressure or blood flow to the brain, heart or lungs.  xxxd3562xxx  also inhibits trigeminalevoked increases in cerebral blood flow in anaesthetized cats and blocks trigeminal-evoked plasma protein
extravasation in the dura of guinea-pigs. these actions are consistent with a pre-junctional inhibition of
neuropeptide release from perivascular afferents of the trigeminal nerve, as confirmed by independent
studies showing that  xxxd3562xxx  blocks elevations of calcitonin-gene-related peptide in jugular venous
blood during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. in all of these effects,  xxxd3562xxx  is three
to four times more potent than sumatriptan, but produces the same maximum response.  xxxd3562xxx 
crosses the intact blood-brain barrier to inhibit trigeminovascular activation in the brainstem. this was
shown initially by the ability of the drug to block a brainstem reflex provoking  xxxg2417xxx 
release from the viith cranial (facial) nerve during trigeminal stimulation. subsequent ('x vivo autoradiography confirmed that intravenously injected [3h] xxxd3562xxx  labels a discrete population of cells in the
trigeminal nucleus caudalis (tnc) and nucleus tractus solitarius. direct evidence for a central neuromodulatory effect of  xxxd3562xxx  was provided by electrophysiological experiments which clearly demonstrated
that the drug inhibits the excitability of cells in the tnc after systemic administration. this novel preclinical profile not only distinguishes  xxxd3562xxx  from sumatriptan, but raises intriguing questions about
the clinical relevance of a  xxxd2082xxx . studies to date show that  xxxd3562xxx  indeed modulates cranial
sensory processing in humans, yet central side-effects are no different from sumatriptan. this property may
account for the remarkable consistency in clinical efficacy observed in clinical trials. i niip'airic, z ~ d n ~ ~ t r ~ p t ~ ~ n ,

the introduction of sumatriptan in 1990 represented
a remarkable breakthrough in headache therapy and
has served to highlight the importance of the
5ht,,/,, agonist class of drugs in the acute treatment
of migraine and cluster headache. despite its relatively low oral bioavailability (14%) (l),the efficacy
of sumatriptan is well established (2). moreover, its
utility as a research tool has encouraged intense preclinical and clinical investigation that has thrown
new light on long-standing theories concerning
migraine pathophysiology. the early dogma that
sumatriptan owes its efficacy in migraine to a selective constrictor action on meningeal and large cerebral vessels (3, 4) has been challenged repeatedly (5,
6) and it is now generally accepted that the drug
also acts directly on perivascular trigeminal afferents
to inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides (7-9). these actions i.e. vasoconstriction and

inhibition of neuropeptide release, are presumed to
be peripheral, since the drug is reported not to cross
the intact blood-brain barrier (bbb) (10, 11). this
background laid the foundations for the development of  xxxd3562xxx , a drug which, like sumatriptan,
is a 5-hydroxytrptamine (5ht),,/,, receptor agonist,
but which, unlike sumatriptan, exerts dual central
and peripheral inhibitory effects on the trigeminovascular system (fig. 1).
the research program which culminated in the
development of  xxxd3562xxx  began in april 1988,
shortly after humphrey and colleagues (10) had
conducted proof-of-concept studies with a prototype
drug, ah25086 (3-aminoethyl-n-methyl-1h-indole5-methane carboxamide), and then sumatriptan itself
to confirm the efficacy of 5ht1,/,, agonists in the
symptomatic treatment of migraine. as the scientific
and clinical credentials of sumatriptan emerged, it

fig. 1. schematic of the trigeminovascular system (modified from moskowitz [5]; moskowitz et al. [12]). inappropriate activation of
the trigeminal nerve is ived to result in antidromic activation and the liberation of neuropeptide transmitters, such as cgrp and
 xxxg2240xxx , in the blood vessel wall. these initiate a neurogenic inflammatory response comprising vessel dilation and fenestration
of the. vascular endothelium leading to cxtravasation of plasma proteins and edema. this process sensitizes the trigeminal nerve,
making it hyper-excitable to mechanical and chemical stimuli and increasing the activation of second order neurons in the brainstem.
transmission of this input to higher centers leads to the perception of pain. within the brainstem, the increased trigeminal input
causes reflex activation of the vlith cranial nerve which innervates predominantly extra-cranial blood vessels. the resulting release
of vip further aggravates trigeminovascular activation by provoking powerful cranial vessel dilatation.

became clear that it should be possible to improve
upon. the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
profile of sumatriptan and thereby achieve even
greater therapeutic benefit. with this aim in mind, a
number of characteristics desirable in the new drug
candidate were established. firstly, the drug must
be a 5htlbildreceptor partial agonist, to maximize
organ-selective drug action. secondly, the drug must
exhibit reliable oral pharmacokinetics, providing
rapid oral absorption, good bioavailability and a
plasma elimination half-life consistent with the
symptomatic treatment of migraine. thirdly, a central action of the drug would not be excluded a priori,
rather interactions with central nociceptive pathways
would be evaluated early in the program to assess
the risk/benefit in terms of potential therapeutic
advantage. the justification for this was entirely
intuitive and based upon the fact that the pseudounipolar organization of the trigeminal nerve (fig. 1)
offers an opportunity to inhibit neuroexcitation not
only at the afferent (peripheral) terminals, but also
at the efferent (central) terminals where they converge in the trigeminal nucleus.

medicinal chemistry efforts that led to the design
and synthesis of  xxxd3562xxx  were guided mainly
by data obtained using ring preparations of rabbit
saphenous vein. in this tissue, 5ht-induced contractions are mediated by a receptor defined originally
as "5htl-like" (13) and subsequently as ~ h t (14,
~d
15). however, it is now recognized that receptor
~ fact

assays originally classified as ~ h t in
two subtypes of pharmacologically indistinguishable
receptors nominated 5htlb (formerly 5ht1,,) and
5htld(formerly 5htld,) (16,17). in the rabbit saphenous vein, as in many other blood vessels (including human cerebral vessels), mrna has been
identified for both of these receptor subtypes (18,
19). in the absence of selective ligands to establish
which of these subtypes participates in any given
blood vessel to the vasoconstrictor responses mediated by sumatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx  and the other
members of the " xxxd3263xxx " class, these drugs are more
properly regarded as 5ht1,/1~agonists.

the rabbit saphenous vein preparation served to
produce reliable measures of 5ht1b,1d receptor
agonist activity for a wide range of known and novel
ligands. the ergots,  xxxd2621xxx  and 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5ct) were used initially to define key
structural groups favoring target receptor affinity
and selectivity. however, since the tertiary structure
of the receptor was unknown, an active analogue
approach (20) was adopted to identify potential
receptor bound conformations of key ligands. this
involved computing the distances between important functional groups for a range of active molecules
and obtaining an overlay of these groups constrained
by one set of distance ranges. this process enabled
the construction of a pharmacophore model defining
the relative positions of the groups important for
affinity and selectivity. this, in turn, provided a
molecular framework upon which to base the design
and synthesis of novel analogues (21).

ldentifying orally bioavailable 5ht,,/,,

agonists

guided by the pharmacophore model, novel
5ht1,/,, receptor partial agonists were quickly identified and shown to be highly potent and selective.
unfortunately, all of these compounds had very
poor oral bioavailability ( < 5%) making them unsuitable for clinical development. further investigations
revealed that this low bioavailability was due to
poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.
excluding specific uptake mechanisms, there are two
main routes of absorption from the gastrointestinal
tract: trans-cellular uptake, involving passage across
the phospholipid membrane; and para-cellular
uptake, which involves passage through aqueous
pores. thirty chemically diverse drugs known to be
orally bioavailable were therefore surveyed and the
a measure of
distribution coefficient (log d,,,:
partitioning between aqueous and lipid environments) and molar refractivity (cmr: an estimate of
molecular volume) of each determined (22). a plot
of cmr against 1ogdph7.4
is shown in fig. 2. from
this plot, it is clear that orally bioavailable drugs fall
into one of three arbitrarily defined categories:

category 1: small, hydrophobic molecules which are
assumed to cross the intestinal membrane via both
the para- and trans-cellular routes.

philic for absorption via the trans-cellular route
and too large for absorption via aqueous pores.
intriguingly, virtually all of the early agonists synthesized fell within this "forbidden zone" or very close
to it, suggesting that smaller more hydrophilic analogues were required. the pharmacophore model
was therefore revisited in order to redesign analogues which now satisfied both affinity and absorption criteria.
compounds from this new chemical series exhibited oral bioavailability in the rat ranging from
46-100%. however, it became evident that within
this series, the physical-chemical features promoting
oral bioavailability also enhanced passage across the
blood-brain barrier. a select number of potential
development candidates was therefore subjected to
a battery of behavioral tests and their ability to
penetrate the bbb measured using gc-mass spectroscopy. these studies confirmed that, in general,
candidates with high oral bioavailability appeared
in the brain of rats at increasing concentrations and,
in a variety of species, exhibited increasingly unacceptable central side-effects.  xxxd3562xxx  was
selected as the candidate with an optimal balance
between central penetration and oral bioavailability.

the receptor specificity of  xxxd3562xxx  was determined using both functional and radioligand displacement assays. whenever possible, functional
studies were performed using isolated intact tissues
to determine potency (p[a],,: -log,, [drug] producing 50% of the maximum effect) and intrinsic activity (a,the agonist maximum effect) relative to 5ht

and sumatriptan. otherwise, brain homogenates and
cells transfected with human recombinant receptors
were used to provide estimates of affinity (pki or
plcs0)at a wide range of receptors. particular attention was paid to the actions of  xxxd3562xxx  at
5htiblldreceptors mediating vascular contraction
and to the effects of the drug on human recombinant
5htlband 5ht,, receptors transfected into chinese
hamster ovary (cho-k1) cells.
at vascular (rabbit saphenous vein) 5htib,,,
receptors,  xxxd3562xxx  is a potent partial agonist
mediating constriction. in this preparation, the drug
is twice as potent as sumatriptan (p[a],,= 6.8 c.f.
6.5). this higher potency results entirely from a
higher affinity of  xxxd3562xxx  for the receptor, as
confirmed by additional studies using receptor inactivation methods to estimate agonist affinity and
agonist efficacy (pka = 6.6 c.f. 6.2). interestingly, this
study also revealed that both drugs are partial agonists at the vascular receptor with similar efficacy
relative to 5ht (intrinsic efficacy, z=0.6 c.f. 5ht)
(23). since it remains conceivable that the vascular
receptor is 5htlb or 5ht,, (or a mixture of both),
additional studies examined interactions with the
human recombinant forms of these subtypes.
radioligand displacement studies using transfected
cho-k1 cell membranes showed that  xxxd3562xxx 
displays high affinity at both receptors, but is marginally selective for the 5ht,, (pic,, = 9.2) over the
5ht,, (plc,, = 8.3) subtype. at both subtypes,  xxxd3562xxx  behaves as a full agonist relative to 5ht,
producing concentration-dependent inhibition of
 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl cyclase (p[ai5, = 9.9
and 9.5 at 5htid and 5htlb respectively). this is
consistent with the coupling of the 5ht, family of
receptors to gcti. (14, 24). with the exception of the
human recombinant 5htla receptor and putative
*5htlfreceptor, at which  xxxd3562xxx  displays moderate affinity, the drug has no or negligible affinity
at a wide range of other receptor types, including
other 5ht receptors (26). whether or not actions at
5htla and 5ht1, receptors plays any role in the
mechanism of action of this drug remains unclear,
but affinity at these members of the 5ht, receptor
family is a feature of all "triptans" currently being
developed (see table 2). only is159, a 5htib/,, agonist known to be efficacious in migraine, is reported
to lack affinity at the putative 5ht1, receptor, suggesting that this receptor subtype is unlikely to be
important in the  xxxd2022xxx  effects of this drug
class (27).

isolated cranial blood vessels from various species.
consistent with its actions in saphenous vein, the
drug is two to three times more potent than sumatriptan as a constrictor of basilar artery rings from
dog, cat and primate, both drugs producing a similar
maximum effect (e.g. fig. 3). however, in each of
these vessels  xxxd3562xxx  and sumatriptan produce
about 50% of the maximum effect obtained with
5ht. this is because 5ht acts at both 5htlb/,, and
5ht2, receptors to produce constriction of these
vessels, while  xxxd3562xxx  and sumatriptan activate
only the 5htlbildreceptors to produce an effect. the
co-existence of these receptor types in both intraand extra-cranial blood vessels has been shown for
most mammalian species, including man (15).

h u m a n coronary vasculatuue. in epicardial coronary
artery rings from five patients,  xxxd3562xxx  produced concentration-related contractions ( p[ai5,, =
7.3 f0.1) achieving an average maximum effect
which was 37f8% of the 5ht maximum. in
parallel experiments sumatriptan produced the same
magnitude of contraction (35+7% c.f. 5ht), but
was -4-fold less potent (p[a],,=6.7+0.1). like
the mammalian basilar artery, human coronary
artery possesses 5ht, receptors which also contribute to 5ht-induced contractions and account
for the greater maximum effect produced by the
natural agonist. a recent independent study by
vandenbrink et al. (30) confirmed this profile of
effect for  xxxd3562xxx  in human coronary artery
segments and showed that the magnitude of coronary artery contraction was similar for  xxxd3135xxx  and
naratriptan. the clinical significance of this coronary
vascular effect of the " xxxd3263xxx " drug class remains

unclear, though it bears emphasis that at therapeutic
doses (up to 5 mg, orally), the peak plasma concentration of  xxxd3562xxx  (approximately 25 nm) is twofold lower than the [a]50(concentration producing
50% of the maximum effect) value (50nm) determined in coronary arteries in vifro (see above). by
comparison, plasma concentrations of sumatriptan
are equivalent to the [aim for this drug (approximately 200nm) following an oral dose (up to
100 mg) and twice the [a],, (approximately 400 nm)
after subcutaneous injection (6 mg) (31, 32). these
results suggest that  xxxd3562xxx  is less likely than
sumatriptan to produce coronary vascular effects at
an oral dose shown to produce similar therapeutic
efficacy. furthermore, in in vivo studies, at doses
that produce a maximal effect on cranial .artery
conductance,  xxxd3562xxx  had no significant effect
on coronary arterial conductance (see below).

actions on cranial and sysfemic hemodynnnrics in
annesthetized animals
selective cranio-vascular actions of  xxxd3562xxx 
would be expected on the basis of the prominent
distribution of 5ht18/1~receptors in the cranial vasculature (33-35). studies were therefore conducted
using anesthetized cats and dogs to examine systemic and regional blood flow effects following intravenous injection. in all cases, blood flow changes
were measured in units of conductance (the reciprocal of resistance =blood flow/mean blood pressure) which takes into account any effects produced
by variations in blood pressure.
intravenous bolus injection of  xxxd3562xxx 
(0.1-30 pg/kg) produced persistent, dose-dependent
reductions in carotid arterial conductance (ed50= 1.1
and 2.9 pg/kg ;maximum reduction =39% and 67%,
respectively, for cats and dogs). these effects were
accompanied in the cat by reductions in ear (extracerebral) microvascular conductance ( - 15% to
-60% at intravenous doses of 1-30pg/kg), confirming that the intra- and extra-cranial vasculature
possesses 5ht1,/,, receptors mediating constriction.
however, no significant effects on heart rate, blood
pressure or coronary arterial conductance (dogs)
were noted (fig. 4). at high doses (2300 pg/kg) in
both cats and dogs the drug produced occasional,
inconsistent falls in heart rate and mean blood pressure, but these were not marked. there was no effect
on blood gases at doses up to 1000 pg/kg. separate
studies in anaesthetized cats showed that  xxxd3562xxx  had no effect on pulmonary arterial blood flow
at doses up to 100pg/kg iv and was likewise
without effect on pial (cerebral) microvascular conductance at doses of up to 1000 pg/kg. by contrast,
noradrenaline caused significant increases in blood
pressure and decreases in pial microvascular conductance. this lack of effect of  xxxd3562xxx  is import-

ant, since the ability of the drug to cross the intact
bbb implies access to the cerebro-vascular intima.
evidently, either access is insufficient to modify
cerebral blood flow in this species, or drug effects
are subtle (c.f. noradrenaline effects) and easily overridden by autoregulatory mechanisms.
in order to study regional blood flow effects of
 xxxd3562xxx  more precisely, studies were conducted
in anaesthetized cats using radiolabelled microspheres (15 pm diameter). injection of these microspheres into the left atrium provides a means to
follow dose-dependent drug effects on blood flow
to all the major organs. the specific cranial distribution of carotid arterial blood was monitored by
injecting microspheres directly into the carotid arterial circulation via the lingual artery.
whole-body studies showed that at doses up to
1000 pg/kg (500 times the dose required to halfmaximally decrease carotid arterial flow), blood flow
to the myocardium, stomach, intestine and the brain
was not altered by  xxxd3562xxx . interestingly, blood
flow increased to the kidneys (+%yo at 100 pg/kg),
adrenal glands ( + 153% at 1,000 pg/kg) and liver
(+229% at 30 pg/kg), while there was a decrease: in
blood flow to the spleen (-55% at 1,000 pg/kg) and
the eyes (-62% at 1,000 pg/kg) (37). the mechanism(s) underlying these changes remain unclear, but
may relate to the known ability of  xxxd3562xxx  and
other drugs in this class to modulate autonomic
function, presumably by inhibitory actions at sympathetic ganglia (38) and/or pre-synaptic postganglionic sympathetic terminals (39). interestingly,
there is no evidence that  xxxd3562xxx  produces a
sympatholytic effect in man at up to 20 times the

cephalalgia suppl 18 (1497)

therapeutic dose (40). however, this appears not to
be the case for all of the drugs in this class, since
early clinical studies with  xxxd3135xxx  ( xxxd3135xxx )
showed that at higher doses, this drug produced
episodes of vaso-vagal syncope, presumably due to
sympathetic withdrawal (41).
injection of microspheres directly into the carotid
arterial circulation showed that 51% of the carotid
blood flow in the anaesthetized cat by-passes the
cranial microcirculation via cranial arterio-venous
anastomoses (avas). the significant dose-related
reduction in carotid arterial blood flow following
intravenous  xxxd3562xxx  (0.1-30 pg/kg) was due
almost exclusively to a decrease in ava blood flow
( - 95% reduction, at 30 pg/ kg), implying selective
constriction of these vessels by  xxxd3562xxx .
 xxxd3562xxx  also caused a modest reduction in
extra-cerebral blood conductance ( - 24% at
30 pg/kg), but this contributed no more than 12%
of the total decrease in carotid blood flow.
importantly, the drug produced no change in cerebral blood flow or conductance.

peptide (cgrp),  xxxg2240xxx  (sp) and vasoactive
intestinal polypeptide (vip) resulting in a powerful,
local vasodilatation, edema formation in the blood
vessel wall and recruitment of inflammatory cells.
this neurogenic inflammatory response is thought
to underlie the pain of migraine headache (43). in
order to study the effects of anti-migraine drugs on
trigemino-vascular activation, a number of experimental models have been developed.
in a paradigm described originally by moskowitz
and colleagues (43), trigeminal neurons of rats or
guinea-pigs are activated by electrical or chemical
stimulation and plasma protein extravasation into
the ipsilateral dural membrane measured as a ratio
of plasma protein appearing in the unstimulated
side. various 5htl,,ld agonists, including the ergots
dihydroergotamine and ergotamine, have been
shown to inhibit this plasma protein extravasation,
presumably by acting at pre-junctional receptors to
inhibit trigeminal nerve excitability (5, 6). when

co-incubation with 10 mm 5ht or  xxxd3562xxx .
[3h]zolmitriptanbinding was markedly heterogeneous with the highest densities of binding observed
in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, the nucleus
tractus solitarius of the brainstem and the dorsal
horns of the c1 and c2 cervical spinal cord (see
fig. 5 and table 1).in the hindbrain, specific labeling
of the subnucleus gelatinosus and area postrema
was also observed. very little binding was seen in
the ventral grey matter or in the dorsal or ventral
white matter. binding was unaffected by 8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin (8-oh-dpat:20 nm), but was
abolished by 5ct (200 nm). this confirmed that the
radiolabel was not binding to either 5ht,, or 5ht1,
sites and provided confidence that 5htlbildreceptors were being labeled. to further investigate the
nature of the [3h]zolmitriptanbinding to the nucleus
tractus solitarius (nts) and trigeminal nucleus
caudalis (tnc), autoradiographic analysis was performed using  xxxd2419xxx  (0.1, 1.0 and 10 pm) as a
displacing ligand.  xxxd2419xxx  is up to 120-fold more
selective for ~ h t ~
than
d 5ht1, receptors (47). in
two independent experiments, displacement of
[3h] xxxd3562xxx  binding from these brain regions
was qualitatively and quantitatively similar, with an
icw between 0.1 and 1 pm. this implies that the
binding of [3h]zolmitriptanis homogeneous in these
nuclei, but whether or not binding is to ~ h t ~ b
receptors, 5htldreceptors or both, remains elusive.
since the studies on neuropeptide release suggested that in the cat systemically administered
 xxxd3562xxx  crosses the blood-brain barrier to
produce central neuroinhibition, ex vivo binding
of [3h] xxxd3562xxx  was examined by injecting
[3h]zolmitriptanvia the femoral vein. the brain and
spinal cord were removed 1 h later and processed
as described above. as shown in table 1, ex vivo
labeling mirrored the findings of the itz uitro study
although, as expected, overall binding densities were
lower. the lack of [3h]zolmitriptanbinding observed

manner following intravenous administration of
 xxxd3562xxx  at a dose of 30 yg/kg (167k11 mv)
or 100 pg/kg (98 & 17 mv).  xxxd3562xxx  likewise
decreased the probability of cell firing following
stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus (fig. 6). the
baseline probability value of 0.63f0.1 was reduced
to 0.41 f0.04 and 0.13 f0.05 ( p < 0.05) following iv
injection of drug at 30 pg/kg and 100 pg/kg respectively and the effects were prolonged. however,
neither dose had any effect on the latency to the
fastest component. these results therefore provide
direct evidence for a central neuromodulatory effect
of  xxxd3562xxx  after systemic administration to
anaesthetized cats.

ventral white matter is most likely to be a reflection
of the low number of receptors in these regions.
these experiments established two important findings; firstly, they demonstrated for the first time that
5ht,,,,, receptors are discretely localized in central
trigeminal (and other) sites that are likely to be
activated during migraine. secondly, they confirmed
that, in contrast to sumatriptan (48),  xxxd3562xxx 
can indeed access these sites after systemic
administration.
the above evidence for a central action of  xxxd3562xxx , although compelling, was nevertheless only
indirect. direct evidence for a central neuroinhibitory
effect was therefore sought using an anaesthetized
cat model of craniovascular pain which involves
mild electrical stimulation of the superior sagittal
sinus and monitoring evoked trigeminal neuronal
activity using electrophysiological techniques (49,
50). recordings were made from caudal trigeminal
neurons at the c2 level of the cervical spinal cord
using tungsten-in-glass microelectrodes. by stimulating the sinus with a hook electrode (250 msec and
duration, 150 v, 0.3 hz), the trigeminal nerves
innervating the sinus are directly activated, thus,
avoiding the peripheral 5ht1,,,, receptor thought
to mediate inhibition of neurogenically-evoked protein extravasation into the dura. the signals were
then amplified and both evoked potentials and single
cell data recorded and analyzed.
clear, reproducible trigeminal potentials were
evoked by stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus;
the mean baseline response was 207k 14 mv. the
amplitude of these evoked potentials was significantly ( p < 0.05) diminished in a dose-dependent

centrally-mediated neuroinhibition in humans
the ability of small, hydrophilic molecules like
sumatriptan and  xxxd3562xxx  to penetrate the bloodbrain barrier exhibits overt species-dependence. both
drugs attain only negligible concentrations in the
brain of rats ( < 0.05% of a systemically administered
dose) (11) (zeneca, data on file), whereas in beagle
dogs both rapidly provoke a marked, stereotypical
behavioral syndrome consistent with ready access to
the brain in this species (20% of the administered
dose of sumatriptan appears in the cerebro-spinal
fluid (11)).however, the cns effect of these two
drugs differs in the cat; whereas  xxxd3562xxx  clearly
penetrates into the brainstem and spinal cord to
produce neuroinhibition (see above), sumatriptan
fails to do so unless the bbb is first disrupted (48).
clinical studies suggest that a similar situation
may pertain in humans. there are two lines of

evidence. firstly, neurophysiological studies conducted in a mixed group of migraine and nonmigraine subjects (outside of an attack) have shown
that  xxxd3562xxx  (5 and lomg, orally), but not
sumatriptan (100 mg, orally), produces a dosedependent modulation of cortical auditory evoked
potentials consistent with an inhibition of central
serotonergic transmission (52). in this study, lorazepam (1.25 mg, orally) was without effect, confirming that the effect was not secondary to
somnolence. secondly, two independent clinical
studies have shown that sumatriptan administered
prior to the onset of headache in either migrainewith-aura or cluster headache patients, is ineffective
(53, 54). since the drug is effective in aborting an
ongoing headache, this suggests that the headache
per se somehow facilitates access of the drug to its
site of action. by contrast,  xxxd3562xxx  given orally
(20 mg) to migraine-with-aura patients in a pilot
study has provided tantalizing evidence to suggest
that this drug may be of value in pre-emptive
treatment (55). however, these results are preliminary and further clinical studies are required to
address this possibility directly. although there is
no evidence to suggest that the permeability of the
blood-brain barrier is increased during migraine (56),
these data add weight to the speculation that central
pathways involved cranial pain modulation are an
important site of action of 5ht,,/,, agonist drugs.

discussion
it is evident from the foregoing that in terms of
receptor specificity and effects on the cardiovascular
system of animals,  xxxd3562xxx  exhibits the attributes that typify the 5ht,,/,, agonist class of drugs.
a marked feature of these drugs is their ability to
produce a selective redistribution of the cranial
(carotid) arterial blood supply without compromising cerebral blood flow. this appears to be due to
a prominence of 5htlbildreceptors in cranial avas
which clearly provide a major conduit for carotid
blood flow in the anaesthetized state. it bears
emphasis that there is no robust evidence for such a
redistribution of the carotid blood supply in conscious animals and no evidence that avas serve an
important role in craniovascular modulation in man.
the relevance of this hemodynamic profile to the
therapeutic benefit of 5ht,,/,, agonists therefore
remains a topic of debate (6).
it might be argued that the actions of 5ht,,/,,
agonists on the neuronal elements of the trigeminovascular system are more relevant to their therapeutic
utility in migraine (5, 6). although there has been a
gradual acceptance that sumatriptan probably exerts
a neuroinhibitory effect on perivascular trigeminal
afferents, the possibility that such an action might
make a major contribution to therapeutic efficacy for

cfi’hal.ai,gia

suppl 18 (1997)

this drug class has been hitherto unexplored.
 xxxd3562xxx  is the first in a line of alternative
5ht,,/,, receptor agonist drugs which attempts to
address this question head-on. the ability of this
drug to access brainstem components involved in
processing cranial pain results in a novel profile in
pre-clinical studies, in which it is clear that central
neuro-inhibitory actions contribute to the mechanisms by which the drug dampens trigeminal nerve
activity. moreover,  xxxd3562xxx  exhibits robust
human oral pharmacokinetics with favorable oral
bioavailability (f =approximately 40% at 2.5 mg and
5 m g doses) (57). this combination of properties
distinguishes the drug from sumatriptan which penetrates the bbb of animals poorly and exhibits a low
human oral bioavailability (f = 14%) (1). although
central penetration combined with favorable oral
bioavailability and rapid absorption might be
expected to confer more central side effects, a headto-head clinical trial comparing  xxxd3562xxx  with
sumatriptan has shown that this is not the case and
in this regard, the two drugs are indistinguishable
(31). what is evident, however, is that  xxxd3562xxx 
shows a remarkable consistency in clinical efficacy
(58). it is tempting to speculate that this consistency
of effect results from more reliable access to the
target receptors.
further potential clinical benefits of  xxxd3562xxx ’s
 xxxd2082xxx  on the trigeminovascular system remain
to be explored. for example, sumatriptan is effective
only after the headache phase of migraine has started
(53,54). this has prompted speculation that the drug
requires” the headache to facilitate its access to the
site of action (59). in this respect, the utility of
sumatriptan would appear to be limited to symptomatic relief from an ongoing migraine attack. the
ability of  xxxd3562xxx  to access central sites of action
in a “normal” i.e. non-migrainous cerebral circulation might therefore imply utility in early, possibly
pre-emptive treatment. available pilot study data
provide some support for this contention (55),
although larger patient studies with an appropriate
formulation of  xxxd3562xxx  are clearly required
before such a benefit can be claimed. it is nevertheless noteworthy that the ergot alkaloids are advocated for early use in a migraine attack and, like
 xxxd3562xxx , these also cross the blood-brain barrier
to access the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and other
central structures involved in pain transmission (60).
the merits of a drug with cns and peripheral
actions on the trigeminovascular system such as
 xxxd3562xxx  will be demonstrated with increased
clinical experience. by revisiting pre-clinical paradigms with this new information, we can hope to
better understand migraine pathophysiology and
define more precisely the locus of action of this
important, new drug class.
