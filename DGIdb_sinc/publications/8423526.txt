serotonin-induced contraction in porcine coronary artery: use of ergolines to support vascular 5-hydroxytryptamine2-receptor heterogeneity.  serotonin-induced contraction in porcine coronary artery was studied in ring segments of coronary artery without endothelium. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), 5-methoxytryptamine (5-meot) and alpha-methyl-5-ht (alpha me-5-ht) concentration-dependently contracted vessels with similar maximal force. the agonist rank order potency was 5-ht > alpha me-5-ht > 5-meot. neither  xxxd3000xxx  (1 microm) nor tetrodotoxin (0.3 microm) significantly altered 5-ht-induced contraction, ruling out activation of alpha-1 adrenoceptors and sodium channels in the contractile response, respectively. using 5-meot as the prototype agonist, cyanopindolol blocked contraction with an antagonist dissociation constant lower than expected for 5-ht1-receptor blockade and ics 205-930 (10 microm) did not affect 5-meot-induced contraction. five structurally distinct 5-ht2-receptor antagonists ( xxxd2419xxx ,  xxxd1708xxx , spiperone, mdl11939, ici169369) blocked 5-ht-induced contraction with antagonist dissociation constants similar to reported 5-ht2-receptor affinities. two ergoline-based 5-ht2-receptor antagonists, ly53857 and sergolexole, blocked 5-ht-induced contraction with antagonist dissociation constants lower than expected for vascular 5-ht2-receptor blockade. based on the agonist profile and the fact that ics 205-930 and cyanopindolol were not potent antagonists, the 5-ht receptor-mediating contraction does not represent either the 5-ht1a/b/c/d, 5-ht3 or  xxxg1117xxx  receptor. rather, based on the affinity of several established 5-ht2-receptor antagonists, a  xxxg1113xxx  mediates contraction in porcine coronary artery. however, the low antagonist affinity of the ergolines (i.e., ly53857 and sergolexole) suggests that heterogeneity of 5-ht2 receptors may exist among species.
