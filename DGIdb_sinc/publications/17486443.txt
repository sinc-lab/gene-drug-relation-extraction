abstract fluoxetine, as a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
augments serotonin concentration within the synapse by
inhibiting the serotonin transporter. the contribution of
amino acids has also been shown in depression. we
hypothesized that fluoxetine exerts its actions at least in
part by intervening brain signaling operated by amino acid
transmitters. therefore the aim of this study is to supply
neurochemical evidence that fluoxetine produces changes
in amino acids in cerebrospinal fluid of rats. spraguedawley rats were anesthetized and concentric microdialysis probes were implanted stereotaxically into the right
lateral ventricle. intraperitoneal fluoxetine (2.5 or 5 mg/kg)
or physiological saline was administered and the probes
were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid at a rate of
1 ll/min. in the chronic fluoxetine group, the rats were
treated daily with oral fluoxetine solution or inert syrup for
3 weeks. the microdialysis probes were placed on the 21st
day and perfused the next day. fluoxetine was ineffective
in changing the cerebrospinal fluid gaba levels at the
dose of 2.5 mg/kg but produced a significant increase in the
perfusates following injection of 5 mg/kg of fluoxetine
(p < 0.05). oral fluoxetine administration (5 mg/kg) for
21 days also elevated the csf gaba levels by approximately 2-fold (p < 0.05). l- xxxd2431xxx  levels were not
affected in all groups. these neurochemical findings show
that fluoxetine, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
affects brain gaba levels indirectly, and our results

introduction
depression and other mood disorders are relatively common mental illnesses but the therapy for a substantial
number of patients is still unsatisfactory. for many years,
clinicians and neuroscientists regarded alterations shown in
brain monoamine function as the underlying cause of
depression. the most important pathogenetic mechanisms
of depression appear to be related to monoamine and the
serotonin systems; however the effects of amino acid
transmitters on the onset of depression, complications and
antidepressant therapy are either underestimated or
unknown. c- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) and the l-glutamic
acid are two important amino acids in the central nervous
system where the first acts an inhibitory and the latter as an
excitatory neurotransmitter. even though the amino acids
are much more abundant in mammalian central nervous
system compared to biogenic amines, the pharmacodynamic effects of various antidepressants on amino acid
transmitter systems are not very well documented.
previously, decreased gaba concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid [1], plasma [2, 3] or brain tissue [4] were
reported in depression. increased gabaa/benzodiazepine
binding sites were also documented, implying that the
decreased gaba activity caused the binding sites to be
increased as an outcome of an adaptive mechanism [5, 6].
it is also well-known that gaba agonists have
anti-depressant effects [7, 8].

inhibition of transporter proteins is an important
mechanism through which most of the antidepressant drugs
exert their effects through inhibition of the presynaptic
re-uptake of transmitters. fluoxetine, a bicyclic antidepressant inhibits the presynaptic re-uptake of serotonin specifically [9]. it has essentially no effect on the re-uptake of
norepinephrine or other neurotransmitters and has negligible
binding affinity for neurotransmitter receptor sites [9]. the
present study was performed to investigate how acute or
chronic (21 days) fluoxetine treatment affects gaba and
l- xxxd2431xxx  levels in cerebrospinal microdialysis
perfusates of conscious moving sprague-dawley rats.

experimental procedure
animals
male sprague-dawley rats weighing 250–275 g and supplied from ‘‘marmara university experimental research
and animal laboratory’’ were used. all experiments were
carried out with humane methods and the experimental
procedures were approved by the marmara university
ethical committee for experimental animals. the animals
were kept in a temperature-controlled, 12-h light and dark
cycle and fed with standard animal food and water.
microdialysis probes, stereotaxic surgery and perfusion
procedures
concentric microdialysis probes were made from 15 mm
length 24 g stainless steel tubings (cooper’s needle
works, uk). inlet and outlet tubes were made of fused
silica (od: 0.19 mm; id: 0.075 mm; polymicro technologies, usa). the inlet emerging from the tip of the
stainless tubing was trimmed to a length of 2 mm and
cuprophan dialysis membrane (gambro ltd, uk) was
passed over the inlet silica where all joints were sealed with
epoxy resin.
the rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal
ketamine (100 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (1.0 mg/kg)
mixture and placed in a stereotaxic frame (stoelting,
model 51600, usa). the scalp skin was incised and the
periosteum was separated from the cranium. two support
screws were placed onto the cranium and the microdialysis probes were implanted into the right lateral ventricle (the coordinates:1.5 mm right, –1 mm posterior
from the bregma and 3.8 mm ventral from the skull
surface). the probe and the screws were sealed with
dental acrylic cement. the collection of intracerebroventricular perfusion samples was performed 24 h
following the surgery. the day after the placement of
microdialysis probes, polyethylene tubings were attached

123

neurochem res (2007) 32:1559–1565

to the inlet of the microdialysis probes to collect the
samples in conscious rat model in a plexiglass cage
(42 · 42 · 20 cm). artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf)
was delivered continuously via a 250 ll hamilton syringe which was connected to a microinfusion pump (kd
scientific, usa). the composition of acsf was 2.5 mm
kcl, 125 mm nacl, 1.26 mm cacl2.2h2o, 1.18 mm
mgcl2.6h2o and 0.2 mm nah2po4.2h2o and the ph
was set to 7. the acsf was filtered through 0.4 lm
nylon membrane filters.
two basal samples were collected at 1 ll/min flow
rate every 20 min in a 0.25 ml ependorf tubes after an
equilibration period of 1 h. after collection of basal
samples, intraperitoneal saline or fluoxetine at 2.5 mg/kg
or 5 mg/kg doses were injected and and three more
consecutive samples were collected. in chronic fluoxetine
group perfusates collected following 1 h equilibration
were analyzed. the dialysates were kept at –80c
until analysis. the rats were decapitated at the end of
experiments and their brains were cut using a blade to
visualize the  xxxd2610xxx  perfused through the probe
for the confirmation of intracerebroventricular perfusion,
only the experiments with proper probe placement were
included in the data analysis.
chromatographic system and hplc analysis
of the samples
the chromatographic system consists of a gradient pump
(agilent 1100, germany) with four solvent bottles,
degasser module, c18 reverse phase nucleosil column
(15 cm and 3.9 cm length, 4.6 mm diameter and 5 lm pore
size), autosampler unit, fluorescence detector with excitation and emission wave lengths of 360 nm and 410 nm
respectively and a computer. the mobile phase is comprised 250 mm na acetate (ph: 6.9), deionized hplc
grade water, methanol where 0.5% (v/v) tetrahydrofuran
was added in all solutions. a gradient flow with an equilibration period of 10 min was delivered at a flow rate of
0.5 ml/min. the temperature of the column was set to
25c. pre-column derivatization was performed with
o-phithaldialdehyde (sigma, usa) and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (sigma, usa) at 4c. injections were given in a
volume of 12 ll with the aid of an autosampler unit using
injection software. the retention times of l- xxxd2431xxx 
and gaba were 5.96 and 29.94 min, respectively. the
chromatographic analysis was carried out with the aid of
software (chemstation).
experimental protocols
in the acute fluoxetine-treated group, fluoxetine (sigma,
usa) dissolved in physiological saline was administered at

neurochem res (2007) 32:1559–1565

2.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg. the rats also received physiological
saline injections prior to fluoxetine injection and a 1 h
wash-out period was given between two treatments. typically, the stereotaxic surgery was performed 24 h before
the collection of perfusates.
in the chronic fluoxetine-treated group the rats
received oral fluoxetine solution (20 mg/5 ml in syrup,
prozac, eli lilly, turkey) at a dose of 5 mg/kg through
a ball shaped cannula syringe  xxxd1891xxx :00 h every day for
21 days. the same protocol was applied to the control
rats but they received inert syrup (the vehicle) containing
sucrose (47%), glycerol (15%) and water. on the 21st
day fluoxetine or inert syrup was administered to study
and control group rats and stereotaxic surgery was
performed at 11:00 h. the collection of intracerebroventricular perfusion was started  xxxd1891xxx :00 h on the 22nd
day of the experiment. all groups were comprised of six
rats.
data analysis
the data are expressed as means ±s.e.m. kruskal–wallis
statistics was applied to test the effects of acute fluoxetine treatment where dunn’s multiple comparison test
was used as a post hoc test. in order to compare the
time-course changes in the samples collected from rats
following two different treatments, area under the curve
(auc) in the concentration-time plot was calculated for
each experiment by using trapezoidal rule and then these
values were accepted as the integrated responses of
physiological saline- and fluoxetine-treated groups (the
unit of integrated response is lm min). the integrated
responses of two groups were compared by student’s
t-test. student’s t-test was also used for analyzing the
chronic effects. the statistical significance was accepted
where p < 0.05.

results
the effects of acute physiological saline or fluoxetine
injections on l- xxxd2431xxx  and gaba concentrations in
the cerebrospinal fluid perfusates.
intraperitoneal injection of physiological saline did not
produce any significant effect on either l- xxxd2431xxx  or
gaba levels in the perfusates collected at 30 min intervals.
fluoxetine at 2.5 mg/kg dose produced no significant
change in the l- xxxd2431xxx  (p = 0.3034) and gaba
levels (p = 0.1511; figs. 1a, b, 2b). when the dose was
increased to 5 mg/kg, the gaba level increased from
0.06 ± 0.01 lm (the basal concentration ([–30–0] min
sample) to 0.28 ± 0.03 lm ([30–60] min sample) yielding a
statistically significant difference (p = 0.0196; fig. 2a).
the comparison of the integrated responses of physiological
saline and 5 mg/kg fluoxetine treatments, showed that fluoxetine treatment is significantly different from the physiological saline treatment (aucsaline = 8.6 ± 0.9 lm min
vs. aucfluoxetine = 20.4 ± 1.6 lm min, p = 0.0079).
the comparison of l- xxxd2431xxx  and gaba in the
cerebrospinal fluid in chronic fluoxetine-treated rats.
administration of inert syrup for 21 days did not produce any significant effect on either l- xxxd2431xxx  or
gaba levels in the perfusates collected at 30 min intervals. fluoxetine at 5 mg/kg dose produced no significant
change in the l- xxxd2431xxx  levels (p = 0.8413) but the
gaba levels increased by almost 2-fold from
0.006 ± 0.001 lm to 0.137 ± 0.015 lm, yielding a significant difference (p = 0.0159; fig. 3).

monoamines, the importance of amino acids cannot be
simply neglected as a substantial number of papers suggest
their involvement depression. in this present study, we
demonstrated the administration of fluoxetine, a specific
inhibitor of the serotonin transporter [9] eventually affected
gaba concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid perfusates
of rats. previous studies demonstrated diminished gaba
levels in the cerebrospinal fluid [1] and plasma [2, 3]
samples of the depressed subjects. spectroscopic studies
also demonstrated decreased gaba concentrations in the
occipital cortex of depressed patients that responded well
to electroconvulsive therapy or pharmacotherapy with
selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [10, 11]. the
gaba level in the cerebrospinal fluid of chronic migraine
patients with or without depression were also analyzed and
it was reported that the gaba levels were significantly
lower in the depressed patients implying that gaba deficiency may be the underlying mechanism of depression in
chronic migraine patients and hence, preventive therapies
modulating gaba neurotransmission could be used in
chronic migraine patients associated with depression [12].
it was also demonstrated that depressed alcoholics had
significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid and of gaba [13].
these findings suggest that there is gaba deficiency in
depression. although the effect of fluoxetine was accepted
to be specific to the inhibition of serotonin transporter

123

protein, gaba level in the csf increases finally. within
the light of these previous findings, we can propose that
fluoxetine may in part exert its beneficial effects through
elevating gaba level. another spectroscopic study also
reported that cognitive behavioral therapy also produced an
effect on cortical gaba content [14]. this study also
indicates that that most of the treatment approaches for
depression increase gaba levels in the brain although
their pattern may be different [14].
it has recently become more clearly understood that
neurosteroids play a role in anxiety disorders, premenstrual
syndrome, postpartum depression, posttraumatic stress
disorder and depression. marx et al. studied the effects of
olanzepine and fluoxetine on gabaergic neuroactive
steroid allopregnanolone [15]. in this study it was demonstrated that fluoxetine and/or olanzepine are beneficial in
depression by correcting the decreased pregnanolone levels, which have been linked to depression [15]. marx et al.
also used fluoxetine at doses (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) similar to
ours [15]. fluoxetine human dose ranges between
20–60 mg/day [16]. the intraperitoneal doses of fluoxetine
used in the rat vary between 1.25 mg/kg [17] to 12.5 mg/
kg [18] in different experimental settings. the discrepancy
in the human doses and rat doses may originate from
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences of
fluoxetine in the species. secondly, we performed our
experiments in rats with normal brain physiology. in this

neurochem res (2007) 32:1559–1565

setting, higher doses might have been required to produce
an observable effect in a rat brain with normal physiology.
another explanation may be that fluoxetine exerts different
effects at different doses. controversially, in socially isolated mice model, fluoxetine has been shown to up-regulate
neurosteroid content stereo-selectively at doses insufficient
to inhibit serotonin re-uptake although they potentiate
pentobarbital-induced sedation and exert anti-aggressive
action [19]. in this study, it was demonstrated that the
inhibition of serotonin re-uptake lacks stereo-specificity
and requires fluoxetine and norfluoxetine doses that are
50-fold greater than those required to increase brain allopregnanolone content and the group concluded that the
term ‘‘selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors’’ may be
misleading in defining the pharmacological profile of fluoxetine and its congeners [19]. in fact, fluoxetine is a safe
drug in terms of adverse effects that occur following
ingestion of acute overdoses. in a case report, a 4-year-old
child exhibited brief spell of unresponsiveness, sinus
tachycardia, and moderate psychomotor agitation and
dyskinesia following accidental ingestion of 43 mg/kg of
fluoxetine where supportive care was provided and the
child recovered completely [20]. the antidepressant study
group also reported that tricyclic antidepressant overdoses
resulted in more toxicity and more frequent admissions to
the intensive care unit than did fluoxetine overdoses [21].
kincaid et al. also reported that very high levels are required for fluoxetine fatality [22].
gaba acts through ionotropic and metabotropic
receptors [23–25]. among the novel treatment targets,
gabab receptors are being investigated intensively. furthermore, there is considerable emphasis on the gabab
receptor antagonists as antidepressants [26]. the effects of
 xxxg828xxx  agonists, antagonists and gabab positive modulators in several experimental models of
depression (forced swim, modified rat forced swim, tailsuspension, learned helplessness and chronic mild stress
tests) have been reviewed very well by cryan and kaupmann. the authors [27] presented the findings that the
 xxxg828xxx  antagonists produced antidepressant-like
effects [28–33]. although not proven yet,  xxxg828xxx 
antagonists may have a promising therapeutic potential.
the relationship with gabab receptors and serotonin
has also been documented. it was reported that the raphé
neurons that are serotonin immunoreactive also express
gabab receptors [34]. gabab and serotonin receptors
were also shown to be coupled to the same k+ channels
[35]. collectively, the  xxxg828xxx -mediated effects
were also reported to be diminished in serotonin transporter
protein knock-out mice [36]. however it is also confusing
and controversial that gaba deficiency is detected in
depression and that blockade of gabab receptors produces antidepressant-like effects as shown experimentally.

1563

the presynaptic gabab receptors involved in this pathological process may be a logical explanation for this confusing situation. the gabab receptors were also involved
in other pathological conditions like anxiety. cryan and
kaupmann [27] summarized that  xxxg828xxx  positive
modulators exhibited anxiolytic effects in several tests like
light-dark box, elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze
[29, 37, 38]. the results of these studies show that there is
precise balance between anxiety and mood.
it has also been reported that certain newer generation
antidepressant agents produced increased rates of suicide
within 10 days of taking antidepressants in patients with
depression [39]. in this survey, the relative risks for newly
diagnosed nonfatal suicidal behavior were found to be 0.83
for amitriptyline, 1.16 for fluoxetine and 1.29 for paroxetine compared with those using dothiepin in 555 cases and
2,062 controls. the role of gaba in suicide should also be
investigated. there are several studies in the literature
performed with post mortem human brain of suicide victims. in one study, no differences in [3h]nipecotic acid
binding sites was reported in terms of method of suicide,
presence of depressive symptom or in comparison with
post-mortem human frontal cortex with regard to aging
[40]. suicide, without doubt, may be considered one of the
most stressful situations occurring in humans. the results
of another study showed the presence of a significant
decrease in the density of [3h]-pk 11195 binding sites in
the patients, as compared with healthy control subjects
[41]. this finding may represent a non-specific indicator of
a condition of stress, since peripheral bdz receptors are
modulated by stress and hormones, or it may result from an
abnormal metabolism of steroid substances that increases
vulnerability towards suicide [41]. gabab binding sites
labeled with [3h]gaba were determined in postmortem
frontal cortex samples of 20 control subjects and 16 suicides [42]. the suicide group was further subdivided
according to the method of suicide and the existence of
depressive symptoms prior to death. no significant differences in gabab binding were found either between
overall suicide and control groups or between the control
group and the other subgroups (violent suicide, nonviolent
suicide, non-depressed and depressed suicide victims). in
this study, a significant increase in gabab binding was
observed in those individuals dying from carbon monoxide
poisoning [42]. the role for gaba and/or fluoxetine in the
suicide should be also further investigated.
there are also clinical trials performed with nmda
type of glutamatergic receptors. in a placebo controlled
double blind study, intravenous ketamine an nmda
antagonist was shown to improve the hamilton depression
scores in seven patients compared to physiological saline at
a dose of 0.5 mg/kg [43]. collectively, the use of ketamine
as an anesthetic agent in orthopedic surgery in the

123

1564

depressed patients corrected depressed mood, relieved
somatic anxiety and decreased suicidal and hypochondriatic thoughts [44]. in a placebo-controlled randomized
double-blind study, it was reported that ketamine infusion
produced an anti-depressant effect that started within 2 h
and lasted for one week [45]. another mechanism in which
amino acids may be involved in the physiopathology of
depression is the change in the glutamate metabolism. in
hospitalized patients with severe depression, the glutamine
concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was found to be
significantly elevated compared to that of controls indicating that there is a distortion in the glial-neuronal glutamine/glutamate cycle [46]. however, we observed that
either acute or chronic fluoxetine treatments produced no
effect on glutamate levels; this is not very surprising since
our experiments were performed with healthy rats. our
data may imply that fluoxetine could non-specifically affect
gabaergic transmission but not  xxxd2431xxx -related
transmission. as the beneficial effects of fluoxetine become
apparent long after the onset of the therapy, the increase in
the gaba levels in chronically treated rats seems to help
to restore the gaba deficiency. the acute effects we
observed may be helpful in controlling anxiety states and
associated with suicide although not proven yet.
schechter et al. reviewed the analysis of gaba levels in
csf samples of patients and pointed out that free gaba
concentrations may vary with age, sex, csf fraction [47].
the authors also suggested that measuring csf gaba
levels is helpful in longitudinal studies to investigate the
influence of pharmacological agents on csf gaba [46].
for all these reasons, we have to consider that gaba
measured in the perfusates does not reflect the synaptic
gaba concentration and further microdialysis experiments in raphé nucleus and cortex should be planned. the
effects of other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
should also be documented. in conclusion, our data
addresses that gaba takes part in the actions generated by
fluoxetine.
