abstract
the anticonvulsant  xxxd2090xxx  blocks n-methyl-d-asparate (nmda) receptors but fails to exhibit the neurobehavioral toxicity characteristic of other nmda receptor antagonists. to investigate the possibility that  xxxd2090xxx ’s
favorable toxicity profile could be related to nmda receptor subtype selectivity, we examined the specificity of
 xxxd2090xxx  block of recombinant nmda receptors composed of the nr1a subunit and various nr2 subunits.
 xxxd2090xxx  produced a rapid, concentration-dependent block of currents evoked by 50 mm nmda and 10 mm glycine
in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the rat nr1a subunit, and either the  xxxg964xxx , nr2b or  xxxg966xxx 
subunits; the ic50 values for block were 2.6, 0.52 and 2.4 mm, respectively (holding potential, − 60 mv). the hill
coefficient values were b1 and, in kinetic analyses, onset and recovery from block were well fit by double exponential
functions, indicating binding to more than one blocking site on the nmda receptor channel complex. the higher
affinity of  xxxd2090xxx  block of nmda receptors containing the nr2b subunit could be accounted for by more rapid
association and slower dissociation from these sites. we conclude that  xxxd2090xxx  exhibits modest selectivity for
nmda receptors composed of nr1a/nr2b subunits. this selectivity could, in part, account for the more favorable
clinical profile of  xxxd2090xxx  in comparison with nmda receptor antagonists that do not show subunit selectivity.

anticonvulsant activity by croucher et al. (1982).
since this original report, nmda receptor antagonists have been found to exhibit a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity in animal seizure
models and also to protect against kindling development (rogawski, 1992). the anticonvulsant
and antiepileptogenic actions of nmda receptor
antagonists have engendered considerable interest
in the potential utility of this class of drugs in

epilepsy therapy. however, in clinical trials,
nmda receptor antagonists have demonstrated
unacceptable neurobehavioral side effects that have
precluded further development (rogawski, 1998).
to date, the only marketed anticonvulsant agent
that exhibits nmda receptor blocking activity at
clinically relevant doses is the  xxxd18xxx 
dicarbamate  xxxd2090xxx  (de sarro et al., 1994; rho
et al., 1994; pisani et al., 1995; subramaniam et al.,
1995; corradetti and pugliese, 1998). although
 xxxd2090xxx  has idiosyncratic hematologic and hepatic toxicities that limit its use as a first-line agent
(pellock and brodie, 1997), the drug nevertheless
serves as an example of a clinically effective anticonvulsant with nmda receptor blocking activity
that possesses a low incidence of central nervous
system side effects. the basis for  xxxd2090xxx ’s more
favorable toxicity profile in comparison with other
nmda antagonists is not well understood. one
attractive hypothesis is that  xxxd2090xxx  could selectively target a subclass of nmda receptors.
nmda receptors in mammalian neurons are
believed to be heterooligomers formed by coassembly of an obligatory nr1 subunit and at least one
type of nr2 subunit (dingledine et al., 1999). four
nr2 subunits have been identified, each of which
exhibits a distinct regional distribution and developmental expression pattern. the four distinct
nr2 subunits confer unique pharmacological and
biophysical properties upon the nmda receptors
from which they are assembled.
to explore the possibility that  xxxd2090xxx ’s favorable toxicity profile could relate to subtype specificity, we examined its selectivity for block of
recombinant nmda receptors expressed in human
embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells. our results
demonstrate that  xxxd2090xxx  has modest selectivity
for nmda receptors containing the nr2b subunit. after the completion of this work, a study
appeared demonstrating similar results using an
oocyte expression system (kleckner et al., 1999).

2. materials and methods

2.1. cell culture and nmda receptor expression
hek 293 cells obtained from the american type

culture collection were grown in dulbecco’s modification of eagle’s medium (life technologies) at
37°c. cells were split 1–3 days before transfection
and plated at a density of 1–3× 105 cells/dish in
glass-bottomed 35-mm culture dishes (mattek)
coated with matrigel (collaborative biomedical
products). rat nmda receptor nr1a subunit
cdna, subcloned into the mammalian cell expression vector pcdm8, was obtained from dr robert
wenthold. the nr1a subunit is a splice variant of
the nr1 subunit containing the c1 and c2 c-terminal cassettes and lacking n-terminal exon 5.
mammalian cell expression vectors containing
 xxxg964xxx , nr2b and  xxxg966xxx  subunit cdna were
from dr peter seeburg. cotransfections of the
nr1a vector (1 mg/dish) and one of the nr2
vectors (3 mg/dish) were carried out with the capo4
method (chen and okayama, 1987) in the presence
of the nmda receptor antagonist (9 )-2-amino-5phosphonopentanoic acid (200 mm) to enhance cell
survival. an expression vector encoding an enhanced version of green fluorescent protein (ps65t;
clontech) was included to allow identification of
transfected cells (0.5 mg/dish). cells were incubated
with the transfection solution for 16–24 h. singlecell electrophysiology was performed 48–72 h following transfection.

2.2. electrophysiology
whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were
carried out at room temperature on the stage
of a nikon diaphot inverted microscope. just prior
to recording, the culture medium was replaced
with an extracellular recording solution containing
145 mm nacl, 2.5 mm kcl, 0.1 mm cacl2, 10
mm glucose, 32 mm sucrose and 10 mm hepes
(ph 7.4; 315–320 mosm). recording electrodes
were pulled from 1.5-mm thin wall glass tubing,
fire-polished and filled with intracellular solution
containing 145 mm cscl, 1 mm mgcl2, 0.1 mm
cacl2, 10 mm hepes, 1 mm egta and 17 mm
sucrose (ph 7.2; 305–310 mosm). electrode resistances were 2–5 mv. current signals were amplified with an axopatch 200a patch-clamp
amplifier (axon instruments), filtered at 1 khz
with a low-pass bessel filter and digitized  xxxd1891xxx 
khz with a digidata 1200a analog-to-digital con-

verter (axon). series resistance errors were not
compensated. cells expressing the ps65t-encoded
fluorescent protein were identified by fluorescence
microscopy using an fitc filter system (485 nm
excitation and 530 nm emission).

2.3. solution application and dose– response
analysis
test solutions were applied using a gravity-fed,
multibarrel, fast perfusion system, as described
previously (donevan and rogawski, 1993).
the device provides a continuous flow of solution
onto the cell under study and allows rapid
switching between solutions that exit from a
common orifice. during the experiment, fresh
bathing solution was continuously applied via the
perfusion system. nmda currents were
evoked with 5 s applications of extracellular
recording solution to which 50 mm nmda and
10 mm glycine had been added (‘nmda solution’). for construction of dose – response curves,
a three-part protocol was used consisting of sequential 5 s applications of nmda solution,
nmda plus  xxxd2090xxx , and nmda alone. experiments were discarded if the recovery current
amplitude was b 90% of the initial current. fractional block was determined as b = 1 − if/ic,
where ic is the maximum amplitude of the
nmda current immediately prior to the onset of
the  xxxd2090xxx  application and if is the amplitude
of the nmda-evoked current at the end of 5 s
applications of  xxxd2090xxx . fractional block was
plotted as a function of  xxxd2090xxx  concentration,
and these data points were fit with the logistic
equation
b= 1/{1 +([ xxxd2090xxx ]/ic50)nh}
where [ xxxd2090xxx ] is the concentration of  xxxd2090xxx , ic50 is the theoretical concentration of  xxxd2090xxx  producing 50% inhibition, and nh is a
slope factor having the same significance as the
hill coefficient. due to inability to reliably solubilize  xxxd2090xxx  at concentrations greater than 3
mm, we could not determine the maximal  xxxd2090xxx  inhibition. however, the logistic equation
used for the fits assumes a theoretical maximal
fractional block of 1. statistical comparisons were

49

made using pharm/pcs version 4.2 (microcomputer specialists).

2.4. kinetic analysis
double exponential growth or decay functions
were fit to the current traces using the levenberg–marquardt nonlinear curve-fitting function
of origin 5.0 (microcal software). determination
of the goodness of fit was made by leastsquares analysis. the decision to reject single exponential fits in favor of double exponential fits
was based on comparisons of the mean least
squares values using the t-test at the 0.05 level of
significance.

2.5. chemicals
 xxxd2090xxx  was a gift of dr r. duane sofia
(wallace laboratories). nmda was from research biochemicals international. all other
chemicals were from sigma chemical co.

3. results

3.1. nmda responses in transfected cells
cells expressing green fluorescent protein and
having little or no contact with surrounding cells
were chosen for recording. perfusion with 50 mm
nmda (+10 mm glycine) evoked inward current
responses that were 400–2000 pa in amplitude
for cells expressing the nr1a/ xxxg964xxx  subunit
combination, 100–1000 pa for the nr1a/nr2b
subunit combination, and 50–200 pa for the
nr1a/ xxxg966xxx  subunit combination.

3.2.  xxxd2090xxx  block of nmda receptor currents
coapplication of  xxxd2090xxx  at concentrations of
0.1–3.0 mm with nmda (+ 10 mm glycine)
resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the amplitude of the nmda-evoked currents in cells
expressing the nr1a/ xxxg964xxx , nr1a/nr2b and
nr1a/ xxxg966xxx  subunit combinations (fig. 1). onset of block was rapid (less than 1 s), and recovery

from block was essentially complete within
5 s. qualitatively, at each  xxxd2090xxx  concentration, the level of block obtained with the
nr1a/nr2 and nr1a/ xxxg966xxx  subunit combinations was similar, whereas there was greater
block of currents in the nr1a/nr2b expressing
cells.
for each of the three subunit combinations, the
fractional block of nmda receptor currents was
assessed in six to eight experiments similar to
those of fig. 1. fractional block values were
determined at the end of 5 s  xxxd2090xxx  coapplications. in each experiment, the fractional block
values for  xxxd2090xxx  concentrations within the
range 0.03–3 mm were plotted as a function of
drug concentration and fit according to the logistic equation. the mean ic50 and nh values from
these fits are presented in table 1. for illustration, the group mean fractional block values are
plotted in fig. 2 with corresponding fits.  xxxd2090xxx  demonstrated modest selectivity for nmda
receptors composed of nr1a/nr2b subunits,
while receptors with the  xxxg964xxx  or  xxxg966xxx  subunits
had similar affinities for the drug. the relative

potencies for nr1a/nr2b were 4.92 versus
nr1a/ xxxg964xxx  and 4.62 versus nr1a/ xxxg966xxx ; the
relative potency for nr1a/ xxxg964xxx  versus nr1a/

of  xxxd2090xxx  at the indicated concentrations in six to eight

at high concentrations. ic50 (nh) values for the  xxxg964xxx , nr2b
and  xxxg966xxx  fits were 2.3 (0.78), 0.6 (0.86) and 2.0 (0.78),
respectively.

 xxxg966xxx  was 1.06. in each case, the nh values were
significantly b 1.

3.3. kinetics of block
time constants for onset and recovery from
 xxxd2090xxx  block were determined by fitting the
current trajectories during onset and recovery
from  xxxd2090xxx  blocking responses (fig. 3). onset
of block was not well fit by a single exponential
function, but could be adequately fit by the sum
of two exponential functions. for  xxxd2090xxx  concentrations of 0.3–3 mm, the fast time constants
were in the range 100 – 180 ms and the slow time
constants were in the range 500 – 2000 ms. the
fast component typically accounted for  55% of
the amplitude of the fits. recovery from block
was also better fit by the sum of two exponential
functions, with fast time constants in the range
70 – 200 ms and slow time constants in the range
400 – 1200 ms. the fast component typically accounted for about two-thirds of the amplitude of
the fits. the fast perfusion system used in these

51

experiments allows solutions changes to be made
on the order of b 10 ms (donevan and rogawski, 1993). consequently, measurements of
onset and recovery from block can be used to
estimate binding association and dissociation rate
constants. fast and slow association (k1f, k1s) and
dissociation (k − 1f, k − 1s) rate constants for onset
and recovery from block for each of the three
subunit combinations are summarized in table 2.
it is apparent that the fast and slow association
rate constants for the nr1a/nr2b subunit combination are greater than the corresponding rate
constants for the nr1a/ xxxg964xxx  and nr1a/ xxxg966xxx 
subunit combinations. similarly, the fast and slow
dissociation rate constants for the nr1a/nr2b
subunit are slower than those of the other subunit
combinations. assuming that the fast and slow
components represent binding to distinct sites, the
affinity constants for binding to these sites can be
estimated as kd = k − 1/k1. the calculated fast and
slow affinity constants for each of the three subunit combinations are: nr1a/ xxxg964xxx , 2.7 and 3.7
mm; nr1a/nr2b, 0.3 and 0.5 mm; nr1a/
 xxxg966xxx , 1.1 and 1.0 mm. the kinetically determined affinities at each site compare favorably
with the equilibrium affinities determined by dose
titration, as summarized in table 1. thus, as is
the case with equilibrium ic50 values, the kinetically determined binding affinity of  xxxd2090xxx  for
the nr1a/nr2b subunit combination is higher
than for the other two subunit combinations. for
each of the subunit combinations, the affinities for
the fast and slow sites are comparable. therefore,
at any  xxxd2090xxx  concentration, equilibrium block
occurs by substantial binding to the sites represented by the fast and slow components.

4. discussion
this study confirms that the antiepileptic drug
 xxxd2090xxx  is an effective antagonist of nmda
receptors expressed in mammalian cells. the work
extends the original demonstration in our laboratory that  xxxd2090xxx  blocks native nmda receptors expressed in rat forebrain and hippocampal
cultures (rho et al., 1994; subramaniam et al.,
1995), and complements a recent study demon-

52

strating  xxxd2090xxx  block of recombinant nmda
receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes (kleckner
et al., 1999). this nmda receptor blocking action of  xxxd2090xxx  is in addition to its effects on
gabaa receptors that occur within the same
range of concentrations (rho et al., 1994, 1997).
 xxxd2090xxx  inhibited nmda receptors composed
of the nr1a subunit and either of the  xxxg964xxx ,
nr2b or  xxxg966xxx  subunits. however, the drug was
modestly more potent as an antagonist of nmda
receptors containing the nr2b subunit. kinetic
analyses of the blocking data demonstrated that
the increased affinity of nr1a/nr2b receptors is
the result of both enhanced rates of association
and diminished rates of dissociation. the absolute
and relative potencies for block in the present
study (table 1) compares favorably with those
reported for oocyte recordings, where the ic50
values for block of receptors containing the
 xxxg964xxx , nr2b and  xxxg966xxx  subunits were 8.56,
0.93 and 2.02, respectively (kleckner et al., 1999).
for all three subunit combinations, the blocking action of  xxxd2090xxx  occurred in a concentration-dependent fashion. the slope factors in fits to
the concentration–block data were less than 1
(table 1). these fits must be interpreted with
caution since fractional block values at high con-

centrations were not available due to the limited
solubility of the drug. nevertheless, the low slope
factor suggests the existence of more than one
blocking site. in line with this possibility, both
onset and recovery from block occurred in two
exponential phases compatible with drug binding
to two distinct blocking sites (or in two distinct
orientations to the same binding site where interconversion is not possible). it is interesting that
the estimated affinities for binding to the kinetically fast and slow sites were comparable so that
equilibrium block occurs by binding to both sites.
although we have interpreted our data under the
assumption that all expressed nmda receptors
are identical, it is conceivable that the fast and
slow sites could also correspond with distinct
nmda receptors composed of different numbers
or configurations of nr1a and nr2 subunits.
 xxxd2090xxx  affinity, as determined in the equilibrium block experiments and also by the kinetic
analyses, was greater for the nr1a/nr2b subunit
combination than for the other two subunit combinations. the nr2b selectivity of  xxxd2090xxx  is
shared by a variety of nmda antagonists, including the phenylethylamine  xxxd2326xxx  and related compounds such as eliprodil, cp101,606, ro
25-6981 and nylidrin (avenet et al., 1997; brime-

was coapplied with nmda during the periods indicated by the solid bars. the points following onset (left) or termination (right)
of the  xxxd2090xxx  applications were fit with second-order exponential functions. the fast and slow time constant values for onset of
block were, respectively, 109 and 1471 ms for 0.3 mm  xxxd2090xxx , and 83 and 574 ms for 3 mm  xxxd2090xxx ; the corresponding values
for recovery were 210 and 930 ms, and 150 and 1377 ms. in all cases, the amplitude of the fast component represented  55% of
the total amplitude.

rate constants were determined from double exponential fits to the onset and recovery of  xxxd2090xxx  block in three to six cells
with  xxxd2090xxx  concentrations of 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mm, except for the  xxxg966xxx  subunit, where the data with 0.3 mm  xxxd2090xxx  could
not be fit. forward rate constants were calculated from mean onset time constant values according to the formula k1 =1/
(t1[ xxxd2090xxx ]), where t1 is the fast or slow time constant value and [ xxxd2090xxx ] is the concentration of  xxxd2090xxx ; reverse rate
constants were calculated from mean offset time constants as k−1 =1/t−1. subscripts f and s indicate fast and slow components,
respectively. values at different concentrations were averaged.

combe et al., 1997; fischer et al., 1997; whittemore et al., 1997; mott et al., 1998; mutel et al.,
1998; tamiz et al., 1998), the butyrophenones
haloperidol,  xxxd1945xxx  and spiperone (brimecombe et al., 1998; gallagher et al., 1998; yamakura et al., 1998), and the novel glycine-site
antagonist cgp 61594 (honer et al., 1998). the
fivefold selectivity of  xxxd2090xxx  is far less than
that of these antagonists. if nr2b selectivity contributes to  xxxd2090xxx ’s enhanced tolerability in
relation to other nmda receptor antagonists,
then these highly selective antagonists might be
expected to be particularly favorable as anticonvulsants. there is no evidence that this is the case,
possibly because the anticonvulsant utility of
many of these more nr2b-selective compounds is
hampered by diverse actions on receptors and ion
channels unrelated to the nmda receptor (ebert
et al., 1997; wlaź et al., 1999). as additional,
more specific nr2b-selective agents become
available, it will be of interest to examine their
anticonvulsant properties to determine if nr2b
selectivity is associated with enhanced tolerability
for an nmda receptor blocking anticonvulsant.
despite several recent studies, the precise mechanism whereby  xxxd2090xxx  blocks nmda receptors is not yet fully understood. early reports
suggested that  xxxd2090xxx  may act as a competitive
antagonist at the glycine recognition site of
nmda receptors (mccabe et al., 1993; wamsley
et al., 1994). although various experiments in
animal models showing a functional reversal of

the anticonvulsant action of  xxxd2090xxx  by glycine
site ligands were consistent with this possibility
(coffin et al., 1994; white et al., 1995), detailed
studies using biophysical methods of analysis have
shown conclusively that  xxxd2090xxx  is not a glycine
site antagonist (rho et al., 1994; kanthasamy et
al., 1995; subramaniam et al., 1995; taylor et al.,
1995; kleckner et al., 1999). indeed, it has recently been reported that  xxxd2090xxx  produces a
robust increase in [3h]glycine binding to nmda
receptors (mccabe et al., 1998). thus, while  xxxd2090xxx  does not compete at the glycine recognition site, it nevertheless does appear to
allosterically modulate glycine site binding.
single channel recording studies are consistent
with a functional channel blocking action of the
drug or allosteric effects on channel gating (rho
et al., 1994; subramaniam et al., 1995).  xxxd2090xxx 
is a neutral molecule. thus, if it were a pore
blocker, it would not be expected to exhibit the
strong voltage-dependence characteristic of many
charged nmda receptor channel blockers. indeed, in voltage-clamp recordings, the blocking
action of  xxxd2090xxx  exhibited minimal (subramaniam et al., 1995) or no voltage dependence
(kleckner et al., 1999). detailed analysis of single
channel recordings indicated that the predominant action of  xxxd2090xxx  is to cause a reduction in
the channel open time and burst duration, in
association with only a small decrease in single
channel amplitude (rho et al., 1994; subramaniam et al., 1995). interestingly, such actions are

54

t.p. harty, m.a. rogawski / epilepsy research 39 (2000) 47–55

reminiscent of other nr2b-selective ligands including  xxxd2326xxx  (legendre and westbrook,
1991), cp101,606 (brimecombe et al., 1997, 1998)
and haloperidol (ilyin et al., 1996; brimecombe
et al., 1998). whether  xxxd2090xxx  blocks nmda
receptors by an allosteric mechanism similar
to that of these more selective nr2b antagonists remains to be determined. however, several observations in the recent study of kleckner
et al. (1999) appear to indicate important
differences, including the findings: (i) that a mutation of glutamate 201 in nr2b which dramatically decreases the affinity of haloperidol
(gallagher et al., 1998) and cp101,606 (brimecombe et al., 1998) had only a small effect on
 xxxd2090xxx  blocking potency; and (ii) that low ph
which markedly enhances  xxxd2326xxx  and
cp101,606 potency (mott et al., 1998) had no
effect on  xxxd2090xxx  inhibition of nr1a/nr2b
receptors.
in conclusion, nr2b selectivity could in part
contribute to  xxxd2090xxx ’s low neurobehavioral
toxicity in relation to other nmda receptor antagonists, and could also account for its clinical
utility in seizure disorders affecting the immature
brain. unlike the  xxxg964xxx  subunit that is distributed ubiquitously in the central nervous system, expression of the nr2b subunit in the adult
is largely restricted to the forebrain (mori and
mishina, 1995). thus,  xxxd2090xxx  may target
nmda receptor-mediated synaptic transmission
in forebrain areas critical to seizure generation
and avoid perturbing nonforebrain structures that
could mediate side effects. the utility of  xxxd2090xxx 
in childhood epilepsies such as the lennox – gastaut syndrome (anonymous, 1993) may be related
to the abundance of nr2b subunits in the developing brain. thus, the unique pharmacological
profile of  xxxd2090xxx  as an nmda receptor
antagonist could, in part, contribute to its distinctive clinical characteristics as an anticonvulsant
drug.
