abstract
the kinase  xxxg1364xxx  ( xxxg1364xxx ) has recently been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. thus, selective inhibition of
 xxxg1364xxx  may be a novel strategy for cancer therapy. to identify inhibitors of  xxxg1364xxx  kinase activity, we have developed a
novel activity assay for  xxxg1364xxx  based on the discovery that recombinant purified  xxxg1364xxx  has intrinsic atpase activity.
this  xxxg1364xxx  atpase assay was validated for enzyme identity and enzymatic purity by multiple methods including mass
spectrometry analysis, testing different sources of  xxxg1364xxx  and comparing atpase assay ic50 data for multiple inhibitors to
literature values and to ic50 data generated using  xxxg1364xxx  binding and transphosphorylation assays. taken together, these
data indicated that genuine  xxxg1364xxx  activity was being measured in this assay and no other atpases contributed to the signal.
a miniaturized version of the assay was validated for high-throughput screening, and compound libraries were screened.
the screening hits generated comparable potencies in the  xxxg1364xxx  intrinsic atpase, binding, and transphosphorylation
assays. we identified a novel  xxxg1364xxx  inhibitor and confirmed that  xxxd1761xxx  and  xxxd359xxx  are potent in vitro inhibitors of
 xxxg1364xxx  activity with ic50 values of <100 nm. thus, this assay has utility for the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of
 xxxg1364xxx  activity.

introduction
mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk) are critical
cell-signaling components that transduce extracellular
stimuli to the nucleus, ultimately leading to changes in gene
expression.1,2 erk5 is a mapk that is activated by a number of growth factors, oxidative stress, and hyperosmolarity.3 disruption of the erk5 gene in mice resulted in
embryonic lethality due to defects in cardiac development
and angiogenesis.4 erk5 protects many cell types from
stress-induced apoptosis.3,5,6 mek5 is the only map2k for
the erk5 pathway.7 mek5 gene knockout in mice was
lethal and resulted in abnormal cardiac development, similar in phenotype to the erk5 knockout mouse.7 the only
defined map3ks for the erk5 pathway are  xxxg1364xxx 
( xxxg1364xxx ) and mekk3 (map3k3).8,9 these kinases
phosphorylate mek5 and activate its activity. disruption of
the  xxxg1364xxx  gene in mice resulted in normal development
and fertility.10,11 in contrast, the disruption of mekk3
resulted in embryonic lethality due to cardiac development
defects that mimicked the erk5 knockout phenotype.12
thus, the different phenotypes of these transgenic animals
demonstrate that these two map3ks integrate different

stimuli.  xxxg1364xxx  activates both the erk5 and jnk pathways.10,13  xxxg1364xxx  has been observed to autophosphorylate
in response to stimuli, and this autophosphorylation is
required for activation of  xxxg1364xxx .14
the role of the erk5 pathway in cancer has only relatively recently been explored. expression of erk5 in a
panel of 84 human early-stage breast cancer tissue samples

was examined, and overexpression of erk5 was found in
20% of the samples.15 overexpression of erk5 correlated
with a decrease in disease-free survival time. in a similar
study done with prostate cancer, erk5 expression was significantly increased in high-grade prostate cancer compared
with benign prostatic hyperplasia.16,17 analysis of erk5
expression in samples taken before and after hormone
relapse showed a correlation with erk5 activation and
hormone-insensitive disease.17 erk5 overexpression in
 xxxg1682xxx  cells resulted in more efficient tumor formation in
mice. in another study, a dominant negative form of erk5
restricted the proliferation of myeloma cells and sensitized
the cells to apoptosis-inducing drugs.18 in a recent study,
mir-143 was shown to be a tumor suppressor in prostate
cancer using a mouse model.19 one of the mechanisms of
mir-143 appears to be suppression of erk5 protein expression. activation of the erk5 pathway, but not the  xxxg1369xxx 
pathway, was correlated with lymph node metastasis in oral
squamous cell carcinoma.20 a potent and selective erk5
inhibitor has been reported that inhibited tumor growth in
an in vivo mouse cancer model.21 mek5 has also been
implicated in tumor development. mek5 expression was
determined in 127 cases of prostate cancer and 20 cases of
benign prostatic hypertrophy.22 the data indicated that elevated expression of mek5 correlated with bone metastasis
and poor prognosis. in one study linking  xxxg1364xxx  to cancer,
11 prostate cancer tissue samples were compared with uninvolved prostate tissue using imaging mass spectrometry
(ms).16 one peptide was found to discriminate cancer from
uninvolved tissue. this peptide was a fragment of  xxxg1364xxx .
in confirmation of the ms data,  xxxg1364xxx  was expressed at
4.4-fold higher level in prostate cancer tissue versus benign
tissue using western blotting. even higher levels of  xxxg1364xxx 
expression were observed in lncap, du145, and  xxxg1682xxx  prostate cell lines.
we have recently examined the role of  xxxg1364xxx  in tumor
growth and metastasis using an in vivo mouse xenograft
model for breast cancer.23 we found that shrna-mediated
knockdown of  xxxg1364xxx  inhibited activation of erk5 in
response to  xxxg681xxx  (egf) in the breast
cancer cell line mda-mb-231. knockdown of  xxxg1364xxx 
expression strongly inhibited both tumor growth and metastasis. increased apoptosis was observed with the loss of
 xxxg1364xxx  expression in xenografts versus size-matched control tumors, even though growth of  xxxg1364xxx  knockdown
cells in culture was unaffected.  xxxg1364xxx  shrna knockdown in the bt474 cell line also resulted in inhibited tumor
growth in xenografts. thus,  xxxg1364xxx  is critical for egfrand her2/neu  xxxg2198xxx –dependent erk5 activation,
tumor growth of both mda-mb-231 and bt474 cells, and
metastasis of mda-mb-231 cells. because  xxxg1364xxx  is
required for egfr activation of erk5, we assessed
whether knockdown of erk5 in mda-mb-231 cells would
show similar tumor growth and metastasis phenotypes as

with  xxxg1364xxx  knockdown. erk5 knockdown resulted in a
decrease in metastasis without a significant effect on tumor
growth. thus,  xxxg1364xxx  regulation of erk5 is only one arm
of  xxxg1364xxx  signaling controlling tumor growth and metastasis. these results further support  xxxg1364xxx  as a novel target for small-molecule inhibitor development.
kinase intrinsic atpase activity is the hydrolysis of atp to
adp and phosphate in the absence of a phosphate-accepting
substrate. intrinsic atpase activity has been observed for a
number of kinases using in vitro biochemical assays and purified kinase. this atpase activity has been described for several mapks, including  xxxg1368xxx , p38gamma,  xxxg1366xxx ,  xxxg1367xxx , and
 xxxg1361xxx .24,25 a format comparison study compared screening
results using an antibody-based disassociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoroimmunoassay, an atp-consumption intrinsic
atpase assay, and a fluorescence polarization binding assay
for itk.26 the authors concluded that the intrinsic atpase
assay identified the most comprehensive set of inhibitors from
screening. in another study using  xxxg1745xxx , ic50 data for a panel
of inhibitors generated using an intrinsic atpase assay were
similar to data generated by a lipid phosphorylation assay.27
we have discovered that  xxxg1364xxx  has intrinsic atpase
activity and have developed a high-throughput  xxxg1364xxx 
activity assay based on this property. multiple methods
were employed to demonstrate that genuine  xxxg1364xxx  activity was being measured and no other atpase activities contributed to the assay signal. in addition, a miniaturized
version of the assay was validated for high-throughput
screening (hts), and compound libraries were screened.
using this assay, a novel  xxxg1364xxx  inhibitor was identified,
and  xxxd1761xxx  and  xxxd359xxx  were confirmed to inhibit
 xxxg1364xxx  activity with ic50 values of <100 nm.

scientific (union city, ca), biovision (milpitas, ca),
toronto research chemicals (toronto canada), and
symansis (shanghai, china). the validation set of compounds for test screening was obtained from prestwick
chemical (washington, dc). the kinase-focused library of
compounds was obtained from the center for integrative
chemical biology and drug discovery at the university of
north carolina at chapel hill (chapel hill, nc).
recombinant purified  xxxg1364xxx  enzyme was obtained from
signalchem (richmond, bc, canada; vendor 1), invitrogen
(grand island, ny; vendor 2), and carna bioscience (kobe,
japan; vendor 3). we used the  xxxg1364xxx  enzyme from
signalchem (vendor 1) to generate the data shown in this
report unless otherwise indicated. lanthascreen eu-antiglutathione s-transferase (gst) antibody (cat no. pv5594)
and kinase tracer 236 (cat no. pv5592) used in the binding
assays were obtained from invitrogen. protease digestion
and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of
flight/time of flight (maldi-tof/tof) analysis of the
 xxxg1364xxx  solution was performed by the proteomics core
facility, unc-chapel hill.

 xxxg1364xxx  intrinsic atpase activity assay
all compound stock solutions were made in 100% dmso.
serial dilutions of compounds for ic50 determinations were
initially performed in 100% dmso in 96-well polypropylene plates, followed by appropriate dilutions in assay buffer
(50 mm hepes, ph 7.4, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm egta,
0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm beta-glycerophosphate,
2.5 mm dtt, and 0.01% triton x-100), producing a constant 2.5% dmso in all wells. subsequently, 10 µl of the
diluted compound (or just 2.5% dmso in assay buffer for
controls) was added to the wells of a 96-well plate followed
by 10 µl of  xxxg1364xxx  enzyme diluted in assay buffer. after
a 10-min incubation, the reactions were initiated by addition of 5 µl of atp (150 µm ultrapure atp from promega
kit) diluted in assay buffer, and the assay plates were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min in a beckman coulter
allegra x-12r centrifuge. final concentrations in the
assembled standard assay were as follows: 1x assay buffer,
1% dmso, 30 µm atp, and 10 nm  xxxg1364xxx  enzyme. the
enzyme reactions were allowed to proceed protected from
light for 75 min at 23 °c and terminated by the addition of
25 µl of solution 1 (adp-glo reagent, promega). at this
point, assay plates were centrifuged again as described
above and incubated at 23 °c for an hour. a 50 µl volume
of solution 2 (detection reagent) of the promega kit was
added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at
23 °c, protected from light. the plates were read using an
endpoint luminescence protocol (measurement interval
time: 1.0 s, optic module: lum plus, gain: 3600, focal
height: 13.7 mm, positional delay: 0.1 s) in a bmg

pherastar (bmg labtech, cary, nc) plate reader.
luminescence data, expressed in relative luminescence
units (rlu), were normalized to dmso (100% activity)
and “no enzyme” (0% activity) controls as maximum and
minimum responses, respectively.
for all  xxxg1364xxx  assay formats, compound concentrationresponse curves were generated using data points that represent the average of three determinations per concentration,
except for the transphosphorylation assay, in which duplicate determinations were performed. all ic50 values provided in this report are averages of at least three independent
determinations. the ic50 values and hill slopes were calculated from concentration-response data using graphpad
prism software (graphpad software inc., la jolla, ca)
employing either a four-parameter or a three-parameter
(fixed bottom) curve fit.

high-throughput  xxxg1364xxx  activity assay
the activity assay described above was readily adapted to
an automated 384-well assay version in which handling of
compound dilutions, delivery of reagents, and mixing was
performed on a biomek nx (beckman coulter inc.,
fullerton, ca) and a nanoscreen nsx 1536 (charleston,
sc). the automated assay was carried out exactly as the
manual assay including incubation times and centrifugation
with the following modifications. 2.5 µl of enzyme solution was added to 384-well white solid low-volume assay
plates. compounds of 50 nl in 100% dmso (or 100%
dmso as controls) were added to each well using a v&p
scientific pin tool (san diego, ca). after 10 min, 2.5 µl of
ultrapure atp was added to each well, bringing the final
assay volume to 5 µl. the reaction was terminated by addition of 5 µl of solution 1 (adp-glo), and following 60
minutes of incubation, 10 µl of solution 2 (detection
reagent) was added. the plates were sealed with mylar
plate seals (thermo, milford, ma) during incubations. the
kinase inhibitor library was screened at 5 µm concentration, and compounds with ≥50% inhibition were considered
hits. z′-factor calculations were performed as published.28

 xxxg1364xxx  tr-fret binding assay
compound dilution methods and assay buffer was the same
for the  xxxg1364xxx  time-resolved fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (tr-fret) binding assay as in the atpase
assay. the assay was performed according to the antibody
and tracer manufacturer’s recommendations (invitrogen).
briefly, 5 µl of diluted compounds (or 3% dmso for controls) were added to wells of a solid white low-volume
384-well plate followed by 5 µl of a mixture of  xxxg1364xxx 
enzyme and lanthascreen eu-anti-gst antibody diluted in
assay buffer. immediately after addition of the enzymeantibody mixture, the reaction mixtures were completed by

the addition of 5 µl of kinase tracer 236 diluted in assay
buffer. the assay plates were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm
for 1 min as before and incubated for 60 min at 23 °c. final
concentrations in the assembled assay were as follows: 1%
dmso, 2 nm lanthascreen eu-anti-gst antibody, 25 nm
kinase tracer, and 5 nm  xxxg1364xxx  enzyme. time-resolved
fluorescence was measured using a bmg pherastar with
the following parameters: number of flashes per well: 300,
optic module: htrf, excitation: 337 nm, emission a: 665
nm, emission b: 620 nm, integration start (µs): 100, integration time (µs): 200, focal length: 10.3 mm, ratio multiplier: 1000, positional delay: 0.1. the tr-fret signal was
calculated by determining the ratio of relative fluorescence
units obtained at 665 nm and 620 nm (665 nm/620 nm) and
subsequently normalizing the value to dmso (100% activity) and 30 µm  xxxd1815xxx  (0% activity) controls as maximum and minimum responses, respectively.

 xxxg1364xxx  transphosphorylation activity assay
the  xxxg1364xxx  transphosphorylation activity assay and ic50
determinations were performed as described for the atpase
assay, except the reactions were initiated by a mixture of
atp and kinase-inactive mutant mkk6 (map2k6, carna
biosciences). final concentrations in the enzyme reactions
were 2 nm  xxxg1364xxx , 200 nm mkk6, and 3 µm atp. the
reaction time was 25 min, and the reactions were stopped
by the addition of 225 µl of stop buffer (25 mm hepes,
ph 7.4, 10 mm edta). these reactions were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a slot
blot apparatus (hoefer pr 648) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. the membrane was allowed to dry
and then probed with an anti-phosphomkk6 antibody
(phospho- xxxg1363xxx  [ser189]/mkk6 [ser207] [22a8] rabbit
monoclonal antibody; cell signaling, danvers, ma) using
a standard western blotting protocol.29

results
characterization of  xxxg1364xxx  intrinsic atpase
activity
we sought to develop a high-throughput activity assay for
 xxxg1364xxx  to identify small-molecule inhibitors of this kinase.
using a sensitive chemiluminescent adp detection assay
(adp-glo kit, promega), we observed atpase activity using
purified recombinant  xxxg1364xxx  enzyme in the absence of any
protein substrate. this atpase activity increased in a linear
fashion directly proportional to the concentration of  xxxg1364xxx 
in the reaction up to 10 nm (fig. 1a). atpase activity was
readily detected even at 1 nm  xxxg1364xxx . reaction time course
studies with 10 nm  xxxg1364xxx  demonstrated a linear assay
signal increase from 0 to 90 min (fig. 1b). thus, we chose
final reaction conditions of 10 nm  xxxg1364xxx  and a reaction

time of 75 min. the km for atp was determined by performing reactions with variable concentrations of atp with and
without  xxxg1364xxx  (fig. 1c). reactions without  xxxg1364xxx  were
taken as background and subtracted from the signal obtained
with enzyme to obtain specific rlu. the average km value
was 34 µm, and thus, we chose to use 30 µm atp for the
final assay. we also used pure adp to determine a standard
curve (data not shown). under final standard assay conditions, we calculated that approximately 3 µm adp was
generated, translating into a 10% substrate conversion (atp
to adp). the activity observed in this assay is unlikely to be
 xxxg1364xxx  autophosphorylation activity based on the ratio of
the amount of product formed to the  xxxg1364xxx  enzyme concentration. because there is only 10 nm  xxxg1364xxx  and 3000
nm adp generated during the course of the reaction, each
molecule of  xxxg1364xxx  would have to be autophosphorylated
300 times, roughly twice the sum of all the serine, threonine,
and tyrosine residues in the gst- xxxg1364xxx  construct. because
this assay would be used to test compounds dissolved in
dmso, the dmso tolerance of the assay was assessed
(fig. 1d). up to 8% dmso was tolerated in the assay without significant effect. the final dmso concentration in the
reaction under final assay conditions was set at 1% dmso.

validation of the identity and enzymatic
purity of  xxxg1364xxx  in the intrinsic atpase
activity assay
we purchased purified recombinant human  xxxg1364xxx  and
confirmed its identity by mass spectrometry analysis. the
entire  xxxg1364xxx  enzyme (vendor 1) solution was subjected
to enzymatic digestion followed by maldi tof/tof ms
analysis of the resulting peptides. peptides matching human
 xxxg1364xxx  were observed, but no other peptides were
detected (data not shown).
nonselective assay formats, such as measuring adp
generation for kinase assays, require an extra amount of
enzymatic purity validation to prove that the target activity,
and only that activity, is being measured. we used several
experimental approaches to validate that the observed
atpase activity was due to  xxxg1364xxx  and only  xxxg1364xxx . in
one approach, we obtained purified recombinant human
 xxxg1364xxx  from three different vendors because if contamination was the source of activity, then it is less likely (though
possible) that the all three sources would have the same
contaminating atpase at the same concentration or activity
level. we demonstrated that all three sources of  xxxg1364xxx 
had time-dependent atpase activity with similar specific
activities, because they were all tested  xxxd1891xxx  nm  xxxg1364xxx 
(fig. 2a). furthermore, we used sunitinib as a control
inhibitor to determine its potency using all three sources of
 xxxg1364xxx  (fig. 2b). the concentration-response data produced average ic50 values and standard deviations (sds) of

figure 1.  xxxg1364xxx  intrinsic atpase activity assay characterization. (a) assay signal in response to  xxxg1364xxx  enzyme concentration was
assessed. (b) assay signal linearity with respect to reaction times, as indicated, was determined. (c) the km for atp was determined using
different concentrations of atp as indicated, with and without  xxxg1364xxx . signal obtained without  xxxg1364xxx  was taken as assay background for
each atp concentration tested.this value was subtracted from the respective assay signal with  xxxg1364xxx  to obtain specific rlu values. (d)
the assay signal at the indicated concentrations of dmso was determined. data points represent the average of three determinations
per variable, and error bars represent standard deviation. data are representative of three independent experiments.

337 ± 157, 184 ± 80, and 315 ± 199 nm for  xxxg1364xxx  from
vendors 1, 2, and 3, respectively. the sunitinib potencies
were all within twofold of each other, and therefore, these
data suggested that the same enzyme activity was being
measured in all three sources of  xxxg1364xxx . when inhibiting
a single enzyme in any biochemical assay, a hill slope of
1.0 is indicative of the measurement of a single enzyme,
versus multiple enzymes that could be present and detected
in the assay. broad (<1) slopes may indicate that more than
one enzyme is being measured in the assay. thus, we also
analyzed the hill slope data from these ic50 curves. the
average hill slope values and sds from these inhibitor
curves were 1.06 ± 0.16, 1.01 ± 0.02, and 1.01 ± 0.05 for
vendors 1, 2, and 3, respectively. the slopes for the different  xxxg1364xxx  sources were very close to 1.0, indicating that
a single atpase enzyme was being measured and inhibited
in all three sources of  xxxg1364xxx . sunitinib also demonstrated
complete inhibition of activity at high compound concentrations (fig. 2b), which is also expected for measurement

of a single enzyme activity. it should also be noted that vendor 3  xxxg1364xxx  is different from the other two in that the
vendor 3 protein construct consists of only the catalytic
domain of  xxxg1364xxx . these data from different sources of
 xxxg1364xxx  indicate that  xxxg1364xxx  has intrinsic atpase activity
in vitro. vendor 1  xxxg1364xxx  was used for all experimental
data and screening shown and cited in this report, except as
indicated in figure 2.
we further validated that the assay was measuring genuine  xxxg1364xxx  activity and not a contaminant atpase or
kinase by using a panel of four kinase inhibitors for inhibitor-based enzymatic purity studies. inhibitor concentrationresponse curves were generated for sunitinib,  xxxd1815xxx ,
vx-680, and  xxxd3241xxx  using the intrinsic atpase
activity assay (fig. 2c). sunitinib,  xxxd1815xxx , and vx-680
generated ic50 values (nm) and sds of 337 ± 157, 753 ±
268, and 3603 ± 826, respectively (table 1). these values
are comparable (within threefold and the same rank order)
to data provided by invitrogen using their  xxxg1364xxx

figure 2. intrinsic atpase activity observed from different sources of purified  xxxg1364xxx  and used to determine ic50 values for a panel
of kinase inhibitors. (a) intrinsic atpase assay reaction time courses were performed using three different sources of purified  xxxg1364xxx 
obtained from three different vendors: vendor 1(), vendor 2 (), and vendor 3 (). (b) concentration-response data for sunitinib were
normalized to controls with and without enzyme and plotted as percentage activity. these ic50 value determinations resulted in average
ic50 values of 337, 184, and 315 nm using  xxxg1364xxx  from vendor 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and average hill slopes of 1.0 to 1.1 as indicated.
(c) concentration-response data for a panel of kinase inhibitors were normalized to controls with and without  xxxg1364xxx  and plotted as
percentage activity. potency determinations for sunitinib (),  xxxd1815xxx  (•), vx-680 (), and  xxxd3241xxx  () resulted in average ic50
values (nm) and sds of 337 ± 157, 753 ± 268, 3603 ± 826, and 1.0 ± 0.6, respectively. the average hill slope values derived from the ic50
curves for these compounds ranged from 0.93 to 1.10. data points represent the average of three determinations per concentration, and
error bars represent standard deviation. data are representative of three independent experiments.

tr-fret binding assay (lanthascreen; table 1).  xxxd3241xxx  is a very potent inhibitor of  xxxg1364xxx  and behaved as
a tight binding inhibitor in the atpase assay. therefore, the
 xxxg1364xxx  concentration in the reaction was reduced to 1 nm
to obtain valid ic50 and hill slope data for  xxxd3241xxx .
titration of  xxxd3241xxx  resulted in an average ic50 and
sd of 1.0 ± 0.6 nm (table 1). this ic50 value also favorably compared with the reported invitrogen tr-fret binding assay ic50 of 4.2 nm for  xxxd3241xxx . using a different
bead-based competition binding assay for  xxxg1364xxx , kd values for these same compounds were published as part of a
large kinase profiling panel.30 this published binding data
gave the same rank order as we obtained, and our ic50 values differed from these published kd values by 2.4-fold to
6-fold (table 1). using our atpase assay, the average hill

slopes for this panel of inhibitors ranged from 0.93 to 1.1
(see table 1), which was indicative of a single enzyme species being measured. furthermore, at high concentrations,
all compounds were able to completely inhibit the enzyme
activity (fig. 2c). the compounds in this set were tested
for assay interference by adding compound after completion of the  xxxg1364xxx  enzyme reaction. none of these compounds demonstrated inhibition of the assay format (data
not shown). thus, this panel of structurally diverse and varied potency inhibitors confirmed enzymatic purity of the
atpase activity assay (i.e., a single enzyme species was
generating signal). in addition, the comparable ic50 data

figure 3. validation of the high-throughput  xxxg1364xxx  activity
assay. the intrinsic atpase activity assay was performed using a
low-volume 384-well plate format with a total enzyme reaction
volume of 5 µl. ic50 variability experiments were performed with
the semiautomated high-throughput screening activity assay using
two control inhibitors. ic50 determinations for sunitinib () and
 xxxd1815xxx  () resulted in average ic50 values (nm) ±sd of 963 ±
178 and 1656 ± 319, respectively. data are representative of three
independent experiments.

validation of a miniaturized semiautomated
high-throughput  xxxg1364xxx  activity assay
we converted this  xxxg1364xxx  activity assay into a less expensive semiautomated high-throughput assay by reducing
volume size from 25 to 5 µl and using pin tools to deliver
compound. we assessed assay variability by setting up
whole 384-well plates of maximum and minimum signal
wells by including or excluding enzyme, respectively, and
using dmso instead of compound (suppl. fig.  xxxd3227xxx ). “no
enzyme” signal mimics the signal at high concentration of
inhibitor in this assay (see fig. 2c). the z′ factors calculated from these duplicate hts validation experiments
were 0.68 and 0.77. we tested the validity of the hts version of the assay to reproducibly and accurately determine
compound potency values by performing ic50 determina-

tions with the control inhibitors sunitinib and  xxxd1815xxx 
(fig. 3). this hts version of the  xxxg1364xxx  atpase assay
generated ic50 values and sds of 963 ± 178 nm and 1656
± 319 nm for sunitinib and  xxxd1815xxx , respectively. these
ic50 values are within threefold of the values determined in
the manual assay (see table 1) and acceptable reproducibility with %cvs of <20%. as a final validation step, the
small prestwick collection of predominately food and
drug administration (fda)–approved drugs was screened
using the semiautomated hts version of the  xxxg1364xxx 
atpase assay (suppl. fig. s1b). the z′ factors for this
screen ranged from 0.61 to 0.78, with an average of 0.71.
no actives (≥50% inhibition) were obtained.

screening for  xxxg1364xxx  inhibitors using the
intrinsic atpase activity assay
a kinase-focused library consisting of 4727 compounds
was screened to identify novel  xxxg1364xxx  inhibitors (suppl.
fig. s1c). the z′ factors for this screen ranged from 0.53
to 0.86, with an average of 0.72. only two actives (≥50%
inhibition) were obtained. to identify other control inhibitors of  xxxg1364xxx  kinase activity, we screened a small collection of 13 kinase inhibitors, 11 of which are fda-approved
drugs and two in clinical trials. sunitinib was employed as
an internal control. these compounds were screened at 1
µm concentration in the  xxxg1364xxx  intrinsic atpase assay,
and three hits (≥50% inhibition) were obtained (fig. 4a).
the hits were  xxxd2855xxx ,  xxxd1761xxx , and  xxxd359xxx .

figure 4.  xxxg1364xxx  inhibitory activity of a panel of known kinase inhibitors and ic50 determination for screening hits. (a) a panel
of marketed and clinical trial kinase inhibitors was screened at 1 µm compound concentration using the  xxxg1364xxx  activity assay. the
compounds were screened in duplicate wells in three independent experiments, and the normalized data from all experiments were
aggregated by averaging percentage inhibition values obtained from all experiments and plotting them as shown. error bars represent
standard deviations of the three experiments. (b) concentration-response data for the hit compound from the large kinase-focused
library screen and a structural analog were normalized to controls with and without  xxxg1364xxx  and plotted as percentage specific activity.
one hit (compound 1, ) confirmed activity, with an average ic50 of 299 ± 71 nm and a close structural analog (compound 2, ) resulting
in an ic50 of >30 µm. ic50 data are representative of at least three independent experiments. (c) the compounds resulting in ≥50%

activity assay. with regard to the large kinase-focused
library screen, only one of the two actives repeated activity
in ic50 confirmation using the intrinsic atpase assay; this
hit compound was referred to as compound 1. compound 1
generated an ic50 of 299 ± 71 nm in this assay (fig. 4b;
table 2). a close analog of this compound (compound 2)
was also tested and found to be inactive (>30 µm ic50) and
thus served as a specificity control (fig. 4b; table 2).
from the screening of 13 known kinase inhibitors,  xxxd2855xxx ,  xxxd1761xxx , and  xxxd359xxx  confirmed activity with
ic50 values (±sd) in the atpase assay of 698 ± 163, 75 ±
35, and 59 ± 34 nm, respectively (fig. 4c; table 2).
we employed a tr-fret  xxxg1364xxx  binding assay as an
orthogonal secondary assay to further validate the intrinsic
atpase activity assay and to confirm atpase assay screening hits. this binding assay measures the binding of compound to the atp pocket of  xxxg1364xxx . the  xxxg1364xxx  binding
assay was optimized as indicated by the reagent manufacturer’s instructions (invitrogen lanthascreen eu kinase
binding assay) using the same source of  xxxg1364xxx  enzyme
and assay buffer. concentration-response data for sunitinib
were generated using the  xxxg1364xxx  binding assay (table 2).
the average ic50 value and sd in the binding assay was 143
± 6 nm with an average hill slope of 0.89 ± 0.04. therefore,
the ic50 values for sunitinib in the atpase and binding
assay differed by only 2.4-fold, and our binding data were
very close to the manufacturer’s published ic50 value (120
nm; table 1). compound 1 was tested in the  xxxg1364xxx  binding assay, resulting in an average ic50 value of 355 ± 134
nm, in close agreement with the 299 nm ic50 obtained in
the atpase assay (table 2). the inactive control compound
2 was also inactive (>30 µm ic50) in the binding assay.
thus, compound 1 represents a novel inhibitor of  xxxg1364xxx .
 xxxd2855xxx ,  xxxd1761xxx , and  xxxd359xxx  were also tested in the
 xxxg1364xxx  binding assay, resulting in ic50 values (±sd) of
1145 ± 211, 24 ± 7, and 64 ± 17 nm, respectively (table 2).

journal of biomolecular screening 18(4)

the hill slopes for these compounds in both binding and
atpase assays were close to expected for single-site binding,
ranging from 0.93 to 1.3 (see table 2). none of the compounds in figure 4, table 1, or table 2 demonstrated any
significant assay interference in either the atpase or binding
assay format (data not shown). thus, the  xxxg1364xxx  binding
assay data confirmed the  xxxg1364xxx  inhibitory activity of these
compounds discovered with the  xxxg1364xxx  intrinsic atpase
assay. furthermore, this panel of five diverse inhibitors
(table 2) demonstrated ≤threefold difference in ic50 values
when comparing the atpase and binding assay data.
to further validate the screening hits and the atpase
assay, we developed a transphosphorylation assay in which
kinase-inactive mutant mkk6 was used as a substrate in
 xxxg1364xxx  enzyme reactions. stopped reaction mixtures were
transferred to membranes using a slot blot protocol, and
phosphorylation of mkk6 was m2i32t21 (tpase am>)92 7 229.5ry act

discussion
we sought to develop a high-throughput activity assay for
 xxxg1364xxx . unlike many kinases,  xxxg1364xxx  and many other
members of the mapk family do not effectively use small
synthetic peptides as substrates. thus, large protein substrates are typically used to measure  xxxg1364xxx  activity.
however, for hts, this would require large amounts of
protein substrate. in developing a biochemical activity
assay for  xxxg1364xxx , we discovered that purified  xxxg1364xxx 
had intrinsic atpase activity. this atpase activity was
discovered using a universal chemiluminescent adp detection kit. although convenient, this type of detection assay
requires careful validation to ensure that the observed activity derives from the target kinase (enzyme identity) and no
other kinases or atpases (enzymatic purity). trace amounts
of contaminating atpases or other kinases in the  xxxg1364xxx 
preparation could also cause the observed atpase activity.
multiple independent methods and data were used to verify
that the observed atpase activity derived from  xxxg1364xxx . first,
the identity of the commercially obtained enzyme solution was
confirmed to be human  xxxg1364xxx  by ms, and no other proteins
were identified in the solution. second, we compared three different sources of recombinant baculovirus-expressed and purified  xxxg1364xxx . all three demonstrated atpase activity in the
absence of added substrate, and even the specific activity was
similar among the  xxxg1364xxx  sources. unlike the other two vendors’ constructs, which were full-length proteins, one of the
vendor’s  xxxg1364xxx  consisted of only the kinase domain of
 xxxg1364xxx  yet still maintained atpase activity. furthermore, the
ic50 value determination for the control kinase inhibitor sunitinib using all three sources of  xxxg1364xxx  resulted in ic50 values
within twofold of each other, suggestive of measuring the
same activity. third, inhibitor-based studies were performed
using a panel of four inhibitors that had been tested in the
 xxxg1364xxx  binding assay reported by invitrogen. ic50 values
measured using the atpase assay were comparable (within
two- to fourfold) to invitrogen’s  xxxg1364xxx  binding assay data.
in addition, our data were also consistent with published potencies using a bead-based competition binding assay used for
kinome profiling.30

kinase intrinsic atpase activity has been previously
observed.25
we have developed and optimized a high-throughput activity assay for  xxxg1364xxx  based on the discovery that  xxxg1364xxx  has
intrinsic atpase activity. this activity assay for  xxxg1364xxx  was
validated for enzyme identity and enzymatic purity by multiple
methods to demonstrate that genuine  xxxg1364xxx  activity was
being measured and no other contaminating activities contribute to the signal. furthermore, a miniaturized version of the
assay was validated for hts and compound libraries screened.
 xxxg1364xxx  inhibitors were identified that may be useful as
research tools or lead to potent and selective  xxxg1364xxx 
inhibitors.
