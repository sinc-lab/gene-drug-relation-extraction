methods
adult subjects undergoing open abdominal surgery (n = 911) randomly
received oral  xxxd134xxx  6 or 12 mg, or placebo, 2 h before, and twice
daily following surgery. opioids were administered as intravenous
patient-controlled analgesia (pca) or bolus injection. time to recovery
of gi function was assessed principally using composite endpoints in
subjects undergoing bowel resection (n = 738).

results
a nonsignificant reduction in mean time to tolerate solid food and
either first flatus or bowel movement (primary endpoint) was observed
for both  xxxd134xxx  6 and 12 mg; 8.5 h (95% ci: 0.9, 16.0) and 4.8 h
(95% ci: )3.2, 12.8), respectively. however, an exploratory post hoc
analysis showed that  xxxd134xxx  was more effective in the pca
(n = 317) group than in the non-pca (n = 318) group.  xxxd134xxx  was
well tolerated and did not reverse analgesia.

background
post-operative ileus (poi) affects most patients undergoing abdominal
surgery.
aim
to evaluate the effect of  xxxd134xxx , a peripherally acting mu-opioid
receptor antagonist, on poi by negating the impact of opioids on gastrointestinal (gi) motility without affecting analgesia in patients outside
north america.

conclusion
although the significant clinical effect of  xxxd134xxx  on reducing poi
observed in previous trials was not reproduced, this trial suggests
potential benefit in bowel resection patients who received pca.

introduction
post-operative ileus (poi) is defined as a transient
impairment of gastrointestinal (gi) motility that results
in the failure of ordered peristalsis of intestinal contents. it affects almost all patients undergoing abdominal surgery and often manifests following other
surgeries in the vicinity of the abdomen.1–5 the signs
and symptoms of poi include abdominal distension
and bloating, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping
and pain, absence of bowel sounds, an inability to tolerate solid food, and delayed passage of, or inability
to pass, flatus or stools.2–4, 6, 7 thus, poi causes
increased morbidity7 and reduces patients’ quality of
life.8
the pathophysiology of poi is multifactorial involving a combination of pathways and mechanisms.
these include disruption of normal hormonal, neural
and local factor signalling, which lead to abnormal
electrophysiology and motility of the gi tract, and are
believed to result primarily from surgical trauma ⁄
bowel manipulation and the post-operative administration of opioid analgesia.4, 6, 9–11 although opioids
are used widely to control post-operative pain, they
contribute to the duration and severity of poi by
affecting the migrating motor complex, causing nonpropulsive segmental contractions of the small and
large intestines, inhibiting intestinal ion and fluid
secretion, and increasing transit time.7, 12–14
historically, poi has been perceived by many
healthcare professionals as a normal and expected
consequence of abdominal surgery, for which specific
medical treatment is unnecessary.4, 6 however, there is
growing recognition that poi imposes a substantial
burden on patients and healthcare resources, and that
effective management is required to reduce the impact
and associated costs of this condition.
 xxxd134xxx  is a novel, investigational orally administered, peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor (pamor) antagonist that has the potential to reduce the
duration of poi without affecting analgesia.15, 16 in
phase iii clinical studies in subjects undergoing
abdominal surgery,  xxxd134xxx  accelerated the time to
gi recovery and decreased the length of hospital stay,
without affecting centrally mediated opioid analgesia.17–20 these phase iii studies of  xxxd134xxx  in poi
were conducted in centres in the us and canada. this
study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of
 xxxd134xxx  6 and 12 mg twice daily (b.d.) vs. placebo
in reducing the time to post-operative recovery of gi

outside north america.

methods
study design and participants
this was a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-group, phase iii clinical study
(sb-767905 ⁄ 001) of  xxxd134xxx  vs. placebo in hospitalized subjects undergoing major abdominal surgery
[either elective partial small ⁄ large bowel resection (br)
with primary anastomosis or radical total abdominal
hysterectomy (rtah)]. following a protocol amendment, the subject population was revised to include
only subjects undergoing elective partial small ⁄ large
br with primary anastomosis (with no further recruitment of rtah subjects) as greater benefit had been
demonstrated in br subjects after release of data from
the us studies.17, 18, 20 the study was conducted at 70
hospitals in 11 countries, predominantly within the
european union (austria, belgium, france, germany,
greece, poland, portugal, spain, sweden, uk and new
zealand). the study was conducted according to the
principles of good clinical practice and the declaration of helsinki (1996 version). the study protocol and
amendments were approved at each hospital by independent ethics committees, institutional review boards
and regulatory authorities. all subjects gave written
informed consent before participating in the study.
subjects were eligible to be included in the study if
they were: aged ‡18 years, scheduled for elective partial small or large br with primary anastomosis to be
performed by open laparotomy, scheduled to receive
opioids for intraoperative analgesia and post-operative
pain management, and scheduled to have the nasogastric tube removed no later than the morning following
surgery. subjects were excluded from the study if they
were scheduled to have laparoscopic surgery, a total
colectomy, colostomy or ileostomy or a reversal of a
stoma, if they had a complete bowel obstruction, or if
they were scheduled to receive other treatments or
techniques aimed at reducing ileus (such as epidural
anaesthetic techniques, epidural opioids, non-opioid
epidural anaesthesia, laxatives to stimulate the gut
after surgery, or prophylactic use of antiemetics or
low-dose naloxone). subjects were also excluded if
they had an american society of anesthesiologists
(asa) physical status score of iv or v and were taking or had recently taken opioid analgesics, defined as

314 m . w . b ü c h l e r et al.

receiving a course of opioid analgesics for ‡7 days
before surgery. subjects with a clinically significant
cardiac arrhythmia or a history of alcohol and ⁄ or substance abuse were not permitted to participate in the
study. females who were pregnant, lactating or of
child-bearing potential and not using adequate contraception were also excluded.

assessments
demographic and baseline assessments.

demographic and baseline assessments included: age, gender, race, height, weight, physical examination,
12-lead ecg, past and current medical conditions and
an assessment against the asa physical status score.

primary and secondary endpoints. the primary study

following the screening visit prior to the day of surgery, eligible subjects were randomized 1:1:1 (using
appropriate centralized computer software) stratified
by centres to receive either  xxxd134xxx  (6 or 12 mg) or
matched placebo orally 2 h prior to surgery and then
twice daily from the beginning of post-operative day
(pod) 1 until hospital discharge, or for a maximum of
7 days of post-operative treatment. the total clinical
study duration from signing the informed consent
until the last clinical assessment on the day of discharge or day 14 for those still hospitalized was a
maximum of 21 days. a follow-up review was conducted approximately 6 weeks postsurgery. the study
design is summarized in figure 1.
subjects were encouraged to ambulate ‘as much as
can be tolerated’ from day 1 onwards and feeding was
advanced as tolerated by the subject. all concomitant
medications taken during the study were recorded. use
of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) and
other non-opioid analgesics was allowed, unless
administered via epidural. post-operative pain management with opioids was via either intravenous (i.v.)
patient-controlled analgesia (pca) or ward staffadministered i.v. or intramuscular bolus injection.
importantly, this differed from the studies conducted
in north america, where virtually all subjects received
i.v. pca for post-operative opioid pain management
and the use of some nsaids (such as ketorolac or
cox-2 inhibitors) was restricted, otherwise the participating hospitals could implement their usual pain
management protocols.

endpoint was the time to recovery of gi function
(gi3). a subject was considered to have met the primary endpoint when (s)he had first tolerated food
(recovery of upper gi function) and either passed flatus or experienced a bowel movement for the first
time (recovery of lower gi function). tolerance of food
was defined as the first time the subject was able to
eat solid food (any food that required chewing) without vomiting or experiencing significant nausea within
4 h following the meal, or without having to revert to
enteral fluids only. the passage of flatus was determined by questioning the subject; the passage of a
bowel movement was determined by reference to nursing records or by the clinical judgement of the investigator or designee following questioning the subject.
secondary endpoints included time to first tolerance
of solid food and first bowel movement, whichever of
these occurred last (gi2): time until ready for hospital
discharge, based solely upon investigator-judged
recovery of gi function; time until ready for hospital
discharge, based on investigator-judged medical fitness
of the subject as a whole; time to authorization of
hospital discharge by the investigator; average daily
post-operative opioid consumption; and total pre- and
intraoperative opioid dosage. it is important to note
that time to first flatus is likely to be a less objective
and unreliable endpoint than time to first bm because
a subject must be conscious and willing to report it.21
therefore, the gi2 endpoint may provide a more
objective assessment of upper and lower gi recovery
than gi3 which had been used as a primary endpoint

the primary and secondary endpoints were assessed
twice daily (morning and evening) from pod 1 until
hospital discharge or for a maximum of 14 pods. the
usual routine (nonprotocol specified) post-operative
assessments were not recorded on the case report
forms.

safety and tolerability assessments.

safety was
assessed by monitoring the occurrence and severity of
unexpected adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluations (haematology, serum chemistry with liver function tests and dipstick urinalysis), ecg and vital signs.
adverse events and vital signs were monitored at
screening, pre- and postsurgery, and on all pods until
hospital discharge. adverse events were also monitored at clinical follow-up (5–7 days after last dose of
study medication). laboratory assessments were performed at the screening visit and at hospital discharge.
data were collected for specified surgery-related
adverse events (i.e. nausea and vomiting, post-operative pain, flatulence and constipation) only if these
became more severe or occurred with a higher frequency than expected for the subject’s condition.
subjects who did not complete the course of study
medication were considered to have prematurely withdrawn from investigational treatment, but remained
under follow-up according to the study protocol unless
the subject withdrew their consent. for all subjects
who withdrew prematurely, efforts were made to perform a physical examination, 12-lead ecg, record
concomitant medication use and opioid use, assess
adverse events, obtain blood and urine samples for
laboratory evaluations and contact the subject for
clinical follow-up. study medication was discontinued
if the nasogastric tube had to remain in place beyond
the morning of pod 1 or had to be reinserted. subjects
were withdrawn from the study altogether, if they
received the preoperative dose of study medication less
than 1 h or more than 4 h before the start of surgery.

other assessments. other assessments included postoperative pain scores, which subjects rated twice daily
using a visual analogue scale (vas) from 0 mm (no
pain) to 100 mm (worst pain imaginable). daily opioid
consumption was recorded, including the total number
of tablets or capsules taken if the subject progressed to
oral opioids in hospital, and total opioid consumption
ª 2008 the authors, aliment pharmacol ther 28, 312–325
journal compilation ª 2008 blackwell publishing ltd

was calculated. post-operative total daily opioid consumption was calculated in 24-h periods from the end
of surgery, defined as the time of placement of the last
suture or staple.

statistical analysis
the original sample size calculation for this study was
based on a mixed population (rtah and br) which
resulted in an estimate of 342 evaluable subjects
required to detect a 20% improvement in recovery of
gi function by 84 h postsurgery with 90% power.
combined results from three north american studies17, 18, 20 indicated a treatment benefit of  xxxd134xxx 
against placebo represented by a hazard ratio (hr) of
1.33 in br subjects. on this basis, in this study, it was
estimated that a sample size of 240 br subjects in
each treatment group would be required to detect a
treatment difference reflecting a hr of 1.33 with 80%
power and an overall two-sided significance level of
5%. assuming 10% of randomized subjects would not
be eligible for the modified intent-to-treat (mitt)
analysis (see below), a total of 801 br subjects (267 in
each treatment group) were required to be randomized
and the protocol was amended.
the primary analyses for all efficacy endpoints were
conducted on the br subject group [br(mitt)], which
consisted of all randomized subjects who received at
least one dose of study medication, who underwent
protocol-defined br and had at least one postsurgery
gi efficacy assessment. safety analyses were performed on the all(safety) (subjects who underwent br
or rtah) population and the br(safety) population;
subjects in the safety populations received at least one
dose of study medication and had at least one postbaseline safety assessment.
the cox-proportional hazards model unadjusted for
covariates was used to analyse the effects of treatment
on the time to event endpoints. comparisons between
the  xxxd134xxx  and placebo groups are expressed as
hrs with 95% confidence intervals (cis) and p-values
(calculated using the wald chi-squared test). significance conclusions were based on hochberg’s step-up
method for controlling the overall type i error (a) to
be £5%.23 that is, for multiple comparisons, a p-value
of £0.025 was required if the other treatment group’s
p-value was >0.05. both comparisons are considered
statistically significant, if both p-values are £0.05. in
addition, the mean time to recovery of gi function
was estimated using a kaplan–meier (k–m) survival

316 m . w . b ü c h l e r et al.

curve, with mean differences and 95% cis between the
 xxxd134xxx  and placebo groups calculated from the
area under the k–m survival curve for each group.
subjects were assigned a censored time for an event if
they discontinued prior to recovery of gi function or
completed the study without recovery of gi function.
imputation was used for partially missing dates or
times to events. analysis of variance was used to analyse the treatment effect on pain vas score and daily
post-operative opioid consumption.
all statistical analyses were performed using statistical analysis software (sas) version 8.2 on the uniplexed information and computing system (unix)
platform.

post hoc analysis
despite the similarities in the study design between
this study and the north american studies in terms of
 xxxd134xxx  dosing and study endpoints enabling data
comparisons between studies, there was a key difference in post-operative pain management (route of opioid administration and use of non-opioid analgesics).
all subjects in the north american studies were scheduled to receive opioids via pca, but in the current
international study, subjects could receive post-operative opioids via either pca or ward staff-administered
parenteral bolus. recognition that this could impact
the interpretation of the study results prompted a post
hoc analysis to be conducted on the br(mitt) population, which stratified data by whether opioids were
administered via pca or not. as with the analysis in
the overall study population, survival curves and mean
time to events were estimated from the k–m product
limit method. the results of these analyses can only be
considered hypotheses generating as they were not
preplanned.

results
subjects
a total of 911 subjects were enrolled in the study and
randomized to treatment: 302 to  xxxd134xxx  6 mg, 304
to  xxxd134xxx  12 mg and 305 to placebo. following
the amendment the br subjects (741) formed the population of interest and the main analysis. three subjects were excluded from any analyses: one subject
allocated to  xxxd134xxx  6 mg and one to  xxxd134xxx 
12 mg did not receive any study medication and a

further subject allocated to  xxxd134xxx  12 mg had no
post-baseline assessments. of the majority of the
remaining 738 br subjects who formed the br(safety)
population 705 had at least one postsurgery efficacy
assessment and comprised the br(mitt) population.
the reasons that 170 subjects were excluded from the
br randomization population were that they underwent rtah (106), required surgery other than that
specified in the protocol (20) or did not undergo surgery at all because of medical or other factors (44).
the analysis populations for the primary and post hoc
analyses are summarized in table 1.
of the 738 subjects in the br(safety) population,
565 (77%) completed treatment and 582 (79%) completed the study. protocol violation, adverse events
and consent withdrawal were the most common reasons for both study withdrawal and treatment discontinuation with re-insertion of a nasogastric tube also
leading to discontinuation of the study medication for
a number of subjects. the disposition of subjects in
each of the treatment groups is summarized in

the demographic and baseline characteristics of the
br(safety) population were comparable for subjects in
all three treatment groups (table 2). the anatomical
site of the varietal surgical procedures, which might
impact the degree of bowel manipulation, was categorized (small bowel, large bowel – left, right, transverse,
sigmoid, others); no differences in the distribution of
these procedures between the treatment groups were
observed. the most common reason for br surgery
was malignancy. in the post hoc analysis, the demographic characteristics were similar in subjects who
received post-operative opioids via pca and those
who did not. in the br(safety) population, the most
common concomitant opioid medications were: fentanyl (483 subjects, 65%), morphine (335 subjects, 45%),
pethidine (188 subjects, 26%), piritramide (46 subjects,
ª 2008 the authors, aliment pharmacol ther 28, 312–325

18%) and tramadol (105 subjects, 15%). subject compliance with study medication was high across all
treatment groups, with a mean of 94% for the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg or placebo group and 95% for the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg group [br(safety) population]. the mean
duration of treatment and mean number of doses of
randomised medication were similar in subjects across
the three treatment groups (6.5 days and 11.4 doses
for the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg group; 6.5 days and 11.6
doses for the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg group; 6.4 days and

secondary endpoints. the mean time to the first tolerance of solid food and first bowel movement (gi2)
for the total br(mitt) population was reduced by  xxxd134xxx  6 mg (reduction of 14.3 h, p < 0.001 unadjusted for multiple endpoints) and 12 mg (reduction of
10.7 h, p = 0.008 unadjusted), compared with placebo.
the effects of treatment on other secondary endpoints are summarized in table 4, and none was
statistically significant.

post hoc analysis: opioid consumption. the data on
pre-, intra- and post-operative total opioid consumption for the br(mitt) population from the post hoc
analysis are summarized in table 5. there were no differences between the  xxxd134xxx  and placebo groups in
the total opioid consumption in the pre-, intra- and
post-operative periods.
a majority of opioid consumption took place in the
first 48-h postsurgery, corresponding to the period of
most intense surgical pain. during this period, vas
pain scores did not differ between the  xxxd134xxx  and
placebo groups. in the overall population, only 45% of
subjects used post-operative pca opioids. non-opioid
analgesic use in the first 48 h after surgery was 69%.
in general, opioid consumption decreased substantially
in each treatment group during the first few postsurgery days and by postsurgery day 3, median postoperative opioid consumption had fallen to zero in all

treatment groups. although opioid consumption did
not differ by treatment group at any time during the
study, subjects in the pca subgroup received approximately twice the quantity of opioids in the 48 h after
surgery compared with those received by non-pca
subjects (table 5). however, the analyses of efficacy
by quartiles or deciles of opioid consumption showed
no evidence of an effect of opioid dosage on efficacy
(data not shown) and the vas pain scores did not differ between the pca and non-pca subgroups (data

after surgery was 72% in the pca and 70% in the
non-pca subgroups.

post hoc analysis: recovery of gi function in the pca
and non-pca subgroups. the differences in postoperative opioid analgesia between the pca and nonpca subgroups appeared to have an impact on the

6- and 12-mg groups, and 25 [10%] in the placebo
group]. the most commonly reported teaes (reported
by 5% or more subjects in any treatment group) were
nausea, vomiting and pyrexia (table 7). nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and hypertension were the most common drug-related teaes, and nausea and vomiting
were the only aes reported by more than two subjects
in any group that led to premature discontinuation of
study drug in the br(safety) population.
serious adverse events were reported by 32 (13%)
subjects in the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg group, 38 (15%) subjects in the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg group and 28 (12%)
subjects in the placebo group. the most common serious adverse events were post-operative infection [4
(2%), 3 (1%), 1 (<1%)], anastomotic leak [3 (1%), 2
(<1%), 2 (<1%)], wound dehiscence [2 (<1%), 3 (1%), 2
(<1%)] and abdominal pain [0, 4 (2%), 0] for the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg,  xxxd134xxx  12-mg and placebo groups,
respectively. the serious adverse events reported in the
rtah group were not different in nature or frequency:
two (6%) in the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg group and five (39%)
in the placebo group with no specific event occurring
in more than one subject. no serious adverse events
were reported in the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg rtah group. a
total of seven subjects died during the study overall,
six (0.8%) undergoing br (placebo – three: peritonitis,
upper gi haemorrhage and one death for which no
cause was established;  xxxd134xxx  6 mg – one: multiorgan failure; and  xxxd134xxx  12 mg – two: sudden
death and cerebrovascular accident); none of the
deaths were considered to be study drug-related.
the percentages of subjects in the br(safety) population with abnormal laboratory or vital sign values were
low, and were comparable across the three treatment
groups. subjects with 12-lead ecg findings considered
that changed from normal or abnormal but not of clinical significance at baseline to clinically significantly

abnormal at the day 14 assessment or at discharge if
sooner were few in each treatment group: five (2%) in
the placebo group, one (<1%) in the  xxxd134xxx  6-mg
group and two (1%) in the  xxxd134xxx  12-mg group.
qtc corrected for heart rate by the fredericia formula24
was assessed in a subgroup of subjects (approximately
50 subjects ⁄ group) at baseline and at days 3 and 7 postsurgery. two subjects, one in each of the  xxxd134xxx  6and 12-mg groups had post-baseline qt prolongations
which were not considered serious and resolved. both
of these subjects had confounding factors contributing
to the qt prolongation and did not appear to indicate a
relationship with  xxxd134xxx  treatment.

post hoc analysis: safety in the pca and non-pca
subgroups. there was no apparent difference between
the pca and non-pca subgroups, in terms of the
number of serious adverse events. there was a small
numerical increase in adverse events, including nausea, hypotension and hypoxia, in the pca compared
with the non-pca subgroup. however, there was no
evidence of a clinically significant effect of  xxxd134xxx 
with respect to the incidence of these adverse events.

discussion
this was the first large trial investigating the impact
of  xxxd134xxx  on poi after open abdominal surgery
outside north america. it demonstrated that  xxxd134xxx , administered at doses of 6 and 12 mg b.d., had a
statistically nonsignificant effect on accelerating gi
recovery following br as measured by the primary
composite endpoint gi3 (first tolerance of solid food
and first passing of flatus or bowel movement).
although there is no standardized and widely-used
definition of ‘recovery of gi function’, recovery of the
upper gi tract is generally believed to have occurred
once a patient can chew and swallow solid food without
sequelae. assessment of recovery of lower gi tract function is more controversial and has utilized measures
such as the appearance of bowel sounds and the passage
of flatus which are open to subjective interpretation. a
more objective measure is the passage of stool. the
north american trials,17, 18, 20 on which the design of
the international trial was based, initially selected gi3
as the primary endpoint, which was not always achieved
as the primary analysis. however, careful interrogation
of the placebo data from these trials led to the conclusion that variability was introduced when flatus was

322 m . w . b ü c h l e r et al.

used in the gi3 composite and that this did not add to
the clinical interpretation. gi2 was subsequently
selected as the primary endpoint in a later north american trial as a more clinically relevant measure of gi
recovery.22 in this study, the secondary endpoint gi2,
provided an assessment of gi recovery that was not
dependent on subject reports of flatus, and the mean
times to this endpoint were significantly shorter in the
 xxxd134xxx  groups than in the placebo group.
on the basis of post hoc analysis, it would appear
that the clinical benefits of  xxxd134xxx  may be most
apparent in the subgroup of subjects who received
opioids for post-operative pain management via i.v.
pca for at least the first 48-h postsurgery. in this
cohort of subjects, gi recovery was significantly faster
than placebo as measured either by the primary gi3
endpoint with  xxxd134xxx  6 mg or the secondary gi2
endpoint with both doses of  xxxd134xxx . indeed, the
magnitude of the treatment response in the pca
cohort was similar to that seen in the earlier north
american studies.17, 18, 20 there was no difference in
vas pain scores between the treatment groups in the
first 48 h postsurgery, when pain was most intense,
indicating that  xxxd134xxx  did not reverse opioid analgesia. moreover,  xxxd134xxx  was well tolerated, with a
safety profile comparable to that of placebo.
the opioid and non-opioid analgesic consumption
data in this study are indicative of an overall opioidsparing approach to pain management (in an effort to
bring about an earlier resolution of poi4, 7, 25). in the
first 48-h postsurgery when surgical pain was the most
intense, non-opioid analgesics were used by 69% of
subjects. this is substantially higher than in the earlier
north american studies of  xxxd134xxx  in poi, in which
the consumption of non-opioid analgesics for the same
period was <4%17, 18, 20 (adolor corporation, pers.
comm.).
the results of this study suggest that time to gi
recovery after surgery is affected by the use of opioids
for analgesia. this is consistent with the role of opioids in the patho-aetiology of poi. further exploratory
analyses indicate that subjects receiving post-operative
opioids via pca experienced a longer time to recovery
of gi function than those receiving pain relief via
non-pca methods of opioid administration. however,
there is strong evidence that subjects prefer pca to
alternative forms of post-operative analgesia,26–28 as it
allows them to control both the timing of administration of analgesia and the quantity received. it is noteworthy that in the setting of this clinical trial, the

response of pca-treated subjects to  xxxd134xxx  with
respect to recovery of gi function was consistent with
the results reported in the north american trials where
most of the subjects used pca.
despite growing recognition of poi as a clinical
problem for which appropriate management strategies
should be implemented, there is no agreed definition
of what constitutes poi, and approaches to its minimization and management vary widely from country to
country.20 current approaches to the management of
poi are either preventive or supportive. techniques
employed to prevent poi or limit its impact include
minimally invasive surgery, preoperative preparation,
and decreased use of opioid analgesics. supportive
measures adopted in clinical practice comprise nonpharmacological (e.g. nasogastric intubation, early enteral feeding and early mobilization) as well as
pharmacological (mainly the use of prokinetic agents
or laxatives) strategies. however, none of the current
management approaches, used individually, has consistently been effective in accelerating the resolution
of poi,29–38 while maintaining adequate pain relief.
new effective treatments for poi are needed.
poi is a common cause of prolonged hospitalization
after abdominal surgery and is a significant factor for
hospital readmissions.6, 39, 40 a large cross-sectional
study estimated that poi increased hospital length of
stay (los) by approximately 3 days in subjects undergoing abdominal surgery.40 increased hospital los
caused by poi is associated with increased health care
costs, lost productivity and increased complications.7, 40, 41 accelerating gi recovery and decreasing
hospital los are important objectives for the management of poi.
in this study,  xxxd134xxx  had no benefit on all three
measures of the time to hospital discharge. in contrast,
patients treated with  xxxd134xxx  in the north american
studies17, 18, 20 were able to leave hospital (discharge
order being written) in a significantly shorter time than
those on placebo. we also noted that the time to hospital discharge order written in the placebo group in this
study was some 3–4 days longer than in the placebo
groups of the north american studies, and perhaps the
observed differences in times to hospital discharge may
be explained in terms of differences in social and
financial pressures between europe and north america
with respect to factors that contribute to discharge
decisions. nevertheless, the times to discharge in this
study were shorter than reported in br subjects in a
recent survey of several european countries.42

in conclusion, there was an indication that both  xxxd134xxx  6- and 12-mg doses had an effect on reducing
the duration of poi. an exploratory analysis showed
that this was more marked in subjects who received
pca, a result that was consistent with that shown in
the north american studies of this novel compound.
