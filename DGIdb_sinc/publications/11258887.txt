abstract: polyamine oxidase ( xxxg2178xxx ) carries out the fad-dependent oxidation of the secondary amino
groups of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx , a key reaction in the polyamine catabolism. the active site of  xxxg2178xxx 
consists of a 30 å long u-shaped catalytic tunnel, whose innermost part is located in front of the flavin
ring. to provide insight into the  xxxg2178xxx  substrate specificity and amine oxidation mechanism, we have
investigated the crystal structure of maize  xxxg2178xxx  in the reduced state and in complex with three different
inhibitors, guazatine, 1,8-diaminooctane, and n1-ethyl-n11-[(cycloheptyl)methyl]-4,8-diazaundecane
(chenspm). in the reduced state, the conformation of the isoalloxazine ring and the surrounding residues
is identical to that of the oxidized enzyme. only lys300 moves away from the flavin to compensate for
the change in cofactor protonation occurring upon reduction. the structure of the  xxxg2178xxx ‚inhibitor complexes
reveals an exact match between the inhibitors and the  xxxg2178xxx  catalytic tunnel. inhibitor binding does not
involve any protein conformational change. such lock-and-key binding occurs also in the complex with
chenspm, which forms a covalent adduct with the flavin n5 atom. comparison of the enzyme complexes
hints at an “out-of-register” mechanism of inhibition, in which the inhibitor secondary amino groups are
not properly aligned with respect to the flavin to allow oxidation. except for the glu62-glu170 pair, no
negatively charged residues are involved in the recognition of substrate and inhibitor amino groups, which
is in contrast to other polyamine binding proteins. this feature may be exploited in the design of drugs
specifically targeting  xxxg2178xxx .

the natural polyamines putrescine [nh2(ch2)4nh2], spermidine [nh2(ch2)3nh(ch2)4nh2], and  xxxd3234xxx  [nh2(ch2)3nh(ch2) xxxd831xxx (ch2)3nh2] are ubiquitous in living organisms,
being essential for cell growth and differentiation. their
biological role is being extensively investigated, and the
number of known processes that involve these linear polycationic molecules is continuously increasing. the intracellular concentration of polyamines is finely regulated through
pathways for their synthesis, degradation, and uptake (13).
polyamine oxidase ( xxxg2178xxx )1 is a fad-dependent enzyme
that catalyzes the oxidation of the secondary amino groups

of  xxxd3234xxx , spermidine, and their acetylated derivatives (4,
5). the reaction is part of the ubiquitous pathway for
polyamine degradation. the nature of the products of  xxxg2178xxx 
reactions depends on the enzyme source. animal  xxxg2178xxx 
oxidizes preferentially n1-acetylspermidine and n1-acetylspermine into putrescine and spermidine, respectively, in
addition to 3-acetamidopropionaldehyde (5). in plants and
bacteria,  xxxg2178xxx  converts spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  into 4-aminobutyraldehyde and 3-(aminopropyl)-4-aminobutyraldehyde, respectively, in addition to 1,3-diaminopropane (figure
1) (4, 6).
the interest in polyamine metabolism has increased with
the discovery that some polyamine analogues exhibit antitumoral effects on a number of cell lines (2). various
polyamine analogues display antineoplastic activity in vitro
and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials (7).
therefore, progress in the analysis of the metabolism of these
compounds is a promising route for the design of new drugs
(8). although the precise mechanism of the cytotoxic activity
of polyamines is unknown, it has been noticed that the
accumulation of polyamine analogues leads to dna fragmentation and cell death by apoptosis (9, 10). in particular,
some polyamine analogues, such as n1-ethyl-n11-[(cyclopropyl)methyl]-4,8-diazaundecane2 (chenspm; figure 1),
may induce programmed cell death by increasing the rates

n1-ethyl-n11-[(cycloheptyl)methyl]-4,8-diazaundecane are the acronym

of polyamine catabolism and consequent production of toxic
h2o2 (11). moreover, it has been suggested that  xxxg2178xxx  is
involved in programmed cell death in plants (12).
maize (zea mays l.)  xxxg2178xxx  represents the first  xxxg2178xxx  of
known primary and tertiary structure (13, 14). the crystal
structure of maize  xxxg2178xxx  had been determined by x-ray
diffraction at 1.9 å resolution in the native oxidized state
and in complex with the inhibitor n,n′-bis(2,3-butadienyl) xxxd3043xxx  (mdl72527) (14). the x-ray analysis
revealed that the enzyme structure consists of two domains,
a fad-binding domain showing the typical rossmann fold
topology and a substrate binding domain, comprising a
central beta-sheet flanked by r-helices (figure 2). this overall
folding topology is similar to that of many other flavoenzymes (15). a prominent feature of the  xxxg2178xxx  structure is a
30 å long u-shaped catalytic tunnel located at the interface
between the two domains. the innermost part of the tunnel

is positioned in front of the flavin ring and forms the catalytic
center. the tunnel is lined mainly by aromatic side chains
and carbonyl and carboxylate oxygen atoms, which are able
to form ch‚‚‚o h-bonds with the active site ligands. a ring
of glutamate and aspartate side chains surrounding one of
the two tunnel openings may help to steer the substrate
toward the tunnel interior.
here, we report the crystal structure of complexes of maize
 xxxg2178xxx  and three different inhibitors. the aim of this study is
the characterization of the structural bases of inhibitor and
substrate binding and specificity in  xxxg2178xxx , a prerequisite for
the design of inhibitors targeting enzymes involved in
polyamine metabolism. for these purposes, the symmetrical
competitive inhibitors guazatine3 and 1,8-diaminooctane
3 guazatine is 1,1′-iminodi(octamethylene)diguanidine triacetate
(figure 1).

(figure 1) were chosen, since they exemplify the ability of
 xxxg2178xxx  to bind molecules that greatly differ in size, the chain
of guazatine being 2 times longer than that of 1,8-diaminooctane. moreover, the complex of  xxxg2178xxx  with chenspm
(figure 1) was investigated. chenspm is a member of a
group of several asymmetrically alkylated inhibitors, which
are presently being tested as potential antitumor agents (7,
11). in particular, chenspm is peculiar in that it carries a
bulky cycloheptyl terminal substituent. finally, as a part of
this study, the structure of  xxxg2178xxx  in the reduced state was
determined.
experimental procedures
materials. all chemicals used in crystallization [sodium
chloride, sodium phosphate, ammonium sulfate, sodium
acetate, glycerol, and n,n-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid] were from sigma. guazatine was provided
by rhòne-poulenc (agro, italy). 1,8-diaminooctane and
 xxxd3234xxx  were from sigma. chenspm was a generous gift
of r. a. casero, jr. (university of baltimore, baltimore,
md), and was synthesized as reported previously (16).
crystallization and crystal soaking. maize  xxxg2178xxx  was
purified and crystallized as previously reported (17). briefly,
crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion
method at 20 °c. droplets containing 4 mg of enzyme/ml
in 300 mm nacl and 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph
6.0) were equilibrated against a reservoir solution consisting
of 42-50% saturated ammonium sulfate and 100 mm
sodium acetate (ph 4.6). all  xxxg2178xxx ‚inhibitor complexes were
obtained by soaking at 20 °c for 24 h. experiments were
performed using the following ligands: guazatine, 1,8diaminooctane, chenspm, and  xxxd3234xxx . the soaking
solutions consisted of 5 mm ligand, 55% saturated am-

monium sulfate, and 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (ph 4.6).
the complex with chenspm at ph 7.0 (table 1) was
obtained by using a soaking solution containing 100 mm
n,n-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (bes)
(ph 7.0) rather than sodium acetate (ph 4.6).  xxxg2178xxx  crystals
have the typical bright yellow color of the oxidized flavin.
soaking in 1,8-diaminooctane and guazatine did not result
in any change in the crystal color. conversely, during soaking
with  xxxd3234xxx  and chenspm, the yellow color of the
crystals vanished. this process, indicative of flavin reduction,
occurred in a few minutes in the case of soaking in the
 xxxd3234xxx  containing solution, whereas it took several hours
to be completed in the experiments with chenspm.
data collection, crystallographic refinement, and model
analysis. for data collection, crystals were transferred into
a cryoprotectant solution containing 5 mm ligand, 50%
saturated ammonium sulfate, 25% (v/v) glycerol, and 100
mm sodium acetate buffer (ph 4.6) [100 mm bes (ph 7.0)
for the  xxxg2178xxx ‚chenspm complex at ph 7.0]. all x-ray
diffraction experiments were performed at 100 k using
standard cryocrystallographic techniques (18). data were
measured for reduced  xxxg2178xxx  at beam line bw7b at embl/
desy (hamburg, germany) using a mar-ip345 and for
the  xxxg2178xxx  complexes at beam line id14-eh3 of the european
synchrotron radiation facility (grenoble, france) using a
marccd detector. the data were processed with mosflm
(19) and programs of the ccp4 suite (20). crystals of  xxxg2178xxx ‚
inhibitor complexes had a diffraction power comparable to
that of the native oxidized crystals, allowing measurement
of the diffraction data up to 1.9-2.1 å resolution.
the crystals of  xxxg2178xxx  complexes were isomorphous to those
of the native oxidized enzyme (14) (table 1). they belong
to space group p6522 with three enzyme molecules in the

inhibitor binding in polyamine oxidase

asymmetric unit. atomic coordinates were refined by means
of the least-squares refinement program tnt (21). in all
experiments, the initial model used in refinement was that
of the native unligated structure (14), deposited as entry 1b37
in the protein data bank (22). all measured data were
employed, without applying any low-resolution or sigma cutoff.
throughout refinement, tight ncs restraints were applied
to the three crystallographically independent molecules.
progress of the refinement was monitored by rfree (23), which
was calculated using the same set of reflections used for
the rfree calculation in the refinement of the native structure.
ordered water molecules were automatically added with
the program arp (24). manual model building was carried
out with the program o (25). all the active site ligands
were well defined in both 2fo - fc and fo - fc maps (figure
3). the quality of the stereochemical parameters of the
refined models was evaluated with procheck (26).
data collection and refinement statistics are listed in table
1.

analysis and inspection of the three-dimensional structures
were carried out with o (25) and programs of the uppsala
software factory (27) and of the ccp4 package (20). the
solvent accessible surface was calculated with the program
area (20) using a probe radius of 1.4 å. cutoff distances of
4.0 and of 3.4 å were used for van der waals contacts and
h-bonds, respectively. figures were generated with molscript
(28), bobscript (29), and dino (30).
results
overall structure. the crystal structure of  xxxg2178xxx  in the
reduced state and in complex with the inhibitors chenspm,
1,8-diaminooctane, and guazatine (figure 1 and table 1) has
been investigated. in all cases, the inhibitors are well defined
in the electron density map (figure 3), being bound in the
u-shaped catalytic tunnel that runs across the  xxxg2178xxx  structure
(figure 2). the crystals of maize  xxxg2178xxx  contain three enzyme
molecules in the asymmetric unit (named a, b, and c). as
in the native structure (14), chain c has a slightly lower

orientation is the same as in figure 2.

average b-factor with respect to those of the a and b
monomers (table 1). for this reason, chain c has been
chosen as the reference molecule for model analysis and
structure description. however, in all complexes, the three
crystallographically independent monomers, which were
subjected to tight ncs restraints throughout the refinement,
are virtually identical in both overall structure and geometry
of the active center and substrate binding site (table 1).
neither cofactor reduction nor inhibitor binding causes
significant conformational changes compared to native  xxxg2178xxx .
the rmsd between equivalent cr atoms of the native
unligated enzyme and the complexes with chenspm at ph
4.6, chenspm at ph 7.0, 1,8-diaminooctane, and guazatine
are 0.13, 0.17, 0.10, and 0.14 å, respectively. likewise, the
rmsd deviation between the native oxidized enzyme and the
reduced protein is 0.27 å. given the absence of any change
in the overall structure, the description of the  xxxg2178xxx ‚inhibitor
complexes will mainly focus on the catalytic center and
substrate binding site.
reduced  xxxg2178xxx . soaking of crystals in a solution containing
the substrate  xxxd3234xxx  led to a change in the color of the
crystals from bright yellow, typical of the oxidized enzyme,
to a pale color. this change occurred in a few minutes and
suggested that the crystalline enzyme reacted with the
substrate, thereby becoming reduced. the soaking experiment
was carried out in air-saturated solutions, indicating that,
despite the presence of oxygen, the large excess of substrate
(5 mm) was able to keep crystalline  xxxg2178xxx  in the reduced
state (see ref 31). consistent with this observation, transfer
of a reduced “colorless” crystal to a substrate free solution
resulted in crystal reoxidation as indicated by the almost
immediate reappearance of the yellow color. a protective
effect against reoxidation brought about by the presence of
substrate in excess has been observed in other flavoenzyme
crystals such as those of  xxxg602xxx  (32, 33).
the electron density of the reduced enzyme does not show
any indication of the presence of active site ligand(s), with
the innermost part of the catalytic tunnel being occupied by
eight ordered water molecules. thus, it appears that the
products generated by  xxxd3234xxx  oxidation (figure 1) are
released from  xxxg2178xxx  after catalysis. the structure of the active
site of the reduced enzyme is identical to that of the native
oxidized  xxxg2178xxx  (14). the heavily bent conformation of the
flavin is left unmodified by reduction, with an angle of 28°

between the dimethylbenzene and pyrimidine rings, very
close to the value of 30° observed in the oxidized enzyme.
the only change observed in the reduced protein affects the
lys300 conformation (figure 4). in native oxidized  xxxg2178xxx ,
the amino group of lys300 is engaged in a h-bond with a
water molecule, which is further h-bonded to the flavin n5
atom. upon reduction, the chi4 torsion angle of lys300 changes
from 69° to -162°, leading to a 1.9 å shift of the n amino
group. in its new position, n interacts with the side chain
of asn59 and the backbone oxygen atoms of glu55 and
gly57. however, despite such a movement of lys300, the
water molecule, which in the oxidized structure is h-bonded
to n5 and lys300, retains its position also in the reduced
enzyme. in particular, this water molecule is within hbonding distance of the flavin n5 atom and another solvent
molecule, not present in the oxidized protein.
upon cofactor reduction, the flavin n5 atom becomes
protonated. lys300 seems to be perfectly positioned to
function as a conformational switch that compensates for
the change in the flavin protonation state. in the oxidized
 xxxg2178xxx , a water molecule acts as a bridge between the
unprotonated n5 atom and the positively charged lys300
side chain. after reduction, lys300 moves away, possibly
allowing a reorientation of this water, which, therefore, is
enabled to function as a h-bond acceptor in the interaction
with the protonated n5 atom of the reduced fad.
 xxxg2178xxx ‚guazatine complex. guazatine inhibits maize  xxxg2178xxx 
with a ki value of 7.5 × 10-9 m at ph 6.5 and 25 °c (34).
among  xxxg2178xxx  inhibitors, guazatine comprises the longest
linear chain, consisting of two octane units that are connected
by a secondary nitrogen atom (n9 in figure 1). such a long
(ch2)8-nh-(ch2)8 chain is further elongated by two terminal
guanidinium groups (figure 1).
guazatine binds to the catalytic tunnel of  xxxg2178xxx  (figure
2), adopting a curved conformation that is made possible
mainly by two kinks along the path of the inhibitor chain.
in particular, c4-c5-c6-c7, c5-c6-c7-c8, n9c10-c11-c12, and c10-c11-c12-c13 torsion angles
(figure 5a) have values of -117°, 127°, -110°, and -83°,
respectively, being the only dihedral angles of the bound
guazatine which do not adopt the anti conformation (angle
of ∼180°). despite the bulkiness of the ligand, the positions
of the atoms lining the active site tunnel in the  xxxg2178xxx ‚
guazatine complex are strikingly identical to those of the

inhibitor binding in polyamine oxidase

tunnel openings. in this orientation, the guanidinium group bound
to the c17 atom (see figure 1 and panel a) is in the upper position.

native oxidized structure. the only movement is a small 0.15
å shift of the carbonyl oxygen of gly438. guazatine

biochemistry, vol. 40, no. 9, 2001 2771
extensively interacts with  xxxg2178xxx  (figure 5a) through van der
waals contacts with aromatic side chains. moreover, the
secondary n9 nitrogen of guazatine is h-bonded to tyr298,
whereas three inhibitor carbon atoms (c6, c8, and c10) are
within h-bonding distance of the carboxylate groups of
glu62 and glu170. the presence of this type of ch‚‚‚o
h-bonds also characterizes the  xxxg2178xxx ‚mdl72527 complex
(14) and, therefore, seems to be a recurrent feature in the
 xxxg2178xxx  inhibitor binding mode, independent of the nature of
the active site ligand.
a remarkable feature revealed by the structure of the  xxxg2178xxx ‚
guazatine complex is the fact that the long inhibitor chain
completely fills the tunnel (figure 5b). when complexed to
the enzyme, guazatine has a solvent accessible surface area
of only 90 å2, which can be entirely ascribed to the terminal
guanidinium groups located at the tunnel entrances (figure
5b). by contrast, the total surface area of the guazatine
molecule is 720 å2, indicating that formation of the  xxxg2178xxx ‚
inhibitor complex buries about 90% (630 å2) of the guazatine
surface area. in keeping with this observation, the inhibitor
binding causes the expulsion of all eight ordered water
molecules present in the tunnel of the unligated enzyme
structure. thus, the excellent complementarity between the
tunnel and guazatine leads to nearly complete desolvation
of the bound inhibitor.
 xxxg2178xxx ‚1,8-diaminooctane complex. 1,8-diaminooctane inhibits maize  xxxg2178xxx  with a ki of 3.0 × 10-7 m (r. federico,
unpublished). the length of 1,8-diaminooctane is approximately half of that of guazatine (figure 1), being among the
shortest known  xxxg2178xxx  inhibitors. the electron density map
of the  xxxg2178xxx ‚1,8-diaminooctane complex showed a strong and
elongated peak in the central part of the tunnel in all three
crystallographically independent protein molecules. surprisingly, the electron density peak turned out to be too long to
simply account for one 1,8-diaminooctane ligand, its length
being consistent with a chain of about 15 atoms (figure 6).
the electron density could reflect the presence of two
adjacent nonoverlapping inhibitor molecules, one or both of
them having part of their structure in a disordered conformation, not visible in the electron density map. although this
interpretation of the electron density cannot be completely
ruled out, it has been disregarded in view of the following
considerations: (i) refinement of two side-by-side 1,8diaminooctane molecules gave poorer statistics; (ii) as shown
by the guazatine complex, the narrow tunnel seems unlikely
to give the degree of flexibility required to justify the lack
of well-defined electron density for part of one or both of
the two bound inhibitors; and (iii) the electron density peak
is continuous, which is not expected if two adjacent
nonoverlapping inhibitor molecules are bound.
on these bases, the electron density has been instead
modeled as two overlapping 1,8-diaminooctane molecules
(figure 6), whose atoms were refined with an occupancy of
0.5. this value was suggested by refinement of the inhibitor
occupancies (21). this interpretation assumes that 1,8diaminooctane has at least two binding modes that are
mutually exclusive and partly overlapping. in each of the
alternative conformations, the terminal amino groups located
in the innermost part of the tunnel form h-bonds to the
protein, one with tyr298 and the other with glu62. the first
h-bond mimics the interaction of n9 of guazatine with the
tyrosine side chain (figure 5a), whereas the other h-bond

mimics that of the c6 atom of guazatine with the glutamate.
indeed, the two alternative conformations of 1,8-diaminooctane closely resemble that of guazatine (figure 7). thus, the
1,8-diaminooctane complex is consistent with the idea
emerging from the  xxxg2178xxx ‚guazatine structure that the tunnel
provides along its entire path a favorable environment for
binding aliphatic molecules of variable length.
covalent  xxxg2178xxx ‚chenspm complex at ph 4.6. several
asymmetrically alkylated polyamine analogues have shown
cytotoxic effects on cancer cells and are of potential
therapeutic use as antitumor agents (2, 8, 11). we have
investigated  xxxg2178xxx  in complex with one of these compounds,
chenspm, which is characterized by an ethyl and a
cycloheptyl terminal substituent (figure 1). when  xxxg2178xxx 

crystals were soaked in a chenspm-containing solution,
they gradually became colorless. such a crystal bleaching
process required several hours to be completed and suggested
that chenspm very slowly reacted with the oxidized
crystalline protein generating a reduced form of the cofactor.
the electron density map, calculated with diffraction data
measured from a crystal soaked for 24 h in chenspm,
confirmed these observations. the electron density was
compatible with the presence of a covalent adduct between
the c4 atom of chenspm (figure 1) and the flavin n5 atom
(figure 3). the synthesis of this flavin derivative could be
triggered by a slow oxidation of the n3-c4 bond of
chenspm (figure 8). the resulting imino-chenspm
product could then undergo hydrolysis, with release of

inhibitor binding in polyamine oxidase

formation of the  xxxg2178xxx ‚chenspm covalent adduct. the chenspm
atoms are numbered as in figure 1.

aminoethane and formation of a transient complex between
the reduced enzyme and the chenspm-derived aldehyde.
the latter could then react with the reduced flavin, leading
to the formation of the observed covalent adduct. a very
similar mechanism involving a reduced  xxxg2178xxx -aldehyde
intermediate with formation of a covalent flavin derivative
has been shown to exist in the reaction of lactate oxidase
with  xxxd2219xxx  (35), and therefore, it is not unprecedented
in flavoenzymology.
several lines of evidence support the presence of the
proposed covalent adduct. the electron density unambiguously shows that the atom covalently linked to n5 has a
nonplanar configuration. this is fully consistent with the
tetrahedral configuration of the adduct c4 atom carrying a
hydroxyl group (figure 8). moreover, strong electron density
departs from the flavin n5 locus extending across one arm
of the u-shaped catalytic tunnel (the “upper” arm in figures

biochemistry, vol. 40, no. 9, 2001 2773
2 and 5b). the chenspm linear chain going from c4 to
c16 fits very well this elongated density peak (figure 3).
chains a and b lack any residual electron density for the
cycloheptyl moiety. this group falls in a position outside
the tunnel and, therefore, may not be fixed in a defined
conformation. interestingly, in chain c, there is a residual
density, which extends from the c16 position (figure 3) and
might reflect the presence of a partly ordered cycloheptyl
ring. however, this density is too weak and poorly defined
to allow modeling of the chenspm terminal substituent.
in the covalent adduct, the chenspm chain protruding
from the flavin binds in one of the two arms of the u-shaped
tunnel. its position overlaps that of the n9-c17 segment of
guazatine (figures 5a, 5b, and 7). conversely, the other arm
remains occupied by a few ordered solvent molecules. thus,
it could easily provide access of the water molecule involved
in the hydrolysis of imino-chenspm and allow the subsequent release of the aminoethane product (figure 8). in
agreement with the other  xxxg2178xxx ‚inhibitor structures, the
covalent adduct also displays virtually no conformational
changes with respect to the native enzyme. the isoalloxazine
ring is in the usual bent conformation, identical to that of
the native protein (figure 3). moreover, the flavin n5 atom
is within h-bonding distance of a water molecule, which is
additionally h-bonded to the hydroxyl group of the chenspm
c4 atom (figure 3). the only significant change affects
lys300, whose side chain adopts the same conformation
observed in the reduced enzyme (figure 4). this feature,
however, is not surprising, reflecting the reduced state of
the flavin in the  xxxg2178xxx ‚chenspm derivative.
covalent  xxxg2178xxx ‚chenspm complex at ph 7.0. a soaking
experiment using chenspm was carried out in a solution
buffered by 100 mm bes (ph 7.0) instead of sodium acetate
(ph 4.6), which was employed in all other soaking experiments. despite the relatively large ph change,  xxxg2178xxx  crystals
maintained their diffraction power and a 2.0 å data set could
be measured. the resulting electron density map turned out
to be virtually indistinguishable from that calculated for the
 xxxg2178xxx ‚chenspm complex at ph 4.6. indeed, after refinement, the rmsd between the cr atoms of the  xxxg2178xxx ‚
chenspm structures at ph 7.0 and ph 4.6 is 0.08 å for all
three ncs-related molecules. this fact leads to three main
conclusions: (i)  xxxg2178xxx  confirms to have a quite rigid structure;
(ii) the acidic ph used for crystal growth and analysis is
very unlikely to perturb the protein structure with respect to
that adopted by the enzyme at neutral ph, reflecting the
ability of maize  xxxg2178xxx  to retain catalytic activity over a wide
ph range (36); and (iii) formation of the covalent adduct
also occurs at neutral ph.
discussion
lock-and-key inhibitor binding in  xxxg2178xxx . the crystallographic investigation of  xxxg2178xxx ‚inhibitor complexes reveals
a precise complementarity between the catalytic tunnel and
the active site ligands. the conformation of the protein is
unaffected by the inhibitors, whose binding mode appears,
therefore, to be of the lock-and-key type with little or no
induced fit. indeed, in all complexes, water molecules are
totally removed from the tunnel section where the ligand is
positioned, effectively desolvating the  xxxg2178xxx -bound ligand.
these features are well exemplified by the complex with
guazatine (figure 2). except for the guanidinium terminal

2774 biochemistry, vol. 40, no. 9, 2001
groups, all inhibitor atoms become solvent inaccessible with
the burial of more than 600 å2 of surface area. the long
guazatine chain contains 18 dihedral angles (figure 5a),
which, on binding, become fixed in a single conformation.
the entropic cost of such a “conformational freezing” is
compensated by the extensive guazatine-protein interactions,
most of them involving inhibitor aliphatic carbons and
aromatic side chains. thus, the hydrophobic effect due to
the removal of the inhibitor aliphatic moieties from aqueous
solvent seems to provide the main factor in the binary
complex stabilization.
however, the  xxxg2178xxx ‚inhibitor interactions do not simply
involve van der waals contacts but also ch‚‚‚o h-bonds
(figure 5a). therefore, it appears that the interactions with
water molecules that the ligand can establish in solution are
partly replaced in the enzyme‚inhibitor complexes by hbonds with protein oxygen atoms. this phenomenon may
reflect the fine energetic balancing that  xxxg2178xxx  must effect in
substrate binding. the tunnel provides a solvent-protected
hydrophobic environment that is favorable for the aliphatic
segments of the substrates. on the other hand, an entirely
hydrophobic binding site may represent an “overly favorable”
environment, which could form an energetic trap, hampering
catalysis by preventing product(s) release or even formation
of the transition state (37).  xxxg2178xxx  avoids this problem by
interacting with the substrate through a combination of
hydrophobic contacts, which are not possible in solution, and
polar ch‚‚‚o bonds, which are similar to the interactions
possibly made in solution by the substrate carbon atoms with
the surrounding waters.
an “out-of-register” mechanism of  xxxg2178xxx  inhibition. the
physiological substrates of  xxxg2178xxx  bear both primary and
secondary amino groups (figure 1). a remarkable feature
revealed by the crystal structure of  xxxg2178xxx  binary complexes
is that the polycationic nature of the polyamine substrates
does not find a counterpart in an array of negatively charged
residues in the binding site. indeed, the only group inside
the tunnel, which is likely to carry a negative charge, is the
glu62-glu170 pair, whose side chains are within h-bonding
distance from each other (figures 5a and 9). this feature is
related to another important observation emerging from the
comparison of the various  xxxg2178xxx  complexes (figure 7).
superposition of the  xxxg2178xxx -bound inhibitors shows that carbon
and nitrogen atoms can bind at the same location within the
tunnel. in fact, the positions of the n1 and n8 atoms of a
 xxxg2178xxx -bound 1,8-diaminooctane overlap those of c15 and c6
of guazatine, respectively. likewise, n7 of chenspm
(figure 3) occupies the same position of guazatine c13.
apparently, the  xxxg2178xxx  tunnel does not contain subsites, which
are specific for amino groups. rather, either ch2 or nh
atoms, depending on the inhibitor complex, may occupy the
same position.
the fundamental question raised by these observations
concerns the nature of the structural determinants that
discriminate between an actual substrate and an inhibitor of
 xxxg2178xxx . for example, guazatine (figure 1) and mdl72527 (14)
both carry a secondary amino group but, nevertheless, are
not oxidized by the enzyme. inspection of the  xxxg2178xxx ‚inhibitor
complexes shows that the ligand secondary amino groups
and the adjacent carbon atoms are too far from the reactive
n5 locus of the flavin to undergo oxidation. the c8 and
c10 atoms of guazatine linked to the n9 secondary amino

group (figures 1 and 5a) are 4.7 and 6.2 å from n5,
respectively. independent of the exact mechanism of catalysis, these distances are too long to allow flavin-catalyzed
oxidation. thus, it appears that a key factor in achieving
catalysis is the correct alignment of the c-n bond undergoing oxidation with respect to the flavin ring. inhibitors such
as guazatine attain an out-of-register binding mode, which
allows tight binding but not catalysis.
a model for  xxxd3234xxx  binding. to investigate the structural basis of substrate specificity, the substrate  xxxd3234xxx  has
been tentatively modeled in the  xxxg2178xxx  active site (figure 1),
based on the following criteria. (i) guazatine has been used
as an atomic skeleton. this inhibitor is very well defined in
electron density, and apart from the terminal guanidinium
groups, its chain, like  xxxd3234xxx , does not contain double
bonds (figure 1). (ii) the position of the site of oxidative
attack ( xxxd3234xxx  c9 in figure 1) was assumed to be identical
to that found in other flavoenzymes. a comparison among
flavoprotein structures carrying out dehydrogenation reactions has shown that the ch group undergoing oxidation with
concomitant rupture of the c-h bond is located in a
strikingly conserved position in front of the n5 locus of the
flavin (15). the c7 atom of guazatine (figure 5a) is 3.6 å
from n5 with a c7(guazatine)-n5(flavin)-n10(flavin)
angle of 96°, well within the range of values found for the
site of oxidative attack in other flavoenzymes (15). thus,
the  xxxd3234xxx  c9 atom (figure 1) undergoing oxidation in
maize  xxxg2178xxx  was modeled at the same position of guazatine
c7.
the  xxxg2178xxx ‚ xxxd3234xxx  model is shown in figure 9. as
expected, the substrate becomes completely solvent inaccessible when bound to the protein. the substrate amino
groups are all within h-bonding distance of protein side
chains: n1 from glu170, n5 from tyr169, n10 from glu62,
and n14 from tyr439. in this h-bond network, glu62 and
glu170 are crucial in that they bind to primary (n1) and

inhibitor binding in polyamine oxidase
secondary (n10) amino groups of  xxxd3234xxx , respectively. the
glu62-glu170 pair may represent the structural element that
senses the correct spacing between the substrate primary and
secondary amino groups and properly aligns the substrate
within the tunnel to achieve catalysis. however, the role of
these residues in dictating substrate specificity needs to be
tested by site-directed mutagenesis.
the mechanism of flavin-dependent oxidation of amines
has been thoroughly investigated, especially for monoamine
oxidase (see ref 38 and references therein) and sarcosine
oxidase (39). in particular,  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  is considered
the prototype of amine oxidases; its sequence is 20% identical
to that of  xxxg2178xxx  (14), although it acts on primary rather than
secondary amines. three mechanisms have been proposed
for  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  and sarcosine oxidase (38, 39): (i)
a single electron-transfer mechanism involving an intermediate flavin anion/amine cation radical pair, (ii) a polar
nucleophile mechanism occurring via a nucleophilic attack
at flavin  xxxg283xxx  by a deprotonated amine, and (iii) a hydride
transfer mechanism requiring direct transfer of a hydride ion
to flavin n5 from the substrate carbon adjacent to the amino
group. the available structural data for  xxxg2178xxx  do not
discriminate between these hypothetical mechanisms. the
side chain of glu62 and the water molecule h-bonded to
flavin n5 are well positioned to play a role in catalysis, e.g.,
to abstract a proton from the substrate. moreover, in the
proposed model for  xxxd3234xxx  binding, the substrate n10 and
c9 atoms are juxtaposed to flavin  xxxg283xxx  and n5, respectively.
this situation is compatible with any of the three catalytic
mechanisms that have been proposed. in fact, it would make
possible transfer of an electron or of a hydride to the flavin
as predicted by the single-electron transfer and hydride
transfer mechanisms, respectively. however, this substrate
binding mode is compatible also with the formation of the
covalent  xxxg283xxx  adduct postulated by the nucleophile mechanism. interestingly, the orientation with respect to the flavin
of the  xxxd3234xxx  n10-c9 bond undergoing oxidation is
highly similar to that observed in  xxxg602xxx  for
the n-cr unit of the amino acid substrate (40). thus, an
intriguing hypothesis is that the structural features underlying
substrate oxidation among flavin-dependent amino acid
oxidases and amino oxidases may be similar.
conclusions
the narrow catalytic tunnel of  xxxg2178xxx  is highly complementary to inhibitors and substrates. however, except for
the glu62-glu170 pair, in the tunnel there are no other
negatively charged residues that take part in the recognition
of the ligand amino groups. this is in sharp contrast to other
polyamine binding proteins, such as deoxyhypusine synthase
(41) and the polyamine carrier protein potd (42), where the
primary amino groups of spermidine are bound through
interactions with several asp and glu residues. in vivo,  xxxg2178xxx 
is known to act on  xxxd3234xxx , spermidine, n1-acetylspermine,
n1-acetylspermidine, and, in certain organisms, even norspermine (1, 5). the lack of charged groups in the  xxxg2178xxx 
catalytic tunnel may serve the purpose of conferring to the
enzyme a rather broad specificity, allowing the recognition
of ligands with a variable length and number of amino
groups. these differences in the architecture of the substrate
binding sites among proteins acting on polyamines may be

biochemistry, vol. 40, no. 9, 2001 2775
exploited for the design of inhibitors targeting specific
enzymes involved in polyamine metabolism.
