summary
abstract

a77 1726, the  xxxd3316xxx , is an immunomodulator which
inhibits cell proliferation in activated lymphocytes in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. because a77 1726 has a long half-life (≈2 weeks), treatment
with oral  xxxd2450xxx  is initiated with a loading dose of 100mg once daily for 3
days and continued with 20mg once daily.
results of large randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials of up to 24
months’duration have shown that  xxxd2450xxx  is significantly superior to placebo
and at least as effective as  xxxd3255xxx  in improving primary outcome measures,
such as tender joint counts, swollen joint counts and physicians’ and patients’
global assessment, in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. whereas
improvement in all primary outcome measures with  xxxd2450xxx  was similar to
or significantly less than that with methotrexate after 12 months, the efficacy of
both agents was similar after 24 months. the therapeutic effect of  xxxd2450xxx 
appears earlier (at 4 weeks) than that of  xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate, and reduction from baseline values in functional disability was significantly greater with
 xxxd2450xxx  than with  xxxd3255xxx , methotrexate or placebo at end-point.
 xxxd2450xxx  was at least as effective as  xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate in delaying
the rate of radiological progression of disease.
the most common adverse events reported in patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx 
in randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were diarrhoea (27%), respiratory infections (21%), nausea (13%), headache (13%), rash (12%), increased
serum hepatic aminotransferases (10%), dyspepsia (10%) and alopecia (9%).
 xxxd2450xxx  was as well tolerated as  xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate in clinical
trials. monitoring of serum hepatic enzyme levels is recommended in patients
receiving  xxxd2450xxx . the drug is not recommended in female patients who are
or may become pregnant. drug treatment should be discontinued, and hastened
drug elimination procedure should be considered, in male patients wishing to
father a child. 16 potential cases of pancytopenia and 9 cases of serious skin
reactions have been associated with the use of  xxxd2450xxx  in 76 000 patients to
date.
conclusions:  xxxd2450xxx  is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug which
reduces the signs and symptoms of inflammatory arthritis and delays the radiological progression of disease in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.
the drug appears to be as effective and as well tolerated as  xxxd3255xxx  or
methotrexate, and represents a suitable alternative to these agents in adult patients
with active rheumatoid arthritis. benefits with  xxxd2450xxx  are evident within 4
weeks and efficacy is maintained for durations of up to 24 months.

pharmacodynamic
properties

 xxxd2450xxx  is an immunomodulatory prodrug which is rapidly converted to its
active metabolite, a77 1726, possibly in the gut wall, plasma and in the liver.

 xxxd2450xxx : a review

1139

a77 1726 inhibits cell proliferation in activated lymphocytes in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis but its precise mechanism of action is unclear. in vitro data
indicate that the drug inhibits dihydro- xxxd2794xxx  dehydrogenase activity and protein
 xxxg2198xxx  activity in actively dividing cells. additional pharmacodynamic
effects of the drug, such as inhibition of nuclear factor kappab activation and nuclear
factor kappab-dependent reporter gene expression and inhibitory effects on oxygen
radical, immunoglobulin (ig)g and igm production and interleukin (il)-1beta and
il-2 levels, may also contribute to the immunomodulatory effects of a77 1726.
treatment with oral  xxxd2450xxx  5 to 35 mg/kg/day decreased signs and symptoms of arthritis and histological evidence of joint damage in rodent models of
rheumatoid arthritis and  xxxg1055xxx .
the effects of  xxxd2450xxx  are at least additive with other disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (dmards) such as cyclosporin and sirolimus (rapamycin)
in vitro and in vivo.
pharmacokinetic
properties

after oral administration,  xxxd2450xxx  is rapidly metabolised to its active metabolite, a77 1726, possibly in the gut wall, plasma and in the liver. peak plasma
a77 1726 concentrations are reached 6 to 12 hours after oral administration of
 xxxd2450xxx . in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a77 1726 reaches steady-state
plasma concentrations of 18 and 63 mg/l after administration of oral  xxxd2450xxx 
10 and 25 mg/day.
a77 1726 is 99.38% bound to plasma proteins and has an apparent volume of
distribution of 0.13 l/kg. the drug undergoes enterohepatic circulation and biliary recycling may contribute to its long elimination half-life (≈2 weeks). because
of the long elimination half-life, treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  should be initiated
with a loading dose of 100mg once daily for 3 days to hasten attainment of
steady-state plasma concentrations.
48% of the administered dose is excreted in the faeces and 43% in the urine.
the drug was cleared at a rate of 0.031 l/h after intravenous administration and
smokers tend to clear the drug at a faster rate than nonsmokers. age and gender
do not have any consistent effect on the pharmacokinetics of a77 1726. plasma
a77 1726 free fraction concentrations were higher in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis and in patients chronic renal insufficiency than in healthy volunteers.
a77 1726 is not dialysable. the effects of hepatic dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics of a77 1726 are unknown.
oral  xxxd1684xxx  8g 3 times a day for 24 hours or activated charcoal 50g
every 6 hours for 24 hours are reported to rapidly decrease plasma a77 1726
concentrations (by 49 to 65% and 48%, respectively, after 48 hours). coadministration of rifampicin (rifampin) increases peak plasma a77 1726 concentrations
by ≈40%. no pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported after coadministration of  xxxd2450xxx  with triphasic oral contraceptives, methotrexate or cimetidine. since a77 1726 inhibits cytochrome p450 (cyp) 2c9 in vitro, the drug
may have potential for interaction with other drugs which are metabolised by this
enzyme, such as diclofenac, ibuprofen and  xxxd3394xxx .

therapeutic efficacy

once daily oral  xxxd2450xxx  20mg (after a loading dosage of 100mg once daily
for 3 days) was effective in the treatment of adult patients with active rheumatoid
arthritis in large randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials. significant benefit
with  xxxd2450xxx  was evident after 4 weeks’ and the drug had a faster onset of
action than  xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate. improvement with  xxxd2450xxx  in all
primary outcome measures, such as tender joint count, swollen joint count, phy-

sicians’ and patients’ global assessment of disease severity, and in american
college of rheumatology (acr) 20 criteria were similar to those with  xxxd3255xxx  2 g/day after 6 months. however, improvements from baseline in physicians’
and patients’ global assessment and acr 20 responder rates were significantly
better with  xxxd2450xxx  than with  xxxd3255xxx  after 24 months.
the efficacy of  xxxd2450xxx  was broadly similar to that of methotrexate 7.5
to 15 mg/week. improvement in all primary outcome measures with methotrexate
was significantly better than with  xxxd2450xxx  after 12 months’ treatment in 1
trial, but there was no difference between the treatment groups in another trial of
similar duration. change from baseline in tender joint, patient’ global assessment
and the acr 20 responder rate were similar in  xxxd2450xxx - or methotrexatetreated patients after 24 months. furthermore,  xxxd2450xxx  was reported to be
equivalent to methotrexate in an area-under-the-curve analysis of the acr 20
responder rate.
 xxxd2450xxx  reduced functional disability to a significantly greater extent
than  xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate. significantly greater benefit on functional
disability with  xxxd2450xxx  than with  xxxd3255xxx  was evident after 6 months
and was maintained over a period of up to 24 months.  xxxd2450xxx  was significantly better than methotrexate in 5 of the 6 methods used to assess functional
disability and quality of life in another trial of 12 months’ duration.
 xxxd2450xxx  is at least as effective as  xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate in delaying
the rate of radiological progression of disease. radiological progression of disease over 24 months was significantly slower with  xxxd2450xxx  or  xxxd3255xxx  than with placebo in 1 trial. whereas radiological disease progression in
 xxxd2450xxx  recipients was significantly less than that in patients receiving methotrexate or placebo in one 12-month trial, there was no difference in treatmentrelated delay in radiological disease progression after 12 and 24 months’
treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  or methotrexate in another trial.
preliminary data indicate that a combination of  xxxd2450xxx  with methotrexate
is effective in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis refractory to methotrexate
alone. however, the relative risks and benefits of using  xxxd2450xxx  with another
dmard have not been adequately evaluated.
tolerability

 xxxd2450xxx  was as well tolerated as  xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate in adult
patients with active rheumatoid arthritis over durations of up to 24 months.
the most common adverse effects (in ≥5% of recipients) with  xxxd2450xxx  were
diarrhoea (27%), respiratory infections (21%), nausea (13%), headache (13%),
rash (12%), increased serum hepatic transferases (10%), dyspepsia (10%) and
alopecia (9%), which were similar in intensity and severity to those with  xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate. of an estimated 76 000 patients who have received
treatment with  xxxd2450xxx , 16 potential cases of pancytopenia and 9 cases of
serious skin reactions have been associated with the use of the drug.
the incidence and severity of increased serum hepatic enzymes with  xxxd2450xxx  (in up to 4.4% of recipients) were similar to those with  xxxd3255xxx  (3.8%)
or methotrexate (2.7%). although human data are lacking, animal data indicate
that exposure to  xxxd2450xxx  during pregnancy has teratogenic and fetotoxic effects. the potential for male-mediated fetal toxicity with  xxxd2450xxx  has not yet
been evaluated. however, male patients wishing to father a child should discontinue drug treatment should and hastened drug elimination procedure with  xxxd1684xxx  or activated charcoal should be considered.

 xxxd2450xxx : a review

dosage and
administration

1141

treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  should be initiated with a loading dose of 100mg
administered once daily for 3 days and continued at a dosage of 20 mg/day.
dosages >20 mg/day are not recommended and the dosage may be decreased
to 10 mg/day in those who cannot tolerate 20 mg/day. serum hepatic enzymes
should be monitored before initiating treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  and then at
monthly intervals.
the dosage of  xxxd2450xxx  does not have to be modified in patients >65 years
of age, but the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.
the use of  xxxd2450xxx  is contraindicated in female patients who are pregnant
or are not using adequate contraception and in those who are breast-feeding infants. treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  is not recommended in patients with significant
hepatic impairment, positive hepatitis b or c serologies, severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow dysplasia or in those with severe uncontrolled infections.

1. antirheumatic drugs
conventional antirheumatic drugs have been
classified as either ‘symptom-modifying’ agents,
such as simple analgesics and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) and corticosteroids
or ‘disease-modifying’ agents (dmards), such as
 xxxd3255xxx , methotrexate, cyclosporin, gold, dpenicillamine,  xxxd2301xxx , azathioprine
and cyclophosphamide.[1] however, there are no
well-defined criteria for symptom or disease
modification, and it has been proposed that antirheumatic drugs be classified as either symptommodifying or disease-controlling to embrace the
concept of disease control into the classification of
these agents.[2] more recently, the rheumatoid
arthritis section of the group for the respect of
ethics and excellence in science (grees) has
suggested that antirheumatic drugs be classified as
symptom-modifying (those which relieve symptoms of pain and stiffness with or without affecting
inflammation or progress of structural changes),
inflammation-modifying (those which decrease
local or systemic inflammatory components but
may or may not alleviate symptoms) and structuremodifying (those which decrease, halt or reverse
the pathological progression of disease) for purposes of registration.[3] inclusion of a drug under
one class would not preclude inclusion under other
classes.[3] furthermore, the group has also recommended objectives for preclinical and clinical trials

and appropriate outcome measures to be used in
such studies.[3]
although a detailed discussion of the grees
recommendations is beyond the scope of this review, a summary of the relevant recommendations
regarding outcome measures to be used in clinical
trials is as follows:[3]
• symptom-modifying drug: improvement in pain
and stiffness should be the main variables, and
the primary efficacy end-points should be pain
assessment on a visual analogue scale and duration of early morning stiffness. recommended
secondary efficacy end-points include tender
joint count, patients’ and physicians’ global assessment of disease activity, and assessment of
physical function (by a generic quality-of-life
questionnaire, a disease-specific questionnaire
or by grip strength)
• inflammation-modifying drug: the main variables should be the effects on joint inflammation and acute phase response and the primary
efficacy end-points should be swollen joint
count and  xxxg520xxx  or erythrocyte
sedimentation rates, respectively. recommended secondary efficacy variables are the
same as those for symptom-modifying drugs
and may include cytokine assays
• structure-modifying drug: phase ii or iii trials
of ≥1 year’s duration should be conducted in
patients with a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. the trial may assess primary (in
patients without joint damage) or secondary
drugs 1999 dec; 58 (6)

1142

prevention (in patients with pre-existing joint
involvement) of structural damage. the main
outcome variable should be joint damage and
the primary efficacy end-point should be radiographic assessment of joint erosion or other validated imaging measurements such as magnetic
resonance imaging, dual-energy x-ray absorptionmetry or ultrasound. secondary efficacy endpoints are the same as those recommended for
symptom- or inflammation-modifying agents.
 xxxd2450xxx , a prodrug which is rapidly metabolised to its active metabolite a77 1726 (fig. 1),
reportedly possesses symptom-, inflammation- and
structure-modifying activities in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. it has been approved as a
dmard for use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the us[4] the european union,[5] central and
south america and in australia.[6]  xxxd2450xxx  is
also undergoing clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumours,[7] systemic lupus erythematosus [8] or wegener’s granulomatosis.[9] this review will focus on the efficacy of  xxxd2450xxx  in
adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.
2. pharmacodynamic properties
since  xxxd2450xxx  is rapidly converted to its
active metabolite (a77 1726) in vivo, most in vitro
pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted
with a77 1726 and not  xxxd2450xxx . three in vivo
studies have assessed the effects of  xxxd2450xxx  in
experimental models of rheumatoid arthritis in rodents[10-12] (see section 2.2).
most available pharmacodynamic data are from
in vitro studies performed in lymphocytes[13-20] and
polymorphonuclear leucocytes[21] obtained from
peripheral blood of healthy volunteers[13-18,22] or
patients with rheumatoid arthritis,[19,20] or in standard t cell lines.[23-27] some in vitro studies have
also been conducted in murine cells.[28-32]
the pharmacodynamic effects of a77 1726 are
overviewed in table i. since a77 1726 100 mumol/l
= 29.22 mg/l,[33] the concentrations of a77 1726
used in the in vitro studies (3 to 100 mumol/l or 0.88
to 29.22 mg/l) are below or similar to steady-state
plasma concentrations of a77 1726 (8.8 to 63

mg/l) achieved after oral administration of
 xxxd2450xxx  5 to 25 mg/day (see section 3).
although the precise mechanism of action of
a77 1726 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is
uncertain, in vitro data indicate that the drug inhibits dihydro- xxxd2794xxx  dehydrogenase activity (fig. 2)
and protein  xxxg2198xxx  activity in actively
dividing cells. in addition, a77 1726 has been reported to possess other effects which may contribute to the immunomodulatory action of the drug
(for details see review by fox et al.[39]).
2.1 in vitro effects
2.1.1 inhibition of dihydro- xxxd2794xxx  dehydrogenase

dihydro- xxxd2794xxx  dehydrogenase is required for
the de novo synthesis of  xxxd870xxx ,
which is a precursor for pyrimidine nucleotides, in
actively dividing cells (fig. 2). activation of lymphocytes leads to induction of dihydro- xxxd2794xxx  dehydrogenase activity. inhibition of this enzyme
leads to decreased  xxxd870xxx  levels,
decreased dna and rna synthesis, inhibition of
cell proliferation and g1 phase cell cycle arrest.
however, resting lymphocytes have low levels of
dihydro- xxxd2794xxx  dehydrogenase activity and can utilise pyrimidine nucleotides from the salvage pathdrugs 1999 dec; 58 (6)

decreased  xxxd3475xxx  (utp) levels after dihydro- xxxd2794xxx  dehydrogenase inhibition may
inhibit cell adhesion by restricting the availability
of  xxxd3476xxx -sugars which are required
for glycosylation and activation of adhesion molecules.[13] furthermore, dihydro- xxxd2794xxx  dehydrogenase activity may be involved with other cellular
functions such as immunoglobulin (ig) synthesis.[30] if  xxxd2450xxx  does exert its action through
inhibition of dihydro- xxxd2794xxx  dehydrogenase, then
exogenous uridine should be able to reverse the
effects of the drug.

and its immediate precursor, carbamoyl aspartate,[13] accumulated (depending on the ph) in a77
1726-treated human t cells in vitro.
inhibition of cell proliferation in
activated lymphocytes

in stimulated human lymphocytes, pyrimidine
levels increased to a disproportionately greater
extent than purine levels (fig. 3). a77 1726 concentration-dependently decreased pyrimidine and
purine nucleotide levels in phytohaemagglutinin
(pha)-stimulated lymphocytes (fig. 3). a77 1726
was not cytotoxic because cell numbers did not
decrease and protein concentrations in inhibited
cells remained similar to those in nonstimulated
cells after 72 hours’ exposure to a77 1726 100
mumol/l.[13] in the same study, a77 1726 25 or 50
mumol/l completely blocked the incorporation of
[14c]bicarbonate into utp and  xxxd1789xxx 
(ctp) and reduced incorporation of [14c]bicarbonate and [14c]glycine into  xxxd83xxx 
(atp) and  xxxd2247xxx  (gtp).[13] similarly, a77 1726 inhibited mitogen-induced pyrimidine nucleotide pool expansion,[41] increases
in rna and dna content[15] and cell proliferation[16,23-25] in lymphocytes obtained from the peripheral blood of volunteers[15,16] and in standard
cultures of human lymphocytes[23-25] (table i).
a77 1726 prevented the progress of stimulated
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
the g1 phase of the cell cycle to the s phase.[15] a77
1726-induced g1 phase cell cycle arrest was dependent on the presence of functional p53 protooncogene in activated peripheral blood lymphocytes and cultured cell lines.[41]
a77 1726 may also attenuate humoral immune
responses by inhibiting b cell proliferation (table
i). at concentrations similar to those which inhibit t-lymphocyte proliferation, a77 1726 concentration-dependently inhibited murine splenic bcell proliferation.[28] whereas addition of a77 1726
at the same time as the stimulus (lipopolysaccharide) led to g1 phase cell cycle arrest in b-lymphodrugs 1999 dec; 58 (6)

a77 1726 concentration-dependently decreased

burst products activate adhesion molecules, such
as  xxxg2049xxx , this may contribute to the inhibitory
effects of a77 1726 on cell adhesion.[33]

fig. 3. in vitro effects of a77 1726 on purine and pyrimidine
nucleotide pools in human peripheral blood t-lymphocytes.[13]
nucleotide levels were estimated after 72 hours’ incubation, and
isolated t-cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) with or without a77 1726 (25, 50 or 100
mumol/l). nucleotide levels in unstimulated t-cells were considered as baseline (100%). atp =  xxxd83xxx ; ctp
=  xxxd1789xxx ; gtp = guanidine triphosphate;  xxxd3474xxx 
= glycosylated  xxxd3476xxx ; utp =  xxxd3475xxx .

cytes, addition of a77 1726 39 hours after the stimulus prevented b-lymphocytes from progressing to
the g2/m phase from the s phase. incubation of
stimulated cells with a77 1726 50 mumol/l for 48
hours led to a 3-fold decrease in cyclin-dependent
kinase-2 ( xxxg410xxx ) protein levels compared with untreated cells, and decreased  xxxg410xxx  levels correlated
with inhibition of progress through the s phase of
the cell cycle.[28]
a combination of  xxxd2450xxx  with cyclosporin
or sirolimus (rapamycin) exerted additive to synergistic inhibitory effects on lymphocyte proliferation.[16] the combination of  xxxd2450xxx  10 to 50
mug/l with cyclosporin 6.25 to 100 nmol/l synergistically inhibited [3h]thymidine incorporation
into lymphocytes obtained from healthy volunteers.[16] on the other hand, the combination of
 xxxd2450xxx  10 to 50 mumol/l with sirolimus 0.01
to 1 nmol/l exerted additive or synergistic effects
on inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation.[16]

the effects of a77 1726 25 and 50 mumol/l on
pyrimidine and purine nucleotide pool expansion
and cell proliferation were reversed by pretreatment of cultured t cells with uridine 50 mumol/l.[13]
in cells exposed to a77 1726 25 or 50 mumol/l,
pretreatment with uridine restored incorporation
of [14c]bicarbonate and [14c]glycine into atp and
gtp, but not of [14c]bicarbonate into utp and
ctp.[13] these findings suggest that although uridine 50 mumol/l restored t cell proliferation and
synthesis of purine nucleotides, pyrimidine biosynthesis remained inhibited in a77 1726-treated
t cells. the inhibition of purine nucleotide synthesis by a77 1726 was secondary to its inhibitory
effects on t cell proliferation because it was reversed by uridine. on the other hand, uridine 50
mumol/l was unable to reverse the effects of a77
1726 100 mumol/l indicating complete metabolic
stasis in t cells[13] or additional mechanisms of
action at this concentration. similarly, reversal of
the antiproliferative effects of a77 1726 3 to 100
mumol/l were reported with uridine or cytidine 0.5
to 100 mumol/l in other in vitro studies.[16,23]
 xxxd2450xxx  and cyclosporin inhibit cell proliferation by different mechanisms. inhibition of
incorporation of radiolabelled thymidine in blood
samples obtained from  xxxd2450xxx - or cyclosporintreated rats was used as an indirect measure of the
antiproliferative effects of the drugs.[42] a single
oral 5 mg/kg dose of  xxxd2450xxx  or cyclosporin
decreased cell proliferation in whole blood samples.[42] whereas addition of uridine 2 mmol/l
restored cell proliferation in cells isolated from
 xxxd2450xxx -treated animals, uridine had no antagdrugs 1999 dec; 58 (6)

onistic activity in cells from cyclosporin-treated
animals.[42]
similar to studies in human t cells, uridine 125
mumol/l completely restored uridine nucleotide
pools and reversed the inhibitory effects of a77
1726 50 mumol/l on murine splenic b cell proliferation and igm production.[30] however, uridine
125 mumol/l could not completely reverse a77
1726-induced inhibition of igg production in murine splenic b cells indicating that an alternative
mechanism must be responsible for this effect.[30]
2.1.2 inhibition of protein  xxxg2198xxx 

because normal serum uridine levels may antagonise the antiproliferative effects of a77 1726
in vivo[29] and uridine 50 mumol/l was unable to
reverse the effects of a77 1726 100 mumol/l in
vitro,[13] it has been suggested that inhibition of
protein  xxxg2198xxx  by a77 1726 may be responsible for its therapeutic effect in mice with
lymphoproliferative disease and in immortalised
lymphoid cell lines.[29,31,43] although concentrations of a77 1726 required to inhibit  xxxg2198xxx  activity are 5- to 1000-fold higher than those
required to inhibit dihydro- xxxd2794xxx  dehydrogenase,[44,45] the concentrations of a77 1726 that are
reported to inhibit protein  xxxg2198xxx  (25 to
100 mumol/l)[29,31] are achieved in the plasma of
patients with rheumatoid arthritis after oral administration of  xxxd2450xxx  (see section 3).
2.1.3 other effects

a77 1726 is also reported to possess other
activities, such as concentration-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor-kappab activation and nuclear
factor-kappab-dependent reporter gene expression,[27]
induction of cyclo-oxygenase activity,[21] oxygen
radical production,[22] and igm and igg production,[30] which may contribute to its immunomodulatory effects (table i).
in other studies, a77 1726 increased the production of the immunosuppressive transforming
growth factor- xxxg836xxx  protein and inhibited proinflammatory interleukin (il)-2 levels[14] and inhibited
the expression of cell surface il-2 and transferrin
receptors in quiescent peripheral blood lymphocytes[17,18] (table i).

a77 1726 led to more pronounced inhibition of
proinflammatory  xxxg1170xxx  expression and the tissue
destructive enzyme (metalloproteinase-1) production than of the natural  xxxd2806xxx  or
the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (table i).
these effects of a77 1726 were more favourable
than those of dexamethasone, which was less
selective for  xxxg1170xxx  or metalloproteinase-1 than
for  xxxd2806xxx  or tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase-1.[26]
 xxxd2450xxx  may be considered an immunomodulator, rather than an immunosuppressive agent
because it did not affect phagocytosis by human
granulocytes,[33] or inhibit  xxxg1173xxx  synthesis
in murine t cells. in contrast to cyclosporin, a77
1726 did not decrease il-4 production or  xxxg1175xxx  expression in stimulated murine t cells.[32]
2.2 efficacy in animal models of arthritis

immunisation of balb/c mice with fetal human proteoglycan depleted of chondroitin sulphate
produces progressive polyarthritis and ankylosing
spondylitis that shows many similarities to human
rheumatoid arthritis and  xxxg1055xxx .[12]
treatment with oral  xxxd2450xxx  2.5 to 35 mg/kg
per day was effective in experimental models of
arthritis. improvement in signs of arthritis was
reported from the second week onwards in mice
with fetal human proteoglycan-induced arthritis receiving oral  xxxd2450xxx  35 mg/kg/day compared
with untreated controls in a 12-week study.[12] in
addition, treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  led to decreases in circulating antibodies to immunising
fetal human proteoglycan and autoantibodies to
mouse proteoglycan. since the decline in autoantibody titres was strongly correlated with regression
of inflammatory events after  xxxd2450xxx , the investigators hypothesised that suppression of autoantibodies may be important for the therapeutic
effect of the drug in patients with seropositive
rheumatoid arthritis.[12]
oral  xxxd2450xxx  5 and 10 mg/kg/day for 26
days significantly decreased joint swelling (p <
0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) and arthritis score
(p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) compared
drugs 1999 dec; 58 (6)

 xxxd2450xxx : a review

with untreated controls in rats with antigen-induced
arthritis.[10] reductions in joint swelling and arthritis score with oral  xxxd2450xxx  10 mg/kg/day
were similar to those with intraperitoneal cyclosporin 5 mg/kg/day at end-point. compared with
saline-treated animals, rats treated with  xxxd2450xxx  had significantly lower levels of serum antibodies to matrix components collagen types i (p <
0.05) and ii (p < 0.01) and proteoglycan (p < 0.01)
at end-point.[10]
histological evidence of joint damage was significantly lower in animals treated with oral  xxxd2450xxx  compared with untreated controls. mice
with adjuvant-induced arthritis treated with oral
 xxxd2450xxx  35 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks had moderate joint cartilage damage on histological examination compared with complete deterioration of the
articular surface in untreated animals.[12] however,
mild clinical signs of inflammation reappeared 2
to 3 weeks after discontinuing treatment with
 xxxd2450xxx .[12] histological scores for arthritis in
the knee joint of rats treated with oral  xxxd2450xxx 
5 and 10 mg/kg/day were significantly lower than
those in saline-treated controls (p < 0.01 and p <
0.001, respectively).[10]
the beneficial effects of  xxxd2450xxx  on joint
damage may be synergistic with those of cyclosporin. whereas histological scores for synovitis
in rats treated with 1 mg/kg per day of either oral
 xxxd2450xxx  or intraperitoneal cyclosporin were
similar to those in saline-treated controls, they
were significantly (p < 0.01) reduced in animals
treated with a combination of the 2 agents.[10]
3. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2450xxx 
and a77 1726 are summarised in table ii. orally
administered  xxxd2450xxx  was rapidly metabolised
to a77 1726, but the precise site of  xxxd2450xxx 
metabolism is unknown; in vitro and in vivo data
indicate that  xxxd2450xxx  may be converted to its
active metabolite in the gut wall, plasma and in the
liver.[46] both the cytosolic and microsomal fractions of liver cells have been proposed as sites of
drug metabolism.[46]

increases in plasma a77 1726 concentrations
were related to the administered dose of  xxxd2450xxx . the drug is very highly plasma protein bound
and, correspondingly, has a low apparent volume
of distribution. a77 1726 undergoes enterohepatic
circulation and biliary recycling may contribute to
its long elimination half-life (≈2 weeks). because
of the long elimination half-life of a77 1726, it
is recommended that treatment with  xxxd2450xxx 
should be initiated with a loading dose of 100mg
once daily for 3 days to hasten attainment of
steady-state plasma concentrations (see section 6).
without the loading dose, it is estimated that it
would require nearly 2 months of dosing to attain
steady-state plasma a77 1726 concentrations.[46]
almost half (48%) of an administered dose was
excreted in faeces; renal elimination accounted for
43% of the administered dose.
whereas age and gender did not display any
consistent effects on the pharmacokinetics of a77
1726 in vivo,[46] plasma a77 1726 free fraction concentrations were higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis than in healthy volunteers (table ii).
smokers tend to clear the drug at a faster rate than
nonsmokers. however, the clinical significance of
these findings is uncertain.[46] after a single dose
of  xxxd2450xxx , 6 patients with chronic renal insufficiency had approximately 2-fold higher plasma
a77 1726 free fraction concentrations than those
in healthy volunteers, and plasma a77 1726 concentrations were unaffected by haemodialysis or
chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.[47] finally,
the effects of hepatic dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics of a77 1726 are unknown.[46]
some investigators have hypothesised that
autoinduction of hepatic enzymes by repeated administration of oral  xxxd2450xxx  may be responsible for the dose- and time-dependent increases in
clearance and apparent volume of distribution observed in rats,[49] but no data are available in humans.

urine (primarily as  xxxd2450xxx  glucuronides and an oxanilic acid derivative of a77 1726) after administration of a single radiolabelled dose
of  xxxd2450xxx  in a 28-day trial in 3 healthy volunteers[47]
special patient populations
patients with rheumatoid arthritis: increased plasma free fraction of a77 1726 versus that in healthy volunteers (0.8 vs 0.62%)[47]
patients with chronic renal insufficiency: haemodialysis or chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis had no effect on plasma a77 1726
concentrations, but plasma free fraction was higher than that in healthy volunteers (1.51 vs 0.62%) in a single dose trial[47]
smokers: 38% increase in clearance compared with that in nonsmokers
drug interactions
plasma a77 1726 concentrations decreased rapidly after administration of  xxxd1684xxx  (n = 96) or activated charcoal (n = 1) in healthy
volunteers[47]
no pharmacokinetic interaction was reported in patients after coadministration of  xxxd2450xxx  (100 mg/day for 2 days followed by 10-20
mg/day) with methotrexate (10-25 mg/week) and  xxxd2146xxx 
administration of multiple doses of rifampicin (rifampin) 600mg once daily for 8 days in healthy volunteers increased peak plasma a77
1726 concentrations after oral  xxxd2450xxx  100mg by ≈40%[48]
repeated administration of oral  xxxd2450xxx  (100mg once daily for 3 days followed by 20 mg/day for 17 days) had no pharmacokinetic
interaction with triphasic oral contraceptive pills in 32 premenopausal female volunteers[48]
plasma a77 1726 concentrations after oral  xxxd2450xxx  100mg were similar with or without 6 days’ pretreatment with oral cimetidine

inhibits  xxxg587xxx  in vitro and increases free fraction of diclofenac, ibuprofen and  xxxd3394xxx  by 13 to 50%
warfarin did not affect protein binding of a77 1726 in vitro

since it may take up to 2 years for plasma
a77 1726 concentrations to fall below detectable
levels after discontinuation of  xxxd2450xxx , the
manufacturer recommends treatment with oral
 xxxd1684xxx  or activated charcoal in cases of
overdosage or if it becomes necessary to hasten
drug elimination.[46] oral  xxxd1684xxx  8g 3
times a day for 24 hours decreased plasma a77
1726 concentrations by 48% after 24 hours and by
49 to 65% after 48 hours in 3 healthy volunteers.[47]
similarly, administration of activated charcoal 50g
every 6 hours for 24 hours, either orally or via
nasogastric tube, led to a 37% decrease in plasma
a77 1726 concentrations after 24 hours and a 48%
decrease after 48 hours.[50] treatment with  xxxd1684xxx  8g 3 times daily for 11 days is recom© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

mended to achieve undetectable plasma a77 1726
concentrations (<0.02 mg/l).[50]
despite the lack of a pharmacokinetic interaction,[51] coadministration of  xxxd2450xxx  with
methotrexate may increase the incidence of abnormally high alt and ast levels in patients (see
section 5.1.1).
in a crossover study in healthy volunteers, mean
plasma a77 1726 concentrations were higher after
administration of oral rifampicin (rifampin) 600mg
once daily for 12 days and a single dose of oral
 xxxd2450xxx  100mg on day 8 than after a single oral

ine[48] (table ii). in addition, inhibition of ovulation
with a triphasic oral contraceptive pill was not affected by concomitant administration of  xxxd2450xxx  in 32 premenopausal female volunteers[48]
(fig. 4).
in vitro data indicate that  xxxd2450xxx  (or a77
1726) inhibits cytochrome p450 (cyp) 2c9 enzyme and may, therefore, have the potential to interact with diclofenac, ibuprofen and  xxxd3394xxx .
however, no apparent drug interactions have been
reported after coadministration of  xxxd2450xxx 
with nsaids in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
in clinical trials (see section 4).
3.2 pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic correlation

the probability of achieving clinical success in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis was significantly
(p < 0.0001) correlated with the dosage and steadystate plasma a77 1726 concentrations (css).[52] using a population pharmacokinetic model in 398 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received
placebo or  xxxd2450xxx  5, 10 or 25mg once daily
in a phase ii trial, it was calculated that the probability of being a responder was significantly
greater in the 10 and 25mg treatment groups than
in the placebo group.[52] individual css values were
better predictors of treatment success than the dosage, and the probability of clinical success increased from 25% in the placebo group to 60% at
c ss values >13 mg/l. further increases in css
were not associated with a corresponding increase
in the probability of clinical success.
taking into account the median a77 1726 clearance rates and interindividual variability in a77
1726 clearance in the above calculation it was
estimated that the maximum probability of achieving clinical success in 95% of  xxxd2450xxx  recipients would be at css of 30 mg/l (achieved with once
daily  xxxd2450xxx  16mg). thus, a daily dosage of
 xxxd2450xxx  20mg, which would achieve a maximum probability of clinical success in 99% of recipients, was recommended for phase iii trials.[52]

4. therapeutic use
the efficacy of monotherapy with  xxxd2450xxx 
has been evaluated in 1 large dose-ranging trial[53]
and in 3 large randomised, double-blind, comparative multicentre trials in adult patients with active
rheumatoid arthritis[54-56] (table iii). the efficacy
of  xxxd2450xxx  combined with methotrexate was
evaluated in a small nonblind trial in 30 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis refractory to methotrexate alone.[51] whereas the results of the doseranging phase ii trial[53] and 1 phase iii trial (versus
enteric-coated  xxxd3255xxx  2 g/day)[56] after 6
months have been published in full, the complete
results of the other 2 phase iii trials (versus methotrexate 7.5 to 15 mg/week) of 12[55] and 24[54]
months’ duration are unpublished. in addition, patients in a 24-week trial[56] continued to receive
trial medication in a double-blind manner for a further period of up to 24 months and the results have
recently been published as an abstract.[59]

 xxxd2450xxx : a review

active disease was defined by the presence of
≥6 tender joints, ≥6 swollen joints, overall rheumatoid arthritis activity assessed as fair, poor or very
poor by the physician and patient,  xxxg520xxx  level (crp) ≥20 mg/l or esr ≥28 mm/h in 2
trials.[54,56] in the remaining trials, active disease
was defined by the presence of 3 of the 4 following
criteria: ≥8 tender joints, ≥8 swollen joints, morning stiffness ≥45 minutes, and westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) ≥40 mm/h;[53] or ≥9
tender joints, ≥6 swollen joints, morning stiffness
≥45 minutes, and esr ≥40 mm/h.[55] refractory
rheumatoid arthritis was defined as persistent disease activity (3 of the following 4 criteria: ≥8
swollen joints, ≥10 tender joints, esr ≥28 mm/h,
morning stiffness ≥45 minutes) despite at least 6
months’ treatment with methotrexate ≥15 mg/week
(or ≥10 mg/week in patients unable to tolerate
higher dosages).[51]
in all 4 double-blind trials, the primary outcome
measures of treatment efficacy included tender and
swollen joint counts (based on an evaluation of
66 or 68 joints in 1 trial[53] or 28 joints in other
trials[54-56]), and physician’s and patient’s global
assessment of treatment-related change in disease
activity (table iii).
treatment responders were appropriately defined, according to the american college of rheumatology (acr) 20 criteria[58] in all 4 trials (table
iii). the acr 20 criteria, reported to clearly discriminate between active and placebo treatment,[58] requires ≥20% improvement in tender
joint counts, swollen joint counts and in ≥3 of the
following 5 measures: patient’s or physician’s
global assessment of disease activity, patient’s assessment of pain intensity and functional ability,
and either crp levels or esr.[58]
secondary outcome measures of treatment efficacy included duration of morning stiffness,
change in grip strength, stanford health assessment questionnaire (haq), patient-rated pain
score, esr values, crp levels and rheumatoid factor levels in 2 trials.[53,56]
reduction in functional disability was evaluated using the haq [60] in 3 trials. haq evalu© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

ates functional ability by measuring 9 general component categories (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, outside activity, sex) on
a scale of 0 (without difficulty) to 3 (unable to
do).[60] the results were expressed either as the
change in total haq score[53] or as a disability index (dividing the total haq score by the total number of components answered).[55,56] in addition
to haq, improvement in functional ability and
health-related quality of life (hrqol) from baseline values with  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate
were evaluated using scales such as the modified
haq (mhaq), weighted top 5 score of the problem elicitation technique (pet), the medical outcomes survey short form 36 (sf-36) physical and
mental components and work productivity in 1
trial.[55]
4.1 onset of action

dmards are also called ‘slow-acting antirheumatic drugs’ because the onset of therapeutic effect
commonly varies from 6 weeks to 6 months (reviewed by ahern and chandran[61]). on the other
hand, patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx  experienced significantly (p ≤ 0.001) greater improvements in all primary outcome measures than placebo recipients at 4 weeks (all values estimated
from graphs): tender joint count (–6 vs –2.4);
swollen joint count (–3.6 vs –1.2), physician’s
global assessment (–0.78 vs –0.35) and patient’s
global assessment (–0.8 vs –0.35).[56] in addition,
decreases in 4 of the 6 secondary outcome measures (pain intensity, crp levels, esr and haq)
were also significantly greater (p ≤ 0.001) with
 xxxd2450xxx  than with placebo after 4 weeks. although decreases in morning stiffness and rheumatoid factor levels were greater with  xxxd2450xxx  than
placebo, the difference between the 2 groups was
not statistically significant.[56]
after 4 weeks, significantly greater improvement was reported with  xxxd2450xxx  than with  xxxd3255xxx  in all primary outcome measures (all
values estimated from graphs; p ≤0.03) including
tender joint count (–6.0 vs –3.0), swollen joint
count (–3.6 vs –1.5), physician’s global assessment
drugs 1999 dec; 58 (6)

1152

(–0.78 vs –0.5) and patient’s global assessment
(–0.8 vs –0.65), and in 4 of 6 secondary outcome
measures (pain intensity, haq, crp levels and
rheumatoid factor levels).[56] whereas  xxxd2450xxx 
was administered with a loading dose (100 mg/day
for 3 days) before commencing treatment with
20mg once daily,  xxxd3255xxx  was administered in
gradually increasing dosages (0.5 g/day during the
first week, and 1, 1.5 and 2 g/day during weeks 2,
3, and 4, respectively)[56] which is reported to improve gastrointestinal tolerance.[62] the  xxxd2450xxx  loading dose may therefore be responsible for
the faster onset of action versus  xxxd3255xxx .[56]
 xxxd2450xxx  appeared to have a quicker onset
of action than methotrexate in a large randomised,
double-blind trial. during the first 12 weeks, the
mean time to the first acr 20 response was significantly shorter in patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx 
than methotrexate (74 vs 101 days, p < 0.05).[54]
4.2 efficacy at end-point

the efficacy of  xxxd2450xxx  5, 10 and 25 mg/day
was dose dependent in a 24-week trial in patients
with active rheumatoid arthritis[53] (table iii). at
end-point, improvements from baseline values
in all primary outcome measures (swollen joint
counts, tender joint count, physician’s global assessment and patient’s global assessment) were
significantly (p < 0.05) greater with  xxxd2450xxx  25
mg/day than with placebo (table iii). furthermore,
a significantly (p < 0.05) greater proportion of
 xxxd2450xxx  25 mg/day recipients met the acr 20
criteria for treatment response than placebo recipients[53] (table iii).
 xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day was as effective as
 xxxd3255xxx  at 6 months but was significantly
more effective than  xxxd3255xxx  at 24 months in a
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.[56,63]
after 6 months’ treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  20
mg/day,  xxxd3255xxx  2 g/day or placebo, significantly greater improvement from baseline values
in all primary outcome measures was reported with
 xxxd2450xxx  versus placebo (table iii). in addition,
significantly (p = 0.001) more  xxxd2450xxx  or sul© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

fasalazine recipients were treatment responders
compared with placebo recipients. the trial comparing the efficacy of  xxxd2450xxx  with that of
 xxxd3255xxx  was not adequately powered to
demonstrate equivalence between the 2 treatments,
and the magnitude of difference between the 2
treatment groups has been described by 95% confidence intervals (ci).[56] improvement from baseline in all primary outcome measures in  xxxd2450xxx  recipients was similar to that in  xxxd3255xxx 
recipients: tender joint score (ci –2.42, 1.11);
swollen joint score (ci –2.19, 0.68); physician’s
global assessment (ci –0.23, 0.21) and patient’s
global assessment (ci –0.28, 0.19).[56] after 6
months, patients treated with  xxxd2450xxx  (n = 60)
or  xxxd3255xxx  (n = 57) continued to receive trial
medication and patients who had initially received
placebo were switched to  xxxd3255xxx  for a further
period of up to 24 months.[63] after 24 months,
 xxxd2450xxx  was significantly (p < 0.01) more effective than  xxxd3255xxx  according to the change
from baseline in physicians’ global assessment
(–1.5 vs –1.1), patients’ global assessment (–1.6 vs
–1) and in acr 20 responder rate (82 vs 60%).[63]
although change from baseline in the swollen joint
count was greater in  xxxd2450xxx  recipients than in
patients treated with  xxxd3255xxx , the difference
between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (–10.5 vs –7.9).[63]
although 12 months’ treatment with once daily
 xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day was as effective as methotrexate 7.5 to 15 mg/week in 1[55] but not in the
other trial,[54] both drugs had broadly similar efficacy after 24 months.[54] 999 adult patients were
randomised to receive  xxxd2450xxx  (n = 501) or
methotrexate (n = 498) in a double-blind multicentre trial.[54] after 12 months, methotrexate was
significantly more effective than  xxxd2450xxx  as
evidenced by a greater change from baseline values
in all primary efficacy parameters: total joint count
(–9.7 vs –8.3, p < 0.01); swollen joint count (–9 vs
–6.8, p = 0.0001); physicians’ global assessment
(–1.2 vs –0.9, p < 0.001) and patients’ global assessment (–1.2 vs –0.9, p < 0.001). at the end of
the 12-month period, 612 patients continued to

 xxxd2450xxx : a review

receive treatment for a further 12 months in a
double-blind manner. at 24 months, although
changes from baseline values in the swollen joint
count and physicians’ global assessment were significantly greater with methotrexate than with
 xxxd2450xxx , there was no statistically significant
difference between the 2 treatment groups in total
joint count, patients’ global assessment or acr 20
responder rate[54] (table iii). on the other hand,
improvements from baseline values in all primary
efficacy parameters were significantly greater with
once daily  xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day or methotrexate
7.5 to 15 mg/day than with placebo, and there was
no difference between the  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate treatment groups in another 12-month randomised, double-blind multicentre trial[55] (table
iii). the overall response over the duration of these
2 trials,[54,55] assessed by an area-under-the-curve
(auc) analysis of the response rate according
to the acr 20 criteria, revealed that  xxxd2450xxx 
was equivalent to methotrexate.[64] the mean auc
in  xxxd2450xxx  recipients was similar to that in
patients receiving methotrexate:[64] 23 vs 25.4
weeks[54] and 23.7 vs 22.7 weeks.[55]
4.2.1 effects on functional disability

 xxxd2450xxx  was significantly more effective
than placebo, methotrexate or  xxxd3255xxx , in decreasing functional disability in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. at 6 months, reductions
in haq total score from baseline values with
 xxxd2450xxx  10 and 25 mg/day (–14.5 and –13.6,
respectively), but not with  xxxd2450xxx  5 mg/day
(–5.8), were significantly (p < 0.05) greater than
those with placebo (–8.1) in the dose-finding
trial.[53]
the effects of  xxxd2450xxx , methotrexate or placebo on functional ability in a randomised, doubleblind, multicentre trial [55] have been reported
separately.[65] at 12 months, the reduction in functional disability with  xxxd2450xxx  was significantly greater than that with placebo or methotrexate[65] (fig. 5). reduction in the functional
disability from baseline (as measured on the haq
disability index) after 6 months’ treatment with
 xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day was significantly greater

1153

than with placebo (–0.5 vs –0.04, p ≤ 0.001) or
 xxxd3255xxx  (–0.5 vs –0.29, p < 0.03) in another
randomised, double-blind trial.[56] significantly
greater improvement in functional ability with
 xxxd2450xxx  than with  xxxd3255xxx  persisted until
the end of the extended 24-month period (change
from baseline in haq disability index: –0.65 vs
–0.36, p < 0.01).[63]
4.2.2 effects on radiological
progression of disease

slowing the rate of progression of joint damage is one of the goals of management of patients
with rheumatoid arthritis.[66] published reviews indicate that methotrexate,[67]  xxxd3255xxx ,[62] gold
salts and cyclophosphamide,[68] but not  xxxd2870xxx ,  xxxd2301xxx  or azathioprine,[68] are
effective in slowing the radiological progression
of disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
 xxxd2450xxx  was at least as effective as  xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate in decreasing the rate of
radiological progression of disease over periods
of 6 to 12 months in 3 randomised, double-blind,
multicentre trials in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.[69] radiological articular damage
was assessed using the method described by larsen
in 2 trials[54,56] and using the method described by
sharp in the other trial.[55] both methods are reported to be reliable and effective in the assessment
of treatment effect on radiological progression of
disease.[70]
after 6 months’ treatment, the rate of progression of joint erosions was significantly slower in
patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day or  xxxd3255xxx  2 g/day than in patients receiving placebo (increase from baseline in eroded joint count
0.42, 0.41 vs 1.4, p < 0.001). in addition, radiological progression of the disease was slower in patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx  or  xxxd3255xxx  compared with that in placebo recipients: changes
from baseline subscores for the hands (0.01, 0.01
vs 0.05, p < 0.025) and feet (0.01, 0.02 vs 0.06,
p < 0.025).[56] the beneficial effects of  xxxd2450xxx  (n = 28) and  xxxd3255xxx  (n = 27) on radiological progression of disease were maintained during
the 24-month double-blind extension phase of this

20 mg/day (n = 131), methotrexate 7.5 to 15
mg/week (n = 138) or placebo (n = 83) at baseline:
mean total radiographic scores according to the
modified sharp method were 23.11, 22.76 and
25.37, respectively.[55] after 12 months’ treatment,
radiological disease progression in  xxxd2450xxx  recipients was significantly slower than that in methotrexate or placebo recipients, and rate of disease
progression was less than the estimated yearly increase without treatment in all groups (fig. 6). furthermore, disease progression on other radiographic parameters was also significantly slower in
 xxxd2450xxx  recipients than in placebo recipients:
change in erosion subscore (0.23 vs 0.89, p < 0.05)
and in joint space narrowing subscore (0.31 vs
1.24, p <0.001).[55] however, radiological progression of disease with  xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day (n =
295) was similar to that with methotrexate 10 to 15
mg/week (n = 315) after 12 and 24 months in
another randomised, double-blind, multicentre
trial in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.[54,71] treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  or methotrexate led to similar changes from baseline in mean
total larsen scores (0.03 vs 0.03) and mean total
joints with erosions (1.2 vs 1.3) at 12 months,[71]
but numerical values have not been provided at 24

the use of combinations of dmards is increasing and a survey of 200 us rheumatologists
in 1997 revealed that combinations of dmards
were being used by 99% of rheumatologists to treat
24% of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis.[72]
furthermore, the results of a recent trial suggest
that combination therapy may be more effective
than monontherapy in delaying radiological progression of joint damage in patients with early, active rheumatoid arthritis.[73]
since  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate have different biochemical mechanisms of action, a combination of these 2 drugs may be useful in patients
not responding to methotrexate alone.[74] the results of a small noncomparative trial indicate that
the addition of  xxxd2450xxx  was effective in 30 padrugs 1999 dec; 58 (6)

5. tolerability
 xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day was generally well
tolerated in 3 randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled multicentre trials in patients with active
rheumatoid arthritis.[46,53,56,75] in addition, tolerability data are available from a small trial in 30
patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis receiving  xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day with methotrexate
17.2 mg/week (mean dose).[51]
5.1 general adverse event profile

the nature and incidence of adverse events in
patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day were similar to those in patients receiving  xxxd3255xxx  2

table iv. adverse events were generally of mild
to moderate intensity and necessitated drug withdrawal in 14, 19 and 7% of  xxxd2450xxx ,  xxxd3255xxx  and placebo recipients, respectively, in 1
trial.[56]
serious treatment-related adverse events were
reported in 5% of patients in the  xxxd2450xxx  and
placebo groups and in 7% of patients receiving  xxxd3255xxx  in a randomised trial.[56] two  xxxd3255xxx -treated patients developed infections and high
fever associated with severe agranulocytosis; one
recovered spontaneously 4 weeks after discontinuation of the drug and the other required treatment
with granulocyte  xxxg526xxx . in
another trial, serious adverse events were reported
in 1.1% of patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx , and in
2.7 and 1.7% of patients receiving methotrexate
and placebo, respectively.[55] during 24 months’
treatment with methotrexate, treatment-related
interstitial pneumonitis was reported in 5 patients
and resulted in 1 death, and pancytopenia was reported in 1 patient who died with pneumonia.[54]

pre-existing hypertension was over-represented in the
 xxxd2450xxx  group and analysis of new-onset hypertension
revealed no difference between the treatment groups.

related leukopenia was reported in 8 patients and
led to drug discontinuation in 3 patients.[54] of an
estimated 76 000 patients treated with  xxxd2450xxx ,
16 potential cases of pancytopenia and 9 cases of
serious skin reactions have been associated with
the use of the drug.[6] most of the haematological
reactions occurred when  xxxd2450xxx  was administered with or immediately after another dmard
or after treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  had been
switched to another dmard with haematological
toxicity such as methotrexate. it has been hypothesised that the haematological reactions may have
been due to direct toxicity of a77 1726 and the skin
reactions may represent hypersensitivity to the
drug.[6]

whereas an aetiological role of methotrexate
has been suggested in the development of lymphomas in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, especially
in those with long-standing and severe disease and
significant comorbidity,[76] the incidence of malignancies or lymphoproliferative disorders was not
increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
who received  xxxd2450xxx  for up to 24 months in
clinical trials.[53,54,56,77] however, long term trials
in larger numbers of patients are required to accurately assess the risk of these adverse events in
 xxxd2450xxx -treated patients.[46]
of 30 patients who received treatment with
 xxxd2450xxx  in combination with methotrexate for
12 months, 3 patients withdrew prematurely because of elevation of hepatic enzymes.[51] other
adverse events were of mild to moderate intensity
and the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea, nausea, stomatitis), respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, infection), alopecia, rash and urinary tract infections.
no clinically relevant haematological abnormality
or alteration in renal function was observed in any
patient.[51]
5.1.1 effects on hepatic enzymes

the incidence and severity of increased serum
hepatic enzyme levels with  xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day
were similar to those after  xxxd3255xxx  2 g/day
or methotrexate 7.5 to 15 mg/week in placebocontrolled comparative trials. during 6 months’
treatment, elevated [≥3-fold greater than upper
limit of normal (uln)] serum hepatic enzyme
levels (alkaline phosphatase, alt, ast) were reported in 2.3 and 3.8% of patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx  and  xxxd3255xxx , respectively, but not in
any of the 92 placebo recipients.[56] treatment was
withdrawn because of elevated serum hepatic enzymes in 2 patients each in the  xxxd2450xxx  and
 xxxd3255xxx  groups and in 1 placebo recipient.[56]
increases in serum alt levels (>3-fold greater than
uln) were reported in 4.4 and 2.7% of patients
during 12 months’ treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  and
methotrexate, respectively, and in 2.5% of placebo
recipients in another comparative trial.[55] in this
trial treatment withdrawal because of elevated sedrugs 1999 dec; 58 (6)

 xxxd2450xxx : a review

rum hepatic enzyme levels was reported in 7.1 and
4.4% of  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate recipients,
respectively, and in 1.7% of placebo recipients.[55]
preliminary evidence obtained in a noncomparative trial suggests that serum alt levels may
need to be monitored frequently in patients being
treated with a combination of  xxxd2450xxx  and
methotrexate (see section 6.1). 19 of 30 patients
with refractory rheumatoid arthritis treated with
 xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate for 6 months had
serum alt levels above normal limits: <2-fold
greater than uln in 8 patients; ≥2 to <3-fold
greater than uln in 6 patients and >3-fold greater
than uln in 5 patients.[51] further study is needed
to determine the frequency of transaminase elevations in patients receiving a combination of
 xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate.
5.2 potential for teratogenicity
and fetotoxicity

the administration of any dmard during
pregnancy is associated with the potential for or
proven teratogenic and fetotoxic effects.[78] although human data are lacking, animal data indicate that exposure to  xxxd2450xxx  during pregnancy has teratogenic and fetotoxic effects.
exposure of rabbits to  xxxd2450xxx  10 mg/kg bodyweight (equivalent to human exposure based on
auc) during fetal organogenesis was associated with fused, dysplastic sternabrae in the offspring.[46] anophthalmia or micro-ophthalmia and
internal hydrocephalus were reported in the offspring of rats given oral  xxxd2450xxx  15 mg/kg
bodyweight (≈10% the human exposure level
based on auc) during fetal organogenesis. in
addition, embryolethality was increased and fetal
bodyweight was decreased in surviving fetuses.[46]
postnatal survival was decreased by >90% in the
offspring of rats given oral  xxxd2450xxx  1.25 mg/kg
bodyweight (≈1% the human exposure based on
auc) from 14 days before mating until the end of
lactation.[46]

6. dosage and administration
 xxxd2450xxx  is indicated in adult patients with
active rheumatoid arthritis to reduce signs and
symptoms of disease and to retard structural damage. treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  should be initiated with a loading dose of 100 mg/day administered once daily for 3 days to hasten attainment
of c ss (section 3), and continued at a dosage of
20 mg/day. the drug may be administered without
regard to meals (see section 3). if the 20 mg/day
dosage is not well tolerated then the dosage may
be decreased to 10 mg/day. dosages >20 mg/day
are not recommended.[46]
treatment with aspirin ( xxxd234xxx ),
other nsaids or low dose corticosteroids may
be continued in patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx .[46]
the concomitant use of  xxxd2450xxx  with other
dmards, such as  xxxd2301xxx , oral or
parenteral gold,  xxxd2870xxx , azathioprine or
methotrexate, has not been adequately studied.[46]
because recent treatment with a haematotoxic or
hepatotoxic dmard may increase the risk of adverse effects with  xxxd2450xxx , a careful assessment of risks and benefits should be made before
initiating treatment with  xxxd2450xxx .[6] the use of
 xxxd2450xxx  with methotrexate is not advisable in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis due to the increased risk of pancytopenia (see section 5.1).[6]
the dosage of  xxxd2450xxx  does not have to be
modified in patients aged >65 years. since plasma
a77 1726 free fraction concentrations are higher
in patients with chronic renal insufficiency than in
healthy volunteers and a77 1726 is not dialysable
(see section 3), the drug should be used with caution in those with renal impairment.[46] there are
no data on the safety or efficacy of  xxxd2450xxx  in
children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and the
drug is not recommended for use in patients <18
years of age.[46]
 xxxd2450xxx  is contraindicated in patients who
are hypersensitive to the drug or any of its excipients. furthermore, the manufacturer does not recommend treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  in patients
with significant hepatic impairment, positive hepatitis b or c serologies, severe immunodeficiency,
drugs 1999 dec; 58 (6)

1158

bone marrow dysplasia or in those with severe uncontrolled infections. live vaccines such as bcg,
measles, rubella, mumps and oral polio vaccine,
should not be administered to patients receiving
 xxxd2450xxx .[46]
the use of  xxxd2450xxx  is contraindicated in
female patients who are pregnant or who are not
using adequate contraception and in those who are
breast-feeding infants (see section 5.2). although
the specific risk of male-mediated fetal toxicity has
not been assessed in animal studies, the manufacturer recommends that prior to attempting to father
a child, men should discontinue treatment with
 xxxd2450xxx  and treatment with  xxxd1684xxx  8g
3 times daily for 11 days, to hasten drug elimination, should be considered.[46] drug elimination
with  xxxd1684xxx  or activated charcoal is also
recommended prior to conception in female patients wishing to conceive.
6.1 monitoring of liver function
and dosage titration

persistent drug-induced elevation of serum hepatic enzymes (e.g. ast) ≥3-fold greater than the
uln warrant treatment withdrawal even in the absence of symptoms.[79] levels <2-fold greater than
the uln are often self-limited and indicate further
monitoring of liver function is necessary.[79] determination of serum alt levels is recommended before starting treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  and then
at monthly intervals. if serum alt values remain
stable during the initial phase of treatment, the clinical setting can be used to ascertain the frequency
of subsequent monitoring.[46] preliminary data indicate that serum alt levels may have to be monitored frequently in patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx 
in combination with hepatotoxic dmards such as
methotrexate.[51] on the other hand, if serum alt
levels are >2-fold greater than the uln, the dosage
should be decreased to 10 mg/day. if continued
treatment with  xxxd2450xxx  is desired in patients in
whom serum alt levels are >2-fold and ≤3-fold
greater than the uln despite dosage reduction, it
is recommended that a liver biopsy be performed.
if serum alt levels remain elevated (>3-fold

greater than uln) despite a reduction in dosage
and treatment with  xxxd1684xxx  24g in 3 divided
doses over 24 hours, the drug should be withdrawn.
treatment with  xxxd1684xxx  may be repeated to
hasten drug elimination.[46]
7. place of  xxxd2450xxx  in the
management of adult patients
with active rheumatoid arthritis
rheumatoid arthritis, which affects approximately 0.5 to 1% of the population,[80] is the most
common form of inflammatory arthritis.[81] according to the 1987 revised american rheumatism
association criteria for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis, a patient is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis if 4 of the following 7 criteria are
present:[82] morning stiffness in and around the
joints lasting for at least 1 hour before maximal
improvement; arthritis of ≥3 joint areas; arthritis of
at least one joint area in the hands; simultaneous
arthritic involvement of the same joint areas on
both sides of the body; subcutaneous rheumatic
nodules over bony prominences, external surfaces,
or in juxta-articular regions; presence of serum
rheumatoid factor; radiographic erosions or unequivocal bony decalcification of the hands and/or
wrist joints.
the disease follows a progressive course and
structural joint damage occurs early after the onset
of symptoms. a recent trial reported joint erosions,
using magnetic resonance imaging, in 45% of patients within 4 months of the onset of symptoms.[83]
the majority of patients (≈75%) develop joint
damage within 2 years of disease onset, and maximum progression of radiographic erosion and joint
space narrowing occurs within the first few
years.[84,85] in addition to significant pain, fatigue,
disability, functional loss and psychological and
social effects,[80] patients with rheumatoid arthritis
have higher mortality rates than age- and gendermatched controls without the disease.[84] it has
been estimated that the 5-year survival rate is ≈50%
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which is similar to that in patients with 3-vessel coronary artery
disease or stage iv hodgkin’s disease.[86]
drugs 1999 dec; 58 (6)

 xxxd2450xxx : a review

1159

there is no pharmacological cure for rheumatoid arthritis and the goal of therapy is to achieve
complete remission, defined by the absence of
symptoms of active inflammatory joint pain, morning stiffness, fatigue, synovitis on joint examination, progression on radiographic joint damage and
elevation of esr or crp levels.[66] however, this
goal is seldom achieved with any of the available
treatments, and the alternative goals of management include:[66]
• control of disease activity
• alleviation of pain
• maintenance of function for essential activities
of daily living and work
• maximisation of quality of life
• slowing the rate of joint damage.
treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis
is usually initiated with nsaids to reduce joint
pain and swelling and improve function.[66] treatment with dmards should be initiated within 3
months in patients with an established diagnosis
who have persistent joint pain, significant morning
stiffness or fatigue, active synovitis, or elevation of
esr or crp levels, in spite of receiving treatment
with the recommended dosages of nsaids.[66]
the selection of a dmard for initiation of therapy depends on the convenience and cost of medication, monitoring for toxicity, risk of adverse

events including frequency and severity and the
physicians’ estimate of efficacy and disease prognosis.[66]
a summary of the relative efficacy and toxicity
of older dmards used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and their associated toxicities requiring monitoring, is presented in table v. adverse events are a major limitation in the use of
all dmards and monitoring of complete blood
counts with or without platelet counts is recommended in all patients receiving dmards (except
in those receiving  xxxd2301xxx ). additional monitoring of serum creatinine estimations
and liver function tests are recommended in patients receiving methotrexate or cyclosporin, and
of urine proteins in patients receiving oral or intramuscular gold or  xxxd2870xxx  (table v). the
cost of adverse event monitoring adds significantly
to the substantial direct cost of rheumatoid arthritis.[80]
among the older dmards, methotrexate appears to have the best efficacy/toxicity ratio,[87] although its use has been associated with rare but
potentially lethal adverse events such as hepatic
fibrosis and cirrhosis, interstitial pneumonitis and
myelosuppression.[78] furthermore, a recent review has indicated an association between the use
of methotrexate and the occurrence of lymphomas

in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.[76] therefore,
methotrexate is currently indicated in patients with
severe, acute disease who either do not respond to,
or are intolerant of, conventional therapy.[89]  xxxd3255xxx , on the other hand, appears to be nearly
as effective as methotrexate but is generally not as
well tolerated.[87] the haematological adverse
events of  xxxd3255xxx , which include neutropenia,
leucopenia and agranulocytosis, may be severe and
potentially fatal in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.[62] other dmards are generally less efficacious or more toxic than methotrexate or  xxxd3255xxx , and drugs such as  xxxd1665xxx ,
cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin are reserved
for patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis or
those with severe extra-articular complications of
the disease.[66] the anti- xxxg2296xxx 
(tnf) preparation, etanercept, is currently only indicated in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis.[90] the drawbacks with etanercept are that
it is expensive (with a monthly acquisition cost of
$us800[91] to 1100[92]) and inconvenient to administer (subcutaneous injections administered 2 times
weekly[93]). finally, the intravenously administered chimeric (mouse/ human) monoclonal antibody to tnf-alpha, infliximab, is being evaluated in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis but has not yet
been approved in this indication.[94]
 xxxd2450xxx  is a prodrug and its active metabolite, a77 1726 is a dmard that inhibits cell proliferation in activated lymphocytes. at 4 weeks,
once daily oral  xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day (after an
oral loading dose of 100mg once daily for 3 days)
provided significantly greater improvement than
placebo in all primary outcome measures, such as
tender joint count, swollen joint count and physicians’ and patients’ global assessments, in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.  xxxd2450xxx  appeared to have a quicker onset of action than
 xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate in comparative trials.
at end-point,  xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day was as effective as  xxxd3255xxx  2 g/day or methotrexate 7.5
to 15 mg/week for durations of up to 24 months
in 3 randomised, double-blind multicentre trials in
adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. im© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

provements from baseline in all primary outcome
measures with  xxxd2450xxx  were similar to those
with  xxxd3255xxx  and significantly greater than
with placebo. after 12 months, methotrexate was
significantly more effective than  xxxd2450xxx  in 1
trial, but no difference was evident between the 2
treatment groups in another trial. furthermore,
after 24 months the response rate according to
the acr 20 criteria and the improvement from
baseline values in 2 of the 4 primary efficacy parameters were similar between methotrexate- and
 xxxd2450xxx -treated patients.
compared with pretreatment values, reductions
in functional disability and improvement in hrqol
at end-point with  xxxd2450xxx  were significantly
greater than those with placebo,  xxxd3255xxx  or
methotrexate.  xxxd2450xxx  was significantly more
effective than placebo, and at least as effective as
 xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate, in delaying the rate
of radiological progression of the disease.
whereas rheumatologists often use combinations of dmards to treat patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, further trials are required to establish
the role of  xxxd2450xxx  in combination with other
agents. results from a small noncomparative trial
indicate that the addition of oral  xxxd2450xxx  10 to
20 mg/day may be effective in some patients with
refractory rheumatoid arthritis receiving methotrexate (mean dose 17.2 mg/week). on the other
hand, the synergistic effects of  xxxd2450xxx  plus
cyclosporin in an animal model of arthritis suggest
that this may be a potentially effective combination
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but trials in
patients are required to confirm this hypothesis.
the tolerability of oral  xxxd2450xxx  20 mg/day
was similar to that of  xxxd3255xxx  2 g/day or methotrexate 7.5 to 15 mg/week in comparative trials
lasting for up to 24 months. diarrhoea, respiratory
infections, nausea, headache, rash, abnormal liver
enzymes, dyspepsia and alopecia were the most
common adverse events reported with  xxxd2450xxx . the incidence and severity of elevation of serum hepatic enzymes in patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx  were similar to that with  xxxd3255xxx  or
methotrexate, and liver function should be monidrugs 1999 dec; 58 (6)

 xxxd2450xxx : a review

tored in patients receiving treatment with  xxxd2450xxx . like methotrexate,  xxxd2450xxx  is not recommended in female patients who are pregnant or
in those who are not using reliable contraception.
although the potential of  xxxd2450xxx  to cause
male-mediated fetotoxicity is uncertain, men wishing to father a child should discontinue the drug
and treatment with  xxxd1684xxx  or activated
charcoal should be considered to hasten drug elimination.
data from healthy volunteers indicate that  xxxd2450xxx  does not interact with, or affect the contraceptive efficacy of, triphasic oral contraceptive
pills, but the drug should be given with caution in
patients receiving rifampicin. whereas in vitro
studies suggest that there is potential for drug interactions between  xxxd2450xxx  and nsaids, such
as diclofenac and ibuprofen, no clinically relevant
interactions were observed in clinical trials in patients receiving  xxxd2450xxx  with nsaids.
although the incidence of serious adverse
events in  xxxd2450xxx  recipients was slightly less
than that in patients receiving  xxxd3255xxx  or
methotrexate in 2 trials, available data does not
permit any firm conclusions in this regard. the risk
of infections, lymphoproliferative disorders and
malignancy did not appear to be increased in
 xxxd2450xxx  recipients in clinical trials, but long
term data in greater numbers of patients are needed
to confirm this.
in conclusion,  xxxd2450xxx  is a dmard which
reduces the signs and symptoms of inflammatory
arthritis and delays the radiological progression of
disease in adult patients with active rheumatoid
arthritis. the drug appears to be as effective and
well tolerated as  xxxd3255xxx  or methotrexate, and
represents a suitable alternative to these agents in
adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.
