abstract
the effect of the r(-) and s(+) isomers of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (mda) and its n-methyl analog 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma) on [3h]inositol monophosphate accumulation was studied in cells expressing either 5-ht2a or 5-ht2c
receptors. the isomers of mda produced a concentration dependent increase in phosphotidyl inositol (pi) hydrolysis at the 5-ht2a
receptors, with the r(-) isomer of mda being more potent than the s(+) at the  xxxg1113xxx . the r(-) and s(+) isomers of
mdma were significantly less efficacious at the  xxxg1113xxx  as compared to mda; s(+)mdma had no effect. at the 5-ht2c
receptor, both r(-) and s(+)mda were equipotent at stimulating pi hydrolysis, with the s(+) isomer of mdma being more
efficacious at the 5-hyzc receptor compared with the r(-) isomer. in all cases at both the 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors, the affinities
of the isomers of mdma and mda were at least 2-3 orders of magnitude less than 5-ht. despite the weak effect of these
compounds at the 5-ht~a and 5-ht2c receptors, these substituted amphetamines do possess intrinsic activity which may contribute
to their neurotoxic effects when administered at high doses.
key words." 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (m da); 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (m dma): phosphotidyl inositol (p1);
serotonin (5-ht); 5-ht2a(formerly 5-ht2) and 5-ht2c (formerly 5-ht~c) receptors

the most frequently reported effect of 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  ( m d m a ) is the long-term depletion of brain serotonin (5-ht) content produced after
single or repeated high dose administration to rats or
nonhuman primates (for review see [8]). the mechanism
by which m d m a produces this 5-ht neurotoxicity is
unknown. recent studies investigating the pharmacological and toxicological effects of m d m a are suggestive
that the mechanism of action of m d m a is mediated, in
part, by 5-ht2a/2c receptors. for example, administration of m d m a produces a dose-dependent increase in
corticosterone secretion and body temperature, that is
blocked by 5-ht2a/2c antagonists [20,28]. likewise,

mdma-induced increase in the activity of  xxxg2276xxx  and the release of dopamine (da) in the striatum is attenuated by 5-ht~a/2c antagonists [18,21,29].
moreover, treatment with 5-ht2a/2c antagonists attenuates the long-term 5-ht depleting effect of m d m a in
the brain [18,21,27]. therefore, determination of the interaction of m d m a and the 5-ht, receptor subtypes
should advance the understanding of the mechanism(s)
of action of m d m a and related amphetamine derivatives.
the pharmacological effects of m d m a and mda are
believed to be mediated primarily by the release of 5-ht
[24] and inhibition of reuptake [30], resulting in a net
increase in serotonergic activity. for example, depletion
of brain 5-ht content has been reported to attenuate the
physiological and behavioral effects of m d m a [4,20]. in
addition to the effects on serotonergic systems, m d a
and m d m a are believed to increase the release and

inhibit the reuptake of dopamine (da) and norepinephrine [14,15,17,19,30]. thus, like amphetamine, mda
and m d m a are believed to act primarily as indirect
agonists via their ability to release and inhibit reuptake
of neurotransmitters from the axon terminal.
the direct interaction between mda or m d m a and
5-ht receptor(s) has received little attention because of
the aforementioned evidence linking their physiological
response to neurotransmitter release. however, administration of a single, high dose of [3h[mda or
[3h]mdma results in micromolar concentrations of
these compounds in multiple brain regions even up to
6 h after dosing [3]. the affinity of the r(-) and s(+)
isomers of mda and m d m a has been reported to be
in the low micromolar range for 5-ht2a receptors, based
on in vitro receptor binding studies [2,16]. thus, the
micromolar affinity of mda and m d m a might be expected to be pharmacologically and/or toxicologically
relevant after high dose administration of these compounds. aside from these receptor binding studies, issues
regarding the potency and efficacy of m d m a at different  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes have not been addressed.
in the present study, the effect of the r(-) and s(+)
isomers of mda and m d m a on [3h]inositol monophosphate accumulation in cells expressing the 5-ht2a
or 5-ht2c receptors was investigated to determine the
selectivity and efficacy of these compounds at 5-ht receptor subtypes.
the r(-) and s(+) isomers of m d m a and mda were
synthesized by dr. david nichols. the drugs were dis-

solved in a small volume of water and diluted with krebs
bicarbonate buffer to achieve the desired concentrations.
the krebs bicarbonate buffer was composed of (mm):
 xxxg2020xxx , 118: kc1, 4.7:cac12, 1.2: mgc12, 1.2: nahco3,
25: and glucose, 11, and equilibrated with 9 5 % 0 2 • 5 %
co> prior to use. the studies were conducted in a9 cells
which selectively express the cloned 5-htec receptor and
in 3t3 cells which express the cloned  xxxg1113xxx :
both a9 and 3t3 are fibroblast cell lines and have been
described in detail elsewhere [5,6]. the cells were harvested by trypsinization and split into 24 well plates with
complete medium (i.e., 10% fetal calf serum, dulbecco's
modified eagles medium) for 24 h. the cells were then
washed with inositol-free dmem 24 h later and then
incubated for an additional 18 h with inositol-free
dmem containing 1 /~ci/ml [3h]inositol (spec. act. 16
ci/mmol, nen, boston, ma) and 10% dialyzed fetal
calf serum. alter this incubation, the cells were rinsed
three times with krebs bicarbonate buffer. the cells were
then incubated 10 rain with 10 mm lic1 and then an
additional 60 rain with the test compounds. after aspiration of the buffer, the reaction was terminated by the
addition of 1.2 ml of methanol/water/hc1 (25:25:0.1).
the cells were harvested into glass tubes and 0.6 ml of
chloroform was added, followed by vigorous vortexing.
after phase separation, an aliquot (0.9 ml) of the upper
aqueous phase was removed and applied to 1 ml of
dowex ag 1x8 (formate form) resin packed in a disposable column. the [3h]inositol monophosphate was
eluted as described elsewhere [26].
the effect of r ( - ) and s(+) mda and m d m a on the
percent maximum stimulation of [3h]inositol monophosphate accumulation in cells expressing the 5-ht2a
or 5-ht_,c receptors is illustrated in figs. 1 and 2, respectively. the results are presented as the percent maximal

gorithm) and are presented in table 1. both isomers of
mda were as effective as 5-ht in stimulating pi hydrolysis at the  xxxg1113xxx  (fig. 1). the affinity of the
r(-) isomer was about 3 times that for the s(+) isomer
at this receptor (table 1). the r(-) isomer of mdma
produced a response which was 20% of that produced by
5-ht (10 -5 m) and the s(+) isomer of mdma was
completely inactive at the  xxxg1113xxx  (fig. 1). at
the  xxxg1115xxx , the r(-) and s(+) isomers of mda
produced identical concentration-response curves that
were approximately 60% of the response produced by
5-ht (fig. 2). the s(+) isomer of mdma produced a
60% maximal stimulation at the  xxxg1115xxx 
whereas the r(-) isomer produced a response (i.e., 30%
maximal stimulation) which mirrored its effect at the
 xxxg1113xxx  (fig. 1). at either 5-ht receptor subtype, the isomers of mda and mdma were 2-3 orders
of magnitude less potent than 5-ht (table 1).
these data are suggestive that both mda and
mdma possess stereoselective intrinsic activity at
5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors as full or partial agonists.
although the primary pharmacological effects of these
substituted amphetamines are mediated most likely by
indirect mechanism(s), viz. neurotransmitter release, the
direct agonist properties of these compounds may be
important in the neurotoxicological effects observed
after high dose administration.
the assertion that a direct 5-ht agonist effect of
mdma may play an important role in the neurotoxic
effects of this compound is based on the following evidence. microdialysis studies have found that the increase
in 5-ht release produced after administration of a single, high dose of mdma (20 mg/kg) reaches a maximum
within 30-60 min after administration and declines
thereafter approaching baseline values within 120-150
min. [1,12]. however, a number of physiological measures such as locomotor activation, hyperthermia and
hormone secretion, which are believed to be mediated by
5-ht, remain stimulated for 3-4 hours after high dose
mdma administration [4,11,20,21]. thus, the time
course for increased extracellular concentrations of
5-ht and the resultant physiological responses after administration of mdma do not correlate. therefore, it
is conceivable that some direct agonist effect may contribute to the prolonged physiological responses produced by mdma.
based on the micromolar affinity of mda and
mdma for stimulating pi hydrolysis at the 5-ht2a/2c
receptors, high concentrations of these compounds
would need to be present at the site of action in order to
have an effect. one factor that likely contributes to
achieving high brain concentrations of these compounds
is the 3,4-methylenedioxy substituent on the phenyl ring.
it is well-recognized that substitutions at the 3 and 4
positions of the phenylalkyl structure decrease the metabolic conversion of this structure resulting in an increase

in the biological half-life of the parent compound [22].
in the case of mda and mdma, the 3,4-methylenedioxy substitution blocks an important metabolic pathway
(i.e., para hydroxylation) which prolongs the presence of
these drugs in the brain. moreover, in tile case of
mdma, another route of metabolism is n-demethylation which results in the formation of mda [7,13].
therefore, it can be envisioned that high dose administration of mdma results in micromolar brain concentrations of the drug [3] some portion of which is stereoselectively metabolized to an active metabolite, mda,
both of which have a direct effect on 5-ht receptors.
finally, drug discrimination studies in which rats are
trained to distinguish between an hallucinogen and saline
are suggestive that, in the case of mda, the r(-) isomer
produces a 'hallucinogenic' cue, consistent with the
human experience [9,10,23]. in contrast, the s(+) isomer
of either mda or mdma produces a cue that appears
to be mediated by indirect release of endogenous neurotransmitters [9,10,22]. interestingly, the s(+) isomer of
mdma is the active isomer in humans [23] and the most
neurotoxic at high doses [8]. the results obtained in the
present study are suggestive that the r(-) isomer has a
greater affinity and intrinsic efficacy at the  xxxg1113xxx  compared with results obtained at the 5-htzc. more
importantly, the s(+) isomer of mdma has a selective
effect at the  xxxg1115xxx . thus, based on these data,
it is hypothesized that the  xxxg1115xxx  is directly
stimulated by mdma after high, neurotoxic doses.
mda and mdma have low affinity and moderate
intrinsic efficacy at 5-ht receptors. the s(+) isomer of

mdma is selectively active at the  xxxg1115xxx . it is
conceivable that after high dose administration, mdma
can interact directly with 5-ht receptors contributing to
the prolonged effect on multiple physiological parameters. since previously our laboratory has found that
mdma stimulates dopaminergic pathways in the nigrostriatal pathways after high neurotoxic doses, it is hypothesized that mdma, both directly and indirectly via
5-ht release, activates these pathways via 5-ht2c receptors and results in the prolonged and excessive increase
in da release in brain regions innervated by this pathway. the ability of mdma to interact directly with the
 xxxg1115xxx  may contribute to this prolonged effect
and the resultant neurotoxicity.
