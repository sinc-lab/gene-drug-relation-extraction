the mechanism of action of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), as well the side effects, are explained by inhibition of prostaglandin (pg) synthesis by cyclooxygenase (cox) (vane, 1971). the recent finding of a
second cox isoform (cox-2) provided the basis for the discovery of anti-inflammatory drugs with improved safety.
cox-1 is expressed in most tissues and cells and is abundant
in the gi tract, kidney, and platelets. prostaglandins formed
by this enzyme are important for normal physiological function in these tissues. the second isoform, cox-2, is prominently expressed in inflamed tissues, where it produces

for  xxxd2069xxx ). the overall saturation binding affinity for cox-2
of  xxxd3481xxx  is 2.6 nm (compared with 1.6 nm for celecoxib,
51 nm for rofecoxib, and 260 nm for  xxxd2069xxx ), with a slow
off-rate (t1/2 ⬃98 min).  xxxd3481xxx  inhibits cox-1 in a competitive fashion only at very high concentrations (ic50 ⫽ 150 ␮m).
collectively, these data provide a mechanistic basis for the
potency and in vitro selectivity of  xxxd3481xxx  for cox-2.  xxxd3481xxx  showed similar activity in the human whole-blood cox
assay (cox-2 ic50 ⫽ 0.24 ␮m; cox-1 ic50 ⫽ 21.9 ␮m). we also
determined whether this in vitro potency and selectivity translated to significant potency in vivo. in rats,  xxxd3481xxx  demonstrated marked potency in acute and chronic models of inflammation (air pouch ed50 ⫽ 0.06 mg/kg; paw edema ed50 ⫽ 5.9
mg/kg; adjuvant arthritis ed50 ⫽ 0.03 mg/kg). in these same
animals, cox-1 was spared at doses greater than 200 mg/kg.
these data provide a basis for the observed potent anti-inflammatory activity of  xxxd3481xxx  in humans.

a lesser extent constitutively expressed in brain and kidney

enzyme may achieve anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy without affecting production of physiological pgs
(needleman and isakson, 1997).
testing schemes were developed that relied on assessing
the ability of compounds to selectively inhibit cox-2 over
cox-1. initially, cells were utilized that expressed the proper

fibroblasts for cox-2 or platelets for cox-1]. purified ovine

abstract
the discovery of a second isoform of cyclooxygenase (cox)
led to the search for compounds that could selectively inhibit
cox-2 in humans while sparing prostaglandin formation from
cox-1. celecoxib and rofecoxib were among the molecules
developed from these efforts. we report here the pharmacological properties of a third selective cox-2 inhibitor,  xxxd3481xxx , which is the most potent and in vitro selective of the
marketed cox-2 inhibitors that we have studied. recombinant
human cox-1 and cox-2 were used to screen for new highly
potent and in vitro selective cox-2 inhibitors and compare
kinetic mechanisms of binding and enzyme inhibition with other
cox inhibitors.  xxxd3481xxx  potently inhibits recombinant
cox-2, with an ic50 of 0.005 ␮m; this compares with ic50
values of 0.05 ␮m for celecoxib, 0.5 ␮m for rofecoxib, and 5 ␮m
for  xxxd2069xxx . unique binding interactions of  xxxd3481xxx  with
cox-2 translate into a fast rate of inactivation of cox-2
(110,000 m/s compared with 7000 m/s for rofecoxib and 80 m/s

materials and methods
materials
 xxxd208xxx , supplied as the sodium salt, was obtained from
nuchek prep (elysian, mn); pge2 and thromboxane b2 (txb2) elisa
kits were obtained from cayman chemical (ann arbor, mi); celecoxib,
 xxxd3481xxx , rofecoxib,  xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , and sc-560 [5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-trifluoromethylpyrazole] were all prepared by the amersham biosciences inc. medicinal chemistry department (piscataway, nj); indomethacin, naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac,
 xxxd2065xxx ,  xxxd2688xxx ,  xxxd2969xxx , and all standard buffer reagents were
obtained from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo).

in vitro potency and selectivity
human recombinant enzyme assay. compounds were evaluated for selectivity of inhibition in vitro using baculovirus-expressed
recombinant human cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes as previously described (gierse et al., 1995). for cox-2-selective inhibitors, ic50s were
generated from a mean of at least four separate determinations, and
nsaids for comparison purposes only were tested once. inactivation
rate constants were determined as previously described (walker et al.,

fig. 1. cox-2-selective inhibitors used in the current study.

2001) by measuring oxygen consumption directly with a clark-style
polarographic electrode. in addition, kinetic constants were determined
by measuring the cyclooxygenase activity indirectly by utilizing tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine as a cosubstrate with  xxxd208xxx  by
the method previously described (gierse et al., 1999).
radioligand binding assay. a direct binding assay that measures
radiolabeled inhibitor binding to enzyme was developed to assess binding directly to cox-1 and cox-2 without the confounding influence of
enzyme kinetics. the method is described in detail by hood et al. (2003)
and is summarized here. cox-1- or cox-2-specific monoclonal antibodies  xxxd1891xxx  ␮g/ml in 100 mm nahco3, ph 8.2 were coated (100 ␮l/well)
onto 96-well immulon-2 microtiter plates (dynex technologies inc.,
chantilly, va) and incubated overnight at room temperature in a humidified chamber. the coated plates were washed with dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (d-pbs; invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), without cacl2
and mgcl2, ph 7.4 and then treated with a blocking reagent consisting
of 10% skim milk in d-pbs (0.2 ml) for 90 to 120 min at 37°c to decrease
nonspecific binding to the plate. the coated and blocked plates were
washed, cox enzyme was added at 20 to 35 ␮g/ml in 50 ␮l of binding
buffer (100 mm tris and 1 ␮m hemin, ph 8.0), and then was incubated
at room temperature for 60 to 120 min. finally, these antibody-captured enzyme-coated plates were washed with d-pbs and aspirated to
dryness immediately prior to the binding assay. to determine competitive binding with  xxxd3481xxx , various concentrations of the indicated
compound were incubated with [3h] xxxd3481xxx  and allowed to compete
for the binding to cox-2 for 120 min. ki values were determined from
logit-log transformations of the binding data. for determination of
dissociation rates, 3h compounds were incubated with murine cox-2
immobilized on a 96-well plate for 120 min before excess cold inhibitor
(10 ␮m) was added to initiate the dissociation time course. at the
indicated times, the incubation was halted by aspiration, and the remaining radiolabeled inhibitor was released from the enzyme and
counted. specific binding of  xxxd3481xxx  was 93%, celecoxib was 73%, and
rofecoxib was 50%.
cox inhibition in human whole blood. the assay of patrignani et al. (1994) was used to assess cox inhibition in human whole
blood. for cox-2-selective inhibitors, ic50s were generated from a
mean of at least five separate determinations, and nsaids for comparison purposes only were tested once. to evaluate cox-1-mediated txb2 production, venous blood from healthy human donors was
collected in tubes without anticoagulants and allowed to clot. blood

pressed in mammalian cells (meade et al., 1993) or expressed
in insect cells and purified (barnett et al., 1994; gierse et al.,
1995), were utilized in screening assays. these in vitro assays provided a powerful means for assessing cox selectivity
and potency and led to the discovery and clinical development of the first rationally designed cox-2-selective inhibitors, celecoxib (penning et al., 1997) and rofecoxib (black et
al., 1999; chan et al., 1999).
recombinant enzymes have been useful for defining the
kinetic mechanism of cox-2-selective inhibition and for
structural studies of the molecular basis underlying this
phenomenon. the results of these mechanistic experiments
indicated that cox-2-selective inhibitors such as celecoxib
weakly inhibit cox-1 in a competitive fashion but potently
inhibit cox-2 through a time-dependent, slowly reversible
mechanism (gierse et al., 1999). the potent and specific
time-dependent mechanism confers selectivity for cox-2
(copeland et al., 1994; gierse et al., 1995; ouellet and percival, 1995). the specificity for cox-2 demonstrated by diaryl heterocyclic inhibitors such as celecoxib is based on their
interaction with a unique side pocket in the cox-2 active site
(kurumbail et al., 1996); a single amino acid difference
within the catalytic sites of the two isoforms provides a major
contribution to cox-2 specificity (gierse et al., 1996).
despite advances in understanding the molecular and kinetic bases for specificity, methods for evaluating in vitro
activity on cox isoforms vary widely, leading to considerable
differences in reported selectivity (meade et al., 1993; laneuville et al., 1994; smith et al., 1994, 1995, 1997; chan et al.,
1995; gierse et al., 1995; jouzeau et al., 1997). this suggests
the need for methods to clearly evaluate cox isoform specificity in vivo. the observation by masferrer et al. (1994) that
the inflamed rat air pouch produces pgs derived from
cox-2, whereas gastric pg levels mirror cox-1 activity,
suggests a means for directly evaluating selectivity in vivo.
in this report, we utilize in vitro and in vivo methodology to
assess cox isoform selectivity and describe the pharmacological activity of  xxxd3481xxx , a rationally designed cox-2
inhibitor (talley et al., 2000), as well as the other marketed
cox-2-selective inhibitors, celecoxib, rofecoxib (black et al.,
1999), and  xxxd2069xxx  (riendeau et al., 2001) (fig. 1).

(0.5 ml) was incubated in 96-well culture plates for 1 h at 37°c with
compound suspended in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso; 0.4% final concentration), and the mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37°c. the
reaction was stopped by cold centrifugation at 800g for 10 min at 4°c
to pellet the cells. the supernatants were recovered and diluted
1:200 in elisa buffer for quantitation of txb2 by elisa. expected
levels of txb2 formed in this assay are 50 to 100 ng/ml serum. twelve
concentrations of compound starting at 200 ␮m with 3-fold dilutions
were examined in duplicate.
to evaluate compounds for cox-2-mediated pge2 production,
venous blood from healthy human donors was collected in heparinized tubes. blood (0.5 ml) was incubated in 96-well collection plates
for 24 h at 37°c with 100 ␮g/ml lps (sigma l-2630; sigma-aldrich)
and compound dissolved in dmso (0.4% final concentration of
dmso). the reaction was stopped by cold centrifugation at 800g for
10 min at 4°c to pellet the cells. plasma supernatant (40 ␮l) was
precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol (160 ␮l) and spun at 800g
for 10 min. supernatants were recovered and diluted 1:50 in elisa
buffer for quantitation of pge2 by elisa. expected pge2 levels in
this assay are approximately 15 ng/ml for unstimulated and 50 to
150 ng/ml for simulated plasma. twelve concentrations of compound

in vivo potency and selectivity
rat air pouch model of inflammation. air pouches were produced by subcutaneous injection of 20 ml of sterile air into the
intrascapular area of the back of male lewis rats (175–200 g)
(charles river laboratories, inc., wilmington, ma), six animals per
dose group. pouches were allowed to develop for 1 day. animals were
fasted with free access to water. compounds or vehicle were administered by gavage 2 h prior to injection of 2 ml of a 1% suspension of
carrageenan (sigma-aldrich) dissolved in saline into the pouch. at
3 h postcarrageenan injection, the pouch fluid was collected by lavage with 1 ml of cold heparin-saline. the fluid was centrifuged at
800g for 10 min at 4°c, and the supernatants were collected for
analysis of pge2 by elisa. at the end of the 3-h postcarrageenan
injection, rats were anesthetized with a co2/o2 gas, and blood was
collected by heart stick. the gastrointestinal tract was exposed and
observed for lesions. sections of stomach mucosa were dissected and
immediately frozen for further prostaglandin analysis. frozen tissues
were processed by homogenization in 70% ethanol. after centrifugation,
the supernatants were collected, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and
resuspended in elisa buffer for pge2 determination by elisa.
acute carrageenan-induced edema and hyperalgesia in the
rat. paw edema was induced by injecting 0.1 ml of a 1% carrageenan
saline solution into the hind paw of male sprague-dawley rats (180 –
280 g), six animals per dose group. prior to experiments, the rats were
allowed free access to food and water. compounds or vehicle (0.5%
 xxxd2609xxx  in water) were administered orally 1 h before the carrageenan injection, and paw volume was measured by water displacement at intervals thereafter. analgesic activity was assessed as inhibition of hyperalgesia produced in response to a thermal stimulus from a
radiant heat source (high-intensity projector lamp bulb) positioned under a plexiglas floor directly beneath the hind paw. the withdrawal
latency of the affected paw was compared with the contralateral (i.e.,
normal) paw and determined to the nearest 0.1 s with an electronic
clock circuit and a microcomputer. each point represents either the
change in paw volume or withdrawal.
rat adjuvant arthritis model. dose-response curves for antiinflammatory activity were established as described by billingham
(1983). male lewis rats (180 –200 g), six animals per dose group,
were injected with 1 mg of heat-killed mycobacterium butyricum
(difco, detroit, mi) suspended in light  xxxd2648xxx  (1 mg/0.025 ml)
[subcutaneously in the plantar surface of the right hind paw (day 0)].

results
assessment of cox inhibition in vitro and in vivo.
inhibition of cox isoforms in vitro by  xxxd3481xxx  and several
nsaids was assessed using recombinant human enzymes
(table 1, left). consistent with previous reports, most
nsaids appear to nonselectively inhibit both isoforms of
cox.  xxxd3481xxx  and diclofenac are the most potent inhibitors
of cox-2 in this setting, exhibiting ic50 values of 0.005 and
0.01 ␮m, respectively. in contrast to the nsaids evaluated,
 xxxd3481xxx  demonstrates clear potency and selectivity for
cox-2, consistent with a previous report (talley et al., 2000).
in an effort to more fully characterize the potency of cox-2
enzyme inhibition, kinetic parameters for time-dependent
inhibition were determined (table 2). time-dependent parameters of ki and kinact obtained with  xxxd3481xxx  for cox-2
are 35 ␮m and 3.8 s for the oxygen uptake assay (table 2).
the efficiency of compound inhibition for cox-2 can be more
conveniently expressed as a function of the kinact/ki (seconds
per micromolar). when expressed in this manner,  xxxd3481xxx 
and celecoxib have a similar efficiency for cox-2 inhibition,
with  xxxd3481xxx  having a faster rate of inactivation (kinact).
consistent with the standard endpoint recombinant enzyme
assay, both rofecoxib and  xxxd2069xxx  were less potent, primarily due to their slow rate of inactivation of cox-2.
in the two-step model of cox-2 inhibition, potency is
largely due to time-dependent inhibition, where the forward

rate (kinact) is vastly greater than the off-rate (k⫺2) due to
tight binding. thus, the off-rate cannot be directly determined from enzyme kinetic measurements. to assess the
off-rate of inhibitors from cox-2, a binding assay was utilized that directly measures the kinetics of binding of radiolabeled compounds to cox-2. using this method, it was found
that  xxxd3481xxx  had a slow dissociation rate from cox-2 (t1/2 ⫽
98 min versus 50 min for celecoxib and 17 min for rofecoxib).
competitive binding kis were also determined using the binding assay; the rank order of potency for binding was similar to
that found with the enzyme inhibition assay, although quantitative differences in potency are apparent (table 3).
isoform specificity in human cells was also assessed using
the whole-blood assay of patrignani et al. (1994) as modified
by chan et al. (1995) (fig. 2; table 1, center). in this analysis,
some of the nsaids showed some selectivity for cox-2 (e.g.,
diclofenac and  xxxd2065xxx ). however, there are several anomalies evident in these data; naproxen and the active metabolite
of  xxxd2688xxx  were inactive on cox-2 despite their known
anti-inflammatory activity in humans, whereas drugs that exhibited specificity for cox-2, such as diclofenac and  xxxd2065xxx ,
are known to produce gi toxicity in patients with the same
incidence as other nsaids (physicians’ desk reference, 1998).
interestingly, only slight differences in potency for cox-2 inhibition were observed among the cox-2-selective inhibitors.
since in vitro measurements of cox isoform selectivity
may be unreliable predictors of in vivo activity, we directly
assessed the effect of various doses of several nsaids and
 xxxd3481xxx  on pg content in vivo derived from either cox-1
(gastric mucosa) or cox-2 (inflamed air pouch). this provided a quantitative biochemical assessment of the specificity of inhibition of cox isoforms in vivo. as shown in fig. 3,
 xxxd3481xxx  dose-dependently decreased inflammatory pge2
production, with ed50 occurring at approximately 0.06 mg/kg;
little inhibition of cox-1-derived gastric pg content was observed over a wide dose range. in contrast, nsaids showed no
specificity for either cox isoform ( xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2688xxx )
or apparent cox-1 specificity ( xxxd2065xxx ) in this in vivo assay.
quantitative comparisons of several nsaids derived from
dose-response analyses are shown in table 1, panel 3.
activity in acute inflammation and hyperalgesia. in
vivo potency and efficacy of  xxxd3481xxx  was evaluated in a standard model of acute inflammation and pain. the injection of
carrageenan into the rat paw caused marked increases in paw

preclinical pharmacological profile of  xxxd3481xxx 

within 1 to 3 h. prophylactic administration of either  xxxd3481xxx 
or naproxen produced sustained inhibition of edema and hyperalgesia (fig. 4). when administered prior to carrageenan injection,  xxxd3481xxx  was as efficacious as naproxen in blocking the
inflammatory pain response (table 4).
anti-inflammatory activity in adjuvant-induced arthritis. adjuvant-induced arthritis in lewis rats was used as
a model of chronic anti-inflammatory activity.  xxxd3481xxx 
exhibited potent activity in this assay (ed50 ⫽ 0.03 mg/kg)
(table 5). this was equivalent in maximal efficacy to the
standard nsaid indomethacin and the steroid dexamethasone, as seen from the comparison of the respective time
courses of treatment (fig. 5).

discussion

maximal effects seen with  xxxd3481xxx  in these studies are
similar to those produced by nsaids. reports describing
knockout animals, in which the cox-2 gene for has been
deleted (dinchuk et al., 1995; morham et al., 1995), along
with increasing awareness of physiological roles for cox-2,
have raised concern for adverse consequences of selective
cox-2 inhibition (richardson and emery, 1996). although
the studies described here were not designed to evaluate
adverse effects, the level of inhibition of cox-2 produced by
 xxxd3481xxx  in animal models is no different from that already
seen with drugs used extensively in patients.
it is believed that inhibition of pg synthesis by cox-1 is
pivotal to the production of gastrointestinal injury by
nsaids (mitchell et al., 1993; seibert et al., 1995). in addition to the minimal effects on gastric pgs,  xxxd3481xxx  produced no functional evidence of cox-1 inhibition in acute
models that screen for nsaid-type gi toxicity. the absence
of gastric or intestinal injury after single doses of  xxxd3481xxx 
in rodents (compared with indomethacin, which produced
clear gastric injury, peritonitis, and fibrosis in all animals)
suggests that  xxxd3481xxx  possesses lower potential for gi
toxicity than a nonselective inhibitor.
assays using human whole blood, which typically measure
cox-1 inhibition in platelets and inhibition of cox-2 induced in monocytes with lps, were developed to mitigate the
uncertainty of in vitro systems. however, as shown here,
these assays appear to suffer the same limitations seen with
in vitro assays. thus, inconsistencies noted between these
results (table 1) and the known clinical activity of several
drugs (e.g., diclofenac, naproxen,  xxxd2688xxx , and  xxxd2561xxx ) suggest that this approach does not necessarily predict
either selectivity or improved gi safety in humans.
in vivo assessments of cox-2 selectivity are ultimately more
relevant because they represent pharmacological activity in
whole animals. pgs measured in experimentally induced inflammatory exudate and gastric extracts provide simultaneous
measures of the activities of cox-2 and cox-1, respectively. in
vivo, all nsaids appear nonselective with little or no separation of dose-response curves for inhibition of inflammation and
gastric pgs. this is consistent with the well recognized toxicity
of these drugs in patients given ordinary clinical doses.
in conclusion, the exquisite anti-inflammatory potency of
 xxxd3481xxx  in vivo is due in large part to its ability to potently
inhibit cox-2. by in vitro measurements,  xxxd3481xxx  is a highly
potent cox-2 inhibitor. further enzyme kinetic analyses re-

evidence is presented here that  xxxd3481xxx  potently and
selectively inhibits cox-2 in vitro and in vivo and, in animals, possesses lower potential for inhibition of cox-1 as
well as anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity comparable
with nsaids. the evidence for potency and selectivity of
 xxxd3481xxx  in vitro was seen in the recombinant enzyme
assay and was maintained in the human whole-blood assay.
factors underlying the high potency of  xxxd3481xxx  for cox-2
were assessed mechanistically. consistent with previous studies, the primary kinetic factors underlying the potency and
cox-2 selectivity of  xxxd3481xxx  was time dependent inhibition
of cox-2 and not cox-1 (copeland et al., 1994). this was
manifested by a very rapid rate of inactivation (kinact) and
observed rate of inactivation (kobserved) of cox-2 by  xxxd3481xxx .
these results, coupled with the finding of a very slow off-rate of
binding, provide a mechanistic basis for the potency and specificity of  xxxd3481xxx  for cox-2. the in vitro potency and selectivity of  xxxd3481xxx  for cox-2 was confirmed in vivo, using
biochemical measures of cox activity. thus, dose-dependent
inhibition of pg formation at sites of inflammation was observed (ed50 ⫽ 0.03– 0.06 mg/kg) without significant effects on
cox-1-dependent pg production in the stomach (ed50 ⬎ 200
mg/kg). these data are significant because it is now recognized
that predictions of cox-2 selectivity based solely on in vitro
results are suspect (jouzeau et al., 1997) and require confirmation in vivo (meade et al., 1993).
as would be expected of a potent cox-2 inhibitor,  xxxd3481xxx  was as effective as indomethacin in both the acute
carrageenan inflammation model (ed50 ⬃6 mpk) and in the
adjuvant-induced arthritis model (ed50 ⬃0.03 mg/kg). the

and methods. maximum efficacy of  xxxd3481xxx

vealed that the potency of  xxxd3481xxx  for cox-2 is due to its fast
rate of inactivation of cox-2 and tightness of binding, manifested by a slow off-rate.  xxxd3481xxx ’s potency is maintained in
animal models of acute inflammation and pain without apparent effect on cox-1 at maximal doses administered.  xxxd3481xxx ’s efficacy in a chronic rat model of arthritis is reflective of its
low clinical dose. clinical evaluations of the effectiveness and
side effects of  xxxd3481xxx  have confirmed these conclusions.
