abstract
5-{4-[4-(5-cyano-3-indolyl)-butyl)-butyl]-1-piperazinyl}-benzofuran-2-carboxamide (emd 68843;  xxxd3509xxx ) is a novel compound with combined high affinity and selectivity for the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) transporter and 5-ht1a receptors. emd
68843 was tested as a prototype compound, which benefits
from dual pharmacological effects that could increase extracellular 5-ht to levels higher than those produced by conventional
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris). in sf9 cells,
emd 68843 increased guanosine 5⬘-o-(3-[35s]thiotriphosphate) binding to 69% of the magnitude of the full 5-ht1a
receptor agonist r-(1)-trans-8-hydroxy-2-[n-n-propyl-n-(39iodo-29-propenyl)] aminotetralin (8-oh-pipat), indicating that
it is a partial agonist at 5-ht1a receptors. acute, systemic
administration of emd 68843 produced a larger maximal increase of extracellular 5-ht than the ssri fluoxetine in both the
ventral hippocampus (hpv) (558 versus 274%) and the frontal
cortex (fc) (527 versus 165%). regional differences in the
response to the two drugs were also observed. these effects

may be attributed to the differential regulation of 5-ht release
in the hpv and fc by 5-ht1a autoreceptors. when challenged
with the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-oh-dpat), emd 68843-induced increases
in extracellular 5-ht were greatly reduced in the hpv but to a
lesser extent in the fc. in behavioral studies, emd 68843
produced antidepressant-like effects in the forced swimming
test in both rats and mice but only within a narrow dosage
range. like fluoxetine, emd 68843 did not produce the symptoms of the 5-ht behavioral syndrome in rats but, unlike fluoxetine, pretreatment with emd 68843 blocked expression of the
5-ht behavioral syndrome induced by 8-oh-dpat. taken together, the results show that emd 68843 augments extracellular 5-ht levels in forebrain regions to a greater extent than
fluoxetine. at higher doses, however, weak efficacy of emd
68843 at postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors may inhibit the expression of rodent antidepressant-like behaviors.

most widely prescribed class of antidepressant drugs because
they are clinically effective, elicit fewer aversive side effects,
and have an increased safety margin compared with other
antidepressants. ssris given acutely block the serotonin
transporter and increase extracellular levels of 5-ht in forebrain regions, including the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum (kreiss and lucki, 1995; invernizzi et al., 1996; romero
et al., 1996; hjorth et al., 2000). the ability of ssris to
increase serotonergic neurotransmission is believed to be an
important component of their clinical antidepressant activity

ssri and 5-ht1a ligand augments 5-ht neurotransmission

inhibiting 5-ht reuptake and regulating 5-ht1a receptors.
the effects of emd 68843 were compared with the ssri
fluoxetine on extracellular 5-ht levels in the ventral hippocampus (hpv) and the frontal cortex (fc) after acute,
systemic administration using in vivo microdialysis. additional studies were done to characterize the effects of emd
68843 on responses mediated by 5-ht1a receptors. for example, the effects of emd 68843 were examined in the forced
swimming test (fst), a behavioral test in rats and mice used
to predict antidepressant potential (borsini and meli, 1988;
lucki, 1997). also, the efficacy of emd 68843 to activate
postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors was evaluated in vitro by examining its ability to promote binding of [35s]gtp␥s to g
proteins expressed in sf9 cells efficacy (butkerait et al., 1995;
barr and manning, 1997) and in vivo by observing the appearance of the 5-ht behavioral syndrome (lucki, 1992).

materials and methods
animals. male sprague-dawley rats (charles river laboratories,
wilmington, ma) weighing 175 to 200 g at the start of the experiment were housed two per cage and maintained under conditions of
constant temperature (22°c) on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle (7:00 am
on and 7:00 pm off) with free access to food and water. animal
procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines published in the national institutes of health guide for care and use of
laboratory animals, and all protocols were approved by the university of pennsylvania institutional animal care and use committee.
after an acclimation period of approximately 1 week, rats were
implanted with a stainless steel-guide cannula directed at either the
ventral hippocampus or the frontal cortex using the following coordinates (paxinos and watson, 1986) from bregma, midline, and dura
using a kopf stereotaxic instrument: anterior-posterior ⫺5.6 mm,
mediolateral 4.7 mm, and dorsal-ventral ⫺4.4 mm (hpv), and anterior-posterior ⫹3.2 mm, mediolateral 0.7 mm, and dorsal-ventral
⫺2.5 mm (fc). cannulae were secured to the skull with cranioplastic
cement and skull screws. rats were housed individually for approximately 1 week following surgery and handled on at least 4 days
prior to microdialysis experiments. the day before an experiment,
microdialysis probes were lowered into the hpv or the fc, and rats
were placed in a cylindrical plexiglas container lined with bedding
material and attached to a liquid swivel by a spring tether. the
probes were continuously perfused with an artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (acsf) solution (147 mm nacl, 1.7 mm cacl2, 0.9 mm mgcl2,
and 4 mm kcl) at a flow rate of 0.8 ␮l/min. baseline sample collection began the following morning. rats received an injection of fluoxetine, emd 68843, or vehicle (2 ml/kg, i.p.) after 2 h of baseline
sampling. extracellular levels of 5-ht in response to drug injection
were measured for 3 h after injection. at the end of the experiment,
the probe location was marked by infusion of green food coloring
through the dialysis probe. brains were removed and subsequently
sectioned for histological verification of correct probe placement.
microdialysis probe construction. vertical, concentric microdialysis probes were constructed as previously described (kreiss and
lucki, 1997). a plastic screw cap secured the probe into the guide
cannula on the day of the experiment. in vitro recovery rates for
dialysis probes were determined by placing them in an eppendorf
tube filled with acsf. the acsf was continually perfused through
the probe at a rate of 0.8 ␮l/min. after a known concentration of 5-ht
standard was added to the bath, the concentration of 5-ht in the
perfusate was compared with the amount in the bath. the reported
values for 5-ht in dialysate samples are corrected for recovery for
archival purposes. the mean recovery rate was 24 ⫾ 1.2%.
dialysate analysis. the amount of 5-ht in dialysates was determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. briefly, 12-␮l samples were injected directly onto

(heninger et al., 1996). as with other antidepressants, however, repeated administration and a substantial latency are
required before therapeutic effects are typically observed,
and the reasons for this are not clearly understood. it is thought
that repeated administration of ssris may lead to a net augmentation of 5-ht transmission, at least in part, by desensitizing presynaptic inhibitory 5-ht autoreceptors, either somatodendritic 5-ht1a receptors or 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors
located on nerve terminals (chaput et al., 1986; blier et al.,
1987; kreiss and lucki, 1995; invernizzi et al., 1996).
based in part on this framework, recent in vivo microdialysis and electrophysiology experiments have shown that
administration of  xxxg1108xxx  antagonists augment the
effects of ssris on extracellular 5-ht (for review, see artigas
et al., 1996; hjorth et al., 2000). this framework has also
served as the basis for the development of clinical treatment
strategies for either inducing a more rapid onset of clinical
effects or for potentially managing treatment-resistant patients (for review, see mcaskill et al., 1998; cryan and leonard, 2000; nelson, 2000). for example, the combined administration of  xxxd2957xxx , a mixed 5-ht1a/␤-adrenergic receptor
partial agonist, with ssris has been shown to enhance the
increase of extracellular levels of 5-ht in preclinical studies
(romero et al., 1996) and produce a more rapid onset of
clinical antidepressant effects (blier and bergeron, 1997;
perez et al., 1997), although not all clinical trials with this
drug combination have been positive (berman et al., 1997).
serotonergic projections throughout the forebrain arise primarily from two main cell body groups, the dorsal raphe (dr)
and median raphe (mr) nuclei (kosofsky and molliver, 1987).
regions innervated by the dr (e.g., striatum and frontal cortex)
have been shown to be more responsive to regulation by the
5-ht1a autoreceptor than regions innervated by the mr (e.g.,
dorsal and ventral hippocampus) (sinton and fallon, 1988;
hjorth and sharp, 1991; malagie et al., 1996; invernizzi et al.,
1997; romero and artigas, 1997; knobelman et al., 2001).
the present studies examined in vivo pharmacological responses evoked by the novel compound emd 68843 (also
known as sb659746-a or  xxxd3509xxx ) because of its dual
activity at 5-ht transporters and 5-ht1a receptors. like
ssris, emd 68843 is a potent inhibitor of the reuptake of
5-ht with an ic50 value of 0.2 nm (bartoszyk et al., 1997),
which is about 300-fold more selective at inhibiting 5-ht
than norepinephrine reuptake (c. seyfried, merck, unpublished data). unlike the prototypic ssri fluoxetine, however,
emd 68843 exhibits high affinity for the  xxxg1108xxx 
(ic50 ⫽ 0.5 nm) (bartoszyk et al., 1997) and negligible affinity for other 5-ht receptors ( xxxg1110xxx , 5-ht2a, and 5-ht2c
receptors; c. seyfried, merck, unpublished data). although
its efficacy for activating 5-ht1a receptors was not previously determined, in vitro assays demonstrated a decrease in
5-ht release, indicating activation of presynaptic 5-ht1a
receptors (merck, unpublished data). initial behavioral studies showed that emd 68843 (55 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited ultrasonic vocalizations in rats, a behavioral model for anxiolytic
effects produced by activation of presynaptic 5-ht1a receptors. the absence of effects on core body temperature of rats
was suggested to indicate that emd 68843 lacked intrinsic
activity at postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors (bartoszyk et al.,
1997). the goal of the present study was to examine the
effects of emd 68843 on extracellular 5-ht levels as a prototype compound expected to demonstrate mixed activity at

5-ht behavioral syndrome. rats were observed for 15 min for
the appearance of the 5-ht behavioral syndrome immediately after
the administration of 8-oh-dpat (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or emd 68843
(3.0 mg/kg, i.p). varying doses of emd 68843 (0.3–3.0 mg/kg i.p.)
were also administered 15 min prior to a challenge dose of 8-ohdpat (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) to determine whether emd 68843 could block
the 5-ht syndrome. the rats were observed in individual polycarbonate cages with the floor covered with bedding material. the cage
was similar to their home cage. rats were rated for the occurrence of
the following symptoms following drug injection: 1) flat body posture;
2) hindlimb abduction; 3) lateral head weaving; 4) resting tremor; 5)
forepaw treading; and 6) straub tail. each symptom was rated on an
intensity scale with 0 ⫽ absent, 1 ⫽ weak, 2 ⫽ moderate, and 3 ⫽
intense. an intensity score of 2 or greater was required for the
symptom to be considered as prominently presented. rats were
scored as showing the 5-ht behavioral syndrome if at least four of
the six symptoms were prominently presented during the observation period. these procedures have previously been used by this
laboratory to rate the 5-ht behavioral syndrome produced by full
agonists (lucki, 1992; singh and lucki, 1993).
[35s]gtp␥s binding. ligand-promoted binding of [35s]gtp␥s to
g proteins with the  xxxg1108xxx  expressed in sf9 cells was used
to compare the relative efficacy of compounds and was evaluated as
previously described (butkerait et al., 1995; barr and manning,
1997). 8-oh-pipat defines the effects of a full agonist, and vehicle
(or dmso) defines receptor constitutive activity. in the present
study, [35s]gtp␥s binding achieved with 8-oh-pipat was compared with that achieved with emd 68843, fluoxetine, and vehicle.
drugs. all drugs were prepared freshly on the day of use. emd 68843
(merck, darmstadt, germany) was dissolved in 6% dmso and injected i.p.
in a volume of 2 ml/kg in the rat studies. fluoxetine hydrochloride (lilly
research laboratories, indianapolis, in) was dissolved in deionized water
and injected i.p. in a volume of 2 ml/kg. r-8-oh-dpat hydrobromide
(sigma/rbi, natick, ma) was dissolved in deionized water. fluoxetine and
r-8-oh-dpat doses were calculated as the base weight. emd 68843
doses were calculated without correction. drugs were administered in a
volume of 10 ml/kg in the mouse studies.

data analysis. microdialysis data are reported as a percentage of
the control baseline values (determined from the mean of the final three
samples prior to drug injection). the transformed value (percentage of
baseline) was used as the dependent variable for assessment of withingroup effects. values for the mean and the nine samples collected
immediately after drug injection were included in the analyses. between-group analyses of dose differences or treatment differences
(emd versus fluoxetine) were conducted using two-way anova with
repeated measures over time. fisher’s post hoc test was used for comparison of group means relative to a control mean. the level of significance required for all post hoc analyses was p ⬍ 0.05. one-way anova
with repeated measures was used for comparison of drug values to a
baseline mean. two-way anova was performed to determine the influence of 8-oh-dpat on emd- and fluoxetine-elicited increases in
extracellular 5-ht. the new baseline value (100%) was defined by the
mean of the two samples following emd or fluoxetine injection. the
values were determined from the first sample following 8-oh-dpat
administration to the end of sample collection.
behavioral testing. to determine whether emd 68843 displayed
antidepressant-like activity similar to that observed for fluoxetine and
other ssris, we subjected rats to the fst, a test frequently used to reliably
screen for effective antidepressants. sprague-dawley rats (charles river
laboratories inc., wilmington, ma; 175–200 g at the start of the experiment) were housed in groups of two in polycarbonate cages and maintained
on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle in a temperature-controlled (22°c) colony with
free access to food and water. animals were handled for 5 min daily,
beginning 4 days prior to the onset of the experiment. animals were
randomly assigned to four groups (n ⫽ 7–8 rats/group) and were exposed
to a pretest swim session for 15 min 24 h prior to the 5-min swim test. rats
were placed into a glass cylinder (46 cm high ⫻ 20 cm wide) filled to a
30-cm depth with water at room temperature for 15 min. animals were
removed from the water, dried by the experimenter, and placed into plastic
cages with a heating pad. emd 68843 (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) or vehicle
(6% dmso) was administered s.c. three times following the initial 15-min
pretest exposure to the swim chamber. injections were given 23.5, 4.5, and
1 h prior to the swim test. the 5-min swim session was videotaped from
above for subsequent analysis of behavioral responses by a trained observer (detke et al., 1995a). the rater was blind with respect to treatment
group. swimming was defined as horizontal movement through the swim
chamber, which included crossing into another quadrant. climbing activity
consisted of upward-directed movements of the forepaws along the side of
the swim chamber, and immobility was assigned when no activity was
observed other than that necessary to keep the rat’s head above the water.
further support for an antidepressant action of emd 68843 was
obtained by testing this compound in another species. the dba/2j
strain of mouse has recently been shown to be responsive to 5-htacting compounds in the fst (lucki et al., 2001). thirty-eight male,
dba/2j mice (the jackson laboratory, bar harbor, me; 5– 6 weeks
old at arrival) were housed four per cage and given free access to food
and water. they were tested at 11 weeks of age. mice were injected
30 min prior to the swim with emd 68843 (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg,
i.p.) or dmso vehicle. the swim chamber (46 cm high ⫻ 20 cm wide)
was filled to 15 cm with room temperature water. the 6-min swim
session was videotaped from above for subsequent analysis. the last
4 min of the swim session were scored for behavior, which was

increase (95.7 ⫾ 26.2%) observed at the 20 mg/kg dose was

tors by a 5-ht transporter inhibitor may allow a single
molecule to evoke responses that are similar to those of drug
combinations that could augment the clinical effects of conventional ssris in treating depression, such as the combination of fluoxetine with  xxxd2957xxx . this hypothesis was tested
using in vivo microdialysis to show that systemic administration of emd 68843 increased extracellular levels of 5-ht
in the fc (527 versus 165%) and the hpv (558 versus 274%)
of the rat to a greater extent than the conventional ssri
fluoxetine. although the two compounds differ in potency at
5-ht transporters, the effects produced by systemic fluoxetine
are representative maximal effects for ssris, as shown for
other more potent ssris (reviewed by fuller, 1994; hjorth et
al., 2000) or for fluoxetine tested at higher doses (up to 40
mg/kg, i.p.; lucki, unpublished data). this finding provides an
important proof of principle for the conceptual development of
novel compounds with dual actions on the 5-ht transporter and
5-ht1a receptors that may elicit a faster onset or more therapeutically effective antidepressant response.
the augmentation of extracellular 5-ht achieved by acute
administration of emd 68843 is likely due to the combined
inhibition of the 5-ht transporter with partial agonist effects
at the 5-ht1a autoreceptor. sf9 cells provide an intact cell
setting for reconstitution of the human  xxxg1108xxx  with
g protein subunits that can assess the relative efficacy of
 xxxg1108xxx  agonists and antagonists under controlled
conditions (butkerait et al., 1995; barr and manning, 1997).
as shown in the present study, emd 68843 increased
[35s]gtp␥s binding to 69% of the magnitude of the full
 xxxg1108xxx  agonist 8-oh-pipat in sf9 cells, indicating
that it is a partial agonist at 5-ht1a receptors. in general,
conventional ssris have been shown to increase extracellular levels 2- to 4-fold at maximum effective dose, whereas
drugs that increase release, like fenfluramine, produce an
increase in extracellular levels of 5-ht in the 8- to 12-fold
range (fuller, 1994). although enhancement of 5-ht release
cannot be ruled out, emd 68843 does not produce a reduction
of 5-ht tissue content as does fenfluramine (c. seyfried,
merck, personal communication). previous studies have
shown that combining ssris with  xxxg1108xxx  antagonists, such as way 100635, augment extracellular levels of
5-ht in the cortex to a range above levels achieved by ssris
given alone but less than fenfluramine (artigas et al., 1996).
the blockade of 5-ht1a receptors limits the ability of endogenous 5-ht to interact with autoreceptors that decrease cell
firing and synthesis of 5-ht and, consequently, enhances
extracellular 5-ht levels in terminal regions (artigas et al.,
1996; hjorth et al., 2000). coadministration of  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonists, such as  xxxd2957xxx , way 100135, or tertatolol, also augments the effects of ssris on extracellular

with the 5-ht1a autoreceptor to limit the actions of 8-ohdpat as an autoreceptor agonist. thus, the augmented levels of extracellular 5-ht produced by 3 mg/kg emd 68843
probably involve the combination of 5-ht reuptake inhibition
and interference with 5-ht1a autoreceptors regulating 5-ht
transmission in the fc. in contrast, in the hpv, fluoxetineor emd 68843-induced increases in extracellular 5-ht levels
were attenuated in a similar fashion by subsequent systemic
administration of 8-oh-dpat, suggesting that 5-ht1a autoreceptor function may exert less regulation of extracellular
5-ht and the effects of emd 68843 in this region.
emd 68843 was examined for its ability to produce the 5-ht
syndrome and its interaction with the full  xxxg1108xxx  agonist
8-oh-dpat. the 5-ht behavioral syndrome is a series of unconditioned behavioral responses in rats evoked to study the activation of postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors in vivo (lucki, 1992). the
behavioral syndrome is also an animal model for a serious side
effect produced in humans by a number of antidepressant drugs
(gillman, 1998). emd 68843 did not produce the 5-ht syndrome
and completely prevented the actions of the more efficacious
 xxxg1108xxx  agonist 8-oh-dpat on the 5-ht behavioral syndrome. these results are similar to effects shown previously by
other  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonists and antagonists (singh and
lucki, 1993; detke et al., 1995b) because only high-efficacy agonists can produce the 5-ht behavioral syndrome. although a recent finding suggested that the full 5-ht1a agonist flibanserin
might block certain components of the 5-ht syndrome induced by
8-oh-dpat (borsini et al., 2001), this interference was attributed
to the likely involvement of flibanserin with ␣1 or 5-ht2a receptors. this is not the case for emd 68843.
the behavioral results in the mouse and rat fst provide
some support for the antidepressant potential of emd 68843
but over a limited dose range. in the rat fst, emd 68843
reduced immobility and increased swimming behavior. this
response pattern is similar to that shown many times to be
produced by conventional ssris, such as fluoxetine (10 –20
mg/kg, s.c.), and is mediated by 5-ht (lucki, 1997; page et al.,
1999). in the mouse fst, emd 68843 reduced immobility in
dba/2j mice similar to fluoxetine (5–20 mg/kg, i.p.; lucki et al.,
2001). these findings are consistent with the idea that antidepressant-like actions are mediated through the activation of
postsynaptic 5-ht receptors. however, doses of emd 68843
higher than 1 mg/kg were ineffective in both the mouse and the
rat fst. although multiple 5-ht receptors may be involved in
antidepressant behavioral responses, activation of postsynaptic
5-ht1a receptors appears to be important for producing behavioral effects of ssris in antidepressant tests (lucki et al., 1994;
de vry, 1995). pretreatment with  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonists or antagonists, or genetic deletion of 5-ht1a receptors can
prevent the behavioral effects of ssris (singh and lucki, 1993;
redrobe and bourin, 1998; mayorga et al., 2001; reneric et al.,
2001). thus, although the  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonist component of emd 68843 may enhance extracellular 5-ht levels,
at high doses it could also restrain expression of antidepressantlike behaviors in the fst, which predict clinical activity.
these findings have direct clinical implications for the development of faster-acting antidepressant compounds. the greater elevation of extracellular 5-ht levels achieved by emd 68843 compared with fluoxetine can improve ssri response and is
qualitatively similar to augmentation effects achieved by the combination of ssris with  xxxd2957xxx  (perez, 1997; mcaskill et al., 1998;
olver et al., 2000). a single molecule producing more efficacious

5-ht levels (fletcher et al., 1993; romero et al., 1996; gartside et al., 1999; hjorth et al., 2000). however, the mechanism underlying this effect is not easily understood because
 xxxg1108xxx  partial agonists produce complex effects.
partial agonists activate presynaptic 5-ht1a receptors but
block the effects of  xxxg1108xxx  agonists at postsynaptic
receptors because of the different receptor reserve of 5-ht1a
receptors at these anatomical locations (cox et al., 1993).
although  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonists inhibit 5-ht neuronal activity and reduce 5-ht synthesis, 5-ht1a autoreceptor activation by a full agonist, such as the endogenous neurotransmitter, can be diminished by pretreatment with a
partial agonist (arborelius et al., 2000). nevertheless, additional pharmacological mechanisms may contribute to augmenting extracellular 5-ht levels in terminal regions when
 xxxg1108xxx  partial agonists are combined with ssris.
one possible mechanism may be that partial agonists rapidly
desensitize 5-ht1a autoreceptors, thereby inhibiting their
functional activity and reducing their ability to inhibit 5-ht
transmission (romero et al., 1996). other possible mechanisms could involve postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors in terminal regions that participate in an inhibitory feedback loop to
negatively regulate 5-ht transmission (bosker et al., 1997;
casanovas et al., 1999) or direct effects on 5-ht release.
an important determinant of the effects of fluoxetine and
emd 68843 was the brain region being sampled. previous microdialysis studies have described differential regulation of
5-ht transmission by the 5-ht1a autoreceptor in distinct brain
regions (kreiss and lucki, 1994, 1997; malagie et al., 1996;
invernizzi et al., 1997; romero and artigas, 1997; knobelman
et al., 2001). extracellular 5-ht levels demonstrate regional
differences in sensitivity to 5-ht1a autoreceptor regulation, as
shown previously when the  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way
100635 potentiated the effects of fluoxetine to a greater extent
in the fc than in the dorsal hippocampus (hervas and artigas,
1998). preferential innervation of the fc by serotonergic fibers
from the dr and the innervation of the hpv by mr fibers
(kosofsky and molliver, 1987) and greater responsiveness of dr
neurons to the autoinhibitory actions of 5-ht on 5-ht1a receptors (sinton and fallon, 1988; blier et al., 1990; romero and
artigas, 1997) may contribute to regional differences in the
response to ssris. also, fluoxetine appeared to induce a
smaller increase of extracellular 5-ht in the frontal cortex than
in the hpv, which is comparable with findings from other laboratories (fuller et al., 1994; kreiss and lucki, 1995; invernizzi
et al., 1996; hervas and artigas, 1998).
emd 68843 also elicited regional changes in extracellular 5-ht.
the greater increase in the hpv than the fc with the low (0.3
mg/kg) dose reflected regional differences in the response to systemic administration of ssris. the 3.0 mg/kg dose increased extracellular 5-ht levels in the fc for a longer time than the hpv,
possibly reflecting the influence of blockade of 5-ht1a receptors in
a region under greater control by the 5-ht1a autoreceptor.
the involvement of 5-ht1a autoreceptor mechanisms was
addressed by examining the ability of the  xxxg1108xxx 
agonist, 8-oh-dpat, to reduce the elevated 5-ht levels
achieved by emd 68843 or fluoxetine administration. in the
fc, 8-oh-dpat reduced extracellular 5-ht levels to near
baseline levels in fluoxetine-treated animals only, whereas
the emd 68843-treated animals demonstrated only a transient reduction of extracellular 5-ht in response to 8-ohdpat. this result is consistent with emd 68843 interfering

ssri and 5-ht1a ligand augments 5-ht neurotransmission

enhancement of extracellular 5-ht may also be more advantageous for other indications of ssris and circumvent potential
pharmacokinetic interactions caused by the use of drug combinations (olver et al., 2000). however, preclinical studies implicate the
activation of postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors as important for antidepressant responses to ssris (see lucki et al., 1994; blier et al.,
1997; cryan and leonard, 2000). whether the  xxxg1108xxx 
partial agonist component of emd 68843 would impede or facilitate antidepressant responses when tested clinically is unknown.
in conclusion, the present findings demonstrate that a single compound with dual effects on 5-ht transporters and 5-ht1a receptors can produce a greater impact on extracellular 5-ht levels
than conventional ssris. these intrinsically augmented effects
may contribute to increasing the therapeutic effects of serotonergic
antidepressants.
