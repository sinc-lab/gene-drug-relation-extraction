abstract
 xxxd3185xxx , a fully human anti- xxxg1166xxx  monoclonal antibody, neutralizes  xxxg1166xxx , a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. efficacy and safety of  xxxd3185xxx  was evaluated in japanese patients with moderate-tosevere plaque psoriasis as part of a large phase 3 global study (erasure). in this 52-week, double-blind study
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01365455, japiccti-111529), 87 patients from japan (11.8% of 738 patients randomized in the overall study population) were equally randomized to receive  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg or 150 mg, or
placebo once weekly at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, then every 4 weeks. co-primary endpoints (week 12)
were ≥75% improvement in psoriasis area-and-severity index (pasi 75) from baseline and a score of 0 (clear) or 1
(almost clear) on a 5-point investigator’s global assessment scale (iga mod 2011 0/1) versus placebo. pasi 75
and iga mod 2011 0/1 responses at week 12 were superior with  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg (82.8% and 55.2%, respectively) or 150 mg (86.2% and 55.2%, respectively) versus placebo (6.9% and 3.4%, respectively; p < 0.0001 for all).
greater than 90% improvement in pasi (pasi 90) was also superior with  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg (62.1%) or 150 mg
(55.2%) versus placebo (0.0%) at week 12 (p < 0.0001 for both). clinical responses were sustained up to week 52
in the majority of patients. during a 12-week induction period, adverse event incidences were 48.3% with  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg, 55.2% with 150 mg, and 41.4% with placebo.  xxxd3185xxx  showed robust and sustainable efficacy in symptom reduction for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the japanese patients.

introduction
psoriasis is a chronic relapsing t-cell–mediated autoimmune
disease of the skin affecting physical, social, and mental wellbeing of patients.1 although the prevalence of psoriasis in the
japanese population (0.3%) is estimated to be less compared
with countries with a mostly caucasian population (2–3%), this
still accounts for a substantial number (~400 000 people in
japan).2 the disease is a challenge for affected patients, and
can be difficult to treat due to associated disease pathogenesis. according to a survey of the japanese population with
psoriasis, 89.2% of them had plaque psoriasis, with approximately 50% having moderate-to-severe disease.3

owing to the limitations of the traditional systemic agents (i.e.,
limited efficacy, as well as safety issues), biological agents are
now becoming a preferred choice of treatment.4,5 th17 cells are
a class of t-helper cells that regulate innate and adaptive immunity. their primary effector, interleukin (il)-17a, is associated
with pathophysiologic mechanisms of psoriasis and is currently
viewed as an important target in the management of psoriasis.6,7
 xxxd3185xxx  (novartis pharma ag, basel, switzerland) is a
novel recombinant, high-affinity, fully human immunoglobulin
g1j monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralizes  xxxg1166xxx .8 in phase 2 studies,  xxxd3185xxx  demonstrated a
rapid and sustained efficacy in improving psoriasis symptoms,
with an acceptable safety profile.9,10

m. ohtsuki et al.

a phase 3 study, efficacy of response and safety of two
fixed  xxxd3185xxx  regimens in psoriasis (erasure), was
conducted to confirm the findings of early clinical studies on
the crucial role of  xxxg1166xxx  in psoriasis. this randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to assess the efficacy,
safety, and tolerability during the induction (up to week 12)
and maintenance (up to week 52) periods with  xxxd3185xxx 
300 or 150 mg in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque
psoriasis. the outcomes of the erasure study in the overall study population have been reported recently.11 the data
presented here pertain to the japanese patients from
erasure.

methods
the study protocol was approved by the institutional review
board of each participating site, and the study was conducted
in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and good clinical practice guideline. eligible patients provided written
informed consent.

study population
male and female patients (≥18 years old) with moderate-to
-severe plaque psoriasis (psoriasis area-and-severity index
[pasi] score ≥12, modified 2011 static 5-point investigator’s
global assessment [iga mod 2011]12 score ≥3, and body
surface area [bsa] involvement ≥10%) who had been diagnosed for at least 6 months and whose psoriasis was inadequately controlled by topical treatments, phototherapy,
and/or previous systemic therapy were eligible to enter the
study.
the key exclusion criteria were forms of psoriasis other than
chronic plaque, ongoing use of prohibited psoriasis treatments
or prohibited nonpsoriasis medications, or previous exposure
to  xxxd3185xxx  or any other biologic drug directly targeting
 xxxg1166xxx  or the  xxxg1166xxx  receptor.

study design
details of the erasure study have been reported recently.11
briefly, erasure was a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-group, phase 3 study that was conducted
between june 2011 and april 2013 at 88 sites worldwide (738
patients) including 18 sites in japan (87 patients). the study
consisted of a screening period of 1–4 weeks, a 12-week
induction period, a 40-week maintenance period, and an
8-week follow-up period (fig. s1).
eligible patients were randomized (1:1:1) to  xxxd3185xxx 
300 mg,  xxxd3185xxx  150 mg, or placebo, with all doses
given once weekly at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4,
then every 4 weeks until week 48. patients randomized to  xxxd3185xxx  received either two 150 mg subcutaneous  xxxd3185xxx  injections (i.e., 300 mg) or one 150 mg injection plus
one placebo injection. patients randomized to placebo
received two placebo injections. in the placebo arm, patients
who achieved pasi 75 responses (i.e., ≥75% improvement in
pasi score from baseline) at week 12 were continued on placebo, but those who did not achieve pasi 75 responses at

2

week 12 were re-randomized (1:1) to  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg or
150 mg. efficacy data for the patients re-randomized to  xxxd3185xxx  is not presented here.

study outcomes
efficacy analyses were conducted throughout the study, with
key assessments at the end of the induction period before the
dose at week 12 was administered, and at the end of the
maintenance period at week 52 (i.e., 4 weeks after the last
dose of  xxxd3185xxx  or its matching placebo).
the co-primary efficacy variables were the proportion of
patients who achieved ≥75% improvement in pasi score
from baseline at week 12 (pasi 75), and the proportion of
patients who achieved an iga mod 2011 score of 0 (clear)
or 1 (almost clear) combined with a 2-point improvement
from the baseline score at week 12 (iga mod 2011 0/1).
pasi scoring evaluates psoriasis severity using subscores for
erythema, thickness, and scale/desquamation of psoriasis, as
well as affected bsa12 (range for total score: 0–72 points).
the modified iga scale used in this study is a static 5-point
instrument (the clinician’s impression of overall psoriasis
severity, range 0 [ xxxd3159xxx ] to 4 [severe disease]) designed
to be more stringent than the global assessment scales (iga
or patient global assessment [pga]) used in trials of other
biologics.13
key secondary efficacy variables included the proportion of
patients who achieved ≥90% improvement in pasi score from
baseline at week 12 (pasi 90). other assessments included
pasi 75/90/100 (pasi 100 indicates  xxxd3159xxx ) and iga mod
2011 0/1 responses at each assessment up to week 52 and
achievement of a score of 0 or 1 on the dermatology life quality index (dlqi) at week 12 or week 52. dlqi is a validated
instrument for evaluating quality of life in dermatologic conditions (range, 0–30 points, higher scores indicate greater impact
on quality of life).14
safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse events (aes),
including their severity, seriousness, and relationship to the
study drug, and by assessing clinical laboratory parameters,
vital signs, and physical examination findings at study visits.
immunogenicity assessments for anti- xxxd3185xxx  antibodies
were performed using a two-step assay on blood samples collected at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 52, and 60.

statistical analyses
the efficacy variables were analyzed using all randomized
patients according to the treatment assigned at randomization.
the efficacy parameters including pasi 75, 90, 100, and iga
mod 2011 0/1 response rates were summarized by visit and by
treatment group. fisher’s exact test was performed (for the
japanese patients) for pairwise treatment group comparison
with placebo (300 mg vs placebo and 150 mg vs placebo) for
the induction treatment period. the missing values for pasi
and iga mod 2011 scores were conservatively imputed as
nonresponse regardless of the reason for the missing data.
summary statistics was provided for the dlqi total score and
the number of patients achieving dlqi 0/1 response. missing

12 was also achieved by a significantly higher proportion of
japanese patients in each of the  xxxd3185xxx  dose groups
compared with placebo; pasi 75 response of 82.8% (n = 24)
for 300 mg group, 86.2% (n = 25) for 150 mg group compared
with 6.9% (n = 2) for placebo group (p < 0.0001 for both dose
groups; fig. 1a); and iga mod 2011 0/1 response of 55.2%
(n = 16) for both the  xxxd3185xxx  dose groups versus 3.4%
(n = 1) for placebo group (p < 0.0001 for both the  xxxd3185xxx  dose groups). pasi 90 response at week 12 was
superior for the  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg (62.1%; n = 18) and
150 mg (55.2%; n = 16) versus placebo (0.0%; p < 0.0001 for
both  xxxd3185xxx  dose groups). pasi 100 response at week
12 was achieved by eight (27.6%) patients in the  xxxd3185xxx 
300 mg group and three (10.3%) patients in the  xxxd3185xxx 
150 mg dose group (p < 0.01 for  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg vs placebo) (fig. 1a). a rapid improvement in clinical response was
observed with  xxxd3185xxx . at week 4, pasi 75 response
was 31.0% (n = 9) and 37.9% (n = 11) with  xxxd3185xxx 
300 mg and 150 mg, respectively versus 3.4% (n = 1) with placebo (p < 0.01 for  xxxd3185xxx  150 mg vs placebo).
figure 1b displays the pasi responses over the 52-week
treatment period in the japanese patients. pasi (75/90/100)
and iga mod 2011 0/1 response rates further improved from
week 12 to 16 with pasi 75, 90, 100 responses of 82.8%
(n = 24), 72.4% (n = 21), 41.4% (n = 12) for  xxxd3185xxx 
300 mg and 86.2% (n = 25), 69.0% (n = 20), 6.9% (n = 2) for
150 mg at week 16. at week 16, iga mod 2011 0/1 response
was 62.1% (n = 18) for  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg group and
55.2% (n = 16) for 150 mg group. these japanese patients’
data were consistent with the overall population in the

dlqi scores were imputed using the last observation carried
forward approach. safety parameters were evaluated for all
patients who received at least one dose of study drug and
were summarized descriptively.

results
study patients
eighty-seven japanese patients were randomized to  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg (n = 29),  xxxd3185xxx  150 mg (n = 29), and
placebo (n = 29). at week 12, 25 patients on placebo who
were pasi 75 non-responders were re-randomized to  xxxd3185xxx . eighty-one patients (93.1%) completed the 12-week
induction period and 77 (88.5%) completed the entire 52-week
treatment period. the common reasons for discontinuation in
induction phase were aes for  xxxd3185xxx  150 mg and placebo, and protocol deviation for  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg and
placebo (fig. s2). demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar among the three treatment arms, including age, body weight, and disease severity. baseline disease
severity indicator pasi/bsa/iga mod 2011 showed similar
scores (pasi:  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg/150 mg/placebo: 26.7/
28.2/21.4, respectively) among the three treatment arms
(table 1).

the  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg,  xxxd3185xxx  150 mg, and placebo groups who achieved at least 75% improvement in pasi score from
baseline (pasi 75 response; panel a), at least 90% improvement in pasi score from baseline (pasi 90 response; panel b), and complete clearance of psoriasis as measured by the pasi scoring system (pasi 100 response; panel c), iga mod 2011 score of
0 = clear or 1 = almost clear, and an improvement of at least two points on the iga mod 2011 0/1 scale compared with baseline
(iga mod 2011 0/1 response; panel d) through week 12 (a) and through week 52 (b) is shown. missing values were imputed as
non-response for clinical response up to 12 weeks and up to 52 weeks. only patients evaluable for responses were included. n,

erasure study that showed an increase in clinical response
up to week 16 (pasi 75, 90, 100 response at week 16 was
86.1%, 69.8%, and 41.6%, respectively, for the 300 mg group
and 77.4%, 53.5%, and 21.0%, respectively, for 150 mg
group) (table s1).
at week 52, pasi 75, 90, 100, and iga mod 2011 0/1
responses were 86.2% (n = 25), 69.0% (n = 20), 41.4%
(n = 12), and 62.1% (n = 18) for  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg and

(n = 10) for 150 mg (fig. 1b).
although this study was not designed to statistically compare efficacy parameters between the  xxxd3185xxx  dose levels,  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg consistently produced numerically
higher pasi and iga mod 2011 0/1 response rates than
150 mg particularly in the maintenance period in the japanese
patients and the overall study population (table s1).

placebo; p < 0.01 for  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg vs placebo). the
clinical responses were sustained through the maintenance
period with  xxxd3185xxx  treatment. at week 52, the proportion of patients achieving dlqi score of 0 or 1 was 75.0%
(n = 21) for  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg and 65.5% (n = 19) for
150 mg (fig. 2).

previous exposure to biologic therapy
seventeen patients had been previously exposed to biologics
( xxxd3185xxx  300 mg, n = 6;  xxxd3185xxx  150 mg, n = 5;
placebo, n = 6) (table 1). both doses of  xxxd3185xxx  provided
a greater pasi 75 response (83.3% [n = 5] for 300 mg; 100.0%
[n = 5] for 150 mg) and pasi 90 response (50.0% [n = 3] for
300 mg; 60.0% [n = 3] for 150 mg) versus placebo (0% for
both pasi 75 and pasi 90) at week 12 in the subgroup previously exposed to biologic therapy. the trend was similar
between patients who were exposed to biologics and those
with no prior exposure (fig. 3).

safety
there were no deaths reported in the japanese patients as
well as in the overall study population. during the induction
period, the incidence of non-fatal serious adverse events
(saes) was low (one patient for both pulmonary oedema and
cardiac failure and one patient for type 2 diabetes mellitus in
the  xxxd3185xxx  150 mg group and none in  xxxd3185xxx 
300 mg and placebo groups). adverse events (aes) were comparable among three groups (48.3% [n = 14] for 300 mg;
55.2% [n = 16] for  xxxd3185xxx  150 mg; and 41.4% [n = 12]
for placebo) (table 2). aes leading to early discontinuation
(during the induction period) included: psoriatic erythroderma
and alopecia (not psoriasis area) in  xxxd3185xxx  150 mg
group; left lower extremity herpes (not psoriasis area) in placebo group; and none in  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg group.
during the entire treatment period, no dose relationship
was observed for aes. the exposure-adjusted incidence of
aes per 100 patient-years over the entire treatment period
was 199.7 (n = 31) for  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg, 290.7 (n = 37)
for 150 mg, and 223.1 (n = 13) for placebo (table 2). two
patients experienced saes during the maintenance period,
pneumonia ( xxxd3185xxx  300 mg) and aortic thrombosis/aneurysim ( xxxd3185xxx  150 mg, re-randomized from placebo).
overall, saes (per 100 patient years) in the entire treatment
period were 2.8 (n = 1) in  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg; 8.5 (n = 3) in
 xxxd3185xxx  150 mg; and none in placebo. aortic thrombosis/aneurysm and otitis externa bacterial in  xxxd3185xxx 
150 mg group were the aes leading to discontinuation during

maintenance period. the most common aes (per 100 patient
years) in the entire treatment period were nasopharyngitis
( xxxd3185xxx  300 mg, 26.8 [n = 8];  xxxd3185xxx  150 mg,
81.0 [n = 20]; placebo, 66.4 [n = 5]), pharyngitis ( xxxd3185xxx 
300 mg, 0;  xxxd3185xxx  150 mg, 11.6 [n = 4]; placebo, 0)
and eczema ( xxxd3185xxx  300 mg, 8.7 [n = 3];  xxxd3185xxx 
150 mg, 11.5 [n = 4]; placebo, 0).
treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ada; i.e., negative
at baseline, positive after initiation of  xxxd3185xxx ) were not
detected in any of the japanese patients, whereas ada were
detected in two patients (0.3%, 2/738) who were receiving
150 mg  xxxd3185xxx  in the overall erasure study population.

discussion
 xxxd3185xxx , a novel, selective anti– xxxg1166xxx  targeted therapy
improved psoriasis symptoms rapidly and elicited significantly
greater pasi 75 and iga mod 2011 0/1 responses compared
with placebo at week 12 (co-primary end points) in the japanese patients, consistent with the overall erasure study
results.11 at week 12, pasi 75 response was achieved by
82.8% of the japanese patients in the  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg
group, and by 86.2% in the 150 mg group versus 6.9% in the
placebo group, compared with 81.6% and 71.6% versus 4.5%
in the overall study population. a rapid (at week 4) clinical
response (for pasi 75) and improvement in quality of life (measured by dlqi score) were observed with  xxxd3185xxx  versus

placebo. the primary study efficacy evaluations (superiority vs
placebo) were performed at week 12, but maximum efficacy
was observed around week 16, similar to the overall population.
consistent with the response in the overall study population,
the efficacy was sustained in the majority of the japanese
patients through 52 weeks, with continued  xxxd3185xxx  therapy every 4 weeks. at week 52, pasi 90 response was
achieved by 69.0% patients in the  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg group
and 41.4% of patients in the 150 mg group for the japanese
patients, compared with 60.0% and 36.2%, respectively, for
the overall study population. these efficacy results are also
comparable to the fixture study (pasi 90 response of 65.0%
and 45.0% in  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg and 150 mg, respectively,
at week 52), where  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg and 150 mg doses
were compared with placebo and etanercept (33.4%), an
active comparator; however, this study did not include patients
from japan.11
the results from the japanese patients also suggest superior efficacy of the  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg dose compared with
150 mg dose to achieve the target treatment goals of pasi
90 and iga mod 2011 0/1 responses particularly in the maintenance period. although this study was not designed to
statistically evaluate the efficacy differences between the two
 xxxd3185xxx  doses, the results favor the 300 mg dose.
these results were consistent with the overall study population as well as other published data on  xxxd3185xxx  from
the fixture study.11

least 5 per 100 patient-years during the entire treatment period; listed in descending order of frequency for the combined  xxxd3185xxx  arms during
the induction period. ae, adverse event; n, number of patients.

there is a scarcity of literature on the effect of biologics in
patients having received treatment with other biologic agents.15
our study assessed the relationship between exposure to prior
biological therapy and responsiveness to  xxxd3185xxx  in
patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. both doses
of  xxxd3185xxx  were associated with an improvement in all
efficacy evaluations (pasi 75, pasi 90, and iga mod 2011 0/1)
versus placebo, regardless of whether they had previously
been exposed to biologic therapy.
psoriasis is associated with a range of health risks and
comorbid inflammatory diseases which adversely affect the
quality of life. measures of psoriasis severity such as pasi,
iga, or bsa capture psoriasis severity from the treating physician’s perspective. patient-reported outcomes, to assess
the patient’s health status or quality of life are increasingly
being used to guide clinical care.16,17 in this study, investigator-assessed sign and symptom reduction was accompanied
by improvement in patient-reported health related quality of
life measured by dlqi. majority of patients reported quality
of life improvement (dlqi 0 or 1) with both doses of  xxxd3185xxx  versus placebo at week 12 which was sustained
through 52 weeks. improvement in the dlqi scores was
higher with the  xxxd3185xxx  300 mg dose compared with
the 150 mg dose throughout the treatment period. these
results were similar to the responses observed in the overall
study population.11

the safety profile of  xxxd3185xxx  in the japanese patients
was consistent with that reported in the phase 2 and 3 studies.9–11 no new or unexpected safety signals were observed.
the incidences of aes and saes during the induction period
and over the entire 52-week treatment period were comparable
between the two doses of  xxxd3185xxx .
in conclusion, analyses from the erasure study demonstrated clinical benefits of  xxxd3185xxx  treatment accompanying improvement in quality of life in the japanese patients with
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. early onset of efficacy
was sustained over the entire treatment period.  xxxd3185xxx 
300 mg dose was of greater benefit than the 150 mg dose,
particularly in the maintenance period. previous exposure to
biologics had no apparent impact on the response to treatment.  xxxd3185xxx  also showed an acceptable safety and tolerability profile for both doses, and over the entire 52-week
treatment period.
