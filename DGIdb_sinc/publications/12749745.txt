summary
abstract

 xxxd53xxx  (reopro®) is an antibody fragment that dose-dependently inhibits
platelet aggregation and leucocyte adhesion by binding to the glycoprotein (gp)
iib/iiia,  xxxg2422xxx  and  xxxg1206xxx   xxxg1209xxx  receptors.
 xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus plus infusion of 0.125 mug/kg/min for 12 hours)
showed greater efficacy than  xxxd3385xxx  in reducing the 30-day composite endpoint
of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (mi) or urgent target-vessel revascularisation in the randomised, double-blind target study in patients scheduled
for stent placement. in addition, the beneficial effects of treatment with  xxxd53xxx 
previously observed in the randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled epilog
and epistent studies have been maintained to 1 year, with a significantly
reduced incidence of ischaemic complications relative to placebo consistently
observed across a range of subgroups including age, sex, bodyweight and indication for revascularisation.

the incidence of the composite endpoint was reduced in patients presenting
with acute mi of <48 hours’ duration in comparison with either fibrinolytic
therapy or stenting alone in the randomised stopami and admiral trials,
primarily because of a reduced requirement for urgent repeat revascularisation
and reduced incidence of mortality. in the randomised, nonblind, multicentre
cadillac trial in patients with acute myocardial infarction (mi), stenting alone
was superior to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca) and
stenting alone was not inferior to ptca plus  xxxd53xxx .
recent large randomised, multicentre studies (assent-3 and gusto-v)
have shown higher efficacy (on various ischaemic endpoints) of  xxxd53xxx  in
combination with either a reduced dose of  xxxd3308xxx  or reteplase compared with
the fibrinolytic drug alone. timi grade 3 flow rates at 60 and 90 minutes in the
timi-14 and speed trials were higher in patients who received  xxxd53xxx  in
combination with either  xxxg1766xxx  or reteplase than  xxxd53xxx  alone and were
similar to that seen with the full-dose fibrinolytic alone.
in the randomised, multicentre gusto iv-acs study, no significant differences in any of the ischaemic endpoints at either 7 or 30 days in patients with acute
coronary syndromes who were not scheduled to undergo early revascularisation
(within 12 hours of end of infusion) were apparent between those who received
 xxxd53xxx  (bolus and either 24- or 48-hour infusion) and those who received
placebo in addition to aspirin and heparin.
the most common adverse events associated with the use of  xxxd53xxx  are
bleeding complications and thrombocytopenia, although the risk of major bleeding can be limited through adhering to current administration protocols.
treatment costs are generally higher in both stent plus  xxxd53xxx  and angioplasty plus  xxxd53xxx  groups than stent plus placebo, primarily because of the
acquisition cost of  xxxd53xxx .  xxxd53xxx  appeared most cost beneficial in
high-risk patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary revascularisation;
among lower risk patients,  xxxd53xxx  therapy has been associated with higher
total in-hospital and 6-month medical costs than  xxxd2017xxx .
conclusion: the gp iib/iiia receptor antagonist  xxxd53xxx , when used with
aspirin and heparin, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the short- and long-term risk of ischaemic complications in patients with ischaemic heart disease
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, when used with aspirin and
heparin. high-risk patients (including those with diabetes mellitus) derive particular benefits from  xxxd53xxx  treatment.  xxxd53xxx  remains an important therapeutic option for the prevention of complications in patients with ischaemic heart
disease.

overview of
pharmacology

 xxxd53xxx  is an antibody fragment that inhibits platelet aggregation by binding to
the glycoprotein (gp) iib/iiia receptor.  xxxd53xxx  also binds to the  xxxg2422xxx 
and  xxxg1206xxx   xxxg1209xxx  receptors. inhibition of platelet aggregation is correlated with the
degree of gp iib/iiia receptor blockade. an intravenous (iv) bolus of  xxxd53xxx 
0.25 mg/kg blocks >80% of gp iib/iiia receptors and produces the maximum
antiplatelet effect (>80% inhibition of adp-induced platelet aggregation)  xxxd1891xxx 
minutes after treatment initiation. continuous infusion (0.125 mug/kg/min or 10 mug/
min) after the bolus maintains near maximal platelet inhibition. however, marked
interindividual variability has been observed in the degree of platelet inhibition in
patients undergoing revascularisation.
ex vivo, administration of  xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus then 10 mug/min for 12
hours) to patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularisation has shown
generally equivalent inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to adp or
 xxxg746xxx -activating peptide (trap) as  xxxd3385xxx  or  xxxd2017xxx , although
dosage regimens of  xxxd3385xxx  and  xxxd2017xxx  varied between some studies.
platelet aggregation was significantly increased relative to baseline following
fibrinolytic therapy with either  xxxg1766xxx  or reteplase in patients with acute
myocardial infarction (mi; n = 51) enrolled in the dose-finding timi-14 trial, but
no significant differences in platelet aggregation at 90 minutes or 24 hours were
evident between patients who received  xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus) with either
reduced doses of reteplase (a 5u bolus and either 5 or 10u bolus) or  xxxg1766xxx 
(dose range 35 to 65mg); all patients receiving combination  xxxd53xxx /fibrinolytic therapy achieved >80% inhibition of platelet aggregation at 90 minutes which
was sustained for ≥24 hours after initiation of  xxxd53xxx  treatment. the addition
of ticlopidine to treatment maintained the platelet inhibition achieved with  xxxd53xxx  therapy during the first 24 hours.
in addition to inhibition of platelet aggregation,  xxxd53xxx  has shown potentially antithrombotic effects which are independent of heparin administration.
 xxxd53xxx  inhibits platelet-dependent thrombin generation, most likely through
blockade of both gp iib/iiia and  xxxg2422xxx  receptors. blockade of  xxxg2422xxx 
receptors prevents smooth muscle cell adhesion and migration, thus reducing
intimal proliferation. moreover,  xxxd53xxx  may inhibit activated  xxxg1206xxx   xxxg1209xxx  receptors,
thus reducing monocyte and polymorphonuclear leucocyte recruitment at the site
of vascular injury.
 xxxd53xxx  binds rapidly to platelets after administration and has an initial
half-life of > 10 minutes and a second phase half-life of about 30 minutes. platelet
function generally recovers within 48 hours, although platelet-bound  xxxd53xxx  is
still detectable 15 days or more after administration in a platelet-bound state.

therapeutic use in
percutaneous coronary
intervention

in general patient populations:  xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus plus infusion of
0.125 mug/kg/min for 12 hours) has been investigated as an adjunct to aspirin and
heparin in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. large well
designed studies have shown  xxxd53xxx  prevents acute ischaemic complications
(death, mi or urgent revascularisation).

 xxxd53xxx  demonstrated greater efficacy at 30 days than  xxxd3385xxx  treatment
(10 mug/kg bolus then 0.15 mug/kg/min iv infusion for 18 to 24 hours) in the
randomised, double-blind, multicentre target study in patients scheduled for
stent placement. at 30 days, the composite endpoint of death, nonfatal mi or
urgent target-vessel revascularisation occurred in significantly fewer patients who
received  xxxd53xxx  than received  xxxd3385xxx  (6.0 and 7.6%, respectively), mainly
because of a greater number of mi events in patients treated with  xxxd3385xxx  (5.4 vs
6.9%).
the beneficial effects of treatment with  xxxd53xxx  previously observed in the
randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled epilog and epistent studies
have been maintained to 1 year, with a significantly reduced incidence of
ischaemic complications relative to placebo which was consistently observed
across a range of subgroups (including age, sex, bodyweight and indication for
revascularisation). factors which were significantly and independently associated
with improved survival at 1 year in multivariate analysis in epistent were use
of  xxxd53xxx  in combination with stenting (versus placebo and stenting alone),
and preprocedural percentage diameter stenosis, whereas worse survival was
associated with previous congestive heart failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, age
>70 years and postprocedural timi grade 0 flow. nonetheless,  xxxd53xxx  has
demonstrated efficacy, reducing the composite endpoint of death, mi or
target-vessel revascularisation, in a prospectively defined subset of patients with
diabetes mellitus undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in the epistent study.
in acute myocardial infarction: five randomised comparative studies
(admiral, cadillac, stopami, stopami-2, and isar-2) have investigated the use of  xxxd53xxx  in combination with stent placement in patients with
acute mi. both stopami and admiral studies reported that patients receiving
 xxxd53xxx  plus stent showed a significantly reduced composite endpoint compared to either fibrinolytic therapy or stent alone at 30 days. in stopami-2
patients receiving  xxxd53xxx  plus stent showed a greater myocardial salvage
index than those receiving  xxxd53xxx  plus  xxxg1766xxx . results of the cadillac
study suggest that stent plus  xxxd53xxx , angioplasty plus  xxxd53xxx  and stent
alone each leads to significantly better outcomes at 30 days compared to angioplasty alone. patients receiving stent plus  xxxd53xxx  showed a significantly
lower rate of revascularisation than those receiving angioplasty either alone or in
combination with  xxxd53xxx .
in the admiral study, blood flow was greater in patients who received
 xxxd53xxx  than in placebo recipients immediately following revascularisation
(timi grade 3 flow achieved in 95.1% vs 86.7% of patients; p = 0.04) and at 6
months with (94.3% vs 82.8%).
recent large randomised, nonblind, multicentre studies (assent-3 and gusto-v) have shown higher efficacy with  xxxd53xxx  in combination with either a

reduced dose of  xxxd3308xxx  or reteplase than the full-dose fibrinolytic drug
alone.
the effect of  xxxd53xxx  in combination with fibrinolytic therapy (either
 xxxg1766xxx , streptokinase or reteplase) on reperfusion after acute mi was investigated in the timi-14 and speed trials. more patients who received  xxxd53xxx  in
combination with fibrinolytic therapy in timi-14 and speed achieved timi
grade 3 flow rates at 60 and 90 minutes than those who received  xxxd53xxx  alone.
in timi-14, at both 60 and 90 minutes timi grade 3 flow rates were significantly
greater in patients receiving  xxxd53xxx  plus fibrinolytic therapy than than in those
receiving full-dose fibrinolytic alone (p = 0.0009 and 0.02, respectively). in the
multicentre speed study, the percentage of patients achieving timi grade 3 flow
rates 60 to 90 minutes after reperfusion treatment was greatest in patients who
received two 5u boluses reteplase plus  xxxd53xxx  (62%).
pooled analyses: pooled analysis of large, randomised, placebo-controlled
trials involving  xxxd53xxx  (>9000 patients) showed a decrease in mortality of
approximately 30% compared with placebo at 1 year; mortality was also reduced
to a similar extent with either angioplasty or stenting (both approximately 30%).
analyses from the epic, epilog and epistent trials showed that the overall
treatment benefit (as indicated by 30-day and 6-month ischaemic outcomes) with
 xxxd53xxx  was observed irrespective of sex or smoking status.
in meta-analyses of prospective, randomised placebo-controlled trials gp iib/
iiia antagonists reduced the need for urgent revascularisation but had no effect on
mortality compared to placebo.  xxxd53xxx  but not  xxxd2017xxx  or  xxxd3385xxx 
significantly reduced the incidence of acute mi compared to placebo.
in patients without early revascularisation: in the randomised, multicentre gusto iv-acs study, no differences were apparent between groups of
patients with acs who were not scheduled to undergo early revascularisation
(within 12 hours of end of infusion) who had received  xxxd53xxx  (bolus and either
24- or 48-hour infusion) in addition to aspirin and heparin in any of the ischaemic
endpoints at either 7 or 30 days (primary endpoint) compared with placebo.
tolerability

the most common adverse events associated with the use of  xxxd53xxx  are
bleeding complications and thrombocytopenia, although the risk of major bleeding can be limited through careful selection of patients, use of a low-dose,
bodyweight-adjusted regimen of heparin, discontinuation of heparin immediately
following revascularisation, early removal of the vascular sheath and femoral
artery access site care.
in recent large, randomised clinical trials (admiral, gusto iv-acs and
target), the incidence of major bleeding with a standard dose of  xxxd53xxx 
(0.6–0.7% of patients) was similar to that seen with placebo (0% and 0.3%) and
 xxxd3385xxx  (0.9%), although extension of the  xxxd53xxx  infusion to 48 hours
significantly increased the incidence of major bleeding complications relative to
placebo in one arm of the gusto iv-acs trial (1% vs 0.3%). rates of minor

bleeding were significantly greater (3–12.1%) than with either placebo (2% and
3.3%) or  xxxd3385xxx  (2.8%).
thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 × 109/l) developed in 2.4–7% of
 xxxd53xxx -treated patients (the higher value was recorded in patients receiving a
48 hour infusion of  xxxd53xxx  in gusto iv-acs) compared with ≈1% of
placebo and 0.5% of  xxxd3385xxx  recipients in the admiral, gusto iv-acs and
target clinical trials. severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 × 109/l)
was observed in 0.9–2% of patients who received  xxxd53xxx , 0.04% and 1.3% of
placebo recipients and 0.1% of  xxxd3385xxx  recipients. 2.1% of patients treated with
 xxxd53xxx  were identified as having pseudothrombocytopenia in pooled data from
the capture, epic, epilog and epistent trials compared with 0.6% of
patients who received placebo.
in the assent-3 trial, rates of major and minor bleeding were significantly
higher in patients receiving  xxxd53xxx  plus  xxxd3308xxx  than in those receiving
 xxxd3308xxx  alone or plus enoxaparin. similarly, in gusto-v rates of major and
minor bleeding were significantly higher in patients receiving  xxxd53xxx  plus
reteplase than in those receiving reteplase alone. in both studies, the rates of
intracranial haemorrhage were similar for each treatment group. no cases of
anaphylactic, allergic or other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in
500 patients enrolled in the reopro readministration registry.
pharmacoeconomic
considerations

cumulative treatment costs from a prospectively defined subset of patients in the
us who participated in the epistent study at 1 year were significantly higher in
both the stent plus  xxxd53xxx  (by $us932) and angioplasty plus  xxxd53xxx 
($us581) groups than in the stent plus placebo group, primarily because of the
acquisition cost of  xxxd53xxx .
the addition of  xxxd53xxx  to stenting also significantly increased the estimated
mean costs per patient after 6 months’ treatment when results of the epistent
trial were extrapolated to a european setting based on an economic evaluation
from the belgian netherlands stent (benestent)-ii study.
cost savings associated with  xxxd53xxx  in a prospectively defined economic
substudy of epilog were for the most part attributed to a reduced requirement
for repeat revascularisation, bailout stenting and shorter hospital stays. over a
6-month follow-up period, hospitalisation costs remained increased in the  xxxd53xxx  groups because of an increase in the number of patients undergoing
nonurgent revascularisation.
increased costs in the  xxxd53xxx  group were primarily because of drug
acquisition costs.
two nonrandomised studies (based in the us and netherlands) showed a
reduced incidence of ischaemic complications with  xxxd53xxx  and stenting;
however, overall treatment costs were similar or increased in these patients
compared with those who underwent only percutaneous coronary intervention.
among lower risk patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary revascularisation,  xxxd53xxx  has been associated with higher total in-hospital and

study.  xxxd53xxx  appeared most cost beneficial in high-risk patients in a retrospective cost analysis; the estimated cost to prevent one event was $us39 201
compared with $us74 047 for  xxxd3385xxx . patients treated with  xxxd53xxx  spent
fewer days in hospital than patients who received either  xxxd3385xxx  or  xxxd2017xxx 
according to a retrospective analysis.
an incremental cost of $us932, or cost-effectiveness ratio of $us6213 per
added life-year, was seen in the stent plus  xxxd53xxx  group compared with stent
and placebo in epistent. patients who received  xxxd53xxx  plus stent had an
incremental cost of $us581 and a cost-effectiveness ratio of $us5291 per added
life-year in comparison with the  xxxd53xxx  and angioplasty group. one
italian-based analysis has evaluated the cost effectiveness of  xxxd53xxx  based on
6-month results from the epilog, epic (not including patients who received
only  xxxd53xxx  bolus) and capture studies. cost-effectiveness ratios for
patients in the  xxxd53xxx  and placebo groups were l16.6 and  xxxg1978xxx .4 million lire
per event-free patient (approximately $us7543 and $us6998; 2002 values),
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of l34.3 ($us15 587) per
event avoided at 6 months after intervention.
dosage and
administration

the recommended dosage of  xxxd53xxx  is a 0.25 mg/kg iv bolus administered 10
to 60 minutes before the start of percutaneous coronary intervention, followed by
a continuous iv infusion of 0.125 mug/kg/min (up to a maximum of 10 mug/min) for
12 hours. for patients with refractory unstable angina pectoris in whom percutaneous coronary revascularisation is planned within 24 hours, the recommended
dosage is an iv bolus of 0.25 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 10 mug/min for 18
to 24 hours before the procedure and finishing 1 hour (us recommendation) or 12
hours (uk recommendation) after the procedure.  xxxd53xxx  should be used in
combination with aspirin and heparin.
 xxxd53xxx  is contraindicated in patients at high risk for bleeding complications or in whom bleeding complications would have serious consequences, those
requiring iv dextran and those with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
haemostatic parameters should be measured before administration. caution is
required in patients receiving other drugs that affect haemostasis. infusion of
 xxxd53xxx  and heparin should be stopped if uncontrollable serious bleeding
occurs or if emergency surgery is required.
to reduce the risk of bleeding, careful femoral artery access site care, use of a
low-dose, bodyweight-adjusted regimen of heparin, discontinuation of heparin
immediately after the procedure, early removal of the arterial sheath and careful
patient management are recommended.
platelet counts should be monitored before and during treatment. if the platelet
count decreases by ≥25% and to <100 × 109/l,  xxxd53xxx  should be discontinued
and appropriate treatment initiated.

1. introduction
in 2000, ischaemic heart disease was one of the
most significant contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide, responsible for an estimated
12.4% of all deaths.[1] an estimated 1.3 million
coronary revascularisation procedures were performed in the us in 1998[2] and 20 500 in the uk in
1996.[3] the acute coronary syndromes (acs) are a
group of clinical conditions including unstable angina pectoris (uap), non-st-segment elevation myocardial infarction (mi), st-segment elevation mi
and sudden ischaemic death.[4] among these, uap
and mi without st-segment elevation are among the
most commonly observed clinical manifestations.[5]
platelet aggregation is a key step in thrombus
formation both on the ruptured atherosclerotic
plaque and after percutaneous coronary intervention. a conformational change in glycoprotein iib/
iiia (gp iib/iiia) results from the activation of a
specific platelet membrane receptor. gp iib/iiia
then becomes an active receptor for fibrinogen-mediated platelet aggregation. at high shear stress, von
willebrand factor also binds to gp iib/iiia and
contributes to platelet aggregation (see figure 1).[6]
medical management of acs often involves
revascularisation of the underlying disease process
with either percutaneous coronary intervention or
coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) in conjunction with pharmacological therapy. as the gp iib/
iiia receptor is critical to the process of thrombus
formation, it is an attractive target for pharmacological intervention.
 xxxd53xxx  (reopro®1), a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody fab (fragment antigen
binding) fragment which inhibits platelet aggregation through antagonism of gp iib/iiia, was first
reviewed in drugs in 1994,[7] and an update was
subsequently published in 1998.[8] a further review
detailing the pharmacoeconomics of its use in percu1

taneous coronary revascularisation was published in
pharmacoeconomics in 1999.[9] this review primarily provides an update on the therapeutic use of
 xxxd53xxx  in patients with ischaemic heart disease
undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularisation, and also reviews its use in patients without
early revascularisation and in mi.
2. overview of pharmacology
the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
properties of  xxxd53xxx  have been reviewed extensively elsewhere[7,8] and are summarised in table i.
this section provides an overview of the in vitro and
ex vivo properties of the drug, with emphasis on
recently published reports of the effect of various
platelet gp iib/iiia antagonists or their combination
with fibrinolytic therapy on platelet function.
2.1 inhibition of platelet aggregation

the effect of  xxxd53xxx  on platelet function in ex
vivo studies was primarily measured by inhibition of
 xxxd80xxx  (adp)- or 11-amino acid
 xxxg746xxx -activating peptide (trap)-induced platelet aggregation. a schematic representation of the factors involved in platelet aggregation
and the points of action of various antithrombotic
and anticoagulant drugs (including  xxxd53xxx ) is
presented in figure 1.
inhibition of platelet aggregation is correlated
with the degree of gp iib/iiia receptor blockade.[8]
an intravenous (iv) bolus of  xxxd53xxx  0.25 mg/kg
blocks >80% of gp iib/iiia receptors and produces
the maximum antiplatelet effect (>80% inhibition of
adp-induced platelet aggregation)  xxxd1891xxx  minutes
after treatment initiation.[28] continuous infusion
(0.125 mug/kg/min or 10 mug/min) after the bolus
maintains near maximal platelet inhibition.[8]

ed in the degree of platelet inhibition in patients
undergoing revascularisation.[11-14]
however, platelet aggregation in response to
trap (25 mumol/l) was inhibited to a lesser extent
than that induced by adp (20 mumol/l) in patients
treated with  xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus then 10
mug/min for 12 hours) undergoing coronary stenting.
in vitro, trap- and adp-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited in a concentration-dependent
manner when platelets were incubated with  xxxd53xxx  1–100 mg/l.[15]
in addition to inhibiting platelet aggregation, recent in vitro data suggests that  xxxd53xxx  may also
facilitate the dispersal of newly formed platelet aggregates.[29] adp-induced aggregation of platelets
from healthy, non-medicated volunteers was completely reversed by concentrations of  xxxd53xxx 
which produced partial displacement of platelet
bound fibrinogen. the ability of  xxxd53xxx  to dis© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

perse aggregates was inversely proportional to the
interval between aggregation and addition of  xxxd53xxx , and the concentration of adp. this suggests
that only newly-formed aggregates whose formation
does not involve granule secretion are susceptible to
dissaggregation by  xxxd53xxx  (trap-induced
platelet aggregation was not reversed by  xxxd53xxx ).[29]
2.1.1 comparison with other platelet glycoprotein
iib/iiia antagonists

ex vivo, administration of  xxxd53xxx  to patients
undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularisation
has generally shown equivalent inhibition of platelet
aggregation in response to adp or trap to that of
 xxxd3385xxx  or  xxxd2017xxx  (table ii), although some
exceptions exist and dosage regimens of  xxxd3385xxx 
and  xxxd2017xxx  varied between some studies.
at 2 hours post-infusion, all three drugs inhibited
trap-induced platelet aggregation by >80% in

small, randomised trials (table ii). inhibition with
 xxxd2017xxx  was significantly greater than with
either  xxxd53xxx  or  xxxd3385xxx  at the end of the infusion in a trial in patients with uap[31] and significantly less (at 2 hours) than with these two drugs in
another study in patients with acs, reported as an
abstract.[30]  xxxd53xxx  (p = 0.041) and  xxxd2017xxx 
(p = 0.002) both produced greater inhibition at patient discharge than  xxxd3385xxx  in the trial in patients
with uap.[31] where used, the adp assay produced
generally similar results (table ii).
any differences, however, may relate to study
design rather than any true disparaties in the magnitude of ex vivo inhibitory effect, which, in the case
of  xxxd2017xxx , is influenced by the anticoagulant
used in the assay.[33] some studies used hirudin[32] or
p-pack[31] rather than citrate as an anticoagulant
which gives misleading results for  xxxd2017xxx ; one
trial showing inferior results for  xxxd2017xxx  did not
state which aggregatory agent was used.[30] also, the
seemingly lower inhibitory effect of  xxxd3385xxx  in one
trial[31] may have resulted from the extended delivery time of the  xxxd3385xxx  bolus (30 minutes) com© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

pared to that used in other trials (≤3 minutes).[30,31]
lastly, heparin dosages varied among the three
treatment arms.[31,32]
recovery of platelet aggregatory function is
delayed after cessation of  xxxd53xxx  therapy, compared with  xxxd2017xxx  or  xxxd3385xxx .[31,32]
continuous platelet inhibition was achieved
when full-dose  xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus then
0.125 mug/kg/min iv infusion for 12 hours) was
given to 50 patients with uap or acute mi scheduled to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention
within 14 days who were already receiving treatment with either full-dose  xxxd3385xxx  (0.4 mug/kg/min
for 30 minutes then 0.1 mug/kg/min over 20–24
hours) or  xxxd2017xxx  (180 mug/kg bolus then 2.0 mug/
kg/min iv infusion over 20–24 hours).[34] platelet
inhibition (adp- [20 mumol/l] and trap- [15 mumol/
l] stimulated) following administration of  xxxd53xxx  was equivalent to or greater than that seen
when the drugs were given alone in this nonrandomised trial.
shear-force mediated platelet adhesion is also
inhibited by the glycoprotein iib/iiia antagonists. in

of 43, 430 and 5781nm, respectively.[35]
2.1.2 in combination with fibrinolytic therapy

in patients with acute mi, high levels of platelet
aggregation and activation may limit the success of
fibrinolytic therapy.[17,36]
platelet aggregation was evaluated in the dosefinding timi-14 trial (see section 3.2.3 for further
study details) in 51 patients with acute mi who
received either full-dose  xxxg1766xxx  or reteplase alone,
or a reduced dose of the fibrinolytic drug with fulldose  xxxd53xxx .[17] adp-induced platelet aggregation was increased relative to baseline at 90 minutes
© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

following fibrinolytic therapy (p = 0.02). no differences in platelet aggregation at 90 minutes or 24
hours were evident between patients who received
 xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus) with either reduced
dosages of reteplase (a 5u bolus and either 5 or 10u
bolus) or  xxxg1766xxx  (dose range 35–65mg). all patients receiving combination  xxxd53xxx /fibrinolytic
therapy achieved >80% inhibition of platelet aggregation at 90 minutes and this was sustained for ≥24
hours after initiation of  xxxd53xxx  treatment.[17]
the effect of combination therapy with  xxxd53xxx , reteplase and ticlopidine on platelet function
and gp iib/iiia blockade was also evaluated in 46
patients with mi as part of the speed trial (see
section 3.2.2 for further study details).[36] the degree
of gp iib/iiia blockade (measured by inhibition of
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

 xxxd53xxx 

fibrinogen binding) was inversely correlated to
 xxxd53xxx  binding (r = –0.72; p < 0.0001). in addition, adp-induced platelet aggregation was maximally inhibited  xxxd1891xxx  minutes and recovered within
48 hours, although the majority of gp iib/iiia receptors were still blocked with  xxxd53xxx . reteplase
treatment alone did not increase platelet aggregation.  xxxd53xxx  binding was not influenced by concomitant administration of reteplase as indicated by
measures of  xxxg2049xxx  expression, fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation. however, platelet inhibition achieved with  xxxd53xxx  therapy during the
first 24 hours was maintained by additional treatment with ticlopidine (p < 0.001 vs without
ticlopidine for all timepoints).[36]
2.2 effect on measures of thrombosis

the effects of  xxxd53xxx  on glycoprotein iib/iiia
are well documented; however recent ex vivo data
using monocytes from healthy volunteers suggest
that  xxxd53xxx  may also directly modulate the coagulation cascade through binding to the leucocyte
integrin  xxxg1206xxx   xxxg1209xxx .[37] binding of various ligands including fibrinogen and  xxxg741xxx  to
 xxxg1206xxx   xxxg1209xxx  was inhibited by  xxxd53xxx  (10 mug/ml) in
vitro. this in turn resulted in the impairment of the
conversion of  xxxg741xxx  to xa and of fibrinogenmediated cell aggregation. the clinical relevance of
these anti-leucocyte and anticoagulative effects of
 xxxd53xxx  are unclear; however, these data extend
the molecular understanding of  xxxd53xxx  beyond
the blockade of glycoprotein iib/iiia.[37]
treatment with  xxxd53xxx  results in a significant
decrease in thrombus formation which is independent of heparin administration. the addition of
standard-dose  xxxd53xxx  to heparin and aspirin therapy showed significant decreases in thrombin generation (despite increased thrombin generation and
activity in the  xxxd53xxx  group at baseline) in 32
consecutive patients undergoing revascularisation
for acs in a nonrandomised study.[38] a significant

increase in the activated clotting time (act) and
decrease in prothrombin fragment f1.2 before and
during coronary intervention were seen in patients
treated with heparin and either  xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/
kg bolus then 0.125 mug/kg/min iv infusion for 12
hours)[39,40] or  xxxd3385xxx  (10 mug/kg over 3 minutes,
then 0.15 mug/kg/min).[39] however, in the gusto
iv-acs trial, prothrombin activation was unaffected in 167 patients with acs not undergoing revascularisation who received  xxxd53xxx  (see section
3.5 for further study details).[41]
when porcine aortic segments were perfused
with blood from 23 patients with uap who had
received  xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus followed by
an iv infusion 10 mug/min for 12 hours, ex vivo
thrombus formation was reduced by 58% (p < 0.001
vs baseline) and this was not further reduced following treatment with heparin.[42]
similarly, in 14 patients receiving  xxxd53xxx 
(0.25 mg/kg bolus before angioplasty then 10 mug/
min iv infusion for 12 hours) in combination with
ticlopidine (500mg 12–36 hours before angioplasty
then 250mg twice daily for 30 days), in vitro mural
thrombosis measured 3 days following angioplasty
was reduced by approximately 50% compared with
baseline values; treatment with  xxxd53xxx  alone inhibited mural thrombus formation for 1 day. however, while the number of circulating platelet-neutrophil aggregates was decreased with  xxxd53xxx 
therapy,  xxxg2049xxx -mediated leucocyte adhesion
was significantly increased.[23]
in the admiral study, 23 patients with acute
mi receiving  xxxd53xxx  (see section 3.2.1 for further study details) showed a 65% reduction in platelet aggregate size (p = 0.0007) and a 63% decrease
in the viscoelastic properties (p = 0.0001) compared
with placebo. this was independent of previous
heparin administration. these changes to the architecture of platelet-rich clots may contribute to the
improved artery patency observed in patients treated
with  xxxd53xxx .[43]
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

1134

2.3 other effects

 xxxd53xxx  prevents the adhesion and migration
of smooth muscle cells via inhibition of the  xxxg2422xxx  integrin receptor[44,45] and through this
mechanism  xxxd53xxx  may also prevent other  xxxg2422xxx -mediated effects such as thrombin generation and clot formation (see section 2.2).
for example, the chemotactic and invasive potential of human coronary smooth muscle cells in
vitro was significantly inhibited by the addition of
 xxxd53xxx  24 hours prior to and during smooth
muscle cell migration (mean concentration required
to achieve 50% inhibition [ic50] = 33.0 mg/l for
chemotaxis and 0.5 mg/l for invasion).[46] migration was similarly inhibited if  xxxd53xxx  was administered only during migration (ic50 = 32.6 mg/l),
although the drug affected invasion to a lesser extent
in this phase.[46]
2.4 pharmacokinetic properties

 xxxd53xxx  binds rapidly to platelets following
iv administration and the unbound drug is rapidly
cleared from the plasma. it has an initial half-life of
>10 minutes and a second phase half-life of about 30
minutes. following iv infusion, free plasma concentrations decline rapidly for 6 hours; the decline is
slower thereafter.[28] less than 4% of the total dose
was present as free plasma antibody after 2 hours.[8]
platelet function generally recovers within 48
hours, although platelet-bound  xxxd53xxx  is still
detectable 15 days or more after administration in a
platelet-bound state.  xxxd53xxx  is continually redistributed among circulating platelets, including newly released cells.[8] thus, the drug is uniformly distributed on all platelets and there is no drug-free
platelet population.

3. therapeutic use in percutaneous
coronary intervention
at the time of the previous review in drugs,[8]
large, well designed studies showed that administration of  xxxd53xxx  (as an adjunct to heparin and
aspirin) during percutaneous coronary revascularisation significantly reduced the incidence of ischaemic complications occurring in the 30 days
after the procedure. significant benefit, particularly
in the incidence of mi, was still evident at 6 months
in two of the four major trials.[47-50]
 xxxd53xxx  was particularly effective in high-risk
patients with acute mi and uap. subsequent studies
which have investigated the therapeutic use of
 xxxd53xxx  in these patient groups alone are described in sections 3.3 and 3.4. moreover,  xxxd53xxx  showed additive benefits to coronary stenting.
preliminary data also suggested that  xxxd53xxx  may
improve coronary blood flow after mi, as well as
achieving reperfusion in conjunction with reduced
doses of fibrinolytic agents,[8] and new data in this
area are presented in sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3.
unless otherwise specified,  xxxd53xxx  was administered as a 0.25 mg/kg bolus followed by a
0.125 mug/kg/min iv infusion (up to a maximum of
10 mug/min) for 12 hours. all patients also received
aspirin (usually 150–325mg) and weight-adjusted
heparin; a lower dose of heparin was generally given
to patients receiving either  xxxd53xxx  or a fibrinolytic agent.
the primary endpoint in large, randomised, multicentre trials was generally a composite of death,
mi and target-vessel revascularisation and/or stroke
at 30 days or 6 months. in studies involving patients
with acute mi who received  xxxd53xxx  and fibrinolytic therapy, primary endpoints were the time to
reperfusion and timi blood flow rates. analyses
were intent-to-treat. a summary of the acronyms
used to describe the major trials in this area is

3.1 in general patient populations

the use of  xxxd53xxx  in reducing the incidence
of mi in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
intervention had been well established at the time of
the previous review.[8] one large study (target)
has subsequently investigated the comparative efficacies of the platelet gp iib/iiia antagonists  xxxd53xxx  and  xxxd3385xxx  in patients without st-segment
elevation scheduled to undergo elective or urgent
coronary stenting or cabg.[51] one-year follow-up
data from the previously reported epistent[52] and
epilog[53] studies are also presented in this section
(table iv).
3.1.1 the target study

the multicentre target study randomised patients in a double-blind fashion to receive either
 xxxd53xxx  (n = 2411) or  xxxd3385xxx  (10 mug/kg bolus
then 0.15 mug/kg/min iv infusion for 18–24 hours; n
= 2398) prior to coronary revascularisation.[51] all
patients were also treated with aspirin and
clopidogrel after revascularisation.

curred in 6.0% and 7.6% of patients who received
 xxxd53xxx  or  xxxd3385xxx , respectively (p = 0.038)
[figure 2]. the larger beneficial effect of  xxxd53xxx 
was predominantly due to a greater number of mi
events in patients treated with  xxxd3385xxx  (6.9% vs
5.4% with  xxxd53xxx ; p = 0.04).[51] this was also
observed when the analysis was restricted to patients
with acs (9.3% vs 6.3%; p = 0.002).[54]
at 6-months the incidence of death, repeat revascularisation and the combined endpoint were similar
between treatment groups, but the incidence of mi
remained significantly lower in patients who received  xxxd53xxx  compared to those who received
 xxxd3385xxx  (figure 2).[55] in patients with acs,  xxxd53xxx  showed significantly greater efficacy than  xxxd3385xxx  in the combined endpoint (14.7% vs 17.2%; p
= 0.05). the incidence of mi and death/mi was
significantly lower in acs patients who received
 xxxd53xxx  than those who received  xxxd3385xxx  (7.2%
vs 9.8% and 8.1% vs 10.4%, respectively; p = 0.013
and 0.03).[54,55]

one-year outcomes have been reported from the
two large randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled epistent and epilog trials.[53,57] epilog
included patients of all risk levels (excluding patients with acute ischaemic syndromes) undergoing
elective or urgent revascularisation primarily with
balloon angioplasty (85%);[48] epistent included
all patients with ischaemic heart disease requiring
elective or urgent intervention.[50] previously reported 30-day outcomes from these studies demonstrated that the beneficial effect of  xxxd53xxx  in highrisk patients shown in epic was extended to a
patient population with different risk levels; an approximate 50–55% reduction in ischaemic complications was seen compared with placebo.[48,50]

 xxxd53xxx 

in patients with diabetes mellitus

patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased
risk of ischaemic complications following percutaneous revascularisation; in addition, mortality rates
are approximately twice those in patients without
diabetes mellitus.[58] in the epilog study,  xxxd53xxx  plus standard-dose heparin was associated
with a reduction in death or mi (4.1% vs 14.8%), but
not target-vessel revascularisation (19.1% vs
15.5%) compared with placebo at 6 months in patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.[59] the effect of treatment
with  xxxd53xxx  on mortality in a pooled analysis of
patients with diabetes mellitus enrolled in the epic,
epilog and epistent trials is presented in section 3.3.1. this section reports results from a prospectively defined subset of patients enrolled in the
epistent study.[60,61]
one hundred and seventy-three patients with diabetes mellitus were randomised to receive stent plus
placebo, 162 to stent and  xxxd53xxx  and 156 to
angioplasty with  xxxd53xxx .[61]  xxxd53xxx  showed
greater efficacy than placebo in combination with
stenting; a significant reduction was observed in the
incidence of the composite endpoint of death, mi or

target-vessel revascularisation at 6 months (13.0%
vs 25.2%; p = 0.005), but not the separate endpoints
of death or mi (0.6% vs 1.7% and 6.2% vs 11.0%,
respectively) [figure 3]. an approximate 50% reduction in target vessel revascularisation with stent plus
 xxxd53xxx  compared with stent plus placebo was
also seen (8.1% vs 16.6%; p = 0.021). the combination of stenting and  xxxd53xxx  in patients with diabetes mellitus also resulted in significantly decreased rates of death, mi and target vessel revascularisation compared with angioplasty plus
 xxxd53xxx . when the analysis was restricted to include only patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n =
250), the composite event rates for patients treated
with stent- xxxd53xxx  and stent-placebo were 14.6%
and 26.1%, respectively (p = 0.026). factors which
were significant predictors of the composite endpoint at 6 months were stenting with  xxxd53xxx  (p =
0.008), hypertension (p = 0.015), recent history of
smoking (p = 0.006), prior percutaneous coronary
intervention (p = 0.003) and type b2 or c lesions (p
= 0.029). at 1 year, mortality rates were 4.1% for

the beneficial effects of treatment with  xxxd53xxx  have been maintained for up to 1 year, with a
significantly lower incidence of mi, target-vessel
revascularisation and composite of death, mi and
target-vessel revascularisation compared with placebo (table iv).[53,57] this effect was consistent across
a range of subgroups including age, sex, bodyweight
or indication for revascularisation.[53] factors independently associated with improved survival at 1
year in multivariate analysis in epistent were use
of  xxxd53xxx  in combination with stenting (versus
placebo and stenting alone) and preprocedural percentage diameter stenosis; whereas those associated
with worse survival were previous congestive heart
failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, age >70 years and
postprocedural timi grade 0 flow (all p < 0.05).[57]

stent-placebo and 1.2% for stent- xxxd53xxx  (p =
0.11). patients receiving angioplasty- xxxd53xxx  had
a 1-year mortality rate of 2.6%.[61]
the incidences of the 30-day or 6-month composite secondary endpoint of death, mi or urgent
target-vessel revascularisation were not significantly different between groups of women with diabetes
mellitus (n = 143) who received stenting with placebo or  xxxd53xxx , or angioplasty with  xxxd53xxx .[60]
however, stenting plus  xxxd53xxx  was more effective than stenting plus placebo at reducing the incidence of the composite endpoint of death, mi or
target-vessel revascularisation (34.5% vs 13.3%; p =
0.02); angioplasty plus  xxxd53xxx  was similarly effective (28.9%). the incidence of target-vessel
revascularisation was similar between groups at 30
days, but significantly fewer patients receiving
 xxxd53xxx  and stent required target-vessel revascularisation at 6 months (2.3% vs 15.7% and 23.1%; p
≤ 0.03) and 1 year (4.5% vs 21.1% and 26.7%; p ≤
0.02) than either patients who received placebo and
stent or angioplasty plus  xxxd53xxx .[60]
3.2 in acute myocardial infarction

at the time of the previous review,  xxxd53xxx 
was reported to produce a significant reduction in
the incidence of acute ischaemic complications
(death, reinfarction or urgent target-vessel revascularisation) in patients with acute mi undergoing
primary percutaneous revascularisation (relative reduction 48% compared with placebo).[62] subsequent large randomised studies which have investigated the use of  xxxd53xxx  in this indication are
presented in table v.
in addition, preliminary results had been reported
from the timi-14 trial, which suggested that adequate reperfusion was achieved when  xxxd53xxx 
was combined with a reduced dosage of a fibrinolytic drug.[8] this has since been expanded upon and
recent studies in this area are presented in the following sections. patients involved in these studies

five randomised comparative studies (admiral,[63]

stopami,[65]
[66]
[67]
stopami-2, and isar-2 ; table v) have investigated the use of  xxxd53xxx  in combination with
stent placement in patients with acute mi. both
stopami and admiral studies reported that
patients receiving  xxxd53xxx  plus stent showed a
reduced requirement for urgent repeat revascularisation leading to a reduction in the composite endpoint
compared to either fibrinolytic therapy or stent
alone. the use of  xxxd53xxx  plus stent is also supported by the findings to the stopami-2 study in
which patients receiving  xxxd53xxx  plus stent showed a greater myocardial salvage index than those
receiving  xxxd53xxx  plus  xxxg1766xxx . results of the
cadillac study suggest that stent plus  xxxd53xxx , angioplasty plus  xxxd53xxx  and stent alone
each leads to significantly better outcomes at 30
days compared to angioplasty alone. as in
stopami and admiral, the differences in the
rates of revascularisation of the target vessel between treatment groups may account for the difference in the composite endpoint in cadillac.
patients receiving stent plus  xxxd53xxx  showed a
significantly lower rate of revascularisation than
those receiving angioplasty either alone or in combination with  xxxd53xxx .
the beneficial effects of using  xxxd53xxx  with
stent placement in patients with acute mi compared
to stent alone were demonstrated in the double-blind
admiral study (table v[63]). after 30 days, the
incidence of the composite endpoint was significantly lower in patients receiving stent plus  xxxd53xxx  than in those receiving stent plus placebo
(6.0% vs 14.6%, p = 0.01). this difference in the
primary endpoint was largely due to a requirement
for significantly fewer target vessel revascularisations in patients receiving  xxxd53xxx  than those

receiving placebo (1.3% vs 6.6%, p = 0.02). thus,
patients receiving  xxxd53xxx  plus stenting showed
relative risk reductions of 59% for the composite
endpoint at 30 days and this was maintained at 6
months (53%, p = 0.02) compared to placebo.[63]
furthermore, in patients with diabetes mellitus,
treatment with  xxxd53xxx  resulted in a significant
reduction in 6-month mortality (0% vs 16.7%; p =

(20.7% vs 50.0%; p = 0.02) compared to placebo.[63]

blood flow was greater in patients who received
 xxxd53xxx  than in placebo recipients immediately
following revascularisation (timi grade 3 flow
achieved in 95.1% vs 86.7% of patients; p = 0.04).
this difference remained at 6 months with 94.3%
and 82.8% of patients who received  xxxd53xxx  or
placebo achieving timi grade 3 blood flow. timi
grade 3 blood flow was a strong predictor of clinical
outcomes at both day 30 and 6 months; 7.4% of
patients with grade 3 blood flow experienced either
death, reinfarction or urgent revascularisation compared with 35.3% of patients with blood flow grades
0–2 (p < 0.001).

the large cadillac study (table v[64]) endorsed the use of stent versus angioplasty. in this
study, both primary objectives were met; stenting
alone was superior to percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty (ptca) and stenting alone
was not inferior to ptca plus  xxxd53xxx  (table v).
the incidence of mace at 30 days was significantly higher in patients receiving angioplasty alone,
compared to patients receiving angioplasty plus
 xxxd53xxx  (8.3% vs 4.8%, p < 0.02); the difference
in mace between angioplasty and stent plus  xxxd53xxx  also approached statistical significance at 30
days (8.3% vs 4.4%, p = 0.08).[64] these differences
were largely due to the increased rates of target
vessel revascularisation required by patients undergoing angioplasty. significantly fewer patients receiving  xxxd53xxx  plus stent required revascularisation of the ischaemic target vessel than those undergoing angioplasty either alone (1.6% vs 5.6%, p <
0.001) or plus  xxxd53xxx  (1.6% vs 3.4%, p < 0.05).
there was no statistical difference between patients
undergoing stent alone and those undergoing stent
plus  xxxd53xxx , either in the composite endpoint at
30 days (5.7% vs 4.4%) or in the rates or target
vessel revascularisation (1.6% vs 3.2%, p = 0.08).[64]
however, cadillac differed from admiral[63]
and isar-2[67] in that it was not powered to examine
differences between stent alone and stent plus  xxxd53xxx , but to examine differences between angioplasty plus  xxxd53xxx  and early discharge, and
angioplasty plus placebo. in admiral,[63]  xxxd53xxx  was administered either before arrival at the
hospital or in the emergency department, the intensive care unit or in the catheterisation laboratory and
always before sheath insertion and coronary angiography; in cadillac,  xxxd53xxx  was administered
only in the catheterisation laboratory.[64] also, patient selection differed between cadillac (where
patients lacked many high-risk characteristics) and
admiral. this is evidenced by the difference in
the incidence of the primary composite endpoint in

patients receiving stent plus placebo in these two
trials (admiral 14.6% vs cadillac 5.7%).
six months after treatment in cadillac, the
effect of stent placement remained evident. the
composite endpoint (the primary endpoint) was significantly lower in patients with stent either with
 xxxd53xxx  or alone compared to those patients undergoing angioplasty (table v).[64] the incidence of
mace and target vessel revascularisation was not
statistically different between patients undergoing
stent alone and those receiving stent plus  xxxd53xxx 
(11.5% vs 10.2% and 8.9% vs 5.7%).
cadillac study subgroup analyses indicate
that stenting lowered the rate of target-vessel revascularisation and mace compared to ptca in patients with diabetes mellitus.[68] elderly patients
(aged ≥75 years) showed significantly higher mortality and rates of mace than nonelderly patients,
irrespective of treatment at 30 days, 6 months and 1
year.[69] the number of patients achieving timi
grade 3 blood flow after intervention was similar
between all four groups (94.5–96.9%).[64]
three smaller studies also support the use of
 xxxd53xxx  plus stent in patients with acute mi (table
v). in the prospective isar-2 study[67] cardiacrelated events and event-free survival were significantly higher in patients receiving heparin plus stent
compared to those receiving  xxxd53xxx  plus stent
after 30 days (absolute reduction in cardiac events of
5.5%; p < 0.05). the between-group difference in
event-free survival was maintained at 1-year but did
not reach statistical significance. the myocardial
salvage index (percentage of the left ventricle that
was salvaged divided by the percentage compromised by the initial perfusion defect), the primary
endpoint in stopami, was significantly greater
with stent plus  xxxd53xxx  than  xxxg1766xxx  alone (0.57
vs 0.26; p < 0.001).[65] finally, in the nonblind
randomised stopami-2 study, a reperfusion strategy with stent plus  xxxd53xxx  produced a higher
myocardial salvage index than a combination of

3.2.2 in combination with fibrinolytic therapy

reperfusion with fibrinolytic therapy, aspirin and
heparin is hindered by high reocclusion rates and
dose-limiting intracranial haemorrhage. reocclusion following initial reperfusion occurs in 5–15%
of patients and is associated with increased mortality.[70] in addition, approximately 50% of patients
present more than 12 hours after the onset of symptoms, do not show st-segment elevation or are at
increased risk for bleeding and, therefore, are not
suitable for fibrinolytic therapy.
at the time of the previous review, preliminary
results from the timi-14 trial suggested that  xxxd53xxx  was effective in combination with a reduced
dose of a fibrinolytic agent, improving blood flow

rates in patients with acute mi.[71] the effect of
 xxxd53xxx  in combination with a reduced-dose fibrinolytic on the incidence of various cardiac events
had only been investigated in dose-finding studies.
this has since been an area of considerable interest
and recent randomised studies have evaluated the
therapeutic use of  xxxd53xxx  in combination with
reduced-dose  xxxd3308xxx ,[72] reduced- or full-dose
reteplase[73-75] or  xxxg1766xxx [75] compared with the use
of a full-dose fibrinolytic agent alone (table vi).
an earlier study showed similar ischaemic outcomes in patients who received either  xxxd53xxx 
therapy or  xxxd53xxx  in combination with a reduced
dose of reteplase (speed).[74] however, recent
large multicentre, nonblind studies have shown
higher efficacy of  xxxd53xxx  in combination with
either a reduced dose of  xxxd3308xxx  or reteplase
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

than with the full-dose fibrinolytic agent alone.
there may also be an increased propensity for
bleeding with combined  xxxd53xxx  plus fibrinolytic
therapy relative to fibrinolytic therapy alone and this
is discussed in greater detail in section 4.2.
in the assent-3 study, patients were randomised within 6 hours of onset of symptoms to receive
 xxxd3308xxx  30–50mg (depending on bodyweight)
with enoxaparin (30mg iv followed by 1 mg/kg
subcutaneously, then subcutaneously every 12 hours
up to discharge, revascularisation or for a total of 7
days; n = 2040), unfractionated heparin (60 u/kg
bolus then 12 u/kg/h to maintain activated partial
thromboplastin time (aptt) of 50–70 seconds, then
as needed; n = 2038) or  xxxd53xxx  (n = 2017).[72]
patients treated with  xxxd53xxx  received a reduced
weight-adjusted dose of  xxxd3308xxx  (range
15–25mg).
at 30 days, the primary efficacy endpoint of
mortality, in-hospital reinfarction or in-hospital
refractory ischaemia was reduced to a significant
extent (≈30%) in patients who received either  xxxd53xxx  or enoxaparin compared with unfractionated
heparin (table vi).[72] in addition, this was seen for
the combined endpoint which also included in-hospital intracranial haemorrhage or in-hospital major
bleeds for the three treatment groups (14.2% vs
13.8% vs 17.0%, respectively; p = 0.0081), in-hospital reinfarction (2.2% vs 2.7% vs 4.2%; p =
0.0009) and in-hospital refractory ischaemia (3.2%
vs 4.6% vs 6.5%; p < 0.0001), although mortality
did not differ significantly (6.6% vs 5.4% vs 6.0%).
both enoxaparin and  xxxd53xxx  showed greater efficacy than unfractionated heparin on the overall
event rate and in various subgroups (males, age ≤75
years, patients without diabetes mellitus and in all
infarct locations), but showed similar efficacy in
female patients, those aged over 75 years and patients with diabetes mellitus.[72]
the large gusto-v study investigated the comparative efficacy of reteplase versus half-dose

reteplase with  xxxd53xxx .[73] patients received either
full-dose reteplase alone (n = 8260) or combination
 xxxd53xxx  plus half-dose reteplase (n = 8328) within
6 hours of presentation with an acute st-segment
elevation mi. all-cause mortality at 30 days, the
primary endpoint, was similar between the two
groups (5.9% vs 5.6%; table vi) and did not differ
with sex, age (greater or less than 75 years), the
presence of diabetes mellitus, location of mi or time
to treatment. early percutaneous coronary intervention (within 6 hours) was performed more often in
the reteplase than combination group (8.6% vs
5.6%; p < 0.0001); this difference remained after 7
days (27.9% vs 25.4%; p < 0.0001). in addition, the
composite of death, reinfarction or urgent percutaneous revascularisation was lower in the  xxxd53xxx 
and reteplase group than in the group receiving
reteplase alone (16.2% vs 20.6%; p < 0.0001).[73]
3.2.3 reperfusion during acute
myocardial infarction

the use of  xxxd53xxx  alone or in combination
with fibrinolytic therapy on reperfusion during acute
mi has been investigated in the timi-14,[76,77]
speed[74] and grape trials.[78] at the time of the
previous review only preliminary results were available; these suggested that  xxxd53xxx  together with
 xxxg1766xxx  or streptokinase allowed reperfusion to be
achieved with reduced doses of the fibrinolytic
drug.[8] myocardial perfusion was evaluated according to timi myocardial perfusion grade.
the timi-14 trial compared therapy with  xxxg1766xxx  or reteplase, either with or without concomitant  xxxd53xxx  and/or revascularisation.[79] the  xxxg1766xxx  arm consisted of two phases: dose-finding (n
= 677) and dose-confirmation (n = 888).[76] during
the dose-finding phase, patients with acute mi of
<12 hours’ duration were randomised to receive a
standard dose of  xxxg1766xxx  (15mg bolus followed by
an initial infusion of 0.75 mg/kg up to 50mg over 30
minutes, then 0.50 mg/kg up to 35mg over 60 minutes),  xxxd53xxx  alone or in combination with a
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

reduced dose of streptokinase (total dose range
500–1500u × 103) or  xxxg1766xxx  (total dose 20 or
35mg). in the dose-confirmation phase, all patients
who received  xxxd53xxx  also received  xxxg1766xxx 
(15mg bolus then 35mg iv infusion over 60 minutes) and then either low-dose (60 u/kg bolus then 7
u/kg/h infusion [to target activated partial thromboplastin time of 50–70 seconds]) or very low-dose
heparin (30 u/kg bolus then 4 u/kg/h infusion).
coronary angiography was performed within 90
minutes of thrombolysis and before percutaneous
coronary revascularisation.[76]
at 90 minutes, timi grade 3 flow rates (the
primary efficacy endpoint) in patients who received
 xxxd53xxx  alone were lower than in those treated
with  xxxg1766xxx  alone (32% and 57%); flow rates were
significantly higher in the  xxxg1766xxx  50mg plus
 xxxd53xxx  group than in the group receiving  xxxg1766xxx  alone at both 60 minutes (72% vs 43%; p =
0.0009) and 90 minutes (77% vs 62%; p = 0.02).[76]

on timi grade 3 blood flow rates at 60 and 90 minutes after percutaneous coronary intervention. patients enrolled into the reteplase
(rtp) arm of the timi-14 trial were randomised to receive either
rtp alone (two 10u boluses given 30 minutes apart; n = 102), or
 xxxd53xxx  (abc; 0.25 mg/kg bolus then 0.125 mug/kg/min for 12
hours) in combination with rtp (either two 5u boluses, or a 10u
and 5u bolus given 30 minutes apart; n = 105 and 92, respectively).[77]

plus a reduced dose of reteplase (≈70–75%; figure
4). patients were randomised to receive either
reteplase given as two 10u boluses 30 minutes apart
(n = 102), or  xxxd53xxx  in combination with a
reduced dose of reteplase (either two 5u boluses [n
= 105] or 10u then 5u [n = 92]) in this arm of the
timi-14 trial.[77]
in the multicentre speed study, 294 patients
with acute mi were randomised to receive either
 xxxd53xxx  or reteplase alone (two 10u boluses 30
minutes apart), or  xxxd53xxx  together with varying
doses of reteplase (from 5–10u total) within 12
hours of onset of chest pain.[74] angiographic measurements were taken 60 and 90 minutes after initiation of reperfusion therapy. timi grade 3 flow
60–90 minutes after reperfusion treatment (the primary endpoint) was achieved in 27% of patients
treated with  xxxd53xxx  alone (n = 48) and was
highest in 60 patients who received  xxxd53xxx  and
reteplase 5 + 5u (62%; p = 0.001 vs  xxxd53xxx 
alone). overall, 30-day event rates were low and did
not differ appreciably between groups (table vi).[74]
in the second phase of this study, patients treated
with  xxxd53xxx  and reteplase 5 + 5u (n = 100)
showed similar rates of timi grade 3 flow 60–90
minutes after reperfusion treatment to patients who
received reteplase 10 + 10u alone (n = 98; achieved
in approximately 50% of patients in either
group).[74]
the grape study investigated the use of  xxxd53xxx  in 60 patients who showed onset of symptoms
within 6 hours and were to undergo angioplasty. no
significant difference was seen between the number
of patients who received  xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg
bolus then 10 mug/min iv infusion for 12 hours)
within 2.5 hours of onset of symptoms achieving
grade 2 and 3 flow rates and those who did not (33%
vs 46%). similarly, no differences were apparent
between patients who underwent angioplasty within
45 minutes of receiving  xxxd53xxx  and those who
did not.[78]
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

therefore, overall these results confirm earlier
results, which suggest that although the use of  xxxd53xxx  alone may not be effective in achieving
reperfusion,  xxxd53xxx  in combination with a reduced-dose fibrinolytic drug is as effective as a fulldose fibrinolytic drug alone.
3.3 pooled analyses

the largest of the pooled analyses reported in this
section involved >9000 randomised patients enrolled in the epic, epilog, epistent, isar-2,
rapport, eraser, admiral and cadillac
trials.[80] all studies were randomised, double-blind
and placebo-controlled except for isar-2 and
cadillac, where treatment was nonblind. patients received  xxxd53xxx  as a 0.25 mg/kg bolus 60
minutes before undergoing percutaneous coronary
intervention followed by a 12-hour infusion
(24-hour infusion in one of the arms in the eraser
study); all patients received aspirin and heparin.
follow-up was available for between 6 months and
3 years. the studies included in these analyses were
performed in a variety of patient types and used
differing heparin dosage regimens.
mortality at 1 year decreased with  xxxd53xxx 
treatment in all studies and mortality was also significantly reduced with  xxxd53xxx  plus stenting in
the epistent study (p = 0.043). overall, mortality
was reduced ≈30% with  xxxd53xxx  compared with
placebo (hazard ratio 0.71; p = 0.003). mortality was
reduced to a similar extent when  xxxd53xxx  was
combined with either angioplasty or stenting (both
≈30%).[80]
variables associated with increased mortality
identified by survival regression in patients who
received  xxxd53xxx  or placebo were increasing age
(p < 0.001), female sex (p = 0.047), low bodyweight
(p = 0.013), previous cabg (p < 0.001), history of
chronic heart failure (p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (p
= 0.004), history of cancer (p < 0.001), history of
hypertension (p < 0.001), no previous percutaneous

coronary intervention (p = 0.018), history of peripheral vascular disease (p < 0.001), no percutaneous
coronary intervention attempted (p = 0.003), multiple vessels attempted (p < 0.001) and treatment with
placebo (p = 0.011).[80]
in addition, several pooled analyses are available
from the epic, epilog and epistent trials.[81-84]
these showed that the treatment benefit with  xxxd53xxx  was similar between men and women, as indicated by 30-day and 6-month mortality outcomes
(composite death, mi or urgent revascularisation),
although increased rates of bleeding (both minor and
major) were observed in women (see also section
4.1.1).[82] a decrease in combined death/mi was
seen in patients with acs (uap with chest pain
within 48 hours, evolving mi or acute mi within 7
days) compared with stable angina pectoris (p =
0.05), but not in mortality alone (p = 0.63).[83]
there was no statistically significant difference
between the 30-day or 6-month composite endpoint
(death, mi or urgent revascularisation) rates between smokers (n = 2236) and nonsmokers (n =
4283) who received  xxxd53xxx . smoking was an
independent predictor of poor outcome at 30 days
(odds ratio 1.22; p = 0.03), but not at 6 months. in
contrast,  xxxd53xxx  therapy was predictive of improved outcome at both 30 days and 6 months (odds
ratios 0.52 and 0.59, respectively; both p <
0.001).[81]
mortality at 1 year was reduced in 888 patients
with diabetes mellitus who received  xxxd53xxx 
compared with 574 who received placebo (2.5% vs
4.5%; p = 0.031); mortality was also lower in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus treated with
 xxxd53xxx  than in those receiving placebo (n = 265
and 197, respectively), although this did not achieve
statistical significance (4.2% vs 8.1%).[84] a reduction in the combined endpoint of death, mi or targetvessel revascularisation (29.1% vs 34.3%; p =
0.022) and mi alone (4.0% vs 9.7%; p < 0.001) was
seen in patients who received  xxxd53xxx  compared
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

 xxxd53xxx 

with patients who received placebo. predictors of
1-year mortality in a multivariate model were a
history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
chronic heart failure, age ≥65 years or a type b2/c
lesion.[84]
a pooled analysis comparing the effect of the
various percutaneous coronary interventions used in
the epic, capture, epilog, rapport and
epistent trials (n = 8007) demonstrated significant reductions in the incidence of mortality or mi
at 30 days and 6 months compared with placebo
when either angioplasty, elective or bailout stent or
directional coronary atherectomy were used in combination with  xxxd53xxx  therapy (hazard ratios
range 0.37–0.64).[85] combined results from the epilog and epistent trials also showed a significant reduction in death or mi at 1 year in patients
receiving  xxxd53xxx  in combination with either
angioplasty (hazard ratio 0.51; p < 0.001) or stent
(hazard ratio 0.60; p = 0.02) but not placebo plus
stent (hazard ratio 1.14; p = 0.46) compared to those
receiving placebo plus angioplasty.[86]
3.3.1 comparison with other platelet glycoprotein
iib/iiia antagonists

the two meta-analyses reported in this section
compared results from prospective, randomised,
placebo-controlled studies involving the therapeutic
use of  xxxd53xxx , eptifabatide or  xxxd3385xxx  in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.[87,88]
the first compared 30-day outcomes in 8876
patients who received either  xxxd53xxx ,  xxxd3385xxx  or
 xxxd2017xxx  in the epic, epilog, epistent,
capture, rapport, integrilin to minimize
platelet aggregation and prevent coronary thrombosis-1 (impact-1), impact-ii and randomized
efficacy study of  xxxd3385xxx  for outcomes and restenosis (restore) studies.[87] briefly, the platelet
gp iib/iiia antagonist was given shortly before the
interventional procedure (except in capture,
where treatment was administered 18–24 hours

1145

before percutaneous coronary intervention), and
treatment duration following revascularisation
ranged from 1–36 hours. all patients also received
aspirin and heparin. overall, no significant reduction in mortality was observed in groups who received  xxxd53xxx  (odds ratio 0.69),  xxxd2017xxx  or
 xxxd3385xxx  (odds ratio for both drugs 0.74) compared
with placebo. however, the incidence of acute mi
was more than halved with  xxxd53xxx  (odds ratio
0.49; p = 0.001), but not with  xxxd2017xxx  or  xxxd3385xxx  (odds ratio 0.85); all drugs significantly reduced
the need for urgent revascularisation (odds ratios
0.42 for  xxxd53xxx  and 0.76 for  xxxd2017xxx  and
 xxxd3385xxx ; p = 0.001 and 0.023).[87]
the second analysis pooled results from the randomised and placebo-controlled capture, platelet glycoprotein iib/iiia in unstable angina: receptor suppression using integrilin ( xxxd2017xxx ) therapy (pursuit) and platelet receptor inhibition in
ischemic syndrome management in patients limited by unstable signs (prism-plus) trials, which
administered either  xxxd53xxx ,  xxxd2017xxx  or  xxxd3385xxx  to patients with acs (without persistent stsegment elevation) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.[88] a 34% reduction in the risk of
death or nonfatal mi was seen in patients who
received a platelet gp iib/iiia antagonist (n = 6125)
compared with placebo (n = 6171; p < 0.001). in
addition, the event rate during the 48 hours after
percutaneous coronary intervention was reduced to
a greater extent in patients who received a platelet
gp iib/iiia antagonist than in those receiving placebo (4.9% vs 8.0%; p < 0.001), but did not differ
significantly after this time.[88] it is important to note
that direct comparative trials give more valid results
than meta-analyses, which may not be particularly
reliable if patient groups and drug dosages differ.
3.4 in unstable angina pectoris

results from the capture study were reported
in the previous review in drugs.[8] briefly, patients
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

1146

with refractory uap received either placebo or
 xxxd53xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus then continuous infusion 10 mug/min) 18–24 hours before undergoing
percutaneous coronary revascularisation. all patients also received iv nitroglycerin ( xxxd2741xxx ), beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and other
cardiovascular drugs as necessary. a relative reduction of 29% was seen in the primary 30-day endpoint
(death, mi or urgent intervention to treat ischaemia)
in patients who received  xxxd53xxx , largely as a
result of a reduced incidence of mi. however, the
beneficial effect of  xxxd53xxx  was no longer evident
at the 6-month follow-up, where the incidence of
ischaemic complications was ≈30% in both
groups.[49]
more recent data published from the capture
study focused on angiographic treatment and outcomes,[89] recurrent ischaemia[90] and the relationship between serum troponin t levels and potential
clinical benefit with  xxxd53xxx .[91,92]
thrombus resolution was greater both before and
during angioplasty in 1197 patients with two available angiograms who were treated with  xxxd53xxx 
than in those receiving placebo (p = 0.033).[89] repetitive ischaemia and total ischaemic burden were
both significantly reduced in a subset of patients
who underwent continuous electrocardiographic
monitoring and who received  xxxd53xxx , although
the incidence of recurrent ischaemia did not differ
between patients treated with  xxxd53xxx  and placebo.[90]
approximately one-third of patients (excluding
those presenting with mi 14 days prior to study
entry) for whom serum samples were available (n =
890) showed elevated troponin t levels (>0.1 mug/l)
at study entry which correlated with an increased
risk of death or nonfatal mi at 6 months.[91] the
relative risk of death or nonfatal mi associated with
 xxxd53xxx  treatment, compared with placebo, in
these patients was reduced approximately 70% (p =
0.002). this was mainly attributable to a reduction
© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

ibbotson et al.

in the rate of mi (odds ratio 0.23; p < 0.001). no
relationship was observed in patients without elevated serum troponin t levels.
3.5 in patients without
early revascularisation

one large randomised, multicentre study (gusto iv-acs) has investigated whether  xxxd53xxx 
would reduce the composite endpoint of death or mi
in patients with high risk acs who were not scheduled to undergo early revascularisation (within 12
hours of end of infusion).[93] patients received either
placebo (n = 2598),  xxxd53xxx  bolus and 24-hour
infusion (n = 2590) or  xxxd53xxx  bolus and 48-hour
infusion (n = 2612) in addition to aspirin and either
unfractionated or  xxxd1997xxx 
( xxxd1805xxx ). baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups; 28% of all patients had
evolving mi, 59% were positive for serum troponin
t or i and 80% showed st-segment depression.
coronary revascularisation was performed in 30%
of patients within 30 days of study entry.
at 48 hours, higher mortality was evident in
patients who received either regimen of  xxxd53xxx 
than in placebo recipients (odds ratios 2.3 and 2.9
for 24- and 48-hour  xxxd53xxx  infusions, respectively; p = 0.048 and 0.007 vs placebo); the incidence of
mi and the combined endpoint of death or mi did
not differ significantly between the groups. similarly, no differences were apparent between the groups
in any of the endpoints at either 7 or 30 days
(primary endpoint) after treatment. analysis of various subgroups, including sex, age, weight, presence
of diabetes mellitus, geographical region, st-segment depression and positive troponin t revealed no
significant benefit of treatment with  xxxd53xxx ;
however, a significantly greater proportion of
women treated with the 48-hour  xxxd53xxx  infusion
showed adverse outcomes (either death or mi) than
those receiving placebo at 30 days (10.1% vs 7.2%,
p value not reported).[93]

4. tolerability
this section provides a brief overview of the
incidence and severity of bleeding complications
and thrombocytopenia previously reported and includes new data from patients enrolled in the large
admiral,[63] gusto iv-acs[93] and target[51] clinical trials. in addition, new data in patients with acute mi concurrently receiving various
fibrinolytic therapies are presented.
4.1 overview of haematological effects

the most commonly occurring adverse events
associated with the use of  xxxd53xxx  are bleeding
complications and thrombocytopenia, although the
risk of major bleeding can be limited through careful
selection of patients, use of a low-dose bodyweightadjusted regimen of heparin, discontinuation of heparin immediately following revascularisation, early
removal of the vascular sheath and femoral artery
access site care (also see section 6).
4.1.1 incidence of bleeding

in recent large, randomised clinical trials (admiral,[63] gusto iv-acs[93] and target[51]),
major bleeding with a standard dose of  xxxd53xxx 
(0.6–0.7% of patients) was similar to that seen with
placebo (0% and 0.3%)[63,93] and  xxxd3385xxx  (0.9%),[51]
although extension of the  xxxd53xxx  infusion to 48
hours significantly increased the incidence of major
bleeding complications relative to placebo in one
arm of the gusto iv-acs trial (1% vs 0.3%; p <
0.05).[93] however, rates of minor bleeding with
 xxxd53xxx  were significantly increased (3–12.1%)
compared with either placebo (2% and 3.3%)[63,93] or
 xxxd3385xxx  (2.8% vs 4.3%) [all p < 0.05].[51]
data from the cadillac study suggests that
addition of  xxxd53xxx  to either stenting or to coronary angioplasty has no significant effect on the incidence of moderate or severe haemorrhagic complications. intracranial haemorrhage was also similar
between treatment groups.[64] furthermore, in pre© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

liminary results of the multicentre, nonrandomised,
nonblind nice 3 study, patients with acs were
treated with enoxaparin and either  xxxd53xxx  (n =
147),  xxxd3385xxx  (n = 217) or  xxxd2017xxx  (n = 252).
following treatment with  xxxd53xxx , non-cabg
major bleeding was observed in 0.7% of patients
compared with 1.4% and 3.2% of patients who
received  xxxd3385xxx  or  xxxd2017xxx . in patients who
also underwent percutaneous coronary intervention,
0%, 0.9% and 2.4% had major non-cabg bleeding,
respectively.[94]
pooled analysis from the placebo-controlled
epic, capture, epilog, rapport and epistent trials also suggests that the incidence of
minor, but not major, bleeding is significantly increased relative to placebo following either angioplasty or elective stenting; rates of minor bleeding
with bailout stenting and directional atherectomy
were similar.[85] rates of major bleeding increased
in patients who received  xxxd53xxx  compared with
placebo in a meta-analysis of eight placebo-controlled trials involving the use of platelet gp iib/iiia
antagonists in percutaneous coronary intervention
(5.8% vs 3.8%; p = 0.001). in contrast, the incidence
of major bleeding among patients treated with  xxxd2017xxx  or  xxxd3385xxx  did not differ significantly
from that with placebo (5.0% vs 4.3%).[87] additionally, subgroup analysis from the epic, epilog and
epistent trials showed an increase in minor
bleeding in female patients who received  xxxd53xxx 
compared with placebo (4.7% vs 6.7%, p = 0.017).
minor bleeding complications were significantly
higher in female than in male patients receiving
 xxxd53xxx  (6.7% vs 2.2%; p < 0.001) and placebo
(4.7% vs 2.3%, p = 0.01).[82]
a pooled analysis of the epic, epilog, epistent, rapport and capture trials in 5721
patients who received  xxxd53xxx  and heparin while
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention
showed no excess of intracranial haemorrhage compared with that in placebo and heparin recipients (n

= 3321) [0.14% vs 0.09%].[95] in addition, two preliminary reports reported no significant increase in
bleeding or in-hospital complications in patients
undergoing revascularisation who were treated with
 xxxd53xxx  and were either octogenarians[96] or had
chronic renal insufficiency.[97]
the incidence of major and minor bleeding was
significantly (p < 0.001) higher in prospectively
enrolled consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 12 hours of
acute mi and received  xxxd53xxx  (2.4% and 14.3%;
n = 831) than those who did not (0.6% and 5.9%; n =
1728).[98] patients treated with  xxxd53xxx  were more
likely to have been treated within 12 hours of infarction and to have received heparin after the procedure; however, use of  xxxd53xxx  was independently
associated with an increase in major and minor
bleeding in multivariate analysis.
4.1.2 thrombocytopenia

thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 × 109/l)
developed in 2.4–7% of  xxxd53xxx -treated patients
(the higher value was recorded in patients receiving
a 48 hour infusion of  xxxd53xxx  in gusto ivacs) compared with ≈1% of placebo and 0.5% of
 xxxd3385xxx  recipients in the admiral,[63] gusto
iv-acs[93] and target[51] clinical trials. severe
thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 × 109/l) was
observed in 0.9–2% of patients who received  xxxd53xxx , 0.04% and 1.3% of placebo recipients and
0.1% of  xxxd3385xxx  recipients.  xxxd53xxx -induced
thrombocytopenia develops rapidly and usually resolves after discontinuation of therapy.[8]
mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 90–100 ×
109/l) was more common in patients undergoing
coronary intervention enrolled in the epic, epilog and capture studies who were treated with
 xxxd53xxx  compared with placebo recipients (4.2%
vs 2.0%; p < 0.001), as was severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 × 109/l; 1.0% vs 0.4%; p =
0.01). in the cadillac study, the incidence of
thrombocytopenia was also significantly lower in

patients receiving angioplasty only compared to
those patients receiving  xxxd53xxx  with either angioplasty or stenting.[64] the incidence of mild or
severe thrombocytopenia was not significantly increased in patients who received either  xxxd2017xxx 
or  xxxd3385xxx  in prospective, randomised, placebocontrolled trials.[99] more recently, factors associated with the development of thrombocytopenia in
a pooled analysis from the epic, epilog and
epistent trials (n = 178; 2.4% of all patients)
were age >65 years, weight <90kg, baseline platelet
count <200 x 109/l, treatment with  xxxd53xxx  and
enrolment in the epic trial (all p < 0.05).[100] however, patients with thrombocytopenia who also received  xxxd53xxx  prior to coronary intervention had
lower rates of bleeding and transfusion than other
patients with thrombocytopenia.
pseudothrombocytopenia (defined as either differing platelet counts with two anticoagulants, platelet clumping on a blood smear from anticoagulated
blood, normal platelet count on a blood smear from
nonanticoagulated blood or an unexplained reduction in platelet count at 30 minutes to 4 hours after
 xxxd53xxx  bolus with recovery to normal) has been
reported in an earlier clinical study,[101] although the
implications of this for the treatment of patients with
 xxxd53xxx  is unknown. 2.1% of patients treated with
 xxxd53xxx  were identified as having pseudothrombocytopenia in pooled data from the capture,
epic, epilog and epistent trials compared
with 0.6% of patients who received placebo (p <
0.001).[102] approximately one-third of all patients
with thrombocytopenia had pseudothrombocytopenia. twelve percent of  xxxd53xxx -treated patients
required early cessation of treatment and none in the
placebo group; this is in contrast to 34.6% and
44.6% of all patients with thrombocytopenia, respectively. however, the incidence of bleeding,
stroke, transfusion or repeat revascularisation was
not increased in patients with pseudothrombocytopenia.[102]

4.2 in combination with fibrinolytic therapy

major bleeding occurs in approximately 20–25%
of patients who receive  xxxd53xxx  within 24 hours
of full-dose fibrinolytic therapy, although the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage is similar to that
seen in all patients treated with a fibrinolytic drug
alone.[103] therefore, the potential for bleeding complications is a particular concern in patients treated
with a combination of  xxxd53xxx  and a fibrinolytic
drug. this section focuses on studies which have
investigated the use of  xxxd53xxx  in combination
with either  xxxd3308xxx , reteplase or  xxxg1766xxx  compared with the fibrinolytic drug alone (refer to section 3.2.2 for study details).
overall, rates of minor and major bleeding associated with combination  xxxd53xxx  and either reduced-dose reteplase or  xxxd3308xxx  treatment in
the assent-3 and gusto-v trials were consistently and significantly higher than those for either
reteplase or  xxxd3308xxx  alone, as were rates for
thrombocytopenia (table vii). bleeding (of any severity) was more frequent in patients who received
reteplase and  xxxd53xxx  in the gusto-v study
than in the group given reteplase alone (24.6% vs
13.7%; p < 0.0001) but bleeding was not increased
in patients subsequently undergoing cabg or a

cardiac catheterisation procedure.[73] in the assent-3 study, combination therapy with  xxxd3308xxx  plus  xxxd53xxx  with enoxaparin produced significantly lower rates of the primary efficacy plus
safety endpoint than  xxxd3308xxx  plus unfractionated heparin (14.2% and 13.8% vs 17%; p < 0.05).[72]
however, the incidence of major bleeding complications was significantly higher with  xxxd3308xxx  plus
 xxxd53xxx  than with  xxxd3308xxx  plus unfractionated heparin in patients aged >75 years (4.1% vs
13.3%) or among those with diabetes mellitus (2.2%
vs 7.0%).[72]
major bleeding rates in the speed trial were
3.3% for  xxxd53xxx  alone, 5.3% and 9.8% for combination  xxxd53xxx  and reteplase and 3.7% for
reteplase alone but differences were not significant.
the use of either standard- or low-dose heparin did
not affect the incidence of major bleeding (6.3% vs
10.5%).[74]
transfusion rates were higher with  xxxd53xxx 
plus fibrinolytic therapy than with the fibrinolytic
alone in gusto-v (5.7% vs 4%; p = 0.0001)[73] and
assent-3 (4.2% vs 2.3%; p = 0.001),[72] but were
similar between groups in the smaller speed
trial.[74] rates of intracranial haemorrhage were similar for all groups in all trials (generally <1%).[72-75]

4.3 readministration

at the time of the previous review, evidence
suggested that  xxxd53xxx  could be safely readministered to patients, although a greater incidence, severity and duration of thrombocytopenia had been reported.[8] in addition, the human-murine composition of the monoclonal chimaeric fab fragment
comprising  xxxd53xxx  is potentially antigenic and
has led to concern over the potential for anaphylaxis
and attenuated efficacy.[104]
human antichimaeric antibodies (haca) were
documented in 6.5% of patients in the epic trial.[47]
however, no cases of anaphylactic, allergic or other
hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in 500
patients enrolled in the reopro readministration
registry, of whom 4.8% were haca-positive
before readministration of  xxxd53xxx . major bleeding was reported in 1.6% of patients, all of whom
required red blood cell transfusions. thrombocytopenia was seen in 4.6% of these patients (severe in
3.2%) and was unrelated to baseline haca status.
clinical success (defined as angiographically successful procedure without any major adverse cardiac
events) was similar between patients who received
 xxxd53xxx  for the first and second time (94.7% vs
90.9%).[105]
a retrospective analysis of 164 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention indicated that 4% experienced severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 × 109/l) following
readministration of  xxxd53xxx . moreover, the rate of
severe thrombocytopenia increased when  xxxd53xxx 
was readministered within 2 weeks of the first dose
(12% vs 2%; p = 0.046) as was the requirement for a
blood transfusion (20% vs 6%; p < 0.05).[106]
5. pharmacoeconomic considerations
the pharmacoeconomics of  xxxd53xxx  for use in
percutaneous coronary revascularisation were recently reviewed in pharmacoeconomics.[9] this
© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

ibbotson et al.

section provides an overview of previous analyses
from major trials and focuses on newly available
information pertaining to the pharmacoeconomics
of  xxxd53xxx  from the epistent and epilog
clinical trials and in comparison with other platelet
gp iib/iiia antagonists.
economic analyses attached to the epilog and
epistent trials were prospectively designed;
however, the majority of other analyses were retrospective. there have also been several retrospective
pharmacoeconomic analyses from the practice setting and these are reported in section 5.2. a notable
exception to this was the prospectively designed
price trial (see section 5.3).
5.1 cost analyses based on major
clinical trials

a previously reported prospective economic substudy (in which hospital costs, inpatient physician
fees and drug acquisition costs were considered)
carried out in conjunction with the epic study in
high-risk patients showed use of  xxxd53xxx  resulted
in an incremental cost compared with standard care
of $us293 per patient over 6 months (1991/1992
values).  xxxd53xxx  was cost saving in patients with
uap in a subgroup analysis. this section focuses on
more recent pharmacoeconomic data associated
with the epistent and epilog studies.
5.1.1 analyses based on epistent

a cost analysis is available from a prospectively
defined subset of patients in the us who participated
in the epistent study (n = 1438).[57] total baseline hospital costs were higher in the stent plus
 xxxd53xxx  than in the stent plus placebo or angioplasty plus  xxxd53xxx  groups ($us13 228 vs
11 923 vs 11 357; 1997 values; p < 0.0001). at 1
year, follow-up costs (including hospital and physician costs) were similar between groups ($us5096,
$us4723 and $us6013 for the three groups, respectively); cumulative costs at 1 year were higher in
both the stent plus  xxxd53xxx  (by $us932) and
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

in addition, one cost analysis extrapolated the
results of the epistent trial to a european setting
based on an economic evaluation from the belgian
netherlands stent (benestent)-ii study.[107] the
analysis was from a societal perspective and included only direct medical costs. the estimated mean
costs per patient after 6 months’ treatment with
either stent plus placebo, stent plus  xxxd53xxx  or
angioplasty plus  xxxd53xxx  were eur8207,
eur8971 (p < 0.01 vs both groups) and eur8085,
respectively (1998 values).
5.1.2 analyses based on epilog

a prospectively designed economic substudy of
epilog gathered information on medical costs and
medical resource use in both high- and low-risk
patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularisation (table viii).[108] cost savings in baseline
hospital costs associated with efficacy and bleeding
events with  xxxd53xxx  were for the most part attributed to a reduced requirement for repeat revascularisation and bailout stenting and shorter hospital
stays. at baseline, hospitalisation costs associated
with  xxxd53xxx  were significantly higher than for
© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

the placebo group. over a 6-month follow-up
period, hospitalisation costs remained higher in the
 xxxd53xxx  groups because of an increase in the
number of patients undergoing nonurgent revascularisation. this resulted in significantly greater cumulative 6-month costs in the  xxxd53xxx  groups
than with placebo.[108]
5.1.3 analyses based on other studies

an abstract has reported on the cost of  xxxd53xxx 
and stenting from the cadillac trial (see section
3.2.1 for study details).[109] these preliminary results suggest that the mean (or median) hospital
costs associated with either angioplasty or stenting
in combination with  xxxd53xxx  are not significantly
different from those seen with angioplasty alone.
moreover, the average hospital stay was also similar
between groups (range 3.8–4.4 days).
5.2 cost analyses in the practice setting

three nonrandomised studies have compared
clinical outcomes and costs of consecutive patients
who received  xxxd53xxx  and underwent percutaneous coronary interventions in a single medical practice (year of currency not specified).[110-112]
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

1152

in a us-based study, 3758 patients underwent
elective revascularisation over a 2.5-year period;
908 received  xxxd53xxx  and 633 received  xxxd53xxx 
plus a stent. overall, the incidence of major cardiac
events was significantly lower in patients who received  xxxd53xxx  with stenting or angioplasty than
angioplasty alone (all p < 0.002) because of a decreased need for revascularisation. total in-hospital
costs were lower in patients who received angioplasty alone than for the other patients (p < 0.001).
independent predictors of increased costs in multivariate regression analysis were death ($us16 098),
urgent revascularisation ($us13 678), use of multiple stents ($us1423/device) and use of  xxxd53xxx 
($us1269).[111]
a dutch observational study also showed a decreased incidence of major cardiac events in patients
who received  xxxd53xxx  in addition to stenting compared with those who did not receive a stent (6.9%
vs 16.9%; p = 0.04); however, total costs at 6
months were similar between the two groups
(eur7844 vs eur7904).[112] in-hospital mortality
was not significantly different between patients who
did and did not receive  xxxd53xxx  in addition to
coronary intervention (n = 986 and 486, respectively), but was lower at 6 months in patients who were
treated with  xxxd53xxx  (4.98% vs 1.55%; p =
0.003).[110]
5.3 cost analyses in comparison with other
platelet glycoprotein iib/iiia antagonists

among lower risk patients undergoing elective
percutaneous coronary revascularisation, the use of
 xxxd53xxx  therapy has been associated with higher
total in-hospital and 6-month medical costs compared with  xxxd2017xxx  therapy.[113] in a prospective
study (price) in the us, consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary revascularisation (excluding those with acute mi within 48 hours, or
uap with st-segment elevation) were randomised
to receive either  xxxd53xxx  (n = 163) or  xxxd2017xxx 
© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

ibbotson et al.

(n = 157). subsequently, total median in-hospital
costs were higher in those who received  xxxd53xxx 
than  xxxd2017xxx  ($us8268 vs $us7207; p = 0.009;
1998 values), primarily because of the higher acquisition cost of  xxxd53xxx  (p < 0.0001 vs  xxxd2017xxx );
this was evident up to 30 days after treatment
($us8336 vs $us7207).[113] as this study excluded
patients with acute mi, the data are not generalisable
to other patient populations and the small staudy
sample size means that it was insufficiently powered
to detect clinical differences betwen treatments.[113]
the economic implications of the use of glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors have been examined in
patients with acute coronary syndromes and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention using data
from up to 14 clinical studies.[114] for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, procurement costs ranged from $us400–$us1500
(1999 costs); for  xxxd53xxx , mean procurement
costs were estimated at $us1407 per patient treated.
these costs were, at least partially offset by subsequent savings in other direct medical costs, and
when the clinical outcomes of using  xxxd53xxx  in
this setting (including coronary stenting) were accounted for, procurement costs of $us10
500–$us37 000 per death or mi prevented were
estimated. cost effectiveness ratios for  xxxd53xxx 
were $us2875–$us14 765 per life-year or qaly
saved.[114]
5.3.1 effect of  xxxd53xxx  on length of
hospital stay

two retrospective analyses have compared the
effect of treatment with  xxxd53xxx  and either  xxxd2017xxx  or  xxxd3385xxx  on length of hospital stay in
patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.[115,116] data were captured from the hcia
clinical pathways database which included information from 72 hospitals in the us performing
percutaneous coronary revascularisations between 1
july 1998 and 30 june 1999. patients treated with
 xxxd53xxx  spent fewer days in hospital than patients
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

who received  xxxd3385xxx  (3.34 vs 4.32 days; p <
0.001) even when the analysis was restricted to
patients with acute mi (4.28 vs 5.09 days; p <
0.001).[116] similarly, hospital stays for patients
treated with  xxxd53xxx  were 0.83 days shorter than
for those who received  xxxd2017xxx  (p < 0.001).[115]
in both analyses patients treated with  xxxd3385xxx  or
 xxxd2017xxx  were significantly older and a higher
proportion received a stent or angioplasty compared
with those in the  xxxd53xxx  groups.[115,116]

5.4 cost-effectiveness analyses
5.4.1 based on major clinical trials

costs included in a prospectively defined subset
of patients who took part in the epistent study in
the us (n = 1438) were hospital costs, physician
fees and drug acquisition costs ($us450/vial of
 xxxd53xxx ). lifetime cost effectiveness was evaluated based on us cost data and overall 1-year survival data.[57] analyses were performed from a societal perspective but did not include productivity, nonmedical or outpatient costs; incremental costs
beyond 1 year were discounted at 3%.
after taking incremental life expectancy into
consideration, the stent plus  xxxd53xxx  group showed an incremental cost of $us932, or cost-effectiveness ratio of $us6213 per added life-year compared
with the stent and placebo group. compared with
patients in the  xxxd53xxx  and angioplasty group,
patients who received  xxxd53xxx  plus stent had an
incremental cost of $us581 and a cost-effectiveness
ratio of $us5291 per added life-year.[57]
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the
addition of  xxxd53xxx  to treatment in mi-free and
major cardiac event-free patients when the results of
the epistent study were extrapolated to a european setting are presented in figure 5. costs included
the initial stenting procedure, cost of  xxxd53xxx  and
the need for bailout stenting or repeated procedures.
follow-up costs included further use of  xxxd53xxx ,

costs included diagnostic procedures (hospital visits, tests and angiography), where subsequent visits

these values compare broadly with accepted
benchmarks for cost-effectiveness in other medical
arenas.[117] accepted cost-effectiveness benchmarks
for coronary bypass surgery compared with medical
therapy, medical therapy compared with no medical
therapy for severe hypertension and haemodialysis
compared with no dialysis for chronic renal failure
are us$32 678, us$7000 and us$35 000 per year
of life saved (1993 costs).[117]
5.4.2 based on other studies

one italian-based analysis has evaluated the cost
effectiveness of  xxxd53xxx  based on 6-month results
from the epilog, epic (not including patients who
received only  xxxd53xxx  bolus) and capture
studies.[118] the cost of  xxxd53xxx  was calculated
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

1154

assuming that patients were between 51 and 91kg
and required three 10mg vials of the drug; eventassociated costs were based on diagnosis-related
groups. costs are expressed in millions of lire (year
of currency not specified). total treatment costs
associated with  xxxd53xxx  and placebo for 100 patients scheduled to undergo angioplasty were l1244
and l1079, respectively; increased costs in the
 xxxd53xxx  group were primarily because of drug
acquisition costs. the corresponding numbers of
patients needed to treat to prevent one death,
reinfarction, cabg, angioplasty or composite endpoint were 227, 24, 75, 37 and 21, respectively.
moreover, the cost-effectiveness ratios for patients
in the  xxxd53xxx  and placebo groups were l16.6 and
 xxxg1978xxx .4 per event-free patient (approximately
$us7543 and $us6998; 2002 values), resulting in
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of l34.3
($us15 587) per event avoided at 6 months after
intervention. the cost per year of life saved at this
time point was l32.3 ($us14 678).[118]
5.4.3 in the practice setting

incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (adjusted
for nonrandomisation and expressed as euros per
life-year gained) in a dutch observational study,
were eur1243 for all patients and eur1933 for
those also receiving a stent; for patients with and
without diabetes mellitus these were eur617 and
eur1066, respectively.[112] costs were based on
values derived from the netherlands in an economic
substudy attached to benestent-ii.
in patients with acute mi undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, those receiving  xxxd53xxx  had significantly lower risk-adjusted mortality
than those not treated with glycoprotein iib/iiia
inhibitors (odds ratio = 0.74, p = 0.007).[119] there
was no significant difference between patients receiving  xxxd2017xxx  or  xxxd3385xxx  and those not treated
with this class of agent. treatment with  xxxd53xxx 
also resulted in a significantly shorter hospital stay

the recommended dosage of  xxxd53xxx  is a 0.25
mg/kg iv bolus administered 10–60 minutes before
the start of percutaneous coronary intervention, followed by a continuous iv infusion of 0.125 mug/kg/
min (up to a maximum of 10 mug/min) for 12 hours.
patients with uap may be treated with  xxxd53xxx 
0.25 mg/kg iv bolus followed by an 18- to 24-hour
iv infusion of 10 mug/min which finishes 1 hour (us
recommendation) or 12 hours (uk recommendation) after percutaneous coronary intervention.
 xxxd53xxx  and heparin should be discontinued in
the event of serious bleeding which is unable to be
managed by compression alone.[28]
because the risk of bleeding may be increased
with  xxxd53xxx  therapy, the drug is recommended to
be given in addition to a low-dose, weight-adjusted
heparin regimen.[28]  xxxd53xxx  is contraindicated
where patients are at an increased risk for bleeding
complications, such as those with active internal
bleeding, recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary
bleeding, history of stroke, bleeding diathesis, previous treatment with oral anticoagulants (within 7
days), thrombocytopenia, major surgery or trauma
within the last 6 weeks, severe and uncontrolled
hypertension, history of vasculitis or use of iv dextran prior to percutaneous coronary intervention.
caution is also required in patients receiving other
drugs that affect haemostasis, including fibridrugs 2003; 63 (11)

 xxxd53xxx 

nolytics, oral anticoagulants, nsaids,  xxxd1914xxx  and ticlopidine or clopidogrel.
the risk of bleeding may be minimised through
adherence to anticoagulation guidelines, careful vascular access site management, discontinuation of
heparin following the procedure (within 6 hours if
aptt ≤50 seconds or act ≤175 seconds) and early
femoral artery sheath removal.[28]
platelet counts should be monitored before and
during treatment (at approximately 2–4 following
the bolus dose and at 24 hours prior to discharge). if
thrombocytopenia (<100 × 109/l and a ≥25% decrease from the pretreatment value) is confirmed,
 xxxd53xxx  (and possibly heparin) should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. platelet
transfusions can be used to restore platelet function
to reverse profound thrombocytopenia (<20 × 109/
l), if patients require emergency surgery, or in the
event of serious uncontrolled bleeding.[28]
administration of  xxxd53xxx  may result in
human anti-chimeric antibody formation (as indicated by approximately 5.8% of  xxxd53xxx -treated patients in clinical trials).[28] results from a small
group of patients indicate that the incidence of the
antibody formation may be increased upon  xxxd53xxx  readministration (further details available in
section 4.3).[28]
7. place of  xxxd53xxx  in the
management of ischaemic
heart disease
conventional therapy for patients with acs has
involved early initiation of medical management
followed by noninvasive risk stratification to identify patients who require urgent catheterisation, and
possibly revascularisation, rather than pharmacotherapy alone. antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and
antithrombotic therapy with heparin have been the
cornerstone of treatment for patients with acs.
however, consistently observed benefits with gp
iib/iiia antagonists as an adjunct to aspirin and

heparin in large randomised clinical trials have also
led to their therapeutic use in patients undergoing
percutaneous coronary intervention. furthermore,
interventional management may consist of either
early invasive or conservative strategies. no clear
difference has been observed between the two,[120]
although an invasive strategy is likely to be more
beneficial in high-risk patients.[121]
 xxxd53xxx ,  xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd3385xxx  are the
three iv gp iib/iiia platelet antagonists currently
approved by the us food and drug administration
for therapeutic use in acs and/or as adjunctive
therapy to percutaneous coronary intervention. in
addition, american college of cardiology/american heart association guidelines for management of
percutaneous coronary intervention,[122] and european society of cardiology recommendations[123] for
acs both indicate the use of iv gp iib/iiia receptor
antagonists in patients undergoing angioplasty, especially high-risk patients. each of the gp iib/iiia
antagonists has been approved for use in slightly
different indications based on the results of major
clinical trials.  xxxd53xxx  is approved for use as an
adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention for
the prevention of cardiac ischaemic complications
in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or in patients with uap not responding to
conventional medical therapy when percutaneous
coronary intervention is planned within 24 hours. in
comparison,  xxxd3385xxx  is indicated for patients with
unstable angina or non-q-wave mi who are to be
managed medically and those undergoing ptca or
atherectomy, and  xxxd2017xxx  for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, including
those undergoing intracoronary stenting, and patients with unstable angina/non-q-wave mi, including those who are to be managed medically and
those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.[124] several orally administered gp iib/iiia
platelet antagonists have also been developed; however, these have shown poor results in four large
drugs 2003; 63 (11)

1156

clinical trials and none have been approved for
clinical use.[125-127]
 xxxd53xxx  has a stronger affinity for the gp iib/
iiia receptor than do either  xxxd3385xxx  or  xxxd2017xxx ;
it also binds to  xxxg2422xxx  and  xxxg1206xxx   xxxg1209xxx  receptors
where the other platelet gp iib/iiia antagonists do
not. while these other receptors modulate smooth
muscle cell adhesion and proliferation[46] and are
thought to be important for platelet-leucocyte interactions, the clinical significance of this is not yet
apparent. other important differences exist between
these drugs.  xxxd3385xxx  and  xxxd2017xxx  have relatively short durations of action while the duration of
action of  xxxd53xxx  may be longer (see section
2.1.1). in addition, the three drugs are structurally
distinct:  xxxd2017xxx  is a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide[33] and  xxxd3385xxx  a synthetic nonpeptide,[128]
whereas  xxxd53xxx  is a monoclonal antibody.[8]
the target study investigated the relative efficacies of  xxxd53xxx  and  xxxd3385xxx  as adjunctive
therapy to percutaneous coronary intervention.
 xxxd53xxx  demonstrated a significantly greater reduction than  xxxd3385xxx  in the composite endpoint of
death, nonfatal mi or urgent target-vessel revascularisation at 30 days. this difference in primary
endpoint at 30 days was largely due to a significant
reduction in the incidence of mi in patients treated
with  xxxd53xxx  compared to those treated with  xxxd3385xxx  and this was maintained at 6 months (section
3.1.1). interestingly,  xxxd53xxx  plus enoxaparin
provided effective anticoagulation during percutaneous coronary intervention in this study. the lowmolecular-weight heparins have been recommended
for use as antithrombotic therapy in acs;[121]
whether the combination of low-molecular-weight
heparins with  xxxd53xxx  is better than unfractionated heparin remains to be demonstrated in clinical
trials.
the beneficial effect of  xxxd53xxx  in high-risk
patients reported in the epic study is also confirmed
in patients with differing risk levels, as shown by the

ibbotson et al.

findings of the epistent and epilog studies (at
30 days and 1 year). a significantly reduced incidence of mi, target-vessel revascularisation and
composite of death, mi and target-vessel revascularisation was observed in patients treated with
 xxxd53xxx  compared with placebo, although not on
death alone. this effect was consistent across a
range of subgroups including age, sex, bodyweight
or indication for revascularisation (section 3.1.2).
patients with diabetes mellitus are at higher risk
for ischaemic heart disease than patients without
diabetes mellitus, potentially because of alterations
in platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. in
addition, outcomes both during and following revascularisation or cabg are worse in patients with
diabetes mellitus than in those without.[129] the
composite endpoint of death, mi or target-vessel
revascularisation was reduced relative to placebo in
a prospectively defined subset of patients with diabetes mellitus in epistent who received  xxxd53xxx  in addition to stenting. there was also a 65%
reduction in the 6-month mortality rate which was
maintained at 1 year in patients receiving stent plus
 xxxd53xxx  relative to those who received stent plus
placebo; these differences in mortality rates between
treatments were not statistically significant (section
3.1.2).
the diagnostic value of the serum troponins for
identifying patients who may benefit from treatment
with gp iib/iiia receptor antagonists has been
shown in several studies. in troponin-positive patients with uap, the relative risk of death or nonfatal mi associated with  xxxd53xxx  treatment, compared with placebo, in these patients was reduced
approximately 70% and was mainly attributable to a
reduction in the rate of mi. however, no relationship was observed in patients without elevated serum troponin t levels (section 3.4). in addition,
several analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of
gp iib/iiia antagonists in those undergoing early
angiography and revascularisation.[48,49,130] paradoxdrugs 2003; 63 (11)

 xxxd53xxx 

1157

ically, this was not replicated in a large prospective
trial, gusto iv-acs, of patients with uap or nonq-wave mi (58–60% of whom were serum troponin
positive) treated with  xxxd53xxx  who were not
scheduled to undergo early revascularisation and
were given the drug as primary medical therapy
(section 3.5). this was an unexpected result given
the benefits demonstrated with other gp iib/iiia
antagonists as primary medical therapy.[131-133] a
number of factors may have contributed to the findings of this study. the event rate in the placebo
group was ≈3% lower than expected and nearly 40%
of patients were female. in addition, the low incidence of st-segment depression may have also allowed patients without active coronary artery disease to be enrolled.[93] whether this is an isolated
finding, given the body of current evidence which
suggests otherwise, requires further investigation.

ry composite endpoint approximately 60% compared with placebo at 30 days), combination of the
two provided no additional benefit over either  xxxd53xxx  or stenting alone in the nonblind cadillac
trial (see section 3.2.1). this may have been because
of the early use of  xxxd53xxx  prior to revascularisation in more than 25% of patients in the admiral
trial. in addition, baseline timi 3 flow rates were
significantly higher in the combination group in this
study than those randomised to receive stenting
alone at baseline, whereas these groups were evenly
balanced in the cadillac study. however, the
lack of benefit demonstrated with combined  xxxd53xxx  and stenting in the cadillac trial may also
have been a result of the relatively low-risk population, reflected in the overall low mortality rate compared with other primary trials involving percutaneous coronary intervention.

the primary aim of therapy for acute mi is
achievement of complete and timely coronary blood
flow restoration, as restoration of normal antegrade
flow is directly related to reductions in mortality.[4,134] currently, this is achieved with either
primary angioplasty or fibrinolytic therapy, which
achieve timi grade 3 blood flows in approximately
80% and 40% of patients, respectively.[134] the use
of stenting as an adjunct to angioplasty has been
increasing over the past 5 years in the uk and was
used in approximately half of all angioplasty procedures in 1996;[3] intracoronary stenting during primary percutaneous coronary intervention results in a
wider arterial lumen and less infarct-related artery
reocclusion.[4]

additionally, adjunctive use of a platelet gp iib/
iiia antagonist with a fibrinolytic drug is used to
achieve patency and reperfusion of revascularisation
procedures (facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention). the earlier speed and timi-14 studies
showed that combination of a reduced-dose plasminogen activator ( xxxg1766xxx  or reteplase) with  xxxd53xxx  provided myocardial reperfusion greater than
or equivalent to the use of  xxxg1766xxx  or reteplase
alone. the combination of  xxxd53xxx  with reduced
doses of a fibrinolytic agent in the recent gusto-v
and assent-3 studies has resulted in similar or
improved mortality rates to that seen with standard
fibrinolytic therapy, without a concomitant increase
in intracranial haemorrhage or nonfatal disabling
stroke (sections 3.2.2 and 4.2), although the incidence of bleeding was increased.[134] in particular,
the incidence of bleeding in patients aged >75 years
who received a  xxxd53xxx -containing fibrinolytic
regimen was three-times that observed in patients
treated with a heparin-containing regimen. the currently ongoing facilitated intervention with enhanced reperfusion speed to stop events (fi-

long term, the addition of  xxxd53xxx  to stenting
has shown reductions in mortality, repeated targetvessel revascularisation and angiographic restenosis. however, results from the admiral and
cadillac studies appear in opposition to one
another. where the addition of  xxxd53xxx  to stenting
was beneficial in patients with acute mi in the
double-blind admiral study (reducing the prima© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

nesse) trial has been designed to compare therapy
with  xxxd53xxx  either alone or with reteplase in
patients undergoing primary stenting.[135]
overall, it appears that the risk of minor, but not
major, bleeding is increased with  xxxd53xxx  treatment in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
intervention. although the risk of major bleeding
was increased relative to placebo in some pooled
analyses, this is probably due to the inclusion of the
epic study which showed an excess risk of bleeding
in  xxxd53xxx -treated patients.[47] subsequent large
studies (admiral, gusto iv-acs and target) have shown a similar risk of bleeding to that
with placebo with an improved protocol for administration of the drug. however, the risk of bleeding
(both minor and major) is approximately twice that
observed with fibrinolytic therapy alone when
 xxxd53xxx  is combined with a reduced dose of a
fibrinolytic drug. importantly, bleeding events are
costly, second only to cabg surgery; therefore, any
increase in bleeding complications is likely to offset
any potential cost savings achieved by a reduction in
ischaemic endpoints.[136,137]
treatment with  xxxd53xxx  is generally associated
with higher costs than other treatments, such as
 xxxd2017xxx ,  xxxd3385xxx  and revascularisation alone,
primarily because of increased drug acquisition
costs. overall,  xxxd53xxx  has been shown to be cost
effective in patients receiving the drug in conjunction with stenting and in certain groups of patients at
high risk of ischaemic complications. however, this
may not extend to elective procedures, as suggested
by the price cost analysis, where the acquisition
cost of the drug did not appear to be offset by other
costs associated with treatment (see section 5.3).
prospective economic comparisons of  xxxd53xxx ,
 xxxd3385xxx  and  xxxd2017xxx  would help establish the
relative cost effectiveness of the drugs.
in conclusion, an additional body of data has
confirmed that the gp iib/iiia receptor antagonist
 xxxd53xxx  reduces the short- and long-term risk of

ischaemic complications in patients with acs undergoing percutaneous revascularisation when used
against a background of aspirin and heparin. highrisk patients (including those with diabetes mellitus)
derive particular benefits from  xxxd53xxx  treatment.
clinical trials have also shown that adequate
reperfusion is achieved in patients with acute mi
when  xxxd53xxx  is given together with a reduceddose fibrinolytic drug, although with increased rates
of bleeding and thrombocytopenia compared with
the fibrinolytic drug alone.  xxxd53xxx  remains an
important therapeutic option for the prevention of
complications in patients with ischaemic heart disease undergoing revascularisation procedures.
