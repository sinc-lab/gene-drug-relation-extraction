abstract
bisphosphonates are currently the most important class of antiresorptive drugs used for the treatment of diseases with excess
bone resorption. recent studies have shown that bisphosphonates can be divided into two groups with distinct molecular
mechanisms of action depending on the nature of the r2 side
chain. alendronate, like other nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, inhibits bone resorption and causes apoptosis of osteoclasts and other cells in vitro by preventing post-translational
modification of gtp-binding proteins with isoprenoid lipids.  xxxd1721xxx , a bisphosphonate that lacks a nitrogen, does not inhibit
protein isoprenylation but can be metabolized intracellularly to a
␤-␥-methylene (appcp-type) analog of atp, which is cytotoxic to
macrophages in vitro. the detailed molecular basis for the cytotoxic effects of adenosine-5⬘-[␤,␥-dichloromethylene]triphosphate

bone resorption is an essential process of bone modeling
and remodeling in physiological and pathological conditions
and is accomplished by osteoclasts that dissolve the mineral
matrix through proton secretion and the organic matrix
through proteolysis followed by endocytosis and transcytosis
(nesbitt and horton, 1997; salo et al., 1997). ever since the
discovery that bisphosphonates could inhibit bone resorption
(fleisch et al., 1969; smith et al., 1971) more than 30 years
ago, considerable efforts have been made to understand the
molecular mechanisms involved in the mechanisms of action
of these compounds. bisphosphonates are used widely for the
treatment of osteoporosis, paget’s disease, and osteolysis associated with metastatic bone disease. bisphosphonates are
synthetic analogs of pyrophosphate that contain a phosphate-carbon-phosphate backbone. the two side chains attached to the central carbon, r1 and r2, determine the antip.p.l., m.k., j.n.n., k.v.y., h.k.v., and i.e.h. contributed equally to this
work.

(appccl2p) has not been determined yet. we addressed this
question by studying the effects of alendronate,  xxxd1721xxx , and
the  xxxd1721xxx  metabolite appccl2p on isolated mitochondria,
mitochondrial fractions, and mitochondrial membrane potential in
isolated human osteoclasts. we found that appccl2p inhibits
mitochondrial oxygen consumption by a mechanism that involves
competitive inhibition of the adp/atp translocase. alendronate or
the native form of  xxxd1721xxx  did not have any immediate effect on
mitochondria. however, longer treatment with liposome-encapsulated  xxxd1721xxx  caused collapse of the mitochondrial membrane
potential, although prominent apoptosis was a late event. hence,
inhibition of the adp/atp translocase by the metabolite appccl2p
is a likely route by which  xxxd1721xxx  causes osteoclast apoptosis
and inhibits bone resorption.

resorptive potency of bisphosphonates. the r1 chain is
usually a hydroxyl group, which increases the affinity of the
compounds for bone mineral. the r2 chain in the first-generation bisphosphonate drugs is a simple halogen or alkyl
group (och3 in  xxxd2063xxx , ocl in  xxxd1721xxx ). in the second-generation drugs, the r2 side chain contains a primary
amino group, which makes these compounds 10 to 1000 times
more potent (lin, 1996). the third generation of bisphosphonates contains a secondary, tertiary, or quaternary amino
group, within an alkyl chain or a heterocyclic group (rogers
et al., 2000).
it is generally accepted that the most important route by
which bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption is by directly
affecting the bone-resorbing osteoclasts (rodan, 1998; rogers
et al., 2000). bisphosphonates cause disruption of the ruffled
border and actin cytoskeleton of osteoclasts (sato et al., 1991;
rogers et al., 2000) and can cause osteoclast apoptosis
(hughes et al., 1995; selander et al., 1996). the exact molec-

materials and methods
chemicals.  xxxd1721xxx  (dichloromethylene-1,1-bisphosphonate)
and alendronate ( xxxd108xxx )
were kindly provided by leiras pharmaceutical (turku, finland)
and merck (whitehouse station, nj), respectively. the synthesis of
the  xxxd1721xxx  metabolite appccl2p was performed according to a
slightly modified method (blackburn et al., 1984; a. azhayev and j.
vepsäläinen, unpublished data). rhodamine 123 was obtained from
molecular probes (eugene, or), bonkrekic acid (triammonium salt)
from calbiochem (la jolla, ca), and [8-14c] xxxd83xxx 
(nh4 salt) from amersham biosciences uk, ltd. (little chalfont,
buckinghamshire, uk).
preparation of  xxxd1721xxx -loaded liposomes. clodronatecontaining liposomes and nonloaded control liposomes were prepared by the reverse phase evaporation method as described previously (mönkkönen et al., 1994; makkonen et al., 1999).
animals. the work was approved by the laboratory animals
committee of the university of oulu (oulu, finland) and conducted
according to the standards given in the guide for the care and use
of laboratory animals (national institutes of health publication no.
85.23). three-month-old male sprague-dawley rats from the laboratory animal center of the university of oulu were used for isolation of rat liver mitochondria.
mitochondrial preparations. after decapitation, rat liver was
homogenized with a potter-elvehjem homogenizer in ice-cold isolation buffer containing 300 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm egta, and 10 mm
hepes, ph 7.4. the homogenate was centrifuged at 750g for 3 min
and the supernatant centrifuged at 7800g for 10 min. the pellet was
resuspended in the isolation buffer that was at the ratio of 1 ml/g of
liver wet weight. submitochondrial particles were prepared by sonication of liver mitochondria for a total of 25 s in five 5-s bursts
separated by 7-s intervals in an ice bath.
measurement of oxygen consumption. oxygen consumption
was measured in a thermostat-equipped (25°c), sealed chamber with
a clark-type oxygen electrode by adding mitochondria or submitochondrial particles into 0.5 ml of medium consisting of 140 mm kcl,
20 mm hepes, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm egta, 3 mm cacl2
(free ca2⫹ concentration 0.1 ␮m), 3 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm
kh2po4, 5 mm glutamate, and 5 mm malate. adp was added to
stimulate mitochondrial respiration (state 3), as depicted in fig. 1a.
measurement of adenine nucleotide translocation. rat
liver mitochondria were prepared in 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm hepes,
0.5 mm edta, ph 7.4. the “forward exchange” catalyzed by the
adenine nucleotide translocator ( xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx ) was measured (paulson and
shug, 1984) in the presence of 50 or 150 ␮m atp labeled with 14c in

ular mechanisms by which bisphosphonates affect osteoclasts seem to be different for the first generation of bisphosphonates and the second and third generation of
bisphosphonates that contain a nitrogen moiety. alendronate
and other nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates have recently been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts by inhibiting  xxxd2086xxx 
synthase (van beek et al., 1999b; bergström et al., 2000;
dunford et al., 2001), an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway
of cholesterol synthesis. inhibition of this enzyme prevents
the synthesis of isoprenoid lipids required for the prenylation
of small gtp-binding proteins such as rho and rac, necessary for osteoclast function and survival (luckman et al.,
1998; fisher et al., 1999; van beek et al., 1999a; reszka et al.,
1999; coxon et al., 2000). however, the mevalonate pathway
does not seem to be affected by the bisphosphonates that lack
a nitrogen, such as  xxxd1721xxx  (luckman et al., 1998; benford
et al., 1999; van beek et al., 1999a; coxon et al., 2000).).
 xxxd1721xxx  can be metabolized by cells in vitro to a cytotoxic
analog of atp, adenosine-5⬘-[␤,␥-dichloromethylene]triphosphate (appccl2p) (rogers et al., 1994; auriola et al., 1997;
frith et al., 1997; makkonen et al., 1999). the incorporation
of  xxxd1721xxx  into an analog of atp seems to be catalyzed by
a back reaction of class ii aminoacyl-trna synthetases (pelorgeas et al., 1992; rogers et al., 1994, 1996).
the intracellular accumulation of appccl2p may account
for the pharmacological effects of  xxxd1721xxx  on osteoclasts
and macrophages, because appccl2p is just as potent as
 xxxd1721xxx  itself at reducing the viability of macrophages and
preventing cytokine release (frith et al., 1997; makkonen et
al., 1999) in vitro. furthermore, appccl2p has recently been
found to cause osteoclast apoptosis and inhibit bone resorption in vitro (frith et al., 2001). however, the exact molecular
mechanism by which appccl2p affects osteoclast cell viability has not been clarified.
osteoclasts contain large numbers of mitochondria, suggesting that these cells depend on high rates of atp synthesis (karhukorpi et al., 1992). alterations in mitochondrial
membrane permeability have recently been shown to be an
early event in pathways leading to caspase activation and
apoptosis (crompton, 1999; heiskanen et al., 1999; kroemer,
1999).
in this study, we examined whether  xxxd1721xxx  or its metabolite appccl2p may affect osteoclast viability by inhibiting mitochondrial function. we therefore studied the effects
of  xxxd1721xxx  and appccl2p on mitochondrial respiration,
membrane potential, atp synthase (f1fo-atpase), and
adp/atp translocase. appccl2p is shown to inhibit the
adp/atp translocase in the mitochondrial inner membrane,
an effect that could lead to osteoclast apoptosis and hence
inhibition of bone resorption.
we used liposomes for effective delivery of  xxxd1721xxx  to
osteoclasts. this has proved to be an effective means of conveying bisphosphonates to cells, which do not readily internalize these very hydrophilic and negatively charged compounds in their free form. when  xxxd1721xxx  is used clinically
to inhibit osteoclasts, liposomes are not required, because
osteoclasts take up bisphosphonates attached to bone mineral during the resorption, but in vitro there is no bone
mineral present, and therefore liposomes are needed for effective delivery (mönkkönen et al., 1994).

oxygen consumption. neither  xxxd1721xxx  nor alendronate had any effect on mitochondrial oxygen consumption at
concentrations up to 10⫺4 m (data not shown). however, the
 xxxd1721xxx  metabolite appccl2p caused a complete inhibition of the adp stimulation (state 2 to state 3 transition) of
oxygen consumption at a concentration of 5 ⫻ 10⫺4 m, with
half-maximal inhibition occurring at 50 ␮m (fig. 1). the
inhibition appeared after a delay of 30 s. concentrations of
10⫺6 m or less had no effect.
in state 3, mitochondrial respiration is mainly limited by
components of the respiratory chain itself, the adp/atp
translocase, and the pi translocase in the mitochondrial inner membrane. therefore, the potential inhibitory effects of
bisphosphonates or appccl2p were tested in submitochondrial particles, which represent a vesicular, inside-out preparation of the mitochondrial inner membrane in which the
atp synthase (f1fo-atpase) faces outward, and has substrate access without the requirement for translocases in the
mitochondrial membrane. under these conditions, respiration (oxygen consumption) is limited mainly by the respiratory chain. in submitochondrial particles appccl2p at concentrations up to 10⫺4 m did not alter oxygen consumption
(data not shown).
effect of appccl2p on adenine nucleotide translocation. the dose-response curve of the appccl2p inhibition
of  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  is depicted in fig. 2a. in the presence of 50 ␮m atp,
half-maximal inhibition was obtained at 52 ␮m appccl2p.
dixon plots (fig. 2b) indicate that the inhibition is competitive and fitting the data of fig. 4a into the kinetic equation
of competitive inhibition gives a ki value of 72 ␮m, when the
km value for atp influx is 50 ␮m (chan and barbour, 1983).
f1fo-atpase. in leaky submitochondrial particles, an atpsynthase (complex v)-related effect of appccl2p on oxygen consumption could remain undetected. we therefore examined the
effect of appccl2p on the last component of the respiratory
chain, complex v (f1fo-atpase) and found no effect (data not
shown).
effect of appccl2p on mitochondrial membrane potential
in human osteoclasts
the basal fluorescence intensity of rhodamine 123, an indicator of the mitochondrial membrane potential, varied by
20% within the same culture of osteoclasts, possibly due to
differences in mitochondrial or cellular uptake.
when the osteoclasts were exposed to liposome-encapsulated  xxxd1721xxx  at concentrations of 10⫺6 to 10⫺4 m the
mitochondrial membrane potential was not affected, even
after 2 h. liposome-encapsulated appccl2p, however, had a
biphasic effect on the mitochondrial membrane potential of
osteoclasts. initially, the membrane potential increased, as
observed by a decrease in rhodamine 123 fluorescence (fig.
4). then a return to the basal value occurred.
the functionality of the optical readout of membrane potential was tested by the addition of an uncoupler (carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazine), which depolarizes the
mitochondria. an immediate increase in rhodamine 123
fluorescence occurred, confirming the operation of the mitochondrial rhodamine 123 uptake within the range of intra-

nadh, 4 u/ml pyruvate kinase, and 20 u/ml lactate dehydrogenase,
ph 7.4 (rosing et al., 1975). nadh oxidation was monitored by
changes in the relative absorbance at 340 and 385 nm by using a
uv-3000 dual wavelength spectrophotometer (shimadzu, kyoto, japan) at 22°c with an absorption coefficient of 5.33 mm⫺1 cm⫺1. the
activity was determined in the absence and presence of oligomycin
and the difference was attributed to f1fo-atpase.
human osteoclasts. human osteoclasts were prepared from
osteoclastoma by using a method described by nesbitt and horton
(1997). frozen cells were kindly provided by dr. nesbitt. after thawing, the osteoclasts were allowed to attach to 30-mm-diameter glass
coverslips for 1 h in in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), ph 7.0, buffered with 20 mm hepes and containing 0.84 g/l sodium bicarbonate, 2 mm glutamine, 100 iu/ml
penicillin, 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal
calf serum. unattached cells were rinsed away, and the osteoclasts
were cultured in the above-described medium in 5% co2, 95% air at
37°c.
osteoclast culture for resorption activity and apoptosis
measurements. a mixed rat bone cell population was cultured on
 xxxd1721xxx -coated or control bovine bone slices as described previously (boyde et al., 1984; lakkakorpi et al., 1989). for detection of
apoptosis, the cells were stained for  xxxg45xxx  (kit 386a; sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo), a marker for osteoclast phenotype; the nuclei were stained with the dna-binding
fluorochrome  xxxd2284xxx  (sigma-aldrich); and osteoclasts with
fragmented nuclei and shrunken cytoplasm were counted as apoptotic (selander at al., 1994). the percentage of apoptotic cells of total
osteoclasts identified was defined as apoptosis index.
mitochondrial membrane potential in osteoclasts. osteoclasts were loaded with 10 ␮m rhodamine 123 for 15 min in incubation buffer containing 127 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 2 mm mgcl2, 0.5
mm nah2po4, 2 mm cacl2, 5 mm nahco3, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm
hepes, and 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (ph 7.0 in equilibrium with
5% co2).
rhodamine 123 fluorescence was measured with a digital image
analyzer (mcid/m2; imaging research, brock university, st. catharines, on, canada) consisting of an intel 403 e microcomputer
linked to an image 1280 image processor (matrox dorral, qb, canada). the cells were kept at 37°c under a thermostat-equipped hood
(nikon, tokyo, japan). a sony charge-coupled device 72e camera
(dage-mti, michigan city, in) and a ks-1381 signal amplifier (videoscope, washington, dc) were used to collect the data. fluorescence was excited at 495 nm for 500-ms (15 frames for averaging per
excitation) periods at 5-s intervals by using a computer-driven filter
wheel (mac2000; ludl electronic products, hawthorn, ny). emitted light was collected through a dichroic mirror (450–490 nm reflecting) and a 590-nm interference filter (nikon b2a).
under the conditions used the mitochondrial rhodamine 123 concentration rises above the aggregation threshold, leading to fluorescence quenching so that fluorescence increases upon a decrease in
mitochondrial membrane potential (emaus et al., 1986). the zero
potential reference level was achieved by treating the loaded cells
with the uncoupler carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazine.

man osteoclasts even after 2 h, cultures were treated with
10⫺6 m liposome-encapsulated  xxxd1721xxx  for 16 h to increase
the cellular uptake of  xxxd1721xxx  and hence allow sufficient
time for the metabolism of  xxxd1721xxx  to occur, leading to
accumulation of the appccl2p metabolite in the cells, and
then loaded with rhodamine 123. this treatment caused an
80% decrease in the number of osteoclasts in culture. the
remaining osteoclasts had condensed cytoplasm and increased rhodamine 123 fluorescence levels, indicative of the
onset of apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (fig. 4). to evaluate the magnitude of the effect we
determined the average fluorescence intensities of 30 randomly selected osteoclasts from both control and clodronatetreated groups. the selected cells had normal nuclei and did
not demonstrate any other hallmarks of apoptosis. we obdownloaded from molpharm.aspetjournals.org at aspet journals on march 11, 2015

mitochondrial aggregation and fluorescence quenching under
these experimental conditions (emaus et al., 1986). of the
multinucleated osteoclasts, 60% responded this way, displaying an initial 10% decrease in rhodamine 123 fluorescence.
an appccl2p concentration of 10⫺4 m or higher was needed
to observe this effect. at lower concentrations, rhodamine
123 fluorescence remained unaffected even after relatively
long exposures (30 min) (fig. 3). the effect of appccl2p on
 xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  and mitochondrial membrane potential is an immediate
increase due to slowing of potential discharge by the electrogenic  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx . it was, however, of interest to test the effects of
appccl2p on a longer time span, because it is principally
harmful for the mitochondria and cells. to ensure cell targeting of the polar appccl2p molecule it was administered in
liposomes. figure 4 shows that there is a time-dependent
increase in the cellular rhodamine 123 fluorescence, indicating mitochondrial depolarization.

discussion
bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption via a route that
probably involves a direct effect on mature osteoclasts (hughes
et al., 1991; rodan 1998; rogers et al., 2000). however, the
molecular mechanisms by which the nitrogen-containing and
the non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates affect osteoclasts
seem to be different. recently, it has been shown that nitrogencontaining bisphosphonates such as alendronate are inhibitors
of  xxxg778xxx   xxxg888xxx , an enzyme of the mevalonate
pathway (van beek et al., 1999b; bergström et al., 2000; dunford et al., 2001). inhibition of this enzyme leads to loss of the
isoprenoid intermediates  xxxd2086xxx  and  xxxd578xxx , which are essential for the post-translational modification (prenylation) and function of gtp-binding
proteins (luckman et al., 1998). inhibition of protein prenylation, and especially the loss of geranylgeranylated small gtpbinding proteins, inhibits the formation and activity of osteoclasts (fisher et al., 1999; van beek et al., 1999a; coxon et al.,
2000) and can cause activation of caspase-3-like proteases and
apoptosis in osteoclasts and other cell types in vitro (luckman
et al., 1998; benford et al., 1999; reszka et al., 1999). the

served a 40% increase in the average rhodamine fluorescence, indicative of a decrease in mitochondrial membrane
potential. although the variation was large, the difference in
the fluorescence of the mitochondrial membrane potential
probe between untreated cells and cells treated with liposome-encapsulated  xxxd1721xxx  (fig. 4) was statistically significant (p ⬍ 0.0001).
appccl2p has immediate effects on mitochondrial membrane potential (fig. 3). it has been recently shown that
 xxxd1721xxx  is metabolized in osteoclasts, and intracellular
appccl2p has been positively identified (frith et al., 2001).
appccl2p also causes apoptosis (frith et al., 2001), and to
obtain further evidence that the apoptotic cascade would
probably be initiated by mitochondrial effects of appccl2p,
the time courses of the mitochondrial membrane potential
changes were compared with apoptosis in cells growing on
bone slices coated with  xxxd1721xxx , which is taken up by the
cells during resorption. figure 5 shows that  xxxd1721xxx -induced apoptosis is a late effect that is prominent after 24 h,
although it is known that bone resorption is initiated in 4 to
12 h after seeding osteoclasts on  xxxd1721xxx -coated or control
bone slices (lakkakorpi et al., 1989; selander et al., 1994).

drial membrane potential. the direction of the initial change
(an increase in membrane potential) suggests that appccl2p
somehow inhibits the dissipation of the membrane potential.
one consumer of the membrane potential is the electrogenic
adp/atp translocase ( xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx ). inhibition of the  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  would
therefore account for the initial rise in mitochondrial membrane
potential. the subsequent decrease of the membrane potential
is probably due to some secondary adverse effect on the mitochondrial energy state. by studying the exchange of radiolabeled atp into isolated mitochondria, we confirmed that the
 xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  is a target of appccl2p, which is a competitive inhibitor
with respect to atp.
because bisphosphonates are nonhydrolyzable analogs of
pyrophosphate and their adenosine-containing metabolites
(such as appccl2p) are nonhydrolyzable atp analogs, these
compounds could interfere with several aspects of mitochondrial metabolism involving atp. however, our data showed
no effect on f1foatpase or the respiratory chain. in mitochondria, the translocation of pyrophosphate across the inner
membrane is mediated by the  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx , not by the phosphate
carrier (kramer, 1985; woldegiorgis et al., 1985). the nonhydrolyzable atp analog appcp has also been reported to be
translocated into mitochondria by means of the  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  (watanabe et al., 1985). although no reports exit about the transport of its dichloromethylene analog appccl2p, it is possible
that bisphosphonates or their adenosine-containing metabolites are transported into mitochondria, or act as modulators
of the adenylate translocase as our data strongly suggest.
both nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and non-nitrogencontaining bisphosphonates have been found to cause apoptosis
of osteoclasts and macrophages in vitro (hughes et al., 1995;
rogers et al., 1996; selander et al., 1996). early mitochondrial
events in apoptosis include the dissipation of mitochondrial
membrane potential, an increase in mitochondrial ca2⫹, extensive oxidation of mitochondrial nadph, a decrease in cellular
atp, a burst of reactive oxygen species, increased opening of
the mitochondrial permeability transition (pt) pore, and release of  xxxg569xxx  (heiskanen et al., 1999) and other proapoptotic factors into the extramitochondrial space (for a recent
review, see crompton, 1999).  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  forms the pt pore when
associated with  xxxg798xxx -d in the mitochondrial matrix and
the nonselective voltage-dependent anion channel in the mitochondrial outer membrane (voltage-dependent anion channel is
located at the contact points between the inner membrane cristae and the outer membrane). cyclosporin-a (a ligand of with
 xxxg798xxx -d) and some inhibitors of the  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  inhibit pt pore
formation, whereas other  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  inhibitors increase the probability of pore opening (zamzami et al., 1996; chavez et al., 1999).
formation of the pt pore also is linked to cell death upon
ischemia reperfusion. it has been reported that anoxic damage
of mitochondria is prevented by atp, adp, and nonhydrolyzable appcp, which is translocated by  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  (watanabe et al.,
1985). atp and adp are known to inhibit pt pore opening
(halestrap et al., 1997). it is assumed that this occurs by atp
binding to the outside of the inner mitochondrial membrane
and adp on the inner side of the membrane. because the  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx 
is clearly involved in controlling the pt pore and hence in the
regulation of apoptosis, it could therefore be a target of appcptype metabolites of the non-nitrogen-bisphosphonates such as
 xxxd1721xxx . our data indicate that the  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  is indeed inhibited
by appccl2p, a metabolite of  xxxd1721xxx . by inhibiting the
 xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx , appccl2p could also cause opening of the pt pore and

non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates such as  xxxd1721xxx ,
however, do not inhibit the mevalonate pathway and have no
effect on protein prenylation (luckman et al., 1998; benford et
al., 1999; fisher et al., 1999; van beek et al., 1999a; coxon et al.,
2000). furthermore, some studies have suggested that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (at high concentrations) can
affect both mature osteoclasts and precursors in vitro, whereas
 xxxd1721xxx  affects mainly mature osteoclasts (boonekamp et al.,
1986, 1987; lowik et al., 1988) and can cause osteoclast apoptosis (hughes et al., 1995; selander et al., 1996). the mechanism by which  xxxd1721xxx  affects mature osteoclasts and causes
osteoclast apoptosis remains unknown. however, one route
could involve the formation of an adenosine-5⬘-[␤,␥-methylene]
triphosphate (appcp-type) metabolite, which is not formed
from any of the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates studied to
date (auriola et al., 1997; frith et al., 1997; benford et al., 1999).
the formation of appccl2p could account for the cytotoxic effects
of  xxxd1721xxx  (reitsma et al., 1982; flanagan and chambers,
1989), because appccl2p is as effective as  xxxd1721xxx  at reducing
the viability of macrophages in vitro (frith et al., 1997).
we describe in this report an inhibitory effect of appccl2p,
but not  xxxd1721xxx , on mitochondrial respiration by intact mitochondria. the effect is not detectable using submitochondrial
particles, which represent an inside-out preparation of the mitochondrial inner membrane. we could not demonstrate any
effect on any of the components of the mitochondrial respiratory
complex. instead, we observed a biphasic effect on mitochon-

mechanism of action of  xxxd1721xxx 

accumulation rate of appccl2p is rather slow, so that its maximum concentration is reached after 12 h of exposure of macrophages in culture to liposomal  xxxd1721xxx  (mönkkönen et al.,
2001). in a long-term experiment with a gradual increase of the
inhibitor the acute effect (i.e., an initial increase in mitochondrial membrane potential due to lowered dissipation of the
membrane energy charge by  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  and f1fo-atpase would be
difficult to observe).
our present data clarify the likely molecular mechanism by
which  xxxd1721xxx  causes osteoclast apoptosis, owing to the formation of the metabolite appccl2p. the latter, by inhibiting
the mitochondrial  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx , causes mitochondrial membrane depolarization and subsequent events such as  xxxg569xxx  release
and caspase activation (heiskanen et al., 1999; benford et al.,
2001), leading to cell death. the previous observation that  xxxd1721xxx  causes apoptosis more rapidly than the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates can thus be explained as follows. the
nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates act primarily by affecting
the proton pumping and intracellular vesicular trafficking in
the osteoclast. this leads to a subsequent change in osteoclast
metabolism resulting from the inhibition of cell function. consequently, the apoptotic mechanism is initiated (selander et al.,
1996). the faster action of  xxxd1721xxx  is compatible with the
present results, indicating binding of the  xxxd1721xxx  metabolite
to the c-state of  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  and direct apoptotic signaling via mitochondria. thus, based on evidence presented herein and else-

taken up by osteoclasts, and a ph gradient across
the basal membrane causes intracellular enrichment of the drug. b,  xxxd1721xxx  is converted to

inhibition of adp/atp translocator interferes with
the membrane potential conversion leading to an
initial hyperpolarization. e, inhibition of the adp/
atp translocator in the c-mode causes subsequent
opening of the mitochondrial pt pore, leading to loss
of mitochondrial matrix constituents and disappearance of the chemical and electric gradients. these
processes lead to release of mitochondrial proapoptotic factors, including  xxxg569xxx  (cyt c) and commencement of apoptosis. mom, mitochondrial outer

hence cause apoptosis. in its translocating function,  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  alternates between two conformations with the adenylate binding
site either on the mitochondrial matrix side (m-state) or on the
cytosolic side (c-state) (schultheiss and klingenberg, 1984). the
effect of  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  inhibition on pt pore formation depends on
whether the ligands bind to the m-state or c-state. ligands
binding to the m-state inhibit the formation of the pt pore and
ligands binding to the c-state induce the formation of the pt
pore (zamzami et al., 1996; chavez et al., 1999). if appccl2p
acts as an enhancer of pt pore formation, it would be expected
to do this by acting as a ligand binding to the c-state of the  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx 
(i.e., acting on the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial membrane). thus, the proapoptotic effects of appccl2p may be similar to that of the other  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  inhibitors.
the concentrations of appccl2p that were needed to affect
the  xxxg2126xxx   xxxg2128xxx  (ic50 ⫽ 50 ␮m) and disrupt mitochondrial membrane
potential in our studies were reasonably low. mönkkönen et al.
(2001) found that appccl2p can reach concentrations as high as
1 mm in  xxxd1721xxx -treated cells in vitro. furthermore, owing to
the targeting of bisphosphonates to sites of resorption and selective uptake by osteoclasts (for review, see rogers et al., 2000),
high intracellular concentrations of  xxxd1721xxx  and its metabolite could be achieved in osteoclasts in vivo. moreover, if the
translocation of bisphosphonate would occur in the protonated
form, the high proton gradient across the basal membrane
would force an intracellular enrichment of the compound. the
