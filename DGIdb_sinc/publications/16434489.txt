neoplasia

 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) inhibits kitd816v, an imatinib-resistant
activating mutation that triggers neoplastic growth in most patients
with systemic mastocytosis
neil p. shah, francis y. lee, roger luo, yibin jiang, marjolein donker, and cem akin

mastocytosis is associated with an activating mutation in the kit oncoprotein
(kitd816v) that results in autophosphorylation of the kit receptor in a ligandindependent manner. this mutation is
inherently resistant to imatinib and, to
date, there remains no effective curative
therapy for systemic mastocytosis associated with kitd816v.  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) is a novel orally bioavailable src/
abl inhibitor that has activity against
multiple imatinib-resistant bcr-abl isoforms in vitro that is presently showing
considerable promise in early-phase clinical trials of chronic myeloid leukemia

(cml). pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that high nanomolar concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  can be achieved safely
in humans. in this study, we demonstrate
significant inhibitory activity of  xxxd1815xxx 
against both wild-type kit and the kitd816v
mutation in the nanomolar range in in
vitro and cell-based kinase assays. additionally,  xxxd1815xxx  leads to growth inhibition of a kitd816v-harboring human mastocytosis cell line. significantly,  xxxd1815xxx 
selectively kills primary neoplastic bone
marrow mast cells from patients with
systemic mastocytosis while sparing
other hematopoietic cells. computer mod-

eling suggests that the kitd816v mutation
destabilizes the inactive conformation of
the kit activation loop to which imatinib
binds, but it is not predicted to impair
binding of kit by  xxxd1815xxx . based upon
our results, further evaluation of  xxxd1815xxx  for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis in clinical trials is warranted. moreover,  xxxd1815xxx  may be of clinical utility in
other disease settings driven by activating kit mutations. (blood. 2006;108:

introduction
systemic mastocytosis and mast-cell leukemia are relatively rare
conditions that are characterized by a pathologic accumulation of
mast cells in various tissues.1 previous work has demonstrated the
clonal nature of the disorder as evidenced by an activating point
mutation in the kit receptor  xxxg2198xxx .2,3 this mutation,
kitd816v, occurs near the activation loop of the kinase and can be
identified in more than 80% of systemic mastocytosis cases and
thus represents an attractive target for this disorder, for which few
effective therapeutic options exist.1 although a small molecule
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor of kit,  xxxd2333xxx , has been
available to patients recently, both preclinical and clinical studies
have demonstrated convincingly that the kitd816v mutation is
inherently resistant to imatinib.4-6 the crystal structure of the
wild-type kit kinase domain has been solved in an autoinhibited
state, with the activation loop of the kinase in a closed
conformation,7 similar to the cocrystal structure of imatinib
bound to the abl kinase domain.7,8 these structural studies
suggest that substitution of valine for  xxxd233xxx  at position
816 in kit may alter the conformation of the activation loop and
thus prevent imatinib from efficiently binding to kitd816v.

inhibition of kitd816v has thus become the focus of recent studies
aiming to find a curative therapy for mast-cell disease, and several
potential drug candidates with an ability to inhibit kitd816v have
been identified.9-15
 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) is a novel, potent, oral, multitargeted
kinase inhibitor that targets abl, src, kit, pdgfr, and other
tyrosine kinases.  xxxd1815xxx  is structurally unrelated to imatinib16
and is currently showing great promise for the treatment of all
stages of imatinib-resistant and -intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) in early clinical development. the cocrystal structure
of  xxxd1815xxx  bound to the kinase domain of abl reveals that the
compound binds to the active conformation of the kinase and, in
contrast to imatinib, is not expected to be susceptible to alterations
in the activation loop.17 this is supported by the observed
inhibitory activity of  xxxd1815xxx  against 18 of 19 bcr-abl
mutations known to confer imatinib resistance, including those that
result in conformational changes to the kinase.16,18 we therefore
hypothesized that  xxxd1815xxx  would bind to kit regardless of the
conformation of the kit activation loop and sought to evaluate
 xxxd1815xxx  for potential activity in mastocytosis.

here we provide preclinical evidence of effective binding of
 xxxd1815xxx  to wild-type kit at a concentration approximately
20-fold lower than that required for imatinib. furthermore, we
observed inhibition of kitd816v by  xxxd1815xxx  in in vitro kinase
activity assays, which correlated with inhibition of growth of
neoplastic cell lines carrying this mutation. last, we provide
evidence for efficient killing of primary human neoplastic mast
cells carrying kitd816v ex vivo at concentrations that are safely
achievable in humans. these studies clearly indicate that clinical
trials to assess  xxxd1815xxx  for the treatment of aggressive variants of
systemic mastocytosis are warranted.

materials and methods
inhibitors
imatinib was provided by novartis (basel, switzerland).  xxxd1815xxx  was
provided by bristol-myers squibb oncology (princeton, nj).
in vitro kinase assay
gst ( xxxg1073xxx )–tagged kit or kit d816v (amino acids
544-end) (5 to 10 mu) was incubated with 8 mm mops (ph 7.0), 0.2 mm
edta, 10 mm mncl2, 0.1 mg/ml poly(glu/tyr) (4:1), 10 mm magnesium
acetate, and [␥-33p-atp] (specific activity approximately 500 cpm/pmol) in
a final reaction volume of 25 ␮l (kinase profile; upstate, dundee, united
kingdom). the reaction was initiated by the addition of the magnesiumatp mix. after incubation for 40 minutes at room temperature, the reaction
was stopped by the addition of 5 ␮l of a 3% phosphoric acid solution. next,
10 ␮l of the reaction was spotted onto a filtermat a and washed 3 times for
5 minutes in 75 mm phosphoric acid and once in methanol prior to drying
and scintillation counting.
cell-based kinase assay
aliquots of 1 ⫻ 106 to 5 ⫻ 106 cells were serum starved for 3 hours and
incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of inhibitors for 1 hour
in iscove medium. cells were then lysed in 1% triton containing the
following protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described19: complete
protease inhibitor cocktail (4 tablets per 10 ml) (roche molecular
biochemicals, indianapolis, in), sigma protease inhibitor cocktail (500
␮l/ml) (sigma, st louis, mo), 3,4 dichloroisocoumarin (50 ␮g/ml)
(roche molecular biochemicals), and  xxxd302xxx  (1 mm); and the
following phosphatase inhibitors: sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), sodium
pyrophosphate (5.4 mm), and sodium fluoride (50 mm) (sigma). cells
were lysed by adding an equal amount of the lysis buffer to cell suspension
and passing several times through a 20-gauge needle, boiled for 5 minutes,
and spun at 16 000g for 5 minutes. twenty microliters of lysate was
electrophoresed on a 4% to 12% nupage bis-tris gel. western blot
analysis was performed using [py823] phosphospecific anti-kit (biosource, camarillo, ca) or the anti-kit antibodies (clone 57a5; calbiochem, san diego, ca).
cell lines
the murine p815 mastocytoma cell line expressing the d814v mutation
(corresponding to human d816v) was purchased from american type
culture collection ([atcc] manassas, va). the cells were cultured in
rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) and
25 mm hepes buffer at 37°c, 5% co2.
two previously described subclones of the human mastocytosis cell line
hmc-1 were kindly provided by dr joseph butterfield (mayo clinic).20
hmc-1.1v560g⫹, d816v⫺ cells harbor only the activating mutation kitv560g,
and hmc-1.2v560g⫹, d816v⫹ cells harbor the d816v mutation in addition.
both cell lines were propagated in iscove medium supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum.

287

cell growth inhibition assays
hmc cell lines were plated at 2 ⫻ 105/ml in the presence of varying
concentrations of inhibitors. after 24, 48, and 72 hours, viable cells were
counted by trypan blue dye exclusion.  xxxg166xxx  staining was performed
using a commercially available kit according to manufacturer’s instructions
(r&d systems, minneapolis, mn), and the cells were analyzed on a flow
cytometer (facscalibur, becton dickinson, san jose, ca).
p815 cells were plated at a density of 4 ⫻ 104 cells per well and grown
overnight. compounds were then added, and after 24, 48, and 72 hours, cell
growth was determined by direct counting using a coulter channelyzer
(beckman coulter, miami, fl).
mutational analysis and ex vivo human neoplastic mast-cell
cytotoxicity assays
after obtaining informed consent on a clinical protocol approved by the
institutional review board of the university of michigan, 5 to 10 ml of
bone marrow aspirate was harvested from 4 patients with indolent systemic
mastocytosis. for mutational analysis studies, mast cells were enriched by
cd25⫹ magnetic bead selection as described.5 briefly, bone marrow
mononuclear cells were incubated with cd25 paramagnetic beads (miltenyi biotec, auburn, ca) for 30 minutes at 8°c in pbs containing 2 mm
edta and 0.1% bsa, and the cd25⫹ cells were isolated using a minimacs
column according to manufacturer’s instructions. the eluted cells were
centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes, and the pellet was lysed in 0.8 ml trizol
reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). total rna was reverse transcribed to
cdna by superscript ii kit (invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
guidelines. the presence of the kitd816v mutation in synthesized cdna
was demonstrated by polyerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of this
region, followed by restriction digestion with hinfi and haeiii as previously described.21
for ex vivo culture studies, bone marrow mononuclear cells were
isolated by histopaque (density 1.077) gradient centrifugation for 30
minutes, washed once in stem-pro serumfree medium, and cultured at a
density of 1 ⫻ 106/ml in 1 ml stem-pro serumfree medium for 7 days with
or without inhibitors. mast cells in bone marrow cultures were identified by
flow cytometry as a  xxxg1279xxx ⫹-high, side scatter–high population as previously described.5 briefly, bone marrow mononuclear cells were incubated
in 100 ␮l aliquots for 30 minutes at 4°c with a phycoerythrin (pe)
conjugate of anti–human  xxxg1279xxx  (clone 104d2; becton dickinson). the
cells were then washed, resuspended in pbs containing 0.1% bsa, and
analyzed on a flow cytometer (facscalibur, becton dickinson). the
percentage of mast cells in the mononuclear-cell population was then
determined in cultures with or without inhibitors. mast-cell percentage
results were normalized to the counts obtained in the absence of
inhibitors. mast cells constituted 0.08% to 0.7% of the mononuclear
cells in untreated cultures.
computer modeling of imatinib and  xxxd1815xxx  in the kit
kinase domain
imatinib was superimposed upon the crystal structure of the inactive
conformation of kit (pdb code 1t4622).  xxxd1815xxx  is structurally similar to
the src/abl kinase inhibitor pd173955.23 modeling was performed by
superimposing the active conformation of kit (pdb code 1pkg 7) onto the
structure of abl kinase in complex with pd173955 (pdb code 1m52)
and aligning a model of  xxxd1815xxx  on the position of pd173955. small
adjustments of  xxxd1815xxx  with respect to 1pkg were made to remove
steric clashes.

the abilities of imatinib and  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit the kinase
activity of kit in vitro were compared. figure 1 and table 1

544-end). ic50 was calculated by regression analysis.

kit approximately 20-fold more efficiently than imatinib.
significantly,  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits the kinase activity of kitd816v
with comparable efficiency to wild-type kit (ic50 of 37 and 79
nm, respectively) in in vitro kinase experiments, whereas
the ability of imatinib to inhibit kitd816v kinase activity is
highly impaired.
to assess for inhibition of kitd816v kinase activity by
 xxxd1815xxx  in vivo, hmc-1.1 v560g⫹, d816v⫺ and hmc1.2v560g⫹, d816v⫹ human mast-cell leukemia cells carrying v560g
and d816v mutations were incubated in the presence of varying
concentrations of the compound, and  xxxd1075xxx -associated
kit was assessed. inhibition of kitv560g (hmc-1.1v560g⫹, d816v⫺)
autophosphorylation was noted at concentrations significantly
lower than those observed for imatinib, with inhibition of phosphokit at concentrations as low as 10 nm. while imatinib failed to
inhibit kitv560g, d816v (hmc-1.2v560g⫹, d816v⫹) autophosphorylation at concentrations of up to 1 ␮m,  xxxd1815xxx  resulted in
substantially decreased levels of phospho-kit in the high nanomolar range (figure 2a).
growth inhibition assays of the hmc-1.1v560g⫹, d816v⫺ and
hmc-1.2v560g⫹, d816v⫹ cell lines were also performed and reveal
that, consistent with previous studies, imatinib harbors activity
against hmc-1.1v560g⫹, d816v⫺ at high nanomolar concentrations
but has no detectable effect on growth inhibition of kitd816vharboring hmc-1.2v560g⫹, d816v⫹ cells at concentrations up to 1
␮m. in contrast,  xxxd1815xxx  suppresses the growth of hmc1.1v560g⫹, d816v⫺ cells in the low nanomolar range and is approximately 5 times more potent than imatinib in this assay. furthermore,  xxxd1815xxx  retains activity against hmc-1.2v560g⫹, d816v⫹
cells, although higher concentrations are required (figure 2b).
 xxxd1815xxx  also shows a strong growth inhibitory activity against
the p815 rodent mastocytoma line, which carries kitd814v, the
murine equivalent of kit d816v.
because studies with the cell lines may not reflect the true
sensitivity of neoplastic bone marrow primary mast cells, experiments were performed with primary bone marrow cells from
patients with systemic mastocytosis. the presence of the kitd816v
mutation was documented by reverse transcriptase (rt)–pcr of
the corresponding region of kit followed by restriction enzyme
digestion with hinfi (figure 3a) in cd25⫹ mast-cell–enriched

bone marrow samples from all patients. to assess whether primary
human neoplastic mast cells that harbor kitd816v are sensitive to
 xxxd1815xxx , a flow cytometry–based assay of mast-cell viability was
employed. previous studies showed an excellent correlation of
the results of mast-cell viability in this assay with inhibition of
kit kinase activity, which was also associated with clinical
response in one report.5,24 using this assay system, clear
preferential cytotoxicity to neoplastic mast cells was demonstrated in bone marrow mononuclear-cell cultures established
from patients with mastocytosis in the presence of  xxxd1815xxx  at
0.1 ␮m concentration, with increased activity observed at 1 ␮m. in
contrast, imatinib had no significant activity at 1 ␮m, as expected
(figure 3b).
to understand how  xxxd1815xxx  may be capable of binding to kit
even in the presence of the d816v mutation, we compared the
crystal structure of imatinib bound to kit with a model of  xxxd1815xxx 
bound to the kit kinase domain (figure 4).  xxxd816xxx  resides within
the activation loop of kit and is important for maintaining the
inactive conformation that imatinib prefers by forming a hydrogen
bond with n819. replacement of this  xxxd233xxx  residue with
valine breaks this bond and thereby destabilizes the inactive
conformation, thus preventing imatinib from binding.  xxxd1815xxx 
binds to the active conformation of abl and is predicted to bind
kit in a similar manner. because this conformation does not
depend on interactions of  xxxd816xxx , the d816v mutation would not be
expected to have a drastic effect on the ability of  xxxd1815xxx  to bind
and inhibit kit activity.

discussion
mastocytosis is a disease with remarkable variation in its clinical
course and prognosis. while symptomatic management is recommended to patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis, mast-cell
cytoreductive therapy is indicated for the aggressive variants of
systemic mastocytosis associated with poorer prognoses.25 the
current options for cytoreductive therapy of mastocytosis include
interferon alfa-2b26 and cladribine.27 while these drugs can at least
temporarily halt the progression of disease and lead to a variable
degree of mast-cell cytoreduction, they are not uniformly effective
in all patients and their use is fraught with poor tolerability and
potentially serious adverse effects.
the promise of targeted inhibition of oncogenic tyrosine
kinases for the effective treatment of human malignancy has
been validated in many disease settings. imatinib inhibits
wild-type kit as well as kit with transmembrane and juxtamembrane mutations,4-6 and this inhibition is associated with therapeutic activity in tumors, including gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (gist) and an unusual case of mastocytosis driven by
these mutations.24,28 while plasma concentrations of imatinib in
the low micromolar range can be safely achieved in humans,29

inhibition of kitd816v is not obtained at these drug concentrations.4,5 given the high association of this activating point
mutation with the clear majority of systemic mastocytosis cases,
identification of novel compounds with the ability to inhibit the
activity of this mutant kinase is expected to result in great
therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of this currently incurable
disorder. indeed,  xxxd2642xxx , another small molecular weight
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor with in vitro efficacy against kit d816v,
has produced a transient clinical response in a patient with an
aggressive mast-cell leukemia bearing this mutation.9 this
report, together with an earlier report of induction of complete
remission of a patient with mastocytosis carrying a transmembrane kit f522c mutation24 and treated with imatinib, provided
proof of principle that kit in mast-cell disease represents a
valid pharmacologic target.
 xxxd1815xxx  is a thiazolecarboxamide that is presently in phase
2 clinical trials for the treatment of imatinib-resistant and
-intolerant cases of cml and in phase 1 trials for solid tumors.
here we provide evidence of significant preclinical activity of
this compound against kitd816v in the high nanomolar range.
our experiments indicate that 100 nm  xxxd1815xxx  is sufficient to
not only inhibit the kinase activity of wild-type kit and
kitd816v but is also preferentially toxic to primary neoplastic
mast cells as compared with other hematopoietic cells in the ex
vivo culture system. pharmacokinetic studies performed during
a phase 1 dose-escalation study of  xxxd1815xxx  have demonstrated

that high nanomolar concentrations of the compound can be
safely achieved in humans.
imatinib is the prototype small molecule  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor, and it appears that this compound binds to select kinases
when in the inactive conformation and “freezes” the kinase in this
state. it has been postulated that the safety and tolerability of
imatinib is a reflection of its “conformation-restricted” binding.
however, studies of acquired resistance cases to imatinib,30-39 and
to other small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors such as gefitinib40,41 and erlotinib41 currently employed for the treatment of
human malignancy, clearly implicate the acquisition of secondary
kinase domain mutations as the predominant molecular mechanism
of resistance. because many of these secondary mutations are
thought to impair the ability of the target kinase to adopt the
inactive conformation to which imatinib binds, “conformationtolerant” compounds such as  xxxd1815xxx  are expected to be less
susceptible to subtle alterations in the kinase domain.42 furthermore, mutations near the activation loop of target kinases, such as
the activating kitd816v mutation that drives systemic mastocytosis
as well as some cases of gist, are expected to have little effect on
the inhibitory activity of active conformation binders such as
 xxxd1815xxx . indeed, both preclinical as well as early clinical evidence
obtained from a phase 1 clinical trial suggest that nearly all
imatinib-resistant bcr-abl mutations are sensitive to  xxxd1815xxx .

efficacy of  xxxd1815xxx  for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis are
clearly warranted.
in our experiments, a higher  xxxd1815xxx  concentration was
required to inhibit the kinase activity and cell growth of hmc1.2v560g⫹, d816v⫹ cells than hmc-1.1v560g⫹, d816v⫺ cells. in light of
the equivalent potency of  xxxd1815xxx  against wild-type kit and
kitd816v in in vitro kinase assays, coupled with the observation
that the rodent mastocytoma cell line is highly sensitive to
 xxxd1815xxx , the reason for this discrepancy is presently unclear. it is
possible that the compound v560g and d816v kit mutations
present in hmc-1.2v560g⫹, d816v⫹ cells may alter the kit kinase
domain conformation and make binding by  xxxd1815xxx  less favorable. notably, most cases of mastocytosis are associated with a

single activating kit mutation, and the sensitivity of primary
neoplastic mast cells isolated from mastocytosis patients presented
in this study further supports the promise of  xxxd1815xxx  for patients
with systemic mastocytosis.
a recent study showed that  xxxd1815xxx  was bound to 47 of 148
kinases with high affinity (kd less than 200 nm).43 despite the
apparent promiscuity of the drug,  xxxd1815xxx  appears to be generally
well tolerated in patients with cml. this apparent paradox may be
due to the short biologic half-life of the drug, which, while
sufficient for efficacy, may limit toxicity. it is possible that the
higher peak concentrations necessary to inhibit kit activity will
require more aggressive dosing, and the promise of this drug for
systemic mastocytosis cases will depend to a large extent upon its
safety and tolerability at higher doses, which remain to be
established. the chemotype of  xxxd1815xxx , which is distinct from
that of imatinib and amn107 in its ability to bind to the kit
kinase domain in the active conformation, should facilitate the
development of kit inhibitors that harbor even greater selectivity and potency.
finally, some patients meeting the world health organization (who) criteria for systemic mastocytosis may carry the
fip1l1- xxxg1709xxx  fusion gene instead of kitd816v.44 these
patients present with a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by prominent eosinophilia and mast-cell dysplasia. while
these patients respond to imatinib, resistance to this drug may
emerge by acquiring point mutations in the kinase domain of
 xxxg1709xxx .45  xxxd2642xxx , a drug capable of inhibiting the kitd816v,
has also shown to be effective for the  xxxg1709xxx  mutants
resistant to imatinib.46  xxxd1815xxx  binds  xxxg1709xxx  with high
affinity43 although it is not known whether the drug will have
any efficacy on fip1l1- xxxg1709xxx –associated myeloproliferative disease. however, based on structural similarity of  xxxg1709xxx  and kit, the drug may also have activity in cases of
systemic mastocytosis associated with the fip1l1- xxxg1709xxx 
fusion gene, including cases of imatinib resistance.  xxxd1815xxx 
thus offers significant promise for systemic mastocytosis, and
clinical trials are currently ongoing.

figure 4. ribbon representations of kit. (a) the
crystal structure of an inactive conformation of kit bound
to imatinib (green) is shown.7 the activation loop, shown
in the inactive state, is depicted in blue. the positions of
 xxxd816xxx  and n819 are shown as well as the hydrogen bond
formed between these residues, which stabilizes the
inactive conformation. (b) the active conformation of kit
is shown, with  xxxd1815xxx  (yellow) modeled into the active
site. the activation loop (red) is depicted in the active
conformation.
