summary  xxxd2655xxx  (mmc) is a prototype bioreductive drug employed to treat a variety of cancers including head and neck cancer.
among the various enzymes,  xxxd1875xxx  inhibitable cytosolic nad(p)h:quinone oxidoreductase1 ( xxxg1592xxx ) was shown to catalyse
bioreductive activation of mmc leading to cross-linking of the dna and cytotoxicity. however, the role of  xxxg1592xxx  in metabolic activation of mmc
has been disputed. in this report, we present cellular and animal models to demonstrate that  xxxg1592xxx  may play only a minor role in metabolic
activation of mmc. we further demonstrate that bioreductive activation of mmc is catalysed by a unique cytosolic activity which is related but
distinct from  xxxg1592xxx . chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells were developed that permanently express higher levels of cdna-derived  xxxg1592xxx .
these cells showed significantly increased protection against  xxxd2563xxx  toxicity. however, they failed to demonstrate higher cytotoxicity due
to exposure to mmc under oxygen (normal air) or hypoxia, as compared to the wild-type control cho cells. disruption of the  xxxg1592xxx  gene by
homologous recombination generated  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice that do not express the  xxxg1592xxx  gene resulting in the loss of  xxxg1592xxx  protein and activity.
the cytosolic fractions from liver and colon tissues of  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice showed similar amounts of dna cross-linking upon exposure to mmc,
as observed in  xxxg1592xxx +/+ mice. the unique cytosolic activity that activated mmc in cytosolic fractions of liver and colon tissues of  xxxg1592xxx –/–
mice was designated as cytosolic mmc reductase. this activity, like  xxxg1592xxx , was inhibited by  xxxd1875xxx  and immunologically related to

bioreductive chemotherapy plays an important role in treatment of
many human diseases including certain types of cancer (sartorelli,
1988; ross et al, 1994; workman, 1994; rauth et al, 1997). the
development of these drugs is based upon specific reductase
enzymes and the identification of tumour types that are rich in
those enzymes. in addition, it is also based on differences in
oxygen content and cellular ph between normal and tumour
tissues (ross et al, 1994). several quinones (e.g.  xxxd2655xxx 
(mmc) and indoloquinone  xxxd195xxx ) and dinitrophenylaziridine
 xxxd3416xxx  occupy a special place in bioreductive therapy because of
their tendency to undergo reductive activation by different reductases in aerobic and hypoxic conditions. mmc and its analogues
are effective against several tumour tissue types including colon,
breast and head and neck (verweij and pinedo, 1990).
among the various reductases, the role of nad(p)h:quinone
oxidoreductase1 ( xxxg1592xxx ) in bioreductive chemotherapy was
extensively studied. most of the studies were done for mmc.
however,  xxxg1592xxx  enzyme has also been demonstrated for the
activation of  xxxd3416xxx  (knox et al, 1988), diaziquinone (siegel
et al, 1990), and the indoloquinone  xxxd195xxx  (workman, 1994).
bioreductive metabolism leading to the formation of electrophilic
metabolites capable of binding with dna to cause its damage is
the basic cause of cytotoxicity and anti-tumour activity of mmc
(iyer and szybalski, 1964). several studies used  xxxd1875xxx

inhibition of  xxxg1592xxx  to demonstrate that  xxxg1592xxx  is important for the
cytotoxicity of mmc under aerobic conditions (siegel et al, 1990;
dulhanty and whitmore, 1991; marshall et al, 1991). however,
the actual involvement of  xxxg1592xxx  enzyme in the activation of
mmc remains controversial (workman, 1994). although as
mentioned earlier, there are a number of model systems where
aerobic resistance to mmc correlates with a loss of  xxxg1592xxx  activity
(fitzsimmons et al, 1996), a lack of correlation was reported in the
‘oxford’ panel of 15 cell lines (robertson et al, 1992). more
recent data using cells expressing higher levels of cdna-derived
 xxxg1592xxx  failed to demonstrate increased sensitivity to mmc, as
compared to cells of similar origin containing normal levels of
 xxxg1592xxx  (powis et al, 1995; joseph et al, 1996). the role of  xxxg1592xxx 
in activation of mmc under hypoxic conditions is also questionable (workman, 1994). this is clearly evident by the observation
of high sensitivity of human colon carcinoma (be) cells that lack
 xxxg1592xxx  to mmc and indoloquinone  xxxd195xxx  in hypoxia (plumb and
workman, 1994).
in this report, we present evidence to demonstrate that a unique
cytosolic enzyme distinct from  xxxg1592xxx  catalyses reductive activation of mmc. these include: (1) the cho cells permanently overexpressing cdna-derived  xxxg1592xxx  failed to demonstrate higher
sensitivity to mmc, as compared to control cho cells; and (2) the
cytosolic extracts from liver and colon of  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice showed
more or less similar amounts of mmc-induced dna crosslinking, as compared with cytosolic extracts of wild-type
( xxxg1592xxx +/+) mice. further experiments revealed that cytosolic
mmc reductase is inhibited by  xxxd1875xxx  and is immunologically related to cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx .

materials
the chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells were obtained from
american type culture collection (atcc, rockville, md, usa).
mmc was a gift from bristol myers squibb (princeton, nj, usa).
polyclonal antibodies against purified full-length  xxxg1592xxx  protein
was raised in rabbits in our laboratory. the  xxxg1592xxx  antibodies
cross-react with cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  and  xxxg1593xxx  proteins from rodents
and human (jaiswal et al, 1990; shaw et al, 1991).
development of cho cells stably expressing high
levels of cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  activity
the human  xxxg1592xxx  cdna was subcloned in ped4 vector
(kaufman et al, 1991) to generate ped4- xxxg1592xxx  recombinant
plasmid. the cho cells were grown in 5% carbon dioxide at 37°c
in iscove’s dulbecco’s modified essential medium (dmem)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm hypoxanthine,
0.01 mm thymidine, 50 µl ml–1 streptomycin and 2 mm
glutathione. ped4- xxxg1592xxx  plasmid dna was linearized by digestion with nde1 and transfected in cho cells as described previously (shaw et al, 1991). sixty-two hours after transfection, the
cells were washed with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (pbs)
trypsinized and plated in medium deficient in thymidine and
hypoxanthine at different dilutions of 1:5, 1:10, 1:20 and 1:40. a
portion of cells were analysed for  xxxg1592xxx  activity by a previously
described method (shaw et al, 1991). the cells were allowed to
grow in medium deficient in thymidine and hypoxanthine for 14
days. during this period, the medium was changed every third day.
after 14 days, the colonies were visible. they were picked and
expanded in 24-well plates. selection of cho cells continued in
medium containing methotrexate at concentrations of 0.02, 0.1
and 0.5 µm. all the clones selected at various stages of
methotrexate treatment were analysed for  xxxg1592xxx  activity. three of
these clones cho ( xxxg1592xxx -13), cho ( xxxg1592xxx -38) and cho
( xxxg1592xxx -3682) expressing 13-, 38- and 3682-fold higher levels of
 xxxg1592xxx , as compared with wild-type control cho cells, were
selected for further studies. the selected cho cell clones were
grown in medium deficient in methotrexate for 4 weeks without
loss of  xxxg1592xxx  activity.
cytotoxicity assays
the wild-type control cho cells and the three cho cell clones
expressing varying levels of cdna-derived  xxxg1592xxx  were grown in
dishes without methotrexate. the various cells were treated with
different concentrations of mmc and mendione ( xxxd3522xxx ). the
growth/survival of cells following 3 days of exposure to drugs was
measured by procedures as described (skehan et al, 1990; zilfou
et al, 1995). in addition, the cytotoxicity of drugs was also determined by colony formation assay as described previously (sakai
et al, 1995). briefly, the cho cells expressing different levels of
 xxxg1592xxx  were grown in monolayer, trypsinized and plated at a
density of 200 cells per 60-mm petri dish in medium containing
the various concentrations of mmc. after 24 h, the medium
containing mmc was replaced with fresh medium without mmc.
the hypoxic treatment of mmc was done for 1 h. the cells were
allowed to grow for 12–15 days into colonies. the colonies were
stained and counted. the drug concentration to produce 50%
reduction in colony formation was determined.

generation of  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice
we used gene targeting method to disrupt the  xxxg1592xxx  gene and
generated  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice that do not express  xxxg1592xxx  protein and
activity (radjendirane et al, 1998). the development of  xxxg1592xxx –/–
mice was normal. the  xxxg1592xxx +/+ and  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice were bred to
generate sufficient mice for mmc sensitivity assays. the levels
of  xxxd1875xxx -sensitive cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  activity in the various
tissues of wild-type ( xxxg1592xxx +/+) and  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice were
measured. the  xxxg1592xxx  activity (nmol of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol reduced min–1 mg–1 cytosolic protein) dropped from
515.3 ± 37.2 in colon of wild-type mice to zero levels in  xxxg1592xxx –/–
mice. the  xxxg1592xxx  activity also dropped significantly (> 85%;
 xxxg1592xxx +/+, 136.5 ± 10.2;  xxxg1592xxx –/–, 19.6 ± 4.1) in liver. the
residual amounts of  xxxg1592xxx  activity observed in livers of nqo1null mice is due to  xxxg1592xxx  related protein(s) rather than  xxxg1592xxx 
(radjendirane et al, 1998). this is because  xxxg1592xxx  protein was
absent in livers of  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice as determined by western
analysis (radjendirane et al, 1998).
metabolic activation of mmc in cytosolic fractions from
wild-type ( xxxg1592xxx +/+) and  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice as determined
by dna cross-linking
the cytosolic fractions from liver and colon tissues of wild-type
( xxxg1592xxx +/+) and  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice were prepared by standard
procedures. these cytosolic fractions were absolutely free of
microsomal contamination as no activity of microsomal-specific
enzyme nadph: cytochrome p450 reductase was detected in the
various cytosolic fractions (data not shown). the cytosolic fractions from wild-type ( xxxg1592xxx +/+) mice containing one unit of
 xxxg1592xxx  activity (equivalent to one µmol of 2,6-dichlorophenoindophenol reduced in 1 min) and similar amounts of cytosolic
proteins from  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice were incubated with 23 base pair of
double-stranded oligonucleotides containing mmc binding site
and dna cross-linking assays performed by procedure as
described (joseph et al, 1996). the nucleotide sequence of the
23 base pair oligonucleotide was 5′-ctacatcgtgtcatgcacaggat-3′. the complementary strands were mixed in equal
amounts and annealed by heating to 70°c and slowly cooling to
room temperature. the 3′-end of the top strand was selectively
labelled by klenow enzyme in the presence of [alpha-32p]dctp. the
labelled duplexes were purified on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and
used for incubation with the cytosolic extracts for cross-linking by
activated mmc. the incubation mixture included 100 mm phosphate buffer (ph 5.8), cytosolic protein, 1 mm nadh, 100 µm
mmc, 5 µm fad, 0.01% tween-20 and 0.18 mg bovine serum

at 95°c for 5 min in dna sequencing dye containing formamide.
the samples were analysed on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide

further characterization of the unique cytosolic activity
we used polyclonal antibodies against full-length  xxxg1592xxx  protein in
dna cross-linking assays to determine if the unique cytosolic

related to  xxxg1592xxx . the cytosolic extracts from human colon

treated with either pre-immune serum (10 µl) or with the various
concentrations of anti- xxxg1592xxx  serum for 1 h at 4°c and analysed for

between  xxxg1592xxx  levels in cho cells and ic50 of mmc as determined by colony formation assays (table 1). the 3682-fold
increase in  xxxg1592xxx  activity in cho cells resulted only in less than
twofold increase in sensitivity of these cells to mmc (table 1).
mmc-induced inter-strand dna cross-linking was observed
with cytosolic extracts from both wild-type ( xxxg1592xxx +/+) and
 xxxg1592xxx –/– mice tissues (figure 2 a and b). however, the amount
of dna cross-linking was slightly lower in case of  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice
tissues as compared to  xxxg1592xxx +/+ mice. this reduction in dna
cross-linking was no more than 15% of wild-type. the mmcinduced dna cross-linking in wild-type as well as  xxxg1592xxx –/–
tissues was inhibited by  xxxd1875xxx  (figure 2).
the results of antibody inhibition are shown in figures 3 and 4.

dna cross-linking in human colon carcinoma (ht29) cells and
wild-type ( xxxg1592xxx +/+) and knock out ( xxxg1592xxx –/–) mice. however,
the inhibition kinetics of  xxxg1592xxx  activity was significantly different
than that of mmc reductase-induced dna cross-linking. the
2.5 µl of  xxxg1592xxx  antibodies inhibited 5.5% of  xxxg1592xxx  activity in
ht29 cells, as compared to 43% inhibition of mmc-induced
dna cross-linking (figure 3). similarly, 10 µl of  xxxg1592xxx  antibodies inhibited 100% of mmc-induced dna cross-linking, as
compared to only 41% inhibition of the  xxxg1592xxx  activity in ht29
cells (figure 3). similar results were also observed with cytosolic
extracts from colon of  xxxg1592xxx +/+ mice (figure 4a). therefore, the
 xxxg1592xxx  antiserum inhibited mmc-induced dna cross-linking
more efficiently than  xxxg1592xxx  activity in both ht29 cells and
 xxxg1592xxx +/+ mice. the antibodies against  xxxg1592xxx  also inhibited
mmc induced dna cross-linking in  xxxg1592xxx  deficient ( xxxg1592xxx –/–)
mice colon (figure 4b).

bioreductive chemotherapy may be the most successful treatment
for certain types of cancer (sartorelli, 1988; ross et al, 1994;
workman, 1994; rauth et al, 1997). this is because it is based on
differences between normal and tumour tissues in enzyme levels,
oxygen content and ph. the enzymes which are expressed at
higher levels in tumours may activate the drugs for killing the
tumour cells. however, similar activation in normal cells may be at
lower levels which can be detoxified. therefore, effective dosage
of drugs could be administered with drastic damage to tumour
cells and less or no toxicity to normal cells. in addition, the
existence of hypoxic regions is a major problem in radiation
therapy, as oxygen is a radiation sensitizer. therefore, hypoxic
parts of the tumours often survive radiation treatment, and may be
centre for a recurrent tumour. bioreductive agents such as mmc
may be more active in these hypoxic regions of the tumours
(kennedy et al, 1980; stratford and stephens, 1989). the administration of such bioreductive agents as adjuvant to radiation may
be favourable for killing solid tumour cells. identification of
enzyme(s) that metabolically activate anti-tumour drugs like
mmc is one step forward in this direction.
in this report, we studied the role of  xxxg1592xxx  and other cytosolic
enzyme(s) in metabolic activation of mmc. the results revealed
that cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  plays an insignificant role in metabolic activation of mmc. the cho cells stably expressing higher levels of
cdna-derived  xxxg1592xxx  did not demonstrate increased cytotoxicity
upon exposure to mmc. this is in agreement with the earlier
report by gustafson et al (1996). in addition, the loss of  xxxg1592xxx  due
to disruption of  xxxg1592xxx  gene did not lead to a significant difference
in sensitivity of  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice to mmc, as compared with
wild-type ( xxxg1592xxx +/+) mice. both wild-type ( xxxg1592xxx +/+) and
 xxxg1592xxx –/– mice showed more or less similar response to mmc
exposure. furthermore, the cytosolic fractions from liver and
colon of  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice deficient in  xxxg1592xxx  protein/activity
catalysed high affinity reductive activation of mmc which led to
inter-strand dna cross-linking. the small amount of differences
between wild-type ( xxxg1592xxx +/+) and  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice may be due to
experimental variations or due to very low affinity of  xxxg1592xxx  for
mmc.
the results on mmc-induced dna cross-linking also revealed
that cytosolic fractions of wild-type ( xxxg1592xxx +/+) and  xxxg1592xxx –/–
mice contain an activity that catalysed metabolic activation of
mmc which led to dna cross-linking. this activity is designated

as cytosolic mmc reductase. the cytosolic mmc reductase
activity was inhibited by low concentrations of  xxxd1875xxx , an
inhibitor of  xxxg1592xxx . this indicated that cytosolic mmc reductase
activity may be related to  xxxg1592xxx . further experiments using polyclonal antibodies against full-length  xxxg1592xxx  protein confirmed this.
the  xxxg1592xxx  antibodies inhibited both  xxxg1592xxx  activity catalysed
reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and cytosolic mmc
reductase activity catalysed mmc-induced dna cross-linking.
however,  xxxg1592xxx  antibodies were more effective in inhibiting the
mmc-induced dna cross-linking, as compared to reduction of
2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. this may be due to lower concentration of mmc reductase activity as compared to the  xxxg1592xxx 
activity. it is for this reason that 10 µl of  xxxg1592xxx  antiserum
inhibited 100% of mmc-induced dna cross-linking, as
compared to 41% inhibition of  xxxg1592xxx  activity.
the mmc reductase activity is expected to be a new member of
nqo gene family. four gene loci encode for the various members
of the nqo gene family (jaiswal, 1988). two of these loci ( xxxg1592xxx 
and  xxxg1593xxx ) have been cloned and sequenced (jaiswal et al, 1988,
1990).  xxxg1593xxx  is a second member of the nqo gene family that
requires nrh instead of nad(p)h as a cofactor (wu et al, 1997).
mmc reductase activity may not be due to  xxxg1593xxx  because it
requires nad(p)h and not nrh as cofactor (joseph et al, 1996).
much of the literature suggests that cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  and  xxxg1593xxx 
protect cells against quinone-induced redox cycling and oxidative
stress (riley and workman, 1992; talalay et al, 1995). this is
supported by observations in the present report that cytosolic
 xxxg1592xxx  protected cho cells against  xxxd2563xxx  while remaining
more or less insensitive to mmc cytotoxicity. based on the
present results, we hypothesize that  xxxg1592xxx  may play no, or an
insignificant, role in the activation of mmc but may exclusively
protect cells against redox cycling and oxidative stress.  xxxg1592xxx –/–
mice represent a valuable tool to confirm this hypothesis using
other drugs such as  xxxd3416xxx  and  xxxd195xxx . we further hypothesize that
mmc reductase catalyses metabolic activation of mmc and other
drugs and xenobiotics containing quinone structures.
in summary, we used cellular and  xxxg1592xxx –/– mice models to
demonstrate that cytosolic  xxxg1592xxx  may not activate mmc. we
have characterized a unique cytosolic (mmc reductase) activity
that catalyses metabolic activation of mmc which led to dna
cross-linking. this activity is distinct from  xxxg1592xxx  but related to
 xxxg1592xxx . purification and cloning of mmc reductase activity
should reveal further information on this protein and its role in
bioreductive drugs activation.
