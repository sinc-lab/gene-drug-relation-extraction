the cdna encoding ph-20 hyaluronidase from human sperm has been mutated at five positions by

in vitro mutagenesis. we have changed three acidic amino acids and two arginine residues that are conserved in the sequence of mammalian ph-20 polypeptides as well as in the hyaluronidases from bee and
hornet venom. of the former, the mutants [gln113]ph-20 and [gln249]ph-20 had no detectable enzymatic activity; the mutant [asnllllph-20 had about 3% activity. the mutant [thr252]ph-20 was also
inactive, while [gly176]ph-20 had only about 1% activity. this indicates that the ph-20 hyaluronidases,
like numerous enzymes that hydrolyze glycosidic bonds, have acidic amino acids in their active site.
moreover, for the binding of the substrate, the polyanion hyaluronan, arginine residues appear to be
essential.

hyaluronan ( xxxd2289xxx ) is a ubiquitous component of
the extracellular matrix of vertebrates. this glycosaminoglycan,
which is composed of alternating units of n- xxxd2683xxx 
and glucuronic acid, can form highly viscous solutions and
thereby influence the properties of this matrix. hyaluronan has
been implicated in many biological processes including fertilization, embryonic development, cell migration, and differentiation,
wound healing, inflammation, and growth and metastasis of tumor cells (laurent and fraser, 1992). three types of hyaluronidases are known which are widely distributed in nature (see
meyer, 1971; kreil, 1995; frost et al., 1996 for reviews). one
group are endo-n-acetylhexosaminidasesthat hydrolyze hyaluronan with a molecular mass of over 1x lo6da mostly to tetrasaccharides. these enzymes have been detected in diverse
sources such as mammalian testes and insect venoms. a few
years ago, the amino acid sequence of  xxxd2216xxx  hyaluronidase
was elucidated via cdna cloning (gmachl and kreil, 1993).
the sequence of this enzyme was found to be homologous to
ph-20, a polypeptide localized on the head of guinea pig sperm
(lathrop et al., 1990). it could subsequently be demonstrated
that ph-20 from different mammalian species has hyaluronidase
activity (gmachl et al., 1993; lin et al., 1994a; cherr et al.,
1996).
a comparison of the amino acid sequences of bee and hornet
venom hyaluronidases (gmachl and kreil, 1993; lu et al., 1995)
and those of the human, monkey, mouse, and guinea pig ph-20
proteins (lathrop et al., 1990; gmachl et al., 1993; lin et al.,
1994a, b) demonstrated that in a common region encompassing
about 340 amino acids, 57 amino acids are conserved in all of
these proteins (fig. 1). these include four cysteine residues
forming two disulfide bridges. in addition, we assume that the
residues essential for substrate binding and catalysis are also
conserved between the hymenopteran and mammalian enzymes.

at present, nothing is known about the active site of hyaluronidases. based on a few assumptions, we have now addressed the question which amino acids in these enzymes are
essential for the hydrolysis of hyaluronan. binding of the acidic
glycosaminoglycan to the enzyme probably involves ionic interaction with basic amino acids. indeed, a comparison of the
mammalian ph-20 proteins and the enzymes from insect venom
demonstrates that three arginine residues are conserved in all
these polypeptides. as for the active site of hyaluronidases, we
assumed that it may be similar to that of other polysaccharide
hydrolases. it has been shown that in many enzymes of this type,
such as lysozymes, chitinases, xylanases and others a pair of
acidic residues, mostly glutamic acids, serves as the nucleophile
and the acidhase catalyst (see withers and aebersold, 1995 for
a recent review). three glutamic and three aspartic acids are
present at homologous positions in the insect and the mammalian hyaluronidases. following these conjectures, we have
changed several of these common amino acids in the human
ph-20 hyaluronidase by in vitro mutagenesis.

experimental procedures
in vitro mutagenesis. the clone pcml9/24 (gmachl et al.,
1993) containing the human ph-20 cdna in the bluescript vector (stratagene) was amplified twice by pcr with suitable oligonucleotides as primers (higuchi et al., 1988). for the first rounds
of pcr, these were gccagtatacaatttgggaatggc
(s'-outside primer), which hybridizes to the 5'-end of the acci
fragment of the ph-20 cdna and which contains a restriction site for this enzyme (underlined), and a 3'-mismatch primer
with the desired mutation. in a parallel pcr, the same mutation
was present in a 5'-mismatch primer; the oligonucleotide
cgccaaatgtatacacaagttc, which hybridizes to the 3'end of the acci fragment, was used as the second primer (3'outside primer). pcr was performed with 2 pg dna, 25 pmol
of each primer, 0.2 mm dntps, 0.5 u tth dna polymerase
(promega), 0.05 u deep vent dna polymerase, and 0.1 vol.
deep vent dna polymerase buffer (biolabs) in a final volume
of 50 pl. after denaturating the dna for 2 min at 92"c, 10

fig. 1. amino acid sequence of human ph-20 hyaluronidase. amino acids conserved between mammalian and insect venom hyaluronidases are
marked (w), the four conserved cysteine residues are marked (i). the five mutated amino acids are indicated by (i).
the deletions are marked (i).

cycles of pcr were performed (30 s at 92"c, 30 s at 48"c, 15 s
at 72°c) followed by 3 rnin of polymerization at 72°c. amplified fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and
eluted with the qiaex i1 agarose gel extraction kit (qiagen).
the fragments obtained in the two pcrs were combined and
amplified under the same conditions except that only the outside
primers were used. the products were again purified by agarose
gel electrophoresis and digested with the restriction endonuclease acci. this yielded a central fragment, nucleotides 7841341, of the mutated ph-20 cdnas, which was then inserted
into the acci site of the plasmid pata-hph (see below).

preparation of ph-20 mutants with c-terminal deletions.
the mutant des-(439 -474)-ph-20 was generated by digestion
of the human ph-20 cdna with the endonuclease styi. the
truncated cdna was blunt ended with t4 dna polymerase and
ligated into the smai site of pgpt-ata-18. the mutant des-(341474)-ph-20 was created by the introduction of a stop codon at
the position of the cys341 (tgt-tga) using the same method
as for the other mutants.

ligation of pcr fragments into the vaccinia virus expression vector pgpt-ata-18. the human ph-20 cdna had
earlier been inserted into the pgpt-ata-18 vector (stunnenberg
et al., 1988) to yield p-ata-hph (gmachl et al., 1993). to remove the acci restriction site in the polylinker of the vector,
p-ata-hph was digested with bamhi and pstl. after incubation
with t4 dna polymerase (10 rnin at 16"c, 5 rnin at 37"c,
20 min at 65"c), the blunt-ended vector was ligated with t4
dna ligase. the modified p-ata-hph plasmid and the pcr
products were digested with acci and ligated for 2 h at room
temperature. inserts of positive clones were checked by sequencing the region corresponding to the accl fragments.
preparation of recombinant vaccinia virus. recombinant
virus expressing the different ph-20 mutants were prepared as
described previously (gmachl et al., 1993; stunnenberg et al.,
1988). hela cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus
at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 or 1. after different times,
cells were lysed by freezing and thawing, and tested for expression of wild-type and mutant ph-20 polypeptides.
western blots. cells were lysed by freezing and thawing
and crude membrane fractions were isolated by centrifugation at
900 g for 10 min. membranes were solubilized in nacl/p,
(137 mm naci, 2.7 mm kcl, 7.5 mm na,hpo,, 1.4 mm

kh,po,, ph 7.5) containing 1% triton x-100 and used for
western blot analysis. prior to digestion with glycosidase f
(boehringer), samples were denatured in nacl/p,/o. 1% sodium
dodecylsulfate/25 mm edta for 5 rnin at 95°c. digestion was
performed with 0.4 u enzyme at 37 "c for 90 min. the recombinant human ph-20 polypeptides were detected with a polyclonal
antiserum against ph-20 from cynomolgus macaques (kindly
provided by dr paul primakoff) and a second antibody labelled
with peroxidase (bio-rad). the antiserum was diluted 1000fold.
hyaluronidase assays. hela cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus were centrifuged at 900 g for 10 min, washed
with nacup,, and lysed by freezing and thawing. crude membranes were pelleted, washed with naci/p, and ph-20 polypeptides were solubilized by addition of 1 % triton x-100 (1 ml
triton for about 2x10' cells harvested from one large petri
dish). supernatants were stored at -20°c. aliquots of 20 p1
were used for different hyaluronidase assays (dorfman, 1955 ;
guntenhoner et al., 1992; lee and cowman, 1994).
hyaluronan from human umbilical cord was dissolved at a
concentration of 0.25 mg/ml in 0.02 m sodiumphosphate,
ph 6.9, containing 75 mm nacl and 0.01 % bovine  xxxg124xxx . aliquots of the triton extracts were added to 20 pl hyaluronan and incubated for 2 h at 37°c. samples were then boiled
and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis (0.5 % agarose).
hyaluronan and its fragments were detected by staining the gel
with the cationic dye stains-all (3,3'-dimethyl-9-methyl4,5,4',5'-dibenzothiacarbocyanine) as described by lee and
cowman (1994). membranes prepared from rabbit kidney rk13
cells expressing the dg42 polypeptide were incubated in the
presence of  xxxd1482xxx  and ['4c] xxxd534xxx  as described (meyer and kreil, 1996). at the end of the reaction, the
solution was centrifuged and from the supernatant, low-molecular-mass components were removed by filtration through a
30 kda filter (centricon 30, amicon).
hyaluronidase activity was determined as described above
except that about 30 ng ['"c]hyaluronan (3000 cpm) were included in the reaction. at different times, aliquots were removed, boiled for 5 rnin and fractionated by paper chromatography (whatman 3mm paper) using 7:13 (by vol.) 1 m ammonium acetate (ph 5.5)/ethanol as solvent. radioactivity remaining at the origin was detected with a liquid scintillation counter.

79.3-84.0% in mutant [gly176]ph-20 (lane 6, five experiments,
average 82.1); 51.2-59.2% for mutant [asnllliph-20 (lane 9, five experiments, average 54.2).

ing with the expected amino end (von heijne, 1986) is shown
in fig. 1. amino acids conserved between insect venom hyaluronidases and the mammalian ph-20 proteins are marked. of
these invariant residues, we have selected two glutamic, one
 xxxd233xxx , and two arginines. these were changed to neutral
amino acids by in vitro mutagenesis of the acci fragment of the
cloned cdna encoding the human ph-20 protein (see experimental procedures section). the mutations were checked by sequencing. subsequently, the acci fragment was excised from the
pata-hph vector encoding the human ph-20 cdna and replaced by acci fragments containg the desired mutations. recombinant vaccinia virus was prepared and used to infect hela
cells. expression of the wild-type and mutated ph-20 proteins
was checked by western blotting. as shown in fig. 2, comparable amounts of ph-20 protein could be detected in all cases.
only for the mutant [gln249]ph-20 was expression somewhat
lower. two bands with an apparent molecular mass around

65 kda were observed, which probably represent polypeptides
with different glycosylation patterns. indeed, the relative amount

of the larger, presumably more highly glycosylated form, increases with time after infection by the recombinant vaccinia
virus (fig. 3). treatment with endoglycosidase f yields a single
polypeptide. this pattern is similar to that observed with ph-20
from macaque sperm (cherr et al., 1996).
cells infected with the different recombinant vaccinia virus
at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 were collected after 48 h,
lysed, and crude membrane fractions were tested for hyaluronidase activity. with the five mutants, enzymatic activities were
too low to obtain reliable values with the assay developed by
dorfmann (1955). for a first estimate, we therefore used a gel
assay with decreasing amounts of wild-type ph-20 hyaluronidase as a standard (fig. 4a). this indicated that three of the

and 1/2 (-0-) the amount of extract from cells expressing wild-type
ph-20. conditions are as described in the legend of fig. 5.

mutants, [glnl13]ph-20, [gln249]ph-20, and [thr252]ph-20
were devoid of enzymatic activity, while the two other mutants,
[asnlll]ph-20 and [gly176]ph-20, had residual activities in
the range of one to a few percent of wild-type ph-20 hyaluronidase.
this was tested in more detail with a radioactive assay as
used for measuring the biosynthesis of hyaluronan (meyer and
kreil, 1996). upon paper chromatography in a suitable solvent
system, high-molecular mass polysaccharides stay at the origin,
while udp-sugars and oligosaccharides migrate away. radioactive hyaluronan was incubated with equal-volume aliquots from
lysates prepared from cells infected with recombinant vaccinia
virus encoding the different mutants. as controls, a series of
dilutions from lysates obtained from cells expressing the wildtype ph-20 hyaluronidase were included. as shown in fig. 4b,
the mutants [gly176]ph-20 and [asnlll]ph-20 had about 1%
and 3 % of the wild-type enzyme activity, respectively. this was
corroborated by a time-course experiment (fig. 5). for the other
three mutants, enzymatic activity could not be detected with this
assay using a radioactive substrate.

we also wanted to test whether ph-20 polypeptides with
deletions at the c-terminus had any enzymatic activity. one such
mutant that lacked the last 36 amino acids had about 25 % of the
hyaluronidase activity exhibited by the intact molecule (fig. 6).
the ph-20 protein is anchored to the head of spermatozoa via
a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. the des-(439-474)ph-20 mutant should lack this anchor and would thus be expected to be a secreted polypeptide. interestingly, it was found
that upon expression of this mutant in hela cells, the protein
was not secreted but retained inside the cells (data not shown).
a larger deletion at the c-terminus that lacked 134 amino
acids was also devoid of enzymatic activity. as checked by
western blotting, the mutant protein was not secreted from infected cells (data not shown).

discussion
since the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of
lysozyme 30 years ago (philips, 1967), many of the enzymes
that degrade different polysaccharides have been studied in detail (see recent reviews by henrissat and bairoch, 1993 ; withers
and aebersold, 1995). apparently without exception, the carboxyl groups of two acidic amino acids function as acidbase
catalysts in the hydrolytic reaction. moreover, in some instances
a third residue of this type is also important as it apparently
modulates the ionization of one of the other carboxyl groups
(klein et al., 1992; qian et al., 1994). in this study, we present
evidence that suggests that this is also true for the human
ph-20 hyaluronidase. in vitro mutagenesis of the glu113 or
glu249 to glutamine yielded ph-20 polypeptides without detectable enzymatic activity in two different assay systems. a third
mutant, where asp111 was changed to asparagine, had about
3% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme. these three acidic
amino acids lie within clusters of amino acids that are conserved
between mammalian and hymenopteran hyaluronidases. there
are three more conserved residues of this type, asp59, asp275,
and glu158, but these are located outside the constant sequence
segments and were thus considered to be less likely candidates
for being part of the active site.
in view of the fact that the substrate of hyaluronidases is a
polyanion, it seemed likely that its binding to the enzyme involves ionic interaction with positively charged amino acids. of
the conserved residues of this group, three arginines and one
histidine, we have mutated two arginines. of these, the
[thr252]ph-20 mutation yielded an enzyme without detectable
activity. this residue is close to glu249, which appears to be
part of the active site. the second mutant, [gly176]ph-20, has
residual enzymatic activity about 1% of the wild-type enzyme,
indicating that this amino acid is also important for substrate
binding. it has been shown that the testicular hyaluronidase interacts with a hexasaccharide as the smallest substrate (takagaki
et al., 1994). it thus seems likely that at least one more positively
charged amino acid interacts with a carboxyl group of a glucuronic acid of the substrate. finally, we have generated two truncated versions of the human ph-20 hyaluronidase. in one version, we only removed 36 amino acids from the carboxyl end.
this should yield a secreted polypeptide without the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of the native form. this rather small
deletion yields a protein with about one quarter of the enzymatic
activity of wild-type ph-20. however, the mutated polypeptide
is not secreted from hela cells but remains inside the cells. a
similar deletion in the ph-20 protein from cynomolgus monkey
was constructed by lin et al. (1994a). this truncated protein
was secreted by insect cells and could be purified with an antibody column from media. apparently, this mutant retains full

814

arming et al. (eur: j. biochem. 247)

activity. a second, larger deletion in the human protein was generated to obtain a derivative of the testis enzyme closely resembling the  xxxd2216xxx  enzyme. the des-(341-474)-ph-20 mutant
terminates in the same region as the latter; in addition, only the
four cysteine residues common to all these hyaluronidases are
present in this fragment. however, contrary to our expectations
we could not detect enzymatic activity in cells expressing the
des-(342 -474)-ph-20 mutant.
in this study, we present data on amino acids that are apparently essential for binding or hydrolysis in a mammalian hyaluronidase. it has previously been shown that guinea pigs immunized with their own ph-20 protein are sterile but regain fertility
when the antibody titer decreases (primakoff et al., 1988).
should such a method ever be applied in human contraception,
it would clearly be advantageous to use a polypeptide for immunization that is devoid of enzymatic activity. within the limits
of the hyaluronidase assays used in this study, three such mutants are now available.
we want to thank dr paul primakoff (university of connecticut) for
a gift of ph-20 antiserum. dr michael gmachl prepared the cdna encoding the des-(439 -474)-ph-20 fragment of the human ph-20 protein.
