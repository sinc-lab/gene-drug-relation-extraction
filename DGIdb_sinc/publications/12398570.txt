carvedilol overdose

objective: to report a case of nightmares and sleep disorder associated with improper use of carvedilol, an alpha/beta-blocker, and to
model the time course of receptor occupancy in this patient.
case summary: a 41-year-old man with panic disorder had been treated with alprazolam 1.2 mg/d (3 times daily), carvedilol 10
mg/d (once in the morning), and etizolam 0.5 mg (for anxiety attack). although the physical and psychological symptoms gradually
improved, he reported nightmares and panic attacks. an interview revealed that he had been taking carvedilol 5 mg twice a day after
lunch and dinner on his own initiative, in addition to the prescribed dosage. the patient was asked to take carvedilol 10 mg only after
breakfast, as had been advised. consequently, the sleep disorder and nightmares disappeared.
methods: we calculated the time courses of  xxxg92xxx  binding occupancy in the central nervous system after oral
administration of carvedilol with the ordinary and improper regimens by using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters
obtained from the literature.
results: compared with the ordinary dose of carvedilol 10 mg once a day, the improper regimen (10 mg after breakfast followed by
5 mg after lunch and dinner) increases the  xxxg92xxx  binding occupancy at night (2300) to as high as the mean beta2adrenoceptor binding occupancy after an ordinary dose of propranolol.
conclusions: the sleep disorder and nightmares experienced by this patient had been induced by elevation of central beta2adrenoceptor binding occupancy at night as the result of improper use of carvedilol.
key words: carvedilol, nightmares.

beta

-adrenoceptor blocking agents have been widely used
in the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, cardiac dysrhythmia, and essential tremor. however, beta-blockers have been reported1-6 to induce sleep disorder, with
symptoms such as nightmares and insomnia. these adverse reactions are clinically important because they reduce the quality of life of patients during chronic treatment
with beta-blockers, although the rate of incidence of these adverse reactions is low.7 shaw and england8 first reported a
case of nightmares associated with the use of  xxxd2957xxx .
subsequently, propranolol, a highly lipophilic beta-blocker,9
and atenolol, a less lipophilic agent,10 have been reported
to induce adverse reactions, such as nightmares, of the central nervous system (cns). nightmares are now regarded
as an important adverse effect because lipophilic beta-blockers achieve an extensive distribution to the cns. the adverse effects of beta-blockers tend to occur within a few
weeks after the start of treatment with an incremental increase of dose and disappear when the dose is decreased or

the drug is withdrawn.1-6,11 although the mechanism of the
cns adverse effects of beta-blockers has not been fully clarified, it is likely to involve blockade of the beta2-adrenoceptors
in the cns.11
however, no cns adverse reaction such as sleep disorder
or nightmares has been previously reported for carvedilol,
an alpha/beta-blocker. we report a case of nightmares associated
with carvedilol in a 41-year-old patient with panic disorder. we show that the extent of beta-blocker–induced cns
adverse reactions can be quantitatively predicted based on
the  xxxg92xxx  occupancy in the cns.11 therefore, we
calculated the central  xxxg92xxx  occupancy in this
patient using our model with literature values of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters and compared the
results with literature values of occupancy for other betablockers.

case reports

several months later, while driving, he first experienced a panic attack,
with palpitations and excessive sweating. thereafter, he became unable
to walk in town due to anxiety that he might be injured by traffic. since
1992, he has been treated at several clinics near his house.
in 1995, he was diagnosed as having panic disorder, and etizolam 0.5
mg/d (once before sleep),  xxxd2689xxx  30 mg/d (once in the morning), cloxazolam 2 mg/d (once in the morning), and amitriptyline 10 mg/d (once in
the morning) were started. he was also prescribed  xxxd461xxx  sodium
0.3 mg/d once in the evening and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.1 mg/d
once in the morning for hypercholesterolemia and prostatomegaly, respectively.
in the summer of 1996, when walking in town, the patient felt uneasy
and was admitted to the hospital for about 1 week. various examinations,
including intracardiac catheterization, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head, and sleep electroencephalogram,
revealed no abnormalities. his medication was not altered after discharge. although the anxiety did not disappear, he experienced no panic
attacks.
in january 2000, the patient was referred to kyushu university hospital with chief complaints of palpitations and irritation. at that time, he
did not smoke or drink alcohol. he weighed 70 kg and was 170 cm in
height. results of the physical examination were normal with the exception of elevated blood pressure (140/92 mm hg). blood laboratory test
data were essentially normal, with slightly increased blood glucose (129
mg/dl; normal range 69–104) and triglycerides (188 mg/dl; normal
range 30–150). urinary and electrocardiographic examinations revealed
no abnormalities.
panic disorder and essential hypertension were diagnosed, and alprazolam 1.2 mg/d (3 times daily), carvedilol 10 mg/d (once in the morning), and etizolam 0.5 mg (for anxiety attacks) were prescribed.  xxxd461xxx  sodium 0.3 mg/d (once in the evening) and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.1 mg/d (once in the morning) were continued. thereafter, the
man’s physical and psychiatric symptoms, such as facial flushing and irritation, gradually improved. his medications were not changed, and the
sleep disorder and panic attacks remained well controlled through december 2000.
in january 2001, the patient complained of a sleep disorder and nightmares that had been occurring for several days, as well as experiencing a
panic attack while driving on the highway. a detailed interview by a
physician and a pharmacist revealed that the patient had been taking
carvedilol 5 mg after lunch and dinner for 1 week on his own initiative,
in addition to the ordinary dosage of 10 mg after breakfast, because he
expected that carvedilol might decrease his blood pressure. the physician advised him to take only the prescribed dose of carvedilol and prescribed lorazepam 0.5 mg for anxiety attacks. it was confirmed that the
patient took carvedilol according to instructions after the consultation.
his sleep disorder improved thereafter and he did not need to use lorazepam. in 2001, fluvoxamine 100 mg/d was added for the treatment of
panic disorder and depressive state. after the start of fluvoxamine, the
patient’s hypochondriasis disappeared, and his compliance and the
physician–patient relationship have improved. fluvoxamine did not
worsen the sleep disorder or nightmares.
carvedilol 10 mg/d (once in the morning) has been continued, and the
man has been free from sleep disorder up to the present. the naranjo
probability scale12 indicated that carvedilol was the probable cause of
this patient’s sleep disorder.

pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis
beta-blocker parameters

the following primary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of 5 beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol,
 xxxd2957xxx , propranolol, carvedilol) after ordinary dosage
regimens were obtained from the literature: mean plasma
concentration at steady-state (css),13,14 plasma unbound fraction (fu),13,15 and the cerebrospinal fluid (csf):plasma unbound concentration ratio at steady-state (kpf) for atenolol,
metoprolol,  xxxd2957xxx , propranolol16,17 or the brain: plasma
unbound drug concentration ratio for carvedilol.18 the in
www.theannals.com

vitro dissociation constant (kb) of each beta-blocker for the
 xxxg92xxx  was also taken from the literature.13,19
quantitative prediction of the cns adverse
effects

the extent of adverse effects in the cns was predicted
by applying the model previously reported,11 based on
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. receptor occupancy (phi) can be expressed in terms of the unbound drug concentration around the receptor (cr) and kb
by the following equation:
phi (%) = cr / (kb + cr) • 100
eq. 1
we assumed that the cns adverse effects of the beta-blockers are caused by blockade of the  xxxg92xxx . further,
we assumed that cr is equivalent to the unbound drug concentration in csf (ccsf) because the drug in csf is distributed to the extracellular fluid in the brain. therefore, cr
can be expressed as follows:
eq. 2
cr = ccsf = cf • kpf = fu • cp • kpf
where cf and cp represent the unbound drug concentration in plasma and the plasma concentration, respectively.
therefore, the  xxxg92xxx  occupancy in the cns at
steady-state (phic,ss) after oral administration of a therapeutic
dose of each beta-blocker is expressed by the following equations:
eq. 3
phic,ss (%) = ccsf,ss / (kb + ccsf,ss) • 100
eq. 4
ccsf,ss = fu • css • kpf
where ccsf,ss represents the unbound drug concentration in
csf at steady-state. the phic,ss value for carvedilol was calculated by the use of equations 3 and 4, with the assumption that the kpf for carvedilol is 1, and compared with
those of the other 4 beta-blockers. we have previously reported11 that phic,ss correlates with the extent of cns adverse effects assessed in terms of a sleep disorder score. this relationship is expressed by the following equations:
eq. 5
na = 0.568 phic,ss + 68.8
eq. 6
nb = 0.272 phic,ss + 35.2
where na and nb represent the number of recalled
dreams and remembered awakenings, respectively, in 10
healthy subjects who took a therapeutic dose of a beta-blocker (atenolol,  xxxd2957xxx , metoprolol, propranolol, or placebo)
for 6 nights.1-3 we applied the above relationships to the
present case of carvedilol overdose to estimate the score of
the cns adverse effects (na and nb) of carvedilol and
compared the result with those for the other 4 beta-blockers.
time-course of  xxxg92xxx  occupancy and
extent of carvedilol cns adverse effects

pharmacokinetic parameters of carvedilol after single
oral administration were obtained from the literature.14 we
calculated the time course of phic (beta-adrenoceptor occupancy in the cns) after oral administration of carvedilol with
the improper dosage regimen taken by our patient (i.e., 10

mg in the morning, 5 mg in the afternoon and night) and
compared it with that after an ordinary dosage regimen (10
mg once in the morning) by using the following equation:
eq. 7
phic (%) = ccsf / (kb + ccsf) • 100
furthermore, we predicted and compared the relative intensity of cns adverse effects at night (2300) by introducing the above phic values into equations 5 and 6.

the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters
and the ccsf calculated from these data for each beta-blocker
are listed in table 1. the kb value of each beta-blocker obtained from the literature, the estimated phic,ss value, and the
na previously reported are listed in table 2.
figure 14 shows the time courses of plasma concentration (a) and the estimated phic value (b) of carvedilol after
oral administration of carvedilol 10 mg once only at 800
according to the prescription, and those after the additional
improper ingestion of 5 mg at 1400 and 2200.
figure 2 presents the relationships between the intensities of the cns adverse effects for atenolol,  xxxd2957xxx ,
metoprolol, and propranolol, and the phic values of the 4 betablockers, along with the predicted intensities of carvedilolinduced cns adverse reactions based on the central beta2adrenoceptor occupancies estimated from ccsf,ss; ccsf at 2300
after administration of carvedilol 10 mg at 800 as prescribed; and ccsf at 2300 after administration of carvedilol
10 mg, 5 mg, and 5 mg at 800, 1400, and 2200, respectively.

sive diffusion. therefore, we assumed the kpf value of
carvedilol to be 1. the estimated phic,ss value of carvedilol
was 25%, considerably higher than that of atenolol, which
has been reported10 to induce nightmares (table 2).
analysis of the time courses of phic revealed that the predicted phic value of carvedilol at 2300 was elevated from
<5% to 50%, which is comparable to the phic,ss value of propranolol, by the improper additional use of carvedilol (two
5-mg doses). in our patient, nightmares occurred only during the period when he took the 2 additional doses of
carvedilol 5 mg and disappeared soon after cessation of the
improper dosing regimen.
the predicted phic value was 10–70% at night after the 2
additional doses were taken and <10% when carvedilol 10
mg was taken once in the morning. based on these findings, to prevent beta-blocker–induced nightmares, it may be
rational to keep the predicted phic value <10% at night.
discussion
this patient was also prescribed alprazolam 1.2 mg/d
it is conceivable that carvedilol may be extensively disand etizolam 0.5 mg. it has been reported23-25 that benzoditributed into the cns because its n-octanol/water partition

fects of medications. furthermore, as in the present case, a
panic attack may be induced by sleep disorder or nightmares in patients with panic disorder,27 although panic disorder itself did not seem to evoke nightmares in this patient. a number of cases of nightmares have been reported
in patients taking beta-blockers such as pindolol8 and propranolol.10 moreover, sleep disorders have been reported in
patients taking alpha/beta-blockers, such as  xxxd2435xxx .28 therefore,

beta-blockers need to be carefully chosen and the dosage regimen should be carefully determined, especially in patients
with panic disorder or hypochondria.

résumé

les auteurs signalent un cas de cauchemar et de désordre du
sommeil associé à l’utilisation inappropriée du carvédilol, un alpha/beta
bloquant. ils proposent aussi un modèle d’occupation des récepteurs
chez ce patient.
présentation sommaire du cas: un homme âgé de 41 ans souffrant de
trouble panique a été traité avec 1.2 mg par jour d’alprazolam tid, 10 mg
par jour de carvédilol (une fois le matin), et 0.5 mg d’étizolam (pour les
attaques de panique). bien que ses symptômes physiques et
psychologiques se soient améliorés graduellement, il s’est plaint de
cauchemars et d’attaque de panique. une entrevue a révélé qu’il prenait
5 mg de carvédilol après le dîner et le souper en plus de la dose prescrite
de 10 mg une fois le matin. on lui a recommandé de prendre seulement
la dose de 10 mg de carvédilol après le déjeuner, tel que prescrit. son
trouble de sommeil et les cauchemars ont disparu.
intervention: les auteurs ont calculé le pourcentage d’occupation des
récepteurs beta2-adrénergiques au niveau du système nerveux central après
l’administration par voie orale de carvédilol à la posologie habituelle et
inappropriée en utilisant des paramètres pharmacocinétiques et
pharmacodynamiques obtenus à partir de la documentation scientifique.
résultats: comparé à la dose habituelle de carvédilol, 10 mg une fois
par jour le matin, la dose inappropriée (5 mg après le dîner et le souper
en plus de la dose de 10 mg du matin) augmente le taux d’occupation
des récepteurs beta2-adrénergiques la nuit (2300) à un niveau aussi élevé
que le taux moyen observé après une dose habituelle de propranolol.
conclusions: les auteurs concluent que le désordre du sommeil et les
cauchemars ont été causés chez ce patient par l’augmentation de la
liaison beta2-adrénergique centrale la nuit due à l’utilisation inappropriée
du carvédilol.
