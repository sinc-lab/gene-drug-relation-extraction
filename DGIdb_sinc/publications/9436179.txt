review of pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic properties of  xxxd3261xxx .  due to various side effects of heparin, such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type i or type ii, alternative anticoagulants are in clinical development to optimize the anticoagulant regimes in patients requiring low or high anticoagulation dosages.  xxxd3261xxx  is a highly purified preparation containing a fast-moving heparin fraction as well as dermatansulfate. the pharmacological effects of  xxxd3261xxx  differ substantially from unfractionated heparin and are mainly characterized by a prolonged half-life and reduced effect on global coagulation and bleeding parameters. the lipolytic activity of  xxxd3261xxx  is increased in comparison to unfractionated heparin. clinical studies demonstrate the safety and efficacy of  xxxd3261xxx . specially, oral administration leads to fibrinolytic activities in contrast to oral administration of other glycosaminoglycans. thus,  xxxd3261xxx  releases tissue plasminogen activator and decreases fibrinogen levels as well as hdl and total cholesterol levels and blood viscosity. clinical efficacy is demonstrated in peripheral arterial disease, cardiovascular events, in postphlebitic syndrome and on albuminuria in nephropathy.
