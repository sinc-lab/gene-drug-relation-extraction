summary
synopsis

 xxxd1924xxx  ( xxxd1924xxx  mesilate) is a pseudopelletierine-derived 5-ht3 antagonist which has recently become available for clinical use. it is rapidly converted
in vivo to its active majo r metabolite, hydrodolasetron. which appears to be
largely responsible for its pharmacological activity.
in clinical trials, single intravenous or oral doses ofdolasetron were effective
in preventing acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv). intravenous doses of 1.8 mg/kg achieved complete suppression ofvomiting in approximately 50 % of patients receiving highly emetogenic cisplatin-containing
chemotherapy and in approximately 60 to 80% ofpatients receiving moderately
emetogenic chemotherapy. in the latter setting, oral doses of 200mg achieved
similar response rates. in comparative studies, intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  1.8 mg/kg
was as effective as intravenous granisetron 3mg orondansetron 32mg after highly
emetogenic chemotherapy, and oral dolas etron 200mg was equivalent to multiple
oral doses of ondansetron (3 or 4 dose s of 8mg) after moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy.  xxxd1924xxx  1.8 mg/kg was superior to metoclopramide in preventing emesis induced by high dose cisplatin or by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy in high risk subgroups.  xxxd1924xxx  has also shown efficacy in preventing
radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (rinv) in preliminary studies.
single intravenous or oral  xxxd1924xxx  doses ranging from 12.5 to ioomg and
25 to 200mg, respectively, were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting (ponv) in female surgical patients.
a 50mg intravenous dose was as effective in preventing ponvas ondansetron
4mg in a mixed-gender group. intravenously administered  xxxd1924xxx  was also
effective in treating established ponv, although complete suppression of vomiting was achieved in <40% ofpatients.
 xxxd1924xxx  has a tolerability profile characteristic ofthis class ofcompounds,
with headache, dizziness and diarrhoea being the most commonly occurring adverse events in clinical trials . diarrhoea is not thought to be related to  xxxd1924xxx 
administration, being experienced mostly by patients receiving chemotherapy.
 xxxd1924xxx  and other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists have been associated with minor changes in ecg intervals, but these generally do not appear to be clinically
important.
thus, available evidence sugge sts that  xxxd1924xxx  will provide an alternative
to other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists for the management of cinv and ponv.
further studies are required to determine whether it offers any advantages over
other agents in these settings and to determine the optimum dosage for preventing
rinv.

 xxxd1924xxx : a review

275

pharma cology

 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists are believed to induce their antiemetic effects by
blocking 5-ht3 receptors in the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone and in the
ga strointestinal tract. dol asetron and its metabolites bind se lectively to 5-ht3
receptor s; the major metabolite, hydrodola  xxxd274xxx , which appears to account
for mo st of the pharmacological act ivity of dol asetron, has the greatest affinity
(,=50-fold greater than the parent compound). when administered intravenously,
 xxxd1924xxx  blocked the serotonin-induced von bezold-jarisch reflex (transient
bradycardia) in the anaesthetised rat (edso '=3 ug/kg), suppression of cisplatininduced vomiting has been demonstrated in ferret s given dol asetron 0.5 to 2
mg/kg and dog s given 0.1 to 3 mg/kg intravenously.
it has been suggested that 5-ht3 antagonists may have anxiolytic and/or antipsychotic effects.  xxxd1924xxx  facilitated latent inhibition in rats (a model of
selective attention) and when given for 21 days it reduced the number of spontaneously active dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain of rats .
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists also appear to have electrophysiological effects.
at a concentration of 3 to 10 umol/l in vitro,  xxxd1924xxx  and its major metabolite
decreased the maximum depolarisation rate during the early phase of the action
potential in guinea-pig pap illary muscle fibre s without significantly affecting the
duration of action potential.  xxxd1924xxx  also produces minor changes in ecg
interval s (prolongation of the pr interval , qt c and qrs duration and slightly
increased heart rate ) in both patients and healthy volunteers.

pharmacokinetics

after intravenous or oral administration,  xxxd1924xxx  is rapidly converted in vivo
to its active maj or metabolite, hydrodolasetron. peak plasma concentrations
(cmaj of hydrodola  xxxd274xxx  occurred approximately 0.5 to 0.6 hours after intravenous administration and i hour after oral administration.
area under the concentration-time curve (avc) and c max for hydrodola  xxxd274xxx 
were dose-proportional in healthy young volunteers. however, elimination of
 xxxd1924xxx  and its major metabolite wa s independent of the dose adm inistered.
peak plasma hydrodolasetron concentrations were 125 ug/l after intravenous
adm ini strati on of 0.6 mg/kg and 525 ug/l after an oral do se of  xxxd1924xxx  200mg.
the mean vo lume of distribution was 4.15 to 5.5 llkg .
oral bio avai lability of the tablet formulation ranges from approximately 70 %
in healthy young men to 89% in healthy elderly volunteers and is not affected by
food intake.
hydrodolasetron undergoes further metabolism by cyp450 enzymes before
being excreted as glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates. 59 % of an orally administered dose was excreted in the urine (virtually all as metabolites) and 25% in
the faece s. the mean plasma elimination half-life of hydrodolasetron in healthy
young volunteers varied considerably, ranging from approximately 4 to 8 hours
after intravenous administration; and 5 to 10 hour s after oral administration .
in patients with mildly to severely impaired renal function , renal clearance
was decreased and avc was increased (~2- fo l d ) , but these changes are not sufficient to necessitate adjustment of  xxxd1924xxx  dosage. the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd1924xxx  do not appear to be affected substantially by age or gender.

therapeutic potential

chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv). in clinical trials, single
intravenou s or oral doses of  xxxd1924xxx  were effecti ve in preventing acute ciny.
the optimum intravenous dose was 1.8 mg/kg. in general, thi s achieved complete
response (complete suppression of vomiting without use of rescue medication)
in approximatel y 50 % of patients who received highly emetogenic (cisplatin)

chemotherapy and 60 to 80% of those receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. similar results were obtained with an oral dose of 200mg in the latter
setting . as observed with other agents of this class, male gender, a history of
alcoholism and no previous chemotherapy were significant predictors of good
response. the efficacy of  xxxd1924xxx  was enhanced by concomitant administrat ion
of dexamethasone, with an all-oral regimen of  xxxd1924xxx  200mg and dexamethasone 20mg achieving a complete response rate of 76% after highly emetogenic
chemotherapy.
in comparative studies, intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  1.8 mg/kg was as effective as
intravenous granisetron 3mg or ondansetron 32mg in preventing cinv after
highly emetogenic chemotherapy, and oral  xxxd1924xxx  200mg was equivalent to
multiple oral doses of ondansetron (3 or 4 doses of 8mg) after moderately
emetogenic chemotherapy. intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  1.2 or 1.8 mg/kg was significantly superior to high dose intravenous metoclopramide (7 mg/kg divided regimen) in preventing emesis induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy:
complete response rates were 48% and 57% versus 35%. in patients receiving
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy,  xxxd1924xxx  was similar to metoclopramide
(5 mg/kg) overall , but superior to metoclopramide in high risk subgroups , particularly in female patients who had received previous chemotherapy.
radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (rinv).  xxxd1924xxx  has also
shown efficacy in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by fractionated or
unfractionated radiotherapy or total body irradiation in preliminary dose-ranging
studies . a complete response rate of 100% was obtained with  xxxd1924xxx  40mg
intravenously and a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg was superior to placebo (complete response in 91 vs 54% of patients).
postoperative nausea and vomiting (ponv). intravenous or oral  xxxd1924xxx 
doses ranging from 12.5 to ioomg and 25 to 200mg, respectively, were superior
to placebo in preventing pony in female patients undergoing gynaecological
surgery (complete response rates ",50 to 70% vs ",30%). in patients of either sex
undergoing general surgery,  xxxd1924xxx  12.5 and 100mg were superior to placebo
in female, but not male, patients , reflecting the lower incidence ofponv in men.
a 50mg intravenous dose of  xxxd1924xxx  was as effective as ondansetron 4mg in
a mixed-gender group (complete response rates 71 vs 64%). intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  12.5 to 100mg was also superior to placebo in treating established pony,
although lower rates of complete response were obtained in this setting (24 to
37%, vs 11% for placebo).
tolerability

the most common adverse events in patients receiving oral or intravenous
 xxxd1924xxx  for prevention of cinv in clinical trials were headache and diarrhoea.
analysis of several trials indicated that headache occurred in approximately 24%,
and diarrhoea in 5 to 12%, of patients receiving intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  1.8 mg/kg
or oral  xxxd1924xxx  100 to 200mg. other events included dizziness and fatigue .
diarrhoea was not considered to be related to  xxxd1924xxx  administration and was
relatively uncommon in patients undergoing surgery and healthy volunteers, who
otherwise showed a similar pattern of adverse events to patients receiving chemotherapy. headache and dizziness were the most common adverse events in those
not receiving chemotherapy, occurring in 7 to 9% and 2 to 6%, respectively, of
surgical patients administered  xxxd1924xxx  12.5mg intravenously or 50mg orally
for prevention of pony. corresponding incidences in placebo recipients were 5
to 7% and 0 to 3%.

dola  xxxd274xxx : a review

as with other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist s, minor ecg changes occurred after
admini stration of  xxxd1924xxx  in both healthy volunteers and patients in clinical
trials. these changes (prolongation of the pr interval , qtc and qrs duration ,
increased heart rate) are generally transient, asymptomatic and/or clinically insignificant.
in comparative studies in patients receiving moderately or highly emetogenic
chemotherapy, intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  1.8 and 2.4 mg/kg were associated with a
similar overall incidence of adverse events to intravenou s granisetron 3mg or
ondansetron 32mg. single oral doses of  xxxd1924xxx  ranging from 25 to 200mg
were as well tolerated overall by patients receiving moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy as 3 to 4 oral doses of ondansetron 8mg.
dosage and
administration

 xxxd1924xxx  is recommended for prevention of acute and delayed cinv and prevention and treatment of pony in adults . a single intravenous dose of 100mg
30 minutes before, or oral dose of 200mg i hour before, emetogenic chemotherapy is recommended for prevention of acute ciny. for prevention of delayed
cinv,  xxxd1924xxx  200mg may be be given once daily orally (total:::;4 days  xxxd1924xxx  therapy per chemotherapy cycle) . concomitant administration of corticosteroids enhance s the efficacy of  xxxd1924xxx  .
for prophylaxis of pony in surgical patients, the recommended dose is
12.5mg intravenously at the end of anaesthesia or 50mg orally before induction
of anaesthesia. a 12.5mg intravenou s dose may be administered for the treatment
of established pony.
 xxxd1924xxx  dosage does not require adjustment on the basis of impaired renal
or hepatic function or advanced age. contraindications to  xxxd1924xxx  use include
markedly prolonged qtc or atrioventri cular block ii to iii and concomit ant therapy with class i or iii antiarrhythmic agents. caution is recommended when using
 xxxd1924xxx  in patients with pre-existing prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals, particularly qtc, and those with significant electrolyte disturbances or underlying cardiac disease.

the introduction of the serotonin, (5-hydroxytryptaminej; 5-htj) antagonists marked an important advance in the management of chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting (cinv).
 xxxd1924xxx  is a pseudopelletierine-derived 5htj antagoni st which has recently become available for clinical use . after systemic administration
it is rapidly converted in vivo to its active major
metabolite, hydrodolasetron (fig . i) . all dosages
referred to in this review are expressed as the mesilate salt (the amount of base can be calculated by
multiplying by 0 .74) .

acute nausea and emesis by provoking release of
serotonin from enterochromaffin cell s within the
gut wall. this leads to stimulation of vagal affe rent
pathways, which subsequently triggers central
emetic pathways. direct activation of the 5-htj
receptors of the chemoreceptor trigger zone (ctz)
may also occur (for reviews see gravesl!' and
veyrat-follet et ai.l2]). radiotherapy appears to induce nausea and vomiting (rinv) by a similar
mechanism.p'
cytotoxic chemotherapy also produces delayed
vomiting (>24 hours after administration) and anticipatory nau sea and vomiting, possibly by different mechanisms. the latter is a conditioned reflex
associated with inadequate control of cinv during
previous cycles of chemotherapy.

the presence of anaesthetic agent s in the blood or
csf may stimulate the ctz. additionally, manipulation of the gut during abdominal surgery may
cause disruption of the enterochromaffin cells [for
reviews of postoperative nau sea and vomiting

receptors see watcha.u' rabey & smithl s1 and parker et aij 61] . figure 2 illustrate s the many factors
which can influence the inciden ce of cinv, rinv
or pony.
 xxxg1116xxx  antagoni sts are believed to induce their antiemetic effects by competitive and
selective binding to 5-ht 3 receptors in the ctz
and in the gastrointestinal tract. in animal and human brain , the highest density of these receptors is
found in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (the
main terminus for afferent vagal impul ses originat© adi s international umited. all right s reserved ,

ing in the gastrointestinal tract) and the area
postrema of the medull a oblongata (the site of the
ctz). however, the relati vely high density of 5ht3receptors found in the human nigrostriatal system contrasts with that found in animal species p i
 xxxd1924xxx  and its metabolites bind selectively
to 5-ht 3 receptors.  xxxd1924xxx  bound to 5-ht 3 receptors in cultured neuroblastoma-glioma cells
with high affinity (dissociation constant; k ; == 20
nmoill).!81 four metabolites of dol asetron also
demon strated high affinity for these 5-ht 3 receptor binding sites. hydrodolasetron had the greatest
affinity,[9, i01 approximately 50-fold greater than
that of the parent compound (k; = 0.44 vs 20.03
nmoill).[i01
 xxxd1924xxx  was a potent antagonist at 5-ht3 receptors on sympathetic nerve terminal s of isolated
perfused rabbit heart (affinity constant; pa2 = 9.8).1 81
it was also a potent inhibitor [concentration required to produce 50% inhibition (lc so) == 4 nmol/l]
of the inward membrane current resulting from application of serotonin to voltage-clamped neurobla stoma-glioma cells.!'ol however, given the
rapid disappearance of the parent compound from
the plasma after admini stration (see section 2), the
clinic al significance of these finding s is doubtful.
 xxxd1924xxx  and its metabolites showed no affinity for 5-ht" 5-ht 2 or other radioligand binding
sites (a- and ~-adrenerg ic, dopaminergic, muscarinic and benzodi azepine receptors) at a concentration of 10 ilmolll,[8,91
 xxxd1924xxx  blocked the serotonin-induced von
bezold-jarisch reflex (transient bradycardia) in the
anaesthetised rat, with an edso of approximately 3
ug/kg after intravenou s admini stration. an intravenous dose of 140 ilg/kg or intraduodenal dose of
i mg/kg completely abolished the reflex for >85
minut es. however, neither dose of  xxxd1924xxx  had
any effect on the secondary fall in blood pressure
which marks the cardiovascular response to serotonin in this species.if

1.2 antiemetic effects

 xxxd1924xxx  suppressed vomiting induced by cisplatin 10 mg/kg in ferrets, when given as a single
dose of 0.5 to 2 mg/kg orally (30 minutes prior to
cisplatin) or 2 doses of 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg intravenously (30 minute s before and 45 minutes after
cisplatin). complete abolition of vomiting was
noted in 4 of 5 and 5 of 5 anim als, respectively,
given the highest oral and intrav enous doses.pl
 xxxd1924xxx  (0. 1 to 3 mg/kg intravenously) decreased the mean number of emetic episode s (from
14.8 to 1 at the highe st dose) and increased the time
to onset of vomiting (from 115 to 259 minutes) in
dogs given cisplatin 3 mg/kg. the se result s were
similar to those obtained with ondansetron (0.15 to
1.5 mg/kg intravenou slyj .pl
data relating to the antiemetic effects of
dola  xxxd274xxx  in patients undergoing chemotherapy,
radiotherapy or surgery are discussed in section 3.
1.3 other effects
1.3.1 behavioural effects

accumulating evidence suggests a link between
serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in the
brain. 5-ht 3 receptors are belie ved to be involved
in many aspects of beha viour, and  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists have been shown in animal model s to
reduce the hyperactivity response to increased
meso limbic dopamine activity, to release suppressed beh aviour, to decrease the reinforcing
properties and withdrawal symptoms of drug s of
abuse (morphine, cocaine, nicot ine), to enhance
cognitive performance and to modulate appetite/
feeding behaviour. although animal models are not
necessarily predictive of effects in humans, these
findings suggest that  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists

may pro ve to have anxi olytic and/or antipsychotic
effects in human s. the postulated role of 5-ht3
receptors in behavioural pharmacology has been
reviewed by several authors.[12-16] the pharmacology and therapeutic potential of ondansetron in
novel applications have been reviewed by wilde
and markharn.uf
 xxxd1924xxx  facilitated latent inhibition in rats (a
model of selective attention), with a similar effect
to the neuroleptic agent haloperidol.u '" intraperitoneal administrati on of dola  xxxd274xxx  (5 mg/kg ) for
21 days to rats significantly reduced the number of
spontaneously active dopaminergic neurons in the
ventr al tegmental area and substantia nigra of the
midbrain. the redu ction was great er than that produced by haloperidol (0.5 mg/k g). thi s suggests
that  xxxd1924xxx  may have antipsychotic activity.' 15,19]
1.3.2 electrophysiological effects

at a concentration of 3 to 10 umol/l in vitro,
dola  xxxd274xxx  and its major metabolite decreased the
maximum depolarisation rate during phase 1 of the
action potential in guinea-pig papillary muscle fibres without significantly affecting the duration of
action potential. thi s was thought to result from
blockage of fast inward sodium channels. however, in contrast to the antiarrhythmi c agent fiecainide, neither compound significantly blocked
hum an heart sodium channel a-subunits expre ssed
in xenopus oocytes at concentrations equi valent to
those achie ved in hum ans during therapeuti c use of
dolaserron .pf in patients and healthy volunteers,
 xxxd1924xxx  has been found to produce slight alteration s in ecg intervals, including prolongation of
the pr interval, qt c and increased heart rate (section4.1 ).

2.1 absorption and distribution

after intravenous or oral administration,  xxxd1924xxx  is rapidly converted by carbonyl reductase
to its active major metabolite, hydrodolasetron.
the parent compound was undetectable in the
plasma 2 to 4 hours after intravenous administration. the mean avc for hydrodolasetron was
almost 14-fold higher than that for the parent compound, after intravenous administration of  xxxd1924xxx  doses ranging from 0.6 to 5 mg/kg.l 25j in
healthy male volunteers, pla sma concentrations of
hydrodolasetron peaked at approximately 0.5 to
0.6 hours after intravenous administrationt-tf'
and 1 hour after oral administration.t-v'"

table i presents summarised pharmacokinetic
data for hydrodolasetron after administration of
 xxxd1924xxx .
2. 1.1 intravenous administration

avc and maximum plasma concentrations
(c max) for hydrodolasetron are dose-proportionalptl
c max values for hydrodolasetron ranged from 65
ug/l after 0.3 mg/kg to 125 ug/l after 0.6 mgt
kg.[26j however, no c max values relating to the recommended doses for prevention of cinv and
pony (l00 and 12.5mg, respectively) have been
published. the mean volume of distribution was
4.15 to 5.5 l/kg in healthy young male volunteers.l 261
drugs 1997 aug; 54 (2)

282

2.1.2 oral administration

c max and avc were dose-proportional after
single oral do ses of  xxxd1924xxx  25 to 200mg. a c max
of 525 ilg/l and avc of 2466 ilg/l. h were
achieved after a dose of 200mg.f29 ]
steady-state plasma concentrations were reached on day 5 of repeated oral administration of
 xxxd1924xxx  25 to 200mg once daily, but c max and
avc values were only slightly higher than on day
i (mean c max values 59 to 633 versus 54 to 525
ilg/l and avc 367 to 3646 versus 360 to 2466
ug/l • h), indicating that accumulation does not
occur after multiple doses.p?'
oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation
was approximately 70% in healthy young menp8]
approximately 80% in young women volunteersl'p'
and 89 % in healthy elderly volunteers.u'" in children aged 2 to 12 years, bioavailability of orally
administered  xxxd1924xxx  (formulation unspecified)
was only approximately 59 %)31] food intake did
not affect the pharmacokinetic disposition of orally
administered  xxxd1924xxx .[34]

2.2 metabolism and elimination
oxidation of the indole ring of hydrodolasetron
by cyp450 enzymes at positions 5, 6 and 7 yields
hydroxyl derivatives ; n-oxidation also occurs.
these metabolites are then excreted as glucuronide
and/or sulfate conjugates.pf studies with human
liver microsomes showed that the cyp2d6 isoenzyme (which is implicated in the defect in drug
metabolism referred to as  xxxd1818xxx /sparteine
polymorphism) was involved in metabolism of
hydrodolasetronj36] volunteers who were characterised as ' extensive metabolisers' (based on presence of the cyp2d6 allele) were found to eliminate hydrodolasetron by both renal excretion and
further biotransformation, whereas 'poor metabolisers ' eliminated this metabolite mainly by renal
excretion.[34]
renal clearance of hydrodolasetron in healthy
male volunteers ranged from 0.13 to 0.2  xxxg1778xxx /kg and
total clearance from 0.61 to 0.94  xxxg1778xxx /kg (table i).
elimination of  xxxd1924xxx  and its major metabolite
was independent of the dose adrninistered.f'! the

mean plasma elimination half-life (tll2p) of hydrodolasetron ranged from 4 to 8 hours after intravenous admini stration[25. 261 and 5 to 10 hours after
oral administrationl-sl (table i).
after a single oral 300mg dose of radiolabelled
 xxxd1924xxx , 59 % of the radiolabel was recovered in
the urine and 25 % in the faeces. hydrodolasetron
accounted for most of an intravenous or oral dose
recovered in the urine (usually 20 to 38% ; table i).
less than i % of a dose of  xxxd1924xxx  was excreted
intact in the urine of healthy volunteersj25] hydrodolasetron has a chiral centre and the r( +)-enantiomer predominated [r( +) : s(-) ratio of 9 : i)] in the
urine)35j

2.3 effects of age, gender and disease
on pharmacokinetics
in patients with mildly to severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearances not stated) who
received  xxxd1924xxx  200mg intravenou sly and
orally in cro ssover sequence, 'renal clearance of
hydrodolasetron and the fraction of the do se excreted in the urine decreased in proportion to the
degree of renal impairment. avc was increased up
to approximately 2-fold. however, no values were
given for any of these parameters in this abstract
report. the investigators concluded that there is no
need to adjust  xxxd1924xxx  dosage on the basi s of
impaired renal function.[37] the pharmacokinetic
disposition of  xxxd1924xxx  (0.6 to 3.0 mg/kg) in 299
patients with various types of cancer who were
undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy did not differ
from that in healthy volunteers.uf
the pharmacokinetics of hydrodolasetron did
not appear to be influenced substantially by gender.
although no studies comparing identical doses in
men and women appear to have been performed,
tll2p values in women were slightly higher than
in men (e.g. 8.1 vs 4 .2 to 7.9 hours after intravenous administration ; table i).
it has been sugges ted that the elimination of
hydrodolasetron may be more rapid in children
than in adults . in children aged 2 to 12 years who
received  xxxd1924xxx  1.2 mg/kg orally prior to elective surgery, the apparent total clearance of the acdrugs 1997 aug ; 54 (2)

283

dola  xxxd274xxx : a review

tive metabolite was relatively high ( 1.3  xxxg1778xxx /kg),
but the t ll2p (5.7 hours) was within the wide range
measured in healthy young adult s-'!' (see table i).
the authors suggested that greater metabolism of
hydrodolasetron may occur in children compared
with adults. bioavailability of the reduced metabolite after oral administration was only approximately 59%, which is lower than values reported
in adult s (section 2.1.2).
in elderly volunteers (aged 65 to 75 years), the
pharmacokinetics of hydrodolasetron were similar
to those measured in young volunteers (table i)j32]
3. therapeutic potential

 xxxd1924xxx  has been evaluated for the management of nausea and vomiting induced by moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy, by radiotherapy and by surgery. for evaluation of
prophylaxis again st acute nausea and vomiting, patients were monitored for 24 hours after surgery or
administration of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
one study also evaluated  xxxd1924xxx  as prophylaxis
again st delayed cinvj39] mea surement of antiemetic efficac y was based on the number of emetic
episode s and need for rescue medication. complete respon se (the primary efficacy parameter)
was defined as no emesis and no rescue medication, major response as ~2 emetic episodes but no
rescue medication and failure as >2 emetic episodes or requirement for rescue medication. other
efficacy parameters assessed included time to first
emetic episode, patient-assessed severity of nausea
and satisfaction with antiemetic therapy. the latter
2 variables were assessed using a visual analogue
scale.
in studies of cinv and rinv, patients had a
variety of cancer types.
as well as type of chemotherapy given, antiemetic respon se is affected by demographic factors, including gender, age, alcohol consumption
and whether patient s have received previou s chemotherapy. thus, in many large comparative studies, patient s were prestratified according to gender
(cinv and pony studie s) and previou s chemotherapy (cinv studies ).l40-431

3.1 chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting

acute cinv usually start s i to 2 hours after
admini stration of chemotherapy, peaking at 4 to 10
hour s and resolving or subsiding within 12 to 24
hour s. regimen s containing cisplatin ~50 rng/mare highly emetogenic, causing acute eme sis in
>90 % of patients. delayed cinv occurs 1 to 5
days after chemotherapy and is experienced by
most patients treated with cisplatin >50 mg/m 2. [ i ]
 xxxd1924xxx  has been evaluated as single dose
prophylaxis against acute nausea and vomiting in
patients receiving moderately or highly ernetogenic chemotherapy. data from several dose-ranging
and comparative studies are presented in tables ii
and iii. repeated doses of the drug were also evaluated for prophylaxis against delayed nausea and
vomiting in one study (section 3.1.3). antiemetic
study drugs were generally administered 30 minutes to i hour before chemotherapy.  xxxd1924xxx  has
been compared with other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists (ondansetron and granisetron; section 3.1.3 )
and metoclopramide (section 3.1.4 ).
3. 1. 1 intravenous administration

intravenou s dose s ranging from 0.3 to 5.0
mg/kg or 10 to 50mg were evaluated (tables ii and
iii). the most effective intravenous dose was 1.8
mg/kg in most studies. in general, doses higher
than this were either less effective or similarly effective, whereas a dose of 0.3 mg/kg was clearly
insufficienr.t'f this was confirmed by analysis of
data from 8 clinical trials involving 1587 patients.l 51] audhuy et aij 52] analysed data from 14
trials , conve rting the  xxxd1924xxx  doses from milligrams per kilogram to milligrams, based on patients' weights . they concluded that a 100mg intravenous dose produced the best response . conroy
et al.l44] evaluated intravenous dose s on a milligram basis, but the highest dose studied was 50mg .
this produced the best respon se.
 xxxd1924xxx  1.8 mg/kg generally achieved complete response rates of approximately 50% after
highly emetogenic, and 60 to 80% after moderately
emetogenic, chemotherapy (table s ii and iii). kris

tho se who received  xxxd1924xxx  200mg, compared
with 72 % ofthose who recei ved ondansetron (table
iii»)42]

however, a 2.4 mg/kg intravenous dose of
do lasetron was less effective than intravenous
ondansetron 32mg , providing complete protection
against acute cinv in 193 of 343 (56 %) versus 230
of 353 (65%) chemotherapy-naive patients (p =
0.019) who received moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy with or without dexamethasone.pvvl
patients continued to recei ve antiemetic drugs
orall y for a further 6 days as prophylaxis against
delayed nausea and vomiting:  xxxd1924xxx  200
mg/day or ondansetron 8mg twice daily with or
witho ut dexamethasone (8mg daily) or dexamethasone alone. continuation of  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist therapy improved the complete control
rate only slightly compared with dexamethasone
alone : complete response over the full 7 days was
obtained in 47 % of those who recei ved dexamethasone with a 5-ht3receptor antagoni st versus 41 %
of tho se who recei ved dexamethasone alone . however, it was not stated whether patients in this study
were prestratified by gender.
3.1.4 comparisons with metoclopramide

kg divided regimen) in 2 randomised, double-blind
studies)40ai] both studies enrolled >200 patients
who recei ved moderatelyl -u or highly[40] emetogenic chemotherapy.
 xxxd1924xxx  1.2 or 1.8 mg/kg was significantly
superior to metoclopramide 7 mg/kg in preventing
eme sis induced by high dose cisplatin ;;:::80 mg/m '',
complete response was achieved in 48 % (p <
0.006 vs metoclopramide) and 57 % (p < 0.00 1 vs
metoclopramide) versus 35% of patients. dolaset© ad is interna tio nal umite d . all rig hts reserved.

ron 1.8 mg/kg was also reported to be significantly
superior to metoclopramide in time to first emetic
episode, severity of nausea, patient sati sfaction and
inve stigator globa l assessment of efficacy. it was
also superior to  xxxd1924xxx  1.2 mg/kg with respect
to complete plus major response rate (p < 0.05 all
comparisons).[40]
in patients who received moderately emetogen ic chemotherapy (mostly doxorubicin,  xxxd2008xxx  or cyclophosphamide), dola  xxxd274xxx  1.2 and 1.8
mg/kg exhibited similar efficacy to metoclopramide 5 mg/kg in the group as a whole. however,
subgroup analysis revealed that both doses of
 xxxd1924xxx  were more effec tive than metoclopramide in female patients. the difference between
the regimens was more pronounced in female patient s who had rece ived previous chemotherapy. in
this high risk group, complete plus major respon se
rate s were 74 and 72 % for the 2  xxxd1924xxx  groups
vers us 46 % for the metoclopramide group (p <
0.038 and 0.034 ). additionally, both dose s of dol asetron were superior to metoclopramide for inve stigator-rated global efficacy (p = 0.048 and p =
0.015 , respectively) in the group as a whole)41]
3.1.5 coadministration of dexamethasone

as observed with other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists, addition of dexamethasone enhanced the efficacy of  xxxd1924xxx . in 696 patients who recei ved
either intravenou s  xxxd1924xxx  2.4 mg/kg or intravenou s ondansetron 32mg before treatm ent with
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, complete
response was achieved in 265 of 402 (66 %) who
did , versus 158 of 294 (54 %) who did not, receive
concomitant dexamethasone 8mg (p < 0.00 i). the
effect of dexamethasone was more pronounced after 7 day s' oral treatment (with  xxxd1924xxx  200 mgt
day or ondansetron 8mg twice daily with or without dexamethasone 8 mg/day) for protection against
dela yed cinv (complete respo nse rate 47 vs 28% ;
p < 0.001 ).[391

receptor antagonists alone in patients receiving
highly emetogenic chemotherapy and similar to
that achieved in patients receiving moderately
emetogenic chemotherapy. however, without a
control group receiving only  xxxd1924xxx , it is difficult to asses s the contribution of dexamethasone in
this study. administration of a second dose of this
regimen after 16 hours did not enhance the efficacy
rate or delay the time to onset of eme sis.l 58]
3.1.6 factors affecting response

as observed with other antiemetic therapies,
gender, age, alcohol consumption and prior chemotherapy were major factors in determining response to  xxxd1924xxx  . male sex,[40-42,48.56.57] age
>65 years,[48,50] a history of heavy alcohol use[40.57]
and no previous chemotherapy[40,42.56] were sign ificant predictors of good response.
for instance, in patients who received dolaset ron 1.8 mg/kg in the largest of these studies,[57]
complete response was documented in 73 of 127
(58%) male versus 15 of71 (21 %) female patients
(p = 0.001 ) and in 23 of 35 (66%) of those with,
versu s 65 of 163 (40%) of those without, a history
of heavy alcohol use (p = 0.00 i). it has been suggested that prior chemotherapy is predictive of a
poor response to antiemetic therapy only if emesis
occurred during a previous cycle.p?'
3.1.7 use in children

intravenous doses of  xxxd1924xxx  ranging from
0.6 to 2.4 mg/kg were evaluated in 46 children undergoing moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy. complete response rates ranged from 10%
with the 0.6 mg/kg dose to 67% with the 1.8 mg/kg
dose. however, few details of methodology and results were provided in this abstract report.[60]
3.2 radiotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting

rinv is not as severe or predictable as ciny.
however, radiotherapy is often adm inistered over
an extended period (fractionated), so the duration
of nau sea and vomiting may be longer. the acute
pha se usually starts about 30 to 90 minutes after
irradiation and lasts for up to 6 hours. the severity

depends on the dosage and type of radiation, administration schedule and the body location and
area of the irradiation field , as well as individual
sen sitivity. single high doses of radiotherapy
which include the upper abdomen induce nausea
and vomiting in over 80% of patients.l61.62]
 xxxd1924xxx  was evaluated in the prevention of
nausea and vomiting induced by high dose radiotherapy[ 63.64 1 or total body irradiation followed by
chemotherapy.l'vl all studies were dose-ranging:
however, the small numbers of patients in each
treatment group (studies enrolled 20 to 76 patients)
preclude any conclusions regarding the most appropriate dose of  xxxd1924xxx  in this setting (table iv).
20 patients with acute leukaemia scheduled to
undergo bone marrow transplantation received oral
 xxxd1924xxx  50, 100 or 150mg twice daily prior to
fractionated total body irradiation. complete response was documented in 40, 100 and 57 % of patients after 3 days' radiotherapy. a further single
200mg dose given prior to 2 days of subsequent
chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/
day produced complete or major respon se in 7 of
10 patients.l'v'
in the other 2 studies,  xxxd1924xxx  was administered intravenously 15 to 30 minutes before a single dose of radiotherapy'vt' or prior to each dose of
fractionated high dose radiotherapy.ls-l a significant dose-response relationship was found between dose s of  xxxd1924xxx  20 to 50mg and complete
response rates (p = 0.002). the best results were
obtained with the 40 and 50mg doses (complete
response rates of 100 and 92% , respectivelyj.i'<' in
the placebo-controlled study,  xxxd1924xxx  0.3 mg/kg
was superior to placebo in producing complete
response (91 vs 54 % of patients) and control of
nausea. both this dose and  xxxd1924xxx  0.6 mg/kg
were superior to placebo for complete or major response. the low rate of complete response obtained with the highest  xxxd1924xxx  dosage (1.2
mg/kg; 58%) may reflect the relatively high proportion of patients who had undergone previous chemotherapy.l64]

3.3 postoperative nausea and vomiting

in addition to age and gender, other factors influencing the incidence and severity of pony are
the type of surgery and type of anaesthetic agent
used. the recent introduction of newer anaesthetic
agents such as propofol appears to have contributed to a decline in the incidence of pony'14,5] as
pony is generally experienced by fewer than onethird of patients overall , routine prophylactic use
of antiemetics prior to surgery is relatively uncommon . nevertheless, these agent s are often given to
patients at high risk of pony.14]
 xxxd1924xxx  has been evaluated in the treatment[66] and prophylaxis[67-7o j of pony (table v).
all studies were placebo-controlled and enrolled
>280 patients. several were reported as abstracts.

indeed, an analysis of pooled data from studies involving i 946 patients (mostly fema le) indicated
that the 12.5mg dose was superior to placebo (complete response rate 55 vs 41 %) and increasing the
dose above this level did not enhance efficacy.pf
oral do lase tro n doses ranging from 25 to
200mg were superior to place bo in preventing
pony in women undergoing gynaecological surgery, with the 50mg dose producing the best response (57% complete response rate).l7°1 in another study, oral  xxxd1924xxx  100 and 200mg were
both superior to placebo in preventing nausea and
vomiting in women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. comp lete responses were obtained in 54
and 50% of patients, respectively, compared with
29 % of placebo rec ipients. response rates for
lower doses were not specified .f'l
however, in a mixed-gender group of patients
undergoing general outpatie nt surgery (n = 1030,
prestratified by gender),  xxxd1924xxx  ( 12.5 to 100mg
intravenously) was not significantly superior to
placebo overal l. indeed, dola  xxxd274xxx  gave similar
results to placebo in male patients, consistent with
the observation that only 30% of male (v s 60% of
fema le) placebo recipients experienced vomiting.
in cont rast, subgroup analysis showed that  xxxd1924xxx  12.5 and 100mg were superior to placebo in

comparison with placebo

when used for treating established nausea and

 xxxd1924xxx  12.5 to 100mg was administered intravenously to those who experienced ~ i emetic episode or nausea lasting >5 minutes[73l or 15 minutes)66l relatively low response rates were
obtai ned (24 to 37%). nevertheless, all doses studied were significantly more effective than placebo
(com plete response rate of 11 % in both studies)
and there appea red to be no benefit in increa sing
the dose above 12.5mg[66.73l (see table v). this was

12% of patients receiving intravenous  xxxd1924xxx 
1.8 mg/kg (n = 695), with corresponding incidences of 23% and 5 to 6%, respectively in those

overall, adverse event s occurred in 58 % and 55%
of patients. other events included dizziness, fatigue and abnormal hepatic function (either elevated transaminases or not defined). it is likely that
diarrhoea was related to chemotherapy rather than
to  xxxd1924xxx  treatment, as chemotherapy often
causes diarrhoea and dola  xxxd274xxx  does not affect colonic transit time p 61

events occurred in 94 of 163 (58%) and 88 of 161
(55%) versus 67 of 150 (45%) patients treated with
 xxxd1924xxx  1.8 rug/kg ,  xxxd1924xxx  2.4 mg/kg and
granisetron 3mg, respectively. headache and diarrhoea were the most common events with both
agents. diarrhoea was approximately twice as
common in patients receiving  xxxd1924xxx  as in
those receiving granisetron, but as with other adverse events, this difference was not statistically
significant. 1561
single oral doses of  xxxd1924xxx  ranging from 25
to 200mg were as well tolerated overall by patients
receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy
(mostly cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin) as 3 to 4 oral doses of ondansetron 8mg.
adverse events occurred in 25 to 40% of  xxxd1924xxx  recipients and 36% of ondansetron recipients

dosages of  xxxd1924xxx  ranging from 0.6 to 2.4
mg/kg were well tolerated by paediatric patients
undergoing moderately to highly emetogenic
chemotherapy. the pattern of adverse events was
similar to that seen in adults .1601
5. dosage and administration

 xxxd1924xxx  is available in oral and intravenous
dosage forms . it is only recommended for use in
adults at present, as insufficient data are available
regarding use in children. for prevention of acute
cinv, a single dose of  xxxd1924xxx  100mg intravenously or 200mg orally may be administered 30
minutes or 1 hour, respectively, before emetogenic
chemotherapy. to protect against delayed cinv, a
single oral daily dose of  xxxd1924xxx  200mg may be
be given, to a maximum total of 4 consecutive

given concomitantly with corticosteroids.
for use in preventing pony in surgical patients, a single l2.5mg  xxxd1924xxx  dose given intravenously at the end of anaesthesia or a 50mg oral
dose before induction of anaesthesia is recommended. a 12.5mg intravenous dose is recommended for treatment of established pony.
 xxxd1924xxx  dosage does not need to be adjusted
on the basis of impaired renal or hepatic function
or advanced age. the drug is contraindicated in
patients with a markedly prolonged qtc or atrioventricular block ii to iii and those receiving class
i or iii antiarrhythmic agents . caution is recommended when  xxxd1924xxx  is administered to patients with pre-existing prolongation of cardiac
conduction intervals , particularly qtc, and those
with significant electrolyte disturbances or underlying cardiac disease)8j,82j

6. potential place of  xxxd1924xxx  in the
management of nausea and vomiting
induced by chemotherapy,
radiotherapy or surgery
effective control of nausea and vomiting can be
important for the success of antineoplastic therapy ,
since nausea and vomiting can result in dose limitation, anticipatory emesis over successive cycles
and refusal of treatment. moreover, persistent
vomiting can cause metabolic derangements and
deterioration of the patient's general condition.i!'
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists have become the
standard treatment for preventing cinv induced
by cisplatin-containing regimens . they are generally given in combination with dexamethasone.
prior to the introduction of 5-ht 3 receptor antagonists, a range of antiemetic agents were used, including high dose metocloprarnide, other dopamine antagonists, corticosteroids, phenothiazines,
benzodiazepines and antihistamines. however,
drugs 1997 aug; 54 (2)

 xxxd1924xxx : a revi ew

emesis induced by highly emetogenic regimens,
particularly those containing cisplatin, is not generally sufficiently controlled with traditional antiemetics. moreover, the extrapyramidal adverse effects of dopamine antagonists are a drawback to
their use in this setting, particularly in children .[1.83] available  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists include the prototype compound ondansetron,184]
granisetron'p l and  xxxd3451xxx . pf because of their
higher acquisition costs compared with conventional agents , it is important to define the patient
populations for whom their extra costs are most
likely to be justified.
clinical trials have shown that single intravenous or oral doses of  xxxd1924xxx  are effective in
preventing acute ciny. an intravenous dose of 1.8
mg/kg generally achieved complete respon se rates
of approximatel y 50% after highly emetogenic,
and 60 to 80% after moderately emetogenic,
chemotherapy. an oral dose of 200mg produced
similar results in the latter setting. as with ondansetron[84] and granisetron.pf the antiemetic efficacy of  xxxd1924xxx  is enhanced by concomitant administration of dexamethasone (section 3.1.5) . as
with other 5-ht 3 receptor antagonists, the role of
 xxxd1924xxx  in protecting against delayed nausea
and vomiting require s further study) 43]
in comparative studies, intravenous  xxxd1924xxx 
1.8 mglkg was as effective as single doses of granisetron 3mg or ondansetron 32mg in patients receiving highl y emetogenic chemotherapy and oral
 xxxd1924xxx  200mg was as effective as multiple oral
doses of ondansetron 32mg in patients receiving
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. dola  xxxd274xxx  was more effective than high dose metoclopramide in preventing emesis after highly emetogenic
chemotherapy. although similar to metoclopramide overall in patient s receiving moderately ernetogenic chemotherapy, dola  xxxd274xxx  was superior in
high risk subgroups, particularly in female patients
who had received previou s chemotherapy.
preliminary dose-ranging studies indicate that
 xxxd1924xxx  is also effective in preventing riny. an
intravenous dose of 40mg achieved complete response rates of 100% and a dose of 0.3 mg/kg was
e

adis inte rna tio nal lim ited . all rtghts rese rved .

superior to placebo. however, the small numbers
of patients studied do not permit any conclusions
regarding the optimum dosage of  xxxd1924xxx  in this
indication.
although routine prophylactic use of antiemetics prior to surgery is relatively uncommon, these
agent s may be used in patients undergoing types of
surgery associated with a particularly high risk of
pony (such as laparo scopic surgery in women,
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in adult s of
either sex, or strabismus surgery, otoplasty, tonsilloadenoidectomy or orchiopexy in children) or in
high-risk subgroups undergoing other types of surgery)4 1 intravenous or oral  xxxd1924xxx  doses ranging from 12.5 to 100mg and 25 to 200mg, respectively, were superior to placebo in preventing
pony in women undergoing gynaecological surgery. in patients undergoing general surgery, intravenou s  xxxd1924xxx  12.5 and 100mg were superior
to placebo in female patients only, reflecting a
lower incidence of pony in male patients . a 50mg
intravenous dose of  xxxd1924xxx  was as effective as
ondansetron 4mg in preventing pony in a mixed
gender group. intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  12.5 to
100mg was also effective in treating established
pony, although response rates were relatively low
in this setting compared with prevention studies
(complete respon se rates 24 to 37% vs ii % for
placebo). it should be noted that propofol (which
is associated with less pony than other anaesthetic agentslpl) was not used in any of these studies.
the tolerability profile of  xxxd1924xxx  is characteristic of this class of compounds, with headache,
dizziness and diarrhoea being the most common
adverse events , although diarrhoea is not thought
to be related to  xxxd1924xxx  treatment and occurs
infrequently in patients not recei ving chemotherapy (section 4).  xxxd1924xxx  and other 5-ht3receptor antagonists have cardiac electrophysiological
activity, causing minor changes in ecg intervals.
these effects generally do not appear to be clinically important, but caution appears warranted if
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists are used concurrently
with other drugs which affect cardiac rhythm or in
drugs 1997 aug: 54 (2)

patients with pre-existing arrhythmias (see section
5 for recommendations regarding  xxxd1924xxx  ).
these aspect s require further study.
thus, available data suggest that  xxxd1924xxx  will
provide an alternative to other  xxxg1116xxx  antagoni sts for the management of cinv and of
pony in susceptible group s. further studies are
required to determine whether it offer s any advantages over other agents in these indication s. the
potential of  xxxd1924xxx  in preventing rinv also
warrants further investigation to defin e the optimal
dosage.
