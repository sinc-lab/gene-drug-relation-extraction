abstract
2-[4-(3,4-dimethylphenlyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-ylmethyl]-1h benzoimidazole (a-381393) was identiÔ¨Åed as a potent  xxxg658xxx 
antagonist with excellent receptor selectivity. [3h]-spiperone competition binding assays showed that a-381393 potently bound to
membrane from cells expressing recombinant human dopamine d4.4 receptor (ki z 1.5 nm), which was 20-fold higher than that of
clozapine (ki z 30.4 nm). a-381393 exhibited highly selective binding for the dopamine d4.4 receptor (o2700-fold) when compared
to d1, d2, d3 and d5 dopamine receptors. furthermore, in comparison to clozapine and l-745870, a-381393 exhibits better
receptor selectivity, showing no aÔ¨Énity up to 10 mm for a panel of more than 70 receptors and channels, with the exception of
moderate aÔ¨Énity for 5-ht2a (ki z 370 nm). a-381393 potently inhibited the functional activity of agonist-induced gtp-g-s
binding assay and 1 mm dopamine induced-ca2c Ô¨Çux in human dopamine d4.4 receptor expressing cells, but not in human
dopamine d2l or  xxxg657xxx  cells. in contrast to l-745870, a-381393 did not exhibit any signiÔ¨Åcant intrinsic activity in a d4.4
receptor. in vivo, a-381393 has good brain penetration after subcutaneous administration. a-381393 inhibited penile erection
induced by the selective d4 agonist pd168077 in conscious rats. thus, a-381393 is a novel selective d4 antagonist that will enhance
the ability to study dopamine d4 receptors both in vitro and in vivo.

the cloning and identiÔ¨Åcation of the dopamine d4
receptor as a high aÔ¨Énity clozapine binding site led to the
hypothesis that blockade of this receptor played a key
role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (van tol
et al., 1991; wong and van tol, 2003a,b). in the clinic,
the atypical neuroleptic clozapine is eÔ¨Écacious against
positive symptoms of schizophrenia and also has limited
eÔ¨Écacy for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia
(wong and van tol, 2003a). the pharmacological

113

mechanism of action of clozapine‚Äôs unique clinical proÔ¨Åle
has not been unequivocally explained due to its aÔ¨Énity
for many neurotransmitter receptors (schmidt et al.,
2001; wilson et al., 1998; wong and van tol, 2003a).
the observation that clozapine binds to the dopamine
 xxxg658xxx  with the highest aÔ¨Énity compared to other
members of the dopamine receptor family has led to
speculations that the mechanism of action of clozapine
may be related to antagonism of dopamine d4 receptors
(hrib, 2000; wong and van tol, 2003a,b).
in order to test this hypothesis, it was necessary to
develop selective dopamine d4 antagonists (kulagowski
et al., 1996). the dopamine d4 selective antagonist l745870 was highly selective for dopamine d4 receptors
and potently blocked dopamine inhibition of forskolininduced camp synthesis in chinese hamster ovary
(cho) cells (kulagowski et al., 1996; patel et al., 1997).
interestingly, this compound did not exhibit a neuroleptic-like proÔ¨Åle in rat animal models of schizophrenia
(bristow et al., 1997a). a limited phase 2 human clinical
trial failed to demonstrate improvement of the symptoms of schizophrenics with l-745870 vs. placebo
(bristow et al., 1997b; kramer et al., 1997). the
pharmacology of l-745870 was further complicated by
the demonstration that in both camp and calcium Ô¨Çux
assays that weak partial agonist activity could be
detected (gazi et al., 1998, 1999; stewart et al., 2004).
however, the eÔ¨Écacy and potencies determined depended in some reports on receptor number and even
assay type. since the Ô¨Årst clinical trials with l-745870,
other clinical trials of dopamine d4 selective antagonists
have been conducted including a neutral antagonist
 xxxd3224xxx  but none of the compounds examined
have shown eÔ¨Écacy in the treatment of schizophrenia
(corrigan et al., 2004; hrib, 2000).
the neurophysiologic role of dopamine d4 receptors
remains to be deÔ¨Åned. recently it has been reported that
activation of central dopamine d4 receptors induces
penile erection in conscious rats (hsieh et al., 2004;
brioni et al., 2004). the  xxxg658xxx  may also
play a key role in cognition, novelty seeking behavior,
attention deÔ¨Åcit disorder and other central nervous system disorders as suggested by gene deletion experiments
in rodents, (avale et al., 2004; viggiano et al., 2003).

a search for selective  xxxg658xxx  ligands
using a functional calcium Ô¨Çux assay to distinguish
agonist and antagonist activities (moreland et al.,
2004a) led to the identiÔ¨Åcation of both classes of
compounds (cowart et al., 2004) (fig. 1). while our
initial discovery eÔ¨Äort focused on identiÔ¨Åcation of
agonists, a structurally related antagonist was desirable
as a research tool. we report here the biological proÔ¨Åle
of a-381393 ( xxxd3171xxx  in cowart et al., 2004),
a novel selective and potent antagonist for the dopamine
 xxxg658xxx  that lacks any signiÔ¨Åcant intrinsic agonist
activity.

2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals
fluo-4 and pluronic f-127 were purchased from
molecular probes. dpbs, neomycin, hygromycin b and
tissue culture reagents were from invitrogen/life technologies. pd168077 (n-[4-(2-cyanophenyl)-piperazin1-ylmethyl]-3-methyl-benzamide) was synthesized by
abbott laboratories (matulenko et al., 2004). all other
chemicals were purchased from sigma unless otherwise
noted.
2.2. synthesis of a-381393 (2-[4-(3,4-dimethyl-phenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-ylmethyl]-1h-benzoimidazole)
to a rapidly stirred solution of 1 g (5.3 mmol) of 3,4dimethylpiperazine in 6 ml of dmf in a round bottom
Ô¨Çask in a water bath at 20  c was added 0.79 g (4.7 mmol)
of 2-chloromethylbenzimidazole over 2 min. triethylamine (2 ml, 3 eq) was added, and the reaction was
stirred for 24 h, at which time tlc indicated complete
consumption of starting material. the reaction was
worked up by pouring into dichloromethane and
washing with 1 m ammonium hydroxide, and concentration in vacuo. this was recrystallized from ethyl
acetate/hexane to give 0.80 g (52% yield puriÔ¨Åed) of
a white powder, m.p. 197e198  c. 1h nmr (cd3od,

2.3. radioligand binding assays
assays were carried out as described previously
(miller et al., 1999; altenbach et al., 2004; moreland
et al., 2004b). for dopamine receptor binding assays,
human dopamine d4.4 receptor-transfected hek-293
cells were cultured in dmem supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (invitrogen, rockville,
md). for membrane preparation, the cells were seeded
into a cell factory (vwr, plainÔ¨Åeld, nj) and the
conÔ¨Çuent cells were rinsed with pbs and detached with
cell dissociation buÔ¨Äer (invitrogen). the resulting cell
suspension was centrifuged the pellet was homogenized
by polytron for 10 s in 50 mm trisehcl, ph 7.4.
membrane aliquots were stored at √ø80  c until use.
membranes containing recombinant human d4.2 and
d4.7 receptors were obtained from perkin elmer life
sciences (boston, ma). binding assays were initiated by
an addition of 250 ml of membrane to 200 ml (Ô¨Ånal
0.1 nm) of [3h]-spiperone (amersham bioscience, piscataway, nj, 88 ci/mmol) and were incubated at room
temperature for 2 h. nonspeciÔ¨Åc binding was determined in the presence of 10 mm haloperidol. the
incubation buÔ¨Äer consisted of 50 mm trisehcl, ph
7.4, 5 mm kcl, 120 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl2, and
1 mm edta. the reaction was terminated by rapid
Ô¨Åltration through unifilter-96 gf/b Ô¨Ålers, using
a filtermate harvester (packard, meriden, ct). filters
were washed three times with 1 ml of ice cold 50 mm
trisehcl, ph 7.4. radioactivity was measured by
topcount microplate scintillation counter (packard,
meriden, ct). proteins were determined by bca
protein assay kit (pierce, rockford, il) using bsa as
a standard. radioligand competitive binding assays for
human  xxxg657xxx  were carried out using membranes
derived from hek-293 cells expressing recombinant
receptors (gift of dr. liliane unger). radioligand
competitive binding assays for rat  xxxg1108xxx 
were carried out using membranes derived from rat
cortex expressing recombinant receptors and agonist
[3h]-8-hydroxy-dpat (ne nuclear, boston, ma) (de
vry and jentzsch, 1998). all assays were performed in
triplicate and ic50 values were converted to ki values by
the method of cheng and prusoÔ¨Ä (1973).
2.4. agonist-stimulated europium-gtp(gtp-eu)
binding assay
gtp-eu binding assay was carried out as previously
reported (hsieh et al., 2004) (delfia gtp-binding
kit, perkin elmer life science, boston, ma). in the

preliminary experiments, the assay conditions were
optimized, and nonspeciÔ¨Åc binding was measured in
the presence of 100 mm gtp-gs. diÔ¨Äerent concentrations of ligand (0.1e10,000 nm) were incubated with
8 mg of membranes containing human dopamine d4.2
receptors (perkin elmer life science) in gtp-eu
binding buÔ¨Äer containing 50 mm hepes, ph 7.4,
10 mm mgcl, 25 mm nacl, saponin 100 mg/ml, 1 mm
gdp and 10 nm gtp-eu at room temperature for
40 min. the reaction was terminated by rapid Ô¨Åltration
and the Ô¨Ålter was washed three times with 225 ml of icecold washing solution in a vacuum manifold. the plate
was measured using time-resolved Ô¨Çuorometer, 1420
victor√¥ multilabel counter. basal gtp-eu was
measured in the absence of ligand. percentage of
stimulation was calculated as 100 times the diÔ¨Äerence
between the counts of agonist and 10 mm of dopaminestimulated binding. ec50s were calculated by analyzing
the data by nonlinear regression curve-Ô¨Åtting program
(prism, graphpad software, san diego, ca).
2.5. fluorometric imaging plate reader (flipr)
calcium Ô¨Çux assay
assays were carried out as described previously
(moreland et al., 2004a). cells were plated into 96-well
biocoat black-wall/clear-bottom microplates (becton
dickinson, boston, ma) at 20,000 cells per well. after
two days of culture, the culture medium was removed by
aspiration and replaced by 0.1 ml of dpbs containing
0.04% pluronic f-127 and 4 mm fluo-4, Ô¨Çuorescent
calcium indicator dye. after incubation for 1 h at room
temperature, the cells were washed four times with
dpbs in a plate washer (molecular devices, sunnyvale,
ca). after the Ô¨Ånal wash, 150 ml of dpbs was added to
each well. fluorometric imaging plate reader (flipr384, molecular devices) transferred 50 ml from the
compound plate to the cells and made Ô¨Çuorescence
reading for 3 min (every second for the Ô¨Årst minute and
every 5 s for the next 2 min). the instrument software
normalizes the Ô¨Çuorescent reading to give equivalent
initial readings at time zero and all the data were
normalized with the response of 10 mm dopamine.
2.6. rat penile erection assay
assays for penile erection in conscious rats were
performed as described (hsieh et al., 2004). male adult
wistar rats, weighing w300 g, were used as an animal
model to study penile erection in vivo. all experiments
were carried out between 9:00 am and 3:00 pm. on the
day of testing, animals were allowed to adapt to
a diÔ¨Äusely illuminated testing room with red light for 1 h
before the start of the experiment. rats were placed
individually into a transparent plexiglas cage (20 !
30 ! 30 cm) immediately after the drug injection.

115

a mirror was placed behind and under the observation
cages to facilitate observation of the animals. each rat
was used only once. a penile erection was considered to
occur when the following behaviors were presented:
repeated pelvic thrusts immediately followed by an
upright position, and an emerging, engorged penis that
the rat proceeded to groom. pd168077 and a-381393
were freshly prepared and administered to rats via
subcutaneous injection into the back neck area above
the left scapula (1 ml/kg injection volume). in the pharmacological blockade experiments, rats were injected
s.c. with a-381393 before pd168077 (0.3 mmol/kg)
injection. penile erection episodes were recorded by
direct observation for a period of 60 min after the
compound dosing, and erection incidence (percentage)
was deÔ¨Åned as the percentage of animals exhibiting one
or more erections during the observation period. data
were expressed as incidence (percentage) g s.e.m.
calculated by using wald equation. statistical evaluation of the results was performed by c2 test. a p ! 0.05
was considered signiÔ¨Åcant.

pharmacokinetic proÔ¨Åling. at selected time points after
dosing, groups of three rats were euthanized with co2
and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. the brain
tissues were removed from each rat. plasma and brains
were stored frozen (√ø20  c) prior to analysis. brain
tissue was homogenized with two volumes of water.
a-381393 was removed from measured aliquots of brain
homogenate and plasma using a single liquideliquid
extraction with ethyl acetate: hexane (1:1, by volume) at
alkaline ph. the organic phase was evaporated to
dryness with a gentle stream of dry nitrogen at low heat
(w35  c). spiked plasma and brain homogenate standards were analyzed simultaneously with the samples.
following reconstitution with mobile phase, the
a-381393 was separated from co-extracted contaminants using reverse phase hplc on a 50 ! 3 mm
aquasil c18 column (keystone), using a 0.1% tfa:
acetonitrile mobile phase (55:45, by volume) at a Ô¨Çow
rate of 0.4 ml/min, with ms/ms detection and quantitation. the limit of quantitation for a-381393 in brain
and plasma averaged 1 ng/g and 0.66 ng/ml, respectively.

2.7. pharmacokinetic studies
3. results
male spragueedawley rats (w 250 g; n z 3/group)
received a 1-mg/kg iv, sc or ip dose of a-381393. for
determination of brain concentrations, additional
groups of rats received a 0.1, 1 or 10 mmol/kg subcutaneous dose. the compound was prepared as
a solution in isotonic dextrose (d5w) containing 10%
ethanol at concentrations appropriate for a 1-ml/kg
dose volume in each treatment group. serial blood
samples were obtained from a tail vein of each rat for

3.1. receptor selectivity
a-381393 is highly selective for dopamine d4 receptors, binding with an aÔ¨Énity of 1.5 g 0.1 nm to the
cloned human dopamine d4.4 receptor (tables 1 and 2).
the selectivity of a-381393 was determined for more
than 70 diÔ¨Äerent neurotransmitter receptors and ion
channels (cerep, paris, france). those sites showing

dopamine receptors. compared to its aÔ¨Énity for the
 xxxg658xxx , a-381393 exhibited negligible
aÔ¨Énity (ki o 1 mm) for most of the receptors tested,
except  xxxg1113xxx  with ki of 370 nm. l-745870
selectively binds to  xxxg658xxx  (ki z 0.43 nm) over the
other dopamine receptors, but has moderate binding
aÔ¨Énity to serotonin 5-ht2a, sigma receptors, histamine
h1 and a-adenoceptors (patel et al., 1997). a-381393
has similar aÔ¨Énities for three major polymorphic d4
receptor variants examined, ki for d4.2, d4.4 and d4.7
are 1.9 nm, 1.5 nm and 1.6 nm, respectively (table 2).

speciÔ¨Åc binding !1 mm as well as binding to dopamine
receptors are shown in table 1. a-381393 had no aÔ¨Énity
(o10 mm) for adenosine (a1, a2a or a3), angiotensin
(at1,  xxxg101xxx ), b-adrenergic receptors, benzodiazepine,
 xxxg977xxx , ccr1,  xxxg564xxx , cgrp, cannabanoid (cb1

p2y), serotonin (5-ht3,  xxxg1118xxx ), somatostatin,  xxxg2296xxx , vip1, and vasopressin (v1a) receptors. a-381393
also did not bind to the norepinephine transporter or lc
type calcium, kc
v , skca, sodium or chloride channels.
receptor binding aÔ¨Énities of a-381393, l-745870 and
clozapine for various neurotransmitter receptors are
summarized in table 1. a-381393 binds to dopamine d4
receptor with nanomolar aÔ¨Énity (ki z 1.5 nm), which is
comparable with l-745870, and 36-fold higher than
clozapine (ki z 54 nm) (schmidt et al., 2001). a-381393
was more than 4000-fold selective for the dopamine d4
receptors as compared to dopamine d1, d2, d3 and d5
receptors. in contrast, clozapine was only 2.5- to 7-fold
selective for d4 receptors when compared to other

3.2. functional studies with calcium Ô¨Çux assays
we have previously shown that the dopamine d4
receptor and chimeric g-protein gaqo5 co-expressed in
hek cells are functionally coupled leading to robust
agonist-induced ca2c signal, which can be detected in
calcium Ô¨Çux assays (moreland et al., 2004a). to
investigate the functional activities of a-381393,
l-745870 and clozapine, the compounds were tested in
the human dopamine d4.4 receptor calcium Ô¨Çux assay.
a-381393, l-745870 and clozapine showed concentration-dependent inhibition of 1 mm dopamine response
in this assay with ic50s of 8, 33 and 1120 nm,
respectively (fig. 2a), indicating that a-381393 is
a potent d4 antagonist, the most potent among three.
a-381393 and clozapine did not exhibit any signiÔ¨Åcant
intrinsic activities up to 10 mm, whereas l-745870
showed partial agonist activity, up to 20% of dopamine
 xxxd1891xxx  mm (fig. 2b) (stewart et al., 2004). a-381393 had
no eÔ¨Äect on the dopamine response in human dopamine
d2l and  xxxg657xxx  calcium Ô¨Çux assays (fig. 3a and
b), but dose-dependently inhibited dopamine response
at the dopamine d4.4 receptor (fig. 3c), indicating the
functional selectivity of a-381393.

to determine brain penetration of a-381393 after
subcutaneous administration, a-381393 was administered to rats over a dose range of 0.1 mmol/kg to
10 mmol/kg s.c. (fig. 5). the amount of a-381393
present in plasma and brain samples at various time
points (5e60 min) was determined by hplc analysis.
increasing doses of a-381393 were reÔ¨Çected in corresponding increases in measured plasma and brain levels
of a-381393. the data demonstrated that plasma and
brain levels of a-381393 rose proportionally to the dose
of 1200 ng/ml plasma level and 500 ng/g brain level at
a dose of 10 mmol/kg s.c. and conÔ¨Årmed that a-381393
has signiÔ¨Åcant brain penetration. in the rat, within
30 min of subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration (1 mg/kg), a-381393 in the plasma reached to cmax
of 34.3 g 4.7 and 50.7 g 17.1 ng/ml, respectively. the
elimination half-life was calculated from 5 min to 1 h
time points of the i.v. proÔ¨Åle (plasma t1/2 z 18 g 6 min),
indicating that a-381393 is quickly metabolized in rats
(fig. 6).

3.5. rat penile erection assay
it has been demonstrated that the dopamine d4
receptor selective agonist pd168077 induces penile
erection in conscious rats by centrally mediated mechanisms with an eÔ¨Äective dose of 0.3 mmol/kg (hsieh
et al., 2004). to determine if a-381393 would attenuate
this eÔ¨Äect, the compound was dosed subcutaneously at
30 mmol/kg before administration of pd168077. when
the percent incidence of penile erection was examined,
pd168077 induced 75% incidence at the eÔ¨Écacious
dose. in animals treated with a-381393, this incidence
was signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced to 48% (fig. 7).

selectivity for the  xxxg658xxx  (o4000-fold)
compared to all other dopamine receptor subtypes,
which was comparable to l-745870 and markedly more
selective than clozapine. a-381393 had no or weak
aÔ¨Énity for a number of neurotransmitter receptors
tested (ki o 1 mm) although it had moderate aÔ¨Énity for
5ht2a (ki z 370 nm). l-745870 also has similar range
of aÔ¨Énities for 5ht2a (table 1). furthermore, unlike
a-381393, l-745870 has signiÔ¨Åcant aÔ¨Énities for sigma
receptors and a1 and a2 adrenergic receptors (patel
et al., 1997). as a whole, a-381393 showed comparable
receptor selectivities as pd89211 (pugsley et al., 2002) or
pnu101385g (merchant et al., 1996).
functional eÔ¨Écacy of a-381393 was investigated in
vitro using calcium Ô¨Çux assays and gtp-g-s binding in
human d4 transfected cells. in both assays, a-381393
potently reversed dopamine-mediated activation.
a-381393 did not exhibit any signiÔ¨Åcant intrinsic
activity in any of these assays. this is in contrast to
l-745870. it is diÔ¨Écult to compare in vitro assays for
pd89211 (mitogenesis assay vs. camp or calcium Ô¨Çux)
to determine if this compound lacks agonist activity
(pugsley et al., 2002). while a-381393 is not orally
bioavailable, it had good pharmacokinetic properties by
s.c. or i.p. administration in rat, and signiÔ¨Åcant brain
penetration in the rat (figs. 5, 6).
although clozapine has been used as one of the
atypical antipsychotic compounds of choice, the superior clinical proÔ¨Åle of clozapine is diÔ¨Écult to pinpoint to
a single pharmacological action because clozapine binds
with high aÔ¨Énity to many neurotransmitter receptors
(schmidt et al., 2001; wilson et al., 1998; wong and van
tol, 2003a). clozapine produces a range of biochemical
and behavioral eÔ¨Äects, including an increase of dopamine turnover in forebrain regions and an antagonism
of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity (karoum and
egan, 1992), associated with dopamine d2-like receptor
antagonism in the brain. the role of d2-like receptor
subtypes (d2, d3, d4) in mediating these behaviors has
not been conclusively demonstrated, but the identiÔ¨Åcation of the  xxxg658xxx  subtype (van tol
et al., 1991) led to speculations that clozapine may be
exerting its antipsychotic activity via dopamine d4
receptor antagonism.
the role of dopamine d4 receptors in normal
physiological function remains to be determined. the
high aÔ¨Énity of clozapine for this receptor and the
eÔ¨Écacy of clozapine as an atypical antipsychotic led to
the proposal of the  xxxg658xxx  played a key role in the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia (hrib, 2000; wong
and van tol, 2003a,b). however, the lack of eÔ¨Écacy of
d4 selective antagonists in human clinical trials including l-745870 (kramer et al., 1997; bristow et al.,
1997b) and the recent report of  xxxd3224xxx  has
compelled a re-examination of this hypothesis (corrigan
et al., 2004). activation of dopamine d4 receptors in the

119

brain induces penile erection in rats (brioni et al., 2004;
hsieh et al., 2004). pd168077 treatment results in an
increase in both c-fos expression and erk phosphorylation in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus in rats at doses that induce penile erection in rats
(bitner et al., 2004). the exact mechanisms of d4
receptor activation, signaling and potential involvement
of inter-neurons all remain to be explored. the role of
the  xxxg658xxx  in cognition, attention and
memory has been proposed based on gene deletion
studies as well as genetic studies in humans associating
the dopamine d4.7 receptor with attention deÔ¨Åcit
disorder (grady et al., 2003). dopamine d4 gene
deletions show an up-regulation of nmda and
dopamine d1 receptors as well as increased sensitivity
to amphetamine (gan et al., 2004; kruzich et al., 2004).
most interestingly, deletion of the d4 gene results in
a protection from the hyperactive phenotype observed in
6-hydroxydopamine treated animals (avale et al., 2004).
using 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats to induce
motor hyperactivity, it was found that both dopamine
d4-selective antagonists l-745870 and u-101958 dosedependently inhibited motor hyperactivity while a d4
agonist cp226269 increased it (zhang et al., 2001, 2002).
using  xxxg658xxx  gene deletions the  xxxg658xxx  has been shown to be necessary for
hyperactivity in this model (avale et al., 2004).
however, these studies are complicated by the supposed
partial agonist activity of both l-745870 and u-101958
(gazi et al., 1998, 1999). the development of dopamine
 xxxg658xxx  selective antagonists lacking agonist activity
would allow tools to investigate the role of dopamine d4
receptors in cns function.
recently, we have demonstrated that selective d4
agonist like abt-724 facilitates penile erection in rats
(brioni et al., 2004). the data shown here in fig. 7 will
be another supportive evidence that d4 receptors are
involved in the regulation of penile function in
mammals. the availability of a-381393, a highly
selective d4 antagonist without any intrinsic activity,
described here would have signiÔ¨Åcant advantages over
the existing d4 antagonists and can be an important tool
in the Ô¨Åeld.
