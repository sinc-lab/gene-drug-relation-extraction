synopsis

the vasoconstrictor activity of sumatriptan and ergotamine were compared by injecting these drugs in the hand vein of
migraine subjects. we used the "venotest method", which permits the evaluation of the venoconstrictor effect of small
doses of drugs, acting locally in the hand vein.
sumatriptan injected at increasing doses in the hand vein provoked contraction only at high doses (500 µg):
venoconstriction lasted 5-15 minutes and was similar in intensity and duration to that induced by 0.5-1 µg of
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht). likewise, ergotamine induced contraction only at a dose of 50 µg: this venoconstrictor
effect was long lasting (at least i hour). ergotamine-induced hand vein contraction, almost completely inhibited by
 xxxd2419xxx , seems mediated at least in part by 5-ht2 receptors, like the one induced by 5-ht and sumatriptan, already
observed in a previous study.
clinical doses of ergotamine (0.25 mg intramuscular) and of sumatriptan (6 mg subcutaneous) do not provoke hand vein
contraction for at least i hour: this could be due to a low activity of these drugs on the 5-ht2 vein receptors or a
technique that is unsuitable to detect the vasoconstrictor effect of drugs given by the systemic route.
the long lasting venoconstrictor effect of ergotamine may be due to a slow dissociation from receptor sites. the short
vasoconstriction induced by sumatriptan could account for the recurrence of headache in many sumatriptan-treated
migraine subjects.

introduction

sumatriptan, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) agonist, was claimed to be more effective than ergotamine in migraine attacks.1 it was
thought that ergotamine and sumatriptan aborted migraine attacks by a vasoconstrictor action in the cranial circulation, but their
actual anti-migraine mechanism is still debated.2-5 it was reported that unlike ergotamine, sumatriptan does not seem to have a
significant vasoconstrictor effect on peripheral arteries in man.6 this depends on its selective agonist action on 5-ht1 receptors,
which mediates 5-ht vasoconstriction chiefly within the cranial circulation.4 although ergotamine is rather selective in the
constriction of extracerebral cranial arteries,7 signs of prolonged constriction of extracranial arteries appear when clinical doses
are administered.8 the vascular effects of ergotamine may be mediated by 5-ht, alpha-adrenergic and, perhaps, yet unknown
receptors.7,9 the peripheral vasoconstrictor action of ergotamine is likely to be mediated through the stimulation of 5-ht
receptors, particularly the 5-ht2 receptors, as evidenced by dihydroergotamine.10
the aim of this study was to compare the vasoconstrictor effect of sumatriptan and ergotamine on a peripheral vein of
migraineurs.
methods
the study was performed by the "venotest method", a technique that utilizes the hand vein as a substrate.11 this method permits
one to evaluate the venoconstrictor activity of some neurotransmitters (5-ht, noradrenaline) in small doses (0.25-2 µg given as a
bolus), acting only locally in the hand vein, as a sort of "isolated organ in vivo".
briefly, a 0.8 mm caliber needle provided with a rubber membrane (olovson needle) was orthodromically inserted into the vein in
the direction of blood flow. the needle was connected by a teflon tube to an electric pump and a strain gauge. in order to keep
blood from flowing into the needle, the pump infused saline at a constant speed (0.5 ml/min). vasoconstrictor agents, when
injected through the rubber membrane, provoked an increase in local vein pressure due to downstream venoconstriction. the
signal of the strain gauge, amplified 15 times and integrated, was recorded. venoconstriction was recorded conventionally in
venoconstriction units (vcu), and 1 vcu indicates an increase of 1 mmhg for i second.
the study was performed on 20 female normotensive patients (aged 25-52) with a diagnosis of migraine without aura according to
the international headache society classification

criteria.12 they were informed about the purpose and risk of the procedure used and gave their consent. all subjects were
drug-free for at least seven days prior to the study.
after taking 15 minutes to allow the vein pressure to become stable, increasing doses of sumatriptan (1-10-50-100-500 µg) or
ergotamine (1-5-10-50 µg), dissolved in 0.5 ml of saline solution were injected in the hand vein as a bolus,  xxxd1891xxx  minute
intervals, until a clear venoconstrictor effect appeared. in addition the venoconstrictor effect of clinical parenteral doses of
sumatriptan (6 mg subcutaneous) or ergotamine (0.25 mg intramuscular) was evaluated for a period of one hour. since the
5-ht and sumatriptan-induced hand vein contraction was inhibited by the 5-ht2 antagonist  xxxd2419xxx ,13,14 the action of
 xxxd2419xxx  on the ergotamine venoconstriction was also tested. each test was performed between 0900 and 1200 h.
the following drugs were used: sumatriptan 6 mg/0.5 ml (imigran, glaxo),  xxxd2022xxx  0.25 mg/ml ( xxxd2022xxx ,
sandoz),  xxxd2419xxx  5 mg/ml ( xxxd2419xxx , janssen).
results

sumatriptan (6 mg subcutaneous) and ergotamine (0.25 mg intramuscular) do not provoke venoconstriction in the hand vein
for at least one hour (n=5, for each).
when injected in the hand vein, sumatriptan provokes venoconstrictor effects only at 500 µg dose (n=5). in all subjects
venoconstriction ended within 5-15 minutes; its intensity and duration were similar to that induced by 0.5-1 µg of 5-ht, as
observed in a previous study.13 conversely, ergotamine provoked venoconstriction only at 50 µg doses (n=5). the
venoconstriction induced by ergotamine was long lasting in all subjects and it did not decrease for at least one hour (figure
1). in addition, venoconstrictive doses of ergotamine or sumatriptan (50 and 500 µg, respectively) injected in the hand vein
contralateral to the one of the test, provoke no venoconstriction in the tested vein.
it is difficult to compare the intensity of the venoconstrictive effect of sumatriptan and ergotamine. in fact by this method
venoconstriction intensity is calculated by using the integral of the vein pressure increase related to the duration (that is the
"area under the curve") measured in vcu. but then such a comparison is meaningless for the very different venoconstriction
duration induced by these drugs. however regarding the increase in vein pressure, sumatriptan 500 µg provoked a maximum
increase of 4-5 mmhg, while ergotamine induced a similar increase in two subjects (see figure i) but a higher one in three
other subjects, well over the highest recording level (see figure 2) and maintained for not less than an hour.
 xxxd2419xxx  (50 µg as a bolus) injected in the test hand vein two minutes prior to ergotamine (50 µg), inhibited, almost
completely, ergotamine induced venoconstriction in 5 subjects: the increase in vein pressure did not exceed 1-2 mmhg. a
comparison was made between the response to 50 µg of ergo-

tamine obtained in the same subjects, on different days. in two of the cases tested even minor doses of  xxxd2419xxx  (10 mµ)
were able to provoke a clear reduction of ergotamine induced venoconstriction (figure 2).

discussion

sumatriptan, contrary to ergotamine, was not initially reported to have significant vasoconstrictive effect on peripheral arteries
in man.6 however studies in vitro,15,16 and in vivo with clinical subcutaneous doses,17,18 show that sumatriptan has some
vasoconstrictive activity on peripheral arteries. in our study the parenteral administration of sumatriptan (6 mg subcutaneous)
or ergotamine (0.25 mg intramuscular) provoked no venoconstriction of the hand vein.
when sumatriptan and ergotamine were injected locally in the hand vein, they showed a venoconstrictor effect only at
relatively high doses, providing surely higher levels of the drug in the hand vein than those obtained by the systemic
administration of clinical doses. this was also shown by the fact that the injection of the same venoconstrictive doses of
sumatriptan and ergotamine into a hand vein contralateral to the test vessel did not provoke venoconstriction in the tested
hand vein. the injection of sumatriptan 500 µg in the hand vein provoked a contraction comparable for its intensity and
duration to the one induced by 0.5-1 µg of 5-ht already observed in a prior study.13 this is consistent with the fact that
sumatriptan and 5-ht have a very similar molecular structure. the sumatriptan hand vein contraction was completely inhibited
by low doses of  xxxd2419xxx , a 5-ht2 antagonist, indicating an action of the high doses of sumatriptan on the 5-ht2
receptors.13 in fact the 5-ht contraction of the hand vein is mediated by the 5-ht2 receptors.14,19,20 ergotamine is not as
effective as 5-ht, but more than sumatriptan, in provoking hand vein contraction. unlike the venoconstriction induced by
5-ht and sumatriptan, that induced by ergotamine is long lasting.
a long lasting contraction of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine has been reported even in isolated human temporal arteries
and in peripheral arteries and veins in vivo.21-23 our study seems to show that the hand vein contraction induced by
ergotamine like that induced by 5-ht and sumatriptan,13,14 is mediated to some extent by the 5-ht2 receptors, since it is
almost completely inhibited by  xxxd2419xxx .
the fact that systemic administration of clinical doses of sumatriptan (subcutaneous) and ergotamine (intramuscular) does not
apparently provoke contraction of the hand vein could be due to the low activity of these drugs on the 5-ht2 vein receptors.
however the technique we used may not be suitable to detect the venoconstrictive effect of drugs given by the systemic route.
in spite of these results, the most interesting observation is that ergotamine provoked a longer lasting contraction of the hand
vein than sumatriptan. this is consistent with a previous study showing that the sumatriptan induced contraction of peripheral
arteries in man lasts less than two hours, while the one induced by ergotamine lasts eight hours at least.17 the prolonged
vasoconstrictive effect of ergotamine, that seems to be a characteristic of ergot-peptide alkaloids,8,10,23 could be due to an
extremely slow dissociation from the receptor sites, as previously suggested for dihydroergotamine.10 a high rate
(approximately 40 percent) of headache recurrence was reported after sumatriptan treatment of migraine attacks, owing
perhaps to the short half-life of the drug;24,25 an enhanced frequency of cluster headache attacks in one third of the patients
during sumatriptan treatment was also observed.26 ergotamine and dihydroergotamine showed a minor rate of headache
relapse.1,27,28 we believe that such recurrent headache might be caused by a shorter receptor ligand binding of
sumatriptan than of ergotamine, though we cannot state whether this difference is in the cranial blood vessels or at a central
neuronal level.
