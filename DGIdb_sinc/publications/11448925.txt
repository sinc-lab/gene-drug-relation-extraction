abstract
the statin family of drugs inhibits  xxxd32xxx  (hmg-coa) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, and is used clinically as a
safe and effective approach in the control of hypercholesterolemia. we have shown previously (dimitroulakos, j., nohynek, d., backway, k. l., hedley, d. w., yeger, h., freedman, m. h., minden, m d., and penn, l. z. increased
sensitivity of acute myelogenous leukemias to lovastatininduced apoptosis: a potential therapeutic approach. blood,

of the statin family, can induce apoptosis of human acute
myeloid leukemia (aml) cells in a sensitive and specific
manner. in the present study, we evaluated the relative
potency and mechanism of action of the newer synthetic
statins, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and  xxxd461xxx , to trigger
tumor-specific apoptosis.  xxxd461xxx  is at least 10 times
more potent than the other statins at inducing apoptosis in
aml cell lines.  xxxd461xxx -induced apoptosis is reversible
with the addition of the immediate product of the hmgcoa reductase reaction, mevalonate, or with a distal product of the pathway,  xxxd578xxx . this
suggests protein geranylgeranylation is an essential downstream component of the mevalonate pathway for  xxxd461xxx  similar to lovastatin-induced apoptosis. the enhanced
potency of  xxxd461xxx  expands the number of aml patient

samples as well as the types of malignancies, which respond
to statin-induced apoptosis with acute sensitivity. cells derived from acute lymphocytic leukemia are only weakly
sensitive to lovastatin cytotoxicity but show robust response
to  xxxd461xxx . importantly,  xxxd461xxx  is not cytotoxic to
nontransformed human bone marrow progenitors. these
results strongly support the further testing of  xxxd461xxx  as
a novel anticancer therapeutic alone and in combination
with other agents in vivo.

introduction
the statin family of drugs targets hmg-coa6 reductase,
the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway (1). the
statin drugs are currently used widely as a safe and effective
therapeutic in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia (2). we
have reported previously (3) that one member of the statin
family, lovastatin, triggers apoptosis in established and primary
aml cells but not in normal bone marrow progenitors at doses
that are achievable in vivo. further support for the use of statins
as a novel therapeutic in the treatment of cancer has been shown
in retrospective studies (4) of statin trials where the incidence of
cancer is decreased 28% in patients prescribed  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitor therapy compared with those prescribed bile
acids. hence, the statin family may be a potential immediate
therapeutic for the treatment of aml as well as other sensitive
tumor types.
the statin family is composed of six members: pravastatin,
simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and  xxxd461xxx . the first three are derived from fungal fermentation,
whereas the latter three are synthetic (2). each member differs
in its specificity for  xxxg1060xxx , purity, prodrug or
active administrative form, and metabolism (5, 6). the fungalderived agents have been shown to possess similar antiproliferative properties on aml-derived cells (3, 7, 8); however, the
sensitivity and specificity of the synthetic statins to trigger
aml-specific apoptosis remain unclear. identifying the statin
with maximal efficacy and specific activity will have direct
impact on the clinical application of statin therapy in the management of cancer.
in this study, we compare the potency of the synthetic statins
(fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and  xxxd461xxx ) to lovastatin (fig. 1) for
their ability to inhibit aml cell viability. moreover, we explore

2068  xxxd461xxx -induced apoptosis

fig. 1 schematic diagram
showing the structure of the
statins under investigation in
this study. lovastatin is one of
the prototypic inhibitors of
 xxxg1060xxx  and is derived from fungal fermentation,
whereas atorvastatin,  xxxd461xxx , and fluvastatin are newer
synthetic inhibitors of this ratelimiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway.

and compare the mechanism of action of lovastatin with the most
potent statin,  xxxd461xxx . we also determine that the increase in
potency of  xxxd461xxx  to trigger apoptosis results in a greater
number of statin-sensitive aml patient samples, expands the spectrum of tumors sensitive to statin therapy, and, importantly, retains
tumor specificity.

materials and methods
cells and cell culture conditions. aml cell lines
oci-aml-2, oci-aml-3, oci-aml-5 (hereafter referred to
as aml-2, aml-3, and aml-5, respectively) and nb-4 and
primary aml patient cells were all obtained from the ontario
cancer institute leukemia tissue bank. the all cell lines b1,
c1, and kk were derived as described previously (9) and
obtained from dr. m. freedman (the hospital for sick children, toronto, ontario, canada). cell lines were cultured in
␣-mem (princess margaret hospital media service, toronto,
ontario, canada), supplemented with 10% fbs and penicillin/
streptomycin. media for aml-5 cells was supplemented with
10% 5637 conditioned media.
frozen patient cells were thawed and equilibrated overnight in ␣-mem supplemented with 30% fbs, 10% 5637
conditioned media, and penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified
incubator at 37°c and 5% co2. the next day, the concentration
of fbs in the media was decreased to 20% for subsequent
assays. mononucleated cells were isolated from normal bone
marrow using  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque and t-cell depleted. peripheral

blood blasts from presenting and relapsed patients and normal
bone marrow from bone marrow transplant donors were collected after informed consent, according to institutional guidelines.
for dose-response experiments, cell lines and patient and
normal bone marrow cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of statin (0 ␮m to 100 ␮m) for 48 h in a humidified
incubator at 37°c and 5% co2. as solvent controls, ethanol and
methanol were used for lovastatin and atorvastatin, respectively,
whereas pbs was used for fluvastatin and  xxxd461xxx . for the
add-back experiments, cell lines were coincubated for 48 h with
1 ␮m  xxxd461xxx  and increasing concentrations of squalene (0
␮m to 200 ␮m), mevalonate (0 ␮m to 300 ␮m),  xxxd578xxx  (0 ␮m to
10 ␮m), or fpp (0 ␮m to 10 ␮m).
the statins used in this study were kindly provided by their
respective manufacturer. lovastatin powder was a gift of apotex corp. (mississauga, ontario, canada) and was activated as
described previously (3, 10).  xxxd461xxx  powder was a gift
from bayer inc. (wuppertal, germany). fluvastatin and atorvastatin powder were contributed by novartis (basel, switzerland) and parke-davis (ann arbor, mi), respectively, and resuspended according to manufacturers’ instructions. mtt,
avidin-fitc, squalene,  xxxd578xxx , and fpp were purchased from
sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo).

described in our previous manuscript (3). apoptosis was determined using the tunel assay. for the tunel assay, the cells
were exposed to drug for 48 h, harvested, and fixed by incubation in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min on ice. subsequently, the
cells were centrifuged, washed, resuspended in 70% ethanol,
and stored at ⫺20°c for up to 1 week. for analysis, 106 cells
were incubated with 0.02 mm biotin-dutp and 12.5 units of
 xxxg647xxx  enzyme in a 1⫻ reaction
buffer [200 mm potassium cacodylate, 25 mm tris-hcl, and 25
␮g/ml bsa (ph 6.6)], 2.5 mm cocl2, and 0.01 mm dttp
(roche molecular biochemicals, laval, quebec, canada) for 45
min at 37°c. the cells were then washed once with pbs, labeled
with avidin-fitc for 60 min at room temperature, washed
again, and analyzed using a facscalibur cytometer (becton
dickinson, san jose, ca).

results
aml-derived cell lines show an increased sensitivity
to  xxxd461xxx . to compare the sensitivity of aml cells to
undergo apoptosis in response to lovastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and  xxxd461xxx , we first used the mtt assay. mtt is a
measure of the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity within the
cell and provides an indication of the proliferation status of the cells
(11). the aml cell lines aml-2, aml-3, aml-5, and nb-4
were exposed to each statin over a wide concentration range (0
␮m-100 ␮m) for 48 h. the mtt assay was then conducted, and the

resulting absorbance values were normalized to untreated controls
(fig. 2). representative mtt assays comparing the four statins in
each cell line are shown in fig. 2. of the four statins tested, the
aml cell lines were most sensitive to  xxxd461xxx , followed by
fluvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin, as shown by the decrease in
the mtt activity. a comparison of the mtt50s obtained for each
cell line demonstrated that  xxxd461xxx  was the most potent statin
tested in this assay (fig. 2e).
 xxxd461xxx  induces apoptosis by a similar mechanism to lovastatin. we further examined the growth-inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of  xxxd461xxx  for mechanism of
action. to ascertain whether the decrease in mtt activity in
response to  xxxd461xxx  was attributable to the induction of
apoptotic cell death, as seen previously (3) with lovastatin, we
assayed the cells using the tunel assay. the tunel assay
detects the dna strand breaks induced during the process of
apoptosis (12).  xxxd461xxx  does indeed induce apoptosis in
aml cells, as shown in the representative tunel profile (fig.
3). the percentage of apoptotic cells is shown above the
tunel-positive cells. aml-3 cells were exposed for 48 h to
doses of lovastatin and  xxxd461xxx , which reduced the mtt
activity to approximately 10% compared with control. the
ethanol control induced 2.3% apoptotic death, whereas 20 ␮m
lovastatin induced 57.0% apoptotic death (fig. 3, a and b,
respectively). the pbs control for  xxxd461xxx  induced 2.6%
apoptotic death, whereas 1 ␮m  xxxd461xxx , a 20-fold lower

concentration than lovastatin, induced 64.6% apoptotic death
(fig. 3, c and d, respectively).  xxxd461xxx  similarly induced
elevated apoptotic death of aml-2, aml-5, and nb-4 cells,
despite the concentration being 20-fold less than lovastatin (data
not shown).
we have shown previously (10) that the inhibition of protein
isoprenylation, in particular geranylgeranylation, holds a critical
role in the mechanism of lovastatin-induced apoptosis in aml
cells. to determine whether the mechanism of  xxxd461xxx -induced
apoptosis in aml cells was similar to lovastatin-induced apoptosis,
we implemented an add-back approach to determine which products of the mevalonate pathway were critical to  xxxd461xxx -induced apoptosis. cells were coincubated with 1 ␮m  xxxd461xxx  and
a range of concentrations of either mevalonate, squalene,  xxxd578xxx , or
fpp for 48 h and then assayed for indications of proliferation by the
mtt assay (fig. 4). the addition of mevalonate at 100 ␮m completely reversed the effect of 1 ␮m  xxxd461xxx  (fig. 4a). squalene,
an intermediate in the cholesterol pathway, was added to the media
at concentrations from 10 ␮m to 200 ␮m. no inhibition of  xxxd461xxx -induced cytotoxicity was seen in any of the four aml cell
lines with the addition of squalene (fig. 4b). the addition of  xxxd578xxx 
reversed the cytotoxic effects of 1 ␮m  xxxd461xxx  with a maximum
effect (approximately 90% of control) at approximately 3 ␮m (fig.
4c). the addition of fpp only partially reversed the effects of 1 ␮m
 xxxd461xxx  with a maximum effect (approximately 20% of control)
at a dose of approximately 2.5 ␮m (fig. 4d). hence, the mechanism of  xxxd461xxx -induced apoptosis is similar to that of lovastatin, as reported previously (10).
primary aml patient samples which weakly respond to lovastatin-induced apoptosis are sensitive to  xxxd461xxx -induced apoptosis. after observing the increased
sensitivity of aml cell lines to  xxxd461xxx  relative to lovasta-

tin, we wished to determine whether this increase in sensitivity
was evident with primary aml patient material. we evaluated
primary aml samples by the mtt and tunel assays after
exposure for 48 h to various concentrations of  xxxd461xxx . first,
we examined whether patient material, which had been determined previously (3) as nonresponsive to lovastatin, would be
sensitive or insensitive to  xxxd461xxx . aml patient samples
were defined previously (3) as nonresponsive when the mtt50
and mtt30 were greater than 100 ␮m. analysis of two nonresponsive aml patient samples showed that neither patient
sample was sensitive to lovastatin or  xxxd461xxx  (fig. 5a). the
mtt activity in both cases decreased to approximately 60 –
70%. our previous work (3) indicates that a decrease in mtt
activity similar to fig. 5a corresponds to a nonapoptotic response. indeed, analysis by the tunel assay revealed apoptosis did not occur when the patient cells were exposed to 150 ␮m
lovastatin or 20 ␮m  xxxd461xxx  for 48 h (data not shown).
to determine whether aml patient samples that showed a
weak response to lovastatin would respond to  xxxd461xxx  with
an increase in sensitivity, we exposed aml patient samples that
exhibited a weak response to lovastatin to  xxxd461xxx  for 48 h.
the aml patient samples were then assayed by the mtt and
tunel method. a weak response was defined previously (3) as
samples with an mtt50 less than 100 ␮m and an mtt30
greater than 100 ␮m, whereas primary patient samples with both
mtt50 and mtt30 values less than 100 ␮m were considered
sensitive. using the mtt assay, primary aml patient samples,
which were weakly responsive to lovastatin, were significantly
more sensitive to  xxxd461xxx  (fig. 5b). comparative analysis
demonstrates that the mtt50 concentrations for patient samples
exposed to  xxxd461xxx  were at least 10 times lower than the
mtt50 concentrations for the same patient samples exposed to

fig. 4  xxxd461xxx -induced apoptosis of aml cells is inhibited
by mevalonate or  xxxd578xxx . cells
were exposed to 1 ␮m  xxxd461xxx  and increasing concentrations

 xxxd578xxx ; or d, fpp for 48 h. mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity was determined using the

lovastatin. this was a statistically significant difference (p ⬍
0.01, using a paired t test; fig. 5c). similarly, when primary
aml patient cells (patient d) were exposed to 100 ␮m lovastatin for 48 h, only 9.1% apoptotic death was detected by the
tunel assay. by contrast, when the same primary aml patient cells were exposed to a 10-fold lower concentration of
 xxxd461xxx  (10 ␮m), 24.8% apoptotic death was detected (fig.
5d). thus, a patient sample that is weakly responsive to lovastatin-induced apoptosis can be sensitive to the apoptotic effects
of  xxxd461xxx , whereas nonresponsive patient cells remain
apoptosis-resistant across a large dose range of either lovastatin
or  xxxd461xxx .
all cell lines, weakly responsive to lovastatin, are
sensitive to  xxxd461xxx . the increased potency of  xxxd461xxx  suggested that the range of hematological malignancies sensitive to statin-induced apoptosis may be expanded.
previously (3), we showed that acute lymphocytic leukemic
(all) cell lines were only weakly responsive to lovastatininduced apoptosis. to determine whether the all cell lines
may be sensitive to  xxxd461xxx -induced apoptosis, we compared the response of three all cell lines (b1, c1, and kk)
with a wide concentration range of lovastatin and  xxxd461xxx 
using the mtt assay. by this screening approach, the all
cell lines were more sensitive to  xxxd461xxx  (data not
shown). using the tunel assay, we determined that a
greater number of all cells was indeed dying by apoptosis
after 48 h exposure to  xxxd461xxx  compared with lovastatin
at 20 ␮m, the dose at which we had shown previously (3)

all cell lines lacked a significant apoptotic response. representative tunel profiles of c1 cells after exposure to
ethanol control, 20 ␮m lovastatin, pbs control, or 20 ␮m
 xxxd461xxx  for 48 h are shown in fig. 6a. after exposure to
lovastatin for 48 h, the percentage of apoptotic cells was
6.9%, 4.4%, and 2.4% for b1, c1, and kk, respectively,
compared with ethanol controls, 4.1%, 2.1%, and 2.4%, respectively (fig. 6b). by contrast, exposure at the same concentration of  xxxd461xxx  induced 20.2%, 53.1%, and 20.1%
apoptotic death in b1, c1, and kk cells, respectively, compared with pbs controls at 5.0%, 3.8% and 2.7%, respectively (fig. 6b).
 xxxd461xxx  triggers tumor-specific apoptosis. the
work of ourselves and others (3, 7, 8) has shown that hmg-coa
reductase inhibitors such as lovastatin have negligible effects on
normal bone marrow progenitors and hematopoiesis. it remained unclear whether the elevated potency of  xxxd461xxx  to
trigger tumor cell apoptosis would have an effect on normal
bone marrow progenitors. to this end, we exposed normal bone
marrow to lovastatin and  xxxd461xxx  at a range of concentrations. the normal bone marrow were then assayed using the
mtt, colony growth, and tunel assays. after 48 h exposure
to high concentrations (200 ␮m) of  xxxd461xxx , normal bone
marrow mtt activity was reduced to only 50% and was comparable with the effect of lovastatin (fig. 7a). to determine the
potential of progenitor cells to repopulate the hematopoietic
system after exposure to  xxxd461xxx  for 48 h, the colony growth
assay was used (13, 14). the normal bone marrow was exposed

colony formation of myeloid progenitor cells was comparable
after exposure to solvent controls, 20 ␮m lovastatin, or 20 ␮m
 xxxd461xxx  was seen (fig. 7b). the tunel assay further
revealed that after exposure to the doses used in the colony
growth assay, 8.9% apoptotic death in normal bone marrow
after exposure to 20 ␮m lovastatin and 1 ␮m  xxxd461xxx  compared with ethanol and pbs controls at 6.8% and 5.1% (fig.
7c). we determined that the effect of  xxxd461xxx  on normal
bone marrow was negligible and similar to lovastatin.

discussion
the statin family of drugs inhibits the mevalonate pathway
by targeting  xxxg1060xxx  and is the drug of choice for
treating hypercholesterolemia. we and others have shown previously (3, 8, 15–17) that statins can trigger tumor cells derived
from certain cancers, including aml, to undergo apoptosis in
vitro and reduce tumor load in vivo, suggesting statins may hold
a role as a novel therapeutic in the clinical management of
cancer. to fully evaluate the safety and efficacy of statins in
anticancer clinical trials, it is difficult to know which of the
many statins will be the drug of choice. to this end, we set out
to determine which statin shows the highest specific activity to
trigger tumor-specific cell death in vitro. in this study, we
compared the most recent generations of synthetic statins, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and  xxxd461xxx , to one of the original

fungal-derived statins used in our previous studies, lovastatin.
we showed that all of the four statins were cytotoxic to aml
cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.  xxxd461xxx  consistently
showed at least a 10-fold higher efficacy in triggering aml cell
death compared with the other statins. mechanistically, we show
 xxxd461xxx  killed aml cells in a similar manner to lovastatin.
cell death occurred by an apoptotic mechanism and was
blocked by mevalonate, the immediate downstream product of
 xxxg1060xxx , as well as an end product of the pathway,
 xxxd578xxx . importantly, we also show the specificity of the apoptotic response is restricted to transformed cells because normal
bone marrow progenitors were refractory to  xxxd461xxx  as well
as lovastatin-induced death. moreover, we show the elevated
efficacy of  xxxd461xxx -induced apoptosis increases both the
number and type of malignancies that are sensitive to statin
cytotoxicity.
our previous analysis (3) of primary aml patient samples
showed the majority was sensitive to lovastatin-induced apoptosis. however, two patient aml samples were nonresponsive
to lovastatin exposure. despite the increased efficacy of  xxxd461xxx , these two samples remain refractory to apoptosis induction. this data further reinforces that both  xxxd461xxx  and
lovastatin use a similar mechanism of action. moreover, this
shows that mechanisms of drug resistance to statin cytotoxicity
exist and that these may not necessarily be overcome by the
increased potency afforded by  xxxd461xxx . interestingly, in our
previous study (3) of aml patient samples, a subset was only

weakly sensitive to lovastatin and exhibited an apoptotic response only after prolonged exposure or after treatment with
elevated nonphysiological doses of drug. by contrast, exposure
to  xxxd461xxx  revealed these weakly sensitive aml patient
cells could be killed more rapidly and at a lower dose, suggesting these additional patients may be sensitive to the anticancer
therapeutic potential of  xxxd461xxx . as well as increasing the
number of sensitive aml patient samples, the elevated efficacy
of  xxxd461xxx  has similarly enabled additional hematological
malignancies to be included in the growing list of statin-sensitive tumor types. cell lines derived from all patients were
shown previously (3) to be only weakly sensitive to lovastatininduced apoptosis, requiring exposure to doses of 20 ␮m for
approximately 4 days to detect a cytotoxic response. by contrast, exposure to  xxxd461xxx  shows all cell lines can undergo
apoptosis in a sensitive manner in vitro. these results indicate:
(a) a larger number of patients may respond to  xxxd461xxx 
treatment; and (b) the range of tumor types sensitive to statin
therapy may be expanded with the use of  xxxd461xxx . it will be
informative to extend these observations and determine the
other tumor types that are sensitive to  xxxd461xxx -induced
apoptosis. it will likely include and extend the list of tumor
types we and others have shown previously (18 –22) to be
sensitive to lovastatin. this information will be instructive for
the design of clinical trials to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of
 xxxd461xxx  as an anticancer agent.
the wealth of data available from the extended use of
statins in the control of cholesterol also suggests  xxxd461xxx  is
the statin of choice for the cancer clinic. like other statins,

 xxxd461xxx  has been shown to have negligible adverse side
effects at the therapeutic dose for cholesterol. the maximum
dose of  xxxd461xxx  reported to date is 0.8 mg/day for a 4-week
trial with adverse effects being no greater than placebo control
(23, 24). contraindications for the statins are few (rash, nausea,
fever, myopathy, and liver toxicity) but are dose-related and can
be avoided by monitoring transaminase and creatine kinase
levels, since elevation in these enzymes has been associated
with adverse side effects (24, 25). importantly, clinical experience shows any adverse side effects are reversible when statin
administration is terminated, further emphasizing the relative
safety of these agents as a novel therapeutic for the cancer clinic.
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd461xxx  is far superior to that of
lovastatin, further suggesting it is the agent of choice for future
antitumor therapeutic studies. first,  xxxd461xxx  is enantiomerically pure and is in an active ␤-hydroxy acid form, whereas
lovastatin is administered as a lactone prodrug form and is
dependent upon first-pass metabolism for activation (26 –28).
comparative bioavailability of  xxxd461xxx  is 60%, whereas
lovastatin is approximately 5% (5, 29). in addition, unlike all of
the other statins,  xxxd461xxx  possesses high systemic bioavailability attributable to little first-pass extraction. moreover, there
is extensive patient-to-patient variability in lovastatin metabolism because it is dependent upon the activity of cytochrome
p450 3a4, which is commonly affected by other drugs and food
intake (5, 30). by contrast,  xxxd461xxx  biotransformation is
processed by two independent enzymes,  xxxg586xxx 
as well as 3a4 (26, 29, 31). indeed,  xxxd461xxx  metabolism is
not influenced by  xxxd461xxx , warfarin, antacid, cimetidine, cho-

2074  xxxd461xxx -induced apoptosis

fig. 7 normal bone marrow cells are not sensitive to  xxxd461xxx -induced apoptosis. sensitivity to  xxxd461xxx  was tested by the mtt assay (a),
colony growth assay (b), and the tunel assay (c). to assess possible antiproliferative effects over a broad dose range, cells were exposed to 0.01
to 200 ␮m lovastatin and  xxxd461xxx  for 48 h and analyzed for mtt activity. to evaluate sensitivity of progenitors, cells were plated in
 xxxd2609xxx  after 48 h of exposure to ethanol control, 20 ␮m lovastatin, pbs control, 1 ␮m, 5 ␮m, or 20 ␮m  xxxd461xxx  and incubated for 14
days. to measure apoptosis, cells were incubated with ethanol control, 20 ␮m lovastatin, pbs control, or 1 ␮m  xxxd461xxx  for 48 h, and induction
of apoptosis was determined by the tunel assay. shown are representative results of three independent mtt, colony growth, and tunel assay
experiments.

lestyramine, erythromycin, or digoxin, which can influence the
efficacy and safety of other statins when used in combination
therapy for hyperlipidemia (26, 32–35). that  xxxd461xxx  is less
subject to drug-drug interactions further strengthens its potential
role as an antitumor agent since cancer therapy is often administered as a cocktail of agents.
it will be of interest to determine whether  xxxd461xxx  will
synergize with other aml chemotherapeutics, as has been
shown previously for lovastatin; e.g., feleszko et al. (36) have
shown synergy between lovastatin and doxorubicin in mouse
tumor models.  xxxd461xxx  will likely exhibit similar synergistic
effects as lovastatin, as we have shown these two agents share
a similar mechanism of action. indeed, understanding the mechanism of action of statin-induced apoptosis has two immediate
clinical applications. first, synergistic interactions between
statins and different therapeutic options can be better predicted
because statins appear to trigger apoptosis by blocking isoprenylation of proteins by depleting  xxxd578xxx  pools. second, geranylgeranylation of protein substrates can be used as an in vivo
biomarker of statin activity in patient tumor samples during
clinical trials to determine whether the drug is directly affecting
the target cell by the proposed mechanism. it will be important
to determine the maximum tolerated dose of lovastatin and
 xxxd461xxx  and then determine whether these agents can affect

tumor load. our experience to date suggests there is a role for
statins in the management of cancer, since we reported recently
(17) a case study of aml blasts controlled by lovastatin in an
elderly aml patient.
clearly, statins can do more than simply lower cholesterol.
our studies suggest the statin family of drugs should be evaluated for their safety and efficacy alone and in combination with
other agents as a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of
cancer. we suggest certain cancers are more sensitive than
others to statin therapy (3, 22) and that the clinical and pharmacological characteristics of  xxxd461xxx  make  xxxd461xxx  the
statin of choice for this new application. the safety profile of
this family of drugs and the fact that they are readily available
simplify the testing of these drugs in the clinical management of
cancer.
