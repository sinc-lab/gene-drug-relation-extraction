 xxxd2450xxx  for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis and autoimmunity
suzanne sanders, md; valee harisdangkul, md, phd

abstract:  xxxd2450xxx , a new oral immunomodulatory agent, is effective for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis. its mechanism of action in suppressing inflammation is based in its inhibition of  xxxg633xxx , an enzyme responsible for de novo synthesis
of pyrimidine containing ribonucleotides. it is the first
disease-modifying antirheumatic drug approved for
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with an indication for
retardation of joint damage by radiography. side effects
are generally mild and include diarrhea, rashes, revers-

ible alopecia, and elevation of hepatic transaminases.
despite the concern about hepatotoxicity, combination
use with methotrexate in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis has been shown to be safe. other autoimmune diseases in which  xxxd2450xxx  has been used
successfully include felty syndrome, vasculitis, sjogren
syndrome, wegener granulomatosis, and bullous
pemphigoid. key indexing terms:  xxxd2450xxx ;
rheumatoid arthritis; autoimmunity. [am j med sci

mide results in decreased pyrimidine nucleotide
pools, thereby inducing cell-cycle arrest and inhibition of lymphocyte clonal expansion in patients with
ra.5 the effect of  xxxd2450xxx ’s active metabolite,
a77-1726, is cytostatic, without apoptosis, and is
reversible.4,5 resting lymphocytes and other proliferative cell types, such as hematopoietic cells, gastrointestinal lining cells, and bladder-lining cells
require less increase of pyrimidine ribonucleotide
pools and can meet dna synthesis requirements
through the salvage pathway and are therefore not
effected by  xxxd2450xxx .6 unlike other drugs that
inhibit nucleotide synthesis, such as 5-fluorouracil,
 xxxd1790xxx , or cyclophosphamide,7  xxxd2450xxx  administration has not been associated with
increase in opportunistic infections, bone marrow
toxicity, or mucositis.
 xxxd2450xxx  is absorbed and rapidly converted to
a77-1726; peak levels occur between 6 and 12 hours.
the sites of metabolism are thought to be the intestinal wall and liver.  xxxd2450xxx  is 80% bioavailable
and high-fat meals do not interfere with absorption.
a loading dose of 100 mg daily for 3 days is used to
attain a more rapid steady state between 4 and 6
weeks. the dosing interval for  xxxd2450xxx  is once
every 24 hours. a loading dose of 100 mg daily for 3
days is recommended followed by a maintenance
dose of 20 mg daily. the active metabolite, a771726, has a long half-life of approximately 15 days
and may require almost 2 months to reach steady
state at a therapeutic dose of 20 mg daily. the dose
can be reduced to 10 mg daily if the 20-mg dose is
not tolerated (table 1).
 xxxd2450xxx  has no significant interactions with
warfarin, oral contraceptives, cimetidine, or oral hy-

eflunomide is a new disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (dmard) approved for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (ra).  xxxd2450xxx , an isoxazole derivative, inhibits pyrimidine
synthesis.  xxxd2450xxx  is a prodrug that is rapidly
converted to its active form, a77-1726, after oral
intake. in the early stages of development, animal
models of arthritis and autoimmunity were shown to
respond to administration of  xxxd2450xxx .  xxxd2450xxx  suppressed the development of systemic lupus
erythematosus in mrl/lpr mice1 and adjuvant arthritis in a rodent model.2 subsequent safety trials
and clinical application led to investigation of its
efficacy in the treatment of ra.
pharmacology
several mechanisms of action of  xxxd2450xxx  have
been described, but the main mechanism responsible for its effectiveness in treatment of ra is the
ability of a77-1726 to inhibit  xxxg633xxx , the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides.3,4 in autoimmune
diseases such as ra, activated lymphocytes require
an increased pyrimidine nucleotide pool (at least
8-fold) to progress from g1 to s phase of the cell
cycle. inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis by lefluno-

poglycemic medications,8,9 although it has been reported to increase the free fraction of diclofenac or
ibuprofen.8,10 this has been proposed as a possible
mechanism for the slight increase in hypertension
noted in patients taking  xxxd2450xxx .9 no changes in
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2450xxx  or methotrexate have been noted when these medications are
used in combination, although an increased risk of
liver toxicity has been seen.8,10,11 in patients who
had received multiple doses of rifampin, peak levels
of the  xxxd3316xxx  were noted to
increase 40% (above the peak noted in those taking
 xxxd2450xxx  alone) after a single dose of  xxxd2450xxx .
for this reason, caution is recommended when using
these 2 medications together (table 1).8
nearly 100% of a77-1726 is protein-bound and the
parent  xxxd2450xxx  is mostly undetectable.
a77-1726 is excreted through the bile and renal
systems at almost equal proportions. the enterohepatic recirculation of a77-1726 allows its rapid elimination by administration of activated charcoal or
 xxxd1684xxx ; however,  xxxd2450xxx  is nondialyzable.  xxxd2450xxx  is obviously contraindicated in
patients with a known hypersensitivity to  xxxd2450xxx  or any of its components.8  xxxd2450xxx  is teratogenic and is contraindicated in pregnant women
and those who wish to become pregnant and is also
not recommended in men who wish to father children,8,10,12 plasma level of a77-1726 should be
tested to be below 0.2 mg/l at 14 days apart before
pregnancy is initiated,8 although no animal studies
have been performed to evaluate potential fetal
damage.8,12 in the events of acute toxicity, pregnancy, or desired conception,  xxxd2450xxx  can be
removed using  xxxd1684xxx , 8 g 3 times daily for
the american journal of the medical sciences

11 days. it is not known whether  xxxd2450xxx  is
excreted in human milk; therefore, it is recommended to avoid using this drug in nursing mothers.8  xxxd2450xxx  is also not recommended in patients with hepatic compromise, including heavy
consumers of alcohol and patients with a history of
hepatitis.8,13 in contrast,  xxxd2450xxx  is not contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency but
should be used with caution.8,13
the most common drug-related adverse reactions
noted with  xxxd2450xxx  include diarrhea, nausea,
rashes and allergic reactions, reversible alopecia,
and transient elevations of liver enzymes.10,12–17 the
diarrhea is usually transient or responds to a decrease in the dose of  xxxd2450xxx  (table 1).9 mild
weight loss and headaches have also been noted in
some studies.10,14,15,17 drug-related hypertension
has been noted, but the incidence is fairly low, ranging from 1.1 to 6.8%.12,14,15 emery et al15 noted 28
cases of leucopenia in 501 patients taking  xxxd2450xxx  over a 2-year study period. these were felt to
possibly be related to the study drug but were not
felt to be clinically noteworthy. other studies have
noted no clinically significant hematologic toxicity,
renal dysfunction, or electrolyte disturbances with
 xxxd2450xxx .9,12,14 –16 interstitial pneumonitis, significant mucosal toxicity, opportunistic infections,
and uncontrolled endogenous infections, such as
herpes, were not seen in  xxxd2450xxx  trials. the
incidence of lymphoproliferative disorders has been
similar to that seen in ra patients treated with
methotrexate or  xxxd3255xxx .9,12,15,16
clinical applications
the fda approval of  xxxd2450xxx  was based on
the results of 3 large phase iii clinical trials referred
to as us301,12 mn301,14 and mn302.15 these trials
showed clinical efficacy and safety to be nearly equal
to methotrexate and  xxxd3255xxx  and statistically
significantly superior to placebo. in these 3 trials,
patients enrolled in the  xxxd2450xxx  groups received
a loading dose of 100 mg per day for 3 days. us30112
was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in the united states and canada, which
included 482 patients with active ra of at least 6
months’ duration. all patients received folate at 1
mg twice a day.  xxxd2450xxx  was statistically comparable with methotrexate in the treatment of ra.
the efficacy of  xxxd2450xxx  was seen after 4 weeks of
treatment and was sustained throughout the 52
weeks of study period. the acr20 response was
52% in the  xxxd2450xxx -treated group and 46% in
the methotrexate-treated group compared with 26%
in placebo group. structural damages as measured
by sharp x-ray scores for erosion and joint space
narrowing were reduced in both  xxxd2450xxx - and
methotrexate-treated groups compared with placebo
group.

 xxxd2450xxx  in rheumatoid arthritis

mn30114 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 358 active ra
patients comparing the efficacy of  xxxd2450xxx  (n ⫽
133),  xxxd3255xxx  (n ⫽ 133), and placebo (n ⫽ 92)
for a study period of 6 months.  xxxd2450xxx  was
statistically equivalent to  xxxd3255xxx  in the treatment of ra. the acr20 response rates were 55% for
 xxxd2450xxx , 56% for  xxxd3255xxx , and 29% for placebo. radiographic changes with less disease progression were similar in  xxxd2450xxx - and  xxxd3255xxx -treated groups and superior to the placebo
group at 6 months. mn30215 was also a multicenter,
double-blind, active controlled investigation of active ra treatment comparing methotrexate (7.5 to
15 mg per week) with  xxxd2450xxx  (20 mg daily) for
52 weeks. subjects who completed 52 weeks of treatment were allowed to continue double-blind treatment for another 52 weeks. folate supplementation
was not routinely use. at the end of 52 weeks,
acr20 response rates were 51% in the leflunomidetreated group and 65% in the methotrexate-treated
group. the acr50 and -70 response rates were also
slightly higher in the methotrexate group. the efficacy of both  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate was sustained in the second year with no further differences
between the 2 groups. a small and equivalent degree
of disease suppression as measured by radiographic
change was seen with both  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate during the first year of treatment. after 2
years, there was no further increase in joint damage
in patients treated with  xxxd2450xxx  but a small
improvement in patients treated with methotrexate,
resulting in a statistically significant difference
within the 2 groups. in these clinical trials, the onset
of treatment efficacy occurred earlier with  xxxd2450xxx  compared with other active treatment drugs.
subsequently,  xxxd2450xxx  was approved by the
fda in 1999 for treatment of active, adult onset ra.
it is considered a new oral dmard with indication
to suppress the clinical symptoms and to retard the
onset of structural joint damages, such as erosion or
joint-space narrowing.
choices of combination dmards that act on different but complimentary inflammatory cascades
seem to be garnering more support in the treatment
of ra. for example,  xxxd2450xxx  is cytostatic; methotrexate can enhance the effect of  xxxd2450xxx  by
inducing apoptosis of activated t-cells. an openlabel trial using  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate in
combination treatment of active ra showed significant improvement with acr20 response rate of 53%
in 16 patients at the end of 52 weeks. pharmacokinetic studies showed no interaction between  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate. the combination use was
considered safe but required careful monitoring of
liver transaminases. elevation of these enzymes
above upper limits of normal was observed in 19
patients, but in 70% of cases, levels reversed to ⬍1.2
times the upper limit of normal without dose reduc192

tion of  xxxd2450xxx . three patients withdrew from
the study because of persistent elevation of
transaminases. three other patients met criteria for
liver biopsy based on acr guidelines for methotrexate monitoring. no marked fibrosis or cirrhosis was
found. all patients continued to take both  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate with normalization of liver
enzymes in the second year of treatment.11
a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
trial using combination of  xxxd2450xxx  and methotrexate enrolling 266 ra patients who failed methotrexate alone has confirmed the efficacy of combination treatment. at 24 weeks, response rates were
52% for acr20, 26% for acr50, and 10% for acr70
in patients on combination  xxxd2450xxx /methotrexate compared with 23 (acr20), 6 (acr50), and 2%
(acr70), respectively, in patients treated with
placebo/methotrexate.18
elevation of liver enzymes with  xxxd2450xxx  are
not uncommon. strand et al12 noted some degree of
enzyme elevation in 14.8% of patients. however,
most liver enzyme elevations are mild [ⱕ2 times the
upper limit of normal (uln)] and are transient or
resolve with dose reduction.9,12,14 values ⬎3 times
the uln are much less common. smolen et al noted
3 cases in 108 patients.14 one patient had hepatitis
that was not viral in origin. strand et al12 reported
elevations ⬎3 times the uln of  xxxg941xxx  and aspartate aminotransferase in 4.4 and
2.2% of patients, respectively. these marked elevations still usually respond to dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment.8 recommendations regarding dosage adjustment are as follows: for
confirmed elevations ⱕ2-fold, reduce the dose to 10
mg once daily. for persistent elevations ⬎2-fold but
ⱕ3-fold after dose reduction, liver biopsy is recommended if treatment is to be continued. for persistent elevations ⬎3-fold after dose reduction, treatment should be discontinued and  xxxd1684xxx 
administered.8 serious liver disease in a patient
receiving methotrexate and leflunomide19 and severe pancytopenia after  xxxd2450xxx  treatment in
ra have been reported.20 one case of nonfatal sepsis
has been noted in  xxxd2450xxx  trials.12
 xxxd2450xxx  or its analogs have been shown to be
beneficial in several animal models of related autoimmunity, including myasthenia gravis, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, glomerulonephritis
and tubulonephritis, experimental autoimmune
uveitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, graft-versushost disease, adjuvant-induced arthritis, the nonobese diabetic mouse model of diabetes, allergic
asthma, and experimental autoimmune myocarditis.1,2,16,21  xxxd2450xxx  has also been shown to have
activity in several transplant models, acting synergistically with cyclosporine to prevent rejection.17,22,23 recent clinical reports have shown  xxxd2450xxx  has been shown to be effective in

its efficacy for wegener granulomatosis.24,25 clinical
trials are also underway to evaluate its use in sle
and uveitis.16 case reports have shown benefit from
 xxxd2450xxx  in felty syndrome and bullous
pemphigoid.26,27
conclusion
 xxxd2450xxx  has become a well-accepted, new oral
dmard designed as a specific inhibitor of t cell
function for treatment of patients with active ra. its
advantages include more rapid onset of response,
generally mild side effects, convenience of daily oral
intake, retardation of joint erosion and space narrowing, as well as a lower up-front cost compared
with biological therapies. given the fact that monotherapy in patients with active ra frequently fails
and short- and long-term disability are of great
economic burden,  xxxd2450xxx  offers a new alternative and hope for patients suffering from active ra.
as is true for all new drugs, the long-term clinical
advantages and safety remain to be seen.
