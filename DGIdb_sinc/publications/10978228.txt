pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (pde) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized seizures
in the first hours of life and responding only to pyridoxine hydrochloride. the pathogenesis of pde is unknown,
but an alteration in the binding of pyridoxal 5-phosphate to  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad) has been postulated
in patients with pde. results are reported for genetic linkage analyses in four families with consanguineous parents
and in one family with nonconsanguineous parents. the  xxxg849xxx  (2q31) and  xxxg850xxx  genes (10p23) were tested and
excluded. a genomewide search was subsequently performed, using microsatellite markers at an average distance
of 10 cm, and the search revealed linkage of the disease-causing gene to markers on chromosome 5q31.2-q31.3
(maximum lod score [zmax] 8.43 at recombination fraction [v] 0 and zmax p 7.58 at v p 0 at loci d5s2017 and
d5s1972, respectively). a recombination event, between loci d5s638 and d5s463, in one family defined the distal
boundary, and a second recombination event between loci d5s2011 and d5s2017 in another family defined the
proximal boundary of the genetic interval encompassing the pde gene (5.1 cm). ongoing studies may lead to the
identification of the disease-causing gene.

pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (pde [mim 226100]) is
a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a
combination of various seizure types that usually occurs
in the first hours of life and is unresponsive to standard
anticonvulsants, responding only to immediate administration of pyridoxine hydrochloride ( xxxd3049xxx )
(hunt et al. 1954; waldinger and berg 1964; nabbout
et al. 1999). the dependence is permanent, and the interruption of daily pyridoxine supplementation leads to
the recurrence of seizures. the pathogenesis of vitamin
b6–dependent seizures is unknown, but some researchers have postulated that a reduced synthesis of g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba), resulting from diminished activity
of the  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad), could be responsible for the lowered seizure threshold in vitamin
b6–dependent patients (scriver and whelan 1969; yoshida et al. 1971). gad requires pyridoxal 5-phosphate

(plp) as a coenzyme for activity, and an alteration in
the binding of plp to gad has also been postulated in
 xxxd3049xxx –dependent patients (scriver and whelan
1969; scriver and gibson 1995). biochemical findings
in affected individuals included (a) decreased levels of
gaba in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (csf), (b)
increased levels of glutamate in csf and the cerebral
cortex, and (c) decreased levels of plp in the frontal
cortex (lott et al. 1978; baumeister et al. 1994). study
of gad activity in the kidney of an affected proband
has revealed a complete deficiency of gaba synthesis,
with a restoration to normal levels when the coenzyme
is added (yoshida et al. 1971).
in this article, we report the genetic linkage analysis
of four families with consanguineous parents and of one
family with nonconsanguineous parents. the clinical
and electroencephalographic features of these families
have been reported elsewhere (nabbout et al. 1999). the
diagnosis of pde was based on the presence of generalized seizures that responded only to  xxxd3049xxx  administration in the first days of life. the families were
of turkish (family 1), french (family 2), maurician (family 3), and algerian ancestries (families 4 and 5).
dna extraction and microsatellite analyses were performed as described elsewhere (belin et al. 1998). the

from locus d5s2017 according to the généthon map.

homozygosity-mapping strategy in consanguineous families was based on the assumption that affected individuals from the same kindred are homozygous by descent,
for the disease-causing gene mutation. microsatellite
dna markers from the entire genome were chosen from
the généthon map (dib et al. 1996), and two-point linkage analyses using the mlink option of the linkage
package (lathrop et al. 1985) were performed. we assumed the frequency of the disease allele to be .001 and
set the penetrance at 100%, assuming an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. we took into account the
inbreeding loops, but allele frequencies were not available in the populations studied.
we first tested and excluded the  xxxg849xxx  (2q31) and
 xxxg850xxx  (10p.23) genes, because these genes were re-

garded a priori as excellent candidates (data not shown).
then, we performed a genomewide search, with the
use of microsatellite markers at an average distance of
10 cm, and found linkage of the disease-causing gene
to markers on chromosome 5q31.2-q31.3 (maximum
lod score [zmax] 8.43 at recombination fraction [v] 0
and zmax p 7.58 at v p 0, for markers afmb074xg1
and afma190bx1, respectively, at loci d5s2017 and
d5s1972, respectively) (table 1). the probands were
homozygotes at loci d5s2017, d5s1972, d5s402,
d5s2099, d5s436, d5s643, d5s2033, and d5s638, in
all consanguineous families. in family 5, affected individuals were genoidentical but were different from unaffected sibs. a recombination event between loci
d5s2011 and d5s2017 in family 2 defined the prox-

pedigrees and genotype data for markers spanning the pde-locus interval. markers are given in order, from the p telomere to
the q telomere. the region of homozygosity is blackened.

imal boundary of the genetic interval encompassing
the disease-causing gene. in addition, a second recombination event, between d5s638 and d5s463, in family
4 defined the distal boundary of the genetic interval encompassing the pde gene (5.1 cm) (fig. 1).
the physical map of the 5q31.3-qter has been reported by kostrzewa et al. (1998). more than 50 genes
and 1130 expressed sequence tags have been assigned
to distal chromosome 5q. among them, the gaba-a–
receptor gene cluster and the  xxxg981xxx  gene
( xxxg952xxx ) could be regarded as candidate genes in epilepsy; however, they are reported to map to chromosomes 5q33 and 5q32, respectively—that is, outside the
genetic interval defined by our study (genemap’99). at
least three genes mapped to the critical region—namely,
the fibroblast growth factor-1,  xxxg1601xxx ,
and kiaao555 genes. whether any of these genes is
involved in pde is under investigation.
in conclusion, we have excluded the primary involvement of gad in the pathogenesis of pde and have found
linkage of the disease-causing gene to the 5q31 region,
in the vicinity of a gaba-a–receptor gene cluster and
of a glutamate-receptor gene, but both genes were excluded by our linkage data. we hope that ongoing studies will identify the disease-causing gene and help to
explain the pathogenesis of pyridoxine dependence in
pde and, more generally, help to elucidate the pathogenesis of epileptic seizures in humans.
