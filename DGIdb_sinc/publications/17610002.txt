(ibd), intestinal activation of the transcription factor nfjb as well as intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1
expression, which is involved in recruiting leukocytes to
the side of inflammation is increased. moreover, colonic
 xxxd208xxx  (ara) proportions are increased and
 xxxd2777xxx  (oa) proportions are decreased. fish oils are
protective in ibd patients however, a side-by-side comparison between effects of fish oils, ara and oa has not
been made. we therefore, compared effects of  xxxd2318xxx  (epa) versus ara and oa on icam-1
expression in caco-2 enterocytes. to validate our model
we showed that dexamethasone,  xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxg1805xxx 
(gw7647) or pparc (troglitazone) agonists significantly
lowered icam-1 expression. icam-1 expression of nonstimulated and cytokine stimulated caco-2 cells cultured
for 22 days with ara was significant higher as compared
to epa and oa. furthermore, ara increased nf-jb
activation in a reporter cell-line as compared to epa.

creased interleukin (il)-6 and il-10 production by ara
as compared to epa. our results showed that ara but
not epa and oa activates nf-jb and elevates icam-1
expression in caco-2 enterocytes. it suggests that
replacement of ara by epa or oa in the colon mucosa
might have beneficial effects for ibd patients. finally, we
suggest that the pro-inflammatory effects of ara versus
epa and oa are not related to pparc activation and/or
eicosanoid formation.

introduction
epidemiological studies have shown a low incidence of
inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) in eskimo’s as compared to west-european populations [1] and increasing
incidences of ibd in japan [2]. these findings suggest that
an increased dietary intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (pufa) and a lower intake of n-3 pufas contribute
to the development of ibd. thus, n-3 fish oil pufas may
have anti-inflammatory effects as compared to n-6 pufa
[3]. indeed, elevated proportions of the n-6 pufa  xxxd208xxx  (ara) in colon mucosa of both ulcerative
colitis (uc) and crohn’s disease (cd) patients as compared to those of control subjects have been shown [4–7].
although the proportion of the n-3 pufa eicosapentaenoic
acid (epa) in the mucosa was in most studies not statistically different between ibd patients and healthy controls,
one study reported a tendency towards lower epa proportions in ibd patients [4]. in contrast to epa, the proportion of the fish oil pufa docosahexaenoic acid (dha)
was elevated in colonic mucosa of ibd patients as compared to control subjects [4, 5, 7]. interestingly, the proportion of the n-9 monounsaturated fatty acid (mufa)
 xxxd2777xxx  (oa) was lower in colon mucosa of ibd patients
[4, 7]. because of these observations, and because epa is a
more important precursor of eicosanoids than dha [8], we
decided to compare the effects of epa versus ara and
oa in an in vitro model of intestinal inflammation. oa is
already the most abundant fatty acid present both in our
diet [9] as well as in colon mucosa [4]. therefore, and
because of differences in ability to compete with ara for
incorporation in tissue phospholipids [10, 11], it is probably easier to lower mucosal ara levels by increasing fish
oil intake than by increasing oa intake. indeed, by
increasing their intake of fish oil, ara in the colon mucosa
of ibd patients was replaced by epa and dha [12], which
was associated with significantly reduced corticosteroid
requirements [12] and lower relapse rates [13]. it should be
noted however, that not all intervention studies using fish
oils were that positive, although the overall conclusion is
that fish oil supplementation shows at least minor protective effects [14].
the intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1 plays an
important role in the pathology of ibd. in ibd patients
intestinal icam-1 expression [15] and plasma levels of
soluble icam-1 (sicam) are increased [16], and ibd is
associated with polymorphisms in the gene encoding for
icam-1 [17]. moreover, animal models [18, 19] and a
human intervention study [20] have shown that icam-1
blocking inhibited intestinal inflammation. the transcription factor nf-jb is a key regulator of the inflammatory
response and activation of nf-jb seems to play a critical
role in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal  xxxd2315xxx -

mation in ibd [21, 22]. nf-jb activity in the colon is
increased during active episodes in ibd patients and certain anti-inflammatory drugs commonly used for ibd appear to inhibit nf-jb [23–27]. in animal models, nf-jb
blockade abolished experimental colitis [28, 29]. a sideby-side comparison of the n-3 pufa epa, the n-6 pufa
ara and the n-9 mufa oa on icam-1 expression and
nf-jb activation of intestinal cells has, as far as we are
aware of, never been performed. therefore the aim of the
present study was to compare the effects of epa, ara and
oa on icam-1 expression and nf-jb activation in the
human intestinal epithelial caco-2 cell line in vitro.

materials and methods
reagents
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa; endotoxin and fatty acidfree),  xxxd3255xxx , dexamethasone, gw7647,  xxxd2777xxx 
(oa),  xxxd208xxx  (ara),  xxxd2318xxx 
(epa) and indomethacin were obtained from sigma
chemical company (st louis, mo). troglitazone was
purchased from biomol (plymouth meeting, pa). recombinant human il-1b and interferon (ifn)c were purchased from roche molecular biochemicals (mannheim,
germany). dmem, trypsin, penicillin streptomycin (ps),
sodium pyruvate (sp) and non-essential amino acids
(neaa) were obtained from invitrogen corporation
(paisley, uk). fetal calf serum (fcs; south-american)
was obtained from greiner bio-one (frickenhausen,
germany).
intestinal cell cultures
the human cell line caco-2 was purchased from the
american tissue type collection (attc). caco-2 cells
were cultured in dmem supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fcs and 1% penicillin streptomycin (ps), 1%
sodium pyruvate (sp) and 1% non-essential amino acids
(neaa). cells were cultured at 37 c in a 5% co2
humidified atmosphere, refreshed every second day and
separated by trypsin–0.03% edta, when they had reached
70–90% confluence. to evaluate the immune-modulating
effects of different interventions, caco-2 cells were plated
in six well tissue culture plates at an initial density of
0.5 · 106 cells/ml in a total volume of 1.5 ml. medium
was replaced every other day for 24 days. after 24 days
caco-2 wells were fully differentiated into small intestinal
enterocytes [30]. first, effects of immune-suppressive
pharmacological compounds ( xxxd3255xxx , dexamethasone and troglitazone) were tested to validate the model.
although these pharmacologic compounds have known

lipids (2007) 42:687–698

immune-suppressive effects, effects on icam-1 expression
in caco-2 cells have—as far as we know—not been reported before. therefore, after caco-2 cells were fully
differentiated, medium was replaced by medium containing
the compound of interest in combination with an inflammation-inducing cocktail consisting of the cytokines ifnc
(100 u/ml) and il-1b (50 u/ml). the compounds of
interest were pre-incubated 30 min ( xxxd3255xxx ) or 2 h
(dexamethasone, troglitazone or gw7647) before stimulation with the cytokine cocktail. after 16 h of cytokine
stimulation, cells were used to determine cell surface
icam-1 protein expression.
fatty acid experiments
the effects of various  xxxd2154xxx  were evaluated using the
same caco-2 cell model. for this, various  xxxd2154xxx  were
added at indicated concentrations 2 days after plating the
cells and again for the following 22 days each time when
the medium was refreshed. we used oa as a control n-9
mufa because this is the most abundant fatty acid in the
diet [9]. we further compared the effects of the n-6 pufa
ara versus the n-3 pufa epa. we have explicitly chosen to use epa instead of dha since the proportion dha
in the colon mucosa of ibd patients was already higher as
compared to control subjects [4, 5, 7]. in addition, epa is
most likely a more important eicosanoid precursor [8]. the
 xxxd2154xxx  were dissolved in ethanol up to a final ethanol
concentration in the medium of maximal 0.5% (v/v). to
prevent cytotoxicity of the  xxxd2154xxx  the fa were bound to
albumin, by pre-incubating the  xxxd2154xxx  dissolved in
ethanol for 30 min at 37 c in full culture medium together
with 10% fcs, which also contained 0.1% bsa. caco-2
cells were cultured with respectively 160 lm oa
[c18:1(n-9)] versus 130 lm ara [ xxxd208xxx (n-6)] plus
30 lm oa (in total 160 lm  xxxd2154xxx ) or 6 lm epa
[c20:5(n-3)] plus 154 lm oa (in total also 160 lm fatty
acids). by this approach the total molarity of  xxxd2154xxx 
supplied was similar in all experiments, while supplying
different amounts of the fatty acid of interest (i.e., 130 lm
ara or 6 lm epa). these relatively low concentrations
of oa (160 lm), ara (130 lm) and epa (6 lm) were
chosen because they are four times higher than normally
present in culture medium of caco-2 cells containing 10%
fcs. we have deliberately chosen for this low epa concentration since the epa concentration is very low in fcs.
however, the epa concentration used is—as for all fatty
acids used in these experiments—already four times higher
than normally present in culture medium. we cultured the
cells for 22 days with these relatively low concentrations
of  xxxd2154xxx  to simulate a realistic long-term in vivo
change in dietary fatty acid intake. after 22 days culture
with  xxxd2154xxx , medium was replaced by medium enriched

689

with the different  xxxd2154xxx  plus the cytokine cocktail
[ifnc (100 u/ml) and il-1b (50 u/ml)]. after 16 h
stimulation, icam-1 expression on living cells was measured and culture medium was collected to determine
inflammatory protein expression profiles. to evaluate the
effects of the  xxxd2154xxx  on nf-jb activity and the role of
cyclooxygenase (cox)-enzymes, the experiments with the
 xxxd2154xxx  ara and epa were repeated but now in our
nf-jb reporter caco-2 cell line with and without indomethacin (20 lm) added 2 h before and during cytokine
stimulation. prostaglandin pge2 levels in the supernatant
were quantitated using a pge2 biotrak enzyme-immunoassay (eia) system (amersham biosciences ltd,
buckinghamshire, uk) according to the high sensitivity
enzyme immunoassay protocol 2.
flow cytometry analysis of icam-1
in order to quantify cell surface icam-1 protein expression
on living caco-2 cells, we developed a flow cytometry
assay. after 16 h of stimulation, the cells were washed
three times with pbs and detached with trypsin–0.03%
edta. next, medium was added and cell suspensions were
centrifuged for 5 min at 1,200 rpm at room temperature,
followed by resuspending the pellets in 500 ll pbs-1%
bsa. cells were counted and diluted to 106 cells/ml in
pbs-1% bsa. recombinant-phycoerythrin (r-pe)-conjugated mouse-anti-human cd-54 monoclonal antibody
(anti-icam-1) or isotype-matched control antibody (becton dickinson biosciences, san diego, ca; 20 ll/106
cells) was added and incubated for 30 min on ice in the
dark. next, cell suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min at
1,500 rpm and pellets were resuspended in 500 ll pbs1% bsa. the amount of fluorescence of 10,000 living cells
was counted and analyzed with the facsort and cellquest
analysis software (becton dickinson, franklin lakes, nj).
stable transfection of nf-jb in caco-2 cells
for evaluating the effects of the various interventions on
transcriptional activity of nf-jb, a stable nf-jb reporter
caco-2 cell line was created. the 6jb-tk-luciferase (nfjb reporter) plasmid and neomycin resistance plasmid
were both kindly provided by dr. r.c. langen (department of pulmonology, maastricht university, the netherlands). cells were transfected using lipofectamine 2000
(invitrogen corporation, paisley, uk) according the manufacturers’ instructions. positive clones were selected by
culturing with  xxxd2191xxx  (1 mg/ml). to determine luciferase activity, non-stimulated and 3 h cytokine (100 u/ml
ifnc and 50 u/ml il-1b) stimulated cells were lysed in
luciferase lysis buffer (promega, madison, wi) and stored
at –80 c. luciferase (promega) activity was measured

according to the manufacturers’ instructions and expressed
relative to total protein (bio-rad assay; bio-rad, hercules,
ca).
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)c
and  xxxg1805xxx  mrna expression of differentiated
caco-2 cells
total rna was extracted from differentiated caco-2 cells
with trizol according to the manufacturers’ instructions
(gibco brl, gaithersburg, md). next, cdna was made
as described [31], and mrna expression of pparc and
 xxxg1805xxx  was determined using commercially available
taqman gene expression assays (applied biosystems,
foster city, ca). data were normalized against b-actin as
housekeeping gene.
fatty acid composition of caco-2 cells
fatty acid incorporation into the caco-2 cells was evaluated using extraction and analysis procedures as previously
described [32]. briefly, total lipids were extracted from
500 ll cell suspension in pbs-1% bsa according to the
method of bligh and dyer [33]. aminopropyl-bonded silica columns (varian, harbor city, ca) were used to separate phospholipids from the total lipid extract [34]. the
phospholipids were then saponified, and the resultant fatty
acids were methylated into their corresponding fatty acid
methyl esters (fames) [35].  xxxd2154xxx  were separated on
an autosystem (perkin-elmer, norwalk, ct) gas chromatograph that was fitted with a silica-gel column (cp-sil
88 for fame, 50 m · 0.25 mm, 0.2-lm film thickness;
chrompack, middelburg, the netherlands) with helium
gas (130 kpa) as the carrier gas. both the injection and
detection temperatures were set at 300 c. the starting
temperature of the column was 160 c. ten min after
injection, the temperature was increased up to 190 c at a
rate of 2.5 c/min. after 20 min at 190 c, the temperature was increased up to 230 c at a rate of 4 c/min. the
final temperature of 230 c was maintained for 10 min.
data were analyzed by using chromcard software
(version 1.21; ce instruments, milan, italy). the fatty acid
compositions of the caco-2 cells are expressed in relative
amounts (% of total  xxxd2154xxx  identified; w/w).
inflammatory protein expression profiles using
an antibody array
protein expression patterns of multiple cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, were detected simultaneously in
caco-2 cell culture media with the human cytokine antibody array iii (ray biotech inc., norcross, ga) according
to the manufacturers’ instructions. first, duplicates of cell

culture media of caco-2 cells cultured with ara and epa
after cytokine stimulation were pooled. one millilitre of
the pooled samples was added to the array membranes.
after incubating and washing, the protein-bound membrane was incubated with a cocktail of biotin-labeled
antibodies, followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. array spot intensity was
detected by using a las-3000 lite image reader (raytest
gmbh, straubenhart, germany) based on chemiluminecence imaging. intensity of the spots was quantified in
arbitrary units (a.u.) by densitometry using aida software
version 3.50 (raytest gmbh), thereby correcting for
background staining of the gel. comparison of protein
expression profiles was possible after normalization of each
spot on an array using the positive controls, provided by the
manufacturer. the sensitivity of the array is not the same
for the various proteins. differences in heights of bars from
different proteins do therefore not necessarily represent
differences in concentrations. the cytokines used for
stimulation (ifnc and il-1b) were excluded from analysis.
detection of icam-1 on caco-2 frozen sections
to determine the localization of icam-1 in our in vitro
caco-2 cell model, caco-2 cells were cultured and differentiated into small intestinal enterocyte on collagen-coated
polyfluoroethylene transwell membrane inserts with a
0.4 lm membrane pore size (corning costar, cambridge,
ma). differentiated caco-2 cells were stimulated with
ifnc (100 u/ml) and il-1b (50 u/ml) for 16 h, embedded
in tissue-tek (sakura finetek, zoeterwoude, the netherlands) and rapidly frozen in  xxxd2400xxx  (fluka, zwijndrecht, the netherlands), dry-ice-cooled and stored at
–80 c. serial cryosections (10 lm) were obtained using a
leica cm3050 cryostat (leica microsystems gmbh,
wetzlar, germany) and thaw mounted on uncoated glass
slides. before processing or storage at –80 c, the samples
were air dried overnight. to detect icam-1 the sections
were incubated 30 min in the dark at room temperature
with recombinant-phycoerythrin (r-pe)-conjugated mouse–
anti-human cd-54 monoclonal antibody or isotypematched control antibody (becton dickinson biosciences,
san diego, ca) 1:50 diluted in pbs-1% bsa. to detect
cytokeratin (ck)-19 the sections were simultaneously
incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed to  xxxg1288xxx ,
kindly obtained from dr. e.b. lane (university dundee,
dundee, uk) 1:10 diluted. then the sections were washed
three times for 5 min in pbs. after that the secondary
antibody goat anti-mouse igg1 (alexa555) (molecular
probes europe, leiden, the netherlands) (1:500) against
anti- xxxg1127xxx  (to evade fast quenching of the pe-label) and
goat anti-mouse igg2b (fitc) (southern biotech, sanbio
bv, uden, the netherlands) (1:50) against  xxxg1288xxx  diluted

lipids (2007) 42:687–698

in pbs-1% bsa was added to the sections and incubated
for 30 min. again the sections were washed three times for
5 min with pbs. finally, sections were mounted in
mowiol-tris ph 8.5 (calbiochem, omnilabo international, etten-leur, the netherlands) containing 0.5 g/ml
4–6-diamino-2-phenylindole (dapi; molecular probes
europe) to stain the nuclei. all sections were examined
using a nikon e800 fluorescence microscope (uvikon,
bunnik, the netherlands) coupled to a basler a101c
progressive scan colour ccd camera. by just a simple shift
in filters, images were grabbed in fluorescence using the
alexa excitation filter (540–580 nm), the fitc excitation filter (465–495 nm) and dapi uv excitation filter
(340–380 nm) in the red, green and blue channel, respectively. the images acquired were merged to examine the
cellular localisation and level of expression of icam-1.

interventions) or anova (comparison between three
interventions) with a bonferonni post-hoc test when differences between interventions were significantly different,
were performed. first non-stimulated values between
interventions were tested to examine differences in basal
values. then, net stimulated values between interventions
were tested to examine differences in cytokine-induced
changes. furthermore cytokines stimulated values were
tested to examine differences in ‘‘end’’ values. all statistical analyses were performed using spss 11 for mac os x
(spss, chicago, il). p-values of less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

icam-1 expression was significantly decreased as compared to control (p = 0.044). also the net stimulated
icam-1 expression (25 a.u.) was significantly reduced as
compared to control (p = 0.019). next, we examined the
effect of another frequently used therapeutic drug for ibd
patients,  xxxd3255xxx . effects of  xxxd3255xxx  were comparable to those observed for dexamethasone. however,
also icam-1 expression without cytokine stimulation
(p = 0.004) (fig. 1, panel a) was lowered. altogether,
these results show that in our cell model icam-1 expression is related to the clinical outcomes of drugs proven to
treat ibd and could therefore be used as the main outcome
parameter in the following experiments. to further validate
characteristics of our in vitro model, we also localized the
site of icam-1 expression on the caco-2 cells by means of
immunohistochemistry on frozen sections. as shown in
fig. 1 (panels c–f), icam-1 was expressed on the apical
(lumen) side of the polarized caco-2 cells. besides a low
constitutive expression (panel d), there was a clear increase
after stimulation with the cytokine cocktail (panel e). this
localisation is in line with the apical icam-1 expression,
as found in intestinal biopsies from ibd patients [36].

edione (tzd)] and the  xxxg1805xxx  agonist gw7647 on  xxxg1127xxx  expression. although both troglitazone and gw7647
significantly lowered the cytokine stimulated icam-1
expression as compared to control (p < 0.001 and
p = 0.009, respectively), only troglitazone significantly
(p = 0.008) reduced the net stimulated icam-1 expression
(fig. 2, panels a and b). troglitazone and gw7647 were
used at a concentration where they are selective for their
receptor subtypes [37, 38]. it is known that ppars suppress inflammation by inhibiting the transcription factor
nf-jb, which is a key regulator of inflammation [39].
therefore, we also examined effects of troglitazone on nfjb transactivation in our caco-2 nf-jb reporter cell line.
these results showed that the cytokine cocktail induced
after already 3 h a more than 200% increase in nf-jb
transactivation. this increase of nf-jb transactivation was
significantly (p = 0.008) lower after 2 h pre-treatment with
the pparc agonist troglitazone (fig. 2, panels c and d).
moreover, the inhibitory effect of pre-treatment with the
pparc agonist troglitazone on cytokine induced nf-jb
transactivation was significantly (p = 0.001) larger as
compared to pre-treatment with the  xxxg1805xxx  agonist
gw7647 (data not shown).

effects of ppar agonists on icam-1 expression
and nf-jb activation

fatty acid incorporation in phospholipids

since ppars are known modulators of inflammation and
 xxxd2154xxx  are natural ligands for ppars, we first examined
ppar expression in our differentiated caco-2 cells. we
found that  xxxg1805xxx  and pparc mrna are expressed in
equal amounts (data not shown). next we examined the
effects of the pparc agonist troglitazone [a  xxxd3355xxx -

table 1 shows that the  xxxd2154xxx  kept for 22 days in the
culture medium were incorporated into the phospholipid
fraction (% of total  xxxd2154xxx ) of the caco-2 cells. fatty
acid incorporation into phospholipids showed the same
pattern as the fatty acid composition of total lipids (data not

pronounced. moreover, the fatty acid profiles of phospholipids (table 1) and total lipids (data not shown) were
similar in non-stimulated and stimulated caco-2 cells.
cells cultured with ara showed in particular an increase
in the proportion of long chain n-6 pufas (mainly ara)
and a decrease in n-9 mufas (mainly oa) as compared
with cells cultured with only oa. the cells cultured with
epa showed an increase in the proportion of n-3  xxxd2154xxx 
(mainly epa) whereas the proportions of n-9 mufas and
n-6 pufas did not change much as compared with cells
cultured with only oa.
effects of  xxxd2154xxx  on icam-1 expression and nfjb activation
icam-1 expression was analyzed on living cells. facs
analysis did not show significant changes in cell populations cultured with the various  xxxd2154xxx , suggesting no
significant cell death. as shown in fig. 3 (panel a), ara
significantly elevated icam-1 expression as compared to
oa or epa (non-stimulated p < 0.001 ara versus oa
and ara versus epa, and stimulated p = 0.010 ara
versus oa, and p = 0.013 ara versus epa). interestingly, stimulated and non-stimulated icam-1 expression
on cells cultured with epa did not significantly differ from
those cultured with oa (fig. 3, panel a). despite these

clear differences in non-stimulated and stimulated icam-1
expression between ara and epa or oa, the net stimulated icam-1 expression did not differ between the groups
(anova p = 0.134). since dietary interventions aiming at
lowering mucosal ara content are most likely more successful by dietary epa enrichments than by oa enrichment–because oa is the most abundant fatty acid present
in our diet [9], making higher intakes not realistic–in further experiments we have focused on effects of ara
versus epa. first, we examined the effects on nf-jb
activation in the stable nf-jb reporter caco-2 cell line
(fig. 4). nf-jb transactivation in stimulated caco-2 cells
cultured with ara was significantly increased as compared to that in stimulated cells cultured with epa (fig. 4,
panels a and b) (stimulated p = 0.017 and net stimulated
p = 0.001). to evaluate whether the effects were related to
the production of different families of eicosanoids we
measured pge2 production and examined the effects of the
different  xxxd2154xxx  in the presence of the cyclooxygenase
(cox)-inhibitor indomethacin. as expected, pge2 production by caco-2 cells cultured with ara was significantly higher than by cells cultured with epa (data not
shown). stimulation of the cells with the cytokine cocktail
did however, not influence pge2 production. since cytokine stimulation enhanced nf-jb activation, this suggests
that pge2 is not directly involved in nf-jb activation.

expression was not affected (data not shown). however, as
shown in fig. 4, the effects of ara versus epa in the

presence of indomethacin treatment (panel e) showed an
identical pattern as observed without indomethacin (panel

icam-1 seems important in the pathology of ibd [15].
whether fish oils, which have been shown to protect
against relapses in ibd patients on remission [13], have
effects on icam-1 expression, is however, unknown. in
addition, a direct side-by-side comparison of fish oils with
ara, which is postulated to have pro-inflammatory effects
[40] and is elevated in the colon mucosa of ibd patients [4,
7], has never been made. the transcription factor nf-jb is
important in regulating intestinal inflammation and is elevated in ibd patients [21, 22, 26]. we have now shown
that the n-3 pufa epa, as compared to the n-6 pufa

ara, clearly reduced cytokine stimulated nf-jb activation and icam-1 expression in enterocytes in vitro.
moreover, effects of oa on icam-1 expression were
comparable to those of epa. because epa and oa resulted in comparable changes in the proportions of ara in
the phospholipids of the enterocytes, the reported effects
may be ascribed to the increased ara proportion in the
ara cultured cells. thus, decreasing cellular ara levels
seems to be a crucial step. since oa is already the most
abundant fatty acid present in our diet [9] and in the colon
mucosa [4], decreasing mucosal ara levels may be easier
by increasing fish oil intake than by increasing oa intake.
moreover, epa does compete with ara for incorporation
into tissue phospholipids [10, 11].
our data showed that replacing ara for epa or oa
decreased icam-1 expression and nf-jb activation in
caco-2 enterocytes. in line with our observations in enterocytes, n-6 pufas also increased nf-jb activation as
compared to n-3 pufas in monocytes [41] and macrophages [42]. also, earlier in vitro studies have demonstrated that fish oils reduced cytokine stimulated icam-1
expression in endothelial cells [43] and monocytes [44] as
compared to conditions without addition of  xxxd2154xxx .
moreover, in vivo icam-1 expression (surface and
mrna) on peritoneal macrophages was reduced in mice
fed fish oils compared to that in mice fed coconut oil [45].
in humans, dietary fish oil supplementation lowered
expression of icam-1 on ex vivo stimulated monocytes as
compared to no supplementation [46]. however, our study

finally, to explore the effects of ara and epa on a
broader scale, we evaluated protein expression profiles
consisting of various inflammatory mediators by using
antibody arrays. figure 5 shows that ara treatment particularly increased expression of monocyte chemotactic

increased il-10, il-6, macrophage inflammatory protein

is the first that examined effects of epa versus ara on
icam-1 expression and nf-jb activation in enterocytes.
we however, realize that, although enterocytes play an
important role in intestinal inflammation, immune modulating effects of  xxxd2154xxx  in cd patients will be influenced not only by enterocytes, but also the interaction with
other intestinal immune and non-immune cells is important. therefore, in future experiments effects on other cell
types, e.g. isolated from mucosal biopsies of cd patients
should be evaluated. moreover, to validate if the effects of
epa versus ara are also applicable in the pathogenesis or
even the treatment of cd patients, these effects should be
confirmed in appropriate animal models of ibd.
we used an approach of supplying different amounts of
the  xxxd2154xxx  of interest (i.e., 130 lm ara or 6 lm
epa), while the total molarity of  xxxd2154xxx  supplied was
similar in all experiments by adding oa. these different
concentrations of ara and epa were deliberately chosen
because they were both four times the amount, in which the
cells grow normally (i.e., the fatty acid composition of
culture medium with 10% fcs). since the epa concentration is very low in fcs, we have deliberately chosen for
a low epa concentration. higher concentrations of epa
would be interesting to examine, however, are difficult to
be achieved with dietary interventions in vivo. using isomolaric total concentrations of  xxxd2154xxx  is essential,
because an increase in total fat can be immune suppressive
[47]. therefore, we used oa as a reference fatty acid to
make total fatty acid concentrations between experimental
fatty acid conditions iso-molaric, i.e. oa was exchanged
for ara or epa. in addition, we evaluated the condition of
oa only. the results of this latter condition showed that
decreasing ara levels in the mucosa seems to be more
important than increasing epa levels.
regarding the pathways underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of fish oils, several suggestions have been made.
as compared to n-6 pufas, n-3 pufas may have different
effects on (i) signal transduction pathways, and (ii) the
types and levels of eicosanoids synthesized [40]. regarding
the first mechanism, our finding that epa lowered nf-jb
activation and icam-1 expression as compared to ara
indeed showed that epa and ara differently affected the
nf-jb signal transduction pathway. in this respect, two
peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (ppars),
 xxxg1805xxx  and pparc, seem relevant, since  xxxd2154xxx  are
natural ligands for these ppars. both ppars seem to have
anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nf-jb activation
[48, 49]. in our in vitro model, the pparc agonist troglitazone inhibited nf-jb activation, and cytokine and net
stimulated icam-1 expression, while the  xxxg1805xxx  agonist
gw7647 only inhibited cytokine-stimulated icam-1
expression. this suggests that both pparc and  xxxg1805xxx 
have anti-inflammatory effects on enterocytes, in which

123

lipids (2007) 42:687–698

effects of pparc seem more pronounced. this is in
agreement with the finding that pparc agonists but not a
 xxxg1805xxx  agonist inhibited il-8 expression of caco-2 cells
and ht-29 cells [50]. differences between  xxxd2154xxx  in
activation of ppars might explain the activation of nf-jb
by ara and not by epa in our caco-2 cells. however, our
findings are not supported by the pparc binding affinities
of epa and ara, which are about the same [51], while we
used much lower epa concentrations than ara concentrations. secondly, not only epa but also oa lowered
intestinal icam-1 expression while oa is a poor pparc
ligand [51]. therefore, although pparc activation certainly protects against inflammation, our results do not
suggest that the protective effects of epa and oa as
compared to ara on intestinal inflammation are pparcmediated. therefore, there should be another explanation
why effects of oa and epa were comparable but different
from those of ara.
the mechanism underlying a second possible explanation relates to the incorporation of  xxxd2154xxx  into cell
membrane phospholipids and eicosanoids synthesis. eicosanoids can modulate the intensity and duration of the
inflammatory response. [8, 40] replacement of ara by
epa in the culture medium of the cells resulted in a decrease in the proportion of ara in cell membranes and an
increase in the epa proportion and as expected the pge2
production of caco-2 cells cultured with epa was also
lower than pge2 production of cells cultured with ara.
however, pge2 production was not different between nonstimulated and stimulated cells, while stimulation resulted
in an abundant elevation of nf-jb activation. to our
opinion this rules out the role of pge2 in the nf-jb
activation of ara and epa. moreover, although in our
experiments indomethacin–a blocker of cox–indeed
inhibited pge2 production, it did not lower nf-jb activation. this is in line with findings of de catherina et al.
[43] showing that in endothelial cells the effects of dha
on  xxxg2406xxx  expression could not be inhibited by indomethacin, although prostacyclin production was completely suppressed. therefore, we fully agree that in an
in vivo situation pro-inflammatory effects of ara are
probably mediated by eicosanoids synthesized from ara,
however, these effects are not derived from a direct
eicosanoid mediated activation of nf-jb as shown in our
model.
finally, we evaluated inflammatory protein signatures of
caco-2 cell culture medium after 22 days treatment with
epa versus ara. since these signatures were analyzed in
pooled material we cannot draw conclusions based on
statistical analysis. however, this array was intended to
generate hypotheses about differences in immune modulating effect of ara versus epa based on the protein
expression profiles. these profiles indicate, that both fatty

lipids (2007) 42:687–698

acids induced specific changes in various inflammation
mediators. most of these proteins, but not all, are regulated
by nf-jb. for example, il-6 protein expression was
higher after epa as compared to ara, whereas nf-jb
activation was higher after ara. it should however, be
considered that although highly important, nf-jb is not
the only transcription factor involved in the regulation of
il-6 and other inflammatory proteins. thus, expression of
individual proteins cannot be predicted by the level of nfjb activation solely. in addition, we found clear differences between epa and ara, i.e., that some proteins were
expressed higher after epa (il-6, il-10, mip-1d and
gro), while others were higher expressed after ara
( xxxg357xxx , and  xxxg160xxx ). the precise role of these individual proteins in the process of intestinal inflammation is
not clear. however, the increased  xxxg357xxx  expression after
ara treatment is in line with the finding that  xxxg357xxx 
expression is upregulated in the mucosa of ibd patients
and correlates with disease activity [52]. the increased
expression of the th2 cytokine il-10 after epa treatment
fits with the anti-inflammatory role for il-10 in ibd
pathology. in this respect, il-10 knockout mice develop
chronic intestinal inflammation and delivery of recombinant il-10 to the intestinal mucosa by the bacterium
l. lactis attenuated mucosal inflammation in two mouse
models [53]. in humans, a pilot study using these bacteria
showed also promising effects [54].
in conclusion, we have shown that ara but not epa and
oa activates nf-jb and elevates icam-1 expression in
caco-2 enterocytes and we hypothesize that the effects are
not related to pparc activation or eicosanoid formation.
