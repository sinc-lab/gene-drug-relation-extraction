incubation of bovine chromaffin cells with l-[14c]phenylalanine resulted in label accumulation in catecholamines at about
30 % of the rate seen with l-tyrosine as precursor. studies with purified  xxxg2276xxx  ( xxxg2276xxx ) showed that
the enzyme catalysed the hydroxylation of l-phenylalanine first to  xxxd3459xxx  and then to 3, xxxd2471xxx 
(dopa). no evidence for a significant involvement of an l-m-tyrosine intermediate in dopa formation was found.

introduction
the hydroxylation of phenylalanine by  xxxg2276xxx  ( xxxg2276xxx ,  xxxg2276xxx ) was reported as
early as the 1960's with partially purified enzyme preparations
from dog brain, bovine adrenal medulla and guinea-pig heart
[1-4]. direct injection of labelled phenylalanine into brains of
rats resulted in the formation of labelled catecholamines [5]. in
spite ofthese early observations, the possibility that phenylalanine
could be a physiologically significant precursor for catecholamine
biosynthesis in neurons and chromaffin cells has remained
controversial, probably for the following reasons: (1) nonenzymic oxidation of phenylalanine to tyrosine in the presence of
cofactor and dioxygen is known to occur [6,7]; (2) one of the
products of the enzymic reaction catalysed by tyrosine
hydroxylase was claimed to be m-tyrosine [8], which was found
not to be a substrate for the enzyme [9]; and (3) highly purified
preparations of  xxxg2276xxx  were reported not to
catalyse phenylalanine hydroxylation [10,1 1]. in our laboratory,
however, phenylalanine was found to be almost as good a
substrate for highly purified  xxxg2276xxx  as tyrosine
itself under certain experimental conditions in vitro [12]. in the
present study we confirm and extend this finding, by showing
that phenylalanine can also be utilized for the biosynthesis of
catecholamines in isolated bovine adrenal chromaffin cells.
materials and methods
materials
all chemicals were reagent grade and obtained from standard
suppliers. substrates and catalase were from sigma chemical
co. (6r)-l- xxxd2033xxx -tetrahydropterin was from dr. b. schircks
laboratories (jona, switzerland). radioisotopes were from
amersham.  xxxg2276xxx  was purified from adrenalmedulla cytosol [13] and assayed as described previously [14].

preparation of chromaffin cells
bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were isolated essentially as
described by livett [15]. yields were (5-10) x 107 cells for four
glands, and the viability was 90 % or more, as determined by the
trypan blue exclusion method. the catecholamine content of
the cell preparations was 185 + 22 nmol/ 106 cells, and the molar
ratio of adrenaline to noradrenaline was 3.4 + 0.8 (n = 6).

incubation of chromaffin cells with 114cjphenylalanine and

13hltyrosine
biosynthesis of catecholamines was determined by incubation
of chromaffin cells with [14c]phenylalanine or [3h]tyrosine at
37 'c. in time-course experiments, the reaction was stopped by
addition of hci04 (final concn. 3%, w/w) and cooling. the
supernatants were neutralized to ph 3-5 with k2c03, and the
context of catecholamines was assayed by h.p.l.c. as described
below. further details of the incubation conditions are given in
the figure legends.
the hydroxylated products of phenylalanine and tyrosine were
separated by h.p.l.c. on a strong cation exchanger (whatman
partisphere scx, 12.5 cm column, with a cx guard pre-column)
and quantified by fluorimetric detection [14], with excitation at
274 nm and emission at 304 nm for dopa, tyrosine and mtyrosine, and excitation at 258 nm and emission at 288 nm for
phenylalanine. this latter pair of wavelengths was also used for
assay of noradrenaline and adrenaline in cell extracts, because
the catecholamines were eluted immediately after phenylalanine.
l-m-tyrosine was isolated from the racemic mixture by using
a bakerbond crownpak cr chiral h.p.l.c. column (daicel
chemical industries, tokyo, japan) with hc104 (1.63 g/l) as the
mobile phase, neutralized with k2co3 and concentrated under
reduced pressure.

results
biosynthesis of catecholamines in chromaffin cells
the chromatographic systems used to separate and quantify
the products in the catecholamine-biosynthetic pathway are
shown in fig. 1. adrenal chromaffin cells incubated with
[3h]tyrosine incorporated label into noradrenaline and
adrenaline almost in parallel (fig. 2a). the amount of adrenaline
formed after 60 min was 97 pmol/106 cells (average of two
determinations), a value comparable with that reported by
haycock et al. [16]. in contrast, the levels of labelled dopa and
dopamine were very low.
when the cells were incubated with ['4c]phenylalanine, a
linear increase in [14c]tyrosine was observed, but with a
pronounced lag phase in the labelling of catecholamines (fig.
2b). however, after 15-30 min, the rate of adrenaline labelling
was about 50 % of that observed with [3h]tyrosine as the

2.2 mm-cacl2, 0.8 mm-mgci2 and 5 mm-glucose, with shaking in

removed at the times noted and added to 0.5 ml of ice-cold medium.
the cells were centrifuged at 1000 g for 30 s and then resuspended
in 0.5 ml of 3 0 (w/w) hcio4. quantification of the labelled noradrenaline (-) and adrenaline (-) was corrected for the loss of half
of the label as a result of hydroxylation in the 3-position. (b) cells

with both phenylalanine (fig. 3) and tyrosine (results not shown)
as the substrate. formation of labelled hydroxylated products
did not occur in experiments with boiled cells (results not shown)
or with fresh cells incubated with 20 gum-a- xxxd2634xxx 

(fig. 3).
studies on purified  xxxg2276xxx 
since  xxxg1660xxx  has not been demonstrated in
adrenal medulla [18], we conclude that the hydroxylation of
phenylalanine in these cells is catalysed by  xxxg2276xxx .
studies on the isolated purified enzyme confirmed this conclusion
(fig. 4a). thus, when the enzyme was incubated with
0.2 mm-phenylalanine, catalase and cofactor, and the incubation
mixture was analysed for products as a function of time, dopa,
 xxxd3459xxx  and a small amount of l-m-tyrosine were formed
(fig. 4a). control incubations without added enzyme contained
no hydroxylated products. the apparent km value for lphenylalanine was 0.06 mm (0.04 mm for  xxxd3459xxx ) and the v
was 1.05 times that with  xxxd3459xxx  as the substrate.

hydroxylation of l-m-tyrosine
when dl-m-tyrosine was used as substrate, significant amounts
of dopa were formed (fig. 4b). since the possibility remained
that m-tyrosine was a preferred substrate for  xxxg2276xxx 
because it did not accumulate to a significant degree in cells, the
d- and l-isomers were isolated and studied as substrates. d-mtyrosine was not hydroxylated by the enzyme, whereas l-mtyrosine was slowly converted into dopa, with an apparent km
of about 0.8 mm at ph 7.2.
discussion
the studies reported here show that phenylalanine can be
converted into catecholamines in intact bovine adrenal
chromaffin cells, by a hydroxylation reaction catalysed by
 xxxg2276xxx , since  xxxg1660xxx  has not
been found in this tissue 118]. the ability of  xxxg2276xxx

the enzyme activity was assayed by incubation of 0.2 mm substrate
with 1 mm-(6r)-(l)- xxxd2033xxx -tetrahydrobiopterin, 0.1 mg of catalase/
ml, i mm-dithiothreitol, 20 mm-hepes, ph 7.2, and 16 ,ug of purified
enzyme protein/ml. then 0.1 ml samples were added to an equal
volume of 60 hcio4 on ice. k2co3-neutralized supernatants were
analysed by h.p;l.c. as described in the materials and methods
section. (a) l-phenylalanine (200 /um) was used as substrate and the
products measured were l-m-tyrosine (a),  xxxd3459xxx  (0) and ldopa (a). (b) dl-m-tyrosine (200 ,m) was used as substrate and
the measured product was l-dopa (a).

to hydroxylate phenylalanine has been reported previously [1-5],
but for some reason the results on partially purified tyrosine
hydroxylase [1-4] have not been widely accepted, perhaps because
of reports on non-enzymic conversion of phenylalanine into
tyrosine under certain reaction conditions [6,7], as well as
enzymically catalysed formation of some m-tyrosine, which was
shown not to be a substrate for the enzyme [8]. reports on
 xxxg2276xxx  isolated from rat pheochromocytoma
(pc12) cells by two separate groups claimed that phenylalanine
was not hydroxylated by their enzyme preparations [10,11], even
under conditions in which 'one turnover event per enzyme
molecule could be detected' [10].
however, in our laboratory the bovine adrenal enzyme purified
to homogeneity and with a specific activity of more than 400 nmol
of dopa/min per mg of protein was found to hydroxylate l-

phenylalanine and form the cofactor product 4a-hydroxytetrahydropterin almost as efficiently as with  xxxd3459xxx  [12]. with
the longer incubation periods used in the present study, the
subsequent hydroxylation of the tyrosine formed from phenylalanine to dopa was also observed (fig. 4). furthermore,
 xxxg2276xxx  isolated from rat pheochromocytoma also
hydroxylated l-phenylalanine to  xxxd3459xxx  and dopa in our
standard incubation system (k. k. andersson, unpublished
work). catalase was included in the assay to prevent the nonenzymic conversion of phenylalanine into tyrosine, which occurs
in the presence of cofactor and dioxygen [6,7]; product formation
was completely dependent on the presence of enzyme.
that the hydroxylation of phenylalanine is not a reaction
limited to the highly purified enzyme, e.g. owing to a change in
substrate specificity as a result of its isolation, is clear from the
present studies on intact bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. l[14c]phenylalanine was incorporated into catecholamines at a
rate which was about one-third of that with l-tyrosine. the
increased cellular levels of labelled l-tyrosine (fig. 2a), but not
of l-dopa (results not shown), are consistent with the role of
 xxxg2276xxx  as the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine
biosynthesis. in fact, the hydroxylation of two consecutive
substrates, l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine, by the rate-limiting
enzyme in a pathway would decrease the overall flux, as shown
by the accumulation of tyrosine, although the substrates tyrosine
and phenylalanine have comparable kinetic constants in the
 xxxg2276xxx -catalysed reaction. the tyrosine accumulation itself could also inhibit the flux directly, since the
hydroxylase is known to be inhibited by high concentrations of
its substrate [19]. thus we have confirmed the observations by
ikeda et al. [2], reporting that formation of dopa, but not of
tyrosine, from phenylalanine was inhibited by high substrate
concentrations. the stimulatory effect of carbachol on the rate of
catecholamine labelling is probably due to activation of tyrosine
hydroxylase by phosphorylation. using labelled tyrosine as the
substrate, haycock et al. [16] have similarly shown that tyrosine
hydroxylase in chromaffin cells is activated (and phosphorylated)
by stimulation with acetylcholine.
physiological implications
the physiological significance or biological advantage of the
ability of  xxxg2276xxx  to use these two substrates is not
obvious from these mechanisms which seem to operate in
hyperphenylalaninaemia. thus phenylalanine in high concentrations as seen in hyperphenylalaninaemia probably acts
as a competitive substrate for  xxxg2276xxx , with the net
result of decreasing the availability of the enzyme for tyrosine
and decreasing the rate of catecholamine biosynthesis. however,
it has been suggested that the intraneuronal hydroxylation of
phenylalanine by  xxxg2276xxx  is important for normal

protein synthesis [20]. that  xxxg2276xxx  can provide all
the tyrosine needed for cell growth is illustrated by the ability of
certain cell lines expressing that enzyme to grow in tyrosine-free
media [21]. in fact, the capacity to grow in tyrosine-free medium
has recently been used as a criterion for successful transfection of
human  xxxg2276xxx  cdna into various cell lines [22].
