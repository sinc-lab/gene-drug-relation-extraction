abstract: a barrier to heterologous production of complex polyketides in escherichia coli is the lack of
(2s)-methylmalonyl-coa, a common extender substrate for the biosynthesis of complex polyketides by
modular polyketide synthases. one biosynthetic route to (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa involves the sequential
actions of two enzymes,  xxxg1485xxx  and methylmalonyl-coa epimerase, which convert
succinyl-coa to (2r)- and then to (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa. as reported [mckie, n., et al. (1990) biochem.
j. 269, 293-298; haller, t., et al. (2000) biochemistry 39, 4622-4629], when genes encoding coenzyme
b12-dependent methylmalonyl-coa mutases were expressed in e. coli, the inactive apo-enzyme was
produced. however, when cells harboring the mutase genes from propionibacterium shermanii or e. coli
were treated with the b12 precursor  xxxd2300xxx , active holo-enzyme was isolated, and (2r)methylmalonyl-coa represented ∼10% of the intracellular coa pool. when the e. coli  xxxg243xxx  cell line

 xxxg1485xxx , streptomyces coelicolor methylmalonyl-coa epimerase, and the polyketide
synthase debs (6-deoxyerythronolide b synthase) was fed propionate and  xxxd2300xxx , the
polyketide 6-deoxyerythronolide b (6-deb) was produced. isotopic labeling studies using [13c]propionate
showed that the starter unit for polyketide synthesis was derived exclusively from exogenous propionate,
while the extender units stemmed from methylmalonyl-coa via the mutase-epimerase pathway. thus,
the introduction of an engineered mutase-epimerase pathway in e. coli enabled the uncoupling of carbon
sources used to produce starter and extender units of polyketides.

polyketides are complex natural products that are particularly abundant in soil microorganisms (1). although fewer
than 10 000 polyketides have been identified to date, they
include a large number of major pharmaceuticals that span
a broad range of therapeutic areas, including cancer (adriamycin), infectious disease (tetracyclines, erythromycin),
cardiovascular (mevacor, lovastatin), and immunosuppression
(rapamycin, tacrolimus).
complex polyketides are produced by modular polyketide
synthases (pkss)1slarge, multifunctional enzymes that are
organized into multiple catalytic “modules”, each containing

a set of 3-6 functional domains that determine the identity
of a 2-carbon unit of the polyketide. as illustrated in figure
1 for the prototypical deoxyerythronolide b synthase (debs)
(2), modules are linearly arranged, beginning with a starter
module, followed by a number of extender modules, and
terminating with a releasing domain. each of the modules
recognizes the acyl group of a specific acyl-coa, catalyzes
its condensation with an acyl-group tethered to the preceding
module to form a nascent polyketide chain, and modifies
the beta-carbon atom of the growing chain. this extension/
modification process occurs in an assembly line fashion
through the entire sequence of modules, resulting in a oneto-one correlation between the constituent enzymatic activities of a pks module and the corresponding 2-carbon ketide
unit of a polyketide.
owing to the modular nature of polyketide synthesis,
genetic engineering can be used to create specific structural
modifications of polyketides in a predictable fashion and to
produce new libraries of these natural products. in theory,
by modifying the genes that encode pks modules, a specific
2-carbon unit of a polyketide may be changed to one of about
20 others, reflecting the combinations of chain extender units
(malonate, methylmalonate, or rarer units), the fate of the
incoming beta-keto group at each step of chain extension (keto,
hydroxyl, enoyl, or methylene), and the stereochemistry of
methyl and hydroxyl branches. in practice, such modifications are complicated by several factors, including the facts

that most natural polyketide producers grow slowly, are
poorly transformed by dna, and are often intractable toward
genetic manipulations. to exploit the molecular biological
tools available in genetically “friendly” organisms, we are
developing escherichia coli as a general host for polyketide
manipulation and production.
heterologous production of polyketides in e. coli is
problematic because of the lack of needed acyl-coa precursors. for example, the erythromycin pks debs requires
propionyl-coa as a starter unit and (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa
as an extender unit, neither of which is found in e. coli (3).
recently, however, e. coli was engineered to produce these
metabolic intermediates (4). propionyl-coa was produced
by propionate feeding of cells disrupted in propionyl-coa
catabolism and overexpressing propionyl-coa ligase, the
product of the prpe gene (5). in addition to providing the
starter unit, propionyl-coa served as a source of the extender
unit, (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa, via the coexpressed propionyl-coa carboxylase (pcc). the metabolically engineered
host supported the synthesis of a full-length polyketide (6deb), or alternatively a truncated triketide lactone (tkl)
when only the starter and the first two extender modules of
the pks (debs1 + te) were expressed (figure 1).
in the present work, we describe the introduction into e.
coli of the coenzyme b12-dependent methylmalonyl-coa
mutase-epimerase pathway (6-8) (figure 2), an important
pathway for production of methylmalonyl-coa in the
polyketide-producing actinomycetes (9, 10). in contrast to
the pcc pathway, in which both the starter and extender
units stem from propionyl-coa, the mutase pathway produces the (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa extender unit from the
tca cycle intermediate, succinyl-coa. thus, the polyketide
extender unit is provided independently of the starter unit,
making separate optimization feasible.

were from stratagene, and e. coli sj16 (cgsc #6341) (12)
was from the e. coli genetic stock center, yale university.
the expression vectors pet-22b(+) and pet-16b were from

reserve university.  xxxg243xxx  e. coli and plasmids pbp12,
pbp130, and pbp144 are described in pfeifer et al. (4). strain
k173-145, a pand version of  xxxg243xxx , and plasmid pkos173158, a modified version of pbp144 in which the pcc genes
were removed, were provided by jonathan kennedy, kosan
biosciences (unpublished results). dna sequencing was
performed using a beckman ceq 2000 capillary sequencer.
mut medium consisted of m9 salts, glucose, thiamin, trace
elements, and amino acids (14). protease inhibitor cocktail
tablets (complete, mini, edta-free) were obtained from
roche molecular biochemicals. [3-3h]beta-alanine (50 ci/
mmol) and [1-14c]propionate (56 mci/mmol) were from
american radiolabeled chemicals. [13c3]propionate (99
atom %) was obtained from aldrich. all other reagents were
the purest available from commercial sources. standard
molecular biology techniques were as described (15). one
unit (u) of enzyme activity is the amount of enzyme required
for production of 1 µmol of product per minute.
e. coli bl21(de3)/pand. e. coli sj16 containing tn10
(tetr) linked to pand was infected with p1 phage, and the
lysate was used to infect e. coli bl21(de3) (13). following
selection for tetr colonies, a strain (k117-60) was isolated
that displayed a reduction in growth on mut medium, and a
∼10-fold increase in incorporation of [3h]beta-alanine into acylcoas.
construction of  xxxg1485xxx  expression
vector. the translationally coupled muta and mutb genes,
encoding the beta and r  xxxg1485xxx  subunits
[originally identified and sequenced by leadlay and coworkers (6)], were amplified from p. shermanii genomic
dna by pcr in four fragments that were then joined. the
pcr primers for the first fragment, muta1, were 5′-cac
agt cta gac ata tga gca gca cgg atc agg
gga cc-3′, containing introduced xbai and ndei sites
(boldface type), and 5′-cac agc tgc agg gct  xxxg873xxx 
aac  xxxg873xxx  atg gga tcc-3′, containing a natural psti
site (italics). for muta2, the primers were 5′-cac agc tgc
agg gca ccg agc cgg atc tga cc-3′ (natural psti
site, italics) and 5′-cac aga agc ttg ata tca agg
 xxxg889xxx  gag gac-3′, introducing a hindiii site (boldface) at
the 3′ end, adjacent to the naturally occurring ecorv site
(italics). in the mutb1 fragment, the start codon for the mutb
gene was changed from  xxxg889xxx  to atg (7) using the pcr
primer 5′-cac aga cta  xxxg889xxx  ata tct tgg gag tcg
cga aat gag cac tct gcc ccg ttt tga ttc-3′,
which also introduced a spei site (boldface) upstream of the
natural ecorv site (italics). the reverse primer for this
fragment was 5′-cac agc tgc agg aac agc tgg
 xxxg889xxx  tta cgg  xxxg873xxx  atg c-3′, containing a natural psti
site (italics). the primers for the mutb2 fragment were 5′cac agc tgc agc agg aat cgg gca cga cgc

agc ttc aat tgc tag gca tcg agc gaa gcc
c-3′, introducing mfei and hindiii sites (boldface) near the
3′ end of the fragment. each fragment was cloned into an
intermediate bluescript vector and sequenced. the fragments
were excised from the intermediate vectors and pieced
together: naturally occurring psti sites were used to join
muta1 and muta2 (muta), as well as mutb1 and mutb2
(mutb). the muta and mutb fragments were combined at a
naturally occurring ecorv site to form the complete mutase

the restriction sites ndei and hindiii, to form pkos11695b.
expression of p. shermanii holo-methylmalonyl-coa
mutase. operations were performed in a dark room with a
safelight. a foil-wrapped 125 ml flask containing 25 ml
of mut medium, 100 µg/ml carbenicillin, 5 µm beta-alanine,
and 5 µm  xxxd2300xxx  was inoculated with 250 µl
of a starter culture of k117-60/pkos116-95b (mutab),
which was grown at 27 °c for 20 h in the above medium,
excluding  xxxd2300xxx . after incubating overnight at
27 °c, cultures were induced with iptg to 1 mm final
concentration and incubated for an additional 5 h. cells were
transferred to a foil-wrapped conical tube, collected by
centrifugation, and stored in the dark at -80 °c. for soluble
extract preparation, the pellet was thawed, washed with buffer
c (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, 5 mm
edta, 10% glycerol, 1 protease inhibitor tablet per 10 ml
of buffer), and resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer c. following
sonication on ice, the extract was clarified by centrifugation.
cloning and expression of e. coli sbm. the gene for sbm
(sleeping beauty mutase) was amplified by pcr from e.
coli k117-60 genomic dna and cloned into pet-16b to
introduce an n-terminal his10-tag (pkos143-49-2), as
described (16). the gene was also cloned as an ndei/saci
fragment into pet-22b (pkos143-40-39) to encode the
native sbm sequence. cultures of k117-60/pkos143-49-2
(his10-sbm) were grown in lb with 100 µg/ml carbenicillin
at 37 °c. at late-log phase, the cultures were induced with
iptg to 1 mm final concentration and grown for an
additional 18 h at 22 °c. the cells were collected by
centrifugation, and his10-sbm was purified by metal chelate
chromatography (as specified by qiagen). no attempt was
made to purify native sbm.
acyl-coa analysis. hplc was performed using a 150 ×
4.6 mm 5 µm ods-3 inertsil hplc column (metachem
technologies). hplc buffer a contained 100 mm nah2po4, 75 mm naoac, ph 4.6, and buffer b contained 70%
buffer a, 30% methanol. the hplc column was equilibrated
with 90% buffer a/10% buffer b at a flow rate of 1 ml/
min. after sample injection, a linear gradient to 40% buffer
b was formed over 35 min, followed by a linear gradient to
90% buffer b over 20 min; the eluant was monitored at 260
nm. for radioactive samples, 0.5 ml fractions were collected
from 18 to 58 min, and the samples were counted in a liquid
scintillation counter. the coa standard mix contained 0.5
mm coa and 1.6 mm each of malonyl-, methylmalonyl-,
succinyl-, acetyl-, and propionyl-coa.
analysis of intracellular acyl-coas. mut medium (1 ml)
containing 100 µg/ml carbenicillin and 100 µm beta-alanine
was inoculated with single colonies of k117-60 harboring
various mutase genes (pkos116-95b, pkos143-49-2, or
pkos143-40-39) or the vector control pet-22b. after
overnight growth at 37 °c, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed 4 times with 1 ml of mut medium. the
cells were suspended in 1 ml of mut medium containing
100 µg of carbenicillin, and grown for 4 h at 37 °c to deplete
cells of beta-alanine. fresh mut medium (1 ml) containing 10
µci of [3h]beta-alanine, 0.5 µm beta-alanine, and 100 µg/ml
carbenicillin was inoculated with 30 µl of the starved cells.
after 3 h of growth at 37 °c, iptg was added to each culture
to a final concentration of 1 mm. the culture tubes were

5196 biochemistry, vol. 41, no. 16, 2002
wrapped in aluminum foil,  xxxd2300xxx  was added to
5 µm final concentration, and the cultures were incubated
at 27 °c overnight. cells were collected by centrifugation
and washed twice with 1 ml of mut medium. the washed
cell pellet was resuspended in 300 µl of cold 10% tca
containing 5 µl of coa standard mix, and the suspension
was sonicated on ice for 1 min at 5 w. precipitants were
removed by centrifugation, and 50 µl of the supernatant was
analyzed for acyl-coas by hplc as described above.
 xxxg1485xxx  assay. all operations for the
mutase assay were performed in the dark or under a safelight.
enzyme assays (100 µl) contained 0.2 mm (2rs)-methylmalonyl-coa and mutase extract in buffer c. for assays
containing added coenzyme b12, the mutase extract was
preincubated with 0.01 mm coenzyme b12 in 75 µl of buffer
c for 5 min at 30 °c for mutab, or for 1 h at 4 °c with 2
mm dithiothreitol (16) for his10-sbm. (2rs)-methylmalonylcoa was added, and after incubation at 30 °c for 2, 5, 10,
or 20 min, reactions were quenched with 50 µl of 10% tca
and placed on ice for 10 min. after centrifugation, 100 µl
of the supernatant was analyzed by hplc to quantify
conversion of methylmalonyl-coa to succinyl-coa.
his10-sbm was also assayed to determine which diastereomer of methylmalonyl-coa it produced. reaction mixtures (50 µl) contained 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer,
ph 6.9, 0.1 m nh4so4, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 2.4 mm
succinyl-coa, 0.0033 unit of transcarboxylase, and purified
his10-sbm, with and without methylmalonyl-coa epimerase.
reactions were initiated with succinyl-coa, incubated in the
dark at 30 °c for 10 min, and quenched as described above.
supernatants were analyzed by the hplc system described
above, which separated succinyl-coa, methylmalonyl-coa,
and propionyl-coa.
methylmalonyl-coa epimerase assay. enzyme activity
was assayed at 30 °c using a modification of a reported
method (8). the epimerase (0.54 mg/ml) was first activated
with 100 µm cocl2 at 4 °c for 1 h. reaction mixtures (1.5
ml) contained 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, ph 6.9,
0.1 m nh4so4, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.08 mm (2rs)methylmalonyl-coa, 0.05 unit of transcarboxylase, 0.16 mm
nadh, and 2.5 units of  xxxg1739xxx . the reaction
was initiated with (2rs)-methylmalonyl-coa, and the decrease in a340 concomitant with consumption of the s-isomer
was allowed to stabilize. limiting epimerase was added to
catalyze conversion of the remaining r- to s-isomer, and
the initial rate and total decrease in a340 were monitored.
for kinetic studies, ∼1.2 nm epimerase was incubated with
varying amounts of (2rs)-methylmalonyl-coa (27-160
µm). the (2r)-methylmalonyl-coa concentrations were
assumed to be half of the concentration of (2rs)-methylmalonyl-coa.
n-terminal sequencing of methylmalonyl-coa epimerase
from p. shermanii. a 10 l fermentation of p. shermanii was
grown anaerobically at ph 6.85 (11). after 3 days, cells were
collected by centrifugation, washed with water, and stored
at -80 °c. methylmalonyl-coa epimerase was purified as
described (8), followed by c-8 reversed-phase hplc (17).
the hplc-purified epimerase was subjected to n-terminal
amino acid sequencing, and also digested with 0.4 µg of
achromobacter lyticus protease (lys-c) in 125 mm tris/
hcl, ph 8, 3.8 mm dtt for 16 h at 37 °c. the lys-c
peptides were separated by hplc, and those showing 280

dayem et al.
nm tryptophan absorbance were sequenced. we obtained 41
residues of the n-terminal sequence, and 6 residues of a
lys-c peptide.
p. shermanii methylmalonyl-coa epimerase gene. a
cosmid library of p. shermanii was prepared as described
(stratagene). degenerate pcr primers were designed based
on the n-terminus and internal peptide sequences of the
epimerase. the forward primer was 5′-cacagtctagaathgaycaygtngcntaygc-3′, and the reverse
primer was 5′-cacagggatccytcrtcrttnarnggngcytt-3′, where the underlined sequences target the
epimerase gene and the boldface type shows introduced xbai
(forward primer) and bamhi (reverse primer) restriction sites.
these primers were used to pcr-amplify from p. shermanii
genomic dna a 190 base pair fragment, which was used as
a template to generate a digoxigenin (dig)-labeled probe
via pcr (boehringer mannheim). the labeled pcr product
was used to probe the cosmid library by colony hybridization.
cosmids from positive colonies were screened for the
epimerase gene by pcr, and several were subjected to dna
sequencing using primers specific to the epimerase sequence.
the cosmid designated pkos117-167-a7 contained the
complete epimerase gene, the sequence of which has been
deposited into the genbank database under accession number
ay046899.
the epimerase gene was amplified from pkos117-167a7 by pcr, using primers that introduced ndei and bamhi
restriction sites at the 5′ end, and nhei and avrii sites at the
3′ end. the forward primer also destroyed a natural ndei
site at nucleotides 41-46. the pcr product was cloned into
an intermediate vector for sequencing, and then into the
vector pkos116-63 between ndei and nhei sites, to give
pkos143-28-8.
s. coelicolor methylmalonyl-coa epimerase gene. the
p. shermanii methylmalonyl-coa epimerase dna sequence
was used to search the s. coelicolor genomic database
(www.sanger.ac.uk/projects/s•coelicolor) using the blast
programs at the national center for biotechnology information, nih website (18), and s. coelicolor gene 8f4.02c was
identified as a putative methylmalonyl-coa epimerase. the
gene was amplified by pcr from s. coelicolor genomic
dna, using the forward primer 5′-cac agc ata tgc
tga cgc gaa tcg acc-3′, which introduced a ndei
site at the 5′ end, and the reverse primer, 5′-cac aga tgc
att cag tgc tca ggt gac tca acg g-3′, which
introduced an nsii site at the 3′ end. the pcr fragment was
cloned into an intermediate vector and sequenced, and then
into the vector pkos116-63 between the restriction sites
ndei and nsii, to give pkos117-174-a37.
heterologous expression and purification of the epimerases. e. coli bl21(de3) harboring either pkos143-28-8
(p. shermanii epimerase) or pkos117-174-a37 (s. coelicolor epimerase) was grown in 750 ml of lb (100 µg/ml
carbenicillin) at 37 °c until late-log phase, then induced with
iptg to 1 mm final concentration, and grown for an
additional 3 h at 30 °c. the cells were collected by
centrifugation, and the pellets were stored at -80 °c. the
recombinant epimerase proteins were purified essentially as
described for p. shermanii (8).
coexpression of p. shermanii mutase and epimerase
genes. the methylmalonyl-coa epimerase gene from p.
shermanii was cloned as an ndei/avrii fragment downstream

complex polyketide biosynthesis in engineered e. coli
of a t7 promoter in pkos116-172a. the epimerase gene
was excised along with the t7 promoter from pkos116172a as a paci/nhei fragment and cloned into pkos1339b, a pet plasmid containing paci-nhei sites directly
downstream of the mutab genes, and followed by a t7
transcriptional terminator. this provided pkos143-35-50
with the configuration: [t7 promoter-mutab genes]-[t7
promoter-epimerase gene]-[t7 terminator]. the mutab and
epimerase genes were also cloned in the same configuration
into a tetracycline-resistant pacyc vector containing atoc
to create pkos207-15a (sumati murli, unpublished results).
tkl analysis. e. coli  xxxg243xxx  was transformed with pbp12
(debs1+te) and either pkos143-35-50 (mutab/epimerase) or pkos116-95b (mutab). individual transformants
were inoculated into mut medium with 100 µg/ml carbenicillin and 50 µg/ml kanamycin, and the cultures were
grown at 37 °c. upon reaching late-log phase, the cultures
were cooled at 22 °c for 3 min and centrifuged. the cell
pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of the supernatant, 10 µci
of [14c]propionate was added, and  xxxd2300xxx  and
iptg were added in the dark at final concentrations of 5
µm and 0.5 mm, respectively. the cultures were incubated
in the dark at 22 °c for up to 43 h. samples (100 µl) were
removed from the cultures periodically, and supernatants
were extracted twice with 300 µl of ethyl acetate. the extract
was dried in vacuo and subjected to tlc analysis. radioactive spots comigrating with authentic tkl were quantitated
on a phosphorimager, and tkl concentrations were calculated using a standard curve of [14c]propionate. negative
controls included cultures of  xxxg243xxx /pbp12 (debs1+te
only) and  xxxg243xxx /pbp12/pkos143-35-50 (debs1+te and
mutab/epimerase) without  xxxd2300xxx .
6-deb analysis. lb medium (10 ml) was inoculated with
e. coli strain k173-145 containing plasmids pkos173-158
(debs1), pbp130 (debs2,3), and pkos207-15a (mutab/
epimerase). as an alternative for the mutase-epimerase
pathway, pkos207-15a was substituted by pkos143-189,
a tetracycline-resistant pacyc vector containing the pcc
genes behind a t7 promoter (sumati murli, unpublished
results). cultures were grown at 37 °c in lb medium with
100 µg/ml carbenicillin, 7.5 µg/ml tetracycline, and 50 µg/
ml kanamycin. upon reaching late-log phase, cultures were
chilled on ice, either 5 mm propionate or 5 mm [13c3]propionate was added, and the cultures were induced with
iptg to 0.5 mm final concentration.  xxxd2300xxx ,
succinate, and glutamate, to final concentrations of 5 µm,
50 mm, and 50 mm, respectively, were added to strains
containing the mutase. the cultures were grown for 40 h at
22 °c; cells were collected by centrifugation, and the cellfree medium was extracted with an equal volume of etoac.
the etoac extract (8 ml) was dried and resuspended in
meoh.
extracts were analyzed by lc-ms on a system comprised
of an agilent 1100 hplc and an applied biosystems

results
pcr amplification and expression of active  xxxg1485xxx . the translationally coupled genes (mutab) for the r- and beta- subunits of methylmalonyl-coa
mutase ( xxxg1344xxx .2) were amplified from p. shermanii
genomic dna, cloned, and sequenced. there were two
discrepancies between the amino acid sequence predicted
from the genes obtained here and the sequence reported in
the database (accession no. x14965); we found g990c991
instead of c990g991, corresponding to glu330leu331 rather than
asp330val331. since our residue assignments corresponded
with those in the crystallographic structure of the protein
(19), we concluded that they are correct. to facilitate
expression in e. coli, the naturally occurring  xxxg889xxx  start codon
for mutb was changed to atg (7, 14), and the mutab genes
were subcloned into an e. coli expression vector under the
control of a t7 promoter.
we grew e. coli k117-60 harboring pkos116-95b, a pet
vector containing the p. shermanii mutase genes, at 27 °c
in the defined mut medium with and without  xxxd2300xxx  (14). mutase activity in cell extracts was monitored
by the conversion of (2r)-methylmalonyl-coa to succinylcoa by hplc. as reported (7), in the absence of  xxxd2300xxx , mutase activity was undetectable unless extracts
were supplemented with coenzyme b12, indicating exclusive
expression of the apo-enzyme. however, when expression
of the mutase was induced in cells grown in the presence of
 xxxd2300xxx , 0.038 unit/mg of mutase activity was
observed in crude extracts. no succinyl-coa formation was
observed when (2rs)-methylmalonyl-coa was incubated
with extracts from strain k117-60 harboring the pet vector
control.
the gene (sbm) for e. coli  xxxg1485xxx 
was cloned downstream of a t7 promoter with a his10-tag,
expressed in e. coli, purified, and reconstituted with coenzyme b12. as reported (16), the reconstituted enzyme
catalyzed the production of succinyl-coa when incubated
with (2rs)-methylmalonyl-coa. to determine which isomer
of methylmalonyl-coa was used as the substrate, his10-sbm
was incubated with succinyl-coa to produce methylmalonylcoa, as well as with sodium pyruvate and transcarboxylase,
which converts the (2s)- but not the (2r)-isomer to propionyl-coa. hplc analysis revealed that propionyl-coa was
not produced. however, when p. shermanii epimerase was
added to the assay mixture to interconvert (2r)- and (2s)methylmalonyl-coa, propionyl-coa was produced. this
demonstrated that, as with other methylmalonyl-coa mutases, sbm catalyzes the stereospecific conversion of succinyl-coa to (2r)-methylmalonyl-coa.

production of methylmalonyl-coa in e. coli. analysis of
in vivo acyl-coa pools is typically accomplished in e. coli
strains deficient in the enzyme aspartate decarboxylase
(pand), which converts aspartate to beta-alanine, a component
of coa. such strains are “fed” [3h]beta-alanine, which is
incorporated into coa without isotopic dilution. the 3hlabeled acyl-coas in crude lysates are separated by hplc
and analyzed by scintillation counting (12). to express the
mutase in a pand background, we constructed a bl21(de3)/
pand strain (k117-60) by phage p1 transduction of the pand
locus from sj16 to bl21(de3) (12). the resulting pand
strain enabled detection of intracellular acyl-coa pools at
about 10-fold greater sensitivity compared with wild-type
strains.
cultures of e. coli k117-60 harboring various  xxxg1485xxx  genes or the vector control pet were
grown and induced in mut medium containing [3h]beta-alanine
with and without  xxxd2300xxx . cells were lysed and
extracts applied to an hplc system along with coa
standards. figure 3 shows in vivo acyl-coa levels in cells
with and without the p. shermanii mutab. in cells expressing
mutab and grown with  xxxd2300xxx , methylmalonylcoa comprised ∼10% of the coa pool, whereas in the
cultures without mutab and/or  xxxd2300xxx , methylmalonyl-coa was not detected. similar levels of methylmalonyl-coa were observed in cells grown with  xxxd2300xxx  and overexpressing sbm and his10-sbm (data not
shown). it has been reported that sbm retained only 7% of
its in vitro activity after cleavage of the n-terminal his10tag (16). however, we found that both versions of sbm
produced similar amounts of methylmalonyl-coa in vivo.
with the exception of methylmalonyl-coa, the acyl-coa
pool composition was comparable to that observed for e.
coli pand mutants grown on glucose (3). however, in cells
overexpressing mutab, malonyl-coa levels were consistently elevated. in this minimal medium, we did not observe
propionyl-coa.
methylmalonyl-coa epimerases. methylmalonyl-coa epimerase (ec 5.1.99.1) from p. shermanii was purified to
homogeneity; peptide sequences were obtained and used to
design degenerate pcr primers. a dig-labeled probe was

amplified by pcr and used to isolate the complete 447 bp
epimerase gene from a p. shermanii cosmid library via
colony hybridization. the predicted protein sequence of the
p. shermanii epimerase was used to identify a putative
methylmalonyl-coa epimerase from the s. coelicolor genomic database; the two sequences are ∼44% identical and
∼64% similar. the genes for both epimerases were cloned
into e. coli expression vectors, and the proteins were purified
to homogeneity. we also cloned the bacillus subtilus yqjc,
identified as a putative methylmalonyl-coa epimerase gene
(16), into a pet expression vector containing a t7 promoter.
however, the protein was expressed in e. coli as insoluble
particles and not studied further.
the calculated molecular masses of the epimerases are
16 716 da for p. shermanii and 16 081 da for s. coelicolor.
sds-page analysis of the purified p. shermanii epimerase
revealed a band at molecular mass ∼23 kda; however, esitof mass spectrometry confirmed the expected molecular
mass of 16.7 kda. the s. coelicolor epimerase had a
molecular mass of 16.1 kda by esi-tof mass spectrometry,
and migrated on sds-page as a band of molecular mass

production of complex polyketides via the mutase route.
the gene encoding the methylmalonyl-coa epimerase from
p. shermanii was cloned under the control of a t7 promoter
downstream of the mutab genes, yielding the expression
plasmid pkos143-35-50. analysis by sds-page of
soluble protein from induced e. coli cells harboring the
mutab and epimerase genes showed that muta, mutb, and
the epimerase were overexpressed (figure 4). to test the
ability of the p. shermanii  xxxg1485xxx  and
epimerase to support polyketide biosynthesis in vivo, the
recently described  xxxg243xxx  e. coli cell line was transformed
with pbp12 (debs1+te) (4) and either pkos143-35-50
(mutab-epimerase) or pkos116-95b (mutab). the strains
were grown in a minimal medium containing [14c]propionate
and  xxxd2300xxx . following iptg induction, the
cultures were sampled and evaluated by tlc to show that
coexpression of mutab and epimerase in the  xxxg243xxx  cell line
resulted in production of the truncated polyketide tkl (data
not shown). in a control experiment omitting the epimerase
gene, no tkl was detected; this is in accord with previous

work demonstrating that (2r)-methylmalonyl-coa is not a
substrate for debs1+te (20, 21).
having demonstrated that the (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa
supplied via the engineered mutase-epimerase pathway
supported synthesis of a triketide, we sought to produce the
full-length polyketide, 6-deb, and to show that the polyketide
starter and extender units were derived from separate sources.
the cell line k173-145 ( xxxg243xxx /pand) was transformed with
the genes encoding debs (pkos173-158 and pbp130) and
either the mutase-epimerase genes (pkos207-15a) or the
pcc genes (pkos143-189) (figure 2). cultures were
supplemented with propionate, and following ethyl acetate
extraction, the 6-deb in supernatants was analyzed by lc/
ms. in numerous experiments, average 6-deb titers for this
system were ∼1 mg/l for the mutase-epimerase pathway
and ∼10 mg/l for the pcc pathway (unpublished results).
the origins of the carbon atoms were determined by lc/
ms analysis of the 6-deb product formed upon feeding
propionate or [13c3]propionate. the mass spectrum of the
6-deb produced when propionate was fed to the strain
containing the mutase-epimerase pathway is shown in
figure 5a. when [13c3]propionate was fed to the same strain,
all ions were shifted up by exactly 3 mass units (figure 5b
versus figure 5a), indicating that 1 mol of exogenous
propionate was incorporated per mole of 6-deb. considering
the metabolic pathways engineered into the system, it was
deduced that the [13c3]propionate was incorporated only as
a starter unit and not as an extender unit. as expected for
the pcc pathway, [13c3]propionate was incorporated at all
21 carbons of 6-deb (figure 5c). under these conditions,
14-desmethyl 6-deb was not observed, demonstrating that
acetyl-coa was not used as a starter unit for debs.
discussion
production of polyketides in heterologous hosts requires
pks expression, posttranslational phosphopantetheinylation
(22), and a supply of appropriate acyl-coa precursors
including acetyl-, malonyl-, propionyl-, and (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa. whereas acetyl- and malonyl-coas are ubiquitous metabolic intermediates (they are essential for fatty acid
biosynthesis), propionyl- and (2s)-methylmalonyl-coas are
not. recently, e. coli was engineered to produce and
accumulate sufficient propionyl- and (2s)-methylmalonylcoa to support complex polyketide biosynthesis (4). for
propionyl-coa accumulation, its catabolism was inhibited
by interruption of the prp operon, and prpe was placed under
independent control of a t7 promoter. for (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa production, heterologous propionyl-coa carboxylase (pcc) genes were introduced. in this system,
propionyl-coa served as the source of both starter and
extender substrates for polyketide biosynthesis.
in the present work, we introduced the methylmalonylcoa mutase-epimerase pathway into e. coli. this pathway
converts tca cycle-derived succinyl-coa to (2r)-methylmalonyl-coa, which is then epimerized to the pks extender
substrate, (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa (figure 2). the  xxxg1485xxx -epimerase pathway provides several
potential advantages over the pcc pathway for production
of polyketides. first, if a starter acyl-coa is not supplied,
(2s)-methylmalonyl-coa could potentially yield propionylcoa through decarboxylation by expression of a known

figure 5: lc-ms spectra comparing (a) unlabeled, (b) partially
labeled, and (c) fully labeled 6-deb produced via the mutaseepimerase pathway with (a) propionate or (b) [13c3]propionate, and
(c) via the pcc pathway with [13c3]propionate. the mass spectrum
of unlabeled 6-deb consists primarily of ions due to [m+na]+
(409.3), [m+h-h2o]+ (369.3), [m+h-2h2o]+ (351.3), and a 15
carbon fragment (c15h27o2) that includes the carbons of the
propionate starter unit (239.2); a pseudo-molecular ion [m+h]+ is
rarely observed. 6-deb titers in this experiment (average of 2
samples) were (a) 0.73 mg/l, (b) 0.8 mg/l, and (c) 2.1 mg/l.

methylmalonyl-coa decarboxylase (16), thereby permitting
all of the carbon atoms of a polyketide to be derived from
glucose. second, if a starter acyl-coa is supplied, the source
of the starter and extender units will be decoupled, allowing
unusual starter units to be incorporated into the polyketide.
we anticipated three potential problems in introducing an
effective  xxxg1485xxx -epimerase pathway
into e. coli: (1) expressing holo- xxxg1485xxx ,
since e. coli does not contain coenzyme b12; (2) effectively
converting intracellular (2r)-methylmalonyl-coa to the (2s)isomer needed for polyketide synthesis; and (3) accumulation

5200 biochemistry, vol. 41, no. 16, 2002
of intracellular foreign acyl-coas in sufficient amounts
without untoward toxicity. in this study, each of these issues
was addressed.
our first objective was to express holo-methylmalonylcoa mutase in e. coli and to demonstrate accumulation of
methylmalonyl-coa. although e. coli possesses a gene (sbm)
that encodes a putative  xxxg1485xxx , neither
mutase activity nor methylmalonyl-coa is detectable in cell
extracts. the p. shermanii and e. coli methylmalonyl-coa
mutases have previously been expressed in e. coli as inactive
apo-enzymes that require reconstitution with coenzyme b12
to form the active holo-enzyme (7, 16). we confirmed these
results and also showed that, as with the p. shermanii enzyme
(23), the coenzyme b12-reconstituted his10-sbm produced
(2r)- rather than (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa. although e. coli
does not produce coenzyme b12, it possesses btur, which
encodes an enzyme that introduces the adenosyl moiety into
mature coenzyme b12 precursors, such as  xxxd2300xxx 
(24). indeed, active b12-dependent  xxxg1479xxx  was
expressed in e. coli by inclusion of  xxxd2300xxx  in a
minimal growth medium (14). when e. coli cells expressing
p. shermanii mutase were grown in minimal medium
containing  xxxd2300xxx , the mutase recovered from cell
extracts was catalytically active. furthermore, when e. coli
harboring the p. shermanii or e. coli mutase genes (native
or his10) was grown in medium containing  xxxd2300xxx , intracellular methylmalonyl-coa comprised ∼10% of
the acyl-coa pool (figure 3), corresponding to ∼40 µm (3).
this exceeds the km of (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa (∼25 µm)
for debs or debs1+te (25, 26) and should thus support
polyketide synthesis.
our next objective was to convert intracellular (2r)methylmalonyl-coa to the (2s)-isomer. to produce (2s)methylmalonyl-coa in vivo, coexpression of a functional
epimerase is required to interconvert the (r)- and (s)-isomers
of methylmalonyl-coa (figure 2). although the cloning and
sequencing of methylmalonyl-coa epimerase from p. shermanii (8) have previously been reported (27), the gene
sequence was neither available in the public domain nor
available to us. thus, we isolated the p. shermanii epimerase
gene by screening a cosmid library of genomic dna, using
dna probes derived from the sequence of the p. shermanii
epimerase protein that we purified and sequenced. the p.
shermanii epimerase sequence was also used to identify a
methylmalonyl-coa epimerase gene from the s. coelicolor
genomic database. the p. shermanii and s. coelicolor
epimerases were expressed in e. coli both individually and
with the methylmalonyl-coa mutases. the two epimerases
examined were shown to have similar steady-state kinetic
parameters.
our final objective was to coexpress mutase, epimerase,
and debs, and demonstrate polyketide biosynthesis. ultimate proof of having engineered a functional mutaseepimerase pathway in e. coli hinged on production of a
complex polyketide that required (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa,
the final product of the engineered pathway. we coexpressed
the p. shermanii mutase and epimerase in e. coli k173-145
along with debs, a pks that produces 6-deb from
propionyl- and (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa, and demonstrated
that 6-deb was produced at ∼1 mg/l. to ascertain the origin
of the carbon atoms in the 6-deb product, we fed cultures
[13c3]-labeled propionate and determined the isotopic content

dayem et al.
of resulting 6-deb by mass spectroscopy. all ions of 6-deb
were shifted exactly 3 mass units higher when [13c3]propionate was used as the exogenous precursor (figure
5a,b). furthermore, no unlabeled product was detected,
indicating that the exogenous [13c3]propionate was not
diluted by endogenously derived propionate, as might arise
from decarboxylation of the unlabeled methylmalonyl-coa
extender unit. thus, exogenous propionate serves exclusively
as the starter unit. as a control, we used the pcc system to
produce (2s)-methylmalonyl-coa from [13c3]propionyl-coa,
which generated a uniformly labeled 6-deb product, indicating that both the starter and extender units stemmed from
the fed propionate (figure 5c).
perspectives. the “chemobiosynthetic” method for incorporating unusual starter units into polyketides involves
inactivating the first module of a pks and feeding host cells
a chemically synthesized diketide thiol ester; the diketide
enters the biosynthetic pathway at the second module and is
incorporated into the polyketide product (28). the present
work presents an alternative method for producing polyketides
with novel starter units, independent of diketide feeding. the
approach exploits the mutase-epimerase pathway by enabling extender units to be generated independently of starter
units. that is, the extender units are derived from endogenously produced intermediatessmalonyl- and methylmalonyl-coaswhereas the starter unit is derived from an
exogenous sourcesin the present case, propionatesthat is
activated to an acyl-coa foreign to the cell. by introducing
a pathway to produce a foreign acyl-coa from an exogenously supplied carboxylic precursor, it is possible to
generate and accumulate novel acyl-coas in e. coli.
provided such foreign acyl-coas are accepted as substrates
by the starting module of a pks, they would be incorporated
into the polyketide, affording an alternative to diketide
feeding. the results of such studies will be the subject of a
forthcoming report.
