j.h. skerritt and g.a.r. johnston, enhancement of gaba binding by benzodiazepines and related anxiolytics,
european j. pharmacol. 89 (1983) 193-198.
several benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam and oxazepam) produced a concentration-dependent enhancement of low affinity gaba binding to fresh, washed brain membranes in 50
mm tris-citrate buffer at concentrations comparable to those displacing [3h]diazepam binding in vitro. the
nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics cl218872 and zopiclone also enhanced gaba binding, while the centrally inactive
benzodiazepine ro5-4864 failed to alter gaba binding. the benzodiazepine antagonist, ro15-1788 did not alter
gaba binding but potently antagonised stimulation of gaba binding by 100 nm diazepam. these pharmacological
characteristics suggest that an enhancement of the binding of gaba to low affinity receptor sites may give rise to
many of the in vivo actions of the benzodiazepines.

1. introduction

the suggested presence of benzodiazepine receptors in brain tissue arose from the results of
several behavioural and electrophysiological studies (haefely et al., 1981). specific binding sites for
radiolabelled benzodiazepines were identified in
membrane preparations from the brains of animals
and humans (braestrup and squires, 1977;
braestrup et al., 1977), and in general the clinical
potencies of a range of benzodiazepines correlated
with their affinities for these sites (braestrup et al.,
1982).
while initial studies with unwashed brain homogenates failed to demonstrate modulation of
benzodiazepine binding by any putative neurotransmitter, membranes subjected to more extensive washing a n d / o r freezing revealed that the
inhibitory neurotransmitter, gaba could enhance
in vitro benzodiazepine binding (tallman et al.,

anxiolytics

anticonvulsants

1978). this phenomenon has been considered by
many to be biochemical support for extensive
electrophysiological evidence for a specific enhancement of gaba mediated inhibition by the
benzodiazepines (polc and haefely, 1976; choi et
al., 1977).
attempts to demonstrate a corresponding enhancement of gaba binding by benzodiazepines
have generally been less successful. although there
are some reports of such enhancement (costa et
al., 1978; johnston and willow, 1981; matsumoto
and fukuda, 1982; meiners and salama, 1982),
several groups have been unable to demonstrate
benzodiazepine enhancement of gaba binding.
we have recently found experimental conditions
to provide a concentration-dependent enhancement of in vitro gaba binding by diazepam, in
fresh, washed membranes of whole rat brain. such
enhancement is extremely sensitive to changes in
synaptosomal membrane integrity (skerritt et al.,
1982a), and involves an increase in the affinity of
the lower affinity gaba binding site (skerritt et
al., 1982d).

194

in order to assess the relevance of enhancement
of gaba binding to the identified pharmacological actions of the benzodiazepines, we examined
the in vitro effects of several pharmacologically
active benzodiazepines upon low affinity gaba
binding to rat brain membranes. the nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics cl218,872 (a triazolopyridazine, lippa et al., 1979) and zopiclone (blanchard
et al., 1979) were also investigated in the same
manner. we report that while low concentrations
of several benzodiazepines as well as cl218872
and zopiclone enhanced gaba binding, the
anomalous benzodiazepine, ro5-4864, and the
benzodiazepine antagonist, ro15-1788, failed to
alter low affinity gaba binding. ro 15-1788, however, potently reversed the enhancement of gaba
binding by diazepam.

2. materials and methods

washed synaptosomal membranes from whole
brains of male 12 week old sprague-dawley rats
were prepared as described earlier (skerritt et al.,
1982d). briefly, brain tissue was homogenized with
a loose-fitting homogenizer (0.22 mm clearance) in
0.32 m sucrose, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10
rain and the supernatant from this centrifugation
recentrifuged at 14500 × g for 20 min. the synaptosomal-mitochondrial pellet formed at this
stage was lysed in distilled water, and washed
eight times in assay buffer (0.05 m tris-citrate, ph
7.1 at 2°c). although freezing and more extensive
membrane disruption produce greater gaba
binding when subsequently assayed (skerritt and
johnston, 1982), these procedures decrease or
abolish its enhancement by diazepam (skerritt et
al., 1982a). accordingly, all experiments were conducted on fresh membrane material.
gaba binding assays were performed in a
total volume of 1 ml. membranes (0.4 0.6 mg
protein) were incubated for 15 min at 2°c with
250 nm [3h]gaba (specific activity 2 ci/mmol)
in the presence or absence of various benzodiazepines and related compounds. nonsaturable
gaba binding was assessed using 1 mm gaba.
pellets were harvested by centrifugation and
washed as earlier described (skerritt and johnston,

1982). midazolam was used as the maleatc salt,
while other compounds were suspended in dimethylsulfoxide vehicle (maximum final concentration,
0.01%), which alone failed to alter gaba binding.
[3h]gaba (97 ci/mmol, before isotope dilution)
was obtained from new england nuclear and
unlabelled gaba from calbiochem. diazepam,
nitrazepam and chlordiazepoxide were gifts of
roche australia, while oxazepam was provided by
wyeth pharmaceuticals. clonazepam, midazolam,
cl218872 (3-methyl-6-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)1,2,4-triazolo(4,3-b)pyridazine), ro5-4864 (7chloro- 1,3-dihydro- 1-met  xxxg1380xxx -5-(p-chlorophenyl)2h-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) and zopiclone (6-(5chloro-2-pyridyl)-6,7-dihydro-7-oxo-5h-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-5-yl-4-methyl- 1-piperazinecarboxylate) were obtained from roche products, nutley,
new jersey, u.s.a. ro 15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4h-imidazo[ 1,5a],[ 1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) was a gift of dr. w.
haefely, roche, basle, switzerland.

3. results

at 250 nm ligand concentration, saturable
gaba binding to washed synaptosomal membranes was 25-33% of total binding. previous
scatchard analyses indicated that binding under
those conditions is almost exclusively to the lower
affinity gaba binding site, which has an equilibrium dissociation constant of 822 nm (skerritt
et al., 1982d). each of the six clinically used benzodiazepines tested enhanced gaba binding at
concentrations of 1/~m or lower (fig. 1). diazepam, oxazepam and nitrazepam produced significant enhancement  xxxd1891xxx  nm, while midazolam,
clonazepam, and chlordiazepoxide enhanced
gaba binding at 100 nm and greater. increasing
the benzodiazepine concentration above 1/~m
failed to cause further enhancement (skerritt et al.,
1982b). maximal enhancement of gaba binding
ranged between 22% over control (100 nm midazolam) and 37% (1 /~m diazepam) (fig. 1).
the nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics cl218872
and zopiclone both enhanced gaba binding
(fig. 2). while cl218872 was almost as potent as
diazepam, zopiclone had a clearly biphasic effect

ro5-8464 (10 n m - 1 /im) and ro15-1788 (0.1
nm i ~ m ) both failed to alter gaba binding
(fig. 2, table 1). the latter compound, however,
potently antagonized enhancement of gaba
binding by 100 nm diazepam, with 1 nm ro151788 producing approximately 50% inhibition of
diazepam-enhanced gaba binding (table 1).

4. discussion
the finding that a range of benzodiazepines
enhance gaba binding is in keeping with other
clinical and experimental studies. flunitrazepam
and chlordiazepoxide produce diazepam-like
potentiation of gaba-mediated inhibition in the
cat spinal cord and in neuronal cultures (polc and
haefely, 1976; choi et al., 1977), while oxazepam,
chlordiazepoxide and several other benzodiazepines produce diazepam-like anticonflict behaviour in experimental models of anxiety (sepinwall and cook, 1980). indeed, meiners and salama
(1982) have demonstrated enhancement of gaba
binding by both diazepam and chlordiazepoxide.
the relative potencies of the various benzodi-

azepines as enhancers of [-~h]gaba binding do
not correspond exactly with their potencies as
inhibitors of either [)h]diazepam binding, or binding of the antagonist [3h]ro 15-1788 to washed
synaptosomal membranes (braestrup and squires,
1977: skerritt et al., 1982b). thus, clonazepam, the
most potent of the clinically used benzodiazepines
in inhibiting the in vitro binding of [)h]diazepam,
was of only moderate potency as an enhancer of
[3h]gaba binding, consistent with the findings
of matsumoto and fukuda (1982) that clonazepain was a slightly weaker enhancer of low affinity
[3h]muscimol binding than was diazepam.
the results on enhancement of [-~h]gaba
binding are more consistent with the ability of
gaba to increase the binding of the various
benzodiazepine agonists to benzodiazepine receptors than with their potencies in displacing [-~h]diazepam in the absence of gaba despite different
assay conditions (braestrup et al., 1982: fujimoto
et al., 1982; skerritt et al., 1982b). in the same
washed synaptosomal membrane preparations
from rat brain as used in the present study, we
have examined the influence of 100/*m gaba on
the potencies of various benzodiazepines, used in
the present study, as inhibitors of [3h]ro15-1788
binding (skerritt et al., 1982b). some benzodiazepines such as diazepam and oxazepam show
consistently greater potency shifts induced by
gaba than do clonazepam or midazolam, although the affinities of the latter agents for benzodiazepine receptors are severalfold greater.
the apparent lack of correlation between the
degree of enhancement of gaba binding by a
given benzodiazepine and its affinity for benzodiazepine receptors as assessed by binding studies
may be explained by the likelihood that not all
benzodiazepine receptors are coupled to gaba
receptors. discrete subclasses of benzodiazepine
binding proteins have been separated by physicochemical means (sieghart and karobath, 1980;
lo et al., 1982) and gaba fails to alter the
affinity of certain purines for benzodiazepine
binding sites (skerritt et al., 1982b).
although ro5-4864 lacks diazepam-like central
actions, specific binding sites for this benzodiazepine have been characterized in brain (schoemaker et al., 1981). however, ro5-4864 sites do

197

not appear to be coupled to gaba receptors.
gaba binding is not altered by a wide range of
ro5-4864 concentrations and binding of [3h]ro54864 to brain is unaffected by gaba. in addition,
the potency of diazepam as an inhibitor of
[3h]ro5-4864 binding is unaltered by 100 /~m
gaba (chen chow and skerritt, unpublished).
zopiclone
and
the
triazolopyridazine,
cl218872, the first nonbenzodiazepine compounds demonstrated to displace [3h]diazepam
binding at submicromolar concentrations, have
benzodiazepine-like anticonflict and anticonvulsant actions in animals (blanchard et al., 1979;
lippa et al., 1979; braestrup et al., 1982). gaba
binding was enhanced by 10-1000 nm cl218872,
concentrations comparable with those displacing
[3h]diazepam binding. the affinity of this agent
for benzodiazepine receptors has been shown both
indirectly (regan et al., 1981; skerritt et al., 1982a)
and by direct [3h]cl218872 binding studies
(yamamura et al., 1982) to be increased by gaba.
it appears therefore, that the subpopulation or
conformation of benzodiazepine receptors to which
cl218872 has been suggested to bind is coupled
to the low affinity gaba binding site. zopiclone
only slightly enhanced gaba binding. other studies have shown weak (braestrup et al., 1982) or
negligible (skerritt et al., 1982a) enhancement by
gaba of zopiclone displacement potency for benzodiazepine binding. thus, the site to which
zopiclone binds may be intermediate in its mode
of coupling to the gaba binding site, to those
conformations of a benzodiazepine-gaba receptor complex formed following diazepam binding,
or on the other hand, ethyl-/~-carboline-3carboxylate binding to this complex. the binding
affinity of the potent benzodiazepine receptor
ligand ethyl-/~-carboline-3-carboxylate is unaltered
by gaba (braestrup and nielsen, 1981), and
conversely, gaba binding is not enhanced by this
/~-carboline ester (skerritt et al., 1982c).
the imidazobenzodiazepine ro 15-1788, while
lacking convulsive or anxiogenic activity, has been
demonstrated to potently antagonize many of the
behavioural and electrophysiological actions of the
benzodiazepines (hunkeler et al., 1981; mohler et
al., 1981; polc et al., 1981). gaba fails to alter

the binding of [3h]roi5-1788, as do several other
agents (e.g. barbiturates) known to induce conformation changes in binding sites for 'agonist' benzodiazepines. the observation that ro 15-1788 (0.1
nm-1 /~m) failed to alter gaba binding would
suggest that the antagonist also fails to induce
conformational changes in gaba receptors. although high doses of ro15-1788 have been reported to have diazepam-like anticonvulsant activity in animals (nutt et al., 1982), no alteration of
gaba binding was seen even with quite high in
vitro concentrations.
the potent antagonism of diazepam-stimulated
gaba binding by ro15-1788, corresponding to
the known benzodiazepine antagonist action of
this compound, adds further support to the notion
that benzodiazepine enhancement of low affinity
gaba binding, observed in vitro, is closely related
to the in vivo actions of the benzodiazepines.
ro15-1788 is a more potent antagonist of diazepam stimulated gaba binding than the fl-carboline esters, methyl-fl-carboline-3-carboxylate
and ethyl-fl-carboline-3-carboxylate (skerritt et al.,
1982c), which are also considered to act as benzodiazepine antagonists.
there appears to be a direct relationship in
vitro between the ability of a given benzodiazepine
receptor ligand to enhance gaba binding, and
the efficacy of gaba in increasing the affinity of
this ligand for the benzodiazepine receptor. other
factors, however, such as the ionic environment,
temperature of incubation, and the presence of
endogenous modulators of gaba binding (skerritt et al., 1982d; skerritt and johnston, 1982) may
differentially affect these two aspects of the coupling of benzodiazepine and gaba receptors.
