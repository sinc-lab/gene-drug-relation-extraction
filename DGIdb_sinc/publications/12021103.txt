abstract: molecular mimicry between the 65-kda isoform of  xxxd2431xxx 
decarboxylase ( xxxg850xxx ) and the protein 2c (p2c) of coxsackie b4 virus (cbv)
may initiate human type 1 diabetes.  xxxg850xxx  contains a motif that has a 6-amino
acid identity with cbv-p2c (pevkek), whereas the weakly autoantigenic isoform,  xxxg849xxx , contains pevktk. a human-derived monoclonal antibody
(mab) mica3 reacts with a surface loop of  xxxg850xxx  that includes pevkek,
and mutagenic deletion of this loop was shown to reduce reactivity of gad with
the mab by 70%. to establish that the pevkek motif on  xxxg850xxx  contains a
major epitope for diabetes sera and to identify the amino acids involved, mutants of nucleotides of  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  at sites in the pevkek motif were
created and the expressed proteins used for radioimmunoprecipitation (rip)
tests with sera from patients with type 1 diabetes. a potent mouse mab (gad6)
to  xxxg850xxx , and a rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab108) to  xxxg849xxx , were used to
standardize the reactivity of the diabetes sera with the mutant molecules. of 45
type 1 diabetes sera tested, 30 (67%) had an 80% or greater reduction of reactivity to  xxxg850xxx ∆258–270 vs. intact  xxxg850xxx . various single-surface amino acids
in the pevkek epitope region of  xxxg850xxx  were mutated, but most molecules
carrying these mutations reacted similarly to the parent molecule. however after point mutation of the equivalent motif of  xxxg849xxx  (pevktk to pevkek),
there was an increase in the reactivity of 12 of 49 (24%) type 1 diabetes sera
tested; 7 of 8 sera reactive with  xxxg849xxx  showed increased reactivity with
gad67t273e, and 5 previously negative sera gained reactivity with
gad67t273e. thus, the pevkek motif on  xxxg850xxx  contributes to serologic reactivity of type 1 diabetes sera. this favors the hypothesis that cbv infection
causes type 1 diabetes by the process of viral mimicry with cross-reactivity to
a critical epitope of  xxxg850xxx .

introduction
molecular mimicry between  xxxg850xxx  and p2c of coxsackie b4 virus has been
proposed as a cause of type 1 diabetes.1–3  xxxg850xxx  contains a region of homology
that includes a 6–amino acid identical sequence pevkek (residues 260 to 265),
identical with the cbv-p2c protein. in contrast, in the weakly autoantigenic  xxxg849xxx 
isoform, the corresponding 6–amino acid sequence is pevktk. one of the widely
studied human-derived monoclonal antibodies (mab) to  xxxg850xxx , mica3, is known
to react with a surface loop of  xxxg850xxx  that includes pevkek and, after mutagenic
deletion of this “pevkek loop,” the reactivity of mica3 with  xxxg850xxx  was reduced
by 70%.4 the aim of the present study was to use site-directed mutagenesis of nucleotides that encoded amino acids in the pevkek region to identify possible critical single residues for binding of gad-reactive mabs and type 1 diabetes sera to
the pevkek epitope.

materials and methods
antibodies
sera from 67 patients with type 1 diabetes and 16 healthy blood donors were studied.  xxxd2207xxx  class mab to  xxxg850xxx , designated mica3 and mica4, were donated by dr. joseph endl (roche, mannheim, germany); they were derived from ebvtransformed b lymphocyte cell lines from peripheral blood of a newly diagnosed patient with type 1 diabetes.5 both mabs have a high avidity for  xxxg850xxx  relative to
other  xxxg850xxx -binding micas.6,7 the mouse mabs  xxxg849xxx  and gad6 to gad658,9
were derived from hybridomas obtained from the developmental studies hybridoma bank, university of iowa, and were prepared in our laboratory as described previously.10 the rabbit polyclonal antibody ab108 to  xxxg849xxx  was purchased from
chemicon international, inc. (temecula, ca).
derivation of mutant molecules of  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx 
mutant molecules of  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  were prepared using a quikchange
site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca) and appropriate oligonucleotides. these mutants, shown in figure 1, were confirmed by sequencing prior to
testing by radioimmunoprecipitation (rip) assays. the template cdna was generated as a construct encoding residues 1–101 of  xxxg849xxx  fused to residues 96–585 of
 xxxg850xxx . the encoded recombinant hybrid  xxxg849xxx /65 molecule has favorable properties for purification purposes, but, for the purposes of this study, the hybrid
 xxxg849xxx /65 molecule was taken to be equivalent to  xxxg850xxx  since it reacted similarly
to  xxxg850xxx  in radioimmunoprecipitation (rip) assays with sera of patients with type
1 diabetes.11 selection of the mutants to be generated was based on a structural comparison of amino acids in the region of 255 to 273 of the  xxxg850xxx  sequence that represent the pevkek region of the pyridoxal-phosphate (plp)-binding domain of
 xxxg850xxx , and a similar region of  xxxg849xxx  was predicted using computer generated 3dimensional models of the plp-binding domain of  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx .12 as
judged from these models, the amino acids selected for mutagenesis would be both

surface-exposed and, within a diameter of 20 angstroms encompassing the pevkek
motif, representative of the size of an antibody epitope. three mutants were designed
in which either one or two amino acids in the  xxxg850xxx  sequence were changed to
equivalent residues in the sequence in  xxxg849xxx , or vice-versa. these mutants were
 xxxg849xxx /65f256y,m258y,  xxxg849xxx /65r272k , and gad67t273e.
a fourth mutant,  xxxg849xxx /65k263a,k265a, was also prepared because peptides selected by antibody (mica3) probing of phage-displayed peptide libraries could be
aligned to the pevkek region and were rich in basic amino acid residues, leading
to the proposal that lys263 and lys265 were directly involved in the binding of
mica3 to  xxxg850xxx .4
radioimmunoprecipitation
reactivity of  xxxg849xxx /65,  xxxg849xxx , or the mutants with sera or mabs was measured by rip, using 35s-labeled rabbit reticulocyte lysate (rrl)-expressed antigen
as described previously.13  xxxg849xxx /65 has been shown to react similarly to  xxxg850xxx 
in rip assays with diabetes sera.14 in brief: 40, 000 dpm of 35s-gad, was held overnight with 5 µl of test serum at 4°c, after which immune complexes were precipitated with protein a-sepharose and then harvested by centrifugation and washed; the
precipitated antigen was determined by scintillation counting. all rrl-expressed
proteins were diluted in pbs containing 5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) to stabilize the conformation of the mutant proteins. mabs mica3, mica4,  xxxg849xxx ,
gad6, and the polyclonal antibody ab108 were tested in each assay run. the reactivity of each mutant molecule was compared with that of the parent molecule
( xxxg849xxx /65 or  xxxg849xxx ) tested in the same assay run. for  xxxg849xxx /65 or its mutants,
the total amount of antigen used in the rip was assessed using the mouse mab
gad6, which binds a linear epitope of  xxxg850xxx  located in the c terminal domain.15

 xxxg849xxx /65 for each serum. panels a–d show that there is substantial reduction in reactivity
with the pevkek deletion (a), no reduction with mutations of one or two residues that differ between  xxxg849xxx  and  xxxg850xxx  (b,c), and minor reduction with the lysine mutations (d).

 xxxg849xxx , became positive with gad67t273e.

the amount of correctly folded antigen in the each preparation was measured using
the mouse mab  xxxg849xxx , since  xxxg849xxx  recognizes a highly conformational epitope that
is destroyed by almost all truncations and mutations of the  xxxg850xxx  molecule.15,16
for  xxxg849xxx  and the mutant gad67t273e, the amount of protein antigen was assessed using the polyclonal antibody ab108. results were transformed to units of
reactivity by defining the reactivity of antigen with gad6 (for  xxxg850xxx  mutants), or
with ab108 (for  xxxg849xxx  mutants), as 100%. a given diabetes serum was designated
as positive if the reactivity was greater than the mean plus three standard deviations
of the reactivity for 16 normal human sera.

results
binding of antibodies to  xxxg849xxx /65 and to  xxxg849xxx 
the sera from 45 patients with type 1 diabetes were tested for reactivity with
 xxxg849xxx /65, while sera from 49 type 1 diabetes patients were tested for reactivity
with  xxxg849xxx . thirty-eight of the 45 (84%) sera tested contained antibodies to
 xxxg849xxx /65, while 8 of the 49 (14%) sera tested reacted with  xxxg849xxx . the mabs
mica3, mica4,  xxxg849xxx , gad6 and the polyclonal antibody ab108 all reacted with
 xxxg849xxx /65, while only ab108 reacted with  xxxg849xxx .
binding of antibodies to  xxxg849xxx /65∆258–270
we determined whether the pevkek motif, comprising amino acids 260–265,
participated in an immunodominant disease-associated epitope by testing the mutant
 xxxg849xxx /65∆258–270 that lacked these residues, using sera from 45 patients with type
1 diabetes together with the highly conformation-dependent mab,  xxxg849xxx . since the
degree of reactivity of  xxxg849xxx  with this mutant was 54% of that with intact  xxxg849xxx /
65, this figure was taken as representing the proportion of correctly folded mutant
molecules of gad among the  xxxg849xxx /65∆258–270 preparation. of the 45 sera tested,
33 (73%) had a reduction in reactivity with  xxxg849xxx /65∆258-270 that exceeded 54%
versus the intact molecule and, for 30 of these 33 (67% of all of the sera), there was
a reduction in reactivity of 80% or greater, indicating that residues 258–270 contributed to the formation of a  xxxg850xxx  epitope. all 12 sera that retained 54% or more
reactivity had high levels of anti-gad (fig . 2a). binding of mica3 and mica4 was
reduced by 84% and 67%, respectively.
binding of antibodies to  xxxg849xxx /65 molecules containing
point mutations in the pevkek region
the contribution of particular amino acids close to the pevkek loop was examined using two “swap” mutants of  xxxg849xxx /65,  xxxg849xxx /65 f256y,m258y and  xxxg849xxx /
65r272k. in each case, the reactivity of the mutant and parent molecules was similar
on testing with type 1 diabetes sera, mica3, mica4, or  xxxg849xxx  (fig . 2b and c). the
contribution of basic amino acids in the pevkek region to antibody binding was
examined using 45 type-1 diabetes sera and the mutant  xxxg849xxx /65k263a,k265a in
which lysine263 and lysine265, which occur in both  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx , were replaced by alanine. the mean (± standard deviation) reduction in reactivity with the

187

mutant was 13 ± 0.11% of that of  xxxg849xxx /65. for 15 sera there was a loss of 20–
40% reactivity; for 26 sera, the loss was 0-20%; and for 4 sera there was a slight gain
(<5%) in reactivity (fig . 2d). binding of mica3, mica4 and  xxxg849xxx  was reduced
by 5%, 10%, and 0%, respectively.
effect of single amino acid replacement of
 xxxg849xxx  to  xxxg850xxx  (gad67t273e)
point mutation of the pevktk motif of  xxxg849xxx  to pevkek resulted in an increase of reactivity in 12 of 49 (24%) sera (fig . 2e). seven of the 8 sera reactive with
 xxxg849xxx  showed increased reactivity with gad67t273e, mean 37 units (range 16 to
63 units) vs. 46 units (24 to 71 units); one remained unchanged at 82 units. a further
5 sera became positive (>15 units) with  xxxg849xxx , mean −3 units (range −6 to 2 units)
vs. 32 units (18 to 45 units) with gad67t273e.

discussion
autoimmune diseases are characterized by tissue destruction and/or impairment
of function as a result of effects of autoreactive lymphoid cells and/or autoantibodies. environmental microbial agents have long been implicated in the development
of autoimmune diseases. one explanation for this is molecular mimicry, where there
is a cross-reactive immune response due to structural homologies between molecules
expressed by the human host and the invading microorganism.17 this can occur either by a linear amino acid sequence, or by a conformational epitope shared by these
different protein molecules. molecular mimicry was first described in 1964 by
damian, who proposed that microbes used sharing of antigen with host protein as a
means of protection from attack by the host.18
type 1 diabetes is a t cell–dependent autoimmune disease that results from specific autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, although likely multiple immunological pathways remain to be fully defined. specifically, in type 1 diabetes,
epitope mimicry between p2c of coxsackie b4 virus and an homologous sequence
of the autoantigen  xxxg850xxx  is strongly suspected. the evidence is that the amino acid
sequences of p2c exhibit striking homology with a sequence in  xxxg850xxx , pevkek,
and this sequence is highly conserved among coxsackie virus b4 isolates and other
viruses of the subgroup of coxsackie b-like viruses.2,19 the requirement of the
pevkek motif for antigenicity of  xxxg850xxx  was well corroborated in the present
study. however, since the coxsackie b viruses are the most prevalent enteroviruses,
and hence exposure to the pevkek mimicry motif should be a frequent event
throughout life, other factors must contribute as well, notably genetic risk conferred
by hla alleles and other elements. clearly, if mimicry were to contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes, then the study of reactivity of mutant gad molecules
lacking this motif should provide an important insight into this hypothesis. we do
not intend here to engage the issue of the relative pathogenetic contribution of t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes, which obviously bears strongly on the mimicry hypothesis. all that needs stating is that while t cells are likely effectors of islet
damage and may well initiate islet cell destruction, gad-specific b cells are impor-

tant contributors to perpetuation, if only by their capacity to act as antigen capturing
and antigen presenting cells.20,21
our data reveal the limitations in the application of single point mutations for the
analysis of antibody epitopes. conformational epitopes are formed from amino acid
residues brought into contact during protein folding. detailed across-species studies
using  xxxg569xxx  have indicated that, while two to three particular amino acids
may serve as critical contact residues, surrounding amino acids can contribute substantial binding energy.22,23 for example, in the study of schwartz et al.,24 mutation
of a single residue (aa 264)  xxxd2431xxx  to threonine in pevkek of  xxxg850xxx 
proved insufficient to reduce substantially ab binding. likewise, conservative substitution by point mutation of amino acids 256, 258, and 272 of  xxxg850xxx  in the region
of the epitope that differs between  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  did not alter antibody binding in the present study. by contrast, “back mutation” in  xxxg849xxx  conferred reactivity
for some sera.
a previous study in our laboratory4 using phage display suggested that basic
amino acids may be important for antibody binding and, as shown by the present
study, mutation of the two lysines conserved between  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  did, in
fact, reduce reactivity by ~15%, further suggesting that they indeed contribute to ab
binding.
as a final point, the creation of a mutant, gad67t273e, that results in acquisition
of autoimmune reactivity is a novel approach to the study of epitopes. in the case of
diabetes serology, the existence of two isoforms of an enzyme autoantigen with a
high degree of sequence and functional homology, but markedly different reactivities to autoantibodies, provides a unique opportunity to exploit this approach in the
study of b cell epitopes.
