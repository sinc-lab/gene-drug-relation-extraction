7.0 ⫻ 10⫺3/min (t1/2 ⫽ 98 min) for [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx , respectively. these association rates increased (4- to
11-fold) when the charged arginine residue located at the entrance to the main hydrophobic channel was mutated to smaller
uncharged amino acids (arg120ala, arg120gln, and
arg120asn). mutation of residues located within the active site
of cox-2 that define a ‘side pocket’ (tyr355ala, val523ile, ihi)
of the main channel had a greater effect on the dissociation rate
than the association rate. these mutations, which modified the
shape of and access to the ‘side pocket’, affected the binding
affinity of [3h] xxxd3481xxx  more than that of [3h]celecoxib. these
binding studies provide direct insight into the properties and
binding constants of celecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx  to cox-2.

prostaglandins are synthesized from  xxxd208xxx  by
the enzyme prostaglandin h synthase (also referred to as
cyclooxygenase, cox). there are, at present, two identified
forms of this enzyme, cox-1 and cox-2, each distinctly
regulated. cox-1 is expressed in many tissues, including the
gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and platelets, whereas cox-2
is expressed at sites of inflammation, the hippocampus, female reproductive tissue, and many cancers (sirois and richards, 1993; yamagata et al., 1993; masferrer et al., 1994;
seibert et al., 1994; turini and dubois, 2002). evidence
indicates that cox-2– derived prostaglandins are involved in
the signs and symptoms of arthritis and some forms of pain.
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) inhibit both
cox-1 and cox-2 (mitchell et al., 1994; seibert et al., 1994;
gierse et al., 1995), and cause gastrointestinal injury, presumably caused by inhibition of cox-1. selective inhibitors
of cox-2 (the coxibs: celecoxib, rofecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx ) were
developed to avoid the side effects of nsaids caused by
cox-1 inhibition (hawkey, 1999).
nonspecific nsaids inhibit cox-1 and cox-2 with varying potencies and apparent selectivity (patrignani et al.,
1997; warner et al., 1999). some nsaids have been reported
to preferentially inhibit cox-1 (e.g., indomethacin) and oth-

ers, cox-2 (e.g.,  xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx ); generally, however,
the selectivity for cox-1 versus cox-2 as measured by inhibition of enzyme activity varies widely depending on the
assay system used (meade et al., 1993; barnett et al., 1994;
mitchell et al., 1994; gierse et al., 1999); thus, a means for
directly assessing binding of nsaids and coxibs to cox
isoforms would be useful, particularly to determine true kinetic rate constants. the binding site of nsaids on cox-1,
cox-2, and cox-2 variants has been visualized crystallographically (picot et al., 1994; kurumbail et al., 1996); the
primary active site residue differences between cox-1 and
cox-2 are located at ile523, ser516, his513, and ile434,
using the cox-1 numbering system (kurumbail et al., 1996).
arg120, located near the entrance to the main channel, appears in cox-1 to be located within ionic bond distance of the
substrate  xxxd208xxx  and to be important for catalytic
efficiency (bhattacharyya et al., 1996). in cox-2, arg120 has
considerably less kinetic influence (rieke et al., 1999). in
general, arg120 forms an ion pair with the carboxylate moiety of nsaids, and mutation of arg120 significantly decreases the inhibitory potency of these nsaids but increases
the potency of nonacid inhibitors of cox-1 (mancini et al.,
1995). tyr355 and ile523 form part of the entrance to a side

abstract
two compounds (celecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx ) from the diarylheterocycle class of cyclooxygenase inhibitors were radiolabeled
and used to characterize their binding to  xxxg1883xxx 
(cox-1),  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2), several single-point variants of cox-2 (val523ile, tyr355ala, arg120ala, arg120gln,
arg120asn) and one triple-point variant of cox-2 [val523ile,
arg513his, val434ile (ihi)]. we demonstrate highly specific and
saturable binding of these inhibitors to cox-2. under the same
assay conditions, little or no specific binding to cox-1 could be
detected. the affinity of [3h]celecoxib for cox-2 (kd ⫽ 2.3 nm)
was similar to the affinity of [3h] xxxd3481xxx  (kd ⫽ 3.2 nm). the
binding to cox-2 seems to be both rapid and slowly reversible
with association rates of 5.8 ⫻ 106/m/min and 4.5 ⫻ 106/m/min
and dissociation rates of 14 ⫻ 10⫺3/min (t1/2 ⫽ 50 min) and

diarylheterocyclic inhibitor binding to cyclooxygenase

materials and methods
materials. hemin, indomethacin, naproxen,  xxxd2556xxx , ibuprofen, and  xxxd2969xxx  were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st.
louis, mo).  xxxd2727xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx  were prepared in-house by
the searle medicinal chemistry department.  xxxd208xxx  was
obtained from nu-chek prep, inc (elysian, mn), and the other fatty
acid substrates, ␥- xxxd2490xxx , docosatetranoic acid, eicosapentanoic acid, and docosapentanoic acid were obtained from cayman
chemical (ann arbor, mi). for the preparation of radiolabeled inhibitors,4-[5-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl-4-bromo)-1h-pyrazol1-yl]-benzenesulfonamide and 4-[3-(4-bromophenyl)-5-methyl-isoxazol4-yl]-benzenesulfonamide (fig. 1) were treated with tritium gas in the
presence of a palladium catalyst to obtain celecoxib tritiated at the
4-position of the  xxxd3045xxx  ring ([3h]celecoxib; specific radioactivity, 3
ci/mmol) and  xxxd3481xxx  labeled at the 4-position of the 3-position
benzene ring ([3h] xxxd3481xxx ; specific radioactivity, 10 ci/mmol), respectively.

enzyme preparation. cox-1 purified from sheep seminal vesicles and recombinant murine cox-2 expressed in insect cells was
obtained as described previously (gierse et al., 1999). briefly for
cox-1, sheep seminal vesicles were homogenized into 50 mm trishcl, ph 8.0, 1 mm  xxxd1917xxx  (dedtc), 1 mm edta,
and 0.01% sodium azide and then centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000g to remove
cell debris. the supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000g to collect
the microsomal fraction, which was washed once with homogenization buffer containing 115 mm sodium perchlorate and then extracted with 1.5% decyl-maltoside (c10m). the extract was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was concentrated by
ultrafiltration using a 30-kda molecular mass cutoff membrane and
applied to a sephacryl s-300 (amersham biosciences, piscataway,
nj) gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0,
0.1 mm dedtc, 0.1 mm edta, and 0.15% c10m. protein fractions
were eluted and then applied to a deae trisacryl (biosepra, marlborough, ma) anion exchange column equilibrated with 20 mm trishcl, ph 8.0, 0.1 mm dedtc, 0.1 mm edta, and 0.15% c10m. the
column was developed with the same buffer, adjusted to ph 5.3.
active fractions were applied to an ultragel aca 54 (biosepra) gel
filtration column equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate, ph
7.4, 0.1 mm dedtc, 0.1 mm edta, and 0.3% n-octyl ␤-d-glucopyranoside. the final material was pooled and stored at ⫺80°c until
use.
baculovirus-infected insect cells expressing recombinant murine
cox-2 were suspended in 25 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 0.25 m sucrose, 1
mm dedtc, and 1 mm edta, washed once, and extracted into the
same buffer containing 1.5% c10m. the extract was centrifuged at
28,000g for 30 min, then applied to a macro-prep high-q (bio-rad,
hercules, ca) anion exchange column equilibrated with 25 mm trishcl, ph 8.0, 0.1 mm dedtc, 0.1 mm edta, and 0.15% c10m and
eluted with a linear gradient to 0.3 m nacl. fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 30-kda molecular mass cutoff membrane and applied to a s-200 sephacryl gel filtration column equilibrated with 25 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 150 mm nacl, 0.1 mm dedtc,
0.1 mm edta, and 0.3% n-octyl ␤-d-glucopyranoside. the active fractions were pooled and stored at ⫺80°c until further use.
antibody preparation. cox-1 murine monoclonal antibody
m584-7f4 and cox-2 murine monoclonal antibody r6 were affinity
purified using protein-a agarose. to cell culture supernatants, sodium borate was added to 100 mm and ph adjusted to 8.9 with
naoh. these were then passed over a protein-a agarose column
(repligen, needham, ma) equilibrated with pbs. initially, the column was washed with 3 m nacl, 100 mm sodium borate, ph 8.9,
then by 3 m nacl, 10 mm sodium borate, ph 8.9. the antibodies
were eluted with 100 mm glycine, ph 3.0. fractions were immediately ph neutralized with the addition of 1/10 (v/v) 1 m tris-hcl, ph
8.1. the antibodies were then dialyzed against pbs and stored at
⫺80°c until use.
cox-2 mutagenesis and expression. site-directed mutagenesis (val523ile, tyr355ala, arg120ala, arg120asp, arg120gln, and
his207ala) and val523ile, arg513his, val434ile (ihi) mutagenesis
on a murine cox-2 pbluescript(⫹) vector (stratagene, la jolla, ca);
subcloning into the mcox-2 pvl1393 baculovirus expression vector
(bd biosciences pharmingen, san diego, ca); and expression by
homologous recombination with baculogold vector (bd biosciences
pharmingen) in sf-9 cells (novagen, madison, wi) was performed as
described previously (rowlinson et al., 1999). purification of the
cox-2 mutants was performed similarly to that described above for
the native murine cox-2 enzyme.
binding assay. cox-1 or cox-2 specific antibodies (m584-7f4 or
r6, respectively)  xxxd1891xxx  ␮g/ml in 100 mm nahco3, ph 8.2, were
coated (100 ␮l/well) onto 96-well immulon 2 microtiter plates (dynex
technologies inc., chantilly, va) by incubating overnight at room
temperature in a humidified chamber. the coated plates were
washed with dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline, without cacl2
and mgcl2, ph 7.4 (d-pbs; invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) and then
treated with a blocking reagent consisting of 10% skim milk in

pocket within the active site. moreover, the isoleucine/valine
difference at position 523 of cox-1/cox-2 seems to contribute significantly to the cox-2 selectivity of members of a new
class of inhibitors, diarylheterocycles (e.g., celecoxib,
sc-236,). replacement of val523 in cox-2 with isoleucine
(val523ile) slows the time-dependent inhibition produced by
some members of the diarylheterocycle class (gierse et al.,
1996; guo et al., 1996; wong et al., 1997). the ile523 of
cox-1 seems to make the side pocket more restrictive and
possibly less accessible than in cox-2.
although specific residues important for binding have been
identified, the relative contribution of these residues to the
kinetics of binding of the diarylheterocycle class has not been
determined. using a fluorescent diarylheterocyclic oxazole,
lanzo et al. (2000) measured the kinetic rate constants for
binding of this oxazole to native cox-1 and cox-2 by fluorescence quenching. furthermore, some elegant attempts
have been made using a mathematical model to discern the
kinetic rate constants for inhibitor binding to cox-1 and
cox-2 (callan et al., 1996; so et al., 1998). in general,
studies have suggested that the slow dissociation of the diarylheterocyclic inhibitors from cox-2 accounts for their selectivity. in this study, using radiolabeled celecoxib and
 xxxd3481xxx , we provide a kinetic analysis of the binding of
these two diarylheterocyclic compounds to cox-1, cox-2,
and several cox-2 variants.

d-pbs (0.2 ml) for 90 to 120 min at 37°c to decrease nonspecific
binding to the plate. the coated and blocked plates were washed,
cox enzyme was added at 20 to 35 ␮g/ml in 50 ␮l of binding buffer
(100 mm tris, 1 ␮m hemin, ph 8.0), and then incubated at room
temperature for 60 to 120 min. finally, these antibody-captured,
enzyme-coated plates were washed with d-pbs and aspirated to
dryness immediately before the binding assay.
for the binding assay, the enzyme-coated plate wells contained 85
␮l of binding buffer, 5 ␮l of  xxxd1896xxx , and 10 ␮l of radiolabeled ligand ([3h] xxxd3481xxx  or [3h]celecoxib), which was added last
at 25°c to initiate the binding reaction. for saturation binding
experiments, various concentrations of either [3h] xxxd3481xxx  (0.3–
3400 nm) or [3h]celecoxib (0.9–350 nm) were added. then, after a 2to 3-h period of incubation, the wells were aspirated, rapidly washed
(⬍2 s) with 250 ␮l of ice-cold d-pbs, and bound radioligand was
quantitated. data were best fit to the equation (rl) ⫽ (r)t (l)/(kd ⫹
l) where (rl) is the amount of bound radiolabeled ligand, (r)t is the
total enzyme concentration, l is the ligand concentration, and kd is
the equilibrium dissociation constant. for dissociation time-course
experiments, the enzyme was initially incubated with radiolabeled
ligand for 120 min. to initiate dissociation, the wells were aspirated,
and 150 ␮l of excess unlabeled ligand (10 ␮m) was added. after
various periods of time, the dissociated radiolabeled compound and
the excess unlabeled compound were removed, and the remaining
bound radioligand was quantitated. data were best fit to the equation (rl) ⫽ (rl)0 e(⫺k ⫻ t) where t is time and k is the dissociation rate
constant. for association time-course experiments, after the addition
of 3h-labeled ligand, the incubations were halted at various time
points by aspiration, rapidly washed, and bound radioactivity was
quantitated. data were best fit using an equation described by rodbard and weiss (1973). lastly, for the competitive binding assays, a
96-well dilution plate was used to initially make dilutions of the
compound. to each of these different concentrations was added a
trace amount of 3h-labeled ligand; then, the complete mixture of
unlabeled test compound and trace radiolabel was added to the
enzyme-coated plate. this method would ensure that there was no
preincubation of either the test compound or the radiolabeled ligand
with the enzyme. ki values were derived from the concentration of
competing compound that inhibited 50% of the binding observed in
the absence of any inhibitor (ic50) using the equation of cheng and
prusoff (1973). in assays in which different cox substrates were
examined, the his207ala variant of cox-2 was employed. in addition, heme was omitted from the assay buffer. other investigators
have shown that the his207ala variant is devoid of peroxidase
activity (landino et al., 1997). data were transformed into logit-log
analysis, and ki values are reported. in all experiments, bound

h-labeled ligand was eluted from the plate using 10% sds in d-pbs

done at room temperature unless otherwise specified. nonspecific

[ h]celecoxib and [ h] xxxd3481xxx  binding to cox-1
and cox-2. the diarylheterocycle compounds [3h]celecoxib
and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  were tested for their ability to specifically
bind to cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes that had been captured
by non-neutralizing antibodies onto a microtiter plate. under
these conditions, enzymatic analysis of both the cox-1- and
cox-2–coated plates, using  xxxd208xxx  as substrate,
revealed that the plates did contain active enzyme sufficient
to produce measurable quantities of  xxxd1903xxx 
(pge2); cox-2 produced 1.4 ng/ml, whereas cox-1 produced
0.9 ng/ml pge2 in 10 min at room temperature with 10 ␮m
 xxxd208xxx . the production of pge2 by cox-1 on the
coated plate could be inhibited by indomethacin, and a phar-

[3h]celecoxib or [3h] xxxd3481xxx  for 120 min at room temperature. the free
unbound radioligand was aspirated off, the plate was rapidly washed,
and the remaining amount bound was determined using liquid scintillation counting. data shown are from one representative experiment using

val523ile with t1/2 of 14 and 5 min, respectively, suggesting
that [3h] xxxd3481xxx  binding is more affected by this particular amino acid substitution. the dissociation rate constants
(k⫺1) from wild-type cox-2, taken in conjunction with the
association rate constants (k⫹1), translate into a kinetically
derived affinity constant (kd ⫽ k⫺1/k⫹1) of 2.4 and 1.6 nm for
[3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx , respectively. these kinetically derived affinity constants are in excellent agreement
with the kd derived from the saturation binding experiments, and further substantiate the high affinity of these
inhibitors for cox-2.
pharmacological characterization of [3h]celecoxib
and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  binding to cox-2. although we have
demonstrated that the binding of [3h]celecoxib and
[3h] xxxd3481xxx  to cox-2 is saturable, reversible, specific, and
of high affinity, the pharmacological relevance of this binding
site remained uncertain. consequently, we tested the ability
of known cox-2 inhibitors and substrates to compete for
binding of these radioligands. some of these inhibitors have
been described as exhibiting time-dependent characteristics
in enzymatic assays. in the binding assay, both the cold
competitor test compound and radiolabeled ligands were
added simultaneously to the enzyme. when substrates were
tested as competitors, we used the his207ala mutant of the
wild-type cox-2, which is devoid of peroxidase activity; thus,
the cyclooxygenase reaction is indirectly prevented as well
(landino et al., 1997). the  xxxd2154xxx  tested, which are
purported to be substrates of cox-2, inhibited the binding of
both [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx ;  xxxd208xxx  was
the most potent (table 1). in addition, all of the nsaids
tested inhibited the binding of either [3h]celecoxib or

[3h] xxxd3481xxx  (5 nm) for various lengths of time. after the incubation
period, the free unbound radioligand was aspirated, the plate was rapidly
washed, and the remaining amount bound was determined using liquid
scintillation counting. data shown are from one representative experiment; k⫹1 ⫽ 4.0 ⫻ 106/m/min.

posed to both cox-1 and cox-2 for 180 min at room temperature. the data show that both [3h]celecoxib and
[3h] xxxd3481xxx  bound to cox-2 in a saturable manner, with
high specificity and low nanomolar affinity, and exhibited
little or no reproducible specific binding to cox-1. in one
experiment, we tested the binding of [3h] xxxd3481xxx  to cox-1
at concentrations up to 3.4 ␮m, and no specific binding to
cox-1 was observed. in the particular experiment shown,
the kd for [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  binding to wildtype cox-2 were 1.9 and 2.1 nm, respectively. scatchard
transformation of the [3h] xxxd3481xxx  binding data (fig. 3)
suggested that the binding was to a single, noninteractive
site and did not suggest the presence of a second binding site
under the conditions of this assay.
to more closely examine the binding of [3h]celecoxib and
3
[ h] xxxd3481xxx  to cox-2, we studied the time courses for
both association and dissociation. kinetic rate constants derived from time-course experiments solidified the results obtained with saturation experiments. furthermore, the results from these experiments may reveal different kinetic
rate constants for compounds that seem to have similar binding affinities. a representative association time course for
[3h] xxxd3481xxx  (5 nm) demonstrates that the ligand binding
to cox-2 reaches steady state within 60 min (fig. 4). in other
similar experiments using [3h]celecoxib, as well as
[3h] xxxd3481xxx , we extended the association time course to
19 h and did not observe any further increase in binding over
that seen at 60 min, either in the presence or absence of an
unlabeled inhibitor (data not shown). both [3h]celecoxib and
[3h] xxxd3481xxx  seemed to have similar association rates (5.8
and 4.5 ⫻ 106/m/min, respectively) for cox-2. dissociation
time-course studies demonstrated that this binding was
slowly but readily reversible. figure 5, a and b, shows the
dissociation time course for both [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  and demonstrates that the binding to cox-2 is readily
reversible with values for t1/2 of 50 and 98 min, respectively.

(gierse et al., 1999). thus, the binding of [3h]celecoxib and
[3h] xxxd3481xxx  seems to be to a single pharmacologically
relevant site.
binding of [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  to
variants of cox-2. various studies have shown that specific residues of cox-2 are critical for the inhibitory potency
of diarylheterocyclics and may be, in part, responsible for the
selectivity of these inhibitors relative to cox-1. consequently, specific residues within the main channel of cox-2
were mutated and the resulting mutated cox-2 enzymes
tested for their ability to bind [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx . diarylheterocycle inhibitors of cox-2 interact with
residues in the cox side pocket, three of which (val523,
arg513, and val434) differ between cox-1 and cox-2. to
closely mimic this region of cox-1, these residues in cox-2
were mutated to the corresponding amino acids of cox-1;
isoleucine, histidine, and isoleucine, respectively (variants
val523ile and ihi). tyr355 is a unique residue in the cyclooxygenase active site because it lies at the entrance to both
the side pocket and the main channel. to evaluate its impact
on inhibitor binding, tyr355 was mutated to alanine
(tyr355ala). because arg120 has been shown to form an ion
pair with all nsaids containing a carboxylate group that
have been visualized crystallographically (picot et al., 1994;
kurumbail et al., 1996) and is thought to form an ion pair
with  xxxd208xxx  (bhattacharyya et al., 1996; smith et
al., 1996; kiefer et al., 2000; malkowski et al., 2000), we also
examined mutants of arg120 (arg120asn, arg120ala, and
arg120gln) to explore their effect on the binding of [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx . the saturation experiments revealed that the binding to all mutants was saturable and
highly specific.
in addition to determining the kd of [3h]celecoxib and
[3h] xxxd3481xxx  by saturation analysis, we determined the
kinetic association and dissociation rate constants for the
binding of these radioligands to the mutant enzymes. [3h]

diarylheterocyclic inhibitor binding to cyclooxygenase

discussion
the ability to develop selective inhibition of cox-2 with
diarylheterocycle compounds has proven beneficial therapeutically. these compounds significantly reduce the risk of gastric ulcerations typically observed with nsaids (simon et
al., 1999; bombardier et al., 2000). in this manuscript, we
directly characterized the binding of two diarylheterocycle
compounds, [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx , to cox-2 and
further established their selective nature. we demonstrated
that they bind in a saturable, highly specific, and readily
reversible manner to a single site that correlates pharmacologically with the cyclooxygenase active site of cox-2. furthermore, we have confirmed the highly selective cox-2
inhibitor profile of [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  by demonstrating their inability to bind specifically to cox-1 within
limits of the assay used. thus, the radioligand binding assay
described here could be used to screen the binding potency of
potential cox-2 inhibitors.
in general, the binding of [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx 
was very similar to both wild-type cox-2 and cox-2 variants. competition experiments with either nsaids or fatty
acid substrates gave comparable results. also, both [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  demonstrate a similar association

strated specific binding to all of the cox-2 mutant enzymes.
in general, mutation of residues near the entrance to the
main channel (tyr355 and arg120) significantly increased
the association rate of both [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx 
binding similarly (6- to 11-fold). also, mutating arg120 to
alanine, glutamine, or asparagine increased the dissociation
rate approximately 2- to 5-fold; the overall net effect of these
increases was a slight, ⬃3-fold increase in affinity. on the
other hand, the side pocket mutations tended to more greatly
affect the dissociation rate than the association rate, with a
greater effect on [3h] xxxd3481xxx  than [3h]celecoxib binding.
for example, the dissociation rate of [3h] xxxd3481xxx  increased nearly 19-fold in val523ile, 25-fold in ihi, and 253fold in tyr355ala but increased only 4-, 2-, and 19-fold,
respectively for [3h]celecoxib binding. dissociation time
courses demonstrated that the binding was also readily reversible as evidenced by the fact that none of the radiolabeled
inhibitor binding had a t1/2 for dissociation of greater than
100 min. when viewed in combination with the association
rate, a kinetically derived affinity constant is determined
that closely matches the kd derived from the saturation
experiments. thus, the binding of [3h]celecoxib and
[3h] xxxd3481xxx  to the cox-2 mutants seems to be saturable,
specific, and readily reversible.

hibitor more sensitive to amino acid differences in the side
pocket between cox isoforms, perhaps contributing to its
increased selectivity relative to celecoxib.
we were unable to detect any reproducible specific binding
of [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  to cox-1 at the concentrations tested. however, because of the high degree of nonspecific binding we observed at the higher concentrations, we
cannot exclude the possibility that these inhibitors may bind
to cox-1 with extremely low affinity (kd ⬎ 1000 nm). this
result is not surprising given the low potency for inhibition of
cox-1 mediated pge2 production that these compounds display (talley et al., 2000). somewhat surprisingly, the triple
mutant of cox-2, ihi, which should mimic cox-1 at the
critical side pocket residues, produced only 3- and 17-fold
decreases in affinity of [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx , respectively. these data suggest that other important differences between cox-1 and cox-2, besides the side pocket,
enhance the selectivity of these diarylheterocycle inhibitors.
one potential area influencing selectivity is near the entrance to the main hydrophobic channel, where arg120,
tyr355, glu524, and helix d reside. when these residues
have been mutated, several studies described dramatic effects on substrates and the potency of inhibitors (greig et al.,
1997; rieke et al., 1999), suicide inactivation (bhattacharyya
et al., 1996), and allosteric activation (so et al., 1998). lanzo
et al. (2000) have described this area as a lobby region in
which two or three stages of interaction with inhibitors could
occur.
in this report, we have characterized the binding of celecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx  to wild-type cox-2 and various mutants of cox-2. however, we could not obtain any specific
binding to wild-type cox-1 using assay conditions that demonstrate high-affinity saturable binding to cox-2. using a
cox-2 mutant (ihi) in which selective substitutions were
designed to hinder side pocket accessibility and mimic
cox-1, we could demonstrate specific binding. these data
suggest that the reduced side pocket volume of cox-1 is not
the only source of diarylheterocycle selectivity. additional
features of cox-2, besides the side pocket, must exist that
impact the specificity and selectivity of cox-2 binding by
this class of inhibitors. we believe that this radioligand binding assay offers both a unique perspective to characterize the
binding of celecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx  and a rapid means in
which potential cox-2 inhibitors may be tested for their
potency.

rate and a very slow dissociation rate from wild-type cox-2.
the dissociation rates, as well as the association rates, we
obtained are in close agreement to those reported by lanzo et
al. (2000) for the diarylheterocycle sc-299 (k⫺1 ⫽ 15 ⫻ 10⫺3/
min and k⫹1 ⫽ 7.2 ⫻ 106/m/min). both of these kinetic rates
for [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  were increased by the
mutation at arg120 to a smaller amino acid; the association
rate was significantly more affected at nearly 10-fold. mutation of arg120 to smaller neutral amino acids may provide
more flexibility at the entrance to the main channel by disrupting the salt bridge between arg120 and glu524, potentially expanding the entrance to the main hydrophobic channel. this could allow more rapid access to the
diarylheterocycle-binding site and give rise to the observed
increase in association rate. if the entrance has been perturbed by these mutants, the increase in association rate
may be somewhat offset by a more rapid dissociation of the
ligand from the binding site because of the loss of van der
waals contacts and loss of the potential ion pair with arg120.
the overall net effect being a slight increase in affinity of
both [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  for the arg120 mutants.
a decrease in affinity for both [3h]celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  was found with the side pocket mutants val523ile and
ihi, compared with wild-type cox-2. these mutations produced little change in the association rate of [3h]celecoxib
and, at most, a 3-fold decrease in the association rate of
[3h] xxxd3481xxx . on the other hand, these side pocket mutations created nearly a 19-fold increase in the dissociation rate
of [3h] xxxd3481xxx , whereas increasing the dissociation rate of
[3h]celecoxib only 2- to 4-fold over wild-type cox-2. the
difference in the magnitude of the effect may be related to the
decrease in volume of the side pockets of the mutants, which
may prevent the optimal binding conformation of the inhibitors from being obtained. so et al. (1998) reported that the
binding of a diarylheterocyclic inhibitor, sc-57666, to a
tyr355phe mutant of cox-2 was rapidly reversible, in contrast to the slow dissociation from wild-type cox-2. similarly, we found the tyr355ala mutant increases both [3h]
celecoxib and [3h] xxxd3481xxx  dissociation rates. the
tyr355ala mutation produced a significantly larger change
in the dissociation rate of [3h] xxxd3481xxx  than [3h]celecoxib,
253- and 19-fold, respectively, consistent with the results of
the val523ile and ihi side pocket mutants. we also observed
a 10-fold increase in the association rate with the tyr355ala
mutant, suggestive of less steric hindrance at the entrance
and easier access to the binding site. thus, the tyrosine-toalanine mutation at position 355 may have the effect of
enlarging both the entrance to the main channel and the
entrance into the side pocket. these kinetic results are consistent with previous reports of the importance of the side
pocket in diarylheterocycle potency and selectivity (gierse et
al., 1996; guo et al., 1996; wong et al., 1997). moreover,
based upon the side pocket and tyr355 mutation results, one
could envision that [3h] xxxd3481xxx  may provide a slightly
greater selectivity for cox-2 over cox-1 than [3h]celecoxib.
because [3h] xxxd3481xxx  has a 5-methyl group on its central
heterocycle, this methyl group would probably contact
tyr355 in the binding site. consequently, mutation at this
position would have a greater impact on the binding of
[3h] xxxd3481xxx  than [3h]celecoxib. these additional contacts
between  xxxd3481xxx  and the side pocket may make that in-
