abstract
the present study examined the role of cyclooxygenase-synthetized prostanoids in the pathogenesis of angiotensin-ii-induced
inflammatory response and vascular injury in transgenic rats harboring mouse renin-2 gene (mren2 rats). five- to six-week-old,
heterozygous mren2 rats received the following drug regimens for 8 weeks: (1) controls; (2)  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor (mf-tricyclic [3(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl) phenyl)-2(5h)-furanone], 14 mg kg 1 p.o.); (3)  xxxg1883xxx / xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor
( xxxd3259xxx , 14 mg kg 1 p.o.); (4)  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonist (losartan 40 mg kg 1 p.o.); (5) mf-tricyclic + losartan; (6)
 xxxd3259xxx  + losartan. normotensive sprague – dawley rats served as controls. mren2 rats developed pronounced hypertension, cardiac
hypertrophy, and albuminuria as compared to normotensive sprague – dawley controls. mren2 rats showed pronounced perivascular
inflammation and morphological damage in the kidneys and the heart. both mf-tricyclic and  xxxd3259xxx  further increased blood pressure and
albuminuria in mren2 rats. neither mf-tricyclic nor  xxxd3259xxx  were able to prevent angiotensin-ii-induced perivascular inflammation and
morphological changes in the heart or in the kidneys. myocardial and renal  xxxg1884xxx  mrna expressions were decreased in mren2
rats, whereas no difference was found in  xxxg1883xxx  mrna expressions.  xxxd3259xxx  increased both  xxxg1883xxx  and
 xxxg1884xxx  gene expressions, whereas mf-tricyclic increased only  xxxg1884xxx  gene expressions. losartan normalized blood
pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, albuminuria, inflammatory response and morphological changes in mren2 rats, both in the presence and
absence of cyclooxygenase inhibitors. our findings indicate that cyclooxygenase does not play a central role in the pathogenesis of
angiotensin-ii-induced inflammatory response and vascular injury in mren2 rats.

1. introduction
the renin – angiotensin –aldosterone system plays a central role in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte
homeostasis. pharmacological blockade of renin – angiotensin – aldosterone system with  xxxg36xxx  inhibitors and  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists
have proved to be effective in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and diabetic vasculopathy (burnier, 2001;
gavras and brunner, 2001; schoolwerth et al., 2001). there
is now accumulating evidence to indicate that  xxxg99xxx ,

the key effector of the renin – angiotensin– aldosterone system, is capable of inducing inflammatory response in the
vascular wall (griendling et al., 2000a,b; romero and
reckelhoff, 1999).  xxxg99xxx  induces vascular inflammation and upregulates the expression of adhesion molecules via angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  stimulation (griendling
et al., 2000a,b; mervaala et al., 1999a; romero and reckelhoff, 1999).  xxxg99xxx  may induce leukocyte infiltration even by blood-pressure-independent mechanisms
(mervaala et al., 2000). previous studies have provided
evidence that angiotensin-ii-induced vascular inflammation
is associated with increased formation of reactive oxygen
species in the vascular smooth muscle cells and myocytes
(griendling et al., 2000a,b; romero and reckelhoff, 1999).
reactive oxygen species influence several cellular processes
including cellular growth, hypertrophy, remodelling, lipid

peroxidation, modulation of vascular tone, and inflammation (alexander, 1995; griendling et al., 2000a,b; irani,
2000; kunsch and medford, 1999). reactive oxygen species
can also act as intracellular signalling molecules regulating
the activation of transcription factors nuclear factor kappa b
(nf-nb) and activating protein-1 (ap-1) and thereby induction of several pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (griendling
et al., 2000a,b; irani, 2000; kunsch and medford, 1999).
prostanoids are local mediators of inflammation and
modulators of physiological functions, including the maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity, the regulation of renal
microvascular hemodynamics, renin release, and tubular
electrolyte and water reabsorption (breyer and harris,
2001; harris, 2000). prostanoids are synthesized from  xxxd208xxx  by cyclooxygenase. two isoforms of cyclooxygenase exist, namely  xxxg1883xxx  and cyclooxygenase2.  xxxg1883xxx  gene is constitutively expressed,
whereas  xxxg1884xxx  is cytokine-inducible and glucocorticoid-inhibited gene that is highly expressed in many
tissues in response to inflammation (breyer and harris, 2001;
harris, 2000). however, constitutive  xxxg1884xxx 
expression also exists in the kidney (breyer and harris,
2001; harris, 2000). previous studies have provided evidence
that  xxxg1884xxx  expression is increased in atherosclerotic lesions (schonbeck et al., 1999) and in myocardium of
patients with congestive heart failure (wong et al., 1998).
however, it remains to be established whether  xxxg1884xxx  overexpression in the vasculature is deleterious or
protective. whereas induction of  xxxg1884xxx  in macrophages and fibroblasts may significantly contribute to
vascular inflammation, injury, and development of fibrosis,
 xxxg1884xxx  overexpression in endothelial cells, leading to increased synthesis of vasoprotective prostacyclin,
may represent a compensatory mechanism to defend against
vascular injury (wu, 1998).
highly selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitors have been
synthesized in order to cause fewer gastrointestinal adverse
events than do the previous traditional nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors (fitzgerald and patrono, 2001). however, only limited information is available on the cardiovascular and renal effects of these compounds and their
interference with the cardiovascular drugs at the pharmacodynamic level. in fact, it has been claimed that the use of
selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitors may even be associated with increased risk of myocardial infarctions (mukherjee et al., 2001).
the present study aimed at exploring whether prostanoids are involved in the pathogenesis of angiotensin-iiinduced vascular inflammation and injury. cardiovascular
and renal effects of selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor
mf-tricyclic, [3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl)
phenyl)-2(5h)-furanone], and a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor  xxxd3259xxx  were examined in transgenic rats
harboring mouse renin-2 gene (tgr[mren2]27, mren2
rats). mren2 rats develop hypertension, vascular inflammation, and end-organ damage apparently due to increased

 xxxg99xxx  formation (bohm et al., 1995; lee et al.,
1996; mullins et al., 1990).

2. materials and methods
2.1. experimental animals, drug regimens, and sample preparation
sixty 5 – 6-week-old male heterozygous mren2 rats
(body weight 212 f 8 g) and 10 age-matched sprague –
dawley rats purchased from m&b (ejby, denmark) were
used. the protocols were approved by the animal experimentation committee of the medical faculty, university of
helsinki, finland, whose standards correspond to those of the
american physiological society. the rats were housed five
animals per cage in a standard experimental animal laboratory (illuminated from 6.30 a.m. until 6.30 p.m., temperature
22 f 1 jc), and they had free access to tap water and chow
(nacl 0.8% w/w, r36, finnewos aqua, helsinki, finland)
during the experiment. in the beginning of the study, the
blood pressure- and body weight-matched mren2 rats were
divided into six groups (10 animals in each) to receive
different drug regimens for 8 weeks: (1) control mren2
rats; (2) mren2 rats receiving a selective  xxxg1884xxx 
inhibitor, mf-tricyclic [3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl) phenyl)-2(5h)-furanone]; (3) mren2 rats receiving a nonselective  xxxg1883xxx / xxxg1884xxx 
inhibitor  xxxd3259xxx ; (4) mren2 rats receiving angiotensin
 xxxg100xxx  antagonist losartan; (5) mren2 rats receiving
mf-tricyclic + losartan; (6) mren2 rats receiving  xxxd3259xxx  +
losartan. normotensive sprague – dawley rats served as
controls. mf-tricyclic,  xxxd3259xxx , and losartan were mixed in
the food to produce approximate daily doses of 14 mg kg 1
mf-tricyclic (buttar et al., 2002; oshima et al., 1996), 14 mg
kg 1  xxxd3259xxx  (buttar et al., 2002; oshima et al., 1996), and
40 mg kg 1 losartan (makino et al., 1997). systolic blood
pressure and heart rate were measured every second week
using a tail cuff blood pressure analyzer (apollo-2ab, blood
pressure analyzer, model 179-2ab, iitc life science,
woodland hills, ca, usa). at the age of 8, 10, 12, and 14
weeks, food intake was recorded and urines collected over 24
h in metabolic cages. rats were then decapitated, blood
samples were taken using edta as anticoagulant, the heart
and kidneys were removed, washed with ice-cold saline,
blotted dry, and weighed. tissue samples were snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen and samples for immunohistochemistry in
isopentane ( 35 jc). all samples were stored at 80 jc
until assayed.
2.2. tissue morphology
samples for conventional morphology were fixed with
10% formalin and processed with routine techniques as
described elsewhere (pere et al., 2000). we relied on a
quantitative grading scale for kidneys viewed by a patholo-

gist unaware of the regimens as follows: (0) normal arteriologlomerular unit with open capillary lumens and a normal
afferent arteriole. arcuate and interlobular vessels normal.
no tubular atrophy or interstitial fibrosis; (1) slight thickening of the media of the afferent arteriole. some mesangial
thickening. open capillary lumens in the glomerulus. minimal medial/adventitial thickening in larger vessels. no signs
of inflammation. (2) marked mesangial thickening partly
collapsed capillaries in the glomerulus. sometimes arterial
thickening. mild peritubular fibrosis. clear medial thickening in larger vessels. no signs of inflammation. (3) focal
glomerulosclerosis with medial thickening of the arteriolar
wall. diffuse tubular atrophy with proteinaceous casts, peritubular fibrosis. sometimes fibrinoid necrosis of larger vessels. occasional inflammatory infiltrate in the interstitium.
(4) focal glomerulosclerosis. concentric hypertrophy and
necrosis of afferent arteries. fibrinoid necrosis of the interlobular and arcuate arteries. atrophic and necrotic tubuli.
peritubular and interstitial fibrosis. interstitial inflammation.
furthermore, for the hearts, the arteries and ventricular
fibrous tissue formation were also evaluated in a blinded
fashion (finckenberg et al., 2001). each sample was scored
from 0 to 3 according to morphologic changes as follows: (0)
epicardial vessels normal. no excessive ventricular connective tissue formation. (1) normal intima. media slightly
thickened or normal. slight increase of connective tissue
around the epicardial and intramuscular arteries. (2) normal
intima. clear medial thickening and adventitial scarring in
epicardial and intramuscular arteries. patchy increase of
slender connective tissue bundles. (3) normal intima. clear
medial thickening and adventitial scarring in epicardial and
intramuscular arteries. evident myocardial scars.
2.3. immunohistochemistry
for immunohistochemistry, formalin-fixed kidneys and
heart were processed as described in detail previously
(mervaala et al., 1999a, 2000). primary monoclonal antibody against rat monocytes/macrophages (ed1) (1:300,
serotec, oxford, england), primary polyclonal antibody
against  xxxg1884xxx  (1:600, cayman chemical, ann
arbor, mi, usa), secondary biotin-conjugated antibodies,
and avidin biotin enzyme reagent (vector laboratories,
burlingame, ca, usa) were used. the sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin before being examined
under a light microscope. the relative amount of primary
antibody positive label per sample was determined with
computerized densitometry (leica im500 and leica qwin
software; leica microsystems, heerbrugg, switzerland).
2.4. reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr) assay of  xxxg1883xxx  mrna and  xxxg1884xxx  mrna
total rna was extracted from the kidneys and heart with
trizol (gibco) reagent, according to the instructions of the

161

manufacturer. after extraction and quantitation with spectrophotometry, a 2-ag aliquot of total rna was reversetranscribed to cdna by incubation for 50 min at 45 jc in the
presence of reverse transcriptase (enhanced avian rt-pcr
kit, sigma, usa). subsequently, 4 al of cdna was subjected
to a rt-pcr for the detection of  xxxg1883xxx  mrna,
 xxxg1884xxx  mrna, and the  xxxg861xxx  mrna (housekeeping gene). samples were amplified using accutaq dna
polymerase (29 cycles, 94 jc 2 min, 62 jc 30 s, 72 jc 45 s
for  xxxg1883xxx , amplified product 304 bp in size; 94
jc 2 min, 60 jc 30 s, 72 jc 45 s for  xxxg1884xxx ,
amplified product 298 bp in size).  xxxg861xxx  amplified product was 198 bp in size. the following rt-pcr primers for
 xxxg861xxx ,  xxxg1883xxx , and  xxxg1884xxx  were
used:  xxxg861xxx  forward, tggggcagcccagaacatca;
 xxxg861xxx  reverse, gccgcctgcttcaccacctt;  xxxg1883xxx  forward, cccatctgttccccagagta;
cyoclooxygenase-1 reverse, gtgagaccccaagttccaaa;  xxxg1884xxx  forward, agtgcctcccactccagact;  xxxg1884xxx  reverse, cactggcttatgccgaaaaa (sigma genosys, united kingdom). the
reaction products were run simultaneously on a 2% agarose gel. the intensity of the resulting bands was measured
by a computer-based imaging analysis system (genetools,
syngene).  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  densities of  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  bands
were expressed as relative to the density obtained for
 xxxg861xxx .
2.5. biochemical determinations
urinary albumin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using rat albumin as a standard
(celltrend, luckenwalde, germany). serum lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) concentrations were measured enzymatically (united laboratories, helsinki, finland).
2.6. drugs
mf-tricyclic [3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl) phenyl)-2(5h)-furanone],  xxxd3259xxx , and losartan
were generous gifts from merck & co. (rahway, nj,
usa).
2.7. statistical analysis
data are presented as means f s.e.m. statistically significant differences in mean values were tested by analysis
of variance (anova) and the least significant difference
(lsd) test. anova for repeated measurements was
applied for data consisting of repeated observations at
successive time points. the differences were considered
significant when p < 0.05. regression lines were calculated
by the least squares method. the data were analyzed using
systat statistical software (systat, evanston, il,
usa).

3. results
3.1. blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart rate
systolic blood pressure was markedly higher in mren2
rats compared to normotensive sprague – dawley rats
(186 f 5 vs. 112 f 4 mm hg, p < 0.05, fig. 1a). both
mf-tricyclic and  xxxd3259xxx  further increased blood pressure
in mren2 rats (215 f 12 and 207 f 7 mm hg, respectively,
p < 0.05 compared to mren2 controls). there was no
difference in blood pressure values between mf-tricyclic
and  xxxd3259xxx  groups. losartan completely normalized blood
pressure in mren2 rats. neither mf-tricyclic nor  xxxd3259xxx 
interfered with the antihypertensive effect of losartan.
mren2 rats showed cardiac hypertrophy, estimated as
absolute heart weights (fig. 1b), or heart weight-to-body

weight ratio (fig. 1c) (both p < 0.05 compared to
sprague – dawley rats). mf-tricyclic and  xxxd3259xxx  tended
further to increase cardiac hypertrophy; however, the
differences reached statistical significance only when
absolute heart weights were used as estimate of cardiac
hypertrophy. losartan completely prevented the development of cardiac hypertrophy, both in the presence and in
the absence of cyclooxygenase inhibitors ( p < 0.05 compared to mren2 controls). there was a close correlation
between systolic blood pressure and the degree of
cardiac hypertrophy ( p < 0.001, r = 0.881, n = 60, fig.
1d).
there was no difference in heart rate between mren2
and sprague – dawley rats (anova p = 0.62). mf-tricyclic,
 xxxd3259xxx , or losartan did not influence heart rate in mren2
rats (data not shown).

fig. 2. bar graphs showing the effects of 8-week treatment with mf-tricyclic,  xxxd3259xxx , and losartan on 24-h albuminuria (panel a), and urine excretion rate
(panel b) in mren2 rats. twenty-four hour albuminuria and urine volume were significantly higher in mren2 compared to sprague – dawley rats. mf-tricyclic
and  xxxd3259xxx  increased albuminuria in mren2 rats. losartan treatment, alone and in combination with cyclooxygenase inhibitors, completely prevented
angiotensin-ii-induced albuminuria as well as angiotensin-ii-induced increase in urine volumes. means f s.e.m. are given, n = 10 in each group. *p < 0.05
compared to untreated mren2 rats, #p < 0.05 compared to mf-tricyclic-treated and  xxxd3259xxx -treated mren2 rats. for abbreviations, see figure legend 1.

3.2. body weight, food intake, and calculated drug dosages
rats gained weight steadily throughout the study. final
body weight was similar in untreated mren2 and sd rats
(412 f 8 vs. 392 f 14 g, p = 0.27). at the end of the

experimental period, body weight in  xxxd3259xxx -treated
(455 f 17 g), losartan-treated (452 f 19 g), and mf-tricyclic + losartan-treated mren2 rats (457 f 15 g) were
slightly, but significantly higher compared to untreated
mren2 ( p < 0.05). there were no differences between

with  xxxd3259xxx  (panel c), and mren2 rat treated with losartan (panel d). profound vascular damage with inflammation and vast myocardial infarcts was
detected in the heart of mren2 rats. losartan, but not cyclooxygenase inhibitors, prevented angiotensin-ii-induced myocardial and vascular damage in
mren2 rats. cardiac damage scores are shown in panel e. values are means f s.e.m., n = 10 in each group. *p < 0.05 compared to untreated mren2 rats,

the treatment groups in the 24-h food intakes at 2, 4, 6, and
8 weeks (anova p>0.05). the average daily food consumption was approximately 25 g per rat. in the 8-week
experimental period, the daily dosage of mf-tricyclic varied
from 22 to 10 mg/kg, that of  xxxd3259xxx  from 25 to 9 mg/kg,
and that of losartan from 67 to 27 mg/kg.
3.3. albuminuria and urine volume
twenty-four hour urine volume and urinary albumin
excretion rate were markedly higher in mren2 rats as
compared to sprague – dawley rats ( p < 0.05, fig. 2a,b).
mf-tricyclic and  xxxd3259xxx  further increased albuminuria in
mren2 rats ( p < 0.05 compared to mren2 controls, fig.
2a). cyclooxygenase inhibitors slightly increased urine
volume. losartan, both in the absence and presence of
cyclooxygenase inhibitors, completely prevented the development of albuminuria, as well as the angiotensin-iiinduced increase in urinary output in mren2 rats (all
p < 0.05 compared to mren2 controls).
3.4. heart and kidney morphology
myocardium of mren2 rats showed severe histopathological changes (fig. 3a). in larger epicardial arteries, there

were notable adventitial fibrosis and medial hypertrophy.
there was an increase of inflammatory cells in the perivascular area. smaller, mostly intramuscular arteries were even
more severely damaged, and showed concentric hypertrophy occluding the vessels. signs of myocardial infarctions
were noted. neither mf-tricyclic nor  xxxd3259xxx  had clear
beneficial or detrimental effects on cardiac morphology
(fig. 3b,c). in contrast, losartan completely prevented the
angiotensin-ii-induced morphological changes in mren2
rats, both in the presence and in the absence of cyclooxygenase inhibitors (fig. 3d,e). serum lactate dehydrogenase concentrations between mren2 and sprague –
dawley rats were similar ( p = 0.97), and the drugs used
did not influence it (data not shown).
the kidneys of mren2 rats showed focal glomerulosclerosis with mesangial expansion, and apparent tubular
atrophy with mild peritubular/interstitial fibrosis (fig. 4a).
the mid-sized arteries had notable adventitial and medial
thickening whereas the smaller arteries had also intimal
hyperplasia leading to narrowing of the luminal space.
inflammatory cells were found in the periarterial and peritubular areas. neither mf-tricyclic nor  xxxd3259xxx  were able to
prevent angiotensin-ii-induced changes in renal morphology
(fig. 4b,c). in contrast, some samples of cyclooxygenase
inhibitor groups showed necrosis of the tubular epithelium.

with mesangial proliferation, glomerular sclerosis and necrosis, increased intimal and media thickness, and deposition of matrix. losartan, but not cyclooxygenase
inhibitors, prevented angiotensin-ii-induced renal damage in mren2 rats. kidney damage scores are shown in panel e. values are means f s.e.m., n = 10 in each

renal morphology in mren2 rats treated with losartan was
indistinguishable from that of sprague – dawley rats (fig.
4d,e).
3.5. immunohistochemistry
mren2 rats showed perivascular monocyte/macrophage
infiltration (ed-1 immunopositive cells) especially in the
kidneys (fig. 5), and to a lesser extent in the heart (ed-1
immunopositive surface area 0.031 f 0.008% in mren2
rats compared to 0.015 f 0.003% in sprague –dawley rats,
p < 0.05). neither mf-tricyclic nor  xxxd3259xxx  ameliorated
inflammatory response in mren2 rats (fig. 5). losartan
completely prevented leukocyte infiltration in mren2 rats
(fig. 5).
in the kidneys, a weak  xxxg1884xxx  immunopositive staining was found in the cortex and medullary
interstitial cells. renal  xxxg1884xxx  expression was

165

decreased in mren2 compared to sprague –dawley rats
( xxxg1884xxx  immunopositive surface area 1.2 f
0.17% and 2.1 f 0.34%, respectively, p < 0.05). in the heart
of mren2 and sprague – dawley rats, only minimal  xxxg1884xxx  expression was found in endothelial cells (data
not shown).
3.6.  xxxg1883xxx  mrna and  xxxg1884xxx  mrna
expressions
as compared to sprague –dawley rats, cyclooxygenase2 mrna expression in mren2 rats was decreased by 80%
in the heart (fig. 6a) and by 60% in the kidneys (fig. 6b).
mf-tricyclic,  xxxd3259xxx , and losartan significantly increased
myocardial and renal  xxxg1884xxx  mrna expressions
( p < 0.05 compared to mren2 controls).
there was no difference in  xxxg1883xxx  mrna
expression in the heart (fig. 6c) or kidneys (fig. 6d) between

the kidneys of untreated mren2 rats kidneys showed severe perivascular inflammation. neither mf-tricyclic nor  xxxd3259xxx  significantly ameliorated

4. discussion
transgenic rats harboring mouse renin-2 (mren2) rats
are characterized by hypertension and angiotensin-iiinduced tissue injury in the brain, heart, kidneys, and
vasculature (bohm et al., 1995; lee et al., 1996; mullins et
al., 1990). there is accumulating evidence indicating that
inflammatory response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of angiotensin-ii-induced end-organ damage. the
present study aimed at exploring whether cyclooxygenase-

synthetized prostanoids are involved in the pathogenesis of
angiotensin-ii-induced inflammatory response and vascular
injury in mren2 rats. the important finding of the present
study was that neither nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor
 xxxd3259xxx  nor  xxxg1884xxx  selective mf-tricyclic was
capable of preventing angiotensin-ii-induced inflammatory
response or tissue damage. in contrast, both compounds
showed clear blood-pressure-increasing effect and further
aggravated angiotensin-ii-induced renal damage. rt-pcr
gene expression analysis revealed that  xxxg1884xxx 
mrna expression was downregulated by  xxxg99xxx 
both in the kidney and heart. although cyclooxygenase
inhibitors exerted detrimental cardiovascular and renal
effects in mren2 rats, they did not attenuate the therapeutic
effects of angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonist losartan.
taken together, our findings indicate that cyclooxygenase

z.j. cheng et al. / european journal of pharmacology 461 (2003) 159–169

does not play a central role in the pathogenesis of angiotensin-ii-induced vascular inflammation and injury in mren2
rats.
long-term clinical use of nonselective cyclooxygenase
inhibitors is limited by gastrointestinal side effects such as
dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and less frequently, duodenal or
gastric ulcers. in contrast, selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitors have demonstrated improved gastrointestinal safety
and tolerability (fitzgerald and patrono, 2001). however,
recent clinical studies have suggested that  xxxg1884xxx 
inhibitors may increase the risk of cardiovascular events,
e.g. through increased blood pressure or decreased endothelial prostacyclin production (fitzgerald and patrono,
2001; mukherjee et al., 2001). in the present study, we
found that both the nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor
 xxxd3259xxx  as well as the  xxxg1884xxx -selective mftricyclic increased systolic blood pressure by 20 to 30 mm
hg in mren2 rats. we were unable to detect any significant
difference between the two drug treatments. the bloodpressure-increasing effect of cyclooxygenase inhibitors was
noted already after 4 weeks of treatment. an important
finding of the present study was the close correlation
between systolic blood pressure and the degree of cardiac
hypertrophy in mren2 rats, suggesting that the development of cardiac hypertrophy in mren2 rats is primarily
mediated by increased pressure overload. although cyclooxygenase inhibitors increased blood pressure and slightly
augmented cardiac hypertrophy in mren2 rats, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial morphology as well as serum
lactate dehydrogenase concentrations were unaltered by the
two cyclooxygenase inhibitors. our findings thus do not
provide any evidence for further aggravation of angiotensinii-induced myocardial or vascular lesions by cyclooxygenase inhibitors.
the kidneys exhibit abundant constitutive expression of
both  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  (breyer and
harris, 2001; harris, 2000). mice with targeted disruption of
the  xxxg1884xxx  gene, as well as mice treated with a
selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor, showed renal dysgenesis (kömhoff et al., 2000), suggesting an important role of
 xxxg1884xxx  in renal development. in the kidney,
 xxxg1884xxx  is predominantly expressed in the macula
densa, cortical thick ascending limb of henle, as well as in
the medullary interstitial cells. although the physiological
role of  xxxg1884xxx  in the kidney is not fully understood, several studies support the notion that renal  xxxg1884xxx  may regulate renin release as well as renal
microcirculation in response to environmental factors such
as salt and water depletion (breyer and harris, 2001; harris,
2000). previous studies have shown that  xxxg99xxx  is a
central regulator of renal hemodynamics and renal electrolyte and water excretion (cowley, 1992). we have shown
previously in transgenic rats harboring both human renin
and  xxxg99xxx  genes that  xxxg99xxx  decreases
renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and increases
tubular sodium reabsorption via angiotensin  xxxg100xxx 

167

stimulation (mervaala et al., 1999b). infusions of physiological amounts of  xxxg99xxx  also causes marked
reduction in renal blood flow with or without any changes
in glomerular filtration rate (hall and guyton, 1990). recent
studies have provided compelling evidence that endothelialand vascular smooth muscle cell-derived vasodilatory prostanoids attenuate the renal vascular response to angiotensin
ii (imig, 2000). interestingly, qi et al. (2002) demonstrated
very recently that  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx 
exert opposite effects on the pressor response to angiotensin
ii, and that vasodilatory prostaglandins ( xxxd1903xxx 
and prostaglandin i2) derived from  xxxg1884xxx , effectively counteract the pressure effect of  xxxg99xxx . in the
present study, both cyclooxygenase inhibitors markedly
increased angiotensin-ii-induced renal damage when estimated by 24-h albuminuria. we further evaluated the renal
effects of cyclooxygenase inhibitors by scoring the tissue
damage. perivascular inflammation, glomerular sclerosis
with mesangial expansion, and interstitial fibrosis were
found in the kidneys of mren2 rats. we did not notice
any statistically significant increases in renal damage score
by cyclooxygenase inhibitors. however, a tendency toward
more frequent existence of evident tubular necrosis was
noted in kidney samples taken from cyclooxygenase-treated
mren2 rats. taking into consideration the major role of
kidney in the long-term regulation of blood pressure, we
speculate that the blood-pressure-increasing effect of cyclooxygenase inhibitors in mren2 rats is likely to be due to
derangement in renal microcirculation and tissue damage.
mren2 rats develop hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy,
and renal damage due to increased  xxxg99xxx  formation
in tissues and circulation (bohm et al., 1995; lee et al., 1996;
mullins et al., 1990). we showed recently that  xxxg99xxx 
induces tissue damage even by blood-pressure-independent
mechanisms (mervaala et al., 2000).  xxxg99xxx  generates reactive oxygen species, activates redox-sensitive transcription factors  xxxg1559xxx  and ap-1, and induces severe
perivascular inflammation and adhesion molecule overexpression through angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  stimulation (luft
et al., 1999). both  xxxg1883xxx - and cyclooxygenase2-derived prostanoids play an important role in mediating
and terminating inflammatory response (breyer and harris,
2001; imig, 2000; harris, 2000; mitchell et al., 1995).
 xxxg1884xxx  can be induced in endothelial cells,
fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages by proinflammatory cytokines, endotoxin, prostanoids, tumor promoters, mitogens, and hypoxia (mitchell et al., 1995; wu,
1995). interestingly, treatment with  xxxg1884xxx -selective inhibitors like ns398 and celecoxib, but not with
indomethacin, severely diminished early and late events of
t cell activation, partly through nf-nb- and nuclear factor of
activated t cells (nfat)-transcription pathways, supporting
the notion that selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitors might
act as modulators of the immune system (iniguez et al.,
1999). however, anti-inflammatory effects of  xxxg1884xxx -derived prostanoids have also been described (gilroy

168

z.j. cheng et al. / european journal of pharmacology 461 (2003) 159–169

et al., 1999). interestingly, it has also been claimed that
 xxxg1884xxx  induction in endothelial cells may represent an important compensatory mechanism to defend
against vascular injury (wu, 1998). in the present study,
we estimated the degree of angiotensin-ii-induced inflammatory response by quantifying the ed-1-immunopositive
cells. ed-1 antibody detects mainly monocytes and macrophages. consistent with the previous studies (mervaala et al.,
1999a, 2000; romero and reckelhoff, 1999),  xxxg99xxx 
induced a marked monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the
kidneys and to a lesser extent in the heart. we were unable to
detect any anti-inflammatory effects by cyclooxygenase
inhibitors, suggesting that cyclooxygenase does not play a
central role in the pathogenesis of angiotensin-ii-induced
inflammatory response.
in mren2 rats,  xxxg1884xxx  mrna expression
both in the heart and kidneys were downregulated, whereas
angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  blockade by losartan increased
 xxxg1884xxx  gene expression. regulation of  xxxg1884xxx  protein expression by renin – angiotensin –aldosterone system was also noted with  xxxg1884xxx 
immunohistochemistry. our findings are thus in good agreement with previous studies (breyer and harris, 2001; cheng
et al., 1999; harris, 2000) and indicate an important role for
 xxxg99xxx  in the regulation of  xxxg1884xxx  gene
expression in vivo. selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibition
induced only  xxxg1884xxx  mrna expression, whereas
nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibition increased the gene
expression of both  xxxg1883xxx  and cyclooxygenase2. our findings thus indicate that cyclooxygenase genes are
compensatory induced after chronic enzyme inhibition.
previous studies have revealed that angiotensin-iiinduced hypertension is associated with pronounced inflammatory response in the vascular wall (griendling et al.,
2000a,b; luft et al., 1999; mervaala et al., 1999a; romero
and reckelhoff, 1999). in contrast, perivascular inflammation, adhesion molecule overexpression, and increased formation of reactive oxygen species are typically not found in
spontaneously hypertensive rats, the most common animal
model for essential hypertension, or in noradrenalineinduced hypertension (hilgers et al., 2000; pinto et al.,
1997; rajagopalan et al., 1996; strawn et al., 1999). in fact,
inflammatory response in mren2 rats as well as in double
transgenic rats harboring human renin and human  xxxg99xxx  genes is partly mediated by blood-pressure-independent mechanisms through angiotensin  xxxg100xxx 
pathway (mervaala et al., 2000; strawn et al., 1999).
although mren2 rats offer a unique opportunity to study
the role of cyclooxygenase-synthetized prostanoids in the
pathogenesis of angiotensin-ii-induced inflammatory response and vascular injury, the transgenic animal model
used in the present study may also have some limitations.
since the transfected mouse renin-2 gene is not under
physiological control, changes in dietary salt intake or cyclooxygenase inhibition are unlike to modulate the renin
expression in mren2 rats. it is therefore of importance to

underline that the findings and conclusions of the present
study should be limited only to mren2 rats. further clinical
studies examining the cardiovascular and renal effects of
cyclooxygenase inhibition, and in particular the interaction
with increased renin – angiotensin –aldosterone system activity, are therefore warranted.
in conclusion, our findings indicate that cyclooxygenase
does not play a central role in the pathogenesis of angiotensin-ii-induced inflammatory response and development of
angiotensin-ii-induced end-organ damage in mren2 rats.
