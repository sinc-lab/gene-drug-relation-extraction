summary. aminochrome was found to be toxic in a mouse-derived neuronal
cell line (cnh). the effect was concentration dependent (10–150µm). the
issue whether aminochrome toxicity involves glutamate transmission was
studied with several glutamate receptors antagonists. incubation of the cells
with aminochrome (150µm) in the presence of 100µm of the ampa antagonist, nbqx resulted in an increase of cell survival, from 52 to 73%.
however, this protective effect did not seem to be related to activation of
ionotropic glutamate receptors since incubation of cnh cells with 200µm of
glutamate resulted in only 10% decrease of cell survival. however, nbqx
was found to inhibit in vitro the autoxidation process. one hundred µm  xxxd1353xxx  did not have any effect on aminochrome toxicity. the toxic effect of
aminochrome on cnh cells seems to be dependent of extracellular activation
since addition of  xxxd1875xxx , a specific inhibitor of dt- xxxg641xxx , did not
affect that toxicity, which can be explained perhaps by a lack of a transport
system for aminochrome into the cnh cells.

excitotoxicity
introduction
a relationship among free radicals and excitatory amino acids transmission
has been suggested (zeman et al., 1994). excitatory amino acid receptoractivation results in the generation of harmful free radicals (pazdernik et al.,
1992) and these in turn can enhance excitatory amino acid release (pellegrinigiampietro et al., 1990). the overexpression of cu-zn-superoxide dismutase
in transgenic mice significantly reduces glutamate neurotoxicity (chan et al.,
1990), and the inhibition of the free radical-generating enzyme xanthine

364

c. arriagada et al.

oxidase protects the olfactory cortex from excitotoxic injuries induced
by kainic acid (facchinetti et al., 1992; dykens et al., 1987). mannitol, a
scavenger of hydroxyl radicals, has been reported to protect cerebellar
neurons from kainate-induced death (dykens et al., 1987). carvedilol, a
antihypertensive agent, has been found to inhibit lipid peroxidation and also
to provide protection against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity (lysko et al.,
1992). furthermore, the antioxidants,  xxxd3521xxx  and  xxxd2213xxx 
(gsh) have been reported to provide protection against glutamate-induced
excitotoxicity on pc12 cells (pereira and oliveira, 1997), and melatonin has
showed protective effects against the elevation of lipid peroxidation induced
by either kainate or nmda (kim and kwon, 1999).
the possible role of reactive oxygen species generated during oneelectron reduction of aminochrome in the activation of ionotropic glutamate
receptors is an open question. one-electron reduction of aminochrome
to leukoaminochrome o-semiquinone radical has been suggested to be the
reaction responsible for the formation of reactive oxygen species in the
neurodegenerative process of the dopaminergic system in parkinson’s disease
(baez et al., 1995; segura-aguilar et al., 1998; segura-aguilar et al., 1999).
leukoaminochrome o-semiquinone is very reactive with oxygen, resulting in
the reduction of dioxygen to superoxide radicals. dt- xxxg641xxx  has been
proposed to play a neuroprotective role in the presence of superoxide
dismutase and catalase by preventing the autoxidation and the redox cycling
process during aminochrome metabolism (segura-aguilar and lind, 1989;
baez et al., 1995). one-electron quinone reductases and dt- xxxg641xxx 
compete to reduce aminochrome to leukoaminochrome o-semiquinone
and leukoaminochrome (the products of one- and two-electron reduction),
respectively.
we have recently developed a cell line (cnh) from mouse cerebral cortex
expressing several neuronal properties observed in vivo, including nmethyl-d-aspartate (nmda) and 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4yl) xxxd3029xxx  (ampa)/kainate receptors. cnh cells exhibit increments of
intracellular ca21 in response to externally administered glutamate, nmda,
ampa and kainate (cardenas et al., 1999). thus, we have used this cell line
to study if the mechanism of aminochrome neurotoxicity includes that of
activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors. the role of one and two-electron
reduction of aminochrome in the activation of these receptors and cellular
localization of aminochrome activation was also studied.
material and methods
chemicals
dopamine, dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (dmem), nutrient mixture ham
f-12, 6-nitro 7-sulfamobenzo(f)quinoxaline-2,3-dione (nbqx) and 2-amino-5phosphonopentanoic acid (ap-5) were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st louis,
mo, usa). 3h-dopamine was from amersham (england) and 3h-choline was from
nen (boston, usa). aminochrome was prepared by oxidizing dopamine with mn31pyrophosphate complex according to segura-aguilar and lind, 1989. 3h-aminochrome

was prepared by oxidizing 3h-dopamine in the presence of excess of mn31-pyrophosphate
complex. the mn31-pyrophosphate complex was prepared according to archibald and
fridovich (1982).

cell culture
the cnh cell line was originally prepared from cerebral cortex dissected from mouse
fetuses. the cells are positive to several neuronal markers such as  xxxg1360xxx , cynaptophysin,
neuron specific enolase (nse), choline acetyl transferase by immunohistochemistry
and lack glial traits, such as glial hibrillary acidic protein (gsap), s-100 and galacto
 xxxd3235xxx , after almost 2 years in continuous culture (cardenas et al., 1999). cnh cells
were seeded in 35 mm plastic petri dishes to get density of 5,000 cells/cm2. the culture
medium consisted of dmem/ham f12 nutrient mixture (1 : 1) containing 6 g/l glucose,
10% bovine serum, 1 g/l bicarbonate, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 40 µg/ml gentamicine
(cardenas et al., 1999). the cultures were kept in an incubator at 37°c with 100%
humidity and an atmosphere of 10% co2. the toxicity experiments were performed in
the absence of bovine serum and the dishes were incubated during 120 min.
aminochrome was formed by mixing 150 µm dopamine with 4 mm manganese31pyrophosphate before been applied to the cells medium. in the experiments with different
concentrations of aminochrome the ratio of dopamine to manganese was correspondly
modified. toxicity was measured by marking five squares of 1 3 1 mm under the petri dish
before the cells were seeded. the cells were counted under contrast microscopy in the
marked areas before and after the treatments. after the treatments trypan blue was
added to the plate before the second counting. the incorporation of trypan blue to the
cells and the cell detached from the plate was considered to indicate toxicity. the amount
of positive cells was then compared to the total counts prior to the incubation periods with
the corresponding toxic agents.

rt-pcr
the total rna was isolated by using a rneasy kit (qiagen). one µg of the total rna
was used for the synthesis of the single strand dna with the reverse transcriptase
reaction during 50 min at 42°c. the primers were designed from the cdna sequence of
dt- xxxg641xxx  (ec 1.6.99.2) reported by bayney et al. (1989). the amplification of
ssdna of dt- xxxg641xxx  was performed by pcr reaction using the following primers
59cagaaacgacatcacaggggag-39 (upstream) and 59 caagcactctct
caaaccagcc-39 (downstream). the pcr reaction was performed in three steps: (i)
95°c for 5 min; (ii) one cycle at 94°c for 40 sec, 65°c for 45 sec, 72°c for 1 min, and eleven
cycles with the annealing temperature decreased one degree/cycle from 65°c until 55°c;
(iii) 30 cycles at 94°c for 40 sec, 62°c for 45 sec, 72°c for 1 min. the pcr incubation
contained 8 µl of rt-incubation, 0.2 mm dntp each, 1.5 µm mgcl2, 0.5 µm primers, 5 µl
10x pcr-buffer (gibcobrl), 29 µl h2o and 1 u taq polimerasa (gibcobrl). the
region amplified by pcr was between the bases 230 and 438, which resulted in a fragment
of 209 bp (bayney et al., 1989).

tracer uptake into cnh cells
the uptake of 3h-dopamine and 3h-aminochrome into cnh cells was measured according
to allen et al. (1997) with slight modifications. 3h-dopamine and 3h-aminochrome (1 µci)
were added to each dish and the uptake was assessed after an incubation period of 10 min
at 37°c in krebs medium. the final concentration of dopamine and aminochrome was
100 µm. at the end of the uptake period, extracellular medium was removed and the cells

366

c. arriagada et al.

were rapidly washed 5 times with 2 ml ice-cold krebs medium to remove residual 3htracers. cell membranes were disrupted with 1 ml of 1% triton x-100 and after 3 minutes
incubation 900 ul of the cell/triton x-100 extract was removed and analyzed for 3h-tracer
content by liquid scintillation counting. the protein concentration was measured according to smith et al. (1985) (pierce, rockford, il, usa). control experiments were performed with 1 µci 3h-choline (nen dupont, boston, usa) (100 µm final concentration).
the results are expressed in nmole/mg protein/10 min).

dt- xxxg641xxx  activity
dt- xxxg641xxx  was determined according to ernster et al. (1962) by measuring the
reduction of nadh at 340 nm. the cells were sonicated in 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5,
during 10 sec and centrifugated  xxxd1891xxx ,000 xg for 20 min. the enzyme activity was measured
in the pellet and supernatant fraction. the incubation contained 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5,
0.08% triton x100, 500 µm nadh, 77 µm  xxxg569xxx , 10 µm  xxxd2563xxx . after
obtaining the initial rate, 10 µm  xxxd1875xxx  was added to inhibit dt- xxxg641xxx  completly (beyer et al., 1987).

results
incubation of cnh cells with 150µm dopamine during 2h resulted in a low
but statistically significant 7% decrease of survival (fig. 1). the addition of
150µm aminochrome to the incubation mixture resulted in 48% decrease of
cell survival (fig. 1a). the toxic effect of aminochrome was found to be
concentration dependent as shown in fig. 1b.
a possible involvement of activation of glutamate ionotropic receptors in
the observed cytotoxic effects of aminochrome was investigated by incubating
cnh cells with ap-5 or nbqx antagonists to nmda and ampa/kainate
receptors, respectively, and 150µm aminochrome. it was found that 100µm
nbqx produced a significant increase of survival, from 52 to 73% (table 1).
100µm ap-5 did not have any effect on aminochrome toxicity. furthermore,
a concentration of 200µm glutamate, which induced a rapid and transient
increase in [ca21] in cnh cells (cardenas et al., 1999) produced only a 10%
decrease of survival, which was not affected by nbqx (table 1a).
the possibility that inhibitory effect of nbqx on aminochrome toxicity
was due to a scavenger property of this antagonist was also investigated. this
idea was tested by using the reductive activation of aminochrome with dtdiaphorase to leukoaminochrome in vitro. we added 100µm nbqx to an
incubation mixture containing 30µm aminochrome, 500µm nadh and 1µg
dt- xxxg641xxx  in 50mm phosphate buffer (ph 6.5). the autoxidation was
recorded by following the continous nadh oxidation at 340nm. it was found
that 100µm of nbqx completely inhibited the autoxidation process of
aminochrome by dt- xxxg641xxx  (not shown).
to study whether aminochrome toxicity was dependent on one- or twoelectron reductive activation,  xxxd1875xxx  was added to the culture medium
finding that 50µm  xxxd1875xxx  had no effect on aminochrome toxicity (fig.
2a). the lack of effect of  xxxd1875xxx  on aminochrome toxicity opened
questions regarding (i) the expression of dt- xxxg641xxx  in cnh cells, and (ii)
the location of the metabolic activation of aminochrome.

fig. 2. expression of dt- xxxg641xxx  mrna in cnh cells. the expression of dtdiaphorase mrna was determined by using rt-pcr as described under materials and
methods

the mrna expression of dt- xxxg641xxx  in cnh cells was determined by
using a rt-pcr technique. figure 3 shows that the dt- xxxg641xxx  mrna
was expressed in cnh cells. in addition, the enzymatic activity of dtdiaphorase was also determined. the enzymatic activity in the 10,000xg pellet
was 43nmole/min/mg protein and in the 10,000xg supernatant was 546nmole/
min/mg.
the lack of effect of  xxxd1875xxx  could be explained by an extracelular
reduction of aminochrome and further uptake into the cells. to answer this
possibility we performed uptake experiments of 3h-dopamine and 3haminochrome into cnh cells. table 1 shows that there was a low transport for
both 3h-dopamine and 3h-aminochrome, as compared to 3h-choline in cnh
cells. the observed uptake of 3h-dopamine was 35-fold lower than that of
3
h-choline after 10min. in addition, about 97% of the total 3h-dopamine or
3
h-aminochrome was found in the extracellular fraction (not shown).
another experiment to demonstrate that aminochrome was extracellularly reduced to reactive oxygen species was that of inhibiting this
metabolic activation by adding pure dt- xxxg641xxx  to the medium in the
presence or absence of superoxide dismutase and catalase. the presence of
dt- xxxg641xxx , superoxide dismutase and catalase inhibited the amino-

alone or superoxide dismutase and catalase together decreased the toxic
effects of aminochrome by approximately 50% and 30%, respectively (fig.
3b).
discussion
activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors (nmda and ampa/kainate)
induces excitoxicity by increasing the ca21 influx, thus impairing ca21
homeostasis (meldrum and garthwaite, 1990). a link between excitotoxicity
and free radical has been proposed (pazdernik et al., 1992). antioxidants and/
or antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, have been
reported to inhibit glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity (dykens et al., 1987;
pereira and oliveira, 1997; kim and kwon, 1999; chen et al., 1990).
previous reports have linked the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of
dopamine in cell cultures to activation of glutamate receptors, since the toxic
effects of dopamine can be inhibited by antagonist to nmda receptors ( xxxd1353xxx ) (zhang et al., 1998; lieb et al., 1995; cheng et al., 1996). however, no effect
of nmda (mk-801) or non-nmda (cnqx) antagonists has been found on
dopamine-dependent toxicity of striatal neurons (cheng et al., 1996).

fig. 4. possible mechanism of toxicity of aminochrome in cerebral cortex neurons.
aminochrome is activated extracellularly to reactive oxygen species by flavoenzymes
present in the cell membrane using electrons from intracellullar nadh or nadph.
aminochrome is exclusively reduced by one-electron transfer flavoenzymes to
leukoaminochrome o- xxxd309xxx  since dt- xxxg641xxx  is mainly located in the
cytosol and associated to mitochondria and endoplasmatic reticulum. formation of
leukoaminoachrome o- xxxd309xxx  gives rise a redox cycling proccess resulting
in the formation of large amounts of superoxide which dismutate and form hydrogen
peroxide.  xxxd2298xxx  is a precursor of hydroxyl radicals, which react with the
majority of biomolecules. this redox cycle will deplete nadh required for atp formation and/or deplete nadph required for reduction of  xxxd2811xxx  to gsh, which is an
important antioxidant. the inhibitory effect of nbqx on aminochrome seems to be due
to its ability to inhibit the redox cycling process

although, ap-5 has been reported to prevent dopamine-dependent toxicity
in female, but not in male dopaminergic neurons (lieb et al., 1995). the
mechanism of cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of dopamine has been proposed
to be linked to dopamine oxidation and its reduction to leukoaminochrome osemiquinone radical and formation of reactive oxygen species (baez et al.,
1995; segura-aguilar et al., 1998).
the possibility that aminochrome-dependent toxicity is mediated via a
glutamate mechanism was studied in experiments with cnh cells. this cell

line has been proposed to be a useful tool for investigating dopamine-related
toxicity (cardenas et al., 1999). the phenotype of this cell line is neuronal,
expressing receptors for severals putative neurotransmitters including
glutamate and, in agreement, it has been found that 60–300µm glutamate
induces a rapid and transient increase in ca21 concentration (cardenas et al.,
1999). in the present study, it was observed that the presence of nbqx
produced an increase in the survival of cells treated with aminochrome (table
1a). it seems plausible that the metabolic activation of aminochrome to
leukoaminochrome o-semiquinones initiate a toxic process and that the
reactive oxygen species formed during the redox cycling of aminochrome
targeted the cell membrane allowing a release of glutamate, activating
nmda and ampa/kainate receptors. however, incubation of cnh cells
with 200µm glutamate showed only a slight decrease in cell survival (10%). in
addition, nbqx did not appear to modify the effect of glutamate. a possible
explanation to the lack of toxic effects of glutamate is that higher
concentrations and longer time of incubation are required to induce toxicity,
as reported previously (pereira and oliveira, 1997). furthermore, it was
found that nbqx inhibited the autoxidation and redox cycling process in
vitro when aminochrome was reduced by dt- xxxg641xxx .
no specific transport of aminochrome was observed in cnh cells (table
2), suggesting that aminochrome may act extracellulary, and therefore not
available for dt- xxxg641xxx , which is considered to be an intracellular
enzyme (ernster et al., 1962). the addition of pure dt- xxxg641xxx  together
with superoxide dismutase and catalase showed to inhibit aminochrome
toxicity, which is in agreement with previous reports (segura-aguilar and
lind, 1989; baez et al., 1995). these results support the idea that one-electron
reduction of aminochrome is involved in the decrease of cnh cell survival
observed in the presence of aminochrome. it seems plausible that
flavoenzymes located in the outer membrane transfer electrons received from
intracellular nadh or nadph to extracellular aminochrome. redox
cycling of extracellular aminochrome catalyzed by flavoenzyme(s) may result
in the formation of reactive oxygen species and leukoaminochrome osemiquinone. these reactive oxygen species may induce lipid peroxidation,
deactivation of enzymes, oxidation of thiol groups in proteins and reaction
with nucleophiles.

although, the mechanism of aminochrome toxicity in cnh cells seems to
be independent of glutamate receptors, the possible involvement of glutamate
receptors cannot be discarded. evidently, further experiments have to be
performed for exploring this hypothesis.
