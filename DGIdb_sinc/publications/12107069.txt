channels are composed of pore-forming kir6.x subunits and
regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (sur) subunits. surs are
atp-binding cassette proteins with two nucleotide-binding
folds (nbfs) and binding sites for sulfonylureas, like  xxxd2215xxx , and for channel openers. here we report the identification and functional characterization of four novel splice
forms of guinea pig  xxxg19xxx . three splice forms originate from
alternative splicing of the region coding for nbf1 and lack
exons 17 ( xxxg19xxx ⌬17), 19 ( xxxg19xxx ⌬19), or both ( xxxg19xxx ⌬17⌬19).
the fourth (sur1c) is a cooh-terminal  xxxg19xxx -fragment
formed by exons 31–39 containing the last two transmembrane segments and the cooh terminus of  xxxg19xxx . rt-pcr
analysis showed that these splice forms are expressed in
several tissues with strong expression of sur1c in cardiomyocytes. confocal microscopy using enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged sur or kir6.x did not provide any
evidence for involvement of these splice forms in the mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx . only  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg19xxx ⌬17 showed
high-affinity binding of  xxxd2215xxx  (kd⬇ 2 nm in the
presence of 1 mm atp) and formed functional katp channels
upon coexpression with  xxxg1250xxx .

the metabolic state of a cell to excitability: cytosolic
atp inhibits katp channels, whereas cytosolic mgadp
activates these channels. katp channels are involved
in many physiological processes including insulin secretion by pancreatic ␤ cells, regulation of vascular
tone, and neuronal excitability. the molecular components of katp channels have been cloned (1, 22, 23, 25),
and the channel has been identified as an octameric
assembly of four channel-forming kir6.x subunits and
four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (sur) subunits
(14, 45). the kir6.x subunits belong to the family of
inwardly rectifying potassium channels. the sur is a
member of the atp-binding cassette (abc) superfam-

ily and contains 17 transmembrane helices, which are
arranged in three clusters. sur possesses two intracellular nucleotide-binding folds (nbfs) as well as binding
sites for channel openers and for blockers of the sulfonylurea type (3). binding sites of channel openers and blockers have been localized to the cooh-terminal transmembrane domain complex of sur (4, 5, 30, 48), with
negative allosteric coupling between these sites (9, 41).
association of kir6.x and sur subunits is a prerequisite
for trafficking of the  xxxg1253xxx  octamer to the cell
membrane. both subunits contain several anterograde
and retrograde trafficking signal sequences (44, 51) that
determine cell surface expression.
the kir and the sur subunits of katp channels are
both encoded by two genes, kir6.1 and  xxxg1250xxx , and
 xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx . alternative splicing of the last exon
of  xxxg20xxx  gives rise to the isoforms sur2a and b (for
review, see refs. 2 and 3). channel diversity is created
by different combinations of kir6.x and surx subunits: the pancreatic  xxxg1253xxx  prototype ( xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx ) is blocked by the sulfonylurea  xxxd2215xxx 
with high potency (ic50 ⬍ 1 nm) and shows activation
by  xxxd1868xxx  (16, 22). the myocardial  xxxg1253xxx 
prototype ( xxxg1250xxx /sur2a) shows a lower affinity for
 xxxd2215xxx  (ic50 ⫽ 26 nm; ref. 38) and, in the
absence of mgadp, no activation by  xxxd1868xxx  (23, 32).
the vascular  xxxg1253xxx  prototype (kir6.1/sur2b)
shows a similar sensitivity for  xxxd2215xxx  (ic50 ⫽ 43
nm; ref. 37), although it is activated by  xxxd1868xxx  (25).
however, expression of these isoforms is not restricted
to these tissues. katp channels have also been described in brain (26, 27, 50), kidney (8), and coronary
endothelial cells (29). a mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx 
has also been postulated (24), but its molecular composition remains elusive (28, 43).
the  xxxg20xxx  gene contains 39 exons, and several different splice forms have been found in which the last
exon is altered (sur2a and sur2b; refs. 23, 25, and
49) or internal exons are skipped (12, 13, 39). the
regions of the nbfs form large cytosolic loops and have
attracted particular attention in the search for new
splice forms, because alternative splicing may change

nels but would not change membrane topology. changes
in the nbfs would be expected to modify the binding of
nucleotides and, by allosteric interactions, also the binding of k⫹ channel openers and sulfonylurea derivatives.
a  xxxg20xxx  splice form lacking exon 17 ( xxxg20xxx ⌬17) was
found by rt-pcr in several mouse tissues, including
heart, skeletal muscle, bladder, small intestine, and
prostate (13, 15). heterologous coexpression of this
splice form with  xxxg1250xxx  shows a small decrease in
atp-sensitivity (13). another  xxxg20xxx  splice form identified in cardiac tissue (12) lacks exon 14 but could not
be functionally expressed. in the case of  xxxg19xxx , a splice
form lacking exon 33 has been described that shows
unique electrophysiological properties (39). the lack of
exon 33 introduces a frame shift that leads to a deletion
of the second nucleotide binding domain (nbf2). a
second  xxxg19xxx  splice variant lacking exon 31 has not
been functionally characterized (6). here we describe
four novel splice forms of  xxxg19xxx . three of them lack
exon 17 ( xxxg19xxx ⌬17) and/or exon 19 ( xxxg19xxx ⌬17⌬19 or
 xxxg19xxx ⌬19), which are both located in the coding region
of the first nbf. the fourth splice form is a truncated
cooh-terminal  xxxg19xxx  fragment (sur1c). functional
analysis showed that only  xxxg19xxx  containing all the
exons (referred to as  xxxg19xxx  in the following text) and
 xxxg19xxx ⌬17 exhibit specific binding of  xxxd2215xxx  and
give rise to atp-sensitive channels when coexpressed
with  xxxg1250xxx  subunits.
materials and methods

rt-pcr of splice forms. rna from different guinea pig
tissues was prepared using a modified single-step method
(10). rna (1 ␮g) was reverse transcribed with superscript
reverse transcriptase (life technologies). as a positive control,  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx )
expression was tested by rt-pcr (29). rna from ventricular
cardiomyocytes and capillary endothelial cells was prepared
and reverse transcribed as described previously (34). the
purity of cell fractions was verified by rt-pcr experiments
by using the cell-specific markers troponin t and  xxxg674xxx  (34). two degenerated primers were used to amplify
both  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx  from rt samples, with the forward
primer located on exons 15 and 16 (5⬘-aggycagctracyatgatygtrgg-3⬘) and the reverse primer located on exon
21 (5⬘-atgtctggctgmagrgagcaggc-3⬘). the sur1c
fragment was amplified with primers located in the 5⬘-noncoding region of the sur1c cdna (see below) (forward:
5⬘-gaagggtggctatgatcactgatggg-3⬘) and in exon
31 (reverse: 5⬘-cacaggcaccgatgtactccattcg-3⬘).
pcr products of different sizes, depending on the splice form
(see results), were amplified by using amplitaq gold dna
polymerase (applied biosystems) for 35 cycles at 94°c for 1
min, 55°c for 30 s, and 73°c for 30 s (with an initial polymerase activation at 94°c for 6 min and a final elongation at
73°c for 5 min). finally, pcr products were visualized on a
4% nusieve agarose gel and directly sequenced. in addition,
pcr products were cloned into pbluescript sk⫹ vector (life
technologies) and sequenced to identify minor  xxxg19xxx  or
 xxxg20xxx  splice forms.
isolation of sur1c from a guinea pig cardiac cdna library. a cardiac ventricle cdna library was constructed,
ligated into the ␭triplex vector (clontech, palo alto, ca),
and screened with a cooh-terminal gpsur1 fragment as
described previously (29). total sequence information was
ajp-cell physiol • vol

obtained from the converted ptriplex. for 5⬘ and 3⬘ race
(rapid amplification of cdna ends), a marathon cdna was
synthesized from 5 ␮g of poly(a)⫹ rna as described previously (36).
construction of  xxxg19xxx  expression vectors. to construct a
 xxxg19xxx  expression vector of the different splice forms, an
apai/xhoi cassette was amplified from rat heart, kidney, and
brain cdna by using rat  xxxg19xxx  specific primers (forward:
5⬘-cgagaagaagtccgggacctct-3⬘, reverse: 5⬘-ctgtcctcttgtcatcccggag-3⬘). the pcr products were digested with apai and xhoi and cloned into pbluescript sk⫹
vector. rat  xxxg19xxx ⌬17 and  xxxg19xxx ⌬19 splice forms were identified by dna sequencing. finally, the ⌬17 and ⌬19 cassettes
were subcloned into rat  xxxg19xxx /pbf1 (kindly provided by dr.
b. fakler, tübingen, germany). for heterologous expression
in mammalian cells, the ratsur1 splice forms were subcloned into pcdna3.1 (invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany) or
pegfp-c1 (nh2-terminal fusion of the enhanced green fluorescent protein; clontech) vectors. for expression of the
sur1c splice form, the guinea pig clone was used.
cell culture and transfections. human embryonic kidney
(hek)-293 cells were cultured as described previously (19,
20) in minimum essential medium containing glutamine,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 ␮g/ml
 xxxd2193xxx . cos-7 cells were grown in dmem (life technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10
␮g/ml streptomycin-ampicillin mixture (biochrom, berlin,
germany). for binding studies and electrophysiological measurements, cells were transfected with mammalian expression vector pcdna3.1 (invitrogen) containing the coding sequence of rat  xxxg19xxx  (rsur1; genbank accession no. x97279;
ref. 1), the different splice forms of  xxxg19xxx  mentioned above,
or pcdna3.1 vector alone with lipofectamine and optimem
(invitrogen) (19). for electrophysiological studies,  xxxg19xxx 
splice forms were cotransfected transiently with  xxxg1250xxx  (genbank accession no. d50581; ref. 22) at a molar plasmid ratio
of 1:1. here, pegfp-c1 vector (clontech), encoding for green
fluorescent protein, was added for easier identification of
transfected cells. two to four days after transfection, cells
were used for binding studies and electrophysiological experiments. cell lines stably transfected with  xxxg19xxx  wild-type or
 xxxg19xxx  splice forms were isolated in the presence of 700 ␮g
 xxxd2191xxx /ml in the first 3 wk and 300 ␮g  xxxd2191xxx /ml medium; thereafter, 1 wk before experiments, the antibiotic was
withdrawn.
for confocal microscopy, rsur1 splice forms and guinea
pig kir6.1 cdnas (genbank accession nos. af183918 and
af183919; ref. 29) were fused to the egfp gene by cloning
into the expression vector pegfp-c1 or -n1 (clontech). subcellular localization vectors were used to label mitochondria
(mitogfp: targeting sequence of the ␤-subunit of f1-atpase
from neurospora crassa was ligated into the pegfp-n1
vector) and the endoplasmic reticulum (peyfp-er, clontech). hek-293 or cos-7 cells were transiently transfected
by using lipofectamine 2000 as transfection reagent and
incubated for 24 h at 37°c.
confocal microscopy. confocal images were produced using a fv300 confocal laser scanning microscope (olympus,
hamburg, germany). images of 600 ⫻ 800 pixels were obtained via a ⫻60 oil-immersion objective lens (numerical
aperture 1.4). laser intensity was set at 6%, and the pinhole
was optimized for the ⫻60 objective. cos-7 cells were grown
on coverslips, and mitochondria were labeled by incubation
with 50 nm mitotracker red (molecular probes, leiden, the
netherlands) for 7–8 min at ⬃30°c. mitotracker red was
excited with the 568-nm line of a kr-ar ion laser, and red
fluorescence was detected at ⬎585 nm. we avoided repeat-

edly scanning mitotracker red-labeled cells because we
found that repeated excitation induced a change in mitochondrial morphology, probably secondary to the phototoxic effects of this indicator as previously described (31). simultaneous to mitotracker red excitation, egfp was excited at
488 nm, and green fluorescence was detected at 510–540 nm.
areas of overlap between the red and green signals were seen
as yellow.
equilibrium-binding experiments. membranes were prepared from hek-293 cells at 80% confluence (16 million
cells/dish) (19). cells were easily detached by repeated rinsing with medium in the absence of trypsin and centrifuged at
37°c for 6 min at 500 g. the pelleted cells were lysed by
addition of 5 ml/dish of ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing
10 mm hepes and 1 mm egta (ph 7.4), and the lysate was
centrifuged (100,000 g) for 60 min at 4°c. the resulting
membrane pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 5
mm hepes, 5 mm kcl, and 139 mm nacl (ph 7.4, 4°c) at
a protein concentration of 0.7 mg/ml and frozen at ⫺80°c. in
the binding assay, membranes (final protein concentration
0.03–0.4 mg/ml) were added to the incubation buffer (139
mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 5 mm hepes, and 2.2 mm mgcl2)
supplemented with the radioligand [1–6 nm [3h] xxxd2215xxx  (gbc)], the competitor of interest, and either 2.2 mm
mgcl2 ⫹ 1 mm na2 atp (for binding experiments in the
presence of mgatp) or 0 mm mgcl2 ⫹ 0 mm na2 atp ⫹ 1
mm edta (for experiments in the absence of mgatp). after
15 min of incubation at 37°c, the reaction was stopped by
diluting 0.3-ml aliquots in triplicate into 8 ml of ice-cold
quench solution [50 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane,
154 mm nacl, ph 7.4] and rapid filtration under vacuum
over whatman gf/b filters. filters were washed twice with 8
ml of ice-cold quench solution and counted for 3h in the
presence of 6 ml of scintillant (ultima gold; packard, meriden, ct). nonspecific binding of [3h]gbc (bns) was determined in the presence of 1 ␮m gbc and was about 5–10% of
total binding.
patch-clamp experiments. whole cell or inside-out patchclamp recordings (21) were carried out in hek-293 cells
cotransfected with  xxxg1253xxx  subunits and green fluorescent protein (gfp). patch pipettes were drawn from borosilicate glass capillaries (gc 150t; harvard apparatus, edenbridge, uk) and heat polished using a horizontal microelectrode
puller (zeitz, augsburg, germany). for inside-out patches, bath
and pipette were filled with a high-k⫹ ringer solution containing (in mm) 142 kcl, 2.8 nacl, 1 mgcl2, 1 cacl2, 11 d(⫹)glucose, and 10 hepes, titrated to ph 7.4 with naoh at 22°c.
after being filled with buffer, pipettes had a resistance of 1–1.5
m⍀. after the patch was excised, the pipette was moved in front
of a superfusion cannula filled with high- k⫹ egta ringer
solution containing 143 mm kcl, 0.85 mm mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2,
5 mm egta, 11 mm d(⫹)-glucose, and 10 mm hepes (ph 7.2,
22°c). atp was added to the solution, keeping free mg2⫹
constant (0.7 mm), and kcl was reduced to maintain osmolarity. the solution with low free mg2⫹ contained 142 mm kcl, 0.5
mm cacl2, 0.5 mm mgcl2, 5 mm edta, 10 mm hepes, and
11 mm d-glucose (ph 7.2, 22°c). the free ca2⫹ and mg2⫹
concentrations were calculated to be 5.4 and 270 nm, respectively (19). atp was added in appropriate amounts and had
only minor effects on free ca2⫹ or mg2⫹. after addition of 1 mm
atp, the concentration of mgatp was 2.3 ␮m. excised patches
were clamped at a transmembrane potential of ⫺50 mv.
experiments using the whole cell configuration were performed as described in ref. 37. the bath solution contained
(in mm) 142 nacl, 2.8 kcl, 1 mgcl2, 1 cacl2, 11 d(⫹)glucose, and 10 hepes, titrated to ph 7.4 with naoh at
37°c. patch pipettes were filled with (in mm) 132 k-glutaajp-cell physiol • vol

mate, 10 nacl, 2 mgcl2, 10 hepes, 1 egta, 1 li2gdp, and
0.3 na2atp, titrated to ph 7.2 with naoh. resistance after
filling was 3–5 m⍀. cells were clamped at ⫺60 mv. data
were recorded with an epc9 amplifier (heka, lambrecht,
germany) using pulse software. signals were filtered at 200
hz with the four-pole bessel filter of the epc9 amplifier and
sampled at 1 khz.
data analysis and statistics. inhibition curves from radioligand binding and patch-clamp experiments were analyzed
according to the logistic equation
y ⫽ 100 ⫺ a(1 ⫹ 10 nhⴱ(px⫺pic50))⫺1

(1)

where a denotes the relative extent of inhibition at saturation (a ⫽ 100 for complete inhibition of the current by atp),
nh is the hill coefficient, and pic50 is the midpoint of the
curve with pic50 ⫽ ⫺log ic50; x is the concentration of the
compound under study with px ⫽ ⫺log x. in binding experiments, two-component analysis with nh ⫽ 1 was sometimes
required. the dependence of the ic50 value on the concentration of the radioligand, l, was calculated according to the
equation (11)
ic 50 ⫽ k i (1 ⫹ l/kd)

(2)

where ki is the inhibition constant and kd is the equilibrium
dissociation constant of the radioligand.
fits of the equations to the experimental data were performed according to the method of least squares using the
programs figp (biosoft, cambridge, uk) or sigmaplot
(spss, chicago, il). assuming that amplitudes and pk values are normally distributed, significance of difference between the parameters was calculated by the two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test or by one-way analysis of variance by
using the program graphpad prism, version 3.0 (graphpad
software, san diego, ca). in the text, the ic50 or k values
are followed by the 95% confidence interval in parentheses.
materials. [3h]gbc [specific activity 1.85 tbq (50 ci)/
mmol] was purchased from perkin elmer life science products (bad homburg, germany). the reagents and media used
for cell culture and transfection were from invitrogen.
na2atp and li2gdp were obtained from roche molecular
biochemicals (mannheim, germany) and  xxxd2215xxx  from
sigma (deisenhofen, germany). the following drugs were
kind gifts of the pharmaceutical companies indicated:  xxxd1868xxx  (essex pharma, munich, germany), meglitinide (aventis,
frankfurt, germany), and l-pinacidil (leo pharmaceuticals,
ballerup, denmark).  xxxg1253xxx  modulators were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx /ethanol [50/50 (vol/vol)] and further diluted with the same solvent or with incubation buffer
(final solvent concentration ⬍ 0.3%).
results

identification of guinea pig  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx  splice
forms. to investigate alternative splicing of the short
exons of the first nbf of guinea pig sur subunits, we
designed primers for amplification of exons 16–20
( xxxg19xxx ) or 16–19 ( xxxg20xxx ) from both gpsur1 and gpsur2 in one pcr reaction (fig. 1). after the pcr
products were separated on a 4% nusieve agarose gel,
bands of 323, ⬇290, 252, 224, and 191 bp were identified in several tissues and cell fractions (fig. 2). direct
sequencing or cloning of pcr products revealed that
these bands correspond to the following gpsur splice
forms: gpsur1 (323 bp); gpsur2 (291 bp); and gpsur1⌬17 (286 bp) as a component of the ⬇290-bp pcr

second pcr band shown in fig. 2a revealed only the
sequence of gpsur2. however, cloning and sequencing

of isolated clones showed that a minor portion of this

figure 1a shows an alignment of the partial cdna
and amino acid sequences of gpsur1 (genbank accession no. ay050167) and gpsur2 (genbank accession
no. ay050168). sequence comparison showed that the
amplified gpsur1 sequence is highly homologous
(⬎90% identity on the amino acid level) to its human,
rat, or hamster orthologs (fig. 1b). the short exon 17 is
less conserved (⬇60% identity), with two additional
amino acids in the guinea pig sequence compared with
human. the gpsur2 sequence showed an even higher
homology to orthologous sequences (⬎97% identity).
tissue distribution of sur splice forms. figure 2a
shows the rt-pcr analysis of several guinea pig tissues. the different gpsur splice forms were detected
in significant amounts in all tissues tested (fig. 2a),
except for gpsur1⌬17⌬19, which was found only in
the cardiomyocyte fraction (see sur expression in
heart cell fraction). the relative amounts of the pcr
products varied from organ to organ. gpsur1 was
detected in all tissues tested, although the band observed in heart was very faint. gpsur1⌬19 was detected at low levels in brain, lung, heart, and pancreas
and at even lower amounts in other tissues. the detection of gpsur1⌬17 was difficult because the size of the
pcr product was the same as for gpsur2. however,
from sequencing of cloned pcr products, it became
clear that the number of gpsur1⌬17 clones were always ⬍10% of the total clones tested, indicating that
this isoform is a minor splice variant. gpsur2 was
particularly abundant in brain, heart, kidney, and
liver. gpsur2⌬17 was found at high rna levels in
stomach and, in agreement with previous work (13), in
skeletal muscle. note that exon 18 of  xxxg20xxx  is equivalent to exon 19 of  xxxg19xxx  (fig. 1b); thus  xxxg20xxx ⌬18 would
correspond to  xxxg19xxx ⌬19. however, we have not detected a gpsur2 splice form without exon 18.
sur expression in heart cell fraction. cell-specific
rt-pcr analysis was carried out with isolated cardiomyocytes and with coronary capillaries, which consist
only of microvascular endothelial cells. in both cell
types, gpsur2 was the dominant pcr signal (fig. 2b).
gpsur2⌬17 was also expressed, especially in endothelial cells. in accordance with the analysis of whole
heart fraction, low amounts of gpsur1, gpsur1⌬19,
and gpsur1⌬17 were found in cardiomyocytes. the
expression of the splice form lacking both exons, gpsur1⌬17⌬19, appeared to be restricted to cardiomyocytes because it was not observed in other tissues or in
coronary capillaries. in endothelial cells, only gpsur1
was detected but not (or only very weakly) the other
gpsur1 splice forms.
identification of a short splice variant of  xxxg19xxx . to
isolate  xxxg19xxx  from a guinea pig heart, we constructed a
cdna library and screened with a cooh-terminal
guinea pig-specific  xxxg19xxx  probe (29). several positive
clones were identified and isolated. after the ␭triplex
dna was converted from an isolated clone to ptriplex,
sequencing revealed a gpsur1 cdna 1,663 bp in
length (genbank accession no. af183921). the 5⬘ noncoding region (nucleotides 1–556) of this clone showed
an as yet unknown sequence from bp 1 to 205 and

continued with the known sequence of gpsur1 starting at exon 28. the putative coding region of the cdna
(557–1552 bp) represents exons 31 (with a putative
start-codon) to 39 of gpsur1 and encodes a truncated
gpsur1 protein of 332 amino acids, which we named
gpsur1c. the deduced amino acid sequence contains
only the last two putative transmembrane regions and
the cooh-terminal domain of gpsur1.
to exclude the possibility that the gpsur1c clone is
an artifact of cdna synthesis, we confirmed the expression of this short gpsur1 transcript with 5⬘ race
experiments. figure 2c shows the rt-pcr analysis of
several guinea pig tissues. gpsur1c was found to be
highly expressed in the atria and ventricles of guinea
pig heart. at a lower expression level, gpsur1c was
detected in brain, lung, liver, kidney, and skeletal
muscle. cell-specific expression of gpsur1c in the
heart was studied by using the multicell rt-pcr
method described previously (34). gpsur1c was found
to be expressed exclusively in ventricular cardiomyocytes and not in endothelial cells from coronary capillaries, as illustrated in fig. 2d.
 xxxg19xxx  splice forms from rat. because we have not
cloned the entire  xxxg19xxx  from guinea pig, we reconstituted the splice forms lacking exons 17 and 19 with the
rat  xxxg19xxx  cdna (see materials and methods). by amplifying a 690-bp fragment (apai-xhoi cassette) from
different rat tissues, we were able to detect the
rsur1⌬17 and rsur1⌬19 splice forms in this species
as well (data not shown). however, we have not performed a detailed expression analysis in rat tissues.
although there are significant sequence differences
between guinea pig and rat exons 17–18, including
several amino acid substitutions and one insertion in
exon 17 (see fig. 1b), the overall sequence identity (21
of 27 residues) and the conservation of alternative
splicing are consistent with conserved functional properties. for further functional analysis, these rsur1
splice forms (except for gpsur1c) were used.
the novel  xxxg19xxx  splice forms are not part of the
mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx . in recent years much work
has been done to elucidate the molecular nature of the
mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx . to investigate the possibility that the novel  xxxg19xxx  splice forms may be targeted
to the mitochondria, we constructed several egfp-fusion proteins of rsur1, rsur1⌬19, rsur1⌬17, and
gpsur1c as well as kir6.1. figure 3 shows cos-7 cells
labeled with the red fluorescent dye mitotracker red (a)
or transfected only with the subcellular localization
markers mitogfp but not with sur or kir6.1 subunits
(b). mitotracker red and mitogfp were used as positive
controls for targeting the mitochondria. it can be seen
that the fluorescence of these two markers overlapped
(fig. 3c), thus providing a reliable picture of the subcellular localization of mitochondria (fig. 3, a–c). to determine the morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum (er),
a yfp-tagged er-marker was used (fig. 3, d and e).
figure 4 shows the fluorescence of cos-7 cells transfected with egfp-tagged rsur1, rsur1⌬19, and
rsur1⌬17. no overlap with mitotracker red fluorescence was seen for these egfp-tagged splice forms. re-

cently, it has been suggested that the kir6.1 subunit may
be part of the mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx  (46). coexpression of the  xxxg19xxx  splice forms with nh2- or coohterminally egfp-tagged kir6.1, however, never resulted
in a mitochondrial targeting of the kir6.1 subunits, as
illustrated in fig. 5. figure 5 shows coexpression of
kir6.1-egfp with rsur1⌬17 (a–c) and coexpression of
kir6.1-egfp with rsur1⌬19 (d–f). similar results
were obtained for rsur1 and gpsur1c (not shown). in
summary, our results suggest that  xxxg19xxx  splice forms
and kir6.1 are not part of the mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx . the sometimes diffusely labeled cytosol may indicate
that egfp-labeled  xxxg1253xxx  subunits may not only
be retained in the er but may also be found in other
vesicular structures yet to be characterized.
binding of [3h]gbc to the different  xxxg19xxx  splice
forms. after transfection of hek-293 cells with different  xxxg19xxx  splice forms, the binding of  xxxd2215xxx  to
membrane preparations of these cells was investigated. first, [3h]gbc binding was assayed using high
concentrations of radioligand (5 nm) and protein (0.2–
0.4 mg/ml). these conditions were chosen to allow us to
ajp-cell physiol • vol

differentiate between low-affinity specific and endogenous [3h]gbc binding to control cells transfected with
pcdna3.1 vector alone. experiments were performed
with 0 mm mg2⫹ and 1 mm edta to avoid inhibition
of specific [3h]gbc binding by mgatp (40).
we found no significant difference between membranes from cells transfected with pcdna3.1 vector
alone (control) and with rsur1⌬19, rsur1⌬17⌬19,
and gpsur1c. there was no difference in total binding between the different preparations (at 5 nm
[3h]gbc ⬃150 fmol/mg protein). addition of 100 nm
unlabeled gbc reduced total [3h]gbc binding by
⬃5%; reduction after addition of 10 ␮m gbc was
25–30%. therefore, the binding measured for these
splice forms was due to unspecific endogenous gbcbinding to the hek-293 cells (20, 37). on the other
hand, specific binding of [3h]gbc to rsur1 and
rsur1⌬17 was detected (radioligand concentration 1
nm). in the absence of mgatp, total binding was
1.3–1.4 pmol/mg protein, and addition of 1 ␮m unlabeled gbc reduced binding by 1.1–1.3 pmol/mg
protein for rsur1 and rsur1⌬17. because only

in homologous competition experiments, [3h]gbc
binding to rsur1 was displaced by unlabeled gbc
with kd values of 0.2 nm in the absence and 1.6 nm in
the presence of 1 mm mgatp (fig. 6a, table 1). the
results obtained with rsur1 and rsur1⌬17 were not
significantly different, with kd values of 0.2 nm in the
absence of mgatp and 2.0 nm in the presence of 1 mm
mgatp. hill coefficients were close to 1 for all curves,
indicating the presence of a single class of  xxxd2215xxx  binding sites in each splice form. specific binding of [3h]gbc was inhibited to maximally 30% by
mgatp in a concentration-dependent manner, giving
very similar curves for both splice forms (fig. 6b). both
inhibition curves displayed two components with
nearly the same amplitudes and ic50 values of ⬃3 and
200 ␮m (see fig. 6b for precise parameters). control
experiments in the presence of 1 mm edta or 1 mm
edta ⫹ 1 mm atp showed that neither free magnesium nor free atp affected (specific or nonspecific)
[3h]gbc binding (data not shown).
inhibition of specific [3h]gbc binding by another
 xxxg1253xxx  blocker, the  xxxd306xxx  derivative meglitinide, which binds to a subpocket of the  xxxd2215xxx  binding site (4), was also investigated. similar
to the homologous competition by  xxxd2215xxx , displacement of specific [3h]gbc binding by meglitinide
(fig. 7a) occurred in a monophasic manner for both
splice forms (hill coefficients very close to 1 in all
cases). again, curves obtained in the absence of
mgatp were shifted to the left compared with the
curves obtained in the presence of 1 mm mgatp.
results obtained in the absence and in the presence of
mgatp were significantly different for both rsur1
(p ⬍ 0.001) and rsur1⌬17 (p ⬍ 0.0001). on the other
hand, there was no significant difference in the parameters obtained for rsur1 and rsur1⌬17 (table 1).
to test the binding properties of selected openers,
inhibition of [3h]gbc binding by unlabeled l-pinacidil
and  xxxd1868xxx  was analyzed at 0 mm mg2⫹ and 1 mm
edta and at 2.2 mm mg2⫹ and 1 mm atp. displacement of [3h]gbc by both openers was found only in the
presence of mgatp (fig. 7b), as has been shown previously (33, 41). the curves obtained for both openers
were very similar for rsur1 and rsur1⌬17.
electrophysiological characterization. the ability of
the splice forms to produce functional plasmalemmal
k⫹ channels was tested in the whole cell configuration
of the patch-clamp technique. whereas 4 of 4 green
fluorescent cells examined after transfection with
 xxxg1250xxx  and rsur1 developed a prominent inward current, no such currents were detected in 23 cells from
two transfections with  xxxg1250xxx /gpsur1c or in 18 cells
transfected with  xxxg1250xxx /rsur1⌬19.
chutkow et al. (13) described differences in the potency of atp block between channels containing  xxxg20xxx 
or  xxxg20xxx ⌬17. therefore, the atp sensitivities of
 xxxg1250xxx /rsur1 and  xxxg1250xxx /rsur1⌬17 channels were
compared in the inside-out patch-clamp configuration
(fig. 8). as shown in fig. 8a, rundown and refreshment of the channel in the presence of 0.7 mm free

mg2⫹ led to some minor differences in atp-block efficiency during repetitive application and washout of
atp. therefore, the mean value of two successive runs
was determined for each cell, and cells transfected with
rsur1 and with rsur1⌬17 were subjected to exactly
the same protocol. figure 8b shows that there was no
difference in atp sensitivity between the two splice
forms at low (270 nm) and physiological (0.7 mm) free

discussion

alternative splicing of sur is a functionally important mechanism for creating  xxxg1253xxx  diversity.
most prominently, the differential usage of the two last
 xxxg20xxx  exons (38a and 38b) gives rise to channels with
very different pharmacological properties (23, 25). the
 xxxg19xxx  genes consist of 39 exons, only some of which can
be spliced out without generating a frame shift. several “spliceable” sur exons are found within the coding region of the first nbf. previous reports demonstrated skipping of exons 14, 17, and 18 of  xxxg20xxx  (2, 13,
15). in the present work we describe three novel splice
ajp-cell physiol • vol

variants of  xxxg19xxx  in which the reading frames are
preserved:  xxxg19xxx ⌬17, in which 36 bp are spliced out;
 xxxg19xxx ⌬19, in which 99 bp are spliced out; and
sur⌬17⌬19.
the  xxxg19xxx  splice forms lacking exons 17 and/or 19
were detected in various guinea pig and rat tissues,
although in smaller amounts than  xxxg19xxx  containing
both exons 17 and 19. different cell-specific expression
patterns were found in the heart, indicating different
regulation of alternative splicing in cardiac muscle
cells and microvascular endothelial cells. the other
novel splice variant, gpsur1c, consisting only of exons
31–39 of  xxxg19xxx , was found to be strongly expressed in
cardiac atria and ventricles. its expression appears to
be restricted to cardiomyocytes because no pcr signal
was obtained in the capillary fractions. this short
splice variant has a predicted molecular mass of 36
kda.
because recent biochemical work has demonstrated
that the molecular mass of the mitochondrial sur is
much smaller (29 kda, ref. 47, or 63 kda, ref. 18) than
that of  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx  (177 and 174 kda), we consid-

ered gpsur1c as a potential candidate for the mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx . however, the restricted expression pattern of gpsur1c and the subcellular
localization of the egfp-tagged  xxxg1253xxx  subunits
make it very unlikely that gpsur1c represents  xxxg220xxx  of the mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx . thus the functional role of this truncated splice form remains unclear. our experiments with egfp-tagged proteins
suggest that none of the other novel  xxxg19xxx  splice forms,
ajp-cell physiol • vol

c595

rsur1⌬17 and rsur1⌬19, is targeted to the mitochondria, either alone or in combination with kir6.1. by
using immunogold labeling, suzuki et al. (46) speculated that kir6.1 may be the kir6 subunit of the mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx . in agreement with other work
(43), our results using nh2- or cooh-terminally
tagged kir6.1 showed no mitochondrial targeting.
the radioligand studies showed no specific [3h]gbc
binding to rsur1⌬19, rsur1⌬17⌬19, or gpsur1c. on
the other hand, specific binding of [3h]gbc was detected with rsur1 and rsur1⌬17. both splice forms
also showed great similarity in the other pharmacological properties tested: specific binding of [3h]gbc was
inhibited by mgatp in a concentration-dependent
manner, consistent with the shift in [3h]gbc/ xxxd2215xxx  and [3h]gbc/meglitinide inhibition curves determined in the absence and the presence of mgatp.
heterologous displacement of [3h]gbc binding by
l-pinacidil and  xxxd1868xxx  was only detectable in the
presence of mgatp, because high-affinity binding of
these openers requires mgatp (19, 33, 35, 41, 42). the
amplitudes of [3h]gbc displacement by l-pinacidil
(⬃80%) and  xxxd1868xxx  (⬃50%) differed from the results
of schwanstecher et al. (42) who found 100% displacement in both cases. to explain this discrepancy, it has
to be taken into account that experimental conditions
(expression system, incubation time, and temperature)
in these studies were different.
the characteristics of atp inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx /
rsur1 reported in the present study are in excellent
agreement with a previous report (22). surprisingly,
we observed no difference in atp block of  xxxg1250xxx /
rsur1 and  xxxg1250xxx /rsur1⌬17 in either the presence or
absence of free mg2⫹. for the ⌬17 splice variants of
sur2a and sur2b, however, chutkow et al. (13)
measured a reduced atp sensitivity for channels containing  xxxg1250xxx  and sur2x⌬17. therefore,  xxxg19xxx /
 xxxg19xxx ⌬17 clearly differ from  xxxg20xxx / xxxg20xxx ⌬17 in this
respect. because of the prominent differences of  xxxg19xxx 
and  xxxg20xxx  in exon 17 itself and the neighboring region
(fig. 1), a divergent behavior of the two proteins is
plausible.
our electrophysiological characterization of atp and
mg2⫹ sensitivity and our radioligand binding studies
suggest that the lack of exon 17 does not affect functional expression of rsur1 in the plasma membrane
and its pharmacological properties. in contrast, exon
19 of rsur1 appears to be essential for  xxxd2215xxx 
binding and functional channel expression because no
specific  xxxd2215xxx  binding was detected in the
splice variants rsur1⌬19 and rsur1⌬17⌬19 and no
katp currents were observed upon coexpression of
 xxxg1250xxx  with rsur1⌬17⌬19. previous studies (4, 30)
have shown that the region between transmembrane
helix 14 and cl8 (the cytosolic loop linking helices 15
and 16) contribute to  xxxd2215xxx  binding by interacting with the cyclohexyl ring of the  xxxd2215xxx 
molecule (4); in addition, cl3 (the cytosolic loop linking transmembrane helices 5 and 6) is important for
high-affinity  xxxd2215xxx  binding to  xxxg19xxx  (30). on
the basis of the existing data, it cannot be decided

alternative splicing of  xxxg19xxx 

whether the region encoded by exon 19 represents an
essential part of the  xxxd2215xxx  binding site (e.g.,
for the benzamido or the sulfonylurea part of the molecule) or whether the absence of exon 19 affects  xxxd2215xxx  binding indirectly, for example, by introducing a conformational change in the  xxxg19xxx  molecule.
in conclusion, we have found three splice variants of
 xxxg19xxx  originating from alternative splicing of the region encoding nbf1 and a short splice variant containing only exons 31–39. the splice variants  xxxg19xxx ⌬17
and  xxxg19xxx ⌬19 were expressed in all tissues tested,
albeit to a lesser amount than the  xxxg19xxx  containing all
exons. only one of these splice forms,  xxxg19xxx ⌬17,
showed  xxxd2215xxx  binding and functional expression in combination with the pore-forming subunit
 xxxg1250xxx . the short splice variant was found to be
strongly expressed in cardiac muscle cells and displayed no high affinity for  xxxd2215xxx . because none
of the four novel splice variants was targeted to the
mitochondria, they do not appear to participate in the
formation of mitochondrial katp channels.
