antiemetic specificity of dopamine antagonists
c. j. e. niemegeers
department of pharmacology,janssen pharmaceutica research laboratories, b-2340 beerse, belgium
abstract. twelve antagonists of apomorphine-induced emesis
in dogs were studied in different tests to evaluate their
antiemetic specificity. ten of these antagonists were neuroleptics:  xxxd312xxx , clebopride,  xxxd374xxx ,  xxxd3018xxx , haloperidol, chlorpromazine,  xxxd3349xxx , metoclopramide,  xxxd1945xxx , and  xxxd2956xxx  blocked conditioned
responding in dogs and apomorphine-induced stereotyped
behavior in rats. the use of these compounds as anti-emetics
entails a risk of neurological side effects. metopimazine and
 xxxd1927xxx  were devoid of neuroleptic activity. metopimazine, however, showed potent c~-adrenergic blocking
activity, showed histamine h1 antagonism, and induced
palpebral ptosis. therapeutic doses of metopimazine are,
therefore, likely to produce sedation and side-effects related
to autonomic blockade,  xxxd1927xxx  showed potent antiemetic activity and, up to high doses, no other central or
peripheral effects. therefore,  xxxd1927xxx  is the only specific
antiemetic known.
key words: neuroleptics - antiemetics - antiemetic specificity - dogs - rats

all neuroleptics are dopamine (da) receptor blocking agents
(niemegeers and janssen 1979). the characteristic effects that
they have in common are thought to result from their
interaction with da receptors. this applies to their antiemetic activity, antipsychotic activity, and neurological side
effect liability.
pharmacologically, the antiemetic activity of neuroleptics
has generally been assessed in the dog using apomorphine
(ap)-induced emesis. central da receptor blocking activity
has typically been studied in the rat. consequently any
apparent dissociation between antiemetic and neuroleptic
activity thus obtained may at least in part be due to species
differences rather than to antiemetic specifity.
several well-known neuroleptics have been claimed to be
relatively more specific antiemetics than others and are
clinically used as such, whereas other, more recently introduced antiemetics have been claimed to be virtually devoid
of central da receptor blocking activity.
the purpose of this paper was to establish the antiemetic
specificity of a series of compounds by studying both the
antiemetic (anti-ap) and the neuroleptic (shuttle box test)
activity in the dog. to further complete the pharmacological
profile (side effect liability unrelated to da receptor blockade) of these compounds, their activity in different tests on
rats was evaluated and compared.

materials and methods

beagle dogs (8 - 16 kg) and albino wistar rats (200 - 250 g) of
both sexes, born and raised in the animal facility of janssen
pharmaceutica, were used.
test procedures in beagle dogs. for ap-induced emesis, the
dogs received sc injection of 0.31 mg/kg ap hc1 (four-times
the ed 95). at different time intervals before the ap challenge
(15 rain, 30 rain, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 h), the dogs were pretreated
with different doses (sc, orally) of the compounds under
study. complete protection from emesis for i h after ap was
adopted as the criterion for antiemetic activity (niemegeers et
al. 1980). at each time interval eds0 were calculated and
time-effect curves were fitted to these data points. this
procedure was used to determine onset and duration of
action, time of peak effect, and oral absorption of the
compounds.
inhibition of conditioned avoidance behaviour in the
shuttle box was measured 1, 4, and 24h after sc administration of the compounds using 12 well-trained dogs. each
session consisted of ten consecutive trials of 20 s each. loss of
avoidance in more than one of ten trials was considered to be
a drug-induced effect (niemegeers and janssen 1960; janssen
et at. 1968).
test procedures in wistar rats. the 'atn test', in which ap
(1.25 mg/kg iv, t = time = 0), tryptamine (40.0 mg/kg iv,
t = +60min), and norepinephrine (1.25mg/kg iv,
t = +90rain) were injected sequentially, was used. the
experimental drugs were given 30 rain ( xxxd2956xxx , 4 h) before
ap injection. the atn test measured antagonism of apinduced stereotypy, tryptamine-induced bilateral clonic seizures of the forepaws, and norepinephrine-induced lethality
(niemegeers et at. 1977).
the compound 48/80-induced lethality test, which measures the antagonism of the lethal effect of 0.5 mg/kg iv
compound 48/80 (niemegeers et at. 1978), was used. the
experimental drugs were given 1 h ( xxxd2956xxx , 4h) before
compound 48/80.
for the catalepsy and palpebral ptosis test, hourly
intervals over a period of 8 h, catalepsy (maintenance of an
abnormal upright position, forepaws on top of the cage wall)
was simultaneously scored by two independent observers
using the following scoring system: no catalepsy (13);slight or
doubtful (1); of average intensity (2); very pronounced (3).
palpebral ptosis after manipulation was assessed in the same
rats at the same time intervals using a score of 4 for wide-open
eyes, 2 for half-open eyes, and 0 when eyes were completely

211
closed, scores 1 and 3 being intermediate values (janssen et al.
1965).

statistical evaluation. edso values and 9 5 ~ confidence
limits (mg/kg) were calculated by probit analysis (finney
1962) according to all-or-none criteria. these criteria were
adopted following analysis of the results obtained in a large
control population and indicate behavior which occurred in
less than 5 ~ of these animals.
drugs.  xxxd312xxx 
(pfizer, usa),  xxxd374xxx 
(schfirholz, w.-germany), clebopride (almirall, spain),
chlorpromazine hc1 (rh6ne-poulenc, france),  xxxd1927xxx 
(janssen, belgium),  xxxd1945xxx  (janssen), haloperidol
(janssen), metoclopramide 2 hci h20 (delagrange, france),
metopimazine (rh6ne-poulenc),  xxxd2956xxx  (janssen),  xxxd3018xxx  maleate (smith kline and french, usa), and
 xxxd3349xxx  (sandoz, switzerland) were used.

results

antiemetic potency in the dog. the 12 compounds studied
were all effective antiemetics but there were large differences
in potency (table 1).  xxxd1945xxx ,  xxxd1927xxx , and clebopride sc were active at edso doses below 0.01mg/kg,
whereas the active doses of  xxxd3018xxx , chlorpromazine
and  xxxd312xxx  were 0.34-0.69mg/kg. in fact,  xxxd312xxx  was 575-times less potent than  xxxd1945xxx .
marked differences among these compounds were also
apparent in terms of their onset, time of peak effect, and
duration of action (table 1).  xxxd1927xxx , haloperidol, and
metoclopramide had a fast (5 rain) and metopimazine had a
slow (30 min) onset. peak effects also varied from 15 rain for
haloperidol and metoclopramide to 150min for metopimazine and 4h for  xxxd2956xxx . the duration of action of
 xxxd1927xxx  was 7 h, and that of metopimazine was 9 h.
metoclopramide was the compound with the shortest duration of action (2 h), whereas  xxxd2956xxx  had duration of action
of 24 h. all compounds studied here were also found to be
effective antiemetics when given orally (table 1). the oral

absorption factor varied from 0.86 for  xxxd312xxx  [0.86 is
the ratio of the sc edso (0.69) to the oral eds0 (0.80)] to 0.12
for chlorpromazine (0.54:4.38). however, eds0 of
4.38mg/kg is not necessarily representative of the oral
antiemetic activity of the compound. all other compounds
were relatively well absorbed with an oral activity of threequarters to one-fifth of their sc activity.

inhibition of conditioned avoidance in the dog. all 12
compounds were also effective inhibitors of conditioned
reactions (table 1). in the shuttle box test,  xxxd1945xxx ,
clebopride, and haloperidol were active at doses below
0.10 mg/kg.  xxxd1927xxx , metopimazine,  xxxd312xxx ,
and chlorpromazine required doses of more than 2 mg/kg. it
is, therefore, of great interest to compare the activity of the
different compounds in the ap antagonism and the shuttle
box test. nine of the 12 compounds exhibited central da
receptor blocking (neuroleptic) activity at doses 4.01-6.58times the antiemetic dose;  xxxd312xxx  (4.01), clebopride
(4.83),  xxxd374xxx  (4.84),  xxxd3018xxx  (5.29), haloperidol (5.53), chlorpromazine (5.87),  xxxd3349xxx  (5.94),
metoclopramide (6.25), and  xxxd1945xxx  (6.58). for  xxxd2956xxx ,
central activity was found to be 18.2-times the antiemetic
dose. for metopimazine and  xxxd1927xxx , the central activity appeared at doses 197- and 318-times the antiemetic
dose.
effects in the rat. all compounds that blocked conditioned
behavior in the shuttle box test in dogs at relatively low doses,
i. e., all compounds except metopimazine (antiemetic specificity ratio 197) and  xxxd1927xxx  (antiemetic specificity ratio
318) were also found to be potent inhibitors of ap-induced
stereotypy in rats (table 2). tryptamine antagonism (table 2)
occurred at higher doses for all compounds, except metopimazine (>20.0mg/kg) and  xxxd1927xxx  (>10.0mg/kg),
which were devoid of such activity.
norepinephrine antagonism (table 2) was very pronounced with metopimazine (edso 0.15 mg/kg) and also occurred
at relatively low doses of chlorpromazine,  xxxd1945xxx , and
 xxxd3349xxx . potent compound 48/80 antagonism was
shown by metopimazine,  xxxd312xxx , and chlorpromazine (table 2).

catalepsy (table 2) was induced with all compounds that
inhibited ap-induced stereotyped behavior and was clearly
related to the central da receptor blocking activity of the
compounds. palpebral ptosis (table 2) also occurred with all
neuroleptics. metopimazine induced palpebral ptosis at low
doses (eds0 0.50mg/kg). palpebral ptosis was the only
activity recorded for  xxxd1927xxx  in rats, the eds0 of
6.09 mg/kg sc being extremely high when compared to the
antiemetic activity in dogs.

the 12 compounds tested varied in their relative potency for
antiemetic and neuroleptic-like (shuttle box) activity in the
dog. only metopimazine,  xxxd1927xxx , and, to a lesser
extent,  xxxd2956xxx  showed appreciable specificity of antiemetic
effect with ed s o raft os (neuroleptic: antiemetic) of 197, 318,
and 18.2, respectively9 metopimazine and  xxxd1927xxx ,
therefore, can be considered specific antiemetics in the dog,
i. e., virtually devoid of central da receptor blocking activity9
the central da receptor blocking activity inferred from
the inhibition of conditioned reactions in the dog is in good
agreement with the results obtained in the ap-antagonism
test in rats. antagonism of ap-induced stereotypy in rats is
considered to reflect central da receptor blocking activity
(niemegeers and janssen 1979).
with regard to the other tests in the rat, tryptamine
antagonism, which reflects antiserotonin activity (tedeschi et
al. 1959), occurred in all compounds except metopimazine
and  xxxd1927xxx . compound 48/80 antagonism in the
absence of antiserotonin activity reflects h 1 antihistamine
activity (awouters et al. 1981). metopimazine is a potent
antihistamine (0.44 mg/kg sc), whereas  xxxd312xxx  and
chlorpromazine are also potent histamine antagonists relative
to their anti-ap activity. thus, metopimazine, which is
devoid of central da receptor blocking activity in the rat,
appears to be a very potent norepinephrine antagonist, a
fairly potent h1 antihistamine, and it induces palpebral ptosis
at low doses.
the relevance of these measurements has previously been
discussed on the basis of the described pharmacological
activities of a great number of compounds (niemegeers and
janssen 1979). therefore, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and other phenomena related to autonomic blockade
may be expected with metopimazine at relatively low doses9
moreover the induction of palpebral ptosis and the potential
central antihistamine activity of the compound include the
risk of chlorpromazine-like hypnosedation at doses close to
the therapeutic dose. when comparing the antiemetic activity
in the dog with the most pronounced central or peripheral
activity in the rat (fig. 1), it is obvious that all compounds
devoid of antiemetic specificity in dogs are also centrally
active da antagonists in the rat.
in conclusion, the present study clearly shows that all
neuroleptics are potent antiemetics in the dog. most of these
compounds possess central activity at doses four- to seventimes the antiemetic dose and there is no difference in this
respect between  xxxd1945xxx , metoclopramide,  xxxd3349xxx , chlorpromazine, haloperidol, prochlorpromazine,
 xxxd374xxx , clebopride, and  xxxd312xxx , which should
be considered neuroleptics.  xxxd2956xxx  is a neuroleptic with a
somewhat higher antiemetic specificity. metopimazine is an
antiemetic devoid of neuroleptic activity, but hypnosedation
and autonomic side effects, common to chlorpromazine-like
