background and purpose: amp-activated protein kinase ( xxxg1830xxx ) is activated by metformin,  xxxd2903xxx , and the amp
mimetic, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-b-d-ribofuranoside (aicar). we have completed an extensive study of the
pharmacological effects of these drugs on  xxxg1830xxx  activation, adenine nucleotide concentration, transepithelial amiloridesensitive (iamiloride) and ouabain-sensitive basolateral (iouabain) short circuit current in h441 lung epithelial cells.
experimental approach: h441 cells were grown on permeable filters at air interface. iamiloride, iouabain and transepithelial
resistance were measured in ussing chambers.  xxxg1830xxx  activity was measured as the amount of radiolabelled phosphate
transferred to the sams peptide. adenine nucleotide concentration was analysed by reverse phase hplc and nad(p)h
autofluorescence was measured using confocal microscopy.
key results:  xxxd2903xxx , aicar and metformin increased  xxxg1830xxx  (a1) activity and decreased iamiloride. the  xxxg1830xxx  inhibitor
 xxxd1930xxx  prevented the action of metformin and aicar but not  xxxd2903xxx .  xxxd2903xxx  and aicar decreased iouabain
across h441 monolayers and decreased monolayer resistance. the decrease in iamiloride was closely related to iouabain with
 xxxd2903xxx , but not in aicar treated monolayers. metformin and  xxxd2903xxx  increased the cellular amp:atp ratio but only
 xxxd2903xxx  and aicar decreased cellular atp.
conclusions and implications: activation of a1- xxxg1830xxx  is associated with inhibition of apical amiloride-sensitive na þ channels
(enac), which has important implications for the clinical use of metformin. additional pharmacological effects evoked by
aicar and  xxxd2903xxx  on iouabain, with potential secondary effects on apical na þ conductance, enac activity and monolayer
resistance, have important consequences for their use as pharmacological activators of  xxxg1830xxx  in cell systems where
na þ k þ atpase is an important component.

introduction
recently, there has been much interest in the action of
amp-activated protein kinase ( xxxg1830xxx ) in cellular signalling
processes, because of its role as a cellular metabolic sensor

and its ability to elicit a wide range of effects in diverse
tissues (hardie, 2003; kemp et al., 2003). this kinase is
activated by an increase in the intracellular ratio of amp:atp,
making it very sensitive to changes in cellular metabolic
status. once activated,  xxxg1830xxx  downregulates pathways that
consume atp and upregulates those that generate atp, in
order to maintain cellular energy stores (hardie, 2003, 2004;
hardie and sakamoto, 2006).
there are several pharmacological agents that have been
used extensively to activate  xxxg1830xxx  in intact cells. these

effect of  xxxg1830xxx  activators on na þ transport
am woollhead et al

include the biguanides metformin, (zhou et al., 2001), its
more potent analogue  xxxd2903xxx  (sakamoto et al., 2004)
and the nucleoside 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-b-dribofuranoside (aicar) (corton et al., 1995).  xxxd2903xxx  is
thought to activate  xxxg1830xxx  by inhibiting complex i of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain (el-mir et al., 2000; owen
et al., 2000), resulting in changes in intracellular levels of
amp and/or the amp:atp ratio (hawley et al., 2005).
 xxxd2903xxx  was used in the clinical treatment of type ii
diabetes, but it has been withdrawn from clinical use in the
uk, due the high incidence of lactic acidosis. metformin,
which has replaced the use of  xxxd2903xxx , also inhibits
complex i (el-mir et al., 2000; owen et al., 2000), but
changes in intracellular amp:atp ratios have been difficult
to determine with this drug (hawley et al., 2002; fryer et al.,
2002b). in contrast to the biguanides, aicar, currently
being considered as a clinical alternative, is taken into the
cell via adenosine transporters (gadalla et al., 2004) and then
converted by  xxxg79xxx  to the monophosphorylated
nucleotide, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-b-d-ribofuranosyl (aicar) 50 monophosphate, or zmp, which binds
to and activates  xxxg1830xxx  in a manner similar to amp. while
these drugs activate  xxxg1830xxx , they may also have other cellular
effects. therefore, the  xxxg1830xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1930xxx 
has been widely used to attribute downstream effects
specifically to the activation of this kinase (zhou et al.,
2001; fryer et al., 2002b).
transport of na þ across the lung epithelium from the
lumen to interstitium is an essential regulator of airway fluid
volume. na þ crosses the epithelial cell apical membrane,
predominantly through the amiloride-sensitive na þ
channel (enac), and is extruded via the basolateral
na þ k þ atpase pump in an energy consuming process.
misregulation of this pathway can lead to accumulation or
dehydration of fluid in the airway and contribute to the
pathogenesis of airway disease (boucher et al., 1988; kerem
et al., 1999). changes in cell metabolism and oxygen tension
have been observed to decrease na þ transport processes
across bronchiolar epithelium and rat alveolar cell monolayers (stutts et al., 1988; ramminger et al., 2000; mairbaeurl
et al., 2002), implying that  xxxg1830xxx  may have a role in the
signalling pathways mediating these events.
we have shown that pharmacological activation of  xxxg1830xxx 
with  xxxd2903xxx  and aicar, for 1 h decreased transepithelial na þ transport, measured as short circuit current (isc), in
h441 airway epithelial cells (woollhead et al., 2005). these
findings provided support for a cellular signalling pathway
that links decreased metabolic status and the consequent
reduction in ion transport processes to activation of  xxxg1830xxx .
consistent with work in xenopus oocytes, we found that this
effect was the result of decreased apical na þ entry through
enac (carattino et al., 2005). however, we also showed that
there was a significant pharmacological effect of these agents
on na þ k þ atpase function, which can also regulate transepithelial transport (woollhead et al., 2005). moreover, our
findings raised the possibility that the widely prescribed drug
metformin, also an activator of  xxxg1830xxx , could additionally
inhibit ion transport processes in the lung.
to investigate the effect of metformin,  xxxd2903xxx  and
aicar in more detail, we have carried out the first extensive

1205

study of the pharmacological effects of these drugs in h441
lung epithelial cells. the data presented here indicate that
although all drugs activated  xxxg1830xxx , they have different
effects on na þ transport processes. our data indicate that
changes in cellular nucleotides, independently of activation
of  xxxg1830xxx , could have additional effects on na þ k þ atpase
function and apical na þ entry, which contribute to the
difference in potency observed with these drugs. these
findings have wide implications for the use of pharmacological activators of  xxxg1830xxx  in other cell systems.

methods
test system used
the human h441 lung epithelial cell line was obtained from
the american type culture collection (atcc) (manassas,
va, usa) and maintained in rosewell park memorial
institute-1640 medium supplemented with foetal bovine
serum (10%) (invitrogen, paisley, scotland, uk), l-glutamine
(2 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), insulin (5 mg ml1), transferrin (5 mg ml1), sodium selenite (7 ng ml1) and antibiotics
(penicillin, 100 u ml1/streptomycin, 100 mg ml1). cells
were seeded in 25 cm2 flasks and incubated in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% co2 at 371c. for functional studies,
h441 cells were seeded on snapwell clear membranes
(costar, vwr, lutterworth, leicestershire, uk) and cultured
overnight. the following day (or when fully confluent) the
serum in the medium was replaced with 4% charcoalstripped serum, with the additional supplement of triiodothyronine (t3) (10 nm) and dexamethasone (200 nm). the
monolayers were cultured for 6–7 days in this medium at air
interface to induce polarization.
measurements made
identification of subunits and measurement of  xxxg1830xxx  activity
pcr. rna was extracted from h441 cells using trizol
(sigma, poole, dorset, uk) with a post-extraction treatment
with 1 u amplification grade dnase1 for 15 min at room
temperature (invitrogen, uk). a 2 mg weight of rna was
reverse transcribed using avian myeloma virus reverse
transcriptase, as previously described (woollhead et al.,
2005). reaction mixtures contained 50 ng of cdna, 10 mm
dntps, 0.2 ml platinum taq polymerase (5 u ml1), 1.5 mm
mgcl2 and 0.8 mm of primer. a1  xxxg1830xxx  primers (50 –30 ;
forward, cggcaaagtgaaggttggcaaa and reverse caaatagctctcctc
ctgagac) gave an expected product size of 227 bp pairs using
cycle conditions of 941c for 1 min, 601c for 1 min and 721c
for 1 min for 35 cycles. a2  xxxg1830xxx  primers, (50 –30 ; forward
ttgggagggtgccacaaagaag and reverse, acgggttgaagagatggaa
gccag) gave an expected product size of 314 bp. cycling
conditions were the same as above, except that the
annealing temperature was raised to 61.11c. amplification
of b-actin (clontech, saint-germain-en-laye, france) was
used as a reaction control. amplified products were resolved
on 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and
visualized with uv light.
western blotting. lysates prepared from h441 cells and rat
liver tissue were heated to 941c for 5 min in the presence of

100 mm dithiothreitol (dtt) and 2% w/v sodium dodecyl
sulphate (sds), to denature the proteins. a 30 mg weight of
protein was subjected to electrophoresis on sds-polyacrylamide gels. fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting and immunostained
with either anti-a1 or -a2  xxxg1830xxx  antiserum, using standard
techniques.
 xxxg1830xxx  activity. h441 cell protein (100 mg) was incubated for
2 h at 41c with 10 mg of  xxxg1830xxx  a1 or a2 antibodies, which
had been prebound to 10 ml of protein g–sepharose. the
immunoprecipitate was then washed 5  1 ml of ice-cold
immunoprecipitation (ip) buffer ((in mm): tris, 50 ph 7.4;
nacl, 1000; naf, 50; na þ pyrophosphate, 5; edta, 1; egta,
1; dtt, 1;  xxxd302xxx , 0.1; phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, 0.1; 5 mg ml1 soybean  xxxd207xxx  and 1% v/v
triton x-100), and then with 5  1 ml of ice-cold ip buffer (as
described above, except containing 150 mm nacl) then with
1  1 ml with assay buffer (50 mm hepes ph 7.4, 1 mm
dtt, 0.02% v/v brij-35). immunopurified  xxxg1830xxx  activity
was measured as the amount of radiolabelled phosphate
transferred to the sams peptide, derived from the sequence
surrounding the major  xxxg1830xxx  site on acetyl-coa carboxylase,
as previously described (hardie et al., 2000; woollhead
et al., 2005).
measurement of isc. monolayers were mounted in ussing
chambers, where the drug was circulated in a physiological
salt solution (in mm): nacl, 117; nahco3, 25; kcl, 4.7;
 xxxd2534xxx , 1.2; kh2po4, 1.2; cacl2, 2.5; d-glucose, 11 (equilibrated with 5% co2 to ph 7.3–7.4). the solution was
maintained at 371c, bubbled with 21% o2 þ 5% co2
premixed gas and continuously circulated throughout the
course of the experiment. control and drug-treated monolayers were analysed in parallel. the monolayers were first
maintained under open-circuit conditions, while transepithelial potential difference (vt) and resistance (rt) were
monitored and observed to reach a stable level. the cells
were then short circuited by clamping vt at 0 mv using a
dvc-4000 voltage/current clamp and the current required to
maintain this condition (isc), was measured and recorded
using a powerlab computer interface. every 30 s, throughout
each experiment, the preparations were returned to opencircuit conditions for 3 s, so that the spontaneous vt could be
measured and rt could be calculated.
amiloride-sensitive transepithelial na þ isc (iamiloride) was
measured by adding 10 mm amiloride to the solution
perfusing the apical side of the monolayer. basolateral
ouabain-sensitive isc (iouabain) was measured by permeabilizing the apical membrane with 75 mm nystatin. the unrestricted access of ions to the intracellular compartment then
causes basolateral isc to rise. once peak levels were achieved,
1 mm ouabain was added to the basolateral compartment to
inhibit na þ k þ atpase activity. the ouabain-sensitive component of isc (iouabain) was calculated as the difference in isc
before and after application of ouabain, and gives a measure
of maximal net transport capacity via na þ k þ atpase
(number of pumps  turnover) in the ionic conditions used
(figures 4a-c).
british journal of pharmacology (2007) 151 1204–1215

measurement of intracellular adenine nucleotide concentration. adenine nucleotides—atp, adp, amp and tan (total
adenine nucleotides)—were determined in untreated monolayers or those treated with  xxxd2903xxx , aicar or metformin for 4 h. cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs), and then cold (0.4 m) perchloric acid was added
to extract the nucleotides. cell extracts were neutralized
with 3 m k3po4 and were analysed with high-performance
liquid chromatography, according to the reverse-phase
procedures described previously in detail (smolenski et al.,
1990; kalsi et al., 1999). the equipment used was the
hewlett-packard 1100 series linked to a diode array detector.
protein content was determined in the perchlorate precipitate by using the bradford assay.
measurement of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate)
(nad(p)h) autofluorescence. cells seeded on coverslips were
grown to subconfluence prior to treatment for 1–4 h with
 xxxd2903xxx , aicar or metformin and mounted in a
perfusion chamber containing phenol red free culture
medium (invitrogen, uk) at room temperature. patches of
cells were imaged using a zeiss lsm 510 laser scanning
confocal microscope (carl zeiss, jena, germany) with a
blue diode laser and excitation at 405 nm. emitted
fluorescence was captured using lsm 510 software (release
3.2, carl zeiss, jena, germany) via a zeiss apochromat  63
oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4). there was
no discernable effect on cell confluence or viability from
treatment with the drugs.

experimental design
for short circuit current measurement, sets of snapwells (up
to 12, plated at the same time and cultured under similar
conditions for a similar length of time) supporting resistive
monolayers of h441 cells (x300 o cm2) were treated in
culture with 5 mm  xxxd2903xxx , 2 mm aicar or 2 mm
metformin for 1–48 h. the concentrations of  xxxd2903xxx 
and aicar have been shown to elicit a similar elevation of
 xxxg1830xxx  activity in h441 cells (woollhead et al., 2005), and
2 mm metformin has been shown to similarly elevate  xxxg1830xxx 
activity in other cell systems (fryer et al., 2002a). we also
used 0.5 mm  xxxd2903xxx , which we have previously shown
to elevate  xxxg1830xxx  activity twofold after a 1 h treatment
(woollhead et al., 2005). cells were pretreated with  xxxd1930xxx  (80 mm) (calbiochem, nottingham, uk) for 40 min
before treatment with  xxxd2903xxx , aicar or metformin as
above. all agents were suspended in culture medium or as a
1000  concentrated stock in dimethyl sulphoxide. untreated cells were overlaid with culture medium alone or
treated with vehicle control. at the end of each functional
experiment, the cell monolayers were rinsed in ice-cold pbs
and harvested into lysis buffer for analysis of  xxxg1830xxx  activity
(in mm): tris, 50 (ph 7.4); nacl, 150; naf, 50; na pyrophosphate, 5; edta, 1; egta, 1; dtt, 1; 1% v/v triton x-100 and
1% protease inhibitor cocktail (sigma, uk). h441 cell
suspensions were then stored at 801c until required. cell
viability in untreated monolayers and those treated with
metformin,  xxxd2903xxx  and aicar for 1, 4, 8 and 24 h was

assessed by trypan blue exclusion. adherent (and any nonadherent cells) present in the transwell chamber were
released from the filter by incubation with trypsin/edta
solution (sigma, uk) (200 ml) for 15 min at 371c. cells were
resuspended in full culture medium and aliquots were mixed
with an equal volume of trypan blue (sigma, uk). white
(live) and blue (blue) cells were counted (cells ml1) using
fast read counting chambers (isl ltd., paignton, devon, uk)
and the live/dead cell ratio (indicative of cell viability) was
calculated.

data analysis and statistical procedures
since the resistance and basal levels of ion transport across
the monolayers varied between batches of cells, control
experiments and treatments were carried out on monolayers
plated on the same day. results are compiled from at least
three independent sets of cells. data are presented as
mean7s.e.m. in table 1. in figures 3–5, isc is presented
graphically as percentage of control isc to facilitate comparison between the pharmacological agents and effects
on transepithelial amiloride-sensitive short circuit current
(iamiloride) and iouabain.
statistical analysis was carried out using one-way analysis
of variance (anova) with a post hoc gabriel’s pairwise test
(kendall and stuart, 1968) or student’s t-tests, where
applicable; p-values of o 0.05 were considered significant.
results are presented as mean7s.e.m.

drugs
all drugs and reagents were purchased from sigma
(poole, uk), unless otherwise stated.

results
 xxxg1830xxx  isoforms in h441 cells
pcr analysis using primers to amplify sequences derived
from a1 and a2 catalytic subunits of  xxxg1830xxx  showed that
mrna products encoding both isoforms were present in
h441 cells. however, amplified products from a1  xxxg1830xxx  were
more abundant than those of a2 from similar starting
quantities of cdna. this was not due to inefficiency of the
a2 primers, because amplification of both isoforms was
similar from rna extracted from our positive control
(human ovarian tissue). the a1 subunit was also more
readily detectable than the a2 subunit, in h441 cells, by

1207

western blotting (figures 1a and b). treatment of h441 cells
with either 5 mm  xxxd2903xxx  or 2 mm aicar for 1 h induced
a significant increase in  xxxg1830xxx  activity of the a1 isoform.
there was almost undetectable activity associated with the
a2 isoform of  xxxg1830xxx  (0.00470.001 nmol min1 mg1, n ¼ 6),
and this was not significantly changed by treatment with
either  xxxd2903xxx  or aicar (figure 1c).

time course of effect of  xxxd2903xxx , aicar and metformin on
 xxxg1830xxx  activity
treatment of h441 cells with 5 mm  xxxd2903xxx , 2 mm
aicar and 2 mm metformin significantly increased  xxxg1830xxx 
activity over time (one-way anova, f5,12 ¼ 5.45, p ¼ 0.0076;
f5,12 ¼ 9.34, p ¼ 0.0008 and f4,10 ¼ 49.83, p ¼ 0.0001).  xxxd2903xxx  and aicar increased  xxxg1830xxx  activity approximately 
twofold after 0.5 h, and elevated activity was sustained at 4, 8
and 24 h (n ¼ 3). there was no significant difference between
 xxxd2903xxx - and aicar-induced  xxxg1830xxx  activity at any time
point, up to 24 h. the metformin-induced increase in  xxxg1830xxx 
activity was significantly less than that induced by  xxxd2903xxx  or aicar, at 4 and 8 h (po0.01 and po0.05, n ¼ 3,
respectively), but reached similar levels by 24 h (figure 2).

effect of  xxxd2903xxx , aicar and metformin on transepithelial
resistance
to further investigate the differences in pharmacological
effect of these drugs, we investigated their effect on
transepithelial resistance (rt) of h441 monolayers used in
this study. this was lower at b300 o cm2 than we have
previously published, and we have found this to be a
consequence of passage number. however, spontaneous isc
and the component of current that was amiloride sensitive
remained similar at 3472 ma cm2 and 8575%, respectively.
compared to untreated monolayers, there was no significant
change in rt of metformin-treated monolayers at any of the
time points studied. however, we did observe a decrease in
resistance in monolayers treated with 5 mm  xxxd2903xxx  after
8 h (po0.01, n ¼ 4) (figure 3). we were unable to measure a
significant rt across monolayers 24 h after treatment with
5 mm  xxxd2903xxx  and 2 mm aicar (figure 3). compared to
controls, these snapwell membranes were flooded with
medium on their apical surface.
to exclude the possibility that effects on rt were the result
of a drop in cell viability, we used trypan blue exclusion to
assess the viability of cells contained within the transwell.
we found that there was neither a significant elevation in

metformin did not significantly inhibit iamiloride after 1 h, but
did inhibit iamiloride after 4 h (figure 4a). therefore, these
treatment times were used in subsequent experiments.
 xxxd2903xxx  and aicar also inhibited iouabain, but metformin after 4 h had no significant effect on iouabain (figure 4b).
pretreatment of monolayers with the  xxxg1830xxx  inhibitor,
 xxxd1930xxx , did not prevent the inhibitory effect of

summarized in figure 6.  xxxd2903xxx  (5 mm) induced a
significant decrease in amiloride-sensitive transepithelial isc
(iamiloride) over a time course of 8 h (one-way anova,
f5,16 ¼ 9.23, p ¼ 0.0003). a decrease in iamiloride from
37.974.5 to 24.271.0 ma cm2, p ¼ 0.05, n ¼ 4 was observed
at 15 min. such a rapid decrease in iamiloride was not seen
with 2 mm aicar or 2 mm metformin. iamiloride decreased
to minimal levels (b17% of control levels) at 4–8 h. further
changes in iamiloride could not be determined after 8 h,
because of loss of resistance of the monolayer (see above)
inhibition of iamiloride by 5 mm  xxxd2903xxx  followed an
exponential decay curve (r2 ¼ 0.88) and the time required
to reduce iamiloride to half-maximal values was 31 min
(figures 5a and 6a). interestingly, a 10-fold lower concentra-

tion of  xxxd2903xxx  (0.5 mm) also induced a significant
exponential reduction in iamiloride over time (one-way
anova, f5,12 ¼ 8.21, p ¼ 0.0014) (r2 ¼ 0.97) (data not
shown). aicar inhibition of iamiloride was slower than that
observed with  xxxd2903xxx , half-maximal values were
achieved after 60 min and minimal plateau levels were 13
% of control, (one-way anova, f3,14 ¼ 6.99, p ¼ 0.0042)
(r2 ¼ 0.97) (figures 5b and 6b). metformin also induced a
significant change in iamiloride over time (one-way anova,
f4,16 ¼ 6.15, p ¼ 0.003), but it had the slowest effect of all
the pharmacological drugs tested. compared to control, an
apparent reduction in iamiloride was observed 1 h posttreatment, but this did not reach statistical significance until
4 h (po0.06 and po0.01, respectively, n ¼ 4). half-maximal
reduction of iamiloride was not achieved until 358 min (b6 h)
post-treatment. in addition, iamiloride remained higher at
every corresponding time point compared to all other
treatments (figures 5c and 6c).

time course of effect of  xxxd2903xxx , aicar and metformin on
ouabain-sensitive basolateral isc (iouabain)
a typical example of an isc trace showing iouabain for one time
point (4 h post-drug treatment) is given in figure 5. the
complete time course is summarized in figure 6.  xxxd2903xxx 
(5 mm) induced a significant decrease in ouabain-sensitive
basolateral isc (iouabain), which could be attributed to net
na þ k þ atpase transport capacity, over a time course of 8 h
(one-way anova, f5,16 ¼ 4.89, p ¼ 0.007). a significant
decrease in iouabain from 59.2712.6 to 30.472.6 ma cm2,
po0.05, n ¼ 4 was observed at 15 min. this was not observed
with 2 mm aicar or 2 mm metformin. iouabain reached
minimal levels at 4–8 h. inhibition of iouabain followed an
exponential decay curve (r2 ¼ 0.85) and the time required for
5 mm  xxxd2903xxx  to reduce iouabain by half was 12 min, more
rapid than that observed to reduce iamiloride. minimum
iouabain plateau levels were 26% of control levels (figures 5a
and 6a). a concentration of 2 mm of aicar significantly
decreased iouabain at 1 and 4 h, compared to control (po0.05,
n ¼ 5 and n ¼ 4, respectively). an exponential curve fitted to
the experimental data (r2 ¼ 0.65) indicated that 50% maximal values occurred at 40 min. minimal iouabain levels were
achieved by 4 h, but were only reduced to 66% of control
levels (table 1; figures 5b and 6b). there was an apparent
decline in iouabain after metformin treatment. fitting a
similar exponential curve to this data indicated that
metformin reduced pump activity to 89% of control levels,
with 50% maximal values occurring at 70 min (r2 ¼ 0.1).
however, we were unable to attribute significance to the
changes in these experiments (one-way anova, f4,16 ¼ 0.94,
p ¼ 0.5) (figures 5c and 6c).

relationship between iamiloride and iouabain
the relationship between iamiloride and iouabain was different
between the pharmacological treatments. iouabain reflects the
basolateral transport capacity of na þ k þ atpase, which is
critical for the generation and maintenance of the intracellular gradient for na þ movement into the cell via the
amiloride-sensitive channel enac. thus, changes in iouabain

can directly influence iamiloride.  xxxd2903xxx  induced a
similar rapid exponential decrease in both iamiloride and
iouabain (figure 6a), indicating that inhibition of
na þ k þ atpase transport capacity could mediate the decrease
in iamiloride. aicar also induced a decrease in iamiloride, but
the inhibitory effect on iouabain was much less than that on
iamiloride (see above) (figure 6b). furthermore, we could not
attribute a significant effect of metformin on iouabain, yet it
significantly reduced iamiloride (figure 6c). plotting values
obtained for iamiloride against iouabain from the 0, 1, 4 and 8 h
time points ( xxxd2903xxx  and aicar) and the 0, 1, 4, 8 and
24 h points (metformin) obtained in the time course study
showed that there was a significant linear relationship
between the two parameters only when monolayers were
treated with  xxxd2903xxx  (r2 ¼ 0.97, slope ¼ 0.6870.08,
p ¼ 0.01, n ¼ 4) (figure 7a). these data indicate that the
inhibition of iamiloride is closely related to the inhibition of
iouabain in cells treated with  xxxd2903xxx , but not in cells
treated with aicar and metformin (figures 7b and c).

with  xxxd2903xxx  and aicar, we investigated the amount of

cellular nucleotides at this time, as we hypothesized that
alteration of cellular nucleotides could have additional
effects on enac and na þ k þ atpase. treatment with  xxxd2903xxx  decreased cellular atp (table 1). this was associated
with significant increases in cellular adp and amp, and a
fivefold increase in the amp:atp ratio compared to control
(table 1). metformin also increased adp, amp and the
amp:atp ratio (1.3-fold compared to control), but these
changes were much smaller than that seen with  xxxd2903xxx ,
and we could not detect any changes in cellular atp levels.
these data are consistent with their action as inhibitors of
complex 1 of the respiratory chain. interestingly, aicar
significantly decreased cellular atp and adp. this was
associated with a decrease in the total adenine nucleotide
pool and did not change the amp:atp or adp:atp ratios
compared to controls (table 1).

there was a significant increase in nad(p)h autofluorescence in cells treated with  xxxd2903xxx  for 1 h, compared to
controls. no autofluorescence was detected in cells treated

discussion and conclusions
we previously showed that both isoforms of  xxxg1830xxx , a1 and
a2, were present in h441 cells (woollhead et al., 2005). in
this study, we show that it is the a1 catalytic subunit of
 xxxg1830xxx  that is predominantly expressed and pharmacologically activated in h441 lung cells. consistent with our
findings, a1- xxxg1830xxx  protein has been localized to the apical
membrane of polarized human bronchiolar epithelial cells
and catalytic activity was associated with the a1 subunit in
calu-3 lung epithelial cells (crawford et al., 2005; hallows

increased lipophilic nature of  xxxd2903xxx  (jalling and
olsen, 1984; holstein and egberts, 2006).  xxxg1830xxx  is reported
to be activated by very small changes in the amp:atp ratio,
because of its ultrasensitive mechanism of activation (hardie
et al., 1999). however, we suggest that the level of  xxxg1830xxx 
activity induced by the biguanides in h441 cells is related to
their effect on the amp:atp ratio.
as expected, aicar did not change the cellular amp:atp
ratio or nad(p)h levels, consistent with its direct action on
 xxxg1830xxx . however, it did decrease the cellular content of atp,
adp and amp in h441 cells. why this occurred is unclear. in
short-term incubations (up to 1 h) of rat hepatocytes and
cultured mouse muscle cells, 0.5 mm aicar has been
reported not to affect cellular atp, adp or amp levels
(corton et al., 1995; fryer et al., 2002a) and in chinese
hamster ovary (cho) cells incubated for up to 10 h aicar
transiently increased atp and its diphosphate and monophosphate forms (sabina et al., 1985).

iamiloride
we show that metformin decreased transepithelial amiloride-sensitive na þ transport (iamiloride) across h441 cells. the
effect of metformin was slower than that of aicar or
 xxxd2903xxx  and mirrored the lower level of a1- xxxg1830xxx 
activity. thus, together with our previous findings, these
data indicate that activation of  xxxg1830xxx  was the mechanism by
which these drugs inhibited iamiloride. in support of this, we
found that the  xxxg1830xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1930xxx  prevented the
aicar- and metformin-induced reduction in iamiloride. in
contrast,  xxxd1930xxx  did not prevent the inhibitory action
of  xxxd2903xxx . this finding contradicts our previous
suggestion that  xxxd2903xxx  acted via  xxxg1830xxx  to decrease
iamiloride. it is important to note that the specificity of
 xxxd1930xxx  has not been fully reported (zhou et al., 2001),
and some caution is required in the interpretation of its
effect. however, this new finding raises the possibility that
 xxxd2903xxx  elicited an effect on iamiloride that was either
independent of, or additional to, pharmacological activation
of  xxxg1830xxx .
transepithelial iamiloride can be decreased by inhibition of
apical enac channels and/or by downregulating basolateral
na þ k þ atpase transport capacity, which would reduce the
na þ gradient and the driving force for na þ transport via
enac. the most likely explanation for our new observation
that metformin elevated  xxxg1830xxx  activity and inhibited
iamiloride, but had no significant effect on na þ k þ atpase,
would be that activation of  xxxg1830xxx  must primarily inhibit
apical na þ entry, via the amiloride-sensitive na þ channel
enac, to decrease iamiloride independently of effects on
na þ k þ atpase function. this hypothesis would also explain
why the fall in iamiloride was greater than that of iouabain when
cells were treated with aicar, and why there was no
significant relationship between the fall in iamiloride and
iouabain over time with metformin or aicar. although we
have not yet fully investigated the effect of metformin on
apical na þ conductance (gna þ ), we have previously shown
that treatment of h441 cells with aicar decreased apical
amiloride-sensitive gna þ (woollhead et al., 2005). furthermore, carattino et al. (2005) showed that injection of zmp

1213

(the active form of aicar) and constitutively active  xxxg1830xxx 
inhibited the activity of enacs expressed in xenopus oocytes.
the rapid effect (within 4 h) of aicar on iamiloride
determined in this study and our previous study would
support a post-transcriptional mechanism of action of  xxxg1830xxx 
on enac-mediated na þ transport. this could include
changes in enac open probability (po) and/or the number
of channels in the membrane (n) by disruption of the normal
enac retrieval and recycling processes (carattino et al.,
2005). however, the further decline in iamiloride associated
with aicar and metformin between 8 and 24 h means that
we cannot exclude additional effects of  xxxg1830xxx  on enac gene
transcription or rna stability in these cells. both possibilities
are the subject of further study.

iouabain
 xxxd2903xxx  and aicar both inhibited iouabain, although the
effect of aicar was less potent and was reversible with
 xxxd1930xxx . interestingly, an effect common to  xxxd2903xxx  and aicar, but not metformin, was that they evoked a
significant decrease in monolayer resistance (rt) after 8 h. as
a reduction in the live/dead cell ratio was only observed after
a 24 h treatment with  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin but not
aicar, we reasoned that the effect on rt was unlikely to be
due to a reduction in cellular viability. recent reports have
indicated that na þ k þ atpase is important in regulating
tight junction formation (kaplan, 2005; rajasekaran et al.,
2005). thus, the inhibition of its transport capacity by
 xxxd2903xxx  and aicar may be the mechanism by which
epithelial resistance is lost.
reduction of the intracellular na þ concentration intracellular na þ ([na þ ]i) by inhibition of apical na þ entry has
been shown to decrease na þ k þ atpase surface expression
and activity in cortical collecting duct cells (vinciguerra
et al., 2003). however, our new data show that the inhibition
of iouabain preceded inhibition of iamiloride and there was no
significant correlation between the inhibition of iamiloride
and iouabain with aicar or metformin. we previously
suggested that activation of  xxxg1830xxx  with  xxxd2903xxx  and
aicar could inhibit na þ k þ atpase directly. the finding
that aicar inhibition of iouabain was reversed by compound
c would support our suggestion. however,  xxxd1930xxx  did
not reverse the effect of  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin
activated  xxxg1830xxx , but had no effect on iouabain. these findings
raise the possibility that other mechanisms are involved.
both  xxxd2903xxx  and aicar decreased cellular atp levels
(metformin did not) and na þ k þ atpase function is dependent on atp concentration. we previously suggested that
only a drastic depletion of atp would alter na þ k þ atpase
activity (boldyrev et al., 1991; woollhead et al., 2005).
however, more recent evidence indicates that the relationship between intracellular atp concentration and
na þ k þ atpase function is non-hyperbolic and involves
binding of atp to both high- and low-affinity sites on the
protein (ward and cavieres, 1998; ward et al., 2006). thus, a
reduction in atp could lead to a decrease in na þ k þ atpase
function. certainly, a diminution of atp in renal cortical
tubular cells (coux et al., 2001) and reduced atp levels in rat
cerebellar granule cells (petrushanko et al., 2006) were

effect of  xxxg1830xxx  activators on na þ transport
am woollhead et al

associated with a reduction of na þ k þ atpase function.
moreover,  xxxd1930xxx  has been shown to inhibit aicar
uptake into cells and subsequent accumulation of zmp. it
could, therefore, prevent the effect on cellular nucleotides,
in addition to any direct inhibition of  xxxg1830xxx  activity (fryer
et al., 2002b). in vitro, na þ k þ atpase transport activity is also
decreased by increased adp concentration (boldyrev et al.,
1991). as cellular adp levels were increased 200% by
 xxxd2903xxx ; this could be an additional factor contributing
to the greater inhibition of iouabain by this drug compared to
aicar. finally, luly et al. (1977) showed that  xxxd2903xxx 
rapidly inhibited na þ k þ atpase activity in isolated liver
plasma membranes. their suggestion that  xxxd2903xxx  could
alter the physico-chemical properties of the membrane and
change the activities of membrane bound enzymes could
provide another  xxxg1830xxx -independent mechanism of action.
whatever the mechanism, the powerful inhibitory effect
of  xxxd2903xxx  on iouabain could underlie the  xxxg1830xxx -independent action and the more potent effect on iamiloride
compared to aicar. inhibition of na þ k þ atpase would
elevate [na þ ]i, reducing the driving force for na þ entry.
increases in [na þ ]i have also been shown to decrease enac
activity by ‘feedback inhibition’ (garty and palmer, 1997) in
a number of cell systems, including salivary duct cells
(dinudom et al., 1998), rat cortical collecting tubule (frindt
et al., 1995) and xenopus oocytes expressing enac (abriel
and horisberger, 1999). the observation that there was a
very close relationship between iamiloride and iouabain in cells
treated with  xxxd2903xxx , coupled with our previous finding
that  xxxd2903xxx  decreased apical gna þ , indicates that the
 xxxg1830xxx -independent action of  xxxd2903xxx  could involve
such a mechanism.
in conclusion, we show for the first time that metformin
decreases transepithelial amiloride-sensitive na þ transport
across h441 lung cells. this finding has significant implications for its future therapeutic use. we also show that the
three pharmacological activators of  xxxg1830xxx  we have used
have different effects on na þ transport processes across lung
epithelium. importantly, our data show that while pharmacological activation of a1- xxxg1830xxx  is associated with inhibition
of amiloride-sensitive na þ channels (enac), additional
changes in intracellular nucleotide levels (aicar and
 xxxd2903xxx ) and potential effects on membrane fluidity
( xxxd2903xxx ) could also affect basolateral na þ k þ atpase
transport capacity, with ensuing effects on apical na þ
conductance, enac activity and monolayer resistance. more
work is now required to elucidate the cellular mechanisms by
which  xxxg1830xxx  and cellular nucleotide concentrations
evoke such changes. in the interim, these findings have
important consequences for the clinical use of pharmacological activators of  xxxg1830xxx , and the interpretation of
their effect in other cell systems where na þ k þ atpase is
an important component.
