 xxxd2227xxx  regulates reproduction. a second form,
designated gnrh ii, selectively binds type ii gnrh
receptors. amino acids of the type i  xxxg931xxx 
required for binding of  xxxd2227xxx  ( xxxg241xxx .61(98),
asn2.65(102), and lys3.32(121)) are conserved in the
type ii  xxxg931xxx , but their roles in receptor
function are unknown. we have delineated their
functions using mutagenesis, signaling and binding assays, immunoblotting, and computational
modeling. mutating  xxxg241xxx .61(97) to glu or ala,
asn2.65(101) to ala, or lys3.32(120) to gln decreased
potency of gnrh ii-stimulated inositol phosphate
production. consistent with proposed roles in ligand recognition, mutations eliminated measurable binding of gnrh ii, whereas expression of
mutant receptors was not decreased. in detailed
analysis of how these residues affect ligand-dependent signaling, [ xxxg614xxx ]- xxxd2227xxx  showed lesser

decreases in potency than  xxxd2227xxx  at the
 xxxg241xxx .61(97)glu mutant. in contrast, [ xxxg614xxx ]-gnrh ii
showed the same loss of potency as gnrh ii at this
mutant. this suggests that  xxxg241xxx .61(97) contributes
to recognition of his2 of  xxxd2227xxx , but not of gnrh ii.
gnrh ii showed a large decrease in potency at the
asn2.65(101)ala mutant compared with analogs
lacking the cao group of gly10nh2. this suggests
that asn2.65(101) recognizes gly10nh2 of gnrh ii.
gnrh agonists showed large decreases in potency
at the lys3.32(120)gln mutant, but antagonist activity
was unaffected. this suggests that lys3.32(120) recognizes agonists, but not antagonists, as in the
type i receptor. these data indicate that roles of
conserved residues are similar, but not identical, in
the type i and ii gnrh receptors. (molecular endocrinology 21: 281–292, 2007)

t

tion of energy intake, and regulation of cell proliferation (6–12). the wide expression and conservation of
gnrh ii indicate that it has an important function and
led to the cloning of specific receptors with high affinity for gnrh ii (13, 14).
consistent with its known function, the type i gnrh
receptor has high affinity for  xxxd2227xxx  and lower affinity
for gnrh ii (15–17). genes for a type ii  xxxg931xxx 
(nomenclature of ref. 13) have been identified in several mammals (14, 16, 18, 19). type ii gnrh receptors
have high affinity for gnrh ii and much lower affinity
for  xxxd2227xxx  (14, 16). gnrh receptors are members of
the rhodopsin-like family of seven-transmembrane domain g protein-coupled receptors. both  xxxg931xxx  subtypes couple to the gq/11 family of g proteins,
which activate phospholipase c and stimulate production of inositol trisphosphate. the significant activity of
the gnrh ii peptide at the type i  xxxg931xxx  pre-

he decapeptide hormone,  xxxd2227xxx  is the central regulator of reproduction. its high-affinity binding to receptors, designated type i gnrh receptors,
leads to synthesis and release of the gonadotropic
hormones, which regulate the gonads. a second form
of gnrh, gnrh ii, is widely conserved among vertebrates, including humans and nonhuman primates (1–
3). gnrh ii is found in the central nervous system and
a range of peripheral tissues (2–7). although the function of gnrh ii is not fully understood, studies have
suggested roles in neuromodulation, differential release of lh and fsh, reproductive behavior, regula-

cludes use of the naturally occurring peptides to distinguish the physiological functions of the different
 xxxg931xxx  subtypes. consequently, identification
of high-affinity ligands, particularly antagonists that
specifically bind the type ii  xxxg931xxx , would
contribute significantly to defining the function of this
receptor.
gnrh ii differs from  xxxd2227xxx  at three positions, having his5 instead of tyr5, trp7 instead of  xxxg234xxx , and tyr8
instead of arg8. one or more of these differences must
account for the higher affinity of gnrh ii at type ii
gnrh receptors. structure-activity studies of type i
gnrh receptors have established that the arg8 residue of  xxxd2227xxx  is critical for high-affinity interactions
with the type i  xxxg931xxx  (13, 15). in addition to
arg8, conserved residues at the amino and carboxy
termini are necessary for interaction with type i gnrh
receptors, and the amino-terminal residues, his2 and
trp3, are particularly important for receptor activation
(reviewed in ref. 20).
ligand structure-activity relationships have been
less thoroughly studied at the type ii gnrh receptors.
trp7 and tyr8 of gnrh ii are important for binding to
the type ii  xxxg931xxx  (21)(ott, t., z.-l. lu, r.
sellar, p. barran, a.j. pawson, and r.p. millar in preparation). as is the case for the type i  xxxg931xxx ,
peptide analogs with d-amino acid substitutions at the
amino terminus act as antagonists of the type ii gnrh
receptor (21, 22). this suggests that the conserved
amino-terminal residues of gnrh ii contribute to activation of type ii gnrh receptors.
ligand binding is the initial step in  xxxg931xxx 
activation, but little is known about the ligand binding
pocket of the type ii  xxxg931xxx . a study using
chimeric receptors (23) has indicated that the extracellular end of transmembrane 7 of the type ii gnrh
receptor selectively decreases affinity for  xxxd2227xxx , but
it remains unclear which residues of the type ii gnrh
receptor account for high-affinity recognition of gnrh
ii.
it is tacitly assumed that functional groups that are
conserved in both ligands and receptors will form
identical interactions in different ligand-receptor pairs
(23, 24). however, the suggestion that different gnrh
peptides have distinct intramolecular interactions that
affect their conformation and their affinity for the type
i  xxxg931xxx  (25) suggests that the ligand binding
pockets of different gnrh receptors may differ. this
concept is well established in the tachykinin receptor
system, where it has been shown that highly homologous peptides have distinct binding contacts in the
neurokinin  xxxg2242xxx , and it is believed that different ligands bind to distinct receptor conformations
(26, 27). consequently, functional groups that are conserved between  xxxd2227xxx  and gnrh ii may not interact
with equivalent residues of the type i and type ii gnrh
receptors. in the type i  xxxg931xxx , the gly10nh2
moiety of  xxxd2227xxx , which is conserved in all variant
forms of gnrh (13, 28), is thought to form a hydrogen
bond with the asn2.65(102) side chain of the receptor

mamputha et al. • type ii  xxxg931xxx  ligand responses

(fig. 1a) (29). asn2.65(102) is conserved in all gnrh
receptors, suggesting the potential for a conserved
interaction between the conserved receptor and ligand residues in all  xxxg931xxx -ligand pairs. like
asn2.65(102),  xxxg241xxx .61(98) is conserved in all gnrh receptors, and it appears to form a hydrogen bond with
the his2 residue of  xxxd2227xxx  (30), which is conserved in
gnrh ii. however,  xxxg241xxx .61(98) also forms additional
interactions, including an intramolecular interaction
with lys3.32(121) (fig. 1a) (30). lys3.32(121), which is also
conserved, is required for high-affinity interactions
with gnrh agonists, but not for gnrh antagonists,
and it was suggested that the lys3.32(121) side chain
might interact with one of the conserved amino-terminal residues of agonist ligands (fig. 1a) (31).
improved understanding of gnrh ii and its receptor
at the molecular level may provide tools to delineate
their physiological function, and comparative studies
potentially yield insight into the functions of the type i
 xxxg931xxx . we have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate whether the conserved residues,
 xxxg241xxx .61(97), asn2.65(101), and lys3.32(120), are important
for ligand interactions of the type ii  xxxg931xxx ,
and we have used ligand modifications and computational modeling to determine whether intermolecular
interactions of these residues are conserved. we show
that all three receptor residues are critical for binding
of gnrh ii. ip accumulation assays indicate that the
functions of asn2.65(101) and lys3.32(120) are similar to
what was found for equivalent residues of the type i
 xxxg931xxx . although we find that  xxxg241xxx .61(97) of the
type ii  xxxg931xxx  contributes to recognition of
his2 of  xxxd2227xxx , it does not distinguish the residues in
position 2 of its cognate ligand, gnrh ii. consistent
with this, our independently constructed molecular
model of the gnrh ii-type ii  xxxg931xxx  complex
shows an interaction of his2 of gnrh ii with
lys3.32(120), but not with  xxxg241xxx .61(97). these results provide evidence that contacts between conserved ligand
and receptor residues in one receptor subtype do not
necessarily all occur in other receptor subtypes and
show that gnrh receptors have subtle differences in
ligand recognition.

results
mutation of conserved residues abolishes highaffinity binding of gnrh ii
to determine whether the conserved residues are important for binding gnrh ii, the ability of mutant receptors (fig. 1a) to bind gnrh ii was measured using
a [125i]gnrh ii competition binding assay. the wildtype receptor bound gnrh ii with high affinity (ic50,
4.8 nm) (fig. 1b). mutant receptors with substitutions
of glu or ala for  xxxg241xxx .61(97), ala for asn2.65(101), or gln
for lys3.32(120) showed no measurable specific binding
of [125i]gnrh ii (fig. 1b). this shows that the conserved residues were important for receptor function,

but the absence of specific binding of [125i]gnrh ii
indicates either that the expression of the mutant receptors is compromised or that their affinity for gnrh
ii is decreased.
quantitative immunoblotting was used to determine
expression levels of flag epitope-tagged wild-type and
mutant receptors and to assess whether the absence of
binding of the mutant receptors was due to decreased
expression. all epitope-tagged receptor constructs
yielded specific bands of approximately 38,000 molecular weight. expression of the  xxxg241xxx .61(97)ala mutant receptor was increased compared with the wild-type receptor, whereas expression of other mutant receptors
was not significantly different from wild type (fig. 1c and
table 1). this shows that the decreased ligand binding of
mutant receptors was not due to decreased expression
and must therefore result from decreased affinity for
gnrh ii. this shows that the mutant receptors have
decreased affinity for gnrh ii and that the mutated residues are required for high-affinity binding. we have previously found that increasing the concentrations of radiolabeled gnrh ligands in binding assays leads to
increased nonspecific binding that makes it difficult to
distinguish specific binding from nonspecific (32). consequently, it is not technically feasible to use increased
tracer concentrations or saturation binding assays to
determine ligand binding affinities of receptors with decreased affinity for [125i]gnrh ii, and we considered
whether a functional assay could be used to assess
ligand interactions of mutant receptors.

in our previous studies, which investigated  xxxd2227xxx 
interaction with the type i  xxxg931xxx , receptor mutations also resulted in undetectable ligand binding (29–
31). however, ligand-receptor interactions were sufficient to elicit inositol phosphate (ip) production and allow
characterization of mutant receptors. we therefore
tested gnrh ii stimulation of ip production at mutant
type ii gnrh receptors. gnrh ii stimulated ip production at the wild-type and all mutant receptors, showing
that the mutant receptors were functional (fig. 1d and
table 1). however, consistent with the apparent decreases in affinity, the potency of gnrh ii was decreased
at all mutant receptors (ec50 values, 3.5–152 nm) compared with the wild-type receptor (ec50, 0.19 nm). the
conservative mutation of the carboxylate  xxxg241xxx .61(97) side

ii potency (273-fold). gnrh ii-stimulated ip production
by epitope-tagged and untagged receptors was similar
(data not shown). because expression of the mutant
receptors was not significantly decreased, the decreased potency of gnrh ii in stimulating ip production,
combined with the lack of measurable gnrh ii binding,
indicates that the mutant receptors are well expressed
and able to couple to intracellular signaling, but have
decreased affinity for gnrh ii. because the decreased
affinity of gnrh ii binding precluded use of binding assays, ip assays were used as a proxy for binding assays
to further assess interactions of the conserved receptor
residues with gnrh ii.

ing that both the carboxylate functional group and its
position relative to the peptide backbone are important
for receptor function. these comparable decreases in
potency for both peptides at each mutant receptor show
that  xxxg241xxx .61(97) does not discriminate between the presence and absence of his2 in gnrh ii. this shows that
 xxxg241xxx .61(97) of the type ii  xxxg931xxx  does not contribute to recognition of his2 of gnrh ii, although it
clearly has some other role in recognizing gnrh ii.

gnrh receptors
to assess the contribution of  xxxg241xxx .61(97) of the type ii
 xxxg931xxx  to recognition of his2 of gnrh ii, we
compared ip production mediated by gnrh ii and
 xxxd2227xxx , both of which have his2 and the analogs,
[ xxxg614xxx ]-gnrh ii and [ xxxg614xxx ]- xxxd2227xxx , which have trp substituted for his2. [ xxxg614xxx ]- xxxd2227xxx  had decreased potency
(ec50, 73.8 nm) compared with  xxxd2227xxx  (ec50, 5.9 nm)
in the wild-type receptor, showing that his2 of  xxxd2227xxx 
was required for maximal potency in the type ii gnrh
receptor (fig. 2 and table 2). [ xxxg614xxx ]- xxxd2227xxx  showed a
smaller decrease in potency at the  xxxg241xxx .61(97)glu mutant (10-fold) compared with his2-containing  xxxd2227xxx 
(181-fold). this is similar to what was found in the type
i  xxxg931xxx  and shows that  xxxg241xxx .61(97) of the type ii
 xxxg931xxx  contributes to recognition of his2 of
 xxxd2227xxx . in contrast, [ xxxg614xxx ]-gnrh ii and gnrh ii potencies were similar in the wild-type receptor (ec50 values,
0.44 nm and 0.19 nm) and in each of the mutant receptors,  xxxg241xxx .61(97)glu (ec50 values, 13 nm and 3.5 nm) and
 xxxg241xxx .61(97)ala (ec50 values, 33 nm and 34 nm). thus, the
 xxxg241xxx .61(97)glu mutation resulted in similar decreases in
the potency of both gnrh ii (17.3-fold) and [ xxxg614xxx ]-gnrh
ii (26-fold), which were smaller than the potency loss for
 xxxd2227xxx  (181-fold). the  xxxg241xxx .61(97)ala mutation caused
larger decreases in potency for both peptides, suggest-

ip production was measured in cos-1 cells transiently transfected with wild-type,  xxxg241xxx .61(97)glu, and  xxxg241xxx .61(97)ala type ii gnrh
receptors. data are the mean ⫾ se from duplicate determinations in three independent experiments.

carboxy terminally modified gnrh analogs at
the asn2.65(101)ala type ii  xxxg931xxx 
asn2.65(102) of the type i  xxxg931xxx  is thought to
interact with the c-terminal  xxxd149xxx  of  xxxd2227xxx  (20,
29). we compared the ip production at the wild-type
and asn2.65(101)ala type ii gnrh receptors stimulated
by gnrh ii and  xxxd2227xxx , which have the c-terminal
 xxxd149xxx  and analogs, [pro9nhet]-gnrh ii,
[pro9nhet]- xxxd2227xxx , which have an ethylamide c terminus and thus lack the  xxxd149xxx . the potencies of
[pro9nhet]-gnrh ii and [pro9nhet]- xxxd2227xxx  (ec50 values, 0.21 and 4.72 nm) were comparable with the
potencies of their parental peptides in the wild-type
receptor (ec50 values, 0.23 and 8.41 nm) (fig. 3 and
table 3), but showed much smaller decreases in potency at the asn2.65(101)ala mutant (4.33- and 61.8fold) than gnrh ii and  xxxd2227xxx  (133.5- and ⬎2076fold). this shows that the asn2.65(101) side chain is
required for recognizing the c-terminal  xxxd149xxx  of
gnrh ii and  xxxd2227xxx , as was found for the type i gnrh
receptor.

fig. 3. intracellular signaling of the asn2.65(101)ala type ii
 xxxg931xxx  stimulated by gnrh analogs with carboxyterminal modifications
cos-1 cells transfected with wild-type (a), or
asn2.65(101)ala (b) type ii gnrh receptors were stimulated
with gnrh ii (f), [pro9nhet]-gnrh ii (f), gnrh ii-oh (œ),
 xxxd2227xxx  (e), [pro9nhet]- xxxd2227xxx  (e), or  xxxd2227xxx -oh (‚) in the
presence of licl before ip extraction.

to determine whether the carbonyl (cao) or amine
(nh2) group of the  xxxd149xxx  is important, we tested
the potencies of analogs, gnrh ii-oh and  xxxd2227xxx -oh,
which have a free carboxyl terminus and thus have a
position 10 carbonyl group, but lack the amine group.
like gnrh ii and  xxxd2227xxx , gnrh ii-oh showed a large
potency decrease (⬎782-fold) at the asn2.65(101)ala mutant, whereas potency of  xxxd2227xxx -oh was too low to
measure. this indicates that the asn2.65(101) side chain of
the type ii  xxxg931xxx  contributes to recognition of
the carbonyl group at the c terminus of gnrh ii.
agonist and antagonist ligands at the
lys3.32(120)gln type ii  xxxg931xxx 
lys3.32(121) of the type i  xxxg931xxx  is required for
high-affinity binding of agonist peptides, but not for
antagonist activity (31). three agonists, gnrh ii, [his5
6
d-tyr ]- xxxd2227xxx , and  xxxd2227xxx  stimulated ip production
at the wild-type receptor with ec50 values of 0.26,
0.34, and 8.74 nm, respectively (fig. 4a and table 4),
but their potencies were decreased between 663- and
1937-fold at the lys3.32(120)gln mutant (fig. 4b and
table 4) and maximum ip production was lower, suggesting partial uncoupling of the receptor from ip production. this result shows that lys3.32(120) is required
for high agonist potency. antagonists 03 and 27 inhibited gnrh ii-stimulated ip production with ic50 values
of 216 and 6169 nm at the wild-type receptor (fig. 4c
and table 4). this low potency is not surprising because these synthetic peptides were developed for
type i gnrh receptors. the inhibition of gnrh iistimulated ip production by antagonists 03 and 27
was similar in the lys3.32(120)gln mutant (ic50s, 227 nm
and 1129 nm) (fig. 4d and table 4), showing that the
mutation does not affect interaction of peptide antagonists with the receptor and that the lys3.32(120) side
chain is not required for interaction with antagonist
ligands.

the type ii  xxxg931xxx , we designed and synthesized antagonists 239-26 and 239-27, which have the

showed low potency (212 ⫾ 61.9 nm and 146 ⫾ 44.4

indicating that they have low affinity for the receptor.
they had slightly lower potency at the lys3.32(120)gln
mutant (860 ⫾ 161 nm and 692 ⫾ 132 nm) (fig. 4f and
table 4).
molecular modeling
although it is clear from our experimental results that
the mutated residues are required for high-affinity
binding of gnrh ii, we used an independently constructed computational model of the receptor-ligand
complex to assess whether the specific interactions
proposed are feasible. gnrh ii was docked to a computational model of the marmoset type ii  xxxg931xxx , using contact sites identified for  xxxd2227xxx  binding to

the type i  xxxg931xxx  (gly10nh2 with asn2.65(101);
his2 with both  xxxg241xxx .61(97) and lys3.32(120) and pglu1
with asn5.39(204)). after energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation, the gnrh ii-type ii gnrh
receptor complex (fig. 5) showed a hydrogen bond
between the carbonyl of the c-terminal  xxxd149xxx  of
gnrh ii and the nh2 group of the asn2.65(101) side
chain. there was an intramolecular interaction of
 xxxg241xxx .61(97) with lys3.32(120), and the nh2 group of the
lys3.32(120) side chain formed a bond with the ionizable
␧-nitrogen of the his2 side chain of gnrh ii. however,
consistent with our experimental data, no interaction
between  xxxg241xxx .61(97) and his2 of gnrh ii was observed.
in summary, we have shown that the conserved
residues,  xxxg241xxx .61(97), asn2.65(101), and lys3.32(120) of
the type ii  xxxg931xxx  are important for binding
gnrh ii.  xxxg241xxx .61(97) contributes to recognition of his2

of  xxxd2227xxx , but not of gnrh ii. asn2.65(101) contributes
to recognition of the carbonyl group of the terminal
gly-nh2 of gnrh ii. lys3.32(120) is important for recognition of agonist, but not antagonist, ligands. consistent with these experimental data, a computational
model of the gnrh ii-type ii  xxxg931xxx  complex
showed interactions of the asn2.65(101) with the gly10nh2 of gnrh ii and lys3.32(120) with his2 of gnrh ii.
modifying residues in positions 1, 2, 3, and 10 of
gnrh ii yielded antagonists of the type ii  xxxg931xxx  that had low potency, suggesting that one or
more of these residues is critical for high-affinity interaction with the receptor.

gnrh ii was docked in the ␤-ii⬘ folded conformation to the

ii and the receptor contact residues lys3.32(120) and
asn2.65(101) (green) are clearly indicated. a receptor intramolecular interaction between  xxxg241xxx .61(97) and lys3.32(120) is also
displayed.

discussion
the stringent conservation of gnrh ii from bony fish
to man suggests it has an important function. some
progress has been made in demonstrating neuromodulatory effects and effects on reproductive behavior and energy status. however, a detailed investigation of its interaction with its receptor has not been
undertaken. we have started to define how gnrh ii
interacts with the recently cloned type ii  xxxg931xxx  by assessing whether conserved receptor residues
that are thought to interact with conserved residues of
 xxxd2227xxx  in the type i  xxxg931xxx  (13, 29–31) have
similar functions in type ii  xxxg931xxx  binding of
gnrh ii.
we have recreated, in the type ii  xxxg931xxx , the
mutations that were most informative in defining ligand binding interactions of the type i receptor (i.e.
mutations that showed measurable function that was
different from wild type) and tested their effects on
receptor responses to a range of modified ligands. the
severely decreased binding of gnrh ii by mutant receptors precluded quantification of binding affinity.
however, the demonstration that all mutants are expressed at levels the same as, or higher than wild type,
shows that they have decreased affinity for gnrh ii.
we used ligand-stimulated ip accumulation as a proxy
for ligand binding. the 10-fold difference between the
ic50 and ec50 values for gnrh ii at the wild-type
receptor suggests the presence of a receptor reserve.
hence decreases in gnrh ii potency at mutant receptors are potentially the product of decreased affinity
combined with decreased coupling efficiency/activation of the mutant receptor. indeed, the decreased
emax values for the  xxxg241xxx .61(97)ala and lys3.32(120)gln
mutants indicate that these two mutants are less efficiently activated than the wild-type receptor. decreased efficacies are expected when interactions that
underlie agonist activity are disrupted (33, 34). in the
absence of affinity information, effects of changes in
affinity and efficacy cannot be separated, but it is clear
that measured changes in ligand potency at mutant
receptors qualitatively reflect changes in affinity, al-

though they potentially overestimate the extent. we
have used modified ligands lacking the ability to interact with the wild-type receptor residues to support our
interpretations of receptor-ligand contacts. the demonstration that mutations have less effect on the potencies of these ligands is consistent with disruption of
fewer receptor-ligand interactions.
asn2.65 has similar functions in type i and type
ii gnrh receptors
asn2.65(102) of the type i  xxxg931xxx  is thought to
form a hydrogen bond interaction with the carboxyterminal  xxxd149xxx  of  xxxd2227xxx  (29). this interaction
was also predicted in our molecular model of the
gnrh ii-type ii  xxxg931xxx  complex, and our experiments support a similar function of asn2.65(101) of
the type ii  xxxg931xxx . introduction of ala, which
cannot hydrogen bond, decreased the potencies of
gnrh ii and  xxxd2227xxx , which both have the  xxxd149xxx ,
but had less effect on the potencies of [pro9nhet]gnrh ii and [pro9nhet]- xxxd2227xxx , which have an ethyl
moiety that cannot form hydrogen bonds. we interpret
that the smaller decrease in potency of ethylamide
peptides is because there is no disruption of an intermolecular hydrogen bond. these results show that, in
the wild-type complex, asn2.65(101) is required for recognition of peptides containing the  xxxd149xxx  and
support an interaction between asn2.65(101) and the
 xxxd149xxx .
the free acid peptide, gnrh ii-oh, which retains
the cao functional group of  xxxd149xxx , but lacks the
amine group, showed a large potency decrease at the
asn2.65(101)ala mutant. this indicates that the asn2.65(101)
side chain determines recognition of the carbonyl
group of the  xxxd149xxx . these experimental results
are consistent with the hydrogen bond between the
carbonyl group of gly10nh2 in gnrh ii and the amine
group of the asn2.65(101) side chain in the molecular
model (fig. 5). disruption of this interaction could account for part of the large decrease in potency of
gnrh ii at the asn2.65(101)ala mutant receptor,
whereas the balance of the potency loss may arise
from disruption of other receptor ligand interactions or
from decreased receptor activation.
lys3.32(120) of the type ii  xxxg931xxx  has a
conserved role in discriminating agonist and
antagonist peptides
lys3.32(121) of the type i  xxxg931xxx  is required for
binding of agonists but not antagonists (31). because
agonists differ from antagonists at the n terminus,
lys3.32(121) was proposed to interact with an aminoterminal residue of gnrh, and a hydrogen bond with
his2 was proposed (31). although this has been incorporated into models of  xxxd2227xxx  binding to the type i
 xxxg931xxx  (35, 36), other interactions have also
been proposed (37), and it remains uncertain whether
lys3.32(121) interacts with any amino-terminal func-

tional group of gnrh or stabilizes a high-affinity receptor conformation. in the present study, mutation of
lys3.32(120) led to large decreases in agonist potencies,
whereas the ic50 values for antagonists 03 and 27
were unaffected. this shows that lys3.32(120) of the
type ii  xxxg931xxx  is required for the high potency
of agonists, but has no effect on antagonist activity.
consistent with a previous report (38), both antagonists had low potency at the type ii  xxxg931xxx .
we hypothesized that the low potency was due to the
presence of  xxxd2227xxx  residues in positions 5, 7, and 8,
and designed antagonists 239-26 and 239-27 to increase affinity for the type ii  xxxg931xxx . the low
potencies of these antagonists and of a series of
gnrh ii antagonists based on the type i receptor
antagonist,  xxxd466xxx  (21), indicate that the peptides
have low affinity for the receptor. this suggests that
one or more of the substitutions in positions 1, 2, 3,
and 10 severely disrupts binding of the peptides to the
type ii  xxxg931xxx  and that a more detailed structure-activity analysis is needed to generate potent,
high-affinity antagonists specific for the type ii gnrh
receptor.
 xxxg241xxx .61(97) of the type ii  xxxg931xxx 
recognizes his2 of  xxxd2227xxx  but not gnrh ii
the  xxxg241xxx .61(98) side chain of the type i  xxxg931xxx 
is thought to form a hydrogen bond with his2 of gnrh
i (30). if his2 of gnrh ii interacts with  xxxg241xxx .61(97) of the
type ii  xxxg931xxx , it is expected that the potency
losses of peptides with substitutions at position 2 will
be smaller, compared with peptides with his2, when
 xxxg241xxx .61(97) is mutated to glu or ala. this was the case
when [ xxxg614xxx ]- xxxd2227xxx  and  xxxd2227xxx  were compared at the
 xxxg241xxx .61(97)glu mutant, but gnrh ii and [ xxxg614xxx ]-gnrh ii
exhibited similar potency losses at the  xxxg241xxx .61(97)glu
and  xxxg241xxx .61(97)ala mutants. this shows that the determinant for the potency loss was a common feature
between gnrh ii and [ xxxg614xxx ]-gnrh ii and therefore
independent of his2. this suggests either that  xxxg614xxx  can
substitute for his2, or that  xxxg241xxx .61(97) of the type ii
 xxxg931xxx  does not interact with his2 of gnrh ii.
consistent with the latter, gnrh ii showed a smaller
potency loss than  xxxd2227xxx  (17.9-fold compared with
181-fold) at the  xxxg241xxx .61(97)glu mutant, suggesting that
fewer intermolecular contacts were disrupted.
these findings show that mutation of  xxxg241xxx .61 has
distinct effects on ligand-stimulated signaling in type i
and type ii gnrh receptors. using ligand potency as a
proxy for ligand affinity, this leads to the conclusion
that the interactions between the conserved type ii
 xxxg931xxx  residues and gnrh ii differ somewhat
from those between the equivalent residues in the type
i  xxxg931xxx  and  xxxd2227xxx . furthermore, the interaction of gnrh ii with the type ii  xxxg931xxx  differs
from the interaction of  xxxd2227xxx  with the same receptor.

3 -transmembrane helix 7 region of the type ii gnrh
receptor increased affinity for  xxxd2227xxx , but had no

effect on gnrh ii (23), supports our conclusion that
 xxxd2227xxx  and gnrh ii have partially distinct, although
overlapping, binding surfaces on the type ii  xxxg931xxx . there is also evidence to suggest that ligand
binding surfaces for  xxxd2227xxx  and gnrh ii differ in the type
i  xxxg931xxx , because mutations remote from the
ligand binding site enhanced affinity for gnrh ii, but not
for  xxxd2227xxx  (36), and mutation of extracellular loop 3
decreased affinity for  xxxd2227xxx , but not gnrh ii (39).
although the complexity of peptide ligands makes it
difficult to fully define ligand contact surfaces of peptide
receptors, there is precedent for distinct ligand binding
interactions of other closely related peptide receptors. in
the nk1,  xxxg2240xxx , and nk3 tachykinin receptors, distinct
residues are important for recognition of the three related
peptides,  xxxg2240xxx ,  xxxg2240xxx  and  xxxg2241xxx 
(26, 40–44), whereas distinct regions of the ␮-, ␬-, and
␦-opioid receptors determine subtype selectivity of these
receptors (45), and it has been concluded that every
ligand of the ␦-opioid receptor has a “distinct binding
fingerprint” (46).
to summarize, we have shown that amino acid residues that are important for ligand binding in the type
i  xxxg931xxx , and conserved in the type ii gnrh
receptor, are important for ligand binding in the type ii
 xxxg931xxx . as in the type i receptor, asn2.65(101) is
important for recognizing the carboxy-terminal cao
functional group and lys3.32(120) is important for responses to agonists, but not antagonists. although we
show that  xxxg241xxx .61(97) contributes to gnrh ii binding, it
does not contribute to recognition of the his2 side
chain. combined with the molecular model, ligand
binding and ligand-stimulated signaling results lead to
the conclusion that the ligand binding interactions of
the two gnrh receptors are broadly similar, but that
conservation of amino acids between receptors and
ligands does not necessarily lead to conservation of
contacts between them. defining the similarities and
differences between the type i and type ii gnrh receptors is useful in understanding how both receptors
interact with and respond to their ligands.

receptor amino acid residue numbering
a consensus amino acid residue numbering scheme (47) has
been used to identify equivalent amino acid residues in different g protein-coupled receptors. the amino acid name is
followed by an identifier consisting of the transmembrane
segment number and the position of that residue relative to
the most conserved residue in that segment, which is assigned the number 50, and sequence number in parentheses.
for example, asp97 of the type ii  xxxg931xxx  is designated  xxxg241xxx .61(97) because it is 11 residues c-terminal of the
most conserved residue of the tms 2,  xxxg241xxx .50(86). the equivalent residue of the type i  xxxg931xxx  is  xxxg241xxx .61(98). mutant receptors are identified by the wild-type residue followed
by the replacement residue, e.g.  xxxg241xxx .61(97)glu has a glu
substitution for  xxxg241xxx .61(97).
receptor constructs
mutations were based on the most informative mutations
previously done in the type i  xxxg931xxx  (29–31). the
mutations,  xxxg241xxx .61(97)glu,  xxxg241xxx .61(97)ala, asn2.65(101)ala, and
lys3.32(120)gln were introduced into the cdna of the wild-type
marmoset type ii  xxxg931xxx , using pcr-based sitedirected mutagenesis. pcr primers contained the required
mutant codons and silent restriction enzyme sites to allow
identification of mutant receptors by restriction analysis. mutant receptors were subcloned into the pcdna3.1(⫹) expression vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). the wild-type and
mutant receptor constructs were also subcloned into the
pflag-cmv-2 (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) epitopetagged expression vector to assess receptor expression by
immunoblotting. dna was prepared using the nucleobond
dna purification kit (macherey-nagel, duren, germany). sequences of all mutant receptor constructs were confirmed by
automated sequencing.
cell culture and transfection
cos-1 cells were maintained in dmem (invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (delta bioproducts, kempton park,
south africa) in a 10% carbon dioxide atmosphere and
seeded onto 12-well plates (2 ⫻ 105 cells per well). cells were
transfected using a modification of the diethylaminoethyldextran method as previously described (48, 49).
ip assays
ligand-stimulated production of ip was assessed as previously described (48). cells were labeled 2 d after transfection
for 20 h in 0.5 ml medium 199 (invitrogen ltd., paisley,
scotland, uk) containing 2% fcs and 2 ␮ci/ml myo-[23
h]inositol (amersham biosciences). cells were treated with
various concentrations of peptides for 1 h at 37 c in buffer
(140 mm nacl; 20 mm hepes; 4 mm kcl; 8 mm glucose; 1 mm
mgcl2; 1 mm cacl2; 1 mg/ml bsa, ph 7.4) containing 10 mm
licl. ip was extracted with 10 mm  xxxd2154xxx  for at least 30
min at 4 c, separated on dowex ion exchange columns, and
counted by scintillation counting. every experiment included
the wild-type receptor stimulated with gnrh ii as a reference
curve to control for any variation in transfection efficiency.
insofar as emax in ip assays reflects receptor expression, the
emax of mutant receptors relative to wild type was consistent
and reproducible (table 1). it can be seen from the raw data
presented in figs. 2 and 4 that mutant receptor emax (% wild
type) was constant throughout the study, although counts
per min values varied among experiments. from this we
believe that relative expression of wild-type and mutant receptors was constant in all experiments.

ligand binding assays
gnrh ii was radioiodinated by a variation of the chloramine-t
method as previously described for 125i-[his5,d-tyr6]-gnrh
(32). transfected cos-1 cells were incubated with 125i-gnrh
ii (100 000 cpm/well) and varying concentrations of unlabeled
gnrh ii in a volume of 0.5 ml hepes-buffered dmem for 16 h
at 4 c. cells were washed twice with ice-cold pbs, and
bound radioactivity was collected in 1 m naoh and counted
by ␥ counting.
quantitative immunoblotting
membranes were prepared from transfected cos-1 cells,
solubilized in 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1propanesulfonate, electrophoresed, and blotted as previously described (50). blots were blocked with 5% milk powder in tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight with the
anti-flag m2 antibody (sigma-aldrich corp.). horseradish
peroxidase-linked antimouse igg was used as secondary
antibody and detected using the ecl plus western blotting
kit (amersham, arlington heights, il). the alphaeasefc analysis software (alpha innotech corp. san leandro, ca) was
used for quantification.
molecular modeling
a model of the marmoset type ii  xxxg931xxx  was built by
comparative modeling through modeller as described
previously for the human  xxxg931xxx  (36) and the m1
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (51), by using the 2.8 å
x-ray crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin as a template (52)
(root mean square deviation, 1.25 å for 296 c␣-atoms). the
model omitted 18 amino acids in the middle of the intracellular loop 3 (arg236-asp253) and the last 44 amino acids in the
c-terminal tail. a ␤-ii⬘ conformation of gnrh ii was first
docked manually into the putative conserved binding sites of
the marmoset type ii  xxxg931xxx  derived from the human
 xxxg931xxx  binding sites of  xxxd2227xxx  (i.e. pglu1 with
asn5.39(204), his2 with  xxxg241xxx .61(97)/lys3.32(120), and gly10nh2
with asn2.65(101)) (13), by using the swiss-pdbviewer (version
3.7 sp5, http://www.expasy.org/spdbv/). the gnrh ii manually docked to the marmoset type ii  xxxg931xxx  model
was then subjected to in vacuo energy minimization and
molecular dynamics simulations by means of the charmm
program (53) using a setup similar to that described by fanelli
and colleagues (54, 55).
data analysis
competition binding assays, immunoblotting, and ip assays
were performed in duplicate in at least three independent
experiments. ic50 and ec50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression using prism graphing software (graphpad,
san diego, ca). statistical analysis of immunoblot results
was performed using a two-tailed student’s t test.
