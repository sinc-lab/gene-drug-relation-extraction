abstract
background: the aim of the present study was to describe the activity of a set of opioid drugs,
including partial agonists, in a cell system expressing only µ opioid receptors. receptor activation
was assessed by measuring the inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated cyclic adenosine mono phosphate
(camp) production. efficacies and potencies of these ligands were determined relative to the
endogenous ligand  xxxg1801xxx  and the common µ agonist, morphine.
results: among the ligands studied naltrexone, win 44,441 and skf 10047, were classified as
antagonists, while the remaining ligands were agonists. agonist efficacy was assessed by determining
the extent of inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production. the rank order of efficacy of the
agonists was fentanyl = hydromorphone =  xxxg1801xxx  >  xxxd2070xxx  = lofentanil = butorphanol =
morphine = nalbuphine = nalorphine > cyclazocine =  xxxd1864xxx  = metazocine ≥ xorphanol. the rank
order of potency of these ligands was different from that of their efficacies;  xxxd2070xxx  >
hydromorphone >  xxxd1864xxx  > xorphanol = nalorphine = butorphanol = lofentanil > metazocine >
nalbuphine > cyclazocine > fentanyl > morphine >>>>  xxxg1801xxx .
conclusion: these results elucidate the relative activities of a set of opioid ligands at µ opioid
receptor and can serve as the initial step in a systematic study leading to understanding of the mode
of action of opioid ligands at this receptor. furthermore, these results can assist in understanding
the physiological effect of many opioid ligands acting through µ opioid receptors.

background
opioid ligands exhibit a variety of physiological activities
and have been utilized extensively in medicine, most
prominently in the treatment of pain. however, at analgesic doses, opioid receptor agonists or partial agonists can
induce unwanted side effects such as ventilatory depression [1,2] and the development of physical tolerance and
dependence [3,4]. thus, the search for opioid ligands
which possess analgesic effect and lack untoward effects
has been a sought after goal of the medical community.

the overall hypothesis that drives the present work is that
the ideal opioid analgesics that exhibit minimal side effects might be drugs that bind to more than one opioid receptor, but differentially activate each of the opioid
receptor types (µ, delta, kappa). such drugs would potentially act
as a full agonist at a specific opioid receptor type, while
acting as partial agonists or antagonists at the other receptor types. for example some investigators have suggested
that opioid ligands with agonism at µ opioid receptors
and antagonism at delta opioid receptors are potentially use-

ful analgesics [5–7]. in cases where the medicinal effect of
a drug is mediated through the same opioid receptor type
that also elicits the side effects, the use of drugs with
mixed activity could be most beneficial [7]. in such a case,
interaction with one receptor could reverse the unwanted
side effects associated with activation of the other receptor. in order to test this hypothesis, the activation profiles
of a set of non-selective opioid ligands need to be assessed
in vitro, followed by in vivo evaluation of analgesic and unwanted effects. the completed data set can be used to determine the characteristics of ligands possessing analgesia
in the absence of unwanted effects. one of the steps in
such an approach is presented here.
in order to clearly understand the activity of any ligand for
mechanistic characterization or rational drug design, it is
essential that the ligands be tested in a well-defined environment under identical experimental conditions. moreover, the use of a transfected cell system in which a single
receptor type is expressed is critical for these types of modelling. such tools were not available until recently when
the three opioid receptor types were cloned. we have previously characterized these ligands in cells expressing only
 xxxg1632xxx  [8]. the present study was devised to
characterize the activity of a set of opioid ligands in a cell
line expressing only µ opioid receptors. the ligands selected were chosen based on our previous data suggesting that
they bind to all three opioid receptor types [9]. previous
model tissue data [10] and in vivo data [11] had suggested
that some of these drugs displayed differential activation
profiles at each of the opioid receptor types. thus, the
present study was designed to achieve the following goals;
(1) to describe the activation profiles of a set of opioid ligands not previously defined in an isolated cell system expressing only µ opioid receptor, and (2) to compare the
efficacies of these drugs to the known, highly efficacious µ
receptor agonist, fentanyl, the common opioid analgesic
morphine and to the endogenous opioid ligand  xxxg1801xxx .
in the present study, we employed an hek cell line stably
expressing µ opioid receptors (hek-µ) to characterize the
activation and binding profiles of fifteen opioid ligands.
these cells do not express endogenous µ opioid receptors
and are easily transfected. furthermore, they have previously been used to study opioid receptor activation [12–
16] by measuring inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
camp production. the results obtained from this study
can serve to clarify the categorization of each of the ligands studied as an agonist, weak/partial agonist or antagonist at µ opioid receptors. moreover, these results
demonstrate that it is crucial to understand the interaction
of each drug with a single receptor type at the molecular
level in order to fully appreciate the mode of action of the
drug in the body.

results
activation assays
our results clearly characterize the ligands studied as agonists or antagonists at µ opioid receptors with respect to
inhibition of adenyly cyclase. naltrexone, skf 10047 and
win 44,441 were identified as antagonists. these ligands
exhibited little or no measurable inhibitory effect on  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production when used alone and
were repeatedly able to block the inhibitory effect of 1 nm
 xxxd2070xxx . all other ligands studied showed agonism at µ
opioid receptor with varying maximal effects or efficacies
ranging from 29% – 71% (table 1). the rank order of efficacy of the ligands tested were fentanyl = hydromorphone =  xxxg1801xxx  >  xxxd2070xxx  = lofentanil =
butorphanol = morphine= nalbuphine = nalorphine > cyclazocine =  xxxd1864xxx  = metazocine ≥ xorphanol. the ic50
of all ligands studied were between 1–10 nm, with the exception of  xxxd2070xxx , which was the most potent drug,
with an ic50 of 0.3 nm, morphine, which was the least
potent drug with an ic50 of 12 nm and the endogenous
ligand  xxxg1801xxx  with ic50 of 500 nm. a low affinity is
acceptable for an endogenous ligand that is released at
very high concentrations at the site of action at the synaptic cleft. the rank order of potency of the drugs studied
were;  xxxd2070xxx  > hydromorphone >  xxxd1864xxx  > xorphanol = nalorphine = butorphanol = lofentanil > metazocine
> nalbuphine > cyclazocine > fentanyl > morphine >>>>
 xxxg1801xxx . as can be seen, the rank order of efficacy was
not related to the rank order of potency. in fact one of the
most potent ligands, xorphanol, was the least efficacious.

statistical analysis of the differences between the efficacies
of different ligands was carried out to distinguish the full
agonists from the partial agonists. based on these analyses, there was no difference in the efficacy of butorphanol,
 xxxd2070xxx , lofentanil or nalorphine compared to fentanyl
or hydromorphone (p > 0.05). however, morphine and
nalbuphine both had efficacies that were less than fentanyl (p < 0.05). both fentanyl and hydromorphone
showed maximal efficacies that were not significantly different compared to that of the endogenous ligand  xxxg1801xxx  (p > 0.05), thus categorizing them as full agonists
compared to  xxxg1801xxx . finally the four weakest agonists, cyclazocine,  xxxd1864xxx , metazocine and xorphanol
all exhibited efficacies that showed statistically significant
difference when compared to fentanyl (p < 0.01), and
thus were categorized as partial agonists.
figure 1 represents the dose response curves of three agonists and one antagonist. the least efficacious (xorphanol,
fig 1a) and most efficacious (fentanyl, fig 1b) ligands are
shown for comparison. the dose response curve of nalbuphine that was previously described as an antagonist at µ
opioid receptor is also shown (fig 1c) in order to demonstrate the robustness of its agonistic effect at µ opioid re-

binding assays
a single clone of transfected hek cells stably expressing
approximately 3 pmoles of µ opioid receptors per mg of
protein, as measured by [3h]-damgo binding, was propagated and used as a model for characterization of the
binding profiles of a set of opioid ligands at µ opioid receptors. this level of expression is not uncommon for
transfected cell systems [17,18], although such receptor
expression levels may appear higher than reported values
from brain tissues. the measured values from specific
brain regions are average estimates over an entire tissue or

region and not that of a single cell and the actual expression on a single cell in the brain is most likely much higher. furthermore, these high levels of receptor expression
have been measured in cell lines that were established
from various neuronal tissues. for example, similar levels
of expression have been measured for neuronal cells in
culture (sh-sy5y cells) [19] or primary cultures of dorsal
root ganglion sensory neurons [20]. thus, the level of µ receptor expression in the cell line used in this study is comparable to that of cells expressing the µ opioid receptors in
various regions of the nervous system. competition binding studies were carried out for the ligands that were
shown to act as antagonists or weak/partial agonists at µ
opioid receptors to confirm that these agents were in fact
capable of binding to µ opioid receptors with high affini-

ty. competition binding studies indicated that the antagonists naltrexone, skf 10047 and win 44,441 had
binding affinities (ki) in nanomolar range and the two
weakest agonists, xorphanol and cyclazocine bound the
receptor with the highest affinities. the rank order of affinities was determined to be; cyclazocine = xorphanol >
win 44,441 > naltrexone > skf 10047 > morphine. this
order was in agreement with the relative potencies of these
drugs, showing that cyclazocine and xorphanol had higher affinities and potencies compared to morphine, although they were both less efficacious than morphine.

discussion
a well-defined receptor expression system was used to
characterize the activation profiles of a set of opioid ligands and to compare the efficacies and potencies of these
ligands at µ opioid receptors. the main advantage of using
transfected hek cells for this study is that these cells do
not contain endogenous µ opioid receptors, but express
the g proteins necessary for the proper coupling of the
transfected genes to the respective second messenger systems. a well established method for assessing g-protein
activation by opioid receptors and characterizing activity
of opioid ligands is measuring the extent of inhibition of

 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl cyclase (ac) activity [12–
14,21–23]. adenylyl cyclase has been implicated in playing a role in mediating the analgesic effect of opioid ligands through µ opioid receptors [24–28]. thus,
characterizing the ability of opioid ligands to inhibit
camp production, such as described in this report, could
be used as an index for assessing their activity as a correlate of their analgesic effects. moreover, a simple well-defined system, such as the one used in this study, can be
very beneficial in describing the mode of action of each
ligand at a specific receptor. however, it is understood
that once applied to the whole animal in vivo, the overall
effect of the drug will be a composite of the effects of the
drug on all receptor types interacting with it. furthermore,
the pharmacokinetic parameters, such as metabolism, tissue absorption and distribution of the drug will play a
major role in the overall drug effect in vivo.
the present set of ligands exhibited a range of efficacies
and potencies. the most efficacious drug was fentanyl,
supporting previous in vivo studies describing fentanyl as
a highly potent and efficacious analgesic drug [11]. on the
other hand xorphanol was identified as a highly potent
ligand with the lowest efficacy in inhibiting camp production through µ opioid receptors. clinically, xorphanol is a
well tolerated, orally active analgesic that provides effective pain relief but shows low physical dependence liability [29,30]. it is possible that the low physical dependence
liability of this drug is due to its partial agonism at µ opioid receptors.
the present study can offer some explanation for the existing in vivo data by providing information on the relative
coupling efficacies of the tested ligands from a controlled
system. for example, one study characterizing butorphanol, [31] described this drug as a mild analgesic compared
to morphine. however, in another study, butorphanol
was reported to be equipotent in its antinociceptive effect
to that of morphine [32]. in our assays, we have observed
that butorphanol and morphine are equally efficacious in
inhibiting camp production, although butorphanol is
more potent than morphine in this assay. based on these
two sets of results, if the analgesic effect of butorphanol is
mediated via µ opioid receptors through the inhibitory effect of these receptors on adenylyl cyclase, the equal efficacy of morphine and butorphanol would support an
equal antinociceptive effect of these two drugs. thus, such
results demonstrate that it is essential to describe the effect
of ligands on specific receptor types in order to fully define the mode of action of each drug.
our data clearly show that nalbuphine is a potent agonist
at the µ opioid receptor with an efficacy similar to that of
morphine, thus agreeing with in vivo data showing that
morphine and nalbuphine are equally potent as analge-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/3/1

sics [33]. however, other reports have described nalbuphine as a "mixed agonist/antagonist" with agonism at kappa
opioid receptors and antagonism at µ opioid receptors
based on in vivo data [11,33]. this categorization is likely
due to the fact that nalbuphine has been shown to reduce
the ventilatory depressant effect of other opioids, while
adding to their analgesic effect [33]. nalbuphine is also
used clinically to reduce the opioid-mediated side effects
such as itching, without completely reversing the analgesic effects of the full agonists [34–36]. according to our
data, although nalbuphine is clearly a potent agonist at µ
receptors, its levels of agonism is significantly lower than
the very efficacious drug fentanyl and the endogenous ligand  xxxg1801xxx . therefore, if combined with a drug such
as fentanyl, or in the presence of an internal pool of  xxxg1801xxx , nalbuphine can act as an antagonist in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase by µ opioid receptors. thus, the net
effect of the mixture of the two ligands at the level of the
whole animal will be the combined effect. this can explain the usefulness of drugs such as nalbuphine in reducing the side effects associated with the more potent opioid
analgesics while not totally reversing the analgesic action
of those ligands.
comparing the efficacies of the ligands in this study to the
endogenous ligand  xxxg1801xxx  indicates that fentanyl,
 xxxd2070xxx , lofentanil, butorphanol and hydromorphone
are all full agonists. thus in physiological pathways where
inhibition of adenylyl cyclase mediates the activity of µ
opioid receptors, these drugs will act as agonists at µ opioid receptors. other ligands with efficacies significantly
different from that of  xxxg1801xxx , can act as agonists
with different efficacies at µ opioid receptors when administered alone. however, in the presence of the endogenous ligand  xxxg1801xxx  (when released at the synapse)
or another full agonist, a weaker agonist can potentially
act as a competitive antagonist. conversely, it is possible
for ligands categorized and accepted as antagonists to act
as agonists at µ opioid receptor, if applied alone at high
enough concentrations, albeit with a very low efficacy.
this does not mean that when applied to the whole organism, an analgesic effect of such a drug will be observed.
the reason is that the affinity, efficacy, dose and pharmacokinetic properties of the drug used will influence the ultimate effect seen in the organism, as will the presence of
other ligands in the system. when drugs are used in combination, the net effect will depend on the intrinsic characteristics (efficacy and affinity) of the two drugs relative
to each other and their relative concentrations at the site
of action. consequently, it is important to have a clear understanding of the characteristics of each drug and the molecular changes that occur at the receptor following
receptor-drug interaction [37]. such knowledge will allow
one to target a specific receptor population with the aim
of attaining a certain physiological effect; possibly by mix-

ing two or more drugs or using a single drug that possesses
different activation profiles at various receptors.

conclusion
in summary, this is the first detailed comparative report of
the inhibitory effect of a set of opioid ligands on the accumulation of camp in intact cells expressing µ opioid receptors. the activation profiles of these ligands have been
compared to that of the endogenous opioid ligand,  xxxg1801xxx , and the commonly used opioid analgesics, morphine and fentanyl. moreover, this report serves to clarify
the activation profiles of many previously uncharacterised
ligands in cells expressing only µ opioid receptors, thus
leading to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of these drugs.

method
cell culture
human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells were maintained in d-mem/f-12 (dulbecco's modified eagle's medium: nutrient mixture f-12 1:1 mixture), supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (fcs), 200 µg/ml  xxxd2191xxx 
( xxxd2191xxx ®) in a humidified incubator with 5% co2 and
95% air, at 37°c. the incubation medium was changed
every 3–4 days. once a week, cells were re-plated at 20%
density into 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks.
establishing stable cells expressing µ opioid receptors
stably transfected hek cells were developed as described
previously [12]. hek 293 cells were transfected with
mouse µ opioid receptor cdna in the pcdna3 vector (a
generous gift from drs. chris evans and duane keith,
ucla) using the lipofectin® reagent (life technologies,
rockville, md). one clone with a bmax of 3326 ± 674
fmoles/mg of protein as assessed by [3h]-damgo binding was propagated for use in this study.
binding assays
saturation binding assays were carried out for [3h]-damgo in hek cells as described previously [38]. each assay
was carried out in triplicates in a 250 µl total reaction volume containing 20–25 µg of crude cell homogenate per
assay tube. incubation was in 50 mm tris hcl buffer, ph
7.4 at room temperature for 2 hours. the assay was terminated by rapid filtration through whatman gf/b filters
followed by three washes, with ice-cold buffer. radioactivity retained on the filters was measured using liquid
scintillation counting.

competition binding assays were carried out in crude homogenate of hek-µ cells. binding was carried out in 250
µl volume of 50 mm tris hcl buffer, ph 7.4 in the presence of about 0.5–1 nm [3h]-damgo and increasing
concentrations (24–32) of unlabeled ligand. incubation
and washing were as described above. binding data were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/3/1

analyzed using the affinity analysis software as described
before [38]. for preparation of crude cell homogenate,
confluent cultures of hek-µ cells were harvested using
phosphate buffered saline. following centrifugation, the
cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 50 mm tris hcl
buffer ph 7.4 at about 107cell/ml, and homogenized using a polytron at setting 6 for 10 seconds. the cell homogenate was stored in aliquots at -86°c until use.
protein content of the cell homogenate was determined
using bio-rad protein assay reagent (bio-rad, hercules,
ca).
whole cell adenylyl cyclase assays
exponentially growing hek-µ cells were harvested and resuspended in serum free dmem/f12 medium. cells were
plated in 96 well micro titer plates at 5 × 104 cells/well. to
each well, phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1methylxanthine ( xxxd2388xxx ) was added to a final concentration of 100 µm, followed by addition of agonists at different concentrations and incubation at 37°c. following
incubation for 15 minutes,  xxxd1742xxx  was added to each
well to a final concentration of 5 µm followed by another
incubation for 15 minutes at 37°c. the reaction was terminated by aspiration of the medium and addition of
lysis buffer from the biotrak™ camp enzyme immunoassay kit from amersham pharmacia biotech (buckinghamshire, england). the rest of the assay followed the
protocol provided with the kit. actual amount of camp
was determined for each sample in comparison to a standard curve of known amounts of camp provided in the
camp kit, as described in the kit protocol.
agonism
agonistic activity of opioid ligands was assessed by measuring the inhibitory effect of the drugs on  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accumulation. data were normalized to the
top of the curve (no drug, 100%), expressed as percent inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accumulation and
were fitted to a sigmoidal function by using one site competition function as described below. the efficacy of each
ligand was defined as percent inhibition of forskolinstimulated camp production compared to no drug levels
(0% inhibition, 100% camp production).
antagonism
compounds with no or very small in vitro agonistic activity (<20% inhibition of camp production) for which the
dose response curves could not be fitted due to the small
effect, were tested for antagonism. antagonists were defined as ligands that were able to repeatedly block the inhibitory effect of 1 nm  xxxd2070xxx  on  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
camp production. antagonist was added to the cells along
with  xxxd2388xxx . after 15 minutes of incubation, the agonist
was added and the cells were incubated with both drugs

for an additional 10 minutes. the rest of the assay was as
described above.
curve fitting
the analysis of drug activity was performed using prism
software (graphpad software, inc. san diego, ca). a
computer-generated "best fit" of non-linear regression
data was used to provide an estimate of the inhibitory
concentration at 50% (ic50). dose response data generated by camp enzyme immunoassay (eia) system were fitted to the one site competition function.

pharmaceutical division (west haven, ct). all tissue culture reagents were purchased from life technologies
(rockville, md). damgo was obtained from peninsula
laboratories (san carlos, ca), and [3h]-damgo was
from multiple peptide systems (san diego, ca). all other
reagents were of analytical grade from standard commercial sources. all ligands used were prepared as 10 mm
stock solutions in water except win 44,441, which was 5
mm. all ligands were dissolved in distilled water except
cyclazocine,  xxxd1864xxx ,  xxxd2070xxx , which were dissolved in
100% ethanol. for the drugs dissolved in ethanol, the final concentration of ethanol was <0.01% which had no
affect on the assays performed.

the authors wish to thank drs. m. frances davies and timothy m. delorey
for valuable discussions, ms. aoife keohane for preliminary work that led
to this publication and drs. evans and keith for the cdna for mouse µ opioid receptor. this work was supported by nih grant da12539.

statistical analysis
maximal inhibitory effect of each ligand was compared to
the levels of maximal inhibition by  xxxg1801xxx , fentanyl, morphine and xorphanol using anova analysis with
dunnett's multiple comparison as post-test using prism
software (graphpad software, inc. san diego, ca). significant difference between the inhibitory effects of two ligands was determined whenever p < 0.05.
