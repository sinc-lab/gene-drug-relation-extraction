between pyridoxaldimine and pyridoxamine forms by means of two
coupled half-reactions (2, 3). the half-reaction converting ketoglutarate
to glutamate is the same for both enzymes as well as for the majority of
other aminotransferases. in this half-reaction, the chemical changes
occur at the ␣-carbon. the substrate specificity of the enzymes thus
arises from the other half-reaction that transfers an amino group distant
from the ␣-carbon. for this reason, the enzymes are known as “␻-aminotransferases” (4). in the case of  xxxg8xxx , the amino group transferred is the only amino group in the substrate molecule, whereas
orn-at specifically selects the ␻-amino group of ornithine despite the
presence of a second amino group on c␣ with the same configuration as
that in glutamate (3).
the three-dimensional structures of both enzymes have been solved
in the unliganded form as well as in complex with various substrate
analogues (5–7). the enzymes have the same basic fold as the best
studied member of the largest family of plp-dependent enzymes,
namely aspartate aminotransferase (8). the root mean square deviation
of c␣ positions in orn-at and  xxxg8xxx  is relatively large at 2.1 å,
and the enzymes have only 17% sequence identity (6). nevertheless, the
arrangements of residues at the active sites of the two enzymes are
strikingly similar (fig. 2). all of the direct contacts between cofactor and
enzyme protein are conserved. sterically, there are only two significant
differences in the active site regions. one is a straightforward substitution in which tyr-85 in orn-at is replaced by isoleucine in  xxxg8xxx .4
the other is an exchange of tyr-55 in orn-at for phe-351* in gabaat.5 despite arising from completely different parts of the molecule,
the c⑀ atoms of the aromatic rings of these last named residues occupy
the same steric position, but the planes of their aromatic rings are perpendicular to each other. the necessary space for the aromatic ring of
tyr-55 in orn-at exists because residue 351 is glycine. conversely,
space for the phe-351* aromatic ring is available because the homologue
of residue 55 in  xxxg8xxx  is alanine. one of the aims of this study was
to determine the extent to which orn-at can be converted to
 xxxg8xxx  by mutating the relevant residues together as well as
individually.
a further aim of the study was to test a hypothesis advanced to
explain the ability of these enzymes to act at ␻- and ␣-amino groups
in alternate half-reactions (5). we addressed this particular aspect of
specificity in the case of orn-at because ornithine has both an ␣and an ␻-amino group. the “glu-235 switch” hypothesis was
inspired by the observation that, uniquely in orn-at and gabaat, a conserved arginine (arg-413) is engaged in tight h-bond/salt
bridge interactions with the side chain carboxylate of glu-235 (5).
this arginine is one of only four residues that are conserved in all the
aminotransferases from the same family (9). the crystal structure of

 xxxg1621xxx  and  xxxg8xxx  are related  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzymes having
different substrate specificities. the atomic structures of these
enzymes have shown (i) that active site differences are limited to the
steric positions occupied by two tyrosine residues in  xxxg1621xxx  and (ii) that, uniquely among related, structurally
characterized aminotransferases, the conserved arginine that binds
the ␣-carboxylate of ␣-amino acids interacts tightly with a glutamate residue. to determine the contribution of these residues to the
specificities of the enzymes, we analyzed site-directed mutants of
 xxxg1621xxx  by rapid reaction kinetics, x-ray crystallography, and 13c nmr spectroscopy. mutation of one tyrosine
(tyr-85) to isoleucine, as found in aminobutyrate aminotransferase,
decreased the rate of the reaction of the enzyme with ornithine
1000-fold and increased that with  xxxd2177xxx  16-fold, indicating that tyr-85 is a major determinant of specificity toward ornithine. unexpectedly, the limiting rate of the second half of the reaction, conversion of ketoglutarate to glutamate, was greatly
increased, although the kinetics of the reverse reaction were unaffected. a mutant in which the glutamate (glu-235) that interacts
with the conserved arginine was replaced by alanine retained its
regiospecificity for the ␦-amino group of ornithine, but the glutamate reaction was enhanced 650-fold, whereas only a 5-fold
enhancement of the ketoglutarate reaction rate resulted. a model is
proposed in which conversion of the enzyme to its pyridoxamine
phosphate form disrupts the internal glutamate-arginine interaction, thus enabling ketoglutarate but not glutamate to be a good
substrate.

orn-at bound to an ornithine analogue shows that arg-413
remains masked by glu-235 and that the ␣-carboxylate of ornithine
is bound by arg-180 with the non-reacting ␣-amino group held
between the oh groups of tyr-55 and tyr-85 (5). these observations led to the proposal that the interaction between glu-235 and
arg-413 is important in preventing binding of ornithine in an orientation that would lead to transamination of the ␣-amino group of
this substrate. it was further proposed that in the second half-reaction, glu-235 switches its position and uncovers arg-413 so that
ketoglutarate and glutamate can bind productively through their
respective ␣-carboxylate groups (5). to assess the contribution of
the proposed glu-235 switch in determining orn-at substrate
specificity, we produced orn-at e235s and e235a mutants and
analyzed their kinetic properties.

deuterium exchange experiments—ornithine (0.5 ml, 30 mm) dissolved in d2o was added to wild-type or mutant enzyme (0.1 ml in d2o)
and maintained at 25 °c for a chosen time. after separation of protein
using a centricon ym-50 centrifugal concentrator, the nmr spectra of
the ornithine were determined at 20 °c in 5-mm-diameter tubes on a
bruker amx360 spectrometer operating at 360 mhz for 1h and 90
mhz for 13c. the 13c spectra were recorded with broadband 1h
decoupling.
crystallography—crystals of the orn-at mutants were grown in
hanging drops by the vapor diffusion technique under conditions similar to those described previously for the wild-type protein (12): 6 –10%
 xxxd2982xxx  6000, 120 –160 mm nacl, 50 mm tricine, ph 7.9,
and 1 mm dithiothreitol. like the wild-type orn-at crystals, they
belong to space group p3221, contain three molecules in the asymmetric
unit, and have similar unit cell dimensions (a ⫽ b ⫽ 115.72 å, c ⫽ 186.55

å for the y85i mutant; a ⫽ b ⫽ 115.95 å, c ⫽ 188.34 å for the g320f/
y55a/y85i mutant). for data collection, the crystals were transferred to
a reservoir solution containing 25% glycerol and flash-frozen at 100 k in
gaseous nitrogen. x-ray diffraction data of the triple orn-at mutant at
2.15 å resolution were collected at the swiss light source (villigen,
switzerland). a y85i orn-at mutant crystal was analyzed in-house,
and a 3.0 å resolution data set was recorded on an mar 345 image plate
detector using a rigaku rotating anode generator with osmic mirrors.
all data were processed with mosflm and scaled with scala from
the ccp4 suite (13). the structures of the two mutants were obtained
from a rigid body refinement using the wild-type orn-at structure (12)
as a starting model. refinement was performed with refmac5 (13)
and included tls refinement. an automated search for water molecules, using the program arp (14), was included as part of the refinement protocol. non-crystallographic symmetry restraints over the
three subunits were kept throughout the refinement of the y85i
orn-at mutant model, but none were applied in the case of the y85i/
y55a/g320f mutant. model inspection and rebuilding were carried out
with program o (15). the stereochemistry of the refined models was
validated with the program procheck (16). the coordinates have
been deposited in the protein data bank (accession codes 2byj and
2byl for y85i and y85i/y55a/g320f mutants, respectively). figs. 1
and 5 were generated with dino (17).

results and discussion
determination of kinetic properties—to determine the kinetic
parameters controlling the separate half-reactions with different substrates, we conducted single turnover experiments in which we followed
changes in coenzyme absorbance as the enzyme converts between its
420-nm-absorbing pyridoxaldimine form (el) and its 330-nm-absorbing pyridoxamine form (em). an analysis of the kinetics of the separate
half-reactions of wild-type rat kidney orn-at with ornithine, glutamate, and ketoglutarate has been reported earlier (3). in the present
work, similar analyses were conducted on recombinant wild-type
human orn-at to provide a reliable basis for determining the effects of
the mutations. a study of the half-reaction of wild-type orn-at with
gaba was also carried out. changes in absorbance from all the halfreactions fitted well to single exponential processes, and the observed
first-order rate constants (kobs) showed hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration (equations 1 and 2, “experimental procedures”).
the results of all these kinetic analyses are reported in tables one
through four.
properties of the wild-type enzyme—the klim/ks values found for the
wild-type enzyme indicated that it is 450 times more effective at catalyzing the reaction of el with ornithine than that with glutamate. the

umns, 20 mm tris/hcl, ph 7.6, was replaced by 20 mm epps, ph 7.6.
this purification resulted in enzyme that was completely in the el form.
for experiments requiring the em form of the enzyme, the el form (0.5
ml, 100 ␮m) was treated with 5 ␮l of 100 mm  xxxd2793xxx  and separated
on sephadex g-25 equilibrated in 20 mm epps, ph 7.6. orn-at and
 xxxg8xxx  were assayed by the methods of peraino et al. (10) and silverman and levy (11), respectively.
acquisition and analysis of kinetic data—experiments analyzing the
half-reactions of el and em with single substrates were carried out on a
stopped-flow spectrophotometer (model  xxxg1604xxx , hi-tech, salisbury,
uk). all the reactions were carried out at 25 °c in 20 mm epps brought
to ph 7.6 with naoh. absorbance was measured at 420 nm and was
displayed using the is-2 software supplied with the instrument. all of
the stopped-flow analyses of single reactions fitted well to single exponential processes. at least three experiments were carried out at each
substrate concentration. amplitudes and apparent first-order rate constants (kobs) were determined using the non-linear regression software
package provided with the instrument. equation 1 was used to analyze
the dependence of kobs on substrate concentration for the reactions of
ornithine and glutamate with el forms of the enzyme and of ketoglutarate with em forms.

difference between the kinetic behavior toward the two substrates was
entirely in the ks term, an observation that accords well with the
hypothesis that glu-235 must disengage from its interaction with arg413 before glutamate can bind productively to el. we expected that this
disengagement would also be necessary for ketoglutarate to bind the em
form of the enzyme. however, we found that the reaction of em with
ketoglutarate is the fastest of the half-reactions of the wild-type enzyme
tested in this study and has a ks value lower than that for ornithine in its
reaction with el. this observation suggested that, in the case of em, arg413 is readily available for binding ketoglutarate, possibly because the interaction between arg-413 and glu-235 is weakened. further observations,
which will be presented later in this study, supported this proposal.
properties of mutant forms of orn-at—the structure of orn-at
bound to ornithine analogues shows that the ␣-amino group of ornithine is held between the oh groups of tyr-55 and tyr-85 (5). mutation
of either residue resulted in a similar lowering of klim/ks: 400-fold for
tyr-55 and 1000-fold for tyr-85. thus, the contribution of each of these
interactions to decreasing the activation energy for the reaction is relatively high (14 –16 kj/mole), demonstrating that both of these tyrosines
are major contributors to the productive binding of ornithine. the fact
that y55a and y55g mutations led to a relatively small decrease (8-fold

y85i. in terms of klim/ks, the el form of this mutant reacted 19 times
more rapidly with gaba than did the wild-type enzyme (fig. 3). fig. 3
shows that the total change in a420 for the reaction also increased with
gaba concentration, indicating that the product, succinic semialdehyde, dissociates less readily from em than do the products of reaction
with ornithine and glutamate. comparison of the relevant klim/ks constants demonstrated that this mutation converted the wild-type
enzyme, which has a 3200-fold preference for ornithine, to an enzyme
with a 5-fold preference for gaba. thus, the y85i mutation resulted in
a 16,000-fold alteration of specificity in the predicted direction. the
value of klim/ks for the half-reaction of orn-at-y85i with gaba (1.0
mm⫺1s⫺1) is close to that estimated for wild-type mammalian
 xxxg8xxx  (1.3 mm⫺1s⫺1, ref. 2) which has klim and ks values that are
both ⬃30-fold higher than the corresponding values for orn-at-y85i.
thus, the presence of tyrosine or isoleucine as residue 85 was a major
determinant of the ability of the enzyme to discriminate between gaba
and ornithine.
despite the major negative effect of the y85i mutation on the reaction
with ornithine, the reaction with glutamate was slightly enhanced.
moreover, we observed a significant, and unexpected, effect on the reaction of the y85i mutant with ketoglutarate (fig. 4). although ks for the
reaction of wild-type em with this substrate was low (0.26 mm), the
corresponding value for the reaction of em-y85i was too high to be

determined because kobs increased linearly with ketoglutarate concentration until the reaction became too fast to be measured since it was
complete within the 2-ms mixing time of the instrument. the value
of kobs was greater than 2000 s⫺1 at ketoglutarate concentrations
above 12.5 mm. thus, this mutation increased the value of klim for the
em:ketoglutarate reaction by at least 12-fold and the value of ks by at
least 48-fold. we were surprised that the y85i mutation so greatly
affected the ketoglutarate reaction but had no effect on the glutamate
reaction. this observation would be explained if the reaction of el with
glutamate includes an extra step in which glu-235 is displaced from
arg-413 by a conformational change that is slow enough to make a
major contribution to kobs for the reaction in this direction.
structure of orn-at-y85i—we have solved the structure of ornat-y85i to a resolution of 3 å. apart from the mutation itself, there
were no significant differences between wild-type and mutant structures. furthermore, the backbone and c␤, c␥1, and c␦ atoms of tyr-85
in wild-type orn-at and ile-85 in y85i mutant orn-at are in almost
identical positions (fig. 5a). two small differences between the structures of the mutant and wild-type enzymes should be noted. first, in the
mutant, the methyl group c␥2 of ile-85 fitted into a pocket between the
lys-292-plp aldimine and the amide of asn-266. this pocket was
vacant in the wild-type enzyme. second, in the mutant, the substrate
binding cavity was substantially enlarged because of the absence of the
atoms of the tyrosine side chain (fig. 5a). these differences, together
with the loss of van der waals contacts between tyr-85 side chain and
the substrate (5), may explain the significant decrease in reactivity
toward ornithine observed for orn-at-y85i.
however, the 19-fold increase in klim/ks toward gaba also contributed significantly to the changed specificity. our kinetic data indicated
that ile-85 does not have a major effect on substrate binding as shown by
the relatively small change in ks. instead, the 19-fold increase in klim/ks
was clearly due to a 60-fold increase in klim. superimposition of the
structures of  xxxg8xxx  and orn-at-y85i (fig. 5a) shows that ile-85 is
shifted by about 2 å with respect to the homologous ile-72 of gabaat. together with this positional shift, the two isoleucines displayed
different rotamer conformations because  xxxg8xxx  ile-72 makes contact with phe-351*, which is not present in the orn-at structure.
assuming that gaba binds to the active site as in  xxxg8xxx  with its
carboxylate bound to arg-180 (6), it seems unlikely that the side chain of
tyr-85 would hinder binding, although the 3-fold increased ks term
indicates that binding to form the external aldimine is made slightly
more difficult by the y85i mutation. we propose that the 60-fold
increase in klim arises because ile-85 constrains the orientation of gaba
substrate so that its c␥–h bond is held more nearly perpendicular to the
cofactor imine plane, thereby accelerating the proton abstraction that is
central to catalysis (18). aspartate aminotransferase (asp-at) has
val-37 in a position similar to that of ile-85 in orn-at-y85i (8). one of
the valine c␥ atoms is seen to make contact with c␤ of the substrate
analogue ␣-methyl aspartate in the way we propose for ile-85 and
gaba in orn-at-y85i.
finally, the major difference in the kinetic behavior of wt-orn-at
and the y85i mutant concerned the large increases of both klim and ks
for the reaction of em with ketoglutarate. these were probably due to
the introduction of c␥2 of ile-85 into a position close to lys-292, which
mediates the proton transfer, and also close to the carbon atoms (c4⬘ of
the cofactor and c␥ of gaba) between which the proton is transferred.
conceivably, the c4⬘–h bond of the cofactor was also constrained to be
more nearly orthogonal to the cofactor ring.

missing, but the ring of phe-320* occupied the space taken up by the ␣and ␤-carbons of ornithine when it was bound to the wild-type enzyme.
it seemed likely that the major loss of activity toward glutamate, gaba,
and ketoglutarate is caused by obstruction of the carboxylate substrate
binding site by phe-320*.
a possible explanation for the observation that the phe-320* side
chain does not occupy the space vacated by the tyr-55 side chain and so
does not adopt a similar orientation to that of phe-351* in  xxxg8xxx  is
that in  xxxg8xxx , phe-351* makes contact with the ring of tyr-348*, a
residue arising from a turn at a conserved proline residue (phe-347 in
 xxxg8xxx , phe-316 in orn-at). the orn-at residue corresponding
to tyr-348* in  xxxg8xxx  was glycine. it seemed that, in the absence of
the potential van der waals and hydrophobic interactions with the
homologue of tyr-348*, phe-320* takes up a position in which it makes
these interactions with phe-177.
reactions of glu-235 mutants—the kinetics of the half-reactions of
the el forms of orn-at-e235s and orn-at-e235a with ornithine
were also adversely affected: 8- and 1600-fold decreases, respectively.
the structure of orn-at-wt complexed with 5-fluoromethylornithine showed that the c␥ and c␦ of glu-235 make van der waals
contact with the c␣ and c␦ of the ornithine analogue. it seemed likely
that these contacts contribute both to tighter binding and to proper
orientation of this substrate. both e235s and e235a mutations led to a
lowering of klim and an increase in ks, although the relatively minor
effects of the serine mutation suggest that the hydroxyl group of this
residue remains h-bonded to arg-413, leaving the atoms of its side
chain still able to make some productive contact with ornithine.

(33 ␮m) and ornithine at concentrations up to 50 mm and times up to 30
min. the absorption spectrum (a420 ⫽ 0.22, a280 ⫽ 1.84) remained
constant throughout the experiment. however, slow reactions between
the el form of this mutant were observed with both glutamate and
gaba. in both cases, a420 decreased exponentially and kobs increased
linearly with substrate concentration up to the highest concentration
examined (0.1 m). at this concentration of glutamate, some precipitation of the protein was observed. although independent values of klim
and ks could not be determined for these reactions, the slope of the line
relating kobs with substrate concentration is equal to klim/ks. the value
of this constant was very much lower for both substrates than for the
wild-type enzyme and all other mutants tested. the reaction of the em
form of orn-at-y85i:y55a:g320f with ketoglutarate was more than
100 times faster than the reaction of the el form with either glutamate
or gaba, and the dependence on ketoglutarate concentration was
hyperbolic. however, the value of klim/ks was more than 15,000 times
lower than for the wild-type enzyme with both klim and ks being
adversely affected. comparison of the structures of the active sites of
 xxxg8xxx  and the triple mutant orn-at-y85i:y55a:g320f (fig. 5b)
shows that the newly introduced phe-320 side chain introduced into
orn-at does not occupy the same steric position as phe-351 in gabaat, although the backbone atoms of the residues are in almost identical
positions.
the complete loss of reactivity with ornithine was not surprising.
single mutations of the tyrosine residues that bind the ␣-amino group of
ornithine (tyr-85 and tyr-55) made the reaction with ornithine 1000
and 400 times slower, respectively. not only were both these tyrosines

the e235s mutation produced the same minor effect on klim for the
reaction of el with glutamate as for the reaction with ornithine. however, whereas ks for the ornithine reaction was increased 5-fold, ks for
glutamate was decreased 10-fold. the e235a mutation produced qualitatively similar results, but quantitatively, the effects were much
greater. for glutamate, the values of klim and ks were lowered 28- and
18,000-fold, respectively, with the result that klim/ks was increased 650fold. comparison of the relevant klim/ks values showed that mutation of
glu-235 to serine produced a switch in specificity away from ornithine
and toward glutamate of 50-fold, whereas mutation of this residue to
alanine produced a switch in the same direction by a factor of 106. these
observations suggested that a major function of the interaction between
the side chains of arg-418 and glu-235 is to limit reaction with glutamate and, to a lesser extent, to promote reaction with ornithine. the
further observations that the glu-235 mutations had little effect on the
reaction of em with ketoglutarate added support to the proposal, made
earlier in this work, that glu-235 interacts weakly (or not at all) with
arg-418 in the em form of the enzyme.
effect of e235a mutation on the regiospecificity of the reaction with
ornithine—we conducted experiments to test the proposal that masking of arg-418 by glu-235 prevents arg-418 from binding the ␣-carboxylate of ornithine, thus ensuring that transamination occurs exclusively at the ␻-amino group of this substrate. the transamination
mechanism requires proton abstraction from the carbon atom bearing
the transferred amino group and, if a single half-reaction is carried out
in d2o, the relevant proton is exchanged (19). this exchange occurs
because the half-reaction between amino substrate and oxo product
continues to run in both directions after equilibrium is reached,
although there is no net change in substrate and product concentrations. it has previously been shown by proton nmr spectroscopy that
rat kidney orn-at exclusively replaces the pro-s proton on c␦ of ornithine (3). in this work, we confirmed this observation by demonstrating
that the area under the peak attributed to the two protons on c␦ of

the initial enzyme concentration was 0.1 mm, but extensive precipitation occurred early
in the experiment (see “results and discussion”).

ornithine (30 mm) was reduced to half after 50 min in the presence of
recombinant human orn-at (0.3 mm). we also used 13c nmr analysis
of the same deuterated ornithine sample to demonstrate that the
exchange at c␦ was stereospecific. proton broad band decoupled 13c
nmr was a particularly appropriate technique for detecting and quantifying replacement of 1h by 2h at identifiable carbon atoms because all
the 13c peaks appeared as sharp singlets until 1h was replaced by 2h. fig.
6 shows the 13c nmr spectrum of ornithine before and after treatment
with orn-at in d2o. the peak due to c␦ was a singlet before treatment
and a 1:1:1 triplet after. this demonstrated that only one of the 1h atoms
on c␦ has been replaced (replacement of both 1h atoms would have
resulted in a quintuplet). the peak attributed to the c␣ proton was a
singlet in both samples. we experienced some difficulty in conducting
the same experiment with the mutant orn-at-e235a. when we used
the same enzyme concentration as in the corresponding experiment
with the wild-type enzyme (0.3 mm), the solution became cloudy immediately after adding ornithine and, after 16 h, a dense precipitate had
formed. after separation of precipitated protein by centrifugation and
soluble protein by centrifugal ultrafiltration, 13c nmr showed a small
amount of replacement at c␦ (data not shown). a similar experiment
carried out at a lower enzyme concentration (0.1 mm) for 48 h resulted
in substantially less precipitation and more extensive replacement (fig.
5c). the signal due to c␦ was now composed of a singlet and a triplet.
this showed that some of one of the protons on c␦ had been replaced by
2
h to produce the triplet. the singlet was attributed to c␦, which still
had two 1h atoms. the peak due to c␣ remained as a sharp singlet,
showing that no exchange had taken place at c␣. measurement of the
relative heights of the residual c␦ singlet and the c␥ singlet allowed the
fraction of 1h exchanged to be estimated as ⬃50%. thus, after unmasking arg-418 by mutating glu-235, orn-at retained its ability to
transaminate the ␻-amino group of ornithine in preference to the ␣-amino group, demonstrating that the arg-418/glu-235 interaction is not
responsible for the regiospecificity of the wild-type enzyme in its reaction with ornithine.
binding of dicarboxylate ligands—our kinetic analysis yielded the
following important observations. wild-type orn-at el enzyme
reacted better with ornithine than with glutamate because of a higher
affinity for ornithine. this preference was reversed when glu-235 was
mutated either to serine or to alanine. indeed, both mutations resulted
in lower ks values for glutamate. however, this was not what we
observed when considering the second half-reaction catalyzed by the
enzyme, i.e. that between em and ketoglutarate. mutation of glu-235
had little effect on that reaction. e235s had virtually no effect, and
e235a increased klim/ks but 100 times less than that of the el/glutamate
reaction. to understand this different behavior toward the two dicarboxylate substrates, we must keep in mind that in the el form that reacts
with glutamate, the cofactor is bound as a protonated aldimine with lys292, whereas in the em form that reacts with ketoglutarate, the coenzyme is
 xxxd3048xxx  and is not covalently bound to the enzyme. the
crystallographic structure of the enzyme, solved using the el form (6, 7),
shows a network of h-bonds connecting glu-235 and arg-413 to o4⬘ of
the cofactor via the side chain amide of gln-266. it is possible that when
the cofactor is  xxxd3048xxx , this h-bond network is
affected so as to weaken the interaction between arg-413 and glu-235.
we thus propose a system in which the glu-235 switch is closed in the
el form, thereby allowing productive binding of ornithine but impeding
binding of glutamate and open in the em form, making arg-413 available to bind ketoglutarate. this model fits well with the abundant evidence, demonstrating that, in vivo, orn-at operates in the direction in
which ornithine and ketoglutarate are the substrates (4). moreover, the

determinants of substrate specificity in ␻-aminotransferases
hypothesis is supported by the recently published structure (20) of a
mutant form of  xxxg8xxx  (i50q) that is partially in the em form and in
which the homologue of glu-235 (e211) is seen to be rotated away from
the homologous conserved arginine. furthermore, the structure of the
homologue of orn-at-e235s ( xxxg8xxx -e211s), in which the switch
must be permanently open, shows the enzyme to be entirely in the em
form (20), reinforcing the proposal that the status of the cofactor and
the glu-235 switch are linked.
