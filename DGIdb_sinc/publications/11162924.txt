abstract
in order to satisfy government mandates, numerous studies have been performed categorizing potential endocrine disrupting
chemicals as (anti)estrogens or (anti)androgens. we report here that dihydrotestosterone (dht), a potent, non-aromatizable
 xxxg183xxx  agonist, induces antiestrogenic responses through direct and/or indirect modulation of vitellogenin (vg), steroid
hormone and total cytochrome p450 levels. dht and two weak, aromatizable androgens, dhea and androstenedione (0.05–50
mg/kg per day), were fed to juvenile trout for 2 weeks. dhea and androstenedione significantly increased blood plasma vg by
up to 30- and 45-fold, respectively (p b0.05, t-test). 17b-estradiol (e2) increases were also observed with both androgens, albeit
with lower sensitivity. dht markedly decreased vg and e2 levels, suggesting that dhea and androstenedione increased vg and
e2 via conversion to e2 and not by  xxxg730xxx  agonism. dhea and androstenedione had no effect on total cytochrome
p450 content, while dht significantly decreased p450 content in a dose dependent fashion. these results indicate that alterations
in metabolism mediated by  xxxg183xxx  binding may be responsible for the vg and e2 decreases by dht. in an attempt
to decipher between receptor and non-receptor androgenic mechanisms of the observed dht effects, dht (0, 50 or 100 mg/kg
per day) and  xxxd2143xxx  (0-1250 mg/kg per day), an  xxxg183xxx  antagonist, were fed to juvenile rainbow trout for 2 weeks.
 xxxd2143xxx  alone was as effective as dht in decreasing e2 and vg levels in males but did not significantly reverse dht induced
vg decreases in either sex (p\ 0.05, f-test). dht decreases in total p450 content were partially attenuated in males by  xxxd2143xxx 
co-treatment, but not females, suggesting a partial androgenic mechanism to the p450 decreases as well as a fundamental sex
difference responding to  xxxg183xxx  binding. moreover,  xxxd2143xxx  alone decreased p450 content by up to 30% in males and
40% in females. these effects may be mediated through direct  xxxg183xxx  binding irrespective of whether the binding is
agonistic or antagonistic. this study indicates that  xxxg183xxx  agonists/antagonists can elicit significant antiestrogenic
effects that may not necessarily be mediated through classic receptor binding mechanisms and signal transduction pathways.

1. introduction
estrogenic compounds and their modulating effects
on carcinogenesis, enzyme induction/inhibition and sex
determination has become an increasingly important
area of research. the influence of androgens in this field
has been studied to a much lesser extent. dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea), a weak androgen, has been

established as a potent liver tumor promoter in rainbow
trout in the absence of peroxisome proliferation [1,2].
dhea is also a precursor to estrogens such as 17bestradiol (e2), a potent promoter of carcinogenesis in
many organs such as the liver and breast [3–8]. androstenedione can be directly converted to testosterone
via 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase or estrone via
aromatase. e2 is synthesized via aromatase from testosterone or estrone by the dehydrogenase enzyme [4].
several mechanisms have been postulated for tumor
promotion by estrogens such as production of catechol
metabolites that can induce redox cycling and subse-

quent dna damage and covalent binding, to increases
in cell growth and division [3 – 8]. since dhea is
converted to androstenedione, a precursor to potent
androgens such as testosterone, dihydrotestosterone
(dht) and in teleosts, 11-ketotestosterone (11kt), the
ability to decipher between estrogenic and androgenic
responses is critical.
vitellogenin (vg) is an egg-yolk protein precursor
synthesized in the liver of oviparous animals such as
fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds in response to  xxxg730xxx  binding [9]. it is secreted into the blood
where it is taken up by the ovaries to be incorporated
into the developing eggs [10]. vg synthesis is a well
characterized, sensitive biomarker for  xxxg730xxx 
binding in the rainbow trout liver [11]. many studies
have utilized vg production to screen for and determine
the efficacy and potency of environmental contaminants such as alkylphenols, ddes, and pcbs [12–18].
phytochemicals and natural products that modulate vg
production have been postulated as possible promoting
or chemopreventive agents in estrogen dependent cancers [19,20].
the contribution of natural and synthetic androgens
to endocrine disruption has not been studied to nearly
the degree of estrogens. in some cases androgens are
investigated for estrogenic effects instead of pure androgenic mechanisms. in previous studies, the potent
androgens, dht and 17a-methyltestosterone were
shown to induce vg in fish [21,22]. these studies,
however, were carried out at extremely high doses (1000
mg/kg) and were not believed to be physiologically
relevant. in contrast, another study reported that 17amethyltestosterone inhibited vg gene expression and
serum e2 levels in tilapia [23]. one reason for the
contrasting results in the few studies that have been
performed, may be the lack of a well characterized
biomarker like vg. in mammals, screening for prostate
specific antigen levels in blood serum is an accepted
biomarker for androgen status to indicate high risk
subjects for prostate cancer. in mice, the use of 6a/15aoh ratios has been proposed as another biomarker,
which is superior to measuring circulating hormone
levels, which are highly variable and make detection of
alterations by xenobiotics difficult [24]. in rats, testosterone and dht were found to lower luteinizing hormone secretion in the presence and absence of e2 [25].
alterations in steroid metabolizing enzymes, either
through modulation of synthesis or degradation could
have profound effects on estrogenic pathways. numerous hepatic phase i and ii enzymes metabolize estrogens and androgens [26 – 28]. marked shifts in the levels
and activities of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, as
previously demonstrated [29 – 31], would presumably
affect the type and degree of estrogenic and androgenic
responses. the importance of this and other indirect
mechanisms of action by androgens may affect re-

sponses that are classically regarded as estrogen mediated [32]. in one study, you et al. [33] found that male
rats exposed to p,p% dde had elevated cytochrome
p4502b1 and 3a1 protein levels which resulted in an
increase in the respective hydroxylated testosterone
products. administration of 17b-estradiol to rainbow
trout lowered mean hepatic 6b-hydroxylase activity and
total cytochrome p450 content, which indicates that
steroids can modulate metabolic enzyme protein levels
and activity [34].
in this paper, we compared the ability of dhea,
androstenedione, and dht, a non-aromatizable androgen, to elicit estrogenic responses, by measuring vg
induction in rainbow trout. we also quantified blood
plasma e2 in order to measure conversion rates of each
androgen. in an attempt to shed light on some possible
metabolic effects of androgens, we quantified total liver
microsomal cytochrome p450 content for each group.
additionally, we investigated the possible mediation of
vg, e2 and total cytochrome p450 content through the
 xxxg183xxx  utilizing the antiandrogen,  xxxd2143xxx .
the aim of these studies was to determine sensitive
endpoints and indicators of androgen exposure and to
decipher them from estrogenic responses that would
serve as a basis for future studies.

2. methods and materials
juvenile mt. shasta rainbow trout, oncorhynchus
mykiss, 12–18 months old, were kept in 375 l tanks at
14°c under a 12:12 light:dark cycle and fed a maintenance ration (2.8% w/w) of oregon test diet (otd). to
determine the estrogenic contribution of the three androgens in this experiment, treatment groups of 12
rainbow trout were fed otd containing dmso
(b 0.2% by volume) with or without dissolved dhea,
androstenedione or dht (0.05–50 mg/kg per day) for
14 days. in a second study, we focused on the relationship of the effects observed in the first study with the
 xxxg183xxx . rainbow trout, 16 per treatment
group, were administered diets of otd containing
dht (0, 50 or 100 mg/kg) and  xxxd2143xxx  (0, 100, 250,
750 or 1250 mg/kg) dissolved in dmso for 14 days.
on day 15 of both studies, fish were euthanized with
an overdose of tricane methanesulfonate (ms222) following protocols approved by the oregon state university institutional animal care and use committee.
blood was extracted from the caudal vein into heparinized vials containing 1 mm edta and 50 kiu/ml
aprotinin to slow vg degradation. plasma was collected
by centrifugation of blood at 2000× g for 10 min at
4°c and stored at −80°c. livers were weighed, snap
frozen in liquid n2 and stored at −80°c.
blood plasma vg was quantified using an elisa
described by donohoe and curtis [13], and shilling and

a.d. shilling, d.e. williams / journal of steroid biochemistry & molecular biology 74 (2000) 187–194

williams [35] with antibody raised in rabbits against
chum salmon vg (1:1500 dilution), which was graciously obtained by way of donald buhler, oregon
state university from a. hara at hokkaido university.
colormetric readings for the elisa were performed on
a microtiter plate reader (biotek el 340, winooski,
vt) and analyzed with plate reader software (deltasoft
3, princeton, nj). the linear range of a given assay was
determined to be between 6.25 and 3200 ng vg/ml
sample. samples were diluted accordingly in phosphate
buffered solution, ph 7.2, containing 1% bovine serum
albumin, 0.1% triton x-100 and 0.1% tween-20. although rabbit anti-trout vg antibody was available, we
found that the anti-chum salmon antibody gave relatively similar values throughout the linear concentration range with about a third of the background,
allowing for greater sensitivity (data not shown). a
100-ml aliquot of each blood plasma sample was taken
for steroid analysis. these samples were extracted twice

189

with 2 ml  xxxd2052xxx  and vortex shaken for 20 s. the
tubes were placed in liquid n2 for 8 s and then the ether
layer was poured off and collected. the extract was
concentrated to dryness using a speedvac concentrator
system (savant, holbrook, ny), resuspended in 1 ml of
eia assay buffer and stored at −20°c. 17b-estradiol
(e2) and testosterone (t) levels were measured by eia
with reagents from cayman chemical (ann arbor,
mi). statistical analyses were performed intrasex only
using t-tests for treatment effect and one-way anova
and f-tests comparing differences between treatment
groups.
microsomes were prepared from livers by the method
of guengrich [36]. briefly, tissue homogenized in cold
0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 0.15 m kcl, 1 mm
edta, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf)
was spun for 25 min  xxxd1891xxx  000×g at 4°c. the microsomal fraction was obtained by spinning the supernatant
at 100 000×g for 95 min at 4°c. the pellet was
washed by resuspension in 0.1 m potassium pyrophosphate containing 1 mm edta, 0.1 mm bht and 0.1
mm pmsf followed by a second 95 min spin at
100 000× g. the final microsomal pellet was resuspended in phosphate buffer containing 30% glycerol, 1
mm edta, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm pmsf and
stored at − 80°c. total liver microsomal p450 content
was quantified by the co versus co-reduced difference
spectra [37] on a cary 300 uv-vis spectrophotometer
(varian, walnut creek, ca). values are reported as
nmol p450 and normalized to protein content determined by the lowry method using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard [38].

after 2 weeks, untreated female trout were found to
have significantly higher levels of vg than males, representing a fundamental sex difference in basal vg levels,
even in immature trout (pb 0.01, t-test). comparisons
were performed intrasex only, due to significant sex
differences in vg levels (pb0.05, 1 way anova and
anova f-test) in most of the treatment groups as
well. a dose responsive increase in blood plasma vg
was observed in trout fed dhea and androstenedione
(fig. 1(a)). in trout fed dhea, vg levels increased in
males and females with about 30-fold induction observed at 50 mg/kg per day (pb 0.0001) compared to
corresponding control (otd). the vg response to androstenedione administration was similar to that of
dhea with female levels generally somewhat higher
than male levels. maximum induction at 50 mg/kg per
day androstenedione was 45-fold for females and 30fold for males. in contrast, induction of vg was not
observed in dht fed groups (fig. 1(b)). in fact, vg
significantly decreased by up to 80% in male and female

sion to estrogens, we would not expect increased e2 in
trout fed an androgen that cannot be aromatized, such
as dht. at 50 mg/kg, we actually noticed a significant
55% reduction in male plasma e2 (fig. 2, pb0.005,
t-test). the e2 decrease may be the basis of the vg
decrease since the values of the two parameters corresponded closely.
to investigate possible indirect effects on vg and e2
levels by androgens via alterations in metabolism, total
microsomal cytochrome p-450 content was quantified.
in trout fed dhea or androstenedione, total cytochrome p-450 content was not affected (fig. 3).
dht, however markedly decreased p450 content in a
dose responsive fashion at all doses compared to otd
(fig. 3, pb 0.03 at 0.05 mg/kg and pb 0.0005 at doses
above 0.05 mg/kg, t-test). at the highest dose of dht,
an 81% decrease was seen.
in the first study, the potent non-aromatizable androgen, dht, exhibited antiestrogen-like characteristics in
the rainbow trout. we hypothesized that some of these
effects may be mediated through  xxxg183xxx 
binding and subsequent down-regulation of aromatizable androgen and/or estrogen synthesis. either mechanism would explain the observed vg and e2 decreases.
to test this hypothesis, dht was fed at two high doses
(50 and 100 mg/kg per day) to trout with  xxxd2143xxx , an
 xxxg183xxx  antagonist. after 2 weeks, the antiestrogenic responses were observed in both male and
female rainbow trout in the absence of  xxxd2143xxx . at 50
mg/kg per day, vg levels were 80% lower than trout fed
vehicle (fig. 4). at 100 mg/kg per day, this response
was not as marked, possibly due to some estrogen
receptor agonism, especially in males where vg levels

as was the case with vg, basal e2 levels were twice as
high in untreated females compared to untreated males
(pb0.01, t-test, fig. 2). unfortunately, we were only
able to report values for males due to loss of some
female samples. blood plasma e2 levels were significantly higher in males fed 50 mg/kg dhea or 5 and 50
mg/kg androstenedione (p b 0.05, t-test). a three-fold
induction compared to otd was observed at 50 mg/kg
for dhea and androstenedione. these increases support the hypothesis that these androgens are indeed
being converted to estrogens in vivo. if the previously
observed estrogenic effects are through direct conver-

 xxxd2143xxx  dose (fig. 6).  xxxd2143xxx  had no effect on
trout fed 50 mg/kg dht and there was high variability,
making it difficult to generate relationships between t
and the vg and e2 decreases.  xxxd2143xxx  alone, however, had a profound effect on female t levels, decreasing the steroid by 90% at 1250 mg/kg (pb 0.0005,
f-test). this decrease was not observed in males, suggesting the presence of a sex-specific antiandrogenic
feedback mechanism.
we investigated a possible metabolic effect of dht
through  xxxg183xxx  binding by measuring total
p450 content in liver microsomes from trout fed dht
and  xxxd2143xxx . although there were no significant differences in liver somatic index between groups, dht
lowered p450 content significantly in males and females
(fig. 7).  xxxd2143xxx  had a substantial impact on this
effect in males, blocking p450 decreases induced by
dht in a dose dependent manner. in females, total
p450 content was similar with or without  xxxd2143xxx .
 xxxd2143xxx  alone also lowered total p450 content by
30% in males and 40% in females. these results suggest
a sex specific role for the  xxxg183xxx  pathway
that may not be related to classic agonistic/antagonistic
mechanisms.

4. discussion
we observed striking differences in responses of the
trout fed the aromatizable androgens, dhea and androstenedione, and the structurally similar non-aromatizable androgen, dht. dhea and androstenedione
significantly induced blood plasma vg and e2 levels in

fig. 6. blood plasma t for male (upper graph) and female (lower

trout fed vehicle (p b0.05, t-test assuming unequal variances. ( c)

were higher than controls. the decrease, however, appeared to be in response to a decline in e2 levels which
was also observed in males and females fed dht (fig.
5).  xxxd2143xxx  did not reverse the dht effect, suggesting that the vg and e2 decreases were not due to
pathways directly related to  xxxg183xxx  binding.
it does seem that the  xxxg183xxx  plays some role
because this receptor antagonist was as effective as
dht in decreasing vg and e2 levels, particularly in
males. dht increased t levels two-fold at 100 mg/kg,
an effect that was partially blocked by increasing

juvenile rainbow trout demonstrating the ability for
these androgens to elicit an estrogenic response. dht
did not induce vg or e2 levels, suggesting induction by
dhea and androstenedione was not by direct estrogen
receptor binding, but by conversion to estrogens. support for this conclusion was seen in the dhea and
androstenedione treated fish, where e2 levels increased
in concert with the vg increases, albeit with less sensitivity. in fact, dht markedly lowered vg and e2 levels
in the absence of toxicity, which was assessed grossly,
by body weight, and liver somatic index. decreases in
vg and e2 levels in trout fed dht suggest that this
androgen does not bind the trout  xxxg730xxx  or it
is an  xxxg730xxx  antagonist. receptor binding
assays are underway to answer this question. there is
also the possibility of estrogen down regulation by this
androgen. perhaps it is inhibiting aromatase, the enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens. our lab has
been unsuccessful in uncovering an effective aromatase
inhibitor for trout in vivo to test this hypothesis. the
conversion could be blocked in another way such as
inhibition of luteinizing hormone (lh) secretion that
would be a signal to synthesize estrogens from androgens. turgeon and waring [25] found that dht
blocked  xxxg930xxx  induced lh
secretion in female rat gonadotropes in vitro.
in the second study, dht elicited antiestrogenic-like
responses similar to the first study, reducing vg levels
to 20% of control levels at 50 mg/kg in both males and
females.  xxxd2143xxx  alone, however, also decreased vg
to levels comparable to dht. dht and  xxxd2143xxx 
normally act as opposite entities in regard to androgenic responses, but both of these evoked similar responses concerning vg suppression. there may be some
signal transduction pathways initiated by  xxxg183xxx  binding separate from classic androgen/antiandrogen pathways that ultimately reduce e2. females
may be less sensitive to e2 decreases due to higher
 xxxg730xxx  levels and/or affinity for dht and/or
 xxxd2143xxx  as a substrate, which could offset decreases in
e2 levels. carlson and williams [39] found that even in
immature rainbow trout there is a sex difference in vg
production in response to e2. this difference may be
one of several between males and females regarding
steroid production and metabolism.
we also examined the potential for dht to block
the production of endogenous t, thus depleting the
available pool of androgens for conversion to estrogens. dht increased t levels, an effect that may be an
artifact of crossreactivity in the eia, which has been
estimated by the vendor to be 20%. although  xxxd2143xxx 
significantly decreased e2 in both sexes, t levels were
only lowered in females. it is possible that decreases in
e2 could be a consequence of a depleted androgen pool,
induced by  xxxg183xxx  binding. perhaps separate mechanisms exist that control e2 and t levels in

response to  xxxg183xxx  binding. moreover, these
differences may be sex-specific.
increases in estrogen metabolism by specific cytochrome p450s provide an explanation for the e2
decreases that ultimately would lead to suppressed vg
levels. the highly significant, dose responsive decrease
in total liver p450 content by dht does not support
this hypothesis. feedback mechanisms by dht that
decrease syntheses of estrogens or estrogen precursors,
however, would decrease e2 and vg, a hypothesis that
is supported by the dht data. a previous study in
rainbow trout, implanted with 5 mg of different androgens and e2, found that dht, t, and 17a-methyltestosterone had no effect on total p450 content, however,
although 11kt acted as an inducer [40]. decreases in
hepatic p450 levels may mirror repression of extrahepatic p450s or other sex-steroid-regulated enzymes important for e2 and/or vg synthesis. perhaps the levels
of aromatase in sertoli cells, a cytochrome p450
(p450arom) responsible for the conversion of androgens
to estrogens, is also being lowered in response to dht,
resulting in an accumulation of t. our laboratory is
currently investigating the androgenic effects on specific
p450 isozymes, such as aromatase. although dht
significantly lowered p450 content in males and females, the antiandrogen  xxxd2143xxx  attenuated this effect
in males only. it is possible that total p450 levels may
be under androgen control in males in a fashion that is
quantitatively or qualitatively different from females.
we hope to compare the responses by trout to dht,
the major circulating androgen in mammals to 11kt,
the major androgen in trout, which is also non-aromatizable. this will allow us to study a physiologically
relevant androgen in trout to determine if the dht
responses are predictive of those of the major teleost
androgen. this is critical since significant differences in
phase i and phase ii activities have been reported
between trout and other species [41,42].
the reported and current studies will hopefully
provide a basis for investigating mechanisms and sensitive endpoints of androgen exposure. endogenous and
exogenous androgens may play an important role in
modulating endocrine and metabolic pathways in trout
as well as higher vertebrates.
in summary, trout fed dht have lower vg, e2, and
total p450 content without the standard indications of
toxicity. the antiandrogen,  xxxd2143xxx  also had some
antiestrogenic-like effects in the trout supporting the
role of the  xxxg183xxx  in these responses. the
mechanisms seem less clear due to the similar responses
elicited by these different compounds. there may be
some metabolic modulation associated with dht treatment that may or may not be related to the antiestrogenic effects. the data presented suggest that
antiestrogenic responses can result from androgenic and
antiandrogenic compounds acting in a direct or indirect
manner.
