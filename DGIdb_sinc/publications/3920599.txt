introduction
aldose
reductase,
a
monomeric
nadph-binding protein, has been impli­
cated in the onset of cataract in diabetes and
galactosaemia [see e.g.. van heyningen,
1959; kinoshita et al. 1962; fukushi et al..
1980; harding and crabbe, 1984]. it is pro­

posed that by inhibiting the enzyme, levels
of osmotically active sugar alcohols pro­
duced from glucose would be reduced, thus
preventing onset of cataract or neuropathy
[fukushi et al.. 1980; beyer-mears et al..
1982; gillon et al.. 1983].  xxxg111xxx 
inhibitors can also act as anti-oxidants, and
so may reduce the levels of toxic dicarbonyl

abstract. the protein  xxxg111xxx  has been implicated in cataract in diabetes and
galactosaemia. recently it has been suggested that a number of non-steroidal anti- xxxd2315xxx ­
matory agents have inhibitory activity against  xxxg111xxx  activity, and therefore might
be used to prevent diabetic complications including cataract. steady state kinetic experi­
ments show that  xxxd3259xxx ® ( xxxd3259xxx  sulphoxide) acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of
nadph oxidation with purified bovine lens  xxxg111xxx , with an action that may
involve binding to more than one site on the protein. as a preliminary to studying the effect
on human lens and cataract, a double-masked, placebo-controlled study using random
allocation into parallel groups was conducted on 20 volunteers to determine the penetration
of  xxxd3259xxx  ( xxxd3259xxx ) and its metabolites into normal human  xxxd187xxx , and the effect of the
drug on red cell nadph-oxidising activity. it was found that while  xxxd3259xxx , the sulphoxide
form of the drug, and its metabolites the sulphone and the sulphide could be detected in the
appropriate plasma samples (up to 36 pg of the sulphone / ml of plasma), very little could be
detected in the  xxxd187xxx . there was no significant effect on red cell nadph-oxidising
activity.

materials and methods
protein purification and in vitro assays
bovine lens aldehyde (aldose) reductase was pre­
pared by affinity chromatography and assayed by
monitoring nadph oxidation at 340 nm using a pcrkin-elmcr 555 double-beam spectrophotometer as de­
scribed previously \halder and crabbe. 1984). steadystate kinetic experiments were performed as described

previously |haider and crabbe. 1984], nadph-oxidis­
ing activity in human  xxxd187xxx  was determined at 340
nm using a perkin-elmcr 555 double beam spec­
trophotometer as described previously |crabbe et al..
1981; 19831.
subjects
the study consisted of 20 normal volunteers (10
males. 10 females) free from diabetes as defined by (1)
no history of diabetic symptoms or hypoglycaemia or
glycosuria at any time: (2) random venous plasma glu­
cose levels of < 11 mm or fasting levels of < 8 mm.
subjects were randomly allocated into three groups (1)
received  xxxd3259xxx  placebo b.d. for 7 days (6 patients);
(2) received 200 mg of  xxxd3259xxx  b.d. for 7 days (7 pa­
tients), and (3) received 300 mg of  xxxd3259xxx  b.d. for 7
days (7 patients). subjects refrained from any medica­
tion during the study, in particular salicylates. the
study was double-masked with controlled drug intake.
extraction and estimation o f drug levels
human  xxxd187xxx  and plasma were treated as de­
scribed previously \pelchey and crabbe. 1984) and
levels of  xxxd3259xxx ,  xxxd3260xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx  sulphonc determined by high-performance liquid chro­
matography [dusci et al.. 1979|.

results
 xxxd3259xxx  acted as a non-competitive in­
hibitor against dl-glyceraldehyde, d-glucose and nadph with purified bovine lens
aldehyde (aldose) reductase. k¡(intercept)
and kj(slope) values were found to be 0.38
and 0.5 pm for dl-glyceraldehyde and 0.9
and 1.05 pm for /9-glucose. these are com­
parable to values obtained for other potent
 xxxg111xxx  inhibitors [see harding and
crabbe, 1984], figure 1 shows the slope and
intercept replots with 79-glucose as sub­
strate, at fixed nadph concentration. the
kj(intercept) value for nadph as substrate
was 1.5 pm. intercept replots were linear
with dl-glyceraldehyde and nadph as
variable substrates, but a non-linear slope

compounds and free radicals produced from
the autoxidising monosaccharides [ wolff et
al., 1984; thom alley et al., 1984 a, b].
the drug  xxxd3259xxx  ( xxxd3259xxx ; 2-(5-fluoro-2-methyl-1 -\p- {met hylsulphinyl}benzylidine] indene-3-acetic acid) has been in clin­
ical use for 10 years as an anti-inflammatory
agent in the treatment of joint disease. it is
used in man up to a dosage of 600 mg daily
by systemic application, and is free from
serious side effects.  xxxd3259xxx  is the sulphoxide form of the drug, and it is reversibly
metabolised in the body to the more active
sulphide. the sulphoxidc is also irreversibly
oxidised to the much less potent sulphone.
 xxxd3259xxx  has an in vitro activity against aldose
reductase activity which is similar to that of
the spirohydantoin  xxxd3228xxx  (pfiz.cr ltd.,
sandwich, kent), an agent which is capable
of preventing cataract in diabetic animals
[fukushi et al., 1980]. the red cell has simi­
lar pathways for sugar metabolism to the
lens, and is also insulin independent for glu­
cose transport. red cell nadph-oxidising
activity ( xxxg111xxx ) shows many
similarities to lens activity [crabbe et al.,
1981; 1983]. we here report the steadystate
kinetics of lens nadph-oxidising activity
( xxxg111xxx ) inhibition by the drug
and the results of a study to determine the
penetration of  xxxd3259xxx  into the normal hu­
man red cell.

inhibition of bovine lens  xxxg111xxx  by  xxxd3259xxx 

replot with nadph indicated that either
the inhibitor could bind to more than one
binding site on the protein, or that at high
concentration, the inhibitor was interacting
with nadph. when tested as an irrevers­
ible inhibitor,  xxxd3259xxx  showed evidence of
time-dependent inhibition, which however
did not persist. this decrease in the ability
of  xxxd3259xxx  to inhibit nadph oxidation in a
time-dependent manner indicated the possi­
bility of an interconversion of the sulphoxide to a less active form.
table 1 shows the levels of sulphoxide
( xxxd3259xxx ), sulphone and sulphide obtained
in the plasma of normal subjects. those in
group 1 were given a placebo, those in group
2, 200 mg of  xxxd3259xxx , and those in group 3 a
dose of 300 mg  xxxd3259xxx . day 1 indicates the
level before the 7-day treatment, day 8 indi­
cates the level after the last treatment.
there were no significant differences in
blood glucose, hb a,c plasma urea,
creatinine, sodium, potassium,  xxxd3472xxx 
bicarbonate, albumin, globulin, bilirubin.

discussion
the results confirm that the sulphoxide
form of the drug is metabolished into the
sulphide and the sulphone. after 8-day
treatment, the majority of the drug is in the
sulphone form. the half-life of the sulphox­
ide is shorter than that of either the sulphide
or the sulphone. and as equilibrium between
the forms is very rapid (< 1 h) [duggan et
al., 1980] the lower measured levels of the
sulphoxide are not surprising. our study
measured free drug levels. it is known that
the majority of the drug is protein-bound,
particularly in the plasma [duggan et al.,
1980], and therefore our measured levels
may not reflect total drug levels in plasma
and red cell. this may explain the low levels
found in the red cell: either the drugs do not
penetrate the red cell membrane, or if they
do, they bind tightly to proteins in the cell
membrane or to soluble proteins in the red
cell, probably haemoglobin. either way,
they do not significantly influence the ab­
sorbance change at 340 nm produced by red
cell extracts. this is a measure of (a)
nadph-oxidising activity caused by
superoxide produced from the autoxidising

glyceraldehyde, and enhanced in the pres­
ence of the nucleotide-binding ‘reductase’,
and (b) a measure of haemoglobin oxidation
to methaemoglobin [tliornalley ct al.,
1984b]. thus it appears that while  xxxd3259xxx  is
a good in vitro inhibitor of nadph-oxidation catalysed by  xxxg111xxx , its phar­
macokinetic and protein-binding properties
mean that unless high levels of the drug are
used, little effect on the oxidative pathways
implicated in diabetic complications is likely
to result. it is possible that poor penetration
into red cell does not necessarily mean poor
penetration into lens, although in other
studies we have found equal penetration
of another ‘ xxxg111xxx  inhibitor’,
 xxxd3228xxx . into lens and red cell (crabbe et
al.. 1984).

arc generally higher than that of the sulphoxide. the red cell drug levels were too
low to influence polyol pathway metabolite
levels.
table i also shows the change in absorb­
ance at 340 nm/min/ml of samples in the
three groups. there is no significant alter­
ation in activity in any group after treat­
ment. although mean group 3 levels are
higher than other groups on days 1 and 8,
the standard deviations of activities are too
large to allot any significance to this.
