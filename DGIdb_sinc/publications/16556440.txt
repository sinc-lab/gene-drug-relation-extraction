abstract
a specific binding site for the antiepileptic drug  xxxd2466xxx  (2s-(oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)butanamide,  xxxd2466xxx ®) in rat brain, referred to as the
 xxxd2466xxx  binding site, was discovered several years ago. more recently, this binding site has been identified as the synaptic vesicle protein 2a
( xxxg2233xxx ), a protein present in synaptic vesicles [lynch, b., lambeng, n., nocka, k., kensel-hammes, p., bajjalieh, s.m., matagne, a., fuks, b.,
2004. the synaptic vesicle protein  xxxg2233xxx  is the binding site for the antiepileptic drug  xxxd2466xxx . proc. natl. acad. sci. usa, 101, 9861–9866.]. in
this study, we characterized the binding properties of  xxxd2466xxx  in post-mortem human brain and compared them to human  xxxg2233xxx  expressed in
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells. the results showed that the binding properties of  xxxd2466xxx  and [3h]ucb 30889, an analogue that was
previously characterized as a suitable ligand for  xxxd2466xxx  binding site/ xxxg2233xxx  in rat brain [gillard, m., fuks, b., michel, p., vertongen, p.,
massingham, r. chatelain, p., 2003. binding characteristics of [3h]ucb 30889 to  xxxd2466xxx  binding sites in rat brain. eur. j. pharmacol. 478,
1–9.], are almost identical in human brain samples (cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum) and in cho cell membranes expressing the human
 xxxg2233xxx  protein. moreover, the results are also similar to those previously obtained in rat brain. [3h]ucb 30889 binding in human brain and to sv2awas
saturable and reversible. at 4 °c, its binding kinetics were best fitted assuming a two-phase model in all tissues. the half-times of association for the
fast component ranged between 1 to 2 min and represent 30% to 36% of the sites whereas the half-times for the slow component ranged from 20 to
29 min. in dissociation experiments, the half-times were from 2 to 4 min for the fast component (33% to 49% of the sites) and 20 to 41 min for the slow
component. saturation binding curves led to kd values for [3h]ucb 30889 of 53 ± 7, 55 ± 9, 70 ± 11 and 75 ± 33 nm in human cerebral cortex,
hippocampus, cerebellum and cho cells expressing  xxxg2233xxx  respectively. bmax values around 3–4 pmol/mg protein were calculated in all brain
regions. some of the saturation curves displayed curvilinear scatchard plots indicating the presence of high and low affinity binding sites. when this
was the case, kd values from 25 to 30 nm for the high affinity sites (24% to 34% of total sites) and from 200 to 275 nm for the low affinity sites were
calculated. this was observed in all brain regions and in cho cell membranes expressing the  xxxg2233xxx  protein. it cannot be explained by putative
binding of [3h]ucb 30889 to sv2b or c isoforms but may reflect different patterns of  xxxg2233xxx  glycosylation or the formation of  xxxg2233xxx  oligomers.
competition experiments were performed to determine the affinities for  xxxg2233xxx  of a variety of compounds including  xxxd2466xxx , some of its
analogues and other molecules known to interact with  xxxd2466xxx  binding sites in rat brain such as bemegride, pentylenetetrazol and
chlordiazepoxide. we found an excellent correlation between the affinities of these compounds measured in human brain, rat brain and cho cells
expressing human  xxxg2233xxx . in conclusion, we report for the first time that the binding characteristics of native  xxxd2466xxx  binding sites/ xxxg2233xxx  in
human brain and rat brain share very similar properties with human recombinant  xxxg2233xxx  expressed in cho cells.

 xxxd2466xxx  (2s-(oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)butanamide,  xxxd2466xxx ®) is a novel antiepileptic drug marketed as add-on therapy
for partial-onset seizures in adults (hovinga, 2001).

m. gillard et al. / european journal of pharmacology 536 (2006) 102–108

 xxxd2466xxx  has a peculiar pharmacological profile that
distinguishes it from all the other antiepileptic drugs. while it
affords protection against seizures induced in audiogenic
genetically susceptible mice as well as in electrically or pentylenetetrazol induced kindling models, it is devoid of anticonvulsant activity in most acute animal models of epilepsy such as
the maximal electroshock model (klitgaard et al., 1998;
klitgaard, 2001). its mechanism of action does not involve the
classical targets of the other antiepileptic drugs i.e. gammaaminobutyric acid (gaba) facilitation, inhibition of sodium
channels or modulation of low-voltage activated calcium
channels (margineanu and klitgaard, 2002; rigo et al., 2002).
however, a brain specific binding site for  xxxd2466xxx , named
 xxxd2466xxx  binding site was described and characterized in rat
brain for the first time in 1995 (noyer et al., 1995) using [3h]
 xxxd2466xxx  as radioligand. the binding of  xxxd2466xxx  to this
site was reversible, saturable and highly stereoselective. the
availability of a new, more potent analogue, [3h]ucb 30889
enabled further characterization of these sites using autoradiography (gillard et al., 2003). also, irreversible binding of the
radioligand under uv irradiation was performed permitting
covalent binding and subsequent determination of the molecular
weight of the binding site (fuks et al., 2003). this led to the
cloning and the identification of this site as being the  xxxg2233xxx 
protein (lynch et al., 2004). the combined observations that
 xxxg2233xxx  knock-out mice develop lethal seizures soon after birth
(crowder et al., 1999) together with an excellent correlation
between the affinity of  xxxd2466xxx  analogues for  xxxg2233xxx  in rat
brain or for the recombinant protein and their anticonvulsant
potency in audiogenic mice (noyer et al., 1995; lynch et al.,
2004) strongly support a role of  xxxg2233xxx  in the antiepileptic
properties of  xxxd2466xxx .
the biology of  xxxg2233xxx  itself is not entirely elucidated but it
has been proposed that  xxxg2233xxx  proteins are involved in exocytosis
and more particularly, because of their structural analogy with
transporters, may play a role in the homeostasis of synaptic
vesicle constituents such as atp or calcium (bajjalieh et al.,
1992; janz et al., 1999). impact on calcium homeostasis is
further supported by data showing that  xxxg2233xxx  interacts with
synaptotagmin, a protein considered as a calcium sensor
(schivell et al., 2005) and by the recent publication by cataldi
et al. (2005) showing that  xxxd2466xxx  inhibits bradykinin- and
atp-induced inositol triphosphate (ip3)-dependent calcium
release in pc12 cells, cells that are known to possess  xxxg2233xxx 
but not in 3t3-fibroblasts where  xxxg2233xxx  is absent.
this paper reports an in-depth comparison of the binding
properties of the human recombinant  xxxg2233xxx  protein expressed
in cho cells with those of the native protein, present in its
natural environment, the human brain.
2. materials and methods
2.1. drugs and radioligand
 xxxd2466xxx  (2s-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)butanamide), piracetam (2-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl) xxxd63xxx ), ucb 30889 ((2s)-2[4-(3-azidophenyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl]butanamide) and ana-

logues were synthesised at ucb (braine l'alleud, belgium).
bemegride, bicuculline, chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital
were purchased from sigma-aldrich (bornem, belgium).
pentylentetrazol was acquired from acros organics (pittsburgh,
usa). [3h]ucb 30889 (32 ci/mmol) was custom labelled by
amersham biosciences (roosendaal, the netherlands).
iscove's modified dulbecco's medium (imdm), dulbecco's
phosphate buffered saline (pbs), penicillin, streptomycin, fetal
bovine serum and l-glutamine were acquired from cambrex
(verviers, belgium).  xxxd2191xxx  was purchased from invitrogen
(merelbeke, belgium). all other reagents were of analytical
grade and obtained from conventional commercial sources.
2.2. tissues and cell membrane preparations
2.2.1. human brain tissue
human brain samples (cerebellum, hippocampus and
cerebral cortex) were purchased from abs (wilmington, de,
usa). donors were all caucasian, 4 males and 2 females and all
samples have been collected from 4 to 6.5 h post-mortem. none
of the donors had diagnosed neurological problems. brain
samples were shipped in dry ice and stored at − 80 °c until used.
all subsequent operations were performed at 4 °c. the tissues
were homogenised (10% w/v) in 20 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph
7.4) containing 250 mm of sucrose (buffer a). the homogenates were spun at 30,000 ×g at 4 °c for 15 min and the
pellets resuspended in the same buffer. after incubation at 37 °c
for 15 min, the membranes were washed 3 times using the same
centrifugation protocol. the final pellets were resuspended in
buffer a at a protein concentration of 10 to 15 mg/ml and stored
in liquid nitrogen.
2.2.2.  xxxg2233xxx  expressed in cho cells
human  xxxg2233xxx  was cloned from a fetal brain cdna library as
described in lynch et al. (2004) and was subsequently stably
expressed in cho cells. cho cells were subcultured in imdm
medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 iu/ml penicillin,
50 mug/ml streptomycin, 400 mug/ml  xxxd2191xxx  and supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum. the cells were grown at 37 °c in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 and 95% air. confluent cells
were detached by a 10 min incubation in pbs containing 1 mm
edta. all subsequent operations were performed at 4 °c. the
cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 500 g. the pellet
was homogenized in 20 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.4), 250 mm
sucrose buffer and frozen in liquid nitrogen at a protein
concentration of 5 mg/ml.
2.3. binding studies
2.3.1. [3h]ucb 30889 binding
experiments were performed essentially as described in
gillard et al. (2003). membrane proteins (0.1–0.3 mg/assay)
were incubated 120 min at 4 °c in 0.5 ml of a 50 mm tris–hcl
buffer (ph 7.4) containing 2 mm mgcl2, [3h]ucb 30889 (1 to
3 nm) and increasing concentrations of unlabelled competing
drugs. non-specific binding was defined as the residual binding
observed in the presence of 1 mm of unlabelled  xxxd2466xxx .

104

m. gillard et al. / european journal of pharmacology 536 (2006) 102–108

at the end of the incubation period, the membrane-bound
radioligand was recovered by rapid filtration through gf/c
glass fiber filters pre-soaked in 0.1% polyethyleneimine and
1 mm  xxxd2466xxx . the membranes were washed with 8 ml of
ice-cold 50 mm tris hcl buffer (ph 7.4). the total filtration
procedure did not exceed 10 s per sample. the filters were dried
and the radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation. for
association kinetics, specific [3h]ucb 30889 binding was
measured at the indicated after addition of the membranes.
for dissociation studies, membranes were first incubated
120 min at 4 °c with [3h]ucb 30889. further association of
the radioligand was then prevented by the addition of 1 mm
 xxxd2466xxx  and the samples were filtered at increasing
intervals of time thereafter.
for saturation binding studies, membranes (0.3 mg/assay)
were incubated 240 min at 4 °c with concentrations of [3h]ucb
30889 ranging from 1 to 500 nm (concentrations above 35 nm
were obtained by isotopic dilution).
2.4. data analysis
data analysis was performed by computerized non-linear
curve fitting methods (graphpad prism® software, version 4.0,
san diego, ca), according to equations describing several
binding models (molinoff et al., 1981). ic50 was corrected to ki
by applying the cheng and prusoff (1973) equation.
3. results
3.1. binding kinetics
the binding of [3h]ucb 30889 in human brain and to
recombinant  xxxg2233xxx  was reversible and displayed both biphasic
association and dissociation kinetics as depicted in fig. 1 and

fig. 1. binding kinetics of [3h]ucb 30889 in human cerebral cortex and cho
cells expressing the recombinant  xxxg2233xxx  protein. the binding kinetics were
measured as described in “materials and methods”. data presented are representative of three separate experiments. the curves are the best fits obtained with
equations describing the interaction of a ligand with two independent sites. the
dissociation kinetic in cerebral cortex and  xxxg2233xxx  in cho cells have been plotted
respectively as starting at 90 and 150 min for clarity. all dissociation kinetics
were induced after 120 min incubation. calculated kinetic constants for the
different brain regions and in cho cells are summarized in table 1.

the binding kinetic constants of [3h]ucb 30889 were calculated by non-linear
regression analysis of data from experiments such as depicted in fig. 1 and according to equations provided by prism® software describing the interactions of a
ligand with two independent sites (reported here as the slow and fast components). the results are the mean ± s.d. from three separate experiments performed at 4 °c. koff is the dissociation kinetic constant and kobs = konl + koff where
kon is the association kinetic constant and l is the concentration of radioligand
(2 nm in our experiments). t1/2 is the half time for dissociation or association.

reported in table 1. the fast component for both association and
dissociation had a half-time ranging from 1 to 4 min and
represented from 30% to 36% of the sites in association
experiments and from 33% to 49% in dissociation experiments.
the half-times of the slow component ranged from 20 to 41 min.
the dissociation half-time for the slow component in the
cerebellum was shorter (p < 0.01) than in the other brain regions
or in cho cell membranes expressing  xxxg2233xxx .

with increasing concentrations of [3h]ucb 30889 for 120 min at 4 °c. nonspecific binding (nsb) was determined as the residual binding observed in the
presence of 1 mm  xxxd2466xxx . the specific binding is obtained after
subtraction of the nsb from the total binding. results are representative of 4 to
8 experiments.

a high affinity binding site (around 30% of the total number of
sites) for [3h]ucb 30889 with a kd value of 25 to 30 nm and a
low affinity binding site with a kd value between 190 and
270 nm (see table 2).
3.3. competition experiments

saturation curves of [3h]ucb 30889 were performed as explained in “ materials
and methods”. scatchard plots and saturation curves were analysed according a
one-site model by linear and non-linear regression respectively. the saturation
curves leading to curvilinear scatchard plots (as depicted in fig. 2) have been
analyzed by non-linear regression using a two-site model as described in
“ materials and methods”. the data are expressed as mean ± s.d. (n = 3 to 8).

3.2. saturation curves

we have determined the affinity of several  xxxd2466xxx 
analogues for  xxxg2233xxx  in human brain and in cho cell
membranes expressing the recombinant protein. we have also
selected additional compounds that have previously been shown
to bind to  xxxg2233xxx  in rat brain, including pentylenetetrazol,
bemegride and chlordiazepoxide. the results are shown in
fig. 4 for human cerebral cortex and for recombinant  xxxg2233xxx  and
are reported in table 3. the binding is highly stereoselective in
all tissues as demonstrated by the affinity of  xxxd2466xxx  being
1000-fold higher than that of its enantiomer l060. as shown in
fig. 5 the correlation between the affinities of the compounds
measured not only in different human brain regions but also in

saturation isotherms showed that [3h]ucb 30889 bound with
high affinity to  xxxg2233xxx  in the three brain regions investigated as
well as in cho cell membranes expressing  xxxg2233xxx  (see fig. 2 for
curves obtained in human cerebral cortex and cho cell
membranes expressing the recombinant  xxxg2233xxx ). the specific
binding of [3h]ucb 30889 was close to 95% of the total binding
at concentrations near the kd value. analysis of these saturation
curves according to one homogeneous population of binding
sites gave kd values for [3h]ucb 30889 from 53 to 75 nm and
bmax values around 3.0 to 3.5 pmol/mg of proteins in all tissues
(table 2). about half the saturation curves, independently of the
tissue, gave curvilinear scatchard plots (see fig. 3). analysis of
these curves according to two independent binding sites showed

fig. 3. [3h]ucb 30889 scatchard plots in human cerebral cortex and cho cells
expressing the recombinant  xxxg2233xxx  protein. saturation curves as depicted in fig.
2 were transformed into scatchard plots. two typical sets of data are presented in
each tissue (open and closed symbols). approximately 50% of the saturation
curves in each tissue, including cho cells, yielded curvilinear scatchard plots.
the fitted lines were obtained using the values of kd and bmax of the high and
low affinity sites as calculated by non-linear regression of the saturation curves
according to a two-site model as proposed in prism® software. the values
obtained are summarized in table 2.

fig. 4. affinity of selected compounds for  xxxg2233xxx  in human cerebral cortex and

increasing concentrations with 1.5 nm of [3h]ucb 30889 for 120 min at 4 °c as
described in “materials and methods”. the data shown were normalized and are
the average of three independent experiments. s.d. was in the range of 5% to
10% of the mean but was omitted in the graph for clarity. the pki obtained from
the analysis of untransformed raw data by non-linear regression with prism®
software according to a model with variable slope are reported in table 3.

results are the mean ± s.d. from three independent experiments performed on
brain samples from different donors. data from competition curves such as
depicted in fig. 4 were analysed by non-linear regression and pic50 values were
corrected to pki as explained in “ materials and methods”. hill coefficients were
not different from unity (ranging from 0.8 to 1.2).

rat brain in comparison with their affinity for recombinant
human  xxxg2233xxx  is excellent. in absolute terms, the correlation
lines are shifted slightly to the left of the perfect correlation,
indicating that the affinity for recombinant  xxxg2233xxx  is, on average,
2- to 4-fold lower compared to the values observed in human or
rat brain.
4. discussion
the antiepileptic drug  xxxd2466xxx  has been shown to bind
to a specific binding site in rat brain (noyer et al., 1995; gillard
et al., 2003). this binding site has been identified as the  xxxg2233xxx 
protein, a protein ubiquitously distributed in the central nervous
system as a component of synaptic vesicles (lynch et al., 2004).
in our study, we aimed to extend these observations by studying
more in depth the binding properties of [3h]ucb 30889 in cho
cells stably expressing the human recombinant  xxxg2233xxx  and in
human brain regions and to compare the results with those
obtained previously in rat brain. our results show that the
binding characteristics of [3h]ucb 30889 to human recombinant
 xxxg2233xxx  and to native  xxxg2233xxx  expressed in all the investigated
human brain regions are similar. [3h]ucb 30889 binds in a
biphasic manner in all tissue examined with a fast component
representing 30% to 50% of the sites. the kinetic constants were
comparable between human brain regions and recombinant
 xxxg2233xxx  with the notable exception of the slowly dissociating
component in the cerebellum which is faster in that tissue (t1/2 of
20 min compared to 30–40 min in other regions). similar
biphasic kinetics for [3h]ucb 30889 were already reported in rat
brain (gillard et al., 2003) but the dissociation kinetic constants
of the slow component were lower in rat than in human brain (t1/2
of 60 to 80 min in rat compared to 20 to 40 min in human).
in addition to biphasic kinetics, we also observed, in all brain
regions as well as in cho cells, curvilinear scatchard plots
describing high and low affinity binding sites. the occurrence
of curvilinear scatchard plots did not depend on the membrane

preparation nor on the identity of the donor since membranes
from the same human donor would one time give a linear
scatchard plot while the next time it would be a biphasic plot.
similarly, during parallel testing, some preparations would yield
biphasic curves while others would give straight lines. we did
observe similar results in rat brain but until now we had favored
the simplest model of a homogeneous population of binding
sites mainly because the saturation curves were obtained by
isotopic dilutions at concentrations of [3h]ucb 30889 above
35 nm. indeed, in such an experimental design, mathematical
simulations indicated that the shape of the scatchard plot curve
is quite sensitive to the accuracy of both the radioligand specific
activity and the concentration of the stock solution of the cold
ligand used to construct the isotopic dilutions. however, the
increasing number of experiments made in different tissues and
species along with the fact that both the specific activity and the
concentrations of stock solutions have been carefully checked,
led us to reanalyse those results. more likely, the fact that the
ratio of affinity between the high and low affinity sites for [3h]
ucb 30889 was less or equal to 10 could explain why this
observation was not systematic. indeed, there is a need for a
right blend between proportions of high and low affinity sites
and the ratio of affinity of a radioligand for these sites in order to
be able to distinguish them unambiguously at equilibrium (de
lean et al., 1982). in this case (a selectivity ratio of 8 to 10 in
affinity and a proportion of high affinity sites of 20–30%), the
model of de lean et al. (1982) predicts that 50% of the
experiments would result in a statistically significant two sites
analysis.
to address the question of whether high and low affinity sites
could be paired to the fast and slow binding kinetic components,
we performed a saturation curve (data not shown) using a
10 min incubation period which would allow approaching

fig. 5. correlation between the affinities of selected compounds for  xxxg2233xxx  in
human brain, rat brain and cho cells expressing the human recombinant protein.
pki obtained for compounds as reported in table 3 for human brain regions and
as reported in gillard et al. (2003) for rat brain was plotted against the pki
obtained for recombinant human  xxxg2233xxx  expressed in cho cells (table 3). linear
regression was applied to calculate the correlations. the dotted line represents a
perfect correlation with a slope of 1.0 and passing through the origin.

steady-state binding of the fast equilibrating sites while limiting
the labeling of the slowly equilibrating sites to a minimum.
under these conditions the saturation curves led to a kd of
200 nm, a value close to the kd value of the low affinity sites
(table 2). on the other hand, we also did a saturation curve
where a 4-h incubation period to allow complete equilibrium
was followed by a 15 min dissociation induced by an excess of
unlabelled  xxxd2466xxx  to eliminate sites with fast kinetics.
this presumes that the remaining labeled sites possess slow
dissociation kinetics. under these conditions, the scatchard plot
revealed a single population of sites with a kd of 35 nm, a value
comparable with the 25 to 28 nm calculated for the high affinity
sites. from these combined experiments it appears that the high
affinity sites may have slow association and dissociation
kinetics and that the low affinity sites may be endowed with
fast kinetics.
biphasic saturation curves and/or binding kinetics may be
the consequence, for example, of ligand induced binding site
isomerization, binding site interconversion, binding site heterogeneity or cooperativity between sites. given the fact that
some of the saturation curves led to curvilinear scatchard plots
with high and low affinity binding sites, it is tempting to
speculate about the existence of distinct binding sites, especially
since we know that there are three  xxxg2233xxx  isoforms (a, b and c).
however, the following combined observations led us to
discard the hypothesis of site heterogeneity in terms of different
proteins/isoforms: [3h]ucb 30889 does not bind to recombinant
sv2b and c isoforms and its binding is totally abrogated in
 xxxg2233xxx  knock-out mice brain indicating that  xxxg2233xxx  is the only
binding protein for this ligand (lynch et al., 2004). in addition,
biphasic kinetics and saturation curves are also observed in
cho cells expressing only the  xxxg2233xxx  protein (in untransfected
cho cells specific [3h]ucb 30889 binding is absent).  xxxg2233xxx 
proteins are known to interact with partners such as synaptotagmin (schivell et al., 2005) and thus biphasic kinetics and
scatchard plots observed in brain may be the consequence of
binding to  xxxg2233xxx  alone or in combination with other proteins.
depending on the identity of the partner, one may have
differences in the binding kinetics such as observed in human
cerebellum vs hippocampus or cortex. however, this hardly
explains biphasic kinetics and scatchard plots in cho cells
where the synaptic protein partners of  xxxg2233xxx  are absent. in this
case, heterogeneity is more likely to arise from the formation of
homodimers or homooligomers, a phenomenon that is increasingly reported for other members of the major facilitator
superfamily (geertsma et al., 2005) as well as for other proteins
such as g-protein coupled receptors (rios et al., 2001).
alternatively, the coexistence of different post-translational
forms of the protein in terms of glycosylation and/or
phosphorylation is also a possibility. regarding this last
hypothesis, variable levels of  xxxg2233xxx  glycosylation have been
suggested to account for the heterogeneous pattern of protein
expression observed by immunocytochemistry in cos-7 cells
expressing the recombinant protein as well as in rodent brain
(feany et al., 1992; lynch et al., 2004). finally, site
interconversion between high and low affinity states or even
multiple binding sites on a single  xxxg2233xxx  protein cannot be

107

excluded. further investigation will be needed to sort out these
hypotheses.
compounds that are known to bind to  xxxg2233xxx  in rat brain also
bound with the same affinities in human brain. so far, we have
not found any ligand displaying significant species selectivity.
however, in cho cells, the compounds systematically bind
with 2- to 4-fold less affinity compared to human brain. the
same arguments set forth to explain site heterogeneity may
apply to the difference in affinity between  xxxg2233xxx  in brain and
expressed in cho cells. in addition, a different lipid/protein
environment and/or a different ph gradient in cho cells
compared to synaptic vesicles may also contribute to slight
changes in affinity. the binding curves in competition
experiments did not reveal the existence of the multiple binding
sites as observed with [3h]ucb 30889. this indicates that the
ligands tested so far are non-selective or poorly selective with
respect to the different sites.
in conclusion, the recombinant  xxxg2233xxx  protein expressed in
cho cells and natively expressed  xxxg2233xxx  in human brain share
very similar binding characteristics in terms of ligand affinity
and even binding kinetics, making the recombinant system quite
suitable for use in discovery efforts to find new  xxxg2233xxx  ligands.
our results with [3h]ucb 30889 also strongly suggest the
existence of multiple forms of the protein but all ligands tested
so far showed no or poor selectivity for these different forms.
further investigation is clearly needed to identify the nature of
these multiple forms but various patterns of glycosylation and/
or the formation of homodimers are among plausible candidates. in addition, in brain tissue, heterogeneity due to
interactions between  xxxg2233xxx  and partners such as synaptotagmin
should not be excluded and this latter hypothesis could be tested
by coexpression studies in cho cells. the characteristics of
 xxxg2233xxx  in human brain and rat brain are equivalent in terms of
compound affinity and site density (despite the 4 to 6 h delay in
post-mortem human brain processing) but they do differ slightly
in terms of binding kinetics. the homology between human, rat
and even mice (lynch et al., 2004)  xxxg2233xxx  increases the
confidence in the results obtained in animal models of epilepsy
used to evaluate compounds interacting with  xxxg2233xxx .
