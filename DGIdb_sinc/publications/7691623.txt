the binding of the antipsychotic drugs risperidone, (+)-butaclamol, clozapine, haloperidol, spiperone, thioridazine and
ym-09151-2 was studied at the subtypes of the al-adrenoceptor. saturation experiments showed that [3h] xxxd3000xxx  labelled a
single population of binding sites in the spleen (alb) and hippocampus (aja and alb) (dissociation constants (ko): 0.26 nm and
0.14 nm respectively).  xxxd3000xxx  displaced the radioligand in a monophasic manner in both the spleen and hippocampus whereas
5-methyl-urapidil,  xxxd2914xxx  and wb 4101 displaced the radioligand in a monophasic manner in the spleen but in a biphasic
manner in the hippocampus. the affinity of these three compounds for the low affinity site in the hippocampus was similar to
that observed in the spleen, suggesting that all three were selective for the aln-adrenoceptor. furthermore, the affinities for the
aim- and alb-adrenoceptors calculated in this manner were in agreement with literature values. with the exception of
risperidone, all the antipsychotic drugs tested failed to show selectivity for either of the al-adrenoceptor subtypes. risperidone
was 120-fold more selective for the am-adrenoceptor with respect to the cqa-adrenoceptor (k i values: 2.3 + 1.2 nm and
283.6 + 174.1 nm respectively).

1. introduction

evidence from both radioligand binding and functional studies suggests that al-adrenoceptors can be
subdivided into a number of subtypes of which at least
two subclasses termed ala-adrenoceptors and a~badrenoceptors have been pharmacologically characterised by radioligand binding (for review see minneman, 1988; bylund, 1992). both adrenoceptor subtypes
are found in various regions of the brain including the
hippocampus (wilson and minneman, 1989) and are
found in peripheral tissues, with the rat submaxillary
gland expressing a homogeneous population of alnadrenoceptors and the rat liver and spleen expressing
homogeneous populations of am-adrenoceptors (michel et al., 1989; veenstra et al., 1992).
the therapeutic activity of antipsychotic drugs is
thought to be related to dopamine receptor blockade
(davis et al., 1991). a number of antipsychotic drugs,
however, also have high affinities for the al-adreno-

ceptor and it has been suggested that interactions with
this receptor may play an important role in their clinical efficacy (cohen and lipinski, 1986; baldessarini et
al., 1992).
the present study was undertaken to examine the
possible selectivity of a variety of antipsychotic drugs
for either of the two subtypes of the central al-adrenoceptor. affinities for both the ala-adrenoceptors
and the atb-adrenoceptors were estimated in the rat
hippocampus by analysing displacement curves with
l i g a n d (munson and rodbard, 1980; mcpherson,
1985) with both one- and two-site analysis. if a drug is
selective for one subtype of the al-adrenoceptor with
respect to the other then it should produce a biphasic
displacement of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  from hippocampal membranes; because the affinity for the am-adrenoceptor
can be estimated from experiments in the rat spleen,
the affinity for the ala-adrenoceptor can be deduced.
to examine the validity of this approach, the alaadrenoceptor selective compounds,  xxxd2914xxx , 5methyl-urapidil and wb 4101 (2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)aminomethyl-l,4-benzodioxane) (morrow and
creese, 1986), and the nonselective compound  xxxd3000xxx , were studied in hippocampal and in spleen
preparations.

2. materials and methods

binding assays were performed with m e m b a n e s obtained from either rat hippocampus or rat spleen.
frozen brains of male sprague-dawley rats (iffa credo,
france) were used for hippocampal preparations. rat
spleens were obtained fresh from male sprague-dawley rats (iffa credo, france), killed by decapitation.
prior to homogenisation, the spleens were cut into 350
/xm slices using a mcllwain tissue chopper to facilitate
m e m b r a n e preparation.
following dissection, the tissues were homogenised
in 20 volumes of ice-cold sorenson buffer ( n a + / k +
phosphate 66.6 mm, p h 7.4). the homogenates were
centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min and the supernatents recovered and recentrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10
min. the pellets were then resuspended in the same
volume of an 'incubation buffer' consisting of tris-hc1
(50 mm, p h 7.4) incorporating 140 m m naci and 5
m m mgci 2. the suspensions were then centrifuged at
30,000 × g for 10 min and the pellets resuspended in
the incubation buffer so that the final tissue concentrations were 5 m g / m l and 8 m g / m l for hippocampal and
spleen preparations respectively.
a l - a d r e n o c e p t o r s were labelled in both tissues using
[3h] xxxd3000xxx . non-specific binding was measured in
the presence of 1 / x m  xxxd2914xxx  and specific binding defined as total binding minus non-specific binding.
saturation studies were p e r f o r m e d in both tissues with
the concentration of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  varying from 0.032 to
4 nm in the hippocampus and from 0.001 to 7 nm in
the spleen.
displacement studies consisted of 0.1 ml [3h] xxxd3000xxx  (final concentrations 0.25 nm and 0.1 nm in
the hippocampal and spleen preparations respectively),
0.1 ml of test compound or buffer and 0.8 ml of
m e m b r a n e preparation. displacement curves were constructed with 15 concentrations of each drug in hippocampal preparations and 8 concentrations in spleen
preparations (displacement curves with a~-adrenocep-

tor ligands were constructed with 15 concentrations in
each preparation).  xxxd2914xxx , wb 4101, 5-methylurapidil and  xxxd3000xxx  were studied as reference drugs
to determine whether the present approach would yield
valid estimates of ala-adrenoceptor and oqb-adrenoceptor affinities. subsequently, the following antipsychotic drugs were then studied in both tissues: spiperone, haloperidol, (+)-butaclamol, melperone, clozapine, risperidone and thioridazine. the assay tubes were
incubated for 60 min at 37°c after which time the
incubation was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of
the incubation buffer containing 1 /zm  xxxd2914xxx 
followed by rapid filtration over w h a t m a n g f / c filters. these filters were then washed with 2 × 3 ml of
incubation buffer. the radioactivity retained on the
filters was measured by scintillation spectroscopy in 4
ml of scintillation fluid (emulsifier safe, packard). all
experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated
at least 3 times.
the dissociation constant and the total number of
binding sites (k d and bmax respectively) in each tissue
were estimated by scatchard analysis of the saturation
data. the affinity constants of all compounds were
estimated from the results of displacement experiments
that were analysed using the non-linear regression prog r a m m e e b d a / l i g a n d . this analysis assumes that
the hill coefficient does not differ from unity. d a t a
from displacement experiments were analysed with
both one-site and two-site models and the calculated f
ratios were used to determine whether a two-site model
fitted the data significantly better than a one-site model.
d a t a analysis was performed on each separate displacement curve. k i values are given as mean + s.e.m.,
of 3 - 5 experiments. the reported f and p values were
calculated by simultaneous analysis of replicated experiments for each drug. when statistical significance was
observed in the overall simultaneous analysis, it was
also observed for each separate displacement curve.

saturation experiments using [3h] xxxd3000xxx  as the
radioligand suggested that [3h] xxxd3000xxx  labelled a single population of receptors in both the rat hippocampus and in the rat spleen. the dissociation constant of
[3h] xxxd3000xxx  was similar in the hippocampus and the
spleen (0.26 nm and 0.14 nm respectively). the total
number of oq-adrenoceptors in the hippocampus and
spleen was 6.03 fmol/mg tissue and 7.19 fmol/mg
tissue, respectively. the affinities of a~-adrenoceptor
ligands for the al-adrenoceptors in hippocampus and
spleen are given in table 1. in agreement with data
from saturation experiments,  xxxd3000xxx  displaced [3h] xxxd3000xxx  in a monophasic manner with similar affinities
in the hippocampus and spleen. 5-methyl-urapidil, wb
4101 and  xxxd2914xxx  displaced [3h] xxxd3000xxx  in a
monophasic manner from rat spleen membranes; analysis of the displacement data obtained with hippocampal membranes, however, revealed that a two-site fit
was significantly better than a one-site fit. at the low
affinity site in the hippocampus 5-methyl-urapidil,
 xxxd2914xxx  and wb 4101 had k i values similar to

those at the t~m-adrenoceptor in the spleen. in all
cases in the hippocampus, when biphasic displacement
curves were obtained approximately 50% of the sites
represented the high affinity site and 50% the low
affinity site. this data is in agreement with published
data (wilson and minneman, 1989).
each of the antipsychotic drugs displaced [3h] xxxd3000xxx  from the spleen membranes in a monophasic
manner (table 2). all drugs, with the exception of
risperidone, displaced [3h] xxxd3000xxx  from hippocampal
membranes in a monophasic manner with a two-site fit
of the data not being significantly better than a one-site
fit. the affinities of each of these compounds for
aradrenoceptors in hippocampal membranes were in
close agreement with those observed in the spleen.
risperidone, however, displaced [3h] xxxd3000xxx  from
hippocampal membranes in a biphasic manner with a
two-site fit of the data being significantly better than a
one-site fit (table 2). the k i value for risperidone at
the high affinity site in hippocampus was similar to its
k i value at the alb-adrenoceptor in spleen.

it was the purpose of the present study to examine
the possible selectivity of a variety of antipsychotic
drugs for either of the subtypes of the al-adrenoce ptor. the rat spleen was used to estimate the affinities
of the compounds at the ala-adrenoceptor (michel et
al., 1989; veenstra et al., 1992) while affinities for both
the a~a-adrenoceptor and ~m-adrenoceptor were estimated using hippocampal membranes (wilson and

son, 1985) with both one- and two-site analysis. if a
drug is selective for one subtype of the a v a d r e n o c e p tor with respect to the other then it should produce a
biphasic displacement of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  from hippocampal membranes; because the affinity for the a m - a d r e noceptor can be estimated from experiments in the rat
spleen, the affinity for the aja-adrenoceptor can be
deduced.
to examine the validity of this approach,  xxxd3000xxx ,
5-methyl-urapidil,  xxxd2914xxx  and wb 4101 were
tested. all four drugs displaced [3h] xxxd3000xxx  from
spleen m e m b r a n e s in a monophasic manner.  xxxd3000xxx 
displaced [3h] xxxd3000xxx  from hippocampal m e m b r a n e s
in a monophasic manner with an affinity similar to that
observed in spleen membranes.  xxxd2914xxx , 5methyl-urapidil and wb 4101, however, displaced
[3h] xxxd3000xxx  from hippocampal m e m b r a n e s in a biphasic manner. because the spleen expresses only a madrenoceptors (veenstra et al., 1992), the low affinity
sites in the hippocampus are likely to be a m - a d r e n o ceptors. thus, the present approach suggests these
compounds to be selective for ala-adrenoceptors, in
agreement with the previous observations (morrow and
creese, 1986; bylund, 1992; veenstra et al., 1992).
furthermore, their affinities for the two adrenoceptor
subtypes were in a g r e e m e n t - w i t h literature values
(morrow and creese, 1986; bylund, 1992; veenstra et
al., 1992).
all antipsychotic drugs that were tested, with the
exception of risperidone, displaced [3h] xxxd3000xxx  from
both hippocampal and spleen m e m b r a n e s in a
monophasic m a n n e r indicating that they are not selective for either of the subtypes of the al-adrenoceptor.
risperidone, however, displaced [3h] xxxd3000xxx  from
hippocampal m e m b r a n e s in a biphasic manner. the
affinity of risperidone for the high affinity site in the
hippocampus was similar to its affinity in the spleen.
this suggests that risperidone is about 120-fold selective for the a m - a d r e n o c e p t o r . the only other report of
an a m - a d r e n o c e p t o r selective compound, antipsychotic
or otherwise, was that of spiperone, which was found
to be 12.5-fold selective for the alb-adrenoceptor
(michel et al., 1989). in the present study, spiperone
did not show selectivity for either of the a v a d r e n o c e p tors. a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that
the present methodology may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a selectivity of this magnitude. alternatively, since michel et al. (1989) used peripheral tissue,
this discrepancy may reflect a difference between peripheral a v a d r e n o c e p t o r s and those in the central
nervous system.
the present data suggest that clinically active antipsychotic agents have high affinity for the alb-adrenoceptor and that risperidone is selective for the atbadrenoceptor with respect to the a~a-adrenoceptor.
because clinical efficacy has been demonstrated for

risperidone in the treatment of chronic schizophrenic
inpatients (claus et al., 1992), it is interesting to speculate on the clinical roles of these a l - a d r e n o c e p t o r
subtypes in the treatment of schizophrenia. the present data are consistent with the hypothesis that a 1adrenoceptors are involved in the clinical effects of
antipsychotics (cohen et al., 1986; baldessarini et al.,
1992) and suggest that it is the a m - a d r e n o c e p t o r subtype which is the most important since all the antipsychotics tested had high affinity for the alu-adrenoceptor subtype. it has also been suggested that risperidone
has a lower propensity to induce extrapyramidal side
effects c o m p a r e d to other antipsychotics (claus et al.,
1992) and its selectivity for a m - a d r e n o c e p t o r s may be a
possible candidate for explaining such differences.
