abstract
the blockade of platelet glycoprotein iib±iiia
( xxxg1202xxx ±iiia) was recently introduced as a new
antiplatelet strategy. at present, various  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia inhibitors are available to treat patients with
acute coronary syndrome or when undergoing
percutaneous coronary interventions. the current study systematically evaluates the antiplatelet effects of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia inhibitors in clinical use.
using conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies [ligand-induced binding sites (libs-1),
pmi-1] and flow cytometry, we showed that the
 xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists  xxxd53xxx , integrelin,
lamifiban, and  xxxd3385xxx , but not emd 122347 or
ym 337, induced libs activity of platelet  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia. the libs activity of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists
correlates with a proaggregatory response of
fixed platelets pretreated with  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists (intrinsic activity). all tested  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia
antagonists completely inhibit concentration-dependent adp (20 mmol/l)-induced aggregation.
in contrast, substantial trap (25 mmol/l)-in-

duced platelet aggregation still occurs even at
high inhibitor concentrations of the tested
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists. in addition, we show
that  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists are poor inhibitors of
platelet release reaction (atp and  xxxg2049xxx 
secretion) especially when strong agonists such
as trap are used to activate platelets. inhibition
of platelet procoagulant activity (thrombin generation) by  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists is dependent
on the type and concentration of antagonists and
on the strength of stimulus (thrombin, tissue
factor) used to induce platelet-dependent thrombin generation. the present data show that
significant pharmacological differences exist between  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists that may have
consequences for antithrombotic strategies and
for future drug development. d 2001 elsevier

nificantly [2]. recent clinical trials have established that a new class of antiplatelet drugs,
which compete for the fibrinogen binding site,
the glycoprotein iib ± iiia ( xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia) antagonists, reduces thrombotic complication in acute
coronary syndromes even more effectively than
aspirin alone [3±6].  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia is the inducible
fibrinogen receptor that plays a fundamental role
in platelet aggregation, and therefore, in arterial
thrombosis [7±9]. approximately 80 000 copies of
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia exist on the surface of unstimulated
platelets and bind soluble fibrinogen exclusively
in its activated form [7±9]. distinct amino acid
sequences such as rgd or kqagdv that are
present in the fibrinogen molecule sequence mediate this ligand±receptor interaction and bind to
specific extracellular regions of the  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia
complex [7±9]. rgd- and kqagdv-containing
peptides compete for the fibrinogen binding site
and are powerful inhibitors of fibrinogen binding
to  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia [7 ± 9]. various antagonists of
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia (e.g.  xxxd53xxx ,  xxxd3385xxx , integrilin,
and lamifiban) have been developed in the past
and have been studied in a variety of clinical
settings [4±6]. although all these antagonists
have been shown to be effective in reducing
thrombotic complications after coronary angioplasty or in acute coronary syndromes [4±6],
their clinical effects are variable and dependent
on the type of antagonist. although all  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia antagonists that are currently in clinical use
are potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation,
they differ from each other in respect to molecular design (antibody, peptide, peptidomimetic) and in important pharmacological
properties that might contribute to their variant
clinical effectiveness.
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of clinically relevant  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia
antagonists ( xxxd53xxx ,  xxxd3385xxx , integrelin,
lamifiban, emd 122347, ym 337) on various
aspects of platelet function including induction
of ligand-induced binding sites (libs) and
proaggregatory effects, deaggregation, release
reaction, and platelet-dependent induction
thrombin generation. the present data show
that significant pharmacological differences
exist between  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists that may
have consequences for therapy and for future
drug development.

1. methods
1.1. monoclonal antibodies, reagents, and
cell culture
the following mabs were used as purified igg:
anti-cd42 (clone sz 2), which is directed against
gpib, was obtained as phycoerythrin-conjugate,
and anti- xxxg2049xxx  (clone clbthromb/6), which
binds to  xxxg2049xxx  present on the surface of
degranulated platelets, was purchased as fitcconjugate from immunotech, marseille, france.
pmi-1 (anti-aiib heavy chain, residues 844±859)
[10] and anti-libs-1 (anti-b3) [10] were generously donated by dr. mark h. ginsberg (scripps
research institute) and were used as fitc-conjugates. currently, three types of  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia
antagonists are under clinically investigation:
(a)  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia-blocking monoclonal antibodies
( xxxd53xxx , ym 337), (b) synthetic peptides that contain rgd or kgd sequences derived from disintegrins of snake venoms (integrelin,
lamifiban), and (c) synthetic non-peptides that
mimic structure of the rgd/kgd motif ( xxxd3385xxx , emd 122347). the mouse/human chimeric
fab  xxxd53xxx  (reopro,  xxxd53xxx ) [4] was purchased
from lilly-deutschland (bad homburg, germany), and ym 337 was obtained from yamanouchi [11]. lamifiban [12] was from hoffman
laroche (basel, switzerland),  xxxd3385xxx  (mk383,
 xxxd3385xxx ) [13] from merck (west point, usa),
integrelin (integrilin,  xxxd2017xxx ) [14] from cor
therapeutics (san francisco, usa), and emd
122347, a peptido-mimetic antagonist, was generously provided by merck (darmstadt, germany). the peptide grgdsp, the g-chain
peptide hhlggakqagdv ( xxxg1956xxx ), the thrombin
substrate s-2238 (h- d -phe-pip-arg-nh-no 2 2hcl), the platelet agonist adp, and trap
(sfllrn-nh 2 ) were from sigma. a stable
cho cell line (a5) expressing the functional
human recombinant  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia receptor was
kindly provided by dr. mark ginsberg and
cultivated as described previously [15].
1.2. libs induction measurements and
flow cytometry
preparation of platelet-rich plasma (prp) and
isolated platelets was performed as described

t. dickfeld et al./thrombosis research 101 (2001) 53±64

[16]. the gel-filtered platelets were suspended in
the modified tyrode's buffer containing 1mmol/l cacl2 and 1-mmol/l mgcl2.
the effect of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists on libs
activity and on  xxxg2049xxx  degranulation was
measured as described previously [16±18].
1.3. platelet aggregation and luminometry
platelet aggregation was evaluated by optical
aggregometry in citrated prp samples at 37°c
using a two-channel chronolog aggregometer
(nobis, germany) as described [17]. the final
platelet count was adjusted to 2  108 platelets/
ml with autologous plasma. after adjustment of
the baseline, 5 ml of adp (final concentration 20
mmol/l) or trap (25 mmol/l) was added, and
aggregation was recorded for 5 min in the
absence or presence of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists
in concentrations as indicated. simultaneously,
release of atp was recorded using the firefly

55

luminometer method [17]. to evaluate the effect
of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists on deaggregation, platelet aggregation in prp was induced by addition of adp (20 mmol/l) or trap (25 mmol/l).
after peak aggregation response,  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia
antagonists were added in concentrations that
inhibit trap-induced aggregation half-maximally (see fig. 4). to test whether  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia
antagonists induce proaggregatory effects, gelfiltered platelets pretreated with 200-ng/ml
 xxxd124xxx  were incubated with inhibitors for 30
min and fixed with a fixative that contains
methacroleine [19]. the fixative was washed
off, and platelets were resuspended in modified
tyrode's buffer at a final concentration of
2  10 8 /ml. aggregation was induced after
addition of 1-mg/ml fibrinogen, 1-mmol/l
cacl2, and 1-mmol/l mgcl2 at 1000 rpm as
described [20,21]. similarly, aggregation of
cho- xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia transfectants (a5 cells) was
evaluated with fixed cells after pretreatment

fig. 1. effects of  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists on induction of libs on platelets. gel-filtrated platelets were incubated in the
presence of 200 ng/ml  xxxd124xxx  with the  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists grgdsp (0 ± 2 mm), integrelin (0 ± 4 mg/ml),  xxxd53xxx  (0 ± 100
mg/ml, emd 122347 (0 ± 3, 6 mg/ml),  xxxd3385xxx  (0 ± 250 ng/ml), lamifiban (0 ± 1 mg/ml),  xxxg1956xxx  (g-chain peptide kqagdv; 0 ±
2 mm), and ym 337 (0 ± 100 mg/ml) in a (a and c) concentration (15-min incubation time)- or (b and d) time-dependent
manner. the concentrations of antagonists used in these experiments are indicated in fig. 4. to assess the effect of
incubation time on libs induction, platelets were treated with concentrations of  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists that revealed
half-maximal inhibition of trap (25 mmol/l)-induced platelet aggregation (ic50-[trap]; see fig. 4). induction of libs
was assessed with conformation-dependent mabs (libs1, pmi-1) and flow cytometry. abscissa indicates percentage of
libs induction compared with baseline values (no antagonist present). depicted are the representative results of five
independently performed experiments.

fig. 2. agglutination of fixed platelets pretreated with
 xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists. gel-filtered platelets (2  108
cells/ml) were incubated with ic50-[trap] lamifiban,
integrelin,  xxxd3385xxx , and emd 122347 for 30 min at room
temperature. after fixation (see methods) and subsequent washing, platelet agglutination was initiated by
the addition of 1-mg/ml fibrinogen, 1-mmol/l cacl2,
and 1-mmol/l mgcl2. representative tracing curves.

constant agitation as described [15].
1.4. platelet-dependent thrombin generation
the assay for thrombin generation was performed as described [22]. in brief, 0.5 ml of
prp with adjusted platelet count (2  108/ml)
was placed in a polypropylene tube, and 20 ml
of 1-mol/l cacl2 were added to start clotting in
the absence or presence of 0.2-u/ml a-thrombin or  xxxg748xxx . the final concentration of
 xxxg748xxx  was 1/10th of what is required to
clot ppp in approximately 80 s [28]. at time
intervals as indicated, 10 ml of the sample were
transferred into wells of a microtiter plate containing 90 ml of 3.8% sodium citrate. at the end
of the incubation time, 50 ml of the 0.5-mmol/l
thrombin substrate s-2238 (sigma) in 1-mol/l
tris, ph 8.1, were added, and the plate was
read kinetically for 60 min at a wavelength of
405 nm with reference wave length at 630 nm
on a dynatech mr5000 reader. the assay was
calibrated by testing known amounts of purified human thrombin in each assay. one unit
of thrombin per well yields a value of 25 mod
at 60 min. all measurements were performed
as triplicate.

fig. 3. aggregation of fixed  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia transfectants
pretreated with  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists. isolated cho
cells expressing the human recombinant  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia
receptor (1  106 cells/ml) were incubated with ic50[trap] lamifiban, integrelin,  xxxd3385xxx , and emd 122347
for 30 min at room temperature or with activating
monoclonal antibody libs-1 (described in ref. [15]).
after fixation to stabilize the conformation of  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia
and subsequent washing, aggregation was initiated by
the addition of 1-mg/ml fibrinogen, 1-mmol/l cacl2,
and 1-mmol/l mgcl2, and aggregation was performed
under constant agitation using a rotatory shaker. shown
are representative photomicrographs of aggregate formation. as positive control,  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia-expressing cho
cells were aggregated through addition of libs-1 mab
in the presence of fibrinogen (see ref. [15]). as negative
control, the behavior of aggregate formation of transfectants was studied in the absence of libs-1 mab
(without libs-1).

2. results
2.1. induction of libs and proaggregatory effects of
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists
integrelin,  xxxd53xxx ,  xxxd3385xxx , and lamifiban
induced libs-1 surface expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (fig. 1a
and b). in contrast, emd 122347 and ym 337
did not induce libs-1 activity and showed a
decrease in libs-1 expression when used in
higher concentrations (fig. 1). the libs induction was independent of the type of mab used
to monitor conformational change of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia
because similar results were found for the pmi1 mab (fig. 1c and d). when libs induction
was compared between antagonists at a concentration that inhibits trap-induced platelet
aggregation half-maximally (ic50-[trap]), highest signals were observed with  xxxd3385xxx  and
lamifiban, and lowest values were found with
emd 122347 and ym 337. to test the effects of
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists on libs induction independent of the platelet membrane environment
and intracellular activation mechanisms, we
used a stable cho cell line that expresses
human recombinant  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia. as described
for intact platelets, all tested compounds, except
emd 122347 and ym 337, induced substantial

deaggregation. aggregation of gel-filtered platelets
(2  108 cells/ml) was induced by adp (20 mmol/l; right
panel) or trap (25 mmol/l; left panel). after the
aggregation amplitude reached maximal values,
 xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia inhibitors were added to the platelet suspension in concentrations of ic50-[trap]. the representative
tracing curves of  xxxd53xxx  and emd 122347 are shown.

(2  108 cells/ml) were preincubated with various concentrations of  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists for 10 min. aggregation
was induced through addition of 20-mmol/l adp or 25-mmol/l trap. the representative results of four experiments
are shown.

2.2. effects of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists on adp- and
trap-induced platelet aggregation

fig. 6. effect of  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists on platelet
release reaction. the effect of  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists on
atp release was evaluated during (a) adp (20 mmol/
l)- and (b) trap (25 mmol/l)-induced aggregation using
firefly luminometry. experiments were performed in
the presence of  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists that inhibit
trap-induced platelet aggregation half-maximally
(ic50-[trap]).

[20,21]. to assess potential proaggregatory effects
of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists, agglutination of fixed
platelets pretreated with  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists
was evaluated in the presence of fibrinogen and
ca2 + and mg2 + . we found that pretreatment of
platelets with  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists at ic50[trap] (integrelin,  xxxd3385xxx , and lamifiban)
resulted in substantial aggregation response
(fig. 2). in contrast, under identical experimental
conditions, preincubation of platelets with emd
122347 that did not induce libs activity exhibited no substantial aggregation (fig. 2). for technical reasons, we were not able to include the
antibody-based inhibitors ( xxxd53xxx , ym 337) in these
analyses because the fixation procedure did not
allow to wash-off the antagonists from the platelet surface. similar aggregation experiments were
performed with stable transfectants expressing
the human  xxxg1202xxx ± iiia. as depicted in fig. 3,
preincubation of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia transfectants with
 xxxd3385xxx , lamifiban, and integrelin, but not with
emd 122347, resulted in aggregation of  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia transfectants.

as expected, all tested  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists
inhibited adp (20 mmol/l)-induced platelet
aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 4). at high antagonist concentrations,
adp (20 mmol/l)-induced aggregation was completely inhibited by all tested compounds (fig. 4).
in contrast, when trap (25 mmol/l) was used to
induce platelet aggregation, substantial less and
incomplete inhibition of platelet aggregation was
found with all tested antagonists (fig. 4). even at
high concentrations, none of the tested antagonists was able to completely inhibit trapinduced aggregation (fig. 4).
to test whether  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia inhibition can
result in deaggregation of already aggregated
platelets,  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists were added to
platelets after initiation of aggregation in concentrations that inhibited trap (25 mmol/l)-induced
aggregation half-maximally (ic50-[trap]; see

fig. 7. effect of  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists on surface
expression of  xxxg2049xxx . surface expression of  xxxg2049xxx 
was determined by flow cytometry on (a) adp (20
mmol/l)- or (b) trap-(25 mmol/l)-activated platelets. the
effect of antagonists was evaluated in concentrations that
inhibit trap (25 mmol/l)-induced platelet aggregation
half-maximally (see fig. 4).the results of four experiments are shown. * indicates significant differences
compared with grgdsp values ( p < .01).

fig. 4). none of the tested antagonists showed
any effect on deaggregation when platelet aggregation was induced by trap (25 mmol/l; fig. 5).
when similar experiments were performed with
adp (20 mmol/l) as agonist to induce platelet
aggregation, only the peptido-mimetic antagonist
emd 122347 (fig. 5), but not the other antagonists ( xxxd53xxx , lamifiban,  xxxd3385xxx , ym 337;
data not shown), were able to deaggregate adp
(20 mmol/l)-stimulated platelets.

59

2.3. effects of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists on platelet
release reaction
the effects of the antagonists on platelet granula
release were evaluated by measurements of atp
secretion (marker for dense granula release) and
surface expression of  xxxg2049xxx  (marker for agranula release). all tested antagonists at ic50[trap] inhibited atp release from adp (20
mmol/l)-activated platelets during aggregation

fig. 8. effect of  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists on platelet-dependent thrombin generation. prp was incubated in
polypropylene tubes with either a-thrombin (0.2 u/ml) or recombinant  xxxg748xxx  after recalcification aliquots were
sampled at the indicated time intervals and thrombin generation was determined as described in the methods. prp was
preincubated for 15 min with  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists in concentrations that inhibit (a and c) adp-(20 mmol/l)- or (b and
d) trap-(25 mmol/l)-induced aggregation half-maximally, and platelet-dependent thrombin generation was
determined after addition of (a and b) a-thrombin and (c and d)  xxxg748xxx . * indicates significant differences
( p < .01) compared with stimulated control values in the absence of inhibitors.

60

t. dickfeld et al./thrombosis research 101 (2001) 53±64

to a similar degree by approximately 80% (fig.
6a). when trap (25 mmol/l) was used to stimulate platelets, significantly less or no inhibition of
atp release was found depending on the type of
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia inhibitors present in the platelet suspension (fig. 6b). whereas, atp release was
inhibited by emd 122347,  xxxd3385xxx , and ym
337 by approximately 40%, no substantial inhibitory effects on trap-induced atp release were
found for  xxxd53xxx , integrelin, or lamifiban (fig. 6b).
when the effect of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists were
tested on activation-dependent surface expression of  xxxg2049xxx  (a-granula degranulation),
none of the tested antagonists, except emd
122347, did substantially inhibit  xxxg2049xxx  degranulation (fig. 7a and b).
2.4. effects of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists on
platelet-dependent thrombin generation
to determine the effect of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists
on platelet-dependent thrombin generation, prp
was pretreated with various antagonists before
initiation of thrombin generation through addition of thrombin or  xxxg748xxx  with 1-mmol/l
cacl2. concentrations of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists
were tested that inhibited adp (20 mmol/l)- or
trap (25 mmol/l)-induced aggregation halfmaximally (ic50-[trap] or ic50-[adp]; see fig.
4). when the effect of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia inhibitors was
tested at ic50-[adp], no substantial reduction of
platelet-dependent thrombin generation was
found compared with stimulated control values
in the absence of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia inhibitors (fig. 8a
and c). at higher inhibitor concentrations (ic50[trap]), integrelin,  xxxd53xxx , emd 122347, and  xxxd3385xxx  reduced  xxxg748xxx -induced thrombin
generation ( p < .01) compared with control
values. in contrast, only emd 122347 showed a
significant decrease in thrombin generation compared with control values when prp was stimulated with thrombin ( p < .01; fig. 8b and d).

3. discussion
the presented systematic comparison of  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia antagonists might help to improve antithrombotic strategies and development of novel
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia inhibitors.

the major findings of the present studies are
that currently used  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists
reveal substantial differences in important pharmacological antiplatelet properties. specifically,
(1) the majority of the tested  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists induces libs on their platelet receptor that
is associated with enhanced proaggregatory
activity. (2) all tested  xxxg1202xxx ± iiia antagonists
completely inhibit concentration-dependent
aggregation induced by adp (20 mmol/l). however, substantial trap (25 mmol/l)-induced platelet aggregation still occurs even at high
inhibitor concentrations of the tested  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia
antagonists. (3)  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists are poor
inhibitors of platelet release reaction (atp and
 xxxg2049xxx  secretion), especially when strong agonists such as trap are used to activate platelets.
(4) inhibition of platelet procoagulant activity by
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists was dependent on the
type of antagonists and on the strength of stimulus (thrombin,  xxxg748xxx ) used to induce
platelet-dependent thrombin generation.
3.1. intrinsic activating properties of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia
antagonists
in the past, a variety of antagonists of platelet
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia has been developed, and all of them
have been proven to be effective in reducing
thrombo-ischemic complications in patients
with acute coronary syndromes and in individuals undergoing coronary interventions [4±6].
although all  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists inhibit
fibrinogen binding to  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia and platelet
aggregation effectively, our experimental data
reveal significant pharmacological differences
that might be associated with variant clinical
efficacy in similar clinical settings.
in the present study, we found that the majority of the tested antagonists ( xxxd53xxx , integrelin,
 xxxd3385xxx , and lamifiban) induces libs expression
both on intact resting platelets and on recombinant human  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia. other tested antagonists,
emd 122347 and ym 337, however, did not
enhance libs expression. this indicates that
although all  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists compete with
fibrinogen for a common binding site on  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia, their binding characteristics to their receptor
and the subsequent effects on conformational
changes of the receptor are substantially differ-

t. dickfeld et al./thrombosis research 101 (2001) 53±64

ent. by causing libs induction,  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia
antagonists induce an active functional state of
their receptor that has proaggregatory effects
after dissociation of the antagonist [20,21]. our
studies confirm and extent these previous
reports that  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists can induce
proaggregatory effects [20,21]. we found that
proaggregatory effects of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists
correlate with their ability to induce libs signals. only  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists that induce
libs expression ( xxxd3385xxx , lamifiban, integrelin)
were able to agglutinate fixed platelets after the
antagonist had been removed; whereas,  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia inhibitors without libs-inducing activity
(emd 122347) did not reveal any proaggregatory effect. this proaggregatory effect of  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia antagonists is a consequence of direct interaction with their receptor independent of platelet-specific signaling events because it was also
observed with cells bearing the recombinant
human  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia in the absence of platelet
membrane microenvironment. for technical reasons, we were not able to evaluate the proaggregatory effect of the antibody inhibitors,  xxxd53xxx 
and ym 337, because we were unable to remove
the inhibitors after fixation of platelets before
performing aggregation. however, peter et al.
[21] showed that  xxxd53xxx  also reveals an proaggregatory effect when specific experimental conditions are applied. thus, most but not all of
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists can function as partial
agonists of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia as well as competitive
binding inhibitors that might be due to different
ligand-binding properties of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonist and libs induction potency.
3.2. release reaction
one consequence of intrinsic activating properties of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists might be that via
libs induction  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia inhibitors modulate
intracellular signal transduction events (outside
in signaling) involved in the release reaction of
activated platelets. recently, it was shown that
antagonists with libs activity augment thrombin-induced intracellular ca2 + increase [23].
because platelet release reaction is strongly
dependent on intracellular ca2 + concentration
[24], we evaluated the effect of  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia
antagonists on platelet granula release. we found

61

that  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists are poor inhibitors
of platelet release reaction. although all tested
antagonists substantially inhibit the release
reaction of adp-activated platelets, the inhibition on trap-induced degranulation was generally weak. interestingly, one antagonist, emd
122347, which does not exhibit libs-inducing
properties, showed some inhibition of trapinduced release. these findings suggest an
association between libs expression and
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia-mediated release reaction of platelets. this conclusion is supported furthermore
by recent published reports showing that  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia antagonists with libs activity also augment
an increase in intracellular [ca2 + ]i, which is
partially due to thromboxane a2 (txa2) production [23]; whereas, antagonists that do not show
libs activity do not affect thrombin-induced
[ca2 + ]i increase [23]. since platelets contain a
variety of releasable active compounds (vasoactive substances, cytokines, growth factors, and
adhesion molecules) that are involved in the
pathophysiology of microcirculation and restenosis, development of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia inhibitors with
no or less libs activity and enhanced release
blocking effects might be advantageous.
3.3.  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists and procoagulant
activity of platelets
platelets play a central role in the regulation of
coagulation [25]. the activated platelet surface
promotes prothrombin activation, and therefore,
thrombin generation by providing a catalytic
surface for the assembling of plasma factors of
the  xxxg741xxx  complex [26]. in the environment of a platelet aggregate, small amounts of
thrombin might initiate the catalytic process of
platelet-dependent thrombin generation that in
turn amplifies thrombin production in areas of
enhanced platelet activation.  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists have been shown to reduce platelet-dependent thrombin generation and microvesicle
formation [27±30]. we found that some but not
all antagonists decrease platelet-mediated thrombin generation depending on the stimulus to
induce thrombin generation (thrombin, tissue
factor) and the concentration of the  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia
inhibitor. although we do not provide conclusive data at present, the differential effects of

62

t. dickfeld et al./thrombosis research 101 (2001) 53±64

various  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists on plateletdependent thrombin generation might be associated with differences in intrinsic  xxxg1202xxx ± iiia
activating properties.
3.4. therapeutic implications
from a therapeutic viewpoint, the expression of
libs neo-epitopes may facilitate the production
of antibodies against libs as a neo-epitope and
may cause subsequent immune thrombocytopenia, a rare but potential serious side effect of
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia blockers [31]. recently, we showed
that administration of  xxxd53xxx  induces libs-1
expression that correlates with peripheral platelet count [17]. however, at present, there are
no conclusive clinical data to support this
hypothesis. moreover, it has been shown that
libs-inducing  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists enhance
txa2 production after activation of platelets
with thrombin [23]. as the vasoconstrictor
txa2 compromises coronary microcirculation
in acute coronary syndromes [32], combined
administration of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors
and  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists might be mandatory in these patients. this might also be
important when  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists are
administered chronically. although several
 xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists have been evaluated in
large clinical studies, the efficacy of  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia
inhibitors varies depending on the clinical
situation and the chemical type of antagonist
[5,6,13,14]. the described herein differential
antiplatelet effects of distinct  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia blockers might help to explain the varying clinical
efficacy in reducing thrombo-ischemic events in
patients with acute coronary syndromes or
undergoing coronary interventions.
3.5. limitations of the studies
at present, we provide no definitive data
whether the described differential antiplatelet
effects of the tested  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists have
consequences for the treatment of patients with
coronary heart disease [33]. specifically, it is of
interest whether  xxxg1202xxx ±iiia antagonists that can
induce conformational changes in the receptor
(libs induction) might lead to a thrombotic
episode various disease states. although antago-

nist-induced libs induction on  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia is
reversible, one might speculate that dissociation
of low molecular weight inhibitors in situations
when plasma concentrations decrease rapid
binding of soluble fibrinogen to its still activated
(libs positive) receptor might induce aggregate
formation (rebound phenomenon), thus, prothrombotic activities. comparative evaluation of
antagonists in vivo should be performed before
making final decisions on these issues. in the
present study, we did not address the issue of
synergistic effects of other antiplatelet drugs
(aspirin, clopidogrel) with  xxxg1202xxx  ± iiia antagonists on platelet function. the effect of  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia antagonists on platelet function such as
release reaction, adhesion, or procoagulant activity might be different in the presence of other
antiplatelet compounds that are administered
adjuvantively especially in coronary stent
patients. a systematic evaluation of synergistic
effects of antiplatelet drugs will help to clarify
this issue.
in conclusion, preclinical evaluation of  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia antagonists might disclose substantial differences in regard to intrinsic activity of various
inhibitors. it is tempting to speculate that  xxxg1202xxx ±
iiia blockers with low or no intrinsic activity
might be advantageous, however, conclusive
data has to be evaluated in clinical studies.
