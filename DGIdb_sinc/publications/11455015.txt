g protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels are targets for volatile anesthetics.  g protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (girks) are a family of homo- and hetero-oligomeric k(+) channels composed of different subunits ( xxxg1252xxx  to 4 in mammals).  xxxg1253xxx  and  xxxg1252xxx  are found mainly in the atrium, whereas neuronal cells predominantly express the  xxxg1252xxx ,  xxxg1254xxx , and girk3 isoforms. when activated, girk channels slow the firing rate of atrial myocytes and neuronal cells. because of their key role in controlling excitability, we investigated the influence of a prototypic anesthetic, halothane, on girk channels of different subunit composition expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes. halothane enhanced background currents through hetero-oligomeric  xxxg1252xxx / xxxg1253xxx  and homo-oligomeric  xxxg1252xxx (f137s) channels but not through homo-oligomeric  xxxg1254xxx  channels. this activation of basal current did not depend on the presence of coexpressed g protein-coupled receptors but instead required the presence of g(beta/gamma). in contrast to basal girk currents, the agonist-induced girk current (via coexpressed m2 muscarinic receptors) was inhibited by halothane. for  xxxg1252xxx / xxxg1253xxx  and  xxxg1252xxx (f137s) channels this inhibition was most pronounced at low concentrations of the anesthetic (0.1-0.3 mm) and occurred also when channels had been activated by guanosine-5'-o-(3-thio)triphosphate. this inhibition, however, was overridden by high concentrations of halothane (0.9 mm) and augmentation of the agonist-induced current was observed. this increase in agonist-induced current was never seen with  xxxg1254xxx  homo-oligomeric channels. agonist-induced currents mediated by  xxxg1254xxx  channels were always inhibited by halothane with an ic(50) value of approximately 60 microm. these data suggest a direct interaction of halothane with girk channels.
