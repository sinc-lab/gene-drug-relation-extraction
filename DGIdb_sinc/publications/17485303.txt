2. introduction

although  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) is essential for
mouse ovulation, fertilization, implantation and
decidualization, the regulation and function of cox-2 in
rat reproduction are still unknown. this study was designed
to examine the action of cox-2 in rat ovulation,
implantation and decidualization by using two specific
inhibitors of cox-2 ( xxxd2727xxx  and  xxxd2723xxx ).
compared to control, either  xxxd2727xxx  or  xxxd2723xxx 
significantly inhibited the ovulation in the superovulated
rats. although  xxxd2727xxx  had no obvious effects on the
number of implantation sites and the vascular permeability,
the expression of  xxxg1806xxx , hb-egf and vimentin
proteins was down-regulated in the  xxxd2727xxx -treated
groups. cox-1 protein was upregulated by  xxxd2727xxx 
treatment.  xxxd2727xxx  also had an inhibitory effect on
decidualization during early pregnancy and under artificial
decidualization. moreover,  xxxd2727xxx  caused the increase
of the gestation period and the reduction of litter size and
birth weight compared to controls. based on our data, rat
implantation and decidualization were delayed by
 xxxd2727xxx  treatment, resulting in the reduction of litter size
and birth weight and the prolongation of gestational length,
suggesting that cox-2 plays an important role in
implantation and decidualization.

prostaglandins (pgs) are considered to be
proinflammatory and play important roles during female
reproduction (1,2). cyclooxygenase (cox) is a ratelimiting enzyme that produces pgs from  xxxd208xxx 
and includes two isoforms, cox-1 and cox-2. cox
function in mice has been demonstrated with gene
knockout experiments. cox-1-deficient females are fertile
with specific parturition defects, whereas cox-2-deficient
females are infertile with abnormalities in ovulation,
fertilization, implantation and decidualization (2-4). in
another study, cox-2-deficient mice did not show any
abnormality in embryo implantation except for the
reduction in the number of ovulated and fertilized eggs, and
a delay in decidual growth (5). recently, wang et al (6)
reported that the reproductive defects of cox-2-mutant
mice mainly depend upon genetic background.
cox-2 immunostaining was also strongly
detected in the subluminal stroma when the attachment
reaction began in rat uterus. at the implantation site on day
6, cox-2 immunostaining was detected in the stromal
cells, but not in the primary decidual zone at the antimesometrial side (7). to date, cox-2-deficient rats are still
not available for this kind of study. although cox-2(-/-)

0.85% (w/v) nacl. pseudopregnancy was induced by cocaging female rats with vasectomized males and confirmed
by checking vaginal plug (either in the vagina or on the
cage floor) next morning.

mouse is very powerful in understanding the physiological
functions, the early lethality often caused a large problem for
further study on late development. thus, the use of a cox-2
inhibitor at specific times during pregnancy should have less
severe effects than the total absence of activity throughout the
life span as occurs in cox-2 null mice (8).

3.4. artificial decidualization
artificial decidualization was induced by
intraluminally infusing 100 µl of sesame oil into one
uterine horn on day 5 of pseudopregnancy, whereas the
contralateral, uninjected horn served as a control. the uteri
were collected 96 h after the injection of sesame oil (i.e., on
day 9 of pseudopregnancy).

although there are several reports on the effects of
cox inhibitors in rats, the results remain controversial. in
wistar rats, indomethacin,  xxxd2727xxx  or celecoxib caused the
increase of preimplantation and postimplantation loss, and
gestation length (9). sookvanichsilp and pulbutr (10) reported
that indomethacin at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day as well as
celecoxib at doses of 80 and 160 mg/kg/day significantly
reduced the proportion of pregnant rats. however, kennedy
(11) showed that indomethacin had no significant effect on the
mean number of implantation sites when indomethacin was
given s.c. at a dose of 1 mg/rat twice on day 5 of pregnancy.
poyser (12) reported that ns-398 (a cox-2 inhibitor) at a s.c.
dose of 12 mg/kg/day on days 3-4 of pregnancy failed to
inhibit implantation in rats. it is possible that the dose of ns398 in that study was still too low to inhibit cox-2 activity
adequately in the rat uterus.

3.5. measurement of vascular permeability of rat
implantation sites
vascular permeability was assayed as described
by satchi-fainaro et al. (16). briefly, the implantation sites
on day 6 were identified by intravenous injection of 1 ml of
1% (w/v) chicago blue solution in 0.85% (w/v) nacl. the
same weight of implantation sites were collected in 500 µl
formamide. the optical density at 620 nm was measured
after 120 h extraction.
3.6. treatments with cox-2 inhibitors
cox-2 inhibitor, either  xxxd2727xxx  or niflumic
acid (cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi, usa) was
dissolved in dmso and diluted to proper concentrations in
0.2 ml of dmso for each injection/rat. the same amount
of dmso was injected i.p. for controls. the dosages of
 xxxd2727xxx  and  xxxd2723xxx  used in this study were based
on previously described (9,17,18).

both  xxxd2727xxx  and  xxxd2723xxx  are selective
inhibitors for cox-2 (13,14). the aim of this study was to
examine whether cox-2 is important for ovulation,
implantation and decidualization in the rat. specific inhibitors
of cox-2 ( xxxd2727xxx  and  xxxd2723xxx ) were used in this
study to inhibit cox-2 action.
3. materials and methods

3.7. immunohistochemistry
rat uteri were immediately fixed in bouin’s solution
for 24 h, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin wax.
immunostaining was performed as described (19). briefly,
nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% (v/v) normal horse
serum in pbs at 37 °c for 1 h. the sections were incubated
with rabbit anti-human vimentin, goat anti-human  xxxg1806xxx ,
goat anti-human hb-egf or goat anti-human cox-1 (santa
cruz biotechnology, inc., ca) in horse serum at 4 °c for 16 h.
the sections were then incubated with biotinylated goat antirabbit igg or rabbit anti-goat igg followed by a streptavidinalkaline phosphatase complex and vector red according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (vectastain abc-ap kit, vector
laboratories, burlingame, ca). vector red was visualized as
a red color. endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity was
inhibited by supplementing 1 mm levamisole (sigma) into
vector red substrate solution.

3.1 animals
mature rats (sprague-dawley strain) were caged
in a controlled environment (14 hr light: 10 hr dark). all
animal procedures were approved by the institutional
animal care and use committee of northeast agricultural
university.
3.2 superovulation
because of irregularities in rat estrous cycles, a
standard protocol of superovulation was used to compare
ovulation potential of the drug-treated rats with that of the
vehicle treated controls as described in the mouse (8).
female rats at 24-26-days old were superovulated with 40
iu ecg, followed by 40 iu hcg 48 h later. these rats were
injected i.p. with different dosages of  xxxd2727xxx  or
 xxxd2723xxx  (cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi, usa) in
a volume of 0.2 ml 30 min before hcg injection. the
oocytes were collected from the oviducts 24 h after hcg
injection and counted. because immature rats show
ovulatory defects (15), sexual mature rats were also used
for superovulation.

3.8. statistical analysis
at least 3 rats were used in each stage or
treatment in this study. quantitative data were expressed as
mean ± sem and analyzed by spss software. statistical
significance was calculated using student’s two-tailed,
unpaired t-test.

3.3. early pregnancy and pseudopregnancy
female rats were mated with fertile males of the
same strain to induce pregnancy. pregnancy was confirmed
by examining the spermatozoa in vaginal smear (day 1 =
day of vaginal sperm positive). the implantation sites on
days 6-7 of pregnancy were identified by intravenous
injection of 1 ml of 1% (w/v) chicago blue solution in

in order to examine the effects of cox-2
inhibitors on rat ovulation, superovulated rats at 24-26-days

figure 1. female rats were superovulated with 40 iu ecg, followed by 40 iu hcg 48 h later. these rats were injected i.p. with
 xxxd2727xxx  or  xxxd2723xxx  30 min before hcg injection. the oocytes were collected from the oviducts 24 h after hcg injection
and counted. sexual mature rats (designated as mature rats) and 24-26 days old rats (designated as young rats) were used in this
study, respectively. ovulation was significantly inhibited by either  xxxd2727xxx  or  xxxd2723xxx  compared to controls. the number
of rats used in each treatment was shown in each bar. values are presented as the mean ± sem.
old were treated i.p. with different doses of  xxxd2727xxx  or
 xxxd2723xxx  30 min before hcg injection. the oocytes
were collected from the oviducts 24 h after hcg injection,
counted and shown in figure 1.

compared to control groups, there were no significant
differences for implantation sites in the nimesulidetreated groups on days 6, 7 and 9, respectively.
nevertheless, the number of implantation sites in the
 xxxd2727xxx -treated group was 11.40±0.68 on day 8 of
pregnancy, which was significantly less than control
group (13.14±0.67).

in control group, the number of ovulated oocytes
was 34.25±4.01 per rat. when the superovulated rats were
treated with three doses of  xxxd2727xxx , there were
3.07±1.13 (10 mg/kg), 1.71±0.87 (40 mg/kg), and 0 (80
mg/kg) ovulated oocytes, respectively. in order to further
verify the specificity of  xxxd2727xxx  on ovulation, the
superovulated rats were treated with  xxxd2723xxx  (10
mg/kg), another cox-2 specific inhibitor, in which the
number of ovulated oocytes was 6.25±3.02.

4.3. effects of  xxxd2727xxx  on vascular permeability
endometrial vascular permeability has been
considered as a marker for embryo implantation (20).
because prostaglandins play a key role in endometrial
vascular permeability (21-23), vascular permeability was
measured as described by satchi-fainaro et al (16).
compared to the vascular permeability of the implantation
sites on day 6 of normal pregnancy or dmso treatment,
there were no significant changes in vascular permeability
after pregnant rats were treated with twice on day 4 (20:00)
and day 5 (08:00), or once on day 5 (08:00) (figure 3).

because immature rats were showed to have
ovulatory detects (15), sexual mature rats were also used
for superovulation. similarly, the ovulation in sexual
mature rats were also significantly inhibited by treating
with  xxxd2727xxx  or  xxxd2723xxx  (figure 1). we found that
ovulation was significantly inhibited by either  xxxd2727xxx 
or  xxxd2723xxx  compared to controls.

4.4. effects of  xxxd2727xxx  on the expression of
implantation-related proteins
vimentin is a molecular marker for stromal cells
and decidualization (24). on day 6 of pregnancy, vimentin
immunostaining was strongly seen in the subluminal
stroma at implantation site in the control (figure 4a), but
not detected in the uterus of the  xxxd2727xxx -treated group
(figure 4b).

4.2. effects of  xxxd2727xxx  on rat embryo implantation
since attachment reaction already occurred in the
morning on day 5 of pregnancy in the rat, the pregnant rats
in the day 4 evening (20:00) were used to examine whether
cox-2 inhibitors have any effects on attachment reaction.
compared to controls,  xxxd2727xxx  had no obvious effects
on the number of implantation sites (figure 2a).

 xxxg1806xxx  has been shown to play a key role in
mouse implantation (25). after pregnant rats were treated
with  xxxd2727xxx  once on day 5, uterine expression of
 xxxg1806xxx  protein was examined on day 6. on day 6 of
pregnancy,  xxxg1806xxx  immunostaining was strongly seen
in a larger area of subluminal stroma surrounding the
implanting blastocyst in the control (figure 4c), but was
only seen in a smaller area of subluminal stroma

in order to check the effects of  xxxd2727xxx  on
implantation, pregnant rats were treated with  xxxd2727xxx 
(40 mg/kg, i.p.) daily from day 5 of pregnancy. after
these treated rats were sacrificed 24 h after last injection
on days 6, 7, 8, and 9 of pregnancy, respectively, the
number of implantation sites was evaluated (figure 2b).

evening (20:00) of day 4 and once daily (08:00) from day 5 of pregnancy. (b) pregnant rats were first treated with  xxxd2727xxx  (40
mg/kg, i.p.) once daily (08:00) from day 5 of pregnancy. after these treated rats were sacrificed 24 h after last injection on days
6, 7, 8, and 9 of pregnancy, respectively, the number of implantation sites was evaluated. compared to control groups, there were
no significant differences for implantation sites in the  xxxd2727xxx -treated groups on days 6, 7 and 9, respectively. nevertheless,
the number of implantation sites in the  xxxd2727xxx -treated group on day 8 of pregnancy was significantly less than control group.
the number of rats used in each treatment was shown in each bar. values are presented as the mean ± sem.
surrounding the implanting blastocyst in the nimesulidetreated group (figure 4d).

pregnant rats on day 5 were treated with  xxxd2727xxx , cox1 immunostaining was detected in both luminal epithelium
and the subluminal stroma surrounding the implanting
blastocyst (figure 5).

because hb-egf is specifically expressed in the
luminal epithelium during the apposition phase in mouse
uterus (26), uterine expression of hb-egf protein was
examined following  xxxd2727xxx  treatment. on day 6 of
pregnancy, hb-egf immunostaining was strongly detected
in the luminal epithelium of implantation site in the control
(figure 4e), but weakly seen in the  xxxd2727xxx -treated
group (figure 4f).

4.5. effects of  xxxd2727xxx  on rat decidualization
in order to examine whether  xxxd2727xxx  treatment
before attachment reaction has any effects on following
decidualization, pregnant rats were first injected i.p. with
 xxxd2727xxx  (40 mg/kg) in the evening (20:00) of day 4 and
then injectd daily from day 5 of pregnancy. compared to
controls, the weights of implantation sites on days 7, 8 and
9 of pregnancy were also significantly reduced by
 xxxd2727xxx  treatments (figure 6a).

because there was an up-regulation of cox-1
expression in cox-2 deficient mice of cd-1 background
(6), cox-1 immunostaining was examined to see whether
cox-1 is up-regulated following  xxxd2727xxx  treatment.
indeed, cox-1 immunostaining was only seen in the
luminal epithelium of implantation site in the control. after

in order to see the effects of  xxxd2727xxx  on
decidualization, pregnant rats were injected i.p. with
 xxxd2727xxx  (40 mg/kg) daily from day 5 of pregnancy. the

day 6 of normal pregnancy was measured as a reference. the vascular mermeability was measured on day 6 of pregnancy after
pregnant rats were treated with dmso for control,  xxxd2727xxx  on days 4 and 5, and  xxxd2727xxx  on day 5, respectively. the
number of rats used in each treatment was shown in each bar. values are presented as the mean ± sem.

weight of implantation sites was examined on days 7, 8 and
9 of pregnancy, respectively (figure 6b). after pregnant
rats were treated with  xxxd2727xxx , the weights of
implantation sites were significantly reduced on days 7, 8
and 9 of pregnancy compared to control groups. on day 9
of pregnancy, the weight of implantation site in
thenimesulide-treated group (21.74±0.57) was only similar
to that on day 7 of pregnancy in the control (19.14±0.26).
the sizes of the implantation site on days 8 and 9 of
pregnancy were much smaller than that in the controls,
respectively (figure 6c).

4.6. effects of cox-2 inhibitors on artificial
decidualization
in order to check the effects of  xxxd2727xxx  or
 xxxd2723xxx  on artificial decidualization, pseudopregnant
rats were treated with  xxxd2727xxx  or  xxxd2723xxx  (40
mg/kg) daily for 4 days, beginning from day 5 of
pseudopregnancy 30 min before the intrauterine injection
of oil. the weights of the uterine horns with oil injection
were examined on day 9 of pseudopregnancy. we found
that either  xxxd2727xxx  or  xxxd2723xxx  could significantly
reduce the weights of each uterine horn compared to

3337

cox-2 in rat female reproduction

 xxxd2723xxx  compared to control. the role of prostaglandins
in ovulation was first suggested by orczyk and behrman (27).
ns-398, another cox-2 inhibitor, also caused a reduction of
ovulation and prostaglandin production (28). when mice were
treated with celecoxib (600 mg/kg/dose) for 4 days before the
induction of superovulation, a smaller number of recovered
eggs and fewer fertilized eggs were obtained compared to the
vehicle-treated females (8). the action of cox-2 in ovulation
was also confirmed in cox-2-deficient mice, in which
ovulation and fertilization were severely compromised (2-4).
gonadotropin stimulation and simultaneous treatment with
pge2 or interleukin-1beta resulted in ovulation of cox-2(-/-)
mice comparable to that in cox-2(+/+) (29).  xxxg1876xxx , the
key enzyme for pge2 synthesis, was highly expressed in
granulose cells of mouse ovary and induced by hcg treatment
(30). the induction of cox-2 in rats was very rapid, 2–4 h
after hcg treatment, and preceded ovulation by 10 h (31).
cox-2 was considered as a potential regulator of the
mammalian ovulatory clock (32,33). our data showed that
cox-2 is essential for rat ovulation as in the mouse. recently,
it was suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(nsaids) and selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitors may
interfere with ovulation and the rupture of the follicle, causing
reversible infertility (34,35).  xxxd2561xxx , a cox-2 inhibitor,
resulted in a reversible delay of ovulation, an increase in
follicular diameter, and a decrease in plasma progesterone
level (36). these data suggest that cox-2 inhibition may have
a potential for contraceptive use.

or  xxxd2727xxx  (40 mg/kg, i.p.) on day 5 for 24 h. arrow:

controls. in the control group, the weight of each uterine
horn was 1216.6±71.1 mg. when these rats were treated
with  xxxd2727xxx  and  xxxd2723xxx , the weights of the
uterine horn with oil injection significantly decreased to
296.66±35.5 and 466.9±64.4 mg, respectively (figure 7a).
from uterine morphology, the size of uterine horn under
artificial decidualization was much bigger than that in the
control (figure 7b).

5.2. cox-2 action on rat implantation
in this study,  xxxd2727xxx  had no significant
effects on the number of implanted embryos and vascular
permeability when  xxxd2727xxx  was initially treated in the
evening (20:00) of day 4 (before attachment reaction) or in
the morning (08:00) of day 5 (after attachment reaction). in
the mouse uterus on day 5 of pregnancy,  xxxg1806xxx  and
hb-egf are specifically expressed at implantation sites
and essential for implantation (25,26,37).  xxxg1806xxx  was
also highly expressed at implantation sites in rat uterus
(38). in our study, the intensities of  xxxg1806xxx  and hbegf immunostaining were severely declined on day 6 of
pregnancy following  xxxd2727xxx  treatment.  xxxg1876xxx  is
also highly expressed at implantation site in the mouse and
rat (7,19). in our previous study,  xxxg1876xxx  protein
expression was completely inhibited when pregnant rats on
day 5 were treated with  xxxd2727xxx  for 24 h (7). this
suggests that molecular changes already happened before
the effects on the number of implantation sites and vascular
permeability became noticeable. in cox-2(-/-) female
mice, there are severe deficiencies in mouse implantation
and decidualization at a c57bl/6j/129 genetic background
(2). however, cox-2-knockouted mice in another genetic
background only show an approximately 24 h delay in the
initial rate of decidual growth after implantation compared
to that in heterozygous or wild-type recipients (5).
recently, wang et al (6) indicated that the deficiency in
cox-2 null mice at cd-1 background could be rescued by
cox-1 overexpression, but not at c57bl/6j/129
background. in this study, cox-1 expression was indeed
up-regulated after  xxxd2727xxx  treatment at a background of
sprague-dawley strain. it has been shown that cox-2
inhibition in cox-1-deficient mice will lead to complete

4.7. effects of cox-2 inhibitors on rat gestational
length and birth weight
since  xxxd2727xxx  was shown to have significantly
inhibitory effects on rat decidualization in this study, the
effects of  xxxd2727xxx  on litter size, birth weight and
gestational length were further examined after pregnant rats
were treated once with  xxxd2727xxx  (40 mg/kg, i.p.) on day 5
or twice on both days 5 and 6 of pregnancy. compared to
control, the litter size was not significantly different in the
 xxxd2727xxx -treated group on day 5, but was significantly
less in the  xxxd2727xxx -treated group on both days 5 and 6
(figure 8a). the birth weight was significantly less in both
 xxxd2727xxx -treated groups compared to control (figure 8b).
the gestational length was 22.44±0.18 days in the control.
after pregnant rats were treated with  xxxd2727xxx  once or
twice, the gestational lengths were 23.11±0.11 and
23.71±0.29 days, respectively, which were significantly
longer than control (figure 8c).

5.1. cox-2 action in rat ovulation
because of irregularity in rat estrous cycles,
superovulation was used to examine the effects of
 xxxd2727xxx  on rat ovulation in our study. in both 24-26
days old and sexual mature rats, the number of ovulated
oocytes was significantly reduced by either  xxxd2727xxx  or

mg/kg/day could significantly reduce the proportion of
pregnant rats. at the anti-implantation dosages, they
exhibited no significant effect on proportion of rats with
blue dye sites in the endometrial vascular permeability
study, but they could significantly reduce the uterine
decidualization.
5.4. the secondary effects of  xxxd2727xxx  treatment on
rat reproduction
although the number of implantation sites and
vascular permeability were not affected by  xxxd2727xxx 
treatment, the expression of implantation-related genes, the
weight of decidual tissues, litter size, birth weight and
gestational length were all severely affected by  xxxd2727xxx 
treatment. interestingly, cox-2-derived pgs contribute to
the onset of parturition after the decrease in serum
progesterone level (39). cox-2 inhibitor has been reported
to possibly prevent human preterm delivery (40). however,
it is impossible for cox-2 to act on late pregnancy directly
since the estimated mean terminal half-life for  xxxd2727xxx 
varied from 1.96 to 4.73 hours (41). in this study, the last
injection of  xxxd2727xxx  was done on day 8 of pregnancy.
all of the abnormalities in litter size, birth weight and
gestational length should result from the effects of
 xxxd2727xxx  on implantation and decidualization during
early pregnancy. in our study, except for the expression
implantation-related genes, the size and weight of
implantation sites were severely compromised by
 xxxd2727xxx  treatment. however, implantation and
decidualization were not completely blocked by  xxxd2727xxx 
treatment, and gestational length was only prolonged,
suggesting a delay in implantation and decidualization
following  xxxd2727xxx  treatment. our data on
immunostaining and decidualization also suggest a delay in
implantation and decidualization. similar results have been
observed with cpla2a-, cox-2- and lpa3-deficient mice
(2,42,43). deferred implantation in these mice leads to
defective postimplantation development, including retarded
fetal development, embryo crowding, sharing of placentas
by multiple embryos and reduced litter size. in most
successful human pregnancies, the conceptus implants 8 to
10 days after ovulation. the risk of early pregnancy loss
increases with later implantation (44).

figure 8. effects of cox-2 inhibitors on litter size, birth
weight and gestational length. after pregnant rats were
treated once with  xxxd2727xxx  (40 mg/kg, i.p.) on day 5 or
twice on both days 5 and 6 of pregnancy, the litter size,
birth weight and gestational length were recorded at birth.
the number of rats used in each treatment was shown in
each bar. values are presented as the mean ± sem.
reproductive failure, suggesting a lack of alternative
sources of prostaglandin synthesis (8). it should be checked
whether rat implantation is blocked after both cox-1 and
cox-2 are inhibited.
5.3. cox-2 action on rat decidualization
in our study, the size and weight of implantation
sites were not only reduced by  xxxd2727xxx  treatment, but
artificial decidualization was also severely inhibited by
 xxxd2727xxx  treatment. vimentin is a marker for stromal cell
decidualization (24). on day 6 of pregnancy, vimentin was
highly expressed in the subluminal stroma surrounding the
implanting blastocyst in the control, but not detected in the
 xxxd2727xxx -treated rat uterus. cox-2-knockouted mice
show a delay in the initial rate of decidual growth after
implantation compared to that in heterozygous or wild-type
recipients (5,6). in the mouse, lower doses of celecoxib
showed little effects on the number of implantation sites,
and there was a reduction only in the weight of
implantation sites by day 6 (8). celecoxib, a specific cox2 inhibitor, could cause the failure of decidual reaction in
the mouse (8). in wistar rats, preimplantation,
postimplantation loss and gestation length were all
increased by the gavage administration of indomethacin,
 xxxd2727xxx  or celecoxib (9). sookvanichsilp and pulbutr
(10) demonstrated that indomethacin at a dose of 5
mg/kg/day as well as celecoxib at doses of 80 and 160

in conclusion, ovulation was significantly
inhibited by  xxxd2727xxx  treatment. the expression of
 xxxg1806xxx , hb-egf and vimentin proteins was downregulated in the  xxxd2727xxx -treated groups. our data
suggested that rat implantation and decidualization were
delayed by  xxxd2727xxx  treatment, resulting in the reduction
of litter size and birth weight and the prolongation of
gestational length. our data also indicated that proper
implantation and decidualization are very important for
following embryonic development.
