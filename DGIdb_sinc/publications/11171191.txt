cloning and characterization of a cdna encoding serine palmitoyltransferase in arabidopsis thaliana.  the first and committed step in de novo sphingolipid synthesis is catalysed by serine palmitoyltransferase (ec 2.3.1.50), which condenses serine and  xxxd2832xxx -coa to form 3-ketosphinganine in a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent reaction. we have isolated and characterized a cdna clone from arabidopsis thaliana that is homologous to yeast and mammalian  xxxg2195xxx . for a functional identification, the a. thaliana homologous cdna was expressed in escherichia coli, which resulted in significant production of new  xxxd1890xxx  in e. coli cells.
