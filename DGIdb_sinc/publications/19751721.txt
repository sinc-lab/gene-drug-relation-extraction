cardiac glycosides inhibit the na+,k+-atpase and are used for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure
and atrial ﬁbrillation. in human heart three isoforms of na+,k+-atpase are expressed: alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1.
it is unknown, if clinically used cardiac glycosides differ in isoform speciﬁc afﬁnities, and if the isoforms have
speciﬁc subcellular localization in human cardiac myocytes. human na+,k+-atpase isoforms alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1 and
alpha3beta1 were expressed in yeast which has no endogenous na+,k+-atpase. isoform speciﬁc afﬁnities of
digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , beta-acetyldigoxin, methyldigoxin and ouabain were assessed in [³h]-ouabain binding assays
in the absence or presence of k+ (each n = 5). the subcellular localizations of the na+,k+-atpase isoforms
were investigated in isolated human atrial cardiomyocytes by immunohistochemistry. in the absence of k+,
methyldigoxin ( xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  >  xxxg832xxx  >  xxxg831xxx ) and ouabain ( xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  =  xxxg832xxx  >  xxxg831xxx ) showed distinct isoform speciﬁc afﬁnities, while
for digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx  and beta-acetyldigoxin no differences were found. in the presence of k+, also digoxin
( xxxg831xxx  =  xxxg832xxx  >  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx ) and beta-acetyldigoxin ( xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  >  xxxg832xxx ) had isoform speciﬁcities. a comparison between the cardiac
glycosides demonstrated highly different afﬁnity proﬁles for the isoforms. immunohistochemistry showed
that all three isoforms are located in the plasma membrane and in intracellular membranes, but only alpha1beta1
and alpha2beta1 are located in the t-tubuli. cardiac glycosides show distinct isoform speciﬁc afﬁnities and different
afﬁnity proﬁles to na+,k+-atpase isoforms which have different subcellular localizations in human
cardiomyocytes. thus, in contrast to current notion, different  xxxd2799xxx  agents may signiﬁcantly differ
in their pharmacological proﬁle which could be of hitherto unknown clinical relevance.

1. introduction
cardiac glycosides have been used for pharmacological treatment
of heart failure for more than 200 years (sterkowicz, 1985). today
they are still indicated for heart rate control in atrial ﬁbrillation
especially when concomitant heart failure is present. the current
guidelines for the treatment of heart failure recommend the use of
cardiac glycosides (at low concentrations) if serious heart failure

symptoms remain even after optimal adjustment of all other
therapeutic options (hunt et al., 2005; swedberg et al., 2005). there
was only one large randomized clinical trial, the dig-trial, in which
treatment with cardiac glycosides (digoxin) was compared to placebo
(digitalis investigation group, 1997). the results showed overall an
unaltered mortality of patients treated with digoxin, but signiﬁcantly
reduced hospitalizations.
thus, digitalis is a class i or iia recommendation for the treatment
of symptoms of heart failure in patients with sinus rhythm according
to the american heart association (aha) and european society of
cardiology (esc) guidelines, respectively (hunt et al., 2005; swedberg
et al., 2005), and it is considered class i for the treatment of heart
failure in the presence of atrial ﬁbrillation. however, no distinction
between different types of cardiac glycosides is made. in the
treatment of atrial ﬁbrillation digoxin is recommended for heart
rate control (fuster et al., 2006), but in clinical practice all cardiac

glycosides are used alike. this is based on pure assumption, since so
far no comparative studies on different glycoside agents were
performed. for the molecular structure of the  xxxd2799xxx  see
fig. 1.
one putative difference of the agents may be a different preference
for the isoforms of the na+,k+-atpase. in human heart, mainly three
different alpha-isoforms ( xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx ,  xxxg831xxx  and  xxxg832xxx ) are expressed as a heteromer
together with the  xxxg836xxx -isoform (wang et al., 1996).
it is not clear if only one isoform mediates the positive inotropic
action of the cardiac glycosides or if it is an effect of several isoforms. it
seems that in mice both,  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and  xxxg831xxx , are involved in the regulation of
the cardiac contractility (james et al., 1999; dostanic et al., 2004).
in the present study, the binding afﬁnities of different, clinically
used cardiac glycosides (i.e. digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , methyldigoxin and
beta-acetyldigoxin) to each individual human cardiac na+,k+-atpase
isoform were assessed for the ﬁrst time. this was done by using a
yeast expression system of the isoforms. due to the fact that yeast
has no endogenous na+,k+-atpase, the experiments were speciﬁc
for the tested human isoform. furthermore, the speciﬁc subcellular
distribution of na+,k+-atpase isoforms  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx ,  xxxg831xxx  and  xxxg832xxx  were investigated in human cardiac myocytes as a putative underlying
cause for speciﬁc function in humans. the results contribute to a

better understanding of the underlying mechanism of cardiac
glycosides action in heart failure and might lead to more differentiated therapeutical strategies in the use of these agents.

was purchased from köhler chemie, alsbach-haehnlein, germany.
the monoclonal igg1  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -antibody (mck1) and the monoclonal igg1
 xxxg831xxx -antibody (mcb2) were kindly provided by kathleen sweadner,
boston, usa. the polyclonal  xxxg832xxx -antibody (anti-ted) was kindly
provided by thomas pressley, lubbock, usa. all other materials
were either purchased from sigma (taufkirchen, germany), merckeurolab (munich, germany) or roth (karlsruhe, germany).

control western blots were performed in order to verify speciﬁc
expression of isoforms of na+,k+-atpase (fig. 2). for further
experiments, the 4 clones with the highest expression level were
pooled in order to get sufﬁcient amounts of protein.

2.2. human myocardium and kidney tissue

ouabain binding experiments were performed as previously
described (erdmann and schoner, 1973) (schwinger et al., 1991;
müller-ehmsen et al., 2001a,b). for each binding reaction 200 mug of
membrane protein was incubated with 20 nm [³h]-ouabain (speciﬁc
activity 17 ci/mmol, concentration 1 mci/ml). the incubation buffer
consisted of 4 mm h3po4, 4 mm mgcl2, and 50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.4,
ﬁnal concentrations, total volume 1 ml). digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , methyldigoxin and beta-acetyldigoxin were added at increasing concentrations
(10 different concentrations, 0–10 mum) to inhibit ouabain binding.
unspeciﬁc binding was assessed in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled
ouabain.
the afﬁnities of the ligands for the speciﬁc na+,k+-atpase
heteromers were assessed with the computerized assistance of
graph pad prism® (one-site competition) using the previously
established kd for ouabain to the individual heteromers (13 nm for
alpha1beta1, 33 nm for alpha2beta1 and 17 nm for alpha3beta1) (müller-ehmsen et al.,
2001a). in addition, the binding afﬁnities were assessed in the
presence of k+ in order to obtain results under more physiological
conditions. however, a concentration of 4 mm k+ suppressed the
[³h]-ouabain binding in a way that made a proper statistical analysis
impossible. due to these experimental setup problems 1 mm k+ were
chosen for further experiments.

human right myocardial tissue was obtained from the right
auricles of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
the patients gave a written informed consent prior to surgery. the
patients received beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitors (ace-inibitors), aldosterone-antagonists, statins and diuretics. none of the patients was treated with cardiac glycosides.
anaesthesia was achieved by injection of ﬂunitrazepam, fentanyl
and pancuronium bromide with enﬂurane or isoﬂurane. cardiac arrest
was achieved by performing intraoperative perfusion of the heart of
 xxxd2988xxx  solution (custodiol®) while patients were connected to a
cardiopulmonary bypass.
2.3. expression of human na+,k+-atpase in yeast and
membrane preparation
alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 heteromers of the human na+,k+-atpase
were expressed in yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae 30-4) as previously
described (müller-ehmsen et al., 2001a). a microsomal membrane
fraction of yeast cells was prepared (eakle et al., 1992) and expression
of na+,k+-atpase was conﬁrmed by ouabain binding experiments.

2.4. ouabain binding experiments in yeast membranes

brain expressing  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx ,  xxxg831xxx  and  xxxg832xxx  was used as a positive control for all isoforms. human kidney expressing  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  only was used as a positive control for that isoform. non-transfected yeast
was used as negative control.

2.5. western blot
after protein determination by the lowry method (lowry et al.,
1951) equal amounts of protein (75 mug) were mixed with loading
buffer containing tris–hcl, glycerol,  xxxd26xxx  and bromophenol blue. samples were vortexed and boiled at 95 °c before being
subjected to sds-page. samples were loaded on a 4% sds stacking
electrophoresis gel (1 h at 80 ma) and subsequently separated on a
12% sds gel for 3–5 h at 110–130 ma (electrophoresis chamber
hoefer, munich, germany). the proteins were then transferred to a
pvdf (polyvinyldienﬂuoride) membrane by tank blotting (16 h at
65 ma). efﬁciency of the blotting was conﬁrmed by coomassie blue
staining of the gel and ponceau® staining of the membrane. unspeciﬁc
binding of the antibody was blocked by incubation with 5% fat dry milk
powder solution in tris buffered saline containing tween® (tbs-t) for
15–24 h at 4 °c. subsequently, the membrane was incubated for 12–
18 h at 4 °c with the respective ﬁrst antibody at indicated concentrations. after washing in fresh, cold tbs-t the blots were blocked again
with 5% fat dry milk powder solution in tbs-t for 20 min at room
temperature. following a second washing step, the membranes were
subjected to the appropriate horseradish peroxidase conjugated
secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. immunoreactive
bands were visualized by chemiluminescence detected on x-ray ﬁlm
(hyperﬁlm ecl) using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (both,
amersham life science, buckinghamshire, united kingdom).
2.6. single cell preparation of cardiomyocytes
human myocardium was cut in approximately 1 mm3 thin pieces
while being incubated in single cell media (containing nah2po4
0.33 mm, nacl 135 mm, kcl 4 mm, hepes 10 mm, mgcl2 1 mm,
glucose 10 mm at ph 7.3). the media was changed every 3 min. after
addition of isolation media 1 (12 mg collagenase type ii + 2 mg
protease type 24 in 10 ml single cell media) cells were incubated for
20 min under o2-gasing at 37 °c. subsequently, cells were washed
twice with single cell media. cells were incubated at 37 °c with
isolation media 2 (10 mg collagenase type ii in 10 ml single cell
media) for 10 min. the supernatant was tested for dead cells using the
microscope axiovert 25 from zeiss (jena, germany). after centrifugation of the supernatant (5 min at 800 ×g) the resulting supernatant
was resuspended in 1 ml acetone for max. 1 min. after a second
centrifugation step cells were resuspended in pbs. this suspension
was again centrifuged at 800 ×g for 5 min and the prepared
cardiomyocytes were resolved in 500 mul pbs for another microscopic
control.
2.7. immunohistochemical preparation
cardiomyocytes were washed 3 × 10 min with tbs and incubated
for 20 min with 20 ml methanol + 5 ml 3% h2o2 in order to block
endogenous peroxidase. after 2 × 10 min of washing with tbs,
washing with 0.5 m ammonium chloride + 0.25% triton x in tbs for
10 min was performed. this step promotes the release of antigen and
increases the cell membrane permeability. two further washing steps
(10 min in tbs) were followed by 60 min charge neutralization in 5%
bsa solution. cells were incubated overnight at 4 °c with the
respective ﬁrst antibody (mck1 1:200, mcb2 1:200 or anti-ted
1:100 + 0.8% bsa in tbs). for negative control experiments only 0.8%
bsa in tbs was added. the next day after several washing steps the
cells were incubated for 60 min with the secondary antibody
(biotinylated anti-mouse igg-antibody, 1:400 in tbs). after 4 × 10
min washing with tbs cells were incubated for 60 min with
horseradish peroxidase-complex (1:150 in tbs) and washed again.
peroxidase activity was measured using the dab (diaminobenzidine)
method. after successful staining, which was microscopically controlled, cells were put in xylol and embedded using entellan®.

cardiomyocytes were visualized using the axiovert 25 (magniﬁcation
40×).
2.8. statistical analysis
data are expressed as means ± standard error of means (s.e.m.).
group comparisons were analyzed by student's t-test (graph pad
prism, version 4). values with p < 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant. in order to calculate the ic50 values the dissociation
constant (kd) of digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , beta-acetyldigoxin, methyldigoxin
and ouabain for each isoform in the absence or presence of k+ were
calculated according to the equation of johnson et al. using graph pad
prism version 4 (each n = 5) (johnson et al., 1995).
3. results
3.1. speciﬁc expression of isoforms of na+,k+-atpase in yeast
human brain contains all three isoforms of na+,k+-atpase, while
human kidney tissue contains only the alpha1beta1 isoform. therefore, in the
western blot experiments human brain and human kidney preparations were used as positive controls and non-transfected yeast extract
as negative control. we used the monoclonal igg1  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -antibody
(mck1) and the monoclonal igg1  xxxg831xxx -antibody (mcb2) as well as the
polyclonal  xxxg832xxx -antibody (anti-ted) as ﬁrst antibodies and appropriate
horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies. as expected
we found all three isoforms in human brain tissue but only  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  in
human kidney (fig. 2). no signal was found in the non-transfected
yeast cells. these results show that our detecting system was valid
and speciﬁc for detection of na+,k+-atpase isoforms. fig. 2 also
shows that transfection had been performed successfully and the
isoforms were speciﬁcally expressed in yeast cell clones. after
treatment with the respective isoform speciﬁc antibody only the
expected bands were detected. in accordance with previous ﬁndings
of our group similar expression levels were found for  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and  xxxg832xxx 
whereas the expression of  xxxg831xxx  was somewhat lower (müller-ehmsen
et al., 2001a). in summary, the western blots showed that the
prepared clones allowed isoform speciﬁc observations for human
na+,k+-atpase.
3.2. ouabain binding experiments in yeast membranes
binding experiments of radioactive [³h]-ouabain (20 nm) for each
 xxxd2799xxx  (digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , beta-acetyldigoxin, methyldigoxin
and ouabain) in increasing concentrations (0–40 nm) for each of the
three isoforms were performed. the results could be ﬁtted into onesite competition curves. fig. 3 shows the binding curves of digoxin to
the three na+,k+-atpase isoforms as a representative example of the
original data. in this case, the curve for  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  binding was shifted towards
higher concentrations and therefore increased kd values compared to
 xxxg831xxx  and  xxxg832xxx . the comparison of all kd values is shown in fig. 4 a–e. the
results demonstrate that several of the cardiac glycosides possess
different afﬁnities to the three isoforms of na+,k+-atpase (fig. 4 a–e).
in the absence of k+ digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx  and beta-acetyldigoxin showed no
isoform speciﬁc afﬁnities, in contrast to methyldigoxin and ouabain.
methyldigoxin had a higher afﬁnity to  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  (p < 0.01 vs.  xxxg831xxx  and  xxxg832xxx ) and
ouabain to  xxxg831xxx  (p < 0.01 vs.  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and  xxxg832xxx ). it is of note that the maximal
binding capacities were higher in yeast membranes that contained
alpha1beta1 or alpha3beta1 heterodimers than in those that contained the alpha2beta1
heteromers (bmax 4.95 ± 2.8 vs. 1.32 ± 0.5 vs. 4.51 ± 2.6 pmol/mg
protein, p < 0.001).
the presence of k+ decreased the afﬁnity of all 5 cardiac glycosides
to the human na+,k+-atpase as expected (fig. 4 a–e). a signiﬁcant
isoform speciﬁc difference of afﬁnity could now be found for digoxin
and beta-acetyldigoxin. digoxin had a lower afﬁnity to  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  + k+ (p < 0.05
vs.  xxxg831xxx  + k+ and  xxxg832xxx  + k+, fig. 4) and beta-acetyldigoxin to  xxxg832xxx  + k+

fig. 3. example of a competition curve of a  xxxd2799xxx  with [³h]-ouabain (20 nm)
binding in yeast expressed na+,k+-atpase isoforms. one representative competition
curve of digoxin for each isoform alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 is shown. the experiments were
performed in the presence and absence of k+ and besides digoxin for all other clinically
used cardiac glycosides  xxxd1884xxx , beta-acetyldigoxin, methyldigoxin and ouabain. using
these curves the respective dissociation constants (kd) were calculated.

(p < 0.01 vs.  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  + k+, fig. 4).  xxxd1884xxx  showed no isoform speciﬁc
afﬁnity in the absence or in the presence of k+ (fig. 4 b).
3.3. comparison of kd of the different cardiac glycosides
the comparison of the kd values of digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , beta-acetyldigoxin,
methyldigoxin, and ouabain for each isoform in the presence or absence of
k+ revealed highly signiﬁcant differences between the glycosides (fig. 5
a–f and table 1). in the absence of k+ beta-acetyldigoxin showed a
signiﬁcant lower afﬁnity to alpha1compared to  xxxd1884xxx  and ouabain (fig. 5 a
and table 1). concerning  xxxg831xxx  in the absence of k+, methyldigoxin
possesses the lowest afﬁnity and the differences to all other cardiac
glycosides were highly signiﬁcant (fig. 5 b and table 1). the afﬁnity to  xxxg832xxx 
in the absence of k+ was signiﬁcantly different among digoxin and
ouabain and also among beta-acetyldigoxin and ouabain (fig. 5 c and
table 1).
under more physiological conditions in the presence of k+, digoxin
showed the lowest afﬁnity for  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  of all cardiac glycosides studied
(p < 0.001, fig. 5 d and table 1). ouabain had the highest afﬁnity
reaching the level of signiﬁcance compared with beta-acetyldigoxin and
methyldigoxin (and of course digoxin), but not  xxxd1884xxx  (fig. 5 d and
table 1). for the afﬁnity to  xxxg831xxx  in the presence of k+, our experiments
revealed the highest afﬁnity for ouabain and the lowest for
methyldigoxin with signiﬁcant or highly signiﬁcant differences to
the other cardiac glycosides (fig. 5 e and table 1). the experiments in
the presence of k+ showed for the  xxxg832xxx  isoform that beta-acetyldigoxin had
the lowest afﬁnity (signiﬁcant vs. digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx  and ouabain, but
not methyldigoxin), and again ouabain had the highest afﬁnity.
methyldigoxin had a lower afﬁnity than digoxin and ouabain, and
 xxxd1884xxx  had a lower afﬁnity than ouabain. thus, the order of afﬁnities
among cardiac glycosides differs from isoform to isoform.
3.4. immunohistochemical staining and subcellular localization of
na+,k+-atpase isoforms
the immunoﬂuorescence staining of single cell cardiomyocytes
showed an accumulation of antibody in the plasma membrane, t-tubuli,
and intracellular membranes (fig. 6 a–c). all three isoforms of the human
na+,k+-atpase were located at the plasma membrane and intracellular
membranes of the cardiomyocyte (fig. 6 a–c). however, only alpha1beta1 and
alpha2beta1, but not alpha3beta1, were also located in the t-tubuli (fig. 6 a+b).

fig. 4. kd in nm ± s.e.m. of digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , beta-acetyldigoxin, methyldigoxin and
ouabain in the absence and presence of k+ (each n = 5). kd was calculated based on the
equation of johnson et al. all results are summarized in table 1.

4. discussion
the aim of the study was to investigate if clinically used cardiac
glycosides differ in na+,k+-atpase isoform speciﬁc afﬁnities, and to
analyze if isoforms of the na+,k+-atpase have a speciﬁc subcellular
localization in human cardiac myocytes. the main ﬁndings of the
present study are that in the absence of k+ the two cardiac glycosides
methyldigoxin and ouabain in fact show isoform speciﬁcity, and that
in the presence of k+ two other cardiac glycosides (digoxin and betaacetyldigoxin) have isoform speciﬁc afﬁnities. furthermore, the
isoforms showed different proﬁles regarding their afﬁnities towards
the different cardiac glycosides, and we found evidence that the
isoforms of the human na+,k+-atpase have a different subcellular
localization within the human cardiac myocyte. thus, in contrast to

fig. 5. comparison of the ﬁve cardiac glycosides digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , beta-acetyldigoxin, methyldigoxin and ouabain for all three isoforms ( xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx ,  xxxg831xxx  and  xxxg832xxx ) as kd in nm ± s.e.m. in the
absence or presence of k+ (each n = 5).

what has been thought for a long time, it seems that cardiac glycosides
have different pharmacological proﬁles and are not simply exchangeable. in addition, the different subcellular distribution of na+,k+-atpase
isoforms may indicate that the different isoforms of human na+,k+atpase may indeed have a different physiological function, as previously
postulated for mice (james et al., 1999).
the results of the radioligand binding experiments in the absence
of k+ showed that besides ouabain, which was already known to have
some isoform speciﬁcity (müller-ehmsen et al., 2001a), only
methyldigoxin among the other cardiac glycosides has an isoform
speciﬁc afﬁnity proﬁle. interestingly, the isoform speciﬁc afﬁnity proﬁles
changed in the presence of k+ with digoxin and beta-acetyldigoxin
showing isoform speciﬁc properties under these more physiological

conditions. such inﬂuence of k+ could at least partly be explained with
the different afﬁnities of k+ to the na+,k+-atpase isoforms which were
previously found in heterologous expressed na+,k+-atpase isoforms
(yeast, xenopus oocytes) (müller-ehmsen et al. 2001a; crambert et al.,
2000). in yeast k+ had a higher afﬁnity to  xxxg831xxx  than  xxxg832xxx  and  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  (kd:
0.5 mm vs. 2.5 mm and 3 mm). thus, in the presence of a constant
concentration of k+ (as in our experiments, but also as in the human
body) the afﬁnities of the cardiac glycosides towards  xxxg831xxx  should decrease
the most, and this should be the case for all cardiac glycosides. however,
this was not the case, e.g. for digoxin the afﬁnity shift in the presence vs.
the absence of k+ was most pronounced for the  xxxg831xxx  isoform, while for
 xxxd1884xxx  it was most pronounced for  xxxg832xxx . therefore, substance speciﬁc
interactions with the isoforms in the presence of k+ seem to play a role.

fig. 6. immunhistochemical preparations (magniﬁcation: 40×) of isolated cardiomyocytes after treatment with isoform speciﬁc antibodies (mck1 1:200, mcb2 1:200 or anti-ted
1:100) and biotinylated anti-mouse igg-antibody. fig. 5d shows the negative control. one representative of 3 experiments is shown for each isoform.

lingrel et al. hypothesized that in mutant  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  na+,k+-atpase different
afﬁnities between digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  could be explained by hydrogen
bond forming between the hydroxyl group at c-12 of digoxin and cys108 of the enzyme but they also could not rule out other molecular
interactions such as dipole interaction or van der waals forces (askew
and lingrel, 1994). the differences we found could possibly as well be
explained by dipole interactions or van der waals forces between the
isozymes and the cardiac glycosides. however, the exact molecular
mechanism remains unknown.
the kd-ranges we observed for the cardiac glycosides binding to
the isoforms are all within one order of magnitude. mostly, they are
within a factor of 2–4, and the greatest difference is for alpha1beta1 in the
presence of k+ which is bound at 6-fold lower concentrations by
ouabain (kd 19 nm) as compared to digoxin (kd 110 nm). however,
also these rather small differences might be of clinical relevance given
the steep concentration-dependent binding of the glycosides.
the clinical relevance of the observed differences between the
cardiac glycosides depends on the distinct isoform speciﬁc function. to
date the function of the isoforms is still unclear, and in case of
functionally equivalent isoforms, our ﬁnding of different isoform
binding proﬁles of the glycosides might be without clinical consequence. however, it seems extremely unlikely that the presence of
different isoforms and their distribution occurs in a random fashion,
since different na+,k+-atpase isoforms are found in completely
unrelated species such as mammals, birds, crustaceans, platyhelminths,
etc. (blanco and mercer, 1998). it is believed that the ubiquitous alpha1beta1isozyme could have the role of the housekeeping na+,k+-atpase
whereas alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 could mediate more tissue speciﬁc tasks. in
neurons where all three isoforms are expressed alpha3beta1 with its relatively
lower afﬁnity to cations seems to function as a spare pump which will
only be activated during depolarisation (blanco and mercer, 1998).
another indicator for isoform speciﬁc function can be found during
development where a change in the relative amount of na+,k+-atpase
isoforms takes place. for example, in rat hearts, a switch from  xxxg832xxx  to  xxxg831xxx  as
the dominant isoform was found between weeks two and three of life
(blanco and mercer, 1998). in humans, na+,k+-atpase isoforms are
speciﬁcally regulated in response to diseases such as heart failure,
indicating that they may deﬁnitely play speciﬁc functional roles in
humans (schwinger et al., 1999a,b; müller-ehmsen et al., 2001b;
müller-ehmsen et al., 2002).
in human heart three different isoforms of the na+,k+-atpase:
alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 are expressed (wang et al., 1996). previous studies

showed that a speciﬁc regulation of these enzymes occurs during heart
failure (müller-ehmsen et al., 2001b; schwinger et al., 1999a,b).
regarding subcellular localization as a possible indicator for an isoform
speciﬁc function, mcdonough et al. showed a distribution of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and  xxxg831xxx 
in the t-tubuli and the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes of rats and
guinea pigs. in rat cardiomyocytes the staining of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  in t-tubuli seemed
to be slightly increased suggesting an accumulation of this isoform in
this region (mcdonough et al., 1996). we could now show for the ﬁrst
time the different subcellular localization of the na+,k+-atpase
isoforms in human cardiomyocytes. our experiments revealed for the
 xxxg832xxx -isoform a differing distribution compared to the two other isoforms:
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and  xxxg831xxx  were located at the t-tubuli, whereas  xxxg832xxx  was not. all isoforms
were equally found in the plasma membrane. interestingly,  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and  xxxg831xxx 
showed the same subcellular localization like in rat ventricular
cardiomyocytes (mcdonough et al., 1996).
the group of lingrel et al. hypothesized previously, that in mice
the action of cardiac glycosides is only mediated by the isoform alpha2beta1
(james et al., 1999). in more recent work with knock-in-mice with
genetically engineered ouabain sensitive  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx - and ouabain resistant
 xxxg831xxx -isoforms, they seem to question their own theory of a  xxxg831xxx -mediated
 xxxd2799xxx  effect in mice (dostanic et al., 2004). however, in
wild type rodents it is not feasible to demonstrate an isoform speciﬁc
functional role by using cardiac glycosides due to the insensitivity of
the alpha1beta1-isoform to them (dostanic et al., 2004). since mice do not
express  xxxg832xxx , also no conclusions on the role of this isoform can be
drawn from their study.
taking our results of the different subcellular localization and the
ﬁndings of other groups together this might lead to the assumption of
a, yet unclear, speciﬁc physiological function of the isoforms and
eventually also to different roles of the isoforms in  xxxd2799xxx 
action. under this presumption the observed differences in isoform
speciﬁcity among clinically used cardiac glycosides could in fact gain
relevance for the treatment of patients. if the drug action is not
mediated via all isoforms equally, a substance that inhibits the
relevant isoform(s) more potently than the others would probably be
the best choice for treatment.
in summary, clinically used cardiac glycosides show distinct
isoform speciﬁc afﬁnities to na+,k+-atpase isoforms. the binding
afﬁnities reﬂect the inhibitory potencies of the agents, and we
conclude that, if the isoforms have different functions in the human
heart, the different cardiac glycosides cannot be regarded as
equivalent agents. in support of isoform speciﬁc function we found

14

c. hauck et al. / european journal of pharmacology 622 (2009) 7–14

that the na+,k+-atpase isoforms have different subcellular localizations in human cardiac myocytes. the present study demonstrates
ﬁrst evidence that, in contrast of current clinical practice, the different
cardiac glycosides might differ under pharmacological and clinical
aspects.
