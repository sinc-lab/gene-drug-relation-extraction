 xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ®) is a novel recombinant fusion protein consisting of peptide
sequences for the enzymatically active and membrane translocation domain of
diphtheria toxin linked to human il-2.  xxxd1832xxx  specifically binds to il-2 receptors
on the cell membrane, is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and inhibits
protein synthesis by adp ribosylation of  xxxg679xxx , resulting in cell death. this
article focuses on the clinical trial that led to the us fda approval of the drug for cutaneous
t-cell lymphoma in 1999, and other investigational studies for hematologic malignancies,
recurrent and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-hodgkin b-cell lymphoma,
graft-versus-host disease and autoimmune disease, demonstrating the activity and
adverse effects of the drug.

 xxxd1832xxx  (eisai, nj, usa) is a genetically engineered recombinant fusion protein
composed of the full-length il-2 and the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin. in the original
molecule, dab486il-2, the receptor-binding
domain of diphtheria toxin, is replaced with il-2
amino acids 2–133, joined in-frame to ala-486
of diphtheria fragment b [1]. the improved version, known as dab389il-2 (or its trade name
 xxxd1832xxx ®) has il-2 joined in-frame to ala-389.
 xxxd1832xxx  was developed by seragen (ma, usa)
and bought by ligand pharmaceuticals, inc.
(ca, usa). it is the first targeted therapy in the
fusion-toxin class to be approved by the us fda
for use in humans. fusion-toxin-targeted therapy has broad applicability, as any ligand that
binds to a membrane receptor could be
employed as a target. denileukin diftitoxin differs in mechanism from the currently available
antibodies targeting hematopoietic cells, that is,
rituximab (which targets cd20+ b cells) and
alemtuzumab (which targets  xxxg393xxx + cells) [2].
 xxxd1832xxx  was first introduced in
1992, and was tested for safety and activity in
autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis
and psoriasis), type i diabetes, hiv and hematologic malignancies [3]. the initial fusion protein,
dab486il-2, was tested in a phase i trial of
hematologic malignancies [4]. it was later modified to create dab389il-2, which is cleared more
slowly, with a longer half-life of 72 min [5]. on
the basis of a randomized, two-arm, phase iii
multicenter clinical trial,  xxxd1832xxx 
received fda approval in 1999 for cutaneous
t-cell lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ), with an overall
response rate (orr) of 30%, including a complete response (cr) rate of 10% [6]. in the last

10 years,  xxxd1832xxx  has been shown to
have efficacy in peripheral t-cell lymphomas
(ptcls), b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma
(nhl), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll)
and graft-versus-host disease (gvhd), and
against the regulatory t cells (tregs) present in
solid tumors.
defining  xxxg2343xxx  & the target

cutaneous t-cell lymphomas are a group of
extranodal nhls that are present in the skin,
but may progress to systemic lymphomas. the
most common  xxxg2343xxx  is mycosis fungoides (mf)
and its related, leukemic variant, sézary syndrome (ss) [7]. less common variants include
 xxxg2302xxx + anaplastic t-cell lymphoma spectrum,
unspecified ptcl, subcutaneous panniculitic
t-cell lymphomas and others. the most recent
overall annual age-adjusted incidence of  xxxg2343xxx 
is 6.4 per million persons, with a higher incidence in blacks than whites [8]. in most patients,
mf begins as an indolent and persistent eczematous or psoriasiform dermatitis, which can be
treated by skin-directed modalities [9]. however,
in patients who progress or transform, aggressive
chemotherapy treatment can further compromise the immune system and can lead to fatal
infection. thus, for this disease, therapy targeting only the malignant t cells specifically would
represent an advance in the treatment strategy.
mf is thought to arise from an accumulation
of skin homing or epidermotropic helper/memory t cells, initiated by chronic antigen stimulation, that become resistant to activation-induced
cell death [10]. t cells that encounter antigens or
superantigens through their t-cell receptor
become activated, upregulate their surface

expression of the  xxxg1175xxx  ( xxxg1175xxx ), and proliferate to produce a clonal t-cell expansion.
clonal expansion of t cells can be detected by
pcr amplification of the t-cell gamma- or beta-variable
chain regions. the same clonal rearrangement of
their t-cell receptors from different sites or over
time may indicate patients most likely to experience disease progression over time [11].  xxxd1832xxx  targets t cells that are activated and
express il-2rs on their surface.
the high-affinity t-cell receptor is formed by
a trimer of three distinct protein chains: the
55-kda alpha-subunit of cd25; the 75-kda beta-subunit of  xxxg1175xxx ; and the 64-kda gamma-subunit of
 xxxg1176xxx  [12]. waldmann first targeted the  xxxg1175xxx 
with an anti-tac antibody. he also first showed
that the  xxxg1175xxx  is expressed on activated and
htlv-1-infected t cells, but not on resting t
and b cells [13].  xxxd1832xxx  binds to the
 xxxg1175xxx  expressed on the cell surface, but its mechanism of action differs from that of monoclonal
antibodies in that it is a fusion protein that must
be internalized into the cell in order to have
activity. following binding of  xxxd1832xxx 
via the il-2 ligand to the  xxxg1175xxx , the fusion protein is internalized by endocytosis. the active
fragment of diphtheria toxin is released into the
cytosol following cleavage, and inhibits protein
synthesis through adp ribosylation and causes
cell death [14].  xxxd1832xxx  can bind to
any of the receptor isoforms, but only the intermediate- ( xxxg1175xxx  and  xxxg1176xxx ) and high-affinity (cd25,  xxxg1175xxx  and  xxxg1176xxx ) receptors are
able to internalize  xxxd1832xxx , which is
essential for its cytotoxicity.
pharmacokinetics &
pharmacodynamics

pharmacokinetics associated with denileukin
diftitox has been determined over a range of
doses (3–31 µg/kg/day) in patients with lymphoma.  xxxd1832xxx  was administered as
an intravenous (iv.) infusion following the schedule used in the clinical trials. following the first
dose,  xxxd1832xxx  displayed two-compartment behavior, with a distribution phase (halflife ∼2–5 min) and a terminal phase (half-life
approximately 70–80 min). systemic exposure
was variable but proportional to dose. clearance
was approximately 1.5–2.0 ml/min/kg and the
volume of distribution was similar to that of circulating blood (0.06–0.08 l/kg). no accumulation was evident between the first and fifth
doses. development of antibodies to denileukin
diftitox has been shown to significantly impact
458

future oncol. (2008) 4(4)

clearance rates. gender, age and race were introduced into a multivariate analysis with various
pharmacokinetic parameters. the limited available data revealed no statistical relationships
between these variables [5].
dosage & administration

the drug is supplied as a frozen (-10°c) sterile
solution formulated in citrate buffer in 2-ml single-use vials at a concentration of 150 µg/ml.
 xxxd1832xxx  is administered as a
9–18-µg/kg/day iv. infusion over at least
30–45 min every day for 5 consecutive days,
once every 21 days. premedication is often
given prior to infusion and may include prednisone 10 mg (or other corticosteroid), an antiemetic such as ondansetron 8 mg, acetoaminophen 650 mg and diphenhydramine
25 mg. we have also found that hydration with
normal saline or albumen following the infusion may reduce the incidence or severity of
subsequent capillary-leak syndrome.
clinical efficacy & safety
clinical trials

in the first phase i multicenter dose-escalation
trial,  xxxd1832xxx  was administered to
109 patients with hematologic malignancies [5].
expression of the  xxxg1175xxx  subunit cd25 by
immunohistochemistry (ihc) staining of freshfrozen tissue was required for study entry. a
higher number of  xxxg2343xxx  patients, compared
with patients with hodgkin lymphoma or nhl,
were found to have the receptor, which was
detected by staining for the  xxxd924xxx  (cd25) or p75
( xxxg1175xxx ) subunits [5]. in total, 73 patients
(44 men and 29 women), aged 16–81 years
(mean: 50.7 years) with  xxxg2343xxx  (n = 35), nhl
(n = 17) and hodgkin lymphoma (n = 21),
who had failed 0–15 previous therapies
(median: four therapies), were treated.  xxxd1832xxx  was administered as short iv. infusions daily for 5 days and courses were repeated
every 21 days. patients received 1–6 courses
(mean: 3.3) of  xxxd1832xxx , with doses of
3–31 µg/kg/day. asthenia was the dose-limiting
toxicity at a maximum tolerated dose of
27 µg/kg/day. half of all patients developed significant antibody titers to diphtheria toxin or to
 xxxd1832xxx  at the time of enrollment
compared with 92% with titers at the end of
treatment, but antibodies did not block clinical
responses. among the 32  xxxg2343xxx  patients, five
crs and eight partial responses (prs) were
observed for an encouraging orr of 38% [14,15].
future science group

optimizing  xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ®) therapy – drug

one cr and two prs were seen in patients with
nhl, but none of the patients with hodgkin
lymphoma responded. median time to response
was 2 months and duration of response was
2–39+ months [5].
the observation of efficacy and cr seen in
 xxxg2343xxx  patients was the basis for the design of
two larger multicenter, randomized, phase iii
trials for registration of  xxxd1832xxx . the
first phase iii trial was successfully conducted in
patients with stage ib–iva  xxxg2343xxx  who had
received a median of five prior therapies, and led
to accelerated approval [6]. patients required
biopsy-proven  xxxg2343xxx  expressing cd25 on 20%
or more of lymphocytes. patients (n = 35 or 36,
respectively) were randomized to receive infusions of either 9 or 18 µg/kg/day of denileukin
diftitox administered for 5 consecutive days every
3 weeks for up to eight cycles. an overall objective response of 30% (21 out of 71), with 20%
prs and 10% crs, was observed. response was
measured by the skin-weighted assessment tool
and required two visits 3 weeks apart to confirm
response. many patients had clinical responses
but discontinued the study early following acute
infusion reactions, and did not have responses
confirmed at two visits, as required by the protocol. the response rate and duration of response,
based on the time of the first dose of study drug
for all responders (median: 6.9 months; range:
2.7–46.1+ months), were not statistically different between the two doses. however, in patients
with tumor stage disease (iib), the response rate
was 38% at the higher dose level compared with
10% at the lower dose (p = 0.07). the orr in
early patients (stage i) was 43% at 9 µg/kg/day
and 33% at the higher dose level. one patient
with stage ia disease treated in the study
achieved cr for the past 5 years following
 xxxd1832xxx  therapy [16].
a phase iii study has been conducted in early
patients who had received less than three prior
therapies. it included randomization to a placebo
arm and has been slow in accruing patients [17].
cutaneous t-cell lymphomas can be both disfiguring and highly symptomatic. as part of the
trial, overall quality of life was assessed at each
cycle using the functional assessment of cancer
therapy-general (fact-g) questionnaire, skin
appearance (7-point scale) and pruritus severity
(10-cm visual-analog scale) [18]. composite
fact-g and most individual subscale scores
(physical, social/family, emotional and functional wellbeing) in documented responders
(n = 21) gradually increased during the study

period and generally reached statistical significance (p < 0.05) by the third cycle. the scores of
the responding patients were significantly higher
than the scores of nonresponders at end point
(p ≤ 0.041). responders also assessed their skin
severity and pruritus as having significant
improvement (p ≤ 0.05) at the study end point
compared with baseline [18].
a requirement for accelerated approval of
 xxxd1832xxx  was to confirm efficacy and
demonstrate clinical benefit in a randomized,
placebo-controlled phase iii trial. this trial
(ligand l4389-11) investigated  xxxd1832xxx  at doses of 9 or 18 µg/kg/day in  xxxg2343xxx 
patients who had stage ia–iii cd25+ disease
and had received three or fewer prior therapies.
the primary end point was the orr, defined as
the percentage of patients with confirmed prs,
crs or clinical crs. secondary and supportive
end points assessed clinical benefit. pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity were also evaluated. both  xxxd1832xxx  treatment arms
were statistically superior to placebo in a dosedependent fashion, with orrs of 49.1 and
37.8% for 18- or 9-µg doses, respectively, compared with 15.9% for placebo. all secondary end
points showed a significant difference from placebo. most notably, progression-free survival was
more than 971 days for the 18-µg denileukin
diftitox dosing group, versus 124 days for
placebo. no differences in serious adverse events
were observed between the 9- and 18-µg treatment arms, and the only significantly different
grade 3/4 adverse event was nausea (2% placebo,
15% 18-µg dosing group) [19].
side effects of  xxxd1832xxx 

in the pivotal trial, premedications were limited
to acetaminophen and diphenhydramine only [6].
systemic steroids were not allowed and many
patients experienced acute infusion reactions,
causing early withdrawal from the trial [6]. the
severity and number of side effects were not
associated with the dose levels. adverse events
consisted of flu-like symptoms (fever/chills,
nausea/vomiting and myalgias/arthralgias), and
acute infusion-related events (hypotension, dyspnea, chest pain and back pain) were seen in
69% of the patients and were responsible for
29% of patients leaving the trial early. chest and
back pain and shortness of breath were relieved
by slowing the rate of infusion. vascular-leak
syndrome (vls; retrospectively defined as the
occurrence of two of three of: hypotension,
hypoalbuminemia or edema) was experienced in
459

drug evaluation – duvic & talpur

27% of the patients and occurred approximately
10 days after the first infusion. vls generally
was limited to the first or second infusion course
and did not recur. in our experience, having vls
was associated with an excellent therapeutic antitumor effect, perhaps because t cells are perivascular in mf lesions and are targeted by this
therapy. hypoalbuminemia without full-blown
vls was also observed in 79% of patients,
including 15% with grade 3 or 4 changes. in
total, 61% of patients experienced transient elevations of hepatic transaminase levels and 17%
were grade 3 or 4. hypersensitivity rashes were
seen in some patients, but could be followed by
clearing of skin lesions. there was no evidence of
cumulative toxicity and no association between
response and formation of antibodies. infection
rate was not increased and no myelosuppression
was seen.
 xxxd1832xxx  is used in the outpatient
setting and safely administered through a peripheral line. if possible, permanent indwelling
catheters are to be avoided in mf/ss patients,
whose carriage rate for staphylococcus aureus is
41% [20]. acute allergic reactions, including fever
and chills, are mostly blocked or reduced by premedicating patients with low doses of prednisone (10–20 mg) or dexamethasone (1–2 mg)
prior to each infusion. in a small study of
15 patients, steroid premedication was associated with a higher response rate of 60% and
fewer acute infusion reactions [21]. only three of
15 patients experienced infusion reactions and
two had vls. steroids may induce the expression of cd25 on t cells, making denileukin
diftitox more effective, or may have activity of
their own. saline infusion and hydration following  xxxd1832xxx  infusions also appear to
reduce the incidence of vls, although a blinded
study has not been attempted.
in the pivotal trial, we observed one individual
who experienced acute thyrotoxicosis, presenting as
infusion-related tachycardia and hypertension [6].
additional patients were observed who had
transient thyroiditis with subsequent hypothyroidism. this suggests a need for monitoring
thyroid function in patients receiving denileukin
diftitox [22].  xxxd330xxx  has also been administered in conjunction with  xxxd1832xxx  and
may be associated with increased il-2 expression
and possible synergy [23,24]. foss et al. reported a
67% orr in patients who received a combination of low-dose  xxxd330xxx  followed by  xxxd1832xxx  [24]. they also showed that low
doses of  xxxd330xxx  are capable of modulating
460

future oncol. (2008) 4(4)

expression of cd25 in t cells in vivo. talpur
et al. reported a case in which the patient had
resolution of her lymphadenopathy and marked
skin improvement following  xxxd1832xxx 
[23]. the remaining patch/plaque disease has
been well controlled with use of oral  xxxd330xxx , interferon and puva for over 4 years,
without unacceptable toxicity.
patients who have been treated with both
 xxxd1832xxx  and  xxxd330xxx  may require
further synthroid therapy if  xxxd330xxx  is
discontinued.
visual changes following  xxxd1832xxx 
have been reported in nine patients. one of our
patients with a history of autoimmune uveitis
experienced flashing light following their infusion (m duvic, university of texas, tx, usa. unpublished
data). a 69-year-old female with nodules and
transient ischemic attacks on her second day of
infusion developed darkening of her visual
fields in both eyes, which was attributed to posterior ischemic optic neuropathy [25]. her
tumor nodules regressed and 1 month after
treatment she developed bilateral optic nerve
pallor temporally. her vision slowly improved
over the next 2 years. patients’ eye symptoms
should be monitored carefully.
correlation of cd25 status with patients’
response to  xxxd1832xxx 
cd25 (alpha-chain) is the low-affinity subunit of

the  xxxg1175xxx . the high-affinity receptor, which is
best for internalizing  xxxd1832xxx , must
express all three chains (alpha, beta and gamma); however,
antibodies used for ihc detection of the  xxxg1175xxx 
are available only for cd25. in the pivotal trial
in our patients’ skin biopsies, variable levels of
cd25 by ihc were seen among biopsies taken
from the same patient from different lesions
and over the course of the study [6]. patients
whose lesions no longer showed cd25 staining
were still able to respond to  xxxd1832xxx .
the cd25 antibody may not detect low numbers of il-2rs, which may be enough for
malignant cells to respond. in order to study
the value of cd25 immunoreactivity for
predicting response to  xxxd1832xxx , we
prospectively stained lesional skin biopsy specimens from 113 mf and ss patients for activation markers cd25 and  xxxg2302xxx  [26]. we
proposed to correlate expression with clinical
tumor-node metastasis stage, histologic grade
and response to  xxxd1832xxx . high
expression was defined as positivity of 20% or
more of lesional t cells using ihc. we found
future science group

optimizing  xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ®) therapy – drug

that cd25 and  xxxg2302xxx  expression were more
commonly expressed in the cellular infiltrates
of lesions from advanced-stage patients compared with early patients’ lesions – stages
ia–iia (p = 0.04 and 0.002, respectively).
advanced tumor-node metastasis (t3 or t4)
stage biopsies were significantly associated with
intermediate-grade (p = 0.002) and large-cell
transformation histology (p = 0.04). in this
study, clinical responses to  xxxd1832xxx 
were observed in 78.5% of patients with high
cd25 expression, compared with 20% with
low to undetectable cd25 expression (p = 0.01)
in 24 of our patients treated with standard
5-day infusions of  xxxd1832xxx  at
18 µg/kg/day. when the same biopsy specimens were divided and analyzed by the study
reference laboratory or using a local assay for
cd25, which is performed on fixed tissue,
discordant results were seen in over half of the
patients’ biopsies.
we have further retrospectively reviewed the
outcomes of 48 mf/ss patients evaluated at
md anderson cancer center (tx, usa)
between 1996 and 2006 who received at least
one cycle of  xxxd1832xxx , administered iv.
for 5 days every 21 days at 9 or 18 µg/kg per day
[27]. skin biopsies taken prior to treatment were
fixed and stained by an assay developed locally,
and examples are shown in figure 1. in this analysis, 22 males and 26 females with a median age
of 61 years (range: 20–80 years) had received a
median of three (range: 1–8) previous therapies.
overall, prs were seen in 23 (48%) out of all
treated patients. however, 18 out of 28 (64%)
patients whose biopsies showed over 20%
cd25+ immunostaining of the infiltrates
responded compared with five out of 20 (25%)
patients whose baseline biopsies showed lower
expression of cd25 (p = 0.01, fisher’s exact
test). overall survival (os) was compared
between groups using log-rank tests. there were
no differences in survival by race (p = 0.90) or
gender (p = 0.76). patients with ss (n = 15) who
received  xxxd1832xxx  had a significantly
shorter median os of 1.2 years compared with
other advanced mf patients (n = 33; p = 0.045).
os was significantly associated with stage as follows: four out of four stage i–iia patients are
alive compared with nine out of 15 stage iib,
three out of three stage iii and 13 out of 25 stage
iv patients (p = 0.021). patients who had
received two or three prior therapies before
 xxxd1832xxx  had better survival (six out of
17 died) compared with patients who had

received no or one prior therapy (median os:
2.8 years) or three or more therapies (median:
1.2 years) (p = 0.019). adverse events of any
grade included vascular- or capillary-leak syndrome (42%), fatigue (33%), nausea (31%), elevated transaminases (21%), rash (14%),
thyroiditis (4%) and retinal detachment (2%).
in our experience,  xxxd1832xxx  is an
effective therapy for advanced  xxxg2343xxx  patients
who would otherwise need chemotherapy.
examples of two patients whose tumors or
plaques were successfully debulked with  xxxd1832xxx  are shown in figures 2 & 3. these
data suggest that higher cd25 expression is
associated with advanced stages of mf and with
higher response rates to  xxxd1832xxx 
therapy of over 60% if lesional infiltrates
express over 20%  xxxg1174xxx  at baseline.
os following  xxxd1832xxx  was lower in
ss patients and in patients receiving more than
three prior therapies.
a multicenter, investigator-initiated trial has
also been conducted to assess the importance of
cd25 in predicting response to  xxxd1832xxx  [17]. this study used the same ihc methodology as in the pivotal phase iii trial [6]. orr
was 51% (29 out of 57), with 27 prs and two
crs. there was no statistical difference in
response rate for those patients whose tumor
sample tested cd25+ (53%) versus cd25(43%). in addition, overall adverse events incidence or quality was not statistically different
between cd25+ and cd25- cohorts. a companion trial (l4389-14) to the phase iii l438911 study also assessed response to denileukin
diftitox according to cd25 ihc testing status.
the orr for those patients whose tumor assay
tested negative for cd25 was 30.6% (11 out of
36), versus 47.1% (16 out of 34) for a cd25+
cohort [28]. some of the issues relating to detection are the threshold level of receptor expression, difficulty in obtaining representative
tissue, lack of an assay that accurately reflects
high-affinity receptor, and the potential difficulty of observer variability in evaluating the
assays [29]. at this point it is clear that not all
assays for cd25 are equal, and patients whose
cells do not show high expression may respond
to therapy with  xxxd1832xxx .
selection of other  xxxg2343xxx  patients for
 xxxd1832xxx  therapy

we have found that  xxxd1832xxx  is particularly useful in debulking not only tumors, but also
thick plaques in patients who have psoriasiform

we have found that not all patients require
5 days of therapy, and that disease may return
after 3 weeks. thus, we have conducted a pilot
study using an alternate dosing schedule of
 xxxd1832xxx  administered as one 5-day
course of 18 µg/kg/day followed by weekly dosing thereafter for up to 24 weeks. this dosing
schedule has been effective in producing complete and durable remissions in a patient with
relapsed  xxxg2302xxx + anaplastic t-cell lymphoma and
ptcl unspecified [32]. this treatment regimen,
combined with local radiation, has produced a
year-long cr in a patient with gamma-/delta-panniculitic
t-cell lymphoma who had a positive pcr for
hepatitis c virus [33].

chemotherapy for his bowel disease, but the skin
remained involved over large surfaces and was
cleared in one course of  xxxd1832xxx  [31].

as the mechanism of action of  xxxd1832xxx  is distinct from traditional chemotherapy
and has exhibited minimal myelosuppression,
the safety, tolerability and efficacy of combining
 xxxd1832xxx  with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (chop)
chemotherapy is being evaluated as first-line
therapy in patients with aggressive ptcl.
 xxxd1832xxx  is dosed at 18 µg/kg/day on
days 1 and 2, followed by chop on day 3, with
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support
starting on day 4. in an interim analysis of
41 enrolled patients, among 31 who are
response-evaluable, the orr is 90%, with 71%
(22 out of 31) crs or unconfirmed crs and
19% (six out of 31) prs, and the median duration of response is 13 months. toxicities have
generally been grade 1/2 and transient, but five
patients discontinued treatment owing to
adverse events, all prior to the second cycle, and

non-hodgkin b-cell lymphoma

in the original phase i/ii trial, three nhl
patients responded: two with follicular
lymphomas, and a third having a primary
intermediate-grade b-cell nhl refractory to
chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. this
patient has remained in cr for over 3 years
after treatment with  xxxd1832xxx  [29].

optimizing  xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ®) therapy – drug

dang et al. conducted a phase ii trial in 45
patients with refractory nhl at the md
anderson cancer center [1,36]. in total, 32 out
of the 45 patients (71%) were refractory to
their last chemotherapy. patients received
 xxxd1832xxx  on the standard dosing protocol of every 3 weeks, 5-day courses and were
followed carefully for signs of vls. the orr
was 24.4%, with three crs (6.7%), eight prs
(17.8%) and nine patients with stable disease.
median time to treatment failure was 7 months
and progression-free survival at 20 months was
24% (95% ci: 0–60%). in this study, there
was no difference in the responses seen in
patients with high cd25+ staining (22%) and
low cd25 reactivity (29%).
kuzel et al. conducted a phase ii study in
29 patients with previously treated indolent
b-cell nhl (11  xxxg1175xxx + and 18  xxxg1175xxx -) [37]. the
histologic subtypes included eight patients with
small lymphocytic lymphoma (sll) and 21
patients with follicular grade i/ii lymphoma. all
patients had received prior therapy, with the
median number of prior treatments being three.
rituximab was administered to 76% of the
patients. among the 29 patients with response
information, the orr observed was pr 10%
(90% ci: 3–25%). the responders included two
patients whose tumors were  xxxg1175xxx - (11%
response rate) and one whose tumor was  xxxg1175xxx +
(9% response rate). of the eight patients with
sll, two responded (rr: 25%; 90% ci: 5–60%).
the sll responders included one with il-2rand one with  xxxg1175xxx + staining. the other
responder was a grade 1 follicle-center cell lymphoma whose lymphoma was  xxxg1175xxx -. in this
study, responses were seen in  xxxg1175xxx - as well as
 xxxg1175xxx + tumors. sll may represent a more
sensitive nhl to  xxxd1832xxx  therapy.
dang et al. conducted a phase ii trial combining  xxxd1832xxx  with rituximab for
relapsed/refractory b-cell nhl in 38 patients, of
whom 30 were rituximab refractory. the orr
was 32%, with six crs and six prs [38]. the
median time to progression for responders was
8 months (range: 2–36+ months); two patients
with rituximab-refractory follicular lymphoma
were in cr at 25 and over 36 months. the orr
was 55% (four crs, two prs) in 11 out of 14
patients with rituximab-refractory follicular lymphoma, and 100% in the three patients with rituximab-sensitive tumors. thus, the combination
of  xxxd1832xxx  plus rituximab was able to
produce durable responses in heavily pretreated
b-cell nhl.

systemic mastocytosis

treatment of patients with systemic mastocytosis
with  xxxd1832xxx  was not clinically effective
at the doses used [39].
graft-versus-host disease

targeting  xxxg1175xxx -expressing activated t lymphocytes is rationally an effective strategy for
acute graft rejection, as well as for treatment or
prevention of gvhd [29]. in a phase i study of
30 patients with steroid-refractory gvhd,
12 out of 24 had crs, and there was an orr
of 71% [40]. the maximal tolerated dose of
9 µg/kg/day on days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17 and 19 was
associated with a 46% cr rate, and elevated transaminase levels were dose limiting. a smaller study
enrolled 20 patients who received 4.5 µg/kg/day
on days 1–5 and then weekly on days 8, 15, 22
and 29. at day 36, there were nine out of 20 crs
(41%) and six patients maintained their response
by day 100, four of which were crs [41].  xxxd1832xxx  is thus effective in depleting cells
involved in gvhd. in the special case of
relapsed  xxxg2343xxx  following allogeneic stem cell
transplant for mf/ss,  xxxd1832xxx  is also
an effective therapy for managing the lymphoma
and chronic gvhd.
depletion of cd4+cd25+ regulatory t cells

mahnke et al. studied whether depletion of
cd4+cd25+ tregs in melanoma patients
increased their immune responses against their
tumors [42].  xxxd1832xxx  administered at
5 µg/kg/day bodyweight induced significant
reductions in tregs from peripheral blood, without affecting other cell populations. the reduction in tregs started immediately after the first
bolus of  xxxd1832xxx  and lasted for
13 days, with subsequent recovery thereafter.
successive treatments further reduced the number of circulating tregs. depletion of tregs was
permissive for contact dermatitis to a sensitizing
agent, dicalcium phosphate. vaccination with
tumor antigens following  xxxd1832xxx 
infusions was associated with the induction of
peptide-specific cd8+ t cells [42].
among the other alternative modalities that
can be used in humans to delete tregs is  xxxd1832xxx .  xxxd1832xxx  was shown to
reduce tregs and lead to an objective clinical
response in patients with ovarian cancer [43].
another study showed that tregs in the spleen,
peripheral blood and bone marrow of normal
c57bl/6 mice were variously reduced after a
single intraperitoneal injection of denileukin
465

drug evaluation – duvic & talpur

diftitox; the reduction was evident within 24 h
and lasted for approximately 10 days. injection
of  xxxd1832xxx  1 day before vaccination
enhanced antigen-specific t-cell responses to
above levels induced by vaccination alone [44].
autoimmune diseases

 xxxd1832xxx  was first examined in clinical
trials of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, with
promising results. in a pilot trial of ten patients
with stable plaque psoriasis with mean duration
of 10.9 years, four patients had striking improvement, four had moderate improvement and two
had minor responses after only two cycles [45].
the doses of  xxxd1832xxx  administered
were 100 or 200 ku/kg-1 (n = 5 for each dose),
compared with doses of 1000 ku/kg-1 given to
 xxxg2343xxx  patients in the pivotal trial [6], and were
similar to the doses used in gvhd subjects. in a
larger study, 41 patients with psoriasis were randomized to receive placebo or treatment with 5,
10 or 15 µg/kg daily of  xxxd1832xxx 
administered iv. for 3 consecutive days each week
for 4 consecutive weeks, and then observed for
1 month [46]. three out of 12 (25%) patients on
placebo compared with 12 out of 29 (41%)
patients treated with  xxxd1832xxx  improved
to the same degree.

the potential utility of  xxxd1832xxx  for
other autoimmune disorders has not been well
studied. in theory, autoimmune diseases, such as
systemic lupus, scleroderma and vasculitis, also
may be effective candidates for this targeted
ligand-fusion therapy [29]. tregs, which are
thought to be targeted by  xxxd1832xxx ,
are thought to dampen autoimmune reactions;
thus, more work is needed to understand the
optimal use of  xxxd1832xxx  therapy in
these diseases.
conclusion

 xxxd1832xxx  is a clinically effective and
novel targeted therapy that was approved for
 xxxg2343xxx . it has also demonstrated significant
activity in other t- and b-cell lymphoid malignancies, such as ptcl, cll and b-cell nhls.
it can be used in place of chemotherapy for
debulking tumors and in combination with
other agents. it may be active for a wide variety
of malignancies and autoimmune indications.
 xxxd1832xxx  is active regardless of low or
high expression of cd25; however, there may be
higher response rates in patients with higher
baseline staining. we expect that further studies
could expand the clinical spectrum for use of this
novel agent.

executive summary
background
•  xxxd1832xxx  is an engineered recombinant fusion protein composed of il-2 and the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin.
• the human  xxxg1175xxx  is present in three forms: low, intermediate and high affinity.
• while  xxxd1832xxx  binds to all three forms of the  xxxg1175xxx , only cells with intermediate- or high-affinity receptors
internalize it.
•  xxxd1832xxx  is approved for the treatment of patients with persistent or recurrent cutaneous t-cell lymphoma whose
malignant cells express the  xxxd924xxx  (cd25) component of the  xxxg1175xxx .
• treatment with  xxxd1832xxx  may cause capillary-leak syndrome and is associated with a group of acute hypersensitivity-type
events occurring during or within 24 h of study-drug infusion.
dosage & administration
•  xxxd1832xxx  is administered at 9–18 µg/kg/day intravenous infusion over at least 30–45 min every day for 5 consecutive
days, once every 21 days.
• alternative dosing schedules with reduced doses or once-weekly dosing have been used for other diseases.
factors that may predict superior response
• high cd25 expression of 20% or greater may predict superior response.
clinical efficacy
•  xxxd1832xxx  is us fda and european commission approved for the treatment of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma patients.
•  xxxd1832xxx  has been shown to induce a 30% objective response.
toxicity & tolerability
• toxicity is manageable with premedication; steroids allow better control over vascular-leak syndrome and increased
patient compliance.
conclusion
•  xxxd1832xxx  is active in t- and b-cell lymphoid malignancies, as well as other conditions mediated by activated t cells.

optimizing  xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ®) therapy – drug

future perspective

 xxxd1832xxx , approved for  xxxg2343xxx  in
1999, has also shown activity for other hematologic malignancies (recurrent and refractory cll
and b-cell nhl).
in patients with recurrent cll after therapy
with rituximab and  xxxd2120xxx , salvage regimens
with alemtuzumab or combination chemotherapies are often immunosuppressive and can
be associated with debilitating compromised-host
infections. frankel et al. showed that 12 out of 22
(54.5%) patients achieved reductions of peripheral cll cells [35]. this response rate in these
heavily pretreated patients is promising. dang
et al. showed that  xxxd1832xxx  has shown
activity in the phase i/ii non-hodgkin b-cell
lymphoma trial [36,38].
 xxxd1832xxx  may be useful for reducing tregs that block immune reactions to solid
tumors such as ovarian cancer and melanoma.
since  xxxd1832xxx  targets il-2-r-bearing
t cells, it has been used to treat gvhd and
autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis and
rheumatoid arthritis. ho et al. showed, in a
phase i study of 30 patients with steroid-refractory gvhd, that 12 out of 24 (50%) had crs
with an orr of 71% [40].  xxxd1832xxx

without affecting other cell populations [42].
in the future, with respect to  xxxg2343xxx , other
agents will be combined with  xxxd1832xxx  to increase patients’ response rates and to
prolong the duration of response following
therapy.  xxxd330xxx  can be administered to
