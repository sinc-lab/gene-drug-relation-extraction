salicylate-based anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the
early lesion of diabetic retinopathy
ling zheng,1 scott j. howell,2 denise a. hatala,2 kun huang,3 and timothy s. kern1,2

it has been previously reported that aspirin inhibited the
development of diabetic retinopathy in diabetic animals,
raising the possibility that anti-inflammatory drugs may
have beneficial effects on diabetic retinopathy. to further
explore this, we compared effects of oral consumption of
three different salicylate-based drugs (aspirin,  xxxd3219xxx , and  xxxd3255xxx ) on the development of early
stages of diabetic retinopathy in rats. these three drugs
differ in their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase but share an
ability to inhibit nuclear factor-␬b (nf-␬b). diabetes of
9 –10 months duration significantly increased the number
of tunel (transferase-mediated dutp nick-end labeling)positive capillary cells and acellular (degenerate) capillaries in the retinal vasculature, and all three salicylate-based
drugs inhibited this cell death and formation of acellular
capillaries without altering the severity of hyperglycemia.
in short-term diabetes (2– 4 months), all three salicylates
inhibited the diabetes-induced loss of neuronal cells from
the ganglion cell layer. oral aspirin (as a representative of
the salicylate family) inhibited diabetes-induced increase
in nf-␬b dna-binding affinity in electrophoretic mobility
shift assay and transcription factor array in nuclear extract isolated from whole retina. all three salicylates inhibited the diabetes-induced translocation of p50 (a
subunit of nf-␬b) into nuclei of retinal vascular endothelial cells of the isolated retinal vasculature, as well as of
p50 and p65 into nuclei of cells in the ganglion cell layer
and inner nuclear layer on whole-retinal sections.  xxxd3255xxx  (also as a representative of the salicylates)
inhibited the diabetes-induced upregulation of several inflammatory gene products, which are regulated by nf-␬b,
including vascular cell adhesion molecule, intracellular
adhesion molecule-1,  xxxg1578xxx , and
 xxxg1884xxx  in whole-retinal lysate. salicylates, in
doses administrated in our experiments, inhibited nf-␬b
and perhaps other transcription factors in the retina, were
well tolerated, and offered new tools to investigate and

egeneration of retinal capillaries is believed to
be an important contributor to the development
of clinically significant diabetic retinopathy. we
and others previously demonstrated that retinal
capillary cells die by an apoptotic-like process (1) in
diabetes and that the ability of a therapy to inhibit apoptosis in retinal microvascular cells predicts development of
the degenerate acellular capillaries in retinas of diabetic
animals (2).
an observation that aspirin consumption was associated
with a lower-than-expected severity of diabetic retinopathy in patients with arthritis led to a suggestion many years
ago that aspirin may be a potentially effective therapy
against diabetic retinopathy (3,4). inhibition of diabetesinduced degeneration of retinal capillaries in a 5-year
study of diabetic dogs given aspirin (5) confirmed this
effect, but prospective clinical trials yielded contradictory
conclusions (6,7). aspirin is a potent anti-inflammatory
agent that acts not only by inhibiting the enzymatic activity
of cyclooxygenases (coxs) by acetylation (8,9), but also
by inhibiting the activation of some transcription factors,
including nuclear factor-␬b (nf-␬b) (10) and ccaat
enhancer binding protein (c/ebp) (11).
nf-␬b is a transcription factor that plays an important
role in transcriptional regulation of inflammatory proteins. the nf-␬b complex consists of a number of
structurally related subunits (p50, p52, rela [also
known as p65], relb, and relc), which can form heterodimers or homodimers. the best characterized member of the nf-␬b-family is the p50/p65 heterodimer,
which consists of a p65 transactivation domain and a
p50 dna-binding domain.
increased nf-␬b dna-binding affinity has been detected both in the retinas of diabetic animals and in
retinal cells cultured in elevated levels of glucose (12–
16). prior studies (12,15) have suggested that nf-␬b
plays an important role in the development of diabetic
retinopathy via its ability to induce an inflammatory
condition. nf-␬b–regulated inflammatory gene products reported to be upregulated in retinas during diabetes by several (but not all) investigators include cox-2
(12,17,18),  xxxg1578xxx  (inos)
(17,19,20), adhesion molecules such as intracellular
adhesion molecule (icam)-1 (15,21,22), and proinflammatory cytokines such as  xxxg2296xxx -␣ (12)
and interleukin-1␤ (23–26). these changes likely contribute to diabetes-induced increases of prostaglandin

anti-inflammatory drug and diabetic retinopathy

e2 (17), nitrotyrosine (a marker of peroxynitrite) (20),
and leukostasis (15,21,22) in retinas.
to further explore the mechanism by which aspirin was
able to inhibit diabetic retinopathy in animals, we assessed
the ability of three different salicylates (aspirin, sodium
salicylate, and  xxxd3255xxx ) to inhibit diabetes-induced
degeneration of retinal capillaries in rats. all three drugs
can inhibit nf-␬b (27–30), but, unlike aspirin, neither
 xxxd3219xxx  nor  xxxd3255xxx  can directly inhibit
cox at therapeutic doses. others have speculated that
serum levels of salicylate measured in aspirin-fed rats (30
mg 䡠 [kg body wt 䡠 day]⫺1) were not sufficient to inhibit
nf-␬b (31). the aims of this study were to compare
salicylates with respect to their abilities to inhibit diabetes-induced 1) degeneration of retinal capillaries and
neurons, 2) nf-␬b activation in retinal cells, and 3)
expression of inflammatory markers in retinas.
research design and methods
 xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic rats. diabetes was induced in fasted male
rats (lewis) with  xxxd3249xxx  (60 mg/kg body wt), and animals were housed
in ventilated microisolator cages. all experiments followed the guidelines set
forth by the association for research in vision and ophthalmology resolution
on treatment of animals in research. diabetic rats were treated with insulin
(0 –3 units) as needed to maintain body weight while still allowing chronic
hyperglycemia. this amount of insulin was adjusted as necessary to keep the
same glycemia level among diabetic groups. the extent of blood glucose
elevation was estimated every 2–3 months by measuring glycated hemoglobin
level and by measuring blood glucose concentration as previously described
(2,15). one week after the injection of  xxxd3249xxx , diabetic rats were
randomly assigned to receive commercially available  xxxd234xxx  (pills
were crushed into powder using an electrical blender),  xxxd3219xxx 
(sigma, st. louis, mo), or  xxxd3255xxx  (sigma) or to remain as diabetic
controls. aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  were given in powered food, and
 xxxd3255xxx  was given in drinking water. rats were killed at two durations of
diabetes: 2– 4 months after the onset of diabetes (to determine what biochemical effects salicylates had) and after 9 –10 months of diabetes (to determine
the effects of salicylates on retinal histopathology). actual consumption of
aspirin,  xxxd3219xxx , and  xxxd3255xxx  during the long-term experiment
amounted to 26.6 ⫾ 1.5, 26.9 ⫾ 2.5, and 102.5 ⫾ 10.1 mg 䡠 (kg body wt 䡠 day)⫺1,
respectively. water was changed and measured every other day. food was
changed and measured weekly. for long-term (9 –10 months) studies, diabetic
rats in one experiment (purchased at the same time) were randomly assigned
into three diabetic groups (control, treated with aspirin, or treated with
 xxxd3219xxx ), while for another experiment (purchased at a different
time), diabetic rats were randomized into control and  xxxd3255xxx  treatment
groups. age-matched nondiabetic rats were set up each time as normal
controls. the doses of aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  were chosen according to
the dose of aspirin previously reported by us, which has beneficial effects on
diabetic retinopathy (5), while the dose of  xxxd3255xxx  was selected based on
the dose used in studies of inflammation (32,33).
isolation of retinal vasculature. retinal vasculature was isolated as
previously described by us (2,15). the isolated vasculature was mounted on
slides and used for p50 and p65 immunostaining, transferase-mediated dutp
nick-end labeling (tunel) assay, and acellular capillary quantitation.
nuclear extract and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. nuclear proteins from retinas were isolated as described by others (34) with some
modifications. all steps were carried out on ice or at 4°c. freshly isolated
retinas were rinsed in pbs buffer and spun at 1,500g for 5 min. buffer a (10
mmol/l hepes, ph 7.9, 1.5 mmol/l mgcl2, 10 mmol/l kcl, 0.5 mmol/l dithiothreitol [dtt], and 0.5 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [pmsf]) was
added to the tissue (2.5 ml/g wet weight). five strokes on a hand-held tissue
grind tube were used to homogenize tissue. after the addition of np-40 (0.5%),
five additional strokes were performed. the suspension was incubated for 10
min to lyse the cells with detergent, and the homogenate was centrifuged for
10 min at 2,000g. the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in cold buffer b (25%
glycerol, 20 mmol/l hepes, ph 7.9, 1.5 mmol/l mgcl2, 0.42 mol/l nacl, 0.2
mmol/l edta, 0.5 mmol/l dtt, 0.5 mmol/l pmsf, and 10 ␮g/ml pepstain,
leupeptin, and aprotinin) and shaken at 4°c for 30 min for high-salt extraction.
the lysed nuclei were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000g. the supernatants
were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, buffer d (20% glycerol, 20 mmol/l
hepes, ph 7.9, 0.1 mmol/l kcl, 0.2 mmol/l edta, 0.5 mmol/l dtt, 0.5 mmol/l
pmsf, and 10 ␮g/ml pepstain, leupeptin, and aprotinin) was added at a ratio
338

of 1:1 (vol:vol), and the supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000g.
the amount of nuclear protein in the supernatant was determined by protein
assay (bio-rad, hercules, ca) and stored at ⫺80°c until use. nuclear proteins
(5 ␮g) were incubated with a 32p-labeled double-strand nf-␬b consensus
sequence (promega, madison, wi), and the electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (emsa) was performed according to instructions provided by the
manufacturer. dna protein complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing
polyacrylamide gel, and the bands were examined by autoradiography. the
specificity of binding was examined by competition with a 50-fold nonlabeled
nf-␬b or ap-1 consensus sequence (promega), preincubated with nuclear
proteins and labeled nf-␬b oligouncleotide. a supershift assay was also
performed to determine the specificity of nf-␬b binding to its specific
consensus sequence by using anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies (santa cruz
biotechnology, santa cruz, ca).
transcription factor array. two array systems were purchased from
panomics (fremont, ca). array i includes oligouncleotides known to bind to
c/ebp (35) and the classic p50/p65 heterodimer of nf-␬b (36), while array v
includes a oligonucleotide known to bind to the p65/p65 homodimer (37) of
nf-␬b. array v also includes a oligonucleotide that has been shown bind to
p50/p75 heterodimers better than p50/p65 heterodimers (38). (p75 is a
p65-related protein.) array i was performed first with one sample from each
experimental group and another time with three different (pooled) samples
from each group. both experiments yielded similar results. array v was
performed once with pooled samples. results shown here are of the pooled
samples.
nuclear extract from retina was isolated as above. for pooled samples,
biotin-labeled dna-binding oligonucleotides were incubated with 9 ␮g nuclear extract (3 ␮g nuclear extract from three different rats in one group) for
30 min to allow the formation of protein/dna complexes. the protein/dna
complexes were then separated from the free probes on the spin columns
provided by the manufacturer and hybridized to the transignal array membrane overnight at 42°c. hybridized membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase–labeled streptavidin. signals were detected, and resulting
images were analyzed using metamorph imaging software (universal imaging,
downington, pa). background values were generated by obtaining intensity
values from blank areas on each blot. these background intensity values were
averaged, and the resulting average background was adjusted to correspond
to each samples’ given area and then subtracted from each sample. the
resulting values are displayed as total intensity, which represents the collective values for each pixel in a given samples’ area. a housekeeping gene
( xxxg2251xxx  for array i and nf-1/l for array v) was used, and the values of nf-␬b
and c/ebp on the arrays were normalized to it. spots that increased or
decreased by at least twofold were considered significant.
immunohistochemical detection of nf-␬b subunits (p50 and p65)
retinal blood vessels. retinal vessels were isolated by the trypsin digest
method. p50 was stained as previously described (15). three different p65
antibodies (p65 [mab3026], chemicon international, temecula, ca; p65
[sc-109], santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca; p65 [rb-9034], lab vision,
fremont, ca) were also applied to the retinal blood vessels in order to study
the nuclear translocation of p65. four different fields containing ⬃750 – 850
capillary cells (endothelial cells and pericytes) of each sample were evaluated
in a masked manner. the capillary endothelial cells (elongated nuclear shape)
or pericytes (round nuclei on outside of vessel wall) having positive immunostaining in nuclei were quantified separately.
retinal sections. formalin-fixed paraffin sections (5 ␮m) were immunostained with the p50 (santa cruz biotechnology) and p65 (lab vision)
antibodies applied at a dilution of 1:500 overnight at 4°c.
tunel assay
the retinal vasculature from rats 9 –10 months post-onset of diabetes was
isolated by the trypsin digest method. tunel reaction (in situ cell death
detection kit, fluorescein; roche, mannheim, germany) was performed as
previously described (15). the number of tunel-positive nuclei in retinal
capillaries of different groups was counted in the entire retinal vasculature
and reported relative to that in nondiabetic controls.
quantitation of acellular capillaries
after quantifying tunel-positive cells, the coverslips were gently soaked
from the slides. retinal vessels were then stained with periodic acid—schiff
and hematoxylin. acellular capillaries were quantified in five to seven field
areas in the mid-retina (200⫻ magnification) in a masked manner. acellular
capillaries were identified as capillary-sized vessel tubes having no nuclei
anywhere along their length and were reported per square millimeter of retinal
area.
ganglion cell count and retinal thickness measurement in whole-retina
sections. formalin-fixed paraffin retinal sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for light microscopy and morphometry of retinal thickness. to
control the sectioning angle, all eyes were cut through the pupil and optic
nerve area, thus insuring that sections were essentially tangential through the

retina. pictures were taken at four locations in the retina (both sides of the
optic nerve [posterior] and mid-retina [central]) at 400⫻ magnification. the
nuclei in the ganglion cell layer (gcl) (not including nuclei of blood vessels
in that layer) were counted, and the thicknesses of retinal layers were
measured using a image-pro plus software as follows: gcl, inner plexiform
layer, inner nuclear layer (inl), outer plexiform layer, and outer nuclear layer.
serum salicylate measurement. blood was withdrawn from anesthetized
rats (not fasted)  xxxd1891xxx :00 –11:00 a.m. sample preparation and reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis were performed as
previously described (39,40) with modifications. briefly, 200 ␮l methanol
(hplc grade; fisher scientific, fair lawn, nj) was added to 100 ␮l serum.
samples were then vigorously vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 15,000g
for 25 min to precipitate proteins. next, 250 ␮l supernatant was speed-vac
dried at ⫺40°c, redissolved in water, and then injected into an analytical
reverse-phase hplc (c8 column; vydac, hesperia, ca). samples were eluted
with an isocratic gradient (20% methanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 35
min and monitored by an ultraviolet detector at 310 nm. salicylate constantly
eluted at ⬃25 min. serum salicytate concentrations were calculated by
integrating the peak areas of salicyate and then normalized to a hplc
standard curve prepared with  xxxd3159xxx  standard (sigma).
western blot analysis. rat retinas were isolated and sonicated in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer as previously described (15). total amount of
protein was determined by the bio-rad protein assay. samples (50 ␮g) were
fractionated by sds-page and electroblotted onto nitrocellucose membrane,
and the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk. antibodies for icam-1
(santa cruz biotechnology, 1:200 dilution), vascular cell adhesion molecule
(vcam) (santa cruz biotechnology, 1:500 dilution), inos (sigma, 1:1,000
dilution), and cox-2 (cayman chemical, 1:1,000 dilution) were applied
overnight at 4°c. membranes then were stripped and reprobed with ␤-actin
(sigma) to confirm equal protein loading. the films were subsequently
scanned, and band intensity was quantified using quantity one 1-d analysis
software (bio-rad).
statistical analysis. all results are expressed as means ⫾ sd. the data were
analyzed by kruskal-wallis, followed by the mann-whitney test. differences
were considered statistically significant with p values ⬍0.05.

results

salicylates did not alter glycemia in diabetic animals.
because the severity of hyperglycemia greatly influences
the development of diabetic retinopathy, considerable
effort was devoted to maintaining glycemia comparable in
the experimental and the control diabetic groups. after
9 –10 months’ onset of diabetes (table 1), ghb values in
diabetic rats treated with the three salicylates were not
significantly different from those of control diabetic rats,
and all were significantly higher than corresponding values
in nondiabetic rats. likewise, blood glucose values for
diabetic rats and diabetic rats treated with all three
salicylates remained significantly higher than values in
nondiabetic rats. body weights of diabetic rats with different treatments were significantly less than those of nondiabetic rats but were not different among diabetic groups.
ghb value, blood glucose, and body weight were also
measured in the shorter duration study and showed similar results. administration of the three salicylates did not
adversely effect the health or life span of diabetic rats.
diabetes, vol. 56, february 2007

serum was collected  xxxd1891xxx :00 –11:00 a.m. (4 –5 h after
lights were turned on). serum salicylate levels of aspirin-,
 xxxd3219xxx –, and  xxxd3255xxx -treated rats were
0.037 ⫾ 0.023, 0.113 ⫾ 0.05, and 0.002 ⫾ 0.002 mmol/l,
respectively. the very low serum salicylate concentration
of  xxxd3255xxx -treated rats may be due to poor absorption
of  xxxd3255xxx  and a shorter half-life of its active metabolite (41).
aspirin altered the dna-binding affinity of nf-␬b in
retinas. the ability of aspirin to inhibit nf-␬b activation
was assessed by emsa using nuclear extract that was
isolated from whole retinas. after 2 months of diabetes,
there was increased dna-binding activity of nf-␬b in
retinas of diabetic rats compared with nondiabetic rats,
and aspirin treatment inhibited this diabetes-induced increase in dna-binding activity (fig. 1a). quantitative data
of nf-␬b dna-binding affinity is summarized in fig. 1b.
supershift assay (fig. 1c) revealed two protein-dna complexes with different molecular mass, both of which contained p65 and p50. these two complexes might contain
p50 and p65 in different stoichiometric ratios and/or with
additional factors such as c/ebp␤ or bcl-3 as suggested by
naschberger et al. (42).
transcription factor arrays were also used to evaluate
the dna-binding affinity of nf-␬b and c/ebp using nuclear extract isolated from whole retinas. in the arrays,
diabetes increased nf-␬b dna-binding affinity of the
p50/p65 heterodimer by 2.2-fold compared with normal
rats, and this diabetes-induced increase in p50/p65-binding
affinity was blocked by aspirin treatment (fig. 1d). moreover, p65/p65 dna-binding affinity was greatly enhanced
in retinas of diabetic rats compared with undetectable
levels in normal and aspirin-treated diabetic rats (fig. 1e).
dna-binding affinity of the p50/p65 and p50/p75 heterodimers showed no significant differences among retinas of normal rats, diabetic rats, or diabetic rats treated
with aspirin (fig. 1f). aspirin did inhibit c/ebp dnabinding affinity in retinas, but diabetes did not increase
c/ebp dna-binding affinity compared with that in nondiabetic rats (fig. 1g).
aspirin,  xxxd3219xxx , or  xxxd3255xxx  inhibited
diabetes-induced translocation of nf-␬b to the nucleus in retinal cells. since emsa and transcription
factor array data showed that the oral administration of
aspirin to diabetic rats resulted in dna-binding affinity
changes for nf-␬b (p50/p65 and p65/p65), we acertained
the nuclear location of the nf-␬b subunits (p50 and p65)
via immunohistochemistry on retinal sections and on
isolated retinal blood vessels. whereas inactivated nf-␬b
is retained in cytoplasm by binding to inhibitory proteins,
activated p50 and p65 are located in nuclei. increased
numbers of p50- and p65-stained nuclei were observed in

gcl and inl of retinas of diabetic rats, and administration
of the three salicylates to the diabetic rats inhibited this
diabetes-induced increase of p50 and p65 nuclear staining
(fig. 2a and b).
we also investigated the localization of p50 and p65 on
the isolated retinal vasculature. p50 immunostained endothelial nuclei were found in retinas of both nondiabetic
and diabetic rats, but diabetes caused a fourfold increase
in the numbers of endothelial nuclei immunostained by
p50 antibody compared with the nondiabetic control (p ⬍
0.01). administration of the three salicylates all significantly inhibited the diabetes-induced increase in the number of p50-immunostained endothelial nuclei (p ⬍ 0.05;
fig. 2c). likewise, diabetes increased p50 nuclear localization in pericytes, and the p50 nuclear localization was
significantly inhibited by  xxxd3255xxx  (p ⬍ 0.05) and
partially inhibited by aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  (data
not shown).
in contrast to the p50 subunit, no p65 immunostaining in
either endothelial or pericyte nuclei was observed from
isolated retinal vasculatures of diabetic and control rats.
however, diabetes appeared to induce an increase in p65
staining in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells (data not
shown).

aspirin,  xxxd3219xxx , or  xxxd3255xxx  prevented diabetes-induced retinal ganglion cell loss.
neuron death has been reported in the retinas of diabetic
rats (43). when compared with nondiabetic rats, a 4-month
duration of diabetes caused a significant loss of cells in the
gcl (7.5 ⫾ 0.9 vs. 9.3 ⫾ 1.3 cells/100 ␮m length of retina;
p ⬍ 0.05) and reduction in retinal thickness (140.7 ⫾ 15.2
vs. 162.7 ⫾ 16.8 ␮m; p ⬍ 0.05) (table 2). administration of
the three salicylates inhibited diabetes-induced cell loss in
the gcl but did not prevent the reduction in retinal
thickness caused by diabetes.
aspirin,  xxxd3219xxx , or  xxxd3255xxx  prevented diabetes-induced retinal capillary degeneration. acellular, degenerate, and nonperfused retinal
capillaries are believed to be one of the most important
early lesions of diabetic retinopathy, and evidence suggests that apoptotic vascular cell death contributes to the
formation of acellular capillaries. we used the tunel
assay to detect dna damage and apoptosis in vascular
cells (endothelial cells and pericytes) on the trypsindigested retinal vasculature. using the same samples, we
also quantified acellular capillaries.
there was a 3.7-fold increase in the number of
tunel-positive capillary cells (endothelial cells and

 xxxd3255xxx  inhibited diabetes-induced overexpression of inflammatory markers in the diabetic retinas.
to further explore how salicylates exert their beneficial
effects on the retinal vasculature in diabetes, we used
 xxxd3255xxx  as a representative salicylate. after demonstrating that  xxxd3255xxx  inhibited nf-␬b (p50 and p65
subunits) translocation, we investigated whether it could
inhibit gene products that are regulated by nf-␬b activation. inflammatory enzymes such as inos and cox-2 are
regulated by nf-␬b and play roles in the inflammatory
process. icam-1 and vcam also are regulated by nf-␬b
and play a critical role in the adherence of leukocytes to
the vessel wall. diabetes increased expression of inos,

retinopathy) and prevent ganglion cell loss in diabetic rats.
we postulate that the salicylate-mediated inhibition of
early stages of diabetic retinopathy is due at least in part to
inhibition of the diabetes-induced activation of nf-␬b and
other transcription factors in the retina. activation of
nf-␬b has been implicated in the death of cultured retinal
endothelial cells and pericytes in high glucose, and specific nf-␬b inhibitors tested were able to inhibit the cell
death under those circumstances (15,16).
the mechanism of this action of salicylates is of considerable interest. aspirin effects vary with different doses
(44): 80 mg/day has been regarded as a low dose in humans
(⬃1.1 mg 䡠 [kg body wt 䡠 day]⫺1 based on average human
body weight of 70 kg), 2– 4 g/day (⬃28 –56 mg 䡠 [kg body wt
䡠 day]⫺1) as intermediate doses, and 6 – 8 g/day (⬃86 –114

mg 䡠 [kg body wt 䡠 day]⫺1) as high doses. aspirin can
irreversibly acetylate serine groups on cox-1 to inhibit
platelet thromboxane a2 generation at a low dose, globally
inhibit cox-1 and -2 and block prostaglandin production
at intermediate doses, and has unknown mechanism(s) at
high doses (44). the dose of aspirin (27 mg 䡠 [kg body wt
䡠 day]⫺1) that we gave the diabetic rats was on the low side
of the intermediate range, which should inhibit coxs and
prostaglandin production.  xxxd3219xxx , however, is
inactive against coxs in purified enzyme preparations
(45), arguing against the idea that the inhibition of retinopathy by salicylates observed by us was secondary to
inhibition of coxs. moreover, it was recently reported that
clopidogrel, an inhibitor of adp-induced platelet aggregation, did not inhibit development of acellular capillaries in
retinas of diabetic rats, whereas retinopathy was inhibited
by low-intermediate doses of aspirin similar to ours (30 mg
䡠 [kg body wt 䡠 day]⫺1) (31).
another known effect of salicylates is their ability to
inhibit activation of some transcription factors, including
nf-␬b. millimolar concentrations of salicylate are commonly used to inhibit the activation of nf-␬b (10,28,29,46),
probably mediated predominantly through effects on activities of cellular kinases such as i␬b kinase ␤ (30,47). in
the present study, aspirin at doses of 27 mg 䡠 (kg body wt
䡠 day)⫺1 gave morning serum salicylate concentrations of
only ⬃0.037 ⫾ 0.023 mmol/l at this time of the day (similar
to that reported by sun et al. [31]). despite low blood
level of salicylates, however, multiple independent tests
(emsa, transcription factor array, and immunostaining for
nuclear p50 and p65) all suggest that the dose of salicylates used by us did indeed result in inhibition of nf-␬b
nuclear translocation and dna binding in the retina.
joussen et al. (12) demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that a somewhat higher dose of aspirin
(50 mg 䡠 kg [body wt 䡠 day]⫺1) likewise inhibited nf-␬b
diabetes, vol. 56, february 2007

activation in retinas of diabetic rats. whether the inhibition of nf-␬b activation in our studies occurs via direct or
indirect effects remains to be determined. blood levels of
salicylate might have been considerably higher soon after
consuming the drug, thereby inhibiting nf-␬b during
periods of high drug levels.
as reported by us before (15) and repeated in this study,
diabetes results in increased translocation of the nf-␬b
subunit p50 into nuclei of endothelial cells in retinas of
diabetic animals. neither we nor romeo et al. (16) found
evidence of nuclear location of p65 into retinal endothelial
cells in diabetes. in contrast, diabetes increased nuclear
translocation of both p50 and p65 and was detected in
cells of the inl and gcl. all three salicylates inhibited the
diabetes-induced translocation of p50 into nuclei of retinal
endothelial nuclei and of p50 and p65 into nuclei in the inl
and gcl. thus, diabetes-induced capillary degeneration is
at least closely associated with nf-␬b activation in both
vascular and neural compartments of retina. it is wellknown that p65 is the subunit of nf-␬b, which has
transcriptional activity, but some recent studies show that
p50/p50 homodimers can also be involved in transcription
of genes, including  xxxg2049xxx  (48), p53 (49), and bax (50).
p50 does not bind solely to nf-␬b subunits and can also
synergistically act with c/ebp␤ and bcl-3 to regulate gene
transcription (51,52).
besides inhibition of nf-␬b, aspirin can also inhibit
other transcription factors, such as ap-1 and c/ebp
(10,11). sun et al. (31) reported that c/ebp␤ expression
was increased in retinas of diabetic rats, and they speculated that inhibition of retinopathy by aspirin might be
mediated via effects on c/ebp␤. c/ebp␤ is also of interest
because it regulates expression of at least some proinflammatory proteins including cox-2 (53). further study is
needed, but our studies indicate that at 2 months’ duration
of diabetes, the c/ebp dna-binding affinity did not signif343

anti-inflammatory drug and diabetic retinopathy

icantly change between nondiabetic and diabetic rats,
whereas aspirin did inhibit this binding affinity. multiple
members of the c/ebp family exist; however, whether the
binding affinity of some of these members changes in
diabetes is not yet clear. even if c/ebp␤ activity is
increased in diabetes, several recent studies have reported
that p50 regulates its transcriptional activity, especially of
c/ebp␤ (54,55), thus potentially linking our findings with
p50 with those of c/ebp␤ reported by sun et al. (31).
inhibition of nf-␬b activation by salicylates was further
suggested by downregulation of cox-2, inos, icam-1, and
vcam in whole-retinal lysate. the transcription of these
proinflammatory molecules is regulated by nf-␬b, as well
as other transcription factors. most of these inflammatory
proteins have been reported to be expressed in vascular
and nonvascular cells of the retina (17,19,31,56,57), and
the possible contribution of each of these cell types to the
neurodegeneration and vascular degeneration in diabetic
retinopathy remains to be clarified. increasing evidence
suggests that inflammation plays a critical role in the
development of diabetic retinopathy, and present findings
are consistent with this postulate. further studies will be
needed to assess whether the salicylates can inhibit other
parameters of inflammation, including vascular permeability and inflammatory cell infiltration, and whether the
beneficial effects of salicylates are selectively mediated on
vascular cells, neuroglial cells, or both.
the evidence presented in this study shows that several
salicylates can inhibit the diabetes-mediated degeneration
of retinal capillaries in diabetic rats and raises a possibility
that these therapies may inhibit capillary and neuron
degeneration in patients if given in high-enough concentrations. prior clinical studies using low doses of aspirin
(9.3 mg 䡠 [kg body wt 䡠 day]⫺1 in the early treatment
diabetic retinopathy study [7] or 14.1 mg 䡠 [kg body wt 䡠
day]⫺1 in the damad study [6]) sufficient only to inhibit
platelet and thromboxane production failed (7) or
achieved only modest inhibition (6) of diabetic retinopathy. these clinical studies differed from our present and
previous animal study (5) in several ways: 1) per kilogram
body weight, our animals received higher doses of salicylates than given to the patients; 2) our animals were
treated from the onset of diabetes, whereas patients
already had mild (6) to advanced nonproliferative retinopathy (7) at the start of the clinical studies; 3) the duration
of these clinical trails was undesirably short, considering
what is now known about needed study durations for
retinopathy; and 4) clinically available methods to assess
the retinal vasculature (fundus photos or even fluorescein
angiography) are not able to monitor the early stages of
capillary degeneration with the sensitivity achieved by us
using microscopic assessment of the isolated retinal vasculature. thus, the clinical reports of failure or only
modest benefit of salicylates to inhibit retinopathy to date
have not definitively answered the potential efficacy of
salicylates as a therapy against diabetic retinopathy.
we interpret the available evidence as indicating that
the salicylate-mediated inhibition of capillary and neuron
degeneration in retinas of diabetic animals is mediated at
least in part via inhibition of nf-␬b and the subsequent
inflammatory response. further testing of this hypothesis
will require more selective inhibition or elimination of
proinflammatory molecules and selective inhibition of
activation of transcription factors. salicylates nevertheless
seem able to safely inhibit the degeneration of retinal
capillaries and neurons in diabetes and, thus, can be
344

expected to provide further insight into the pathogenesis
of diabetic retinopathy and offer a basis for development
of even better therapies.
