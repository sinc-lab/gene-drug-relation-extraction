pharmacological properties of lorglumide as a member of a new class of cholecystokinin antagonists.  derivatives of 5-(dipentylamino)-5-oxo-pentanoic acid are a new class of non-peptide cholecystokinin (cck) antagonists. the most potent compound, d,l-4-(3,4-dichlorobenzoylamino)-5-(dipentylamino)-5-oxo-pen tanoic acid (lorglumide, cr 1409), has a great affinity for the pancreatic cck receptors and is a competitive, specific and potent cck antagonist on the smooth muscles of the gall bladder and ileum of the guinea pig and on the cck-induced amylase secretion of isolated pancreatic acini. in vivo lorglumide antagonizes the contraction of the gall bladder of the guinea pig and of the dog provoked by i.v. cck-8 or  xxxd464xxx  ( xxxd464xxx ). it antagonizes the satiety effect of cck-8 in the rat and is protective against  xxxd464xxx -,  xxxd3296xxx - and diet-induced pancreatitis. lorglumide is therefore a useful pharmacological tool to study the functions of cck. for its pharmacological properties, its relatively low toxicity and because it is active also after oral administration, lorglumide is a candidate for diagnostic or therapeutic use in man when an involvement of cck is suspected.
