abstract. a radioligand binding assay for the herg (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) k+
channel was developed to identify compounds which may have inhibitory activity and potential
cardiotoxicity. pharmacological characterization of the [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding assay for herg
k+ channels was performed using herg-expressing hek293 cells. the assay conditions
employed yielded 90% specific binding using 10 mg / well of membrane protein with 1.5 nm of
[3h] xxxd236xxx  at 25°c. the kd and bmax values were 5.91 ± 0.81 nm and 6.36 ± 0.26 pmol / mg,
respectively. the intraassay and interassay variations were 11.4% and 14.9%, respectively.
binding affinities for 32 reference compounds (including dofetilide,  xxxd1708xxx , and terfenadine)
with diverse structures demonstrated a similar potency rank order for herg inhibition to that
reported in the literature. moreover, the [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding data demonstrated a rank order
of affinity that was highly correlated to that of inhibitory potency in the electrophysiological
studies for herg in hek293 (rsp = 0.91, p<0.05). in conclusion, the [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding
assay is rapid and capable of detecting herg inhibitors.

cause of life-threatening torsade de pointes, a form of
polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia, in susceptible
individuals (3, 6). syncope and sudden death due to
torsade de pointes caused by noncardiovascular drugs
such as terfenadine (antihistamine),  xxxd236xxx  (antihistamine), and  xxxd1708xxx  (gastrokinetic) led to their
withdrawal from the market (7, 8). consequently,
cardiac safety relating to ikr k+ channels has become a
major concern of regulatory agencies, as herg channel
inhibition has been identified as the firmest link to qt
prolongation. in order to prevent costly attrition, it
has become a high priority in drug discovery to screen
out inhibitory activity on herg channels in lead
compounds as early as possible. electrophysiological
study using the patch clamp technique in herg-transfected mammalian cells generates the most definitive
data on herg inhibition. however, the assay is slow
and costly. other functional assays using rb flux or
voltage-sensitive dyes have relatively low sensitivity,
limiting their usefulness as efficient drug screens (9, 10).

introduction
the rapidly activating delayed rectifier k+ currents
(ikr) critically contribute to cardiac repolarization (1).
the human ether-a-go-go-related gene, herg, which
is expressed in the heart of mammalian species including
humans, encodes the pore-forming  xxxg220xxx  for ikr
(2). heterologously expressed herg currents in
mammalian cells including hek293 and cho cells
are known to share pharmacological and biophysical
properties with ikr. mutations in herg are characterized by delayed ventricular repolarization, manifested
on the electrocardiogram as a prolongation of qt
interval (congenital long qt syndrome: lqts) (3 – 5).
a plethora of drugs including methanesulfonanilides
(e.g., dofetilide, mk-499, and e-4031) are known to
cause qt prolongation by blocking ikr k+ channels
(acquired long qt syndrome), which is the underlying

given the fact that drug-induced blockade of ikr is the
primary cause of life-threatening arrhythmias, a
[3h] xxxd236xxx  binding assay in the herg transfected
embryonic kidney cell line hek293 (11) was developed
in order to provide a rapid and low-cost screen for
herg-binding activity.  xxxd236xxx  is known to be a
potent blocker of herg channels (7, 12). the assay
was validated with 32 known herg channel blockers
with diverse structures. furthermore, the radioligand
binding data were compared with results from patch
clamp studies.

(wellesley, ma, usa). human embryonic kidney
(hek293) cells stably expressing the  xxxg1246xxx 
were licensed from the university of wisconsin alumni
research foundation (madison, wi, usa) (11).
membrane preparation
cell cultures of herg transfected hek293 cells
were maintained in 90% minimum essential medium,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm lglutamine, and non-essential amino acids in a humidified incubator, 37°c, 5% co2. membranes were prepared from cell cultures following the method of
finlayson et al. (13) for small scale preparations or by
modified methods for large scale production.
small scale preparations employed cell monolayers,

which were washed with hank’s  xxxd2988xxx 
(hbss), then harvested by detachment with trypsin
/ edta, edta alone, or scraping into 0.32 m sucrose
containing protease inhibitors (4 mg / ml aprotinin,
1 m g/ ml leupeptin, 100 mm 4-(2-amino-ethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hcl [ xxxd502xxx ® sc,  xxxd502xxx ], and
1 m g / ml pepstatin a). scraped cells remained in
sucrose, while the others were centrifuged, resuspended
in hbss to wash them, centrifuged, and resuspended
in 0.32 m sucrose and protease inhibitors. cells were
homogenized using a glass / teflon tissue grinder. the
suspension was centrifuged 10 min 650 ´ g, 4°c and
the supernatant was retained on ice during pellet
resuspension in high purity h2o, 0°c. following 10-min
incubation, the pellet suspension was homogenized
and centrifuged as above. the two supernatants were
combined and centrifuged for 15 min at 48,000 ´ g, 4°c.
pelleted membranes were resuspended and homogenized as before in membrane buffer (10 mm hepes,
ph 7.4, 5 mm kcl, 130 mm nacl). alternatively,
large scale preparations employed cells grown in cell
factories (nunc, rochester, ny, usa). cells were
rinsed with hbss, detached with edta, washed, and
resuspended in membrane buffer containing protease
inhibitors. the cell suspension was disrupted using a
polytron tissue grinder (kinematica, lucerne, switzerland) and centrifuged for 10 min at 700 ´ g. the supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 48,000 ´ g, 4°c.
pelleted membranes were resuspended and homogenized using a glass / teflon tissue grinder in membrane
buffer. membrane protein was assessed by the bca
method (pierce biotechnology, inc., rockford, il,
usa), and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80°c. freshly thawed membranes were
employed in all assays.
[3h] xxxd236xxx  binding assay
[3h] xxxd236xxx  binding in herg transfected hek293
cell membranes was assessed by modification of
previous methods developed for  xxxg1246xxx 
binding (13 – 15). all binding assays were performed
in a total volume of 100 ml: 60 m l of buffer (10 mm
hepes, ph 7.4, 130 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 0.8 mm
mgcl2, 1 mm naegta, 10 mm glucose, 0.1% bsa)
and membrane suspension, 20 m l of test drug or vehicle,
and 20 m l of [3h] xxxd236xxx . non-specific binding
(nsb) was defined by 10 m m  xxxd236xxx . incubation
was conducted in 96-well polypropylene plates (costar)
at 25°c with equilibrium attainment experimentally
verified at 60 min. binding was terminated by rapid
filtration onto gf / b glass fiber filtermats, presoaked in
0.3% polyethyleneimine, followed by rapid washing 6
times (2 ml) with ice-cold solution containing 25 mm

tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 130 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 0.8 mm
mgcl2, 0.05 mm cacl2, and 0.1% bsa using a tomtec
mach 2 harvester. captured radiolabel was detected
using a wallac lkb 1205 betaplate liquid scintillation
counter. for optimization of herg protein concentration in the assay, tissue linearity experiments with 0 to
40 m g/ well of membrane protein and [3h]astemzole in
the final concentration of 1.5 nm were conducted to
demonstrate that under the conditions employed, radioligand was present in excess of the receptors. tissue
linearity experiments also were performed under the
assay conditions described above with wild type
hek293 cell membranes (perkinelmer life sciences).
for saturation binding studies, 10 mg/ well of herg
membrane protein was incubated with [3h]astemzole
diluted in assay buffer to concentrations of 0 to 30 nm,
thus extending the concentration range 10-fold above
the expected kd. all final [3h] xxxd236xxx  concentrations
were calculated from total ligand cpm. for dmso
tolerance studies, the binding activity of 10 m g / well of
herg membrane protein and 1.5 nm [3h] xxxd236xxx 
was evaluated in the presence of 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%,
5%, and 10% dmso. for competitive binding studies,
assays were performed in the volumes mentioned above
with [3h] xxxd236xxx  in final concentrations of 1.4 to
1.8 nm and 10 m g / well of herg membrane protein.
all test compounds were solubilized and serially diluted
in 100% dmso prior to dilution in assay buffer. seven
to 12 concentrations in the appropriate range for each
competitor were tested. radioligand concentration was
approximately one fourth the experimental kd and
provided at least a 10-fold excess over bound ligand
with 10 m g membrane protein. mean data and associated
standard errors of the mean were calculated using
microsoft excel.
electrophysiological studies
hek293 cells (11) were maintained in minimum
essential medium with earle’s salts supplemented with
nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, penicillin,
streptomycin,  xxxd2191xxx ® and fetal bovine serum. the
internal (composition: 130 mm kcl, 5 mm mgcl2,
10 mm hepes, 5 mm egta, 5 mm atp-na2) and
external (137 mm nacl, 4 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2,
1.8 mm cacl2, 10 mm hepes, 11 mm dextrose)
recording solutions were adjusted to ph 7.2 using
koh and to ph 7.4 with naoh, respectively. the
vehicle was either de-ionized h2o or dmso. historical
data from this lab indicate that over the course of
approximately 10 min, 1% dmso produced a 1.4 ±
1.5% (n = 11) reduction in herg current amplitude.
the lowest dilution used in the present study was
0.025% dmso. experiments were performed at 37 ±

313

1°c. currents were measured using the whole-cell
variant of the patch clamp method. glass pipettes were
pulled from borosilicate glass by a horizontal puller
(sutter instruments, novato, ca, usa) and then fire
polished to produce tip openings of 1 to 2 m m for k+
current recordings. pipette tip resistance was approximately 1.0 to 2.0 mw when filled with k+ internal solutions. bath temperature was measured by a thermistor
placed near the cell under study and was maintained
by a thermoelectric device (model no. 806-7243-01,
cambion/ midland ross, cambridge, ma, usa). an
axopatch 1-b amplifier (axon instruments, foster city,
ca, usa) was used for whole-cell voltage clamping.
creation of voltage clamp pulses and data acquisition
were controlled by an ibm pc running pclamp
software (axon instruments). after rupture of the cell
membrane (entering whole-cell mode), current kinetics
and amplitudes were allowed to stabilize as the cell
was dialyzed with internal solution and paced at 0.1 hz
using protocol a (typically 5 – 7 min). if the herg
current did not stabilize over this time period, the cell
was discarded. currents were considered stable if
currents elicited by a series of voltage pulses given at
0.1 hz were superimposed. peak herg current was
measured as the maximum outward deflection of the
tail current elicited upon return to -40 mv. experiments
were performed in the following order: establish wholecell configuration, dialyze cell and allow to reach
steady-state condition, wash in the first concentration of
the test drug, holding at -75 mv pulse at 0.1 hz until
steady state block is observed, wash in subsequent
concentrations of drug (fig. 6).
data analyses
for binding studies, the final concentration of
[3h]astemzole was calculated using the following
equation:
[m] = [(x cpm / (d ´ v ml)](1 / e)(1 m ci
/ 2.22e6 dpm)(1 / sa); where [m] is the molar
concentration, x is the measured cpm for the volume
of [3h] per assay well (20 ml) spotted on the filtermat,
d is the decay factor (note: the fractional decay was
considered negligible as all experiments were performed
within four months of synthesis of the [3h] xxxd236xxx ),
v is the assay volume (ml), e is the counter efficiency
for [3h] (approximately 0.5 cpm / dpm), sa is the
specific activity of [3h]astemzole (85 ci / mmol). assay
results were evaluated using graphpad prism software
(san diego, ca, usa). ic50 values were derived from
a 4 parameter logistics fit using prism. each inhibitor
was tested in duplicate in 5 separate experiments. ki
values were calculated using the cheng-prusoff equation
(16): ki = ic50 / [1 + ([l]/ kd)]; where ic50 is the half
maximal inhibition concentration, [l] is the ligand

314

pjs chiu et al

concentration, kd is the equilibrium dissociation
constant. the experimentally-derived saturation kd was
used for ki calculations. total bound cpm was used
to calculate the interassay and intraassay variations.
intraassay variation was calculated as the average of
daily %cv, where %cv = (standard deviation / mean
value) ´ 100. interassay variation was calculated employing the mean and standard deviation of individual
experimental means. percent cv for 7 separate experiments was determined by dividing standard deviation
with mean value. the electrophysiological data are
presented as percent reduction of current amplitude.
this was measured as current reduction after a steadystate effect had been reached in the presence of drug
relative to current amplitude before drug was introduced
(control). each cell served as its own control. potency
ranking is expressed in terms of the concentration that
causes 50% reduction of current amplitude (ic50) in nm.
results
optimization of assay conditions for [3h] xxxd236xxx 
binding using herg transfected membranes
 xxxd236xxx  binding to herg increased with protein
concentration with 91% specific binding observed at
100 m g/ ml and 95% at 400 m g/ ml (fig. 1). the
concentration of [3h] xxxd236xxx  employed equated to
approximately 14,000 to 18,000 cpm per well. the
final assay radioligand concentration consistently was
found to be in the range of 1.4 to 1.8 nm. in subsequent

assays, a protein concentration of 10 mg (100 m g / ml)
per well was selected to avoid radioligand depletion.
at this protein concentration, the obtained 8.5%
bound radioligand allowed testing under acceptable
zone a conditions (graphpad prism software, san
diego, ca, usa) and ensured a reliable window
between total and non-specific binding. a comparison
of specifically bound [3h] xxxd236xxx  to the herg
transfected hek293 cell membrane preparation and
wild-type hek293 cell membrane preparation is shown
in fig. 1. [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding above background
was observed in the wild-type hek293 cell membrane
preparation at detectable levels. however, specifically
bound signals were at least 8-fold higher in the
transfected membrane preparations.
time course of [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding in herg
transfected membranes
binding equilibrium was attained by 60 min and
binding levels remained constant for at least 180 min
at 25°c (fig. 2). a 60-min standard incubation time
was subsequently selected for all assays.

overall estimated equilibrium dissociation constant (kd)
of 5.93 ± 0.81 nm (n = 4) and receptor expression level
(bmax) of 6.36 ± 0.24 pmol / mg membrane protein
(n = 4). figure 3 depicts a representative saturation
binding experiment. the kd is an order of magnitude
lower than literature reports for [3h]dofetilide binding
to herg membranes (13). a rosenthal transformation
of some binding data (not shown) suggested the
possibility of more than one binding site class. however,
fitting such data to a two-site hyperbolic model demonstrated no improvement in correlation coefficient over a
single-site model. furthermore,  xxxd236xxx  competitive
binding data highly correlated with a one-site competition model (cf., fig. 5).
intraassay and interassay variations
intraassay variation for the [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding
assay, based on results from seven separate assays
(n = 8 – 32 each), was 11.4%, whereas interassay
variation was 14.9% (2,557 ± 380 cpm, n = 7). the
results speak for a robust [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding assay
for herg.
effect of dmso on [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding in herg

the concentration of dmso in the assay buffer of
up to 2% had little effect on [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding
(fig. 4). the final concentration of dmso used in
competition assays was 1%. test compounds could be

a summary of affinity values for 32 compounds
tested for herg binding is presented in table 1. the
inhibition curves of specific [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding by
four representative compounds from three different
therapeutic classes is shown in fig. 5.  xxxd236xxx 
demonstrated greatest potency among the 32 test
compounds against [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding, showing
ki = 3.3 ± 0.70 nm, in accord with the observed
kd = 5.91 ± 0.81 nm and ic50 of 4.2 ± 1.0 nm. these
closely similar values indicate that the [3h] xxxd236xxx 
binding assay is internally consistent and can provide
highly predictive data regarding binding affinity to
herg. in contrast, aspirin and sildenafil both showed
ki values exceeding 1 mm. furthermore, the majority
of compounds produced hill coefficients close to 1.0.
compounds that deviated significantly from 1.0
included e-4031 (0.81 ± 0.03) and loratadine
(2.05 ± 0.19). several compounds including ziprasidone
and diphenhydramine consistently displayed elevated
[3h] xxxd236xxx  binding at very high concentrations,
while binding was reduced at lower competitor concentrations. the observations are illustrated in fig. 6 with
ziprasidone. data trended upward rising above lower
plateaus defined by lower compound concentrations.
such elevated values may have been due in part to
poor solubility at high concentrations, although other
compounds (e.g., tamoxifen) did not show this behavior

such high concentrations were excluded from curve
fitting for ki estimations.
comparison of binding data with electrophysiology data
the ic50 values (n = 5 – 7) for inhibition of herg
currents in hek293 cells by 14 compounds were as
follows:  xxxd1708xxx , 6.9 nm; e-4031, 18.1 nm; amiodarone, 25.9 nm;  xxxd236xxx , 26 nm; fluoxetine, 197 nm;

is depicted in fig. 7, using  xxxd236xxx  as an example.

generated with the same compounds in hek 293, it was
demonstrated that the rank order of affinity (ki) was
highly correlative to that of inhibitory potency in the
electrophysiology studies for herg in hek 293
(rsp = 0.91, p<0.005) (fig. 8). furthermore, the 32
reference compounds including the 14 compounds
from diverse structural classes demonstrated binding
affinity values for herg with similar rank order of
inhibition of herg currents as reported in the literature
(6). however, the potency for herg inhibition in the
binding assay is in general about one order of magnitude
less than that in the electrophysiology assays (fig. 8).

discussion
the present study demonstrated that drugs known to
block herg/ ikr inhibit [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding for
herg binding sites in a competitive manner and do so
with a rank order of affinity closely parallel to that of
inhibitory potency against herg in electrophysiological studies in hek293. furthermore, the assay is
robust and has adequate sensitivity. consequently, the
[3h] xxxd236xxx  binding assay is pharmacologically relevant in detecting compounds that have affinity for the
herg/ ikr channels.
the voltage-gated herg/ ikr k+ channel contains six

both cases. data are expressed as negative log values.

transmembrane regions with a single pore. the internal
vestibule of the pore composed of residues from s5
and s6 segments facing the intracellular side contributes

pjs chiu et al

to key binding sites (tyr652 and phe656) for methanesulfoanilide compounds such as dofetilide, e4031, and
mk499; the external entry to the channel pore has
binding sites for toxins and blockers as well (4).
chadwick et al. (14) first reported the use of [3h]dofetilide binding in guinea pig myocytes, which was followed
by duff and associates (15, 17). fiset et al. (17) reported
that three class iii antiarrhythmic agents including
dofetilide, e-4031, and sotalol inhibited [3h]dofetilide
binding to the high affinity sites (related to ikr) in guinea
pig myoctes at concentrations similar to those required
to inhibit 50% of ikr in electrophysiological studies.
the characterization of herg channel binding sites in
hek293 was most recently reported by finlayson et al.
(13) using [3h]dofetilide, which showed e-4031,
 xxxd2956xxx , haloperidol and terfenadine with ki values
(nm) of 241, 71, 549, and 381, respectively, and a kd
value of 58 nm for dofetilide. our [3h] xxxd236xxx 
binding assay seems to compare favorably with the
[3h]dofetilide binding, as kd / ki values for the same
five compounds evaluated by finlayson et al. (13) were
within 2- to 5-fold of the ki values in the present
study. the higher affinity to herg inhibitors in this
[3h] xxxd236xxx  binding may be accounted for by differences in labeled ligand and assay conditions (e.g.,
amounts of herg protein, ligand concentrations, assay
temperature, etc.). in the present study, the inclusion of
0.1% bsa in both assay and wash buffers reduced
non-specific binding, which raised the signal-to-background ratio an average of 80% for 10 m g membrane
protein (data not shown). the negligible effects of bsa
in the assay buffer reported by finlayson et al. (18) were
not observed. dmso was used as a universal solvent
in a final assay concentration of 1% and had negligible
effects on competitive binding data.
abbott et al. (19) reported that herg channels coassembled with mirp1 resemble native cardiac ikr
channels. however, there is not yet evidence indicating
that absence of mirp1 affects [3h]dofetilide or
[3h] xxxd236xxx  binding assays for herg channels.
this may not be unexpected as the primary binding
sites are known to be associated with herg (4).
it is of note that this radioligand binding assay
compares favorably with functional assays using
voltage-sensitive dyes or 86rb for measurements of k+
currents, with 2 – 3-fold difference in sensitivity (9, 10).
consequently, it should be useful for screening
purposes. however, it does not lend itself to mechanistic
studies such as activation status (open versus closed
channels), voltage-dependency, and rate-dependency
relating to drug blockade, which can only be explored
by electrophysiological techniques.
in conclusion, the [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding assay in

herg transfected membranes is fully validated for
detecting compounds with affinity for herg binding
sites. the [3h] xxxd236xxx  binding assay is a rapid, highly
predictive assay which can be utilized in conjunction
with electrophysiological studies to identify compounds
that inhibit herg / ikr.
