summary  xxxd3564xxx  is a synthetic  xxxd3564xxx  with
anticonvulsant properties. the sulfamoyl group on  xxxd3564xxx  was expected to suppress seizures in a manner similar to another sulfonamide analogue, acetazolamide,
through inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. however, this does not appear to be the
primary mechanism of action since  xxxd3564xxx  requires much higher doses than acetazolamide to achieve equivalent titration in vivo.
studies with cultured neurons indicate that  xxxd3564xxx  blocks repetitive ﬁring of
voltage-sensitive sodium channels and reduces voltage-sensitive t-type calcium currents without affecting l-type calcium currents. its dual mechanism of action may
explain its efﬁcacy in patients resistant to other antiepileptic drugs (aeds).
 xxxd3564xxx  has a pharmacokinetic proﬁle favorable for clinical use. it is rapidly
and completely absorbed and has a long half-life (63—69 h in healthy volunteers)
which allows twice-daily, or even once-daily, dosing.  xxxd3564xxx  is not highly bound
to plasma proteins. consequently, it does not affect protein binding of other highly
protein-bound aeds. furthermore,  xxxd3564xxx  does not induce its own metabolism
and does not induce liver enzymes. however, since  xxxd3564xxx  is metabolized by
cytochrome p450, liver enzyme-inducing aeds will increase  xxxd3564xxx  clearance,
and dosage adjustments may be necessary when it is used in combination with certain
aeds.

introduction
 xxxd3564xxx  is a novel antiepileptic drug (aed) that
was developed in search of a less toxic, more effective anticonvulsant. the drug has been used in
japan since 1989, and is effective for simple and
complex partial seizures, generalized tonic-clonic
seizures, myoclonic epilepsies, lennox—gastaut
syndrome, and infantile spasms.1,2 in japan,  xxxd3564xxx  is currently indicated for monotherapy and

adjunctive therapy for partial onset and generalized onset seizures in adults and children. in the
united states,  xxxd3564xxx  was approved by the
food and drug administration (fda) in 2000 as an
adjunctive treatment for partial seizures.
the drug’s broad spectrum of activity and favorable pharmacokinetic proﬁle offer certain advantages in the epilepsy treatment armamentarium.
chemically distinct from other aeds,  xxxd3564xxx 
has been shown to be effective in patients whose
seizures are resistant to other aeds.  xxxd3564xxx ’s
long plasma elimination half-life has allowed it to
be used in a once-daily or twice-daily treatment
regimen in japan.2

chemistry

mechanism of action
the anticonvulsant activity of  xxxd3564xxx , which
shares pharmacological properties with phenytoin,
carbamazepine, and sodium valproate, has been
demonstrated in many animal and cultured neuron
models, as well as in clinical studies.
like phenytoin and carbamazepine,  xxxd3564xxx 
blocks the spread or propagation of seizure discharges.  xxxd3564xxx  has been shown to prevent
the tonic extensor components of maximal electroshock seizures in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs;3
restrict the spread of focal seizures evoked by
electrical stimulation of the visual cortex in cats;4
and prevent the propagation of seizures from the
cortex to subcortical structures, which are evoked
by cortical freezing in cats,4 and by electrical
stimulation in visual cortex-kindled cats.5
it is believed that  xxxd3564xxx ’s effect on the
propagation of seizure discharges involves blocking
the repetitive ﬁring of voltage-sensitive sodium
channels, and reducing voltage-sensitive t-type
calcium currents without affecting l-type calcium
currents. these mechanisms stabilize neuronal
membranes and suppress neuronal hypersynchronization, leading to the suppression of partial
seizures and generalized tonic—clonic seizures in
humans.2,6
 xxxd3564xxx  possesses mechanisms of action that
are similar to those of sodium valproate, e.g., suppression of epileptogenic activity and depression of
neuronal responses. these mechanisms are thought
to contribute to the suppression of absence and myoclonic seizures.2
since  xxxd3564xxx  has a sulfamoyl group on its side
chain, it was anticipated that the drug might exert its anticonvulsant effects in a manner similar

hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of zon-

to the related compound acetazolamide, which inhibits seizure activity, i.e. via inhibition of carbonic
anhydrase. however, when  xxxd3564xxx  was compared with acetazolamide in vivo,  xxxd3564xxx  had
only weak carbonic anhydrase inhibiting activity,
requiring 100—1000 times higher doses than acetazolamide to achieve equivalent inhibition.3 thus,
carbonic anhydrase inhibition was ruled out as the
primary mechanism of action of  xxxd3564xxx .2 the
presence of a methylene group on  xxxd3564xxx ’s side
chain may explain the differences in carbonic anhydrase inhibition.
unlike some other aeds,  xxxd3564xxx  does not
appear to affect the synaptic activity induced by
␥- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) or glutamate,2 as do
other aeds.
one study has suggested that the anticonvulsant
effect of  xxxd3564xxx  may also involve protecting
neurons from free radical damage. in this in vitro
study, as  xxxd3564xxx  dosage increased, activity of
hydroxyl and  xxxd2738xxx  radicals decreased (figs. 2
and 3). hydroxyl radicals are thought to be the most
harmful radical for neuromembranes.  xxxd2738xxx ,
a messenger molecule in the central nervous system, may also cause pathological nervous tissue
damage under some conditions.7

the methanesulfonamide group even though it has a
sulfamoyl group in common with acetazolamide, an
arylsulfonamide analog that also has anticonvulsant
properties.2,3

in summary,  xxxd3564xxx  is believed to exert anticonvulsant effects by blocking sustained, repetitive
neuronal ﬁring via a blockade of voltage-sensitive
sodium and by reducing voltage-sensitive t-type
calcium channels.  xxxd3564xxx  has no effect on
neuronal responses to gaba or glutamate, and its
activity is not due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition.

pharmacokinetics
 xxxd3564xxx  is rapidly and completely absorbed,
with peak plasma concentrations occurring 2—4 h
following 100- to 400 mg oral doses in healthy
volunteers.6 the mean plasma elimination half-life
is long-about 60 h in noninduced subjects after single and multiple doses,6 with ranges from 52 to
69 h reported.8
steady state plasma concentrations of  xxxd3564xxx  in placebo-controlled studies ranged
from 1.9 to 55.3 ␮g/ml (median, 18 ␮g/ml) after
10—12 days of dosing.6 the plasma or serum levels of  xxxd3564xxx  have been shown to be linearly
dose-related in adult and pediatric patients.2
at  xxxd3564xxx  concentrations of 1.0—7.0 ␮g/ml,
the drug is only about 40% bound to human plasma
proteins.6 however,  xxxd3564xxx  has a high binding
afﬁnity for red blood cells (rbcs), and a marked
concentration of  xxxd3564xxx  is observed in human
red blood cells.2 the afﬁnity of  xxxd3564xxx  for rbcs
is 8 times higher than that for plasma proteins,6 and
is dependent on the extracellular concentration of
 xxxd3564xxx .2 for plasma concentrations >5 ␮g/ml,
the  xxxd3564xxx  plasma versus erythrocyte concentration relationship appears to be relatively linear
due to a dominant passive-diffusion distribution
process.
 xxxd3564xxx  undergoes acetylation to form
n-acetyl  xxxd3564xxx , and reduction to form the

figure 4

open ring metabolite, 2-sulfamoylacetyl phenol
(smap) (fig. 4).9
reduction of  xxxd3564xxx  to smap is mediated by
the cytochrome p450 isozyme 3a4.10  xxxd3564xxx 
does not induce its own metabolism and does not
induce liver enzymes.8
urine is the major route of  xxxd3564xxx  excretion
in humans; excretion in feces is a minor elimination
route.2 following multiple dosing, 62% of the radiolabelled dose was recovered in the urine, with 3% in
the feces. of the excreted dose, 35% was recovered
as  xxxd3564xxx , 15% as n-acetyl  xxxd3564xxx , and 50%
as the glucuronide of smap.6

drug interactions
since  xxxd3564xxx  is not highly bound to plasma proteins, it does not affect protein binding of other
highly protein-bound aeds. protein binding of  xxxd3564xxx  is unaffected in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin, phenobarbital, or
carbamazepine.6
since  xxxd3564xxx  is metabolized by the  xxxg590xxx , other drugs that induce or
inhibit this enzyme may induce or inhibit  xxxd3564xxx  metabolism. concomitant administration
of phenytoin and carbamazepine increases  xxxd3564xxx  clearance from 0.32 to 0.51 ml/(min kg).
the plasma elimination half-life of  xxxd3564xxx  is
decreased to 27 h by phenytoin, to 38 h by phenobarbital and carbamazepine, and to 46 h by sodium
valproate.6 the differential effects of phenytoin
and carbamazepine were also documented in a
study where  xxxd3564xxx  was administered to patients receiving phenytoin or carbamazepine as
monotherapy. the area under the curve (auc) of
 xxxd3564xxx  was 20% higher in the carbamazepine
group compared to the phenytoin group (table 1).11

concomitant administration of  xxxd3564xxx  with
phenobarbital, phenytoin, or carbamazepine significantly decreased the concentration-to-dose (c/d)
ratio (ratio of the steady-state plasma concentration to the administered dose) of  xxxd3564xxx ,
whereas clonazepam and sodium valproate did
not change the c/d ratio (table 2). in one clinical trial, the ratio of plasma concentration of
carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, the major active
metabolite of carbamazepine, to the plasma concentration of carbamazepine, was decreased by
concomitant administration of  xxxd3564xxx , but
the signiﬁcance of this is not clear.12 a number of
studies have evaluated the effect of  xxxd3564xxx 
on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs, including
aeds, and have concluded that concomitant administration of  xxxd3564xxx  does not affect serum
concentrations of carbamazepine, phenytoin,
or sodium valproate to any clinically signiﬁcant
extent.

conclusions
the pharmacokinetic proﬁle of  xxxd3564xxx  is favorable for clinical treatment of seizures.  xxxd3564xxx 
is rapidly and completely absorbed. its long plasma

elimination half-life allows for twice-daily, or even
once-daily, dosing. its dual mechanism of action
may account for its efﬁcacy in patients resistant to
other aeds.
 xxxd3564xxx  does not affect protein binding of
other highly protein-bound aeds, such as phenytoin
or carbamazepine. however, liver enzyme-inducing
aeds (such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, sodium
valproate, or phenobarbital) will increase the
plasma clearance of  xxxd3564xxx , shorten its
half-life, and lower its concentration/dose ratio.
therefore, dosage adjustments may be necessary to maintain therapeutic levels of the drug
when it is used in combination with certain
aeds.
