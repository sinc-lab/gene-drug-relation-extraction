abstract
background:  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) has multiple physiologic roles mediated by g protein
coupled receptors designated e-prostanoid, or "ep" receptors. evidence supports an important
role for the  xxxg1873xxx  in regulating fertility, vascular tone and renal function.
results: the full-length rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  cdna was cloned. the encoded polypeptide contains
361 amino acid residues with seven hydrophobic domains. cos-1 cells expressing the cloned rabbit
 xxxg1873xxx  exhibited specific [3h]pge2 binding with a kd of 19.1± 1.7 nm. [3h]pge2 was displaced by
unlabeled ligands in the following order: pge2>> xxxg1073xxx =pgf2alpha= xxxd2331xxx . binding of [3h]pge2 was
also displaced by ep receptor subtype selective agonists with a rank order of affinity consistent with
the  xxxg1873xxx  (butaprost>ah13205>misoprostol>sulprostone). butaprost free acid produced
a concentration-dependent increase in camp accumulation in rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  transfected cos-1 cells
with a half-maximal effective concentration of 480 nm. rnase protection assay revealed high
expression in the ileum, spleen, and liver with lower expression in the kidney, lung, heart, uterus,
adrenal gland and skeletal muscle. in situ hybridization localized  xxxg1873xxx  mrna to the uterine
endometrium, but showed no distinct localization in the kidney.  xxxg1873xxx  mrna expression along the
nephron was determined by rt-pcr and its expression was present in glomeruli, mcd, tdl and
ccd. in cultured cells  xxxg1873xxx  was not detected in collecting ducts but was detected in renal
interstitial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells.  xxxg1873xxx  mrna was also detected in arteries, veins,
and preglomerular vessels of the kidney.
conclusion:  xxxg1873xxx  expression pattern is consistent with the known functional roles for camp
coupled pge2 effects in reproductive and vascular tissues and renal interstitial cells. it remains
uncertain whether it is also expressed in renal tubules.

background
 xxxd1903xxx  is a major cyclooxygenase metabolite of
 xxxd208xxx  which exerts diverse effects on vascular

smooth muscle tone and epithelial solute transport via gprotein coupled receptors [1,2]. at least four distinct gprotein coupled pge2 receptors have been cloned: the

ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx [1]. pharmacological studies suggest pge2 relaxes vascular smooth muscle through two of
these receptors, the  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors, which couple
to cyclic-amp generation [3]. in contrast, pge2 constricts
other vascular smooth muscle through ep3 receptors
which inhibit camp generation via gi or ep1 receptors
which increase ca2+ mobilization [3]. although both  xxxg1873xxx 
and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors relax smooth muscle,  xxxg1873xxx  receptors are
uniquely sensitive to the agonists butaprost and ah13205
[3,4]. previous studies have shown that pge2 increases the
camp concentration in many tissues including kidney, intestine and uterus, but the relative contribution of  xxxg1873xxx  versus  xxxg1875xxx  receptors to these effects is incompletely defined
[5,6]. recent studies in mice with targeted disruption of
these receptors have suggested an important role for  xxxg1873xxx 
receptor in regulating systemic hemodynamics. deficiency of the  xxxg1873xxx  is associated with a defect in counteracting vasopressor effect of pge2 [7] and the
development of salt sensitive hypertension [8], suggesting
a predominant normal vasodepressor role of  xxxg1873xxx 
in blood pressure regulation.
the vasodepressor action of pge2 may also play an important role in the kidney. it has been previously shown
that pge2 not only directly dilates renal arteries [9–11]
but also attenuates the angii-induced increase in renal
vascular resistance [12] through inhibition of angii-elicited intracellular ca++ increase in vascular smooth muscle
cells of preglomerular vasculature [13]. based on the fact
that pge2 stimulates camp generation in freshly isolated
preglomerular renal arterioles [14], the camp-stimulating
 xxxg1873xxx  or  xxxg1875xxx  receptor has been thought to mediate these effects of pge2 on renal resistance vessels.

coding exon was contained in clone 6a. sequence data indicated that the entire coding region was present in these
two exons. a potential translation initiation codon in the
noti/bamhi fragment (3 kb) of clone 4b1 starts an open
reading frame that encodes a polypeptide sequence highly
homologous to the first six transmembrane domains of
the human  xxxg1873xxx  [20]. the amino acid sequence of
the open reading frame in the noti fragment (6 kb) of
clone 6a was homologous to the seventh transmembrane
domain (tmd vii), followed by a short c-terminal tail
and an in-frame stop codon. an intron with a donor and
acceptor splice site was located following the coding region corresponding to the sixth transmembrane domain
of the protein.
a functional cdna clone was obtained by screening a rabbit uterus cdna library using a 700 bp avaii cdna fragment from clone 4b1. two types of positive overlapping
clones (18a and rep2-2.7) were isolated. of the 18 positive cdna clones isolated, 8 belonged to the type designated rep2-18a, and 10 clones belonged to the type
designated rep2-2.7. sequence analysis indicated that
these two cdnas possess an identical open reading frame
and 1,664 bp of down-stream 3' untranslated region
(3'utr), however clone rep2-18a possesses an 467 additional base pairs in the 3'utr compared with rep2-2.7. it
is also noted that there are 6 and 7 auuua motifs in 3'
utr of rep2-2.7 and rep2-18a, respectively, suggesting
an instability of rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  mrna in vivo.

results

because both rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  cdna clones, 18a and rep2-2.7,
lacked ~50 codons corresponding to the 5' end of the human  xxxg1873xxx  and which were present in the rabbit genomic sequence, a full-length sequence of the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx 
was constructed by ligating a sacii/xhoi cdna fragment
(nucleotide 340–1655) from the cdna clone 18a with
the upstream hind iii/sacii fragment (nucleotide 1–340)
of the rabbit genomic clone. this created an open reading
frame of 1,083 base pairs with an in-frame tga stop codon. the existence of this 5' utr sequence in native cdna
was confirmed by rt-pcr on rna isolated from rabbit
uterus (data not shown). the predicted polypeptide is
comprised of 361 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of ~40 kda. its hydrophobic profile reveals the
presence of seven hydrophobic stretches characteristic of
g-protein-coupled receptors [20] (fig. 1). comparison of
the deduced amino acid sequence of rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  with human and mouse  xxxg1873xxx  shows 90% and 82% sequence identity, respectively (fig. 1).

receptor isolation
screening of 5 × 105 plaques from a rabbit genomic library using a full-length human cdna for the  xxxg1873xxx  resulted in isolation of two independent clones
designated 4b1 (13 kb) and 6a (11 kb). a 5' coding exon
of  xxxg1873xxx  was contained in clone 4b1, while a 3'

ligand binding properties of the  xxxg1873xxx 
the putative rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  was pharmacologically
characterized using membranes from cos-1 cells transiently transfected with a rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  expression vector,
pcdna3/rep2. membranes from  xxxg1873xxx  transfected

there is also evidence suggesting that intrarenal  xxxg1873xxx  and
 xxxg1875xxx  receptor activates camp-stimulated salt and water
transport along the nephron [15–18]. although the localization of ep1, ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx  has been determined in human kidney by in situ hybridization, segmental
distribution of camp-coupled  xxxg1873xxx  along the nephron was not detected by this method [19]. to more
clearly define the physiologic role of this camp coupled
ep receptor, we cloned the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx , characterized its pharmacology and signaling. these studies also
defined the tissue distribution with a focus on vascular,
intrarenal and reproductive localization of the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx 
receptor mrna.

dissociation constant of 19.1 ± 1.7 nm, and a maximum
binding capacity (bmax) of 2.8 pmol/mg of membrane
protein. radioligand binding studies were performed using various prostanoids and ep-receptor subtype-specific
agonists to compete for pge2 binding. competition binding experiments revealed a rank order affinity consistent
with an ep receptor: pge2 >>  xxxd2331xxx  =  xxxg1073xxx  = pgf2alpha
(fig. 2a). [3h]pge2 binding was partially displaced by the
 xxxg1873xxx /3/4 agonist misoprostol and was not displaced by the
ep1/3 agonist sulprostone (fig. 2b). furthermore, the  xxxg1873xxx 
selective agonists butaprost free acid and ah13205 competed for [3h]pge2 binding with ki values of 3–7 µm and
3–4 µm, respectively, suggesting this receptor is the rabbit
 xxxg1873xxx  [20,21].

incubation of  xxxg1873xxx -transfected cos1 cells with butaprost
free acid produced a concentration-dependent increase in
camp accumulation with an ec50 of 480 nm (fig. 3).
cells transfected with the vector alone demonstrated no
significant increase in camp in response to butaprost free
acid.

solution hybridization/rnase protection assays with a radiolabeled antisense  xxxg1873xxx  riboprobe resulted in a rnaseresistant fragment of the appropriate size (322 bp, fig. 4).
 xxxg1873xxx  mrna was detected in several tissues including ileum, spleen, and liver. lower expression was found
in kidney, uterus, lung, heart, liver, adrenal gland, brain,
urinary bladder and skeletal muscle. furthermore,  xxxg1873xxx  mrna was detected by rnase protection assay in
all blood vessels examined (fig. 5) including arteries and
veins of large and small caliber (fig. 5a & 5c), and renal
preglomerular vasculature (fig. 5b). the expression level
of the  xxxg1873xxx  mrna in these vessels was comparable
to that of the  xxxg1875xxx  receptor (fig. 5).  xxxg1873xxx  mrna
was also detected in vascular smooth muscle cells cultured
from rabbit aorta (fig. 6a).

intrarenal localization of the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx 
in situ hybridization was performed to examine the distribution of the  xxxg1873xxx  gene expression in the kidney
and uterus. sections of rabbit renal and uterine tissues
were hybridized with the [35s]-labeled riboprobe from
the same cdna probe used in rnase-protection assays. as
observed for the mouse  xxxg1873xxx  in the uterus, a significant hybridization signal was detected mainly in the endometrial
epithelium of the rabbit uterus with less expression in myometrium (fig. 7). consistent with previous observation
in man [19], only a diffuse weak  xxxg1873xxx  mrna signal was detected in the rabbit kidney (figure 7). to further elucidate
the distribution of  xxxg1873xxx  along the nephron, nephron segments were dissected and expression of  xxxg1873xxx  was
determined using rt-pcr. as shown in figure 8, pcr
products with expected sizes were obtained for both  xxxg1873xxx 
receptor (336 bp) and  xxxg861xxx  (411 bp). identity of the
amplified products was confirmed by southern hybridization (not shown) and sequencing. as positive control, rtpcr was performed using 1 µg of total rna isolated from
rabbit spleen (figure 8). as negative control, pcr were
also performed in the absence of reverse transcription
without identifiable product, indicating the origination of
pcr products were from mrna other than genomic dna
(figure 8).  xxxg1873xxx  mrna was easily detected in
glomeruli and medullary collecting ducts (mcd). detectable  xxxg1873xxx  mrna was also present in thin descending limbs
of henle (tdl) and cortical collecting ducts (ccd).

100 bp ladder was used as a size marker. densitometry was
used to quantitate  xxxg1873xxx  mrna expression, rna loading was
corrected by normalizing to  xxxg861xxx  mrna expression.

in cultured cells rnase protection assay detected  xxxg1873xxx  expression in renal medullary interstitial cells (mics), while
no signal was detected in cultured cortical collecting ducts
or glomerular mesangial cells (fig. 6b & 6c).  xxxg1873xxx  mrna
was also detected in cultured rabbit aortic vascular
smooth muscle cells (figure 6a).

discussion
the present studies describe the cloning and characterization of the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx . with this information,
cdna sequence for all four rabbit ep receptors is now
available [22–24]. several similarities between the rabbit
and mouse  xxxg1873xxx  receptors exist [5,21]. the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  genomic clone contains an intron with consensus splice donor and acceptor sites near the end of transmembrane
domain (tm) vi. the relative position of the intron to the
coding regions is also identical to that found in the human tp, the human and mouse dp, and the human ep1
gene [2]. this provides further evidence that the prostanoid receptor family arose from a common ancestral gene.
the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  gene contains a 1,083 bp open reading
frame coding for a 361 amino acid polypeptide, with a
calculated molecular weight of 39,919 daltons. its amino
acid profile reveals the presence of seven hydrophobic regions which likely represent transmembrane domains.
unlike the tp and ep3 receptors, no alternative splicing in
the  xxxg1873xxx  was found in the coding region [21,25].
diversity of  xxxg1873xxx  mrnas in the mouse was found in both
the 5' utr and the 3' utr [21]. similar diversity in the 3'
sequence of the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  cdna clones isolated
from the uterine library was observed in the present studies. the significance of this mrna splicing is not yet
known, but it might play a role in stability or translation
efficiency of  xxxg1873xxx  transcripts [21].

ligand binding studies confirm that the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  preferentially binds pge2 with significantly higher affinity than other endogenous prostanoids. its low affinity
for  xxxg1073xxx , pgf2alpha,  xxxd2331xxx , misoprostol and sulprostone
suggest it is not an ep1, ep3 or  xxxg1879xxx  [2,3]. as demonstrated for the  xxxg1873xxx  in other species [6,20,21],
butaprost free acid and ah 13205, two synthetic pg agonists with selectivity for the  xxxg1873xxx  subtype, efficiently and
dose dependently compete for [3h] pge2 binding to this
newly cloned rabbit receptor. inhibition of pge2 binding
to the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  by ah13205 is about 100 times
greater than that to rabbit  xxxg1875xxx  in transfected cos-1 cells
(unpublished data). finally, the  xxxg1873xxx  selective agonist butaprost free acid dose-dependently stimulated camp generation in cos-1 cells transfected with the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx 

receptor. these results are in agreement with observations
with human, rat and mouse  xxxg1873xxx  receptors [6,20,21],
which also couple to camp generation. taken together,
these results clearly demonstrate that the pharmacology of
this receptor corresponds to an  xxxg1873xxx  rather than
an  xxxg1875xxx  receptor.
the expression level of rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  mrna is relatively low. nuclease protection analysis demonstrated
rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  expression is highest in ileum, liver, and
spleen, with a lower expression in kidney, uterus, brain,
adrenal gland, lung, heart, bladder, stomach and skeletal
muscle. this mrna expression pattern is similar to that of
the  xxxg1873xxx  in the mouse [5,21]. pge2 has been reported to
stimulate camp formation in many tissues, including in-

29]. the mrna expression results are consistent with
these functional studies and suggest that the  xxxg1873xxx 
plays important roles in mediating pge2 stimulated
camp generation in these tissues [14,21,26–33].

the presence of the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  mrna in the uterus also support a role for this receptor as an important mediator of pge2 action in this organ. this is in agreement
with previous studies which demonstrate that  xxxg1873xxx  is expressed and highly regulated in uterine luminal epithelium cells by ovarian steroids during the peri-implantation

in gs protein content and camp concentration in midgestation and the decrease at term [26,27]. because the
 xxxg1873xxx  is a gs-coupled camp-stimulating receptor,

the  xxxg1873xxx  may participate in the physiological regulation of uterine relaxation during pregnancy and the
transition into uterine contraction at the onset of the labor. lack of normal uterine  xxxg1873xxx  expression may also con-

specific regions of  xxxg1873xxx  mrna expression could
be detected in rabbit kidney by in situ hybridization [19].
nonetheless, low levels of  xxxg1873xxx  mrna expression
were detected by rt-pcr or rnase protection assay in nephron segments within the kidney including preglomerular vasculature, glomeruli, thin limbs of henle's loop and
collecting ducts. the expression of  xxxg1873xxx  mrna in
medullary collecting duct is distinct from functional studies in the cortical collecting duct where butaprost had no
functional effect [17,18]. these data suggest a possible
unique role for the  xxxg1873xxx  in the medullary collecting duct as opposed to cortical collecting duct. alternatively the pcr detection of  xxxg1873xxx  expression in
these microdissected segments might result from the adherent renal interstitial cells other than collecting duct itself, since nuclease protection analysis revealed a
relatively high  xxxg1873xxx  level in cultured intersitial cells but
failed to detect  xxxg1873xxx  expression in cultured collecting duct
cells. it is notable that glomeruli and collecting ducts are
distinguished from other segments by high number of adherent cells. selective expression of the  xxxg1873xxx  in interstitial cells is consistent with a lack of segmental
localization by in situ hybridization. whether the  xxxg1873xxx  participates in pge2 stimulated camp generation
in epithelial cells along the nephron awaits further investigation [14,42].

[8,36].

conclusions

pge2 also plays a critical role in regulating systemic blood
pressure [37,38]. although the receptor mediating the
predominant vasodilator effect of pge2 remains only partially defined, recent gene targeting studies suggest that
the  xxxg1873xxx  may be an important vasodilator in vivo[7,8]. the rabbit ear artery has been used as a classic
pharmacological model of an  xxxg1873xxx  responsive tissue, while
the rabbit jugular vein has been proposed to be an  xxxg1875xxx 
bearing target tissue [3,4,39], however in the present studies  xxxg1873xxx  mrna was detected in both vessels.  xxxg1873xxx 
mrna expression was also detected in the rabbit aorta
and inferior vena cava thus providing further evidence
that the  xxxg1873xxx  is functionally expressed in both arteries and veins. expression of this gs-coupled campstimulating pge2 receptor in cultured vascular smooth
muscle cells isolated from the aorta supports a direct role
of the  xxxg1873xxx  in mediating vascular relaxation.

materials and methods

pge2 has also been shown to stimulate camp formation
in several renal tissues, notably preglomerular microvasculature [14], renal glomeruli [40], thin descending limb
[41], medullary and cortical thick ascending limb, and
collecting duct [29,42]. although  xxxg1873xxx  mrna expression was detected in the kidney and this was more
pronounced in the renal cortex than in the medulla, no

in summary, we have cloned and expressed a butaprost
sensitive rabbit pge2 receptor that stimulates camp formation and is present in many rabbit tissues. physiological effects of pge2 through the  xxxg1873xxx  may mediate
important physiological actions in these tissues.  xxxg1873xxx  expression in uterus, vasculature and the kidney suggests
that this receptor may play important roles in the functions of reproductive system, vascular tissues and interstitium of the kidney.

rabbit genomic library screening
a rabbit genomic library in lamda dash® ii vector (stratagene) was screened with [32p]-labeled full-length human
 xxxg1873xxx  (gift from dr. d. woodward, allergan pharmaceuticals) [20]. the filters were fixed by ultraviolet light expo-

sure (stratalinker, stratagene) and hybridized 18 hours at
56°c in a solution containing 6x ssc, 5x denhardt's,
0.1% sds, 150 µg/ml denatured herring sperm dna and
3 × 106 cpm/ml labeled probe. two representative positive clones, 4b and 6a, were isolated from 5 × 105 recombinant plaques and shown to exhibit unique restriction
patterns. a xbai/noti fragment from clone 4b1 and a noti
fragment from 6a1 hybridized to the probe and were subcloned in pbluesript ii sk(-) (stratagene) for further analysis.
cdna cloning
a rabbit uterus cdna library in zap ii (stratagene) (a gift
from dr. j. lytton, harvard medical school) was screened
using an avaii cdna fragment of 750 bp from the genomic clone 4b1. 106 plaques were probed under high stringency, and 18 positive plaques were purified. the isolated
cdna-bearing phages were rescued to plasmids according
to the manufacturer's instruction. clones were analyzed
by restriction digestion, and nucleotide sequencing was
carried out on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method.
construction of an open reading frame of  xxxg1873xxx  and its expression in cos-1 cells
one 5' truncated cdna clone, rep2-18a, was highly homologous to the human  xxxg1873xxx  but lacked the 5'
150 bp encoding the first 50 amino acids (see results).
rep2-18a was digested by sac ii/xho i, and the 3' restriction fragment (1,312 bp) was ligated to the sac ii/hind iii
fragment (350 bp) of the 4b1 genomic clone at the sac ii
site. this resulted in a 1.7 kb fragment, yz4, containing a
putative open reading frame. yz4 was then subcloned
into the eukaryotic expression vector pcdna3 (invitrogen) and the resultant plasmid, pcdna3/rep2, was transfected into cos-1 using lipofectamine according to the
manufacturer's directions (life science technologies)
with 12 µg plasmid dna and 45 µl lipofectamine solution. cells were cultured for 72 hours, and 5 mm sodium
butyrate was added to culture medium 16 hours before
lysis. total cell membranes were prepared as described
previously [23].
ligand binding analysis
saturation isotherm ligand binding experiments were performed using 15–20 µg of membrane protein incubated
with increasing concentrations of [3h] pge2 at 30°c for 2
hours, in binding buffer (25 mm kpo4, ph6.2, 10 mm
mgcl2, and 1 mm edta). the reaction was stopped by
adding 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer followed by rapid
filtration on inotech ih-201-a21 glass fiber filters employing an inotech 96 well filtration manifold (inotech
biosystems, lansing, mi). filters then were washed 3
times with binding buffer, dried briefly and counted in a
beckman ls 6500 multi-purpose scintillation counter.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/2/14

nonspecific binding was defined as the radioactivity remaining bound to the filter in the presence of 50 µm unlabelled pge2. for competition binding assays, 20 µg of
membrane protein was incubated with 1 nm [3h]pge2
and varying concentrations of unlabeled competitors. reactions were carried out as above.
camp measurements
cos1 cells were transiently transfected with the  xxxg1873xxx  expression plasmid were distributed onto 24-well
plates. the medium was replaced 24 hours later and incubated one additional hour at 37°c in 450 µl dmem plus
0.25 mm  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ), and 40
mm indomethacin. following this medium containing
varying amounts of butaprost free acid was added to each
well for 5 minutes. the reactions were stopped by addition of 500 µl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. camp measurement of the cell lysates were performed by an eia
according to manufacturer's instructions (stratagene).
isolation of renal microvessels and dissection of nephron
segments
renal preglomerular microvessels were isolated according
to a protocol from chaudhari and kirschenbaum [43].
briefly, in anesthetized animals kidneys were exposed and
the renal artery cannulated. the kidneys were perfused
with 10 ml of ice cold normal saline, followed by 10 ml
of a 1% suspension of magnetized iron oxide (fe3o4,
aldrich) in normal saline. the cortex of the kidneys was
minced with a tissue press and homogenized using a polytron homogenizer at moderate speed for 15 s ×2. microvessels were separated from nonvascular tissue in several
washing steps (in 1× pbs) utilizing a strong magnet field.
washing and separation were repeated after passing the
homogenate through 20-, 21- and 23-gauge needles, respectively, until the suspension was mostly free of glomeruli and other nonvascular tissue. this technique provided
a large quantity of relatively pure preglomerular microvessels, with approximately 10–15 % of the suspension consisting of attached glomeruli and early segments of
proximal tubules. microdissection of nephron segments
was performed in the kidney of new zealand white rabbit
as previously described [44]. the following segments were
dissected: glomeruli, proximal convoluted tubules (pct),
proximal straight tubules (pst), thin limbs of henle's
loop (tdl/tal), thick ascending limb (tal), distal convoluted tubules (dct), cortical collecting ducts (ccd) and
medullary collecting duct (mcd) cells.
pcr ampification of rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  fragment
total rna was purified from dissected nephron segments
using tri reagent (molecular research center) and reverse-transcribed to single-stranded cdna using moloney
murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and 2.5 µm of
random hexamers according to the manufacturer's proto-

col (geneamp rna pcr kit, perkin elmer cetus, norwalk, ct). the cdnas were then amplified using  xxxg1873xxx  and
 xxxg861xxx  selective primers. primers were selected from rabbit cdna sequences. for rabbit  xxxg1873xxx : 5'-tcc tcc cga

primers were used to amplify a 336 bp of  xxxg1873xxx  cdna fragment and 411 bp of  xxxg861xxx  cdna fragment. pcr reactions were carried out in 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.3), 50
mm kcl, 2.5 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm dntps and 1 µm primers at 94°c for 0.5 min, 60°c for 0.5 min, and 72°c for 1.0
min for 35 cycles in a perkin elmer cetus 9600 thermal cycler. pcr products were separated by 1% agarose gel and
further confirmed by southern hybridization and sequencing.
culture of rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells (vsmcs), cortical collecting duct cells (ccd), glomerular mesangial
cells (mcs) and renal medullary interstitial cells (mics)
the aorta was cut open in a longitudinal section and the
thin layer of endothelial cells was removed using a cottontipped applicator. the aorta was cut into small pieces and
suspended in dmem medium containing 20 % fcs and
grown in a culture dish in standard incubation at 37°c.
one week later, the vsmcs had outgrown from the tissue
suspension, and were transferred to a new flask. the medium was changed every other day, the identity of the vsmcs was confirmed by alpha-actin fluorescence staining as
described [45]. glomerular mcs, ccd cells and mics
were cultured as we previously reported [22,44,46].
solution hybridization/rnase protection assays
rnase protection assays were performed as described previously [22]. a hind iii fragment of the rabbit  xxxg1873xxx  located in the the 3' untranslated region (3'utr) was
subcloned into pbluescript sk(-) plasmid (stratagene).
plasmids containing rabbit ep1 (250 bp) [22]  xxxg1873xxx  (322
bp), ep3 (466 bp) [24] and  xxxg1875xxx  (328 bp) [23] were used
to synthesize crna probes for solution hybridization of
total rna from various tissues. briefly, the fragments of
ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx  cdna were subcloned in pbluscript
sk(-) vector, and the antisense orientation was determined by dideoxy-dna sequencing. radiolabeled riboprobes were synthesized from linearized plasmid dna (1
µg) transcribed in vitro with 10 u of t3 rna polymerase
by using maxiscript™ kit (ambion) for 1 hour at 37°c in
a total reaction volume of 20 µl. the reaction buffer contained 10 mm dithiothreitol (dtt), 0.5 µm of atp, ctp,
and gtp, 2.5 µm of utp, and 5 µl of 800 ci/mmol [alpha-32p]
utp  xxxd1891xxx  mci/ml (dupont nen). hybridization buffer
included 80% deionized formamide, 100 mm sodium citrate, ph6.4, 300 mm sodium acetate, ph6.4 and 1 mm
edta (rpaii, ambion). twenty micrograms of total

rnas from rabbit tissues, preglomerular vessels, cultured
cells were incubated at 45°c overnight in hybridization
buffer with 1 × 105 cpm labeled riboprobe. after hybridization, ribonuclease digestion (20 mg/ml) was carried out
at 37°c for 30 minutes. precipitated protected fragments
were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 200 v for
3.5 hours. end-labeled 100 bp dna markers were used as
molecular weight standards (promega). the gel was exposed to kodak xar-5 film overnight at -80°c, with intensifying screens.
in situ hybridization
in situ hybridization was performed as previously described [22]. rabbit uterus and kidney were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. seven µm
sections were cut and hybridized with [35s]-labeled riboprobe used in the rnase protection assays at 55°c for 18
hours. following hybridization, sections were washed at
50°c in 50% formamide, 2x ssc, and 100 mm beta- xxxd26xxx  for 60 minutes. sections were treated with
 xxxg1963xxx  (10 µg/ml) at 37°c for 30 minutes, followed by
washes in 10 mm tris, 5 mm edta, 500 mm nacl at
37°c; 2x ssc at 50°c; and 0.1x ssc at 50°c. slides were
dehydrated with ethanol containing 300 mm ammonium
acetate. photomicrographs were taken from slides dipped
in emulsion (ilford k5, knutsford, cheshire, england) diluted 1:1 with 2% glycerol and exposed for 7 days at 4°c.
after developing in kodak d-19, slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. photomicrographs
were taken by a zeiss axioskop microscope using darkfield optics.
data analysis
all binding assays and camp measurements were plotted
using prism (graphpad, san diego, ca).
