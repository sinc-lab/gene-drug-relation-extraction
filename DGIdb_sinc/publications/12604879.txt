the ventricular tachyarrhythmias associated with the  xxxg2028xxx  syndrome are typically bradycardia-dependent. however, some episodes can be associated with exercise or emotional stress, suggesting a different arrhythmogenic
mechanism when sympathetic activity predominates. this study examined the potential arrhythmogenic mechanisms during periods of autonomically mediated transient heart rate acceleration in a canine anthopleurin-a model
of  xxxg2028xxx  syndrome. using plunge needle electrodes, transmural unipolar electrograms of the left ventricle were
recorded from endocardial (endo), mid-myocardial (mid) and epicardial (epi) sites. the activation – recovery
interval (ari) was measured to estimate local refractoriness. the cardiac cycle length was gradually shortened by
cessation of vagal stimulation (vagal stimulation protocol (vsp)), and intramural electrograms and onset mode of
ventricular tachyarrhythmias were analyzed in 7 experiments. the vsp was performed 8 times before and 5 times
after administration of  xxxd2635xxx  in each experiment. before  xxxd2635xxx , vagal stimulation slowed the heart rate
and created large transmural ari dispersion because of a greater ari prolongation at mid rather than epi/endo
sites. after cessation of vagal stimulation, unipolar electrograms started to show ari alternans and ventricular
premature beats developed sporadically. sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced in 12 of the 56
trials of the vsp. initiation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was associated with delayed conduction at mid/endo
sites.  xxxd2635xxx  attenuated transmural ari dispersion, and neither ari alternans nor ventricular tachyarrhythmias was observed during all 35 trials of the vsp after  xxxd2635xxx  administration. heart rate acceleration induced
by an abrupt shift to a state of predominant sympathetic activity enhances arrhythmias in this  xxxg2028xxx  model.  xxxd2635xxx  homogenizes ventricular repolarization, suppresses premature complexes and was antiarrhythmic during
ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by the vsp. (circ j 2003; 67: 263 – 268)

ecent clinical and experimental studies of the congenital long qt syndrome (lqts) have shown
that the triggers of the ventricular tachyarrhythmias (vta) and the response to therapeutic interventions
vary among the genetically defined subtypes of lqts.1,2
for example, most cardiac events in  xxxg1268xxx  patients are
associated with increased sympathetic activity and betablocker treatment is considered useful in preventing vta
in this group of patients.3,4 on the other hand, vta in the
 xxxg2028xxx  syndrome are bradycardia-dependent andbeta-adrenergic blocker therapy appears to have limited efficacy in this
population.4,5 however, in recent clinical studies, 30–35%
of vta in  xxxg2028xxx  patients occurred during exercise or emotional stress, suggesting an arrhythmogenetic role played
by increased sympathetic activity in  xxxg2028xxx  as well.3 although  xxxd2635xxx  causes a greater qt interval shortening
in  xxxg2028xxx  syndrome than in other subtypes of lqts,6,7 a
correlation between the degree of qt interval shortening
and the therapeutic effects of  xxxd2635xxx  has not been

established.
using an animal model of lqts, we focused on arrhythmogenesis in the period of heart rate acceleration induced
by a shift of autonomic activity from a parasympathetic to a
predominantly sympathetic state.8 our recent study in a
canine anthopleurin-a model of  xxxg2028xxx  showed that withdrawal of vagal stimulation produced gradual shortening of
the cardiac cycle and vta was sometimes induced during
the transition period of the cardiac cycle length.8 to further
study the arrhythmogenesis in the sympathetic activity
predominant period, the incidence and onset mode of vta
were analyzed before and after administration of  xxxd2635xxx  in a new experimental setting of the canine model of
 xxxg2028xxx . the therapeutic effect of  xxxd2635xxx  was assessed
by its effect on intramural repolarization and the inducibility of vta by modulation of vagal tone.

methods

the study was approved by the animal studies
subcommittee of the institutional review board, and
confirmed with the guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals published by the us national
institutes of health. experiments were performed in 7

sodium thiopental (17.5 mg/kg intravenous bolus, followed
by a maintenance dose of 5.0 mg·kg–1 ·h–1), intubated, and
artificially ventilated. catheters were inserted into the
femoral vein for administration of fluids and drugs, and
into the femoral artery to monitor blood pressure. leads i,
ii and avf of the surface electrocardiogram (ecg) and
blood pressure were continuously monitored. the heart
was exposed via a midline sternotomy. core temperature
was maintained constant at 37°c with a thermostatically
controlled thermal blanket. saline warmed to 37°c was
regularly applied to the heart to moisten and prevent
cooling of the epicardial surface. upon completion of the
experiment, ventricular fibrillation was induced electrically
under general anesthesia, and the heart was excised.
recording and pacing electrodes
four plunge needle electrodes were inserted in the basal
region of the lateral left ventricular wall, where experimental models have shown there is prominent m-cell-like
activity.8,9 each 21-gauge stainless steel needle had 8
polyamide-coated tungsten wire electrodes, 50mum in diameter, separated by 1 mm. the most proximal electrode was
located approximately 0.5 mm from the epicardial surface,
and unipolar electrograms across the left ventricular walls
from epicardial (epi), mid-myocardial (mid) and endocardial (endo) sites were recorded simultaneously. the most
proximal and distal plunge electrode sites were used as

representative epi and endo layers, respectively, and the
electrode in between, which recorded the longest activation – recovery interval (ari) at baseline, was representative of the mid layer. the ari was calculated as the interval between the time of minimum first derivative of the
intrinsic deflection of the qrs complex and the maximum
first derivative of the t wave of unipolar electrograms.10,11
previous studies in this experimental model have shown
that the ari from unipolar electrograms closely approximates the local effective refractory period regardless of the
t wave morphology.7,12
in the present study, the cardiac cycle length was lengthened by vagal stimulation, performed via a 75mum silver
wire inserted into the right cervical vagosympathetic
trunk.8,12 square pulses, 0.3 ms in duration and 0.5–1.0 v in
strength, were delivered at a frequency of 20 hz. the heart
was paced from bipolar silver wire electrodes inserted in
the right ventricle. pacing pulses 2.0 ms in duration were
delivered by a programmable cardiac stimulator at twice
the diastolic threshold.
data acquisition
in each experiment, 32 transmural unipolar electrograms
(8 electrodes × 4 needles) were amplified and filtered at a
fixed high-pass setting of 0.05 hz, and an adjustable lowpass setting of 500 hz. analog data were digitized at a sampling rate of 1,000 hz (f-tech co, ltd, niigata, japan). the
digitized signals were stored in a personal computer.8,9 the
ari was calculated from each unipolar electrogram, and
the ari dispersion of the ventricle was analyzed as transmural ari dispersion (arid), defined as the maximum
ari difference among 8 unipolar electrograms in each
needle electrode. because 4 needle electrodes were inserted
in each experiment, 28 data points (4 needles × 7 experiments) were available for statistical analysis of ari in each
layer of the ventricle and transmural arid.

study protocol and data analysis
the cardiac cycle length was initially increased by onset,
then gradually decreased by cessation of electrical vagal
stimulation. the vagal stimulation protocol (vsp) has
recently been described.8 in the present study, the vsp was
repeated 8 times before and 5 times after administration of
 xxxd2635xxx  in each experiment, and intramural repolarization and activation pattern and the initiation pattern of vta
during heart rate acceleration were analyzed. the ari and
transmural arid were compared before and after administration of  xxxd2635xxx  during ventricular pacing at a cycle
length of 1,000 ms.
statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed using student’s t-test,
fisher’s exact test and analysis of variance. a p<0.05 was
considered statistically significant. values are presented as
mean ± sd.

results
intramural repolarization pattern during a transition
period of heart rate acceleration
vagal stimulation induced a slow ventricular escape
rhythm (cycle length 800–1,500 ms) and prolonged ari at
all sites (fig 1a). a large transmural arid was created
during bradycardia because of greater ari prolongation at
mid than at epi/endo sites. after cessation of vagal stimulation, the cardiac cycle length gradually shortened to the
control level, but intramural unipolar electrograms started
to show ari alternans (fig 1b). during ari alternans, the
magnitude of ari oscillation was greater at mid sites,
which was associated with the development of a cycle-tocycle reversed gradient of ventricular transmural repolaricirculation journal vol.67, march 2003

initiation of vta
premature complexes developed during the transition period of heart rate acceleration (2.2±2.0 beats for each vsp,
range 0–10 beats), and vta were induced in 12 of 56 (21%)
attempts of the vsp (table 1). no vta was observed after
the heart rate had returned to the control level (136±
9 beats/min). furthermore, as reported previously,7,12 bradycardia-dependent spontaneous vta were also observed in
all 7 experiments during vagal stimulation, suggesting an
enhanced susceptibility to arrhythmias during this period.

alternans in the transition period of heart rate acceleration.
a single premature ventricular complex (pvc) infringes on
the large spatial dispersion of ventricular repolarization in a
cycle with a longer qt interval. activation of the pvc
shows delayed conduction at several mid sites and triggers
the vta. fig 3, obtained from a different experiment,
shows surface ecg leads i and ii, and selective transmural
left ventricular electrograms from 2 neighboring needle
electrodes. several pvcs occur after cessation of vagal
stimulation and the last one triggers a vta. the qrs
configuration and coupling interval of the pvcs are nearly
identical on the surface ecg. however, a longer cycle of
990 ms between the last 2 sinus events provides a longer
preceding diastolic interval for the last cycles. this longer
diastolic interval results in a prolonged ari of the last
sinus cycle, such that the last pvc, though its coupling
interval is identical to that of previous pvcs, creates new
delayed conduction at several mid/endo sites and initiates
vta.13 unipolar electrograms from 2 needle electrodes
show similar intramural activation and repolarization patterns, as the needle electrodes are inserted within a small
area of the left ventricular free wall.

antiarrhythmic effects of  xxxd2635xxx 
 xxxd2635xxx  markedly shortened ari at all sites (table 2,

mid/endo sites, though there was no significant difference
in ari among the 3 layers of the ventricle after drug
administration.  xxxd2635xxx  attenuated arid from 92±11 to
30±10 ms (p<0.0001) at the ventricular paced cycle length
of 1000 ms, which was caused by a greater shortening of
ari at mid/endo rather than epi sites (endo: –31.0±9.7%,
mid: –32.1±8.8%, epi: –24.0±8.5%, p=0.0019). systolic

from 123±14 to 112±10 mmhg and from 63±8 to 59±

rate was not different before (136±9 beats/min) versus after
(130±12 beats/min)  xxxd2635xxx .
after  xxxd2635xxx  administration, the vsp was performed
5 times in each experiment. neither ari alternans nor
vta was induced by any of the 35 attempts (12/56 times
before vs 0/35 times after  xxxd2635xxx , p<0.003) (table 1). a
similar change in heart rate was induced by vsp before and
after  xxxd2635xxx , but only a few premature beats were
observed during the transition period of heart rate acceleration after  xxxd2635xxx  (0.4±0.7 complexes in each vsp,
range 0–3 complexes).

discussion
heart rate acceleration by vsp
in previous studies, a faster heart rate associated with
sustained sympathetic stimulation decreased transmural
dispersion of ventricular repolarization and suppressed
vta in the  xxxg2028xxx  syndrome.14–16 however, abrupt increases
in sympathetic activity may have arrhythmogenic effects,9,17
because several episodes of vta in  xxxg2028xxx  syndrome have
been observed in association with exercise or emotional
stress, and becausebeta-adrenergic blockade has some protective effects.3,4 to further study the arrhythmogenic effects
of heightened sympathetic activity in  xxxg2028xxx  syndrome,
clinically relevant experimental conditions were created in
the present study by cessation of vagal stimulation such that
a state of predominant sympathetic activity was created.

it is well known that an abrupt shortening of the cardiac
cycle length by rapid pacing can induce repolarization
alternans in various experimental conditions.18,19 attention
has been focused on this phenomenon, which is believed to
amplify the underlying dispersion of repolarization and
represent a precursor of tachyarrhythmias.20,21 however, in
clinical cases, heart rate changes gradually depending on
autonomic activity. in the present study, transmural electrograms showed ari alternans during gradual shortening
of the cardiac cycle similar to that observed in rapid pacing
models,18,19,22 and a large spatial and temporal dispersion of
ventricular repolarization was created. different magnitudes of ari oscillations in each layer of the ventricle were
associated with the development of a large transmural
dispersion of ventricular repolarization,19,22 probably because of differences in restitution kinetics and the diastolic
intervals in each layer of the ventricle, resulting in a different restitution pattern within the same cardiac cycle.19,23 as
additional arrhythmogenic factors, abnormal automaticity
and/or delayed afterdepolarization, enhanced under conditions of predominantly sympathetic activity, seemed to
cause vta-triggering premature beats during heart rate
acceleration. our results suggest that, as during bradycardia,3,12 arrhythmogenesis in the  xxxg2028xxx  model is promoted
during the transition period of heart rate acceleration, and
suppressed by continued faster, control-level sinus cycle
length.
therapeutic effects of  xxxd2635xxx 
 xxxd2635xxx  causes a greater qt interval shortening in the
 xxxg2028xxx  than in the  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1246xxx  syndromes.6,7 though a
shortening of the qt interval may indicate a decreased
arrhythmogenic potential in the heart, the correlation between qt interval shortening and protection against vta
has not been firmly established. the vta of lqts are
usually not predictably reproduced by conventional protocols, including programmed electrical stimulation,beta-adrenergic stimulation and exercise, making comparisons of the
degree of inducibility before and after therapeutic interventions unreliable.24,25 however, in the present study, no vta
was induced by vsp after administration of  xxxd2635xxx , an
observation associated with ari shortening and attenuation of transmural arid. although the inducibility of vta
was not high before  xxxd2635xxx  (21%, 12/56 attempts of
vsp), it seems plausible that their complete suppression
after  xxxd2635xxx  was attributable to an antiarrhythmic effect
of the drug. a decrease in the number of premature beats
during heart rate acceleration was also associated with
vta suppression. previous experimental studies have
reported that  xxxd2635xxx  is effective in suppressing abnormal automatic activity of purkinje fibers.26 furthermore,
circulation journal vol.67, march 2003

arrhythmogenesis and sympathetic activity in  xxxg2028xxx 

 xxxd2635xxx  may counteract the effect of anthopleurin-a,
which increases the net inward current, and may explain
the decreased number of premature beats after its administration. although we used the same vsp in all experiments,
the number of premature beats and the process of heart rate
acceleration were not identical in each attempt, under the
same experimental conditions, or across the 7 experiments,
probably as a result of variable parasympathetic and sympathetic activity during each episode. the antiarrhythmic
effects of  xxxd2635xxx  may have involved, at least in part,
inhibition of sympathetic nerve traffic in the ventricle, but
the power of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity was
not evaluated in each attempt of the vsp, so the detailed
mechanism of the development of premature beats and its
modification by  xxxd2635xxx  were not entirely clarified by
this study.
clinical implications
in some patients with  xxxg2028xxx  syndrome, transient heart
rate acceleration caused by an abrupt shift to a state of predominant sympathetic activity increases the heterogeneous
distribution of ventricular repolarization and induces triggered premature beats, resulting in the initiation of vta.
therefore,beta-adrenergic blockade, which can modulate this
process of heart rate acceleration and suppress the premature beats, has the potential to be therapeutic in some  xxxg2028xxx 
patients. though it is important to assess the therapeutic
effects of beta-adrenergic blockade, unfortunately they were
not undertaken in this study.  xxxd2635xxx , which homogenizes the distribution of ventricular repolarization and
suppresses premature ventricular complexes, may have
additional antiarrhythmic effects against vta during
periods of heart rate acceleration.
study limitations
the distribution of m-cells is heterogeneous, such that
the limited recording electrodes and small recording area
may have underestimated the heterogeneity of ventricular
repolarization.25 furthermore, the steepest repolarization
gradients between the surface of the epicardium and the
deep subepicardium are difficult to resolve with unipolar
electrograms that begin at a depth of 0.5 mm, a technical
limitation that may also underestimate the transmural repolarization gradient.27
the effects of  xxxd2635xxx  were studied after a single dose.
different doses of  xxxd2635xxx  likely have different effects
on vta inducibility and transmural arid. the vsp
should be attempted 8 times after  xxxd2635xxx , but we only
measured it 5 times. several mutations have been reported
in the genes of lqts and the clinical characteristics of
lqts vary depending on each mutation.28 therefore,
experimental studies of drug efficacy using these models
are limited in their ability to test the clinical usefulness of
therapeutic interventions in all forms of lqts.
in the present study, we could not measure sympathetic
and vagal activity during the transition period of heart rate
acceleration. because heart rate acceleration itself may be
associated with arrhythmogenesis during this period.19,22 we
need to measure the alteration of autonomic tone in future
experiments. spectrum analysis of the body surface ecg
may provide some additional information of autonomic
activity during the heart rate acceleration period. moreover,
as well as beta-adrenergic stimulation, alpha-adrenergic activity
may act arrhythmogenically in the transition period of heart
rate acceleration. in congenital lqts patients, we recently

reported beneficial effects of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade.29
therefore, the effects of bothbeta- andalpha-adrenoceptor blockade on vta related to the vsp should be studied in future
experiments.
 xxxd2635xxx  appears to have a beneficial effect in  xxxg2028xxx 
patients, though its long-term efficacy has not been confirmed in clinical studies. finally, further studies in a larger
study population are required for a detailed analysis of the
arrhythmogenic potential of abrupt changes in autonomic
activity and the therapeutic effects of  xxxd2635xxx  in the
 xxxg2028xxx  syndrome.
