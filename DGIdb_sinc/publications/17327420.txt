the human nuclear  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ) responds to a wide variety of xenobiotic and endobiotic compounds, including pregnanes, progesterones, corticosterones, lithocholic acids, and 17␤estradiol. in response to these ligands, the
receptor controls the expression of genes central
to the metabolism and excretion of potentially
harmful chemicals from both exogenous and endogenous sources. although the structural basis of
 xxxg1598xxx ’s interaction with small and large xenobiotics
has been examined, the detailed nature of its binding to endobiotics, including steroid-like ligands,
remains unclear. we report the crystal structure of
the human  xxxg1598xxx  ligand-binding domain (lbd) in
complex with 17␤-estradiol, a representative steroid ligand, at 2.65 å resolution. estradiol is found
to occupy only one region of  xxxg1598xxx ’s expansive ligand-binding pocket, leaving a notable 1000 å3 of

space unoccupied, and to bridge between the key
polar residues ser-247 and arg-410 in the  xxxg1598xxx 
lbd. positioning the steroid scaffold in this way
allows it to make several direct contacts to ␣af of
the receptor’s af-2 region. the  xxxg1598xxx -estradiol
complex was compared with that of other nuclear
receptors, including the  xxxg730xxx , in complexes with analogous ligands. it was found that
 xxxg1598xxx ’s placement of the steroid is remarkably distinct relative to other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. using the  xxxg1598xxx -estradiol complex as a guide, the binding of other steroid- and
cholesterol-like molecules was then considered.
the results provide detailed insights into the manner in which human  xxxg1598xxx  responds to a wide range
of endobiotic compounds. (molecular endocrinology 21: 1028–1038, 2007)

t

in response to these and other chemicals,  xxxg1598xxx  regulates the expression of gene products involved in protective cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and processing.  xxxg1598xxx  is a member of the nuclear receptor (nr)
superfamily of ligand-regulated transcription factors
and, like most nrs, contains both dna-binding domains and ligand-binding domains (lbds) connected
by a presumably flexible hinge region (12).  xxxg1598xxx  functions as an obligate heterodimer with the retinoid x
receptor and binds to various combinations of direct
and everted repeat elements in the regulatory regions
of target genes (3). although it does not contain a
lengthy activation function 1 (af-1) region at its n
terminus like other nrs,  xxxg1598xxx  maintains an intact af-2
within its lbd, which is stabilized by bound ligand and
facilitates the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators (13). unlike many nrs, however,  xxxg1598xxx  exhibits a
consistent basal transcriptional activity in the absence
of ligand (4, 14).
crystal structures of the  xxxg1598xxx  lbd have been reported in its apo (unliganded) state, as well as with
small drug-like and herbal ligands (e.g.  xxxd1380xxx ,  xxxd2307xxx ) and the large macrolide ligand rifampicin (13–

he  xxxg1598xxx  [ xxxg1598xxx ; also known as
 xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ) and pregnane-activated receptor (par)] plays a central role in
xenobiotic detection and the subsequent regulation of
genes involved in drug metabolism and excretion (1–
4). the receptor has also been shown to respond to
key endogenous ligands, including 5-␤-pregnane3,20-dione, progesterones, corticosterones, testosterone, pregnenolones, lithocholic acids, the steroid-like
compound dexamethasone, and 17␤-estradiol (4–11).
indeed,  xxxg1598xxx  was termed the  xxxg1598xxx 
because it is activated by a variety of c21 steroids (4).

16). these structures have revealed that  xxxg1598xxx  contains
an expansive and structurally conformable ligandbinding pocket capable of changing in shape depending on the nature of its bound ligand.  xxxg1598xxx  also maintains an approximately 60-residue insert between ␣1
and ␣3 in the well-established lbd fold, which adds a
variety of distinct features to  xxxg1598xxx  including two
␤-strands that extend the standard two- to threestranded lbd ␤-sheet to five strands in  xxxg1598xxx  (17). the
terminal ␤-strands in these ␤-sheets interact in an
ideal antiparallel fashion in  xxxg1598xxx  to form a homodimer
unique to  xxxg1598xxx  that has recently been shown to be
critical for receptor function (18). it has also been
noted that the  xxxg1598xxx  lbd deviates significantly in sequence across species relatively to other nrs, and
these differences have led to the hypothesis that the
pxrs evolved to respond to xenobiotic or endobiotic
pressures distinct to each species (4, 19).
whereas the nature of  xxxg1598xxx ’s interactions with xenobiotics has been well examined structurally, no corresponding structural data exist to date on the interaction of  xxxg1598xxx  with an endogenous ligand, including
steroid-like compounds, which appear to be of predominant importance. to address this, we determined
the crystal structure of the  xxxg1598xxx  lbd in complex with
17␤-estradiol, a representative steroid, and refined it
to 2.65 å resolution. this structure reveals that  xxxg1598xxx 
positions estradiol in one hemisphere of its ligandbinding pocket, bridging key polar regions of the receptor and directly contacting the af-2 region. this
binding mode is distinct relative to both the interaction
of the  xxxg730xxx  (er) with the same ligand (20)
and the manner in which other nrs contact steroid- or
cholesterol-like ligands (21–26). in addition, the data
outlined in this paper support the hypothesis that
 xxxg1598xxx ’s evolution has been significantly impacted by
the ability to recognize the bile acids unique to different organisms and to play a protective role in eliminating toxic levels of such compounds. in summary,
this structure provides the first scaffold by which the
binding of endogenous ligands to  xxxg1598xxx  can be understood and probed at the molecular level.

results
overall structure
to unravel the structural basis of the recognition of
endogenous steroid-like ligands by the nuclear xenobiotic receptor  xxxg1598xxx , we determined the crystal structure of the  xxxg1598xxx  lbd in complex with 17␤-estradiol.
repeated attempts to obtain a structure of this complex were hampered by the covalent attachment of the
reducing agent dithiothreitol (dtt) to cys-284 within
the ligand-binding pocket of  xxxg1598xxx , as visualized within
several crystal structures (data not shown). thus, this
cysteine side chain was replaced with serine using
pcr mutagenesis, which produced a form of the lbd
that generated a stable complex with estradiol. crys-

tals were obtained, and data were collected to 2.65 å
resolution at the southeast regional collaborative access team beamline facility at advanced photon
source at argonne national labs (argonne, il). the
structure was determined by molecular replacement
and refined using torsion angle dynamics to rcryst and
rfree values of 0.217 and 0.273, respectively (table 1).
the  xxxg1598xxx  lbd conformation is similar to that observed
in other  xxxg1598xxx -ligand complexes determined to date
(13–16), exhibiting the three ␣-helical layers common
to nr lbds but with the unique  xxxg1598xxx  features of an
extended ␤-sheet mediating homodimer formation
(fig. 1a). the  xxxg1598xxx  lbd in the estradiol complex shares
0.5 å root-mean-square deviation in c␣ atom positions with the apo (unliganded)  xxxg1598xxx  structure (14) and
is in the active conformation with regard to its af-2
surface. only a few residues adjacent to the ligandbinding pocket exhibit small shifts in position between
the two structures, including ser-247 (60° rotation,
producing a ⬃1-å shift), cys-284-ser (60° rotation, ⬃2
å-shift), leu-411 (rotamer change for 2.5-å shift), met243 (rotamer change for 1.5-å shift), and arg-410 (1-å
shift). thus, the binding of estradiol to the  xxxg1598xxx  lbd
does not induce large structural changes relative to
the unliganded form of the receptor.
estradiol binding
the use of fobsligand ⫺ fobsapo, ␾calc maps to identify
clearly the positioning of ligands has been effective in
past  xxxg1598xxx -agonist complex structure determinations
(16). thus, we calculated an fobspxr-est ⫺ fobsapo,

contacts two residues, met-425 and phe-429 (labeled in red), located on ␣af of the  xxxg1598xxx  af-2 surface. the view in this figure is

the ligand and protein side chains are shown in cyan and purple for the estradiol and  xxxd1380xxx  complexes, respectively.

3␴ indicated the position of 17␤-estradiol bound
within the  xxxg1598xxx  ligand-binding pocket (fig. 1b). it was
particularly helpful to observe density for the extracyclic 18-methyl group, which allowed for unambiguous
placement of the ligand in a single orientation. estradiol refined with relatively high thermal displacement
parameters (⬃85 å2), although such values have been
observed with other ligands bound to  xxxg1598xxx  (e.g. rifampicin) (15). 17␤-estradiol forms hydrogen bonds with
two  xxxg1598xxx  side chains and additional interactions with
eight other residues. the 3-hydroxyl group on the
steroid a-ring forms a 2.7-å hydrogen bond with ser247, whereas the 17␤-hydroxyl group on the d-ring

forms a 2.9-å hydrogen bond with arg-410 (fig. 1c).
arg-410 is stabilized by a 2.9-å hydrogen bond with
ser-208, which itself is 3.5 å from the oxygen of the
ligand’s 17␤-hydroxyl group. arg-410 is further stabilized by a 3.0-å hydrogen bond with the side chain of
glu-321. the side chain of his-407 was placed in two
distinct orientations in this structure, and each orientation forms a 3.3-å van der waals contact with atoms
within the ligand. thus, polar interactions appear to
position the ligand within one region of the ligandbinding cavity, which leaves a significant portion of the
available room within the pocket unoccupied (fig. 1a).

ping and some distinct polar interactions (13) relative
to those formed by estradiol within the  xxxg1598xxx  ligandbinding pocket (fig. 1d). for example, both ligands
form hydrogen bonds with ser-247; however, whereas
estradiol forms polar contacts with ser-206 and arg410,  xxxd1380xxx  makes a hydrogen bond to his-407.
note that the two serines and his-407 adjust in position by up to 2.7 å (o␥-o␥ in ser-208) to create the
necessary hydrogen bonds with each ligand (fig. 1d).
nonpolar contacts also play a key role in stabilizing
17␤-estradiol within the ligand-binding pocket of  xxxg1598xxx .
phe-420 forms a 4.5-å edge-to-face contact normal to
the conjugated a-ring of the steroid, whereas the side
chain of phe-429 forms a second edge-to-face contact more parallel to the a-ring at a distance of 3.5 å
(fig. 1c). the a-ring is further stabilized by 3.4-å and
3.6-å van der waals contacts with leu-411 and met425, respectively, and by a 3.0-å interaction between
the ␲-orbitals of phe-251 and the 3-hydroxyl group of
the steroid. the b-ring of the steroid also forms a 3.4-å
van der waals contact with met-243. note that met425 and phe-429, which are directly contacted by
estradiol, are located on ␣af of the  xxxg1598xxx  af-2 surface;
thus, these interactions likely help to stabilize the active af-2 conformation of the receptor. the volume of
the human  xxxg1598xxx  ligand-binding pocket without estradiol present is 1376 å (3), as calculated by the method
of castp (27). in the presence of the ligand, however,
this volume only decreases by 395 å (3), leaving 981 å
(3) unoccupied by ligand.

wild-type (table 2). note that the cys-284-ser mutation employed to prevent the covalent attachment of
dtt during crystallization does not impact the function
of the receptor. in contrast to these mutations, the
replacement of ser-247, which also forms a hydrogen
bond with estradiol, with alanine significantly impacts
the ability of the receptor to respond to this representative steroid ligand (table 2 and fig. 2). the ec50
value for estradiol increases from 22 ␮m for wild-type
 xxxg1598xxx  to more than 100 ␮m for the ser-247-ala variant.
for rifampicin, which forms a hydrogen bond with
ser-247 but also forms three additional polar interactions (15), the corresponding ec50 value is not significantly altered (1.2 ␮m for wild-type vs. 0.56 ␮m for
ser-247-ala; table 2). this observation supports the
conclusion that a polar contact between ser-247 and
steroid-like endobiotics plays an important role in the
activation of gene expression by  xxxg1598xxx . the reason that
ser-247 is perhaps more critical than other polar residues in the  xxxg1598xxx -estradiol complex is explained by the
following observations. ser-247 is located in close
proximity to the af-2 surface of  xxxg1598xxx . for example, it
is 3.8 å and 4.8 å, respectively, from the side chains of
met-425 and phe-429, which are directly contacted by
estradiol. indeed, we found that the simultaneous replacement of both of these nonpolar residues with
alanine produces a form of the receptor that is completely unresponsive to ligands (table 2 and fig. 2).

 xxxg1598xxx  mutants

we next sought to compare structurally the binding
of estradiol by  xxxg1598xxx  in relation to the interaction of
this steroid hormone to its cognate receptor, the er,
another member of the nr superfamily. the crystal
structure of  xxxg1598xxx  in complex with 17␤-estradiol
shares 2.6-å root mean square deviation over c␣
positions with the structure of er␣ (20), and the two
lbds share 16% sequence identity. a superposition
of the lbds reveal that, whereas the overall folds of
the proteins are similar, the positions of the bound
ligands within the pockets are distinct (fig. 3). estradiol in  xxxg1598xxx  binds closely adjacent to ␣af and
leaves a portion of the large ligand-binding pocket in
this receptor unoccupied. in contrast, estradiol is
more centrally located in the er␣ pocket, is oriented
nearly perpendicular to that observed in the  xxxg1598xxx 
complex, and occupies all but approximately 56 å3
of the space in the central pocket. er␣ forms three
hydrogen bonding and 12 nonpolar contacts with
estradiol, whereas  xxxg1598xxx  forms only two hydrogen
bonds and eight van der waals interactions (table
3). the 3-hydroxyl group on the a-ring of the steroid
forms two hydrogen bonds in the er␣ complex, with
glu-353 and arg-394; in  xxxg1598xxx , these residues are
replaced with the hydrophobic residues met-250
and val-291, respectively (fig. 3). the a-ring is further contacted in er␣ by an edge-to-face interaction with phe-404, which is replaced by cys-301 in
 xxxg1598xxx . thus, contacts analogous to those observed

to examine the role that individual residues may play
in the activation of  xxxg1598xxx  by steroid-like compounds,
variant forms of the full-length receptor were generated that contain either single-site or double-site mutants. the activation of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the cytochrome p450–3a4 promoter
was examined in cv-1 cells upon treatment with increasing concentrations of the established  xxxg1598xxx  agonist rifampicin (13–15), or 17␤-estradiol (fig. 2 and
table 2). for rifampicin, concentrations between 10 nm
and 10 ␮m were examined. for the weaker agonist
estradiol, concentrations up to 100 ␮m were examined
for all receptors so that ec50 values could be calculated (table 2). wild-type  xxxg1598xxx  exhibited the moderate
basal activation levels commonly observed for  xxxg1598xxx 
(14) and ec50 values of 1.2 and 22 ␮m in response to
rifampicin and estradiol, respectively. the binding affinities of rifampicin and 17␤-estradiol to  xxxg1598xxx  were
measured by scintillation proximity assays to be 5.2
and 5 ␮m, respectively (data not shown). three singlesite mutations, ser-208-ala, cys-284-ser, and arg410-leu, produced moderate changes in basal activation levels for  xxxg1598xxx  [effects seen previously for  xxxg1598xxx 
mutations (14–16)], but little change in ec50 values for
the up-regulation of gene expression by the receptor
(table 2 and fig. 2). for these mutants, ec50 values for
 xxxg1598xxx  activation were 14–15 ␮m, relative to 22 ␮m for

possible in  xxxg1598xxx . er␣ forms a hydrogen bond between his-524 and the 17-hydroxyl group in estra-

diol; his-524 is replaced by arg-410 in  xxxg1598xxx , which
forms a similar interaction in the  xxxg1598xxx -estradiol complex. the d-ring is further contacted by met-421 in
er␣, which is equivalent to ser-208 in  xxxg1598xxx . in summary, only one of three hydrogen bonds formed by
er␣ with estradiol is conserved in  xxxg1598xxx , and only
three of 12 van der waals contacts are maintained
(table 3). indeed, key residues involved in  xxxg1598xxx ’s
contact with estradiol are replaced by significantly
different side chains in er␣ as well. for example,
the  xxxg1598xxx  residues ser-247, his-407, phe-420, phe429, and phe-251 are equivalent to alanine, glycine,
valine, and two leucine residues, respectively, that
do not form analogous contacts in er␣ (fig. 3; table
3). significantly, however, both complexes with estradiol reveal that direct contacts are formed between the ligand and amino acid side chains on the

for the ability of these agonists to facilitate gene
activation by the receptors.
insights into  xxxg1598xxx  activation by other
endogenous ligands
 xxxg1598xxx  is well established as both a xenobiotic and endobiotic sensor. endogenous ligands known to activate human  xxxg1598xxx -mediated gene expression include
pregnanes, progesterone, corticosterone, testosterone, lithocholic acids, and the steroid-like xenobiotic
dexamethasone (1, 4, 5, 7–9, 11). we next sought to
examine the basis of  xxxg1598xxx  activation by endogenous
compounds by using as a guide the  xxxg1598xxx -estradiol
structure, the first determined for a steroid scaffold

ligand in complex with this receptor. as summarized
above, estradiol bridges between two polar regions
within the  xxxg1598xxx  pocket, represented by ser-247 and
arg-410 (fig. 4a). arg-410 is also proximal to the surface of the receptor and to a series of other polar side
chains that are either adjacent to (e.g. ser-206 at 3.5 å)
or more distant from estradiol, such as arg-413, asp205, lys-204, and asp-230 (fig. 4a). using binding
modes analogous to estradiol as a guide, a series of
endogenous compounds that are known  xxxg1598xxx  activators were modeled into the receptor’s ligand-binding
pocket. significantly, all compounds capable of maintaining contacts to ser-247 and the arg-410 regions
were established  xxxg1598xxx  agonists. for example, 5-␤pregnane-3,20-dione, a ligand for which  xxxg1598xxx  (the
pregnane-x-receptor) is named (4), is capable of forming hydrogen bonds with both ser-247 and arg-410.
indeed, modeling this ligand into the  xxxg1598xxx  pocket using
the estradiol structure as a guide reveals that hydrogen bonds to both side chains are likely (fig. 4b).
additional ligands with 3-keto groups, regardless of
the conjugated state of their a-rings, also appeared
capable of receiving hydrogen bonds from ser-247
(fig. 4a). in the cases of corticosterone, cortisol, 3-keto-lithocholic acid, and 3-keto-7␣,12␣-dihydroxy-5␣cholanic acid, additional favorable contacts were also
likely. for example, the polar side chain of his-407
appeared ideally positioned to interact with hydroxyl
or keto oxygens at either the 11 or 12 positions on the
steroid scaffolds (see corticosterone, cortisol, and
3-keto-7␣,12␣-dihydroxy-5␣-cholanic acid in fig. 4a).
modeling 3-keto-lithocholic acid into the  xxxg1598xxx  pocket
using the estradiol binding mode as a guide reveals
expected hydrogen bonds to ser-247, arg-410, and
glu-321 (fig. 4c). in addition, extended side chains at
the 17 positions of the steroid are also observed to
make favorable contacts with polar residues adjacent
to arg-410, such as those shown for dexamethasonet-butylacetate and 3-keto-7␣,12␣-dihydroxy-5␣cholanic acid. 3␤-acetate moieties were also found to
be capable of forming polar interactions with ser-247,
which explains the activation of  xxxg1598xxx  by lithocholic
acid acetate and lithocholic acid acetate methyl ester
(fig. 4a). similarly, 3␤- and 3␣-hydroxyl groups appeared appropriately positioned to hydrogen bond to
ser-247, helping to explain the agonist character of

fig. 4.  xxxg1598xxx  ligand-binding pocket with modeled 3-ketolithocholic acid and 5-␤-pregnane-3,20-dione
a, analysis of the potential interactions between  xxxg1598xxx  and
other endogenous ligands (as well as dexamethasone) predicted by the  xxxg1598xxx -estradiol complex reported here. a schematic view of the proximity of key side chains adjacent to
estradiol is shown at top (s247, r410, s208), along with
several residues near the 17-oh moiety. known  xxxg1598xxx  agonists with 3-keto, 3-␤-acetate, 3-␤-hydroxy, and 3-␣-hydroxy
groups are all predicted to form favorable interactions with
s247; as shown, further favorable interactions may be formed
with additional  xxxg1598xxx  residues, including h407, r413,  xxxd205xxx ,
and k204. b, the endogenous  xxxg1598xxx  activator 5-␤-pregnane3,20-dione (magenta), modeled into the  xxxg1598xxx  ligand-binding
pocket (red) using  xxxg1598xxx -estradiol complex as a guide and
viewed in the roughly same orientation as fig. 3, may form
polar interactions with ser-247 and arg-410. c, the endogenous  xxxg1598xxx  activator 3-keto-lithocholic acid (cyan), modeled
into the  xxxg1598xxx  ligand-binding pocket (red) using  xxxg1598xxx -estradiol
complex as a guide and viewed in the roughly same orientation as fig. 3, may form polar interactions with ser-247,
glu-321, and arg-410.

pregnenolones and dehydroepiandrosterone (fig. 4a).
certain bile acids identified as activators of human
 xxxg1598xxx  were also found to be capable of spanning the
distance between ser-247 and the polar residues adjacent to arg-410, including glycolithocholic acid and
taurolithocholic acid. taken together, the data presented here provide a structural framework in which
endogenous, steroid-like molecules may be understood at the molecular level to be ligands for human
 xxxg1598xxx .

the human  xxxg1598xxx  lbd, which has been shown to
respond to a variety of both endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, shares structural similarity with
the nr superfamily lbds (28), including that of er.
however, in this report, we show that  xxxg1598xxx  binds to
er’s endogenous ligand, 17␤-estradiol, in a manner
markedly distinct from the  xxxg730xxx . although estradiol fills the ligand-binding pocket of
er, it binds adjacent to the ␣af of the af-2 region
in  xxxg1598xxx , leaving a significant portion of  xxxg1598xxx ’s large
binding pocket unoccupied. several structural features within each receptor lead to this difference in
binding orientation. the central ␤-strand (␤2) in er’s
three-stranded ␤-sheet dips deeper into the ligandbinding pocket in this receptor relative to  xxxg1598xxx , and
positions phe-404 such that it can form an edge-toface contact with the bound estradiol molecule (20).
er also contains a longer ␣6 and no equivalent to
the ␣2- and ␤1/ ␤1⬘-secondary structural elements
of  xxxg1598xxx ; together, these features allow er to place a
large number of side chains snugly within the ligandbinding pocket to contact estradiol. in addition, although  xxxg1598xxx ’s pocket is more expansive than that of
er, key estradiol-contacting residues in er are replaced in  xxxg1598xxx . for example, glu-353 and arg-394 of
er correspond to met-250 and val-291 in  xxxg1598xxx ,
respectively, neither of which is capable of forming
central polar contacts to the steroid ligand. phe-288
and his-407 in  xxxg1598xxx , which replace leu-391 and
gly-521 in er, respectively, would also clash at
approximately 1 å from estradiol bound as it is
observed in er␣. taken together, these observations indicate that key structural differences in the
lbd folds of er and  xxxg1598xxx  allow these two nrs to
bind 17␤-estradiol in remarkably distinct manners,
revealing the plasticity present in the common nr
fold.
several other nrs bind to steroid-like ligands,
including the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr), the liver
x receptor (lxr), and the constitutive androstane
receptor (car). we compared the  xxxg1598xxx -estradiol
complex structure with those of gr-dexamethasone
(21), lxr-25-epoxycholesterol (25), and car-5␤pregnane-3,20-dione (26) (fig. 5). similar to erestradiol, the gr and lxr complexes reveal that the
steroid ligand is bound nearly perpendicular to that
observed in  xxxg1598xxx . the contacts leading to these
binding modes are similar to that described above
for er␣, including the packing of several side chains
into the ligand-binding pockets of gr and lxr to
generate receptor-ligand interactions. recall that
gr and lxr are both highly specific for steroid-like
ligands, whereas  xxxg1598xxx  exhibits a much broader ligand-binding profile. car, another receptor that responds somewhat promiscuously to ligands, including estradiol (45), positions 5␤-pregnane-3,20-dione
in a manner similar to the placement of estradiol in

fig. 5. superpositions of the  xxxg1598xxx -estradiol structure on
that of the gr-dexamethasone (dex) complex (top), the
lxr-25-epoxycholesterol (echol) complex (middle), and the
car-5␤-pregnane-3,20-dione (pregnane) complex (bottom)
the view is the same as that shown in fig. 3 and focusing
on the ligand-binding pockets of the receptors.

 xxxg1598xxx . however, in car, 5␤-pregnane-3,20-dione
does not directly contact ␣af of the receptor’s af-2
domain; instead, asn-165 and tyr-326, which interact with the ligand, mediate contacts to ␣af (26). in
 xxxg1598xxx , these residues are replaced by ser-247 and
his-407, respectively, which form both key interactions with estradiol and also facilitate the positioning

mol endocrinol, may 2007, 21(5):1028–1038 1035

of the ligand in direct contact with ␣af. the  xxxg1597xxx  (fxr), which responds to bile acids,
was shown previously to orient 6-ethyl-chenodeoxylchlolic acid similar to that observed for dexamethasone-bound gr, with the distinction that the
a-ring faces the opposite direction in fxr (22).
again, this position is distinct relative to the observed estradiol docking adjacent to ␣af in the  xxxg1598xxx 
complex presented here; indeed, the position of the
loop after ␣1 in  xxxg1598xxx , which deviates by up to 9 å
relative to the same region in fxr, makes the analogous interaction of bile acids to  xxxg1598xxx  impossible
(data not shown). taken together, these observations highlight the largely distinct nature of  xxxg1598xxx ’s
interaction with steroid-like ligands relative to other
members of the nr superfamily.
it has been proposed that bile acids played a key
role in driving the evolution of the pxrs in a variety
of organisms (8). indeed,  xxxg1598xxx  has been shown to
respond to toxic levels of bile acids and to coordinate the expression of protective gene products
capable of metabolizing and excreting bile acids
that may accumulate in hepatocytes (5, 29–38).
schuetz and colleagues (8) recently examined the
activation by bile acids of a wide variety of pxrs and
 xxxg1598xxx -like receptors, including those from human,
mouse, rat, dog, cow, pig, rhesus, rabbit, chicken,
the zebrafish  xxxg1598xxx , and xenopus benzoate receptor.
they concluded that, in terms of responses to endogenous bile acids present in each organism, the
receptors could be grouped in the following fashion:
human; dog, pig, rhesus (and, likely, cow); mouse
and rat; rabbit; chicken x receptor; benzoate x receptor; zebrafish  xxxg1598xxx . using the human  xxxg1598xxx -estradiol complex as a guide, we examined the conservation of key residues in the human  xxxg1598xxx  ligand
binding across these orthologous receptors (table
4). we found that as the receptors deviate in their
responses to distinct bile acids, the conservation of
central residues within the binding pocket clearly
diminishes. thus, our structural data support the
conclusion that differences in the nature of endogenous bile acids may have played a significant role
in the evolution of the pxrs and  xxxg1598xxx -like receptors
in a wide variety of organisms.
in summary, the data presented here reveal that
 xxxg1598xxx  interacts with the steroid-like molecules by positioning them such that they contact ser-247, arg410, and ␣af of the receptor’s af-2 surface. as
noted in fig. 2,  xxxg1598xxx  has a relatively robust basal
activation level, which is then significantly enhanced
in the presence of ligands. the binding of a ligand
like estradiol with a moderate ec50 in close proximity to the af-2 surface likely allows  xxxg1598xxx  to enhance
transcriptional activation without the need for high
ligand binding affinity. the placement of steroidscaffold in  xxxg1598xxx  is distinct relative to other nr-steroid interactions, including that of gr, lxr, and the
car receptor, which shares some overlapping biological functions with  xxxg1598xxx . this structure provides a

roles probed both in vitro and in vivo.

materials and methods
protein expression and purification
the  xxxg1598xxx  lbd expression construct was engineered as an
n-terminal  xxxd2282xxx -tagged fusion protein with residues
130–434 from the human  xxxg1598xxx . the fusion insert was subcloned into the prseta expression vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). cys-284 within the  xxxg1598xxx  ligand-binding pocket was
mutated to serine, to prevent oxidation with dtt during crystallization, using the quikchange site-directed mutagenesis
kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. the mutant was confirmed by sequence analysis. residues 623–710 of the human  xxxg1510xxx ( xxxg1510xxx ) gene were subcloned into the bacterial vector pacyc184 along with a t7 promoter (39). the  xxxg1598xxx  lbd/
prseta and the  xxxg1510xxx /pacyc184 plasmids were
cotransformed into the bl21(de3) strain of escherichia coli.
shake flask liquid cultures (10 liters) containing standard
luria-bertani (lb) broth with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.034
mg/ml chloramphenicol were inoculated and grown at 22 c
for 20 h. the cells were harvested by centrifugation (20 min,
3500 ⫻ g, 4 c), and the cell pellet was stored at ⫺80 c. the
cell pellet was resuspended in 100 ml buffer a (50 mm tris-cl,
ph 7.8; 250 mm nacl; 50 mm imidazole, ph 7.5; 5% glycerol).
cells were sonicated for 3–5 min on ice, and the cell debris
was removed by centrifugation (90 min, 20,000 ⫻ g, 4 c). the
cleared supernatant was loaded on to a 50-ml probond nickel-chelating resin (invitrogen). after washing to baseline with
buffer a, the column was washed with buffer b containing 75
mm imidazole (ph 7.5) and buffer c containing 75 mm imidazole (ph 7.5) and 50 mm nacl. the  xxxg1598xxx  lbd/ xxxg1510xxx  complex
was eluted from the column using buffer d with 250 mm
imidazole (ph 7.5) and nacl 50 mm. column fractions were
pooled and subjected to sp cation exchange column (biorad laboratories, inc., hercules, ca) preequilibrated with
buffer containing 20 mm tris-cl (ph 7.8), 50 mm nacl, 5 mm

dtt, 2.5 mm edta (ph 8.0), 5% glycerol. the column was
washed to baseline with the same buffer and fractions containing the  xxxg1598xxx / xxxg1510xxx  complex were eluted at 400 mm nacl
and pooled and diluted 2-fold with the dilution buffer (20 mm
tris-cl, ph 7.8; 5 mm dtt; 2.5 mm edta, ph 8.0; 5% glycerol). the protein was concentrated using centri-prep 30k
(millipore corp., billerica, ma) units.
crystallization
the human  xxxg1598xxx  lbd/ xxxg1510xxx  complex (hpxr-lbd/ xxxg1510xxx )
was concentrated in the presence of 100-fold molar excesses of 17␤-estradiol to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml.
crystallization was achieved by hanging-drop vapor diffusion
against the following conditions at 22 c: 50 mm imidazole at
ph 7.1, 10%  xxxd2400xxx , (vol/vol).
data collection and structure determination
the structure of the estradiol-bound form of the lbd of
human  xxxg1598xxx  was determined by molecular replacement using
the crystal structure of the apo (unliganded)  xxxg1598xxx  as a search
model (14). rotation and translation function searches were
performed using amore (40); clear solutions for each were
obtained in the proper space group, p43212. the structure
was refined using the torsion angle protocol in crystallography and nmr system with the maximum likelihood function
as a target and included an overall anisotropic b-factor and
a bulk solvent correction (41). of the observed data, 10%
were set aside for cross-validation using the free-r statistic
before any structural refinement (42). manual adjustments
and rebuilding of the model were performed using o (43) and
␴a-weighted electron density maps (44). the structure exhibits good geometry (table 1) with no ramachandran
outliers.
transient transfections
mutant forms of full-length  xxxg1598xxx  were generated using the
quikchange mutagenesis kit (stratagene) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. all mutants were confirmed by
sequence analysis. transient transfection and reporter gene
assays were performed as described previously (14–16).

cv-1 cells were plated in 96-well plates in phenol red-free
dmem containing high glucose and supplemented with 10%
charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (hyclone laboratories, inc., logan, ut). transfection mixes contained 5 ng
of receptor expression vector, 20 ng of reporter plasmid, 12
ng of ␤-actin secreted  xxxg149xxx  as
internal control, and 43 ng of carrier plasmid. plasmids for
wild-type and mutant forms of human  xxxg1598xxx  and for the xremcyp3a4-luc reporter, containing the enhancer and promoter of the cyp3a4 gene driving luciferase expression,
were as previously described (14–16). transfections were
performed with lipofectamine (life technologies, inc.,
gaithersburg, md) essentially according to the manufacturer’s instructions. drug dilutions of estradiol (sigma, st. louis,
mo) and  xxxd1380xxx  (synthesized in-house) were prepared in
phenol red-free dmem/f-12 medium with 15 mm hepes
supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped, delipidated calf
serum (sigma, st. louis, mo) which had previously been heat
inactivated at 62 c for 35 min. serial drug dilutions were
performed in triplicate to generate 11-point concentration
response curves. cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of drugs, after which the medium was sampled and
assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity. luciferase reporter
activity was measured using the luclite assay system (packard instrument co., meriden, ct) and normalized to alkaline
phosphatase activity. ec50 values were determined by standard methods.
