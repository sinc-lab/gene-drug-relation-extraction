pharmacological and genetic manipulations of the renin-angiotensin system (ras) have been
found to alter the voluntary consumption of alcohol. here
we characterize the role of central  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii)
in alcohol intake first by using transgenic rats that express
an antisense rna against  xxxg99xxx  and consequently have reduced ang ii levels exclusively in the
central nervous system [tgr(asraogen)680]. these
rats consumed markedly less alcohol in comparison to
their wild-type controls. second,  xxxd3237xxx , an inhibitor of
the  xxxg36xxx  (ace), which passes
the blood-brain barrier, did not influence the alcohol
consumption in the tgr(asraogen)680, but it significantly reduced alcohol intake in wild-type rats. studies in
knockout mice indicated that the central effect of ang ii
on alcohol consumption is mediated by the angiotensin
receptor at1 whereas the  xxxg101xxx  receptor and the  xxxg258xxx  are not involved. furthermore, the dopamine concentration in the ventral tegmental area (vta) is
markedly reduced in rats with low central ang ii, strengthening our hypothesis of a role of dopaminergic transmission in ang ii-controlled alcohol preference. our results
indicate that a distinct drug-mediated control of the
central ras could be a promising therapy for alcohol
disease.—maul, b., krause, w., pankow, k., becker, m.,

within the renin angiotensin system (ras), the
inactive decapeptide  xxxg99xxx  (ang i) is cleaved
from its precursor molecule  xxxg99xxx  by the
enzyme renin. it is further degraded by the  xxxg36xxx  (ace), forming the active octapeptide  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii). ang ii interacts with
its specific angiotensin receptors (at1 and  xxxg101xxx ) and
regulates not only fundamental cardiovascular and
renal parameters but also initiates motivational
changes and learning processes (1–3).
interactions between the ras and the endogenous
reward system have frequently been discussed, espe1474

cially in terms of alcohol intake and dependency. the
ras-related actions on alcohol intake were found to be
mainly related to ang ii, but despite intense research
(4 –7) the results remained contradictory and pharmacological interventions often failed.
we recently found that voluntary alcohol consumption
is directly connected to ang ii generation (8). mice
harboring an  xxxg99xxx  transgene of the rat consumed significantly more alcohol than their wild-type
littermates. this effect was blunted by the ace inhibitor
 xxxd3237xxx . accordingly, mice lacking the  xxxg99xxx 
gene exhibited a lower alcohol intake (8). these results
indicated a role for the  xxxg99xxx  gene in alcohol
consumption via modulation of endogenous ang ii levels.
however, these experiments left open whether specifically
central or peripheral ang ii triggered these effects and
which subtypes of the participating receptors and downstream signaling pathways are involved. we have attempted to solve these problems using genetically modified animals. we used several receptor-deficient mice as
well as transgenic rats that expressed an angiotensinogenspecific antisense rna in the central nervous system
(cns). consequently, these rats exhibited a ⬎90% reduced  xxxg99xxx  level in the brain, resulting in a
reduction of the central ang ii formation. these animal
models thus enabled the certain description of the role of
central ang ii in the modulation of alcohol consumption.
moreover, studies with the knockout and transgenic animals provided clear insight into participating receptors
and definite hints on downstream signal transduction
processes.

german federal government and were approved by the local
authorities. transgenic rats expressing an antisense rna
against  xxxg99xxx  mrna specifically in the brain
[tgr(asraogen)680] (9) were obtained from breeding
stocks of m.b. at the max delbrück center for molecular
medicine (mdc) in berlin, germany. angiotensin receptor
at1a knockout mice (10) and  xxxg101xxx  knockout mice (11) were
obtained from breeding stocks of t.w. at the campus benjamin franklin (cbf) in berlin, germany.
 xxxg258xxx -deficient mice of a mixed genetic
background (j129sv(/ev) ⫻ c57bl/6j) (12) were purchased
from jackson-laboratories (jacksonville, fl usa). a genetic
backcross to a c57bl/6j background was performed over
seven generations before animals were used in experimentation. during backcross breeding, the genotype of the animals
was checked by pcr according to a specific protocol.
preference tests
animals were housed in groups of two per cage but separated
by a transparent plastic divider with several holes. this setting
allowed the animals to have social contact. however, they
were prevented from inflicting bodily harm on each other in
ranking fights. animals were housed at 22 ⫾ 1°c in a 12 h/12
h light/dark cycle with food and beverage available ad
libitum. all animals were habituated to drink from two tap
water bottles for 2 wk. eventually they were constantly given
the free choice between a bottle of tap water and a bottle with
a solution of either sucrose, saccharin, quinine, or alcohol.
the influence of the ace inhibitor  xxxd3237xxx  (awd, dresden,
germany) was tested by adding an individually adjusted
amount to the drinking water (5 mg/kg body weight/day).
the intake of water and alcoholic solution was recorded
separately for each animal every 24 h. bottle positions were
changed every day. water, alcoholic, and  xxxd3237xxx  solutions
were renewed every second day.
peptidase activities
after 3 wk of treatment with 5 mg  xxxd3237xxx  per kilogram body
weight, animals were killed by decapitation. the brains were
rapidly removed and stored until use at – 80°c. homogenates
were prepared in a 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx , ph 7.4, using a
glass-teflon potter at 4°c, filtered through nylon gauze, and
stored until use at – 80°c. ace activity was measured using
hippuryl-histidyl-leucine as substrate and histidyl-leucine as
standard reagent with a fluorimetric method as described by
maul et al. (8). specificity controls were carried out with 10⫺6
m of the specific ace inhibitor lisinopril (sigma-aldrich,
taufkirchen, germany). the total protein contents of the
homogenates were determined by a bradford assay (13).
nep activities were measured in the homogenates
using [d-ala2,  xxxg2329xxx ]enkephalin (dalek) (sigma-aldrich,
taufkirchen, germany) as substrate. the degradation was
monitored by hplc as described by winkler et al. (14). to
control the specificity of the reaction, we carried out
experiments under specific nep suppression with 10⫺6 m
 xxxd420xxx  (pfizer, kent, uk).
catecholamine measurements
brains were quickly removed and dissected on chilled petri
dishes according to popov et al. (15). each of the dissected
regions was added to 0.5 ml of cold perchloric acid (0.4 m).
after homogenization in a glass-teflon potter, samples were
centrifuged at 20,000 ⫻ g for 10 min. supernatants were
analyzed for catecholamines, especially dopamine and its
metabolite 3.4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac), by
angiotensin and alcohol

hplc (125 mm⫻3 mm i.d. column, packed with nucleosil
100 c 18; 3 ␮m particle size) and electrochemical detection
(intro, antec leyden, the netherlands; cell potential⫽800 mv). the mobile phase consisted of 5% acetonitril,
10 g/l  xxxd1710xxx , 4 g/l kh2po4 , 0,1 g/l edta, and
0,175 g/l octanesulfonic acid; ph ⫽ 3.0. all values in means

 xxxg2276xxx  activity
 xxxg2276xxx  (th) activity was detected by measuring
the production of 3,4- xxxd2471xxx  (dopa) from
l-tyrosine. brain regions (obtained as described above) were
homogenized in a 30-fold volume of phosphate buffer (10
mm, ph 6.0). 50 ␮l of homogenate were added to 50 ␮l
incubation mixture containing 100 mm phosphate buffer
(ph 6.0), 0.6 mm tyrosine, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 3.75 mm
3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (inhibitor of  xxxg618xxx ), and 0.6 mg/ml catalase. the reaction was started by
addition of 50 ␮l 3 mm 6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine
(cofactor). after 30 min of incubation at 37°c the reaction
was terminated by adding of 50 ␮l perchloric acid (0.8 m)
and 1 ␮m ␣-methyl-dopa as internal standard. after centrifugation the supernatant was added to a mixture of 20 mg
al2o3, 500 ␮l tris (3.0 m, ph 8.6) and edta (0.15 m) to
adsorb the catecholamines to al2o3. after stirring the mixture for 10 min, it was washed twice with 1 ml distilled water.
then the catecholamines were desorbed from al2o3 by
adding 200 ␮l of perchloric acid (0.4 m). the amount of
formed dopa was analyzed by hplc with electrochemical
detection (as described above) and corrected by the recovery
rate of ␣-methyl-dopa.

results
to further clarify the role of central ang ii in alcohol
consumption, we first tested the correlation between
endogenous ang ii in the cns and voluntary alcohol
intake in transgenic rats, which express an  xxxg99xxx -specific antisense rna specifically in the
brain [tgr(asraogen)680] (9, 16) and in their
wild-type controls (each n⫽8). wild-type rats were
sprague dawley animals of the same age, the strain in
which the transgenics have been generated. both
groups of rats are bred in the same unit of the animal
house.
at alcohol concentrations of 10% or higher, the
animals increasingly avoided the alcoholic solution. at
concentrations of 5% or less, the rats did not distinguish the alcoholic solution from water (data not
shown). thus we performed two-bottle, free choice
experiments with permanent access to 7.5% alcohol
and tap water. in this experimental design, wild-type
rats consumed 2.57 ⫾ 0.17 and tgr(asraogen)680
rat 1.84 ⫾ 0.18 g per kg body weight per day (mean
values for each of 16 animals over 10 consecutive days).
tgr(asraogen)680 rats drank significantly less
alcohol solution than wild-type controls in all sessions.
the preference ratio, expressed as proportion of ethanolic solution per total fluid consumption, of four
consecutive drinking sessions with 7.5% alcohol and
tap water in a two-bottle, free-choice experiment, is
summarized in fig. 1. the total fluid consumption of

the transgene rats was slightly elevated. this is due to a
very moderate and age-dependent form of a diabetes
insipidus-like syndrome with slightly elevated fluid intake, up to finally 25% elevation in the second half of
life (9). in the first period without any treatment
tgr(asraogen)680 rats consumed 85.2 ⫾ 4.5, and
wild-type controls 82.9 ⫾ 3.5 g beverages /kg body
weight.
to test whether the tgr(asraogen)680 would
exhibit a generally altered affinity to any fluid other
than water, we assayed their intake of sweet and bitter
tastants in three different free choice paradigms. in a
first experiment, tgr(asraogen)680 (n⫽8) and
wild-type controls (n⫽8) were given the choice between
tap water and 1.70% (w/v), followed by 4.25% sucrose
in tap water over a period of 4 days. tgr(asraogen)680 were indistinguishable from controls in
their preference for the sucrose solutions (fig. 2a).
these findings make it unlikely that the altered alcohol
consumption in tgr(asraogen)680 was calorie
driven. we also did not find significant differences
between tgr(asraogen)680 (n⫽8) and their wildtype controls (n⫽8) in the preference to water sweetened with saccharin (0.033% or 0.066% w/v) (fig. 2b).
when offered quinine-embittered solutions (0.03 and
0.10 mm) vs. tap water, animals did not distinguish the
smaller concentration, but both groups of animals
equally avoided drinking from the bottle with 0.10 mm
quinine (fig. 2c).
 xxxd3237xxx , a lipophilic nonpeptidic substance (17),
has been found to be an orally effective inhibitor of
ace activity in mice after application via feeding needles (8, 18). the substance reduces peripheral as well as
central ace activity and leads to a decrease in ang ii
concentration. we applied  xxxd3237xxx  (5 mg/kg body
weight/day) via the drinking water, a procedure not

parison of the alcohol intake ratio in tgr(asraogen)680 (fig. 4b) with that of wild-type rats under
 xxxd3237xxx  treatment (fig. 4a) demonstrates that the
ace inhibitor could not reduce the intake in wild-type
animals to the level of the transgenic rats.
 xxxd3237xxx  may act via decreasing the level of ang ii or
increasing the level of bradykinin. to clarify the mechanism of  xxxd3237xxx -mediated reduction of voluntary
alcohol intake, we tested the alcohol preference ratio in
mice lacking the receptors for these peptides—at1a,
 xxxg101xxx , and b2—and their corresponding wild-type littermates in a two-bottle, free choice paradigm using 10%
alcohol in tap water. exclusively, the ablation of at1a
receptors significantly reduced the alcohol intake (fig.
5a); the deficiencies in  xxxg101xxx  or b2 receptors were
without any effect (fig. 5b, c).
the reduced availability of central ang ii in
tgr(asraogen)680 and the known influence of this
peptide on the central dopamine system (for a review,
see ref 19) prompted us to test catecholamine levels in
brain areas important for reward. by hplc and electrochemical detection, we found a significantly lower
level of dopamine and its main metabolite dopac in
the brain region tegmentum/colliculi, which includes
the ventral tegmental area (vta), of tgr(asraogen)680 rats compared with wild-type littermates
(fig. 6a, b). the levels of dopamine and dopac were
not significantly different in other regions of the two
groups of rats (data not shown). furthermore, we
measured the activity of th, a key enzyme of the
dopamine synthesis. differences as described for the
dopamine or dopac levels were not found for the
th in the investigated regions of the cns. we

discussion
besides well-known social aspects, genetic factors play a
crucial role in individual alcohol consumption and the
pathogenesis of alcohol addiction. as a result of intensive research, more and more of these inheritable
factors have become known. in recent years remarkable
progress has been made by using genetically altered
animals, and the relevance of several receptors, neu-

ropeptidases, and neuropeptides for alcohol intake has
been discovered (20 –23).
although the involvement of the ras in alcoholconsuming behavior had been suggested (4 –7), the
specific function of its main peptide, ang ii, remained
unclear. we recently demonstrated a direct correlation
between endogenous ang ii levels and voluntary alcohol intake in genetically altered mice (8). alcohol
consumption in tgm123 mice, which show elevated
ang ii levels resulting from additional expression of an
 xxxg99xxx  transgene (24), was significantly increased. on the other hand, the alcohol preference
ratio in tlm mice lacking the  xxxg99xxx  gene
was less than that in their wild-type littermates. in spite
of an excessive total fluid consumption due to disturbances in fluid homeostasis (10), these tlm mice
drank even less alcohol than the controls (8). moreover, it has been found that the ace inhibitor  xxxd3237xxx 
(17), known to cross the blood-brain barrier of mice (8,
18) and consequently lower the ang ii levels in brain
and blood circulation, suppressed alcohol intake in
animals with elevated ang ii levels (tgm123) (8).
however, all these experiments could not distinguish
between the peripheral and central effects of ang ii.
nevertheless, our own observation in tgm123 mice on
increased alcohol consumption agrees with former
findings of fitts (6), who described an increased alcohol intake upon intracerebroventricular infusion of
ang ii in rats. fitts hypothesized on the importance of
central ang ii for alcohol intake. although assaying
directly the contribution of central ang ii to alcohol
consumption (6), these experiments are based on
invasive techniques with unpredictable effects on drinking behavior (25–27). moreover, the question whether
peripheral ang ii also contributes to alcohol consumption was still elusive.
tgr(asraogen)680 is a transgenic rat that expresses an antisense rna targeted against the 5⬘ region
of  xxxg99xxx  mrna under the control of the
glial cell specific fibrillary acidic protein promoter (9).
this leads to strongly reduced  xxxg99xxx  levels
in all regions of the brain (⬍⬍10%), whereas all
peripheral components of the ras were found to be
completely unaffected (9, 28, 29). these rats represent
a unique model to study the effects of central ang ii
without any surgical interventions (9), thereby avoiding
all external, perturbing influences, e.g., on voluntary
alcohol consumption. in this model, we identified a key
role of central ang ii in alcohol drinking behavior
applying two-bottle, free choice experiments, and finally discriminated it from a possible influence of
peripheral ang ii alterations. the difference between
genetically altered rats and wild-type controls shown in
fig. 1 is not due to the known ang ii-induced strengthened thirst and increases in total fluid consumption. in
spite of their slightly increased total fluid consumption
(9; this study), tgr(asraogen)680 drank even substantially less alcohol than the controls. because the
genetically altered rats otherwise display normal behav1478

ior, we conclude that they selectively avoid ingesting
the alcoholic beverage.
we proposed that suppression of ang ii formation
and consequently its downstream interactions with the
receptors at1 and/or  xxxg101xxx  is the mechanism that
triggers the alterations in alcohol drinking behavior
(8). to define the receptor responsible for the ace
inhibitor-mediated effects, we used mice lacking genes
for the at1a or  xxxg101xxx  receptors. while loss of the at1a
receptor significantly reduced alcohol intake, loss of
 xxxg101xxx  did not lead to substantial differences in alcohol
consumption in mice. obviously, the effects of central
ang ii on voluntary alcohol consumption are mediated
exclusively by the  xxxg100xxx .
oral application of the ace inhibitor  xxxd3237xxx  resulted in a reduction of alcohol consumption in wildtype rats. the ace activity in their brain homogenates
was reduced by about one-third. a similar decrease was
observed in mice (8, 18). takai et al. (18) showed that
 xxxd3237xxx  also leads to changes in other behavioral
parameters. they found that  xxxd3237xxx -treated animals
have an increased pain sensitivity (18). this study
unequivocally showed that the mentioned effect was
triggered exclusively by central ang ii, as the observed
alterations in hot plate latency did not occur in mice
treated with enalapril or captopril. these ace inhibitors do not cross the blood-brain barrier. accordingly,
we conclude that  xxxd3237xxx  in our experiments leads to
a reduction of alcohol consumption by inhibiting formation of central ang ii.
in contrast to the wild-types,  xxxd3237xxx  did not reduce
the alcohol consumption of tgr(asraogen)680.
this affirms in two ways the exclusive importance of
central ang ii on alcohol consumption. 1) the already
low level of central ang ii in these transgenic animals
(⬍⬍10% of wild-types) is possibly further limited by
 xxxd3237xxx  treatment, but this obviously cannot further veritably reduce the small alcohol intake in
tgr(asraogen)680. 2) the peripheral ace is unequivocally inhibited by  xxxd3237xxx  and consequently
peripheral ang ii levels are decreased, but this does not
have an impact on alcohol consumption. consequently,
only treatment of wild-types with the blood-brain-barrier crossing ace inhibitor  xxxd3237xxx  reduces alcohol
consumption, as a sufficient reduction of central ang ii
formation is only possible in these animals.
alcohol consumption has been suggested to depend
on bradykinin actions (30, 31) on the constitutively
expressed receptor b2. the absence of any difference
between the preference ratios of b2-deficient mice and
their wild-type littermates questions this hypothesis.
this notion is further strengthened by the finding
that  xxxd3237xxx  did not alter alcohol consumption of
tgr(asraogen)680. in these animals, the substantial
reduction of ace activity by  xxxd3237xxx  treatment doubtlessly influenced bradykinin levels. however, this did
not lead to any consequences in drinking behavior.
ang ii might lead to consumption of alcohol as a
result of motivations other than pharmacological effects. altered taste sensitivity and caloric contents of the

alcoholic solution are the most probable factors of
influence. however, since tgr(asraogen)680 were
indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates in
their response to saccharin, quinine, and sucrose, taste
reactivity, and caloric drives are unlikely to have a
decisive role in ang ii-modulated alcohol consumption.
ang ii belongs to a group of neuropeptides known to
stimulate dopamine release in the brain (18, 32).
moreover, angiotensin receptors are known to be expressed in brain areas such as the nucleus accumbens,
where dopaminergic transmission is implicated in alcohol self-administration and sensitivity. the concept of a
peptidergic modulation of reward, including alcohol
consumption, via a mesolimbic dopamine-mediated
transmission is frequently discussed (33, 34). the dopamine system is believed to be the critical component
in the reward circuitry of the mammalian cns (35).
according to this, we recently found that voluntary
alcohol consumption of the  xxxg99xxx -overexpressing tgm123 mice was significantly reduced upon
oral administration of the dopamine receptor antagonist fluphenazine, suggesting an interplay of ang ii and
the dopaminergic system in alcohol drinking behavior
(8). indeed,  xxxg656xxx -deficient mice have been
shown to drink less alcohol in a two-bottle, free choice
paradigm (36).
if the angiotensin-mediated dopamine release plays
an essential role in ang ii-triggered regulation of
alcohol intake, the dopamine concentrations should be
altered in relevant brain areas of tgr(asraogen)680, animals in which angiotensin generation
is drastically reduced in the cns. indeed, concentrations of dopamine as well as dopac were found to be
strongly reduced in a region covering the vta of
tgr(asraogen)680 rats. these results clearly support our hypothesis that pharmacological manipulations of the central ras, e.g., after oral application
of ace inhibitors reaching the cns, alter the alcohol intake via at1-mediated dopamine modulation
(fig. 7).
angiotensin has been shown to cause structural

changes in the brain. for example, angiotensinogendeficient mice exhibit a reduced cell number in the
hippocampus (37), and mice lacking the  xxxg101xxx  receptor
show an altered composition of cells in the amygdala
and other parts of the brain (38), which may be the
structural correlate to the x-linked mental retardation
observed in patients with a mutation in this receptor
(39). furthermore, tgr(asraogen)680 differ in the
development of the catecholaminergic neurons from
respective controls (40). thus, we cannot completely
exclude that structural alterations in the brain of the
genetically modified mice and rats may cause the
observed alterations in dopamine release and alcohol
consumption. however, the immediate effect of ace
inhibitors in our experiments with mice and rats, and
the exclusive involvement of the  xxxg100xxx  do not
support developmental defects as cause for the observed phenotypes.
measurement of the activity of tyrosine-hydroxylase,
frequently regarded as a key enzyme of the dopamine
biosynthesis, in several brain regions did not result in
any relevant differences between wild-type and
tgr(asraogen)680. the nature of the ang ii-induced modulation of the dopamine levels in the vtastraddling brain regions remains unclear.
up to now, effective causal therapeutic strategies for
treatment of alcohol addiction are rare. pharmacological interventions, including application of acamprosate or naltrexone, were developed mainly to help
patients maintain the procedures of withdrawal. more
detailed description of genetic factors involved in alcohol consumption and in the development of alcohol
addiction might be helpful for prevention and therapy.
studies with genetically modified animal models, such
as the one presented here, can unravel connections
between gene products (e.g., components of the ras),
and the genetic risk to develop this devastating disease
and can help to refine biochemical and molecular
diagnostics. these experiments may lead to novel targets for rational drug design. according to this report,
drugs interfering with the ras could be of particular
advantage because the available compounds (as ace

severe side effects and widely used in the treatment of
hypertension and in cardioprotection. as a consequence, future animal studies with the aim of developing drugs that influence drinking behavior by interfering with the ras should be performed with lipophilic
substances that effectively cross the blood-brain barrier.
finally, epidemiological studies should reveal how effective long-time treatment of modern ace inhibitors
or at1 blockers can be in the treatment of alcohol
addiction.
