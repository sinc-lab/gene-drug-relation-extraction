abstract. a model incubation system containing
purified  xxxg2320xxx  (tpo) was used to study
the mechanism of action of the thioureylene antithyroid drugs— xxxd3036xxx  (ptu), methylmercapto imidazole (mmi) and  xxxd435xxx . two
general types of experiments were performed: a)
measurement of the inhibitory effects of the drugs on
tpo-catalyzed iodination and on tpo-catalyzed oxidation of guaiacol, and b) studies of the metabolism
of ptu and mmi by the tpo model system. the
major observations can be summarized as follows: 1)
the thioureylene drugs are potent inhibitors of
tpo-catalyzed iodination of protein and tyrosine.
their potency increases greatly as the concentration
of i~ decreases. 2) the thioureylene drugs are also
potent inhibitors of tpo-catalyzed oxidation of
guaiacol, a reaction that does not involve iodide.
3) mmi and ptu are readily oxidized in the model
incubation system when iodide is present but not in
the absence of iodide. the rate of oxidation increased as the iodide concentration was increased
from 10 to 100 jam. 4) oxidation of ptu and mmi by
the model incubation system is inhibited by relatively slight increases in the concentration of ptu
and mmi. these drugs are capable of inhibiting
their own and each other's metabolism. 5) inhibition

t

he possibility that antithyroid
compounds exert their inhibitory effect by blocking  xxxg2320xxx  was
suggested even before there was convincing
evidence that peroxidase plays a role in thyroid hormone formation. the early studies
of possible mechanisms of action of antithyroid drugs have been ably reviewed by
astwood (2). more recently, morris and
hager (3) proposed a mechanism for the
action of compounds related to  xxxd3360xxx ,

the following abbreviations are used:  xxxg2320xxx  (tpo); l-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole (mmi);

of iodination is competitively antagonized by iodide
at low drug concentrations, but not at higher drug
concentrations. 6) inhibition of iodination by mmi
and ptu may be either reversible (low ratio of drug
to iodide), or irreversible (higher ratio of drug to
iodide). in reversible inhibition the iodination is
inhibited for a period which may be as brief as 2 min
or as long as 20 min, but thereafter, iodination begins, and there is escape from inhibition. during
the lag period there is extensive metabolism of the
drug. in the case of irreversible inhibition the iodination is inhibited completely or almost completely
for 60 min, and drug oxidation during this period
is relatively low. 7) irreversible inhibition may be
transformed into reversible inhibition by increasing
the concentration of tpo or the concentration of
iodide. however, increasing the concentration of
h2o2 or of tyrosine does not overcome irreversible
inhibition.
on the basis of these findings and of current
views concerning the mechanism of enzymatic
iodination, a scheme is proposed for the mechanism
of inhibition by thioureylene drugs of tpo-catalyzed
iodination of protein and tyrosine. (endocrinology

based on their studies with chloroperoxidase, a mold enzyme that catalyzes halogenation at acid ph's. they observed that
chloroperoxidase catalyzed the oxidation of
 xxxd3360xxx  only in the presence of iodide (or
other halogens), and they concluded that
tyrosine and  xxxd3360xxx  are competitive substrates for a common reactant. as illustrated
in fig. 1, they proposed the intermediary
formation of aperoxidase-iodinium complex
[e-i+], which could act either as an iodinating agent toward tyrosine, or as an oxidizing
agent toward  xxxd3360xxx . according to this
hypothesis, the thioureylene drugs2 inhibit

iodination by competing with tyrosine (or
tyrosyl residues of protein) for the activated
iodine complex, e-i+. a similar mechanism
was proposed by maloof and soodak (4),
based on their observation that thiourea is
oxidized by crude  xxxg2320xxx  in the
presence, but not in the absence, of iodide.
 xxxg2320xxx  (tpo) has been
isolated and purified in this laboratory (5,6),
and studies of the effect of various antithyroid drugs on tpo-catalyzed reactions have
been performed during the past several
years. almost all compounds with antithyroid activity were found to inhibit tpocatalyzed iodination (5,7). many of these
compounds also inhibited tpo-catalyzed
oxidation of guaiacol, a reaction that does
not involve iodide (7,8). the mechanism of
the latter inhibitory effect could not be explained by the scheme shown in fig. 1. it
appeared from these results that many antithyroid compounds, including the thioureylene drugs, are general inhibitors of tpocatalyzed reactions and not merely inhibitors of tpo-catalyzed iodination. this raised
the possibility that the scheme shown in fig.
1 represents only part of a more extensive
mechanism of action of antithyroid drugs.
they are a special class of the more general thioamide

thioureylenes.

in the present communication, the results
of studies with thioureylene drugs are reported, particularly with 6-propyl-2- xxxd3360xxx  ptu) and l-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole (mmi). a possible scheme is proposed
for the mechanism of inhibition by these
drugs of tpo-catalyzed iodination, based
on experiments with a model incubation system. the proposed scheme differs in certain
essential respects from that shown in fig. 1.

from amersham-searle. the initial specific activities were 36 mci/mmol for mmi and 50 mci/

incubation system for iodination. two types of
incubation system were used, one for short-term
(15 sec-1 min) studies employing exogenous
h2o2, the other for more prolonged incubations
(up to 60 min) employing h2o2 generated by
glucose + glucose oxidase. the standard incubation system in both cases contained 1 /xg/ml
tpo and, generally, 0.5 mg/ml bsa as the iodine
acceptor. the standard concentration of [131i]iodide was 100 (xm, although in many experiments the iodide concentration was varied over a
wide range. exogenous h2o2 was added at 100
jiim. for h2o2 generation glucose was present at
1 mg/ml, and glucose oxidase at 30-40 mu/ml.
all incubations were performed in 0.05-0.06m
phosphate buffer, ph 7.0. the incubation temperature was 37 c when glucose oxidase was used,
and either 37 c or 25 c in short-term incubations.
reactions were initiated either with h2o2 or with
glucose oxidase, and stopped by rapid addition
of concentrated mmi (final cone 5mm) and cooling to 0 c in an ice bath. departures from the
above conditions, when they occurred, are indicated with the results.

iodination experiments, except that 131i was
omitted.
measurement of bound iodine. a small portion
(25 fxl) of the incubation mixture was streaked
over a 3.5 cm line at one end of a strip of whatman 3mm paper, and the chromatograms were
developed in collidine-3n nh4oh (100:33) for
approximately 60 min. this short-term chromatography procedure was very convenient for
separating [ m i]iodoprotein, which remained at
the origin of the chromatogram, from unreacted
[13ii]iodide, which moved close to the solvent
front. the 131i remaining at the origin was calculated as a fraction of the total 131i on the chromatogram. multiplication of this fraction by the
concentration of stable iodide gave the quantity
of iodine bound to protein. a correction was made
for the small fraction of the 131i remaining at
the origin in the absence of added enzyme.
results were generally expressed as nmoles of i
bound to protein per ml.
in experiments involving iodination of free
tyrosine, the paper chromatography in the collidine-nh4oh solvent was continued for at least
6 h. the dried paper strips were placed in contact
with x-ray film for 24-48 h, and the areas of
the chromatogram corresponding to the darkening on the film, together with the origin and
intermediate areas, were excised and counted
in a well-type scintillation counter. the fraction
of the total 131i present in the monoiodotyrosine
(mit) + diiodotyrosine (dit) fraction was determined, and nmoles of i bound as mit
+ dit were calculated, based on the initial

spectrophotometric procedure for following
metabolism of mml and ptu. the metabolism
of both mmi and ptu by the tpo system
could conveniently be followed with a double
beam spectrophotometer (hitachi-colemanperkin elmer). this is illustrated in fig. 2, which
shows the difference spectrum between two incubation mixtures, differing only by the presence
of tpo in the sample cell. the disappearance
of mmi from the sample cell, based on its
characteristic a250 peak, is clearly indicated. the
appearance of material absorbing in the vicinity
of 300 nm is also apparent. the latter most likely
represents products of mmi oxidation. with ptu,

the peak of the disappearance trough occurred
at 272 nm, and there was evidence of an oxidation product at 240 nm.
for measurements of the rate and extent of
metabolism of mmi and ptu, the spectrophotometer was set at either 250 or 272 nm, respectively, and the change in absorbance with time
was measured, after initiating the reaction in the
sample cuvette with h2o2, or with glucose oxidase. from the measured mm extinction coefficients (16 for mmi, 17 for ptu) it was possible
to estimate the amount of drug that disappeared
from the sample cell, assuming that none of
the products of oxidation absorbed appreciably
at these wave lengths. the symmetry of the disappearance trough in fig. 2 supports this assumption for mmi, as does also the observation that
75-85% of the total mmi present disappeared
within a couple of minutes when the starting
concentration was 10 nmoles/ml. with ptu the
disappearance trough was not so symmetrical,
and interference from oxidation products may
have introduced a greater error than with mmi.
for this reason the values obtained for ptu
with this procedure are most probably underestimates of the actual amount of drug metabolized.

dose-inhibition curves. figure 3 shows the
degree of inhibition of tpo-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin by varying concentrations of the 3 most commonly used
anti-thyroid drugs, ptu,  xxxd2594xxx , and
 xxxd435xxx . all three compounds are potent inhibitors of iodination. under the conditions of this test system, the concentrations
required for 50% inhibition of iodination
were:  xxxd435xxx , 10.5 /u,m;  xxxd2594xxx ,
11.5 /am; and ptu, 18.5 /um. ptu consistently showed a significantly lower inhibitory effect than mmi and  xxxd435xxx  in
the model system.
the results with  xxxd435xxx  suggest that
this drug need not be hydrolyzed to mmi
to act as an effective inhibitor of iodination. it was originally believed that the
chemicals and reagents. glucose oxidase, sigma carbethoxy blocking group in  xxxd435xxx 
chemical co. 39 u/mg; ptu, american cyana- was attached to the sulfur atom of the
imidazole ring (10), but later studies indicated that it was more probably bound to

results were obtained in the presence of
other proteins (bsa, fibrinogen, y-globulin).
metabolism of the drugs also occurred in the
absence of added protein, but in this case
there was no formation of protein-bound 35s.
no significant metabolism of either [35s]mmi or [35s]ptu could be detected if tpo
(figs. 4b and 5b) or iodide (figs. 4c and 5c)
was omitted from the incubation systems.
m aloof and soodak previously demonstrated
(4) that oxidation of thiourea by a crude
 xxxg2320xxx  system also required
iodide (or thiocyanate), and morris and
hager similarly showed (3) that iodide (or
other halogen) was required for chloroperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of  xxxd3360xxx .
of particular interest in the present study
are the findings shown in figs. 4d and 5d,
which demonstrate that slight elevations in
the concentrations of the antithyroid drugs
produced marked inhibition of drug metabolism. as shown in fig. 4d, oxidation of
[35s]mmi was greatly reduced when the
mmi concentration was increased from 10
to 20 /am. similarly (fig. 5d) oxidation of
[35s]ptu was markedly inhibited when the
ptu concentration was elevated from 20
 xxxd2136xxx  to 50 (jlm. in one experiment with [35s]ptu, performed with ptu concentrations
ranging from 20 to 50 /xm, the chromatograms were cut into sections, eluted with
dilute alkali, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. this provided an estimate

of the fraction of initial ptu degraded.
the product of the fraction degraded and initial concentration of ptu yielded the total
amount of ptu degraded. these values
were then plotted against initial ptu concentration, as shown in fig. 6. it is evident
that total ptu degradation was markedly inhibited with only a slight increase in initial
ptu concentration. similarly, a relatively
slight increase in initial mmi concentration resulted in a marked decrease in total
mmi degradation. it appeared from these
results that ptu and mmi inhibit their
own metabolism by the tpo system with
only slight elevations in their concentrations. further evidence for this was obtained
with spectrophotometric measurements, as
described in the following section.

inhibition of oxidation as the drug concentration was increased, confirming the conclusion derived from the chromatographic

should be noted that h2o2 rather than glucose oxidase, was used in the incubation
system for fig. 7, thus eliminating the possibility that inhibition of glucose oxidase,
rather than  xxxg2320xxx , was responsible for the observed effects. evidence
was obtained in other experiments (results
not shown) that 50 fim mmi and 50 /xm ptu
do not inhibit glucose oxidase.
the effect of varying i~ concentration on
oxidation of ptu by the tpo system is
shown in table 1. in the absence of added
i", no detectable oxidation of ptu was observed. maximal oxidation of ptu under
these conditions was achieved with 100 /u-m

system was similarly iodide-dependent.
escape from inhibitiori of iodination with
time. with the lower concentrations of mmi
and ptu it was observed that the inhibition of iodination in the standard test system
was transient. this is shown in fig. 8 for
ptu. the control iodination curve showed
a slight lag, which could be attributed to
the time required to build up the h2o2 concentration after the initiation of the reaction
with glucose oxidase. thereafter, the control
rate of iodination was practically linear.
as shown in fig. 8, the addition of 20 /xm

thereafter there was escape from inhibition,
and the iodination proceeded at very nearly
the control rate. an increase in the ptu
concentration to 30 /am produced complete
inhibition for more than 4 min, but by 6 min
the rate of iodination was very close to that
of the control. a further slight increase in
the ptu concentration to only 40 /am produced a much longer lag period. in this
case the iodination did not begin until after
20 min, and the rate was considerably
below that of the control. the next small
increment in ptu concentration, an elevation to 50  xxxd2136xxx , resulted in irreversible inhibition of iodination. under these conditable 1. effect of varying i" concentration on

tions there was no escape from inhibition
even after 60 min. the escape from inhibition at the lower concentrations of ptu
could be correlated with the metabolism of

similar results (not shown) were obtained
with mmi, except that the effects occurred
with somewhat lower concentrations, in
keeping with the greater potency of mmi
shown in fig. 3. the change from reversible
to irreversible inhibition of iodination with
both ptu and mmi occurred with seemingly slight elevations in the concentrations

and inhibitory effects of ptu and mmi on

the data presented on inhibition of iodination by ptu and mmi were obtained with
incubation systems containing 100 ju,m i".
however, changes in i~ concentration had
profound effects on the inhibitory potency of
ptu and mmi, as illustrated in figs. 9 and
10 and in table 2. figure 9 shows doseinhibition curves for ptu and mmi over a
wide range of i~ concentrations, from practically 0 (carrier-free 131i) to 1000 /am. it is apparent that the potency of both drugs increases greatly as the i~ concentration is
diminished. a similar conclusion may be
reached from the lineweaver-burk plots
shown in fig. 10, in which the reciprocal
of the iodide concentration is plotted against
the reciprocal of the initial rate of iodination of bsa. the marked upward curvature of the lineweaver-burk plots (also

is surmounted. however, as can be seen
from fig. 9 the inhibitory effect of doses of
mmi and ptu in the range of 50-60 /am
is not overcome in short-term incubations
even with 1000 /am i~.
the effects of changes in the relative concentrations of drug and i~ on escape from
inhibition with time are shown in table 2. it
is apparent from these results that escape
from inhibition at a fixed concentration of
tpo, glucose-glucose oxidase, and bsa is
governed not by the absolute concentration
of ptu or mmi but by the concentration of
ptu or mmi relative to the i~ concentration. for example, at a low concentration of
iodide (10 /am) there was no escape from
inhibition by 10 /am mmi or by 20 /am ptu.
however, inhibition by these levels of mmi
and ptu was readily overcome, in time,
by elevation of the i~ concentration to 100
/am (table 2, fig. 8). similarly, the irreversible inhibition produced with 20 /am mmi or
50 /am ptu in the presence of 100 /am i~ was
reversed, in time, when the iodide concentration was raised to 500 /am (table 2).
however, inhibition by 100 /am mmi or ptu
was not reversed by 1000 /am i", and in
another experiment (results not shown), was
not reversed by iodide concentrations as
high as 10 mm.
it can be seen in table 2 that inhibition
by 20 /am ptu was overcome by 30 /am i",

endo • 1976

but inhibition by 10 /am mmi was not.
in separate experiments the effect of i~ on
oxidation of mmi and ptu under these
same conditions was determined with the
spectrophotometric procedure. it was observed that approximately 60% of the ptu
was oxidized, but only about 10% of the
mmi. these results provide further evidence for a correlation between drug metabolism and escape from inhibition. in all
cases where the appropriate measurements
were made it was observed that irreversible
inhibition of iodination by ptu and mmi
was associated with little or no drug oxidation, and conversely, that escape from inhibition was associated with extensive drug
oxidation.
effect of increasing tyrosine concentration on drug oxidation and on escape of
iodination from inhibition by mmi. the
schemes previously suggested for the mechanism of action of antithyroid drugs (3,4)
postulate a competition between tyrosine
and the drugs for an activated form of iodine. the latter is presumably a complex
between tpo and an oxidized form of iodine, which is thought to act either as an
iodinating agent toward tyrosine or as an
oxidizing agent toward mmi and ptu. it
was of interest, therefore, in the present
study, to determine whether evidence could
be obtained for competition between tyrosine and mmi. to test this possibility experiments were set up with varying concentrations of tyrosine as acceptor. tyrosine
was substituted for bsa because it had
been previously observed (taurog, unpublished observations) that iodination of bsa
is inhibited when the bsa concentration
is elevated above approximately 1 mg/ml.
table 3 shows results of an experiment in
which oxidation of mmi by a standard tpo
incubation system was measured over a
wide range of tyrosine concentrations. no
significant effect of tyrosine concentration
on oxidation of mmi was detected. these
results do not support the view that tyrosine
and mmi compete for a common form of
activated iodine, at least, within the con-

mechanism of antithyroid drug action
centration range tested in this experiment.
if tyrosine iodination and mmi oxidation
both involve reaction with a common iodine
intermediate then the reaction must greatly
favor mmi oxidation.
in another experiment (table 4) measurements were made to determine whether inhibition of tyrosine iodination by 20 /xm
mmi could be overcome by increasing the
tyrosine concentration. in contrast to the
results obtained by increasing i~ concentration (table 2), there was no significant effect
of increasing tyrosine concentration on
escape from inhibition by 20 /xm mmi.
escape from inhibition by 10 fim mmi occurred with tyrosine iodination in much the
same manner as with iodination of bsa.
failure of increased tyrosine concentration
(to 1 mm) to overcome inhibition by 20 ju,m
mmi again indicates that tyrosine does not
compete with mmi for a common reactant.
from the results in tables 3 and 4 it may
be concluded that if the same active enzymeiodine complex reacts with both tyrosine and
mmi it is unlikely that the same site is
involved in both reactions.

previously reported from this laboratory
(7) that mmi, ptu, and  xxxd435xxx  are
potent inhibitors of tpo-catalyzed oxidation

potency of these drugs in inhibiting guaiacol
oxidation is comparable to their potency

in inhibiting iodination at low levels of i"
(fig. 9). guaiacol, itself, appears to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of tpo-catalyzed iodination (14). the results in fig. 11 demonstrate that the thioureylene drugs do not
require iodide in order to act as inhibitors
of tpo-catalyzed reactions. they may be
regarded as generalized inhibitors of tpocatalyzed oxidation reactions. the latter
possibility was not considered by morris
and hager (3) or by maloof and soodak (4)
in their schemes for the mechanism of
action of antithyroid drugs on peroxidasecatalyzed iodination. however, the observations in fig. 11 play a major role in the
scheme presented below for the mechanism
of inhibition by thioureylene drugs of tpocatalyzed iodination.
discussion
any scheme that is proposed for the mechanism of inhibition by the thioureylene
drugs of tpo-catalyzed iodination must be
capable of explaining the findings reported
in this communication. these include: 1)
the observation that thioureylene drugs are
also very potent inhibitors of tpo-catalyzed
oxidation of guaiacol, 2) the finding that
mmi and ptu inhibit their own oxidation
when their concentrations are slightly

elevated, 3) the observation that iodide
antagonizes inhibition by low drug concentrations but not by moderately elevated
drug concentrations, 4) the greater sensitivity of the iodination to inhibition at low i"
concentrations, 5) the escape of the iodination from inhibition at low ratios of drug to
iodide concentration, 6) the irreversibility of
the inhibition of iodination at higher ratios
of drug to iodide concentration, and 7) the
failure of increased tyrosine concentrations
to overcome inhibition by low drug concentrations.
in addition, of course, any proposed
scheme for explaining the inhibitory effects
of thioureylene drugs on enzymatic iodination must also be based on an understanding of the mechanisms of tpo-catalyzed iodination in the absence of inhibitor. unfortunately, at the present time, it is only
possible to speculate regarding the mechanism of tpo-catalyzed iodination. on the
basis of previous studies of peroxidasecatalyzed iodination (3,13,15-17) performed
in different laboratories, it appears likely
that the active iodinating agent is a complex
between tpo and an oxidized form of
iodine. it has not yet been established
whether tpo-catalyzed oxidation of i~ involves a one-electron change, with formation of an iodine-free radical (16,18), or a
two-electron change, with formation of

i+ (3,4). in the former case the active
iodinating species should be depicted as
[e-i • ], in the latter case as [e-i+]. because
of this uncertainty the active iodinating
species is depicted in this report simply as
[e-i]. the overall reaction for its formation
is represented in equation 1.

this equation omits the unknown intermediate steps and is not balanced because of
the unknown nature of i in the complex.
iodination presumably occurs through a
reaction between [e-i] and tyrosyl (or tyrosine), as indicated in eq. 2.

nunez and pommier (15,16) have suggested that the iodination mechanism involves oxidation of tyrosyl to a free radical
at a second site on the enzyme. iodotyrosine
is then produced by a reaction between an
iodine radical and a tyrosine radical. however, this attractive hypothesis remains to
be confirmed.
within the framework of the aboveoutlined mechanism of iodination, the following points concerning the mechanism
of inhibition of iodination are suggested by
the results of the present study:
a) reaction 1 is inhibited by thioureylene
drugs, and this inhibition is competitive

mechanism of antithyroid drug action
with iodide over a limited range of drug
(figs. 9 and 10, and table 2). these results
suggest that thioureylene drugs bind to the
enzyme either at the same site as iodide or
at a nearby site, and that this binding interferes with the binding of iodide. the drug
itself may or may not be metabolized as
described in (b).
b) the thioureylene drugs themselves are
oxidized by the [e-i] formed in reaction 1.
when the ratio of concentration of drug to i
is sufficiently high, little or no [e-i] is
formed, and little or no drug oxidation occurs. in this manner the drugs may inhibit
their own oxidation by the tpo system.
however, at lower ratios of drug to i~, sufficient [e-i] is formed to metabolize most of
the drug. under these conditions there is
escape of the iodination from inhibition.
c) it appears likely that the [e-i ] formed in
reaction 1 reacts both with the thioureylene
drugs to yield oxidized drug and with tyrosyl
residues or tyrosine to yield iodotyrosines.
however, as shown in tables 3 and 4, it
low ratio of drug to iodide

was not possible to overcome inhibition of
iodination or to depress drug oxidation by
greatly increasing the concentration of tyrosine relative to drug. no competition could
be demonstrated between tyrosine and mmi
in these experiments or in experiments
involving double reciprocal plots with varying tyrosine and mmi concentrations (results not shown). if, indeed, [e-i] reacts
with both tyrosyl and mmi, then the reaction
with mmi must be a highly preferred pathway. the km for tyrosine in the tpocatalyzed iodination with 100 fim i~ was
estimated to be about 40 /xm (taurog, unpublished results), a value not much higher
than the concentration of mmi required for
50% inhibition of iodination (about 10  xxxd2136xxx ).
it does not appear likely, therefore, that the
highly preferential reaction of mmi with
[e-i] can be attributed to a much higher affinity of the enzyme for mmi than for tyrosine. a preference for oxidation over iodination was also seen in previously reported
experiments (19) involving tpo-catalyzed
increased ratio of drug to iodide

iodination of proteins rich in sh groups.
iodination of the protein did not begin until
a good part of the sh was oxidized.
a scheme based on the above suggestions
for the mechanism of action of thioureylene
drugs is shown in fig. 12. the scheme
is divided into two halves, the left half
showing the proposed mechanism at a low
ratio of drug concentration to iodide concentration (e.g., 10 fim mmi and 100 /mm
i~), and the right half showing the mechanism at higher ratios of drug to iodide
concentration (e.g., 20 /xm mmi and 100
 xxxd2136xxx  i~). under both conditions the drug is
regarded as acting primarily to inhibit reaction 1. however, as pointed out above,
this inhibition is antagonized by iodide,
and the scheme in the left half of fig. 12
is intended to depict the events that occur
when the relative concentrations of drug and
iodide are such that iodide competes
favorably with the drug. under these conditions it is proposed that the formation of
[e-i] occurs readily, and that this, in turn,
leads to extensive drug oxidation and to
escape of the iodination from inhibition.
however, when the drug to iodide concentration ratio is increased, as depicted in the
right half of fig. 12, inhibition of reaction 1
is much more complete. in this case, it is
proposed that there is little or no formation of
[e-i], and, as a consequence of this blockade, there is little or no drug oxidation and
no escape of the iodination from inhibition.
the range of drug concentrations that can
be antagonized by iodide is limited. in the
standard incubation system, it was not possible to overcome inhibition by 100 (jlm
mmi or ptu with any concentration of i~.
thus at high concentrations of drug the
scheme on the right applies, regardless of
the concentration of iodide.
the mechanism of action of thioureylene
drugs proposed in fig. 12 differs from that
suggested by morris and hager (3) and by
maloof and soodak (4). these investigators
postulated that agents like mmi and ptu
act by competing with tyrosyl for an activated form of iodine, which they suggested
was enzyme-bound iodinium. according to

endo • 1976
vol 98 . no 4

their scheme, these antithyroid compounds
do not interfere with the formation of [e-i]
(reaction 1), but only with its fate after it
is formed (reaction 2). however, as has
been previously pointed out (7,8), and as is
reemphasized in the present study, thioureylene drugs are also potent inhibitors of
tpo-catalyzed oxidation of guaiacol, a reaction that may be considered analogous to
the oxidation of i~ in reaction 1. it is not
unreasonable, therefore, to postulate that
these drugs may also inhibit the oxidation of
i". this assumption is incorporated into the
proposed scheme (fig. 12) for explaining
the varied observations made in this study.
furthermore, the data obtained here do not
support the competitive inhibition between
tyrosyl and drug for [e-i] proposed by the
previous investigators. it seems more likely
that different sites on the enzyme-iodine
complex are involved in iodination and in
drug oxidation.
presumably the aim in therapy with antithyroid drugs should be to maintain a sufficient thyroidal concentration of drug to
prevent rapid escape of iodination from inhibition. however, this does not necessarily
imply that the concentration must be sufficient to block reaction 1 completely.
because antithyroid drugs are taken at frequent intervals, it is possible that a fairly
steady level of drug is maintained within
the thyroid, as suggested by the recent
study of pharmakiotis and alexander (20)
in rats. this may be sufficient to continually
divert [e-i] toward drug oxidation, thus inhibiting iodination. data reported from
alexander's laboratory (21) suggest that in
rats injected with a single dose of [35s]ptu, complete inhibition of iodination
occurs simultaneously with drug oxidation.
under these conditions, therefore, it appears
that the intrathyroidal drug concentration
(estimated to reach a peak of about 65 /xm)
is not sufficient to block reaction 1. in rats
given repeated injections of [35s]ptu, pharmakiotis and alexander (20) obtained suggestive evidence that intrathyroidal drug
metabolism was inhibited. studies are under
way in this laboratory to explore further the

mechanism of antithyroid drug action
possibility that intrathyroidal drug metabolism may be blocked in rats receiving large,
repeated doses of ptu and mmi.
the studies reported in this investigation
are based entirely on in vitro experiments
with the model incubation system. it is not
known to what extent these observations
simulate the mechanism of intrathyroidal
metabolism of thioureylene drugs in vivo.
it is possible that additional mechanisms
exist in the thyroid gland for metabolizing
these compounds. however, the following
two pieces of evidence favor the view that
the in vitro findings reported here have
some physiological significance: 1. the
metabolic products of [35s]ptu and [35s]mmi oxidation by the tpo incubation system are similar to those seen in thyroid
homogenates from rats injected with these
labeled compounds. for example, thyroidal
metabolism of [35s]ptu in rats has been
shown by marchantef al. (21) and by riesco
and taurog (unpublished observations) to
yield 3 distinct products on chromatography
in  xxxd102xxx ln ammonium acetate: a) an
origin product, presumably representing
protein bound sulfur, b) sulfate, and c) an
unidentified metabolite (designated "x")
moving just behind ptu, which is the chief
product of ptu metabolism. the same distribution of 35s metabolic products was
observed after in vitro incubation of [35s]ptu with the tpo system (results not
shown). thyroidal metabolism of [35s]mmi
in rats yields [35s]sulfate as one of the
products (22), (riesco and taurog, unpublished observations). in the in vitro system,
as shown in fig. 4, [35s]sulfate was the chief
oxidation product of [35s]mmi. 2. it would
be expected from the iodide dependency of
drug oxidation by the tpo system, shown
in the present study and previously by
maloof and soodak (3), that iodine deficiency would reduce intrathyroidal drug
metabolism in vivo. decreased intrathyroidal drug oxidation in iodine-deficient rats
has now been observed by several groups
of investigators. maloof and soodak (4)
reported decreased accumulation and oxidation of [35s]thiourea in thyroids of iodine-

1045

deficient rats, and very recently marchantef
al. (23) reported decreased intrathyroidal
metabolism of [35s ]mmi in thyroids of rats on
a low-iodine diet. studies in this laboratory
(riesco and taurog, unpublished observations) have also demonstrated a reduced
uptake and metabolism of [35s]mmi and
especially, of [35s]ptu, in thyroids of severely iodine-deficient rats. lindsay et al.
(24) recently reported decreased uptake of
[14c]ptu and [14c]mmi by thyroids of rats
fed a low iodine diet.
on the other hand, it might also be inferred from the results of the present study
that thyroids of iodine-deficient rats should
be more sensitive to the inhibitory action
of ptu and mmi than thyroids of iodinesufficient rats, especially in view of the results shown in fig. 9. however, we have
been unable to demonstrate the expected
greater potency of ptu and mmi in iodinedeficient rats (lamas and taurog, unpublished observations). the effects of iodine
deficiency in vivo, therefore, are not simply
analogous to the effects of reducing the iodide concentration in the tpo incubation
system. studies in this laboratory are continuing in an attempt to understand more
fully the effect of iodine deficiency on the
action of thioureylene drugs in vivo.
the studies presented in this communication have dealt only with the mechanism
of inhibition of tyrosyl iodination by thioureylene drugs, i.e., with the inhibition
of iodotyrosine formation. however, results
in several laboratories have established
that ptu and mmi may also inhibit the
coupling reaction, both in vivo (25,26) and
in vitro (7,27). experiments with intact rats
receiving graded doses of ptu have led to
the conclusion that t4 formation in the thyroid is more sensitive than iodotyrosine formation to the inhibitory action of ptu (25,
26). richards and ingbar (25) suggested
on this basis that antithyroid drugs such
as ptu may have a specific inhibitory

ments in which graded doses of ptu were
added to the tpo model system. under
these conditions also, it was possible to find
a concentration of ptu that had no significant effect on [131i]iodotyrosine formation
but which significantly inhibited [131i]thyroxine (t4) formation. however, in the light
of the results presented in this communication on escape from inhibition, it now seems
possible that an alternative explanation can
be offered for the previously reported results. escape from inhibition may have occurred earlier with the lower doses of antithyroid drug, thus leading to the conclusion
that no inhibition had occurred at any time.
it thus seems possible that even the low
doses of antithyroid drug produced at least
transient inhibition of iodination. further
studies are required, therefore, before it can
be concluded that antithyroid drugs have
a specific inhibitory effect on t4 formation
independent of their effect on iodination.
an additional factor that could be of importance in this respect has been suggested
by papapetrou et al. (28). these investigators showed that ptu, or one of its metabolic
products, becomes bound to thyroglobulin
in the thyroid glands of rats. they raised
the possibility that this binding could affect
thyroglobulin structure in such a way as to
inhibit the coupling reaction. binding of
both ptu and mmi (or their metabolic
products) to thyroglobulin has subsequently
been observed in the tpo model system
when these drugs act as inhibitors of iodination (29).
acknowledgments
the excellent technical assitance of martha l. dorris
in the early phases of this study is gratefully acknowledged. i am also indebted to drs. jean wilson
and garcilaso riesco for helpful discussions.
