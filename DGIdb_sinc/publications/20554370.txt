objective: to evaluate the efﬁcacy and safety of aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx  combination against
aceclofenac alone in patients with primary dysmenorrhoea.
study design: this double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, comparative, multicentric study enrolled
200 women (100 women in each arm) in the age range of 18–35 years with primary dysmenorrhoea at
four centers. the patients were randomly allocated to either aceclofenac 100 mg– xxxd1947xxx  80 mg b.i.d
or aceclofenac 100 mg alone b.i.d for a maximum of 3 days. primary efﬁcacy parameters were total area
under pain relief (pr) score up to 4 and 8 h (topar/4 and topar/8). secondary efﬁcacy measurements
were pain-intensity difference (pid), sum of pid over 4 and 8 h (spid/4 and spid/8), peak pid over 4 and
8 h and peak pr over 4 and 8 h, total study drug consumption, and patient’s and investigator’s global
evaluation of the efﬁcacy.
results: both treatments showed signiﬁcant improvement in baseline values in all efﬁcacy parameters.
the combination was signiﬁcantly superior to monotherapy in terms of topar/4 (24.0 vs 18.54)
(p = 0.000) and topar/8 (40.3 vs 35.2) (p = 0.003), spid/4 ( 17.9 vs 13.88) (p = 0.000) and spid/8
( 31.06 vs 26.8) (p = 0.001), peak pid/4 ( 6.60 vs 5.75) (p = 0.001) and peak pr/4 (8.26 vs 7.10)
(p = 0.000). at the end of 8 h, both treatments were comparable with respect to peak pid/8 and peak pr/8
(p > 0.05). the total number of doses consumed by patients treated with combination therapy was less
than with monotherapy (150 vs 168 doses). the combination was signiﬁcantly superior to monotherapy
with respect to patient’s and investigator’s global evaluation of the efﬁcacy (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001,
respectively). both treatments were well tolerated.
conclusion: this study establishes the efﬁcacy of aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx  combination in patients with
primary dysmenorrhoea. the ﬁxed-dose combination of aceclofenac and  xxxd1947xxx  should therefore be
considered as a suitable, effective and well tolerated treatment option for primary dysmenorrhoea.

1. introduction
dysmenorrhoea is a commonly encountered gynecological
disorder with a great personal and public health impact. it is
estimated that more than 50% of menstruating women have
dysmenorrhoea and that 10% have severe dysmenorrhoea which is
incapacitating for 1–3 days a month and is most severe during the

ﬁrst 2 days of menstruation [1]. dysmenorrheal pain is suprapubic
and spasmodic, and associated with other symptoms like painful
menstrual cramps [2], nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue,
dizziness and headache [3].
primary dysmenorrhoea is believed to be prostaglandin (pg)
mediated. exacerbated or atypical endometrial responses to
complex regulatory mechanisms lead to excessive pg synthesis
at menstruation. this appears to induce uncoordinated hyperactivity of the uterine muscles resulting in uterine ischemia and pain
[2]. the amount of  xxxd1902xxx  in menstrual ﬂuid correlates with cramps
and pain [4]. appropriate treatments for the management of

a. pareek et al. / european journal of obstetrics & gynecology and reproductive biology 152 (2010) 86–90

primary dysmenorrhoea include nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory
agents (nsaids), oral contraceptives and non-pharmacological
treatments such as diet, exercise and topical heat [2]. however,
treatment with nsaids has proven to be effective in the treatment
of dysmenorrhoea, providing signiﬁcant relief from associated pain
[5].
aceclofenac is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is involved in the production of prostaglandins
[6]. the european observational cohort study has validated
aceclofenac as an effective, well tolerated therapy for both acute
and chronic inﬂammatory conditions with considerable value to
both patient and physician in management of pain [7].  xxxd1947xxx , a benzylisoquinoline derivative, has smooth muscle relaxant
properties. it causes smooth muscle relaxation by increasing
intracellular levels of cyclic- xxxd81xxx  (camp),
secondary to inhibition of phosphodiesterase [8,9].
aceclofenac is an effective analgesic/anti-inﬂammatory whose
efﬁcacy has already been established for various indications,
whereas  xxxd1947xxx  as a smooth muscle relaxant reduces uterine
contraction, which eventually improves uterine blood ﬂow and
hypoxia. hence aceclofenac with  xxxd1947xxx  should be an
effective combination in relieving pain due to dysmenorrhoea.
this consideration led us to conduct a randomized comparative
study to evaluate the beneﬁts of adding  xxxd1947xxx  to aceclofenac
in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea.
2. materials and methods
2.1. study design
this was a randomized, comparative, double-blind, doubledummy, multicentric study conducted at government medical
college & hospital (nagpur); g.r. medical college & ja group of
hospitals (gwalior); isha diagnostic centre (bangalore) and b.j.
medical college & sassoon general hospitals (pune). the study was
approved by the ethics committee of each center and written
informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to any
study-related procedure. the execution and monitoring of the
study were done in accordance with the requirements of good
clinical practice.
2.2. subject selection criteria
female patients aged between 18 and 35 years, with regular
menstruation (28  7-day cycle) with a history of primary dysmenorrhoea (reporting 4 painful periods from the previous six menses)
characterized by pain intensity of 6 on an 11-point pain-intensity
numerical rating scale (pi-nrs) [10] at screening visit were enrolled
in this study.
women were excluded if they had other conditions associated
with recurrent pelvic or lower abdominal pain, such as dysmenorrhoea secondary to endometriosis or pelvic inﬂammatory disease.
pregnant and lactating women or women of child bearing potential
not practising contraception were not enrolled in the study.
additionally, women were excluded if there was a history or
evidence of signiﬁcant hematological, gastrointestinal, cardiac,
vascular, immune, respiratory, metabolic, endocrine, or allergic
disorders; serious adverse reactions or hypersensitivity to aspirin
or other nsaids or study drugs; or a history or any evidence of
substance abuse or addiction. women were also excluded if they
had used an intrauterine device or oral contraceptives within six
months prior to the study; or had received nsaids or analgesics
within 48 h prior to study entry. patients with abnormal renal or
hepatic function or patients receiving insulin, systemic corticosteroids, enzyme inductors or inhibitors, drugs affecting platelet
function and coagulation or any other concomitant medications

87

that may interact with the action of the study drugs were excluded
from this trial.
2.3. treatment procedures
female patients with history of primary dysmenorrhoea
underwent screening based upon their complete medical and
gynecologic history/examination. patients satisfying the inclusion
and exclusion criteria were randomized to receive aceclofenac
(100 mg)– xxxd1947xxx  (80 mg) ﬁxed-dose combination b.i.d or
aceclofenac (100 mg b.i.d) for a maximum of 3 days. computerized
block randomization technique was used for allocating study
medications. the double-blind, double-dummy design was
adopted for masking the identity of study medications to eliminate
bias. during the initial visit, study investigators asked each patient
to rate the severity of pain associated with menstruation on an 11point pi-nrs. the study medication was administered to the
patient as soon as the patient reported pain intensity of 6 on the
11-point pi-nrs.
patients were kept under strict observation at the study site for
the ﬁrst 4 h after the ﬁrst dose administration for efﬁcacy
assessment. patients were evaluated for efﬁcacy parameters at
0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after the ﬁrst dose of study
medication. if pain associated with dysmenorrhoea was relieved
after 24 h, the patient directly underwent end of therapy
evaluations without receiving further medications. the painintensity and pain-relief scores at 8, 12, 24 and 48 h were captured
by the patient in the patient’s diary. patients were allowed to take
rescue medication during the trial period, but not within 4 h of ﬁrst
dose administration.
2.4. efﬁcacy criteria
the efﬁcacy outcome measures were changes in pain-intensity
score, pain-relief score, total study drug consumption and global
efﬁcacy evaluation. pain intensity was assessed on the 11-point pinrs, categorized as 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain. pain
relief was also assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale
categorized as 0 = no relief and 10 = complete relief. the main
efﬁcacy variable was total pain relief expressed as total area under
pain-relief score to 4 h (topar/4) and 8 h (topar/8). this was
summed time-weighted pain-relief scores to 4 and 8 h.
secondary efﬁcacy variables included pain-intensity difference
(pid: baseline minus pain-intensity at each subsequent time
point); summed time-weighted pain-intensity differences to 4 h
(spid/4) and 8 h (spid/8); peak pid (maximum differences in painintensity scores from baseline recorded to 4 and 8 h) and peak pr
(maximum pain-relief score recorded to 4 and 8 h).
both groups were also compared with respect to study drug
consumption.
patient’s and investigator’s global evaluation of study drug
effectiveness was recorded at the end of therapy using a 5-point
likert scale (0 = poor; 1 = fair; 2 = good; 3 = very good; 4 = excellent). investigators had used a pain-scale visual tool. investigators
had asked the patients to represent themselves in a visual tool
which exactly matches with their present state. investigators
performed this exercise during baseline and at the end of therapy
and, based on the improvement, investigators rated investigator’s
global evaluation of treatment effectiveness.
2.5. safety criteria
all patients enrolled in the study were eligible for safety
assessment. safety evaluation was based on adverse events (ae)
reported during the study. ae were deﬁned as unfavorable and
unintended signs, including an abnormal laboratory ﬁnding,

88

a. pareek et al. / european journal of obstetrics & gynecology and reproductive biology 152 (2010) 86–90

symptoms, or temporary disease associated with use of study
drugs. ae were categorized by the investigator according to their
intensity as mild, moderate or severe and the relationship to the
study drug as none, probably not, possible, probable or deﬁnite. at
every visit during the entire study period, reported ae, clinical
state of patients and details of concomitant medication, if, any
were captured in crfs. patients were encouraged to report ae
spontaneously or in response to a general non-directed questionnaire. signiﬁcant changes, if any, in the laboratory parameters
were assessed by obtaining blood samples at baseline and at the
end of therapy to perform routine hematology and biochemistry.
2.6. statistical methods
the sample size calculation was based on the difference
between the pi-nrs scores. it was calculated that a minimum of
100 patients would be needed in each treatment arm (allowing
20% dropouts) to detect a difference of 0.45 between groups with a
two-sided type-i error of 0.05 and 80% power. the two treatment
groups were analyzed for homogeneity at baseline by using tests
like student’s t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test
for categorical variables.
statistical analyses were based on the per protocol (pp) method.
in the pp analysis, patients lost to follow-up and those excluded
after enrolment were excluded from the analysis and only patients
with complete follow-up were included in the analysis. the
efﬁcacy variable was assessed by comparison of pain-relief score
between the two treatment groups and measuring changes in pinrs scores from baseline to subsequent time points. comparison of
changes in scores in both treatments was done using tests like
ancova, student’s t-test, and mann–whitney u-test as appropriate. patient’s and investigator’s assessments of overall response
were evaluated using chi-square test or fisher’s exact test as
appropriate. for intra-group comparisons, paired t-test or wilcoxon test were used as appropriate. changes in laboratory
parameters were evaluated by paired t-test, wilcoxon signed rank
test as appropriate. the entire statistical tests were two sided and
the level of signiﬁcance was set at 0.05. p-value of >0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. results
between october 2008 and april 2009, 263 subjects were
screened and 200 patients (100 in each arm) were enrolled in the
study. out of 200 patients, 193 patients completed the study (96
aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx ; 97 aceclofenac). three patients on
combination and two patients on monotherapy were lost to
follow-up. one patient on combination was discontinued due to
protocol violation and one patient on monotherapy refused further
participation in the study. both treatment groups were comparable
with respect to baseline disease and demographic characteristics
(table 1).

(sd) weight of 49.02 (9.86) kg and mean (sd) height of 154.24
(5.59) cm. menstrual cycles in all participating women were regular
with mean cycle duration of 29.18 (2.46) days, mean menstrual ﬂow
duration of 4.38 (1.03) days and mean of 5.68 (0.58) painful cycles
out of previous six.
3.1. primary efﬁcacy parameters
pain relief, topar/4 and topar/8: fig. 1 shows evolution of painrelief scores over 48 h of treatment. the combination treated group
had signiﬁcantly better pain-relief scores than the monotherapy
group during the ﬁrst 4 h of study medication. these trends in
descriptive statistics were conﬁrmed by student’s t-test, which
showed that topar/4 (24.0  10.52 vs 18.54  9.52) and topar/8
(40.3  12.3 vs 35.2  10.9) varied signiﬁcantly between treatments
indicating favorable efﬁcacy of combination over monotherapy
(table 2).
3.2. secondary efﬁcacy parameters
pid from baseline to all subsequent time points: both treatment
groups reported a signiﬁcant fall in pain-intensity score from
baseline. the pid was signiﬁcantly better with the combination
from 30 min after dosing. it is observed that during the ﬁrst 4 h,
there was a signiﬁcantly greater fall in pain-intensity scores of
patients treated with combination therapy as compared to
monotherapy (p < 0.001). from 8 h onwards both treatment
reduced pain-intensity to a similar extent (p > 0.05) (fig. 2).
spid over 4 and 8 h: the overall pain-intensity reduction was
assessed by summing all differences relative to baseline at all
measurement time points over 4 and 8 h. pain intensity was
statistically different between the two groups. the combination
was more effective at reducing overall pain-intensity as compared
to monotherapy (p < 0.05) (table 2).

peak pid over 4 and 8 h: the maximum change in pain-intensity
over the 4 h period recorded for each patient varied signiﬁcantly
between the treatment groups. peak pid in the combination group
was signiﬁcantly more than with monotherapy (p = 0.001). at 8 h,
the peak pid was more in combination-treated patients as
compared to the monotherapy group (p = 0.384) (table 2).
peak pr over 4 and 8 h: the peak pr achieved over a 4 h period by
each patient varied signiﬁcantly between the treatment groups.
peak pr in the combination group was signiﬁcantly more than in
monotherapy-treated patients (p < 0.001). however, at 8 h both
treatments were comparable with respect to peak-pr score
(p > 0.05) (table 2).
tablet consumption: the total study drug consumption by
patients treated with combination therapy was less than monotherapy-treated patients (150 vs 168 doses). 89.5% of patients were
relieved with two doses of combination while 82.2% of patients
were relieved with two doses of monotherapy. ten patients on
combination required more than two doses of study medication as
compared to 17 patients on monotherapy.
patient’s global evaluation of treatment effectiveness: subject’s
perception of drug effectiveness varied between treatment groups.
signiﬁcantly more women rated the effectiveness of their
treatment as ‘‘excellent-to-very-good’’ in the combination therapy
as compared to monotherapy (p = 0.002). the aceclofenac–
 xxxd1947xxx  combination was rated as excellent-to-very-good in
91.67% of patients as compared with 75.26% of patients in the
aceclofenac group (fig. 3).
investigator’s global evaluation of treatment effectiveness: in the
investigator’s opinion about global evaluation of effectiveness of
the study medications, the combination was signiﬁcantly better
than aceclofenac monotherapy (p = 0.001). investigators rated the
aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx  combination as ‘‘excellent-to-very-good’’
in 92.71% of patients as compared to 75.25% of patients in the
aceclofenac group (fig. 3).

3.3. safety
all patients enrolled on study were included in safety analysis.
a total of 200 patients were analyzed. a total of 21 patients
(10.50%) reported four aes during this study (table 3). the
commonly reported aes were headache and nausea. the less
common aes were vertigo and skin rash. in the investigator’s
judgment, the reported aes were of mild to moderate intensity and
possibly related to study drugs. all aes subsided on their own. the
incidence of ae with aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx  was similar to that
reported in literature for aceclofenac and  xxxd1947xxx  alone.
4. discussion
this randomized study conﬁrmed the analgesic efﬁcacy of the
aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx  combination when administered orally in
the treatment of pain due to primary dysmenorrhoea. this is the
ﬁrst study to evaluate the efﬁcacy of aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx 
combination in primary dysmenorrhoea. the analgesic usefulness
of aceclofenac in controlling pain due to primary dysmenorrhoea
has been evaluated in a randomized double-blind crossover study
[2]. excessive pg synthesis during menstruation appears to induce
uncoordinated hyperactivity of uterine muscles that leads to
uterine ischemia or spasm. addition of  xxxd1947xxx , a muscle
relaxant can reduce such contraction and spasms [11]. this beneﬁt
of  xxxd1947xxx  was demonstrated in our study as signiﬁcantly more
patients reported resolution of cramps at the end of therapy in the
combination group than in the monotherapy group (95.79% vs
87.23%, p = 0.035).
in this study the aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx  combination provided signiﬁcantly greater pain relief as measured over 4 h (topar/4)
and 8 h (topar/8) periods in comparison with monotherapy.
evaluation of pain intensity at different time points in the present
study allows for characterization of the analgesic effect of the
aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx  combination and provides insight into

90

a. pareek et al. / european journal of obstetrics & gynecology and reproductive biology 152 (2010) 86–90

the clinical relevance of treatment for dysmenorrhoea. differences
in pain intensity between the study treatments began to emerge
from 0.5 h after the dose and plateaued after 8 h. this effect was
signiﬁcantly in favor of the combination. this conﬁrms the
analgesic beneﬁts of adding  xxxd1947xxx  to aceclofenac in
controlling pain due to primary dysmenorrhoea for the period
of 8 h. the spid for the 8 h time-period conﬁrms that women on
combination therapy achieved signiﬁcant overall reduction in pain
intensity as compared to those who received aceclofenac alone.
peak pain intensity was also signiﬁcantly lower and pain
reduction from baseline was considered to be satisfactory with
combination therapy as compared to monotherapy. signiﬁcantly
more patients treated with combination reported more than 50%
reduction in their baseline pi-nrs score at period of 4 h
[93(96.87%) vs 79(81.44%)] (p = 0.001).
peak-pr scores have been extensively used in studies of pain
evaluation. in the present study, peak-pr scores were signiﬁcantly
better with aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx  as compared to aceclofenac
alone.
both study medications were well tolerated. no serious adverse
events were reported during this study. no signiﬁcant drug-related
changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, blood biochemistry or
hematology were observed with the study treatments. although
the majority of patients reported headache as an ae, this was
similar to that reported in literature for aceclofenac [2]. the
combination of aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx  was well tolerated and
the tolerability proﬁle was similar to that reported in literature
when these drug were administered separately [2,10].
5. conclusion
this study establishes the efﬁcacy of aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx 
combination in patients with primary dysmenorrhoea. addition of
 xxxd1947xxx  to aceclofenac provides signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁts in relieving pain associated with primary dysmenorrhoea. the
ﬁxed-dose combination of aceclofenac– xxxd1947xxx  should therefore be considered as effective and well tolerated treatment for
primary dysmenorrhoea.
