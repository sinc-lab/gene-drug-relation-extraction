abstract
monocytes release  xxxg1168xxx  after activation by lipopolysaccharide/atp. since inflammatory conditions such as sepsis are
characterized by augmented  xxxg1168xxx  in sera of patients, we sought to modulate lipopolysaccharide/atp-induced  xxxg1168xxx  release
by pharmacological means. here we report that 1-[n,o-bis(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-n-methyl-l-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine (kn-62), an
inhibitor of atp-mediated cellular activation by the purinoreceptor subtype p2x7, potently suppresses  xxxg1168xxx  release from peripheral
blood mononuclear cells.  xxxg1168xxx  liberation was likewise inhibited by  xxxd2215xxx , a modulator of ion transport and inhibitor of atpbinding cassette transporter 1. the data presented herein indicate that by pharmacologically interfering with the process of cytokine secretion
agents such as kn-62 or  xxxd2215xxx  have the potential to curb overproduction of  xxxg1168xxx  in septic patients.

1. introduction
 xxxg1168xxx  is a pro-inflammatory member of the interleukin-1 family of cytokines, shares several biological properties with interleukin-1h, and is a pivotal mediator of
interferon-g production (dinarello, 1996; gracie et al.,
2003). however, in contrast to interleukin-1h and tumor
necrosis factor-a,  xxxg1168xxx  is constitutively expressed
in a variety of cell types among them peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (puren et al., 1999). this characteristic
together with the ability of  xxxg1168xxx  to mediate production of  xxxg2296xxx -a and interleukin-1h (puren et
al., 1998) suggests that  xxxg1168xxx  is located at a rather
proximal position in the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade.
therefore, blockage of  xxxg1168xxx  bioactivity has the
potential to become a key component of anti-cytokine strategies (dinarello, 2000). in fact, enhanced levels of  xxxg1168xxx  have been associated with human diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis (yamamura et al., 2001), type 1 diabetes

(nicoletti et al., 2001a), multiple sclerosis (nicoletti et al.,
2001b), myasthenia gravis (jander and stoll, 2002), crohn’s
disease (pizarro et al., 1999), and septic shock syndrome
(grobmyer et al., 2000). suppression of  xxxg1168xxx  bioactivity is protective in the respective animal models of these
immunoinflammatory/autoimmune diseases (plater-zyberk
et al., 2001; nicoletti et al., 2003; wildbaum et al., 1998;
im et al., 2001; siegmund et al., 2001; ten hove et al., 2001;
netea et al., 2000). accordingly, recent reports demonstrate
the anti-inflammatory potential of  xxxg1168xxx  blockage by
use of  xxxg1168xxx  binding protein in human whole blood
cultures (stuyt et al., 2001; nold et al., 2003).
previous studies suggest that release of  xxxg1168xxx 
from human monocytes is a rather inefficient process. actually, induction of  xxxg1168xxx  secretion was not detected in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (puren et al., 1999). in contrast, induction of release
of pro- and mature  xxxg1168xxx  from monocytes can be
achieved by incubation with the combination lipopolysaccharide plus atp (3 mm). this process is mediated by
binding of atp to the purinoreceptor subtype p2x7 and
associated with  xxxg340xxx  activation (metha et al., 2001).
accordingly, lipopolysaccharide/atp-induced secretion of
interleukin-1h ex vivo is completely suppressed in whole

326

blood cultures obtained from p2x7 knockout mice (labasi et
al., 2002). prolonged activation of p2x7 triggers pore formation and cell death in monocytic cells (di virgilio et al.,
1998). cellular mechanisms that initiate release of interleukin-1h from monocytes may likewise apply to  xxxg1168xxx .
therefore, effects of two well-characterized inhibitors of
lipopolysaccharide/atp-induced interleukin-1h release
(hamon et al., 1997; grahames et al., 1999) were investigated
with regard to their effects on  xxxg1168xxx  secretion.
specifically, we analyzed the modulatory potential of 1[n,o-bis(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-n-methyl- l -tyrosyl]-4phenylpiperazine (kn-62), a potent antagonist of p2x7 activation (humphreys et al., 1998; grahames et al., 1999;
eschke et al., 2002). since il-18, like il-1h, lacks a signal
peptide (dinarello, 1996; gracie et al., 2003) and its secretion
may thus involve the action of atp-binding cassette (abc)
transporters, we also investigated effects of  xxxd2215xxx , a

 xxxg1232xxx  blocker and inhibitor of  xxxg22xxx 
1 (hamon et al., 1997).

2. materials and methods
lipopolysaccharide (e. coli serotype 0127:b8) and atp
were from sigma (deisenhofen, germany).  xxxd2215xxx  and
kn-62 were from calbiochem (schwalbach, germany). the
study protocol and consent documents were approved by the
ethik kommission of the klinikum der johann wolfgang
goethe-universität, frankfurt am main. healthy volunteers
abstained from using any drugs during 2 weeks before the
study. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were freshly
isolated from heparanized blood as described and incubated
at the indicated cell-density in rpmi 1640 supplemented
with 25 mm hepes, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 ag/ml

fig. 1. kn-62 and  xxxd2215xxx  inhibit lipopolysaccharide/atp-induced  xxxg1168xxx  release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells were seeded at 5  106 cells/ml (abd) or at 3  106 cells/ml (c) and stimulated with the combination lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml)/atp
(3 mm) for either 2 h (acd) or 24 h (b). peripheral blood mononuclear cells were coincubated with either kn-62 or  xxxd2215xxx . kn-62 or  xxxd2215xxx  were either
used at the indicated concentrations (abc), or with kn-62 at 3 am or  xxxd2215xxx  at 100 am (d).  xxxd2215xxx  (2 h) and kn-62 (10 min) were applied before the
addition of lipopolysaccharide/atp. il-18 concentrations in cell-free supernatants were determined by elisa. data are expressed as mean  xxxg1168xxx 
concentrations f s.e.m. (n = 3 for (ac) or n = 4 for (b)). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 compared to untreated control; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 compared to peripheral
blood mononuclear cells treated with lipopolysaccharide/atp alone. vehicle control (0.06% dmso) did not significantly affect  xxxg1168xxx  release in
response to lipopolysaccharide/atp (348.9 f 50.6 pg/ml versus 394.8 f 62.8 pg/ml for lipopolysaccharide/atp versus lipopolysaccharide/atp (dmso at
0.06%), 2 h stimulation, n = 3). (d) cell lysates from experiments performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two different donors were analyzed
for intracellular il-18 content by immunoblot analysis. in accord with previous data (mehta et al., 2001), only pro- xxxg1168xxx  was detectable in cell extract,
independent of the conditions investigated.

streptomycin (gibco-brl, eggenstein, germany), and 1%
(v/v) heat-inactivated human ab serum (sigma) (nold et al.,
2003). after the indicated incubation periods,  xxxg1168xxx 
was quantified in cell-free supernatants by enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa) (diaclone, hölzel diagnostika, köln, germany). this elisa detects pro- and mature
 xxxg1168xxx . to determine intracellular levels of  xxxg1168xxx , peripheral blood mononuclear cells were lysed (300
mm nacl, 50 mm tris – cl, ph 7.6, 0.5% triton x-100,
supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail, roche molecular biochemicals) and 70 ag of total protein were used to
perform immunoblot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal antiinterleukin-18 antibody (peprotech ec, london, uk).
elisa data were analyzed by paired student’s t-test on
raw data using sigma plot (jandel scientific).

3. results
in accord with recent publications, we observed release
of  xxxg1168xxx  from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
exposed to lipolysaccharide/atp (perregaux et al., 2000;
mehta et al., 2001) (fig. 1a,b,c). furthermore, we confirm
that  xxxg1168xxx  is constitutively expressed in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (fig. 1d) and that secretion induced by lipopolysaccharide/atp is a fast process. in fact,
there was no significant difference with regard to lipopolysaccharide/atp-induced  xxxg1168xxx  levels in cell culture
supernatants from experiments with incubation periods of 2
or 24 h, respectively (fig. 1a and b). secretion of  xxxg1168xxx  in response to lipopolysaccharide/atp was potently
suppressed by coincubation with kn-62 (fig. 1a and b) or
 xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 1c). the obtained dose – response curves for
both agents agree with those previously reported for inhibition of lipopolysaccharide/atp-induced interleukin-1h
(hamon et al., 1997; grahames et al., 1999). secretion of
 xxxg1168xxx  in response to lipopolysaccharide/atp coincided with depletion of intracellular pro- xxxg1168xxx  as
detected by immunoblot analysis. in agreement with the
elisa data on  xxxg1168xxx  secretion (fig. 1a,b,c), we
observed that coincubation with kn-62 or  xxxd2215xxx  was
able to inhibit depletion of intracellular  xxxg1168xxx  in
response to lipopolysaccharide/atp (fig. 1d).

327

suppression of lipopolysaccharide/atp-induced interleukin18 secretion by the p2x7 antagonist kn-62 and by  xxxd2215xxx ,
a potent inhibitor of atp-sensitive k+-channels and of the
 xxxg22xxx  1 (hamon et al., 1997). these pharmacological data underscore the current view that maturation,
processing, and release of interleukin-1h and  xxxg1168xxx 
are mediated by rather similar molecular mechanisms.
besides being a potent inhibitor of p2x7, kn-62 is also a
recognized inhibitor of calmodulin kinase ii (williams et al.,
1996). therefore, we cannot fully exclude the possibility
that this activity may contribute to effects of kn-62 on
release of interleukin-1h and  xxxg1168xxx . however, data
that relate atp to interleukin-1h/ xxxg1168xxx  secretion
and p2x7 activation are strong (perregaux and gabel, 1994;
mehta et al., 2001; labasi et al., 2002) and potent inhibition
of p2x7 function by kn-62 is a well-established observation
(humphreys et al., 1998; grahames et al., 1999; eschke et
al., 2002). thus, p2x7 antagonism imposes as prime mechanism of the inhibitory action of kn-62 described herein.
the present and previous data suggest that by targeting
the process of cytokine release pharmacological agents such
as kn-62 and  xxxd2215xxx  have the potential to inhibit
bioactivity of both, interleukin-1h and  xxxg1168xxx . simultaneous inhibition of these two cytokines may be desired
with regard to anti-cytokine strategies in the context of
chronic inflammation and septic shock. in fact, expression
of p2x7 is upregulated by pro-inflammatory stimuli like
lipopolysaccharide/interferon-g (humphreys and dubyak,
1996). the significance of atp signaling via the p2x7
receptor in an inflammatory setting is furthermore highlighted by the observation that p2x7 knockout mice show
greatly reduced lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammatory
responses in a model of experimental arthritis (labasi et al.,
2002). taken together, p2x7 antagonism or modulation of
abc type of transporters by pharmacological means may
represent promising strategies that target  xxxg1168xxx 
secretion and thus have the potential to interfere with the
pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade at a rather proximal
position.

4. discussion
biochemical events that mediate release of interleukin1h and  xxxg1168xxx  from lipopolysaccharide/atp-activated monocytes are still poorly understood but clearly include
activation of p2x7 receptors (buell et al., 1998; solle et al.,
2001). furthermore, this process appears to involve a p2x7mediated k+efflux, an activation of  xxxg340xxx  (perregaux
and gabel, 1994; di virgilio et al., 1998; mehta et al.,
2001), and the activity of  xxxg22xxx  1 (hamon et al.,
1997). in the present study, we demonstrate for the first time
