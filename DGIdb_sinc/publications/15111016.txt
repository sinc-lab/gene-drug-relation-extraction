abstract
although the mechanism of action of topiramate is not fully understood, its anticonvulsant properties may result, at least in
part, from an interaction with ampa/kainate receptors. we have recently shown that topiramate selectively inhibits postsynaptic
responses mediated by  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors. to determine if this action of topiramate is relevant to the anticonvulsant eﬀects
of the drug in vivo, we determined the protective activity of topiramate against seizures induced by intravenous infusion of various ionotropic  xxxg981xxx  agonists in mice. topiramate (25–100 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a dose-dependent elevation in the
threshold for clonic seizures induced by infusion of atpa, a selective agonist of  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors. topiramate was less
eﬀective in protecting against clonic seizures induced by kainate, a mixed agonist of ampa and kainate receptors. topiramate
did not aﬀect clonic seizures induced by ampa or nmda. in contrast, the thresholds for tonic seizures induced by higher doses
of these various  xxxg981xxx  agonists were all elevated by topiramate. unlike topiramate, carbamazepine elevated the
threshold for ampa- but not atpa-induced clonic seizures. our results are consistent with the possibility that the eﬀects of
topiramate on clonic seizure activity are due to functional blockade of  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors. protection from tonic seizures
may be mediated by other actions of the drug. together with our in vitro cellular electrophysiological results, the present observations strongly support a unique mechanism of action of topiramate, which involves  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors.

1. introduction
topiramate is one of several newer antiepileptic
drugs (aeds) that were introduced in the 1990s. the
drug is eﬀective against both partial and generalized
seizures, and may also be useful in some intractable
childhood epilepsies (bazil, 2002; deckers et al., 2003).
in addition, topiramate may be beneﬁcial in the treatment of a host of neuropsychiatric syndromes including bipolar disorder (ernst and goldberg, 2003),
migraine (von seggern et al., 2002), neuropathic pain
(chong and libretto, 2003) and alcohol dependence
(johnson et al., 2003). topiramate’s neuroprotective
properties in experimental models make it a potential

candidate for stroke treatment (edmonds et al., 2001;
smith-swintosky et al., 2001; angehagen et al., 2003b).
as a sulfamate derivative of the naturally occurring
monosaccharide d-fructose, topiramate is structurally
distinct from other aeds. the spectrum of pharmacological actions of topiramate is also diﬀerent from
those of other aeds (shank et al., 1994, 2000). while
the cellular mechanisms underlying the anticonvulsant
activity of topiramate are not fully deﬁned, the drug
has several actions that could account for its antiepileptic eﬃcacy, including inhibitory eﬀects on
ampa/kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors
(gibbs et al., 2000; skradski and white, 2000), blockade of voltage-activated na+ (zona et al., 1997;
taverna et al., 1999) and ca2+ channels (zhang et al.,
2000), and positive modulatory eﬀects on gabaa
receptors (white et al., 1997, 2000). in addition, topiramate inhibits carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes (dodgson et al., 2000), although this action is not believed to

1098

contribute to its clinical eﬃcacy. it has been hypothesized that the eﬀects of topiramate on the various
receptors and ion channels that it modulates may be
mediated by a common mechanism related to protein
phosphorylation (shank et al., 2000; angehagen et al.,
2003a).
topiramate is the only marketed aed that inhibits
ampa/kainate receptor currents at clinically relevant
concentrations (rogawski, 2002). the initial discovery
that topiramate blocks ampa/kainate receptors was
based on studies with the nonselective agonist kainate
in cultured neurons (gibbs et al., 2000). more recently,
we have found that topiramate selectively inhibits
 xxxg958xxx  currents in the amygdala slice,
and is relatively weaker and less eﬃcacious as an
antagonist of  xxxg981xxx  currents (gryder and
rogawski, 2003). in the present study, we sought to
determine if the selectivity of topiramate at the synaptic level in in vitro slice recordings is relevant to the
anticonvulsant eﬀects of the drug in vivo. it has been
observed that pharmacological antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors selectively block seizures
induced by administration of excitatory amino acids
that activate the relevant receptors (singh et al., 1991;
steppuhn and turski, 1993). accordingly, we determined the protective activity of topiramate against
seizures induced by intravenous infusion in mice of
various ionotropic  xxxg981xxx  agonists, including
(rs)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol4-yl) xxxd3029xxx  (atpa), a selective agonist of
 xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors (arnt et al., 1995; clarke
et al., 1997). our results are consistent with the concept
that the in vivo anticonvulsant activity of topiramate is
mediated, at least in part, by eﬀects on  xxxg958xxx  kainate
receptors.

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
male nih swiss mice, weighing 25–30 g, were
housed ﬁve per cage with free access to food and water
v
in a vivarium with controlled temperature (22–26 c),
humidity (40–50%) and lighting (artiﬁcial 12 h light/
dark cycle). all animals were allowed to acclimate for
at least 5 days before testing. the experiments were
performed during the light cycle after at least 30 min
acclimation to the experimental room. the animal
facilities were fully accredited by the american association for accreditation of laboratory animal care
and the experiments were performed under a protocol
approved by the national institute of neurological
disorders and stroke animal care and use committee, in full compliance with the guide for care and use
of laboratory animals of the national research

council (national academy press, washington, dc,
1966).
2.2. drugs
the following convulsant substances were used: (i)
(rs)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl) xxxd3029xxx  (atpa); (ii) (rs)-a-amino-3-hydroxy5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid hydrobromide
(ampa); (iii) n-methyl-d- xxxd233xxx  (nmda); (iv)
kainic acid [kainate; (2s,3s,4r)-carboxy-4-(1-methylethenyl)-3-pyrrolidineacetic acid]. atpa and ampa
were from tocris (ellisville, mo), nmda was from
rbi (natick, ma), and kainate was from sigma
(st. louis, mo). ampa, nmda and kainate were
dissolved in phosphate buﬀered saline (pbs). atpa
was dissolved in a 5% solution of b-cyclodextrin
(cdt inc., high springs, fl) in pbs. topiramate
[2,3:4,5-bis-o-(1-methyl-ethylidene)-36-d-fructopyranose
sulfamate], kindly provided by johnson & johnson
pharmaceutical research and development (spring
house, pa), and carbamazepine (sigma) were dissolved in a 25% aqueous solution of  xxxd2982xxx  (sigma).
2.3. intravenous catheterization and infusion of
 xxxg981xxx  agonists
each mouse was placed in a rotating tail injector
(braintree scientiﬁc, braintree, ma), which is a plastic
cylinder (4.5-in. long, 1.2-in. inner diameter) with a
plunger for restraint. lidocaine was applied on the tail
before catheterization to decrease pain during the procedure and the lateral tail vein was catheterized with a
0.5-in. long 30-gauge needle attached to a 12-in. length
of polyethylene tubing (pe-10). correct needle placement was veriﬁed by the appearance of blood in the
tubing. the needle was gently secured to the tail using
plastic tape. the tubing was attached to a 12-ml plastic
syringe containing the convulsant solutions. the syringe was mounted on an infusion pump (harvard
apparatus, south natick, ma). following catheterization, unrestrained mice were placed in plexiglas cages
(11 in:  8 in:  6 in:) for behavioral observation during the infusion. the infusion rate was 0.5 ml/min and
the concentrations of all the  xxxg981xxx  agonists were 0.025 mmol/ml. these parameters, chosen
from among those previously shown to permit reliable
assessment of the seizure threshold (steppuhn and
turski, 1993), minimized the infusion time, thus limiting the discomfort. topiramate or carbamazepine (0.01
ml/g body weight) were injected i.p. 30 min before
infusion of the convulsant substances.

2.4. assessment of seizure threshold

2.5. data analysis

two signs of seizure activity that typically occur in
sequence during agonist infusion were used to determine
the threshold for seizure induction: (i) clonus (repeated
jerking movements of all four limbs) with loss of the
righting reﬂex, and (ii) tonic hindlimb extension. the
times between the start of the infusion and the onset of
these endpoints were recorded. the threshold doses
(td) of the  xxxg981xxx  agonists (in mmol/kg)
for each endpoint were calculated as follows:
td ¼ ðinfusion duration ½s  infusion rate ½ml=min
drug concentration ½mg=ml  1000þ=ð60 ½s  weight
of mouse ½g  molecular weightþ. our protocol permitted a maximum infusion time of 4 min, but the
infusion times required to reach both seizure signs
never exceeded 3.5 min (except for nmda where some
animals did not exhibit tonic seizure activity).

the mean td values in treatment groups [taken to
be an estimate of the convulsant dose for 50% of animals ( xxxg1128xxx )] were compared using one-way analysis of
variance (anova) for each seizure endpoint, followed, when appropriate, by dunnett’s test, or in cases
where there were only two groups to compare, using
the unpaired student’s t-test. for graphical display
(fig. 1), td values in each group are plotted against
the cumulative fraction of animals in that group exhibiting the seizure sign at equal or lower doses. the
data points are ﬁt to the following approximation of
a cumulative normal distribution f ¼ 50[1 + erf
p
(td   xxxg1128xxx  )/ 2r], where f is the fraction of animals
(in percent) and  xxxg1128xxx  and r are the mean and standard deviation with the r value constrained to be equal
for the clonus and tonus data sets.

fig. 1. induction of clonic and tonic seizure activity by  xxxg981xxx  agonists. atpa (a), ampa (b), kainate (c) or nmda (d) was
infused (0.5 ml/min) through the lateral tail vein at a concentration of 0.025 mmol/ml. during the infusion, mice exhibited clonic convulsions
(clonus) which progressed to tonic hindlimb extension (tonus). the dose at which each of 7–11 animals tested per group exhibited the seizure signs
was calculated from the time of infusion and is plotted in a cumulative fashion as a percent of total number of animals tested. two of the animals
treated with nmda exhibited clonic seizures only prior to expiring. the data points are ﬁt to a cumulative normal distribution function as
described in ‘‘materials and methods’’. the  xxxg1128xxx  values derived from these data are presented in table 1.

potencies of topiramate for antagonizing seizure
signs induced by the various agonists were compared
by estimating a dose of topiramate expected to produce
a theoretical (not necessarily achievable) doubling of
the agonist  xxxg1128xxx  value (a2). ratios of agonist  xxxg1128xxx 
values in the presence and absence of topiramate (r)
were calculated and log10 (r  1) was plotted against
the log10 (topiramate dose). a2 was then taken to be
10b/m where b is the y-intercept and m is the slope of
the best-ﬁt straight line. in this analysis, only the rising
phase of the dose–response curves was considered.
3. results
intravenous injection of all four  xxxg981xxx 
agonists induced a sequence of clonus followed by
tonus. for atpa, kainate and nmda the latencies
for the clonic and tonic phases were 50–150 and 130–
170 s; for ampa the corresponding latencies were 40–
65 and 55–80 s. molar doses of the agonists associated
with each endpoint were determined from the latencies
as described in ‘‘materials and methods’’. threshold
values for the agonists are presented in fig. 1 and
 xxxg1128xxx  values derived from these data are given in
table 1. it is noteworthy that all four agonists have
molar potencies within the same range, although
ampa is modestly more potent. in addition, the  xxxg1128xxx 
values for clonus are in all cases signiﬁcantly lower
than those for tonus, except for nmda, which
induced tonus at nearly the same dose range as clonus.
in contrast to the other agonists that invariably elicited
tonic seizure activity with increased agonist doses, only
ﬁve of seven animals treated with nmda exhibited
tonus. the remainder expired as the dose of nmda
was increased without demonstrating tonus.
topiramate was tested for its ability to protect
against clonic and tonic convulsions by determining the
thresholds for the two behavioral signs after pretreatment with the drug. as shown in fig. 2a, pretreatment
with topiramate at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg
caused a dose-dependent increase in the thresholds for
atpa-induced clonic [f ð3; 25þ ¼ 5:7; p ¼ 0:005] and

pretreated with topiramate at 50 and 100 mg/kg had

seizures as compared with vehicle-pretreated animals
(p < 0:05; dunnett’s test). in contrast, the thresholds
for

remained
unchanged after topiramate (25–100 mg/kg) pretreatment [f ð3; 25þ ¼ 1:25; p ¼ 0:3], although the thresholds
for tonic seizures were increased [f ð3; 25þ ¼ 6:2;
p ¼ 0:003] (fig. 2b). while topiramate raised the
threshold for tonic seizures in comparison with vehicle
at all doses tested (p < 0:05; dunnett’s test), the eﬀect
was not dose-dependent.
topiramate pretreatment (50–200 mg/kg) caused a
small, but signiﬁcant, increase in the threshold for kainate-induced clonic seizures [(f ð4; 36þ ¼ 3:0; p ¼ 0:033]
(fig. 2c). the threshold for tonic seizures was more
strongly aﬀected [f ð4; 36þ ¼ 9:5; p < 0:001)]. for both
tonic and clonic kainate-induced seizures, topiramate
exhibited an inverted u-shaped dose–response curve
with a reduction in activity at the highest doses tested.
similar reductions in topiramate eﬃcacy at higher
doses have been observed previously in other models
(r.p. shank, personal communication). for clonic seizures, only the eﬀects at the 50 and 100 mg/kg doses
reached statistical signiﬁcance (p < 0:05; dunnett’s
test), whereas for tonic seizures signiﬁcant eﬀects were
obtained at 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg.
topiramate pretreatment did not aﬀect the threshold
for nmda-induced clonic seizures [(f ð3; 24þ ¼ 0:16;
p ¼ 0:9] (fig. 2d). however, it completely prevented
the occurrence of nmda-induced tonic seizures at all
doses tested; the animals expired as the nmda
infusion continued without exhibiting tonus.
the estimated doses of topiramate for producing a
two-fold increase in tonic seizure threshold (a2) are
210, 210, 200 mg/kg for atpa, ampa and kainate,
respectively, demonstrating a nearly identical sensitivity
of the tonic seizures irrespective of the agonist. (an
estimate of tonic-seizure a2 value for nmda was not
attempted since tonic seizures were not always
observed, even with vehicle pretreatment.) in contrast,
for the clonic seizure endpoint, only atpa exhibited a
rising topiramate dose–response relationship for mean
threshold values that diﬀered signiﬁcantly from vehicle;
its a2 value was 315 mg/kg.
to conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of topiramate, studies were
carried out with the reference aed carbamazepine at a
dose (20 mg/kg) that is eﬀective in anticonvulsant
screening models (swinyard et al., 1989). as shown in
fig. 3a, pretreatment with this dose of carabamazepine did not raise the threshold for atpainduced clonic seizures, although it provided complete
protection against tonic seizures. in contrast, carbamazepine signiﬁcantly raised the threshold for both
ampa-induced clonic seizures and tonic seizures

fig. 2. eﬀects of topiramate on convulsant thresholds of  xxxg981xxx  agonists. atpa (a), ampa (b), kainate (c) or nmda (d) was
infused (0.5 ml/min) through the lateral tail vein at a concentration of 0.025 mmol/ml. vehicle or topiramate at the doses indicated was injected
i.p. 30 min before the start of infusion. during the infusion, mice exhibited clonic convulsions (clonus) which progressed to tonic hindlimb extension (tonus), except for some animals receiving nmda (two of seven vehicle-pretreated animals did not exhibit tonus and were not included in
the calculation of the threshold and none of the topiramate-pretreated animals exhibited tonus). animals receiving nmda generally died within
2–3 min of the onset of the nmda infusion, but in two of ﬁve mice treated with 100 mg/kg topiramate, the mice survived the maximum 4-min
infusion time without tonus. the threshold dose for each seizure endpoint was calculated from the infusion duration (see ‘‘materials and methods’’). each bar represents the mean sem of the threshold values (cd50s) from 5 to 11 animals. for each agonist, the  xxxg1128xxx  values were compared using one-way analysis of variance (anova) followed, when appropriate, by dunnett’s test. signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from vehicle (p < 0:05).

(fig. 3b). the threshold for kainate-induced clonic seizures was also raised, but this did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance, whereas there was a signiﬁcant elevation
of the tonic seizure threshold (fig. 3c). carbamazepine
did not raise the clonic seizure threshold for nmda
but it did eliminate tonic seizures (fig. 3d).

4. discussion
the key experimental observation in this study is
that clonic seizures induced by the selective  xxxg958xxx  agonist atpa were blocked in a dosedependent fashion by topiramate. topiramate was also
protective against clonic seizures induced by the mixed
ampa/kainate receptor agonist kainate. the drug did
not aﬀect clonic seizures induced by ampa which is
only very weakly active as a kainate receptor agonist
(fletcher and lodge, 1996) and nmda which does
not act as a kainate receptor agonist. these results
strongly support the conclusion, developed from in
vitro cellular neurophysiological studies (gryder and
rogawski, 2003), that topiramate acts as a potent func-

tional antagonist of  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors and
demonstrates that this in vitro activity is relevant to the
anticonvulsant activity of the drug in vivo.
atpa is a tert-butyl analog of ampa originally
reported to have weak  xxxg981xxx  agonist activity
(lauridsen et al., 1985; bleakman et al., 2002). however, more recent studies revealed that atpa is a far
more potent agonist at homomerically (clarke et al.,
1997) and heteromerically (cui and mayer, 1999)
expressed  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors. indeed, atpa is
29–94% less potent as an agonist of homomeric ampa
receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes and only 7–22%
as eﬃcacious for activating ionic currents (stensbøl
et al., 1999). inasmuch as topiramate failed to aﬀect
clonic seizures induced by intravenous ampa, a selective agonist of ampa receptors that induces desensitizing responses (fletcher and lodge, 1996), our results
support the idea that the convulsant activity of atpa
at doses just suﬃcient to produce clonic seizures largely
resides in its  xxxg958xxx  agonist activity
and not in its weak  xxxg981xxx  activity.
kainate is a nonselective agonist of kainate-type glutamate receptors, which, unlike atpa, activates kai-

nate receptors containing both of the major low-aﬃnity
kainate receptor subunits  xxxg958xxx  and  xxxg959xxx  (sommer
et al., 1992). in addition, kainate activates ampa
receptor responses (chittajallu et al., 1999). although
kainate is substantially less potent as an agonist at
ampa receptors than at kainate receptors, it is functionally highly active at ampa receptors because the
responses it induces are non-desensitizing (boulter
et al., 1990; stein et al., 1992; fletcher and lodge,
1996). the identity of the kainate receptors relevant to
the convulsant activity of kainate has been assessed in
studies with mice engineered to lack either the  xxxg958xxx 
or  xxxg959xxx  kainate receptor subunits (mulle et al.,
1998). these studies support the view that kainate
receptors containing the  xxxg959xxx  subunit contribute in a
substantial way to the convulsant eﬀects of kainate. in
addition, it is likely that the agonist activity of kainate
at ampa receptors also contributes to kainate-induced
convulsions. topiramate raised the threshold for clonic
seizures induced by kainate, although less dramatically
so than for atpa and the eﬀect was not dose-dependent. this weak activity could be due, in part, to
blockade of kainate receptors by topiramate. since kainate-induced seizures may principally reﬂect activation
of  xxxg959xxx  kainate receptors, our results suggest that

topiramate may block  xxxg959xxx -containing kainate receptors in addition to those containing  xxxg958xxx . to date,
the action of topiramate on  xxxg959xxx  kainate receptors
has not been extensively investigated in in vitro studies:
one preliminary report indicated a weak blocking
action (ghetti et al., 2001), whereas another did not
(smith et al., 2000). the relatively weak eﬀect of topiramate against kainate-induced seizures (compared with
the eﬀect on atpa) could therefore be due to its lower
activity against  xxxg959xxx  containing kainate receptors
than  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors, a point that requires
further conﬁrmation, or to its low potency and eﬃcacy
as an antagonist of ampa receptors (gryder and
rogawski, 2003). in fact, in the present study topiramate failed to aﬀect clonic seizures induced by
ampa, supporting the in vitro studies showing insubstantial  xxxg981xxx  blocking activity (gryder and
rogawski, 2003). the lack of eﬀect of topiramate on
nmda-induced clonic seizures is in line with a report
showing that the drug does not aﬀect nmda receptor
currents in neuronal cultures (gibbs et al., 2000).
although clonic convulsions emerged as the ﬁrst
seizure sign during intravenous infusion of all four  xxxg981xxx  agonists, there was progression, with
higher doses, to tonic hindlimb extension. the evolution from clonic to tonic seizures reﬂects the spread of
paroxysmal activity into subcortical forebrain and
brain stem structures (gale, 1988). the tonic seizures
induced by all agonists were inhibited by topiramate.
as noted above, while topiramate is particularly potent
as an antagonist of  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors, it does
partially inhibit ampa receptors at higher concentrations (gryder and rogawski, 2003). therefore, the
ability of topiramate to protect against tonic seizure
activity could relate to its weak  xxxg981xxx  blocking activity. ampa, kainate, and atpa at suﬃciently
high doses all directly activate ampa receptors. moreover, ampa receptors are likely to be critical in the
propagation of seizure activity (rogawski and donevan, 1999; avanzini and franceschetti, 2003). blockade
of ampa receptors might therefore protect against the
spread of seizure activity resulting in tonic hindlimb
extension, even if they are triggered by an agonist like
nmda that does not directly activate ampa receptors. alternatively, other actions of topiramate could
speciﬁcally inhibit tonic seizure activity. for example,
topiramate has been shown to have eﬀects on voltageactivated na+ channels (zona et al., 1997; taverna
et al., 1999), like several other antiepileptic agents that
are well recognized to block tonic hindlimb extension
(rogawski, 2002).
we carried out comparative studies with the aed
carbamazepine to determine whether selective eﬀects on
atpa and not ampa-induced clonic seizures is a
unique characteristic of topiramate. indeed, carbamazepine has previously been shown to raise the threshold

r.m. kaminski et al. / neuropharmacology 46 (2004) 1097–1104

for seizures induced by infusion of atpa (steppuhn
and turski, 1993) and ampa (yamashita et al., 2004)
into the mouse lateral ventricle. however, we found
that carbamazepine did not aﬀect the threshold for clonic seizures induced by systemic atpa at a dose that
was highly eﬀective in raising the threshold for ampainduced clonic seizures. consequently, carbamazepine,
in contrast to topiramate, does not act as a selective
functional  xxxg958xxx  antagonist, highlighting the novel pharmacological activity of topiramate.
in conclusion, by assessing blockade of seizure
activity induced by intravenous administration of ionotropic  xxxg981xxx  agonists, we have obtained
support for the concept that topiramate selectively
inhibits  xxxg958xxx  responses in vivo. the
doses of topiramate that protect against atpainduced clonic seizure are similar to those that are
eﬀective in other seizure models in the mouse; such
doses are believed to be associated with blood concentrations comparable to those obtained in humans
receiving therapeutic doses of the drug (r.p. shank,
personal communication). consequently, blockade of
 xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors could in part be responsible
for topiramate’s broad clinical anticonvulsant eﬃcacy
as well as its beneﬁcial eﬀects in non-epileptic conditions. other actions, including those on na+ channels, are also likely to contribute to the overall
eﬀectiveness of topiramate. nevertheless, the present
results add to the emerging evidence that  xxxg958xxx  kainate receptors are a promising novel target for aed
development (smolders et al., 2002; rogawski et al.,
2003).
