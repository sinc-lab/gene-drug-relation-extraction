and a2 adenosine receptors

u. schwabe, d. ukena, and m. j. lohse

pharmakologisches institut der universit/it heidelberg, im neuenheimer feld 366, d-6900 heidelberg, federal republic of germany
summary. a variety of alkylxanthines has been comparatively examined as antagonists of a1 adenosine receptors in rat fat cells, rat and bovine cerebral cortex and
of a2 adenosine receptors in human platelets. with few
exceptions all xanthine derivatives with 7-position substituents such as  xxxd1958xxx ,  xxxd3038xxx ,  xxxd2880xxx 
and etofylline were less potent antagonists than xanthine
itself which had ki-values of 170 gmol/1 (a1) and 93 ~tmol/1
(a2). theophylline, caffeine and 3-isobutym-methylxanthine were more potent than xanthine but nearly equipotent
antagonists at both receptor subtypes. 8-phenyl substituents
considerably increased the antagonist potency at a1 and
a2 receptors. 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine was the most
potent az antagonist (ki 0.2 gmol/1) in human platelets. at
a1 receptors 1,3-dipropyl-8-(2-amino-4-chlorophenyl)xanthine (pacpx) was the most potent antagonist in all three
tissues with ki-values from 0.3 to 8.6 nmol/1. several 8phenylxanthine derivatives were remarkably selective
antagonists at a~ receptors. 8-phenyltheophylline was
approximately 700 times more potent as antagonist at a1
receptors (bovine brain) than at a2 receptors (human
platelets), and pacpx was even 1,600 times more potent as
a~ adenosine receptor antagonist. these compounds offer
a possibility for a subtype-selective blockade of adenosine
receptors.

adenylate cyclase -

xanthine derivatives are antagonists at both receptor subtypes. the a1 adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition of
adenylate cyclase is competitively antagonized by theophylline, caffeine and 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine in isolated rat fat cells and rat brain (londos et al. 1978; cooper
et al. 1980). these xanthine derivatives also compete for the
binding of radioligand agonists and antagonists in membrane preparations of bovine brain, rat brain and rat fat
cells (bruns et al. 1980; schwabe and trost 1980; williams
and risley 1980; trost and schwabe 1981). adenosine receptor binding studies have been employed to design highly
potent adenosine receptor antagonists (bruns et al. 1983).
furthermore, it has been demonstrated that a2 receptormediated activation of adenylate cyclase is competitively
blocked by theophylline and caffeine in human platelets
and mouse neuroblastoma cells (haslam and rosson 1975;
blume et al. 1975). in addition, a great number of alkylxanthines and related compounds reverse the adenosine-induced
stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx  formation in human fibroblasts
(bruns 1981).
recently, xanthine derivatives and mesoionic xanthine
analogues have been comparatively investigated in a1 and
az adenosine receptor systems, but markedly selective
antagonists for one of both receptor subtypes were not
obtained (fredholm and persson 1982; glennon et al. 1984).
we have studied a number of recently developed xanthine
derivatives in subtype-selective cell systems and report here
that several 8-phenylxanthine derivatives are selective
antagonists at the inhibitory a1 adenosine receptors. part
of the results have been presented at the spring meeting of
the deutsche pharmakologische gesellschaft 1985 (schwabe
1985).

introduction

the discovery of adenosine receptors resulted in the proposal of a new mechanism of action for theophylline and
related alkylxanthines. for many years these compounds
were believed to act via an inhibition of cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterases, but now it has been recognized that
theophylline and other xanthine derivatives have additional
effects on adenosine receptors and are more potent as adenosine antagonists than as inhibitors of phosphodiesterases
(for review see fredholm 1980; daly 1982).
based on adenylate cyclase studies and radioligand binding data adenosine receptors are subdivided into a1 (ri)
receptors, which mediate an inhibition of adenylate cyclase
activity, and a2 (r,) receptors, which stimulate adenylate
cyclase activity (van calker et al. 1978; londos et al. 1980).

method described by whittaker (1969). male spraguedawley rats ( 1 5 0 - 2 5 0 g) were killed by cervical dislocation,
and the forebrains were quickley removed and immediately
placed in ice-cold 0.32 mol/1 sucrose. bovine brain was
obtained from a local slaugtherhouse and was placed in icecold 0.32 mol/l sucrose within 30 min of slaughter. cerebral
cortex was dissected and the tissue was homogenized at 0~
in a glass-teflon homogenizer in 10 volumes of 0.32 mol/1
sucrose (clearing 0.2 mm, at 500 rpm for 30 s). the homogenate was centrifuged at 1 , 0 0 0 x g for 10min and the
supernatant again centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 30 rain to
give the combined p2 and p3 fractions. the pellets were
resuspended in 10 ml of water, centrifuged at 100,000 x g for
30 rain and washed once with 50 mmol/1 tris-hc1, p h 7.4,
using the same centrifugation step. finally, the membranes
were resuspended in 50 retool/1 tris-hc1, p h 7.4, at a
concentration of 6 - 1 0 mg of protein per ml, frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at - 8 0 ~
protein was measured
according to the method o f lowry et al. (1951).

platelet aggregation. h u m a n platelet-rich plasma was
separated from citrated venous blood by centrifugation at
260 x g for 20 min at r o o m temperature. for measurement
of platelet aggregation, incubation mixtures consisting of
210 ixl platelet-rich plasma (platelet count about 300,000/gl)
and additions of 5'-n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (neca)
and xanthine derivatives in 0.154 retool/1  xxxg2020xxx  were stirred
in a final volume o f 250 ixl at 37~ in an aggregometer
(elvi 840, elvi milano, italy). after preincubation for 3 min
platelet aggregation was initiated by addition of 5 gmol/1
a d p and recorded for 5 min.

adenylate eyclase assay. adenylate cyclase activity of rat fat
cell membranes and human platelet membranes was determined as described by jakobs et al. (1976). the assay medium contained 1 mmol/1 mgc12, i ~mol/1 gtp, 0.1 retool/1
 xxxd1773xxx , 0.5 mmol/1 r o 20-1724, 0.2mmol/1 ethyleneglycol-bis-(fl-aminoethylether)-n,n'-tetraacetic

for the inhibition of neca-induced changes of adenylate cyclase and platelet aggregation k~-values were calculated from schild plots
using 3 concentrations of the antagonist as shown in figs. 1 and 2 for theophyiline. values for slope and correlation coefficients were similar
to those shown for theophylline. mean values of duplicate determinations are shown. [3h]neca (10 nmol/1) binding was 540 _ 40 fmol/
mg protein (means + sem), and the ki-values were calculated from icso-values according to cheng and prusoff (1973) using the high
affinity kd of [3h]neca (0.16 gmol/1) taken from hfittemann et al. (1984). each ki-value is the geometric mean of 3 experiments using
7 - 9 concentrations of the competitor

creatine kinase, 2 m g / m l bovine  xxxg124xxx  and
50 mmol/1 tris-hc1, ph 7.4, in a total volume of 100 ixl. in
the case of rat fat cell membranes,  xxxg62xxx 
(1 ~tg/ml) and 150 mmol/1 nacl were included in the assay
(londos et al. 1978, 1980). the concentration of [~-3zp]atp
was 0.1 mrnol/1 (0.75 ~tci/tube) for rat fat cells and
0.1 mmol/1 (0.5 [xci/tube) for human platelets. incubations
were initiated by the addition of fat cell membranes (approximately 15 ~tg protein/tube) or human platelet membranes
(approximately 2 0 - 3 0 ~tg protein/tube) to reaction mixtures that had been preincubated for 5 min at 37 ~c and were
conducted for 10 rain at 37 ~c. reactions were stopped by
the addition of 0.4 ml of 125 retool/1 zinc acetate. under
these conditions cyclic a m p formation was linear as a function of time for at least 12 min. cyclic a m p was purified by
coprecipitation of other 5'-nucleotides with zncoa and by
chromatography on neutral alumina. znco3 was formed
by the addition of 0.5 ml of 144 mmol/1 na2co3. after
centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 • g, 0.8 ml of the supernatant was applied to neutral alumina columns (approximately
1.2 g) equilibrated with 0.1 tool/1 tris-hc1, ph 7.4, and was
followed by two 2 ml portions of the same buffer. the
effluent was collected, and cyclic [3zp]amp was determined
by measuring cerenkov radiation in a liquid scintillation
counter.  xxxd1773xxx  recovery was more than 98 % as determined in recovery experiments with tritiated  xxxd1773xxx .

radioligand binding. the binding of 5'-n-ethylcarboxamido[3h]adenosine ([3h]neca) to human platelet membranes was performed as described by hiittemann et al.
(1984). the standard assay contained 50 mmol/1 tris-hc1,
ph 7.4, 10 nmol/1 [3h]neca and 6 0 - 8 0 ~tg platelet membrane protein in a final volume of 250 ~tl. the incubation

was carried out for 60 min at 0~ and was terminated by
rapid filtration of a 200 gl aliquot through a whatman gf/
b glass fiber filter (25 m m diameter). the filter was
immediately washed with two 3 ml portions of the ice-cold
incubation buffer. after addition of 4 ml triton-based
scintillation fluid (quickszint 402, zinsser analytic gmbh,
frankfurt, f r g ) radioactivity on the filters was determined
in a tracor analytic liquid scintillation counter (mark iii)
with a counting efficiency of 55%. specific binding was
defined as the amount of the radioligand bound in the absence of competing ligand minus the amount bound in the
presence of 0.3 mmol/1 neca.
the measurement of n6-r-(-)-phenylisopropyl[3h] adenosine ([3h]pia) binding to brain membranes was
carried out as described previously (lohse et al. 1984). binding of [3h]pia to membranes (100 ~tg of protein per tube)
was carried out in 50 mmol/1 tris-hc1 buffer, ph 7.4, in a
total volume of 250 gl in the presence of 0.08 u/ml of  xxxg62xxx  to remove endogenous adenosine; [3h]pia
was present in a final concentration of 1 nmol/i. other substances were added as indicated. incubation was carried out
at 37~ for 90 min for rat brain membranes and 120 rain
for bovine brain membranes and was terminated by rapid
filtration of an aliquot of 200 ~tl through a whatman gf/
b glass fiber filter. the subsequent washing and counting
procedures were as described above. nonspecific binding
was determined in the presence of 10 gmol/1 n 6 - r - ( - ) phenylisopropyladenosine (r-pia).

results

adenylate cyclase activity of human platelet membranes
5'-n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (neca) was used to
evaluate the a2 adenosine receptor antagonism by xanthine
derivatives in human platelets because this adenosine
analogue has been shown to be a potent az receptor agonist
for stimulation of adenylate cyclase and inhibition of platelet
aggregation (cusack and hourani 1981).
figure 1 shows the concentration-response curve for the
effect of neca on human platelet adenylate cyclase. neca
stimulated adenylate cyclase activity approximately 6-fold
over basal values with an ecbo of 0.33 ~tmol/1 (95% confidence limits 0.22-0.48). theophylline alone did not affect
basal enzyme activity, but produced a parallel right-shift of
the concentration-response curve without a change of slope
or maximal effect. the ecso of neca in the presence of
10 and 100 ~tmol/1 theophylline was 0.59 and 2.4 lamol/1,
respectively. the dissociation constant kb for theophylline
calculated from the schild plot of these data was 13 ~tmol/l

adenylate cyclase activity of rat fat cell membranes was determined in the presence of increasing concentration of r-pia (1 nmol/1 to
10 gmol/1, ic50 19 nm) and the kb-valuesfor the reversal of r-pia-induced inhibition by xanthine derivatives calculated from schild plots
are shown. the kb-values are the means of duplicate determinations. ki-values for the inhibition of [3h]pia binding to rat and bovine
cerebral cortex membranes were calculated from icso-values of competition curves after transformation according to cheng and prusoff
(1973). ko-values for [3h]pia used for the calculation were determined from saturation experiments and were 1.4 nmol/1 for rat brain and
0.13 nmol/1 for bovine brain. the kj-values are the means of 2 to 3 experiments done in duplicate with 6 - 1 0 different concentrations of
the competitors

(95% confidence limits 10.7-16.1) as shown in the lower
panel of fig. 1. the slope of the line is near unity confirming
a competitive antagonism between n e c a and theophylline.

platelet aggregation
we have further studied the effects of xanthine derivatives
on the neca-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation
(fig. 2). n e c a inhibited the adp-induced aggregation of
human platelets with an ic5o of 0.54 ~tmol/1 (95% confidence limits 0.41-0.70). a t concentrations between 1 and
100 gmol/1 theophylline alone had no effect on adpinduced aggregation. the concentration-response curve of
n e c a was shifted to the right by theophylline resulting in
an increase of the ics0 for n e c a to 1.2 and 4.5 ~tmol/l at
10 and 100 gmol/1 theophylline, respectively. the kb for
theophylline calculated from the schild plot of these data
was 9.5 ~tmol/1 (95% confidence limits 4.8-19.1).
both methods were used to evaluate the as receptor
antagonism of several xanthine derivatives. the kb-values of
antagonists for the inhibition of neca effects on adenylate
cyclase and platelet aggregation are listed in table 1 and
were calculated from schild plots as described for
theophylline. in addition, the k~-values for inhibition of
[3h]neca binding to human platelet membranes are
shown. xanthine itself had adenosine antagonistic properties as inhibitor of neca-stimulated adenylate cyclase and
the kb-value was 93 gmol/1. nearly all xanthine derivatives
with 7-position substituents were less potent than xanthine.
among these compounds are several drugs which are used
therapeutically as bronchodilators and vasodilators, such
as  xxxd1958xxx ,  xxxd3038xxx ,  xxxd2880xxx  and etofylline.

also  xxxd1999xxx  ( xxxd1999xxx ) was less potent than
xanthine.
all other compounds listed in table 1 were more potent
az adenosine antagonists compared to xanthine. thus,
caffeine (l,3, xxxd404xxx ) was 2 times more potent
and theophylline ( xxxd3344xxx ) and paraxanthine
(1, xxxd3343xxx ) were 7 times more potent than
xanthine, whereas theobromine ( xxxd3343xxx ) was
6 times less potent than xanthine. if the two latter dimethyl
derivatives are compared directly, there is a 45-fold difference in potency between the 1,7-dimethyl and the 3,7-dimethyl substituents. the 3-isobutyl substituent produced a
twofold increase in antagonist activity compared to
theophylline. a more pronounced increase in potency was
seen with most of the 8-phenyl substituents. 8-phenyltheophylline was 3 times more potent than theophylline. a
4-hydroxy group on the 8-phenyl ring had an additional
effect on potency so that 8-(4-hydroxyphenyl)theophylline
was 40 times more potent than theophylline. all other
changes at the 1,3-positions by diethyl or dipropyl substituents as well as additional substituents on the 8-phenyl
ring did not produce a marked additional increase in antagonist potency at a2 adenosine receptors.
somewhat different results were obtained in the study of
platelet aggregation. whereas all compounds which were
more potent than xanthine in the cyclase studies exhibited a
pharmacological profile nearly identical to that obtained in
the adenylate cyclase studies, xanthine itself and all less
potent derivatives did not antagonize the effect of neca
on platelet aggregation but potentiated the inhibitory action
of neca. as shown in table 2, these compounds alone
caused only marginal inhibition of aggregation between 2%

the ratios express the  xxxg81xxx  selectivity and were obtained by dividing the kb-values for adenylate cyclase of human platelets by the
kb-values for adenylate cyclase of rat fat cells (ratio i), ki-values of [3h]pia binding in rat brain (ratio ii) and the ki-values of [3h]pia
binding in bovine brain listed in tables 1 and 3

and 15%. however, they induced a left shift of the concentration-response curve for n e c a and thereby produced a 2to 7-fold decrease o f the ic5o-vahies for n e c a .

inhibition of [3 h] neca binding
to human platelet membranes
furthermore we have attempted to determine the a 2 receptor affinities o f xanthine derivatives by measuring the
inhibition of [3n]neca binding to human platelet membranes. as shown in table 1, most of the ki-values
for [3n]neca binding are 10 to 100 times higher than the

corresponding kb-values from adenylate cyclase and platelet
aggregation. the potent 8-phenylxanthine ~derivatives did
not at all compete with [3h]neca binding at concentrations
up to 100 pmol/1. therefore, [3h]neca binding in platelet
membranes is not a suitable model to evaluate structureactivity relationships of a2 receptor antagonists.

inhibition of adenylate cyelase of rat fat cell membranes
n6-r-(-)-phenylisopropyladenosine (r-pia) was used to

rat brain [3h] pia binding ([g k~)

fig, 5. correlation of dissociation constants of xanthine derivatives
for inhibition of [3h]pia binding to bovine brain (o
o, r =
0.993) and for the antagonism of r-pia-induced inhibition of rat
fat cell adenylate cyclase ( 0
0 , r = 0.993) with the ki-values
of [3h]pia binding in rat brain. data and numbers of the
compounds are taken from table 3
as a highly potent and selective ai receptor agonist for
inhibition of adenylate cyclase, lipolysis and radioligand
binding in fat cells (londos et al. 1978, 1980; trost and
schwabe 1981).
as shown in fig. 3, basal activity of adenylate cyclase of
rat fat cell membranes was inhibited by r-pia with an ics0
of 19nmol/1. the adenosine antagonist 8-(4-hydroxyphenyl)theophylline did not affect basal activity in the absence of r-pia, but shifted the concentration-response
curve of r-pia to the right. the slope and the maximal
effect were not changed. the icso of r-pia in the presence
of 10, 100 and 1,000 nmol/1 8-(4-hydroxyphenyl)theophylline was 24, 52 and 380 nmol/1, respectively. the kb for 8(4-hydroxyphenyl)theophylline calculated from the schild
plot of these data was 51 nmol/1.
the same procedure was used to determine the aa receptor antagonism of several other xanthine derivatives. the
kb-values of antagonists for the r-pia-induced inhibition
of adenylate cyclase are listed in table 3. xanthine itself
showed a relatively weak antagonistic effect as indicated
by a kb of ] 70 gmol/1. with the exception of caffeine and
1,7-dimethylxanthineall xanthine derivatives with substituents in the 7-position were less potent than xanthine.
theophylline and 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine ( xxxd2388xxx )
were approximately 20 times more potent than xanthine. a
marked increase in antagonist affinity was obtained with
8-phenylxanthine derivatives. 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine
(dpx) and 8-(4-acetoxyphenyl)theophylline were 3 0 - 4 0
times more potent than theophylline and the additional
4-hydroxy substituent on the 8-phenyl ring induced a further
3-fold increase of potency. the highest affinity was obtained with 1,3-dipropyl-8-(2-amino-4-chlorophenyl)xanthine
(pacpx) which gave a kb of 8.6 nmol/1 and thus was 1,000
times more potent than theophylline.

finally, the xanthine derivatives were characterized as a1
adenosine receptor antagonists in binding studies with
[3h]pia using membrane preparations of rat and bovine
cerebral cortex. for several compounds competition curves
obtained for bovine brain membranes are shown in fig. 4.
again, pacpx was the most potent compound with a ki of
0.30 nmol/1 (95% confidence limits 0.23 -0.39), followed by
8-phenyltheophylline, 8-(4-acetoxyphenyl)theophylline, 3isobutyl-l-methylxanthine and theophylline. the competition curves were monophasic with hill coefficients between
0.85 and 1.1, indicating the absence of cooperative interactions.
for these and several other xanthine derivatives ics0values were calculated from competition curves, transformed into ki-values according to cheng and prusoff
(1973) and listed in table 3. the structure-activity profile of
[3h]pia binding to rat brain is very similar to that obtained
for adenylate cyclase activity in rat fat cells. this is also
evident from the paired comparison of the dissociation
constants of both systems shown in fig. 5. the data
obtained with bovine brain membranes agree well with those
of the two other systems as far as the less potent xanthine
derivatives are concerned. however, all 8-phenylxanthines
are 10 to 20 times more potent inhibitors of [3h]pia binding
to bovine brain than to rat brain and of r-pia-mediated
inhibition in rat fat cells. in bovine brain 8-phenyltheophylline is 1,000 times more potent than theophylline and
pacpx has a ki-value of 0.3 nmol/1. despite these differences a good correlation (r = 0.993) between the ki-values
for inhibition of [3h]pia binding in bovine brain versus rat
brain is obtained (fig. 5), but the regression line is steeper
due to the higher affinity of the 8-phenylxanthine derivatives
to a~ receptors of bovine brain.

comparison of a1 and a2 adenosine receptors
the selectivity of xanthine derivatives as antagonists at the
two subclasses of adenosine receptors can be derived from
the potencies at aa and az receptors. ratios were calculated
from the directly comparable functional parameters which
are adenylate cyclase activity of human platelets and rat fat
cells (ratio i). furthermore, the kb-values ofplatelet cyclase
were related to the ki-values for inhibition of [3h]pia binding in rat brain (ratio ii) and in bovine brain (ratio iii). the
values are shown in table 4.
for ratio i most of the compounds show values between
0.4 and 6, demonstrating that these xanthine derivatives are
nearly equipotent as antagonists at aa and az adenosine
receptors. with the exception of 8-(4-acetoxyphenyl)theophylline and 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine, these compounds are relatively weak adenosine antagonists with kbvalues in the micromolar range. however, a substantial
selectivity is observed with the last four compounds among
which 8-phenyltheophylline is 26 times and pacpx is 55
times more potent at a1 receptors than at a2 receptors
(table 4). very similar ratios result from correlations with
the ks-values of rat brain (ratio ii). if the data of human
platelet cyclase are correlated with those of the aa receptor
system of bovine brain (ratio iii) all 8-phenylxanthines exhibit a high degree of at receptor selectivity. particularly

219
high ratios are obtained for 8-phenyltheophylline (700) and
pacpx (1,600).
discussion

methylxanthines and related xanthine derivatives have been
studied as adenosine antagonists for more than two decades.
after the proposal of the present adenosine receptor concept
with two receptor subtypes, it was of interest to look for
subtype-selective adenosine antagonists. the results of the
present study show that several 8-phenylxanthines are
remarkably selective for a1 adenosine receptors. 8-phenyltheophylline is approximately 700 times more potent as antagonist at at than at az adenosine receptors. the recently
developed 8-phenylxanthine derivative, pacpx, is even
1,600 times more potent as at adenosine antagonist.
these high selectivity ratios have been obtained with
bovine brain membranes versus human ptatelets and display
the optimal conditions among the three  xxxg81xxx  systems
assayed in the present study. in bovine brain 8-phenylxanthines are 10 to 20 times more potent than in rat brain or
rat fat cells. if the data of the  xxxg81xxx  systems of rat
tissues are used for the correlation, the selectivity of
8-phenyltheophylline is still 20 to 40-fold and of pacpx
50 to 70-fold. thus, our results consistently demonstrate
an at receptor selectivity in 3 different at receptor systems
as a characteristic property of several 8-phenylxanthine
derivatives.
the enhanced affinity of 8-phenylxanthine derivatives
for adenosine receptors has previously been observed for at
as well as for a2 receptor systems. the prototype of this
group of compounds, 8-phenyltheophylline, was first studied as adenosine antagonist in the a2 receptor system of
guinea pig cerebral cortex by smellie et al. (1979). in this
system, 8-phenyltheophylline (ki 6 gmol/1) was 10 times
more potent than theophylline in antagonizing the
adenosine-induced accumulation of  xxxd1773xxx . in a second
a2 receptor system, the human fibroblast, 8-phenyltheophylline (ki 0.18 gmol/1) was even more potent than in
guinea pig brain and, in addition, was 25 times more potent
than theophylline (bruns 1981). in the present study, the
potency of 8-phenyltheophylline in antagonizing a2 receptor-mediated responses of human platelets (k~ 4.1 and
3.6 lamol/1) is similar to that of guinea pig brain.
the effect of 8-phenylxanthines on at adenosine receptors was first investigated in radioligand binding studies
with several brain membrane preparations. bruns et al.
(1980) found that 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine (dpx) was
the most potent at receptor antagonist in guinea pig brain
(icso 0.5 gmol/1) followed by 8-phenyltheophylline (icso
1 gmol/1), whereas 8-(4-sulfophenyl)theophylline (icso
20 gmol/1) was even less potent than theophylline. in two
other species, 8-phenyltheophylline was considerably more
potent as at receptor antagonist than in guinea pig brain.
in rat brain synaptosomal membranes an icso of 116 nmol/1
(williams and risley 1980) and in bovine brain membranes
an ic5o of 1.2 nmol/i (bruns et al. 1983) were determined.
these values agree closely with the results obtained with 8phenyltheophylline as at receptor antagonist in rat brain (k~
115 nmol/1) and bovine brain (ki 5.9 nmol/l) in the present
study. 8-phenyltheophylline has also been studied as adenosine antagonist in guinea pig atrium, rabbit basilar artery
and guinea pig ileum, and kb-values between 70 and
760 nmol/1 were obtained (griffith et al. 1981).

the structure-activity relationship of 8-phenylxanthine
derivatives at at receptors has been extensively analyzed by
bruns et al. (1983). these authors tested the effects of 43
xanthine derivatives in the sensitive  xxxg81xxx  system of
bovine brain and developed several compounds of extraordinary receptor affinity. the most potent adenosine antagonist was 1,3-dipropyl-8-(2-amino-4-chlorophenyl)xanthine
(pacpx) with a ki-value of 0.022 nmol/1 for at receptors.
in the present study, pacpx was less potent (ki 0.3 nmol/1)
in bovine brain but still the most potent and most selective
antagonist for a1 receptors. bruns et al. (1983) did not assess
the potency of the newly developed 8-phenylxanthines at an
az receptor system and, therefore, the relative selectivity for
a1 receptors cannot directly be evaluated. however, some
of the compounds have previously been tested by the same
author as a2 receptor antagonists in human fibroblasts
(bruns 1981). if these two adenosine receptor systems are
used for a correlation, a considerable selectivity can be
calculated. 8-phenyltheophylline is 150 times more potent
at at receptors of bovine brain than at aa receptors of
human fibroblasts. a 270-fold selectivity for at receptors is
obtained for 8-(4-methylphenyl)theophylline. our data yield
an even higher selectivity for several 8-phenylxanthines at
ai receptors, mainly because of the lower sensitivity of the
a2 receptors in human platelets compared to that of human
fibroblasts.
in two comparative studies on at and a2 receptor subtypes a selectivity of 8-phenylxanthines for at adenosine
receptors has not been detected. fredholm and persson
(1982) reported that the absolute and relative potencies of
10 xanthine derivatives were almost identical in two at
receptor systems (rat cerebral cortex membranes, rat fat
cells) and an ae receptor system (rat hippocampal slices).
1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine and 8-phenyltheophylline
were the most potent compounds with ki-values of approximately 100 to 200 nmol/1. only  xxxd1999xxx  was found to
be 20 to 30 times more potent in the hippocampal system
(a2) than in the two other systems. in the present study
 xxxd1999xxx  did not show selective antagonism at a2 adenosine receptors. glennon et al. (1984) tested 6 xanthines and
22 mesionic xanthine analogues on at receptors (rat cerebral
cortical membranes) and a2 receptors (guinea pig cerebral
cortical slices). again, 8-phenyltheophylline was the most
potent antagonist. however, a substantial selectivity was not
obtained, as shown by icso-values of 800 nmol/1 for the
a~ receptor and 1,700 nmol/1 for the az receptor system,
whereas in the present study 8-phenyltheophylline (ki
115 nmol/1 ) was more potent as a~ receptor antagonist
and less potent as a2 antagonist in human platelets (ki
4,100 nmol/1 ).
antagonists with a substantial selectivity for a2 adenosine receptors were were not detected in the present study.
xanthine and 1, xxxd3343xxx  were two times more
potent as a2 than as  xxxg81xxx  antagonists, but both
compounds had only weak antagonist activity. a similar
observation was reported for several mesoionic benzothiazolopyrimidines which displayed ics0-values between 30
and 40 gmol/1 for atreceptors and 15 and 20 tmaol/1 for a2
receptors (glennon et al. 1984). the only compound, for
which a relatively high degree of selectivity for az receptors
has been reported, was 8-(4-sulfophenyl)theophylline (bruns
et al. 1980). this compound (ki 1.2 gmol/1) was more potent
as ae antagonist in human fibroblasts than theophylline and
showed an 80-fold selectivity for a2 receptors. however, this

220
observation was not confirmed by f r e d h o l m a n d persson
(1982).
m a n y xanthine derivatives analyzed in the present p a p e r
have been previously examined as inhibitors o f cyclic a m p
phosphodiesterases. in general, xanthine derivatives are
m o r e p o t e n t as adenosine receptor antagonists than as
phosphodiesterase inhibitors. theophylline, for instance,
has a ki o f 10 to 13 ~tmol/1 as a2 receptor antagonist in
h u m a n platelets in the present study whereas the ki for the
inhibition o f platelet phosphodiesterase was f o u n d to be
45 gmol/1 (asano et al. 1977). a t a1 receptors o f rat fat cells
we obtained a k~ o f 9.5 ~tmol/1 for theophylline c o m p a r e d
to a ki o f 91 ~nol/1 for inhibition o f phosphodiesterase in
the same tissue (schwabe et al. 1972). in rat brain
theophylline is a very weak phosphodiesterase inhibitor
(icso 5 0 0 - 1 , 0 0 0 gmol/1) a n d is already considered as a
quite selective adenosine antagonist (smellie et al. 1979).
3 - i s o b u t y l - l - m e t h y l x a n t h i n e ( xxxd2388xxx ) is usually regarded as
a specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor with a relatively low
ki o f 7.5 ~tmol/1 (smellie et al. 1979), but our present d a t a
show that a1 and a2 adenosine receptors (ki 2.5 to
7.6 ~tmol/1) are antagonized in the same concentration range
and a mixture o f b o t h effects must always be expected. 8phenyltheophylline and other 8-phenylxanthines are relatively weak phosphodiesterase inhibitors with icso-values
ranging from 30 to m o r e than 100 gmol/1 (smellie et al.
1979; w u et al. 1982). obviously, the 8-phenyl substituent
does not substantially increase the potency as p h o s p h o d i esterase inhibitor but m a r k e d l y enhances the affinity for a1
and a2 adenosine receptors. therefore, 8-phenylxanthines
can be used as selective adenosine receptor antagonists
without substantial interference by inhibitory effects on
phosphodiesterase. w i t h their additional selectivity for the
a1 adenosine receptor subtype, several 8-phenylxanthines,
such as 8-phenyltheophylline a n d p a c p x , offer a first
a p p r o a c h to study the p h a r m a c o l o g i c a l effects o f a subtypeselective b l o c k a d e o f adenosine receptors.
