abstract
exenatide, the active ingredient of byetta® (exenatide injection), is an incretin mimetic that has been developed for the treatment of patients
with type 2 diabetes. exenatide binds to and activates the known  xxxg899xxx  with a potency comparable to that of the mammalian incretin
glp-1(7-36), thereby acting as a glucoregulatory agent. ac3174 is an analog of exenatide with leucine substituted for methionine at position 14,
[leu14] xxxd2076xxx . the purpose of these studies was to evaluate the glucoregulatory activity and pharmacokinetics of ac3174. in rinm5f cell
membranes, the potency of ac3174 for the displacement of [125i]glp-1 and activation of adenylate cyclase was similar to that of exenatide and
glp-1. in vivo, ac3174, administered as a single ip injection, significantly decreased plasma glucose concentration and glucose excursion
following the administration of an oral glucose challenge in both non-diabetic (c57bl/6) and diabetic db/db mice (p b 0.05 vs. vehicle-treated).
the magnitude of glucose lowering of ac3174 was comparable to exenatide. the ed50 values of ac3174 for glucose lowering (60 minute postdose) were 1.2 mug/kg in db/db mice and 1.3 mug/kg in c57bl/6 mice. ac3174 has insulinotropic activity in vivo. administration of ac3174
resulted in a 4-fold increase in insulin concentrations in normal mice following an ip glucose challenge. ac3174 was also shown to inhibit food
intake and decrease gastric emptying in rodent models. ac3174 was stable in human plasma (n 90% of parent peptide was present after 5 h of
incubation). in rats, the in vivo half-life of ac3174 was 42–43 min following sc administration. in summary, ac3174 is an analog of exenatide
that binds to the  xxxg899xxx  in vitro and shares many of the biological and glucoregulatory activities of exenatide and glp-1 in vivo.

1. introduction
exenatide, the active ingredient of byetta® (exenatide
injection), is an incretin mimetic that has been developed for the
treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. exenatide is a 39-amino
acid peptide amide originally isolated from the salivary secretions
of heloderma suspectum (gila monster) [1]. in vitro, exenatide
binds to and activates the known  xxxg873xxx -(7-36)amide (glp-1) receptor [2,3]. exenatide shares many of the
glucoregulatory actions observed with glp-1 [4–9]. clinical and
nonclinical studies have shown that exenatide has several
beneficial antidiabetic (glucose-lowering) actions that include

glucose-dependent enhancement of insulin secretion, glucose
dependent suppression of inappropriately high glucagon secretion, slowing of gastric emptying, reduction of food intake and
body weight, and an increase in beta-cell mass (animal studies) and
markers of beta-cell function [4,5,7,10–21]. relative to the
endogenous mammalian incretin hormone, glp-1, exenatide is
resistant to cleavage by dipeptidylpeptidase iv ( xxxg651xxx ) resulting
in a longer half-life and duration of action and greater potency in
rats [19].
ac3174 ([leu14] xxxd2076xxx ) is an analog of exenatide with a
single amino acid substitution, leucine for methionine at position
14 (fig. 1). because methionine can be oxidized, the rationale for
preparing ac3174 was to eliminate the potential for oxidation at
this amino acid and potentially improve shelf-life stability. the
purpose of the present study was to characterize the biological
activity of ac3174 in vitro and in vivo. for comparison purposes
exenatide was included in some of the studies.

2. materials and methods
2.1. in vitro studies
2.1.1. rinm5f cell membrane preparation
the rin cell line was derived from a rat insulinoma and is
known to express glp-1 receptors [22]. rinm5f cells
(atcc® number crl-11605™) were grown as previously
described [22]. to prepare membranes, confluent cells were
detached by edta, centrifuged, resuspended in cold 20 mm
hepes buffer and homogenized 2 × 15 seconds (s) with a
polytron homogenizer. homogenates were centrifuged and
the pellet was suspended in hepes buffer, homogenized for
5 s, aliquoted, frozen and stored at − 70 °c until used in the
assays.
2.1.2. adenylate cyclase activity
rinm5f cell membranes (50 mug protein/well) and
peptides (final concentration range 10− 12 –10 − 6 m) were
combined with assay buffer (10 mum gtp, 0.75 mm atp,
2.5 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm phosphocreatine, 12.5 u/ml
creatine kinase, 0.4 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mum  xxxd2388xxx  in
50 mm hepes, ph 7.4; final volume 100 mul) and incubated
20 min at 37 °c. supernatant camp was determined by spa
immunoassay or by camp alphascreen technology (perkin
elmer).
2.1.3. binding displacement of [125 i]glp-1 in rinm5f cells
cell membranes, radioligand ([125i]glp-1, 60 pm) and
peptides (final concentration range 10− 12 –10− 6 m) were
combined with buffer (5 mg/ml  xxxd3463xxx , 1 mg/ml  xxxd2936xxx , 1 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , 1 mg/ml bacitracin
and 1 mm mgcl2 in 20 mm hepes [ph 7.4]; 200 mul volume)
and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. well contents
were harvested onto glass fiber pads using a plate harvester.
dried pads combined with scintillant were counted in a plate
scintillation counter.
2.1.4. plasma stability
peptides (final concentration 0.01 mg/ml) were added to
human plasma and incubated at 37 °c for 5 h. aliquots were
extracted as follows: 100 mul of peptide/plasma solution and
10 mul of an internal standard peptide (0.05 mg/ml) were added
to 100 mul 0.2%  xxxd2154xxx :acetonitrile in the wells of a protein
precipitation plate (whatman); plates were capped, shaken
vigorously for 2 min and vacuum filtered; 135 mul of water was
added to the filtrate. the peptide content of extracted plasma
was determined by lc/ms and normalized to the internal
standard.

2.2. in vivo studies
2.2.1. animals
all procedures were conducted according to the guidelines
of the institutional animal care and use committee at amylin
inc. mice and rats used in these studies were male c57bl/6 and
c57bl/ksolahsd- xxxg1320xxx  (db/db) mice (jackson laboratories
bar harbor, me; or harlan indianapolis, in; 5–14 weeks old);
nih swiss mice (harlan, indianapolis, in; 8–24 weeks old) or
sprague dawley® rats (harlan, indianapolis, in) (7–9 week old).
animals were housed 2–3 per cage at 22 °c with a 12 hour
light/dark cycle and were acclimated for at least 6d before use.
food [chow from harlan teklad lm-485 diet (7012)] and
water were provided ad libitum.
2.2.2. pharmacokinetics of ac3174 in rats
pharmacokinetics were conducted in anesthetized rats as
previously described [19] with the modification that isoflurane
was used for anesthesia and ac3174 (10 and 100 mug/kg in
saline) was administered by subcutaneous (sc) injection.
plasma concentrations of ac3174 were determined using an
immunoenzymetric assay (iema) that had been validated for
determination of exenatide and was suitable for determination
of plasma ac3174 concentrations.
2.2.3. glucoregulatory activity in c57bl/6 and db/db mice
ac3174 was evaluated for its effects to acutely lower
plasma glucose, improve oral glucose tolerance and stimulate
insulin secretion in c57bl/6 lean and db/db mice. in some
of the studies a maximally effective dose of exenatide was
included for comparison. peptide dosing solutions were
prepared on the day of the experiment in a vehicle containing
10% dmso and administered as a single intraperitoneal (ip)
injection (dosing volume 4 ml/kg). mice had food removed
from their cages 3 h before the experiment. in a dose
response study, ac3174 was administered at doses ranging
from 0.02–40 mug/kg. in all other studies ac3174 or
exenatide was administered at a dose of 20 mug/kg. blood
samples collected by retroorbital bleeding into heparinized
capillary tubes were taken prior to peptide administration and
for up to 6 h after dosing. in studies involving oral or ip
glucose tolerance tests (ogtt or ipgtt) glucose (50%
dextrose solution) was administered by oral gavage (2 g
glucose/kg body weight) or ip injection (1.5 g glucose/kg
body weight) 5 min or 60 min after peptide administration,
respectively.

3. results
3.1. in vitro binding and functional activity
in vitro data for binding and functional activity (cyclase
activation) of ac3174, exenatide and glp-1 in rin cell
membranes are summarized in table 1 and fig. 2. ac3174 and
exenatide have sub-nanomolar potencies for displacement of
125
i-glp-1 and activation of adenylate cyclase. relative to
glp-1, ac3174 and exenatide had equal potency and 100%
efficacy in the cyclase functional assay but were 3.5- to 4.4-fold
less potent in the binding assay.

3.2. plasma stability and pharmacokinetics
ac3174 and exenatide were stable in human plasma. after
5 h of incubation at 37 °c, n 90% of parent peptide remained
intact. in contrast, for glp-1 there was 46% parent peptide
remaining at 1 h of incubation and 12% remaining at 5 h. (data
not shown).
time course of plasma concentrations of ac3174 from the in
vivo rat pk study is shown in fig. 3. pharmacokinetic parameters
are summarized in table 2. ac3174 exhibited dose proportional
increases in cmax and auc and had a half-life of 42–43 min.
3.3. acute glucoregulatory activity in c57bl/6 and db/db mice
ac3174 administered as a single ip injection at doses ranging
from 0.02 to 40 mug/kg to c57bl/6 and db/db mice produced dose-related decreases in plasma glucose concentration

(measured at 60 minute post-dose) (fig. 4). the ed50 values of
ac3174 for glucose lowering were 1.2 mug/kg in db/db mice and
1.3 mug/kg in c57bl/6 mice.
in subsequent studies, ac3174 and exenatide were directly
compared at the maximally effective dose of 20 mug/kg. the dose
of 20 mug/kg was selected on the basis of maximal effectiveness
for 60 minute glucose lowering (see fig. 4 for ac3174 and
reference [21] for exenatide).
in studies to examine the duration of glucose lowering,
peptides were administered as a single ip injection (20 mug/kg
ac3174 or exenatide; 800 mug/kg glp-1) and glucose was
measured through 6 h post-dose. in c57bl/6 and db/db mice,
exenatide significantly decreased glucose through the duration
of measurement (6 h) (p b 0.05 vs. vehicle treatment) and
ac3174 significantly decreased glucose through 4 h postdose (p b 0.05 vs. vehicle treatment). glp-1 given at a 40-fold
higher dose decreased glucose for 1–2 h (data not shown).
one of the important glucoregulatory actions of exenatide
is the improvement of postprandial glycemia. to study this in
the mouse models, exenatide or ac3174 was administered 1 h
before an ogtt. ac3174 and exenatide significantly
decreased plasma glucose concentration to a similar extent
before and after the ogtt in both db/db and c57bl/6 mice
(fig. 5a and b). at t = 0 min (60 minute post-dose), plasma
glucose concentrations (mean ± sem, n = 4–11) were 179 ± 9,
106 ± 10 and 121 ± 6 mg/dl in c57bl/6 mice and 600 ± 36,

275 ± 30 and 285 ± 24 mg/dl in db/db mice treated with
vehicle, ac3174 (20 mug/kg) or exenatide (20 mug/kg),
respectively. in c57bl/6 mice, glucose auc0–120 following
the ogtt was significantly decreased by 75% in response to
ac3174 treatment and 57% with exenatide treatment
(p b 0.05 vs. vehicle, fig. 5c). interestingly, although db/db
mice treated with ac3174 or exenatide had a sustained
decrease in plasma glucose relative to vehicle-treated db/db
mice, ac3174 and exenatide had no effect on glucose auc0–120
(fig. 5d). it should be noted that the glucose auc was calculated
using the glucose concentration at t = 0 min as the baseline; thus
differences in glucose concentration at the start of the ogtt were
taken into account in the calculation of auc0–120.
to examine whether ac3174 has insulinotropic activity
in vivo, its ability to increase insulin concentration was
studied in c57bl/6 mice using an ip glucose challenge
(ipgtt) with blood samples for insulin and glucose
determination taken at frequent, early time points. relative
to vehicle treatment, the administration of ac3174 significantly increased plasma insulin concentration beginning at
the first time point (2 min) post-ip glucose (fig. 6) and
through the duration of measurement (30 min). the maximal
increase in insulin in mice treated with ac3174 was 4-fold
over vehicle treated mice. glucose concentration was
decreased in the ac3174 treated mice at all time points
post-dose (fig. 6).
3.4. effect of ac3174 on gastric emptying and food intake
in addition to its in vivo effects on glycemic control in mice,
ac3174 tested as a single ip or sc injection inhibited food
intake in mice and gastric emptying in rats. in these assays
ac3174 was 4- to 10-fold less potent than exenatide. the ed50
values for ac3174 and exenatide respectively were 8 and
0.8 mug/kg for inhibition of food intake in mice refeeding after an
overnight fast and 0.8 and 0.2 mug/kg for inhibition of gastric

ranging from 0.02–40 mug/kg. blood samples for glucose determination were taken prior to dosing and at 60 minute post-dose. the mean glucose values at 60 minute
post-dose are shown in the graphs. dose response data were fitted to a sigmoidal equation to determine ed50. values are mean ± sem, n = 6–8 per group.

emptying in rats. the maximal effect of exenatide and ac3174
on food intake was 61–71% inhibition.
4. discussion
ac3174 is a peptide analog of exenatide with a single amino
acid substitution that was introduced to eliminate the potential
for oxidation of methionine at position 14 of exenatide to
improve shelf-life. the purpose of these studies was to examine
the biological activity of ac3174 compared to that of exenatide.
exenatide's long duration of action in vivo via its resistance
to cleavage by  xxxg651xxx  greatly facilitated its development as a
novel agent in a new therapeutic class, incretin mimetics, for the
treatment of diabetes. in the present study, we demonstrated that
ac3174 is stable in human plasma for at least 5 h. because
 xxxg651xxx  is one of the primary endopeptidases in plasma, these
results suggest that ac3174 is also resistant to cleavage by
 xxxg651xxx . ac3174 also has a relatively long half-life in vivo as
shown in the rat pk study. the t1/2 of ac3174 was 42–43 min

117

following sc administration in rats. under identical experimental conditions and similar doses, glp-1 is reported to have
a short t1/2 of ∼5 min, whereas exenatide has a somewhat
longer t1/2 of 90–216 min [19]. differences in half-life of
exenatide and ac3174 are most likely due to increased
clearance of ac3174, as auc of ac3174 was lower than
that of exenatide (accounting for dose differences between the
studies).
in the rin cell membrane assays ac3174 and exenatide had
similar potencies for binding displacement of [125i]glp-1 and
functional activation of adenylate cyclase. rinm5f cells retain
many of the differentiated functions of pancreatic beta cells
including insulin secretion associated with activation of
adenylate cyclase and expression of the  xxxg899xxx  [22].
hence, the data are consistent with ac3174 binding to and
activating the known  xxxg899xxx .
in vivo ac3174 displayed glucoregulatory effects including
enhancement of glucose dependent insulin secretion, acute
glucose reduction and improved glucose tolerance. in the

fasted for 3 h. ac3174 (20 mug/kg), exenatide (20 mug/kg) or vehicle were dosed (ip) at −60 min to lean mice (graphs a and c) and db/db mice (graphs b and d). glucose (2 g/kg)
was administered by oral gavage at t=0 min. time course of plasma glucose concentration is shown in the top graphs (a and b) and glucose auc0–120 is shown in the lower
graphs (c and d). values are mean±sem, n=4–11. ⁎p b 0.05 vs. corresponding vehicle group.

118

in the ogtt study. ac3174 had similar potency and duration of
action in reducing glucose in c57bl/6 and db/db mice. hence, the
glucose auc results may reflect the severe phenotype and beta cell
exhaustion of db/db mice [24–26]. the peptides given 1 h before
the glucose challenge may have stimulated insulin release
contributing to the initial glucose lowering. when the db/db
mice were given the oral glucose challenge at 60 minute postpeptide treatment their pancreatic reserve may have been
insufficient to mount an insulin secretory response.
in addition to insulinotropic activity, slowing of gastric
emptying, glucagon suppression and decreased food intake are
believed to contribute to the glucoregulatory and weight loss
effects of exenatide in the clinic. in the present report, ac3174
inhibited food intake and gastric emptying in rodent models.
the magnitude of effect of ac3174 was similar to exenatide but
exenatide was 4- to 10-fold more potent than ac3174. the
lower potency of ac3174 may be the result of its shorter halflife in vivo.
in summary, the results of the present studies suggest that
ac3174 shares many biological activities with exenatide and
glp-1 in vitro and following acute administration in vivo. the
substitution of leucine for methionine on exenatide may confer
advantages for ex vivo chemical stability. the present results
demonstrate that the substituted peptide retains biological
activity in vitro and in vivo and a longer biological half-life
than the endogenous incretin glp-1.
fig. 6. effect of ac3174 on glucose and insulin concentrations following an
ipgtt in lean mice. mice were fasted for 3 h. immediately after taking a
baseline blood sample, ac3174 (20 mug/kg) or vehicle were dosed (ip). five
minutes after administration of peptide or vehicle glucose (1.5 g/kg) was
injected ip. time course of plasma glucose concentration is shown in the top
graph and time course of insulin concentration is shown in the lower graph.
values are mean ± sem, n = 9–10. ⁎p b 0.05 vs. corresponding vehicle group.

present studies, we examined ac3174 for its acute effects on
glycemic control in mouse models. for acute glucose lowering
studies with exenatide, use of mice provides an advantage over
use of rats because rats exhibit a species-specific paradoxical
increase in glucose following acute but not chronic administration of exenatide [23]. the ed50 of ac3174 for acute glucose
lowering in lean c57bl/6 and db/db mice was similar (ed50
1.2–1.3 mug/kg) suggesting that diabetic phenotype does not
impact the potency of the peptide. in a direct side-by-side
comparison, at maximally effective doses (20 mug/kg) the
magnitude of effect of ac3174 was comparable to exenatide
for glucose lowering. the duration of action of ac3174 was
somewhat shorter than exenatide (4 h vs. ≥ 6 h) consistent with
its shorter in vivo half-life. we used an ipgtt to examine the
insulinotropic activity of ac3174 in mice. in the ipgtt study,
c57bl/6 mice dosed with ac3174 had a 4-fold increase in
insulin relative to vehicle-treated mice. the increased insulin in
mice treated with ac3174 abated as glucose levels fell. these
results are consistent with ac3174 acting as an incretin mimetic
to enhance glucose-stimulated insulin release.
one interesting result was the inability of db/db mice to achieve
a decreased glucose auc under the experimental conditions used
