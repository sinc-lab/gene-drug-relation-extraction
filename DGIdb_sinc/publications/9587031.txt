remethylation defects:
guidelines for clinical diagnosis and treatment

abstract the main remethylation defects include disorders which all have defective methionine synthesis in common.  xxxg1475xxx  deficiency impairs
methyltetrahydrofolate synthesis, defects in cytosolic reduction of  xxxd2300xxx 
(cblc/d) impair the synthesis of both methyl- and adenosyl cobalamin and deficiencies of
 xxxg1479xxx  ( xxxg1480xxx /g) are associated with defective methyl cobalamin synthesis.
the clinical presentation is characterized by acute neurological distress in early infancy. in
childhood, patients present with progressive encephalopathy with an end-stage which has
many signs in common with the adult onset form. in fact, both have more or less severe
signs of subacute degeneration of the cord. cobalamin defective patients must be treated
with parenteral supplementation of  xxxd2300xxx  (1–2 mg per dose). some methylenetetrahydrofolate patients could be folate responsive and must have a high-dosage folate
trial. in addition, oral betaine supplementation (2–9 g per day depending on age) appears an
effective means to prevent further neurological deterioration.

introduction
remethylation defects include three main disorders which
all have defective methionine synthesis in common: 5,10methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ) deficiency
which impairs 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (ch3-thf) synthesis, defects in cytosolic reduction of  xxxd2300xxx , also called cblc and d, that impair the synthesis of

both methyl- (ch3-cbl) and adenosylcobalamin (adocbl) and functional deficiencies of  xxxg1479xxx ,
also called  xxxg1480xxx  or g which are due to defective ch3-cbl
synthesis. in addition, a fourth group has appeared in only
two patients where the defect prevents the release of  xxxd2300xxx  from lysosomes (cblf) [1, 2]. in order to
delineate guidelines for diagnosis, it is of interest to discuss the clinical symptoms during three main stages of
life: (1) the neonatal period or early infancy; (2) late infancy or early childhood, and (3) adolescence or adulthood.
this report is based on a retrospective analysis of 141
patients including 99 patients gathered from the literature.
the 42 others are patients diagnosed throughout france,
of whom only some have already been published [3–11].
according to table 1, an almost equal number of patients
have their clinical onset in the neonatal period, in late infancy or early childhood and in late childhood or adulthood. both in the literature and in france, the distribution
of the different defects is quite similar in each age group.

are due to insufficient data

all three disorders are biochemically characterized by
hypomethioninaemia and homocystine accumulation secondary to  xxxg1479xxx  deficiency. in addition,
cblc/d patients have high urinary methylmalonic acid
excretion due to defective ado-cbl synthesis and secondary  xxxg1485xxx  deficiency. considering vitamin levels in plasma and red blood cells, total
serum vitamin b12 is normal or eventually increased.
however, red blood cell ch3-cbl level is low when it has
been measured in patients affected with cblc and  xxxg1480xxx /g.
in contrast,  xxxg1475xxx  deficiency is characterized by low
levels of folate in red blood cells, serum and csf. in addition, ch3-thf levels in serum and csf are undetectable, when they have been measured (normal value
> 60% of total folate).

early onset forms
the clinical symptoms of newborns and young infants
less than 3 months of age are summarized in table 2. on
the whole, they usually show signs of neurological distress of types ii or iv of the standard classification described by saudubray [12]. born after an uneventful pregnancy and birth, they display a rapidly progressive deterioration preceded by feeding difficulties, hypotonia and
lethargy. after a few days, with or without precipitating
factors such as infectious diseases or seizures, their neurological status worsens. they may go into coma, have
hypotonia or hypertonia or both and develop abnormal
movements or seizures. patients with cblc or  xxxg1480xxx /g
show signs of severe pancytopenia or at least non regenerative anaemia. this anaemia is inconstantly associated
with macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils, but is
clearly megaloblastic on bone marrow examination.
those are the general aspects of the disorders. however,
special characteristics may develop in these young infants.
cblc patients may develop multisystem deterioration.
renal failure with haemolysis, haematuria and proteinuria
were frequently seen. this haemolytic-uraemic syndrome
(hus) was clinically evident in five patients from the literature [9, 13–15] and was observed in seven of our patients [8–11]. histologically, it is characterized by a
thrombotic micro-angiopathy. in addition, if we look at all
the biological and histological data available, we can admit that four more patients had renal involvement in the

cblc group [16–19, one personal case]. cardiomyopathy
and interstitial pneumonia were present in most but not all
patients with hus [9, 13, 14, 18, 19]. they were both observed in one of our patients free of renal involvement. in
autopsied cases, the widespread micro-angiopathy which
has been described in the brain, kidneys, heart and lungs
might be responsible for these clinical signs [9, 17, 19].
this suggests that each organ could be involved independently.
progressive retinopathy with visual inattention, nystagmus or wandering ocular movements was reported in
nine cblc patients and was observed in seven of our
cblc cases. in most cases, the earliest aspect is a granular depigmentation of the macular area further associated with progressive peripheral pigmentary retinopathy. electrophysiological studies have revealed both
cone and rod involvement. retinopathy can be revealed
by electroretinogram well before clinical signs are apparent [8, 11, 18–24]. in  xxxg1480xxx /g patients, this aspects is
far from being extensively studied. however, nystagmus has been reported in five patients [25]. in all three
disorders, visual problems with altered visual evoked
potentials could be secondary to cortical blindness [6,
25–27].
communicating hydrocephalus was a further complication in four patients affected with cblc [11, 14, 28] and
in three patients affected with  xxxg1475xxx  deficiency [29, 30,
personal case]. in this latter group, one patient had superior sagittal thrombosis [29]. there was no apparent explanation in all other cases.

clinical presentation in late infancy
and early childhood
between the age of 3 months and 10 years, these disorders are mostly characterized by a progressive encephalopathy (table 3). patients affected with  xxxg1475xxx  deficiency usually show the signs of a progressive neurological deterioration [27, 30–38]. a 4- to 18-month period of normal development is followed by a period of 1
to several years of developmental slowing or arrest with
poor head growth and acquired microcephaly [33–35, 37,
38]. in the absence of effective treatment, a third period is
characterized by a rapidly progressive deterioration leading to death or severe impairment [7, 30, 32–35, 37, 38,
two personal cases]. a few young patients miss out the
second period and deteriorate abruptly following an acute
event such as generalized tonic seizures or infantile
spasms [27, 34, 36].
despite the small number of patients, the signs of the
infantile form of cblc seem to be very similar [22,
39–41], while a less specific neurological course is described in the rare  xxxg1480xxx /g patients [42, 43]. however,
both cblc and  xxxg1480xxx /g patients have megaloblastic
anaemia which brings them to medical attention and
leads to the diagnosis. in addition, it is noteworthy that
hus can occur in infancy and is not restricted to the
cblc newborns. one cblc patient, for whom we have no

further information showed this renal involvement at 9
months of age [15] as did one  xxxg1479xxx  patient at 19 months
of age [personal case]. despite treatment with vitamin
b12, the latter patient has developed refractory hypoxaemia with pulmonary hypertension at 6 years of age, a
sign which recalls the lung involvement sometimes described in the neonatal period.
considering the neurological involvement in more detail, the neurological signs are nonspecific during the period of developmental slowing. this characteristic is obviously responsible for late diagnosis. episodic seizures
of various types do not appear a major problem [29,
30–36, six personal cases]. eegs are mostly consistent
with the type of convulsions. hypotonia [29, 34, 37], hypertonia with pyramidal tract involvement [33, 35, 38]
ataxic gait [32, six personal cases] and extrapyramidal
movements [34, 38] are encountered in a few patients.
in contrast, the period of progression is somewhat characteristic. unexplained periods of profound apathy,
lethargy or coma may initiate or may punctuate a rapidly
progressive course. it is often accompanied by central
respiratory failure which can be responsible for death.
preceding or following these bouts of lethargy the neurological signs worsen with acute mental deterioration, gait
disturbances, muscular weakness, spastic paresis and
sometimes extrapyramidal symptoms with parkinsonian
rigidity and tremors [7, 30, 32–35, 37, 38, two personal
cases]. the results of neurophysiological investigations
are variable. however, ct of the brain (or earlier, pneumoencephalography) reveal a non specific cortical and
subcortical atrophy [27, 32–34 and most of our personal
cases]. in contrast, brain mri is characterized by
periventricular demyelination that predominates around
the frontal and occipital horns [38]. the rare available results of visual and auditory evoked potentials, emg and
motor nerve conduction velocity are all in accordance
with a diffuse process of demyelination. in a few patients, this has been confirmed at autopsy which has
demonstrated signs of subacute degeneration of the cord
similar to those described in vitamin b12 deficiency [38,
44].

clinical presentation in late childhood
and early adulthood
of the patients older than 10 years of age (table 4), three
among the seven cblc/d patients [45–48] are asymptomatic sibs of index cases [45, 47, 48]. nineteen patients
are affected with  xxxg1475xxx  deficiency [4, 5, 29, 49–57 and
two personal cases]. among them, 1 is an asymptomatic
adult [54] and 4 had isolated arterial thrombosis at onset
[5, 55].  xxxg1480xxx /g is reported in only 2 patients [58, one
personal case]. neurological involvement with haematological signs restricted to a mild macrocytosis is predominant in all the three diseases.
the neurological disorder results in many signs similar
to the late stage observed in childhood. previously, most
of these patients had either a normal or a mild developmental delay and a striking feature is the rapid mental deterioration occuring in the second decade of life. the psychiatric disturbances classically described were present in
only a few patients [4, 50, 56]. the mental deterioration is
accompanied by bouts of unexplained lethargy and a progressive cerebral, myelopathic and neuropathic disorder
with variable results on neurophysiological investigations.
we can conclude that in early infancy the clinical presentation is characterized by an acute neurological disturbance. in early childhood, it is a progressive encephalopathy with a late stage similar to the adult form and that both
have more or less severe signs of subacute degeneration
of the cord.

therapeutic approaches
two therapeutic approaches can be considered: – specific
vitamin supplementations and – additional therapies.

vitamin supplementations
cobalamin therapy in cblc/d and  xxxg1480xxx /g: all patients
have received some form of parenteral cobalamin supplementation and some have been exclusively treated with
vitamin b12 for various periods of time. from these data,
it can be concluded that large amounts of cobalamin (>1
mg/day) have always resulted in some biological effects
within a week. it decreases homocystine and methylmalonic accumulation and increases plasma methionine
levels. in early treated patients, therapy has improved the
clinical status. megaloblastic changes and all the visceral
complications have resolved definitively within 1–3
weeks [13, 15, 22, 24, 26, 42, 43, 46, 49, 58–60]. the
long-term follow up is poorly described. some early
treated neonates or infants have made developmental
progress but only a few have achieved a dq above 80 [21,
22, 24, 61, 62, three personal cases]. in late onset forms,
neurological sequelae are the rule [40, 47, 49, 58].
the best treatment regimen appears to be intramuscular injection of 1–2 mg/week or every other week of hy-

droxycobalamin [21]. the use of cyanocobalamin is less
effective [21, 22, 58, 62] while the theoretical benefit of
methylcobalamin is not clear [59, 60]. daily oral supplementation is insufficient to sustain biological improvement [21, 49]. among the  xxxg1475xxx  deficient patients who
have been exclusively treated with either folinic or folic
acid for various period of time, two groups are clearly delineated. the first comprises infants and children who are
biologically and clinically unresponsive [3, 33, 34, 37, 63,
64]. the second comprises adults who are biologically responsive with some immediate clinical improvement,
while sustained improvement is difficult to assess owing
to the severity of their neurological disease [4, 51, 53, 56,
65, 66].
additional therapies
in order to decrease homocysteine and to increase methionine, large amounts of betaine supplementation can be
used.
in cblc and  xxxg1480xxx /g patients, despite the effectiveness
of parenteral b12 therapy, most patients have residual homocysteine accumulation and some hypomethioninaemia.
betaine supplementation allows some biological improvement, but long-term effectiveness remains unknown [11,
21, 22, 58, 59, 67].
in  xxxg1475xxx  deficient patients, betaine has clearly improved the overall prognosis. free homocysteine levels
can be maintained below 1 or 2 µmol/l and methionine
around 15–25 µmol/l. in infants, mortality rate has decreased and quite good development can be achieved [62,
63, 68–70]. in children and adults, betaine supplementation prevents further neurological deterioration [30, 34,
51, 52, 54]. however, since betaine catabolism is folatedependent, folate supplementation should be considered
with long-term betaine therapy unless increased n,n-dimethylglycine impairs the catabolism of betaine [71].
supplementation with methionine is an effective
means to counteract hypomethioninaemia and has been
tried in a few mtthfr deficient patients [6, 34, 38, 63,
72] and in a  xxxg1479xxx  patient [2]. it clearly increases plasma
methionine levels but we have no clear evidence of better
improvement than with betaine supplementation and it
may result in sustained hyperhomocystinaemia [34, 38].
plasma carnitine levels are rarely reported, but low levels
have been mentioned in both cblc [21] and  xxxg1475xxx  patients [64, 72]. in addition, these conditions of defective
methionine synthesis may alter carnitine synthesis and
carnitine supplementation could be useful. supplementation with pyridoxine is used to enhance the homocysteine
transulphuration pathway which is mainly controlled by
the s- xxxd3156xxx  level. thus, the pyridoxine effect could be more theoretical than effective unless sufficient amounts of s- xxxd3156xxx  can be obtained
through other therapies.
there is no rationale for a low-protein diet if we consider that low methionine synthesis is the main pathogenic
factor in these disorders. in cblc/d patients, cobalamin

s81

supplementation reduces methylmalonic acid excretion to
levels which are non toxic.
in conclusion, cbl patients must be treated with daily
intravenous  xxxd2300xxx  for the first few days and
then can be switched to weekly intramuscular injections
with 1–2 mg/dose. addition of betaine (3–6 g/day), folic
acid (5 mg/day) and carnitine (50–100 mg/kg/day) must
be considered.  xxxg1475xxx  deficient patients must have a folate trial. in case of non-responsiveness the main therapeutic measure is oral betaine supplementation with 2–3
g/day in young infants to 6–9 g/day in children and adults
with addition of  xxxd2146xxx  and carnitine.
responsiveness to the treatment is usually evaluated
by measuring plasma and urine metabolites which reflect
the peripheral effects. in contrast, central effects have
been poorly investigated. rare investigations have shown
that  xxxg1475xxx  deficient patients have low levels of homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid and
biopterins in csf especially during episodes of acute neurological deterioration. in parallel, methionine, s- xxxd3156xxx  and ch3-thf in csf are profoundly decreased [27, 30, 38, 54, 66, 69]. thus, should not therapeutic effectiveness be systematically evaluated using
these central substrates?
