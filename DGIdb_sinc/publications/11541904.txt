bone markers during a 6-month space flight: effects of  xxxd3522xxx  supplementation.  rapid bone loss is a serious health problem for astronauts during long lasting missions in space. we have recorded the changes of biochemical markers for bone metabolism in one of the astronauts during the 6-month space flight of the euromir-95 mission. immediately after launch both bone resorption markers and urinary calcium excretion increased about two fold, whereas bone formation markers remained unchanged. after 12 1/2 weeks the astronaut received  xxxd2941xxx  (10 mg/day for 6 weeks).  xxxd3522xxx  is known to be involved in the formation of gamma-carboxyglutamate (gla) in proteins, such as the calcium-binding bone gla-proteins osteocalcin and matrix gla-protein. concomitant with the start of  xxxd3522xxx  treatment, the calcium-binding capacity of osteocalcin increased, and so did the urinary excretion of free gla. this is suggestive for a subclinical  xxxd3522xxx -deficiency in the astronaut before  xxxd3522xxx -supplementation. during periods of high  xxxd3522xxx  status markers for bone formation (osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase) had increased as compared to the first part of the flight. the mean increases were 14 and 23%, respectively. our data suggest that increased intake of  xxxd3522xxx  may contribute to counteracting microgravity-induced loss of bone mass during long lasting space missions, but need confirmation in more astronauts.
