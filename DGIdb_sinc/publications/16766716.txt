abstract
varenicline, a new nicotinic ligand based on the structure of
 xxxd1792xxx , has recently been approved by the u.s. food and
drug administration for use as a smoking cessation aid. varenicline has been shown to be a partial agonist of ␣4␤2 receptors,
and in equilibrium binding assays, it is highly selective for the
␣4␤2 receptor. in this study, we have examined the functional
activity of varenicline at a variety of rat neuronal nicotinic receptors expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes and assayed
under two-electrode voltage clamp. we also find that varenicline is a potent, partial agonist at ␣4␤2 receptors, with an ec50
of 2.3 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m and an efficacy (relative to acetylcholine) of

neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) are
ligand-gated ion channels composed of ␣ and ␤ subunits that
assemble to form pentamers with a variety of pharmacological and biophysical properties (corringer et al., 2000). these
receptors are widely distributed in the cns and have been
proposed as potential therapeutic targets for a variety of
conditions and disorders, such as alzheimer’s disease, anxiety, depression, drug addiction, epilepsy, pain, parkinson’s
disease, schizophrenia and tourette’s syndrome (jensen et
al., 2005). the development of subtype selective ligands is an
essential part of attempts to make progress in these areas.
therefore, much effort is currently directed toward synthesizing and screening analogs of various nicotinic compounds
(recently reviewed in jensen et al., 2005). the ␣4␤2 nachr
(and more complex ␣4␤2-containing receptors) is a target of
particular interest for the development of smoking cessation

13.4 ⫾ 0.4%. varenicline has lower potency and higher efficacy
at ␣3␤4 receptors, with an ec50 of 55 ⫾ 8 ␮m and an efficacy
of 75 ⫾ 6%. varenicline also seems to be a weak partial agonist
at ␣3␤2 and ␣6-containing receptors, with an efficacy ⬍10%. it
is remarkable that varenicline is a potent, full agonist at ␣7
receptors with an ec50 of 18 ⫾ 6 ␮m and an efficacy of 93 ⫾
7% (relative to acetylcholine). thus, whereas varenicline is a
partial agonist at some heteromeric neuronal nicotinic receptors, it is a full agonist at the homomeric ␣7 receptor. some
combination of these actions may be involved in the mechanism of varenicline as a smoking cessation aid.

therapies because of the location of this receptor on presynaptic terminals in the striatum and the role of this receptor in
modulating dopamine release (salminen et al., 2004).
 xxxd1792xxx  is a plant alkaloid with a relatively rigid conformation. in equilibrium binding assays,  xxxd1792xxx  is selective
for the ␣4␤2 subunit combination, compared with other important nachr subtypes such as ␣3␤4 and ␣7 (parker et al.,
1998; stauderman et al., 1998; chavez-noriega et al., 2000;
carbonnelle et al., 2003; slater et al., 2003; xiao et al., 2004).
in functional assays,  xxxd1792xxx  shows greater potency at ␣4␤2
receptors than at many other subunit combinations.  xxxd1792xxx 
also displays a wide variation in efficacy at various subunit
combinations. although  xxxd1792xxx  is a high-efficacy agonist at
␣7 receptors and at various ␤4-containing receptors, such as
␣3␤4,  xxxd1792xxx  is a low-efficacy partial agonist at ␣4␤2 and
other ␤2 containing receptors (luetje and patrick, 1991;
papke and heinemann, 1994; chavez-noriega et al., 1997;
stauderman et al., 1998; chavez-noriega et al., 2000; papke
and porter papke, 2002; carbonnelle et al., 2003; slater et

changes in the efficacy at various neuronal nachrs. for

materials and methods
materials. xenopus laevis frogs were purchased from nasco (ft.
atkinson, wi). care and use of x. laevis frogs in this study were
approved by the university of miami animal research committee
and meet the guidelines of the national institutes of health. rna
transcription kits were from ambion (austin, tx). all other chemicals were from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo).
varenicline. 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-6,10-methano-6h pyrazino[2,3h][3]benzazepine (varenicline) was synthesized as the dihydrochloride salt using reported methods (coe and brooks, 2002; brooks et
al., 2004). we thank dr. jotham coe for helpful suggestions. the
structure of varenicline is shown in fig. 1.
expression of neuronal nachrs in x. laevis oocytes. mature x. laevis frogs were anesthetized by submersion in 0.1% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. oocytes were surgically removed, and
follicle cells were removed by treatment with collagenase b for 2 h at
room temperature. crna encoding the rat ␣3, ␣4, ␣6/␣3 (see below),
␣7, ␤2, ␤3, and ␤4 neuronal nachr subunits was synthesized using
mmessage mmachine kits (ambion). oocytes were injected with 10
to 40 ng of crna in 13 to 50 nl of water and incubated at 19°c in
modified barth’s saline [88 mm nacl, 1 mm kcl, 2.4 mm nahco3,
0.3 mm ca(no3)2 0.41 mm cacl2, 0.82 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 100 ␮g/ml
gentamicin, 15 mm hepes, ph 7.6] for 2 to 6 days. for heteromeric
nachrs, crna transcripts encoding each subunit were injected into
oocytes at a molar ratio of 1:1.
neuronal nachrs containing the ␣6 subunit are narrowly distributed, but functionally important, in the mammalian central nervous
system (salminen et al., 2004). unfortunately, receptors containing
this subunit are difficult to functionally express. however a successful strategy has been to use a chimeric subunit consisting of the
n-terminal extracellular domain of ␣6 joined to the transmembrane

and intracellular domains of ␣3 (kuryatov et al., 2000; mcintosh et
al., 2004; azam et al., 2005). this chimeric ␣6/␣3 subunit was kindly
provided by dr. michael mcintosh (university of utah). in accordance with previous reports (mcintosh et al., 2004), we found that
whereas functional expression of the ␣6/␣3 chimera with the ␤2
subunit was very weak, useful levels of functional expression could
be achieved with the inclusion of the ␤3 subunit. indeed, ␣6␤2␤3 is
a functional nachr subtype in the mammalian central nervous
system (salminen et al., 2004).
electrophysiological methods. agonist-induced current responses were measured 2 to 6 days after crna injection using
two-electrode voltage clamp in an automated parallel electrophysiology system (opusexpress 6000a; molecular devices, sunnyvale,
ca). micropipettes were filled with 3 m kcl and had resistances of
0.2 to 2.0 m⍀. current responses were recorded at a holding potential of ⫺40 mv to minimize the contribution of calcium activated
chloride channels. for all receptors except ␣7, current responses
were filtered (four-pole, bessel, low-pass) at 20 hz (⫺3 db) and
sampled at 100 hz. for ␣7 receptors, current responses were filtered
(four-pole, bessel, low-pass) at 100 hz (⫺3 db) and sampled at 500
hz. current responses were captured and stored using opusxpress
1.1 software (molecular devices). initial analysis was done using
clampfit 9.1 software (molecular devices). oocytes were perfused at
room temperature (20–25°c) with ringer’s saline (115 mm nacl, 1.8
mm cacl2, 2.5 mm kcl, 0.0001 mm atropine, and 10 mm hepes,
ph 7.2). for all receptors except ␣7, acetylcholine and varenicline
were applied for 20 s at a flow rate of 4 ml/min, with 3-min washes
between applications. for ␣7 receptors, acetylcholine and varenicline
were applied for 5 s at a flow rate of 4 ml/min, with 3-min washes
between applications. the acetylcholine concentration, applied before each varenicline application, was 20 ␮m for ␣4␤2 (ec30), 110 ␮m
for ␣3␤4 (ec20), 10 ␮m for ␣3␤2 (ec20), 30 ␮m for ␣6/␣3␤2␤3
(⬃ec50), and 300 ␮m for ␣7 (ec50). each current response to varenicline was normalized to the preceding acetylcholine-induced response. dose response data were fit to the equation i ⫽ imax/[1 ⫹
(ec50/x)nh], where i is the current response at agonist concentration
(x), imax is the maximum current, ec50 is the ligand concentration
producing the half-maximal current response, and nh is the hill
coefficient. dose response data for inhibition curves were fit to the
equation i ⫽ imax/[1 ⫹ (x/ic50)nh], where i is the current response at
agonist concentration (x), imax is the maximum current, ic50 is the
ligand concentration producing half-maximal inhibition of the current response, and nh is the hill coefficient.

results and discussion
we first examined the effect of varenicline on rat ␣4␤2
receptors expressed in x. laevis oocytes. application of 100
␮m varenicline yielded a peak current response that was
smaller in amplitude than the response evoked by 20 ␮m
ach (the ec30 for ach), suggesting that varenicline might
have a low efficacy at this receptor (fig. 2b). the response to
this high concentration of varenicline desensitized rapidly
compared with the response to a low concentration of varenicline (1 ␮m, fig. 2a). the small deflection seen when the
varenicline is washed away suggests that in addition to the
desensitizing effect, varenicline may cause a small amount of
channel block. when the ␣4␤2 receptor was challenged with
a range of varenicline concentrations and the current responses were normalized to the maximal response to ach
(see materials and methods), we found that varenicline was
a potent (ec50 ⫽ 2.3 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m) partial agonist with an
efficacy 13.3 ⫾ 0.4% that of ach (fig. 2c). these results are
similar to what has been previously reported for human ␣4␤2
(ec50 ⫽ 2.3 ␮m, efficacy ⫽ 24% relative to nicotine; coe et
al., 2005a). when a range of varenicline concentrations were

example, bromination or iodination of the 3-position in the
pyridone ring of  xxxd1792xxx  preserves the full efficacy at ␣7
receptors and increases the efficacy at ␣4␤2 receptors (slater
et al., 2003), whereas the addition of side groups at the basic
nitrogen of  xxxd1792xxx  can reduce or eliminate efficacy for various receptors (carbonnelle et al., 2003).
varenicline is a recently developed nicotinic ligand that
has recently been approved by the u.s. food and drug administration for use as a smoking cessation therapy (coe et
al., 2005a,b,c; obach et al., 2006). the structure of varenicline (fig. 1) is loosely based on that of  xxxd1792xxx  and it was the
partial agonist activity of  xxxd1792xxx  that was one of the initial
characteristics that led to the development of varenicline
(coe et al., 2005a,b,c). in equilibrium binding assays, varenicline is selective for the ␣4␤2 receptor compared with ␣3␤4,
␣7, and muscle-like nachrs, whereas in a functional assay,
varenicline is a partial agonist at ␣4␤2 receptors (coe et al.,
2005a). in this study, we examined the functional potency
and efficacy of varenicline at several neuronal nachr subunit combinations. we found that varenicline displayed only
moderate differences in functional potency but showed wide
variation in efficacy at these receptors.

receptors (fig. 3c). varenicline was 24-fold less potent at
␣3␤4 receptors (ec50 ⫽ 55 ⫾ 8 ␮m) than at ␣4␤2 receptors.
we also examined the efficacy of varenicline at ␣3␤2 receptors and ␣6-containing receptors (as represented by an
␣6/␣3 chimera coexpressed with the ␤2 and ␤3 subunits, see
materials and methods). when 100 ␮m varenicline was applied to oocytes expressing ␣3␤2 receptors, current responses
were 3.7 ⫾ 0.4% of the maximal ach response. this was a
saturating response, in that 1 mm varenicline did not yield
larger current responses (data not shown). thus, varenicline
is a low-efficacy partial agonist at ␣3␤2 receptors, with an
ec50 ⬍ 100 ␮m. varenicline also displayed low efficacy on
the ␣6/␣3␤2␤3 receptor, with 100 ␮m varenicline yielding
responses that were 8.8 ⫾ 1.4% of the maximal response to
ach. again, this seems to be a saturating response, because
the response to 10 ␮m varenicline was similar (data not
shown).
although varenicline proved to be a partial agonist at
many of the neuronal nachr subtypes that we tested, the
effect of varenicline was remarkably different at ␣7 containing receptors. when 100 ␮m varenicline was applied to ␣7
expressing oocytes, peak current responses were substantially larger than the responses to 300 ␮m ach (the ec50),
suggesting that varenicline has high efficacy at these receptors (fig. 4a). this was borne out when we applied a range of
varenicline concentrations to ␣7-expressing oocytes. varenicline was a potent full agonist, activating ␣7 receptors with
an ec50 of 18 ⫾ 6 ␮m and an efficacy that was 93 ⫾ 7% of the
maximal response to ach (fig. 4, a and b). the rapid desensitization kinetics of the ␣7 receptor at all agonist concentrations has raised concerns about the use peak current measurements to study the ␣7 receptor and an alternate method,
net charge analysis, has been proposed (papke and porter
papke, 2002). when using net charge analysis, the ec50 for

coapplied with ach (40 ␮m, the ec60), we found that varenicline can antagonize the ach response with an ic50 of 0.2 ⫾
0.03 ␮m (fig. 2d), consistent with the idea that varenicline is
a potent partial agonist of ␣4␤2 receptors.
next, we examined the action of varenicline on other neuronal nachr subtypes. application of 200 ␮m varenicline to
an oocyte expressing ␣3␤4 receptors yielded a peak current
response with an amplitude substantially larger than the
response evoked by 110 ␮m ach (the ec20 for ach), suggesting that varenicline might have a high efficacy at this receptor (fig. 3b). the response to this high concentration of
varenicline desensitized rapidly, compared with the response
to a lower concentration of varenicline (30 ␮m, fig. 3a). the
small deflection seen when the varenicline is washed away
suggests that in addition to the desensitizing effect, varenicline may cause a small amount of channel block. when the
␣3␤4 receptor was challenged with a range of varenicline
concentrations and the current responses normalized to the
maximal response to ach (see materials and methods), we
found that varenicline had an efficacy of 75 ⫾ 6% at these

et al., 1997, 2000; stauderman et al., 1998; papke and porter

compared with  xxxd1792xxx , varenicline has a similarly low efficacy at ␣4␤2 and other ␤2-containing receptors and a similarly high efficacy at ␣3␤4 and ␣7 receptors.
we have characterized the pharmacological properties of
varenicline using rat neuronal nachrs. thus, it is important
to consider how our results may relate to the actions of
varenicline at human receptors. as discussed above, varenicline displays similar potency and efficacy values at both rat
and human ␣4␤2 receptors (table 1) (coe et al., 2005a). in
addition,  xxxd1792xxx  displays similar potencies and efficacies on
both rat and human ␣4␤2, ␣3␤4, and ␣7 receptors (chaveznoriega et al., 1997; papke and porter papke, 2002; carbonnelle et al., 2003). thus, the actions of varenicline on rat
neuronal nachrs that we describe here are likely to be
relevant to the actions of varenicline on human receptors.
all of the actions of varenicline should be taken into account when considering a potential mechanism for smoking
cessation. varenicline is a potent partial agonist at ␣4␤2
receptors, a less potent high efficacy agonist at ␣3␤4 receptors, a partial agonist at ␣3␤2 and ␣6-containing receptors,
and a potent full agonist at ␣7 receptors. the involvement of
presynaptic ␣4- and ␣6-containing receptors in regulating
dopamine release in the striatum (salminen et al., 2004),
makes the partial agonism of varenicline at these receptors
an attractive potential mechanism (coe et al., 2005a). however, the potent high efficacy activation of ␣7 receptors may
also be important. in addition, because therapeutic use of
varenicline involves long-term exposure, it may be that it is
the greater affinity of varenicline for the ␣4␤2 receptor in the
desensitized state(s) that is important. that is, varenicline
may have a selectively greater ability to maintain ␣4␤2 receptors in a desensitized state. although it is possible that
one of these actions is critical, it is also possible that that
some combination of these actions might work in concert to
achieve a desirable smoking cessation outcome. regardless of
the exact mechanism of action, it is ultimately the results of
clinical trials that determine the usefulness of varenicline as
a smoking cessation therapeutic. it should also be noted that
the potent, high-efficacy agonism of the ␣7 receptor suggests
that varenicline may have utility as a treatment of such
disorders as schizophrenia and alzheimer’s disease (jensen
et al., 2005).

ach is greatly reduced and 300 ␮m ach becomes a saturating concentration (papke and porter papke, 2002). when we
examine the actions of varenicline on ␣7 receptors using net
charge analysis, we again find that varenicline is a potent,
high efficacy agonist, with an ec50 of 2.3 ⫾ 0.2 ␮m and an
efficacy of 84 ⫾ 2%.
we find relatively modest differences in the functional
potency of varenicline at several neuronal nachrs. the ec50
for varenicline activation of ␣4␤2 is 2.3 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m, whereas
varenicline was 8- and 24-fold less potent at ␣7 and ␣3␤4
receptors, respectively. these results contrast with the high
degree of selectivity reported for varenicline at ␣4␤2 compared with ␣7 and ␣3␤4 receptors (coe et al., 2005a). however, in this earlier study, it is the equilibrium binding affinity of varenicline that is being compared. in this context,
varenicline is highly selective for ␣4␤2, displaying an affinity
that is 4000- and ⬎5000-fold greater than the affinities for
the ␣3␤4 and ␣7 subtypes, respectively. the binding affinity
derived from this type of assay is primarily the affinity of the
ligand for the desensitized state(s) of the receptor. unfortunately, large differences in affinity observed in equilibrium
binding assays are generally not observed in functional assays, and the rank order of affinities do not necessarily correlate with the rank orders of functional potency or efficacy
(avalos et al., 2002; jensen et al., 2005). thus, we find that
the functional potency of varenicline at ␣4␤2, ␣3␤4, and ␣7
receptors varies by 24-fold or less. more interesting is the
variation in efficacy, which ranges from low (⬍15% for ␣4␤2,
␣3␤2, and ␣6-containing receptors), to high (93% and 75% for
␣7 and ␣3␤4 receptors, respectively). this variation in efficacy is not surprising considering that the initial inspiration
for the development of varenicline was  xxxd1792xxx  (coe et al.,
2005a), an agonist that displays low efficacy at ␣4␤2 receptors and high efficacy at ␣3␤4 and ␣7 receptors (luetje and
