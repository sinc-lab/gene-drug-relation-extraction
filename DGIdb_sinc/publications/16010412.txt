potential of endogenous  xxxg730xxx  beta to influence the selective er modulator  xxxg731xxx  complex.  the ratio of  xxxg730xxx  beta ( xxxg731xxx ) to  xxxg730xxx  can alter the estrogen-like properties of tamoxifen. transient transfection of  xxxg731xxx  cdna into cells can decrease the estrogen-like properties of the  xxxg730xxx :tamoxifen complex, whereas an increase in the amount of  xxxg731xxx  is associated with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. we have addressed each of these hypotheses by examining well characterized laboratory models. we determined whether changes in endogenous  xxxg731xxx  are responsible for the estrogen-like or antiestrogenic properties of tamoxifen or raloxifene in mda-mb-231 cells transfected with cdnas for  xxxg730xxx  or mutants d351g, d351y. we found that the amount of  xxxg731xxx  mrna in separate, stable transfectants of mutant  xxxg730xxx  cdna was always < 2% of  xxxg730xxx . since at least a 50:50 mixture of  xxxg730xxx : xxxg731xxx  is needed to silence the tamoxifen: xxxg730xxx  complex, we conclude that insufficient  xxxg731xxx  mrna is available for selective er modulation in stable transfectants of d351g and d351y  xxxg730xxx . similarly, to test the hypothesis that  xxxg731xxx  is up-regulated and plays an important role during the development of tamoxifen-stimulated tumor growth, we quantitatively analyzed  xxxg731xxx  and  xxxg730xxx  mrna in tamoxifen-naïve (mcf-7:e2, ecc1:e2) and tamoxifen-stimulated tumors (mcf-7:tam, enca 101:tam). we found that  xxxg731xxx  mrna levels were not significantly elevated in tamoxifen-stimulated tumors and the  xxxg730xxx  mrna remained over 99% out of all er species for all the tumors tested. the same results were also obtained when mrna levels of  xxxg731xxx  and  xxxg730xxx  in a series of tamoxifen-naïve and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer was analyzed. we conclude that endogenous  xxxg731xxx  may not play a dominant role in the modulation of the tamoxifen  xxxg730xxx  complex, or in the development of tamoxifen-stimulated resistant tumor growth.
