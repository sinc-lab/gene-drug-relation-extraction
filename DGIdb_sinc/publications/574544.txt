4 in table iv). with the parameter estimates, the computer-fitted excretion rate values ( r e ) and residual values listed in columns 4 and 5
of table 111were obtained. these values indicate that the interaction
between iodoxamic acid and iapanoic acid in the liver can be described
by the ligand exclusion model. in such a model, iopanoic acid acts as an
inhibitor and competes with iodoxamic acid for binding to either of two
identical sites within the liver, which presumably is the rate-limiting step
in the liver’s overall elimination of these radiographic contrast agents.
however, because of the large standard error of the mean of the estimated
values of k , and k,, the fit may be fortuitous. further studies will be
required to investigate this tentative conclusion.
presumably, the experimental method and the data analysis used in
the present investigation can be applied to the study of the interactions
between other compounds (e.g., indocyanine green, sulfobromophthalein,
propranolol, lidocaine, and propoxyphene) that have high hepatic excretion. to apply this approach, one must have assay procedures for each
compound independently and be able to measure the unbound concentrations in plasma water.

abstract 0 progress in the development of radioimmunoassay techniques for reserpine and related compounds is reported. a conjugate of
reserpine with human  xxxg124xxx  was prepared, involving linkage
at the indole nitrogen atom of reserpine. injection of the purified conjugate into sheep elicited antibodies of high titer, which bound reserpine
selectively. tritiated reserpine was employed in the procedure, and
dextran-coated charcoal was utilized to separate free and bound forms
of‘the drug. antibodies exhibited a selectivity for reserpine and did not
cross-react significantly with major human metabolites. cross-reactivity
of antibodies with other reserpine derivatives ( i z , syrosingopine,
 xxxd1843xxx , and  xxxd3099xxx ) also was investigated. a stable tritiated
or radioiodinated reserpine derivative of high specific activity is being
sought. to improve assay sensitivity for use in bioequivalence and bioavailability studies. in the absence of any extraction or concentration
procedures, at least a 10-foldincrease in immunoassay sensitivity would
he required to follow reserpine levels in humans given normal doses of
the drug. the methods show promise also for the assay of reserpine derivatives such as  xxxd1843xxx , which exhibits cross-reactivityto reserpine
antibodies.

and no interference from major metabolites. application
of the method in human bioavailability and bioequivalence
studies, without preliminary extraction procedures, has
been limited by sensitivity. this limitation results from
the instability of tritiated reserpine of high specific activity. experience in this laboratory with reserpine immunoassay development has been entirely analogous, but
the method holds promise if a suitable tritiated or iodinated reserpine analog can be prepared.
earlier reserpine assays, which were reviewed recently
(2, 3), are useful for certain applications but involve
time-consuming separations and extractions and have
inadequate sensitivity and specificity for reserpine determinations in plasma or urine. a recent method (4) is
reportedly sensitive to 200 pg/ml and, perhaps, to 50 pg/ml
with less confidence. however, this procedure is indirect,
involving extraction followed by tlc and a fluorometric
densitometer scan. recovery during extraction may be
variable and must be established.
the purposes of this report are to compare specificities
of antiserums produced in these laboratories during immunoassay development with the work of levy et al. (1)
and to discuss the potential utility of reserpine antiserums
in the immunoassay of commercially available reserpine
analogs such as  xxxd1843xxx  and  xxxd3099xxx .

it commercial liquid scintillation fluidfi, deserpidine7, rescinnamine2,
syrosingopine8, methylreserpate8, reserpic acid8, and 3h-reserpineg.
tritium counting was performed using a liquid scintillation spectrometer
with automatic external standardization to enable computation of efficiency and disintegrations per minute of individual samplesi0.
reserpine conjugation with h u m a n s e r u m albumin (antigen
preparation)-to 5 pci of 3h-reserpine in 2 ml of ethanol was added
1.50 rng of reserpine. after solvent removal in uacuo, the solid was disholved in 3.6 ml of acetic acid and added to 400 mg of human serum alhumin in 4 ml of distilled water. to the resulting clear solution was added
2.4 ml of38% formaldehyde, and the mixture was warmed at 50" under
nitrogen for 1 hr. solvents were removed in uacuo a t room temperature
( 10 hr), and the residue was slurried in 10 ml of 5% sodium bicarbonate,
collected by centrifugation, washed several times with 50% ethanol, and
dried.
the solid product was thoroughly washed with chloroform-methanol
(1:1) until no further reserpine appeared in the washings as determined
hy counting tracer radioactivity. digestion of 2-mg samples of the 350
mg of conjugate obtained was carried out on a steam bath in a mixture
(11 10 drops of 30%  xxxd2298xxx  and 30 drops of 70% perchloric acid,
and the digest was counted in a scintillation cocktail. two separate determinations indicated 4.1 and 4.0 moles of reserpine/rnole of human
herum albumin (based on mol. wt. 70,000).

-7-10 days after each booster injection. serum, prepared by the usual
procedures, was tested for reserpine-binding ability using 10 or 2 ng of
"h-reserpine, according t o the procedure described later.
both sheep responded similarly to the conjugate, producing antiserum
of usable titer (i,e,, 1:500-700 with 10 ng of 3h-reserpine and 1:3000 with
2 ng of' "h-reserpine) after 2-3 months. bleedings taken subsequently
up to 18 months maintained approximately equivalent titers and specificity. in experiments described later, serum from one sheep (lt 7-8-76)
was employed.

was added to each tube.
tubes were incubated at 37o for 2 hr and chilled in ice for 30 min, and
0.6 ml of dextran-coated charcoal suspension (table i, footnote /) was
added to desired tubes. after vortexing, suspensions were left at oo for
exactly 15 min and then centrifuged a t 2' for 10 min. exactly 1.0 ml of
the supernate was removed carefully by automatic pipet and counted in
10 ml olscintillation cocktail in a counting vial. percent binding figures
were calculated. nonspecific binding (-5%) was subtracted from the total
prrcentage figures observed. the entire procedure was essentially identical to that described previously for methotrexate (5).
typical standard curves obtained for two different antiserum dilutions

lmmunogen an d antiserum preparation-by employing a modification of a literature procedure (7), reserpine was coupled through the
indole nitrogen uia formaldehyde treatment in acetic acid to lysine
groupings of human  xxxg124xxx . the inclusion of tracer quantities
ol' "h-reserpine enabled estimation of the conjugate reserpine content
st 4 moles/mole of human  xxxg124xxx . this level compares closely
10 the "mannich-type" conjugation carried out in  xxxd1896xxx 
(using hovine  xxxg124xxx ) by levy et al. ( l ) ,which gave a haptencarrier ratio of' about 5. the coupling site a t the indole nitrogen of reserpine appears to be ideal since major metabolic (hydrolytic) transformation sites, the trirnethoxybenzoyl group a t position 18 and the methyl
cster at position 16 (table ii), remain unmasked as potential immunodeterminant groups, and the resultant antibodies should be able to distinguish reserpine from its major metabolic products reserpic acid,
met hylreserpate, and trimethoxybenzoic acid (8).
each of two sheep responded similarly to initial antigen injections and
monthly boosters. after 3 months, antiserum of usable titer (1:500-700
as determined using 10 ng of:'h-reserpine and 1:3000 using 2 ng of :'hreserpine) resulted; these titers remained essentially constant over the
15 additional months during which the hoosters were maintained. in

comparison with these results, levy et al. (1)reported a maximal titer
of only 1:loo (1 ng of 3h-reserpine) with their mannich-type immunogen
and eventually based their immunoassay on higher titer antiserum that
originated from a “diazo-type” conjugate coupled in the indole benzene
ring.
standard immunoassay curve-with the components described
in table i and the conditions discussed under experimental, typical
standard immunoassay curves (fig. 1) were obtained. points were usually
determined in triplicate, with a coefficient of variation of <8%in all cases
when 10 ng of 3h-reserpine was used. the position and shape of the curve
were not influenced appreciably by the addition of u p to 10% (0.1 ml) of
human plasma, serum, or cerebrospinal fluid. with 2 ng of ”-reserpine,
increased error was observed (fig. 1).
because of interest in obtaining radiolabeled material of higher specific
activity (producing increased sensitivity), exhaustive work has not been
carried out to determine optimum conditions for the assay with the
available tritiated reserpine of low specific activity. the obvious deficiency of the system employing commercially available 3h-reserpine is
sensitivity insufficient to reach levels normally found (estimated by gross
radioactivity measurements) in human subjects. these levels are 0.2-2.0
ng/ml according to one study after a single oral 0.25-mg dose (9). levy
et at. (11, using 3h-reserpine of specific activity 1.7 ci/mmole (of limited
stability but -10 times that available commercially), apparently encountered similar difficulties, with sensitivity limited to -15 ng/ml of
plasma, unless tripp’s extraction procedure was employed for primary
reserpine concentration in the sample. in this laboratory, iodination
procedures with iodine 125 have been unsuccessful, and similar difficulties were reported by levy et al. (1).
cross-reactivity studies (specificity determinations)-the
major reserpine metabolites as well as several semisynthetic analogs were
studied for their ability to dispjace 3h-reserpine from antibody binding
sites under the conditions outlined earlier. metabolites were reserpic acid,
methylreserpate, and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid; commercially
available synthetic analogs were  xxxd3099xxx , syrosingopine, and
 xxxd1843xxx  (table 11). results (table 111) are expressed as the ratio of‘
the amount of compound to the amount of reserpine producing 50%
binding inhibition (also expressed as percent cross-reactivity, derived
from the reciprocal of the ratio in question). these figures were obtained
uia logit transformation linearization of sigmoid curves such as those
shown in fig. 1 (6).
the results in table 111 indicate that major reserpine metaholites in
humans, specifically reserpic acid, methylreserpate, and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid, do not cross-react to any significant extent (<0.6%)
with reserpine antibodies. similar results were obtained by levy et at.
(1) using both their mannich-type immunogen and a preferable “higher
titer” antiserum involving coupling of bovine  xxxg124xxx  through
an azobenzoyl linkage adjacent to the 11-methoxy substituent of reser-

pine. such results with all three conjugates are expected, because coupling
sites are remote from the metabolism sites at the 16- and 18-positions;
i.e., these groups are left free as immunodeterminants in the hapten.
of particular interest is the observation that  xxxd1843xxx , which differs
from reserpine only in the absence of an 11-methoxy grouping, was bound
to antibody prepared in this work nearly as well as reserpine (75%
cross-reactivity), indicating that the 11-position on the aromatic ring,
which is rather close to the n-1 indole nitrogen atom, the point of coupling, is thus hindered as an immunodeterminant group in antibody
formation. this observed cross-reactivity is of special interest as a potential basis for a  xxxd1843xxx  immunoassay. little cross-reactivity was
observed between antiserum and the two additional synthetic reserpine
analogs, syrosingopine (0.2%) and  xxxd3099xxx  (2.6%), although the
latter was bound significantly to the roche antibody (“mannich immunogen,” 20% cross-reactivity).
such specificity studies, especially if combined with a stable tritiated
or iodinated reserpine derivative (or one of the other drugs mentioned),
could contribute valuahle methodology for bioavailability, bioequivalence, and metabolism studies of reserpine or its analogs.
