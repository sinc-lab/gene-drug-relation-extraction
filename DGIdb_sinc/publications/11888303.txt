abstract: the active sites of the homologous  xxxd3047xxx - (plp-) dependent enzymes
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) synthase and aspartate aminotransferase (aatase) are almost
entirely conserved, yet the pka’s of the two internal aldimines are 9.3 and 7.0, respectively, to complement
the substrate pka’s ( xxxd3156xxx  pka ) 7.8 and aspartate pka ) 9.9). this complementation is
required for maximum enzymatic activity in the physiological ph range. the most prominent structural
difference in the active site is that ile232 of acc synthase is replaced by alanine in aatase. the i232a
mutation was introduced into acc synthase with a resulting 1.1 unit decrease (from 9.3 to 8.2) in the
aldimine pka, thus identifying ile232 as a major determinant of the high pka of acc synthase. the
mutation also resulted in reduced kcat (0.5 vs 11 s-1) and kcat/km values (5.0 × 104 vs 1.2 × 106 m-1 s-1).
the effect of the mutation is interpreted as the result of shortening of the tyr233-plp hydrogen bond.
addition of the y233f mutation to the i232a acc synthase to generate the double mutant i232a/y233f
raised the pka from 8.2 to 8.8, because the y233f mutation eliminates the hydrogen bond between that
residue and plp. the introduction of the retro mutation a224i into aatase raised the aldimine pka of
that enzyme from 6.96 to 7.16 and resulted in a decrease in single-turnover kmax (108 vs 900 s-1 for
aspartate) and kmax/kmapp (7.5 × 104 vs 3.8 × 105 m-1 s-1) values. the distance from the pyridine nitrogen
of the cofactor to a conserved aspartate residue is 2.6 å in aatase and 3.8 å in acc synthase. the
d230e mutation introduced into acc synthase to close this distance increases the aldimine pka from 9.3
to 10.0, as would be predicted from a shortened hydrogen bond.

the group of plp-dependent enzymes designated subgroup i aminotransferases by sequence analysis (1) and
aminotransferase subclass i by structural analysis (2) has five
members. all but one of these catalyze transamination, the
interconversion of r-amino and r-keto acids. the exception
is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc)1 synthase
(s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx   xxxd2619xxx  lyase, ec
4.4.1.14), which catalyzes a 1,3-elimination of 5′- xxxd2619xxx  (mta) from s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  (sam)
(scheme 1). the recently solved crystal structure of acc
synthase (3) shows remarkable structural similarity of this
enzyme to aspartate aminotransferase (aspartate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase,  xxxg934xxx   xxxg1621xxx   xxxg1742xxx .1, aatase), its closest
relative in the group. the greatest correspondence is in the
region around the cofactor binding site. the active site
residues are conserved between the two enzymes with the

exception of isoleucine 232, which is alanine 224 in aatase
(scheme 2).
despite the conservation of residues around the plp, the
enzyme-bound cofactors of each enzyme have strikingly
different uv spectra at neutral ph (figure 1), a result of the
different pka’s of the enzyme-plp schiff base [7.0 for
aatase (4) and 9.3 for acc synthase (5)]. the unprotonated
schiff bases absorb maximally at ∼360 nm (aatase) or
∼385 nm (acc synthase), while the protonated forms of
both enzymes absorb maximally at ∼420-430 nm (figure
1). the spectra are therefore ph dependent, and the pka of
the aldimine can be determined by spectrophotometric
titration. plots of kcat/km vs ph for these enzymes exhibit
two pka’s, one of which matches the spectrophotometrically
determined pka and is therefore attributed to the internal
aldimine (6). the second corresponds to the substrate amino
group. the ph of optimum activity lies between the two
pka’s, i.e., when the enzyme aldimine is protonated but the
substrate amino group is not (acc synthase) or vice versa
(aatase). this situation is optimal because the initial

that of the substrate so that an optimum ph near the
physiological ph value is realized.
although some factors have been identified as having a
role in the control of the aldimine pka, the source of the
large difference between the pka’s of these enzymes is not
fully understood. we address here the role of the residues
in contact with the plp cofactor in controlling this pka,
focusing primarily on the variant residue ile232 (acc
synthase)/ala224 (aatase) (scheme 2) and its effect on the
interactions of the cofactor with other residues.
experimental procedures

a all active site residues shown are conserved between these two
enzymes except the highlighted ile232 (acc synthase), which is ala224
in aatase. the aatase residue numbers are in parentheses. tyr70
of aatase (dashed) occupies a significantly different position in the
structure from the homologous acc synthase residue, tyr85.

figure 1: ph dependence of the absorption spectra of wt acc
synthase (solid line) and aatase (dashed line). the spectra were
taken at ph 10.4 (a), 7.5 (b), and 6.1 (c). the wavelengths of
maximum absorbance for acc synthase are 420 nm (low ph) and
385 nm (high ph), and those for aatase are 430 nm (low ph)
and 360 nm (high ph).

transaldmination step of the transamination reaction requires
that the aldimine electrophile be protonated while the amino
acid nucleophile is in the free base form. although the
reverse is true in the situation described for aatase, the
necessary proton distribution requires only a single proton
transfer from the substrate to the aldimine. in each case, the
enzyme pka must be modulated to be far enough away from

results
the i232a mutation decreases the aldimine pka of acc
synthase and results in a kinetically compromised enzyme.
replacement of the active site residue ile232 of acc
synthase with alanine, which is found in the corresponding
position in aatase, results in a decrease in the pka of the
enzyme-plp internal aldimine to a value approaching that
of the latter enzyme. spectrophotometric titration of i232a
acc synthase shows a pka of 8.0 (figure 2a) compared to
9.26 for wt acc synthase (5). the plot of kcat/km vs ph
exhibits two pka’s, 7.5 and 8.2 (figure 3). the former
matches that of the substrate r-amino group (5), while the
latter is equal to that of the enzyme internal aldimine. the
corresponding pka’s in the kcat/km profile of the wt acc
synthase are 7.5 and 8.9 (5). the small difference between
the kinetic and spectrophotometric aldimine pka of the wt
enzyme is due to irreversible loss of activity at high ph that
is not the result of aldimine deprotonation (d. mccarthy,
unpublished results). for this reason, the spectrophotometric
determination provides the more reliable measure of the pka
of the aldimine. thus the ile f ala mutation decreases the
aldimine pka by a full pk unit, marking this residue as one
of the major determinants of the aldimine pka difference
observed between acc synthase and aatase.
the mutant exhibits a reduced kcat value of 0.5 s-1 at ph
8.0 [vs 11.0 s-1 for wt (5)], but km is unchanged, resulting
in a kcat/km of 5.0 × 104 m-1 s-1 (table 1). although this
maximum observed kcat/km value is 20-fold below that of
the wt enzyme, the theoretical maximum determined from
the fit of the data shown in figure 3 to eq 3 is 9.4 × 104
m-1 s-1, 10-fold reduced from wt.

the a224i mutation increases the aldimine pka of aatase
and reduces catalytic activity. alanine 224 is the aatase
active site residue that occupies a position equivalent to
ile232 in acc synthase (scheme 2). the introduction of
the mutation a224i into aatase results in a small but
reproducible pka increase from 6.96 in wt aatase to 7.16
(figure 2b). although the magnitude of the change is much
smaller than that of the reverse i232a mutation in acc
synthase, the shift is in the anticipated direction toward that
of wt acc synthase. the effect on the enzyme activity is
also moderate: the kmax values for single turnover of both
aspartate and glutamate are reduced approximately 9-fold,
but the apparent km’s for both substrates are reduced by
nearly half, resulting in kmax/kmapp values that are only 4-fold
less than that of wt (table 1).
this mutant also exhibits an absorbance spectrum that is
slightly different from that of wt. at low ph, the absorbance
at 320 nm is increased and that at 430 nm is reduced relative
to wt. at high ph, this mutant is unique in retaining a
significant absorbance at 430 nm, suggesting that the enzyme
internal aldimine is only two-thirds deprotonated at high ph
(figure 2b).
the y233f mutation in i232a acc synthase results in a
pka that nearly matches that of aatase y225f and

partially rescues the reduced kcat of the i232a construct
in acc synthase. the double mutant i232a/y233f acc
synthase exhibits a spectrophotometric pka of 8.8 (figure
2c), which is 0.6 unit above that of i232a acc synthase
and 1.4 units lower than that of y233f. kinetically, this
mutant enzyme has an elevated km of 57 µm and a kcat of
2.2 s-1 (4-fold higher than the value of 0.5 s-1 in the single
mutant i232a), resulting in a kcat/km of 4 × 104 m-1 s-1,
which is comparable to those values recorded for the single
mutants i232a (5 × 104 m-1 s-1) and y233f (5.1 × 104
m-1 s-1) (table 1).
the d230e mutation results in a 0.7 unit increase in
the aldimine pka and stabilizes the quinonoid intermediate
in the reaction with sam. the spectrophotometric pka of
the d230e mutant of acc synthase is 9.95 (figure 2d, table
1). the activity of this mutant is lower than that of the other
active site mutants discussed above, with a kcat value of 0.7
s-1 and a kcat/km value of 1.3 × 104 m-1 s-1 at ph 8.5. the
asp f glu mutation also results in the accumulation of a
relatively stable quinonoid intermediate upon reaction with
sam. the rate of formation of the intermediate is 100 s-1,
which matches that observed for wt (8), but the rate constant
for the decay of the intermediate, which is the ratedetermining step in the reaction, is much less (0.6 vs 10 s-1);
therefore the quinonoid intermediate accumulates (figure 4).
discussion
the following discussion considers the roles of residues
asp230, ile232, and tyr233 in modulating the aldimine pka
of acc synthase, which is significantly higher (9.3) than
that of the homologous aatase (7.0). these three residues
correspond to asp222, ala224, and tyr225, respectively, of
aatase (scheme 2). the effects of mutations of tyr225(233) in both enzymes (4, 5) and of asp222 in aatase (9)
have been described. the present focus is primarily on the

enzymes, ile232/ala224.
effects of the i232a mutation in acc synthase and the
reverse a224i substitution in aatase on the pka values
and the kinetic parameters. capitani et al. (3) postulated,
from the crystal structure of acc synthase, that the added
bulk of ile232 (vs ala224 in aatase) might be responsible
in part for the large difference in the aldimine pka values,
because the presence of the larger side chain results in a
lengthening of ∼0.2 å of the hydrogen bond between the 3′
oxygen of the cofactor and the side chain of tyr233 (tyr225
in aatase) (scheme 2), although this difference is within
the error of the structure resolution. consistent with this
suggestion is the observation that mutation of this isoleucine
to alanine, which should allow the hydrogen bond to shorten,
does indeed result in a decrease in the aldimine pka of acc
synthase, from 9.3 to 8.2 (table 1). thus ile232 is identified
as a major determinant of the high aldimine pka value of
this enzyme.
there is a concomitant decrease in the activity of the
enzyme associated with this mutation. the kcat/km value for
the mutant is more than 20-fold less than that of wt at the
optimum ph value. most of this effect is due to a decrease
in kcat, presumably because the substrate-plp complex is
no longer positioned optimally in the active site. the mutant
enzyme is also unstable at high ph, as evidenced by the
visible denaturation during the spectrophotometric ph titration (figure 2a). instability of the deprotonated form of the
enzyme has also been observed to a lesser extent in the wt
enzyme and may be due to dissociation of the cofactor.
the introduction of isoleucine into aatase at the equivalent position (replacing ala224) likewise results in a change
of the aldimine pka in the anticipated direction. in this case,
however, the change is small, from 6.96 to 7.16, suggesting
that the cofactor may not be displaced significantly to the
acc synthase orientation in the active site to accommodate
the large isoleucine side chain. thus the effect of the
isoleucine/alanine exchange is context dependent (10). the
values of both kcat and km are reduced in a224i aatase,
resulting in only a small (∼4-5-fold) net decrease in kcat/
km (table 1).
spectrophotometric considerations. spectrophotometric
titrations of subclass i aminotransferases generally exhibit
maxima near 430 nm at low ph attributed to the protonated
aldimine (6, 11). with increasing ph, this absorbance is
replaced, usually with a single isosbestic point, by a peak at
360-390 nm, which is attributed to the deprotonated
aldimine. no other species are observed. the titration of the
a224i mutant of aatase is anomalous in this respect in
that a second peak at 325 nm is observed at low ph, and the
430 nm peak retains ∼30% of its intensity at high ph (figure
2b, scheme 3). the enolimine tautomer ii of aldimine i
absorbs maximally near 320 nm (6), so the observed 325
nm absorbance is likely due to this species; however, it is
possible that this absorbance arises from a loss of conjugation
of the imine with the pyridine ring such as would occur from
nucleophilic addition to the schiff base. the only known
a430 species is the protonated aldimine; thus the high ph
a430 form results from deprotonation of an amino acid side
chain, most likely tyr225 (iv). since the spectrophotometric
titration exhibits a single isosbestic point, species i and ii
and species iii and iv must be in rapid equilibrium. species

scheme 3: forms of the enzyme-bound plp of the a224i mutant of aatase cofactor at high and low ph

ii and iv would exist in the a224i mutant because of the
weakened hydrogen bond between the 3′ oxygen and tyr225
effected by the introduced isoleucine. this would increase
the basicity of the 3′ oxygen as well as the acidity of tyr225.
the lost hydrogen bond in iv vs iii results in an increased
imine pka. an increase in aldimine pka is also achieved with
the y225f mutation in wt aatase (4; table 1).
the free imine forms (ii and iii) of the enzyme are the
active ones, so ∼30% of the reduced kmax/kmapp of the mutant
can be attributed to the presence of species iv at the ph of
optimum activity, which is above the aldimine pka. the 40%
reduction in apparent km effected by the mutation shows that
substrate binding is more favorable in the mutant than in
wt. the y225f mutation of aatase similarly elicits a 20fold reduction in km (4). the explanation was described as
a “tug of war” in which the tyr225 hydroxyl group competes
with the substrate for the cofactor (scheme 4). elimination
of this hydrogen bond therefore results in a more favorable
association with the substrate, because it no longer competes
with the tyrosine for plp. weakening of the same hydrogen
bond via the a224i mutation accomplishes the same result.
is the effect of ile232 limited to the tyr-plp hydrogen
bond? while it is clear that the i232a mutation in acc
synthase makes the active site more like that of aatase,
this construct is an imperfect mimic in that the pka of i232a
acc synthase of 8.2 remains higher than that of wt
aatase, which is 7.0. thus the hydrogen bond made with
the cofactor from tyr233 in the i232a construct is probably
not as strong as that present in wt aatase. this conclusion
is supported by the observation that elimination of that bond
by a tyr f phe mutation raises the aatase pka by 1.6 units
(4), while that of the i232a/y233f double mutant is raised
only 0.6 unit above that of the single i232a mutant. further
evidence that the i232a mutant of acc synthase is
suboptimal for catalytic function is provided by the finding
that this mutation reduces the catalytic activity over wt and
that some of this loss is restored by the second mutation

(table 1). in contrast, the y225f mutation decreases both
the kcat and kcat/km values of wt aatase (4).
the remaining puzzling observation is that the y233f
mutant of acc synthase raises the pka by 0.9 unit (5) above
wt, but the introduction of the same mutation into i232a
acc synthase only raises the pka by 0.6 unit, contrary to
expectation if the hydrogen bond is indeed stronger in the
i232a mutant than in wt. this result indicates that other
features of the active site contribute substantially to control
of the aldimine pka. hayashi and co-workers (12, 13) have
proposed that the major determinant of the aldimine pka of
aatase (and by extension other enzymes in this family) is
the imine-pyridine torsion angle and the resulting degree
of conjugation between the two. in this model, the role of

3842 biochemistry, vol. 41, no. 11, 2002
tyr225 would be to impose a geometric constraint by holding
the cofactor in a specific position rather than significantly
altering the electronic structure of the pyridine ring. the size
of the isoleucine side chain might also act to change the
geometry of the cofactor, affecting the pka in a manner
independent of the tyr233-plp hydrogen bond. this
hypothesis is consistent with the observation that the i232a/
y233f double mutant of acc synthase has a pka remarkably
close to that of y225f aatase (8.8 vs 8.6) rather than
y233f acc synthase (10.2). at this point, the structure of
acc synthase has not been determined at high enough
resolution to investigate this possibility.
what is the role of asp230? the crystal structure of acc
synthase indicates that the distance between asp230 and the
protonated pyridinium nitrogen of the cofactor is 1.2 å longer
(3.8 vs 2.6 å) than the corresponding distance in aatase
(3). this difference is initially surprising, as the longer
distance interaction should result in a lower acc synthase
pka compared to that of aatase. the d230e mutation was
introduced in an attempt to reduce this distance, resulting in
the anticipated increase in the aldimine pka from 9.3 to 10.0.
the increase is a result of increased electron density in the
ring as a result of the closer association with the carboxylate
side chain. it thus appears that the precise pka values of the
two enzymes are achieved by an interplay of the effects of
different amino acids (see below). the analogous d222e
mutation in aatase results in a 0.25 unit decrease in the
aldimine pka (9), where it is likely that the glu side chain is
too large to be accommodated easily in the position occupied
by asp in the wt enzyme.
in summary, it is demonstrated that ile232 is a dominant
factor in establishing the high aldimine pka of acc synthase
over that existing in aatase, which has ala224 in this
position. the mechanism for the isoleucine-induced pka
elevation is likely an increase in the length of the tyr233plp hydrogen bond over that present in aatase. mutation
of ile232 to alanine therefore results in a decrease in the

eliot and kirsch
aldimine pka of acc synthase. introduction of isoleucine
at the analogous position in aatase weakens the hydrogen
bond and raises the pka of that enzyme. the effect of ile232
is in part countered by the longer distance between the
pyridine nitrogen of the cofactor and asp230 in acc
synthase compared to that present in aatase.
