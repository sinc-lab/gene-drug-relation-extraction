elucidation of the biochemical activity and specificity of enzymes
is an essential step toward understanding their physiological roles.
despite the progress in genomics, structural proteomics, and
computational biology, functional annotation of enzymes is often
limited to the family level; i.e., the precise substrate specificity for
a given enzyme remains largely undefined. these challenges are
exemplified by the large and diverse family of s- xxxd3156xxx 
( xxxd3156xxx  or sam)-dependent methyltransferases (mtases); more
than 150 different members have been cataloged by the enzyme
commission, and the numbers are still rapidly increasing. these
enzymes conduct their activities on a host of substrates, including
small molecules, dna, rna, and proteins.1 of the five known
mtase structural folds, only the class iv spout family of rna
mtases and the class v set-domain containing family of protein
lysine mtases exhibit generally definable targets.1a,b the other
classes (i-iii) do not correlate to the chemical nature of the
substrates which themselves are distinguished by chemical diversity
and include amines and guanidines (n), alcohols and carboxylic
acids (o), thiols and sulfides (s), alkenes, and even alkanes (c).1
as such, the structures of many putative mtases have been
determined, but their substrates and functions remain elusive.2
progress in functional analyses of mtases is hampered by the
inert properties and small size of the methyl group, making it
difficult to directly tag or selectively bind methylation products.
the past decade has witnessed the development of chemical
approaches for the selective labeling of biomolecules that undergo
enzyme-catalyzed group transfer, including phosphorylation, acylation, and glycosylation.3 these approaches typically involve
enzymatic introduction of traceable tags using permissive substrate
analogues and subsequent recognition of labeled products with bioorthogonal chemistry.3 for instance,  xxxd3156xxx  analogues substituted
with activated alkyl groups in place of the methyl group served as
alkyl donors for nucleic acid mtases, and the unnatural groups
were transferred in a sequence-specific manner.4 when functionalized with an aliphatic amine, the tagged products were visualized
by amine reactive fluorescent reporter groups. in a different
approach,  xxxd273xxx  containing adenosyl analogues were used as
surrogates of  xxxd3156xxx . to mark the resulting bisubstrate adducts,
the purine is substituted with either a fluorescent group or an azide
group for subsequent modification by staudinger ligation.5
herein, we report the synthesis and activity of an  xxxd3156xxx 
analogue functionalized with a ketone group (keto- xxxd3156xxx , scheme
1), which serves as an attractive probe due to the absence of ketone
groups in nucleic acids and proteins and its orthogonal reactivity
with hydroxylamines and hydrazides.6 the ketone group reacts with
these agents rapidly and quantitatively in aqueous solutions, and
the resulting oximes and hydrazones are stable; thus, these versatile
chemistries are widely used for biological labeling studies.6

scheme 1. enzyme-catalyzed transmethylation from  xxxd3156xxx ,

transfer of ketone group from keto- xxxd3156xxx , and the detection of
ketone containing products via selective derivatization

keto- xxxd3156xxx  was synthesized in a single step from s- xxxd3157xxx  ( xxxd3157xxx ) and bromoacetone in a manner analogous
to the preparation of other  xxxd3156xxx  analogues.4 the activity and
specificity of keto- xxxd3156xxx  were first assessed in vitro using class
i mtases  xxxg487xxx  (comt,  xxxg487xxx ) from
porcine liver and human  xxxg2319xxx  ( xxxg2319xxx ,
 xxxg2319xxx ). our results show the ketone group is transferred from
keto- xxxd3156xxx  to the nucleophilic substrates for both mtases in a
time and enzyme concentration dependent manner (see supporting
information (si) 3 and 4.1). detailed studies were carried out with
 xxxg2319xxx , an enzyme which exhibits substrate promiscuity in the
methylation of a broad spectrum of aromatic thiols, including
 xxxd2573xxx  drugs.7 despite its role in drug metabolism, the endogenous substrates of  xxxg2319xxx , if any, remain unknown. as summarized
in table 1, the substrate specificity of  xxxd3156xxx  and keto- xxxd3156xxx 
mirror each other. for example, three known substrates (aromatic
thiols a-c) are alkylated by keto- xxxd3156xxx . conversely, the nonsubstrate ( xxxd2821xxx , d) is not alkylated by either  xxxd3156xxx  or
keto- xxxd3156xxx .

subsequent kinetic analysis using 4-nitrobenzenethiol (a) as the
alkyl accepting substrate indicates that keto- xxxd3156xxx  is a respectable
substrate of  xxxg2319xxx  (table 1); the calculated kcat/km value (120 m-1
s-1) is approximately 300-fold lower than the value measured with
 xxxd3156xxx . competition assays conducted at varied ratios of  xxxd3156xxx 
to keto- xxxd3156xxx  indicate these substrates bind to the same site on
 xxxg2319xxx  (see si 4.3).

benzylthiols were not previously considered as substrates of  xxxg2319xxx ,
this aliphatic thiol was intended as a negative control. this
serendipitous finding highlights the utility of keto- xxxd3156xxx  to
identify undescribed mtase activities.
a general concern regarding substrate analogues, in particular
those with intrinsically reactive aziridines or sulfoniums, is whether
the analogue modifies and inactivates enzymes.4,5 using mass
spectrometry, no modification was detected for either  xxxg2319xxx  or
 xxxd3157xxx  nucleosidase, even in the presence of excess keto- xxxd3156xxx .
more importantly, the activities of these enzymes were not affected.
an additional advantage of keto- xxxd3156xxx  as a labeling reagent is
that multiple turnovers were observed with various substrates (e.g.,
at least 14 for 4-nitrobenzenethiol). we further report that the
analogue is stable for over 2 months when stored under mildly
acidic conditions and at either -20 or -80 °c.
in summary, keto- xxxd3156xxx , a readily accessible analogue of
 xxxd3156xxx , expands the toolbox available to interrogate the biochemical functions of mtases. when coupled with specific mtases, the
analogue may further serve as a site-specific labeling reagent for
bioconjugation and structural diversification.4,5

keto- xxxd3156xxx  followed by derivatization with alexa fluor 647 hydroxylamine.

labeling of the substrate using the analogue was demonstrated
ex vivo with human erythrocyte lysate which contains  xxxg2319xxx .8
hplc analysis of the reaction containing  xxxd3156xxx  and 4-nitrobenzenethiol indicates the methyl sulfide product is obscured by the
broad peaks eluting between 44 and 54 min resulting from heme
and other metabolites (figure 1, top), even though a fairly large
amount of the product (1.1 nmol) was loaded onto the column.
this observation further underscores the challenges inherent in the
identification of unknown products; under standard analytical
conditions, reaction products may not be detectable against the
background of cellular components. in comparison, the  xxxg2319xxx 
product was readily detected using keto- xxxd3156xxx  as an alkyl donor
and derivatization with alexa fluor 647 hydroxylamine (figure 1,
bottom). at 650 nm, the complex background associated with the
erythrocyte lysate, including the strong absorptions from heme, is
absent. other than the excess hydroxylamine dye, the oxime product
is the single prominent peak visible at this wavelength and due to
the large extinction coefficient at 650 nm (203 000 m-1 cm-1), 52
pmol of the ketone product (1/20th of the methylation reaction)
were sufficient to provide a strong signal.9
one of the goals is to identify unknown substrates of mtases.
toward this end, we attempted to identify endogenous substrates
of  xxxg2319xxx . labeled products were not observed from red blood cell
lysate treated with keto- xxxd3156xxx  (see si 5.1). since active  xxxg2319xxx 
was present, endogenous thiol substrates might already be converted
into their methylated forms. another possibility is that no endogenous substrates exist. it has been reported that human subjects
with little  xxxg2319xxx  activity due to genetic background display no
observable phenotype except when undergoing  xxxd2573xxx 
treatment.7e unexpectedly, we found that an aliphatic thiol (4methoxybenzylthiol) was labeled by keto- xxxd3156xxx . subsequently,
 xxxg2319xxx -catalyzed methylation by  xxxd3156xxx  was confirmed. since
