abstract
alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (agt) is a liver peroxisomal enzyme, deﬁciency of which results in  xxxg102xxx 
( xxxg102xxx ). more than 65  xxxg102xxx -related mutations are now documented in the agt gene ( xxxg102xxx ), of which about 50% are missense. we have
generated a spectrum of 15 missense changes including the most common  xxxg102xxx  mutation, g170r, and expressed them on the appropriate
background of the major or minor allele, in an escherichia coli overexpression system and in a rabbit reticulocyte transcription/translation system. we have investigated their eﬀects on enzyme activity, dimerization, aggregation, and turnover. the eﬀect of pyridoxal
phosphate (plp) on dimerization and stability was also investigated. although all 15 mutant agts were expressed as intact proteins
in e. coli, only three: g41r and g41v on the major allele, and the common mutation g170r, resulted in signiﬁcant amounts of enzymatic activity. dimerization failure was a frequent observation (13/15) except for g41v and d183n. dimerization was poor with s187f
but was substantially improved with plp. proteasome-mediated protein degradation was observed for all the mutations except g41r on
the major allele, g41v, d183n, g170r, and s218l. increases in the stability of the mutant enzymes in the presence of plp were small;
however, g41r on the minor allele showed a direct relationship between its half life and the concentration of plp. the minor allele agt
product and many of the mutants were subject to a limited non-proteasomal proteolytic cleavage when atp was depleted.

introduction
missense changes comprise up to 50% of disease-causing
mutations in inborn errors of metabolism [1]. missense rarely inactivates an enzyme directly but more frequently leads
to mis-folding which in turn may cause reduced aﬃnity for
ligands, increased susceptibility to quality control-mediated
degradation, or aggregation [2–4]. it is well documented that
eukaryotic cells employ an eﬃcient proteasome-mediated

protein quality control system that ensures that only correctly folded proteins are allowed to proceed to maturity [5,6].
mis-folded proteins are either degraded through this process
or undergo aggregation. although the quality control system has been extensively studied for proteins that traverse
the er [7,8], it is not limited to that organelle. examples
have been reported in mitochondrial, peroxisomal and cytoplasmic proteins [9–12].
we have examined the impact of missense mutations on
a liver peroxisomal enzyme, human alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase type 1 (ec 2.6.1.44) or agt. agt is responsible for converting glyoxylate to glycine (reviewed [13]). in
 xxxg102xxx  ( xxxg102xxx ), a genetic deﬁciency of

agt, glyoxylate is converted instead to oxalate, which
accumulates as insoluble calcium oxalate salts in the kidney
and causes progressive renal disease.
two common normal haplotypes of the agt gene
( xxxg102xxx ), the major and minor alleles ( xxxg102xxx -ma and
 xxxg102xxx -mi) occur in the caucasian populations with frequencies of 80% and 20%, respectively [14].  xxxg102xxx -mi
diﬀers from  xxxg102xxx -ma by two coding sequence polymorphisms, p11l and i340m, and a non-coding duplication
in intron 1 [14–16]. p11l introduces a cryptic mitochondrial
targeting signal.  xxxg102xxx -mi has no apparent clinical signiﬁcance unless it also carries an additional mutation such as
the most common  xxxg102xxx  mutation 508g > a (g170r). in
that combination, g170r acts synergistically with p11l
to inhibit dimerization thereby promoting mis-targeting of
the monomeric protein to the mitochondria by virtue of
the cryptic targeting signal [17]. interestingly, the g170r
mutation confers substantial residual enzymatic activity
[14,18]. p11l appears to have a role in potentiating the
eﬀects of other missense mutations as well, probably
through destabilization of dimers. the recent publication
of the crystal structure of agt [19] has permitted a rationalization of the eﬀects of some missense mutations.
the application of small molecules to facilitate proper
folding of mutant proteins and hence enhanced stability
and possibly a level of functional recovery is an active area
of research in many genetic disorders including  xxxg102xxx  [20–
22]. plp, the active intracellular form of pyridoxine ( xxxd3049xxx ), is a logical candidate to consider for such studies
with agt because of its role as an essential co-factor for
agt and the known therapeutic role of  xxxd3049xxx  for
patients with mutations conferring partial activity, particularly g170r [13,23]. in earlier studies with two of the most
common missense mutations, plp enhanced the solubility
of agt/i244t, but had little eﬀect on agt/g170r
[24,25]. among other plp-dependent enzymes, the co-factor has been suggested to stabilize the holoenzyme [26,27].
more than 65 mutations have now been documented in
 xxxg102xxx  [reviewed: 28; more recent additions: [29–32]].
approximately 50% are missense. we have used bacterial
and rabbit reticulocyte expression systems to examine the
consequences of missense in terms of enzymatic activity,
dimerization or aggregation, and biological stability of
agt. we have extended these studies to examine the inﬂuence plp on the fate of mutant agt. fifteen mutations
were selected for study on the basis of the location of the
aﬀected amino acid in areas important in catalysis, in the
dimer interface or in areas of conserved sequence and high
mutation density.

canada (burlington, ont., canada), the pet30a expression plasmid was
obtained from novagen (madison, wi, usa).
promega tnt t7 quick coupled transcription/translation system
was purchased from fisher scientiﬁc ltd (nepean, ont., canada). stabilized translation grade 35s-methionine (>1000 ci/mmol) was obtained
from perkin elmer canada ltd (woodbridge, ont., canada). coomassie
blue (serva blue g250) was purchased from helix technologies (scarborough, ont., canada). hexokinase, protease inhibitor cocktail,
mg132 proteasome inhibitor and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (bs3)
cross-linker were all obtained from sigma–aldrich canada (oakville,
ont., canada).

agt expression plasmids
normal and mutant human agt constructs were generated ﬁrst in
pet30a as previously described [32,33]. these constructs incorporate
the human agt amino acid sequence (agt-ma and agt-mi) with
an n-terminal leader of 44 amino acids including his6- and s-tags.
the expressed polypeptide would have a size of 48.6 kda. mutations
were produced in these plasmids using a quick-change site-directed
mutagenesis method (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa) as described earlier. table 1 lists the oligonucleotide primers used in site-directed mutagenesis. unless stated otherwise, mutations were produced on the
 xxxg102xxx -ma or  xxxg102xxx -mi background on which they originally occurred
in  xxxg102xxx .
a pcdna3.1(+) vector was modiﬁed to generate agt-coding plasmids for transcription/translation without the additional 44 amino acid
tag used in the pet30a constructs but including an optimal kozak
sequence [34]. the mutated agt cdna sequences from pet30a/ xxxg102xxx 
were ampliﬁed with high ﬁdelity pfu polymerase using the oligonucleotide
primers, pet2r (5 0 -gctagttattgctcagcgg-3 0 ) and agt47f
(5 0 -gatctgggtaccgacgacgacgacgccgccatggcc-3 0 )
and inserted as cassettes into the pcdna3.1 vector at kpn1/bamhi sites.
the size of the polypeptide was expected to be 43 kda.
table 2 summarizes the  xxxg102xxx  mutations analyzed, their locations within the agt protein structure, and their potential eﬀects on the structure.
g170r (mi) is the only mutation of the group shown to be mis-targeted to
mitochondria [41].

protein gel electrophoresis
blue native gels: non-denaturing linear gradient blue native gel electrophoresis (bn-page), was performed as described [45] with some modiﬁcations. to achieve better resolution of agt monomers, dimers and
aggregates, 5–16% linear gradient gels were used with 0.05% coomassie
blue g-250 added to the cathode buﬀer during the run. electrophoresis
was performed at 50 v until the samples were within the stacking gel
and continued at 150 v until the coomassie blue reached the end of the
gel. gels were ﬁxed, dried and visualized by phosphorimaging on a biorad personal imager.
sds–page: protein electrophoresis under denaturing conditions was
performed using standard conditions described by laemmli [46].

agt enzyme assay
agt was assayed using an abbott alcyon 300 chemistry analyzer as
previously described [47]. units are expressed as lmoles pyruvate produced/h/mg protein.

overexpression in escherichia coli and extraction of agt
methods
materials
pfu polymerase was purchased from fermentas life sciences (burlington, ont., canada). the plasmid, pcdna3.1, and custom mutagenic oligonucleotides were obtained from canadian life technologies, invitrogen

mutant pet30a/ xxxg102xxx  constructs were grown in e. coli bl21(de3)plyss, induced with iptg (isopropylthiogalactoside) and harvested, separating soluble and insoluble fractions, as previously described [47]. agt
was recovered from insoluble inclusion bodies by extraction with guanidine hcl, renaturation and reconstitution with plp as described earlier
[47].

in vitro transcription/translation

results

cell-free transcription/translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysates
and the pcdna3.1/ xxxg102xxx  constructs was performed following the
supplier’s protocols. products were labeled during a 90 min incubation at 30 c with 35s-methionine (0.4 lm methionine, 35s-methionine
at 400 lci/ml). a chase study was initiated by adding unlabelled
methionine to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 mm and cycloheximide
(40 lg/ml) followed by incubation at 30 c for the times indicated
in the text. where atp depletion was required, this was accomplished by treatment with hexokinase (40 units/ml) and 20 mm glucose. mg132 was used to inhibit proteasome activity [48,49].
sigma protease inhibitor cocktail was used to inhibit other protease
activity.

expression of normal and mutant human agt in e. coli

chemical cross-linking
bs3 was used for cross-linking as previously described [50]. the
product of transcription/translation (0.5 ll) was diluted into 20 ll of
0.1 m kpi buﬀer ph 7.4 containing 2 mm bs3 and was incubated at
room temperature for 30 min. the reaction was stopped by addition
of 1 ll of 1 m tris–hcl (ph 7.4). samples were analyzed by sds–
page.

over-expression of the  xxxg102xxx  constructs in e. coli produced a protein product visible as a 48. xxxg2061xxx  band
on sds–page. for the normal agt-ma, this product
represented 22–25% of the total cellular protein. enzymatic
activity was determined for the soluble fractions and is
compared in table 3 for a spectrum of missense mutants.
for comparison, activities are given for liver biopsy samples reported for the mutations where such information
was available from patients who were either homozygous
for the mutation or compound heterozygous with a second
mutation not expected to produce functional protein. all
the constructs produced full-sized products in the e. coli
overexpression system, yielding 11–14% of the protein in
the soluble fraction in each case. most of the mutant constructs yielded very low activity with respect to total protein with the following exceptions: g170r on both

agt-ma and agt-mi backgrounds, and the g41 series,
where agt-ma-g41v and agt-ma-g41r yielded significant activity while agt-mi-g41r exhibited low activity.
these results were consistent with previous reports of partial activities for these mutations [47,52].
extraction of agt from the insoluble fraction with guanidine-hcl, followed by renaturation and reconstitution
with plp [47] produced enzymatic activity comparable
with that seen in the soluble fraction (table 3) except for
the g41 series, where, as previously reported [47], the procedure generated a product with substantially improved
agt activity.
dimerization and aggregation of normal and mutant agt
dimerization and aggregation were examined using two
independent methods. in the ﬁrst, bn-page was used to
demonstrate the inherent tendency of normal and mutant
proteins to form dimers and/or aggregates. this method
allowed clear resolution of monomers, dimers, and aggregates. the sharpness of the bands makes quantitation possible. the pulse-chase approach with cell-free
transcription/translation was used to determine a time
course for dimerization for the normal agt-ma and
agt-mi. results shown in fig. 1a indicated that agtma is already about 55% dimerized at the start of the chase

353

and had progressed to 90% by 23 h. small amounts of
aggregated material were visible late in the chase. by contrast, agt-mi showed approximately equal amounts of
dimer and monomer at the start of the chase but both
forms gradually declined with a concomitant appearance
of aggregated forms, suggesting that agt-mi is more
prone to aggregation than agt-ma. using puriﬁed
agt-ma and agt-mi and chemical cross-linking, lumb
and danpure [17] had previously demonstrated that both
forms were capable of essentially complete dimerization,
at least at 30 c.
a series of mutants was examined immediately after
the 90 min labeling phase. these results (fig. 1b) indicated that most of the mutants showed little dimerization
at that time. bands of slowly migrating aggregated material were visible near the top of the gel. as expected,
agt-mi-g170r showed only a trace of dimerization,
consistent with earlier results that had linked the poor
dimerization of this mutant with mistargeting [50]. both
agt-ma-d183n and agt-ma-g41v were clearly able
to dimerize and very little aggregate was visible. the other
mutants tested showed little or no dimer formation and
varying degrees of aggregation. the eﬀects of plp on
dimerization and aggregation could not be studied with
the bn-page method because of plp interference in
the gel system.

a second method of assessing dimerization and aggregation employed bifunctional cross-linking of transcription/
translation products with bs3. this method was not
100% eﬃcient in achieving cross-linking of dimers and
therefore was not appropriate for quantitative measurements of dimerization. nonetheless, it did provide a preliminary screen for dimerization and aggregation and
permitted the inclusion of plp in the samples. pulse/chase
analyses were performed with a chase time up to 6 h. parallel measurements were done with and without plp present from the start of the transcription/translation for the
normal agt-ma and agt-mi products as well as for
the mutants. results for selected mutants are shown in
fig. 2. for agt-ma and agt-mi, (fig. 2a and b), dimerized products persisted for at least 6 h consistent with the
results of the bnp analysis. addition of plp apparently
resulted in a higher yield of product overall. this increase
ranged from 1.2x, and 1.3x for agt-ma-s187f and
agt-ma, respectively, to 2.5x for agt-mi-g170r. in
the case of agt-mi-g170r (fig. 2c), without plp, dimer
was detectable at the start of the chase then disappeared.
with plp present, the dimer persisted throughout the
chase. aggregates were present in both cases. agt-mi-

g41r (fig. 2d) showed a low level of unstable dimer both
with and without plp. aggregates were present in the ﬁrst
30 min of the chase but disappeared over the 6 h chase.
both agt-ma-g41v and agt-ma-g41r (data not
shown) formed a low level of aggregates and multiple
cross-linked species that appeared at the size range expected for dimers. plp had no obvious eﬀect. a construct of
agt-ma-d183n showed persistence of dimerization
throughout the chase period with no additional enhancement by plp (fig. 2e). agt-ma-s187f showed little
dimerization without plp but when plp was added, significant dimerization was detected (fig. 2f). constructs of
agt-ma with the mutations, a112d, g156r, g161r,
c173y and s218l all showed no signiﬁcant dimerization
(data not shown) when assayed by cross-linking, with or
without plp.
sensitivity to proteasomal degradation
the turnover of normal and mutant agt products was
investigated by coupled transcription/translation in vitro
and a pulse-chase approach in parallel with measurements
of dimerization. samples were analyzed without cross-link-

fig. 2. analysis of dimerization and aggregation using cross-linking and sds–page. cell-free transcription/translation and pulse-chase were used to
determine the time course of dimerization and aggregation for a spectrum of mutant agts. products were cross-linked with bs3. a parallel analysis was
performed with 200 lm plp included from the beginning of the labeling period.

ing by sds gel electrophoresis in order to visualize total
agt. an initial study was done with agt-ma-s205p
since this mutation had previously been shown to be sensitive to atp-dependent proteasomal degradation [53]. the
pattern of degradation of agt-ma-s205p in our system
was typical of proteasomal proteolysis, i.e., complete with
no detectable intermediate-sized products. degradation of
agt-ma-s205p was prevented by atp depletion or by
addition of the proteasome inhibitor, mg132 [48,49], but
not by inclusion of a protease inhibitor cocktail (data not
shown). thus the presence of a functional proteasome degradation system in the commercial reticulocyte lysate system was conﬁrmed. the time courses for degradation at
30 c for normal agts and selected mutant forms are
shown in fig. 3a. no intermediate-sized products of degradation were seen. half-lives of the labeled products from

355

fig. 3a are summarized in table 4 along with those for
the other mutants included in the study. normal agtma and agt-mi products showed no decline throughout
a 23 h chase performed in parallel with the dimerization
time course shown in fig. 1a. for the purposes of this
report, stability was deﬁned as persistence of the protein
product with no detectable decline over 23 h. several of
the mutants, agt-ma-g41v, agt-ma-g41r, agtma-d183n, and agt-ma-s218l, persisted throughout
the chase. agt-mi-g170r, by contrast, was slightly less
stable with a t12 of 20.6 h. it was stabilized by addition of
200 lm plp. agt-ma-s205p, with a t12 of 1.8 h, was the
least stable of the mutants studied. for the mutant agtmi/g41r we demonstrated a dose-dependence for stabilization by plp (fig. 3b). the t12 increased linearly with
concentration of plp, from 3.0 h at 0 plp to 11 h at

small positive eﬀect.
atp depletion and limited proteolysis of normal and mutant
agt
the eﬀect of atp depletion on protein degradation was
investigated for the whole series of normal and mutant
agts to conﬁrm that the observed degradation was due
to proteasomal degradation as had been demonstrated
for the s205p mutant. the complete degradation typical
of proteasome activity was prevented in all cases under
atp depletion. there was no proteolysis seen for agtma, or proteins with s205p, g161r, or a112d mutations
whereas in the presence of atp the 3 mutant forms had
reduced half-lives relative to agt-ma. however, a limited
proteolysis to 41.2 kda was seen for agt-mi, and proteins with w108r(mi), d183n, s218l, g156r,

g170r(mi), c173y, s187f, g41v, g41r(ma), or
g41r(mi) mutations. this represents a loss of 1.8 kda
in size. the results for agt-ma-g41r, agt-ma-g41v
and agt-mi-g41r are shown in fig. 4. the 41.2 kda
product was evident as early as 30 min into the chase and
was subsequently stable. a more extensive analysis of the
g41 set showed that the partial proteolysis was not aﬀected
by plp. inclusion of the proteasome inhibitor, mg132, in
the absence of atp, prevented the appearance of the new
band (data not shown).
discussion
we have used two in vitro expression systems to investigate the fates of a spectrum of missense mutant agts and
the potential role of plp in ameliorating the consequences
of the mutations.
the availability of the crystal structure of agt [19,39]
permits some rationalization of the eﬀects of individual
missense mutations. the spectrum of mutations (table 2)
selected for this study includes sites associated with the catalytic site, the plp attachment site, the dimer interface,
and a conserved region ﬂanking  xxxg170xxx  that is the site of
numerous missense mutations among the latter group,
g156r, g161r, d183n and s187f are clustered in the
area of the catalytic pocket.  xxxd183xxx  contacts the co-factor
plp and is considered part of the catalytic pocket [19].
g170r in conjunction with the minor allele has a well-documented role in hindering dimerization and promoting
mis-targeting to the mitochondria [41,54]. amino acids
201–221 ﬁt a consensus sequence spanning the plp attachment site found in type v aminotransferases (prosite #
pdoc005140) with  xxxd2227xxx  as the attachment site. s205p
and s218l occur in this region and represent deviations
from the consensus sequence.
with the exceptions of g170r and the g41 series, the
mutant agts studied in this communication showed
<5% agt speciﬁc activity compared to the relevant
agt-ma or agt-mi normal protein when expressed in
e. coli and analyzed in the soluble fraction. these proteins
did not appear to be targets for degradation in the bacterial
cells. combining the data on lack of enzymatic activity

glucose and hexokinase.

with the failure of dimerization seen in transcription/translation products as assayed by cross-linking and bn-page
studies suggests that most of these mutant proteins are
inherently unable to dimerize although aggregation may
occur. in the case of g170r, a slight enhancement of
dimerization or stabilization of existing dimers was
observed when plp was added. aggregation occurred with
most of the constructs including the normal agt-ma and
agt-mi but it was especially evident where dimerization
was poor. in most cases, over the course of the pulse-chase,
even the aggregates decreased in abundance, likely victims
of proteasomal degradation or insolubility.
in most cases, missense mutant agts were subject to
proteasome-mediated degradation. generally, plp exerted
only slight eﬀects on the stability of the mutant proteins.
there were exceptions to these general patterns of loss
of activity, failure of dimerization, aggregation and sensitivity to proteasomal degradation. agt-ma-s218l failed
to dimerize and had low catalytic activity but was stable
to proteasomal degradation. agt-ma-s187f demonstrated little detectable dimerization in the absence of plp, but
addition of plp resulted in substantial dimer production.
there was, however, only a small enhancement of stability
with plp for this mutant. moreover, reconstitution with
plp after renaturation from guanidine-hcl failed to
restore signiﬁcant enzymatic activity. in these two cases,
dimerization was not essential to biological stability nor
did it confer it.
agt-ma-d183n was unusual in having low speciﬁc
activity in the e. coli extract, but being biologically stable,
and able to dimerize. in this case, missense appears to
directly impact catalytic activity. in the original patient
with d183n, enzymatic activity was absent but agt-speciﬁc crm was not reported [37]. these results are similar
to those seen with g82e [17,27]. both  xxxg82xxx  and  xxxd183xxx  are
thought to contact plp in the active site of agt [19].
the g82e mutation has been shown to prevent plp binding [17], a consequence that can be rationalized by the crystal structure of agt [19,39]. an analysis of the d183n
mutation with swiss protein deep view software suggests
that the substitution of n for d prevents normal hydrogen
bonding with plp in the catalytic site. there is minimal
change in the size of the side chain. the consequence of
the d183n mutation may be a direct eﬀect on plp binding
with little eﬀect on agt folding.
obviously, organelle targeting cannot be addressed with
the present in vitro system. most of the mutations occur on
a major allele background so we anticipate peroxisomal
location if the protein survives long enough to get there.
g41r-mi has been shown in vivo to form peroxisomal
aggregates [43]. there is no in vivo data available for
w108r-mi. it fails to dimerize and might be a candidate
for mis-targeting but it is also sensitive to proteasomal degradation so demonstrating its location may be problematic.
the g41 series of mutations is of special interest because
g41 is the closest contact between the subunits in the dimer
interface [19,39] and is thought to be critical in the forma-

357

tion of a solvent cavity connecting the catalytic pockets of
the subunits. previous data showed that in vivo the g41r
mutation on the minor allele had reduced agt activity
and was associated with peroxisomal aggregates visible
by em [43]. we have previously shown that mutations in
the g41 series displayed greatly increased km(plp) values
in the order g41r-mi > g41r-ma > g41v > normal and
that signiﬁcant enzymatic activity could be restored to
these mutants by renaturation from guanidine-hcl and
reconstitution with plp [47]. our present data extend these
observations to dimerization and stability.
agt-ma-g41v showed >50% dimerization (fig. 1b)
whereas agt-ma-g41r showed a lower proportion of
dimerization. the cross-linking studies showed traces of
dimerized products for agt-mi-g41r. both valine and
arginine substitutions would be predicted to occupy more
space than the normal glycine in the solvent cavity between
subunits. the impact of the arginine substitution may be
greater than that of valine because of the charged sidechain. the non-polar valine substitution also presents a
large side chain but may be more compatible with the local
non-polar sequence. the added dimer instability imparted
by the p11l substitution of agt-mi would be expected
to further weaken the dimerization capability of agtmi-g41r relative to agt-ma-g41r. a similar argument
can be made to rationalize the diﬀerence in sensitivity to
proteasomal degradation of agt-mi-g41r compared to
agt-ma-g41r and agt-ma-g41v.
many of the mutant proteins and the agt-mi underwent a limited proteolysis when the proteasome was inactivated by atp depletion. this proteolysis was inhibited by
mg132 consistent with the reported blocking of other proteases by this compound [48]. there was no obvious relationship between mutations that were subject to the
partial proteolysis and sensitivity to proteasomal degradation, capacity for dimerization, or ma vs. mi background.
interestingly, agt-mi itself was subject to partial proteolysis but agt-ma was not. this would suggest that the
most likely site of the cutting is in the n-terminal extension
of agt. the size of peptide fragment lost is 1.8 kda or
about 18 amino acids. the limited nature of the proteolysis
suggests a speciﬁc cut site. in the presence of atp, the site
is presumably protected, perhaps by association with a
chaperone, during critical folding events.
in summary, failure of dimerization, aggregation and
proteasome-mediated instability are the most frequent consequences of missense mutations in agt. indeed, in the
group studied here, direct loss of catalytic activity appears
limited to g82e and d183n. we have previously demonstrated increased km(plp)s for the g41 series [47]. in a
few cases, instability and dimerization failure could be partially ameliorated by inclusion of the co-factor, plp.
it is unclear whether the concentrations of plp used
in vitro are in a range achievable by therapeutic supplementation of  xxxd3049xxx . the concentration of  xxxd3049xxx  in
whole blood with normal dietary intake is expected to be
about 1.6–2.0 lm with about 0.1 lm plp in plasma [55].

m.b. coulter-mackie, q. lian / molecular genetics and metabolism 89 (2006) 349–359

therapeutic doses of b6 range from 200 to 1000 mg day,
i.e., about 100–500· normal daily intake resulting in a proportional increase in plasma plp [56]. however, there may
not be a similar relationship between b6 intake and intracellular concentration of plp. the latter is tightly regulated and high doses of b6 may achieve limited intracellular
increases [55,57].
in vitro studies such as these reported here allow us to
develop strategies to examine the various consequences of
missense mutations under controlled conditions. the
results provide a starting point for possible future testing
of potential pharmacological agents and in vivo expression
studies of mutant agt in tissue culture where more complexities such as organelle targeting can be investigated.
