nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids) such as
aspirin have been shown to suppress transcription factor
nf-jb, which controls the expression of genes such as
cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 and  xxxg366xxx , leading to
inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells. there is no
systematic study as to how these drugs differ in their ability
to suppress nf-jb activation and nf-jb-regulated gene
expression or cell proliferation. in the present study, we
investigated the effect of almost a dozen different commonly
used nsaids on  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-induced nfjb activation and nf-jb-regulated gene products, and on
cell proliferation. dexamethasone, an anti-inﬂammatory
steroid, was included for comparison with nsaids. as
indicated by dna binding, none of the drugs alone
activated nf-jb. all compounds inhibited tnf-induced
nf-jb activation, but with highly variable efﬁcacy. the
50% inhibitory concentration required was 5.67, 3.49, 3.03,
1.25, 0.94, 0.60, 0.38, 0.084, 0.043, 0.027, 0.024, and
0.010 mm for aspirin, ibuprofen,  xxxd3259xxx , phenylbutazone,
naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, resveratrol, curcumin,
dexamethasone, celecoxib, and tamoxifen, respectively. all
drugs inhibited ijba kinase and suppressed ijba degradation and nf-jb-regulated reporter gene expression. they
also suppressed nf-jb-regulated cox-2 and  xxxg366xxx 
protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. all
compounds inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells, with
50% inhibitory concentrations of 6.09, 1.12, 0.65, 0.49,
1.01, 0.19, 0.36, 0.012, 0.016, 0.047, 0.013, and 0.008 mm
for aspirin, ibuprofen,  xxxd3259xxx , phenylbutazone, naproxen,
indomethacin, diclofenac, resveratrol, curcumin, dexamethasone, celecoxib, and tamoxifen, respectively. overall
these results indicate that aspirin and ibuprofen are least
potent, while resveratrol, curcumin, celecoxib, and tamoxifen are the most potent anti-inﬂammatory and antiproliferative agents of those we studied.

introduction
owing to its analgesic and anti-inﬂammatory effects,
aspirin ( xxxd234xxx ), ﬁrst synthesized in 1897,
was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
in 1899 (botting, 1999). since then several other
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids) have
been synthesized and approved for human use. the antiinﬂammatory and analgesic effects of nsaids have
been shown to be due to their ability to inhibit the
enzymatic activity of cyclooxygenases (coxs), which
convert  xxxd208xxx  to prostaglandins (pgs) (vane,
1971). aspirin is one of the most widely used drugs, with
an average yearly consumption of 30 g/person in the
industrialized countries (roth and calverley, 1994) and
a daily consumption in the united states alone of
35 000 kg (jack, 1997).
in most cases, aspirin or another nsaid either
prevents or delays the onset of the disease. extensive
research has shown that aspirin has a potential in the
treatment of a wide variety of inﬂammatory diseases
including cancer, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, and
alzheimer’s disease (o’neill, 1998). for instance,
aspirin has been found effective against colon cancer,
especially familial  xxxg170xxx , a hereditary precancerous disease caused by the loss of the
tumor suppressor gene  xxxg170xxx 
(giercksky, 2001). both preventive and therapeutic
affects of aspirin have been reported against colorectal
adenomas (baron et al., 2003; sandler et al., 2003).
moysich et al. (2002) found that regular aspirin use may
be associated with reduced risk of lung cancer. when the
analyses were restricted to former and current smokers,
participants with the lowest cigarette exposure tended to
beneﬁt most from the potential chemopreventive effect
of aspirin.
how aspirin and other nsaid mediate their effects is
not fully understood. whether inhibition of cox-1
(constitutive) or cox-2 (inducible) activity is a major
mechanism of its action has been questioned. for
instance, goel et al. (2003) showed that growth
inhibition of human colon cancer cells by aspirin is
through cox-independent mechanisms and is due to
the change in expression of dna mismatch repair
proteins (goel et al., 2003). similarly, williams et al.

downregulation of nf-jb, cox-2,  xxxg366xxx , and proliferation by nsaid
y takada et al

9248

(2000) showed that the cytotoxic effects of celecoxib,
another nsaid, were independent of cox-2 inhibition
because similar effects were observed in cox-2 ( þ / þ ),
cox-2 ( þ /) and cox-2 (/) ﬁbroblasts.
generally, a strong correlation has been found
between inﬂammation and cancer (coussens and werb,
2002), suggesting that cancer is an inﬂammatory disease.
celecoxib, however, has been shown to reduce pulmonary inﬂammation but not lung tumorigenesis in mice
(kisley et al., 2002). thus, novel targets to explain the
effects of nsaid are being sought. nuclear factor nfkb is one such target that has been shown to mediate
inﬂammation and suppress apoptosis, and it is commonly overexpressed in cancer cells (bharti and
aggarwal, 2002). the expression of most genes that
are involved in inﬂammation (e.g. cox-2) or in cellular
proliferation (e.g.  xxxg366xxx ) are regulated by  xxxg1559xxx .
thus, both antiproliferative and anti-inﬂammatory
effects of nsaid can be explained through their ability
to suppress  xxxg1559xxx . although aspirin was the ﬁrst
nsaid shown to suppress  xxxg1559xxx  (kopp and ghosh,
1994), now several nsaid have been shown to suppress
 xxxg1559xxx  activation (kazmi et al., 1995; scheuren et al.,
1998; yamamoto et al., 1999; chuang et al., 2002;
bryant et al., 2003).
how various nsaid differ in their ability to suppress
 xxxg1559xxx  activation,  xxxg1559xxx -regulated gene expression,
and proliferation has not been examined and is the focus
of the current study. we examined 11 different nsaid
for inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-induced
 xxxg1559xxx  activation,  xxxg1561xxx  degradation,  xxxg1559xxx  reporter
gene expression, expression of  xxxg366xxx  and cox-2,
and antiproliferative effects.

results
in the present study, we investigated the relative antiinﬂammatory and antiproliferative effects of most
commonly used nsaids by examining their effects on
tnf-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation,  xxxg1561xxx  kinase,  xxxg1561xxx 
degradation,  xxxg1559xxx -regulated reporter gene expression,
 xxxg1559xxx  regulating proteins, and proliferation of tumor
cells. we examined the effect of the oldest (aspirin) and
the most recently identiﬁed (celecoxib) nsaids. in all,
11 different nsaids, along with dexamethasone, were
investigated. the similarities and dissimilarities in the
chemical structure of these nsaids are shown in
figure 1.
nsaids inhibit tnf-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation
activation of  xxxg1559xxx  is one of the earliest events that
mediate inﬂammation induced by various stimuli in
most cells (bharti and aggarwal, 2002). whether all
nsaids inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  activation induced by tnf, a
most potent inﬂammatory stimulus, was investigated.
cells were pretreated with various concentrations of
nsaid either for 4 or 8 h (phenylbutazone, resveratrol
and diclofenac), and then activated for  xxxg1559xxx  by
treatment with 0.1 nm tnf for 30 min. nuclear extracts
oncogene

were prepared and analysed for  xxxg1559xxx  activation by
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa). as shown
in figure 2, none of the nsaids by themselves
activated  xxxg1559xxx . tnf-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation,
however, was inhibited by all nsaid in a dosedependent manner. the 50% inhibitory concentration
required was 5.67, 3.49, 3.03, 1.25, 0.94, 0.60, 0.38,
0.084, 0.043, 0.027, 0.024, and 0.01 mm for aspirin,
ibuprofen,  xxxd3259xxx , phenylbutazone, naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, resveratrol, curcumin, dexamethasone, celecoxib, and tamoxifen, respectively (table 1).
based on ic50, aspirin was least potent and tamoxifen
was most potent (567-fold). the ic50 of celecoxib was
comparable with dexamethasone (236- vs 210-fold).
since  xxxg1559xxx  is a family of proteins, various
combinations of rel/ xxxg1559xxx  protein can constitute an
active  xxxg1559xxx  heterodimer that binds to a speciﬁc
sequence in dna (ghosh and karin, 2002). to show
that the retarded band visualized by emsa in tnftreated cells was indeed  xxxg1559xxx , we incubated nuclear
extracts from tnf-activated cells with antibodies to
either the p50 ( xxxg1559xxx ) or the p65 (rela) subunit of
 xxxg1559xxx . both shifted the band to a higher molecular
mass (figure 2b), thus suggesting that the tnfactivated complex consisted of p50 and p65 subunits.
preimmune serum (pis) had no effect on  xxxg1559xxx 
complex. excess unlabeled  xxxg1559xxx  oligonucleotide
(100-fold) caused complete disappearance of the band
and no effect by using mutant  xxxg1559xxx  oligonucleotide.
to further determine the speciﬁcity of the effect of
nsaids on  xxxg1559xxx , we examined its effect on the
transcription factor oct-1. for this, cells were treated
with the indicated concentrations of aspirin or curcumin
for 4 h, the nuclear extracts were prepared, and the
extracts examined for binding to labeled oligonucleotides containing speciﬁc binding sites for oct-1 by

emsa. oct-1 bound to their speciﬁc dna sequence,
and the treatment of cells with neither aspirin (figure 2c)
nor curcumin (figure 2d) affected the activity of oct-1.
these results indicate that the effects of nsaids on
 xxxg1559xxx  activation are speciﬁc.
nsaids inhibit tnf-dependent  xxxg1561xxx  degradation and
ikb kinase activity
the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  is known to require the
phosphorylation, ubquitination, and degradation of
 xxxg1561xxx , the natural inhibitor of  xxxg1559xxx  (ghosh
and karin, 2002). to determine whether inhibition of
tnf-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation was due to the inhibition of  xxxg1561xxx  degradation, we pretreated cells with
various concentrations of nsaids for either 4 or
8 h (phenylbutazone, resveratrol, and diclofenac), and
then exposed them to 0.1 nm tnf for 30 min. the
cell extracts were then examined for  xxxg1561xxx  status in
the cytoplasm by western blot analysis. tnf induced
 xxxg1561xxx  degradation, but in nsaid-pretreated cells, tnf

failed to induce the degradation of  xxxg1561xxx  (figure 3a).
the effect was dose-dependent. based on ic50, like nfkb activation, aspirin again was least potent and
tamoxifen was most potent in suppressing  xxxg1561xxx 
degradation.
since  xxxg1561xxx  degradation requires  xxxg1561xxx  kinase (ikk)
activation, we also examined the effect of various
nsaids on tnf-induced ikk activity. cells were
treated with nsaids as described above and then
treated with 1 nm tnf for 5 min. whole-cell extracts
were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti- xxxg463xxx 
antibody, and then subjected to ikk kinase assay. the
results indicate that tnf activated ikk and all
nsaids inhibited tnf-induced ikk kinase activity
(figure 3b).

does not always correlate with  xxxg1559xxx -dependent
gene transcription, suggesting that there are additional
regulatory steps (nasuhara et al., 1999). to
determine the effect of nsaids on tnf-induced

 xxxg1559xxx -dependent reporter gene expression, we transiently transfected a293 cells with the  xxxg1559xxx -regulated

construct, incubated them with nsaids, and then

(c) and curcumin (d) had no effect on oct-1 in kbm-5 cells. cells were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of aspirin or
curcumin for 4 h, and then treated with 0.1 nm tnf for 30 min. nuclear extracts were prepared and analysed for oct-1 activation by
emsa. result shown are representative of two or three separate experiments

increase in seap activity over the vector control
was
observed
upon
stimulation
with
1 nm
tnf (figure 4). nsaids repressed  xxxg1559xxx -dependent
reporter gene expression induced by tnf in a dosedependent manner. in most cases, the dose required to
suppress  xxxg1559xxx -dependent reporter activity was similar
to that needed for inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  dna-binding
activity. thus, these results suggest that nsaids
also suppressed tnf-induced  xxxg1559xxx -dependent gene
expression.

nsaids inhibit tnf-induced and  xxxg1559xxx -regulated
protein expression
through activation of  xxxg1559xxx , tnf induces  xxxg366xxx 
and cox-2, both of which have  xxxg1559xxx -binding sites in
their promoters (yamamoto et al., 1995; guttridge et al.,
1999; hinz et al., 1999). the suppression of cox-2 is
essential for the anti-inﬂammatory effects of nsaids,
whereas the suppression of  xxxg366xxx  explains
their antiproliferative effects. to determine whether
nsaids inhibit tnf-induced  xxxg366xxx  and cox-2, we

figure 4 effect of nsaids on tnf-induced gene expression. a293 cells were plated in 12-well plates and transiently transfected with
 xxxg1559xxx -seap plasmid along with b-actin-renilla plasmid (transfection control) by the fugene 6 as described in materials and
methods. then cells were pretreated with various concentrations of nsaids either for 4 or 8 h (phenylbutazone, resveratrol, and
diclofenac) and exposed to 1 nm tnf. the cell culture medium was harvested after 24 h and analysed for seap activity as described in
materials and methods. the cells were also lysed and analysed for luciferase activity as described in materials and methods. the results
are expressed as fold with basal  xxxg1559xxx  activity in the untreated samples as one. the activity was normalized against the b-actin-renilla
for transfection control. the results shown are the average7s.d. of two separate experiments. the signiﬁcance of results when
compared with the tnf-treated cells are *p>0.1, **po0.1, ***po0.01, ****po0.001

pretreated the cells with nsaids, and then exposed
them to tnf. tnf induced  xxxg366xxx  expressions, and
nsaids blocked tnf-induced expression of this gene
product in a dose-dependent manner (figure 5). similarly, tnf also induced the expression of cox-2
protein, and nsaids blocked tnf-induced gene
expression in a dose-dependent manner (figure 6).
these results further support the conclusion that
nsaids block  xxxg1559xxx  activation and  xxxg1559xxx -dependent
inﬂammatory gene expression.
nsaids inhibit tnf-induced  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2)
synthesis
pge2 is formed through cox-mediated conversion of
 xxxd208xxx  (lawrence et al., 2002). whether
suppression of cox-2 expression by nsaids correlates
with suppression of pge2 synthesis was examined. to
determine this, we pretreated mouse macrophage with
the indicated concentrations of aspirin or curcumin for
4 h, and then cells were stimulated with 1 nm tnf for
12 h, collected the culture media, and analysed for pge2
secretion. figure 6b shows that tnf induced pge2
secretion and aspirin suppressed it in a dose-dependent
manner (left panel). similar results were observed with
curcumin (right panel). these results thus suggest that
nsaids inhibit both cox-2 protein expression as well
as its enzymatic activity.

nsaids inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells
as nsaids inhibited the expression of  xxxg366xxx ,
which is a cell cycle regulator, we also examined the
effect of nsaids on the proliferation of human lung
adenocarcinoma h1299 cells and on human myeloid
kbm-5cells. kbm-5 cells were incubated for 72 h in the
presence of different concentrations of nsaids,
and then cell viability was assayed. all nsaids
decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner
(figure 7a). the 50% inhibitory concentration required
in kbm-5 cells was 6.09, 1.12, 0.65, 0.49, 1.01, 0.19,
0.36, 0.012, 0.016, 0.047, 0.013, and 0.008 mm
for aspirin, ibuprofen,  xxxd3259xxx , phenylbutazone, naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, resveratrol, curcumin, dexamethasone, celecoxib, and tamoxifen,
respectively (table 1). based on the ic50, aspirin was
least potent and tamoxifen was the most potent
(761-fold) antiproliferative agent. h1299 cells were also
incubated for the indicated days in the presence of
different concentrations of nsaids, and then cell
viability was assayed by the 3-(4, 5-dihydro-6-(4-(3, 4dimethoxy benzoyl)-1-piperazinyl)-2(1h)-quinolinone
(mtt) uptake method. all nsaids also decreased
h1299 cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent
manner (figure 7b).
to determine whether the effect of nsaids on cell
viability is due to a decrease in cell proliferation or to an
increase in apoptosis, we performed [3h]thymidine
incorporation assay and parp-cleavage assay as an
indication of caspase activity. kbm-5 cells were treated
with the indicated concentrations of aspirin or curcumin
for 18 h, labeled them with [3h]thymidine for further 6 h,
and analysed [3h]thymidine uptake (figure 7c). we
found that both curcumin and aspirin inhibited thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner.
whether nsaids induce apoptosis was also examined. for this, kbm-5 cells were incubated with the
indicated concentrations of aspirin or curcumin for 24 h,
prepared whole-cell extract, and performed western
blot analysis using anti-parp antibody (figure 7d).
these results indicated that nsaids induced parp
cleavage in a dose-dependent manner, thus suggesting
an induction of apoptosis. thus, nsaids can both
inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis.

relative efﬁcacy of classical nsaids and those which
are cox-2 speciﬁc (such as celebrex) in suppressing nfkb activation and  xxxg1559xxx -regulated protein expression,
and cell proliferation. our results clearly demonstrate
that all the commonly used nsaids can suppress tnfinduced dna binding of  xxxg1559xxx  by inhibiting ikk
activation and  xxxg1561xxx  degradation. they also inhibited
 xxxg1559xxx -dependent reporter gene expression and nf-kbregulated protein expression. both cox-2, which
regulates inﬂammation, and  xxxg366xxx , which regulates
proliferation, were downregulated by all nsaids. all

the nsaids inhibited cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner as well.
that both tnf and  xxxg1559xxx  play a major role in
inﬂammation is well established (bharti and aggarwal,
2002; aggarwal, 2003). our results indicate that all
nsaids can block tnf-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation, in
agreement with reports that aspirin (hass et al., 1992;
kopp and ghosh, 1994; yamamoto et al., 1999),
dexamethasone (hass et al., 1992; kopp and ghosh,

figure 7 effect of nsaids on cell viability, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. (a) in all, 5000 cells of kbm-5 were treated with various
concentrations of nsaids for 72 h. then, cell viability was determined by mtt incorporation as described in materials and methods.
(b) a total of 5000 h1299 cells were treated with various concentrations of nsaids for the indicated days. then, cell viability was
determined by mtt incorporation. (c) effect of nsaids on [3h]thymidine incorporation. in total, 10 000 kbm-5 cells were treated
with various concentrations of aspirin or curcumin for 18 h, and then labeled them with [3h]thymidine for further 6 h, and analysed
[3h]thymidine uptake as described in materials and methods. the results expressed are percentage of untreated control (100%).
results shown are representative of two independent experiments. the signiﬁcance of results when compared with the each untreated
control are *p>0.1, **po0.1, ***po0.01, ****po0.001. (d) kbm-5 cells were incubated with various concentrations of aspirin or
curcumin for 24 h. whole-cell extracts were prepared, resolved on 7.5% sds–page, and then electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane. western blot analysis was performed using anti-parp and anti-b-actin antibodies as described in materials and methods.
results shown are representative of two independent experiments

bryant et al., 2003). scheuren et al. (1998) showed that
r()-ibuprofen as well as the s( þ )-enantiomer inhibited the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  in response to t-cell
stimulation. one recent report showed that low doses of
celecoxib inhibit il-1-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation and
high doses stimulate it (niederberger et al., 2001),

whereas in our system, celecoxib alone did not activate
 xxxg1559xxx . another recent report showed that aspirin at 5–
10 mm activated  xxxg1559xxx  in colorectal cancer hrt 18
cells but not in other colorectal cell lines (stark et al.,
2001), suggesting a cell type speciﬁcity. callejas et al.
(2002) also showed that salicylate, aspirin, indomethacin,
oncogene

ibuprofen, and 5,5-dimethyl-3(3-ﬂuorophenyl)-4-(4methylsulfonyl)phenyl-2(5h)-furanone, a ﬂuorinated
derivative of rofecoxib, had no effect on ikk activity,
the processing of  xxxg1559xxx , or the expression of nf-kbdependent genes, such as nos-2 in hepatocytes. tegeder
et al. (2001) also showed that indomethacin failed to
inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  activation. our results differ from those
reported in these studies. these differences could be
linked with cell type used, type of  xxxg1559xxx  inducer
employed,  xxxg1559xxx  assay used (dna binding vs reporter)
and its dose, or the dose of nsaid examined.
our results also indicate that various nsaid
suppress  xxxg1559xxx  activation through inhibition of ikk
activity, leading to suppression of  xxxg1561xxx  degradation.
these results are in agreement with reports that aspirin,
 xxxd3259xxx , and  xxxd3219xxx  can inhibit the activity of
ikk (yin et al., 1998; yamamoto et al., 1999).
curcumin and resveratrol have also been shown to
inhibit ikk (singh and aggarwal, 1995; manna et al.,
2000). our ﬁnding that indomethacin can suppress
tnf-induced ikk activity, however, differ from that of
yamamoto et al. (1999), who reported that indomethacin had no effect on ikk. the difference again may be
due to differences in cell type or activator.
our results also indicate that among all the nsaid
used, tamoxifen is the most potent inhibitor of  xxxg1559xxx 
activation. based on ic50, it is 567-fold more potent
than aspirin. there is no prior report on the suppression
of  xxxg1559xxx  activation by tamoxifen. tamoxifen is a
nonsteroidal antiestrogen that is widely used for
chemoprevention. since  xxxg1559xxx  suppression has been
closely linked with chemoprevention (bharti and aggarwal, 2002), it is possible that chemopreventive effects
of tamoxifen are due to  xxxg1559xxx  inhibition as described
here. interestingly, the effects of tamoxifen do not
appear to be mediated through the  xxxg730xxx 
(er), as neither kbm-5 nor a293 cells used here are
known to express er. these results are in agreement
with reports that tamoxifen can induce apoptosis in ernegative human cancer cell lines (namely t-leukemic
jurkat and ovarian a2780 cancer cells) (ferlini et al.,
1999).
we found that celecoxib, a speciﬁc cox-2 inhibitor,
is 236 times more potent than aspirin in inhibiting nfkb activation. this inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  was again
mediated through suppression of ikk and  xxxg1561xxx 
degradation.
we found that all nsaid downregulated nf-kbmediated  xxxg366xxx  and cox-2 protein expression.
aspirin and curcumin also suppressed tnf-induced
pge2 secretion. however, the dose needed to suppress
pge2 secretion was lower than that for cox-2 protein
expression. these results are in agreement with a
previous report (fernandez de arriba et al., 1999;
callejas et al., 2002). these results also point to a more
complex regulation of cox-2 expression besides  xxxg1559xxx 
(inoue et al., 1995; miller et al., 1998).
we found that all the nsaids were quite effective in
suppressing the proliferation of tumor cells. both nfkb and  xxxg1559xxx -regulated cox-2 and cyclind1 have
been associated with cell proliferation. therefore, it is
oncogene

possible that downregulation of  xxxg1559xxx , cox-2, and
 xxxg366xxx  mediate the antiproliferative effects of
nsaid. we found that nsaids (e.g. aspirin and
curcumin) can inhibit both dna synthesis and induce
apoptosis as indicated by caspase-induced parp
cleavage.
there are reports that suggest cox-independent
actions of cox inhibitors (tegeder et al., 2001).
nsaids such as  xxxd3219xxx ,  xxxd3259xxx , and
ibuprofen can induce anti-inﬂammatory and antiproliferative effects independent of cox activity. these
effects were, however, found to be mediated through
inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx .  xxxg366xxx  is required for progression of cells from g1 to s phase of the cell cycle and thus
is critical for cell proliferation. the downregulation of
 xxxg366xxx  by nsaids may explain their antiproliferative effects against various tumor cells. among all the
nsaid, once again tamoxifen was most potent (761fold) in its antiproliferative effects, and this effect must
be er-independent. celecoxib was almost 468 times
more potent than aspirin in suppressing cell proliferation.
when compared with the ic50 of nsaids against
cox-1 and cox-2 (warner et al., 1999), the ic50 of
nsaids for  xxxg1559xxx  inhibition or for antiproliferative
effects suggest that the nsaid effects described here are
cox-independent. for instance, tamoxifen is a
weak inhibitor of cox-1 and cox-2 (see table 1),
yet it is most potent in suppression of  xxxg1559xxx  and
cell proliferation. similarly, celecoxib, which is 100 times
more
potent
than
tamoxifen
in
inhibiting
cox-2 activity (warner et al., 1999), is equally potent
for suppression of  xxxg1559xxx  and cell growth (see table 1).
overall our results suggest that all nsaid can
inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  activation and  xxxg1559xxx -regulated gene
expression, and this may contribute to their
anti-inﬂammatory and antiproliferative effects. since
 xxxg1559xxx  has been implicated in chemoresistance and
radioresistance (jung and dritschilo, 2001; bharti and
aggarwal, 2002),  xxxg1559xxx  inhibitory activity of nsaids
can be exploited to overcome chemoresistance and
radioresistance.

materials and methods
materials
 xxxd3259xxx , indomethacin, aspirin, naproxin, ibuprofen, tamoxifen, dexamethasone, phenylbutazone, diclofenac, mtt and
anti-b-actin antibody were purchased from sigma chemical

98%, and celecoxib were purchased from lkt laboratory (st
paul, mn, usa). resveratrol, with purity greater than 95%,
was purchased from alexis (san diego, ca, usa). all
nsaids were dissolved in 100% dmso at different

dulbecco’s medium, minimum essential medium, rpmi
1640, and fbs were obtained from invitrogen (grand island,
ny, usa). antibodies to  xxxg1561xxx , cox-2, and  xxxg366xxx  were

cell lines and culture
we used the human leukemic cell line kbm-5, which is
phenotypically myeloid with monocytic differentiation, a293,
a human embryonic kidney cell line, and h1299, a human lung
cancer cell line. kbm-5 cells were maintained in iscove’s
modiﬁed dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 15% fbs,
a293 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium
supplemented with 10% fbs, and h1299 cells were maintained in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fbs. culture
media contained 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin.
emsa
 xxxg1559xxx  activation was analysed by emsa as described
previously (takada et al., 2003). in brief, 15 mg of nuclear
extracts prepared from tnf-treated or -untreated cells was
incubated with 32p end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded  xxxg1559xxx 
oligonucleotide from the human immunodeﬁciency virus-1
long terminal repeat (50 -ttgttacaa gggactttcc
gct ggggactttcc agggaggcgtgg-30 ; underlined
sequence is binding site) for 30 min at 371c, and the dna–
protein complex resolved in a 6.6% native polyacrylamide gel.
for supershift assays, nuclear extracts prepared from tnftreated cells were incubated with antibodies against either p50
or p65 of  xxxg1559xxx  for 15 min at 371c before the complex was
analysed by emsa. the speciﬁcity of binding was also
examined by competition with the unlabeled and mutant
oligonucleotide. pis was included as negative controls. the
effect of aspirin and curcumin on the binding of oct-1 to dna
was determined by incubating 15 mg of nuclear extracts with
16 fmol of 32p end labeled with the octamer-binding protein
(oct-1) consensus oligonucleotide 50 -tgtcgaatgcaaatcactagaa-30 (underline indicates oct-1 binding site) for
30 min at 371c, and then analysed using 5% native polyacrylamide gel. the radioactive bands from the dried gels were
visualized and quantitated by phosphorimager (molecular
dynamics, sunnyvale, ca, usa) using imagequant software.

total amounts of  xxxg463xxx  and  xxxg1159xxx  in each sample,
50 mg of the whole-cell protein was resolved on 7.5%
sds–page, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane,
and then blotted with either anti- xxxg463xxx  or anti- xxxg1159xxx 
antibodies.
 xxxg1559xxx -dependent reporter gene transcription assay
the effect of nsaids on tnf-induced  xxxg1559xxx -dependent
reporter gene transcription was analysed by seap assay as
previously described (takada and aggarwal, 2003a). to
examine tnf-induced reporter gene expression, a293 cells
(5  105 cells/well) were plated in 12-well plates and transiently
transfected by the fugene 6 with pnf-kb-seap (0.5 mg)
and b-actin-renilla (12 ng). after 24 h, cells were washed and
then treated with nsaids: aspirin, ibuprofen,  xxxd3259xxx ,
naproxen, indomethacin, curcumin, dexamethasone, celecoxib,
and tamoxifen for 4 h or phenylbutazone, resveratrol, and
diclofenac for 8 h. the medium was then changed, and exposed
them to 1 nm tnf. the cell culture medium was harvested
after 24 h and analysed for seap activity according to the
protocol essentially as described by the manufacturer (clontech, palo alto, ca, usa) using a 96-well plate reader (vecter
3, perkin–elmer life & analytical sciences, boston, ma,
usa) with excitation set at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm.
the cells were also lysed and analysed for renilla activity
according to the protocol (promega, madison, wi, usa)
using a 96-well plate reader (vecter 3).
pge2 secretion
the effect of nsaids on the pge2 secretion was studied. one
million mouse macrophage were seeded into six-well plate,
pretreated with the indicated concentrations of nsaid for 4 h,
then stimulated with 1 nm tnf for 12 h and collected culture
media. the concentration of pge2 was determined using
pge2 elisa kit purchased from r&d systems (minneapolis,
mn, usa).
cytotoxicity assay (mtt assay)

western blot analysis
in all, 30–50 mg of cytoplasmic protein or whole-cell extract
was prepared as described (ashikawa et al., 2002) and resolved
by sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page). then, the
proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane,
blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, and probed with primary
antibodies against either  xxxg1561xxx ,  xxxg366xxx , cox-2, or parp
for 2 h at 41c. the blotting membrane was washed, exposed to
horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for
1 h, and the blots ﬁnally detected by chemiluminescence (ecl,
amersham pharmacia biotech. arlington heights, il, usa).

the cytotoxic effects of nsaids were determined by the mtt
uptake method as described (takada and aggarwal, 2003b).
brieﬂy, 5000 cells were incubated in duplicate in 96-well plates
in the presence of nsaids at 371c. thereafter, mtt solution
was added to each well. after 2 h incubation at 371c,
extraction buffer (20% sds, 50% dimethylformamide) was
added, the cells were incubated overnight at 371c, and then the
optical density was measured at 570 nm using a 96-well
multiscanner (dynex tech.,  xxxg22xxx  revelation; chantilly,
va, usa).
[3h]thymidine incorporation assay

ikk assay
the ikk assay was performed by a method described
previously (takada et al., 2004). brieﬂy, ikk complex from
whole-cell extracts were precipitated with antibody against
 xxxg463xxx , followed by treatment with protein a/g–sepharose
beads (pierce, rockford, il, usa). after a 2 h incubation, the
beads were washed with lysis buffer and then assayed in kinase
assay mixture containing 50 mm hepes (ph 7.4), 20 mm
mgcl2, 2 mm dtt, 20 mci [g-32p]atp, 10 mm unlabeled atp,
and 2 mg of substrate gst- xxxg1561xxx  (aa 1–54). after incubation at
301c for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with
sds sample buffer for 5 min. finally, the protein was resolved
on 10% sds–page, the gel was dried, and the radioactive
bands were visualized by phosphorimager. to determine the

the effect of nsaids on dna synthesis was monitored by
the [3h]thymidine incorporation method (bharti et al.,
2004). in all, 10 000 kbm-5 cells in 100 ml of medium were
cultured in triplicate in 96-well plates in the presence or
absence of the indicated concentrations of nsaid for 18 h.
then, cells were pulse treated with 0.5 mci [3h]thymidine for
6 h, and the uptake of [3h]thymidine was monitored using a
matrix-9600 b-counter (packard instruments, downers
grove, il, usa).
