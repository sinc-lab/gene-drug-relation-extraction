oxidation of histamine h1 antagonist  xxxd2572xxx  is catalyzed by  xxxg588xxx  in human liver microsomes.   xxxd2572xxx  [10-(3-quinuclidinylmethyl) phenothiazine] is a long-acting and selective histamine h1-receptor antagonist that is mainly biotransformed by human liver microsomes to yield hydroxylated and s-oxidized metabolites.  xxxd2572xxx  hydroxylase was inhibited by propranolol and quinidine. lineweaver-burk plots for the hydroxylation and the s-oxidation indicated that the hydroxylation occurred with a low km (0.72 +/- .26 microm) in human liver microsomes. microsomes from genetically engineered human b-lymphoblastoid cells expressing  xxxg588xxx  (cyp2d6) efficiently metabolized  xxxd2572xxx  to the hydroxylated and s-oxidized metabolites. the results indicate that cyp2d6 isozyme is a major form of cyp responsible for the metabolism of  xxxd2572xxx  in human liver microsomes. inhibition of  xxxg590xxx -catalyzed midazolam 1'-hydroxylase by various histamine h1 antagonists, including  xxxd2572xxx , suggested that  xxxd2572xxx  and some other histamine h1 antagonists could also be inhibitors of  xxxg590xxx  in human liver microsomes.
