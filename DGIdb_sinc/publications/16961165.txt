 xxxd2704xxx : a review of its clinical and pharmacological characteristics.   xxxd2704xxx  is a cardioselective lipophilic beta-blocker devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane-stabilizing actions. the pharmacological profile differs from that of conventional cardioselective  xxxg838xxx -blockers in that it displays  xxxd2738xxx - (no) mediated vasodilator activity. the net hemodynamic effect of  xxxd2704xxx  is the result of a balance between the depressant effects of  xxxg838xxx -blockade and an action that tends to maintain cardiac output, presumably connected with its afterload reducing vasodilator effect. recent studies suggest that  xxxd2704xxx  may also restore endothelial dysfunction. long-term follow-up studies indicate that the compound is efficacious and safe both in patients with mild hypertension and those with stable angina. an interesting effect of chronic  xxxd2704xxx  therapy in elderly patients with mild hypertension is the reversal of a depressor effect into a pressor effect on standing. this action indicates that  xxxd2704xxx  has advantages over other antihypertensive drugs and that it may protect elderly hypertensive patients from orthostatic complaints. the observation that  xxxd2704xxx  improves exercise capacity in non-claudicant hypertensives is also of clinical interest.  xxxd2704xxx  resembles serotonin reuptake inhibitors in that it is metabolized by cyp450 2d6 and, therefore, concomitant treatment with serotonin uptake inhibitors may lead to overdosing.  xxxd2704xxx  compared to placebo does not significantly reduce the mortality risk in elderly subjects. the effects of biological age and comorbidities may be responsible for this finding. in conclusion, clinical studies suggest that  xxxd2704xxx  is effective and safe in patients with hypertension, angina pectoris and heart failure. the beneficial effects on endothelial function, autonomic control and exercise capacity are of considerable clinical interest.
