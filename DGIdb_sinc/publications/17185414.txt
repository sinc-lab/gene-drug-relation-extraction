constitutive overexpression and activation of npm-alk fusion
protein [t(2:5)(p23;q35)] is a key oncogenic event that drives the
survival and proliferation of anaplastic large-cell lymphomas
(alcls). we have identified a highly potent and selective smallmolecule alk inhibitor, nvp- xxxd3273xxx , which blocked the growth of
alcl-derived and alk-dependent cell lines with ic50 values between 2 and 10 nm. nvp- xxxd3273xxx  treatment resulted in a rapid and
sustained inhibition of phosphorylation of npm-alk and its downstream effectors and subsequent induction of apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest. in vivo, nvp- xxxd3273xxx  suppressed lymphomagenesis in
two independent models of alk-positive alcl and induced regression of established karpas-299 lymphomas. nvp- xxxd3273xxx  also
induced down-regulation of  xxxg2302xxx  expression, suggesting that
 xxxg2302xxx  may be used as a biomarker of therapeutic npm-alk kinase
activity inhibition.

a

naplastic large-cell lymphomas (alcls) are a subtype of the
high-grade non-hodgkin’s family of lymphomas with distinct
morphology, immunophenotype, and prognosis (1, 2). alcls are
postulated to arise from t cells and, in rare cases, can also exhibit
a b cell phenotype. in addition, there are ⬇40% of cases for which
the cell of origin remains unknown and that are classified as ‘‘null.’’
first described as a histological entity by stein et al. (3, 4) based on
the expression of  xxxg2302xxx  ( xxxg2302xxx ), alcl presents as a systemic disease
afflicting skin, bone, soft tissues, and other organs, with or without
the involvement of lymph nodes. alcl can be subdivided into at
least two subtypes, characterized by the presence or absence of
chromosomal rearrangements between the anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (alk) gene locus and various fusion partners such as
 xxxg1584xxx  (npm) (5). approximately 50–60% of cases of
alcl are associated with the t(2;5;)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation, which generates a hybrid gene consisting of the intracellular domain of the  xxxg144xxx  juxtaposed with
npm. the resulting fusion protein, npm-alk has constitutive
 xxxg2198xxx  activity and has been shown to transform various
hematopoietic cell types in vitro and support tumor formation in
vivo (1, 6). other less frequent alk fusion partners, e.g.,  xxxg2318xxx  and clathrin heavy chain, have also been identified in
alcl as well as in  xxxg2302xxx -negative diffuse large-cell lymphoma (1,
2, 7, 8). despite subtle differences in signaling and some biological
functions, all fusions appear to be transforming to fibroblasts and
hematopoietic cells (9). alk fusion proteins have also been
detected in a rare form of malignancy called inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (10). extensive analysis of the leukemogenic
potential of npm-alk in animal models has further corroborated
the importance of npm-alk and other alk rearrangements in
the development of alk-positive alcl and other diseases (11).
in this work, we developed a cell proliferation assay using
npm-alk-transformed murine pre-b cell line (ba/f3) to identify
a highly potent and selective inhibitor of alk kinase activity,
nvp- xxxd3273xxx .  xxxd3273xxx  blocked proliferation and survival of
ba/f3 npm-alk, su-dhl-1 and karpas-299 cells with 50%

inhibitory concentrations (ic50) between 2 and 5 nm. this inhibition was accompanied by a rapid and sustained reduction in alk
autophosphorylation, inactivation of npm-alk downstream signaling proteins, and the down-regulation of  xxxg2302xxx  expression, a
hallmark of alcl. finally,  xxxd3273xxx  inhibited lymphomagenesis in
vivo in two independent models of alk-positive alcl.
results
 xxxd3273xxx  selectively inhibits proliferation of npm-alk fusion kinasedependent cell lines in vitro. to identify a selective small-

molecule kinase inhibitor of alk, a cellular screen was used to
search for compounds that were selectively cytotoxic to ba/f3
npm-alk, but not to nontransformed parental ba/f3 cells.
this effort led to the identification of  xxxd3273xxx , a 5-chloro-2,4diaminophenylpyrimidine (fig. 1a) from a kinase-directed
small-molecule library assembled from several different medicinal chemistry programs.  xxxd3273xxx  inhibited the proliferation of
ba/f3 npm-alk cells with an ic50 of 3 nm, without affecting
the survival of parental ba/f3 cells at concentrations up to 1 ␮m
[see supporting information (si) fig. 7].
next, we assessed the potency of  xxxd3273xxx  against established
human alcl cell lines expressing npm-alk.  xxxd3273xxx  inhibited proliferation of karpas-299 and su-dhl-1 cell lines with an
ic50 range of 2–5 nm (fig. 1b). growth inhibition of npmalk-dependent cell lines correlated with a dose-dependent
reduction of npm-alk (y664; equivalent to y1604 of fulllength alk) autophosphorylation in both karpas-299 and sudhl-1 cells (fig. 1c and data not shown) as well as ba/f3
npm-alk cells (fig. 1 c and d). a significant reduction of
alk phosphorylation was observed with an ic50 lower than 10
nm after treatment of cells with the inhibitor for 4 h.
to further evaluate the selectivity of  xxxd3273xxx , we tested the
compound against a panel of 35 ba/f3 cells transformed by
various tyrosine kinases constitutively activated by fusion to tel
(12). as shown in si fig. 7, the inhibitory activity of  xxxd3273xxx  is
highly selective for alk-driven cell proliferation, requiring a
100- to 1,000-fold higher concentration to inhibit other tyrosine
kinases included in the panel. ic50 values between 0.5 and 3 ␮m
were observed for the various cell lines tested.
 xxxd3273xxx  is selective for alk over  xxxg1194xxx . alk shares high sequence

h-4-ii-e rat hepatoma cells. h-4-ii-e cells were preincubated for 30 min with
 xxxd3273xxx  at concentrations indicated before stimulation with recombinant
insulin. treatment of ba/f3 npm-alk cells with  xxxd3273xxx  was performed in
parallel. ic50 concentrations for  xxxg1194xxx  and alk signaling inhibition were determined through the quantification of bands by using bio-rad’s quantityone
software package.

like growth factor receptor ( xxxg1145xxx ). to evaluate the potential of
 xxxd3273xxx  to inhibit  xxxg1194xxx  kinase activity and signaling, the activity of
 xxxd3273xxx  was assessed against both recombinant  xxxg1194xxx  enzyme and
full-length  xxxg1194xxx  in a cellular assay. indeed, when  xxxd3273xxx  was
tested against recombinant  xxxg1194xxx  in an in vitro kinase assay an ic50
of ⬇10–20 nm was obtained in various independent experiments.
similar results where obtained for  xxxg1145xxx . to assess the potency of
 xxxd3273xxx  against  xxxg1194xxx  in a cellular assay, h-4-ii-e rat hepatoma
cells were stimulated with purified bovine insulin after preincubation of cells with either dmso or increasing concentrations of
 xxxd3273xxx . as shown in fig. 1d, stimulation of h-4-ii-e cells with
insulin led to a several-fold increase in phosphorylation of  xxxg1194xxx 
(y1146) as well as of both akt (s473) and  xxxg812xxx  (t24), two key
downstream molecules of  xxxg1194xxx  signal transduction. in marked
contrast to the enzymatic data, a concentration of ⬎1 ␮m  xxxd3273xxx 
was required to block insulin-induced phosphorylation of  xxxg1194xxx ,
akt, and  xxxg812xxx , which is ⬇100-fold higher than the concentration
required to inhibit cellular npm-alk activity (fig. 1d). the ic50
for blocking  xxxg1194xxx  phosphorylation was determined to be 1.2 ␮m,
based on protein band intensity. ic50 data for reduction of akt and
 xxxg812xxx  phosphorylation could not be determined because of insufficient curve fitting but were between 1.1 and 3.3 ␮m. this
discrepancy between the cellular and in vitro biochemical assay is
reminiscent of data recently published by garcia-echeverria et al.
(13), demonstrating selectivity of a small-molecule inhibitor of
 xxxg1145xxx , nvp-aew564, over  xxxg1194xxx  in cellular assays, but not in
biochemical assays. to examine whether this phenomenon was
observed for more recombinant kinases in addition to  xxxg1194xxx , we
determined the ic50 of  xxxd3273xxx  against a variety of other kinases
in biochemical assays. as shown in si fig. 7, ic50 values as low as
galkin et al.

3 and 12 nm were found for  xxxg801xxx  and  xxxg2259xxx , respectively, in
biochemical assays. as was observed for  xxxg1194xxx , the cellular potency
of  xxxd3273xxx  against ba/f3 tel- xxxg801xxx  (ic50 ⫽ 554 nm) and ba/f3
tel- xxxg2259xxx  (ic50 ⬎1 ␮m) were much higher than those observed in
biochemical assays.
these results indicate that, at least in cellular systems at its
therapeutic ic50,  xxxd3273xxx  is a potent and selective npm-alk
kinase inhibitor, without exhibiting significant cross-reactivity
against other kinases tested in this study, including the highly
homologous  xxxg1194xxx .
structural basis for the selectivity of  xxxd3273xxx . inhibitors that bind to

the ‘‘dfg-out’’ conformation of kinases, by filling a hydrophobic
cavity adjacent to the atp-binding site, may more readily achieve
higher kinase selectivity than compounds that simply bind to the
atp pocket (14, 15). access to this hydrophobic pocket seems to
be regulated by multiple factors including the identity of the
‘‘gatekeeper’’ amino acid, amino acid sequence upstream of the
activation loop preceding the highly conserved dfg motive, and
the phosphorylation state of the kinase. for example, imatinib
(sti571), a specific inhibitor of abl, c-kit, and pdgfr binds to the
inactive conformation of abl by using the ‘‘dfg-out’’ conformation, thereby giving the piperazinylbenzamide functionality access
to the allosteric pocket (14, 15). to investigate the structural basis
for the high selectivity of  xxxd3273xxx  in cellular assays, a model of
alk in complex with  xxxd3273xxx  was built based on the published
crystal structure of  xxxg1194xxx  in an ‘‘active’’ or ‘‘dfg-in’’ conformation
(16, 17). as shown in fig. 2,  xxxd3273xxx  is expected to bind to the
atp-binding site by using the ubiquitously observed bidentate
hydrogen-bonding pair to the kinase ‘‘hinge’’ region of alk but
should not extend into the hydrophobic binding pockets. this result
is consistent with the fact that  xxxd3273xxx  does not possess any of the
pharmacophoric features characteristic of compounds that bind to
the dfg-out kinase conformation. interestingly, the orthomethoxy
group attached to the 2-aniline substitutent projects into a small
groove located between the side chains of residues l258 and m259.
sequence alignments of kinases available in the ba/f3 panel
revealed that most kinases have bulkier residues at this position (si
fig. 7). molecular modeling revealed that bulkier amino acids at
this position would lead to a steric clash with  xxxd3273xxx , suggesting
that l258 may be one of the major kinase-selectivity determinants
for  xxxd3273xxx .  xxxg1194xxx , like alk, also possesses a leucine at position
258; however, a 100-fold difference in the ic50 between alk and
 xxxg1194xxx  has been observed in cellular assays, suggesting that additional

model of alk in complex with  xxxd3273xxx , developed based on the published
crystal structure of  xxxg1194xxx  in an ‘‘active’’ conformation by using homology
modeling (moe).  xxxd3273xxx  is expected to bind to the atp-binding site by using
a bidentate hydrogen bonding pair to the kinase ‘‘hinge’’ region of alk. the
orthomethoxy group attached to the 2-aniline substitutent is anticipated to
project into a small groove located between the side chains of residues l258
and m259. (b) position l258 is one of the major determinants for alk selectivity of  xxxd3273xxx . substitution of leucine with a bulkier amino acid such as
phenylalanine (f258) induces a conformational change that leads to a steric
clash of the hinge region with  xxxd3273xxx .

analysis of the signaling pathways downstream of npm-alk is
by far not exhaustive, these data demonstrate that  xxxd3273xxx  is not
only a potent inhibitor of npm-alk, but also a physiological
modulator of its crucial downstream signaling intermediates.

dimensional structure, rather than the amino acid sequence may
contribute to the selectivity of  xxxd3273xxx . analysis of cocrystal
structures of alk and  xxxg1194xxx  with  xxxd3273xxx  could resolve this
question.
 xxxd3273xxx  inhibits signaling downstream of npm-alk. stat transcrip-

tion factor signaling has been shown to play an essential role in
transformation and lymphomagenesis mediated by the npmalk fusion. several investigators have independently shown
that stat3 and/or  xxxg2216xxx  are activated by npm-alk (18–20).
using either a cre/lox system or antisense knockdown, chiarle
et al. (20) could show that loss of stat3 in npm-alk transformed t cells isolated from transgenic mice induces apoptosis
and blocks growth in s.c. tumor models. to further corroborate
the involvement of stat3 and/or  xxxg2216xxx  in signaling downstream of npm-alk, we performed western blot analysis on
lysates of npm-alk-positive cells treated with either dmso or
increasing concentrations of  xxxd3273xxx . as demonstrated in fig.
3a,  xxxd3273xxx  inhibited stat3 and  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation in a
dose-dependent manner in both ba/f3 npm-alk and karpas299 cells. similar results were obtained by using su-dhl-1 cells
(data not shown). after 4 h of treatment with  xxxd3273xxx , stat3
and  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation levels decreased significantly at
concentrations as low as 10 nm and were completely inhibited at
concentrations ⬎50 nm. we also performed kinetic experiments
with  xxxd3273xxx  at a concentration of 50 nm to determine the time
required to achieve full inhibition of npm-alk and stat3. a
significant reduction in the phosphorylation of npm-alk and
stat3 (fig. 3b) was seen as early as 15 min after incubation and
was sustained up to 48 h (data not shown). a direct correlation
between time and concentration was seen for inhibition of both
npm-alk and stat3. the impact of npm-alk inhibition on
both ras/raf/mapk and pi3k/akt signaling was investigated
by using p-erk and p-akt as surrogate markers for these
pathways. as shown in fig. 3c, inhibition of npm-alk by
 xxxd3273xxx  led to a dose-dependent reduction in phosphorylation
of both erk and akt in karpas-299 cells. these results reconfirm that npm-alk is an activator of stat, ras/raf/
mapk, and pi3k/akt in both transformed ba/f3 npm-alk
cells and npm-alk-positive alcl cell lines. although the

inhibition of npm-alk on the growth and survival of alcl
cell lines, we performed cell cycle and apoptosis analyses on cells
treated with either  xxxd3273xxx  or dmso. ba/f3, ba/f3 npmalk, su-dhl-1, and karpas-299 cells were treated with various concentrations of  xxxd3273xxx  for 72 h and were assessed for
induction of apoptosis and growth arrest by flow cytometry every
24 h. treatment with  xxxd3273xxx  increased the number of annexin
v-positive ba/f3 npm-alk cells in a dose- and time-dependent
manner, without affecting the survival of the parental ba/f3 cell
line. at 48 h after incubation with  xxxd3273xxx , 85–95% of cells
stained  xxxg166xxx -positive in several independent experiments.
in contrast, no increase in the number of  xxxg166xxx -positive
cells was seen for parental ba/f3 cells grown in the presence of
 xxxg1177xxx  (fig. 4 a and b). similar to our results obtained by using
ba/f3 npm-alk cells, su-dhl-1 cells appeared to be sensitive
to  xxxd3273xxx -mediated apoptosis induction, with 70–80% of cells
staining positive for  xxxg166xxx  after 48 h of treatment (fig. 4
a and b). intriguingly, karpas-299 did not undergo apoptosis to
a similar degree as did su-dhl-1 and ba/f3 npm-alk cells
despite karpas-299 cell growth being inhibited by  xxxd3273xxx  with
an ic50 of 3 nm (fig. 1b). after 72 h of treatment with a 50 nm
concentration of  xxxd3273xxx , only 20–30% of karpas-299 cells
stained positive for  xxxg166xxx  (data not shown).
the lack of apoptosis in ⬇70% of cells suggested a profound
effect of  xxxd3273xxx  on cell cycle progression in karpas-299 cells.
to investigate the impact of  xxxd3273xxx  on cell cycle in more detail,
 xxxd3273xxx -treated karpas-299 cells were stained with  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide (pi) and analyzed for cell cycle distribution. as shown in
fig. 4 c and d,  xxxd3273xxx  induced g1 phase arrest in a timedependent manner. after 72 h of treatment with  xxxd3273xxx  (25
nm), 72% of karpas-299 cells were arrested in g1 phase
compared with 26% of cells in g1 phase in dmso-treated
controls. the number of cells in s phase was reduced from 60%
to 14% (fig. 4 c and d). collectively, these data suggest that
 xxxd3273xxx  inhibits the growth of alcl cells by both inhibiting the
progression of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. these data
also suggest that npm-alk-positive cell lines respond differently to npm-alk inhibition. differences in the behavior of
su-dhl-1 and karpas-299 cells had been described previously
and have been suggested to correlate with acquired secondary
mutations. these differences are also apparent in the different
potential of these cell lines to induce lymphoma in mice.
although karpas-299 cells readily give rise to a lymphoma-like
disease in immunocompromised mice, no engraftment was seen
with su-dhl-1 cells after both s.c. and i.v. implantation of up
to five million cells (data not shown). a more detailed and global
analysis of signaling downstream of npm-alk as well as
investigation of additional cell lines is warranted and may be
useful in predicting clinical outcomes to alk inhibition.
 xxxd3273xxx  inhibits the development of npm-alk-driven lymphomas in
vivo. we validated the potential of  xxxd3273xxx  to inhibit the growth

of alcl in a newly established, clinically relevant lymphoma
model. to develop a model that would allow us to follow systemic
alcl development and would resemble clinical disease progression as closely as possible, we engineered a luciferized
karpas-299 cell line, which could be monitored in vivo with the
highly sensitive xenogen bioluminescence imaging system. sixto 8-week-old scidbeige mice were injected i.v. with one million
karpas-299-luc cells and were monitored for disease progression

signal was detected in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue,
which then spread to the lymph nodes after 2 weeks. lymph node
infiltration was most prominent but not limited to nuchal and
peritoneal lymph nodes. histological analysis of the enlarged
excised lymph nodes revealed strong infiltration of  xxxg144xxx (alk) and  xxxg2302xxx -positive karpas-299 cells (fig. 5a).  xxxd3273xxx 
displayed appreciable bioavailability and half-life in vivo (data
not shown). seven hours after an oral dose of 20 mg/kg of
 xxxd3273xxx  (formulated as a solution in 10% 1-methyl-2pyrrolidinone/90% peg 300) a maximum plasma level (cmax)
of 800–1,000 nm was measured, with a bioavailability (bav)
ranging between 60% and 70% and an elimination half-life
(t1/2) of ⬇12 h. to demonstrate the feasibility of targeting
npm-alk in vivo without causing toxicity,  xxxd3273xxx  was administered at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg once daily by oral gavage to mice
starting 72 h after karpas-299 i.v. injection. after 2 weeks of
treatment, we observed a 100-fold reduction in bioluminescence
signal in the 3- and 10-mg/kg treatment groups. although the
compound was not efficacious at 1 mg/kg, after 4 weeks of
treatment with  xxxd3273xxx  at 3 and 10 mg/kg, there was a significant
(p ⫽ 0.005) delay in lymphoma development and 100- to
1,000-fold reduction in luminescence signal (fig. 5 b–d). the
 xxxd3273xxx - (10 mg/kg) treated group appeared healthy and did not
display any signs of compound- or disease-related toxicity.
to further validate that the observed in vivo effects of alcl
inhibition were not the consequence of unanticipated off-target
effects, we examined the response of ba/f3 npm-alk- and
ba/f3 bcr-abl-induced lymphoid disease to  xxxd3273xxx  (10
mg/kg) treatment. although no difference in light emission was
observed in mice transplanted with ba/f3 bcr-abl cells after
2 weeks of treatment, we found a ⬎99% difference between
vehicle- and  xxxd3273xxx -treated mice allografted with ba/f3 npmalk cells (si fig. 8). ba/f3 npm-alk-induced disease did not
affect spleen weights to the same extent as ba/f3 bcr-abl
disease burden; nevertheless, we observed a significant 80%
reduction of spleen weight with  xxxd3273xxx  treatment (p ⬍ 0.005)
in ba/f3 npm-alk-injected mice. these data demonstrate the
galkin et al.

specificity of  xxxd3273xxx  therapeutic effects, further corroborating
the selectivity of this compound at the therapeutic doses chosen.
 xxxd3273xxx  inhibits npm-alk fusion kinase-mediated signaling and induces regression of established lymphomas in vivo. to determine

whether  xxxd3273xxx  treatment would induce regression of established lymphomas, in a separate experiment dosing was initiated
12 days after injection of karpas-299 cells. before the start of
treatment, disease progression was confirmed by bioluminescence imaging, as evidenced by strong signal in the nasalassociated lymphoid tissue as well as nuchal, inguinal, and
peritoneal lymph nodes (fig. 6a). mice with validated early
stages of lymphoma were assigned to three treatment groups and
one control group. the control group continued to develop signs
of disease progression and had to be killed on day 19 because of
disease burden and signs of premorbidity. in contrast,  xxxd3273xxx (3, 5, and 10 mg/kg p.o. daily) treated mice responded to
treatment in a dose-dependent manner, displayed significant
signs of improvement, and had a 1,000-fold reduction in bioluminescence signal after 2 weeks of dosing (fig. 6a).
as a follow-up study, we examined the immediate molecular
effects of short-term  xxxd3273xxx  treatment on established lymphomas. treatment was delayed until 3.5 weeks after karpas-299 cell
injection, at which point mice had displayed signs of established
disease and had developed palpable lymphomas. the mice were
then treated with either  xxxd3273xxx  (10 mg/kg) or vehicle solution
for 3 days. immunoblotting analysis of protein from extracted
inguinal lymph nodes revealed a reduction in the phosphorylation levels of npm-alk and its downstream target, stat3 (fig.
6b). histological examination confirmed high infiltration of the
lymph node tissue by the anaplastic,  xxxg144xxx -positive karpas-299
cells (data not shown).  xxxg2302xxx  receptor expression appeared to
vary between lymph node sections from vehicle- and tae684treated groups. vehicle-treated groups displayed high levels of
 xxxg2302xxx , as previously observed during model development; however,  xxxg2302xxx  expression was significantly reduced in lymph nodes
from  xxxd3273xxx -treated mice (fig. 6c). we were able to replicate
these results in vitro, where an ⬇80% reduction in the expression
of  xxxg2302xxx  receptor was observed on the cell surface of karpas-299

24 h after the addition of  xxxd3273xxx  to the culture media (si fig.
9). it is currently unknown whether high  xxxg2302xxx  expression on
alcl cells reflects the phenotype of the cell of origin transformed by npm-alk or whether it is directly induced as a
consequence of npm-alk’s kinase activity. watanabe et al.
(21) have recently demonstrated that  xxxg2302xxx  promoter activity is
controlled by junb, expression of which is regulated by the
 xxxg2302xxx - xxxg1369xxx /2 mapk signaling axis. npm-alk expression by
itself can also induce strong activation of the mek/erk signaling pathway independently of c-raf in npm-alk-transformed
ba/f3 cells.  xxxd3273xxx -mediated npm-alk inhibition leads to a
significant reduction of erk phosphorylation in karpas-299
cells (fig. 3c), which may, in turn, affect  xxxg2302xxx  promoter
activation. these data indicate that the down-regulation of  xxxg2302xxx 
expression through the inhibition of npm-alk kinase activity
is a clinically relevant event and correlates with disease regression.  xxxg2302xxx  receptor expression can be easily assayed for in the
clinic and could be used as a pharmacodynamic marker of
therapeutic npm-alk inhibition.
conclusions
npm-alk and related alk fusion proteins possess transforming and lymphomagenic potential, likely to be mediated by
constitutive kinase activity. although npm-alk-positive lymphomas have a rather benign prognosis, ⬇40–45% of patients do
not respond or relapse after standard therapy. in addition,
standard therapy is associated with considerable toxicity, a
problem specifically bothersome in pediatric patients. therefore, a highly effective and targeted therapy would be beneficial
and highly warranted not only for relapsed patients but also as
first-line therapy if well tolerated and efficacious.

fig. 6.  xxxd3273xxx  treatment induced disease regression in established karpas299 lymphomas. (a) treatment with 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg (mpk)  xxxd3273xxx  was
initiated 12 days after karpas-299 inoculation and disease establishment as
evidenced by bioluminescent imaging, obtained before (day 12) and after 2
weeks (day 26) of dosing. (b and c) mice (m1–m6) with established palpable
karpas-299 lymphomas were treated for 3 days with either 10 mg/kg  xxxd3273xxx 
(m4 –m6) or vehicle solution (m1–m3). four hours after the third dose, mice
were killed, and excised lymph nodes were analyzed for in vivo effects of
 xxxd3273xxx  treatment on npm-alk and stat3 phosphorylation by immunoblotting (b) or for  xxxg2302xxx  expression by immunohistochemistry (c).

npm-alk-positive cells show activation of signaling pathways, such as pi3k/akt (22, 23), jak/stat (18–20), and src
kinases (24), which are reminiscent of, but not completely
overlapping with, those activated in bcr-abl-transformed
cells (25). several studies have suggested that signaling molecules within these pathways could serve as therapeutic targets in
the absence of a specific small-molecule inhibitor targeting
npm-alk (20, 24, 26–30). however, given the enormous
redundancy in signal transduction, it has become clear that no
single pathway downstream of an activated kinase is as suitable
a target as the activated oncogene itself. given the homology
between the oncogenic transformation induced by bcr-abl
and npm-alk and the success of abl targeting smallmolecule inhibitors such as imatinib in the clinic, we endeavored
to develop a selective small-molecule inhibitor of alk kinase
activity, which would inhibit the proliferation and survival of
npm-alk-positive cells both in vitro and in vivo. two recent
studies have described small-molecule inhibitors of npm-alk
that are capable of blocking both alk kinase activity and signal
transduction, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach (31,
32). it was shown that these inhibitors blocked the proliferation
of npm-alk-transformed cells in a concentration-dependent
manner and that an alk-specific inhibitor would have the
potential to become a therapeutic agent for the treatment of
alk-positive alcl and other conditions associated with the
expression of activating alk gene rearrangements. however,
neither kinase selectivity nor in vivo data have been published for
these compounds, suggesting that further optimization may be
necessary before these compounds can be used to specifically
target alk in vivo.
in this study, we have identified and characterized  xxxd3273xxx , a
highly potent and specific inhibitor of npm-alk.  xxxd3273xxx 
inhibited the growth of npm-alk-transformed cells with an
ic50 of ⬇3 nm and was highly selective against several other
tyrosine kinases tested. although potent on the highly homologous  xxxg1194xxx  kinase in vitro, we demonstrated that in cellular
assays  xxxd3273xxx  is ⬇100-fold more potent against alk when
compared with  xxxg1194xxx . this finding might be explained by differences in the three-dimensional structure of the truncated engalkin et al.

materials and methods
see si materials and methods for a more detailed description of
assay methods.

npm-alk, bcr-abl, or tel-kinase fusion constructs were
plated in 384-well plates (25,000 cells per well) and incubated
with serial dilutions of  xxxd3273xxx  or dmso for 2–3 days. luciferase expression was used as a measure of cell proliferation/
survival and was evaluated with the bright-glo luciferase assay
system (promega, madison, wi). ic50 values were generated by
using xlfit software.
flow cytometry. ba/f3 npm-alk, karpas-299, and su-dhl-1

cells were treated with dmso or various concentrations of
 xxxd3273xxx  for 24, 48, and 72 h before analysis of cell cycle
distribution and apoptosis by flow cytometry. samples were
analyzed on a becton-dickinson lsrii flow cytometer (bd
biosciences, san jose, ca).
in vivo experiments. for in vivo compound efficacy studies, treat-

ment was initiated 72 h after tail vein injection of 1 ⫻ 106
karpas-299-, ba/f3 npm-alk- or bcr-abl-expressing cells into
female fox chase scidbeige mice. mice (n ⫽ 10 per group) were
administered either  xxxd3273xxx  resuspended in 10% 1-methyl-2pyrrolidinone/90% peg 300 (sigma) solution at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg
once daily for 3 weeks or the vehicle solution at the same dosing
schedule. disease progression and compound efficacy was monitored weekly with bioluminescence imaging. to determine the
efficacy of  xxxd3273xxx  on established disease, dosing was initiated on
day 12, at which time the disease confirmed to be widespread by
bioluminescence imaging. for analysis of downstream molecular
effects in vivo, mice with established lymphomas were administered
vehicle solution or  xxxd3273xxx  (10 mg/kg) for 3 days. at the end of
treatment, mice were killed, and lymph nodes were extracted for
immunoblotting and histological analysis.

homology modeling and docking. the alk model was developed
by using the homology modeling function in the molecular
operating environment (moe 2005.06) program (chemical
computing group, montreal, qc, canada). the  xxxg1194xxx  kinase
[protein database (pdb) id code: 1ir3] was used as the
template for alk homology modeling, because of the 45%
sequence identity between the  xxxg1194xxx  and alk kinase domains.
 xxxd3273xxx  was docked into the alk model by using gold
[version 1.3 (cambridge crystallographic data center, cambridge, u.k.)] with the standard default settings. all atom types
and charges were assigned in gold. one hundred thousand
independent genetic algorithm (ga) runs were performed for
 xxxd3273xxx  flexible ligand docking. the radius of the search in the
docking was set to 10 å.

 xxxg1282xxx  compared with the full-length receptor in a cellular system
or by differences in the activity of the compound at the atp
concentration used in the enzyme assays versus the physiological
cellular atp concentration. it will be interesting to see whether
a similar difference can be found for  xxxg1145xxx , a potential target
for anticancer therapeutics, and future effort will need to be
focused on elucidating the potency of  xxxd3273xxx  against igf1rdependent cell lines and tumor models. it will also be important
to study in more detail the activity of  xxxd3273xxx  against the native
full-length alk receptor. although alk knockout mice have
been reported to show no significant phenotype (1), several lines
of evidence have suggested a role of full-length alk in different
tumor types including glioblastoma (2).  xxxd3273xxx  could be a
valuable tool to study the role of alk in various tumors in vivo,
if the activity observed for npm-alk could be confirmed
against the full-length receptor.
in summary,  xxxd3273xxx  displayed favorable pharmacokinetic
properties in mice, including high bioavailability, decent half-life
and sufficient distribution into tissues. using a murine model of
alcl, we could demonstrate the feasibility of therapeutically
targeting npm-alk in vivo.  xxxd3273xxx  prevented the development of karpas-299-driven lymphoma if dosed early after injection of cells and led to the regression of established lymphoma,
which was associated with inhibition of phosphorylation of
npm-alk and stat3 in infiltrated lymph nodes. collectively,
these data greatly support efforts to pursue the clinical development of small-molecule npm-alk inhibitors as a treatment
strategy for therapy of refractory and relapsed alk-positive
lymphomas.
