abstract
histaminergic neurons are located exclusively in the tuberomammillary nuclei (tm) of the hypothalamus from where they
project to many regions of the brain including the basal ganglia. earlier experiments led to the hypothesis that neuronal histamine
(ha), particularly in relation to the  xxxg1078xxx , has an inhibitory role in learning and reward-related processes. based on this
premise, the objective of the present study was to compare ha with the h1-receptor antagonist d-chlorpheniramine (cpr) in
effects on reinforcement and memory parameters after injection into different subregions of the rat nucleus accumbens (nacc).
in the first experiment, mnemoactive effects of cpr (0.1– 10 mg) were assessed after injection into the caudal or rostral part of
the nacc with the one-trial uphill avoidance task as a measure of learning. the data show that intra-nacc injection of cpr (10
mg) facilitated retention of the task, when the compound was administered immediately after training. this effect was evident only
when cpr was administered into the caudal-shell but not into the rostral pole of the nacc providing evidence for anatomical
specificity of the intra-nacc induced promotion of memory. in the second experiment, possible mnemonic and reinforcing effects
of ha (0.001–1 mg) were gauged after injection of the amine into the caudal nacc, using post-trial application in the uphill
avoidance task to assess effects on learning and place preference as an index of reinforcing properties. the data show that
caudal-nacc injection of ha (0.1 mg) improved retention of the avoidance task and produced place preference indicative of a
reinforcing action. the finding that intra-nacc injection of ha can facilitate learning and has reinforcing effects is at variance
with the proposed inhibitory nature of neuronal ha in reward-related processes. thus, the disinhibition of reinforcement and
facilitation of learning found earlier after partial destruction of tm-intrinsic neurons might not necessarily be related to a
lesion-induced reduction of the haergic tone. the observation that cpr has behavioral effects quite similar to ha suggests that
the mnemoactive and reinforcing action of this compound might involve pharmacodynamic aspects beyond its antagonistic
activity at h1-receptive sites. © 2001 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

the mesolimbic dopamine (da) system is considered
to function as a key element in processes related to
reward, reinforcement and addictive behavior [22,54].
with respect to endogenous factors regulating these
mechanisms, the neuromodulator histamine (ha) may
serve as an interesting candidate since histaminergic

functions can regulate both, reward processes [13] and
accumbens da activity [10,38]. brain ha is exclusively
contained within and released from neurons whose cell
bodies are clustered in the tuberomammillary nuclei
(tm) of the posterior hypothalamus [51]. histamine
pathways arise from tm cell bodies and terminate
along the rostrocaudal axis of the nucleus accumbens
(nacc) with increasing fiber density reaching its peak
accumulation in the caudal ‘shell’ subterritory of the
nucleus [29]. functionally, it has been shown in several
paradigms, including electrical self-stimulation, drug-induced place preference, and operant responding for
food reward that elevated ha activity in the brain can
have an inhibitory effect on reward-related responses
[5,19,45]. thus, reducing the histaminergic tone by a
partial destruction [8,49,50] and transient inactivation
of tm-intrinsic neurons [9] or by blocking ha-transmission at h1-receptive sites [34,35,40] resulted in a
‘disinhibition’ of reinforcement and facilitation of
learning. furthermore, activation of tm-neurons by
electrical/chemical stimulation interfered negatively
with hippocampal signal transfer during learning-related exploratory behavior [53], supporting the view
that the tm-histamine system may function as an
inhibitory neurochemical substrate in the control of
associative processes [13].
a possible link between the tm-histamine and the
mesolimbic da-system in the context of reward-related
processes was provided recently. for one, systemical
administration of histamine h1-receptor antagonists
such as  xxxd3050xxx  or chlorpheniramine led to increased
extracellular da levels in the nacc and neostriatum
[7]. secondly, local application of chlorpheniramine
(cpr) into the nacc induced place preference and
increased the rate of lateral-hypothalamic self-stimulation, providing evidence for behavioral relevance of the
haergic innervation at this brain site. furthermore, the
reinforcing effects of intra-accumbens cpr administration appeared to be brain-site specific since reinforcement was only observed when the antagonist was
injected into the caudal shell, but not into the rostral
pole of the nacc [55].
based on these findings, the objectives of the present
study were as follows: with regard to the parallelism
between reinforcing and memory-promoting effects of
manipulation of the brain [12], we examined whether
intra-accumbal cpr injection can facilitate memory
processing in addition to its rewarding action. referring
to the anatomical specificity observed for the reinforcing effects of cpr in the nacc [55], we also asked
whether the same functional subdivision into caudal
versus rostral pole might be evident for the effects of
the compound on memory. furthermore, we gauged
possible mnemoactive and reinforcing effects of ha
applied locally into the caudal nacc. with respect to
the proposed inhibitory function of ha in reward-re-

lated processes [13], we expected that nacc-injection of
the biogenic amine should produce a behavioral
profile distinct from or even opposite to that obtained
after intra-accumbens administration of the h1-receptor antagonist, that is, ha-injection should be non-rewarding or even interfere negatively with reward and
memory processes. thus, in the experiments outlined
below, the h1-antagonist cpr was injected locally into
the nacc caudal or rostral subregions and compared
with ha in effects on retention of an inhibitory avoidance task and on reward as measured by place preference.

2. materials and methods

2.1. animals
the experiments were carried out in accordance with
the german law on the protection of animals and
were approved by the state authority. male wistar rats
(n=189; tva, university of düsseldorf), weighing
250–300 g at the beginning of the experiments were
housed under standard laboratory conditions with food
and water continuously available. a 12-h light:12-h
dark photocycle was imposed (lights on at 07:00 h) and
behavioral testing was done during the rat’s daylight
period between 10:00 and 04:00 h.

2.2. intra-accumbens microinjection
under anesthesia (ketamine 15 mg, xylazine 1.5 mg
kg − 1; i.p.) animals were implanted unilaterally with a
22g stainless steel guide cannula aimed at the rostral
(ap 2.2, l9 1.5, v 7.0 mm) or caudal nacc (ap 0.7,
l91.0, v 7.0 mm [32]). histamine (ha) and d-chlorpheniramine maleate (cpr) were purchased from
sigma (germany) and diluted in 0.9% saline (ph 5.5)
immediately before injection. four doses of ha (0.001,
0.01, 0.1, 1 mg) and three doses of cpr (0.1, 1, 10 mg)
were used, control animals were administered the
diluent vehicle (0.9% saline). intracerebral injections
were made into hand-restrained rats in a volume of 0.5
ml per animal over a 30-s period with a 28g injection
cannula inserted to a depth of 0.8 mm below the tip of
the guide cannula (50% right-side and 50% left-side
injection).

2.3. histology
at the termination of behavioral testing, the animals
were deeply anesthetized with nembutal (3 ml − 1; i.p.)
for perfusion and subsequent histological survey regarding the injection site. histological verification revealed that the cannula tips were located mainly in or
near the intended subregions of the nacc (fig. 1).

2.4. experimental apparatus
behavioral testing was conducted in sound-protected
experimental chambers with dim overhead lighting (25
w). masking noise (68 db) was provided by a noise
generator. the behavior of the animals throughout the
experiments was recorded by a video system. the experimental apparatus for one-trial uphill avoidance
learning has been described earlier [43]. briefly, it consisted of a gray pvc box tilted at a 20° angle with
35-cm high walls. its 50× 50 cm floor was covered with
wire mesh netting, which allowed an easy foothold for
the animals. electrical shock was delivered through a
bipolar ring electrode attached to the tail of the animal
and connected to a shock generator. place conditioning
was performed with a 2-compartment place-preference
paradigm. the apparatus was an oblong white pvc
box (71×37 ×30 cm), which had a guillotine door
(9.5 ×9.5 cm) separating two compartments of equal
size. different visual and tactile cues were absent within
the apparatus; spatial orientation was provided by distinct cues situated in the observation chamber around
and above the box. during treatment, the guillotine
door was closed and the animal was restricted to one of
the compartments for a 15-min period.

2.5. experiment 1: test for mnemogenic effects of
chlorpheniramine injected into nacc rostral and caudal
subregions
the experiment was performed on three consecutive

205

days. each rat underwent a habituation trial in the
uphill paradigm (day 1), during which it was fitted with
the tail-electrode and then placed into the center of the
inclined box with its nose facing the base. an ‘uphill
response’, that is, the negative geotaxic behavior, consisted of turning around towards the top of the inclined
plane. this turning response was defined as completed
as soon as the position of the animal changed by at
least 90° in either direction as defined by a horizontal
plane formed by the base of the tail and one of the
forepaws. during the learning trial (day 2) the rats
received a tail-shock (1.3 ma for 1 s) contingent upon
the uphill response. after shock administration, the rats
were removed from the box, disengaged from the tail
electrode and were injected with different doses of cpr
or vehicle into the caudal (cpr: 0.1 mg, n= 10; 1 mg,
n= 11; 10 mg, n= 19; veh, n= 20) or rostral pole of
the nacc (cpr: 0.1 mg, n =12; 1 mg, n= 13; 10 mg,
n = 13; veh, n= 13). for intracaudal drug injection
further groups of rats were included, which were administered 10 mg cpr with a 5-h delay (del, n=9) or
without a tail-shock (ns, n= 8). retention of the uphill
response was measured 24 h after shock administration
(day 3). the rat was fitted with the tail-electrode, placed
on the incline with its nose facing the bottom and
allowed up to 180 s to step-up. the wilcoxon rank sum
test was used to compare the step-up latency of each
group registered during the learning and retention trial.
the mann –whitney’s u-test was performed to test for
between group differences in step-up latencies for the

retention trial. furthermore, the fisher’s exact test was
used to analyze categorical data. exact p-values were
used as a measure of effect.

2.6. experiment 2: test for reinforcing and mnemogenic
effects of histamine injected into the caudal nacc
the effects of caudal-accumbens ha injection on the
rat’s performance in the conditioned place preference
and uphill avoidance tasks were assessed in succession:
the place preference procedure was carried out on
three consecutive days. each daily session lasted 15
min. during baseline (day 1), the rats had free access to
both compartments; a rat was considered to be in one
compartment when all four paws were inside. during
the conditioning session (day 2), the guillotine door was
closed. the rats received injections of histamine (ha:
0.001 mg, n=10; 0.01 mg, n = 13; 0.1 mg, n=13; 1 mg,
n=13) or vehicle (veh, n = 12) into the caudal nacc
and were placed into one of the two closed compartments (drug-compartment balanced within each group;
compartment assignment randomly). on the test day
(day 3), the guillotine door was opened, and the rats
again had free access to both compartments. during
baseline and test trials, sojourn times in each compartment were scored and, as a measure of gross locomotor
activity, the number of entries into the compartments
was recorded. to gauge acute effects of intra-accumbens ha on spontaneous behaviors, duration and frequency of locomotion (forward and backward
movements using all limbs), rearing (standing on the
hind legs with the forelegs in the air or against the wall)
and grooming (licking, scratching, biting of the body
surface) were analyzed during the 15-min conditioning
trial. between-group differences in entries into and time
spent in the compartments during the baseline and test
sessions as well as duration and frequency of the behavioral events registered during the conditioning trial were
evaluated with the mann– whitney’s u-test. exact pvalues were used as a measure of effect. possible
mnemogenic effects of the ha-treatment were gauged
with the uphill avoidance protocol as described in
experiment 1. thus, after 5 days of having been tested
in the place preference paradigm, the animals received a
second injection with different doses of histamine or
with vehicle into the caudal nacc. the rats were randomly assigned to the following groups: histamine
(0.001 mg, n= 11; 0.01 mg, n =12; 0.1 mg, n = 12; 1 mg,
n= 10) or vehicle (veh, n = 13) and were injected with
the drug immediately after receiving the tail-shock (2
ma for 1 s) during training of the avoidance task.
retention of the uphill response was measured 24 h
after shock administration. the rat was fitted with the
tail-electrode, placed on the incline with its nose facing
the bottom and allowed up to 180 s to step-up.

fig. 2. effect of intra-acumbens chlorpheniramine injection on retention of the uphill avoidance task. during the training trial, the rats
received a tail-shock contingent on the uphill response. retention is
expressed as median latency to step-up measured 24 h after the
training trial (numbers at the bottom of the histograms indicate 25/75
percentiles). the treatment consisted of post-trial injection of 3
different doses of cpr into the caudal shell (left) or rostral pole of
the nacc (right). controls included vehicle-injected (veh), 5-h delay
(del) and no-shock (ns) groups. *p b0.05, indicative of superior

the statistical analysis of the avoidance parameters
was identical to that described for experiment 1.

3. results

3.1. experiment 1: test for mnemogenic effects of
chlorpheniramine injected into nacc caudal and rostral
subregions
the median step-up latencies for the treatment
groups on the training trial fell within the range of 2.6
(1.8/5.2) to 5.1 (2.8/7.2) s (median925/75 percentile).
comparison between training and retention latencies
indicated that only the groups of animals that were
injected immediately post-trial with 10 mg cpr into the
caudal or 0.1 mg cpr into the rostral nacc had
learned the task (caudal cpr 10 mg, pb 0.001; rostral
cpr 0.1 mg, p= 0.041). the effects of cpr injected
into the different nacc subregions on retention
performance are depicted in fig. 2. post-trial administration of 10 mg cpr into the caudal nacc facilitated
learning of the uphill avoidance task, as reflected by
increased latencies to step-up (pb 0.001); 32% more
animals from this group failed to step-up within 180 s
compared with vehicle-injected controls (p=0.012).
the lower doses of cpr did not influence the avoidance performance (0.1 mg, p= 0.692; 1 mg, p=0.741).

caudal nacc 5 h after training or without a tail-shock,
it no longer facilitated the performance of the task
(cpr 10 mg: del, p= 0.311; ns, p =0.576). administration of cpr into the rostral pole of the nacc did not
affect avoidance retention within the dose range tested
(p\ 0.05).

3.2. experiment 2: test for reinforcing and mnemogenic
effects of histamine injected into the caudal nacc
during the baseline trial in the place preference task,
animals of the different treatment groups spent a comparable amount of time in the drug-paired compartment (0.5535 p50.957). successful place conditioning
is indicated by an increase in the amount of time spent
in the compartment in which the animals were sub-

jected to the treatment. fig. 3 shows the relative
amount of time spent in the drug-paired compartment
during the 15-min test session for rats that had received
injection of different doses of ha or vehicle into the
caudal nacc. rats administered ha at the dose of 0.1
mg spent more time in the drug-compartment compared
with vehicle controls (p=0.041); none of the other
doses of ha influenced the rat’s preference behavior
(0.001 mg, p= 0.299; 0.01 mg, p= 0.164; 1 mg, p=
0.106). gross locomotor activity, expressed as the number of entries into the compartments, was not
influenced by intra-accumbens ha injection (0.4475
p5 0.828). the mean (9s.e.m.) number of entries
into the compartments ranged from 15.592.0 to
20.19 2.8. table 1 presents duration and frequency of
the behavioral events registered during the conditioning
trial. the frequency of grooming was decreased for rats
that had received a caudal nacc injection of 0.001 mg
ha (p =0.030). furthermore, rats injected with 1 mg
ha spent somewhat less time rearing (p= 0.092). rats
treated with ha at doses of 0.01 and 0.1 mg did not
differ in their behavioral pattern from vehicle-treated
rats either in the duration or in the frequency of the
behaviors (corresponding p\ 0.10). in the uphill avoidance task, the median step-up latencies for the treatment groups on the training trial fell within the range
of 3.1 (2.3/6.0) to 5.0 (1.5/7.9) s (median9 25/75 percentile). comparison between training and retention
latencies revealed that only the groups of animals,
which were injected with ha at 0.1 (p= 0.050) or 1 mg
(p=0.047) immediately post-trial had learned the task.
comparison between the retention test latencies of the
different treatment groups indicated that both the ha
0.1 and  xxxd306xxx  mg treatment groups showed better
avoidance as reflected by increased latencies to step-up
(ha 0.1 mg, p= 0.066;  xxxd306xxx  mg, p= 0.034; fig. 4);
about 34% more animals from the ha 0.1 mg group
failed to step-up within 180 s compared with vehicle-injected controls (p= 0.068).

4. discussion
the results of the first experiment show that posttrial injection of cpr into the caudal nacc can promote inhibitory avoidance learning in a dose-dependent
manner, that is, a single injection of 10 mg improved
retention performance during the test session whereas
the two lower doses were less effective. the data
provide further evidence for a functional subdivision of
the nacc on its rostrocaudal axis, demonstrating memory-promoting effects of cpr in the caudal, but not in
the rostral part of the nucleus. similar brain-site specific
effects have recently been described for the reinforcing
effects of intra-nacc cpr injection, with the caudalshell subregion being more sensitive to cpr induced
reward than the rostral entity [55]. the performance
enhancing action of caudal-accumbens cpr administration was no longer evident when injection was performed with a 5-h delay, rather than immediately after
the learning trial. this suggests that enduring proactive
effects of the treatment on performance variables during retrieval of the task may not account for the
enhanced avoidance response. furthermore, the animals in the no-shock group showed inferior performance compared with the respective group receiving
cpr in combination with shock, indicating that the
performance enhancing effects of the compound can
not be attributed solely to nonspecific effects such as
increased arousal and/or attention or aversive side-effects. thus, it is feasible that the h1-receptor antagonist interacted specifically with processes involved in

information storage (consolidation) leading to improved memory function. this finding is in line with
recent experiments, which have shown that reducing
haergic activity by a partial destruction/transient inactivation of tm-intrinsic neurons [8,9,20,49,50] or by
blocking ha-transmission at h1-receptors [34,35] can
result in a disinhibition of reinforcement and facilitation of learning. these studies have led to the view that
neuronal ha may be involved in the inhibitory control
of a central system subserving reward-related processes
[13]. however, this hypothesis requires refinement with
regard to the outcome of the second experiment of the
present study, which showed that injection of the endogenous agonist ha into the caudal nacc is at least
as effective than the h1-receptor antagonistic cpr in
reinforcing place preference and facilitating avoidance
learning. this unexpected finding suggests, for one, that
the mnemonic and reinforcing action of cpr might
involve pharmacological mechanisms other than its
proposed antagonistic effects at h1-receptors [23,37],
and, secondly, that the behavioral changes observed
after manipulations of the tm-histamine system may
not necessarily be related to disturbances in haergic
neurotransmission.

4.1. brain-site specific facilitatory effects of
chlorpheniramine on learning
chlorpheniramine was chosen for functional analyses
since the compound is a potent h1-receptor antagonist
that has earlier been shown to be effective in modulating reward-related processes after systemic [25,26,46], as
well as intracerebral administration [34,35]. however,
most of the ha-related substances, including cpr, are
known to bind also to receptors other than haergic
ones [23,37]. thus, the question, whether the cpr-induced effects on reward and memory might alternatively be due to an action other than its h1-antagonistic
action must be addressed, particularly with regard to
the finding that cpr can produce behavioral effects
that are quite similar to those observed after intraaccumbens ha injection. the most prominent side-effect
of cpr is its anticholinergic action at muscarinergic
receptors [23,52]. however, since learning parameters
are generally affected negatively by inhibition of central
cholinergic transmission [15], it is not very likely that
the positive effects of intra-nacc injection of cpr on
learning parameters are related to the anticholinergic
activity of the drug. furthermore, h1-receptor antagonists such as cpr have also been reported to interact
with central daergic mechanisms. thus, it has been
suggested that the known rewarding effects of peripherally administered h1-receptor antagonists are mediated
via inhibition of da uptake resulting in hyperactivation of d1-receptors in nacc and striatum [46]. this
hypothesis could be of interest in the light of the

r.u. hasenöhrl et al. / beha6ioural brain research 124 (2001) 203–211

differential behavioral effects of cpr observed after
injection into the caudal versus rostral subregion of the
nacc. our data showed that the caudal part of the
nacc is more sensitive to cpr induced memory improvement and reward than the rostral pole. since the
rostral part of the nacc is characterized by low levels
of da-terminal and d1-receptor densities which both
are abundant in the caudal region [2,16], one might
speculate that cpr has produced its more pronounced
effect on memory and reward in the caudal nacc
because of the greater amount of da and the higher
density of d1-receptors there. however, using in vivo
microdialysis in urethane-anesthetized rats we recently
found that local infusion of the h1-receptor antagonist
 xxxd3050xxx  into the caudal nacc led to decreased extracellular levels of da there [10]. this neurochemical
pattern was completely different to that obtained with
peripheral  xxxd3050xxx  and cpr administration, which
was followed by increased extracellular da levels [7].
thus, from the differential results, one can conclude
that the increased da levels after peripheral h1-antagonist administration were not due to direct actions
within the nacc, since such local actions should lead to
decreases rather than increases of da there. secondly,
the data raise the possibility that the reinforcing and
memory-promotive effects of intraaccumbens cpr injection might not involve daergic mechanisms, since
drugs which can reinforce behavior typically promote
accumbens da activity and this daergic action is
considered to be a critical requirement for their reinforcing action [14]. finally, histaminergic h1-receptor
antagonists are known to produce local anesthetic effects [11], which may also have contributed to the
neurochemical and behavioral outcome after intraaccumbens  xxxd3050xxx  and cpr injection. thus, with
respect to the pharmacodynamic profile of cpr, the
mechanism by which the compound was effective to
facilitate learning and to reinforce place preference is
not clear yet. to specifically address this issue, future
studies should examine the effect of other h1-receptor
antagonists with different secondary binding properties
and should compare the behavioral and neurochemical
pattern of local cpr to that of known local anesthetics
and/or to that of h1-receptor antagonists for which
anesthetic actions can be excluded [48].

4.2. reinforcing and memory-promoti6e effects of
accumbal ha injections
the present data with ha administration support
and extend earlier pharmacological findings, which
showed that the biogenic amine can have positive effects on learning and reward-related processes. thus,
kamei et al. [18] reported a direct relationship between
the response latency in an active avoidance task and the
decrease in brain ha levels and i.c.v. injection of the

209

amine was found to facilitate memory in adult [6] and
aged rats [17]. furthermore, i.c.v. administration of
ha, its precursor histidine or the h3-antagonist thioperamide improved, whereas treatment with alphafmh, that inhibits neuronal synthesis of ha, impaired
the performance on an olfactory social memory task;
learning deficits were also evident after central administration of the h3-agonist immepip that inhibits ha
release via stimulation of presynaptically located h3autoreceptors [33]. however, other studies have provided evidence for an inhibitory role of neuronal ha in
learning and reinforcement processes. thus, administration of h1-receptor antagonists such as cpr increased
self-stimulation or decreased stimulation threshold currents, while central injection of ha raised the threshold
for self-stimulation [5,47]. furthermore, microinjection
of ha into the dentate area or subiculum complex
adversely affected active avoidance conditioning via
h1-receptive sites [3], and the h3-receptor agonist (r)alpha-methylhistamine improved water maze navigation performance [39]. the reasons for these discrepant
findings require clarification; however, the main problem with the reliability of the data may lie in the
effectiveness of the haergic drugs tested, rather than,
for example, in the use of different learning tasks,
modes of injection and variation in the time of injection
in relation to the learning trials, etc.
with regard to the close anatomical relationship
between ha and da systems in the brain and between
da and reinforcement processes [21], one can expect
that the behavioral effects of ha in the nacc are
related in part to da-mechanisms. however, biochemical data regarding the influence of ha on da activity
do not yield a consistent pattern of results and are
sparse with respect to the nacc. thus, subramanian
and mulder [44] reported a ha-induced enhancement
of da efflux in the rat brain slice preparation, whereas
others found evidence that ha can inhibit neostriatal
da release or da synthesis via presynaptic h3-receptors [27,36]. however, we recently showed that locally
administered ha can increase da levels in the nacc,
whereby the ha-induced da release could be blocked
by peripheral administration of the h1-antagonist
 xxxd3050xxx , which itself was found to decrease da
levels after local intra-nacc infusion [10]. these results
indicate that the beneficial effects of ha on memory
and reward-related processes might be mediated, in
part, through daergic increases within the nacc. furthermore, the neurochemical effects appeared to be
long-lasting, suggesting that the biogenic amine is able
to modify the ‘functional state’ of nucleus accumbens
cells. in addition, another aspect should be pointed out.
several studies have shown that da-agonists such as
amphetamine or cocaine have motor activating properties, which may contribute, to their place conditioning
effects [41]. however, after local intraaccumbens ha

210

r.u. hasenöhrl et al. / beha6ioural brain research 124 (2001) 203–211

injection, no significant between-group differences were
evident for the different measures of behavioral activity
recorded during the conditioning session. this implies
that the two processes, behavioral stimulation and reinforcement, can be dissociated, and indicates that the
effects of intraaccumbens ha injection on reinforcement cannot be interpreted simply in terms of a change
in locomotor/exploratory activity (but see [4]).
recent experiment have shown that a partial lesion
of the tm-nucleus increased the rate of rewarding
hypothalamic stimulation and facilitated the performance of adult and aged rats on diverse learning tasks,
providing evidence that the tm nucleus might be involved in the inhibitory control of a central system
subserving reward and memory-related functions [13].
congruent with this view, electrophysiological recordings in freely moving rats revealed that electrical and
chemical activation of tm neurons interfered negatively with signal processing in the hippocampus [53]
and within the nucleus accumbens-prefrontal cortex
circuitry [38]. since the tm neurons are the only source
of neuronal ha [1,30] and neurotoxic tm-lesions led
to marked decreases in ha-staining neurons [8], as well
as to a general reduction in brain ha content [28], we
hypothesized that the lesion-induced diminution in central ha-ergic tone possibly mediated the disinhibitory
effects on the brain’s reinforcement system [13]. in line
with this suggestion are results from pharmacological
studies demonstrating that the h1-receptor antagonistic
cpr, but not the h2-receptor antagonist ranitidine,
exerted reinforcing and memory promoting effects
when administered into parts of the brain known to be
crucial for reward and memory, namely, the nucleus
basalis [34,35] and the accumbens. however, the
present data which demonstrate promotion of learning
and reward-related functions after intraaccumbens ha
injection do not support implicitly this view and suggest
that the behavioral effects observed after destruction of
the tm might involve neurochemical mechanisms other
than a lesion-induced downregulation of haergic activity. possible mechanisms that might account for the
behavioral effects could involve tm-lesion produced
alterations in diverse neurochemical systems that are
colocalized and functionally linked to ha such as
gaba, glutamate, adenosine and certain neuropeptides
[1,24,42]. thus, it remains to be determined, which
endogenous processes are related to the inhibitory control of tm neurons, thereby affecting processes of
learning and memory. this can only be achieved
through knowledge of the distinct and opposite modulatory actions that the tm-histamine system might
exert by activating different receptor subtypes on different neuronal systems involved in reinforcement and
learning processes [31].
taken together, the present findings do not rule out
that the role of the tm-system in reinforcement may be

of an inhibitory nature, but strongly suggest that the
behavioral changes after tm manipulation are not
necessarily be related to disturbances in haergic
neurotransmission.
