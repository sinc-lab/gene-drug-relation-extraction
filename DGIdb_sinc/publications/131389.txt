[influence of roentgen rays on electrolyte changes and metabolism of the myocardium. vii. radiation-induced inhibition of the sodium- and potassium...  the behavior of a mg2+-dependent microsomal atpase, which may be activated by na+ and k+, was investigated in the myocardium of guinea pigs after local irradiation. the part which can be activated by na+ and k+ (transport-atpase) is already slightly inhibited thirty minutes after a dose of 250 r; the inhibition rate with 1500 r amounts to about 60%, the maximal inhibition effect with a dose of 3000 r was about 70%. four hours after a local irradiation with 1500 r, a restitution of the inhibition effect occurs with overshoot reaction; 15 and 24 hours following irradiation, a significant inhibition of the transport-atpase activity can again be verified. the k-strophanthidine and  xxxd1884xxx  are inhibiting within the concentration ranges analyzed (2 x 10(-5), 2.5 x 10(-7), 5 x 10(-7) m) the activity of the transport-atpase. the above-mentioned radiation-induced inhibition effect upon the atpase activated by na+ and k+ is additively increased by adding k-strophanthidine (2 x 10(-5) m) and  xxxd1884xxx  (2.5 x 10(-7) m).
