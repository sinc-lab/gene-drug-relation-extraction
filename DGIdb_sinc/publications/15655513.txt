1 this manuscript presents the preclinical profile of  xxxd2517xxx , a novel  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2)
selective inhibitor.
2  xxxd2517xxx  inhibited purified cox-1 and cox-2 with ki values of 3 and 0.06 mm, respectively. in
cellular assays,  xxxd2517xxx  had an ic50 of 0.14 mm in cox-2-expressing dermal fibroblasts, but
caused no inhibition of cox-1 at concentrations up to 30 mm (hek 293 cells transfected with human
cox-1).
3 in a human whole blood assay, ic50 values for  xxxd2517xxx  were 0.13 mm for cox-2 and 67 mm for
cox-1 (cox-1/cox-2 selectivity ratio 515).
4  xxxd2517xxx  was rapidly absorbed following oral administration in rats with peak plasma levels
being reached between 0.5 and 1 h.
5 ex vivo,  xxxd2517xxx  inhibited cox-1-derived thromboxane b2 (txb2) generation with an id50 of
33 mg kg1, whereas cox-2-derived production of  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) in the lipopolysaccharidestimulated rat air pouch was inhibited with an id50 value of 0.24 mg kg1.
6 efficacy of  xxxd2517xxx  in rat models of hyperalgesia, oedema, pyresis and arthritis was dosedependent and similar to diclofenac. however, consistent with its low cox-1 inhibitory activity,
 xxxd2517xxx  at a dose of 100 mg kg1 orally caused no ulcers and was significantly less ulcerogenic
than diclofenac (po0.05).
7  xxxd2517xxx  is a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and
antipyretic activities comparable with diclofenac, the reference nsaid, but with much improved
gastrointestinal safety.

prostaglandins play key roles in modulating both physiological
and inflammatory processes. they serve as autocrine factors
regulating platelet aggregation, vascular tone and oedema,
secretions from exocrine glands and the neuronal response to
pain, to name but a few. prostaglandin synthesis depends on
the activity of cyclooxygenase (cox), which exists in two
isoforms: cox-1 and cox-2. these two isoforms are highly
homologous in sequence and differ only in one amino acid
at their cox catalytic sites. while differences have been
identified in the requirement for lipid peroxide activation

r. esser et al

(chen et al., 1999) and in substrate preferences (smith et al.,
2000), both isoforms have identical catalytic efficiency and
requirement (km) for  xxxd208xxx . the most profound
difference between the two isoforms relates to their expression
(smith & langenbach, 2001). cox-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues throughout the body (pairet &
engelhardt, 1996). in contrast, cox-2 has a restricted pattern
of distribution under normal physiological conditions, yet is
highly induced at sites of inflammation and cell proliferation
(pairet & engelhardt, 1996).
as a result of these different patterns of expression and
pathophysiological roles, cox-2 selective inhibitors were
developed as a means of achieving anti-inflammatory and
analgesic activity, while potentially sparing the cox-1-dependent physiological functions of gastrointestinal (gi) cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. this hypothesis has been
supported by clinical trials in which other cox-2 selective
inhibitors have been reported to cause a lower incidence of gi
side effects than nonselective cox inhibitors (simon et al.,
1998; bombardier et al., 2000; hunt et al., 2003). however, data
from some studies have also suggested that the cox-2 selective
inhibitor, rofecoxib, may be associated with an increased
cardiovascular risk (bombardier et al., 2000; mamdani et al.,
2004; topol, 2004; fitzgerald, 2004). however, this is not the
case with  xxxd2517xxx . in the therapeutic arthritis research
and gastrointestinal event trial (target) of  xxxd2517xxx  vs
naproxen and ibuprofen (the largest gi outcomes study in
patients with oa performed to date),  xxxd2517xxx  was
associated with a 79% reduction in the incidence of upper gi
ulcer complications with no increase in cardiovascular risk
(farkouh et al., 2004; schnitzer et al., 2004). these recent
findings seem to indicate that any possible increase in
cardiovascular risk associated with some cox-2 selective
inhibitors may be drug-specific rather than class-specific.
the studies presented here describe the preclinical pharmacology of  xxxd2517xxx , a novel highly selective cox-2
inhibitor.  xxxd2517xxx  has a chemical structure distinct from
other cox-2 selective inhibitors, in that it lacks a sulphurcontaining group but has a carboxylic acid moiety, a feature
characteristic of many traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) (figure 1).  xxxd2517xxx  has been found
to bind and interact with the cox-2 enzyme via mechanisms
different from other cox-2 selective inhibitors and carboxylate-containing nonselective cox inhibitors. the carboxylate
group of  xxxd2517xxx  forms hydrogen bonds with the catalytic
tyr385 and with ser530 on cox-2, rather than with the
larger hydrophobic side pocket (as utilised by other cox-2

selective inhibitors developed to date, such as celecoxib) or
with arg120 (as utilised by carboxylate-containing
 xxxd2315xxx -class nonselective nsaids, such as  xxxd2141xxx )
(clark et al., 2004).  xxxd2517xxx  is shown to be highly
selective for cox-2 over cox-1 using a variety of in vitro,
in vivo and ex vivo biochemical measurements and to be
effective in relieving pain and inflammation in a variety of
rodent models. importantly,  xxxd2517xxx  is associated with
improved gi tolerability compared with the nonselective cox
inhibitor, diclofenac.

methods
in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies
the cyclooxygenase inhibitors described in this report were
prepared at novartis pharmaceuticals corporation, and were
authenticated using mass and nmr spectroscopy. unless
otherwise specified, all chemicals and compounds were sourced
from sigma chemical co., st louis, mo, u.s.a. for in vitro
experiments, compounds were first dissolved in dimethyl
sulphoxide (dmso) and diluted into buffer such that the
final concentration of dmso was 0.1%. for ex vivo and
in vivo analyses the compounds were suspended in fortified
cornstarch (3% cornstarch (w v1), 5%  xxxd2982xxx  400
(w v1), 0.34% tween 80 (w v1)) or 1% tragacanth (w v1))
and administered in a volume of either 2 or 5 ml kg1. ovine
cox-1 was obtained from cayman chemical company (ann
arbor, mi, u.s.a.). recombinant human cox-2 was
prepared at novartis according to the procedure described
by wennogle et al. (1995). other preparations used included
stably transfected human cox-1-expressing human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells (atcc, rockville, md, u.s.a.),
human dermal fibroblasts (clonetics, san diego, ca, u.s.a.),
calcium ionophore a23187 and lipopolysaccharide (lps;
sigma chemical co., st louis, mo, u.s.a.; difco laboratories, detroit, mi, u.s.a.).
all in vivo procedures were approved by local novartis
animal care and use committees in accordance with
guidelines in place in the country where the studies were
conducted. male sprague–dawley or wistar rats and female
lewis rats (harlan, indianapolis, in, u.s.a.; charles river
breeding laboratories, wilmington, ma, u.s.a.) were
housed in accredited facilities under standard conditions
for rodents. animals were acclimatised for at least 3 days
prior to use.

inhibition of purified cox-1 and cox-2
inhibition of enzyme activity was determined by measuring
oxygen (o2) consumption in a modification of the methods
of kulmacz & lands (1985) and callan et al. (1996). purified
enzyme preparations with control activities of 80 nmol of o2
consumption min1 were pretreated with inhibitors at 371c for
various lengths of time (0–60 min).  xxxd208xxx  (20 mm)
was then added, and o2 consumption measured using an
oxygen electrode (yellow springs instruments, yellow
springs, oh, u.s.a.). the reaction of inhibitor with enzyme
was assumed to be a simple second-order reaction during both
the preincubation period and the time to highest observed o2
consumption velocity (vopt). an exponential approach to
equilibrium was used, with e–ikt for the preincubation period,
and eiktopt =ð1=ð1þkm =sþþ for time to vopt, where i is the inhibitor
concentration, k is the second-order rate constant (kon), t is the
preincubation time, topt is the time to optimal velocity after the
addition of  xxxd208xxx , km is the michaelis–menten
constant for  xxxd208xxx  and s is the  xxxd208xxx 
concentration. the values for the second-order rate constant
k and equilibrium ki were simultaneously solved from:
vobs ¼ v0 ðð1  f0 þðeikt þ eiktopt =ð1=ð1þkm =sþþ þþ þ f0
where vobs is the observed velocity in the presence of inhibitor,
v0 is the velocity in the absence of inhibitor, and f0 is the
fraction of uninhibited enzyme at equilibrium:
f0 ¼ 1=ð1 þ ðki =iþþ
the half-life (t1/2) for the enzyme-inhibitor complex was
calculated using:
t1=2 ¼ 0:693=ðki  kon þ
constants were fitted for kon, ki, a michaelis–menten
constant for the maximal calculated velocity (vmax), and the
time to vopt. km was 8 mm for cox-1 and 5 mm for cox-2.
for the data sets, the average s.d. of observed vmax ranged
from 6 to 9%.

preclinical pharmacology of  xxxd2517xxx 

is a surrogate measure of cox-2 activity (patrono et al., 1980;
patrignani et al., 1994). the production of txb2 and pge2
were measured in human blood from healthy volunteers.
blood (500 ml) was dispensed into beckman deep well
polypropylene titre plates and incubated in a 5% co2
incubator at 371c. after a 1-h equilibration time, test
compound (range 0.1 nm–300 mm in half log increases) or
dmso carrier (5 ml) was added. the resulting mixture was
then preincubated for a further 1 h, before being divided into
two aliquots – one to be assayed to determine cox-1 activity
and the other for cox-2 activity. to determine cox-1
activity, a23187 (50 mm) was added to one of the aliquots, and
this mixture was then incubated for a further 1 h at 371c with
continuous shaking, after which txb2 production was
assessed. to determine cox-2 activity, lps (10 mg ml1) was
added to the other aliquot, and the resulting mixture
was incubated at 371c overnight, after which pge2 production
was measured.
the samples were centrifuged at 250  g for 10 min at 41c
to collect supernatant and pge2 or txb2 concentrations
were determined in the supernatant using enzyme-linked
chemiluminescence immunoassays (assay designs inc., ann
arbor, mi, u.s.a.). the mean7s.e.m. unstimulated txb2
level was 571 ng ml1 and the a23187-stimulated level was
210740 ng ml1. the mean7s.e.m. unstimulated pge2 level
was 0.2070.06 ng ml1 and the lps-stimulated level was
1775 ng ml1. the level of prostaglandin in each sample was
normalised to the percent inhibition associated with each test
compound. the data from each donor were then pooled and
fitted to a four-parameter logistic function using nonlinear
regression analysis.

in vivo and ex vivo studies
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2517xxx 

cox-1 and cox-2 inhibition in human whole blood assay

male sprague–dawley
rats (225–250 g) were fasted overnight, orally dosed with
5 mg kg1 of  xxxd2517xxx  or diclofenac (sodium salt) as
comparator. blood was collected at scheduled time points
postdose. plasma was separated by centrifugation (15 min at
250  g). samples (50 ml) containing internal standard were
deproteinised by addition of acetonitrile and filtered through
0.45 mm filters before chromatographic separation using a c18
reverse-phase hplc column (ymc ods-am 2  50 mm,
5 mm particle size). the effluent was introduced into the ion
source of the mass spectrometer (lcq ion trap, thermofinnigan, piscataway, nj, u.s.a.) and subjected to atmospheric pressure electrospray ionisation in the negative mode.
compounds were detected by mass spectrometric (ms)
detection (lc/ms/ms (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry)) after fragmentation of the parent
ions. calibration curves and quality control samples were
prepared by spiking known amounts of analyte to internal
standard (ordinate) vs the nominal plasma concentration
(abscissa) and fitted by regression analysis to allow quantitation of the analyte. in all cases, the regression coefficient was
40.99. pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from plasma
concentration vs time curves fitted by noncompartmental
modelling (winnonlin professional 3.0, pharsight corp.,
cary, nc, u.s.a.).

thromboxane b2 (txb2) production from platelets is a
surrogate measure of cox-1 activity, while pge2 production

txb2 measurements serum txb2 was measured in male
sprague–dawley rats (195–225 g) 4 h after administration by

cellular assays for cox-1 and cox-2 inhibition
hek 293 cells, and human dermal fibroblasts (stimulated with
interleukin-1b (il-1b; 10 ng ml1) overnight to upregulate
cox-2) were pretreated with carrier, diclofenac (0.0003–
3 mm), naproxen,  xxxd2517xxx  or celecoxib (0.003–30 mm) for
15 min at 371c.  xxxd208xxx  (40 mm) was then added, and
after a further 15 min incubation, supernatants were harvested
for measurement of  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) by radioimmunoassay (perseptive diagnostics, framingham, ma, u.s.a.).
mean inhibition of pge2 production compared to vehicletreated control cells for each concentration was calculated and
plotted vs the log of the compound concentration, and the ic50
value was calculated using a four-parameter logistic function
using nonlinear regression analysis. typical control pge2
values both for hek 293 cells and human dermal fibroblasts
were 30 ng ml1 following  xxxd208xxx  addition and
o0.1 ng ml1 in the absence of  xxxd208xxx .

gavage of  xxxd2517xxx , diclofenac or vehicle. the rats were
killed by carbon dioxide inhalation, before blood was collected
by cardiac puncture, with one sample taken per animal. the
sample was allowed to clot for 1 h at 371c in a shaking water
bath before serum was separated by centrifugation (15 min at
250  g). txb2 levels were measured by radioimmunoassay
(nen, wilmington, de, u.s.a.). the data were converted to
percent inhibition and fitted to a three-parameter logistic
function using nonlinear regression analysis. the control txb2
value (clotting-induced) was 293 ng ml1.

lps-stimulated pge2 production in the rat air
pouch pge2 concentration was measured in lps-stimulated
dorsal air pouches in female lewis rats (150–180 g). pouches
were produced by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 10 ml of air.
at 24 h after inflation,  xxxd2517xxx  (0.2–2 mg kg1) or diclofenac (0.06–0.6 mg kg1) was administered by gavage. after
1 h, 8 mg of lps suspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline
was injected directly into each pouch (negative control pouches
were injected with sterile phosphate-buffered saline alone).
after 3 h, pouch contents were harvested, and pge2 content
was measured using an enzyme immunoassay (cayman
chemical company, ann arbor, mi, u.s.a.). the data were
converted to percent inhibition and fitted to a four-parameter
logistic function using nonlinear regression analysis. control
pge2 values were 0.5 ng per pouch (unstimulated) and 4–6 ng
per pouch (stimulated).

carrageenan-induced paw oedema male sprague–dawley
rats (200–225 g) were fasted overnight and then orally dosed
with test compound (0.1–3.0 mg kg1). after 1 h, 0.1 ml of 1%
carrageenan was injected into the subplantar region of the left
hind paw. after a further 3 h, the rats were killed and the hind
paws removed at the paw hairline and weighed. oedema was
determined by subtracting the weight of the noninflamed right
paw from the weight of the carrageenan-injected left paw, and
percent inhibition was determined for each animal relative to
the mean of vehicle-treated control rats. ed30 values were
estimated by back-transforming a linear regression model for
percent inhibition as a function of log (dose). control values
were 1.6 g (normal paw) and 3–5 g (inflamed paw).
complete freund’s adjuvant (cfa)-induced hyperalgesia the nociceptive pressure threshold was determined on
the left hind paw of fasted male wistar rats (200–250 g), using
paw-pressure apparatus (analgesy-meter, ugo basile, milan,
italy) and a wedge-shaped probe, just prior to intraplantar
injection of 50 ml of cfa. the end point was taken as paw
withdrawal or struggling. predose nociceptive pressure threshold readings were taken 24 h after cfa administration, with
further measurements taken 1 h after oral administration of
 xxxd2517xxx  or diclofenac. each compound was assayed in
three separate dose–response studies, and the dose at which
30% inhibition of the predose hyperalgesia was achieved (d30)
for each compound was calculated from the combined data.
the mean control values were 111 g (naı̈ve) and 37.1 g
(predose).

lps-induced pyresis male sprague–dawley rats (130–
150 g) received lps by s.c. injection (100 mg kg1) and 2 h later
had their temperature taken. the rats were then placed in
temperature-matched groups. after a further 2 h,  xxxd2517xxx ,

preclinical pharmacology of  xxxd2517xxx 

541

diclofenac or vehicle were administered by gavage, with final
temperature measurements taken 2 h after treatment. the
change in temperature was calculated for each animal and the
percent inhibition compared to the mean of the vehicle-treated
control group (typically 1.8–2.31c).

acute and chronic adjuvant-induced arthritis arthritis
was induced in female lewis rats (125–145 g) by intradermal
injection of heat-killed mycobacterium tuberculosis cells at the
base of the tail. control rats were injected with the  xxxd2648xxx 
alone.
animals were dosed once daily with  xxxd2517xxx , diclofenac
or vehicle beginning 14 days after adjuvant injection and
continuing until day 17. paw volumes were measured using
a plethysmometer (ugo basile, milan, italy) prior to the
initiation of dosing, and again on day 18. percent inhibition of
paw volumes in treated rats relative to control was determined,
and ed50 values calculated as described below.
to model the effect of  xxxd2517xxx  treatment on inflammation associated with chronic arthritis,  xxxd2517xxx  was
administered once daily by gavage (2 mg kg1 day1) beginning
on day 12 and continuing until the day prior to study
termination (day 28). the same dose of diclofenac was used
as a comparator. paw volumes were measured at scheduled
time points (days 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 and 28). at study end,
radiographs (lateral to medial view) were taken of each hind
paw (faxitron x-ray corporation, wheeling, il, u.s.a.),
before the hind paws were processed for histological evaluation. radiographs were scored for soft tissue changes, bone
erosion and periosteal new bone formation on a scale of 1
(normal) to 4 (severe changes). stained sections were scored
for periosteal new bone formation, bone and cartilage erosion,
connective tissue changes and pannus formation. average left–
right values were used for calculation of group means and for
statistical purposes. all assessments of drug effects were
performed in a blinded manner. paw volume control values
were 1.25 ml for normal control rats (i.e. rats that received
vehicle alone) and 2.5 ml for arthritis control rats (paw volume
at day 14 for rats that received adjuvant plus vehicle).
gastrointestinal tolerability to measure gastric ulceration,
fasted male sprague–dawley rats (195–225 g) were treated
with  xxxd2517xxx  (1–100 mg kg1) by gavage. after 4 h, the
stomachs were removed and gross gastric lesions counted
and measured to provide the total lesion length per rat. each
experiment included a comparison with diclofenac (0.3–
100 mg kg1), a known ulcerogen. all assessments of drug
effects were performed in a blinded manner.
to measure the effect of the test compounds on intestinal
permeability, rats were given test compound or vehicle, either
in a single dose or once daily for 4 consecutive days.
immediately following the last dose, each rat was administered
chromium-51-labelled edta (51cr-edta; 5 mci per rat). the
rats were placed in individual metabolic cages and given food
and water ad libitum. urine was collected over a 24-h period.
to quantify the effect of treatment on intestinal permeability,
the level of 51cr-edta in the urine of compound-treated rats
was compared with that in rats that received vehicle. the
percentage permeability for the vehicle-treated rats was
1.970.1 in the single-dose study and 1.5970.06 in the fourdose group.

statistics
statistical comparisons between the vehicle-treated control
and compound-treated groups were made by anova
followed by either dunn’s (intestinal permeability), dunnett’s
(chronic adjuvant arthritis) or tukey’s (carrageenan oedema)
post hoc tests. p-values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. plots for percent inhibition vs dose
were fitted by linear or nonlinear regression for calculation of
ic50, ed30, ed50 or d30 values.

results
inhibition of purified cox-1 and cox-2
the mechanism and kinetics of inhibition of cox activity
were studied using purified enzyme preparations of ovine
cox-1 and human recombinant cox-2. changes in o2
concentrations were monitored to follow enzymatic activity
in real time. this approach allowed for kinetic characterisation
of interactions between inhibitor and enzyme.
 xxxd2517xxx  was rapidly and reversibly bound to cox-1
with micromolar affinity (table 1). the cox-2 selective
inhibitor celecoxib displayed similar kinetic behaviour and
potency. in contrast, the interaction of diclofenac with cox-1
was different, showing time-dependent inhibition and tight
binding with an affinity of 0.01 mm. for cox-2, all of the
inhibitors studied showed time-dependent inhibition, with
a defined initial rate of interaction followed by the formation
of complexes with various degrees of stability.  xxxd2517xxx 
demonstrated potent inhibition of cox-2 (ki ¼ 0.06 mm)
forming a tight complex as indicated by its long dissociation
t1/2. diclofenac’s ki value was 0.01 mm, while celecoxib was less
potent (ki ¼ 0.2 mm) forming a weaker complex with cox-2 as
evidenced by its relatively short dissociation t1/2.

inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 in cell-based assays
 xxxd2517xxx  inhibited cox-2-dependent pge2 production,
assessed using il-1b-stimulated dermal fibroblasts, with an
ic50 value of 0.14 mm (figure 2). this was similar to the ic50 of
0.31 mm observed for celecoxib.  xxxd2517xxx  did not inhibit
cox-1-dependent pge2 production (assessed using cox-1
stably transfected hek 293 cells) even at 30 mm, the highest
concentration tested. the same concentration of celecoxib
reduced cox-1-dependent pge2 production by 50%.

table 1

preclinical pharmacology of  xxxd2517xxx 

naproxen and diclofenac inhibited pge2 production in both
il-1b-induced dermal fibroblasts and stably transfected hek
293 cell cultures. naproxen ic50 values in the cox-1 and
cox-2 cellular assays were similar, being approximately 2 mm.
diclofenac inhibited pge2 production in both cell types with
ic50 values of 0.13 mm in the cox-1 cell-based assay and
0.01 mm in the cox-2 cell-based assay.

inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 in human whole blood
assay
assessing inhibition of cox activity in human whole blood
has become a standard approach to gauge the selectivity of a
compound (flower, 2003). for this assay, heparinised human
blood was divided into two aliquots: one for measuring txb2
production and a second for measuring pge2 production. all
compounds tested produced concentration-dependent inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis where the span from 25 to 80%
inhibition was achieved over a concentration range of
approximately 1.5 log units (figure 3).  xxxd2517xxx  was a
highly selective inhibitor of pge2 (ic50 ¼ 0.13 mm) achieving
approximately 100% inhibition of pge2 synthesis at concentrations of approximately 1 mm, while showing little inhibition
of txb2 production at concentrations up to 10 mm.
table 2 compares the relative potencies of  xxxd2517xxx  and
other clinically used cox inhibitors. the nonselective cox
inhibitors studied include diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen.
while absolute potencies differ from one drug to another,
these compounds show little preference in their selectivity for
either of the two cox isoforms. in contrast, the cox-2
selective inhibitors show similar potencies towards cox-2, but
differ in their cox-1 inhibitory potency. as such,  xxxd2517xxx 
is the least active agent against cox-1 but has the highest
overall cox-2 selectivity (cox-2 : cox-1 ratio 515).
three major metabolites of  xxxd2517xxx  have been identified
in rat and human. these metabolites are the 40 -hydroxy,
5-carboxy and 40 -hydroxy-5-carboxy metabolites (mangold
et al., 2004). only the 40 -hydroxy metabolite demonstrated
cox inhibitory activity in the human whole blood assay,

third that of the parent compound (table 2). the other two
metabolites did not reach 30% inhibition for cox-1 or cox2 activity, even at the highest concentrations tested (300 mm).

inhibition of txb2 and pge2 production was determined in separate aliquots of blood that had been pretreated with compounds for 1 h.
txb2 production was stimulated with the addition of a23187 (50 mm) and assessed after 1 h incubation. pge2 production was induced with
lps (10 mg ml1) and assessed after overnight incubation. prostanoid production was normalised to percent inhibition and the results from
the donors pooled. the ic50 indicated here is the mean value for the number of donors indicated in parentheses, along with the s.e.mean.
the cox-2 selectivity represents the ratio of ic50 for cox-1 divided by cox-2.

production was seen with  xxxd2517xxx  3 mg kg1 (but complete
inhibition of cox-2-dependent pge2 production), while, in
contrast, diclofenac at 5 mg kg1 produced up to 50%
inhibition of cox-1-dependent txb2 production.

relatively quickly, resulting in a greater overall exposure for

(auc 5.170.5 mg ml1 h1).

in a dose-dependent inhibition of serum txb2. however, the
respective id50 values for diclofenac (5 mg kg1) and  xxxd2517xxx  (33 mg kg1) showed  xxxd2517xxx  to be a much less
potent inhibitor of cox-1 than diclofenac (figure 5). for
example, no discernible inhibition of cox-1-dependent txb2

causes the formation of an in vivo chamber, termed an air
pouch, which over several days spontaneously develops a
highly reactive lining tissue composed primarily of macrophage- and fibroblast-like cells (sedgwick et al., 1983). when
lps is injected into this experimentally produced tissue
compartment, it rapidly induces the production of pge2, a
process which is largely derived from cox-2 originating in the
lining tissue (masferrer et al., 1994; appleton et al., 1995).
when this model was used for the in vivo assessment of
cox-2 inhibition,  xxxd2517xxx  provided more than 90%
inhibition at the highest dose tested (range 0.2–2 mg kg1,
id50 0.24 mg kg1; figure 5), an efficacy similar to that seen for
the highest tested dose of diclofenac (range 0.06–0.6 mg kg1,
id50 0.12 mg kg1).

in vivo measures of anti-inflammatory efficacy
carrageenan-induced paw oedema the carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema assay is widely used to evaluate the
anti-inflammatory activity of nsaids and other anti-inflammatory agents in vivo (mukherjee et al., 1996).
 xxxd2517xxx  dose-dependently reduced carrageenan-induced paw oedema compared with vehicle-treated rats,
showing an ed30 value of 0.35 mg kg1 (figure 6a). diclofenac
also reduced paw oedema (ed30 0.53 mg kg1), with no
statistically significant difference in the ed30 values for the
two compounds. the maximum efficacy seen with  xxxd2517xxx 
was identical to diclofenac.

inhibition (7s.e.m.) for serum txb2 (n ¼ 5–6 rats per dose) or air
pouch pge2 (n ¼ 9–12 rats per dose). txb2 levels were determined
ex vivo by radioimmunoassay of extracts from clotted blood
sampled from rats 4 h after dosing. cox-2 activity was assessed
by measuring pge2 concentration in lps-stimulated dorsal air
pouches 4 h after dosing.

cfa-induced hyperalgesia several groups have shown
that an elevation in the expression of cox-2 gene products
occurs in both the periphery and spinal cord following
peripheral cfa-injection into the rat paw and that selective
cox-2 inhibitors produced analgesic activity (hay et al., 1997;
samad et al., 2001). the aim was to employ a model of
persistent nociceptive or inflammatory pain in the absence of
frank inflammation, which mimics the concept of central
sensitisation. cfa produces short-lasting oedema (hours) and
hyperalgesia lasting from a few hours up to 7–10 days.
hyperalgesia was measured 24 h following cfa injection,
when oedema had subsided but there was establishment of
peripheral and central sensitisation. anti-nociception activity
in inflamed tissue was evaluated by comparing the change in
pressure threshold from baseline for the inflamed paw of test
compound-treated rats with that in vehicle-treated rats.
treatment with either  xxxd2517xxx  or diclofenac inhibited
hyperalgesia compared with predose levels, with maximal
reversal of 60–65%. for both compounds, inhibition was dose
dependent (figure 6b), with d30 values of 5.1 and 5.5 mg kg1,
for  xxxd2517xxx  and diclofenac, respectively.
lps-induced pyresis nonselective cox inhibitors, such as
diclofenac, are antipyretic in both human and animal models
of pyresis (bettini et al., 1986).  xxxd2517xxx  (0.3–10 mg kg1)
and diclofenac (0.03–1 mg kg1) produced similar levels of

dependent (figure 6c), with ed50 values calculated as 1 and
0.13 mg kg1 for  xxxd2517xxx  and diclofenac, respectively.

acute and chronic adjuvant-induced arthritis intradermal
injection of rats with heat-killed m. tuberculosis (adjuvant)
reproducibly induces chronic, inflammatory arthritis accompanied by degradation of cartilage and bone that eventually
leads to joint destruction (whitehouse, 1988). the disease is
driven largely by prostaglandin production, as evidenced by
inhibition of disease severity by nsaids (billingham, 1983)
and cox-2 selective inhibitors (anderson et al., 1996).
administration of  xxxd2517xxx  or diclofenac beginning 14
days after adjuvant injection (i.e. during the period of rapidly
increasing inflammation severity) limited disease progression.
after a 4-day course of treatment, progression of inflammation was either slowed or reversed, depending on the dose of
compound administered. ed50 values, measured after 4 days’
treatment, were 5 mg kg1 for  xxxd2517xxx  and 3 mg kg1 for
diclofenac (figure 7a).
in chronic disease, both compounds significantly decreased
clinical severity, as measured by paw volumes (figure 7b).
mean histological scores of stained hind paw sections collected
at study termination were reduced by 45 and 47% (both
po0.05) in rats treated with  xxxd2517xxx  and diclofenac,
respectively. radiograph scores were reduced by 54%

no ulcers were observed in rats treated orally with any of the
 xxxd2517xxx  doses (1–100 mg kg1). in contrast, oral administration of diclofenac at doses as low as 3 mg kg1 caused a low
incidence of ulcers (in three out of 18 rats) with a mean
(7s.e.m.) ulcer length of 0.670.5 mm. moreover, the incidence and size of ulcers in diclofenac-treated rats increased
with the dose administered, resulting in severe gastric lesions

intestinal permeability
the mean excretion of 51cr-edta in urine of rats given a
single dose of  xxxd2517xxx  (30 mg kg1) was similar to that
of vehicle-treated control rats (table 3). a single dose of
diclofenac (30 mg kg1) significantly increased 51cr-edta
excretion compared with controls.
in rats given daily doses over 4 days, excretion of 51credta in the 24-h period immediately following the last dose
of  xxxd2517xxx  (10 mg kg1) was also similar to excretion in
vehicle-treated control rats, but diclofenac (3 or 10 mg kg1)
significantly increased 51cr-edta excretion over the levels
observed in control rats (table 3). higher doses of  xxxd2517xxx 
(30 or 100 mg kg1) caused significant increases in 51cr-edta
excretion relative to vehicle-treated controls. 51cr-edta
excretion could not be measured in rats treated with multiple
doses of 30 or 100 mg kg1 of diclofenac because of druginduced toxicity.

discussion

figure 7 effects of  xxxd2517xxx  and diclofenac treatment on
clinical severity of adjuvant-induced arthritis. (a) rats were injected
with m. tuberculosis and arranged into groups of equal severity on
day 14. rats were treated daily with  xxxd2517xxx  or diclofenac for 4
consecutive days. values represent the mean percent inhibition
(7s.e.m.) of paw volume 24 h after the final dose of compounds
(mean from two experiments, n ¼ 4 rats per treatment group in each
experiment). (b) rats were injected with adjuvant on day 1 and
treated with  xxxd2517xxx  or diclofenac (both at 2 mg kg1) once daily
from day 12 until termination of the experiment. arthritis and
normal control rats were given vehicle alone. paw volumes were
measured periodically during the course of disease. values shown
are mean volumes7s.e.m. (mean from four experiments, n ¼ 6 rats
per treatment group in each experiment).

there has been considerable effort in the pharmaceutical
industry to identify a cox-2 selective inhibitor with antiinflammatory properties but without the adverse effects
associated with traditional nsaids (flower, 2003). our
studies describe the preclinical pharmacology of  xxxd2517xxx ,
the first carboxyl, non-sulphur-containing cox-2 selective
inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity
(table 4). consistent with its weak activity on cox-1, the
gastric tolerability of  xxxd2517xxx  is significantly better than
that of diclofenac, a comparator that nonselectively inhibits
both cox-1 and cox-2.
we established the biochemical potency and cox-2
selectivity of  xxxd2517xxx  in several assays using purified
enzyme preparations, intact cells and in whole blood and
tissues. against purified enzymes,  xxxd2517xxx  proved to be a
potent, time-dependent inhibitor of cox-2 and a weak,
nontime-dependent, competitive inhibitor of cox-1. this
kinetic profile has been observed for other cox-2 selective
inhibitors (gierse et al., 1999). in the cellular assay,
 xxxd2517xxx  was shown to inhibit cox-2 activity but to have
little effect on cox-1 activity.
the need for a standard assay to evaluate cox-2 selectivity
led to the development and acceptance of the whole blood

assay. in this assay, inhibition of platelet txb2 (cox-1
dependent) and lps-stimulated monocyte pge2 (cox-2
dependent) production provide the necessary end points for
determining potency and selectivity (patrignani et al., 1994;
cryer & feldman, 1998; warner et al., 1999). to help gauge
relative potency and cox-2 selectivity,  xxxd2517xxx  was
compared with a variety of clinically used traditional nsaids
and cox-2 selective inhibitors using this standard assay.
 xxxd2517xxx  demonstrated a 515-fold preference for inhibition
of cox-2 as opposed to cox-1. moreover, 100% inhibition
of cox-2 was achieved at a  xxxd2517xxx  concentration that
produced no cox-1 inhibition. this contrasts with celecoxib,
diclofenac and naproxen where the drug concentration that
maximally inhibits cox-2 also substantially inhibits cox-1
activity (figure 3). it should be noted that the in vitro
biochemical potency (ic50 0.13 mm) and cox-2 selectivity of
 xxxd2517xxx  observed in the whole blood assay were comparable to those found ex vivo in human clinical trials, where the
cox-2 ic50 was 0.18 mm and no inhibition of cox-1 was
observed with supratherapeutic doses up to 800 mg (plasma
cmax 36 mm; scott et al., 2002).
the degree of selectivity in the in vitro assays presented
in this manuscript varied widely. similar degrees of variability
have been reported by others in sometimes closely related
assay systems (warner et al., 1999), and striking differences in
measures of selectivity (approximately 1000-fold) have been
reported between assays that utilised purified enzymes and
whole blood assays (gierse et al., 1999; riendeau et al., 2001).
the variation has been attributed to differences in substrate
concentration, preincubation time, binding of drug by proteins

preclinical pharmacology of  xxxd2517xxx 

547

and other factors in the various assay systems. regardless of
the explanation for the differences in selectivity, a similar rank
ordering of compounds (with  xxxd2517xxx  as the most selective
cox-2 inhibitor) is observed in the results from different
laboratories, and the rank order as well as potency of
comparator compounds in this report is consistent with
published data (chan et al., 1999; warner et al., 1999; patrono
et al., 2001).
the biochemical selectivity for cox-2 inhibition by
 xxxd2517xxx  was also demonstrated both ex vivo and in vivo.
txb2 generation by blood platelets is derived from cox-1
(patrono et al., 1980; patrignani et al., 1994), therefore, the ex
vivo measurement of txb2 inhibition in blood from animals
given cox inhibitors can provide an index for cox-1
inhibition. in contrast, pge2 production in the rat air pouch
is derived from cox-2 (masferrer et al., 1994), and inhibition
of pge2 production therefore serves as a surrogate for cox-2
inhibition. when tested 4 h after oral dosing,  xxxd2517xxx 
reduced the cox-1-dependent txb2 production in rat blood
with an id50 of 33 mg kg1. this contrasts with the potency of
0.24 mg kg1 for cox-2-dependent pge2 production in the rat
air pouch also measured at 4 h postdose. moreover, the
2 mg kg1 dose of  xxxd2517xxx  that achieved maximal inhibition of cox-2 activity caused no inhibition of cox-1 activity.
 xxxd2517xxx  is rapidly absorbed and quickly reaches peak
plasma levels. this can be attributed to its solubility at the site
of absorption (water solubility at ph 3 o0.01 g l1; water
solubility at ph 6.8 ¼ 0.17 g l1; novartis data on file), degree
of ionisation (pka 4.7; mangold et al., 2004) and the relative
lipid solubility of its ionised and nonionised forms (log p at ph
6.8 ¼ 1.76; novartis data on file). differences in overall
exposure between  xxxd2517xxx  and diclofenac suggests a
relatively faster clearance of diclofenac possibly associated
with known differences in the metabolic oxidative pathways of
the two compounds ( xxxd2517xxx  is metabolised predominantly by cytochrome p450 [cyp] 2c9, whereas diclofenac is
metabolised by cyp2c9 and cyp3a4) and in the metabolites
formed (degen et al., 1988; boelsterli, 2003; mangold et al.,
2004; scott et al., 2004b). after oral dosing in humans, the
major metabolites of diclofenac are the 30 -hydroxy, 40 -hydroxy
and 5-hydroxy metabolites (stierlin et al., 1979). in comparison, the three major metabolites of  xxxd2517xxx  in rat and
man are the 40 -hydroxy, 5-carboxy and 40 -hydroxy-5-carboxy
metabolites (mangold et al., 2004; novartis data on file). here,
we report that only the 40 -hydroxy metabolite-inhibited cox
activity in human blood with cox-2 potency and selectivity
being three-fold less than that observed for  xxxd2517xxx 
(table 2). the exposure and half-life for the 40 -hydroxy
metabolite was not studied in this report. in man, the plasma
levels of 40 -hydroxy- xxxd2517xxx  are only 10% of those of the
parent molecule; thus, this metabolite is unlikely to contribute
to pharmacological activity in man (mangold et al., 2004).
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2517xxx  in healthy humans is
similar to that observed in these preclinical studies, revealing
a pharmacokinetic profile distinct from the other cox-2
selective inhibitors. in man,  xxxd2517xxx  has a much lower
volume of distribution (approximately 9 l) than the other
cox-2 selective inhibitors (celecoxib approximately 400 l,
 xxxd3481xxx  approximately 90 l,  xxxd2069xxx  approximately 120 l
and rofecoxib approximately 90 l) (hartmann et al., 2003;
brune & hinz, 2004). whereas  xxxd2517xxx  demonstrates
preferential distribution into inflamed synovial fluid (scott
british journal of pharmacology vol 144 (4)

548

r. esser et al

et al., 2004a), rofecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx  and  xxxd2069xxx  distribute
almost equally throughout the body, while celecoxib (due to its
high lipophilicity) may be sequestered in body fat (brune &
hinz, 2004).  xxxd2517xxx  and  xxxd2069xxx  are absorbed more
rapidly than the other cox-2 selective inhibitors (tmax 1–3 h),
while  xxxd2517xxx  demonstrates the most rapid plasma
elimination (t1/2 3–6 h) (scott et al., 2002; brune & hinz,
2004). this rapid absorption and plasma elimination, combined with preferential distribution into inflamed tissue, means
that in contrast to the other cox-2 selective inhibitors, there is
reduced systemic cox-2 inhibition with  xxxd2517xxx .
 xxxd2517xxx  was found to be effective in a variety of
standard rat models used to establish nsaid pharmacological
activity, including hyperalgesia, oedema, pyresis and arthritis.
the efficacy of  xxxd2517xxx  was identical to diclofenac, and the
potency was generally comparable. the finding that a lower
dose of  xxxd2517xxx  is required in the carrageenan oedema and
air pouch models compared with that required in adjuvantinduced arthritis is thought to be a reflection of the differences
in the amount of time during which the inhibitor needs to be
present in the various models. in both the air pouch and the
oedema models, efficacy is measured 4 h after compound
administration. in contrast, to be effective in adjuvant-induced
arthritis, a compound must be present for a much longer interval
(approaching 24 h), since treatment must impact a continuous
disease process lasting for days. when the half-life (4 h or five
half-life intervals following the tmax) is taken into account to
adjust drug exposure, the difference between the acute models
(4 h) vs adjuvant (daily for 4 days) all but disappears.
in the cfa-hyperalgesia model, the effective dose of
 xxxd2517xxx  was much higher than seen in the other acute
models. it is unlikely that the high dose reflects a non-cox-2
mechanism since many structurally dissimilar nsaids and
cox-2 selective inhibitors require higher doses to show
efficacy in this model (data not shown). it may, perhaps, be
a consequence of a compartment that these drugs cannot
readily access. alternatively, the high dose may reflect a higher
threshold of inhibition, which is needed to observe therapeutic
activity in this model of pain. a comparable situation exists in
man where higher doses of many nsaids and cox-2
selective inhibitors are required to treat acute pain compared
to osteoarthritis pain (abbott laboratories limited 2002;
merck, sharp & dohme limited 2004a, b, c; pharmacia
limited 2004). on the other hand, the high dose may reflect
the difficulty in reducing cox-2 activity after the onset of
inflammation.

preclinical pharmacology of  xxxd2517xxx 

gi safety of  xxxd2517xxx  was significantly superior to the
nonselective nsaid diclofenac. single doses of  xxxd2517xxx 
did not cause apparent stomach ulcers at doses of 100 mg kg1
(a dose 20 times that needed to achieve the ed50 for adjuvant
arthritis), whereas ulcers were observed following doses of
3 mg kg1 of diclofenac. similarly, excretion of 51cr-edta in
urine – a measure of intestinal permeability – was lower in
 xxxd2517xxx -treated than in diclofenac-treated rats. some have
suggested that, instead of being solely due to inhibition of
gastric protection afforded by cox-1, stomach ulceration
caused by nsaids is partly attributable to topical toxicity as a
consequence of their physical and chemical characteristics
(smale & bjarnason, 2003). namely, their hydrophobic and
acidic characteristics disrupt the protective mucus layer and
expose the underlying stomach epithelial cells to the acidic ph
of stomach secretions (lichtenberger et al., 1995). additionally, acidic nsaids may accumulate due to ion trapping
within intestinal enterocytes reaching concentrations that lead
to uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(krause et al., 2003). neither of these hypothetical mechanisms seem to play a prominent role in the rodent model studied
here since  xxxd2517xxx  and diclofenac have very similar
hydrophobic (water/octanol partitioning) and acidic properties
(pka), yet have very different gastric liabilities.
our findings agree with other published reports that show
efficacy of cox-2 selective inhibitors in animal models (futaki
et al., 1993; masferrer et al., 1994; chan et al., 1999; riendeau
et al., 2001), but differs from some reports suggesting limited
effectiveness of cox-2 selective inhibitors compared with
nonselective cox inhibitors (gilroy et al., 1998; wallace et al.,
1999; pinheiro & calixto, 2002).  xxxd2517xxx  possesses a high
cox-2 selectivity. in rodent models, which have served as
standard tools in the development of traditional nsaids,
 xxxd2517xxx  at doses well below those needed to inhibit cox-1
provides the same degree of efficacy as nonselective nsaids in
reducing pain, fever and inflammation. in contrast to traditional nsaids, the high cox-2 selectivity of  xxxd2517xxx 
translates into superior gi safety. in addition to differentiating
 xxxd2517xxx  from nonselective nsaids, its different physical,
chemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics may allow valuable distinctions to be made between  xxxd2517xxx  and currently
available cox-2 selective inhibitors.
we acknowledge the assistance of james wasvary and kevin west for
their invaluable contribution to the experimental work and preparation of this manuscript.
