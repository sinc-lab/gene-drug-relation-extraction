 xxxd2155xxx  in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  bronchodilators represent the hallmark of symptomatic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). there are four categories of bronchodilators: anticholinergics, methylxanthines, short-acting  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -agonists, and long-acting  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -agonists such as  xxxd2155xxx . significant research has been performed to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of  xxxd2155xxx  in the therapeutic field of copd.  xxxd2155xxx  exhibits a rapid onset of bronchodilation similar to that observed with salbutamol, yet its long bronchodilatory duration is comparable to salmeterol. in addition,  xxxd2155xxx  presents with a clear superiority in lung function improvement compared with either ipratropium bromide or oral theophylline, while its efficacy improves when administered in combination with ipratropium.  xxxd2155xxx  has been shown to better reduce dynamic hyperinflation, which is responsible for exercise intolerance and dyspnea in copd patients, compared with other bronchodilators, whereas it exerts synergistic effect with tiotropium. moreover,  xxxd2155xxx  reduces exacerbations, increases days free of use of rescue medication and improves patients' quality of life and disease symptoms.  xxxd2155xxx  has a favorable safety profile and is better tolerated than theophylline. collectively, data extracted from multicenter clinical trials support  xxxd2155xxx  as a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of copd.
