 xxxd52xxx : a review of a new biologic agent for refractory rheumatoid
arthritis for dermatologists

abstract
 xxxd52xxx  is a newly approved treatment for rheumatoid arthritis refractory to other agents.  xxxd52xxx  is a fusion protein of
the cytotoxic t-lymphocyte antigen (ctla) molecule and immunoglobulin (ig) g1 that blocks cd28. specifically,
 xxxd52xxx  blocks the  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  ligands on the surface of antigen-presenting cells that must interface with the t-cell’s
cd28 receptor to activate t cells.  xxxd52xxx  seems to be more immunosuppressive than  xxxg2296xxx  alpha
blockers. the combination of  xxxd52xxx  and a  xxxg2296xxx  alpha blocking agent does not seem more effective than
either agent alone. because  xxxd52xxx  has the ability to suppress t-cell function, it has the potential to be a treatment for
psoriasis and other autoimmune conditions involving pathologic processes driven by t cells.

introduction
on 23 december 2005 the fda approved  xxxd52xxx 
( xxxd52xxx ) in adult patients with moderately to
severely active ra who have had an inadequate
response to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards; e.g. methotrexate,
 xxxd2450xxx ,  xxxd2301xxx ,  xxxd3255xxx ), or tumor
necrosis factor alpha ( xxxg2296xxx ) antagonists (e.g.
etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab) (1–11). for
(1) treatingrheumatoid arthritis (ra),(2) reducing
the signs and symptoms of ra, (3) inducing major
clinical response, (4) slowing the progression of
structural damage, and (5) improving physical
function in such patients.  xxxd52xxx  may be used
as monotherapy or concomitantly with dmards
other than  xxxg2296xxx  antagonists.  xxxd52xxx  should not
be administered concomitantly with  xxxg2296xxx  blockers
or anakinra (1–7).
 xxxd52xxx  is a fusion protein of the cytotoxic tlymphocyte antigen (ctla) molecule and immunoglobulin (ig) g1 that blocks costimulation of t
cells, down-regulating t-cell activation.  xxxd52xxx  is
the first-in-class selective t-cell co-stimulation
modulator (1–7). specifically,  xxxd52xxx  blocks the
 xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  ligands on the surface of antigenpresenting cells (apcs) that must interface with the
t-cell’s cd28 receptor to potentiate t cells.

 xxxd52xxx , a fusion protein of cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (ctla-4) linked to
 xxxd2890xxx  (igg1), inhibits the binding of
these ligands to cd28, stopping t-cell activation
and down-regulating serum concentrations of
inflammatory markers, cytokines and rheumatoid
factor (1–7).
it should be noted that cytotoxic t-lymphocyte
antigen-4 (ctla-4;  xxxg544xxx ) is a member of the
immunoglobulin gene super-family with strong
homology to the receptor cd28 with which it shares
the ligands  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx . unlike cd28, a
potent costimulator of t-cell responses, ctla-4
(cd-152) is expressed only transiently on the cell
surface of activated t cells. ctla-4 seems to work
mostly as a negative regulator of t-cell proliferation.

clinical trials
the approval of the medication was based on
subanalyses of two large, phase 3, randomized,
clinical trials reported previously: one evaluating
 xxxd52xxx  in patients with active disease in the face
of concurrent use of methotrexate ( xxxd52xxx  in
inadequate responders to methotrexate [aim]
study) and the second evaluating response
in patients who were non-responders to  xxxg2296xxx

inhibitors ( xxxd52xxx  trial in treatment of antitnfa inadequate responders [attain]) (9–11).
the results of these trials are provided in table i
(1–7,9–11).
follow-up data have come in a number of
abstracts presented at the rheumatology 2005
annual scientific meeting (table ii), and show that
 xxxd52xxx  is safe and effective (5). these studies also
show that  xxxd52xxx  has an acceptable side-effect
profile, lacks additive effect with  xxxg2296xxx  blockers and
is effective in many ways for improving the signs and
symptoms of ra (table ii).
even more recent data are available from a study
from the netherlands. westhovens et al. (8) entered
patients into a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicentre, randomized, clinical trial, with 258
patients randomized to  xxxd52xxx +disease-modifying
anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) and 133 patients
randomized to placebo+dmards. quality of life
was assessed using the short form health survey
(sf-36), health assessment questionnaire (haq)
and fatigue visual analogue scale, and was analyzed
with basic (anova, chi-squared) and multigroup
growth curve techniques to measure alterations of
the disease’s extent and effect in a specified period.
the treatment group’s quality of life improved more
than that of the placebo group on the haq and
fatigue indices, as well as seven of the eight sf-36
scales and sf-36 physical and mental summary
scores. the improvement rate occurred more
rapidly with  xxxd52xxx -treated patients than with

placebo-treated patients based on the quality of life
metrics, and the improvements from  xxxd52xxx 
related to normal levels of quality of life in many
areas evaluated.

administration and side effects
 xxxd52xxx  is given as an intravenous infusion (iv)
administered over 30 minutes. following the initial
administration,  xxxd52xxx  is given at 2 and 4 weeks,
then every 4 weeks thereafter (1–7).
the side-effect profile of  xxxd52xxx  has been
detailed. acute infusion-related reactions occurred
in 9% of  xxxd52xxx  and 6% of placebo recipients in
phase 3 trials. integrated safety data from five
clinical trials showed that serious adverse events
were reported in 13.6% of  xxxd52xxx  and 12.3% of
placebo recipients, and the incidence of serious
infections was 3.0% and 1.9% (1–7). as such,
 xxxd52xxx  seems to be more immunosuppressive
than  xxxg2296xxx  agents. patients who received  xxxd52xxx 
concurrently with a  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitor had a higher
incidence of infections (63% vs 43%) and serious
infections (4.4% vs 0.8%) than those receiving
 xxxg2296xxx  blockers alone. no data are available on the
use of  xxxd52xxx  with anakinra. other dmards
taken concurrently with  xxxd52xxx  did not increase
the incidence of adverse effects (1–7).
the overall incidence of malignancy with  xxxd52xxx - and placebo-treated patients is currently

short-term data analysis. interestingly, four cases of
lung cancer occurred with  xxxd52xxx  and none with
placebo; the significance of this is uncertain. patients

 xxxd52xxx  for refractory rheumatoid arthritis

preliminary data seems to indicate that inhibition of
cd28 ameliorates autoimmune diseases including
 xxxg1055xxx  (12), juvenile idiopathic
arthritis (jia) (13), chronic arthritis (due to inflammation in synovial dendritic cells), psoriasis (14),
colitis (15) and lupus (16). in particular,  xxxg544xxx -ig,
a novel inhibitor of co-stimulation of t cells, seems a
promising target in the treatment of lupus (16).
inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine generation
by molecules like  xxxd52xxx  in the skin and colon of
mice adoptively transplanted with cd45rbhi cd4+
t cells correlates with suppression of psoriasis and
colitis (17). similarly, psoriatic skin-derived dendritic cell function is inhibited by exogenous il-10 and
is involved with differential modulation of  xxxg396xxx 
( xxxg396xxx ) and  xxxg398xxx  ( xxxg398xxx ) expression, which are
related to the activity and activation of cd28 (18).
moreover, there appears to be greater cd-28
expression in lesional psoriatic skin than in perilesional psoriatic skin (19).
there is scientific rationale for these potential
clinical effects of  xxxd52xxx . naive t-cells potentiation needs two signals. one is antigen-specific and
the other antigen-nonspecific. the antigen-nonspecific signal is founded on t-cell receptor (tcr)
recognition of a peptide-mhc complex (20). the
antigen-specific signal involves binding of specific
t-cell receptors with their ligands (co-stimulatory
molecules) on antigen-presenting cells (apcs).
deployment of the b7 group of molecules on
antigen presenting cells with their t-cell associated
ligands, cd28 and ctla-4 ( xxxg544xxx ), furnishes a
key co-stimulatory signal in t-cell activation. failure
to convey both antigen-specific and the other
antigen-nonspecific signals results in an immune
system that can not respond to stimuli i.e. anergy.
the actions of  xxxd105xxx , a monoclonal antibody
used for the treatment of psoriasis inhibit signaling
of t-cell fashion in a fashion somewhat analogous to the fashion just outlined. upregulation of
expression of il-8 (a factor important in neutophil
function) (the neutrophil is an inflammatory cell
found in psoriatic lesions) in t cells uses the cd28
co-stimulatory pathway for amplification (21).

conclusion
 xxxd52xxx  is a significant, new medication in a new
class of medications for patients who do not respond
to tnf blockers or are not candidates for tnf
blockers or for methotrexate. only a minority of
patients does not respond to tnf blockers used
with dmards; importantly, this minority has a
new treatment option. it is interesting that used in
conjunction with a  xxxg2296xxx  blocker,  xxxd52xxx  has
no synergistic effect at ameliorating ra. it is also
unsurprising that like  xxxg2296xxx  blockers,  xxxd52xxx  can
increase the risk of infection. it is puzzling however
that despite their lack of therapeutic synergy, they
have an additive effect in increasing the rate of
infection. undoubtedly,  xxxd52xxx  will be studied in
patients with other diseases, such as psoriasis, in
which t activation and potentiation have a role.
thus, it is important for dermatologists to be aware
of this exciting new medication.
