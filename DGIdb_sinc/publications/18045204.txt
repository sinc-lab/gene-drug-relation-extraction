abstract: 20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( xxxg113xxx ) plays a key role in the metabolism of progesterone and other
steroid hormones, thereby regulating their action at the pre-receptor level.  xxxg113xxx  is implicated in neurological and psychiatric conditions such as catamenial epilepsy and depressive disorders. increased activity of  xxxg113xxx  is associated with
termination of pregnancy and the development of breast cancer, endometriosis and endometrial cancer. inhibition of the
undesired activity of  xxxg113xxx  will help reduce risks of premature birth, neurological disorders and the development of
cancer. in order to identify potential leads for new inhibitors of  xxxg113xxx  we adopted a virtual screening-based approach
using the automated dock program. approximately 250,000 compounds from the nci database were screened for potential ligands based on their chemical complementarity and steric fit within the active site of  xxxg113xxx . kinetic analysis
revealed  xxxd623xxx , an analogue of  xxxd3159xxx , as a potent competitive inhibitor with respect to the substrate 5-pregnane-3,20-diol with a ki of 9 nm. aspirin, which is a well known  xxxd3159xxx -based drug, was also
found to inhibit  xxxg113xxx  activity. this is the first report to show aspirin (ic50=21 m) and its metabolite  xxxd3159xxx 
(ic50=7.8 m) as inhibitors of  xxxg113xxx .

key words: enzyme inhibitors, molecular docking,  xxxd3159xxx , 20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, aldo-keto reductase.
introduction
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (hsds) regulate the
availability of steroid hormones such as progesterone, estrogen, androgens, glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids to
their corresponding receptors. these enzymes act as molecular switches that regulate receptor occupancy and activation
by catalysing the interconversion of potent steroid hormones
to their inactive counterparts making them important drug
targets [1-3]. hsds belong to two distinct protein superfamilies, the short chain dehydrogenase/ reductasesand the aldoketo reductases (akrs). there are four human 3-hsd isoforms which belong to the akr1c subfamily, namely,
 xxxg113xxx ,  xxxg114xxx ,  xxxg115xxx  and  xxxg116xxx  [4, 5]. although
these isoforms share high sequence identity (>84%) they
exhibit broad substrate specificity and are implicated in diverse physiological functions. each of the four isoforms
catalyse the reduction of 3-, 17-, 20-ketosteroids and also
catalyse the oxidation of 3-, 17- and 20-hydroxysteroids
to varying extents. in vivo, these enzymes preferentially
function as reductases with the oxidation reaction being limited by low concentrations of the cofactor nadph [6].
 xxxg113xxx , also known as 20-hsd, exhibits significant
20-hydroxysteroid activity and has a major role in progesterone metabolism [7]. progesterone is essential for the
maintenance of pregnancy and its conversion to an inactive
progestin, 20- xxxd2303xxx , by  xxxg113xxx  is associ

ated with premature birth leading to infant morbidity and
mortality [8, 9]. increased activity of  xxxg113xxx  in the endometrium and in breast tissues leads to the formation of tumour promoting metabolites and to the development of
endometriosis as well as endometrial cancer and breast cancer [10-12].  xxxg113xxx  also plays an important role in brain
function where it modulates the occupancy of - xxxd2177xxx  type a (gaba a) receptors through its 3 and 20hsd activity [13].  xxxg113xxx  reduces neuroactive steroids
(3,5-tetrahydroprogesterone and 5-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone) and their precursors (5-dihydroprogesterone and
progesterone) to inactive 20-hydroxysteroids, thereby removing them from the synthetic pathway [14]. the elimination of the neuroactive steroids by  xxxg113xxx  is implicated in
symptoms of pre-menstrual syndrome (pms) and other neurological disorders [15]. therefore, it would be desirable to
identify selective and potent inhibitors for  xxxg113xxx  which
may help prevent excess metabolism of progesterone in case
of breast/endometrial cancer and maintain pregnancy or prevent miscarriage. in our efforts to discover new inhibitors of
 xxxg113xxx  using a virtual screening-based approach we identified  xxxd623xxx  as a potent inhibitor of  xxxg113xxx 
with an ic50 (concentration for 50% inhibition) in the submicromolar range. we also report for the first time the potential role of aspirin (acetyl  xxxd3159xxx ) and its metabolite
 xxxd3159xxx  in the counteraction of the adverse effects of
 xxxg113xxx  during pregnancy or pms.

molecules [17], was used to screen for small molecules that
might generate leads for potential inhibitors of  xxxg113xxx .
structures of the 250,000 compounds were downloaded without altering their ionization states using the program concord [18, 19]. instead of doing a blind screen for potential
inhibitors, a sub-library was created by adding physical and
chemical filters to remove unfavorable compounds. toxic
compounds containing heavy metals such as hg, pt, cr, pu,
al, au, ag, zn etc and compounds containing incorrectlyassigned rotable bonds that are associated with poor chemical stability were excluded from the search. the crystal
structure of  xxxg113xxx  complexed with 20- xxxd2303xxx  and nadp+ (pdb code:1mrq) was first obtained
from the rcsb protein database, after which the steroid
ligand and water molecules were removed. a molecular surface of the active site was generated and the docking of
ligands was restricted to this site. the structure-based screening program dock was used to screen for lead candidates
and determine their binding energies based on their complementarity and steric fit within the active site pocket [20, 21].
inhibitors of  xxxg113xxx 
the search using dock generated 29,250 compounds
ranked according to their energy scores. out of the top scoring compounds, only those that were commercially available
were visually examined in more detail using the modeling
program insightii (biosym technologies, san diego, ca,
usa). among these, compounds were selected based on the
number and type of interactions with the active site residues
and the coenzyme nadp+. out of these, compounds associated with poor solubility and permeability were excluded
from further analysis [22]. previous studies on the chemical
characteristics of inhibitors of  xxxg113xxx  have revealed that
the presence of carboxyl or hydroxyl groups or halogen atoms along with a bulky hydrophobic ring system is necessary for potent inhibition [23, 24]. based on these criteria, 16
candidate compounds were chosen for kinetic analysis.
out of the 16 compounds that were predicted to inhibit
 xxxg113xxx , based on the number and type of interactions with
the active site residues and the coenzyme nadp+, only seven
were active (table 1). the remaining 9 compounds were
either insoluble or failed to inhibit  xxxg113xxx  at 1 mm concentration and were therefore excluded from further analysis.
among the seven active compounds, anthraquinone-2carboxylic acid,  xxxd623xxx , 3,5-dinitro-p-toluic
acid and 3-phenyl-4,5-isoxazoledione-4-oxime showed potent inhibition with ic50 values of 24 m, 99 nm, 11 m
and 9.4 m, respectively. the ic50 values for 3,5-dinitro-4hydroxyphenyl acetic acid and n-benzyl-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide were not determined, because they exhibited 57% and
13% inhibition, respectively, at 1 mm concentration. although our studies predicted 4-benzoylpyridine as a potential
inhibitor of  xxxg113xxx , it was later found to have been previously described as a substrate of the reduction reaction catalyzed by  xxxg113xxx , and therefore its ic50 value was not determined [25].
out of the seven active compounds listed above, 3,5diiodosalicylic acid was the most potent competitive inhibitor of  xxxg113xxx  (fig. 1) with respect to the steroidal substrate 5-pregnane-3,20-diol with a ki value of 9 ± 1.2

nm. the ki value for  xxxd623xxx  is much smaller
than those for other steroid carboxylates and carboxylcontaining analogues of n-phenylanthranilic acid known to
inhibit akr1c isoenzymes [26], and comparable to those
for benzbromarone and 3’,3’’,5’,5’’-tetrabromophenolphthalein, which are the most potent inhibitors of  xxxg113xxx  known
to date [24].
previous crystallographic and molecular modeling studies of  xxxg113xxx  in complex with substrates, inhibitors and
coenzyme have helped identify residues within the active site
that are involved in ligand binding [27, 28]. the catalytic
tetrad, comprising residues tyr55, his117, asp50 and lys84
together with the cofactor nadp+ forms an oxyanion hole at
the bottom of the steroid-binding pocket, and is involved in
interactions with substrates and inhibitors. tyr24, leu54,
val128, ile129, his222, and trp227 are among the other
residues that line the steroid-binding pocket and are also
involved in hydrophobic or polar interactions with substrates
and inhibitors [29]. a previous report on  xxxg113xxx  inhibitors
has revealed that carboxylgroups of the steroid carboxylates
and n-phenylanthranilic acid derivatives are important requisites for inhibitor binding to the enzyme [26]. the acidic
hydroxyl group and the dibromophenol part of benzbromarone and 3’,3’’,5’,5’’-tetrabromophenolphthalein are additional structural requisites for potent inhibition of  xxxg113xxx 
[24].
docking simulations revealed that 3,5-diiodosalicylic
acid binds to the active site of  xxxg113xxx  with the carboxyl
group pointing towards the oxyanion hole. the iodine atom
at position 5 forms van der waals interaction with the side
chain of his117 (3.97å) and the carboxylate forms hydrogen
bonds with the hydroxyl group of tyr55 (3.02å) and the
ne2 of his222 (2.92å). the iodine atom at position 3 is
involved in van der waals interaction with the side chain of
trp227 (3.85å). the proposed interactions between 3,5diiodosalicylic acid and the active site residues are shown in
fig. (2).
interactions between the remaining inhibitors and  xxxg113xxx 
were also analyzed and provided useful insights on the type
of interactions between the different functional groups and
the residues of the active site. similar to the interactions described for other known inhibitors [26], the inhibitory activity of these compounds is due to their interactions with active siteresidues such as tyr24tyr55, his117, his222 and
trp227. most of these compounds either have a carboxyl or
a nitro group or both and a benzene ring, characteristics that
have been previously described as essential prerequisites for
potent inhibition of  xxxg113xxx  [24]. additional interactions of
these compounds include  stacking against the side chain of
trp227. 3,5-dinitro-p-toluic acid forms hydrogen bonds with
the ne2 of his117 (2.90 å), ne1 of trp227 (3.25 å) and
ne2 of his222 (2.98 å), and van der waals interaction with
the side chain of tyr55 (3.06 å). anthraquinone-2-carboxylic
acid forms hydrogen bonds with the ne2 of his222 (3.35 å)
and is present within van der waals contact with the side
chain of tyr24 (3.42 å). the benzene ring of 3,5-dinitro-4hydroxyphenyl acetic acid  stacks against the side chain of
trp227 (4.48 å) and the nitro groups form hydrogen bonds
with the ne1 of trp227 (3.30 å), ne2 of his117 (3.08 å)
and ne2 of his222 (3.34 å), and van der waals interaction

although the carboxyl group necessary for interaction
with the catalytic tyr55 is common to all three compounds,
aspirin and  xxxd3159xxx  are less potent inhibitors of  xxxg113xxx 
than  xxxd623xxx  (table 2). the loss of the iodine
atoms at positions 3 and 5 in  xxxd3159xxx  results in a 78fold loss in potency and in case of aspirin the acetylation of
the hydroxyl group of  xxxd3159xxx  further decreases the
inhibitory potency. these results emphasize the importance
of the van der waals interactions between the iodine atoms
at positions 3 and 5 and the side chains of residues his117
and trp227 in  xxxg113xxx .

conclusion
the use of virtual screening has identified a varied group
of inhibitors of the dehydrogenase activity of  xxxg113xxx . we
identified  xxxd623xxx  as a potent inhibitor of
 xxxg113xxx  with an ic50 value in the sub-micromolar range. a
crystal structure of  xxxd623xxx  bound in the active site of  xxxg113xxx  would enhance our understanding of the
mode of interaction and help identify any changes in the enzyme’s tertiary structure that may be associated with inhibitor binding. although  xxxd623xxx  was the most
potent inhibitor of  xxxg113xxx , the inhibitory effects of aspirin
cannot be disregarded due to its wide spread use as a therapeutic agent for a host of conditions varying from headaches
to prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer [30]. despite the fact that aspirin is less potent compared to other
known inhibitors of  xxxg113xxx , it is inexpensive, relatively
safe and easily available over the counter. inhibitors identified in this study may aid the development of new drugs for
the treatment of cancer, maintain pregnancy or prevent miscarriage.

were dissolved in methanol with the final concentration of
methanol not exceeding 2% of the total volume of the reaction mixture. initially, all 16 compounds were tested to determine their inhibitory effect at 1 mm concentration and
ic50 values were determined only for compounds that exhibited more than 50% inhibition at 1 mm concentration. the
final concentrations of nadp+, s-tetralol and inhibitor in the
reaction mixture were 2.5 mm, 2.5 mm and 1 mm, respectively. the reaction was commenced upon addition of appro-

determined by measuring the rate of change of nadph fluorescence at 455 nm with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm

lineweaver-burke plot with 5-pregnane-3,20-diol as the
substrate. one unit of enzyme activity was defined as the
amount that catalyses the formation of 1 mol of nadph
per minute at 25 °c. all reported values are the means or
