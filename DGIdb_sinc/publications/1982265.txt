the effects of 3,4- xxxd2611xxx 
(mdma) on monoamine release were investigated in superfused slices of rat striatum and hippocampus. mdma (10 pm) increased the resting release of radioactivity from slices
incubated in [‘h]dopamine, [‘his-hydroxytryptamine
or [ 3h]noradrenaline. these effects of mdma (10 pm) were
blocked by the neuronal ‘uptake inhibitors, cocaine (10 pm), fluoxetine (1 pm) and desmethylimipramine
(1 pm),
respectively. mdma (10 pm) enhanced the stimulation-induced
efflux of radioactivity from slices incubated in
[ 3h]noradrenaline but not from slices incubated in [3h]5-hydroxytryptamine
or [3h]dopamine. these results demonstrate for the first time a direct noradrenaline-releasing
action of mdma and differential effects of mdma on the
stimulation-induced release of noradrenaline, dopamine and s-hydroxytryptamine from rat superfused brain slices.

(mdma)
(johnson et

et al.,
1982; johnson et al., 1986; schmidt et al., 1987;
hekmatpanah and peroutka, 1990), and to block
the neuronal uptake of monoamines in the brain
(steele et al., 1987). the monoamine-releasing effects of mdma can be blocked with neuronal
uptake blockers (schmidt et al., 1987; hekmatpanah and peroutka, 1990).
while mdma-induced dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine release has been investigated,
there are no reports either on the effects of mdma

on noradrenaline release or on the effects of
mdma on the electrical stimulation-induced (s-1)
release of noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine and
dopamine. this study compares the effects of
mdma on the resting and s-i release of the three
monoamines from rat brain slices.

2. materials and methods
female sprague-dawley rats (250-300 g) were
decapitated and 500 gm coronal slices of hippocampus and striatum were obtained. slices were
equilibrated for 30 min in physiological salt solution of the following composition (mm): nacl
118.0, kc1 4.7, cac12 2.5, nahco, 25.0, kh,po,
1.03, mgso, 0.45, d-glucose 11.1,  xxxd228xxx 
0.14, na,edta 0.067. slices were then incubated
in physiological salt solution containing either 0.1
fm [3h]dopamine (5.4 @x/ml), 0.1 pm [3h]5hydroxytryptamine
(4.4 pci/ml),
or 0.2 fm

~~~~ora~~n~ine (2.5 pci/ml) for 30 min. following incubation. slices were rinsed three times
with 2 ml physiolo8&l salt solution. then transsingly to glass su~rfusion chambers (i ml
fe
internai volume) where they were held by nylon
mesh between two platinum plate electrodes, and
superfused at 33°c at a rate of 1 ml/mm.
a priming stimulation (5 hz, 1 rain) was delivered 45 min after the commencement of superfusion. slices were subjected to two further periods of electrical stim~ation (s, and !!q 90 and
132 min after the commencement of superfusion.
stimulation at 8 v/cm consisted of square wave
pulses of 2 ms duration at a frequency of 5 hz for
lmin.
the superfusate was collected in 3-min fractions starting 6 min prior to s, and continuing for
15 min after &. mdma was introduced 21 min
prior to s, and where indicated fluoxetine, cocaine
or desmethylimipramine
(dmi) was present
throughout superfusion. at the end of superfusion, slices were deproteinat~ in 0.2 m hclo, for
12 h, sonicated and tissue radioactivity determined.
the efflwr of radioactivity was expressed as a
percentage of the tissue radioactive content at the
time of fraction collection. the resting efflux of
radioactivity preceding each period of electrical
sedation
was taken as the mean of the fractional release of radioactivity in the two 3-min
periods prior to stimulation. the s-i outflow of
radioactivity (fr) was calculated as the difference
between five times the resting outflow of radioactivity and the sum of the fractional release of
radioactivity in the five 3-min periods from the
start of stimulation. the s-i efflux of radioactivity, taken as an index of transmitter release, was
calculated as the ratio of s-i outflow evoked by s,
to that evoked by st (fr,/fr,).
results are expressed as means and se., and n
indicates the number of animals tested.
the drugs used in this study were: cocaine
hydrochloride ~macf~l~e-seth,
australia), desmethy~ipr~ne
hydrochloride
(ciba-geigy,
u.k.), fluoxetine hydrochloride (lilly, u.s.a.) and
( -.f)_3,4methylenedioxymethamphetamine
hydrochloride (maker, israel). ra~olabebed monoamines were obtained from amersham (u.k.}.

3. results
3.1. mdma-induced release of radioactivity
mdma (10 fm) caused an increase in the
fractional release of radioactivity from striatal
slices incubated in [3h]dopamine and from hippocampal slices incubated in [ 3h]5-hydroxytryptamine or j3h]noradrenaline (fig. 1). to determine the mdma-induced change in resting
efflux of radioacti~ty, the resting efflux of radioactivity just prior to s, was expressed as a percentage of the resting efflux of radioactivity prior
to st (rjr,).
mdma (10 pm) increased the
resting efflux of radioactivity to the same extent
from slices incubated in [3h]dopamine, [3h]s-hydroxytryptamine or [ 3h]noradrenaline, enhancing
r,/r, from 88.8 + 4.3% (n = 4) to 340.5 it: 71.8%
(n = 3), from 80.3 f 2.4% (n = 4) to 348.1 f 45.9%
(n = 4) and from 79.6 j, 3.1% (n = 4) to 312.6 =
57% (n = 5), respectively.
blockers of the neuronal uptake of dopamine
(cocaine, 10 pm), 5-hydroxytryptamine (fluoxetine, 1 fm) and noradrenaline (dmi, 1 fm),
abolished the md~-induct
increases in resting
fractional release of radioactivity (fig. 1).
3.2. effect of mdma on the s-i effrux of radioaciivilly

electrical stimulation of slices incubated in each
of the three monoamines caused an outflow of
radioactivity (fig. 1). mdma (10 fm) had no
effect on the s-i efflux of radioactivity (fr2/fr,)
from slices incubated in [3h]5-hydroxytryptamine.
similarly, mdma did not appear to affect the s-i
efflux of radioactivity from slices incubated in
[3h]dopamine, although in this case a stable resting outflow of radioactivity prior to s, was not
clearly established. in contrast, the s-i efflux of
radioactivity (frjfr,)
from slices incubated in
[3h]noradrenaline was markedly enhanced in the
presence of 10 pm mdma from a control value
of 0.785 f 0.021 (n = 4) to 5.898 + 0.856 (n = 5).
this enhancement was blocked by 1 pm dmi.
when present throughout superfusion, fluoxetine (1 pm), cocaine (10 pm) or dmi (1 fm) had
no effect on s-i efflux (frjfr,),

4. discussion
in this study, it has been demonstrated for the
first time that mdma directly causes the release
of radioactivity from rat hippocampal slices in
cubated in [3h]noradrenaline. it was also shown
that mdma causes the release of radioactivity
from brain slices incubated in either [3h]dopamine or [3h]5-hydroxytryptamine, in agreement
with previous reports (nichols et al., 1982; johnson et al., 1986; schmidt et ai., 1987; hekmatpanah and peroutka, 1990). in brain slice superfusion systems, resting radioactive efflux is comprised mainly of radioactive metabolites (herdon
et al., 1985). however, the mdma-induced increase in resting radioactive efflux in the present
study is likely to consist of predominantly monoamine transmitter, since herdon et al. (1985) have
demonstrated that amphetamine-induced release
from rat striatal slices consists of mainly transmitter with very little deaminated metabolite.
mdma markedly enhanced the s-i release of
radioactivity from slices incubated in [3h]noradrenaline. in contrast, mdma had no effect on the
s-i efflux of radioactivity (frjfr,)
from slices
incubated in [.3h]dopamine or [ 3h]5-hydroxytryptamine, although resting release (r2/ri) was
enhanced to a sirnular extent from slices incubated
in [ 3h]dopamine, [ 3h]5-hydroxytryptamine and
[ 3h]noradrenaline. this suggests that the differential effects of mdma on the s-i release of transmitter are not due to differential effects on resting
efflux.
the actions of mdma were blocked by neuro-

nal uptake blockers, as previously reported
(hekmatpanah and peroutka, 1990; schmidt et
al., 1987), suggesting that the neuronal uptake
carrier is critical in the acute monoamine-releasing
actions of mdma.
behavioural effects caused by mdma, such as
enhanced locomoter activity (gold and koob,
1988) and lowering of brain stimulation reward
thresholds (hubner et al., 1988), are considered to
be mediated primarily by alterations in dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. noradrenaline is also thought to be involved in these
bchaviours (homykiewicz, 1982). since the results
of the present study have shown that mdma has

effects on nuxadrenergic neurotransmission, a role
e should perhaps be considered in
effects of ~~~.
