abstract
the present study demonstrates a possible mechanism for the
improvement of gastrointestinal cancer patients’ prognosis by
the histamine receptor type 2 ( xxxg1079xxx ) antagonist cimetidine. this
agent, but not the  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists ranitidine and  xxxd2082xxx ,
induced the production of an antitumor cytokine, interleukin
(il)-18, by human monocytes and dendritic cells (dc). in fact,
ranitidine and  xxxd2082xxx  antagonized cimetidine-induced il-18
production. cimetidine induced the activation of  xxxg340xxx ,
which is reported to modify immature il-18 to mature/active

postoperative administration of cimetidine improves survival in patients with gastrointestinal cancer (tonnesen et
al., 1988). this action may be due to a direct inhibitory effect
on tumor growth (adams and morris, 1994), cell-mediated
immunomodulation (hellstrand and hermodsson, 1986; gifford and tirberg, 1987), or inhibition of cancer cell metastases (tomita et al., 2003). the cell-mediated immunomodulation includes inhibition of suppressor t cells (hellstrand and
hermodsson, 1986), stimulation of natural killer cells, and
increase in il-2 production in t cells (gifford and tirberg,
1987). the increase of histamine release is reported to represent the underlying cause for immunosuppression observed at the time of colonic resection; such an effect exerted

il-18, and the elevation of intracellular camp, leading to the
activation of  xxxg1836xxx  (pka). the pka inhibitor  xxxd477xxx 
abolished the il-18 production induced by cimetidine. moreover, the effects of cimetidine on il-18 production were reproduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from wild-type
mice, but not in those from  xxxg1079xxx  knockout mice. in conclusion,
cimetidine, a partial agonist for  xxxg1079xxx , has a pharmacological
profile different from ranitidine and  xxxd2082xxx , possibly contributing to its antitumor activity on gastrointestinal cancers.

by histamine can be prevented by perioperative cimetidine (adams and morris, 1994). however, such beneficial effects using
other  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists (i.e.,  xxxd2082xxx  and ranitidine), have
not been observed in clinical trials (matsumoto, 1995). cimetidine treatment inhibits histamine-initiated angiogenesis via
reducing  xxxg2413xxx  expression (gifford
and tirberg, 1987). the activation state of intratumoral dc is a
critical factor in the host response to tumors (furumoto et al.,
2004). cimetidine-induced higher antigen presenting capacity
of dc was observed in patients with advanced cancer compared
with healthy control subjects (kubota et al., 2002).
il-18, a monocyte-derived cytokine that requires cleavage
with  xxxg340xxx  for activity (gu et al., 1997), enhances local
antitumor immune responses through activating natural killer
cells and t cells (kohno et al., 1997). il-18 inhibits angiogenesis
(coughlin et al., 1998) and induces apoptosis in tumor cells
(hashimoto et al., 1999). in the mouse colon cancer model, il-18
inhibits growth of cells (tamura et al., 2003), and successful
prevention of colon cancer establishment is associated with
elevation of serum il-18 level (goto et al., 2002).

cimetidine induces il-18 production

in the present study, cimetidine behaved as a partial agonist for  xxxg1079xxx  in inducing il-18 production in monocytes and
dc derived from pbmc.

materials and methods

assay of camp. after a 30-min incubation, monocytes at 2 ⫻ 105
cells/200 ␮l/well were supplemented and assayed for camp using an
enzyme immunoassay kit (cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi), consistent with the previous report (kubo et al., 2004). we performed no
acetylation procedures.
statistical examination. the statistical significance of differences was evaluated by analysis of variance followed by dunnett’s
test. the results are presented as the means ⫾ s.e.m. of triplicate
findings from five donors. a probability value (p) less than 0.05 was
considered significant.

results and discussion
as shown in fig. 1a, the effects of histamine and cimetidine at concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 1 mm on il-18
production were determined in human pbmc. histamine
concentration-dependently induced the il-18 production,
and the effect of histamine was maximal at the concentration
of 100 ␮m. using the same preparation, cimetidine concentration-dependently induced the il-18 production exhibiting
35% agonist activity compared with histamine. cimetidine
also induced the production of il-18 in monocytes and dc as
well as  xxxg340xxx  activation in monocytes (fig. 1, b and d). a
 xxxg340xxx  inhibitor, z-yvad-fmk, prevented this cimetidine-initiated il-18 production (fig. 1e), suggesting that
 xxxg340xxx  activation might be involved in the effect of cimetidine. the level of il-18 production in monocytes and dc
induced by cimetidine at 100 ␮m was one third of that seen
with histamine at 100 ␮m. the effect of histamine on il-18
production was reported to be mediated solely by  xxxg1079xxx  stimulation (kohka et al., 2000). the concentration range of cimetidine has been used for assessing the  xxxg1079xxx  antagonistic
activity of cimetidine on different tissue preparations including stomach and atrium. other  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists (i.e.,  xxxd2082xxx  and ranitidine) had no effect on the production of il-18
(fig. 1b). cimetidine at 100 ␮m induced the production of
il-18 in the presence of histamine at 0.01 ␮m; however, the
same concentration of cimetidine inhibited the production of
il-18 induced by histamine at 1 and 100 ␮m (fig. 1c).
therefore, cimetidine may act as a partial agonist in the

reagents and drugs. recombinant human il-18 and n-benzyloxycarbonyl-tyr-val-ala-asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-yvad-fmk)
were purchased from mbl (nagoya, japan). histamine dihydrochloride and cimetidine were purchased from nakalai tesque, inc.
(kyoto, japan) and sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). ranitidine
and  xxxd2082xxx  were provided by glaxo japan (tokyo, japan) and
yamanouchi pharmaceutical co. ltd. (tokyo, japan).  xxxd477xxx  was purchased from calbiochem (darmstadt, germany).
preparation of human and murine cells. normal human
pbmc were obtained from peripheral blood of 10 volunteers after
acquiring institutional review board approval (okayama university;
irb 279) as described previously (kohka et al., 2000). separation of
monocytes from pbmc was carried out as described previously (takahashi et al., 2003). the purity of monocytes was 85% as determined by flow cytometry with anti-cd14 antibody. dc were prepared from pbmc as described previously (kubo et al., 2004). the
resultant dc showed  xxxg376xxx (⫹)cd14(⫺)hla-dr(⫹) xxxg397xxx (⫺) phenotype, consistent with the previous report (kubo et al., 2004). pbmc
and spleen cells were obtained from five wild-type or  xxxg1079xxx  knockout
mice as described previously (yokoyama et al., 2004). we abided by
the guidelines on animal experimentation of okayama university
graduate school of medicine and dentistry, and the institutional
animal experimentation review committee licensed all procedures.
cytokine assays. il-18 in cell-free supernatants was measured
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (for human and mouse
il-18; mbl) as described previously (kohka et al., 2000; takahashi
et al., 2003). the detection limit of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 10 pg/ml.
activity of  xxxg340xxx . the activity of  xxxg340xxx  was determined
in a colorimetric assay with a substrate (wehd-pna) specific for
this enzyme (r&d systems, inc., minneapolis, mn). after 1-h incubation, monocytes were pelleted by centrifuging (1000g; 4°c, 5 min),
the supernatant was aspirated, and the cells were lysed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. cell lysate and the
initial supernatant were analyzed for the activity of cell-bound and
released  xxxg340xxx , respectively.

takahashi et al.

presence of histamine at 0.01 ␮m, whereas it may act as an
antagonist in the presence of histamine at 1 and 100 ␮m. the
amount of histamine in the conditioned media of monocytes
treated with cimetidine was the same as control cells without
cimetidine. moreover, histamine at the concentration present
in such conditioned media did not have any effect on cytokine
production. these results indicate that the effect of cimetidine was not mediated via antagonism of histamine action on
 xxxg1079xxx  and that cimetidine may behave as an agonist when the
concentration of histamine is low. this finding prompted us
to test whether cimetidine exerted its effect by acting as an
agonist for  xxxg1079xxx  stimulation.
the  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists  xxxd2082xxx  and ranitidine antagonized the effect of cimetidine on il-18 production in monocytes (fig. 2, a and b). the maximal inhibitory effect of both
 xxxd2082xxx  and ranitidine was 70%.  xxxg1079xxx  stimulation is
known to induce intracellular activation of camp/pka pathway (shayo et al., 1997; van der pouw kraan et al., 1998).
cimetidine as well as histamine induced the elevation of
camp (fig. 2c); however,  xxxd2082xxx  and ranitidine had no
effect (data not shown). the maximal effect of cimetidine on
camp elevation was one third of that obtained by histamine.
as shown in fig. 2d, the pka inhibitor  xxxd477xxx  partially inhibited the cimetidine- and histamine-induced il-18 production
by 56 and 58%, respectively. these results suggested that the
camp/pka pathway is partially involved in the action of
cimetidine. in addition, we examined the effect of cimetidine
and histamine on the production of il-18 by spleen cells and
pbmc from  xxxg1079xxx  knockout mice (fig. 2, e and f). cimetidine
and histamine induced the production of il-18 by the cells
from wild-type mice but not from  xxxg1079xxx  knockout mice. taken
together, the present findings indicate that cimetidine stimulated  xxxg1079xxx  as a partial agonist. burimamide is reported to

be a partial  xxxg1079xxx  agonist at the recombinant human  xxxg1079xxx 
(alewijnse et al., 1998); however, burimamide had no effect
on the production of il-18 by human monocytes (fig. 1b). on
the other hand, cimetidine was classified as an  xxxd1422xxx  using the recombinant human  xxxg1079xxx  transfected into chinese hamster ovary cells (alewijnse et al., 1998). thus, the
pharmacological profile of  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists may differ depending on the receptor expression cells.
in conclusion, cimetidine induces the production of il-18 in
monocytes via  xxxg1079xxx , and this may provide insights into mechanism underlying the improvement of the prognoses of patients with colon cancer as a result of cimetidine treatment.
