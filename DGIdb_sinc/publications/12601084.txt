common molecular determinants of  xxxd2113xxx  and lidocaine block of
heart na channels: evidence from experiments with neutral and
quaternary  xxxd2113xxx  analogues
huajun liu, joshua atkins, and robert s. kass

a b s t r a c t  xxxd2113xxx  (pka 9.3, 99% charged at ph 7.4) and lidocaine (pka 7.6–8.0, 50% neutral at ph 7.4)
have similar structures but markedly different effects on na channel activity. both drugs cause well-characterized
use-dependent block (udb) of na channels due to stabilization of the inactivated state, but  xxxd2113xxx  requires
that channels first open before block develops, whereas lidocaine is believed to bind directly to the inactivated
state. to test whether the charge on  xxxd2113xxx  might determine its state specificity of na channel blockade, we
developed two  xxxd2113xxx  analogues, nu-fl (pka 6.4), that is 90% neutral at ph 7.4, and a quaternary  xxxd2113xxx 
analogue, qx-fl, that is fully charged at physiological ph. we examined the effects of  xxxd2113xxx , nu-fl, qx-fl,
and lidocaine on human cardiac na channels expressed in human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells. at physiological ph, nu-fl, like lidocaine but not  xxxd2113xxx , interacts preferentially with inactivated channels without prerequisite channel opening, and causes minimal udb. we find that udb develops predominantly by the charged
form of  xxxd2113xxx  as evidenced by investigation of qx-fl at physiological ph and nu-fl investigated over a more
acidic ph range where its charged fraction is increased. qx-fl is a potent blocker of channels when applied from
inside the cell, but acts very weakly with external application. udb by qx-fl, like  xxxd2113xxx , develops only after
channels open. once blocked, channels recover very slowly from qx-fl block, apparently without requisite channel opening. our data strongly suggest that it is the difference in degree of ionization (pka) between lidocaine
and  xxxd2113xxx , rather than gross structural features, that determines distinction in block of cardiac na channels.
the data also suggest that the two drugs share a common receptor but, consistent with the modulated receptor hypothesis, reach this receptor by distinct routes dictated by the degree of ionization of the drug molecules.

investigation of ion channel defects associated with the
long qt syndrome (lqts)* has provided new insights
into fundamental mechanisms through which ion
channel activity and its modulation by drugs control
the duration of the cardiac ventricular action potential
and consequently the qt interval of the electrocardiogram (ekg). in particular, the unanticipated discovery
of mutations in  xxxg2028xxx , the gene coding for the  subunit of the heart voltage–gated na channel, associated
with lqts variant 3 ( xxxg1268xxx -3) and the use of na channel blockers to control qt prolongation in  xxxg1268xxx -3 mutation carriers has renewed interest into the fundamental mechanism of actions of drugs that block na channels (an et al., 1996; dumaine and kirsch, 1998;
kambouris et al., 2000; viswanathan et al., 2001).

 xxxd2113xxx , the prototypical class 1c antiarrhythmic
agent, is of particular interest because it has been
shown to be more effective than lidocaine, a prototypical class 1b agent, in the management of qt prolongation in some  xxxg1268xxx -3 mutation carriers (brugada et al.,
1999; benhorin et al., 2000). additionally,  xxxd2113xxx 
is used in diagnostic tests to identify patients at risk
for the brugada syndrome, an inherited form of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation that too is associated with
 xxxg2028xxx  mutation (brugada et al., 1999). clearly, understanding fundamental differences between the mechanisms of action of  xxxd2113xxx  and lidocaine has significance, not only from the point of view of the fundamental molecular pharmacology of the cardiac na
channel, but also for its importance in detecting and
treating these inherited arrhythmias.
 xxxd2113xxx  and lidocaine have similar chemical structures but markedly different effects on sodium channel
activity. both drugs promote tonic and use channel
state–dependent block (block that increases with channel activity) of na channels. the affinity of lidocaine
is higher for inactivated compared with resting channels, and hence the stabilization of inactivated lidocaine-bound channels has been shown to underlie its

udb of channels by internally, but not externally, applied qx-fl, with voltage and time-dependent characteristics consistent with intracellular access to a common receptor for local anesthetic molecules. qx-fl
block requires the open conformation of the channel,
suggesting that channel openings unmask a preferred
intracellular access route allowing qx-fl to bind to the
la receptor site in the inner mouth of the channel
pore. further, because the slow recovery of channels
from qx-fl block was impeded by outer pore block by
tetrodotoxin, our data also suggest that drug can diffuse away from channels via the outer pore even in the
absence transitions into the open state. our data
strongly suggest that it is the difference in degree of
ionization (pka) between lidocaine and  xxxd2113xxx ,
rather than differences in their gross structural features, that determines distinction in block of cardiac
na channels. the data also suggest that the two drugs
share a common receptor, but, as outlined in the modulated receptor hypothesis, reach this receptor by distinct routes.

state-dependent na channel block (hille, 1977a). in
contrast with lidocaine,  xxxd2113xxx  requires channels to
open before it causes use-dependent block (udb) and
consequently has been associated with block of open
channels (anno and hondeghem, 1990; ragsdale et
al., 1996; liu et al., 2002). however, investigation of disease-associated mutant cardiac na channels recently
has provided evidence that although necessary, channel openings are not sufficient to explain  xxxd2113xxx 
udb. instead, like lidocaine,  xxxd2113xxx  block may be
determined by preferential interaction with inactivated
channels (liu et al., 2002). further, the results of that
study suggested that differential access to a common receptor might account for differences between these
two drugs.
investigation into differential access to a common receptor has been hampered by differences in the physical chemical properties of the two drugs. lidocaine has
a pka between 7.8–8.6 and thus may be up to 50% neutral at physiological ph. in contrast,  xxxd2113xxx  has a
pka of 9.3, resulting in 99% of the drug in ionized
and 1% in neutral forms at ph 7.4 (hille, 1977a; strichartz et al., 1990). thus, the charge on  xxxd2113xxx  is
likely to restrict access of the drug to a receptor site,
confer the dependence of use-dependent block on
channel openings, and account for most of the differences between it and lidocaine (strichartz, 1973; hille,
1977a; chernoff and strichartz, 1990). however, a direct test of this possibility has not been possible because
of the marked differences in distribution between neutral and charged forms of each compound.
here we employed two custom-synthesized  xxxd2113xxx 
analogues, nu-fl and qx-fl, to investigate the molecular determinants of  xxxd2113xxx  activity. nu-fl has
nearly identical hyrophobicity and very similar threedimensional structure compared with  xxxd2113xxx , but has
a very different pka. as measured by titration, nu-fl
has an approximate pka value of 6.4. consequently, it
should be nearly 90% neutral at physiological ph, thus
more closely resembling the ionization profile of lidocaine. qx-fl shares a very similar three-dimensional
structure with the parent compound  xxxd2113xxx , but is
fully charged at physiological ph, and thus is well
suited to discriminate between hydrophilic and hydrophobic access to its receptor. we compared the effects
of  xxxd2113xxx , nu-fl, qx-fl, and lidocaine on human
heart ( xxxg2028xxx ) sodium channels expressed in human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells to better understand
the specific mechanism of block by  xxxd2113xxx . our results indicate that like lidocaine, the tertiary  xxxd2113xxx 
analogue (nu-fl) interacts preferentially with inactivated channels without prerequisite channel openings,
while  xxxd2113xxx  (and qx-fl) is ineffective in blocking
channels that inactivate without first opening. ionized

mutations of  xxxg2028xxx  were engineered into wt cdna cloned in
pcdna3.1 (invitrogen) by overlap extension using mutation-specific primers and quick change site-directed mutagenesis kit
(stratagene) as described previously (abriel et al., 2001). the
presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis.
wt and mutant na channels were expressed in hek293 cells as
described previously (abriel et al., 2001). transient transfections
were performed with equal amounts of na channel  subunit
and with h 1, subcloned individually into the pcdna3.1 (invitrogen) vector (total cdna 2.5 g) using a previously described lipofection procedure (abriel et al., 2001). expression of channels
was studied using patch clamp procedures 48 h after transfection.

pettes were coated with sylgard (dow chemical co.) to decrease
noise and capacitance of the glass, and electrode resistance was
typically 1–2 m when filled with internal solution containing
110 mm nacl, 10 mm hepes (ph adjusted to 7.4).
in experiments designed to measure the voltage dependence
of activation, external na was reduced to 30 mm using n-methylglucamine as an na substitute. activation curves were determined by normalization of peak current versus voltage to driving
force determined as the difference between test voltage and measured channel reversal potential in low external na . steady-state
inactivation was measured with 5-s conditioning pulses followed
by a test pulse (10 mv), with an interpulse interval of 10 s.
steady-state udb was reached in response to trains of variable
numbers of pulses (100–600 , 10 mv), at frequencies indicated in the figure legends. this was sufficiently long to induce
steady-state udb for each construct. udb was measured as the
ratio of peak current at 10 mv after and before application of a
conditioning train and is reported as the percentage block of
peak current.

1975). to the best of our knowledge these are novel
 xxxd2113xxx  analogues. fig. 1 compares the structures of
nu-fl, qx-fl, and  xxxd2113xxx  and illustrates the relative distributions of neutral and charged drug forms as
a function of solution ph. the experimentally determined pka of nu-fl was 6.4. thus, at physiologic ph
(7.4), 90% of the drug is neutral. altering the ph of
drug-containing solutions alters the ionized fraction of
nu-fl. at ph 8.4, the drug is 99% neutral, whereas at
ph 5.4 it is 90% charged. in contrast, because the pka
of  xxxd2113xxx  is 9.3, it remains 98% charged over this
ph range, and qx-fl is fully ionized over this ph
range.
we initially focused on the actions of nu-fl to determine whether neutral or charged drug forms caused
udb. fig. 2, a and b, shows that at similar concentrations and using similar voltage protocols, much less
udb develops in the presence of nu-fl than  xxxd2113xxx . apparently at the pulse frequency of these experiments (10 hz) the interpulse interval (75 ms) during
the pulse train is sufficiently long to allow for unblock
of most nu-fl bound channels. increasing the nu-fl
concentration to 100 m such that the estimated concentration of ionized nu-fl is 10 m results in udb
202

comparable to that caused by 10 m  xxxd2113xxx . because only 10% of nu-fl is charged at physiological
ph, this result suggests that the block that builds with
repetitive depolarization to voltages that open channels
(udb) develops predominantly by the charged forms
of both  xxxd2113xxx  and nu-fl. this might be the case if
both charged and neutral drug forms gain access to a
common receptor during the brief depolarizing pulses,
but that, upon return to 100 mv, channels can recover quickly from neutral drug block, but not from
block by ionized drugs. if this were the case, then increasing the ratio of charged to neutral drug molecules, while keeping total drug concentration constant,
should increase the development of udb with this voltage protocol. the data in fig. 2 c indicate that this is
indeed the case. as summarized in the figure, as extracellular ph is lowered and the fraction of ionized nufl increased, udb also increases despite the fact that
total nu-fl concentration is constant.
as proposed above, the difference in udb that develops for nu-fl and  xxxd2113xxx  at ph 7.4 may be due in
large part to the difference between the kinetics of the
recovery from block by neutral and charged drug
forms. recovery from drug block by both nu-fl and

(10 mv, 25 ms) from a holding potential of 100 mv at a frequency of 10 hz. pulses were applied until steady-state udb was achieved.
this pulse protocol allows for a 75-ms interpulse interval at the holding potential between conditioning pulses. (a) examples of current

 xxxd2113xxx  at physiological ph is illustrated in fig. 3.
exponential fits to the recovery kinetic data revealed
the following recovery time constants (1(fast) and 2
(slow)): 55 ms and 508 ms for nu-fl, 103 ms and 2,530
ms for  xxxd2113xxx . recovery is significantly faster for
nu-fl than for  xxxd2113xxx . because nu-fl is 90% neutral at ph 7.4, the most likely difference in the recovery
kinetics is due to rapid unblock of neutral drug-bound
channels and very slow unblock of charged drug-bound
channels.
recovery from nu-fl block in solutions buffered to
ph 5.5, when the ratio of neutral to charged forms of
nu-fl are reversed, is greatly slowed, consistent with
this hypothesis. finally, we also illustrate recovery from
channel block by the permanently charged analogue
qx-fl in panel a, which is remarkably similar to recovery from  xxxd2113xxx  block. at ph 7.4 there are both
neutral and ionized forms of  xxxd2113xxx  and nu-fl,
and thus the time course of recovery from block for
these drugs are complex. as proposed by hille and colleagues in the analysis of the ph dependence of usedependent block of na channels in muscle and nerve
(hille, 1977a,b; schwarz et al., 1977), during interpulse
intervals bound charged drug is trapped within the
203

liu et al.

channel until the drug molecule is deprotonated. neutral drug, which is less restricted (hille, 1977a), can dissociate from the channel at these voltages between conditioning pulses. at ph 5.5 (fig. 3 b), when 90% of
nu-fl molecules are ionized, the recovery from inactivation closely resembles that of  xxxd2113xxx  at ph 7.4
(fig. 3 a), suggesting similar kinetics when both drugs
are ionized. at physiological ph, the fact that the recovery from block is faster for nu-fl than for  xxxd2113xxx 
may simply be due to the greater contribution (90%) of
drug block by the neutral nu-fl component compared, while  xxxd2113xxx  remains 99% charged. on the
other hand, according the scheme described above, it
is possible that deprotonation of nu-fl, which can occur when channels are closed and at rest (schwarz et
al., 1977), may occur faster than deprotonation of
flecainde, and that the differences in recovery kinetics
occur not only because of the greater fraction of neutral nu-fl molecules at this ph, but also because the
ionized bound drug deprotonates faster than ionized
bound flecainde leave the vicinity of the receptor via a
hydrophobic pathway. our data thus indicate that udb
develops predominantly as a function of differences
between the recovery kinetics of ionized and neutral

drug molecules. this profile closely resembles that of
lidocaine, raising the question as to whether or not the
molecular pharmacology of lidocaine and nu-fl, including channel state dependence of block, share similar profiles.
channel openings are required for block by charged, but not
neutral,  xxxd2113xxx 
udb by  xxxd2113xxx  requires that channels first open before block develops (ragsdale et al., 1996; liu et al.,
2002). if this dependence on channel openings is due
to restricted receptor access caused by the predominantly ionized form of the drug, this requirement
should be reduced or eliminated for nu-fl, a greater
fraction of which is neutral at ph 7.4. fig. 4 shows that
this is in fact the case. shown in the figure are currents
measured at a fixed voltage, but after trains of conditioning pulses have been applied to a series of voltages.
reduction in current measured during the test pulse is
a reflection of block that develops in a use-dependent
manner during the conditioning pulse trains (ragsdale
et al., 1994, 1996). as has been shown previously by us
(liu et al., 2002),  xxxd2113xxx  block develops during the
conditioning train, but only after pulses are applied to
voltages more positive than 45 mv, a voltage near the
activation threshold for na channels. a similar profile
emerged for the voltage dependence of channel block
204

by qx-fl (filled circles), indicating that channel openings are a common prerequisite for qx-fl and  xxxd2113xxx  na channel block. this suggests that the open
state conformation is necessary for the ionized form of
the drug to reach its receptor. in contrast with the experiments illustrated in fig. 2, the pulse frequency (25
hz) in these experiments, which allows only a 15-ms interpulse interval between conditioning pulses, was sufficiently fast to promote channel block by nu-fl during
the conditioning trains. udb by nu-fl is apparent after conditioning voltages as negative as 80 mv, voltages consistent with a decrease in channel availability
that is not dependent on channel openings.
the data of fig. 4 suggest a preferential interaction
of neutral  xxxd2113xxx  (nu-fl) with inactivated channels
that does not require channel openings to develop, a
suggestion that predicts drug-dependent alteration of
the voltage dependence of channel availability. thus,
we compared the effects of nu-fl with lidocaine and
 xxxd2113xxx  on the voltage dependence of channel availability in the absence of trains of conditioning pulses to
first open channels. under these conditions, as previously shown (liu et al., 2002),  xxxd2113xxx  has little effect
on channel availability (fig. 5 a). in contrast, lidocaine
(fig. 5 b) causes a well-documented negative shift in
channel availability under the same voltage conditions.

conditioning pulses, similar to lidocaine but in contrast
to  xxxd2113xxx  (fig. 5 c). thus, although nearly identical
to  xxxd2113xxx  in structure, nu-fl interacts with the inactivated state without mandatory channel openings
similar to lidocaine, a drug with a significant neutral
component at physiological ph. when similar experiments are carried at ph 8.0, solutions for which a
greater fraction of nu-fl is neutral, a lower total nufl concentration causes a similar shift in channel availability, providing additional evidence that it is the neutral form of nu-fl that interacts with the inactivated
channel in these experiments (unpublished data).
nu-fl: high-affinity block of inactivated channels

has a higher affinity for the inactivated rather than the
resting state and illustrate the results of these experiments in fig. 6. a voltage protocol was used to inacti205

to 10 mv, preceded by a 3-ms return to the negative
(100 mv) holding potential to allow drug-free, but
not drug-bound, channels to recover from inactivation
was applied to assay available channels. the concentration dependence of the block of channels during this
test pulse with and without conditioning pulses provides an estimate of rested state (no conditioning
pulse) and inactivated state (with conditioning pulse)
channel block (weiser et al., 1999). concentrationresponse curves obtained using this protocol showed
that the neutral analogue inhibited na channels after
conditioning pulses (inactivated state block) with an
0.51 m, which is comparable to
ec50 value of 5.32
that obtained for lidocaine (3.46 0.33 m) using the
same voltage protocol. rested state block (no prepulse)
revealed an ec50 values of 794 39 m (nu-fl) and

suggest that a simple change in the hydrophobicity
(charge) of  xxxd2113xxx  from predominantly charged to
neutral results in a dramatic change  xxxd2113xxx  action:
block of inactivated channels without prerequisite
channel openings.
 xxxd2113xxx  blocks na channels via an intracellular pathway
delineating drug access to its receptor is critical in understanding the structural basis of drug action. fig. 7
shows that, in the whole-cell recording mode, external,
but not internal, application of  xxxd2113xxx  promotes
udb of heart na channels. the figure shows records
and summary data of experiments in which trains of repetitive depolarizing pulses (10 hz, 10 mv, 25 ms)
were applied to cells expressing cardiac na channels
in the presence of  xxxd2113xxx  (10 m). as shown in the
figure, including  xxxd2113xxx  in the recording pipette
(cells were dialyzed for 3 min before applying udb
protocols) has almost no effect on na channel current, whereas bath application of the same  xxxd2113xxx 
concentration causes marked udb of the channels
(67.3
3.5% vs. 8.4
1.5% for internal application,
p  0.01, n  4–5 cells). increasing the  xxxd2113xxx  (10
m) dialysis time from 3 to 10 min increased the
amount of udb measured to 15 1.0%, still less than
four times the amount of udb induced by external
 xxxd2113xxx  (10 m) application. these data are consistent with extracellular, but not intracellular, access to a
206

receptor for  xxxd2113xxx . however, although predominantly charged, a small fraction of  xxxd2113xxx  molecules
(1%) is neutral at physiological ph, and thus another
interpretation of these results is possible. it is possible
that neutral  xxxd2113xxx  diffuses across the cell membrane, reaches equilibrium within the cell and again
partitions into charged (99%) and neutral (1%)
forms such that drug block occurs via intracellular
 xxxd2113xxx . pipette application of the drug would be expected to have little effect as drug applied essentially as
a point source in the cell, diffuses out of the cell via its
neutral component and would be quickly diluted and
washed away in the extracellular bath.
to determine whether or not this may be the case, we
repeated the experiments of fig. 7, but replaced
 xxxd2113xxx  by qx-fl (10 m) to determine whether removal of the small fraction of neutral  xxxd2113xxx  affects
the apparent sidedness of drug action on cardiac na
channels. udb was measured under conditions of both
external and internal drug application and the sidedness of drug block was opposite to that for  xxxd2113xxx .
as shown in fig. 8, udb by externally applied qx-fl
was very weak; however, internal application of qx-fl
(3 min dialysis time before assaying for udb) resulted
in marked udb. because qx-fl cannot diffuse across
the cell membrane, these data clearly indicate that an
intracellular pathway dominates for ionized  xxxd2113xxx

to those obtained in similar experiments with the

lidocaine analogue qx-314 (fig. 8 c), show that the
small fraction of neutral  xxxd2113xxx  molecules complicates the analysis of the sidedness of  xxxd2113xxx  action.
together, it is likely that external  xxxd2113xxx  diffuses
into cells through rapid equilibrium via its neutral component, and, once inside, equilibrium is again established with 99% of intracellular drug ionized. to further test this hypothesis, using cell-attached recordings

of na channel activity, we applied  xxxd2113xxx  to the cell
outside of the patched area. under these conditions,
external drug application should only block channels if
access to the drug-binding site occurs via a pathway that
allows the drug to enter the cytoplasm by passing
through the cell membrane. as shown in fig. 9, external application of  xxxd2113xxx  (10 m) indeed causes

patch are insensitive to external qx-fl (10 m), as expected for a drug lacking a neutral component.
common molecular determinants of lidocaine, nu-fl, and
qx-fl channel block
local anesthetics have been shown to interact with specific sites in domains i, iii, and iv of voltage-gated na
channels (ragsdale et al., 1994, 1996; wang et al., 1998;
catterall, 2002; yarov-yarovoy et al., 2002). because of
the differences in physical chemical properties of
lidocaine and  xxxd2113xxx , the effects of site-specific mutations on drug block of channels has required different voltage protocols (ragsdale et al., 1994, 1996), suggesting that the different drug structures may define
unique interaction sites (li et al., 1999). in particular,
the mutations f1764a and y1771a in transmembrane
segment ivs6 of the brain type iia na channel  subunit dramatically reduced block of inactivated channels
by lidocaine (ragsdale et al., 1996). we prepared the
homologous mutants f1760a and y1767a in the human cardiac sodium channel  subunit and tested the
effects of these mutations on block by nu-fl and qxfl. as was the case for the brain channel, we find that
these mutations have little effect on drug-free channel
activity although the f1760a mutation causes a positive
shift of channel availability (fig. 10 a). we first deter208

mined if the homologous mutations in the human cardiac channel would disrupt the lidocaine-induced hyperpolarization of channel availability. our findings,
consistent with those reported in the literature for mutations of the rat cardiac na channel, indicate that
both mutations reduce this shift, but the effect is most
pronounced for the f1760a mutation (fig. 10, c
and d).
the f1760a and y1767a mutations in human heart
na channels have a very similar effect on the interactions of nu-fl with channel availability. as is the case
for lidocaine, the f1760a mutation virtually ablates the
nu-fl–induced hyperpolarization of the availability
curve, whereas the y1767a mutation reduces, but does
not eliminate, this shift (fig. 11, a and b). in light of
the fact that the mutations disrupt both the shift of the
inactivation curve induced by the neutral analogue we
reasoned that the affinity of the neutral analogue for
the inactivated state of the mutant channels should
likewise be attenuated. consequently, and similar to
the previously reported effects on lidocaine (ragsdale
et al., 1996), both mutations alter the affinity of nu-fl
for block of inactivated channels (fig. 11 c).
our findings support the notion of a common binding site in the channel pore for both nu-fl and
lidocaine. in addition, these data clearly suggest a relationship that the charge carried by  xxxd2113xxx  most
likely acts to restrict its access to this common site of action. this suggestion is consistent with the data summa-

rized in fig. 12 a that indicate that these two ivs6 mutations disrupt na channel udb by nu-fl in the
same rank order as they disrupt udb by  xxxd2113xxx  and
lidocaine despite the fact that, as shown above, nu-fl
udb is dominated by charged drug interactions with
the channel. furthermore, as shown in fig. 12 a, we
find that the f1760a mutation has pronounced effects
on udb by qx-fl. the f1760a mutation causes an
eightfold reduction (37.3
1.7% for wt vs. 4.0
0.9% for f1760a, n  3–5 cells) in udb block by qxfl (applied internally), an effect similar to that on
udb by externally applied  xxxd2113xxx . further, both
 xxxd2113xxx  and qx-fl have no effects on the recovery
rate of f1760a mutant channels (fig. 12, b and c).
these data support the notion of a common binding

site in the pore for lidocaine,  xxxd2113xxx , and both neutral and quaternary  xxxd2113xxx  analogues.
qx-fl unblocks na channels without channel openings
interestingly, channels recover from qx-fl block (very
slowly) at negative potentials where channel openings
are rare or nonexistent (fig. 3), despite the requirement of channel openings for the development of qxfl block. using single channel measurements, we
tested for, but did not find evidence of, infrequent
channel openings at the 100mv holding potential,
and thus conclude that a pathway must exist via which
the ionized drug may exit from closed channels. tetrodotoxin (ttx) is thought to block the extracellular
mouth of na channel (hille, 1975; terlau et al., 1991)

availability (v1/2) was determined from v1/2,drug  v1/2,control using v1/2 values obtained from fits of the data. for wt, f1760a, and

and has been used to examine whether permanently
charged local anesthetics can exit through the extracellular end of the pore (qu et al., 1995). to test whether
qx-fl exits from closed channels through the extracellular mouth of the pore, the rates of recovery from
qx-fl udb were measured in the present of 30 m
ttx, which blocks 95% of resting cardiac na channels in a rapidly reversible manner. if qx-fl exits
through the outer mouth of the pore, ttx should reduce the rate of recovery of qx-fl block. consistent
with this prediction, as illustrated in fig. 13, exposure
of 30 m ttx for 30 s during a total 60-s recovery period significantly reduces the rate of recovery after
udb (p  0.01, n  4–6 cells). to determine whether
or not this ttx-induced reduction in recovery from
block might be due, in part, to inhibition of na entry
through open channels during the recovery period, we
tested the effects of na-removal on recovery from
210

block. as shown in fig. 13, we found no difference in
the effects of ttx on recovery whether or not na was
present in the external solution. thus, the extracellular
mouth of the pore participates in the exit route for qxfl apparently whether or not channels are in the open
conformation.

the results of this study show for the first time that the
degree of ionization of  xxxd2113xxx  molecules at physiological ph defines the mechanism of action of the drug
and confers upon the drug molecules the prerequisite,
during repetitive activity, that channels must first open

with this change in drug structure, the molecular pharmacology of the custom synthesized drug was remarkably similar to the well-characterized na channel
blocker lidocaine.
the charged form of  xxxd2113xxx  is the active form for udb
udb by la drugs is the hallmark of their antiarrhythmic activity, it enables these drugs to be more effective
when the frequency of action potentials is high, such as
in ventricular tachycardia (rosen et al., 1975; rosen
and wit, 1983; wit and rosen, 1983). during udb,
channel block accumulates because of incomplete recovery of drug-bound channels during diastole (inter211

liu et al.

stimulus intervals). slowed recovery of drug-bound
channels can be explained by a combination of the
modulated-receptor hypothesis and the guarded-receptor model (hille, 1977a; hondeghem and katzung,
1977; starmer et al., 1984). the modulated receptor
hypothesis proposes that higher affinity for la drugs
during activated and inactivated gating states slows unbinding of drug and, consequently, recovery of the
drug-bound channels (hille, 1977a; hondeghem and
katzung, 1977). the guarded-receptor model emphasized that a state-dependent availability of the drug access path to and from the binding site influence apparent binding and unbinding kinetics (starmer et al.,
1984). both of these hypotheses suggest that there is

charged forms of nu-fl are reversed, is greatly slowed,
consistent with the higher udb level at the same condition. thus, our results clearly indicate that the charged
form of  xxxd2113xxx  is the active form that underlies
udb, which is the reported mechanism of action of
lidocaine (strichartz, 1973; wang et al., 1995).

common binding site for tertiary amine las. in this
study, our data clearly showed that udb develops predominantly by the charged forms of both  xxxd2113xxx 
and nu-fl. what are the explanations for the weakness of udb of na channels by the neutral form of
 xxxd2113xxx ? first, the neutral form may occupy a binding site that is distinct from the binding site for
charged form of  xxxd2113xxx . however, our data didn’t
support the existence of a separate neutral la binding
site apart from the charged form binding site. second,
the recovery time course of the neutral form of  xxxd2113xxx  is fast (too fast to accumulate the udb) and is comparable to recovery time course of fast na inactivation
(hille, 1977a; yeh and tanguy, 1985). as a result, upon
dissociation neutral  xxxd2113xxx  simply diffuses away
through a hydrophobic pathway. this possibility is
likely as the recovery from nu-fl block in solutions
buffered to ph 5.5, when the ratio of neutral to
212

if  xxxd2113xxx  is 99% ionized at physiological ph, how
does external  xxxd2113xxx  application result in internal
access of the charged form of the drug to the inner
mouth of the channel pore? the results presented in
fig. 9 provide a clue to this question. because  xxxd2113xxx , applied outside the area under the patch electrode, blocked channels recorded in cell-attached
patches, the drug had to diffuse across the cell membrane in order to reach the patched channels. this
must occur via the neutral  xxxd2113xxx  component,
which crosses the membrane and then equilibrates in
the intracellular solution again in neutral (1%) and
charged (99%) forms. a similar sequence must also occur across the membrane of the patch, but in this case
both the difference in membrane area (patch to whole
cell) and the volume of the absorbing solution (pipette
volume compared with volume of the cell), would limit
the drug concentration of the pipette solution. that
this is likely the case is evidenced by the rapid reversibility of drug block, which occurs when the extra-patch
 xxxd2113xxx  is removed in these experiments (fig. 9).
an indirect role of the neutral  xxxd2113xxx  component
in the development of use-dependent block of externally applied drug is also supported by the experiments
of figs. 8 and 9, which show that qx-fl is not effective
when applied externally outside of the patched area
(fig. 9), but when applied intracellularly, as effectively
as extracellularly applied  xxxd2113xxx  (fig. 7). the simplest interpretation of these results is that neutral
 xxxd2113xxx  diffuses across the lipid bilayer of the cell
membrane, equilibrates in the intracellular compartment where, as in the extracellular solution, 99% of the
 xxxd2113xxx  molecules in equilibrium are ionized. usedependent block that occurs, most likely develops as a
consequence of the intracellular charged  xxxd2113xxx 
molecules.
receptor access distinguishes lidocaine and  xxxd2113xxx 
activity and underlies distinct therapeutic profiles
as has previously been the case for the quaternary
lidocaine analogue qx-314, qx-fl provides unique insight into the access of a charged  xxxd2113xxx  analogue
to a common local anesthetic receptor-binding site on
the na channel. studies using alanine-scanning mutagenesis have provided a detailed picture of compo-

hydrophilic access pathways to a common la receptor
in fact can explain the differences in activities of these
two important drugs and must be addressed in considering novel analogues that may be useful in the treatment of cardiac electrical defects that are caused by inherited mutations of  xxxg2028xxx , the gene coding for the 
subunit of the cardiac na channel.
that flecainde has proven to be particularly useful in
the treatment of variant 3 of the long qt syndrome
and as a diagnostic tool in identifying potential brugada syndrome patients has raised the interest in understanding the mechanistic basis of mutation-altered
interactions of the drug with cardiac na channels.
since the neutral components of lidocaine and  xxxd2113xxx , as evidenced by the data presented in this study, appear to interact with a common receptor and cause
nearly identical changes in channel activity, it is most
likely mutation-induced alteration in the access of the
charged form of  xxxd2113xxx  to a common la receptor
site that accounts for the unique therapeutic efficacy
of this drug. analysis of the effects of  xxxd2113xxx  on
disease-associated mutations that independently alter
channel mean open time and/or the voltage dependence of channel availability has provided evidence in
support of this view (liu et al., 2002).

nents of a local anesthetic receptor site for which residues on the s6 segments of domains i, iii, and iv contribute (ragsdale et al., 1994, 1996; wang et al., 1998;
catterall, 2002; yarov-yarovoy et al., 2002). alaninescanning mutagenesis indicates that residues in at least
domains iii and iv that contribute to the receptor site
are likely to face the inner pore region of the channel
(catterall, 2002; yarov-yarovoy et al., 2002), and that
rotational movement of s6 segments during activation
and inactivation are likely to alter access to this site
from the intracellular region of the channel (perozo et
al., 1999; del camino et al., 2000).
we have shown previously that  xxxd2113xxx  udb requires channels to open but that block is very sensitive
to alterations in channel inactivation (liu et al., 2002).
we now find that ionized  xxxd2113xxx , which accounts for
the distinct udb of the drug, gains access to its receptor via an intracellular pathway after channels open.
mutation of the key phe residue in the local anesthetic
receptor disrupts channel block by lidocaine,  xxxd2113xxx , neutral  xxxd2113xxx  (nu-fl), and ionized  xxxd2113xxx 
(qx-fl). together, these results are very consistent
with a common receptor shared by lidocaine and
 xxxd2113xxx , access to which is restricted by differences in
ionization of the two compounds as predicted by the
modulated receptor hypothesis. our data strongly suggest that transitions into the open state change intracellular access of ionized  xxxd2113xxx  to the receptor site defined by residues on the s6 segments lining the inner
pore, and like lidocaine, block by  xxxd2113xxx  is stabilized by further transitions into the inactivated state
(liu et al., 2002).
interestingly, despite the apparent restricted access
to inner pore receptor from closed, rested states, we
find that channels blocked by charged  xxxd2113xxx  (qxfl) recover from channel block, albeit very slowly, at
negative potentials even in the absence of channel
openings (fig. 3). thus there must be a pathway available for drug exit at rest. the facts that outer pore
block by ttx slows the recovery of channels from qxfl block, even at voltages in which channels do not
open, and that removal of extracellular na has no effect on the recovery from channel block provide strong
evidence that the drug can dissociate from channels at
rest and diffuse slowly through the outer pore in a
pathway to permit very slow recovery from block. thus,
in many ways the fundamental mechanisms of action of
qx-fl and the charged lidocaine analogue qx-314 are
very similar, indicating that it is the differences in distribution of charged and neutral forms of  xxxd2113xxx  and
lidocaine and not differences in chemical structures
that accounts for the distinct voltage-dependent profiles of the two drugs. as predicted by the modulated
receptor hypothesis (hille, 1977a; hondeghem and
katzung, 1977), it thus appears that hydrophobic and
