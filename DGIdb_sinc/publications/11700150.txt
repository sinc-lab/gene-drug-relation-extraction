the aim of this review is to provide clinicians with a picture of the mechanisms
by which: (i) histamine and histaminergic agonists act on the vestibular system
both peripherally and centrally; and (ii) histaminergic agonists and antagonists
interfere with the recovery process after peripheral vestibular lesion. we have
focused on  xxxd321xxx , a structural analogue of histamine with weak histamine

 xxxg1078xxx  agonist and more potent  xxxg1080xxx  antagonist properties, to review
the currently available data on the role of the histaminergic system in the recovery
process after peripheral vestibular deficits and the effects of histamine analogues
in the clinical treatment of vertigo.
this review provides new insights into the basic mechanisms by which  xxxd321xxx  improves vestibular compensation in animal models of unilateral vestibular dysfunction, and elucidates particularly the mechanisms of action of this
substance at the level of the cns.
it is proposed that  xxxd321xxx  may reduce peripherally the asymmetric functioning of the sensory vestibular organs in addition to increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow by antagonising local h3 heteroreceptors.  xxxd321xxx 
acts centrally by enhancing histamine synthesis within tuberomammillary nuclei
of the posterior hypothalamus and histamine release within vestibular nuclei
through antagonism of h3 autoreceptors. this mechanism, together with less
specific effects of  xxxd321xxx  on alertness regulation through cerebral h1 receptors, should promote and facilitate central vestibular compensation.
elucidation of the mechanisms of action of  xxxd321xxx  is of particular interest
for the treatment of vestibular and cochlear disorders and vertigo.

histamine is a biogenous amine of the brain that
regulates various cerebral functions and induces
many physiological effects. for example, the histaminergic pathways are involved in wakefulness,
thermoregulation, pituitary function and cardiovascular regulation. histamine modifies the neuronal activity of cortical and subcortical structures
through neuromodulation and/or neurotransmission; therefore, histamine is generally considered
to be a neuromodulatory transmitter.[1-6]
antihistamines were the first drugs used in the
treatment of allergic symptoms; they have since
been found to be effective in the treatment of vertigo, probably due to a centrally induced depressive
effect.[7-9]  xxxd321xxx , a structural analogue of histamine, has also been used as an antivertigo agent
for over 20 years.[7] the vascular actions of histamine and histamine analogues have been known
for a long time,[10] but the structural properties of
these molecules and the role of pre- and post-synaptic
histamine receptors in the neuromodulation of
histaminergic transmission have only recently
been elucidated. other recent investigations have
uncovered a vestibulo-hypothalamo-vestibular histaminergic pathway that may be involved in the
physiology and pathophysiology of balance (see
section 2.3). a series of animal experiments have

further identified the mechanisms by which histamine analogues would act on the sensory organs
(see section 3.2), the vestibular pathways and the
histaminergic system (see section 3.3).
the aim of this article is to provide clinicians
with a picture of the working mechanisms of histamine and  xxxd321xxx  or other histamine analogues
at the peripheral and central levels. animal studies
have provided interesting insights into how structural analogues of histamine, such as  xxxd321xxx ,
act on vestibular functions and how effective they
are in assisting recovery from vestibular lesions
and treating vertigo.
1. pathophysiology of the
vestibular system
the peripheral vestibular receptors are made up
of sensory cells that are sensitive to both angular
accelerations (detected by the semicircular canals)
and linear accelerations (detected by the otoliths of
the utricule and saccule). the otolith system also
detects changes in the gravito-inertial forces that
result from the modification of head position in
space. the peripheral labyrinth therefore constitutes a central inertial platform that detects the position and movement of the head.[11-13]

histamine and  xxxd321xxx  in vertigo

the vestibular system have been previously described in full.[11] this system conveys an uninterrupted flow of both static and dynamic information
to the brain. the vestibular neural messages travelling in the vestibular nerves are delivered to the
four main nuclei (lateral, superior, medial and inferior) that form the central vestibular nuclei complexes. these nuclei constitute a centre where multiple modality sensory information (including visual,
somatosensory and vestibular inputs) is integrated
to form the basis for central reconstruction of head
velocity signals in three-dimensional space by the
brain.[11,14-16]
in addition to integrating spatial cues, the vestibular nuclei are involved in pre-motor and preperception functions. they are important in controlling posture and balance, head and eye stabilisation (i.e. gaze stabilisation in space), and in elaborating a central representation of body position
and motion in space.
the control of balance and eye movement is
partly subserved by second-order vestibular neurons with descending (vestibulospinal system) and
ascending (vestibulo-ocular system) axonal projections. branching vestibular neurons influencing
both oculomotor and spinal neurons contribute to
gaze stabilisation. vestibulocortical pathways relaying through the subnuclei of the thalamus subserve more cognitive functions such as body orientation in space (subjective vertical), body perception (body scheme) and spatial memory. in turn,
vestibular cortical areas (parieto-insular vestibular
cortex, areas 2v and 3a) and subcortical (inferior
olive, reticular formation, cerebellum) structures
modulate vestibular nuclei activity and control vestibular functions.[17,18]
consequently, a peripheral labyrinth deficit or
a unilateral lesion of the vestibular nerve will cause
a three-fold syndrome: related to posture (imbalance, falls, deviation of locomotor trajectory), oculomotor (spontaneous nystagmus, skew deviation,
oscillopsia) and perception (vertigo, deviation of
the perceived vertical). the deficits that form the
vestibulospinal and vestibulo-ocular syndromes
are common in a large number of species. most of

what is known about the perception syndrome derives from observations made in patients with vestibular dysfunction. as a general rule, all three syndromes include both static and dynamic components.[19,20] figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of the vestibular pathways mediating
vestibular responses in the roll plane and of their
pathophysiology.
compensation for these static and dynamic vestibular deficits constitutes a good model for the
study of cns plasticity and the investigation of
adaptive capacities of the adult brain.[22] as a general rule, compensation for static and dynamic deficits are characterised by different time courses.
compensation for static deficits is extensive, often
complete, and can take only days, but compensation for dynamic deficits can take several months
and can be incomplete (sometimes minimal). the
dissociation between static and dynamic deficits
compensation can be partly explained by the intervention of different compensatory mechanisms in
the vestibular compensation process. pre-existing
or new behavioural strategies, sensory (proprioception, vision) as well as functional (restoration
of spontaneous and evoked vestibular nuclei activity) substitution mechanisms have been reported.[22]
in the literature, few results have demonstrated that
structural changes in the vestibular nuclei occur
after vestibular lesion.[20] in contrast, many neurophysiological (changes in the static and dynamic
properties of vestibular cells) and neurochemical
(up- or down-regulation of inhibitory amino acids,
acetylcholine, neuropeptides, and/or their receptors) modifications have been demonstrated experimentally.[20-24]
it is now well known that drug treatment can
considerably modify the course of vestibular deficit compensation, either by accelerating (through
treatment with stimulants) or by slowing down
(with sedatives) the recovery process.[25] vertigo
and its disabling vegetative manifestations may be
treated with antihistamines, acetylcholine receptor
antagonists or sedatives, that all act centrally to
depress vestibular responses and to suppress the
symptoms of vertigo. this therapy may be admincns drugs 2001; 15 (11)

been used in the management of vestibular pathology,[7] very little was known until recently about
the role of the histaminergic system in the control
of vestibular functions and in the adaptive process
after vestibular lesion.

histamine is a neuromodulatory transmitter: the
histaminergic system is widely distributed throughout various cns structures.[2-5] histamine and its
three different categories of receptors have been
found in the vestibular nuclei complexes, strongly
suggesting that histamine plays a significant role
in the regulation of vestibular functions.[1,6,28]

biosynthesis of histamine within the cns
largely determines its cerebral distribution because
it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier
(bbb). histamine has a heterogenous distribution
in the brain that parallels that of the enzyme that
synthesises it,  xxxg1040xxx  (hdc).[29]
histamine in the brain is stored in both neuronal
structures (50%), and non-neuronal (50%) structures such as the microvascular endothelium and
the mast cells. the most important portion of histamine in the neuronal compartment is associated
with the synaptic vesicles in the nerve endings,
where it is synthesised. three types of cns histamine receptors have been identified in mammals:
postsynaptic histamine h1 and h2 receptors[28,30]
and presynaptic histamine h3 receptors[31,32] (figure 2). h1 receptors are coupled with phosphatidylinositol, h2 receptors with adenylate cyclase and
h3 receptors with g-proteins. all three histaminergic receptors are metabotropic receptors, acting intracellularly through second messenger systems.

immunocytochemical staining in the superior and
medial nuclei compared with the lateral and inferior nuclei.
autoradiography using specific radioactive ligands made it possible to visualise the three types
of histamine receptors. h1 receptors are diffusely
and heterogeneously distributed throughout the
cns.[30] they are blocked by antihistamines, for
example,  xxxd3050xxx .[7] there are only a few specific agonists of h1 receptors, and these compounds
do not readily cross the bbb.
h2 receptors are also diffusely and heterogeneously distributed throughout the cns.[28,35] impromidine is a selective agonist of these receptors
and cimetidine is a good, relatively selective antagonist. more potent and selective than cimetidine,

using immunocytochemistry, histaminergic
neurons were found to be exclusively located in
the posterior hypothalamus, mainly in the tuberomammillary nucleus.[4,29,33] these neurons fire in
a low, regular, spontaneous manner, and exhibit
long-duration action potentials and slow axonal
conduction. the histaminergic nerve endings project diffusely throughout the whole brain and show
moderately sized swellings with a typical beaded
appearance, which stain strongly. such properties
are typically seen in unmyelinated systems that
exert neuromodulatory actions. we were the first
to describe the projection of histaminergic nerve
fibres to the four main vestibular nuclei in the cat

 xxxg1079xxx  antagonists (zolantidine,  xxxd2082xxx ,
tiotidine) have been recently synthesised.
the same diffuse and heterogeneous distribution
has been observed for h3 receptors.[32] the standard agonist and antagonist for this receptor are alphamethylhistamine and thioperamide, respectively.
these substances regulate the synthesis and release
of histamine by acting on the h3 autoreceptors
found on histaminergic nerve endings. histamine
and  xxxg1080xxx  agonists inhibit histamine turnover, whereas  xxxg1080xxx  antagonists promote the
synthesis, turnover and release of histamine.[36] h3
heteroreceptors are localised on nonhistaminergic
neuron endings, suggesting that the neuromodulatory action of histamine on its target cells may influence the synthesis and release of other neurotransmitters (figure 2).
it must be noted that all three categories of histamine receptors are present in the vestibular nuclei, at least in the guinea pig.[6,34,37,38]
2.2 histamine and neuromodulation of
vestibular nuclei neurons

experimental data suggest that histamine modifies the central activity of the vestibular nuclei
cells, and consequently, could affect the processing
of sensory information in this structure and the
control of vestibular functions. for example, hypothalamic histaminergic neurons project directly
into the vestibular nuclei in the rat; it has been
hypothesised that these afferents regulate motion
sickness.[39]
histamine modulation of second-order vestibular neuronal activity has been demonstrated in both
in vitro and in vivo experiments; different effects
were observed, depending on the preparation used.
the neuronal spontaneous firing rate decreased
after iontophoresis of histamine in cat vestibular
nuclei in the first in vivo studies.[40] this inhibitory
effect was confirmed by kirsten and sharma[41]
who observed histamine-induced inhibitions of
78 and 68% in the medial nucleus neurons and
the lateral nucleus cells, respectively. facilitatory
effects were seen in 9 and 27% of these respective
nuclei neurons. the in vitro studies, carefully con© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

ducted on vestibular nucleus slices using a larger
sample of units, clearly pointed to histamine-induced
membrane depolarisation of the vestibular neurons.
histamine slightly increased the spontaneous firing rate of medial vestibular cells in both rats[42,43]
and guinea pigs.[37] this effect was mimicked and
inhibited by  xxxg1079xxx  agonists and antagonists,
respectively, suggesting that the histamine depolarising effect is mediated through h2 receptors.[37]
further experiments suggested that the h1 receptors were also involved.[44]
the electrophysiological changes seen in the
vestibular nuclei complexes have effects on function: behavioural modifications were recorded in animals receiving histamine receptor ligands infused
chronically in the vestibular nuclei on one side.[38]
generally, the postural and oculomotor deficits observed were similar to those seen after unilateral
vestibular lesion.[38] the vestibular postural syndrome was reproduced with an infusion of  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists or  xxxg1080xxx  agonists. the
postural asymmetries were reversed with  xxxg1079xxx  agonists and  xxxg1080xxx  antagonists. similar
findings were reported for the oculomotor syndrome. it is generally assumed that these agonists
and antagonists act by creating an imbalance in
electrical activity between the homologous vestibular nuclei, similar to that produced by a unilateral
vestibular lesion.
2.3 evidence for a histaminergic
vestibulo-hypothalamo-vestibular loop

unilateral stimulation of the labyrinth, which
causes asymmetrical vestibular nuclei activity
(electrophysiological recordings) and ocular movements typical of vestibular lesion-induced eye
disturbances, has recently been observed to trigger
a marked increase in histamine release in the
posterior hypothalamus.[45] roughly similar effects were demonstrated with microdialysis following both cold or warm caloric and electrical
stimulation of the labyrinth. in addition, the effects
of a more natural and bilateral vestibular stimulation were investigated in rats by placing them in a
centrifuge and subjecting them to rotations which
cns drugs 2001; 15 (11)

histamine and  xxxd321xxx  in vertigo

can cause the behavioural symptoms of motion
sickness.[39] histamine levels increased in the hypothalamus and pons regions of healthy, intact rats;
no effect was seen in rats with both labyrinths destroyed or treated with alpha-methylhistidine, an inhibitor of the enzyme that synthesises histamine.
expression of the fos protein was used as a neuronal marker to functionally map brain stem activity after stimulation or lesion of the vestibular system. in rats submitted to increased gravito-inertial
forces (hypergravity) in a centrifuge, the spatial
pattern of fos induction involved the vestibular nuclei and associated structures (inferior olive, autonomic nuclei) and the tuberomammillary of the
posterior hypothalamus.[46] we found a roughly
similar pattern of fos expression in unilateral vestibular neurectomised cats.[47]
together these data clearly demonstrate that increased or imbalanced activity in the vestibular nuclei complexes leads to the activation of the central
histaminergic system. this activation occurs via a
vestibulo-hypothalamo-vestibular loop which may
be important in the control of vestibular functions
and in the adaptive response to vestibular lesion
and environmental changes.
3. histamine and the histamine
analogue  xxxd321xxx  in peripheral and
central vestibular disorders
3.1 receptor binding affinity

 xxxd321xxx  (n-alpha-methyl-2-pyridylethylamine) is a structural analogue of histamine with
similar pharmacological properties. the effects of
 xxxd321xxx  on histamine brain receptors have been
studied in several biological models.[48] it has been
shown that  xxxd321xxx  is a weak  xxxg1078xxx  agonist, a more potent  xxxg1080xxx  antagonist and has
negligible  xxxg1079xxx  activity. affinity for receptors of other neurotransmitters demonstrated, but
affinity for autonomic  xxxg831xxx  receptors is suspected (see
section 3.2).[49,50]
several studies have clearly demonstrated that
 xxxd321xxx  is an  xxxg1078xxx  agonist:

•  xxxd321xxx  and  xxxd3050xxx  (an  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist) compete for binding to cerebellar cell
membranes in guinea pigs.[51,52]
• both  xxxd321xxx  and histamine produce concentration-dependent hydrolysis of labelled glycogen in murine brain cortex sections, but the peak
glycogenolytic effect of  xxxd321xxx  is weaker
than that of histamine.[48]
• in a dose-dependent manner,  xxxd321xxx  stimulates the  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation induced by
impromidine (a selective  xxxg1079xxx  agonist)
but at a 20% lower level than histamine.[48]
• the binding of  xxxd3050xxx  to the murine brain
cortex in vivo is inhibited following the systemic administration of  xxxd321xxx , therefore
 xxxd321xxx  must be able to cross the bbb.[48]
following systemic administration, the intracerebral concentration of  xxxd321xxx  was equivalent to half of the concentration of the compound in blood.[52] however, the affinity of  xxxd321xxx  for the  xxxg1078xxx  is weak: its action at
h1 receptors was only observed at dosages 100fold higher than therapeutic dosages.[48]
other studies have demonstrated that  xxxd321xxx  is also an  xxxg1080xxx  antagonist:
• in a dose-dependent manner,  xxxd321xxx  blocks
the suppression of synaptic release of histamine
and other transmitters induced by exogenous histamine via the h3 autoreceptor.[31]
• the concentration of  xxxd321xxx  required for
this effect in vivo is considerably lower than that
necessary to produce excitation of the cerebral
h1 and/or h2 receptors.[48]
the affinity of  xxxd321xxx  for the  xxxg1080xxx  in
the brain, as measured by the dissociation constant,
is less than that of thioperamide, another  xxxg1080xxx  antagonist.[36,37,48]

action of  xxxd321xxx 
3.2.1 vascular mechanisms in the inner ear

the increase in cochlear blood flow following
systemic administration of  xxxd321xxx  was first reported many years ago.[53-55] the mechanism of

lation was studied more recently by laurikainen
et al.[49,50] using laser doppler flowmetry. the increase in cochlear blood flow caused by  xxxd321xxx 
is inhibited by atropine (an acetylcholine receptor
antagonist), idazoxan (an autonomic  xxxg831xxx -receptor
antagonist) or thioperamide (an  xxxg1080xxx  antagonist), but not modified by cimetidine (an  xxxg1079xxx  antagonist) or alpha-methylhistamine (an  xxxg1080xxx  agonist). therefore,  xxxd321xxx  antagonises
the presynaptic h3 heteroreceptors of the cochleovestibular vascular system via the activation of
autonomic  xxxg831xxx -receptors.[49,50] this effect is only
achieved by administering  xxxd321xxx  through the
vascular route (catheterisation of the antero-inferior
cerebellar artery) and not by direct application to
the inner ear through the round window.[49]
peripheral vasodilation has also been observed
with systemic administration of  xxxd321xxx , as evidenced by a decrease in blood pressure which is
blocked by prior administration of promethazine.
however, the  xxxd321xxx  dose required to produce
the cochleovestibular effect was four-fold lower than
that required to produce the systemic effect (0.5
vs 2.1 mg/kg to produce 50% of the maximum effect).[49]
it appears that the  xxxd321xxx -induced increase
in cochlear blood flow is associated with an increase in vascular conductivity and a decrease in
systemic blood pressure (figure 3),[49] and may result primarily from vasodilation of the anterior
inferior cerebellar artery. this effect appears to
involve h1 receptors, presynaptic h3 heteroreceptors and autonomic  xxxg831xxx -receptors, at least in the inner ear of the guinea pig.[50]
in contrast, an infusion of  xxxd321xxx  induced a
decrease in systemic blood pressure and blood flow
in the vestibular apparatus, followed by a sustained
increase in vestibular blood flow while the blood
pressure rapidly returned to normal.[56] regulation
of the vestibular blood flow in the posterior semicircular canal ampulla has been observed in guinea
pigs, and can be influenced by various factors including  xxxd321xxx .[56-58] the vascular control of
the vestibule may be different to that of the cochlea
and requires further investigation.

3.2.2 physiological mechanisms on inner ear
sensory organs

the effect of  xxxd321xxx  on isolated preparations of frog posterior semicircular canal was recently examined.[59] the drug was administered via
the endolymphatic or perilymphatic fluid, and its
effects on spontaneous or evoked resting discharges of ampullar receptors were measured. no
effect was observed with endolymphatic administration. in contrast, perilymphatic administration

of  xxxd321xxx  decreased the resting discharge of
the ampullar receptor to a large extent, but had a
minimal effect on the mechanically evoked response. drug concentrations as low as 10–7 mol/l
were sufficient to reduce the resting firing rate,
whereas inhibition of the evoked activity was obtained at doses as high as 10–2 mol/l (figure 4).
the effect of  xxxd321xxx  on vestibular receptors in the frog suggests that the drug does not
act on the mechanosensitive channels of the hair
cells, but on the basolateral membranes of the
sensory cells, dark cells and/or afferent nerve terminals. the mechanism of action may involve histamine receptors in the peripheral vestibular system,[60] although this remains to be confirmed.
whatever the mechanism of action involved, it
could contribute to the antivertigo effects of  xxxd321xxx .
3.3 central mechanisms and sites of action
of  xxxd321xxx 

neurectomy in a cat model. posturolocomotor function was totally restored within 5 to 6 weeks,[61,62]
as evidenced by normalisation of the support surface area (static index) and the locomotor performance on a rotating beam (dynamic index) [figure
5]. the restoration of the spontaneous activity of
vestibular neurons located in the ipsilateral lateral
nucleus occurred over a similar time period (unpublished observations).[6] oral administration of
high dosages of  xxxd321xxx  (50 or 100 mg/kg/day)
over a time period of 3 to 4 weeks reduced the time
to recovery by 2 weeks for both static and kinetic function compared with no treatment or placebo.[61]
we assumed therefore that  xxxd321xxx  enhances
the behavioural recovery of vestibular functions in
these animals, but how the drug achieves this was
not clear.[61] since the drug is a structural analogue
of histamine, an  xxxg1080xxx  antagonist and a partial  xxxg1078xxx  agonist (section 3.1), we hypothesised that it increases histamine turnover (synthesis) and release. this hypothesis was tested using
immunocytochemical techniques (section 3.3.2).

changes were investigated in both the tuberomammillary nuclei (which contain the histaminergic

sated) after neurectomy.[62] cats without a vestibular lesion that were treated with  xxxd321xxx  exhibited a nearly total lack of histamine staining in
these structures, a result that was reproduced in cats
treated with thioperamide, an  xxxg1080xxx  antagonist (figure 6). the combination of vestibular lesion and  xxxd321xxx  treatment also resulted in a
histamine immunoreactivity level that was close to
zero.
these results strongly suggested that  xxxd321xxx 
increases histamine turnover and synthesis, consistent with its pharmacological properties. low levels of histamine immunoreactivity in the vestibular
and tuberomammillary nuclei were attributed to
depletion of histamine in synaptic vesicles and
nerve terminals, the result of increased histamine
synthesis and release. this, in turn, would be due
to the blocking effect of histamine on the presynaptic h3 receptors. additional experiments were
needed to confirm that these are the central mechanisms of action of  xxxd321xxx .
3.3.3 interaction with the histaminergic system:
new molecular findings

the effects of both  xxxd321xxx  treatment and
vestibular lesion on the histaminergic system were
investigated using in situ hybridisation and autoradiography techniques. hybridisation was used to
analyse changes in messenger rna (mrna) coding for hdc in the tuberomammillary nuclei; autoradiography was used performed with a tritiated
selective  xxxg1080xxx  agonist (3h-n-alpha-methylhistamine; 3h-nalphamh) and used to investigate the
density of h3 binding sites (which mediate histamine autoinhibition) in the tuberomammillary and
vestibular nuclei.
quantification of both hdc mrna and  xxxg1080xxx  binding site densities showed asymmetrical
changes after unilateral vestibular neurectomy in
the cat, with an up-regulation of hdc mrna and
a decrease in 3h-nalphamh labelling on the lesioned
side (unpublished observations). in contrast, treatment with  xxxd321xxx  induced symmetrical changes
in intact animals, with an up-regulation of hdc
mrna and a reduction in 3h-nalphamh labelling on
both sides (unpublished observations). figure 7 ilcns drugs 2001; 15 (11)

these results clearly demonstrate that  xxxd321xxx  increases the synthesis of histamine by the histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nuclei by blocking the presynaptic h3 autoreceptors.
histamine release is then enhanced in several cns
structures, including the tuberomammillary and
the vestibular nuclei. unilateral vestibular lesion
would produce similar but asymmetrical effects
through a different mechanism of action: the activation of a vestibulo-hypothalamo-vestibular loop.

3.3.4 effects on vestibular nuclei neurons and
interaction with histamine

 xxxd321xxx  exerts a neuromodulatory action on
central vestibular neuronal activity, which is characterised by changes in excitability both in vivo
and in vitro.
 xxxd321xxx  inhibits the response of neurons in
the medial vestibular nucleus to rotatory stimulation in the horizontal plane[63] and the spontaneous
firing rate of polysynaptic neurons in the lateral
vestibular nucleus in vivo.[64] however, few neurons were recorded in these studies and the nature
of the cells (for example, type i, type ii, inhibitory
or excitatory neurons) was not determined; therefore, it is not possible to claim that  xxxd321xxx  inhibits the spontaneous or the evoked activity of
second-order vestibular neurons.
the effect of  xxxd321xxx  on vestibular neuronal
activity was more carefully studied in vitro[44] by
recording the tonic activity of medial vestibular
nucleus neurons from slices of brainstem preparations taken from young adult rats. however, the
actions of h3 receptors are generally not detectable
in slices. histamine had an excitatory effect on
these neurons via the h1 and h2 receptors. when
applied alone, low doses of  xxxd321xxx  had no excitatory effect on eight neurons activated by histamine, and high concentrations (300 to 1000
mumol/l) induced weak excitation (figure 8). conversely, the excitatory effect of histamine was
reduced with simultaneous application of  xxxd321xxx . this effect was dependent on  xxxd321xxx  concentration and could not be reproduced when the
neuron was stimulated by serotonin. the  xxxd321xxx -induced reduction of the histamine-induced

histamine and  xxxd321xxx  in vertigo

excitatory response of vestibular cells can be explained by the partial agonistic properties of  xxxd321xxx  at the  xxxg1078xxx  level and competition
between endogenous histamine and  xxxd321xxx  for
h1 receptors.
these hypotheses were supported by our recent
molecular investigation (unpublished observations). we found that the combination of vestibular
lesion and treatment with  xxxd321xxx  led to the
down-regulation of hdc mrna expression at 1
week after treatment and up-regulation at 3 weeks.
these observations can again be explained by competition between  xxxd321xxx  and histamine for the
 xxxg1080xxx . indeed, changes in the binding of 3hnalphamh to h3 receptors, characterised by a reduction in the density of binding sites at 1 week postlesion and an increase at 3 weeks’ post-lesion,
strongly suggests a competitive interaction between histamine (the release of which is increased
in the vestibular nuclei during the acute stage) and
 xxxd321xxx  (which predominates over histamine
during the compensated stage). these results do
not exclude another mechanism hypothesis involving plasticity at the cellular level: long term treatment with  xxxd321xxx  could lead to a permanent h3
receptor blockage which could then produce a reactive or compensatory up-regulation of this receptor subtype.
3.4 effect of  xxxd321xxx  on cortical activity:
vigilance and psychomotor performance
3.4.1 nystagmus and vestibulo-ocular responses

in patients with paroxysmal vertigo of 3 months’
duration who were receiving  xxxd321xxx  16, 32
or 64mg three times daily, the duration and amplitude of the nystagmus response induced by different stimulations were evaluated in a doubleblind, placebo-controlled study.[65] following lowfrequency sinusoidal rotation in darkness or highfrequency passive rotation of the head, the amplitude of the induced nystagmus decreased by 20 and
50% with  xxxd321xxx  16 and 32mg, respectively.
reduction in the amplitude of nystagmus was not
observed when visuovestibular interaction was allowed in the presence of a visual target in the dark.

865

such results suggest that  xxxd321xxx  exerts its action on the vestibular nuclei.
in patients with vertigo who responded to  xxxd321xxx  treatment,  xxxd321xxx  was not found to have
a dose-dependent effect on the vestibulo-ocular
reflex, as it does in healthy individuals.[66] indeed,
the duration of the nystagmus response induced in
ten healthy individuals submitted to the swinging
seat test was decreased by 38 and 59% with  xxxd321xxx  16 and 32mg, respectively. the effect peaked
at 3 to 4 hours after  xxxd321xxx  administration and
no adverse effects were observed.[67]
3.4.2 vestibular evoked potentials

in a preliminary double-blind study,  xxxd321xxx 
produced different effects on vestibular evoked
potentials in healthy individuals and patients with
peripheral vestibular disorders.[66] in patients with
vertigo, the pathologically delayed mean latency
of vestibular evoked potentials was normalised following administration of  xxxd321xxx  48mg three
times daily. a return towards control values occurred shortly after drug administration; the effect
peaked at 3 hours postdose. conversely, a progressive delay was introduced to the mean latency of
vestibular evoked potentials following administration of the same dosage of  xxxd321xxx  to healthy
individuals.
these findings suggest that the effect of  xxxd321xxx  on cortical activity may differ depending on
whether recipients have vertigo. since vertigo is a
result, at least in part, of an imbalance of activity
between the vestibular nuclei complexes on each
side, the difference in cortical activity could be due
to the activation of the vestibulo-hypothalamovestibular loop. as discussed in sections 2.3 and
3.3, stimulation of this pathway induces histamine
release in the vestibular nuclei, and  xxxd321xxx  and
endogenous histamine compete for binding to histamine receptors at the cellular level.
3.4.3 psychomotor performance and driving tasks

a double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the effects of high dosages of  xxxd321xxx 
(72mg three times daily for 3 days) or the antipsychotic drug  xxxd3018xxx  (5mg three times
daily) on the psychomotor performances of healthy

volunteers who participated in a driving test.[68]
the tests were carried out at baseline and at 1 week
later (following drug administration) and examined
reaction time and kinetic visual acuity (psychomotor performance) and weaving and gap estimation
(driving tasks).
no sedative effect was observed following administration of  xxxd321xxx . individuals who received  xxxd321xxx  performed similarly to those who
received placebo or who did not receive any treatment. in contrast, psychomotor and driving performances were markedly altered following administration of  xxxd3018xxx . this drug relieves
vertigo, nausea and vomiting of vestibular origin.
it has a dual antagonistic action in the cns, blocking both dopamine d2 receptors and h1 receptors.
since dopamine is known to facilitate cortical
arousal, the alterations in behaviour observed after
administration of  xxxd3018xxx  should directly
result from the blockade of dopamine receptors.
the blockade of h1 receptors may contribute indirectly to the behavioural alterations because histamine induces excitatory effects on the neuronal

activity of cortical and subcortical structures by activating h1 receptors.[33]
4. how does the interaction between
 xxxd321xxx  and histamine improve
the vestibular compensation process
and vertigo?
there is a growing body of experimental data
that describes how histamine and  xxxd321xxx  act on
the body at the peripheral and central levels. it has
been discovered that:
• histamine is involved in the regulation of vestibular functions (section 2).
• histamine enhances the restoration of vestibular
function after a deficit (through adaptation) by
activating a vestibulo-hypothalamo-vestibular
loop (section 2.3).
•  xxxd321xxx  also has beneficial effects on this
recovery process and interacts with histamine at
the cellular level (section 3.3).
•  xxxd321xxx  acts on peripheral and central targets, through h1 and h3 receptors (sections 3.2
and 3.3).
cns drugs 2001; 15 (11)

histamine and  xxxd321xxx  in vertigo

• in the cns,  xxxd321xxx  increases histamine
synthesis and release by blocking h3 autoreceptors (section 3.3).
the main property previously ascribed to histamine, its vasodilative action on blood vessels,[1-6,10]
is also a property of  xxxd321xxx . the vascular effects
of  xxxd321xxx  have been fully described and it is
now well established that this drug acts on the
vestibulocochlear vasculature, increasing blood flow
and vascular conductivity and decreasing systemic
blood pressure through h3 heteroreceptors and h1
receptors and autonomic  xxxg831xxx -receptors.[49,50,53-58]
histamine and structural analogues of histamine like  xxxd321xxx  are also effective in the treatment of vestibular disturbances unrelated to vascular insufficiency, clearly indicating that there are
other, probably more active, mechanisms through
which they contribute to antivertigo effects. these
can be subdivided into nonspecific and specific
working mechanisms, acting either peripherally or
centrally.
 xxxd321xxx  has no adverse effects and is devoid
of sedative action (section 3.4.3).[7,10,65,67,68] in addition, it increases histamine synthesis and release,
enhancing alertness and vigilance.[33] this nonspecific arousal mechanism can play a significant role
in the recovery process in patients with vestibular
lesion. it is well known that sedative drugs slow
down functional recovery, whereas stimulants accelerate recovery and increase sensorimotor activity.[25] the latter action is considered to be a key
element in vestibular compensation in both animal
models[69] and humans.[22]
the specific mechanisms of action of  xxxd321xxx  have been elucidated in animal models using
autoradiography, in situ hybridisation and electrophysiology (section 3.3).
in the periphery, it was found that  xxxd321xxx 
decreased the ampullar receptor resting discharge,
an effect that could be mediated by histamine receptors in the peripheral vestibular sensory system.
this peripheral vestibular mechanism may also be
involved in reducing the asymmetrical functioning
of the bilateral sensory receptors, but is not completely understood.

867

the most important discoveries involving the
mechanisms of  xxxd321xxx  concern the action of
the drug on the histaminergic system and histamine
receptors.  xxxd321xxx  increases histamine turnover (synthesis) and release by blocking h3 autoreceptors. histamine has depolarising effects on
second-order vestibular cells in vestibular nuclei
complexes, exerted through h1 receptors. this
central vestibular mechanism is probably involved
in reducing asymmetrical activity of the vestibular
nuclei neurons on both sides. the restoration of
balanced electrical activity between the homologous vestibular nuclei, as demonstrated in vivo and
in conscious animal models,[70] is central to the
compensation for static vestibular deficits.[22] additionally, there is a close correlation between
behavioural adaptation and central re-equilibration
of vestibular nuclei activity.[22,70]
the interaction between exogenous  xxxd321xxx 
and endogenous histamine released in response to
 xxxd321xxx  or a vestibular lesion (via the activation
of a vestibulo-hypothalamo-vestibular loop) gives
a complex picture of the central action of the drug.
the competition between histamine and  xxxd321xxx  for binding to h1 and h3 receptors varies depending on the dose administered, the time period of
administration and the stage of the vestibular lesion (acute or compensated). the mechanisms behind this variation, the neuromodulating action of
histamine on the synthesis and release of other
neurotransmitters (e.g. acetylcholine) and the  xxxd321xxx -induced plasticity of h3 receptors remain
unresolved and require further investigation.
5. conclusions and
clinical implications
several of the mechanisms by which  xxxd321xxx 
acts on the vestibular system have been identified.
in the peripheral vestibular organs,  xxxd321xxx 
decreases the ampullar receptor resting discharge,
which reduces the asymmetrical functioning of the
sensory vestibular organs.  xxxd321xxx  also increases vestibulocochlear blood flow by antagonising local h3 heteroreceptors, thereby protecting the vestibulocochlear sensory organ.
cns drugs 2001; 15 (11)

lacour & sterkers

in the central vestibular nuclei,  xxxd321xxx  enhances histamine synthesis within tuberomammillary nuclei and histamine release within vestibular nuclei through antagonism of h3 autoreceptors. this mechanism should promote and facilitate
central vestibular compensation.
additionally,  xxxd321xxx  regulates alertness,
affecting the cortical and subcortical structures of
the cns through a partial agonist effect on cerebral
h1 receptors.
most of the mechanisms by which histamine
and  xxxd321xxx  act on the vestibular system have
been elucidated. the clinical implications of these
mechanisms in the vestibular system (peripherally
and centrally) are of interest in the treatment of
vestibular and cochlear dysfunctions and vertigo.
 xxxd321xxx  is widely used in the treatment of meniere’s disease and vertigo, and may yet have other
therapeutic applications in inner ear disorders such
as tinnitus, sudden hearing loss or noise-induced
hearing loss.
