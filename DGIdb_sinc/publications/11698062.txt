abstract
the dibenzopyran cannabinoids ždelta-9 ž d9 .-tetrahydrocannabinol and nabilone. are clinically used to suppress nausea and vomiting
produced by chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin. the purpose of this investigation was to investigate the antiemetic potential of the
aminoalkylindole cannabinoid receptor agonist win 55, 212-2 w ržq.-w2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-wžmorpholinyl. methylx pyrolol w1,2,3-dex1,4-benzoxazin-ylx-ž1-naphthalenyl. methanone mesylatex against cisplatin-induced vomiting. different doses of win 55, 212-2 ž0, 1, 2.5
and 5 mgrkg, i.p.. reduced both the frequency of cisplatin ž20 mgrkg, i.p..-induced emesis žid50 s 0.5 mgrkg. as well as the percentage
of shrews vomiting žid50 s 1.2 mgrkg. in a dose-dependent manner. significant reductions in emesis frequency occurred from 2.5
mgrkg dose of win 55, 212-2, whereas significant total protection from vomiting was afforded at its 5 mgrkg dose. the antiemetic
actions of a 5-mgrkg dose of win 55, 212-2 against cisplatin ž20 mgrkg, i.p..-induced vomiting were reversed by nonemetic
subcutaneous doses ž0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mgrkg. of the cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  antagonistrinverse agonist sr 141716a w n-piperidino5-ž4-chlorophenyl.-1-ž2,4-dichlorophenyl.- xxxd2148xxx -3-carboxamidex žid50 s 0.27 and 0.47 mgrkg, respectively. but not by a
5-mgrkg dose of the cannabinoid cb 2 receptor antagonist sr 144528 w n-wž1s .-endo-1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo w2.2.1x heptan-2-ylx5-ž4chloro-3-methylphenyl.-1-ž4-methybenzyl.  xxxd3045xxx -3-carboxamidex. the effects of the cited doses of win 55, 212-2 were also
investigated on several motor parameters žspontaneous locomotor activity, duration of movement and rearing frequency.. significant
reductions in motor parameters were only observed at its highest tested dose žid50 s 1.97, 2.75 and 2.8 mgrkg; respectively.. sr
141716a ž0, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 mgrkg. also reversed the motor suppressant effects of a 5-mgrkg dose of win 55, 212-2 žid50 s 0.39, 0.1
and 0.3 mgrkg, respectively. and significant reversals were seen from its 0.5 and 1 mgrkg doses. these results suggest that win 55,
212-2 reduces both emesis and indeces of locomotion via the stimulation of cannabinoid cb1 receptors. however, cannabinoid cb1
receptors in different loci are most likely responsible for the antiemetic and motor suppressive effects of win 55, 212-2 since reduction in
the frequency of vomiting occurred at lower doses relative to its sedative actions. q 2001 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
both the cloning of cannabinoid žcb1 and cb 2 . receptors žmatsuda et al., 1990; munro et al., 1993. and synthesis of their potent and selective antagonists žrinaldicarmona et al., 1994, 1998. have helped to open new
avenues for cannabinoid research. the current progress
may ultimately lead to potential cannabinoid use in the
clinic for the numerous therapeutic applications for which
cannabinoids are being evaluated žpertwee, 1999.. besides
their established antiemetic action in the clinic žreviews:

ceptor agonists also possess appetite stimulant, anticonvulsant, antinociceptive and hypothermic properties žformukong et al., 1989; mattes et al., 1994; pertwee, 1999..
although the antiemetic activity of the main psychoactive
component of marijuana plant, delta- xxxd1943xxx  ž d9-tetrahydrocannabinol. and its synthetic analogs
žnabilone and levonantradol. seem to be superior or equivalent to dopamine d 2 receptor antagonists in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, their efficacy is not as good
as the more potent antiemetics such as the  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists žgralla, 1999.. until recently, the receptor
mechanism by which cannabinoids produce their antiemetic
action was not known. it seems that cannabinoids prevent chemotherapy-induced emesis via activation of the
cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  since its selective antagonist

was prevented by d9-tetrahydrocannabinol and its analogs

methanone mesylatex. moreover, nonemetic doses of sr
141716a was recently shown to prevent the antiemetic
action of d9-tetrahydrocannabinol against cisplatin-induced
emesis ždarmani, 2001b..
currently, very little is known regarding the antiemetic structure activity relationship of different cannabinoids
in any species. cannabinoid receptor agonists can be
classified according to their chemical structure into four
groups žpertwee, 1999.. the first of these is the aclassical cannabinoidb group, which is made of dibenzopyran
derivatives and includes d9-tetrahydrocannabinol. the second, anonclassical cannabinoidb group, consists of bicyclic
and tricyclic analogs of d9-tetrahydrocannabinol that lack
a pyran ring, e.g. cp 55, 940. the third group are
aminoalkylindoles and their prototype is the pravadolline
derivative win 55, 212-2. the fourth is the aeicosanoidb
group, which contains  xxxd208xxx  derivatives such as
anandamide.
some clinical studies have suggested that the antiemetic
action of cannabinoids may be related to their sedative
effect andror production of a apsychological highb žchang
et al., 1979; lucas and laszlo, 1980; orr and mckernan,
1980; sallan et al., 1975, 1980.. this work was undertaken
to investigate the antiemetic potential and the cannabimimetic profile of win 55, 212-2 in the least shrew.
this insectivore species has recently been characterized as
a new animal model for various emetic stimuli ždarmani,
1998, 2001a,b; darmani et al., 1999; dukat et al., 2000..
the least shrew are small žadult 4–6 g in weight., shortlegged, mouse-like mammals with long, pointed snouts
and short dense dark brown fur, which reside in central
and north america žchurchfield, 1990.. this species is
very active, and unlike most laboratory animals, do not
come to rest after acclimation to their environment. reduction in motor activity is one component of the tetrad of
behaviours used for the initial evaluation, and for establishing a general cannabimimetic pharmacological profile in
rodents žmartin et al., 1995.. as shown for other species
žferrari et al., 1999., the least shrew provides a good
opportunity for comparing the antiemetic and motor depressant profile of win 55, 212-2 and other cannabinoids.
thus, the purpose of the present study was: ž1. to determine whether win 55, 212-2 can prevent emesis produced
by the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin in the least shrew
ždarmani, 1998.; ž2. to show whether selective cannabinoid cb1 and cb 2 receptor antagonists žsr 141716a and
sr 144528, respectively. can reverse the antiemetic action
of win 55, 212-2 against cisplatin-induced emesis, and ž3.

to demonstrate whether motor suppressive action of win
55, 212-2 is related to its antiemetic activity.

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals and drugs
shrews ž c. parõa. were bred and maintained in the
animal facilities of the kirksville college of osteopathic
medicine. both male and female shrews ž4–6 g, 45–70
days old. were used throughout the study. the animals
were kept on a 14:10-h light–dark cycle at a humidity
controlled room temperature of 21 " 1 8c with ad lib
supply of food and water. the feeding and maintenance of
shrews are fully described elsewhere ždarmani, 1998;
darmani et al., 1999.. ržq.-win 55, 212-2 w ržq.w2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-wžmorpholinyl. methylx pyrolol

žptžnh 3 . 2 cl 2 . were purchased from research biochemicals natick, ma. sr 141716a w n-piperidino-5-ž4chlorophenyl.-1-ž 2,4-dichlorophenyl .- xxxd2148xxx -3carboxamidex and sr 144528 w n-wž1s .-endo-1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo w2.2.1x heptan-2-ylx5-ž4-chloro-3-methylphenyl.1-ž4-methybenzyl.  xxxd3045xxx -3-carboxamidex were given to
us by professor r. theobald which were generously donated by sanofi recherche žmontpellier, france.. all drugs
were dissolved in a 1:1:18 solution of ethanol: mulphor:0.9% saline to twice the stated drug concentrations.
these drug concentrations were further diluted by the
addition of an equal volume of saline. this procedure was
necessary, because the 1:1:18 vehicle mixture can cause
emesis in up to 20% of animals by itself. the final vehicle
mixture induced emesis in up to 10% of shrews. in our
preliminary studies, we also used ethanol as the dissolving
agent for cannabinoid agonists and antagonists. however,
concentrations of ethanol required to maintain intermediate
to larger doses of the cited agents dissolved in saline
would produce unwanted behaviours such as cataplexy in
the shrew and thus the cited special solvent containing a
small amount of ethanol was used as the dissolving
medium. all drugs were administered at a volume of 0.1
mlr10 g of body weight. all animals received care according to the aguide for the care and use of laboratory
animals,b dhss publication, revised, 1985.
2.2. emesis studies
the present protocols were based upon our previous
emesis studies in the least shrew ždarmani, 1998, 2001a,b;
darmani et al., 1999.. all experiments were performed
between 0800 and 1700 h. since published studies in dogs
and shrews have shown that d9-tetrahydrocannabinol by
itself can induce nondose-dependent vomiting žlowe, 1946;
shannon et al., 1978; darmani, 2001b., the emetic effects

n.a. darmanir european journal of pharmacology 430 (2001) 49–58

of varying doses of win 55, 212-2 in the shrew were
investigated first. on the test day, the shrews were transferred to the experimental room and were allowed to
acclimate for at least 1 h prior to experimentation. to
habituate the shrews to the test environment, each animal
was randomly selected and transferred to a 20 = 18 = 21
cm clean clear plastic cage and offered 4 meal worms
žtenebrio sp.. 30 min prior to experimentation. different
groups of shrews were then injected intraperitoneally with
vehicle ž n s 11. or varying doses of win, 55, 212-2 ž1,
2.5 and 15 mgrkg; five shrews per group.. immediately
following injection, each shrew was placed in the observation cage and the frequency of vomiting žoral ejections of
food or liquid; mean " s.e.m.. was recorded for each
individual shrew for the next 60 min. these data showed
that intraperitoneal administration of the cited doses of
win 55, 212-2 did not produce emesis in the least shrew.
previous studies in this laboratory have shown that
intraperitoneal administration of the chemotherapeutic
agent cisplatin can induce vomiting in the least shrew in a
dose-dependent manner ždarmani, 1998, 2001b.. indeed, a
20-mgrkg intraperitoneal dose of cisplatin can produce
vomiting in 90–100% of least shrews. the latter dose was
chosen to demonstrate the possible antiemetic effects of
win 55, 212-2 on the cisplatin-induced vomiting. the
antiemetic doses of win 55, 212-2 were based upon our
preliminary experiments as well as published studies
ždarmani, 2001a,b.. shrews were offered 4 meal worms
prior to drug administration. different groups of shrews
were first injected intraperitoneally with varying doses of
win 55, 212-2 ž0, 1, 2.5, or 5; n s 8–9 per group. and a
20-mgrkg dose of cisplatin ži.p... each shrew was then
observed individually for the next 60 min immediately
following the two simultaneous injections. the frequency
of emesis was recorded as described above. another group
of shrews ž n s 11. received two corresponding vehicle
injections and were observed in an identical fashion. this
experiment revealed that win 55, 212-2 prevented cisplatin-induced emesis in a dose-dependent manner and its
5 mgrkg dose produces maximal antiemetic effects.
this laboratory has previously shown that intraperitoneal administration of the selective cannabinoid cb1
receptor antagonist sr 141716a produces emesis in the
least shrew at its 10 and 20 mgrkg doses ždarmani,
2001a.. when administered subcutaneously, sr 141716a
was a less efficient emetogenic agent since only its 40
mgrkg dose caused a significant degree of vomiting.
thus, in the next experiment substantially lower subcutaneous doses of sr 141716a ž0.25–1 mgrkg. were used to
reverse the antiemetic effect of a 5-mgrkg dose of win
55, 212-2 against cisplatin ž20 mgrkg, i.p..-induced vomiting. thus, at 0 time different groups of shrews were
injected subcutaneously with either vehicle ž n s 8. or
varying doses of sr 141716a ž0.25, 0.5 and 1 mgrkg.
and were then offered four meal worms. ten minutes later,
each shrew received intraperitoneally win 55, 212-2 ž5

51

mgrkg. and cisplatin ž20 mgrkg. and the emesis frequency was recorded for the next 60 min as described
above. a 5-mgrkg subcutaneous dose of sr 144528 was
used to reverse the antiemetic effect of a 5-mgrkg dose of
win 55, 212-2 on cisplatin-induced emesis in the same
manner as described for the  xxxg479xxx  antagonist.

2.3. locomotor studies
on the test day, shrews were brought in their home
cages from animal quarters and were allowed to acclimate
for at least 1 h to a semi-dark environment. the reduced
light condition was necessary for the computerized video
tracking, motion analysis, and behaviour recognition system wethovision žversion 2.0., noldus information technology, costerweg, netherlandsx to work efficiently. the
parameters of ethovision were set to record the following
triad of locomotion activities: ž1. spontaneous locomotor
activity in terms of the total distance moved in meters
wmoving was recorded when a shrew traveled a distance
greater than 2 cm in the plain of the observation cagex; ž2.
total duration of movement in seconds wthe summed time
recorded for any type of movementx, and ž3. rearing
frequency wa rearing event is recorded as a 20% decrease
in surface area when shrews stand upright as seen by the
overhead video camerax. our preliminary experiments indicated a 20% change in the surface area for shrews is
equivalent to 90% to 110% of our manual recording of
rearing frequency. different versions of this system have
been previously used for determination and validation of
these locomotor parameters in different animal species
žspruijt et al., 1994; winberg et al., 1993; young et al.,
1997; darmani, 2001b..
after acclimation to the dark laboratory environment,
shrews were further acclimated in white plastic dummy
observation cages ž28 = 28 = 14 cm. for 1 h prior to
testing. in the first experiment, different groups of shrews
were injected intraperitoneally with either vehicle ž n s 12.
or varying doses of win 55, 212-2 ž1, 2.5 and 5 mgrkg,
n s 7 per group.. then each shrew was individually placed
in an observation cage of the same dimension and the
discussed locomotor parameters were recorded for 50 min
starting at the 10-min post-injection period. win 55, 212-2
significantly reduced all three parameters in shrews at its 5
mgrkg dose. in the next experiment, the effect of different
subcutaneous doses of sr 141716a was investigated on
the locomotor reducing properties of the 5 mgrkg dose of
win 55, 212-2. thus, at 0 time, different shrews were
injected with varying subcutaneous doses of sr 141716a
ž0, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 mgrkg; n s 8–11 per group.. at 30
min, each shrew received intraperitoneally a 5-mgrkg
dose of win 55, 212-2. ten minutes later ži.e. at 40 min.,
the locomotor activity parameters were recorded for the
next 50 min as described earlier.

2.4. statistical analysis
the frequency of emesis data were analyzed by the
kruskal–wallis žkw. nonparametric one-way analysis of
variance žanova. and posthoc analysis by dunn’s multiple comparisons test. a p value of - 0.05 was necessary
to achieve statistical significance. the incidence of emesis
žnumber of animals vomiting. were analyzed by the
fisher’s exact test to determine whether there were differences between groups. when appropriate, pairwise comparisons were also made by this method. for some emesis
data, the two-tailed mann–whitney test was used. the
id50 values žthe inhibitory dose that prevented emesis in
50% of shrews, or the dose which reduced emesis frequency by 50%. were calculated by the use of a computerized program žgraphpad inplot, san diego, ca.. a oneway analysis of variance žanova. followed by dunnett’s
multiple comparisons test were used to analyze the locomotor data.

3. results
3.1. emesis
as with our previous studies ždarmani, 2001a,b., intraperitoneal administration of the final concentration of the
special solvent žethanol:emulphor:saline. produced emesis
in up to 10% of shrews. intraperitoneal administration of
1, 2.5 or 5 mgrkg doses of win 55, 212-2 in the above
solvent did not cause significant emesis.

this study shows that along with the other classes of
cannabinoid agonists žsee introduction., the aminoalkylindole cannabinoid win 55, 212-2, also possesses antiemetic
efficacy against cisplatin-induced emesis. win 55, 212-2
appears to be a more efficacious antiemetic in reducing the
frequency of cisplatin-induced emesis žid50 s 0.5 mgrkg.
than totally protecting shrews from vomiting žid50 s 1.2..
indeed, a 5-mgrkg dose of win 55, 212-2 was required to
completely protect 7 of the 8 tested shrews from vomiting
ž p - 0.05., whereas its 2.5 mgrkg dose only afforded
protection in three of the nine tested shrews ž p ) 0.05..
on the other hand, the 2.5 mgrkg dose of win 55, 212-2
significantly attenuated ž p - 0.05. the frequency of vomits
by 82%. furthermore, its lowest tested dose ž1 mgrkg.
also reduced the vomit frequency ž69%. but just failed to
attain significance. other cannabinoids possess a similar
pattern of antiemetic action since they are more potent in
reducing the amount or frequency of vomits rather than
affording total emesis protection in both patients žchang et
al., 1979; gralla et al., 1984; lucas and laszlo, 1980;
sweet et al., 1981; sallan et al., 1980. and animals
ždarmani, 2001b; feigenbaum et al., 1989; ferrari et al.,
1999. treated with chemotherapeutic agents. several basic
and clinical reports indicate that d9-tetrahydrocannabinol
by itself can induce a nondose-dependent degree of emesis
in 20–30% of test subjects in several but not all vomiting
species ždarmani, 2001b; lowe, 1946; shannon et al.,
1978; london et al., 1979; feigenbaum et al., 1989;
mccarthy et al., 1984; noyes et al., 1975; frytak et al.,
1979; orr and mckernan, 1980.. unlike d9-tetrahydrocannabinol ždarmani, 2001b., win 55, 212-2 did not
produce emesis in any of the tested shrews. the antiemetic
potency of win 55, 212-2 is similar to d9-tetrahydrocannabinol žid50 1.86. against cisplatin ž20 mgrkg.induced vomiting in the least shrew ždarmani, 2001b..
biochemical studies support the present results since d9tetrahydrocannabinol and win 55, 212-2 have a similar
affinity for the cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  žpertwee, 1999..
however, we have previously shown that relative to d9-tetrahydrocannabinol žid 20 s 15.2 mgrkg., win 55, 212-2

n.a. darmanir european journal of pharmacology 430 (2001) 49–58

more potently protected shrews from sr 141716a-induced
emesis žid50 s 3.95. ždarmani, 2001a.. these differential
findings suggest that either: ž1. the emetic effects of sr
141716a and cisplatin are mediated via different mechanisms or sites, andror ž2. the potency rank order of
cannabinoid agonists may not reflect their efficacy žpertwee, 1999., and their relative maximal agonist effects can
vary across different brain regions žbreivogel and childers,
2000.. variability in some of the cited ed50 and id50
values as revealed by their relatively larger s.e.m.’s may
also account for these differences.
the second important finding of this study is that the
antiemetic action of win 55, 212-2 is probably mediated
via cannabinoid cb1 receptors. several findings support
this notion: ž1. low doses of the cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx 
antagonist sr 141716a ž0.25–1 mgrkg., counteracted the
antiemetic action of an effective antiemetic dose of win
55, 212-2 in cisplatin-treated shrews by increasing both the
frequency of emesis and the percent of shrews vomiting in
a potent and dose-dependent manner; ž2. unlike sr
141716a, a relatively larger dose of the selective cannabinoid cb 2 receptor antagonist sr 144528 ž5 mgrkg. failed
to counter this antiemetic effect; ž3. d9-tetrahydrocannabinol’s antiemetic action against cisplatin-induced vomiting can be reversed by sr 141716a and not by sr 144528
ždarmani, 2001b.; ž4. large doses ž10–40 mgrkg. of sr
141716a žand not sr 144528. can induce vomiting in the
least shrew and the induced behaviour is cannabinoid
agonist sensitive ždarmani et al., 2001a., and ž5. win 55,
212-2 decreases rodent intestinal propulsive activity, defecation and gastrointestinal transit via a cannabinoid cb1
receptor-mediated, sr 141716a-sensitive mechanism
žcolombo et al., 1998; izzo et al., 1999.. furthermore, sr
141716a was shown to increase the latter gastrointestinal
effects when administered alone. other cannabinoid receptor agonists produce similar depressive effects on such
intestinal functions žcalignano et al., 1997; krowicki et
al., 1999; shook and burks, 1989.. however, cannabinoid
cb 2 receptor may also affect intestinal motility žhanus et
al., 1999.. the subcutaneous doses of sr 141716a used
for the reversal of antiemetic effects in the present study
are 40–160 times lower than that required to produce
significant emesis by itself via this route ždarmani, 2001a..
furthermore, up to 10 mgrkg, sr 141716a does not
modify cisplatin-induced emesis ždarmani, 2001b.. sr
141716a seems to be more potent in counteracting the
antiemetic effect of win 55, 212-2 ž5 mgrkg. than d9-tetrahydrocannabinol ž5 mgrkg. ždarmani, 2001b. against
cisplatin-induced emesis. indeed, a 10-mgrkg dose of sr
141716a was necessary to significantly reverse d9-tetrahydrocannabinol’s antiemetic action. such differential effects of sr 141716a has also been noted in other test
systems, and the dose of the cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx 
antagonist required to block the pharmacological actions of
cannabinoids may depend upon the specific effect of interest žlichtman and martin, 1997.. indeed, susceptibility of

55

win 55, 212-2 and cp 55, 940 to antagonism by sr
141716a is respectively 5 and 33 times less in the myenteric plexus preparation than in the mouse vas deferens,
whereas the susceptibility of d9-tetrahydrocannabinol to
sr 141716a is the same in the two preparations žpertwee
et al., 1995, 1996..
another aspect of the present study was to compare the
antiemetic effects of win 55, 212-2 with its motor
depressive actions since some clinical findings suggest that
sedation andror production of apsychological highb may
contribute to its antiemetic effects žsee introduction.. although direct comparison of emotional effects of cannabinoids in animals and humans is uncertain, numerous models for evaluating the psychoactivity profile of cannabinoid
agonists have been developed žmartin et al., 1995.. reduction in motor activity parameters is one component of the
tetrad of behaviours used for the evaluation of cannabimimetic pharmacological profile of cannabinoids in
rodents. although the main effects of cannabinoids on
rodent locomotion is hypoactivity and catalepsy žcompton
et al., 1992; 1996; romero et al., 1996; gifford et al.,
1999; ferrari et al., 1999., these agents may produce
biphasic effects on movement which are time- and dosedependent žcarlini et al., 1970; davis et al., 1972; sulcova
et al., 1998; sanudo-pena
˜
˜ et al., 1999, 2000; darmani,
2001a.. in the least shrew, intraperitoneal injection of win
55, 212-2 ž1–5 mgrkg. reduced the triad of motor parameters wspontaneous locomotor activity žtotal distance
moved., duration of movement; and the rearing frequencyx
in a dose-dependent manner with similar id50 values
ž1.97–2.8 mgrkg.. however, a significant reduction was
only observed at its highest tested dose ž5 mgrkg. which
blocked the cited behaviours by 71–94%. although significant motor inhibition and complete protection of emesis
by win 55, 212-2 occurred at its highest dose tested, it
did, however, attenuate the frequency of cisplatin-induced
emesis at lower doses w56% at 1 mgrkg ž p ) 0.05. and
75% at 2.5 mgrkg ž p - 0.05.x. furthermore, a 2.5-mgrkg
dose of d9-tetrahydrocannabinol has been shown to significantly reduce the discussed cisplatin-induced emesis parameters in the least shrew while only its 20 mgrkg dose
caused significant reductions in the triad of motor behaviours ždarmani, 2001b.. in addition, the more potent
cannabinoid receptor agonist hu 210 also exhibits
antiemetic effects in pigeons at doses which do not significantly affect motor function žferrari et al., 1999.. as in the
case of d9-tetrahydrocannabinol ždarmani, 2001b., the
motor depressant effects of win 55, 212-2 was counteracted by sr 141716a in a potent and dose-dependent
manner in the least shrew. however, much lower doses of
sr 141716a were required to significantly reverse the
motor suppressive effects of win 55, 212-2 than those
required for the reversal of corresponding effects of d9-tetrahydrocannabinol. the direct effect of sr 141716a on
motor behaviours is not univocal and seems to be dependent upon the route of administration, species used and the

56

n.a. darmanir european journal of pharmacology 430 (2001) 49–58

experimental conditions under which the motor behaviours
are observed žcompton et al., 1996; darmani, 2001b;
gallate and mcgregor, 1999; masserano et al., 1999;
poncelet et al., 1999; rinaldi-carmona et al., 1994.. most
of these studies have found that sr 141716a by itself has
no effect on locomotion while others indicate either enhancement or suppression of locomotor behaviours. in the
least shrew, it has been shown that sr 141716a by itself
does not induce a consistent effect on the discussed triad
of locomotor parameters when administered either subcutaneously ž1–10 mgrkg. or intraperitoneally ž0.2–40
mgrkg. ždarmani, 2001b.. however, some doses of sr
141716a did produce a nondose-dependent suppression of
some components of the triad of motor behaviours.
although antiemetic and motor depressive effects of
win 55, 212-2 are cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx -mediated
effects, different brain loci are most likely to be responsible for these events. the highest density of cannabinoid
cb1 receptors is found in the basal ganglia and its subcortical structures that form the extrapyramidal system žglass
et al., 1997; herkenham et al., 1991; mailleux and vanderhaegen, 1992; tsou et al., 1998.. cannabinoids exert their
motor effects through these extrapyrimidal structures
žsanudo-pena
˜
˜ et al., 1999, 2000.. the area postrema, the
medullary formation and the nucleus of solitary tractus are
involved in the regulation of emesis žmitchelson, 1992..
while brain stem appears to be cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx 
sparse, however, the solitary tract nucleus and the area
postrema contain significant amounts of cannabinoid cb1
receptors žherkenham et al., 1991; tsou et al., 1998..
these brain loci in the medulla are probably involved in
the antiemetic action of win 55, 212-2 and other cannabinoids. this conclusion is supported by a report that direct
application of d9-tetrahydrocannabinol to the dorsal surface of rat medulla attenuates gastric tone which in turn
may reduce nausea and vomiting žkrowicki et al., 1999..
however, cisplatin-induced vomiting is a complex phenomenon contributed to by the discussed central structures
as well as the vagus, dorsal vagal complex and the myenteric complex žveyrat-follet et al., 1997; naylor and rudd,
1996.. moreover, cisplatin produces emesis in two phases
žacute and delayed. and the present study was concerned
with the prevention of the acute phase of the induced
emesis. interestingly, one aspect of clinical use of cannabinoids in chemotherapy is that patients who are protected
from the acute phase of emesis also respond well during
the delayed phase which serotonin  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists poorly control žabrahamov et al., 1995; chan et al.,
1987; dalzell et al., 1986; naylor and rudd, 1996..
in summary, similar to dibenzopyran derivatives že.g.
9
d -tetrahydrocannabinol., the aminoalkylindole cannabinoid win 55, 212-2 also possesses antiemetic properties.
the antiemetic potency of win, 212-2 is similar to d9-tetrahydrocannabinol against cisplatin-induced vomiting in
the least shrew. both cannabinoids reduce the frequency of
vomiting at doses lower than those required to signifi-

cantly affect locomotor parameters. the antiemetic and
sedative actions of cannabinoids are probably mediated by
different loci and both effects are cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx -mediated since these events were reversed by sr
141716a.
