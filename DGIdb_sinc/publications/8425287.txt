response of nonreentrant catecholamine-mediated ventricular tachycardia to endogenous adenosine and acetylcholine. evidence for myocardial receptor...  reentrant ventricular tachycardia (vt) is known to be insensitive to the nucleoside adenosine. however, we have previously identified a form of nonreentrant, catecholamine-mediated vt that can be initiated with rapid pacing, demonstrates cycle length dependence, and is sensitive to exogenous adenosine as well as to the valsalva maneuver. the mechanism of this tachycardia is thought to be due to a catecholamine-induced, camp-mediated increase in intracellular calcium, resulting in delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. the antiarrhythmic effects of exogenous adenosine and valsalva on this form of vt may be due to receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase or to noncardiac receptor-mediated effects, i.e., exogenous adenosine may modulate vt through alterations in autonomic tone by activation of arterial chemoreceptors, and valsalva has been shown to decrease venous return, resulting in a reduction in cardiac dimensions and myocardial stretch. to clarify this issue and circumvent both autonomic and noncardiac receptor effects, the response of nonreentrant catecholamine-mediated vt to endogenous adenosine and acetylcholine was evaluated.
