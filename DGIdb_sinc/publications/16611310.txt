summary
much of the variability in the sensitivity to warfarin in anticoagulated
patients is associated with the c.)1639g > a polymorphism of the vitamin
k-epoxide reductase ( xxxg2418xxx ) gene. however, its association with the
 xxxd59xxx  dose in patients under anticoagulant therapy has not been
studied. the c.)1639g > a genotype of  xxxg2418xxx  was determined in 113
patients on stable anticoagulation requiring low (n ¼ 42), medium (n ¼ 42)
or high (n ¼ 21)  xxxd59xxx  doses. to evaluate the association between
 xxxd59xxx  requirements and the c.)1639g > a variant, multivariate
logistic regression models were fitted, adjusting for age, gender, and the
c.430c > t and c.1075a > c variants of  xxxg587xxx  (cyp2c9). a
total of 90æ5% of the patients in the low  xxxd59xxx  dose group carried
the a allele of  xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639g > a. the a allele independently increased
the odds of requiring a low  xxxd59xxx  dose [odds ratio (or) 9æ4; 95%
confidence interval (ci) 1æ9–46æ4; p ¼ 0æ006], especially when the
homozygous form was present (or 44æ2; 95% ci 5æ5–354æ6; p < 0æ001).
the a allele was less frequent in the high dose group showing an inverse
association with the requirement for high doses (or 0æ04; 95% ci 0æ01–0æ22;
p < 0æ001). the a allele of the c.)1639g > a polymorphism of  xxxg2418xxx  is
therefore associated with a low-dose requirement for  xxxd59xxx  in
patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.
keywords:  xxxd3522xxx , drugs, anticoagulation.

the coumarin derivative  xxxd59xxx  is widely used to
prevent recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis in european
and latin-american countries. the appropriate dose varies
greatly and it is difficult to predict on an individual basis.
although this may partly be due to environmental factors, i.e.
simultaneous exposure to other drugs that interfere with the
metabolism of  xxxd59xxx , dietary habits or other health
conditions, the inter-individual variability is thought to be
largely determined by hereditary factors (meyer, 2000). among
the genetic determinants, the variants c.430c > t (arg144cys)
and c.1075a > c (ile359leu) of  xxxg587xxx 
(cyp2c9), involved in the metabolism of warfarin and
 xxxd59xxx , have been shown to influence the anticoagulant dosage (aithal et al, 1999; daly & king, 2005). progress
has recently been made in our knowledge of the  xxxd3522xxx 
cycle: the gene coding for the enzyme responsible for the
transformation of  xxxd3522xxx  2,3-epoxide to vitamin

k-hydroquinone has been cloned (li et al, 2004; rost et al,
2004).  xxxd3522xxx -hydroquinone is the co-factor for the
carboxylase that adds a molecule of carbon dioxide to glutamic
acid, producing c-carboxyglutamic acid (c-glu). the c-glu
residues are essential for some clotting factors, such as factors
ii, vii, ix, x and protein c, s and z, to bind phospholipids
and thus be functional. the enzyme, called  xxxd3522xxx -epoxide
reductase ( xxxg2418xxx ), is the target of the coumarin derivatives.
importantly, several genetic variations of the  xxxg2418xxx  gene
have been found to influence sensitivity to warfarin (rost et al,
2004; d’andrea et al, 2005; geisen et al, 2005; quteineh et al,
2005; rieder et al, 2005). twenty-eight polymorphisms have
been described in this gene, three main haplotypes covering
almost the whole genetic variability of  xxxg2418xxx .  xxxg2418xxx *2
haplotype has been found to account for most of the variability
in response to oral anticoagulants (geisen et al, 2005; rieder
et al, 2005; sconce et al, 2005; yuan et al, 2005). the

c.)1639g > a polymorphism marks the  xxxg2418xxx *2 haplotype
(geisen et al, 2005), and its association with increased
response to  xxxd59xxx  has been shown in a group of
healthy subjects (bodin et al, 2005). however, its influence in
patients receiving  xxxd59xxx  treatment have not been
studied to date. our aim was to study the effect of the
c.)1639g > a polymorphism on the  xxxd59xxx  dosage
requirements in a group of patients under stable anticoagulation.

materials and methods
participants
a total of 113 outpatients attending the hospital clı́nico
universitario de salamanca (spain) between january and
october 2001 who had maintained stable anticoagulation
[international normalised ratio (inr) between 2 and 3æ2] with
 xxxd59xxx  for at least 3 months were included in the
study. we considered a patient on stable anticoagulation as
one whose  xxxd59xxx  dose requirement had remained
constant for at least the previous 3 months, and this dose was
the same (variation <25%) as the mean annual dose, and was
enough to keep the inr within therapeutic ranges. two
patients with liver disease and two patients with thyroid
disease were excluded. four patients could not be analysed.
the final population consisted of 42 consecutive patients
requiring a low  xxxd59xxx  dose (7 mg/week or less), 42
consecutive patients requiring a medium dose (>7 mg and
<28 mg per week) and 21 consecutive patients requiring a high
dose (28 mg/week or more). low, medium and high weekly
dose categories were arbitrarily chosen, taking into account the
fact that around 80% of subjects in our population of patients
under anticoagulation need a dose within the range defined as
the medium dose (hermida et al, 2002).
data concerning age, sex, weekly dose required, exposure to
other drugs affecting the  xxxd59xxx  metabolism and the
genotype of the c.430c > t and c.1075a > c variants of
cyp2c9 were recorded as described elsewhere (hermida et al,
2002). all subjects had given informed consent to participate
in the study.

 xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639g > a genotyping
genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction followed
by digestion with msp1 (new england biolabs, ipswich, ma,
usa) according to described methods with minor modifications (sconce et al, 2005). the forward and reverse primers
were 5¢-gccagcaggagagggaaata-3¢ and 5¢-agtttggactacaggtgcct-3¢ respectively.

statistical analysis
in order to evaluate the association between  xxxd59xxx 
requirements and the presence of the a allele at the )1639
184

position in the  xxxg2418xxx  gene, multivariable logistic regression
models were fitted after adjusting for age, gender and the
presence of other polymorphisms (cyp2c9:c.430c > t and
c.1075a > c). we fitted two separate models. in both cases,
the reference category was the group requiring a medium dose
of  xxxd59xxx . in the first model, we estimated the odds
ratio (or) for requiring a low dose (excluding those with a
requirement for a high dose). in the second model, we
estimated the or for requiring a ‘high’ dose (excluding those
with a requirement for a low dose).
in the case of the cyp2c9:c.430c > t and c.1075a > c
polymorphisms, heterozygous and homozygous subjects for
the allelic variants were merged in the same category due to the
low prevalence of homozygous subjects.
a linear regression model was also performed to assess the
effect of the a allele of  xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639g > a on the weekly
dose of  xxxd59xxx  (as a continuous variable) within the
low dose group.
interaction (effect modification) was assessed by introducing product-terms in the logistic regression models and
considering any p-value < 0æ05 for the likelihood ratio test of
this product-term as evidence of a significant interaction.
in order to assess the proportion of carriers of both
 xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639g > a and c.1075a > c polymorphisms
requiring a low  xxxd59xxx  dose, we used exact methods
[exact binomial confidence intervals (ci) and exact fisher
test]. statistical analyses were performed with stata v9
software (statacorp lp, college station, tx, usa).

influence of  xxxg2418xxx  genotype on  xxxd59xxx  dosage
(90æ5%) carried the a allele. however, the a allele was less
frequent in the group of 21 patients requiring a high
 xxxd59xxx  dose: among these patients only 6 (28æ6%)
carried the a allele in the heterozygous form and none of them
carried the aa genotype.
the mean age and the c.430c > t and c.1075a > c variants
of cyp2c9 in the three groups of patients have been reported
previously (hermida et al, 2002). we showed that both age
and the polymorphisms of cyp2c9, especially the c.1075a > c
variant, influenced the  xxxd59xxx  dose requirements,
while gender and other drugs did not (hermida et al, 2002).
we fitted logistic regression models to assess the independent
contribution of  xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639g > a to the inter-individual
variability of the pharmacological response to  xxxd59xxx ,
taking also into account the effect of polymorphisms of
cyp2c9, of age and sex. the results of this analysis are shown
in table ii. the presence of the a allele increased the odds of
requiring a low  xxxd59xxx  dose. this effect was notably
higher when the a allele was present in the homozygous form:
or 44æ2 (95% ci 5æ5–354æ6; p < 0æ001). moreover, an inverse
correlation was seen between the mean weekly dose of
 xxxd59xxx  required and bearing at least one  xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639a allele (b coefficient, )0æ35; p ¼ 0æ043) within the low
dose group. accordingly, not only did the a allele influence the
odds of requiring a low  xxxd59xxx  dose, but it also
exerted an independent effect against requiring a high
 xxxd59xxx  dose.
the sensitivity and specificity of carrying the  xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639a allele for low dose requirements were 90æ5% (95% ci
77æ4–97æ3) and 40% (95% ci 27æ6–52æ8) respectively.

and the cyp2c9 variants
remarkably, within the group requiring low  xxxd59xxx 
doses, all patients (n ¼ 42) were carriers of at least one of the
three polymorphisms analysed. in contrast, among the 21
patients who required a high  xxxd59xxx  dose, 13 of them
(61æ9%) were free of the three polymorphisms. in the medium
dose group, 36 of 42 subjects carried at least one of the three
polymorphisms. all patients who were simultaneously carriers
of both the  xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639g > a allele and the cyp2c9:c.1075a > c polymorphism (n ¼ 10) required a low
 xxxd59xxx  dose, whereas 11 of 20 patients (55%) carrying
the a allele of vkorc and cyp2c9:c.430c > t belonged to
the low  xxxd59xxx  dose group. when an exact method
(binomial ci) was used to assess the proportion of carriers of
both  xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639a and cyp2c9:c.1075a > c polymorphisms requiring a low  xxxd59xxx  dose, the 95% ci
estimated that 69–100% of patients that carried both mutations would require a low  xxxd59xxx  dose (p < 0æ001,
fisher exact test).

population has been analysed and the results are available
elsewhere (hermida et al, 2002). however, at the time that
work was carried out, the polymorphisms of the  xxxg2418xxx  gene
had not yet been identified. for this reason, we updated the
estimates for the independent association between both age
and the variants of cyp2c9 and the odds of requiring a low
 xxxd59xxx  dose after also adjusting for the
 xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639g > a polymorphism in the multivariate
analysis. as can be observed in table ii, age was still an
independent factor influencing the  xxxd59xxx  dose after
adjusting for the c.)1639g > a polymorphism: every additional year of age was associated with 16% higher odds of
needing a lower  xxxd59xxx  dose. bearing the c.430c > t
or c.1075a > c cyp2c9 variants also remained independently
associated with a higher odds of requiring a low  xxxd59xxx  dose.

*logistic regression models adjusted for gender and for the other
variables shown in the table. the group of patients taking the medium
dose of  xxxd59xxx  was considered the reference category in both
models.

the recent identification of the  xxxg2418xxx  gene (li et al, 2004;
rost et al, 2004), involved in the  xxxd3522xxx  cycle, has prompted
the search for new polymorphisms that can contribute to
explaining the high interindividual variability in the dose
requirements for oral anticoagulants. much of this variability
has been found to be due to the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype. notably,
37% of the total variability in response to  xxxd59xxx  in a
group of healthy subjects was reported to be attributable to
 xxxg2418xxx  (bodin et al, 2005). although several haplotypes have
been identified in the  xxxg2418xxx  gene, those including the
c.)1639g > a polymorphism have been associated with variability in the sensitivity to warfarin or  xxxd59xxx  (bodin
et al, 2005; d’andrea et al, 2005; geisen et al, 2005; rieder
et al, 2005). our findings support the importance of the role

played by the genotype c.)1639g > a in the sensitivity to
 xxxd59xxx . the present study found that carrying the a
allele notably increased the odds of requiring a low  xxxd59xxx  dose to reach an inr within the therapeutic range.
more than 90% of the patients who required a low dose of
 xxxd59xxx  to maintain a therapeutic inr carried the a
allele, while this allelic variant was only present in <30% of the
patients who needed a high dose. this allele was present in 76%
of the patients in the medium dose group. our findings support
the notion that the association of  xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639g > a with
the sensitivity to  xxxd59xxx  is larger than that observed
with the cyp2c9 polymorphisms, as the probability of
requiring a low  xxxd59xxx  dose associated with carrying
the a allele was almost three times higher than the probability
associated with the cyp2c9 variants.
although the characteristics of the present study did not
allow us to determine how the variability differs for each
polymorphism, from our data it can be inferred that
genotyping
 xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639g > a
and
cyp2c9:
c.1075a > c can help to identify a high percentage of the
patients who can safely commence and maintain their
anticoagulation on a low dose of  xxxd59xxx  without risk
of experiencing a bleeding episode. the 10 patients who
simultaneously carried the a allele of  xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639a > g
and cyp2c9:c.1075a > c required a low dose of  xxxd59xxx  for stable anticoagulation. accordingly, among the 42
consecutive patients who entered the study because they
required a low dose of  xxxd59xxx , 40 of them carried at
least one of the two polymorphisms.
our findings could be relevant when applied to clinical
practice: as it has been suggested that the hyper-responsiveness
to oral anticoagulant is linked to high risk of bleeding at the
beginning of treatment, patients to be treated with  xxxd59xxx  and bearing the c.)1639g > a polymorphism of
 xxxg2418xxx  should start treatment with a reduced initial
‘loading’ dose in order to avoid over-anticoagulation and
subsequent bleeding risk, particularly if they also carry the
c.1075a > c variant of cyp2c9. an algorithm to calculate the
daily dose of warfarin taking into account the  xxxg2418xxx 
genotype has recently been proposed (sconce et al, 2005). the
present study could not build an algorithm because our
population was not randomly selected.
the higher sensitivity to coumarin derivatives in the
presence of the a allele of the  xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639g > a
polymorphism is probably due to a lower amount of  xxxg2418xxx 
in these patients, which would lead to a decrease in the
availability of  xxxd3522xxx -hydroquinone: recently, an association between low hepatic  xxxg2418xxx  mrna levels and
haplotypes of the  xxxg2418xxx  gene carrying the )1639a allele
has been shown, such patients being particularly sensitive to
warfarin (rieder et al, 2005).
this study has limitations: the sample size, although large
enough to draw conclusions, was not sufficient to avoid wide
ci; on the other hand, the patients were not randomly selected
but chosen according to predefined groups (i.e. low, medium
186

and high  xxxd59xxx  dose requirements). hence, our
results cannot be directly applied to the general population of
patients receiving anticoagulants. nonetheless, the strength of
the association between the  xxxg2418xxx :c.)1639g > a polymorphism and the  xxxd59xxx  requirements undoubtedly
underlines the importance of this genetic variant as a major
determinant of the sensitivity to  xxxd59xxx  in patients
under anticoagulant treatment.
in conclusion, for the first time the association between the
c.)1639g > a polymorphism of the  xxxg2418xxx  gene and the
 xxxd59xxx  requirement for stable long-term anticoagulation has been studied. the a allele increases the likelihood of
requiring a low dose of  xxxd59xxx , especially when the
c.1075a > c variant of the cyp2c9 gene is also present.
genotyping for both mutations should make it possible to
identify the vast majority of patients that are likely to require a
low dosage of  xxxd59xxx .
