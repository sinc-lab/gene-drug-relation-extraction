abstract
 xxxd3117xxx , an important drug in the treatment of tuberculosis, is used extensively despite its broad
effects on drug-drug interactions, creating serious problems. the clinical importance of such
interactions includes autoinduction leading to suboptimal or failed treatment. the concomitantly
administered effects of  xxxd3117xxx  on other drugs can result in their altered metabolism or
transportation that are metabolised by cytochromes p450 or transported by p-glycoprotein in the
gastrointestinal tract and liver. this review paper summarises recent findings with emphases on the
molecular mechanisms used to explain these broad drug-drug interactions. in general,  xxxd3117xxx 
can act on a pattern:  xxxd3117xxx  activates the nuclear  xxxg1598xxx  that in turn affects
cytochromes p450, glucuronosyltransferases and p-glycoprotein activities. this pattern of action
may explain many of the  xxxd3117xxx  inducing drug-drug interactions. however, effects through other
mechanisms have also been reported and these make any explanation of such drug-drug
interactions more complex.

introduction
multiple drug therapy is often used with a single patient.
for example, in individuals infected with hiv and tuberculosis, both anti-tuberculosis and antiretroviral agents
have to be used [1]. during treatment, drug-drug interactions occur when the presence of one drug affects the bioavailability of another through absorption, metabolism
or disposition, and therefore affects the treatment and
drug toxicity in the patient. the estimated incidence of
drug-drug interactions that have a clinical significance
ranges from 3% to 20%, depending on how many drugs
are taken [2]. these adverse reactions are sometimes lifethreatening. such adverse effects caused by drug-drug
interactions could be eliminated by more rational drug
use, in which patients receive their medications in appropriate doses [3]. to achieve this use, an understanding of

the mechanism of drug-drug interactions is important, so
that dosages can then be adjusted correspondingly.
 xxxd3117xxx  is an effective antibiotic against gram-positive
bacteria including mycobacteria, being frequently used
currently in the chemotherapy of tuberculosis along with
isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol/streptomycin
[4,5]. most patients can be cured with this, but some
present with suboptimal or failed treatment [6,7]. such
failures could, in part, be explained by well known autoinduction leading to decreased drug efficacy whereby the
drug stimulates its own metabolism into inactive metabolites and thus loses its effectiveness [8,9]. suboptimal or
failed treatment may also be arise from interactions with
other drugs and foodstuffs that affect the metabolism of
 xxxd3117xxx  [9-11]. for example, trikatu, a commonly used

demonstrated [21-28]. another important protein, p-glycoprotein, has also been shown to interplay with cyp3a4
in  xxxd3117xxx  inducing drug-drug interactions [29]. this
paper reviews these recent findings, focusing on the
molecular mechanisms of  xxxd3117xxx -inducing drug
metabolism.
history of  xxxd3117xxx -inducing drug-drug interactions
 xxxd3117xxx -inducing drug-drug interactions were
recorded 25 years ago, and those affected include anticoagulants, hypoglycaemia agents and contraceptives [3032]. the average elimination half-life of  xxxd2279xxx  was
decreased from 624 to 262 min and that of  xxxd3394xxx 
from 292 to 160 min following  xxxd3117xxx  treatment in
patients with cirrhosis or cholestasis [31].  xxxd3117xxx  at
600 mg/day caused about a 3 fold increase in propranolol's clearance [33]. during concurrent treatment
with prednisolone,  xxxd3117xxx  increased the plasma clearance of prednisolone by 45% and reduced areas under
curves (auc) by 66%, and these interactions have been
reviewed recently [19,34].

target genes activated by  xxxd3117xxx  via  xxxg1598xxx  and car.
 xxxd3117xxx  ( xxxd3117xxx ) induces nuclear receptors  xxxg1598xxx  and car that
in turn activate a set of target genes including phase i
enzymes such as  xxxg583xxx ,  xxxg586xxx , cyp2c9 and cyp3a4,
and phase ii enzymes such as ugts,  xxxg1073xxx  and phase iii
enzymes such as p-glycoprotein.  xxxg1598xxx  and car are also regulated by  xxxg1065xxx  and these target genes are also regulated by
 xxxd1682xxx , and dexamethasone (dex).
herb in ayurvedic medicine, can significantly reduce the
peak concentration of  xxxd3117xxx  probably by slowing
stomach emptying and gastrointestinal motility [12]. in
addition,  xxxd3117xxx  may also interfere with the metabolism of other concomitantly administered drugs [13].
thus,  xxxd3117xxx  has been used extensively in clinical
studies as a prototypical inducer of drug-metabolizing
enzymes and transporters, due not only to autoinduction
by itself or induction by other drugs and foodstuffs, but
also its broad effects on drug-drug interactions. many earlier reviews have discussed different aspects of  xxxd3117xxx 
metabolism and its effects on the actions of other drugs
[13-20]. however; application of molecular biology techniques has led to a rapid accumulation of new knowledge.
nuclear  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ) and constitutive
androstane receptor (car) have now been discovered and
their roles in  xxxd3117xxx -mediated drug-drug interactions

the  xxxd3117xxx -inducing drug-drug interactions were first
discovered by remmer (1972) to be caused by increased
levels of cytochrome p450 (cyp), a large group of hemecontaining monoxygenase isoenzymes encoded by a gene
superfamily [35-37]. total human cyp was markedly
increased by  xxxd3117xxx  in needle biopsy samples taken
from human liver. it was found that concomitant administration of  xxxd3117xxx  and oral contraceptives could lead
to failure of the antifertility effect of the latter [38]. further
studies elucidated the interaction to be caused by
increased estradiol metabolism [39,40]. increased metabolism of estrodiol in the presence of  xxxd3117xxx  was
caused by the induction of estrogen-2-hydroxylation,
which is catalysed mainly by cyp1a2 and also  xxxg575xxx ,
 xxxg577xxx  and cyp3a4 [41-43]. so far, many different cyps
have been identified. thus, each individual cyp is
assigned to a family, subfamily and number, so cyp1a2
stands for family 1, subfamily a, and isoform 2 [36].
within the same family, all cyp proteins share at least 40
% sequence identity in their amino acid sequence, and
within the same subfamily, at least 55% [37].
in 1998, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamilypxr was found and named, based on its activation by
both natural and synthetic c21 steroids (pregnanes) [1517].  xxxg1598xxx  was related to cyp3a4 and both are highly coexpressed in the liver and intestine.  xxxg1598xxx  is also activated by
cyp3a4 inducers including drugs such as  xxxd3117xxx , dexamethasone, indinavir, paclitaxel, pesticides such as transnonachlor, chlordane, endocrine disruptors such as
phthalic acid, nonylphenol and other environmental contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenols [21]. further experiments have demonstrated that  xxxg1598xxx

transcriptional
activation of  xxxd3117xxx  target genes
transcriptional activation of  xxxd3117xxx  target genes.  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ) binds with  xxxd3117xxx  in the cytoplasm and
enters into nucleus to form a heterodimer with  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rxr). the heterodimer binds to the promoter of a target gene to activate the transcription of its open reading frame (orf).

transcriptionally regulates cyp3a4. thus,  xxxg1598xxx  can bind to
cyp3a4 promoters to activate reporter genes, a process
that is disregulated in  xxxg1598xxx -null mice [19,44].
in addition to cyp3a4,  xxxg1598xxx  also upregulates a large
number of genes involved in xenobiotic detoxification,
including enzymes of phase i, ii and iii drug metabolism
(fig 1). these have been characterised by gene profiling
studies performed with pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile in
wild-type and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice [45]. the genes regulated by
 xxxg1598xxx  include those encoding cyp enzymes, p-glycoprotein, aldehyde dehydrogenases, udp-glucuronosyltransferases (ugts), sulfonyltransferases and glutathione-stransferases ( xxxg1073xxx ).
mechanism of induction of  xxxd3117xxx - role of  xxxg1598xxx 
the mechanism of  xxxd3117xxx -mediated induction of cyp
enzymes is now better understood. as mentioned earlier,
this induction is mediated by the activation of  xxxg1598xxx , which
functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor
[21,22]. thus, when a  xxxg1598xxx  ligand binds to  xxxg1598xxx , it in turn
activates transcription of cyp 3a4 and several other genes
(fig 2).

the mechanism of  xxxg1598xxx  in regulating cyp3a4 involves it
binding to response elements of the cyp3a4 gene that
confers transactivation.  xxxg1598xxx  binds to  xxxg590xxx  promoters
together with the 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rxr) as a
heterodimer to er6 (everted repeat with a 6 bp spacer)
elements [25,46]. in the cyp3a4 gene, two  xxxg1598xxx  elements
(distant and proximal) have been identified that are sepa-

rated by more than 7000 nucleotides. disruption of the
distant and proximal elements causes a 73% and 53%
decrease in the respective reporter activities. however, in
vitro binding studies showed that the proximal element
was preferred [42]. chromatin immunoprecipitation
experiments showed that the genomic fragment harbouring the proximal element was preferably precipitated over
the fragment containing the distant element in the
cyp3a4 gene [47]. the fact that cyp3a4 is disregulated in
 xxxg1598xxx -null mice further demonstrates a role for  xxxg1598xxx  in
cyp3a4 activation [44].
thus,  xxxd3117xxx  has been clearly identified as a  xxxg1598xxx  activator by binding to  xxxg1598xxx  [48]. it also modulates  xxxg1598xxx  binding to  xxxg1598xxx  elements of the cyp3a4 promoter [47].
studies by x-ray crystallography indicated the overall
architecture of  xxxg1598xxx  binding to  xxxd3117xxx  comprised 12 alphahelices that fold to form a hydrophobic pocket in the
lower portion of the protein [20]. the large volume of the
 xxxg1598xxx  ligand-binding pocket characterised by a smooth,
elliptical shape explains why  xxxg1598xxx  acts as a broad-specificity sensor of lipophilic xenobiotics.
another receptor,  xxxg1599xxx  (car),
is also involved in cyp3a4 transcriptional regulation.
car is a member of the steroid/retinoid/thyroid hormone
receptor superfamily. it has been demonstrated that car
can trans-activate cyp3a4 gene expression both in vitro
and in vivo [49]. the car response elements are also
bound by  xxxg1598xxx , indicating their interplay in cyp3a4
expression.

car has been demonstrated to cross-talk with  xxxg1598xxx , i.e.
they share some ligands capable of binding to each other's
dna response elements [44,45,49]. it was also confirmed
in chimeric mice with humanized mice liver in which
both human cyp3a4 mrna and protein production was
dramatically increased by  xxxd3117xxx  [50]. in receptor-null
mice,  xxxg1598xxx  and car regulate overlapping but distinct sets
of genes [45]. the significance of cross-talk could be that
car and  xxxg1598xxx  together compensate for the loss or malfunction of each other to a certain extent. however,
 xxxd3117xxx  has a much lower effect on car than  xxxg1598xxx  [45].
effect of  xxxd3117xxx  on cyps through  xxxg1598xxx 
cyps are mainly found on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membranes in liver hepatocytes and along the intestinal tract mucosal surface [51]. cyps play an important
role in protecting organisms from potentially toxic compounds, by their ability to biotransform lipophilic substrates of diverse structures into more water-soluble
metabolites that are subsequently excreted from the body
[37,52]. they are also essential for eukaryotic life because
of their roles in the metabolism of sterols such as cholesterol, bile acids,  xxxd2154xxx , prostaglandins, leukotrienes,
retinoids as well as biogenic amines [51,53].

these cyps are important in drug metabolism as they catalyse metabolic reactions involving thousands of substrates in over 60 different types of reactions [54].
 xxxd3117xxx  can induce many cyps including  xxxg582xxx ,
 xxxg583xxx , cyp2c and  xxxg590xxx  [51]. among the many different subsets of these enzymes, cyp3a4 is the most abundant, in both the liver and the intestinal tract. cyp3a4 is
responsible for the oxidative metabolism of a wide variety
of substrates, involving steroid catabolism and metabolism of foreign compounds, with many of the clinically
used drugs being substrates for cyp3a4. it is also a key
enzyme in chemical carcinogenesis in both the liver and
extrahepatic tissues [55].
the reactions catalysed by cyp3a4 include n-oxidation,
c-oxidation, n-dealkylation, o-dealkylation, nitro-reduction, dehydration and c-hydroxylation [55]. cyp3a4 is
the primary catalyst of steroid  xxxd1946xxx -hydroxylation [56].
these broad reactions are explained by the structure of the
cyp3a4 active site which recently has been characterised
by x-ray crystallography [57].
cyp3a4 is more efficiently induced than other cyps
[51,58-60]. in primary human hepatocytes, 20 microm
 xxxd3117xxx  increased cyp3a4 mrna by 14 fold, but
 xxxg583xxx  by only 2.1 fold [61]. cyp3a4 appears to be regulated transcriptionally by a variety of structurally diverse
compounds and hormones [46,62]. in cultured hepatocytes, triiodothyronine decreased cyp3a4 enzyme activity
as well as protein and mrna levels, while dexamethasone

http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/5/1/3

and  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  increased cyp3a4 gene expression
[63].
 xxxd3117xxx  is involved in drug-drug interaction by its
induction of cyps, especially cyp3a4, and cyp3a4
mrna is induced by  xxxd3117xxx  in blood mononuclear
and liver hepg2 cells [64-66]. the cyp3a4 gene has also
been isolated and cloned. a 20-bp region residing -150 bp
upstream of the transcription initiation site has been
shown to confer responsiveness to  xxxd3117xxx  [67]. the
relative potency in inducing cyp3a4 by the rifamycins is
 xxxd3117xxx  > rifapentine >  xxxd3116xxx  [10].
 xxxd3117xxx  can induce both gut (enterocytic) and liver
(hepatic) cyp, especially cyp3a4, and increase its own
metabolism (autoinduction), but the induced metabolic
pathway is still not clear [27]. in healthy volunteers,
repeated oral administration of  xxxd3116xxx  (450 mg daily
for 10 days) led to lower auc and minimal blood concentration (cmin) values, compared to the corresponding
theoretical values, with an unchanged half-life [26]. this
indicates induced metabolism, although it is unclear as to
which specific enzymes are involved.  xxxd3116xxx , its derivatives and metabolites, are likely to be metabolised by
cyps, particularly by cyp3a4 [29,68]. if cyps are
involved in  xxxd3117xxx  metabolism, how they act is not
clear [29].
there are marked individual variations in the expression
of cyp that affect the biological response (efficacy and/or
toxicity) of many drugs as well as individual responses to
cyp inducers [62,69]. in humans, a 10-fold variation
exists among individuals for  xxxd3117xxx  inducing cyp3a4
expression [70,71]. in the liver, substantial interindividual differences in cyp3a4 expression have been detected
that could not be explained by environmental factors
[70]. a similar situation was found in the intestine
whereby cyp3a4 mrna levels in biopsies of mucosa of
five healthy subjects varied by about 10 fold [71]. these
differences could in part account for interpatient differences in the oral bioavailability of cyp3a4 substrates.
it has been well demonstrated that  xxxd3117xxx -induced
cyp2c9 is mediated by  xxxg1598xxx  [72]. deletion and mutagenesis studies showed that the functional  xxxg1598xxx -responsive
element is located between -1839/-1824 base pairs
upstream from the translation start site previously identified to be car-responsive element, and essential for
 xxxd3117xxx  inducibility. a second car- responsive element located at -2899/-2883 also has a cooperative effect.
in addition,  xxxg1598xxx  and car activate  xxxg583xxx  by transcriptional regulation, although not all  xxxg583xxx  inducers activate  xxxg1598xxx  [73]. a phenobarbital-responsive enhancer
module (pbrem) has been identified, although for

human  xxxg583xxx , pbrem effects only a weak response to
 xxxg1598xxx  and car. a novel nuclear receptor response module
that strongly binds to both  xxxg1598xxx  and car has been
described and is known as the xenobiotic-responsive
enhancer module (xre) [74].
effect of  xxxd3117xxx  on glucuronosyltransferases through
 xxxg1598xxx 
 xxxd3117xxx  can induce udp-glucuronosyltransferase 1a
(ugt1a) that catalyses the glucuronidation of a wide
range of xenobiotics and endogenous substrates
[48,75,76]. ugt1a is regulated by many factors in a tissue-specific manner [77,78]. both  xxxg1598xxx  and car mediate
expression of ugt1a [79-81]. transgenic mice expressing
a constitutively active form of human  xxxg1598xxx  show a markedly increase of ugt activity [79]. a xre in the ugt1a
gene was thought to be responsible for this induction
[80]. the  xxxd3117xxx  mediated-ugt increase may lead to
increased clearance of steroids, heme, environmental toxins and drugs [79].
effect of  xxxd3117xxx  on p-glycoprotein through  xxxg1598xxx 
studies in humans have long indicated that drug transporters are involved in  xxxd3117xxx  hepatic and intestinal
uptake. p-glycoprotein is a plasma membrane-bound
drug efflux (multidrug resistance pump), a 170 kda phosphorylated and glycosylated protein, 1280 amino acids
long, which consists of two homologous halves of 610
amino acids joined by a flexible 60 amino acid linker [82].
p-glycoprotein belongs to the atp binding cassette superfamily of transport proteins encoded by the multidrug
resistance genes (mdr) and was found primarily in drugeliminating organs, including the kidney, liver, brain,
intestinal lumen, testes, adrenal gland, pregnant uterus,
tumour cells and epithelial cells [83,84]. they play an
important role in drug absorption and disposition, as a
biological barrier by extruding toxins and xenobitics from
cells rather than by enhancing the excretion of drugs from
hepatocytes and renal tubules. human p-glycoprotein
plays an important role in drug efflux through these barriers. recent paired human tissue studies have shown pglycoprotein and cyp3a4 protein contents in intestine
were higher than in liver, which might indicate an important role for the intestine in drug metabolisms [85].

should the p-glycoprotein be induced by  xxxd3117xxx , for
example, then the drug's therapeutic usefulness will
decline as more drugs are pumped out of the cells. p-glycoprotein has only recently been identified and thus the
potential risk of p-glycoprotein-mediated drug interactions has probably been underestimated in the past. many
drug interactions have been shown to involve both p-glycoprotein and cyp3a4 due to overlapping substrate specificity between them, and similarities in their inhibitors and
inducers, as for example, with the coinduction of cyp3a4

http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/5/1/3

and p-glycoprotein by  xxxd3117xxx  in human ls180 colon
carcinoma cells [86]. furthermore, p-glycoprotein can
control drug access to intracellular cyp3a4 through
repeated cycles of drug absorption and efflux, as demonstrated by the studies with cyclosporine, a p-glycoprotein
and cyp3a4 inhibitor and  xxxd1975xxx , a p-glycoprotein
inhibitor only [23]. after inhibition of  xxxd1975xxx , k77, a
substrate for p-glycoprotein and cyp3a4, accumulated in
the cell and metabolism was increased, but  xxxd2092xxx , a
substrate of cyp3a4 but not p-glycoprotein was not
changed [23]. cyclosporine decreased the metabolisms of
both k77 and  xxxd2092xxx . in another study, inhibition of
p-glycoprotein increased both intestinal uptake and
blood concentrations of verapamil but with no changes in
its rate of metabolism [87].
 xxxd3117xxx  both induces p-glycoprotein expression and
reduces digoxin concentrations during concomitant therapy [88,89]. in healthy volunteers, oral administration of
digoxin with  xxxd3117xxx  showed lower plasma concentrations than in those without. this was less pronounced if
digoxin was given intravenously. correspondingly, p-glycoprotein content was 3.5 fold higher after  xxxd3117xxx 
treatment [88]. any regulation is likely to take place at the
transcriptional level since increased mrna levels were
detected [90-92]. in healthy subjects, administration of
600mg  xxxd3117xxx  for 9 days upregulated p-glycoprotein
mrna synthesis [92].
the induction of  xxxg10xxx , a gene encoding p-glycoprotein,
is also activated by  xxxg1598xxx  which binds to  xxxg1598xxx  response elements located upstream of the  xxxg10xxx  gene [93]. only one
dr4 (direct repeat with a 4 bp spacer) motif (at about -8
kilobase pairs) was shown to be necessary for the induction by  xxxd3117xxx , although several other binding sites
were identified. it has been demonstrated in mouse
hepatoma cell culture and rats that dexamethasone
induces the expression of  xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg12xxx , with two
genes encoding for p-glycoprotein in the mouse [94,95].
other factors
 xxxg1598xxx  is also regulated by a hepatic nuclear factor
4alpha( xxxg1065xxx ), which regulates many genes preferentially
expressed in liver [22].  xxxg1065xxx  is stimulated by hepatic
maturation factors, such as oncostatin and matrigel, and
plays an important role in early embryogenesis [96]. in a
fetal hepatocyte primary culture system, inactivation of
 xxxg1065xxx  by infection with an adenovirus containing the
cre gene leads to suppression of  xxxg1598xxx  [97]. an  xxxg1065xxx 
antisense rna has been transducted into human hepatocytes, which resulted in the reduction of  xxxg1065xxx  protein
and cyp3a4 [98].

an  xxxg1065xxx  binding site has been characterised in the  xxxg1598xxx 
promoter that is necessary for expression of  xxxg1598xxx  in fetal

hepatocytes [97]. thus,  xxxg1065xxx  is identified as the key
transcriptional factor for  xxxg1598xxx . a specific cis-acting element of gene enhancer in cyp3a4 has also identified
which confers  xxxg1065xxx  binding and permits  xxxg1598xxx - and
car-mediated gene activation [22].
the molecular mechanisms that underlie transcriptional
activation of cyp3a4 are complex involving regulatory
factors other than  xxxg1598xxx  and car. these include glucocorticoid and  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  receptors. the cyp3a4 promoter
may also be regulated through mechanisms other than
 xxxg1598xxx  effects, including glucocorticoid-induced cyp3a4
gene expression, through the established  xxxg1598xxx -dependent
pathway and a  xxxg1598xxx -independent pathway [99]. disruption of a responsive element in the cyp3a4 proximal promoter for hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 and ccattenhancer binding protein alpha affects its induction by
glucocorticoids, dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, but
not that by  xxxd3117xxx .  xxxd1682xxx  has also been shown
to induce cyp3a4 independently of  xxxg1598xxx  [100-102].

http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/5/1/3

cyclosporine is mainly metabolized by cyp3a4 in
human liver [107]. dexamethasone-induction of
cyclosporine metabolism is inhibited by anti-cyp3a4
antibodies in vitro and so it is quite likely that rifampicininducing cyclosporine metabolism is mediated via
cyp3a4 although this has not yet been confirmed by in
vitro experiments [71].
simvastatin (cyp3a4)
simvastatin is used to treat hypercholesterolemia and is
metabolised to inactive metabolites by cyp3a4.
 xxxd3117xxx  has been shown to reduce its effective concentration while diltiazem, a cyp3a4 inhibitor increases its
concentration [108]. in healthy volunteers, 5 day pretreatment with  xxxd3117xxx  at a dose of 600 mg daily following a single 40 mg dose of simvastatin led to reduced
plasmid concentrations of simvastatin of 87 % compared
with the control [109]. thus, concomitant administration
of  xxxd3117xxx  and simvastatin can lead to greatly reduced
cholesterol lowering efficiency of simvastatin.

explanation of drug-drug interactions
some of the drugs affected by  xxxd3117xxx  are listed in
table 1. theoretically, any drugs or foods that affect the
activation or inhibition of  xxxg1598xxx , and/or cyp3a4 and/or pglycoprotein will interact. cyp3a4 catalyse the metabolism of more than 60% of all drugs currently in use including contraceptive steroids, immunosuppressive agents,
imidazole antimycotics and macrolide antibiotics.
"foods" such as grapefruit juice, black pepper inhibit
cyp3a4 so causing increased drug levels with resulting
therapeutic complications [89,103,104].

rosiglitazone (cyp2c9)
rosiglitazone is a novel thiazolidinedione antidiabetic
drug. its interaction with  xxxd3117xxx  has been studied in a
clinical trial [110]. when ten healthy subjects were
administered 8 mg of rosiglitazone after a 6 day pre-treatment of  xxxd3117xxx  at a dose of 600 mg daily,  xxxd3117xxx 
decreased the plasma concentration of rosiglitazone by
65% and its elimination half-life from 3.9 to 1.5 hrs.
because rosiglitazone is metabolised by  xxxg586xxx  and
cyp2c9, it is proposed that the induction of these cyps is
the basis for this interaction [110,111].

the drugs affected by or those that affect  xxxd3117xxx  have
been extensively reviewed elsewhere [6-11,13,14]. however, the mechanisms for these interactions are not well
studied, especially now that considerable progress has
been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms
of  xxxd3117xxx . the following examples are selected to represent the major clinically significant  xxxd3117xxx -inducing
drug-drug interactions mainly via the target genes
cyp3a4, cyp2c9,  xxxg583xxx  and p-glycoprotein, and these
are labelled with * in table 1.

warfarin (cyp2c9)
warfarin is an anticoagulant drug metabolized by
cyp2c9 to 7-hydroxywarfarin [72,112].  xxxd3117xxx 
increases the rate of clearance of warfarin, thus reducing
its effect. in a patient receiving concomitant treatment
with rifamycin and warfarin, a 233% increase in warfarin
dosage over 4 months was insufficient to attain a therapeutic level and more aggressive upward titration of dose
was needed [14,13]. this may be the result of  xxxd3117xxx 
induced cyp2c9, which in turn accelerated warfarin
metabolism.

cyclosporine (cyp3a4)
interaction of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine and
 xxxd3117xxx  is well documented. doses of cyclosporine had
to be increased about 3 fold to maintain its therapeutic
blood concentration when coadministrated with
 xxxd3117xxx  [105]. a case report has shown that intravenous  xxxd3117xxx  injection led to failure of bone marrow
transplantation
resulting
from
subtherapeutic
cyclosporine blood levels [106].

bupropion ( xxxg583xxx )
bupropion, an antidepressant drug, is metabolized by
 xxxg583xxx . bupropion is hydroxylased by microsomes containing cdna-expressed  xxxg583xxx  and the reaction is subject to 95% inhibition by  xxxg583xxx  inhibitory antibody
[114]. high interdividual variability is thought to be a
consequence of interactions between environmental and
genetic influences on  xxxg583xxx  gene function [115]. thus,
 xxxd3117xxx  induction of  xxxg583xxx  should lead to increased

page 7 of 11

annals of clinical microbiology and antimicrobials 2006, 5:3

bupropion metabolism, but no data are available to support this view.
digoxin (p-glycoprotein)
clinical observations have shown that digoxin serum concentration decreased considerably in patients who were
treated with  xxxd3117xxx . this is of special interest since
digoxin is generally considered to be renally eliminated
[116,117]. in healthy volunteers, co-administration of
digoxin and  xxxd3117xxx  orally resulted in plasma concentration of digoxin being much lower during  xxxd3117xxx 
treatment. however, the effect was less pronounced after
intravenous administration of digoxin [88].

http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/5/1/3

aspects of the molecular mechanism including how
 xxxd3117xxx  activates  xxxg1598xxx  and modulates their binding to
the promoters of cyp3a4 and other target genes should
be explored. secondly, the characterisation of drugs
affected by  xxxd3117xxx  and elucidation of their mechanisms of interactions are urgently needed.

list of abbreviations
auc: areas under curves
car:  xxxg1599xxx 
cyp: cytochrome p450

the interaction is mainly mediated by p-glycoprotein in
the intestine and intestinal p-glycoprotein content
increased 3.5 fold on treatment with  xxxd3117xxx , which
correlated with the decrease in its plasma concentration
after oral administration of digoxin [88]. thus, induction
of p-glycoprotein could explain the  xxxd3117xxx -digoxin
interaction.

dr4: direct repeat with a 4 bp spacer

 xxxd3117xxx -inducing hepatotoxicity
 xxxd3117xxx  is very toxic to liver, this having been found
both in the treatment of tuberculosis and cholestasis
[128-130]. when it was used together with pyrazinamide,
a 5.8% incidence of severe liver injury was reported, 2.6%
with isoniazid and 1.1% alone [130]. the pathogenesis of
hepatotoxicity is poorly understood although limited evidence has been obtained. histopathological examination
showed dose-related hepatic necrosis, ballooning degeneration and inflammatory infiltratrates [130,131]. a possible explanation is the increased cyp related effects on
calcium homeostasis [132]. it may also be that via oxidant
stress, increased lipid peroxidation occurs [133]. in the
case when  xxxd3117xxx  and isoniazid are used together,
 xxxd3117xxx  may increase isoniazid toxicity though induction of cyps because acetyl-isoniazid from isoniazid is
converted to monoacetyl hydrazine, which is catalysed by
cyps to other hepato-toxic compounds. there were no
reports if nuclear receptors were involved in this pathogenesis.

mdr: multidrug resistance genes

conclusion
a common pattern for the molecular mechanisms of
 xxxd3117xxx -inducing drug-drug interaction is  xxxd3117xxx  â
 xxxg1598xxx /car â cyps, ugts,  xxxg1073xxx  and p-glycoprotein. the
possible pathways for  xxxd3117xxx  effects on other drugs are
summarised in table 1. however, other drugs may act in
a similar way to  xxxd3117xxx , or by other pattern as seen
with dexamethasone. therefore, how they act individually
is probably complex.
more studies are needed to further increase our knowledge of  xxxd3117xxx  induced drug-drug interactions. firstly,
