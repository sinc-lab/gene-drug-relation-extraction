abstract
the binding kinetics of several benzimidazole compounds were determined with recombinant tubulin from benzimidazole-sensitive and
-insensitive organisms. this study utilised the naturally occurring high efficacy of the benzimidazoles for the parasitic protozoa giardia
duodenalis and encephalitozoon intestinalis, and low efficacy with cryptosporidium parvum. direct kinetic analysis of the benzimidazole-␤tubulin interaction was performed using a fluorescence-based quenching method to determine the apparent association (kon ) and dissociation
(koff ) rate constants from which the affinity constant (ka ) was calculated. the binding kinetics were determined with recombinant ␣- and
␤-tubulin from the parasitic protozoa with several benzimidazole r2 -carbamate analogues. the affinity constant for the binding of several
benzimidazoles with ␤-tubulin from benzimidazole-sensitive protozoa was found to be significantly greater than binding to ␤-tubulin from
benzimidazole-insensitive protozoa. additionally, the high affinity of several benzimidazole derivatives (albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole) for monomeric ␤-tubulin and heterodimeric ␣␤-tubulin from benzimidazole-sensitive protozoa was also clearly demonstrated. the
affinity constants determined with ␤-tubulin from g. duodenalis and e. intestinalis also supported the observed in vitro efficacy of these
compounds. the binding characteristics of the benzimidazoles with the highest in vitro efficacy (albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole)
was reflected in their high association and slow dissociation rates with the ␤-tubulin monomer or dimer from benzimidazole-sensitive protozoa
compared with insensitive ones. benzimidazole-bound ␣␤-tubulin heterodimers also had a significantly lower rate of microtubule assembly
compared with benzimidazole-free ␣␤-heterodimers. the incorporation of benzimidazole-bound ␣␤-heterodimers into assembling microtubules was shown to arrest polymerisation in vitro although the addition of benzimidazole compounds to assembled microtubules did not
result in depolymerisation. these findings indicate that a benzimidazole-␤-tubulin cap may be formed at the growing end of the microtubule
and this cap prevents elongation of the microtubule.

the anti-protozoal activity of the benzimidazoles, which
were initially developed as anthelmintics, has been observed
in vitro against a number of parasitic protozoa including giardia duodenalis [1–4] and encephalitozoon intestinalis [5–7].
this activity has also been demonstrated in vivo for the treatment of giardiasis [8–9] and microsporidiosis [10–12]. g.
duodenalis and e. intestinalis are both significant opportunistic parasites [13,14] which are also recognised as significant

waterborne pathogens [14,15]. they cause different severities of gastrointestinal symptoms [14,16], which are generally self-limiting but can become life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals (e.g. transplantation, hiv-positive)
[17,18]. at present, the most effective therapy for both these
parasites is the benzimidazole group of compounds, particularly albendazole [3,9,12,19]. interestingly, several other enteric parasites have been found to be insensitive to the benzimidazole compounds, including cryptosporidium parvum
[20]. it remains unclear what the molecular basis of sensitivity to these compounds is in particular parasites.
the mechanism underlying the mode of action of the benzimidazoles has been most extensively studied with the parasitic nematode haemonchus contortus [21–23]. these studies
have resulted in the proposal that the benzimidazoles bind to
the ␤-tubulin monomer prior to dimerisation with ␣-tubulin
which blocks subsequent microtubule formation [24]. more
specifically, it has been proposed that the benzimidazoles
bind to a high-affinity binding site on the ␤-tubulin monomer
[25]. one of the limiting factors in further characterising the
binding kinetics of the benzimidazoles has been the lack of
techniques to either extract homogenous tubulin from protozoan parasites or produce correctly folded and biologically
active recombinant tubulin.
in order to address these problems and to further investigate the molecular basis of the mode of action of benzimidazoles in protozoa, we have utilised an e. coli-based protein expression system to produce biochemically active and
assembly-competent ␣- and ␤-tubulin from g. duodenalis,
e. intestinalis, and c. parvum [26]. the recombinant tubulin
produced by this method had a purity of greater than 95%
and was free of post-translational modifications (e.g. polyglycylation, polyglutamylation). when assembled into microtubules in vitro they were free of accessory proteins (e.g.
microtubule associated proteins), which made them ideal for
benzimidazole-binding assays.
in this study, the binding affinity of several benzimidazoles has been determined for recombinant tubulin in both a
monomeric and dimeric state. this analysis was performed
using a fluorescence quenching method based on measuring the amount of intrinsic fluorescence from tryptophan
residues. this fluorescence is blocked when drugs bind directly with or close to these amino acids. this technique has
been used by several investigators to determine the binding
kinetics of the anti-mitotic compounds colchicine [27–30]
and taxol [31,32] although more recently it has been applied
to leishmania tubulin to assay dinitroaniline binding [33].
the kinetic analysis involved determining the apparent association rate (kon ) and dissociation rate (koff ) from which the
association equilibrium constant (ka ) was calculated. the
rate and equilibrium constants were determined for a number
of benzimidazole compounds with recombinant ␣-, ␤-, and
␣␤-tubulin to investigate whether their differential efficacy
in vitro relates to binding to monomeric or dimeric tubulin.
the benzimidazole compounds used in this study were
r2 -carbamate analogues with the same basic structure of

1,2-diaminobenzene (fig. 1). these compounds were albendazole, albendazole-sulphoxide, fenbendazole, mebendazole,  xxxd2810xxx , and parbendazole.  xxxd3345xxx  was
also studied as a non-r2 -carbamate analogue (table 1). all
these benzimidazoles have previously been demonstrated to
have a broad range of activity against g. duodenalis [1–4]
and e. intestinalis [5–7], while being inactive against c.
parvum [20], and were therefore predicted to display selectivity of benzimidazole binding with ␤-tubulin from these parasites.

2. materials and methods
2.1. expression of protozoan tubulin in e. coli
the expression of ␣- and ␤-tubulin genes from g. duodenalis, e. intestinalis, and c. parvum has been previously described [26]. the recombinant tubulin was maintained in mes buffered saline (mbs) buffer containing
0.1 m 2-(n-morpholino)ethanesulphonic acid (mes) ph 6.5,
0.2 m nacl, 0.05% nan3 , with protease inhibitors 1 mm
phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (pmsf), 1 ␮m leupeptin,
and 0.5 ␮m pepstatin a. the protein samples were quantified using a bio-rad protein assay [34] and analysed by
sds-page and immunoblotting as previously described
[26].
2.2. dimerisation and polymerisation of recombinant
tubulin monomers
the recombinant tubulin monomers (5 ␮m) were
dimerised and polymerised in buffer containing 0.1 m mes

l.m. macdonald et al. / molecular & biochemical parasitology 138 (2004) 89–96

(ph 6.5), 1 mm mgcl2 , 1 mm ethylene glycol-bis-(␤aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n ,n -tetraacetic acid (egta), and
0.5 mm gtp. dimerisation was performed at 4 ◦ c for 30 min
and the progress and incorporation of both ␣- and ␤-tubulin
into the heterodimers was monitored by non-denaturing (native) and denaturing (sds) page and western blotted as described previously [26]. the gdp- or gtp-bound dimeric
tubulin was polymerised into microtubules using a previously described method [25,31,32] by incubation at 37 ◦ c
for 30 min and included a control sample with 5% dimethyl
sulphoxide ( xxxg1394xxx  so) and test samples with the benzimidazoles (0–200 mm) tested in quadruplicate. the addition of
the compounds to the polymerisation samples produced a final  xxxg1394xxx  so concentration of ≤5%. following the addition of
3.4 m glycerol, the samples were clarified by centrifugation
at 2500 × g for 15 min at 4 ◦ c using a beckman avanti j-30i
centrifuge. the pelleted microtubules were rinsed in mbs
buffer and analysed by sds-page and western blotting as
described [26].
to monitor the effect of the benzimidazole compounds on
polymerisation, microtubule assembly was performed with
increasing drug concentrations (0–200 mm, 10 mm increments) and aliquots were removed at 5 min intervals. the
inhibition of assembly was monitored by change in turbidity measured spectrophotometrically at 351 nm (shimadzu
uv-1201 spectrophotometer) and compared to control samples of recombinant ␣␤-tubulin ± 5%  xxxg1394xxx  so. all measurements were made in triplicate and each drug concentration
was tested in quadruplicate. to determine if the benzimidazoles de-polymerise assembled microtubules, they were also
added at high molar concentrations (1 m) to microtubules
assembled as described above. any change in turbidity accompanying microtubule disassembly was monitored spectrophotometrically at 351 nm.
2.3. determination of benzimidazole binding kinetics
stock solutions of the benzimidazoles, albendazole,
albendazole-sulphoxide, fenbendazole, mebendazole,  xxxd2810xxx , parbendazole, and  xxxd3345xxx  (smithkline
beecham pharmaceuticals) were prepared in 100%  xxxg1394xxx  so.
the amount of binding by the benzimidazoles to ␣-, ␤-,
and ␣␤-tubulin (2 ␮m) from g. duodenalis, e. intestinalis,
and c. parvum was measured following incubation at 37 ◦ c
for 30 min. the kinetics of benzimidazole binding to tubulin were studied at 37 ◦ c under pseudo-first-order conditions
where the benzimidazoles were present in a large excess over
tubulin. initial measurements were made at 5-, 10-, 15- and
20-fold molar excess of each benzimidazole to determine
that a 10-fold benzimidazole excess was sufficient with 2 ␮m
tubulin to obtain pseudo-first-order conditions. specifically,
to determine the association rates tubulin monomers or heterodimers (2 ␮m) in mbs buffer were incubated with different benzimidazoles (0–20 ␮m) or 5%  xxxg1394xxx  so (negative
control) at 37 ◦ c for 30 min in quadruplicate. aliquots were
removed at 5 min intervals over the 30 min period for fluores-

cence analysis. the rate of dissociation of each benzimidazole from ␤-tubulin was determined using benzimidazole-␤tubulin complexes, which had attained a steady-state of binding as assessed by spectrofluorometry. the dissociation constants were determined by measuring the time-dependent increase in fluorescence from the tubulin–benzimidazole complexes as the different benzimidazoles were released from
their binding sites following a 200-fold-dilution of the complex in mbs buffer [27,29,30]. dissociation curves were plotted and analysed using non-linear regression to determine the
dissociation constant (koff ). this analysis also accounted for
the proportion of tubulin–benzimidazole complexes that did
not dissociate after 15 min.
all the fluorescence measurements were performed using a perkin-elmer luminescence spectrometer ls50 with an
excitation wavelength of 280 nm and emission wavelength
of 340 nm (initially tested over 300–400 nm range). the fluorescence measurements were corrected for inner-filter effects according to the method described by mertens and kagi
[35] as
fcorr = fobs 21 (antilog(a280 + a320 ))
where fobs and fcorr are the observed and corrected fluorescence values and a280 , a320 are the absorbances at the
excitation and emission wavelength, respectively. the association kinetics were analysed by mono-exponential and biexponential fits and based on the lowest chi2 -value and spread
of residuals the best fit was mono-exponential. the association and dissociation data was analysed using a non-linear
curve fitting program (prism, graphpad software) and a onesite binding equation. the association rate (kon ) was calculated from the change in fluorescence (fmax − ft ) taking into
account the rate of change in fluorescence following the addition of the benzimidazoles and these results were graphed
semi-logarithmically against time.
(fmax − ft ) = ae−kon t
where fmax is the maximum protein fluorescence, ft is the
protein fluorescence at time t, a is the amplitude of the binding phase, kon is the apparent association constant at time t.
the apparent association constant (kon ) for each benzimidazole tested was calculated as
kon =

alpha
[benzimidazole]

where alpha is the slope of the semi-logarithmic binding plot
and [benzimidazole] is the benzimidazole concentration. the
equilibrium association constant/affinity constant (ka ) was
obtained from the ratio of the association (kon ) and dissociation (koff ) rates.

3. results
3.1. effect of benzimidazole compounds on tubulin
ﬂuorescence
all the benzimidazole compounds tested (fig. 1; table 1)
quenched the tryptophan fluorescence intensity of g. duodenalis ␤-tubulin in a benzimidazole-specific manner (fig. 2).
these initial fluorescence results also indicate that the amount
of quenching by each of the benzimidazoles ranged from
maximal quenching (albendazole) to minimal quenching ( xxxd3345xxx ) compared with unbound tubulin. similar results
were obtained with e. intestinalis ␤-tubulin (table 4). the
relative difference in fluorescence quenching between giardia and cryptosporidium ␤-tubulin reflects the low affinity or
amount of binding by the benzimidazoles tested with tubulin
from the benzimidazole-insensitive c. parvum (table 2).
the semi-log arithmetic plot (fig. 3) demonstrates that
each benzimidazole binds with recombinant g. duodenalis
␤-tubulin in a monophasic manner although with different

respectively. albendazole-sulphoxide,  xxxd2810xxx , and
parbendazole produced kon values of 4.97 × 107 , 4.28 × 107 ,
and 3.59 × 107 m−1 s−1 , respectively. the lowest-affinity
benzimidazole tested was  xxxd3345xxx  which had an association rate of 4.23 × 104 m−1 s−1 . these results indicate
there was a significant difference in the association rates between the highest and lowest affinity benzimidazoles (alpha =
0.05, tvalue 7.5 > t0.05,3 2.353). similar results were obtained
with recombinant e. intestinalis ␤-tubulin (table 4).
the average association constants (kon ) for albendazole
with ␣-, ␤-, and ␣␤-tubulin from g. duodenalis, e. intestinalis, and c. parvum were also determined (table 2).
these results clearly illustrate the high affinity of albendazole for monomeric ␤-tubulin and heterodimeric ␣␤tubulin from the two benzimidazole-sensitive parasites, g.
duodenalis and e. intestinalis. the association constants
for g. duodenalis and e. intestinalis ␤-tubulin or ␣␤tubulin were 109 m−1 s−1 compared with 104 m−1 s−1 for
the benzimidazole-insensitive c. parvum. these results also
indicate that albendazole has a very low binding affinity
(103 m−1 s−1 ) for ␣-tubulin from all three parasites.
the dissociation rate of the benzimidazole–tubulin complexes was determined by measuring the increase in intrinsic
tubulin fluorescence following release of the benzimidazoles
from the benzimidazole–tubulin complexes as a result of a
200-fold dilution of the complexes in mbs buffer. the dissociation rate was measured as an increase in relative fluorescence values as a result of a decrease in the quenching effect
from the dissociating benzimidazole compounds which occurred in a benzimidazole-specific manner. this method has
been used previously to determine the dissociation kinetics
of colchicine analogues from colchicine–tubulin complexes
[27,29,30]. the resulting dissociation curves (fig. 4) were
used to determine the dissociation rates (koff ) with ␤-tubulin
from g. duodenalis (table 3), e. intestinalis (table 4), and
c. parvum (table 5). the rate of dissociation (koff ) was 17.6,
16.1, or 15.3 s−1 (g. duodenalis) and 17.1, 16.5, or 17.6 s−1

93

(e. intestinalis) for albendazole, fenbendazole, and mebendazole, respectively.
the benzimidazoles albendazole-sulphoxide,  xxxd2810xxx , parbendazole had comparatively slower dissociation
rates of 19.8, 21.3, or 21.0 s−1 (g. duodenalis) and 23.7,
21.5, or 24.2 s−1 (e. intestinalis). the lowest affinity benzimidazole,  xxxd3345xxx , had a dissociation rate of 32.5 s−1
(g. duodenalis) and 23.7, 21.5, or 24.2 s−1 (e. intestinalis),
respectively. these results indicate that the rate of dissociation (koff ) for all the benzimidazole compounds was inversely
proportional to the binding affinity (kon ) with the highest dissociation rate being observed with the lowest affinity benzimidazole,  xxxd3345xxx . conversely, the slowest dissociating
benzimidazoles were albendazole, fenbendazole, and mebendazole, which had the highest apparent association rates of
the compounds tested.
3.2. comparative binding afﬁnities of benzimidazoles
with protozoan tubulin
to investigate the relationship between the strength of
binding to tubulin and the chemical nature of the benzimidazole compound, the affinity constant (ka ) was calculated by
the ratio of the association (kon ) and dissociation (koff ) rates.
the association constant for each benzimidazole compound
tested with ␤-tubulin from g. duodenalis (table 3), e. intestinalis (table 4), and c. parvum (table 5) were determined.
using this method, there was a clearly identifiable high affinity (ka > 107 m−1 ) of the benzimidazole compounds with
␤-tubulin from g. duodenalis and e. intestinalis, which was
not observed with c. parvum. in considering the affinity constant of the benzimidazoles tested with ␤-tubulin from the
sensitive organisms, g. duodenalis and e. intestinalis, there
was no significant difference between the affinity rates for any
of the benzimidazoles (alpha = 0.05, tvalue 1.914 < t0.05,3 2.353).
however, when the affinity constants of the benzimidazoleinsensitive c. parvum was compared with those of g. duodenalis or e. intestinalis, all the benzimidazoles tested had a
significantly lower affinity for c. parvum ␤-tubulin (alpha =0.05,
tvalue 42.9 > t0.05,3 2.353).
the differential affinity of the benzimidazole derivatives
was used to distinguish them as having either a high-,
medium-, or low-affinity for ␤-tubulin, which was

observed between the two benzimidazole-sensitive organisms (tables 3 and 4) and was not observed with c. parvum
(table 5). in this way, albendazole, fenbendazole, and mebendazole were regarded as high-affinity benzimidazoles with
ka values of 107 m−1 with g. duodenalis and e. intestinalis. lower affinities were observed with albendazolesulphoxide,  xxxd2810xxx , and parbendazole (g. duodenalis
and e. intestinalis ka 106 m−1 ), which were termed mediumaffinity benzimidazoles.  xxxd3345xxx  was regarded as a
low-affinity benzimidazole compared with the six other compounds as it had a ka value of 103 m−1 (g. duodenalis) and
104 m−1 (e. intestinalis). the trend in binding affinities was
observed for monomeric ␤-tubulin from g. duodenalis and
e. intestinalis but not c. parvum for which very low binding
affinities were determined (ka 102 m−1 ) for all the benzimidazoles tested.
3.3. inhibition of microtubule assembly by
benzimidazole compounds
the recombinant ␣- and ␤-tubulin monomers from all
three parasites were dimerised and the ␣␤-tubulin heterodimers polymerised to form microtubules. the effect of
the benzimidazoles on the amount of polymerisation or microtubule assembly was monitored spectrophotometrically
over a 30-min period (fig. 5). with g. duodenalis and e.
intestinalis ␣␤-tubulin, the highest affinity benzimidazoles
(albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole) had the greatest
inhibitory effect on polymerisation compared with the lower
affinity benzimidazoles (albendazole-sulphoxide,  xxxd2810xxx , and parbendazole). the lowest affinity benzimidazole
( xxxd3345xxx ) had the least effect on polymerisation, particularly during the initial 10-min assembly phase.
the microtubule assembly results for g. duodenalis were
not significantly different to those of e. intestinalis. conversely, none of the benzimidazoles tested significantly reduced the rate of assembly of c. parvum microtubules (results
not shown). with c. parvum ␣␤-tubulin all seven benzimidazoles tested reduced the final amount of microtubules assembled by 5–10% without affecting the rate at which maximum

assembly occurred (i.e. slope of assembly phase, 3–10 min).
significantly, when excess molar concentrations of albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole were added to microtubules
assembled in the absence of benzimidazoles, there was no
decrease in turbidity or absorbance indicating they did not
de-polymerise the microtubules under these conditions.

4. discussion
the mechanism underlying the activity of the benzimidazole compounds against parasitic protozoa was investigated in this study. the binding affinities of several benzimidazole r2 -carbamate analogues were determined with
monomeric ␣- or ␤-tubulin and heterodimeric ␣␤-tubulin
from benzimidazole-sensitive (g. duodenalis, e. intestinalis)
or benzimidazole-insensitive (c. parvum) organisms. this
study identified two important aspects of the mechanism
of action of the benzimidazole analogues in these parasites. firstly, regardless of the chemical composition of
the benzimidazole compound tested, they have an indistinguishable affinity for monomeric ␤-tubulin and dimeric
␣␤-tubulin of benzimidazole-sensitive organisms. secondly,
they have a demonstrably higher affinity for ␤-tubulin from
benzimidazole-sensitive organisms when compared with a
benzimidazole-insensitive organism.
interestingly, the r2 -derivatives tested in this study produced distinctive binding affinities with g. duodenalis and
e. intestinalis recombinant ␤-tubulin. the affinity constant
(ka ) divided the benzimidazoles tested into high-affinity
(albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole), medium-affinity
(albendazole-sulphoxide,  xxxd2810xxx , parbendazole), or
low-affinity ( xxxd3345xxx ) derivatives. the binding affinities determined in this study also reflected the in vitro efficacy of these compounds against g. duodenalis [1–4], e.
intestinalis [5–7], and c. parvum [20]. the high-affinity (albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole) and medium-affinity
(albendazole-sulphoxide,  xxxd2810xxx , parbendazole) benzimidazoles have also been reported to have the highest efficacy against g. duodenalis with ic50 values between 50

and 160 mg/ml [2,4] and e. intestinalis with ic50 values between 1 and 10 ng/ml) [6,7]. these binding constant results,
therefore, suggest that at least some part of their efficacy is
due to their differential binding affinity for ␤-tubulin which
is related to the chemical group present in the r2 side-chain
of the benzimidazole derivative.
the relationship between the association (kon ) and dissociation (koff ) rates of these benzimidazole derivatives was
demonstrated to be inversely proportional. this suggests that
the lower in vitro efficacy of the rapidly dissociating benzimidazoles (albendazole-sulphoxide,  xxxd2810xxx , parbendazole, and  xxxd3345xxx ) may be partly due to their inability
to form stable benzimidazole-␤-tubulin complexes with the
converse being true of the higher efficacy benzimidazoles (albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole). this relationship is
also reflected in the effect each benzimidazole was found to
have on the polymerisation of ␣␤-heterodimers into microtubules. one of the proposed mechanisms of action of the
benzimidazoles is through binding to the microtubule, which
destabilises the lattice structure of the tubule, subsequently
resulting in its disintegration via depolymerisation [36].
the findings of this study partially support this model although via a different mechanism. the addition of the different benzimidazoles to assembling ␣␤-tubulin heterodimers
had a benzimidazole-dependent effect on both the rate and
amount of microtubules assembled for the benzimidazolesensitive parasites. that is, the highest affinity benzimidazoles (albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole) decreased
both the rate and amount of microtubule assembly, which
was observed to decrease with the medium- and low-affinity
derivatives. the benzimidazoles were also observed to inhibit the assembly of g. duodenalis and e. intestinalis microtubules (albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole) while
having no demonstrable effect on the polymerisation of c.
parvum heterodimers. similar findings have been reported
with albendazole and recombinant ␣␤-tubulin from h. contortus [37] although studies with mebendazole have suggested a different mechanism of action in h. contortus [38]
to the mechanism of action in the organisms utilised in this
study.
the microtubule assembly assay also demonstrated that
none of the benzimidazole compounds tested were able to
depolymerise assembled microtubules although these tubules
were naturally depolymerised by increasing the assembly
temperature above 37 ◦ c. this indicates that whilst the
microtubules were capable of depolymerisation this was
not promoted or favoured by the presence of the benzimidazole derivatives tested. these results indicate that the
benzimidazole-binding site on ␤-tubulin from sensitive protozoa is located at or near the inter-heterodimer interface as
the presence of the benzimidazoles is sufficient to arrest or
inhibit microtubule assembly.
taken together, this study of the in vitro binding kinetics
provides a model of benzimidazole/␤-tubulin binding which
has not been clearly identified previously. this is particularly
true when considering the molecular basis of benzimidazole-

95

sensitivity and -insensitivity. the results of this study indicate that a benzimidazole-␤-tubulin cap may be formed at
the growing or assembling ends of the microtubules and this
cap prevents elongation or polymerisation of the microtubule.
whether the inhibition of assembly is due to steric hindrance,
blockage of gtp hydrolysis, or another mechanism is unclear from this study. the model proposed by this study is
that the benzimidazole binding site on ␤-tubulin involves a
region where the amino acid residues are different between
benzimidazole-sensitive protozoa, such as g. duodenalis and
e. intestinalis, and insensitive protozoa, such as c. parvum.
these results also indicate that it is likely all the benzimidazoles tested interact with the same binding site on ␤-tubulin
but the strength of this binding is partially dependent on the
chemical composition of the r2 group of the benzimidazole
derivatives.
