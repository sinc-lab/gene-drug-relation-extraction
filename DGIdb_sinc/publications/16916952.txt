the decapeptide sequence of gnrh-ii is conserved in all
jawed vertebrate species studied to date. new data for cattle
(bos taurus) indicates a gene encoding gnrh-ii decapeptide
possessing arginine (codon: cgg) rather than tryptophan
(tgg) at position three in the mature peptide. this substitution is unique. we confirmed the dna sequence after cloning
part of the bovine prepro-gnrh-ii gene. bovine gnrh-ii peptide was synthesized and pharmacologically characterized. it
did not bind to  xxxd2226xxx  receptors expressed in different types of cell nor did it exhibit agonist or antagonist
properties on types i or ii gnrh receptors expressed in cos-7
cells. bovine primers facilitated cloning of ovine gnrh-ii
dna. a premature stop codon (tga) replaces the expected
tryptophan codon at position seven of gnrh-ii in sheep dna.
thus, both species possess prepro-gnrh-ii genes encoding

l

ike other mammals, cattle possess a hypothalamicpituitary gnrh system composed of  xxxd2226xxx  decapeptide hormone and type i gnrh receptors involved in the
regulation of gonadotrophin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland (1, 2) (genbank aj621497). various details of
the physiological response to exogenous gnrh have been
studied in animals over more than 30 yr, and different applications for gnrh analogs have been developed for use in
veterinary medicine (3). in agricultural management of beef
and dairy cows, the application of  xxxd2226xxx  analogs to manipulate estrus, fertility, and ovarian pathologies has been
explored (4 –7).
furthermore, the possible occurrence of different gnrh
peptides in mammals, in addition to classically described
 xxxd2226xxx , has been a focus of investigation since the discoveries of gnrh-ii in chicken and gnrh-iii in salmon (8 –11).
the gene encoding gnrh-ii decapeptide has subsequently
been studied in certain mammals but not in cattle. coding
sequences for gnrh-iii have not been identified in
mammals.
gnrh-ii decapeptide differs from mammalian  xxxd2226xxx 
at three positions: codons specify qhwshgwypg vs.
qhwsyglrpg in the two genes, respectively. both mature
peptides contain n-terminal  xxxd3052xxx  and c-terminal

inactive peptides, as previously described for chimpanzee
gnrh-ii. the updated bovine type ii  xxxg931xxx  gene
sequence revealed inactivation by frame shifts, premature
stop codons, and nucleotide changes specifying nonconservative replacement of amino acid residues, similar to inactivation of sheep type ii  xxxg931xxx . spliced rna transcripts from the disrupted receptor gene were not detected in
bovine pituitary. in contrast, bovine prepro- xxxd2226xxx  and type
i  xxxg931xxx  genes are intact, encoding well-conserved
protein sequences. these findings, and previous descriptions
of inactivation of the human type ii  xxxg931xxx  and deletions of prepro-gnrh-ii and type ii  xxxg931xxx  in laboratory rodents, suggest the gnrh-ii system has been replaced by the  xxxd2226xxx  system or is redundant in certain
mammals. (endocrinology 147: 5041–5051, 2006)

 xxxd149xxx , and they possess different conformations in
solution (12). they bind with different affinities to gnrh
receptor isoforms (types i and ii gnrh receptors in mammals) (12). the type i  xxxg931xxx  binds  xxxd2226xxx  with
higher affinity than gnrh-ii, and the type ii  xxxg931xxx 
has higher affinity for gnrh-ii.
the progress of genome sequencing projects and the targeted cloning of gnrh precursor genes and gnrh receptors
revealed retention of different gnrh system gene complements in certain animal species (13). however, the available
genetic data remain incomplete for many species, and therefore, the scope for functional interactions between different
gnrh peptides and  xxxg931xxx  isoforms in vivo is not
fully understood. discrepancies in gnrh ligand and gnrh
receptor nomenclature (between mammalian and nonmammalian vertebrates) (13) need to be reassessed (and hopefully
rectified) as the gnrh systems become characterized in more
detail in different vertebrates. we used the mammalian nomenclature described elsewhere (12).
in mammals, the gene for prepro-gnrh-ii has been characterized in humans, monkeys, and shrews. however, the
prepro-gnrh-ii gene has been deleted from the genome of
laboratory rats and mice (13), prompting reevaluation of
contradictory immunostaining data (14). in animals possessing two gnrh genes, the prepro-gnrh-ii gene is expressed,
in part, in anatomically distinct regions of the brain, compared with prepro- xxxd2226xxx  and special roles for gnrh-ii in
regulation of puberty, reproductive behavior, feeding, and
energy balance have been proposed (15–20).
in vitro, both types of mammalian  xxxg931xxx  can bind

 xxxd2226xxx  or gnrh-ii, and the peptides can elicit intracellular
signaling at either receptor (12). in vivo, histologically separate and histologically overlapping  xxxg1603xxx  networks, possibly linked by currently uncharacterized neurons, may exist in those species possessing more than one
type of ligand and receptor (19, 20).
surprisingly, the effects of gnrh-ii on bovine physiology
have not been reported in the literature, and recently the
presumed existence of a conserved and functional gnrh-ii
system in cattle has become uncertain because partial dna
sequence information indicated a premature stop codon in
the bovine type ii  xxxg931xxx  gene homolog (21), its
presumed cognate receptor.
although it is conceivable that gnrh-ii may act through
the type i  xxxg931xxx  in the absence of a conventional
type ii  xxxg931xxx  (22), the characterization of the bovine
gnrh-ii precursor gene is a necessary step to begin to understand the organization of the gnrh system in cattle.
therefore, we analyzed new information from the bovine
genome project for gnrh ligand precursor and  xxxg931xxx  dna sequences. two ligand precursor genes (one
encoding  xxxd2226xxx  and one encoding a gnrh-ii-like decapeptide) and two receptor genes (types i and ii) were identified
and characterized. a synthetic bovine gnrh-ii-like decapeptide (bovine gnrh-ii) was prepared and its receptor
binding and activation properties were investigated.
materials and methods
bioinformatics
the national center for biotechnology information and the ensembl
nucleotide and protein databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and
http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) were interrogated for  xxxd2226xxx  ligand precursor and  xxxg931xxx  sequence submissions
using on-line software tools as outlined below.
ovine  xxxd2226xxx  precursor (genbank u02517) and type i  xxxg931xxx  exon 3 (genbank l43841) dna sequences were used to identify
matching sequences in the ensembl bos taurus bovine genome database
using basic local alignment search tool software (blastn).
a bovine gnrh-ii precursor gene was identified using human
gnrh-ii precursor peptide sequence (genbank np_001492) to search
for short, nearly exact matches encoded in the bos taurus genome using
blastx software to translate bovine dna sequences and select relevant
matching peptide sequences.
the bovine type ii  xxxg931xxx  gene locus was identified using a
bovine expressed sequence tag (genbank av604131) to search the ensembl database for sequence matches. the identity and relative orientation of flanking genes was recorded for each gnrh ligand and gnrh
receptor locus using ensembl contigview. cross-species dna sequence
alignments were made using national center for biotechnology information blast bl2 software. polypeptide sequences were elucidated
using dna sequence-translation software (expasy translate, swiss institute of bioinformatics, geneva, switzerland) and multiple sequence
alignments were prepared using clustalw (european bioinformatics
institute, hinxton, cambridge, uk).

genomic dna, pcr amplification, cloning, and
dna sequencing
bovine genomic dna was purchased from novagen (madison, wi).
ovine genomic dna was prepared from soay sheep testis tissue provided by dr. g. lincoln (medical research council human reproductive sciences unit, edinburgh, uk) using standard proteinase k (sigma,
poole, uk) digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction procedures.
primers for pcr amplification of bovine gnrh-ii coding exon 1 were
synthesized by mwg biotech (london, uk): 5⬘-atg gga gca gcc
ctg cta tg-3⬘ and 5⬘-ggg ggc cta gga gga tgc tga gg-3⬘.

morgan et al. • gnrh-ii ligand precursors and  xxxg932xxx  genes

pcr was performed using easy-a dna polymerase (stratagene, la
jolla, ca) using standard buffer, 94 c denaturing incubation, 55 c
anneal, and 1 min extension at 72 c. pcr products were purified from
1% agarose-tris-acetate-edta gel slices by centrifugal elution in ultrafree-mc filter devices (millipore, bedford, ma) after electrophoresis.
dna size markers were a 100-bp ladder (promega, southampton, uk).
the dna was ligated into pcr4 sequencing vector (invitrogen, paisley,
uk) and transformed into escherichia coli top10 (invitrogen). individual
clones were picked, and plasmid dna was subjected to automated
sequencing using t3 and t7 sequencing primers.

rt-pcr, cdna cloning, and expression
construct preparation
rna was purified from whole bovine pituitary tissue (also provided
by dr. g. lincoln, edinburgh university, edinburgh, uk) after homogenization in tri-reagent (sigma). single-stranded cdna was generated
using random oligonucleotide primers (promega) and superscript reverse transcriptase following the manufacturer’s instructions (invitrogen). dna spanning the full-length reading frame encoding bovine type
i  xxxg931xxx  was amplified using specific primers tagged with
restriction endonuclease sites (5⬘-gat atc ggt acc gcc acc atg
gca aac agt gac tct cct gaa-3⬘ and 5⬘-agg cct tct aga
tta tag aga gaa ata tcc ata tat aag-3⬘) and easy-a dna
polymerase (stratagene). the purified pcr product was cloned into
pcr4. the dna sequence was confirmed using automated sequencing,
and the cdna was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector
pcdna3.1 (invitrogen).

peptides
 xxxd2226xxx , gnrh-ii, bovine gnrh-ii, his-5, and d-tyr-6-gnrh were
made using solid-phase synthesis and were purified using reverse-phase
hplc to more than 98% purity.

cell culture
cos-7 cells were prepared and transfected with  xxxg931xxx 
cdna-plasmid expression constructs as described elsewhere (23).
mouse l␤t2 cells were cultured on matrigel-coated plasticware (bd
biosciences, franklin lakes, nj) in dmem (sigma) containing 10% fetal
calf serum (paa laboratories gmbh, cölbe, germany).

 xxxg931xxx  ligand binding assay
whole-cell binding assays were performed using 125i-iodinated his-5,
d-tyr-6-gnrh, a tracer enabling sensitive binding assays (24). ten micrograms of peptide were labeled with 1 mci na125i using the chloramine t method (sigma) and purified using sephadex g25 chromatography (sigma). binding analyses were performed in triplicate.

inositol phosphate assay
production of inositol phosphate was assayed as described previously (25), using myo-d-[3h] inositol (75–90 ci/mmol, amersham, aylesbury, uk). assay measurements were performed in triplicate using
peptide concentrations in the subnanomolar to micromolar range.
binding and inositol phosphate assay data were analyzed using sigmaplot 7.0 software (systat software inc., point richmond, ca) or prism
software (graphpad, san diego, ca).

8. this sequence matches part of the 4.724 kb reported in
genbank aafc01538836.
the bovine  xxxd2226xxx  precursor gene is physically linked to
a gene encoding a  xxxg1232xxx  tetramerization domain protein (kctd-9) and to the gene encoding a protein
involved in cytokinesis (doc-5) (13) (see fig. 1a). the coding exons exhibit highest homology to the partial sequence for
sheep prepro- xxxd2226xxx  (genbank gon1_sheep, aaa03433,
u02517), and the bovine data contribute extra information required to construct models for the gene structure in these two
species. this includes details of the 5⬘ flanking region and the
23 codons preceding the decapeptide coding sequence (fig. 1b).
information concerning the exons and introns is contained
in the ensembl gene summary available on-line. a polyadenylation signal sequence (aataaa) occurs 367 bp 3⬘ to the
translation stop codon.
bovine gnrh-ii precursor gene

a gene encoding a variant of the gnrh-ii decapeptide
precursor was identified on a 3.98-kb genomic dna fragment (genbank aafc01572942). an ensembl contiguous
dna sequence (ensbtag 000 000 00825) shows that this
gene is physically linked to genes for 28s mitochondrial
ribosomal  xxxg1850xxx -26 (mrps-26) and receptor-type protein
tyrosine phosphatase-␣, as found with the gnrh-ii precursor gene in other mammalian species (13) (fig. 2a). the

mrps-26 translation start codon occurs only 314 bp downstream from the gnrh-ii precursor gene stop codon, suggesting that the genes overlap each other.
the bovine gnrh-ii precursor gene encodes the decapeptide, qhrshgwypg, rather than qhwshgwypg found
in all other vertebrate prepro-gnrh-ii genes characterized to
date. specification for an arginine residue at gnrh-ii position 3 (codon cgg) might have arisen as a single transition
mutation (t to c) from an ancestral tryptophan codon (tgg)
(fig. 2b).
the three coding exons for this gene are spread over almost 1 kb genomic sequence (fig. 2a), and splice donor and
acceptor sequences are well conserved, compared with sequences present in the human gnrh-ii precursor gene. further comparison of the bovine gene with the human homolog
(ensembl ensg 000 001 25787) indicates sequence similarities between the first two coding exons but divergence in the
third coding exon.
an early ensembl gene structure model (ensembl gene
identity no. ensbtag 000 000 00826) was generated ab initio
with genscan software (25). it suggested the bovine sequence equivalent to human prepro-gnrh-ii coding exon 3
may be divided into three smaller exons separated by two
very small introns of 4 and 1 bp, respectively. this is an
unlikely model. a more convincing model is that the reading
frame in bovine exon 3 terminates earlier than in the human

homolog, resulting in a slightly shorter gnrh-associated
peptide (see fig. 3).
the location of a polyadenylation signal motif (aataaa)
is conserved within the bovine and the human gnrh-ii
precursor-translated dna sequence rather than in the 3⬘
untranslated region.
the dna sequence of bovine prepro-gnrh-ii coding
exon 1 was confirmed by cloning and sequencing multiple
isolates of pcr-amplified bovine dna generated with a
high-fidelity proofreading thermostable dna polymerase
(easy-a; stratagene; see fig. 3a). all clones encoded
qhrshgwypg (genbank dq359716). the same oligonucleotide primers (as detailed above and indicated in fig. 2b)
were used to clone multiple isolates of sheep preprognrh-ii coding exon 1. dna sequences derived from both
strands of the plasmid clones were translated, and amino
acid sequences were aligned with other mammalian preprognrh-ii sequences. this revealed that the tryptophan codon at
position seven of gnrh-ii is replaced by a stop codon in sheep
dna, qhwshg*ypg (fig. 3b and genbank dq359717).
bovine type i  xxxg931xxx  gene

the type i  xxxg931xxx  was identified in a genomic
dna region spanning approximately 17.5 kb on bovine chromosome 6 (ensembl identification no. ensbtag 000 000
27542). the gene is flanked by genes encoding airway trypsin-like protease and a ubiquitin-activating enzyme, a linkage group observed in other mammals (fig. 4a) (13). details
are contained in ensembl ensbtag 000 000 00438. coding

exon 1 encompasses  xxxg931xxx  transmembrane domains 1– 4, over a total of 175 codons. the following intron
extends for 12.5 kb. coding exon 2 comprises 73 codons from
the end of transmembrane domain 4 to the middle of intracellular loop 3. the next intron is 3.5 kb and coding exon 3
contains 80 codons.
the sequence is highly conserved relative to previously
reported sequences (genbank no. gnrhr_bovin,
aac48857, u00934, np_803480, and caf21711). coding
exon 1 differed by four silent base changes from the sequence
reported in genbank u00934. coding exons 2 and 3 are
identical with genbank u00934. polyadenylation motifs
(aataaa) occur 97 and 184 bp 3⬘ to the translation stop
codon. the bovine receptor protein sequence exhibits 95%
amino acid similarity and 90% identity to the human type i
 xxxg931xxx .
bovine type ii  xxxg931xxx  gene

a gene encoding a type ii  xxxg931xxx  is located on
ensembl genescaffold_5442 (ensembl gene identity no.
ensbtag 000 000 08370) on bovine chromosome 3. it spans
5 kb and is flanked by genes encoding peroxisomal membrane protein 11␤ and rna-binding motif protein 8a (fig.
4a), as described in other mammalian species (13, 21, 26). the
ensembl receptor gene model generated ab initio by genscan suggested 14 coding exons, but this can be simplified
in view of the number of exons found in the homologous
gene in other species (i.e. three) and by considering the existence of three coding exons in type i  xxxg931xxx  genes.

fig. 3. a, dna from coding exon 1 of bovine and ovine prepro-gnrh-ii was pcr amplified and cloned into plasmid pcr4 (one undigested
plasmid and five ecori digests are shown after electrophoretic separation). the flanking gene mrps-26 is indicated. the dna fragment of
interest is arrowed. dna size markers are 100-bp ladder (promega). multiple clones were subjected to dna sequencing. b, alignment of
mammalian prepro-gnrh-ii amino acid sequences prepared using clustalw. the gnrh-ii peptide is boxed, and premature stop codons are
indicated with an asterisk. residues in the dashed box result from alternative splicing. the bovine sequence is derived from the ensembl database
and the ovine partial sequence is from genbank dq359717. other accession numbers are for human: gon2_human; chimpanzee: ensembl
ensptrt 000 000 24489; tree shrew: gon2_tupgb; musk shrew: gon2_sunmu; and possum: aaf07190.

thus, there are probably only three coding exons in the
bovine type ii  xxxg931xxx  gene homolog (see fig. 4). the
first coding exon is disrupted by a deletion of 2 bp, which
causes a frame shift in the region for receptor transmembrane
domain 3 (fig. 4c). this is a unique feature, although most
of the dna sequence is highly conserved relative to the
sheep type ii  xxxg931xxx  gene homolog (94% sequence
identity in this exon), including the splice donor sequence
(gtgagt).
further comparison with the sheep gene shows that 21 of
the 170 codons in the first exon are altered, with five silent
changes, 14 amino acid alterations, and two amino acid deletions (one deletion in the bovine sequence and one in the
sheep sequence, see fig. 4c). the dhq motif encoded in
intracellular loop 2, also present in the sheep sequence (26),

reflects divergence from the drq motif in primate type ii
 xxxg931xxx  sequences.
the intron sequence is highly conserved relative to the
sheep sequence (91% identity) and is of a similar length.
the splice acceptor sequence is completely conserved
(atctag).
there is an apparent premature stop codon in coding exon
2, as described previously (21), followed by a frame shift 32
codons downstream potentially caused by deletion of 1 bp in
the region encoding transmembrane domain 5. further analysis in this region showed that there is in fact a deletion of
13 bp relative to the sheep sequence (tctttctgaggcc in
sheep exon 2). correction of the frame shift by insertion of 1
bp would result in a 5-amino acid residue deletion in transmembrane domain 5 (fig. 4c).

human:  xxxg932xxx ; chimpanzee: xp_525214 and ag122659; macaque: gnrr2_macmu; african green monkey: gnrr2_cerae;
marmoset: gnrr2_calja; pig: np_001001639; and sheep: ay319519.

the sequence of the following intron is well conserved
(92% identity to the sheep sequence), but the splice donor
sequences are divergent, whereas the splice acceptor sequences are identical with the sheep (tcccag).
two premature stop codons occur in the third coding
exon, in the region encoding the cytoplasmic tail domain.
interestingly, the first stop codon (tga) is adjacent to the end
of transmembrane domain 7 and may have arisen from a
single base change in a codon for arginine (cga). the second
premature stop codon in this exon occurs 72 bp downstream
and may have arisen from mutation of a glutamine codon
(caa to taa). a frame shift occurs 12 bp downstream from
the second premature stop codon. this results in deletion of
two amino acid residues (fig. 4c) and may have arisen from
the loss of 4 bp. translation of the alternative reading frames
indicates that coding sequences for the c-terminal residues
(isitsi) have been lost, although the 3⬘ flanking region linked
to the rna-binding motif protein 8a gene is similar in length
to the sheep sequence.
when translated, the bovine type ii  xxxg931xxx  protein
sequence exhibits 80% similarity and 75% identity to the
marmoset type ii  xxxg931xxx , indicative of poorer conservation relative to the level of sequence conservation in the
type i gnrh receptors.
rt-pcr analysis of bovine pituitary rna demonstrated
expression of the type i  xxxg931xxx  gene, but spliced
transcripts from the type ii  xxxg931xxx  gene were not
detectable using primers targeting the coding exons (fig. 4b).

binding assays for bovine gnrh-ii peptide

cos-7 cells were transfected with expression constructs
for bovine or human type i  xxxg931xxx  or marmoset type
ii  xxxg931xxx , and binding assays were performed using
iodinated his-5,d-tyr-6 gnrh. unlabeled  xxxd2226xxx  or
gnrh-ii competed with binding of the radiolabeled ligand
most effectively at their respective cognate receptors, with
dissociation constants of 9.7, 1.8, and 0.9 nm, respectively
(fig. 5 a, d, and e). however, the bovine gnrh-ii peptide
could not effectively displace radiolabeled ligand binding
from either the bovine or human type i or marmoset type ii
gnrh receptors (fig. 5, c, f, and g), even when added at
micromolar concentrations. in addition, micromolar bovine
gnrh-ii did not displace tracer binding at the mouse type
i  xxxg931xxx  endogenously expressed at high level in the
gonadotrope cell line l␤t2 (fig. 6).
inositol phosphate assays for bovine gnrh-ii action

 xxxd2226xxx  and gnrh-ii elicited dose-dependent production
of tritiated inositol phosphate in cos-7 cells transiently
transfected with human type i  xxxg931xxx  or marmoset
type ii  xxxg931xxx  cdna expression constructs (fig. 7,

discussion

genes for two gnrh precursors and two gnrh receptors
are present in the bovine genome, and their arrangement
with respect to flanking genes is conserved relative to other
mammals (13). the structural organization of these genes is
incompletely described in the ensembl or genbank bovine

genome databases, and our bioinformatics results produced
an improved interpretation of the available dna sequence
data.
bovine prepro- xxxd2226xxx  and type i  xxxg931xxx  genes
are intact. however, analysis of the information contained
within the dna sequences for the bovine prepro-gnrh-ii
and the type ii  xxxg931xxx  genes raises questions concerning their functionality. the bovine prepro-gnrh-ii gene
encodes an unusual decapeptide containing arginine (arg) in
position 3 of the mature peptide, and the type ii gnrh
receptor gene is disrupted by frame shifts and premature
stop codons. these new data extend what is understood

about species-specific differences in the organization of the
gnrh system.
we confirmed the dna sequence for coding exon 1 of the
bovine prepro-gnrh-ii gene. the substitution of tryptophan
at position 3 (trp3) in bovine gnrh-ii by arginine is a unique
occurrence; it has not been described in any natural gnrhs
(12). conservative replacement of trp3 with a polar aromatic
tyrosine residue occurs naturally in guinea pig  xxxd2226xxx  (12,
27) and lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  (12, 28). position 3 is important for
 xxxg931xxx  activation, because d-trp3 gnrh analogs
behave as antagonists and replacement of trp3 with nonpolar phenylalanine produces gnrh analogs with low biolog-

ical activity (29). arg3 has not been described in the large
number of gnrh analogs synthesized, although replacement of position 3 with a variety of residues is associated
with loss of activity (29).
because substitutions of trp3 are used in gnrh antagonist
design, we contemplated that bovine gnrh-ii might be a
naturally occurring antagonist.
however, our data indicate that substitution of position 3
with arg prevents gnrh-ii binding to gnrh receptors. we
showed that bovine gnrh-ii has no binding or inositol phosphate stimulating activity at mammalian type ii or type i
gnrh receptors. bovine gnrh-ii did not bind to gnrh
receptors artificially expressed in cos-7 cells or  xxxg931xxx  endogenously expressed in specialized gnrh-responsive pituitary gonadotrope cells (mouse l␤t2).
in the absence of binding, we would not expect activation
of intracellular signaling. the bovine gnrh-ii peptide had

no ability to inhibit the stimulation of inositol phosphate
production by  xxxd2226xxx  or gnrh-ii at the type ii or type i
receptors (data not shown). considering these results it
seems unlikely that bovine gnrh-ii elicits or modifies alternative signaling events via conventional gnrh receptors.
further considerations suggest functional inactivation of
bovine gnrh-ii. for example, assuming the gene is expressed in bovine tissues, the position of the basic arg3 may
be expected to affect correct posttranslational cleavage of the
propeptide such that a decapeptide is not generated in vivo.
in addition, oligonucleotide primers based on the bovine
prepro-gnrh-ii gene were used to determine the dna sequence of part of the homologous sheep gene. significantly
there is a premature stop codon (tga) at position seven of
the region encoding the mature gnrh-ii peptide in sheep
(i.e. qhwshg*ypg). an identical truncated peptide sequence is encoded in chimpanzee dna (13) (see ensembl
ensptrg 000 000 13187). thus, in the absence of an intact
reading frame, it is unlikely that gnrh-ii is biosynthesized
in these species. therefore, considering their relatively close
evolutionary relationship, the data from sheep are consistent
with the likely functional inactivation of gnrh-ii in cattle.
loss of functional ligand through mutation is also consistent with coevolutionary loss of cognate receptor function.
using sequence alignment, we confirmed that the bovine
type ii  xxxg931xxx  gene is disrupted due to multiple
alterations relative to functional  xxxg931xxx  genes. also,
spliced rna transcripts derived from the bovine type ii
 xxxg931xxx  gene were not detectable in pituitary cdna,
suggesting receptor silencing in this tissue, in contrast to the
situation in marmoset pituitary, in which the type ii gnrh
receptor gene is expressed (30).
a major question is why a loss of functional gnrh-ii
and/or its cognate receptor has occurred in certain mammalian species, such as cattle, sheep, laboratory rodents,
chimpanzee, and man but not in others, such as the marmoset
(see table 1). it is possible that this loss represents a null
mutation in certain species or that other neurohormonal systems have replaced the ancestral role of gnrh-ii or its cognate receptor. perhaps  xxxd2226xxx  performs these functions in
certain species. interestingly, the prepro-gnrh-ii gene is
intact in jawed teleosts and amphibians (13), and receptors
phylogenetically similar to the mammalian type ii gnrh
receptor are functional in amphibians (13, 31). however,
whether one particular receptor isoform is functionally dedicated to recognition of gnrh-ii in these animals has not
been resolved (31, 32). analyses of the type ii  xxxg931xxx 
family, their evolutionary history, and functional adaptations are ongoing, including jawless teleosts in which the
status of the prepro-gnrh-ii gene homolog is unknown (28,
33–35).
the events leading to inactivation of the gnrh-ii system
during evolution are not understood. we note that point
mutations in separate tryptophan codons occur in the bovine
and ovine gnrh-ii precursor genes and perhaps targeting
the tgg codons may represent the simplest way of inactivating the gene. retention of the rest of the coding exons for
prepro-gnrh-ii in the bovine genome may be indicative of
close linkage to a functional flanking gene (mrps-26). we
have not undertaken phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide

in mammals, the biological effects of gnrh-ii within the
brain have been examined in female marmoset monkeys (36),
female shrews (15–17), and female mice (37). intracerebroventricular injection of gnrh-ii stimulates female reproductive behavior in each of these animals and is also associated
with decreased food intake in shrews and mice. the experimental data implicate a cognate receptor for gnrh-ii (i.e. a
type ii  xxxg931xxx ) as the site of action in each of these
species because  xxxd2226xxx  does not elicit the same response
and type i  xxxg931xxx  antagonists do not block the effects
of gnrh-ii. however, this conclusion with respect to the
mouse (37) must be questioned in the absence of genetic
evidence for the existence of a gnrh-ii system in this species
(13).
perhaps this paradox may be resolved when the neurotransmitter phenotype and the extent of synaptic connections
between neurons secreting gnrh peptide and those possessing gnrh receptors are better understood. in this respect, advances in genome sequencing projects should enable selection of animal models based on detailed knowledge
of the genetic variations in the organization of the gnrh
system (see table 1 for comparisons). for example, prelim-

inary findings suggest that prepro-gnrh-ii and type ii
 xxxg931xxx  genes may also be disrupted by reading
frame mutations in the rabbit and dog genomes (see ensembl
database). nevertheless, the data derived from our studies of
cattle and sheep should contribute to the further elaboration
of models addressing the neuronal regulation of reproductive behavior (38).
