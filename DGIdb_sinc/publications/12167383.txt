abstract
background:  xxxg2296xxx  a ( xxxg2296xxx ) has been shown to contribute to heart failure (chf) progression. aims: we
have tried to antagonise the detrimental effects of  xxxg2296xxx  on skeletal muscle apoptosis, by using thalidomide, a drug that inhibits
its biosynthesis. methods: chf was induced in 20 rats by injecting monocrotaline, which determines right ventricle (rv) failure.
after 2 weeks, when chf developed, 12 rats were treated with thalidomide 3.5.mgykg per day for 2 weeks. eight had saline and
served as chf controls. results: thalidomide failed to decrease  xxxg2296xxx  and its second messenger sphingosine (sph), but was
able to prevent the shift toward the fast myosin heavy chains. in the tibialis anterior muscle of the thalidomide group, the degree
of atrophy, the number of apoptotic nuclei and the levels of caspases, were similar to those of the chf controls. conclusions:
thalidomide, at the doses used in this study, which are the same employed for the treatment of tubercolosis, leprosy, aids and
cancer in humans, did not lower either  xxxg2296xxx  or sph and only marginally influenced the apoptosis-induced muscle atrophy. since
other  xxxg2296xxx  blockers are under investigation for improving the clinical status of patients with chf, the present data could be
relevant in the design of randomised clinical trials in humans.

1. introduction
since the first observations of elevated levels of
 xxxg2296xxx  a ( xxxg2296xxx ) in patients with
heart failure (chf) w1x, there have been several speculations on the role played by this cytokine in worsening
the clinical syndrome.  xxxg2296xxx  could have a cytotoxic
effect on the heart by inducing myocyte apoptosis w2x
or by decreasing cardiac contractility w3x. enbrel (etanercept), a soluble p75  xxxg2296xxx  receptor fusion protein,
can lower biologically active  xxxg2296xxx  and improve the
functional status of chf patients w4x. several other
substances have been used to block  xxxg2296xxx  in various
diseases, such as infliximab in rheumatoid arthritis,
 xxxd2880xxx  in dilated cardiomyopathies w5x, and thalidomide in tuberculosis, aids and leprosy w6x.

 xxxg2296xxx  may trigger apoptosis, the cause of skeletal
muscle atrophy, one of the most important determinants
of exercise capacity (ec) w7,8x in patients and animals
with chf.  xxxg2296xxx  may induce cardiac contractility
depression w9x and skeletal muscle apoptosis through
sphingosine (sph) a second messenger released by
cardiac myocytes when  xxxg2296xxx  binds to their membrane
w2,10x. sph is responsible for many of the cytotoxic
effects of  xxxg2296xxx .  xxxg2296xxx  also plays a pleiotropic cytotoxic role in cardiac cachexia, which is characterised by
muscle waste and extreme weight loss w10, xxxd1037xxx . in this
study, we tested the hypothesis that thalidomide, an
inhibitor of  xxxg2296xxx  production w6,12–14x, could prevent
skeletal muscle apoptosis and atrophy in an animal
model of chf, forming the pathophysiological rationale
for using thalidomide in humans with chf.  xxxg2296xxx 
inhibition may in fact improve ec, not only by acting

on heart function, but also preventing skeletal muscle
waste.
we tested this hypothesis in the monocrotaline (m)
model of heart failure. this model mimics the chf
syndrome in man, in terms both of skeletal muscle
changes and neuro-hormonal activation w7,10,15,16x.
2. methods
2.1. animals
four groups of animals were studied. (a) five controls; (b) 12, 80–100 g sprague dawley rats, injected
with 30 mgykg monocrotaline (m) intraperitoneally, an
alkaloid able to produce pulmonary hypertension, followed by right ventricular (rv) hypertrophy and failure,
without itself producing changes in skeletal muscle
myosin heavy chain (mhc) composition and apoptosis
w7,10,15,16x. they received, from the 3rd week of
treatment, thalidomide w3.5 mgykg per day, dissolved in
 xxxd1896xxx –ethanol (1:1.4) delivered by alzet
(palo alto, ca, usa) osmotic minipumpsx. (c) eight
animals injected with the same dosage of m that
received, from the 3rd week, a saline infusion (chf
group). in addition, since  xxxd1896xxx  is known
to be a free radicals scavenger, we studied five control
animals (d) in which the same amount of dimethyl
sulfoxide–ethanol was administered with minipumps.
after 4 weeks, all the animals were killed. the tibialis
anterior (ta) muscle which, beyond the fact that it is
one of the biggest hind limb muscles, has been well
characterised in our previous works in chf, was excised,
together with the heart. ta was immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at y80 8c until used. rv
massylv mass and rv massyrv volume index were
calculated with a computerised planimeter on transverse
sections of the heart, stained with ematoxylin-eosin w7x.
experiments were approved by the ethical committee
of the interdepartmental biological building of the
university of padova and were carried out according to
the italian laws, which is in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals
published by the us national institutes of health (nih).
2.2. electrophoretic separation of myosin heavy chains
(mhcs)
mhcs wmhc2a (fast oxidative) and mhc2b (fast
glycolytic)x of ta, were separated using the electrophoretic method previously described w8x and their
percent distribution determined by densitometric scan
with a jandel scientific computerised system.
2.3. degree of fiber atrophy
the degree of fiber atrophy was assessed on histologic
slides, by measuring the fibers cross-sectional area with
an image analyser zeiss ibas 2000 w7x.

2.4. assessment of apoptosis
in situ dna nick-end labelling (tunel) (terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labelling) of fragmented dna was
performed as previously described w17x.
2.5. western blot for pro- xxxg341xxx , activated caspases
3 and 9, and bcl-2
western blot was performed as previously described
w17x. anti-pro- xxxg341xxx  (34 kda), anti-bcl-2 (29 kda)
antibodies (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca,
usa), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (17 kda) and anticleaved caspase-9 (37 kda) cell signaling technology
(beverly ma, usa) were used. the absolute values
were calculated on blot bands with the above described
densitometric method and expressed as percent of
controls.
2.6. dna isolation, pcr amplification and analysis
(dna-ladder)
dna was extracted from ta muscle and the apoalert
lm-pcr ladder assay (clontech, palo alto, ca, usa)
was used to amplify the detection of nucleosomal ladder
on 1.8% agarose gel w17x.
2.7. confocal microscopy immunofluorescence
frozen sections were incubated with anti-activatedcaspase-3 antibody, diluted 1:50, incubated with antirabbit cy3-conjugated antibody and then analysed with
a bio-rad (hercules, ca, usa) confocal microscopy
w17x.
2.8.  xxxg99xxx  (angii) assay
angii was measured on serum using an enzymeimmunometric assay kit (spi-bio, massy, france) w17x.
2.9.  xxxg2296xxx  and sph
 xxxg2296xxx  was measured with a solid phase sandwich
elisa (euroclone, uk). sph was measured with the
hplc method described by dalla libera et al. w10x.
2.10. statistical analysis
mean"s.d. are reported. student t-test and anova
were used.

3.5"0.6 in the control group (p-0.04), and 3.0"0.3
in the thalidomide group (ps0.04 vs. controls). the
right ventricular cavity was markedly dilated in all the
chf rats, as reflected by the rvmyv index that was
0.25"0.15 in mchf vs. 1.12"0.7 in c (ps0.019)
and 0.35"0.09 in thalidomide (ps0.04 vs. chf and
ps0.014 vs. control).  xxxd1896xxx  animals
behaved as the control animal treated with saline (lvmy
rvm 3.4"0.4, rvmyv 1.1"0.5).
3.2. degree of muscle atrophy
the cross-sectional area of the ta fibres was
1370"430 mm2 in the chf, 2110"300 in the control
animals (ps0.019) and 1590"240 in the thalidomide
group (ps0.05 vs. controls). in the  xxxd1896xxx 
group, the cross-sectional area was similar to that of
control group.
3.3. mhcs pattern
the electrophoretic pattern of the ta in the chf
animals showed a significant shift toward the fast
glycolitic isoform. mhc2a decreased from 26.0"1.7%
(c) to 18.0"3.0 (ps0.005). mhc2b increased from
74.0"1.7% to 81.0"3.0 (ps0.005). in the thalidomide
group, mhc2a was 27.0"5.0 (ps0.04 vs. chf) and
mhc2b 72.0"3.0 (ps0.04 vs. chf).  xxxd1896xxx  rats showed the same electrophoretic pattern of
control.
3.4. count of in situ dna nick-end labelling (tunel)
positive nuclei (table 2)

26.2"25.2 tunel positive nuclei (p-0.03 vs. control) (fig. 1 c,c’). myocyte tunel positive nuclei
count was 0.4"0.8 in the control group, 12.6"11.9 in
the chf group and 9.0"8.1 in the thalidomide group.
in  xxxd1896xxx  animals, the number of tunel
positive nuclei was 1.1"2.1.
3.5. bcl-2
bcl-2 was 97"12 in the control group, which was
similar to that of the thalidomide animals ( 96"17, ps
n.s.). in the chf rats, bcl-2 was 70"16 (ps0.02 vs.
both the control group and ps0.007 vs. thalidomide).
3.6. pro-caspase-3
pro-caspase-3 was significantly increased in the chf
rats when compared to the control animals (206"80 vs.
100"8, ps0.05). in the thalidomide group, though
lower than that of the chf group, pro-caspase-3 was
still significantly higher than that of the control animals
(140"27, ps0.03).
3.7. activated caspases-3 and 9 (fig. 1a,b)
we confirmed the occurrence of apoptosis in the chf
and thalidomide animals that showed a high number of
tunel positive nuclei, by revealing, with immunoblotting, the presence of activated caspase-9 and 3 (the
mitochondrial regulatory and executioner). they were
negative in the control and  xxxd1896xxx  groups.
we also demonstrated the positivity of activated caspase-3 with confocal microscopy in the thalidomide rats.
3.8. dna ladder (fig. 1d)

the count of the total tunel positive nuclei in the
ta of c was 1.2"2.8 mm3 vs. 39.6"42.7 (ps0.004)
in the chf group. in the thalidomide group, we found

in our model of chf, where the percentage of
apoptotic cells is low, the genomic dna ladder is very

to specifically amplify the nucleosomal ladder. we found
a positive dna ladder in the chf and thalidomide
groups. the ladder was negative in the control and
 xxxd1896xxx  groups (results not shown).

there was a rise in plasma  xxxg2296xxx  in the chf animals
(270"10 vs. 105"9 pgyml, ps0.001). in the thalidomide group it did not differ from chf, but it was
significantly higher than the controls (280"30, ps

sph was significantly increased in the chf rats
(1161"452 vs. 743"148 pmolyml, ps0.04 vs. control) and did not show any changes after thalidomide

plasma angii in mchf and thalidomide was 89"8

was 26"5 (ps0.008 vs. thalidomide and chf) and it
was similar in the  xxxd1896xxx  group (22"4).
4. discussion
this is the first report on the effect of thalidomide,
used as a blocker of  xxxg2296xxx  synthesis, on the skeletal
muscle in chf. although thalidomide and its analogues
have a broad spectrum of properties, ranging from antiinflammatory w13,18x to anti-angiogenetic w18x and antitumoral activities w19x, which may induce several
dichotomous variation in interleukins and interferons
secretion, its major action is to inhibit  xxxg2296xxx  synthesis
w6,12–14x. the rationale for blocking  xxxg2296xxx  with thalidomide, was to prevent the well-known detrimental
cardiovascular effects of  xxxg2296xxx  itself. it has, in fact,
been demonstrated that  xxxg2296xxx  is elevated in chf,
together with other pro-inflammatory cytokines w20,21x
and in patients with cardiac cachexya and muscle waste
w22x.
we have also demonstrated a link between the degree
of muscle atrophy and the magnitude of skeletal muscle
apoptosis w23x, suggesting that apoptosis could be one
of the major causes of skeletal muscle waste. preventing
muscle atrophy could be one of the targets for improving
exercise capacity in patients with chf, since muscle

g. vescovo et al. / the european journal of heart failure 4 (2002) 455–460

trophism is an independent predictor and determinant of
it w8,23–25x. at the same time we have previously
shown that  xxxg2296xxx  plasma levels and skeletal muscle
apoptosis can be lowered, preventing the development
of muscle atrophy, even by intervening on other mechanisms, such as  xxxg99xxx  receptors w17x.
the effects of thalidomide were studied in a well
established model of chf, the monocrotaline-treated rat
w7,15,17x. monocrotaline is able to produce pulmonary
hypertension, followed by rv hypertrophy and failure,
without inducing changes in mhcs composition or
skeletal muscle apoptosis w7,16x. in this study, monocrotaline indeed induced rv hypertrophy and failure, and
skeletal muscle apoptosis, confirmed by different techniques, including tunel, immunoblotting of activated
caspases and the dna ladder.  xxxg2296xxx  was significantly
elevated in mchf rats, confirming that this cytokine is
increased in chf w1,7,10,17x. while in the heart a
cause–effect relationship between  xxxg2296xxx  and apoptosis
is well established w2x, the same is not demonstrated for
skeletal muscle. the result of the cytotoxic effect of
 xxxg2296xxx  on skeletal muscle could be due to its second
messenger, sph that is released by cardiac myocytes
when  xxxg2296xxx  binds to their surfaces w2,10x. in fact, sph
is able to induce skeletal muscle apoptosis both in vivo
and in vitro w10x.
the working hypothesis for blocking  xxxg2296xxx  is therefore to prevent skeletal muscle apoptosis and muscle
atrophy, for further improving ec and symptoms.
recently, enbrel, a specific p75  xxxg2296xxx  receptor fusion
protein, by reducing the biological activity of  xxxg2296xxx  by
50%, was able to improve ec w4x, indicating that  xxxg2296xxx 
is an important therapeutic target in chf. in the present
study, where we used thalidomide to block the synthesis
of  xxxg2296xxx , the plasma levels of this cytokine, as well as
sph, were substantially unchanged. at the same time,
apoptosis was still ongoing, as demonstrated by the
persistence of elevated tunel positivity, the presence
of dna ladder and activated caspases.  xxxd1896xxx -treated controls did not show any difference with
control rats, excluding the possibility that this free
radicals scavenger may have influenced skeletal muscle
mhcs composition, apoptosis and cytokine levels.
in thalidomide rats, there are two aspects that cannot
be explained by our present knowledge: (a) the normalisation of the mhcs patterns; and (b) the slightly
reduced degree of muscle atrophy. as for mhcs, we
know that their composition is influenced by factors
other than apoptosis, which is not selective for fast or
slow fibre type w7,15x and is perhaps influenced by
adaptive mechanisms to the relative hypoxia at muscle
level in chf w7x. the possibility that this may be due
to different haemodynamics cannot be ruled out,
although it seems unlikely, because the circulating levels
of angii were similar in both the thalidomide and chf
groups. we can only speculate that some effects of chf

459

on the skeletal muscle could not be  xxxg2296xxx -mediated.
thalidomide was unable to block  xxxg2296xxx , but it may
have acted through some other mechanisms that were
not explored in the present study, such as the expression
of other cytokines or angiogenetic factors w13,14,18x. it
looks as if simply blocking the reactive inflammatory
response occurring in chf does not entirely lead to a
prevention of skeletal muscle myopathy. some other
mechanisms may play a role in the progression of the
syndrome.
in a previous paper, we have, in fact, shown that ang
ii receptors blockade can prevent apoptosis, muscle
atrophy and mhcs shift w17x, together with a reduction
in  xxxg2296xxx  and sph plasma levels.
thalidomide, in this study, was used at the same
doses employed, and shown to be efficacious for the
treatment of tb, aids and leprosy in humans w6x. there
are no studies, at present, indicating that higher doses
may be effective in experimental models of chf and
we cannot therefore exclude the fact that higher doses
or a longer period of treatment may be required in chf,
although the second hypothesis seems unlikely, since in
this model, 2 weeks treatment with other drugs was able
to produce improvements in skeletal muscle changes
w17x. the results of the present study, with all the
limitations of animal investigations, should be taken into
account pathophysiologically and clinically, now that
the cytokine hypothesis is under investigaton in large
randomised clinical trials, and lively discussed because
of contradictory results with  xxxg2296xxx  blockers such as
enbrel (renaissance), and because some other molecules are going to be tested.
