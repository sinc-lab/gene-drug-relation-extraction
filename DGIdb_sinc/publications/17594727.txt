summary
the ␤2 adrenoreceptor is a large molecule of some 413 amino acids. the duration of stimulation of this
receptor depends on where and for how long a ␤2 adrenergic drug attaches itself to the ␤2 adrenoreceptor. ␤2 adrenergic drugs have been used for over 5,000 years, but only recently have we had the
advantage of adrenergic drugs specific to the ␤2 adrenoreceptor. the short-acting ␤2 adrenergic drugs
most frequently used include albuterol,  xxxd2964xxx , and levalbuterol. levalbuterol, the r enantiomer of
albuterol, has been described by some as a more effective bronchodilator than racemic albuterol,
because it contains none of the s enantiomer. some contend that the s isomer has pro-inflammatory
properties. the 2 long-acting ␤2 adrenergic drugs are salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx . these drugs have a
duration of 12 h and reportedly improve forced expiratory volume in the first second, quality of life, and
symptoms. some recent reports indicate that these drugs are associated with higher mortality, but
several authors have registered the opinion that it is not the bronchodilator that should be questioned,
but instead that the fault lies in the patient recruitment in those studies. regardless, if these long-acting
drugs are effective for a given patient, it would seem inadvisable to withdraw them, given the current
state of evidence.  xxxd216xxx  tartrate, the r enantiomer of  xxxd2155xxx , was approved by the u.s. food
and drug administration in october 2006; it is available as a nebulizer solution, to be administered
every 12 h. several other long-acting r isomers and rr isomers are in the approval pipeline. key words:

introduction
it is difficult to imagine trying to treat patients with
obstructive lung disease or bronchospasm without ␤ adrenergic bronchodilators. these drugs have been in use for
several thousand years and have recently undergone refinement to become the ␤2-specific drugs we now use. in
this paper i review the various ␤2 bronchodilators we use
in everyday practice. long-acting ␤2 adrenergic bronchodilators have been developed to act as controller drugs in
both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(copd). though most patients have a favorable response
to these agents, some patients have a paradoxical response,
for several possible reasons, including polymorphism of
the ␤2 adrenoreceptor, and there is considerable controversy, depending on which literature one reads. the makers of the long-acting ␤2 bronchodilators now place a
“black-box” warning on their products. nevertheless, these
drugs continue to be a mainstay in the treatment of bronchospasm. there are several new long-acting ␤2 bronchodilators in development, the most recent of which is  xxxd216xxx  tartrate, which was approved by the u.s. food and
drug administration (fda) in october 2006.
the ␤2 adrenoreceptor
the ␤2 adrenoreceptor is a large molecule of some 413
amino acids (fig. 1). most of the molecule is in the muscle
cell wall, but it also has a tail outside the cell, and several
loops within the cytoplasm. adrenoreceptors are classified
as ␤1, ␤2, or ␤3, identified in cardiac, airway smooth muscle, and adipose tissue, respectively. ␤2 receptors are found
in increasing density with increasing airway generations to
the alveoli.1 ␤2 agonists (bronchodilators) interact with the
␤ 2 adrenoreceptor and relax airway smooth muscle
(bronchodilation). the precise mechanism of short-acting
␤ adrenergic bronchodilators (sabas) and long-acting ␤
adrenergic bronchodilators will be discussed individually.
history of ␤ adrenergic bronchodilators
the herb ma huang contains ephedra and pseudoephedrine, which had been used in traditional chinese medicine
since 3000 bc for bronchodilation. it was not until the
turn of the 20th century that epinephrine was extracted
from the adrenal gland. this extract was used to treat
asthma patients in 1900, and the first use of epinephrine
as an aerosol was in 1910. a thorough review is found
elsewhere.2 isoproteranol and  xxxd2391xxx  were used until
the 1970s, but had substantial ␤1 (cardiovascular) effects,
namely tachycardia, increased blood pressure, smooth
muscle relaxation, skeletal muscle tremor, and central nervous system stimulation, and those drugs were replaced by
the more specific ␤2 agent metaproteranol. epinephrine,
isoproteranol, and  xxxd2391xxx  are all catecholamines, which
consist of a benzene ring, 2 hydroxyl groups, and an amine

side chain. the only difference among these three is the
structure of the side chain. catecholamines are rapidly
inactivated by  xxxg487xxx , which limits
the effects of catecholamines to 1.5–3 h at most. recently
developed ␤ adrenergic bronchodilators have a much
longer duration of action, which is another reason why
catecholamines are rarely used in aerosol therapy.
another feature of the ␤2 bronchodilators is that they
exist as stereoisomers. stereoisomers are nonsuperimposable mirror-image forms of the same drug, called enantiomers or isomers (fig. 2). the r (levorotary) isomer is the
active drug. the s (dextrorotary) isomer, is the inactive
form, although controversy on this exists, which will be
discussed below. stereoisomers often exist in 50/50 ratios
in solution.3
indications for sabas
sabas are often used for asthma flares, as needed for
rescue bronchodilation, following exposure to an allergen
or irritant, or in preparation for exercise in the presence
of exercise-induced bronchospasm.4 sabas are used in
mild copd as needed, preferably in combination with an
anticholinergic bronchodilator, and in moderate-to-severe
copd (regular use).5 sabas are used for wheezing of
bronchospastic origin, and for relief of acute reversible
airway obstruction.
saba mechanism of action
the ␤2 receptor exists in an active form and an inactive
form, in equilibrium. the receptor is in the activated form
when associated with the ␣ unit of the g protein. the ␤2
agonist attaches to the ␤ receptor at several sites, labeled
iii through vi, in the muscle cell membrane (fig. 3). this
activates stimulatory g protein, bound to the intracellular
side of the cell membrane.  xxxg67xxx  is activated by
g protein, which increases the synthesis of 3⬘-5⬘ cyclic
 xxxd81xxx  from  xxxd83xxx .

 xxxd1773xxx  causes smooth-muscle
relaxation by inactivating myosin light chain kinase, which
is an enzyme that causes smooth-muscle contraction. increased  xxxd1773xxx  also inhibits intracellular calcium release, leading to relaxation of airway
smooth muscle and decreasing the sensitivity of contractile proteins.
a ␤ agonist interacts with the ␤ receptor by binding at
several sites. the albuterol molecule (which is hydrophilic)
accesses the receptor from the extracellular compartment
and has a rapid onset of action. the nitrogen of the ␤
agonist binds to an aspartate residue while 2 serine residues bind with the hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring of
the ␤ agonist; however, its time at the active site is limited,
resulting in a relatively short duration of action (4 – 6 h).
the lipophilic agonists have a longer duration of action
because they burrow into the cell membrane, which will be
discussed in more detail below. the r enantiomer is more
active because of an optimal interaction between the “down”
orientation of the ␤-oh group and the serine residue on
the receptor. for albuterol, the r enantiomer is at least 100
times more potent as a ␤2 agonist than is the s enantiomer.
some agonists, such as  xxxd2098xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx , and  xxxd3017xxx , have 2 asymmetric centers, and there are 4 enan-

822

tiomers: rr, rs, sr, and ss. the difference in activity
between the rr and ss forms of  xxxd2155xxx  is 1,000-fold.1
␤ agonist potency is a function of its affinity to the
receptor and its efficacy. isoproteranol has a very high
affinity to the receptor, whereas albuterol has a relatively
low affinity. salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  (long-acting ␤ adrenergics) have high affinities. a full agonist has a high
efficacy. most of the ␤ agonists have an intermediate efficacy.  xxxd2155xxx  has a high efficacy, whereas most saligenins (such as albuterol) have a moderate efficacy. despite this, their clinical effectiveness as bronchodilators is
not compromised.
examples of short-acting ␤2 agonists
this review does not discuss the older ␤ adrenergics, as
they are rarely used, have considerable cardiovascular adverse effects, and are quite short-acting. rather, it starts
with metaproteranol.
metaproteranol (fig. 4) is a resorcinol. placement of the
hydroxyl at the carbon 5 position creates the resorcinol
nucleus, to resist degradation by the enzyme catechol-omethyltransferase and thus increase the duration of action.
metaproteranol is racemic, and the r and s enantiomers
are in equal proportions in all its preparations. it has an
onset of 1–5 min and a duration of action of 2– 6 h. as of
december 2006, the proprietary metered-dose inhaler
(mdi) preparation,  xxxd2583xxx , is $53 for 200 puffs.
albuterol (see fig. 2) is a saligenin, because there is a
methyl group at position 3 and a hydroxyl at position 4,

respiratory care • july 2007 vol 52 no 7

inhaled beta agonists
which increases its duration of action to 5– 8 h. its onset of
action is 15 min. a generic mdi preparation of albuterol
is approximately $20 for 200 puffs; however, the new
hydrofluoroalkane propellant preparation (pro-air) is approximately $36. all chlorofluorocarbon propellant mdis
will be off the market by january 2008. albuterol is also
racemic, and whether the s isomer is actually inert is
discussed below.
albuterol can also be nebulized continuously,  xxxd2274xxx .5–
15 mg/h, with a larger-volume nebulizer than is used for a
one-time treatment. an increasing number of emergency
departments are administering continuous albuterol to patients with asthma, because it saves time and money compared with administering several small-volume nebulizer
treatments. stein and levitt reported no differences in peak
flow improvement or duration of stay with a 15-mg/h dose
versus a 7.5-mg/h dose of albuterol.6 they reported that
the upper limit of acceptable dose is about 0.4 mg/kg/h,
beyond which there is a significant drop in serum potassium and a significant increase in heart rate.
intravenous administration of ␤2 adrenergics has also
been reported in patients with severe bronchospasm unresponsive to inhaled bronchodilators. roberts et al reported
that intravenous  xxxd150xxx , but not intravenous albuterol, significantly reduced duration of hospital stay in a
group of 40 children with severe asthma.7 sellers and messahel reported on the administration of intravenous salmeterol in 7 patients with severe asthma who were unresponsive to inhaled albuterol. they administered 5-␮g/kg
boluses of albuterol to children and 250-␮g boluses of
albuterol to young adults. signs of improvement included
decreased wheezing, decreased coughing, and decreased
use of accessory muscles, ability to talk, and increased
arterial oxygen saturation. they concluded that immediate
care of acute severe asthma should include the use of
intravenous albuterol to achieve a predictable delivery of
␤2 agonist to bronchial smooth muscle, given that in severe asthma, the airways are narrowed such that aerosolized particles may not reach the small airways.8
the british thoracic society stated that the role of intravenous ␤2 agonists in addition to nebulized treatment
remains unclear. they state that continuous intravenous
infusion should be considered when there is uncertainty
about reliable inhalation or for severe refractory asthma.
they recommend a 15-␮g/kg bolus of intravenous albuterol early in treatment as an adjunct in severe cases.9
the recent global initiative for asthma guidelines include the use of intravenous ␤2 agonists in patients with
poor response (peak expiratory flow ⬍ 30% of predicted,
severe symptoms, hypercapnia and hypoxemia), and to
admit the patient to the intensive care unit.10
 xxxd2964xxx  ( xxxd2964xxx ) has a pyridine ring instead of a benzene ring (fig. 5). the adverse effects of  xxxd2964xxx  are
similar to those of other ␤2 adrenergics. it has a 5-min

onset of action and duration of 5 h. it comes in a breathactuated mdi. the patient retracts the lever on the device,
places the mouthpiece in the mouth, and inhales the medication.  xxxd2964xxx  is $100 for a 400-puff mdi.
bitolterol (tornalate, fig. 6), is a prodrug; it is converted to the active agent colterol by esterase hydrolysis,
which eliminates the 2 toluate ester groups and replaces
them with 2 hydroxyl groups. the onset of action is 3– 4 min,
with a duration of 5– 8 h. bitolterol is not available in the
united states.
tulobuterol (fig. 7) is a drug discussed in the japanese
literature. it has a chloride at position 6 on the benzene
ring. it is delivered dermally, via patch, similar to the
 xxxd2721xxx  used for smoking cessation. it has a peak
serum concentration in 8 –12 h and a 24-h duration. it is
reported to improve morning peak expiratory flow and
quality of life. it may be a useful controller medication.11

levalbuterol (also known as r albuterol or xopenex) is
the single r isomer of racemic albuterol (fig. 8). levalbuterol causes less tremor and heart-rate change with a
0.63-mg dose than does albuterol. rau states that levalbuterol has a higher peak effect on forced expiratory volume
in the first second (fev1) in asthma than does racemic
albuterol,12 but another study, with copd patients, found
no significant difference in fev1 between single-dose and
as-need treatment.13 the onset is 15 min and the duration
of action is 5– 8 h. a 200-puff mdi of hydrofluoroalkanepropelled xopenex is $57. the 1.25 mg/3 ml saline dose
is $85 for 25 doses ($3.40/dose). table 1 summarizes the
names, dosages, durations, delivery methods, and prices of
the ␤2 adrenergic drugs.
evidence for using single-isomer ␤ agonists
for 35 years, racemic albuterol has been used in the
treatment of bronchospasm. however, since 1973 there
have been reports of unexpected bronchospasm and airway hyperresponsiveness, sometimes termed “␤ agonist
paradox.”14 it is theorized that the s isomer, once thought
to be inert, actually increases bronchospasm and is proinflammatory in a susceptible group of patients. this may
be due to polymorphisms of the ␤ receptor. there are 9
polymorphisms of the ␤2 receptor. one is the arginine/
arginine (arg/arg) polymorphism at the 16th amino acid
position of the receptor, which is found in one sixth of
the asthmatic population in the united states and 25% of
african-americans. the presence of the arg/arg polymorphism (and perhaps others) is associated with impaired
bronchodilator response to racemic albuterol and a rapid

824

deterioration of morning peak flow. studies15–17 of levalbuterol (r albuterol) cited by ameredes and calhoun14
concluded that levalbuterol use is safe, efficacious, and
provides equivalent increase in fev1. other studies have
shown modest to moderate improvement in fev1 (5–20%),
as compared with racemic albuterol.18 –22 these effects
have occurred without paradoxical bronchospasm. other
findings about levalbuterol from ameredes and calhoun’s
editorial14 included: (1) a ⬎ 35% increase in fev1, or
120 –300 ml increase in fev1, when using levalbuterol
versus racemic albuterol; (2) two thirds fewer admissions
when using levalbuterol (and, thus, cost savings); and
(3) less frequent dosing (every 6 – 8 h vs every 4 h).
for years it was believed that s albuterol was inert, but
this well-referenced editorial14 revealed several facts that
suggest that s albuterol is not inert and can be antagonistic
to the desired ␤2 response. according to ameredes and
calhoun,14 the s isomer: may influence the activation of
r albuterol, acting as an antagonist or  xxxd1422xxx ; can
promote release of factors that favor inflammation and
smooth-muscle contraction; may increase pro-inflammatory cytokine release; may promote intracellular calcium
and release of agents that favor smooth-muscle contraction; and can counteract the effects of steroids.
even though they presented thorough evidence of the
potential hazards of the s isomer, they concluded that
more comprehensive studies of r and s albuterol are needed
to fully resolve this issue. however, they also concluded
that “the notion that s albuterol is ‘inert’ under all conditions is no longer tenable, and it is highly relevant that the
fda no longer allows synthesis of new therapeutic compounds in a racemic form unless it can be demonstrated
that the distomer has no deleterious effects.”23 on the
other hand, there is evidence against using single-isomer ␤
agonists, presented in a companion editorial.24 barnes noted
that (1) the association between asthma mortality and
greater use of rescue ␤2 agonists appears to reflect greater
severity of asthma and under-use of inhaled corticosteroids, as opposed to the residual effect of s albuterol;
(2) studies that have found increased inflammation in vitro
in the presence of s albuterol have not been replicated
in vivo, and are difficult to interpret; (3) decreased protection against inhaled  xxxd2586xxx  challenge was not
confirmed in carefully controlled studies (protective effects were similar for s albuterol and rs albuterol); (4) bronchodilator effects and adverse effects in response to single
doses of r and rs albuterol were identical, with no effect
of s albuterol25; (5) there was no negative effect of racemic albuterol in  xxxd81xxx  challenge studies26; (6) there was no long-term bronchodilator advantage
of r albuterol alone; (7) there was no difference in duration of hospitalization of asthmatics between r albuterol
and racemic albuterol; (8) there were no differences in

adverse effects between r albuterol and racemic albuterol;
and (9) r albuterol is more expensive.
barnes concluded that:
the activity of normally used racemic albuterol resides in the r-enantiomer, whereas the (s)-enantiomer is inactive. some in vitro studies have demonstrated that the s-enantiomer may increase
contractility of airway smooth muscle or mediator
release, but this has not been confirmed in recent
animal studies in vivo. more important, in patients
with asthma, no consistent differences have been
found with (r)-albuterol compared with (r,s)-albuterol in bronchodilation, bronchoprotection, or
side effects, whereas s albuterol is inactive with no
documented adverse effects.24

in his editorial, barnes did not address administration of
racemic albuterol specifically to patients who may have a
␤ adrenoreceptor polymorphism. that issue remains unresolved in the case of albuterol.
to summarize, it appears that levalbuterol is as good as
(or better than) racemic albuterol for bronchodilation. this
better bronchodilation is more evident in patients with
asthma than in those with copd. it also appears that
levalbuterol is cost-effective, if fewer doses can be administered and if it actually is used to decrease duration of
stay.27 its use as a substitute for racemic albuterol on a
treatment-for-treatment basis is not cost-effective.
long-acting ␤2 agonists
long-acting ␤2 agonists (labas) are designed to have
effect for 12 h or more. presently, salmeterol (serevent),

respiratory care • july 2007 vol 52 no 7

 xxxd2155xxx  (foradil), and  xxxd216xxx  ( xxxd216xxx ) are available. several additional labas are in development.
indications for labas
the indications for a laba are: moderate-to-severe
persistent asthma (twice-a-day for 12-h formulations),28
although this may change with the new guidelines due out
in fall 2007; moderate-to-severe copd (twice-a-day for
12-h formulations);29 maintenance bronchodilation; control of bronchospasm; and control of nocturnal symptoms
in asthma and other obstructive diseases.30
laba mechanism of action
as a result of their structure, salmeterol and other labas
are lipophilic and diffuse into the cell membrane (fig. 9).
the “tail” binds into the ␤ receptor at an exosite. when the
tail is in association with the exosite, the molecule is prevented from dissociating from the receptor. the “head”
binds to and activates the ␤2 receptor at the same place
where albuterol binds. the head continually attaches and
detaches from the receptor site, by the charnière (hinge)
principle; the flexion is about the oxygen atom on the tail.
this repeating attachment process prolongs the drug’s action.
examples of labas
salmeterol (serevent) is a racemic laba (fig. 10). it
has an onset of 20 min and duration of 12 h. it costs
approximately $132 for 60 50-␮g doses, which is a

825

1-month supply. salmeterol comes in powder form, in
an inhaler called a diskus. the patient rotates the diskus to the open position, presses the trigger fully, which
releases the powder into the chamber, then places the
lips on the mouthpiece, inhales fully and rapidly, and
does a breath-hold. when finished, the patient rotates
the inhaler shut. salmeterol is only for long-term control of symptoms, so it is used only twice a day, never
for acute symptoms.
 xxxd2155xxx  (foradil) is also a racemic laba (fig. 11).
it has an onset of 15 min and duration of 12 h. it costs
approximately $117 for 60 12-␮g doses, which is a
1-month supply.  xxxd2155xxx  comes in capsule form that
is used with a single-dose powder inhaler called an
aerolizer. the patient opens the aerolizer and places
the capsule in it, closes the aerolizer, pushes the opposing buttons to puncture the capsule, puts the mouthpiece to the lips, inhales rapidly and fully, and does a
breath-hold. then the patient opens the aerolizer and
disposes of the capsule.
laba controversy
in a 1993 study of patients with asthma, castle et al
reported that 12 of 16,787 patients who were using salmeterol died. this represented an insignificant incidence
of death related to salmeterol. these deaths were attributed
to the severity of the patients’ illness at study entry rather
than to some adverse effect of salmeterol.31 there have

826

been other drugs implicated in higher asthma mortality,
and when these drugs ( xxxd2398xxx  and  xxxd2098xxx ) were
withdrawn, the death rate decreased.32
there was suspicion that part of that mortality was due
to the use of labas, so the salmeterol multi-center asthma
study research trial (smart) was initiated.33 with a
population of 26,355 subjects, the smart study was conducted at 6,163 sites in the united states to compare respiratory-related and asthma-related outcomes in subjects
receiving usual asthma pharmacotherapy alone versus usual
asthma therapy plus salmeterol. the major finding was that
therewereslightlybutstatisticallysignificantlymorerespiratoryrelated and asthma-related deaths or life-threatening
experiences in the salmeterol group, compared with the placebo group. there were also significantly more respiratoryrelated deaths or life-threatening experiences in the africanamerican patients who used salmeterol, which was one of
the reasons the study was stopped at the interim analysis. at
screening, the african-american patients had a lower peak
expiratory flow, had more nocturnal symptoms, reported less
inhaled corticosteroid use, and had a higher percentage of
hospitalizations and emergency department visits than did
whites. it was unknown if in the african-american population there was a genetic predisposition to paradoxical bronchospasm, or a patient behavior, such as delay in seeking care
(poor compliance with study treatments or asthma medications), that would account for the higher death rate. it may be
that the african-americans who participated in the study
were more acutely ill than the white participants, but the
study did not evaluate these differences. for both whites and
african-americans, there was a higher incidence of asthmarelated death and life-threatening experiences among patients who reported no baseline inhaled corticosteroid use
and who used salmeterol. as was mentioned earlier, there is
a higher incidence of ␤2 adrenoreceptor polymorphism
among african-americans. additional studies are needed to
determine if paradoxical bronchospasm due to adrenoreceptor polymorphism was the cause of death in those patients.
a recent meta-analysis of labas and asthma exacerbations reviewed 19 trials that enrolled 33,826 participants.34 the authors concluded that, compared to placebo,
labas increased the risk for hospitalization for an
asthma exacerbation, life-threatening asthma attack, and
asthma-related death. hospitalizations were more frequent
among both adults and children, and with salmeterol and
 xxxd2155xxx .
laba-related deaths might be explained by several phenomena. first is worsened asthma control, caused by desensitization of the adrenoreceptor. desensitization is a
protective mechanism to prevent overstimulation of the
receptor in the context of excessive ␤2 agonist exposure.
desensitization has 3 mechanisms: uncoupling of the receptors from adenylate cyclase; internalization of uncoupled receptors; and phosphorylation of internalized re-

ceptors, which is prominent. phosphorylation results in
uncoupling of stimulatory g protein and blocking of the
connection between g protein and  xxxg67xxx  by another protein, ␤ arrestin. with continued stimulation of the
receptor, an internalization of receptors occurs, which results in a loss of cell surface receptors: the fewer the
number of cell surface receptors, the less effective the
bronchodilator.
another factor in worsening asthma control is downregulation of receptors after several hours of ␤2 agonist
exposure. this is defined as a net loss of cellular receptors. systemic corticosteroids reverse ␤2 adrenoreceptor down-regulation in patients with asthma, but this effect
does not extend to inhaled corticosteroids.1
other factors that may worsen asthma control are increased bronchial hyperreactivity with regular use of ␤
adrenergics, and a reduced response to rescue inhaler.
salpeter et al34 estimated that the risks of severe exacerbation and asthma-related death were 2– 4-fold higher; there
was an absolute increase in asthma-related death of 0.06 –
0.07% over 6 months. this indicates that labas cause
approximately 1 death per 1,000 patient-years of use. since
salmeterol is one of the most widely prescribed medications in the world (3.5 million adults treated in the united
states in 2004), salmeterol may be responsible for 4,000 of
the 5,000 asthma-related deaths in the united states each
year. this is quite a remarkable statement for the refereed
literature! salpeter et al34 acknowledged the limitations of
their review, including the uncertainty of odds ratios and
risk differences when the number of events is small. they

respiratory care • july 2007 vol 52 no 7

also stated that there have been no true placebo-controlled
trials of labas in asthma. as a result of that study and the
smart data, glaxosmithkline placed a black-box warning on  xxxd3162xxx  and advair diskus, which states,
in part: “long-acting ␤2 adrenergic agonists, such as salmeterol, the active ingredient in  xxxd3162xxx , may
increase the risk of asthma-related death. therefore, when
treating patients with asthma, [salmeterol] should only be
used as additional therapy for patients not adequately controlled on other asthma-controller medications (eg, lowto-medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease
severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with 2 maintenance therapies. . . .”35 that fda document35 provides
the drug label and patient medication guides for all the
labas presently in use (salmeterol,  xxxd2155xxx , rr  xxxd2155xxx , and the compound drugs that contain these labas, advair diskus and symbicort). the precaution in the
black-box warning and in that report emphasizes the importance of inhaled corticosteroid use in the treatment of
asthma: steroids actually treat the disease, whereas laba
preparations treat only the symptoms. improvement in
symptoms may give the patient and clinician a false sense
of security, since the patient may feel better. appropriate
steroid use should generally be instituted and shown to be
inadequate in the control of asthma before the addition of
a laba.
labas in asthma
since the above-mentioned studies, several others have
looked at ␤2 receptor polymorphism and the safety of
salmeterol, especially in combination with fluticasone. in
a study of 183 patients with moderate persistent asthma
and who had the arg/arg, glycine/glycine (gly/gly), or arg/
gly genotypes, salmeterol was administered with fluticasone, bleecker et al reported significant improvement in
morning peak flow, with no variation among these genotypes. there was no salmeterol-only group.36 the important point here is that when salmeterol and an inhaled
steroid are given together in this patient cohort, there is
improvement. this therapeutic approach is consistent with
current asthma guidelines, such as those of the national
asthma education and prevention program and the global

827

inhaled beta agonists
initiative for asthma.4,10 in contrast, wechsler et al37 reviewed the morning peak flow of asthma patients in 2
randomized controlled studies by the asthma clinical research network: the salmeterol or corticosteroids trial38
and the salmeterol with and without inhaled corticosteroids trial.39 in the salmeterol or corticosteroids trial,38
patients were randomized to receive placebo, triamcinolone, or salmeterol. in the salmeterol with and without
inhaled corticosteroids trial,39 patients were randomized to
receive salmeterol and triamcinolone and salmeterol, or
salmeterol and placebo. patients from both groups who
were arg/arg homozygous had a lower morning peak flow
than patients who were gly/gly homozygous. even with
concurrent inhaled corticosteroids, these patients had more
severe symptoms. these differences may be due to differences in receptor down-regulation between the various
receptor polymorphisms or to genotype-specific differences
in loss of bronchoprotection, among others.
though the receptor polymorphisms are a concern,
lang, in his review of the evidence of laba safety, noted
a decrease in asthma deaths since the introduction of salmeterol and salmeterol/fluticasone combinations.40 data
he obtained from the centers for disease control and prevention show a decrease in asthma mortality in 2000 –
2002. he quoted numerous studies that demonstrated the
effectiveness of combinations of inhaled corticosteroids
and long-acting ␤ adrenergics. his explanation of the
smart finding of higher mortality with salmeterol was:
(1) acknowledgment of the effect of genetic arg/arg polymorphism on the response to salmeterol (decreased morning peak expiratory flow, more exacerbations); (2) higher
risk among african-americans who are homozygous for
the arg/arg polymorphism, but because this polymorphism
is distributed as suggested, there should have been more
fatalities in whites than in african-americans because of
the make-up of the racial groups in smart; (3) africanamericans were less likely to receive continuous, ongoing
medical care essential for asthma care, they made less use
of inhaled corticosteroids, they had worse lung function at
initiation of the study, and they had a greater likelihood of
receiving asthma care in the emergency department; and
(4) salmeterol monotherapy masks inflammation because
it treats the symptoms but not the underlying inflammation.
lang suggested a format for notifying patients about the
potential for harm from long-acting ␤ adrenergics, which
includes the risks and benefits, the fda’s black-box warning, the differences in opinion about labas, the alternative treatments, and the importance of follow-up.40
the important message is that patients with persistent
asthma should be treated with inhaled corticosteroids first,
along with as-needed use of sabas. labas should be
added only when it is demonstrated that inhaled corticosteroids are not enough to control the asthma symptoms.

828

additional studies are needed to answer the questions raised
by the smart, but meanwhile the benefits of combined
laba and inhaled corticosteroids outweigh the risks. the
smart data should not discourage prescribing labas to
patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma, or from
continuing labas in patients who are doing well.
it is evident that adding a laba to inhaled corticosteroid in moderate-to-severe persistent asthma is safe. in a
cochrane review by ni chronin et al, laba plus inhaled
corticosteroid resulted in: no lower risk of exacerbation
(versus inhaled corticosteroids alone); a significant increase
in fev1 and symptom-free days with the addition of a
laba; and no difference in the use of rescue sabas.41
importantly, there was no significant group difference in
adverse events, treatment withdrawals, or withdrawals due
to poor asthma control. ni chronin et al41 concluded that
there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend
combination therapy, rather than inhaled corticosteroids
alone, as a first-line treatment in steroid-naı̈ve adults. this
reinforces the guidelines from the national asthma education and prevention program and the global initiative
for asthma.4,10
in the most recent review to date, walters and colleagues provide the latest word on this issue in asthmatics.42 this cochrane review included 68 studies, which included 42,333 adults and children, over 4 –52 weeks. the
objective was to compare the effects of regular inhaled
laba versus placebo in chronic asthma. regular laba
treatment resulted in: increased morning and evening peak
expiratory flow; significantly increased fev1; significantly
fewer symptoms, day and night; significantly less use of
rescue medications; and a large reduction in the odds of
experiencing at least one major exacerbation. regarding
asthma-related death, in those who were not using inhaled
corticosteroids at baseline, the number of participants who
suffered asthma-related death was higher in the laba
groups than in the placebo groups. for those who were
taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline, the relative risk
was 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.30 –5.97). for those
who were not taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline,
the relative risk was 18.98 (95% confidence interval 1.1–
326). walters et al commented on the observed mortality
in the smart, in which there was no significant difference in asthma-related death between african-americans
and whites. all the excess in death occurred in the first
3-year phase of recruitment, in particular in 1998, when
recruitment was by community advertisement, rather than
through the subsequent method of recruitment thorough
doctors’ clinics. the excess of deaths was also predominantly in those not on inhaled corticosteroids, and it may
be that excess mortality relates to patients with poorly
controlled asthma, who are not on inhaled corticosteroids.
though genetic polymorphism may play a role in the
mortality, it seems more likely that danger arises if a laba

is prescribed without inhaled corticosteroids in a patient
with poorly controlled asthma, who should definitely be
on inhaled corticosteroids according to standard guideline
definitions. i believe these data reinforce that patients with
persistent asthma must receive inhaled corticosteroids first,
and then should be evaluated and receive laba if necessary, consistent with current guidelines.
labas in copd
labas are a recommended part of care in patients with
moderate-to-very-severe copd, according to the global
initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease.29 since
the heart has ␤2 receptors, ␤ agonists can increase contractility, decrease peripheral vascular resistance, increase
pulse pressure, increase cardiac output, and change serum
potassium and magnesium. however, large surveys have
documented the safety of labas in copd, when administered at therapeutic doses. in patients with cardiovascular
disease, labas should be used cautiously, as they may
exacerbate underlying cardiac disease.43
despite these potential cardiovascular complications,
labas remain a mainstay of therapy for moderate-tovery-severe copd. a recent meta-analysis of 9 randomized clinical trials, with ⬎ 3,500 patients, found that when
salmeterol was used instead of placebo or usual therapy,
patients were less likely to withdraw early, they were less
likely to suffer a moderate/severe exacerbation, had a better health status, and had a greater increase in fev1.44
that analysis reviewed studies that lasted for over a year.
there was no tachyphylaxis or death reported, in contrast
to the previously discussed analysis by salpeter et al.34
stockley et al44 noted that the salpeter’s analysis was influenced by a single study of  xxxd2155xxx , its erratum, and
accompanying unpublished data.
most recently, a cochrane review45 of labas in poorly
reversible copd found (1) a significantly better fev1
increase with salmeterol than with placebo; (2) a significant increase in morning peak expiratory flow; (3) no significant difference in walk distance between salmeterol
and placebo; (4) significant improvement in the total, ac-

respiratory care • july 2007 vol 52 no 7

tivity, and impact domain scores on the st george’s respiratory questionnaire with 100 ␮g of salmeterol daily;
(5) significantly less dyspnea with salmeterol; (6) lower
odds of exacerbation with salmeterol; (7) less use of rescue saba; and (8) no deaths reported.
several reports detail the use of inhaled corticosteroids
in the care of patients with copd.46 – 48 inhaled corticosteroids are added to the regimen in the event of frequent
exacerbations, according to the global initiative for chronic
obstructive lung disease.29 most frequently, 250 ␮g of
fluticasone is added to 50 ␮g of salmeterol, twice daily, in
a combination product. soon a combination of budesonide
and  xxxd2155xxx  will be available.
kiri et al46 reported a 38% risk reduction among patients with severe copd given an inhaled corticosteroid
with a laba, compared to those given an inhaled corticosteroid with a saba. the patients who received both
laba and inhaled corticosteroid had a lower risk of rehospitalization and lower incidence of death within 12
months of discharge. likewise, gudmundsson et al47 reported lower mortality when inhaled corticosteroids were
combined with laba, compared with no laba or inhaled corticosteroids, only laba, or only inhaled corticosteroids. the most recent study to date is the toward a
revolution in copd health study,48 which reported data
from 6,112 patients with severe copd (mean post-bronchodilator fev1 44% of predicted), in 4 groups: salmeterol
50 ␮g plus fluticasone 500 ␮g twice a day; salmeterol 50 ␮g
twice a day; fluticasone 500 ␮g twice a day; and placebo
twice a day. the results were: (1) no difference in risk of
death in the salmeterol and placebo groups; (2) exacerbation rate 25% lower in the salmeterol-plus-fluticasone
group, and significantly lower in the salmeterol-only and
fluticasone-only groups than in the placebo group; (3) significant improvement from baseline in the saint george’s respiratory questionnaire score, with the greatest change in the
salmeterol-plus-fluticasone group; and (4) fev1 increased
the most in the salmeterol-plus-fluticasone group. mortality
in the salmeterol-plus-fluticasone group was lower, but not
statistically significantly lower than in the placebo group;
however, kiri et al speculated that that lack of significant
difference was only because the study was underpowered to
detect that effect.46
i believe it is clear that laba therapy in moderate-tovery-severe copd is justified and that the hazards are
minimal, given the clear outcomes differences of using
laba over placebo or saba alone. clinicians need to
monitor the effects of labas in their patients and be
prepared to use an alternative (such as a long-acting anticholinergic drug) in the event of an adverse effect (eg,
decreasing pulmonary function or increased bronchospasm).

new labas
several new labas are under development. in october
2006, the fda approved  xxxd216xxx  tartrate (rr  xxxd2155xxx , brand name  xxxd216xxx ), an enantiomer of  xxxd2155xxx . it
is expected to be marketed starting by the second quarter
of 2007, as an inhalation solution (15-␮g dose) for longterm, twice-daily (morning and evening) maintenance
treatment of bronchoconstriction in patients with copd,
including chronic bronchitis and emphysema (fig. 12).
 xxxd216xxx  significantly improves fev1 immediately after dosing, and has a duration of ⱕ 24 h. studies published
before the decision to dose every 12 h showed fev1 improvements of ⬎ 15% after 24 h. adverse effects include
increased pulse, blood glucose, and tremor, but at a rate no
more than placebo.  xxxd216xxx  also reduces  xxxg562xxx  production from dust mite and ragweed allergenstimulated small airway epithelial cells.49
carmoterol (fig. 13) firmly binds to the ␤2 receptor. it
is an rr enantiomer with a rapid onset and long duration.
it improves fev1 for ⬎ 30 h in mild asthma and restores
fev1 within 20 min of inhalation. it is being developed in
both mdi and powder preparations.
 xxxd2342xxx  (fig. 14) is being developed in a once-daily
formulation. it has a quick onset, ⬎ 24-h control, and
strong efficacy in both asthma and copd. the goal in

830

several sabas are available, and their adverse effects
are well known. labas anchor in the receptor, which
gives them long duration of action. when used in the
absence of inhaled corticosteroids, labas increase mortality in poorly controlled asthma. however, their advantages (improved airflow and decreased symptoms and exacerbations) outweigh the mortality risk, when used
properly. some believe consideration should be given to
withdrawing labas from the market. though single-isomer sabas and labas are available, their use to the
exclusion of racemates is unproven. several labas are
under development that may offer once-a-day dosing, with
or without tiotropium and inhaled corticosteroids.
