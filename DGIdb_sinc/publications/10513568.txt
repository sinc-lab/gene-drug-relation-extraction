hippocampus of rats were evaluated by using a microdialysis technique without adding cholinesterase inhibitor to the perfusion solution.
we also compared the inhibition of brain ache and the brain concentrations of these drugs. donepezil at 2.5 mgrkg and tacrine at 5
mgrkg showed significant effects for more than 6 h. at these doses, the maximum increases were observed at about 1.5 h after
administration of donepezil, and at about 2 h with tacrine, and were 499% and 422% of the pre-level, respectively. ena-713 produced
significant effects at doses of 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 mgrkg, which lasted for about 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively. the maximum increases
produced by these doses at about 0.5 h after administration were 190, 346 and 458% of the pre-level, respectively. the time courses of
brain ache inhibition with donepezil at 2.5 mgrkg, tacrine  xxxd1891xxx  mgrkg and ena-713 at 2.5 mgrkg were mirror images of the
extracellular acetylcholine-increasing action at the same doses. the time courses of the brain concentrations of drugs after oral
administration of donepezil at 2.5 mgrkg and tacrine  xxxd1891xxx  mgrkg were consistent with those of brain ache inhibition at the same
doses, and there was a linear relation between these parameters. brain concentration of ena-713 at 2.5 mgrkg was below the limit of
quantification at all time points measured. these results suggest that oral administration of donepezil, tacrine and ena-713 increases
acetylcholine concentration in the synaptic cleft of the hippocampus mostly through ache inhibition, and that donepezil has a more
potent activity than tacrine and a longer-lasting effect than ena-713 on the central cholinergic system. q 1999 elsevier science b.v. all

1. introduction
alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative
disease characterized by deficits in memory and cognitive
function. one of the most pronounced changes in the brain
of alzheimer’s disease patients occurs in the cholinergic
systems. cholinesterase inhibitors are the only class of
drugs currently approved for the treatment of alzheimer’s
disease.
we have developed a novel, piperidine-based, acetylcholinesterase žache. inhibitor,  xxxd1928xxx

for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease žsugimoto et al.,
1995.. donepezil was approved by the u.s. food and
drug administration žfda. in 1996, and is now being
prescribed world-wide. a large-scale multicenter, doubleblind clinical study has demonstrated that donepezil is a
well-tolerated drug that improves cognitive performance
and global function in patients with mild to moderate
alzheimer’s disease žrogers and friedhoff, 1998; rogers
et al., 1996, 1998a,b.. pharmacological studies in vitro
have revealed that donepezil is a reversible and non-competitive cholinesterase inhibitor, and is a far more selective
inhibitor of ache, relative to  xxxg248xxx , than is
tacrine or physostigmine. it produces marked and longlasting inhibition of brain ache and increases the brain
content of acetylcholine in vivo. moreover, donepezil significantly ameliorates performance deficits in several

learning and memory tasks including eight-arm radial maze
impairments after scopolamine, and passive avoidance
deficits in nucleus basalis magnocellularis-lesioned rats
žogura et al., 1988; yamanishi et al., 1988; rogers et al.,
1991.. other cholinesterase inhibitors available for the
treatment of alzheimer’s disease are tacrine ž9-amino1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine hydrochloride. and ena-713
žrivastigmine: ž s .-n-ethyl-3-wž1-dimethyl-amino.ethylx-nmethyl-phenylcarbamate hydrogentartrate.. tacrine is the
first drug approved by the u.s. fda for the treatment of
alzheimer’s disease, although it has adverse effects related
to its actions on the peripheral nervous system and to
hepatic toxicity žbeermann, 1993.. ena-713 is a pseudoirreversible, carbamate-based cholinesterase inhibitor
žweinstock et al., 1994; anand and gharabawi, 1996. and
is currently available in some european countries.
since the extracellular acetylcholine concentration measured by the intracerebral microdialysis technique reflects
the acetylcholine concentration in the synaptic cleft, it is a
useful parameter with which to compare the potential
efficacy of various cholinesterase inhibitors in the central
cholinergic system. the effects of donepezil, tacrine and
ena-713 on extracellular acetylcholine concentration have
been studied by microdialysis. however, in those studies,
the drug effects were evaluated after intraperitoneal or
subcutaneous injection žkawashima et al., 1994; giacobini
et al., 1996., or in the presence of a second cholinesterase
inhibitor, in the perfusion solution in order to increase
extracellular acetylcholine to a detectable level žohara et
al., 1997.. in the present study, we compared the effects of
orally administered donepezil, tacrine and ena-713 on the
basal concentration of extracellular acetylcholine in the
hippocampus of rats under the same experimental conditions. moreover, in order to validate the microdialysis data,
we measured the inhibition of brain ache and the brain
concentrations of these drugs.
2. materials and methods
2.1. subjects
male wistar rats žcharles river japan, kanagawa,
japan; 7 weeks of age, 210–290 g. were housed at a room
temperature of 23 " 18c and relative humidity of 55 "
10%, under a 12-h lightrdark cycle žstart at 0700 h. for at
least 1 week before experiments. the animals were given
free access to food and water. all experiments were approved by the animal care and use committee of eisai.
2.2. drugs
 xxxd1928xxx  že2020: ž".-2-wž1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl.methylx-5,6-dimethoxy-indan-1-one monohydrochloride. was supplied by eisai chemicals, žibaraki,
japan., and tacrine ž9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine hydrochloride. by sigma žst. louis, mo, usa.. ena-713

žrivastigmine: ž s .-n-ethyl-3-wž1-dimethyl-amino.ethylx-nmethyl-phenylcarbamate hydrogentartrate. was synthesized
by eisai žibaraki, japan.. all other chemicals were commercial products of reagent grade. donepezil, tacrine, and
ena-713 were dissolved in distilled water and administered by gavage.
2.3. implantation of microdialysis probe
rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital na ž50
mgrkg, i.p.. and placed in a stereotaxic frame žnarishige,
tokyo, japan.. the skull was exposed and a hole was
drilled for implantation of a microdialysis probe. in order
to increase the recovery of acetylcholine, a probe with a
long membrane ž5.0 mm membrane length, 0.5 mm diameter; i-4-05 eicom, kyoto, japan. was used. the probe was
implanted into the right lateral hippocampus at 4.7 mm
lateral and 5.3 mm posterior to the bregma and to a depth
of 8.5 mm from the brain surface according to the atlas of
paxinos and watson ž1986.. the probe was fixed with
dental cement. after surgery, the rats were housed in their
home cage. placement of the probe within the hippocampus was confirmed by visual inspection of the probe track
at the end of the experiment.
2.4. microdialysis
one day after surgery, the microdialysis probe was
perfused with ringer’s solution ž147 mm nacl, 4.7 mm
kcl, 0.6 mm  xxxd2534xxx  , 2.5 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 5.0 mm hepes. at
a flow rate of 1.5 mlrmin. the perfusate was discarded
during the first 1 h of perfusion and then collected at
20-min intervals into microtubes containing 5 ml of 0.1 m
phosphate buffer žph 3.5.. donepezil, tacrine or ena-713
was orally administered after three fractions had been
collected. the perfusate was collected until 6 h after
administration.
2.5. acetylcholine assay
acetylcholine concentration in dialysis samples was
measured by high-performance liquid chromatography
žhplc. with electrochemical detection. as an internal
standard, 500 fmol of isopropylhomocholine was added to
the sampling tubes, and the mixture was subjected to
hplc. the hplc system ždsa-300, eicom. consisted of
a degasser, an hplc pump system, an autosampler, a
column temperature controller, and an electrochemical detector with a platinum electrode ž5 mm f .. a guard
column and an enzyme reactor ž3.0 mm f = 4.0 mm;
ac-enzympak, eicom. were placed before and after the
analytical column ž2.0 mm f = 160 mm; eicompak acgel, eicom., respectively. following its separation from
the analytical column, acetylcholine was converted to  xxxd2298xxx  inside the enzyme reactor. the analytical
and enzyme columns and the electrode were kept at 308c
in a column temperature controller. the mobile phase was

4. discussion
the results in this study clearly demonstrate that
donepezil has a more potent activity than tacrine and a
longer-lasting effect than ena-713 on the central cholinergic system, in terms of the basal concentration of extracellular acetylcholine in the hippocampus and the ache
activity in the brain of rats.
oral administration of donepezil dose-dependently increased the basal concentration of extracellular acetylcholine in the hippocampus of rats. previously, kawashima
et al. ž1994. had examined the effect of intraperitoneal
administration of donepezil ž0.65 and 2 mgrkg. on the
basal concentration of extracellular acetylcholine in the
hippocampus of rats. giacobini et al. ž1996. also examined
the effect of subcutaneous injection of donepezil ž0.5 and 2
mgrkg. on the basal concentration of extracellular acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex of rats. in these studies,
donepezil caused a marked and dose-dependent increase in
extracellular acetylcholine concentration. our data show
that extracellular acetylcholine is increased by donepezil
even when the oral administration route is used.
donepezil at a dose of 2.5 mgrkg was somewhat more
potent than tacrine at a dose of 5 mgrkg. kawashima et al.
ž1994. also examined the effect of tacrine ž1.65 and 5

mgrkg, i.p.. under the same experimental conditions, and
reported that donepezil increased the extracellular acetylcholine concentration more potently than did tacrine. the
result of the present study was in agreement with theirs,
although the routes of drug administration were different
in the two experiments. on the other hand, the effect of
ena-713 on the extracellular acetylcholine concentration
was shorter than that of donepezil or tacrine, but was the
most potent. ohara et al. ž1997. reported that oral administration of ena-713, at a dose of 1 mgrkg, increased the
extracellular acetylcholine concentration by 250% at 20–30
min after administration, and the effect continued for only
about 60 min. however, in their experiment, the effect of
ena-713 was not compared with that of other
cholinesterase inhibitors and the extracellular concentration of acetylcholine measured by them was not a physiological level because of the addition of 10y7 m physostigmine in the perfusion solution. our results showed that
ena-713 is a shorter-acting cholinesterase inhibitor than
is donepezil or tacrine.
the acetylcholine-increasing action in the rat hippocampus produced by donepezil, tacrine and ena-713 was
well-correlated to the ex vivo ache inhibition in the rat
brain at the same dose of each drug. both the acetylcholine-increasing action and the ache inhibition of
donepezil at 2.5 mgrkg were somewhat less potent than
those of tacrine  xxxd1891xxx  mgrkg. moreover, donepezil and
tacrine showed long-lasting effects on both the extracellular acetylcholine concentration and the brain ache activity. on the other hand, the effects of ena-713 on the
extracellular acetylcholine concentration and brain ache
were of short duration. these results are consistent with
the idea that the effect of these compounds on the extracellular acetylcholine concentration is based on the inhibition
of ache in the brain.
the findings on ache inhibition by donepezil and
tacrine are consistent with the observed brain concentrations of the two drugs. there was a linear relation between
ache inhibition and the drug concentration in the brain
after oral administration of these compounds. the maximal
concentration of tacrine ž4.19 nmolrg. was about 12-fold
higher than that of donepezil ž0.355 nmolrg.. considering
that the ic 50 value of donepezil ž5.7 nm. for in vitro
ache inhibition is about 14-fold lower than that of tacrine
ž80.6 nm. žyamanishi et al., 1988; rogers et al., 1991.,
these concentrations of donepezil and tacrine are expected
to show roughly equipotent in vivo effects. moreover, 1r5
and 1r9 of the maximal concentrations of donepezil and
tacrine remained even at 12 h after administration, respectively. these results suggest that orally administered
donepezil and tacrine penetrate into the brain and inhibit
ache activity there, resulting in an increase of extracellular acetylcholine.
in spite of the clear pharmacological effects, the brain
concentration of ena-713 was below the quantification
limit at all time points measured. ena-713 is a car-

 xxxd2571xxx -based cholinesterase inhibitor like physostigmine
or neostigmine žanand and gharabawi, 1996.. this type of
cholinesterase inhibitor associates with and carbamylates
the active site of ache, thereby deactivating the enzyme,
and is itself hydrolyzed. in contrast to the acetylated
ache, which is formed during hydrolysis of acetylcholine,
carbamylated ache is far more stable žtaylor, 1996.. this
may be one of the reasons why ena-713 shows a potent
extracellular acetylcholine-increasing action and brain
ache inhibition even though the brain concentration of
the drug is very low.
the maximal changes in extracellular acetylcholine
concentration and ache activity produced by ena-713
were not well-correlated as compared to those with
donepezil and tacrine. the maximal ache inhibition produced by ena-713 at 0.5 h after administration was more
potent than that by donepezil or tacrine, although the
maximal increase in extracellular acetylcholine concentration after administration of ena-713 was the smallest of
the three. this may be explained by the rapid change of
ache inhibition by ena-713 at the early phase after
administration. in the microdialysis technique, especially
when a very low level of basal acetylcholine is measured,
several minutes are required to collect each sample. thus,
it is conceivable that the rapid changes of extracellular
acetylcholine at the early phase after administration are
leveled in each sample over the 20-min collection period.
this is a technical limitation of the microdialysis method.
we noted slight discrepancies between the inhibition of
brain ache activity and the extracellular acetylcholine-increasing action of the cholinesterase inhibitors used. the
duration of ache inhibition may be slightly longer than
that of the acetylcholine-increasing action. similar inconsistencies of time course between extracellular acetylcholine concentration and ache inhibition have also been
reported by messamore et al. ž1993. and ishii et al. ž1994..
other regulatory mechanisms, in addition to ache, appear
to contribute to the control of acetylcholine concentration
in the synaptic cleft, and may cause the change of acetylcholine concentration in the synaptic cleft to recover faster
than that of ache activity. extracellular acetylcholine
concentration measured by microdialysis is a more reliable
index of the functional activity of the cholinergic system in
the brain than is ache activity for studying the effects of
drugs on central cholinergic transmission.

5. conclusion
the findings of this study demonstrated that centrally
acting cholinesterase inhibitors, donepezil, tacrine and
ena-713, potently increase the extracellular acetylcholine
concentration in the synaptic cleft of the hippocampus of
rats mostly through ache inhibition, and that donepezil
has a more potent activity than tacrine and a longer-lasting

effect than ena-713 on the central cholinergic system.
donepezil may be one of the more useful cholinesterase
inhibitors for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease.
