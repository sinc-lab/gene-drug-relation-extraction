hemcr.-a series of mihquinone analogues 1-28 of  xxxd2980xxx  possessing
various c-4 @dine moieties have been synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity
against human dna topoisomerase 11, their activity in causing cellular protein-linked dna
breakage, and their cytotoxicity against kb cells. compounds 8-12, 15, 19, and 23-28
are better than or comparable to etoposide in their inhibition of the human dna topoisomerase
11, while compounds 8-10 and 22 are comparable to or more potent than etoposide in causing
dna breakage. there is an apparent lack of correlation between cytotoxicity and the ability of
these compounds to cause protein-linked dna breaks or inhibit dna topoisomerase 11. this
suggests that in addition to the mechanism of the topoisomerase i1 involving dna breakages,
other mechanisms of action, such as the radical mechanism or the direct adduct formation of the
orthoquinone with dna or protein, may also involve and account for the apparent kb
cytotoxicity. two different modes of dna topoisomerase i1 inhibition for 8-28 were proposed.

etoposide e11 and  xxxd3309xxx  e21 are epipodophyllotoxinderivatives used clinically
as potent chemotherapeuticagents for a variety of tumors including small cell lung carcinoma, testicular cancer, and malignant lymphoma. the primary mechanism of action
of these drugs is believed to be via their interaction with dna (2). dose-dependent

single- and double-stranded breaks in dna caused by 1or 2 have been widely reported
( 3 4 , and these were suggested to be the initial event for a series of biological changes,
including dna protein cross-links ( 6 )and chromosomal aberrations (7), which led to
cytotoxicity. it was found that the presence of cellular components was essential for
both dna damage and the cytotoxicity (3). dna topoisomerase i1 ( t o p 11) has been
reported to be involved in the process of inducing dna breakage (4,5,8), and 1and its
analogues are believed to inhibit the strand-rejoining activity of this enzyme by
stabilizing the t o p ii-dna complex in a cleavable stage (5,9). however, the detailed
mechanism by which this stimulation of cleavable complex formation leads to dna
breaks and cell death is not known.
on the other hand, a large amount of experimental evidence supports the contention that besides inhibiting dna topoisomerase 11, epipodophyllotoxins may also exert
their cytotoxic effect through the metabolic activation of the dimethoxyphenol ring (e
ring) to produce metabolites that can inactivate the dna by forming chemical adducts. it has been shown that the 3',4'-catechol derivative of 1can be formed under
cytochrome p-450-dependent oxidative o-demethylation of 1(lo), and the catechol
can be further oxidized to the 3',4'-ortbo-quinone derivative in the presence of oxygen
(11). the ortho-quinone derivatives of 1can also be formed in vitro under the influence
of horseradish peroxidase or  xxxd1903xxx  synthetase (12). in contrast to their parent
compound 1 , which binds very weakly to purified dna and does not inactivate biologically active dna, both the ortho-quinone and the catechol derivatives of 1 bound
strongly to purified calf thymus dna and inactivated both single- and double-stranded
biologically active fx174 dna (1 1). during peroxidative activation, 1 had been
shown to form a stable oxygen-centered free radical (13). hydroxyl radicals have also
been observed to be produced by the catechol of 1in the presence of iron and h,o, (14).
in addition to these in vitro investigations, the importance of the oxidation-reduction
processes has also been indicated in several cellular and in vivo studies. dehydrogenase
inhibitors or substrates and some free-radical scavengers were found to be capable of inhibiting l-induced dna damage and cytotoxicity (15). compound 1was also found to
be 30-fold more toxic to normally oxygenated emt6 mouse mammary cells than to
hypoxic cells (16). the in vivo antitumor activity of 1against fs all c fibrosarcoma and
lewis lung carcinoma was increased considerably by oxygenation of the tumor tissue
prior to administration of the drug (16,17). because of the involvement of free radicals
in these processes, a radical-mediated mechanism of action was suggested to account for
the dna damage by 1.however, the importance of the direct reaction between 1radicals and dna was refuted by kalyanaraman et al. ( 18) with the support of electron spin
resonance (esr)evidence. it was found that neither the primary nor the secondary
phenoxy1 radicals of 1 react with molecular oxygen or dna at an appreciable rate. instead of binding occurring through radicals, the observed activity between 1
semiquinone radical and dna was suggested to be through the binding of the 1
quinone to dna, thereby implying increased importance and direct involvement of
the ortbo-quinone in the mechanism of dna adduct formation.
we have previously studied (19-22) the 4b-arylamino analogues related to 1 , such
as the 3',4'-0,0-didemethylepipodophyllotoxins (23) (table 1, series b) and the 4'-0demethylepipodophyllotoxins (19,20) (table 1, series c), as potent inhibitors of
human dna topoisomerase i1 and as antitumor agents. in view of the importance of
the ortho-quinone moiety with respect to its dna breakage and antitumor activities
described above, the synthesis of the 3',4'-didemethoxy-3',4'-dioxopodophyllotoxins
(table 1, series a) was initiated, and its biological results are reported herein.
our initial attempt to finish the synthesis of target compounds was via the nucleophilic substitution on the c-4 position of 3',4'-didemethoxy-3',4'-dioxo-4p-

bromo4deoxypodophyllotoxin with an appropriate arylamine, which has been used
successfully for the preparation of similar compounds in our previous work (19,20).
unfortunately, the preparation of 3',4'-didemethoxy-3',4'-dioxo-4f3-bromo-4deoxypodophyllotoxin failed, since hbr as a strong reductive agent turned the orthoquinone into its catechol. as a variety of 4f3-arylamino-4'-0-demethyl-4deoxypodophyllotoxins and 4f3-arylamino-3' ,4'-0-didemethyl-4deo~ophyilotoxins are in hand (23), we used them as starting material instead. target compounds 822 were synthesized from the corresponding 4'-o-demethylpodophyllotoxinanalogues

table 1 shows the activities of t o p i1 inhibition, protein-linked dna complex
formation, and the cytotoxicity toward the kb-atcc cell line of the 4p-arylamino derivatives 8-28 of 3 r ,4'-didemethoxy-3' ,4'-dioxo-4-deoxypodophyllotoxin(series a).
for t o p i1 inhibitory activity, compounds 8-12, 15, 19, and 23-28 are better than
or comparable to 1.however, only 8-10 and 22 have activity comparable to 1 for protein-linked dna complex formation ability. all others are less active. as for kbatcc cell toxicity, all compounds have larger id,, values compared to 1.comparing

with compounds 5-7,introduction of the 4p-arylamino group gives some increase to
the protein-linked dna complex formation ability in some compounds (e.g., 8 and 9)
but not as large as with the compounds of series b or c. in contrast to the protein-dna
complex formation ability, introducing the 4p-arylamino side chain decreased the
t o p i1 inhibitory activity. there was still a lack of correlation between the ability of
compounds in causing protein-linked dna breaks and cytotoxicity, as observed formerly within compounds of series b and c. this further suggests that in addition to the
mechanism of the t o p i1 involved dna damages, other mechanisms of action, such as
the mechanism of chemical adduct formation, may also involve and account for the apparent kb cytotoxicity. comparing series a, b, and c, it is clear that in most cases, the
ortho-quinone compounds (series a) are less potent than their congeners of series b,
which in turn are less potent than those of series c (a<b<c). however, the activity
order is different in some cases, especially for the cytotoxicity (e.g., 8,10,16,17).in
the case of compounds 16 and 17,the  xxxd2596xxx -quinones are most cytotoxic compared with
their congeners of series b and c .
maanen et ai. ( 11) reported that the ortho-quinone of etoposide can bind covalently to
microsomal proteins upon incubation. sinha and his group (12,13,26) also suggested
the binding of the etoposide ortho-quinone andor the corresponding semiquinone radical with both protein and dna. since the inhibition of topo i1 does not parallel well
with the dna-protein complex formation in the ortho-quinone series (series a, e.g.,
compounds 5-7,11,12,15,and 19 inhibit t o p i1 strongly, but are weak in their
ability to form protein-dna complexes), we propose that the  xxxd2596xxx -quinones of epipodophyllotoxip inhibit the dna topoisomerase i1 by two different modes. one of these
modes is to inhibit the strand-rejoining activity of the enzyme by forming a non-covalent dna-top 11-drug complex, which causes protein-associated dna breakage just
as etoposide does. the other mode is to form a covalent bond with the enzyme, such as
the direct adduct formation with  xxxd2596xxx -quinone, to cause enzyme inactivation. since introducing the 4p-arylamino moiety to the ortho-quinone nucleus decreases the topo i1
inhibitory activity, while in some cases, increasing the ability of the protein-dna
complex formation (e.g., sa, 9a), these two modes may have different structural preferences. the apparent inhibiting activity towards the enzyme is contributed by both
modes. covalent binding of the ortho-quinone compounds with t o p i1 might inactivate the enzyme, and therefore destroy its ability to form the protein-dna complex.
on the other hand, the radical mechanism or the direct adduct-formation of the
ortho-quinones with either dna or other important functional proteins might also be
responsible for the cytotoxicity of these etoposide derivatives. the apparent cytotoxicity may be contributed from both the non-covalent t o p i1 involved mechanism (protein-dna complex formation) and the covalent chemical adduct formation mechanism
described above. the covalent mechanism may contribute more to the apparent
cytotoxicity in the ortho-quinone series (series a) than in the other two (series b and c ) ,
which may need metabolic conversion to the ortho-quinones as suggested by the literature (10, l l , 18). when the importance of the covalent mode exceeds that of the non-covalent one, which might happen with the structure variation, the ortho-quinone compounds might be more cytotoxic than their congeners of series b or c . this may explain
the reversed cytotoxicity order mentioned above in cases of 16 and 17.however, in
most cases, compounds with better protein-dna complex formation ability show better cytotoxicity, suggesting that the non-covalent top-11-involved mechanism of action is more important in most cases.
