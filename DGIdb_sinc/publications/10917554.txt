summary the multidrug resistance proteins mrp1 and  xxxg15xxx  are members of the same subfamily of atp-binding cassette transporters.
besides organic molecules conjugated to negatively charged ligands, these proteins also transport cytotoxic drugs for which no negatively
charged conjugates are known to exist. in polarized mdckii cells, mrp1 routes to the lateral plasma membrane, and  xxxg15xxx  to the apical
plasma membrane. in these cells mrp1 transports  xxxd1816xxx , and  xxxg15xxx  vinblastine; both transporters export  xxxd2213xxx  (gsh)
into the medium. we demonstrate that glutathione transport in mdckii-mrp1 cells is inhibited by the inhibitors of organic anion transporters
 xxxd3256xxx , indomethacin, probenecid and benzbromarone. in mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells, gsh export is stimulated by low concentrations of
 xxxd3256xxx  or indomethacin, whereas export is inhibited down to control levels at high concentrations. we find that unmodified
 xxxd3256xxx  is a substrate for  xxxg15xxx , also at concentrations where gsh export is inhibited. we also show that gsh export in mdckiimrp2 cells increases in the presence of vinblastine, and that the stochiometry between drug and gsh exported is between two and three.
our data indicate that transport of  xxxd3256xxx  and vinblastine is associated with gsh export. however, at high  xxxd3256xxx 
concentrations this compound is transported without gsh. models of mrp action are discussed that could explain these results. © 2000

after selection for resistance to a single cytotoxic drug, tumour
cells may become resistant against a whole range of drugs with
different chemical structures and cellular targets, a phenomenon
called multidrug resistance (mdr) (higgins, 1992). membrane
proteins belonging to the atp-binding cassette (abc) family of
transport proteins play a central role in resistance by actively
decreasing the intracellular drug concentration. in humans, two
members of the abc-transporter family have been identified that
can render tumour cells mdr:  xxxg10xxx  p-glycoprotein (pgp)
(gottesman et al, 1995), and the  xxxg12xxx 
(mrp1) (cole and deeley, 1998).
overexpression of mrp1 is associated with an increased transport rate of a range of substrates that are conjugated to glutathione
(gsh), glucuronide, or sulfate (leier et al, 1994; müller et al,
1994; jedlitschky et al, 1997). transporters with these characteristics are known as glutathione conjugate ( xxxg13xxx ) pumps (ishikawa,
1992), or multispecific organic anion transporters (oude elferink
et al, 1995). besides organic anions mrp1 can also transport
neutral and basic cytotoxic drugs not known to be conjugated to
gsh or other negatively charged compounds (cole et al, 1994;
zaman et al, 1994). nevertheless, mrp1 requires the presence
of intracellular glutathione for the transport of these drugs

(versantvoort et al, 1995; zaman et al, 1995). the data available
are most consistent with a model in which mrp1 co-transports
cytotoxic drugs with gsh (rappa et al, 1997; loe et al, 1998).
another abc-transporter that shows homology to mrp1 is the
canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter ( xxxg15xxx  or
 xxxg15xxx ) (büchler et al, 1996; paulusma et al, 1996; 1997; ito et al,
1997). it is plausible that  xxxg15xxx  could play a role in drug resistance, just as mrp1 does. studies with mutant rats (tr–/gy or
ehbr) that lack the  xxxg15xxx  protein in the hepatocanalicular
membrane and transfection studies with  xxxg15xxx  cdna showed that
the substrate specificity of  xxxg15xxx  is very similar to that of mrp1
(jedlitschky et al, 1997), and suggested that  xxxg15xxx  is able to transport several anticancer drugs (chu et al, 1997; masuda et al, 1997;
cui et al, 1999).
we previously made a set of madin–darby canine kidney
(mdckii)-derived cell lines stably expressing human mrp1,
 xxxg15xxx  or  xxxg10xxx  cdna. in these polarized cell lines mrp1 routes
to the lateral plasma membrane, whereas  xxxg15xxx  and  xxxg10xxx  pgp
localize to the apical plasma membrane. mdckii-mrp1 cells
transport several glutathione s-conjugates to the basal side of a
monolayer, and mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells to the apical side. moreover,
in these transfected cells mrp1 can transport the anthracycline
 xxxd1816xxx  and  xxxg15xxx  the vinca alkaloid vinblastine (bakos et
al, 1998; evers et al, 1998). paulusma et al (1999) recently showed
that mdckii-mrp1 and mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells also export
 xxxd2213xxx  in the absence of drugs, resulting in a lowered
intracellular glutathione concentration in these cells.

export by mdckii-mrp1 and mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells.

points indicated and total glutathione was determined according to
the recycling method of tietze (1969). previous experiments have
shown that less than 2% of total glutathione was in the oxidized
( xxxd2811xxx ) from (paulusma et al, 1999). intracellular gsh was determined by dissolving the cells in 10% perchloric acid. precipitated
proteins were removed by centrifugation, and samples were
neutralized by adding a solution containing mops (0.5 m) and
koh (5 m). glutathione was determined as described above.

materials
[3h]vinblastine (15 ci mmol–1) was obtained from amersham
international (little chalfont, uk).  xxxd72xxx ,  xxxd3256xxx ,
benzbromarone, indomethacin, and probenecid were obtained
from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo, usa). gsh, nadph,
and  xxxg981xxx  were from boehringer (mannheim,
germany).

transport assays
[3h]vinblastine transport assays were carried out essentially as
described (evers et al, 1998), with the modification that hbss
medium was used instead of dmem. cells were seeded on polycarbonate filters (see above). the experiment was started by
adding 2 ml of hbss containing  xxxd72xxx  (0.5 mm),  xxxd3488xxx 
(0.1 µm), and the indicated amount of drug to either the apical or
basal compartment. cells were incubated at 37°c in 5% co2,
and 50 µl aliquots were taken at the time-points indicated.
radioactivity was measured as the fraction of total radioactivity
added at the beginning of the experiment.  xxxd3256xxx  transport was determined as for vinblastine. samples were split into
two halves: one half was used for measuring the glutathione
concentration, the other for measuring  xxxd3256xxx .
 xxxd3256xxx  concentrations were measured by hplc. after a
2–20-fold dilution with water, samples (20 µl) were injected
on a symmetry c18 column (100 × 4.6 mm; 3.5 µm, waters
chromatography (milford, ma, usa) at ambient temperature. the
eluent comprised acetonitrile (55% v/v), water (44.9% v/v), and
trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% v/v). the eluent flow was 1 ml min–1
and uv-absorption at a wavelength of 240 nm was used as the
detection method. the retention time of  xxxd3256xxx  was
2.5 min under these conditions. dilutions of  xxxd3256xxx  in
water were used as calibration standards.

cell lines
polarized madin–darby canine kidney (mdckii) cells stably
expressing human  xxxg15xxx ( xxxg15xxx ), mrp1, or  xxxg10xxx  cdna have
been described before (bakos et al, 1998; evers et al, 1998).
previously, we described several mdckii- xxxg15xxx  clones (evers
et al, 1998). in this study mdckii-cmoat17 cells were used, and
in this paper we will refer to these cells as mdckii- xxxg15xxx . cells
were cultured in dmem with 10% foetal calf serum.
gsh export assays
cells were grown on microporous polycarbonate filters (3 µm
pore size, 24.5 mm diameter, transwell™ 3414; costar corp,
cambridge, ma, usa) as described before (evers et al, 1998).
cells were cultured for 3 days. medium was replaced daily and 2 h
before starting the experiment. gsh-transport experiments were
performed in hanks  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss plus cacl2
(1.3 mm); 1 ml per compartment) in the presence of  xxxd72xxx 
(0.5 mm) at 37°c and 5% co2. samples were taken at the time-

numbers in the table represent amounts of gsh (in nmoles per monolayer) fluxed into the apical or basal medium at t = 2 h, respectively. ‘intracellular’
represents amounts of gsh measured in the cell lysates at t = 2 h. cells growing in a monolayer were incubated in the presence of the inhibitors indicated.
inhibitors were added to both the apical and basal compartment. at t = 2 h samples were taken from both compartments and the gsh concentration was
determined. to determine the total amount of intracellular glutathione at t = 2 h, cells were lysed and the amount of glutathione in the cell lysates was
determined. values are means of one typical experiment performed in duplicate ± the variation between the two measurements.

figure 1 flux of gsh from mdckii-derived clones in the presence of  xxxd3256xxx . at t = 0 the indicated concentrations of  xxxd3256xxx  were applied to
both the apical and basal side (in 1 ml hbss per compartment) and the amount of glutathione appearing in the apical and basal compartment was determined.
samples were taken at t = 30, 60, and 120 min. panels a, b and c: mdckii, mdckii-mrp1 and mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells were analysed, respectively. experiments
were performed in duplicate. variations were within the size of the symbols

in experiments where the effect of cytotoxic drugs or inhibitors
on gsh-transport was determined, compounds were added to both
the apical and basal compartment at t = 0, unless indicated
otherwise. samples (50 µl) were taken at the time-points indicated.

net flux at a particular substrate concentration was calculated by
determining the net difference between the flux from basolateral to
apical (ba), and vice versa (ab), in a transport experiment. the

pump-mediated flux is controlled by the internal free substrate
concentration. the latter is the result of both active and passive
drug fluxes. as we observed a constant flux over time in our
experiments, we concluded that the cellular loading time was
relatively short. the intracellular concentration was therefore
considered to be constant at the time-scale of the measurements.
the reasoning below shows that the net flux equals the pumpmediated flux for the simple case when: i) the pump-mediated flux
follows michaelis–menten kinetics; ii) the substrate concentration
is far below the km; and iii) the contribution of other transport
proteins with very different transport characteristics is negligible.

as:
total flux = flux through the cells + flux between the cells
and:
net flux = flux through the cellsba – flux through the cellsab
the term for flux between the cells cancels out in this subtraction
as ca = cb, in both compartments, where ca = concentration in
apical compartment and cb = concentration in basolateral
compartment.
for the case of  xxxg15xxx -mediated transport into the apical
compartment, considering no backflux from the apical compartment and at quasi steady-state (at constant ci):
net flux = ci,ba ka + ci,ba vmax/km – ci,ab kb

(eq. 1)

in which: ci,ba = intracellular free substrate concentration for flux
from basal to apical transport (mol l–1); ci,ab = intracellular free
substrate concentration for flux from apical to basal transport
(mol l–1); ka = permeation coefficient of apical plasma membrane
(l min–1 well–1); kb = permeation coefficient of basolateral plasma
membrane (l min–1 well–1); vmax = maximum pumping rate (mol
min–1 well–1); km = michaelis constant for pumping (mol l–1).
expressions for ci,ba and ci,ab can be found from the mass balances:
cbkb – ci,bakb = ci,baka + ci,ba vmax/km
and:
caka – ci,ab vmax/km – ci,ab ka = ci,ab kb
substitution of ci,ab and ci,ba into eq. 1 (at ca = cb) leads to:
net flux = ci,ba vmax/km, which equals pump-mediated fluxba.

inhibition of gsh-transport
to assess whether classical inhibitors of organic anion transporters
were able to inhibit the export of gsh in mdckii-mrp1 and
british journal of cancer (2000) 83(3), 375–383

mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells, we measured gsh export in the presence of
various concentrations of  xxxd3256xxx , indomethacin,
probenecid, or benzbromarone. cells were grown in a monolayer
on a porous membrane, enabling the measurement of polarized
transport to both the apical and basolateral side of the cell monolayer. gsh export in the presence of  xxxd3256xxx  is shown in
figure 1; data obtained with the other compounds are summarized
in table 1. at relatively high concentrations a clear inhibition of
the gsh export to the basolateral side of the cell monolayer was
observed with all compounds in the mdckii-mrp1 cells. apical
export in mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells was completely inhibited by
benzbromarone, and partially by probenecid, but not by  xxxd3256xxx  or indomethacin. unexpectedly,  xxxd3256xxx  and
indomethacin strongly stimulated apical gsh export in mdckiimrp2 cells at relatively low concentrations (figure 1c, figure
2a, and table 1). at higher concentrations, export of gsh started
decreasing, but export could not be inhibited to the level observed
in wild-type cells. low concentrations of  xxxd3256xxx  also
weakly stimulated the apical gsh flux by mdckii wild-type
cells (figure 1a). this is probably caused by the presence of
canine  xxxg15xxx  in these cells (see evers et al, 1998). basolateral
gsh export in the mdckii-mrp1 cells was slightly stimulated
by  xxxd3256xxx  and indomethacin. after incubation in the presence of inhibitors the intracellular glutathione levels roughly
correlated in an inverse manner with the amounts of gsh that
were exported (see table 1 and figure 2b). the inhibitory effect of
high concentrations of  xxxd3256xxx  on the export of gsh was
not simply due to a toxic effect as  xxxg10xxx -mediated vinblastine
transport by mdckii- xxxg10xxx  cells was not affected (data not
shown).
 xxxd3256xxx  transport by mdckii derived clones
a possible explanation for the stimulatory effect of  xxxd3256xxx 
on gsh export is that both compounds are co-transported with
positive cooperativity. to test this hypothesis, we studied vectorial
transport of  xxxd3256xxx  in mdckii and mdckii- xxxg15xxx 
cells. various concentrations of  xxxd3256xxx  were added to
either the apical or basolateral side of the cell monolayer, and the

cells growing in double-well plates were incubated in hbss (2 ml per compartment) with the concentrations of [3h]vinblastine indicated in the presence of  xxxd3488xxx  (0.1 µm). [3h]vinblastine was applied either in the
apical or basal compartment, and the percentage of radioactivity appearing in the opposite compartment was determined. the % of vinblastine transported was determined by subtracting the amount of vinblastine
translocated from apical to basal from the translocation from basal to apical. from this value the net vinblastine transport was calculated. the amount of gsh exported was determined in a parallel sample in which
vinblastine was added to the basal compartment. samples were taken at t = 2 h. values represent means of an experiment performed in duplicate.

figure 3 transepithelial flux of  xxxd3256xxx  by mdckii and mdckiimrp2 monolayers. (a) at t = 0  xxxd3256xxx  (0.2 mm) was applied to either
the apical or basal compartment, and the percentage of  xxxd3256xxx 
appearing in the opposite compartment was determined by hplc analysis.
transport is presented as the fraction of  xxxd3256xxx  added at the
beginning of the experiment appearing in the opposite compartment.

accumulation of  xxxd3256xxx  appearing in the opposite
compartment was followed by a quantitative hplc method
(figure 3). the total amount of  xxxd3256xxx  in the transport
wells, as measured in the samples from both compartments, did
not decrease in the course of the experiment, indicating that  xxxd3256xxx  was not metabolized by these cells (data not shown). the
apical flux was higher than the basolateral flux in wild-type cells,
suggesting that the mdckii cells contain an endogenous apical
transport mechanism for  xxxd3256xxx . at all concentrations
british journal of cancer (2000) 83(3), 375–383

tested the amount of  xxxd3256xxx  translocated to the apical
compartment was substantially higher in mdckii- xxxg15xxx  than in
wild-type cells, resulting in a clearly higher net flux of  xxxd3256xxx  in mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells (table 2). between 0.2 mm and
0.8 mm  xxxd3256xxx  net flux increased 3.3-fold, whereas
between 0.8 mm and 3.2 mm this increase was only 1.8-fold,
indicating that at  xxxd3256xxx  concentrations above 0.8 mm,
transport became saturated. we conclude from these experiments
that  xxxg15xxx  causes vectorial transport of  xxxd3256xxx .
to assess the correlation between the amounts of  xxxd3256xxx 
and gsh transported by the mdckii and mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells,
gsh concentrations were measured in the same samples that were
used for the  xxxd3256xxx  determinations. a complication of this
experiment was that the amount of  xxxd3256xxx  required to
inhibit gsh export was higher if  xxxd3256xxx  was added to the
apical than to the basal compartment (table 2, and see wielinga et
al, 1999). for further calculations the amounts of gsh exported to
the apical compartment after adding  xxxd3256xxx  to the basal
compartment were used. after 2 h the ratio between the amount of
 xxxd3256xxx  and gsh transported in the mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells
increased from 3.1 at 0.2 mm  xxxd3256xxx  to 91 at 3.2 mm
(table 2). these data suggest that at low  xxxd3256xxx  concentrations, where transport is most efficient,  xxxd3256xxx  transport is
associated with gsh export, but that at high  xxxd3256xxx 
concentrations this compound is transported without gsh.
we note in passing that the basal gsh excretion of mdckii
parental cells and  xxxg15xxx  transfectants varies somewhat depending
on the time cells were kept in culture (see e.g. table 2). these
variations did not affect the drug-induced gsh stimulation.

we have previously shown that vinblastine is transported to
the apical side of mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells (evers et al, 1998). as
mdckii cells contain a relatively high concentration of  xxxg10xxx 
pgp in the apical membrane (horio et al, 1989), these experiments
were performed in the presence of a low concentration of the pgp
inhibitor  xxxd3488xxx  (0.1 µm). this concentration of  xxxd3488xxx  does
not significantly affect  xxxg15xxx , whereas the endogenous  xxxg10xxx 
pgp activity is efficiently blocked. we investigated whether
vinblastine transport had an effect on the amount of gsh exported
by mdckii- xxxg15xxx  and wild-type cells. figure 4 shows that gsh
export to the apical side of a mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cell monolayer
strongly increased with increasing concentrations of vinblastine.
this was not simply due to a toxic effect brought about by the relatively high concentrations of vinblastine used, as this increase was
not observed in mdckii-mrp1 or wild-type cells (figure 4a and
data not shown). to investigate the ratio between gsh and
vinblastine transported by mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells, monolayers were
incubated in the presence of various concentrations of [3h]vinblastine in either the apical or basal compartment and radioactivity
appearing in the opposite compartment was measured. in a parallel
sample, the concentration of gsh was measured. table 3 shows
that an increase in vinblastine flux was accompanied with a
concomitant increase in gsh export. the ratio vinblastine/gsh
transported was between two and three at the concentrations
tested.
we have shown before that  xxxd1816xxx  is not transported by
mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells (evers et al, 1998), whereas it is transported

figure 4 flux of gsh from mdckii-derived clones in the presence of vinblastine. at t = 0 the indicated concentrations of vinblastine were applied to both the
apical and basal compartment, and the amount of glutathione appearing in both compartments was determined. experiments were performed in the presence of
 xxxd3488xxx  (0.1 µm) and  xxxd72xxx  (0.5 mm). samples were taken at t = 30, 60, and 120 min. (a) mdckii cells, (b) mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells. experiments were
performed in duplicate

at low rate by mdckii-mrp1 cells (bakos et al, 1998). we
measured the gsh flux in the presence of various concentrations
of  xxxd1816xxx  (2–50 µm). no significant effect was observed on
gsh transport under these conditions (data not shown).

in this paper we show that gsh export in mdckii-mrp1 cells is
blocked by the inhibitors of organic anion transporters  xxxd3256xxx , benzbromarone and probenecid, whereas export is partially
inhibited by indomethacin. these results are in agreement with
earlier findings that these compounds are inhibitors of drug transport by mrp1 (feller et al, 1995; evers et al, 1996; holló et al,
1996; heijn et al, 1997). benzbromarone also blocked gsh export
in the mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells, and probenecid gave a partial inhibition. previously, we found that  xxxd3256xxx  and indomethacin
had a stimulatory rather than an inhibitory effect on the transport
of s-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione (dnp-gs) by mdckiimrp2 cells (evers et al, 1998). here we show that low concentrations of  xxxd3256xxx  and indomethacin also stimulate gsh
export in mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells, whereas high concentrations
inhibit. as gsh export by mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells increases in the
presence of vinblastine as well, our results suggest that transport
of these drugs is associated with export of gsh. transport

experiments with a concentration range of  xxxd3256xxx  indicate
that the transport mechanism may be more complex than obligatory co-transport of drug with gsh, as unmodified  xxxd3256xxx 
is also transported by mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells at concentrations
where gsh export is inhibited (table 2). these data strongly
suggest that  xxxd3256xxx  is also transported without gsh.
a critical point in the interpretation of our transport data with
vinblastine is the assumption that this compound is not conjugated
to gsh or other negatively charged groups. the evidence available suggests that such conjugates do not exist for anthracyclines
or vinca alkaloids (tew, 1994). zaman et al (1995) analysed the
medium from mrp1-overexpressing cells incubated in the presence of vincristine or  xxxd1816xxx  and found that all drug recovered was in the unmodified form. the simplest interpretation of
our data is that vinblastine is transported as free drug.
several lines of evidence indicate that gsh is required for the
transport of cytotoxic drugs by mrp1 (versantvoort et al, 1995;
zaman et al, 1995; loe et al, 1996; 1998; rappa et al, 1997).
however, in none of these experiments the stochiometry between
drug and gsh transport was determined. in the mdckii- xxxg15xxx 
cells we observed that the gsh flux was dependent on the vinblastine concentration. the exact stochiometry between the amount
of vinblastine and gsh transported is difficult to calculate.
vinblastine is a relatively hydrophobic compound that diffuses

382 r evers et al

easily over the plasma membrane and the determination of net
flux therefore requires substantial correction factors. nevertheless,
our experiments strongly suggest that both compounds are
co-transported (table 3).
the stimulation of gsh export by  xxxd3256xxx  and vinblastine makes it unlikely that gsh is required to allosterically regulate the transport of drugs by  xxxg15xxx . we propose a working model
in which  xxxg15xxx  has two drug-binding sites: one with a relatively
high affinity for gsh (g-site) and a low affinity for drug, and one
with a relatively high affinity for drug and a low affinity for gsh
(d-site). the presence of a gsh-binding site is not unlikely as
taguchi et al (1997) have shown by vanadate trapping experiments that gsh can bind to mrp1, and bakos et al (2000) have
found gsh-induced atp-ase activity in mrp1- and mrp2containing membrane vesicles. we think that both binding sites are
occupied by gsh in the absence of drugs, resulting in a slow
export of gsh (paulusma et al, 1999). we cannot rule out the
alternative, however, that gsh export in the absence of added
drug is accompanied by a not as yet identified intracellular
metabolite that is binding to the d-site and is co-transported with
gsh. we propose that at low drug concentrations the g-site
remains occupied by gsh and the d-site becomes occupied by
drug, resulting in co-transport of both compounds. we speculate
that the two sites show positive cooperativity as we observe stimulation of gsh transport in the presence of the organic anions
 xxxd3256xxx  and indomethacin. this may also explain why
 xxxd3256xxx  is able to stimulate dnp-gs export in mdckiimrp2 cells (evers et al, 1998). at high drug concentrations some
(negatively charged) drugs appear to be able to occupy both the
g- and d-site. in the case of  xxxd3256xxx  this results in transport
of drug alone by  xxxg15xxx . that  xxxd3256xxx  is directly transported by  xxxg15xxx  and not by another fortuitously activated canine
transporter is further substantiated by the finding that  xxxd3256xxx  inhibits the vinblastine flux by mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells (data
not shown). mrp1 and  xxxg15xxx  do not require free gsh for the transport of compounds that are conjugated to glutathione, glucuronide
or sulfate (jedlitschky et al, 1996; 1997; evers et al, 1998; ito et al,
1998). we suggest that such substrates have a relatively high affinity
for both the g- and d-site and are therefore transported efficiently
without requiring gsh or stimulating gsh export.
for mrp1, heijn et al (1997) found, in uptake experiments with
mrp1-containing vesicles, that dnp-gs uptake was noncompetitively inhibited by  xxxd1816xxx , whereas uptake of  xxxd2811xxx 
was competitively inhibited. these authors proposed a substratebinding site on mrp1 that consists of a pocket in which both
 xxxd1816xxx  and dnp-gs or  xxxd2811xxx  bind in random order to
different, only partly overlapping, sites. in this pocket, binding of
a second compound is influenced by the compound that was bound
first. detailed in vitro experiments with mrp1- and mrp2containing vesicles are required to critically test such models.
whether  xxxg15xxx  plays a role in clinical drug resistance remains
to be seen. however, the availability of efficient inhibitors for this
transporter would be helpful to address this question. the work
presented here indicates that known inhibitors of organic anion
transporters are either poor blockers of  xxxg15xxx  or have the unexpected effect that they stimulate gsh export, something that may
induce secondary reactions in cells. induction of gsh export by
 xxxd3256xxx  is not restricted to mdckii- xxxg15xxx  cells, as we
also observe it in other cell lines stably expressing  xxxg15xxx  (m kool
and pb, manuscript in preparation), indicating that the observations described here are not cell-line-dependent.
