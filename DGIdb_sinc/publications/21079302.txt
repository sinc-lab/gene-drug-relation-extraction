abstract
anti- xxxg2296xxx  (anti-tnf) agents have revolutionized treatment of psoriasis and
many other inflammatory diseases of autoimmune origin. they have considerable advantages
over the existing  xxxd371xxx . anti-tnf agents are designed to target a very specific
component of the immune-mediated inflammatory cascades. thus, they have lower risks of
systemic side-effects. in a brief period of 10 years, a growing number of biological therapies
are entering the clinical arena while many more biologicals remain on the horizon. with time,
the long-term side-effects and efficacies of these individual agents will become clearer and
help to determine which ones are the most suitable for long-term care.  xxxd2224xxx  (a human
monoclonal anti-tnf-alpha antibody) and certolizumab (a pegylated fab fragment of humanized
monoclonal tnf-alpha antibody) are the two latest additions to the anti-tnf regimen. here, we
are providing a brief description about these two drugs and their uses.

introduction
in the past decade, the synthesis of anti-tumor necrosis
factor (anti-tnf) agents has introduced new and
innovative methods of treating many immunologic
diseases. these medications are designed to target
specific components of the immune system and are
a major technological advancement over traditional
immunosuppressive medications. to date, the food
and drug administration (fda) has approved five
tnf-alpha inhibitors for the treatment of a variety of
inflammatory conditions [table 1].
• adalimumab – a human monoclonal anti-tnf-alpha
antibody
•  xxxd462xxx  – a pegylated fab fragment of
humanized monoclonal tnf-alpha antibody
• etanercept – a soluble p75 tnf-alpha receptor fusion
protein
•  xxxd2224xxx  – a human monoclonal anti-tnf-alpha
antibody
• infliximab – a mouse/human chimeric anti-tnf-alpha
monoclonal antibody

 xxxd2224xxx  (a human monoclonal anti-tnf-alpha
antibody) and certolizumab (a pegylated fab fragment
of humanized monoclonal tnf-alpha antibody) are the
two latest additions to the anti-tnf regimen. both
these medicines were approved by the fda in the
early part of 2009 for rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and are
likely to be used for various cutaneous autoimmune
diseases. these two drugs are new to our armory for
various autoimmune diseases. the purposes of this
article are to (1) evaluate the available evidence of
safety, tolerability, efficacy and other pharmaceutical
issues relevant to the clinicians related to  xxxd2224xxx 
and certolizumab, (2) define its therapeutic role in
autoimmune diseases already approved by the fda
and (3) to identify their potential uses as anti-tnf
agents in various cutaneous inflammatory diseases.

reaction is unquestionable. this pro-inflammatory
cytokine is synthesized initially as a transmembrane
precursor protein. the major source of tnf are the
antigen presenting cells such as activated macrophages
and dendritic cells; however, effector t cells also
contribute a substantial amount of tnf-alpha. tnf-alpha
induces apoptotic cell death and inflammation and also
inhibits tumor genesis and viral replication. the levels
of tnf-alpha are elevated both locally and systemically
in chronic inflammatory diseases such as ra,
 xxxg1055xxx , psoriasis and crohn's disease,
suggesting that higher levels of tnf-alpha may directly
contribute to tissue damage.[1-3] tnf-alpha along with its
receptors ( xxxg2300xxx ,  xxxg2301xxx ) regulates critical cellular
and molecular events associated with inflammatory
cascades of autoimmune diseases. tnf-alpha stimulates
the release of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin
(il)-1 beta, il-6, il-8 and granulocyte monocyte colony
stimulating factor (gm-csf). it induces the expression
of endothelial adhesion molecules (icam-1,  xxxg2406xxx ,
 xxxg2048xxx ) and chemokines ( xxxg357xxx , mip-2,  xxxg363xxx 
and mip-1alpha). in addition, at the disease site, tnf-alpha
directly acts on target tissues to induce proliferation or
apoptosis and thus participates in remodeling of the
connective tissue and epithelial tissue. on the other
hand, blocking of tnf-alpha will also counter these critical
processes required for the immunosurveillance of
pathologic microbial agents. thus, it is not surprising
that all anti-tnf-alpha agents have been associated with a
variety of serious and “routine” opportunistic infections
because they suppress the inflammatory response.[1]

pharmacologic properties of  xxxd2224xxx  and
certolizumab
 xxxd2224xxx  is a fully human anti-tnf-alpha monoclonal
antibody created in specific transgenic mice. instead
of humanizing the mouse antibodies by using phage
display technology, recent technologies have allowed
for the humanization of the mice. in transgenic mice,
the genes coding for the mouse antibody genes can
been suppressed and human antibody genes can be
inserted.[4] thus, when the resulting transgenic mouse
is immunized with a target antigen, the mouse produces
antibodies from the human genes inserted into its
genome.  xxxd2224xxx  is made using this technology,
with a specific aim to make genetically engineered
mice that will make human anti-tnf antibody.[4,5]
 xxxd2224xxx  forms high-affinity, stable complexes with
human tnf. the action of  xxxd2224xxx  is very similar
to that of infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab.
it acts by neutralizing both circulating and membranebound forms of human tnf.[5,6]
certolizumab is a pegylated recombinant, humanized
antibody fab’ fragment specific for human tnf-alpha.
certolizumab does not contain an fc region, unlike
infliximab and adalimumab, and does not fix
complement or cause antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity in vitro.[7] the pegylation of the
antibody delays the elimination and thus provides a
longer half-life. as a result of this, the medication may
be administered monthly. certolizumab is the only
tnf inhibitor that uses pegylated technology.

therapeutic efficacy noticed in clinical trials
therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd2224xxx  ( xxxd2224xxx ): in
several multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
controlled trials, the efficacy and safety of  xxxd2224xxx 
have been evaluated.[6,8-13] safety and efficacy studies
have been carried out in ra, psoriatic arthritis (psa),
psoriasis and ankylosing spodylitis. a majority of the
studies have been carried out in ra patients, including
in early-onset untreated patients. in a recent phase
iii, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study, it has also been reported that in ra
 xxxd2224xxx  can be considered as first-line therapy for
early-onset ra.[8]
in ra, efficacy and safety data of  xxxd2224xxx  are
available from a series of studies denoted as ra-1,
ra-2 and ra-3. the ra-1 study is known as goafter and ra-2 is known as go-forward.[7,13]
these studies were performed in 1,542 patients of
≥18 years of age with moderately to severely active
ra.[6,9,10] double-blinded controlled efficacy data
were collected and analyzed through week 24. in
studies ra-1 and ra-2, the patients were allowed to
continue low-dose corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤10
mg of prednisone a day) and/or non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) and patients may have
received oral methotrexate (mtx) during the trials.
study ra-1 evaluated 461 patients who were previously
treated (at least 8–12 weeks prior to administration of
study agent) with one or more doses of a biologic tnfblocker without a serious adverse reaction. study ra-2
evaluated 444 patients who had active ra despite a
stable dose of at least 15 mg/week of mtx and who
had not been previously treated with a biologic tnfblocker. study ra-3 evaluated 637 patients with active
ra who were mtx-naïve and had not previously been
treated with a biologic tnf-blocker.
the primary endpoint in study ra-1 and study ra-2
was the percentage of patients achieving an american
college of rheumatology (acr) 20 response at week
14 and the primary endpoint in study ra-3 was the
percentage of patients achieving an acr 50 response
at week 24.[6,9,10]  xxxd2224xxx  was found to be more
effective than the placebo and mtx in these trials.
the combination therapy of  xxxd2224xxx  and mtx
achieved a higher percentage acr responses at week
14 (studies ra-1 and ra-2) and week 24 (studies ra1, ra-2 and ra-3) versus patients treated with mtx
604

alone.[6] there was no clear evidence of improved
acr response with the higher  xxxd2224xxx  dose group
(100 mg) compared to the lower  xxxd2224xxx  dose
group (50 mg). in the study ra-1, the proportion of
patients achieving acr 20, 50 and 70 responses at
week 14 were 35%, 16% and 10%, respectively, in the
 xxxd2224xxx  50 mg + mtx group (n = 103) compared
with 17%, 6% and 2%, respectively, in the placebo +
mtx group (n = 107).[6,10]
the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2224xxx  have also been
evaluated in a multi-center, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial in psa. this study was
carried out in 405 adult patients with moderate to
severe forms of active psa (≥3 swollen joints and ≥3
tender joints).[6,11] patients in this study had psa with
a median duration of 5.1 years and with a qualifying
psoriatic skin lesion of at least 2 cm in diameter.
previous treatment with a biologic tnf-blocker
was not allowed; however, patients could receive
methotrexate/oral corticosteroid/nsaid. the primary
endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving
acr 20 response at week 14. in this 24-week doubleblind, randomized trial, patients were randomly
assigned to placebo,  xxxd2224xxx  50 mg or  xxxd2224xxx 
100 mg given subcutaneously every 4 weeks. acr 20
responses at week 14 occurred in 9%, 51% and 45%
of the three groups, respectively. at week 14, at least
75% improvement in the psoriasis area and severity
index (pasi) scores occurred in 3%, 40% and 58%,
respectively. there was no clear evidence of improved
acr response with the higher  xxxd2224xxx  dose
group (100 mg) compared to the lower  xxxd2224xxx 
dose group (50 mg). similarly,  xxxd2224xxx  has been
found to be effective in 356 adult patients with active
 xxxg1055xxx .[6,12]
 xxxd462xxx  ( xxxd462xxx ): in ra, efficacy and
safety data of certolizumab are available from a
series of studies denoted as rapid 1, rapid 2 and
fast4ward. certolizumab has been compared to
placebo in 1,821 patients with moderate to severe
forms of active ra in these multi-center, double-blind,
randomized controlled trials. outcomes of efficacy
were determined by percentage of patients achieving
acr 20 response at week 24. fast4ward compared
certolizumab 400 mg every 4 weeks with placebo
in ra patients who failed at least one prior diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug (dmard).[14] patients
were randomized into two treatment groups:  xxxd462xxx 
400 mg (n = 111) every 4 weeks from baseline to week

20 and placebo (n = 109) every 4 weeks from baseline
to week 20. the acr 20 response rate at week 24 was
defined as the primary endpoint of this study. other
outcomes included acr50 and acr70 response rates
at week 24 and adverse effects.  xxxd462xxx  demonstrated
a significant therapeutic response at week 24. the acr
20 response rate was higher in patients who received
certolizumab 400 mg (45.5% vs. 9.3%; p < 0.001).
the secondary endpoints of acr 50 and acr 70 were
superior to placebo (acr 50: certolizumab 22.7% vs.
3.7% [p < 0.001]; acr70: certolizumab 5.5% vs. 0%
[p ≤ 0.05]). the patient-reported outcomes were also
better in the certolizumab arm. physical function
(haq-di minimal clinically important differences)
was defined as a decrease of ≥0.22 points from baseline
in the haq-di. more patients in the certolizumab arm
reported physical function improvement (49% vs.
12%; p < 0.001). rapid 1 compared the combination
of mtx and certolizumab to mtx monotherapy in
tnf-inhibitor naïve patients with active, uncontrolled
ra despite treatment with mtx monotherapy. the
primary efficacy outcomes included acr 20 response
rate at week 24 and total modified sharp score at week
52. more patients in the combination treatment arms
achieved the primary endpoint of acr 20 response
rate at week 24. at week 52, there was a smaller mean
change from baseline in the modified total sharp score
in patients who received the combination treatment
compared to mtx monotherapy, which indicates
less bone erosion and joint-space narrowing. rapid
2 compared the combination of certolizumab and
mtx with mtx monotherapy in patients with active
ra whose symptoms were inadequately controlled
with ≥6 months of treatment with mtx monotherapy.
patients (n = 619) were randomized 2:2:1 to
subcutaneous  xxxd462xxx  (liquid formulation)
400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4 followed by 200 mg or 400
mg plus mtx or placebo plus mtx every 2 weeks for
24 weeks. the results showed that significantly more
patients in the  xxxd462xxx  200 mg and 400 mg
groups achieved an acr 20 response versus placebo
(p [0.001]).  xxxd462xxx  200 mg and 400 mg
also significantly inhibited radiographic progression.
most adverse events were mild or moderate, with a
low incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events.
five patients developed tuberculosis.[15]
the efficacy and safety of  xxxd462xxx  in
the treatment of crohn’s disease was evaluated by
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials
(also known as precise1 and precise2).[16-18] the

 xxxd2224xxx  and certolizumab

results of these studies demonstrated that in moderate
to severe crohn's disease, induction and maintenance
therapy with  xxxd462xxx  was associated with
a modest improvement in response rates as compared
with placebo.
indications
the fda has approved  xxxd2224xxx  for ra, psa
and  xxxg1055xxx .[6] more specifically,
 xxxd2224xxx , in combination with mtx, is indicated
for the treatment of adult patients with moderately
to severely active ra.  xxxd2224xxx , alone or in
combination with mtx, is indicated for the treatment
of adult patients with active psa and  xxxd2224xxx 
is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
active  xxxg1055xxx .
 xxxd462xxx  is approved by the fda for adults
with moderately to severely active ra.[14] certolizumab
pegol is also approved by the fda for adults with
moderate to severe crohn's disease who have not
responded to conventional therapies.
dosage and administration
 xxxd2224xxx  is available in 50 mg single-dose pre-filled
syringes or autoinjectors. the recommended dose is
50 mg subcutaneously once monthly.
certolizumab is supplied as a lyophilized powder that
requires reconstitution with sterile water (1 cc of water
per 200 mg vial) or as a solution of 200 mg/ml (1 ml)
and should be administered subcutaneously. dosage
for certolizumab is as follows:
crohn’s disease: initial dose is 400 mg, repeat dose 2
and 4 weeks after initial dose; maintenance dose is 400
mg every 4 weeks.
rheumatoid arthritis: initial dose is 400 mg, repeat
dose 2 and 4 weeks after initial dose; maintenance
dose could be 200 mg every other week. alternatively,
a maintenance dose of 400 mg every 4 weeks may also
be considered.
adverse effects

infections, lymphoma and certain autoimmune
diseases with the use of these agents. from a public
health standpoint, the development of active
tuberculosis in some patients who receive tnf-alpha
inhibitor therapy is a matter of serious concern.[1]
clinicians should be vigilant for tuberculosis in
patients treated with tnf-alpha inhibitor agents because
tuberculosis in such patients frequently presents as
extrapulmonary or disseminated disease. several
reports have indicated a lower risk of developing
tuberculosis and other granulomatous infections
in patients treated with etanercept compared with
monoclonal antibodies infliximab or adalimumab. in
a recent review, we have covered in detail these issues
along with various preventive measures to reduce the
risks of infections associated with anti-tnf therapy.[1]
 xxxd2224xxx : in clinical trials evaluating the efficacy
and safety of  xxxd2224xxx , the rates of adverse events
were 65% in all  xxxd2224xxx -treated groups and 59%
in all placebo-treated groups.[11] the most common
adverse events in the  xxxd2224xxx -treated group were
upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis,
liver transaminase elevations and injection site
reactions. elevations of  xxxg941xxx  (alt)
and aspartate transaminase (ast) occurred in 24%
and 18% of the patients receiving  xxxd2224xxx  50 mg,
35% and 10% of the patients receiving  xxxd2224xxx  100
mg and 18% and 10% of the placebo-treated patients,
respectively.[11] serious adverse events were reported
for 2% of all  xxxd2224xxx -treated patients versus 6% of
the placebo-treated patients.
 xxxd462xxx : in clinical trials, certolizumab
was well tolerated. serious infections, including
abscesses, pneumonia and pyelonephritis, occurred in
2.8% of the certolizumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of
the placebo-treated subjects. one certolizumab-treated
patient with a negative purified protein derivative
(ppd) skin test at screening developed pulmonary
tuberculosis. four malignancies in precise 1 (in 662
patients) were reported, two with placebo and two
with certolizumab. in precise 2 (668 patients), no
malignancies occurred. antinuclear autoantibodies
(ana) turned positive in 3.7% of the certolizumabexposed patients and 0.93% in the placebo group in
precise 2, but only one patient in the certolizumabexposed group developed a lupus-like syndrome.[19]
screening tests for tuberculosis and other
risk factors before anti-tnf therapy
although tnf-alpha blockers are generally well tolerated,
606

physicians need to be extremely cautious about the
potential of serious side-effects of anti-tnf drugs
and should review the indications/contraindications
of anti-tnf agents in every patient [table 2]. the
existence of any contraindications to the use of
these agents [table 2] needs to be considered before
the commencement of therapy. in patients receiving
tnf-alpha inhibitors, an increased risk of reactivation
of latent tuberculosis infection (ltbi) is now an
established fact. the centers for disease control
and prevention recommend pre-screening of all
patients for ltbi prior to starting a tnf-alpha inhibitor.[20]
screening recommendations for tuberculosis include
a full medical history, physical examination, mantoux
test or tuberculin skin test (tst) or interferon-gamma
release assay (igra)/quantiferon®-tb and a chest
radiograph in those with a positive tst or igra. the
igra or the quantiferon®-tb test can also be used to
distinguish a true mantoux test from a false-positive
test caused by bcg sensitization.[21-23] however, the
rates of indeterminate igra results are higher in
patients with ra.[22]
the conditions mentioned in table 2 should be
scrutinized in each person and specific attention
should be given to evaluate other occult infections
such as hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus.
in the indian subcontinent, reactivation of tuberculosis
or new tuberculosis infection following anti-tnf
agents is a very serious concern. rheumatologists
and dermatologists in india are aware of this issue
and are working on a specific project to have a
protocol that will allow appropriate use of anti-tnf
and other biologics and provide a proper protocol for
tuberculosis screening for anti-tnf therapy (personal
communication). additional studies are needed as
official recommendations vary depending on each

country and their incidence rates of tuberculosis and
vaccination. no official guidelines currently exist for
many other opportunistic infections. however, for
certain geographic areas, screening for histoplasmosis
and coccidioidomycosis has been suggested.[1]
here, we will briefly discuss the current
recommendations about screening test for tb before
initiation of anti-tnf therapy. a ppd of 5–9 mm is
considered positive for those with epidemiologic risk
factors and 10 mm or greater for all others. ppd criteria
for those who are about to begin or have already begun
tnf-alpha therapy is an important issue.[24] with regards
patients receiving tnf-alpha inhibitors, crum et al.
recommend following the american thoracic society
guidelines for patients with immunosuppressive
conditions.[25] they consider a ppd positive with
≥5 mm and recommend consideration of latent
tuberculosis therapy as per the suggestions of gardam
et al.[24,25]
despite clinical evaluation and mantoux test
screening, tuberculosis still appears to be higher
for patients on tnf-alpha inhibitor therapy than for the
general population.[26] it has been proposed that
irrespective of the ppd result, i.e. even if ppd is 0–4
mm, patients receiving tnf-alpha inhibitors and other
immunosuppressive agents, who have a chest x-ray
consistent with old tuberculosis or recent contact
with an active tuberculosis case, should be treated for
latent tb.[24] however, screening for tuberculosis is an
important measure. a very encouraging observation
has been noted in a study of the spanish registry of
patients with rheumatic disease treated with tnf-alpha
inhibitors, biobadaser, wherein a 74% reduction
in the tuberculosis case rates has been observed
following the introduction of screening and treatment
in patients with ra treated with infliximab.[26]
conclusion
 xxxd2224xxx  is produced in genetically engineered
mice that make human anti-tnf antibody. thus,
theoretically,  xxxd2224xxx  has the potential to be less
immunogenic compared to the other humanized
antibodies such as infliximab and adalimumab.
 xxxd2224xxx  ( xxxd2224xxx ) appears to be effective in the
treatment of ra (with mtx), psa and ankylosing
spondylitis.[6,13] however, there are no clinical trials
available comparing the efficacy, tolerability and
adverse reactions of  xxxd2224xxx  vs. other anti-tnf

 xxxd2224xxx  and certolizumab

drugs.[8-12,27,28] the once-monthly injection schedule
of  xxxd2224xxx  provides a more convenient dosing
regimen.
 xxxd462xxx  ( xxxd462xxx ) is effective in the treatment
of moderately to severely active ra.  xxxd462xxx 
( xxxd462xxx ) has produced modest rates of response
and remission in patients with moderate to severe
crohn’s disease, including some previously treated
with infliximab (remicade).[16,18] patients who respond
to the drug appear to benefit from continuing on
maintenance treatment.[17] in crohn’s disease, it
has the advantage over infliximab of subcutaneous
rather than intravenous administration and the
advantage over adalimumab (humira) of maintenance
dosage every 4 weeks rather than every 2 weeks.[17,18]
certolizumab differs from other tnf inhibitors, in
that it lacks the fc portion of the antibody and the
fab’ portion is bound to peg. potential benefits of this
technology include less immunogenicity and longer
half-life. a less immunogenic product may mean that
less neutralizing antibodies will develop and therefore
not require more frequent dosing. how certolizumab
compares in efficacy and safety with other tnf
blockers remains to be established.
anti-tnf preparations have provided a new dimension
in the treatment of severe forms of psoriasis. various
reports suggest that anti-tnf could be very effective
in inflammatory skin diseases like behcet’s disease,
pyoderma gangrenosum, cutaneous chron’s disease
and subcorneal pustular dermatitis.[29,30] it is expected
that like other anti-tnf agents,  xxxd2224xxx  and
cetrolizumab will be used for psoriasis and other
inflammatory cutaneous diseases. the long-term
risk of malignancy or serious infection with all of
these drugs is still unclear. overall, there is no clear
distinguishing difference in the safety and efficacy
profiles among the currently available five anti-tnf
agents. the choice will depend more on cost and
convenience of the patient.
