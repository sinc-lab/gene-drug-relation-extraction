abstract—hypertension and cardiac remodeling are associated with myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular (lv) hypertrophy,
and diastolic heart failure.  xxxd2096xxx  suppresses aldosterone-mediated increases in myocyte matrix metalloproteinase
activity and extracellular signal–regulated kinase phosphorylation. it is unknown whether the peroxisome proliferator–
activated receptor-␣ agonist,  xxxd2096xxx , improves cardiac remodeling in a model of aldosterone-induced hypertension
and lv hypertrophy. twelve-week-old uninephrectomized fvb mice received 1% nacl drinking water. miniosmotic
pumps delivered saline or aldosterone for 4 weeks. mice were either untreated (n⫽14) or treated with  xxxd2096xxx  100
mg/kg per day (n⫽12) for 1 week before and 4 weeks after surgery. aldosterone increased systolic blood pressure in
untreated mice versus saline-untreated mice (134⫾3 versus 91⫾3 mm hg; p⬍0.01). this was unaffected by  xxxd2096xxx 
(131⫾3 mm hg). aldosterone increased lv end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, which were significantly
attenuated by  xxxd2096xxx  (3.8⫾0.1 versus 3.5⫾0.1 mm, and 1.5⫾0.1 versus 1.15⫾0.1 mm, respectively).  xxxd2096xxx 
also decreased aldosterone-induced lv hypertrophy (lv weight/body weight, 4.1⫾0.2 versus 4.6⫾0.1 mg/g) and
improved percent lv fractional shortening (67⫾7% versus 60⫾2%). additionally,  xxxd2096xxx  ameliorated the
increased  xxxg1428xxx /tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-2 ratio and fibrosis seen in aldosteroneuntreated hearts (p⬍0.05 for both). furthermore, in aldosterone-untreated hearts,  xxxd2096xxx  decreased transforming
growth factor-␤, collagen type iii (p⬍0.05 for both), and collagen type i (p⬍0.01) protein expression. conversely
 xxxd2096xxx  increased peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-␣, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-␥
coactivator-1␣ expression, and acetyl  xxxd1739xxx  carboxylase phosphorylation (p⬍0.05 for all) in aldosterone-infused
hearts; uncoupling protein-3 and medium-chain acyl  xxxd1739xxx  dehydrogenase protein expression decreased with
 xxxd2096xxx  (p⬍0.05 and p⬍0.01, respectively, versus aldosterone-infused), suggesting that improved myocardial
remodeling is independent of fatty acid oxidation. thus,  xxxd2096xxx  improved aldosterone-induced lv hypertrophy independently of an effect on blood pressure with decreased fibrosis and altered extracellular matrix.

iastolic heart failure (hf) refers to “hf with preserved
left ventricular (lv) ejection fraction”1–3 and is observed in almost half of the patients who present with clinical
hf.2 hypertension, a significant risk factor for diastolic
dysfunction and hf,4 is frequently associated with cardiac
remodeling and lv hypertrophy (lvh).5 similarly, lvh and
diastolic dysfunction are associated with matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) activation that favors decreased extracellular
matrix degradation and increased interstitial collagen,6 thus
perpetuating fibrosis. tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases
(timps) may predict hf in chronic hypertension.7 likewise,
aldosterone antagonists (used in chronic hf and in hypertension) exert positive effects by downregulating mmp activity.8 –11 despite the increasing incidence of diastolic hf and

elevated mortality rates,12 there remains a paucity of therapies
that target these potential underlying mechanism(s).
 xxxd2096xxx , a peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-␣
(ppar-␣) agonist, is used clinically for the treatment of dyslipidemias. intriguingly, fibrates are being considered as possible therapeutic agents for the treatment of cardiac remodeling.13 the myocardial effects of  xxxd2096xxx  are independent
of its lipid-lowering actions and are partly due to ppar-␣–
mediated suppression of inflammatory transcription factors
(eg, nuclear factor-␬b and activating protein-1)14 –16 and
inhibition of macrophage recruitment.17 inhibition of nuclear
factor-␬b with fenofibrates in hypertension prevents the
development of diastolic dysfunction.18 we previously demonstrated in isolated adult cardiomyocytes that  xxxd2096xxx

inhibits mmp activity and aldosterone-stimulated increases
in extracellular signal–regulated kinase phosphorylation.19
in the present study, we used a murine model of aldosterone-induced hypertension and diastolic hf to test the hypothesis that  xxxd2096xxx  exerts beneficial effects on myocardial structure, function, and matrix.

materials and methods
animals
study protocols were reviewed and approved by the institutional
animal care and use committee of the boston university school of
medicine. in brief, 12-week-old fvb mice (charles river, wilmington, mass) were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle in a
temperature-controlled (19°c to 21°c) room and were fed standard
rodent chow ad libitum.

vinylidene difluoride membranes (amersham pharmacia biotech).
membranes were probed with antibodies specific to  xxxg1440xxx ,
 xxxg1428xxx , timp-1, timp-2 (chemicon), medium-chain acylcoenzyme a dehydrogenase (mcad), uncoupling protein-3 (ucp3,
cayman), transforming growth factor (tgf)-␤ (r&d systems),
collagens i and iii (rockland), pan–amp-activated protein kinase-␣
(ampk, cell signaling), phosphoacetyl  xxxd1739xxx  carboxylase
(ser-79, upstate), ppar-␥ coactivator-1␣ (pgc-1␣, chemicon), or
actin (sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature or, specific to
phospho-ampk (thr-172, cell signaling) or ppar-␣ (santa cruz
biotechnology), overnight at 4°c. bound antibodies were detected
with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase–linked whole secondary
antibodies. all blots were normalized against coomassie brilliant
blue staining of the gels (sigma-aldrich). protein immunoblots were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence, and bands were quantified by scanning densitometry (bio-rad).

statistical analysis
aldosterone infusion
uninephrectomized mice (27 to 30 g) received an osmotic minipump
(alzet, durect corp) that delivered a continuous infusion of either
saline or  xxxd103xxx  (0.15 ␮g/h; sigma-aldrich) for 4 weeks.20,21
additionally, all mice were maintained on 1% nacl drinking water.

treatment
thirty mice were randomly assigned to either regular chow or chow
containing  xxxd2096xxx  (100 mg/kg body weight [bw] per day) for 1
week before and 4 weeks after surgery. the dose of  xxxd2096xxx  has
been used by others22,23 and has been shown to be nontoxic. the 4
groups examined were as follows: saline-untreated, salinefenofibrate, aldosterone-untreated, and aldosterone- xxxd2096xxx .

physiologic measurements
after 4 weeks of saline or aldosterone infusion, heart rate and
systolic blood pressure (bp) were measured with a noninvasive
tail-cuff system (bp-2000, visitech) as previously described.10,24
transthoracic echocardiography was performed in conscious mice 4
weeks after surgery. echocardiography was performed as previously
described10 with an acuson sequoia c-256 echocardiograph machine and a 15-mhz probe.

organ weights and tissue analysis
after 4 weeks, mice were euthanized, bw was measured, and the
hearts were either (1) arrested in diastole by kcl (30 mmol/l),
weighed, perfused with 10% buffered formalin, and sliced horizontally for histology or (2) snap-frozen in ln2. to measure fibrosis,
trichrome-stained sections (5 ␮m) were visualized by light microscopy, and the entire section was quantified with the use of bioquant
image analysis software. additionally, frozen lv transverse sections
were examined for intramyocardial lipid accumulation by staining
with oil red o. the wet-to-dry weights of the lungs were determined,
and the ratio was taken as an index of pulmonary congestion and
clinical hf.25

immunoblot analysis
aliquots of tissue protein (30 ␮g) were separated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to poly-

results are presented as mean⫾sem. differences between mice
with and without  xxxd2096xxx  treatment were tested with student t
tests or 2-way anovas followed by student-newman-keuls post
hoc tests, which were used for establishing significant differences
among groups. a value of p⬍0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

results
aldosterone- and  xxxd2096xxx -mediated effects on
cardiac physiology and morphology
four weeks of aldosterone infusion in uninephrectomized
mice significantly increased systolic bp in both untreated
(134⫾3 mm hg) and  xxxd2096xxx -treated (131⫾3 mm hg)
mice versus saline-infused controls (p⬍0.01 for both; the
table).  xxxd2096xxx  had no effect on bp in either salineuntreated or aldosterone-infused groups. heart rate was not
affected by aldosterone infusion alone; however,  xxxd2096xxx 
modestly increased heat rate in aldosterone-infused mice.
additionally, during the 4 weeks after surgery, there were no
deaths in either sham or aldosterone groups.
an increase in bw was observed in aldosterone-infused
mice, but this was unaffected by  xxxd2096xxx  treatment
(p⫽ns). as expected, aldosterone caused cardiac hypertrophy, as reflected by an increased lv weight–to-bw (lv/
bw) ratio (21% increase, p⬍0.01 versus saline-untreated).
as shown in the table,  xxxd2096xxx  significantly reduced
aldosterone-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and the lv/bw
ratio (4.6⫾0.1 versus 4.1⫾0.2 mg/g). aldosterone infusion
also caused significant pulmonary venous congestion, as
indicated by the increased wet-to-dry lung weight ratio. this
wet-to-dry ratio, an indicator of pulmonary congestion and
clinical hf,25 was unaffected by  xxxd2096xxx  treatment. thus,
 xxxd2096xxx  ameliorated aldosterone-induced lvh but had no
effect on systolic bp or pulmonary venous congestion.

aldosterone- and  xxxd2096xxx -mediated effects on
cardiac structure and systolic function
modest increases in both lv end-diastolic diameter (⫹36%,
p⬍0.01) and lv end-systolic diameter (⫹27%, p⬍0.01)
were elicited by aldosterone versus saline-untreated (figures
1a and 1b). the increase in lv end-systolic diameter with
aldosterone infusion was completely abrogated by  xxxd2096xxx 
treatment, and the increase in lv end-diastolic diameter was
partially suppressed (p⬍0.05 versus aldosterone-untreated;
figures 1a and 1b). collectively, these effects of  xxxd2096xxx 
on aldosterone-induced changes in lv systolic function
resulted in a relative (but not significant) increase in percent
fractional shortening (figure 1c). thus, aldosteronemediated hf occurred in the absence of a decrease in
fractional shortening, consistent with a model of diastolic hf
(pulmonary venous congestion and “normal” lv fractional
shortening). similar to the lv/bw ratio (the table), the
interventricular septal wall thickness was attenuated with
 xxxd2096xxx  in the aldosterone-infused mice (p⬍0.05 versus
aldosterone-untreated; figure 1d). thus,  xxxd2096xxx  ameliorated aldosterone-induced lv dilation and hypertrophy but
had no effect lv systolic function.

aldosterone- and  xxxd2096xxx -mediated effects on
myocardial fibrosis
lv cross sections from aldosterone-untreated mice had
marked positive trichrome staining, indicative of fibrosis
(figure 2a). in aldosterone- xxxd2096xxx  mice, this was significantly less evident, consistent with decreased fibrosis
(41⫾3%, p⬍0.05 versus aldosterone-untreated; figure 2b).
to examine potential mechanisms whereby  xxxd2096xxx 
may exert beneficial effects on matrix turnover and fibrosis,
we examined mmp and timp protein expression (figure 3).
in the presence and absence of  xxxd2096xxx , aldosterone
significantly increased  xxxg1428xxx  protein expression relative to
saline-untreated mice (p⬍0.01 and p⬍0.05, respectively).
the magnitude of aldosterone-induced  xxxg1428xxx  expression

(figure 3a) was decreased 25⫾1% in aldosterone- xxxd2096xxx 
versus aldosterone-untreated mice (p⬍0.05). timp-2 expression was increased ⬇6-fold with aldosterone (p⬍0.01 versus
saline-untreated) or an additional 30⫾7% with  xxxd2096xxx 
(p⬍0.05 versus aldosterone-untreated; figure 3b). the resulting  xxxg1428xxx /timp-2 ratio, an index of net mmp activation, was significantly decreased in aldosterone- xxxd2096xxx 
hearts (p⬍0.05 versus aldosterone-untreated; figure 3c).
myocardial  xxxg1440xxx  and timp-1 expression was increased in
aldosterone-untreated hearts (p⬍0.01 and p⬍0.05, respectively, versus saline-untreated) but remained unaffected by
 xxxd2096xxx  treatment (figures 4a and 4b). thus,  xxxd2096xxx 
in aldosterone-untreated mice had no effect on the  xxxg1440xxx /
timp-1 ratio (figure 4c).
because tgf-␤ is an important regulator of mmp expression and overexpression of tgf-␤ elevates type iii collagen
expression in some cell types, we sought to determine
whether regulators of the extracellular matrix were altered by
 xxxd2096xxx  (figures 5a through 5c).  xxxd2096xxx  decreased
myocardial protein expression of tgf-␤ by 3.4-fold
(p⬍0.05), type i collagen i by 3-fold (p⬍0.01), and type iii
collagen by 1.5-fold (p⬍0.05) versus aldosterone-untreated
hearts). thus,  xxxd2096xxx  inhibited aldosterone-induced fibrosis and regulators of the extracellular matrix in vivo.

aldosterone- and  xxxd2096xxx -mediated effects on
myocardial lipid deposition
for lv myocardial tissue, longitudinal and cross sections
were stained with oil red o to determine whether aldosterone-mediated cardiac remodeling was associated with lipid
accumulation. myocardial tissue sections from aldosteroneuntreated mice demonstrated positive punctuate staining. as
illustrated in figure 6a, this staining was notably absent in
sections from  xxxd2096xxx -treated mice and comparable with
those of saline-untreated mice.
we also sought to determine whether differences in lv
lipid accumulation occurred in parallel with, or affected

mediators of, fatty acid oxidation and classic ppar-␣ targets
with  xxxd2096xxx . we thus examined the protein expression of
ucp3, mcad, (figures 6b and 6c), ppar-␣, pgc-1␣, and
the phosphorylation of acetyl  xxxd1739xxx  carboxylase and
ampk (figures 6d and 6e).  xxxd2096xxx  significantly increased the expression of ppar-␣ and pgc-1␣, mediators of
mitochondrial biogenesis, and the phosphorylation of acetyl
 xxxd1739xxx  carboxylase, but not of ampk. however, ucp3
expression tended to decrease versus saline-untreated mice,
and  xxxd2096xxx  further decreased ucp3 protein expression
(p⬍0.05 versus aldosterone-untreated). similarly, mcad
expression, another enzyme in the fatty acid ␤-oxidation
pathway, was measured and was similarly reduced in aldosterone- xxxd2096xxx  mice (p⬍0.01 versus aldosteroneuntreated; figure 6c). thus,  xxxd2096xxx  decreased protein
expression of enzymes in the oxidation pathway of longchain  xxxd2154xxx  in aldosterone-mediated cardiac remodeling.

discussion
in this study, after 4 weeks of aldosterone infusion, there was
a significant increase in systolic bp, pronounced cardiac
hypertrophy, and preserved lv systolic function. additionally, concomitant treatment with  xxxd2096xxx  had no effect on
bp yet ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy. aldosterone administration was also associated with marked fibrosis and some
lipid deposition in the myocardium. these deleterious effects
were markedly attenuated by  xxxd2096xxx  treatment. reduced

fibrosis was associated with  xxxd2096xxx -mediated changes in
the expression of mmps and timps, and decreased lipid
accumulation occurred in conjunction with the reduction in
cardiac hypertrophy. the decreased lipid accumulation was
associated with decreased expression of the ppar-␣ targets,
ucp3 and mcad.
diastolic hf is distinguished from systolic hf by a
preserved lv ejection fraction. thus, in response to aldosterone infusion, we observed marked cardiac hypertrophy,
pulmonary venous congestion, and hypertension in the presence of preserved fractional shortening. although we did not
measure lv end-diastolic pressure, it is likely that the
increased pulmonary congestion reflects increased lv enddiastolic pressure,1–3 a hallmark of diastolic dysfunction. in
our study, there was no therapeutic effect of  xxxd2096xxx  on
the wet-dry weight ratio; however, ogata et al26 used this
agent for 5 weeks and demonstrated improved diastolic
function as measured by lv end-diastolic pressure,26 possibly
by improving the vasculature and active relaxation of the
myocardium.1,27 whether improved diastolic function in response to  xxxd2096xxx  occurred in our model and whether this
effect may ameliorate venous congestion remain to be determined. hypertension is a significant risk factor for diastolic
dysfunction. consistent with prior reports,18,28 we did not
observe an effect of  xxxd2096xxx  on bp. however, other
ppar-␣ agonists (ie, docosahexaenoic acid and  xxxd1724xxx )
have decreased bp in other models of hypertension, possibly

by inhibiting nadph oxidase–induced oxidative stress and
inflammation in the vascular wall 29 and reducing
endothelin-b receptor blockade in the kidney.30
we previously showed that aldosterone increases myocyte
mmp activity and extracellular signal–regulated kinase phosphorylation11 and may be inhibited by  xxxd2096xxx .19 similar
to other in vivo models of hf (ie, mice subjected to pressure
overload or  xxxg99xxx  infusions), aldosterone administration induces a proinflammatory and a profibrotic phenotype.10,31 in our study, aldosterone-induced lvh was associated with an increased  xxxg1428xxx /timp-2 ratio. the increased
mmp activity may contribute to ventricular remodeling and
lvh by impairing the integrity of the interstitial matrix.32,33
similar to the findings of other studies,21,34,35 aldosteronemediated increases in the  xxxg1428xxx /timp-2 ratio was associated with significant interstitial fibrosis, which was attenuated
by  xxxd2096xxx .  xxxd2096xxx  may exert ppar-␣–independent
effects by increasing  xxxg1428xxx  and decreasing timp-2 expression,19 resulting in lvh and fibrosis. similarly, the  xxxg1428xxx 
gene plays a critical role in myocyte hypertrophy,36 pressure
overload–induced lvh,10,31 and in the promotion of interstitial fibrosis.36 thus, its inhibition may contribute to the
decrease in lvh.19
tgf-␤ suppresses proteolytic activity by increasing timp,
 xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  expression.37 similarly, tgf-␤ is implicated in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy38 and inhibits mmp
expression by sequestering unbound activating protein-1.39
tgf-␤ increases type i and type iii collagen synthesis40 and
with aldosterone infusion,  xxxd2096xxx  likely inhibits  xxxg1428xxx 

by inhibiting tgf-␤.28,41,42 therefore,  xxxd2096xxx  mediates
inhibitory effects on tgf-␤ and types i and iii collagen and
therefore inhibits  xxxg1428xxx . this promotes normalization of
collagen turnover10,18 and contributes, in part, to the improved
lv structure and maintenance of normal lv function seen
with  xxxd2096xxx . these findings complement previous reports
that  xxxd2096xxx  inhibits myocardial fibrosis and inflammation
by inhibiting p38,26,43 nuclear factor-␬b signaling pathways,44 suppressing prohypertrophic and redox-regulated
transcription factors,28,31 cardiac  xxxg674xxx  production,26,45,46 and inhibiting  xxxg1440xxx .16 additionally, both
ppar-␣ and ppar-␥ agonists inhibit tgf-␤ signaling by
interacting with smad transcription factors47– 49 and although
speculative, may constitute a mechanism for ppar-␣–mediated inhibition of tgf-␤–regulated gene expression in aldosterone-induced fibrosis.
ppar-␣ is regulated during development, disease, and
cardiac metabolism. during acute pressure-overload hf,50
ppar-␣ is diminished, fatty acid oxidation is reduced, and
lipids accumulate in myocytes.50 interestingly,  xxxd2096xxx  in
pressure overload has been observed to both worsen23,51 and
improve19 heart function, depending on the duration of hf. in
our study,  xxxd2096xxx  eliminated aldosterone-infused myocardial lipid accumulation. the relation between lipid accumulation and fibrosis is unclear, but an interplay between
tissue repair (ie, tgf-␤ signaling) and energy metabolism as
an adaptive response to injury or stress may exist.48 similarly,
overexpressing acyl  xxxd1739xxx  synthase increases myocyte
triacylglycerol content and results in myofiber disorganiza-

tion, interstitial fibrosis, and lv dysfunction.52 others have
suggested a causal link between lipid accumulation and
cardiac dysfunction,53,54 with myocardial lipid accumulation
resulting from either an overexpression or underexpression of
fatty acid enzymes.53 interestingly, we observed decreased
myocardial lipid deposition with  xxxd2096xxx  and increased
myocardial ppar-␣, pgc-1␣, and phosphoacetyl coenzyme
a carboxylase protein expression. however, ucp3 and
mcad protein expression, key mediators of fatty acid
oxidation, were decreased. our study was not designed to
establish a cause or effect, nor did we measure metabolically
regulated gene expression or fatty acid oxidation rates.
dissociation between metabolic genes and protein expression
has been shown to exist.55 another reason for our findings
may be that, similar to antioxidant enzymes in hf,56 decreased ucp3 and mcad protein expression reflects decreased translation or posttranslational modification of metabolic enzymes.57,58 additionally, our findings may differ
because of the model of hf (diastolic versus systolic),
method of inducing hf (aldosterone infusion versus pacing

induced59), and animal species (mice versus dogs). lastly, the
light/dark cycle (circadian clock) has been suggested as a
mechanism that regulates myocardial metabolic genes ie,
alterations in gene expression depending on the light/dark
cycle.60
fenofibrates are ppar-␣ ligands that activate both ppar␤/␦ and ppar-␣ targets.61 ppar-␤/␦ and ppar-␣ regulate
similar genes in cardiac remodeling44 and share comparable
functions in cardiac fatty acid oxidation.62 the role of
ppar-␤/␦ is unclear in cardiac remodeling. on one hand,
ppar-␤/␦ agonists inhibit cardiac hypertrophy15 and on the
other hand, a ppar-␤/␦ deficiency promotes cardiomyopathy, lv dysfunction, and lipid accumulation.63 ppar-␣ and
ppar-␤/␦ regulate ucp3 gene expression in skeletal muscle
and the heart and mediate ucp3 regulation by free fatty
acids. when the heart is “stressed” by free fatty acid overload,
as in hf, ucp3 may favor free fatty acid and decreased
excessive reactive oxygen species production. thus, reduced
cardiac hypertrophy and lipid accumulation with  xxxd2096xxx 
are not due to increased fatty acid oxidation protein expression in our model.

 xxxd2096xxx  and aldosterone-induced hypertension

perspectives
 xxxd2096xxx  abrogated aldosterone-induced cardiac hypertrophy, independent of alterations in bp and pulmonary venous
congestion. it was associated with effects on the expression of
key factors involved in matrix turnover, resulting in decreased fibrosis and lipid accumulation in the myocardium.
although speculative, coordinated inhibition of myocardial
fibrosis and effects on metabolism warrant further study and
may be beneficial in hypertension-mediated diastolic
dysfunction.
