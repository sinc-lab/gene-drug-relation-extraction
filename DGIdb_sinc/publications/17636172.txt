abstract
acth has been shown to stimulate androgen production by the fetal/neonatal mouse testis through the melanocortin type 2
receptor ( xxxg1385xxx ). this study was designed to localize the expression of  xxxg1385xxx  in the neonatal mouse testis and characterize the
effects of acth on testicular androgen production. using immunohistochemistry,  xxxg1385xxx  was localized to the fetal-type leydig
cell population of the neonatal testis. acth caused a time-dependent increase in  xxxd1773xxx  (camp) and testosterone production
by isolated cells with an increase in camp apparent in !3 min. there was no additive effect of maximally stimulating doses of
acth and human  xxxd2228xxx  (hcg). androgen production in response to acth and hcg was reduced by uo126
and dexamethasone, which are the inhibitors of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and  xxxg1759xxx  respectively. expression of mrna encoding star
was increased fourfold by both acth and hcg, although expression of mrna encoding for steroidogenic enzymes was not
markedly affected. the potency of n-terminal fragments of acth to stimulate androgen production was similar to that seen
previously in the adrenal. data indicate that both lh and acth, acting through their respective receptors, stimulate
steroidogenesis by fetal-type leydig cells via  xxxd208xxx ,  xxxg1836xxx , and  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation of star.

introduction
 xxxg1801xxx  (acth) regulates corticosteroid output from the adrenal cortex through
interaction with the melanocortin type 2 receptor
( xxxg1385xxx ). outside of the adrenal cortex,  xxxg1385xxx  expression
has been described previously in murine adipocytes
(cammas et al. 1997) and we have shown recently that
the receptor is also expressed in the mouse fetal testis
(o’shaughnessy et al. 2003). the testicular receptors
appear to be functionally active since acth will
stimulate testosterone production by the fetal and
neonatal mouse testis which both contain fetal-type
leydig cells although the effects are lost in the
postpubertal animal (o’shaughnessy et al. 2003).
androgen production by the fetal and neonatal mouse
testis is dependent upon the fetal population of leydig
cells, which persists into early neonatal life and is
responsive to luteinizing hormone (lh; o’shaughnessy
et al. 2005). the effects of acth on fetal/neonatal
androgen production could be directly mediated
through melanocortin receptors on the fetal-type leydig
cells or indirectly mediated through another cell type.
this second possibility is supported by the presence of

paracrine factors in the fetal testis, which stimulate
leydig cell function (el-gehani et al. 1998, 2001). this
study was designed, therefore, to localize expression of
 xxxg1385xxx  in the neonatal testis (which contains fetal-type
leydig cells) and, thereafter, to characterize the direct
effects of acth stimulation of the testis.

materials and methods
animals
normal mice were bred at the university of glasgow
veterinary school and maintained as required under
united kingdom home office regulations. the mice used
were derived from f1 hybrids of c3h/heh and 101/h
strains. for all studies, the animals were aged 2 or 3 days
after birth with the day of birth designated as day 1.
cell isolation and incubation
dispersed testicular cells were prepared by collagenase
treatment of whole testes as previously described
(stalvey & payne 1983). the testes from four to eight
animals were dispersed at 37 8c in dmem/f12

containing 1 mg/ml collagenase (worthington cls type
4, purchased from lorne laboratories ltd, twyford, uk;
stalvey & payne 1983) and isolated cells were filtered
through a nylon sieve with a pore size of 50 mm. the
proportion of leydig cells in the cell preparations was
3–5% when tested by staining for 3b-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase activity (payne et al. 1980) although this
parameter was not routinely measured in all samples.
aliquots of isolated cells (1 ml total) were incubated for
up to 18 h at 37 8c in dmem/f12 in an atmosphere of
5% co2 and in the presence of varying concentrations of
human  xxxd2228xxx  (hcg) or acth peptide
fragments (sigma–aldrich co ltd). in experiments
designed to measure camp production, isobutyl methyxanthine (sigma–aldrich) was included in the incubation
medium at a concentration of 0.1 mm. in experiments to
study the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
erk or  xxxd208xxx  (aa) in the steroidogenic
response to tropic hormone stimulation, the cells were
preincubated for 30 min with uo126 (calbiochem,
merck biosciences ltd, nottingham, uk), which is a
specific inhibitor of erk (davies et al. 2000) or
dexamethasone, which is a  xxxg1759xxx  (pla2)
inhibitor (blackwell et al. 1978). tropic hormone was
added after the preincubation period and the cells were
incubated with inhibitor and hormone together for 3 h.
at the end of the incubation period, cells and medium
were placed in a heating block at 100 8c for 5 min and
the medium collected after centrifugation at 4000 g for
10 min. to measure the changes in gene expression,
cells and medium were separated at the end of the
incubation by centrifugation at 150 g and the cell pellet
stored in liquid n2.
rt and real-time pcr
total rna was extracted using trizol (life technologies).
isolated rna was reverse transcribed using random
hexamers and moloney murine leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase (superscript ii, invitrogen) as described
previously (o’shaughnessy & murphy 1993, o’shaughnessy et al. 1994).
to quantify the content of specific mrna species
in testicular cells following incubation in vitro with
hcg or acth, a real-time pcr approach was used,
which utilized the sybr green method following rt
of the isolated rna. real-time pcrs were performed
in a 96-well plate format using a stratagene mx3000
cycler. reactions contained 5 ml of 2!sybr mastermix (stratagene, amsterdam, the netherlands),
primer (100 nm), and template in a total volume of
10 ml. the thermal profile used for amplification was
95 8c for 8 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 8c for
20 s, 63 8c for 20 s, and 72 8c for 30 s. at the end of
the amplification phase, a melting curve analysis was
carried out on the products formed. negative

controls without rna were included in the rt and
subsequent real-time pcr studies.
primers for real-time pcr were designed using
parameters previously described (czechowski et al.
2004). the genes studied and primers used were:

immunohistochemistry
neonatal testes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 1 h, then washed in 70% ethanol, dehydrated, and
embedded in paraffin. sections (5 mm) were mounted
on glass slides, dewaxed, and rehydrated. endogenous
biotin was blocked using an avidin/biotin blocking kit
(r&d systems europe ltd, abingden, uk) and sections
were incubated with primary antibody overnight at
4 8c. the antibodies used were rabbit anti-mouse
 xxxg1385xxx  (alpha diagnostic, supplied by autogen
bioclear, calne, wiltshire, uk) and rabbit anti-bovine
 xxxg570xxx  (gift from ah payne). sections were washed
and incubated for 30 min with biotinylated secondary
antibody (r&d systems europe ltd). bound antibody
was visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (r&d systems europe ltd). negative
controls without the primary antibody were included
in each experiment.

ria
levels of testosterone in incubation medium were
measured by ria as previously described
(o’shaughnessy & sheffield 1990). levels of camp
were measured using a commercial assay system
(amersham biosciences).

statistical analysis
changes in camp levels over time were analyzed by
one-tailed t-tests as basal levels were undetectable.
other statistical analysis was by two-factor anova
using log-transformed data followed by individual t-tests
using the pooled error from the initial analysis.

results
localization of  xxxg1385xxx  expression in neonatal testis
using immunohistochemistry, expression of  xxxg1385xxx  in the
neonatal testis was limited to the interstitial tissue
(fig. 1a). labeling of an adjacent section with the leydig
cell marker  xxxg570xxx  indicated that the same cells were
expressing both  xxxg1385xxx  and  xxxg570xxx  (fig. 1b). a small
number of cells appeared to express  xxxg570xxx  but not
 xxxg1385xxx  and this may be an indication that not all fetal-type
leydig cells express  xxxg1385xxx . all the cells expressing  xxxg1385xxx 
appeared to express  xxxg570xxx . no immunohistochemical
staining for  xxxg1385xxx  was seen in the adult testis (not shown).
testicular response to acth
incubation of isolated neonatal testicular cells with
acth or hcg led to a time-dependent increase in
testosterone production in response to both hormones
(fig. 2a). responses to acth and hcg were identical up
to 7 h and varied little up to 18 h (fig. 2a). the response
to acth was rapid with an increase in testosterone
production seen within 5 min (fig. 2b). changes in
camp levels in response to acth were also very rapid
with an increase in cyclic nucleotide apparent within
3 min (fig. 2c). to determine whether erks1/2 are
involved in the steroidogenic response of fetal-type
leydig cells to acth and hcg cells were incubated with
the specific inhibitor uo126. in the presence of uo126,
there was a reduction in basal androgen production and

antibody. results show that the same cells in adjacent sections are
stained with both antibodies (arrows). control sections with no primary
antibody did not show staining (inset to a).

then stimulated with acth (10k7 m), hcg (10k9 m), or 22rhydroxycholesterol (20 mm) for 3 h. (b) cells isolated from neonatal
testes were preincubated with the pla2 inhibitor dexamethasone (up to
10k6 m) and then stimulated with acth, hcg, or 22r-hydroxycholesterol as above. *p!0.05 compared with appropriate control. these
studies have been repeated twice.

(fig. 3). basal steroidogenesis was not affected by
dexamethasone although both acth- and hcg-stimulated production was inhibited at the highest dose of
dexamethasone (fig. 3). steroidogenesis in the presence
of 22r-hydroxycholesterol (22rohc), which bypasses
the second messenger systems to deliver cholesterol
directly to the mitochondrion, was unaffected by the
presence of uo126 or dexamethasone (fig. 3).

effect of acth peptide fragments on leydig cell
steroidogenesis
to determine whether the leydig cell  xxxg1385xxx  shows the
same relative sensitivity to acth peptide fragments as
the adrenal  xxxg1385xxx  (vinson et al. 1986, hinson &
birmingham 1987) neonatal testicular cells were
incubated with acth (1–24), (1–17) and (1–16;
fig. 4a). the cells were most responsive to acth
(1–24) with responsiveness to acth (1–17) and (1–16)

about 100- and 1000-fold less respectively. addition
of maximally stimulating doses of both acth and
hcg caused no further increase in testosterone
production when compared with each hormone alone
indicating that there was no apparent additive effect
of the hormones once the cells were maximally
stimulated (fig. 4b).
acute effects of acth and hcg on fetal leydig cell gene
expression
to determine whether hcg and acth stimulate
similar changes in short-term gene expression in the
neonatal testis, isolated cells were incubated with hcg
or acth for 5 h and expression of three key leydig
cell genes measured. in cells incubated with acth or
hcg, there was a small but significant increase in
 xxxg570xxx  mrna levels, no significant change in  xxxg573xxx 
and a fourfold increase in star mrna levels (fig. 5).
there was no difference in the response of the cells to
hcg or acth.

discussion
five types of melanocortin receptor have been identified
to date, each with characteristic affinity for the different
melanocortins derived from  xxxg1801xxx 
(abdel-malek 2001). in previous studies, we have
shown that acth acts on the testis through  xxxg1385xxx 
(o’shaughnessy et al. 2003) and the immunohistochemical data presented here show that  xxxg1385xxx  expression is
restricted to the interstitial tissue and to cells expressing
 xxxg570xxx . since  xxxg570xxx  expression in the testis is
restricted to the leydig cells (wang et al. 2003), it is clear
that  xxxg1385xxx  is a leydig cell product. it has been reported
recently that  xxxg1385xxx  is expressed in both the gonocytes
and the interstitial tissue of the fetal mouse testis (nimura
et al. 2006). our immunohistochemical and functional
data agree with the interstitial localization of  xxxg1385xxx  and
suggest strongly that the leydig cells are the site of
interstitial expression. we did not, however, observe
staining of  xxxg1385xxx  in the germ cell component. there is
no clear explanation for this discrepancy although the
animals used in this study were about 3 days older
than those used previously (nimura et al. 2006) and it
is possible that gonocyte expression is lost as the
cells move into the neonatal phase of proliferation
(baker & o’shaughnessy 2001). other studies have
shown that acth can stimulate aromatase activity in
neonatal sertoli cells suggesting  xxxg1385xxx  could be
expressed in these cells (boitani et al. 1989). sertoli
cells were, however, equally responsive to other
melanocortins (a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone
(msh) and bmsh) indicating that this effect is not
mediated through  xxxg1385xxx  but another melanocortin
receptor (abdel-malek 2001).
during development, two populations of leydig cells
arise sequentially. the fetal-type leydig cells arise soon
after testis differentiation in the mouse and are
www.reproduction-online.org

1185

subsequently replaced by the adult population, which
starts to develop in the postnatal, prepubertal period
(baker et al. 1999, nef et al. 2000). the adult leydig cell
population is primarily responsive to lh and, in the
absence of lh, cell numbers fail to develop and
androgen production is minimal (cattanach et al.
1977, baker & o’shaughnessy 2001, ma et al. 2004).
the fetal leydig cells are also responsive to lh but,
unlike the adult population, lh is not essential for fetal
leydig cell development and function (o’shaughnessy
et al. 1998, zhang et al. 2004). results from this study
now show that the fetal-type leydig cells are also directly
responsive to acth. in contrast, the postpubertal testis is
not responsive to acth and  xxxg1385xxx  expression is
minimal indicating that acth has no effect on the
adult leydig cell (o’shaughnessy et al. 2003). in contrast
to the mouse, earlier studies have reported that adult
rabbit and guinea pig testes (but not rat, dog or hamster)
will increase testosterone in response to acth (juniewicz et al. 1988). this suggests that the adult leydig cells
may also express  xxxg1385xxx  in these species or there is
persistence of significant numbers of fetal leydig cells
into the adult testes.
it is well established that camp is a critical second
messenger in the lh-dependent stimulation of leydig cell
steroidogenesis. it has, for example, been shown that
lh/hcg causes rapid stimulation of camp production
and that dibutyryl camp stimulates testosterone production through activation of star protein (saez 1994,
stocco 2001). results from this study show that acth
causes a rapid stimulation of camp production within
3 min and before testosterone production is apparent. it is
likely, therefore, that both lh/hcg and acth stimulate
steroidogenesis through camp-dependent pathways. it is
known that camp activates  xxxg1836xxx  (pka), which
in turn, activates star protein (stocco 2001). recent
studies suggest, however, that camp activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2
might also play a role in stimulation of adult leydig cell
steroidogenesis (martinelle et al. 2004). using the
specific erk inhibitor uo126, our data show that the
transduction of signal from the lh-receptor or  xxxg1385xxx 
through the erk cascade contributes to steroidogenic
activity in the fetal mouse leydig cell. effects of uo126
were only seen at the higher concentrations of inhibitor,
but this is similar to the effects of uo126 on rat leydig
cells (martinelle et al. 2004) and reflects sensitivity of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 to uo126 inhibition.
in addition to the pathways described above, there is
also abundant evidence that aa can mediate tropic
hormone signal transduction in steroidogenic cells
(stocco et al. 2005). thus, g protein or camp can activate
pla2, which in turn, catalyzes aa release from phospholipids and leads to the activation of star (wang et al.
2000). it has been shown that lh can induce aa release in
rat leydig cells and inhibition of aa release from
phospholipids causes a marked inhibition of steroidogenesis (abayasekara et al. 1990, cooke et al. 1991). our data

h johnston and others

using the pla2 inhibitor dexamethasone show that a
component of the stimulatory effect of lh and acth on
androgen production by the fetal leydig cells may be
mediated through aa release from phospholipid. the
effects on hcg- and acth-stimulation were, however,
only seen at relatively high concentrations of inhibitor,
higher than those required to show inhibition of
steroidogenesis in ma-10 mouse leydig tumor cells
(wang et al. 2000). glucocorticoids can have direct
inhibitory effects on leydig cell steroidogenesis through
the activation of the  xxxg1601xxx  (bambino &
hsueh 1981, hales & payne 1989), although this is
unlikely in our studies because of the timescale of the
effects and because steroidogenesis was normal in the
presence of 22rohc. nevertheless, the relative insensitivity of fetal leydig cells to dexamethasone may be an
indication that the pathway through pla2 is relatively
minor in these cells.
in the adrenal, acth acts primarily through the
stimulation of camp, pka, and activation of star
although there is good evidence that acth can act
directly or downstream through the release of aa (cooke
1999). there is also evidence of activation through
 xxxg1369xxx /2 (ferreira et al. 2004) although this pathway is less
well documented in the adrenal. activation of these
pathways by acth in the fetal-type leydig cells is,
therefore, consistent with the effects of acth mediated
through  xxxg1385xxx  in the adrenal.
the signal pathways outlined above act to increase the
activity of preformed star and also act to increase
transcription of the star gene (stocco et al. 2005). thus,
increased expression of star mrna in neonatal mouse
testis by hcg and acth is consistent with both
hormones acting through similar signaling pathways in
mouse fetal leydig cells. it is known that lh acts to
regulate and maintain expression of  xxxg570xxx  in the
testis (malaska & payne 1984, mason et al. 1984, scott
et al. 1990) and studies using ma-10 cells have shown
that the effects of lh can be rapid (mellon & vaisse
1989). the effects of lh and acth on  xxxg570xxx  in the
isolated testicular cells reported here are consistent,
therefore, with these earlier studies. expression of  xxxg573xxx 
in the leydig cell has also been shown to be regulated by
lh (anakwe & payne 1987, baker et al. 2003) and the
effects of camp on expression have been shown to be
rapid in ma-10 cells (laurich et al. 2002). it is not clear,
therefore, why no increase in  xxxg573xxx  was seen in the
present study although it is possible that increasing
androgen levels in the medium may have inhibited
 xxxg573xxx  expression (hales et al. 1987).
results from this study show that the fetal leydig cells
are responsive to both lh and acth and both hormones
appear to act on the cell through similar mechanisms. in
animals lacking either lh (or lh-receptor) or acth,
fetal testosterone production is normal (o’shaughnessy
et al. 1998, 2003, ma et al. 2004, zhang et al. 2004)
although studies using the t/erb-null mouse indicate that
reproduction (2007) 133 1181–1187

the fetal pituitary is required for normal fetal leydig cell
function (pakarinen et al. 2002). it is possible, therefore,
that lh and acth may act to regulate leydig cell
function in a redundant fashion.
