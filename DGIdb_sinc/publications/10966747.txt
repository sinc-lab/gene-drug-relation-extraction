in our efforts to identify molecules that might act as cocaine antagonists or cocaine partial
agonists, efforts were made to further capitalize on our earlier finding regarding the ability of
a 7-methoxylated  xxxd1736xxx  analogue to act as a weak cocaine functional antagonist. herein,
a series of the 6- and 7-hydroxylated win analogues possessing a boat or chair conformation
of the tropane ring were prepared and tested for their ability to displace [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding
and to inhibit high-affinity monoamine uptake into rat brain nerve endings. these 6- and
7-hydroxylated win analogues were readily prepared by use of a classical willstätter synthesis
to construct an appropriately functionalized tropane ring followed by use of a suzuki coupling
reaction to introduce the aryl group at position 3. reduction of the resulting tropene by use of
smi2 or by catalytic hydrogenation followed by deprotection delivered the final target
compounds. some of these compounds were found to retain considerable affinity as inhibitors
of the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) and the  xxxg2148xxx  (net), but they were
less potent inhibitors of the serotonin transporter (sert). none of the compounds of the present
series revealed any substantial potency difference in [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding versus [3h]da
uptake, and failed to show “cocaine antagonism” when tested for their ability to prevent cocaine’s
inhibition of da transport. however, one of these hydroxylated win analogues, namely 12b,
which possesses nanomolar potency at the dat and net and micromolar potency at the sert,
when tested in vivo, was found capable of attenuating cocaine’s locomotor activity (ad50 ) 94
mg/kg). taken together, this work provides further support for our hypothesis that drugs that
lack the ability to inhibit transport by all three monoaminergic transporters may exhibit
“partial” cocaine-like properties, but act as cocaine antagonists. consequently, it may prove
valuable to examine the behavioral activity of other 6- and 7-substituted tropanes in animal
behavioral paradigms in the search for a cocaine medication.
introduction
immediate therapies are needed for the treatment of
cocaine abuse worldwide.1 it has been estimated, for
example, that there are at present over 1.5 million
cocaine abusers in the united states alone, and that
approximately one-third of these users are consistent
or hard core users. undoubtedly, cocaine abuse has a
tremendous negative impact on our society, for it has
been estimated that the health and crime costs associated with cocaine abuse amount to about 100 billion
dollars per year. moreover, it has been reported that
approximately one-half million americans ended up in
hospital emergency rooms last year. cocaine use figured
into about 28% of these emergency visits, up by 15%
from 1993. at present there are no effective medications
available to treat cocaine addiction, although selegeline
is in phase iii trials.1
to develop agents that might find use in the treatment of cocaine abuse, the search for both cocaine

antagonists and partial agonists is being pursued. while
antagonists are more likely to find use in situations of
cocaine overdose, the partial agonist approach may
prove more useful in maintenance programs. compounds that possess the ability to mimic partially the
effects of cocaine may help to maintain individuals in
treatment programs in a manner analogous to methadone, a drug widely used in the treatment of opiate
abuse. alternatively, or in addition, such “partial agonists” may be able to prevent the effects of cocaine.
in pursuit of possible medications we have focused
much of our chemistry efforts on the modification of
cocaine itself, in the belief that appropriate structural
alterations may lead to the desired type of partial
agonist or antagonist activity we seek. in fact, some time
ago we reported the ability of a 7-methoxylated analogue
of  xxxd1736xxx  to act as weak antagonist of cocaine,
in that it was able to inhibit cocaine’s ability to block
dopamine reuptake.2 based upon this interesting finding, it became attractive to investigate the activity of
other 6- and 7-substituted cocaine analogues. in particular, we chose to explore these modifications in the
higher affinity win series, in which the 3-position of

the tropane ring bears phenyl in place of cocaine’s
benzoate group. while we have reported to date on the
synthesis of a variety of such 6- and 7-substituted tropanes through use of an oxidopyridinium-based cycloaddition strategy, we found this method to be cumbersome in achieving our present objective, which was the
construction of all possible 6- and 7-substituted tropanes
of both chair and boat conformation.3 herein, we report
on the chemical synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a series of hydoxylated win derivatives,
and in one case we also present data showing the ability
of one of these derivatives to antagonize cocaine’s
stimulant effects in a rat locomotor assay. as will
become apparent, the present work provides further
support for our hypothesis that drugs that lack the
ability to inhibit transport by all three monoaminergic
transporters may exhibit only “partial” cocaine-like
properties.4 that is, drugs that are selective for sert
and net, or dat and net, or sert and dat may
have properties that could act either alone or in combination with an “antagonist” to reduce cocaine selfadministration.
chemistry. in terms of developing a chemical approach to the 6- and 7-substituted win analogues, we
initially attempted to use cocaine itself, investigating
the possibility to bring about the remote functionalization of this molecule by tethering appropriate functionality to the nitrogen atom. unfortunately, such efforts
did not meet with success. we then modifed our approach by adapting the route devised by willstätter
nearly eight decades ago for the synthesis of cocaine
itself.5 the chemical route used to generate the required
6- and 7-hydroxylated tropinones is shown in scheme
1, and it resembles closely the approach we first used
to prepare the methoxylated  xxxd1736xxx  derivative
metioned in the introduction.6
accordingly, commercially available 2,5-dimethoxy2,5-dihydrofuran (1) was stirred in 3 n hcl overnight
at room temperature and then neutralized by the
addition of 6 n naoh. this mixture was then added to
a solution of acetonedicarboxylic acid, methylamine
hydrochloride, and sodium acetate in water (ph approximately 4.3). the resulting mixture was then stirred
for 2 days at room temperature. the crude product thus
obtained was recrystallized from  xxxd2400xxx  to afford
 xxxd1946xxx -hydroxytropinone (5) as a white solid in 42% yield.

zhao et al.

the hydroxytropinone 5 was protected in turn as its
tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether 6 using tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride and imidazole in dmf at room temperature for 12 h. this intermediate then was deprotonated
with lithium diisopropylamine (lda) in the same manner as described by majewski for tropinone.7 ketone 6
was treated with lda in thf at -78 °c, and the
resulting enolate was reacted with methyl cyanoformate
to afford the corresponding racemic carbomethoxylated
derivatives 7 and 8 in 64% yield and in a ratio of 9:7.
the two isomers can be separated by careful flash
column chromatography, and the structure of compound
7, which exists as its enol after removal of the tbdms
group, was assigned by x-ray analysis.8 the keto esters
7 and 8 served as key intermediates in the synthesis of
6- and 7-hydroxylated win type analogues of cocaine.
from this point, a suzuki coupling protocol was used
to install the tolyl group following a protocol much like
that first reported by carroll in his synthesis of other
cocaine analogues.9 hence, the enol triflate 9 was
readily obtained in 73% yield by the addition of nphenyltrifluoromethanesulfonimide to a thf solution
of ketone 7 containing sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide
at -78 °c (scheme 2). reaction of 9 with 4-methylphenylboronic acid, which was prepared from triisopropyl
borate,10 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane using tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) as catalyst together with
 xxxd3212xxx  and lithium chloride at reflux gave
10 in 98% yield.
reduction of 10 with samarium iodide in thf at -78
°c using methanol as the proton source followed by
quenching with acetic acid provided a mixture of the
desired tropanes 11a (22.5%), 12a (32.5%), 13a (17.5%),
and 14a (12.5%) in a total yield of 85%. these products
are readily separable by flash column chromatography.
on the other hand, hydrogenation of 10 over 10% pd/c
in methanol gives rise to a single product in 80% yield
to which we assign 2r,3r-stereochemistry (compound
14a) in accordance with literature precedent.11 under
basic conditions (naome, meoh, reflux, 24 h; 83%), 14a
is converted to the more stable 2beta,3r-isomer 12a.
compounds 11a and 13a are therefore the other two
isomers. since 11a epimerizes to 13a with naome in
methanol, 13a must be the 2r,3beta-isomer, and 11a the
2beta,3beta-isomer.
finally, the tbdms group of each of the compounds
11a, 12a, and 13a was removed in high yield with
n-bu4nf in thf at room temperature to give the
corresponding products 11b-13b (87, 99, and 85%,
respectively). however, when compound 14a was treated
with n-bu4nf in thf, only 12b was obtained as the
product. to avoid this epimerization, which was obviously a consequence of the basicity of the fluoride anion,
compound 14a was instead deprotected with 48% hf
to afford 7beta-hydroxy-3r-(p-tolyl)tropane-2r-carboxylic
acid methyl ester (14b) in 79% yield. the structure of
12b was confirmed by x-ray analysis (figure 1).
to access the 7r-epimers, the tbdms group of
compound 10 was removed with n-bu4nf in thf at
room temperature. the resulting alcohol 15 (91% yield)
was subjected to a swern oxidation,12 which delivered
the ketone 16 in 97% yield. reduction of 16 with nabh4
in methanol gave a 15:1 mixture of the alcohols 17 and
15 in 91% yield. these two compounds were readily

separated by flash chromatography, and the structure
of 17 was established by x-ray analysis (figure 1).
attempts at saturating the double bond in the free
alcohol 17 with smi2 as described above were unsuccessful. therefore, compound 17 was converted to its
tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether 18, and this intermediate
was reacted with smi2 in thf/meoh. of the reduction
products, only the major isomer 19a was obtained in
pure form in 66% yield while the minor stereoisomers
formed an inseparable mixture. upon treatment with
naome in meoh at reflux, approximately 75% of this
mixture was converted to compound 19a. the remaining
material exhibited a complex 1h nmr spectrum and
was not further investigated. if the mixture of minor

products was deprotected with n-bu4nf in thf, most
of it was transformed into the lactone 20b. hydrogenation (40 psi) of 18 over 10% pd/c in methanol gave the
same lactone directly. we conclude that the predominant isomer among the minor products has 2r,3rconfiguration and that compound 19a has 2beta,3rconfiguration. the structure of 19a was subsequently
confirmed by x-ray crystallographic analysis (figure 1).
deprotection of 19a with n-bu4nf in thf provided the
desired compound 19b (scheme 3).
in the same manner as described above, compound 8
was converted into its enol triflate 21 in 62% yield,
which was coupled with p-tolylboronic acid to produce
the aryl olefin 22 in high yield (scheme 4). reduction

of 22 with smi2 at -78 °c in thf/meoh gave the
saturated tropane analogues 23a (38%), 24a (48%), and
25a (5%). intermediate 23a was converted to 25a in
high yield by treatment with naome in meoh at reflux.
hydrogenation of 22 over 10% pd/c, on the other hand,
provided the 2r,3r-isomer 26a exclusively. the structure of compound 24a was confirmed by x-ray analysis
(figure 1).13 finally, the tbdms group of each of the
compounds 23a, 24a, and 25a was removed in high yield
with n-bu4nf in thf to give the desired products 23b,
24b, and 25b, respectively. the remaining isomer 26b
was obtained in 92% yield by treatment of 26a with 48%
hf.
compounds of the 6r-series were prepared, like their
7r-isomers, by stereochemical inversion at the oxygenbearing carbon atom. thus, compound 22 was deprotected with n-bu4nf and the resulting alcohol 27
converted by swern oxidation to ketone 28, which upon
nabh4 reduction afforded 27 and its 6r-isomer 29 in a
ratio of 1:5.3. after hydroxyl protection as the silyl ether

30, the double bond was reduced with smi2 in thf/
meoh to afford the saturated products 31a (6%), 32a
(69%), and 33a (17%). hydrogenation of 30 gave the
2r,3r-isomer 34a in 89% yield. finally, all of these four
intermediates were deprotected with n-bu4nf or 48%
hf to give the desired products 31b-34b (scheme 5).
biology. all of the hydroxylated tropanes described
herein were tested for their ability to displace [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding.  xxxd2546xxx  has been shown to label the
cocaine binding site on the  xxxg2149xxx  of rat
striatal membranes.14 this ligand binds with high
affinity (kd ) 8.63 ( 0.53 nm) to a single, sodiumdependent site in striatal membranes, representing the
dopamine carrier. additionally, these compounds were
tested for their ability to inhibit high-affinity uptake of
da, 5-ht, and ne into nerve endings (synaptosomes)
which were prepared from various regions of the rat
brain that are enriched with the particular transporter
under study.15 comparison of the ki values for inhibition

tated by the use of the same buffer in all assays. the
binding and uptake data are provided in table 1 along
with comparison data for cocaine.
as is apparent from the accompanying table, of the
7-hydroxylated tropanes, only 11b and 12b, the former
with the chair conformation and the latter with the boat
conformation, were found to have nanomolar range
potencies in binding and uptake. the chair tropane 11b
is particularly potent, with a ki of 25 nm in  xxxd2546xxx 
binding. the dat and net potencies are comparable
(39 and 45 nm) and about 10-fold better than the sert
potency. on the other hand, the net potency of 12b is
2-fold better than its dat potency, while its sert
potency is in the 6 µm range. both of the 7beta-hydroxylated analogues 13b and 14b, which have an r-oriented ester group, exhibit only micromolar potencies at all
three transporters. the 7r-hydroxylated boat tropane
19b is less active than cocaine in the dat assay, with
a ki of about 0.7 µm, with very little activity being
shown by the lactone 20b. during the course of our
work, meltzer has also reported on the activity of some
7-hydroxylated win analogues, finding that a 7beta-

hydroxy-3r-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) substituted tropane has
both high affinity and selectivity for dat over the sert
(ic50 ) 1.2 nm vs 1390 nm). the chemical route used
by meltzer also makes use of the willstätter approach
first employed by us in combination with the suzuki
coupling chemistry.16
of the 6-hydroxylated compounds, only the tropane
23b of chair conformation had activity in the nanomolar
range (290 nm) at the dat, while all other 6-hydroxylated derivatives exhibited binding and uptake data
in the micromolar range. the net activity of 23b is also
good, while this compound shows poor activity at the
sert. compound 23b is thus dat + net selective.
from the present study one may make the observation that the  xxxd2546xxx  and da recognition sites are
more tolerable for the 6- and 7-hydroxylated tropanes
that possess a beta-oriented hydroxyl group. from a
structural standpoint, this is reasonable, as the nitrogen
atom and n-methyl group that make up the tropane
ring already provide some steric bulk to this face of the
seven-membered carbocycle, and the presence of the
extra hydroxy group causes little further “steric dis-

turbance”. also, for the three ligands showing 300 nm
or better dat potency, their sert potency is 15- to 50fold less. thus, the 6- or 7-hydroxy group causes a
reduction in activity at the sert in comparison to the
activity found for cocaine itself or for a 6/7-unsubsituted
win analogue. as can be seen from table 1, cocaine
shows better activity at the sert than the dat. data
are also provided for the win analogue 35 bearing an
r-oriented n-propyl group at the 2-position. the dat
and sert potencies are comparable in this case,
whereas the compound is more active at the net.
unfortunately, based upon a comparison of binding
and uptake data, it appeared that none of our hydroxylated win type compounds might act as a cocaine
antagonist by binding to the  xxxd2546xxx  site more avidly
than the da site on dat. even when tested as such, in
contrast to what we found previously for the 7rmethoxylated  xxxd1736xxx  analogue which possesses
low binding affinity, no functional antagonism was
observed.2a nonetheless, from our prior experience with
a dat/net-selective piperidine-based ligand that shows
no functional antagonism in vitro, but yet is able to
antagonize the effects of cocaine in vivo in locomotor
studies, we chose to scale-up two of the more active of
these compounds, 11b and 12b, to allow for in vivo
studies.2b compound 12b was chosen based both upon
its dat potency and its selectivity for the dat over the
sert.
locomotor study of 11b and 12b. tropanes 11b
and 12b were tested in nonhabituated male swisswebster mice in the locomotor assay using the standard
operating procedure developed by the medications development division of the national institute on drug
abuse. not unexpectantly, the more dat-potent ligand
11b had an efficacy similar to cocaine when it was tested
alone at a dose range of 3-100 mg/kg, and it was found
to stimulate locomotor activity with an ed50 value of
14.03 mg/kg and a maximal effect/cocaine miximal effect
ratio of 0.88. as a consequence of this activity profile,
11b was not tested for its ability to attenuate cocaineinduced locomotor activity. on the other hand, the less
dat-active ligand 12b proved to be more interesting.
figure 2 shows the average horizontal activity counts/
10 min as a function of time, immediately following
injection of 12b or vehicle. since 12b did not affect
spontaneous locomotor activity in the dose range finding
experiment, a cocaine interaction study was conducted
next. figure 3 shows the average horizontal activity
counts/10 min for the different treatment groups as a
function of time, starting 20 min after pretreatment
with 12b. the period of 0-30 min was selected for

time period in which cocaine produced its maximal
effects. figure 4 shows the average horizontal activity

condition, 20 min after pretreatment with 12b. the bar

the effects of 12b at the designated doses 20 min prior
to injection of 20 mg/kg cocaine. the mean average
horizontal activity counts/10 min on the descending
portion of the dose-effect curve (30 to 100 mg/kg dose
range) for this 30 min period were fit to a linear function
of log dose, and the ad50 (dose attenuating cocaineinduced stimulation by 50%) was calculated to be 94 mg/
kg. [the ordinate value for the ad50 was calculated
using the mean of the vehicle + 0.9% saline (vehicle)
group as the minimum value, and the mean of the
vehicle plus 20 mg/kg cocaine group as the maximum
value.]

asterisk). however, as the difference between the “no
effect” dose of 12b at 100 mg/kg alone and the antagonism result is only a difference of outcome at the 100
mg/kg dose, it is important that these studies be
extended further. nonetheless, the present results do
suggest that these hydroxylated tropanes are worthy
of further exploration.

conclusions
the present work details the synthesis of a series of
the 6- and 7-hydroxlated win analogues possessing a
boat or chair conformation of the tropane ring. some of
these compounds retain considerable dat and net
potency, with diminished activity at the sert. while
previously we had found that a methoxylated  xxxd1736xxx  analogue was able to antagonize cocaine’s
inhibition of dopamine reuptake, none of the compounds
of the present series revealed any substantial difference
in binding versus uptake, and they failed to show
“cocaine antagonism” when tested for such. however,
one of the hydroxylated win analogues, namely 12b,
was tested in vivo and found capable of attenuating
cocaine’s locomotor activity. when the compound was
tested alone at a dose range of 3-100 mg/kg, the
compound was found to have no effect on locomotor
activity. when tested in animals that had been treated
with 20 mg/kg (i.p.), 12b was able to attenuate locomotor activity with an ad50 of 94 mg/kg. in contrast,
locomotor studies using the more dat-active ligand 11b
revealed this compound to be cocaine-like in its action
(maximal effect/cocaine miximal effect ratio of 0.88).
the present finding suggests that it may prove
valuable to examine the behavioral activity of other 6and 7-substituted tropanes in animal behavioral paradigms in the search for a cocaine medication. of interest
in this connection is our related finding concerning the
action of 7r-fluoro-3r-(p-fluorophenyl)-2beta-propyltropane. this compound was evaluated in the brain
stimulation reward paradigm, a behavioral screen that
allows measuring the intrinsic hedonic properties of
compounds separately from the concomitant changes in
the rate of responding.17 the fluorinated tropane was
found to be unrewarding when administered alone, with
only a slight increase in reward at 20 mg/kg (i.p.), the
highest dose tested to date. however, when 5 mg/kg or
10 mg/kg i.p. of this tropane was combined with 10 mg/
kg cocaine (i.p.), a reduction in cocaine-induced rewardenhancement (by approximately 60%) was noted. no
changes in motor/performance capacity were observed,
either when the derivative was administered alone or
in combination with cocaine. like 12b, this fluorinated
tropane also shows better activity at the dat and net
versus the sert (49, 52, and 560, respectively).18
thus, taken together this work provides further
support for our hypothesis that drugs that lack the
ability to inhibit transport by all three monoaminergic
transporters may exhibit only “partial” cocaine-like
properties. it is our intention to further explore this
hypothesis using other tropanes showing varying levels
of transporter selectivity.
last, we call attention to the fact that the hydroxlated
tropanes reported herein have been made in racemic
form. based upon the encouraging behavioral results,
it is our plan to prepare the more potent compounds in

locomotor assay method. the dose range finding experiment for 12b was conducted according to the mdd locomotor
activity studies standard operating procedure (sop, nov. 13,
1992). the study was conducted using 16 digiscan locomotor
activity testing chambers (40.5 × 40.5 × 30.5 cm). panels of
infrared beams (16 beams) and corresponding photodetectors
were located in the horizontal direction along the sides of each
activity chamber. separate groups of eight nonhabituated male
swiss-webster mice were injected via the intraperitoneal (i.p.)
route with either vehicle ( xxxd2609xxx ) or 12b (10 or 100
mg/kg), immediately prior to locomotor activity testing. in all
studies, horizontal activity (interruption of 1 photocell beam)
was measured for 1 h within 10 min sample periods. testing
was conducted with one mouse per activity chamber.
