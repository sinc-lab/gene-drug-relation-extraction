abstract
receptor  xxxg2198xxx  activation contributes to cell viability during
cytotoxic therapy. the novel broad spectrum receptor  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor,  xxxd3264xxx , inhibits  xxxg1274xxx ,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor, c- xxxg1279xxx , and fetal liver tyrosine
kinase 3. in this study, we maintained  xxxd3264xxx  plasma levels beyond the
completion of radiotherapy to determine whether tumor regrowth can be
delayed. the antiangiogenic effects of  xxxd3264xxx  were demonstrated using
human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. apoptosis increased and
clonogenic survival decreased when  xxxd3264xxx  was used in combination
with radiation from 0 to 6 gy on endothelial cells. in vivo tumor growth
delay was increased in c57b6j mice with lewis lung carcinoma or
glioblastoma multiform (gl261) hind limb tumors. mice were treated
with daily i.p. injections (40 mg/kg) of  xxxd3264xxx  during 7 days of radiation
treatment (21 gy). combined treatment with  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation
significantly reduced tumor volume as compared with either treatment
alone. concomitant reduction in vasculature was confirmed using the
dorsal vascular window model. the vascular length established using
images taken from a consistent quadrant in the window show the combination therapy was more effective in destroying tumor vasculature than
either treatment alone.  xxxd3264xxx  maintenance administration beyond the
completion of radiotherapy results in prolongation of tumor control. in
summary,  xxxd3264xxx  enhances radiation-induced endothelial cytotoxicity,
resulting in tumor vascular destruction and tumor control when combined
with fractionated radiotherapy in murine tumor models. moreover, inhibition of angiogenesis well beyond radiation therapy may be a promising
treatment paradigm for refractory human neoplasms.

introduction
rtks3 and their ligands have been implicated in angiogenesis, and
current data suggest they are potential therapeutic targets. split-kinase
domain rtks, including pdgf receptor ␤,  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx , and fgf
receptor play important roles in tumor angiogenesis. the inhibition of
vegf by antibodies (1) and the use of  xxxg1274xxx  receptor antagonists have
been shown to have antiangiogenic effects (2). other rtk ligands,
including fgf and pdgf, also appear to contribute to angiogenesis
and tumor growth (3). the i.v. injection of basic fgf has been shown
to inhibit apoptosis in the microvasculature of mouse lungs exposed to
irradiation (4). fgf may indirectly contribute to angiogenesis by
up-regulation of vegf (5). pdgf also increases vegf secretion in

tumor cell lines (6). vegf, fgf, and pdgf are all up-regulated in
response to radiation (7, 8). these studies establish the important
therapeutic benefits that might be achieved through the inhibition of
rtks and their ligands.
 xxxd3264xxx  is a p.o. available indolinone-based synthetic molecule,
which was identified as a low nm-selective inhibitor of the angiogenic
rtks  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  in both biochemical and cellular
assays (9).  xxxd3264xxx  was also found to inhibit cellular signaling via
 xxxg1279xxx  and fetal liver  xxxg2198xxx  3.  xxxd3264xxx  exhibited broad and
potent antitumor activity in mice, regressing a431 human epidermoid
and colo205 human colon tumors, arresting the growth of h460
human lung, mda-mb-435 human breast, and  xxxg1682xxx -human prostate
tumors, and substantially delaying the growth of c6 rat and sf763t
human glioma xenografts (9). in colo205 tumors,  xxxd3264xxx  treatment
induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in tumor microvessel
density and tumor cell proliferation and an associated increase in
tumor cell apoptosis, culminating in tumor regression.
 xxxd3264xxx  is currently in phase i clinical trials in patients with
advanced cancer. pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies in mice
have shown that  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ␤ and  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation in a time- and dose-dependent fashion with target plasma
concentrations of 50 –100 ng/ml (9). sustained inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx /
 xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ␤ phosphorylation was not required for maximum
efficacy, as indicated by the demonstration that target receptor phosphorylation was suppressed for ⬃12 h at efficacious doses with daily
administration. in this study,  xxxd3264xxx  was therefore administered
twice daily to tumor-bearing mice when a constant efficacious dose
was required. the selectivity of  xxxd3264xxx  demonstrated against other
kinases in vitro is recapitulated in vivo by the fact that  xxxd3264xxx  does
not inhibit  xxxg682xxx  phosphorylation in vivo,
even at high plasma concentrations (9).
rtk antagonists have been shown to enhance the cytotoxic effects
of cancer therapy through the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol
3⬘-kinase/akt viability pathway in tumor vascular endothelium. in this
study, this broad spectrum rtk antagonist was administered to vascular endothelium to determine whether  xxxd3264xxx  enhances radiationinduced endothelial cytotoxicity. in separate experiments,  xxxd3264xxx 
was administered in a maintenance schedule to determine whether
tumor control can be maintained for prolonged time periods after
irradiation. these studies show that  xxxd3264xxx  enhanced radiationinduced tumor vascular endothelial destruction and improved tumor
control after the discontinuation of fractionated radiotherapy.
materials and methods

cell culture. huvecs were obtained from clonetics and were maintained
in ebm-2 medium supplemented with egm-2 mv singlequots (biowhittaker). the gl261 cell line was obtained from dr. yancy gillespie (university
of alabama, birmingham, al; ref. 10). gl261 cells were maintained in
dmem with nutrient mixture f-12 1:1 (life technologies, inc.) with 7%
fcs, 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% sodium pyruvate. llc cells were
obtained from american type tissue culture (11) and were maintained in
high-glucose (4.5 g) dmem supplemented with 10% fcs and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. all cells were incubated in a 37°c in a 5% co2 incubator.

 xxxd3264xxx  maintenance therapy prevents tumor regrowth

an eldorado 8 teletherapy 60co unit (atomic energy of canada limited)
was used to irradiate endothelial cell cultures at a dose rate of 0.84 gy/min.
delivered dose was verified by use of thermoluminescence detectors.
viability assays. the number of cells undergoing apoptosis was quantified
by microscopic analysis of apoptotic nuclei. cells were then fixed and stained
with h&e at 24 h after treatment with 6 gy radiation and/or 100 nm  xxxd3264xxx .
cells were then examined by light microscopy. for each treatment group, five
high power fields (⫻40 objective) were examined, and the number of apoptotic
and total cells was determined. from these numbers, the percentage of apoptotic cells for each group was determined.
clonogenic survival analysis was performed as we have described previously (2). briefly, huvec culture plates were treated at each radiation dose
level with/without 1 ␮m  xxxd3264xxx  for 1 h before irradiation. after treatment
with radiation and/or antagonist, cells were trypsinized, counted by hemocytometer, and subcultured into fresh medium. after 14 days, the cells were fixed
with cold methanol and stained with 1%  xxxd2610xxx . colonies with ⬎50
cells were counted, and the surviving fraction was determined.
western immunoblots. huvecs were treated with 100 nm  xxxd3264xxx  for
1 h and/or irradiated with 6 gy. huvecs were washed twice with pbs and
lysis buffer (20 nm tris, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 1% triton x-100, 2.5 mm
na pp, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 ␮g/ml leupeptin) added.
protein concentration was quantified by the bio-rad method. twenty ␮g of
total protein were loaded into each well and separated by 8 or 12% sds-page
gel, depending on the size of the target protein being investigated. the proteins
were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (hybond ecl; amersham,
arlington heights, il) and probed with antibodies to  xxxg341xxx  and caspase
3-cleaved fragment (cell signaling).
tumor vascular window model. life technologies, inc., penicillinstreptomycin solution (200 ␮l) was injected into the hind limb of the mouse
before the procedure. the dorsal skin-fold window is a 3-g plastic frame
applied to the skin of the mouse and remains attached for the duration of the
study. the chamber was screwed together, whereas the epidermis was incised
and remained open with a plastic covering. the midline was found along the
back, and a clip was placed to hold the skin in position. a template, equivalent
to the outer diameter of the chamber, was traced, producing the outline of the
incision. a circular cut was made tracing the perimeter (7-mm diameter) of the
outline followed by a crisscross cut, thus producing four skin flaps. the
epidermis of the four flaps was then removed using a scalpel with an effort to
follow the hypodermis superior to the fascia. the area was then trimmed with
fine forceps and iris scissors. the template was removed, and the top piece of
the chamber was fixed with screws. during surgery, the area was kept moist by
applying moist drops of pbs with 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. the
bottom portion of the chamber was put in place, and the top was carefully
positioned on the cut side so that the window and the circular incision were
fitted. antibiotic ointment was applied at this time. the three screws that held
the chamber together were then positioned into the chamber holes and tightened so that the skin was not pinched, thus avoiding diminished circulation.
tumor blood vessels developed in the window within 1 week.
we studied the time- and dose-dependent response of tumor blood vessels
to radiation using the window model. vascular windows were treated with 3
gy of superficial x-rays using 80 kvp (pantak x-ray generator). five mice
were studied in each of the treatment groups.  xxxd3264xxx  (40 mg/kg) was
injected i.p. 15 min before irradiation. the window frame was marked with
coordinates, which were used to photograph the same microscopic field each
day. vascular windows were photographed using ⫻4 objective to obtain a ⫻40
total magnification. color photographs were used to catalogue the appearance
of blood vessels on days 0 –7. photographs were scanned into photoshop
software, and vascular center lines were positioned by imagepro software and
verified by an observer blinded to the treatment groups. tumor blood vessels
were quantified by the use of imagepro software, which quantifies the vascular
length density of blood vessel within the microscopic field. center lines were
verified before summation of the vascular length density. the mean and 95%
confidence intervals of vascular length density for each treatment group were
calculated, and variance was analyzed by the general linear models and
bonferroni t test.
tumor growth delay assays. c57bl/6 mice received s.c. injections in
the right thigh with 106 viable cells of a murine glioblastoma (gl261) or lung
carcinoma (llc) suspended in 0.2 ml of a 0.6% solution of agarose. each set
of six mice was stratified into four groups on day 1 ( xxxd3264xxx  vehicle control,

radiation,  xxxd3264xxx , and  xxxd3264xxx  ⫹ radiation) to control for mean tumor
volume. an equal number of large- and intermediate-sized tumors were present
in each group. mouse tumors were stratified into groups so that the mean tumor
volume of each group was comparable. mean tumor volumes for llc were
425 ⫾ 40, 420 ⫾ 40, and 432 ⫾ 45 mm3 and for gl261 were 530 ⫾ 50,
510 ⫾ 35, and 535 ⫾ 55 mm3 for groups of tumors treated with radiation
alone,  xxxd3264xxx  alone, or  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation, respectively.
irradiated mice were immobilized in lucite chambers, and the entire body
was shielded with lead except for the tumor-bearing hind limb. radiation was
administered within 30 min of  xxxd3264xxx  (40 mg/kg) i.p. injection. a total dose
of 21 gy was administered to the appropriate mice in seven fractionated doses
of 3 gy on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, the first dose being administered on day
1. tumor volumes were measured three times weekly using skin calipers as
described previously (12–14). the volumes were calculated from a formula
(a ⫻ b ⫻ c / 2) that was derived from the formula for an ellipsoid (␲d3 / 6).
data were calculated as the percentage of original (day 1) tumor volume and
graphed as fractional tumor volume ⫾ se for each treatment group.
for the maintenance study of  xxxd3264xxx , c57bl/6 mice bearing gl261 hind
limb tumors were stratified as described above into six groups. mean tumor
volumes were 320 ⫾ 28, 310 ⫾ 23, and 330 ⫾ 29 mm3 in groups treated with
radiation alone,  xxxd3264xxx  alone, or  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation, respectively.
radiation was administered within 30 min of  xxxd3264xxx  (40 mg/kg) i.p. injection. a total dose of 18 gy was given to the appropriate groups in six
fractionated doses of 3 gy on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. after day 8, three groups
received twice daily  xxxd3264xxx  injections (20 mg/kg, 8 h apart) for 7 days (days
9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, and 17), and after a 4-day interruption in therapy (days
18 –21), they were subsequently maintained for the remainder of the experiment. tumor volumes were assessed as above.
amplitude-modulated doppler blood flow analysis. blood flow within
these tumors was quantified by power doppler after the third fraction of
irradiation. tumor blood flow was imaged with a 10-5 mhz linear entos probe
attached to a hdi 5000 (probe and hdi 5000 from atl/philips, bothell, wa)
as we have described previously (15). power doppler sonography images were
obtained with the power gain set to 82%. a 20-frame cineloop sweep of the

entire tumor was obtained with the probe perpendicular to the long axis of the
lower extremity along the entire length of the tumor. color area was quantified
using hdi lab software (atl/philips). this software allows direct evaluation
of power doppler cineloop raw. the color area was recorded for the entire
tumor. five mice were entered into each treatment group. values for color area
were averaged for each tumor set, and treated groups were compared with
controls with the unpaired student t test.

microscopy of tumor sections. c57bl6 mice bearing llc tumors were
treated with 3 gy alone,  xxxd3264xxx  alone, or  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation. twentyfour h after treatment, tumors were fixed, sectioned, and stained. phosphorylation of the molecular target for  xxxd3264xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ␤, was studied by use of the
phospho-specific antibody (cell signaling). tunel staining was used to
identify apoptotic cells (deadend colorimetric tunel system, promega no.
g7130). sections were counterstained with antibody to the endothelial-specific
antigen  xxxg2423xxx  using rabbit anti-vwf, igg (dako, carpinteria,
ca). secondary antibody: peroxidase-labeled goat antirabbit igg, dako
stained with vector nova red substrate  xxxg1279xxx  (vector, burlingame, ca) sections

statistical analysis. we used the general linear model (logistic regression
analysis) to test for associations between the numbers of apoptotic cells present
in culture, clonogenic survival, tumor blood flow, and tumor volumes. we
applied the bonferroni method to adjust the overall significant level equals to

determined for each experimental group. fig. 1 shows the percentage
of cells undergoing apoptosis after treatment with  xxxd3264xxx  alone for
cells treated with  xxxd3264xxx  alone, 6 gy alone, or  xxxd3264xxx  followed
by 6 gy. untreated control cells show 2% apoptotic nuclei as compared with 7 and 8% after treatment with  xxxd3264xxx  or radiation,
respectively (p ⬎ 0.1). huvecs treated with  xxxd3264xxx  followed by
6 gy showed 21% of cells with apoptotic nuclei at 24 h, which was
significantly greater than either agent alone (p ⬍ 0.02) or untreated
control cells (p ⬍ 0.001). caspase activation was studied to verify the
role of apoptosis in the interaction between  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation.
fig. 1b shows the western immunoblot staining for  xxxg341xxx . this
shows that  xxxg341xxx  was not cleaved in endothelial cells after treatment with either  xxxd3264xxx  alone or radiation alone, whereas caspase
3 was cleaved in huvecs treated with  xxxd3264xxx  followed by irradiation.
prior studies have shown that vegf receptor antagonists enhance
the therapeutic effects of ionizing radiation (2, 7). to determine
whether enhanced apoptotic response in endothelial cells treated with
 xxxd3264xxx  results in reduced clonogenic cell survival, huvecs were
subcultured, and colony formation was quantified. fig. 2 shows the
surviving fraction of huvecs treated with vehicle or 1 ␮m  xxxd3264xxx 
before the indicated dose of radiation. there was no reduced plating
efficiency of huvecs treated with  xxxd3264xxx  alone. huvecs treated
with  xxxd3264xxx  before irradiation showed a significant reduction in
clonogenic survival as compared with radiation alone (ⴱ, p ⬍ 0.05).
growth factors produced by tumors could enhance the viability of
tumor vascular endothelium. to determine whether  xxxd3264xxx  enhances radiation-induced destruction of tumor vasculature,  xxxd3264xxx 
was administered to mice before irradiation with 3 gy. tumor vascular linear density was measured by use of intravital tumor vascular
window. fig. 3 shows the vasculature within llc tumors implanted
into the dorsal skin-fold window in c57bl6 mice. representative
photographs of tumor vasculature before and 48 h after treatment with
 xxxd3264xxx , 3 gy, or  xxxd3264xxx  followed by 3 gy indicate that rtk
inhibition increases tumor vascular destruction as compared with
either agent alone. five mice were treated in each of the treatment
groups, and the vascular length density after treatment was quantified.
mean vascular length densities over 4 days are shown as a bar graph.
within 72 h, vld in tumors was significantly reduced to 8% of that
at 0 h (p ⬍ 0.01). in comparison, tumors treated with either 3 gy or
 xxxd3264xxx  alone showed an insignificant reduction in vld to 75 and
84% that of 0 h, respectively. combined  xxxd3264xxx  and 3 gy achieved
significantly greater reduction in vld as compared with either agent
alone (p ⬍ 0.05).
destruction of tumor vasculature results in ischemia, which could
reduce radiosensitivity of tumors. to determine whether  xxxd3264xxx 
enhances tumor growth delay in irradiated tumors, mice bearing llc
and gl261 hind limb tumors were treated with i.p. injection of 40
mg/kg  xxxd3264xxx  or drug vehicle 30 min before each 3-gy dose of
radiation for a total of seven administrations. both the inhibitor and
radiation were discontinued after day 8 (arrows, fig. 4). the mean
fold increase in tumor volumes in five mice in each of the treatment
groups (vehicle,  xxxd3264xxx , vehicle ⫹ 21 gy, and  xxxd3264xxx  ⫹ 21 gy)
are shown. time to doubling of llc tumor size was 5, 6, 8, and 16
days for each group, respectively. both llc and gl261 tumors
showed a significant increase in tumor growth delay when  xxxd3264xxx 
was added before daily 3-gy fractions as compared with either agent
alone (ⴱ, p ⬍ 0.05).
the  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ␤ is one of the molecular targets for  xxxd3264xxx  (9).
phosphorylation of  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ␤ within tumor tissue, therefore, serves as
a biomarker for response to  xxxd3264xxx  in tumor models.  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ␤
phosphorylation was studied by use of the phospho-specific antibody
on immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections. fig. 4, c and d,

shows immunohistochemical staining of llc tumors with and without  xxxd3264xxx  administration. this shows that  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ␤ phosphorylation was detected in the stroma and endothelium of tumors before
treatment. at 3 h after  xxxd3264xxx  administration,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  phosphorylation could not be detected by immunohistochemistry (fig. 4d). this
indicates that  xxxd3264xxx  is biologically active within mouse tumor
models after systemic administration.
to determine whether prolonged growth delay correlated with
reduction in tumor blood flow, amplitude modulated power doppler
was used to monitor blood flow. fig. 5 shows representative images
of signal intensity of blood flow in gl261 tumors on day 5 of
treatment. reduced blood flow in tumors treated with  xxxd3264xxx  and
radiation correlated with the improved tumor growth delay that was
found in fig. 4. the bar graph shows the average blood flow within
gl261 tumors. tumors treated with  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation approached a significant reduction in blood flow as compared with
tumors treated with radiation alone (ⴱ, p ⬍ 0.053) and a trend toward
significance when compared with  xxxd3264xxx  alone (p ⫽ 0.15).
upon the discontinuation of therapy, tumors rapidly regrow. to
determine whether maintenance of  xxxd3264xxx  beyond the completion
of radiation improved growth delay, this rtk inhibitor was administered twice daily continuously in groups treated with radiation alone
or  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation. beginning after day 8 (fig. 6, arrow a),
three groups, one drug alone, one radiation ⫹ vehicle, and one
combined therapy were maintained with twice daily i.p. administrations of 20 mg/kg  xxxd3264xxx  for an additional 7 days. maintenance
treatment (main in fig. 6) was discontinued after day 17 (arrow b)

used to image microscopic blood flow in llc tumors implanted into the hind limb of
c57bl6 mice. shown are representative images of intensity of blood flow in tumors at
day 10 of treatment. tumors from those shown in fig. 4 were imaged on days 1 and 5 of
treatment. main indicates tumors that were treated with maintenance  xxxd3264xxx  alone
without irradiation. the bar graphs represent the average blood flow to the peripheral

 xxxd3264xxx  maintenance therapy prevents tumor regrowth

fig. 6. improved tumor growth delay by maintaining  xxxd3264xxx  after completion of
radiation. mice with gl261 hind limb tumors were treated with i.p. injection of 40 mg/kg
 xxxd3264xxx  or vehicle 30 min before each dose of radiation for a total of six administrations.
tumors were irradiated with 0 or 3 gy daily for six treatments (18 gy total). beginning
after day 8 (arrow a), three groups (drug alone, one radiation ⫹ vehicle, and one
combined therapy) were maintained (main) with twice daily i.p. administrations of 20
mg/kg  xxxd3264xxx  for 7 days. maintenance treatment was discontinued after day 17 (arrow
b) and subsequently resumed after 4 days of drug holiday (arrow c). shown are the means
of changes in tumor volumes in five mice in each of the treatment groups (vehicle control,
 xxxd3264xxx  alone, vehicle ⫹ 18 gy,  xxxd3264xxx  maintenance for 8 days ⫹ 18 gy,
 xxxd3264xxx  ⫹ 18 gy ⫹ maintenance therapy main). tumors were resected and sectioned at
24 h after treatment with (b) 3 gy, (c)  xxxd3264xxx , or (d)  xxxd3264xxx  and 3 gy. sections of
tumors were stained for apoptosis using brown tunel (brown arrows) and endothelial
cell marker using vwf red immunostaining (red arrows).

and subsequently resumed after 4 days of interruption of  xxxd3264xxx 
administration (arrow c). fig. 6 shows the means of changes in tumor
volumes in five mice in each of the treatment groups. each of the
maintenance groups showed significantly delay in growth to 4-fold
that of day 0 tumors (p ⬍ 0.05 in all groups). reinitiation of  xxxd3264xxx 
at day 21 (arrow c) produced a second phase of tumor growth delay.

rtk inhibition could affect either cancer cells or the vascular
endothelium within tumor microvasculature. to determine which cell
type contributes to radiation sensitization by  xxxd3264xxx , we studied
tunel staining of tissue sections from tumors treated with radiation,
 xxxd3264xxx , or  xxxd3264xxx  followed by irradiation. fig. 6 shows tunel

 xxxd3264xxx  maintenance therapy prevents tumor regrowth

sels. tumors treated with  xxxd3264xxx  alone or radiation alone developed
no tunel staining, whereas  xxxd3264xxx  followed by irradiation resulted in tunel staining positive in endothelial cells (fig. 6d). we
found no tumor cells staining positive with tunel stain after treatment with  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation.
discussion
local and regional recurrences continue to impact survival in many
neoplasms, especially malignant gliomas, head and neck cancer, and
lung cancer. this study addresses two strategies to improve tumor
control after radiotherapy. first, rtk antagonists attenuate signaling
through viability pathways in tumor vascular endothelium, resulting in
enhancement of cytotoxic effects. second, a maintenance schedule of
antiangiogenic therapy could prevent or delay progression of neoplastic growth.
although the predominant effect of  xxxd3264xxx  may be at the level of
tumor vascular endothelium,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  antagonists could prevent tumor
regrowth by direct effect on tumor cells. for example, the  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx 
inhibitor sti571 has been somewhat effective in treatment of solid
tumors (17, 18). several other human cancers may overexpress c- xxxg1279xxx 
or  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx , and clinical trials to evaluate the role of sti571 in the
treatment of such cancers are currently ongoing (17). sti571 inhibited
pdgf-mediated growth and lead to apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells in
vitro by selective inhibition of the  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx   xxxg2198xxx  (18).
although  xxxd3264xxx  could prevent tumor growth through inhibition of
tumor cell proliferation, in this study, apoptosis (tunel staining)
was limited to tumor vascular endothelial cells. this indicates that the
primary site of interaction between  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation was at the
vascular endothelium.
with regard to enhancement of cytotoxicity in tumor vascular
endothelium, we found reduced clonogenic survival in irradiated
endothelial cells pretreated with  xxxd3264xxx  as compared with radiation
alone. the proposed mechanism of interaction between rtk antagonists and cytotoxic therapy is the attenuation of signal transduction
through the phosphatidylinositol 3⬘-kinase/akt pathway (19). attenuation of this pathway alters the levels of bcl gene products, resulting
in increased susceptibility to apoptosis (20). this model of diminished
cell viability is supported by this study, which shows  xxxd3264xxx 
significantly increased radiation-induced apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells pretreated with the broad spectrum rtk antagonist
 xxxd3264xxx .  xxxg341xxx  was cleaved only in huvecs treated with both
 xxxd3264xxx  and radiation but not either agent alone. this suggests that
rtk inhibition, together with cytotoxic therapy, may be a beneficial
combination in cancer therapy. the enhancement in radiation-induced
cytotoxicity was also measured by clonogenic assay, which shows a
subtle, albeit significant reduction in surviving fraction of endothelial
cells. this interaction between  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation was minimized
by washing the kinase inhibitor off of cultures after 1-h incubation.
washing and feeding of cell cultures were required because colonies
will not form if this vegf receptor antagonist remains on cells during
clonogenic assays. taken together with positive tunel staining in
tumor endothelium, these data support the notion that apoptosis is one
mode of endothelial cell death when  xxxd3264xxx  is combined with
radiation.
tumors produce growth factors that could contribute to tumor
resistance to cytotoxic therapy. moreover, growth factors that activate
rtks on tumor microvascular endothelium include vegf, pdgf, as
well as others. this study addresses the contribution of rtk signaling
to radioresistance.  xxxd3264xxx  blocks signaling from a broad spectrum
of receptors, which could be advantageous (9). several methods have
been described to study microvessel density, including fluorescent
dyes (21) and vascular staining (22). two measures of tumor vascu-

lature (doppler and vascular window) were used to assess the effectiveness of  xxxd3264xxx  at enhancing radiation-induced tumor vascular
destruction. intravital tumor vascular window provided a measure of
vascular length density that was significantly reduced when  xxxd3264xxx 
was added before irradiation. this finding was supported by amplitude modulated doppler blood flow measurement, which showed
reduced microvascular blood flow when tumors were treated with
 xxxd3264xxx  together with radiation as compared with either agent alone.
taken together, these findings suggest that rtk inhibition enhances
the therapeutic effect of radiation, in part, through improved tumor
vascular destruction. the contribution of tumor vascular destruction
on tumor control is additionally supported by previous studies that
show antiangiogenic agents enhance radiation-induced tumor control
(2, 7, 16, 23–29). mechanisms of interaction between  xxxd3264xxx  and
radiation could involve increased cytotoxicity within vascular endothelium or within tumor cells. histological assessment of each of these
cellular components consisted of tunel staining, which showed
only vascular endothelial cells undergoing apoptosis while tumor cells
showed no response. this finding indicates that the predominant
mechanism of interaction between this vegf receptor antagonist and
radiation is within the tumor blood vessels.
diminished tumor blood flow results in hypoxia, which could
contribute to radioresistance (30). the effect of hypoxia could be
overcome by the concomitant reduction in nutrients and growth factors achieved by ischemia. to evaluate whether the ischemia induced
by  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation has an impact on tumor control, we studied
growth delay in hind limb tumors. this showed that destruction of
tumor vasculature correlates with improved growth delay as compared
with tumors treated with radiation alone. although hypoxia could
have a lessening effect upon the interaction between these agents,
there was a significant improvement in tumor growth delay.
upon completion of treatment with  xxxd3264xxx  and radiation, tumors
rapidly regrow.  xxxd3264xxx  was developed as an  xxxg482xxx 
(9). the study of maintaining  xxxd3264xxx  after the completion of radiation indicates that tumor growth delay can be improved by continuation of this  xxxg482xxx . this maintenance schedule significantly delayed regrowth as compared with tumors receiving no
maintenance  xxxd3264xxx . prior studies have shown that resumption of
antiangiogenic agents can again accomplished tumor control (31).
likewise, the resumption of  xxxd3264xxx  additionally delayed tumor
regrowth. the clinical significance of this schedule of administration
is that ongoing phase i trials show accumulation of  xxxd3264xxx  necessitating drug holidays. we found that resistance to antiangiogenic
therapy does not develop in mice bearing gl261 tumor grafts.
