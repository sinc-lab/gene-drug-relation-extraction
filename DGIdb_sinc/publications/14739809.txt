 xxxg1255xxx  (sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx ) form the vascular smooth muscle
 xxxg1253xxx .2,4 – 6
because katp channels are regulated by intracellular
atp, which binds to the  xxxg1250xxx  subunits,7 they are
thought to link cellular metabolism with membrane excitability.8,9 in addition, because native  xxxg1253xxx 
activators and inhibitors show variable tissue specificity,
the different types of cloned katp channels exhibit differential atp sensitivity and pharmacologic properties,
which are endowed by their different molecular composition of kir6 and sur subunits.4 in the heart and the
brain, the activation of both sarcolemmal and mitochondrial katp channels during short periods of preconditioning with ischemia (ischemic preconditioning) protect
myocardium and neural tissue from the following prolonged ischemia.10,11 in vascular smooth muscle, activation of sarcolemmal katp channels (sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx )
causes vasodilatation.12 therefore, great interest has
been focused on the effects of anesthetics on  xxxg1253xxx  activities. in the heart, volatile general anesthetics
activate katp channels,13–18 whereas intravenous general anesthetics except opioids19 –21 inhibit  xxxg1253xxx 
activities.22–25 we have studied the effects of propofol
and  xxxd3348xxx  on sarcolemmal  xxxg1253xxx  activities
using cell-attached and inside-out patch clamp configurations.24,25 propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  are both representative intravenous anesthetics that are used a great deal in
all types of anesthesia in patients who have coronary
artery disease and are undergoing a variety of surgical
procedures. in our previous studies,24,25 although both
propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  significantly inhibited  xxxg1253xxx  activities at high concentrations, propofol had no
significant effect, but  xxxd3348xxx  significantly inhibited
 xxxg1253xxx  activities at clinically relevant concentrations in isolated rat ventricular myocardium during
ischemia.
in the current study, to evaluate the differences of
actions on  xxxg1253xxx  activities between propofol and
 xxxd3348xxx  at the receptor level, we investigated the specificity of propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  on different types of
reconstitute katp channels expressed in katp-deficient
cos-7 cells (african green monkey kidney cells).

background: both propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  inhibit adenosine
triphosphate–sensitive potassium (katp) channels. in the current study, the authors investigated the effects of these anesthetics on the activity of recombinant sarcolemmal katp channels encoded by inwardly rectifying  xxxg1232xxx  ( xxxg1255xxx 
or  xxxg1250xxx ) genes and sulfonylurea receptor ( xxxg19xxx , sur2a, or
sur2b) genes.
methods: the authors used inside-out patch clamp configurations to investigate the effects of propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  on the
activity of recombinant katp channels using cos-7 cells transfected with various types of  xxxg1253xxx  subunits.
results: propofol inhibited the activities of the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx 
(ec50 ⴝ 77 ␮m), sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  (ec50 ⴝ 72 ␮m), and sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx 
(ec50 ⴝ 71 ␮m) channels but had no significant effects on the
sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx  channels. propofol inhibited the truncated isoform of  xxxg1250xxx  ( xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36) channels (ec50 ⴝ 78 ␮m) that can
form functional katp channels in the absence of sur molecules.
furthermore, the authors identified two distinct mutations
r31e (arginine residue at position 31 to  xxxd2431xxx ) and
k185q (lysine residue at position 185 to glutamine) of the
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 channel that significantly reduce the inhibition
of propofol. in contrast,  xxxd3348xxx  inhibited the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx 
(ec50 ⴝ 541 ␮m), sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  (ec50 ⴝ 248 ␮m), sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx 
(ec50 ⴝ 183 ␮m), sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx  (ec50 ⴝ 170 ␮m), and  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36
channels (ec50 ⴝ 719 ␮m). none of the mutants significantly
affects the sensitivity of  xxxd3348xxx .
conclusions: these results suggest that the major effects of
both propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  on  xxxg1253xxx  activity are mediated via the  xxxg1250xxx  subunit. site-directed mutagenesis study
suggests that propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  may influence  xxxg1250xxx  activity by different molecular mechanisms; in  xxxd3348xxx , the sur
subunit seems to modulate anesthetic sensitivity.

 xxxd83xxx  (atp)–sensitive potassium
(katp) channels are composed of two different types of
protein subunits, i.e., a sulfonylurea receptor (sur) and
an inwardly rectifying k⫹ channel (kir6).1,2 they are

molecular mechanism of anesthetic on  xxxg1253xxx 

materials and methods
molecular biology
the human  xxxg1250xxx , rat  xxxg1255xxx , rat  xxxg19xxx , rat sur2a, and
rat sur2b complementary dnas (cdnas) were kindly
provided by susumu seino, m.d., ph.d. (professor and
chairman, department of cellular and molecular medicine, chiba university, chiba, japan). a truncated form
of human  xxxg1250xxx  lacking the last 36 amino acids at the
c-terminus was obtained by polymerase chain reaction
amplification. polymerase chain reaction products were
cloned into the pcr3.1 vector by using the ta cloning
system (invitrogen corp., carlsbad, ca) and then cloned
into the pcdna3.1 (⫺) vector (invitrogen corp.) for
mammalian expression. site-directed mutagenesis was
performed by using the site-directed mutagenesis system (invitrogen corp.). all  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 dna products
were sequenced by using the bigdye terminator cycle
sequencing kit and an abi prism 377 dna sequencer
(applied biosystems, foster city, ca) to confirm the
sequence.
cell culture and transfection
cos-7 cells were plated at a density of 3 ⫻ 105/dish
(35 mm in diameter) and cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum. a full-length kir cdna and a full-length sur
cdna were subcloned into the mammalian expression
vector pcmv6c. for electrophysiologic recordings, either wild-type or mutated pcmv6c kir alone (1 ␮g), or
pcmv6c kir (1 ␮g) plus pcmv6c sur (1 ␮g) were
transfected into cos-7 cells with green fluorescent protein cdna as a reporter gene by using lipofectamine and
opti-men 1 reagents (life technologies inc., rockville,
md) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. after
transfection, cells were cultured for 48 –72 h before
being subjected to electrophysiologic recordings.
superfusion system
 xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd1868xxx , or pinacidil was diluted in
superfusate and directly applied to cultured cells in the
glass-bottom plastic cell bath (2-ml volume) at a rate of
2–2.5 ml/min using a plastic syringe (50-ml volume),
vinyl chloride tubing (0.8-mm id, 50-cm length), and a
syringe pump (terumo stc-525, tokyo, japan). when
the dose-dependent effects of propofol or  xxxd3348xxx 
were studied, the superfusion was stopped for approximately 1 min at each concentration, and these drugs
were injected into the cell bath using a glass syringe to
five final concentrations in a cumulative manner (total
volume injected was approximately 20 ␮l). therefore,
the superfusion was stopped for approximately 5 min;
preliminary studies showed that the stopping of superfusion for approximately 5 min had no significant effects
on electrophysiologic measurements. the average percent recovery of  xxxg1253xxx  activities after washout of

before drug treatment.
electrophysiologic measurements
membrane currents were recorded in the inside-out
configurations using a patch clamp amplifier as described previously.24,25 transfected cells were identified
by their green fluorescence under a microscope. the
intracellular solution contained 140 mm kcl, 2 mm egta,
2 mm mgcl2, and 10 mm hepes (ph ⫽ 7.3). the pipette
solution contained 140 mm kcl, 1 mm cacl2, 1 mm
mgcl2, and 10 mm hepes (ph ⫽ 7.4). recordings were
made at 36° ⫾ 0.5°c. patch pipettes were pulled with an
electrode puller (pp-830; narishige, tokyo, japan) and
coated with sylgard (dow corning, midland, mi). the
resistance of pipettes filled with internal solution and
immersed in the tyrode’s solution was 3– 4 m⍀. the
sampling frequency of the single-channel data was 5 khz
with a low-pass filter (1 khz).
electrophysiologic data analysis
channel currents were recorded with a patch clamp
amplifier (cez 2200; nihon kohden, tokyo, japan) and
stored in a personal computer (aptiva; international
business machine corporation, armonk, ny) with an
analog-to-digital converter (digidata 1200; axon instruments, foster, ca). pclamp version 7 software (axon
instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis.
the open probability (po) was determined from current
amplitude histograms and was calculated as follows:

td 䡠 n

where tj is the time spent at current levels corresponding
to j ⫽ 0, 1, 2, n channels in the open state; td is the
duration of the recording; and n is the number of the
channels active in the patch. recordings of 2–3 min
were analyzed to determine po. the channel activity was
expressed as npo. changes of channel activity in the
presence of drugs were calculated as the relative channel activity between the values obtained before and after
drug treatment.
when the inside-out patches in the atp-free bath solution are formed, recombinant  xxxg1253xxx  activity
gradually decreases with time. this phenomenon is
known as run-down. consequently, data obtained from
such experiments with inside-out patches may not accurately represent the relation between a drug and katp
channel activity. to minimize this time-dependent decrease of the channel activity, we determined the effect
of a single concentration of propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  from
each inside-out patch within 3 min of patch excision.
under these conditions, the average percent recovery of

where y is the relative npo, [d] is the concentration of

drugs
the following drugs were used: propofol (2, xxxd3030xxx ; aldrich chemical co., milwaukee, wi),  xxxd3348xxx  sodium (yoshitomi chemical, st. louis, mo),  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd1868xxx , and pinacidil (sigma-aldrich
japan, tokyo, japan). propofol,  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd1868xxx , and pinacidil were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx 
(the final concentration of solvent was 0.01%), which at
a twofold higher concentration did not affect  xxxg1253xxx  currents. the  xxxd3348xxx  sodium ampule was opened
just before use.
statistics
all data are presented as mean ⫾ sd. differences
between data sets were evaluated either by repeatedmeasure one-way analysis of variance followed by
scheffé f test or by student t test. p ⬍ 0.05 was considered significant.

results
single-channel characteristics of four different
types of recombinant  xxxg1253xxx  currents
four types of reconstituted recombinant katp channels were transiently expressed in cos-7 cells, inside-out
patches were excised, and the  xxxg1253xxx  currents
were recorded. figure 1a shows representative examples of these currents. we did not observe channel
openings in the cell-attached configuration in any case.
however, when the patch was excised into a nucleotidefree solution, the katp channels composed of  xxxg1250xxx  in
combination with  xxxg19xxx , sur2a, or sur2b showed
marked current increases. these currents were blocked
by 1 mm atp, which shows that cos-7 cells cotransfected with wild-type  xxxg1250xxx  and sur express functional
atp-sensitive k⫹ channels. the sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx  channel
was not spontaneously activated by patch excision in the
absence of intracellular atp.  xxxd1868xxx  (300 ␮m), a potent opener of katp channels, activated the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx ,
sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx , and sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx  channels with high potency but activated sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  channels with only
lower potency. in all cases, the currents were comanesthesiology, v 100, no 2, feb 2004

experimental models to characterize the function of the
native katp channels in greater detail.
effect of anesthetics on recombinant katp
channels
to assess the effects of propofol or  xxxd3348xxx  on recombinant katp channels, we measured single-channel
currents on inside-out patch configurations in the presence of these drugs. the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx , sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx ,
and sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx  channel currents were inhibited by
application of 100 ␮m propofol to the intracellular membrane surface, with relative channel activities decreasing
to 0.40 ⫾ 0.11, 0.39 ⫾ 0.07, and 0.37 ⫾ 0.09 of control,
respectively (fig. 2a). however, propofol did not significantly inhibit the sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx  channel currents.  xxxd3348xxx  at 300 ␮m blocked the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx , sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx ,
sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx , and sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx  channel currents, with

summarized in table 1. propofol inhibited the  xxxg19xxx /
 xxxg1250xxx , sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx , and sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx  channel activities with equivalent potencies, whereas even high concentrations of propofol had no significant inhibitory
effects on the sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx  channels.  xxxd3348xxx  inhibits
the sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx , sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx , and sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx 
channel activities with high affinity, but inhibits the
 xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channel activities with lower potency. in all
cases, the blockades by  xxxd3348xxx  and propofol did not
significantly change the conductance of the katp channels, and the hill coefficients were close to unity, which
indicates that only a single propofol or  xxxd3348xxx  molecule has to interact with the channel to inhibit it. table
1 also indicates that the inhibitory effects of propofol
and  xxxd3348xxx  for the sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  channels are similar
to those previously reported for the native rat cardiac
katp channels.24,25
single-channel characteristics of  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36
currents
it has been previously reported that although wild-type
 xxxg1250xxx  alone does not show functional channel activity,
removal of the last 26 or 36 amino acids at the cterminus of  xxxg1250xxx  ( xxxg1250xxx ⌬c26 or  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36) results
in channels that show significant currents in the absence
of sur.7 we confirmed this observation by using a
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 mutant, which showed single-channel currents (fig. 5a). coexpression of  xxxg19xxx  enhanced the
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 currents. the  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 currents were
blocked by atp, which confirms that  xxxg1250xxx  bears an
intrinsic atp-inhibitory site. the current–voltage relation for the  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 currents was the same as those
of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36.
effect of anesthetics on  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 channel
activity
propofol at 100 ␮m and  xxxd3348xxx  at 1,000 ␮m inhibited
the  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 currents, with relative channel activities
decreasing to 0.35 ⫾ 0.12 ms, and 0.27 ⫾ 0.09 of
control, respectively (fig. 5b). the dose-dependent effects of  xxxd3348xxx  and propofol on  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 currents
anesthesiology, v 100, no 2, feb 2004

are shown in figure 5c. the half-maximal blocks (ec50)
of propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  are summarized in table 1.
these observations suggest that both propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  target the  xxxg1250xxx  subunit. sur does not enhance
the propofol sensitivity of  xxxg1250xxx , but the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd3348xxx  was enhanced by coexpression with
sur, especially coexpression with the  xxxg20xxx  subunit.
the hill coefficients of propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  for
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 did not change in comparison with the
other reconstituted katp channels (table 1).
effect of anesthetics on mutations in  xxxg1250xxx 
molecules
we next identified the regions of  xxxg1250xxx  that play
critical roles in the inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 channel
activity mediated by propofol or  xxxd3348xxx  using systematically mutating  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36. the effects of propofol
(100 ␮m),  xxxd3348xxx  (1,000 ␮m) or atp (1 mm), which all
inhibit wild-type  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 currents by less than 50%,
were tested on each mutant (fig. 6).
it has been previously reported that the mutations that
affect atp sensitivity are located in two distinct  xxxg1250xxx 
lesions, namely, the r50d lesion in the n-terminus and a
lesion in the c-terminus that includes c166s, t171a,
k185q, and g334d.26,27 we confirmed these observations (fig. 6). interestingly, propofol sensitivity was also
decreased by the c166s, t171a, and k185q mutations.
we identified another mutation, r31e, that also suppressed the ability of propofol to inhibit  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36
currents (p ⬍ 0.001 vs. wild-type  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36). several
mutations, including c166s and t171a, also caused
smaller but nonsignificant shifts in the ability of 1,000 ␮m
 xxxd3348xxx  to inhibit  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 currents (fig. 6).
analysis of single-channel currents
recent mutagenesis studies have suggested that c166
or  xxxd1728xxx  in  xxxg1250xxx  plays a role in the intrinsic gating of the
channel, possibly by influencing a gate located at the
intracellular end of the pore.26 –28 we found that  xxxd3348xxx  but not propofol increases the long closed time and

discussion
we have demonstrated here by using katp channels
reconstituted in cos-7 cells that the intravenous anesthetics propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  specifically inhibit particular katp channels. propofol inhibits  xxxg1250xxx -containing
channels combined with any of the three sur molecules
tested ( xxxg19xxx , sur2a, and sur2b) but has no effect on
sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx  channels, whereas  xxxd3348xxx  strongly
blocks sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx , sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx , and sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx 
channels but has a weaker effect on  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels. these observations suggest that propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  could have tissue-specific inhibitory actions in
vivo. these observations are also consistent with our
previous findings that both propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  inhibit the native rat cardiac  xxxg1253xxx  (sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx )
in patch clamp configuration.24,25
that propofol selectively blocks  xxxg1250xxx -containing
channels and also inhibits  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 currents in the
concentration range tested supports the notion that
 xxxg1250xxx  may be the primary target of propofol (table 1). in
addition, that propofol does not significantly inhibit
anesthesiology, v 100, no 2, feb 2004

sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx  channels suggests that the  xxxg1255xxx  does not
bear the propofol inhibitory site found on  xxxg1250xxx . this
makes propofol the first drug reported to selectively
block  xxxg1250xxx  but not  xxxg1255xxx .
the isoforms of  xxxg1250xxx  that lack the c-terminal 26 or 36
amino acids retain their sensitivity to atp as an intrinsic
property.7 in the study reported here, we demonstrated
that the k185q mutation in  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 eliminates the
abilities of both atp and propofol to inhibit channel
activity without noticeably affecting the single-channel
kinetics (fig. 6). this indicates that the site by which
propofol mediates  xxxg1253xxx  inhibition is at least
partly identical to that involved in the atp block. recent
studies have also suggested that apart from the c-terminal k185 residue, the distal part of the c-terminal region
(amino acids 333–338) and the n-terminal r50 residue
participate in atp sensitivity.26,28 although mutations of
these regions (r50g, g334d) did not abrogate propofolmediated channel inhibition, we did identify another
mutation in the n-terminus, namely, r31e, which significantly reduces the inhibitory effects of propofol (fig. 6).
these results indicate that both the n- and c-termini of
 xxxg1250xxx  participate in the inhibition mediated by propofol
as well as that induced by atp.
in contrast with propofol, we found that  xxxd3348xxx

propofol (100 ␮m), or  xxxd3348xxx  (1,000 ␮m). the relative channel activities were calculated by dividing the channel activity in

atp. amino acids are denoted by the single-letter codes. each

inhibits all four of the recombinant sarcolemmal katp
channels (albeit  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  less potently; fig. 4 and
table 1) as well as native rat cardiac katp channels24 and
the  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 channels. in addition, although sur molecules did not enhance the propofol sensitivity of
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 channels, the  xxxd3348xxx  sensitivity of
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 channels was enhanced by coexpression
with sur, especially  xxxg20xxx , suggesting that  xxxd3348xxx 
likely has tissue-specific effects based on differential sensitivities to  xxxd3348xxx  exhibited by the various types of
the katp channels (table 1, ec50 values). furthermore,
the current study indicates more important findings regarding the molecular mechanisms of  xxxd3348xxx  actions
on various types of the katp channels. one possibility is
that  xxxd3348xxx  may bind to both the sur and kir molecules. another plausible possibility is that  xxxd3348xxx  acts
on the kir subunit, but its action is modulated by the
sur, because the hill coefficients of approximately 1.1–
1.2 suggest that the binding of one  xxxd3348xxx  is sufficient
to result in the inhibition of channel activity. in addition,
the notion that sur modulates  xxxd3348xxx  sensitivity is
also supported from the ec50 value where the
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36, in the absence of sur, is the least sensitive
to  xxxd3348xxx . our data also show that for the sur2b/
 xxxg1250xxx  and sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx  channels, the ec50 values are
similar despite differences in the kir subunit. on the

patches excised from cos-7 cells. the periods of drug treatment
are marked with horizontal bars. cooh and nh2 indicate the cand n-terminus of  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 channel, respectively.

other hand, for the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  and sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  channels, the ec50 values are not similar, likely because of the
different surs. again, this can be accounted for in the
absence of  xxxd3348xxx  binding to sur.
it has been reported that the cytosolic end of the
second transmembrane domain of  xxxg1250xxx  may play an
important role in the gating of the  xxxg1253xxx 
pore.26 –28 in agreement with these reports, we showed
here that mutations in this region, namely  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 –
c166s and –t171a, markedly increase the channel po by
reducing the long close time (table 2). the finding that
the inhibitory effect of propofol is also reduced by these
mutations suggests that these mutations affect the ability
of propofol to block channel activity by changing the
channel gating kinetics rather than by altering the affinity of propofol for its binding site. in contrast,  xxxd3348xxx 
increased the long closed times with all of the
 xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 mutants. in particular,  xxxd3348xxx  converted
the long burst kinetics of  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36-t171a currents to
the long closed kinetics that were typically observed
with the  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36 channels (fig. 7b and percent long
closed time of  xxxg1250xxx ⌬c36-t171a in table 2). it is therefore possible that  xxxd3348xxx  acts as an open channel
blocker of the kir6 channel.
recent investigations have established that  xxxg1253xxx  activation plays an important role in ischemic preconditioning of myocardium and neural tissue, during
skeletal muscle ischemia, and in the regulation of vascu-

lar smooth muscle tone.10 –12 in addition, it has been
shown that these desirable endogenous effects of katp
channel activation can be induced pharmacologically by
 xxxg1253xxx  openers.29,30 these observations suggest
new therapeutic intervention strategies that may specifically benefit patients who are at risk for development of
untoward ischemic events during cardiac, vascular, or
neurologic surgery. in addition, it seems that volatile
anesthetics, including isoflurane,  xxxd1844xxx , and  xxxd3197xxx , can also protect the myocardium against stunning
and infarction by activating katp channels.14 –16 in contrast to the volatile anesthetics, however, we demonstrate here that two representatives intravenous anesthetics, propofol and  xxxd3348xxx , interact with one or both
of the kir6 subunits to block the  xxxg1253xxx  currents
in a concentration-dependent manner. recent functional
studies have provided direct evidence that each  xxxg1255xxx 
and  xxxg1250xxx  play separate physiologic roles.31–34  xxxg1250xxx 
forms the pore region of the katp channels in the heart,
brain, and skeletal muscle and activation of these channels has shown to be important for cell protection.10 –12
in contrast, the  xxxg1255xxx -containing  xxxg1253xxx  is critical
in the regulation of vascular tonus, especially in the
coronary arteries, and it is known that it protects against
vasospasm during and after myocardial ischemia.31
therefore, our results indicate that intravenous anesthesia with propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  may impair the beneficial
effects mediated by  xxxg1253xxx  activation in various
organs. however, it is possible that propofol may not
significantly inhibit channel activity at the concentrations that are generally used in the clinical setting.
plasma concentrations of propofol up to 50 ␮m after
clinical intravenous induction administration have been
reported.35 if protein binding is taken into account, the
clinically relevant concentration of propofol is less than
2 ␮m.25 the concentrations of propofol needed to inhibit
 xxxg1253xxx  activity in vitro are higher than these
postulated free plasma concentrations, which suggests
that propofol at the concentrations used clinically may
not affect  xxxg1253xxx  activity. in the current study, the
differential propofol effects on  xxxg1255xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx  are
evident at concentrations greater than 10 –30 ␮m (fig. 3);
it is unlikely that this differential effect will be encountered in the clinical setting. however, because propofol

is the first drug reported to selectively block  xxxg1250xxx  but
not  xxxg1255xxx , it may be useful in other experimental settings that require modulation of the functions induced
by  xxxg1250xxx .
unlike propofol,  xxxd3348xxx  may well significantly depress  xxxg1253xxx  activity when it is used as an anesthetic. plasma concentrations of  xxxd3348xxx  up to 0.5 mm
after clinical intravenous induction administration have
been reported.36 if protein binding is taken into account,
the clinically relevant concentrations of  xxxd3348xxx  range
from 0.05 to 0.08 mm.24  xxxd3348xxx  inhibits all four recombinant katp channels at these clinical concentrations (fig. 4). therefore, it is likely that when  xxxd3348xxx  is
used as an intravenous anesthetic, it may inhibit the katp
channel activities in the patient. these results may suggest that  xxxd3348xxx  impairs the endogenous organ-protective mechanism mediated by katp channels against intraoperative ischemic or hypoxic injury. however, there
are other well-established mechanisms of organ protection that do not involve  xxxg1253xxx  activities.  xxxd3348xxx  is a likely candidate for neuroprotection and has been
used as such in our country.37
our study has several limitations. first, we combined
cdnas from different species (human and rat) to reconstitute katp channels. sequence differences between
human and rat cdnas may induce possible influences on
the electrophysiologic properties of katp channels.
however, in most previous studies,2,4 katp channels
were reconstituted by the combination of kir and sur
cdnas from different species (rat or mouse), and it has
been confirmed that the electrophysiologic properties of
all kinds of reconstructed katp channels are similar to
those of the native katp channels. in addition, although
we used the same amount of sur cdna and kir cdna
for transfection, the genomic integration of the various
constructs may have been different, and a varying ratio
of sur versus kir may affect electrophysiologic findings.
therefore, it might be better for us to establish the level
of expression as well as the ratio of sur versus kir
subunits by polymerase chain reaction method and
western blot analyses. however, in the current study,
we confirmed that the sensitivity to atp,  xxxd1868xxx , and
 xxxd2215xxx  and the single-channel conductance of all
kinds of reconstituted katp channels were similar to

346

those of native katp channels (fig. 1). therefore, we
expect that the reconstituted katp channels in the current study can be used as experimental models to characterize the function of the native katp channels and
that we can draw conclusions from our experimental
model. second, we studied the effects of propofol and
 xxxd3348xxx  on sarcolemmal katp channels because mitochondrial katp channels have not been cloned. however, in the heart and brain, mitochondrial rather than
sarcolemmal katp channels might play an important role
for the protection of these tissues. in the future, we must
study the molecular mechanisms of these anesthetics on
reconstituted mitochondrial katp channels.
in conclusion, propofol inhibits all channels with
 xxxg1250xxx  but does not inhibit sur2b/ xxxg1255xxx , which is the
vascular smooth muscle channel. in contrast,  xxxd3348xxx 
inhibits all channels with either  xxxg1255xxx  or  xxxg1250xxx . these
results, as well as site-directed mutagenesis studies, suggest that propofol and  xxxd3348xxx  may act via the  xxxg1250xxx 
subunit, albeit by different molecular mechanisms. the
n- and c-termini of  xxxg1250xxx  participate in the inhibition of
 xxxg1253xxx  by propofol. in the case of  xxxd3348xxx , the
sur subunit seems to modulate anesthetic activity on
the kir subunit.
