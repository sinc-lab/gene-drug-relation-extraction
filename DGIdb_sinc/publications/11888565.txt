abstract
we have previously reported that the 5-ht uptake blocker and releaser, dexfenfluramine, attenuates ethanol intake, and that this may be
mediated via a  xxxg1115xxx  mechanism. our goals were to further determine the contribution made by this receptor subtype in mediating
the reduction in ethanol self-administration induced by dexfenfluramine using the selective 5-ht2c antagonist, sb242,084. additionally, we
wanted to compare dexfenfluramine’s effects on ethanol motivated responding with those elicited by the  xxxg1115xxx  agonist ro60-0175.
in male wistar rats trained to self-administer a 12% w/v  xxxd102xxx  on an fr-4 schedule, both dexfenfluramine (0.05 – 2.5 mg/kg ip)
and ro60-0175 (0.1 – 1 mg/kg sc) produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in ethanol self-administration, which was reversed by
sb242,084 (0.5 mg/kg ip). interestingly, sb242,084 alone (0.1 – 1 mg/kg ip) significantly increased ethanol motivated responding in both
high and low ethanol drinking animals. while dexfenfluramine had no effect on ethanol’s kinetic profile, the selective 5-ht2c agents used
had opposing effects, with the agonist ro60-0175 decreasing and the antagonist sb242,084 increasing blood ethanol levels. since there were
incongruent drug effects on ethanol self-administration and blood ethanol levels, these data support a role for 5-ht2c receptors in modifying
ethanol intake independent of their effects on blood ethanol kinetics. furthermore, 5-ht2c receptors may exert a tonic control over ethanol
self-administration behaviour, since agonist and antagonist administration had opposing effects on this behaviour. d 2002 elsevier science

1. introduction
an important role played by central serotonergic systems
in modulating many of the behavioural effects of ethanol,
including its self-administration, has been recognized for
sometime (sellers et al., 1992; mcbride et al., 1993).
studies have demonstrated that manipulations that enhance
central 5-ht function attenuate voluntary ethanol intake
across species, although there are some inconsistencies in
the literature (lemarquand et al., 1994a,b). the reasons for
these inconsistencies may reflect the complexity of the
serotonergic system, with at least 14 mammalian 5-ht

receptor subtypes identified to date (boess and martin,
1994). therefore, there has been an increasing focus to
ascertain the functional role of these different 5-ht receptor
subtypes in modifying the behavioural and physiological
effects of ethanol (romach and tomkins, 1995). previously,
we have shown that the ability of the 5-ht releaser,
dexfenfluramine, to suppress ethanol intake may be mediated via 5-ht2 receptors, possibly the  xxxg1115xxx 
subtype (higgins et al., 1992). due to a paucity of selective
 xxxg1113xxx  agents available at that time, however, this
could not be shown definitively. with the recent development of more selective pharmacological probes for the
 xxxg1115xxx  subtype (martin et al., 1998; kennett et al.,
1997), the relative contribution played by this receptor in the
regulation of ethanol intake may be examined more fully.
in addition to the original data described above, there are a
number of compelling reasons for undertaking further re-

search to explore the role of the  xxxg1115xxx  subtype in
regulating ethanol intake. firstly, autoradiographical and
immunohistochemical studies have reported notable levels
of 5-ht2c mrna and protein in various brain regions
implicated in reward related behaviours, including regions
of the amygdala, cortex, nucleus accumbens shell and ventral
tegmental area (pompeiano et al., 1994; abramowski et al.,
1995; eberle-wang et al., 1997; clement et al., 2000).
furthermore, 5-ht2c receptors have been reported to exert
a modulatory influence over dopamine neurotransmission,
possibly via an alteration in gabaergic function (prisco
et al., 1994; di matteo et al., 1998; di matteo et al., 1999;
di giovanni et al., 2001; lucas and spampinato, 2000). this
is noteworthy for the present investigation given that dopamine is one of the major neurotransmitter systems linked to
reinforcement processes (koob, 2000; koob and bloom,
1988; robinson and berridge, 2000). thus, peripheral administration of the 5-ht2c agonist, ro60-0175 decreases,
while the 5-ht2c antagonist, sb242,084 increases extracellular dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens and frontal
cortex (millan et al., 1998; di matteo et al., 1999). activation
of 5-ht2c receptors within the vta has also been shown to
inhibit dopamine cell firing, while the selective 5-ht2c
antagonist has the opposite effect (millan et al., 1998; di
matteo et al., 1999). taken together, these data suggest that
the  xxxg1115xxx  exerts an important modulatory influence over mesolimbic dopamine function and therefore may
have an important impact on ethanol motivated behaviour.
while selective agents for the  xxxg1115xxx  only
recently became available, drugs with mixed agonist activity
at 5-ht receptor subtypes further support a role for the
 xxxg1115xxx  in regulating ethanol intake. thus, mixed
5-ht1b/2c agonists, such as mcpp and tfmpp, have consistently been reported to suppress ethanol self-administration, both in two bottle choice and operant test procedures,
although their behavioural selectivity for modifying ethanol
intake is a matter of controversy (higgins et al., 1992;
buczek et al., 1994; wilson et al., 1998; maurel et al.,
1999a,b). furthermore, in the case of mcpp, there are
conflicting results from antagonist interaction studies
regarding the relative involvement of the  xxxg1115xxx 
in mediating these effects (buczek et al., 1994; maurel et al.,
1998, 1999a,b). interestingly, there is some evidence to
suggest that mcpp’s ability to generalize to an ethanol cue
in rats trained to discriminate modest ethanol doses can be
blocked by the selective 5-ht2c/2b antagonist, sb206,553
(kennett et al., 1996), suggesting that some of ethanol’s
effects are mediated via this receptor subtype (maurel et al.,
1998). another 5-ht agonist that has been widely investigated is doi, which has similar affinities for the 5-ht2a
and  xxxg1115xxx  subtypes (middlemiss and tricklebank, 1992). studies to date suggest that this agent selectively suppresses ethanol intake and motivated responding
(mcbride et al., 1990; wilson et al., 1998; maurel et al.,
1999a,b), and while antagonist studies suggest that this may
be mediated via its interaction with the  xxxg1113xxx 

(maurel et al., 1999a,b), an additional role played by the
 xxxg1115xxx  has yet to been ruled out. in addition to the
data suggesting that the ability of the 5-ht releaser, dexfenfluramine, to suppress ethanol intake is mediated via the
 xxxg1115xxx  (higgins et al., 1992), these observations
support the need for further research in this area.
the aim of this series of studies was to further clarify the
potential involvement of 5-ht2c receptors in regulating
ethanol intake. in the first set of experiments, we compared
the behavioural profile elicited by acute administration of
dexfenfluramine on ethanol self-administration behavior by
male wistar rats with that seen following the administration
of the  xxxg1115xxx  agonist, ro60-0175 under identical
experimental conditions. ro60-0175, an n-methy-ethylamine-indole, is often described as a selective  xxxg1115xxx  agonist, since many of its effects in vivo are reported to be
mediated by this receptor subtype (millan et al., 1997;
martin et al., 1998; dekeyne et al., 1999), however, it also
exhibits almost equivalent affinity and efficacy at the closely
related 5-ht2a and  xxxg1114xxx  subtypes (martin et al.,
1998; porter et al., 1999). therefore, to clearly demonstrate
the involvement of 5-ht2c receptors in mediating the
suppressant effects of both dexfenfluramine and ro600175 on ethanol motivated responding, it was important
to demonstrate that their effects could be reversed by a selective 5-ht2c antagonist. in the second series of experiments,
the effect of the selective  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist,
sb242,085, administered alone, and in combination with
dexfenfluramine and ro60-0175, on ethanol self-administration was examined. the selection of sb242,084 for these
studies was based on its high affinity (pki 9.0) and 100-fold
selectivity for the  xxxg1115xxx  subtype, in addition to its
ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier (kennett et al.,
1997). a previous study reported that fenfluramine did not
alter ethanol metabolism in fawn-hooded rats, and therefore
its ability to suppress ethanol intake was due to enhancement
of serotonergic activity and not alteration in ethanol kinetics
(rezvani and grady, 1994). thus, a final study was included
to assess the effect of dexfenfluramine, and the newer agents,
ro60-0175 and sb242,084, alone and in combination, on
blood ethanol levels.

2. methods
2.1. animals and housing
male wistar rats (charles river, canada), weighing
approximately 250 g at the start of the studies, were
individually housed in hanging wire mesh cages with food
and water available ad libitum except where stated otherwise. they were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle in an
environmentally controlled room (lights on at 19:00 h,
temperature: 22 –24 c, humidity: 30– 60%) and allowed
a 1-week acclimatization period to the animal facilities prior
to the start of any of the procedures.

2.2. operant ethanol self-administration procedure
training the animals to operantly respond for ethanol
consisted of three elements. initially, the animals had 24-h
home cage access to both an  xxxd102xxx  and water for a
3-week period. the concentration of the  xxxd102xxx 
presented was increased each week from 3% to 6% and
finally to a 12% w/v  xxxd102xxx . on the third day of
home cage access to the 6% w/v  xxxd102xxx  food
training was initiated. during this time, the rats continued to
have free access to water and ethanol, except for the time
spent in the operant chambers, but their daily food intake
was restricted to 20 g. food training was conducted in eight
operant chambers measuring 28 cm long, 21 cm wide and
21 cm high (med. associates, georgia, vt). each chamber
contained a food pellet dispenser able to deliver 45 mg
noyes food pellets into a recessed dish positioned 3 cm
above floor level and two response levers (4.5 cm wide and
7 cm above the chamber floor), the centres of which were
located 6.5 cm either side of the dish. each chamber was
housed in a sound-attenuating box equipped with a ventilation fan and illuminated by a house light. the apparatus was
controlled by a microcomputer interface (med. associates,
vt) linked to a 386sx ibm computer. initially, each response on the active lever resulted in a delivery of a food
pellet (fixed ratio, fr-1), while responses on the inactive
lever were recorded but had no consequences. the sessions
lasted 15 min or until the rat had earned 50 reinforcers. the
reinforcement schedule was increased to fr-5 and eventually fr-10 when the rat earned 50 reinforcers on 2 consecutive days. the rats received a total of 8 days of food
operant training. the ad libitum food regimen was then
recommenced and home cage ethanol access was stopped.
two days following the last food training session, operant
responding for a 12% w/v  xxxd102xxx  was initiated.
ethanol self-administration sessions were performed in
16 operant chambers similar in construction to those used
for the food training except that each chamber contained a
solenoid operated liquid dispenser calibrated to deliver
0.1 ml of fluid into a recessed dish positioned 3 cm above
floor level. the rats were placed daily in the operant boxes
for 30 min and trained to press the active lever for a 12%
(w/v)  xxxd102xxx  on a fr-1 schedule. the response
requirement was switched to fr-2 and finally to fr-4 when
reliable responding at each schedule was achieved. responding on the inactive lever was recorded but had no
programmed consequences. when stable responding had
been established, the drug studies were started.
2.3. study 1: effect of acute dexfenfluramine and
ro60-0175 administration on oral ethanol
self-administration
male wistar rats (n = 8) were initially trained to consume
ethanol as outlined above. when the response pattern had
stabilized, the effect of the acute administration of dexfen-

737

fluramine (0, 0.5, 1 and 2.5 mg/kg ip, 60 min pretreatment)
on self-administration behaviour was evaluated. a latin
square design was employed such that each animal received
each dose in a balanced order. each treatment day was
separated from the next by at least 3 days. following the
data analysis of this study, a second experiment was conducted to determine the effects of lower dexfenfluramine
doses (0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg ip) on ethanol motivated
responding. this was assessed in 11 previously drug naı̈ve
rats. in a third group of male wistar rats (n = 10), the effect
of the acute administration of ro60-0175 (0, 0.1, 0.3 and
1 mg/kg sc, 30 min pretreatment) on self-administration
behaviour was evaluated in a similar manner.
2.4. study 2: effect of selective  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist,
sb242,084 on dexfenfluramine- and ru24969-induced
suppression of oral ethanol self-administration
this study was designed to determine if the effects
observed in study 1 were due to  xxxg1115xxx  activation.
thus, the ability of the selective 5-ht2c antagonist,
sb242,084, to reverse the effects of dexfenfluramine and
ro60-0175 on oral ethanol self-administration was examined. two separate groups of experimentally naı̈ve rats were
trained to self-administer ethanol. in the first group, the
ability of sb242,084 (0.5 mg/kg ip, n = 6), to reverse the
effects of 0.5 mg/kg dexfenfluramine on ethanol self-administration was assessed. a latin square design was
employed, with sb242,084 administered 20 min prior to
dexfenfluramine, such that each animal received each drug
combination in a balanced order. each treatment day
was separated from the next by at least 3 days. in a second
group of animals (n = 8), the ability of the sb242,084
(0.5 mg/kg ip) administered 20 min prior to ro60-0175
(0.5 mg/kg sc) was assessed in a similar manner. analysis of
the data from these studies suggested that sb242,084
increased ethanol self-administration behaviour. to examine
this further, an additional group of rats (n = 4) that did not
acquire pharmacologically relevant levels of ethanol selfadministration (< 0.3 g/kg) were employed to determine
whether sb242,084 dose dependently increases ethanol
self-administration (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg ip, 40 min
pretreatment) in low ethanol drinking rats.
2.5. study 3: effect of dexfenfluramine, ro60-0175
and sb242,084 on the pharmacokinetic profile of
experimenter-administered ethanol in male wistar rats
rats were fasted overnight prior to the study. each rat
received its allocated treatment and when the relevant
pretreatment time had elapsed the rats received a 0.8 g/kg
bolus dose of ethanol (10% w/v) by gavage. blood samples
(50 ml) were taken from the tip of the tail of each rat at 15,
30, 45 and 60 min post-ethanol administration. blood
ethanol levels were determined by gas – liquid chromatography technique (leblanc, 1968) with  xxxd2400xxx  as

internal standard. the effect of dexfenfluramine on ethanol
blood levels was examined in 10 drug naı̈ve male wistar
rats. the rats were divided into two groups, one group
received 0.5 mg/kg dexfenfluramine 60 min prior to the
ethanol administration, the remaining animals were administered saline (1 ml/kg). one week later, the study was
repeated, with the animals receiving the second treatment. in
a similar manner, the effects of 0.5 mg/kg ro60-0175
administered as a 30-min pretreatment was examined in a
separate group of 10 drug naı̈ve rats. in a group of 32 rats,
the influence of the combined administration of the selective
5-ht2c antagonist, sb242,084 (0.5 mg/kg), and either
dexfenfluramine (0.5 mg/kg), ro60-0175 (0.5 mg/kg) or
saline (1 ml/kg) on blood ethanol levels achieved following
oral administration of 0.8 g/kg ethanol was examined.

decrease in ethanol self-administration was due, in part, to
an earlier termination in ethanol motivated responding
[ f(3,21) = 12.37, p = .001] and a modest increase in the
latency to earn the first reinforcer (fig. 1). there was no
significant effect of dexfenfluramine on response rate in
those animals that did respond for ethanol [ f(2,10) = 1.33,
n.s., table 1], or responding on the inactive lever
[ f(3,21) = 2.08, n.s., data not shown]. in the second study
to determine the lowest effective dose of dexfenfluramine
to attenuate ethanol self-administration, there was a significant overall treatment effect on ethanol intake [ f(3,30) =
7.1, p = .001], number of ethanol reinforcers earned
[ f(3,30) = 7.20, p < .001] and latency to earn the first
ethanol reinforcer [ f(3,30) = 4.57, p < .01], while the total

data were analysed by one or two way repeated measures anova using statsview software. post hoc comparisons were carried out with neuman– keuls test. in all cases,

3. results
3.1. study 1: effect of acute dexfenfluramine and
ro60-0175 administration on oral ethanol
self-administration
in the initial dexfenfluramine study, the rats selected for
the study exhibited stable and selective responding on the
ethanol appropriate lever (total presses on the active lever:
162.1 ± 29.9; total presses on the inactive lever; 0.8 ± 0.3), to
self-administer pharmacologically relevant levels of ethanol
(0.76 ± 0.14 g/kg). acute dexfenfluramine administration
(0.5 – 2.5 mg/kg) significantly and dose dependently
reduced the total number of ethanol reinforcers obtained
[ f(3,21) = 20.47, p < .001] during the 30-min test session
(fig. 1). post hoc analysis showed that all doses of
dexfenfluramine reduced ethanol motivated responding
[ f(3,21) = 18.8, p < .001], with none of the animals
responding for ethanol at the 2.5 mg/kg dose level. this

groups of animals, dexfenfluramine (0,0.5, 1 and 2.5 mg/kg ip, n = 8 and 0,
0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg ip, n = 10) was administered such that each rat
received all treatments in a randomised manner 60 min prior to the initiation
of the test session. significant differences from the vehicle control condition

0.5 mg/kg dose of dexfenfluramine significantly reduced
ethanol motivated responding (fig. 1). under control conditions, responding on the inactive lever during the operant
session was low (1.1 ± 0.5) and this was not altered by
dexfenfluramine administration [ f(3,30) = 0.34, n.s., data
not shown].
rats selected for the acute ro60-0175 challenge study
exhibited stable and selective responding on the ethanol
appropriate lever (total presses on the active lever: 129.4 ±
20.4; total presses on the inactive lever; 0.7 ± 0.4), to selfadminister pharmacologically relevant levels of ethanol
(0.62 ± 0.11 g/kg). acute ro60-0175 administration produced similar effects on ethanol self-administration as that
observed following dexfenfluramine administration (fig. 2).
ro60-0175 (0.1 –1 mg/kg sc) significantly altered ethanol
intake [ f(3,27) = 18.07, p = .001], number of ethanol reinforcers earned [ f(3,27) = 18.42, p = .001] and total time
spent responding for ethanol [ f(3,27) = 6.50, p = .0019].
post hoc analysis showed that both the 0.3 and 1 mg/kg
doses reduced ethanol motivated responding, with three of
the animals failing to respond for ethanol at the 1 mg/kg
dose level. there was no effect of ro60-0175 on response
rate in those animals that did respond for ethanol [ f(3,24) =

antagonist, sb242,084 on dexfenfluramine- and
ro60-0175-induced suppression of oral ethanol
self-administration
pretreatment with the selective 5-ht2c antagonist,
sb242,084, reversed dexfenfluramine’s effects on ethanol
self-administration behaviour (fig. 3). statistical analysis
confirmed that dexfenfluramine reduced ethanol intake
[ f(1,5) = 7.06, p = .045] and the number of ethanol reinforcers earned [ f(1,5) = 6.85, p = .047], but did not alter
responding on the inactive lever [ f(1,5) = 1.18, n.s.]. there
was an overall effect of sb242,084 in this study on
measures of ethanol intake [ f(1,5) = 18.7, p = .0075], number of ethanol reinforcers earned [ f(1,5) = 17.7, p = .0085]
and response rate [ f(1,5) = 20.4, p = .0063]. post hoc tests
revealed that the dexfenfluramine-induced suppression of
ethanol self-administration was reversed by sb242,084
(fig. 3), however, sb242,084 pretreatment alone significantly enhanced ethanol self-administration and the rate of
responding on the active, but not the inactive lever.
in a similar manner, sb242,084 reversed the effects of
ro60-0175 on ethanol self-administration (fig. 4). stat-

istical analysis confirmed that ro60-0175 reduced ethanol
intake [ f(1,7) = 5.79, p = .047] and that sb242,084 had
an overall significant effect on ethanol intake [ f(1,7) =
39.3, p = .0004], number of ethanol reinforcers earned
[ f(1,7) = 39.32, p = .0004] and response rate [ f(1,7) =
10.7, p = .014], but did not alter responding on the inactive lever [ f(1,7) = 2.74, n.s.]. post hoc analyses showed
that sb242,084 reversed the effects of ro60-0175, however, sb242,084 pretreatment alone significantly enhanced
ethanol self-administration and the rate of responding on
the active, but not the inactive lever, as observed in the
above study.
in the final study examining the effects of sb242,084
pretreatment on ethanol self-administration behaviour in low
ethanol consuming animals, statistical analyses revealed a
significant potentiation in ethanol intake that was dose
dependent [ f(3,9) = 4.02, p = .045] (fig. 5). post hoc tests
showed that both the 0.5 and 1 mg/kg doses tested accounted
for this overall significance. in contrast to the effects seen
in high ethanol drinking rats, there was no significant
effect of sb242,084 on response rates [ f(3,9) = 0.52,

3.3. study 3: effect of dexfenfluramine, ro60-0175
and sb242,084 on the pharmacokinetic profile of
experimenter-administered ethanol in male wistar rats
statistical analysis of the effects of dexfenfluramine and
ro60-0175 on blood ethanol levels revealed a difference
between these two agents. while dexfenfluramine had no
effect on ethanol’s kinetic profile [ f(1,27) = 0.8, n.s.],
ro60-0175 significantly attenuated blood ethanol levels
achieved over the 1-h sampling period [ f(1,27) = 53.8,
p = 0.0001] (table 2). in the second study, examining the
effects of the selective 5-ht2c antagonist, sb242,084 on
blood ethanol levels, when administered alone, or in combination with dexfenfluramine or ro60-0175, statistical
analysis revealed a significant effect of drug condition on
blood ethanol levels [ f(3,73) = 5.5, p =.004]. post hoc tests
revealed that sb242,084 reversed the effects of ro60-0175,
however, when administered alone, or in combination with
dexfenfluramine, sb242,084 significantly increased blood
ethanol levels (table 2).

4. discussion
the present results suggest that 5-ht2c receptors exert a
tonic influence over ethanol self-administration behaviour
by male wistar rats. this is supported by the observations
that peripheral administration of the 5-ht releaser, dexfenfluramine, and the 5-ht2c agonist, ro60-0175, suppressed
ethanol self-administration and that this suppression induced
by both of these drugs was reversed by the administration of
the selective 5-ht2c antagonist, sb242,984. in addition,
sb242,084 administration alone enhanced ethanol selfadministration in both high and low ethanol self-administering animals. these findings are consistent with our previous
data that implicated the  xxxg1113xxx , possibly the 5-ht2c
receptor subtype, in mediating the effects of dexfenflur-

amine (higgins et al., 1992). in addition, other serotonergic
agents with intrinsic activity at the  xxxg1115xxx  subtype
(e.g., mcpp, tfmpp, doi) have been reported to suppress
ethanol intake at doses that do not alter lever press response
rates or locomotor activity (mcbride et al., 1990; higgins
et al., 1992; buczek et al., 1994; wilson et al., 1998; maurel
et al., 1999a,b). furthermore, dexfenfluramine and ro600175 altered the profile of ethanol motivated responding in a
similar manner, suggesting that their effects are elicited by a
common mechanism, that was typified by an early termination in responding at doses that did not alter response rate.
ro60-0175, is often described as a selective 5-ht2c
receptor agonist, however, it also exhibits almost equivalent
affinity and efficacy at the closely related 5-ht2a and
 xxxg1114xxx  subtypes (martin et al., 1998; porter et al.,
1999), which may have contributed to the present findings.
this is supported by autoradiographic mapping studies that
have suggested that lower densities of 5-ht2a binding sites
in discrete brain regions are correlated with an increased
propensity to consume ethanol (mcbride et al., 1993; ciccocioppo et al., 1997, 1999; but see korpi et al., 1992).
furthermore, pharmacological studies conducted by maurel
et al. (1999a,b) have proposed a selective role played by the
 xxxg1113xxx  in regulating ethanol intake. however, we
have demonstrated that the effects of ro60-0175 on ethanol
self-administration were reversed by sb242,084, an antagonist that has been reported to exhibit 100- and 158-fold
selectivity for the  xxxg1115xxx  over the 5-ht2a and
 xxxg1114xxx  subtypes respectively (kennett et al., 1997).
these data suggest that the effects of ro60-0175 on ethanol
intake are mediated via activation of the  xxxg1115xxx 
which is in concordance with findings from other behavioural studies using this agonist (millan et al., 1997; martin
et al., 1998; dekeyne et al., 1999) and with our previous data
with dexfenfluramine (higgins et al., 1992).
previously, it has been reported that dexfenfluramine
does not alter locomotor behaviour at doses relevant to the
present study (wilson et al., 1998), while doses of ro600175 that suppress ethanol intake do not induce catalepsy or
modify performance in tests of motor co-ordination (grottick et al., 2000). therefore, it is unlikely that a general

742

d.m. tomkins et al. / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 71 (2002) 735–744

disruption of motor behaviour could account for the suppression in ethanol self-administration produced by either of
these agents. administration of sb242,084 alone, enhanced
ethanol motivated responding, an effect that is also unlikely
to be due to nonspecific changes in motor behaviour. this is
supported by the reports that sb242,0984, at similar or
higher doses than those used in the present study, did not
significantly increase locomotor activity behaviour (kennett
et al., 1997; hutson et al., 2000; higgins et al., 2001). in the
case of dexfenfluramine, we have also ruled out a possible
influence of altered ethanol pharmacokinetics in underlying
its ability to reduce ethanol intake, which is consistent
with previous findings in fawn-hooded rats (rezvani
and grady, 1994). in contrast, the 5-ht 2c agonist,
ro60-0175 decreased, while the selective 5-ht2c antagonist, sb242,084 increased blood ethanol levels under similar
experimental conditions. since we observed bidirectional
effects with more selective 5-ht2c agonist and antagonist
treatments, there is a possibility that this is a 5-ht2c
mediated effect. although, there has been no direct evidence
that 5-ht2c receptors occur in peripheral tissue (hoyer et al.,
1994), a recent study by javid and naylor (1999) suggests
that gastrointestinal motility may be under the influence of
5-ht2c receptors, which in turn may alter ethanol absorption. alternatively, drug-induced alterations in peripheral
blood flow may have contributed to these findings since the
blood samples used in the analyses were drawn from the
tail. there is clear evidence that 5-ht administration causes
vasoconstriction of the rat tail artery, and that is susceptible
to reversal by preferential 5-ht2a antagonists (kaumann
and frenken, 1988; pertz and elz, 1995). there is, however,
currently no evidence to suggest a 5-ht2c or 5-ht2b
receptor mediated effect on blood flow in the rat tail. further
assessment of other selective agents at this receptor subtype,
as well as the demonstration of their distribution in peripheral tissue, and/or their effects on peripheral blood flow
are necessary to confirm a 5-ht2c mediated effect on
ethanol pharmacokinetics and elucidate the mechanism
underlying this effect.
these blood ethanol data raise the possibility that the
alterations in ethanol self-administration behaviour are secondary to the influence of both ro60-0175 and sb242,084
on ethanol pharmacokinetics. experimental evidence to
date, however, has not demonstrated a clear relationship
between alterations in ethanol pharmacokinetics and ethanol
drinking behaviour. thus, pharmacological manipulations
that reduce blood ethanol levels, have been reported to
decrease (buczek et al., 1998), increase (linseman, 1989)
or have no effect (linseman, 1989) on ethanol self-administration behaviour. pharmacological manipulations that
increase blood ethanol levels have also produced conflicting
effects on ethanol self-administration, with both increases
and decreases in ethanol intake being reported (waller et al.,
1982; boyle et al., 1998; williams et al., 1998; gentry et al.,
1983; gentry, 1985; aragon et al., 1993). in light of these
conflicting data, which may be a result of the differing

experimental conditions employed, it is difficult to predict
the contribution made by alterations in ethanol pharmacokinetics on ethanol intake in the present study. evidence
suggests, however, that  xxxg1115xxx -mediated changes
in ethanol self-administration cannot solely be accounted for
by altered ethanol pharmacokinetics. thus, while dexfenfluramine and ro60-0175 elicit similar changes in ethanol
motivated responding, namely an early termination in
responding, both of which are reversed by sb242,084
administration, they have dissimilar effects on blood ethanol
levels. furthermore, this altered behavioural profile of an
early termination of motivated responding has been
observed for other drug and nondrug reinforcers, following
dexfenfluramine and ro60-0175 administration, for which
altered gastrointestinal motility may not necessarily be
implicated. for example, dexfenfluramine has been reported
to suppress responding for heroin, cocaine and food (blundell, 1984; higgins et al., 1994; wang et al., 1995; glowa
et al., 1997; clifton et al., 2000), while ro60-0175 has been
reported to suppress food intake (clifton et al., 2000) and
reduce break points of cocaine maintained on a progressive
ratio schedule (grottick et al., 2000). taken together, these
data suggest that 5-ht2c receptors play a role in modifying
motivated responding for a wide range of reinforcers in a
similar manner, and not ethanol specifically, and that these
effects are unlikely to be attributable to a general alteration
in measures of performance or kinetics.
the fact that sb242,084 increased ethanol self-administration when administered alone raises the possibility that
its ability to attenuate the effects of both dexfenfluramine
and ro60-0175 on ethanol self-administration may be due
to functional antagonism, as opposed to pharmacological
antagonism at the level of the  xxxg1115xxx  as proposed.
this explanation however, seems unlikely based on the
pharmacological evidence that 5-ht2c receptors exert a
tonic influence over some neurochemical systems (prisco et
al., 1994; di matteo et al., 1998; millan et al., 1998; di
matteo et al., 1999; lucas and spampinato, 2000), and that
the drugs used exhibit high affinity for this receptor
subtype (martin et al., 1998, porter et al., 1999, kennett
et al., 1997). additional studies, that identify lower doses
of sb242,084, that reverse dexfenfluramine’s and ro600175’s effects on ethanol self-administration but do not
influence ethanol intake alone are required to further
support this. the observation that sb242,084 does alter
ethanol intake suggests that the  xxxg1115xxx  subtype
exerts a tonic influence over ethanol self-administration.
the mechanism via which 5-ht2c receptors regulates
ethanol motivated responding is still not known, however,
the discrete localization of this receptor subtype within
some brain regions implicated in reinforcement processes is
intriguing (pompeiano et al., 1994; abramowski et al.,
1995; eberle-wang et al., 1997; clement et al., 2000).
furthermore, 5-ht2c receptors have been shown to exert a
tonic influence over mesolimbic dopamine function (prisco
et al., 1994; di matteo et al., 1998; millan et al., 1998; di

d.m. tomkins et al. / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 71 (2002) 735–744

matteo et al., 1999; lucas and spampinato, 2000). since
this dopaminergic pathway has been shown to play an
important role in regulating many of the behavioural effects
of psychoactive substances, including ethanol, it is conceivable that the effects reported in this study are mediated,
in part, by this system. this is supported by the fact that
discrete nucleus accumbens injections of dopamine agonists, increase, while dopamine antagonists decrease ethanol motivated responding (hodge et al., 1992; samson et
al., 1993). these findings are concordant with the present
study since the 5-ht2c antagonist, sb242,084, increases
both nucleus accumbens dopamine release and ethanol selfadministration behaviour (di matteo et al., 1999), while the
converse is true for the effects of the 5-ht2c agonist,
ro60-0175 (millan et al., 1998, di matteo et al., 2001).
further studies are necessary to more directly examine any
relationship between  xxxg1115xxx -mediated modulation
of mesolimbic dopaminergic function and ethanol selfadministration behaviour.
in summary, the present series of studies demonstrate that
5-ht2c receptors exert tonic control over ethanol selfadministration behaviour by male wistar rats, and that this
receptor subtype plays an important role in the suppressant
effects of the 5-ht releaser, dexfenfluramine, on ethanol
motivated responding. the effects of dexfenfluramine and
the selective 5-ht2c agents on ethanol self-administration
exhibit a similar profile, both in terms of effective doses and
alterations in behavioural responding, to their effects on the
self-administration of other drug and nondrug reinforcers.
this suggests that the  xxxg1115xxx  represents an important neural substrate for regulating motivated behaviours
in general.
