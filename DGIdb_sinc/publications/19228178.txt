an estimated one-third of the general population is affected by insomnia,
and this number is increasing due to more stressful working conditions and
the progressive aging of society. however, current treatment of insomnia
with hypnotics,  xxxd2177xxx  a (gaba a ) receptor modulators,
induces various side effects, including cognitive impairment, motor disturbance, dependence, tolerance, hangover, and rebound insomnia.  xxxd3078xxx 
( xxxd3078xxx ; takeda pharmaceutical company limited, osaka, japan) is an
orally active, highly selective melatonin mt 1 /mt 2 receptor agonist. unlike
the sedative hypnotics that target gaba a receptor complexes,  xxxd3078xxx  is a
chronohypnotic that acts on the melatonin mt 1 and mt 2 receptors, which are
primarily located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the body’s “master clock.”
as such,  xxxd3078xxx  possesses the first new therapeutic mechanism of action
for a prescription insomnia medication in over three decades.  xxxd3078xxx  has
demonstrated sleep-promoting effects in clinical trials, and coupled with its favorable safety profile and lack of abuse potential or dependence, this chronohypnotic provides an important treatment option for insomnia.

introduction
most adults have experienced insomnia or sleeplessness
at one time or another in their lives. an estimated onethird of the general population is affected by insomnia,
and 10–15% have chronic insomnia [1]. although most
of us know what insomnia is and how we feel and perform after one or more sleepless nights, few seek medical
advice. many people remain unaware of the behavioral
and medical options available to treat insomnia. insomnia
affects all age groups. the incidence increases with age,
and among older adults, insomnia affects women more
often than men [2].
the first-generation drugs for insomnia were barbiturates such as pentobarbital and phenobarbital, which
were often used as sedative hypnotics/anxiolytics before
benzodiazepines largely came to be used for these purposes. however, barbiturates have a high abuse potential,
and overdose can cause unconsciousness and even death
due to respiratory suppression [3–5].
benzodiazepines, the second generation of hypnotics,
such as triazolam, lorazepam, and  xxxd2036xxx , have been
32

used for treatment of insomnia, because benzodiazepines
have a low potential for abuse and low danger of
lethal overdose [3,4,6]. however, these hypnotics produce several side effects including cognitive impairment,
psychomotor impairment, dependence, tolerance, hangover, rebound insomnia, and so on [7–10]. then benzodiazepine receptor agonists, the third generation of
hypnotics with non-benzodiazepine chemical structures,
such as zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon, were developed to maintain sleep-inducing action and reduce side
effects such as amnesia and motor dysfunction [11–14].
it has been reported that there is no tolerance during treatment and no or limited rebound insomnia after therapy discontinuation in the long-term use of zaleplon,  xxxd2047xxx , and modified release formulation
of zolpidem [11,15,16]. however, at higher doses, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also cause similar side effects
as those caused by benzodiazepines, although the severity
of side effects differs among specific drugs [11–13,17,18–
20]. benzodiazepine receptor agonists, including nonbenzodiazepines, have abuse and dependence potential. [18,21–23]. furthermore, sleep produced by these

agents is electrophysiologically different from that of
naturally occurring physiological sleep. benzodiazepine
receptor agonists reduce rapid eye movement (rem)
sleep and increase stage 2 sleep [16,24–27]. newer nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, including zopiclone, zaleplon,
and zolpidem, also have been shown to decrease rem
sleep in the first half of the night, although the effects
were milder than those of benzodiazepines such as triazolam and temazepam [25,28,29]. also, electroencephalographic (eeg) power spectral analyses revealed that there
is a decrease in low-frequency (0.25–10.0 hz) activity
and increase in high-frequency activity in non-rem sleep
[24,25,30].
since its discovery in 1958 [31], melatonin has been
shown to play a vital role in the regulation of circadian rhythms, including the sleep–wake cycle [32–34].
the cyclic nature of melatonin’s production by the pineal
gland is controlled by neuronal output from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) of the hypothalamus. with regard
to sleep in humans, melatonin production is concurrent
with nocturnal sleep; the increase in endogenous melatonin levels in the evening correlates with the onset of
self-reported evening sleepiness [35,36] and an increase
in sleep propensity [37].
the identification and cloning of melatonin receptors
has increased our understanding of melatonin’s role in
sleep. in 1998, the nomenclature committee of the international union of basic and clinical pharmacology classified melatonin receptors as mt 1 , mt 2 , and mt 3 . the
mt 1 receptor (formerly ml 1a or mel 1a ) and mt 2 receptor (formerly ml 1b or mel 1b ) were initially defined as
high-affinity binding sites (picomolar affinity) in chick
and mammalian brains and retina [38–42]. mt 1 receptor
mrna has been detected in the scn, and studies using
an mt 1 receptor knockout mouse indicate that this receptor mediates the acute inhibition of scn firing by melatonin [33]. mt 2 receptor mrna has also been detected
in the scn, and the activity at this receptor has been associated with the phase-shifting effects of melatonin on
circadian rhythms [32,43–45]. the mt 3 binding site (formerly ml 2 ) was initially defined as a low-affinity binding
site (nanomolar affinity) in mammalian brains and peripheral organs [46], and it has recently been characterized as a melatonin-sensitive form of quinone reductase
2 [47,48]. mt 3 has a profile that is completely different
from that of the mt 1 and mt 2 receptors, and it is not
likely to be involved in the sleep–wake cycle [49].
the notion that direct administration of exogenous
melatonin could promote sleep has been dampened by
inconsistent efficacy results in clinical trials [50–53]. according to the 2005 national institutes of health (nih)
state-of-the-science conference statement on manifestations and management of chronic insomnia in adults,
melatonin’s effect on sleep promotion is questionable

based on information from meta-analyses and consensus statements. because melatonin is not regulated by the
fda, preparations vary in their melatonin content, making comparisons across studies difficult. although melatonin appears to be effective for the treatment of circadian
rhythm disorders [54–56], little consistent evidence exists for its efficacy in the treatment of insomnia. the limited efficacy of melatonin for insomnia may be partly attributed to its short half-life [57,58]. a controlled-release
melatonin has been shown to improve initiation of sleep
and increase sleep efficiency and total sleep time in clinical trials in elderly people with insomnia [59,60]. these
finding suggests that a high-affinity mt 1 /mt 2 receptor
agonist with a longer half-life than that of melatonin
might be a useful therapy for sleep disorders in this population. recently, there has been a focus on the development of hypnotic agents that selectively target melatonin
receptors [61–63].
 xxxd3078xxx  [(5)-n-[2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2h-indeno
[5,4-b]turan-8-yl)ethyl]propionamide] is a melatonin
receptor agonist that shows high selectivity for the
mt 1 /mt 2 receptors [64]. figure 1 compares the chemical
structures of melatonin and  xxxd3078xxx .  xxxd3078xxx  has
a half-life of 0.83–1.90 h (much longer than that of
melatonin [58]) and undergoes a rapid, high first-pass
metabolism [65,66]. in clinical trials,  xxxd3078xxx  has
demonstrated sleep-promoting effects, with no next-day
residual effects, rebound insomnia, or withdrawal effects,
making it the first available nonscheduled prescription
insomnia medication [16,67–69]. this review summarizes the preclinical data, clinical efficacy, and safety
profile of  xxxd3078xxx .

preclinical pharmacology
neurochemical effects
high afﬁnity for mt 1 /mt 2 receptors
in vitro studies have demonstrated that  xxxd3078xxx  is a
potent and highly selective mt 1 /mt 2 receptor agonist
(table 1) [70]. in studies of chinese hamster ovary (cho)
cells expressing human melatonin receptors,  xxxd3078xxx 
exhibited a 6-fold higher affinity for the mt 1 receptor than that by melatonin [70]. similarly,  xxxd3078xxx 
had a higher affinity for the mt 2 receptor than that of
melatonin. the dissociation equilibrium constant (k d )
and maximal number of binding sites (b max ) values of
 xxxd3078xxx  were 15.0 ± 3.0 pm and 555 ± 114 fm/mg
protein, respectively, for the mt 1 receptor, and 328 ±
12 pm and 133 ± 2 fm/mg protein, respectively, for
the mt 2 receptor. the affinities of  xxxd3078xxx  for the
mt 1 and mt 2 receptors were comparable to those of

in studies of syrian hamster brain, the affinity of
 xxxd3078xxx  for the mt 3 binding site was extremely weak
(k i : 2.65 mum) relative to melatonin and 2- xxxd2377xxx ;
the values being 24.1 nm and 0.924 nm, respectively
[70]. the affinity of  xxxd3078xxx  for the mt 3 binding site
was 1/110 that of melatonin and 1/2750 that of 2iodomelatonin.  xxxd70xxx  and  xxxd3000xxx  also showed
high affinities for the mt 3 binding site [70], as reported
previously [38,71].

agonistic effect on mt 1 /mt 2 receptors
melatonin receptors, when activated, inhibit adenylate cyclase, which leads to a decrease in camp
[73,74].  xxxd3078xxx  demonstrated this agonist activity
at both mt 1 and mt 2 receptors. in cho cells expressing the human melatonin receptors,  xxxd3078xxx 
inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production in a
concentration-dependent manner. [70] the half maximal inhibitory concentration (ic 50 ) values of  xxxd3078xxx

and melatonin for the inhibition of camp production in
cells expressing mt 1 receptors were 21.2 and 77.8 pm,
respectively, and in cells expressing mt 2 receptors, were
53.4 and 904.0 pm, respectively (table 2) [70]. taken together,  xxxd3078xxx ’s affinity and activity at mt 1 /mt 2 receptors and its low affinity for the mt 3 binding site make
it a potentially more suitable sleep-promoting agent than
exogenous melatonin.

effects on other receptors and enzymes
to help differentiate  xxxd3078xxx  from sedative hypnotics
that target the gaba a -receptor complex, investigators
assessed  xxxd3078xxx ’s affinity to gaba and a wide variety
of other cns binding sites [70]. as expected,  xxxd3078xxx 
did not show significant inhibition of binding (>50%)
to 131 g-protein-coupled receptors, transporters, and
ion channels, including monoamine receptors, opioid receptors, central benzodiazepine receptors, and dopamine
transporters tested  xxxd1891xxx  mum [70]. moreover,  xxxd3078xxx 
showed no effect on enzyme activity of 54 tested enzymes  xxxd1891xxx –1000 mum [70]. melatonin caused no significant inhibition of the binding of almost all receptors,
except for 5-ht 1a receptor, for which the k i value was
5.6 mum.  xxxd3078xxx ’s negligible affinity to gaba, serotonin, acetylcholine, glutamate, noradrenaline, opioid,
histamine, and dopamine receptors is noteworthy, as ancillary activity at these receptors may result in unwanted
secondary or residual effects.

sleep-promoting effects
to study the sleep-promoting effects of  xxxd3078xxx  in cats
and monkeys using polysomnography (psg), a chamber was constructed to allow animals to move freely
while being attached to electroencephalogram (eeg) cables [49]. in freely moving cats, the effect of  xxxd3078xxx 
on sleep was stronger and lasted longer than the effect
of exogenous melatonin (fig. 2) [49].  xxxd3078xxx  (0.001,
0.01, and 0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) was shown to promote sleep,
as evidenced by decreases in the percentage of time spent
awake and increases in the percentage of time spent in
slow wave sleep (sws) and rem sleep. the median latency to sleep onset (time to first sws lasting more than
1 min) was 24 min in cats given  xxxd3078xxx  0.1 mg/kg
compared with 60 min in cats given vehicle control. in
contrast, melatonin resulted in a mild sleep-promoting
effect; melatonin (0.001–1.000 mg/kg, p.o.) showed no
statistically significant effect on sleep latency, and the duration of the sleep-promoting action of the highest dose of
melatonin (2 h) was shorter than that of  xxxd3078xxx  (6 h).
 xxxd3078xxx  was shown to cause sleep promotion in
freely moving cats. however, it was not enough for starting clinical trial, because the experimental conditions
were artificial and the effect of  xxxd3078xxx  was on daytime
sleep in cats. it was critical for the project to confirm pharmacological efficacy in primates, focusing on the effect on
nighttime sleep, which is much more close to the clinical
use of  xxxd3078xxx . since there was no evaluation system
to assess psg in freely moving monkeys, the authors developed the psg assay system through a try and error
process [75]. in the study, young adult female crab-eating

macaques (macaca fascicularis), implanted with electrodes
for eeg, electrooculogram (eog), and electromyogram
(emg) recording, were used, well habituated to the
recording chamber located in a soundproof, electrically
shielded room that was maintained under conditions similar to those of the home cage under freely moving unrestrained condition. sleep architecure in the unrestrained
monkeys was similar to that of humans, which was also
confirmed by recent reports [76].
 xxxd3078xxx  (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg, p.o.) showed sleeppromoting effects, as evidenced by statistically significant
increases in total duration of sleep and decreases in latencies to sleep onset (time to the first consecutive 3 min
of sleep stage) of light sleep (sleep stages 1 and 2) and
sws (sleep stages 3 and 4) (figs. 3–5) [75]. melatonin
(0.3 mg/kg, p.o.) showed a statistically significant reduction in latency to onset of light sleep but not of sws
and had no statistically significant effect on sleep duration [75]. the higher doses of melatonin (1 and 3 mg/kg)
had no statistically significant effect on the latencies to
each sleep stage or sleep duration. the benzodiazepine
receptor agonist zolpidem (1–30 mg/kg, p.o.) showed no
statistically significant effects on sleep latencies to each
sleep stage or sleep duration [75]. with regard to observable behavior, monkeys given zolpidem 30 mg/kg
displayed sedation and myorelaxation, whereas monkeys given either  xxxd3078xxx  or melatonin at any doses
showed no apparent motor dysfunction (fig. 5) [75]. as
zolpidem showed marked sedation including myorelaxation at 100 mg/kg, p.o., the authors did not assess the
sleep-inducing action at this dose. they suggested that,
if they conduct the study at 100 mg/kg, it might cause
more apparent effect. therefore, zolpidem might cause
sleep-inducing action at doses exerting marked sedation
in monkeys. a number of studies showed that zolpidem causes potent reduction of sleep latency in humans
[11,14,77], suggesting that there might be a species difference in sleep induction by zolpidem.  xxxd3078xxx  significantly shortened sleep latency and increased total sleep
time in monkeys. similar clinical effects have been confirmed in clinical studies [69,78], suggesting that the preclinical study using monkeys was valid for the prediction
of clinical efficacy in humans.
unlike the zolpidem, which increased eeg fast waves
(>14 hz) during sleep, eeg spectra and a fast fourier
transform (fft) after  xxxd3078xxx  and melatonin administration were indistinguishable from those of naturally
occurring physiological sleep (fig. 6) [75]. eeg power
spectral analyses in humans have shown that treatment
with benzodiazepines or zolpidem caused a significant
reduction of low-frequency activity (0.25–10.0 hz) and
a significant increase in high-frequency activity in
non-rem sleep observed in healthy young subjects

[24,25,30]. therefore, sleep induced by benzodiazepine
receptor agonists may be qualitatively different from natural sleep in terms of eeg findings. eeg spectral analyses
showed that sleep induced by  xxxd3078xxx  and melatonin
was indistinguishable from that of vehicle-treated control
[75], implying that mt 1 /mt 2 receptor agonists may promote physiological sleep in animals.

circadian reentrainment

to assess the ability of  xxxd3078xxx  to shift the circadian
rhythm, a study of running-wheel activity in rats was
conducted [79]. after an abrupt 8-h advance of the light–
dark cycle, the circadian rhythm of running-wheel activity of rats was gradually resynchronized to the new

light–dark cycle. rats treated with  xxxd3078xxx  (0.1 and
1.0 mg/kg, p.o.) took less time to resynchronize to the
new light–dark cycle compared with rats that received
vehicle control (fig. 7). melatonin 10 mg/kg, p.o.,
also accelerated reentrainment of running-wheel activity
rhythm following the phase advance [79]. these results
indicate that  xxxd3078xxx  was closely mimicking the central actions of melatonin as a circadian rhythm signal, not
simply acting as a hypnotic.
the mt 2 receptor had been shown to be important for
the phase-shifting effects of melatonin in the scn [32,43–
45].  xxxd3078xxx  induced phase advance by application at

zeitgeber time (zt) 10 but not at zt 6 in scn slice in
rats. the phase-advancing effect was inhibited by an mt 2
receptor antagonist, 4-phenyl-2-acetamidotetraline [80],
suggesting that mt 2 receptor might be involved in the
phase-advancing effect of  xxxd3078xxx .

on the rota-rod test for motor coordination, mice
treated with  xxxd3078xxx , melatonin, or  xxxd70xxx 
(3–30 mg/kg p.o.) showed no impairment on rota-rod
performance [81]. in contrast, the benzodiazepine diazepam (3–10 mg/kg, p.o.) induced dose-dependent impairment of rota-rod performance; all of the mice in the
diazepam group 10 mg/kg failed the test (fig. 9) [81].
melatonin and  xxxd70xxx  exacerbated the diazepaminduced impairment of performance, whereas  xxxd3078xxx 
did not affect the diazepam-induced motor dysfunction
(fig. 10).

on the conditioned place-preference test for rewarding
property, rats treated with  xxxd3078xxx  (3–30 mg/kg, p.o.)
or melatonin (10–100 mg/kg, p.o.) showed no preference
in the drug-associated compartment, indicating a low potential for reinforcing behavior (fig. 11) [79]. in contrast,
morphine (1 mg/kg, s.c.), triazolam (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.), and
diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) resulted in statistically significant increases in the time spent in the drug-associated
compartment [79], consistent with reports of the rewarding properties that may occur with the use of benzodiazepines [22,82].
on a task to determine if  xxxd3078xxx  produces benzodiazepine receptor agonist-like discriminative stimulus effects, the monkeys were trained to reliably discriminate between subcutaneous injections of vehicle
and the benzodiazepine midazolam using a standard 2lever procedure for shock avoidance [83].  xxxd3078xxx  was
then administered intravenously in lieu of midazolam
at doses of 0.32, 1.0, 3.2, 5.6, and 10.0 mg/kg. after
receiving  xxxd3078xxx , the monkeys responded primarily
on the vehicle-associated lever versus the midazolamassociated lever, indicating that these animals did not
generalize  xxxd3078xxx  to midazolam. in a similar study,
monkeys dependent on diazepam were trained to reliably discriminate between subcutaneous injections of
vehicle and flumazenil (benzodiazepine antagonist) using a standard 2-lever procedure for food presentation
[83].  xxxd3078xxx  was then administered intravenously
at doses of 3.2, 5.6, and 10.0 mg/kg 15 min prior to
increasing doses of flumazenil. the percentage of responses on the flumazenil-associated lever was similar
between  xxxd3078xxx  10 mg/kg and vehicle control, indicating that  xxxd3078xxx  did not attenuate the effect of
flumazenil.
on an operant task to assess a reinforcing effect,
rhesus monkeys were free to self-administer intravenous  xxxd3078xxx  [84]. in the 2-h testing periods, there
were no significant differences in the number of selfadministrations (fixed ratio of 50) of  xxxd3078xxx  at doses
ranging from 0.025–0.400 mg/kg per infusion relative to
vehicle control [84]. in contrast, pentobarbital at doses of
0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg per infusion resulted in statistically significant increases in the number of self-administrations.
when the monkeys were free to self-administer drug
(fixed ratio of 5) around the clock, the mean numbers of self-administrations of  xxxd3078xxx  were comparable to those of vehicle, further indicating that  xxxd3078xxx 
showed no positive reinforcing effect. with regard to
observable behavior, no gross behavioral changes were
noted in monkeys treated with  xxxd3078xxx  or vehicle

changes in body weight, motor activity, posture, or behavior observed during the periods of treatment or after

clinical efﬁcacy and safety
metabolism
rameleteon is metabolized primarily via oxidation to
hydroxyl and carbonyl derivatives, with secondary
metabolism producing glucuronide conjugates [65].
ring-opening biotransformation results in the formation
of m-i, and hydroxylation of the carboxy-metabolite,
m-iii, results in the formation of m-iv (fig. 12) [65].
the major metabolite of  xxxd3078xxx  in serum is the
monohydroxylated metabolite, m-ii. cytochrome p450
(cyp)1a2 is the major isozyme involved in the hepatic metabolism of  xxxd3078xxx ; the cyp2c subfamily and
cyp3a4 isozymes are also involved to a minor degree. the major metabolite in serum was m-ii, having exposure approximately 39-fold greater than that of
 xxxd3078xxx  at the 16-mg dose. the half-life of  xxxd3078xxx 
ranges from 0.83 to 1.90 h, depending on the dose [65],

which is considerably longer than that of melatonin. this
might be regarded as a decisive advantage for the use
of  xxxd3078xxx  as a sleep promoter, because the relatively
poor efficiency of melatonin is presumed to be partly due
to its short half-life [57,58].
m-ii is a major metabolite and is physiologically active, and its affinity for chick mel 1a /mel 1c receptors is
0.675 nm, one-fifth to one-tenth the binding affinity of
 xxxd3078xxx , for the human mt 1 and mt 2 receptors, and
it is 17- to 25-fold less potent than  xxxd3078xxx  in in vitro
functional assays [70]. m-ii also showed a potent sleeppromoting action in freely moving cats [49]. m-ii had no
significant affinities for other receptors or various enzyme
activities, as those of  xxxd3078xxx , suggesting that m-ii is
also an mt 1 /mt 2 receptor selective agonist [70]. however, the levels of other metabolites are low, and also
the affinities for mel 1a /mel 1c receptors are negligible, as
demonstrated by k i values of 36.0 nm for m-iii and
>236 nm for both m-i and m-iv. thus, m-ii may contribute to pharmacological effects of  xxxd3078xxx .

sleep-promoting effects
in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trials, the sleep-promoting effects of the short- and longterm use of  xxxd3078xxx  have been demonstrated in patients with chronic insomnia as well as in healthy subjects subjected to a first-night-effect model of transient
insomnia. overnight monitoring with psg (eeg, eog,
and emg) was used to objectively evaluate the ability of
 xxxd3078xxx  to reduce latency to persistent sleep, maintain
sleep, and increase the duration of sleep. patients’ subjective assessments of sleep were also evaluated with a postsleep questionnaire. latency to persistent sleep (defined
as time in minutes to the first of 20 consecutive epochs of
sleep on psg) [78,85] or patient-reported sleep latency
was the primary measures in these trials.

transient insomnia
 xxxd3078xxx ’s ability to improve transient insomnia was
assessed in two clinical trials that utilized a first-nighteffect model of transient insomnia. in roth et al.’s trial
of 375 healthy subjects unfamiliar with a sleep laboratory environment (i.e., experiencing transient insomnia),
 xxxd3078xxx  at doses of 16 mg and 64 mg produced statistically significant decreases in latency to persistant sleep
and increases in total sleep time, as measured with psg
[85]. the mean latency to persistent sleep was 14.1 and
15.5 min in the  xxxd3078xxx  16-mg and 64-mg groups, respectively, compared with 24.6 min in the placebo group
(p ≤ 0.001 for both groups vs. placebo). the mean total
sleep times were 425.4 and 422.4 min in the 16-mg and
64-mg groups, respectively, compared with 411.3 min in

the placebo group (p ≤ 0.05 for both doses vs. placebo).
according to a post-sleep questionnaire, subjects in the
16-mg group reported statistically significant improvements in subjective sleep latency (p = 0.013; no p-value
reported for subtotal sleep time).  xxxd3078xxx  was not
associated with next-day residual psychomotor impairment, as measured by the digit symbol substitution test
(dsst). however, the use of the  xxxd3078xxx  64-mg dose
was associated with small but statistically significant reductions in subjective next-day levels of alertness and
ability to concentrate relative to placebo. zammit et al.
conducted a similar trial of 289 healthy subjects that
showed that latency to persistent sleep, as measured with
psg, was 12.2 min in the  xxxd3078xxx  8-mg group and
14.8 min in the  xxxd3078xxx  16-mg group compared with
19.7 min in the placebo group; the 8-mg dose reached
statistical significance (p = 0.004) [68]. the mean total
sleep time was 436.8 min and 433.1 min in the 8-mg and
16-mg groups, respectively, compared with 419.7 min in
the placebo group (p ≤ 0.05 for both groups vs. placebo).
subjective measures of sleep latency and total sleep time
were improved, but the differences from placebo were
not statistically significant. in this trial,  xxxd3078xxx  had
no significant effects on the dsst and subjective levels
of alertness and ability to concentrate as well as on other
next-day residual effect measures including memory recall tests and visual analog scales (vas) for mood and
feeling.

of mental disorders (dsm)-iv-tr for at least 3 months)
were also evaluated in clinical trials. figure 13 illustrates the differences from placebo in latency to persistent sleep by dose of  xxxd3078xxx  in these trials. in erman
et al.’s multiple-dose cross-over study of 107 adults with
chronic insomnia, a 2-night administration of  xxxd3078xxx 
resulted in statistically significant reductions in latency
to persistent sleep (p ≤ 0.001) and increases in total
sleep time (p ≤ 0.05), as measured with psg, at each
dose tested (4–32 mg) [78]. interestingly, all doses of
 xxxd3078xxx  produced similar reductions in latency to persistant sleep (13.4–14.8 min more than placebo), with no
apparent dose-dependent effects, and this wide therapeutic window was seen across studies. patients who received
 xxxd3078xxx  16 mg reported significant reductions in subjective sleep latency (p ≤ 0.05); no other statistically sig-

nificant effects in subjective sleep ratings were observed.
 xxxd3078xxx  had no statistically significant effect on nextday residual effect measures including the dsst, memory
recall tests, and patient-reported levels of alertness and
ability to concentrate. however,  xxxd3078xxx  had no significant effect on the mean wake time after sleep onset
(waso).
in zammit et al.’s extended trial in 405 patients with
chronic insomnia,  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg and 16 mg resulted
in improvements in latency to persistent sleep and total sleep time over 5 weeks of nightly treatment, as
measured objectively by psg and subjectively by the
post-sleep questionnaire (fig. 14) [69].  xxxd3078xxx  had
no significant effects on waso.  xxxd3078xxx  showed no
statistically significant effect on the next-day dsst performance. patients in the 8-mg  xxxd3078xxx  group demonstrated a small, but statistically significant, decrease in
the mean score compared with placebo on the immediate memory recall test at week 3 and the delayed memory recall test at week 1. at other time points, no significant differences between  xxxd3078xxx  and placebo were
found on memory function tests. subjective levels of
alertness and ability to concentrate were similar between
the  xxxd3078xxx  groups and placebo with two exceptions:
patients in the  xxxd3078xxx  8-mg group reported statistically significant improvements in the ability to concentrate at week 1 and the level of alertness at week 5.
this trial also included a 2-day placebo runout period
that showed that the discontinuation of  xxxd3078xxx  treatment was not associated with either rebound insomnia
or withdrawal effects, as assessed with the tyer benzodiazepine withdrawal symptom questionnaire (bwsq).

the bwsq is a questionnaire that solicits specific information on 20 symptoms commonly experienced during
withdrawal from benzodiazepine receptor agonists.
in roth et al.’s trial of  xxxd3078xxx  in 100 elderly patients
(≥65 years) with chronic insomnia, a 2-night administration of either  xxxd3078xxx  4 mg or  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg produced statistically significant reductions in latency to persistent sleep and increases in total sleep time, as measured
with psg [86]. the mean latency to persistent sleep was
28.7 min and 30.8 min in the 4-mg and 8-mg groups, respectively, compared with 38.4 min in the placebo group
(p ≤ 0.01 for both groups vs. placebo). the mean total
sleep time was 359.4 min and 362.0 min in the 4-mg and
8-mg groups, respectively, compared with 350.4 min in
the placebo group (p ≤ 0.05 for both groups vs. placebo).
according to the post-sleep questionnaire, patients who
received  xxxd3078xxx  4 mg reported statistically significant
reductions in subjective sleep latency (p ≤ 0.05). there
were no next-day residual effects with either dose of
 xxxd3078xxx , as measured with the dsst, memory recall
tests, and patient-reported levels of alertness or ability to
concentrate.
a large 5-week outpatient trial in 829 older adult patients (≥65 years) with chronic insomnia was conducted
to specifically assess subjective ratings of sleep [87]. in
this trial, nightly administration of either  xxxd3078xxx 
4 mg or  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg produced reductions in patientreported sleep latency and increases in patient-reported
total sleep time at week 1, and these improvements were
sustained throughout the study. at week 1, subjective
sleep latency was 70.2 min in the 4-mg group and
70.2 min in the 8-mg group compared with 78.5 min in
the placebo group (p ≤ 0.01 for both doses vs. placebo).
at week 1, subjective total sleep time was 324.6 min
in the 4-mg group and 321.1 min in the 8-mg group
compared with 313.9 min in the placebo group (p ≤ 0.01
for 4 mg vs. placebo, p = 0.055 for 8 mg vs. placebo).
 xxxd3078xxx  did not show either rebound insomnia or
withdrawal effects, according to subjective sleep latency
and bwsq results during the 7-day placebo runout
period.
in the longest trial of  xxxd3078xxx  to date, 1213 patients with chronic insomnia took open-label  xxxd3078xxx 
(8 mg or 16 mg) nightly for 1 year [88]). patient-reported
sleep was improved by the first week of treatment and
was sustained throughout the remainder of the study.
improvements in sleep latency from baseline at month
1 were 34.0% and 35.1% with the 8-mg and 16-mg
dose, respectively, and continued to improve through
month 6 (44.7% and 49.1%) and month 12 (50.3% and
52.1%). improvements from baseline in patient-reported
total sleep time at month 1 (15.2% and 16.9%), month 6
(21.6% and 22.7%), and month 12 (25.5% and 23.9%)

were also reported with  xxxd3078xxx  8-mg and 16-mg
doses, respectively. there was no evidence of rebound insomnia with  xxxd3078xxx  during the 3-day placebo runout
period.
considering the clinical data thus far,  xxxd3078xxx  has
consistently demonstrated significant sleep-promoting effects, as evidenced by reductions in sleep latency and increases in sleep duration, among patients with chronic
insomnia and subjects with transient insomnia, during
both short-term and long-term treatment, in both the
sleep laboratory and outpatient setting by both objective
psg and subjective reports. the efficacy by subjective reports [87] was weaker than that by objective psg measurement [69,78]. the efficacy was less than that of sedative hypnotics [11,15,2008]. however, the subjective efficacy of  xxxd3078xxx  was more prominent in subjective reports to questionnaire done the next morning in the sleep
laboratory than that in subjective reports done at home,
possibly suggesting that compliance is more important
for subjective evaluation of melatonin receptor agonists.
in 2005,  xxxd3078xxx  was approved in the united states
for the treatment of insomnia characterized by a difficulty in sleep onset. current data suggest that  xxxd3078xxx 
has no significant effects on waso, and the efficacy for
sleep maintenance insomnia has not been confirmed.
further studies are required to clarify the effect on waso
and search for a possible medication for sleep maintenance insomnia, taking into consideration the dosage of
 xxxd3078xxx  and appropriate patient population.

safety
 xxxd3078xxx  was generally well tolerated across the clinical trials. most adverse events were considered mild or
moderate in severity, and very low incidences of adverse
events during  xxxd3078xxx  administration were observed.
only three events were noted to occur at an incidence of
≥2% with  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg (the recommended therapeutic dose) vs. placebo: somnolence (5% vs. 3%), dizziness
(5% vs. 3%), and fatigue (4% vs. 2%).
in the 1-year trial of  xxxd3078xxx  in 1213 adults with
chronic insomnia, the overall incidence of adverse events
was similar at 6 months and 1 year [89]. the adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate. at
1 year, the adverse events most frequently reported
with  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg and 16 mg, respectively, were nasopharyngitis (10.5% and 14.9%), somnolence (9.5%
and 8.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (7.6% and
11.1%), headache (1.9% and 13.5%), and sinusitis
(1.9% and 7.8%). of 38 subjects (3.1%) reporting a serious adverse event, only three adverse events were possibly treatment related. there were no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs, physical examinations, clinical

any dose compared with placebo. in contrast, triazolam
consistently produced a dose-related effect on all these
subjective and behavioral measures, consistent with its
profile as a sedative drug with known abuse potential.
this trial demonstrates that  xxxd3078xxx  does not share the
pharmacologic side effect profile observed among benzodiazepine receptor agonists.

future perspective

adults with chronic insomnia. patients include older adults (≥65 years;
n = 829) with chronic insomnia. placebo,  xxxd3078xxx  4 mg, or  xxxd3078xxx 
8 mg was taken nightly for 5 weeks, and patient-reported sleep data were

chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis values and no electrocardiogram trends to suggest adverse effects on cardiac
function over the 1 year of  xxxd3078xxx  treatment. no notable changes in endocrine and sexual/reproductive function were observed except for the mean free and total
testosterone level, which had a slight decrease in older
men that returned to normal by the final visit of the trial.

abuse liability
benzodiazepine receptor agonists, which are the most
commonly used prescription medications for treatment
of insomnia, have been associated with a potential for
abuse [18,21–23]. all benzodiazepine receptor agonists
(including the newer agents zolpidem, zaleplon, and  xxxd2047xxx ) are classified as schedule iv controlled substances, meaning they possess some potential for abuse
and the adverse consequences of abuse (e.g., withdrawal,
psychomotor impairment, and overdose).
in a study of 14 subjects with a history of sedative hypnotic or anxiety drug abuse,  xxxd3078xxx  doses up to 160
mg (20 times the therapeutic dose) had no effect on a
wide variety of instruments including subject ratings of
mood and behavior, observer rating of mood and behavior, and assessments of behavioral and cognitive performance [67]. figure 15 shows that  xxxd3078xxx  showed
no statistically significant effect at any time point (0.5–
24 h post dose) on representative abuse measures including “liking” scales, the dsst, and circular lights task.
 xxxd3078xxx  had no statistically significant effect on other
questionnaire items “drug strength,” “good effects,” and
“monetary street value.” similarly,  xxxd3078xxx  had no statistically significant effect on word recall/recognition task,
enter and recall task, and balance task performance at

 xxxd3078xxx  has been shown to improve sleep disorders
in patients suffering from transient and chronic insomnia
without causing significant adverse events. however, it
has been suggested that melatonin receptor agonists have
opportunities to cure various diseases, including circadian
rhythm sleep disorders (crsd), depression, alzheimer
disease, bipolar disorder, cancer, hypertension, urinary
incontinence, and so on.
patients with crsd often experience sleep disruption,
daytime fatigue, and impaired mental and physical function. the prevalence of crsd is unknown, but it has been
estimated that 5–10% of patients referred to sleep disorder clinics have a crsd [90]. among blind individuals,
non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome may occur in as many as
50% [91]. transient crsd, such as jet lag and shift-work
syndrome, may be quite common in the general population. as a pharmacologic therapy for crsd, melatonin
has shown some effectiveness [92–94], and a systematic
review of 10 trials concluded that melatonin treatment
(0.5–5.0 mg per day for 2–5 days) is effective for alleviating the symptoms of jet lag after travel across several time
zones [95].
a number of studies have shown altered melatonin
levels in depressed patients and suggested that mood disorders may be related to low melatonin levels, although
the reports were not consistent [96,97]. recently, agomelatin, a melatonin agonist, showed some efficacy in the
treatment of major depressive disorder [98,99].  xxxd95xxx  has been reported to have affinity for 5-ht 2c receptors; however, the affinity was much less than that
for melatonin mt 1 /mt 2 receptor, suggesting that antidepressive effect of  xxxd95xxx  might be related to the effects via activation of mt 1 /mt 2 receptors. furthermore,
reduced melatonin levels and altered timing of melatonin
secretion were observed in patients with bipolar affective
disorder [100,101].
the secretion of endogenous melatonin declines with
aging [102], and this may be related to the sleep–
wake rhythm disturbance in elderly people [103,104].
abnormal decreases in nocturnal melatonin have also
been observed in patients with  xxxg178xxx , another population prone to sleep disturbances [103–105].

administration of melatonin to  xxxg178xxx  patients has been found to improve significantly sleep and
circadian abnormality [106–108]. these findings suggest
that melatonin may play a role in significant regulation
of various physiological functions. thus, further studies
using  xxxd3078xxx , a potent and selective mt 1 /mt 2 receptor agonist well tolerated in humans, to examine its clinical efficacy in these disorders would be interesting and
may provide an insight into treatment options for these
patients.

conclusion
 xxxd3078xxx  shows selective affinity for mt 1 and mt 2 receptors and acts as a full agonist. currently, mt 1 and
mt 2 receptors have been suggested to be related to sleep
promotion and circadian clock such as phase advance.
 xxxd3078xxx  exerts potent sleep promotion in experimental animals including cats and monkeys, without causing
any significant adverse effects such as learning and memory impairment, impairment of motor coordination, and
drug abuse ability. the sleep induced by  xxxd3078xxx  cannot be distinguished from natural sleep using fft analysis
in monkeys, in contrast to the altered sleep pattern produced by current sedative hypnotics.
in clinical trials,  xxxd3078xxx  decreases sleep latency and
increases total sleep time, without causing hangover, addiction, and withdrawal effects. it has no significant effects on psychomotor and cognitive function and does not
show drug abuse potential. taken together, the proven
clinical efficacy of  xxxd3078xxx  combined with its safety
profile positions it as a fourth-generation insomnia treatment worth considering for select patients suffering from
insomnia (table 3). further development of  xxxd3078xxx 
for various diseases or disorders is expected.
