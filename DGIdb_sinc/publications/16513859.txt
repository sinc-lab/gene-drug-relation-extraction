objective: long-acting injectable risperidone represents the first clinically available depot atypical antipsychotic. the
present study used positron emission tomography (pet) to evaluate its dopamine
d2 binding profile at doses of 25, 50, or 75
mg administered every 2 weeks.
method: after achieving stabilization
with one of the doses, nine patients with
a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder underwent [ 11 c]raclopride pet to measure d2 occupancy. participants were scanned twice during the
2-week injection interval: within 3 days
after injection (postinjection) and within 5
days before the next injection (preinjection). at the same time, plasma was collected for measurements of risperidone
plus  xxxd2830xxx .
results: mean post- and preinjection d2
occupancy levels for the 25-, 50-, and 75-

mg doses were 71.0% and 54.0%, 74.4%
and 65.4%, and 81.5% and 75.0%, respectively. there was a significant correlation
between dose and plasma concentrations of risperidone plus  xxxd2830xxx , and the estimated plasma conc e n tr at ion as s o c ia te d w it h 5 0 % d 2
occupancy (ed50 ) was 11.06 ng/ml. prolactin levels were not correlated with
drug levels or d2 occupancy.
conclusions: all three doses of injectable risperidone showed peak d2 occupancy levels above the 65% threshold associated with optimal clinical response;
the 75-mg dose approximated the 80%
threshold linked to increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. doses of 25 or
50 mg should provide therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms.

ong-acting depot antipsychotics were introduced for
clinical use in the 1960s, and among their advantages
compared with oral agents was the greater assurance of
medication delivery, reflected in decreased relapse rates
(1, 2). while the use of depot antipsychotics varied between countries and settings (3, 4), they have proven to be
a useful and important option in our treatment armamentarium (2, 5).
a shift in practice patterns took place in the 1990s with
the influx of a number of novel antipsychotics, and the
clinical advantages of these newer “atypical” agents rapidly positioned them as the treatment of choice for psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia (6–8). despite
their identified benefits, however, adherence has remained an issue (9, 10).
it is only recently, with the introduction of long-acting,
injectable risperidone, that clinicians have had access to a
depot atypical antipsychotic. this formulation represents
an aqueous suspension that contains the drug in a matrix
of  xxxd2219xxx -lactate polymer, and gradual hydrolysis of
the copolymer at the injection site allows slow but steady
release of risperidone over several weeks (11, 12). various
trials have indicated that it is an effective and well-tolerated treatment when administered every 2 weeks (13–16).

positron emission tomography (pet) studies of antipsychotics, focusing in particular on  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy, have proven valuable in understanding the relationship between dose, clinical response, and d2-related
adverse events (e.g., extrapyramidal symptoms). most of
this work has involved oral antipsychotics (17–20), although at least one report with haloperidol  xxxd1821xxx  has
suggested that peak occupancies for the depot are in line
with what is observed in oral formulations (21).
building upon the existing clinical evidence for long-acting risperidone, we set out to evaluate the  xxxg656xxx  occupancy of various doses using pet. the study was not designed as a clinical efficacy trial but rather was intended to
provide occupancy data that, in the context of our current
understanding, could provide additional in vivo evidence
regarding appropriate dosing with this new formulation.

method
subjects were recruited from a multicenter study investigating
the use of long-acting risperidone administered every 2 weeks at
three different doses (25, 50, or 75 mg) in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (13). the pet investigation
was approved by the human subjects review committee of the
university of toronto, and subjects provided written informed
consent after receiving detailed information about the protocol.

details of the multicenter trial have been published elsewhere,
including design and clinical results (13). briefly summarizing,
patients were candidates for a switch to long-acting risperidone if
they met dsm-iv criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and had been stabilized on an oral antipsychotic regimen
for at least 4 weeks. exclusion criteria were current treatment with
clozapine, presence of dsm-iv-defined substance abuse or dependence within the preceding 3 months, a neurological or medical condition that could adversely influence patient safety or
evaluation, pregnancy, demonstrated lack of response to oral risperidone in the past, or concomitant medications that could
compromise d2 evaluation (e.g., nonantipsychotic agents with
dopamine agonist or antagonist properties).
during a 2-week run-in phase, antipsychotics other than oral
risperidone were discontinued and replaced with oral risperidone at flexible doses ranging from 1 to 6 mg/day. thus, all subjects were receiving oral risperidone during this phase, and the
dose of long-acting risperidone that they received thereafter was
dependent on the oral risperidone dose at the end of the run-in
phase. specifically, they were assigned to one of the three doses of
long-acting risperidone as follows: those receiving 1–2 mg/day or
3–4 mg/day of oral risperidone were assigned to the 25-mg and
50-mg doses of long-acting risperidone, respectively; subjects assigned to the 75-mg dose of long-acting risperidone were those
receiving 5–6 mg/day of oral risperidone. supplementary oral risperidone doses (1–6 mg/day) could be used for the first 2–3 weeks
following the switch, although this was not required in any of the
cases reported here.
long-acting risperidone was administered every 2 weeks, and
at least five consecutive injections were administered before pet
was carried out. participants were scanned twice during the 2week injection interval: within 3 days following injection (postinjection) and within 5 days before the next injection (preinjection).
am j psychiatry 163:3, march 2006

the regression line was fit to the following rectangular hyperbolic
equation: occupancy=alpha × [plasma level/(plasma level plus ed50)],
where alpha is the maximal receptor occupancy, and ed50 is the plasma
risperidone plus  xxxd2830xxx  level resulting in 50% maximal receptor occupancy. maximal occupancy alpha was constrained to
100% to reflect the expected maximal occupancy at higher plasma
levels. each subject is represented by two points, representing the
two scans carried out over the course of an injection interval.

d2 occupancy was established using [11c]raclopride following
the same procedure employed at our center and detailed previously (22). pet scanning was conducted using a gems pc2048plus pet scanner (ge medical systems, milwaukee) that produced 15 slices (thickness: 6.5 mm) with a resolution of about 5–6
mm in air. patients were scanned lying down, with fixation of their
heads achieved by use of a thermoplastic face mask (tru-scan
imaging, annapolis, md.).
following injection of 10 mci of high-specific-activity
[11c]raclopride (>300 ci/mmol) using a bolus plus infusion protocol (23–26), a series of emission scans were obtained for 75 minutes. the regions of interest were the caudate/putamen, with the
cerebellum used as a reference region. the regions of interest
were drawn directly on averaged pet images and transferred to
the dynamic pet images to obtain a time activity curve. an average of the striatum/cerebellum ratio minus one obtained between 30 and 75 minutes of scanning was taken as a measure of
the equilibrium binding potential (27). receptor occupancy was
then calculated as the percentage reduction of receptor binding
potential with drug treatment relative to baseline, using age-corrected measures of binding potential from a previously collected
dataset of unmedicated comparison subjects obtained with a
similar methodology. this comparison group consisted of 22
healthy subjects and nine antipsychotic-naive patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder (mean
age=31.5 years, sd=8.51, range=19–47). since the mean binding
potential in the healthy subjects (mean=2.7, sd=0.4) did not differ significantly from that of the antipsychotic-naive subjects
(mean=2.9, sd=0.4) (t=0.98, df=29, p=0.30), the data from the two
groups were combined to obtain the regression equation for the
age-matched estimate of binding potential in the occupancy calculation (binding potential=age ×0.03 + 3.8; r2=0.6).

results
nine participants (seven men and two women) completed the study. the group’s mean age was 34 years (sd=
9, range=21–46), and the dosage breakdown was as follows: 25 mg (n=2), 50 mg (n=5), and 75 mg (n=2).
as seen in figure 1, d2 occupancy levels, measured at
the two time points (postinjection and preinjection) over
the 2-week injection interval, increased in a dose-dependent fashion (25 mg: mean=71.0% [sd=5.7] and 54.0%
[sd=1.4], respectively; 50 mg: mean=74.4% [sd=10.4] and
65.4% [sd=2.1]; 75 mg: mean=81.5% [sd=5.0] and 75.0%
[sd=5.7]). conversely, a comparison across all doses over
the two time points indicated a significant reduction in
both d2 occupancy (t=3.67, df=8, p=0.006) and plasma
concentrations of risperidone plus  xxxd2830xxx 
(t=3.35, df=8, p=0.01). eight of nine participants showed
an expected decline in both of these measures over the
course of the injection interval (table 1). one participant
showed a small increase in occupancy that paralleled a
modest increase in plasma levels (patient 4), but given the
test-retest standard deviation of 6% in our lab this change
is not significant.

venous blood was drawn for drug and prolactin concentrations
at the time of the pet scans. for risperidone, blood samples were
collected in heparinized tubes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at
2500 rpm within 2 hours of collection. separated plasma was
stored at –20°c for transport, and concentrations of risperidone
plus  xxxd2830xxx  were determined by means of a validated radioimmunoassay method (11). prolactin levels were determined by using a two-site chemiluminometric immunoassay
with a minimal detectable limit of 0.3 ng/ml and a coefficient of
variance of 3.6%–4.5% (acs, ciba-corning diagnostics, east walpole, mass.).
statistical analyses were carried out using spss (spss inc., chicago). bivariate correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between the primary variables of interest. nonlinear regression analysis was used in the estim ation of plasma
risperidone plus  xxxd2830xxx  level associated with 50%
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy.

dose showed a significant correlation with plasma risperidone plus  xxxd2830xxx  concentrations (r=
0.63, df=7, p=0.006), even after we controlled for time (r=
0.69, p=0.002). the relationship between plasma concentration and d2 occupancy was captured by a saturating hyperbola (bmax constrained to 100%), with the estimated
plasma concentration associated with 50% d2 occupancy
(ed50) being 11.06 ng/ml (95% confidence interval=9.15–
12.96) (figure 2).
mean prolactin values at the two time points (postinjection and preinjection) over the 2-week injection interval
were 57.11 µg/liter (sd=44.97) and 44.59 µg/liter (sd=
38.30), respectively, representing a nonsignificant difference (t=0.74, df=23, p=0.47). there was no significant correlation between prolactin concentrations and plasma
concentrations of risperidone plus  xxxd2830xxx 
(r=0.32, p=0.12) or  xxxg656xxx  occupancy (r=0.34, p=0.10).
we sampled only a small subgroup of the larger clinical
sample, and the specific findings of the latter have been
reported elsewhere (13). all subjects participating in the
pet study either remained stable or showed clinical improvement during the trial, with the exception of one individual (patient 8) who showed a 1-point clinical global
impression deterioration. extrapyramidal symptom
scores, as measured by the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale, remained low in all dose groups throughout the
pet study.

discussion
with any new medication, it is critical that guidelines regarding optimal dosing be established. previous pet data
have indicated that optimal clinical response occurs when
at least 65% of striatal d2 receptors are occupied, while the
risk of extrapyramidal symptoms increases notably at d2
occupancy levels above 80% (17, 18). the present findings
indicate that long-acting injectable risperidone, even at a
dose of 25 mg every 2 weeks, exceeds the threshold associam j psychiatry 163:3, march 2006

ated with clinical response. as expected, d2 occupancy was
dose-dependent, with only the highest dose employed (75
mg) approximating the threshold that has been associated
with extrapyramidal symptoms in previous studies.
these findings suggest that for most patients treated
with long-acting risperidone, clinical efficacy should be expected at doses of 25–50 mg. this corroborates the existing
clinical evidence showing no additional clinical benefit at
higher doses (14). moreover, our pet results suggest that
dosing at 75 mg every 2 weeks may be associated with
some degree of increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, supporting the observation of a dose-dependent risk
of extrapyramidal symptoms in the clinical setting (14).
mean d2 occupancy levels toward the end of the injection interval for the 50- and 75-mg doses exceeded 65%,
while for the 25-mg dose the end-of-interval occupancy
level was 54%. at first glance, these data might be seen as
suggesting that individuals receiving 25 mg would be vulnerable to relapse toward the end of the injection interval.
however, maintenance of d2 occupancy levels above the
65% threshold may not be necessary for clinical response.
it has been shown, for example, that individuals can be
stabilized on a regimen of haloperidol  xxxd1821xxx  administered every 4 weeks, despite mean d2 occupancy levels decreasing from 73% (range=60%–82%) at week 1 to 53%
(range=20%–74%) at week 4 (21). indeed, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that there may be clinical
advantages to avoiding sustained, high d2 blockade (28).
previous work from our center with oral risperidone,
which evaluated the relationship between d2 occupancy
and risperidone plus  xxxd2830xxx , established
an ed50 of 6.08 ng/ml (95% ci=4.8–7.3) (29). in contrast,
the calculated ed50 here was 11.06 ng/ml (95% ci=9.15–
12.96). this discrepancy may reflect study group size: in
the first report the curve was established based on nine
data points, including one significant outlier, whereas the
current estimate was constructed from twice as many data
points. there are well-recognized concerns regarding the
impact of inter- and intraindividual variability in plasma
antipsychotic levels and efforts to establish “therapeutic
windows” (30–32). bearing in mind this caveat, the current
estimate actually dovetails nicely with a more recent review of this topic suggesting an optimal therapeutic range
for risperidone plus  xxxd2830xxx  of 20–60 ng/ml
(33). as seen in figure 2, 20 ng/ml is associated with 65%
d2 occupancy, while 60 ng/ml represents 84% d2 occupancy. thus, the lower level meets the threshold associated with optimal clinical response, whereas the upper
limit is just over the threshold linked to increased extrapyramidal symptom risk (18), which in turn may compromise clinical outcome.
the lack of correlation between prolactin and d2 occupancy was not entirely unexpected, since factors mediating prolactin secretion are complex (34). our own examination of this issue has in the past provided mixed results
(17, 22), and efforts to establish a threshold for hyperproam j psychiatry 163:3, march 2006

lactinemia in the same fashion as clinical response and extrapyramidal symptoms have not met with the same degree of agreement (17, 35).
a comment is warranted regarding timing of the pet
scans in this study and the actual pharmacokinetics of
long-acting risperidone. the two points used here were
chosen to reflect the time frame of the recommended 2week injection interval, and in so doing provide a reflection of occupancy through the cycle of treatment at steady
state. this needs to be distinguished, however, from the
actual pharmacokinetics of single- and multiple-dose
long-acting risperidone (11). according to single-dose
data an injection’s peak occurs approximately 4–6 weeks
later, meaning that the main release phase is not observed
until after several injection intervals. over the course of an
injection interval at steady state, concentrations of the active moiety (c max to c min ) decrease by approximately
50%–60%, and while this rate of decrease is notably greater
than what is observed in terms of changes in d2 occupancy, we are reminded that a significant dissociation between brain and plasma kinetics in this regard has been
reported with antipsychotics (36).
at least several limitations qualify our conclusions. pet
studies of this sort involve limited numbers of patients,
much smaller than what would be required to definitively
analyze the relationship between dose/receptor occupancy and response/side effects. as a result, to make clinical inferences we must extrapolate the d2 occupancy data
to other larger clinical trials (13, 14). in addition, by focusing on the d2 story we do not address the potential contribution of other receptors and systems in a class of medications that are best characterized by their pharmacological
heterogeneity (37–39). even confining our comments to
d2, the use of [11c]raclopride as the ligand focuses on striatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy. however, it can be argued that
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy in other areas is involved in clinical
response and that, further, there is evidence that atypical
agents may show differential d2 occupancy between striatal and extrastriatal regions (40–47). however, having
raised each of these concerns, we are somewhat reassured
by the fact that the present data are in line with existing
clinical trial and plasma drug data (13, 14, 33) as well as recently published pet data from another center (48).
in this particular study, patients were first switched to
oral risperidone and then to the depot risperidone formulation on the basis of the final oral dose. establishing comparable doses between the two formulations is complicated by the more complex pharmacokinetics of longacting risperidone and differences in bioavailability. however, the pet data now available lend support to the position that long-acting risperidone doses of 25–75 mg are in
line with oral risperidone doses of 2–6 mg (48).
in summary, the pet findings reported here support
available clinical evidence indicating that dosing long-acting risperidone at 25–50 mg every 2 weeks is sufficient in attaining clinical response with minimal risk of extrapyramiajp.psychiatryonline.org
