hydroxyl-substituted sulfonylureas as potent inhibitors of specific [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to rat brain synaptosomes.  we are seeking to discover potent cns-active sulfonylureas with structural features that allow for the formation of several types of prodrugs. we report herein the syntheses of compounds comprising an initial series of hydroxyl-substituted analogues of the potent atp-sensitive  xxxg1232xxx  blockers  xxxd2215xxx  ( xxxd2215xxx ) and  xxxd2205xxx . somewhat unexpectedly, several of the compounds were found to be comparably potent to  xxxd2215xxx  as inhibitors of specific [(3)h] xxxd2215xxx  binding in rat brain preparations.
