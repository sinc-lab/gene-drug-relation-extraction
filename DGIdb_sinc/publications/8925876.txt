abstract

the potency of the antipsychotic drug, risperidone, to antagonize ala-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction in rat vas deferens
and vasoconstriction in rat perfused kidney, and am-adrenoceptor-mediated contractions in spleen from guinea-pig and mouse
was evaluated and compared to that of al-adrenoceptor subtype-discriminating antagonists.  xxxd3000xxx  was found to be
unselective; 2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)aminomethyl-l,4-benzodioxane (wb 4101), 5-methyl-urapidil, indoramin and (+)niguldipine were confirmed as selective for the ala-adrenoceptor , whereas spiperone was weakly a~b-selective. risperidone was
equipotent to  xxxd3000xxx  at ala-adrenoceptors in rat vas deferens and kidney. however, at guinea-pig and mouse splenic
ala-adrenoceptors, the affinity values of risperidone were 10-fold lower than those of  xxxd3000xxx . thus, in functional experiments
the presumed high selectivity of risperidone for the b subtype of al-adrenoceptors could not be confirmed, the drug instead
appears to be moderately selective (10-fold) for the a subtype.

1. introduction

on the basis of both functional and radioligand
binding experiments two a l - a d r e n o c e p t o r subtypes,
designated ala and alb, were initially identified (morrow and creese, 1986; h a n et al., 1987). additionally,
molecular biological techniques have allowed cloning
and expression of three receptors, i.e. alb (cotecchia et
al., 1988), alc (schwinn et al., 1991), and aid (lomasney et al., 1991). the current evidence for the relationship between pharmacologically defined (upper case)
and cloned (lower case) a l - a d r e n o c e p t o r s indicates
that: (1) the alb clone corresponds to the alb-adrenoceptor; (2) the aid clone seems to represent a novel
subtype, i.e. the axd-adrenoceptor; (3) the ale clone
corresponds to the ala-adrenoceptor (bylund et al.,
1994; forray et al., 1994). various antagonists are now
available that are selective for the a versus the b
subtype of al-adrenoceptors, e.g. 2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)aminomethyl- 1,4-benzodioxane (wb

4101), 5-methyl-urapidil, (+)-niguldipine, indoramin
and tamsulosin (boer et al., 1989; forray et al., 1994).
some of these antagonists also exhibit higher affinity at
ala- than at a l o - a d r e n o c e p t o r s , i.e. 5-methyl-urapidil,
indoramin and (+)-niguldipine (forray et al., 1994;
blue et al., 1995). only two compounds have so far
been described as am-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists, i.e. the antipsychotic drugs, spiperone and
risperidone, which exhibit up to 13- and even 120-fold
higher binding affinity, respectively, at a m- than at
a~a-adrenoceptors (michel et al., 1989; sleight et al.,
1993). in addition to this use of subtype-discriminating
antagonists, the sensitivity of mainly ala-adrenoce ptor-mediated effects to ca 2+ channel blockade and the
sensitivity of a~b- and ald-adrenoceptor-mediated effects to the irreversible antagonist, chloroethylclonidine, have been used to differentiate between the three
subtypes of a l - a d r e n o c e p t o r s in various tissues (hart et
al., 1987; for a recent review, see bylund et al., 1994).
in view of the reported higher b versus a subtype
selectivity of risperidone (sleight et al., 1993) than of
spiperone, it was now aimed to assess the selectivity of
risperidone in functional experiments with rat vas def-

erens and rat perfused kidney for determination of
antagonist affinity and potency, respectively, at the a
subtype (han et al., 1987; eltze and boer, 1992; ford
et al., 1994; blue et al., 1995). spleen from guinea-pig
was used for assessing affinity at the b subtype of
al-adrenoceptors (eltze, 1994). in addition, we performed contraction experiments with mouse spleen,
which has characteristics regarding antagonist affinities, resistance to ca 2+ channel blockade and sensitivity to chloroethylclonidine identical to those of guineapig spleen am-adrenoceptors (eltze, 1995). most of
the antagonist affinities and potencies at a~-adrenoceptor subtypes in rat vas deferens, rat kidney and
guinea-pig spleen used for comparison have been published previously (eltze and boer, 1992; eltze, 1994).

2. materials and methods

2.1. affinity and potency of antagonists at ala-adrenoceptors in rat vas deferens and rat perfused kidney
experiments were done with cumulatively added
( - ) - n o r a d r e n a l i n e (10-7-3 >( 10 -5 m in 0.5 log increments) as the agonist to evoke isotonic contractions of
rat prostatic vas deferens segments in the absence and
presence (20-min equilibration) of antagonists and in
the presence of cocaine (10 -5 m) (eltze and boer,
1992). the results were used for calculation of antagonist affinities (pa 2 values).
the potency of antagonists to reverse the vasoconstriction evoked by ( - ) - n o r a d r e n a l i n e (6 × 10 -7 m) in
constant-pressure (100 c m h 2 0 ) perfused rat kidney
was studied using a technique described previously
(eltze and boer, 1992). briefly, once the vasoconstriction induced by continuously present ( - ) - n o r a d r e n a line had stabilized, increasing doses of the test drugs
(100 /~1) were injected within 2 s into the renal infow

tract and the resulting percent reversal of vasoconstriction was recorded. the - l o g eds0 (mol) values for
half-maximal reversal of vasoconstriction were calculated by non-linear regression analysis. for practical
reasons, - l o g eds0 (mol) values instead of time consuming pa 2 values were determined for the antagonists. we have previously shown that there exists an
excellent correlation between antagonist potencies
( - log eds0 mol) to reverse ( - )-noradrenaline-induced
vasoconstriction in rat perfused kidney and (i) antagonist affinities (pk i) for ala-adrenoceptor binding sites
in rat cortical membranes labeled with [3h] xxxd3000xxx 
and (ii) their functional affinities (pa 2) at rat vas
deferens ala-adrenoceptors (eltze and boer, 1992).
some antagonist data were taken from a previous
paper (eltze and boer, 1992). additional experiments
with rat vas deferens were done with risperidone and
indoramin, and those with rat kidney, with risperidone,
 xxxd3000xxx  and indoramin.

2.2. affinity of antagonists at alb-adrenoceptors in
guinea-pig and mouse spleen
isometric contractions of guinea-pig isolated spleen
strips evoked by cumulative administration of ( - ) - n o r adrenaline (3 x 10-8-10 -4 m in 0.5 log increments) in
the absence and presence (30-min equilibration) of test
drug were used to evaluate antagonist affinity (pa 2
value) at alb-adrenoceptors. these experiments were
performed as described previously (eltze, 1994). similarly, isolated spleen strips prepared from mice (male,
25-30 g) previously anaesthetized by a short exposure
to isoflurane (forene, abbott) were mounted in 10-ml
organ baths. isometric contractions in response to cumulatively added ( - ) - n o r a d r e n a l i n e (10-8-10 -4 m in
1.0 log increments) in the presence of 3 × 10 - 7 m
desipramine, 3 x 10 -5 m corticosterone and 10 - 6 m
propranolol were measured. antagonist affinities (pa 2

values) at the guinea-pig and mouse spleen alb-adrenoceptors were calculated as described for the guineapig spleen experiments (eltze, 1994). most antagonist
data on guinea-pig spleen were taken from this paper.
additional experiments on this tissue were done with
risperidone and indoramin.

2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane hci (wb 4101), (rbi, cologne, germany). all
other drugs were purchased from sigma (munich, germany).

3. results

3.1. vas deferens and perfused kidney of the rat
risperidone (10-9-10 -7 m), equilibrated with rat
vas deferens for 20 min, caused a parallel shift to the
right of the (-)-noradrenaline concentration-response
curve without affecting the maximum response to the
agonist, indicating competitive antagonism at alaadrenoceptors in this tissue (not shown). the pa 2
value obtained from the constrained schild plot was
9.08 (pa 2 = 9.03 at a slope = 1.05, not significantly
different from 1.00, p > 0.05). similarly, indoramin
(10-8-3 × 10 -7 m) competitively antagonized contractions in response to (-)-noradrenaline in rat vas deferens, yielding a pa 2 value of 8.52 (pa 2= 8.38 at a
slope = 1.13, not significantly different from 1.00, p >
0.05) (table 1).
during vasoconstriction evoked in rat perfused kidneys by (-)-noradrenaline (6 x 10 -7 m), when there
was a stable and reproducible decrease of 75-80% in
perfusion flow, injections of increasing doses of risperidone (10-11-10 -9 mol) caused a dose-dependent and
reversible increase in perfusion flow (not shown). the
- log eds0 (mol) value for a half-maximal antivasoconstrictor effect for risperidone was 10.29. the - l o g
eds0 (mol) values for the other antagonists investigated with rat perfused kidney were 10.35 for  xxxd3000xxx 
and 9.97 for indoramin (table 1). other antagonist
data on rat kidney were taken from a previous paper
(eltze and boer, 1992).

3.2. spleen strips from guinea-pig and mouse
in isolated spleen strips from guinea-pigs and mice,
risperidone, equilibrated with the tissues for 30 min
(3 × 10-9-10 -7 m in guinea-pig spleen, 10-8-3 x 10 -7
m in mouse spleen), caused competitive antagonism
against (-)-noradrenaline-induced smooth muscle

contractions (not shown). the pa 2 values obtained
from constrained schild plots amounted to 8.12 in
guinea-pig spleen (pa 2 = 8.15 at a slope = 0.97, not
significantly different from 1.00, p > 0.05), and 8.06 in
mouse spleen (pa 2 = 8.12 at a slope = 0.94, not significantly different from 1.00, p > 0.05). similarly,  xxxd3000xxx  ( 1 0 - 9 - 1 0 - 7 m), wb 4101 (10-8-3 x 10 - 7 m),
5-methyl-urapidil (3 × 10-7-10 -5 m), indoramin (3 x
1 0 - 7 - 3 x 1 0 -5 m), (+)-niguldipine (10 -6 m) and
spiperone (10-8-3 x 10 -7 m), caused parallel shifts to
the right of the (-)-noradrenaline concentration-response curves in mouse spleen, indicating competitive
antagonism. schild plots for all antagonists investigated
with this tissue were linear and yielded slopes of regression not significantly different from unity ( p >
0.05). the pa 2 values obtained for the antagonists are
listed in table 1. there was excellent agreement for
antagonist affinities from experiments with mouse
spleen and those with guinea-pig spleen. the small but
negligible difference in antagonist affinities, not exceeding 0.3 log units (factor of 2.0), could suggest
al-adrenoceptor identity, i.e. the b subtype, in spleen
smooth muscle from both species.

nist potency and affinity rank order for the drugs were
obtained in experiments at ala-adrenoceptors in rat
kidney and rat vas deferens, respectively: (+)-niguldipine (not determined in vas deferens) > wb 4101 > 5methyl-urapidil > risperidone =  xxxd3000xxx  > indoramin
> spiperone, which markedly differed from the order
observed at alb-adrenceptors in spleen from both
guinea-pig and mouse:  xxxd3000xxx  > spiperone =
risperidone = wb 4101 > 5-methyl-urapidil = indoramin > (+)-niguldipine. at a~a-adrenoceptors in rat
kidney and vas deferens, risperidone showed high
affinity and was undistinguishable from  xxxd3000xxx . however, antagonism at alr-adrenoceptors in spleen from
guinea-pig and mouse was lo-fold weaker with risperidone than with  xxxd3000xxx .

4. discussion

the pharmacological profile of the antipsychotic
drug, risperidone, includes interaction with al-adrenoceptors, for which the compound has been reported to
have an up to 120-fold higher binding affinity at the b
subtype (pk i = 8.64 in rat hippocampus, p k i = 8.29 in
rat spleen) over the a subtype (pk i = 6.55 in rat hippocampus) (sleight et al., 1993), whereas no data on its
affinity at ald-adrenoceptors are known. in the present study, we have tried to replicate these findings for
the presumed alb-adrenoceptor selectivity of risperidone by using functional experiments, i.e. vas deferens
and perfused kidney of the rat for the a subtype (han
et al., 1987; eltze and boer, 1992; blue et al., 1995),
and spleen from guinea-pig and mouse for the b subtype of ax-adrenoceptors (eltze, 1994, 1995). we have
previously shown that the binding affinities of a number of antagonists at rat cortical ala-adrenoceptors
correlate highly significantly with their potencies to
antagonize contraction in rat vas deferens and to reverse vasoconstriction in rat kidneys evoked by ( - ) noradrenaline, making both tissues reliable functional
assay material for investigating the a subtype of a~adrenoceptors (eltze and boer, 1992; ford et al., 1994;
blue et al., 1995).
although all existing subtypes of a~-adrenoceptors
have been found to be expressed in rat vas deferens,
functional studies on this tissue originally performed by
han et al. (1987) demonstrated a~a-adrenoceptors to
be the predominant subtype involved in contraction.
the affinities of a number of subtype-discriminating
antagonists and the resistance to chloroethylclonidine
of contraction typically display an a~a-adrenoceptor
profile and exclude alb- or ald-adrenoceptors as participants in contraction of this tissue (eltze and boer,
1992; bylund et al., 1994; ford et al., 1994). particularly, the relatively high affinity values obtained for
5-methyl-urapidil and indoramin in rat vas deferens

(pa 2 = 9.10 and 8.52, respectively) are consistent with
their affinities at cloned ala-adrenoceptors (pk i = 8.7
and 8.4, respectively; forray et al., 1994) but differ
from the respective values at native alb-adrenoceptors
in mouse and guinea-pig spleen (pa 2 = 6.9-7.0 and
6.7-6.8, respectively) and at cloned alb-adrenoceptors
(pk i = 6.8 and 7.4, respectively; forray et al., 1994).
this also holds true for the affinities of these antagonists at cloned ald-adrenoceptors (pki = 7.9 and 6.7,
respectively; forray et al., 1994).
on the other hand, the affinity characteristics of
antagonists to inhibit smooth muscle contraction in
guinea-pig spleen closely resemble the characteristics
at am-adrenoceptors from rat liver, but differ clearly
from those at the a subtype in rat vas deferens and rat
cortex (eltze, 1994). a further functional assay for the
b subtype we used was the isolated mouse spleen
(eltze, 1995). the sensitivity of contractions of this
tissue to the alb-adrenoceptor-inactivating agent,
chloroethylclonidine (6 × 10 -5 m), the total resistance
of contractions to ca 2+ channel blockade by (_+)isradipine (10 -7 m) and the affinity profile of
subtype-discriminating antagonists, e.g. the relatively
low affinities of 5-methyl-urapidil, indoramin and ( + ) niguldipine ( p a 2 = 7.03, 6.69 and 6.26, respectively;
this paper), show spleen from mice, like that of the rat
(han et al., 1987), rabbit (schwinn et al., 1991) and
guinea-pig (eltze, 1994), to have the b subtype of
a~-adrenoceptor.
these reliable functional methods confirmed the
reference antagonists wb 4101, 5-methyl-urapidil, indoramin and (+)-niguldipine as selective for alaadrenoceptors in rat vas deferens and kidney, as opposed to alb-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig and mouse
spleen (ala > am), whereas  xxxd3000xxx  was unselective
in these tissues (a~a = a~b). in contrast to spiperone,
which shows an at least 3- to 5-fold selectivity for
guinea-pig and mouse spleen alb-adrenoceptors (pa 2
= 8.05 and 8.29, respectively) over rat vas deferens
ata-adrenoceptors (pa 2 = 7.63), risperidone shows an
inverse selectivity in these tissues (ala > alb). risperidone thereby qualitatively resembles wb 4101, but
with a minor (10-fold) selectivity for the a subtype as
calculated from the difference in affinity at rat vas
deferens ala-adrenoceptors (pa 2 = 9.08) and at
guinea-pig or mouse spleen alb-adrenoceptors (pa 2 =
8.12 and 8.06, respectively).
in summary, whereas these functional experiments
confirmed the selectivity of wb 4101, 5-methyl-urapidil, indoramin and (+)-niguldipine for the a subtype
and weak selectivity of spiperone for the b subtype,
they showed risperidone to be moderately selective
(10-fold) for the a subtype of al-adrenoceptors. the
reason for the discrepancy between the antagonist
affinities and selectivity of risperidone found in the
present functional experiments and those reported from

m. eltze / european journal of pharmacology 295 (1996) 69-73
b i n d i n g s t u d i e s ( s l e i g h t e t al., 1 9 9 3 ) still r e m a i n s u n clear. as a result, the possible usefulness of risperidone for a~-adrenoceptor discrimination, at least for
the a and b subtype, appears limited.
