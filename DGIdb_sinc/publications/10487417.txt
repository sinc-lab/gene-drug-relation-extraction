abstract: brain succinate dehydrogenase (sdh) activity was inhibited by in vitro  xxxd2274xxx  (hcp)
with a half inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 0.65 @
10!3 m. the hcp exerted noncompetitive inhibition at
0.5 mm (,ic50), uncompetitive inhibition at 0.65 mm
($ic50), and mixed-type inhibition at 0.8 mm (.ic50)
on sdh activity. the brain sdh demands more energy
of activation (de) in the presence of hcp. the ionizable groups of sdh such as the sulfhydral group of
cysteine and a-amino groups of cysteine were not altered qualitatively in the presence of hcp. q 1999 john

materials and methods
maintenance of experimental animals
adult wistar strain rats (150 5 10 g) obtained from
the veterinary college in bangalore were housed in
polythene cages and maintained at a temperature of 30
5 28c and with relative humidity at 70%. the animals
were fed with rat feed supplied by hindustan lever
ltd., bombay, and water ad libitum.

introduction
extensive use of  xxxd2274xxx  (hcp) in medical, agricultural, and consumer products has been
questioned because of the inherent toxicity attributed
to this compound. symptoms of hcp poisoning are
primarily neurological [1–3]. but even in lethal cases,
the morphological changes in the brain are limited to
a mild spongy degeneration of white matter, which is
yet to be related to precise biochemical alterations [4].
recent studies demonstrate that hcp is a potent uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation and inhibits the
glycolytic and oxidative pathways in different tissues
of the rat during sublethal and paralytic dose treatments [5]. although there are several reports of the
inhibitory action of hcp on different dehydrogenases
[6,7], no previous studies have been published on the
kinetic pattern of inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (sdh) by hcp. since hcp interferes with the encorrespondence to: v. lokanatha.

enzyme assay
the mitochondrial fraction of the brain was isolated by the differential centrifugation method of koch
[8] using a beckman ultracentrifuge (model l7-55). the
mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in a sucrose solution and was used as an enzyme source for the kinetic studies of sdh (e.c.1.3.99.1) throughout the
study. the sdh activity was assayed by the method of
nachlas et al. [9], as modified by prameelamma and
swami [10]. the protein content in the enzyme source
was determined by the method used by lowry et al.
[11].

chemical tests
to study the effect of hcp on sdh, hcp (2,2,methylenebis-3,4,6-trichlorophenol, 99.8% pure, sigma
chemical co., usa) was dissolved in 80% ethanol. the
required quantity of this preparation (maximum 20 ll)
of hcp was added into the reaction mixture of sdh
to obtain desired final concentration of hcp. the control assays contained isovolumetric quantity of 80%
ethanol that contained no hcp.

was studied at selected hcp concentrations, namely,
0.5 mm (,ic50), 0.65 mm (4ic50), and 0.80 mm
(.ic50), using the least-squared method of dixon and
webb [13]. the inhibitory constants (ki and ki8) for
sdh in the presence of hcp were estimated using
dixon [14] and cornish–bowden [15] plots. the activation energy (d e) values were calculated using the
arrhenius equation for both control and experimental
assays of sdh. the alterations in the ionization pattern
of sdh were studied from the plots of log vmax vs. ph
and pkm vs. ph as described by dixon [14].

statistical analysis
the statistical significance was calculated using
the student’s t-test.

sdh kinetics
in vitro inhibitor sensitivity of hcp on sdh was
studied by adding different concentrations of hcp
(0.05 mm to 1.0 mm) to the reaction mixture in order
to determine the half inhibitory concentration (ic50)
[12]. the cooperativity of hcp to the enzyme was assessed by measuring the hill coefficient (n8). in vitro
effect of hcp on substrate kinetics such as maximal
velocity (vmax) and michaelis–menten constant (km)

rat brain sdh activity was significantly inhibited
by different concentrations of in vitro hcp. the ic50 for
hcp, determined by the method of job et al. [12], was
found to be 0.65 mm, with confidence limits (99.7%)
ranging between 0.6 and 0.75 mm of hcp when 1 mg
of mitochondrial protein was used in the enzyme assay.
the hill plot exhibited bilinearity, showing sharp
transition at higher concentrations of hcp (figure 1).
the interaction coefficient (n8) was 2 at hcp concentrations below ic50, and at higher concentrations
(.ic50), a value of 8 was recorded. these findings reflect that the minimum number of inhibitory binding
sites per enzyme molecule may be 2 or 8 [14], assuming
that hcp does not irreversibly inhibit or denature the
enzyme. similar sort of cooperative binding of hcp
and other bisphenols to other enzymes has been reported earlier [3,16].the inhibitor constant (ki) was determined from the plot of reciprocal velocity vs. hcp
concentration, which denotes the dissociation constant
of the ei complex. a similar dissociation constant of
the eis complex (ki8) was also determined from the
plot of s/v vs. hcp concentration (cornish–bowden
plot) [15]. both ki and ki8 determined from the above
two plots, were found to be the same, which indicates
that the dissociation constants of both the ei and eis
complex were unaltered. the maximal velocity (vmax)
and michaelis–menten constant (km) were determined
from the lineweaver–burk double reciprocal plot [17]
(1/s vs. 1/v). the decreased vmax and a nonsignificant
change in km at 0.5 mm of hcp (ic50) suggested that
hcp at this concentration exerted a noncompetitive inhibition on sdh. similarly, in the presence of ic50 concentration of hcp (0.65 mm), it exerted an uncompe-

titive inhibition on sdh as evidenced by the decrease
in both vmax and km values (table 1; figure 2). however, hcp imposed a mixed type of inhibition at 0.80
mm (ic50) on sdh as revealed by an increase in km and
a decrease in vmax. thus, it can be assumed that hcp
causes different degrees of inhibition on sdh and that
the pattern of inhibition is dependent on the concentration of hcp.
the effect of temperature on the sdh activity was
studied in the presence of the ic50 of hcp. the opti-

mum activity of sdh was observed at 378c in both
control and experimental assays (table 1). the apparent activation energy (de) values for sdh in the absence of hcp were increased in the presence of hcp,
suggesting that the enzyme is catalytically less efficient
in the presence of hcp. hence, the hcp-induced inhibition on sdh may also be due to the relative increase in the activation energy values in addition to
the complex interaction observed between enzyme and
hcp [18]. from the arrhenius plots (figure 3), it is
observed that the enzyme activity was increased with
the raise of temperature up to 378c. above 378c, the
graph showed a discontinuity with the change in the
slope. this infliction in the arrhenius plot may be
caused by a change in the rate- limiting step of the
reaction with a change in the temperature or by the
transition of the enzyme from one conformational state
to another [19]. such a break in the arrhenius function
at temperatures above 378c is probably a result of
hcp-induced transconformational change in the enzyme protein [4].the ph-dependent kinetics of sdh
showed optimum activity at ph 8.5 both in control and
experimental assays, suggesting that hcp did not
cause any significant alteration in the ph- dependent
activity pattern of sdh. however, the activity was generally decreased in the presence of hcp at all ph values compared with the control assays. because ph
variation affects the ionization pattern of the enzyme–
substrate es complex and influences the vmax of the

reaction, the ionizable groups or the prototropic
groups of the enzyme active site were determined. the
pk values of sdh were determined by plotting ph vs.
log vmax using the method of dixon [14] (figure 3). the
pk values obtained from this relationship were 7.75
and 8.8 for control sdh, and 7.65 and 8.9 for experimental sdh. by matching the pk values with the standard table [13,20], it was found that brain sdh contains sulfhydryl groups of cysteine and a-amino
groups of cysteine as prototropic groups involved in
the active centers of sdh, which are essentially involved in the catalysis. it was further observed that the
ionizable groups of sdh remained unaltered in the
presence of hcp, suggesting that hcp did not alter the
active site ionization pattern of sdh qualitatively.
