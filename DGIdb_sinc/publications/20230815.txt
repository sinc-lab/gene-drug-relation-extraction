a b s t r a c t
scopolamine (hyoscine) is commonly used as an anticholinergic drug to relieve nausea, vomiting and dizziness of
a  xxxd1892xxx  as well as recovery from anesthesia and surgery. sucrase as a hydrolytic enzyme breaks down
sucrose into its monomers, glucose and fructose. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of scopolamine
on the activity and the structural changes of yeast sucrase. the results showed that binding of scopolamine to
sucrase could inhibit the enzyme activity. a non-competitive inhibition was observed in different concentrations
of scopolamine (0.6 to 3.6 mm). the study by circular dichroism measurement in far-uv showed that the absolute
enzyme exhibited a ﬂat negative trough, indicating the presence of alpha-helices and beta-sheet structures in the
enzyme. binding of the inhibitor on the enzyme made a deeper trough at 218 nm, suggesting the increasing of betasheet content of the enzyme. fluorescence measurement showed that binding of scopolamine to free enzyme and
enzyme–substrate complex increased the peak intensity at 350 nm and also induced red shift. our ﬁndings
suggest that scopolamine binds to the location other than the active site of enzyme and that the binding causes
structural changes and inhibits the enzyme activity.

1. introduction
scopolamine (hyoscine) is an alkaloid drug obtained from plants of
the nightshade family (solanaceae). it is an anticholinergic agent which
acts as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites
of the parasympathetic nervous system. scopolamine is widely used in
adults to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with  xxxd1892xxx  as
well as recovery from anesthesia and surgery. sucrase (invertase) is a
hydrolytic enzyme that breaks down sucrose to its monomers, glucose
and fructose. sucrase has various isoforms in plants (unger et al., 1994),
and yeast (carlson and botstein, 1982). the structure and function of
sucrase in plants were well investigated (sturm, 1999). acid invertases
have been puriﬁed in some plants, the activity of enzyme was inhibited by
heavy metals such as hg and ag suggesting that the active site of enzyme
has sulfhydryl group. in contrast, alkaline invertase is not inhibited by
heavy metals. the human gastrointestinal system has a type of sucrase
known as sucrase- xxxg2070xxx  that resides in the apical surface of intestinal
cells. intestinal sucrase- xxxg2070xxx  is a single gene product (alpers et al.,
1986; semenza, 1986), which undergoes n-glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum, and is further processed in golgi to a glycosylated form
(semenza, 1986). following the insertion into the brush border
membrane, sucrase- xxxg2070xxx  is cleaved by pancreatic proteases to

yield two separate enzymes, the remaining  xxxg2070xxx  anchored to the
membrane by its nh2-terminal domain and the remaining sucrase is
attached to  xxxg2070xxx  by strong ionic interactions (naim et al., 1988;
semenza, 1986). congenital sucrase- xxxg2070xxx  deﬁciency (csid) is an
inherited metabolic disease characterized by a complete or almost
complete lack of sucrase and a deﬁciency of  xxxg2070xxx  activity. the
deﬁciency of sucrase activity can be treated by replacing the missing
enzyme by yeast sucrase. patients are able to consume a normal sucrosecontaining diet without experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms.
the structure of yeast sucrase has been studied (gascon et al., 1968;
reddy and maley, 1996) and showed that three acidic amino acids play
important role in its active site (gascon et al., 1968; pons et al. 2004). it
has been shown that most of the secondary structure of the enzyme
consists of beta-sheets and in the form of beta-propeller.
in this work, the effect of scopolamine on the activity of the yeast
sucrase was investigated and the structural changes caused by the
binding of scopolamine to enzyme were studied.
2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals
yeast sucrase (3.2.1.26) and scopolamine hbr were obtained from
fluka company. all the chemicals used for the enzyme assay and
buffer preparation were reagent grade and obtained from the merck
company.

2.2. enzyme activity
enzyme activity was measured according to the method reported
by minai-tehrani et al. (2009). sucrase solution (0.5 mg/ml) was
prepared by dissolving the enzyme in distilled water. the optimum
ph for enzyme activity was determined to be 4.5, however the
enzyme is more stable in ph 7 (gascon et al., 1968), and on the other
hand, scopolamine has been reported to be unstable in acidic or basic
solutions (wu et al., 1998), therefore, the enzyme assay was
performed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at ph 7. to determine the
enzyme activity in the physiological condition of the small intestine
lumen (the ph of duodenum is usually between 7 and 8), the enzyme
kinetics was also measured at ph 8 and 37 °c.
the reaction was started by adding 100 µl of sucrase solution to the
test tubes containing different concentrations of sucrose (2.5–75 mm).
for the assays done in the presence of scopolamine, appropriate
amounts of scopolamine were added to the test tubes from the stock
solution (50 mm) which was prepared by dissolving scopolamine in
distilled water. the ﬁnal volume in each test tube was always 2 ml and
the concentration of scopolamine varied from 0.6 to 3.6 mm.
sucrose hydrolyzing activity of sucrase was determined by
measuring the rate of liberation of glucose and fructose from sucrose.
the enzyme was incubated with sucrose for 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and
30 min in both the presence and absence of scopolamine. the
enzyme's activity was stopped at the mentioned times by adding
1 ml alkaline solution of somogyi–nelson reagent to the test tubes.
the colorimetric of somogyi–nelson method was performed for the
enzyme activity (robyt and white, 1987; yanase et al., 1995) using
perkin-elmer visible spectrophotometer.
the results were the average of at least three separate experiments
and were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
2.3. circular dichroism measurements
circular dichroism was recorded at the constant temperature of
25 °c by using aviv 215 instrument equipped with an element for
temperature control. the spectra in the far-uv region were collected in
the range 190–260 nm, and points were taken in 1 nm intervals. the
enzyme solution was prepared with the concentration of 0.04 mg/ml in
0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7). sucrose was used with ﬁxed 0.06 mm
concentration and scopolamine concentrations were between 0.3 and
0.9 mm.

on the enzyme activity. the rate of reaction was determined at ph 7 and 8.

reciprocal of velocity (1/v) against the reciprocal of sucrose
concentrations (1/[s]) in the presence of different concentrations of
scopolamine. a non-competitive inhibition in sucrase was observed
after different concentrations of scopolamine were added to the
enzyme and substrate solution.
the km (11.5 mm) of enzyme was constant in the presence of
various concentrations of scopolamine (fig. 2), while its vmax
decreased by increasing of scopolamine concentration (fig. 3). the
concentration of scopolamine producing 50% inhibition of maximal
activity (ic50) was determined to be about 0.58 mm (fig. 3).
according to dixon plot, the inhibition constant (ki) of scopolamine
was determined to be 0.6 mm.
3.3. circular dichroism measurements
sds page was done to ensure the enzyme purity for the structural
studies. the results showed only a sharp band in the gel, conﬁrming
the purity of enzyme.
the circular dichroism spectra were recorded in far-uv between
190 and 260 nm. the pure enzyme exhibited a negative ﬂat trough
between 211 and 220 nm (fig. 4). the binding of scopolamine to pure
enzyme changed the ﬂat trough to make a deeper non-ﬂat trough at
218 nm. the binding of substrate to pure enzyme made the ﬂat trough
deeper and shifted it between 209 and 218 nm. the binding of
scopolamine to enzyme–substrate complex shifted the ﬂat trough to
make a non-ﬂat trough at 218 nm.
3.4. fluorescence measurements

2.4. fluorescence measurements
the ﬂuorescence spectra were taken by a cary eclipse ﬂuorometer.
the excitation wavelength was at 295 nm and the emission spectra
were recorded between 300 and 500 nm. the concentrations of
enzyme, substrate and scopolamine were the same as those used in
the circular dichroism experiment.

the excitation was done at 295 nm for exciting tryptophan
residues. fig. 5 shows the emission spectra for tryptophan residues.
the pure enzyme showed low emission intensity with a peak at
340 nm. the binding of the enzyme to either substrate or scopolamine

3. results
3.1. inhibition of sucrase activity by scopolamine
the reaction rate of enzyme on sucrose (substrate) was determined in the absence or presence of scopolamine by monitoring the
formation of products (glucose and fructose) at 530 nm. the
incubation of enzyme with sucrose continued to reach a steady
state (30 min). the michaelis–menten analysis was used to determine
the reaction rate of the pure enzyme. the maximum velocity of the
enzyme decreased by about 20% at ph 8, 37 °c, as compared to the ph
7 at the room temperature (25–28 °c), while the km was always
constant (fig. 1). since sucrase and scopolamine are more stable in ph
7, further kinetics experiments were done at ph 7. lineweaver–burk
plot was used to determine the kind of inhibition. fig. 2 shows the

increased the emission intensity, which was accompanied by a red
shift from 340 to 350 nm. the binding of scopolamine to enzyme–
substrate complex also increased the peak height (fig. 5).
4. discussion
the present study aimed at investigating the effect of scopolamine
on the yeast sucrase activity and its structural changes. the yeast sucrase
has been proposed to use in the human intestine in the patients with
congenital sucrase- xxxg2070xxx  deﬁciency (treem et al. 1993). sacrosidase (a liquid produced from s. cerevisiae) is used in these patients to
decrease the effect of lacking of sucrase (treem et al. 1999).
since the stability of the enzyme and inhibitors is achieved at ph 7,
most of the enzyme kinetics and structural changes were performed
at this ph. however, the sucrase kinetics was also measured in the
physiologic condition of the small intestine (ph 8 and 37 °c) by
michaelis–menten plot. our results showed approximately 20%
reduction in the enzyme activity in comparison with ph 7.
there are few reports about the effect of therapeutic drugs on
sucrase activity. codeine was one of the ﬁrst common drugs that have
been reported to inhibit the yeast sucrase activity (minai-tehrani et al.,
2009). some drugs such as  xxxd2193xxx  increases rat intestinal sucrase
activity (farooq et al., 2007), whereas non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (nsaids) decrease intestinal sucrase activity (chopra et al., 2007).
the ﬁnding of this study revealed that scopolamine could inhibit
sucrase activity by non-competitive inhibition. some drugs such as

codeine and castanospermine also inhibit sucrase via a noncompetitive inhibition in yeast sucrase and the human enterocytelike cell line caco-2, respectively (minai-tehrani et al., 2009; trugnan
et al., 1986), whereas some others such as nojirimycin, eoxynojirimycin and acarbose have shown competitive inhibition of intestinal
sucrase (hanozet et al., 1981). previous reports have indicated that
acidic amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate play the main role
in the active site of yeast sucrase (reddy and maley 1990).
non-competitive inhibition of sucrase by scopolamine suggests
that the inhibitor may bind to the inhibition site, instead of enzyme
active site. as a result, the inhibitor can bind to both free enzyme and
enzyme–substrate complex. to conﬁrm the above hypothesis, the
structural changes of sucrase were detected by circular dichroism and
ﬂuorescence measurements. the spectra obtained from the circular
dichroism showed a ﬂat trough for pure enzyme, which may indicate
the presence of alpha-helix and beta-sheets structures in the enzyme.
binding of substrate to the pure enzyme made the ﬂat trough deeper
accompanied by a blue shift suggesting the changes in the content of
the enzyme alpha-helices or beta-sheets. binding of the inhibitor to free
enzyme or enzyme–substrate complex changed the ﬂat trough into a
non-ﬂat trough at 218 nm, which suggests the disappearance of alphahelices and increasing of the beta-sheets content of enzyme. these
ﬁndings show that both the inhibitor and the substrate could bind to
enzyme, leading to some changes in the content of the secondary
structures of enzyme. a previous report has shown the presence of betasheets in the form of beta-propeller in the structure of sucrase (pons et al.
2004). in sucrase, the majority of secondary structures are in the form
of beta-sheets and alpha-helices are only formed in the short sequences
(alberto et al. 2006). the results of ﬂuorescence measurements also
showed that there were structural changes after binding of the
enzyme to substrate or inhibitor. the binding of the enzyme to the
substrate or inhibitor increased the emission intensity of tryptophan
residues, which suggests that such a binding could displace some
tryptophan residues from the exterior to the interior of the enzyme
and also to the non-polar medium. binding of scopolamine to the
enzyme–substrate complex also increased the emission intensity of
tryptophan residues, indicating that the inhibitor could also bind to
the enzyme–substrate complex.
determination of the amino acids composition of yeast sucrase
indicated the presence of 30 tryptophan and 31 tyrosine residues in
the enzyme (gascon et al., 1968; taussig and carlson, 1983).
in conclusion, our ﬁnding proposed that scopolamine would bind
to both free enzyme and enzyme–substrate complex. the noncompetitive pattern of inhibition and the structural changes mentioned above imply that the inhibitor binds to the inhibition site and
reduces the rate of enzyme activity.
