jostling for position: optimizing linker location in the
design of  xxxg730xxx -targeting protacs

 xxxg730xxx -a (er) antagonists have been widely used
for breast cancer therapy. despite initial responsiveness, hormone-sensitive er-positive cancer cells eventually develop resistance to er antagonists. it has been shown that in most of
these resistant tumor cells, the er is expressed and continues
to regulate tumor growth. recent studies indicate that  xxxd3285xxx  initially acts as an antagonist, but later functions as an er
agonist, promoting tumor growth. this suggests that targeted
er degradation may provide an effective therapeutic approach
for breast cancers, even those that are resistant to conventional therapies. with this in mind, we previously demonstrated
that proteolysis targeting chimeras (protacs) effectively
induce degradation of the er as a proof-of-concept experiment. herein we further refined the protac approach to
target the er for degradation. the er-targeting protacs are

composed of an estradiol on one end and a hypoxia-inducing
factor 1a ( xxxg1048xxx )-derived synthetic pentapeptide on the other.
the pentapeptide is recognized by an e3 ubiquitin ligase
called the von hippel lindau tumor suppressor protein ( xxxg2415xxx ),
thereby recruiting the er to this e3 ligase for ubiquitination
and degradation. specifically, the pentapeptide is attached at
three different locations on estradiol to generate three different protac types. with the pentapeptide linked through the
c7a position of estradiol, the resulting protac shows the
most effective er degradation and highest affinity for the  xxxg730xxx . this result provides an opportunity to develop
a novel type of er antagonist that may overcome the resistance of breast tumors to conventional drugs such as  xxxd3285xxx 
and  xxxd2165xxx  ( xxxd2165xxx ).

introduction
breast cancer is the most common form of malignant disease
in women worldwide. the majority of breast tumors, about
two thirds of those initially diagnosed, are  xxxg730xxx -a
(er)-positive. in most cases the er plays a significant role in
the stimulation and growth of these breast tumors.[1, 2] for example, the protein level of the er is elevated in pre-malignant
and malignant breast lesions relative to normal tissue.[1] in addition, the clear correlation between er-positive breast tumors
and their response to anti-estrogen therapy has been demonstrated.[3]
most er-positive tumors initially respond well to anti-estrogens, which block the site at which estrogen can bind, thereby
halting the growth of cancer cells.  xxxd3285xxx , a non-steroid selective er modulator (serm), is an anti-estrogen therapeutic
which has been widely used for more than 20 years in all
stages of er-positive breast cancers.[4, 5] specifically,  xxxd3285xxx 
induces a conformational change of the er that blocks the receptor’s function.[6] another example is  xxxd2165xxx  ( xxxd2165xxx ),[7, 8] which is a pure steroidal anti-estrogen approved for
the treatment of post-menopausal women with hormone-sensitive, advanced, or metastatic breast cancers. like  xxxd3285xxx ,
 xxxd2165xxx  competitively binds the er and blocks er-promoted
cell proliferation. whereas  xxxd3285xxx  causes accumulation of
the er,  xxxd2165xxx , like er-targeting protac molecules, induces selective proteasome-mediated degradation of the er and
therefore does not exhibit the agonistic effects commonly associated with serms.[9] unfortunately, despite the relative

safety and significant anti-neoplastic activities of these anti-estrogens, most initially responsive breast tumors acquire resistance.[10–14] as such, the major challenge is to develop novel
therapeutic agents that not only inhibit the growth of hormone-sensitive breast tumors, but also prevent the development of drug resistance.
although the mechanism by which er-positive cancer cells
acquire drug resistance is not clearly understood, it is unlikely
that any single mechanism or gene confers anti-estrogen resistance. given that less than 25 % of tumors which recur following treatment with  xxxd2165xxx  or  xxxd3285xxx  lack the
er,[15, 16] er loss does not seem to be the major mechanism
that drives acquired resistance. it has also been shown that a
loss of anti-estrogen responsiveness by initially sensitive
tumors is unlikely due to mutations or deletion of the er
gene.[1, 14] in fact, most tumors at recurrence retain levels of er

expression that would define them as er positive.[17–21] in addition, the er appears to maintain the
ability to continuously regulate tumor growth in
most anti-estrogen-resistant tumors.[20] it has been
suggested that one likely cause of  xxxd3285xxx  resistance is the ability of tumors to switch from recognizing an anti-estrogen as an antagonist to recognizing
it as an agonist, perhaps through differential co-regulator recruitment to the er.[22–26] for  xxxd2165xxx , a
conformational change in the er is suggested to
affect the binding of co-regulator(s) and to influence
the stability of the er, thereby causing its rapid degradation. additionally,  xxxd2165xxx  causes a loss of the
er protein without affecting er mrna levels.[27, 28]
consistent with this observation, it has been reported
that resistance of human breast cancer cells to  xxxd2165xxx  is not associated with a general loss of er expression or lack of estrogen responsiveness.[29] taken
together, it seems that  xxxd3285xxx  and  xxxd2165xxx 
maintain their er binding affinity despite the loss of
their antiproliferative or er-antagonistic effects, and
that the er continues to regulate the growth of resistant er-positive breast cancer cells. consequently,

biological characterization of protacs
protacs 2, 2*, 13, 14, and 24 were tested for their ability to
degrade the endogenous er in mcf7 breast cancer cells. after
incubation with protacs for 48 h, their effects on er protein
levels were evaluated by western blotting analysis and immunofluorescence.
previous reports indicated that the o17-linked protac 2
would degrade the er in a proteasome-dependent
manner.[31, 32, 38] our initial data confirmed this finding (figure 2 a) while demonstrating that the c-terminal-protected
protac 2 is superior to the deprotected protac 2*. a major
drawback to these compounds is their susceptibility to endogenous esterases, so we moved forward with the testing of
carbon-based linkages to confirm the results from these proofof-concept protacs. a similar trend in er degradation was observed for the c16a-based protacs 13 and 14, with the protected pentapeptide providing superior degradation (figure 2 b). the c7a-based protac 24 showed a similar ability to

control, the attenuation of er signal (green) was observed with
the treatment of 13 and 24 (figure 3 a, top row). these compounds showed an accumulation of the green signal when cotreated with epoxomicin, which was also observed in control/
epoxomicin treated cells (figure 3 a, bottom row). this result
was confirmed by western blotting using 24 and e2 (figure 3 b). to validate the superior position for protac linkage, a
competitive ligand binding affinity assay was performed. these
in vitro data indicate that the c7a-based protac 24 has the
highest affinity of the e2-based protac compounds tested, superior even to  xxxd3285xxx . the binding data for the c16a-based
protacs 13 and 14 also support the data from figure 2 which
indicates that benzyl protection of the c terminus of the pentapeptide gives a superior compound. because a protac with
a higher binding affinity for the target protein should induce
optimal ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the
proteasome, further optimization of the protac approach for
the er should use the c7a linkage.

conclusions
the ubiquitin–proteasome degradation pathway is a destructive, irreversible process and controls many important biological processes such as cell-cycle progression, differentiation,
and inflammation. we have shown previously that the cellular
ubiquitination machinery can be hijacked by a protac containing a pentapeptide that is recognized by the e3 ligase
 xxxg2415xxx , and that a protac containing a ligand of a target protein induces ubiquitination and degradation of that protein in
living cells.[31, 38, 46] this “chemical knockout” approach provides
flexible spatial and temporal control, which is critical to dissect
complex signaling pathways in cells.
as many diseases are driven by the expression of a few proteins, a potential therapeutic strategy is to remove these essential proteins. small interfering rnas (sirnas), which knock
down the expression of a gene of interest by destroying its
mrnas, have drawn considerable attention as a potential therapeutic approach.[47, 48] however, this sirna knock-down strategy has some inherent problems,[47–49] such as off-target effects, sequence-independent effects, activation of unrelated
signaling pathways, and drug delivery. the protac approach
does not appear to suffer these same limitations and thus may

provide an additional strategy to treat diseases by destroying
disease-promoting proteins.
as er-positive breast cancers require er-promoted cell proliferation, the current therapeutic paradigm relies on the blockage of this hormone-mediated cell growth. thus, a strategy
which allows selective degradation of the er could provide a
valuable and novel therapeutic option for many breast cancer
patients. additionally, most breast cancers that develop resistance to current treatments retain functional ers. optimized
protacs, which induce the degradation of the er, may thus
provide an additional therapeutic option for the treatment of
 xxxd3285xxx - or  xxxd2165xxx -resistant breast tumors.
in summary, we have shown that a chimeric small molecule
induces the proteasome-dependent degradation of the er in
living cells. whether the targeted degradation of er is useful in
treating hormone-sensitive or anti-estrogen-resistant breast
tumors remains to be determined. generally, protacs should
be optimized by determining a position for derivatization that
retains a maximal binding affinity. additionally, pentapeptidebased protacs benefit from c-terminal protection of the peptide regardless of the linker position. finally, the small-molecule strategy reported herein presents a generic approach to
target any cancer-promoting protein for degradation.
