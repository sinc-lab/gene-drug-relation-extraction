comparison of the vasoconstrictor properties of the  xxxg1110xxx -receptor agonists  xxxd3135xxx  ( xxxd3135xxx ) and sumatriptan in human isolated coronary artery...   xxxd3135xxx  ( xxxd3135xxx ) is a novel  xxxg1110xxx -receptor agonist and is effective in the treatment of migraine headache. as angiographic studies have shown that the prototypic  xxxg1110xxx /1b-receptor agonist sumatriptan can cause coronary artery constriction in patients with mild coronary artery disease, we have compared the contractile effects of  xxxd3135xxx  on human isolated coronary artery with those of sumatriptan and 5-ht. two different experimental protocols were used. in study 1 (to avoid agonist desensitisation and interaction effects), arterial segments were exposed to a single agonist (either 5-ht, sumatriptan or  xxxd3135xxx ) and in study 2 each arterial segment was exposed to all three agonists with randomised first exposure to sumatriptan or  xxxd3135xxx . in both these studies the maximum contractions evoked by sumatriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  were found to be smaller than those evoked by 5-ht, and the maximum contraction evoked by  xxxd3135xxx  was significantly smaller than that for sumatriptan.
