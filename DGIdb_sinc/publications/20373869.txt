 xxxg765xxx  ( xxxg765xxx ) is a key enzyme involved in neoplastic lipogenesis.
overexpression of  xxxg765xxx  is common in many cancers, and accumulating evidence
suggests that it is a metabolic oncogene with an important role in tumor growth
and survival, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. early smallmolecule  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors such as  xxxd463xxx , c75 and orlistat have been shown to
induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines and to induce tumor growth delay
in several cancer xenograft models but their mechanism is still not well understood.
these molecules suffer from pharmacological limitations and weight loss as a
side effect that prevent their development as systemic drugs. several potent
inhibitors have recently been reported that may help to unravel and exploit the
full potential of  xxxg765xxx  as a target for cancer therapy in the near future. furthermore,
novel sources of  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors, such as green tea and dietary soy, make both
dietary manipulation and chemoprevention potential alternative modes of
therapy in the future.

 xxxg765xxx  ( xxxg765xxx ) is a key bio­synthetic
enzyme involved in lipogenesis and the production of long-chain  xxxd2154xxx  from acetylcoenzyme a (coa) and malonyl-coa. uptake of
glucose into cancer cells leads to the production
of pyruvate via the glycolytic pathway. pyruvate
is utilized to produce atp via the krebs cycle
in the mitochondria; in turn, acetyl-coa, one
of the products, acts as a substrate for neoplastic
lipogenesis (figure 1) . normal cells (except liver
and adipose tissue) have low levels of expression
and activity of  xxxg765xxx , which is tightly regulated
by diet, hormones and growth factors (reviewed
in [1]). however, in rapidly proliferating cancer
cells,  xxxd2154xxx  can be synthesized de novo in
order to provide lipids for membrane formation and energy production via b-oxidation and
lipid modification of proteins. as such,  xxxg765xxx 
is highly expressed in many cancers, including
prostate, ovarian, breast, endometrial, thyroid,
colorectal, bladder, lung, thyroid, oral, tongue,
esophageal, hepatocellular, pancreatic and gastric carcinomas, as well as malignant melanoma,
mesothelioma, nephroblastoma and retino­
blastoma, soft tissue sarcoma (reviewed in [1–7]),
gastrointestinal stromal tumor [8] , paget’s disease of the vulva [9] and multiple myeloma [10] .
interestingly, increased  xxxg765xxx  expression has also
been observed in some benign and pre-invasive
lesions of prostate, breast, lung, stomach, colon
(aberrant crypt foci) and cutaneous nevi [2,11–14] .
elevated expression of  xxxg765xxx  has been
linked to poor prognosis and reduced diseasefree survival in many cancer types [15–19] . in

 xxxg765xxx  as a potential
therapeutic target in cancer

addition, several reports have demonstrated
that  xxxg765xxx  plays an important role in tumor
cell development and survival, with sirna
knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of
 xxxg765xxx  resulting in apoptosis of cancer cells and
prolonged survival of xenograft tumors [20–23] .
overexpression studies in immortalized nontransformed human prostate epithelial cells
and in transgenic mice have demonstrated
that  xxxg765xxx  is a bona fide oncogene in prostate
cancer [24] , and similarly in breast cancer, fatty
acid biosynthesis induces a cancer-like pheno­
type in noncancerous epithelial cells that is
dependent on  xxxg682xxx /her2 signaling [25] . a
potential mechanism of  xxxg765xxx  onco­g enicity
may involve cytoplasmic stabilization of
b-catenin with palmitoylation of wnt-1 and
subsequent activation of the wnt/b-catenin
pathway [26] . in this article, we focus on the
mechanisms of  xxxg765xxx  regulation in cancer and
discuss recent updates on the potential of  xxxg765xxx 
as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
regulation of  xxxg765xxx  in cancer

the regulation of  xxxg765xxx  expression in cancer
is complex and involves transcriptional and
post-translational control acting in concert
with several microenvironmental influences
(reviewed in [1,3,27] ; figur  xxxd2037xxx  ). growth factor
receptors, such as  xxxg682xxx -2 and egf receptor,

 xxxg765xxx  levels) [28] . similarly, aberrant activation
of akt and mapk can occur in hormonally
sensitive organs (breast, endometrium, ovary
and prostate) through activation of sex hormone receptors by estrogen, progesterone and
androgen. mutual crosstalk between upstream
regulators: growth factors, sex hormones and
their corresponding receptors, may also occur,
amplifying  xxxg765xxx  overexpression [27] .  xxxg765xxx , in
turn, may activate the  xxxg2198xxx  growth
factor receptor as evidenced in human breast
epithelial cells [25] , thereby setting up an autoregulatory loop. ultimately, both the akt and
mapk transduction pathways regulate  xxxg765xxx 
expression through the modulation of expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein
(srebp)-1c, which binds to regulatory elements
in the  xxxg765xxx  promoter. proto-oncogene fbi-1

interacts directly with srebp-1c through its
dna-binding domain to synergistically activate the transcription of  xxxg765xxx  (figure 2) [29] . this
is accomplished by acting on the proximal gc
box and sre/e box.
s14 is a lipogenesis-related nuclear protein that
is overexpressed in most breast cancers. a recent
study demonstrated that srebp-1c drives s14
gene expression in breast cancer cells, and progesterone magnifies that effect via an indirect
mechanism. this supports the prediction, based
on s14 gene amplification and overexpression in
breast tumors, that s14 augments breast cancer
cell growth and survival [30] . these effects are
mediated through  xxxg765xxx  expression. p53 transcription family proteins may also have a role
in regulating  xxxg765xxx  expression. d’erchia et al.
report that the  xxxg765xxx  gene is a conserved target
of the p53 family throughout evolution; cep-1,
the caenorhabditis elegans p53 homolog, is able
to bind the two p53 family responsive elements
identified in the worm  xxxg765xxx -1 gene. moreover,

by comparing wild-type and cep-1 knockout
worms, they demonstrated that  xxxg765xxx -1 expression
is modulated by cep-1 in vivo [31] .
overexpression and copy number gain of the
 xxxg765xxx  gene has been previously demonstrated in
prostate cancer and related to distinct molecular
signatures [16,32] . using immunohistochemistry
and fish ana­lysis in paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays, shah et al. observed gene copy
gain in 24% of all prostate adenocarcinoma
specimens examined, with concurrent increased
 xxxg765xxx  protein expression. these findings suggest
that  xxxg765xxx  gene copy number increases may be
involved in the resultant increase in  xxxg765xxx  protein expression observed and indicate that potentially alternate post-translational mechanisms of
 xxxg765xxx  regulation exist in cancer [32] . similarly,
future science group

ubiquitin-specific protease 2a (usp2a), a pre­
proteosomal deubinquinating enzyme, may interact with and stabilize  xxxg765xxx  through the removal
of ubiquitin [21] . usp2a is androgen regulated
and overexpressed in prostate cancer; its functional inactivation results in decreased  xxxg765xxx 
protein and enhanced apoptosis. thus, the isopeptidase usp2a plays a critical role in prostate
cancer cell survival through  xxxg765xxx  stabilization.
an alternate mechanism of regulation may occur
via mtor-mediated translational induction in
breast cancer cells overexpressing her2. yoon
et al. found that sk-br-3 and bt-474 breast
cancer cells that overexpress her2 also express
higher levels of  xxxg765xxx , compared with mcf-7
and mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells, in which
her2 expression is low. the induction of  xxxg765xxx

in bt-474 cells was not mediated by the activation of srebp-1c. exogenous her2 expression
in mda-mb-231 cells induced the expression
of  xxxg765xxx , and the her2-mediated increase in
 xxxg765xxx  was inhibited by both  xxxd2523xxx  (a pi3k
inhibitor) and rapamycin (a mtor inhibitor). in
addition, the activation of mtor by the overexpression of  xxxg1954xxx 
( xxxg1954xxx ) in mda-mb-231 cells increased the
synthetic rates of  xxxg765xxx . on the other hand,
 xxxg765xxx  was reduced in bt-474 cells by blockade
of the mtor signaling pathway [33] .
as stated earlier, microenvironmental stresses
also have a role to play in regulating  xxxg765xxx 
expression. oliveras-ferraros et al. found that
extracellular levels of  xxxg765xxx  are dependent on
the metabolic state of the cell, whereby ampk,
in response to increasing amp:atp ratios, leads
to extracellular  xxxg765xxx  release and a restoration
of the cellular energy state [34] . aminoimidazole
carboxamide ribonucleotide (aicar), an
ampk-activating drug, by stimulating an elevation of the amp:atp ratio in breast cancer cells,
leads to a dose- and time-dependent augmentation of extracellular  xxxg765xxx  levels. conversely,
sirna blockade of ampk attenuated the release
of  xxxg765xxx . furuta et al. demonstrated that  xxxg765xxx 
is significantly upregulated by hypoxia in human
breast cancer cell lines [35] . they also found that
hypoxia significantly upregulated srebp-1c
via phosphorylation of akt followed by activation of  xxxg1048xxx . moreover, results of reporter
assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation ana­
lysis indicate that srebp-1c is strongly bound
to the srebp-binding site/e-box sequence on
the  xxxg765xxx  promoter under hypoxia. in their
xenograft mouse model,  xxxg765xxx  was strongly
expressed in the hypoxic regions of the tumor.
in addition, immunohistochemical analyses of
human breast tumor specimens indicated that
the expressions of both  xxxg765xxx  and srebp-1c
were co-localized within hypoxic regions.
furthermore, they found that hypoxia-induced
chemoresistance to cyclophosphamide was partially blocked by a combination of  xxxg765xxx  inhibitor and cyclophosphamide, which has obvious
therapeutic implications [35] . separately, transient transfection studies performed using a
178-bp  xxxg765xxx  promoter fragment harboring a
complex srebp-binding site was used to demonstrate that extracellular acidosis may act in
an epigenetic fashion to induce changes in the
transcriptional activation of  xxxg765xxx  gene in breast
cancer cells [36] . interestingly, this stimulatory
effect is equally mimicked by well-characterized
oncogenic stimuli such as her2/neu [36] .

structure of  xxxg765xxx 

recently, the crystal structure and catalytically active sites of  xxxg765xxx  have been delineated.
 xxxg765xxx  is made up of a paired multifunctional
poly­peptide with seven catalytic domains that
include an acyl-carrier protein (acp). these
domains (in linear order from the carboxy terminus) are: thioesterase, acp, b-ketoacyl reductase, enoyl reductase, b-hydroxyacyl dehydra­
tase, acetyl/malonyl-coa transferase and
b-ketoacyl synthase. there are two additional
non­enzymatic domains: a pseudo­keto­reductase;
and a peripheral pseudomethyltransferase,
which is probably a remnant of an ancestral
methyltransferase domain maintained in some
related polyketide synthases [37] . initial work by
maier et al. resolved the 4.5-å crystal structure
of intact porcine  xxxg765xxx  [38] ; while, later, the
crystal structure of mammalian  xxxg765xxx  at 3.2-å
resolution, covering five catalytic domains, was
determined (however, the flexibly tethered terminal acp and thioesterase domains remain
unresolved) [37] . earlier work helped identify
the active sites and the inter-relationships of
the domain sites by biochemical methods [39–42] .
a significant step forward was the determination of the crystal structure of the thioesterase
domain from human  xxxg765xxx  in complex with
the orlistat ligand [43] . importantly, natural
product inhibitors of the ketoreductase domain
and small-molecule inhibitors of the b-ketoacyl
synthase and thioesterase domains have been
described as having anti-oncogenic properties.
 xxxg765xxx  as a potential drug target in
cancer therapy

 xxxg765xxx  is an attractive potential target for cancer therapy. as described in the previous sections,  xxxg765xxx  is selectively overexpressed
in many types of cancer, and these elevated levels have been linked to poor prognosis. rnai
knockdown experiments have shown that multiple cancer cell lines depend on  xxxg765xxx  for proliferation and survival. to date, several compounds
are known to inhibit  xxxg765xxx . these include  xxxd463xxx , c75, orlistat, c93 and naturally occurring
polyphenols. figure 3 outlines the structures of
reported  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors, and box 1 is a summary of all compounds that inhibit  xxxg765xxx  as
outlined in this article.
 xxxd463xxx  and c75, both early small-molecule
 xxxg765xxx  inhibitors, have demonstrated significant
antitumor activity.  xxxd463xxx  was isolated from
cephalosporium caerulens; it contains an epoxy
group that reacts with the ketoacyl synthase
domain of  xxxg765xxx  [44] . it was one of the first

cause profound effects on food intake and

loss seems to occur through the activation of
mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation via the

and, furthermore, through the inducement of
anorexia via the inhibition of production of
 xxxg1590xxx  within the hypothalamus [51,52] .
this effect has been proposed to be mediated by

several natural plant-derived polyphenols
have been shown to inhibit  xxxg765xxx , including
 xxxd2006xxx  (egcg) and the
flavonoids luteolin, taxifolin, kaempferol, quercetin and apigenin [55–57] . one of the best characterized polyphenol  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors is egcg,
a natural component of green tea. egcg is a
high micromolar time-dependent inhibitor of
 xxxg765xxx  ketoacyl reductase domain [58] . although
egcg is a promiscuous inhibitor targeting
multiple signaling pathways [59] , its apoptosisinducing effect seems to correlate with its activity at  xxxg765xxx  [60] . another compound, luteolin,
has the greatest effect on lipogenesis of the
polyphenols and inhibits  xxxg765xxx  directly. it has
structural homology to pi3k inhibitors and has
strong antioxidant activity [56] . recently, more
potent analogs of egcg have been developed
and have been shown to inhibit tumor growth
in a breast cancer xenograft model [61] .
orlistat is a us fda-approved pancreatic
lipase inhibitor, originally developed as an
anti-obesity drug, and is a potent inhibitor of
 xxxg765xxx . kridel et al. first identified orlistat in

growth inhibition in a xenograft prostate cancer
model [22] . orlistat is an irreversible inhibitor
forming a covalent adduct with the active serine of  xxxg765xxx  thio­esterase domain as shown in
a recently published co-crystal struc­t ure [43] .
in addition to the original report, orlistat has
shown modest anticancer activity in a few
in vivo models. inhibition of tumor  xxxg765xxx  activity by orlistat reduces prostate tumor growth in
mice xenografts and, at a high concentration,
reduces proliferation and promotes apoptosis
in the mouse metastatic melanoma cell line
b16-f10 (helping reduce the number of mediastinal lymph node metastases) and her2overexpressing breast cancer cell lines [22,62,63] .
further evidence indicates that orlistat can
accelerate tumor cell apoptosis in culture at high
concentrations and increase survival rates somewhat in gastric tumor-bearing mice in vivo [64] .
however, orlistat suffers from several limitations hampering its development as a systemic
drug: low cell permeability, low solubility, lack
of selecti­vity [65] , poor oral bioavailability and
poor metabolic stability [66] . several orlistat
analogs have been developed in an attempt to
improve on these limitations [67–70] .
c93 (or fas93), a synthetic  xxxg765xxx  inhibitor designed after the bacterial fabb inhibitor
thiolactomycin, was recently developed as part
of an effort to overcome c75’s lack of potency
and side effects [71] . c93 has shown some significant tumor growth delay in non-small-cell
lung cancer xenograft models and ovarian cancer xenograft models, as well as some chemopreventive effects in chemically induced lung
tumors [72–74] . importantly, c93 did not cause
anorexia and weight loss in treated animals [72] .
c247 belongs to the same class of compounds
as c93 and has also demonstrated efficacy in
a transgenic model of breast cancer with no
weight-loss side effects [49,71,75] . recently, the
team that developed fas93 reported a new
orally available  xxxg765xxx  inhibitor, fas31. fas31
showed tumor reduction in ovarian cancer xenograft models with no effect on bodyweight. in
preliminary toxicity studies, fas31 showed no
observable toxicity to normal tissues in the rat
or mouse [76] . unfortunately, c93, c247 and
fas31 structures have not been released yet.
as a testimony to the interest in  xxxg765xxx  as a
therapeutic target, several recent reports describe
new potent  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors identified through
high-throughput screening or medicinal chemistry programs. for example, a research group at
merck developed a series of 3-aryl-4-hydroxyquinolin-2(1h)-one derivatives while another
future science group

 xxxg765xxx  as a potential therapeutic target in cancer

research group at astrazeneca developed a
series of bisamide derivatives as  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors [77,201] . both groups obtained compounds
with activities in the low nanomolar range in
their respective  xxxg765xxx  biochemical assays but
did not report any data regarding cellular or
in vivo activity. the dibenzenesulfonamide urea
gsk837149a was identified as a low, nanomolar
 xxxg765xxx  inhibitor by high-throughput screening at
glaxosmithkline. biochemical studies showed
that gsk837149a is a reversible inhibitor of
the  xxxg765xxx  b-ketoacyl reductase domain, but its
poor cell permeability prevented the study of its
mechanism in cells [78] . a systematic screening
of 250,000 natural product extracts led to the
isolation of platensimycin as a potent inhibitor of
bacterial fabf/b with a broad-spectrum grampositive antibacterial activity [79] . platensimycin
has also been claimed to potently inhibit mammalian  xxxg765xxx  in a biochemical assay, but to our
knowledge, no studies in cancer cell lines have
been reported [202] .
mechanism of action of  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors

the mode of action of several small-molecule
 xxxg765xxx  inhibitors is not fully understood. their
study can be hampered by their lack of potency,
selectivity or cell permeability [48,59,65,78] .  xxxg765xxx 
inhibition initiates selective apoptosis of cancer
cells both in vivo and in vitro, which may involve
accumulation of toxic intermediary metabolite
malonyl-coa with reduction of both membrane
synthesis and phospholipid function leading
to both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects [23,80] .
indeed, recent evidence suggests that malonylcoa decarboxylase inhibition may be a potential
novel target for cancer treatment [81] . inhibition
of  xxxg765xxx  has been shown to induce endoplasmic
reticulum stress in tumor cells [82] , and a further
mechanism of action may involve cooperation
with endoplasmic reticulum stress inducers to
enhance apoptosis [83] . in addition, ceramide
accumulation following sirna inhibition of
 xxxg765xxx  may have cytotoxic effects leading to
tumor cell death in breast cancer cells (which
can be rescued with inhibition of ceramide synthesis) [84] . focusing on specific compounds,
 xxxd463xxx  has been shown to interfere with
dna replication and both p53 accumulation
and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis appear to
have important roles in tumor-cell death [85–87] .
c75 has similar effects with rapid malonyl-coa
and p53 accumulation. similarly, in a subset of
papillary thyroid carcinomas,  xxxg765xxx  inhibition
with c75 induces growth arrest and promotes
apoptosis via activation of the mitochondrial

arm of the apoptotic pathway with subsequent
activation of the caspase cascade [88] . orlistat
appears to have cell cycle effects, inducing g1/s
arrest, leads to dysregulation of skp2 with resultant  xxxg419xxx  accumulation and activation of
the retinoblastoma pathway [89] . furthermore,
it prevents endothelial cell proliferation and
importantly inhibits human neovascularization
in ex vivo assays, suggesting it maybe useful as an
antiangiogenic drug. these effects are mediated
through prevention of vegf receptor appearance on the endothelial cell surface [90] . knowles
et al. have shown that inhibition of  xxxg765xxx , by
either knockdown with sirna or inhibition
with the small-molecule drug orlistat, leads to
activation of the receptor-mediated apoptotic
cascade ( xxxg342xxx -mediated) and ultimately to
cell death. the unique apoptotic effect of  xxxg765xxx 
inhibition results from negative regulation of the
mtor pathway via stress response gene ddit4
(dna damage-inducible transcript 4) [91] .
several oncogenic signaling pathways are
affected by  xxxg765xxx  inhibition.
recent evidence suggests interaction between
 xxxg765xxx  and  xxxg682xxx  systems in ovarian cancer cells
and that interference with  xxxg765xxx  and  xxxg682xxx 
abrogates their oncogenicity [92] . furthermore,
c75 reduces her2 expression in breast cancer
cells [93] . this has the potential to be exploited
therapeutically both in breast and ovarian cancer treatment, whereby  xxxg765xxx  inhibition with
c75 can sensitize tumor cells against anti- xxxg682xxx 
drugs (e.g., pelintinib,  xxxd421xxx ,  xxxd2029xxx ,
cetuximab, matuzumab and trastuzumab). it
seems that akt is crucial for  xxxg682xxx / xxxg765xxx  interaction, and several studies indicate a connection
between  xxxg765xxx  inhibition and the pi3k pathway. high-level expression of  xxxg765xxx  in prostate
cancer is linked to activation and nuclear localization of akt and pi3k inhibition synergizes
with  xxxg765xxx  sirna to induce prostate tumor cell
apoptosis [28,94] . furthermore, positive-feedback
regulation between akt activation and  xxxg765xxx 
expression in ovarian cancer cells has been
demonstrated and, indeed, inhibition of the
pi3k/akt pathway sensitizes breast cancer cells
to  xxxd463xxx -induced cell death [95,96] . similarly,
the mode of action of c93 potentially may be
mediated through the akt signaling pathway
or through ampk [73,74] . incidentally,  xxxg765xxx 
inhibition drives the synthesis of phospholipid

 xxxg765xxx  & multidrug resistance

multidrug resistance is a significant problem in
cancer chemotherapy and, importantly,  xxxg765xxx 
overexpression seems to be a recently identified
mechanism of multidrug resistance in cancer.
liu et al. identified that ectopic overexpression
of  xxxg765xxx  induced drug resistance in breast cancer cell lines mcf7 and mda-mb-468; use
of orlistat sensitized these cells to anticancer
therapy. the proposed mechanism is  xxxg765xxx 
overexpression may lead to a decrease in druginduced apoptosis due to an overproduction of
 xxxd2833xxx  [98] . this phenomenon of fasninduced drug resistance may be exploited therapeutically through the use of  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors
solely or in combination with other chemo­
therapeutic agents. for example,  xxxg765xxx  blockade can induce a synergistic chemosensitization
of breast cancer cells to microtubule-interfering
agents, such as docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine. furthermore,  xxxd463xxx  and 5-fluorouracil display a schedule-dependent synergistic
inter­action, leading to an enhancement of the
efficacy of antimetabolite treatment in breast
carcinoma cells [99] . indeed, pharmacological
blockade of  xxxg765xxx  reverses autoresistance to
trastuzumab by transcriptionally inhibiting
her2 ‘super­e xpression’ occurring in highdose trastuzumab-conditioned skbr3/tzb100
breast cancer cells [100] . interestingly, disruption
of crosstalk between the fatty acid synthesis and
proteasome pathways in prostate cancer cell
lines can enhance unfolded protein response
signaling and cell death [101] .  xxxg765xxx  inhibition
may also have an anti-angiogenic role, as orlistat has been found to suppress endothelial cell
proliferation in vivo [90] .
conclusion

 xxxg765xxx  appears to play a key role
in tumor initiation and propagation for many
malignancies and, as such, represents an attractive target for cancer treatment. further improvements in developing and identifying novel  xxxg765xxx 
inhibitors, as well as identifying the patients who
may benefit most from them, will potentially
offer more effective treatment strategies.
future perspective

over the last 15 years,  xxxg765xxx  has emerged as
an attractive target for cancer therapy. early
small-molecule  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors like  xxxd463xxx , c75 and orlistat have been shown to
induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines
and tumor-growth delay in several cancer xenograft models but their mechanism is still not
558

future oncol. (2010) 6(4)

well understood. these molecules suffer from
selectivity, metabolic and pharmacologic limitations that hamper their use in preclinical and
clinical settings. several new potent inhibitors
recently reported in the scientific and patent
literature testify to the activity in the field and
may help unravel and exploit the full potential
of  xxxg765xxx  as a target for cancer therapy in the
near future.
overexpression of  xxxg765xxx  in many pre­invasive
lesions indicates the potential utility of  xxxg765xxx 
inhibitors for chemo­p revention [12–14,102] .
dietary manipulation may become a real possibility: green  xxxd2006xxx  inhibits  xxxg765xxx  without stimulating crossactivation of fatty acid
oxidation and inducing weight loss [103,104] .
in addition, xiao et al. found that dietary soy
protein inhibits dna damage and cell survival
of colon epithelial cells through attenuated
expression of  xxxg765xxx  and decreasing circulating insulin levels [105] . the anti-oncogenic
effects of the main olive oil mono­u nsaturated
fatty acid  xxxd2777xxx  (18:1n-9) which is found
in the mediterranean diet has also been demonstrated [106] . oleic-acid treatment efficiently
blocks  xxxg765xxx  activity and down­regulates protein expression, which directly leads to an
accumulation of  xxxg765xxx  substrate malonyl-coa
suppressing her2 expression.
moving forward, if sufficiently tolerable
 xxxg765xxx  inhibitors become widely available, further work will be needed to identify patients
in whom  xxxg765xxx  inhibition is most likely to
be beneficial so that they can be selected for
 xxxg765xxx  inhibitor trials. recent work from epidemiological studies suggests an interaction
between obesity and the impact of  xxxg765xxx ,
such that  xxxg765xxx ’s deleterious effects on survival seem to be most pronounced in obese
patients. specifically, ogino et al. observed
that increased  xxxg765xxx  expression in colon cancer tumors was associated with increased mortality in those with a high bmi but not those
with a low bmi [15] . similarly, unpublished data
from the physician’s health study and health
professionals follow-up study suggest that
increased  xxxg765xxx  expression in prostate cancer
tumors is associated with increased prostatecancer-specific mortality in men with a high
bmi but not those with a low bmi [nguyen et al.,
unpublished data] . taken together, this epidemiological evidence raises the possibility that men
who are obese and whose tumors express high
levels of  xxxg765xxx  may have the most to gain from
 xxxg765xxx  inhibition, and should be selected first for
 xxxg765xxx  inhibitor trials as they become available.

 xxxg765xxx  as a potential therapeutic target in cancer

review

executive summary
regulation of  xxxg765xxx  in cancer
n

the regulation of  xxxg765xxx  ( xxxg765xxx ) expression in cancer is complex. this may involve transcriptional control from growth
factors or steroid hormones and post-translational control from elements such as deubiquitinating enzymes. microenvironmental
factors such as hypoxia may also exert a regulatory influence.

over the last 15 years,  xxxg765xxx  has emerged as an attractive potential target for cancer therapy.
early small-molecule inhibitors of  xxxg765xxx  include  xxxd463xxx , c75 and orlistat.
the mode of action of these compounds is not entirely understood but may involve fatty acid depletion.
therapeutic use of these compounds has been limited due to their poor pharmacologic or pharmaceutical properties and to their effect
on feeding behavior.
recently developed  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors such as c93, fas31, 3-aryl-4-hydroxyquinolin-2(1h)-one derivatives or bisamide derivatives
reported herein may offer new opportunities to access  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors with greater efficacy and reduced side effects.
 xxxg765xxx  overexpression has a role in drug resistance, which can be exploited therapeutically with  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors.
novel sources of  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors, such as green tea and dietary soy, make both dietary manipulation and chemoprevention potential
alternative modes of therapy in the future.
obese patients whose tumors overexpress  xxxg765xxx  may have the most to gain from  xxxg765xxx  inhibition and could be ideal candidates for
 xxxg765xxx  trials as more tolerable compounds are made available.
