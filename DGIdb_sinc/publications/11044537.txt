abstract
objecti¨ es: to determine if a prophylactic dose of  xxxd1805xxx , 5000 iu daily, and if the adjusted-weight  xxxd1805xxx 
therapeutic dose of 100 iurkg twice daily are appropriate in pregnancy. method: anti-xa activity levels were used to
assess prophylactic ž33 women. and therapeutic ž15 women.  xxxd1805xxx  dosage throughout pregnancy. analysis of
variance was used and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. results: in the prophylactic
group, anti-xa activity levels did not vary significantly throughout pregnancy ž p s 0.15.. the initial  xxxd1805xxx  dose
was modified on the first anti-xa activity measurement in eight women, whose weight was statistically different from
those remaining on the initial dose ž p- 0.001.. the adjusted-weight therapeutic  xxxd1805xxx  dose induced adequate
anti-xa activity levels. conclusions:  xxxd1805xxx , 5000 iu daily, is suitable for most pregnant women and does not
need to be modified in the third trimester. a therapeutic  xxxd1805xxx  dose adjusted according to pregnancy weight is
appropriate. 䊚 2000 international federation of gynecology and obstetrics. all rights reserved.

safety are reported w1x. lmwhs have a longer
half-life, superior bioavailability ž90%., lower
binding to plasma proteins and endothelial cells,
less effects on platelet function, and a lower risk
of bleeding, thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis
than unfractionated heparin žuh. w1᎐3x. they
have a much more predictable dose-response relationship and can be administrated once a day.
all these parameters are advantageous in pregnancy, where high doses of uh are needed, espe-

cially in the third trimester w4,5x. data on lmwhs
in pregnancy are emerging w6᎐12x. they do not
cross the placenta and seem to be safe for the
mother and the fetus w7,8,13,14x. previous reports
suggest that higher prophylactic doses of  xxxd1805xxx  žfragmin 䊛 . or enoxaparin žlovenox 䊛 .
should be used in pregnancy, according to clinical
outcomes or anti-xa activity measurement w7,9,10x. recommendations on the need for increasing dosage through pregnancy are variable
w9,11,12x. there is little published data on the
therapeutic dose of lmwhs in pregnancy.
the present open study was conducted to explore the following questions, using anti-xa activity measurements: ž1. should the dose of  xxxd1805xxx , 5000 iu subcutaneously daily, be increased in the third trimester?; and ž2. is the
 xxxd1805xxx  therapeutic subcutaneous dose of 100
iurkg twice daily, adjusted to pregnancy weight,
appropriate?

2. method
all of the women included in this open study
required anticoagulation during pregnancy. they
were enrolled between february 1996 and january 1999 and were followed up on and delivered
at our center. all had a singleton pregnancy and
none had a previous history of heparin allergy.
the protocol was approved by the local ethics
committee. women were offered uh or  xxxd1805xxx  and except for particular cases žsuch as
uh resistance ., the choice was left to the woman
after an explanation of the potential advantages
and side effects.
for women with a prophylactic indication,  xxxd1805xxx  was started at 5000 iu subcutaneously
daily. the dose was not modified, except if anti-xa
activity was lower than 0.2 urml or greater than
0.4 urml, 4 h after injection w1,15x. women on a
therapeutic dose were treated with  xxxd1805xxx ,
100 iurkg subcutaneously twice daily, adjusted
to pregnancy weight žpreceded by intravenous
uh for 2᎐3 days in case of acute venous thromboembolism.. the dose was adjusted throughout
pregnancy according to weight. the aim was to

obtain anti-xa activity levels between 0.5 and 1.0
urml, 4 h after injection w1,15x.  xxxd234xxx 
ž80 mg. was used if indicated.
anti-xa activity was measured 1᎐2 weeks after
the beginning of  xxxd1805xxx  treatment and at 4week intervals thereafter. blood platelet levels
were monitored 4᎐10 days after the beginning of
the treatment and with anti-xa activity thereafter. for anti-xa activity assessment, blood
specimens were drawn into vacutainers žbecton
dickinson. containing buffered 3.2% sodium citrate and centrifuged within 2 h of collection. the
first centrifugation was done at 1000 = g for 10
min. the supernatant plasma was then centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000 = g for 10 min. platelet-poor
plasmas were snap frozen in ethanolrdry ice and
stored at y85⬚c for 1᎐7 days before being tested.
anti-xa activity was measured with an automated
coagulation analyzer, sta compact, using sta
rotachrom heparin kits, sta hepanorm
hbpmrlmwh for calibration and sta hbpmr
lmwh control ždiagnostica stago, asnieressur-seine, france. at two control levels. anti-xa
activity was reported as heparin concentration as
displayed by the automated instrument.
 xxxd1805xxx  was discontinued at 37 weeks of
pregnancy and replaced by uh twice daily to
permit epidural or spinal anesthesia promptly
during labor w16x. if induction of labor was needed,
heparin was stopped the day before the delivery
date and spinal anesthesia was permitted žprophylactic doses. or replaced by intravenous heparin uh žtherapeutic doses.. in case of premature labor, spinal anesthesia was not permitted in
the 12-h žprophylactic doses. or 24-h žtherapeutic
doses. periods following the last  xxxd1805xxx  injection. in the post-partum period, women received
 xxxd1805xxx  or uh until warfarin was effective.
data were analyzed with the use of spss software žversion 4.0, spss inc., chicago.. the statistics included one-way analysis of variance, analysis of variance for repeated measures, scheffe
pairwise comparisons to control for multiple testing, and correlation coefficient. continuous
parameters were expressed as mean " s.d. all
p-values were two-tailed, and values less than
0.05 were considered statistically significant.

3. results
a prophylactic dose of  xxxd1805xxx  was given to
36 women and a therapeutic dose to 15 women.
maternal characteristics and the length of therapy, according to anticoagulation indications, are
given in table 1. among women with thrombophilia, seven had previous venous thromboembolism and 17 poor obstetrical history. four
women with known hypercoagulability states were
given therapeutic doses of  xxxd1805xxx ; one with
antithrombin deficiency and three with factor v
leiden and  xxxg1850xxx  deficiency. obstetrical reasons included recurrent intrauterine death with
placental infarction or with severe gestational hypertension.
 xxxd1805xxx  was started before the 12th week of
pregnancy in eight women on a prophylactic dose
and in four on a therapeutic dose. eight women
were treated first with uh and then switched to
 xxxd1805xxx ; two because of uh resistance and two
because of uh-induced severe headache.
one voluntary interruption of pregnancy and
one spontaneous abortion occurred in the prophylactic group, both at 12 weeks gestation. one
fetus died at 21 weeks in a woman with antiphospholipid syndrome žaps. and five previous spontaneous abortions. the mother began  xxxd1805xxx 
ž5000 iu. at 18 weeks gestation when the fetus
was already growth retarded. there were no other

21

perinatal deaths, no placental abruptions and no
episodes of thromboembolism. gestational hypertension with proteinuria occurred in one woman
and three newborns had a birth weight between
the fifth and the tenth percentile, all in women
with aps.
thrombocytopenia and symptomatic bone fracture did not occur. none of the women stopped
 xxxd1805xxx  because of side effects. twelve women
complained of slight burning or bruising at the
injection sites. there were no cases of antenatal,
intrapartum or postpartum hemorrhages.
among the women with prophylactic indications, 127 anti-xa activity levels were measured
ž11 in the first trimester.. the  xxxd1805xxx  dose was
modified in eight women, all after the first anti-xa
activity measurement. six of them needed a lower
dose of  xxxd1805xxx , 4000 iu daily, until delivery.
in two other women, the  xxxd1805xxx  dose was
progressively increased to 9500 iu daily. women
who remained on  xxxd1805xxx  5000 iu, those who
needed a lower dose and those who required a
higher one were significantly different by analysis
of variance in term of pre-pregnancy weight ž p0.001., body mass index ž p- 0.001. and weight at
the first anti-xa measurement ž p- 0.001. žtable
2.. further analysis with a scheffe pairwise comparison revealed that women who needed a lower
dose had a lower weight and body mass index
than those who remained on 5000 iu. women

who required a higher dose had higher weights

need to be changed when the weight was between
60 and 90 kg. this corresponded to a ratio
doserweight of 53᎐75 iurkg. a statistically significant relationship between anti-xa activity and
weight was found throughout pregnancy ž r s

levels were not statistically different at five different periods of pregnancy žfig. 1., by analysis of
variance ž ps 0.15. and by analysis of variance for
repeated measures ž ps 0.27..
among the 15 women on the adjusted-weight

4. discussion
in this open study, which included women at

e. rey, g.e. ri¨ ard r international journal of gynecology & obstetrics 71 (2000) 19᎐24

various risks of thromboembolic events, we
observed that most pregnant women treated with
 xxxd1805xxx  5000 iu daily did not require a dose
modification. when it was necessary, the change
was made at the beginning of the treatment.
maternal weight seemed to be responsible for
this dose modification. the relationship between
weight and anti-xa activity has been previously
reported outside of pregnancy w17,18x. in pregnant women, although no clear relationship has
been previously established, some authors had
taken weight into account to determine the initial
dose of  xxxd1805xxx  w11,12x. our data have suggested that  xxxd1805xxx  5000 iu daily is suitable in
a ratio doserweight interval of 53᎐75 iurkg,
which roughly corresponds to previous reported
strategies w11,12x.
in contrast to other reports, we did not observe
a need to increase the  xxxd1805xxx  dose throughout
pregnancy to maintain anti-xa activity in the prophylactic range w8,11,12x. the dose which was
established after the first anti-xa activity assessment was maintained throughout pregnancy. a
decrease in anti-xa activity could have been expected, as the volume of distribution of  xxxd1805xxx 
is plasma volume and its major site of clearance is
the kidney w19x. pregnancy is associated with a
50% increase in blood volume and glomerular
filtration rate. the rise begins in the first trimester
and plateaus after the 30th week of pregnancy. it
is, therefore, possible that a difference in anti-xa
activity exists between the first and third
trimesters. we were unable to explore this possibility as six of the 11 measurements available in
the first trimester were in women of low body
weight. the importance of this parameter could
have masked the relationship between the period
of pregnancy and anti-xa activity level. however,
the lower dose of 4000 iu was maintained
throughout pregnancy. moreover, we were unable
to find any relationship between gestational age
and anti-xa activity. these observations were
noted previously by nelson-piercy et al. w10x who
did not increase enoxaparin dose in the second
half of pregnancy. the difference between our
results and some previous reports could be due to
the fact that we measured anti-xa activity 4 h
post-injection instead of 2, 12 or 24 h w7,11,20x. as

23

we did not perform a complete pharmacokinetic
study, our results cannot be applied to other
times of anti-xa assessment.
the stability of anti-xa activity throughout
pregnancy with  xxxd1805xxx  contrasts greatly with
what has been observed with unfractionated heparin. up to 10 000 iu twice a day of unfractionated heparin may be necessary to achieve prophylactic anti-xa activity levels, with a large interpatient variability w4,5x.
we observed that weight-adjusted therapeutic
doses in pregnancy did not induce higher than
expected anti-xa activity levels. to our knowledge,
this kind of data on the use of a therapeutic
dosage of  xxxd1805xxx  in pregnancy is the first to be
published. the difference between a dose calculated on pre-pregnancy weight and one adjusted
to pregnancy weight could be important in cases
of substantial weight gain during pregnancy. during the planning of this study, the once-daily
therapeutic  xxxd1805xxx  regimen was not implemented. we decided to continue with the twice-aday schedule until the end of the present study.
although no major side effects of  xxxd1805xxx 
therapy, such as thrombocytopenia or major
bleeding occurred, this report should not be considered as a safety study. neither should it be
considered as a proof of clinical efficacy, as the
number of women was small and the study was
not designed to answer these questions. our general experience was that  xxxd1805xxx  was very convenient for the patients, safe and simple to use.
after the first anti-xa activity assessments, we
observed that serial measurements were not necessary, except in some cases. in non-pregnant
patients no monitoring was necessary during
lmwh treatment w1,19x. in conjunction with previous data, including those on bone density w7,21x,
it seems to us that  xxxd1805xxx  should be considered as more than an alternative to unfractionated heparin.
