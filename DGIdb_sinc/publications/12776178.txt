effects of ligand and thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  isoforms on hepatic gene expression profiles of thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  knockout mice.  little is known about the overall patterns of thyroid hormone (th)-mediated gene regulation by the main th receptor (tr) isoforms, tr-alpha and tr-beta, in vivo. we used 48 complementary dna microarrays to examine hepatic gene expression profiles of wild-type and  xxxg2283xxx  and  xxxg2284xxx  knockout mice under different th conditions: no treatment, treatment with 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (t(3)), th-deprivation using  xxxd3036xxx  (ptu), and treatment with a combination of ptu and t(3). hierarchical clustering analyses showed that positively regulated genes fit into three main expression patterns. in addition, only a subpopulation of target genes repressed basal transcription in the absence of ligand. interestingly,  xxxg2283xxx  and  xxxg2284xxx  knockout mice showed similar gene expression patterns to wild-type mice, suggesting that these isoforms co-regulate most hepatic target genes. differences in the gene expression patterns of  xxxg2283xxx / xxxg2284xxx  double-knockout mice and th-deprived wild-type mice show that absence of receptor and of hormone can have different effects. this large-scale study of hormonal regulation reveals the functions of th and of tr isoforms in the regulation of gene expression patterns.
