abstract
elevated levels of src kinase expression have been found
in a variety of human epithelial cancers. most notably in
colon cancer, elevated src expression correlates with
malignant potential and is also associated with metastatic
disease.  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) is a novel, orally active,
multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that targets src family
kinases and is currently under clinical evaluation for the
treatment of solid tumors. however, the effects of
 xxxd1815xxx  on epithelial tumors are not fully understood.
we show that concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  that inhibit src
activity do not inhibit proliferation in 10 of 12 colon cancer
cells lines. however, inhibition of integrin-dependent
adhesion and migration by  xxxd1815xxx  correlated with
inhibition of src activity, suggesting that  xxxd1815xxx  may
have anti-invasive or anti-metastatic activity and antiproliferative activity in epithelial tumors. using phosphospecific antibodies, we show that inhibition of src activity
in colon cancer cell lines correlates with reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and  xxxg1904xxx  on
specific src-dependent phosphorylation sites. we have
validated the use of phospho-specific antibodies against
src tyr419 and  xxxg1904xxx  tyr118 as biomarkers of  xxxd1815xxx 
activity in vivo. colon carcinoma – bearing mice treated
with  xxxd1815xxx  showed a decrease in both phospho-src
tyr419 and phospho- xxxg1904xxx  tyr118 in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, which correlated with inhibition of src
activity in the colon tumors. thus, peripheral blood

src family kinases are involved in many aspects of tumor
cell behavior, such as proliferation, survival, angiogenesis,
adhesion, invasion, and metastasis (1 – 5). src expression is
frequently elevated in a number of epithelial tumors,
including colon, breast, pancreas, lung, and ovarian,
compared with the adjacent normal tissues (2, 3, 5). in
colon cancer, increased src expression is linked to
malignant potential with increases seen in premalignant
lesions and adenomas but with highest levels seen in
malignant polyps (6 – 8). however, further increases in src
expression are also seen in metastatic tissues, and activating mutations have been found in a small subset of
metastatic colon tumors, suggesting an additional role for
src in the metastatic progression of colon tumors (9 – 11).
more recently, increased src kinase activity in colon tumors
was identified as an independent indicator of poor clinical
prognosis in all stages of human colon cancer (12).
much interest has, therefore, evolved around the development of src kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer
(13, 14).  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) was identified as a highly
potent, atp-competitive inhibitor of src and abl kinases
with antiproliferative activity in both hematologic and solid
tumor cell lines (15). the presence of the philadelphia
chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia results in a
constitutively active bcr-abl kinase, which drives the
pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia, and the
successful use of the abl kinase inhibitor imatinib (gleevec)
in this disease has validated the use of  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.  xxxd1815xxx  can inhibit
the kinase activity of bcr-abl mutants found in chronic
myeloid leukemia patients with acquired resistance to
imatinib (16) and has promising activity in phase i/ii
clinical evaluation in patients with imatinib-resistant
chronic myeloid leukemia (17, 18).  xxxd1815xxx  also inhibits
src kinase activity in epithelial cell lines (19, 20) and is
currently in phase i trials for the treatment of solid tumors
(21). however, the potential effect of  xxxd1815xxx  in solid
tumors may be multiple as effects on migration and
invasion have been reported as well as inhibition of
proliferation (15, 19, 20), and it remains unclear which of
these mechanisms will become more relevant in the clinical
application of  xxxd1815xxx  in solid tumors of epithelial origin.
the introduction of molecularly targeted agents into the
clinic has led to a re-evaluation of clinical trial design as
many of these agents are not cytotoxic, and conventional

molecular cancer therapeutics

measures of reduction in tumor bulk and the use of
maximum tolerated dose based on toxicity do not apply.
this has brought to our attention the need for robust
biomarkers of the biological activity of these agents in
tumor cells to aid in establishing optimal therapeutic doses.
phospho-specific antibodies have provided useful reagents
for analysis of signaling pathways in clinical samples. for
example, in clinical trials of the  xxxg681xxx 
receptor inhibitor gefitinib, phospho-specific antibodies
raised against the activated  xxxg681xxx 
receptor and the downstream mitogen-activated protein
kinase were used to select optimal doses (22). as tumor
biopsies are not readily available for these pharmacodynamic studies, the use of validated markers in surrogate
tissues is often required.
in this study, we have identified autophosphorylation of
src on tyr419 and phosphorylation of  xxxg1904xxx  on tyr118 as
potential biomarkers of  xxxd1815xxx  activity in tumors and
show for the first time that inhibition of src kinase activity
in peripheral blood correlates with effects in epithelial
tumors. furthermore, we show that concentrations of
 xxxd1815xxx  that inhibit src activity have no effect on the
proliferation of 10 of 12 colon cancer cell lines but do inhibit
cell adhesion and migration, suggesting that in addition to
effects on tumor proliferation,  xxxd1815xxx  may also be useful
as an anti-invasive and anti-metastatic agent.

materials and methods
cell culture and drugtreatment
colon cancer cell lines and syf / cells were obtained
from the american type tissue collection (lgc promochem, teddington, united kingdom) except for be (a kind
gift from n. gibson, university of southern california, los
angeles, ca) and km12c (a kind gift from i. fidler,
university of texas m.d. anderson center, houston, tx).
 xxxd1815xxx  (bristol myers squibb, princeton, nj) was
prepared as a 20 mmol/l stock in dmso and diluted in
culture media before treatment for the indicated times.
cell proliferation assay
cells were plated at an appropriate density in 96-well
plates and after 24 hours were treated with a range of
 xxxd1815xxx  concentrations. a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide proliferation assay (23)
was carried out after a further 72 h. mean values were
calculated from quadruplicate wells and plotted on logdose response curves as the mean percentage of the
untreated controls. ic50 values were then calculated using
xlfit software. the highest concentration of dmso (drug
diluent) added to the cells had no effect on cell
proliferation.
western blot analysis
cells were washed and then lysed in 50 mmol/l tris (ph
7.6), 150 mmol/l  xxxd3213xxx , 1% triton x-100, 0.5%
 xxxd1835xxx , 0.1% sds, 10 ag/ml aprotinin, 125 mmol/l
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 amol/l sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5 mmol/l sodium fluoride. cleared
lysates were resolved by 4% to 12% bis-tris gel electro-

phoresis (invitrogen, paisley, united kingdom); proteins
were transferred to nitrocellulose then blocked and probed
with either 1:1,000 anti-src (cancer research uk), 1:10,000
anti- xxxg1904xxx , 1:1,000 anti – focal adhesion kinase (anti-fak;
both bd pharmingen, oxford, united kingdom), 1:1,000
anti – phospho-src tyr419, 1:1,000 anti – phospho- xxxg1904xxx 
tyr118 or 1:1,000 anti – phospho-fak tyr861 (all biosource,
nivelles, belgium). bound antibody was detected by
incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish
peroxidase – conjugated secondary antibody and visualized
by enhanced chemiluminescence (amersham, little chalfont, united kingdom). where indicated, the nitrocellulose
was incubated with re-blot plus (chemicon, chandlers
ford, united kingdom) to remove bound antibody then
reprobed with additional antibodies.
cell adhesion assay
black-walled, clear-bottomed, 96-well plates (corning
costar, high wycombe, united kingdom) were coated
with 1:250 dilution of matrigel (bd biosciences, oxford,
united kingdom) or 10 ag/ml poly-l-lysine (sigma,
dorset, united kingdom) for 1 h at 37jc and then washed
twice with pbs before use. cells were trypsinized, washed
with pbs, then incubated with calcein am (invitrogen) at a
concentration of 5 amol/l in normal growth medium f
 xxxd1815xxx  for 1 h at 37jc, with agitation every 15 min. cells
were then washed with pbs and resuspended in serumfree medium f  xxxd1815xxx . cells (2  105) were added to
each coated well of the 96-well plate and allowed to adhere
for 40 min at 37jc. the plate was then washed twice with
pbs, and fluorescence was measured at an excitation
wavelength of 494 nm and an emission wavelength of
517 nm. values represent the mean of quadruplicate wells
fse and corrected for background autofluorescence as
determined from coated wells containing serum-free
medium.
cell migration assay
cells were plated at 5  105 per well of a six-well plate in
dmem containing 10% fetal bovine serum. after 24 h,
confluent monolayers were scored with a fine pipette tip to
produce a denuded area or wound. migration into the
wound was monitored by time-lapse video microscopy
over 18 h in the presence or absence of  xxxd1815xxx  at 20
magnification on a zeiss axiovert s100 microscope using
aqm advance software (kinetic imaging, nottingham,
united kingdom). three representative areas were scored
for each treatment and the distance moved calculated using
tracking analysis software (kinetic imaging).
isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
human or mouse whole blood was collected into becton
dickinson vacutainer cell preparation tubes (bd biosciences, oxford, united kingdom) and centrifuged for 30 min
at 1,700  g. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc)
were removed from the resulting gradient and washed
twice with pbs for 15 min at 300  g. cells were then
washed in pbs for 5 min at 1,600 rpm and resuspended in
cell extraction buffer (biosource) supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail ii (both sigma) at a dilution of 1:100. lysis was

allowed to proceed for 30 min on ice, and then samples
were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,500 rpm at 4jc. cell
lysates were snap frozen on dry ice and stored at 80jc
until further processing.
in vivo analysis
km12c cells expressing activated src (src527f; ref. 24)
were injected s.c. into the right flank of 4- to 6-week-old
female  xxxg1724xxx  nude mice (charles rivers, harlan, united
kingdom). when the tumors were established, around 10
days after implantation,  xxxd1815xxx  was given by oral gavage
in 80 mmol/l citrate buffer, which was also used as vehicle
control. the mice were sacrificed 2 h later, and the tumors
were excised, and blood was collected from eight mice.
pbmcs were isolated as described above, and the tumors
from each mouse were formalin fixed and paraffin
embedded before immunohistochemical analysis using
dakocytomation envision kit (dakocytomation ltd., ely,
united kingdom). in brief, tumors were deparaffinized,
rehydrated, and labeled with 1:100 anti – phospho-src
tyr419 antibody (calbiochem, merck biosciences ltd.,
nottingham, united kingdom) or 1:100 anti – phosphopaxillin tyr118 (biosource) antibodies for 1 h.
tumor microarray analysis
the maxarray human colon carcinoma tissue microarray
(zymed, invitrogen) was used. each slide contains 60 tissue
cores from different colon carcinomas. they consist of 49
adenocarcinomas, 7 mucinous carcinomas, 3 signet ring
adenocarcinomas, and 1 adenosquamous carcinoma. the
slides were stained as described above with 1:100 anti –
phospho-src tyr419 or 1:250 anti – src 36d10 antibodies
(cell signaling, new england biolabs, hitchin, united
kingdom) for 18 h. expression was scored as staining
intensity using a three-point system and was carried out by
three independent assessors. only 7 of the 60 samples were
given different scores, and in these cases, the samples were
reassessed by each of the scorers, and a representative score
agreed.

results
inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by  xxxd1815xxx 
does not correlate with inhibition of src activity
inhibition of src activity has been reported to inhibit the
proliferation of some, but not all, tumor cell lines. we
looked at the ability of  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit proliferation in a
panel of 12 colon carcinoma cell lines. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays were
carried out after exposure to a range of  xxxd1815xxx  concentrations for 72 h, and ic50 values were calculated (table 1).
nine of the cell lines had ic50 values between 1 and
10 amol/l, with widr and ht29 cells being the most
sensitive with ic50 values of 0.03 and 0.05 amol/l, respectively, whereas sw620 cells were the most resistant with an
ic50 value of 16.41 amol/l. the sensitivity of the cell lines to
 xxxd1815xxx  did not correlate with src protein levels as all the
widr, ht29, and sw620 cells expressed equivalent levels
of src (fig. 1a). using src autophosphorylation on tyr419
as a measure of src activity in cells,  xxxd1815xxx  treatment

*ic50 values generated from 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide proliferation assays following exposure to  xxxd1815xxx  for
72 h (mean f sd from three separate experiments).

resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of src activity in all
cell lines analyzed (fig. 1b, shown here in sw620, ht29,
h630, and widr cells). inhibition of src activity correlated
with inhibition of proliferation in the widr and ht29 cells
but not in the sw620 or h630 cells where much higher
concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  were required to prevent
proliferation than was required for inhibition of src activity.
furthermore, complete inhibition of src activity was seen at
200 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  in sw620 cells over 72 h, which
corresponded to the treatment period of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide proliferation assays (fig. 1c). however, this concentration of  xxxd1815xxx 
had no effect on the proliferation of the sw620 cells. thus, the
ability of  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer
cell lines seems to be largely independent of its ability to
inhibit src kinase activity, although there are some cell lines
(e.g., widr and ht29) whose growth is inhibited by  xxxd1815xxx 
at concentrations that inhibit src kinase activity.
to further explore the ability of  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit cell
proliferation, experiments were carried out in fibroblasts
lacking all three ubiquitous src family members (syf /
cells; ref. 25). over 5 days, the growth of the syf / cells
was inhibited by around 45% in cells treated with 100
nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  (fig. 1d). as these cells lack src family
kinases, the effects of  xxxd1815xxx  on their proliferation cannot
be attributed to inhibition of src activity. it is likely
therefore that the ability of  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit other
kinases, such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor
and abl, may also contribute to its effects on cell
proliferation.
inhibition of cell adhesion and migration by  xxxd1815xxx 
correlates with inhibition of src activity
src is known to regulate cell-matrix adhesion and
migration of tumor cells. using two colon cancer cell lines,
we assessed the ability of  xxxd1815xxx  to block integrindependent adhesion to the reconstituted basement membrane matrigel. there was a dose-dependent inhibition of
ht29 and h630 cell adhesion to matrigel (fig. 2a), whereas
adhesion to the non-integrin ligand poly-l-lysine was not

inhibited by  xxxd1815xxx  at 200 nmol/l in either the ht29 or
h630 cells (fig. 2b). cell migration was also inhibited by
 xxxd1815xxx  treatment. there was a dose-dependent reduction
in migration in cells treated with  xxxd1815xxx , with 50 nmol/l
 xxxd1815xxx  resulting in around a 46% inhibition of migration

of  xxxd1815xxx  concentrations for 24 h (b) or treated with or without
200 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  for the indicated times (c) before preparation of cell
lysates. cell lysates were analyzed with anti – phospho-src tyr419
antibody (top ), and after removal of the anti – phospho-src antibody, the
blot was reprobed with an anti-src antibody (bottom ). d, syf / cells
were treated with a range of  xxxd1815xxx  concentrations, and cell counts
were carried out at the indicated times.

(fig. 2c). this was reversible as following removal of the
src kinase inhibitor from the culture media, the cells were
then able to migrate into the wound (fig. 2c, right, shown
for 100 nmol/l). inhibition of be cell migration was also
inhibited by  xxxd1815xxx  (results not shown). concentrations
of  xxxd1815xxx  that resulted in inhibition of cell adhesion and
migration correlated with a reduction in src activity as
measured by phosphorylation of src on tyr419 (fig. 1b).
expression and activity of src in human colon carcinomas
although src expression is elevated in a number of tumor
cell types, and in colon cancer has been shown to be
associated with tumor progression, there are no reports on
the use of antibodies against the autophosphorylation site
of src (tyr419) as markers of src activation in colon tumors
in situ. using a tumor array of 60 human colon carcinomas,
we found a range of src and phospho-src tyr419 expression
levels, with 84% of carcinomas having detectable levels of
autophosphorylated src and 92% having detectable src
levels (table 2). a three-point scoring system was used to
quantify the expression in each tumor, and representative
examples are shown in fig. 3 of the grades of phospho-src
tyr419 observed (fig. 3a – d). within tumors, all the cells
were uniformly stained, and the scoring represents the
intensity of staining rather than the percentage of cells
expressing the protein. a much stronger staining pattern
was seen with the phospho-src tyr419 antibody than the
antibody used to detect both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated src, making it difficult to quantify any
differences in the ratio of phosphorylated to total src levels
in individual tumors. however, in some cases, very low
levels of src expression (fig. 3i, +) was clearly associated
with high levels of phosphorylated src (fig. 3e, +++). in
well-differentiated tumors, src was found at cell-cell
boundaries (fig. 3f, g shows higher magnification image),
whereas a more diffuse cytoplasmic staining was seen in
invasive tumors where there was a lack of colonic crypt-like
structures (fig. 3h). very little src autophosphorylation
was seen in the mucinous carcinomas (table 2). thus,
autophosphorylation of src is readily detectable in a large
percentage of colon adenocarcinomas and may provide a
useful marker for inhibition of src activity in tumors.
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits fak and  xxxg1904xxx  phosphorylation
to further investigate the possible use of phosphospecific antibodies as biomarkers of src activity, we looked
at the ability of  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit src activity and the
phosphorylation of known src substrates in km12c and
ht29 cells. there was a dose-dependent inhibition of src
autophosphorylation, with concentrations of z50 nmol/l
resulting in complete loss of phosphorylation in both cell
lines (fig. 4a and b). there was a similar inhibition of fak
tyr861 and  xxxg1904xxx  tyr118 phosphorylation at equivalent
concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx . in contrast, much higher levels
of  xxxd1815xxx  were required to inhibit the autophosphorylation of fak on tyr397, with significant phosphorylation
remaining even in 100 nmol/l treated cells (fig. 4a), which
correlates with the inability of  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit fak
kinase activity (15).  xxxd1815xxx  can, therefore, discriminate

these phospho-specific antibodies may provide useful tools
to monitor src activity in tumors.

tion sites (results not shown).  xxxg1904xxx  was also highly
expressed in the human pbmcs, and its phosphorylation
on tyr118 was readily observed. phosphorylation of
 xxxg1904xxx  on tyr31, another src-dependent site, was not seen
(fig. 4b). autophosphorylation of src and phosphorylation
of  xxxg1904xxx  on tyr118 were chosen for further analysis.
ex vivo treatment of pbmcs with  xxxd1815xxx  resulted in a
down-regulation of both src autophosphorylation and
 xxxg1904xxx  tyr118 phosphorylation (fig. 4c).  xxxd1815xxx  treatment can, therefore, inhibit src activity in both colon
cancer cells and pbmcs.

inhibition of kinase activity intumors
to correlate inhibition of src in the blood stream with
phosphorylation events in tumors, km12c cells were
grown as s.c. tumors in mice. following treatment with
 xxxd1815xxx , phosphorylation of src and  xxxg1904xxx  in both the
pbmcs and tumors was measured. treatment with either
15 or 30 mg/kg  xxxd1815xxx  completely abolished src
autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of  xxxg1904xxx  on
tyr118 in pbmcs isolated 2 h after administration of the
drug (fig. 5a). no effects on src or  xxxg1904xxx  protein levels
were seen. immunohistochemical analysis of the colon
carcinoma xenografts showed strong staining for both
phospho-src tyr419 and phospho- xxxg1904xxx  tyr118 in the
vehicle-treated animals, which was completely abrogated
in the tumors taken from the  xxxd1815xxx -treated animals
(fig. 5b). thus, inhibition of src kinase activity in pbmcs
correlates with inhibition of src kinase activity in the
tumor itself. thus, pbmcs may be useful as a surrogate
tissue to evaluate the inhibition of src kinase activity by
 xxxd1815xxx  in solid tumors. furthermore, the doses of
 xxxd1815xxx  used were clinically relevant as they yield drug
exposures similar to those achievable in patients at
tolerated doses.

discussion
potential use of src inhibitors in solid tumors
although src expression and activity is commonly
observed in a number of epithelial tumors, including colon,
there is conflicting evidence on the role of src in the
proliferation of solid tumors. for example, overexpression
of constitutively active or kinase-defective mutants of src
did not alter colon or bladder tumor growth in vitro or

in vivo (26 – 28), whereas other studies have reported a
growth advantage upon overexpression of src in vivo (29)
and inhibition of proliferation in tumor cells in which src
expression was reduced using antisense (30). the
conflicting nature of these results relying on molecular
intervention has been confirmed by studies with smallmolecule inhibitors of src kinase activity. in the present
study, we showed that the growth of only 2 of the 12 colon
cancer cell lines was inhibited at concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx 
that correlated with inhibition of kinase activity. similarly,
in a panel of non – small cell lung cancer and head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma lines, the majority of the head and
neck tumors were insensitive to concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx 
that were required to inhibit src activity (19). these authors
went on to show that  xxxd1815xxx  induced a g1-s cell cycle
block associated with induction of p27 in the sensitive cell
lines, which has also been observed for other src kinase
inhibitors (19, 31). these effects on tumor cell proliferation
are not restricted to  xxxd1815xxx  as the inability of other src
kinase inhibitors to prevent proliferation of tumor cells at
concentrations that correlate with inhibition of src kinase
activity have also been reported (32 – 34). thus, only a small
subset of tumors may be dependent on src for proliferation
and, indeed, survival as both  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd1307xxx  have been
shown to induce apoptosis in certain cell lines (19, 35). the
involvement of src in growth factor – induced mitogenesis
has been known for many years (4), and the interaction of
src with growth factor receptors in tumor cells (35, 36)
suggests that src may cooperate with other signaling
pathways to drive proliferation of certain tumor types.
the ability of src kinase inhibitors to block proliferation
at relatively high micromolar concentrations most likely
represents inhibition of other target kinases, including
mitogenic growth factor receptors, at these concentrations
(15). this is supported by the inhibition of cell proliferation
at high nanomolar concentrations seen in the syf / cells,
which lack all src family members (fig. 1).
although the effects of src kinase inhibition on tumor cell
proliferation are wide ranging, one consistent finding is
that interference with src activity alters the invasive and
metastatic potential of tumor cells (20, 26, 33, 37, 38). we
show that the effects of  xxxd1815xxx  on tumor cell adhesion
and motility are seen at low nanomolar concentrations and
are independent of effects on cell proliferation. at these
concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx , not only was src kinase activity
inhibited, but phosphorylation of both fak and  xxxg1904xxx 
was also prevented. both src and fak are required for cell
motility, which has been linked to their ability to regulate
focal adhesion turnover (25, 39 – 41). upon integrin engagement, fak becomes phosphorylated on tyr397, creating a
high-affinity binding site for src, which then phosphorylates fak on specific tyrosine residues. the resulting
src/fak complex phosphorylates a number of other focal
adhesion proteins, including  xxxg1904xxx  on tyr118, and also
recruits a number of other signaling proteins to the
complex. this src-fak signaling complex has been shown
to control both cell motility and invasion (42 – 47), and the
src-dependent phosphorylation of fak is required for focal

adhesion turnover and changes in tumor cell behavior
associated with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(24, 28, 48).  xxxg1904xxx  phosphorylation is known to be src/
fak dependent (49) and has been implicated in the
motility of a number of different tumor types (50, 51).
the coordinate down-regulation of src, fak, and  xxxg1904xxx 
phosphorylation in  xxxd1815xxx -treated cells at concentrations
that prevent adhesion and motility coupled with the antiinvasive activity of  xxxd1815xxx  reported previously, and the
identification of elevated fak and  xxxg1904xxx  phosphorylation in highly metastatic cells (52), suggests that inhibition
of these signaling pathways provides an attractive mechanism to prevent invasive and metastatic spread of tumors.
in addition to effects on tumor proliferation,  xxxd1815xxx  may
therefore have more wide spread use as an anti-invasive
and anti-metastatic agent.
development of biomarkers for use in clinical
assessment of src kinase inhibitors
to aid the development of  xxxd1815xxx  as a treatment for
patients with solid tumors, it is necessary to develop
biomarkers of its activity, which can be used clinically to
assess both biological efficacy and to determine the optimal
therapeutic dose. autophosphorylation of src represents a
robust read-out of src activity (53), and we have shown that

it is readily detectable in 84% of human colon adenocarcinomas studied (table 1). furthermore, we saw inhibition of
src tyr419 phosphorylation in tumors taken from mice
receiving  xxxd1815xxx  at a dose of 15 mg/kg, which produces
systemic drug exposure (c max f 300 nmol/l and area
under the curve f 1.5 amol/l h) similar to those observed
in patients in the current phase i clinical trial in solid
tumors. our data also suggest that the phosphorylation of
fak and  xxxg1904xxx  are valid read-outs of  xxxd1815xxx  activity.
there is a considerable amount of evidence linking
aberrant expression of fak with malignant disease, with
elevated fak protein reported in an increasing list of
human epithelial cancers (54), which has been linked to
reduced survival (55, 56). however, little is known of the
phosphorylation status of fak and  xxxg1904xxx  in human
tumors, and this is currently being evaluated.
although we have shown that  xxxd1815xxx  can inhibit src
kinase activity in tumors in experimental animals, it is
likely that surrogate tissues will be required for pharmacodynamic studies in patients. peripheral blood provides a
readily available and abundant source of tissue, and our
analysis of src-dependent phosphorylation events in
human pbmcs showed that autophosphorylation of src
and phosphorylation of  xxxg1904xxx  on tyr118 provided

molecular cancer therapeutics

the identification of robust biomarkers for  xxxd1815xxx  in
solid tumors shown here is integral to the development of
this and other therapeutics that target src kinase. however,
a number of other key issues need to be addressed, such as
which patients will benefit from  xxxd1815xxx  treatment.
although overexpression of src in cell lines does not
predict sensitivity to src inhibitors, identification of
oncogenic pathway signatures using microarray analysis
in tumors may provide a useful approach to selecting
appropriate patients for therapy with targeted agents, such
as  xxxd1815xxx  (58). furthermore,  xxxd1815xxx  may also have
exciting activity as an anti-invasive and anti-metastatic
agent, which has yet to be addressed.

of other src substrates, including p120ctn and p130cas,
were also analyzed, but their phosphorylation levels were
not sufficiently high to obtain robust measurements of
inhibition upon  xxxd1815xxx  treatment.4 sensitive and quantitative elisas have now been developed to measure src
tyr419 and  xxxg1904xxx  tyr118 phosphorylation and are currently being used as part of the ongoing phase i evaluation
of  xxxd1815xxx  in solid tumors, where inhibition of src tyr419
phosphorylation in pbmcs correlates with  xxxd1815xxx 
plasma concentrations (21, 57). this will allow optimal
regimens of  xxxd1815xxx  to achieve both target inhibition and
tumor efficacy to be determined. this is particularly
important when tumors, such as the km12c cells used in
these experiments, do not require src activity for proliferation, but treatment may prevent further spread of the
tumor. in these cases, drug effects will not be measured by
reduction in tumor bulk, but the use of surrogate
biomarkers will allow confirmation that  xxxd1815xxx  is being
given at a biologically active dose.
