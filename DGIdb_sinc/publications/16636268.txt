the mitochondrion of trypanosoma brucei does not encode any
trnas. this deficiency is compensated for by the import of a small
fraction of nearly all of its cytosolic trnas. most trypanosomal
aminoacyl-trna synthetases are encoded by single-copy genes,
suggesting the use of the same enzyme in the cytosol and mitochondrion. however, the t. brucei genome contains two distinct
genes for eukaryotic  xxxg2425xxx  ( xxxg2425xxx ). rna
interference analysis established that both trprs1 and trprs2 are
essential for growth and required for cytosolic and mitochondrial
tryptophanyl-trna formation, respectively. decoding the mitochondrial tryptophan codon uga requires mitochondria-specific
c3 u rna editing in the anticodon of the imported trnatrp. in vitro
charging assays with recombinant  xxxg2425xxx  enzymes demonstrated
that the edited anticodon and the mitochondria-specific thiolation
of u33 in the imported trnatrp act as antideterminants for the
cytosolic trprs1. the existence of two  xxxg2425xxx  enzymes, therefore,
can be explained by the need for a mitochondrial synthetase with
extended substrate specificity to achieve aminoacylation of the
imported thiolated and edited trnatrp. thus, the notion that, in an
organism, all nuclear-encoded trnas assigned to a given amino
acid are charged by a single aminoacyl-trna synthetase, is not
universally valid.
genetic code 兩 mitochondria 兩 rna editing 兩 aminoacyl-trna synthetase

i

n animal and most fungal mitochondria, the total set of trnas
required for translation is encoded in the mitochondrial genome
and, therefore, of bacterial evolutionary origin. the aminoacyltrna synthetases (aarss) responsible for charging of mitochondrial trnas always are nuclear-encoded and, therefore, need to be
imported into mitochondria (1). however, their evolutionary origin,
just as the one of their substrate trnas, is in most cases bacterial.
thus eukaryotes, if we exclude all plastid-containing organisms,
generally have two sets of aarss, one for cytosolic and a second one
for mitochondrial aminoacyl-trna synthesis. in most eukaryotes,
however, there are a few aarss that are targeted to both the cytosol
and the mitochondria, indicating that the two sets of enzymes
overlap to a limited extent (2).
most mitochondrial genetic systems show deviations from the
universal genetic code. the most common one is a reassignment of
the termination codon uga to tryptophan (3). thus, to decode the
uga tryptophan codon, mitochondria require a nonstandard
trnatrp carrying a uca instead of cca anticodon. cytosolic
trnatrpcca is aminoacylated by a eukaryotic tryptophanyl-trna
synthetase ( xxxg2425xxx ) (4), whereas the mitochondrial-encoded
trnatrpuca is charged by a bacterial-type  xxxg2425xxx  (5). the cca
anticodon is a known identity element for both enzymes (6–8). it
is clear, however, that the bacterial-type enzyme in mitochondria
must be able to tolerate an uca anticodon (5).
in contrast to animals and most fungi, mitochondria from
protozoa and plants generally lack a variable number of mitochondrial trna genes. in these cases, the missing trnas are
replaced by import of a small fraction of the corresponding
nuclear-encoded cytosolic trnas (9). as a consequence, the
www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0602362103

imported trnas are always of a eukaryotic evolutionary origin.
an intriguing situation is found in trypanosomatids, e.g.,
trypanosoma brucei and leishmania spp., which have lost all
mitochondrial trna genes (10–12). their mitochondrial translation system therefore must function exclusively with imported
eukaryotic-type trnas.
trypanosomatid mitochondria use uga as tryptophan codon.
however, the only trnatrp gene in t. brucei is nuclear and carries
the standard tryptophan anticodon cca. recent work in leishmania revealed that trypanosomatids use rna editing to convert
the cca anticodon of ⬇40% of the imported trnatrp to uca; the
resulting trna now is able to recognize uga codons (13). besides
rna editing, the imported trnatrp is subjected to additional
mitochondria-specific modifications; most importantly, the thiolation of u33, the ‘‘universally unmodified’’ uridine in all known
trnas (14). trna editing is not required for thiolation of u33 but
it is possible that the modification is needed for editing. in any case,
the close proximity of the thiolated u33 to the anticodon suggests
that it influences decoding.
cytosolic and mitochondrial trnas of trypanosomatids originate from the same set of nuclear genes. therefore, it is
reasonable to assume that the same aarss are used in the cytosol
and in mitochondria. this assumption is supported by the fact
that in t. brucei, most aarss are represented by single genes only
(15). furthermore a dual localization in the cytosol and in
mitochondria has been shown for t. brucei glutaminyl-trna
synthetase and the  xxxg669xxx  (16). the imported trypanosomal trnatrp, however, represents a special
case, because its anticodon loop, due to the editing event and the
thiolation of u33, differs from its cytosolic counterpart (14).
this situation raises the question of how cytosolic and mitochondrial tryptophanyl-trna species are formed in t. brucei?
here we show that unlike most other trypanosomal trnas,
because of the mitochondrial use of uga as tryptophan codon,
cytosolic and mitochondrial aminoacylation of trnatrp requires
two distinct eukaryotic-type trprss.
results
the t. brucei genome encodes two eukaryotic trprss. in the genome

of saccharomyces cerevisiae, probably the best characterized eukaryote, we find annotated genes for 36 different aarss (www.
yeastgenome.org). these enzymes can be divided into 16 cytosolspecific ones, 14 of which are specific for mitochondria, and four are
known to be doubly targeted to the cytosol and the mitochondria
(these numbers are still, in part, based on predictions and, therefore,
represent approximations). it is striking to compare yeast with t.

brucei, whose genome encodes only 23 annotated aarss (15). this
low number makes sense because the trnas in the cytosol and
mitochondria derive from the same nuclear genes (10); it therefore
can be expected that the same aarss are used in both compartments. nevertheless, two distinct genes are found for aspartyltrna synthetase,  xxxg1225xxx , and  xxxg2425xxx . furthermore, in each case, one of the two proteins is predicted to have a
mitochondrial targeting sequence. it is not obvious why t. brucei
should have two aspartyl- or lysyl-trna synthetases, because the
corresponding cytosolic and mitochondrial substrate trnas derived from the same nuclear genes. however, the need for two
distinct trprss might be explained by the fact that because of
editing in the mitochondrion, cytosolic and mitochondrial trnatrp
differ in an anticodon nucleotide (13). in this study, we focus on the
functional analysis of tb-trprs1 and tb-trprs2, the two trypanosomal  xxxg2425xxx  homologues. the two proteins are 41% identical,
phylogenetic analysis shows that both are of the eukaryotic type,
and tb-trprs2 contains a predicted 50-aa mitochondrial presequence (fig. 1). tb-trprs1 shares 48–53% sequence identity to
eukaryotic trprss, whereas tb-trprs2 is more diverged, showing
an identity to other eukaryotic trprss of only 39–41%. interestingly, essentially the same situation is found in leishmania (17). the

two leishmanial proteins lm-trprs1 and lm-trprs2 are 76%
and 59% identical to their trypanosomal counterparts.
intracellular localization of tb-trprs1 and tb-trprs2. tb-trprs2 is

predicted to have a mitochondrial targeting signal. however, in
t. brucei, such predictions are difficult because mitochondrial
presequences can be very short (18). thus, to determine the
localization of the two enzymes, we prepared transgenic cell
lines, allowing inducible expression of tb-trprs1 and tbtrprs2 versions carrying the 10-aa-long ty1-peptide as epitope
tags at their carboxyl termini (19). immunofluorescence analysis
by using an anti ty1-antibody showed a tetracycline-inducible
diffuse staining of the tagged tb-trprs1, consistent with a
cytosolic localization (fig. 2a top and center). for tagged
tb-trprs2, on the other hand, a staining identical to the one
seen with the mitochondrial marker was obtained (fig. 2 a
bottom). furthermore, the two transgenic cell lines were subjected to a biochemical analysis that showed that the tagged
tb-trprs1 copurifies with the cytosolic marker, whereas the
tagged tb-trprs2 together with the mitochondrial marker is
recovered in the pellet (fig. 2b). these results are consistent
with the immunofluorescence analysis and show that the two
trprss have a nonoverlapping intracellular distribution: tbtrprs1 is exclusively cytosolic and tb-trprs2 is exclusively
mitochondrially localized.
rna interference (rnai)-mediated ablation of tb-trprs1 and tbtrprs2. to determine the function of tb-trprs1 and tb-trprs2,

we established two stable transgenic cell lines, which allow tetracharrière et al.

fraction only contains ⬇5% of mitochondrial rna and, thus, essentially represents cytosolic rna. days of induction (0 and 3) by tetracycline are indicated
at the bottom. the blots were probed for the t. brucei trnatrp as well as
trnaleu and trnatyr, which serve as controls not affected by the rnai. the
rna fractions were resolved on long acid urea gels, which allow separation of
aminoacylated from deacylated trnas. the bar graph shows the quantification of the results. relative amounts of aminoacylated trnas are indicated for
the trnatrp and the controls (trnaleu and trnatyr), respectively. for each lane,
the sum of aminoacylated and deacylated trna was set to 100%. (d) same as
c, but analysis was done for the tb-trprs2 rnai cell line.

 xxxd2900xxx -inducible ablation of each of the two enzymes. the northern blot insets in fig. 3 a and b show that induction of rnai in
these two cell lines leads to specific degradation of the corresponding tb- xxxg2425xxx  mrnas. most importantly, concomitant with the
depletion of the mrnas, a growth arrest is observed 2 (for
tb-trprs1) and 3 days (for tb-trprs2) after the addition of
tetracycline (fig. 3 a and b). thus, tb-trprs1 and tb-trprs2 are
both essential for growth of insect stage t. brucei.
to determine the biochemical phenotype of the two rnai cell
lines, we isolated total and mitochondrial rna from untreated
cells and from cells grown in the presence of tetracycline.
subsequently, the rnas were resolved on long acid urea polyacrylamide gels (20), followed by northern blot analysis, to
determine the ratio of uncharged trnatrp to tryptophanylcharrière et al.

trnastrp (fig. 3 c and d). the results in fig. 3c left show that
ablation of tb-trprs1 results in the accumulation of uncharged
cytosolic trnatrp. interestingly, in measurements of the levels
of tryptophanyl-trnatrp in the induced tb-trprs2 cell line, the
converse result was obtained, and a selective accumulation of
deacylated mitochondrial trnatrp was observed (fig. 3d right).
as expected, ablation of either  xxxg2425xxx  had no influence on the
aminoacylation levels of cytosolic trnaleu or mitochondrial
trnatyr. these results show that, in agreement with its exclusive
cytosolic localization, tb-trprs1 is responsible for aminoacylation of the cytosolic trnatrp. on the other hand tb-trprs2,
in line with its mitochondrial localization, is required for charging of imported mitochondrial trnatrp.
ablation of tb-trprs2 abolishes mitochondrial protein synthesis and, consequently, is expected to interfere with oxidative
phosphorylation (oxphos). mitochondria produce atp, by
oxphos and by substrate level phosphorylation linked to the
 xxxd1710xxx  cycle. we recently established an assay that allows
quantitation of both modes of atp production in isolated t.
brucei mitochondria (21, 22). to measure antimycin-sensitive
oxphos, mitochondria are incubated with adp and succinate.
␣-ketoglutarate is used in the determination of the antimycinresistant substrate level phosphorylation, whereas atractyloside
treatment that prevents mitochondrial import of the added adp
is the control. the results in fig. 4 show that ablation of
tb-trprs2 selectively knocks down oxphos that, in part,
depends on mitochondrial-encoded proteins but does not interfere with substrate level phosphorylation, which depends solely
on nuclear encoded proteins.
substrate specificities of tb-trprs1 and tb-trprs2. recent work in
leishmania (14) showed that the imported trnatrp is present in
two main forms: (i) the trnatrpcca carrying a mitochondriaspecific methylation on the c34 and (ii) the trnatrpuca in which
the methylated c34 has been edited to a methylated u and which
also contains a mitochondria-specific thiolated u33. furthermore,
it was shown that both trnatrp forms contain a mitochondriaspecific methylation on the ⌿32 (fig. 5a). fig. 5b shows that in t.
brucei ⬇85% of the imported trnatrp is thiolated. furthermore,
rt-pcr analysis by using cytosolic and mitochondrial rna as
substrates demonstrates that ⬇40% of mitochondrial trnatrp is
edited (fig. 5c). thus, in contrast to leishmania, where all thiolated trnatrp is edited (14), there is a population of t. brucei
trnatrp, which is thiolated but not edited.

editing can be analyzed by a restriction digest because it destroys a hinfi site that
is present in the cdna derived from the unedited trnatrp (14). introduction of a
synthetic hinfi plus 20 flanking nucleotides at the 5⬘ end of the 5⬘ rt-pcr primer
provides an internal control for the hinfi digestion, allowing the quantitative
determination of rna editing. cdna amplified from unedited trnatrp contains
two hinfi sites and, thus, will be digested into three fragments (46, 22, and 21 nt;
unedited). the cdna derived from edited trnatrp contains the synthetic hinfi site
only and will be digested into two fragments (68 and 21 nt; edited). measuring
the intensities of the diagnostic bands for nonedited (46 nt) and edited (68 nt)
trnatrp allows, after correcting for their different molecular mass, determination
of the fraction of edited trnatrp in t. brucei mitochondria. (d) in vitro aminoacylation assays by using [3h]tryptophan and recombinant tb-trprs1 as well as

tb-trprs1 and tb-trprs2 were overexpressed in escherichia coli
and purified to ⬎95% homogeneity. in vitro charging assays showed
that although neither enzyme was able to recognize in vitro transcripts corresponding to unedited or edited trnatrp (data not
shown), both efficiently aminoacylated isolated t. brucei cytosolic
trna (fig. 5d left). thus, the cytosolic unedited trnatrpcca can
be charged with very similar efficiencies by both the cytosolic and
the mitochondrial enzyme. interestingly, however, when using
isolated mitochondrial trnas as a substrate, the level of aminoacylation achieved by the cytosolic tb-trprs1 dropped to 19% of
that obtained with the mitochondrial enzyme (fig. 5d center
right). this fraction correlates with the level of nonthiolated
mitochondrial trnatrp (fig. 5b), suggesting that, in contrast to
mitochondrial tb-trprs2, tb-trprs1 is not able to charge thiolated trnatrp. fig. 5b shows that  xxxd2298xxx  treatment
produces a mitochondrial trnatrp population in which only 15%
(instead of 85%) of the molecules contain thiolated u33. interestingly, the h2o2-treated mitochondrial trna fraction can be
charged by cytosolic tb-trprs1 to a level that corresponds to
⬇40% of the one observed with the mitochondrial enzyme (fig. 5d
right). however, the reactivity of either enzyme did not change
when tested with h2o2-treated cytosolic trnas, which do not
contain thiolated trnatrp (fig. 5d center left). thus, removing
the thio group converts a population of mitochondrial trnatrp into
a substrate for the cytosolic tb-trprs1. interestingly, even in the
absence of thiolated u33, ⬇60% of the mitochondrial trnatrp
remained refractory to aminoacylation by the cytosolic enzyme.
the uncharged fraction represents ⬇50% of the thiolated u33
lacking trnatrp population and, thus, is similar to the ⬇40%
observed for the edited population. therefore, the most parsimonious explanation of these results is that the edited u34, just as the
thiolated u33, both act as independent antideterminants for cytosolic tb-trprs1. to confirm the charging results presented above,
we expressed the t. brucei trnatrpuca and trnatrpcca genes in
e. coli and isolated total trna. aminoacylation of these trna
samples with the two trprss demonstrated (fig. 5e) that the
mitochondrial tb-trprs2 enzyme charged both trnatrp isoacceptors, whereas the cytosolic tb-trprs1 acylated only
trnatrpcca. neither enzyme charged e. coli trna. thus, tbtrprs2 efficiently aminoacylates the unedited and edited fraction
of mitochondrial trnatrp. furthermore, the in vivo aminoacylation
level of total mitochondrial trnatrp was shown to be close to 80%
(fig. 3d). these results suggest that both isoacceptors are used in
mitochondrial protein synthesis, the unedited trnatrp being restricted to decode the standard ugg tryptophan codons.
our current understanding of the structure of eukaryotic
 xxxg2425xxx  does not allow a prediction of the anticodon binding sites
that might explain the different trna recognition properties.
based on structural modeling of human  xxxg2425xxx  (d. kennedy and
w. yin, unpublished data), the putative anticodon-binding
domain of tb-trprs1 extends from  xxxg270xxx -f373. the sequences
of the two tb-trprss are quite different in this region; they
share only 30% amino acid identity.
discussion
one of the few generalizations about mitochondrial trna
import states that only a small fraction of a given nuclear
encoded trna is imported and that the remainder functions in
cytosolic translation (9). thus, in all organisms, imported trnas
are always of the eukaryotic type. mitochondrial translation,
however, is of a bacterial evolutionary origin. trna import,
therefore, can be considered as a horizontal gene product
transfer between the eukaryotic and bacterial domains. there
are some fundamental differences between eukaryotic and
bacterial-type translation systems that, for some trnas, are
expected to prevent the dual use in the cytosol and in mitochondria. one such difference is necessitated by mitochondrial
variants of the genetic code. the most frequent code deviation
charrière et al.

charrière et al.

otic trprss that are able to charge mitochondrial trnatrp carrying
the nonstandard uca anticodon is a result of convergent evolution.
whether bacterial or eukaryotic  xxxg2425xxx  is used inside mitochondria
might be determined to a great extent by the discriminator nucleotide on the corresponding trnatrp and, therefore, depends on
whether the trnatrp is encoded in the mitochondrial dna or
imported from the cytosol.
thus tb-trprs2 represents an adaptation to the fact that the
trypanosomal mitochondrial translation system has to function
with eukaryotic-type trnas. another adaptation of the same
kind is the unusual t. brucei methionyl-trnamet formyltransferase (mtf), which because of the absence of a bacterial-type
initiator trnamet, has to  xxxd2154xxx  the only trnamet present in
mitochondria, which is the imported elongator trnamet (26, 27).
to perform their function, the trypanosomal mtf and the
tb-trprs2 had to develop a substrate specificity that is distinct
from their orthologues. trypanosomal mtf completely
switched its specificity and exclusively formylates elongator
trnamet, unlike all other mtfs, which only recognize bacterialtype initiator trnasmet. in the case of tb-trprs2, the enzyme
still recognizes the standard substrate for eukaryotic  xxxg2425xxx , the
trnatrpcca, but has extended its substrate specificity to
trnastrp carrying a thiolated u33 and an uca anticodon.
studies of the adaptations of mitochondrial translation factors
that interact directly with trnas (e.g., aarss, initiation factor 2
(28), or  xxxg678xxx ) to imported eukaryotic trnas
should yield additional surprises and reveal more fundamental
requirements of translation.

is the reassignment of the stop codon uga to tryptophan (3).
reading this reassigned codon requires a trnatrp with a uca
anticodon. simultaneous use of this trna in the cytosol and in
mitochondria, however, is not possible because it would act as a
nonsense suppressor in the cytosol. in line with this constraint,
it was recently shown that in most organisms that import trnas
the mitochondrial trnatrp gene has been retained (23). thus,
it is unexpected that trypanosomatids import the trnatrp. the
way leishmania mitochondria accommodate the change in the
genetic code is by mitochondria-specific c3u editing of the first
anticodon position of the imported trnatrp (13). in the present
work, we have analyzed the situation in the closely related t.
brucei and shown that although editing of the imported trnatrp
is necessary, it is not sufficient to allow decoding of the mitochondrial uga codons. the problem that arises is that the
mitochondrially localized trnatrp cannot be aminoacylated by
the standard eukaryotic-type  xxxg2425xxx  (tb-trprs1). in contrast to
most other trypanosomal aarss, which have dual location and
are used to charge cytosolic and imported trnas (16), tbtrprs1 is exclusively found in the cytosol. a survey of the
genome showed that t. brucei has a second  xxxg2425xxx  (tb-trprs2)
that is related to the cytosolic tb-trprs1 but is localized
exclusively in mitochondria. this enzyme has an extended substrate specificity and aminoacylates in vitro both cytosolic and
mitochondrial trnatrp. further studies showed that both the
thio-modified u33 and the c3u editing of the first nucleotide
in the anticodon prevent mitochondrial trnatrp to be recognized by the cytosolic tb-trprs1. the function of the thiolated
u33 in mitochondrial trnatrp of trypanosomatids is unknown
(14). however, the fact that it is localized immediately 5⬘ of the
first position of the anticodon suggests that it influences the
decoding properties of the trnatrp or that it even may be
required for trna editing. in most systems, the reassignment of
the uga codon is accommodated by a single mutation in the
mitochondrial trnatrp gene, which probably requires an adaptation of the mitochondrial  xxxg2425xxx  (3). the situation is different
for mitochondria of trypanosomatids because they need (i) a
mitochondria-specific trna editing enzyme that produces the
trnatrpuca (13) and (ii) a separate  xxxg2425xxx  (tb-trprs2) with
an extended substrate specificity. the need for a record  xxxg2425xxx 
is due to the fact that the c3u editing not only changes the
decoding properties of the trnatrp but also its identity toward
the classic  xxxg2425xxx  (tb-trprs1). thus, recoding of uga to
tryptophan appears to be more costly for trypanosomatids than
for other organisms.
doubly targeted aarss, which are able to aminoacylate both
nuclear-encoded trnas in the cytosol and the corresponding
mitochondrial encoded trnas, are found in most, if not all,
eukaryotes (2). in this study, we describe the converse situation
in that trnas derived from the same nuclear gene require two
distinct aarss for proper function. thus, the presence of a single
modification, be it the thio group on the u33 or the c3u editing
of the anticodon, is sufficient to prevent aminoacylation by
tb-trprs1. our results show that the notion that in an organism
all nuclear-encoded trna isoacceptors for a given amino acid
are charged by a single aars (4) is not universally valid.
the anticodon and the discriminator nucleotide are the major
identity elements for  xxxg2425xxx  (6, 7). whereas the anticodon is a
phylogenetically shared identity element, the discriminator nucleotide differs between bacteria and eukaryotes (6), which explains
why the two trprss cannot efficiently cross-aminoacylate the
corresponding trnatrp species (24, 25). most mitochondria decode uga as tryptophan, thus it is clear that the bacterial-type
mitochondrial  xxxg2425xxx  has evolved to tolerate an uca anticodon (3,
5). interestingly, the same applies for the eukaryotic mitochondrialocalized tb-trprs2 in t. brucei because, unlike the cytosolic
tb-trprs1, it is able to charge eukaryotic trnatrp carrying an
uca anticodon. thus, the existence of both bacterial and eukary-

isolated by digitonin extraction and subsequent rnase treatment as
described to yield a crude mitochondrial fraction that is essentially
free of cytosolic rnas (10). rna was isolated from the crude
mitochondrial fractions as well as uninduced and induced total cells
by using the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure (31), which
allows isolation of charged trna. then charged trna was separated from free trna on acid urea polyacrylamide gels as described
in ref. 20 and visualized by northern blot hybridization with labeled
oligonucleotides (trnatrp, tgaggactgcagggattg;
trnaleucag, cctccggagagatgacga; trnatyrgua, tggtccttccggccggaatcgaa).
cloning, overexpression, and purification of tb-trprs1 and tb-trprs2.

the gene sequences were pcr-amplified by using the expand
high fidelity pcr system (roche applied science). tb-trprs1
was cloned into ncoi兾xhoi in pet20b (novagen) with a cterminal his tag. for tb-trprs2, the n-terminal 21 amino acids
(mitochondrial leader sequence) were omitted, and the sequence
was cloned into the ndei兾xhoi in pet15b (novagen). after
sequence verification, the resulting plasmids were transformed
into e. coli bl-21-codonplus(de3)-ril cells (stratagene).
cells were grown at 37°c in lb medium supplemented with
ampicillin (100 ␮g兾ml) and chloramphenicol (34 ␮g兾ml), and
protein expression was autoinduced by using the overnight
express autoinduction system (novagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. after harvest, the cells were sonicated, and the proteins were purified by ni-nta chromatography (qiagen, valencia, ca). the desired fractions were pooled,
dialyzed against 50 mm na2hpo4, ph 8.0兾5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol兾50% glycerol, and stored at ⫺20°.
in vitro aminoacylation assays. (i) using native trna. mitochondria

were prepared by hypotonic lysis and percoll gradient centrifugation as described in ref. 32. the supernatant obtained after the
initial lysis was used to isolate cytosolic rnas by repeated
phenol extractions and ethanol precipitations. mitochondrial
rna was isolated from gradient purified mitoplasts by the acid
guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure (31). a cumulative 25liter t. brucei culture yielded 6 mg of mitochondrial rna. total
