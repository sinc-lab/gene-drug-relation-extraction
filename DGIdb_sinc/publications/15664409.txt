full-length cdnas of  xxxg2317xxx  ( xxxg2317xxx ) were cloned by screening a human placental cdna library, which encode a 243
amino acid protein, identical to human thiamin pyrophosphokinase (htpk) as confirmed by protein sequence analysis. genomic
alignment showed that the  xxxg2317xxx /htpk gene contains 9 exons. it is abundantly expressed in placenta, as numerous est clones
were identified. as thiamine metabolism deficiencies have been seen in placental infarcts previously, these indicate that  xxxg2317xxx /
htpk may have a role in placental diseases. analysis of the 1 kb promoter region showed numerous putative transcription factor
binding sites, which might be responsible for the ubiquitous  xxxg2317xxx /htpk expression. this may also be in accordance with the
presence of the protein in tissues responsible for the regulation of the exquisite balance between cell division, differentiation and
survival. tpk activity of the purified and recombinant protein was proved by mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization. by
western blot,  xxxg2317xxx /htpk was found in all human normal and tumorous adult and fetal tissues in nearly equal amounts, but not
in sera. by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent confocal imaging methods, diffuse labelling in the cytoplasm of the
syncytiotrophoblasts and weak staining of the trophoblasts were observed, and the amount of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk decreased from the first
trimester to the end of gestation. a 3d model of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk was computed (pdb no.: 1oly) by homology modelling. a high
degree of structural homology showed that the thiamin binding site was highly similar to that of the mouse enzyme, but highly
different from the bacterial ones. comparison of the catalytic centre sequences revealed differences, raising the possibility of
designing new drugs which specifically inhibit bacterial and fungal enzymes without affecting  xxxg2317xxx /htpk and offering the
possibility for safe antimicrobial therapy during pregnancy.

introduction
pregnancy-related proteins have been investigated worldwide
since the sixties. these proteins are synthesized in increased
amounts during pregnancy and seem to play an important role
in the development of the fetus and the placenta and in the
maintenance of pregnancy. after birth, placental protein gene
expression is repressed, but could be re- and overexpressed in

various pathological diseases during lifetime [1]. our research
group has sequenced and performed the molecular biological
characterization of some of these proteins [2e5].
isolation and physicochemical characterization of soluble
placental tissue protein 20 ( xxxg2317xxx ) was described in 1985 by
bohn and winckler [6].  xxxg2317xxx  was found to be composed of
two identical 27 kda subunits which were held together by
non-covalent bonds. the carbohydrate content of  xxxg2317xxx  was
found to be relatively low (3.0% by weight) and the average
amount of  xxxg2317xxx  present in one human term placenta was
found to be 0.5 mg [6]. by immunohistochemical studies, in
human early placenta,  xxxg2317xxx  was found to be mainly located in
the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast, and

chorionic trophoblast. in term placentas the protein was
clearly localized mainly in the cytoplasm of hofbauer-like cells
in the villous stroma, as well as in the reflected and basal
chorionic trophoblast, but not localized in term villi [7]. with
an electroimmunoassay,  xxxg2317xxx  could not be detected in normal
sera, pregnancy sera, cord blood sera or amniotic fluid, and the
protein appeared not to be placenta specific [6].
however, those investigations were unable to provide any
information on the possible role of  xxxg2317xxx . in this study we
report the isolation, characterization and sequence analysis of
full-length cdnas encoding  xxxg2317xxx . by databank search,  xxxg2317xxx 
turned out to be identical to the human thiamin pyrophosphokinase (htpk), which was confirmed by the amino acid
sequencing of placental isolated  xxxg2317xxx  ( xxxg2317xxx -b) by mass
spectrometry (ms). detailed analysis of the  xxxg2317xxx /htpk gene
showed its unique structure and special putative regulation. a
3d model of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk was created using the program
molscript and the atomic coordinates of the mouse
thiamin pyrophosphokinase, the reference protein with the
highest homology.  xxxg2317xxx /htpk protein was expressed for
functional studies, and the recombinant protein ( xxxg2317xxx -r) also
had thiamin pyrophosphokinase enzymatic activity determined
by hplcems with electrospray ionization (esi). the
expression pattern and subcellular localization of  xxxg2317xxx  in
human term placenta was also determined. a comparison of
the thiamin binding sites of tpks in some significant species
revealed major differences, indicating the pharmacological
potency of thiamin pyrophosphokinase inhibitors.
materials and methods
materials
 xxxg2317xxx  antigen (lot no. 41/60) and anti- xxxg2317xxx  polyclonal rabbit
serum (461za) were prepared by dr. hans bohn, behringwerke
ag, germany [6]. escherichia coli xl1-blue mrf strain,
human placental uni-zapô xr expression cdna library and
an in vitro packaging system were purchased from stratagene
(la jolla, ca, usa). we obtained hela (human cervical
epithelial adenocarcinoma), hepg2 (human liver hepatocellular

and t3 and sequence specific oligonucleotide primers (sigmaaldrich co., st. louis, mo, usa).
blood and tissue samples
specimens (n ¼ 39) were collected from different types of
human tissues. normal fetal (n ¼ 12) and adult (n ¼ 25) tissues
including first trimester (10the12th gestational week) and term
placenta, or tumorous tissues (n ¼ 6) were investigated. after
homogenization by ultraturrax in standard laemmli sample
solution containing 1 mm pmsf, all the samples were ultracentrifuged (10,000g for 10 min), the supernatants were
measured by bicinchonicic acid (bca) reagent assay and
equalized for 1 mg/ml protein content. blood was collected
from patients with carcinomas (ovarian-, chorio-, cervix-,
corpus-) and from healthy pregnant women at the 8th, 14th,
20th, 24th, 28th and 32nd gestational weeks. sera were
separated by ultracentrifugation and diluted equally in standard
laemmli sample solution. all samples were stored at 20 (c
until assay. placentas were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded,
cut into 4 mm sections, mounted on slides, dried at 37 (c
overnight, dewaxed and rehydrated for further immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescent confocal imaging.
cell cultures
hela, hepg2, panc-1 and wrl-68 cells were grown on 100mm dishes in standard dmem containing 1% antibioticeantimycotic solution, supplemented with 10% fcs under 5%
co2 condition and 95% humidified air at 37 (c. cells were
harvested and low-speed centrifuged, then the pellet was
dispersed by vortexing in lysis buffer (50 mm tris ph 7.4,
1 mm pmsf) for 10 min at 4 (c. after further cell disruption
in a teflon/glass homogenizer, the homogenate was pelleted,
and the supernatant was measured by bca reagent and
equalized for 1 mg/ml protein content in 2! laemmli
solution for western blotting.
cloning and sequence analyses of  xxxg2317xxx 
cdnas
a placental expression cdna library was plated on 150-mm
petri dishes at 100,000 plaques/plate for the identification of
cdnas encoding  xxxg2317xxx . l phage protein expression was
induced with 10 mm iptg. from all plates, replicas were
loaded onto nitrocellulose membranes and anti- xxxg2317xxx  serum was
used to screen the filters. primary immunoreaction was detected
by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit igg and developed by the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro
blue tetrazolium phosphatase reaction system. positive plaques
were isolated and plaque-purified by rescreening five more
times by the same procedure. l phages were converted into
pbluescript sk phagemids with r408 helper phage by the
method of short and sorge [8]. miscellaneous procedures were
performed as published in sambrook et al. [9]. plasmid
preparation was carried out with qiaprep spin miniprep
kit. both sense and antisense strands of the cdnas were

sequenced by primer walking. sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination chemistry was performed by taq
bigdye terminator cycle sequencing using an automated abi
prism 310 genetic analyzer (perkineelmer, usa). sequences were analyzed using the ncbi database.
databank search
 xxxg2317xxx  cdnas were compared to different ests and genomic
databases by blast algorithm [10]. alignment of the longest
 xxxg2317xxx  cdna and related ests to genomic sequences was
performed with locuslink [11], all provided by ncbi
(bethesda, md, usa). transfac database [12] was searched
for putative transcription binding sites at 1 kb of the 5#
flanking region of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk gene using the patch algorithm
(gbf-braunschweig, germany).
protein identiﬁcation by mass spectrometry
the highly purified  xxxg2317xxx -b antigen was diluted in 2!
laemmli sample buffer, separated by 12% (w/v) sds-page
and visualized by coomassie staining. bands of interest were
excised from the gel, reduced, alkylated and in-gel digested
with trypsin as described previously [13]. proteins were
identified by a combination of maldi-tof mass spectrometry (ms) peptide mapping and maldi post source decay
(psd) ms sequencing. the digests were purified with
ziptipc18 pipette tips with a saturated aqueous solution of
2,5- xxxd30xxx  matrix (ratio of 1:1). a bruker
reflex iv maldi-tof mass spectrometer (bruker-daltonics,
bremen, germany) was employed for peptide mass mapping in
positive ion reflector mode with delayed extraction. the
monoisotopic masses for all peptide ion signals in the acquired
spectra were determined and used for database searching against
a non-redundant database (ncbi, bethesda, md, usa) using
ms fit program (ucsf, san francisco, ca, usa) [14].
primary structures of tryptic peptide ions were confirmed by
psd sequencing.
construction of bacterial  xxxg2317xxx / xxxg2317xxx 
expression plasmid
from the pbluescript plasmid containing the full-length  xxxg2317xxx 
cdna, the whole open reading frame was pcr amplified with
5#-aggatccatggagcatgcctttaccccgttgg3# and 5#-aaactcgagcacacttatggatgccag-3#
primers. the resultant pcr product was cloned into the
bamhi and xho1 sites of the pgex-4t-1 expression vector.
expression and puriﬁcation of  xxxg2317xxx / xxxg2317xxx 
the  xxxg2317xxx -r/pgex-4t-1 expression vector was transformed
into e. coli dh5a competent host strain. after isolation of the
plasmid, it was transformed into e. coli bl21 host strain.
bacteria were induced with iptg, and the expressed protein
was subsequently purified with glutathione sepharose 4b
column in the presence of glutathione, after which thrombin

cleavage was carried out. the purity of  xxxg2317xxx -r was verified by
immunoblotting with anti- xxxg2317xxx  serum.
analysis of  xxxg2317xxx / xxxg2317xxx  enzymatic activity
by using hplcems with electrospray
ionization (esi)
five portions of thiamin were dissolved in 1.5 ml of 100 mm
hepes ( ph 7.4, 1 mm mgcl2, 1 mm atp) to a final
concentration of 1 mm. twenty micrograms of  xxxg2317xxx -b and
 xxxg2317xxx -r antigens were added to one of the samples; in control
cases,  xxxg2317xxx  was excluded from the mixture or 20 mg of heat
denaturated  xxxg2317xxx -b or  xxxg2317xxx -r was added. all the samples
were then incubated for 10 h at 37 (c, following which the
analysis of thiamin and thiamin-pyrophosphate was carried out
using hplcems with electrospray ionization (esi). the
hplcems instrument consisted of a dionex p 580 lowpressure gradient pump, a rheodyne 8125 injector with 20 ml
loop, a dionex uvd 340s diode array detector, and a dionex
aqa mass spectrometer. instrument control and data
acquisition were performed using chromeleon data management software. the column (150!4:6 mm) was packed with
5 mm particle size endcapped c18 reversed phase material.
the mobile phase was 0.1 m ammonium-acetate (ph 7.0)/
methanol = 95/5. the flow rate was 1.2 ml/min. esi ionization was performed in positive mode enabling us to obtain
positively charged molecular ions ([thiamin + h]+, [thiaminpyrophosphate + h]+).
sds-page/coomassie staining or
western blot
twenty micrograms of  xxxg2317xxx -b and  xxxg2317xxx -r proteins were
subjected to 12% (w/v) sds-page and visualized by
coomassie staining for subsequent ms protein identification.
ten nanograms of  xxxg2317xxx -b,  xxxg2317xxx -r and 20 mg protein of
serum, tissue and cell culture samples were subjected to 12%
(w/v) sds/page (bio-rad, hercules, ca, usa). immunoblotting was carried out as described in sambrook et al. [9].
protein bands were revealed by the ecl chemiluminescence
analysis system.
immunohistochemistry
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were incubated with polyclonal anti- xxxg2317xxx  serum. immunostaining was
carried out according to the streptavidinebiotineperoxidase
technique, with  xxxd2298xxx /3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole
development using the universal kit [15]. control sections
were incubated only with secondary igg. visual evaluation of
haematoxylin-counterstained slides was performed using an
olympus bx50 light microscope with incorporated photography system (olympus optical co., hamburg, germany).
immunoﬂuorescence confocal microscopy
after deparaffination, placental tissue sections were washed
with distilled water and tbs (ph 7.4, 10 mm tris, 140 mm

bellyei et al.: cloning, sequencing, structural and molecular biological characterization of  xxxg2317xxx 

nacl) and digested with trypsin for 30 min. the slides were
rinsed with tbs and pbs (ph 7.3, 140 mm nacl, 2.7 mm
kcl, 10 mm na2hpo4, 1.8 mm kh2po4) followed by
treatment with polyclonal anti- xxxg2317xxx  serum. subsequently
parallel labelling with fitc labelled secondary igg, and
20 mm draq5 nucleus dye labelling in pbs and 0.1% (v/v)
bsa were carried out. control sections were incubated only
with secondary iggs. cell fluorescence was monitored by
a bio-rad mrc-1024es laser scanning confocal attachment
(herefordshire, uk) mounted on a nikon eclipse te-300
inverted microscope (kingstone, uk).
construction of the 3d model of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk
multiple amino acid sequence alignment of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk to its
homologues was carried out with clustalw at emb-net
(lausanne, ch) [16]. the prosite [17] and netphos [18]
databases were searched for biologically significant patterns
and putative phosphorylation sites on  xxxg2317xxx /htpk by protein
explorer and visualized by rasmol [19]. a standard comparative modelling with molscript on a linux pc workstation was performed as described by kraulis [20]. because of
the high degree of homology of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk to mouse tpk
(89% sequence identity), it was satisfactory to use the mouse
tpk as a single reference protein. the atomic coordinates of
the reference protein were obtained from the protein data
bank [21]. the resolution of the x-ray structure used as
reference was 1.9 å [22] and the structure was obtained for
the mtpk complexed with thiamin (pdb acc. no.: 1ig3).
further refinement was not performed because of the high
degree of identity between the target and reference structures.
results
cloning and sequence analyses of  xxxg2317xxx  cdnas
immunoscreening of 2!106 recombinant plaques of the
human placental cdna library with anti- xxxg2317xxx  serum yielded
4 positive recombinant clones. through the determination of
the entire nucleotide sequences of all cdnas, the clones
turned out to contain full-length inserts encoding the same
protein. the largest, 2431 bp cdna (genbank acc. no.:
ay206415), contained an 85 bp 5# untranslated region followed
by a coding region of 731 bp and a 3# untranslated region of
1614 bp including two proposed (5#-aataaa-3#) polyadenylation signals. the first atg was likely to be the translation
initiator codon located in an optimal context (5#-tccgttatgg-3#) typical for vertebrate mrnas recognized by the
40s ribosome subunit [23] (figure 1). the mature protein
consisted of 243 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of

37

27.265 kda and a theoretical pi of 5.03. the entire nucleotide
sequences of  xxxg2317xxx  cdnas proved to be identical to human
thiamin pyrophosphokinase (genbank acc. no.: aak01351),
except that the longest  xxxg2317xxx  cdna contained 3 additional
nucleotides at its 5# end compared to  xxxg2317xxx  cdna. by
alignment search,  xxxg2317xxx  had high homology (89% identity, 95%
homology) to mouse thiamin pyrophosphokinase (mtpk).
genomic localization, structure and regulation
of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk gene
genbank searches revealed human ests in various adult and
fetal human tissues with a predominant expression in placenta.
genomic alignment of the longest  xxxg2317xxx  cdna and ests
mapped the  xxxg2317xxx /htpk gene (locus id: 27010) to chromosome 7q34-q36 (genomic contig: nt_007914), containing 9
exons, not 8 as published previously [24,25], sized from 59 to
1721 bp. the gene coding sequence was extremely long (384 kb)
with all exoneintron boundaries conforming to consensus
sequences [26]. the sequence contained a tata-box-like
sequence (38) and an initiator element (inr) as do other genes
with a consensus tata-box-less promoter [27]. the 5# end of
the longest  xxxg2317xxx  cdna started at position c4 compared to the
putative start site (a) in the inr, which consisted of a consensus
sequence. a downstream promoter element (dpe; c38) and
consensus gc-rich sequences, binding sites for sp-1 and gcf
transcription factors might also act in the transcription initiation
(figure 1). analysis of 1 kb of the promoter region showed numerous putative consensus transcription factor binding sequences
clustered preceding the 5# end of the first exon (table 1).
identiﬁcation of  xxxg2317xxx -b as human thiamin
pyrophosphokinase
after sds-page, in the case of placental derived  xxxg2317xxx -b,
major bands at 27 and 54 kda were detected by coomassie
staining. no additional bands in lower or higher molecular
weight regions could be identified, indicating high purity of the
protein. the two bands were cut from the gel, then malditof ms peptide mapping with maldi-psd ms sequencing
was performed. both protein bands yielded good quality peptide
maps, and most of the input masses matched the candidate
protein sequences. the majority of the tryptic peptides matched
with the theoretical masses within 97.4 ppm. maldi-tof
ms data of the 27 and 54 kda proteins in both cases permitted
the identification of human thiamin pyrophosphokinase (acc.
no.: aak01351), and suggested that the 54 kda band was
a  xxxg2317xxx /htpk dimer. psd data obtained for precursors also
confirmed the identity of these proteins (table 2).

boldface capitals, 8 introns as well as the 5# and 3# untranslated regions in lowercase italics, and the consensus gt/ag splice junction sites underlined. start
(atg) and stop (taa) codons in exons 2 and 9 are inverse typed. the double underlined tata-box-like sequence (38), an initiator element (inr; putative
initiation site shaded) and downstream promoter element (dpe; +38) might act in the transcription initiation. polyadenylation signal is boxed. the consensus gcrich sequences, binding sites for sp-1 (shadowed) and gcf (boxed) transcription factors are indicated. the deduced amino acid sequence of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk protein
is shown highlighted under the nucleotide sequence.

putative binding sites for transcription factors in 1 kb of the  xxxg2317xxx /htpk gene
promoter were searched in transfac database by the patch algorithm. their
binding positions were indicated relative to the putative inr.

determination of the enzymatic activity
of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk
mass spectrometry with esi proved to be a useful method.
using the soft ionization technique, only the protonated
sample molecules and the molecular ions could be generated
without fragmentation; therefore, identification became easy.
in our experimental conditions, overfragmentation could be
neglected and the molecular peaks were observed with high
intensity. the thiamin-pyrophosphate eluted at 2.91 min,
indicating evidence of thiamin pyrophosphokinase activity for
both  xxxg2317xxx -b and  xxxg2317xxx -r. thiamin was eluted  xxxd2274xxx .34 min
(figure 2a). (the retention time of atp was 2.02 min, and
for amp 2.38 min.) our compounds of interest were identified
by their retention times, uvevis and mass spectra. the
molecular thiamin-pyrophosphate peak (scan filter: 50 v)
could be observed at 424.7 amu, with high intensity (figure
2b). the other mass peaks were from the earlier eluted polar
compounds contaminating the thiamin-pyrophosphate peak.
the molecular thiamin peak (scan filter: 100 v) could be
observed at 264.8 amu (figure 2c). no fragmentation of
thiamin occurred [28,29]. the peak purity test of thiaminpyrophosphate showed that the uv spectra did not match each
other particularly well. this was indicated by the degree of
match, which was 964, with a standard deviation of 6.15%. by
thiamin, the two curves covered each other perfectly. this was

protein identification and sequencing were described in materials and methods. most of the input masses matched the candidate protein sequences, and the
majority of the tryptic peptides matched theoretical masses within 97 ppm. maldi-tof and psd ms data identified the 27 kda protein as  xxxg2317xxx /htpk, and the
54 kda protein as its dimer.

the peak is completely pure. if the match factor is over 950,
peak purity is completely acceptable.)
expression and localization of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk
in western blot analysis,  xxxg2317xxx -b and  xxxg2317xxx -r proteins
migrated in 27 and 54 kda bands as described before [6].
immunologically identical bands were detected in human term
placental tissue. from 39 other types of human tissue, the
highly specific anti- xxxg2317xxx  serum reacted both with the 27 kda
protein and with the dimer in all fetal and adult tissues, as they
were expressed in equal amounts and ubiquitously (figure
3a). the expression of  xxxg2317xxx  decreased from the first trimester
to the third, and there was no remarkable difference between
the amounts of the protein in normal placentas and those from
pregnancies affected by preeclampsia or iugr (figure 3b).
the immunoreactive protein bands could also be detected
universally in the examined tumorous tissues as well as in
various cell line extracts.  xxxg2317xxx /htpk was not detectable in
the circulation of pregnant women, or in the sera of healthy
and tumorous patients (table 3). in healthy human placental
tissues, localization of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk was studied by different

immunological techniques. with immunohistochemistry, diffuse and stronger labelling in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblasts and very weak staining of the trophoblasts and
hofbauer cells could be seen in first trimester placentas
(figure 4a). a moderate labelling in the cytoplasm of the
syncytiotrophoblasts and very weak staining of the trophoblasts and hofbauer cells in the third trimester (figure 4b)
and preeclamptic placenta (figure 4c) were found. by the
more sensitive immunofluorescent confocal imaging, we
detected the subcellular localization of  xxxg2317xxx , which appeared
to be diffuse in the cytoplasm (figure 4d).
structural model of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk
comparative structural modelling satisfying all spatial restraints revealed that the fold and backbone structure of  xxxg2317xxx /
htpk corresponded to the structure of mouse tpk. the root
mean square deviation (rmsd) between the mouse and
 xxxg2317xxx /htpk was 0.17 å, which indicated minor structural
differences only.  xxxg2317xxx /htpk also consisted of an n-terminal
alpha/beta-domain and the c-terminal beta-sandwich domain.
the overall dimensions of the subunits were about 56 å length

placenta (2005), vol. 26

and 31 å width. the thiamin binding site was formed by a betabulge between ser216b-asn219b, with the loops between
gly199b-asn203b, and between asp95a-asp100a, as in the
mouse enzyme (figure 5b). the vicinity of the suspected atp
binding site was also identical to that of the mouse protein,
except for the 129 alanineeglycine change, as shown in the
sequence alignment (figure 5a), where the binding sites were
shaded. sequential alignment was performed at the subunit
level. both polypeptide chains consisted of 243 amino acids, and
no deletions or insertions were present. the best alignment was
obtained without gap insertion. analysis of various tpk amino
acid sequences in their catalytic centre indicated a high level of
conservation in mammals, compared to bacteria, but in fungi
there were greater differences. in the first cluster, out of 6 amino
acids, 3 were different in prokaryotes and in lower eukaryotes.
in the second cluster, out of 5 amino acids, 3 or 4 were different.
in the third cluster, 50% of the amino acids were different in
bacteria and fungi from the human sequence. these data
showed that tpk is an enzyme with an active centre very
significantly different in human enzymes compared to bacterial
and fungal enzymes, raising the possibility of designing specific
drugs which could inhibit bacterial and/or fungal tpks

figure 4. localization of  xxxg2317xxx /htpk in human placental tissues. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of human first trimester (a), term (b, d)
and preeclamptic placentas (c) were stained for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescent confocal microscopy, respectively, using polyclonal anti- xxxg2317xxx  serum.
the immunohistochemical sections were counterstained with haematoxylin (400! magnification). a stronger  xxxg2317xxx  expression was seen in the syncytiotrophoblasts
(arrow) of the first trimester placenta (a), and moderate expression could be detected in the syncytiotrophoblasts (arrow) with a weak staining of the
cytotrophoblasts (arrowhead) and hofbauer cells in term and preeclamptic placentas (b, c). the confocal image was counterstained by draq5 nucleus dye (red)
(1000! magnification). diffuse  xxxg2317xxx  staining (green) could be recognized in the cytoplasm of syncytiotrophoblasts (arrow), and its discrete labelling in the
cytotrophoblasts (arrowhead) (d).

discussion
the cdnas encoding  xxxg2317xxx  ( xxxg2317xxx ) were
identified and sequence analyzed. through the determination
of the entire nucleotide sequences, the cdnas turned out to
contain full-length inserts encoding the same protein. the
largest cdna was 2431 bp long and the encoded mature protein
consisted of 243 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of
27.265 kda. on sds/page,  xxxg2317xxx  was found to have two
variants (27 kda and 54 kda), as described by bohn and
winckler [6], and the 54 kda variant was verified to be a  xxxg2317xxx 
antigen dimer. by its primary nucleotide sequence,  xxxg2317xxx 

proved to be identical to human thiamin pyrophosphokinase
(htpk). using the results of maldi-tof ms analysis of
protein sequencing,  xxxg2317xxx  and its dimer were again confirmed to
be htpk. genbank search information revealed that the  xxxg2317xxx /
htpk gene was located on chromosome 7q34-q36 and was
predominantly expressed in the placenta. the genomic
sequence contained 9 exons, not 8 as published previously
when the exon division and 5# upstream region of the gene were
not yet resolved [24,25].
the genomic sequence for the gene was extremely long
(384 kb), and numerous putative consensus transcription
factor binding sequences were detected by the analysis of its
1 kb 5# flanking region. for the ubiquitous expression of the
protein, the numerous ap-1 [30], ap-2 [31] and sp-1 [32]
sites might be responsible. four potential  xxxg1486xxx  sites may be
responsible for the regulation of the exquisite balance between

figure 6. multiple sequence analysis of tpks at their catalytic centre. at the first cluster, aspartates and threonine were highly conserved from bacteria to
mammals, but more changes occurred in fungi. at the second cluster, only lysine was conserved from bacteria to mammals in contrast to fungi, whilst the other 4
amino acids were conserved in mammals. in the third cluster, serine and asparagine were highly conserved.

cell division, differentiation and survival [33] and may account
for the expression of the gene in the gastrointestinal tract
and haematopoietic system. the presence of various  xxxg2214xxx ,
stat-1 and stat-3 [34] binding sites suggested that  xxxg2317xxx /
htpk expression could be regulated by interferon. to verify
the exact functional role of these putative transcriptional
factor binding sites, further in vitro experiments should be
performed.
a bacterial  xxxg2317xxx -r/pgex-4t-1 plasmid was constructed,
and the protein was highly expressed and purified. the thiamin
pyrophosphokinase activity of both  xxxg2317xxx -b and  xxxg2317xxx -r was
confirmed by mass spectrometry provided with esi. thiamin
pyrophosphokinase is present in all types of human cells. its
function is the catalysis of pyrophosphorylation of thiamin
(vitamin b1) with atp and  xxxd2531xxx . in humans,
thiamin is absorbed from the gut, transported into cells, and
converted into an active coenzyme form, thiamin-pyrophosphate (tpp) [35,36]. tpp serves as a cofactor for 2-oxoacid
dehydrogenase-like pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, branching chain
alpha ketoacid dehydrogenase or transketolase in pentose
phosphate cycle. tpp-dependent enzymes are essential in
carbohydrate metabolism and mitochondrial energy metabolism. thiamin is an essential vitamin for vertebrates [37];
therefore its utilization and pyrophosphorylation have high
significance for cell viability and function in vertebrates. tpp
synthesis can be important in the placenta because of its high
energy requirement. thiamine/tpp deficiencies have been
seen in placental infarcts, indicating that tpp function and
tpp expression can have a role in placental diseases [35,36].
reports of several diseases and syndromes can be found in the
literature in connection with thiamin deficiency or decreased
thiamin pyrophosphokinase activity. according to two studies
examining thiamin metabolism, thiamin and tpk enzyme
deficiencies are associated with diabetes mellitus, sensorineural
deafness and thiamin-responsive megaloblastic anemia [38,39].
another publication referred to didmoad syndrome (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness)
associated with megaloblastic and sideroblastic anemia, neutropenia, and borderline thrombocytopenia. the authors proposed that an inherited abnormality of thiamin metabolism was
responsible for the multisystem degenerative disorder [40].
another study supposed that adverse effects of the antibiotic
metronidazole might be due to its conversion to a thiamin

analogue and consequent vitamin b1 antagonism. a metabolic
product was found to be a close structural analogue of thiamin
and an effective inhibitor of tpk in vitro [41]. a recent
prospective controlled cohort study confirmed that metronidazole did not represent a major teratogenic risk in humans when
used in the recommended doses, but a reduced neonatal birth
weight was found in the metronidazole group compared with
controls [42]. this could be explained by metronidazole’s
metabolic conversion and a possible serious effect on placental
metabolism through the  xxxg2317xxx /htpk pathway.
by western blot analysis, the molecular masses of  xxxg2317xxx 
(27 kda and 54 kda) turned out to be identical to the calculated
masses.  xxxg2317xxx  was found in all human normal and tumorous
adult and fetal tissues in nearly equal amounts, as described
before [24]. we also detected the protein in some human cell line
extracts, but not in the sera of healthy pregnant women, or
tumorous patients. we were unable to confirm the results of
other research groups who found differences in the expression
levels of htpk, especially higher amounts in testis, small
intestine and kidney by northern blot [25]. others stated that
the mouse tpk mrna levels were expressed in a tissue specific
manner and found in high levels in kidney and liver [43]. our
findings confirm the data that  xxxg2317xxx /htpk is ubiquitously
expressed in a wide variety of human tissues and appears to be
an important housekeeping metabolic gene in humans.
immunohistochemical studies have previously shown that in
human early placenta,  xxxg2317xxx  was mainly located in the
cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast, and in
term placentas, and the protein was clearly localized mainly in
the cytoplasm of hofbauer-like cells in the villous stroma as
well as reflected and basal chorionic trophoblast [7]. these
findings suggested that the villous syncytiotrophoblast might
lose the ability to produce this protein with placental aging.
our investigations supplemented these data as we studied first
and third trimester normal placentas as well as placentas from
pregnancies affected by preeclampsia or iugr. immunohistochemistry showed a stronger diffuse  xxxg2317xxx /htpk labelling
in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblasts and a very weak
staining of the trophoblasts in first trimester placentas. during
placental aging,  xxxg2317xxx /htpk expression decreased, as lower
expression was found in third trimester placentas. in preeclamptic and iugr placentas, only slight decreases in  xxxg2317xxx /
htpk expression were detected. by the more sensitive

bellyei et al.: cloning, sequencing, structural and molecular biological characterization of  xxxg2317xxx 

immunofluorescent confocal imaging, the diffuse intracytoplasmic localization of the protein in syncytiotrophoblasts was
observed.
based on the high degree of homology and the results of our
comparative 3d modelling, the model of which was accepted
and deposited at ebi macromolecular structure database
under pdb acc. no. 1oly, we concluded that the thiamin
binding site of the human tpk enzyme was highly similar to
that of the mouse enzyme. however, sequences of human and
fungal tpks were only 30% identical [44]. in addition, bacterial
tpks were also highly different from the human enzymes,
having only about 25% identity [43]. in the case of fungal tpks,
in the first region of the active site, two negatively charged
aspartates substituted to neutral cysteine and asparagine. in the
second region, a positively charged lysine was exchanged to
negatively charged glutamate, showing the important structural

45

and charge differences in the active site. in the case of bacterial
enzymes, in the first region, histidine, which could be positively
charged at neutral ph, was substituted by neutral or negatively
charged amino acids. in the second region, gl and wn pairs
were changed to different space-filling groups, or in some cases
to partially negatively charged tyrosine groups. these data
showed a significant difference in the active sites of tpks in
different species. even higher differences could be seen in the
charge and size of space filling, raising the possibility for
designing drugs which specifically inhibit bacterial and fungal
enzymes without affecting human tpk. therefore, this study
indicates the possibility that special tpk inhibitors could be
used as potential antimicrobial agents [22], which not only have
no effect on  xxxg2317xxx /htpk generally, but whose development and
administration may also enable safe antimicrobial therapy
during pregnancy.
