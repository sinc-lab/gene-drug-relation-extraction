abstract

tfelt-hansen et al.

triptans are a new class of compounds developed for the treatment of migraine
attacks. the first of the class, sumatriptan, and the newer triptans ( xxxd3562xxx ,
naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd1976xxx , almotriptan and frovatriptan) display high agonist activity at mainly the serotonin 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  subtypes. as
expected for a class of compounds developed for affinity at a specific receptor,
there are minor pharmacodynamic differences between the triptans.
sumatriptan has a low oral bioavailability (14%) and all the newer triptans
have an improved oral bioavailability and for one,  xxxd3135xxx , the rate of absorption is faster. the half-lives of naratriptan,  xxxd1976xxx  and, in particular, frovatriptan (26 to 30h) are longer than that of sumatriptan (2h). these pharmacokinetic
improvements of the newer triptans so far seem to have only resulted in minor
differences in their efficacy in migraine.
double-blind, randomised clinical trials (rcts) comparing the different
triptans and triptans with other medication should ideally be the basis for judging
their place in migraine therapy. in only 15 of the 83 reported rcts were 2 triptans
compared, and in 11 trials triptans were compared with other drugs. therefore,
in all placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials, the relative efficacy of the
triptans was also judged by calculating the therapeutic gain (i.e. percentage response for active minus percentage response for placebo). the mean therapeutic
gain with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg (51%) was more than that for all other
dosage forms of triptans (oral sumatriptan 100mg 32%; oral sumatriptan 50mg
29%; intranasal sumatriptan 20mg 30%; rectal sumatriptan 25mg 31%; oral
 xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg 32%; oral  xxxd3135xxx  10mg 37%; oral  xxxd1976xxx  40mg 37%;
oral almotriptan 12.5mg 26%). compared with oral sumatriptan 100mg (32%),
the mean therapeutic gain was higher with oral  xxxd1976xxx  80mg (42%) but lower
with oral naratriptan 2.5mg (22%) or oral frovatriptan 2.5mg (16%). the few
direct comparative randomised clinical trials with oral triptans reveal the same
picture. recurrence of headache within 24 hours after an initial successful response occurs in 30 to 40% of sumatriptan-treated patients. apart from naratriptan, which has a tendency towards less recurrence, there appears to be no
consistent difference in recurrence rates between the newer triptans and
sumatriptan.  xxxd3135xxx  with its shorter time to maximum concentration (tmax)
tended to produce a quicker onset of  xxxd234xxx  than sumatriptan and
 xxxd3562xxx .
the place of triptans compared with non- xxxd3263xxx  drugs in migraine therapy
remains to be established and further rcts are required.

the triptans are a new class of compounds
known as serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht)
5-ht1b/1d, previously 5-ht1-like/ xxxg1110xxx ,[1,2] receptor agonists. the first of this family, sumatriptan, is undoubtedly a significant advance in migraine therapy.[3-9] despite its great utility in
migraine treatment, sumatriptan has certain limitations: for example, low oral bioavailability; high

headache recurrence (for definition, see section
5.1.5), possibly due to a short half-life; and contraindication in patients with coronary artery disease.
therefore, a number of newer triptans with agonist
activity at 5-ht1b/1d receptors have been developed. several such compounds ( xxxd3562xxx ,  xxxd3135xxx  and naratriptan) are already on the market,
while others ( xxxd1976xxx , almotriptan and frovadrugs 2000 dec; 60 (6)

 xxxd3263xxx ) are in advanced stages of clinical development (for chemical structures, see figure 1). despite
the efficacy of avitriptan,[10,11] bms-181885[12]
and the non- xxxd3263xxx  alniditan[13] in the treatment of
migraine, these compounds are no longer in clinical development. in this review, we discuss the
pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of these triptans, the randomised placebo-controlled clinical
trials with triptans demonstrating their efficacy and
evaluating the optimum dose, randomised clinical
trials (rcts) comparing triptans, and rcts comparing triptans with other treatments.

1. pharmacological effects of triptans
1.1 receptor binding profile

sumatriptan and the newer triptans display high
affinities at 5-ht1 receptor subtypes, mainly the
5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (table i).[14-22] there
are no profound differences in affinities at the 5ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors. these compounds
also interact with 5-ht1a and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors,
but  xxxd3135xxx  appears to be more selective for 5ht1b/1d receptors. however, it must be said that

the non- xxxd3263xxx  compound, alniditan, which has
shown efficacy in migraine,[13] has little if any affinity at the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor.[14]
sumatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx ,  xxxd1976xxx  and frovatriptan display a micromolar affinity at the 5-ht7
receptor, which mediates smooth muscle relaxation.[1,23]
1.2 cardiovascular effects
1.2.1 systemic haemodynamics

human volunteer studies show that sumatriptan,[24,25]  xxxd3562xxx [26] and  xxxd3135xxx [27] slightly
increase arterial blood pressure (bp). this hypertensive response, which has little clinical relevance,
is probably related to peripheral vasoconstriction.
interestingly, in anaesthetised animals, high intravenous doses of sumatriptan,[28,29]  xxxd1976xxx [30] and  xxxd3135xxx [29] decrease bp, which appears to be
due to reduction of sympathetic outflow. it is known

that hypotension can be mediated via an agonist
action at  xxxg1110xxx  and/or 5-ht1a receptors.[29,31,32]
1.2.2 carotid haemodynamics

sumatriptan increases internal carotid and middle
cerebral artery blood flow velocity in patients with
migraine.[33-35] although this is yet to be established, on the basis of similar pharmacological
properties, other triptans are likely to have comparable effects. this effect is probably caused by constriction of intracranial arteries, consistent with
findings in animal models (see section 1.2.3).
as shown in table ii,[17,19,28,30,36-40] sumatriptan
and the other triptans decrease carotid artery blood
flow in anaesthetised animals. the apparent rank
order of agonist potency in decreasing canine carotid blood flow was as follows [with dose eliciting
50% effect (ed50) in mug/kg], intravenously administered frovatriptan (0.4)[39] >  xxxd3562xxx  (2.3)[36]
>  xxxd1976xxx  (12)[38] = naratriptan (19)[17] ≥  xxxd3135xxx  (30)[37] = sumatriptan (39).[17] almotriptan[19]

potently reduces carotid blood flow in the cat. using intracarotid administration of radiolabelled
microspheres, it has also been shown that the carotid
vasoconstriction by sumatriptan,[28,41]  xxxd3562xxx [36] and  xxxd1976xxx [30] is confined to arteriovenous
anastomoses, which may dilate during migraine
headaches.[42,43] similarly, sumatriptan (infused
into the brachial artery) is able to decrease human
forearm blood flow by a selective vasoconstrictor
action on arteriovenous anastomoses.[44] the extracerebral blood flow increases in response to 5ht1b/1d receptor agonists,[28,30,41] although with
 xxxd3562xxx  a decrease has been reported.[36] interestingly, cerebral blood flow does not seem to be affected by triptans, as shown with sumatriptan[28,41]
and even with the much more lipophilic, brain-penetrant compounds  xxxd3562xxx ,[36]  xxxd1976xxx [30]
and  xxxd3135xxx .[40]
1.2.3 constriction of isolated blood vessels

as shown in table iii, a number of isolated
blood vessels from several species contract in response to triptans.[16,17,19,20,45-54] this effect is
more marked on cranial vessels where, unlike in
most peripheral arteries, 5-ht1b rather than 5-ht2
receptors are predominant.[55,56] all compounds
resemble sumatriptan in their action and potency,
but naratriptan appears to be more efficacious
[higher maximum effect (emax)] than sumatriptan
in the canine basilar artery.[17] moreover,  xxxd1976xxx 
seems to behave as a partial agonist in the dog saphenous vein,[51] whereas  xxxd3562xxx  shows a
somewhat lower maximal contraction in the rabbit
saphenous vein than sumatriptan.[16]

1.2.4 coronary vascular effects

in the human coronary artery, 5-ht2 receptors
are more important in mediating vasoconstriction,
but about 20 to 30% response is mediated by 5-ht1
receptors.[55,56] accordingly, sumatriptan moderately constricts the human coronary artery, both in
vivo[24] and in vitro (table iii). other triptans for
which data are available are slightly more potent
(except  xxxd1976xxx ), but show similar efficacy (fig.
2a and b).[45,49,50,53] figure 2c[49,50,53] presents the
ratio between the unbound peak plasma concentration (cmax) after administration of clinically effective doses and the ec50 value of the compounds in
contracting the human isolated coronary artery. a
cmax/ec50 ratio of 1 indicates that the drug (active
metabolite excluded)[53] would elicit 50% of its
emax in a clinical situation. since in each case the
cmax/ec50 ratio is well below 0.4 ( xxxd3562xxx  and
 xxxd1976xxx  even below 0.05), the triptans are expected to cause only a little coronary constriction
at therapeutic doses in patients with migraine without any coronary artery disorder. however, in patients with coronary artery disease (stenosis or
hyperreactivity), the second generation triptans
may still cause myocardial ischaemia (for details
see maassenvandenbrink et al.[53]).
1.3 inhibitory effects on the
trigeminovascular system
1.3.1 peripheral trigeminal neuronal inhibition

as shown in table iv,[16,17,19,38,57-65] the triptans
(although this has yet to be established for

ineffective in  xxxg1109xxx  knockout mice, this
effect seems to involve the  xxxg1109xxx .[66]
similarly, this receptor mediates the effects of
sumatriptan in the guinea-pig dura mater,[66,67]
where the  xxxg1112xxx [68,69] as well as a novel[66,67]
receptor also play an important role. in the rat, the
inhibition of plasma protein extravasation involves
non-5-ht1b receptors, possibly  xxxg1110xxx  receptors
and/or another cp-122288–sensitive receptor.[57]
importantly, it should be noted that inhibition of
plasma protein extravasation alone is not consistent with  xxxd2022xxx  activity, since cp-122288
(in doses devoid of vasoconstrictor effect) was ineffective in migraine.[70] moreover, may et al.[71]
recently questioned the involvement of plasma extravasation in migraine, mainly on the basis of the
lack of retinal permeability changes during migraine attacks.
sumatriptan[59] and  xxxd3562xxx [60] have been
shown to inhibit neuropeptide release (mainly calcitonin gene-related peptide; cgrp) elicited by trigeminal ganglion stimulation. moreover, sumatriptan and  xxxd3135xxx , but not cp-122288, inhibit
neurogenically induced dural vasodilatation, an effect which, at least in rats, seems to be mediated by
the  xxxg1109xxx .[57]

1.3.2 central trigeminal neuronal inhibition

more recently, goadsby and colleagues have
shown that intravenous administration of  xxxd3562xxx [62] as well as naratriptan[64] inhibits action
potentials generated in the trigeminal nucleus
caudalis after superior sagittal sinus stimulation in
cats. similarly, in rats, intravenous  xxxd3135xxx  inhibits such potentials evoked by dural stimulation.[65] thus, these drugs exhibit a central inhibitory effect within the trigeminal system, which
may partly contribute to their therapeutic effect in
migraine. however, because of its poor central
penetration, intravenous sumatriptan did not affect
c-fos mrna expression in the trigeminal nucleus
caudalis following trigeminal ganglion stimulation
in rats.[61] this raises the question whether central
trigeminal inhibition is predictive of  xxxd2022xxx 
potential. on the other hand, it remains to be clarified whether during migraine headaches the bloodbrain barrier is partly disrupted. indeed, after disruption of the blood-brain barrier by infusion of
hyperosmolar mannitol, sumatriptan did inhibit cfos mrna expression.[61]
the central trigeminal inhibitory effects of naratriptan in the cat, being susceptible to blockade by
gr-127935, are mediated by 5-ht1b/1d recepdrugs 2000 dec; 60 (6)

tors.[64] since  xxxd2419xxx  displaced  xxxd3562xxx 
from its binding sites in the cat brain stem, the
involvement of  xxxg1110xxx  receptors is likely.[72] also,
in rats, the central trigeminal antinociceptive action by  xxxd3562xxx  is mediated by  xxxg1110xxx  but not
5-ht1b receptors.[63]

and inhibition of impulse transmission centrally
within the trigeminovascular system.[74,75] in our
view, the main action of triptans in migraine is to
constrict dilated cranial extracerebral blood vessels, most likely via 5-ht1b receptors.[3,76-78] thus,
in one study,[33] during migraine attacks the middle
cerebral artery was found dilated on the headache
side, and this was reversed by intravenous
sumatriptan. in 2 other studies,[34,35] an increase in
middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity was observed after administration of subcutaneous
sumatriptan during migraine attacks, although not
correlated to the efficacy on migraine pain in one
of the studies.[35] in addition, the triptans can reduce neuropeptide release and plasma protein
extravasation across dural vessels[73] and inhibit
impulse transmission centrally within the trigeminovascular system.[74,79] however, the possible
contribution of the neuronal effect of triptans mediated via the  xxxg1110xxx  has been put in
doubt because pnu-142633f, a selective  xxxg1110xxx 
receptor agonist, has not proved ineffective in the
treatment of migraine.[80]

tients with migraine (table v).[27,81-98] subcutaneous sumatriptan (6mg) is quickly absorbed, with a
time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of
approximately 10 minutes and an average bioavailability of 96%.[81,82] after oral administration of
therapeutic doses (100mg) of sumatriptan, however, the tmax is substantially longer (1.5h) and,
more importantly, the bioavailability is rather low
(≈14%).[81,83] intranasal or rectal administration of
sumatriptan does not seem to improve these parameters much.[82,84,99] the oral bioavailability of
newer triptans, especially naratriptan and almotriptan, is much improved. this can be partly attributed to the more lipophilic nature of these drugs.
interestingly, the tmax after oral administration of
 xxxd3562xxx ,[100,101] naratriptan,[87,88]  xxxd1976xxx ,[91-93]
almotriptan[94,95] and frovatriptan[97] is not similar
to or longer than that of sumatriptan, whereas  xxxd3135xxx [27,90] seems to reach cmax more quickly than
sumatriptan. the faster oral absorption of  xxxd3135xxx  than sumatriptan is supported by a comparative
study where the median tmax was 1.3 (range 1 to 3)
hours for  xxxd3135xxx  and 2.5 (range 1 to 4) hours (p
< 0.001) for sumatriptan.[27] it may be noted that
the unbound cmax values (cmax corrected for plasma protein binding) of newer triptans are lower than
that of sumatriptan. this is apparently due to 2
drugs 2000 dec; 60 (6)

triptans in migraine

main factors: lower therapeutic concentrations are
needed, as these drugs have a higher affinity at 5ht1b/1d receptors (see table i), and these drugs
have been better titrated.
with the exception of  xxxd3135xxx , the newer
triptans are degraded more slowly than sumatriptan. frovatriptan, particularly, has a plasma halflife (t1⁄2) of 26 to 30 hours,[97] and, in view of the
putative relationship of this parameter with headache recurrence, the results of clinical trials comparing sumatriptan and frovatriptan are awaited
with interest. in contrast to sumatriptan and naratriptan, active metabolites have been reported for
 xxxd3562xxx ,[101]  xxxd3135xxx [89] and  xxxd1976xxx .[92] it
is not known whether, and if so, to what extent, the
metabolites contribute towards therapeutic activity. we are not aware of whether the metabolism of
almotriptan or frovatriptan results in the formation
of active metabolites.
the possible interaction of triptans with drugs
used for migraine prophylaxis or drugs likely to be
coadministered with a  xxxd3263xxx  in the treatment of
migraine attacks has mainly been investigated in
healthy volunteers. the pharmacokinetic profile of
sumatriptan was not influenced by concomitant administration of propranolol, pizotifen,  xxxd2125xxx ,
dihydroergotamine, paroxetine, butorphanol or
naratriptan.[9]
there were no clinically significant changes in
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3562xxx  after concomitant administration of dihydroergotamine,
propranolol, pizotifen, fluoxetine, metoclopramide
or paracetamol (acetaminophen).[102] the pharmacokinetic parameters of naratriptan were not influenced significantly by coadministration of ergotamine[103] and dihydroergotamine.[104] the mean
plasma concentrations of  xxxd3135xxx  were increased
by 70% by administration of a high dose of propranolol,[105] but this interaction appears to be unique
to propranolol, because  xxxd2689xxx  and metoprolol
had no such effect on plasma concentrations of
 xxxd3135xxx .[105] as a safety precaution,  xxxd3135xxx 
5mg is recommended for patients taking propranolol. paroxetine did not affect the plasma concentrations of  xxxd3135xxx .[105,106]  xxxd3135xxx  did not

and  xxxd2751xxx  ( xxxd2751xxx ) [oral contraceptive pills].[105] in contrast, administration of the
monoamine oxidase (mao)-a selective inhibitor
moclobemide increased plasma concentrations of
sumatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx  and  xxxd3135xxx .[9,102,105]
4. efficacy in the acute treatment
of migraine
ideally, to define their place in migraine therapy
according to evidence-based medicine, all triptans
and administration forms of triptans should be
compared in recommended doses in placebo-controlled rcts, and all triptans in different administration forms should be compared with relevant alternative standard treatments. we identified a total
of 83 double-blind, rcts (many not yet published
in full) with a  xxxd3263xxx . so far, however, only 15
rcts comparing the second generation triptans
( xxxd3562xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd1976xxx  and
almotriptan) with oral sumatriptan, and  xxxd3135xxx 
with naratriptan and  xxxd3562xxx , have been performed (table vi),[107-121] and triptans have been
compared with other drugs in only 11 rcts (table
vii).[122-132] in addition to comparative rcts, one
must therefore also search for information about
the relative efficacy of the different triptans and
administration forms of triptans from trials with a
placebo control. in the following sections we review results from rcts with a placebo control,
from comparative trials with triptans, and from trials comparing a  xxxd3263xxx  with other drugs.
 xxxd234xxx  with triptans in current randomised clinical trials is defined as a decrease from
an initial moderate or severe headache to none or
mild[6] after a certain time (1, 2 or 4 hours). we
consider here as primary responses for active drugs
and placebo only the response rates at 1 hour after
injections and at 2 hours after other routes of administration. four-hour response rates are generally disregarded, since it is not, in our opinion, satisfactory to ask patients to wait 4 hours for an effect
on migraine headache. these response rates vary
considerably in different trials, for example from
56 to 88% at 1 hour after subcutaneous suma© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

 xxxd3263xxx ,[133] most likely because of a variable placebo response. therefore, the results of the trials
are given as the therapeutic gain (percentage response for active drug minus percentage response
for placebo) with 95% confidence intervals (ci). in
comparative trials the results are also given as differences with 95% ci.
5. efficacy compared with placebo

5.1 sumatriptan
5.1.1 subcutaneous sumatriptan

subcutaneous sumatriptan has a reasonably
well defined dose-response curve, with 1mg being
the minimum effective dose and 6mg being the
optimum dose, and with no benefit in increasing to
8mg.[4] subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg has been
evaluated against placebo in 13 double-blind,
placebo-controlled rcts[129,134-145] where  xxxd234xxx  was reported after 1 hour. as shown in
figure 3, subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg [based on
2108 patients treated with sumatriptan (headache
relief in 70%) and 1307 patients treated with placebo ( xxxd234xxx  in 19%)] has a mean therapeutic gain of 51% (95% ci 48 to 53%) after 1
hour.[133] after 2 hours in 10 of these trials, the
therapeutic gain was the same [52% (95% ci 40 to
56%)] as after 1 hour (tfelt-hansen, personal observation), indicating that the response to subcutaneous sumatriptan should be evaluated after 1
hour. in 2 trials with subcutaneous sumatriptan
in which  xxxd234xxx  was reported after 11⁄2
hours,[146,147] the mean therapeutic gain was 45%
(95% ci 34 to 56%). sumatriptan 6mg was superior to placebo in producing  xxxd234xxx  after
10 minutes, the first time point recorded.[133]
in 11 of these trials, the incidence of adverse
events reported was 64% (930/1456) after sumatriptan and 31% (290/890) after placebo. there
were thus 33% (95% ci 29 to 37%) more adverse
events after subcutaneous sumatriptan than after
placebo. most of these adverse events were, however, mild to moderate and short lasting.

in 1 placebo-controlled trial,[145] subcutaneous
sumatriptan has also been shown to reduce productivity loss during a migraine attack.
5.1.2 oral sumatriptan

the lower part of the dose-response curve for
oral sumatriptan was until recently[148] not well established.[4] the minimum effective dose of sumatriptan was 25mg[116,148] and the optimal dose 50
to 100mg; when the dose was increased to 200 to
300mg, there was no gain in efficacy, but more adverse events were reported.[4,149]
oral sumatriptan 100mg has been evaluated
against placebo in 20 double-blind, placebocontrolled rcts.[107,110,111,114,117,119,120,124,125,148-155]
oral sumatriptan 100mg [based on 2928 patients
treated with sumatriptan ( xxxd234xxx  in 59%)
and 1653 patients treated with placebo (headache
relief in 28%)] had a mean therapeutic gain of 32%
(95% ci 29 to 34%) after 2 hours (fig. 3). the
response rate of sumatriptan 100mg was superior
to that of placebo after 30 minutes.[133]
in 11 of these trials, the incidence of adverse
events reported was 40% (708/1786) after sumatriptan and 24% (270/1148) after placebo. there
were thus 16% (95% ci 13 to 19%) more adverse
events after oral sumatriptan 100mg than after placebo. most of these adverse events were, however,
mild and short lasting.
the lower doses of oral sumatriptan, 25 and
50mg, have been investigated only in 5 and 7 clinical trials, respectively. for sumatriptan 50mg
[based on 1599 patients treated with sumatriptan
( xxxd234xxx  in 59%) and 653 patients treated
with placebo ( xxxd234xxx  in 30%)], the mean
therapeutic gain was 29% (95% ci 25 to
33%).[116,119,148,152,153,156] thus, the therapeutic gain
was similar to that with sumatriptan 100mg (fig. 3).
in 2 direct comparative trials, the efficacy of the 2
doses of sumatriptan was quite comparable.[148,157]
the response rate with sumatriptan 50mg was superior to that of placebo at 30 minutes.[116,148,156]
the incidence of adverse events reported was 35%
(357/1034) after sumatriptan 50mg versus 32%
(164/509) after placebo (ns) between the
two.[116,148,152,153,156] in the 2 comparative tri© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

als[148,157] sumatriptan 50mg caused fewer adverse
events than sumatriptan 100mg.
the mean therapeutic gain for sumatriptan
25mg was 24% (95% ci 18 to 29%) [based on 1113
patients treated with sumatriptan ( xxxd234xxx 
in 56%) and 428 patients treated with placebo
( xxxd234xxx  in 32%); fig. 3].[116,148,152,153] in 2
direct comparative trials[148,157] sumatriptan 25mg
was found to be inferior to sumatriptan 50mg and
100mg. in 1 trial,[116] sumatriptan 25mg was superior to placebo after 30 minutes. after sumatriptan
25mg, 38% (273/714) of patients experienced the
same incidence of adverse events as after placebo
– 37% (132/353).
concerning oral sumatriptan, one can conclude
that the 50 and 100mg doses are equally efficacious
and are superior to the 25mg dose. fewer adverse
events are reported with the 25 and 50mg doses
than the 100mg dose, and no more adverse events
than placebo are seen with either of the lower
doses. based on these results, 50mg should be the
optimum dose of sumatriptan. even though 100mg
caused more adverse events than 50mg in 1 crossover trial,[157] almost the same percentage of patients (35 and 31%, respectively) preferred the 2

higher doses of sumatriptan, whereas only 21%
preferred the 25mg dose. this could be due to the
fact that more patients on 100mg than on 50mg
reported complete relief of pain.[157] some patients
seem to prefer a more effective dose and will endure the cost of more – transient and often mild –
adverse events.
5.1.3 intranasal sumatriptan

in randomised clinical trials the minimum effective dose of intranasal sumatriptan was 5mg;
10mg was also effective, but less so than 20mg.[9]
intranasal sumatriptan 20mg was the optimum
dose,[9] with no benefit in increasing the dose to
40mg.[9,158]
intranasal sumatriptan 20mg has been evaluated
against placebo in 7 trials.[158-162] intranasal sumatriptan 20mg [based on 1205 patients treated with
sumatriptan ( xxxd234xxx  in 61%) and 701 patients treated with placebo ( xxxd234xxx  in
31%)] had a mean therapeutic gain of 30% (95%
ci 25 to 34%) after 2 hours (fig. 3). intranasal sumatriptan 20mg was superior to placebo after 15
minutes.[133] there were 21% (95% ci 16 to 26%)
more adverse events reported with intranasal sudrugs 2000 dec; 60 (6)

ference in response (95% ci –0.2 to +19%)]. for
the second and third attacks treated, no superiority
of intranasal over oral sumatriptan could be demonstrated from 15 to 120 minutes, and oral sumatriptan was superior to intranasal sumatriptan after
4 hours (p < 0.01).

 xxxd3135xxx  (riza),  xxxd1976xxx  (ele), almotriptan (almo) and
frovatriptan (frova). all triptans were administered orally, except
for sumatriptan, where intranasal (in), rectal (pr) and subcutaneous (sc) routes were also used. for the number of patients
treated with each agent and placebo, see text. note that the
therapeutic gain was determined with most certainty for
sumatriptan 100mg, subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg and
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg (approximately 4500, 3000 and 3500 patients,
respectively).

matriptan 20mg than with placebo;[163] the most
common adverse event was taste disturbance.[158-162]
in 1 trial, 37% (73/200) of patients treated with
intranasal sumatriptan 20mg had  xxxd234xxx 
after 30 minutes (primary efficacy parameter), compared with 22% (45/207) of patients treated with
oral sumatriptan 100mg.[164] intranasal sumatriptan thus had a therapeutic gain over oral sumatriptan of 15% (95% ci 6 to 23%) after 30 minutes.
similar therapeutic superiority of intranasal sumatriptan was also found at 15 minutes, and at 45
and 60 minutes. after 4 hours, oral sumatriptan was
almost superior to intranasal sumatriptan [9% dif© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

two trials comparing the recommended 25mg
rectal dose of sumatriptan have been published.[165,166] in addition, 2 trials have been presented
as posters.[167,168] rectal sumatriptan 25mg [based
on 426 patients treated with sumatriptan (headache
relief in 70%) and 403 patients treated with placebo
( xxxd234xxx  in 39%)] had a mean therapeutic
gain of 31% (95% ci 25 to 37%) after 2 hours (fig.
3). rectal sumatriptan 25mg was significantly superior to placebo from 30[165] to 60 minutes.[166,167]
in these clinical trials,[165-167] the incidence of adverse
events reported was 25% (76/301) after sumatriptan versus 14% (24/171) after placebo. there were
thus 11% (95% ci 4 to 18%) more adverse events
with rectal sumatriptan 25mg than with placebo.
higher doses of 50 and 100mg did not increase the
efficacy compared with 25mg,[166] and 12.5mg can
be considered as the minimum effective dose.[165-168]
5.1.5 special randomised clinical trials

the question of whether a second dose of sumatriptan increases efficacy has been investigated
in 4 placebo-controlled clinical trials.[134,135,169,170]
in 2 trials, subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg or placebo was given 1 hour after the first dose of sumatriptan to patients without  xxxd234xxx . there
was no difference in headache response at 2 hours
between the 6mg plus 6mg of sumatriptan and the
6mg of sumatriptan plus placebo regimens.[134,135]
in 2 trials, patients initially took oral sumatriptan
100mg, which was followed at 2[169] or 4[170] hours
by either another dose of sumatriptan 100mg or
placebo in a double-blind fashion.  xxxd234xxx 
rates at 4[169] and 8[170] hours after the initial, nonblind dose of sumatriptan were 80 and 77% for the
100mg plus 100mg of sumatriptan group[169] and
85 and 84% for the 100mg of sumatriptan plus placebo group.[170] taken together, these 4 trials demonstrate that neither a second dose of sumatriptan

triptans in migraine

to patients not responding to the first dose nor the
routine use of a second dose increases the efficacy
of sumatriptan.
headache recurrence (significant worsening of
headache within 24 to 48 hours after an initial successful response at, for example, 2 hours) is a problem with all triptans and also with other acute migraine treatments (see tables vi and vii). with
sumatriptan, it occurs in 20 to 40% of primary successfully treated patients in controlled clinical trials. it is also a major problem in clinical practice;
about 75% of patients are reported to experience
headache recurrence in at least some attacks and up
to 40% in most of their attacks.[171]
oral sumatriptan has been evaluated for the prevention of recurrence by administering 100mg
2[169] or 4[170] hours after oral sumatriptan 100mg,
or 4 hours after subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg.[172]
in all 3 trials, the patients were first given nonblind
sumatriptan and then either sumatriptan 100mg or
placebo. in none of these studies did sumatriptan
100mg decrease the incidence of headache recurrence compared with placebo. prevention of recurrence with a second dose of sumatriptan is thus not
recommended.[169,170,172]
the efficacy of sumatriptan in treating recurrent
headache (after it has occurred) has been investigated in 3 trials.[169,170,173] in all 3 trials, sumatriptan was superior to placebo. oral sumatriptan
100mg seems to have the same efficacy in the treatment of headache recurrences [mean therapeutic
gain after 2 hours of 32% (95% ci 18 to 45%)][169]
as in the treatment of migraine attacks (see above
and fig. 3). in the second trial[170] with oral sumatriptan, the therapeutic gain was approximately
37% after 4 hours. in the third trial,[173] subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg had a 84% response rate compared with 50% for placebo for the first attack. the
therapeutic gain was thus 34% (95% ci 15 to
52%). in conclusion, a second dose of sumatriptan
is effective in the treatment of headache recurrence, as is a second dose of  xxxd3135xxx  (see section
5.4).
subcutaneous sumatriptan was compared with
placebo during the aura phase in 1 trial.[174] 88 pa© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

tients treated themselves with sumatriptan 6mg
and 83 patients received placebo during a typical
aura. the median duration of aura was 25 minutes
after sumatriptan and 30 minutes after placebo
(ns). the proportion of patients who developed a
moderate or severe headache after administration
of test drugs was similar in the 2 groups (68% after
sumatriptan and 75% after placebo). the reasons
for the lack of effect of sumatriptan administered
during the aura phase on the subsequent development of headache remain obscure.
5.2  xxxd3562xxx 

 xxxd3562xxx  has a well established doseresponse curve, with 1mg being the minimum effective dose and 2.5mg being the optimum dose.[175]
doses up to 25mg  xxxd3562xxx  have been evaluated[176-180] and generally no increase in efficacy
was observed above the 2.5 to 5mg dose but an
increase in adverse effects was noticeable.[175,176]
an exception is the high therapeutic gain of 58%
(95% ci 47 to 68%) for  xxxd3562xxx  20mg in 1
trial,[180] a result normally seen only after subcutaneous sumatriptan (fig. 3).
the recommended dose of  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg
has been compared with placebo in 3 trials.[109,177,179]
 xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg [based on 742 patients treated
with  xxxd3562xxx  ( xxxd234xxx  in 65%) and 367
patients treated with placebo ( xxxd234xxx  in
33%)] had a mean therapeutic gain of 32% (95%
ci 26 to 38%) after 2 hours (fig. 3). after 1 hour,
the mean therapeutic gain was 15% (95% ci 10 to
21%).[109,177,179]  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg was superior
to placebo after 1 hour in 2 trials.[109,179] in all 3
trials,[109,177,179] adverse events occurred in 43%
(341/802) of patients treated with  xxxd3562xxx  and
in 26% (102/393) of patients treated with placebo.
the use of  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg thus resulted in 17%
(95% ci 11 to 22%) more adverse events than placebo.
a recurrence rate of 22% after  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg
was reported in 1 trial,[177] and in another trial[109]
it was 29%. the overall recurrence rate in doseranging studies was 31% with  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg
or 5mg.[175]

5.3 naratriptan

oral naratriptan has been evaluated in a wide
dose range from 0.1 to 10mg,[110,111,181,182] with sumatriptan 100mg as control treatment in 2 trials[110,111] (see table vi). the minimum effective dose
was 1mg and naratriptan 2.5mg was chosen as the
dose resulting in no more adverse events than placebo.[183] higher oral doses of naratriptan 7.5 and
10mg were quite comparable in efficacy to 100mg
sumatriptan in 1 trial.[110,111]
oral naratriptan 2.5mg, the recommended dose,
has been evaluated against placebo in 5 trials.[110,111,113,181,182] naratriptan 2.5mg [based on
1223 patients treated with naratriptan (headache
relief in 48%) and 1019 patients treated with placebo ( xxxd234xxx  in 27%)] had a mean therapeutic gain of 22% (95% ci 18 to 26%) after 2
hours (fig. 3). escape medication could first be
taken after 4 hours, and at this time the mean therapeutic gain was 33% (95% ci 29 to 37%).[110,111,181,182]
naratriptan 2.5mg was superior to placebo in producing  xxxd234xxx  after 60 minutes.[113,183] recurrence rates for naratriptan 2.5mg were 17%,[181]
19%,[182] 21%,[110] 27%[111] and 28%.[113]
in 1 early, relatively small dose-ranging study
(see table vi), subcutaneous naratriptan in the dose
range of 0.5 to 10mg was compared with placebo
and subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg.[121] after 2
hours, all doses of naratriptan were superior to placebo, with response rates of 65% (0.5mg), 75%
(1mg), 83% (2.5mg), 94% (5mg) and 91% (10mg)
versus 41% for placebo. the response rate for sumatriptan was 89%. naratriptan 2.5mg (and higher
doses) was thus quite comparable to sumatriptan
6mg but, as shown by the wide 95% ci (see table
vi), the trial is too small to demonstrate comparability. the recurrence rates were 45% for sumatriptan and comparable to those with the lower doses
of naratriptan (38%, 0.5mg; 41%, 1mg; and 49%,
2.5mg), whereas the 5 and 10mg doses resulted in
lower, but not significantly different, recurrence
rates of 22 and 29%, respectively.

5.4  xxxd3135xxx 

the minimum effective dose for  xxxd3135xxx  is
5mg, with the optimum dose being 10mg.[105] a
dose of  xxxd3135xxx  2.5mg was ineffective,[184]
whereas the high 40mg dose had a therapeutic gain
of 49%,[114] but it caused too many adverse events
(83% of patients).
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled trials.[109,113,114,116,117,184-186]  xxxd3135xxx  10mg [based on 2470 patients treated with
 xxxd3135xxx  ( xxxd234xxx  in 69%) and 1097 patients treated with placebo ( xxxd234xxx  in
32%)] had a mean therapeutic gain of 37% (95%
ci 34 to 40%) after 2 hours (fig. 3).  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg was superior to placebo after 30 minutes
(tfelt-hansen personal observation).[116] in 6 of
these trials,[109,113,114,116,117,185] the incidence of adverse events reported was 42% (718/1705) after
 xxxd3135xxx  versus 27% (234/88120) after placebo.
there were thus 16% (95% ci 12 to 29%) more
adverse events after 10mg  xxxd3135xxx  than after
placebo.
the 5mg dose of  xxxd3135xxx , recommended for
use in patients on propranolol, has been evaluated
in 5 controlled trials.[115-117,184,185]  xxxd3135xxx  5mg
[based on 1397 patients treated with  xxxd3135xxx 
( xxxd234xxx  in 62%) and 749 patients treated
with placebo ( xxxd234xxx  in 34%)] had a mean
therapeutic gain of 28% (95% ci 23 to 32%) after
2 hours (fig. 3).  xxxd3135xxx  5mg was superior to
placebo after 30 minutes in 1 trial.[116] in 4 of these
trials,[115-117,185] the incidence of adverse events reported was 35% (448/1268) after  xxxd3135xxx  and
27% (188/686) after placebo. there were thus 8%
(95% ci 4 to 12%) more adverse events after  xxxd3135xxx  5mg than after placebo.
a rapidly dissolving wafer of  xxxd3135xxx  has been
compared with placebo in 2 trials (merck & co.
inc., data on file).[187]  xxxd3135xxx  10mg as a wafer
[based on 288 patients treated with  xxxd3135xxx 
( xxxd234xxx  in 70%) and 265 treated with placebo ( xxxd234xxx  in 34%)] had a mean therapeutic gain of 37% (95% ci 29 to 45%); the same
therapeutic gain as 10mg  xxxd3135xxx  tablets (see
above).  xxxd3135xxx  5mg as a wafer ( xxxd234xxx 
drugs 2000 dec; 60 (6)

triptans in migraine

in 62% of 271 patients) had a mean therapeutic
gain of 28% (95% ci 20 to 36%).  xxxd3135xxx  10mg
as a wafer was superior to placebo after 30 minutes
with a small therapeutic gain of 11% (95% ci 3 to
18%).[187]
in 1 trial,[185]  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was superior to
placebo in the treatment of headache recurrence
with a therapeutic gain of 38% (95% ci 23 to 52%)
after 2 hours, whereas  xxxd3135xxx  5mg was not significantly superior to placebo in the treatment of
recurrence.
5.5  xxxd1976xxx 

so far, no peer-reviewed paper on  xxxd1976xxx  has
been published. an early dose-finding study evaluating doses from 5 to 30mg  xxxd1976xxx  found only
minor difference from the placebo response.[188]
from 4 placebo-controlled trials,[118,119,132,189] the
mean therapeutic gain for  xxxd1976xxx  80mg [based
on 894 patients treated with  xxxd1976xxx  (response
rate 68%) and 524 patients treated with placebo
(response rate 25%)] was 42% (95% ci 37 to 47%)
after 2 hours (fig, 3). for  xxxd1976xxx  40mg, the mean
therapeutic gain was 37% (95% ci 32 to 42%) after
2 hours.[119,132,189] both the 40 and 80mg doses of
 xxxd1976xxx  were superior to placebo in producing
 xxxd234xxx  after 30 minutes.[189]
in the trial programme for  xxxd1976xxx , adverse
events were reported to occur in 50, 42 and 31% of
patients treated with  xxxd1976xxx  80 and 40mg and
placebo, respectively.[190] asthenia was the common adverse event occurring in 5% of patients
treated with  xxxd1976xxx  40mg and 10% of patients
treated with  xxxd1976xxx  80mg.[190]
5.6 almotriptan

no peer-reviewed papers on almotriptan have
been published. the first efficacy trial demonstrated that subcutaneous almotriptan 6 and 10mg
were superior to placebo.[191] a meta-analysis[192]
of placebo-controlled trials reported that the mean
therapeutic gain with almotriptan 12.5mg [based
on 719 on patients treated with almotriptan (response rate 61%) and 355 patients treated with placebo (response rate 35%)] was 26% (95% ci 20 to

32%). the mean therapeutic gain with almotriptan
25mg [based on 386 patients treated with almotriptan (response rate 63%) and 210 patients
treated with placebo (response rate 39%)] was 24%
(95% ci 16 to 33%) [fig. 3]. the 6.25mg dose of
almotriptan had a mean therapeutic gain of 20%
(95% ci 14 to 26%)[192] and was thus the minimum
effective dose. almotriptan 12.5mg was superior
to placebo after 30 minutes in 1 trial.[96] higher
doses up to 150mg almotriptan were not superior
to the 25mg dose.[193] the incidence of adverse
events was similar after almotriptan 12.5mg and
after placebo, whereas there were more adverse
events with almotriptan 25mg than placebo (odds
ratio versus placebo: 2.0).[192] a recurrence rate of
15% was reported in 1 trial.[120]
5.7 frovatriptan

based on only 2 placebo-controlled trials, published as abstracts,[194,195] the mean therapeutic
gain for frovatriptan 2.5mg [225 patients treated
with frovatriptan (response rate 40%) and 214 patients treated with placebo (response rate 24%)]
was 16% (95% ci 8 to 25%) after 2 hours (fig. 3).
higher doses up to frovatriptan 40mg were not superior to the 2.5mg dose[194] and lower doses were
not superior to placebo.[195] recurrence rates of
11%[194] and 14%[195] were reported for frovatriptan
2.5mg, but comparative trials are lacking.
5.8 other 5-ht1b/1d receptor agonists

avitriptan (bms-180048) 75mg had a mean
therapeutic gain of 22% (95% ci 9 to 36%) in 2
trials,[10,11] but the development programme for
avitriptan has been stopped because of hepatic toxicity.
subcutaneous alniditan, a non- xxxd3263xxx  5-ht1b/1d
receptor agonist, had a therapeutic gain of 45%
(95% ci 26 to 65%) at a dose of 1.4mg after 1 hour
in 1 trial.[13] a decrease in recurrence rate with increasing dose of alniditan was observed,[13] but as
alniditan did not result in fewer recurrences than
sumatriptan (jansen, data on file), the development
of alniditan was stopped.

5.9 consistency of response in
multiple attacks

in patients treating 3 migraine attacks with
sumatriptan 100 to 300mg, 47% responded to all 3
treatments compared with 8% responding to placebo
in all 3 attacks.[149] this trial was, however, not
designed to investigate consistency of response.
consistency of response to subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg was investigated in 120 patients treating 3 migraine attacks with sumatriptan and 1 attack with placebo in a double-blind, randomised
crossover trial.[147] relief rates were 78, 85, 84 and
84% at 60 minutes postdose for the first to fourth
attacks, indicating that the efficacy of sumatriptan
did not diminish with repeated use. 73% of patients
responded to all sumatriptan-treated attacks. in a
another double-blind, crossover trial, consistency
of response to sumatriptan 100mg was evaluated
by letting 154 migraine patients treat up to 9 attacks
with sumatriptan and up to 3 attacks with placebo.[155] patients were randomised to receive
sumatriptan or placebo in a 3 : 1 ratio for three 4attack blocks. the response to sumatriptan (49 to
50%; mean of 3 attacks) and placebo (16 to 20%)
was quite similar for each of the three 4-attack
blocks. in a subset of patients who treated 9 moderate or severe attacks, 62% experienced headache
relief in 7 of 9 attacks.
the consistency of the effect of  xxxd3135xxx  10mg
was investigated in 1 placebo-controlled trial[186]
in which 407 patients treated up to 4 attacks in a
special crossover design. the percentages of patients responding at 2 hours to  xxxd3135xxx  10mg
were consistent (75 to 80%) over the 4 attacks,
whereas the response to placebo varied somewhat
(28 to 54%). of the 315 patients who treated at least
3 migraine attacks with  xxxd3135xxx , 272 (86%) had
relief in at least 2 of the attacks.
apart from these 3 trials, consistency of response to a  xxxd3263xxx  has been claimed but not proven
in nonblind long term studies with sumatriptan,[196,197]  xxxd3562xxx ,[198] naratriptan,[199] and
 xxxd3135xxx ;[200] for discussion, see saxena & tfelthansen[75] and tfelt-hansen.[201]

6. comparative trials versus
other triptans
the second generation triptans ( xxxd3562xxx ,
naratriptan,  xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd1976xxx  and almotriptan)
have been compared with oral sumatriptan in 13
double-blind rcts and, in addition,  xxxd3135xxx  has
been compared with  xxxd3562xxx  and naratriptan
in 1 trial each (see table vi). furthermore, 1 trial
compared subcutaneous naratriptan, an administration form of naratriptan not developed for clinical
use, with subcutaneous sumatriptan[121] (table vi).
 xxxd3135xxx  40mg was superior to sumatriptan
100mg for success rate at 2 hours,[114] but this dose
was later reduced because of a high incidence of
adverse events.  xxxd1976xxx  80mg was superior to
sumatriptan 100mg[119] and 25 and 50mg,[119] in
most cases also for the clinically more relevant parameter of being pain free after 2 hours.[202]  xxxd1976xxx  40mg was superior[119] or comparable to
sumatriptan 100mg,[119] whereas this dose of  xxxd1976xxx  was not superior to sumatriptan 25 or 50mg
in 1 trial with a rather high placebo response of
40%.[119] for  xxxd3562xxx  5mg,[107]  xxxd3135xxx 
5[115,116] and 10mg,[116,117]  xxxd1976xxx  20mg,[119] and
almotriptan 12.5 and 25mg,[120] the results at 2
hours were similar to those with the comparative
sumatriptan dose (table vi).  xxxd3562xxx  5mg was
comparable to sumatriptan 50 and 100mg in 2 trials[107,108] and marginally better than sumatriptan
25mg in 1 trial[108] (table vi). the 2.5mg dose of
 xxxd3562xxx  was also marginally better than sumatriptan 25 and 50mg,[108] and it was comparable
to  xxxd3135xxx  10mg for  xxxd234xxx  but inferior
for being pain free in 1 trial[109] (table vi). naratriptan in oral doses of 7.5 and 10mg was comparable to sumatriptan 100mg.[110] however, the
2.5mg oral dose of naratriptan, which was chosen
for clinical use based on incidence of adverse
events being comparable to that with placebo,[183]
was inferior to sumatriptan 100mg in 3 trials for
the chosen primary efficacy parameter, headache
relief after 4 hours.[110-112] as would be expected,
naratriptan 2.5mg was inferior to  xxxd3135xxx  10mg
in 1 trial.[113] subcutaneous naratriptan in doses
drugs 2000 dec; 60 (6)

triptans in migraine

from 2.5 to 10mg was comparable to subcutaneous
sumatriptan 6mg.[121]
the recurrence rates for sumatriptan 100mg
varied considerably among trials (see table vi). in
1 trial[119] with generally extremely low recurrence
rates for all drugs it was as low as 6%. in patients
who were recurrence-prone, it was predictably high,
at 57%.[112] in the other 8 trials, the recurrence rates
for sumatriptan 100mg were between 27 and 44%.
this variability demonstrates that recurrence rates
for 2 drugs can be compared only in comparative
trials. apart from naratriptan, there are no consistent differences in recurrence rates between the
new triptans and sumatriptan (table vi). naratriptan 2.5mg resulted in fewer recurrences than
sumatriptan 100mg in 2 trials[110,111] and this was
also the case in patients with recurrence-prone migraine in 1 trial.[112] in addition, in 1 trial,[113] naratriptan 2.5mg resulted in fewer recurrences (21%)
than  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (33%). thus, even if there
are statistical concerns about comparing recurrence rates in 2 groups of patients responding to 2
different drugs,[203] these results strongly indicate
that the longer half-life of naratriptan compared
with sumatriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  (see table vi) results in fewer recurrences. however, this is not always the case, as illustrated by the high recurrence
rates after some of the subcutaneous naratriptan
doses[121] (table vi). that recurrence rates can also
depend on factors other than the half-lives of drugs
is indicated by the lower recurrence rates with ergot alkaloids than with triptans (see section 7); this
is most likely due to differences in the kinetics of
drug-receptor interaction.
on the basis of the more rapid absorption of
 xxxd3135xxx  compared with sumatriptan (see section
3), 2 trials[116,117] compared the speed of onset of
 xxxd234xxx  between oral  xxxd3135xxx  and oral
sumatriptan with time to  xxxd234xxx  analysis
up to 2 hours. one analysis[116] suggests that approximately 15% more patients are likely to achieve
 xxxd234xxx  within 2 hours after  xxxd3135xxx  5
and 10mg than after sumatriptan 25 and 50mg, respectively. in the other trial,[117] the sumatriptantreated group was marginally but significantly

older than the  xxxd3135xxx  group, and older age was
correlated with better response. after correction
for age imbalance, the results suggest that 21%
more patients are likely to achieve  xxxd234xxx 
within 2 hours after  xxxd3135xxx  10mg than sumatriptan 100mg.[117] more patients treated with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (40%) than with sumatriptan
100mg (33%) were pain free after 2 hours (table
vi). a post hoc analysis of the results suggests that
29% more patients are likely to be pain free within
2 hours after  xxxd3135xxx  10mg than after sumatriptan 100mg.
in addition,  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was compared
with  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg for time to being pain free
within 2 hours[109] and with naratriptan 2.5mg for
time to  xxxd234xxx  within 2 hours.[113]  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was more effective than the clinically
used low dose of naratriptan 2.5mg after 2 hours
(see section 5.3 and figure 3). therefore, as expected,
both analysis of time to  xxxd234xxx  (62% more
likely to be relieved with  xxxd3135xxx  than with naratriptan) and analysis of time to being pain free
(2.5 times more likely to be pain free with  xxxd3135xxx  than with naratriptan) demonstrated the superiority of  xxxd3135xxx  (p < 0.0001).[113] patients
treated with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg were 26% more
likely to be pain free within 2 hours than those
treated with  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg (p = 0.075).[109]
when analysed for time to sustained pain-free status through the 2-hour period, a pre-planned analysis, the difference became statistically significant
(p = 0.041). similar results were found for time to
 xxxd234xxx .[109] patients treated with  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg had a normal function at 2 hours significantly
more often (45%) than those treated with  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg (37%).[109]
7. comparative trials with drugs other
than triptans
sumatriptan, the first  xxxd3263xxx , is the only one that
has been compared with several standard treatments for migraine attacks. in addition,  xxxd1976xxx 
has been compared with ergotamine (ergotamine
tartrate) 2mg plus caffeine 200mg (ergotamine/
caffeine) in 1 clinical trial.[132] a brief summary of
drugs 2000 dec; 60 (6)

1280

these 11 randomised, double-blind clinical trials is
shown in table vii. oral sumatriptan 100mg was
superior to ergotamine/caffeine, with a quicker onset of action, but with more recurrences (41 vs
30%) within 48 hours.[122] sumatriptan 100mg was
not significantly superior to a combination of aspirin ( xxxd234xxx ) 900mg and metoclopramide 10mg for the first treated migraine attack, the
primary efficacy parameter, but was superior for
the second and third treated attacks, and for other
parameters.[123] a combination of a highly soluble
aspirin salt, lysine  xxxd234xxx  1620mg (equivalent to 900mg aspirin), and metoclopramide
10mg was equivalent to sumatriptan 100mg.[124]
diclofenac-potassium, 50 and 100mg, was equivalent to sumatriptan 100mg,[126] but the primary
efficacy parameter used – changes in head pain on
a visual analogue scale – makes it difficult to compare the results with those of other trials with
triptans. apparently, a rapidly soluble form of
tolfenamic acid, given in a dose of 200mg plus
200mg, was comparable to sumatriptan 100mg,[125]
but as demonstrated by the wide 95% ci (see table
vii), this finding needs confirmation in a larger
trial.
subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg was considerably superior to dihydroergotamine (dihydroergotamine mesylate) nasal spray (1mg + 1mg), with
superiority being already evident at 15 minutes.[127]
recurrence of headache occurred less often after
dihydroergotamine (17%) than after sumatriptan
(31%).[127] compared with subcutaneous dihydroergotamine (1mg + optional 1mg), subcutaneous
sumatriptan was superior for the first 2 hours, but
after 3 and 4 hours the effects of both treatments
were similar.[128] after dihydroergotamine there were
significantly fewer recurrences than after sumatriptan
(18 vs 45%). subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg was
superior to intravenous lysine  xxxd234xxx 
1800mg (corresponding to 1000mg aspirin).[129]
intranasal sumatriptan 20mg was superior to
intranasal dihydroergotamine (1mg + optional
1mg) from 45 to 120 minutes after administration,[130] but there were fewer recurrences after dihydroergotamine (13%) than after sumatriptan

(23%). rectal sumatriptan 25mg was inferior to the
ergotamine/caffeine suppositories (ergotamine
2mg plus caffeine 100mg) taken by two-thirds of
the patients twice within 30 minutes, and there
were fewer recurrences after ergotamine/caffeine
(11%) than after sumatriptan (22%).[131] however,
because of adverse events, 44% of patients preferred sumatriptan and 37% preferred ergotamine/
caffeine in this crossover study (ns). both  xxxd1976xxx  40 and 80mg were superior to ergotamine
2mg/caffeine 200mg and placebo.[132]
sumatriptan 100mg produced more adverse
events than aspirin plus metoclopramide[123] and
lysine  xxxd234xxx  plus metoclopramide,[124]
and more adverse events were seen with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg than intranasal dihydroergotamine (1mg + optional 1mg)[127] and intravenous lysine  xxxd234xxx .[129] rectal sumatriptan
25mg produced less nausea and/or vomiting than
ergotamine 2mg/caffeine 100mg suppositories[131]
(table vii). in most cases, the adverse events were
mild to moderate, but 1 case of atrial fibrillation after
sumatriptan 100mg necessitated hospitalisation.[124]
an interesting observation is that in all 5 trials[122,127,128,130,131] comparing sumatriptan with
either ergotamine or dihydroergotamine, the recurrence rate was lower after the ergot alkaloid than
after sumatriptan (table vii). a similar tendency
was observed for ergotamine versus  xxxd1976xxx .[132]
this is most probably because of the long duration
of the vascular effects of a single dose of an ergot
alkaloid.[204,205]
8. conclusions
second generation triptans do not seem to differ
much from sumatriptan in their pharmacodynamic
properties apart from being more lipophilic (see
table v), with a resultant potential effect on central
parts of the trigeminovascular system. however,
they show improved pharmacokinetics. thus, all
second generation triptans have a higher oral bioavailability than the 14% observed for sumatriptan
(table v). oral bioavailability is 46% for  xxxd3562xxx , 74% for naratriptan, 40% for  xxxd3135xxx ,
50% for  xxxd1976xxx , 80% for almotriptan and 30%
drugs 2000 dec; 60 (6)

triptans in migraine

for frovatriptan. oral  xxxd3135xxx  is absorbed more
quickly than oral sumatriptan, whereas the other
triptans are absorbed at the same rate as or more
slowly than sumatriptan. the half-life of the newer
triptans is either approximately comparable ( xxxd3562xxx  3 hours,  xxxd3135xxx  2 hours and almotriptan 3 hours) to the 2 hours for sumatriptan, or
longer (naratriptan 5.5 hours,  xxxd1976xxx  6 hours
and frovatriptan 30 hours).
do these relatively minor pharmacodynamic
and considerable pharmacokinetic differences compared with sumatriptan result in clinically relevant
increased efficacy compared with oral sumatriptan?
and what is the relative efficacy of the second generation triptans? to answer these questions definitively, a wide range of rcts comparing the triptans
is needed. so far, only 15 such comparative clinical
trials (13 trials involving a newer  xxxd3263xxx  and
sumatriptan) have been performed.
in addition to comparative trials, all triptans
have therefore been compared with placebo (also
in this review) by calculating mean therapeutic
gains for  xxxd234xxx  (fig. 3). however, this
kind of analysis should be used with caution, since
it is not based on randomisation of patients to treatments. in our view, only definitely outstanding results should be judged as most likely to be clinically relevant. this analysis thus indicates that,
with respect to  xxxd234xxx  at 2 hours,  xxxd1976xxx  80mg is superior to sumatriptan 100mg, and
that naratriptan 2.5mg and frovatriptan 2.5mg are
inferior to sumatriptan 100mg. all other triptans or
doses of oral triptans seem roughly equivalent to
sumatriptan 50 to 100mg. intranasal and rectal
sumatriptan seem equivalent to oral sumatriptan,
whereas subcutaneous sumatriptan is superior to
all clinically used oral doses of triptans (fig. 3).
a review of the relatively few comparative trials
(table vi) provides the same conclusions for  xxxd234xxx .  xxxd1976xxx  80mg is superior to sumatriptan 100mg, and naratriptan 2.5mg is inferior to
this dose of sumatriptan, whereas the other recommended oral doses of the second generation triptans are comparable to sumatriptan 100mg. no
comparative trial with frovatriptan has been pub© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

lished so far. apart from efficacy,  xxxd234xxx 
after 2 hours, speed of onset of action (a feature
highly valued by the patients[206]), and recurrence
or secondary treatment failure have been investigated in a few comparative trials. thus, patients
treated with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg are slightly more (15
to 26%) likely to achieve  xxxd234xxx  within 2
hours than patients treated with sumatriptan 50 or
100mg[116,117] or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg.[109] patients
treated with naratriptan 2.5mg had, in most studies,
fewer recurrences than those treated with sumatriptan 100mg (table vi).
finally, how do the triptans compare with nontriptan drugs? relatively few comparative trials,
some of them unpublished, have been performed
(table vii). oral sumatriptan 100mg and oral  xxxd1976xxx  40 and 80mg were superior to the widely
used oral ergotamine 2mg/caffeine 200mg. oral
sumatriptan 100mg was marginally better than or
comparable to the combination of metoclopramide
and aspirin, tolfenamic acid or diclofenac potassium. subcutaneous sumatriptan was superior to
intranasal dihydroergotamine and intravenous lysine  xxxd234xxx , and comparable to subcutaneous dihydroergotamine. intranasal sumatriptan
was superior to intranasal dihydroergotamine, and
rectal sumatriptan was marginally inferior to rectal
ergotamine. there is clearly a need for more comparative trials with the second generation triptans
and current non- xxxd3263xxx  drugs to definitively establish the place of triptans in migraine therapy.
