primapterinuria in this patient. however, accumulation of a 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin degradation

hyperphenylalaninemia, which can cause neurological disorders and mental retardation, results from
a mutation in  xxxg1660xxx  or an enzyme required for biosynthesis or regeneration of its
cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin. the hyperphenylalaninemia variant primapterinuria is characterized by
the excretion of 7-biopterin (primapterin). this disorder is thought to be due to a deficiency of 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase (pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase), but a lack of tissue activity has
not been directly demonstrated. the five mutations so
far recognized in patients with primapterinuria are
associated with either a single amino acid change or a
premature stop codon. only c81r has been successfully expressed in soluble form, and was found to have
40% of normal activity. tissues which could be obtained by minimally invasive procedures were analyzed for dehydratase activity. none was detected in
normal human white cells or fibroblasts. however,
activity was found in intestine of rat, dog, pig, and
particularly humans where it was only eight times
lower than in liver. distribution along the length and
across the wall of small intestine was relatively uniform. moreover, the dehydratases from human liver
and intestinal mucosa have identical kinetic properties. a biopsy of duodenal mucosa from a patient with
homozygous e96k dehydratase had activity of 55

the most common cause of hyperphenylalaninemia is a deficiency in  xxxg1660xxx 
which results in phenylketonuria (pku) and, if not
treated, severe mental retardation. less frequently,
hyperphenylalaninemia is due to deficiency in an
enzyme involved in tetrahydrobiopterin 2 biosynthesis or regeneration. tetrahydrobiopterin is an essential cofactor for phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylases (1) (fig. 1) and the no synthases
(2). the three aromatic amino acid hydroxylases
utilize tetrahydrobiopterin to activate molecular oxygen to produce tyrosine, dopa, and 5-hydroxytryptophan, respectively. tetrahydrobiopterin is regen2

erated from the cofactor product of the reaction,
4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin, by the successive
reactions catalyzed by 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase ( xxxg1676xxx ) (3,4) and  xxxg1912xxx  (1) (fig. 1). in a variant form of
hyperphenylalaninemia known as primapterinuria,
the plasma phenylalanine usually approaches normal levels by 2 years of age, but persistent high
levels of 7-biopterin as well as 7-neopterin and 6-keto-7-biopterin are excreted in the urine (5– 8) (fig.
2). it was hypothesized that this variant form could
be due to a deficiency of 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase. in support of this hypothesis, it
was shown that 7-pterins can be produced from tetrahydrobiopterin in a reaction of  xxxg1660xxx  in the absence of the dehydratase (9,10).
4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase is a
homotetramer with 103 amino acids in each subunit
(11,12). analysis of the dehydratase gene of a child
with the symptoms of this disorder revealed a point
mutation corresponding to c81r in one allele and a
termination mutation, e86x, in the other (13). to
determine the effect of these mutations on the catalytic activity of the dehydratase, c81r and e86x
were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli
(14,15). the c81r dehydratase was found to have
about 40% of the activity of the wild-type with no
change in k m (14 –16). when e86x was expressed
recombinantly, most of the protein was found in the
insoluble fraction so that activity could not be quantitatively determined (14,17). although some activity was detected (17), dehydratase with only the first
85 n-terminal amino acids would be expected to

have insignificant activity since it lacks r87 which
forms a salt link with e80 at the edge of the catalytic
site. even if the activity of e86x is insignificant, the
patient might be expected to have 20% of normal
activity from the c81r allele. however, recombinant
c81r was shown to be more susceptible than wildtype to proteolysis as determined by the rapid loss of
activity when incubated with trypsin or cathepsin
and by the rapid decrease in the dehydratase band
when analyzed by sds–page. it was suggested
that this decreased stability could result in decreased enzymatic activity in vivo, in addition to
that due to the direct effect of the mutation on catalytic activity (14).
to further test the hypothesis that hyperphenylalaninemia associated with high urinary levels of
7-biopterin was due to deficiency of 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase, the sequence of the
dehydratase gene from several other patients was
determined. mutations were found corresponding to
t78i, q97x (17), e96k, and e26x (18). the first
three of these, t78i, q97x, and e96k, were cloned
and expressed in e. coli. in all cases, the majority of
the dehydratase was found in the insoluble fraction.
enough q97x and e96k remained in the soluble
fraction to allow determination of dehydratase activity. the mutant dehydratase, e96k, was found to
have a k m for substrate identical to that of wild-type,
whereas the k m for substrate of q97x was only two
to three times higher. however, the amount of either
of these mutant dehydratases in the soluble fraction
was too small to allow purification and determination of specific catalytic activity (17,18).
since the actual level of dehydratase activity in
the tissues of these patients is unknown, these data
leave open the question of whether mutations in the
dehydratase are (i) the sole cause of the excretion of

evaluation of polymorphisms from intestinal biopsies

high levels of 7-pterins and transient hyperphenylalaninemia, or (ii) a contributing factor, or (iii) incidental polymorphisms. we have found that in addition to liver and kidney, there is significant
activity of 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase in the intestine. since intestinal biopsies are
routinely performed for diagnosis of gi disorders,
this presented a means of directly comparing dehydratase activity in the tissue of a patient with that
in controls.
materials and methods
materials. the dehydratase substrates, 6(r)-4ahydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin, 6(s)-propyl-4a-hydroxytetrahydropterin, and 6(s)-methyl-4a-hydroxy-tetrahydropterin, were stereospecifically synthesized as
described elsewhere (4,19). human liver dehydratase,
which has identical amino acid sequence to the enzyme from rat liver, and  xxxg1912xxx 
were purified as previously reported (20). a unit of
reductase is defined as the amount which reduces 1
␮mol of quinoid 6-methyl-dihydropterin per minute
with 10 ␮m quinoid 6-methyl-dihydropterin and 100
␮m nadh in 1 ml of 0.1 m tris–hcl, ph 7.4, at 27°c.
buffer solutions were made to give the desired ph at
the temperature utilized. cell culture medium (dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium, dmem) was from
gibco life technologies (rockville, md) (#12100). all
other reagents were from sigma (st. louis, mo).
animal tissues. anesthetized animals were perfused with 0.15 m nacl and tissues were removed
and washed with 0.15 m nacl. a section of small
intestine was taken from a pig and the mucosal
layer removed by lightly scraping with a metal spatula. from the dog, 2-inch segments of duodenum,
jejunum, and ileum were collected. the mucosal
layer was removed from a portion of each section,
and the remainder was stored intact. all tissues
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at ⫺80°c until extracted and analyzed.
human tissues. freshly prepared and washed
buffy coat was used as the source of human white
cells. the washed white cells were resuspended in
an equal volume of buffer and frozen in liquid nitrogen. human skin fibroblasts from a 6-month-old female were grown in dmem supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum. cells from 22 plates (approx. 10 8
cells) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline,
collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was
resuspended in 0.5 ml distilled water, and frozen in

181

liquid nitrogen. human liver and duodenum were
obtained from organ donors who were traffic accident victims. human ileum was obtained from a
patient undergoing ileostomy. biopsies of duodenal
mucosa were obtained by endoscopy as part of routine diagnostic procedures for gi disorders. a portion of the biopsy, 4 –12 mg, was frozen in liquid
nitrogen immediately upon removal.
patient. hyperphenylalaninemia was detected
in a patient (biodef #306) (21,22) in a newborn
screening test. his urine was found to contain high
levels of 7-biopterin (0.8 mmol/mol creatinine compared to 0.02– 0.058 in controls). sequencing of the
gene revealed a mutation corresponding to e96k,
which has previously been reported in another unrelated patient (biodef #216) (18). as mentioned
above, when cloned and expressed most of the mutant dehydratase was in the insoluble fraction. some
activity was detected in the 100,000-g supernatant
but at a level which was too low to allow quantitative evaluation, except for the determination of k m,
which was found to be the same as wild-type (18).
the tissue analyzed in the current work was a biopsy of duodenal mucosa obtained from patient biodef #306 at 2 years of age.
extraction of tissues. tissues were homogenized
in a potter–elvehjem homogenizer on ice in 2 ml
activity assay buffer per gram tissue. all samples of
complete cross sections of intestine, and other fibrous tissues, were first pulverized under liquid nitrogen to facilitate homogenization. human fibroblasts and human white cells were homogenized by
hand in a microground glass homogenizer. homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000g for 60 min at
4°c and the supernatants used as the source of
dehydratase. biopsies of human intestine mucosa
were weighed in kontes homogenization microfuge
tubes while still frozen, 125 ␮l of activity assay
buffer was added, and the tissues were homogenized
by hand on ice. homogenates were spun at 4°c in a
microfuge at 15,000g for 30 min. from the supernatant 10 ␮l was taken for determination of protein
(23), and 100 ␮l was immediately analyzed for dehydrates activity.
measurement of dehydratase activity. activity
was measured using chemically synthesized substrate (19) by a procedure which we have published
(4,20). reaction mixtures were assembled in a water-jacketed 1 cm light-path microcuvet through
which cold water was circulated to maintain the
cuvet contents  xxxd1891xxx °c. temperature was deter-

mined with a yellow springs instrument (yellow
springs, oh) model 729 temperature probe inserted
into the reaction mixture. standard reactions were
run in 25 mm tris–hcl, ph 8.4 (or ph 7.4 where
noted),  xxxd1891xxx °c, and contained nadh (0.1 mm) and
an excess of  xxxg1912xxx  (0.5 units).
after addition of a 100,000g supernatant of homogenate as the source of dehydratase, the reaction was
monitored at 340 nm for any nonspecific oxidation of
nadh. when a stable baseline was reached (typically 2–5 min), the dehydratase reaction was initiated by addition of 7.5 ␮l of 2 mm 6(s)-propyl-4ahydroxy-tetrahydropterin substrate to a total
reaction volume of 1 ml. the accuracy of the initial
substrate concentration is not critical since reactions are run to completion and kinetic parameters
are determined by analysis of the complete progress
curve. data were acquired by computer at 2 points/s
and the reaction velocity and k m calculated as previously published (20,24). the nonenzymatic rate of
dehydration under these conditions is 0.0022 s ⫺1 and
is taken into account in the calculations.
measurements of activity in biopsies of duodenal
mucosa from children were made in 10 mm tris–
hcl, ph 8.2, in order to obtain the highest ratio of
enzymatic to nonenzymatic rate, and thereby increase sensitivity. under these conditions the enzymatic rate is 14% faster and the nonenzymatic rate
15% slower than in 25 mm tris–hcl, ph 8.4. the
sensitivity was further increased by masking the
cuvet so that reactions could be run in a total volume
of 0.28 ml, in this case initiated with 2.2 ␮l of 2 mm
substrate. each biopsy was analyzed at least three
times. during the reaction, the product quinoid dihydropterin is immediately reduced by nadh and
 xxxg1912xxx  to tetrahydropterin,
which does not interfere with the dehydratase (20).
thus, when sample is limited, repeat assays can be
performed in the same reaction mixture by running
the reaction to completion and then repeating the
addition of nadh and substrate to initiate a new
reaction.
results
evaluation of human white blood cells and human
skin fibroblasts for dehydratase activity. human
white cells were analyzed for dehydratase activity
with extract of white cells from 5 ml up to 50 ml of
blood added to the reaction. no dehydratase activity
was detected even at the highest amount added.
similar analyses were performed with extracts from

from 10 7 cells (0.2 mg protein) to 4 ⫻ 10 7 cells (0.8
mg protein) in a 1-ml reaction. again, no dehydratase activity could be detected.
distribution of dehydratase activity in rat tissues.
initial experiments to determine tissue distribution
of dehydratase were conducted in rat. rat dehydratase has the identical amino acid sequence to the
human enzyme. in order to ascertain the validity of
measurements of dehydratase activity in crude
100,000-g supernatants, the relationship between
amount of tissue extract in the reaction and dehydratase activity was determined. in all cases a linear relationship between v max and milligram wet
weight of tissue was observed over the range measured (fig. 3), indicating the lack of any significant
inhibition by endogenous compounds. from these
rates the concentration of dehydratase in different
tissues was calculated based on the turnover values
(micromoles product formed per micromole enzyme
per minute) which we have previously established
for homogeneously pure rat liver dehydratase under
similar activity assay conditions (20). the levels of
dehydratase in different rat tissues are summarized
in table 1. the relative activities in liver, kidney,
pancreas, and lung are consistent with those previously reported (25). in addition, we also found dehydratase in rat intestine. the activity in a sampling of
total rat small intestine is higher than in all other
tissues except for liver and kidney. immunohisto-

chemical techniques have detected dehydratase containing cells throughout the various layers of the rat
intestine (26).
dehydratase activity in the intestine of other species and in different sections of the intestine. to
ascertain whether dehydratase activity in the intestine is specific for rats or is a more general phenomenon, samples of intestine were obtained from dog
and pig. activity was found in the small intestine of
both species. the distribution of dehydratase activity along the intestine and across the intestinal wall
was determined in dog tissues. enzymatic activity
was found to be similar in jejunum, duodenum, and
ileum. interestingly, in all three sections the activity
in the mucosa is similar to that in the underlying
tissue (table 2). the k m for substrate, 6(s)-propyl4a-hydroxy-tetrahydropterin, determined with dog
and pig mucosa was found to be the same as for rat
and human enzyme (see below). assuming that the
turnover (micromoles product formed per micromole
enzyme per minute) is also the same as for rat and

characterization of human intestine dehydratase.
dehydratase activity in human intestine was measured with different volumes of intestine extract. a
linear relationship between activity and volume of
extract was observed (fig. 4). the concentration of
dehydratase in human intestine calculated from the
data in fig. 4 is 0.88 ␮m. the same result was
obtained whether the extract was from ileum removed at surgery or was duodenal mucosa removed
from an organ donor. similar experiments with human liver gave a concentration of dehydratase in
human liver of 7.2 ␮m (n ⫽ 4).
dehydratase in human intestine extracts was
characterized kinetically and compared with purified human liver enzyme. the relative activity of
intestine dehydratase with three different substrates, 6(s)-methyl-4a-hydroxy-tetrahydropterin,
6(s)-propyl-4a-hydroxy-tetrahydropterin, and 6(r)4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin, was the same as
that observed for the liver enzyme, as was the ratio
of v max at ph 7.4 to v max at ph 8.4. the k m for
substrate with the intestine enzyme was also the
same as with the liver enzyme (table 3). thus, it
appears that the dehydratase in the intestine is the
same as the liver enzyme and therefore can be used
as a source of dehydratase for evaluating the effect
of mutations on the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
dehydratase activity in intestine biopsies from
children. duodenal mucosa biopsies were obtained
by endoscopy from 12 children as part of routine
diagnostic procedures for gi disorders. these samples were used to determine the extent of variability

among children. each biopsy was analyzed with at
least three progress curves, with an average intraassay standard deviation of ⫾4%. as can be seen from
the results (table 4, fig. 5), there is very little variation among children from 1 to 14 years of age. the

the dehydratase in human duodenal mucosa appears to have the same properties as that in liver
(table 3, see above). therefore, the activity was
measured in a biopsy of duodenal mucosa obtained
from a patient with a homozygous dehydratase mutation (e96k). since the activity found in the biopsies from the 12 control children is very uniform

evaluation of polymorphisms from intestinal biopsies

in duodenal biopsies of 12 control children and a child homozygous for an e96k mutation in his dehydratase. activities, nanomoles product formed per minute are (a) per gram tissue, and (b)
per milligram protein. the activity in each sample was measured
at least three times. activities are plotted as the average ⫾ sd.

were being diagnosed (table 4, fig. 5), the male
patient (who was 2 years of age at the time the
biopsy was taken) can be compared to their average
value. as can be seen from table 4 and fig. 5, the
dehydratase activity in duodenal mucosa of the patient with the homozygous e96k mutation is about
17% of that found in controls based on milligram wet
weight of tissue and 17.6% based on activity per
milligram protein. the k m of the dehydratase from
the e96k patient was found to be the same as for
controls, consistent with the value determined with
the poorly soluble recombinant e96k dehydratase
expressed in e. coli (18).
discussion
the small intestine of different species was found
to contain significant amounts of dehydratase activity with relatively uniform distribution of activity
along the length and across the wall of the intestine.
human small intestine mucosa dehydratase was
found to have identical kinetic properties to the liver
enzyme. furthermore, dehydratase activity in duodenal mucosa biopsies did not vary greatly among

185

controls. therefore, intestinal mucosa appears to be
a suitable tissue for assessing the dehydratase status of an individual.
using duodenal mucosa biopsies, a patient homozygous for the dehydratase variant, e96k, was
found to possess tissue activity levels of about onesixth of normal. glutamate 96 is not within the
catalytic site, but it forms an ionic bond with  xxxg416xxx  on
an adjacent ␤-sheet in the same subunit. disruption
of this bond could affect activity either directly or by
a change of conformation. consistent with the latter
possibility is the inability to express e96k in soluble
form in e. coli (18), in contrast to wild-type dehydratase which remains soluble even at a level of
expression equivalent to 30% of the total soluble
protein of e. coli (24).
the activity of another dehydratase mutation,
c81r, was measured in vitro and found to contain
40% of normal activity (14 –16). considering this
level of activity, plus the assumption that an e86x
mutation would produce inactive dehydratase, it
was calculated that a patient with a compound heterozygous mutation, c81r/e86x, would have 20% of
normal activity. since this level of activity was
deemed insufficient to cause the biochemical symptoms of this patient, it was proposed that tissue
levels might be further decreased by twofold or more
due to a higher than normal susceptibility of c81r
to proteolysis (14). however, the results presented
here, which for the first time measure the actual
tissue activity of a mutant dehydratase, demonstrate that a patient with primapterinuria has 17%
of the normal level.
the majority of tetrahydrobiopterin utilization is
in the liver as cofacator for  xxxg1660xxx  in the catabolism of phenylalanine. we have
shown that dehydratase activity in rat liver is sufficient to maintain 99% of tetrahydrobiopterin in the
reduced form, even during a phenylalanine load (4).
a similar conclusion can be made for normal human
liver, since although dehydratase in human liver is
somewhat lower than in rat,  xxxg1660xxx  activity is also lower (27). 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin that is not either enzymatically or
spontaneously dehydrated (19) can degrade by
at least two routes: formation of  xxxd3166xxx  (presumably via 7-quinoid dihydrobiopterin)
(9,10,19), and formation of a side-chain 4a-cyclic
adduct of tetrahydrobiopterin (fig. 6) (19,20). except in the extreme case where the steady-state concentration of 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin approaches k m for the dehydratase (⬍3 ␮m, [20]), a

fig. 6. 4a-cyclic adduct produced from 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin by displacement of the 4a-hydroxyl group, (a) by the
2⬘-hydroxyl of the 6 substituent (19,20), or (b) by the 1⬘-hydroxyl
of the 6-substituent. preliminary data were consistent with structure (a) (19,20), but we have since shown that 6-hydroxymethyl4a-hydroxy-tetrahydropterin can form an analogous adduct.
therefore, structure (b) cannot be excluded.

simple analysis suggests that the rate of 7-biopterin
production would depend linearly on the level of
dehydratase activity (assuming that the rate constant of the decomposition pathways are unchanged
in the patient). thus, one would expect a 6-fold
increase in 7-biopterin excretion in the patient with
the e96k mutation. instead, a 13- to 40-fold increase is observed: 0.8 mmol/mol creatinine in the
patient compared to 0.02 to 0.058 mmol/mol creatinine in controls (17,28).
the difference between the expected and observed
excretion of 7-biopterin into the urine might be accounted for by the action of the side-chain 4a-cyclic
adduct of tetrahydrobiopterin. the dehydratase
binds the cyclic adduct and converts this to quinoid
dihydrobiopterin, but at a rate more than 50-fold
slower than that of 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin
(19,20). preliminary data suggest that the cyclic adduct has an affinity similar to that of 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin. dehydratase progress curves
with 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin as substrate
show that an inhibitor is produced in vitro as the
reaction proceeds. a decrease in dehydratase activity due to a mutation would cause accumulation of
the cyclic adduct, which is about 10 times more
stable than 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin (19,20).
this will further inhibit the dehydratase, reinforcing not only its own production, but also that of
7-pterins. thus, the effect of the mutation would be
compounded. the influence of the cyclic adduct on
the analysis of dehydratase activity in biopsy samples would be minimal, since if any remained after
homogenization and centrifugation, it would be diluted at least 100-fold in the activity assay. the
dehydratase mutation, and the inhibition of the remaining dehydratase activity in the liver by the
4a-cyclic adduct of tetrahydrobiopterin, may be suf-

ficient to account for the biochemical symptoms of
these patients.
patients with primapterinuria typically excrete
about half of the biopterin as 6-biopterin and half as
7-biopterin. since these patients have hyperphenylalaninemia at birth, it appears that degradation
decreases liver tetrahydrobiopterin to an extent not
sufficient to maintain the necessary rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation. however, most patients
eventually establish normal blood phenylalanine
levels, even though continuing to produce 7-pterins
(17,18). this observation is not unexpected since, for
example, if the liver pool of tetrahydrobiopterin is
decreased during phenylalanine metabolism to 90%
of normal due to lower recycling by the dehydratase,
this would not greatly affect  xxxg1660xxx  activity. conversely, having 10% of the pool as
4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin would result in a
significant increase of 7-biopterin formation. urinary 7-pterin levels, therefore, are a more sensitive
means of detecting dehydratase deficiency than is
the plasma phenylalanine concentration. heterozygotes for dehydratase, which presumably have at
least half of normal activity, excrete normal or only
slightly elevated amounts of 7-pterins (8,28). therefore, in contrast to individuals with 17% of full dehydratase activity, it appears that 50% is adequate
for maintaining tetrahydrobiopterin mostly in the
reduced state.
4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase has
a second function as  xxxg1676xxx , dimerization cofactor of
the transcription factor  xxxg1064xxx ␣ (11,12,29). as a dehydratase, the protein is a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme of four identical subunits of 12,000 da. as
 xxxg1676xxx , two of the 12,000-da subunits combine with
two subunits of  xxxg1064xxx ␣ to form an active transcription complex. a large number of genes are regulated
by  xxxg1064xxx ␣, including  xxxg1660xxx 
(30). other disorders which may be related to deficiency in  xxxg1064xxx ␣ function, such as renal fanconi
syndrome (31), have not been reported for patients
with the e96k or other mutations in this protein.
therefore, either dehydratase catalytic activity is
not required for  xxxg1676xxx  function, or 17% of normal
activity is adequate. also, if there is a conformational change in the protein caused by the mutation,
this has not been observed to have any serious affect
on  xxxg1676xxx  activity.
the variation in dehydratase activity in tissues of
different species (table 5) may be a reflection of the
different diets of each species. since dogs are primarily carnivores, the high activity of dehydratase

observed in the liver would be required to maintain
the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor for phenylalanine
hydroxylase in the metabolism of phenylalanine. on
the other hand, the intestinal dehydratase observed
in this study may play a role in regenerating tetrahydrobiopterin for tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate
limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin.
tryptophan hydroxylase has been localized immunohistochemically in human, rat (32,33), and mouse
(34) intestinal wall and mucosa, although activity is
40-fold lower in mouse intestine than in mouse brain
(35). on the other hand, we have shown that dehydratase activity in rat intestine is similar to that in
rat brain stem (table 1). serotonin is required in the
gi tract for normal digestive function (36). the relatively high dehydratase in human intestine may
explain why patients with as low as 17% of normal
activity do not experience gi dysfunction. since intestinal mucosa is a rapidly regenerating tissue, the
high level of dehydratase, which appears to be in
large excess over that needed to support tryptophan
hydroxylase, could be related to the  xxxg1676xxx  transcriptional function of the protein.
biopsy of intestinal mucosa is a relatively noninvasive procedure. for those enzymes which are not
expressed in a more readily accessible cell type,
analysis of intestinal mucosa samples may provide a
means of assessing the effect of mutations on the
level of activity in vivo.
