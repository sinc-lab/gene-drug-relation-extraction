oxidation by artery wall cells

objective—we have previously reported that products of the lipoxygenase pathway, hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid and
hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, as well as cholesterol linoleate hydroperoxides, collectively termed seeding
molecules, are removed by  xxxg173xxx  ( xxxg1335xxx -i) from the artery wall cells and render low density lipoprotein
(ldl) resistant to oxidation by human artery wall cells. the mechanisms by which oxidized lipids are transported and/or
transferred to lipoproteins and the pathways by which  xxxg1335xxx -i facilitates their removal remain unclear. atp-binding
cassette transporter 1 ( xxxg9xxx ) is known to facilitate the release of cellular phospholipids and cholesterol from the
plasma membrane to  xxxg1335xxx -i and high density lipoprotein. therefore, we evaluated whether  xxxg9xxx  participates in ldl
oxidation.
methods and results—in this report, we show that (1) chemical inhibitors of  xxxg9xxx  function,  xxxd2215xxx  and dids, block
artery wall cell–mediated oxidative modification of ldl, (2) inhibition of  xxxg9xxx  with the use of antisense (but not
sense) oligonucleotides prevents ldl-induced lipid hydroperoxide formation and ldl-induced monocyte chemotactic
activity by the artery wall cells, and (3) oxysterols that induce  xxxg9xxx  expression, such as 22(r)hydroxycholesterol,
enhance cell-mediated ldl oxidation. furthermore, we also show that 22(r)hydroxycholesterol induces the production
of reactive oxygen species in the artery wall cells, which can be removed by incubating the artery wall cells with  xxxg1335xxx -i.
conclusions—our data suggest that  xxxg9xxx  plays an important role in artery wall cell–mediated modification/oxidation
of ldl by modulating the release of reactive oxygen species from artery wall cells that are necessary for ldl oxidation.

ow density lipoprotein is the major source of extracellular cholesterol and phospholipid, and some of these
phospholipids can yield oxidized phospholipids that induce
an inflammatory response.1 an important step in the oxidation of ldl by artery wall cells involves the seeding of ldl
with products of the lipoxygenase pathway: hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (hpode) and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (hpete), as well as cholesterol linoleate
hydroperoxides, collectively termed seeding molecules.1
 xxxg1335xxx -i, a major protein component of hdl particles,2,3 is
known to remove cholesterol and phospholipids from artery
wall cells.4 it is widely accepted that the atheroprotective
actions of  xxxg1335xxx -i or hdl arise from their participation in a
normal physiological process known as reverse cholesterol
transport.5,6 recently, our laboratory has shown that  xxxg1335xxx -i
and an  xxxg1335xxx -i mimetic peptide remove “seeding molecules”
from ldl and render ldl resistant to oxidation by human
artery wall cells.7,8 these findings project a new function for
 xxxg1335xxx -i in removing oxidized lipids from lipoproteins and
cells and further solidify its role as an antiatherogenic
apolipoprotein. however, the mechanisms by which seeding

molecules are transported and/or transferred to lipoproteins
and the pathways by which  xxxg1335xxx -i facilitates the removal of
seeding molecules remain unclear.
 xxxg9xxx  ( xxxg9xxx ) mediates
cholesterol secretion from cells and functions as a ratecontrolling protein in the  xxxg1335xxx -i– dependent active transport
of cholesterol and phospholipids.9,10  xxxg1335xxx -i–mediated lipid
transport requires a functional  xxxg9xxx  protein and specific
binding and/or docking interactions of  xxxg1335xxx -i with the
plasma membrane.11,12 mutations in the  xxxg9xxx  gene result
in the loss of  xxxg1335xxx -i–mediated removal of cellular lipids13,14
and cause tangier disease15–17 and familial hdl deficiency.18,19 disruption of the  xxxg9xxx  gene in mice results in hdl
deficiency and impaired cholesterol and lipid transport,20 –22
and overexpression of  xxxg9xxx  leads to increased cholesterol
and phospholipid efflux to  xxxg1335xxx -i in transgenic mice.23,24
moreover, fibroblasts from patients with  xxxg9xxx  are
defective in transferring phospholipids onto  xxxg1335xxx -i.13 although  xxxg9xxx  was shown to generate a regulated anion flux
when expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes,25 to date,  xxxg9xxx 
has not been implicated in the transport of anionic biomol-

ecules, such as oxidized lipids or reactive oxygen species
(ros). because  xxxg1335xxx -i and  xxxg9xxx  are functionally linked
in cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from cells and because
 xxxg1335xxx -i also facilitates the removal of seeding molecules from
cells,7,8 we hypothesized that  xxxg9xxx  may play a role in
cell-mediated oxidation of ldl by regulating the transfer or
transport of seeding molecules.
in the present study, we investigated whether  xxxg9xxx 
participates in the oxidative modification of ldl by human
artery wall cells. we have used chemical inhibitors of
 xxxg9xxx  function, inducers of  xxxg9xxx  expression (oxysterols), and specific inhibition of  xxxg9xxx  protein expression
(antisense oligonucleotides), and we have shown that  xxxg9xxx 
plays a key role in cell-mediated oxidative modification of
ldl by human artery wall cells.

methods
materials
all cell culture media and reagents were supplied by gibco-brl.
human  xxxg1335xxx -i,  xxxd2215xxx , dids, and 22(r)-hydroxycholesterol
(22-r-ohc) were obtained from sigma chemical co. oligonucleotides were purchased from operon technologies. ldl (density
1.019 to 1.063 g/ml) and hdl (density 1.063 to 1.21 g/ml) were
isolated on the basis of the protocol described by havel et al.26

cell cultures
human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) and human aortic smooth
muscle cells (hasmcs) were isolated and cultured as described
previously.7,8 monocytes were prepared by a modification of the
method reported by colotta et al27 from the blood of normal
volunteers after obtaining written consent under a protocol approved
by the human research subject protection committee of the
university of california, los angeles. cocultures were set up in
6-well culture dishes treated with 0.1% gelatin at 37°c overnight.
hasmcs were added at a density of 1⫻105 cells/cm2. cells were
cultured for 2 days, and haecs were subsequently added at 2⫻105
cells/cm2 and were allowed to grow, forming a complete monolayer
of confluent haecs in 2 days. in all experiments, haecs and
autologous hasmcs (from the same donor) were used at passages
4 to 6.

figure 1.  xxxd2215xxx  and dids, inhibitors of  xxxg9xxx  function,
impair cell-mediated modification of ldl in human artery wall
cocultures. artery wall cocultures were treated overnight with
either  xxxd2215xxx  (100 ␮mol/l) or dids (100 ␮mol/l) in medium
199 containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum (lpds). ldl
(250 ␮g/ml) was added to the cocultures, and 18 hours later,
the supernatants were removed and assayed for auerbach lipid
hydroperoxide equivalents30 (left) and monocyte chemotactic
activity (right). similar results were obtained in 3 independent
experiments. *p⬍0.05.

transfection complexes were added to the wells and incubated for 2
hours. the cultures were washed in pbs and supplemented with
complete medium 199. eighteen hours later, the transfection protocol
was repeated, and cultures received 250 ␮g/ml of ldl. six hours
later, supernatants were collected and tested for monocyte adhesion
activity and monocyte chemotactic activity. additionally, total cellular protein was isolated from each experimental condition and
analyzed for  xxxg9xxx  by western analysis, as described above. the
oligonucleotides used were antisense (5⬘ catgttgttcatagggtgggtagctc 3⬘) and sense (5⬘ gagctacccaccctatgaacaacatg 3⬘).

other methods
monocyte chemotactic activity assays were performed as described
previously.7,8 protein concentrations were determined by using the
bradford reagent (bio-rad). lipid hydroperoxides were determined
by the method reported by auerbach et al.30 statistical significance
was determined by anova. the analyses were first carried out with
the excel application program (microsoft), followed by a paired
student t test to identify significantly different means. significance is
defined as p⬍0.05.

northern and western analyses
northern analyses were performed as described previously.28 human
 xxxg9xxx  cdna was provided by dr peter edwards (university of
california, los angeles). western analyses were performed as
described previously.8 briefly, protein extracts from human artery
wall cocultures (60 ␮g) were subjected to sds-page on 5%
tris-hcl gels. proteins were electroblotted onto hybond ecl
nitrocellulose membranes (amersham) and incubated for 3 hours
with rabbit anti-human  xxxg9xxx  antiserum (novus biologicals) at
1:100 dilution. proteins were detected by using an ecl western
blotting kit (amersham) according to the manufacturer’s suggested
protocol.

antisense oligonucleotide experiments
antisense oligonucleotide experiments were performed as described
previously.29 briefly, haec/hasmc cocultures were set up in
6-well plates. phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (operon technologies) were used at a final concentration of 100 nmol/l for all
antisense transfection experiments. appropriate amounts of the
oligonucleotides were diluted in 200 ␮l serum-free medium 199 in
0.5-ml eppendorf tubes. three microliters of superfect reagent
(qiagen, inc) was added to each tube and incubated at room
temperature for 15 minutes to allow superfect reagent–dna complex formation. during the incubation, the haecs were washed with
pbs and supplemented with 0.8 ml complete medium 199. the

results
inhibitors of  xxxg9xxx  function impair artery wall
coculture–mediated modification of ldl
to determine whether  xxxg9xxx  plays a role in cell-mediated
oxidation of ldl, we first examined the effect of inhibitors
of  xxxg9xxx  function,  xxxd2215xxx  and dids, on artery wall
coculture–mediated oxidation of ldl. as expected, on the
basis of our previous studies,7,8 when cocultures were incubated with ldl (250 ␮g/ml, 18 hours), ldl-induced lipid
hydroperoxides and ldl-induced monocyte chemotactic activity were elevated in the coculture supernatants (figure 1).
however, pretreatment of the cocultures with either  xxxd2215xxx 
(100 ␮mol/l) or dids (100 ␮mol/l) significantly impaired
cell-mediated oxidative modification of ldl, as indicated by
the decrease in ldl-induced lipid hydroperoxides (figure 1,
left), and decreased ldl-induced monocyte chemotactic
activity (figure 1, right) in the coculture supernatants. furthermore, the results were dose dependent in experiments in
which  xxxd2215xxx  and dids were both tested at different
concentrations between 10 and 200 ␮mol/l.  xxxd2215xxx  and

figure 3. antisense oligonucleotides to  xxxg9xxx  inhibit artery

were transfected with antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (100 nmol/l) to human  xxxg9xxx . after transfections, control
and transfected cells were either left untreated or were treated
with ldl (250 ␮g/ml) for an additional 6 hours. after the treatments, cell supernatants were collected and analyzed for auerbach lipid hydroperoxide equivalents30 (left) and monocyte chemotactic activity (right). the results were similar in 3
independent experiments. *p⬍0.05.
figure 2. 22-r-ohc induces  xxxg9xxx  expression and enhances
cell-mediated modification of ldl in human artery wall cocultures. a and b, confluent cocultures (hasmcs and haecs)
were either untreated (⫺) or treated (⫹) with 22-r-ohc (25
␮mol/l). eighteen hours later, the cells were lysed, and 10 ␮g
total rna (a) and 60 ␮g total protein (b) from each condition
were subjected to northern and western analyses for  xxxg9xxx ,
respectively. c, artery wall cocultures were either left untreated
or were treated with 22-r-ohc (25 ␮mol/l) for 18 hours.
freshly isolated ldl (250 ␮g/ml) was added to cells, and 6
hours later, supernatants were removed and assayed for auerbach lipid hydroperoxide equivalents30 (left) and monocyte chemotactic activity (right) as described in methods. each experimental condition was performed in triplicate wells, and data are
expressed as mean⫾sd. the results were similar in 3 separate
experiments. *p⬍0.05.

dids at the concentrations used in coculture experiments
showed no cytotoxicity and completely blocked hdlmediated cholesterol efflux (data not shown) in human
monocyte macrophages. these results suggest that cellmediated ldl oxidation and cholesterol efflux share a
common mechanism(s).

antisense oligonucleotides to  xxxg9xxx  disrupt
coculture-mediated oxidation of ldl
we next examined the effect of selective inhibition of
 xxxg9xxx  on coculture-mediated oxidation of ldl. antisense
oligonucleotides targeted to human  xxxg9xxx  mrna have
been previously used to successfully block the expression of
 xxxg9xxx  protein and  xxxg9xxx  function in macrophages.9,32
transfection with oligonucleotides alone, either sense or
antisense, did not affect the accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides or monocyte chemotactic activity in untreated artery
wall coculture supernatants (figure 3). pretreatment of cocultures with antisense oligonucleotides significantly impaired
cell-mediated oxidative modification of ldl, as was evident
from the decrease in ldl-induced lipid hydroperoxides
(figure 3, left) and ldl-induced monocyte chemotactic
activity (figure 3, right) in the coculture supernatants.
these data suggest that  xxxg9xxx  modulates the cell-

inducers of  xxxg9xxx  expression enhance
coculture-mediated modification of ldl
because inhibitors of  xxxg9xxx  function impaired the ability of
artery wall cells to modify/oxidize ldl, we next examined
the effect of inducers of  xxxg9xxx  expression on coculturemediated modification of ldl. 22-r-ohc is a potent inducer
of  xxxg9xxx  transcription in macrophages.31  xxxg9xxx  mrna
(figure 2a) and protein (figure 2b) were induced after
22-r-ohc treatment in artery wall cocultures. 22-r-ohc
that was incubated directly with ldl did not affect either the
lipid hydroperoxide content of ldl or ldl-induced monocyte chemotactic activity. however, cocultures pretreated
with 22-r-ohc oxidized ldl significantly more than did
the untreated cocultures (figure 2c, left), and cocultures
pretreated with 22-r-ohc (25 ␮mol/l) had significantly
higher monocyte chemotactic activity (figure 2c, right). the
results were significant and consistent in dose-response experiments in which 22-r-ohc concentrations between 5 and
50 ␮mol/l were tested.

figure 4. antisense oligonucleotides to  xxxg9xxx  inhibit cellmediated modification of ldl in22-r-ohc–treated human artery
wall cocultures. artery wall cocultures were transfected with
either antisense or sense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides
(100 nmol/l) to human  xxxg9xxx , as described in methods. the
cells were further treated with 22-r-ohc (25 ␮mol/l) in the
presence or absence of ldl (250 ␮g/ml). after the treatments,
cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by western blotting for
 xxxg9xxx  protein expression (a), and cell culture supernatants
were analyzed for monocyte chemotactic activity (b). *p⬍0.05.

mediated oxidative modification of ldl by artery wall
cells. furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides to  xxxg9xxx 
inhibited the accumulation of  xxxg9xxx  protein in artery
wall cocultures pretreated with 22-r-ohc (figure 4a),
and they also prevented ldl-induced monocyte chemotactic activity in the supernatants of cocultures that had
been pretreated with 22-r-ohc (figure 4b).

22-r-ohc induces the accumulation of
intracellular ros
incubating cocultures with 22-r-ohc not only induced
 xxxg9xxx  expression (figure 2a) but also enhanced coculturemediated modification of ldl (figure 2b). moreover, antisense oligonucleotides to  xxxg9xxx  attenuated 22-r-ohc–
mediated ldl oxidation (figure 4b). the increase in ldl
oxidation, after exposure to 22-r-ohc, could be due to either
an increase in the transport of ros alone (via increases in
 xxxg9xxx  expression) or an increase in the synthesis of ros.
to test the later possibility, we examined the accumulation of
intracellular ros in 22-r-ohc–treated cocultures. we have
recently reported the use of 2⬘,7⬘-dichlorofluorescin diacetate
(dcfh-da) to measure intracellular oxidative stress.33 this
assay quantifies the fluorescence emitted when the nonfluorescent dcfh-da is oxidized to the highly fluorescent
dichlorofluorescein (dcf) by intracellular ros. artery wall
cocultures were incubated with 100 ␮mol/l dcfh-da for 1
hour and subsequently treated with varying concentrations (0
to 50 ␮mol/l) of 22-r-ohc. no significant difference in
emitted fluorescence was observed between cells treated with
vehicle alone or untreated cells (data not shown). emitted
fluorescence was significantly higher (at all time points
tested) in cocultures treated with 22-r-ohc (50 ␮mol/l)
than in control cells (figure 5a). 22-r-ohc incubated alone
(in the absence of cells) with dcfh-da did not cause any
changes in emitted fluorescence (data not shown), suggesting
that 22-r-ohc, by itself, does not oxidize dcfh-da to the
fluorescent dcf. these experiments demonstrate that oxysterols, such as 22-r-ohc, induce the synthesis and/or
accumulation of ros in artery wall cocultures.

 xxxg1335xxx -i renders 22-r-ohc–incubated cocultures
unable to oxidize ldl
 xxxg1335xxx -i removes ros, including hpete and hpode, and
renders artery wall cells unable to oxidize ldl.7,8 we next
examined whether  xxxg1335xxx -i is able to remove 22-r-ohc–
induced ros from the artery wall cocultures and thus prevent
22-r-ohc–induced ldl oxidation by cocultures. cocultures
pretreated with 22-r-ohc oxidized ldl significantly more
than did untreated cocultures (figure 5b, left), and cocultures
pretreated with 22-r-ohc (25 ␮mol/l) had significantly
higher monocyte chemotactic activity (figure 5b, right).
however,  xxxg1335xxx -i (100 ␮g/ml) added to the cells for 6 hours
after 22-r-ohc treatment and removal before the addition of
ldl significantly inhibited the ability of cocultures to modify ldl (figure 5b).

discussion
in presenting possible explanations for the decrease in
atherosclerosis in 12/15-lipoxygenase– knockout mice,

figure 5. a, 22-r-ohc induces the accumulation of intracellular
ros. artery wall cocultures were incubated with dcfh-da for 1
hour, washed, and treated with either 25 or 50 ␮mol/l 22-rohc. intracellular oxidative stress was measured by quantifying
the fluorescence emitted when the nonfluorescent dcfh-da
was oxidized by ros to the highly fluorescent dcf. b,  xxxg1335xxx -i
renders 22-r-ohc–incubated cocultures unable to oxidize ldl.
cocultures were treated with 22-r-ohc (25 ␮mol/l) or were
sham-treated for 2 hours. the cells were washed and given
fresh medium, and some of the cultures were treated with
 xxxg1335xxx -i (100 ␮g/ml) for an additional 6 hours. at the end of the
incubation, all cultures were washed and incubated overnight
with or without ldl (250 ␮g/ml) as indicated. the supernatants
were removed and assayed for auerbach lipid hydroperoxide
equivalents (left panel) and monocyte chemotactic activity (right
panel). the data are expressed as mean⫾sd.

cyrus et al34 concluded that several mechanisms could
explain their findings, but they favored one in which
“. . .lipoxygenase-derived hydroperoxides or secondary reactive lipid species may be transferred across the cell
membrane to ‘seed’ the extracellular ldl, which would
then be more susceptible to a variety of mechanisms that
could promote lipid peroxidation.” because abca-1 mediates the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids from
cells by  xxxg1335xxx -i,35 we hypothesized that  xxxg9xxx  might also
participate in the transfer of the seeding molecules from
artery wall cells to ldl. in the present study, we demonstrated that  xxxg9xxx  modulates artery wall cell–mediated
oxidation of ldl. recent evidence suggests that  xxxg9xxx 
may have a more indirect role in cholesterol transport and
thus functions as a  xxxg9xxx .36,37 several reports also indicate that  xxxg9xxx  is not
confined to regulating the transport of cholesterol and

reddy et al
phospholipids alone.  xxxg9xxx  modulates the secretion of
apoe from human monocyte– derived macrophages, 32
interluekin-1␤ secretion,38 and ␣-tocopherol.39 our data
suggest that  xxxg9xxx  may also modulate the secretion of
ros from artery wall cells that are necessary for ldl
oxidation.
we found that 22-r-ohc not only induced accumulation
of intracellular ros (figure 5) in artery wall cocultures but
also significantly increased artery wall cell–mediated ldl
oxidation (figure 2). we previously demonstrated that human
artery wall cells contain 12-lipoxygenase protein and mrna
and that chemical inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides of
12-lipoxygenase inhibited the ability of the cells to oxidize
ldl.8 on the basis of our previous results,8 we hypothesized
that oxysterols may activate 12-lipoxygenase, resulting in
increased synthesis of hpete and hpode and thus causing
an increase in ldl oxidation. however, inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase did not affect the 22-r-ohc–mediated increase in
ldl-induced monocyte chemotactic activity (data not
shown). furthermore, we did not find any changes in 15-lipoxygenase and  xxxg147xxx  (message or protein) after
treatment of the artery wall cocultures with 22-r-ohc (data
not shown). it is possible that oxygenated sterols may
regulate ldl oxidation by artery wall cells either via posttranslational modifications of lipoxygenases or via a novel
previously unidentified pathway(s), such as increasing phospholipase activity in the artery wall cells, resulting in increased synthesis of  xxxd208xxx  and linoleic acid, the
substrates for lipoxygenases. we are currently evaluating
these possibilities.
interestingly, liao et al40 recently reported that native ldl
induces  xxxg9xxx  mrna and protein in vascular endothelial
cells.  xxxg9xxx  protein induction by native ldl at 24 hours
was significant, but it was only moderate in haecs compared with huvecs, which were the predominant cells used
in their studies.40 in our experiments, ldl alone did not
significantly induce  xxxg9xxx  message or protein in haecs or
cocultures after 6 hours of ldl treatment (data not shown).
liao et al also suggest that overexpression of  xxxg9xxx  by
ldl prevents overloading of cholesterol by increasing the
efflux of cholesterol. the data and conclusions from their
studies are consistent with our hypotheses that reverse cholesterol transport and ldl oxidation/metabolism may be
linked in the artery wall.
in light of our findings, one might expect that the
balance between the transport out of the cell of the seeding
molecules by  xxxg9xxx  to extracellular ldl (favoring ldl
oxidation) and the generation of higher levels of hdl
(which could prevent ldl oxidation) might be a complex
process, and it might be difficult to predict whether
 xxxg9xxx  would promote or retard atherogenesis. in fact,
some of the unexpected results from studies on  xxxg9xxx 
transgenic and knockout mice20 –24,41– 45 do not support a
simple reverse cholesterol transport model.46 joyce et al42
recently reported that transgenic expression of  xxxg9xxx 
reduced atherosclerosis in c57bl/6j mice fed an atherogenic diet containing  xxxd1685xxx  but actually increased
atherosclerosis in apoe-null mice that were also transgenic
for human  xxxg9xxx . in contrast, singaraja et al44 reported

 xxxg9xxx  and ldl oxidation by artery wall cells

figure 6.  xxxg9xxx  and  xxxg1335xxx -i are components of the mechanism
that links reverse cholesterol transport and ldl oxidation. in the
artery wall cells (haecs and hasmcs),  xxxg9xxx  is (either directly
or indirectly) required for the transport of cholesterol, phospholipids, and oxidized lipids.  xxxg1335xxx -i acquires cholesterol and
phospholipids in an  xxxg9xxx -dependent mechanism and participates in hdl synthesis.11 lipoxygenase-derived hydroperoxides
or other ros are transferred across the cell membrane via an
 xxxg9xxx -dependent mechanism to seed the extracellular ldl.
 xxxg1335xxx -i removes oxidized lipids and ros and renders artery wall
cells unable to modify ldl.7,8 the diagram also assumes that
the cholesterol content of the cells determines the cellular content of oxygenated sterols, such as 22-r-ohc. 22-r-ohc
increases cellular ros in the presence of ldl by an as-yetunidentified pathway and increases ldl oxidation. thus, the
reverse cholesterol transport pathway may be linked to ldl oxidation in at least 2 ways: (1)  xxxg9xxx  is required for reverse cholesterol transport and ldl oxidation. (2) cellular cholesterol levels may determine the cellular levels of 22-r-ohc, which, in
part, regulates cell-mediated ldl oxidation by an as-yetunidentified pathway.

that human  xxxg9xxx – overexpressing transgenic mice had
reduced atherosclerosis. aiello et al41 reported that the
complete absence of  xxxg9xxx  did not affect the development, progression, or composition of atherosclerotic lesions in either  xxxg1318xxx –null or apoe-null mice fed
either a chow or atherogenic diet. however, aiello et al41
and van eck et al,45 using bone marrow transplantation,
found that the absence of  xxxg9xxx  from macrophages
resulted in increased atherosclerosis in apoe-null41 and
 xxxg1318xxx –null45 mice. thus, the role of  xxxg9xxx  in
atherosclerosis is clearly complex.
our data suggest that reverse cholesterol transport and
ldl oxidation may share common mechanisms (figure 6) in
at least 2 ways: (1)  xxxg9xxx  participates in reverse cholesterol
transport and ldl oxidation. (2) cellular cholesterol levels
may determine the cellular levels of 22-r-ohc, which, in
part, regulates cell-mediated ldl oxidation. the diagram in
figure 6 also implies that the relative balance between ldl
concentrations and hdl formation will determine intracellular cholesterol levels and the extracellular pathway for oxidized lipids and/or ros. this scheme would predict that at
high levels of ldl relative to hdl formation, ldl oxidation

would be favored, whereas at low levels of ldl relative to
hdl formation, ldl oxidation would not be favored. thus,
the rate of formation and clearance of mature hdl relative to
ldl levels would determine in part the rate of ldl oxidation
and atherogenesis.
