 xxxd2904xxx , an h,-receptor antagonist that was developed ulmost 50 years ago, has been
associated with both drowsiness and insomnia. since its central nervous system profile has not
been well characterized, we used a series of psychomotor tests to conduct two studies. in the
,first, 12 subjects received single oral doses of  xxxd2904xxx  (25 mg), diphenhydramine
(50 mg),
terfenadine (60 mg), or placebo in a four-way crossover study. psychomotor tests included
choice reaction time (crt), tracking, and hand steadiness (hs). in the second trial, 1.5 .sut@ts
received single oral doses of  xxxd2904xxx  (2.5 mg), pseudoephedrine (60 mg),  xxxd2904xxx 
und pseudoephedrine,
diphenhydramine
(50 mg), or placebo in ahve-way crossover study.
psychomotor tests included crt, hs, and a task that divided attention between tracking and
reaction time. introspective drowsiness was measured in both trials with use of a visual anabg
scale (vas) and the stanford sleepiness scale (sss). all assessments were made before and i (
3, and 5 hours after drug administration.
in the jirst trial, diphenhydramine produced
.significant impairment relative to placebo (p < 0.05) in crt- tracking, and hs tasks and higher
sss and va/asscores, with peak effect noted at 3 hours.  xxxd2904xxx  did not significantlv differ
from placebo or terfenadine. in the second trial, diphenhydramine
produced signi$cant
impairment relative to placebo (p < 0.05) in crt, divided attention, hs, and vas, and sss.
ulso peaking at 3 hours. stanford sleepiness scale scores after  xxxd2904xxx  were greater than
placebo at 3 hours (p < 0.05) but significantly less than diphenhydramine
(p < 0.05).
psychomotor test scores after  xxxd2904xxx  and pseudoephedrine,
either alone or in
combination. were consistently and most often significantly better than diphenhydramine
and not
significantly different from placebo. taken together, these data indicate that sleepiness after u
single dose of  xxxd2904xxx  is rank ordered between placebo and diphenhydramine.
we
speculate that the relative lack of impairment reflected by the psychomotor tests .from
 xxxd2904xxx  may be related to its paradoxic sedative and stimulaton~ yflecrs. (j ai.i.erw c‘ijp:

the soporific profile of many of the first generation
h,-receptor antagonists has not been well characterized. pheninclamine tartrate is an hi-receptor antagonist currently available by prescription (nolabist) and
approved for over-the-counter sale in the otc tentative final monograph. i2 it has been associated with
both drowsiness and insomnia in older reports. 13-‘*in
an attempt to better characterize this drug’s soporific
profile, we conducted two studies of daytime sleepiness and psychomotor performance. our observations
form the basis of this report.
methods
design
both studies were conducted in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, crossover format. at least 72
hours were required between each leg of each study. both
studies were granted institutional review board approval,
and all subjectsgave informed written consent.

procedure
volunteers were recruited if they were between the ages
of 18 and 45 years, in good health, and motivated to participate in the study. subjects were disqualified from participation if they had a history, symptoms, or physical signs
of asthma, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, glaucoma, prostatic disease, ulcer, or bladder dysfunction.
within 30 days of starting the study, subjects were not
allowed to be exposed to an investigational drug,  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  (mao) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants,
phenothiazines, sedatives,or steroids. those with a history
of chronic antihistamine use, alcohol or drug abuse, abnormal sleep habits, and allergy or sensitivity to antihistamines or sympathomimetic decongestants were excluded.
also, those working evening or night shifts or excessive
usersof caffeine were excluded.
good health was documented by a medical history and
physical examination. at the time of entry screening, subjects received instructions on the psychomotor performance
testing; 2 to 4 hours of intermittent practice in performing
the psychomotor tests followed.
each time subjectsreported for treatment and testing they
were qualified to participate on the basisof continued good

no use of medication during the preceding 72 hours, no
consumption of alcohol within 24 hours, no caffeine consumption within 8 hours, and at least 7 hours of sleep the
preceding night. an abbreviated version (approximately 10
minutes) of the performance
battery was performed
each morning for refamiliarization
with the tests and
environment.
in both studies a complete assessment of subjective sleepiness and psychomotor performance was carried out before
administration of drug and at 1, 3, and 5 hours after administration of drug.
in the first crossover trial, subjects received single doses
of  xxxd2904xxx  tartrate (25 mg), diphenhydramine
hcl
(50 mg), terfenadine (60 mg), or placebo. all drugs were
supplied in capsules with the exception of terfenadine (seldane tablets). blinding was achieved by a double-dummy
technique, with each subject receiving one capsule and one
tablet at each dosing. in the second crossover study, subjects
received a single capsule dose of  xxxd2904xxx  tartrate (25
mg), pseudoephedrine hcl(60 mg),  xxxd2904xxx  (25 mg)
in combination with pseudoephedrine hcl (60 mg),  xxxd1906xxx  (50 mg), or placebo.

subjective ussessments and psychomotor tests. subjective assessments focused on introspective sleepiness raings on the stanford sleepiness scalei” and a computerized
visual analog scale in which the subjects marked the scale
on the screen using the space bar and enter key of the
computer. alertness, jitteriness, and mouth dryness were
also assessed with use of a visual analog scale. al1 scales
were anchored by the words “not at all“ to “extremely.”
subjective ratings always preceded the performance tasks.
psychomotor performance was evaluated with use of
modified computerized tests taken from a vigilance test battery described by rosa et al.‘” (table i). since the tirithmetic
and grammatical tasks were not found to be sensitive to
diphenhydramine
(i.e., no significant impairment). they
were not included in the second study. divided attention
and digit symbol substitution tasks were added to the second
study. only choice reaction time and hand steadiness were
common to both trials. test batteries in both studies required
approximately 30 minutes to complete.
statistical design und analysis. both studies were
designed with use of a complete latin square design assuring
that every treatment followed every other treatment equally
often. data were analyzed by an anatysis of variance

with terfenadine had significantly less hand steadiness
relative to placebo; however, the magnitude was
small. neither the grammatical reasoning nor the

to placebo.

the reaction time after diphenhydramine was significantly slower than  xxxd2904xxx  and pseudoephedrine, either alone or in combination. in addition, the

dramine was also significantly different from  xxxd2904xxx  at 3 hours after dosing and different from
phenindaminelpseudoephedrine
1 and 3 hours after
drug. the improvements in tracking ability after pseudoephedrine alone were significantly different from
the scores after diphenhydramine at all three time
points.
diphenhydramine did not significantly impair perimeter response time. at 5 hours after drug, however,
the slight impairment after  xxxd2904xxx , either alone
or in combination with pseudoephedrine, was significantly less than the impairment after placebo. by
contrast, diphenhydramine caused significant increase
in central response time (i.e., slower response) when
compared with placebo and all other treatments at both
1 and 3 hours after drug (table iv).
the percent of contact of a handheld probe with
the sides of a small jack did not differ significantly
among treatment groups, with the exception of the
greater percent contact after diphenhydramine relative
to the  xxxd2904xxx  / pseudoephedrine combination.
a significant difference was also noted in the change
from baseline in number of touches (12.7 vs 55.6).
the increase in the number of touches 1 hour after
diphenhydramine was significantly different from that
observed after placebo. at 5 hours after pseudoephedtine, there were approximately 20 fewer touches than
the predrug observation, which was significantly different from the increased number of touches (26.5)
after placebo.
no differences occurred among treatments in the
digit symbol substitution test.
discussion
hi-receptor antagonists have been available for approximately 50 years. until the relatively recent introduction of a second generation of “nonsedating”
compounds, the clinical use of these widely used drugs
was hampered by their propensity to cause drowsiness. the degree of drowsiness among these original
compounds, however, has not been extensively
studied.
in the trials reported here we studied the effects of
 xxxd2904xxx  tartrate on psychomotor performance
in healthy subjects.  xxxd2904xxx , which was introduced in the late 1940s was chosen because previous
reports indicated that its psychopharmacologic properties may differ from other first generation compounds. 13-18diphenhydramine, one of the most sedating antihistamines, was chosen at 50 mg as a positive control, and terfenadine (60 mg), the first
nonsedating drug introduced, was chosen as a negative
control. the introspective drowsiness reported after
 xxxd2904xxx  was generally ranked between placebo

and diphenhydramine. although not significantly different from placebo or terfenadine in the first trial,
 xxxd2904xxx  was significantly different from placebo
in the second trial, possibly because of the larger
sample size. in both trials, diphenhydramine-sensitive
psychomotor performance tests were not altered by
 xxxd2904xxx . in addition, terfenadine and pseudoephedrine did not significantly alter performance tests.
the impairment after diphenhydramine was similar
to other trials of psychomotor performance,21 with
peak effects observed 2 to 3 hours after dosing. the
lack of impairment after terfenadine in our study was
also consistent with previous reports of this agent.5
finally, the lack of significant alteration in daytime
performance after pseudoephedrine corroborates previous observations,** including the trend for slight
improvement in daytime performance scores.
 xxxd2904xxx , which was clearly less sedating than
diphenhydramine, may be considered a mildly sedating compound. as a pyridindine,  xxxd2904xxx  is
structurally unique among the first generation compounds, most of which fit into the ethanolamine (e.g.,
diphenhydramine),
alkylamine (e.g., chlorpheniramine), or ethylenediamine (e.g.,  xxxd3050xxx ) structural classes. its uniqueness is supported by recent
observations that latency to daytime sleep, as measured by the multiple sleep latency test (mslt),
was not different between terfenadine or placebo.23 in
a recent trial of  xxxd2904xxx  in patients with seasonal
allergic rhinitis, however, the reported incidence of
sedation after  xxxd2904xxx  (17%) was significantly
greater than after placebo (3%).24 nervousness and
insomnia were also reported significantly more frequently in subjects treated with  xxxd2904xxx .24 in
addition, central nervous system stimulation has also
been reported to be more frequent than after terfenadine or placebo during 1 week of use in a group of
healthy volunteers. 25 it may be that the relative lack
of impairment observed in our trial is related to its
stimulating effects. although  xxxd2904xxx  has been
shown to increase the duration of the pressor response
to 1-norepinephrine ,26the mechanism of its stimulatory
properties remains unknown.
in conclusion,  xxxd2904xxx  tarn-ate appears to be
a unique first generation h,-receptor antagonist. it is
clearly less sedating than diphenhydramine, does not
shorten latency to daytime sleep,” and under the conditions of our study did not significantly alter performance on psychomotor performance tests. however,
in actual use,  xxxd2904xxx  has recently been shown
to cause sedation as well as nervousness and insomnia
with extended dosing in patients with allergic rhinitis.24 a high incidence (51%) of insomnia has also
been reported during 1 week of therapy in a group of

healthy volunteers. 25 therefore  xxxd2904xxx  does
not exhibit a nonsedating profile and may have paradoxic stimulatory and sedative properties.
