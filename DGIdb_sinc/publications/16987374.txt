we report two clinical cases of cardiac arrest, the former due to
an adverse effect of intravenous (i.v.) propranolol in a patient
with systemic sclerosis, the latter from a propranolol suicidal
overdose. in both cases, conventional advanced life support
(als) was ineffective but both patients eventually responded
to the administration of  xxxd1998xxx , a  xxxg1695xxx 
(pde iii) inhibitor. after the arrest, both patients regained
consciousness and were discharged home. the chronotropic
and inotropic effects of pde iii inhibitors are due to inhibition
of intracellular pdeiii and are therefore unaffected by betablockers. these cases suggest that pdeiii inhibitors may be

useful in restoring spontaneous circulation in cardiac arrest
associated with beta-blocker administration when standard
als is ineffective.

absent. the amiodarone infusion was stopped and
cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started.
blood gas analysis ruled out any immediately
treatable causes, such as hypoxia, acidosis or electrolyte disturbances. after 15 min of advanced life
support (als) and 6 mg of epinephrine, the patient
was still in cardiac arrest. the ecg continued to
show sinus bradycardia. a 100-mg i.v. bolus of
 xxxd1998xxx  was administered and 3 min later recovery of spontaneous circulation occurred. bp was 150/
110 mmhg and pulse oxymetry was 99% on 100%
oxygen. the ecg showed a normal sinus rhythm at
130/min. still unconscious, the patient was transferred into the intensive care unit (icu) and mechanically ventilated.
during the following hour, haemodynamic parameters stabilized within normal limits and no further
treatment was required. the patient regained consciousness and was subsequently discharged home
with no neurological sequelae.

e report two cases of prolonged cardiac arrest
caused by beta-blockers, unresponsive to standard therapy, in which the administration of the
phosphodiestherase iii (pdeiii) inhibitor  xxxd1998xxx 
was followed by a rapid restoration of spontaneous
circulation.

case report 1
a 38-year-old woman (168 cm height, 72 kg weight)
was admitted into our emergency room because of
sudden onset of palpitations, shortness of breath and
dizziness. she had a history of severe systemic
sclerosis complicated with pulmonary fibrosis and
heart failure.
on admission, her ecg showed supraventricular
tachycardia at a rate of 170 bpm. her blood pressure
(bp) was 100/60 mmhg. initial treatment with
intravenous (i.v.) adenosine was unsuccessful, so
 xxxd3426xxx -mg i.v. bolus of amiodarone was given, followed by an i.v. infusion at a rate of 38 mg/h.
fifteen minutes later, because there had been no
improvement, a 1.5-mg i.v. bolus of propranolol was
administered. immediately after, the rhythm
changed from supraventricular tachycardia into
sinus bradycardia 35 bpm and the patient became
unresponsive and apnoeic. a carotid pulse was

case report 2
a 50-year-old man (height 170 cm, weight 85 kg) was
brought by his relatives to a local emergency medical
facility 40 min after a suicidal ingestion of 150 ml of
hydrochloric acid, 1600 mg of propranolol, and an

unknown dose of oxazepam. on admission he was
alert but hypotensive (bp 90/60 mmhg). his pulse
rate was 45 bpm. pulse oxymetry was 97% in room
air. oxygen via a face mask, fluids and flumazenil 0.4
mg were given, a dopamine infusion at 6 mg/kg/min
was started and the patient was transferred to our
hospital.
during transport, the patient’s condition deteriorated and immediately after his arrival at our emergency room, he had a cardiac arrest. an ecg showed
bradycardia at 40 bpm, with no carotid pulse. the
patient was intubated, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started. epinephrine 1 mg i.v. was
administered, followed by atropine 3 mg. subsequent doses of 1 mg of epinephrine were given every
3 min. blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis
(ph ¼ 6.91), which was corrected with a total of
140 meq of sodium bicarbonate.
to correct possible hypovolemia, 500 ml of fluids
was given. there was no hypoxia and electrolyte
concentrations were within normal limits.
after 30 min of als the patient was still in cardiac
arrest and an ecg showed asystole. a 100-mg bolus
of  xxxd1998xxx  was given intravenously, followed by
an infusion at a rate of 5 mg/kg/min. after a further
5 min of als, some narrow qrs complexes appeared
on the monitor and a carotid pulse became palpable.
immediately after, a normal sinus rhythm at 80 bpm
was established. bp was 80/60 mmhg.
the patient was transferred into the icu in a state
of shock (bp 80/40 mmhg, cardiac index 2.3 l/min/
m2) and required prolonged infusions of dopamine,
norepinephrine and  xxxd1998xxx . for the following
96 h,  xxxd1998xxx  was continued as an infusion at a
5 mg/kg/min rate. dopamine and norepinephrine
were stopped on day six. the cardiac situation was
thereafter stable and the patient was eventually discharged with no neurological impairment.

discussion
beta-blockers act as competitive inhibitors of epinephrine and norepinephrine binding to betaadrenergic receptors. their action is mediated by
a reduction of the  xxxd1773xxx  (camp) in the target
cells (1). beta-blockers reduce both heart rate and
cardiac output and may cause cardiac arrest when
given at high doses (2–5).
propranolol is the beta-blocker most commonly
implicated in fatal cases. in a review of 52,156
exposures reported by the american association of
poison control centers toxic exposure surveillance
system (2), propranolol exposure accounted for 71%

760

of the total deaths. in a series of 58 self-poisonings
with beta-blockers reported by reith et al. (6), propranolol was the only beta-blocker associated with
death.
in case 1, cardiac arrest was probably due to an
exaggerated haemodynamic response to intravenous
propranolol in a patient with pre-existing heart
failure secondary to scleroderma. a synergistic negative inotropic effect of the previously administered
amiodarone could have facilitated the cardiac arrest
in this case, although a relevant negative interaction
of amiodarone with beta-blockers has not been
demonstrated (7).
in case 2, the ingested dose of propranolol was five
times the maximum recommended daily dose. the
profound circulatory depression caused by the propranolol overdose has probably been increased by
the metabolic acidosis as a result of hydrochloric acid
coingestion.
we recently reported a case of cathecolamineresistant shock due to combined beta-blockers and
calcium channel blockers overdose successfully
treated with  xxxd1998xxx  (8). like cathecolamines,
 xxxd1998xxx  has inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic effects due to an increase of the intracellular
 xxxd1773xxx  (camp). however, differently from cathecolamines, these effects are not mediated by the beta
receptors on the cell membrane, but are due to
inhibition of the intracellular phosphodiesterase isoenzyme iii (pde iii) (9). the effect of  xxxd1998xxx  is
therefore unaffected by beta-blockers.
in experimental models of cardiac arrest, pdeiii
inhibitors reduce post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction (10), but their clinical use for the treatment
of cardiac arrest in humans had never been reported
before. we think that the beta receptor-independent
chronotropic and inotropic effect of  xxxd1998xxx  has
been the most likely cause of recovery of spontaneous circulation in these two cases. the desired effect
of vasopressors used for the treatment of cardiac
arrest, such as epinephrine or vasopressin, consists of
an increase in peripheral resistance (11), which improves blood flow to vital organs, especially the
heart. however, this effect is absent with  xxxd1998xxx ,
which acts instead as a vasodilator. in these two
cases, the undesired vasodilating effect of  xxxd1998xxx 
has been probably counterbalanced by the vasoconstrictive effects of the previously administered
epinephrine.
during myocardial hypoxia, increased adenosine
production occurs, due to massive amp dephosphorylation in hypoxic myocardial cells. adenosine decreases camp production by activating an inhibitory

 xxxd1998xxx  for treatment of cardiac arrest

guanine nucleotide-binding (gi) protein. this produces negative inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic
effects (12).  xxxd150xxx , a non-specific pde inhibitor, has adenosine antagonist properties, and for that
reason it has been investigated as a potentially useful
drug for the treatment of bradyasystolic cardiac arrest
(13), although its benefits on patient survival have not
been clearly demonstrated. moreover,  xxxd150xxx 
reverses the potential lethal effects of propranolol
overdose in animals (14) and has been considered as
a potential antidote against beta-blocker intoxication
(15).  xxxd1998xxx  also exerts a similar inhibitory effect
on the adenosine receptor, on which it binds with
low absolute affinity but with higher affinity than
other pdeiii inhibitors (16). anti-adenosine activity of
pdeiii inhibitors probably acts synergistically with
pdeiii inhibition (17) but its contribution to clinical
effects is unknown.
an alternative treatment to  xxxd1998xxx  in our cases
could have been glucagon, which has been used
successfully to treat both overdose (18) and adverse
effects (19) from beta-blockers. we did not use
glucagon because it was not available in our hospital
at that time. the use of glucagon for the treatment of
cardiac arrest associated with beta-blockers has never
been reported.

conclusion
results of these two case reports indicate that  xxxd1998xxx  can be useful in beta-blocker-induced cardiac
arrest when standard treatment has failed, because of
its beta-receptor independent effects. the potential
role of  xxxd1998xxx  and other pdeiii inhibitors as
antidotes for the treatment of beta-blocker overdose
deserves further investigation.
