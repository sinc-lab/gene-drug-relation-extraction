introduction

autism spectrum disorder (asd) is a developmental syndrome
observed before three years of age. children and adults with
asd are markedly inattentive to faces, show poorer facial

identity discrimination and fixate less to the eye region (sigman
et al., 1986; klin et al., 1999). although individuals with autism
are not incapable of attending to the face, when they do, they
may process the information in much the same manner as
inanimate objects (hobson et al., 1988; schultz et al., 2000).

faces are multi-dimensional stimuli conveying complex
social and motivational signals simultaneously. functional
brain-imaging studies have delineated an extensive network
implicated in face processing in humans, including the
fusiform gyrus, and several limbic system regions such as
the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate
cortex (kanwisher et al., 1997; haxby et al., 2000; ishai et al.,
2000). regions within this network are associated with
functions related to socio-emotional processing. for example,
the posterior cingulate cortex (pcc) is active during simple
emotions driven by faces (fink et al., 1996; shah et al., 2001).
interactions between emotion and face perception may
provide insights into more general mechanisms underlying
reciprocal links between emotion and cognitive processes and
the dysfunction of this network in autism.
the etiology of autism is poorly defined both at the
cellular and the molecular level. despite considerable effort
toward the identification of chromosome regions affected in
autism, only a few genes have been reproducibly shown to
display specific mutations (e.g. schroer et al., 1998; nakatani
et al., 2009). a number of genetic studies have implicated
subunits of the gabaa receptor, suggesting that gaba
changes can influence the developmental trajectory of the
brain in autism (schroer et al., 1998; fatemi et al., 2009).
 xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase 65 and 67 ( xxxg850xxx ,  xxxg849xxx ), key
enzymes for gaba synthesis, is decreased in the cortex and
altered in the cerebellum (fatemi et al., 2002, yip et al., 2007,
2008, 2009). furthermore, gabaa receptors and benzodiazepine binding sites are decreased in limbic regions (blatt et al.,
2001; guptill et al., 2007; oblak et al., 2009). additionally,
protein levels for gabaa receptor subunits are reduced in
multiple cortical areas (fatemi et al., 2009). together, these
findings suggest that alterations in gaba system, can
potentially affect cortical circuit formation.
the gabaa receptor contains a combination of five
subunits and has binding sites for many modulators
including benzodiazepines (bzds). benzodiazepine binding
sites are allosteric modulatory sites on gabaa receptors and
benzodiazepines have been used as anxiolytics, muscle
relaxants, sedatives, and anticonvulsants (sieghart, 1992).
co-morbid seizure disorder is relatively common in autism
and has been estimated to occur in 25–33% of individuals
(olsson et al., 1988; volkmar and nelson, 1990). the present
study examined two regions within the socio-emotional
processing network, the fusiform gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex to determine whether a common deficit in gabaa
receptors and its benzodiazepine binding sites occurs in the
autism group relative to controls. a discussion of how results
might contribute to the underlying face-processing and
social behavior deficits in autism follows.

results

overall there were significant reductions in the number of
gabaa receptors and benzodiazepine binding sites in both
areas in the group of patients with autism when compared to
the controls. furthermore, the kd in the patients with autism
was significantly lower than controls in the superficial layers
of gabaa receptors indicating an increased binding affinity.

individual case information for bmax and kd values for both
gabaa and  xxxd1459xxx  binding is available in the supplementary
data (tables 1–3).

gabaa receptor binding

2.1.1.

posterior cingulate cortex

fig. 1 is a pseudocolored image of a control and autism cases
demonstrating reduced 3h-muscimol labeled gabaa receptor
binding. multiple concentration binding experiments revealed
that all autistic cases fell below the mean bmax value for
control cases in the superficial layers of the posterior cingulate
cortex. the results from the seven concentration binding
studies indicate a significant reduction of gabaa receptors
(bmax) in the superficial layers (p = 4.0 × 10− 6) of the posterior
cingulate cortex in the group of patients with autism (n = 7)
when compared to age- and post-mortem interval (pmi)
matched controls (n = 6; fig. 2). the bmax values demonstrate
that there was a 49.0% reduction in gabaa receptors.

2.1.2.

fusiform gyrus

fig. 1 is a pseudocolored image demonstrating the reduced
3
h-muscimol labeled gabaa receptors in the ffg. similar to
the pcc results, all autism cases fell below the mean of the
control group in the superficial layers. the multiple concentration binding experiments in the fusiform gyrus demonstrated significant reductions in individuals with autism
(n = 8) for the number of gabaa receptors (bmax value) in the
superficial layers (p = 5.20 × 10− 6) when compared to controls
(n = 10; fig. 3). the bmax values indicated that there was a
31.2% reduction in the number of gabaa receptors. similar to

posterior cingulate cortex

fusiform gyrus

the multiple concentration binding assays demonstrated
significant reductions in the number of  xxxd1459xxx  binding sites in
the fusiform gyrus in patients with autism (p = 0.0052; n = 8)
when compared to controls (n = 10; figs. 2 and 4), and values
for all individuals with autism were below the mean of the
control group in the superficial layers only. the reduction in
the number of binding sites was calculated to be 27.2% in
autism. in contrast to the results in the pcc, there was a
significant 21.5% reduction in the number of  xxxd1459xxx  binding sites
in the deep layers of the ffg in the individuals with autism
(p = 0.017). no significant difference in binding affinity was
found in this study (fig. 4).

the results from the seven concentration binding studies
indicated a significant decrease in the bmax values in the
superficial layers (p = 4.00 × 10− 6) of the posterior cingulate
cortex in autism (fig. 3). the multiple concentration binding
study revealed a 35.0% reduction in benzodiazepine binding
sites in the superficial layers in individuals with autism, but
equivalent values for the deep layers. fig. 2 is a pseudocolored
image that demonstrates the reduced  xxxd1459xxx  binding density.
again, all patients with autism fell below the mean of the
control cases. there was no significant difference observed in
binding affinity (fig. 3).

in the posterior cingulate cortex, four of the cases had a
reported history of at least one seizure. a non-parametric
mann–whitney u test was completed to determine if the
history of seizure in the autism group had any effect on the
number of gabaa receptors or  xxxd1459xxx  binding sites. no
significant difference between the patients with autism with
a history of seizure and the patients with autism with no
history of seizure was found in either the gabaa or  xxxd1459xxx  study.
in the fusiform gyrus study, four of the cases had a reported
history of seizure. again, using a mann–whitney u test, there
was no difference between the autism cases with a history of
seizure and the autism cases with no history of seizure in
either of the gabaa or  xxxd1459xxx  studies.
there was a significant difference in the binding affinity in
the superficial layers of both the pcc and ffg in the 3hmuscimol study. the individuals with autism demonstrated a
significantly lower kd, similar to that found in the posterior
cingulate cortex and fusiform gyrus (figs. 3 and 4). there was
no difference in binding affinity between the autism group
with a history of seizure when compared to the autism group
with no seizure.

discussion

each region within the extensive network of face and
emotional processing may underlie separate and functionally specific processes (adolphs et al., 2003). autism may be
characterized by multiple disruptions to individual processes
or deficits could arise from a single impairment with
cascading deleterious effects on the downstream processing
of specific social cues. the downstream effects could occur
directly, via disruptions in typical patterns of information
flow or could occur indirectly, via disrupting the normal

accumulation of socially relevant experiences (schultz,
2005). in this study, we investigated the gabaa receptor
system in the posterior cingulate cortex and fusiform gyrus
and discuss how altered inhibitory modulation within the
network might affect the ability to properly process socioemotional behaviors.

3.1.

gaba in development and dysfunction in autism

most theories regarding amino acid neurotransmitters in
autism suggest that the gabaergic system is suppressed,
resulting in excessive stimulation of the glutamate system
(e.g. rubenstein and merzenich, 2003; hussman, 2001). this
can be attributed to several findings. first, researchers found
abnormalities in cellular development in the limbic system
and cerebellum postmortem (kemper and bauman, 1993;
raymond et al., 1996). secondly, glutamate activity peaks
during the second year of life (kornhuber et al., 1989), a time
when symptoms of autism emerge. a hyperfunctional
system could result in increased release of gaba from
interneurons, resulting in a compensatory downregulation
of receptors.
gabaa receptor activation can influence dna synthesis in
proliferative cells (loturco et al., 1995), cell motility and
morphological development in early postmitotic neurons
(barbin et al., 1993; behar et al., 1996; marty et al. 1996). there
are a number of studies that report that the development of
the cerebral cortex is abnormal in autism. bailey et al. (1998)
found irregular laminar patterning in the frontal cortex, with

abnormally oriented pyramidal cells, increased white matter
neurons, and increased neurons in layer i. irregular laminar
patterning has been found in the anterior cingulate cortex in
autism (simms et al., 2009). the frontal cortex and anterior
cingulate cortex has previously been found to exhibit
decreased protein levels for gabaa receptor subunits (fatemi
et al., 2009) in autism as well as reduced gabaa receptors and
 xxxd1459xxx  binding sites (oblak et al., 2009).

3.2.
face-processing abnormalities in autism: the role of
the ffg and pcc
there is converging evidence in non-human primates and
humans that eyes are viewed more frequently than any other
region of the face when viewed in an upright manner (hirata
et al., 2010; farroni et al., 2006). however, little is known
about the specific visual properties of faces that activate the
ffg, what neural interactions within the ffg underlie face
processing, and how accumulated experience and other
brain regions may shape the development and dysfunction
of the ffg in autism. an important component of face
recognition is emotion processing. the recognition of facial
expressions of emotion is thought to develop slowly during
the first two years of life, a time frame when the symptoms of
autism become apparent, and continue to mature into
adolescence.
the posterior cingulate cortex appears preferentially
involved in visuospatial cognition (olson and musil, 1992;
olson et al., 1996), and is part of a network recruited when

fig. 2 – 3h-flunitrazepam labeled benzodiazepine binding site density in the pcc (a,b) and ffg (c, d) from two patients with
autism and two control cases. case numbers are below each image. images are taken from 3h sensitive film (concentration
5 nm). there is reduced binding density in individuals with autism (b,d) when compared to the control (a,c) cases in both the
pcc and ffg. note the variability in binding between cases within a group.

typically developing subjects see the faces or hear the
voices of emotionally significant people in their lives
(maddock et al., 2001) and modulates emotion by responding
to emotional scripts and faces (mayberg et al., 1999).
individuals with autism are known to have difficulties in
the perception of faces and direction of eye gaze, lack of eye
contact and impairments in face recognition abilities, failing
to use eye gaze and facial expression to regulate social
interaction (braverman et al., 1989; davies et al., 1994; joseph
and tanaka, 2003).
early studies of adults with asd compared to controls
found evidence for reduced ffg activation and greater
object–area activation by faces, even though measures of
attention to the faces were similar (schultz et al., 2000; pierce
et al., 2001; hubl et al., 2003). the apparent failure of
individuals with asd to develop normal cortical face
specialization in the fusiform gyrus and “expertise” in face
recognition may be the accumulated effect of reduced social
interest and lack of motivation to view faces (schultz et al.,
2000; pierce et al., 2001; hubl et al., 2003). however, other
studies found ffg activation by faces that was modulated by
personal familiarity in asd (pierce et al., 2004), or ffg
activation that was indistinguishable from controls. using
eye-tracking, a recent study suggested that this disparity of
findings might be explained by differences in fixation
behavior (dalton et al., 2005).

the current study found significant reductions in the
number of gabaa receptors and  xxxd1459xxx  binding sites in the
superficial layers of the pcc, the layers that actively modulate
information that arrives from other cortical and/or thalamic
regions within the circuit. it is likely that synaptic information
entering the superficial layers of the pcc is being modulated in
a different manner than controls. this information is then
passed on to the deep layers and sent to higher order cortical
regions to be processed. the modulation in the pcc at this
level seems to be intact as there were no differences in gabaa
receptor or  xxxd1459xxx  binding site number. significant reductions in
the number of gabaa receptors and  xxxd1459xxx  binding sites in the
superficial layers and a reduction in  xxxd1459xxx  binding sites in the
deep layers of the ffg were also demonstrated. this suggests
that, similar to the pcc findings, information about emotion
from faces and eye gaze, entering the ffg from cortical regions
could also be abnormal in autism.
in contrast, the deep layers of the ffg in the autism group
have a normal number of gabaa receptors. thus, the
information is being sent further downstream with the same
gabaa modulation as controls, but the information that is
received from the superficial layers is modulated with less
inhibitory control. the resultant output in the autistic brain
could be substantially different thereby leading to reduced
face and emotion processing. therefore, relevant neurochemical or neuroanatomical events may occur relatively early in

socio-emotional processing.

3.3.
effects of seizures and anti-epileptic medication on
bmax and kd values of gabaa and  xxxd1459xxx  binding
a significant reduction in the  xxxd1459xxx  binding site number was
found in the superficial layers of the pcc and throughout the ffg
in the autism cases paralleled by a change in the binding affinity.
alterations in gabaa receptor subunit expression are documented in human epilepsy (loup et al., 2000, 2006) and in animal
models of epilepsy (gilby et al., 2005; li et al., 2006). the evidence
from these studies suggests that a shift in mrna subunit
expression can occur such that the  xxxg833xxx  subunit is increased, but
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  is decreased (brooks-kayal et al., 2009). if this were the case in
autism, it is likely that the number of [3h]-muscimol and [3h]flunitrazepam binding sites would not decrease in parallel, as
alpha-4 containing gabaa receptors bind [3h]muscimol, but do
not contain a [3h]flunitrazepam binding site.
in the superficial layers of the pcc and ffg, the number of
[3h]-musicmol binding sites was also decreased, arguing
that the decrease in [3h]-flunitrazepam binding was due to
a loss of receptors rather than subunit switching. however,
in the deep layers of the ffg, the number of [3h]-flunitrazepam
binding sites was not paralleled by a reduced number of

[3h]-muscimol receptor binding. this would argue that it is
possible for subunit switching to occur here, in an area prone
to seizure, the temporal lobe, however; the binding affinity
was not altered in the deep layers. furthermore, the binding
affinity of autism cases with a history of seizure did not differ,
indicating that the change in affinity is most likely due to the
autism diagnosis. however, this conclusion is tentative due to
the small number of cases that had a positive seizure history.
these results do not rule out the possibility that changes
occur in other regions of the brain that might be more
susceptible to epileptiform activity. therefore, it will be
important for future studies to control for seizure and
antiepileptics, and increase the number of subjects.
in summary, there are a number of possible explanations
for the reduction in gabaa receptors and  xxxd1459xxx  binding sites in
the brains of individuals with autism. first, the reduction in
gabaa receptors and  xxxd1459xxx  binding is a consistent deficit in
autism, with similar findings in the hippocampus and
anterior cingulate cortex (blatt et al., 2001; guptill et al.,
2007; oblak et al., 2009) suggesting widespread gaba
receptor abnormalities in the autistic cases, irrespective of
seizure and medication history. second, it is possible that a
defect in one or more of the gabaa receptor subunits exists.
fatemi et al. (2009) found reduced proteins in three of the
gabaa receptor subunits in autism in multiple cortical
regions and genetic studies found significant association

epigenetic studies are needed to determine whether deficits
in subunit composition are in part contributing to the
reduced gabaa receptor binding in autism.

case data

the following is a list of cases used in the study (tables 1 and
2). there were a total of 15 post-mortem cases from patients
with autism (7 for the pcc study, 8 for the ffg study) and 17
controls (7 for the pcc study, 10 for the ffg study). the
patients with autism ranged in age from 14–37 years and
the controls ranged from 16–43 years. the post-mortem
interval (pmi) was less than 30 h for all cases. there was
no difference between individuals with autism and control
group in age or pmi (student's t-test). note that seven of
fifteen cases (pcc and ffg) from the individuals
with autism had a history of at least one seizure (1484, 2825,
3845, 3924, 5173, 6337, 6677). also, four of the cases (pcc and
ffg) from the patients with autism were treated with anticonvulsants (2825, 3845, 5173, 6677). there were seven
individuals with autism and six control cases for pcc study;
and nine cases from patients with autism and ten control

cases from the ffg. all cases used in the study had an autism
diagnosis of moderate to severe.

regions of interest

4.2.1.

posterior cingulate cortex (pcc; brodmann area 23)

the pcc (ba 23) has a prominent layer iv and a less prominent
layer v (vogt et al., 1995) when compared to the adjacent
anterior cingulate cortex. the pcc consists of areas 23a, 23b,
23d, which reside at the surface of the posterior cingulate
gyrus. area 23c lies in the ventral bank of the caudal cingulate
sulcus (vogt and pandya, 1987; vogt et al., 2005). areas 23a and
23b are divided into ventral and dorsal. these regions are
differentiated from each other on the basis of cytoarchitecture
and connectivity and are functionally distinct (goldman-rakic
et al., 1984; morris et al., 1999; vogt et al., 2005). it is suggested
that both the ventral and dorsal areas of 23a/b contribute to
spatial memory (maguire, 2001). however, ventral area 23a/b
may contribute to verbal and auditory memory (rudge and
warrington, 1991). for the purposes these studies, only area
23 is considered, and not the subregions or the dorsal/ventral
dichotomy. blocks from the posterior cingulate were removed
at the brain bank, and nissl stained sections were used to
differentiate ba 23 from the surrounding areas (vogt et al.,
2006). in order to reduce heterogeneity within the region,
every effort was made to match the levels of the blocks
removed from the brain bank.

4.2.2.

fusiform gyrus (ffg; brodmann area 37)

the fusiform gyrus (occipitotemporal gyrus) extends the
length of the inferior occipitotemporal surface, bound
medially by the parahippocampal gyrus and laterally by the
occipitotemporal gyrus in humans. ba 37 is a subdivision of
the cytoarchitectually defined temporal region of cerebral
cortex, located primarily in the caudal portions of the
fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus. the fusiform
gyrus was identified on tissue at the brain bank as follows:
the medial margin was defined by the collateral and rhinal
sulci and the lateral boundary was identified as the sulcus
medial to the inferior temporal gyrus (mcdonald et al., 2000).
von economo and koskinas (1927) has characterized the
fusiform gyrus with the following feature: (1) layer i is
slightly thicker on average than other cortical regions;
(2) layer ii is not densely packed, containing mostly granule
cells and also some pyramidal cells; (3) layer iii is relatively
thick and richer in cells; (4) layer iv is compact with large
granule cells; (5) layer v is divided into a thin superficial
sublayer va and is composed of densely packed, small,
triangular cells, and a deeper sublayer vb with large cells;

(6) layer vi is relatively thin and has a compact layer via
with large triangular and spindle shaped neurons and a
deeper layer vib which is thinner than other areas but
contains spindle cells. although the ffg has been attributed
to several functions including processing of color information, word and number recognition as well as face and body
recognition (allison et al., 1994; kanwisher et al., 1997), there
have not been reports of regions subserving these functions
having different cytoarchitectonic patterning. therefore, the
blocks of tissue were taken from similar levels of the ffg, the
lateral side of the mid-fusiform gyrus, which has been shown
in imaging literature to be responsible for face-processing
(kanwisher et al., 1997) and the entire ffg region was
sampled from each block.

4.3.

multiple-concentration binding assays

tissue blocks were coronally sectioned at 20 mum using a
hacker/brights motorized cryostat at −20 °c. the sections
were thaw mounted on 2 × 3 in. gelatin coated glass slides.
two sections from each case were used to determine total

binding and one section from each case was used to
determine non-specific binding for each of seven concentrations. the ligand used for gaba a receptors was [3 h]muscimol (specific activity 36.6 curies/millimole; ci/mmol;
new england nuclear) and the ligand for  xxxd1459xxx  binding sites
was [3h]-flunitrazepam (specific activity 87.2 ci/mmol; new
england nuclear). non-specific binding was measured by
adding a competitive displacer (see table 3) to the tritiated
ligand and buffer solution at a high concentration. the
selected sections from all cases were assayed in parallel in
order to eliminate variability in binding conditions. slides
were dried overnight under a cool stream of air, loaded into xray cassettes with a tritium standard (amersham) and
apposed to tritium-sensitive film (3h-hyperfilm, kodak).
once the exposure time elapsed, the films were developed
for 4 min with kodak d19 developer, fixed with kodak
rapidfix (3 min) at room temperature, and allowed to air
dry. slides were stained with thionin to determine cytoarchitecture and laminar distribution of the posterior cingulate

cortex and fusiform gyrus. superficial layers corresponded to
cortical layers i–iv and deep layers to layers v–vi.

4.4.

data analysis

using an inquiry densitometry system (loats associates), the
film autoradiograms were digitized to gather quantitative
measurements of optical density. the superficial and deep
layers were sampled from each case. the tritiated standards
that were exposed with the sections were used to calibrate
the autoradiograms to quantify the amount of ligand bound
per milligram of tissue in the tissue sections. optical density
for the standards, as a function of specific activity (corrected
for radioactive decay), was fitted to the equation optical
density = b1 ⁎ (1 − 10 k1(specific activity)) + b3, by nonlinear least
squares regression, adjusting the values of the parameters
k1, b1, and b3 using the solver tool of excel (microsoft office
xp professional) to construct a standard curve and to convert
the measured optical densities into nci/mg. binding in

br a i n r es e a rc h 1 3 8 0 ( 2 01 1 ) 2 1 8 –2 28

femtomoles per milligram of tissue (fmol/mg) was calculated
based on the specific activity of each ligand.

4.5.

statistical analyses

specific binding of the tritiated ligands in the superficial and
deep layers from each case was fitted independently with a
hyperbolic binding equation to estimate binding affinity (kd)
and number of receptors (bmax) for each region. examples of
binding curves are shown in figs. 5 and 6. least-squares
fitting was carried out via the microsoft excel solver tool. bmax
data is reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (sem).
kd is reported as the geometric average (kd)av = 10x, where x =
mean(log(kd)), ± semav, where semav = ((10(x+s) - 10(x-s))/2,
where x = mean(logkd) and s = the sem of the log (kd) values.
student's t-tests with unequal variances were performed to
determine if there was a significant difference between
patients with autism and control cases in the superficial
and deep layers of the pcc and ffg. mann–whitney u nonparametric tests were carried out to determine if the number of
gabaa receptors and  xxxd1459xxx  binding sites in cases from patients
with autism with a history of seizure differed from those
patients with autism with no history of seizure using p < 0.05 as
criterion. note that the number of cases that received anticonvulsant therapy did not meet criterion for statistical testing.
