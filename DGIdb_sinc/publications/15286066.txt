background hyperprolactinaemia
induced by d2 dopamine receptor
antagonist antipsychotic medication can
result in significant health problems.
aims to examine the role of  xxxg656xxx 
polymorphism on prolactin levels in
patients treated with antipsychotic
medication.
method antipsychotic drugs with
different degrees of  xxxg656xxx  binding
were given to144 patients with
schizophrenia. serum prolactin levels
were obtained and taq1a
taq1a  xxxg656xxx  alleles
were determined.
results prolactin levels increased
across medication groups reflecting
increasingly tight  xxxg656xxx  binding
(clozapine, olanzapine, typical
antipsychotics and risperidone).in the
combined medication group, patients with
the  xxxg656xxx *a1allele
 xxxg656xxx *a1 allele had 40% higher
prolactin levels than patients withoutthis
allele.in patients treated with clozapine
(the loosest  xxxg656xxx  binding agent),
patients with the  xxxg656xxx *a1allele
 xxxg656xxx *a1 allele had
prolactin levels twice those of patients
withoutthis allele.
conclusions patients withthe drd2a1
allele receiving antipsychotic medications
had higher prolactin levels and were
overrepresented among those with
hyperprolactinaemia, suggesting greater
functional  xxxg656xxx  binding in this
group.

hyperprolactinaemia is a frequent adverse
effect of antipsychotic medication (petty,
1999), and is the result of d2 dopamine
receptor drug binding (markianos et al,
al,
2001). hyperprolactinaemia may result in
depression, sexual dysfunction, amenorrhoea, galactorrhoea, breast cancer and osteoporosis (maguire, 2002; halbreich et al,
al,
2003). antipsychotic drugs vary widely in
their binding affinity for the  xxxg656xxx .
clozapine and quetiapine, with a lower
binding affinity than dopamine (remington
et al,
al, 2000), have not been associated with
hyperprolactinaemia (markianos et al,
al,
2002). hyperprolactinaemia is typically
associated with tighter-binding agents such
as risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic,
whereas olanzapine, an antipsychotic with
intermediate binding, is associated with a
modest increase in prolactin levels (david
et al,
al, 2000). the a1 allele of the d2 dopamine receptor gene ( xxxg656xxx 
( xxxg656xxx )) is associated
with significantly reduced density of d2 receptors (noble et al,
al, 1991) and thus may
influence  xxxg656xxx  antagonism. this
study reports the effect of  xxxg656xxx  polymorphism on prolactin response to a
variety of antipsychotic medications.

method
sample
patients were recruited at the fortitude
valley community mental health centre,
the royal brisbane mental health unit
and the park psychiatric hospital. inclusion
criteria were age 18–65 years and meeting
dsm–iv criteria for schizophrenia (american psychiatric association, 1994). potential participants were excluded if they had
schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder,
dementia, organic brain syndrome, major
depressive disorder with delusions or
epilepsy. those who were pregnant were
excluded. as a range of psychoactive agents
can influence prolactin levels (jarvinen et
al,
al, 1992; hugues et al,
al, 2000; basturk et

al,
al, 2001; keltner et al,
al, 2002), patients regularly taking antidepressant, opiate, anxiolytic or mood-stabilising medication were
excluded from the study. potential participants who nursing or medical staff believed
were not adhering to their medication regimen were also excluded. all participants
provided informed consent and were able
to terminate participation without prejudice. institutional ethics approval was
obtained from the clinics and hospitals
involved.

assessments
a total of 144 unrelated white patients
(123 men, 21 women), attending various
psychiatric units for the treatment of their
schizophrenia, were enrolled in the study.
their average age was 36.4 years (s.d.¼
(s.d.
12.0); 61 participants were in-patients and
83 were out-patients. a clinical history
was taken by either a psychiatrist (s.b.,
b.l., m.b., w.w.) or a clinical psychologist
(r.y.). demographic details including
ethnic background data were obtained.
the positive and negative syndrome scale
(panss; kay, 1990) was used to assess
psychotic symptoms. all raters were trained
to a criterion of 90% agreement using
panss training videos. interrater reliability
was obtained through random checks of the
panss by independent raters of the same
patient. these reliabilities were sound.

medications
all participants received their prescribed
antipsychotic medication for at least 1
month at a stable dosage. thirty-one
patients were prescribed clozapine, 31 olanzapine, 33 typical antipsychotics (12
 xxxd2137xxx , 2 fluphenazine  xxxd1821xxx , 13
 xxxd3568xxx , 3 haloperidol  xxxd1821xxx , 1
thioridazine, 1  xxxd3359xxx  and 1  xxxd3431xxx ) and 49 risperidone. antipsychotic
dosage was transformed to chlorpromazine
equivalents per kilogram. the mean
chlorpromazine equivalent dosages in the
four medication groups were clozapine
5.14 mg/kg
(s.d.¼2.94),
(s.d. 2.94),
olanzapine
5.37 mg/kg (s.d.¼2.62),
(s.d. 2.62), typicals 5.60 mg/kg
(s.d.¼3.70)
(s.d. 3.70) and risperidone 4.82 mg/kg
(s.d.¼2.00).
(s.d. 2.00). there was no significant difference in dosage among the four drug groups
(f(3,128)¼0.51,
(3,128) 0.51, p¼0.67).
0.67). adherence by
the in-patients was sound as all medication
was administered by nursing staff; outpatient adherence was estimated by selfreport and assessment by the treating psychiatrist. thirty of the 33 patients receiving

typical medication were treated with
nurse-administered depot preparations.

prolactin levels and  xxxg656xxx  alleles
a 10 ml blood sample was drawn from each
participant for dna extraction and prolactin determination. the dna was sent
to the university of california los angeles
for genotyping, and prolactin determination was conducted at the royal
brisbane hospital. serum prolactin level
was determined by a heterogeneous sandwich magnetic separation assay (immuno
1 system; bayer diagnostics, newbury,
berkshire, uk) which was standardised
against the world health organization
3rd irp 84/500 reference manual.
dna was extracted from leucocytes
using standard techniques and subsequently
used as a template for determination of
taq1a
taq1a  xxxg656xxx  alleles by the polymerase
chain reaction (grandy et al,
al, 1993). as
previously described (noble et al,
al, 1994),
the amplification of dna was carried out
using a perkin elmer geneamp 9600
thermocycler (perkin elmer, boston, ma,
usa). approximately 500 ng of amplified
dna was then digested with 5 units of
taq1
taq1 restriction enzyme (gibco/brl,
grand island, ny, usa) at 658
658c overnight.
the resulting products were analysed by
electrophoresis in a 2.5% agarose gel
containing ethidium bromide and visualised
under ultraviolet light. the a1/a2 genotype
is revealed by three fragments (310 bp,
180 bp and 130 bp) and the a2/a2 genotype by two fragments (180 bp and
130 bp); the a1/a1 genotype is shown by
the uncleaved 310 bp fragment. participants with a1/a1 and a1/a2 genotypes
were considered to have a1+allelic status
and those with the a2/a2 genotype were
considered to have a17 allelic status.

groups. a p value of 40.05 was considered
to be statistically significant.

results
the results confirmed a significant gender
effect in prolactin levels of patients treated
with antipsychotic medications. female
participants had significantly higher prolactin levels than males (f
(f(1,142)¼25.19,

and for males being 420 miu/l (s.d.¼374).
(s.d. 374).
men and women were equally represented

hyperprolactinaemia is defined using
community sample cut-off levels set at a
95% reference range: 5430 mu/l in men
and 5560 mu/l in women (vanderpump
et al,
al, 1998). in total, 64 patients, 44% of
the sample, exceeded these levels. only 7
of these patients were prescribed lowerbinding agents (clozapine and olanzapine)
confirming that these medications are
rarely associated with hyperprolactinaemia
(5% of the sample). forty of the patients
on risperidone exceeded these prolactin levels, indicating that 81% of patients on this
medication were in the hyperprolactinaemic range. a yates’-corrected w2 analysis
conducted to compare allelic status in the
group with prolactin levels in the normal
range and those with hyperprolactinaemia
was significant (w
(w2(1)¼5.52,
(1) 5.52, p¼0.02).
0.02).
those with a1+ allelic status were significantly overrepresented in the group of
patients with clinical hyperprolactinaemia.

discussion
prolactin response to antipsychotic medication was greatest in patients prescribed
risperidone. prolactin response was successively lower in patients administered typical
antipsychotics, olanzapine and clozapine.
this order across medications has also been
found in positron emission tomography
binding studies (e.g. markianos et al,
al,

2001) where d2 dopamine receptor
occupancy corresponded to serum prolactin
levels. prolactin levels were higher in
women than in men.
individuals with the a1 allele and
higher prolactin levels when treated with
antipsychotic medication and were overrepresented among patients with clinical
hyperprolactinaemia. the a1+ participants
also had significantly higher prolactin levels
than a17 participants when treated with
the loosely binding agent clozapine. the
greater prolactin response to antipsychotics
observed in a1+ patients with schizophrenia in this and other studies (mihara
et al,
al, 2000, 2001) may be the result of
a1+ individuals having fewer unbound
dopamine receptors at any given antipsychotic dose. our results indicate that
in addition to the  xxxg656xxx  binding dissociation constant of antipsychotic medications, individual  xxxg656xxx  density is
also important in determining prolactin
response to antipsychotic agents.
individuals with the a1 allele have a reduced density of brain d2 receptors (noble
et al,
al, 1991; thompson et al,
al, 1997; phjalainen et al,
al, 1998; jonsson et al,
al, 1999). an
early brain autopsy study (noble et al,
al,
1991) found a significant reduction of
approximately 30% in the number of d2
dopamine receptors (b
(bmax) in the caudate
nucleus of a1+ compared with a17 subjects; there was no difference in d2 binding
affinity (k
(kd) between the two allelic groups.
thompson et al (1997) also reported a
30–40% reduction in  xxxg656xxx  density in
the striatum of a1+ compared with a17
individuals. an in vivo study of healthy
finnish volunteers (pohjalainen et al,
al,
1998) showed significantly decreased d2
receptor density in the striatum of a1+
compared with a17 individuals, with no
difference in kd between the two groups.

in another positron emission tomography
study of healthy humans using [11c]labelled raclopride (jonsson et al,
al, 1999), a
significant association of the a1 allele was
found with low  xxxg656xxx  density. taq1a
taq1a
 xxxg656xxx  variants are now known to be in linkage disequilibrium with c957t, a synonymous mutation in the human  xxxg656xxx  (duan
et al,
al, 2003). furthermore, c957t affects
messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) folding,
leading to a decrease in mrna stability and
a 50% decrease in d2 dopamine receptor
proteins. these effects dramatically diminish
dopamine-induced upregulation of d2 receptors. as a result of fewer d2 receptors at any
dose of antipsychotic medication, a1+ individuals may have a lower density of free,
unbound d2 receptors, and consequently
an enhanced prolactin response.
dopamine receptor drug occupancy
and consequent receptor blockade are
necessary for both clinical antipsychotic
action (kapur & remington, 2001) and a
variety of other effects. studies with conventional antipsychotic drugs report that
approximately 70% occupancy results in
maximal therapeutic efficacy (nordstrom
et al,
al, 1993). a trend towards improved
efficacy in patients with treatment-resistant
schizophrenia was found when doses of
olanzapine were increased to an average
of 30.4 mg (volavka et al,
al, 2002). preliminary investigations have been undertaken to
increase the efficacy of clozapine, an agent
with a high  xxxg656xxx  dissociation constant or loose binding, by adding haloperidol, an agent with a low dissociation
constant (kapur et al,
al, 2001). individuals
lacking the a1 allele may be more likely
to benefit from these approaches to
improve drug  xxxg656xxx  occupancy given
that they may have relatively more free,
unbound, d2 receptors. conversely, a1+
individuals are unlikely to derive as much
improvement from this approach, with
optimal therapeutic effect being likely at
lower dosages in these patients. patients
lacking the a1 allele may require higher
doses for maximal antipsychotic effect,
particularly when prescribed a loosely binding antipsychotic such as clozapine or
quetiapine.
according to the rapid dissociation
model (kapur & seeman, 2001), loosebinding atypical agents are hypothesised
to have an antipsychotic action without
causing other effects of dopamine blockade
such as raised prolactin levels or extrapyramidal side-effects (kapur & seeman, 2001).
our data are not consistent with this,

14 9

youn g e t a l

because clozapine has definite effects on
serum prolactin levels, with a1+ individuals
having significantly raised prolactin levels
compared with a17 patients. the d2
blockade effect of clozapine in a1+ patients
is not limited to an antipsychotic effect
alone.
other clinical parameters influenced by
d2 receptors require investigation. for
example,  xxxg656xxx  occupancy correlates
with liability to extrapyramidal adverse
effects in patients treated with risperidone
(yamada et al,
al, 2002) and a variety of antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine
(broich et al,
al, 1998), haloperidol (kapur et
al,
al, 2000) and olanzapine (jauss et al,
al,
1998). individuals with the a1 allele
treated with antipsychotic medication may
experience extrapyramidal adverse effects
at lower dose than a17 patients, as these
patients have decreased nigrostriatal d2
receptor density (thompson et al,
al, 1997).

limitations of the study
although the total number of patients
investigated is adequate, one of the limitations of this study is the relatively small
number of patients in each medication subgroup. further research involving larger
numbers of patients with each individual
medication is indicated in order to ascertain
whether or not this association occurs with
specific antipsychotic agents. prospective
studies examining the changes in prolactin
levels over time are also recommended.

clinical implications

in patients with schizophrenia, serum prolactin levels increased in proportion to
tightness of antipsychotic medication d2 dopamine receptor binding.

&

patients with the  xxxg656xxx *a1 allele treated with antipsychotic medications had
higher prolactin levels than patients without this allele, and a higher percentage of
patients with the  xxxg656xxx *a1 allele compared with patients without this allele had
hyperprolactinaemia.
&

the a1 allele of  xxxg656xxx  may be a useful clinical marker for identification for those at
risk of hyperprolactinaemia and associated adverse effects.
&

limitations

studies with a larger number of people with schizophrenia in each medication
subgroup are recommended.

&

&

prospective studies examining changes in prolactin levels over time are indicated.

implications of the study
our study implicates the  xxxg656xxx  dissociation constant of the antipsychotic agent
as well as  xxxg656xxx  variants as important
determinants of  xxxg656xxx  blockade
induced by antipsychotic medications.
patients carrying the a1 allele generally display higher prolactin levels, probably as a
result of lower density of free, unbound,
d2 receptors, and may be at increased risk
of adverse effects associated with hyperprolactinaemia. the results demonstrate
that this association is most evident with
the loose  xxxg656xxx  binding antipsychotic
agent, clozapine. future research should
employ this pharmacogenetic approach to
investigate clinical parameters other than
prolactin response. this may result in clinicians being able to optimise antipsychotic
treatment with regard to drug selection,
dose and possible adverse effects.
