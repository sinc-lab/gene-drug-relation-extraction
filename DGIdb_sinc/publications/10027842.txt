intestinal prokinesia by two esters of 4-amino-5-chloro-2-  xxxd2820xxx : involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 receptors and dissociation fro...  in five fasting, conscious dogs, we compared the prokinetic action of two selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 ( xxxg1117xxx ) receptor agonists with low affinity for 5-ht3 receptors ml10302 (2-piperidinoethyl 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoate) and sr59768 (2-[(3s)-3-hydroxypiperidino]ethyl 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoate) in the duodenum and jejunum, using  xxxd1708xxx  as a reference compound. heart rate and rate-corrected qt (qtc) also were monitored to assess whether or not the cardiac effects of  xxxd1708xxx  are shared by other  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists. both ml10302 and sr59768 dose-dependently stimulated spike activity in the duodenum with similar potencies (dose range, 3-300 nmol/kg i.v.; ed50 values: 24 and 23 nmol/kg i.v., respectively), mimicking the effect of  xxxd1708xxx  (30-3000 nmol/kg i.v.). the maximal effect was achieved with the dose of 100 nmol/kg i.v. for both compounds. similar findings were obtained in the jejunum. atropine and gr125487 (1-[2-[(methylsulfonyl)amino]ethyl]-4-piperidinyl-methyl 5-fluoro-2-methoxy-1h-indole-3-carboxylate, selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist), at doses having no effect per se, antagonized intestinal prokinesia by maximal doses of ml10302 and sr59768. neither ml10302 nor sr59768 had any effect on heart rate or qtc at any of the doses tested, whereas  xxxd1708xxx , at the highest dose (3000 nmol/kg), induced tachycardia and lengthened the qtc (p <.01). in conclusion, ml10302 and sr59768 share with  xxxd1708xxx  a similar prokinetic action in the canine duodenum and jejunum in vivo. this effect is mediated by pathways involving activation of  xxxg1117xxx  and muscarinic receptors. unlike  xxxd1708xxx , which induces tachycardia and prolongs the qtc by a mechanism probably unrelated to  xxxg1117xxx  receptor activation, ml10302 and sr59768 are devoid of cardiac effects in this model.
