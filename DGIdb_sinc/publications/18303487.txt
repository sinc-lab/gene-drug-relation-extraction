conversion from dopamine agonists to
cabergoline: an open-label trial in 128
patients with advanced parkinson disease
gurutz linazasoro, md, on behalf of the spanish dopamine agonists
study group*

abstract

and 25% of patients were taking the drug twice a
day.

background:
cabergoline is an ergotic dopamine agonist with
 xxxg656xxx  activity and a very long half-life. this
pharmacological profile may result in clinically
different effects. small clinical trials indicate that
overnight switching from 1 agonist to another can
be performed safely.

conclusions:
switching from pergolide,  xxxd3145xxx , and pramipexole to cabergoline in an overnight schedule is
safe. the observed clinical improvement may be
related to a placebo effect, to the use of low doses
of dopamine agonists, or to a direct effect of
cabergoline.

objective:
to determine safety and efficacy of overnight
switching from dopamine agonists to cabergoline
in patients with advanced parkinson disease (pd).

key words: dopamine agonists, cabergoline,
parkinson disease, motor complications

methods:
patients with advanced pd and motor complications not optimally controlled by levodopa and a
stable dose of bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, and  xxxd3145xxx  were converted to cabergoline overnight. patients were assessed by using an
on-off diary, unified parkinson disease rating
scale (subscales i-iv), parkinson’s disease quality
of life 8 (pdq-8), an ad hoc sleep questionnaire
and an ad hoc off-period severity questionnaire.
all rating scales were administered just before
conversion and after 2, 6, and 12 weeks of treatment, when patients were on an optimal dose of
cabergoline. adverse effects were assessed at every
visit following a check list.
results:
one hundred twenty-eight patients were included
in the trial. forty were on pergolide (mean dose,
2.8 mg/d), 38 on pramipexole (mean dose, 2.1 mg/
d), and 32 on  xxxd3145xxx  (mean dose, 8.1 mg/d).
patients on bromocriptine (n = 18) were excluded
from the analysis because of the small sample size.
three patients reported serious side effects (respiratory arrest, dyskinesias, and face edema and
abdominal pain). twenty-eight patients reported
41 adverse events. twelve patients were withdrawn
due to adverse effects (hallucinations [n = 5],
dyspnea [n = 1], dizziness [n = 4], and vascular
problems [n = 2]). a significant improvement in
assessed parameters was obtained (p g 0.0001).
mean levodopa dose remained unchanged. after 12
weeks, the mean dose of cabergoline was 3.2 mg,

onsiderable differences exist between
dopamine agonists for half-life, affinity
for dopamine receptor subtypes, ergotic character of the molecule, activity at noradrenergic
and serotoninergic receptors, and so on.1
however, as direct comparative studies
between dopamine agonists are scarce and
not adequately designed, it is difficult to
know the clinical significance of these pharmacological differences. nonetheless, some
data suggest that they may result in clinically
different effects. cabergoline is an ergotic
dopamine agonist with preferential d2 agonist effect whose more relevant characteristic
is its long half life (more than 60 hours).2
cabergoline has been shown to be efficacious
in early and late parkinson disease (pd).3y5
when administered to patients recently diagnosed with pd, it can improve motor symptoms and delay the appearance of motor
fluctuations and dyskinesias.3 in patients with
advanced pd and motor complications, cabergoline is used as an adjuvant to levodopa,
reducing the time spent in the off situation

and, thus, producing more stable motor
situations.4y6
a few studies indicate that in patients
whose efficacy waned from 1 dopamine
agonist, renewed benefit may occur after
switchover to another dopamine agonist.7y17
the switch from 1 agonist to another can be
carried out gradually or abruptly. clinical
trials indicate that overnight switching from
1 agonist to another may be performed safely.
the present study was conducted to
determine the safety and efficacy of overnight switching from dopamine agonists to
cabergoline in patients with advanced pd in
real clinical conditions.

methods
patients with idiopathic pd according
to the united kingdom pd brain bank
criteria18 were included in this open, observational, prospective, and multicenter study.
all of them suffered from motor complications not optimally controlled by levodopa
and a stable dose of bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, or  xxxd3145xxx .
all patients stopped the former agonist
on the day after the baseline evaluation and
started cabergoline. patients were switched
to cabergoline overnight according to the following dose equivalency scheme: 1.2 mg of
cabergoline = 1 mg of pramipexole = 1 mg
of pergolide = 10 mg of bromocriptine =
4 mg of  xxxd3145xxx . after this, the dose of
cabergoline can be increased until a maximum of 6 mg/d in 1 or 2 doses or optimal

clinical control was achieved. levodopa dosage can be adjusted if the neurologist considered it necessary. other antiparkinsonian
drugs (selegiline, amantadine, etc) and complementary treatments (antidepressive drugs,
benzodiazepines, etc) were kept unchanged.
the duration of the study was 12 weeks.
patients were assessed by using an onoff diary, unified parkinson disease rating
scale (updrs; subscales iyiv), pdq-8, an ad
hoc sleep questionnaire and an ad hoc offperiod severity questionnaire (table 1). all
rating scales were administered just before
conversion and after 2, 6, and 12 weeks of
treatment, when patients were on an optimal dose of cabergoline. adverse effects were
assessed at every visit following a check list.
results were analyzed by an analysis of
variance and paired student t test. significance in all cases was assigned when p g

on  xxxd3145xxx  (mean dose, 8.1 mg/d) patients
on bromocriptine (n = 18) were excluded
from the analysis because of the small sample
size. demographics of patients are shown in
table 2.
three patients reported serious side effects (respiratory arrest, dyskinesias and face
edema, and abdominal pain). twenty-eight
patients reported 41 adverse events. twelve
patients were withdrawn due to adverse
effects (hallucinations [n = 5], dyspnea [n =
1], dizziness [n = 4], and vascular problems
[n = 2]).
clinical results are summarized in
tables 3 and 4. a significant improvement
in assessed parameters was obtained (p g
0.0001). mean levodopa dose remained
unchanged.
after 12 weeks, the mean dose of
cabergoline was 3.2 mg, and 25% of patients were taking the drug twice a day.
the dose equivalencies calculated from
this trial were pramipexole-cabergoline,
0.7:1; pergolide-cabergoline, 0.9:1; and
 xxxd3145xxx -cabergoline, 2.5:1.

discussion
results of the present study show that
overnight switching from pergolide, bromocriptine, pramipexole, or  xxxd3145xxx  to cabergoline can be safely performed. in addition, a
significant improvement in all performed
evaluations was found. the improvement
was seen since the very beginning of treatment and was maintained over the 12-week
study period. overall, this study confirms
previous data with other dopamine agonists7y17 and emphasizes the role of switch-

ing as a valid option in the current therapy of
patients with pd and motor complications.
importantly, both duration and severity
of off-period motor and nonmotor symptoms
were improved. to our knowledge, this was
the first attempt to include a questionnaire
to assess the severity of motor and nonmotor
symptoms present during the off periods.
this questionnaire is subjective, and further
studies are necessary to establish its true
validity and usefulness. nevertheless, such
efforts will be welcome because it is impossible to accurately assess changes produced
by any intervention in this relevant clinical
aspect of pd with current rating scales. likely, this improvement was reflected in the
quality of life of these patients that was also
significantly ameliorated.
several switching studies have been
performed so far7y17. as the sample size and
methodology were quite different among
these studies, it is difficult to compare
results. some years ago, we carried out a
large study for pramipexole, in which 227
patients were evaluated following a comparable protocol, and we obtained quite similar
results.15
regarding the particular case of cabergoline, shiraishi et al17 switched patients
from bromocriptine or pergolide to cabergoline therapy and investigated its usefulness in
alleviating motor complications. the reason
in making the switching was the presence of
adverse reactions to bromocriptine and pergolide that precluded further dose increments. thirty patients with complicated pd
were switched to cabergoline over a 2- to 4week period (slow switch). hoehn-yahr and
updrs i to iv on and off scores improved,
and the drug was not discontinued due to
adverse reactions in any patient.
reasons for the clinical benefit encountered in our study can be multiple. first, this
was an open-label study, and, therefore, all
weaknesses related to this type of study
design have to be acknowledged. second,
the dosage of cabergoline was flexible (until
a maximum dose of 6 mg/d was achieved)
and adjusted to patients’ needs in each visit.

therefore, it is likely that the improvement
observed was related to a global increase in
the dopaminergic tone. however, dyskinesias were not increased during the study,
although it is likely that dyskinesias are more
related to the way in which striatal dopamine receptors are stimulated, rather than to
the simple increase in the dopaminergic tone.19
in this study, clinical situation and plasmatic
levels of levodopa were compared after its
usual administration and after intraduodenal
infusion. both off periods and dyskinesias were
controlled by the infusion despite higher
plasmatic levels of the drug.19 cabergoline
has a very long half-life, thus providing a continuous stimulation of dopaminergic receptors
that might be the final cause of the observed
reduction in dyskinesias.
third, the switch itself might explain
the observed positive clinical outcome. indeed, our results confirm previous switching
experience with other dopamine agonists
either conducted in an open or double-blind
fashion.7y17 all these studies show that
switching is associated with a clinical
improvement. this is particularly intense
with an overnight switch that seems superior to slow titration.9,11,12,15 this can be
interpreted as a real beneficial effect of this
strategy. finally, a direct effect of cabergoline can explain the results. its extremely
long half-life makes it a very attractive
alternative for patients with complex motor
complications who could benefit from strategies able to continuously stimulate striatal
dopamine receptors. furthermore, individual
patient responses are well known in pd,
which is in keeping with differences in
dopamine receptor subtype distribution and
affinity for dopaminergic drugs.20
tolerance was quite good, comparable
to the one shown by others.2y6,17 in this
setting, it is important to mention that
switching at ‘‘equivalency’’ (following the
recommendations based on previous experience and literature data), and making dose
adjustments thereafter according to the initial response, may contribute decisively to
this lack of relevant side effects.15,21 based

on previous personal experiences with
switching to cabergoline, we were concerned with the possibility of having an
initial worsening of parkinsonian symptomatology related to the pharmacological characteristics of the drug. however, this problem
was not found in the present study. recent
reports of cardiac valvulopathies related to
the use of ergotic dopamine agonists have
produced considerable alarm.22y31 the duration of this study was too short, and it was
not designed to analyze this problem. thus,
we cannot draw any conclusion. nonetheless, only 1 patient was dropped out because
of dyspnea, whose relationship to a cardiac
problem was unknown.
