besides being an antiprogestin, mifepristone ( xxxd2643xxx ) was
recently shown to antagonize oestrogen-dependent growth
in the endometrium. to explore the molecular mechanisms
for this phenomenon, we investigated whether or not the
morphological effects of mifepristone are mediated by the
 xxxg1737xxx  (pr) and whether mifepristone has
disparate effects on the glandular epithelium and stroma.
six groups of hypogonadal, oestrogen-primed cynomolgus
monkeys were treated for 2 weeks with: vehicle only (group
i); mifepristone (group ii); mifepristone plus progesterone
at 0.2 mg/kg (group iii), 1.0 mg/kg (group iv) or 5.0 mg/
kg (group v); and progesterone only (5.0 mg/kg) (group
vi). histomorphological evaluation showed strikingly compacted stroma in the mifepristone-exposed endometria
(group ii), which was partially reversible by additional
progesterone treatment (groups iii–v). glandular proliferation (pseudostratification, glandular mitoses) in mifepristone-treated monkeys was not significantly different from
that in vehicle ( xxxd2037xxx )-treated monkeys, but was inhibited by progesterone-only treatment. cells containing vacuoles were scarce in the mifepristone-exposed endometrium,
but detected frequently in progesterone-exposed endometria, indicating the strong antisecretory effect of mifepristone on glands. we conclude that oestrogen-dependent
oedema in the stroma is antagonized by mifepristone. the
reversal of this effect by progesterone suggests a prmediated mechanism. in glands, mifepristone is antiprogestogenic, but not antioestrogenic. thus, stromal cells may
be the target of antiprogestin-induced inhibition of oedema
and endometrial growth.

of  xxxd2037xxx , followed by a progesterone-dependent secretory
transformation (padykula et al., 1989; okulicz et al., 1997).
the action of both ovarian steroids can be blocked pharmacologically by steroid receptor antagonists, which predictably
disrupt the physiological development of the endometrium
(healy et al., 1983; dukes et al., 1993). consequently, progesterone-dependent secretory transformation of the endometrium
can be blocked by administration of  xxxg1737xxx 
(pr) antagonists such as mifepristone ( xxxd2643xxx ) or onapristone
(zk 98 299) (schaison et al., 1985; batista et al., 1992;
katkam et al., 1995; cameron et al., 1996a, 1997; dockery
et al., 1997; gemzell danielsson et al., 1997), presumably by
competitive antagonism at the pr level (edwards et al., 1995).
surprisingly, recent studies demonstrated that besides being
antiprogestins, mifepristone and onapristone also impair oestrogen-dependent endometrial proliferation in both human and
non-human primates. in separate studies from different laboratories, long-term treatment with mifepristone was found to
produce a thin, atrophic endometrium, even in the presence of
proliferative phase concentrations of  xxxd2037xxx  in cynomolgus
monkeys, rhesus monkeys and humans (brenner and slayden,
1994; hodgen et al., 1994; cameron et al., 1996b). these
effects could be reproduced with the antiprogestin onapristone
(zk 98 299) and a structurally related compound (zk 137
316) which caused endometrial atrophy and stromal compaction
in monkeys (ishwad et al., 1993; katkam et al., 1995; slayden
et al., 1998).
since antiprogestins do not bind to the  xxxg730xxx 
(or), except with negligibly low affinity, this puzzling
phenomenon is now called non-competitive antioestrogenic
activity (wolf et al., 1989). the mechanism mediating the
non-competitive antioestrogenic activity of mifepristone is still
unclear, but it is clearly different from the known intrinsic
agonistic activity of these compounds (gravanis et al., 1985;
berthois et al., 1991) as, in contrast to progestin treatment,
or and pr are upregulated during antiprogestin treatment
(neulen et al., 1990, 1996; slayden and brenner, 1994).
recently, the possibility of a non-genomically mediated mechanism by mifepristone was proposed, based upon experiments
in vitro demonstrating effects of the antiprogestin on macrophage functions that were attributed to antioxidant properties
inherent in the drug’s chemical structure (roberts et al., 1995).
thus, we designed a study to investigate in vivo whether
mifepristone-induced antioestrogenic effects on the morphology of primate endometrium can be antagonized by competition with progesterone at the progesterone level. since in
general, steroid receptor-induced transcriptional effects are
cell-specific, we postulated that antiprogestins modulate prdependent gene regulation differently in the glandular epithe-

monkey was implanted s.c. with a 3-cm silastic capsule (general
medical, newport news, va, usa) packed with crystalline  xxxd2037xxx 
(sigma, st louis, mo, usa), a capsule size shown previously
to maintain serum concentrations of  xxxd2037xxx  within the normal
physiological range for macaques (wolf et al., 1989; greb et al.,
1997). on study day 29 (14 days of  xxxd2037xxx  replacement), and
after a second injection of gnrh agonist, monkeys were randomly
assigned to one of six groups of daily i.m. treatments (three animals
per group) which continued for 14 more days until study day 43:
group i, vehicle (ethanol); group ii, mifepristone (national research
institute for family planning, beijing, china, 1 mg/kg bodyweight);
group iii, mifepristone plus progesterone (sigma; 0.2 mg/kg); group
iv, mifepristone plus progesterone (1.0 mg/kg); group v, mifepristone
plus progesterone (5.0 mg/kg); and group vi, progesterone only (5.0
mg/kg).

treatment-induced changes in the expression of locally acting
growth factors and cytokines mediating the interaction between
stroma and glandular epithelium by paracrine and autocrine
signalling may account for the characteristic morphological
appearance described as ‘non-competitive antioestrogenic
activity’. in order to test this hypothesis, we investigated
whether mifepristone disparately affects the glandular epithelium and stroma with respect to antioestrogenic and antiprogestogenic parameters by histomorphological evaluation of
endometria from steroid-treated monkeys.
materials and methods
animals and study design
eighteen cynomolgus monkeys (macaca fascicularis), each with a
history of normal menstrual cycles for at least 3 months, were housed
in facilities of the division of animal resources at the eastern
virginia medical school, fully accredited by the american association
for the accreditation of laboratory animal care, as described
previously (wolf et al., 1989).
hormonal treatments
the study design is shown in figure 1. each of the 18 monkeys
received a depot preparation of the gonadotrophin releasing hormone
(gnrh) agonist,  xxxd2463xxx  (lupron-depot®, 80 µg/kg bodyweight, s.c.; everyready drugs ltd, new york, ny, usa) between
cycle days 2 and 6 in order to achieve and maintain a hypo-oestrogenic
state (defined as serum  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations ,50 pg/ml). onset

endometrial biopsies and histomorphological evaluation
endometrial biopsies were obtained from all monkeys on study day
43 by taking a wedge section of the uterine fundus at mid-ventral
laparotomy. biopsy samples were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered
formalin for 4–6 h and stored in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs)
until being prepared into 6-µm sections to be processed for haematoxylin and eosin (h&e) staining according to standard histological
techniques. all histomorphological evaluations were performed by
two independent investigators (a.k.s., m.w.), who were blinded to
the hormonal exposure of the tissues.
computer-aided image analysis (caia)
stromal cellular density and the degree of glandular pseudostratification were quantified by an image analysis system. microscope
images (leitz dmr; leica, wetzlar, germany) were digitized to a
163106 colour 6403480 pixel array via a colour video camera (sony
3ccd, model  xxxd1835xxx  930p) connected to a frame grabber in a pc
(quantimet 600, leica). all images were digitized at fixed settings
of microscope and camera after at least 1 h of equipment preheating
in order to obtain homogeneous and constant image illumination
conditions. for each monkey, one endometrial section from the
tissue block which contained the most representative full-thickness
endometrial biopsy was chosen.
stromal oedema was quantified by measuring the area covered by
nuclei in the endometrial stroma similar to the procedure described
by slayden et al. (1993). from each section, several images covering
the entire area beneath the surface epithelium (functionalis layer)
were analysed after transformation of colour images to 256 grey level
images and improving the outline of nuclei by the ‘delineate’ function
of the software. the software allowed custom definition of a certain
darkness threshold above which individual pixels (equivalent to 1.04
µm2) were marked. the threshold was set to a level marking stained
cell nuclei entirely, and was applied uniformly to all images after
deleting the areas covered by glands. stromal oedema (defined as
reciprocal density of stromal nuclei) was calculated by the following
formula: (area of the tissue inside the image – area covered by
glands)/area covered by stromal nuclei.

(10 mg/kg, i.m.) and analysed by commercially available  xxxd2037xxx 
and progesterone radioimmunoassays (icn biomedicals, costa mesa,
ca, usa). the intra- and interassay coefficients of variation (cv)
were 11 and 18% for  xxxd2037xxx , and 10 and 15% for progesterone,
respectively.

this procedure allowed good discrimination between sections
judged by the pathologist as ‘highly oedematous’ versus ‘nonoedematous’ (see figure 2a).
glandular pseudostratification was calculated based upon measurements of individual cross-sectioned glands in the functionalis layer
(3–14 glands/animal, average number of glands/animal, 9.4). for
better discrimination of glandular nuclei, all images were subjected
to the ‘white sharpen’ function of the software. the luminal and
abluminal sides of the glandular cell nuclei were manually encircled
using the computer mouse and marking the area covered by glandular
nuclei. the average distance between the inner and outer circles was
calculated by the software and divided by the average diameter of
individual nuclei in a particular gland. thus, one layer of columnar
epithelium yielded a value of one, a double layer columnar epithelium
resulted in a value of two, etc. (see figure 2b).

determined by the presence of typical cellular fragments as described
by slayden et al. (1993).
glandular pseudostratification and stromal oedema were graded by
a semiquantitative scoring system, as 0 5 none; 1 5 slight; 2 5
moderate; and 3 5 marked.

subjective evaluation
endometrial sections were also evaluated by a gynaecopathologist
using a method similar to that described previously by johannisson
et al. (1982), ghosh et al. (1992) and slayden et al. (1993). in glands,
the number of mitoses, apoptotic bodies and vacuolated cells were
counted and recorded per 1000 gland cells. glandular mitosis was
identified from the presence of condensed chromatin and the absence
of a nuclear membrane. apoptotic bodies in glandular cells were

statistical analysis
to analyse differences in means, one-way analysis of variance
(anova) and two-tailed t-tests with bonferroni–holm correction, if
applicable, were used. a two-way anova with fixed effects was used
to analyse the combined influence of progesterone and mifepristone. to
test for a linear dose-dependent effect of progesterone at a given dose
of mifepristone, linear regression analysis was employed.

endometrial stroma
the highest density of stromal cell nuclei was observed in
treatment group ii, where oestrogen-primed endometrium was
exposed to mifepristone-only treatment. this stromal compaction is reflected in the low oedema index as measured by
caia which was approximately one-half of the oedema index

different dose levels to oestrogen/mifepristone treatment,

containing capsule on study day 15 resulted in peak  xxxd2037xxx 
concentrations of 200–400 pg/ml in all groups, which stabilized
at a plateau between 80–150 pg/ml for the duration of the
study. plasma progesterone concentrations were ,0.3 ng/ml
in groups i and ii. in progesterone-treated animals, the average
plasma progesterone concentrations during i.m. treatments
between study days 29 and 43 were 1.6 6 0.3 ng/ml, 23.0 6
3.9 ng/ml, 33.6 6 3.8 ng/ml and 38.2 6 3.5 ng/ml in groups
iii, iv, v and vi, respectively (figure 6).
discussion
our data indicate that the antiprogestin, mifepristone, antagonizes the action of  xxxd2037xxx  in the endometrial stroma. in
the stroma, cellular density was increased significantly by
mifepristone when compared with oestrogen exposure only.
along with the inhibitory effect on oestrogen-dependent
growth, stromal compaction could be identified as one of the
key morphological features of the antioestrogenic action of
mifepristone. in contrast, mifepristone treatment did not significantly change morphological parameters associated with
oestrogen stimulation in the glandular epithelium. the pseudostratification index as a parameter of glandular proliferation
was only marginally reduced in response to mifepristone
exposure, but was significantly suppressed in progesteronetreated monkeys, in agreement with the known antiproliferative
action of progesterone in glands. hence, with respect to the
described ‘non-competitive antioestrogenic action’, mifepristone treatment affects glandular and stromal morphology
disparately in oestrogen-primed primate endometrium.
in endometrial glands, mifepristone treatment antagonized
progesterone-dependent effects very potently, as would be
expected from an antiprogestin: progesterone-induced vacuolization and inhibition of secretory activity were profoundly
reduced in all mifepristone-containing treatment groups, indicating antagonism of progesterone-induced secretory transformation. this is in agreement with data in humans which
showed that mifepristone treatment inhibits the expression of
the secretory protein  xxxg1659xxx  in the endometrium, even at
doses low enough not to disturb ovarian function (gemzell
danielsson et al., 1997). a single dose of mifepristone adminis-

tered in the early luteal phase was also shown to be sufficient
to block progesterone-dependent reorganization of glandular
epithelial cells at the fine structural level (dockery et al., 1997).
our data could not completely resolve the question as to
whether all mifepristone action in the endometrium is mediated
by the pr. mifepristone-induced stromal compaction was not
completely restored to levels measured in the oestrogen-only
exposed endometrium, even with concomitant progesterone
treatment resulting in high plasma progesterone concentrations.
no clear dose–response relationship with incremental progesterone concentrations was observed with respect to antagonism
of mifepristone action. however, that progesterone was able
to reverse mifepristone-induced stromal compaction is to some
extent in agreement with a pr-mediated mechanism. the
higher affinity of mifepristone for the pr compared with
progesterone (schreiber et al., 1983) might explain why
even the highest dose of progesterone was not sufficient to
antagonize mifepristone-induced stromal compaction completely. the high efficacy of mifepristone administered at a
dose of 1 mg/kg could also be demonstrated in glands where
progesterone-induced vacuolization was blocked completely,
even in the presence of supraphysiological concentrations of
progesterone in serum. progesterone plasma concentrations
were adjusted based upon the experience with previous studies
(wolf et al., 1989; neulen et al., 1996; greb et al., 1997). the
daily regimen resulted in progesterone plasma concentrations of
~ one-tenth (group iii), equal (group iv) and double (groups
v and vi) those of the normal luteal phase (figure 6)
(goodman et al., 1977).
our data also show that histomorphological measurements
by a caia system and quantitative morphometry are useful
tools for the evaluation of steroidal effects on the endometrium,
and to discriminate between stromal and glandular effects.
similar approaches were employed previously by others
(ghosh et al., 1992; slayden et al., 1993; rogers et al., 1996).
our approach was validated by rendering the anticipated results
after  xxxd2037xxx  and progesterone treatments. furthermore,
objective measurement of stromal oedema by caia correlated
with subjective evaluations by an experienced pathologist
(figure 5). this implies that our measurements truly reflect
hormonally induced proliferative and secretory changes of
the endometrium according to established criteria (sternberg,
1992). however, interpretation of the data needs to take into
account the small group sizes (n 5 3).
the inhibitory effects of antiprogestin treatment on  xxxd2037xxx -dependent growth is now well documented in non-human
primates by numerous experiments performed in different
laboratories (brenner and slayden, 1994; hodgen et al., 1994).
whether or not this effect occurs in humans is controversial.
endometrial morphology after daily administration of 50 mg
of mifepristone over a duration of 6 months was described as
being comparable with a chronic unopposed oestrogen effect
(murphy et al., 1995). another study confirmed the antimitogenic effects of mifepristone when administered at 2 mg/day
for 30 days (cameron et al., 1996b). moreover, both in humans
(kettel et al., 1996) and monkeys (grow et al., 1996), the
inhibitory effects of mifepristone were observed in ectopically
growing endometrium (endometriosis).

figure 6. plasma concentrations of  xxxd2037xxx  and progesterone in different treatment groups (n 5 3).

the so-called ‘antioestrogenic action’ of mifepristone and
other antiprogestins seems to follow a tissue-specific pattern
based upon experiments performed in rhesus monkeys by
slayden et al. (1993, 1998). antiprogestin treatment caused
inhibition of oestrogen-dependent proliferation in the endometrium, but did not affect oestrogen-dependent differentiation in
the oviduct of rhesus monkeys. in a more recent paper, this
group reported results comparable with our observations and
employed a similar approach of histomorphological measurements after injection of another antiprogestin (zk 137 316)
during spontaneous cycles in rhesus monkeys (slayden et al.,
1998). stromal compaction increased in all antiprogestintreated monkeys, while contradictory observations were made
204

in glands: zk 137 316 treatment enhanced the expression of
the proliferation marker ki-67 dose-dependently, while the
rate of mitosis was suppressed at higher doses. the authors
concluded that the effects of zk 137 316 can be explained
only partly by inhibition of progesterone action. the effects
of  xxxd2037xxx  are also inhibited by this compound.
further analysis of antiprogestin action in the endometrium
revealed that oestrogen-dependent pathways seem to be only
partially antagonized. even in the presence of high plasma
concentrations of  xxxd2037xxx , tissue growth was inhibited
although other  xxxg730xxx -mediated effects, e.g. upregulation of or and pr levels, were not disrupted by antiprogestins (neulen et al., 1990, 1996; slayden and brenner, 1994).

mifepristone action in primate endometrium

treatment-induced reduction in the production of vegf/ xxxg2413xxx 
would be in agreement with the observed high stromal cell
density (yuan et al., 1996). impairment of angiogenesis and
vascular permeability may be a mechanism whereby mifepristone inhibits oestrogen-dependent growth without affecting
other oestrogen-dependent pathways.
thus, several mechanisms of action of antiprogestins might
contribute to their potential usefulness as contraceptive agents
preventing implantation: besides their antiprogestogenic
potency blocking differentiation, endometrial growth is inhibited by a disturbance of normal stromal function. additionally,
mifepristone was shown to inhibit the growth and viability of
preimplantation-stage embryos in the rhesus monkey (ghosh
et al., 1997).
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that the antiprogestin,
mifepristone, affects stromal and glandular morphology in
primate endometrium in a disparate fashion. in the stroma,
mifepristone antagonizes the action of  xxxd2037xxx , and increases
cellular density by an as yet unidentified mechanism. in glands,
mifepristone antagonizes the action of progesterone and blocks
secretory transformation. both actions appear to be mediated
by the pr. these findings might be important in designing
contraceptive strategies which prevent implantation.

the antiproliferative action of mifepristone does not require
competition with progestins at the pr level. in fact, this effect
was observed paradoxically, even in the absence of its cognate
agonist, progesterone (wolf et al., 1989; chwalisz et al., 1991;
slayden and brenner, 1994; cameron et al., 1996b; grow
et al., 1996; neulen et al., 1996).
as a potential molecular mechanism to explain the tissuespecific antioestrogenic activities of antiprogestins, it was
suggested—based upon experiments in transfected mammalian
cells—that the a-isoform of the human pr can act as a
dominant inhibitor of or-dependent transcriptional activity in
the presence of antiprogestins (mcdonnell and goldman,
1994). in-vivo studies investigating or-dependent signalling
showed that the pathways regulating cell proliferation are not
completely impaired during mifepristone treatment. studies in
human (cameron et al., 1996b) and non-human (heikinheimo
et al., 1996; slayden et al., 1998) primate endometrium
demonstrated a divergence between lack of mitosis and an
increase of cell cycle-promoting factors involved in mitosis
such as pcna, ki-67 and cyclin-b during mifepristone treatment. based on these data, it was proposed by heikinheimo
et al. (1996) that mifepristone treatment induces a cell cycle
block in the g2–m interphase, preventing the cell from
undergoing mitosis at the stage where cell cycle-promoting
factors are already expressed.
the results obtained in the present study are in agreement
with the studies referenced above by showing that, after 2
weeks of mifepristone treatment, stromal compaction rather
than antiproliferative action in glands is associated with its
growth inhibitory effect. our data suggest that a disturbance
of normal stromal function may explain why antiprogestin
treatment ultimately leads to endometrial atrophy. the vasculature represents an important component of the stroma, and
formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) in a menstrual
cycle-dependent pattern was described as a distinctive process
during cyclic development of the endometrium (markee, 1940;
findlay, 1986). it was also shown that menstrual cycledependent changes in blood vessel permeability occur which
most likely cause stromal oedema (torry et al., 1996). indeed,
studies investigating the ultrastructure of the endometrium
after mifepristone exposure could identify blood vessels as a
target of antiprogestin action (johannisson et al., 1989), but
as yet it is unknown what is mediating these effects. we and
others recently demonstrated that mifepristone treatment was
associated with reduced expression levels of the specific
angiogenesis and vasopermeability factor (vascular endothelial
growth factor/ xxxg2413xxx ; vegf/ xxxg2413xxx ) in
primate endometrium (greb et al., 1995, 1997; ghosh et al.,
1998). preliminary data from endometrial cells in culture
suggest an upregulation of vegf-expression levels by progestins (shifren et al., 1996; sharkey et al., 1997). since vegf
is a very potent stimulator of vasopermeability (senger et al.,
1993), the distinctive compaction of the stroma in our study
would suggest an inhibition in the production of vegf/
 xxxg2413xxx  as a potential mechanism for the morphological effects
associated with chronic mifepristone treatment. if we presume
that stromal compaction is due to a lack of interstitial fluid
possibly caused by decreased vasopermeability, mifepristone
